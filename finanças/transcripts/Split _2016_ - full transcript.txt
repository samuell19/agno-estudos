- Happy Birthday! - Hey, birthday cake! - There I am. - Thank you. That's nice! Wait, everybody wants this? That's what happens when you do a mercy invite. I believe you manage to invite everyone. Dad, I can't invite everyone in my art class, except for one person without social networking evidence, inflicting more pain on that person wasn't intended. - And I'm not a monster. - I'm proud of you, I think. She gets detention a lot, and she yells at teacher sometimes. And there was a rumor that went around that she just kept running from home. Maybe she can UBER. I seriously believe that we can go home now. Did I mistakenly convey this is a democracy? We are not going until she gets picked up. The car broke down. I'm just gonna take the bus. You're not taking a bus, I'll drive you home. Claire has almost saved her half of the money she needs for her car. Isn't that right? At least it'll be one of a few times left that I can drive you guys around. You won't be able to hear my Dad tell jokes that only he thinks are funny for an entire car ride, unless you come. You don't really wanna miss that. Wow, I got more gifts than I thought you did. Can I put this in here? Yeah, yeah, I'll get it. Thank you, Marcia. Maybe he's just (). Maybe he's just pretend to worry. Can I help you? What? This is the one he's so, he's really funny. - He does this weekly video. - Wait a minute. That's so random. So weird. - You look praise on him. I don't get it. - Post it! - Why don't you get it? - I just don't get it. - He is cute. - No, his eyebrows are just like.. Shut up! His eyebrows, that's the one thing.. Yeah! That gets you! Okay, that's funny, yeah. - You see how he does that? - How does he even do that? Wa.. wait, why I let you see it. - Watching, yes! - This is so bad! Hey! Pardon me, Sir. I think you have the wrong car. We woke up in here. What the hell is going on? What are we doing here? What happened to my dad? He's out there. Do you know what happened to my dad? I choose you first. It's only gonna be a minute. Pee on yourself. Pee on yourself. No! No! No! Don't! No! Open the door! I'm here, okay? Are you okay? He wanted me dance for him. The outer door is locked. Everything is okay. We're okay. We're okay. I hear the tiny soul splashed. And here it comes, a freak of nature, like this, so he comes across the stream. And he's so tall, that the water doesn't even get to his belly. Then he stops. My heart's coming out of my chest. You got bug fever. Uncle John's got bug fever. That's not true, Casey. Your dad is a liar. - How big was the rack? - It was huge! - Where is supposed *** you shot, Casey? - At the body. - And why is he looking at the rack? - 'Cause he got bug fever. She'll say anything you've said. Are you gonna do that when you got your mentored hunting license in 3 years? No, Sir. Be sure you put your gloves on after you finish. Your feet and your hands get cold first out there. Three students abducted. The father of one of the students woke up daze from in King of Prussia, reportedly drugged, he found the kids and the car missing. Neighbors are in disbelief. A normally quiet convenient is real after the savage. If you any information concerning these girls you are heard, please contact the police. "Barry S: I need to see you. Urgent." Doesn't matter if you open that door, Claire. There is a second locked door. He's gonna come in here again. And his second in, we're not letting him take one of us out again. We just grided and screamed. We didn't hurt him because we were afraid to get him upset. God, that's victim's shit! Jesus! We should fight him. We should drop a crazy ass balm on him. I saw him carried one of you and laid you in the bed like you had nothing. Punching him would not gonna help us out. I took, I took six months of kempo karate class. And you distract him with pain. Everything is so easy for you guys. You do one thing, he can predict the next thing. It's not the way it's gonna be in this situation. We're not getting out of here! You're saying, you're not gonna fight with everything in you? You know, the only chance.. The only chance we have.. Is if all three of us go crazy on this guy. We have to hurry. We need you, Casey. Claire is smart, let's listen to her. I'll do it if you're gonna do it, too. - We can win. - He'll hurt us. Now, shut up, both of you. You're gonna pick your miserable self up and help us get out of here. Blow me. And your 6 months of karate at the King of Prussia Mall can blow me, too. No, no, you can't do this today! You can't do this right now! Why are you do this! Why are you act like this? Why do act like you're not one of us? When you're aiming casey always keep both eyes open cover your target with the barrel then move with it to get its pace I'm warning you, it can be frustrating for first times either you had to shoot under it or behind it if you learn to stay with it females are smaller than males but you know the answer hehehe females use their nose to save stay alives they make sure they have covers they always remember the're trying to stay alive Bucks go off by themselves Bucks get down during mating season boys make too much noise he he he so do and you're that boy? right Yes. You are Hey I'll let you know when I hear something that makes sense. We don't even know what this is yet. Hi! I was inspired. No, no, that one, before the pink fraco, That supposed to be like a.. Like a tailored jacket.. But I'm gonna himp her with newspaper headlines. Well, I'm a simple blouse and skirt person, but these.. These are very artistic, Barry. Just the kinda thing Hamptons' ladies would spend 15000 dollars on to wear once at a charity ball. Shut up! You know, I can't stay too long. This is just a visit. Well, tell me what's going on? What? You mean the email? It's just the usual thing. Just feeling a bit overwhelmed. Your email made it sounds specific and time related. - Are, are you looking for something? - No. I'm just admiring. - I'm better now. - How's work? - Great! - When I last spoke to them, they believe you were a model employee. They found you meticulous and conscientious. - You know this, right? - I do. You've managed there for 10 years. It's functioning very well, Barry. And it's a rare and wonderful place for you to work. - Yes it is. - You know, of all my other clients with your disorder, you've been the most consistent at your job. Did something happen, Barry? How old are you? The internet isn't consistent on this point. Why is that on your mind? Who's gonna look after you when you retired or passed on? You know, we're gonna have to take care of ourselves and nobody even believes that we exist. If ever something would happened to me, I've made arrangements with a colleague from Baltimore to take over. Hmm.. Hey, you a.. you live alone? - You know this. - I'm sorry, I just meant how long? Always. That must be so lonely. You know what, I'm.. I'm doing much better. I shouldn't have emailed you. I'm just.. Look at me, I'm too impulsive. By the way, is anybody listening? Does anybody care about us? Yes, the University of Paris asked me to do a lecture, in fact. I'm going to be doing it via Skype, from right here. People are believing more. - Let's meet at our usual time next week. - I'd rather you didn't leave, Barry. Did something happen? Don't worry, this was just a visit. I'm doing much better. And what's with your sketches, Barry? You're usually very protective of them. Yeah, thanks. I'll see you next week at our usual time. Thanks for fighting for us, Dr. Fletcher. - Thanks, Dr. Fletcher. - You're welcome. - I just think I'm gonna blow it. - No, it would be great. - I'll see you next week. - Okay, thank you. I don't know how you work with those people. - With what people? - Your patients. You can't use your thumbs to spin the wheel, dumb asses! They always use their thumbs! Well, we look at people who've been shattered and different as less than, What if, they are more than us? What? You believe them? Your patients? You know, just between you and me. Yes, I do. Flick it! Flick it! I don't believe it. No offense. That! I need to buy that. - He's back. - There is a lady outside. - Dennis, admit what you've done. - Don't get upset. Take down, I'm getting frightened. I thought that you had this under control. - Please tell me it's not too late. - The food in the waiting. Is she in that room? - We are here! - Help us! - We are here! - Jesus, how many are they? - No, no, don't go in there! Don't worry. I'll talk to him. He listens to me. He's not well. He knows what you're here for. He's not allowed to touch you. He knows that. - Karen. - Joe. They said you can have your own part at the national conference. They conceded, however, I can be part of the mood disorder pattern. - It's not a mood disorder. - I'm aware your beliefs, Karen. Well, were they open this time with a new evidence? One of your arguments is a dog. You submitted video of a dog acting differently to one of your patients at different time. It is more dramatic than that. They are what they believe they are. The brain has learned to defend itself. You treated them like they're supernaturally gifted. Like they have powers or something. Karen, these are patients. They have been to trauma. And perhaps now they're capable of something we're not. We have brain scans now. DID patients have changed their body chemistry with their thoughts. He was just trying to scare us. He was making a fool conversation with himself. What was that line about the food is waiting? Does everyone get out wacked? Just listen, we need to get out of here now. Yeah, no, please. Keep your area neat. The bathroom is unacceptable. I'll make it easy. I, I've called a code of this. Use the blue bottle for the floor. And the pink bottle for ceramic surfaces. Patricia has reminded me that.. I was sent to get you for a reason. That you are sacred food. And I promise not to bother you again. Maybe he has a dog or something. I think he's gonna feed us to his dogs. Casey. Casey! My name is Hedwig. I have red socks. He's on the move. What? He's on the move. - Who? - Someone who's coming for you. And you're not gonna like it. You guys make noises in your sleep. - Tell us. - I'm not supposed to say. Hmm.. But, he's done awful things to people. And he'll do awful things to you. - I have blue socks, too. - His food? - How old are you? - Nine. So you're not the guy that took us? - No. - You're not the lady? What are you blind? - You don't know how they think? - No, they don't, they don't tell me much. I just ate a hotdog. Could you help us, Hedwig? No. I'm, I'm not even supposed to be here. I stole a light from Mr. Dennis, but he'll be back real soon. I can't steal a light for too long or he'll know and get angry, etcetera. - See you! - Wait! We heard something. We didn't understand it, but now we do. - Do you know what we heard? - What did you hear? Come here. I'll whisper it to you. Okay. This guy.. Is coming for you. - You're a big liar. - I never lie, Hedwig. But, but Mr. Dennis.. He said that he followed those two girls for four days. And that he knew, that they were the ones that he would want. When you're not around, Dennis and the lady talked about it. They talked about how he wants a boy this time. They're going to give him you. No, Mrs. Patricia, she said.. She said, she's not mad at me anymore. She sings to me sometimes. I think Mrs. Patricia still a little mad at you. Mrs. Patricia thinks I'm.. She thinks I'm stupid. She thinks I made silly mistakes. Look at me, we're like your babysitters. I'll let you watch TV and make you a fun diner. We all need to get out of here. You could show us the way out. We can be out before anybody gets back. But we have to hurry, Hedwig. We have to hurry and get out of here. Wait, wait a minute. It took forever to get this place safe without anybody to work here. You can't get out of here! - I have to blow my nose. - No, no, please do not go! Who's coming? - This is seriously scary. - No one is coming. He said something. He said something about making the room safe. This is all new drywall. It wasn't safe. Wait a minute, we know he'll notice about this? Casey, you're right. There's something in here. He must covering up the way out. Tell me if you see him. Casey, tell us what you see! He's here. You can't let him in, you can't let him in! This is our one chance. - We're not gonna make it. - Yes, we are! Wha.. Hey, what are you guys doing? Okay, quit it. Hey guys! - Let me in. - Give us a second, we are changing. What are you guys doing? Let me in! Guys, you're not being funny. You're being *** now. I'm gonna ***. Just keep him there as long as you can. You're gonna get me in trouble. Guys! Watch out. I thought I lost you. Would you step outside, please? You like to make fun of us. But, we're more powerful than you think. Step outside. Please. You shouldn't trick children. That shows who you are. Look at your sweater. It's ruined, it's dirty. Remove it. I'm trying to be good. You'll not see your friend again. She'll be kept separate. Now, take off your skirt and take off your shirt. Because you got all dirty from the dust. One identitiy in an individual with Dissociative Identity Disorder Can have high chilesterol. One. There are been cases where one identity is allergic to bee stings. The others are not. Are there moments where two identities can co-exist at the same time? There are times when two identities can take the light or the spot, or consciousness at the same time. This happened with a student that I was working with. And her left and right hands were taking notes in different handwritings about separate things at the same time. The differences in the identities can be dramatic. As much as the difference between you and me, and every person in that auditorium. The identities have different IQs. They have different physical strenghts. One personality is a Russian weightlifter, and can lift three times of his body weight. Their ability to hyperfocus and have different experiences is astounding. Have these individuals through their suffering unlocked the potential of the brain? Is this the ultimate doorway to all things we called unknown? Is this where our sense of the supernatural comes from? It's about depth and a.. And curves. And, hey, you see that one? It's kinda like a senile sweaty dress. Who are you? Barry. I don't think you are. I've developed a nose for sensing whom I'm talking to and whom I'm not. Have I done something? You've emailed for an unscheduled appointment two days in a row. I just feel overwhelmed, I've gotten some issues. I think Orwell, or Jade, or Samuel.. Or Heinrich had the light for a moment and emailed me. And you're here to tell me everything is okay. I emailed you. May I talk to one of them, please? That can't happen. I told them that I wanna spend the session with you today. I'm gonna ask again. To whom am I speaking with now? Dr. Fletcher, it's Barry. It doesn't seem like Barry. Barry is an extroverted leader. Of course, I am. I'm gonna take a professional guess. Based on the description of all 23 identities that live in Kevin's body, that I've gotten from Barry. I think, I'm talking to Dennis. But he's been banned from the light because among other reasons. He has a proclivity to watch young girls dance naked, which he himself knows it's wrong. And he's fought against it with a little success. I'm encouraged we can finally meet. And I guess this because you've adjusted the chocolate dish twice. Since you came in here and I understand you have OCD. Now I see, now I see. That's clever. - But I'm not Dennis. - And you and Patricia.. Have been banned from the light for quite a while now. Primarily, shall we say because of your beliefs. Patricia and Dennis are very unstable. I'm not Dennis. Have you both take in charge now? Please believe me, I'm Barry. You must forgive me, my job is to challange you. And as you must know by now, I have plenty of opinions about how everyone should live their lives. Ask me something about fashion, I'll prove it. Or.. Or you.. Look, look, look. You see, I'm not Dennis. You want me to do something else? You got ice cream? This shirt is cotton blend anyway. The color is from three seasons ago. It's nude, I mean, come on. Jay, what health conscious fast food prepare Did you originally buy these chicken wings, you're so lovingly heated it in minor suicidal gesture? Hooters. You can't just threw them out, Dr. Fletcher. This is so wrong on so many levels. We finished about 3:15, so look around 3:18. You're getting a little softer on the middle, Jay. The outers of hooters play on *** need for fat, and men *** to be in the proximity of augmented breasts. It's like Henry the 5th running a fast food franchise. - It's a good place, Dr. Fletcher. - Hmm.. right. How did you know the trash will be spilled? How can I say this, Jay, you're not the most meticulous of people. This guys isn't very neat as he walked right through the trash. No, Jay. A normal person would've walked around that. That was an act. What are your object, Dennis? Or is it Patricia who deciding things? We're not gonna die. Bad things happened. But not like this. Casey. Talk to me. We need to get through a window or a door? The trail. Casey, it's about where you can or can't. You have to outsmart this animal. So you didn't used to like to come out here. This is like our family tradition, right? - Good shooting, Bro. - Thank you, John. I have your meal, sleepyhead. Eat. It's good? It's *** paprika in it. I'm sorry. I think I'll put a pretty flower in your hair. Oh, yeah. This is to show how important you are. Come along. And we'll have a proper meal. I understand, these must all seem so unsatisfactory for you. But, we are doing the best we can. Good? - Can Claire come eat with us? - No, I'm afraid that can't happen. She almost ruined our big reception. I've heard that Asian people's music helps digestion. I'll make you a second sandwich. Do you know.. How many of lions can eat 35 pounds a day? A bug can loose 30% of its weight during mating season chasing those round? That creep ***, right? Means they travel around during those ***. Good for you. It's crooked. Forgive me. I don't know if you know, but.. Tigers have only 30 teeth. That's 12 less than a dog. I thought that was a fun fact. Go to your room, shut the door. Do it now. "In the sun, we'll find our passion" "In the sun, we will find our purpose" You've always been protected, you've never truly suffered. That's why we chose you. You've always been asleep. You've had a chance. You've never had a chance. The dark-haired girl, she's gonna be kept in another closet. I might as well know what this point. The beast is coming for you. All three of you. You'll gonna be kept separate. You've got a crumb on your shirt. Please take it off. Just.. just take it off. It wasn't nice what you said about Mrs. Patricia. You lied. I'm sorry about that, Hedwig. You guys lied to me, made me scare, etcetera. Mr. Dennis says you wear a lot of shirts. I like this shirt. Thank you. Do you know who Dennis and Mrs. Patricia are? No. See, everyone of us has to wait in a chair. And Barry, he decides to stand in the light. But Barry lost that power because of me. I can wish myself in the light anytime I want with a special power. And Barry just have to keep sitting in his chair, if I wanted to. That's why Dennis and Mrs. Patricia said I could be with them. Dennis and Mrs. Patricia, they believe in the beast and what it can do. Have you seen him? The.. beast? No. Can I kiss you? I wanted to kiss the other girl with the dark-hair, but she's in trouble. So you want to? I don't know much about kissing, though. Yeah. Okay. Okay, here we.. One, two, three. You might be pregnant now. - Am I a good kisser? - Yeah. I love dancing. You like dancing? I like dancing to my CD player in my room. Kanye West is my main man. We got my CD player set up in my room, right next to my window. I'm like.. Ugh.. "Guess the moves!" Wow! Maybe I could watch you dance and listen to music with you. - No, my music is in my room. - Wow, right. Maybe you could sneak me there. Are you trying to trick me, etcetera? I'll tell on you. - I'm telling on you! - I'll tell you something. And you can tell me if I'm lying or not, okay? - Like a test, okay? - Uh huh. I get into trouble at school on purpose. So I can get sent to detention. To get away from everyone. So that I can be alone. Okay, I'll show you something cool in my room. Okay. But after Mr. Dennis has finished to getting ready with the ritual. I have to go. He's got an appointment. When I fall sleeping, one of the others keep trying to reach what the doctor lady tell on us. That pant, it's got a red lining. You can see it down the side. We've been talking about silk and wool blonde for 20 minutes. Can I guess that you emailed me in the middle of the night, for an emergency session. Due to *** issues? Aha! I was down and I emailed you. And I woke up and I feel better. I.. I feel better. I had a thought. I want to talk about the incident at work. It's okay, Barry. You're safe. I just wanna bring the details back. We're just talk about the details. A high school from Camden, New Jersey was on a field trip at your place of work. And two young ladies came up to you. And one took your hand and put it under her shirt on her breast. And the second did the same. And then they just run off, laughing to their friends. You thought that they might be on a dare. You said they were 17 or 18. You said it upset you for days. It was just a teenage prank. I get that now. And see, that's my mistake. I believe that I went over this incident with you too fast. Although you said, you were fine. And the other identities I met with said, it was fine. I believe that this.. Brought up issues from when you were a child and abused. Sometimes another incident of abuse can cause suppressed personalities to take the light. Dennis, if this is you.. I completely understand.. Why you felt the need to take over and protect the others. Doctor, not this again. The others told me that you and Patricia told the group about this beast. And I told them that these are just scary stories that Dennis and Patricia tell the others, to scare them. How this beast can crawl on walls, like the best rock climbers using this lightest friction and in perfections. To hold his body close to seemingly sheer surfaces. How his skin is thick and tough, like rhinoceros. Do you really believe the stories about the beast? If this is you, Dennis, I understand why Kevin needs you. You are strong and disciplined. You are precise. And you will not be taken advantage of. You can trust me. For example, I do have the ability to use Kevin's full name and bring him forth, as he has in the past. But I wouldn't do that. I know that, that would be chaos for all of you. Everyone would grab the light. I don't wanna hurt any of you that way. You don't have to hide. I know you are someone who cares for Kevin. You are not evil to me. You were necessary. Dennis, is that you? They keep calling us the horde. The others, you know. Mrs. Patricia and I, we're ridiculed. No, we're not perfect. But, we don't deserve to be ridiculed. We're all struggling. They have to admit that. I am pleased to meet you, Dennis. You, too. I seemed you don't know who emailed me for the emergency session. One of the others. - Are you in charge? - Yeah, we've taken charge. We're the only one who can protect Kevin. We're all here to protect Kevin. He's very weak. He doesn't know how powerful we can be. Would you mind telling me, when you first came into existence? And how you and Patricia, the other undesireable identity, became aligned? That's okay. Do you still have strong beliefs? - That depends on what. - The story of the beast. One thing, Dennis, that may comfort you if you are confused, is that you've met the other alters. You're all in a room in chairs, right? Yeah. But you never met the beast? Because he doesn't reside with the rest of you? Because he resides in the train yard, as the story goes. Because Kevin's dad left on the train. But the fact is, you and Patricia have never met the beast. - Have you? - No. That's because he's not an alter. He's not the 24th identity. He is a fantasy. Hurry up! Let's go! Come on, it's time! - Wow. - I know. - This is your CD player? - Yeah. You don't like it? It's not new. No, no, I'm just a.. I'm confused. You said it's near a window. Oh, that's here! Watch. Now, it's closed. Now, it's open. Now, it's closed. Now, it's open. Do you think it was a real window? So you could leave, etcetera? Help me get out of here, Hedwig. Just give me the keys and let me out the door. Please. Ms. Patricia said that nobody'll make fun of me anymore when the beast comes. She said that everyone must see how amazing I am. And that all of my silly mistakes, they won't matter anymore. - I think you should go back to your room. - No, wait! Please! I wanna hear your Kanye West albums! Show me your room! Let's stay here or I'll still leave! I can't. You said you wanna show me something cool, right? - Show me something! - I don't want to! - Please! This! - Wow! It's nice. - It's not a toy. - Is this real? - Yes. It's Mr. Dennis'. He doesn't even know I stole it. Pretty cool, right? You can listen people talking and they don't even know you're listening. - Who does this talk to? - Don't touch that. I just want to see if it works. Hey, don't touch the buttons. You're gonna get us found out. Vince here, whaddup? Do not talk. Whaddup? - Hello? - Don't! Who is this? Hello? Hello, my name is Casey Cooke! I'm being held in a basement! I've been abducted with two other girls! Who the hell is this? Hello? Casey Cooke! I've been abducted! You need to find me! Betty, is that you? This isn't fun. Call the police! I must be near you. I'm being held in a basement or something. Okay, Betty, listen. Tell Larry to get ***. Tell him I still got his headphones. I don't know where I am. There is a man here. He abducted us and he's going to kill me. You may have a few hours left. Please. I'm begging you. Somebody save us. Who is this? And how did you get one of our walkies? Put your hands together in contrition. "In the sun, we will find our passion." "In the sun, we will find our purpose." I read that on a symphaty card in the supermarket. It was for funerals, but I saw it was beautiful. Dennis will explain the meaning of this evening. The beast is a scenting creature, who represents the highest form of human evolution. He believes the time of ordinary humanity is over. I hope this makes you feel calm. You will be in the presents of something greater. I wish gonna ask you the last shirt, but I won't. Because tonight is a sacred night. It's almost over. Casey, come on! Let's pretend we're animals again! Come on! Casey, come on! This is our game! Or I'll tell your dad you're not being nice. Come on! Take off your stuff. Animals don't wear clothes. Come on! Hey, Casey-bear. This isn't funny. Is it loaded? Casey? I'm your uncle. Stop it, Casey! Put that gun down! I'm getting upset! I'm about to get very angry! You could've killed me. "We need you." - This place is closed. - No, it's okay. - You can't get in. - No, it's okay. Hello, Dennis. One of the others emailed me just now. - Is everything okay? - We're fine. Dennis, Kevin is really lucky to have you. You are quite extraordinary. I just don't want you guys get hurt. You think we're extraordinary? I like you Dennis. May I come in? And can we talk? I know you wanna tell me something. Why don't you just tell me? We're very similar, you and I. Both on the outside look and in. Please, sit. I don't get many visitors. I'll get you some water. They got a proper *** on the sales ads, but we're already here. They promoted me to ***, so I can have it. Who are you going to meet? I want to talk about Kevin and what his mother did to him. I remember the wall. I'm happy you're suddenly so open. Kevin's mother had read him 11 evil ways of punishing this 3 year-old. - Is that when you arrived in the light? - Yeah. The one way to avoid her attention was to keep everything spotless, everything perfect. I know you're coming from good intention, Dennis. But there are other ways to help Kevin now. I've lost so many patients into the system. I want you to know, Dennis. I will never stop fighting for you. My patients have become my family. They, what I've chose instead of a more traditional path. I hope you feel you can be truly honest with me. I actually wanna be honest with you. I lied before when you asked, if I'd ever met the beast. I said "no. That really isn't true." You wrote about a woman in Germany, who'd been blind for 10 years. And then, it was discovered that she had Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). Then three of her identities developed sight. You speculated that her optical nerves regenerated because of her beliefs. What are you trying to say? There are things, Dr. Fletcher, that all of us would find hard to believe. Are you trying to tell me there is a 24th identity? You protect the broken. When you said this situation was extraordinary, - I knew, you can maybe understand. - Understand what? The beast.. Is real. He's just emerged. You were right about everything. What does he look like? He is much bigger than I am. And I'm the biggest of all of us. He's tall, he's very muscular. He's got a long man hair and his fingers are twice the length of ours. He believes we're extraordinary. And we don't represent a mistake, but our potential. You say the same things. - He's on the move. - What's that mean? I don't understand. He can't be real. There must be limits to what a human being can become. And there's another whole part of the story, isn't there? About the eating of the impure young? What does "impure" even mean? We should discuss that, so that you can understand fully. - Understand what? - Sometimes.. There's just no other way. Who are you going to meet? Him. You know what, I would love to take notes on all of this. We should probably discuss this in a proper session tomorrow. Really? You're okay with this? This has been so wonderful, you're being so open. I can see that you feel very empowered by the philosophy of the beast. I'm going to go now. I knew you'd understand. I'll see ya. Would you mind.. If I use your bathroom? No. It's down the hall, near the stairs on your left. - I'll wait you. - Okay. Who are you? - Who is it? Help me. - Help me. Is someone there? - Oh, my God. - Please, help me! They will never reach their potential. They don't really matter. Listen to me, Dennis. I should've listened better. I should've understood what you can bluffed how powerful you are. Patricia says with your ways of working, - The world will understand now. - Dennis, This is *** wrong. These young women are suffering. This is a crime. I can't let you keep them here. We've got to stop this. This identity is monstrous. I'm really sad you feel this way. Can't you see? He is formed because of your time in this place? There was a lady. Someone's here! We need to get out of these rooms! Is there anything in the room? Anything that we could use? There's nothing in here. There is a hanger. Thank you, Dennis. Here you go, Sir. It sounded like there were slide bolts on the outside of our doors. See if you can move the lock through the crack in the door. "Unable to connect to the internet" Stay calm, we're getting out of here. We're gonna get Casey. You can do this, Marcia. It's regarded to Chahamanas defeated Muhammad, of course. The conquests between 1192-1200. I would like Muhammad to present ultimatum, that Prithviraj "either positize or fight". Prithviraj's defines.. We should stand up to the horde's advances and face up their scared tactic. We should shook.. I hate my insulin shots. No one else around here has to take them. Why do I have diabetes? All the doctors, besides Dr. Fletcher, say that we're the same person, just personalities. How do you explain I'm the one who need this? You motherfuck.. I'm wearing cargo pants in the 90s. And a scarf. If it wasn't for the Varvatos t-shirt underneath, that'd be a mess. I got notice of something right now. I'm worried sick. I have a very bad feeling that I'm losing time. I decide who gets the light, right? I think someone is stealing the light from me when I'm not aware. The horde keep obsessing about the "ones who haven't sufferred".. I don't know where they're going with this, but it scares me. Think of yoursel in a couple hours at home. On the couch in that ugly sweater that you love. It's an animal. He barks like this when there's a coyote or something. Kev.. Kev.. Kev.. Kev.. Thank you for helping us till now. Kev.. Kev.. And yes, I should tell Dr. Fletcher about this, but.. She'll worry. She is such a sweet woman. I believe, I will go for a nice walk. And think this through organization, like.. That's my journal for Monday. Ciao. Claire? Marcia? Claire! Claire, let's go! SAY HIS NAME Kevin Wendell Crumb. Kevin Wendell Crumb? Kevin Wendell Crumb. Kevin Wendell Crumb! Kevin Wendell Crumb. Kevin Wendell Crumb. You made a mess. Come out here. Kevin Wendell Crumb! You made a mess! Get out there! Who are you? Wha.. What's happening? Something horrible. What I do? Did I hurt you? Dr. Fletcher. Dr. Fletcher! - Who did that? - You did. I swear, I was on a bus. I don't remember anything after that. Is this still September 18, 2014, right? There's a shotgun I bought. It's in the bottom cabin that hidden behind things? The shots are in my uniform closet, out in the service wall. Kill me. Kill me. Whoa, wait, wait, wait! No, no, don't do that! He can't handle reality. My name is Jade. Has Dr. Fletcher been getting our emails? This is what we have to do. We.. Us in 1008. When Anandapala suffered to show his most crushing defeat and Mahmud overrun the entire of Punjab, where he's in taking the fame Temple of Kangra. We have been wronged by this alliance, this horde of Patricia, Dennis and the boy. Their actions do not represent us! Everybody just take a minute! Oooh.. Baby girl.. They've been stealing control of the light from me, but their group are gonna work through this. Honey, my name is Barry. You shouldn't've used the walkie talkie. They almost caught us. Stop it, Hedwig! You never right. Look at you! You're so afraid in the bud. Dennis and Mrs. Patricia are in charge because of me! I'm gonna give the light to them now. No one is allow to make fun of me anymore! Thank you, Hedwig. - Everything's fine now. - Kevin Wendell Crumb. Kevin is asleep. We've made him sleep far away. You can call his name all your night, dear bird, but he's not going to hear you. The beast has shed with us his dreams of a larger group to sustain him. No! Ten to twelve unworthed young next time. This is just the start! Let go! Oh, my God! Help me! Help! Help! Help! It runs in our family. My daddy died, too. Same way, heart attack. But you don't need to worry. I'm going to take care of you. Well, you won't be given me any trouble, will you? I know you won't, sweety. We are glorious! We will no longer be afraid! Only through pain.. Can you achieve your greatness! The impure are the untouched, the unburned, the unslain! Those who have not been torn, have no value in themselves, and no place in this world! They are asleep! Your gun cannot hurt me. Can't you see? I am not human. Kevin is a man. I am much more. You are different from the rest. Your heart is pure. Rejoice! The broken are the more evolved! Rejoice! What in the name of Mary-Joseph! What are you doing in this area? Just keep walking, honey. They won't do nothing. Vince, call the police! She said some people got hurt in the area below maintenance. Okay. I'm just gonna check you. The third deceased name of Dr. Karen Fletcher. Still trying to look out her family. Casey Cooke's guardian's here. You uncle's here. You ready to go? And then no through. We are what we believe we are. Holy shit! This is so cool! They're gonna believe we exist now, right? They gotta have to. So, what are we do now? We trust in him. He'll protect us. Look, what he can do. Let him show the world how powerful we can be. The suspected murderer, Kevin Crumb, suffers from the controversial psychological disorder, DID. The rumors coming out of the scene almost unbelievable. There are conflicting stories if the suspect is alive or dead after sustaining 2 point length gunshot. Reports even indicate one of his personality is an amalgam of various animals in the Philadelphia Zoo, where he worked. The press is already referring to the alleged attacker by a dork name, leaked by a source close to the case. Because o his many personalities, he is being called "The Horde". This is like that crazy guy in the wheelchair that they put away 15 years ago. And he gave him a funny name, too. What was it? - Mr. Glass. - Oh, yeah.
