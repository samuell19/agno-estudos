How do you like the GT? Actually, I prefer the Q4. Better turning radius. Have a nice day, sir. - Ah or a, por favor. - Hágame el favor. Sí, ya sé, Benny... - Benny, por favor, dame chance. - Oye, pero ¿por qué discutes conmigo? Que te metas a lavar las manos ah or a. No, no. Frank, Frank. Yeah, no, no, no. My client is not going above five! - Chad, listen. Six million is completely... - No! I said five, not six! - We're worth at least six million. - No, do not talk over me! 어, 어. 진자. 어. 두시. 숙제 많다 넌 발레 해야 되고, 넌 태권도 해야 되고 너네들 오늘 피아노 30분 해야 돼, 알았지? Ey, tan Linda. Eso, eso. Sonríe. Not only will this new development provide affordable housing and much-needed retail space, it will add hundreds of jobs. Well-paying, green jobs. My wife Kathryn and I, along with Councilman Garcia, couldn't be prouder to be partnering with the wonderful people of this community. Boo! You're gonna have your name all over this city. See you, Marco. I promise I'll know my lines by tomorrow. - Bye, Sofia. - Bye. Don't... Don't say anything. I didn't. I'm allowed to smile. Dad, go, go, go, go. Oh, Mr. Kim. Everything okay? Oh, yeah, yeah. Toilet flush good. No, no! ¡Amá! Cheeseburger and fries. Turkey sandwich and coleslaw. I'm missing something. What is it? I'm missing something. - Line! - Let's reset. Let's reset. What is that stupid... I can't... This isn't even gonna be in the movie. It's gonna be... Can you not? The wrap party's tomorrow night. I assume you want me to get you out of that. - That's correct. - And Variety wants ten minutes. No, no, I'm already late. Anytime next week. Okay, don't take Olympic. There's a bunch of paparazzi out there. That was the second time I got Lady Gaga. Got a cool 500 for it. That's it? My quote's a minimum 750. Yeah, yeah. Mine too. - Is that somebody? - Nah, that's nobody. God, I've missed that hoodie. I hate how much this turns me on. So I was talking to one of the teachers at school. She's going through a divorce too, and... I'm not divorced. We're separated, okay? You need a candle in your bathroom or at least some kind of spray. Cochino! Will you tell my stupid brother how pretty the new music teacher is? She's fine. She's okay. She's about what you could probably get. You don't think she's pretty? You know who's pretty? The gym lady. With that whistle? What? Antonio. Hey. Sorry I'm early. We were just overstaffed today. Stay for dinner. We're making carne a sad a. Thanks, Clara, but I should probably get going. - Okay, Marco. Get your stuff, honey. - Coming, Mom. You okay? You seem upset. No. No, I'm fine. The bank denied my loan. So I have to take a year off from school. - Why? - Because... - Remember when my car broke down? - Yeah. I just... I fell behind on some payments, and… Two semesters. That's all I had left. How much do you need? I have some savings. Yeah. They want $12,850. You got that laying around? I-I can get a second job. Uh, we can figure this out. This... This isn't your problem. I want it to be my problem. Yeah, uh… Look, there's no real easy way to say this, but, uh, I started seeing someone. What? Who? His name is Ronnie. He's a Realtor. Ronnie the Realtor? The guy from the bus benches? This guy? - He's nice to me. - I'm not nice to you? I... Come on, Antonio. Let's not fight about this. Abuelita ran out of medicine. Tía says if she has another heart attack, you'll have to answer to the Virgin Mary. You know, she only gets religious when she's mad, so, good luck, Dad. Come on, mijo. - Did you eat? - Mm-hmm. - How was work? - It was good. That was life-changing. I've been doing a lot of Pilates. Who's that? Is that Kathryn? It doesn't matter. We have two more uninterrupted hours. Let's just shut the world out. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I can't... I can't do this. - You can't what? - Can't... I can't do this. I didn't even look that time. I need to go. I need to go and get away. No, no, no. Oh, don't go. Come on, stay. I'll order another bottle. You know how many people I've told about us? One person. My assistant. - How do you think I feel? - I'm a role model. Girls look up to me. I just started a company dedicated to telling women's stories. You were the one who told me to do that. - Yes, because I believe in you. - How can I explain this? "Oh, don't worry. I'm just sleeping around with someone else's husband. Using code names and having clandestine meetings like some kind of slutty spy." How do you explain it? I don't know, Olivia. Why don't you tell them that maybe… That you're in love with me? I do love you. - I love you so much. I just... - Yes. I know, and I love you. And events, they conspired against us. You know that. Look, I was gonna tell Kathryn that I was leaving. I was. - I know. - I had the speech. I had rehearsed. It was gonna be great and then, you know, well… her mom died. - Her mom died, then she got depressed. - Yeah. Yeah, it was a rough situation, okay? I'm just waiting for her to get her sea legs back, and then I'm gonna tell her. You know it's been a year? Literally. Today's our anniversary. And if you don't hate me, I have presents. Mmm. Okay. Now, I got some sparkly stuff too, but this is what I'm most excited about. It's Bette Davis's journal from when she was shooting Now, Voyager. That's... That's the movie where I fell in love with her. - Yeah. - How did you know that? Well, I listen. And… …I did a little research. You like it? It's perfect. Goodbye, Vincent. Goodbye, Vin... Okay. Okay. Okay. Oli... Olivia! I just need a little more time. I don't get it. This place was on fire last night. Rocky says Chateau is dead too. I'm calling it. - Please don't go out front. - Please don't follow me. - You're being reckless. - You're being reckless. Olivia! Don't follow me! Dave? - Billie Jean King? - Yep. Oh! - Oh, my word! - What... - Are you all right? Are you okay? - Yes, I'm just embarrassed. I never thought I would get hit by a parked car. The hell, man? This is my mom's car! - I'm sorry. I will pay for the damage. - People are looking. No, no, no! No, no. No damage. No scratch. Five stars. Oh, nice. - Can we please go up the stairs? - This man needs our help. - I'm okay. Don't worry about me. - Yeah, see. Let's just go back inside. - Are you sure? - I just wanna go home. You... Call me when you're divorced. Oh, you really are a safety risk. I'm gonna throw in a couple of reflectors so people can see you coming. Hey, Lu. One, eh, reflector. Your Spanish is terrible. - It is as good as your English, sir. - You wish. She's taking night classes, but I think not even all-day classes would help. My Spanish sucks. It is a source of great shame. Thank you for doing that in front of my daughter. Yeah. You know they're trying to kick us out? Some developer bought out the whole block. Fifteen years, and now they try to price us out. All of us too. Hope you like juice bars and spin classes. They want to replace your bike shop with bikes that don't go anywhere? Yeah. Oh, hey. You know what? Okay, there's a city council meeting next week. - We gotta pack the place out, okay? - Okay. Good. That mustache. I'm too much work. And I know that. Maybe I drew too hard a line, you know? Maybe I should call him. Is there someone else that you can talk to who might know you better? Jennifer Lawrence. Aren't you two, like, best friends? We were in a movie together. We played best friends. I don't even think she liked me. Okay. How about your mom? She called again last week. My mother was a drunk. She embezzled from me. I testified against her in court. She went to jail. You haven't googled me? I-I will now. Vanity Fair. Page 32.2018. It's actually pretty good. I mean, depressing. But hopeful, ultimately. The source close to the family is me. What? No. No. No! - How do you explain this? - It's bullshit. I've never met that woman once in my entire life. Look, I walked the councilman to his car and, sure, did I notice her? Maybe. There were lots of celebrities there. But there was also some Lakers there, and I was really excited about that. Says that you were having a lovers' spat. I never said a word to her. Look, I mean, you can't even... Just look at the picture for a second. Look at the picture. Let me... Sure, yeah, that's me, definitely, but who's that other guy? - That guy? - She was with that guy. She was with that guy? That guy. They were the ones who were bickering. They were in a whole thing. And we were all watching, and it was really... It was kind of uncomfortable for all of us. Okay. You must think that I am so stupid. I don't think that you're stupid. I would never call you stupid. Kathryn, look, it's the press, okay? The press always gets it wrong. You know this. I want to believe you. You can believe me. You can always believe me. Look, I... I know that I've made mistakes in the past, I do, but I'm happy, and I love you, and I would never do anything to jeopardize that. And I so wanna talk about this later tonight. I do. But obviously, I can't. I love you. I'm... I'm gonna call my lawyer from the car because they owe us an apology. Earhart opens in five days! I can't... I can't have this getting out there. I need it gone. She's on a party plane to London for her nephew's bar mitzvah. Why is she... Just tell her to call me the second she lands! I need my publicist! - She's saying, "Don't freak out." - Of course I'm freaking out! I'm having an anxiety attack! These are very judgmental times. You can't just be a good actress. You have to be a good person too. - Where the hell are my pills? - Okay. Bottom left. Next to your retainer. Okay, anticipate my needs. I have three studios circling this company, waiting to see how the box office does. If this movie tanks, you can say goodbye to all of it. The wellness days. The yoga retreats. The free water. All of it! Everything! Why isn't this opening? She's gonna divorce me. I'ma lose the company. She and her father, they're gonna squeeze me out. Daniel, you're my lawyer. I need you to fix this. Well, we could create a time machine and have you make better choices. I pay you not to judge me. Look, if I had a few weeks, maybe I could buy up enough shares - through an offshore... - I don't have a few weeks. Maybe you do. What if, and I'm just formulating this, we find the other guy in the photo and get him and Olivia to pretend to be a couple. That's a dumb idea. Keep going. All they'd have to do is be seen in public a few times, get some pictures out there, and before you know it, your lie becomes the truth. I like when my lies become truth. Okay, that's it. I'm canceling my two o'clock. - That is so hot. - Handcuff yourself to the outdoor shower. Come on. Give me the milk. - Oh, yeah? Tell me more, baby. - Hello? Tell me how bad you want it, Gordon. I'm sorry, I'm... I'm just the valet. Ooh, a valet? And I'm a horny, rich bitch. What are you gonna do to me? - Come on, Gordon. Tell me. - Hold, please. Hello? Have a nice day, Gordon. Welcome to Kobra, sir. Did you forget something? You're Antonio Flores, right? Olivia Allan is gonna go out with me? - That's right. - The famous actress? - Yes. - The beautiful one? Yes. You'll go out on a few dates. With me? Correct. And she'll pretend to be in love with you. In love like, you know, like… - Hugging? - Hugging. Probably some kissing. Kissing? And… How much do I have to pay? No. We pay you. Did Benny put you up to this? Where's Benny? You're one of his friends from the cigar store, right? - You got me. - Hijo de la... Mr. Flores, I work for a billionaire. We desperately need your help. You can name your price. $12,850? The exactness of the number surprised me too. Now it's your turn. Well, Olivia's not gonna be so easy. - I'll do it. - Really? If we can pull this off, it'll be a big story. The press will eat it up. It'll bury any talk about us. It's good. It's good. I knew that you loved me. I knew that you would do this for me. I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for Amelia Earhart. Now tell me about this man in the photograph. Antonio Miguel Flores. Age 47. Lives with his mom. $320 in the bank, yet has an excellent credit rating. That's a rare combination. Okay, there is no way she's dating someone who parks cars. I've been in this game a long time, ma'am. I've seen weirder couples. Much weirder. To be honest, it's the excellent credit rating I can't get my head around. Hello. Look in your rearview mirror. There's a Crown Victoria. I'm being followed? Love you, babe. You're doing great. That's Stegman. Ex LAPD. Works for Mrs. Royce. Take three deep breaths. - How do we know? - We have eyes on their eyes. The gentleman in the Subaru two cars back, that's Kapoor. He works for us. I'm your son... This is not my... Dad, get off the phone. Dad? Guys, I'm working. I gotta go. This is why I go to therapy! So your sister really wants you to give this music teacher a shot. Maybe I was too hard on her. This is from their retreat in Lake Arrowhead. She's a little pear-shaped, but she has nice elbows. Uh… - Hello. Welcome. - Hi. - Your ticket? - I'll just be one second. Hi. You must be Antonio's boss. I've heard so much about you. Do you mind if I steal this one away for lunch? You're a sweetheart. Thank you. Let's go. W-W-What's happening here? Oh, it's new. We don't want to, um, label it. You... You keep your car very clean. Oh, you know, I'm so embarrassed that you got roped into this. You don't have to make small talk if you don't… No, no, no. It's just that you can tell a lot about a person by how they treat their car. My assistant takes care of it. Hmm. They do a good job. All right, we're all set. My publicist tipped off the paparazzi. There will be paparazzi? That's kind of the entire point. I... I don't even like being in family photos. All you have to do is walk into the restaurant and have lunch with me. - Look, I park cars for people like you… - Uh-huh. …and I'm old enough to be your father. Do you think anyone will believe we're dating? Not if you can't stop sweating! You look like a dolphin. Here, towel off. - Get it. And take your little uniform off. - Yeah, yeah. Is your shit together? My shit is together. Okay. Showtime. - Olivia, Olivia! - Here! Olivia, right here. Right here! - Olivia! - Olivia! Over here! - Olivia! - Olivia! Welcome to Le Bilboquet. Olivia! Who's that? Is he somebody? Never seen him before. What happened to Vincent Royce? I've never met a Mr. Royce. This is my boyfriend, Antonio. Antonio! Hey, Antonio, you an actor? - He's a valet. - No, really? Yes, I've dated enough actors. They're too much work. Hey, hey, hey. - Olivia! Olivia! - Yes, thank you. No comments. Yeah, right here. One more. One more. Right here. Right here. - Hi. - Loved you in that dog movie. - Thank you. - Was that dog yours? - Hi. - My teenage daughter loves you. - Aw, thank you. - It's you! Olivia, one more? Everyone's looking at us. - I don't like it. - You get used to it. Don't they have enough? Oh, they never have enough, until they don't want any. Uh, can you say something? I'm gonna laugh really hard. I don't understand. What did he say? What did he say to you? That's the one they're gonna run. They always use the laughing shot. Ms. Allan, are you ready to order? I'll have a small, chopped salad. Vinaigrette, unless it's balsamic, then I'll have it on the side. - Sure thing. - Thanks, Bill. Sir? Um… What is the... Do you sell hamburgers here? Yeah, we can do that for you. How would you like it prepared? With lettuce and tomato, please. Uh, I meant the meat. On a bun. Under the lettuce and tomato. Uh, how would you like it cooked, sir? Very cooked. All the way through. Ah! Well-done. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Maybe the less you say, the better. Okay. Okay. Ah, I'm gonna wash my hands. I touch a lot of keys, you know? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. Excuse me. Can I get some more water? Uh, no, actually, I'm... I've been waiting for a refill for five minutes. There you go. So, anyways, I called her. She never called me back. Excuse me? Refill. Oh, great! I need a refill too. Excuse me. Hi. Yeah. Can you do that for him? Over here. Yo! Agua. Is that all you're eating? My premiere's on Saturday. I have a very unforgiving dress to squeeze into, so this is pretty much my last non-juice meal. Is that healthy? No. By the way, you're gonna be my date. To your Hollywood movie premiere? Yeah, if we're seen on the red carpet together, um, it'll kill any last rumors about me and Vincent. So, I need to get a tuxedo, right? My people will sort that out for you. Are you sure? I have a cousin, Chucho. He owns a tuxedo-rental store. No insult to Chucho, uh, but let my people take care of you. But he can give me a good discount. And probably he will offer me the shoes for free. How committed are we to the mustache? You don't like it? No. No one does. Thanks again for lunch. Have you had sex with her? No, don't tell me if you had sex with her. - I don't wanna know. - Okay. Okay. You're having sex... You're having sex with her, you bastard. I know you're having sex with her. Tell me! - I don't know what you wanna hear. - I don't wanna hear anything. And what are you saying that's so funny? You've never once made me laugh. Not once. Maybe they could bring on a young female voice to help him. - Ms. Allan! - I'm not saying... What... - Hey. I replaced your filter. - Thank you. - You are good to go. - I'll take that. So, I was thinking, if it doesn't work out with the valet, and you want an upgrade, number's on the bill. Have a good night, ladies. It's working. Hey. Did you know about this? Yeah, the whole school knows. I had no idea Dad had this kind of game. He doesn't have game. He has, like, no game. He's, like, game-free. - He's, like, minus game. - Look, you'll always be my mom, but if she ends up being my second mom, I'd be kind of psyched. It's good for actors to be around other actors. I owe you a huge apology. I mean, I acted like a crazy person. Oh, no, no, no, do... Please, I'm just so sorry that you had to go through all of that. I mean, it must have been a real emotional roller coaster. You're sweet. I just love you so much. I love you so much. Listen, I gotta run, okay? But I'll see you when I get home, okay? - Kisses! - Kisses to you. - What do you got? - Looks legit, ma'am. Ms. Allan's even takin' the Mexican dude to her premiere. There's a lie here somewhere. Okay. Wow. You look very nice. Thank you. It just took a team of people 12 hours to assemble me. This is good. This will work. Of course I'm lying down. It's to avoid wrinkles. Yeah. How are the early reviews? No, don't tell me. I don't wanna know. Unless they're really good. - They... - Don't tell me. Don't tell me. I don't wanna know. Unless they're really, really good. - Okay, so… - Shut your face. No, don't tell me. - Don't tell me. I don't wanna know. - Champagne? - Is that Antonio? Is he with you? - Yeah. Yeah, no. He's right here. - I worry about what he's gonna say. - It's my publicist. She's worried you're gonna say something stupid. Me too. I'm nervous. Very nervous. I'm sweating. Look. Oh, Jesus. Okay, well, can you talk to him and tell him to stop sweating? Hello. I'm Antonio. Just try not to say anything. They'll mostly be focused on Olivia. No, no, I don't wanna say anything. But if you have to, just say something like you're here to support Olivia on her big night. Here to support Olivia. Her big night. - Okay. - Oh, no. I am... I'm here... "I'm here" or "I am here"? I'm here to support Olivia on her big night. On her big... I'm here to support Olivia? In her big night? I'm here... I'm here to... Please, sign my photo! Olivia! Olivia! Olivia! Please, sign my photos! Right here, Olivia! We love you! - Olivia! - Olivia, right here! Right here, right here! Olivia, right here, right here! Right here, right here! This way. - Olivia, over here! - Olivia! - Antonio! - Shoulders back, core engaged and smile. Just look natural, like you're looking in the mirror. And this way. Hey! There's America's sweethearts. Labels out. I don't want an angry phone call later, Tony. Let's go. The vultures are waiting. Come on. Come on. One more shot. I'm told you are wearing Galvan. Oh, you look absolutely stunning. Thank you so much. And, Antonio, this is your first premiere, right? I mean, it's pretty exciting, right? I have no idea what either of you are saying. - Olivia. - Mm-hmm. New movie. New man. New company. - This is a big year for you. - Antonio. Thank you. Yeah, I mean, I'm... It's just such an honor to… Antonio! - …about an incredible woman. - Hey. …all started with my great-great-grandmother, who was really into aviation and airplanes. I really wanted to explore that… - Hi. - Olivia. Oh, thank you so much. We're gonna go and watch the movie now. I know you said you didn't want nothing, but I brought you some just in case. They were not charging for anything. I have a bad feeling, Meeley. There's something in the air that ain't right. Remember the Iowa State Fair when I saw my first aircraft? It was a rickety old flivver, and I was too scared to get on. But you took my hand, and we went on together. Be with me again today as I fly across the Pacific. You're aces, Mom. Hi. You look great. Let's go. Um, here's your table. Can I get you anything? Yeah, a giant pizza. I'm starving. I don't want any of this finger food. - Already ordered. - See? You're anticipating. Mm-hmm. Antonio, can I get you anything? I-I'm just here to support Olivia on her big night. Sweet. Where was that on the red carpet? I mean, he's not bad-looking, but what am I missing? Historically, the world's great lovers haven't been attractive men. Casanova was ugly. But in bed, he was a legend. Hmm. Well, we only have to stay for 20 minutes, and then we can… - Oh, my God. - What? - He's here… - Who's here? - …with Kathryn. - Who's Kathryn? - Vincent's wife. - Who's Vincent? - The married man. - What married man? - My boyfriend. - What boyfriend? I... This was all explained to you. Uh, th-th-there were many names. It was very confusing. - Mmm. Mmm. - Where are they? They're over by the bar, and she does not look depressed. Does she look depressed to you? Well, maybe, maybe her eyes look a little sad. - Yeah. Yeah. - Okay. - Oh, they're coming. - Okay, um… Um, sh-sh-should I do something? Should I hold your hand? Yeah, hold my hand. Hold my hand. Hold my hand. Don't do that. Just make... Kiss me... Make out with me. Get away from me. Just get away. - Hi. I'm Kathryn Royce. - Hi. - This is my husband, Vincent. - Hi. We've seen all of your movies. That's so nice. I have to tell you, though, I think that this one might just be my favorite. It's very empowering. Uh, honey, we shouldn't monopolize her. Come on. I just... I... I love this. The actress and the valet. I mean, we are dying to know how the two of you met. - Oh, well, I was driving in Beverly Hills… - In Beverly Hills. Ooh. - …and I got a flat tire. - Flat tire. Oh, no. Ugh. - This handsome man pulled up in a Ferrari. - Me. Yeah. Ferrari. And… - By the time he had the spare on… - Spare on. - …I was smitten. - Yeah. Mitten. She was very mitten. - That is so sweet. - You see that? - Look at that. Isn't that sweet? - Yes. Yeah, see? Love always finds its way. - Oh, he's such a romantic. - Mm-hmm. It was nice meeting you both. Take care. - Just out of curiosity… - Shit. …how long did it take for him to tell you that he was just parking the car? - I'm just here... - Excuse me. I'm so sorry. I really need to steal these two. No, you know what? He told me right away, and thank God, because I can't stand men who have showy cars. Ah, you would hate Vincent then. He has an entire garage just full of 'em. Okay. - Uh, we really have to go, so, um... - Yeah. Yeah. I'm just here to support Olivia on her big night. Uh-huh. Right this way. So sorry. - Hey. Blast from the past, man. - Hey. What are you doing here? Ah, you know, man. Someone's screwing someone they're not supposed to. You? Same. Homo sapiens, bro. We're flawed creatures. Hey, extra falafel. You want one? Is that Falafel King? Is it Falafel King? - Hell yeah. - Come on, bro. Come on, bro. Oh, you know what? I forgot the napkins. You still, uh, keep an extra stash in the glove compartment? I have upgraded to moist towelettes. Love that. - Perfect. Thanks, man. - It's the best in the city. - They do not skimp on the tahini. - Don't skimp on the tahini. Oh, time flies. Gotta go. Oh. Thanks. - Where are my pills? - It's in your hand. Oh. My apologies. I thought this was the men's room. She knows. All right. Okay. Uh, I'm sorry. Look, Kathryn got the tickets. She sprung them on me at the last minute. I'm in hell here. I should wait outside for this. She's nothing like you described. She's elegant. Regal. - Why would you divorce someone like that? - Why? Because I'm in love with you. Because nothing I've ever done or said or felt makes any sense without you. There's a level of intimacy here that's getting very uncomfortable for me, so I'm just... I had this whole narrative in my head about how awful she was to justify my behavior. But now I find out… She's great at a cocktail party. Okay? But she's a monster at home. We're so close. We're so close, Olivia. She's totally buying all of this. It's gonna be me and you. I can't handle this. You were incredible in the movie. I know. I hate this job. Fuck. Thanks, bro. Whatever my husband is paying you, I'll double it. Fine. I'll quadruple it. - I-I don't know what you're talking about. - I'll give you $100,000. Cash. There is no way that Olivia Allan is wasting her time with a valet. Ma'am, I don't get paid a lot, so I would love to take your money. But I won't. It's probably hard to believe, but maybe Olivia is not as superficial as you. And maybe… Maybe you're underestimating the passion and charisma of a Latin man. Buenas noches, señora. Are you okay? Hello. I had one too many happy pills. Five too many champagnes. I wanna go home. Okay. I will call the limo. No! No drunk Olivia photos. Women's stories. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Look. It's the valet guy. Excuse me. Excuse me. Antonio, Antonio, I love you. I love you. I'm famous too. Hey. Olivia, we need your address. Wake up. Hey, Olivia. I need me an Olivia Allan shot. It's good for the resume. She's gotta be coming out soon. Two eggs and cheese and an English muffin. And some hash browns and… Okay. Okay. Um… Okay. Hey! Uh, O-O-Olivia, uh, these are my friends, Javy and Rudy. - Hey. - Rudy. - Yeah. Yeah. - Rudy's a cutie. - Me? - You're a cutie. - We need to know your addr... - You should go home with my assistant. - Her name is Amanda. She's very beautiful. - You... We need your address. We need to know where you live, so... - No, no. No, no, no. Don't. Wait. - Anything else? We need your address! Olivia. - And a Snackin' Bacon… - Olivia, your address, please. …and one cappuccino. That's it. - Your total is... - And as much ketchup as you can give us! The ketchup's for my friend. Yes. How much? Uh, your total is $39. Sleep. Oh, oh! Okay, um… - Sleep time. - Uh, wait. Dress can come off. No, no, no, no! The-The dress stays on. You sleep in your clothes. - No, no. No. No, no. - Take it off. No, no, no, no, no. Okay. Yeah, all good. Junior Mints? No. No. Oh, God, no. Oh, God. Good morning. Hello. I-I-I just want you to know that nothing happened. I-I didn't even look. And I slept in my pants. See? Okay. Thanks for, um, taking care of me last night. You would've done the same for me. Well, I doubt it, but, I mean, sure, okay. What's your... What's your address so I can tell my assistant? It's 1122 Valencia. Oh, South Valencia. South Valencia. Because if you go to North Valencia, it's a batting cage. And is there a coffee place near here? Oh, no. I-I can make you a cup of coffee. Oh, thank you. Do you have almond milk? No. Uh, okay. I do have aspirin. Oh! Yes. Yes. Yes. All the aspirin in the world, please. And I'm gonna clean this face because, well, it's obvious. Sorry. Sorry about this. I'm really sorry. This is Clara, my sister. - Hi. - And you know Benny. And my nephews, Luca and Dante. My landlord, Mr. Kim. - Hi. - Hi. And, I'm assuming, his family? - Picture? - I wasn't gonna ask, but if you're gonna do that, I want a picture too. Later. My tía Christina. My tía Tere. My tía Zenaida. - Hi. - And Chucho and his girlfriend. - Oh, Chucho. Nice. - And these people, I've never seen before in my life. It's such a pleasure to meet all of you all at once. I'm gonna make you a plate. Oh, you know, I'm just heading off, and… You're heading to this chair. You're gonna eat with us. Here you go. - Coffee? - Thank you. - La suegra's chilaquiles. - Oh, wow! Although I prefer a little to stones on the side like we do in Puerto Rico. - But these are amazing. - Uh... Uh, um… Well, I-I don't know. - Here you go. - Oh, there's more. Is that enough huevo revuelto for you? That's enough for a whole month. Wasn't joking. Okay. Okay. - Mm-hmm. - Eh? - Yay! Gorgeous. - Oh, my God! - It's really good. - She loves it! Ooh! What's the occasion? Oh, it... it's Sunday. Oh! Huh. I don't spend that much time with my family under one roof. Oh, not us. There's something in our DNA. Kinda like having one of those shock collars they use to train dogs. You know, like, we stray too far from home and then… Let the woman breathe. - Jesus Christ. - Okay. So, we're so excited about your movie. We've been reading about it everywhere. Oh, wow. Well, please don't tell me what you've read. I don't really like reading reviews. You know, it messes with my head. Tell me about it, yeah. - I got a bad one on Yelp once. - Oh, no. Still keeps me up at night. "Left the car smelling like a Russian bowling league." What's that even supposed to mean? I don't know. Um, but what I do know is that this is very good, and I would like some more. I'll get you right now. No… - Hey. - Dad. Thought I didn't have Marco until next weekend. Yeah, he just forgot his math book again. - Hi. - Hi, I'm Marco. Hi. I'm Olivia. Nice to meet you. Sorry. I-I-I didn't know you had company. - Uh, no. - Just tell Marco I'll be in the car. - I've seen the trailers. - Oh, thank you. So nice. Oh, really? - Yeah. I'm in the school play. - Oh, wow. Okay. You okay? Hi. - Was that your ex or something? - Mmm. We're separated. I-I-I have been trying to get her back, but now that she saw me with you, I ruined everything. She will never come back. You don't know that. I look like a playboy. Well, who broke up with who? She broke up with me. Yeah, you definitely didn't ruin anything. Isabel. She needs me to sign some field-trip form. I guarantee you there's no "field-trip form." Hey. I mean, I just... I feel a little blindsided here. I mean, I told you about Ronnie, and that's not even that serious. Uh, don't you need me to sign something? No. I mean, I-I-I'm happy for you. You're moving on. - No, no, but... - Which is great. - It's not what you think. - I guess I was the one that said we should be dating other people, so, you know, I'm glad that you're dating. No, no, but listen... Do you love her? No, forget it. Look, hey, listen. Are you going to the Oscars? You know what? I don't need to know. It's good. - Okay. - Just, um, tell Marco to hurry up, okay? Yeah. Yeah, I will. Are you okay? Great. - So we're doing A Midsummer Night's Dream. - Oh, wow. Yeah. I think it'd be awesome if you wanted to come. I'm Lysander. One of the lovers. That's a great role. Hijo, she's not going to a high school play of Shakespeare. - Unabridged. - No one asked you, cerdito. Thought she should have the whole information. I mean, it's two and half hours, not counting intermission. - It's Shakespeare. It... - It's long, is what it is, papi. Come on, your mom is waiting for you. Come on. Okay. All right. Bye, everybody. And fingers crossed, we both have big openings this weekend. Ay, qué lindo. - Bye, guys. - Bye, mijo. - That's my assistant, I should probably... - You know what that means? Leftover time. - I need to make you a care package. - Please, I've had more than enough. - Mmm. - Oh! Heat the Mexican stuff in the microwave, okay? I don't know what to do with the Korean stuff. One, two... Say "Kimchi!" Kimchi! Okay. Okay, that's enough. No, no, no, no. No. Enough. No, guys. No more. No more. - Come on, guys. Now, let's go inside. - Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Thank you. Sorry again. There's no word for "boundaries" in Spanish. Or Korean, apparently. I liked it. I don't see my family that much. - And you were right. - What? Isabel is jealous. Maybe we'll both get what we want out of this insanity. Sorry. Waze took me to some batting cage. Okay. All right, well… …I guess this is, uh, goodbye. Thank you. Thank you so much for helping me out. Yeah, I'm looking at 'em right now, ma'am. They're a couple. She really spent the night in the barrio? I don't think we use that word anymore, but yeah, they shacked up. I can't believe that bastard was actually telling the truth. Well, it happens sometimes. Not always, but sometimes. I'll send an invoice. Couldn't sleep last night, so I poured myself a scotch and did some soul-searching. And I asked myself, "What kind of man do I wanna be?" And I realized the answer to that question is "rich." I want to be a rich and powerful man. - I admire your honesty. - And what was I thinking, juggling two women at a premiere like I'm Leonardo DiCaprio? You know, when I was in business school, I had one dream, and that was to become the CEO of a vast real estate empire. Now, why would I risk all that for what might likely be a passing fancy? I mean, sure, Olivia's intoxicating now, but who knows how I'll feel in a few months? Besides, I adore my wife. I mean, why wouldn't I? She's the whole package. It's Kapoor. Hello. Hello, guys? Kapoor, what do you got? Stegman is officially out of work. Okay, spectacular! Kathryn called the dogs off. Congratulations. You got away scot-free. Out of curiosity, um… What was the turning point? Well, I hate to tell you, boss, but she spent the night. I see, uh… She slept with him. Vincent, the important thing is that your empire and your marriage are still intact. No one asked you. Kapoor, listen to me. Hire another detective. I want someone following her day and night. I want someone following him day and night. Full saturation coverage. …to relax you further and further. Let your shoulders drop. Relax your arms. Feel your body begin to relax as you envision yourself letting go. This is depressing. I heard you might be looking for a job. Son of a bitch. You had me bugged. Yeah, I'm good at what I do. You want a paycheck or what? Okay. Are you some kind of sex god, Antonio? I'm not a sex god. When I was a kid, I had a dog that had a scent or gave off something that drove all the girl dogs crazy. Maybe… …maybe you got something like that. If things don't work out with Olivia, give me a call. Okay, that's it! You and me in the bathroom. I got to see it. Right now. They love my movie. Did you read the reviews? I thought you never read them. Course I read them. I'm not a crazy person. New York Times: " Earhart Soars." Variety: "A triumph." That's awesome, but right now I'm with my mom. - It's her birthday. - Oh! They love my movie! - How great were those reviews? - I know. I know. Oh, except for Elizabeth Pembrooke of the Chicago Sun-Times. I wonder how she'd feel hearing her sexuality seems forced. It was clearly a choice, Liz. Let's go drink too much. I wish. I'm on my way to Miami. My sister's getting married. Again. But I'm taking you for margaritas as soon as I get back. - Okay, have fun. - I'm so proud of you. Bye. Now, there's this woman. She owns a bike shop, and she's firing up all the natives. It's... I don't understand when "gentrification" became such a bad word. I mean, it's Soul Cycle. It's not the end of the world. It's... - I gotta take this. Sorry. Excuse me. - Okay. Yes, hello. How are you? I'm at home. Are you nuts? My movie's a big hit. I just got off the phone with my agent. There are three more bidders for the company. I mean, it's all happening. Everything we ever dreamed of. Where were you last night? - I... I just... I wanna see you. I wanna... - You heard me. Where were you? Hey. Everything okay? Oh, no. Yeah, it's Pico-Union stuff. It's gonna be the death of me. Well, we're gathering for dinner. - And I'm gonna be right there. Okay. - Okay. All right. I gotta go. I'll call you tomorrow, okay? Mm-hmm. They love my movie. Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood. And to speak troth, I hath forgot our way. We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good. And tarry for the comfort of the day. Be it so, Lysander, find you out a bed. For I, upon this bank, will rest my head. One turf shall serve as bed for us both. One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth. Nay, good Lysander. Do not lie so near. Take the sense, sweet, of my innocence. Love takes the meaning in love's conference. Hi. I mean that my heart unto yours is knit. - So that but one heart may become of it. - Thank you. - Two bosoms inter chained with an oath. - I hope it's okay that I came. - Marco is gonna be so happy. - So then two bosoms and a single troth. Hey. - By your side no bed room me deny. - Listen, the other night, I don't know if the offer is still good, but I am definitely be loving to meet your assistant. You know? And, by the way, she can call me anytime. - She can. - Oh. Yeah. Okay. Lie further off, in human modesty. Such separation, as may well be said, becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid. So far be distant, and good night, sweet friend. Thy love ne'er alter thy sweet life end. Amen. Amen, to that fair prayer, I say. Then, end my life when I end loyalty. Here is my bed. - And with half that wish… - The kid's an overacter. - …the wisher's eyes be press'd. - But the donkey's hilarious. I still can't believe you got up in front of so many people. - My son, I'm so proud. I'm so proud. - Thanks, Dad. - You know, it's just theater. - So proud of you. I thought it was good. Long, but good. What? It was long. Yeah, all right. Well, I gotta go give Mom equal time, so… All right. Bye, guys. ¡Ese es mi sobrino! - Okay, okay. - Hey, bravo! Hey, bravo! Bravo! - Hey. - Hey, Mom. Ronnie. - I gotta ask… - Mmm? - …what do you see in my brother? - Oh, the elephant in the room right there. That's a tough question. Um, what do you see in Benny? Don't remember. Can we just please change the subject? No, no. I wanna answer. Um… Well, he's very attractive. - Very handsome man. - Yeah, but I... Continue, please. But what makes your brother special is that he's decent and kind. And he's not pretending to be someone he's not, which is surprisingly hard to find. Yeah. We're a dying breed. My father would like to thank you for including us, and even though he didn't understand any of the words, he thought the production design was top-notch. Okay. He'd also like to tell Cecilia she looks especially beautiful tonight. Ooh! Um… She says that he… He... He looks very… handsome too. 아빠가 너무 잘생겼대. ¡A bailar! Everyone, get your butts out here! Let's dance! Let's go! - You're coming. Let's see what you got. - Oh! Oh, not a lot. - Come on. Yes, yes. - Oh, gosh. It's a lot less than you think. Let's do this. Wanna dance? Hmm. ¡Amá! You know what? I'm gonna need a tequila too. Hey. Natalie. - Hey. - What are you doing here? Couple of us were out canvassing today. Hey, we're having another demonstration tomorrow. Anything we can do before the council meeting. How is it looking? Uh, no good. That's why we're here. Tequila therapy. - I'm sorry. - Mmm. It's okay. You know what I'm gonna miss most? Oh, I got to go meet my friends. Divorced. Three times. - Wow. - The world's most expensive hat trick. I'll bet, man. Right now, I'm staying out of my brother's place. You got your own room? No. He's going through a divorce too. But his seven-year-old's got a trundle. So you sleep in a seven-year-old's trundle? It's not terrible. It is for the seven-year-old. Okay. What about Ronnie? Ronnie's an idiot. How serious are you and Olivia? - Do I stand a chance? - Yes. Yes, very much. Really? I mean, you would leave a famous actress for me? I'm not supposed to tell anyone, but… we're not really dating. Wait. What? Yes, it's all pretend. Olivia's having an affair with some billionaire. Wait, wait, so you're not a couple? No. No, I mean, the whole thing's made up, so no one finds out. You were never a couple? No. The guy's lawyer shows up and offers me money. And then, the guy's wife offers me even more money. What... How much money? - $100,000. - Wait, you got $100,000? No, no, no, no. I already gave my word to the other guy. - But. - But here's the best part. - Isabel! - I was gonna surprise... Isabel! Shit. That's Ronnie. I gotta go. I'll call you later. Okay. - Okay. Bye. Bye. Bye. - Okay. Okay. Okay. Venga, cuñado, siéntate. Hey, I'm gonna walk Sofia home. Mom knows. Don't... Don't be weird. Check out the old folks. I can't remember the last time I danced with your sister like that. Your cousin's wedding, 2004. - Under duress. - Ay, ya. So listen, I'm putting in a bid to take over the parking at Vine Street Grill. How many restaurants is that? Four? Yeah. Mmm. What a big shot. Not breaking out the good scotch just yet. Still haggling over some garage fees. But if it works out, um… I thought you could be my guy on the ground. Create some kind of management position. You want to promote me? Hey. Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. I should probably get going. Do you mind walking me to my car? Oh, yeah, yeah. Let's go. Okay. All right. I'm really getting sick of these guys. Wanna mess with these guys? Yes. Yes, I really do. Come on. Hop on. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, we're up. Hey, we're up! - We're up! - Let's go. Let's go get 'em. Stay close. Hey. Stay close. Stay close. Wait. Not too close. Not too close. Not too close. - Okay, now. Turn and wave. - Okay. Get closer. Get closer. - Hold on! - Okay. Cut it. Cut it. Vete a la fregada. Here you go. Cut it good. Okay, wait. Go the other way and cut it this way. Now cut it... Now cut it left. Here you go. Cut it left. No, you wanna cut it left. When you're backing up, you wanna cut it the other way. What does that mean? - Just a fancy way to say, "Screw you." - ¡Vete a la fregada! Hey, cut it. You know, I've lived in Los Angeles since I was 16, and I've never been here. It's beautiful. Yeah. Yeah. Just don't go on the other side of the lake. That's where the junkies are. Cool. No one recognizes me here. No, pues... No one expects to see a famous actress in MacArthur Park. You got the night off. It's kind of nice being invisible. Huh. - Guess what? - What? Isabel wants me back. I'm not gonna say I told you so. But… I told you… So. I like this neighborhood. - Yeah. It's great, right? - Mm-hmm. But it's gonna change. Some developer bought, like, three blocks. Pretty soon, no one's gonna be able to afford the rent. Hmm. Clara was only nine, and I had to help out, so… You know, I started bus sing tables and working construction. - Those guys you see outside Home Depot? - Yeah. That was me. Feel like I should've paid for the pizza. When... When I finally got a steady job as a valet… I thought I was doing pretty good. And I was saving to help Clara go to college. She's a school principal now. She must be so grateful. Well, if she is… …she keeps it to herself. Oh, this is you, right? Yep, that's me. Yeah. Um… You know, I, um… I don't really feel like being alone tonight. Is it okay if I stay at your apartment? Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah. Thank you. Cool. But you get the chair this time. Yeah. That's... That's fair. Yeah. You know I'm gonna insist you take the bed. I was really counting on it. No, seriously. You take the chair. ¡Amá! - Hi, Mrs. Flores. - Amá. The detectives are watching us from that apartment. What? Damn it. I'll close them in the bedroom too. No. You know what? What? If Vincent wants to know what's going on… …in the bedroom, we're gonna show him what's going on in the bedroom. What's going on in the bedroom? Okay, what I don't understand is who put the spell on Lysander. Puck did. But it doesn't matter. I think what Shakespeare's trying to say is we can't help ourselves. We fall in love with the wrong people. - Oh, boy. - What? - Client ain't gonna like this. - Put it on. - Oh, wow. - Okay. Here we go. - Perfect. - Wow. Oh, wow. I would say that's... That's evidence right there, isn't it? - Okay. You okay? Okay. - Yeah. That's my shoe. It's okay. Now I'm gonna push you. Okay. Okay. All right. Now I'm gonna sensually climb you. Wow. She is wild. And now we writhe. And now we writhe. And now... Oh, yeah, we're gonna get in the hair now. Gonna get in the hair. Oh, we're surfing. We're surfing some waves. - There's some waves of ecstasy. Oh, yeah. - I'm starting to feel uncomfortable. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Okay. I don't really need you anymore. You can just... You can just slip out. You're under the frame. - I can leave? - Yeah, just stay under the windowsill. - Just slither down. - Okay. Just stay under the windowsill. Oh, no. The one-woman show. Ooh, kinky. What a lucky guy. God, she's doing all the work. Antonio! Oh, Antonio! What? I'm acting. Okay. Okay. I'm a gazelle. I'm a little gazelle. What does this guy have that I don't have? Her. You're the man! Oh, yes, yes! That is how you have sex with someone! You know what to do. - ¡Amá! - Oh, Antonio! Oh, yeah, this is the best by far! That's it! That's it! Ay, papi! I still don't really understand why are you two doing all this. A lot of reasons. I can't think of them right now, but… There were some. Are you okay? I don't want you to think, you know, I'm some… Ungrateful, poor little movie star. I don't think that. I have one of the most recognizable faces in the world. I don't ever really feel… Seen. I've convinced myself I have this perfect life that everyone thinks I have, but I have never had a healthy long-term relationship. All my friends are people I pay. I don't see my family ever. I had Thanksgiving with my assistant. And Vince is never gonna leave his wife. He would be crazy not to. You're a good guy. Why can't I fall in love with someone like you? I'm taken. Yeah, that's my type. Hey, where are you going? Stay. - Sure? - Yeah. Okay. Here. You wanna hear something funny? - Yeah. - It's really embarrassing. My real name isn't Olivia Allan. It's Betsy Shevchuk. That's a terrible name. It's good you changed it. I just made us 300 bucks. Tipped off the paparazzi. Ethically questionable, but tonight we're gonna eat like kings. Dude, I was gone for 20 minutes. I… Where are you going? I'm meeting Isabel. Go back to sleep. There's coffee above the fridge. Couldn't sleep last night. Me either. I was, you know, thinking and thinking. Uh… Look, this isn't easy for me, but, um… I thought about it. And I thought about it, and… This is never gonna be what I need. What are you saying? We met when we were really young. We're different people now. I think it's time we got the divorce. - But you kissed me last night. - I know. But then I couldn't stop thinking about all the money that you turned down. Antonio, you walk through life like you don't deserve much. How do you think that makes me feel? I wanna be with someone who feels like they deserve the best of everything. I'm sorry. Yeah. A work of art. It's a work of art. Truly. Bravo. It's excellent work. And it is just what Pico-Union needs. Incredible. Thank you. Ooh, uh… Excuse me. Is that Kapoor? - It's nothing you need to worry about. - Please don't treat me like a child. God, she's doing all the work. I see. Good to know. This is a woman. I think I'm more attractive in Spanish. Hey, how'd it go? Not great. What happened? Isabel wants a divorce. Wha... Why? She was only interested because I was with you. When she found out I wasn't, it was, "Adios, Antonio." Um, I'm sorry. Yeah. Me too. Did she give you any other reason? She doesn't want to be with a valet. She has bigger plans than me. Wha... She said that? She's been saying that for years in a certain way. Well, maybe she doesn't deserve you. I take ketchup packets from restaurants. Yeah, I'm a real catch. - I have a drawer full of soy sauce. - I don't wanna talk about her, okay? - Why don't you wanna talk? Let's talk. - Because I don't, okay? But you're a wonderful man. You should be with someone who appreciates you. How can you say that with a straight face? - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing. No, come on. You put it out there. What does that mean? You can have any man in the world, and you pick one that is married. Great. That's not fair. I didn't know he was married when I met him. Did you ever think that maybe... Maybe you don't want a relationship? Maybe you don't want anyone to really know you. - Okay, that's ridiculous. - You don't even talk to your own mother. I share a bathroom with mine. And she's not shy. Bye, Ma. How did this become about me? This was about you... You don't know anything about me. What are you talking about? I'm your friend. Oh, really? We're friends? - Of course. - Come on. You're gonna go back to your movie-star life, and I'm gonna go back to being invisible to you. That... That's not true. And by the way, being invisible is not fun. Do you have any idea what it's like to have people hand you their keys and not even look you in the eye? I'm not like that. Oh! So you're gonna call me, and we're gonna have lunch? I don't know. Maybe. I don't really do that with anyone. That's what I thought. That's what I thought. You took what you needed from me, and now you can leave. - Olivia, Olivia! Smile! - Look. Your real friends. Last chance to take pictures, guys. The actress and the valet, we're breaking up. It's over. - Antonio. - What? Forget it. Did you just end it with Antonio? - Quick chat! - Are you and Antonio over? Is Antonio with somebody else? Perfecto. Vincent. Vincent, stay calm. Vincent. Vincent! Vincent! Ow! I didn't hire you to sleep with my girlfriend! That hurt! Way more than I thought it would. Let's go. I'm not paying you a cent. Get... All right, all right. So, you never had sex with her? Nah. I hate seeing you hurt. But the world makes sense again. - Mr. Flores? - Paso. Oh. - Yes? - Do you have a minute? My employer can be a little volatile. But you kept your side of the bargain. $25,000? But that... that's much more than we agreed to. He won't notice. No, no, no. I can't accept this. You know, I grew up not too far from you. My father was the locker-room attendant at the California Club. In my job, I don't get too many opportunities to do the right thing. Hey, look at these two. They just had sex, and now he's making her eggs. I swear to God, I never had a relationship that good. Stegman, listen, um… You know, I've got this extra room. Two-bedroom place. It's on the jetty. And, you know, we could get you off your Sponge Bob trundle. If that's something… That an offer? No, I'm just... You know, I could use the company, you know? - And there's paddle tennis courts. - Oh, yeah. - I don't know what that is, but... - Yeah, we could get in shape. Yeah, hold each other accountable. We could... Yeah. If you know, if you... - Not that I don't... But if you wanna... - Dude. Yeah. - Yeah? - Come on, yeah. Roomies. All right. Oh, shit. 아, 이게 웬일이야! 이게 웬일이야 여기 누가 좀 도와줘, 여기 좀 도와줘 누가 여기 좀 빨리 도와줘. I'm going to speak in English because I want Mr. Kim to understand everything. 미스터 김이 다 알아들을 수 있도록 영어로 말해드릴게요. Cecilia Imelda Lopez, viuda de Flores, was born in El Remolino, Zacatecas. A village so small, it didn't appear on any maps. Mama was tough. She had to be. When she was young, she lost her parents, two uncles and a cousin, all in one terrible day. If you grow up poor in my country, you have to face a lot of hard times. A lot of violence. However, she always stayed positive. She had to start working in the fields to support herself. That's how she met my dad. They had me by the time she was 18. She had to work the entire pregnancy. Literally. I was born under an avocado tree. But she was happy because she got paid for the full day. Several years later, right before my sister was born, my dad tried to break up a fight between some workers… And he died from a knife wound. Mama had to start all over again. Mama saved every penny she could to send Clara and me to the States. I found out later, she never ate lunch at work to save that money. When we could, we brought her here, and that's how she met Mr. Kim. 그래, 결국 미국으로 왔어요. She knew you hated her pozole, but it meant so much to her that you lied about it. 너무 맛있게 잘 먹었어요 I don't know much about you or what brought you to this country, but my mother sent us here to have a better life. Maybe it was so she could meet you one day as well. 그렇게 만나러 온 지도 몰라요. Hyun-Woo, thank you. Thank you for bringing her so much happiness. 행복하게 만들어줘서 너무 고마워요. My mother didn't live the kind of life that was going to get her picture in a magazine. But she lived… She lived an extraordinary life. She was a force of nature. When... When she loved, she loved fully. When she hugged, she squeezed the life out of you. When she laughed, the ground shook. Goodbye, Mama. There he is. You spying on me? No, we're partners. But I do want receipts. Okay, okay, okay! Here you go, buddy. Pull up and the valets will park it for you. Okay. Thank you. It's okay, guys. I got this. No, that's absolutely not true, no. Well, no, I'm just doing what should have been done. - No. I don't know... - Cut! We got it. Let's move on. Great! Okay guys, come on. Ms. Allan, can I get you anything? - Yeah, I would love a coffee. - Okay. If that's not too much, thank you. Sorry, one sec. Good luck. Amanda just told me about your mom. I'm so sorry. Can we talk? Uh, so, you gonna talk, or… - Yeah, yeah. - Okay. Look, I'm probably the last person you need advice from, but I just couldn't watch you wait your turn with that cabrón. He will never see you for who you really are. Well, did you just come here to insult me more? - No, no, no, no. No. No, I... - I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm going to break up with him. - Yeah. - Really? Yeah. It's been far, far too long. I'm finally ready. You probably deserve a little credit for that. I should not have said those things. I didn't mean it. I'm really sorry. Well, they were true. Yeah, they were. That's why it hurt. I'm... I'm sorry too. Sorry. No. Vincent. You know, I just... - I wanna be in the right frame of mind… - Yeah. - …when I tell him. - Of course. You're a strong woman. You can do it, güera. You can do it. I've tried breaking up with him before, - and he always talks me out of it. - Ms. Allan. - We're ready for you. - Okay. - I gotta go. - Yeah, yeah. - Okay. - Go, go. Go ahead. Güera. If you get weak, just call me, okay? I'll remind you what an asshole he is. Hi. Why aren't you at the office? Just playing a little hooky. Why don't you go get your suit on and join me? All right. Your daiquiri's at low tide. I'll be right back. Hi, Vince. God, I've missed that hoodie. - Hey. - Hi, Vincent. It's me. The valet. What is going on here? I'm serving you divorce papers. No, no, no. I'm calling security. No, no, wait, wait, wait. Pérate. Before you do that, someone wants to talk with you. - Hello? - Hi, honey. Listen, I'm downstairs. Listening to everything. Okay. Okay. Well then, Kathryn, listen to me when I tell you that love conquers all, and it always will. And we will work through this. Oh, please. Also, I'm taking the company. Okay. You can't take the company. Uh, I built this empire from the ground up. No, my father built it. You just slapped your name on everything. Oh, and you're probably gonna wanna go ahead and call your lawyer because I did a little digging, and I discovered some of your very clever offshore holdings. As a member of the board, I had a fiduciary responsibility to inform the authorities. I hope that doesn't inconvenience you. Okay, Kathryn, um, you've got this all wrong. Olivia, she means nothing to me. She's just some insecure, vain actress that I wish... That I wish that I had never met. Yeah, you're on speaker, Vincent. Olivia, my love. Hello. Well, I finally did it. I finally did it. We are... We are free. And we can be together forever now. No strings attached. Love always finds its way, and we will work through this. Just you and me. That felt good! What... Are you speaking Spanish now? What? He brainwash you? Hey! Adiós, Vicente. What? Shit! I can't say how sorry I am for getting involved with… Him. I feel terrible. Listen, Vincent was still married to his first wife when I met him, so I knew what I was getting. Mr. Flores, thank you for everything. Is there anything I can do for you to show you my gratitude? Well, actually, there is. First it's a bike shop, then a little bakery. Next thing you know, gentrification has erased the heart and soul of our neighborhood! - Yeah. - Yes! A friend of mine said recently, - "You want bikes that don't go anywhere?" - Excuse me. I've just received notification the developers have changed their mind. They've decided to call off the project. It's not moving forward. What? Honey, we... We did it! Yeah! Kids. Come on. Ready? Come on. Junior Mint? Do you guys hate me? Now coming to you live from the scene where FBI agents have just taken Vincent Royce into custody for allegations of embezzlement. Police officials have yet to give a statement at this time, but we will… Okay, you're over-fluffing that. Do you not want them fluffy now? You said fluffy, so why don't you just make up your mind? - It's just too much. That's all. - No, it's just... - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - No, it's just... You're just... - Why are you so tense? - I'm sorry. I just want to have breakfast. - Why you so tense? - Let's just... I'm... Stop, stop! I need a bicycle for this wheel. Hmm. Something like that? I bought it off a junkie in the park. I figured you'd be back eventually. How? That's amazing. How much do I owe you? - Eight bucks. - Eight bucks? Yeah, he was an awful negotiator. Oh, hey. Did you hear? We get to stay. Yeah. Everybody does. Yeah. I was really happy about that. Yeah, no one knows why they changed their minds. Well, sometimes the good guys just win. Uh, if you just give me a couple of hours, I will have it up and running. Okay. Good. - Mm-hmm. - Okay. And then I thought, "Come on. Go back and ask her out." - So what happened? Did you go out? - I-I-It was a little weird. Oh, why? I haven't been on a date, like, in forever. - Right. - But it was just dinner. I mean, it's not like we're getting married. But then she invited me to see a band on Saturday, so I think it went okay. You're seeing a band. Did you kiss? A gentleman never tells. All right, so you kissed her. - Think what you want. - I think you kissed her. - I'm not saying anything. - I think you made out with her - until the sun came up, is what I think. - Hey, what? Hey, what are you doing? - That's my pickle. - I was eating a pickle, - is what I was doing. - Get your own pickle. That's mine. Excuse me. I just want a bite of a pickle. That's all I want. Well, if you want more pickles, order more pickles. I was saving it. What? No, I just want a little bite. I don't want a whole pickle. Okay, I think I'm gonna cut a small piece... Fine. We will order a whole plate of pickles. - Oh, yeah. Take it. Just take my pickle. - Excuse me. We need a plate of pickles. - I don't like pickles! - You don't like pickles? - Okay. So, why were you saving it? - I... Just because… - …save pickles. - Save pickles? Yeah. Hey, don't move. Olivia. Don't move. Olivia! Look this way.
