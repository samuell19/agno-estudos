Guys, uh, by chance have you seen Allegra? - [STAMMERS] Or a green light? - [NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE] - No? Ah, she's calling me. There she is. - [PHONE RINGING] No, it's not Allegra. It's the college. And I... I don't have the clip. And Allegra isn't here. Uh, uh. Relax. Hi, yes. [LAUGHS, INHALES] Félix, who is this? Yes. Uh... [CLICKS TONGUE] I'm doing the last touch-ups. I'm right here next to the main actress in the clip. Allegra, yes. Uh, no, no, the time is fine. You have no idea, I'm ahead of schedule. I can deliver it early if you want. [WHISPERS] No, what? What? What? Uh, uh, a Hollywood movie. Incredible special effects. It's going to be crazy. Yes, thanks for letting me know. Thanks. Bye. What am I going to do? Think, think, think. Without Allegra, there's no clip, with no clip, there's no college, no career, I won't be a director, no possibility of an Oscar, there's nothing at all. Relax, Félix. [EXHALES] Don't panic. Think, what would Steven Spielberg do? What would he do? Think like Spielberg. Think like Spielberg. You have to improvise. I have a camera and I have dancers. Uh, guys. Hi, yes. Uh, Allegra will be here in two minutes, she'll be here any minute. Uh, let's rehearse the choreography, yeah? I can't dance, but let's pretend that... Just once, okay, but let's pretend that I'm going to dance, okay? Uh, here is the camera. We're recording everything. There. Okay. All right, you guys guide me, yeah? - [POP MUSIC PLAYING] - How was it? It starts like this, no? Yes. - Something like that, this, that. - [AUDIENCE CHEERS] Dum, dum, over here, then there, and boom. Can there be a spin there? Like this. There. "Tru", ooh, ooh. There, like that. We could try some poses and something like... - Félix! - ...this, like you spin... [STAMMERS] Ay, uh, Alle... Oh, go, go. I'll call you in a minute. Yes, yes, go. - [STAMMERS] What's up? - I didn't know you could dance like that. - Me, dance? No, I don't dance. - You're incredible. - Where were you? What happened? - Sorry. - You should have been here an hour ago. - I know, Félix, I traveled to the past. - Again. - Yes, again. We were doing a general rehearsal for Freaky Friday and I was Ellie, but I told Cocó, "Stop everything, because I want Caterina to play Ellie now." - Okay, yeah. Uh... - Greta and Caterina auditioned - and it was a disaster, because they were... - Allegra. ...in the middle of the choreography and the bracelet turned on. - There's something... - A disaster. It turned on... - Stop. - ...in the middle of the dance. - Good thing I'm here. - Yes, good thing you got here! Good thing you got here. You should have been here an hour and fifteen minutes ago. - Yes. - And here you are. Do you remember that there was a clip that we needed to do? - Yes. - I don't know if you remember... - Sorry, Félix. - ...that I needed it to get into... - Félix! I'm here now. - [PANTS] Okay. - Let's make your clip amazing. - Okay. Félix, now that I saw you dance, and please don't panic... - What? - How about you dance, too? - No, no, no. - Please, Félix. - No way. - You just danced amazing. - No, I won't do it. - All right, dance with me. - Okay, yes. Dance with you? - [AUDIENCE] Yeah! - Yes. Together. - Dance... So, you and I dance together? - Yes. Of course. - So, uh... Okay, yes, all right. - Yeah? Great. - [FÉLIX] Yes, yes. - [AUDIENCE SHOUTS] - [ALLEGRA] I was thinking, and I think the girls should have red high heels - and something matching for the guys. - Something special. Mmm... - Canes. - Canes! - Yes. - I love that idea. - Okay. I'll turn on the camera. - All right. So... - Canes. - We would need the canes... - [BÁRBARA] How disrespectful. - [CATERINA] I'm tired. - I'm tired. - Me too. Laura quit! She ruined the rehearsal. Laura left. And now, she won't even show her face. Where did she go? It was a disaster, [SPEAKS ENGLISH] sweeties. [IN SPANISH] I don't know if you noticed, she threw us off in the choreography. - No one knew where to go. - Bárbara, you never know where to go. Well, something had to have happened to Laura for her to leave like that, no? Exactly. But now we know that Greta only cares about Greta. Anyway, I don't know why you care so much. Without Laura, you have less competition. - I don't have competition, all right? - Oh, okay. If anything, it's made Tomás, Cocó, and everyone realize who's the best in the company. Everyone listen up! [PANTS] This disaster also made Tomás decide not to spend a cent more on the tour. - What? - What? You heard right, [SPEAKS ENGLISH] sweeties. [IN SPANISH] We just lost our producer. - No, all right. - What do you mean we lost our producer? Ugh, that's all I know. Tomás just told me, okay? - Okay, but he's your dad, convince him. - What do you want me to do? Greta, Tomás is using Laura as an excuse, don't you get it? He wants Caterina to play Ellie and not you. It's obvious. - Can we stop arguing? One second, please. - Yes, this won't fix anything. Okay, let's think a little. Let's reflect, take a breath. I can't breathe! - [EXHALES] Everyone breathe. - [BÁRBARA PANTS] - Bárbara, come here. - [MARCO] Diego, the song. What? The song, let's show it to them. - What song? - The song! - The song, the song. - [CATERINA] What? Why don't we show them the song we wrote? That way we can break the tension, you could hear a pin drop in here, eh? All right.

My mom asked me to do a few things that I forgot about, and I had to leave urgently. - Sorry. - Relax, no worries. [MOCKING VOICE] No, no problem, Laura. No worries. [NORMAL VOICE] We only lost the producer for the tour. Isn't that enough, sweetie? [GRETA] Hmm. Bárbara, if it's so easy, why don't you call your dad and ask him to come back? [HUFFS] Ah. Otherwise, we better think of how to get a producer for our tour, no? I have an idea. [MOCKING VOICE] I have an idea. [CLEARS THROAT] What if we do a recital? LAURA ISN'T HERE But with the songs that are playing on the radio now. And, to give it a twist, we can act them out onstage. And... [STAMMERS] It will look like we're in a music video. Yeah, that would be great. And we can call the best producers in the country. - Of course. - Surely someone will want to produce it. - [ALLEGRA] Yes. - I love that idea, eh? [GASPS] I'm interested. I love to sing. [MARCO LAUGHS] Ah. Okay, I can think of some songs. Bárbara! What are you doing? - Should we go? - Yeah. I heard a great song on the radio the other day. - Me too. I'll show it to you. - Which one? Let's see. Speaking of great songs, remember the song I showed you the other day? The one you couldn't finish writing? The one I finished the day I met you.
