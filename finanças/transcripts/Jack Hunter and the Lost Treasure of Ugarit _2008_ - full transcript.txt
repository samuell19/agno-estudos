- Hello, baby. Camera. Return and receive. Oh, I hope I have a receipt for that? Come here. - No. - Nice catch. - Liz, it's me. Hey. - Yeah, tell him I got it. You're kidding? I'll be on the first plane back, believe me. See you then. Can't wait. What is taking so long? - Relax, my dear. - Albert Littman is a thief. I still don't understand why he hasn't been deported. - Nadia, patience will achieve more than force. - It's just frustrating, Ali. After all these years, I come home to find the same thing happening. Our history is being stolen from us, once again. My dear, it is your destiny to have returned home to do what is right. - Herr Littman, a vehicle is approaching. - Tell them to shut up. Ali, Ms Ramadan, what a pleasant surprise. What brings you all the way out here? - Since your quest to find a city buried under the Roman ruins of Palmyra has proven fruitless, your permit to conduct further excavations has been revoked. - I don't think you really want to do that. Your time in Syria is over. - My advice, pack your bags and get out of Syria while you still can. - Yeah. Finally, some good news. Berndt, we have a rat. One of the men must have talked. Seal it. - You cannot do it. They will all die! - Exactly. - No, I beg you, these are my men. They have families, oh! No, no, get out, get out. They are going to seal the stone now. Get out! - Herr Littman? - Let's go. There goes the rat. Berndt. The hyenas will have a feast tonight. - Ugarit was the home of one of the most prolific, powerful, and ancient civilizations on Earth. This Metropolis of incredible wealth and advance culture produced the first true alphabet. For many years Ugarit was the jewel of the Middle East. Its success was rivaled by no other. Professor? - Schaeffer, yes, Professor Schaeffer. - Yeah, what's that stuff coming out of that thing that the king's holding? - Oh yes, well, he's holding a staff in his hand. You see this and this, those two pieces, the iris and the eye compose the Star of Heaven, and when joined together, they supposedly formed some type of a weapon. Mythological rubbish, if you ask me. - So, the king could like melt people's faces off with that thing? - That's right. Liz. Yeah? - Where are you? - Here. - Hi. - Welcome back. - How is he? - The same, still obsessed with the treasure of Ugarit, and worried about you even though he won't say it. - But you aren't worried, right? - How was your trip? - The French have another reason to hate Americans. - But then in 1375 B.C., Ugarit suddenly, mysteriously, and completely disappeared. We believe the city was overrun and sacked by the Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep the 4th. No trace of the enormous wealth, cultural treasures or the Star of Heaven have ever been found in either Syria or Egypt. So, what happened? I believe that survivors of Amenhotep the 4th's raid were able to save some of the treasure and hide it from the Pharaoh. I also believe that the location of the treasure has been encoded in poems that were written at the time and left behind for us to find. Our own college is underwriting an archeological dig in Egypt under the supervision of Dr. Lina Halstrom. We believe that the bulk of the treasure of Ugarit is buried in Akhenaten's tomb. Jack? - Yeah, I have pizza delivery for Fast Freddie Schaeffer. - That's all for today. Read Akkerman's Archeology of Syria, chapter three to 10. Class dismissed. How'd the pictures turn out? - Great. - Atif Larousse had it all along. What about the markings? - It's a poem, Frederick. It's a religious poem about ll... Email the pictures to Ali. We need his input. I'm on my way. - Frederick listen, this is nothing. Frederick. Good to be back. - Ali. Yes, I know it's late in Damascus, but we got pictures. Ali wants to see what's on the tablet. Did you email him the pictures? - Nice to see you, too. - Sorry, good to see you, Jack. Now, where's the... Oh my god, you stole the tablet. - Stole is such an ugly word; appropriate, in the name of science. - I can't believe you brought the whole thing back. I told you just take a picture of it. Oh, never mind I don't want to know. I've spent most of my life searching for it, and now it's in my hands. Thank you, Jack. - You see these markings right here. They tell you how far in the passage you have to go back. They were tricky. - What an intriguing passage. Ilu's eye fell upon them, a light of heaven descended. Now that was a common way to describe a meteor shower. Then his glory was hidden in the gaping mouths beneath the fiery gaze of El Shaddi's empty eyes until his name is remembered, once more. - Yeah, makes complete and perfect sense. - Jack, be serious. - It's a poem, Frederick. It doesn't point to anything. It's just ancient folklore, mumbo jumbo. - It's much more than that. - Frederick, how many of these have we seen? How many of them are there? Maybe one in a thousand turns out to be something. This, this, this isn't it. - These illusions may be geographical markers to the location of the treasure. - If you say so. I'm exhausted I'm gonna go, okay. - Now we leave tomorrow, and make sure you bring everything this time. - I'm sorry, what? - Syria, we leave for Syria at once. - No, no, Frederick, I'm not going to Syria. You can go to Syria. This is your life. I've got my life. I've got things to do. - Yes, I know of those things. - Don't start that again. I did what you asked. I've got a flight to catch. I leave for Florida tomorrow morning. - I can't believe you're not the least bit curious to see where this goes. We found a clue! - I'm curious, but I don't have time to go traipsing around the desert because I'm curious about some poem. - This is the real deal, Jack! - Frederick, I want to find the treasure as much a you do, believe me. - It's located in these phrases. I'm sure of it. We just need to solve the riddle. Jack, you're the only man on Earth who knows the Ugarit language better than me. If we decipher the map, we find the treasure, and return it to its rightful owners, the people of Syria. - It's not a map. It's not a map! - I know this is not as easy as hunting for your Spanish galleon in Florida, but our work is more important to humanity than you lining your pockets with money! Haven't you leaned anything from the past? - Excuse me, professor. Sorry to interrupt, but it's late, and if you don't mind, I'd like to go home. - Yes my dear, go home. Tomorrow we must prepare for my trip to Syria. Jack, would you mind walking me home? - Yeah, sure. I was just leaving anyway. - We're closer than ever, Jack. Please. Come with me. - So, thanks for doing this. You know, the two of you care about each other so much. When are you gonna stop fighting? - As soon as he stops trying to turn me into someone I'm not. - And who exactly is that? - I'm Jack Hunter. Walt, wait, wait. I can't do this. - No entanglements, no ties, selling relics to the highest bidder, moving on to the next adventure, that's who Jack Hunter is. - Look, I'm sorry, all right. - Frederick may be at the tail end of a life-long quest, the least you could do is help him see it through. - That's what this little walk home was all about, huh? We have a little talk. - You know, sometimes you could be a real ass. - Only some times. - You owe Frederick. - Yeah, I'll see you around, Liz. - That's it. Who are you? - Frederick, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. Oh, god, no. Frederick. Frederick. No, please god, no. Please, Frederick. 10-4148 Abby we have a 187 at the college here, copy? Copy 148 Abby. Let me get this straight you came in here and found him lying unconscious on the floor bleeding. - All right, I've got your visa, your tickets. I updated your software, and let's swap out your phone for this one. It's global access. - Liz, where are you guys getting the money for all this? - It's part of a research grant. Look, Jack, I don't know what to say. I can't imagine how hard this must be for you. What I said last night, I know he meant the world to you. You don't have to do this. - Yes, I do. - The police said it was a robbery. Why don't you just let them handle it? - The tablet's gone. The tablet's gone. There was only one other person who knew we had it. - Ali. - If he's willing to kill for it, then maybe it does hold some value. Either way, I'm starting with him. - Jack. Frederick would have wanted you to have this. - Thanks. I'm gonna need someone to keep me up to speed while I'm out there. You're the only one I trust. Enjoy your stay in Syria. Mr. Jack Hunter? - Yes. - Wonderful. I am Tariq Khaliff. The Ministry of Tourism sent me to assist you. - Ministry of Tourism. I thought you'd be with the Ministry of... - Of Archeology. Oh, yes, she is waiting over there. Her name is Nadia Ramadan. - Nadia. - The jeep is right out there. Let me have your claim checks. I will see to your luggage, and, this is my mobile phone, I am your man in Syria. Anything you need, day or night. Whenever you need me, Tariq never sleeps, whatever, whenever, wherever. - I got it, I got it thank you. - I'll get your bags. - Hi. I'm Jack Hunter. - I know who you are. I'm Nadia Ramadan. I work with Dr. Ali Sulliman at Ministry of Archeology. - Are you an American? - No, I was educated in the States, but I was born here in Syria. - Ah. - I worked with Professor Schaeffer the last time he was here. He spoke a great deal about you. He was a very good man. You have my deepest condolences. - Yes, he was, thank you, and where is, Ali? - He had some personal affairs to attend to. He'll meet us in Ras Shamra tomorrow. - Well, we'll see if I don't meet him before that, huh? - Let me tell you how this is going to go, Mr. Hunter. Ali asked me to assist you, but I'm doing so in protest, as I have little regard for who you are or what you do. Now, I will bring you to meet Ali tomorrow. Until then, you are not to leave my side. Should you try to evade me or remove any artifacts from my homeland, I will make one call and one call only to the Syrian armed forces. They will hunt you down and make sure that you never see the light of day again. Am I being clear? - Oh, it's crystal. Now let me tell you something. I'm here to complete work on behalf of Professor Frederick Schaeffer, and nobody's gonna get in the way of that work. I don't know who you are, and by the sound of it, I don't want to. So, the quicker you get me to Ali, the quicker you and I part ways. How's that for clarity? - I'm so glad we understand each other. - Oh, me too. - Welcome to Syria, Mr. Hunter. - Thank you. - What do you have in here? Will you be staying for a year? - I'm only staying as long as I need to conclude my business. - Well, you will love my country. - I'm not here for love. - I'm a good driver, don't worry. I like to worry. - I have made arrangements for an excellent hotel in Hamabh. It's on our way to Ras Shamra. You will be very pleased. - Tariq, could you take us to Souq al Hamadia, please? I believe Ali left something there for Mr. Hunter. - Souq al Hamadia, ooh, a wonderful place. My cousin Shariff has a shop there. It's a wonderful shop. We'll sit there and listen to some music, you like? Syrian music, Mr. Hunter? I have what you need. I have extra requests of Syrian music ever. - Does this music have to be on? - You see, it's beautiful. Mr. Hunter, beautiful. Everything you want you can find here. Aye, aye, aye, I think there is no place... - That'll be fine, that'll be fine. - I'll meet you back here in 20 minutes, okay for you? Bye, Mr. Hunter. - We're almost there, Mr. Hunter. - Jack, call me Jack. - Well, I'm sure you've been called many things, but Jack it is. Hakim, are you here? Nadia. Welcome. Good, thank you. - Hakim is a dear friend. - It is an honor to meet you, sir. - You as well. I believe Ali left something for me? - Please walit, I'll get it. - How you doing? - Syrians are very friendly people, you know. Relax. - I was so sorry to hear about Professor Schaeffer. He was a good and kind man. - He was thank you, thank you. Hey. Stay back. Not the first time I've had a knife pointed at me. Although, that one's a bit bigger. You got the scroll? - Yes. - Let's go. - Okay. This way. Through here. Back here. Out of the way. Walt, wait, wait. Now where? I think it's, uh? - Come on, up here, up the stairs. - Oh well. Let's go. Come on. Come on. This way? Come on, come on. This way, come on. Come on. We're gonna have to jump. - What. Jump. - Please forgive us. You look beautiful. This way, this way. Tariq, go! - Okay, okay. - Go now! - Wow, what happened back there? - Two men just tried to rob us. - No. - Yes. - Thieves. - What are you doing? - I'm calling the police. - Don't. - Why not? They can help us find out who those men were. - No, they're only gonna get in the way, and I don't have time for that. I wanna get to Ras Shamra right now. I wanna meet Al.. - Someone needs to inform the proper authorities. - They can be bought. - You're wrong. - Well, I'm not trusting anyone right now. - Well, that makes two of us. - Hah, now you're making some sense. - Well, you want to know what I think? No. - I think we all need to calm down. No need to get angry. Let's go to the hotel. Just drive. - Okay, okay Tariq drives. - So, does trouble follow you wherever you go? - You listen to me, sweetheart. Frederick was killed over that tablet. - What tablet? What was on it? - The one that we emailed the pictures of to Ali with the Ugaritic markings. He didn't show you? - No, he didn't show me. - Well, at the time I thought it was just some old poem. Frederick was convinced it was some sort of a map. Let me tell you something. I am gonna get to the bottom of this, that I promise you. Will you drive faster? - Tariq is driving. - Yes, it's active. Look, I have to go t's Jack on my cell. Liz, it's me. - Hi, Jack, how's everything? - Oh yes, just great. Syria's a wonderful place. I really hit the ground running. Listen, I stopped by Ali's shop. He wasn't there, but he left a scroll for me. I think it has some sort of ancient Ugaritic map on it. I'm gonna need the latest satellite imagery of Syria down to the square foot, too. I wanna try to compare these two. Can you send it to me? - Yeah, no problem. Hold on it should be coming through. Coming to you now. Well, let me know if there's anything else you need, okay? - Thanks, Liz, I'll keep you posted. Hi, just give me one second. I've gotta get dressed. Come on in. So, did the police find those guys? - The report has been filed. It's only a matter of time before they do. - It's a map. - I know it's a map. - Listen, you wanna grab a bite to eat? I've got a couple of things on the computer I'd like to show you. So, these are the pictures that I told you we emailed to Ali. - These symbols they're definitely Ugaritic. - Ali left us this note wrapped up in the scroll. I'm sorry I'm not able to give you this in person. The same markings that were in the pictures of the tablet that you sent me were also on this map that I recently discovered. I believe it could reveal the location of the treasure. I will meet you in Ras Shamra, and we can compare notes. I didn't know what to make of this at first, so I scanned the map into my laptop, and then I superimposed it with a recent 3D satellite image of what I think is the same area. - Jabal Zahar. This is all under water now. A dam was built in 1973. It's now Lake al-Assad. It doesn't make any sense. Why wouldn't Ali have realized that the treasure may be hidden under a lake? - Your boss has a lot of questions to answer. - What are you implying? - He was the only other person to know that Frederick had the tablet. - And. - And, now Frederick is dead. - I've known Ali my whole life, and he wouldn't kill anyone, not even you. - The man didn't show you the pictures that we emailed him. The photocopy of the scroll he gave me, clearly a fake. He didn't show up at the antique shop, and then we were attacked. If you were in my shoes, what would you be thinking? - You don't wanna know what I'm thinking. - Nadia Ramadan, you're exquisite as always. Enchante. Jack, Jack Hunter. - Hello, Albert. - Interesting to see you here. Though why am I not surprised. - You two know each other? Why am I not surprised? - Jack and I share the same philosophy about the business of antiquities. - Oh, I'm sure you do. - And you have an excellent guide in Ms. Ramadan. She's a vigilant protector of her country's treasures. She's, a true professional. So, what brings you to this part of the world, Jack? - I love the food. - Are you a scholar now as well, following in Frederick's footsteps? - Professor Schaeffer recently passed away. - No, no, he was killed. - Oh. This is terrible news. My deepest condolences, Jack, and now you're here to carry out his legacy? Well, I have to go, but I'm sure I'll be seeing you again, soon. Auf Wiedersehen. - I despise that man. Ali has risked his career trying to stop him, and we now believe that he's working for the Russian Mafia. Their money buys them connections at all levels of the government. - Well, the last time I checked, the Russian Mafia was only into three things, counterfeiting, drugs, and women. So, why would they be so concerned with Syrian antiquities all of a sudden? - I spent most of my life searching for it. And now it's in my hands. It's a poem, Frederick. It doesn't point to anything. It's ancient folklore, mumbo jumbo. - If we decipher the map, we will find the treasure. Frederick, this is your life. It's not mine, okay. I've got things to do. - Come with me, please. - Jack, are you okay? Jack, what's going on? What the hell happened in here? - Oh, you know, just your friendly turndown service. - What are you doing? - Ali's trying to make me think that this map is authentic. He wants me to think it's a real clue to the treasure. I'm not waiting until tomorrow. I wanna see him, now. - Jack, you're not making any sense. You think that Ali gave you a fake map, and now he's sending people after you to steal it? - Don't you get it why didn't he show you the email? Because if the treasure is real, he wants it all to himself. - In my country, we still value honor, loyalty and duty, above money. Ali exemplifies all of those qualities. When you meet him, you'll see that. - I keep hearing all about that. I've yet to see it. - Who are you calling? - Tariq. Get ready to go. - I'll pay, you pump. - Hello. - What's wrong? - What's happening? Nadia, why are you crying? - Ali is dead. - What? - Ali was in a car accident. His car went off the road and he died, instantly. I guess you don't have to worry about him now, huh? Damn you for saying what you did about him. Damn you. - I'm sorry. - He was a great man, a great man. A great man! - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - And you. - I'm sorry. It wasn't an accident. You hear me, it wasn't an accident. Ali, Frederick, they were both killed for the same reason, the treasure. Somebody thinks it's real. - Why are we going after it then? - We're not. I am going home. We're going back to Damascus. - No, we're not going back. I'm gonna find out who killed Frederick. Do you wanna know who killed Ali, do you? The only way to do that is to take a look at this and follow where it leads. - What is that? - It's a map. Frederick deciphered it from my translation of the tablet. It's incomplete, but it could tell us where to start. - This is the Bishiri Mountains. They're in the middle of the desert. There's nothing here, Jack. - Well, that seems like a pretty good place to hide a treasure, doesn't it? - First, we go to the Ministry, and we tell them what we know. - No, we can't we don't have enough evidence. Whoever did this will just cover it up, and then we'll never know. We'll never know. - Fine. Fine, we do this your way for now. I wish you'd never come here, Jack Hunter. - That makes two of us. You tired of driving. You want me to drive? - No, sir, this is what I do. This is why I'm here. Tariq never sleeps. - So much for, "This is why I'm here." "This is what I do." What the hell. Hold on. Who the hell are these guys? How should I know. - Come on. - Jack, watch out. - Hold on. I think we lost them. - I had the worst nightmare. We were being chased and... - What are you doing go back to the main road. - Did you not just see the people driving us off the road and shooting at us back there? - You had the same nightmare? - Jack. - Just let me think. Telephone poles. Maybe there's a road up there that connects back to the highway. Tariq, stay with the jeep. - Yes, yes, good idea. - Let's go up this way. It just keeps going. - This is a dead end. - Will you just let me look? - Why are American men so stubborn? - We're not stubborn; we're determined. - Oh yeah, you're determined all right. There's nothing there. You know what, you're making my life a living hell. - Nadia, get back in the jeep. - And gone around, like I said. - Nadia, get back in the jeep! - Do not raise your voice at me. - Tariq, start the jeep. - Start the jeep! Start the jeep, Tariq. Go. Get in, get in. Where are we going? - Just drive! Drive! - Okay, okay. - He says we're stuck. - Yeah, I got that. Go, get out. Tariq, I need my phone. Get my black bag out of the back. Okay. - Get down, get down. A phone? - You take, take. You know how to use this? - Do you? - I carry a gun, but I don't know how to use it. - Give me that. - I'll go get some help. - Wait! - Tariq! - Wait! Either these guys are blind or they're the worst shots I've ever seen. - I think they're warning us to stay away. - Yeah, it's working. - Lucky for you I was driving this way. - Yeah, lucky us. - Not very grateful considering I just saved your life. Going for a dive, in Lake al-Assad, maybe? - You are getting good at this. - It's been your men chasing us all along. - You killed Frederick. I'm gonna kill you. - Let's go some place more civilized and have a chat. Put them all in the truck. Come on let's go back to the trucks. - Where's Tariq? Get in the car. - If the scroll is fake, how the hell did he know where to find us? - There are only three people alive that knew about Bishirit Mountains. Me, you and Tariq. - Jack. - How else? Stop, it's too tight. - Well, I'm just not gonna sit here and wait for him to come back and kill us. - He's not gonna Kill us. He needs me to help him find the treasure. - Well, I would rather die than help him. - I wouldn't let him know that if I were you. - Jack. Tell me about the translation, Jack? Where's the treasure? What does the tablet say about it? - Go to hell. - Jack, you more than most people know what I'm capable of, so let's keep this civilized. I don't wanna hurt you or for that matter, her, but I will. Just tell me the location. Tell me! - Leave him alone. You're nothing but a thief and a murderer. - Nadia. - You're standing up for a man who has not the slightest respect for women of your class. That was a compliment, bitch. Jack, I could make this really worth your while, and I'm not talking about these measly amounts we made in the past. This payday could set you up for life. - Let her go, Albert, she doesn't know anything. - But you do, Jack, so why not cash out your winnings and save her life. Just tell me what I want to know. - No, Jack. - How much are we're talking? - What do you want? - Half, and her, and don't try to negotiate with me, you're in no position. I'm sure your clients would hate to see you not deliver on your promise, huh? Like Peru. - Deal. - Bishiri Mountain. - You're a bastard. - You better be telling the truth, Jack. - I wanna know two things first. How did you know Frederick had the tablet, and why are the Russians involved? - Jack, your phone calls are monitored. And as far as what my client wants, you really don't know, do you? Berndt. - I knew I should never have trusted you. - You're welcome, I just bought us some time. Now, let me think. I'm trying to get us out of here. From now on I will not leave your side for one stinking moment. Okay, okay, be quiet. - Come on. Come on. Go. We'll rest here until daybreak. - Okay. - You didn't call your wife in that gas station, did you? You called Littman, didn't you? - No, no Jack, please no. - How did he know we were in that pass then? Answer me now. - The only person who knew where we were heading was my wife. I did call her. I would not betray you. - Why did you come back then, so you could follow us? - Jack. - Came back to save her. - Stop it. - I came back to save her. I came back to save her. - What's wrong with you? Didn't you hear Lebanese been intercepting our calls. Did your IQ drop in the last thirty minutes? - You okay? Yeah. - Look, I believe you. - Thank you, thank you. Thank you. - Let's just try to make that ledge up there. Maybe we can find some help over the ridge. I don't think I can continue much longer in this heat. Just a little further. - Look, why don't you just go ahead and I'll catch up. - Now where's that stubborn woman I met just a couple of days ago? - You're the one who's stubborn, okay. I'm determined. - How determined? - Let's go, if Littman beats us there, I'll never forgive myself. - He won't. - Jack. - I got you. - Don't let me go. - Put your feet under. Pull my hand. - Come on. Come on a little bit farther. I got you. - Thanks. - No problem. - I need to know something, and I want the truth. What happened between you and Littman? - I met him at a convention right after I graduated from college. I mean, he was a legend at the time, and he comes up and he's talking to me. And he's telling me about the clients and the gigs, and money. And then he asked me to be a part of his team. I mean, I knew I didn't wanna be a teacher. I was looking for adventure. And it started out great. We were a really good team. He would find the clients. I would organize and execute the finds. But something changed he was taking bigger risks and people started getting hurt. I mean, I knew what was happening. I didn't do anything at the time. I just decided I was gonna move on. I've been on my own ever since. That's the way I like it. - How do I know that you're not doing this for the money? - I guess the same way you know Talrig's not working for Littman. - I Smell food, come on. Come on. See, there are people down there. Comet on. Water, water, please, please. - Here, drink. Here. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. - Easy, easy, not too fast, it's bad, bad. - No, it's good, it's good. - Now tell me, where did you come from? - Our car broke down in the desert. - You climbed over that mountain, in the middle of the day in this heat? Incredible. You are either very brave or very stupid. - Stubborn, actually. - Do you have a telephone here we could use? - I have a cellphone, but there is no service for a hundred kilometers. - Could you maybe take us to the nearest town? - It's getting late now, first thing in the morning. For tonight, you will be my guests, huh? - You're very kind, thank you. - Come, come, come. Eat, eat, more, more. - I'm stuffed, I couldn't eat another bite. - Well, I still have room for more. - Help yourself, Habibi. - This is wonderful. Thank you for your hospitality. You know, I've heard that Syria is famous for it. - This is how we live, my friend. - It's beautiful. It's magnificent. - Come, let me show you a place that is really beautiful, come. - I'll keep an eye over the food. - Wow. - This is just magnificent. - Kids I love to play with them, you know. That's what I live for. Sorry. - Beautiful people. I mean, a beautiful family. - Were you close with them? Your family, I mean? - My parents died when I was in college. - Must have been hard on you. - Drowned myself in drugs and alcohol. It was Frederick who saved me. I mean, he was the only one who reached out. Tricked me into taking one of his courses. That sly guy, he had a plan. One time he made me stay after class, and as soon as all the other students had left, he walked up to me and he got this close to me and he says to me, he says, "Young man", I have tolerated your self-indulgence long enough. "If you truly loved your parents," "you would honor them and live a great life, not destroy it." "Your parents didn't leave you, Jack." "They simply died." That's when Frederick became my family. He always stood by my side. He was always there and where was I when he needed me? - Jack. - What's this? - It's a game that children play. Called the Hyena's eyes. What is that? - The great Hyena hunts at night, and as the sun sets, the great Hyena looks with red eyes out toward the desert for the weak and the fearful. - That's a bit of a scary game for children, isn't it? - But there are worst things come out in the desert at night. The Hashashin. Now that sounds like a kid's game. - It is said, they guard the secrets of the desert from all intruders. Of course, some say that they are just stories to keep children away wandering out into the night path. But, the Hashashin are real, my friend. Isn't that right, you little monkeys? - Jack, Jack, look, look. Look, fiery eyes that's what my wife has when I've done something wrong. She is one mean woman when she does not get her way. - Beneath her fiery gaze. Damn it, Frederick was right. - Jack, what are you talking about? - The poem is a map. Frederick said the poem was a map. The poem says that the treasure is hidden beneath her fiery gaze. This is what Frederick saw. We got to get there before Littman does. Tonight when they go to sleep, we're gonna steal their van. - Jack, we're not taking this man's van and leaving him and his family in the middle of the desert. Let's sleep on it and we'll figure it out in the morning. - You asked for transport and I shall provide. A van and two horses. Yes. - So, we may take your van? Why didn't I think of that? - I'll take it into the nearest town and alert the authorities. - No, no, no, hold on, hold on. Tariq, you go take the van. You go alert the authorities. I need you with me, we'll take the horses. - As I say, you're all welcome to them. - You're very kind. - In case you get lost. It's always best to be prepared. Good luck. - Thank you. Hope you can keep up? - We'll see about that. - They moving. - Excellent. Let's roll, go. Come one, guys, get moving. Come on. - Where are they? This direction. They're on the hill. We're moving. - Looks too rocky up there for the horses. We're gonna have to go the rest on foot. Gaping mouths, empty eyes. Oh, no. - We got to move. Jack. All right, just a little bit further. I can't see anything. - There's got to be something close by. - Just hurry. - I think there's a cave right here. Go faster. - That came out of nowhere. - Yeah. - Hey, look at this. I've seen this in Ali's research. - Really? Well, then let's see where this goes. What are these hole for? Stay right there. - Okay. Jack. - Come on, let's go. - You're crazy. I'm not going in there. - Come on, I'm sure this is the worst of it, trust me. Give me your hand. - I can't see anything down here. Jack. - Animal symbols. This has to be it. - There seems to be a symbol for each tunnel. So which, one? Kem. - Lizard. - Watch your step there. Scorpion. - Snake. - Bull. Ilu, who is also called... The great Bull. - You were right, I think this is it. - Of course, I was right. Looks like it ends here. - I don't think so. I've seen these markings on the tablet. It's a code. - Can you break it? - I can sure as hell try. - Jack. - I didn't do anything. - Jack! - Until his name is remembered. - Until his name is remembered, once more. - What? - Spell ll... - Jack! A second. - Find the second one. - I got it! Jack, do you see it? Jack, hurry up. - Get down. - The Hashashin it's not a myth. They're real. - Come on. Follow me. I'm guessing that's the Iris. - That's what the Russians are after. Where are you going? - A closer look. - Jack. Jack. Jack. All. They're correct, I'm known. - Why? - I'm sorry to have deceived you, my child. - Not as sorry as I am. - I could not tell you. I am Hashashin, a descendant of the Ugarit people, entrusted to protect this precious gift sent to our people by the heavens. - Listen to me Littman and his men they are following us. They will be here any minute. That was just the Iris on the scepter. Where is the Eye? - With the help of a traitor, the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten stole the eye from the king of Ugarit. The Pharaoh Akhenaten destroyed our city in search of the Iris. Many Hashashin died protecting it. - So, the eye is still in Egypt. - Get down, get down! He will find nothing here but his own death. Keep them first. - You got to get out of here. - Not without you. - I'm gonna go for the Iris I'll be fine. I'll be right behind you, go, go. It's dead man! - I never trusted your virtuous act, Ali. Go find Hunter. - Don't move. Come here. I've got you right now. - Let go of me. - Hey. Littman. - Nadia. You'll never guess what I've found. - The Iris belongs to the people of Syria. - Finders keepers, Ms. Ramadan. If it truly meant something to your people, it would have been placed in a museum long ago. This is much bigger than you think, and far more complex for you ever to understand. So I'll keep it simple. Such a waste. Jack, do you wanna say goodbye to Nadia? Looking for me? - What do you think you're doing, Jack? You've nowhere to go. - Who says I'm going anywhere? Oops. - Jack, help! Help me! Jack! - Now, what were you saying, Jack? - Jack! - Nadia. Nadia. - Jack. Help me. - Jack. Great work. I will miss you, my friend. - Jack. - Come on. Ms. Nadia, come. - Ms. Nadia. Jack, come. Are you okay? Jack, man. Thanks Tariq. - Jack, I told you we'd meet again, my friend. See, I said I would come to your rescue. Day or night, Tariq is at your service, and I brought the army with me. - Where's Littman? - Did you see him come out? - Hi. - Hey. You're leaving aren't you? - Excuse me. Yeah, Liz? - Something's happening, I need you right away. - Liz, I'm in Damascus. - I know. I also know that Littman is in Cairo. He's going after the Eye of the Star. We can't let that happen. - Wait, wait a minute. How do you know where Littman is? - I can't talk to you about this on the phone, but I'm afraid I haven't been very honest with you. The most important thing right now is preventing Littman from getting the eye. You know the danger the world would be in if that happens. Now I'm sending someone to pick you up. Be ready in two hours. - We need to run a security check on this guy.
