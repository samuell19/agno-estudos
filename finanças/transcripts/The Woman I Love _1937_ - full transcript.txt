Excuse me, sir. Are you in the right seat? Of course I am. Well, I'll have to see your ticket. I told you so. One of these is for the balcony. - What of it? Well, one of you will have to move. - But why? We're comfortable. - Please, sir. I know you're only doing your duty but you should forget it. I'm staying where I am. Please be seated, Madame. - Thank you. Not very comfortable are you? Oh, I'm doing alright. Let me have a look at the program. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. It might be easier for us all if we just changed places. Oh no. Why. - I seem to be in your way. Not at all. Not in the least bit. You've missed a lot. Do you want me to tell you what happened before you came? The most unusual story. You see, that man there is in love with this girl and the girl's in love with .. [ Air-raid siren ] Ladies and gentlemen. We are obliged to stop the performance. German planes have been sighted two miles from Paris. Now you will all be safe in the cellar. Come quietly down the aisle. There are stairs under the orchestra pit and at the ends of the side aisles. Now please, don't all crowd into one aisle. Jean. Jean, don't go down there. Come with me through the subway. Put out the lights! Look out. Be careful. Are you alright? - Yes, thank you. Where are we? - From the look of it, we .. We might be in heaven. Actually it's the orchestra pit. Wasn't I on my way to the cellar? - Yes, but I hope you changed your mind. The crowd down there is more dangerous than a bomb. I'm afraid you are right. Are you on leave? No, I haven't been to the front yet. But it won't be long now. I'd like to shoot one of those big fellows down. Sometimes the big fellow shoots first. Are you in such a hurry? - You bet I am. I only hope it's not over before I get there. Would that be so terrible? To miss it all? It would have been terrible if I'd gone up yesterday instead of tomorrow. I'd have missed you. Funny. A little while ago, I was counting the hours to be off. Now I hate to think of leaving. Forgive me. But I mean it. "German planes to the north." "Citizens may leave air-raid shelters." "All clear .. all clear." Won't you take off your cape? - No thank you. Have you forgotten? Ten minutes. No more. It's a bargain. Champagne. It's been ages since I danced. The last time was .. I can't remember, it was so long ago. I hope you won't forget this time. I know I never will. Oh, yes you will. We've met tonight and tomorrow it will never have happened. I must go now. Not yet please. Don't go. Stay just a little while longer. No, no. I can't. - But why? Please don't ask me why. I can't. I must go. Alright. Waiter. I hope at least you'll let me take you home. No thank you. I live too far away. I don't mind. Wait. I'll get a taxi. Hey. Wait! Wait a minute. Where are you going? Why are you running away from me? We were having such a marvellous time. What did I do? Tell me, please. I like you better than .. Than any woman I've ever known. Is anything wrong about that? Don't go on. Please don't. This is where I live. - But .. Just now you said you lived far away. - Did I? Yes. You must have misunderstood. Goodbye, and .. Don't take tonight or me too seriously. But I do. We'll see each other again sometime. - Some time? Sometime may be too late. I'm going to the front tomorrow. I know it might sound stupid to you and perhaps you won't believe me but .. I mind leaving you .. terribly. Please, if you mean what you say .. Go away now. I'm sorry. Who's that? Who is it? Who are you looking for, madame? I'm sorry. I .. I made a mistake. I beg your pardon. I knew you couldn't let me go like that. Don't tell me. It doesn't matter. You're back. That's all that counts. You're trembling. Are you cold? Wait a minute. Why I am so happy, I could shout with joy. Don't be afraid. I won't. But I am so happy. Smile. Won't you? Smile. Just one little smile. I know how you hate writing, dear. Don't worry, mother. I'll write every day. What I am going to say now will sound foolish. Try to be careful. As careful as I can, mother. I know you want to be among the first, the bravest. But don't take unnecessary chances. I won't. I promise. Jean! Hurry up. I've got a seat in the car for you. Everything is all set. - Good, I'm coming. Excuse me, mother. I'd better have a look. You've got the best seat on this train. There was some luggage on it already. And a Colonel's coat. But I moved them to another seat. That's fine. You'll have me court-martialled before I even get to the front. George, go and keep mother company a minute. There is someone I want to see. - I bet it's a girl. Maybe it is. - Better go through the car. So mother won't see you. - Thanks, old boy. And make it fast. Denise. You did come. I knew you would. - I didn't want to, but .. Oh darling, you are always saying that. - I know. But I couldn't let you go without saying goodbye. All aboard. All aboard! You'll write to me? Yes, but I don't know .. - Darling, how absurd. Do you realize I don't even know your last name? Of course. Denise Laval. Address me care of General Delivery. I'm moving to the country in a few days. Wait a moment. I'll write mine down for you. Jean Herbillion. Escadrille 37. Ginchy. Thirty seven? What's wrong? Is it an unlucky number? No. No. I was just afraid for a second. - Darling, don't ever be afraid. I'll be back. Soon. All aboard! All aboard! Mother. All aboard! Goodbye, kid. - All aboard. All aboard. Take care of mother. - You bet I will. And don't forget my German helmet. And win the Croix-de-Guerre. Where are we? Dix-huit. - Dix-huit? Is this place taken? - No, sir. When's the next stop? - Soixante. Soixante already? - Yes. Just back from Paris? Been on leave? - More or less. You? No, not quite. Official business. Headquarters. Cigarette? Big guns, huh? Well, you should know. Going up for the first time? No. Not exactly? - Rejoining your squadron, eh? Yes, sir. I'm with the 37th at Ginchy. How long have you been with them? About a year. Really? And how much flying time have you done? Four or five hundred hours. Say, they must fly the pants off you in the 37th. Sure they do, but they're a fine outfit. Drop in on us when you have a chance. I will. Just as soon drive a horse and buggy as this old crate .. Or something else will fall apart under it. How is Eugene? They tried to scare him but they never raised a hair on his head. Well, the old reception committee was out in force. Congratulations. I see they left their calling-cards too. Let's count 'em. 1,2 ,3, 4. Five bottles you owe today Duprez. No, not true. Two of those are from my last flight. It seems to me I've heard that somewhere before. Go in and make out your report. I'm hungry. You came back just in time. The fog is coming in thick. Captain. Jean Herbillion reporting for duty sir. That's fine, only I'm not a captain. - Sorry .. Don't mention it. I'm grateful for the promotion. It's been a long time coming. Marbot. 1st Lieutenant and observer. - Glad to know you, sir. Hey, you. Take care of his stuff. Yes, sir. I surely will. I'll treat it as though it was my own. Where are you going? I don't know. - I thought as much. This is Mathieu. He is going to look after you. Take it up to his room, - Yes, sir. I surely will. What room? He'll take Ganion's old berth. - Ganion's? Yes, sir. I sure .. I surely will. Ganion? Killed last week. You're taking his place. Come along and meet the boys. What goes on? Why the celebration? Bertier is a father. - He just got a telegram. A ten pound boy. We fined him ten bottles. A bottle a pound. Well here's twenty more bottles for you. Lieutenant Herbillion reports for duty. Your first day, you're buying. You pay for drinks all around. The whole squadron drinks. - Come on, Chopin. A tune. Quiet, quiet! Stack 'em up, boys. - Right, I'll start this end. What will it be gentlemen? - Rum. Yes, sir. Rum for the gentleman. Meet Eugene, rabbit of rabbits. Mascot of the squadron. My name is Deschamps. I'll treat you to the good side of my face as it's your first day. Don't pay attention to him, he's proud of his scar. It improved his ugly mug. Now Bertier is different. He mustn't let anything harm this pretty face of his. A brandy for the daddy. You brought me luck today. - Thanks .. brandy. Hey Chopin, let's have some music. - Something with a little pep in it. Make it something snappy, Chopin. - You don't call that music, do you? Well, that's more like it, isn't it fellahs. How about a Picon? - A Scotch for me. Picon and whiskey. Champagne for me and I don't mean a half bottle. A big one. Champagne. - Champagne. This Duprez, the squadron clown. Short on brains but his heart is in the right place. Gentlemen, the Captain. That's our Captain. 22 enemy planes to his credit. At ease. Hi, Captain. My pilots working hard as usual. You're Herbillion, right? - Yes. - Glad to have you here. A Cognac. - Cognac. Sorry, sir .. - You'll like being with us. They are a great bunch of fellows. As for your Captain, well you will have to judge him for yourself. You're a lucky fellow to be working under him. That remark will cost you 3 bottles, Johnny. Read it to him. "Joining the Escadrille: 20 bottles." - "Each bullet hole in plane: 1 bottle." "Flattering a superior: 3 bottles." "Going on leave: 15 bottles." Yes, and I've added another. 10 bottles for boasting. Captain, I .. Who's been boasting? - You, Pouter. You Labon. You Duprez. In fact, I can't think of anyone who hasn't been. I fine the whole Escadrille 10 bottles apiece. Come, Herbillion. Lunch. Let me sit over here. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Alright. Eugene is here. Well, relax. The fog is rolling in like a blanket. No more flying today. I'm sorry to be late, Captain. - That's alright. Lieutenant, Maury. Lieutenant Herbillion. Just finishing my report. Never work too hard on an empty stomach. Our chief pain in the neck. That's him. - He comes from the infantry. What's learnt in the trenches don't help up there. He's only been here two weeks and he's already lost one observer. Ganion. He'll lose more before he's through. Come on, let's drink to Herbillion. Welcome to the Escadrille. Come on. Caruso, give us a song. Phone. Hello? Yes. Escadrille 37. Headquarters calling you, sir. Quiet, please. Hello. Yes? Thelis speaking. Yes, sir. What? But it's impossible. Why, it would be madness in this fog. Very well, sir. If that's your decision, I will go myself. Alright, sir. I don't think you realize the weather conditions here. Alright, sir. I'll call for volunteers. A lot they care if we crack up. What do those swivel-chair officers know about it? They're all the same at headquarters. All they know about flying is what they see out the window. The General wants us to reconnoitre now. Why don't he get himself pushed over in his car? Marbot, there is nothing we can do about it. You and I are forbidden to fly. Apparently we're too important to do a man's job. I need two volunteers. I'll take on the enemy today, tomorrow, any time. But I won't fight fog. I believe it is my turn, Captain. Are you trying to show me up, Maury? Only trying to do my duty. - Your duty, eh? When you've done your duty as often as I've done mine .. You will know it is no shame to be afraid. Fog did this to me and I'm afraid of it, see. Yes, I am afraid. I admit it. If you say you're not .. - I don't know what you talk about. I'll tell you, you smug, infantry pilot. - Shut up, Deschamps. Leave the room. As for you, Maury. Never mind. I need an observer. May I go, sir? No, my boy. I want an older hand. I'll do the hop if it's okay with you. Don't let him go, Captain. He's just become a father. Don't be a fool, Bertier. He's a jinx. - I'll go. May I, sir? Alright, Bertier. Go. If the fog is as bad as this over the line, you must come back. Right, sir. - Contact. - Contact. I don't envy those two up there. With a hand like this I think I'll pass. It's an hour since they left. Raise it 5. - I'll go 5. Herbillion. Any news? - No. - They ought to be back by now. They'll be lucky if they ever get back with that jinx piloting. Then why don't we do something? We sit playing cards .. What you want us to do? I don't know. Go out and look for them. Anything. You see how long they've been up in the fog? Take it easy, boys. Take it easy. Waiting is the hardest part of this job. Sometimes it's easier to be up there. Captain! They're coming. They're coming! Did they give you a party over there? Come on, Bertier. Steady on. Take him out, quick. - Yes, sir. Maury. - Yes, sir? Do you know you were fired at? I zigzagged as much as I could. Ground fire was awful. The motor stalled .. Alright. Put him on the stretcher. Make way, please. Easy now. Take off his helmet. Open his suit. Hello, Doc. Don't you worry about me. I'll be alright in a minute. Well, Doc? I don't know what to say, Captain. Make out your report. Can I get you something, sir? What? Perhaps a drink, sir? A drink? - It steadies the nerves, sir. There's a bottle of whiskey in your trunk. The one the British Colonel gave you. It's been there ever since you left. Shall I get it out? No, no. Just leave me alone. Yes, sir. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Excuse me coming in like this, Lieutenant. What do you want? Well, I .. I thought it might be hard for you to be alone and .. After what happened. - After what happened? What can I do in a fog? But twist and turn and pray. They say I am jinxed. Maybe they're right. - You mustn't say that. You mustn't even think like that. - What's the use of pretending. They make it clear enough. Even the Captain. You're wrong. - Don't bother to explain. I know men. I understand. - You're too sensitive. Maybe I am. Maybe I've got a right to be. I liked Bertier. I liked him as much as any of them. It was probably the happiest day of his life. And he had to die. That's right with me. I don't blame them for hating me. There are moments when I feel I can't go on like this. Moments when I don't want life. And death doesn't want me. You mustn't give up. There is too much else to live for. This isn't everything. It isn't the whole world. Of course. Of course! Isn't it crazy that a man can get like that? There are even bigger things. Bigger than the captain, bigger that the war. I forgot. Forgotten all about her. My wife. And she is everything. She is young. Beautiful. I can tell you something. It was really for her and .. My own vanity that I became a flyer. Look at me. This uniform. Now. Look at you. You look right. You look like a real aviator. - I'm sure you look the same to her. I hope so. But I am boring you. We mustn't only talk about me. - No, no. I can understand. You see. I love someone, too. I only met her a few hours before I left. But I feel I've known her always. Loved her always. Her name is Denise. That's a charming name. Let's drink to her. I very seldom drink you see. So, you say when. When. I've had this bottle a long time and I never thought I'd be so grateful for it. It's good to drink with a friend. - Your health. To mademoiselle .. Denise. To madame .. - Helene. During the past week, three men were lost and three new teams must be formed. There must be complete understanding 1between each pilot and his observer. Firstly, they must be more than friends. They must feel alike. Think alike. They must share the same experiences. And take the same hard knocks. That is what we call "Equipage". There are three observers unattached. One of you must go with Maury. He's as good a pilot as any of us. Who will make up his equipage? Mezziores? You've been here the longest. It's your choice. Michel? How can you expect anybody to go up with him? He's lost 2 observers already. - That will do, Marbot. [ Door knocks ] Come in. You need me, Captain? Yes, I'll see you in a moment. Just wait outside, will you. Certainly. If you'll allow me sir, I'll go with Maury. Are you sure? - Yes, sir. Then that will be all, gentlemen. Go and tell him, Herbillion. What happened? - Have a drink with me. We're going to celebrate. - Celebrate what? - Us. We are in Equipage, you and I. You asked for me? As your pilot? - If it's alright with you. More than right with me. The others didn't want me. No, that's alright. Don't say anything. They couldn't have done me a greater favor. You will be well taken care of. I promise you. Have a good time. You earned this leave. I wish you were coming with me, - I'd give a lot to. Being chief pilot has its drawbacks. I don't know when I'll get a leave. - Well, I'll be thinking of you. Take care of yourself. And watch out for those Paris taxi cabs. They are more dangerous than the enemy. And don't forget my letter, will you. - Of course not. Where did I put it? Here it is. Give it to her yourself. I am so anxious for you to meet her. I never have told you. Oh, haven't you? Eyes like stars and the figure of an angel. I promise tomorrow rain or shine, hot or cold I present myself to Madame Maury. [ Door knocks ] Sorry to interrupt Lieutenant. The car is waiting. Alright Mathieu. Coming. What can I bring you back? Well, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, maybe .. A blond. I'll try but you're hard to please. Goodbye. Goodbye. Say hello to Paris. Paris. George, I'm scared to face him without a medal. You tell him we'll do the best we can just to please him. - Alright. Don't forget the Eau de Cologne. - I won't. And a collar for Eugene. Get some music. Remember, Chopin's prelude. I won't. So long fellows. - So long, Jean. Don't forget my letter. You never wash at all out there? - What do you think we are, savages? Cut off the water. Well it was for my friend, Philippe. He's in the infantry. He only washes when he's on leave. - That's his tough luck. You know, it's too bad you're not at Verdun. Instead of that crazy Ginchy. - What's wrong with Ginchy? Nothing I guess, only nobody has ever heard of it. Take Verdun, there's a place you can talk about. The brother of my friend Philippe, he's at Verdun. You little fool. The battle of Verdun was fought over 6 months ago. Was it? - Sure. Ah, that's too bad. It's a pity you didn't get a medal. He got one. Who got what? What are you talking about? I'm always talking about the same man. What man? The brother of my friend, Philippe. If you don't shut up about the brother of your friend Philippe .. How long has he been at the front anyway? A year. - A year? Well, that's different. Just you wait and see what I bring back after a year. Because all joking aside. Maury and I are the best equipage in the squadron. I'll bet. If I was a little older, we could be an equipage. You and me. That would be great, wouldn't it. Great. Well, look at him. Go on, take that coat off. Jean. - Hmm? Where are you going? - That's none of your business. May I go with you? - No. Please. Alright. Provided of course you don't mention the brother of your friend, Philippe. Well, what are you waiting for? Nothing. Jean. - What? Aren't you going to put on your coat? - Why should I? Is it raining? Well no, but I thought .. I wish you would. - Why? Well .. Philippe and some other friends of mine are .. I just saw them outside. And I .. - And? I'd rather they didn't see that .. That you hadn't got a medal. Alright. It must be nearly 5 by now. 10 minutes to. - Is it? Why don't you take off? There is plenty of time. She's not even here yet. Is it the one who was at the station or another? Never you mind. Alright. Alright, don't get excited. But I understand about women. The brother of Philippe has a different one every day. For the last time, lay off the brother of your friend, Philippe. I will. I will. He doesn't mean anything in my life. Waiter. Waiter. I'll take another ice-cream. You know, the striped kind. Chocolate and vanilla. You'll do nothing of the sort. Alright, waiter. You are going. Going? - Yes, going. Mail these for me right away. Clear? Clear enough, Anything to get rid of me. Oh, pardon me. It's you! It's really you. I thought about you so much these weeks I'd almost forgot what you looked like. You're not disappointed, are you? Sorry Jean, but there is something I have to ask you. What, you again? Now don't be angry but I couldn't mail this one. It's got no address on it. Oh, I forgot. I have to take this one myself. Sorry, darling. These letters I promised to mail for pals at the front. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Jean's brother. George Herbillion. - How do you do. Waiter. - George. Alright. If you're going to take that attitude, I'm going. I just wanted to say that .. I'm going. - That's what we hoped. I like this caf?. And not only on account of the ice-cream. That's what my brother thinks. Because .. I like you, too. Thank you, George. And I like you. Goodbye then. He's impossible. - He's a darling. It's a letter from Maury to his wife. You know, Maury. I wrote you about him. I promised to see her and give it to her myself. I don't want to be away from you for a minute, darling. Claude is so crazy about her. He's such a grand guy. You wait until you meet him, Denise. Want some? What's the matter, darling? - Nothing. I don't understand. There's something the matter. You're so quiet all of a sudden. You're not having fun anymore. No really, darling. I'm enjoying every minute. I wish we could go on like this forever. Then you are happy, aren't you? - Happier than I've been in all my life. Then you must have no secret thoughts. You must tell me all you're thinking. Now. What are you thinking now? I .. I was just thinking of some new way to say I love you. Come here, I'll show you. Hold it, hold it! Just as you are. Bring me the camera, quick. Ah, what a couple. What a beautiful young couple. Love's young dream come true. Hold the pose for one minute. You should be able to. It ought to be easy for you. Listen. I will immortalise you. The prettiest picture you ever saw .. In all your lives. There you are. Now wait a minute, young man. Just put your left hand up a little bit higher. That hat, take it off. It casts a shadow over your beautiful features. That's it. Now, hold it. There we are. Now folks. Ah, beautiful. Lovely! Watch it! I guarantee madame, that you and your husband will be very pleased. There's no finer souvenir than a photograph. Now, just like that. Hold it still. Still! There we are! Here we go now. One, two, three. Who shall I say is calling? - A friend of Monsieur Maury. Very good, sir. Denise? Denise. It's impossible. Yes. I am Helene Maury. So that's why you never told me where you lived. Made me write you at the post office. Met me .. - Yes, Jean. That's why. - But how could you? You turned my love into a cheap intrigue. Hiding around corners. Lying to me. - Stop it! Do you think I haven't said to myself a thousand times all you say to me now? Remember when we first met? I wanted to get away from you. But you insisted. - I wish I hadn't. Don't try to hurt me, Jean. It hurts too much already. But you knew. I told you where I was going. Only at the last minute when you were leaving. Suddenly I saw you both. You and Claude .. facing death together. I couldn't make it worse. I couldn't tell you then. I thought I'd never see you again. - Then why did you? Because after you had gone. When your letters came. I realized what you meant to me. It may be weakness, madness or anything, but I knew I loved you and I can't stop. You had no right. Jean. Listen to me without hating me. Just for a minute. I didn't want to fall in love with you or anyone. I was happy with Claude. Or as happy as I knew how to be. I'd never been in love. Until after a while, I imagined I must be in love with him. I think I might have gone on imagining that if I hadn't met you. He was so good and kind. - As he is now. And I was proud of him. - You had every reason to be. And when the war came and he left me. I missed him. I was afraid something would happen to him because I loved him. Then what ..? You don't know what you say. - Yes, I do. I loved him but I was never in love with him. Can't you understand my love for you is different. It's strong, exciting and .. Frightening. But it doesn't touch my feeling for him. It's got nothing to do with it. I've heard men say women have no sense of honor. I guess it's true. Jean, how can you? Can't I make you understand? Your husband and I, we're closer than friends. We are closer than brothers. - I love you. And I'm not ashamed of it. Jean! Here comes Lieutenant Maury. He'll sure be glad you're back. He's been asking for news of you every day. Well, let's unpack your bags. Oh, this looks like Deschamps' perfume. Smells good. And a collar for Eugene. He'll feel like a police dog in this. Oh boy, look at those goggles. And Chopin's music. You've done a fine job, Lieutenant. I hope you had a nice time in Paris. You know, I was just figuring. I'm going to have to wait two more months. It's tough. Especially when I think of my wife. Not that I don't trust my wife but you never can tell. You know Lieutenant, it's not good leave a woman alone too long. They get to thinking and well .. A woman don't like to think alone. Jean. My friend, I am delighted. Forgive for not meeting you. I was just checking over the old ship. We've missed you. I'm glad you're back. Thanks. Well, how are you? Tell me all about yourself. Did you have a good time? Yes. Not bad. You look a little tired. - I'm not. I'm not at all. How was Helene? You saw her, of course? Yes. Tell me, how was she? I haven't heard lately. There is nothing wrong is there? What's the matter with you? Listen, Maury. There is something I've got to tell you. - She is ill? I knew it. Has something happened to her? It isn't serious, is it Jean? Jean, tell me the truth. Don't be absurd, Maury. Of course she's not ill. She's perfectly alright. At least, she seemed so the few moments I was with her. Yes. Go on. - And nothing. She's alright. That's all. Isn't that enough? - No, I want to hear everything. Did she ask about me? Of course. Naturally she asked about you. I told you, I only saw her for a few minutes. Did she have on that blue dress with the lace collar. You'll have to forgive me Maury, but I really didn't notice what she had on. Oh. I'm being selfish. Only thinking of myself. What about your friend? Mademoiselle Denise? How as she? Did you see a lot of her? Please Maury, I don't feel like answering all these questions. Can't you tell I want to be alone. I am sorry. Attention! Present .. arms! Citation by order of the Army. Lieutenants Maury and Herbillion. Success on numerous missions of various nature. On May 10 pursued by 4 German planes, fought them off. Completed the mission. Lieutenants Maury and Herbillion. By order of the Commanding General of the 4th Army. I award you the Croix de Guerre. Congratulations, gentlemen. Your squadron should be proud of you. I'm glad we earned them together. You wanted to see George? He's having his music lesson. Sit down, won't you. Can I tell him something for you? - No. Thank you very much. I'm afraid my coming here must seem rather strange to you. I am a friend of your son. Of Jean. I see. What was it you wanted to ask about Jean? He .. We were .. He used to write to me and .. And now. I haven't heard from him. I've had no news for .. ages. So I came to .. ask you. The last we heard, my son was quite well. I'm afraid the fact that he hasn't written to you is his business. Madame, please. You are his mother. You must understand what it would mean to have him .. To have him up there and not news of him. Please, Madame. Don't be unkind to me. Come, my dear. Don't upset yourself. You mustn't hold it against him that he hasn't written. He's always been bad about letters. Even to me. - I do know. Of course. But it just hurts so terribly. I know how one suffers. Boys of his age are so thoughtless. But for the moment, you can set your mind at ease. I had a letter from him this morning. Yes. "We are off Wednesday for 15 days furlough." "Our Captain is going on leave. Maury replaces him." And then he says: "I wish you would come and pay me a visit." He forgets that I have the little one in there. Where are they going? Chateauneuf in Champagne. Chateauneuf. In Champagne. That's all boys. I need a moment of relaxation too. Oh Florence, they don't make them like you anymore. Precisely. This little lady is still on fire. Hello baby, what's the matter? Something on your mind? - How about heading somewhere else? I am very happy right here where I am. Juliette, champagne. This is on the house, boys. Cheer up, baby. If your girl is not here I am glad to oblige. Kiss me. - So now you want to play? Do what I say. Kiss me. First you won't and then you will. Complicated, eh? Maybe that's why I like you. Hello Maury. Join us. Have a drink. Maury, this is the best part of the show. Florence. Hi there, sit down. You are all invited today. Hey you. Alright cupid, cut it. She's my girl. You understand? Stay where you are. Madam seems to prefer my knees to yours. Purely a matter of taste. - Let her alone, I said. The lady can makes her choice. I'll fix your face so your own mother wouldn't choose you. Hey, you. You started this. Go away. If you want to fight, why not go to the front? So that's what you want. Why you .. Now get out of here! It's alright. He won't fight. We're not through yet, you and me. - Now get out of here. Throw him out! Juliette, fix that table. Come on, Jean. Let's go home. - What are you talking about? I can take care of myself. Hey Florence, what about that drink? Come on, let's have some music. You sent for me, sir? Jean. I am sorry but I'm in charge while the Captain is away. The police have filed a complaint about last night. So what? - Well. We'll try to fix it up of course, but .. Don't let it happen again. It's not like you to get so drunk. I wasn't drunk. You're not trying to make me believe that woman means anything to you? Why not? She's as good as any other. What's it got to do with you anyway? It's my affair. If you have to punish me, go ahead. Does a man have to answer to the squadron for his private life nowadays? Alright. You can go. Jean. I almost forgot to tell you. I received a wire from my wife. She is arriving tomorrow. Your wife coming here? Yes. She planned it herself as a sort of surprise. The Captain arranged it with headquarters. Well .. I'm very happy for you. Jean. What happened? What's come between us? I don't know. There is something about you that makes people resent you. You said so yourself. Boys, she's coming. She's coming! Come on fellahs. Get in your place. Come on fellahs, get in place. What goes on here? Why the excitement? - Don't ask stupid questions. Hurry up, get in line. That's the news. A lady is coming for lunch. Maury's wife. Maury paid for the champagne, fellahs. Maybe we had him wrong? Maury is a pretty decent guy after all. They're coming. Get ready. Attention! They couldn't have received you better if you'd been a General. Where is Herbillion? - Yes, where is Herbillion? You remember Helene? The young man who brought you my letter. Yes. What's the bet he's got a date with Florence? Has he fallen for her? - Why not? Wish she'd give me a tumble. It must have been some brawl there the other night. Herbillion was just about ready to kill the MP. I hear they called the police. - Ah, women love it. What? - Men that will fight for them. Sorry I'm late. Madame, welcome to the Escadrille. Duprez is my name. Hello everybody. Who is this Florence? Well I haven't seen her yet, but they say she is a cosy armful. Excuse me. A fine girl. The entertainer at the caf?. She's gone overboard for Herbillion. - Don't blame her. He's a handsome guy. You know, something is all wrong with Herbillion. What do you mean? Well I just seen him at Florence's. I stopped by there for a drink. And I asked him if he wasn't coming back for lunch and he almost bit my head off. Can you imagine anyone eating that slop at Florence's when they can have this? With Maury's champagne thrown in. - Maybe it's love. What's the matter, darling? You aren't eating anything. Yes .. yes, I am. Denise. - No-one saw me come in. Why did you come to Chateauneuf? You should have written to me. I couldn't. Even if you stopped loving me. You should have told me. Jean, don't go on torturing us both like this. We haven't done anything wrong. No-one can condemn us for loving each other. No. But Maury? If we could only tell him. How about now? - No, but someday. Because he is like he is. He will understand. If it could only be like that. Then you do still love me? I love you enough. But I try so hard not to. Sometimes I hate you. Sometimes I hate Maury. I'm only sure of one thing. That I despise myself. If you knew what it's like to have a man as your friend who's more than a friend. Ask eagerly for news of his wife. More questions. Affectionate, friendly questions about the woman I love. Can't you understand? We will proceed toward the Marne. In the direction of Chateau Thies. Our planes will be there, ready to take off. The enemy is going to attack. They are playing their last card. We leave in the morning at three. The Captain is on his way here now. I count on you to have everything ready. Thelis is coming back? - Yes. He must have smelled the gunpowder. Forward into battle. Eh, Eugene? Is it really going to be as serious as all that? Serious? You'll be lucky to get out of all this. You'll soon see. They keep their promises about battles. It's different when it's our vacations. See that the men who are absent get their orders. Herbillion isn't here? - Don't worry. We'll tell him. Alright. Yes? What is it? - Your lady is here now, sir. Oh. Thanks. Ask her to wait a few minutes. - Yes, sir. Lieutenant Maury is busy in a meeting with the officers, madam. He asks that you wait just a moment. Thank you. Hey. You're late. We're leaving. What do you mean we're leaving? When? - Tonight. There is an attack on. That's life for you. And I was just getting to like it here. Maybe it won't be so bad. It won't be so bad for you crawling around on the ground. It's them poor fellahs up in the air I'm thinking of. I'd like to see you up there. You'd yell for help so loud you'd frighten the enemy. I'll bet you more than half of them never come back. I've seen these attacks. Suicide. That's what it is, suicide. Will you go in now, madame. Won't you please tell me .. - You will have to excuse me. Am I disturbing you? No, no. Of course not, darling. Sit down. Not over there. Come here. I was looking for you. Where have you been? - I know. I got your message. Forgive me, my dear. I wish I wasn't so busy. What's the matter, darling? Why are you looking at me like that? Was that meeting about something important, Claude? No, it was just .. Why do you try to hide things from me as though I was a child? I know you are leaving. I wasn't trying to hide it from you. I only hoped I might be able to save you a few hours of anxiety. Then it is dangerous? - No more than usual. That's not true. I'm not a fool. I heard the orderlies talking. I saw the men's faces when they came out of here. My dear, dear little Helene, you mustn't get so excited. Nothing is any different. It's still the same war. - But you don't understand. Come in. A letter from headquarters, sir. - Thanks. They must be insane. What is it? Are you leaving right away? - No, no. It's nothing like that. Why it is too absurd. He's calling for a volunteer to go to Paris as an instructor. At a moment like this? To Paris? Imagine offering a post like that on the eve of an attack. Much less anyone accepting it. If only you'd only all stop playing heroes for a minute. Helene. If only you'd stop and think you'd know how it feels to be on the sidelines. And cheer and smile and never show your feelings. When everything you love is in danger. Helene. I can hardly believe. Do you really feel that way? About me? About you? Of course. Oh my dear. You don't know the happiness that gives me. But even you. Couldn't persuade me to desert the squadron at a time like this. Even I. Come in. Ah Herbillion. So they found you. You have heard? We are leaving tonight. Yes, sir. That's what I had to speak to you about, sir. Yes? Well, what is it? May I see you alone? Is it official? - Yes, sir. You can speak in front of Maury. He's in charge until midnight. I'm volunteering for the post offered by headquarters for an instructor in Paris. Oh. I didn't expect to find any volunteers. How did you happen to know about that? A notice hasn't been posted. If I remember right, no-one was with me when I got the note from headquarters. Sorry to insist, Captain. It is important to me personally to know. As a matter of fact, how did you find out, Herbillion? From an officer, sir. What was his name? - I .. I don't know his name. I ran into him at Florence's. Very well. Write out your request. You don't want me for anything further, Captain? I think we've covered everything. Thanks, Maury. Be ready to shove off as quickly as possible. You forget to mention your decoration. Better take a clean sheet and start again. I'll try and make it appear as though you were ordered to this post. I'd rather the others didn't know the truth. They like you. It would be too bad to disillusion them. It's no use. I can't do it. I can't. I wasn't being yellow. I swear I wasn't. I wish I could tell you. Alright, alright. Don't say any more. Is that you, Claude? I'll be right there. I'm all ready. What time ..? Oh .. Captain Thelis. Madame. I thought you were Claude. Won't you sit down? It's about Herbillion. I don't understand. He's leaving with the squadron. But don't you realise, madame .. That if you took Herbillion away, you would lose him forever. What do you mean? Think what it means to him to be away from his squadron. Letters and newspapers bringing him news of the front, of us. He would hate himself more and more every day. And one day. He'd begin to hate you. How can you say this? When he meets a woman unconnected to all this, he'll love her to escape from you. Because as long as you live. You remind him of his weakness. - Stop, please. Stop. The Captain is looking for you, sir. We are leaving at once. Coming .. right away. I don't know what to say. I .. - Don't worry, darling. We'll be back. Oh, surely. Surely, you must come back. Surely. Hurry up, Maury. - The Captain is waiting for you. Goodbye. - Goodbye.1 Hey you! - Yes, sir? Call all the pilots. - Yes, sir. I surely will. Get me my ship. - Yes, sir. Calling all pilots! Calling all pilots. Now listen carefully. I've very little time to waste. We've a tough job ahead. One of the toughest. Here are the orders. Deschamps? - Here. You will act as liaison for the infantry. You'll fly at 30 metres along the Marne until gas runs out. Ignore all firing. Do you understand? - Yes, sir. - Good. Kopf? - Sir? Take the 3 bridges and take bombs with you. Don't give them any warning. - Sir. Duprez. - Yes, sir. Go over there and help with the advanced troops. Be sure you see clearly. Our men are very close to the enemy's lines. Maury. Your orders are very short. Break up the rear line. It's the hardest job of the lot. But I know I can depend on you. Now have you all got that straight? - Right, sir. Hold a minute. I'm going up first to scout the sector. Don't anyone leave until I come back. So long. He's always got to be first. What a great guy. He certainly is. We have to wait for Thelis to get back. Motor all set? - Yes, sir. - All for now. Stand by, we leave any minute. If you need me I'm in the mess. - Wait, Herbillion. There is something I've got to tell you. - Yes? The time has come for you to tell me the truth about .. About you and my wife. - Are you crazy? No, not now. I was crazy when I trusted you. And I didn't suspect your attitude after you came back from Paris. It's all so clear now. Everything hangs together. The way you avoided me. The way you behaved. - You're imagining things, Maury. What about the officer from headquarters who told you about that post in Paris? I didn't have to use much imagination to know who told you about that. Helene was the only one who knew. Look here, Herbillion. There's mighty little chance we will come back today. You know that as well as I do. Come now, a little courage. Let's talk as man to man. What is there between you and Helene? I assume she loves you. - You've no right to assume anything. Herbillion. You are young. There will be other women in your life. She's all I've got. - You must be mad. For the last time .. - You don't know what you talk about. Answer me like a man. Must I insult you to make talk? Maury, stop it .. - Are you so cowardly? Maury. It's Thelis's plane. He's hit. - He's going to crash. He's going into a spin. He'll never pull out. Get a car, quick. Come on. Bring a stretcher, quick! Bring a stretcher. Come on everybody. Double up on your ammunition. We'll make them pay for this. No more ammunition. Turn back. Stand by. Heading for base. Helene. Sorry to bother you. Could you fix my pillows. [ Door knocks ] Come in. A young man to see you, Mr Maury. A young man? - Yes. Well, ask him to come in. I wonder who it can be. Only five minutes I'm afraid. How do you do, Mr Maury. How do you do. I. I am George Herbillion. Oh. This is my wife. He is .. Jean Herbillion's brother. You remember, Helene? The boy who was with me on my last flight. Yes. Come a little closer, young man. Take my hand. Tight. Tighter. Like that. Like your brother used to do. Sit down. How did you know where to find me? We. We had a letter from Deschamps. He told us. But mother wanted to know how. How Jean .. Did he .. suffer very much? In dying? No. Tell me about it, Mr Maury. Tell me please. He was so proud of you. He loved you. You ought to have heard him talk about you. When he was home .. on leave. Mr Maury. When you brought him back. Did he say anything about us? Yes. Yes. His last words. Were for you. And his mother. [ Door knocks ] The time is up, Mr Maury. Yes. Just a minute. Helene. Will you show George the way out. Thank you, George. Thank you for coming. Goodbye, Mr Maury. Goodbye. Goodbye, Madame. - George. I know it might seem strange to you but .. Don't judge me. I loved him. He too. Is that you, Helene? He was nice, that boy. Yes. But you know. I couldn't tell him the truth. I had to lie. The only name. Herbillion mentioned before he died. Was the name of the woman he loved. Her name is .. Den?se. The poor woman. How she must suffer. Don't talk any more, Claude. We must only think about you now. T-G ??
