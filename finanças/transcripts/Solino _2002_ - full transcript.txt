That's my team... That's the car. It's gone now. This was the furnace. That's me. And that's my Johanna. She's also gone now. That's my father. Over there by the furnace is where he would work. When I was a child, I used to think, "My father is special" because he went right into hell every day and came out alive. But what is he today without his hell? A poor man. Good evening. Come on, Gigi! You'll never make it. Yes, I will. They are too fast. - I'll make it. You'll lose the bet. - Nonsense! Whistle if someone comes, okay? Jump! You got him! - Don't let it go. Don't touch my cat! Run, get out of here! What are you doing in here? Come down from there! Come down already! - Let me go! So, you play around on the rooftops? Little bastard. Come here, I'm going to teach you a lesson. Faster! Your son ruined my roof! You'll have to pay for this! Roof ruined... ? How did that happen? Tell me, what have you done? He went up there and was throwing down bricks. So it's only a brick and not the whole roof. - That's petty. You owe me 300 Lira. - For used bricks? You're crazy. - 300 Lira? Well, stuff it! He went crazy! - 300... A sparrow in the house! That means bad luck... Jump! You are the tallest. Get him out of here! 300 Lira. Still 300... Daddy! Rosa, you promised me! Damn it! - You shouldn't curse/ You said if your father doesn't need you anymore we'll go to Germany, just like Franco. I won! - My brother always wins. Shut up! Could you give some space, please? Thank you. - Ciao , Gigi. - Ciao, Ada. How is it in Germany? They got snow. - Real snow? Of course, but not all the time. Only during winter. Not in summer. Me and my brother are going to see the snow now. Giancarlo, Gigi! Come! Let's go home! We go! What's the matter? Would you come already? I said let's go home! I will not come with you. Pack your stuff! If you don't, I'll slap you once more. Madonna, where the heck are you going in such a hurry? - Where's Mama? - I don't know! - Rosa! These are for the ride. - Thank you! They are cookies. I made them on my own. Well, almost on my own... Tasty! Go find out where your mother is! The train is leaving! Mama, the train... You really want to go to Germany? - Yes. It's time to go! We have to leave! Fuck! She's missing the train! - Don't talk like that! Don't leave! Stay! - Stay! Nicola! My Nicolino. You've got to help stop the train! It seems like you're trying to ruin me. You want me to lose my job? Let down the barrier. What does he want? - Yeah, what does he want? Let down the barrier! Who does he think he is? It's ME who lets down the barrier! - HE will let down the barrier! Well fine, just close it, I have to go! Telling ME when I should close the barrier... ! It's going to be closed when I say it! Exactly! - Come on, go! Well, then I'll close it myself! What are you going to do? This is not allowed! I'm the train conductor! - And I'm the manager of the train station! Nicola, we can leave now! Let's go, or we'll miss the train! You forgot your cookies. Oh, the cookies! Will you bring me some snow? - Yes. Promise? - Promise. Here's Franco! How are you? How are you doing? Everything fine? - Yes, I'm fine. Thank you. Here we are, Romano. The second floor. Come on in, Romano. This is the apartment. Nice, isn't it? Mama, there's no bathroom! What? German's have no bathrooms? - They're outside near the stairwell. Near the stairwell. Didn't know onions could be so small... And look at this. And this! Come! He doesn't want to go to work anymore! As if! I don't want to my hands dirty. It's irremovable! What's your problem with the dirt? It shows you are working for your family. You are supposed to eat! Why did we move here? Not for the beauty of the city. We moved for the work in mining. And now you don't want to work anymore. Well kids, as of tomorrow we'll all go for a roundabout! There's plenty more work in Germany, right? I'll work somewhere else. Where? At the steel mill, for example. Because you don't get dirty hands there? Exactly. Delicious pasta, just like back home. What's he saying? - The pasta is delicious like back home. There are no aborigines, no artichokes, no oregano... The onions are measly, and the bathrooms outside near the stairway! They don't even have a bidet! I cannot go back. What are we doing in here? We don't belong here... I don't understand what the people are saying. Let's try, you cannot leave me alone. I need you. Help me. Why doesn't it snow? We are in Germany! So why isn't there snow? Even if it does... how can I bring snow to Solino? By train! - It will melt in the train. Well, let's see... That appears to be fine: "Swei-ber" "Schwei?er" Look up what it means. Welder. No, welder is not good. Where is Giancarlo, I wonder? What's the matter, Mama? Tell me, what it means: "zu ver-mi-e-ten"? It means: "zu vermieten". But what does it mean? - For rent. What's going on? - They're renting out that restaurant down there. So what are you up to? You want to open a business? Franco doesn't have a woman. Same goes for all the others. I see. You want to run a whorehouse! No, I mean... They have no one to cook for them. It's an ice cream parlor. No, Romano, it's a pizzeria! A pizzeria? A pizzeria has square-shaped tables. These are round-shaped. Boys! I'll use checked table-cloth and we'll have a pizzeria. That's not going to make the tables square-shaped. Well, then we are the first to have a pizzeria with round tables. Pizza? It's pie with tomato sauce, isn't it? Let's have a look what's down there. What does it cost? The previous tenant still owes me a month. What an idea! Icecram in winter! What's he saying? - What? - Can you write it? How much is it in lira? Ice cream. - Mmm, it tastes good. - It... tastes... good. Good. Giancarlo says it tastes good! There are others interested as well so you must decide quickly. Bar del Sole. Everyone's there. The children eat ice cream, and... - The adults? - The adults... Coffee and the sort. Johanna! Run and buy cigarettes for me. You know what we should call it? ''Da Romano''. ''Da Rosa e Romano''? "Solino" Just like back home. Just like back home. What's he saying? Good luck! Give it back to me! Get it! Give it to me! - Come and get it! Hold it up to the light. See? Now you've regained your village. - But it is... - Different, yes. What was white is black, and what was black is now white. But... why? I have no more special paper. A camera usually takes negative film. Do you understand? Negative film. - We need a dictionary. - I have one! Stop! If you open the door, the images get destroyed. Signor Klas... I want to photograph snow. Because I need to send snow home... Send. Send the snow back home. I don't know whether it is going to snow any more this year - but look what I have here. Take it. It was brought in for repair, but was never fetched. You can borrow it from me. Thank you, Mr. Klasen. The plates are too full. You put too much on them, they are too big. What do you mean, 'too big'? Where have you been all this time? How am I to pay the rent if you make the plates that big? People eating at our place shouldn't stay hungry. End of story! Look! Everything is flipped! You bought a TV? - It's going to make a lot of money for us! You can't pay the rent but you're buying a TV? No one's got a TV! Not in front of the people, Rosa! But that's why I got it, now they'll all come to our place. What are you doing with the boys? Where did you bring me? The war is over and they haven't changed! The war? What are you talking about? They are guests! Everything is fine. They are shooting a movie. A movie! Come, Giancarlo! From famous Italian director Salvatore Baldi. And they're taking a break here. A break?! Give me a cigarette! A cigarette? But you never smoked! - Then I'll start smoking now! Is that how you smoke? Take a strong puff! You calmed down a bit? Now let's go downstairs and you'll make the best pasta of your life! Yeah. But not for the fascists. Anything else, Signor Baldi? - A Grappa. We'll create this scene with a tracking shot. It's not gonna work. We only have four tracks. Why aren't there any tracks? You didn't say anything about a tracking shot... - I say! Are you able to think by yourself? Apparently not. And neither can this dull, incompetent director of production! Damn idiots! It shouldn't be too hard to find a few meters of tracks! I can't squeeze blood out of a stone. I'm also missing tracks sometimes! Get out of my sight! Bittersweet, just as life! Much better! Thank you, Signor Baldi. Thank you! I'm eating! May I come with you? - You'll come anyway. I want to make movies, just like you do! That's not important. What? It doesn't matter if you're making movies or something else. What's important then? To live with fire and passion/ Fire and passion? How do I do that? Man, you're asking silly questions! You have to tell me how to do it! For example, if you walk through the streets you have to watch things carefully as if everything is extraordinary, as if you see it the very first time! But I know M?hlheimer street very well. Really? Well then. What's on the left side of the street? - A house! Yes, a house. But what does it look like. Grey. - Are you sure? No, it's brown. Now what? Brown or grey? Grey and brown. It's green. - Of course, it's green! It's grey! That's what I said. Are all windows the same? I don't know. Look, that one is totally different. Someone who lives there likes plants. They've stretched threads for the ivy. That's fire and passion? - No. That's biology! What's that? Look! Try this! Thank you, signor Baldi! Listen carefully... You found a barrette for the hair? Be honest. Someone saw you there. It's not a very expensive barrette... but it was filmed in a scene... and in the next scene, it can't just disappear. I haven't taken it... If it isn't found, we'll have to shoot the scene again. But I'm telling you I haven't taken it! Shit! What have you done this time? Do you want to ruin me? I don't wanna see you again in company of those guys, understood? But daddy, I want to make movies, too. Here's your film! You're supposed to go to school! I don't want to see you again around those guys. Understand? Have you ever been in hell? I have. My father took me there. It is hotter than you can handle. But it does not bother my father. He can be there all day. Fire and passion... Do you know what passion is? Of course, you get it if you touch yourself down here. But also from kissing. I like touching down here better. Baldi is looking for you! He wants to say goodbye! - Hey, Carlo. - Hey, Jo. I've got something for you. So beautiful. Thank you. Don't mention it. - Enjoy your pasta. - New images? Ruhr valley in the negative. - See you later, Jo? - Of course. - Can we order now? - Yes. - Where's my Napoli? - 5 minutes. The world's best. Where's Giancarlo? - Outside. Immediately! And turn off that music! It gives me headaches! Giancarlo, you suppose the guests are waiting for you? - Yes, coming. And keep your hands off the girls. Come here, I have to talk to you. Let's have a glass of good Montepulciano. You heard the news, guys? There's another pizzeria now on Market St. Now there are four. But we are the best, and that's not going to change! And now, Gigi, you have to make a decision. Are you going to college for hotel management? I've already told you. My son, you are above average. Different from your brother, who didn't learn anything at school... You got good grades, you got talent. It will take only three years. After that, you and your brother are going to open a restaurant somewhere. In M?lheim or Essen. If things work out well, we'll be number one in the whole Ruhr area. No one can say then that Romano Amato didn't make it. I can't go to that college. I have hired a waiter, so you can go. What a bummer! Don't I pay you well? No... We've been working for free all these years. Fucking shit! That isn?t true! This is our restaurant. We are one family! And that's why you do as I tell you! Or do you want to just take crappy pictures your whole life? Everything depends on it. There's more to life than just pizza. What's that? Fire and passion! What can you buy with fire and passion? - Look what I've got! - What's this? Have one! Rosa, what are you doing? Stop it! It will break! You don't care about your family! - But it's for your nephew, we have to send him something! You only bought the silverware so that everyone says, "Oh, Romano Amato! Look how much he can afford!" You're crazy. You can't afford anything! Wait! Have you gone insane? The whole restaurant is crowded with people! Wait! Just a moment! I need your support! I will pay the bills! Get out of here! Get out! You fucking buggers! Two fucking buggers they are! That's my Montepulciano, you understand? They've stolen my wine! You're gonna pay for all of the bottles! You understand? What's going on in here? They don't have any respect anymore. I work hard the whole day for the restaurant... and they joke about it. Don't you understand? They aren't feeling well. As if! The tune is changing from now on; I don't want to see those pictures anymore! "Everything depends on them. . " You're going to college for hotel management! Period! No people smoking weed in here anymore and drinking my wine! To those who disagree... There's the door! I have always thought that Luigi and Giancarlo would go back to Solino, build a house where we could all live together. But we are doing well, aren't we? I'm cold. Come here. What are you doing? Take it easy! Are you to take the big room and give me the small one? Don't talk shit, they are the same size. Sure... Yeah, sure! Can't you see they're the same? What are you doing? What kind of arrangement is this... that I have to jump to go to the bathroom? - Where shall I go? - Go sleep in the wardrobe. I've turned it into a dark-room. - A what? - My dark-room! Would you mind if I papered the corridor? - What? - No. Beat it, you pansy! Look! - Do you like it? - Yeah! - It's pretty. - It's yours. Thanks! Leave it in my room. I like it! It's very feminine. - Like Vasarely. - Vasa... who? Vasarely, a great abstract painter. You must've heard of him. No. Do you wanna go to the movies? We got no money. We'll find a way to get in. I'm stayng here. Hello. Good morning! - Buono? Good? - Si! Why don't you come back? You need work. - I got work. - Where you work at? At Koslowski's car workshop. Gigi, at least you! I can't do it alone. I'm getting more tired each day. I need someone supporting me. Think about it. Come back, at least. Do it for your mother. Please! Come on. - Where did you get the car from? - Workshop. Can you just use it? They are going to notice it. Not before Monday. She's sleeping. - You can't do this! We live here together. - So what? You sleep with others, right? What if she falls in love? You must not do it. She'll die if she falls in love and finds out you're sleeping with another girl. - You just want to sleep with her yourself! - Leave her alone! Beat it. What is going on? Nothing. Giancarlo, wait! This is new. It's a Super-8 camera. It has a "stop" function. It can be set to one second. that means one image per second. So you can shoot clouds, for example. If you run the film with 24 frames per second - You can see the clouds race by. - It actually kinda looks like a race. - Sure. I need to have it. Dad, we need to talk about my salary. I don't need to talk about anything. Why can you never pay me properly? What do you need the money for? Buy a camera. The pizzeria is already full of pictures! A camera. I want to make films. Who needs films? Education is what you need, but you didn't want it. You could have made it far. You can have success with filmmaking. I've never asked you for money before-- Don't bother me now. I deserve it, damn it! I have worked for it. I want the camera, I want to make movies! Pick it up. Pick it up! I said... - I'll pick it up! They have to be cleaned anyway. - Giancarlo. - What? - What are we going to do? - Don't be such a fool! If you want something bad, you just take it. Let's just come tomorrow. Nothing will go wrong. Come! What shall I do? What shall I do? - Giancarlo! - What? Nothing. This is stealing! Fucking fire and passion! You never change. Get in! Why me? It's you who wants the damn camera! Get in! Fuck! Be quiet! Now go back and grab the till. Go! I haven't come here for nothing! Go! No. Fuck you! Grab it now! No! I can't. Giancarlo! Leave him alone! Next time it's more than one night. Next time they won't let you leave again! That's where you belong! Are you okay? Where is the camera? - What is this? - Your share. - It was my camera. - We stole it together, it was both of ours. I was the one put in prison while you fled away from me Just like the sparrows, remember? - Which sparrows? - You know what I mean. Go fuck yourself! - Mr. Klasen... - What is it? I'm sorry. You are an idiot. A loser! Because of you two losers, I can't lock the door anymore. And I think I may know who the other loser was! It is my part. Come inside. What was your penalty? - Pick up garbage in the park. - And you still have no camera. I don't have one, either... Well, at least not a Super-8. This is a Bolex. It is a bit old but it still works. It must be drawn up. Then it runs for 30 seconds. Try it. - Mr. Klasen... - Not a word! Thank you! I don't deserve it. That's is my father. Over there by the furnace is where he would work. When I was a child, I used to say, "My father is special" because he went right into hell every day and came out alive. But what is he today without his hell? A poor man. Clap your hands! Exactly 30 seconds. How was that? Good. Very good. - What are you laughing at? - Nothing. Do you prefer it down there? ... raises his guard again. Zack Clayton allows them to continue with the fight. Foreman swingsrapidly... but again, has been knocked back! Everyone can see that he's is having some difficulties. Here come's a right, and that's it! Unbelievable... Good morning. Good morning. Shut up! I thought we liked each other. But we do like each other. It's Romano's special ros?. We had a wine that was absolutely fantastic. - What are you doing? - Making antipasti. But that's not on the menu card. So what? The menu card is not good enough for the blonde one? These are regular guests. We have to pamper them. That's part of the job. For who am I doing this? For our family and for you. For me? When will there be someone supporting me in the kitchen? I'm tired, I can't do it anymore! But you always managed to. The restaurant didn't expand. We still have the same number of tables. Good evening. Come in please. - I'm Rainer. - And I'm Ulli. This is Rainer Baumann from the film festival. That's the car. It's gone now. And that's my Johanna. She's also gone now. Everything's gone. That's my father. When I was a child, I used to say, "My father is special" because he went right into hell every day and came out alive. But what is he today without his hell? A poor man. ''It's all gone now'' A film by Luigi Amato Thank you. Good job. - Do you have a beer? - Yes, in the fridge. - I really liked the film. - Me too. - A little sad, but good. - Of course it's a good one. - I didn't understand the end. - What? Damn. - He wants it at Ruhr Film Festival. - No! But that doesn't mean it's chosen. - I don't care. - Relax! Let's take a picture of you two. - Like this? - Yes, we must support local talent. - Ready? - Yes. OK? "Rainer Baumann Discovers New Talent From Duisburg" What are you doing? Hey! Did you see that? I can't believe it. Where should I sleep now? Why didn't you come earlier? This is the first time she has been in such pain. After moving in, she just cried a lot. That's not what I mean. Is she often tired or worn out? Yes, she becomes exhausted from all of the hard work. There are more tests that need to be done, but it appears as if -- she suffers from a kind of leukemia. Leukemia? Did he say leukemia? The kind of leukemia your mother has... is incurable. What's he saying? How much time do I have left? Some patients may live another 20 years. But... others don't live that long... Yes. They can't tell. I want to go home. To daddy? Home. When will you come? Soon. I wanted to film the demolition of the factory in Bottrop. You do it. OK. I'll take care of Mum... you keep your hands off Jo. OK? It's okay with me if you're going to be staying in grandpa's house. So, you're going back? No. Daddy stays in Germany. He has to manage the restaurant. So you're going to stay with your mother? Actually, I want to go back as soon as possible. Why didn't you send any snow? What? You promised. Don't you remember me? Yes, I do. You're Ada. We were friends, and you promised. I forgot. You forgot to speak Italian as well? The Pharisee and the scholars grumbled and said, "The sinner takes care of them and will eat with them. " But he told them about the parable and said... We've been to the hospital. And why didn't they keep her? It's not what she wanted. You should've known that. She's stubborn. They said it's enough when she goes in two times a week. That's fine. - Yes. But I have to go, how can I manage this? She'll be all right, running the errands, cooking, and alike. But someone has to bring her to the hospital twice a week. I know, I'm very demanding. - Yes! You're expecting a lot! I have work to do. And Paola is busy all day long! But that's not the problem. You can't leave your mother alone. She doesn't want to stay in hospital. I can't leave her. You must come. Your film has been selected for the festival. - What? - Yes, it has! You must come! Giancarlo, you must come! What? You come here and I'll come to Duisburg. - When is the film on? - On 23rd. In the evening. I'm leaving on 22nd at noon and you can take the night train. Giancarlo, you must! Hello? Hello? OK, I'll come. "My darling Jo, Things aren't going as I had imagined. "I hope I'll see you soon. Say hello to everyone. "I miss you, Gigi." I've heard you're leaving tomorrow. - Yes. This is for your journey. I remembered you like cookies. Get on the train please! Keep the barrier open! I'll be right back! You understand? I have to take that train! I have to tell my mother! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Where is Giancarlo? He didn't come? Do you see him? 20th Ruhr Film Festival Award Ceremony And now the last -- And most important award of the festival. The Main Award at the 20th Ruhr Festival goes to the movie: ''It's all gone now'' by Luigi Amato That's amazing! - Luigi, can you come up here? - Someone has to go up. - It's not my movie! - Luigi, where are you? You must go up! Oh, there he is! Luigi Amato! Congratulations! Congratulations! Hey, Franco! Is there basil in the sauce? - Yes, mom. You won! Your movie is first place! What? Mr. Amato? Your film was exceptional. I liked it a lot. Could I ask you some questions? Yeah. Let's go upstairs. It's less noisy. You got it? Yes! That's the right one. Thank you. ''Luigi Amato, surprising winner from Duisburg. '' Yes, it's you! I know. They must have made a mistake, what do I know? I do not understand. Why is Gigi not here? He wanted to come. The TV people have called and made an offer. Have you told him that? - Have you told him? - No! - So call now! - My mother has no telephone. - So call someone at the cafe. - There's no one there now. He told me that he was going to Italy for only a couple of days. And then he disappeared for weeks! He has not even sent me a postcard. Where did you go? Why didn't you come? - You said you would come! - It's over now! - You must go to Solino. - Forget it. Someone must look after her. It's your turn. - I will not go. - Me neither. So nobody goes, then. All right. What did he mean that you did not come? He expected me to be there. You didn't tell me that. I must have forgotten. Did you tell Gigi about the TV people, or did you forget that too? They were talking to me about making movies. - But they meant Gigi. - Yes, Gigi... But it was me they asked. Do you understand? They asked me to make movies! It was me they asked. For once in life, just once, it's all about me. Me! Can't you understand that? No, wait! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! You know it's not possible. Your mother doesn't want to see me. - It's a good excuse. - I'm sorry, Gigi. - Do not say you're sorry. - Not in front of guests. What would they hear? That you betrayed your wife? That you are in bed with others while she is lying sick in Italy? I told you to keep your mouth shut! - Hi! - Hi. I've visited your mother. Paola is very busy today so I cooked for her. She's already taken her medicine. Thanks. You're welcome! How are you, mom? What happened? Look, you can do anything you like in here. You can even read the newspaper, if you like. You just have to make sure that those brats don't mess up the place or keep the shower water running. That's all! It's a good job. And? Where have you been, Gigi? We've been waiting for an hour! Easy! Well, come on! I got something for you! For me? - Yes, for you. Later. All right. It's just the two of us! - Yes. I want to watch your movie just like in a movie theatre! The wall is too dirty. Not good for watching. Wouldn't it be nice to have a movie theatre again? "Ardore" Try with "amore"... That was correct! What are you doing here? How are you? I'm fine. You remember how often you argued with your father because he couldn't understand that you wanted to make movies? Sure. And when you stole the camera you even went to jail. What are you trying to say, mom? It's beautiful here, isn't it? Go and live your life, Gigi! What? Go and live your life! Thanks for the light, Gigi! You never thought about living somewhere else? Why do you ask? I don't know... I thought... you'd come too. Can you see the stars in German cinemas? No. I want to take something from you with me. Tell me something. Well, okay. My name is Ada. I hate sports. And I only go to the sports games because Gigi Amato is there. Which color is the wall behind you? Yellow. But it's not painted yellow. The bricks have aged that color. Solino Restaurant. Wait a moment, please. Romano! What's up? Telephone. It's me, Gigi. What a great surprise! It must be ten years since the last time we talked. How are you? - I'm fine, dad. Nice to hear... What's the matter? Dad, I'm going to marry. Will you come? I'm so happy for you. I really would like to come, but the restaurant... Always so much work. It's always so crowded! I really would like to come, but I can't. I'm sorry. I would like to but I cannot come. Congratulations. All the best. Gigi... I love you. - Ciao. - Ciao, daddy. - Daddy! - Daddy! Let's go. I'm so happy you've made it. Thanks for inviting me. You're still my brother. How's Mum? She will survive, say the doctors. - Ciao, Gigi. - Ciao, Donatella. - Ciao. How's the old man? Not so well. There are many Italian restaurants in Duisburg. And they cook better than Dad's Pakistanis. And Jo? She's gone to Berlin. A little after you left. Which one is she? Fifth from right. Paolo, would you please sit down and eat! You don't hear your grandma? Sit down where your sister is! Eat! Their own kids at the wedding... - Times are changing! I heard that, Paola! Giancarlo is in television business. So we can see you on TV, Uncle Giancarlo? No, not really... So he's not on TV? - Yes, he is on TV! I told you, he's in the television business. Yes, I'm doing documentaries. So no television? But that is television! Is there really no snow in Germany? You have kids? You got a wife? - They speak different than we do? If I had... wife and kids, they'd probably speak different, but I... don't have wife and kids. When I was a child, I used to think, "My father is special" because he went right into hell every day and came out alive. But what is he today without his hell? A poor man. Well. That was my first movie. It's already quite old... And now, would you like to watch my latest movie? Yes, Gigi! Show us the movie! The first traffic sign for Solino is being installed. The funeral procession. Will it stand? Will it stand? Will it stand? Will it stand? A film by Luigi Amato
