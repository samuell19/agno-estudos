(ominous music) - [Man] It was a Saturday night. - [Woman] It was a discotheque where a lot of Americans, G.I.s went in. - [Man] I was the manager. - [Woman] I was a bartender, barkeeper. We had a lot of fun over there. The Americans were pretty much party people. (laughs) I knew Edward before. He came three months before that thing happened. Sometimes with his friends, Sometimes he came alone, and he would sit at the bar. What I can remember he was... a little bit shy. But when you knew him a little while, he was very friendly, very friendly. When he came in he was very lucky that he got two places right by where the beer taps are. There was a girl with him, and it seemed to me like he was very interested. And she also. Like she gave him the feeling maybe there can happen something between us. Then there was a third person. He was standing in the back and always staring at Edward and that girl. So I always watched him. And when they left the Western Saloon, Between 12:00 and 12:30 I think. I saw that guy follow them. The next day, they showed me the pictures of Edward's body. Like he was found. And the open wound in his face from the shot. His side was broken open, everything bloody. (melancholy music) My brother was like a superhero. My brother was like immortal. Whatever he did, I wanted to do. Whatever he was, I wanted to be. He met some Germans, befriended them. He left the bar with a woman he had just met, and the next morning he was found dead in the woods, shot in the head. We had a Catholic wake and a service, and we weren't gonna have an open casket, 'cause he didn't look so great. But we all wanted to see him. We all wanted to know that it was actually him. He was given a military burial with honors at Maple Grove Cemetery in our neighborhood. And even though it was in the middle of Queens, in the middle of a weekday, my brother got a 21-gun salute. And I was a little freaked out to hear guns at my brother's funeral when I was still like, oh my god, my brother was shot in the head. That part was a little difficult. (guns blasting) At first we didn't know anything about why my brother had been shot. And then, about a week later, a letter arrived at a news agency, claiming responsibility. And they had sent in his ID card. And then we found out that he had been kidnapped so that they could steal his ID to get a bomb onto a U.S. airbase that exploded and killed two other people. When I first heard they were terrorists, I was very confused about whether or not they were Middle Eastern, and when it turned out they were actually German, then there was just this disconnect, 'cause it didn't fit the stereotype in my head that they would be Middle Eastern people. So I was confused at first, and I was like, German terrorists, what's that? All that I knew was that they had planted this bomb and that two other people had died. And they were called the Red Army Faction. To me, the Red Army Faction was just a bunch of monsters. They were just horrible, horrible, subhuman people. And I had no problem, in the beginning, saying they should all just be lined up and shot. - [Desireena] When we were teenagers, Kathleen was one of my closest friends. The murder of her brother changed Kathleen's life. And years later, it would change mine. Kathleen and I were friends in high school in New York City. I was one of the few people she told about Eddie's murder at the time. In a sea of urban liberal teenagers, Kathleen stood apart. - [Kathleen] Pretty much every conservative idea, like at some point or another, I've held. Like the inevitability of war, the importance of trying to win a nuclear war. - [Desireena] I completely disagreed with her politics, but something about her self-assurance drew me in. Kathleen and I were from different worlds. I was a recent immigrant from the Philippines, living with my mom, dad, and four siblings. Kathleen would visit us often, but I never met her family. At 14, she seemed fully self-sufficient, and had that very American air of self confidence. I knew she lived with her mom, her grandparents, and her sister. Later I found out that her family were Mexican-American, from Texas. She planned to follow in her brother's footsteps, to enlist in the Army and pursue a career in the military. Not long after his death, she also came out as gay. On both counts, I was speechless. We soon drifted apart, and lost touch after graduation. But for years, I felt that I wanted to find her. When she came back to New York to care for her terminally ill mother, we reconnected. She told me she'd been working with people in prison, and kept talking about something called restorative justice. - [Kathleen] People change, we change our perspectives, we change our actions. - [Desireena] As fiercely conservative as Kathleen once was, she was now just as fiercely progressive. Then she told me something that blew my mind. She said she wanted to meet with Eddie's killers. I was utterly shocked. It was the opposite of everything I knew. How would it work? What would reconciliation look like? I felt so lost after Eddie was dead. I still felt like I was seeking his approval. It felt like he was a constant presence. - [Desireena] At school, Kathleen kept seeing glimpses of Eddie in the hallways. I would see the back of someone's hair, it was like short brown hair. Or I would just see their eyes with glasses, and I'd be like, oh my god. And it was just so, I mean I just missed him so much that I was constantly like, maybe that's him. There was such a feeling of like, maybe he's not dead. And you know, especially 'cause I was a teen. I mean I had seen his body, but I was still like no, no, maybe he's not dead; it was total magical thinking. (soft guitar music) We grew up totally on top of each other. There were six of us in a two-bedroom apartment. My grandparents shared a room. My mom and my sister and I shared a bedroom, and my brother slept on the couch. He would make that bed every evening, so he could sleep in it, and he would make it every morning. He and my sister would get out of the house together. My sister was a teenager with him, and they would get to go out hang out with their friends. We were very patriotic, we were really proud to be American, like a lot of Latino families. We felt like we had a responsibility to protect the country that we loved. My mom joined the Navy when she was a young woman. My aunt became a civilian with the military. My grandfather was really proud when both my mother and my aunt found men to marry who were in the military. - [Desireena] By the time I met Kathleen in high school, she never mentioned a father. During our junior year, right after Eddie's death, Kathleen's family found out she was gay. I hated being gay. We were a really Catholic family, a really conservative Catholic family, and I think we were all struggling with the idea that I was going to burn in hell. - [Desireena] At Stuyvesant, Kathleen was perpetually clad in her brother's green Army jacket. The jacket was not only a cloak of mourning, but marked Kathleen as queer, even before she articulated it. At some point, she began a relationship with a girl in our clique, and although she would come out to us, she was very mindful of their privacy. As someone who was thinking about my own sexuality, I was quietly in awe. I think there were lots of kids at Stuyvesant who took a more liberal view of sexuality and sexual orientation, but I was not among them. Eddie had made his views on homosexuality really clear, of how much he disapproved. Matter of fact, my brother and I were once walking and he crossed the street because there was a gay bar and he said we should not even walk near it. Then mostly I was like, what is a gay bar? I didn't even know. My mom and my sister freaked out. They both made it clear that it was an unholy abomination. And, I was gonna go to hell. My mom was like, if you're not gonna live within God's rules you're gonna have to leave my house. You gotta go, you gotta leave. I moved into this period of time where then I just started questioning everything I had learned. (people protesting, yelling) - [Desireena] Years earlier, across an ocean, a generation of Germans were loudly questioning everything that they had learned, as well. - [Woman] You know what kind of pigs we're up against. This is the Auschwitz generation. How can we allow them to murder in our name? Americans, out of Vietnam. - [Desireena] The Red Army Faction was just one of many leftist groups, born out of the protest movements of the 1960s. - [Woman] We have had enough of providing the veneer of democracy. - [Desireena] In Europe and America, the far left showed their affinity for Marxist revolutions taking place in Vietnam, Cuba, Venezuela, and elsewhere in the world by, as they put it, bringing the war home. (drumming music) They believed that capitalism was the main cause of oppression and inequality worldwide. American imperialists were the chief enforcers, and West Germany their leading client state. - [Woman] This is where we come from, from the brainwashing of the media. From consumerism, from the ideology of powerlessness. From depression, illness. From all the exploited peoples who are oppressed by imperialism. (gun blasting) - [Man] If the police fire on us again, we will shoot back. People feel there's nothing to be done about the situation. But the struggle has begun! - [Desireena] The RAF's actions became increasingly more violent. (hard driving music) Through nearly decades, they robbed banks, bombed prisons and U.S. military bases, hijacked planes, took hostages, and assassinated political and financial leaders. (intense music) They made America's Weather Underground look like the Boy Scouts. (music intensifies) The RAF was West Germany's public enemy number one. But to the far left, they were heroes. They also became a political, cultural, and media obsession. (explosion and music drowns out singing) - [Desireena] Articles, documentaries, fictionalized accounts. Many members became household names. Even Eddie's murder became shorthand. You know, it was odd that there was always this woman as part of the murder. I didn't really think much about it, 'cause I didn't think she'd ever be captured. And then in '93, she was arrested. In 1996, when Birgit Hogefeld was convicted of the crime, it was 11 years after the crime, and it didn't feel like it was really gonna change anything. I felt that little piece of satisfaction, but what I was surprised to find out was that it didn't really have any better picture of what had actually happened at the end of my brother's life. I knew that there were two members of the Red Army Faction in prison, 'cause I had read about them on political prisoner websites. And I didn't quite know who this other woman was. And that was Eva Haule. She was convicted for conspiracy to plant the bomb. (birds chirping) Dear Miss Hogefeld, I hope this letter finds you well. I am Kathleen Pequeño and I live in Portland, Oregon. I am Edward Pimental's younger sister. I was 15 when my brother died, so I've lived most of my life without him in it, and I've come to the point where I want to have a different relationship to former members of the Red Army Faction. I'm not satisfied with the resolution provided to us by the criminal justice system, in which we are all supposed to go our separate ways. You to prison, my family to our invisible grief on the outside. (gentle music) I think that is incorrect and counter to the sort of world I want to live in. If possible, I would like to get to know you, and to know how Eddie's death has affected you, your life, and your family in the decades since. - [Desireena] I followed Kathleen to Chicago, where was attending a conference. She was also hoping to meet with a former member of an American leftist militant group in preparation for her first trip to Germany. (phone ringing) Hi, is this Bill? [Bill] Yup. Hi Bill, this is Kathleen Pequeño. We exchanged some email. - [Desireena] Bill Ayers, who was a leading member of the Weather Underground, an American group that was roughly equivalent to the RAF. [Bill] I'm terribly sorry about your loss, I know it was a long time ago. Thank you. I'm sure it's still very raw. And, You know, I doubt very much that I can give you any help, But, you know, I'm happy to say hi. I mean basically I'm putting out feelers to various people who have some proximity to armed struggle. That's just, you know, and so that would include you. [Bill] Have you talked to Jeremy Varon? Do you know Jeremy? Um, I don't know him, and so he's, I just added him to my list. So do you have contact with him? I have talked to him. But he's a very nice, very accessible young historian. And our last talk he was looking for a woman to date. (laughs) Yeah, okay, I don't know that I'll be able to help him there. He's a thoughtful guy and he wrote this book, about Baader Meinhof and Weathermen, and I can't remember what else. "Bringing the War Home." He will probably know some of the players involved. He would know what exists because he is a very serious historian. That's great, you know, that could be really helpful. [Bill] But if I hear anything I'll let you know. I mean I doubt that I will, I haven't over all these years. But I'm sympathetic with your desire to know more and understand more about it. I have to find Jeremy Varon. - [Desireena] A month later, we were in Brooklyn to speak with Varon. I asked Varon about the political environment that gave rise to the RAF. Many members of the German left saw contemporary forms of injustice in post-war Germany as echoes of the great injustices of the Nazi regime. Their view was that their parents had been complicit in the crimes of fascism, or had done nothing to stop the perpetration of an enormous evil, so for German activists, the war in Vietnam was a new instance of genocide. Fighting against the Vietnam war, they were in a sense fighting against the legacy of Auschwitz. The idea is that they would rise to the moral challenge of their time in a way that their parents had failed. Into the 1980s, the Red Army Faction continued to try to strike directly at members of the American military, and then the tragic episode in 1985 in which Pimental was killed is an expression of that mindset. - [Desireena] Kathleen wanted to find out what contacts Varon had within the German left. Who do you know that you might be able to put me in touch with? I know a researcher whose doing work on some of the former prisoners, and then I know a number of historians of Germany, both in Germany and the United States, who have personal contact with some of the former members. But going back to your brother, I mean you say that you want to meet them without any sense of animosity, but they after all were involved in killing your brother. That seems like a remarkably gracious attitude to take. Can you truly meet them without any sense of animosity? I think there's, I know there are parts of this I will get angry about all over again, but it's not right or useful to direct that anger at them. Well is there a risk for you in reopening old wounds? Anything that was reopened, I guess wasn't fully healed anyway, and so for me it's an opportunity to get to finish my healing process. And for me, that's lifelong. I'm gonna live my whole life without my brother. It's a way of being with him. - [Kathleen] I mean, it's the way he's in my life now. At one level, he didn't matter to them. He was incidental, he had something useful to them, and the great irony is that you want to humanize them in a way that they certainly didn't humanize your brother. I would be curious what their political evolution was like, and how they concocted a sense of mission. But I don't want to go back and have a 30-year-old argument. I want a chance to get to know them and figure out like, what should we be doing now? What do you see about the world now? What did you learn about it, being in prison? What's the most pressing work for us to be doing for a better world now? Okay, I mean, I'm a little confused, because what unites you with them is the murder of your brother. What is special or important about their perspective on what needs to be done today that you want to sort of get at? I mean, they're not just any social justice activists. They're not, I mean, yeah. Or any ex-prisoners, they're people who were strong adherents of an ideology that cost you and your family an enormous amount. My guess is that you're separating now from then in a way that is gonna prove very difficult over time because they're so deeply interconnected. To me, I'm not necessarily going to be doing anything like dissecting them, around like, what led to committing the murder? I mean and it's based, I've had a chance to meet and connect with lots of people who've done lots of horrible things, by working with people convicted of serious and violent crimes. And I'm like right, if they'd been thinking, they wouldn't have done it. But these people were thinking, that they had a very well-developed, if rigid, world view. I'm pretty sure they were kinda wrong if they thought that killing my brother was gonna end American imperialism. I'm pretty sure most people would say they're wrong now. So I don't think it's end of story, but I think the place for us to connect is in the present. I mean the place to figure out how, we both had 25 plus years to live with this murder, and that's actually the place for me, where I think there's the most place to learn. It seems like you don't want from them contrition. It would be very understandable if you did. It would be. If some part of you would want to sort of rattle their conscience, (It would be useful.) and have them break down and come to terms with the very real and devastating pain that was caused, and maybe have them apologize and you offer forgiveness. You don't want that, or at least you say you don't want that. It seems like you want to see in them redemption, not contrition, but redemption. Who they are now, how their politics have evolved and changed, the good that they're trying to do for the world, and then redemption may well be a part of their story. But you seem so intent to privilege redemption over guilt, and what if they don't seem all that contrite? Will you be able to see them as redeemed? - [Desireena] Varon put into words something that was nagging at me. Why was Kathleen so invested in the lives of people who had hurt her so deeply? To try to make sense of all of this, I spoke with Ellis Cose, author of a book about forgiveness and reconciliation. - Restorative justice is basically the idea that, and it's very much linked to this whole idea of forgiveness, that you somehow restore a person's ability to function in society and what they have lost, as opposed to just be taking retribution for something that has happened. And often how you see it playing out is that there are various organizations and even societies which encourage there to be interaction between the perpetrators and the victims. And a sense of understanding emerges, and a sense of communicating the outrage, the anger, the injury, and ideally, being repaired for that in some way. (soft music) - [Desireena] In her book, Birgit Hogefeld had written eloquently about her feelings of remorse regarding Edward's death. [Birgit] Today when I try to imagine, to picture such a situation, When I imagine that someone would go out and shoot a young man dead because he's a soldier in the US Army, and he possesses an I.D. that they want, then I find that gruesome and inhumane in the deepest way possible. And there were times in my life when I could justify the shooting death of a U.S. soldier, or a car bomb on the air base in Frankfurt or Ramstein, or the Schleyer kidnapping. Today I have a greater inner distance from that attitude. - [Desireena] Hogefeld had written back to Kathleen, acknowledging her loss, but refusing to meet in person. But we still hoped that through another contact, she would change her mind. Gerold von Braunmuhl was the right-hand man to the German Minister of Foreign Affairs. The RAF accused him of strategizing in secret to strengthen NATO missile systems in Europe, increasing the possibility of a new Holocaust, a nuclear one. Two masked RAF members shot Gerold in the head in front of his house while his daughter was home. No one was ever convicted. We met with Gerold's brother, Carl Christian. He himself had met several times with Hogefeld, so we asked him why he thought she might be unwilling to meet with Kathleen. Whatever Birgit Hogefeld did or did not do, surely it is extremely likely that she knows a great deal about how Kathleen's brother died. And she is firm in her decision, as she has been from the start, to keep silent on the issue. She does not want to speak about it. She doesn't... want to burden anyone. She doesn't want to betray anyone. And it's very possible that she thinks Kathleen wants to hear how it was. How it was and who it was. And that is exactly what she doesn't want to say. After Eddie died, I realized what it really means to kill people, and I was like oh, I will never be able to do that. Sorry. And we'd always grown up talking about war, but not really understanding it. Shoot. Mostly what happened was that, well, I think mostly my mother was really sad, and mostly I was really angry. I just assumed these people were monsters and not human beings. Sometimes in the years since all of this has unfolded, my biggest frustration with my family has been wanting to say to them, have you learned nothing? Yeah, because once we learned this, once we had experienced this, how could you ever wish this on, how could you ever think this would be okay for another family? When people are in a narrow, ideological cage, that's a form of, well, dogmatism is like a mild illness. And totalitarianism is a severe illness. The important question is, How does a person get into that narrow cage, and how does he maybe get out of it again? And I think that terrorists, that is, perpetrators and victims, in general, when they talk to each other, they can do tremendous things that no one else can do, towards making it stop. - [Desireena] By the end of our trip, there was no response from Hogefeld, and I still couldn't fully comprehend Kathleen's motivations. (soft music) But when I went with her to meet a man she had worked with in prison, their genuine affection for each other moved me. They met in 1997 in a maximum security prison. John Castro was serving 25 years to life for murdering his stepfather, a man who he believed was sexually abusing his sisters. Kathleen was working for a nonprofit organization, and was asked to take on a project in the prison system, where she got to know John. After 21 years in prison, John was finally granted parole and released last year. I saw the pictures that were posted on your trip to Berlin, but there wasn't a whole lot of conversation about it. I know, I've never actually met with other people who had someone killed by the same group. It's strange to have that in common with someone. - [John] You know the ladies that you were trying to come across over there in Germany, what kind of connections have you made with them? They're not that interested in meeting with me. Or even talking to me, so. Did they say what their reluctance was? Yeah one of the women has never answered me. The other one, I think she's worried it's not gonna go well. I wish they could talk to some of the people I know here, be like, no, she really will just keep showing up for you. Yeah, but you know what, that's what you need to do sometimes. - [Kathleen] I know. You need to just keep showing up, and at some point in time, something can happen. Still easier to show up when it's not 6,000 miles away. - [John] Well then move there. (Kathleen chuckles) At this point I'm like, I'm gonna try and go there once a year and just keep letting them know that I'm coming. You know, see what comes of it. Did you ever tell people how much I broke out into a sweat with you in our first interview? - [Kathleen] 'Cause I was so big and tough? 'Cause you were so big and tough. - [Kathleen] I made the convicts sweat? Yep, here I dealt with all them crazy guys in there and didn't blink an eye, but when you walked in, I got more self-conscious. You know you were probably the first individual that I had communicated with in that fashion while I was in prison. - [Kathleen] Like someone coming in from the outside just to talk to you about something? (Yeah.) Alrighty. There we go. Well thank you for coming, and we'll see you again. I know, you know I'll see you again. (soft music) - [Desireena] As time passed, Kathleen moved back to New York to get married, and her search for former RAF members was put on hold. Three years later, our quest came back to life when I found Annett Zupke, a restorative justice facilitator based in Berlin. Hi. Hi, Annett. - [Annett] So whom did you write, Hogefeld? I wrote to Hogefeld, and... And what did she respond? She responded with a certain openness to talking with me, she's always been respectful, and we had a brief email correspondence, but yeah, she's basically not interested in meeting with me. So she explicitly said that she's not interested in meeting you? - [Kathleen] Yes. Okay. Yeah, and then Eva Haule, who was connected to the crime later, she has never answered at all. So frankly, I got a little kinda stuck. (laughs) And I've wondered about doing some sort of surrogate dialogue. People have mentioned that to me, restorative justice folks. I mean, what do you think about that? I don't know. One of my questions would be, what is that you're hoping for? Or what are questions you have where you believe only they could be answering them? I want to know that I have excavated whatever is there that keeps me from being able to think of them as fully human. And that having a real life person would force me to do different parts of that. I recently was thinking if there's one thing that you and those women from the RAF have in common, then it's a dream to live in a different world. And to contribute to a different world. The means that they chose created a lot of harm, but maybe trying to connect around this, this desire to having an impact into the world and create something differently, if you find words for that and make your intention more visible. (intense violin music) - [Desireena] Back in Germany, two former revolutionaries with ties to the RAF have come forward through Annett's network, and are willing to meet with Kathleen. The first is a woman we'll call Vera. - [Kathleen] Hi, there. So are we sitting at a table? (speaking in German) Hello Kathleen, nice to meet you. It's good to meet you. Let's sit. What spot is mine? Just choose. I would like to sit here. Yeah, yeah, I'll sit over there. Because I feel comfortable. - [Kathleen] So I don't want to pry, but anything you want to tell me about your experience, I would like to hear. My parents were young in the 1930s and 40s, my father was in the army, And when I came to know about the German history, I was 13 or 15, I asked them, what have you done during the war? And they said, we didn't know anything. Sorry. It was so shocking for me. That I decided I would never allow developments like this again in Germany. And my parents always kept saying they hadn't known what was going on, especially about the destruction of the Jewish people and the concentration camps. Later I came to know about the Vietnam War. This was a thing I thought, this couldn't be right. I went to a lot of demonstrations and teach-ins. Then the police came with water and sticks and hit us. And then some people started to throw stones at the police. The police get more arms, and then there were more stones, and the police get guns and things like that. - [Desireena] Participating in an action to free a comrade, the group shot a prison guard. Vera was later caught and spent 11 years in prison. Do you feel anything like regret for the actions that took you to prison? No. My involvement in these things was voluntary. No one forced me into anything. I'm prepared to deal with the consequences of what I did. And maybe it's my good luck that I didn't kill anybody in those years. But still, there were certainly some injuries, physical as well as emotional, of course. Maybe "regret" isn't really the best word after all. Because I am sorry, my standpoint today is yes, I am sorry that because of the movement and the part I played in it, other people got hurt. What I do have is a willingness to deal with it, And work through it, like the way we're sitting here right now. You know, parts of this are very hard, but then other times it's easy to just remember that you're, we don't have the same experience, but you're not that different from me. And so, yeah. But it's hard to hold onto both sometimes. I can imagine this. (sad piano music) - [Desireena] On one of our free days, Kathleen and I decided to tour an old East German prison. Walking through the cells, I was reminded of Eva Haule, the woman who had spent 21 years in prison for conspiracy in Eddie's murder. [Eva] How should one describe it, when in prison day in and day out over years and years, one always sees the same thing, walks the same paths? It reduces the gaze; numbs one; rots the senses. Photography opens up the gaze again. The women that I have photographed are in their own way very strong. They fight their way through life, and try to go their own way and maintain their dignity. What some people have said is that Eva Haule has no regrets, has no opinion that anything the group did was wrong. That every killing was justified. - [Desireena] Show me, where she is? She's back here. - [Desireena] Later that week, Vera met with Kathleen again. This time, to show her the drawings she had made in prison. There was one other former revolutionary to meet on this trip. His name was Axel Waeldele. (guns blasting) (people shouting) - [Reporter] Good evening from Paris, the capital city of a country that is tonight mourning the victims of the worst terrorist attack in Europe for 10 years. - [Desireena] Kathleen's meeting with Axel Waeldele happened to take place the day after the Paris terrorist attacks. So mostly last night, I was just really sad. And I just have this sense that what I'm actually doing with these dialogues doesn't matter. Why, or where does this feeling come from that it doesn't really matter? Just that war is so seductive. And that every time this happens, more people just get pulled in. Yes, this trend is hard to stop, but, there are many hopeful things. That you are in a place to sit down with me with such openness and meet me in this way, even though, I was connected to a group that caused you a lot of pain. - [Facilitator] Would you like to share what's going on for you when you hear that? I'm just a little overwhelmed. I wanted to know more about how you were affected, if you were affected, by the events at Rhein-Main and my brother's, and the other Americans, U.S.-ers, deaths. What I remember vividly was that there was a controversial discussion in our group, Because there were some people, with whom I didn't agree, they said, that they really found it horrible, to kill someone in order to get their I.D. And so for me the action on the air base was part of a strategy that had already existed for quite a while. That's why I saw the decision by the RAF to take this step, so to speak, to go to another stage of this war... It felt right. I see many things differently today, but I would like to try to explain how it was for me then. My question was, your brother decided to work in the army, be part of a professional army. And one aim of that army is to learn to kill and wage war. And he was confronted with that kind of violence. I mean, my brother was trained for that. If he had really believed it, he wouldn't have just struck up a conversation with a random German person and left with them. In this particular action, it depended on the idea that he would be a young trusting person. That he would not agree with the training that told him to treat everyone like a potential enemy. (News report in German) - [Desireena] Upon our return to the U.S., news broke that three known members of the RAF who had never been caught had been implicated in several robberies in the north of Germany. As I pondered this new development, I received a message from Kathleen's estranged sister, Lisa Marie. She wanted to talk to me about Kathleen and the film I was making. Every now and then, I research Kathleen, 'cause I don't trust the woman. I don't know what she's up to, so every now and then I'll come across a blog of hers, and I came across where she was sitting, I believe in a window, talking about Edward. And a lot of it was fallacy. I was told by somebody very special that what is one person's mindset can be somebody else's not truth. So it could a half truth, it could be an interpretation. It could be a lot of things. Being Edward's older sister and only biological sister, Kathleen being a half-child, I felt that I needed to set the record straight. So I contacted you, 'cause I wanted to know who you were and how you got involved in the issue. (soft music) - [Desireena] Lisa Marie's reputation preceded her. I had never met her, but I remembered how she made Kathleen's life hell back in high school. Now, meeting her in person felt a little like I was betraying my friend. This is the flag from Edward's coffin. It was a beautiful silver coffin, flag-draped. But, his memorial. So after he was buried, this was... After he was buried this was handed to my mom. My mom always wanted to keep this tight in the family, because she was afraid of Edward's murderers. And as I've come to find, they have been released, and Kathleen's perfectly okay with it. Well they did their time. But my mom is still doing her time, 'til the day she died. They're still alive, they're still underground. For the longest time, my mom was in fear of them. - [Desireena] You're still in fear of them. I'm still in fear of them. There is, and still to this day, a guerrilla action. - [Desireena] You think these people were... These people are still part of it. This is just a tidbit. I'm sure there are a lot more cogs in that wheel. My mother, to her deathbed, believed an eye for an eye. At one point in time, her anger and her fury and her frustration of these people getting a 20-year sentence killed her. She wanted these people dead. I don't understand Kathleen's reasoning why she needs to meet these people. They're never gonna tell her why or what the reason was, and that's one of the issues we have, why we are no longer on speaking terms. - [Desireena] If you somehow were able to talk to them and speak to them... I would tell them what they took from my family. - [Desireena] What would you say? They took a nice kind young man and destroyed a mother and her parents, and his siblings, and all the friends who knew him. But there's really not much more to say about it. It's done, it's over, he's a wonderful memory. He will always be a wonderful memory. Edward, where are you? Yeah he's somewhere, up here somewhere, I don't remember. This is sad. (laughs) I got Q8. - [Desireena] Did you find him? No, I found Q8. Edward, come out wherever you is. Here we go, bingo. Long may she wave. That's the reason our boys go to war, to protect her. - [Desireena] Deciding to make Lisa Marie a part of the film presented some issues. Kathleen was not happy. (Kathleen speaking indistinctly) - [Desireena] So I have other questions related to Lisa Marie, and I know it puts you in a difficult situation, because you don't want me to be, the go-between. I've got enough problems without that. But I just have questions. I mean, that's the hard part. This is obviously, like, we could turn my family into a sideshow, we're like a soap opera, you know, with various, and as you've seen, like various hidden things, and things that no one talks about 'cause they're so loaded, and it is a distraction. - [Desireena] From what? From things that actually matter. I mean, it certainly informs my life experience about how we address harm and how we deal with addiction, and how we deal with the truth. Do you think there's a possibility of a different story with Lisa Marie? I will, I mean I hope to never close that door. But that said, I'm not the doormat that one steps on to get through it. - [Desireena] What would it take on your part, in terms of what needs to happen? No more screaming at me, no more threats. No more threats directed at my loved ones. No more telling me you're sticking pins in a doll you've made shaped of me, things like that. Is she still contacting you? Is she still leaving messages? I haven't had any contact in quite a while. Yeah, but I also like, I mean I have some concerns around physical safety, 'cause she is just so unpredictable. I guess for me it's starting to be stark, in terms of like, this huge desire, need on your part to try to meet with people who killed your brother, and it's quite a contrast, right, in terms of, you really don't want to have anything to do with your sister, who is here in New York. I feel like there's really some sort of connection there, right, like... So part of me, and the difference is, is that I know that I care about her. I know that I love her, and I know that I know her and her struggles, and that I have a context for it greater than the hurt. I understand where the two situations seem like, oh, but why are, they're both, they're all people who have done something that's kind of hurtful, so why are they so different? Part of the answer is I have a fuller picture of my sister. So you're you giving these two women the benefit of the doubt because you don't know them? Well I give them the benefit of the doubt to a certain extent. To a certain extent, they're kind of these shadowy outlines of people, and that's what I want to shift. So, it's a chance to see people more fully. What if you could either reconcile with your sister, or reconcile with the people in Germany? But you had to make that choice. Yeah, I don't think that's how it works at all. 'Cause I think part of the trick here is that, I think part of the trick is, we figure out how to reconcile whatever we can, and then it opens doors to figure out how to reconcile on something else. What will it help me to figure out? That could help me then figure out something with this conflict with my sister, which is actually much older. Much older and I have much more responsibility in the conflict with my sister. I know there are places where I've let her down. And I'm sad for it, you know? That she needed me to figure some things out, even with the damaged relationship that we had, she needed me to figure out some things that I could not figure out, and that I could not actually act as her ally when she was desperately in need of one. And it would have been great if we could have figured that out, but we didn't. - [Desireena] Back in Germany, a prominent ex-member of the RAF has agreed to talk, but does not want to be filmed. I'm responsible for having killed, collective, two people. And this is not easy, to live with. - [Kathleen] Some people say, oh, it's bad that your brother died, but the 35 other people killed by the RAF, that was okay. And so I wanted to understand more from your perspective, if you make that same distinction? No, no, no. I don't think that the killing of your brother was wrong and the others was right. No. That's not my opinion. The killing of the embassy, the people employed, was a, you can't make a better society on this basis. By killing hostages. I had doubts. From the beginning. But I felt as a revolutionary, this was the ideology. It was the thinking of that time. Sometimes violence is, is, is, is necessary. - [Kathleen] But here's the thing about violence, is that I don't think that the question of whether a particular act of violence is right or wrong is useful. What I think sometimes is more important is to ask ourselves, are you willing to pay the price, yourself, for what this violence will cost someone else? If you're going to say, like, well I'm doing this and it's right, are you so convinced that it's right that you'll pay to make that other person whole again? You can't explain it a little bit more? - [Kathleen] When people do violence to each other, afterwards, someone needs to clean it up. Someone needs to help someone heal. Similarly with the Red Army Faction, sometimes I think, okay, so you have your reasons, but what are you gonna do then for my mother? Which, it's kind of late now. But my mother carried that burden, probably more than anyone. So, um. What, what, perhaps it's a naive question. What would your mother expect that we do for her? - [Kathleen] Oh I don't think my mother expected anything. But what you do, what you think we... - [Kathleen] My mother was a working class woman. She worked, she came home, she was tired, she went to sleep. She worked as what? - [Kathleen] She was a bartender. She just didn't have any, like she couldn't take time off when my brother died. She had to start going right back to work right away. So she buried my brother and then she was back to work. And she eventually lost that job, maybe six or seven years later. She needed that money. - [Kathleen] She did, but what they said to her when they let her go, was, "You were never the same after your son died." But she never had a regular job after that, for the rest of her life. - [Desireena] With her mom grieving the loss of her only son, Kathleen was having to grow up fast. And I was feeling like I couldn't keep up. I remember it clearly now, the exact moment when we began drifting apart. Walking home through the park, Kathleen blurted out a family secret that we would never speak of again, until now. - [Kathleen] So growing up there was never any father around and I didn't ask very many questions about it. They were just like, he was a bad man, and you're better off without him. And then the night before Eddie's wake, my mom sat me down and she's like, I have something I have to tell you. And I think she just started off by describing her marriage to this man who I thought was my father, and she was like, it was a very brutal marriage. And then she started to see that it had a negative effect on my siblings. And out of concern for them, she realized that she had to leave. She had these two kids, she was living with her parents. She was like, there were all these things happening. It was beginning of the sexual revolution, and I wanted to be in it, and she was working at a hotel. That's what my mother did for actually most of her working life. And one evening she met some man who was traveling through, and he was really interesting, and he asked her to go on a date, so she said yes and she was really excited. But pretty much the start of the date was him forcing her to have sex with him. He raped her, and then she was like, I just have to get out of here. And then within a few months, she realized she was pregnant. You know, what's funny is, later I read in journals about things like restorative justice or transformative justice, and it becomes this fancy concept that people think of, I think. But I'm like, that was actually the first time I really saw it, you know. That my mom was like, I got to choose. I couldn't choose what happened, but I picked you. I picked you and then I decided what sort of relationship I would have with you. And I don't have to minimize what happened and how horrible it was to do that. Both things are possible. - [Desireena] At the beginning of this project, I told myself a story about how Kathleen drifted away after her brother died. Now, I'm realizing what really happened back then. When she revealed to me that she was a child of rape, I was mute; I was ashamed for her. And I was embarrassed for my reaction. And so, I slowly tiptoed away. Now it began to dawn on me, on this latest trip to Germany, the reason I'd been looking for Kathleen since we lost touch after high school. In our final push to find people willing to talk, one woman came forward. Before her meeting with Kathleen, I spoke to Monika, because I was curious to know more about her personal history. My father was in the Nazi Party, and during the denazification he was classified as a so-called follower, But the whole atmosphere when I was growing up, in the crucial development years, it was permeated with fascism and post-fascism. It had always been presented to us as if fascism just fell from the sky and went straight to hell, or vice versa. I never knew where fascism came from. We never heard anything about that. And then I saw: it's built into the system. For me, it was a shattering experience to recognize that the regular institutions that I myself used and took part in, That they were also part of this fascist process. - [Desireena] It was this realization that moved Monika towards revolutionary action. I had always felt I was at a disadvantage, especially as a woman. That I could never truly do what I wanted to do. And in the RAF, with the people there, it was not just about liberation for women, Although it was part of it; it was about liberation in general, and I liked that even better. - [Desireena] Why were you arrested? Well there were several, arrests. The first time. - [Desireena] The first time, yeah. Well there was this apartment, an underground apartment of ours was discovered. The police got wind of it, you know, and we never figured out exactly how that happened. Probably someone ratted us out. - [Desireena] Monika was initially sentenced to 12 years for a bank robbery, but in a daring attempt two years later, she escaped from prison with three other women. Was it easy to escape? We have this saying: "There's no weapon of the enemy's that you cannot turn against them." And it worked very well for us. - [Desireena] Monika was subsequently recaptured, spending a total of 18 years in prison and participating in 10 hunger strikes. In the slammer you're completely powerless you know. With the hunger strikes, you notice that you can have an effect. You're the subject again. Acting, to act on your own, to be the subject, that was very important. Otherwise, in the meantime, you forget, you remain, you start to identify that way. You get used to just being an object, you know. - [Desireena] So it was a way for you to take control of the only thing you could control, right, your body? Yeah, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I think the longest of those was seventy, a little over seventy days. - [Desireena] I can't even imagine what that was like. I can't imagine how it was to not eat for 70 days. It was difficult. (laughs) - [Translator] It's difficult. (Laughter) - [Desireena] That's all you can say about it, right, okay. You are constantly hungry. It's not true that you're no longer hungry after the first week. You are constantly hungry. - [Desireena] What was it that you were trying to achieve with the RAF? You wanted to change the world, correct? It was always clear to us that there will be long and contradictory struggles, And we will try to spark this struggle, to get it going, So that people can rise up, that humanity can rise up, And then, replace what we have now, which is profoundly unjust, with something better. - [Desireena] You know, when I started doing this film, it was hard for me to imagine, deciding to go underground and committing illegal actions in the name of freedom, right? But now we have a fascist president in the U.S., and it's making much more sense to learn from your story. What are the useful ways that you resisted? And what were the mistakes you made? One of the things that I still think about and probably will never stop puzzling over, is how something that was a positive thing at first, in my opinion anyway, and was initiated with the best of intentions, could somehow then change so completely and terribly. I do say there was certainly a lot that I did that was wrong, without question. But of course I always think too, How far can I say to myself that I have erred? And could I have done things better? I mean it's always very hard, it's a continuous process, and it's never completely over. - [Desireena] Perhaps this discussion with Kathleen is part of it, part of the process? Maybe, yes? (laughs) - [Translator] Maybe. I think my curiosity is about how you see your decisions influencing other people, because you're one of the early members, and some people who thought they were following your example killed my brother. And this is exactly the point. Therefore I am responsible, I feel a bit responsible. Even though I wasn't participating and found it wrong. Despite this I want to talk to you, to clarify this. - [Annett] And this is the point, even though I wasn't participating in that, I kind of feel responsible. There is a piece and part of me that feels a little responsible. And that's why I want to talk to you. I want to share things. (speaking in German) Yeah. Uh. Huh. - [Annett] Speak, was there a question or confusion or something? No, I'm like, that's why we should talk. I find it difficult with all of this... Yeah, we might need this to be a little more subtle. - [Desireena] To ease the tension, we moved to a more intimate setting. What I feel very aware of is not wanting to assign responsibility to you that is not yours. And also recognize that you are one of the architects of the thinking that led people to decide it was okay. I was a relatively "small light" as we say, I don't mean to diminish my responsibility, But she shouldn't think I was one of the spokespersons, or prominent leaders. But I never made it a secret, That I do not have regrets, or something. So, yeah, so I just think I want to be clear on two different things and how you see them going together, that on the one hand you have no regrets, but that you also recognize that this group, once you were less active with it, was involved in killing all these different people. Yeah. But you see those as two, those go, how's it, so I'm like, you don't regret that part at all? I can't regret. Regret is not a political concept. Do you understand? It is from morals, from theology, I did what I did. I can say it was wrong. That I can say. But I can't regret it. Then I would negate myself. - [Kathleen] Yeah, Do you understand? Yeah, then there's that, I mean, um. (speaking in German) - [Annett] I mean, I did it, it was me. No matter what, it was me But the politics don't, the politics did not kill my brother. I'm not looking for anyone to renounce the politics. It's frustrating to me, whenever people, when they talk about a murder, are always like, well who's who? Because they want to decide if they agree with the person who did the killing or the person who was killed. It was the same for us. Without wanting to justify that. Many of us felt the same way. I mean, how many of the RAF have been killed? Yeah. A lot of my friends were killed. Yeah. Do you want to say anything else about that? - [Annett] (speaking in German) About that? No. (soft sad music) So I'm curious to understand more about you personally becoming part of the RAF when you were a young woman. But not just like politically, like personally. Why did you want to do it? I really ask for understanding, that I'm not, I talked about this extensively this morning, And I'm really sorry But I don't feel like repeating this all again. Let me think about it. I wanted to kind of start to move towards the harder questions by asking... (speaking in German) - [Annett] And she now says, well why don't you just go ahead with the more difficult questions right away? Okay, um, so, sure, let's try that. So when we were talking yesterday, we were talking about how one thing we had in common was knowing people who had died. So what was your experience like the first time someone you knew who was part of the RAF died? It was awful. I don't know. I can't say much about it. I don't want to spread my emotions here. I don't want to. It was... But we also knew it. We also knew that someone could die. That was absolutely clear. We didn't want it to happen. That was not our intention, that someone, but that was the decision, that this is war and in this war people could die. So, yeah, what else would you like me to know, Monika? 'Cause I can't tell. (chuckles) Do you know what that means? - [Annett] I just want to make sure, and you ask that, because you know she came for a reason, she wanted to share something with you, and you'd rather want her to express what she wants to share? Yeah, and now I've asked her two specific questions and on both, she's kind of basically said I'm not really gonna tell you, so I'm like, I can't tell then what we're here for. I can't think of anything right now. I think, because I wasn't the one who brought up the initiative. It wasn't like I said, "I want to speak about something." I heard she is here, and that she talks about it, And I was asked so I said, "Okay, I'm coming." I also see it as my responsibility to do that. But she initiated. Maybe we're closer to done than I thought. - [Annett] How are you feeling right now? Yeah I mean, uh. More discouraged than I thought. - [Annett] Can I ask you something? - [Kathleen] Mm-hmm. You started off with asking Monika how yesterday was for her, and I don't know, do you still want to share how it was for you? It was harder than I thought to talk with you. It was harder than I thought it would be. Uh huh. Warum? - [Annett] Why? Because we have, we both have a relationship to this action. And so but I think the best way to do it is like, is as partners. But it doesn't quite seem like you are that interested in meeting me halfway. I don't get how you get this impression. I don't get what it's actually about for you, what is it you're trying to, I mean I think on some level, if the thing we have in common is this series of events that are hard, and we want to move forward with those, then we're gonna have to show each other how it's been hard. Show me what here is most real for you, and I will do the same, and then we can start from there. That is too abstract for me. - [Annett] It's too abstract for me. I don't know what I'm supposed to show her. Yeah, I don't know. I mean I think on a base level I can't tell if she really cares. (Sighs) All I can say is that if this thing didn't matter to me, after thirty years, over thirty years, I wouldn't be here. I cannot, I can't start crying here, or know what I, I can't show feelings that I don't have. Or even if I have them I may show my feelings less. I don't like that. It's not for me. For others it's different. Maybe it is helpful for you if I tell you that Most definitely I will be thinking and pondering a lot, about the time we spent together here and, that I may end up with some kind of conclusion, that I can't access just yet. I've been doing this for a while. (speaking in German) I do appreciate people who spoke up against killing him. And I do appreciate that you did that. Wie war das fur dich jetzt zu hören? Gut. - [Annett] It was good to hear. (upbeat music) (speaking in German) - [Desireena] Kathleen's encounter with Monika revealed that no matter how open she tried to be, she still had certain expectations about these dialogues. I mean on some level, it was just confusing. Because I am like, she is not, she was not there. She didn't plan it. But she's connected to it. And there is a way in which it could not have happened without the things that she did years before. With things like the trip to go learn from the PLO. They really were escalating this into the rhetoric of warfare. She herself went to the Middle East. Yeah, and so she created this group. She helped create this mindset, like people thought to themselves, oh, like her, she's given up so much. How am I gonna up the ante from what these people have done? She, you know, they brought a gun to the party, and then yeah, maybe Lutz and his generation of people loaded the gun later. So I mean, you're not gonna change everyone, right? Are you sure? People are not gonna all lay down their arms and say, Wow, this is, I think the idea of, will the norm be different at some point? Yeah, that's what I'm holding out for. I'm holding out for that we return to a more natural default in which people or human beings are not turned into strange political symbols, but that we say first, they are actually human beings. (soft music) - [Desireena] For a long time after high school, I was looking for Kathleen. Now, finally, I know what I wanted to tell her, that I couldn't bring myself to say all those years ago. I'm sorry for your loss. I'm sorry your mother was raped. I'm sorry I walked away from you. - [Kathleen] When people kill each other, I hear the same story over and over again. Someone goes to prison, and then usually what happens is that the surviving family members kind of disappear. And so I just want a different story. I want people to know that there's a different story possible. - [Desireena] I'm still gleaning lessons from my journey with Kathleen. How do we develop compassion for our enemies? When we are attacked and hurt, how do we seek justice without perpetuating harm? With all her limitations and human imperfections, Kathleen continues in her quest for answers. (speaking in German) Have a good weekend. - [Kathleen] Thank you, yes. Danke schön. (soft music)
