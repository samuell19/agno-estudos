- Everyone gets extremely freaked out when you say you're gonna go somewhere and travel. And dance. - I had gone to like California, Texas, some other places. - Texas, Seattle, Portland, and in here. (rock music) ♫ Same dreams built in different city ♫ Road divides for miles in between ♫ This time it's a long walk home Ain't honestly nothing like it. - I figured out what they were doing pretty fast. - You can't have a conversation, you can't do it. - You do have to be a certain type of person to feel like, oh, Guam. Where is that? Okay, let's go. ♫ Even though I may not be ♫ Lost is the art ♫ Of faithful conviction ♫ Too many words lost ♫ In self premonition ♫ I'm a sucker for your heart and soul ♫ But my mind's too young ♫ And my way's too old - I started dancing because you know, I graduated from school, I didn't really have any opportunities. And I kept getting stuck in these really shitty just retail jobs. You know, I got treated like shit. I made shit money. And I just got tired of it. And so I decided to start dancing. I had this long term friend who went to Guam, came back, she loved it. It was a great opportunity for her. She made a lot of money. And she kept bugging me and bugging me to go to Guam. I was like, where the fuck is Guam? - Hello, ladies. My name is Chris Fernandez, and I'm the manager of the world famous Club G Spot. Located on the U.S. tropical island of Guam. And I invite you to come join us. - There were two clubs interested in me. One club was to hire me almost within two weeks. Once I signed all the contracts, then the club buys you a plane ticket to go over and come to Guam. (lively music) - Yup, 100% U.S. American soil. Or rather, sand, that is. Guam has miles and miles of beautiful white sand beaches for you to come play on. You see, if you're living and working on the island of Guam, you're living and working on U.S. soil. Making it a safe destination. - I got off the plane. Picked up by another dancer. And I took a quick nap. And I was scheduled to work that night. And I didn't have any of my make up, any of my stuff. So I immediately walked into the club. And I was told to go straight back to the dressing room and get dressed as quickly as possible. I got in the dressing room and the owner was there. And he took one look at me, looked me up and down. He was like, we need to talk. Drags me to the private room. And tells me, you know, I know who makes money here and who doesn't. And I don't think we really have a place for you here right now. And he basically told me, that he was gonna sell my contract to another club. His bar manager drove me to this other club. They didn't even bother to tell this second club that I was coming. I just was thrown out their door. And the owner couldn't hire me. Had no use for me. So that night, the same night I got driven to a third club. And the first club had driven by, packed up all my stuff, and delivered it at the door. I didn't even have an opportunity to go back and pack up my things. They ended up hiring me. Thank goodness. I don't know what I would've done if they wouldn't have. It's even scary to think about now. Like I really didn't have a place to stay. I didn't have you know, hundreds of dollars saved up just in case, in the bank. I don't know how I would've gotten home. - Hiking, waterfalls, scuba diving, or all sorts of water sports. Or just plain old laying on a beautiful tropical beach. Guam is the perfect destination for any exotic dancer. (light music) - Women have been doing erotic dance since the beginning of women. You know, that story Adam and Eve, Eve was probably a stripper. No. (laughing) I've seen styles change, decade to decade, radically. When I first saw strippers, they had theme costumes and acts. ♫ Put the blame on me - When I started dancing, it was burlesque. It was wine stone jewelry and feathered boas in long gowns, sequin gowns. And capes and like Vegas style. - Of course, porn influenced the stripping business too. A lot. And I saw a certain point dancing getting very boring. (rhythmic music) - In the early 90s, clubs figured out that they could stop paying dancers to work. Stop paying a wage and the dancers would still make enough money in tips to make it worth while. Then they realized that they could start charging dancers. (rhythmic music) - The girls started get really nasty and raunchy on stage. Started doing things like being fully splits with no bottoms on. So I said no, I'm hanging up my g-string for life because there's no way I'm gonna compete with these girls. And they're 19, 18, 20 years old. And they're full doing, fully those things on stage. I just couldn't get my, no. (rhythmic music) - Dancers are classified as independent contractors by the clubs. And in most clubs, dancers actually pay to work. They don't get paid wages at all. They have to pay a house fee. Which can be anything from like maybe $10 a shift. In small like kind of divey bars. To clubs would charge like $300 a shift. And that's all that dancers are paying out before they even start working. The labor violations are pretty intense in the strip club industry. In general. - I've been very involved in prostitutes rights movements since 1975. Trying to decriminalize sex work. To me, definitely stripping is a form of sex work, although I think it's a self identified thing. - Sex work is an umbrella term that is used to describe a lot of different kinds of sexual labor. Including prostitution, stripping, fetish work, porn performing, phone sex work. - Grab your make ups, fix your hair. Prostitutes are everywhere. - A lot of strippers don't like to identify as sex workers. Because stripping is already stigmatized in itself. But there are other strippers who embrace the term sex work. And feel that strippers need to fight for rights and have solidarity with other kinds of sex workers. (upbeat music) - The incentive is, in Guam, you actually get paid a salary. And the salary is $75 a night. So if I go to work, no one shows up, nothing happens, end of the night, I still get $75. - The club usually holds your first three weeks of pay. So girls don't just go there and then lay on the beach and be like, oh, I'm here to not work. You know, thanks for the plane ride. - They take the money for the plane ticket out of your salary. They will give it to you as a bonus once you leave. But a lot of girls never ever complete their three month contract. They get fired, they gain weight. They you know, get depressed out here. And so I haven't heard that happen normally. - There is a base pay. But if the club does not like you, they will watch your every move, and they will fine you. And by the time it's time for you to get paid, your check will be so short, because you've been fined for this, this, that, and that, and just be like, they don't, I don't even know. - If we're late to work, even by a minute, it's a $35 fee. If you know, we're not wearing high heels or something, but there's also a lot of control, a lot of strings that come with that salary that just don't exist in these days. Whatever we make on the stage, we keep. You don't have table dances or lap dances here. You sell drinks. And that's more like the Japanese Asian style thinking. If you like a lady, you buy a lady a drink. And then that lady can keep talking to you. - I honestly seen nothing like it. We didn't sell drinks, we sell private dancers. Or a chair dancers like, I'm sitting here, customers see me walking by, he'd be like, hey, how you doing? And like, he'd be like, bring a dance. That's $10. I stand right there, and I just take my little thong off, take my top, push it over to the side and jiggle jiggle, bend over, jiggle jiggle. Whatever. All right, thank you. You want another one? Okay, thank you, thank you. And then go on to the next. I don't have to sit there, i don't have to touch him. I don't have to ask him what the fuck his name is, 'cause I don't really give a fuck. I don't have to do none of that. You know what I'm saying? He don't wanna know mine, he just wanna see some ass shaking in his face and some pussy. You know? You there, you gotta sit there, what's your kids name, what's your dog name? You know, what's your grandma, uncle, sister name. You went school? Just, I really don't give a fuck, just give me some money. - They're a lot touchy too. So I mean, if they wanna put their arm around you or cuddle with you. Or have you sit in their lap, it's like, now they're getting some of the physicalness with that conversation that creates some kind of intimate level. - What is that? I'm not about to marry you. You know what I'm saying? I'm not about to date you. Out here it's just like, get to know the person. Get 'em to come back. Get 'em to like you. Get 'em infatuated with you. - It's more kind of like being someone's girlfriend for the night. It's expected that you give your good customers your phone number because they want this girlfriend experience. You know, of course you're gonna text 'em. You're like, oh, hey honey, how you doing? Come see me tonight at work. Back in the States, it's like, you strip for freedom. You make your own schedule. They ask you when you wanna work. Here it's like, I always feel like the clubs are like the girls' keepers. (rhythmic music) - The karaoke bar is so, it's a lot better. Like, I sell drinks. I sell private karaoke rooms. I get to dress up. I get to have my diva status going on. I don't have to get sweaty. I smell good all night. My makeup is always intact. My hair is always intact. It's almost more respect there. Like, I'm not taking my clothes off. Everybody's not seeing me for a dollar a nothing. Everybody's not trying to touch me. Guys have bought me like little outfits or something like, I wanna see you wear this. And I've only been there like three weeks, okay? (indistinct talking) - I didn't understand the concept at all at first. But I caught on pretty quickly and no one trained me. And they used to yell at me. And they're like, you sit too long. And you're not getting them to buy you enough drinks, just sit and talk. You need to sit there, get up, walk around, take orders. Sit back down. It's not that it's easy money. But it's not to the point where you're gonna be really uncomfortable. It's just talk, having conversation, if you can't have a conversation, you can't do it. - Now the classy bars, like down in Tumon, like with the tourists, they want you to sit there and just sing an entertain. And just serve them drinks and stuff like that. And you just sit there and look pretty and drink. They're not really egging you on to drink or anything at all. They just want you to sit there and look good. But the other bars, the other karaoke bars, like the local ones, or like the ones that are outside of that district, I would say. It's really sleazy. It's kind of like they wanna touch you. And they are like, pouring their beer in your drink. They don't wanna buy you drink. And it's like, oh man, this is terrible. - There are OFW bars. Which cater to the laborers. And there are engineers too. Sometimes the owners of the businesses. There are bars that cater to expats. Or Americans who work in a civilian sort of way. These are mostly surgeons, doctors, contractors. And of course, they also cater to the G.I.s a little bit too. But the majority of those men go to strip clubs. - When you think of a massage parlor, most people think of prostitution and brothels. While both are illegal, these places are still fully operational. During our special investigation, we attempt to take you behind the closed doors of the red light world. - Massage parlors on Guam basically advertise that they give an array of massages. You know, shiatsu, or what not. And that's it. But when you walk in there, it's a different story. - [Woman] What is this? - [Man] Camera. - [Woman] Oh, camera? - [Man] Yeah. - [Woman] Oh, why? - [Woman] Hello, hi, how are you? - They ask you if you like the special. And then go into details. Here's the prices. Which range between $80 to $200. They're not really trying to hide it 'cause they know that people are aware. - I don't know. Next time we show you. - I was thrown into it so quickly and such a young age. Just enticed by all the material things. - It was so easy to just walk in and just ask them for work. And you just said. Just got a room. We wait until the customers come in. So on that first night, I got a lot of customers kept coming. The further I got into it, the more they become regulars to me. The only thing that I get while I'm there is a place to stay, and whatever I earn, for every 50, 20 goes to her. 30 goes to me. - Isn't it better to freelance? But because the people would just always be there. Sometimes you're not even looking for it, they're looking for you. - Before I knew it, there was people coming around asking me for service or whatever. I'm like, man, this is better than inside. 'Cause I get it all and I make more. So that's how it started for me being outside after that. God was with me. 'Cause I have in my years, I did that for about three years, I think. All together. Massage parlor in and out. Yeah. - I've always been interested in traveling the world. And I thought, you know, why not try and do it? I think I had met a couple of girls. There was one girl in particular. She said, you know, I go to Japan a lot. And I thought that that was so interesting. And she had also done some New Orleans. And I think that got me like researching. Then I knew that one or two people did it. - I traveled when I was in Canada. Bu it would only go to like the smaller towns. They paid better. But the conditions weren't always really good. But you know, you just kind of went with it. You took a bus. It might take 14 hours and then it would be like a dumpy little place and the room would be really bad. You could hear the stage creaking and stuff. And there was like maybe the mail man. I guess there was just something about Japan that intrigued me. And I wanted to go. It was just an amazing life changing experience for me. So when I found that I was passionate about it, I don't think I had ever had a passion for anything before I had gone there. I worked at this casino. And they made the head bunny. And I had the bunny ears with the tail and you had to wear like those little playboy outfits, which was probably, you know, some kind of infringement. The phone kept ringing. And it was girls from Vancouver, they're like, are you still in Japan? I wanna come there and I wanna dance, right? I booked 18 girls. And club owner paid for all their flights. And most of them took off. And another club contacted me and it just kind of snowballed. - So I did live fuck shows in Japan. Interesting, right? (plunky music) - When Guam was released from the classification of top secret, the Guam tourism market took off in 1968. With the development and construction and opening of the Guam Fajita hotel. By my dad, Alfred Israel. The Hilton hotel was constructed and built in 72. From there, other hotels eventually became the development of the Guam tourism market. Now the people who made the money, of course, were the Japanese investors. (rhythmic music) (guns firing) - Japanese tourists think they're coming to America when they come to Guam. Which is surreal. Really, because Guam is not America at all. And like any tourist, they wanna make sure of being taken out of their comfort zone into an exotic place. But with the safety net of having some familiarity. And so yeah, this idea of the rugged myth of an American man. Yeah, they do get to play at that fantasy. And so coming to Guam and being able to participate in sex tourism, for them, helps authenticate the experience of being in America and America as a culture where sex is available. It's an outlet. A place where they can live out fantasies and get out of that conformist culture. Do something naughty. But in the safe space of a non-Japanese environment. (rhythmic music) - The massage parlors have been big since I came back in the 70s. I mean, they were very big in the 70s. They were all up and down Marine Corp drive. They were everywhere. Tourism counts for more than almost 60% of our gross island product, I guess. Or GIP. So it's imperative that we do everything we can to protect it. (slow music) ♫ There we were ♫ Sitting in the sunshine ♫ Waiting for ♫ The clouds to trip the sky - I remember calling my sister and saying, I'm flying to Guam, I'm gonna go dance. She knew I was a dancer. I think I was like 21 at the time. Got on the plane, went there. I was pretty broke. I think I got there with like $5 to my name. And I ended up making like about 15 grand in two months work. Those long hours. But it was quite an experience. And I continue to go back every winter for the next six years. Everyone gets extremely freaked out when you say you're gonna go somewhere and travel. And dance. I think in general, like with, when traveling to other countries, if you're gonna work, there's things you have to look at. Are you gonna get a visa? Are you gonna work there legally? (rock music) - Certainly, the Micronesian women, yeah, they can come in quite easily. It would look like it's legitimate, even though the immigration officer would pretty much know that they were coming in to do something else. There is a lot of imported labor coming into Guam from China, from the Philippines, from Korea. The Philippine government promotes this because they get financial gain. Not only from the money coming back into the country, but also they get some kind of service fee. For actually sending their workers to whichever country. - [Woman] The government officials grade entertainers before they are sent abroad. The government wants to be sure it is shipping out a quality product. - [Helen] It's a very institutionalized program that they have where they actually train women to become dancers, to become domestics. Entertainers. - They're coming down from Seoul all the time. It's no secret. They can come down for 90 days. And they're just gorgeous. And you sit in the airplane and go, oh, oh. And then, then oh, they're going back a few months later pulling four Louis Vuitton bags. And if they were down here on their own free will, I'm not that puritan to say, that I'm opposed to that. - Of course the problem is, that once the women go to these countries, there's very little protection for them. So if they're working under domestic situation, and being told to work seven days a week, they have nobody to complain to. If the wages are given, that are given to them are lower than they were promised. There's nothing they can do. - All the girls that I've met it seems to be like some of them know why they're here. And others are more like, I thought I was just gonna be a hostess. But they just do it. - Even in the strip clubs, when business was better couple years ago, every club used to have actually like one or two buy me drinky girls. They get a set salary, just like a waitress. Their job is to sit there, look pretty. Get guys to stay. And they also get commission on the drinks. - I like to say that we're low rent geishas. Because we all sing. We all dance. And we all pretty much have a standardized way of treating customers. - [Woman] Hi, long time no see. - The bartenders and the waitresses are like over middle age old Korean women. - Everyone calls them the mamasans. Mama, mamasan. And the guys like love interacting with them. Just 'cause it's like the, oh, come on, mama. Come have a drink with us. - You have some mamasans that are really nice. Come and massage you. And you know, culture me into buying a drink. And then you have some mamasans talking about buy the lady one drink. They are ruthless when it comes to making money. And that's one thing I respect about a Korean is that they don't give a fuck. - We usually call 'em in Filipino bars, an ate. Ate is the Filipino word for older sister. The ate is the owner, she's the one that's in charge of the money. And hiring all of that. They look out for their pocketbooks. More than they look out for us. And when the mamas are hurting for money, abuse happens. Pretty serious abuse. I'm talking physical and sexual. And they do not call the police. - They treat the locals pretty well. And I guess because it's our place. These other like, oriental ones, they're very closed up. They're only playful to their customers. - They pretty much keep to themselves. They're not friendly at all. They don't really talk. I mean, they can't speak English. - They would stay inside. And they never really talk much. And I noticed that the mamasan won't every time, the girls are just relaxing. And whatever. She'll come out and just stand right there. - Big deal, you get Thai massage. Thai lady massage. Like a sun and the moon. Mama understand. Yeah. Okay, okay. - Every mama or ate has a way to house. Either in an apartment above the club, usually owned by the mama. Or in a house with one of her other girls. - A lot of Korean women live in the massage parlor. And they can't go out during the daytime either, except to go and eat and shop and then go back to massage parlor and that's it. They live there. - They don't go nowhere. They just stay there. And like, when we ask the mom to go out, we're okay. But when it's them, they can't go. They just, no, you gotta work. - The girls that come here and tours, every girl's housed. Every girl is housed. And they pay for it. - I've done my research with like dancers that wanna go to Europe. Or Scotland, Canada. They do provide housing. In Guam, they used to just take like $40 out of your check every week. The places aren't like phenomenal. But they're not crappy either. They're pretty nice. - It's six girls to a three bedroom house and they put you in a, it's a double bed. But it's like mattresses, twin mattresses, the box spring. And a mattress. And then once you get there, get off the plane, get to the club, they hand you this bag with a sheet. Pillow cases and a key to the house. So it's like, here you go. There's your key, go to work. Be to work at 6:30. Get off at two. You know, whatever. And share room with a girl that you don't even know. - When you get here, it's different. They're not paying for your housing, they're taking the rent out of your paycheck. You can't have visitors. You can't have people come knock at the door. I ended up meeting a military guy and I got reprimanded at work the next night because some girl told on me that I guy knocked on the door. - One of the girls that I was working with was homeless. And the ate got her an apartment. She did not get paid a salary. The only money she ever took home was her tips. And the drinks she made. The mama drove her everywhere. They will offer you so much. But you always have to pay for it double. - It's like military guys, contractors and Japanese and maybe some locals that probably got their income tax. - The Japanese guys, they get really drunk. Sometimes they're forceful. Sometimes they just wanna get naked. - They're going to see like a freak show. But you know. And a carnival. They love pole tricks. The more fancy crazy stuff you can do, the more they love it. - They would go like oppai, oppai. And like slap my titty, and I'd be like, the fuck? - I almost call Guam like, the Tijuana for Japanese tourists. The first club I worked at, they had a deal with all the taxi drivers. They'd, I think, get a little bit of a commission. They definitely ripped the Japanese off. I think they charge 'em usually about $30 just to walk in the door. And they don't charge the Americans at all. - When they come down here, the blonde, blue eyed statuesque American beauty is what they're looking for. When you travel, you want to, the local beer is it worthy? The draft of the area. - [Chris] In addition to tourists, Club G Spot attracts thousands of U.S. military both U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy. - All the military, all the marines, all the air force, the pilots that are coming in. They're not supposed to talk about certain stuff. And after a couple drinks, you know exactly where they're headed. It's very almost like, young jock like fraternity mentality. - [Man] How you doing? Konichiwa. - [Interviewer] What's the name of your ship? Kalaloo. And where is that based out of? San Diego? - I had a 21 year old buy me his first, buy me drinky ever. And he's like $20 for a shot? Are you kidding me? He's like, what do I get out of it? I was like, you get to sit here and talk to me. If you don't wanna talk to me, then leave. - Some of 'em, just the way they would talk to you or treat you, it's just like, you know what? Now I want your money. And other guys just like, aww. You're kind of pathetic. - I kind of wanna hate my customers. I do. I kind of wanna hate them, be like, they're disgusting, they're needy, they grope on me. And then in another way, it's like, I can relate to them. They're like the people I grew up with. They're just really lonely. - [Man] We got a couple more guys leaving the club. - They know that I'm a stripper. And they know that I'm a fantasy. And they know that I'm telling them what they wanna hear. And they don't even care. They just need that kind of release. And everyone just like waits, with like baited breath for the ships to come in. Because the whole island makes bank. - The Americans will come into our bars when they're looking for something a little seedier. Because they think are bars are quite seedy. They want to come in and, they wanna be kings. They're very racist. I mean, they seem to be very racist in a very demeaning sort of way. Like, oh, I've been to Manila. I love Filipino culture. So I'm gonna go to Filipino bars. And I'm gonna drink San Miguel or Red Horse. They just want all the attention. And they want to throw their money. And they want a bunch of little Filipino girls that laugh at them and light their cigarettes. And ... They treat us all very poorly. - [Interviewer] So what were the clients that you would see? - All kinds. All kinds. All different races, all kinds. It was Filipinos, it was Chamaros, there was occasional Japanese tourists, not too many, right? - Hi. - It was everybody. I mean, I was really surprised there was local. There were military guys. There were young guys, there were guys that were older. Older men. - And the strip clubs, you got only guys who go in there, guys who have money, for one thing. In massage parlors, the guys just walk through the door and just have enough money in their pocket to get laid. And maybe tip the girl. - There are so many massage parlors here. That you can go basically get anything you want. Really cheaply. So there's not really a logical reason to go to a strip club. It's more like, because we're so exotic. And rare. You know, as a white woman, I have more of a value. - The sex industry mirrors where our society is. Very much so. The white women are often the biggest money makers in a club. Because they're seen as yeah, more valuable. Generally, just looking like Barbie dolls. Gets you tickets around the world. And can make a good living. - Customer's like so, what are you gonna do for me in a private room? And I'm just like, we'll have a good time. I'll entertain you. And you know, get 'em back there the best way I can without like, incriminating myself for telling him that I'm gonna do this and do something else. - If they ask a question, you can't say yes and you can't say no. So you have to find that maybe. And just play off of that as much as possible. - So sometimes I'll say, I'm gonna fuck you. And then they'll get back there and then they'll be like, I'll say, how does it feel to be fucked? And then he's like, what are you talking about? I'm like, I just fucked you. I just got $300 of your money and I just fucked you. - [Reporter] The beautiful scenery, a precious gift of nature can be found. - Champagne rooms are always around $300. Starting off. But sometimes like with some of the girls, it's gonna be like, it's $400, it's $500. Or it's $350. And then the other girls, oh, maybe it's $200. But you don't get the bottle, you know? - Say, the private room is $100. Money goes to the mama. And then the girl can choose to negotiate further once in the room. Though a lot of the girls on tourist visas don't negotiate very much. - [Tammy] They ring the bell. Hear the bell in our room. - [Woman] Massage? Price one hour 50. - And mamasan calls the ladies to come out. And then we come out, we line up. And then the guy would take a look at us and when he makes his choice, he pays the mamasan. And then I'm given a condom. Then we go into our room. And then from there, once the door is shut, it's up to me, you know? What, how I wanna service him. - If people got bought out here in the States, it would probably pretty much be considered prostitution or be illegal in some way. But in Guam, it's very normal on a lot of the surrounding islands, are like that. - They only let the girls who have been on the island for a little bit do this. And a guy normally takes you out to dinner. Takes you to another bar. Sometimes you go to another strip club. But it's basically like buying a date from a club. - There's one girl that was at Crazy Horse. Her buy outs would be about $500 plus. And her, that 500 would probably be two hours. Some of the other girls that were there, they would let them go for $200 for there hours. - For a $100, they can take a girl out. The girl will get half or 75% or that. And then it's up to her to negotiate further rates outside of the club. - I never wanted to get bought out. Because I feel like, you make more money in the club. And it's just like, girls have told me horror stories where they had to open a door and took and rode us out the car. And have to ditch the customer. - I've tried to do it where I got a deal you know, well, buy me and my girlfriend out. You know, little bit safer. - They're like come on, let's go to the beach. I'm like, what we gonna do on a beach? I don't know, what you wanna do on the beach? Let's go over to my place. I have big screen. I have a ocean view. Once I've seen one guy's government funded apartment with a flat screen and video games and movies and Netflix and shit like that, I've seen them all. You have nothing new that I wanna see. You got some money? You can show me some money. - One of my friends, one of her customers took her to the Philippines recently. And he had to go up to the club owner, ask permission to take one of the girls to the Philippines. And because they knew each other, it was okay. You know, so it's kind of like, they have all these girls, and in some ways, oh, all these girls are here for their very rich friends to also come and have fun with too. It's not quite a pimp relationship. But it's sometimes goes more into that than it does a strip club manager relationship. - [Woman] Here is the list of services that I got from one of the massage parlors today. Pretty innocuous, pretty standard. Until you turn it over, and look at the handwriting on the back. - If you asked, no girl would tell you she's ever tried a trick. However, every girl has turned some form of a trick. - Except for a few cities in Nevada, sex work, prostitution is illegal. And that can be erotic, sensual massage, it could be lap dancing, it could be kissing someone in exchange for a drink. Prostitution is a very broad, broadly defined thing. - In the mainland, there's places where I've danced and as far as you're sitting from me, that's as far as like the customer will get to you. And so it's like, in a sense, I feel like coming out here, this is almost like a forced prostitution in a way. Like, because touching is still prostitution, you know? - [Interviewer] Nobody told you that? - No. - [Interviewer] Did anybody tell you that it was gonna be like that? - No. - So I was told there was light touching. But in Guam, everything is more lax. They're like, put a dollar in stage. The guy expects to be able to get like get to second base and fondle you up. You know? And like the stuff that I would do when I was giving a lap dance back in the States, is what's expected on stage. - Some people will come in the strip club with $6. They will buy them a beer, tip you $1 and be like ... And you got his one girl that likes to pick up that $1 that they got for it off their face with her pussy. Bitch. Made it so hard for me. - I don't know if I would've came out here if would've known it was as full contact as it was. Customers push. Like, a girl would have her back end to a customer. I saw one guy like put his finger in her. And the bouncers don't do anything about it. And eventually I started drinking more 'cause I couldn't handle the physical touching. - It's really isolating. And if you're stripping for a hot military guys for the most part, a lot of the girls are like, well fuck it. I wanna sleep with 'em anyways. Why not make some money? It's kind of assumed that we're all prostitutes, you know? Oh, it's a white girl in Guam. They're either military wife or a fucking whore stripper. - I fee like you can't draw this line between strippers and prostitutes. Women are working in strip clubs and they need to make their rent. And people do what they have to do to make money. But I think it's really counter productive to have all these like, advocates for strippers saying, we just need to like, get rid of all the prostitutes. Obviously, that is gonna cause problems who are doing illegal sex work. Who just kind of want to stay under the radar and make money how they can. This debate just goes on and on among dancers and among sex worker activists. - When it comes to admitting it, and protecting us a little bit more, they don't want anything to do with that. They just wanna make sure no one gets AIDS, chlamydia, gonorrhea, whatever. - The massage parlors mamas have patented the girls in a way, after you've worked all night long, and I remember you start work at 7:30, 8 o'clock in the evening. You're awake all the way 'til sunrise. Which is six, 6:30 here. Then after that, you have to go to public health to get tested. Do the HIV test, do AIDS test, STD tested you. And all that kind of stuff. Swab your throat, your mouth, all that stuff. But yeah, that was a requirement to having that job. You had to have a accurate up to date health certificate. At all times. (slow music) - The hotel and restaurant association with visitors bureau, we thought it was best that we try to establish a red light district. But the only problem was, was then the mayors throughout the island were saying, you know, in very nimby fashion, well, not in my back yard. My colleagues all just, all backed off. And even though visitors bureau, and the hotel and restaurant association didn't produce the support they said they were gonna give me. So the bill just died in committee. They all got sidetracked when the archbishop decided that he was gonna holler and scream about you know, the thought that we are recognizing and legitimizing prostitution. - The government makes money through taxes. And if they start to shut down the activities that are kind of swept under the carpet, they're gonna lose revenue. It's the secret that isn't a secret. - What vice cop doesn't wanna hang out in a strip bar? You know, millions of dollars have been spent by undercover officers in strip bars. - Every ate, every mama has a police friend. - They buy out the cops a lot. - I had a lot of cops come into my place. - The girls that come here, as trafficked women on tourist visas, I can go to the police if I needed to. They cannot go to the police. What will they say? I came here illegally to do sex work? - And it's so cruel to be flirting with these women, giving them money, having a good time, and then to turn around and bust 'em. The government makes a lot of money. Going undercover, and busting women. The government's the biggest pimp. And sometimes the cruelest. - There's organizations and NGOs that are formed. - They're trying. - Coalitions and those kind of thing. But I don't think that they know where to start. Or everybody's kind of fumbling in the dark. - If they are foreigners, I think that perhaps the attitude is, let's take care of our own. Because the prostitution that goes on in the massage parlors is not acknowledged, there's very little protection for those women. - There are arguments between different factions of feminists. Some of whom see stripping as always like exploitation of women. And others who kind of take a more nuanced position. And are more focused on looking at labor rights issues and dealing with exploitation as it occurs in different situations. And take more kind of harm reduction approach. - Harm reduction is a great model for helping. Rather than trying to shut down strip clubs or tell women, you're totally being victimized here. Get out immediately, we'll train you to be a secretary. (rock music) - The current set up of the clubs provides flexibility for a lot of women. That wouldn't necessarily be there if the whole club industry was moved above ground and everything was on the books. ♫ I wear the veil ♫ Just to say I'm well ♫ No talk was cheap ♫ No thrills for free ♫ No game is fun ♫ Unless it gets you down I think that the best way to make things better is to put a lot of information out there about if and how the club owners are breaking the law and what they can do about it. Rather than kind of going on a big campaign to say, like, everyone needs to be employees and we all need to be working like with contracts. And get paid a wage. Because different things work for different people. (rock music) ♫ I walked into ♫ A crowded room ♫ No one is talking ♫ They're only here to you ♫ All chop was cheap ♫ No thrills for free - I wish our government would do something to protect us better. I wish that I could go to the police and be taken seriously. Instead of being treated like, like someone who asked for it. - It's not Guam, or Guam's fault. It's just, these are problems women have to face in other parts of the world that we don't necessarily think of in the U.S. 'Cause United States isn't the world, you know? ♫ I'll love you forever (slow music) - Wanna hear about an awesome trick I learned? One of my highlight awesome trick out of all of them? - [Interviewer] I'm always up for an awesome trick. - Okay. I worked in Cosmo, this strip club. And this waitress told me that she knew this guy that wanted to pay her $500 for a date. But he didn't wanna have sex with her. He didn't want any physical contact with her at all. All he wanted her to do was tie him to a bed and leave him there. His big thing is, when the meat cart goes down the hall it goes (rattling). Down the hallway. Then they knocks on the door. Hello, maid service, maid service. And they jiggle the door knob. And keep knocking, maid service, right? His big thing is, maid coming in, catching him. (screaming) And running out the door, right? So she told me about this guy. So I set up to meet this guy at a club. We had two drinks together. I said I'll tell you what, pay me $1000 cash. And I'll give you the experience of a lifetime. So I'm thinking all the time, how am I gonna earn this money the best way I know possible? This was a no sex customer. This is a guy with a fetish, okay? Big difference. Big deal is, you go in a room with a guy, you know what he wants, he wants head, he wants to fuck. Big difference when you go with a guy that has a fetish, you have to know exactly what he wants. So met this guy, had a couple drinks. So he sends his little boy onto my door, lived up here 20 years ago. The same apartment complex. This guy's got a white shirt, tie. He couldn't have been more than 20, 21. Real officer looking kind of boy, right? Clean cut, all that, cleanly shaved. He hands me an envelope, are you so and so? Yeah. Hands me an envelop with ten 100 new, never been folded $100 bills in it. And the hotel name and room number. So it was at Hilton hotel. The bridal suite. Which is a big huge room with these big huge glass doors overlooking the ocean. Really beautiful. So I got the money that evening. The next evening, I was supposed to meet him, right? So I'm thinking, how can I make this really an experience for this guy, right? So I went down to the hardware store and I bought 24 feet of big huge link chain, right? And two big gigantic padlocks. Big heavy duty, the kind you have a hard time getting out padlock, right? So we make an arrangement for a certain at this hotel. So I walk into the hotel, I go to the room. He leaves the door unlocked, I go in the door. I told him to sit on the bed facing the sliding glass doors. And just sit there naked. Just don't move, just sit there, I'll be there exactly at such and such time. I got there exactly three minutes 'til the time. Got to the room exactly right on the dot, on time. I open the door. I walk in the room, I put a blindfold on the guy. I go around him, I handcuff him. I drag him to the freaking toilet and I chained his ass to that toilet. I degraded him, I slapped him around, kicked him, not really hard or anything. Took red lipstick wrote all over his body, right? Okay, and I left. About 30 minutes worth of work. 1000 bucks, not bad, right? So I knew this guy that owned Fred's locksmith was this little tiny locksmith place here on Guam. So I'm running around the next morning 'cause I know they're not gonna find him 'til the next morning. He's in his room by himself, the maid's not gonna come until the next morning. So I'm going, that day, I was on a flight to go to California. See my family for the summer. It was during the summer time, right? So I drove around the park and I'm going, what happened to this guy? I'm freaking out. This guy gonna turn me in? He's gonna say, oh, I met this blonde stripper at such and such a club. This and that. Either that he's gonna describe to the cops, I'm gonna be in all kinds of trouble. And I'm stressing so bad about this guy turning me into the authorities or whatever, right? So you could see the opening of Hilton hotel, there's this big huge, I don't know what you call it, patio, balcony, lobby? Lobby area. It's all see through, you know? You can see through it, right? So I see these guys running around with these big old gigantic walkie talkies. These big six foot, hey boys, I mean they're big guys. None of them are under six foot. Six foot two, big big big guys. Running around, they're running around, running around. I see a note that says, Fred's locksmith try to pull up. Oh shit. I know it's about that guy, gotta be. How are they gonna get him out of those chains, right? I locked him up good, girl. So they couldn't get him out of the chains of course. They had to call a locksmith to get off the padlocks. They had no way of getting this guy's padlocks. So I see Fred's locksmith truck leave. I gotta be at the airport in less than two hours, right? So. So I go to the locksmith's shop, I see his truck pull in, it was down here in 20. I was in Tumonts, I had to drive down, right? So I see him get out of his truck, go inside, I thought, I'm gonna go see, see when he gets some keys on my key chain. So I go in, I say, hi, Fred, how you doing? Oh, man, you're not gonna believe what's happened to me. I just got a call at the Hilton hotel. Somebody chained this guy to the bridal suite hotel toilet and left him there. And when I got there, there was white spots all over the floor, looked like cum. Guy's butt ass just cum all over the damn floor. The guy got all kinds over that shit, right? So he's telling me the whole story. Whole time, I'm wanting to laugh so bad I could hardly even keep from laughing. I'm going like this. Just keep from laughing 'cause he's telling me the story, I wanted to laugh so bad, right? But I didn't wanna be a dead give away, either, right? But that was one of the highlight tricks of my whole hooking career, because I made 1000 bucks in less than 30 minutes. Way less than 30 minutes. And I was in and out on a flight the next day to go to California. Oh no, two hours after that, to go to California. Thousand bucks. - [Interviewer] That's pretty amazing. - That's pretty cool, yeah.
