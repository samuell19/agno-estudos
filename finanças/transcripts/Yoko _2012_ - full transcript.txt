I would like to tell you a story. Here above in Tibet, we believe that, through study and meditation, the world can be changed. It's the highest of all arts, to create a being from pure thought. The last one to achieve this was a boy of your age. He created a Yeti who lives above us in the mountains. We honour this creature, and do you know why? A Yeti is a protective spirit for animals and children... But master, do Yetis really exist? Lhapka, there is so much more inside you than you know. Wonderful things. Worlds. Unimaginable powers. In there?! There you will find them, Lhapka. Why haven't I never seen him? A Yeti does not show himself to everyone. He's careful to stay invisible. You will not see a Yeti until you really need him. But wait... ...I can feel, that a creature is seeking the help of the Yeti... ...very close to our monastery. Shut up, fleabag! Great bear... Like in old times, man against beast. Where do you still find that today? Right, Trixie? Okay, the tiger in Jaipur wasn't so bad either! Too bad that ultimately, nobody wanted the damn thing! Because of the "species-appropriate keeping of animals!" Nothing but lukewarm wimps in the zoos these days! Except Kellermann. That guy's okay. His mouth will be watering when he sees that glorious bear we caught for him! Shut up! Drop it! Bedside rug! Bear piss! Dammit... Dammit! What's going on in here? Do you want a second round? See, Trixie? That's how you handle a bear. Hi, daddy. I got an "A" today. In geography. Are you happy? It's snowing today. And 12 months, two weeks and four days ago today you played the Tibetan song for me for the last time. Do you remember? Pia? Are you there? Do you want to go for a spin, like we used to? Or does the lady need some peace and quiet once again? Hey, you're there! - Give it to me! - Come and get it! Give it! Lukas! - Please! - Go ahead, come on! Are you nuts? That really hurt! I'll get you a new one. You can't just buy it! It's something special! Everything's special to you lately! You've gotten so conceited! It was my dad's. So, final stop, my friends. Welcome to Germany! Poor little animals... The dreary life in a zoo's cage is waiting for you! Or you'll end up in an experimental laboratory! Some of you might even become fur coats... What's going on here?! Nobody escapes van Sneider's traps. Holy bear piss...! Now look who's here...! All right then. Let's make two boxes, one for stuff that goes away, and one for keepsakes. It's only been a year since dad died. Pia... Dad would have wanted that, too. And I want my own room! - Dad's shades! Aren't they cool? - Mega cool. - This is so not cool at all, give them to me! - Let her have them, please. Katja's Feelgood Travels, hello? Give them to me! Give them to me! - Listen, everything remains as it is! - Mom!! Soon you'll be as good as new, my beauty. Neither age nor sickness will leave ugly marks on you. And not even death can separate us then. Dammit! Kellermann! You again, van Sneider! You're disturbing me! All right, I'm coming. But your surprise better be a surprise to me! Idiot. Well? Would you like some coffee or whisky, Mr. Zoo Director? Let's get down to business, van Sneider. What do you have? I'm really curious about your opinion. This is a Tibetan black-eared mountain hare, very rare on the fur market. It'll be pretty once it's stuffed. Over here... ...an Asian long-bearded pygmy goat. Not one stuffed specimen in Europe so far. Are you interested? I buy that. A llama from the Himalayas. Or here! The white-eyed bear! - Whatever. Anything else? - Yeah... All right, let's get to the ultimate sensation. I don't know if you're interested, but it's the legendary, never-before-seen... - What is this, a joke? - Excuse me? But what... Impossible! He has to be in here! Stop acting up, Sneider. That was the Yeti, dammit. Do you know what that means? I caught the Yeti! He won't get far. Where are you, you fleabag?! A Yeti... That would be a sensation. That would make me world-famous. Lukas? Is that you? Very funny, Lukas. Lukas? It was huge, and it looked utterly dangerous! - It's probably just a marten. - It grunted! I'm not going out there, Pia, I just need some relaxation right now. - What's going on? - There's a monster in our garden! Cool! Let's go hunting for monsters, okay? Oh please, mom! All right, get out, you monsters! Watch out, you wicked monster, I'm coming for you! - Well? Any monster contact? - No, there's nothing here. Absolutely nothing, let's go back inside. - But I saw it! - You shouldn't lie. Shut up, I'm not lying! Be peaceful, girls, you know we have to stick together. Leave me alone! - Stupid cow! - You're stupid! Wait for me! The Yeti. Fascinating. "A shy, extremely rare creature." "Can make himself invisible when in danger, but needs coldness to do so." "Dip in ice-cold liquid oxygen to verify the identity." It's gone. Indeed a Yeti. I have to get him! "Pedigree dog missing", that's humiliating! I'm a hunter, not a sticker freak! In the wild, this would all be over in an hour: Stalk, buffle... Bingo! Can't you read? No bill-sticking! We keep our neighborhood clean, my friend! - Now get lost with your rubbish! - Weirdo... Marcella? Are you afraid the sausage will run away? Here. The man said that I'll get 5000 Euro for that dog. That much? For a dog? I want to keep it anyway. Hey! Have you seen the soy sausages? Noooo... Thanks for the info. Soy sausages... Do you think the dog will like them? If mom sees that, she'll get really mad. You ruined my tree house! And you stole my MP3 player! And to top it all, you're admitting it? You understand me?! Can you say something else than "YO"? And what else? Are you still thirsty? Stay here, I'll get you some more water. Oh man, you scared me! Who or what are you anyway? You don't really look like a dog. Hey! You can't stay here. You better scoot before somebody finds you. Are you okay? That's just a freezer. Pia! Is everything okay? Yeah, I'm coming! Did you just scream? It was just a spider. Do you want to store that in the basement? Yes. I thought I'd carry dad's stuff downstairs. I'll take it. - Can you take that, too? - Mom and me are going to paint my new room today! That's dad's room! What was that? - Nothing. - You are hiding the dog! Dog? You want the reward, admit it! - Prove it! - No, YOU prove it! - Wait, stop! - What dog? No, YOU stop! Doggy! Are you hiding here? What dog? He ran away from his owner. Pia? Are you all right? Oh it's so hot in here! Hot? Doggy! - And where is that dog now? - Doggy! - Are you in the washing machine? - Pia! I opened the door... so he can get out. You can't let him run away like that, somebody must be looking for him! Dad always said: "Keeping of animals only benefits us, not the animals." But I really wanted to have that doggy! You're really mean! Hey, don't be so sore! Come on, let's paint your wall. In pink! The cupboards, the walls... Are you nuts? Do you have any idea what would have happened if they had found you here? Yo, you Yoko... You ate the whole deep-frozen stuff? And you're not freezing in there? Come on, Yoko. I'll take you home. Hopefully, we'll find out there who or what you really are. So this is your home. You don't seem to be too happy... Wait. I just look around. This is van Sneider. Your offer, Mr. Zoo Director, or I'll go somewhere else. That's too little, far too little, director. What? No, it's not about me getting the Yeti, it's about you getting the him. You're a Yeti! Hey, you snotty brat! He's mine! That was close! Yoko? Yoko! Yoko! Gotcha! Slowly, pal. Well, well, well... It's you again! Yoko? Are you there?! Master! Master! Master! I found the Yeti, Master! During my meditation, I heard that sound and a lot of stars popped up! And suddenly, he was with me! In here! That is wonderful. Hold onto him tightly. There's something wrong with the Yeti, master! We have to find him! We have to help him! Come. I have something to show you. Don't worry so much about the Yeti, Lhapka. Possibly he is just a bit busy at the moment. Protecting a child. Or helping an animal in danger. You just need to worry about a Yeti, if he gets too hot. But that cannot happen high up here in the cold mountains of Tibet? It was you, wasn't it, Master? That little boy? You created the Yeti! It melts. That's a bad sign. You were right, Lhapka. Something's happened to him. Have you seen my new room yet? Everything's gonna be pink! Pink chairs, pink table, pink cupboards... Pink! What is it? - You'll eat some salad, too. - Okay, but not that much. Is that all you're eating? Have you thought of a birthday wish yet? Yes. I want it to be canceled. Would you stop smacking, Marcella? Why don't you invite some of your classmates? I am not keen on them... ...and they are not keen on me, either. There's a... - There flies a... - What? Nothing. You've buried yourself for one year, Pia. You have to socialize again. I mean... - At least give it a try. - No... Pia? Uh, yes. Sure. Have you seen the doggy again? Pia! Pia! I'm freezing, you too? - No. - Yes. You can make yourself invisible! This is... Unbelievable! Awesome! How do you do that? Show me again, please! That is mega cool! So actually, you're still here. I just can't see you. Never mind. It's okay. That's impossible! Yoko from the Himalayas... You're not running away again, are you? You're staying with me forever, okay? Promise? Pia! Come on, we're running late! You stay in here till I come home from school. Watch out! Pia! Promise you won't make a mess again, or I'll be in real trouble. It would be best if you turned yourself invisible, just in case. Man, you sure are incredibly stupid. What on earth did you do in a fish counter? I'm a hunter, I hunt. But you have no idea where the Yeti and the girl are right now. Am I right? Of course I know where the Yeti is! It's all here, it's all in here! I'm dying of suspense. - Well... - Take that map down, you idiot. That's my favorite bear. Well? - Where's the Yeti and where's your plan? - The plan? Oh, you mean THAT plan! Find the girl, get the better of the Yeti, okay? Then he's mine. He's mine. - That Yeti is for me! - That's a minor matter. The most important thing is: Where do little girls stay? I'll tell you were: at school! S-c-h-o-o-I. There are three schools here: a boys' school, a tree nursery, so... ...she can only be right here. I will got to that school and ask the children where she lives. Simple, yet brilliant. Why on earth would a child want to talk to you? I'm a master of disguise... sorry. I blend into my environment. Pia! Stop! Hi. Hi. I've been waiting for you. Gym class was cancelled. So? Here. I fixed it. You can barely see the crack anymore. I didn't know it was your dad's. I'm sorry. Thanks. Would you like to... Look, there's an ice cream stand. How about some chocolate and strawberry? Do you have passion fruit? Passion fruit? I don't have no passion fruit! How about chocolate? I don't have chocolate, I don't have passion fruit, I don't have any ice cream whatsoever! Where are they?! Everybody laughed at me, just because I was the last one who handed in the paper. Van Sneider... Hey! What's all this crap? Stay here! He must not find us! That's enough, Pia, cut it out! - We wanted to have some ice cream! - There is no ice cream! He's no iceman, he's an animal hunter! - And he's gunning for me! - My ass, Pia! Lukas! Please don't go! One scoop of chocolate, please! - Excuse me, do you have ice cream? - Hey, get in line! Are you crazy? Get lost! Beat it, there is no ice cream! Of course I have ice cream, really good ice cream! Great. - I'll have one scoop of chocolate... - ...and strawberry? It's free. Listen... didn't you come out with a girl? That girl... where does she live? About this height? Brown hair up to here? - Rides a mountain bike with colorful flags on it? - Yes, that's her. Don't know her. Yoko? Please come here for a moment, Pia. Why? Why what? Why did you do that? Do you want to stop Marcella from moving into dad's room? Nonsense, I didn't do anything! Nothing? And this happened on its own? Do you think this is easy for me? Working at the travel agency every day? Being nice to the clients, no matter what? Always trying to do everything right? I miss your dad, too. At least talk to me! I'm sorry, mom. I'll make it up to you, okay? I have to go to the store, Pia! - I'm taking Marcella with me! - Okay! You can make yourself visible, I'm not mad at you. But you'll remove all the paw prints! Today, the Neuburg zoo welcomes a very special new acquisition. A precious specimen of a threatened species arrived from the Himalayas: A Tibetan white-eyed bear. - This bear species is protected, - What's wrong with you? ...and our zoo is the first one in Europe who owns a Tibetan white-eyed bear. Where are you going? To the zoo? Wait! Pest control! Brilliant! A brilliant cover! Right, Trixie? The little brat will never get that! And... Bingo! I got her. Oh snap, it's van Sneider again! Stalk, baffle... and Bingo! At any rate, you have to stay invisible right now! Got it? Yoko? Take my hand and don't let go, okay? One student, please. Wait, girl! Your student ID! What's up? No, Yoko! Wait, no! The bear house... Open up! Or I'll have Yeti roast and child burgers! - Here! You have to cool down. - Open up! Where is he? I won't ask again! Well? Where's the Yeti? You better tell me right now. And if I don't? You don't wanna know. Pia Paul. 10 years old. Interesting... I will not ask again. Where's the Yeti? A Yeti? I thought that's just a fairy tale. Van Sneider? Do you know that incredibly painful rib-breaker grip? On the count of three. One... Two... Three. Yoko! Duck shit! Bear piss! Interesting... He's still here... but he's invisible. Who? The Yeti, you idiot! Leap at everything that moves. Yoko! Wow, that was awesome! Yoko, you're great! I'm sorry, daddy. I always feel guilty when I'm happy. Books!? Do you live here? You can play it! Only my dad could do that. That was totally crazy! How did you do that? I see... Yoko-loco, right? We're back! Get down! Hi Pia! - This is super duper mega great! - Do you like it? Thank you, Pia! Thanks, Pia. That's really beautiful! You're welcome. - I'm going to bed. - Already? I'll get you some cocoa. Dog paws... I knew it! Pia? Have you seen the thermometer? No! This will help. Open your mouth. - What's wrong with you? - Mumps! We'll go to the doctor's later. I thought I got you girls vaccinated. You did! You're coming with me, you're running late. - And I can leave you all alone here? - Sure. Okay, get well soon. - Thanks, Pia. - Bye, sweetie! If there's a dog somewhere, I'll find it! Doggy! Doggy! Rover! Mr. Bow-Wow? Mr. Bow-Wow...? I know you're there! Don't be afraid... Gotcha! You're not an ordinary dog... Hello. How can I help you? Kellermann. I'll get straight to the point, it's a matter of life and death. Your daughter Pia has abducted a zoo animal. - That animal is dangerous. - I don't believe that. Do you want a disaster to happen? Master! What shall we do without you? Please stay with us! When a friend needs help, you have to go. You understand that. Can't I come with you, Master? You look after everything while I'm gone. Can you do that for me, Lhapka? Ladies and gentlemen! You're about to watch a show of Circus Paul! And first of all, you'll see the lion! Jump! Good job! And again! And now the flip! 1... 2... 3... And... jump! Great, Mr. Bow-Wow! Ladies and gentlemen, applause for the lion! And here comes the seal! And... go! Great, Mr. Bow-Wow! Keep going! Yeah! Yeah, keep going! What's up, Mr. Bow-Wow? What's that? What is that thing?! Shit! What's going on here?! Yeti out or I'll give you beans! Get down! Come on! Drat! Where the hell is Pia?! Lukas Hausner. You, Marcella? No, Pia is... What?! - What's up? - Marcella just called me. - You? - Yes, she said a man with a gun is sneaking around your house. - Oh my god! - Allegedly, he's after your dog. What's going on here? First the fake iceman, now the hunter... - And since when do you have a dog? - I'll tell you later! - Do you help me? - Sure, if the lady needs me... Dude, just come with me, okay?! - There are no Yetis! - Yes, there are! And this Sneider wants to catch mine! - Thank you, Mr. Schecker! - It's all right, I know this guy. And the two of us - we're gonna have a nice, little chat... Let me down! Let me down!! If you're kidding me, that's it. Once and for all, okay? A Yeti, I can't believe it! - What about van Sneider? - Van what? The hunter, I thought you were in danger! Oh, HIM. He's -- Yoko! Damn... We need ice, hurry! I'm sorry. But after the hunter was gone, I really wanted to do something funny with Mr. Bow-Wow... - Yoko mustn't get too hot! - But his name is Mr. Bow-Wow! I found nothing but a mudpack and some ice cubes. The tide's out in your freezer. - Wow, he's so hot, that he's steaming! - That's why he needs ice. It would be best if you got back home soon. Right, fatty? Nonsense. This is his home! You just heard him. He always says "yo". He's a Yeti, he lives in the ice. And we're in midsummer. And didn't you tell me that there's a madman out there hunting him? WAS, not is. Yoko is my friend, and you don't put a friend in a box and write "sender: Pia, address: Himalayas" on it! I didn't say that! We just have to think about what we're doing with him. Why "we"? He's mine! He's not yours, he doesn't belong to anybody. - Get lost if you don't like it! - Fine, I'll go. Stupid cow... You... you... Nitwit! Folks! There's a stormtroop of zoo guys on the way! Make yourself invisible, Yoko! Damn, he's too hot! We need a hideout! Hurry! Open up! Open up! Come on, the coast is clear! Hey! Open the door at once! Pia! Please open the door! Pia! Mom! What are you doing here with these guys? And what are YOU doing here? Why aren't you at school? Math was cancelled. - Mrs. Schneider is sick, she has... - Mumps! Where is he? Let's check outside. Mom, you have to send these people away! They're evil... Please Pia, this is an extremely rare animal, and Mr. Kellermann thinks it's very dangerous! He isn't an animal, he's a Yeti! An he's the dearest being in the whole world. Stop - stand still! Hello! It's me! Get me down!! Yoko! - Please say something, Yoko! - He's gonna be fine. No! You can't do that, let me through! No! Yoko... That's enough. Let go of me, you murderer! Are you crazy?! Let go off my child right now! Don't let him take Yoko, mom! He wants to stuff him! You're friend isn't well, Pia. They can take better care of him. Pia! Pia, wait! Stop, missy! You stay here! I thought you had mumps? Oh mom...! - Can't we take a quick look? - Please! I'm sorry, it's 5 p.m. That's it for today. Drat! Let's go to the rear entrance! The coast is clear. Come on! Come on! In there, they're stuffing the animals! Damn, there's a hook! - Here, try this. - Thanks. That's the pits...! We have to get to Yoko, or he'll be next! Shush, I can hear somebody! Let's go! 112.1 degrees Fahrenheit. My God, he's so hot. I don't think he'll make it. No reflexes. Respiration hardly perceivable. He's as good as dead. Pity though. I guess that means stuffing... Oh well... At least a small sensation, too. Okay, guys. Let's call it a day! Yoko! Yoko! You can't die, Yoko! You can go back home! I'll let you go! After all, I got that you can't live here! Please... Please... Don't die. Yoko? He's alive! Yoko! We have to get him out of here! Someplace cool! Quickly! Every zoo has a cold storage, we'll take him there! Excuse me, is Pia with you? Oh, Lukas isn't home? Hold on! No, it's okay. Thanks. Thank you, bye. I don't mean to disturb you. I'm looking for my Yeti. He isn't here, by any chance? What are the three most important characteristics of a successful hunter?! Disguise, disguise... Disguise. Baffle, stalk... Bingo! The cold storage must be somewhere over there! - There you are! - What are you doing here?! I followed you on my scooter! And then I ran around until I discovered a hole in the fence. I even thought of bringing supplies! Look, up there in the tree, there's a huge monkey! That's van Sneider! What now?! Why do I play baseball? I don't have time for this! To the cold storage, hurry! I can't right now. What the hell is that...?! A slaughterhouse?! No, it's the zoo's fridge. You'll feel better in no time, Yoko. Hurry! Van Sneider will show up here! And probably soon! We have to be prepared. Any suggestions? - We set up a trap! - What kind of trap? Something with... ice? Ouch! If you think you could deceive van Sneider, you thought wrong! Hello kids! Let's have some Yeti roast! Bear piss, kingfisher poop, I'll floor you, your last dance you dance with me you dust mop... I'll turn you into shish kebab! Shut up, you monkey! Wait a sec, I'll teach you some table manners! Mouse-puss! Great, Marcella! One last round! Marcella! The party is over, kids. The Yeti for the little princess! Let go of me, you monkey! Stop! Just you wait, you! Anything you can do, I can do better! Good riddance! Blow, Yoko! What's happening?! My knees...! My hands... I c-can't m-move anymore...! You plague-spots! Cat lickers! Looks pretty apishly... Almost like a Yeti! By the way, where's Yoko? - Yoko! - Yoko! Gotcha. How do you do that? How do you talk to him? Yes... I want that, too. That's what I always dreamed of... Yoko?! Yoko! That pig Kellermann got him, for sure! Look at that! This is not happening! Let me sum up: The seals' tank needs to be cleaned. The lion... The lion suffers from toothache. Why didn't I notice that? The elephant... ...doesn't like bananas. Zebra and rhino can't stand each other and don't want to share a compound anymore. I will adjust the zoo again. I promise. Let go of him now! Pia. I don't understand what happened, but our little friend here... He has opened my eyes. I felt wonderfully light, everything turned white, and then... Everything was completely different than it was before. Did he fly with you? To a very distant country? Yes. You could say that... Get me out of here! That's my Yeti! What's that? Did van Sneider cause you any trouble? No! Not really. But you two work together, don't you? You and van Sneider, I mean. That's over. From now on, things are gonna change around here, kids. I promise. And your stuffed animals? You know... I wanted to have all my favorites from the zoo around me even after death. But it's the living animals that need you, and not the dead ones. You're right, Pia. I must have lost sight of that. - Kids! - Mom! I was so worried! - Are you still mad at me? - Nonsense! But what about Yoko? He can't stay here. Come with me. There's someone waiting outside who traveled a long way to see Yoko. What's that? Mr. Lobsang is a famous monk from Tibet. Your Yoko has already been missed there. It is for me a great honour! You must be a very special girl. You found a Yeti! Well... Actually, Yoko found me. Do you take him with you now? If you would permit it? Yoko... This is for you. Aside from my dad, you're the only one who can play it. Will we ever meet again? You always say that. So long, Yoko. Who's coming to your party? Oh, no one special... Just some of my classmates. No one special? Hard to believe, lady! Hey, dummy. Great that you're here! Ta-dah, your cake! - Do you pull it up? - Of course! Enjoy! Do you know what my mom gives me for my birthday? - A trip to Tibet! - Cool! We'll go there during the winter holidays. Want to come? Master, master! Look! Footprints. He's back. The Yeti is back!
