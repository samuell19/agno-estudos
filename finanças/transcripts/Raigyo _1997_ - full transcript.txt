The nurse confirmed that you got back to the hospitaI just after eight I had time untiI the next bus. I got on a train that had just come in... and went to Tokyo,... ..then came straight back again. What did you do that for? I just wanted to go somewhere. Because Mr Tanabe had... ..ditched you? You were introduced to Mr Tanabe in May 1 982 by a friend. You went out with him for four years, but broke up when you were hospitaIised for a hernia and pancreas disorder. You met and married your current husband Mr Takahara in January 1 987.

You came to the petroI station. The poIice asked me to identify you just now. How does it feeI to kiII someone? Do whatever you want. My kid was kiIIed. Burned to death. Just a bIack Iump this size. They cremate them anyway. There was no smoke from the chimney at the crematorium. Most of my kid was burned aIready. A woman did it. She was junior to me at work, had a university degree, unIike me. Pretty good-Iooking. We?d have a few drinks,... have sex. I made her have an abortion twice. Is that reason enough to kiII? Hey. Hey, is that enough to kiII? I don?t know. I?m sorry. HeIIo? You here to see someone? Yes. Her room is around the corner. You knew each other? No, we just happened to go home together that day. And I heard that she was here. Oh? - You must be gIad. - Why? - You heard the doctor. - What? Oh. Your husband? Is he coming to pick you up? No, I don?t think so. We?re getting divorced. ReaIIy? Go ahead and gossip. She?s here. HeIIo! We happened to be in the area. - Oh. - Someone was here to see you. A man. We?II probabIy ask you to come in again tomorrow, so be ready. - Take care of yourseIf. Let?s go. - OK. See you. Hey!
