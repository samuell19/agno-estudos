CHANTEL: You know, tomorrow y'all might be reading about this in the papers. Or y'all might even see it on TV. Y'all might shake your heads and say somebody was real bugged out, or they was on crack or something. Some people hear about my neighborhood and assume some real fucked-up things.

Yo, them trains from Brooklyn is a motherfucker. Carlos called in sick. I've been waiting for you to get here. Keep an eye on things till I'm back. Yo, you know I got it covered. You know that. You can trust me. Just keep things under control while I'm gone. I'll be back soon. ( girls giggling ) Oh, girl. There isn't any Brie or caraway seeds. Yeah, I'm sorry, miss. We're all out. I really need it. They told me that you're in charge? Yeah, I place an order in today, and it won't be here until Tuesday. That's not good enough. I'm expecting people tonight. So, what I want you to do is I want you to pick up the phone, dial another store and tell them to bring it here in the next hour. I'll send someone to pick it up. What I want you-- Sorry, miss, it's impossible. The shipment won't be here until Tuesday. These people-- Hm. Is this $2.47 or $2.49? Is that a seven? Yo, Anna, price check on virgin olive oil, one liter. ANNA: Got it! Do you know why they call this stuff virgin? Well, when I was in Italy... they had this special process where they-- You know what? I don't why I'm asking in the first place. You don't know nothing about being no virgin, do you? ( both laugh ) You told her. I need to speak to your manager. Check this out. You know your old man? He comes in every once in a while. He's screwing someone half your age. Tsk, tsk, tsk. That's it. I will find him myself. Have a good search. She better have this stuff delivered. Homegirl. Yo, you see how much she paid for that shit? Word. Yo, my parents don't make that much in a week, and they got three of us to feed. Yo, Natete, I'm gonna be making crazy bank like that one day. Definitely. Yo. Word up. Come on. Let's get out of here. All right, girl. Just think, this time next Saturday night, we'll be surrounded by some men, y'all. Some real men. Ha, ha, ha! NATETE: Tell me what he said. CHANTEL: He didn't wanna hear my side of the story. He's a punk. Bastard, that's what he is. Yo, that customer was rude, point blank. And she was old and ugly. Yeah, you know, he was making me stack boxes. Does he think we're stupid? He gotta get real. Yo, the next time he tells us to stack those boxes, I'm gonna tell him where he can put them. Truly. And plus my back is killing me. Word. Yo, I'm gonna be having my period soon, and Lavonica's having her party. That's not gonna be no mood. That is not right. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's the jacket I was telling you about. No! For real? That's the jacket? I've been saving up for weeks for this jacket. That thing is over! I'm gonna look good this weekend. That thing is definitely working. Yo, people today be bugging. The other day I was on the number two train with my friend, just bugging out, having a good time, and people just started staring at us like we was some sort of street girls with no future. Yo, when I'm with my friends, I act like it don't matter, because it don't. But between you and me, that shit pisses me off. When they think they can just judge you by the way you dress? Uh-uh. I always get A's and B's in all my classes. I'm the best student in my calc class. People be tripping when they find out how smart I really am. ( girls laugh ) Look at your face, girl. What's up? Girl, I was about to slap the shit out of you. It's good to see you all. What's up? Oh, let me see the baby. Yo, this Imani. Get out of here. You made that name up. That is fly. Yo, no. That means "faith" in Yoruba. What? Whatever. You'd think he'd look like Derek anyway. Too bad, right, because I ain't seen his sorry ass since I had the baby. Don't even say that. You was the cutest couple in school. Well, check this out. He gives me some dollars, but he don't wanna put in no time. It's a lot of fucking work taking care of a baby. Men! Where you living? Last week I tried calling you at your crib and some woman answered saying you ain't living there. What's up with that? That was my father's girlfriend. I can't stand her ass! Get out of here. I had a big fight with her. I'm in the projects living with my mother. If it wasn't for my moms, I don't know what I would do. NATETE: Yo, how long was you in labor? Oh, honey! My labor almost killed me. The doctor gave me shots and enema the whole time. I thought I was gonna break in two. I threw up the whole night. It was awful. Ene-- Enem-- Enema. Enema. That's when the doctor shoves something up your ass to make you-- Oh! They don't do that when you have a baby, do they? Yes, they do, girl. MAN: Stand clear of the closing doors. Yo, you ignorant fool! My friend's got a baby back here! You almost crushed the baby to death, you fucking idiot! You stupid idiot! Yo, Denisha! Denisha, Lavonica's having a party. You gonna come? I can't leave the baby with my moms. She'll have a fit. You cannot miss this jam. It's gonna be the joint. Oh, come on! Let your moms take care of Imani. Shoot. All right, she'll do it. I'll be there. I'll be there. MAN: Let the doors go, please. All right. Be there. Peace, baby. Yo, man, Denisha looked real worn out. You think she gonna come back to school? Mm-mm. Dead issue. What? She ain't coming back. How you know that? Yo, that's her problem. I have plenty enough problems of my own. Yo, trying to figure out how to get them new sneakers. Yo, them high tops are bad. And that jacket. Yo. That's the only thing you're concerned about? You buggin'. Man.

You know the promotion I've been telling you about? Yeah. They gave it to somebody else. You knew that was gonna happen. They gave the job to the bitch I trained. Well, it's the same old story. They don't wanna hire us black folks, even if we're qualified. So forget about it! I can't forget about it. Owen, if I would've gotten the job, I could have been getting another $1.50 an hour. We could've used the money. I don't wanna talk about it. I gotta go to work in a half hour. You know, I work hard on my job. I work just as hard as you do. Then I come home from work, I cook, I clean, do the laundry, keep those boys from killing themselves. If it weren't for Chantel, I don't know what I'd do.

Andre. Hitler killed six million Jews. That's right. The United States had a moral obligation to this war. We saved many lives. Chantel? But don't we have a moral obligation to the people of today? Yes, but this is a history class. We're not dealing with contemporary issues. I mean, African-American males die every day from drugs, violence and AIDS. African-American babies die twice as much as white babies right here in this country. What's our obligation to that? Now is not the right time to discuss that. But when is the right time to discuss something that means something to us? I told you, we'll discuss this at another time. Mr. Weinberg, this is important to me and to a lot of the other students in this classroom. I mean, these are our people. And it should be important to you too. Aren't we all in this together? Chantel, I told you, this is a history class. Isn't it important to talk about things going on today? The things that we could do something about? Yes. Can we get back to history now? Thank you. Now, back to the Holocaust. Where were we? ( school bell rings ) Chantel. What? Don't you ever do that again. ( scoffs ) Do what? Interrupt my history class. I told you we would discuss it later. If I have an opinion, I have the right to express it. This is my history class. I will run it according to my lesson plan. I'd expect you to have a little more consideration for your classmates. The others feel the same fucking way. Chantel, don't you ever curse at me. One more smart remark, you'll go to principal's office. Shit. "Shit"? Why don't you go right now? Tell Mr. Moore I sent you. Chantel, you're one of my best students. Why are you always making Mr. Weinberg so angry? Yo, that guy should be teaching gym, shop or something-- That's enough. That's enough. But all I'm doing is expressing my opinion. Apparently you're expressing your opinion at the wrong time. Look, you can't go around preaching about the plight of black people in every history class. Mr. Moore, that is not fair. If your cursing and your disruptions continue, I'll have to suspend you. Mr. Moore, you can't screw me up now. I wanna graduate after my junior year. The rules are the rules. If I allow you to talk back to my teachers, the other students are gonna wanna do the same. I can't have that. Mr. Moore, I wanna become a doctor. Now, if I get good grades and enough credits, what's the problem? I mean, now, it will be a waste of time for me to stick around here another year. Chantel, listen to me. If you wanna go to college, you're gonna have to behave more like a lady. Okay? You've gotta tone that mouth of yours down. Your behavior now is unsuitable for college. What the fuck do you mean? Don't curse at me, young lady! You trying to say I'm not good enough to go to college? That's exactly what I'm talking about. You've gotta tone that mouth of yours down. All your teachers are saying the same thing. You don't understand me, Mr. Moore. I wanna become a doctor. No one wants a doctor with an attitude like yours. You've gotta become more of a lady. What the fuck does being a young lady have to do with being a doctor? I wanna help people. With an attitude like that, you can't even help yourself. Besides, going to college takes time. Yo, it's the beginning of the semester. I can apply for the scholarships with those other seniors. ( sighs ) You're not ready. Stay another year. Look, it's like this. Going to college is a big, big step... Shit. I get the best grades in all my classes, even physics. What the fuck does my attitude gotta do with it? Why I gotta wait? Yo, I wanna go to college. I wanna go to college now! Yo, he just thinks he's better than everybody else anyway. Yo, I gotta just get out of the projects. That's all I'm saying. Yo, I just gotta see something different. Don't rush into college. Man, listen, I ain't having it. Develop the skills that will make you a young lady. So be patient, Chantel, and don't rush things.

What's so hard about that? Most guys don't like them. I don't even like the way it feels. No, I don't know, with AIDS going around. Oh, boy. Listen, I read that this woman, she met this guy in a club, you know, and then found out he had AIDS and died, now she's gonna die. Yeah, but none of our friends use rubbers, and nobody likes the way it feels. Yo, don't you care if you die? Look, I'm gonna die sooner or later, and before I die, I wanna know what it's like to feel a real man up inside of me. Not some piece of plastic shit. Besides, the only way you can get it is if you gay or an intravenous drug user, so chill, because I ain't fucking with nobody like that! You don't know where he's been. That's right. You don't know. Lavonica, you need to chill. That's a bunch of crap you talking about. Yo, that's intelligence. No, it's not no kind of intelligence. You watching too much 20/20, and you reading too much Enquirer. You can't be afraid of everything. But you know what I found out? BOTH: What? If you fucking while you got your period, you won't get pregnant. Girlfriend! Damn, Natete. Shit, I'm eating. Why don't you just have him pull out when he comes? Uh-uh. Wait, wait. Better yet. If you do it while you're standing up, you won't get pregnant. It works. It works! It works!

CHANTEL: Natete, I told you not to make so much damn noise. Yo, I told you to yell up. My pops is sleeping. NATETE: I did yell up. He was working all night long. Out, y'all. I'm telling Mommy. You didn't have to hit me. Get up. Get out of my business. You see I've got company. Yo, I had a good time at that party last night. Yeah. I cannot believe that we was, like, rocking until 6 a.m., girl. I know. You know, but I'm hungry. What you got to eat? Come on, Natete, get out of my refrigerator. Stop feeding your face.

Yo, tell me about leaving with that guy last night. He was gorgeous! Oh, word. I know he was, but listen. He tried to play all fly and that at school.

You know he was mad for you leaving last night. Like I care, but listen. Ty has got some real bank. Yeah, right. Yo, his Jeep is fly. What? He's got a Jeep! You gotta see it. But listen. Thanks for covering last night. Yo, my moms doesn't suspect a thing. If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have gotten over. I know you gonna be looking out for me one day. One day? Get a man first. Oh, give me a break, girl. You're holding face. See? Dang. What? I don't understand how you be getting so good grades on those calc tests. Well, that's because I'm smarter than you. What? No, I'm only playing. Yo, if you need the help, I'm here. All you have to do is ask. Well, when you become a doctor, you remember who helped get you your first good lay. Me. Thank you. That's right. Come on, let's go, babe. What? Oh, man! Why you all dressed up? I'm not dressed up. What you trying to say? Don't I always look nice? No, no, you just look crazy fresh. You wanna stop on the way at the McDonald's, or what? Gerard, I can't walk home with you today. I'm waiting for Natete. We're gonna hang. So I'll hang out with y'all. No, you don't understand. See, she's having problems with this little fella and everything so, you know, she needs me. A sister-to-sister time. Natete? Natete? Man, she need all the help she can get!

I even doubled up. Come on. Lots of girls get pregnant in high school. I'm not like everybody else in high school. What time is it? Okay. Ready? Oh, shit, Natete! It's pink just like the last test! Damn. This is it. Well, are you gonna tell Ty? Oh, no, wait. Or do you have to tell Gerard? This is definitely Ty's. Well... At least the baby's gonna be cute. And Ty got bank. I'm not thinking about that, Natete. Well, you're not pregnant, okay? Maybe. Okay. You know... sometimes these tests are wrong. So I think to be on the safe side, maybe I should go to a clinic, because this can't be it. That just can't be it. Hold up. Wait a minute. Look. See? Okay, good. It says for accurate testing that you should go see a-- Oh, God. Oh, come on, now. It says for accurate-- For accurate testing that you should go see a physician. It's gonna be okay. I don't know.

Chantel, just lay back on the table. That's it. Stretch out. Now put your feet in the stirrups. That's a girl. I see you missed two or three of your menstrual cycles. Um, I'm not sure, but I think it was only two. Oh, that's all right. We'll find out what's going on. Yeah, I know the meetings are part of my job. Okay, I'll be there. Now... I can't go through nine months carrying my baby, going through a labor and then giving it up for adoption. Nah. I can't do that. What about abortion? Look, we're a federally-funded clinic. I can't give out that information. I wanna find out about abortion. It's my decision, not the fucking government's! I think you should have that right too, but I'm breaking the rules just talking about it. I'm 17. I wanna go to college. And I wanna become a doctor. I fucked up. You had sex and got pregnant, that's all. You used protection, but you didn't use the pill properly. Anyway, no birth-control method can guarantee you won't get pregnant. What about the father? I told you, I do not wanna talk about my parents. I mean your boyfriend. Have you told him yet? No. He should share the responsibility. Yeah, right. He's gonna be shocked like you were. Then he'll just have to deal with it. Oh... Do you have a good relationship with him? Please! If you're not gonna tell your parents, I'd feel better if you told someone. You shouldn't have to make a decision like this by yourself. You could bring him here. I can help you tell him if it's easier. I ain't afraid of him. I'll tell him. You two can read these brochures together. Um, how much longer do I have? The sooner you make the decision, the better. Remember, it's illegal to have an abortion after the third trimester. What's that? Your 25th week. So I have plenty of time then. No, you don't. Now, I don't mean to rush you, but it's important that you make a decision soon. Now, here's my business card. And call me if you have any questions. I'll even give you my home phone number. And Chantel, I'm required by law to advise you to seek prenatal care and public assistance. Okay? ( baby crying ) Is this the line where you apply for public assistance? If you mean welfare, yeah. You at the right place. Chiniqua! Chiniqua, bring your little butt over here. You got a light? You got a light? No. You got a light? There ain't no smoking in here. What you mean, there's no smoking in here? They have us here all damn week. We keep coming back and forth from person to person. They're gonna tell you you can't fucking smoke in here. You got any kids? Well, don't have any, because they're a pain in the ass. Chiniqua! Chiniqua, bring your little ass over here! Will you come over here? Excuse me. Could you watch my chair? I'm going outside to have a cigarette. Come on, girl. On the application you filled out, it said you lived with your parents. Yeah. Both of whom are working. Well, your household income is too much. You can't get welfare. Next. RASHAWN: Hey! You better leave me alone. I'm serious. I'm gonna tell Mom. What're you doing out? Did you do your homework? Look, look, look. Come on, now. What do you think--? This isn't funny! Yes it is! Look, look-- This all I need! Why you always in my business? Rashawn, stop embarrassing me! Give me back my pads! Ooh, I'm gonna tell Mommy! What're you gonna tell her? Trust me, she knows, she knows. No, she doesn't! I'm-- Look, if you're not home, I'm gonna tell her. Yeah, right! I know you didn't do your homework. Man, leave me alone. You leave me alone! Ah, leave me alone. ( grunts ) Days and weeks went by, and I did nothing. I went about business as usual. Fuck. Maybe I'm not pregnant. Maybe it's just a dream, and it'll go away. So tell me what happened. I didn't go. What do you mean, you didn't go? I didn't go. I'm not pregnant. How do you know you're not pregnant if you didn't go to the clinic? I just know, all right? I got my period. Oh, honey, I'm glad to hear that! You didn't think I was stupid enough to get pregnant.

( dance music playing ) You know, I went right ahead with my plans for college. I didn't even think about being pregnant. Shit. I have more important things to think about than that. Now, this map you see is the map we see in our textbooks. We've been taught that this map is geographically correct. Well, uh-uh, it's not. Our education is miseducation. Now, you see this map over here on my left? This map is a geographically-correct map. Now, as you can see, continents like Africa and other nations of people of color are much larger than they appear in our textbooks. Chantel, where did you get your information? I mean, your information can't possibly be correct. I wrote to a Dr. Margaret Scott. She has a PhD in geographical research. Now, I wrote to her, and she wrote me back, so she's willing to come to the class if you want her to. ( laughter ) Continue, Chantel. Thank you. Now, making Africa and other nations of people of color smaller than they appear diminishes their importance. Now, we've been getting history through a Eurocentric perspective. In order for us to live together, we have to have a fair and accurate account of our history. ( students cheering ) Chantel, I been looking all over for you! Yo, don't talk to me! You dissed me! Look, I've been through this before. I talked to my uncle. You told him I was pregnant? Yo, he's cool. Shit! I know about all his babes, and my aunt would kill him if she found out. Listen. He's gonna give me $500. We can go to Jersey on Saturday. Jersey. We can stay over. We can take care of everything then. We'll come back Sunday. I got it all figured out. See, my uncle said one of his babes got it done. It didn't take that long. Just a couple of hours, that's all. Nobody'll ever know. What the fuck are you talking about? I have the money. I'll pay for it. We did not talk about this! We don't need to talk. Just do it! I don't know what I wanna do! WOMAN: Shh! Quiet. Chantel, baby. Women have abortions all the time. Don't make such a big deal out of this. Nah. Nah, Ty, don't let you and your twobit fucking uncle tell me what to do. This is my decision. Ty, I'm the one that has to go through this abortion, not you. Yo, you bugging! You can't take care of no baby! I'm not sure what I can do, but you ain't helping any. Yo, yo, yo. Wait a second.

Yo, where'd you get the bank from? Ty gave it to me. Oh, my God! Girl, look at that bank. Oh, my God! Girl, they haute coutured you up. Let me tell you. It never looked like this. For real. You know me and my curls. How do you like my nails, though? You didn't tell me you was getting that color. Don't they look nice? Look at the color they gave me. Let's spend some real money. That's what I want. Aw, Natete. Yo, we can get Denisha a pin. Oh, those. They're cute. Look at the Nefertitis. Ah, man, that is so neat. Yo, that's for that! Friends forever. Remember that. So cute! Hold up. Wait a minute. How about this? Girl, I'm not going on no Star Search audition no time. Here's your receipt, miss. Thank you very much and have a nice day. Damn! We spent $500 already?

You'll have to talk to him sooner or later. Take this hat-- Give me a break! Uh-uh. Trollop. I am not talking to h-- Put my earrings back. Oh, man. Until I get my rings, girl, then you get my earrings. You know, just give Ty back his money, then. Oh, Miss Natete. Woman of the world. Did we forget? You are wearing some of his $500 too. I know. But now, why Ty give you the money anyway? Oh, he said something about some old Jeep he wanted to do something with, but you know-- You like this? I don't like that at all. Well, I spent that shit! I know you did. What you think if I wrap it up? Wrap it up? Like that? Uh-uh. So, what you gonna do now about Ty? Well, I'm just gonna lay low for a while. ( phone rings ) Yo, I'm waiting till this blows over. I ain't crazy! Girl! I sure do have my moms fooled. I even bought identical pairs of pants and skirts. One size was the size I used to be that I couldn't fit into anymore. And the other size was the size I really was. So if my moms ever did the laundry or came into my room, I always had the other set in my closet or in the laundry. See, when you're pregnant, your body goes through all these changes, and you feel them. Shit, I had to do something, though, to hide that I was getting bigger. But I couldn't do this much longer. It was getting real expensive. Yo, Chantel. You been hiding from me long enough. You better get out of here, Ty. You're not supposed to be in here. Fuck this. Wait a minute. You touch me, I'm gonna scream. Look. Even though what you did was low, I'm not gonna hit you. I wouldn't do that. Chantel, you're about to have a baby. I just wanna talk sense into your dumb ass! I don't have to listen to you! Oh, you're gonna listen. Just what the fuck is going on? I gave you the money for the abortion! I thought that's what we decided. We decided? What you decided, not me! You took the money! You made me take it. I didn't know what I wanted to do! What you gonna do now? I don't know. You gonna have the baby or what? I don't know! You still thinking about having an abortion? I think it's too late. Damn! Look. Look! You gonna have to decide something. ( door closes ) What you doing in here? Get out of here! Damn, Chantel! Why don't you try using a bedroom next time? This is a public place! She must be crazy. Chantel think she can do stuff anywhere. ( groaning ) I'm not stupid. I know my moms would notice that I was getting bigger, but check this out. In the middle of the night, I'd throw away a half-eaten cake or the rest of the chicken from dinner. And then when she would notice that I was gaining weight she would just think that I was a pig, not that I was pregnant.

Come on, come on, come on. Oh, Ty! What? Oh, it hurts so badly! Go-- Go in my backpack! Where? Hold it. Let me find it. There's a book about pregnancy. Hurry up. Quick! All right. All right, all right, all right. Shit. Oh, shit. Where is it? Where is it? Ty, hurry up! Okay, okay, okay. ( groaning ) What is it? What is it? Where's it at? Hurry up! I ain't found nothing yet! Okay, okay, okay. I got it. The first stages of labor is when you feel contractions. Then your water breaks. Okay, so it looks like you're in labor. So-- "Next you'll feel a sharp pain. "These pains are contractions. "They will come closer and closer. Labor can last-- Labor can last two to 24 hours." Damn! "Sometimes labor has to be induced." Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, the pain is getting worse! Damn it! Ty. What? ( screaming ) You try and read it! Oh, damn it, Ty! You read it! Hey, yo, yo, I'll call-- I'm in a lot of pain here. No, no, no. I'm calling 911. Tell me what to do! We'll get you to the hospital! No. I'm not going. Fuck this! Damn! CHANTEL: Hurry! Hurry! Oh, shit. Hurry up! ( screaming ): Ty! Ty! Oh, no! Come here. Come here, baby. Come here. Oh, no! Come here. Here. Come on. Drink some water. Drink some water. Drink some water. Come on. Drink some water. Drink some water. I just want ice. All right, here it is. Put that blanket on you. Oh, it's so hot in here! Oh, someone please open the window. Oh, shit. ( screaming ) It's all right. It's all right. It's okay. Oh, Ty! Yo, yo, yo. I'm taking you to the hospital. No! Yo, yo! Hold on! I'm taking you to the hospital. No! I'm taking you to the hospital. You gotta go to the hospital. You gotta go to the hospital. Come on. No. I don't care what you say. No! No! I gotta get you some help! No! Shit! Just let me find my keys. All right? Chantel, it's gonna be okay. ( moaning ) No. No. No. Oh, God. ( telephone rings ) Let the machine get it. Don't worry about it. PAULA: Let me see who it is. Come on, sweetie. Paula, it's Chantel. Chantel Mitchell. Chantel, it's Paula. Chantel, are you all right? No! Oh, please, Paula, help me. My water broke! Oh, Paula, I'm so scared! Sweetie, how far apart are your contractions? It's about every five minutes. Ow! There's going to be a lot of pain, but that's natural. Just relax. Okay, listen to me. Are you alone? No, I'm-- I'm at my boyfriend's house. Ty. Okay, relax, relax. Let me speak to him. Who's that? It's the lady from the clinic. Why she wanna talk to me? I had to call somebody. Take the phone! Yo, okay. Tyrone, I'm Paula. I met Chantel at the clinic. Now I want you to listen to me very carefully. From the sounds of Chantel's breathing, she's about to have the baby. Call 911-- No, we ain't calling the police or nobody. Ty, you don't seem to understand. She is in premature labor now-- No, goddamn it! We ain't doing it like that! Look, we don't have time to argue. Now I'm going to give you some instructions. Get a pitcher of ice water. Put it by her bed. Keep her drinking water and going to the bathroom as much as possible. There's going to be a lot of blood and fluid. Get towels. Shit! Take the blankets off the bed. Hurry up! Okay, okay, okay. Yo, I think I got it. Yo, Paula. I don't know if I can do this. Ty, the baby's gonna come whether we want it to or not. Now, you gotta listen to me. Breath deep. Ty, let me speak to her. All right. Here's Chantel. Sweetie? You gotta stop screaming. I know it's hard, but you gotta save your energy. Don't tighten up, stay loose. Don't scream, but grunt. I'll try, Paula. I'll try, Paula. What's Ty's address? Two-twenty. Two-twenty. Brooklyn Avenue. Brooklyn Avenue. Now, look. I'm gonna call the EMS. No, Paula! No, you promised you wasn't gonna tell anybody! Calm down. I won't tell anybody. Stay calm. I want you to worry about having the baby, that's all. ( Chantel moaning ) WOMAN: 911. Yes. I'd like an ambulance sent to 220 Brooklyn Avenue. It's an emergency. We don't have anything. You don't have an ambulance available in that area? Forty-five minutes to an hour. It'll take you 45 minutes to an hour? Please hold. Hello? Hello? Shit! They don't wanna come to our neighborhood. Look, you're not going there by yourself. I'm coming with you. Ty! Where'd you go? I had to get the stuff Paula told me to get. Look, Ty! There's blood all over the sheets! Shit! Fuck, Chantel, can't you wait? I gotta get my Jeep. I'm gonna take you to the hospital! No, I can't wait! The baby's coming now! Goddamn! Oh, shit. Damn! Ty, you have to help me. Aah! The baby's coming out! Oh, shit! can't you wait? Shit. Oh, shit. Okay. Okay, breathe. Breathe. Breathe slowly. Come on, baby. Breathe slowly. Come on, Chantel. Push. Push. Push. Come on, baby. Push, push. ( screaming ) I see the baby's head. Come on. Come on. Come on. Take your time. Take your time. Breathe. Take it out! Take it out! All right, come on. It's almost out, Chantel. It's all right. One more last push. Come on. Come on, baby. Push. Come on. Push! It's almost out, Chantel. ( baby crying ) Oh, shit! It looks like a little girl. It is! Ty, shit! Oh, shit! ( screams ) Oh, shit. Come on. Come on, now. God-- What is that? Oh, shit! Holy shit! Oh, shit. There's another one coming! Oh, shit! What the fuck is that? Oh, shit! Chantel, what is that? Oh, it's the baby's afterbirth. Oh, shit! Just take it away! I don't wanna see it! Oh, shit. Come on, Chantel. But you can at least look at it! Just take it away. Take it away where someone never finds it. Just take it away, please. You can at least look at it. Look, just take it out of here. Nobody knows. You can't abandon a baby like that! We gotta do something. No, no, no. You can't-- Nobody knows I had this baby except you and Paula! You cannot abandon a baby like that. Somebody might see me go out with the baby! Damn it! Just take it out in this! No, Chan-- Listen to me! Somebody might see me, and we could get arrested! I don't wanna get stuck with this baby! I wanna do things. I wanna have a nice life. I don't wanna be ending like-- I don't wanna end up like my parents. Oh, no. No fucking way! You sure you wanna go through with this? Yes! Okay, okay, okay. All right. I'll take it out there. I'll take it out. I got everything under control. Okay, I'm leaving. I'll take care of everything. I'll take care of everything. It'll be okay. I'll leave. I'll take care of everything. Don't worry. I'll handle it. I'll be back.

MAN: We should get her to the hospital. She don't look so good. CHANTEL: I love him. PAULA: I can't do that until I find out what happened to the baby. Doctors will ask questions. They'll bring in the police. Honey, did you deliver a bloody mass after the birth? Yes. Well, where is it? I have to look at it. With the baby. Did Tyrone take the baby to the hospital? No, I told him to throw the baby out. You did what? ( baby crying faintly ) CHANTEL: Paula, don't be mad at me. I was scared. I just told him to take it out with the garbage bags so nobody would know what it was. Paula, I just want my baby back. Help me find her. PAULA: All right, all right. We'll get the baby back.

But I really don't have no time to be hanging out. Fuck! I mean, I just been too busy. The baby's been sick. Ty's even sold his Jeep to help with Kiana's doctor bills.
