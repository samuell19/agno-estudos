Well, we can have a date night. - That would be so nice. - Who's here? - Aunt Daphne! - Who's here? Hi, baby girl. Someone has been counting the seconds until you showed up. It is so good to see you. I'm so excited to do some crafts with you. I made some very good plans for us. You made some good plans for us? Yeah. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Adrian ♪ It was at some Chinese supermarket. - Oh, my God. - Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. - Good to see you. - Thanks. Right on time, 30 minutes late. I almost did not come today. Oh, no. I just want you both to know that. - Uh, I broke up with Adrian. - Well, that's... And I quit my job. And I'm living in Billie's pool house again. And everything's great. Oh... All in the last seven days? Hey, more than anything, I just feel, like, this extreme amount of self-hate. I mean, he loved me so much, and he took such good care of me, and he... Like, I really thought that he was gonna be the one. - Yeah. - You know? Investing four years into something? Like, I'll just be like my mom forever, just... - That's not true. - searching for a yes and not finding it, but... Maybe it's time to take a break, you know? - I mean, I know that's... - Take a break from what? Dating? a radical idea, but yeah. Yeah, a break from all of it. A break from dating. A break from... running and chasing and, like, reaching out for some outside thing and just take time alone. That thought's terrifying. That's probably a good thing. And, you know, if you need work, why don't you just take a couple of shifts here? - I could totally use the help. - Really? Oh, yes. There's a million things you could do here. Are you kidding? It'd be great. So six months? - Six solo months. - All right. It'll just be me and my vibrator. And I'm just gonna throw alcohol in there, - because why not? So... - Wow. Wow, that would be very impressive - if you could pull off... - Have a little faith in me. - I have faith in you. - I can do it. I know you can do it. I mean, I was just... Look, I have to do it for the next seven months, too, so it's nice to have a partner in crime, right? We're gonna go into warrior now. So, um... Yeah, so fill me in. Like, let me know what you've been up to and... Yeah, I mean, similarly to what we spoke about on the phone, I was in... from Los Angeles originally, moved to New York. That's where I really got my feet off the ground. I've never actually worked in a gallery before, but I have a lot of experience dealing with galleries and understanding how they function and, you know, what people want from the outside, what people are desiring from the inside. And it's exciting to me, specifically curation. Okay, so you were in programming at LACMA for four years. - Yes. - And then... the Los Angeles Center for Progress in the Arts for... for six months? That's... Yeah, it just wasn't the culture for me. Hmm. Okay. COBRA coverage. This is Beth speaking. How can I help you? Hi there. Uh, I just need to check and see how long my coverage is gonna last. Can I get the contact of your previous supervisor? Um, Jed Hill. Do we have permission to call him on your behalf? Hello? Yeah, of course. I don't know why you're doing this. I don't really know why I am, either. Hi. My name is Daphne Mirador. It's so lovely to speak with you. Thank you so much for taking the time. Um, I worked for Los Angeles Center for Progress in the Arts. I have a lot of experience in the nonprofit art world, uh, bringing art and creative expression, whether that be fine art... In five years, I would love to be working... I mean, I would love to be working with you guys. And that's really something that I'm passionate about, because so many artists, as you know, are out there struggling and just trying to get by and trying to make it, and there's oftentimes... Yeah, of course. No worries at all. I'll check back in... in a few months and see where you guys are at. Yeah, n-no problem. Um... w-would it be good, perhaps, if I checked back in in a couple of weeks? Okay. Uh, s-sorry. Um, do you happen to know anyone else who may be hiring right now? Well, what do you want to be? I'm whatever I want to be. Trying to get ready for the danger with this. There you go. Yep, that's your magic wand. When I do this, your thingie moves like this. Fuck. Hey, can I get some quarters, please? Oh, there you are. Merry Christmas. Same to you. Come on in. - Ohh. - Have you heard from Billie? Uh, she hasn't told me when they're coming. Uh, yeah. No, Abby has the flu, so I don't think they're gonna make it... - Oh, no. - unfortunately. Yeah. - Oh, I'm... I'm so... - Looks nice in here. Yeah. Uh, you know, Carl has really let me sort of... How do I put it? My own personal touch on this place, so it feels much more like home. I haven't been for a while. I guess so, like everywhere and there. Mm-hmm. You know, who I did that for. Um... sometimes not... - what year and stuff, but... - Yeah, yeah. - Of course. - Yeah. It's been, like, uh... a month out of the year, I'm flying. No, I'm okay, actually. - I'm not drinking right now. - Why not? Just need to take a break. Oh, honey, this is not the time to stop drinking, on Christmas. Here. Is Adrian gonna meet us here or... Um, Adrian and I broke up. When did this happen? Um, few weeks ago. Wow. I did not know that. I can't say that I'm surprised. What do you mean? Well, I... You know, look, Adrian was a... was a very lovely guy, but he clearly wasn't the one, right? Time will tell. There was no... There was no fire. There was no... There wasn't that passion. Well, we had... I mean, we had a great relationship. You know, he's... he's a wonderful person. So where are... where are you living now? At Billie's. Ah, right. Well, my daughters are very secretive. - I had no idea. - Not intentionally. You can call us anytime. You know that. I'm really glad. I'm glad you're... you're with Billie and you get to be with your niece. I'm sure she's thrilled about that. Oh. All right, I gotta give this to you. I can't... I came across this, and I thought, "This belongs to Daphne." Merry Christmas. Thank you. Wow, is this the... Is that your wedding ring from my father? I have a life with Carl now, and, you know, I came across that, and I-I thought... I thought it would make you happy. Yeah, it's won... it's beautiful. Happy birthday, baby. Thank you, guys. Thank you for being here. - Don't even give me that. - I'm doing shots with them... I know. And look how you're... You're treating me like a 12-year-old child. Is this why you quit your job? Is this why, out of nowhere, you decide to up and leave your job last week? - Why are you acting like this? - We wake up every day, and we do the same thing. It's like we've been married for fucking 30... Honey, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I feel bad about not going, but I... It's just so stre... I'm just trying to stay super Zen - about everything right now... - Yeah, yeah. and she really triggers me, so... You don't need that in your life. The baby, and I know that it's important. And then it's so confusing, 'cause then she's... really wonderful, but then I almost don't believe the sincerity of how wonderful she is. You know what? It actually wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, compared to other years. Sent you into the lion's den alone. Are these going inside or outside? These are gonna go outside. - All right... - These ones are? let's start with these. Yeah. Have you guys ever seen "Best in Show"? Like, the dog has never won, like, toy, and they flip out. Hey, do you, uh, got another one? Oh. Thank you. Happy new year. Happy new year. You ready? - You ready for the new year? - I actually am. I'm very ready for the new year. - Really? - Ready for this one to be done. That's good. How do you know these people? Billie's my sister. Billie's your sister. That's nice. - How do you know her? - She seems like a nice person. I don't know her. Uh, no. I'm here because a friend brought me. Uh, you know, and I didn't have any New Year's plans. I was gonna sit at home and watch "The Pianist," but instead I decided that, "You know what? People sounds like a good idea for New Year's Eve," so I'm here. Yeah. Where's your drink? Taking a little break. Probably why I'm in a corner by myself. Yeah. I'll... I'll drink for you. How's that? Who are you hiding from in that dress? All right, that's that. I just started to feel pain listening to myself talk to you. No, that's because you're in my suffer zone. - Is that what it is? - That's what it is. Oh, dear God. I never had a suffer zone. I mean, I suffer everywhere, but... I would like to keep it to a zone, if I could. Yeah, you should probably leave now. - Oh, okay. - Before I destroy you - with my radioactive sadness. - But you already did. 'Cause now I know you're here, so I have to deal with that fact, but I guess I'll just try and deal with it here. This is good, right? You're gonna have to move another step. I'm sorry. It's still too close. Still too close. Good of you to come. All right, I'm gonna go die. - See you later. - Cheers. Hi. Mm. - Daphne? - Hi. - Daphne? Yeah. - Yeah. Hi. - Jack. - Yeah, how are you? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm good. - How are you? - I'm good. You're a... You're a writer. - I'm a writer, yes. - You're a writer. - I'm a writer. That's good. - I know. Okay. Hi. And you're an artist? Well, I'm not an artist. I work... I work in the art world. Okay. Were you writing a book? I was writing a book. Did you read my book? - Yeah. - Okay. - What was it called? - Yeah. "Great Book." - "The Great Book" by Jack... - "The Great Book." - Yeah, "Great Book." - Jack... Maybe, um, it was by Nathanael West. Hmm? Yes. Yeah, I didn't... - I didn't read your book. - Okay. But I remember hearing about it. I was about to ask you why you're here, and then I remembered you're Billie's sister. I'm sorry. That's so stupid. No, it's... I'm really here because, like, I live in the pool house... - Oh, wow. Wow. - currently. I should not have told you that. That's a really embarrassing fact. - Now I know where you live. - Why did I do that? Well, that's dangerous. We don't know each other very well. I just admitted to you that I'm living in my sister's pool house. That's fine. What's wrong with that? I don't know. What's wrong with that? - What's wrong with that? - Everything is wrong with that. Unloading on you. That's... That's cool. That's fine. Was it, um... I don't know. Was it unexpected? - The breakup? - Yeah. I would give anything to understand why I do things sometimes. - He was one of the "good ones." - Okay. So that makes me, I guess, the shitty one... - No, no, no, no. - in the situation. I think everyone feels like that. I think, like, everyone is juggling with this idea of a bad person, themselves a good person, "Some things I did right, things I did wrong," and then they're casting variations of that on the people that they loved, and they have totally different ideas of what they think they did right and what they think they did wrong. So... - You're such a writer. - where... That's not... Yeah, yeah, okay. - That... - 9, 8... - Here we go. - 7, 6, 5, 4, 3... 2, 1... happy new year! - Happy new year. - Another? Another. Another revamp on my life. Okay. Happy new year. Happy new year. Want some Thai food? Thai food? That's great. - Thai food's great. - Isn't it? It's more like ramen. I'm a good dancer. What is it, skill? Oh, yeah. It's definitely... Oh, that's good. ...for the reception. Is it? What is it like? All right, you're gonna look, like, right in here. Go get me an extra plate. - Another, please. - Oh, did I grab them all? Sorry about that. I'm like, "There's finally none." What are you looking for? - Huh? - Happy new year. - Hi. - Hey. - Aunt Daphne! - Hi, sweetie. Do you think Ingrid will notice if I end up just stealing half the clothing items that are in here? I won't tell. Have you always worked here? Does that work, like, in your relationship... - I mean... - to be together all the time? I'm not getting paid. So is that work, or is that donation-based? I think that's called love. - Yeah, I just help out a little. - Or leashed. It's one of them. Love or a leash? Nothing like that. I'm actually planning a trip to Ireland. I was wondering if you had anything green that I could wear to make me fit in. Hi. Hi. - Yeah. - Just... Just casually shopping on a... on a weekday afternoon? - Yeah, I am. I can do that. - Do you not have a job? - I can do that. - Are you just... You know, I'm a professor, so I can kind of do what I want a little bit. - Yeah. That's good. - Yeah. - Good to see you. - Good to see you, too. Yeah, I kind of was. I asked Billie where you worked, and she told me. Fucking Billie. Yeah. I thought we should get a drink. I'm not drinking. - I know. - Okay. I thought... I thought you could watch me drink. Oh, that sounds so fun. Yeah. You know, you can have a... a virgin tequila and soda. They have that. A soda water? That's a so... Yeah, take the tequila away, that's a soda water. Yeah. Do you want to have a soda water and watch me drink? Um... My treat. Yeah. God, I mean, absolutely. I... - Okay. - would have to... - Just friends. - Yes. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Good. - Great. - Right. All right. - Good to see you. - And you. - See you soon. - See you later. See you later. I think he likes you. No. Do not, please. Do not tell Ingrid that that just happened. My lips are sealed. One sec. Sorry. That's all right. Is it important? You can take it. No, no. I'm turning it off. There you go. - Hi. - Hi. Just wanted to hang out? Yeah. I don't know. I felt like... you know, I just... I don't know. I don't know why. I just wanted to see you, and... I feel like you're something a little bit different to other people, and I wanted good conversation and... You know what? If you, like, stole a teenager's notebook, - opened it up... - Uh-huh. Uh-huh. and add, like, a little bit of form to it, that's... that's what my art looks like. That sounds cool. No, it's really not that great. That sounds really cool. I want to see it. Do you have any? I don't even know what I would have to show you. Um, oh, you know what? I have an Etsy shop. - You do? - I do. I-I used to be really into it. I'd buy, like, old ceramic teapots and plates and then paint on. - This is amazing. - Oh, come on. No, this is really great. It's fine. It's fine. No, I love it. - Okay. - This stuff, this is great. Thank you. I don't feel guilty that I'm not married. Don't feel guilty that I don't have kids. I don't feel guilty that maybe I don't want kids. You know, people put so much pressure on that shit these days, and it's like... - everyone's on their own path. - Mm. Doesn't mean that... that we're less adult. Maybe I-I'm jaded, and I don't feel like there is a world that exists where you can have that fire and have that comfort at the same time. You know, I like the kind of liberties that I have. I like that I'm not beholden to some person. I like that I don't have to wake up in the middle of the night. And who knows what... I'm at this very, very weird stage in my life where I feel like... Lighter. Stick around for this one. Um, I feel like I'm in a place where all I want to do is do the things that I should have done in my early 20s, like travel the world and explore new culture or maybe join the Peace Corps or... Yeah. I think there's something really important about... doing shit for others, and I don't really know what that looks like, but... that's the phase I'm in. I really want to talk much more about this... - Okay. - but I need to pee. - Okay. Go pee. - You gonna be okay without me? - Yeah. - Okay. - I'll survive. - Okay. - Hi. - Hello. Thank you. You're welcome. - Take care. - Yeah, you, too. Hi. Hi. Do you want a drink? Can I get a glass of water, please? Oh, that's right. I forgot. Still holding strong. Standing strong. Thank you. What's going on? I should be asking you that. I don't know what that means. No? No. Should I? I don't know. You're... You're kinda killing me. What are you talking about? You are. You're making me all crazy. I'm jealous. It's working, whatever you're doing. It's like... A little bit confused right now. My friend is Jack. He brought me to the New Year's party. - Oh. - Yeah. Okay. Jack's your friend. Yeah, he's my friend. I didn't know that. Sorry. You know what? I'm... I should not be fucking talking to either of you, to be honest. I'm trying to stay away from men and alcohol and everything else in my life. Probably shouldn't have even gone on a date with Jack. Yeah, but you're not really doing a good job of that, so let's just move on to the next thing. No, I'm not doing a good job of that. Um, here's the thing. I love Jack, and I'm not gonna, you know, do anything to fuck him over. I just can't. - Yeah. - You understand. Of course. I don't need to be a-a wedge in your friendship at all. Nah. It's gonna be all right. And I don't... I don't wanna deal with it, but I... but I do. I gotta deal with the fact that now I know you. Well, you don't really know me. Doesn't matter. I know you enough. Okay. So I should go. Yeah, you should... you should probably go. - Okay. - Okay. Bye. Bye. Bye. Thanks for the water. You're welcome. For the clarification. Thanks for coming. Yeah, I guess that's... that's it, huh? Goodbye. Hope everything works out. Yeah. No, it will. It'll be great. - Bye. - Bye. - Um... - Bye. Yeah. No, thank you. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Let me feel you. Where you going? There's this thing I do with my friends. It's called Still Life Club. We just, like, get together and paint and, I don't know, talk about life. I really gotta go. And it's... get together all the time? - Yeah, all the time. - And then what happens? Then we talk. All right, so can I come with you? No. I'm not getting off this floor until you come back. I'm just letting you know. I'm staying right here. You might be here for a very long time. Well, I'm serious. How's the six-month sabbatical going? Um... It, uh... it went. And it went well when it went. - Um... - Jeez. Okay, you definitely owe me 20 bucks, Ingrid. Oh, shut up. You guys bet on it? Yeah. I've, uh... But it's a good thing. It's a good thing. I'm... I'm really mindful of the dynamics at play. That's actually not true at all. I'm fucking... I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. - We're done talking about me. - No. I just came in here and stole the show. What's happening with Roxanne? What's going on with Graham? I'm still taking in what you're... The whole point was to change up the pattern, Daph. It didn't... it didn't feel right being alone. It didn't feel right not exploring - both of these people, you know? - Okay. All right. Well, there you go. Yeah. We'll see. Oh, my God. What the fuck? Hi. Who are you? Bart coming to say hello. You look a lot like your Dad. Oh, yeah. - What's his name? - What is it? Bart. - Bart. - Bartholomew. Ooh, Bartholomew. You're fancy. Ah, this is your book. Yeah. You have so many copies of it. Oh, they're in different languages. Bart looks terrified in this picture. No, no, no, no. That's... That's the look of love. No, it... he looks terrified. That's love. - Thank you. - You're welcome. No alcohol. - Uh, you know what? - Mm-hmm? I, um... I fell off the wagon. You did? - I did. - That's okay. I mean, life's short, right? - I agree. - Fuck it. To falling off the wagon. I must have smoked 40 cigarettes with you in two nights. Sorry. I don't usually smoke this much. If we spend more time together, one of us'll die. How's your job search going? That's what I wanna know. Oh, God. Ask my sister. It's not going well at all. Does she want you out? Probably, but I don't wanna leave. I feel like I gotta... talk to you about... whatever. Frank? Your... your relationship with him, the... Mm-hmm. And I didn't know that you guys were friends. - Okay. - Um... What do you wanna know? I don't know. I guess just the situation, - how you met. - Okay. Uh, if... I didn't... Yeah, I just wanna respect you and him and don't wanna blur any lines. Okay. Frank's one of my oldest friends. I met him 17 years ago when I moved here. You know, he's one of those people, he's the life and soul of every party, he's so fun, and you need him around most of the time, but then... Hmm? Then, you know... What? He's unreliable. He's volatile. He can be messy. He owes me money. But... I love him. I really do. I fucking love him. I feel like the last girlfriend he had, she kind of drowned in him. She drowned in him? Yeah. I realize now that's quite a weird way of putting it. - What does that mean? - I don't know. If you knew Frank, you'd understand. We were together for three years. We traveled everywhere together. We were in Senegal. We lived in Paris for a summer. She did a research fellowship in Amsterdam. I went to see her all the fucking time, and then we moved in together. I was there six months. We'd killed it. What happened? Do you really wanna know? I do, yeah. Uh, I saw some of her used dental floss on the side of the sink in the bathroom, and that was it. It was the nail in the coffin. I couldn't even look at her. I know exactly what you mean. - You do? - I do. I do. Fuck. We can't. Ah, fuck. Sorry. - That's okay. - I didn't know where to go. I'm gonna wash off some of these potential kids. Oh, creepy. - Huh? - Creepy. Sorry. Yeah? What'd you learn? About colors. - Ooh, you got to color? - Yeah. - That's pretty cool. - I drawed... Oh, can I have ice cream? Yeah, but it's really close to dinner, so you have to promise me not to tell your Mom. - I won't. Promise. - Okay. - Hi. - Hi. - How much is it? - Uh, $5.00. - One scoop? - Uh, yeah. - All right. - We'll just do... - Thank you. - Okay. Thank you. - Thank you so much. - Bye. What about your ice cream? What's that? Wait. What?! That was a great time at school. Whoa. No. Your sister living there for God knows how long! What does that have to do with anything?! The fact that she can slack off while I'm working every... Hey, you want to go paint? - Shall we go paint? Come on. - Okay. Let's go make some... Let's go make something for Mommy and Daddy. Well, that's nice. Was this yours? Your mother's? Was my mother's. Was not really a wedding ring, anyway. Was more of a token of my Dad's guilt. He had another family. You sure you wanna sell it? Yeah, I'm sure. Thanks. - Thank you. - You're welcome. "D. One day, you'll discover this note when you least expect it. And I hope you'll take a minute and remember who we were together... We found each other in this life, and we'll find each other in the next. Love, A." Thanks again so much. - Anytime. - See you soon. - All right. - Get home safe. - Thanks. - Bye. Hey, stranger. Uh, we miss you at work. Wish you hadn't left us. Um, I hope it has nothing to do with that night. You and I were wasted. It was fun, though. Don't worry. I-I didn't tell anyone. I know it's weird since I'm your boss. Don't want you to be embarrassed. Anyway, um... - Adriana's? - Mm. I have not been paying attention. I can tell that you weren't paying attention. - I, however... - You're so distracting. I know everything that's happening. What's happening? They are on this holiday, trying to make shit right, but... You're completely making this up, huh? Why don't we just cover the subtitles? We can just make our own film. Okay. You be him. No, you be him. Gloria! You're her. You're her. Oh, shit. Yeah, Juan, stop fucking calling my name. I'm not called Gloria. Oh. What's your name again? - Stephanie. - Oh, fuck. That's right, Steph. - Who the fuck's Gloria? - Stephie. Mm. Indian food on my face? There was Indian food on your face. - Thank you. - You're welcome. There's just an openness when it comes to relationships that I think Americans don't tend to have - or they're scared of. - Mm-hmm. Where you can have, like, the whole "Father of the Bri..." Have you seen that movie, "Father of the Bride"? Yeah, I've seen "Father of the Bride." - Steve Martin. - Yeah. But the idea of having a big family and people to take care of you and look out for you and all of that is so appealing. So appealing, but then... - this passion... - Mm-hmm. I feel like that gets lost in the sidelines when you have the... I mean, it blows my mind. I think that's what makes you amazing. You're great. You know that? You're great. - Jesus Christ. - Aww. Fucking cardigan. So I'm thinking that I should have a dinner party before I go to Philadelphia next week. That's a great idea. Um, do you think it's weird if I invite Frank? It's kind of awkward if I don't, because he's looking after Bart. Well, I can look after Bart. Mm. Frank likes doing it. I'll just stay here. I mean, I'd take him to my apartment, but no-pet policy. Frank actually uses Bart to pick up girls in the park, so I think he's gonna be pretty happy. Anything else happen with you two that night? No. You guys don't still talk or text? No. You wanna do it? No, go for it. I have feta hands. Okay. Yeah. Whew. - Okay, let's eat. - Please. It all looks great. That's like a thing right now. I was screwed. I had a smoking mommy and a sugar dad. There was no love. Wait. You guys are sisters, right? We're half... we're halfsies. - We're sisters. We're sisters. - We're sisters. We have the same Mom, but different Dads. I can see the similarities. She's funnier. Actually, we're gonna build a hot tub. When we're ready, we're gonna build a hot tub. Open your eyes, everyone. - Aww. - Aww. Somebody was murdered. - What? - Massacred. - What?! - Slain... in the middle of the night. Good night, my dear. - No! - What?! - Daphne, are you dead? - Did you kill me? - Daphne, you're gone. - You'll never know. - She's gone. - Who killed me? Okay, do we want to nominate who we think might be Mafia? It's the guy dressed in all black. - R-Really? - Is it you? Yeah. You look like a Mafia guy. - Are you Mafia? - That's not... I've been very helpful, I'd say, this entire game, pointing at people. Yes, I have. Do we want to kill him or save him? - Kill him. - He's Mafia. - That's one, two, three, four... - Jonathan. five, six. Wow, a lot of suspicion. He was... a townsperson. - No! - No! - Oh, I'm so sorry. - Aw, it's all good. - Plot twist. - Sorry. Everyone, close your eyes. It's what it is, you know? - Mafia... - Hmm? you dirty devils, wake up. Who would you like to kill? Good morning. Everyone wake up. I'm so sorry we have another death in the middle of the night. I'm so sorry. Karma's a bitch. - There is... - I'm so sorry. a baby inside of my body. We'll take it out. Don't worry. We had two murders. You horrifying humans. Ah, dude, good to see you, man. Thank you, man. Thank you for having us. Drive safe, okay? Bye. Yeah, that's definitely that guy. Do people actually buy photos of other people at garage sales? I wonder if he knows that these are even in here. This would look cute over your belly. - You think? Ooh, elastic. - In a little while. It's gonna keep growing and growing. That's cute. And also do a little bit of this. Ah, there you go. You guys missing me in your pool house? Shut up. So what's happening? Nothing. Everything. Look, you're never gonna find the person that gives it all to you, so you just have to find the person that gives you enough of it. What if you find two people that give you two different sides of it? Yeah. Do you see your future in there? Whose face do you see? I just see a bunch of skulls. Do you see Frank's huge penis in that kaleidoscope? Oh, God. I feel like maybe Adrian was the one and I should have just stuck it out and... I don't know. Hi. Hi. How you doing? Good. I'm just... painting Billie's baby shower gift. That's 100% the most beautiful teapot I've ever seen - in my life. - Oh, come on. How's Philly? Philly's been incredible. I was on this amazing panel today about creative destruction. And the writer Kazantzakis... and he says basically this idea that destruction is a prerequisite for creative activity. How fucking cool is that? Tell me more. What else is happening over there? Um, I found out that I'm a finalist for this fellowship in Rome, which, I don't know, could be amazing. Hi. I'm sorry. You gotta take him. - I can't take the dog. - Really sorry. Please take him. - I can't take the dog. - No, you will take him. - My building won't let me. - Because I can't have him. - What are you doing? - And he wants to be with you. - He really wants to be here. - Are you fucking crazy? What are you doing? Take the fucking dog. Sorry. I tried. I couldn't. It was fucking... Where... Come with me. You're gonna forget me in life, aren't you? You know what? You're... You're gonna forget me next week. That's what's gonna happen. It's okay if you do. I could just stare at you for fucking... I mean, you're gonna end up seeing some stuff if you do. You gotta turn it up a little more. - How you doing? - Oh, my God! What's up? - Oh, my God. - Wow, look at you. - It's so good to see you. - You look... This is Daphne. - My friend, Sydney. - Hi. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. - Jezebel. What's yours? - Jezebel. Okay. - Hey. - Hi, guys. - Hey! - I-I'm Daphne. So I bring them out here to this house. Ready for the night. I would say... I would say anything's possible. The Romans were... were wise. H-Hello, baby. - Cheers. - Thank you for having us. - Cheers! - Cheers to Bart. - You're the man. - Yeah. - It's nice to see you. - Whose dog is this? That's my friend Jack's dog. - Okay. - Yeah.

We've already eaten, but there's really good... Jen made a great kale salad, so... - Yeah. - Okay. So yeah. So at least you had, like, a time, you know? - Yeah. - A place where they... - Who's the Lindsay Lohan? - Billie's sister. Oh, yeah. Wait. She was in the guesthouse. She was supposed to be here, like, two hours ago. - Really? - She's always been such a mess. Can you imagine having a sister like that? It's a very nice image, you reading my book. I fucking missed you when I was away. I missed you, too. Feel like I want to call us something. Don't be sca... You look scared. I don't mean to scare you. What I mean, like in a, uh... a different way to what other people say. It doesn't have to be boyfriend, girlfriend, doesn't have to be anything traditional. It's just... Just feels right. I like that. Yeah? Mm. I just don't get it. It's like one minute, I'm having a panic attack, and the next, I'm high on the chaos. Maybe you wanna rethink the whole sabbatical thing. Fuck, no. Nothing good happens when I'm alone. Trust me. How would you know? You've never done it. I-I know. It shouldn't be that hard. That's not making me feel any better. I'm not trying to make you feel better. I keep thinking about this night. It happened a while ago when Adrian was out of town... when we all went out dancing, the staff from the Center. Remember we used to go to the Rabbit Hole every Thursday? Mm-hmm. We were so fucked up. What happened? That's a very good question. - Hi. - Hi. I have an idea. Uh-oh. - You ready? - Yeah. - Hi. - Hi. Think we should go dancing tonight. - Okay. Yeah. - Yeah? - I think it could be really fun. - Yeah. You ever seen me dance? No, I haven't. You're in for such a treat. - Oh, I can't wait. - Yeah. It was a great idea. It's gonna be fun. Can I get us drinks? Uh-huh. Let's go! Let's go! - We're fine. We're fine. - I got her. Maybe just take me home. Nah, my place is super close by. Jed, stop. Stop. Shh, shh, shh. It's all right. I can't. What? - Thank you. - Hey. - Can we go? - You wanna go? Yeah. Is that okay? I know that's weird, but... - is that all right? - Okay. Yeah. - I know... - Okay. So are we gonna talk about why we left so fast? Just starving. That's it? Yeah. Just hungry. Hi. Okay. Some very plain toast. Mmm. How you feeling? - Pretty shitty. - Yeah? My class starts in 40 minutes. I'm gonna have to go. Yeah, of course. I'll bring you some soup. Sleep. Woot, woot, woot. "I call her when I get home. I don't know what to say to him, so I just hold the receiver to my ear for a minute and listen to him and say, 'Hello.'" Hello. Okay. - Hi. - Hi. So we're gonna have a little celebration, 'cause I got some pretty fucking good news. - Yeah? - Yeah. I got the Bella Costa Fellowship in Rome, five months, leaving in August. How cool is that? Cheers. Cheers. Wow. I know. It's... feels like a long time, but I think you could come out, like, every... every month conceivably. That is so amazing. You've worked so hard for that. What's going on? Wh-What's wrong? Nothing. I'm just... I'm just processing it. It's really... I'm really proud of you. Thanks. Tell me more. - If we're in Rome... - Mm-hmm. we can go to the opera. We can eat pasta in bascaiola. Mm-hmm. Get out of the city one day and take bicycles and cycle in the vineyards and drink wine. Get back on the bikes... So we got the results back from the ultrasound, and the baby is measuring about half an inch, so that means you are spot on. You're about six weeks. You are still early in the pregnancy, so terminating the pregnancy... Whew. - Hi. - Hi. Well, I had quite the day... yet again. Jack, I'm pregnant. Hey. Hey. That's great. That's great. Hey, that's fucking great. Huh? That's so exciting. Oh, my God. It's okay. Hmm? I need to tell you something. What is it? Come on. Um... Uh... I... Daphne, come on. What is it? When you were out of town, I went to Big Sur... with Frank. So this is Frank's kid? No. I don't know. I don't know. - You don't know? - I don't know. That's great. I should have told you. What? You're so fucking sloppy. For fuck's sake, Daphne, you can't make such a mess of everything and use it as an excuse for everything in your life. This is a fucking baby! Ah, fuck. I think you should go. You should go. I'm just so fucking stupid. Like really? Okay, well, it's not your finest hour. I have this baby. This baby will... God, I would be such a shitty mom. You know what I think? I think you're gonna have a great life if you have this baby. And I think you have a great life if you don't have this baby. I think you have more power than you know. I just don't know how to say no. I don't know how to stop. I don't know how to just fucking be okay with whatever... I have. I just don't think you understand. - What? - I don't think you understand who's next in line to be loved by you. The baby. It's you. I think for most of my life, I've used my childhood as an excuse for my behavior and my Mom. But, um... just tired. I'm tired of hurting people. It's just the same thing, and I'm just so tired. And the idea of having to unlock all that shit is fucking terrifying... but I am going to. And, again, I don't... You know, I don't need anything from you, and I don't... definitely don't expect anything from you. Okay. I don't know how that makes me feel. Like, I know when I have this baby, if I've... That's weird. Even if... if I have this baby, that, uh... I... you know, I'm not gonna know how to do things, and it's not gonna magically change my life. But I do think that it's given me a reason to look at things differently and to... just fucking be a better person. I think it's great that you're saying all this. And... I wouldn't be here if I didn't want to hear you say it.

Why aren't you dancing? I'm... I'm good. I'm just watching. Just wanted you to come up and be with us. Mom, please, please. I just... Please let me sit. You're hurting my hand. Come on. Come on. I don't want you to embarrass me. Mom, please, please. Just let me... I want you out there with your sister and... Can I not... not dance and still have a good time? What's going on with you? Huh? Nothing. I'm fine. Just... I'm good. What's going on with you? Nothing. I'm fine. I didn't feel like dancing. That's it. No, everything clearly is not fine. You just stormed out of there... - Mom, I didn't wanna dance. - like I did something wrong. I don't know what else you want from me. I'm here. I'm sorry that I can't give you what you need. I am so proud of you, Daphne. - Mom. - I am in awe of you. - Do you hear me? - I'm happy for you, Mom. I don't think that you understand why I went from guy to guy, as you say. It... I... My whole life, I've been trying to create something that was stable and sound and... and I, granted, made some bad choices. It's okay. But it was for... It was for my daughters. That was the whole reasoning behind it. Do... do you believe me? Center for Progress in the Arts. Hi. Um, Helen Crawford, please. Hello. Hi, Helen. Uh, it's Daphne Mirador. I used to work at Center for Progress. Of course. Daphne. Uh, I was sorry to hear about you leaving. Yeah, me, too. Um, it's actually why I'm calling. Uh, I... I know that you had H.R. over there, um, a-and... this is not an easy conversation to have. Uh, I just want you to know that I loved my job and I didn't want to leave, but something happened that... made me feel like I had to, and I would like to explain why. You can tell me anything. Thank you. Hey. - Hi. - Hi. How you doing? How... I mean, how far along are you? 5 1/2 months. I tried calling you a few times. No, I-I know. I'm sorry. I-I wanted... You know, I wanted to reach out, uh, but, um... It's fine. So you're good? Y-You're good. You're... - Things are good. - I'm okay. Yeah. Okay is good. Uh, I assume Jack called you. No. No, we're not, um... we're not talking, actually, anymore. Uh... Was... It's just other stuff. - Hey. - Hi. Um, this is Daphne... - Hi. - and this is Lila. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. All right. It was really nice to see you. Is it mine? I don't know. I mean, I... "I don't know" is like... What am I supposed to do with that? She's mine. "She"? She. Oh, God. That's great. That's really... Yeah, that's... You know, that scares me. Girls... girls scare me. Just another... Just another you to burn down the planet. It's amazing. I don't know what I'm gonna do with her, but I'm gonna figure it out. I mean, it's gonna be great. You know, you gotta... you gotta teach her the basics, you know... depression, anxiety... you know, being hung-over, and... yeah. Gotta teach her to paint. You gotta read her stories, you know, but the right kind of stories. You gotta tell her the truth. You gotta tell her... You know, you gotta... I want to be a Dad, you know? I do. Do you want to feel her? That's crazy. It's like magic. You loved me then, but I'm feeling it now. It's so weird. Feels like a star's light, how it takes a long time to get where it's going. But it's here. I feel it. You loved me when I wasn't going to love myself. You're amazing. And I want you to be happy. Love, Daph. Hi. Oh, what's going on, dude? - How are you? - Good, man. Um, is Adrian around? Oh, no. He's, uh, touring India and Africa with Lanie, said he wouldn't back for, like, six months or something. So... Wow. That's cool. He'd always wanted to do that. Yeah, man. Good for him. Well, can I leave this here for him? - Yeah, I can give it to him. - All right. - Thank you. - All right. - Good to see you. - Yeah, good to see you, too. I was so little. You were so tiny, and now you have feet like mine. Where did you buy these things? These are incredible. Sweetie, I didn't buy them. I-I made these. Look. - You made these? You sewed them? - This is so not great. No, are you kidding? This is incredible. I can't wait to put my little one in it. Well, honey, you don't have to do that. - You're gonna... - No, I want to. It's so special. I would love that. It would mean the world to me. You know, Daph, um... if there's anything that I can do for you, anything at all, um, you know, if... if you would like to stay with Carl and me for a while, you know, just... just so you don't have to... do this all on your own. And I could baby-sit. - I would love that. - I mean, if you don't - want me to, I completely... - I would love that. Thank you. Oh, wait. Look. I mean, physically I'm just so ready, so ready. And mentally, I'm just... not ready. Imagine that you're in a field of flowers. You can feel the warmth on your skin from the sun. You look forward, and you notice there's a door. So you walk over to that door, but the handle's locked. You have the keys. You've always had them. So you open the door. A huge beam of bright light shines on you. Everything might not be okay... but that's okay. You're exactly where you need to be. You are loved.
