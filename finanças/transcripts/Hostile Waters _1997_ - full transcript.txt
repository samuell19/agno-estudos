Hey! Next time, it'll be your fingers. Captain to crew. Silent running. Missile targeting routine about to commence. Hey. Piss off. Shh! Sonar? Sonar clear, Captain. Scope? Scope clear, Captain. Petya? We have a fix, Captain. Updating missile tracking system now. OK. You know the routine. Starting to lock into the East Coast targets. Washington locked. Ballast in order, Pumps? Good. Conditions are good. Gena, I said, silent running. Shut up. Shh, shh, shh. Philadelphia locked. Missile problem? No. Small fuel leak. Patching it up. New York locked. Thomas, get some R and R, and I'll see you tomorrow morning. Yes, sir. See you, guys. Baker. Thanks. Reagan and Gorbachev are gonna freeze their butts off in Iceland. There's no point in negotiating, anyway. Just wait a while. Russia's gonna self-destruct. We've been waiting for that for a long time. Pulling the nukes so the North Atlantic is on the table for the summit. We could be out of a job. I think can think of better ways to serve my country than baby-sitting boomers. I've got a boomer. Where is it? He's dead ahead, about 3,000 yards. Move us in closer. Put us tight within his wash. Captain, there's something behind us. Sounds like a target. The screw's breaking up the signal. Stop the engines. He's slowing, sir. He may be on to us. Cut the engine. This is the captain. Attention, all hands. Ultra quiet, please. I say again, ultra quiet. Thank you. Sonar? Negative, Captain. Boston locked. Missile tracking complete. Ahead ten knots. Left full rudder. Left full rudder. She's banking left, Captain. Follow her, sir? No. We stay put. Crazy Ivan coming up. She's going to double-back. This is the captain. All hands stand by for Crazy Ivan. Stand by for Crazy Ivan. Say again, Sonar. She's diving, sir. Still turning to port. Disengage the screw. Screw disengaged, sir. Volodya, take over. I'll do the key drill now. Warn the KGB. Readiness to condition two. Pshenichny, report for key drill. Any more tricks, you eat shit for the rest of your trip. That is unusual. Good morning. Oh, yeah. Morning. How was your watch? OK. Any problems? Well, fuel leak in missile tube 13. Will we manage? I taped it, Captain. Be all right for the time being. How's your eye? It's OK. This is a good time for you to see the doctor. And keep an eye on that leak, the good eye. Morning, Captain. All right, lads. Morning, Captain. Pshenichny, report for key drill. Good morning, Pshenichny. How are things in Moscow? Catch you at a bad time? I was shaving. Engine's restarted, sir. She's off our port beam and circling. Range - 900 yards. What's our speed? We're at ten knots. Very well. Morning, Doctor. Morning, Captain. No one in sick bay? No. I don't know how you do it. Whatever it is, keep it up. Lieutenant, please confirm that I am inspecting the nuclear key held by Captain Britanov. Yes. This is to confirm that I am inspecting the nuclear key held by Security Officer Pshenichny. I didn't know he played. Lieutenant, will you confirm that the key is in good order and secure? Yes. Doctor, please confirm this key is in good order and secure. Yes. Good. Captain, I know it's none of my business, but Pshenichny feels that you ignore him. Every time you meet, you just say, "How's Moscow?" I know he's KGB, but... That's all right. I'll keep that in mind. Be nice to Comrade Pshenichny. You smell nice, comrade. How are things in Moscow? 360 complete. Are we clear? Nothing to our front, sir. What's the course? 0-2-2 Increase speed to 15 knots. Increase speed 15 knots. Increase speed to 15 knots. Thank you. Where is she, Sonar? It's The Crazy Ivan - he's turning up so much water, I can't make out the signal. I understand. Now give us your best shot. She's behind us. She's below us. She's heading this way. Let's get a mark before we lose her. 5, 4, 3, 2, now. 1,000 yards and closing on the port quarter. Where the hell is she? Captain. Yes? She's right underneath. Hold your course. We've been hit. We've been hit. That was a contact. Stabilize the ship. Blow the ballast tanks. Pumps. Blow those ballast tanks. Captain, she's dropping away. I didn't see that, sir. Do you see it now? Yes, sir. I have a submarine right on top of us. Take us up 20 meters. He's right on top of us. Incline plane 15 degrees. Up. Come on! Incline plane 15 degrees. Captain, she's coming up again. Engage the screw. Left full rudder. Bear away. Left full rudder and bear away. That guy really was pissed. He's not the only one. Damage? Nothing recorded... as yet. Sonar, where are they now? Going to port, sir. Keep it steady at 40 meters. Depth - 40 meters. Key in a new course and speed. Depth - 40 meters. What are you thinking? We scared the shit out of ' em. Hey. Take that to the doctor. And don't spill it. Wait for me. I'll see you later. Compliments of the galley, sir. Thank you, Sergei. Just put it down there. You should be on watch, Preminin. I was just fetching the doctor his tea, sir. We hit something. A dead whale. An American submarine. It's OK. Wash it out in salt water. Pshenichny, you' re full of shit. That story's going to go round the boat in no time. Thanks, Doctor. Masks on now! What? Close the hatch. Kolya, this is the captain. Come in. Captain, we have a major leak inside of 13. Water is mixing with the missile fuel causing the gas to build up. It'll blow any minute. Men to silo. Open 13! Yes, sir. Open 13! Which way now? What's that? OK. This is the captain. Easy does it. Damage control officers prepare your forts. I say again, damage control officers... Captain. Stand by. Yes, Sonar. Explosion was on the other craft, sir. Thank you, Sonar. Captain, we've lost missile 13. Missile bay. Kolya. Anyone. Pumps. Yes. Blow all ballasts from the forward tanks. Yes, sir. Missile bay, report to the bridge. Petrachkov. Open it. Open it! Missile bay, report to the bridge. Masks on! Missile bay, what is your status? Say the word! Reverse propellers now! Yes, Captain! Pull out the ballast. Yes, Captain. Up plane to 25. Tell the captain what's going on. This is the captain. Captain! This is Sergei Preminin! Sergei, calm down. This really looks bad! There's smoke everywhere! Where's Kolya? He's collapsed, sir. The smoke's deadly! Men are dropping like flies! Evacuate the compartment quick as you can. Yes, sir! Evacuate! Evacuate! How's she doing, Sonar? Leveling out, sir. All right. Let's stay well clear. They' re coming around. Gena! Ahead full power! Disengaging... now. Captain, do you intend to surface? Because right now, we don't have any way of controlling the ascent. Yes, I intend to surface. Captain to crew. Hold tight. They' re going up. Thank God for that. I mean really up. They're going to surface. Say again, Sonar. They're surfacing, Captain. I don't believe it. Where are they, Sonar? 10:00, heading nor' - nor' east. Captain. My God, a boomer on the surface. If I wasn't seeing it with my own eyes, I wouldn't believe it. Go ahead, Jack. Christ. It's a huge mother. Anything? Nothing. I can't even see the surface. There's too much smoke. Sonar? Yes, Captain. I have a Los Angeles class attack submarine on the port quarter at 1,000 meters. They have no shame. Check on deck. See what damage we have. Pshenichny... where are you? Captain, I'm in compartment five. There's fumes everywhere. How's Kolya? He's dead. Anyone else? Rikov and Mirov. Evacuate them to six. Pshenichny, I'm putting you in charge of the aft section. I'm KGB, Captain, not a sailor. The explosion has cut this boat in half. I need a senior officer to take 'em out of the aft section, and that is you. Yes, sir. I'll send someone over as soon as I can. And I need to know exactly what happened in the missile bay. And get some engineers and start ventilation. Yes, sir. Preminin. Yes, sir. Locate the engineers. The captain needs a damage report on the missile bay. You know how to vent to atmosphere? Yes, sir. You go in with them. Evacuate the rest to six. Yes, sir. Reactor room report, please. Reactor room. Captain, this is Belikov. Yes? Both reactors are on-line. No sign of damage. Good. Check the backup systems. Yes, sir. Pumps, how much water did we take on? At a guess, I would say... about 70 tons. Petya, mark that down. 70 tons... 70 tons... in 15 minutes... in 15 minutes... 40 meters depth. 40 meters depth. Captain, this is Pshenichny. They're going in now. OK, Preminin, go up and open the vent. Captain, this is Casparian. I'm in the missile bay. Go ahead. There's a mass of missile fuel leaking from tube 13. And we've got sparks flying from power cables. This place might go up any minute. Check the other tubes for damage. All right. What are the chances of pumping out the fuel? If it's sludge, It won't pump. It'll burn like hell. What about the fumes it creates? If we can't contain them, the whole ship will be contaminated. And if it builds up, the whole of the missile bay could blow. Not only will we be vaporized, but the entire eastern seaboard of the United States will feel the heat. So what's your solution? Burn off the fumes before they explode. I can't set fire to a compartment full of missiles. Captain, this is Volodya. I'm on deck. There's no way to get the crew up here. There's gas everywhere. All right. Come back down here. If the fuel ignites, how long would it burn? 15, 20 hours, minimum. Short of flooding the bay, there's no way of stopping it once it starts. We can't hold out that long. We don't have enough oxygen. Captain... Captain, this is Casparian. There's fire on the module. Tigran, get out of there. Fire! Get out! Now we have your fire. Get back in the hole. Make sure you keep the reactors running. Yes, sir. We'll need the power. Sergei! Sergei! Leave! We're getting out! Wait! I've nearly got it open! Sergei! Sergei! Sergei! It's open! Is the vent open? Yes. Good lad. Sir... I plotted a sub bay close to Havana. We'll be there within 48 hours. No, we're going to head north. I'm turning around. I see. Course and speed? .5- 3-0 Steer 0-3-5. Course 0-3-5. Full ahead. Speed, full ahead. Speed, full ahead. She's moving north. Making a lot of smoke. What's your assessment, Jack? She's on fire. Explosion of that magnitude in mid-ships must have ruptured the fuel lines. God knows what. I think we should... alert command. We can't break radio silence. Yeah, but... if they can't control that blaze... ...if she stays on the surface, anything could happen, even a meltdown. We're less than 500 miles off the eastern seaboard, for Christ sake. The trade winds would carry the fallout straight to the coast. Come on, Jack. You know procedure as well as I do. If Command wants to know what the hell's going on up there, they got ways of finding out. But, sir... Enough. I cannot break radio silence. I'll be in my cabin. X.O. Has the con. I've got the con. Which one? The next one. 33? Is that all? Captain, we've just counted the oxygen containers. We've only got 33 that work. That's less than an hour supply. We've 60 men in here. We'll have to move them back to six. No one moves. I don't think you understand, Captain. The fire spread to five, the lower level is in flames. The upper level is full of smoke. Pshenichny, you will fight the fire at all costs. You're too close to the reactor, it mustn't spread. Yes, sir. The fire is in the missile bay. The heat is such that it could trigger the launch of one of the nuclear missiles. It's a remote possibility, I grant you. But it's one you should be aware of, as they are targeted at the United States. No, we are doing everything we can, General Secretary. We have ships on the way and an air drop of oxygen. The commander - his name is Britanov. What is he like? He's a submariner, that's what he's like. They're all the same. Stuck up, self-confident, usually a pain in the backside. Yes, I think you should inform the Americans, if for no other reason than they probably know already. Yes, Governor General Secretary, of course I will keep you informed. Yeah. Sit down, Captain. He says he won't call Washington unless the situation is serious and when he does, it will be to tell them it isn't. That, he says, is what politicians are for. He says we are to remember one word - Reykjavik. Gentlemen, this is Captain Kuzmenko. The Captain was Britanov's number two during his last two missions. Can I ask what the situation is? Britanov's on the surface about 300 miles east of Bermuda. He's heading north about ten knots. He's asked for oxygen bottles to be air dropped as a matter of urgency. That's all we get from him. With a fire in the missile bay, he'll be pretty busy. The entire technical staff of the Northern Fleet has been assembled to give him advice. How can we if he doesn't tell us what's gone wrong? Admiral, with respect, we're talking about a man who lives and breathes submarines. If he needs advice, he will ask for it. What are his problems? First, how to contain the fire before it reaches the reactors. And second... remote as it may seem, can he stop the missiles blasting through their hatches and destroying America? But can he handle a crisis of this magnitude? You mean is he likely to lose his nerve? He's the best man you could have in the situation. But Cuba's only two days away. Any officer with even a modicum of sense would plot a southerly course for Havana. Why is Britanov heading north? Well, Captain? He's making for deeper water. It's obvious he fears the worst. I got another Soviet ship changing course here. Coming out of Havana. That's got to be the Krasny-Omirsky. She's in a hurry. She always is on a Friday night. Crew gets drunk, boards late, then goes like hell to make up the time. Maybe. But she's the third Soviet ship in the last hour to change course. Log and compute the new course and speed. Good. Now put it on the table. Realign the other two Soviet ships that changed course earlier. Extend their tracks. What is it? I'm not sure. Guys, check any traffic going in and out of the Bermuda Box, any Soviet ship that's changed course within the last few hours and extend their tracks now. Yes, ma'am. Holy shit. Come on! Pumps! Yes, Captain. It might be good to put some water on that wall. Yeah. We have a message from Moscow, sir. Air drop of oxygen on its way. Do they say when? No. Good morning, sir. Morning. Good morning, sir. Good morning. What have we got? Every Soviet ship in the North Atlantic altered course just after midnight. All heading for this spot. We picked up one of its subs, a boomer in the area, yesterday, and we're pretty sure that's where they' re heading. This degree of response indicates that it has to be in real trouble. All right. Call the White House situation room, brief them on what we've got. I'll talk to the Joint Chiefs. Barry, call my home, give my compliments to my wife. Ask her to send my uniform. The Krasny-Omirsky just altered course, sir. And the Pushkin off of St. Georgia's bank. If you retriangulate, you can get a new intersection somewhere... here. So the boomer's moving north. What's her speed? It averages out at 11 knots, sir. Even a damaged sub would be able to travel at twice that speed. Unless she's on the surface. Clive, call the chief of Naval Operations. Request we go to threat con bravo. Sir. And get me a P-3 off the ground from Bermuda. Let's get some photos. See what the hell we've got here for sure. Keep the hose steady! Get out of here! Get out! Captain, this is Belikov from five. We're losing control. The fire is so intense, we can't get near the missile bay, and it's burning fast! Get your men to six. Back to six! Back to six! Don't waste your time. Come on! Come on! Why are we always waiting for you, Preminin? Go. We have confirmation. There's a boomer on the surface, just outside the Bermuda Box. Where the hell's the Bermuda Box? Piece of ocean about 800 miles east of Miami. Morning, Larry. Admiral. Gentlemen. White House send you down to make sure we don't start World War III, huh? That's about it, sir. We got Reykjavik coming up. It's very important to the President. Let me bring you up to speed. Have a seat. Thanks. These are the photos that have been transmitted from the P-3. As you can see, it's a boomer. It's on fire. You can see the smoke trailing from the vents and from a missile hatch which appears to be missing. Missing? How? We don't know. He could've launched to wreck your summit. If he launched, he didn't hit anything. He's on the surface, which means he could still launch his payload in what? Five minutes. You hear anything from Moscow? Not a word. Well, Larry, I suggest that you contact your boss, ask him to call Moscow, find out what the hell is happening. Admiral, you have to understand the political situation is awfully delicate at the moment. We're days away from what may be an historic... Lieutenant. Sir. Will you explain to Mr. Brock what's at stake here? Yes, sir. This is a cutaway of a boomer. This is the missile bay where we believe the fire is burning. As you can see, she's carrying 16 missiles, each armed with two six-megaton warheads capable of reaching Boston, New York, Washington and as far inland as Philadelphia or Atlanta. Jesus. Could the fire cause the missiles to launch? If it gets hot enough in the missile bay, it's a definite possibility. The ship is powered by two nuclear reactors which are in close proximity to the missile bay. If the fire spreads to the reactor room, there could be a meltdown. That's a total of over 200 megatons, a thousand times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb. You're assuming all their safeguards could fail. In the case of a catastrophic fire, yes. He's moving northeast into deeper water. We assume that the captain is considering scuttling, if necessary. That brings most of New England into a fallout footprint. Fallout footprint? The radioactive cloud that would drift with the wind if she goes. Have we got a sub in the area? The Aurora. She's standing off at full combat readiness. Listen, Larry. Any way you cut it, this submarine represents a clear and present danger to the safety of this country. You've got to alert the President. If she makes any move which might be interpreted as a strike, we must authorize the Aurora to sink her instantly, and you should let the Soviets know. I'll talk to Washington. Gentlemen, we haven't been able to contain the fire. This leaves us with two options. A - we abandon ship and get picked up by the Americans. The implications for Moscow, in that event, need no further explanation. B - we open some of our missile hatches, execute a short dive. The amount of water we would take on board will extinguish the fire, but there's a chance that it also might take us to the bottom. The only way we can stop the water from overwhelming us is by regaining the surface. We would have to claw our way up. We'd have to stabilize the boat second by second. I don't want to mislead you. This maneuver has not been attempted before. I think it can be done, but I need to make a decision. Now, option A - Abandon ship and get picked up by the Americans. B - open our missile hatches and dive. Petya, send a message to Moscow. Let them know what we intend to do. Yes, sir. Normally, I would treat this as the product of a deranged mind, but perhaps you can help me. He wants to dive the submarine with the hatches open. He's running out of options. So he's decided on mass suicide. No, sir. There are 16 hatches open. That's exactly what's going to happen. Well, maybe he should try eight. Four... for not longer than three minutes at a depth of 20 meters. During that time, he should take onboard enough water to compress the fire against the ceiling of the lower level without compromising the buoyancy. But even with the remotest possibility of surviving such a dive, the Americans will construe the raising of the missile doors as preparation for a launch. They will have to sink it. I don't think they're that stupid. Would you take the risk if you thought an American submarine was going to launch? You wouldn't hesitate, would you? Neither would you, Admiral. But we'd be relying on instinct. Not so, the Americans. Maybe you're right, Captain, but even if you are wrong, I suppose we have no choice. Abandoning ship and allowing the crew to be rescued by the Americans - that's not an option. We're in business. Prepare to dive. Open the missile hatches. Fetch the skipper, sailor. On the double. Evans. Sir. Move in close. Something's going on. Aye, sir. Captain has the con. What's the situation, Jack? They're opening the missile doors. Helm, take us to primary attack position. Coming into attack position... now, sir. This is the captain. In a few moments, we will start a dive to 20 meters with the missile hatches open. This way, we're hoping to kill the fire. Engineers in Moscow advise us to stay under no longer than three minutes. Just to be safe, we will take only two. Be on your posts. Be ready. What's our speed, please? Speed - 13 knots. Heading? Heading - 0-9-0. Arm and compute both port and both starboard torpedoes. Block hatches in the open position. Can't do, sir. Comrade, override the safety system. Yes, sir. The bow planes have assumed diving position. I say again, arm and compute both port and starboard torpedoes. Increasing speed. Flood the tubes, but do not open the doors. Vents. Open all vents. Baffles. Clear baffles. Captain, submarine on port beam at 1,500 meters. Torpedoes are armed and tubes flooded. Take us down. 20 meters? Dive to 20 meters, 2-0. Dive to 20 meters, 2-0. Pumps. This is the captain speaking. All hands, now hear this. Assume alert status one, battle stations. This is not a drill. I say again, battle stations. This is not a drill. What's she doing? She's submerging. With his doors open? Bow planes to 15. Bow planes down 15 degrees. Bow planes down 15 degrees. Stern planes to zero. Stern planes to zero. Holy Christ, it's a launch. Sonar, active! Sonar to active. Sonar to active. Two pings. Open torpedo doors. Starboard torpedo doors open. There's been no ignition, skipper. Prepare to fire starboard "A" torpedo. Captain to crew, two minutes. Active sonar coming this way, two pings. They're telling us to back off. Torpedo ready, sir. They're trying to put that fire out. Negative. They're trying to launch a goddamn missile! There are no goddamn missiles. Missiles are still in place. They're flooding the missile bays to try to put the fire out. Bullshit! Who the hell in their right mind would do that? He's desperate... sir. Sonar. Still no launch. I'll be a son of a bitch. 90 seconds. Masks! Masks on! Lights! I need lights! Lights, quickly! I'm coming! 60 seconds! Hold on! ...8,9,10 ...6,7 ...3,4,5 Bow planes, 25 degrees! Take her up now! Llya, take her up! Now! Up! Up! Captain. Yes, Sonar. Target's resurfaced. Is everyone all right? Good. Masks off. Well done, Pumps. Good work. Pshenichny, this is your captain. Take your men to compartment eight. The fire is out. Come on. Get a move on. Come on. Hurry up. Did you count them? They're all here. Good. Close it up. Sir. Everyone, check your oxygen. Oxygen off. Pshenichny here. We are all in eight. The reactor room is sealed off. Thank you. Where are the rescue ships? Coming closer, sir. We have the Krasny-Omirsky on-screen. I'd like to evacuate most of the men. We'll just keep a small crew until we've vented the whole ship. OK. Gena, what's the problem now? Controls to the reactors, they're not responding. The cables must have burnt through. Backup systems? Gone. Cooling? Down. Pumps are not functioning, but we're still getting fission. The situation is getting critical. We need to get someone down there to lower those rods. Yes, Captain. Tell the ships to hold off. How far? Ten K's. Take over. Captain, the power's gone. Propulsion to neutral. Propulsion to neutral. Switch to batteries. Switch to batteries. Pshenichny... tell Belikov he's got to get in there and wind down those rods. We've only got four bottles of oxygen left. That'll be enough. Just get him and somebody who isn't going to breathe a lot into that chamber. You mean one of the kids. Yeah, one of the kids. And hurry. This is a difficult situation. Give it to me straight, Gena. Is this a meltdown? Not yet. What if you're wrong? If I'm wrong, what difference would it make? We can still dive to the bottom, let the meltdown happen there. It would save a lot of lives. We've still got a chance. You're wanted, Preminin. If you do this right, you'll get a medal. Come on. Come on. Who's coming with me? Preminin here. Good man. You done this before? No. No problem. Just follow me. How many bottles of oxygen have we got? Four. She's down by the head. Planes at 1-8-0 degrees. Looks like she's losing power. Captain? I hear you, Sonar. I'm picking up an alarm. Can you ID, Sonar? It sounds like a reactor malfunction. I'm relaying it now. X.O., back us off, full power stern. Aye. Evans, reverse the screw full power stern. Sir. Get a message to command, Jack, top priority. We've got a serious situation here. Aye, skipper. We'll see you later. Good luck. They're in. Who's with him? Preminin. Right. Jesus, Larry, we're looking at a meltdown. The winds are onshore. They're freshening to 20 knots. If those reactors go, it's gonna make Chernobyl look like a backyard barbecue. I understand that. The President has to at least alert the governors of the New England states. The White House doesn't want the news to get out. They're afraid they're going to have the eastern seaboard stampeding for safety, which is going to cause a lot more damage than some hypothetical meltdown. That is not what this is about, and you know it! If it gets out that a collision between a Soviet and an American sub has endangered the whole eastern seaboard, the summit is dead and the peace process with it. We got a unique opportunity here... Don't give me that perestroika shit! The President called it right the first time - an evil empire. We couldn't trust them before, and we can't trust them now. And we can't trust one of their subs sitting off our coast with 32 warheads and its hatches open. If the politicians weren't running things, we would've sunk it an hour ago! That's exactly why the politicians are running things. Larry, look. If those reactors melt down and dump a radioactive cloud on Boston, that's gonna damn sure kill your peace process and several million Americans along with it. This order is direct from the White House. The matter is top secret. No one is to know. Temperature in the reactor chamber? Shit. Is it stabilizing? It's getting hotter. Pumps, build up the pressure in eight. We're going to have a problem getting those guys out of there unless we keep the pressure between the two compartments equal. Let's just get the rods down first. Get the cutters. Remote from Moscow, sir. They want a report on the status of the reactors. Did you report it? No, sir. They said the Americans were under the impression that we have a problem. What shall I tell them? Tell them the truth. That's all we have. Yes, sir. OK, Sergei, just watch what I do. We've got four rods - two for each reactor. We have to get them all down. Gena, what's goin' on? Captain, the first rod is down. Captain, the first reactor is shut down. Shall I take over? No, it's OK. I'm all right. Ow! I'm out of air. You'll have to take over. Belikov! Open the hatch! Come on! He's used up all his oxygen! Come on! Get him out! Someone take his legs! We've got him! Captain, this is Pshenichny. Belikov has passed out. But both men are with us, and the reactor room is sealed. There's still one to go. Captain, the fourth rod's not down yet. He wants to speak to you. Sergei, this is the captain. Can you get back in? Uh, yes, sir. You've got the last available air. Don't take too long. No problem, sir. You've got one bottle of oxygen left. That's all. What's it like in there? It's hot. Hey... Come on, boys. All right, come on. Grab on to the hatch. Come on now. Together. Push. Come on, push. Remember, you've only got ten minutes. That's it. Grenady, increase the pressure in here, or we're not gonna be able to get that door open. I'm aware of that, Comrade Pshenichny. Control, tell him he's running out of time. It's dropping. Yeah. It's dropping. Come on. Come on! Captain, this is Preminin. The last rod is down. Good job, Sergei! Get the hell out of there. Pshenichny, release the hatch. Tell the ships they can come in now. Yes, sir. Tell Moscow the reactors are shut down. Yes! The pressure is rising in the reactor room because of the heat. We need to raise the pressure at eight to make the two compartments equal. This is the captain to compartment eight. Whoever's without life support, move them to compartment nine. Pshenichny, I need to equalize the pressure. And get the ram ready, just in case I need it. Come on. Get going back to nine. I'm staying. No, back to nine! I'm staying! Go. Everyone is in nine except the working party, and their compartment is sealed off. Got you. Pumps, bring the pressure up in eight as fast as you can. I'm bringing up the pressure now. Masks on! We've got gas coming through the vents. Make it fast. The ram's in place, Captain. Tell us when to start. Sergei? This is the captain. I know you can hear me. I am at the hatch. There's a valve above your head. Can you see it? Yes. Turn it to the left. It will vent the compartment to air. Release the pressure. You get me? I can't reach it. That's all right. We'll use the ram. Pshenichny, start using the ram. Yes, Captain. Get going, men. Sergei, if it's hard for you to speak, just tap the microphone. Good lad. Come on! Captain, this is Pshenichny. The pressure is so high in there, it's like pushing against a brick wall. Sergei, when I tell you to get to the hatch, you have to move fast. I know you're low on oxygen, but you can do it. Sergei? Do you hear me? Just hold on a few more seconds. You have done such a good job. You saved the boat. You saved all of us. As far as I'm concerned, you saved the entire East Coast of the United States. That's quite an achievement for someone who's, what, 20? That'll be something to remember when you get home. And we'll all be home in a couple of days. So you've got to make this last effort. Now tap the mic so I know you understand. Sergei? Sergei? Tap. Pressure's rising in eight. If we're not careful, we're going to have the same problem as we did in seven. OK, Sergei, make your move now. Get over to the hatch. When you feel it move, you've got to help. You've got to pull. Come on. Seryozha. The pressure's rising fast. We could lose them all. Clear the hatch. We're nearly there! Close it. There are six men in eight. One life for six. Yes. Captain, this is Aznabaev. We're taking on too much water. The Krasny-Omirsky is now alongside. Captain to the crew. Abandon ship. Are you coming with us? I'll be right up. Fire's out. Reactor's been shut down. Thank God. Well, Larry, looks like the President's gonna get his summit after all. Hope he doesn't give away the store. Tell operations to stand down. Aye, sir. Gentlemen, thank you. Get some sleep, eh? You, too. Thanks. You lucked out this time, Mr. Brock, and you know it. Next time, I hope we sink the son of a bitch. Captain! She's goin' down. This is the captain. Boomer is going down. Stand by for secondary detonation. I say again, stand by for secondary detonation. 1,000 feet. 2,000 feet. 3,000 feet. 5,000 feet and still accelerating, sir. Speed 50 knots. Stand by for the big one, gentlemen. Sonar? Still nothing, sir. Jack, take a message for command, please. Boomer sank at 22:30 hours. Depth, Sonar? 18,000 feet, sir. Crew evacuated with no apparent casualties. There was no secondary detonation from ship's reactor or onboard missiles. Request air and sea recon... ...to monitor radiation. We are standing by. Not celebrating, Lieutenant? No. No, sir, I'm not. Thinking about those men? Actually, I'm thinking about the over 200 megatons of radioactive material that's been dropped in the Atlantic. Well, given the alternative, I'd say we have a great deal to be thankful for. He must be a remarkable man. The captain? Mm-hmm. Mmm. I'm not sure the Kremlin would agree. Where's Pshenichny? I think he's talking to headquarters. So how are things in Moscow? Well, I spoke to the admiral. He argued your case. But there was nothing he could do. He wants me to take possession of the logbook, codebooks, and the nuclear keys. All right. The key, Captain. Captain, your men are asking for you. Captain. I'll need your party card. Company, attention! Officers and crew of the K219 all present and correct, sir. Officers and men of K219, we are overjoyed at your safe return. You will spend a few days at the recreation camp near here where you will be debriefed. Then you will go home to your families. Your courage in the past few days has been in the highest tradition of the Soviet Navy. It is my privilege to honor some of you on the recommendation of your captain. Preminin, Sergei Sergeivich. Preminin, Sergei Sergeivich. Still on patrol, sir. Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev met as planned in Reykjavik, Iceland. President Reagan expressed his condolences on the loss of life aboard the K219, although the United States government denied any involvement in the sinking of the submarine. Upon their return to the Soviet Union, the crew of the K219 was broken up and assigned to different ships in the North Atlantic. Captain Britanov was dismissed from the Soviet Navy. Ripped by: SkyFury
