In a police inquiry, when the killer is also the victim, and the superintendent and killer are the same man, the victim often becomes the superintendent's killer, victim of the pseudo-victim, and that doesn't simplify matters. It's best when the killer is the killer. An inquiry by Superintendent Pichard and Inspector Charbonnier THE TOILET WAS LOCKED FROM THE INSIDE Chief. Hello, Superintendent. It's here, chief. He isn't a pretty sight. No. What happened? The concierge called. He heard an explosion, so he came up to see. He found the door locked. He broke it down. He found no one in here. The extraordinary thing is, the toilet was locked from the inside. Gaspard Gazul, an RATP employee, died in his loo, alone like a dog. Yes. That isn't much to go on. It's unbelievable. The bloke locked himself in his own loo. A loner, basically. And bam, rubbed out! - Disturbing, huh? - It certainly is. Why of course, that's it! The loo was booby-trapped. - It's unlikely. - Why? Think for a second. The bowl and tank are intact, as are the walls, apart from some blood. Everything's intact. The explosion occurred on him. I'd even say in him. Ah, yes! That's the problem with locked-room cases. That's our lot, my dear Charbo, just like the rest. Remember The Mystery of the Yellow Room. Yes. Except this is The Mystery of the Green WC! There's no way you can get in when it's locked from the inside. There's only the one door. There's this air vent here, but it's too small. No one can get through it. Maybe a monkey could. - But a tiny monkey. - Come see. Oh, a tiny monkey! Rene! Yes, chief? Come up here. Right away, chief. What is it, sir? Come here, my dear Rene. See that musician? You're to tail him. Company, haunts, home, itinerary, the whole shebang. Consider it done, chief. Chief, why did you make me come up 3 flights? You could've shouted at me from the window. Listen, Rene, stop... OK? OK. All right. I think we're done here. He had mail. I didn't hear anything. I barely knew him. "J. O. 52 Rue Gabriel-Peri." Ha-ha, I got you this time! I get the feeling, Charbo, we're going to visit 52 Rue Gabriel-Peri. I was about to suggest that. It's working, chief. He doesn't suspect a thing. Officer Rene is hard work. In the police, pal, everything's hard work. - Yes? - Hello, madam. Police. Do you have a tenant whose initials are J.O.? No, an owner. Second floor. Some atmosphere! She wasn't very cooperative. Cooperation doesn't exist, mate. In the police, you can only count on yourself. It isn't that bad. I mean, seriously! I'm not taking any hassle. She's a Parisian. I'll give her a good slap. - We're serving our country. - Sure. "Odette Jeandrin." O. J., J. O. She switched it to put us off the scent. Gentlemen? Hello... Hello, madam. - Mrs Odette Jeandrin? - Yes. Why? Sorry to bother you... You're not. What can I do for you? Did you write this letter? No. Why? But your name's Odette Jeandrin? Yes. Why? Do you recognize your handwriting? No, not at all. Why? Why? No, it's... Who's asking the questions? You or me? - You are. Why? - Yes. Right. - You don't recognize it? - No. OK. Well, remain available for further questioning. - Thank you. - Yes. Why? Why? "Joseph Orangutan." J. O. This is it, chief. Come in. The door's open. Is that you, Marcel? I'm in here. I won't be a minute. I'll be with you in a jiffy. Police. Don't be so familiar. Joseph Orangutan, is that you? - I thought you were a pal. - Well, I'm not. Hey, my dear Charbo, look. Well, well, well. What a coincidence. Tell me, Joseph Orangutan, does this ring any bells? And this? "Ha-ha, I got you this time!" You wrote it, eh, Orangutan? You wrote this and this, eh? I suppose these are anti-tuberculosis stamps! What is this? Are you going to talk, Orangutan? - Don't you insult me. - Why shouldn't I? Come on, Charbo, calm down. Mr Orangutan, let's be friends, OK? We'd like to know where you were at 9am. 9am? I was with Marcel Boulanger in Aubervilliers. I bought that nag there. It's a beautiful nag, but these old things don't... We don't give a damn! Where were you this morning? I already told you! In Aubervilliers. You can check. 29 people saw me. We'll check that out. And does this ring a bell? Hey! Relax. Calm down. Mr Orangutan, what do you know about this? That's it. It's simple. Gaspard and me do target practice. The winner is the first to get five bullets in the red circle. I was at the funfair 2 days ago. I did that card there and sent it to him. But how come you have it? Did Gaspard give it to you? Gaspard? Don't make me laugh! - Gaspard has been murdered. - What? That's right, Mr Orangutan. Your friend Gaspard Gazul was found murdered at 9am this morning in his flat. Gaspard... dead. My dear Gaspard... 25 years we were friends. 3 years in the navy together. We were handsome then. The three of us united like the fingers of a hand. Me, Gaspard and Pascal. Pascal? Tell us about this 3rd finger. Piazzorossicelli. We've lost touch. He moved to Marseille. He owns something like... a cafe, bar or restaurant. The Tchi-Tchi, I think. - The what? - The Tchi-Tchi. The Tchi-Tchi. - Fancy a trip to Marseille? - I was about to suggest it. Well, goodbye then, sir. Sorry for breaking the bad news. We have a tough job. Remain available for questioning. I doubt we'll need you though. - Goodbye, Mr Ape. - Orangutan! You again? Hello again. Just to say you've been cleared, and you're not required to remain available. - Pity, that. Charbo, please. God, you're so serious! Maybe so, miss. But we're on duty, and in our job, there's nothing like male friendship when it serves justice. I'm sure you understand. And now, Marseille. This is it, chief. Let's go. Does Piazzorossicelli own this place? 1st floor, 2nd door on the left. PRIVATE Come in. - She isn't our man. - Never fear, kid. Sit down, gents. I'll be with you in a tick. Thank you kindly. Sorry to disturb your ablutions. Go on. I hope we didn't get the wrong door. We were looking for Mr Piazzorossicelli, and we were sent here. You got the right door, gents. I'm his wife. My husband can't see anyone. Has he been taken ill? We could postpone the interview. When can we come back? In 3 years' time. In 3 years' time? That really doesn't suit us. The inquiry can't drag on forever. Can we reach him? Madam, where's your husband? - In Les Baumettes Prison. - Les Baumettes? Damn! In that case, sorry for bothering you. We'll leave you then. - No. - Ah, sorry. Where do you think we're going now? Les Baumettes? Bravo! Carry on like that, you'll go far. Take us to Les Baumettes. - Pascal Piazzorossicelli. - 2nd floor. Cell 17. - May we see him? - Yes. Follow me. Pascal Piazzorossicelli? That's right. How may I help you? - Do you know Joseph Orangutan? - I certainly do. 3 years together in the navy. And Gaspard Gazul? Gazul, Orangutan and I were quite a team. Why? What's Gaspard done? What's he done? Not much. He's been murdered. Murdered? Gaspard? Who could've done that? Speak to Barbocelli. He was a friend of ours. He lived in Rue du Panier. - Do you have a cigarette? - Shut up! No, my dear Charbo, no. A cigarette given wisely can be worth more than a clue. That's it. Excuse me, would you happen to know a Mr Barbocelli? He moved years ago. He's at 213 Chemin de Morgiou. Charbo. I think we're on the right track. This is it, chief. - Barbocelli? - Ground floor, 1st right. Here you go. - Barbocelli? - That's me. Why? Why didn't you say so earlier? You didn't ask me. Dominique! Why are you here? Pascal, damn! That's a good one. We don't have all night! Got anything to tell us? Yes. You should try young Gwendoline Kernadet. She worked at Pascal's a while back. She's moved home to Carnac. She knew Gaspard Gazul well. If I were you, I'd go to Carnac. We don't need you to tell us where to go. - Where did you say? - Carnac. - Miss Kernadet? - That's me. - Do you live in Carnac? - Yes. - Why are you in Etretat? - I'm on business. - On business? - Yes. She's on business. Don't make our job harder! Given your situation, it's a bad idea! What do you mean? Superintendent Pichard. Superintendent, Inspector... You're not the police, are you? Oh, my God! We have a few questions, concerning Gaspard Gazul. You knew him. Tell us whatever you know. He was found murdered in his flat yesterday at 7am local time. Speak, you prostitute! No, no, no! I promised to keep quiet. - Talk! - Please, Inspector. - Talk! - Oh, no, no, no! Talk, or I'll take your permit. All right. I'll tell you everything. I'm an unhappy wretch. I met Gaspard Gazul 10 years ago. He was always so kind to me. He was a friend. I was like his adoptive daughter. I didn't do anything! No! I loved him. And I sold myself to pay for his car. - I'm taking notes. - I don't understand! I swear... I swear I didn't kill him. Stand up, my child. Thank you for your kindness and your clarifications. Remain available for further questioning. Well, Charbo, what do you think? To be honest, with the storm, I didn't catch anything. Me neither. Actually, one word. Really? You lucky so-and-so. Which word did you hear? Sorry? Hatbox. You're underestimating yourself. That's two words. It's one word. Hatbox. Hatbox. Oh, chief... The train is about to leave. Excuse me, are these seats free? Yes. Chief. It's weird how much sexy stuff there is in this case. Every 5 minutes, we see a naked lady. Correct, Charbo. Hatbox... Will the hatbox reveal its secrets? Chief, I'm scared. Me too, Charbo. But we have to go on. That's better. Right, let's try to find that hatbox. It isn't going to be easy. You go that way. I'll go this way. There. Cold. Cold. Hot. That's the North Pole! It's impossible to find anything here. You'd need an amazing sense of smell. You take me for a police dog? - Chief, you're amazing. - Thanks for the compliment. Hang on. Let's see. I'll take care of this. Chief, I've got all the info about the hat. It belonged to the victim. And? The fact is, it hardly moves the case forward. For sure. You didn't notice this. It's like in the masked-boxer case. That was some case. There was a... A thing that... Huh? Noticed anything else about this trinket? Yes. There's a... One's missing. It's a pair for a one-legged man. Why do you always go on first impressions? Observe. Don't jump to conclusions. It isn't a one-legged man? Give me a break! What does it say? There? "Daumesnil Ring." Hey, that rings a bell. Could it be a boxing club somewhere in Daumesnil? I'd only be half-surprised. Something tells me we're going to pay a visit. To Daumesnil? You guessed right, Charbo. Hats off! Tyrolean? Ah, no! Not that, damn it! I've had enough! I was just having a laugh. Is Gazul's killer among the Daumesnil Ring's boxers? This is it, chief. Chief, a one-legged man. I told you so. I'll take care of this. I caught the one-legged man. Pretty easily, too. I can give you a detailed report. I took notes. The man's innocent. He has nothing to do with our case. Are you two done? Come in and be quiet or chat somewhere else, OK? That's something else! What is it this time? We'd like to have a look around your stadium. - Hey! Do you have a warrant? - Do we look like we do? Carry on, lads. - Excuse me. - Hang on. Gaspard Gazul, know him? Let me see. Gaspard Gazul... Yes. He's the bus conductor. I met him because I took his bus every day. We even became pals. I convinced him to come here. Question these gents. They all know him. Go that way. I'll join you. This ring any bells? That photo? Yes, sure. It's Gaspard Gazul. It's Gaspard Gazul. Why? Do you know this man? Do you know this man? I certainly do, sir. It's Gaspard Gazul. Watch it, you! Gaspard. Gaspard who? Gaspard Gazul. Did you find anything out? Not really, but they all know him. Yes. They all know him. Amazing! Spoken to him? No. Me neither. Let's go check. - Can we ask you something? - Yes, or course. What's the question? Do you know this man? No, I've never seen him before. Does the name Gaspard Gazul mean anything to you? Nothing. Gaspard Gazul trains here. Everyone knows him. But you don't. It's perfectly logical! You're off to a bad start. I've only been coming here a week. I don't know everyone. It's odd he's the only one not to know Gazul. - Did you see his pendant? - I did, son, I did. It's the same as on the Tyrolean hat. Yes, I saw. It's a mystery. If he has the other glove, they must have met at least once. - Wouldn't you say? - I would, son. What time are we going to get to eat? There's movement. I don't see our man. Let's hope he didn't leave by an emergency exit. Here he is. Follow him discreetly. I'm parked the wrong way. In detective films, the cars always start and they're parked the right way. This shit only happens to me! I'm bloody sick of it. Where's he going? - What are they up to? - He's got class. What now, chief? We pretend to look for a number. But they'll see us! - Don't worry about that. - What number? We're looking for 32. They're coming towards us. Damn! Look at the street numbers. Focus on something, look for the way. Get down! They're coming this way. I said we were in the way. OK, turn around. Any idea where we are? Here, Charbo, 20km west of Paris. The road is like a never-ending ribbon. Who is that guy? He's like Dracula. They're parting. What now, chief? You stay here and watch the manor. - And the bloke in the car? - Leave him to me. - Give me the car keys. - OK. Chief, that's the door and this is the ignition. - Be careful with the clutch. - Will do. And don't slam on the brakes. - All right. - Hey! Hold the gearstick. The third gear jumps. Thank you. Chief, chief! You'd best add some oil, the car guzzles it. Listen, mate... damn it! OK, but who gets grief afterwards? Psychiatric Clinic Take the sock of the one-legged man in 57. Is that it? Anything else? No, that's everything. Is that all the laundry? Yes, Gramps. That's it for today. Damn. I think that will do. - Take him back. - OK, doctor. Gazul. Charbonnier is still keeping watch More sexy stuff! The man in black... Calm down. Why are you here? Are you here? For God's sake, remember! You're dead, you exploded in your toilet. This is bloody insane. Dead? Me? Oh, my head, my poor head! - The man in black! - Don't shout. The man in black! The man in black... The man in black is there. - What's wrong? - The man in black... Yes, sure, the man in black! The man in black, the man in black... No one ever believes me. The man in black! Calm down, calm down. Lift him up. Hello? Ah, it's you. What's going on? She wants to tonight? Can't we postpone it? Hang on. Take him back. OK, I'll come now. That's right. Goodbye. Hey, you there! Run after him! Run! Catch him, goddamn it! I want him alive, all right? Are you done acting? Leave me alone. My head, my poor head... We'll deal with that later. Why are you here? What can I say? I've been here 15 years. What? 3 weeks ago you were a bus conductor. Ah no, no, that's Gaspard. He's my brother. We're twins. I'd have liked to work on a bus too. He succeeded but I... - Tell me about him. - Twin brother, twin brother... Leave me alone. My poor head... I know who you are. - No, I'm not the man in black. - I know you're not. You're Camember the Sapper. Sapper Camember. Sapper Camember. Sapper Camember is here! I've never led such a dumb case. You? Me. - Where were you? - In an asylum. - I don't believe you. - It's the truth. Ah? Joking aside, did you find anything out? I actually saw Gaspard Gazul. - Gazul? The late Gazul? - No. He's alive. He isn't dead? Yes. He's dead. Really? You just said he was alive. Sometimes, Charbo, you can be dead and alive. - Oh? - That's right, pal. It's funny but I'm totally lost. Have you seen anything suspicious? No, nothing special. I'll tell you, I took notes. A guy released a carrier pigeon, two naked girls were waltzing, a guy tumbled from the roof and a minion disappeared into a bush. Just routine stuff. Yes, all perfectly normal. - One interesting thing... - May I know? The one-legged man, chief, he reappeared. He was refereeing a fight there. - Incredible. - You can say that again. Right, well... let's not hang around. I'm hungry. These mosque blokes aren't very Catholic. - Let's pay them a visit. - Ah? OK. - Chief, grab me. - Come on. - Hurry! - Pull me up. That's what I'm doing. Make an effort. - Ouch! Come on, Charbo. - My foot's stuck. Come on, Charbo! - My foot's stuck in it. - Keep going. Hello, Mother. You're here at last. I hear you want to again tonight? Oh, yes. - Angelo didn't want to. - Do as you please. Don't be angry with him. He's so young. Indeed. From now on, I shall ask you. Do you mind? Let's satisfy your whims. God knows where this'll end. Hello? Good evening, Joseph. Ah. But I won't be there. Yes. I understand. We'll do as we usually do. That's right. Goodbye. Thank you, Joseph. It's all arranged. May I? BUS FULL - Is everything ready? - Yes, sir. Come along. - Coming, Angelo? - No. No, I feel a bit tired. And I don't think my presence is indispensable. Neither do I. Where are they going? If only I knew. As we lot say, "We'll have to see." You lot are a brave bunch. Damn, they're clearing off. They're slinging their hook. What now? We tail them. Hey... Er... Charbo. Charbo! - Yes? - Jump! Yes. OK. I'm coming. Ouch. Ouch! - Get a move on! - I fell flat on my face. Just look at them. Bunch of loonies! Let's see. It's one of two things. They're either mad or barmy. What derision. I'd take them down to the nick. - On what grounds? - Hey, come on! If you need proof to arrest loonies, what's the world coming to? For the police, there are only culprits. We can't spend all night watching them. This roundabout knows more than it's willing to say. We'll come back in the morning. I've had an idea, chief. How about we come back in the morning? - I was about to suggest that. - Maybe it's a dumb idea. What evil genius is behind the evil roundabout? Are you the owner? You could answer. You're not very chatty. We're the police after all. Right, listen, friend. Our inquiry has been long and hard. It has led us to you, so tell us what you know about Gaspard Gazul. Speak, you swine! The big pig guy. Orangutan... One, I already told you not to insult me. Two, I've told you what I know about Gazul. So if you'll excuse me, I've got work to do. I get the feeling we're going round in circles. Dramatic Turn of Events: Orangutan Innocent! Charbo, get a move on! What's the matter? - I'm not sure I'm worthy. - What? That's right. After such a failure, this station, this temple, where complex mysteries have been solved, and me, the failure, no-hoper... How can I set foot in there again? No. It's over for me. So long, then. Hello, The Albatross? Raoul, hi. Bring us up two beers and two ham sandwiches. And hurry, we've not eaten for 72 hours. Yes, I'll tell you all about it. Two beers, two ham sandwiches. Superintendent. Hello, Mr Charbo. Hello, mate. Right... let's sum up. One, the bloke died in his toilet. Two, the toilet was locked from the inside. And three... There's no three. Shit! I'm sick of this! Right, let's start again. He goes into his toilet. He comes in... He bolts the door. Not eating, chief? I'm going to the RATP. RECRUITMENT We're not hiring! Wait for positions to become available. A Byrrh and a telephone, please. Thank you. Hello, Charbo? Get the RATP's jobless to come in this afternoon. Yes. That's right. Goodbye. - Hello, gentlemen. - Hello. Thank you. You're most kind. - Are they here? - Yes. Everyone's here. My dear Lucien, go ahead. Let's go. Oh, Gazul! Chief, tell him to stop, I feel seasick. Gazul... I'm arresting you for murder. Are you sure? Maybe it's a miscarriage of justice. Listen, mate... damn it! Right. Even so, chief, it's terrible. Maybe, my dear Charbo, but we've taken care of it. GAZUL MYSTERY CLEARED UP! PICHARD SHEDS LIGHT ON WC! KILLER ARRESTED! PICTURES OF THE KILLER! My dear Charbo, I'm honoured to present Gazul. - Gazul? The dead man? - No, his twin brother. Gaspard Gazul's twin brother. That's right, isn't it? Yes, that's right. So you were released from the clinic? What clinic? Ah no, you mean Balthazar, who's still in the clinic. In fact, we're three brothers. Gaspard... Peace to his ashes. Balthazar, and then there's... me who's talking to you... Melchior. The Gazul brothers. Gaspard, Melchior and Balthazar. Three twin brothers. Triplets, as it were. Triplets. You put us off the scent, huh? Back to the crime. You're going to tell us why now. Gaspard... Gaspard... You wouldn't understand. He was the best at everything. So Balthazar and I tried to be as good as him, but it was impossible. One fine day Balthazar... went and lost his mind. He had to be committed. And then me, me, me... Well, I... I couldn't bear him being successful. I decided to eliminate him because I figured that'd free up a place for me, and I'd have a chance. But now... my goose is cooked. Chief, how did you know? Elementary, my dear boy. - Remember that noise in the hangar? - The squeaking? Oh, yes. Sir, be kind enough to stand up and start swaying. Can't you tell him to stop? It's making me roll. Stop. Are you OK, Charbo? Could you please stop swaying? I feel queasy. My parents could never take me on boats. Fernand, please lift up the gentleman's trouser leg. Oh, damn! - A zinc leg. - Correct. And now, look... Get lost, Fernand. Try to follow. Melchior knew his brother's habits, and that he was a heavy sleeper. So one day... sneaking into his place, replacing his ticket puncher with another puncher that was booby-trapped... was child's play. All he had to do then, my dear Charbo, was to quit the premises. It was at that precise moment that he lost... he lost the fateful nut. The next day, Gaspard Gazul got up as usual, washed, ate and dressed then adjusted around his waist his ticket puncher. He was ready to go to work. At that very moment, following a well-established habit, he performed a daily ritual. He went to have a pee. And as strange as it may seem, probably as the result of a very strict upbringing, he bolted the door. And what do you think happened? Remember how the witnesses described him. It all fits. It's obvious, my dear Charbo. A professional tic. I'm surprised you didn't think of disposing of his body and replacing him on his bus the following day. After all, you're his double. Damn. You're right. I can be so dumb. Yes, you certainly can. - Well, that's what I think. - That's what we think. Fernand, please take him away. Chief, what a man you are. You'll see, he'll get out of it thanks to his leg. I was right, though. It was a one-legged man. I knew that, son. We just had to work out which. The case has taken off again. Come on, you! Get in there. Go on, you scumbag. Following your instructions, I tailed the prime suspect. Here's my report. "Today, the 31st of May, "the Superintendent told me to tail the suspect, "who claims to be an organ grinder. "In a discreet manner, despite the bustle, "I positioned myself 8.40m from the presumed suspect." - Make it quick. - Yes, because... Don't you want me to...? Get to the point. OK. Here's my conclusion. It's categorical. He has nothing to do with the case. Get out of here, you! And stay out of trouble. Mission accomplished. Anyone else to tail? Do as you please, Rene. Very well. Chief. Yes? You can't imagine how fond I am of you. Rene has got to be the dumbest bloke ever. You're right, Charbo. But it's thanks to humble servants of the law, lowly officers like him, that our citizens can live happily and in peace. Thank you. You'll be chief one day. You'll have a junior by your side one day. You'll have to unravel evil and criminal plots one day. One day... you'll live intensely. Come on, Charbonnier. "After so many others, we can but repeat "that it is no longer possible "to base a detective story's plot "on the principle of twin brothers." "That's why we chose triplets."
