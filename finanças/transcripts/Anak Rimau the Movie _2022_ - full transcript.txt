Haziq. Ball. Haziq. -Haziq, Haziq, Haziq. Why are you playing like that? -Hei, Yazid. Hi. My name is Tuck. The one that just fell, thats me. Why did you do that? -Yazid, enough, cool down. And those guys are my team mates. Always picking a fight. Stop! Meal break! Meal break! -Let's go back for dinner! My team comes from all over Malaysia. Some come from the rural side,... ...and some from the city. -That's Wak. Let's all follow him! -Where are you guys heading to? Some are well to do and some are not. But, whats certain,... ...all of us are really passionate about football. And this is where it all began. Badrul! Be careful, Badrul! Gosh, all you think about is football. Go! Further! Thats awesome Ariff! Ariff! Ariff! That's my boy. Goal! Goal! Pay up. Big money. Just listen to me, Ril! -Why do I have to listen to you? I'm in charge of the finances. -But who's the coach? Me or you? Yes, of course, but you're on a losing streak. So, what now? If you think what you are doing is right,... ...then do it yourself! -Ril. Ril. I don't care anymore! -Hey, Ril. Hear me out. Nothing but bullshit! Starting from today, you take over Anak Rimau. What about Coach Ril? -Can you? Sure. Morning Coach Zainal. -Morning. Our land of birth Anak Rimau Football Academy Sorry I'm late. It's Ariff. Thank you. Apologies. Peace be upon you and greetings everyone. Welcome to Anak Rimau Academy. My name is Coach Zainal,... ...and this is Coach Khalid and Coach Ramzan,... ...who will be helping out in the training of this team, okay? Look behind you. Do you see whats written there? "A tiger's legacy is it's stripes, a man's legacy is his name." Over here, I'm leaving my cow behind. That is the motto that you all have to stand by... ...and remember throughout the duration that you are here. You are the best and you are the selected. And today, you have accepted... ...the responsibility and trust to fight on as a team. And as a team, you must always remember... ...your main objectives and who you are. I am Kaka. I'm a native. I am Yazid. -I am Badrul. -I am Wak. I am Hamid. Starting from today you are no longer... ...Yazid and you are no longer Wak. Oh, no! My mom's going to cry. Starting from today, all of you are Anak Rimau. Who are we? -Anak Rimau. Okay. Pick up your bags and go home. What's going on coach? I want to play football. Yeah coach, it isn't funny. -What's going on coach? I don't want to go back. Who are we? -Anak Rimau. Who are we? -Anak Rimau! I don't believe that you all really want to be here. Who are we? -Anak Rimau! Get out. Thank God. Here you go. As promised. Thank you very much. Drive safely. It's okay. Please, please. Go ahead. Luckily, I noticed. Now that we have arrived,... ...so do you confirm that you want to go on with it? So, from now on, you have to be committed... ...to what you've said. There's no turning back. Lets go. Now listen, you have to be really confident to represent your family. So, whatever you do here, don't embarrass your parents. You understand? Lets go. One more thing. Right from this moment, you need to decide what you want be. Who is calling now? Its your father. Hello, peace be upon you. We have arrived. What about you? I want to ask you something. When you went into the boat just now,... ...did you step in with your right foot or left foot? Hurry up, Pak Arab. -Hang on, it's your father. Send my regards to him. Okay, Okay. Let's go, Let's go. Enough. Definitely. San, you just settle the problem you have with your boat. I'll keep an eye on Maro. Don't worry. I'll take care of Maro like my own flesh and blood. You, make sure you help take care of his mother for me. Peace be upon you too. -Pak Arab. Your father. Oh, Pak Arab. I'm so happy to be here. Thank you for the opportunity. No worries, Mr. Wilson. We're more than happy to have you here. We appreciate everything that you've done for us. Oh, yeah, I almost forgot. Consider this the beginning of a great year. An exceptional year. How's your coach? -Oh, Zainal? He's good. Young, enthusiastic. And the most important thing,... ...he's on our side. -That's right. And do make sure we're on the same side. Yes, definitely. Thank you. I'll sleep there. -Then I'll sleep over here. Such a monkey. Wow. Haziq, it's only been one day but I miss Sarok so much. Enough with Sarok, Satesh. You're just too much. My body is here. But, my heart is still at home. You give me the creeps, Satesh. Hurry up. I'm sorry. What's wrong with you? Are you blind? Sorry, Yazid. -Clean this up! Hey, what are you both fighting about? It's nothing, Abang Man. He bumped into me. So, what's this? You guys want to dine on the floor? Enough, go get a new tray and eat. Sorry, Yazid. Apologies, Abang Mat. Sorry. -It's okay. Go and eat. Rahim. Where's Rahim? -Here. If training starts at 7:00,... ...what time do you all have to be at the field? 7:00 sharp Coach. 7:00 sharp? 6:50 you must be on the field,... ...no questions, run 10 rounds straight away If you arrive at 7:00, you will be benched,... ...just watch others train and then pick up the balls, understand? Yes, we do. Maro! Good, Maro. Good job, good job. -Well done, Maro. Danish, don't laugh. Good job, good job. Come on, come on! Zainal! Good job, good job. -Khalid, give me a moment. My son has real potential. Hello. Of course. From our past experiences, we know how to determine our star player... ...and Danish really, really stands out. I'm sure Coach Zainal agrees, right? Jadi, apa pendapat Coach tentang anak saya? All the boys with us are talented. Otherwise, they won't be here. In my opinion, all of them have great potential. Everybody has potential. Yeah, you're right. But not everybody can be a star. You're right. Zainal, Mr. Wilson here is our biggest sponsor this year. But why polish only one of them... ...when we can train all of them to become stars. He's new, so he's very enthusiastic. Yeah, I can see that. Not long after we began out training,... ...we were informed that we will be participating... ...in the ASEAN Youth Football Cup Tournament. But, at that moment, I was convinced... ...that we were far from being ready. For your first game today, I want you all to play as a team. Even though this team was just formed,... ...but now, is the best and most suitable time... ...for you all to get to know each other. And as a team, we need a captain. Me, Coach! I want to captain this team. Lead your teammates properly on the field. All right, coach. Who are we? -Anak Rimau. I can't hear you. Come on, guys. Who are we? -Anak Rimau! Lionspura. Anak Rimau! Anak Rimau! Why are you playing solo? Pass the ball! What's going on referee? Come on. Whats wrong with you? Pass the ball Why keep the ball to yourself? What's wrong with you? Play properly! Pass the ball, Ariff. -Here. Yazid. Pass the ball, Haziq. Yazid. Why did you do that? Yazid! Yazid! You guys tackling ball or feet? You get lost! Yazid! Nombor 9. All of you come here. Tuck , are you okay? Okay, coach. I can play on. Are you sure you can play? Can you get up? Don't get up yet. -Kaka. Where is Kaka? Stand by. They played rough. Such a bummer. Listen. Listen up! What are you all doing on the field? Look at you guys. Some are hogging the ball. Some are dribbling solo. You all have team mates on the field, right? Play as a team. What's wrong with you guys? It was you, Izzat. Why did you hog the ball? You, shut up! Don't you dare talk about me! What about you? Izzat. This is everyone's fault. Why are you keeping the ball to yourself for too long? The rest of you, if your team mate... ...receives the ball, why are you standing behind your marker? Make an open play and find opportunities. Understand? Enter the field. -Let's go, let's go, let's go! Don't let them possess the ball for too long! Don't dribble, pass it! Come on, 2 - 0. Really? Push up, push up. I spent millions of dollars for this club. This is how they play? Why does everyone depend on me? You think you are the best? -Of course I am! What are you shouting for? You think you're the only one playing? Enough. -Relax, this is a team sport. Haziq, what's wrong with you just now? Why should I be blamed? -Enough! Coach told us, play as a team. Not to hog the ball for yourselves! I agree, Ariff. Isn't the ball round? Are you all listening? We have already lost. Why are we fighting? Tuck, are you okay? -I'm okay, coach. Just now, I saw 11 good players on the field. Each possessing his own individual skill and potential. Good. But,... ...nowhere near good enough! Each of you playing like shit. 11 players playing selfishly. Like shit! None of you working together. Nobody listening to instructions. Playing as a team doesn't just mean playing on the field together,... ...with the same jerseys and being cheered on with the same team name. Playing as a team is when you believe,... ...when you respect and care for one another. That's what it means! Why is this so difficult to understand? I want you all to change the way you play. Now. Not later. But now, do you understand? Understood. You are now appointed the new captain. By wearing this,... ...the trust and the responsibility that you bear is huge, understand? I promise, I'll do my best for the team. Don't make that promise to me, Ariff. Promise all your team mates. Assist Ariff. And now you're standing in the eyes of the world. Only moments away from what can be. There's a passion in the hearts of a few. Ever waiting inside to be set free. What's wrong with you guys? Singing the same song over and over again. Can't you guys sing a different song? And you reach into your soul and live it with all of your might. Coach, how far further? Just keep up. A little further. I can't feel my legs anymore. Tuck, I think you should let coach know about your foot. I'm okay. Mind your own business. Keep quiet. A bit more, come on. I'm okay. -You should let coach know, Tuck. No need. Why? -I'm okay. If I let coach know, I'm sure to be kicked out from the team. Please. Okay, Tuck. Coach, wait up! Danish, where are we heading to? Yeah, it looks as though we're lost. What are we going to do now? You guys are all scaredy-cats, you know? Come on, let's go. Tuck, are you okay? Can you walk? Come on, hurry up. -It's not so bad. Give him a hand. -Is you leg okay? Gosh, Tuck. Are you okay? Oh, Tuck. -Danish! Set him down. So, what now? Oh, boy. I'm so tired. Guys, can you ask coach how long more do we have to walk for? It looks like we have arrived. If it's still far, I'm going to make a U-turn. Congratulations everyone. We have arrived. Thank God. Good thing we have arrived coach. I was just about to turn back. Hang on. Where is Danish's team? Where is Danish's team? -I don't know. Mat, where is Danish's team? Weren't they following you, coach? You were the last in line, Mat. How could you not notice? I don't know Coach. All I know is that I bent down to tie my shoes. And when I got up, everyone had already disappeared. I thought they all followed you, coach. Ariff, Kaka, Nelson. Leave your bags and follow me. Be responsible when looking after the boys, Mat. Hurry up and follow me. The rest of you, help carry... ...Ariff, Kaka and Nelson's bags. The rest of you, follow me. Hurry up! Where did those boys disappear to? Jaz! Izzat! Tuck! -This is all Danishs fault! What a nuisance! Always glued to his phone. Quiet. -He's a troublemaker! Look, you shouting won't do any help. Quit it. Jaz! -Danish! Wak! Izzat! -Jazlan! Hang on. I need to ask you guys. We have already searched quite far. Should we turn back? I think we should. What do you think? -Let's just go back, coach. The rest? Let's head back, coach. No, coach. We must continue searching. We came as a team, so we return as a team. Let's go. Wak! -Jaz! Danish! -Tuck! Tuck, why don't you tell the coach about your leg? Because I love Anak Rimau. If coach knows, I'm sure to be kicked out. Please Haziq, I don't want to go back home. Please? Oh, Tuck. You are exactly like Satesh. But, if you are in this condition, it's not good for the team, right? Wak! -Jaz! Danish! -Tuck! Haziq! Here, over here! We are here! Kaka. Tuck. Danish, this is all your fault! This wouldn't have happened if you weren't glued to your phone! Stop it. Let's help him walk, slowly. Haziq. Nelson. Help him up. -Let's go. Help him with his things. -Slowly. Watch his leg. Be careful. Take it easy. Danish, lets go. Hey, Maro. Where are they? I don't know. I'm worried too. Satesh, would you like to eat? -Coach, where are they? What are you cooking? Fried rice. You all shouldn't worry about them too much. I'm confident that Coach Zainal... ...will bring all of them back by tonight. Don't worry. -All right, don't worry so much. Those who haven't had dinner, eat up. Then clean up, sleep and rest. We'll just wait for their return. -Okay, Abang Mat. Syed, would you like some? It tastes great. Taufiq. -Grab a plate if you want to eat. Coach! Coach! Coach! Coach! Hold on. -What's up with Tuck's leg? Hold on. -Halt! If you really are Coach Zainal,... ...how can you prove tha all of you are living souls? Is that enough? Move it. Yeah, it's really them. Help them. Help them. Be careful. -Where did you all go to? Okay, hold on. While you guys are eating,... ...please listen to what I have to say. Don't get led away by technology, such as mobile phones. You see that? Drifting away. No wonder you get separated. Technology was invented for man to use. For us to control it and not the other way around. No. Remember that. Communication. If you have a problem, share it with your friends. If you're afraid to tell your friends... ...or embarrassed, you can talk to me. If you are hurt or whether you can carry on or not? You hear me, Tuck? Tuck? He's afraid to let you know, coach. We are all afraid too. What are you afraid of? -Danish, have a bite. Because your face is too fierce. I'm not fierce. I just want you all to become the best. Don't pretend to be nice. When I said that Anak Rimau is a team and not an individual,... ...I did not mean that we should not think about our own well-being. If we want others to care for us,... ...we have to learn to care for ourselves first. If we want the team to appreciate us,... ...we have to learn to appreciate ourselves first. Sometimes during a game, we forget... ...which is friend and which is foe. We have to set aside our emotions. Isn't the ball round? So we have to keep the balance. Okay, I got a song. If you really set your mind to something You can surely achieve it But if your heart is filled with doubt You probably won't commit yourself to do it Yes. Yes! What? -Nothing, coach. You're a good player, Haziq. But Coach? -There are no "buts". If you're good, you're good. -I'm afraid, Coach. What are you afraid of? I'm afraid I will disappoint the team. It doesn't mean if you are good,... ...you will never experience being afraid. A great person is... ...when he has the courage to face his fears. Do you understand? -Got it. And I told you from the very beginning. In here you are no longer Haziq, but? Anak Rimau. -Exactly. So you have to have guts, okay? -Okay. Coach. -What? You look different without your moustache, coach. I had been waiting for you to mention about it. You were the one who told me to shave because I looked fearsome. Coach. You can now get a girlfriend, coach. Haziq, first you asked me to get rid of my moustache. And now you ask me to find a girlfriend. Harder! Go, Maro. Yeah! Stop. Just one direction. Faster! Good job! One more! Okay! Okay, that's all for today. Good job! Pak Arab. Maro. How are you? I'm fine thanks. The rest of you don't need to hug me. You all stink. Are all of you fine? -Yes. Sir, visitors are not allowed here. -I'll just be a while sir. If you all want to eat, hurry up. -Okay. Do you think this your own residence? Ariff, how are you? -I'm fine. Come here, I brought some food. Come and join us. It's okay. I have something to do. -Come on, just a bit. It's okay, I have to go. -Come on. It's okay. He must be afraid of that coach just now. It's fine. The rest of you, don't worry. If your coach scolds you, just let me know. I'll do ten push ups. Today I brought something special. You won't get this in your hostel. Spaghetti. Tuck, I heard your foot is injured, right? Is your hand injured? -No. Then start serving, will you? Come let's eat. Pak Arab, may I? -Yes, take this. Give me that ball. Hi, dad. I thought you had training? -Yeah, we just finished. Are you going to go home? -I'm going to Majestic. It's been quite a while since you've ate outside. Just call Grab. I mean with you and mom. Young people, why do you want to spend time with old people? Can I at least come home this weekend? Danish, you have everything you need here at the Academy. Because here you can stay focused. You are the best, no doubt. But now, set your mind as a star. Now look, everybody can play football. But not everybody has what it takes to be a star. You work hard, you are the star. Nothing else matters. Can you see who just scored? Don't brag yet. The game has just started. Just wait and see. That's my boy! Did you see that? You really played well just now. Can you teach me next time? -Sure. I'm going back first. -Me too. Bye. See you later. -See you. Take care. I won. Pay up. I told you not to bet with me. Thank you. Go on, head home. I think you really need to let coach know about your leg. No need to. I don't want to bother, coach. I think I should start packing my things. It's best for me to leave. Why? What can I do here? I can no longer play. Tuck. Are there not 20 players in a team? Not all get the chance to play. -What's your point? I don't want to be a bench warmer. But you can always help us out in other ways. Watch you all play, what then? What else can I do? You're smart. Share your opinion with the others. Help out coach. My opinion? Who wants to listen to what I think? Tuck. If your advice is right and it can help us on the field,... ...I'm sure everyone will accept and follow it. Anyway, just don't worry. Okay? -Okay. Tuck, are you okay? I'm fine, Haziq, thanks. Enough already. You guys know what time it is? We have training tomorrow. So this is the problem. Why did you sleep without closing the door properly? When things go missing tomorrow, then you all start complaining. Eventually, I am to blame. Close it properly. Coach! Mat, where is Ariff's room? Ariff's room. He's over there, room 235. What are you doing here, coach? You're walking in such a hurry. What's going on? Wait outside, Abang Mat. Just wait outside. This is it? God, close the door, Ariff. You always come back late. You know we have training tomorrow. Ariff. You're not done yet with pumping the balls? Not yet and there are a lot more to go. So many more. -Yeah, definitely. Ariff. When is coach going to stop punishing you Ariff? I pity you. Nevermind. It's my fault anyway. If this was my father's academy,... ...you would've been expelled long ago. Always yapping about your dad. Like he's that great. At least I use a nice car. Not as though you, a taxi. You dare insult me? Cool down, Maro. What are you guys doing here? Can't you see who's on the field there? Hurry up! Training is about to start. Good morning, coach. I'm sorry I'm late. Training should've started five minutes ago, Ariff. Okay, I've got a present for all of you. Since one of your team mates is late,... ...all of you do ten sets of shuttle run now. Ten sets? But coach, I came early. You weren't the only one who came early. What are you waiting for? Shuttle run, now! On line, on line, on line! On line! Faster, faster, faster! What do you have to say to your friends, Ariff. They were punished because of you. I'm sorry. Let me repeat. There's no I or me in Anak Rimau there is only us. Who are we? -Anak Rimau Okay. Carry on training. Ariff, where are you going? -Take your positions! Training, coach. -No, you're benched. Pick balls. Zainal. And Jazlan as the keeper. I'm confident that this is the best formation,... ...for our team, Anak Rimau. I don't understand, why do you put Danish as midfielder? He's supposed to play centre forward. Because we have another striker that's better. Maro, he's hardworking, fast and smart. He's confident in front of the goal. Coach, we all know, Danish is much better than Maro. Mr. Wilson, I know my players better. I know their strength and their weaknesses. Mr. Zainal, you listen to me and you listen good. This game is important for Danish. I got scouting agents coming in. This is the best opportunity for Danish to qualify for a club... ...much better than here, do you understand? Mr. Wilson what I'm doing is what's best for the team,... ...not an individual, and not for Danish. Calm down, Zainal. Why don't we switch Danish... ...to a striker. We see how this works out. What on earth are you saying Wan, have you lost it? This is not a friendly game but one of great importance. Hear me out Zainal. If Danish get the attention of other clubs. We get the credit. Because we have the ability to groom players... ...which are spotted by more established clubs. This is important for our academy. Okay, let's change Danish to become striker. Wan! -My decision is final. Good. Thank you. Excuse me. What was that Wan? I can't believe you have the nerve to sell our players to clubs... ...instead of representing our region and make Malaysia proud. Nal, if we don't have people like Mr. Wilson,... ...we can't even afford to pay your salary. Ariff! What are you doing? -Training, coach. Training? Who asked you to? You're not even playing. Please forgive me coach, I really want to play. Let me play coach. Give me a reason why I should forgive you and let you play. It's because of football that I have the chance... ...to prove to everyone I am not a delinquent. Everybody compares me to my elder brother. My dad always scolded me, said I'm good for nothing. Back in primary school,... ...nobody noticed me, teachers ignored me. They didn't even remember my name. I'm not smart, so who remembers me. By joining this academy,... ...I'm able to make my mom proud of me. I'm only good at football, coach. I'm not good at anything else. I love football, I love my mom, I'm doing all this for my mother. Don't take football away from me, coach. Today, is the day for you to prove to yourself... ...if you are worthy of being called Anak Rimau. I know that each of you have been training hard. Putting in effort day and night. Learning all kinds of techniques and tactics with the aim to win. This the moment for you all to prove... ...that you can come together as one strong team... ...and defeat your opponents. Can you? -We can! Always remember our main objective. And that is to advance to the final round of the ASEAN Cup. What's our objective? -Final round of ASEAN Cup! These are the names of those who have been selected to play today. Danish. Maro, Taufiq. -Yes! Kaka. -Yes! Jazlan, Haziq, Nelson. Rahim, Zawawi. -Yes! Yusri. Wak. Izzat. -Yes! Badrul, Satesh. And Ariff. Thank you, coach. If you want to change the way people think of you,... ...we have to give our best, and believe that we can do it. Success will be achieved if we are brave enough... ...to grab each and every opportunity that comes our way. Now go out there, and prove yourselves! Can you? We can!! Anak Rimau! Aum! Anak Rimau! Come on, Maro! Bro, bro, clap harder and cheer for number seven. Hey guys, do you know playe number seven is no ordinary player. He's my flesh and blood. His father is my mother's, grandmother's, granduncle's, ...brother-in-law wife's, nephew's, cousin. He's also my next door neighbour. But not actually next door, but a few houses away. I just want you to know that I'm so proud! Let's cheer guys, come on! Maro! Maro! Maro! Maro! Come on, Maro! Come on, Maro! That's my nephew with the ball. Who? Who? -My nephew. Your nephew? Yes! -My nephew. If your boy is good, we are all related! Correct, correct. But if he's no good, I don't think she will brag about him. You're so right. Thank you, thank you for coming. I really appreciate it. Today my son, Danish, will be playing centre forward. That's him. Number nine. -Oh, number nine. Centre forward? -Yeah, excuse me. Okay, Go, Anak Rimau! Ridhuan, what is going on? What is he doing? I'm sure it's just a miscommunication. I'll talk to him later. You better talk to him, right now! I got two scouts here to see Danish play today. Now! Down, down, down! Mark each player. Don't forget to mark, one player each. Nal. Why is Danish playing midfield? Taufiq, Taufiq, mark him closely! Kaka, don't leave him. Nal, I'm speaking to you. I'm in the middle of doing my job, can you stop disturbing me. Nal, you need to do your job and so do I. I'm giving you an order now,... ...change Danish's position back to striker. Danish is not a striker, he's better playing midfield. Nal, look here, if Danish's father... ...pulls him out of our academy, where can we find sponsorship? Wan, I don't care about others. My job is towards the team, not just for somebody's kid. Don't let him posses the ball for too long! Badrul! Come on Yusri, come on Yusri. -Open up, open up. Shoot, shoot, shoot! That was so close, just so close. It's okay, it was a good try. Relax, we can try again. There's an opening Kaka, take it, take it Kaka. Goal! Come here, come here, hurry up. Nal, your strategy isn't working. What are you saying? We're currently at a tie. Don't lose your head. Okay, good job, boys. I know we were attacked non-stop back there,... ...but we succeeded in scoring a goal, well done all. We only have forty-five minutes remaining to win. Coach, how are we going to win? We hardly had any chance to attack. They attacked us seven, eight times, almost scoring a goal. We can win, coach. Their number 10 player is really fast. That's why, he was able to dribble past Zawawi and Taufiq with ease. But Nelson can suppress him, coach. Nelson is fast and sturdy. Let him mark number 10. Can you do that, Nelson? -Sure, Coach. Okay. Listen up. From this moment on, regardless of what comes our way,... ...this is the life and death situation for our team. Whatever we face, be it a storm, typhoon, rain, or an earthquake. Don't leave the field, do your best until we win. Until we what? -Win! Come on, form a circle, hurry up. Come on, boys! Let's go, boys. We can do this. Right now. Now let's do this short and sweet. Save energy, okay? Anak Rimau. You guys played well just now. Now are you ready to continue fighting? Ready? Yes! -Let's go. One, two, three, Garuda! Come on, Nelson. Nelson. Well done, Nelson. Thank you, coach. -Kaka is tired. Haziq, panaskan badan. Let's go, Haziq. Come on, Haziq. Coach, my stomach aches. I need to go to the toilet. You're about to go in. Haziq! -What's wrong with you? Is he really having a stomach ache? Rahim, panaskan badan. Come on, Rahim. Kaka! Kaka! Good game. What good game are you talking about? Do you think you all so good? Maro, how was it after scoring? -I'm happy. Happy? So you feel you're so good? Who else? Danish? Of course you feel happy, we won. Congratulations, good job, guys. You've proven that you can rise from the ashes. You don't easily give up and you eventually win. Well done. Myself, Coach Khalid, Coach Ramzan,... ...and Mat are very proud of you all. Congratulations and well done. I don't want to talk too much I know all of you can't wait to go back home. I just have one thing to remind you. When you go back home, get enough rest. Spend some quality time with your family. Control your food consumption. Why? Because there's another important match when you get back. One that we must win, do you understand? Understood. -Okay? Off you go. So, dad, how did I do? Did I get in? I don't know, Danish. What? But I scored the winning goal. Do you think that's good enough for them? For the scouting agents? Not even close. I'm so disappointed, Danish. What? -End of discussion. I think Ariff should be named as man of the match. I fully agree, if Ariff plays midfield, it's solid as a rock. If we don't have Tuck, we won't be able to win too. Tuck's really smart, just like his Jürgen Klopp. But guys, Danish scored the winning goal, right? But Ariff, didn't you see Danish steal the ball from Maro? Whatever the case, the important thing is that we won. I still can't believe that we won. The ball is round, right? I know that the ball is round Kaka. But what's more important, is that tomorrow I want to go back home,... ...and see my Sarok. I miss her so much. All you talk about is Sarok. You trained with P.S.G,... ...but you ran so slow just now. Why? What did you do last night? Did you sleep late? What did he do last night? Maybe played video games. -He played games? You played..... You guys go get some rest. I'm leaving, coach. Okey. Take care of yourself. Don't look for trouble and don't create problems for anyone. I'll try. I don't want to hear that you'll just try. I only want to hear a yes or a no. Understand? Do you know the problems that I have to face, coach? I won't know Ariff, if you don't tell me. On the field Ariff, I am your coach. But off the pitch, I am like your big brother. If you have any problems, tell me. I will try my best to help. As long as you're honest to yourself... ...and you're brave enough to tell the truth. Do you really want to know the problems that I'm facing? Mom. Sarok! Sarok! Sarok! Sarok! I missed you so much, Sarok. I haven't seen you for such a long time. Yes, Sarok. Look at our son, he rather hug the cow than his own mother. It has been two whole months since he has last seen his favorite cow. I love you both too. He loves his cow more than anything else. What time does Akil usually come home, mom? Don't ask such a question Ariff. I don't keep track of him at all. What time he goes out, and what time he returns? Have a drink. Thank you. What a good son. You make drinks for me. Mom. Here. -What is this Ariff? My allowance. And what are you going to use over there? The hostel already provides food. So I eat till I'm full, and if I'm hungry at night,... ...I'll just eat some biscuits or bread. Ariff, I've never asked you to stinge and save for me. It's okay, I don't need it. This is your money. Keep it for your own use. Mom, I've saved this especially for you. Peace be upon you! Hi, Ariff. You're back but you didn't tell me. If I knew, I would've arranged for a game tomorrow. I don't want to play anymore. I promised my Coach I won't play anymore. What do you mean you don't want play? I don't care, I still want you to play tomorrow. Did you not hear what I said? I don't want to play anymore. Akil! Your brother just got home, let him rest first, will you? You see mom, you love to keep on spoiling this boy. What's the use of being good at football... ...if you can't even help your family? Where's your allowance, I know you just received it. Hand it to me. I don't have it anymore. I've used it up. Give it to me! -I've used it up! What is this? -This is his football allowance. What do you want it for? -Don't interfere, mom. Go back to work. -Give me the money. You dare to push mom? -What's your problem? What is your problem? You take my money, give it back. Enough. -Return back my money! I don't care. I still want you to play tomorrow. Remember. Tomorrow! Just ignore him Ariff. Despicable son! Have a drink, Danish. Thank you. Hey, dad. What? -Where's mom? Having dinner with a friend. But she knew I was coming home today. Danish. We all know our responsibilities. So, should you? What do you mean? -My job is to bring... ...a scouting agent to the game. And? -All you had to do is... ...impress them. That is your responsibility. You are a striker. You are supposed to play the game well. But I did. I gave my best. Your best? Are you sure? I thought so. Obviously your best was never near the extended. You lacked technique. You were slow. And worst off all, you're not a team player. Now let me tell you something. Look at me! You need to buck up and stay focused. Make sure I'm not wasting my time and money. You understand? Do you? Good! Hey! You didn't even invite me to join you. You're not going home? -No. Why? I prefer to stay here, coach. Is that so? All the others couldn't wait to go back home. It's like this. I stay with my uncle. He has so many children. There are no beds in his house. We all sleep on the floor. You know what, coach? If my cousins had the chance to come and stay here,... ...they too wouldn't want go back. You stay with your uncle? Where is your mom and dad? My food's getting cold, coach. I'll just finish it now. Listen here. Instant food is not good for your body. The canteen is closed, coach. I don't know what else to eat. So I took this. You want to be a sportsman, right? Come on, follow me back. Follow you back? -Follow me back. So you think a football coach can't cook? Don't you want to try? -Yes! If you want to try, let's go, hurry up. What's happened to your boots? It happened during a game the other day. Opponents were rough. That's normal. Everybody wants to win. I know they want to win, but they didn't have to play that rough. Look at what happened to my boots. Dad, when I first entered the academy,... ...everyone there were so arrogant. But now we're all good friends. Just one rich kid left. He's still as arrogant as ever. That's entirely normal. He's still learning to adapt to his surroundings. He'll adjust in good time. What's important for you to remember Maro,... ...you have to be grateful that you are given the chance... ...to be a part the football academy. Just look around, there are so many others kids like you... ...who want to be like you, who want to be part of the academy. But they are not given the chance to. That you have to remember. -Okay, dad. There's also one more thing I need to remind you. You have to remember that such an opportunity... ...comes but once in a lifetime. Such will not repeat itself. Understand? What I actually mean,... ...is that whatever happens, you have to play with all your heart. To give your very best when you're training at academy. You must not easily feel tired or have the urge to give up... ...or run away. Don't do that. Why are you saying that? Because I'm just afraid... ...that you will feel burnt out by the training at the academy. Don't worry, dad. Maro. You have to remember this. Whatever happens, no matter how bad your team is,... ...and your team is facing defeat,... ...and even if there's only one minute remaining on the clock,... ...play your very best,... ...until you hear the final whistle, okay? Okay, dad. I promise. -Promise? Yeah. Dad, is this the fastest you can go? This is the fastest. What do you think this boat is? Look at how big this engine is. Maro! Stop playing around, dad. -It's raining. Dad. -Yeah? Where are we going dad? Hang on, I need to see a friend first. I need to pick up something. How far more? Not so far, we're quite close. I'm just afraid I'll miss my bus. Relax, this is an F1 engine, it's very fast. Yeah, right. I just asked you to help me a bit and now you look so feverish. That should be all right? Is there anything else? I think that's about it. -This is it? Is that all? -That's all. Hang on, Badrul. Can you help me with one last thing? Sure. Here it is, can you ask Rose to photocopy this? Is this all? -Yes, that's it. Nothing more. Okay. Coach! Mr. Ridhuan would like to see you. Now? -Yes. Thanks, Mat. Hey. Are you busy? -Yes? Yes, we're busy. Hi, Badrul. -Hi. Hey, Badrul, can you take these forms? Put them on the third shelf, sixth row at the back. Over there? -Yes. Zainal, for all upcoming matches,... ...I need you to field Danish as a striker. How many times do I have to tell you Wan? I will not give in to Wilson's demands. But we need him. How bad is our situation that we have to give in to sponsors. What do you know? I manage the finances. Oh, so it's all about money? So you rather pimp out these boys' talents for money? Hey Nal, our duty is to train and groom our boys. And once they have reached a certain level of proficiency,... ...we transfer them out to a better place. If that's the case then we will never ever have a great team! I'm talking about the team and you're obsessed about one player. To groom a star and to sell a star. Without a team, football in our country will get nowhere. I know Zainal, but this time I just need you... ...to push Danish. Just this one kid. I just don't understand you, Wan. You're the CEO of the academy. You know that this is a long term programme... ...for the general benefit of everyone. We're doing all this for our country. I'm the coach. I won't do something... ...that benefit's only one party for the short term. Nal, Wilson pulls Danish out of the academy,... ...withdraw his sponsorship, what am I to do? What am I to do? You choose, Wan. Choose between Wilson or me. Hey, Badrul, are you okay? Okay. Why? Nothing. Good job, all of you. You came a half an hour early and warmed up straight away. Good job. It seems that we should give you more days off. Then you'll return with more enthusiasm. Okay, before we start our training for today,... ...I will be taking over from Coach Zainal as the head coach. Calm down. Even though Coach Zainal is no longer with us,... ...you all must continue to train hard. Why did Coach Zainal leave us? -Satesh. Does he not care about us? -Yes, I know... ...that this news is a shock to everyone. But today's training must go on. We don't have enough time, got it? Understood. -Good. Coach. We have some bad news regarding Maro. Maro? -What about Maro? Now Maro, now. Jump! Boat, boat, boat. Dad. Dad. Wake up, dad. Dad. Wake up, dad. Dad. Wake up, dad. Dad! Wake up, dad. Dad, dad! Dad! Hands off my dad! Coach Zainal is no longer here. I'm trying to accept Coach Khalid, but I just can't. You think you're the only one. And Maro, I don't think he's coming back to the academy. What? Who says he won't be coming back? The academy has granted him leave. Leave from the academy? Who gives leave more than a week, Tuck? Our match is just around the corner. That's right. I think Maro won't be back with his father's passing. You guys give up too easily. Ariff, you're our captain. Your job is to motivate us. Not lose confidence yourself. Hey, what was wrong with Syed just now? Why did he try and challenge you? Hey Ariff, I think what Syed said had some truth in it. Why are you so discouraged? -That's right, Ariff. I think you need to do something. You are our captain. Okay, okay. I have a plan. Follow me, lets go. What plan? -Where are we going? Just follow me. -What plan? Come on Tuck, hurry up. Peace be upon you. -Coach. Hi, coach. -Quiet. What are you guys doing here so late at night? With the Anak Rimau jerseys. If the academy knows about this. What seems to be the problem now, captain? And you with your foot like that? I left the academy not because of you guys. But coach, Ridhuan scolded you, right? It's definitely because we didn't play well enough. It's difficult for me to explain to you what really transpired. But all you have to know is the reason why I left the academy... ...is not because of you guys and not because of your performance. Okay? Coach. -What is it, Tuck? Please, coach. Return to the academy with us. Please, coach. Please. We are so used to having you as our coach. Please, coach. Coach Khalid is not that good of a coach. On the pitch, you are strict. But we all know, off the pitch,... ...you're a good person. Please, coach. Come back. When you're not training us,... ...you're like our big brother. We can express ourselves freely. Okay. Listen carefully, Anak Rimau. All of you have to remember back. What is the main reason you all came to the academy? To play football or to be best friends with the coach? Didn't you come here to play football, Badrul? Do you still remember your first day, during registration? Did you think who would become your coach? No, right? Am I right? So go back to the main reason. You came to the academy to play football. Right? Football? The one thing that can make you happy, right? Do you all understand? Okay, let's go, I'm sending you back to the dormitory. But Coach. What about Maro, coach? What about Maro? Those boots can still be used Maro! Why do you want to throw it away? I understand how you feel. What are you doing here, coach? I don't want to play football anymore, coach. Why don't you want to play? There's no reason to. So what you mean is that you play football because of your father... ...and not because you love to? I know that your father wanted you to become a great player. To become a skilful player and to play like nobody else can. I know. And since he's no longer around,... ...you're losing your will to achieve his dreams. And now you feel like there's no point in carrying on anymore. I understand. Look. I won't force you to return to the academy. Okay? You can take as long as you want to mourn your loss. Okay? Your friends have something to say to you. Maro! You're a great player. If you stop playing, won't you regret it? Maro. Without you, we definitely won't be able to win. Come on Maro, trust me. Okay Maro, this is far enough. I'm going back, okay? Take good care of yourself. If you do have a problem, just call me. Okay? Coach, why didn't you... ...talk Maro into going back to the academy, coach? Coach. What about Maro? We can't force him to follow what we want. He just lost his father, right? It's not easy for him. We have to understand his situation. But Coach, if we don't have Maro, we definitely won't be able to win. Coach, we're bound to lose. Who said we are bound to lose? You have a lot of team mates who are really good. Kaka, Nelson, Yazid, Wak. You just don't see it. Coach Khalid will know... ...to find a replacement for Maro. Do you understand, captain? Hang on. Our journey in life will be more difficult if we... ...can't find the ability to trust others. Coach Khalid really trusts all of you. If not, he wouldn't have taken on my duties and replaced me. So you have to trust him in return. Put your trust in him just like you put your trust in me. Alright, let's go in. Okay, go, go, go. -Let's go Badrul. You're not dribbling the ball properly. You kicked the ball out again Badrul, well done. Go Izzat. -Come on, come on, come on. Ariff! You're kicking..... Come on. Come on, Haziq. -Go, Haziq. Haziq, why did you shoot when the ball was still so far? Go Kaka, go Kaka, faster, push it further. Push it further. You're too slow, Ariff! Push it further, Ariff! Hey! Ariff! Are you blind? -What was that Ariff? So far and you didn't shoot correctly. Ariff! Whats going on? If you don't want to play, go home. The same goes to you. Playing like girls. What's going on with you all? Can you all focus? Khalid listens to management. I'm sure Anak Rimau will win big today. Now you're talking. Oh, yeah. Of course. Danish! -Mark that guy! Why is Ariff playing wing? Ariff! Ariff play midfield. Midfield, Ariff, midfield! Mark number eight, number eight! Go, Haziq! Focus! Focus! Haziq! Haziq! Concentrate on the match, Haziq. Handle anything else after the match. Listen here, coach. Ariff needs to play midfield. He cannot play wing. Ariff! Ariff! Play midfield. What are you doing playing wing? Play midfield. Ariff, stay on the side. We attack from the wing. Play wing. Why wing? Midfield's empty. Stay with number nine! -Nal! Kaka, move up, penetrate their defense. Yazid! Yazid! Ariff! Back him up. Stay in the wing. Stay in the wing. Pass to Danish, pass to Danish. Yeah! Goal! Good job, good job! That's my son. Number 99, Danish. Yeah! That call looks important. He's probably asking his office to prepare the contract. This looks right. I think you shoul become the coach, Tuck. You have it in you. -Me? Yes. Unlike this guy. He's all brawn and no brains. There's no one playing midfield. It's open, Ariff. Okay, good job, everyone. We won today. Overall, everything's okay. Just lacking coordination. Ariff! I asked you to play wing, right? Why did you play midfield? You're lucky you had Danish. Danish, good job. You're the man, okay? Haziq! What happened? What were you thinking? You lost focus during the game just now. You're really lucky you had Nelson. All of you in defense played well. Keeper, you're the best, okay? Kaka, good job, good job. Defense, keeper, well done. Okay, everyone, eat, rest and sleep well. See you later. Yes! So, I appreciate your time. -Okay. Thank you for coming. Hope you enjoyed the game. This is the scouting agent. Hello. -Okay, bye. Yeah, that's my boy. Did I tell you you're the best? I tell you what? They're going to prepare the contract. Oh, yeah! Now I'll buy you dinner, okay? Okay. -Let's go. Coach. -Coach. So, are your studies good? No problems, huh? Abang Zul. When did you arrive? All okay? -Okay. I don't care, I still want you to play. I can't play, I've got training for the finals. The problem is, I've already promised all of them. So? It's you who promised them. Is it my fault? You never told me. You dare to fight back now? -That hurts. So you think you're that good now? You can't even help me anymore? This has nothing to do with me. This is all you. What you're doing is totally wrong. You dare talk back to me? You! What's up with you bro? Get lost, bro. What's up with you? -What's the problem? How are you? Okay? -Okay. What's your problem? -Enough, keep away. Enough! You've to go through me first before you hit him. You! When will you stop doing things that are wrong... ...just because you want to help your family? This is not being responsible. It just tears the family apart. My brother will hurt my mom, coach. You're not in my shoes. It's easy for you to say. Sometimes we have to sacrifice something... ...to achieve something better, Ariff. You have to learn to make choices and decisions,... ...even though it can be difficult. Isn't that how a captain should be? But no, you're just willing to take risks on the pitch. Off the pitch, you don't have the guts to be responsible. My job as your coach... ...is not just making sure you succeed on the pitch. But also in life. Do you understand? Don't worry. You made the right decision. Let's go. So it's true that you won't be here much longer? So it was a complete waste for Ariff to pass the ball to you? I want to ask you something. Why do you hate Ariff so much? He has nothing against you. He even went out of the way to help you. He even assisted your goal. He passed the ball to you. I never asked for it. He was the one who pass it to me. Do you know why he did that? Why? Because he wants you to accept him as your captain. This means a lot to him. He thinks he doesn't deserve being the captain. He thinks he's not good enough. He's not like you. You get whatever you want. Why are you keeping quiet? Here, this is for you. You're handing those to me? -My bag's full. Thank you. -If it doesn't fit,... ...just throw them away. -I'm sure it will fit. It looks brand new. It looks brand new. It must be expensive. How much did you buy this for? Danish? Danish! Danish! I haven't thanked you yet. It's okay, see you later. Keep some for me. What song? Just play. Police! Police! Police! Run! Run! Run! Run! What's this? What's going on? Let me go. Anak Rimau is waiting for you. Okay! Are you all ready? -Yes! Let's go! Tonight is the night. So stay focused. Play your best and fight till the end. Okay? Coach Khalid. Anak Rimau, I'd like to thank you for your passion... ...and congratulations on qualifying to the finals tonight. Give yourselves a round of applause. And, as a reward,... ...I've brought someone special for you guys. Coach! Coach Zainal! Mat. Are you all ready? Ready? Lets show everyone out there who Anak Rimau really is. Okay? Nal saya serahkan pasukan kepada anda. Khalid. -Yeah. Good job, Khalid. There, Anak Rimau. The moment of truth has arrived for a coach. Zainal Abidin is surely expecting his team... ...to perform their best... ...at this ASEAN Youth Football Invitation Cup 2020. Anak Rimau Academy will take on... ...Stomp Juniors who are representing Thailand. We can see so many Thailand supporters... ...in the stadium here tonight... ...here to throw their support for their home team. Being led into the field by match officials,... ...Anak Rimau led by Ariff as the team's captain,... ...to step into the stadium... ...and also counting on the viewers at home... ...as our twelfth player to show your support... ...no matter where you are watching this final match. Many supporters can be seen in the stadium... ...here to give their unreserved support to their teams. Anak Rimau clad in yellow and black jerseys... ...while the opposing team are donning jerseys in blue. The moment has arrived for all players... ...as they enter this final stage towards victory. With Coach Zainal Abidin fielding Jazlan,... ...Ariff as team captain, Nelson, Izzat, Wak, Kaka,... ...Satesh, Yusri, Zawawi, Taufiq and Aizat as his first eleven. And these are the away team's players to be feared of. Prakvit and their captain, Dison,... ...who are known to be formidable threats on the field. Awaiting the kickoff whistle from the match referee... ...for this match final. Stomp Juniors to start. Push up! Push up! Dison, the backbone of midfield, a player to be feared of. Kaka. Passing the ball to Yusri on the wing. Many are hoping that Anak Rimau will continue... ...to give their very best in tonight's action. Wak sending the ball to Nelson from the wing. A nice shot on the goal by Nelson, but he missed. Anak Rimau lost their chance to score the opening goal. It's all right. We'll try again. Wiraphon Tirasat, a former Thailand national team player. A formidable and well-respected coach. Dison, again with the ball, dribbling dangerously in midfield. Jazlan, use your voice, call your defense back faster. And this being the opportunity for the away team. This there chance to take a shot in front of the goal. Goal! Stomp Juniors take the lead. Opening goal, when..... We can see Aruson penetrating the defense... ...and scores a right footed shot on the goal. A failed save by Anak Rimau's goalkeeper. Providing Stomp Juniors with a 1-0 lead in the game. A tense moment for all. They were hoping for Nelson and Izzat... ...who were positioned as strikers to score for Anak Rimau. Satesh. A short pass by Izzat,... ...leading the game to the side once again. A probable strategy from Coach Zainal Abidin. Precision control. -Go! Nelson, go! A lot of play along the wings. Nelson with a shot on the goal and going wide. Satesh on the ball again. They're performing well in this first half. Kaka, losing the ball to his opponent. Hey what's going on? Stomp Juniors ripping through midfield. A through ball to Dison again. Dison dribbling past two players heading towards the goal front. Dison, a chance on the goal and a save by Jazlan. We can't go on like this. Our midfield is weak. Failing to save a goal just now,... ...a shot by Aruson. Kaka! Making a mistake again. -Don't let him get through. Allowing Dison to pass the ball over to Songkwan. Songkwan penetrating the defense with amazing footwork. Songkwan for goal number two. Beating Jazlan again. Stomp Juniors leading again 2-0. Holes in the defense,... ...allowing swift one-touch passes by Stomp Juniors... ...and ultimately obtaining their second goal. A celebration that surely becomes a disappointment... ...for the Anak Rimau fans to witness in the middle of the field. A first half, definitely not on Anak Rimau's side. There goes the whistle, wrapping up the first half. Do you want to know what our problem is? We, are so dependent on others. We believe so much that only Coach Zainal can make us great. We believe that only with Danish, Maro and Tuck,... ...when they're with us, then we can win, is that it? We concede that our opponents are far stronger than us. It's as though that when we play against them, we're sure to lose. Please, guys. I'm asking for your help. Believe in yourselves. Can you? Ever since I was young,... ...I believed that I was good for nothing. Everyone looked down on me. My own teachers at school, my very own father said... ...that when I grow up,... ...I'll be like my brother. Doing drugs on the street. Wandering around aimlessly. I believed all that. But after I joined this academy, I believe that I'm not that person. I want you all to believe, that we,... ...Anak Rimau, can go out there and win. Can we? -We can! I too believe, that you all can. I don't want to speak too much. I don't want to get angry. I just want to remind you all... ...that success will be achieved... ...as long as we have the courage to grab every opportunity. Don't put your self interest above all. Standing together and unanimity is more meaningful. Do you understand? Yes. One more thing. I have a surprise for you all. Hi, everyone! -Maro! Where did you go to Maro? Lift him up, lift him up! Are you all ready? -Ready! Anak Rimau! Let's go. I'm sorry, excuse me. Excuse me. -Okay. Oh no, we're down two right? -Yeah. It's okay, heroes always lose in the beginning. Whatever words of encouragement... ...Coach Zainal Abidin has given to his team,... ...we hope it has worked some magic to witness... ...the come back of Anak Rimau in the second half. With the entrance of Maro just a while ago,... ...we hope that it will... ...strengthen Anak Rimau's midfield. Anak Rimau on the wings. Good footwork by each team member. And a cross to the goal. A fantastic finish by Yusri. Goal! Anak Rimau closes in at 2-1. Wiraphon Tirasak seems disappointed as his defense collapses. Replace Yusri, backup Ariff and penetrate their defense. In these early stages of the second half,... ...Haziq coming in, another substitute... ...to replace Yusri who scored the first goal... ...for Anak Rimau earlier. We're hoping the goal just now will motivate... ...Anak Rimau on the attack, with Haziq passing the ball to Wak. A skilful push forward by Wak through the wings. Ariff in possession. Dribbling past his opponent. Ariff still on the ball. A superb shot on the goal by Ariff. Equalizing for his team. Yeah! Goal! Goal! Goal! Wiraphon is shocked in disbelief... ...seeing the ball pass through Thritiporn. Anak Rimau draws two-all. The second half has proven to be where all the action is. What transpired in the dressing room just moments ago... ...has proven to be the roar of Anak Rimau on the field right now. And here comes Syed, a pair of fresh legs... ...brought into the team by Coach Zainal Abidin,... ...who will replace Satesh who has played well throughout the game. This is Maro. His entry into the game... ...has proven to be one of great importance... ...as this can be shown by better coordination by team Anak Rimau. Maro, up against three opponents. Still grieving at the loss of his beloved father. Maro to Haziq on the left. Haziq with a cross to unmarked Maro at the goal. A chance for Anak Rimau. No matter how bad your team is losing during a game,... ..and even if there's only one minute remaining on the clock,... ...play your very best, until you hear the final whistle. And a chance for Maro. A flip... ...and Anak Rimau takes the lead, 3-2. Goal! What a goal, scored by Maro! Goal! The crowd goes wild here in the stadium. ...and I'm sure out there too after witnessing this... ...absolutely stunning goal of this final match. Supporters of Stomp Juniors still shocked in disbelief... ...as Wiraphon Tirasak joins their disappointment,... ...thinking how a two-goal lead in the first half... ...has resulted in a 3-2 come back by Anak Rimau... ...to emerge as champions for this 2020 season. Excuse me! Excuse me! Yeah! Pak Arab. We won. You're fantastic. But who made it all possible? Climb up here. Help me. Yeah. Danish! Danish! Congratulations, captain. -Thank you. But I want to ask you something. Why did you pass the ball to me the other day? Because, we're alike. Come on, lets go take some photos. -No, thank you. Where are you going? Let's go. Don't be shy. -I'm not a player for this team. Let's go, there they're calling for us. This is the cup that was challenged for by Anak Rimau,... ...Stomp Juniors and also by teams from Singapore,... ...Indonesia and the Philippines. But Anak Rimau has emerged victorious... ...to be crowned champions of this year's tournament. Congratulations to Coach Zainal Abidin on his victory! This is my team now. In our quest to achieve the dream we all longed for... ...was in no way easy. But with determination and teamwork,... ...we finally succeeded. Who are we? We are Anak Rimau.
