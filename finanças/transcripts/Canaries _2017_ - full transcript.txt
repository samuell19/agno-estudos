Ah shit. Lieutenant Randall. Yes damn it. Wilson sir, RAF. Hey do you mind? Sorry sir. Which way? You know why I joined the US Air Force Wilson? No sir. To see my beautiful country, and to be in the air. Instead I'm walking through a freezing English forest because one of your guys said he saw a light. You're commanding officer felt somebody from both countries should investigate sir. My commanding officer is a dick. Shine it over here. Resin, trees been exposed to heat. Camp fires? No sign of one. Shine up. Branch is broken up in the tree-line. Something came down, your man might have seen something. Okay, let's move off this, shit what the hell is that? We have a body sir, looks Vietnamese what's left of him. I think I stepped on some of him. We're close, I think, that's what the map says. That's where the lady is. Why you want to talk to this lady? Plenty of nice girls in Hanoi. No, no, no thanks, ah this lady witnessed an abduction, her friend was taken. So we go to police? Oh I don't think so, she said a craft appeared as big as three of those mountains up there. Craft? A UFO. UFO right, sightings in Vietnam are actually quite common. Urgh, oh God, I think I got a fly in my mouth. That's disgusting. This is her. Hello, don't be afraid. Where was her friend standing? And where was the UFO? Yes, I can confirm that, that's a definite, yes ma'am. Several, at least 10, they're all in separate containers. Well some are mac and cheese and some are sandwiches. Because she likes them Patrice, there's fruit in there too okay. Look, I got to go, yeah, yeah I'll be home late tonight okay, bye. Agent Kendrick. I don't really have a title, just call me Kendrick. Yes sir. Where? Up island. Scene secure. Private beach, owners don't come til August. Not much to secure really. Oh let me get this. Estimated TOD. Uh hi, who are you? This is agent, this is Mr. Kendrick. I'm estimating time of death is when he hit the ground, six o'clock this morning, in front of two 15 year olds. One of them my stepdaughter who's now grounded. Small community. They claim they saw flashes of light and then Ben Murphy and his crew disappear from his boat a little ways off shore. A local fishing crew. The boat? Pulled it in this morning, no sign of the crew, nothing suspicious on the boat. The girls had ingested several office cleaning products. The wounds indicate? He fell from pretty high up, as in from a plane. ID? Found this in his pocket. Kurt Nesbo. Says he's from Oslo, also found this in the wallet. Ticket to a gala show or something, Oslo opera house. But it's dated April 30th 2013, that's almost a year from now, he must have really want to see that show. This ticket's been torn, he saw the show. He, sorry he what? ID was confirmed, Kurt Nesbo of Oslo Norway. Cause of death, injuries from a fall. All flights that evening were grounded due to the storm, over one year later we track reports of a Kurt Nesbo, same ID, disappearing from a gala at the opera house at Oslo during intermission. Sorry, DC Metro sucks, why are we in a hotel? We own it. ID, Stanley. Gillman. DOD owns a hotel. Sit down. The same time the body dropped that image was sent to us. Sent? Sent in the mail, on a phone that hadn't been invented yet. Well, they don't know how to spell happy. We got IDs on any of these guys? One of them's MOD. Ministry of Defense UK. Yes, thank you I know what it means. Do we have a map? You show up late to an eyes only briefing and you, you would like a map. Like a really big map that we can put pins in. Do you see a pattern? Let me save you some energy, we know where it's gonna happen next. Okay how? They told us. They told you? They? What did they say? They have a proposal and they want us to see it happen again. Where? Lower cumtrch, lower coom, lower cum, lower cumtwa, how do you even say that? Huw Richards has called in, saying there's a New Years Eve party in Lower Cwmtwrch. Not to be confused with Upper Cwmtwrch of course, where the special DJ host, sponsored by Selwyn Reese, the fishmonger. Nothing fishy, just delishy. Might want to think about hiring a new marketing team Selwyn, just kidding, or am I? Welsh language radio is coming up in a mo, but first here's the new classic. Hi there, you're through to Steve Dennis, the Microphone Menace, do you know what to do, oh I think you do. Oh Steve where the fuck are you? You told me to meet you here, it's your party in it, give me a ring back alright, it's Huw bye. They're mine. You're fit but you're not that fit. Yeah right. So is this where you give me the speech. What speech? It was fun, but you're a famous DJ, need to get back to London, don't have time for anything remotely serious, blah, blah, blah. No I, I wasn't gonna say that. Okay. No what I was gonna say was, if I'm honest I'm not a good person and that nice guy veneer from the radio is easy to sustain on the airwaves but let's face it, we were both just in this for ourselves, you know, for personal gain. So I think it's best if I just leave. But although we only had a few hours, we had the passion of a lifetime. That's from a film, that last thing you just said, that's from The Terminator. You couldn't even be bothered to watch a Rom com and steal something from that. You decided to quote a film about a killer cyborg who travels through time. It is romantic to be fair, no it is, at the end... Fuck off Steve. Thanks. Okay good, I never liked you okay. Thank you for that Steve. Good, well thanks for everything. Thank you. Take care. You too. I'll get dressed downstairs so don't worry about... Bye Steve, thank you. Bye then. Bye. Good. Hi, sorry I missed your call, I was in a meeting. Yeah, yeah, you told me to meet you here at eight, it's your party mate. Yeah, how many takers? A few, not many. Just a few. There's a big New Years Eve thing at Cinders, a lot of people going to that. Look I've got an investor coming from London, I need more people there, please Huw, just get me some more fucking people. Thanks. Miles, Sunita, whenever you don't call me for this long I know something's going on. So I am moderately concerned, call me back, bye. There's something about this guy you keep calling. Who says it's a guy? Because your voice goes funny. It's work thank you. Yeah, well you're always on the phone. Am I, do you wanna try and take it back. Go on, do you wanna try... This is a holiday alright, so we need to stay away from technology. That's bloody Steve. Hello Steve. Why did I come back to Wales? You tell me. Someone's nicked my fucking car. Hi Steve. Oh is that Suny, how's she doing? Still my sister. Half sister isn't it. She has my full protection. I was just checking mate, how far away are you? About 45 minutes. Call me when you're five minutes away, I'll tell you which pub. Great. What, nothing happened Naveen. Yeah. Oh that's a big screen, nice. Would have been nice if we had it earlier. Excuse me. I mean that's not just in the movies right, they do have those situations. They do have those yes, do you know the budget that gets allocated to this department? Seeing as how it officially doesn't exist. You want to be in agriculture, they get a lot of money. You should see the size of the TVs and conference rooms for them. I hope I'm not out of line here sir, that file implies that time traveling aliens are doing experiments on humans and making a power play. Isn't this an imminent threat? Not to us, they come at us, you'd be seeing that on a very big screen. Weather reports. Cloud and rain up in Scotland, but due to blow north not south, you wanna tell me what we're looking for? You'll know it when you see it. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Jesus. Steve Dennis, good job I hid you could have been someone coming to rob the place. Not me, I just broadcast criminally good entertainment. You remember me from school Steven? I tried to teach your geography, I failed, but I tried. Mr. Jones, Robert Jones. Yes of course, Bobby J, Bob the Bones. No, I just made that name up. Alan Thomas. Yeah, Mr. T. Made that one up as well. Yep, Mr. Jenkins. Sergeant Jenkins. Got my old job as a copper back. Plus I own the pub. Right, well congratulations. I'm on duty tonight. Oh I'm sorry. No, I love it, feel of the streets. Well it's just the one street really isn't it, and a few lanes. Parties, noise complaints, I'll be on that. You're having a party aren't you Steven? Just a little shindig, nothing um, warming up from about 3 PM, mellow stuff initially before we kick into the drum and base. Might have to stop by. Yeah do when your shifts done, I'll save you a few drinks. Check on the noise, bye bye now. I actually just fancied a pint. Tata. Okay. Nice to see you sir. Twat. So how you been Suny everything alright? Yeah, good, you? Yeah great, really great, good thanks. Now to Steve Dennis the microphone menace. Hey it's me, it's the show. Not live obviously because we're in the car. Pre-recorded that's what we call that. Soon I'll be menacing again when I phone some feminists to ask for their bra sizes, if you're gonna burn 'em, got to earn 'em. Now we've had lots of emails in for Steve's... There he is. What is your favorite hole? You can park over there. That's Naveen. Didn't you used to work the Viceroy? No, no, no he didn't, no that's a mate of mine from London with tons of cash and that's his sister. So no, none of your jokes alright. What jokes? Any of the ones that you tell. ♪ Burned by my velvet dreams He's not using a turn table? Well turn tables were out, and then they were in, and now they're, well actually they're still in, we just couldn't get one, could we Tony. Nah. And you know Steve how? Friends of his moms, and we run the local B&B. If his venture gets off the ground, then we'll give his guest DJs a discount, won't we Ton. Aye. His venture? Yeah, Valley Palace. Sorry? VIP Nightclubs in the valleys. He wants to set something up back here what with them probably firing him in London you know. Oh my fucking mouth. Hi, is there a corkscrew anywhere? Sorry? A corkscrew? Corkscrew? Yeah, yeah, I bought some wine. Yeah I know what it's for. Don't say anything will you. Of course not. Stick some 90s stuff on Steve, oh, oh. So there is a corkscrew yeah? No, sorry. ♪ Ain't got much money, ♪ Got some David Bowie, ♪ Now the whole damn bar's singing bad karaoke ♪ ♪ Like oh you pretty things ♪ Does anybody in here wanna buy me chicken wings ♪ ♪ Enough about supper all I need is ♪ ♪ Barkeep pour me another ♪ Back to the club would you take him for a sucker ♪ Hey there. Hey. Still at the travel agent? Yep. Valley Palace. No, fucking Ryan. Is that why I'm down here? What do you mean? Because of Nav, he could invest and it would seem odd not to invite me. I thought you both might like a nice weekend out of the city. I don't know why you act so weird around me Steve. Is it because something happened, or because not enough happened? Here's the thing Suni, you, me, we, had a great few moments but ultimately each person had to protect their own interests. When you think about it we were both just in it for ourselves. Unbelievable. Thank you. You said the same thing to me the next morning. The funny thing is you probably don't even remember what happened, would you like me to remind you? No, if I could potentially not be full of shit do you think it might be possible to... Excuse me can you turn the music down please. Ah, hello again. Agnes, Agnes Dee. Very good, Agnes Davis, it is printed on all the red gas bills in the hallway so you're not exactly Sherlock. Go back inside shall I. I'm comin' in. Hello. Hi. Agnes D, see told you I remembered your name. My dad lives on the next farm, he wants the music off. Can I do anything to change his mind? He's a raging alcoholic, I could take him a bottle of vodka to act as a sort of sedative. But in return I would require a bottle for myself and an invitation to this doubtless amazing party. Um. Oh go on, I'll even throw in a cover story about how we're just platonic friends, so you can try and shag the Indian bird, she's very pretty. We're just friends. We're all just friends. This way. Yeah. So all that... I thought you were in the hallway. No you're mistaken. Right. Just had a large cloud mass form over Calais within seconds moving west. Here it comes. Smells good, what's on it? Pepperoni. Vegetarian, thanks for checking. Huw, stop drinking now, alright, that's it, nice big smiles, one, two, three. Happy New Year. Happy new Year. Good. Give us a look then, give us a look. ♪ Tonight ♪ Whoa ♪ Whoa ♪ Tonight ♪ I know you love me for a Bit quiet for New Years Eve isn't it? Normally packed in here, fucking Steve Dennis. Sorry. Another shandy? No I'm fine with this one thanks. Well, I'm fine with my scotch. Right. Can I ask you a question? What? Is anyone round here having a party? Do you recognize any of these people? Never seen them. Okay great stuff, Right. And it wouldn't be new years eve without some odd phone calls, here we have some listeners reporting UFO's in Neath. Neath. Mr. Barnes, you gonna pay for that shandy. Alright, I love what you've done with the place, really nice, tinsel, Happy New Year. Fucking weirdo. Hello! Hello! If this is Huw having a girly giggle, I will plant mushrooms on you, fucking will as well! What the fuck are you playing at? How you doing? It's the microphone menace. That's right it is me. So boys grab your girls, boys grab your boys whatever, I don't judge, almost that time of the evening where I get to wish you a Happy New Year. Alright let's do this, let's start this countdown. 10, nine... Whoa, whoa you're 30 seconds out Steve, it says on my app. Oh, I'm 30 seconds off, that's fine, I can fill, I can do this. Yeah. Thank you's I guess. Nav, Suni I love you guys coming all the way from London, you are brilliant thank you. Ryan and of course the gorgeous Tommy offering wonderful deals at the Peacock B&B. Go and stay there if you're gonna stay anywhere. And who else, oh yes, there he is, the main man, Selwyn Reese and his fried fish. Yeah. If you want a piece of skate, get to my mate, I think have I done it, that's it, okay let's go, let's countdown proper. 10, nine, eight, seven. Happy New Year. Alright, alright, everyone calm down, that's fine, just stay in doors, don't go outside, we'll work out what this is. I'll be back with you soon, thanks, thanks. Sorry, sorry. Stevo. Oh. What? What just happened. What? Come in Steve, it might start up again. I'm a valley boy Rye, not afraid of a few drops. If you're such a proud valley boy, how come you changed your accent the minute you moved to London? What? You used to sound like me. What's up there? Can you see anything? Shit! Fuck me. Sorry. Is that a spear? Maasai. What? It's in Ecola, it's short for close attacks. African Maasai tribe, see the blade has a distinctive fish shape. Masters in anthropology. Yeah well don't take it inside, I've only rented the place. Sunita, you're keeping odd hours. Sorry to disturb you sir. I take it this isn't a drink and dial to say how much you appreciate me as your new boss. We may have a Canary incident sir. May have a what? This would make it the second after Rendlesham sir. Do not mention Rendlesham. Rendlesham was a long time ago, it's probably best forgotten two soldiers from two countries disappeared, we had to tell their families they died in a train accident. Oh the Yanks kicked up a fuss. It has a similar MO sir, foreign corpse, sudden impact, no sign of aircraft. How can you tell? It just fell on the party I'm at. On the house. Bit weird in it? That's putting it mildly. Oh look at me with my red wine and my long words. Have you got a problem mate? Yeah I fucking have actually. Why don't we step outside. We are outside. And what can you confirm about the body? I can't quite yet sir, it's still on the roof. It did drop this though. There's something on the roof that may or may not be a corpse, and you have a funny looking stick. Sir... Oh I knew you should never have lead me to the Yanks. They filled your head with spaceships. A Viennese boatman dropped on Rendlesham in 1980, then disappeared in 96, they tracked him, definite ID. Yes, says your friend Miles Kendrick, who for some reason only has a level five clearance. Sunita listen, aliens don't exist, time travel does not exist. Happy New Year. Get a towel, you don't mix red and white... Oh you're fucking asking for it pal. Yeah. Yeah I'll knock that little smug look right off your face. Alright just back off man. Yeah you back off. Huw, Huw mate please. Oh what so it's fine if you're a famous fucking DJ or a rich knob but if you work in a pub you can fuck off is it. He's not gonna give you his money anyway, your Valley Club ideas fucking rubbish. Fuck! Fuck! Fucking hell I'm so sorry, that was me again. What is that? What the fucks going on here in Wales? Is this normal? Fuck sake. What now? Observe and report. That's it? Orders. I can't do my job if I don't know what the objective is. You've been told exactly what... What is your job title? Same as you, analyst. Really, you look like you analyze people who are tied to a chair. What are we doing here? Listen to me. Can you hear me, hello yeah. My names Huw Richards, I'm a barman at the Cross Keys, that's not important, look a dead black man just fell out of the sky onto my house. Well it's not actually my house, I'm renting it, and also there was this rain right, and then it just turned off like it was a big fucking tap in the sky or something. So can you send coppers, an ambulance, hello. Oh I got cut off. Yeah or they've hung up. I'll try calling them. Steve. Yeah. I need to make sure my dad's okay. No one's going out there til we know what's going on. I've seen the body, that's not gonna hurt me is it? Yeah but Agnes seriously. Look, if one of those has fallen on my dads roof he's gonna freak out. I'll go with you. We should all go, it could get worse. Uh, it could get a lot worse outside actually, besides we don't want to see a dead body thank you very much. Look the other way then, scaredy poof. Do you want a fucking beating? As if you could. I'm black belt in Wing Chun. What's that, fucking flower arranging. Boys, Nav what'd they say. I don't think they believed me. You're a nutter sis. We'll be fine. We stay together, we stay together. There's nothing out there. We stay inside. There's nothing out there. Wing Chung There's nothing out there. We stay inside. There's nothing out there. We stay together. There's nothing out there. Win Chung. We stay inside. So how do you know Steve? Is he really worth talking about? No actually, what do you do in London? Travel agent. Really? What about you? I work for the local paper. Oh, a journalist. Councils Binbag Blunder, hardly Watergate. I can tell when people are lying though. I still can't get signal. Just gonna check Lisa hasn't burnt down the B&B. Your phone is shit. Where's yours? In the car. Be careful it's muddy Love you. Yeah whatever. ♪ Are you from Scotland, nu, I am from Wales. ♪ Alright mate. Fuck off. ♪ Are you from England, no ♪ Are you from Scotland, no ♪ Are you from Ireland, no ♪ I'm from fucking Wales. Ah there you are. Got you, you little fucker. Please! Do you mind if I go in on my own, my dad might be? Sure. The assailant wore a yellow mac... Dad. And appears pale and crazed. I don't think he's anyone's catch of the day. Dad, you awake? Dad. Dad? Dad. Gerrant, come too, it's a party, it's a party. Let's get drunk and make some mistakes. Slightly inappropriate time to be taking Es. NHS, when did you call the police? Half an hour ago. Brilliant, hardly anything. You know this isn't exactly how I planned it, and Huw and everything I... Did you really used to sound like him? Yeah a bit, but no London station wants a DJ sounding like that now do they. Suni's always sounded the same, but I grew up sounding like my mom. I got picked on big time, kids doing impressions of me, they sounded more Welsh then Indian. I changed the way I spoke to fit in, Suni'd never have cared though. I suppose that's why I'm so protective of her. Not that she needs it. Pale and crazed. Pale and crazed. Getting some reports on the ground. We have people there? Just the local police, reports of bodies falling from the sky, civilians with stab wounds. Shit. I want as many feeds as we can, satellite, HCL, traffic, whatever we got. It's a party, it's a happy, happy New Year party. 2015, and all the Londoners coming down, ooh look at me I've got nice hair and my sister's fit. Hey, cork it. But I haven't finished my set yet. Why haven't we had any complaints? What? The neighbors, and where's Tommy? I don't know mate, I do not keep track of all the gays. I've been working on a series of adventure novels about this sort of DJ explorer. I could write you one. Have you seen my waste of a boyfriend? Not for a while no. If he's found the weed in the car. Thomas. Maybe I could write like a chapter where... Stop talking Steve. Yeah, happy New Year. Thomas you found the fucking hash didn't you? Thomas! Fuck. Come on! Come on. What the fuck. David. This isn't a true representation of Valley Palace. Shut up Steve. You know, Huw promised me like 600 guests, honestly. Shut up Steve. You alright Sis? Where's the key for the door? Something's chasing us, it just killed Tommy. Fuck I'm gonna hide, see you. We need to stay together. There's nothing out there. We stay inside. I don't know what all the noise is about but I'm going outside to get myself some more beer. ♪ I see the rain falling down Shit. Get it please, get it. Shit, shit. Jesus, fuck off. What? This is my hiding place, fuck off. Where are I gonna hide? Not my problem. I'll give you a fucking problem, budge up. Fuck off. No go. Jesus, fucking, fuck. There was a fucking corkscrew. Come on, come on, come on. I got him, I got him, get the spear. Get the fucking spear. I can't find it. I can't hold him, I can't hold him. Oh fuck. Shit. You cunt. Fucking touch my mustache you fucking prick. Found it. What the fuck are they? I don't know, just want them to go away. Sunita. We've been attacked. If you would like me to call them terrorists instead of aliens I will. I believe you, a corpse similar to the one you encountered landed only two miles from here. We are in lockdown, I've got no agents within a 20 mile radius of you, but I'm tracking you okay. I'm tracking you and I've informed local police. Police are otherwise occupied sir. Sunita listen, listen, it seems the higher ups haven't been entirely honest with either of us. Rendlesham wasn't the first incident. Hey the phone reception was rubbish and now it's totally gone because of the weather right. That relies on transmissions through the air. Internet is mainly cables underground. There's no Wi-Fi here, but I'm picking up a signal in another house, really faint. You wanna what, email the police? No I want to get hold of someone who might know all about this. Oh yeah, like hello we've been attacked and killed by vampire fisherman, do you have an opinion on that. Only my friend Sunita thinks it might be your area of expertise. Shut up Steve. Look we all know at this point that I don't actually work for a travel agents right. Yeah, I was wondering when you were gonna tell me. So what are you then? MOD. You've got a Masters of Interior Design? Ministry of Defense you fucking knob, where's the I in that? Piss off, do I look like I belong in a spy thriller? No, no I don't, no my job is, and hopefully will still be to provide quality and slightly adult entertainment to an impressively large number of London listeners. And yes, actually, I did think that working in a travel agents was beneath Sunita's skill and intelligence level but I didn't want to point that out, did I, no because I thought it might be rude. As opposed to suggesting that you, me, and the girl from the radio station have a threesome. What! No, no, no. No I didn't say that. Yes you did, you just don't remember. I will destroy you. Off topic, off topic, slightly fucking off topic everyone. Tah! So, Ministry of Defense. Field agent, I was on loan to the Yanks, there's someone over there, an American version of me but a bit more senior, he's the guy I need to get hold of. Right so we email him? I can try and secure a web cam, DOD scrambles the signal well enough so no one can peek in. So we can Skype him then? Only in a top secret sort of way. Yeah. Great, who's got a laptop? I have. Where is it? Why didn't you bring it inside? Who brings a laptop to a party? Besides we need to get to where the wireless signal is strong enough, wherever this house is. Let's look, pinkywoofwoof85, that's Lisa Bevan's house, it's only a little walk away. How far is a little walk? Not long, probably will feel longer in this context though. Why can't you just webcam him from your phone? Because the signals not strong enough, it doesn't have a booster like the laptop. Great. Alright, me and Nav go, you two stay behind. Well I should go, we'll get there quicker. Which leaves me here alone, so no thanks, I'll come as well please. Yeah, but someone has to stay and hold down the fort Steve. This isn't a fort. You know what I mean. This is a rented holiday cottage which I've almost certainly lost my deposit on. Oh for fuck sake Steve. Alright, we all go. I go to the car first with Nav, Steve and Ryan you stay behind, keep a look out, give us the all clear. Then Steve you join us at the car, then Ryan. Two and one, one cover formation, then we find this house with a signal understood. Yeah. Yeah. Clear. I'm sorry about Tommy. I was on the rebound with him, he wasn't the one. I feel a bit bad that I don't feel badder. Probably just the shock or something, I don't know. I'm sure you'll meet someone nice. I did meet a bloke actually, down the pub. He looked a bit, I'll tell you some other time shall I. Yeah. Oh for, yeah that's brilliant that is. Hurry up. Yeah alright! Got the keys. Chuck them then. Jesus. One, two, three. The fuck was that? Steven Dennis did this. You tell that little shit he's under arrest. What's that? Oh it's so that I can see and keep my hands free for fighting. You look like a tit. I'll be the tit who survives. Here we are, this is it. It's a post office. They live upstairs. You guys stay down here, Steve and I will check upstairs. The signals strongest up here, I'm gonna try calling, keep watch. Alright look away, I'm entering passwords protected by the official secrets act. Stop showing off, I wouldn't let you see my pin number, it's basically the same thing. Give me any DOD satellite we have in the area, I need as much coverage of I need to take this. The cloud cover has grown to twice it's size. I'll be as fast as I can. It's spreading. It's what? Cloud cover. It's moving outward. They wanted us to see this. Shock and awe. What? You don't just attack somebody, you show them what you can do first. You rattle them, you scare them, then when you do go in, they're not fighting back, they're negotiating. He may not answer. Anything's worth a shot at this point. Sunita. Miles. Is this secure? I tried calling, all phones are out. What are we looking at? I can't tell you. Which means you know, that's why you didn't return my calls. Trust me I wanted too. We're getting slaughtered here Miles. Men in raincoats, discolored skin, they can... Did they look like this? Who are they? Crew of a fishing boat, disappeared from an island in Massachusetts two years ago, they may have been replicated. What cloned? It's possible, I've seen it myself. You could have given me some kind of warning, tell your friends to stay out of Wales, something like that. You were meant to be there. What are you talking about? This was sent to us in 2012. Hey that's me, that was taken tonight, how did you get that? You shouldn't be talking to me Steven. He's right, you shouldn't see his face. Yeah too late, who are you, how'd you know my name? Who is this knob? Ex colleague, tell us about them, we need to know everything. We don't know what they are, but we know they're doing experiments and they've contacted us. How? Don't bother it's classified isn't it. I shouldn't even be talking to you. Yeah listen mate, you're US government right. One small section, a section that doesn't officially exist but yes. Whatever you can help us okay, I want you to send helicopters, jets, anything, better still... We've been ordered to observe and report. Nothing more. Un-fucking-believable. What? Look, this is above my pay grade but it seems a deal has been struck. They get to do their experiments anyway but the US and we let them. In exchange they do us no harm, and they stay away. Wait, wait, wait, wait, what about our special relationship? The way you need to look at it, and I mean this, we're not good enough for you. Our two countries may have allied for a time, but you always knew that we were both in this for our own gain, I guess you could say it was fun while it lasted. Now we've clarified that, any handy hints. The rain. What about it? Every time these events occur, there's always been a rain storm. We had the labs analyze the liquid, it's not water, not strictly speaking. Some of the chemicals that we found are... Look we haven't got much time so. The fisherman are the first humans to come down alive, if you can call that, they had the same liquid in their lungs and in their bloodstreams. They're prototypes, like baby sharks, still learning how to kill. And you better move fast because they will adapt. So they've been injecting people and now they've perfected the dose they're sending them down to kill us. We hadn't confirmed that that was their intention. Yes it is, I can state 100% for the record that it is, it's bloody is, it's confirmed. They are alien human hybrid killing machines. This guys a real wanker did you used to go out with him? I can hear you man, I am right here. I wish you were right here, I'd fucking... You'd what, DJ me to death? Oh you are so bloody dead. Boys! Look I have to go, this call will have been monitored. If it were up to me... But it's not. No, good luck. Yeah I'm never eating another hot dog again, fuck off. The storm front's covering most of Wales at this point. You can see the other weather is moving north east with the wind, but this is just hovering, it's static. What do you think? I think we're approaching plan B. I made a new years resolution to stop eating these. What is that? It's a tennis racket with knives in it. Sis, we've got to go. Whoa, what about your laptop. Not a laptop anymore. Alright, out the back, no noise. What the hell is that? It's a tennis racket with knives in it. You'll have someone's eye out. That's the idea. I'm older then you. Why aren't they crossing, is it the water? Are they allergic to it? Rain coats, whatever liquid they were using it was too strong and people came down dead. Like the African man. They were overdosing them, but the raincoats protected them just enough and now their test subjects are surviving they're giving them to everyone. Like armor, or a condom. You know for me, it's that photograph. The fact that it was taken tonight but the American's had it two years ago. Forget all that other freaky shit we've seen, it's that that gives me the willies more then anything else. Fuck. Guys. Does this ever come to an end? I, I don't know, I just remember coming here to get drunk. Any ideas. This is usually when we call for air support. You know what we used to do when we were in school and someone would make fun of you. You'd look at the bastard, remember. You'd look in his ugly face and you'd fucking charge. Don't be stupid. Naveen! Come on! Come on you fuckers! Steve I've decided not to invest in your Valley's club scheme, it's a rubbish idea. No! Suni, take care of Steve, he's an idiot. Naveen! Naveen! Leave him, it's too late. Come on. Naveen! Suni come on. Let me stay, Steve. I can buy you some time. No Suni, come on listen. Let go. Suni Nav stayed so we don't have too, now come on. Get up there. I gotta join a gym, I gotta join a gym, I gotta join a gym. Steve, Steve! No benefit, no, no, it won't make any difference. Steve! Steve! What happened? Nothing, I fell, come on. Oh for fuck sake. Alright then. So what time shall I pick you up? What? For tea. I'm gonna take you for tea tomorrow, there's a great place in Llandilo that does tea and cakes. Sounds nice. It really is, it's brilliant. Really strong Earl Gray. I'm more of a Darjeeling girl. Uh, they do that as well. So what time? Shall we say 10, I'd like a lie in. Okay, 10s good. Let's deal with this first shall we. Sunita Chowdra. Yeah. Come with me. Come on. Fuck. Hold this will you. You're not MOD, black ops, CIA? Special branch, I'm a friend of a friend. Mr. Kendrick you've been assigned back out in the field, they've sent someone else here to supervise. Someone higher up you mean. They're not telling us anything. Take care of yourself. That's gonna cost you. I thought we agreed to meet in private. Oh I can't think of any place more private then a hotel owned by the DOD. Saving the girl has altered things. We had requested that you not do that. You requested that we change nothing in the United States and in return that you would not conduct anymore of your experiments here. Yes. Seems like we're both liars. Takes one to know one. I have a report here of storms and bodies in Hawaii. Oh that didn't have to happen. I thought everything had to happen, you've seen it happen. This is just one possible outcome. You end up as me. Let's be clear, you are not me. You have my body, the rest of you, God knows what that is. God has nothing to do with this, you know those people in the temples had it right. What did you call them, the ones that drew all those maps, they predicted a cleansing rain would come and wash the world away. The Mayans, that's it. The last people who used the word cleansing we kicked their ass. My superiors may think that they can negotiate with you but I know a take over when I see one. We're not done. It won't make any difference. The government has declared a state of emergency, inbound and outbound flights too and from the UK canceled indefinitely. Civilians are encouraged to remain indoors or proceed to emergency rendezvous locations. Those with any military or combat experience are encouraged to make contact with the armed forces. If you can please volunteer. Britain has repelled invasion before, and it will do so again. We shall fight on. Can you get us somewhere safe? No, there's nowhere safe anymore, we'll have to fight our way out.

That's an affirmative Griff, returning to base with four survivors, including the woman with the spear. Repeat, returning to base with four survivors. Have you had any luck finding anyone, over? Yeah, I've found two soldiers, one British, one American, pretty out of it. They said they were in a forest at night in England, five minutes ago, I asked them what year it is, they say it's 1980.
