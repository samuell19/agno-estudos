DRAMA DEPARTMENT OF CHANNEL ONE Editor-in Chief Vasilije Popovic WARD Based on a story by FILIP DAVID Screenplay DJORDJE KADIJEVIC Dramaturgist BOJANA ANDRIC CAST Can I come inside? What's with you, man? Look. Can you see that? Who? Who is that? No, please, don't. I beg you, don't do it. Close up, please. Close it. It's closed. - No one can get inside? And who would want to get in? I'm not alone. Who is with you? Didn't you see? Yes. Tell me who you are. My name is Mihailo. Where are you taking me? - To a room with a bed. You should rest. - Please, don't. I'm not tired. Can I stay here? You can. Who did you see? - Who knows. Good Morning. - Morning. What do you want? You should leave now. - I don't want to go. Can I stay? You can. Let's talk seriously. What's wrong with you? What can I say? - Who's following you? Why do you ask? I want to help you. You cannot help me. What? Why are you here then? You want to cure me. I don't need that. What can I do for you then? Nothing. Don't do anything. And what are you going to do? I don't know. I can't talk about that. Good Morning, doctor. - Good morning. There's a new ward. He's not one of ours. Keep an eye on him. He must not leave. Yes, sir. Don't worry. Hey, who are you looking for? Can you hear me? Who are you looking for? You can't come inside. It says on the gates that visiting hours are on Wednesday and Friday. Do you hear what I'm saying? What should I do? What? Calm down. Nothing can happen to you. You don't know. - I know. I've heard. Forget about it. - Forget? You must forget, Mihailo. You must listen to me. What if it happens again? - We'll talk about that later. Promise me now that you will listen to what I say. Have you ever thought that it could be a sickness? Tell me the truth. You think that I am crazy. You are a doctor? - Yes, I am. A man came to you. - Yes. He's still there? - Yes. He's a runaway patient. I'm his guardian. It's my duty to look after him. What are you asking from me? - To return him to me. I must tell you that he is seriously ill and needs to be cured. - I know everything about him. Trust me. You should not worry about his treatment. He needs a treatment that you can't provide to him. Nor can you. How can you help him? You treat mental patients. I'm preparing his transfer to a regular hospital. There's no need for that. I can provide everything that he needs. - You're very confident. If that's true, how did he manage to escape? That's none of your business. He doesn't want to go back to you. He's sick. He doesn't know what he wants. You can't keep him by force. And you can't take him by force. You're wrong. I can. Is that a threat? - I demand my rights. Mister, you should leave me alone. I warned you. Open so we can see. - The doctor forbids it. What's wrong with him? - I have no idea. Who is he? What is he doing here? How should I know? - A madman. Give us the keys so we can look for ourselves. If he's crazy, why don't they take him to a madhouse? We need peace. Guys, I have nothing to do with it. Nikola! Who's there? Where are you? Have you seen anyone? Where? It's a trap. Those words are a trap. Calm down. Please. You must not hesitate. And you? Who do you believe? Mihailo, don't make me regret that I've been honest with you. I'll do everything that I know and can, but you must help me. Let's have lunch together. Why do we waste time? Mihailo, do you trust me? You must do as I say. I'll take you to people who can help you. You know that you can't stay here forever. There's nothing else we can do for you. Doctor, let me ask you something. You won't go anywhere? - I'm here. And tonight? - I'll stay with you. Mihailo. It's time. You should get ready. You're doing a good thing. Promise me that you will get well. Mihailo, promise me. Can I take a break? You can. Take him away. Hey, your ward is dead. I know. You killed him. - Me? Hey you, stop! Wait! Come back!
