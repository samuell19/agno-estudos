"We admit that things can start before us..." "...but not end after us." Guido Morselli, DISSIPATIO H.G., 1973. I'm an electronic butler. - You look a bit run-down. - Here is your coffee. Drink some too, so that you recharge. - Good, good! - Sure, it's Red Quality Lavazza. More you drink better you feel. - More you drink better you feel. - How do I stop it? Natalina! Look how wonderful, the super lorry. The American concrete mixer made of 64 pieces you can dismantle and rebuild. - Look how it turns! - Look how fast it is! İt's beautiful and this is everything! With this convenient suitcase/box you can bring it to your friends or on holiday with you. The super lorry is so robust that you can climb in it. Come on, let's play with Isotta and the superlorry. IN 2016 THE DEMAND FOR OIL EXCEEDED 96 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY. FROM 20TH JULY 1920 THE PERMIAN BASIN, THAT GOES FROM TEXAS TO NEW MEXICO, PRODUCED MORE OIL THAN ANY OTHER OILFIELD IN THE UNITED STATES. A'PUMPJACK' REACHES 8,000 METRES OF DEPTH. MOUNT EVEREST IS 8,848 METRES HIGH. Sometimes... ...when I walk among the containers... ...I remember of the places in the world where I've been. Brown reminds me of the red soil in Victoria. Red is the women in Hong Kong. 95% OF THE WORLD TRANSPORT OF COMMONLY USED ARTICLES RELIES ON SHIPS A TRANSOCEANIC CARGO SHIP CAN REACH A 400 METRE LENGTH L'EMPIRE STATE BUILDING IS 381 METRE TALL. EACH DAY EMPIRE STATE BUILDING IS VISITED BY ABOUT 21,000 PEOPLE. Before I used to work as a mechanic on land. Then I studied marine engineering... ...because I saw my cousins sailing... ...and having a good life. Journeys, women, booze, fun. I began from scrap. I was a scullery boy on fish boat everywhere, Pacific, Atlantic... We were 14 on a tiny ship. I puked all the time and almost never ate. On those ships you go mad, it's impossible to live there... ...that's why I moved on to cargo ships. Savannah Jacksonville Baltimore Houston Portland. New Jersey. New York. Abidjan. Cotonou. Lomé. Luanda Johannesburg. All sailors go bitches. It's normal. At the time I was single. Danilo was a good playboy. In Bangkok if you don't let class c girls on the ship... ...at night they cut the moorings... ...and the next morning you wake up in the middle of the harbour. In Cape Town the girls came with some very good weed. In Odessa and Constanta Russian girls... ...were very experienced. The first thing you think is: "She is an angel." But then you find out that inside she is rotten. I'm happy they chose me for this this job... ...but then years go by... ...and even sailer yearn for a quiet life... ...some children... ...a home. Even sailors yearn for some stability. Together we decided that I'd work as much as possible... ...now that I'm strong... ...so that in five or six years... ...and we'll make our dream come true: A cottage made of wood... ...with a 12 acre park... ...and many chickens. She likes singing hymns... ...but I never liked them. I asked her to climb in a container to ask her to marry me. She said yes just because she was about to throw up. We sang together at the party. We were in a very green meadow. There was a carpet of white petals on the ground. We had a golden crown on the head. Every day we carry so many things... ...in every corner of the world... ...but we are nomads, we don't have anything with us. We must have at least one dream to chase... ...or everyday we go where we go... ...but it is as if weren't going anywhere. Washing machines. Treadmills to run on. Beds. Musical instruments. Pistachoes. Helicopters. Arm-chairs. Materasses. Tyres. - Champagne bottles. - Headphones. Computers. - Chairs. - Apples. - Bananas. - Sports gear. - Hams. - Tables. Paper. A lot of paper. Once we even carried a monkey. The monkey was sitting in one of the containers on the deck. You see, I cut myself with the bag. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to Bianca. Happy Birthday to you. IN THE ANECHOIC CHAMBER (WITHOUT ECHO) THE ACOUSTIC VALIDATION OF MOST EVERYDAY OBJECTS IS CARRIED OUT THE EXPERIENCE OF THE CHAMBER CAN CAUSE IN MAN A PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL UNBALANCE. IN THE PAST THE ANECHOIC CHAMBER WAS USED AS A TORTURE INSTRUMENT. My mother's name was Marina and she was a cello player. I remember my mother playing the cello... ...a reddish cello. I sat on a small chair for children... ...a 30 cm tall, plaited wicker chair. She was always very strict... ...strict is not the right word. She was afraid I hurt myself. My mother's fear I could hurt myself... ...has always pushed me to develop at my best... ...my mind potential... ...totally neglecting my body and looks. Now very easy things... ...like climbing three stairs... ...can be very difficult for me. But also I never developed... ...my poetic creativity. I don't know why. I always applied myself to numbers... ...since arithmetics, in primary school... ...to partial derivatives... ...and tensor calculus. I expressed my creativity... ...in maths formulas... ...but not in literature. Since my childhood, I have been used in not getting wrong... ...consecutio temporum or consecutio modorum. This might have caused me some problems. I have been told that... ...had I known less subjunctives... ...and slightly better everyday life, I might have been an advantage. If I remember well, I wasn't yet in primary school... ...when I expressed the wish... ...to get as a Christmas present... ...a small piano. Nobody at the time, not even my mother... ...would have thought that, after decades... ...I would be measuring the sound features... ...of pianos for children. For more than 35 years... ...I have been checking... ...the sound features of th most different objects. One of the strangest... ...was the sound made by a plastic box for sweets. I never went on Facebook... ...although I exist on Facebook... ...but when I go there... ...I can't wait to get out since I don't find anything interisting. If a layperson, a person not in the scientific field... ...would enter an anechoic chamber, they would feel uneasy... ...as it could remind them of a coffin. If you don't have hope at home... ...if you don't have God... ...if you don't have a reason to sail... ...you are left only with the folly of silence. Silence is like the alpha and omega, the life cycle. Sound, the interaction of frequencies generate happiness... ...which is a time continuous periodic function. In silence, look for your sound... ...let go of the sound of useless things. Natural harmonics, artificial harmonics... ...consonances, dissonances, returned the territory of the soul. But in silence one can also find a sense of great freedom. Remember, very pious Virgin Mary... ...that someone who asked for your help and was abandoned... ...is unheard of. Please don't, Mother of the Verb, don't despise my prayers, but listen to me with a benevolent attitude and make them true. Amen. If I close my eyes I feel: 4000 chickens... ...20 pigs... ...10 cows... ...waves from the window of a cottage made of woo... ...with solar panels... ...vegetables from the garden cooking in a pan... ...water from the well coming out from the well... ...two rocking chairs... ...the gurgling of very sweet coffee... ...6 acres of silence. We feed the oven every 15 minutes. Bye bye to eveyone. In those 15 minutes, in the rubbish ditch there is a deafening silence. It's like being in a great tomb. If I close my eyes... ...I hear: ...A light whistling in my ears... ...my breath... ...the beat of the cardiac muscle, the heart... ...the rumbling of the stomach... ...the blood flowing in the arteries. The absence of outside sounds helps concentration... ...looking inside yourself. One is more keen on meditating on oneself, on the soul. Sound makes us forget of ourself... ...sound covers fear. The origin of life is in silence... ...and in silence life ends. We must keep living in this world. Although this world is huge chaos. And it's nine years... ...I have been working in this place to improve it. In the plant there are more than a thousand alams. Every valve... ...engine... ...pump... ...thermic drill... ...if there are problems... ...sounds in the silence. Ditch alarms... ...fire alarms, infrared chamber alarms... ...alarms from the gantry position... ...the fire siren... ...spider movement warning, alarms for the failure of every engine... ...electric feed alarm... ...alarms for the candle filters for the ash washing, alarms for the pumps... ...control valves. ASH IN HIS LIFE A EUROPEAN CITIZEN PRODUCES 13,000 BAGS OF RUBBISH 500 KG PER YEAR. A WAST TO ENERGY PLANT, BURNING EACH YEAR 180,000 TONS OF RUBBISH PRODUCES ENERGY FOR 20,000 PEOPLE, HEAT FOR 3,000 FAMILIES AND 30,000 TONS OF WASTE. For 15 years... ...I supplied Switzerland with games for adults. 15 years of my life sacrificed to slot machines. Super shary 20. Super action. Super shary 400. Super shary 1000. Admiral with fruit. Jocker. Black jack. Pokers with poker reels. Royal poker. Photo play. Machines with stuffed animals. In a business with two machines one could earn up to 14,000 € per months in coins. They were... ...in the bars... ...in the butcher's shops... ...in the chemist's... ...in cultural associations... ...in private garages... ...in brothels obviously. I made a load of money... ...but God never wanted me to earn so much. Life is all a matter of chance. The next day you find yourself mowing grass... ...on a hill... ...with to kids playing next to you. You see valleys filling up with rubbish and you decide to take another road. I make things that people don't want disappear... ...and I do it in the cleanest way possible. Today I am invisible... ...in the silence... ...far from all that racket. In a cathedral... ...of cement and technology. Each of us must burn their own shit. Certainly it will never smell good. I work so that that smoke can be clean and white... ...so that stinky shit can have some use. I work so that it is buries as less as possible in our valleys. O almost never say what I do. I just do it and feel very good. After half an hour in the ditch you are gasping... ...after an hour you are almost not breathing, the smell is unbearable. You must walk very slowly looking around... ...you must cut hanging cables... to avoid they cut your head while you are cleaning. When you hear a high pitched signal, that the grinder is starting to work. If you hear it twice it means the spider is coming towards you. In the ditch and in the oven hoppers I found everything.
