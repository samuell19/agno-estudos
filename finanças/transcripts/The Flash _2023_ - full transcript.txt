- Have a brilliant day. - Yeah, thank you. You too. Morning. What can I get you? - Where's curly-hair lady? - Sara? She's out sick. Or at least, - that's what she says. - Oh. She's got a new boyfriend. What can I get you? Usually it's my usual and she usually has it ready because I'm usually late. Well, don't keep me in suspense. Um, it's a PB and BRHC on a roll. Okay, so... - "PB" would be peanut butter, I'm assuming? - Yes. "BR," bananas, raisins. "H," honey. "C," cheese on a roll. Aren't you blessed with a fast metabolism. Are you running a marathon or something? You know, my sister ran a marathon once, God rest her soul. She's not dead. She's just exhausted. We get it, Sharon. You ran. But everyone has to work in the morning. Yeah, I have to go to work, three minutes ago. And, sorry, I'm in sort of a rush for the sandwich. You can't rush a good sandwich, dude. Alfred, really can't talk. Good morning, Mr. Allen. No, I'm late. And I'm starving, and curly-haired girl isn't here and her name is Sara, and she has a boyfriend. We have a situation at Gotham General. A robbery gone wrong. This is the middle of the morning. Why is our bat-friend even awake? Call Superman. That was my first thought. Sadly, he's otherwise engaged. - active volcano in Central America. - Classic. What about Diana? My other first thought. Rather annoyingly, she's not picking up. How many first thoughts, exactly, did you have before you first thought of me? ...never about her. - This is about you. - Hi, sorry. Is my sandwich... I learned my lesson on the boat last year. Stuff my sister comes out with when she's drunk. Personal comments about my mom's friends as well, which I think is what I say about her... Oh, my God! Flash! - Hi. Thank you. - I love you. - You seem very nice also. - Oh, my God! - No way! - I think I'm gonna die! Patching you into Mr. Wayne. No, please don't. Oh, my God. Sorry if this sounds weird, but are you actively eating that candy bar? Maybe you could throw it to me? - In the name of justice. - Yes, yes. I need you here now, Barry. Hi, Bruce. Yes, I'm... coming. No! No, no! Bruce, this is a huge mess. Why aren't you here? Bruce, why does it sound like you're fleeing the scene? Falcone's idiot kid decided to try to play in the big leagues. He put a crew together and broke into the lab at Gotham General. Stole a highly deadly virus. I intercepted them, but they blasted their way out. You can handle the hospital, Barry. Somebody has to save the rest of the world, so I was gonna do that. If you don't mind. Sounds about right, Bruce. "Thanks for saving me from the sinkhole, Flash." Barry, gas and water pipes ruptured. In the basement. Right. On it. Can you open it? - I think it's locked. - It's jammed. God, it's not working! Oh, please! Look, Alfred. I've come to accept that I'm essentially the janitor of the Justice League. Which sucks. But I've come to accept it. But... I can't help but notice... that it always seems to be a bat-mess... that I'm cleaning up. - Right this way. Eyes forward. - Yes. - Stay together, now. - Yeah, I know, right? Look out! - Wow. Whoa. - What? If my calculations are correct, and history will prove they usually are, the foundational damage is about to cause the collapse of the east wing. - East wing's fine. - All right, I got you. Which is good because my speed is lagging. Running on empty, Alfred. Do you hear that? That's my stomach. No, no. It's the collapsing east wing. Barry, 30th floor. There's a baby... Shower. Oh! Oh! Mr. Allen, you've made me very proud. And a lot of mothers very happy. Oh! Yeah. Okay. I understand that these events can be psychologically scarring. You should seek the services of a mental health professional. The Justice League is not very good at that part yet. Trust me. God. Shake him off! If that briefcase falls into the water, it could wipe out half of Gotham by lunchtime. - Damn it. - Please don't drop me. Oh, God, no. Please, please don't. No! Sorry I'm late. Watch your step. - Hi. - Hey. Nice suit. Looking good, Flash. Oh, uh... Thank... Uh... And you... are welcome. My ego's far too big to say "thank you" to someone else. Hmm. I developed this... all-powerful persona to compensate for my childhood trauma... I, too, have childhood trauma. Batman seems crazy. -The Lasso of Truth... -Billion dollar. She's the mother... never gets old. I'd do a lot better just giving all my money away. Yes, if I really wanted to end crime, I should end poverty. I know sex exists. I've just never experienced it. Damn it. Well... I have to run. Yeah. Always a pleasure. The sex thing was a metaphor... for gothic literature. There was just no way to recover from that. Just let it go. Well, I'd really love to stay and clean up more mess... but this little superhero needs his breakfast. Goodbye, Flash. Yeah. Bye, Batman. Well done, Mr. Wayne. Will you be home for breakfast, sir? Yes, I think so. The road to destruction. This was never about her. This is about you. You have to stop living in the past. Now, was that fast enough for you? Morning, professor... Ah, look who's here. Shut up, Albert. Every day. I don't know how you do it, Barry. What'd you, like, crawl here, bro? - Is he mad? - Well, you're getting fired. - You're getting murdered. - Oh, no, no, no. Let me guess. Your alarm clock didn't go off. - No... - Oh, your dog ate your alarm clock. Your alarm clock ate your keys. Your keys' grandmother died, and they need a personal day. - It was none of those things. - What was it this time, Barry? It was, um, something else that was far less outlandish. And I know I missed the meeting... but I'd still really like to present these case files for potential review. I think we rushed these cases. - We need to reopen them. - Oh! Rushed? We got a backlog six months deep, and you want us to move slower? You need to focus your motion. Do the work, close the case, move on. You have a lot of potential, Barry. You shouldn't still be getting me coffee after all these years. You're right. That's... That's true. Go get me a coffee. - Two sugars? Yeah. - Oh, yeah. You're gonna love this. I'm very satisfied with the ruling in the Johnson case. The evidence our lab analyzed... was more than sufficient to be conclusive. - I'm still working that evidence. - Because of the diligence and hard work and focus... Barry was still working on that evidence. Think if it were up to you that we'd still be scraping Ted Bundy's molars. You know what? I'm so happy you find this all so hilarious, but we are dealing with real people's lives, people's families. And I don't think you can grasp the gravity of that. So, why don't you leave me alone? - Barry Allen? - Iris West. You... know my full name also. Yes, from school. Aw, Barry, you didn't tell us you had a friend from school. - We actually didn't know that Barry had a friend. - Wow. Yeah, what does that make it now? - One? - One. You guys are so... Um, bye, you guys. Okay. Oh, my God. That was just... Um... They're not really my friends. They're my work friends. Do you work here? Yes, I do. God, it's been a long time, huh? Hmm. I feel like we saw each other... like a few years ago, right? No, because... we haven't seen each other since... college. Ah. Maybe I was just thinking about you. Well, I'm really glad I ran into you. - Yeah. - Yeah. Your father's appeal is tomorrow, right? Yeah. How... Sorry, how do you know about that? I'm covering it for the paper. Oh. How is he holding up? Um... Are you asking for the paper? - No, I'm asking as a friend. - Oh. Although I'm sure the public would want to know as well. Well... my only official comment is that my dad is innocent. Right. I mean, no one... would want to believe that their father killed their mother. What do you mean, "believe"? My dad shouldn't be in jail. My mom should be alive. It's not about what I believe. - It's about what the truth is. - Right. No, yes, that's... Oh, my God. That's what I meant. Right. Sorry, I have no official comment at this time. You have a collect call from the Iron Heights Penitentiary. - Do you wish to accept? - Yes. - Hey, Dad. - Hey, Barry. - How ya doing? - I'm fine. - You getting out much? - Yeah. Well, no. Uh, no. But I, um, I ran into an old college friend... Iris West, today. Didn't you have a monster crush on her? Well, she have a boyfriend? - Why don't you ask her out? - Dad, I, um... I had a friend run the old security camera footage from the store... through this new program he's developed. And it's crystal clear now. It's just... you never look up, Dad. You can't see your face. So, without new evidence to support your alibi... we're just gonna need to start thinking about the next appeal. No, uh-uh. You need to stop worrying about your old man. Do that, you might actually have time for a girlfriend. But Dad, I don't want... We've done this before. This was a last-ditch effort... and we'll go through the motions tomorrow. I'm okay, really. You know, sometimes I even think it's probably easier for me to be in here than out there... without her. 'Cause this way, I can imagine she's alive... out there living her life. Barry? Barry? You there? Yeah, I'm here, Dad. Hey, remember that sauce she'd make on Sundays? The whole house would smell like basil, tomatoes. And she'd put on my sweats and start singing. Yeah, what was that song? I loved that song. Remember that part. It's not fair. What's not fair, Monkey? This question is stupid. How many calculations can you think of with an answer of 24? There are a bajillion answers. How am I supposed to fit them all? You are right. There are a bajillion answers to this question. Not every problem has a solution. Sometimes you just have to let go. Give your brain a rest and help me make the pasta. Come on. No. Henry? I need you to do me a favor. - I don't do favors. - Okay. Barry needs you to do him a favor. Oh, Barry! Yeah, anything. I need another can of tomatoes. You have a can of tomatoes. I need another one. I thought you guys went to the store this morning. But I forgot the tomatoes. This looks way more fun. Let's just let Barry go to the store. You drive, right, Squirm? - What? No. - Getting so big. You can do anything. Look at ya. You're getting gray, actually. - Green can, not the blue one, okay? - Got it. Blue can, not the green one, right? - No! Green can, not the blue one. - What? Oh, God. She's gonna start singing. Run! Run, Barry! I love you, Monkey. I love you more. I loved you first. Nora? Barry! Barry! Barry! Call 911 now! Barry? Barry? Don't worry about tomorrow. We always knew it was a long shot... Dad? Your call with Iron Heights Penitentiary has been terminated. Barry Allen? ...evidence our lab... You need to focus your motion. Do the work... She promised... Now, was that fast enough for you? So, you're saying you went back in time? - Mm-hmm. - Like in Pozharnov? Yeah, like in Pozharnov, except, but Pozharnov was a second. This time I went back a whole day. So, let's imagine... that it is, in fact, possible for you to run... faster than the speed of light... and in so doing, travel back in time. It still would be... wildly irresponsible. I knew you were gonna say this. Yes, because, Barry, if you were to go into the past, any interaction you have with your parents or yourself, you step on the wrong blade of grass, you have no idea what the consequences to that could be. No, I know. The butterfly effect, right? - Yes. - I get it. But Bruce... I could fix things. You could also destroy everything. I could save her. I could save both of them. I... I could save your parents. Barry, these scars we have... make us who we are. We're not meant to go back and fix them. And there's nothing broken with you that needs to be fixed. Take it from an old guy who's made a lot of mistakes. Don't live your past. Live your life. Don't let your tragedy define you. What if it's supposed to define me? Your tragedy made you a hero. And also made me alone. We could hang out. I mean, do you wanna get a bite? Like, I'm still hungry. Not this time. Maybe some other time. Yeah. Nice ride. You have fancy friends. Yeah, it was an Uber. Exec. Look, Iris, I really can't talk about the case at all. I'm not here as a reporter. Can we talk? Come on in. I'm not gonna lie. It's a lot tidier in here than I expected. - Yeah? Yeah, well, um... - Yeah. I'm a pretty tidy person. - Can I offer you a drink? - Sure. I'll take a beer. Hmm. Beers, beers, beers. I keep 'em in my fridge. Thanks. Sure. Look, I feel really bad about earlier. I should've been more sensitive. And, um, I probably could've been less sensitive. I mean, I can't imagine what you've been through. It's like you lost both parents in one day. I did. I lost my mom to a tragedy, and I lost my dad to the failures of the justice system. Is that why you got into criminal forensics? To try and fix the system? Yeah. Yeah, to fix it. There's gotta be a way to fix it, right? I mean, that's kinda why I got into journalism, too. I could make it right if I could just go back somehow and warn them without them knowing that I'd warned them. I... thinking like that's gonna... drive you crazy. "If I could just go back in time... and stop the guy who did it." It's... No, I can't do that, 'cause that's way too much interaction. My dad wasn't even at home. My mom sent him to go get a can of tomatoes. I think whoever broke into the house thought it was empty. And then my mom was in there with the knife in her hand and things went bad, just this absurd chain of events. And it's like, this footage should've finally supported my dad's alibi. But instead... three lives ruined for a can of tomatoes. Oh, my God. What? Well, that could be it. If my mom doesn't forget the tomatoes in the first place, then he never leaves and she never dies. No one would even have to see me. Bruce said no interaction. This is no interaction. This is just quick in, quick out, back to the present, like I was never even there. That's how I fix it. Oh, my God, Iris. - Hmm? - Thank you, so much. - This has been great. - Oh. Um... I'm sorry. I... I have to leave. Okay. Right. Uh... I had a really great time, by the way. We should do this again. Kal-El, son of Krypton. This is a bad idea. So, you're fast. Your dad's a murderer. Your dad's a murderer. Call 911 now! Now! Now! Now! Hi, Mom. Don't forget the tomatoes. See you soon. Please work. Happy Birthday, Barry. - Go, Barry, hurry up. - Go! Congratulations to the class of 2013! I love you so much. Monkey! What are you wearing? Is that Barry? And he's early? What universe is this? You've cut your hair. Now you can see your eyes. - You look terrible. - Henry! - You look old. - You look beautiful, baby. What are they doing to you over there? Leave him alone. He's perfect. Come here. I love you so much. I love you, too. I love you more. I loved you first. Go take a shower and change. You smell like a boot. Go, go, go. "Old," seriously? Well, no, I mean like mature. He's at that age, he wants to look old. He, you know, gets into bars that way. How can I help? Mm. Hey, Mom, how was your day? How was your month, or your last 18 years? Or that's a weird question... 'cause I was here. But obviously, we share those memories together. Or I don't know, maybe we could make some new memories. Like we could go to the aquarium, or the circus, or to the park and you could push me on a swing. That's also weird because I'm an adult now, so I'd probably motivate my own motion on a swing. So, how was it this week? How's school? At school was... is good. - Mm. - School's been great. I've just been working really hard there on my... studies. Did you ask out that girl from econ? I know freshman year is about going out, meeting people, okay? Exploring things. Experimenting. But you have to be very careful. Oh, shit. I... have to shit. Outside. Help! Shh! Why are you here? What year is it? - No, no, no. - Help! That's my face. You stole my face. Think I'm having a mushroom flashback? - Is that a thing? - How old are you? Eighteen. Whoa. This is mad trippy. So, we're, like, in the future. No, wait. This is not trippy, dude. This is catastrophic. And no, we're not in the future. I was supposed to be back in the present, but I'm still in the past. And there's not supposed to be two of me. You and I are not supposed to be occupying the same reality at all, let alone interacting. I just can't believe I'm a superhero who time travels... No, no, no. You are not anything. Which is good. You don't want to be a superhero. It's scary. And I get bug splatter in my teeth all the time. Awesome. Hey, do the thing again. No, we don't have time. - Mom! - Shh! What are you doing? You're gonna tattle now? - Do the thing. - Fine. - Yeah. Yeah. - Happy? Now undo it. I can't, I can't. Ow. Barry, are you okay up there? We're fine! I'm fine! Okay, Monkey. So, do you have like a plane that goes underwater? Or like a boat that can fly? How old are you, like 40? Okay, you don't stop talking. It's not charming. It's abrasive and exhausting. And, oh, my God. I am starting to realize what people mean. Just... do me a favor and promise me that meeting me isn't gonna screw up space-time. Broski... I got you. Shit, I'm in so much trouble. What do you mean? What do I do? I could drug you. Yeah, I could drug you, and then you'd pass out, you'd wake up and you'd forget that anything ever happened. And it wouldn't be wrong, right? Because you're me. No! I mean, we shouldn't. - Please don't... drug me. - No. No. Because here's the thing, and I thought about it before. I don't want to be drugged. But I'm sure we can think of another way. Let's put on our Barry thinking caps and think of a different solution for memory loss. Also, I'm a green belt... in the capoeira, and I have extensively studied wrestler, and I could just go frickin' lunatic on you. Besides, I have a date tonight... Okay. How hard do you have to hit someone to make them forget stuff? If I hit you in the past, will it hurt me in the future? Wait. You say you have a date tonight? Yeah. Wait, what were you doing? Uh, nothing. Who's your date with? This super babe in my econ class. - Iris West? - Oh, my God! Do we marry her? You're going on a date with her tonight? That's why I need Mom to do my laundry. You don't even do your own laundry? Do you? Okay. - I'm actually gonna go. - What do you mean? Enjoy your life. Do you. Change literally nothing. - Um, I'll see you again never. - I have a few more questions, though. We have so much to learn from each other. Oh, great. Well, you're leaving me. And now the storm's gonna ruin my date. What day is it today? Uh... Uh... Sunday? No, the date. It's September 29th. Shit. This storm, this is the day. - What day? - The day I got my powers. The day you get your powers. - Powers? - Listen... I can't tell you why I traveled back in time, and I can't tell you what I changed. But, essentially, in my version of reality, I ended up interning at the Central City Crime Lab in my freshman year, and that's where it happened. Well, happens. Tonight, September 29, the accident that gives me my powers. And if you're not there... in 30 minutes... then you won't get the powers. Which means I don't get the powers, maybe? And then, that would mean that I lose my way of getting back in time in the first place, and then I literally have no idea what happens. Powers? Wait, but what about our date tonight? She might be our future wife. There might not be a future... if you don't come with me... right now. Eight minutes. How are we gonna to get inside? What are you doing? Would you stop whining? This is gonna feel kinda weird. We walk through the door. Yes, it's okay. It's called phasing. Come on. I love phasing. Uh-huh. Everybody moves. Well... this is it. This is where I was sitting. And actually, let me take this for you. Thank you. Okay, I had just opened those windows... to clear out the fumes. Right around now. And I was sitting in that chair, and I was right under this shelf of chemicals. And that's when the lightning hits. Wait. - I get hit by lightning? - No, no, no. You don't get hit by lightning. Okay, 'cause for a second I thought you said... The lightning hits the chemicals... which then you get bathed in, - and that's what electrocutes you. - Okay, - but I don't want to be electrocuted, though. - Sit down. - No, you sit down. - I already have the powers! You already have the powers! Exactly! I am not getting struck by lightning! It worked. It looks like you lost a tooth. Oh. - No? - You lost a tooth. All right. We gotta go. What have we got? The alarms in the sterile lab. Go check it. Securing the entrance. We've gotta phase. Phase, phasing. Oh... Shit! I'm slow. Oh. Oh. Why is your place so much nicer - than I expected it to be? - You like it? Mom had to help decorate. You know Mom. Right, yeah. Classic Mom. Classic Mom. Hmm. - What a day. - Barry, the accident gave you powers, but took mine away. So, I don't know how I get back. Without access to the Speed Force, I don't know how I ever leave. Do you understand what I'm saying? - I might be stuck. - Wait. I have powers now? Yeah, but... you... No, no, no. Holy speedballs. Okay, I know this is incredibly exciting, because I went through it. Speedy Gonzales! Yes, I've done it many times myself. You can't just start... Shit. Oh, my... Ahh! Okay, I'm leaving! Put your hands up. What did you do? Nothing. Why? Barry... I could've told you about the clothes. It's friction. You run too fast, and regular fabrics are gonna burn up. It's the same reason why you can't move people very far at hyperspeed. That broccoli looks rotten. Look, some things you can move. Like, you can move, for instance, a microwave. But you can't move something like, say... - a baby. - Barry, it's like I've never eaten anything before. Everything has this vivid flavor. Try a little. Just take a little bite. That's bad, isn't it? Yeah, this is not good. No, I was kidding. I'm amazing. We're amazing. I'm so hungry. Hey, wait. I wanna try that phasing thing. How do I do that? You don't. Not yet. Okay? It's very complicated. Takes a long time to train your body to be able to speed up whilst your molecules slow down enough to pass through the molecular structure of solid objects... Get out of here! You've gotta start letting me finish my sentences. Are we always this sleepy? And hungry and naked? Well, the first two, yes. The third one, no. I've figured that part out. And honestly, if we're gonna do this there's a lot I'm gonna have to explain to you. So, a good place to start, I guess, is that, yeah, the original suit was actually made out of this polysynth... Or we'll pick this up tomorrow. So, the suit is inside the ring? - Yeah. - What? And I can have this? No, you can't have it. You can borrow it so you don't kill yourself using your powers. You're gonna push this button and the silk molecules are gonna uncoil, absorbing atmospheric gases and expanding the suit to full size. Ready? It was so tiny... You're supposed to put it on before it hits the floor. What, like change... right here in front of you? There's no one even here anyway, Barry. Come on... - Whoo, man. - Tight. It hurts. You know where it hurts? - In my dick. - Okay. I know, I know, but I don't need to know. - Sorry, can we move on? - Mm-hmm. Here's what I'm thinking. If I can train you to move like I do, then we can re-create the Chronobowl. Chronobowl? In the Speed Force. Speed Force? -And then maybe we can find some way to get me back to the future. -Back to the Future. Yes! Eric Stoltz is chur boy in that movie. What an embodied performance. You mean Michael J. Fox? Back to the Future? - Yeah, in the movie Back to the Future? - Oh, my God! - What's going on? - I don't know. You need to take the suit off now. Thank God. ...reported seeing a mysterious object hovering above the Australian seaboard. - We've obtained footage from the sighting... - Zod. - and as you can see, the object... - "Zod"? - appears to be a flying ship of some sort. - What's a zod? According to US government officials, satellite data has confirmed the presence of a spacecraft. We'll be sure... My name is General Zod. I come from a world far from yours. For some time, your world - has sheltered one of my citizens. - No, no, no. - This can't be happening. - I request that you return this individual... - Not now. - To my custody. What's happening? For reasons unknown... Zod's looking for Superman. What's a superman? Superman is an alien who lives on Earth. I'm assuming still incognito. But, yeah, he's an alien, and he's very powerful, and he's just the best. And then Zod is an alien from the same planet, also very powerful, but he's just the worst. And Zod came here to find Clark. - Wait, who's Clark? - Clark is Superman. - Oh. Okay. - But then Zod also tried to terraform the planet with this World Engine thing, and Superman stopped him eventually, but not before Zod killed thousands of people. - Yeesh. - And at the time, there was nothing I could do, I've... Wait, you... You were there? Yeah, I had just gotten my powers. And I was still putting some finishing touches on my suit. This thing, Zod's World Engine, it started destroying Metropolis, so I just went there and I started trying to save people. Daddy? Listen to me! Run away! Run away! There was this kid, and I... I got him, but then... I couldn't get his dad. Daddy! It was all I could do, save that one kid. Only Superman could stop Zod. But not in time to save those people. And now it's about to happen again. But... if I can find the entire Justice League, Superman and the rest of the band... Right. Then maybe I can prevent the whole thing from ever even happening at all. - Um, give me your laptop. - Okay. What is that smell? Ugh. Could be anything. Honestly. Who's that? Oh. That's Gary. That's the smell. It's... Don't worry. He's breezy. We can do this. Uh, let's see, Victor Stone, Gotham City University. Oh, this is my roommate, Patty. Patty... is your roommate? And that's her boyfriend, Albert. What's up? Good morning. Oh, sorry. And, uh, guys... This is my cousin. Barry. Whoa. I'm starving. Okay. Victor Stone, Gotham City University. Yes. Here he is. Victor Stone, star quarterback for the Knight... Shit, okay. He's not Cyborg yet. Wonder Woman. Wonder Woman! Las Vegas residency. Illusions, juggling, and zebras. No. That is not Diana. - Aquaman. - Aquaman? Is that like a super mermaid? No, Albert, he's not a super mermaid. Okay? He's half Atlantean, half human with superhuman strength who can control marine life with his mind. So, like a super mermaid? No, Albert! That is what you described. We'll just try Arthur Curry... Maine... lighthouse. Here we are. Thomas Curry. That's his dad. Uh, phone. Hello. - Hello, Thomas Curry? - Yes. Could I speak to Arthur? Is Arthur around? You wanna speak to my dog? What? No, no. Um, sorry. Uh... - Is this Thomas Curry? - Yes. - And you work at a lighthouse? - Yes. Okay, and your wife is the queen of Atlantis? - Will you accept this rose? - Yes. Uh, no. Uh, right, but maybe, maybe... um, a fishlike woman washed into your life - at some point or another? - Very funny, asshole. Arthur Curry was never born. - What? - This is a disaster. I-I-I completely destroyed history. Like Eric Stoltz. Okay, why do you keep saying, "Eric Stoltz"? Eric Stoltz is Marty McFly. - What? - Time travel? Oh. We talking "BTTF"? Come on, who is this guy? Okay, yeah, no, I know. I've seen all of them and Eric Stoltz is not Marty McFly. Really? Then explain Marty McThigh here. I can't explain that to you, Gary. That's not your thigh. It's the wrong actor, and it's upside down. Is it? The point is that in Back to the Future Marty McFly is very famously played by Michael J. Fox. The guy from Footloose? No, that's Kevin Bacon! - Bacon. - Kevin Bacon's Maverick with the volleyball, the gay guys, and the planes? -Top Gun. - Top Gun, right? - No, no, no. I completely broke the universe. Marty McFly is Eric Stoltz. - Yes. - Thank you. I created a world with no metahumans. And now there's no one to defend us from Zod. Albert! There's no Cyborg. There's no Aquaman. There's no Wonder Woman. There's no Superman. There's no Batman. I'm Batman. What, you... What did you just say? I'm Batman. Batman exists? - Hundo p. - Yeah, dude. Nobody knows who he really is, - but he exists. - Right. Well, uh, we... my cousin Barry and I, have to go to that cousin's dinner. Now. But it was a pleasure to meet you all. - And Gary. - Barry. - Barry. - Gary. Barry! What, are you frickin' kidding me with this place? What is this, hell? It's open. - Look at all this cool shit! - Okay, Barry, don't touch anything in here. Hello? Bruce? Bruce, are you there? Oh, boy. Hey, I didn't know you painted. They're good. Bruce Wayne? Bruce? Hey, check this out. There's, like, bells connected to every room in this house. Hey, maybe we can find this Bruce guy... if we just ring all these bells, right? You don't understand how servant bells work? Those are all the bells. - You ring them from all the other places. - What? You don't have, like, Downton Abbeyin your universe? Downtown Abbey's? The chain of, like, family-style restaurants? They're like, it's like cheaper Bananabee's. Oh, you know what I'd really go for right now? Abbey's sizzlin' zucchini squares. Okay. You know what, man? I've had it with you. Who the hell are you? I'm the guy who lives here. We're looking for Bruce Wayne. You hungry? Following the broadcast earlier from General Zod. The individual they're searching for - is still at large. - So... The president has yet to respond to the broadcast from earlier, and other foreign leaders are said to be... you're the same person as him... - but from an alternate timeline. - Yes. In which... you and I are friends? Yeah, you're like probably my best friend. - Okay. - Well, but you're a bit... you're, uh... - chronologically different. - Older. That's what I can't understand. I traveled back in time from here to here. Yet somehow, everything's all changed back here. - Or like when you were born, so... - Well... time isn't linear. Right? Right. At some point you probably saw a movie that told you that if you went back and changed the past, you'd create a kind of a branched timeline, right? Like, look. New present - and new future. - Yeah. Well, time doesn't work like that. That's not how time works. When you go back and change the past you create a fulcrum. You put yourself on a whole nother strand of spaghetti. New future. New past. It's retrocausal. It goes both ways. Actually, it goes many ways. Maybe some other time. Okay, but in an ontological paradox model, there's not... What you did was you changed the future and you changed the past. If a person is stupid enough to mess with time... what you eventually end up with is this. The multiverse. Some strands run almost parallel. There will be inevitable intersections, and others that are just... wildly divergent. What it is... is a hot mess. It's a crapshoot. It's all just a crapshoot. What does the parmesan mean? The metaphor's over. It's just a garnish. And I'll tell ya something. A person would have to be an idiot to play craps with the space-time continuum. Yeah, an idiot. Here. Mm. Are you joking with the chewing noises right now? So, uh, you're the reason this Zod character is about to destroy the Earth? Maybe. There's a guy called Superman who can stop Zod? - Yeah, yeah. - And flies? Shoots lasers out of his eyes? Yes, he flies, and he shoots lasers out of his eyes. Yes. No one said "Superman"... that might be a little on the nose? - You call yourself Batman. - Yeah. I don't call myself Super Batman. Wait, he's Batman? What did you think we were doing here? I thought this was the cousin's dinner. He's... Bruce Wayne is Batman? Not really. Not so much anymore. You know... they don't really need me. Things have changed. Gotham's now one of the safest cities in the world. Well, I... I need you. We need you. In my timeline, Batman's our strategist, our leader. The world needs Superman. You're the best detective in the world. You're probably the only person who can help me find him. So, will you help us? Pass. Like pass the salt? Bruce? He doesn't want to help us... we're gonna use his bat shit. Bat shit? Yeah, his bat stuff, his bat things. Stand on that thing. Okay, remember when you phased through the floor? - Yeah. - So, I need you to do that again. Ow. What is this place? Dude! This place straight beeves! "Beeves"? Barry! I almost died in an abyss! 12,805 Clark Kents in the US. Is this what I think it is? Holy shit! I used to see this thing on the news when I was a kid! Okay, well... refine search. Date of birth. - Wasn't born. He arrived. - Oh! Oh, Barry, look! I'm busy. With what? Looking for unidentified objects entering Earth's atmosphere anywhere near Kansas in the last 50 years. He has a back door into NASA. 'Course he does. Yeah, but Barry, check this out. This bag laughs. Okay, can't you take anything seriously? Stop messing around. Dude, come on. Have you seen this place? It's amazing! Hello! Has the gravity of this not sunk in for you? Stop messing around, Barry. I won't say it again. Yeesh. Sorry, Mom. Shut up. Shut up. You have no idea how lucky you are. No idea! You take everything for granted. You don't even appreciate... You just walk around thinking that you're so funny and so cool. And it's embarrassing, because you're not any of those things! Hey, screw you, man! I've done nothing but everything you've asked. You made me get struck by lightning! I phased naked through the floor. And I terrified Mrs. Johannson. Now I'm probably gonna have to move. You won't even tell me why you're here. But will you at least tell me why you're being so mean to me... for no reason? You used Monkey as a dartboard! Wait, what? Forget it. The monkey? Wait... So, you're mad at me for playing with a toy? It's not a toy. Mom bought us that monkey. 'Cause she calls us Monkey. She gives us monkey stuff all the time. Right. Look... I'm sorry. I'm not very good with people. Even myself. Oh. Come on, dude. You're... You're not that bad. You can just be kind of a dick sometimes. But let's face it. I am pretty obnoxious. But I just get excited. Come on. This place is pretty cool, right? Yeah. All right, well, um... I'll let you work. I know you're there. You know what I'm stuck on? That thing you said, with the spaghetti. You said there were certain intersections that would always be inevitable. You had an Alfred. My Bruce has an Alfred. Different worlds, different times... yet there it is. Certain people, certain events, certain strands of spaghetti, drawn to each other like... like magnets. I've read all about temporal paradoxes and causal loops. But this is more than that. Inevitable intersections are something none of the theories could have anticipated 'cause, well, how do you explain that except for... fate? If you are listening, sorry about your parents. I'm just trying to save mine. There has to be a way. There is a way, Barry. Just keep trying. Keep trying, Barry. Found him. Barry, wake up. Clark's being held by a mercenary group in a Siberian black site. Get up, Barry. The goat's on fire. We're going to Russia. Sweet. Mm. Coffee. How are we gonna get to Russia? I'll help you get this Superman. Then, you're on your own. Oh! You're... You are, you're... Yeah. I'm Batman. So, what's the plan? We're just gonna, what, grab Superman and dip set before the block is hot? I don't know. Hey, you should ask him. - You ask him. - You should ask him. Yeah, I'm not gonna ask him. Why not? I thought Batman was supposed to be your friend. Not this one. Not this Batman. - We're here. - Activating hover mode. - Ejector seat on. - Ejector seat. Ejector seat. Okay, there are stages. You're strapped to your parachutes. Hey, where's yours? Whoo! This rips dicks! All clear. Let's move. Okay! Good. Everybody's fast now but me. - Why is it so cold? - It's the Arctic, Barry. - Where'd he go? - I don't know. Just follow the footprints. Superman would be down there for sure. Yeah. Okay. What did you do? I had to move you. But I just did it a little. This might hurt. Just let it out. Let's go. That's where you keep Superman. Like a big scrotum. He's gonna hack the Soviet security cyberscrotum with a flip phone? I tried all the combinations. Yes! Shit. Kal-El? It's not him. We've gotta go. Wait. We can't just leave her here. Look at her. I'll grab her. Just go! I got you. I'll handle this jabroni. What the... Barry! Somebody shot me! Time to dip set! You, you lead the way! - Go! - Not that way! Not that way! Oh, God! Cover! No! It's coming around. Hurry, hurry. No, no, no! This is bullshit! No! Come on. Let's go. You didn't tell me we could get shot! Why would you assume we couldn't? Oh, great! To die at the feet of a Sputnik. Oh, man! I need this knee! - Stay calm. It'll heal. - Come on. - How much do you weigh? - 180. Each. Plus her, 440. Hold on. Oh, great. They're here. They're over here, too. Smirnoff Ice. - Yes. Smirnoff Ice. - Hi. Stop them! -Yep. -Okay, they're serious. Barry, shut up. Yeah, okay. What's the play? Batman, what do we do? What now? Now... we try not to die. Oh, you guys should've seen that in slo-mo. Yeah, I'm just realizing that I didn't really think this through. There are good Kryptonians... and then there are very, very bad Kryptonians. And I was very confident that we were just gonna find Superman, and if we found Superman, then this would all be super simple. - Who are you? - Holy Funyuns. Hi. - I... I'm Barry. - We're Barry. We were trying to find Kal-El. But we found you instead. What do you want with Kal-El? We were trying to rescue him. Why? Because he's my friend. Do you... Do you know him? She looks mad. Get ready. She might do laser vision, or she might do, like, a freezy breath... - or she'll just start throwing crazy... - My name is Kara. Daughter of Zor-El. Kal-El was my cousin. - Right, and who's Kal-El again? - It's Superman. - No, 'cause you said that was Clark. - Who's Clark? Clark is his human name. Clark. He was an infant when we left. The last son of Krypton... I... I was sent to protect him. It looks like he never made it to Earth in this universe. Our pods, they must have separated. Wait, so you thought a baby was gonna protect us from this Zod guy? General Zod is here. He must have tracked my pod's signal. - I have to go. - Whoa, whoa, wait. Well, you need to recover your strength. Actually, Barry... take her to the roof and put her in the sun. Yeah. - Yeah. - Whatever, like if, I mean, you're solar powered. Good for you. I've been trying to... Oh, uh... We'll take that with us. Um, am I cool to... turn around? Are you dressed in a red cape? You're levitating? Is it always this loud? Is it loud? Are you, uh, good? Do you feel, um... strong yet, or... Yep, that seems, uh, seems strong. You know... old man Barry, down there, says if we don't stop Captain Zode, he'll kill thousands of people. Billions of people. Billions? Of your people. - They're good people. - Good people? We came to this planet looking for a safe place to live, and they put me in a cage. Yeah. A lot of humans are dicks. But then there's babies and ballerinas. And entertainment wrestlers. A lot of humans are worth saving. Maybe to you. But I'm not a human. I'm a Kryptonian. She's gone. I have to get my powers back. If I can re-create the accident that gave me my powers... maybe I can reconnect to the Speed Force... and maybe we'd stand a chance against Zod. Or kill yourself in the process. Tell me something. If you get your powers back, you can go anywhere. You can go to another timeline, another universe. Why do you wanna stay... and fight to save this one? Because this is the world where my mom lives. I went back in time to save her. I'm not gonna lose her again. The kid doesn't know, does he? How do you tell someone something like that? I lost my parents... but that pain... made me who I am. I'm not sure I know who I am without it, actually. I spent a lifetime... trying to right the wrongs of the past. As if putting on a cape and fighting crime would bring my parents back. You actually did it. So... I guess the plan is to douse yourself in industrial chemicals while electrocuting yourself? Yep. Want some help? Hell yeah. That would be incredibly useful. I've actually already borrowed some chemicals and your soldering iron, and I'm sitting in your bat-seat. Is that like a faux pas? Wilco, Lima, Zebra, be advised... Air Command to Bravo 601. Primary teams, please confirm your AORs. - Green teams ready to move. - Standing by! You bring me nothing? Hmm. I gave you a warning. Your failure to deliver the Kryptonian traitor is being taken as an act of war. - Fire, fire, fire! - We have contact, contact! Weapons hot! Weapons hot! Open fire! No. Air support now! I repeat, air support! Okay, when I throw the switch, the current should run up the wire and draw the lightning right to the kite. Here, put that on. It's heat and impact resistant. Should protect you a little. Right, but the point is for me to not be protected. Okay. You're gonna need to be out of the way. I will. Let's get electrocuted. This is going to work, right? Of course it's gonna work. Nothing we haven't done before. Besides, this time we have Batman. What could go wrong? Uh, for the record, I think this is insane. Get back. It's fine. It's fine. Just you and me again, Mr. Lightning. Do it! Wait, what? No! No, wait! Stop! Stop! Oh, God. Oh, God. Barry, no. Go again. But... Please. The circuit is fried. I've got you. Hey. Barry. You're okay. It's like last time, right? So, you gotta heal now. Look, look, look! It's working. It's working. Yeah, it's working. Yeah. Yeah, he's healing. He's healing. Oh, my God. He's okay. Dude, you scared the shit out of me. You're awake. How you feeling? Slow. Maybe this will help. Ooh... Ooh! Yes! Dude, come on! Irresistible! Man, feels good to be back. Yeah! And what are we wearing tonight? You like it? I-I made it myself out of that old Batsuit. But you know, I made it our colors and everything. Well, check this out! It's a bit more loose. It beeves. Dude... you really mean that? I mean, I don't... I don't know what it means, exactly, to beeve. But it seems like it's positive. What are you doing? You came back. I'm glad you're okay. I have to ask you something. When you found me in that hole that they put me in... and I wasn't Kal-El... why did you help me? Because you needed help. Do you know what this symbol stands for? - Supergirl? - It means hope, right? Hope, yeah. Does it mean hope? Krypton was a beautiful place. We are a people of hope, not war. I'm coming to you live from Metropolis, where minutes ago, the mysterious flying... Zod may be from Krypton, but he is not my people. So, you're saying... Yes. I will help you fight Zod. Yes! Interesting group. What did you say, uh... we were called again? We're the Justice League. No. - No? - Well, I mean, kinda. We are short one literal goddess... one friendly Terminator and super mermaid. And we could definitely use a Batman. Are you in? You wanna get nuts? Let's get nuts. In my world, Superman showed up right away when Zod called him out. So, as of now, we're in uncharted territory. What I do know is that Zod somehow controls the World Engines, which will be destroying much more than just Metropolis now with every passing second that we don't stop him. Barry, what are you doing? What? Our kids are gonna wanna see this. Your kids? Well, you know, like everybody's kids. I mean, the children of the world. They're gonna wanna see this. We're getting close. I'm gonna stay airborne and take out their sky power. And Barry, just so we're clear what that essentially equates to is you and me versus the entire Kryptonian army. Chill. We need to buy Kara enough time to take out Zod. Oh, and remember that your suit doesn't dissipate energy like mine so you need to take breaks, otherwise you're gonna build up too much charge. Wait, what? Dang it! Hold on! - Okay! - Hold on. The humans we came to protect? They don't know we're on their side. Zod. Kara Zor-El. We've been waiting for you. Go, go! Cover! - Drag him out, drag him! - You go! I'll cover! Okay, and the space giant... and Mistress Murder... - are our responsibility, too? - Hey, hey, hey. Don't think about them, okay? Calm down. We're just gonna start with those guys over there. And yeah, they're Kryptonian, and we won't be able to kill them, but we can slow them down for her. One at a time. Okay? I'm gonna disarm them, and then you'll engage. Punch 'em. Come on, Barbie. Let's go party? Okay, ow! Oh. Okay. It's okay. You're okay. Come on. Jesus, they're fast. Yes, but not as fast as us. Terraforming has begun. This world must die so that ours may live again. Oh, my God. We gotta go. We gotta go. Dan, Danny, go, go! Krypton is gone, Zod. Your uncle... Jor-El... hid the key to Krypton's rebirth inside a Kryptonian child. All the genetic material needed to start again coded inside the DNA, then sent to Earth in an escape pod. He's not here. You have failed. We found him. We intercepted his pod. But your cousin was not the one we needed. You are the one. Kara Zor-El. It is your blood... we must harvest. What did you do to Kal-El? Your sacrifice that will allow Krypton to live again. What did you do? The infant did not survive. Look, new plan. I'm gonna create a cyclonic diversion. And you're gonna just come in, hard. Feet first this time. Yes! Barry, did you see that? Be careful. You're accumulating too much charge. What if I just Emperor this guy? No, no, no! Barry, that was actually only half stupid! But if you're gonna do that and not die, you need to complete the circuit somehow. Try putting your hands together, like this. Oh, shit. - You're ready. - Let's go! I'm going after the big one. I've been hit. Bruce, do you copy? - Where's Kara? - You go find her. Bruce! Ejection mode failure. Ejection mode failure. Rest, Kara Zor-El. Going down. But I'm not going alone. No, no, no, Bruce! Bruce, eject! Bruce, just eject... No! Kara. Isn't supposed... Not supposed to happen... Kara's dead. They're both dead. But they don't have to be, right? 'Cause we can go back. - Like you did. - You're not fast enough yet. You sure? Barry! Barry, wait! Is this back enough? Yeah, I guess so. Listen, Barry, I... What? It's okay. We can fix this. You know what you're gonna change? I know what I'm gonna change. I'm going after the big one. Bruce, pull off. That gunship is shield-protected. Roger that. Bet he's not. Who? Space giant? Yes, yes, please take him out. Yes. No. Hey. It'll be okay. Not this time, kid. Maybe some other time. We can't bring you back, can we? You already did. You already did. Come on, Barry. Gotta get up. Come on. - Barry. - We go again. Barry. Let's just go. Barry, come on. Let's just go. Barry, there's no point. Barry! Phase! Okay, I have to pull it out. - I have to pull it out. - No, I'm okay. You have to phase again. Barry, phase again. I'm okay. I just should've stopped sooner. Ow! Again. Barry. Okay, can we please just take a minute? Sorry, dude. Yeah, bro, of course. That's the whole thing. We can take as much time as it takes. No, that's not what I mean. Hey! Okay, you good? Come on. I need you in there. Let's go. Barry, please, just listen to me! Where were you? What, you just stand here the whole time? Barry, this is an inevitable intersection. You have to stop. Barry! No, Barry, wait! Barry, listen. There's something I should tell you. I went back in time initially - because... - Yeah, because Mom died. How do you know? It doesn't matter. Does it? You know that I have to undo what I did. No. It's not a mistake. We can save her. And we can save them. No, we can't. This is what Bruce was talking about. Barry, this is inevitable. We can try a million times, and we're not gonna be able to fix this. No matter what we do... this world dies. Today. Look around. Look at the damage we're causing. Now we have to stop. Okay? Look, I was just doing my laundry. You're the one who came and told me that I'm a superhero. And now you're saying what? You don't want me to be? Well, guess what! It's too late! I am... the Flash. And I can save everyone. Nobody dies! Barry... not every problem has a solution. Not every problem has a solution. Sometimes we just have to let go. Sometimes you just have to let go. Let go of Mom? She'll always be alive, somewhere in time. Always. Just not for us. You're full of shit, dude. I'm going back. You're going back to kill Mom? No! You're staying! You stay, right here. Just give me one more time. Barry, stop! You, stop! Feel like we got off on the wrong foot. Let's start again. I'm the Flash. What's your name? I've lived... more than you can dream. Not an answer. Do you, like, rehearse that? Whoa. Get out of here, Barry! That scar, you... Oh, my God. So, you're... You are... Yes, I am... you. We are so close. I've got it almost figured out. How long have you been doing this? Time is inconsequential. Come on, Barry. Up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Superman! Purrfectly foolproof. Only the Joker would think of that. Please just look at what's happening. These worlds... they're colliding and collapsing. We did this. W-We're destroying the fabric of everything. You have to stop. It stops once I've fixed it! It's not entirely your fault, Barry. I pushed you out of the Chronobowl on that September 29 so you could start me on this path. Hmm? How do you like our endless paradox? I made you create me... and now you're the one... in my way. No matter how close I get to winning this fight... you go back and let Mom die. You're the inevitable intersection. And you do have to let go. What's he talking about? You're my hero. What did you do? Hey, hey. Don't worry. It's gonna heal. It's gonna heal. I just wanted to... You tell Mom I love her. Don't forget the tomatoes. I used to love that cereal when I was a kid. Yeah. My son goes nuts for it. They stop making it. Well, I know they were talking about discontinuing it. - Do I know you? - No, I'm not from around here. I was just visiting my mom. Maybe I know her. What's her name? She's the best... and kindest person in the world. You okay? Yeah, I'm just... I'm really gonna miss her. I know I'm just... a random lady in a store. But do you want a hug? Mm-hmm. Sure. - I'm sorry. - Oh, don't say that. Your mom must be grateful you came to visit her. She's very lucky to have you. I'm very lucky to have her. Ah! You have to tell her that. Moms like to hear these kind of things. Believe me. Love you, Mom. I love you more. I loved you first. Bye. Bye. I'm back. Shit! Court! original trial was initially... I'm so sorry. As I was saying... the same security camera footage, Exhibit F in the original trial, was initially considered useless, but has now been enhanced, using the latest tech from Wayne Enterprises. It confirms the alibi Mr. Allen has argued, and his son, Barry, has corroborated, since day one. Here. Right here, you can clearly see my client, Mr. Allen, reaching for a can of tomatoes on the top shelf. Mr. Allen, Mr. Allen, can you tell us a bit more about what happened, please? Well, um... the tomatoes moved from the bottom shelf to the top shelf, and subsequently, uncooked the spaghetti. Unquote. I'm sorry, that makes absolutely no sense. What are you talking about, sir? - Thank you. Thank you so much. - The allegations, the trial... We're good here. Thank you. statement in the court. - Did I give a good quote? - Yeah. Spaghetti. Hey, speaking of food, I was thinking, um... you should ask me to dinner. D-Dinner with me? Yes, a date, Barry. Iris West, do you wanna dinner-date me? - I'd love to. - Thank you. I'd love to also. Call me. - Bruce! - Congratulations. Thank you. You have no idea how good it is to hear your voice. I... I have so much to tell you the next time I see you, Bruce. You were right. Okay? And I didn't listen. And things did get very, very weird, but I put everything back, I promise. I'm pulling up now. Oh, great. - Get the shot. - Sir, sir! - Back up, please. - Shot! Sir, I'd like to ask you for a video for the Daily Planet. - Wayne! Wayne! - Step aside. Was it backed by your own allegation? Who the fuck is this? He's not answering any questions. Hey, Barry. No, wh-where's... You're, you... No. You can't... You... You're not Batman. What's wrong with you? Huh. Well... I've told you it's my metabolism, right? I can't get drunk. I can't get drink either. Listen. Listen, I'm, 'cause I'm trying to... No, no, no. 'Cause what I'm trying to explain as simply as I possibly can, I promise... They were all Batman. They were all Bruce Wayne. But each of them was a completely different person. - So, on the other line-time... - Timeline. I'm the same guy? Yeah. Actually, pretty much. You're lovable, furry... loyal, motivated by bacon. All right, listen. Thank you for making it more simpler for me, Mr. Simple More. Yeah, I'm doing my best.- - Look, you're missing the larger premise here. In my timeline, when I... All right, come on. Up, up, Broseidon. All right, come on. I thought you were gonna sleep on the couch. Arthur, I live right here. Harry? I live right here. It's okay. Okay. Oh, hey. More beer. Go fast. Oh, here! Here. Here. Pay with this. Arthur, this is Atlantean treasure. You... You tell them that. -Yep. You're a sailor. He's fine.
