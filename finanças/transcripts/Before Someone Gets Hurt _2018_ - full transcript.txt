No! No! Aah! Did you hear that? What was that? I definitely heard that. Are we up there? No one is supposed to be up there. Gary? Go for Gary. Is there anyone walking above us, or walking on the staircase? Uh... I got no movement. I got no one above you. Hold on. Hey, Tim? - Go for Tim. - Location check. Third floor. Client's bedroom. Nothing here. We're about to enter the east hallway. The girls reported something above them. I can't verify. You want to take a look? On it. So, what we do is look for logical explanations. When we checked the door and the floorboards, if you notice the blackout screen in front of your window, the window, which was open, down the hall... the bathroom window is also open. It's a cross breeze. Door slammed shut on its own. The house has rectangular duct work attached to your forced air heating system. Now, you see that square piece? So, when it heats up it expands, causing it to flex. And sometimes the duct work will flex in a row, similar to dominoes, but with sound. Hence, ducts are expanding. No ghost? - No ghost. - This time. Okay? We good? - Yeah. - Great. Okay, let's cut it. Whoa! Okay, pump the brakes. I'm the only one who says cut. No. But, okay, what else do you want? Something pithier. I heard elephant pith is a natural shampoo. And you need to start being on time. Thank you so much, Bruce and Linda. I hope you feel better about living in your home. You won't make us look like complete idiots on TV? No, no, God, of course not. I would've been scared too with what was going on in your house. But luckily you dodged a bullet, and it's nothing. Well, thank you. Thank you. All right, we'll talk to you soon. Safe home. Bye-bye now. All right, I have an announcement to make, and it's not a done deal yet, but we are in negotiations with SYFY. - No way. - Get out! Really? Bullshit. Yeah, so, if it's not too much to ask, please do what I say. If I ask for a little more epigrammatic... That's another word for "elephant pith." ...just indulge me, that is, if you want to get off the Internet and onto national television. Yeah? Okay, so they want more behind-the-scenes stuff, so cameras on all the time. Let's go, I want to go over what we have for our next shoot. Hey, check out this address. It's 311 Lenox Ave., Edgemont Hills, New York. Whoa, looks like in the last 300 years there have been 14 unsolved murders at this address. Neighbors swear that the place is haunted, and it is currently vacant. That's it. Lisa, get us in 311 Lenox Ave. in Edgemont Hills. The usual, three days. Billy, go up early and set up cable and audio. Stacy, Lisa, I want you to research, find out everything you can about the history of this place. All right, let's go. - What? - Can you define early? Hey, James. Hey, Jamie. - Yeah? - Can you help me out with this? - With what? - I think I broke something. I don't know, I think there's, like, a short here? - What'd you do with it? - It's like right there. Ah! What the heck, man? Electrocution is funny. - You don't get to do that. - It was a joke. - I'll buy him another coffee. - That's not the point. You got to stop screwing around, it's not cute anymore. - You do that stuff all the time. - Grow up. You know, it's funny, I thought older brothers were supposed to be supportive, but you never got that memo, did you? It's okay, though. I forgive you, I forgive you. From now on I'll be a team player. No more shenanigans, no more pot. The house shakes... it was a good talk. Ah, baby steps. Okay. Oh! Shit. Ah, here we go. All the way. Going to the house, doing all the things. Happy birthday, baby. It's my birthday. Right, and what greater gift could I give you? Wow, so, so benevolent of you. Nothing could ever change now. - Okay, resume. - Okay. Oh... wait, wait, let me check. - We got to go. - All right. Is this the, um, permit place? What kind of permit? I'm with a show. I'm with Ghost Investigations. We have a permit. Waiting. It's not ready yet. Okay, um... do you guys have a john? And I don't mean a corporate closeted married guy looking for a cheap BJ, you know? I don't sell my body anymore. Not since I found the Lord, our savior, Jesus Christ. That way. Thank you. Okay. Hey, all right. Here we go. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's a nice touch. You're talented. Right next to the portrait of the fake flowers. Will somebody call him, please? Will you relax? He's coming. See? There he is. Hey, guys. Sorry. Glad you could join us. Wait. Damn it, I forgot something. - Seriously? - I'll be right back. - Oh, my God! - Oh! Oh! Oh, my God. Someone call 911. Are you serious? Dude, I had you. - No, you didn't, okay? - Not even a little bit? Not even a little bit. Hey, you have no credibility for giving your brother shit - if you're going to fuck around. - I told you I'm good. - Get... no, get off me. - Kiss it, make it better. Ew, yuck! I can't. No. - Here, have a hand job. Go. - Thank you. Finally. Ready? We're on our way to 311 Lenox Avenue. There have been 14 unexplained deaths there. Wait a second, I'm just going to make a... And action. Okay, we're on our way to 311 Lenox Avenue. There have been 14 unexplained deaths there... - Murders. - Murders there, since 1692. And seven different structures have stood on the plot, including a church originally. I'm going to get some B roll - of driving real quick. - Okay, great, great, yeah. Okay, here's B roll of driving. Oh, two bathrooms. Fucking fancy. Master bedroom. Master. So, 46 Hightown Road, did you say? Forty four. Forty four, right. - Greenburg. - Greenburg. Excuse me? Hi. We're producers of the show Ghost Investigations. We're here about a filming permit for 311 Lenox, in Edgemont Hills. Our colleague was here earlier and he said the permit wasn't ready yet. The gentleman in the baseball cap? And you all would like to film your... your little television program up at 311 Lenox? - Yeah. - Yup. Yeah, you shouldn't go to that house. - It's creepy. - Right. Like creepy, like the music plays even though the power's been turned off, and the lights are turning on and off, that sort of thing? No, like people being chopped up in itsy-bitsy pieces and reassembled on the wall in the shape of a cross kind of creepy. Have a good film shoot. Hello? Jamie, real original. Jamie? Dude, if you've been here this whole time while I've been setting up, that is not cool. So, who's the guy who texted you about the house? I can't reveal my sources. Okay, that's cute. But seriously, who? A ghost. - Stacy. - David Ellington. Okay, who's David Ellington? What's with all the questions? Why are you being so secretive? I'm not. We may want to interview him. Who is he? He doesn't want to be interviewed. - Why, what did he say? - Who the hell is he? David Ellington, he took over ownership of the property in 1992, when the last murder occurred, and it's been vacant ever since. Well, why did he text you? Oh, I don't know, baby. Maybe because I'm a producer on a hit Internet show about haunted houses, and he has a haunted house. Work on him. I want him on camera. All right, I'll get his address. Wow, they found them all... - What? - ...crucified. What do you mean crucified? Look. All at 311 Lenox? All at 311 Lenox. And some of them had these strange symbols branded on their wrists. - Holocaust survivors? - I don't know. They're all blacked out. Ongoing murder investigations are classified. Even hundreds of years old? There's no statute of limitations on murder. Sorry. - Stacy. - Yeah. Did you get the owner, Ellington, whatever his name is, to change his mind about being on camera? Uh, yeah. Yeah, I told you he won't do it, so... And I don't care. I said I want him. Well, he can't. Then let me talk to him. No. Why not? Uh, because... um, because he's... He's what? Dead. What are you talking about? Wiki says he owns the building. Wiki says a lot of bullshit. David Ellington, born 1865, died 1934. New York death certificate. He was the owner of this place until then. And... he died here. Well, who's been texting you? And why is he pretending to be a dead guy? I don't know, but I can find out. Please do. And while you're at it, find out who owns the house now, so I know who's going to sue me for trespassing. Thank you. Billy. He did a good job down here. Let's check everything's okay. I'm going to lay some audio down. Check upstairs first. If Billy's up there, can you bring him down? What happened here? - What do you mean? - All their stuff is still here. Their clothes, their shoes, their crystals. Why didn't they have someone pack all this stuff up and have it shipped to wherever they are now? Well, all the details are murky, but from what I understand, whatever happened here... had the last tenants so freaked out, that they didn't want anything that reminded them of it. Or they didn't want that shit to follow them. Exactly. Well, there's no reception. Wait, hold on. ...Can't take your call. Please leave a message after the tone. Billy, where the hell are you? Please, call me back. We're ready to do a baseline reading. Alison. Bag. Room. Hate. Much. You. Someone needs to secure the windows. It's drafty upstairs. Yeah! I'm on it already. Just give me a couple minutes, babe. Mm-hmm. Hey, do you guys know what Novum is? I couldn't find anything on the Internet about it, other than it's Latin for "nine." Yeah, because it is also the name of one of the most stealthy, vicious, satanic cults that exists. Their mission is to get Lucifer back to heaven, where he belongs, because he used to be a good angel, and they believe he can be again. Originally Lucifer was an angel for God, until he fell from grace. Novum have been around since Christ, worshiping Lucifer. Okay, and who do they target? They believe that the truest, purist form of sacrifice to God, is the most precious life to the most devoted to God, and the most precious to them. Novum believes that in order for Lucifer to get back to heaven, and in God's good graces, they need to kill 59,049 firstborns of people of the cloth. What? So, how many people have they killed? All right. What are you guys doing? We're all set. Are you ready? - Yup. Ready, ready. - Let's do it. Yup, set up. Good to go. Yeah, it's probably the circuit breaker. - We'll check it out. - Whoa, hold on. If it's anything electrical, I'll do it. Bring the equipment with you. Check for activity while you're down there. If this is Billy, we're going to have words. In the back, it's near the boiler. Okay, so, the power just went out. Get the lights back on, which will determine what happened to them. People who believe in the paranormal believe that power sources have been known to drain when depressed by spirits. Those people also believe that an entity will use the power from batteries and other power sources to manifest themselves in our world. That's why we're here. To investigate. You guys hear that? Gary? Yeah, I'm here. All right, time for an EVP. If there's anyone down here, can you make that sound? We're here to help you. Can you make that sound again? - You hear that? - Yeah. It's in here. Ready? Uh-huh. It stopped. You guys hear anything? If you're in here, can you make that sound again? I, uh... Watch your head. What a loser. There we go. - Not a ghost. - Not a ghost? Nope. Let's leave them in the dark for a little bit longer. I got a camera right on Stefan. Sounds good to me, man. We'll turn the power back on in five minutes. All right, cut, Jamie. Stacy? Stacy? She was just here. Gary, get the light on! I'm trying. Something's shorting out the box. Tim! No! Stacy, Lisa, what's going on? Where are you? Lisa? Where's Stacy? Hello? Lisa, where are you guys? Gary? Jamie? Stacy? Stacy? Stacy? Stacy! Stacy! Stacy. Stacy! Stacy! Stacy! Stacy. Gary? Jamie? Gary! Oh, damn it. Come on. Shit! Shit! Fuck. No! No. No, please, please, stop! Please, please stop! Stop! Don't kill me! Please, please, stop! No! Surprise! Aw, baby. I'm so sorry. Oh! You should have seen your face, seriously. Hey, where's Billy? Your guess is as good as mine. Wait, he wasn't a part of this? He helped plan, but was a no-show. You never looked better. I love you all, and you're fired. Really? Are you surprised? All right, all right, all right, all right. Are we going to do a show tonight or what? - Let's get to work. - Still no Billy, guys? No. I've cycled through every video feed that we have. He's not here for sure. I have him setting up earlier, but never leaving. All right. I'm going to go outside, see if I get better reception. There's just no reception. - Uh, Tim? - Shit, I had two bars... - Tim! - What? Billy? Billy. What the hell, man? What are you doing? Oh, God. Like, why can't you just make my life easy, huh? Why do you constantly have to create drama? You don't understand. Understand what? What are you... hey, look at me. Jamie, turn the camera off. What's up with the ball? Jamie? Come on, Billy. Billy, come on. I can't go back in there. Go ahead. Okay, just listen to me. This is not a ghost ball. It isn't supernatural. This is just a regular ball. No, it's not. You see that? There's nothing there. Billy, there is a logical explanation for whatever you think happened here. How can you not believe in evil after what we've seen? Paranormal or not. Now, if you believe in evil, then you have to believe in God. And God beats evil, doesn't he? Look... you did a really great job setting everything up in there. No, I'm serious. You did. Really. So why don't you come inside and see how it feels? You can always leave again if... whatever. Okay? Okay. Come on, bud. Hey, uh, maybe you want to leave that out here. It's just a regular ball. Listen, whatever he thinks happened to him, it really freaked him out. Honestly, I've never seen him like this before. I'm actually pretty worried about him. Yeah. We should interview him. I mean, I think he's still messing with us, but if he actually saw something we should get him on camera. At least he'd be contributing something. I'm asking you to back off. Tim, this is a really great story line. Please. Okay. Sure. Thanks. I really don't want to do this. Okay, now... I'm not doing this. No. No, I'm not, really. Okay? Please, Billy. Okay, why don't you just have a seat on the edge of the bed, right there. I really don't want to do this. Tim says we have to. So, tell me about the ball. - You're fucking with me. - I'm not. - I'm not doing this. - I'm not, really. I... I know you and Tim don't see eye to eye on the whole God and ghosts thing, but you know I believe. I'm with you on this one. Look, even though you may not like me... we've had our share of run-ins in the past about other things, at least I know you respect that I'm a believer like you, and the only thing that really counts in life. Really? See, I had no idea that... that you were such a man of God. Come on, of course you did. Now... what did you see here when you were alone? You don't want to know. I really do. Trust me on this one. You don't. Please, Billy. Well, I saw a lot of dead people. Really? Like who? You, for one. Stefan, I told you to back off! And I told you it was good TV. Lest you forget, that's what we're trying to do here, make a television show. Hopefully one that'll get us on a network, so suck it up! Take the camera, and don't point it at the lights. Just point it here... - Wait... - Yeah. What else are you going to take? Somebody give me something to put on television. Are we all set? EVP and laser grids are set. Infrared camera's replaced, right? Billy? What? Stefan asked if you replaced the IR cameras. Oh. Yeah. Thanks. Ready. You look beautiful. - Thank you. - Where's Jamie? Uh... I don't know, but we need him to shoot the intro. Billy, grab a camera. Yup. You okay? Yeah, sure. Can we do a quick little bup, bup, bup... We've set up motion sensors and cameras in every room. We've got night-vision for later. Laser... thermal cameras and laser grids. And everything is linked back to the video village. As we like to call it, central command. Where we can capture anything that happens. Or doesn't. On me, in three... us... in three, two... let's take a look around. We've set up motion sensors and cameras in every room. We got night vision for later, laser grids, and thermals. And everything is linked back to the video village. We like to call it central command. Where we can capture anything that happens. Or doesn't. Billy, come on, man. Yeah, um... do you guys want to start down here? Let's just do this, okay? Yeah, okay. Tim, we got movement in the upstairs bedroom. What? There's something in the front of the house. Okay, copy. We'll check it out. Okay, we're going to check out this reported movement. Oh, Jesus! Fuck! - Come on, Jamie! - Payback! - Fuck. - Oh, I got to get this. Hey, hey, hey, hey, Billy, no. - Whoa. - No, stop, stop. It's not funny, asshole! - You deserved it. - Fuck you, all right? Stay the fuck away from me. What? It was just a prank. Hey, cut the crap. Seriously! Enough! We have a show to do. Billy. Guys, where's Billy? He went outside. No, baby, just let him cool off. He'll be okay. Really. Okay. We have a job to do, so no more pranks. Agreed? Um... oh, I have movement. For real this time? - No more games. - No games. Front bedroom, second floor. - What was that? - That felt like an earthquake. It's probably just the radiator going on. Clanking ducts, or whatever. You picking up that noise? Oh, yeah. - From the bedroom? - Yup. There's more movement. Where? Looks like it's right in front of you. Everybody's accounted for, right? That's not any of us. And it's definitely not Billy? He's not in the house. Wait, do you hear that? It's getting louder. Yeah, there's definitely something moving around in there. Guys, whatever it is, it's coming from right on the other side of that door. Okay, we've ruled out one of the crew members moving around inside this room. So, it's time to take a look. There's nothing here, Gary. Gary, check again for Billy. Everybody look for Billy. Billy? - Billy? - Billy! Billy! I'm not finding him in the house. - Billy? - Billy! Billy! - Gary... - What? Gary, Gary, take a look at this. Jesus. - Billy! - Stefan, look at this. What? Billy, really? Alison, what the fuck are you doing? You shouldn't be helping him. Alison? Take her down. What's going on? I heard a scream. Fuck the door. Fuck! Call 911. I'm trying. It's dead. My phone is dead. Hey, help us! What the fuck? I'm sorry. Do you have service? - No. - Okay, come on, we got to go. - We can't just leave her. - It's not safe. We got to go. We'll come back for her. Come on. Help us! Help us! No, we've got to stay together. Are we going to the basement or not? - Yes. - No. No. No, someone needs to man video village and watch our backs. Okay? So you three come with me to the basement, and you go with Gary and Lisa to video village, okay? We're going to find a way out of here, guys. Stay close. Okay, uh, you guys go in there, you guys come with me. We're going to find a way out of here. Stay close. - All right. - Stay back. Jamie, what the hell are you doing? Put that away. Jamie, put that away, and help us. What are you doing? Tim? Jamie, Jamie! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. We got to get him out of here. Jamie, come on. - Get him out of here. - Come on, come on. Come on. Tim, I can't, he's too hurt. Okay, put him down, put him down. You got it, okay? Guys, we need your help. The lights kept going on and off. What happened? What the hell happened to him? Bumped into the wall. He bumped into a wall? - How many times? - Tim, how can you not believe there's something paranormal going on in this house after everything you've seen with your own eyes? What I've seen with my own eyes, is Alison nailed to the wall, and Jamie tripping in a dark basement and bumping his head. There's nothing paranormal happening here. Someone killed Alison, and I'm going to find out who. Or, or, we could let the police figure that out, and we could figure out a way to get out of here. How come we can't open any doors or smash any windows? What's your logical explanation for that? Are there any symbols on her wrists? What? Please, someone go check to see if Alison had any symbols on her wrist. - And film it. - It's Alison. It's good TV. It's not like she's coming back to life anytime soon. Fine, give me this. What is that? I don't know. Hey, what do you guys see? Same as the ones in the Murphy house. There's nothing, but I'll keep looking. Wait, we have Internet? No. I'm checking our internal database. We still don't have power. I tracked the bogus info on Wiki, and saw that his page was updated yesterday. So who updated it? It said his wife. - Is she still alive? - No. That would mean she's a hundred years old. No, she's... she's dead. Mrs. Koenig died shortly after he did, in 1935. How did she die? She was crucified. Yeah. Uh... Gary, what is that? I don't know, I don't know. Uh, movement, but no corporeal bodies. The EMF's trampolining on mean, the laser could've been tripped. It's like an army is moving toward... Lisa! Lisa! - Oh, my God. - Lisa? What the fuck? Fuck! No, no. No number. Um, I got movement again upstairs. Front bedroom. They can't get you in here. Stacy, stay down here. No, that's not going to happen. Stacy! - Where's Billy? - He's in the study. What the fuck is he doing? I got movement in the back bedroom now, too. - Gary, did you get that? - What was that? The door slammed shut. You didn't see anything on video? - Negative. - Wait. I got something. Where? I think it's coming from right in front of you. There's nothing here. Maybe an echo? False reading? Dude, I'm telling you, there's something right there in front of you. It's just inside the door. Yeah, we can hear it. We're going in. Three, two, one. Guys, there's nothing here. No, I know, um... the activity is gone. It's just... it's just gone. Guys, there's nothing here. Fuck. Hey. They're numbers. The symbols on their wrists, they're numbers. It's biblical Hebrew. It looks similar to Arabic to the untrained eye. You read right to left. They're Hebrew numbers. Tim! Stacy! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Is that Stefan? Is anybody going to say anything? Dear God in heaven... please take these sweet souls, and please show mercy and forgiveness to the troubled souls that took them from us. Excuse me? Troubled souls? Our friends, my friend Lisa was murdered. Nailed to a wall with fucking railroad spikes. We're not dealing with troubled souls. We're dealing with sick fucking murderers. Okay, come on, he was just trying to... Trying to what? He's been acting crazy since we got here. Really? I think I've been as serene as you've ever seen me, brother Jamie. Dare I say even turned over a new leaf. - Fuck you. - Hey! Hey! Jamie, stop it! Come on, man! Look, we're all fucking scared and stressed out right now, but we need to stay calm. We're being systematically killed off, - and you're the one... - Okay, I that's enough. I said back off! Look, we got to stick together guys. All right? This is fucked up, but we can't let this warp what we know to be true. We know each other. Stacy, do you anything about who or what is doing this? Okay, Billy? Well, I'm with Stacy. I don't think it's human. Well, whatever it is, it's not any of us, okay? So we just need to stop misusing our energy and pointing fingers, and focus on what's fucking important right now: just staying the fuck alive, okay? Stay alive, stop misusing our energy. How's she doing? Yeah. I wish you would've had my back more. What are you talking about? When? In this life. Billy, come on. I'm your little brother. I've never let anything bad happen to you. Right? Is that algorithm working? Yeah, it is, but I only have like five minutes left of battery power. Oh, man. Billy... What? It's a total of 50,048. How do you know that? It's a total number of people since Christ was crucified who were murdered, and have the same ancient Hebrew numbers on their wrists, including Alison. But I thought all those photos were classified, and had those black bars covering them. And how about all the people that died before cameras even existed? I hacked into NASA and redirected rockets when I was 14 years old. - Thought they were just droids. - They were rockets. Wait, so 50,000 people have been killed with the same numbers on their wrists, and no one's ever heard about it? In the last 2,000 years, five billion have been murdered. Fifty-nine thousand is one thousandth of one percent. That's less than five people a year. That's not enough to draw attention to it as a serial situation for either the numbers on the wrist, or for them all being kids of priests. God told Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac. When he was about to do it, God said, "Stop, the fact that you were willing is enough." Novum is actually doing it. Alison was 59,048. They need one more to get to 59,049. Why is fifty thousand, whatever, the number of people they need to kill? It's nine to the fifth power. The Kabbalah says that the demonic number is two, the Jehovah's number is seven, seven and two is nine. This number keeps coming up. The ultimate demonic number is nine. And they believe that there are five angels of death to make up the demonic order. So, nine to the fifth power. Okay. And what does any of this have to do with Billy? Look. Even if I could, you'd still want to bring a baby in this world? Of course. There's so much evil. Why would you want to expose a sweet, innocent soul to that? That's why we absolutely must bring sweet, innocent souls to this world. Until that's the only thing the world knows. That's a beautiful thing to believe. With all my heart. That's just what I love you with. All my heart. And our little... African, or... ...Chinese, or Colombian, or New Jersey-an son or daughter will be the perfect soul for us. Well, it depends on what part of New Jersey, but I hear you. The demonic number is two. The Jehovah's number is seven. Seven and two is nine. Demonic number is two. The Jehovah's number is seven. Seven and two is nine. The demonic number is two, the Jehovah's number is seven. Seven and two is nine. The demonic number is two, the Jehovah's number is seven. Tim, can you come here, please? There's something you need to see. Yeah, I'm here, Gary. Can you just tell me what it is? I'm kind of in the middle of something. I can't. It's something you need to see with your own eyes. We should go. Okay, we're coming. Gary? Gary? What the... Gary? Gary? What the...? Goddamn it. Why won't you let us go? Let us out, please! What do you want from us? Oh, shit. Let us go. Why can't you...? Why won't you let us go? No! Open! No. Stacy, Stacy, Stacy... Baby, we should be the ones to leave. I don't understand. I don't understand. Come here, come here. It's okay, it's okay. Come here. It's going to be okay. We're going to be okay. We're going to be okay. We're going to be okay. Jamie! Jamie! No! - Oh, God! - Fucking no! I knew it was you all along. Jamie, no! No, no, no, please. I'm going to end this now. Jamie, listen to me, listen, listen... - Jamie, you don't understand. - Jamie, Jamie, stop it. - Let's talk about this. - I don't want to die. Jamie, no. No. - Jamie, it's not... - No! - Jamie! - Jamie! - Jamie... - No! Jamie, Jamie... Jamie, stop it! No! - Stop it! - Tim, pull it! I'm pulling! Stop! I can't stop it! Take me! No! - No! - Jamie... No! No! No! Jamie! Oh, God. Jamie! - No, no, no. - Oh, God. - No! - Billy... Take me! - The door... - Tim, the door. Let's go, let's go! Take me! Billy? Billy! Billy, come on! Billy, let's go! Billy! No! No, no, no... - Billy! - No, baby, stop! Stacy! Stacy! Stacy... Billy. No! No! No! No! Billy! Billy! Billy! Come on. Billy! Someone help! So, is she going to be okay? She's going to be fine. She has a very minor concussion, a couple of bumps and bruises. She was very lucky. Hey, did you know you're pregnant? That's impossible. I can't have children. You can, and you're going to, and the two of you are going to be right as rain. I mean, what do we know? Do we know if it's a boy or a girl? It'll probably take a couple of weeks - until we can determine the sex. - It's a boy. How do you... how do you know that? Well, listen, she needs some rest. - She's been through a lot. - Yeah. Both of you have been through a great deal. All I can say is congratulations, and best of luck to both of you. * Rambo Media Ltd *
