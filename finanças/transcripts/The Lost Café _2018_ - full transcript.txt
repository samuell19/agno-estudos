In fact, that's how the whole thing -just played. It just played out. -Mm-hmm. -Hey! [cheers] -Hey! -You look great. -Thank you. -Sorry to keep you waiting -You smell great, too. Oh, it's fine. How are you? Is that it? I mean, is that all you can say to your girlfriend that you've not seen in six months? You guys are a very boring couple and you deserve each other. -I met your cousin. She is nice. -Mm-hmm. You see? Someone actually thinks great of me! I really love that you're a nice guy but you don't have to be polite with her. -Really? -Why don't you just sit down. I'll get you something to drink and then, maybe we can go. -Did you meet my mom? -No. Ah! She's at the neighbor's. Well, then, uh... [doorbell rings] [indistinct chatter] [Ose] Yeah, I do not know where that is. -Hakeem. -Yeah? Remember that story I told you about my friend, extra lessons, ETC? Mm-hmm. Dora, Hakeem. Hakeem, Dora. -Hi. -Hi. -Now she, you can be nice to. -[laughing] Should we go? [Efe] Hi, Dora. Yeah, sure, why not? Um, ladies, it's been a pleasure. Sorry I couldn't meet your mom, though. I'm sure you'll love her when you do. Yeah. Dora, we can drop you off somewhere. -[Efe] Well, Hakeem, um... -Yes? That's actually brand new. You should handle with care. I'm sure you know what I'm talking about, right? I mean it, though. I mean, [in pidgin] she's brand new. [in English] Untouched. [laughs] [laughs] I thought we were supposed to meet at the cinema? Yeah. But, I didn't suspend unpacking just to spend the day like kids. You deserve better. Besides, I'm staying at this hotel until the house is decent enough to live in. I could show you around, if you want. The hotel? Yeah. That's not necessary. Are you afraid of me, baby? Of course not. OK. Uh... Come. -Come on. -We have to go now? -Yeah. -But why? [Hakeem] Come on. I have something to show you. So Efe tells me this Norway thing is still going on. -Norway thing? -Yeah. I'm going to film school. Yeah. But film and Norway, they don't click. Writing? Yes. Norway has a film culture. Besides, tuition is free for all students. That's not something that my father was going to turn his nose at. Right, right. So, [chuckles] how is the sex industry over there? Have our Nigerian sisters... Hakeem. I'm just curious. [chuckles] I can count the number of times we've held hands. It's always been Skype. And then, now that I moved back here, you are off to God knows where already. It's not fair. Yeah, but what about what I want? If you must, go to a Nigerian school, there's one in Jos. I can't believe I'm listening to this. Babe, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I am. I'm jealous, selfish. You are going to Norway to study what you love and be a great filmmaker. I get it. -Do you? -Yeah. I got you something. Come, my Norwegian girl. Come. The other time, I tried to get the old one but it didn't work out anyway. So... this is where I stay for now, at least until I... Now... Let me just get something. So, like I said, I don't know... I got you something, but I know it's not much... [birds chirping] [Hakeem sighs] And when you return, I would very much like to be introduced to your family. Like, officially. There's no point delaying the inevitable. We love each other. Let's make it work. I will call you every single morning. -[Ose] I love you. -I love you, too. I have to go. All right, take care. I will call in the morning. OK. Evening, Momma. We almost reported you missing at the police station. [sighs] Reported who? Me? But I got back on time now. It's just after eight. You left this house with a strange man, and you were not picking my calls. You know Hakeem now. Hakeem is not a strange man. You know. How long have you even known him? Hmm? Long enough. Are you all right? [chuckles] I'm fine. Good night, Mommy. See you tomorrow. [in Norwegian] I don't understand. Why do I have to share my room with someone else? This is the only room they had left. -You have to... -[in English] Hello. [in Norwegian] ...try and live here if you want to go to this school. But schools everywhere have only single rooms. Sunniva, listen, I really don't have time for this now. So then, why did you even bother to come at all? [in English] Excuse me. Sorry to cut in. You are not Inge Hendriksen? -Yes. -My God. I can't believe this. I'm a huge fan. [in Norwegian] OK, Sunniva, I must go now, see you later. [in English] Bye. Thank you. Did I say something wrong? Beside pronouncing her name wrong? No. Oh. So, you're my new roommate? Yes. I'm-- Sorry. -Ose. -Sunniva. When did you move in? Uh, four days ago, I think. And how did I get to be so lucky? Meeting one of the biggest filmmakers in Norway on my first day. Must have been some of the Greek gods or something. Do you work for her? I can't say I earn enough as her daughter. She is your mother? [sighs] She is amazing. No, she's not amazing. But yeah, that was my mom. Those are really good. You should be a fashion designer. No. No, I should be a movie director. -Babe! -[Ose] Hey! You got my email? Duh. How else would I have gotten your new number? [smacks lips] I can be so stupid sometimes. Eh... So, how's it going? Fantastic! You'll never guess who my roommate's mother is. OK, I'm guessing you'll tell me. Inge-- [in Norwegian accent] Inge Henriksen. [in normal accent] See, I'm learning to talk like a Norwegian now. [Hakeem laughs] Henriksen, hmm... who is that? I told you about her. That Norwegian top filmmaker. The one whose film I really love, the one that I made you watch. -OK, OK, I get it. -Sorry, I just-- I was really excited. Anyway, did you move out of your hotel yet? [Hakeem] Mm... Sometime this week. [Ose] OK. Uh, just a second. I need to just-- Hey! Sorry, I would have loved to talk now but I'm going to be late for school. I have to go. I'll talk to you later? OK. I love you. [lecturer] Some of you will become directors. Some of you will become editors, actors, scriptwriters, DPs, while others will become focus pullers and best boys. [all chuckle] But seriously, um, your journey to become a good filmmaker is a long and tedious one. And it takes passion. You might ask, why passion? Because there are so many letdowns and so much competition. Our work here as teachers is to chisel away everything, until there is nothing left except what makes you special, the unique you, your cinematic vision. We don't need another Spielberg or another Scorsese. What we need is the authentic you. Yes. Miss. Ose Adeosa. Welcome, Ose. Thank you. I was wondering when we get divided into groups. Uh, this is just an introduction. We'll do that next week. OK. I hope you don't run out of steam by then. [chuckles] Any other questions? [door opens] [rock music playing] [Ose sighs] Mm... Why is life so difficult at the UDI? [Sunniva] Because we don't like strangers stealing our stuff. -What? -Nothing. Weren't you supposed to be in my class this morning? Have a fun night in. Where are you going? Out of this world. Away from perfect creatures. [imitating] "Out of this world. Away from perfect creatures." [phone ringing] [disconnects, dials again] [phone ringing] [ringing continues] [mother, on video] ...beautiful daughter who won't allow me cook her father's meal in time. [Ose] And what are you cooking today? Yams and vegetables. [Ose] Uh-uh. And I think that you should go right now and begin to peel the yams, you know, before I take that thing from you. -Do you have your guide book? -Yes, Mommy. Is this how you are going to carry this thing? It's very expensive, you know. I can't lose my camera, Mommy. It's not going to happen. [car honks] Daddy is waiting. We should go. Daddy can wait, Ose. [sighs] Ose, do you really hate it so much here? Is it? -I never said that. -OK, OK. Everybody is talking about your traveling. You know, just the same kind of things they were saying when your Aunty Edosa went and then she came back and got married. [Efe clears throat] Sorry to interrupt the family coziness. Efe, wow, come in. -Be nice. -I'll try. Come, come, come. You already wished me a safe journey yesterday. Oh, please, get over yourself. You're not that important. Then what are you doing here? [chuckles] Ose. I'm not the bad one here. OK. I'm the one that went to Germany to whore around, right? I'm really not the bad person here. You need to shine your eyes. I mean, you really need to shine your eyes. You don't know who anybody is anymore. Ose. Your dad is about to tear the street apart with curses. Come on, let's go. [Ose] OK, we will go. -Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, Ose, let's go. -Yes, Mommy, yes, Mommy. Your father is almost having a heart attack. Neorealism, in European film history was a revolution. It was for the people. Life as it is and not some fantasy world created in a studio. In fact, neorealism made everything that came before it look dated. Neorealism also had a left-leaning political view. It was a social conscious cinema, not afraid to criticize society and the establishment. To get the authenticity that the neorealist directors were looking for, they would often use amateur actors. People who hadn't learned to fake in front of a camera. -[Ose] Ah, like Carlo Battisti. -[lecturer] How do you know Battisti? [clears throat] I'm a big fan of Vittorio De Sica's Umberto D, and I think his performance in it is astonishing. Go on. I feel like his performance is underrated and that perhaps, that's because he wasn't a professional actor and also because it's the only film he ever did. I mean, you never see his name on any best performers lists. I also think the film itself is... highly underrated. Well, you are right, that it is not as well-known as many other neorealistic films by De Sica. In fact, it did not fare well when it first came out... but I do think it is generally regarded as a masterpiece today. I feel like it should be more popular. Especially when you compare it with its contemporaries. Films like High Moon or Singing in the Rain or A Streetcar Named Desire. [lecturer] To be honest, those are very different films. Hm. Umberto D does not deal with fear like High Noon or passion like A Streetcar Named Desire. And it most definitely does not have the humor or the catchy tunes of Singing in the Rain. Hm. It's about an old man dying. Hardly the stuff of a box office success. What about that Pixar movie, Up? That had a similar theme and it did very well, I think. That is a very good point, Ose. Many, in fact, talked about Pixar's folly when they made Up. No one believed a cartoon about an old man would be a hit. So that leaves the question, why was Up a hit and Umberto D not? Hm? Is it the quality of the film or distribution? Anyone else want to contribute to the topic? Anyone? [sighs] Right. We will continue this in a week. So please come prepared. Um, to tackle the assignment mentioned earlier, I have taken the liberty to divide you all into groups. And I will assign you leaders of the groups right now. Right! Let's see. Um... Group one will be headed by Andre. [Andre] Yes. Great. Group two will be headed by Thor. [Thor] Yes. [claps hand] There you are. Group three will be headed by Antonio. [Antonio] Yes. [lecturer] And group four... Ose will lead the group. Right, so, your first assignment will be to come up with a concept for a short film that each group will make. OK. I would like to ask the group leaders to come up here now and take the name of your leaders, members, and plan a meeting for the project. OK? So, everyone, now just find your members and gather and plan meetings for the future. -OK. -[Ose] Thanks, everyone. Uh... Lene. -Eirik. -Mm. And Sunniva. [Sunniva] Hi. Uh, I am Ose and I was thinking that-- Hi. Is everything OK over here? [in Norwegian] Is it possible to change groups? I just don't think we will work very well together as we are roommates. No, there is no possibility of changing groups. If there are any further questions, you can come talk to me later. OK? [in English] Anyway, I was saying, I'm Ose. I'm glad to be a part of the team. Thank you. You see. So, I was thinking that we could meet during the class trip and brainstorm ideas then. If that works for everyone? -[Sunniva] Sure. -Yeah. So, I guess the meeting is over then. [phone ringing] [Ose, over phone] What? How long have you known this-- your gorgeous boyfriend? [in pidgin] I dey warn you, [in English] stay away from Hakeem. [laughs] He's not my type. Too young. You know what they say, "The older the wine, the better the taste"? [in pidgin] Yes, I know the kind of men you like. [in English] Your boyfriend and, uh-- What did you call her? Your best friend of your youth are now an item. They are now lovers in this Calabar. What did you say? Your best friend and your boyfriend are lovin' up in this Calabar. [hisses] [phone ringing] Hello. Did you get my mail? [party music playing] [inaudible dialogue] Have you ever been in love, Sunniva? [Sunniva] Can you blow out the candles when you're done, please? [birds chirping] [traditional beat playing] For the lady who makes eating swallow and soup so sexy. [Ose laughs] OK. Thank you. You want to sit down? [in Norwegian] Hello, what will you have? [in English] Uh... Hi. Sorry, I don't speak Norwegian. Oh, all right. -Uh, I can just pour you some coffee? -Oh, no, no, no. -Oh. -Thank you. Maybe later? Maybe later. Just look at this and let me know. I apologize. Young people these days don't know how to treat a lady right. -Thank you. -Coffee? No. I don't drink coffee. [chuckles] I have never heard of a Norwegian who don't like coffee. Uh,... You still haven't. I'm not Norwegian. You sure? How do you know? I'll make you a deal. I'll make you a cup of coffee, you don't like it, I... -OK. -OK? -Hm. -One moment. [Ose] Uh... I have never seen coffee made like that before. Where did you learn to make that? Long tradition. Long line of men trained to please others, runs in the family. There you go. -Smells interesting. -Mm-hmm. Mmm. I think I just won the bet. -Yeah, I think maybe you did. -Mm-hmm. You're just such a sad young lady. I'm not sad. I maybe blind on the one eye but the other one sees perfectly, I see. What it doesn't see is where you are from. You are not from around here, are you? Uh... No. I'm-- I'm from Nigeria. Oh, that's a... That's a long way from home. -Yes. -Hm. Yes, it is. [groans softly] Actually, I think I should get going. Oh. Really? You won't finish your coffee? No. But thank you anyway. How much do I owe? Nothing. -Really? -Yeah. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Mm-hmm. -Bye. -Have a nice day. Babe. Are you there? [Ose] I'm here. Uh, you haven't been taking my calls, you haven't been calling me back. Is there something I should know? I've been extremely busy, new project at the office. I meant to call back but... Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. I miss home, I miss you, and I'm not sure what to believe. Believe... what? Are you mad at me because I didn't call you back? No, I'm mad because you did. Because now I have to ask and... I don't want to know, but if I don't ask, I'm not going to be able to sleep, so... [nervous sigh] [smacks lips] Ose, are you all right? You're not making any sense. I don't want to know. I don't want to know. Hmm. -Ose, are you on crack now? -I wish. You know what, can we talk tomorrow? Or something. Yeah. Sure. Wait. Wait, wait. You're sure there's nothing I should know? Like what? I don't know. Anything. I'm fine, Ose. Really. You're fine. OK then. We'll talk later. Great. I love you. Same here. [indistinct Norwegian chatter] Maybe we put the camera in front of Lene's face first. -No. No, no, listen. -[Lene] Yeah, I think. What we need to do here is that-- you have to put the camera behind her, because there-- [Ose] ...Sunniva. Because then we will get a better view of the background. [Ose] Sunniva. [in Norwegian] Here is your screenplay, why don't you sort them out? [crows cawing] [Eirik] Hi. [in English] When I was younger, my dad use to bring me here. It hasn't changed much. Your diary? Something like that. You're far from the rest. May I have a look? [sucks teeth] You're a good storyteller. Hey, we should use your story for our project. No, thanks. What's wrong? Nothing is wrong. Everything is fine. There's something haunting about the way you look today. You don't know what I look like every other day. [river flowing] [Eirik] Your camera. Thank you. You know, your knowledge in European films inspired me to search some African films to watch. -Really? -Yeah. Well, there's nothing wrong in learning what other people are doing. So what did you think? Uh, yeah... they're big on morality. Morality, isn't it kind of ambiguous, depending on who is judging? Yeah. Yeah, I think it's like that in Europe. -Did you see anything by Sembene? -Who? Ousmane Sembene? -No. -[scoffs] You don't know who that is? No. [sighs] We always know everything about you guys and you guys never know anything about us. Anyway, Sembene says it's a disgrace for people to wait for another people to feed and clothe them. I don't understand. There's more nobility in prostitution as long as you earn your own living, make your own way, than going around looking for handouts. Kind of like what Africa does with Europe and Europe is happy to give the alms. So, we have a motivation for a suicide. But we still don't understand the other choices the protagonist has to make. What is it with life and choices? Is life based on a series of choices we make... or not? Ose. What do you think? We are talking about the choices in the script we just studied. Uh... [sighs] -I-- -Right. OK. Anyone else? I don't know if life is that simple. Not everyone has a choice. Someone who gets cancer didn't choose that. I think life is a mix of choices and coincidences. [lecturer] That's a good point, Eirik. Well, that will be all for today. Thank you. Ose? Is, um... Is something wrong? You look distracted and you don't seem as engaged as you have been. I'm sorry. OK. Whatever it is that is distracting you, fix it. Yes, ma'am. Ose. Ose, wait. Why are you following me? Ose! What's going on with you? You're acting really strange. [in pidgin] This guy, free me now. I be wetin? [in English] Hey, I'm not the enemy here. [hisses] [mellow music playing] [Ose] Hi. I was here last time. I'd like to order the special coffee. The special one? Yeah, sure. There you go. A deep sigh for a sad lady. I didn't hear you come in. I was just close by. -May I? -Yes, please. My father used to say, a cup of coffee a day makes the blues go away. If only. You never really told me about your Nigeria. -What's there to tell? -Everything. I have never been to Africa before, uh, I would like to see it through your eyes. What do you miss most about home? [traditional beat playing] [Ose] The sounds. A hundred different languages, each one with its own -cadences and tones of intensity. -[laughing] And then they all come together to form something completely new that borrows a little bit from each one and create its own slangs, and speech patterns and gestures. The way one minute we are like, yelling like it's the end of the world and then, the next, we are teasing strangers with the intimacy of old lovers. The way everybody's business is everybody's business. The drums, that rhythm. The way it's almost a taboo to let it just go to waste. It's a command that you have to obey, it's a call you must answer. [Hakeem] For the lady who makes eating swallow and soup so sexy. Ah, beautiful. Heartbreak Hotel, is it? It's usually only love that can make the heart go into a million tiny pieces. Look at them. Eh... I know how it feels to love and lose. When two young people like that are in love, they tend to forget that a heart gets so brittle, it's so easily broken, it's like glass. I never said my heart was broken. [laughs] But that, my young lady, is in your eyes. I don't know if I should be heart... broken. He's not with me. Is he far away? Mm-hmm. If I had a beautiful young girl like you, I would be with her all the time. I would not let her out of my sight. [chuckles] What is it that you love about him? Everything. Everything is nothing. Often, we fall in love with just one thing. Well, then, I guess his smile, his wit. He's very good with words. But you just described a thousand young men that you will meet in your life. Look here, sir, I didn't come here for an interrogation. Aren't you in love with him then? Are you saying I don't know if I'm in love or not? I gave him the most valuable thing that I have, and he gave me this as a symbol of his love. So, what does it signify? -What kind of... -Well, obviously, it's so that I will always remember him. Did you plan to forget him then? [scoffs] Look, he gave it to me the night that we... You know... When I was young and fiery, I gave a woman my whole heart. I'm not surprised she left you. You are just a cynical, bitter old man. But I don't want you to become like me. That's never going to happen. [birds chirping] [phone vibrates, rings] Hello. [Ose] Dora, I need to ask you something. Ose, you finally remembered to call me. When last did you see Hakeem? What? I can't hear you. When last did you see Hakeem? Did you follow him to the club? Are you sleeping with my boyfriend? Where did you get that horrible idea? -Efe told me that she-- -That she what? Ose, the way I see it, you would rather believe your prostitute cousin over your best friend? I don't know what to believe right now. And I don't know what to say to you. ["Man of Iron" by Amanda Tenfjord playing] ♪ I walked this road A hundred times before ♪ ♪ Into the woods ♪ ♪ Into the fire ♪ ♪ Believed your lies Too many times before ♪ ♪ It was a fault based on your silence ♪ ♪ But now I know that We ain't going back no more ♪ Yes, please, you know what I like. Thank you. I wanted to apologize for the way I behaved last time. I'm not usually like that, walking out on you, speaking the way I did, saying what I did. But I was upset, the things you said... I love Hakeem. And so I did too, she was my whole life. Who? Oh, her. I thought that I couldn't be alive without her, she was everything in my life. So, then, what went wrong? Well, I realized that I was actually in love with my imagination. Are you saying she turned out to be a bad person? No! She was not a bad person. It's just that we were incompatible. We were the wrong choice. How do you know? She failed the test. There's a test, what test? I mean, she didn't keep her promise, didn't come back for me. So, then you should have gone after her. I don't know, the universe decides that. When two people are in love, the universe tries to keep them together as much as it can. Um, they have to make the choice, the universe decides. The choice to stay or to leave is always their own. Sometimes fear keeps them from making that choice. So, what are you afraid of? Huh? [Ose] OK, guys. Based on the emails you guys sent me, by popular vote, we've decided to go, on everyone's agreement with-- drum roll please-- Lene's script. [Eirik] Did we? It's good. Anyway. It's a one-woman experimental film, and I've assigned roles for everyone. [in Norwegian] Good Job. I heard you. [in English] So, Anna will be played by Lene. Yeah. Hm. -Eirik will be on camera. -[Eirik] Cool. And Sunniva will be on costumes. OK. Uh, is that all, just the costumes? I thought you'd like that? Why would I go to film school if I wanted to design costumes? So, you're going to direct and I'm going to design the costumes? I'd thought you'd like that. Well, if you want, I can-- That's the problem. You never ask me what I want. Sunniva. [in Norwegian] Sunniva, come back. Let's finish what we started. Don't tell me like that, Eirik. You support her every time. Why don't you sleep with her and get over your obsession! -[phone vibrates] -[in English] Yeah, Mama. Uh, I think we should schedule this for another time. I guess. Thanks, Lene, thanks, Eirik. She didn't mean that. -She hates me. -[door opens] -There's no reason to. -[door closes] What was that? I missed it, it was too fast. No, don't worry about it, nothing to do with you. [sarcastically] Mm-hmm. Ose, this is not your fault, OK? Don't worry about it. Thank you. -Yeah. -I will try to convince myself about it. Yeah, do that. See you tomorrow. See you. [music playing through headphones] What was that about? You embarrassed me in front of the others. What is your problem? [in Norwegian] Listen up! [in English] Just because you think you can speak Norwegian, that doesn't make you any more one of us, OK? You just sound like the woman from Google Translate. [laughs] At least I try to get along with people around me. We have nothing in common. How much do you have to have in common with someone to treat them with basic human respect? I am not the cause of your problems. [in pidgin] You sa meet me before? You see me for dream? [in English] Is there something about me you have a problem with? Yes, actually. -[scoffs] -OK, I don't like how you always are so overly excited and happy about things, and I don't care about your love life and your cheating boyfriend. And you know what drives me crazy? How you always think that you know everything about me. You know what drives me crazy? The fact that you're wasting three years of your life, doing something you know you don't want to do just because you want to get a little bit of attention from Mommy. How dare you talk to me like that? Just because you are the first Nigerian woman in Norway who isn't a prostitute. [scoffs] What-- [indistinct Norwegian chatter] [phone chimes] [Ose] Hello. Anybody here? [old man] So, you couldn't wait for me, huh? Where did you come from? I was close by. Are you closed? I can come back tomorrow. No. You can help me clear these plates and I will make you a coffee. That's a deal I can work with. So... How are you? I've been all right, I guess. [spoons clatter] Ah! This is hard work. You're a talented man. Actually, I tell a lie. I haven't been great. I've been thinking about what you said last time that we spoke. And... I think you're right, I am afraid. So, what are you afraid of? I don't know, the truth. Truth hurts. And-- If he confirms it, if he admits that he's been cheating on me, I don't know if I can deal with it. And what if he does? Well, obviously I'll be devastated, heartbroken, all of the above. We all come with spare hearts, you know. Really? Was that the case with you and that girl that broke your heart? Oh, absolutely. I found a beautiful woman who I married and I have two wonderful children. -I made very good use of my spare heart. -Mm. [plates clatter] Good to see you smiling again. [chuckles] [Ose sighs] I-- My father cheated on my mother. I heard them yelling at each other that night. I couldn't sleep. [indistinct quarrel] [Ose] So, I tiptoed to their room and I listened. And suddenly, I understood... why a cousin had come to live with us, even though she wasn't the daughter of any relative I knew. I understood why Efe always acted like she belonged more in my own home than I did. She wasn't my cousin, she was my half-sister. And my mom accepted her in our home. Everyone is talking about your traveling. Just like there were things-- the kind of things they were saying when your Aunt Edosa traveled before she came back and got married. [Efe clears throat] Hey. Um, sorry to interrupt this family coziness. Efe, come right in. -Be nice. -I'll try. Hey, come in. You already wished me a safe journey yesterday. Get over yourself. You're not that important. [scoffs] So, then, why are you here? I'm not the bad person here. OK, I get it. I'm the one that went to Germany to whore around. Right? I am not the bad person here. [Ose] They have no idea that I know. That I've known for years. Including the part about how she helped him keep his secret. So, they both hurt you, huh? Yeah. I mean, I survived. But I just don't want to confirm that another man in my life has disappointed me. Would you rather be in denial? I mean, you're a strong woman. You got a good heart. And when the time comes to make a decision, you should trust you heart to make the right choice. See... [Sunniva] Look. I am so sorry for not making the shoot. So I was wondering if you maybe would like to grab a cup of coffee with me tomorrow? Sure. OK. [birds chirping] [Ose] Nah. What-what can possibly be wrong with this? It's all right, but I've had better. Where? Secret place. Show me. Maybe. I mean, you know, I'm still trying to absorb the fact that we're sitting here having this conversation. Why are you doing this? I thought you hated me. -I don't hate you. -You don't? No, I promise. I just-- I just didn't know how you would be like and I didn't know if we would go well together, so... I guess I just never bothered to try. And... And I was so angry at my mother, because she didn't want to help me with my rent and then suddenly, I-- suddenly I had to share my room with a stranger. So... So that made me start thinking, why am I going to this school? You know? Is it to prove a point to my mother? Or is it because I want it? [indistinct background chatter] And honestly, I don't know. [Ose] And cut. That's a wrap, guys. [clapping and cheering] Finally. [Ose groans] So, can we leave now or... -Yeah. I guess, if you want to. -Sure. [in Norwegian] You'll be at the end of semester party? Maybe. So, what's for dinner? Uh... I believe we have to edit before the party. I understand. OK then, see you later, right? Yes, see you later. [in English] She likes you. Yeah, I like her, too. As much as she does? I'm taken, Ose. [chuckles] -Uh... -So, Sunniva couldn't make it today? Yeah, she's dealing with some stuff, she needs some time. She's OK? She will be, eventually. [phone vibrating] Ose! You're sleeping with Dora. What? You're having an affair with Dora. [scoffs] Hold on a second. [phone beeps] Check your messages. Where'd you get that picture from? Is that the point right now? See, this isn't a debate. I just want to hear you say the words. Have you, Hakeem, been having an affair with my best friend? Ose. It happened just once. Your friend was a mere distraction. It was a mistake, it won't happen again, she means nothing to me. Ose! Ose! -[Ose] We should sit. This is it. -I want to sit there. [Ose] OK. [both laugh] Dora, are you sure we can afford this place? Because we don't have to... Hey, girl, this is the last time we get to do this before your trip, so don't worry. [laughs] [Ose] OK, girl, spending all my money. [Dora] Ah... Should we sit down here? -[Dora] Yeah, let's sit here. -OK. [Dora] You like it? Mm-hmm. -Hello, ladies. -Hi. Expecting someone? Uh, no. It's just us. Can we have menus, please? Well, we have a policy. We don't allow single ladies dine here without a companion. Of course. [chuckles] Brother, I know you're joking because what has Chimamanda been fighting for all these years? Well, I say the guy is serious. [laughs] He can't be. OK. Um... Come on. How about that guy? I think he's single, and that one... that one girl... So those ones are special because they are with men? Sorry, we don't want any problem. I'll advise you take your trade somewhere else. [scoffs] Trade? What-- Well, I say the guy call us a whore. -Girlfriend, hey, hey. -Dora. Let's just get the hell out of here, OK? It's their loss. No, let's stay. -No. Stop. Let's go. Let's go. -'Cause if we stay, he can't do anything. You call police, we have our money. -Is it not their loss? -It's your money, but still... -Let's go. -[scoffs] Excuse me. [Ose] OK. [sucks teeth] Stupid policy. [phone vibrates] Hey! Ose. [chuckles] Dora, I know. Ose, I'm so sorry. I swear, I can explain. It was a mistake. Ose, please. Hello. Don't ever call me again. Yes, Mommy, I'm fine. Do I sound funny? [clears throat] No. Uh, yes, class trip. Uh, we're going to Finnmark. It's somewhere in the country. We're going to see the northern lights. Yeah, I miss you too, but I'll be home soon. OK. Pray Daddy for me. Bye-bye. [movie playing on laptop] You know, if you're going to keep calling the whole of Nigeria, then you might as well just give up watching this film. -Come on. -I'm here now. You're too slow. What'd I miss? -Everything. -[clears throat] Really? [chuckles] You don't keep your mouth shut. Hmm. -So, are you dating Eirik yet? -Mind your own business. No... You better say yes before the holidays. Why? Because people get very lonely in the winter, I'm just saying. OK. Or maybe there are someone outside of campus? Actually, maybe. Really, who? You want to meet him? Yeah. I'll take you to him. -Are you kidding me? -[clears throat] Nice. He might not be what you're expecting. You don't know what I'm expecting. [indistinct chatter] -Yes, something like that. -I don't know what I'm doing. You're not trying, you're not applying yourself. So, where are you taking me? I swear it's the best coffee in the world. -It's going to be totally worth the walk. -OK. [indistinct chatter] ...right here is... [chimes] Ladies. Welcome back. Good to see you brought a friend. -Can I-- -What happened here? Uh... [laughs] I cleaned all the shelves, got rid of the dust. [laughing] Funny guy. Ose, aren't we supposed to go to a cafe? Yeah, yeah, this is the place. What are you talking about? They just changed a lot of stuff. Where did all the books come from? Uh, shouldn't have to say this but this is a bookstore, we have books. It's been a book shop for nearly 20 years now. So... Maybe we should just leave. This isn't the place we were going, right? -I know what this is. -What? -Play cool, play cool, it's a prank show. -Prank show? You know those all on TV? You go, you leave your car, you come back, your car is gone. There's a camera crew in the back. Hi. Hi. [in Norwegian] What is wrong with your friend? -What do you mean? -[Ose speaking indistinctly] She used to sit down there, talking to herself, everyone thought she was... [whistles] [in English] There's no one else here. No, there's not. Where's the other guy? He'll explain everything. What other guy? The one who makes the special coffee, the one with the eye. Who are you talking about? Oh, that's the guy, that's him on the wall there. That's my grandfather. [Ose] Yeah, so, where is he? He's dead, he died several years ago. Take it down if you like but... -Several years ago? -Yeah. So, who was I talking to a few days ago? I don't know. I really don't know. What-- Ose just you put the picture back on the wall, find another cafe. It's OK. [Ose] He's lying. What? -He's lying, obviously. There's no way... -Why would he be lying? -I don't know why he's doing it, but-- -OK. I'm-I'm lying now? Well, obviously, there's no other explanation for this. I was here, I spoke to this guy, so there's no way he's been dead for 20 years. [Sunniva and man speaking in Norwegian] [in English] I have a photo album of him, -pictures of him if you want to see it. -Yeah, sure. Maybe you will believe me then? Yeah, maybe. Yeah. OK. Ose, this is insane. We should just leave. It is insane, it's ridiculous what he's trying to make me believe. [Sunniva] Let's-- [sighs] [Ose] I was here, I sat down, who knows where and it was different. [man] OK, let's see-- there's a picture of him when he was young. [Ose] Pictures of-- [man] Here we go. This is my grandfather when he was younger. [Ose] No, this is the other guy. [man] What other guy? [Ose] This is the other guy. I was talking with this guy who you say is your grandfather. Then this guy and this girl were outside and they were all romantic, and they were loved up and he gave her flowers, and they walked off hand in hand and it was really sweet. But then the next time I was there again with your grandfather, they were fighting. I don't know what you've been smoking, but he's been dead for many years now, so, uh... I really can't help you. I've got some more pictures here, if you want to see. [Sunniva] Ose, can we just leave? Like, seriously. Satisfied? Sunniva. I think we should leave, OK? -Wait. -No, come on. -You understand what I'm saying, right? -Yeah, yeah... -You understand what I'm saying? -What? No. I, absolutely not. I was here. [Sunniva, in Norwegian] Bye, have a nice day. [in English] Here, take it. Take it, I've got plenty, just go. It's OK. [Sunniva, in Norwegian] So sorry about this. [man, in English] You're welcome. -[in Norwegian] Bye. -Bye, thank you. [door chimes] [in English] You kept convincing the man that he was wrong, -it was hilarious. -My phone is ringing. [phone vibrating] -Huh? What? -Eirik. Take it. Come on. Hello. Hey, Ose. It's me Eirik. Uh... I was just thinking... if maybe... W-- [whispers] He's asking me out. Say yes. Who's-- Are you with someone? No, no, no, that's just Sunniva being annoying. Oh. [laughs] Say hi. Yeah, so, uh, maybe we could just, you know, grab dinner. -Maybe. -OK. So, I guess I'll see you on the school trip? Yeah, I'm going for the trip, too. Yeah, cool. Yeah, I guess I'll see you then. OK then. Bye. [old man] Good choice, good choice.
