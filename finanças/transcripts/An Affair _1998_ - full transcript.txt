We're closing up. You'll have to leave. An Affair Sis, sorry I stood you up. Something really important came up at the last min Now it looks like it'll be another month before I get back. Oh, guess what! I'm engaged! Surprised? I'll tell you all about it next time I call. Bye. Engaged? I think it's great. It's a man she met over there. She's says he's back in Seoul. Then why hasn't he even tried to contact us? Ji-hyon probably asked him to wait still she got here waiting for. So, it's definite? She says she wants to have the wedding as soon as she gets back. Isn't she rushing things a bit? Dad, not so long ago you were pushing her to get m He doesn't mean it. Don't worry about it. I'm sure she's made a good c I guess so. But I think you should at least meet h All right. By the way, it all has to be changed. What? Didn't I tell you? No The wiring in the kitchen. It's bad. Really? I was sure I'd mentioned it... Have a nice trip. It's not a trip. It's training. Whatever. Be careful. Mom, don't forget to tape "K-Cops." Okay? I won't forget. See you! I'll call. More hot coffee, ma'am? Yes, thank you. So-hyon Kim? I guess I'm a little late. I'm sorry. I should've picked an easier place to f How long have you been back in Korea? About 20 days. How long did you live in the States? Fourteen years. I was expecting someone more, uh, matronly. I'm older than you might think. What exactly do you do? I guess you'd say I buy and sell rocks. Your parents must worry with you so far away. You're an only child, right? Yeah. Hello? Yes... Okay. I'm afraid I have to go. Gosh. What about the wedding? Where will you two live? There's so much we need to talk about. There's plenty of time. I suppose so. We should get together more often. Things seem to be going pretty well, in spite of the economy. Speak for yourself! It's been rough for me. Give us a break! Congratulations! The building looks fabulous. Thank you. And all of you, thanks for coming. I hear You did the interior of the building too That's right. It's pretty good, too, isn't it? Oh. Jun-il. Mr. Chairman. Have you met Jun-il Yun, the architect? I'm honored, sir. Glad to meet you. I've heard a lot about you from Good things, I hope. The building you designed is wonderful He went to see it for himself today. I'm glad you like it, sir. The chairman has another project in mind. Not one of those stuffy places. A different kind of art center. I met him by myself at a cafe. Dad says he'll wait and meet him with you when you get back. Uh-huh. Well, I don't know... No, it's not that I don't like him... How can I tell when I've only met him once? Sure... What? He's right beside you? No, wait a sec... Uh, how are you? I'm Ji-hyon's big sister. No problem. It's the least I can do. Oh, yes. Just a moment. It's her fiance's father. He has something to say to you. Well, hello. How are you? Make sure everything's in good order for the inspe And call me at the office when you're through. Yes, Sir I thought you might help me check out some places to live. Okay. But when? How about this weekend? I didn't know there were house like that by the Secret Ganden. The company rented it for me temporarily. Shall we start looking around here? Is the apartment for the two of you? No. You lucked out. The former tenants had to move suddenly. Hello. Hold on a second. Look around. Take your time. I guess we should keep looking. Good-bye, ma'am. Thanks for showing us around. Bye. What do you think? Not so great, huh? Would you want to live with someone in any of those places? Tomorrow let's try the suburbs. It's pretty big. I wonder if I can afford it. You like it? I like the lake better than the apartment itself. You know how that got that way? Well. A woman was in that room. She probably locked the door and wouldn't come out. Her man banged on the door until he finally blew up and... ; Kbashed his head into the door. How do you like being back in Seoul? I still feel like I'm in a foreign country. But I guess coming back was the right thing to do. I've never lived alone in a strange place. You must've travelled around some, even if not alone. Yes, some. But I was always glad to get back home. I always take the same route, meet the same people. It seems the older I get, the less I want to try anything new. What's age got to do with it? It's desire that counts. Do you really think so? A lot of things come to a person by accident. I never thought I'd some back to Seoul to live. Who knows? Maybe in 10 years you'll be a worldly adventurer. I doubt that. It's very quiet and big, too. And there's a lake right in front. Are you sure it's not too far out of town? Well, I... I'm sure you know what you're doing. Could you put U-in on? Sure. Wait, Sis. What? Do you like him? Uh-huh. Of course, you would. We have the same taste in men. He's all alone. You take care of him for me till I get there. Not to worry. Hold on. Uh-huh, sure. Fine. I love you, too. Bye. We'd better start back to Seoul It's quite a ways. Here, take this. What is it? Something more interesting than the traffic statio I just listen to whatever's on. Thanks for all your trouble today. No trouble. What do you do with your evenings? Just lie around. Or play video games. How about coming up for tea or coffee? Next time, maybe. It's really nice. Did you talk to my father? Your father phoned my dad from the States and told him about it. Didn't you know you're father had bought you this apartment? Don't you like it? The one by the lake was really nice. That's my father way. He never asks me what I think. Just does as he likes. I had an older brother. He died in an accident 10 years ago. Ever since, Father's expected me to fill my brother's shoes. Even my job was my father's choice, not mine. Was there a different career you had you heart set on? Yes, there was. What was it? I'll tell you about some other time. We can bring the lake here. Here's your lake. It's your wedding present. In advance. Brazil? We emigrated there before we went to the U.S. Ji-hyon never mentioned that. I never told her. We lived there about five years. ; Kin a little town not far from Rio, by a lake. A lake as vast as the sea... I spent my days kicking a soccer ball around with the local kids. We'd get all hot and sweaty and then cool off in the lake. Sometimes I'd fall asleep and wake up to a beautiful sunset. The whole world would be awash in different shades of red. I wish you could see it. You'd like it. Anyway, that place... was different from anywhere else in the whole worl That was the happiest time of my life. That's why I've decided... After 40 I want to spend the rest of my life there Forty comes faster than you think. I didn't mean it that way... Brazil... for some reason it suits you. It seems so far away, and yet so familiar somehow. Sorry, honey. Did you bring all the stuff I asked Give me the shirt and tie. I've got more meetings... Can you wait? We could have lunch. That's all right. You're busy. But do you have to eat and sleep in the office, to You know how important this project is. It'll be over soon. Well, don't overwork yourself. Hello? Is there some; K I need to see about The furniture? Who's that? Ji-hyon's fiance. Looks like you're busy, too. I'll be home early tomorrow. I'll go get the papers Okay. What are you doing here? I followed you. Madam, would you sign this please? I'll get tickets. Hello? It's me, Sis. Everything's going okay? I tried you at home; K Are you with U-in, by any chance? Uh... no. Where could he be? If you hear from him, have him call me. How are the preparations coming? Everything's going okay. Sorry to put you through all this. I'll let you go. So long. It's starting to rain. I'm sorry. Let's just go. Aren't you going to come in? Who lived here before? I heard it was a potter's studio. There's a lotus pond on that side, and the Royal Hall is beyond it. It's really beautiful in the daytime. What's wrong? I was just imagining myself on an Amazon adventure Where exactly did you say you lived in Brazil? Campos. Tell me more about it. I told you about the lake, right? As big as the sea, you said. Why do you want to hear about Brazil? I think time must flow more slowly there. Get in out of the rain. You have excellent taste. You say it's your little sister who's getting marr Yes. She'll love what you've picked out. Oh, it must be civil defense drill day. Hello? Is that you, Ji-hyon? Sis? What's up? Do you know what time it is? Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. It's okay. Is there something wrong with dad. No, I just wanted to hear your voice. I worked late last night. You're sure nothing's wr Everything's fine. Go back to sleep. Will you get that? Yes. Go on. See you later. Is that you, honey? Yes, it's me. Why didn't you say anything? I forgot to tell you... Ji-hyon's fiance dropped by my office yesterday. I invited him over for dinner. I hope that's okay. Well, help yourself. Honey, sit down and join us. I'll eat later. So, you came from L.A.? Yes. I spent some time in New York. Never much cared for L.A. You work for your father's company? No, now I'm at Koryo Stone here in Seoul. Really? I know them well. They do a lot of work for us. Heir president and I were in the same class at sch Maybe I can put in the good word for you. Thank you. What're you doing, honey? Join us for a drink. All right. Pour your future sister-in-law a drink. Or is she supposed to pour for you first? I'm not sure what the proper etiquette is here. Anyway, you are part of the family now. You said you're 27, right? You look younger than your age. How did you say they met? We met in a museum. Oh, the National History Museum where Ji-hyon work Are you always this quiet? And how did you two meet? Us? So-hyon followed me all over the place-well, just kidding. Actually, I saw her in the library at school. I knew she was mine from that moment. A lot of guys were after her she gave us all the cold shoulder. So every morning I go there and sit next to her. She finally talked to me. Turned out to be a very warm person. Am I talking too much? Want to hear my story? It was love at first sight. There was no coldness between us. We hit it off right away, and soon we even kissed. Sometimes a kiss is just a way of greeting somebod It's nothing worth having a falling out about. Americans are more easy-going about such things. If the girl gets mad, you can say it was just a "good night" peck. Looks like you can hold your liquor. That's good in the business world. Are you happy? What? Are you drunk? Why would you ask that? Anyway, what's happiness? Look at that aquarium. Now, that's happiness. Nice warm water. Someone feeds you. Just swimming around, not a care in the world. Isn't that happiness? What do you think, honey? What? U-in wants to know if we're happy? Are you happy? Be careful. See you again soon. Thank you. Good night. Honey, would you see U-in out? I'm really bushed. I don't want to say I'm sorry for the other night. I'm not. Should I take care of finding someone to officiate And... Don't do this. Please. Why are you doing this? I'm you're fiance's sister Look at me! Do you see who I am? Come to bed. Hmm? Is he gone? Hello? Hello? Who the hell... Hello? It's me. Come downstairs for a minute. Why are you doing this? I'm going to wait till you come down. U-in? Why are you acting like this? You're soaking. See. I was right to wait. You did come down. Seeing you there like that, in your home... ...it bothered me. Do you love him? He's a good man. I asked if you love him. It's silly of you to like me. I'm too old for you. I have a child. Why do you like me? I'm too young. And I have no child. Is that you, ma'am? Could you turn that thing off? You'll call me, won't you? I'll be waiting. Hello? Could I speak with U-in, please? He called in sick today. It's me. Are you really sick? Are you still there? Are you there? I was afraid you'd left. Are you okay? What did you do while I was asleep? I just looked out at the Secret Garden. Your fever's gone down some. I'm not going on any more trips with those kids. What a drag! The scenery was really neat, though. Was it? Oh, Mom. Did you tape my program? What program? The cartoon movie. Oh, gosh, sweetie. I forgot. You didn't tape it? I'm sorry, Jin-su. Jeez, now I'll never know what happened! Hi! How's everybody? Let's begin the ancestral rites. Open the gate... Everyone come up and take a drink. Beaten...? By a mere woman? Do you know how to play any of these games? Want to try the race car? It's pretty easy. Where's the proprietor? I told him I'd close up for him. He went home earl He needs a nice young woman... No girlfriend at his age. Come off it! He's such a stick-in-the-mud. About the operation of our school buses... As you all know, we have five buses. Some of you have brought up problems with the scheduling. I think we should discuss this issue... Hi! How are you? Fancy running into you... way out here. I had some business to see to. I see. You hurt your arm? I slipped in the bathroom. I tried to catch my balance, but I fractured the arm. I hope it'll be all right. Will you sign my cast? Sure, why not? Now, your turn. How's Mr. Yun? Tell I said hi. I'll do that. Well, so long. I wish you could stay over just one night. Hello? How's traffic? U-in? How come you didn't answer? About what? I'm going to a construction site in the provinces tomorrow. Why don't you come along? I'm going to keep calling till you say you will. Where should I meet you? Hello? Hello? We got cut off. In a tunnel. Where are you? I tried the house but you weren't there. I'm in the car. What's with all this running around? Jin-su's not home, yet. Really? I'm almost there. Jin-su! You were here after all. Why didn't you answer the phone? I just didn't feel like it. This is U-in Lee of Koryo Stone. Please leave a message. What's with you? You look like you're somewhere else. Hmmm? Yu-jin... Is something wrong? It's nothing. Just a letdown after finishing that How about some coffee? No, let's get to work. Can't sleep? I went to bed early yesterday. I'll see you later. You'll be home today, won't yo You've got a temperature. Are you sure you'll be okay? I'm fine. I took the medicine. I'm a mess. Don't even look at me. You're pretty even when you're sick. U-in... U-in? U-in... Leave the lights off. How do you feel? Better now? I'm sorry. Hey, it's okay. I was sick, too, the other day. What did you do today? I took a walk. Just walked around a lot. A penny for your thoughts. Don't brood. Just clear your mind. Who's coming? What? I asked who's coming. Who's coming from the United States? It's Ji-hyon, isn't it? When did she call? Last night. Why didn't you tell me? I thought you knew. What did you talk about for such a long time? You wrote, erased, wrote over that, doodled... I've never seen Chairman Cho happier about anythin Now all that's left is my part of the job. I'm thinking of using grays for the interior. That sounds good. Yu-jin, how about if I stay over tonight? Suits me fine. I'm not joking. You haven't been yourself lately. I don't want to ruin a 20-year friendship... ...just to keep you from being lonely for one nigh Has something come between you and your wife? In some ways everything's the same as always, but. Is So-hyon all right? Why do you ask that? No special reason. I was just asking. So, that means you approve? And if I didn't, would you call it off? Of course, Dad. You're the most important man in m Flattery will get you nowhere, my dear. Now go get some sleep. You get some rest, too, Father. We'll be on our way. All right. Now, off with you. Good night, sir. Son. Yes, sir. Your parents will be coming soon. I wish I were in better shape. Thank you. I was worried about Ji-hyon. Take good care of her. Jun-il, I'm sorry. I'll just keep Sis here for tonight. Could you give U-in a lift? Sure thing. I won't need a ride. Thank you. Happy birthday! Oh, Jun-il! It's beautiful! Here's mine. It's a fossil. To complete your collection. Thanks, Ji-hyon. So how many fossils does that make now? Seven. Gee, Sis. That means you're already 38. You probably already know this, Ji-hyon, but... You shouldn't expect too much. Couples can't live on love alone. The passion eventually cools off. Then you realize your partner's just another human being. I don't buy that. I don't want to just grow old without any romance in my life. U-in! You started smoking again? Don't we make a nice couple? I pursuaded U-in father to send him back to Seoul. I hope you'll help him out, Jun-il. Me? Well... Just a second. I don't like to see you drunk. Jun-il, what are you doing after this? I have to go back to the office. Really? On such a nice day? I want to take U-in to meet some friends of mine t I thought maybe you and Jun-il would have plans of your own. I don't mean to leave you out. Don't worry about me. Jin-su will be waiting for m You're positive about that now, are you? It's not your place to pay. What's gotten into you today? My sister has been like a mother to me. Treat her properly, you hear? So this is where we're to live? Not bad... U-in said something strange last night. What was that? He wants to put the wedding off. Do you suppose he's getting cold feet? It's probably just temporary nerves, don't you think? I suppose so. Something has been bothering me every since I got back to Seoul. I can't quite put my finger on it, but... He's been acting different somehow. What do you think? It's very pretty. Hello? Where are you? You're father's fallen ill. Oh, no. Hurry. Get Ji-hyon and come to the hospital. Dad... remember what you said to me once. You'd had a little to drink, and you said... ...if you find someone you really love, don't let him go. No matter what others may think. Be selfish. I think I know why you said that. There was someone you let slip away from you, wasn't there? Dad, what should I do? I've fallen in love... ...for the first time in my life. At my age. Dad, what should I do? I love him so much it's frightening. I suppose I should give him up, shouldn't I? That's what I'll do. Otherwise I'll hurt too many people. Meeting someone you love doesn't always bring happiness. Especially when you can't be together. Is that why you gave up, Dad? Why you're dying alone like this? Why did I have to meet him now? U-in. We should not have done what we've done. I know. But I can't help myself. I'm not going to meet you any more like this. Is that so easy for you? Just like that? I've lived longer than you. So, now you're going to treat me like a child? It's just that I have other people I love more than you. Leave with Ji-hyon before this thing gets out of h I can think of nothing but you. Do you think I can marry Ji-hyon now? Then what are you going to do? I can't leave you. I'll stay near you even if it means marrying Ji-hyon. Stop it! I can't live with that kind of guilt. And I won't make Ji-hyon suffer any more than she has already. And what about us? Good-bye. Dad didn't live a happy life. I was hoping he'd live to walk me down the aisle. I was hoping he'd live to walk me down the aisle. Don't worry about it, Sis. We're putting it off. Not because of Dad's death. We both need more time... Some work has come up that will keep me busy for a while. When I'm done and U-in is ready, we'll go back to the States. We can have the wedding there with his folks. You'll come for it, won't you? Of course... Mom, it must be out of order. I'll walk down. Hi! Hi, Jin-su. Mom, we're next. Do a good job. It won't be easy. Our center's weak. You still have to do your best. I hate it when people say that! You're crazy... U-in Lee speaking. Hello? So-hyon? Where are you? I want to see you. We need to talk. Tell me where you are. I missed you. When I get to be your age, will I understand all this? No. Will I be even more confused? Time will move too fast for that. Like muddy water in the rain. Let's go away somewhere together. We can start a n Of course, you'll say no. You'll say you can't leave your son, your husband, your sister... They're all a part of me. I can't leave them. Can you really live without ever seeing me again? You're unbelievable. You don't even cry. I bet you can't say, "I love you." You've never sa You'll get old. No one will pay you any mind. You' You'll be sick with no one to tell you they love y And you won't have any more chances to love. Tell me you love me. U-in! Sorry I haven't called much. I've been busy. Everything okay? Uh-huh. Ji-hyon, I've wrapped everything up here. I'm going back to the States... alone. But why? I've fallen in love with someone else. She's not going with me, though. It's over. Someone; K you love? Where'd Jin-su go? He's at Kwang-ho's house. I'm sorry, but I'm leaving this house. Forgive me. I can't live like this any more. What are you talking about? I'm tired of fooling you. And I can't fool myself any longer, either. I can't act like nothing's happened. So, you just up and leave? Is that your solution? Couldn't you stop yourself? Why did you even bring it up? I never asked about Do you think it'll be any different that guy? You're not in your right mind! How can you be so cruel? What about Jin-su? Don't you even care about your sister's feelings? Sis, it was you? U-in and you? How could you do this to me? Your own sister! As far as I'm concerned, I don't have a sister any more. Hi. Do you have a reservation? No. Where are you going? Dad, I'm leaving now. I'll explain it all later. That's U-in Lee? Yes, here it is. You're going to Los Angeles? That's right. Just a moment, please. Here you are. Please board over there. Excuse me, but could you change my destination to Rio de Janeiro? Yes. Well, in any case you'd have to change flights in Here you go, sir.
