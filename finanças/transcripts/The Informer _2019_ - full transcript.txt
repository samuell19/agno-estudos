- Yeah. - 'The plane's leaving Miami.' 'Landing at 9 a.m. with six Ki's of fentanyl.' - 'Is the meeting confirmed?' - Looks like it. 'I need confirmation. Lots of strings to pull.' Yeah, tell me about it. - It's them. - 'Stay cool.' 'It'll all be alright.' Crazy Heaven Club. Looking for wife. You wanna join? Huh? Thanks, I got one already. Hey, listen... 'Why we never go out together, my brother?' 'Wh-why you don't have good time with me?' Hey, listen. Uh, the plane's landing at 9:00. So you gotta sober up, okay? All good? Six passengers. You're a fucking genius, man. Tomorrow we sit down with him. Six passengers would get my uncle's attention. Alright. Hey, girls, you tell him to go to bed. Okay? - You need to fucking sober up. - 'Ugh.' I'll pick you up in two hours, okay? I need you sharp. 'I was born sharp, my friend.' 'Born sharp as the fucking razor. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie. Was I talkin' too loud? You just tell him there's no bad words in the house. You're so right, baby. You're so right. Heh. Hey, hey, you know that camping trip that we were talking about before? - The one with me and mom? - Mm-hm. It's tonight. - Really? - Yeah. You wanna go wake up mommy? - Are you sure? - Yeah, go wake her up. Mom, wake up! Mommy, mommy, wake up! 'We're going camping!' It's happening. 'You got 20 minutes.' Just keep the lights off. - 'Yeah.' - Boss. Koslow is taking us to The General in the a.m. We're moving in. I sent you the ops plan and we need verbal approval. Give me a sec, Wilcox. - How many bodies you got? - 'Eleven.' 'Four surveillance, seven arrest team.' You did good. Koslow was your idea. 'You're gonna get credit for this.' 'Conquer.' - 'You're good to go.' - Thank you, boss. Alright, ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming. This is Ryszard Klimek. His gang known as Vojtech is one of the major importers and distributors of fentanyl. 'The new dope sensation among junkies' also known as Pink or synthetic heroin. We're going after him. We have a source inside. His top drug runner, who'll receive the drugs and take them to The General at his factory providing all the evidence we need to move in. Please make a visual note of our source. And when we move in, go easy on him. I'm gonna hand over to the tactical team leader for the layout of the meat factory and final brief back. Pete, I'm not gonna need that key. Hey. You don't open the door to anyone. And if I'm not back here by 1:00... Pete, stop it, I don't wanna hear this. 1 p.m., baby. Okay? You gotta promise me. This time tomorrow, we'll be on the road. All this will be over. Alright, same as usual. This is recording now and will be recording the whole time. All your private numbers are in there. Mother, Cousin Jackie, and dad, it's me. If I need to communicate, I will send you WhatsApp messages using one of these names. If I call you, don't be surprised, just answer. Right before you meet The General, they'll strip you of all electronics. This one needs to enter the room. - No. The wire's in place. - Today you need to wear mine. Hey, it's my ass that's gonna get pat down. The wire's in place. Alright, let's test it. You wanna turn around please? Of course, sorry. Oh, and if you feel your life is in danger ask to smoke a cigarette, we'll come get you. Okay? Might buy you more time. Yup. Done. Riley. Let's test it. Say something. Those Pollock's won't give a fuck if I wanna smoke a cigarette. 'Sounds great.' Alright, let's stamp it. Alright, it's June 12th, 2017, at 0500 hours. This is FBI special agent Erica Wilcox. The following recording will be a cooperating witness 1-2-4-5 X-Ray-8 regarding case number 9-Alpha-N-Y-1-4-5-7-7-4. The recording will be a consensually recorded meeting between C-W-1-2-4-5-X-Ray-8 and Stazek Kuzek and Ryszard Klimek. - There's our man? - Good. Jeez, guys. A bit obvious in that damn van. Okay, guys, we gotta go. The parade is moving. Let's stop at liquor store. Uh, I wanna buy a bottle to my uncle, okay? My God. This guy has no clue. Whitey Fisk, do you know him? - Yeah, we did time. - Trust him? Yeah, he's a straight guy. Why? We have a buyer. We're going to Techniska Bar. Wait, wait, wait.. What do you mean, you got a buyer? How'd you find him? I checked. He's good. Fuck. I really want to see my uncle face when we show up with cash. Jesus Christ. My cousin's one annoying bitch. Hook me up. You don't want any of that.. Her face.. It's a problem, believe me. He needs to stick to the plan. He'll fuck everything up. What, we follow the Little Poland? Guys, there's been a change of plans. Source was ordered to take drugs to a buyer on his way to Klimek. 'Okay, if the exchange takes place' 'arrest the buyer, recover narcotics.' Copy that. We follow the Little Poland. 'Guys, we follow, you stay close by.' 'Copy that.' Sit here. I'll take think everything you got, cabron. - Whatever we've got? - Yeah, that's right. 'All of it.' What are we talking about? Hmm? You got a half Ki, or a Ki, okay. Six. Motherfucker, six Ki's? You got a bunch of Polacks walking around with six fucking Ki's of fentanyl? I fuckin' love it. Y'all niggers crazy, man. I ain't got the cash for six, but I'mma get that shit though. You're not good for six? No, no, no. I-I'm good. I'm good for three, okay? Just give me a couple hours. I'll bring back the cash. Bam. Huh? Relax. I'm cool, Polack. You look a little nervous. Are you the money guy? Hmm? You guys want the fuckin' money or no? Three Ki's, it's 85k. Yeah, I can fuckin' count. You'll get that in two hours? I guess you motherfuckers don't know who the fuck I am, huh? - No. I don't know who you are. - Ah. You did time at Bale Hill? - That's right. - Whitey Fisk? Yeah, 0-5-2-0-9. - Ah, I did time in Bale Hill. - Oh, yeah? Whitey, he was over there in section three, right? D section. Right? 'Cause they don't got numbers, they got letters up there. Who else you do time with? Well, fuck you guys. Fine. Fine, just give me half a Ki. I'm good for that right now. Fuck it. I thought you said you want three? Yeah, I want half a Ki now. Hmm. What the fuck is his problem, man? His problem is you didn't answer my question. Yeah, question is that, cabron? Who else you do time with? Kantro and Delray, and go fuck yourself. - Go fuck myself? - That's right. Delray he's murdered. And Kantro, he's scratchin' walls up in Austin County Mental which means that you picked two guys we can't check on. What the fuck are you tryin' to say? I'mma ask you one more time. How the fuck is a spic junkie gonna raise 85k in two hours? Spic junkie, huh? You got a nasty fuckin' mouth, you know that? You don't even know me, man. You a cop? Fuck you. I'm no fucking cop. How can you say that, man? You're a cop. 'Fuck you.' 'If these guys find out you're a cop' 'you're a dead man. You understand?' 'Stop saying I'm a fuckin' cop.' 'It's a serious accusation, homie.' 'You'll die here tonight.' Who are you, cabron? I'm a drug dealer, you dumb fuck. 'But I don't wanna go down for being a cop killer.' - How far is rescue? - Five to seven. Call them, now. Move it in, guys. Yeah, now. Put your money back. Put your fuckin' money in your pocket. Fuck it. You guys don't want my money, fuck you then. You got one chance. And I'm gonna give it to you in a few seconds. You fuckin' understand me? Get the fuck outta here. Can you believe this fuckin' guy? You waste my time again, I'll fuckin' kill you. - Ooh! - Don't fuckin' touch me, huh? I said get the fuck outta here. Unh! It's no deal. Fuck you. Fuck you. Waste my time again, I'm gonna fuckin' kill you. Hey! Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! Alright? 'Yo, freeze. Put your fucking hands up.' Hands where I can see them. NYPD. Chill the fuck out. You too, motherfucker. I'm wired fuck. Huh? - What the fuck? - 'Whoo-hoo-hoo.' Burrito on the floor. Don't.. Fuck, fuck. You don't fucking kill cops in New York. Get some garbage bag. Come on. 'You need to clean this shit.' Gotta smoke a cigarette. Call off rescue. Let's make this fucking car disappear. SO is two minutes away. 'You're smoking now?' A cop just got killed. Call them off. Calling it off, guys. What the fuck are you looking for, man? Come on. I need you inside. Get up. Hey. Okay. When did you understand the buyer was a cop? Earlier in the conversation. Well, I thought he was a rookie who.. ...got into more than he can handle, I don't know. I felt he might take advantage if I gave him an exit. You thought by kicking and pushing him to the ground he would take advantage of such polite exit? I-I was trying to avoid bigger problems for Vojtech. An NYPD cop just got killed in New York. Do you know what that means, Piotr? 'Bad business.' 'They will shut down all illegal activities' 'until they find their cop killer.' 'Now, Stazek doesn't have documents' because Stazek doesn't exist but you? NYPD will come for you. 'The best drug runner in Vojtech.' Oh, Piotr.. This is bad business for me. I'm sorry, Mr. Klimek. Oh, no. Don't be sorry. That feeling doesn't take us anywhere. We were talking about business here. Please, sit down. Stazek tells me that the cop was pointing the gun i-in your face. Correct? So, Stazek saved your life. You now owe the price of your life to Vojtech. How much is your life worth? I don't know. Two words. Closed market. Bale Hill is a holding unit. It sends prisoners all over the state. Hub. We control the product inside the Hill. We control the supply to prisons all over New York. You did four years at Bale Hill, right? So if anyone can get drugs inside that's, that's you? You, you want me to control the supply inside.. I mean, how would I do that? Oh, you're a resourceful man. With fentanyl, we can have tens of thousands hooked on our product. They will work off their debts to Vojtech. Not only in prison, but afterwards on the street. I will own a fucking army. You'll break your parole. My lawyers will convince the judge to send you back to Bale Hill. With good behavior, you'll be released in five years max and our debt will be extinguished. My life ain't worth that much. How much are the lives of your wife and daughter worth to you? 'We found them' 'driving around your house.' So frightened. Suitcase filled with clothes. You informed them what happened at Techniska. I-I just, I told them to get out of the house. Where-where are they? 'Outside.' 'Waiting for you.' Oh, don't worry. Sofia and Anna will be okay.. ...while you're inside. Now.. ...fuck off. 'You safe?' You guys left me in the fuckin' lurch. You were supposed to take us directly to The General. 'I can't call those shots.' I'm only a soldier. I do what I'm told. You understand? Only a soldier? You just brought in six Ki's for them. It would've raised suspicion. They would've stripped me naked. 'Look, meet me tonight and hope we can' salvage something, otherwise four years of hard work just went down the fuckin' drain. What the fuck you talkin' about.. Are you fuck.. 'Anna, do you wanna come and play?' Do you wanna go play with Nina? - Listen, sweetie... - She's fine. Don't, now. 'I can see you.' - 'Hi.' - 'Hi, Nina, You wanna play?' - Yeah. - Go ahead. - Come on. - Go the the backyard. Why didn't you do what I fuckin' told you to? Just one sec. Why didn't you fuckin' leave? Pete, you've got blood all over you. Answer my question. Why didn't you protect Anna? I wanna know what's going on. Why didn't you protect Anna? - I'm sorry, I'm... - I don't wanna hear sorry. I don't wanna hear fuckin' sorry. You were supposed to take Anna away from there, 1 p.m. You think these people would have a fuckin' problem in killing the both of you? We tried. We fuckin' tried! We kept driving around the block hoping you'd be back. Fuck you! Come on. Yeah-hoo-hoo! Driver's license says it's Carlos Harrera. His real name was Daniel Gomez. Who the fuck are you? Detective Edward Grens, organized crime. - He was one of mine. - 'What happened here?' He was supposed to be a low-level buy off the street tip. They cut his throat, pulled out his tongue. They knew he was a cop. 'What'd you say his name was?' - Hey. - Hey. Thanks for takin' me here. It's so romantic of you. Yeah, dig in. Shut up and eat, girl. Homicide talk about anything? Like what? I think Daniel's connection was Polish. Entire NYPD force in this manhunt. You don't see to sharing this little fuckin' detail? I gotta check my sources before they get spooked by the stampede. You heard of Ryszard Klimek, aka "The General." Hmm. Polish crime boss, right? Came over from Poland after serving 20 years in some shithole Eastern European dungeon. Now he's moving pieces all over the board. You think he has something to do with Daniel? Gomez was killed in this bar in Little Poland. 'It's impossible to trace its owners' 'the street's link it to The General.' 'Security cameras across the street record Gomez' entering at 11:09, then at 11:27 this guy pops up. Look at his body language. This is a man who's just done bad. - What do you need? - Your badge. IAS comin' after me. Christ, Eddie. I sent a man when he wasn't ready. This is on me. Hold on a second. Watch my six. That girl over there was Daniel's source. Shit. Shit. Help, help, help, help, help! 'I'll give anyone $20 who stops the puto behind me!' - Whoa! - Help me out! Help me out! - 'Move! Nigga, move!' - Hold on. NYPD! Get the fuck back! Tell me what happened to Daniel? Tell me what happened to Daniel? - Daniel... - I don't know nothin'! Okay? You got Gomez killed. Hey, Grens, you wanna talk to me for a second? Hey, Ed. Hey, Eddie, you wanna talk to me outside? Ed, outside, please? Right now. Ed? You're gonna be down. What are you doing? You wanna get these motherfuckers? Oh, this bitch better talk. You are scaring the shit out of her. You wanna calm down, you wanna be professional and let me do this, alright? - Do what you gotta do. - You stay here. Hey, honey, you wanna scooch over for a second please? Stazek carved him up like that? You think I'd fuckin' do that? I'm just trying to find a professional way to say this. - Say what? - You're fucked, Koslow. - Wait, who the fuck is he? - 'He's my boss.' We tried to close the case on The General and bury this whole mess. But Washington labelled the case as weak and took the embassy off the table. W-w-with all due respect, sir, what the fuck you talkin' about taking the embassy off the table? You just watched me smuggle a dozen Ki's through Polish diplomatic pouches. Deal was to give you enough evidence so you could indict The General, which I have fuckin' over-delivered at this point. 'Look, I've done my part.' I-I want out. Agent Wilcox here has a plan to keep your status alive. You should listen to her and hope I like it 'cause in my book, you're old news, my friend. 'Pete, I think there's a way out of this.' We go along with The General's plan. Evidence of fentanyl being methodically distributed inside a state prison buries Ryszard Klimek for good. And if that happens, you're a free man. The fuck you talking about? Go back to prison? That was never part of the plan. And where is the part of the plan where you become an accessory to the murder of an undercover policeman? How am I an accessory when I try to help him? I mean, it's all on the tape. And you guys put me there. If I inform the NYPD that I'm working with a witness to Officer Daniel Gomez's murder you will be exposed. If you're exposed, General's case falls apart. If I say no? Prosecutor will have you serve the remaining twelve years of your sentence and then tack on whatever the NYPD pins on you. Some fuckin' bullshit. I tried to help him. You're a convicted felon who was present when one of their own was nearly beheaded. You should think of your family, Pete. Look, once you're in charge like The General wants you just build a list of all the inmates and COs distributing for him. 'Everyone's a potential nail to crucify' 'that son of a bitch.' I need to know you're in. And let me guess, if I fuck up and bail then I'm alone, right? Don't fuck up. 'Look, once you're in charge, like The General wants' 'you just build a list of all the inmates' 'and COs distributing for him.' 'Everyone's a potential nail to crucify that son of a bitch.' 'I need to know you're in.' 'And let me guess, if I fuck up and bail' 'then I'm alone, right?' 'Don't fuck up.' 'Yeah. Thank you.' 'Alright. Thank you.' Yeah. Thank you. Buh-bye. Buh-bye. Okay. Got a couple hits on the names. First's a Pole, street name's Stazek. Real name unknown, whereabouts unknown. Unfortunately, that's it on him. He was probably recently imported. Well, what about the American? This is where it gets interesting. - Peter Koslow, he's a.. - What? "Complex. Born here, parents immigrated from Poland. "Gulf War vet, sniper. "Served an additional four tours in Iraq. "Medals, medical history, post-traumatic stress disorder.. "Crashed and burned a few years ago. "Manslaughter, got 20 years for killing a guy in a bar fight. - Then it's weird. - Weird, how? Well, the file looks like it's been redacted. "Paroled from Bale Hill after four pending the full investigation of new evidence." Doesn't add up though. Well, who could fuck with his jacket like that. Feds is my guess. Can you dig into this Fed angle? You can't just fuckin' poke around the Feds like they're one of your junkie hookers, Grens. Look, I-I think this is the guy who shot Daniel. You said Bale Hill, right? Bale Hill was part of Daniel's cover story. He liked it because his old man served time there but that was years ago, if this guy was fresh out he could've tripped the kid up on something. Let me see what I can do. Oh, shit. Got a breakfast date with my sweetheart. Wait, this guy you're runnin' to, is this somebody special? You jealous? I'm just hoping his name ain't fucking Logan or-or Chad or Brett. Laila. Her name is Laila. Laila? Kat, why didn't you tell me that? La.. Yo, I-I should come with you and Laila! Y'all want a chaperone? - What are you doing here? - We have to talk. Important stuff. Don't ever come knocking on my fuckin' door. Go to the garage. All night awake, fuck! What happened? I had to do some sweeping. They guy you did time with. - Whitey? - Yeah, Whitey. We found him 30 minutes ago. Why don't you fuckin' listen to me? I told you, the cop just used his name. He's a straight guy. You can complain to my uncle. He wants to see you. - Your wife good cook? - Why? It's an old tradition to invite boss home before prison. You sell two of this to break your parole. Rest until Bale Hill. Yeah, I still gotta figure out a way outta here. Figure it out fast, Piotr. Detective sniffing around Little Poland. Monday you need to be inside. Kalash told me you went out last night, motherfucker. Where did you go? It's none of your fuckin' business. Come on, I want to know. Where did you go? My wife's next door. You have kurba? She good fun? Huh? Who is she? Come on, tell me, you mind if I bonk her a while when you're inside? You touch any of my things when I'm inside and I'll carve your fuckin' eyes out. When? Tomorrow? In a month? When? Two days. If you go back inside, you'll never get out. You know that, do you? Are you happy to spend the day with daddy? Uh-hmm. What are you doing? You see that down there? That's where I'll be going on my business trip. But I don't want you to go. I know, sweetie, but what if I told you this was the last time. Okay. Gotta go. New warden's name is James Leonard. He's been briefed. You give him the list, he'll put you in solitary and then in 24 hours the appellate court judge will put you back on the streets. Daddy, you're too loud. I can't hear my movie. Uh, I know. I'm sorry, sweetie. Yeah, j-just watch your movie. Sofia and Anna will be in a FBI safe house before Klimek evens knows what happened. You have my absolute word on that. Uh, look, um, I'm gonna need three favors. First, I'll need a major drug sweep day after I get there to dry up the competition. And second, have, uh, Warden Leonard.. ...put me on program post detail. And third, in six days.. ...courier these beautiful yellow wonders to a Deputy Superintendent Reseda Johnson compliments of the bureau so the prison receives them on Founders' Day. And, there's got to be a government seal on the package... I can't do this, Pete. You know, if the prosecutor finds out that I helped people get high, he'll destroy me, you, and the case. You.. You gotta fuckin' help me out here. I can't do it. It won't come through, if it don't come from you guys. Hmm. Have Leonard assign me to roof and yard maintenance. That I'll do, the drug sweep I'll also do but the rest you're on your own. How's Sofia holdin' up? Just fuckin' great. - I'm sorry. I gotta take this. - Yeah. One second, boss. I gotta go. You'll be fine. Pete, you should have told me we have friends coming tonight. They brought me so many presents to keep me comfortable when you're away. You have such an adorable wife, Piotr. - Beata. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. 'We should get this little creature in bed' then we can celebrate. Let's go. I will help. - It's okay, I got it. - No, no, no, no. Please. Piotr, I insist. 'After you.' I don't have kids, Pete. I regret it. Must be wonderful. It is. Beata wants them, but I'm afraid.. I would suffer too much if something happened to them. Imagine someone hurts them. In the honor of bravery of Pete's, his courageous wife here is a Polish song entitled "I Used To Be A Rose" which talks about the love we give to our partners. - Na Zdrowie. - Na Zdrowie. Na Zdrowie. - Bye. - Bye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Yeah. You need more reason to dig? The General just left the Koslow residence. Honey, you want to go to the zoo or not? Let's go to the zoo, come on. 'We'll be back in a couple of hours.' - Okay. - Be a good girl, okay? You know daddy loves you very much. I know. Can I go now? - 'Anna, come on!' - Pete? Pete, come on. Give me a kiss, eh? - Mwah! - See you later, guys. - Bye! Have fun. - Bye! Love you! - Send me photos! - 'Yeah, of course!' Those kids with a drone. Better call them today. Pete, don't worry. I don't want you to worry. - I'll take care of it. - You still got the key? It's right here. It's gonna be fine. '911, what's your emergency?' Please, I need help. My husband's going crazy! He wants to kill me. Please send someone fast! 'Just hold it right now, ma'am.' 'Ma'am, is he armed?' 'Do you have any children in the house?' Please send someone fast. Second time around, huh? I want you to stand right there for me. Oh, what language is that? I don't know. I was drunk when I did it. Maybe Chinese or something. You're not gonna tell me, huh? 'Okay, now show me your arms.' - Are you affiliated? - He is. Last term you become a courier on behalf of the Poles. Look at you. They gave you the white shirts, Slewitt. - His bed been assigned? - Not yet. I got this. Welcome back, Koslow. Let them know he's here. Follow me. Stand right there. Okay! Hey! Come here, boy! Yeah, you see me talking to you! Don't walk away from me! Hey! Hey! Pssh! - Mornin'. - Mornin', boss. Mornin', gentlemen. One time, one time! Wake up, sleepyhead. Hey, big man. Carlos. Hey, yo, fellas! Looks like we got us a new white boy. - What up, Slewitt? - Smiley, this is Koslow. Your new celley. Try to make him feel at home. Hey, don't be scared. They'll be gentle. Won't you, boys? The Prodigal Son returns. I need two extra mats. You and you, roll it up. It's your lucky day, dickheads.. Each and every business that takes places under the roof of this facility runs through me. Comply or I crucify you. - Get back to your block. - Yes, sir. 'Rise and shine, ladies!' It's time to get the fuck off. Name? Koslow, Pete. Previous term you kept yourself busy, huh? Roofing, HVAC maintenance? We should get you on the program, Mr. Koslow. I appreciate that, warden. Name? That guy. - This guy. - Hands up. Legs spread. - 'Next. Hey.' - 'You.' 'This dumb fuck.' They swept the whole place.. Bone-dry. That's a lucky break for us. Product will be here soon. Under the table. - Who? - K-O-S-L-O-W. Comma Peter. - I'm sorry, I don't... - Uh, don't apologize. Me, I'm old-school, I knock on doors get-right-there-in-your-face type of cop. Wilcox, we gotta go. Sorry. You are? Detective Edward Grens from the NYPD. - Everything good? - Yeah. We're just having a conversation about somebody named Peter Koslow. 'Decorated vet.' Driver slash security for the Polish Consulate. Fast-tracked almost smells like a bogus parole violation. Back into Bale Hill. Same prison he was serving 20 years for murder before somebody pulled him out pending the investigation of new evidence. Anyway, I want to know why your subordinate's name keeps popping up around this admittedly suspicious motherfuckin' file. I'm sure that, uh, Agent Wilcox's name pops up on a number of case files, detective. You should check with the DEA. They just sent me here. 'Look, if I was involved in the kind of pro-active operation' that you are suggesting, I would be intimately acquainted with, uh, Peter, what was his name again? Koslow. - Koslow. - Hmm. Our organizations may not see eye-to-eye, detective but we've extended you every professional courtesy we can. There's Koslow right after Gomez was killed. That Prius screamin', "We're the FBI!" 'That's y'all leaving the scene.' And here, even though this picture may be hard to read that person looks very much like you, Agent Wilcox.. ...drivin' away from the crime scene. You want to pitch your field office against the biggest police department in the world? Let's do it. We love us a good fight. Have a good day. What perfume you wear? Smells expensive. Alright. Now, get this shit cleaned up. 'Okay, that's enough.' 'It must be tough on you.' - We'll get through it. - 'Like you did the last time?' I checked the old visitor logs at Bale Hill. You and Anna never missed a visitors' day. That's how you kept him strong, huh? You let him see how much he had to lose. What do you want? Someone killed a friend of mine. I used to think your husband did it but now I'm not so sure. This FBI thing has gotten me thinkin' otherwise. Look, I'm here to help your husband. But you got to give me something to work with. You know, five years ago we walked into a bar looking for a jump start for our car. Some bikers inside started making comments about me so Pete asked them to stop and then he was fighting three of them. That night I went from being the wife of a great father and a loving husband to the wife of a convict killer. And since then, every time someone tells us they wanna help they end up doing the exact opposite. So unless you wanna buy something.. With all due respect to you and the NYPD get the fuck out of my store. I'm not like all the others, Mrs. Koslow. I hope you don't learn that the hard way. Stay safe out here. And here we go. Let him through. 'The Knicks hardly get that exciting, huh?' Who's this? Motherfucker, I'm the hangman. And I just put a tight noose around your neck. In a few hours, you're gonna be alone on this yard it'll be the scariest moment of your life. 'Your only way out is that man in front of you.' 'His name is Vermin.' 'When you're ready to talk about Officer Gomez's murder' 'tell Vermin to call the hangman.' Here I am, dead man. Present and fucking accounted for. We need to talk. I got a fuckin' present for you. Why're you selling fuckin' product on my patch. To get your attention. You have it. I don't think it's on you want. Slewitt. That's for not respecting the system. That's for not following our rules. Smiley, listen, listen, listen. Please, listen! You gotta listen to me. I'm here to take out The General. I'm here to take out The General. I need, I need his Bale Hill distribution chain. I need all the names. I need all the names. I'll take him down. I'll fucking help you.. Make it look like a suicide. Clean up after you're done. You think Mick is important? Six Ki's of fentanyl per week. What are those names for? What are those names for? I'm a... snitch. I'm a snitch. Let him down. It's their fault, Ben. Are you alright, dead man? You're a snitch? I made a deal with the Feds to take down The General. Look, you're on top now. But The General's coming for you harder than ever. If you gimme that list I'll bury that Polish cocksucker. That's all, huh? So, what's it gonna be? If you're alive in three hours.. ...you fuckin' own my ass. You can wait here. Grens went to Bale Hill. Shit. - I'm sure Leonard blocked him. - He did. But it's only a matter of time before he gets to Koslow. He's already got Washington on the fucking phone asking me why an NYPD cop is trying to subpoena a file on an FBI informant who shouldn't exist. Look, we just need to stall a few days. Koslow is so close to delivering and then it won't matter. What? What are you thinking? - Burn him. - No. He has a family, I mean, we, you can't make this call. The Bureau can't afford the luxury of your precious feelings right now. We looked him in the eyes. We made him guarantees. You took a convicted killer out of prison you run him off the books and you stuck him in a room where a cop was murdered. If you don't see how this is about to blow the fuck up and tear you apart with it.. ...you're not the agent I thought you were. How fucking dare you? I was operating under your authority. You will not throw me under the fucking bus if I don't burn an innocent man. I don't have to throw you under the bus. I didn't know anything about this operation. You were trying to impress a superior and you went too far. We'll make an example of you. You will serve jail-time. I guarantee it. You know, I started on this floor 23 years ago. My desk was right there. Burn him. It's an order. I had you, white boy. Smiley Phelps was right behind you. Like a nigger angel. Mmm. Hey, warden? I just wanna shake your hand. Come on, leave the warden alone. Oh, no, it's okay. I just wanna thank you and congratulate you for running this place the right way. I now request a solitary. I can't do that, Pete. If you leave me out here, I'm a fuckin' dead man. I'm sorry, Pete, they were very clear. Who was clear? Look, this wasn't the deal. Just get Wilcox here right now. Escort the inmate back to his block. - Yes, sir. - Lenon, Lenon? Come back here. 'Come on.' Time is up! Come on, guys. Get off the phones. Next in line. Six minutes. - Wilcox. - It's me. Hey, it's me. I did it. I drew you the picture. 'Why aren't you sayin' anything?' I did what you told me, and I drew the picture and now I need to show it to you. 'I need to show it to you right now.' You promised you'd come see it. You fuckin' promised. 'Fuck, you did!' 'Hello?' Hello? Hello? Eh, eh, how much time I got? Two minutes and 15 seconds. - Hello? - 'It's me.' Pete? Are you okay? The key, you gotta use it right now. Why? They fucked me. - I'm not gettin' out of this. - 'No, no. You shut up.' 'You listen to me.' There is a detective. He, he asked about the dead cop. He knows about the FBI, okay? 'You don't fucking give up now.' Okay. Alright. Give him the tapes. Tell him there's information about Daniel Gomez. He'll know what to do, but you gotta you gotta make him promise to protect you too. 'You gotta do it right now. You and Anna you ain't safe.' 'You gotta get outta the house right now.' 'Okay, baby. You gotta get out of the house right now.' Promise me. Promise me right now, okay? - Now. - 'I promise you.' 'Time is up!' Pete. I have some information that might interest your biggest client. Move away from that box. Sit on the chair. How'd you find me? Your phone. We heard everything. We tracked you here. Now, you and Anna need to get off the grid. You need to go somewhere the Pols won't find you. Take those tapes and get the fuck out of our lives. What the fuck you talkin' about? Go back to prison? That was never part of the plan. 'How am I an accessory when I try to help him?' 'It's all on the tape and you guys put me there.' 'If I inform the NYPD that we're working' 'with a witness to Officer Daniel Gomez's murder' 'you'll..' 'I was always close by, Pete.' 'I was never gonna let anything happen to you.' 'How's Sofia holding up?' 'You just scared my daughter.' 'Stop trustin' me..' 'Sofia and Anna will be in a FBI safe house' 'before Klimek even knows what happened.' 'You have my absolute word on that.' Your time is closer. Get the fuck back. Stay the fuck back. Stay back. - Back the fuck off. - Everybody, on your knees! Face the wall! Hands on the wall! - Back the fuck up. - On your knees! - Face the wall. Hands on wall. - 'Stay right there.' I'm gonna run this in his fucking brain. Back the fuck up! Just take me to talk to your boss. Koslow, tell him. Don't do anything stupid now. Get the fuck back. Back off! I will kill him right now. Back the fuck off. Back the fuck off. Do what he fucking says! Just stay away from him. Stay down there. Stay down there. Get the fuck away. Get the fuck over there. It's okay. We're here.. I'll drive this into his fucking brain. You hear what I'm saying? - Get the fuck over there. - Ah! I will fucking kill him right here. 'Back the fuck up.' It's alright. You tell Lenon, I wanna talk to the press. I want a phone to call my wife. He's got 15 minutes to comply or I'm gonna fucking kill this guy. - Take it easy. - Gimme the keys. Stay there. You stay right there. - What color? - Black. What color's the next door? Ah! Blue. You fucking.. I think we should put, um, the.. Girls, don't leave the bikes outside. - Take them in the backyard. - Okay, mom. Thanks so much, sweetie. The biggest prophet must be out.. - Czesc. - Hi. You're so sweet. Anna. Anna, come with me. What the fu.. What the fuck are you doing here? Go inside. Go inside. Get away from us. Fuck you. 'Ms. Koslow?' 'Ms. Koslow? Ms. Koslow, is that you?' Surprise. 'Ms. Koslow?' Everything is ready, sir. - Hey. - I just got word from Leonard. Koslow has taken a hostage. - He wants to talk to the press. - 'I know.' 'Aideg has granted me his authority.' I'm going out there. This ends now. NYPD, freeze! Where are they? Stand up. Shut up or I'm gonna kill her. Shut up. Now, we're gonna play a game, okay? Where is he? 'Where's our friend?' Sit down. I will cut your tongue out like I did with your friend. 'Hey, Jim, federal authorities are still proceeding' 'local chains of command.' '10-9, federal authorities are still proceeding' 'local chains of command. Over.' 'Local authorities are coming in.' Get ready. Move! Move! Move! Get back. Get back. 'Lead two moving into position.' 'Hey, Pete?' 'Pete?' 'It's only me.' 'Everything's cool.' I got the phone so you can call your wife. Welcome. Ray Barnes, H-I-T supervisor. Get me up-to-date. Where are we? Inmate Koslow is holding CO Slewitt up there in the HVAC room. There are three shooters in position. One to the north. We got two more. South of these towers. They're the one with eyes. What decision do I need to make in the next five minutes? Well, right now we're buying time. Breach will be through in 15 minutes. H-S still stuck in the traffic. 'Warden Lenon is giving Koslow one of our phones' so that he can call his family. If he calls the press, cut the call. Copy that. - Hello. - Hey, Sofia, it's me. 'Baby, what's happening?' Hey, baby, are you safe? Tell me what's happening? Everything is gonna be alright, sweetheart. Just, I got this. Don't worry. Are you and Anna safe? 'Yes, we're safe. We're safe.' Um, Anna's here, you wanna talk to her? - 'Alright, put her on.' - Yes. Talk to your dad. Are you coming home, daddy? I'm trying, my love. I'm trying. It's just, uh, I got held up here. But, um... Please, daddy, come back home. I'm scared. I'm trying, my love. I'm doing everything I can to get home to you as soon as I can. I just, I just want to tell you that. Daddy loves you very much. I love you very much. Cut the call. Put mommy back on. Babe.. 'I have a visual of inmate with a shiv' 'in the officer's throat.' Reds, what you got? 'Zero movement, sir..' - Three? - 'Negative, sir.' 'Lost the visual.' Slewitt. Wake up. Hey? God dammit! What the fuck is he doing? Come on. What the fuck? There you go. - Come on. - Hah! That's all you got? That's all you got? Red 3, you have the shot? 'Negative. No clean strike.' 'Repeat, no clean strike.' 'I have a clean shot.' 'Repeat, I have a clean shot.' - Hostage's clear. - You're clear hot. 'We got a survivor.' We got somebody. Let's go. Give me an ID on the survivor. I need an ID on the survivor. 'Slewitt.

You cuff yourself to his leg. I recognized him on the stretcher. Where is he? In a motel upstate. Address? If you shield me from the O-P-R investigation on the Gomez murder...
