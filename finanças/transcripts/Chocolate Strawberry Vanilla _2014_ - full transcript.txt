[Waiting for a Train by Jimmie Rodgers] # All around the water tank # Waiting for a train # A thousand miles away from home, # Sleeping in the rain # I walked up to a brakeman # To give him a line of talk # He said "If you got money" # I'll see that you don't walk You won't have to walk # I haven't got a nickel # Not a penny can I show # "Get off, get off, you railroad bum" # And slammed the boxcar door Roger, I'll never forget you. You were always there for me. A true friend to the end. No words could sum up the heartbreak I feel. I remember when I went to the pet shop to get you. I liked another kitten in the box. But you were crying and you wanted me. You were a great companion all these years. I love you, Roger. I'm sorry I ran over you. You okay, Dylan? I'm okay, Warren. I'm good. What flavor? Chocolate. What's that supposed to mean? You know what it means. Can I get one single serve of chocolate please? Cup or cone? Cone, thanks. Thanks. What do I owe you, mate? That's $2.90. There you go. Is it good? No. Shit. Hey mate, you got something on your tire. Where? Just here man. It's Roger. I'm sorry, what? My cat. I accidentally killed him. I'm really sorry. Are you okay?

There will be a death on the block that will shock you to your core. Weeknights at 7. Hi, Ruby. Hey, Warren. Hey, I've been thinking about it, and I'd like to buy one of those cameras, please. Okay, cool. Any particular one? One that does video. Yep, no worries Hey, you'll never guess what happened to me today. What? Katie George came to my van and I spoke to her and she had an ice cream. Do you have honeycomb? Just a scoop of that, thanks. I really love your show. I watch it every night. Really? Yeah, and I hope you find Ralph. The show wouldn't be the same without him. Who's Katie George? Katie George. I have no idea who that is. Do you watch 'Round the Block? What, the TV show? Yeah. No, I don't watch that crap. It's not crap. Sorry. It's my favorite show. And Katie George plays Stacey, and that's my favorite character. Cool. Well don't you think that's crazy? My favorite character coming to my van to have ice cream? Yeah. Pretty cool, I guess. Hi. Hi, I'm Warren Thompson and today the most amazing thing happened. The love of my life came to my van. Everybody has someone they worship. Whether it's an actor or a singer, Everybody has someone they love like a soulmate and for me it's Katie George. I bought this camera so I could document when, well, if, she ever comes back. I thought we had a real connection. I love you Katie George and I'm gonna make you mine. This is Warren, signing out. I'll never forgive Slug if anything happens to dad. You know what Slug's like. He's just a teenager. Yeah, but he's always in and out of our lives, ruining everything. I've had it with him. Look. Dad. Ralph! It's okay, doll. I'm sorry I left. After Slug went, I just couldn't face you. It's okay, sweetheart. We can work through this. We are here for you. Come here, son. I love you, dad. I love you too, son. Okay, so, it's the day after Katie George came into my life. It's a beautiful day outside. Good day for ice cream. I hope she comes back. We've got so much to talk about. Last night's show was a genuine cliffhanger. I want to tell her how good she was. She probably gets that all the time. You know, Katie's a lot like Stacey in real life. They're both beautiful. They're both friendly. I'd really love to talk to her again. I've got so many questions I want to ask her. Like, what's her favorite food? Her favorite movies? Does she like Clint Eastwood? Does she have a boyfriend? Anyway, I better be off now. Fingers crossed. You want an ice cream, sweetie? Yeah. What kind do you want? Strawberry. Okay. Hi. Can I get a one scoop cone of strawberry, thanks? Cone? When are we meeting dad? We're gonna go and see him now, sweetie. That's $2.90. Warren? Yeah? Warren Thompson? Amanda. Yeah. Long time, no see? Yeah. So, how ya been? Not bad. Yourself? Busy. So, you got kids? No. Married? No. Just been busy working? Pretty much. Who's that. This is Warren. Warren and I used to be good friends. Was he your boyfriend? Sorry. It's okay. Well, we better get going. It was nice seeing you. Yeah, same. Stay safe. Yeah, you too. See ya. Bye. Hey. Sorry, I didn't see ya there. How can I help you? Single scoop of vanilla. Okay. That's $2.90. With nuts. $3.70. Hey. I waited until 10 o'clock for her to come. But she didn't come. Maybe she was too busy. Or maybe she was in filming. She said that she liked my ice cream. So, I think she'll come back. My van's getting serviced tomorrow. So I might go and walk around and see if I can find where they're filming. I could even take some honeycomb ice cream on to set for her. I think she'd like that. Then maybe she might start to see me like I see her. Hey, Warren. Warren. Hey, Dylan. Bye, Warren. See you later, mate. # My girl, my girl # Don't lie to me. # Tell me where # Did you sleep last night # Come on and tell me, baby # In the pines, in the pines # Where the sun don't ever shine # I would shiver the whole night through # My girl, my girl # Where will you go # I'm going where the cold wind blows # In the pines, in the pines # Where the sun don't ever shine # I would shiver the whole night through # Man, I hate school. Same, man. Hey, Limpy. Excuse me? What's going on? Hey, Limpy Pete My name's Warren. Warren. Warren the wanker. # My husband was a hardworking man # Excuse me. Hey. Excuse me? Yeah? Is that your son? Yeah. He stole from me. What? I run an ice cream van and yesterday he stole from me. Really? Yeah. What do you want me to do about it? I don't know. Pay for it. Piss off, mate. Come on. Don't fucking touch me. Now back off. You owe me $3.70. Single scoop with nuts. $3.70. Bash him, mom. Shut up, you little shit. Now listen, just fuck off, alright? The police are gonna hear about this. Whatever the fuck. Just fuck off, retard. Come on. I walked around all day. No sign of anyone filming. No sign of Katie. They must have been filming somewhere else. I didn't really have any proper friends at high school. There was Matty Harrison. But he moved to Sydney in year 9. Kids used to make fun of my walk. Kids can be cruel. But, they don't know any better. I've never been in a fight. Not a proper one, anyway. I was always getting picked on by a bully at school. He used to kick the footy into me. One day he picked up my bag, And emptied it all over the ground. And everyone was laughing. Back then, I used to use a stick to walk with. And when his back was turned, I hit him with it. And he fell to the ground. And I kept hitting him. I wouldn't stop. He wasn't the only kid that picked on me. Probably not even the worst. But I took it all out on him. It's always been hard to me to find a girlfriend. I've had a few over the years. My first girlfriend was Kelly. And that's me. We lived on the same street and our parents used to hang out together. We had our first kiss at her mom's 30th. Then there was Lauren. We got together at a party after our high school formal. Everyone was really drunk, and her boyfriend was pashing on with Jess. So she asked me if I wanted to go upstairs with her. She took me into one of the bedrooms and made me lie on the bed and told me that she'd stop if I moved. She got out my penis and started pulling it. After I ejaculated, she got up and left and then I climbed out of the window and left the party. My last girlfriend was Amanda. When I left high school, I was working at the supermarket, stacking shelves and collecting trolleys, and Amanda worked in the deli. One time when we were having lunch she said, "Stop looking at my tits." And I said, "I wasn't." And then said, "Do you wanna see my tits?" "You look at me when I'm talking to you." And then when I looked up, she had hers breasts out. I lost my virginity that night. Over the next year, we had sex three times. I been pretty much alone since then. It's not too bad. I don't hate my life. It's just that, loneliness can do things to people. Unless I've got my van and my t.v. and Katie. Life's never boring with a t.v. 'Round the Block, my favorite show's about to start. Last night Bobby died. Exciting times. Can't wait to see what happens next. Until next time, Warren Thompson, signing out. I can't believe Bobby's gone. I know. I told him to stop train surfing. How do you think Ralph is taking it? Who knows? With Slug back in town causing trouble, anything could happen. I have to go to work, Sweetie. Yeah, yeah, that cunt over there. I'll fucking sort him out. Look at me, cunt. Help, somebody help! Nobody's gonna help you now, dickhead. You been having a go at me misses. No. Yeah you have. You wanna have a go at her, you have a go at me. Think you're a fucking tough cunt? I never had a go at her. You called her a liar. No, I just told her that her son stole from me. I don't give a shit. Get out of the fucking van. No. You want me to come in there? You couldn't, it's locked. We'll smash the fucking door in. It's a pretty heavy door. You don't reckon I couldn't rip the door off this fucking piece of shit? Probably not. Listen, you fucking get out here and face me like a man. Please let me go. I don't want any trouble. Well, fucking tough now. I'm sorry. I won't say anything ever again. I'm sorry. You will be. What happened. You shoulda seen the look on that fucker's face. He was fucking shitting. I'm closed. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Katie. No, that's okay. Are you alright? Yeah. I'm just a little bit shaken up. It's alright. Do you want to talk about it. No, it's nothing. Honestly. So how are you? Yeah, I'm good. Still just filming. So, where have you been filming? Just at the park around the corner. Yeah, we're doing a picnic scene. Between you and your boyfriend? On screen boyfriend. Yeah. What about your real boyfriend? Does he visit you on set? I don't have a boyfriend. Really? Look, I have to get back. But thanks for the chat, Warren. Bye, Katie. Big, big, big update. Katie George came back to my van today. And the best part is, she didn't even come for ice cream. She just came to talk to me. Like, just for a casual chat, like we're friends. I'm so excited. I learned heaps about her today. She doesn't have a boyfriend. She's not superficial. She's perfect. She's definitely going to come back to my van again. And when she does, that's when I'll make my move. Tonight's episode of 'Round the Block will not be scene due to our live broadcast of the blockbuster match between the Bombers and the Pies. 'Round the Block returns at the usual time tomorrow night. Welcome to the Granny Twatline. I'm Gloria Holes, I'll be your twat for tonight. What's your name, Tiger? Warren. Well, hello, Warren. How are ya? Not bad, and yourself? Horny. Okay. Well, before I was doing some knitting. Using my fingers got me thinkin', should be using 'em for something a little more important. What? Fingering myself. That a bit too much? A little bit. Well, why don't you tell me how you'd like to start it. I don't know. I've never done this sort of thing before. I didn't know what I was in for. Well, I mean, you did call the Granny Twatline, so, I've got a question for you, Warren. Yeah? Are you hear to chat or wank? Ralph wouldn't do that! Slug's his son! Bullshit! Ralph wants him gone. There's a soft side to Ralph. You reckon? Yeah, a definite soft spot. No. He's a good ol' fashioned hard man. I don't know. So, how old does one have to be to work for the Granny Twatline? Doesn't really matter. If I'm being honest, most of them are blokes anyway. Seriously? Yeah. Are you? No, sweetheart. I'm a lady. Well, Warren, do you want some advice? Yeah. If you want Katie George, you just need to tell her how you feel. Let her know you can take care of her, cause that's what every girl needs. You think? Definitely. Go for it, Warren. You seem like a gentleman. Thanks. So, just go get her. # One day I met a wizard, many years ago # He was very very old # He was very very wise # He told me a secret, many years ago # How to live, how to love, # How to win the golden prize # Tell 'em what the wizard says # Tell 'em what the wizard says # All you have to do is snap your fingers # Make a wish and snap your fingers # That's what you have to do # And your wishes # Will all come true # One day I met a maiden # With honey colored hair # There never was a maiden # So beautiful somewhere # The first time that I I need that spot. I've been there for years. I can't let some scum bully push me out of there. Plus, Katie knows that's my spot. If I'm not there, she won't be able to find me. You think you can handle this. Well, try this on for size. I don't want to see you around here anymore. Now, I don't want to see you around here anymore. I'll be back in two days. Okay. And I'll call you later. Hi. Good day. Sorry to bother you. I'm actually new in town and I was looking for the diner. I was told I could go there to find some work. Okay. If you just go to the end of the street and turn left, you can't miss it. Cool. Thanks. No worries. I'm Clint, by the way. Stacey. Nice to meet you, Stacey. Yeah. Hello? Hey Stace, how are you? Good. Hey, have you seen that new guy in town? Clint? No, why. I was just wondering. Why? Have you got a crush on him or something? Maybe. What about Tommo? He's always away. I need someone who can take care of me. What and you think this Clint character, he can take care of you? Maybe. Well, what do you want to happen? I hope he asks me out. I'm lonely. Hey, Ruby. Hey. Just that, please. That's someone else's parcel. Okay, yeah. Sorry. Thanks. Are you alright? Yeah. Sorry, Warren. I'm just a bit tired. I had a big night. Okay. See you later, Ruby. Bye. Sorry.

Awesome. I'm lovin' that shit, man. Fuck. Can I have another? Hey. Someone's not so tough now. Yeah, ya twat. Leave me alone. Mess with my girl again and I will kick the shit out of you. Got that, dickhead? Fucking pathetic. On this day 14 years ago, my big sister, Margaret, died. I always thought my sister was so cool. I always looked up to her. When I first started high school, some kid pushed me over, and my sister saw, and she came straight over, and pushed him up against the wall at the basketball courts and said, "If you ever touch him again", "I'll fucking kill you." She left school at the end of that year. That's when the bullying started. I'll be back in two days. Okay. And I'll call you later. Here's your pay for a job well done. Did he beg? Good. See you 'round, limpy. Hey. What? You know he offered me double for me to kill you. Yeah? What did you tell him? Same thing I told you a long time ago. What was that? I never turn down a job. I have a recurring dream about you, Katie. You come to my van, just like before, but it's different. You got bedroom eyes, and a cheeky smile. And you take my hand, and you want me to run with you. And I say that I can't run. You say, "Baby, with me, you were born to run." And then I wake up every morning and I'm smiling because of you. Can I please have chocolate? Can I have rainbow? I want chocolate and sprinkles. Can I have a rainbow please? Hey Warren! Hi Katie. How are you today? Yeah, good. Craving some ice cream. What were you thinking? I'm not sure. What would you recommend? It's a tough decision. But maybe mango gelati, if you like that sort of thing? That sounds amazing. It's my favorite. Well, I'll take one scoop of that, thanks. Okay. So, how are you today? Yeah, good, how 'bout yourself? Can't complain. Were you filming today? Yeah. We actually finished up at this location today. Really? Yeah. So you won't be coming around here anymore? Yeah. This is amazing. How much do I owe? - Katie would you go out to dinner with me sometime? Sure. I'd love to go to dinner with you. Cool. Thanks. You don't have to thank me. It'd be my pleasure. Really? Okay. When would you like to go out? Well, I'm free most nights. Okay. Why don't you just pick me up from the studio? Alright. Okay. When? Tomorrow night. Definitely. Okay. Well, how much do I owe you? Don't worry about that. Free of charge. Thank you. Well, I guess I'll see you tomorrow night. Definitely. Alright, well, see ya then, sweetie. Bye bye. Bye. I'm so glad I found you. Hello, hello? As much as I love Unforgiven, I still think The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is the greatest film ever made. Nothing that epic has been made since. Top 10 Clint Eastwood films, number ten, Magnum Force. I always wanted to be a singer. When I was in primary school, I was in the choir. It wasn't really music I liked to listen to. I like love songs in the 50s and 60s. # Good, good, good, good vibrations # # # Walk like a man # As his mama cries # On a cold gray Chicago mornin' # And another little baby child is born # In the ghetto Previously on 'Round the Block. You're just not around enough. Well, what do you want me to do, Stace? I've got to pay the bills, don't I? I can't do this anymore. Stacey, what are you trying to say? Bobby? Yes, it's me. Why are you visiting me? I need to tell you. What? Follow your heart. Follow my heart? Always follow your heart. What do you mean? You'll understand. So, what are you going to do? I don't know. I can't make up my mind. You need to start thinking about it. Is it Tommo or Clint? Follow your heart. Bobby told me to follow my heart. Well, what's your heart telling you to do? Killer waves, bro. Tell me about it. Looks like you've got a visitor, bro. Hey Stacey. I'll leave you guys alone. Later, bro. So, what's goin' on? Nothin'. Can't be nothing. What's up? Look, I'm just gonna be honest with you, Clint. I like you. Do you like me? Yeah, of course. Well, do you wanna go for a coffee or something? Yeah. I'd love that. Hi. Box of chocolates? These for a lucky lady? They're for no one. How much are they? $12. Sorry, I didn't mean to be rude. That's alright. Where's Ruby? Is she the girl who used to work here? I don't know. I guess she's quit. I just started today. Is she a friend of yours? Yeah, yeah she is. Thank you. See you. Everything I've been doing, everything I've ever wanted has lead me to today. Wish me luck. # Bill met a boy with a boy who could play, you bet # How they played when they played on his old cornet # He's got a smile and cute little style that's all his own # He'd mute his old cornet # And then he'd make it moan # Do, do, do, do, do, do # Nothing to it, but it's sweet # That tune goes right to your feet # Do, do, do, do, made a hit with a girl # They had the hair bobbin', gave him a curl # How he blew that do, do, do, do # See you tomorrow, Ralphie. Have a nice one, Miss George. Hi, Katie. Hi, how ya doin? I'm good. How are you? Yeah, good, thanks. So, you ready to go out for dinner? What? Remember, you said we're gonna go out for dinner? Excuse me? Remember? I've never met you before in my life. But Katie, it's me, Warren. Okay, stop following me. Are you okay there, Miss George? But Katie, I gave you ice cream. Stop following me or I'm gonna call for security. You're gonna throw away everything that we have. I have no idea who the fuck you are. Just leave me alone. You okay? Fucking bitch! Hey Warren. Warren, come here. Tell me you love me. I love you. Pretty, pretty Warren. I was never meant for friends. How could I be so fucking stupid? You did this to me. This is what I think of you and your stupid fucking show. Look at this, Katie. Can I speak to Gloria, please? You're not Gloria. No, you're not. Don't fucking lie to me. Pretty Katie George. Pretty lips. Beautiful lips for kissing Warren. I love you. What are you looking at, fucking freak? Stupid cunt. You look good. Thank you. A few years back, I was stuck in the habit of work. Whenever a new customer would come up to the van, instead of asking, "How can I help you?" I'd say, "Chocolate, strawberry, vanilla." Because that's what most people order. I was thinking that I was wasting my time even having any other flavors. But then I realized, out of all the flavors they could order, they'd still want chocolate, strawberry, or vanilla, because it was their favorite. The problem wasn't with them. The problem was with me. I'd forgotten how much people love ice cream. Hi Warren. I've learned to enjoy the small things in life, because sometimes that's all you've got. Small reminders that not everything has gone rotten. Life's unbearable without variety. I'd certainly hope that I could bring something different to the people in my life. Something to inspire them. Give them something to talk about 'cause at the end of the day, that's all anyone can do, make an impression. I hope when I die people will remember me with a smile. Clint Eastwood once said, he doesn't believe in pessimism. He said, "If something doesn't come out the way you want, forge ahead. If you think it's gonna rain, it will."
