Motion Pictures Art Group KADR PRESENTS "Tomorrow is already today, but it's happening tomorrow" SLAWOMIR MROZEK, 1981 All outside personnel is requested to leave the first zone of security. I repeat, all outside personnel is requested to leave the first zone of security. Center, we are entering, you can remove the security It's a bad sign. Ah, no, it happens sometimes just so, you know, spontaneously, from internal tension. Let's return and get away from here! Ladies and gentlemen! Several minutes ago a new day has begun, 9 august 1991. I believe we should remember this date. It is more than certain, that it'll be written in history of mankind in golden letters. And now, may I present a person, who has invented for us immortality The Noble Prize Winner, Professor, Dr. Victor Kuppelweiser. We welcome dear Mr. Kuppelweiser in our studio. Well, immortality is an exaggeration. We managed to introduce human organism into state of anabiosis, also known as hibernation. But, of course. I wanted to add that the last experiment, performed by Mr. Professor's scientific team an experiment of freezing a chimpanzee for 6 months has been absolutely successful! Excuse me! An experiment of thawing! Allow me to introduce to our public Mr. Albert Starski and Mr. Maximilian... Paradys! Paradys, of course. Soon, these two handsome and courageous men will be closed in containers, which may be called "sarcophagi of the XXI century" Excuse me, those are not sarcophagi, those are hibernators! Exactly. Let's hope, they will awake alive in 3 years and it'll be a proof of the victory of the humankind over the nature. So what made you, gentlemen, to take this, literally, blood-freezing decision? If you allow, I'll answer in brief. Responsibility. I, a modest biologist, shall be able to help humankind Those may be pompous words, but that's what I think. One should realize, that thanks to hibernation, many people who are incurably ill today, may be transferred into times, when there will be already remedies for their diseases. Our son is a real celebrity now, just like Gagarin As to me, risk and unknown things always attracted me. That's my life! And this hibernation thing, I may say, is very fascinating. Admit, that money fascinated you! That's why you left us! Look at him, look at him well! That's your dad! Remember him well! ...and, as I told, they were searching for volunteers, I volunteered and they have chosen me. Thank you very much. Would you like to say something else? I wanted from this place from our part, to send our greetings to all hibernation fans in the world. And can I ask you a last question - are you afraid? Of what? Exactly. The experiment has been successful, Coco is with us in the studio However, to be completely frank, I would like to say, that certain risk exists. Excuse me? From the experiments, conducted on animals, it's difficult find out about the influence of hibernation on human mental condition. We don't know how the human mind will react. Hallucinations may appear after the experiment. So let's proceed to the entrance of the cave, which will open like in the fairy tales of Arabian Nights and take our heroes inside, in order to, as if after "Open, Sesame!" Magically open in 3 years and let our heroes safely out. I also want to remind that in 3 days we shall have a congress World Female League. "The League defends you, the League gives you an advice, the League never betrays you!" Thank you very much and good night. MISSION EXMISSION SEXMISSION WRITTEN BY CAST Directed by: JULIUSZ MACHULSKI I cannot see anything! It's normal after the hibernation. So, that's it? Yes, you are already after. Thank you, thank you. I cannot see anything! So, it was successful? Yes, it was. Hah! Hah! How do they say - one-two, and no fear! Darkness, I see darkness!! I am sweating awfully, how about you? The body gives forth. Usual thing. Normal reaction after hibernation. Good day. What a beautiful personnel here! The breakfast! Thank you very much! For 3 years I hadn't eaten! Bagels, eggs, how pretty. I beg your pardon, this pastry is hard! Oh, I see! An ingenious thing you have here. Thanks. I feel like a loss of a savor in food... It has no taste at all! In the beginning you have to stay on the adaptation diet. Well, if you put it this way... I think I have something. This way or another... Wait, wait, wait...! Got it! Ah, sir, how irresponsible you are! Sorry I have to do it from the hand... Besides, it's probably forbidden to smoke here. I see no ashtrays. We couldn't see everywhere. Besides, nobody watches us. So, please, be my guest! Well, maybe only one, symbolically, for the company. Generally, I don't smoke. It's dangerous. But after this meal... We have no fire. It works! Well, I needed it... Good cigarette! "Cigarette"? CIGARETTE - MEAN OF INTOXICATION You know, I think that harmfulness of smoking is wildly exaggerated. CIGARETTE - MEAN OF INTOXICATION /OF HERBAL ORIGIN/.

They'll burn everything there! Maybe it isn't wise to smoke at the time of quarantine? It'll begin in a couple of days. Autographs, interviews, visits at industrial sites. Well, if you like it, sir... Oh, I beg your pardon! Good day... What, what is it?! Seems to me it's not allowed to smoke here. Professor Kuppelweiser? - Right. A so-called "Noble Prize" winner? - Right. He doesn't exist. Right... WHAT??? - Excuse me? Oh, sister, what's going on here? The experiment was successful, right? We are heroes, right? And you pour foam on us, right? So why the hell are you doing this? I demand explanations! You should be glad that you are alive and that you were un-hibernated at all. But wouldn't you un-hibernate us? The experiment would have lost its meaning... During the War there were more important things than scientific experiments. Which war?? What? We should have been waken up despite the political situation. Why should we care about your war? Our war? That was YOUR war. We don't have any wars. Bullshit! And who won? - What? Who won in that war you've been talking about? It doesn't matter who won, it does however matter who survived. Excuse me, ma'am, where is Professor Kuppelweiser? Dr. Lamia has already told you. That he doesn't exist? What does that mean, "he doesn't exist"? Has he had an accident again? - The same one everyone had. Excuse me, I would like to speak with the Chief of this facility. Yes? I am listening to you. - I would prefer with a male. They still don't get it, Sister. Contact with representatives of your sex is impossible. A? What? You are the only males that exist. Men are being extinct for many years. What do you mean, "extinct"? We are not mammoths, hey! It seems that actually you are. Almost literally. Excuse me, what date is today? March, 8. You slept a bit longer than planned. It passed more than 3 years? Five? - No. Four? Where could I see her? Please, Ma'am Doctor, nobody told me about that. The contract was for 3 years. You'll have to pay me extra-hours. What year is it?...Forty-four. TWO THOUSAND FORTY FOUR. No men? And why there are no windows? And no latches on doors? We slept for 53 years? Seems to me that those are the hallucinations, the Professor spoke about. Well... It was nice talking to you, ladies, but excuse u, we must go. We are already VERY late. See you. I beg your pardon, Mr. Albert. - Oh, yes. Good bye. Computer: TAKE A PILL! Sister, should I stay with you? No, thanks. I prefer to work alone. Well, good bye then. There is a electric power loss in the third sector, but I'll fix it tomorrow. Good night. Us?! With current?! Us, heroes?! Electrocute us?! What happens here...? I need to knead my muscles... What happens here?? It started just so wonderful! We were supposed to give interviews... What goes on now?? I feel so bad! Well, don't talk like this. Electric shock can be very healthy for the body. It could be a part of the experiment. Testing the subject's reaction to the mental shock Excuse me, Mister, what are you suggesting here? Am I some kind of a guinea-pig for experiments? World without guys! Interesting, well, how do they reproduce? V. O: There is no problem with that. A woman always was the origin of the life. No, but we did help you a bit with that! And I would not say that without pleasure... V. O: Have you heard about artificial parthenogenesis? I am officially protesting against listening to private conversations! V. O: We are self-supporting due to parthenogenesis. Parthe - what? Parthenogenesis. Virgin breeding. Virgin breeding. If they went so far... If they came to this... Came to what?!? What are you talking about? V. O: Time to sleep. What is this "virgin breeding"? No, no... You better not ask me about this! V. O: Try to remember what are you dreaming about in the new place. Dreams are very important thing. I only hope we are still not awake, Mr. Max. But what, what's going on? V. O: Good night! Oh, please, please, don't switch off! Can I call the city from here? I have to ask about something! My wife is worried! Aren't you getting too perky in "GENETIX" with all these late time visits? Good evening, well, I give up. But it's a totally private visit: I was passing by and I thought I'd pop in And you, for sure, have a lot of interesting work to do since you stayed here overnight. You can learn about everything from the bulletins, Sister. Obviously. But, in bulletins one doesn't put information about special operations. Obviously. This is classified data. Of course. Ah! I have something for you. And for what occasion? "What, what"? For your success! Seems that you have dug out something. Rumors. Don't let them fool you. Is that so? One, your vacations have been canceled. Two, the whole sector where your excavations were performed has been sealed off, one and two is three, and three means a secret. I only make conclusions from the facts. I am sorry, but couldn't you make your conclusions somewhere else? I really world like to have a rest. I understand. The Secret wears you down. It's such a pity, Lamia, that you left us. You could make a great career in "GENETIX". In "ARCHEO" it works for me not bad at all. "ARCHEO"! Digging out old sentiments... well, okay, my dear... However, it would be better if you had shown THEM to us. Whom? Whom do you think? Mr. Max! Where are you? Good day! Is anything wrong? Ah, well, nothing. Good day. Quiet! What are you doing? What are you looking for? Bugs they have planted! V. O: It's useless. You won't find anything. It's unbearable! Permanent surveillance! TV: "...parthenogenesis is a form of virgin breeding. It's based on mechanical fertilization of a female ovum..." You ordered the TV? Mr. Max... TV: "...by another cell from the female body." TV: "So, when the parthenogenesis was performed for the first time and by whom?" "Artificial parthenogenesis was first performed 130 years ago" Children from the test-tubes... Really? The look alike, indeed TV: " and was done by entering a blood cell fragment through sharp glass needle into an unfertilized ovum..." TV: "in 1939, Gilda Pinkus performed..." V. O: Our method of reproduction is the most perfect one. Shame on you, how dare you to teach such ugliness to children! Introducing... virgin egg... in uterus... ovum to ovum... Come on, not during the meal, for God's sake! They already know. Yesterday Tekla was here. I expected it. "GENETIX" has its women everywhere. But they'll want to take them from us, won't they? No, relict cases and excavations belong to us and Tekla knows that. I worry only... Well, how's the research? Thanks, goes well. I believe I will be able to prove my thesis, that men were the missing evolutionary link between apes and us. Do they behave aggressively? No, the tall one is nice. The short one has a bad influence on him. Remember, the contamination danger level is not know yet. Limit the amount of contacts to the minimum. Thank you, Sister. Take care. Mr. Albert, we need to find some kind of auxiliary language of communication, you understand? COMPUTER: Take the pill! Do you speak any foreign language? No... hmm... They might have an interpreter. I suggest like this: If, for example I take 2 spoons of that pink stuff, that will mean - 'fall down'! Or, for example, I take off the shirt - that will mean 'join me'! You suggest some kind of code? To synchronize our actions? No... well... something of that kind... Actual, Mr. Max, I can't get what are you intending to hint... Ah, well, we don't understand each other... Mr. Albert? Are you not sleeping too? It's chilly here... But of course! The switched on some kind of that damn thing, and seems to me, on purpose! Mr. Max? - Yes? Lay next to me! It'll be warmer! Thank you! Like during the military service... Mr. Albert? - Hmm? Tell me frankly, like a scientist, OK, - ... - Mmm? Is that possible for women to reproduce themselves in such a way? Absolutely possible. It was possible even in our times, but not in such a scale. Holy God! Fifty-three years! We overslept the best years of our lives! In an eyeblink we lost our families, friends... Oh, shit!! I was supposed to get an apartment in '98... Never, never I'll let anyone to freeze me again. Maybe you have some left? Oh, I'm sorry, please, please, help yourself! Mr. Albert, what happened? No, you can't! I understand, it's hard now, but we have to live somehow! A human being is able to accommodate himself to every situation! Please! I thought, maybe we could address each other more familiarly, I mean, by name? Oh, I haven't dared to propose... with pleasure! Albert... Maximilian... Thank you. TV: This match is their last chance! TV: "GENETIX" gets a grip... It's almost one minute till the end... TV: They can do it now! They can do it now! TV: Loss of attention, and the middle-forward player of "ARCHEO" manages to make her way to the hole! TV: One-Zero! One-Zero! They will not have a chance to make it a tie! TV: One. Yes, yes... TV: It's the end of the match. TV: Now it's time for the traditional exchange of the shirts, and I remind, that... What happens here?! TV: It is One-Zero for the guest team... What is it? Look, Alberty, look, look, look! Look! Fantastic broadcast. You watch the TV the whole day, and that's what you are paying attention to! What a game! Oh! Replay! Replay! No, they didn't make a replay of THAT! Hold on... if the things go right, it could be just a paradise for us! What? A paradise! Only girls everywhere, all of them single, only two of us, virtually no competition, You can't dupe the Nature! You prefer brunettes or blondes? How can you? Our civilization is stuck in deep shit, and you are thinking about all these stupid things! Ah, here is our blonde sweetie... Let's try... Good day. Good day. We are at the fifth day of your quarantine. Try to define your general self-feeling according to the scale from 1 to 10. From 1 to 10? Well, in your presence - "7". So far... "Seven". Let me out of here! "Let-me-out"...that means "one". How about the food? Thank you, it's better. That pink stuff is very good. "Five", well, maybe even "Six". Not eating and shall not eat. Intravenous feeding will be prescribed. Physical condition? "Ten"! Any other requests? Couldn't we go together for a walk? To dance a little? By what right are you touching me? By immemorial law of the Nature, baby... That was extremely unsanitary thing to do! I warn, I'll have to put you down! And I am warning, that I was a first-degree boxing champion! Clown! Can I order some music? Keep away from me! Jesus! I am not aggressive! Aggressiveness - "one"! Don't do it again! Otherwise, we'll be compelled to put you into sleep! Maxie! Are you OK? Alberty! It works! What's it, Sister? Do you need any help? Are you feeling bad? Everything is OK. Go back to your work. Who has let her in? She had a special permission. No one could deny her. You should treat them carefully! They are unique. My name is Emma Dax, We shall work together. These two individuals have a particular task in "GENETIX" program, which the Government concerns about. I am personally responsible for genetic safety of this sector. You will follow my orders. I follow only Dr. Berna's orders, and I have to report her about your visit. Do me a favor! Dr. Berna herself is at Her Excellency, who wishes to observe those males. I came here to accompany you. My colleague wanted to have a walk! Put it on! Shirts into trousers! I can't imagine me taking those orders from a broad! Gloves! But, please, don't make faggots from us! Its essential in order to exit from here. T H I S is not the Kuppelweiser's clinic! Sorry. Wait, wait, wait! Where are you taking me to? Follow me! Good day, where are you taking me to? For what purpose? I am asking you, please, just go! Sluice-3, Sluice-3, open up! Hi! Tell me, where is your daddy? What is "daddy"? Poor baby! You're my! My! Me too! Me too! Oh, my little birds! You don't know who daddy is? What have they done to you! Sister!!! Please, take the kids!! But!...No protests allowed!! Junior class, make pairs and follow me at once! Go! They took away their parents! Poor children... Follow me! They don't know their fathers. Apocalypses. Emma Dax to Her Excellence! Oh, my God! Some kind of mutants! Alberty... What could spawn them? Phew! Oh! Maxie! Look! Apples! Two of them, exactly... They are already here. Hibernation is a future. If we could lower our body temperature in 2 degrees, we could live twice as longer. But our brave girls are here with males, let's go and see them, I'm very curious. They have a specific smell. This is sweat. Outcome effect after hibernation. How old are they? 86, but the biological deterioration is only 40.6% What shall we do with them? I beg your pardon, ma'am, but there is some kind of mistake here. My colleague and I would like to ask you a couple of questions... You must address Her Excellence as "Your Excellence..." Excellence... Well, in this case permit me to introduce myself. I'm Paradys! He's got a weapon! Up on your legs! Leave him! Release him! He didn't mean anything... Don't bite me! - You can release him. Don't bite me, you...! My colleague just wanted to introduce himself. What... what do you say... I just wanted to ask... but... What happened to MEN? Yeah, what have you done to all the men? Not us. That's your friend Kuppelweiser. Mr. Professor?! At the time of the war he invented a warfare, which was supposed to paralyze male genes temporarily. However, something was overlooked or missed, and the M-bomb instead of paralyzing, eliminated the male genes. Once and forever. If so, maybe we could help you somehow? I mean, as reproductors for the mankind. According to our capabilities, of course. Indeed. It's not the first time we devote ourselves to the service for the mankind. Of course... and the payment can be done later, at the end, together with the balance for the hibernation. Come on, money is not important here What does he want? He wants it to be like in was BEFORE. Like before... World with men... But this is logical! Typically male point of view. You see? This is our Holy Apple tree, planted by the very hands of our foremother. From such a tree a male has picked up an apple and seduced a woman with it, and therefore we lost the paradise once and forever. And so, exactly today... Oooh! Where are our Holy Apples?! You disgraced our Shrine of Nature! You gorged our Holy Apples!! Holy? These crabs are sacred for you? My babies, my little apples! Who will bring them back to me... What a disaster... But, but really we couldn't figure out that these apples had such an importance for you. We had no idea that it was connected to the legend, and besides, these apples were absolutely tart. I am afraid, dear Berna, that your services has dug out some kind of new Pandora Box. What? No, not a Box, please! Take them away! Lock them in, don't let them go out! Wait, wait! Let me free, I'll make up for theses damn apples! What, what, don't push me! I'll go myself! I'll go myself! A woman beats me! Takes me down! Oh, please, let me rest in peace... Is that YOU who talks like this? Get up! I won't! I'll lay like that! We have to flee immediately from here! Where to? Can't you see how everything is organized here? They'll catch us everywhere! We must escape! What? Through what? Doors are under current! What? Underground? A lamp is under the floor. Everything is under surveillance! Leave me alone! You can't think like this! Somewhere around here must be another, better world! A vacuum cleaner... Seems to me, we'll think out something... Nah, impossible... COMPUTER: Take a pill! We are sitting here already eight days... and nights. I understand, you are on duty, Miss. You, come here. Where are you going? Come to me. Good boy... You lady owner is so beautiful, but so rigid... And why she is so rigid? A paper? Here you are. What? Tasty paper? Eat, eat... If you don't eat, your lady will lock you in a closet, like us here. And now - the air condition is off! Be a nice vacuum cleaner! Your authorization, Sister? Lamia Reno, "ARCHEO" special mission. All clear. Visit objective? I'd like to meet the oldest inmate. Check who is the oldest there... Aye, Sister. Everything changes every day... They die like flies... It won't last long... JULIA NOWACK, 74 YEARS CELL # 114 You have half an hour. Happy Holidays! I feel excellent and I am happy to be a pensioner in the Honored Anility Shelter. I would be happy to live in warmth and tranquility till the lucid end of my days... Oh, no! It went off again! Look, what junk we have to work with! Madam Officer, please, don't torture me. I don't remember anything, because I'm senile. Don't be afraid, granny, they don't hear us. I'm not afraid of anything, I have nothing to hide... And what do you have here? Have a mercy, dear, don't look here! You know that it's forbidden. No, please, don't take it from me! I was so happy when it grew finally! What is this? A potato! A real starch, not some kind of synthetics! I have something better. Jam? Strawberry? You'll get the whole jar if you tell me something. Can I taste it a bit? Isn't it too sweet? Good, sour a little bit... What happened? A fuse... I'll fix it right away... Watch them! Keep an eye on them in the cell! Oh, that's it. The whole phase went down! Switch emergency lights on! Switch emergency lights on! Attention! Don't move! Not in the eyes! Not in the eyes! Everyone stays in place! What the men were for? Me... Men? What for?! Well... they were useful in all kinds of situations... I almost don't remember anything... How come? At your times they were still at the day schedule! Yes... yes... day schedule... and night schedule too. And what about you jam? It's yours. I'll tell you a secret. We have dug out two of those. Alive! Alive?! I am writing a paper on them. They were hibernated in 1991. 1991... What a year it was... What's up with you? You've got lights? Come on, put the lights on!! Emergency lights went off too... They were a moment ago here! Maybe they've hidden themselves in the toilet? Can I help you? They're gone! Seek for them! Hide! Check the elevators! Oh Jesus! Just like my Josus! You said "Jesus", what does that mean? Josus, I said Josus, that was the name of my fianc?. What's "fianc?"? What are you, new generation, doing with all your feminism? It isn't worth to be a woman if there are no men. What they were needed for? For entertainment, ...in some kind of sense. You have a TV for entertainment. There is something that attracts to them. It's even fascinating. I dreamed about them tonight. Oh, my girl, haven't you fallen in love with one of them? What do you want to do with them? We want to propose NATURALIZATION. How? You want to transform them into women? Don't you know that it's worse than death for them? Ah, what an occasion to put all things into order! If I only were younger, I'd do anything to save them! But you are not like others. What's your name? Lamia... Lamia... So? They aren't there! In the elevator too! I do not know. Who taken this peg where from here? I'll check one more time. You watch here! OK. This device was used for inflicting cut wounds! In this way the males were torturing women! Male is your enemy! Male is your enemy! What this instrument was used for, Sisters? I don't think you need an explanation! Section Special Always Loyal!! You understand why our great-grandmothers couldn't sustain it any longer and founded The League! "The League defends you, the League gives you an advice, the League never betrays you!" Sorry, unintentionally! Excuse us! Please continue! We are already leaving! Who are they? No, the idea was very good. Yes, but we should have taken left in the corridor. I start to like it. We'll escape tomorrow the same way! In spite of the fact, that you have insulted Her Excellence very much and your behavior has caused incalculable losses to our power lines, we want to give you the last chance. And what do we have to do? It will be enough to submit us this petition. "To the Supreme Commission of the Purity of the Type" "I, the undersigned, state, that I was born as a man despite my will. In view of the mentioned above fact, I plead to disregard all the actions, performed by me while being a man, because I acted under influence of conditions, created by the male civilization. I absolutely agree with the concept that there were no men, they do not exist and there is no need in them." Maybe you can read it to me again? I would suggest you to think over again and to sign. And if we do not sign? You will sign. You will stand before the Assembly that will decide what to do with you. Court of Broads? Thanks! I don't move from here. Your move. Sit down. All negotiations we can do only after being released from this premises. Actually, we could sign. In such a situation every lawyer could acquit us. And what about the principles? Your move. Oh, an interesting beginning. What? What? Hide! Into the WC, and block ourselves! Oh shit!! I protest! In the name of science I protest! I won't go! I won't go! Aa! It's hurts! It hurts! First of all, dear Sisters, I apologize for the delay. And I remind that the course and the outcome of today's session is strictly secret. Please. Today we have two items on the agenda. Both are sitting in front of you. What an important reason... Such an assembly! Now we pass the floor to our dear Dr. Berna Here we have convened sisters, so we could decide the future fate of two persons of another sex, who, instead of extinction due to the logical laws of evolution, have appeared among us by the strange caprice of the fate. I would like to present here the position of the "ARCHEO" service because, so to say, we have in our office the comprehensive data on their subject. Who would like to take a floor? I think we have nothing to consider here. Our great-grandmothers have already shown us the objective and the way to it, and we are walking this way steadily and happily. Never again we allow to happen the situation, where woman would be a waitress at the feast of live, ruled by male. Never again! Off go the males! Male is your enemy! We are keeping the position of non-admission of the infection, which name is a man, and to which we are all immune. Aren't you exaggerating? When world wouldn't move from its place without a man. History of progress is the history of men. You can't deny that! All great scholars, fathers of progress, great humanists, inventors were men! And so... Who, for example? Be more specific! Copernicus, for example! Lies! Copernicus was a woman! What? And Einstein? Einstein was also a woman! And maybe Curie-Sklodowska also? Well, that wasn't the best example. Because I was angry! Sorry... These male extremists are talking here about male inventions. And what did they invent? Let's start from the beginning: Some male, called Cain has invented murder and tried on his sister Abel. Others invented prostitution, slavery, cowardice, laziness. To make a long story short, owing to you we have all evil in the world, staring from religious wars and ending with uterine cancer. Oh yeah? Why aren't we responsible for the hail, earthquakes and whooping cough? Our world is much better than the one they remember. So why do they criticize it all the time? Aren't you sick by any chance? You're thinking too much recently. A healthy organism lives and acts, only a sick one thinks. Uselessness - that's another typical male feature. As you see, we are getting along perfectly without them. We are living in a settled and quiet world, without famine, wars, sexually transmitted diseases and other male inventions. What do have to say on your behalf? What? - You must make a speech! A happy occasion as our emersion gives you a unique chance to return things to their natural order. You are tormenting yourselves with those test-tubes for half a century already, without even knowing what you have deprived yourselves from. In our world you were on pedestal. Everyone courted you, loved you, brought you heaps of flowers. You were the inspiration for poets, symbol of the highest ideas and beauty. By eliminating the male half of the world you destroyed half of yourselves! Don't rape the rights of the Nature! No reason to listen to them any further. All this is a kind of a provocation. I know! You all went nuts because you haven't had a man for a long time! You all need man! I'll sit myself...! As you can see, the Nature didn't want it... What does that mean "to have a man"? Probably, it's something about male domestic service, wide-spread in XXth century. If everyone has spoken out, let's proceed to the voting. Let them wait outdoors for the result of the voting. Great speech! You got them! I feel as if I was expelled from boy scouts, damn it! COMPUTER: Take a pill! From the part of the "ARCHEO" service I propose the NATURALIZATION of both males. My duty of the "GENETIX" representative is to warn you, dear Sisters, about the results of humanitarian caprice of our dear "doctor" Berna. By no means we have to introduce them in our society. Both these subjects have to be eliminated as soon as possible, and before that they have to be handed over to the "GENETIX" services in order to perform on them certain important biomedical experiments. I object! My honorable colleague demonstrates on purpose the so-called harmfulness of both males in order to enhance the prestige of her service and get additional fundings for her suspicious "experiments". Objection! This is an insinuation! Genetics is the most important of all sciences, no matter if you like it or not! Very interesting! Stop it, Sisters! Have some respect for our Assembly. So we have two proposals for the preliminary voting. Please, who is for the elimination of the males and who is for the naturalization of them. Cast your votes now. What? Attention! Jesus, Jesus, Jesus! What? What happened? Alarm! They escape! Alarm! To hell with it! Throw it away! My leg! To elevators! To elevators! What shall we press? Ground floor. But "1" is at the top. Oh, it moves, moves. Good. Thank you so much, Maxie! That's nothing. We must have them! Even if I don't know how! "ARCHEO". Naturalization - 155, against - 154. Walk them in. It seems to me that something got burned! Help! Help! Males have escaped! They pulled off the gas seal! What?! Why have they escaped? Yet everything has ended just fine! Haven't I told you? Haven't I warned you that they are dangerous? Genetix-1 to Section Special: Alarm at the North-Eastern sector! I repeat: Alarm at the North-Eastern sector! Enter the code, over JS18427, OL70946 accepted. Grid - on! No impulses. 75! No impulses. 50! No impulses. 25! Weak impulses. Up or down? Down... Excuse me, may I go out? Why are you looking at me like this, Sisters? Well, I am2 kilograms overweight... Max! Let's run! What's up? Don't you forget where we are? Go! What's this? What is this, Sisters? Entering the pool in the outdoor clothes? You should have had yourselves undressed in the elevator! That a guy couldn't have... with a naked chick... in the elevator!! Guten Tag. Passkontrolle. Die Ausweisse, bitte. This nightmarish sky-scraper ever ends? Boost the scale. Distinct impulses! Let's get them! They are on the third level! Genetix-1 to the team, Genetix-1 to the team, They are on the third level! Excuse me, where is Hotel "Intercontinental"? Intercontinental? Ein moment bitte, eee... We don't know. We've just arrived. Yes, Sister, yes. What did you say, Sister? I had that feeling that it comes from "GENETIX"... So this is their hatchery? Here they reproduce themselves. No shit! Anybody there? Look, elevator! Come here. Ground floor? Seems like it's getting colder. Fresh wind. We are close to the exit! And where? It looks like some kind of an ancient mine! And the earrings are beeping! Feeling impulses! Squad, get down! Move! You have 15 meters walk to dig! That will wean you from your decadence! Move yourselves! Faster! What are you doing here? We haven't called yet anyone from "ARCHEO" today! We haven't dug out anything! We thought you have. We've been told to come here! No, that's misunderstanding. Yes? Well, you swindled us well, Sisters! What do you think, we have no work to do? You swindled yourselves! What a brothel I see here! What did you say? You have the brothel in your "ARCHEO" yourselves! But, but... You are all one big excavation pit! No passage. Careful!! It's just a boot... Hey! Our guys were here! Our professor! The paper is dated by 1993! "China protest - the reason for the UN disbanding" "The USA's debt?" "Alaska resold to..." Mother of God! "M-Bomb in mass production!" What's it? Who's there? Get away! Stop! They are in the corridor #40 A. Cut their way off! There! Get in! I fall down! Hold it! I hold it... He! There is a different company here! Finally! More nice here... Go! Careful. After all, that's the same broads down there. You arrived here to spy on us? Sisters from "ARCHEO"! They are somehow different! Absolutely... entirely different! Go with us! Faster! Alarm! Hide yourself! Maxie! Maxie! This is some kind of new decadence herd! Yeah, we eliminate this one - and the next will emerge on this place. What do they want? Attention, baby! Albert! Albert! Retreat... We encountered a decadence herd. Requesting backup. Let cakes live! Off go the earrings! You won't beat us all! Come, come! Albert! Let's leave! Alberty! Alberty! Where are you? Why have you done this to me?! You, my ugly face! What does she do here? You wanted to go for a fresh air? We are going there. I don't believe you, miss! Please. We have to trust her. I'll walk you to the exit. I really do it for your own good! OK, we go, we go... Lamia Reno. 6364 Archeo. Where are we? In the Blockhouse "C". Take a look. What is this? Land. The one you wanted to escape to. How could you allow everything this to happen? Wait, wait... How's that? Does that mean that we've been staying all that time underground? 365 meters under the sea level. I had that feeling, damn it, I had it from the beginning! And isn't it possible to go outside at least for a little? Today on the surface there are 300 units. Units of what? Of Kuppelweiser Radiation. M-Bomb's side effect. That's why our ancestors were forced to go under the ground, and later they expanded our station-city to the present scale. It means that nowhere one can go out... What do you want to live there for? For nothing. Naturalization is your only chance. But it must be some safe way to go outside! To repair these devices, at least! There are anti-radiation suits, but the oxygen supply is for one hour only. Doesn't matter. Where are those suits? You'll die there in 12 days. Better 2 weeks there than the whole life here, like a mole! You'll get used to it. - Never! Where's the exit? Let's go! Don't you think that I shall help you to escape! I am a loyal functionary of the society! And instead of that what a nice girl you could be, Lamia... I have no choice. Betrayal! Oh, hell, we are surrounded! Lamia! I shall not forget it! I shall not forget it it! I'll return! You will see! Well done, my dear. You had a wonderful idea. You deserve an advancement. It belonged to you for a while already. In the name of the SERVICE I express my gratitude. Ah, I almost forgot! Be so kind as to transfer to Emma all materials regarding those males. For what purpose? I'll continue with Dr. Tekla the work you've begun. Since they are more dangerous than we assumed, it'll be proceeded under our guardianship. Don't be troubled! We'll make conclusions from your observation. What conclusions? I have the completed work on their subject! But of course, we'll make use of it. I wouldn't laugh if I were you! It brings you wrinkles! What do they prepare, what do they want to do with us? Soon you'll be able to call me "my baby girl"! What for! What for! I prefer to die than to be a woman! We also assumed that you'd prefer death to naturalization. You said that you would devote yourself to science. We gonna give you such an opportunity. Some our Sisters that hold high executive positions got old and weary. Your fresh, health and strong organs will rejuvenate them. Darling, call Dr. Oscia, tell her that the kidney will be ready today No, no, no!!! And from your remains we'll try to synthesize highly nutritious substance. Protein in our conditions is more and more difficult to obtain. Maybe cremation of our dead is unacceptable squandering. The experiment we are going to conduct will have, thanks to you, a fundamental significance for our survival. That's cannibalism! I wish you to choke on us! Damn mantes! So good luck. See you. And you, guys, farewell, we won't see each other again. How's it? It's impossible, impossible! This is violation of every convention! This is inhumane! I protest! I protest! Albert, don't leave me alone! Don't leave me alone! Max! Thank you for everything, buddy! Thank you! Farewell! Don't leave me alone! Albert! Long live men! Long live men! No, no, no!! Stop yelling, Mr. Paradys, or I'll gag you. And how do you know my last name, cannibal? And who left a wife with a child in August 1991? How do you know that? Because I am that child! My Jadwinia? Jadwinia... I have nothing in common with you! I even changed my last name. Really, you look a little bit like mommy! Don't even mention the name of my mother, of a miserable victim of your male crimes! So you are against your daddy? Don't you remember how I carried you on my neck, spanked your butt? You owe me the best moments of your childhood! Childhood that I never had! You volunteered to be hibernated then only to leave me with mommy! And now there are no more fathers! And we'll try to prevent them from appearing ever! Understood? Jadwinia! Untie your daddy immediately and ask for apology! Dr. Yanda, the patient is waiting. Coming! And you, I'll leave you for the dessert, daddy! No, no, this cannot be truth! Somebody twitch me! And after that I'll be a woman? Narcosis? Excellent! Till when should I count, dear ladies? One, two... Watch him, Sister. Scalpel. What happens here? Who took scalpel from me? What are you giving me? Dirty... Aaah, who cares... Who's here? Aaah!! It's your punishment, dearie! Dr. Yanda is unconscious! Male has escaped! Doors are blocked! Water! We have no time! To elevator! Albert, please, enter the elevator! Don't wanna be a woman... Be a man! Come on, wake up! What are you doing to him? You want him to wake up? The experiment is over. Oh, God, so it did turn out well? Well, hell yeah, it did! Even better! You cannot even imagine what did I dream of! And, let me tell you, what I dreams I had! What dream was that? I dreamed that we woke up in the world without men. Only broads? And, imagine yourself, they were reproducing from the test-tubes! Underground? How do you know it? Oh, my... But I've seen the same! And forgive me for saying that, they wanted to castrate us! Professor! What the science says about such a coincidence of the dreams? This is very interesting, but absolutely impossible. Impossible... All is well that it was only a dream. Oh, he's awake! But I had such a nice dream! Come on, Albertie, stop whining... And what does she do here? She betrayed us! But now she helped us to escape. Why are you doing this? They took from me you and my work. They won't get anything! And what happens if they catch us again? They won't get us alive! We have to get rid of them! These are identificators! It'll hurt a little bit! We got them! Impulses are from this elevator! Here are the impulses... What a shame, to let those males to flee right from the operation table. Oh, Dr. Tekla will give it hot to us. Maybe it's time to think about the Shelter, Sister? Somebody must have helped them... Localize Lamia Reno! Maybe I took it to the work? Go look, quickly! Again you, Lamia? What do you want? Let me in, please! Seems that I left here my logbook. Get in, quickly! The supervisors can catch us... Just for a minute, I don't need... What? What are you doing? Careful, Sister! You'll blow us up! I'll blow, if you don't help us! Undress yourselves! Fast! Faster! Lamia, what are you... Undress! Face to the wall! Turn aside! Impulses on. Lamia Reno. Blockhouse "C". My premonition was right! Direction - Blockhouse "C"! Aye, Sister! OK, just a moment! Ready. And now the external suits! We can't without Her Excellence permission! There are 300 units outside! Counting to three. One... Lamia, what's up with you? Two... But... Lamia, open up, we know you're inside! ...Laser...! Lamia, give us the males! Think about whom are you helping! It'll be too late for you when we enter! Faster, Lamia! Lamia, can you hear me? It'll be too late after that! Lamia! Why the hatch doesn't go down? What's up? What's up? What happened? Why it doesn't go down? Malfunction? - What's wrong? You gave me the wrong key! Why it doesn't work? Key is not enough! You need a vocal password! Which password? We have no idea! The password knows only Her Excellence! This is lie! You want to win some time! I give you five seconds! Password! Don't blow us up! We really don't know! One, Two... Lamia, realize whom are you helping! Those are men! Why won't they let us out? We'd peacefully die out there! Everything is over... MOTHER FUUUCCKKK!! We did it! They knew the password? What does that mean? We did it! Courage, Albert! Now courage! Now run away faster! We'll die free! Thank you, Lamia! Out now! Run with us! Here is my place, and besides, I'd like to see their faces! You are lovely girl, Lamia! Thank you for that too! For these two weeks... Lamia, realize whom are you helping! It'll be too late for you when we enter! Don't move! Lamia, do you hear me? We couldn't stop them. That fanatic threatened to detonate the Blockhouse! And who let them in, ha? We'll discuss it later! Now the suits, faster! They couldn't run away too far! Bravo, Lamia! You did it! First male decision in your life! But what's next? Desert! Desert... What happened? Don't get it... don't get it... What is it, Max? Aaah, I'm sick and tired from all your underground hide-and-seek games! Oh, shit... Careful! Are you OK? Don't know yet... It must me some kind of preventive filter... What a mystification! Why should they do all this work? Seems to me that I was here already! Is this an external space already? Hey! Careful, it can be polluted! What are you waiting for? There are no more suits. That's bad. Well, I'm after them anyway! I'll be in contact with you. If you find more suits, follow me! Aye, Sister! I found something strange! I got them! Forest! Green forest! Careful, it can be artificial! Lamia, follow me! Not so fast! Isn't it the same where to die? We have oxygen left for two minutes only... But it's so beautiful! But it's so beautiful! It was worth it! He went crazy! Max, Max! We are saved! Saved! A stork! Look, a stork! If he can live, so can we! Stork, storky! Take it off! Lamia, take off this helmet! Let's go! His nest should be somewhere there! No! Take it off, you're gonna suffocate! Can you hear me? He's right. You're suffocating! Take it off! Leave me alone! Seems that something occurred to them. They took off the suits! Following them. How could you live in such drafts! Your station of some kind? Don't know. You hold? Saint Jules! Unbelievable! What's the hell is up there? See yourselves! It's some kind of a blockhouse! Could we be transfered in time? That's some kind of Fata Morgana! But we are at home! This is a house from your period? Exactly. The second half of the XX century! Real! Everything real! Base, reply! Something is happening here! Base! Please, be my guests! Breakfast is ready! Please be seated. My pleasure. And maybe it's just a museum, and these are all the exhibits? What museum? What exhibits? Everything is fresh! Miss Lamia, please! Please... Oh, oh, the baby soiled herself! Take it away... An egg should be peeled carefully, only the shell a little bit... And it jumped out! Yes, yes. Difficult! So you got dirty. Take off these gloves, come on! I'll have a coffee now! I couldn't imagine that a food can be such a pleasure! You'll learn a lot of pleasure, my baby! Hands up! In the name of Her Excellence you all are arrested! She run out of oxygen! Well, talking about egg, for example, I like half-boiled ones most. She really takes it too serious! A little bit of salt... And now most important is to cut the tip like this... Don't be shy, Alberty! Mouth-to-mouth! Now we can take it off... and here we have the yolk You might need a nice bed for this! I am only providing the aid! Well, well... can't recognize you, my colleague! Who could think... Beware of still water! I beg your pardon, so, when butter melts inside, wow, you are going to lick your fingers! I am only providing the aid! And what are we talking about? Where am I? Where is my suit? Why are you undressing me? I want back to the Base! They will save us! Maybe they will save YOU, and what about us? And, after all, there is no radiation! How's that? What does that mean - "no radiation"? Our measuring devices are correct! If you want, you can die! I am out of here! Stay! You were fooled! Deceived! There is no radiation! You've seen animals, flowers, birds! TV: "...lost their lives. Emma Dax from "GENETIX" service ...and Lamia Reno from "ARCHEO" service." They made us dead? No, that's impossible! TV: "...unprecedented procedure could be performed." You see? They got rid of you too. TV: "For a long time rumors have been circulating about a discovery of two persons, hibernated in the end of the 20th century." No, that's impossible! TV: "We are asking the "ARCHEO" service representative." "I wish to confirm hereby that indeed, both males have been dehibernated. However, the danger was prevented, since early this morning in "ARCHEO" special clinic the naturalization procedure has been performed. This will help them to find and realize themselves in our society. Here they are after the procedure." What? They are lying at a broad daylight! TV: "...it was impossible for me before that procedure, because as a creature of lower stage of evolution, I could be dangerous in certain circumstances to the public." TV: "I feel myself superb as well, and I would like to thank the operation team of this installation for such a fast and proficient bringing me to a viable condition." Why do they lie like this? - For the supreme idea. But this is an ugly thing to do! Since it could disturb the whole community. You can't do this to the people! They lie! Lie! I don't want! I don't want! No... You don't want me to touch you? Yes, yes... no... don't know... Let's go and see the upstairs... So should I stroke you or not? Yes... no... To stroke or not to stroke? Who lives here? Anyway, it doesn't matter. Let's go! To stroke or not to stroke? I don't know! It's too much air here! I wanna return to the Base! I don't want... I'll take it off and I'll spank you! I don't understand what happens to me... How beautiful. Late rococo. It's very hot today. Really, it is hot. It's nicer when it's cool. Well, in the present situation that we have here, being the representatives of different sexes, yes, well... As a humanist, I would like to propose to return, maybe, to more traditional method of contact between two persons of different sex... What are you doing? I am a ranked functionary... Right now you are not a functionary. You are a woman. What are you doing? Step by step we are getting close to the great mystery of the Nature. You are making huge steps... The last step might be small step of the man, but it will be enormous for the whole humankind. I would like to propose... I would like to propose intimate relationships... What means? You see, you know nothing about the life... How's that?! I graduated from three faculties! Aaah, these faculties of yours... To say it simple... you have those test-tubes, right? And I think about another, better, direct method. For example, like, well, two animals, see... like... But I love you very much!!! Love is a kind of dope the man used in order to capture the soul of... Aaah, COME HERE!! What's this? What's this? This is the life. What is that fun over there? It's the beginning of a new world. And if girls will be born? Don't mention this word! Every nine months - a boy, I mean two, and maybe even twins? Shit, it's not enough, though. Leave it, leave it. You cannot save THAT world. HERE everything is nice and settled down. Max, it must be done in a massive scale. Sexplosion! We'll beat them with their own weapon. What do you mean? Max... What's this? An elevator! Where could be an elevator here? I've heard the elevator! Where? Pimpcia, Pupcia, Dziubutek! I gonna feed you now! Aphrodita, you'll get too. Who drank from my glass? Who sat on my coach? Strange... Good day! Jolek lives here? Catch her, Max! Catch her! Gentlemen! Gentlemen! I beg you! I'll do everything you want! I beg you! Just don't hand me over! So that's kind of Excellence you are! They almost castrated us, and you are fixing tits to yourself, you, gypsy bastard! I couldn't! I couldn't! I had to be even more indifferent, than they were. Otherwise they would have suspected. How did you manage to hide yourself? Aaah, that's a long story. Immediately after the war, when the League seized the power, I was only four years old. All the boys that survived were naturalized to girls. And I was hidden by my mommy. So that was the way I grew up, in girl's disguise. Then I started to work actively for the League, and 10 years ago they elected me as Her Excellency. Then I could relax at last and moved to the house of my mommy. But there are thousands of women that are fooled! They have to be released! There is no radiation! It wasn't so powerful as predicted. In the beginning it was a panic, but Later, when they started to live under the ground, there was no sense to dissuade them. And it's easier to rule when they are under the ground. And what happened to the sexual urge? Yes? The League thought about everything. A special pill transformed it into ambition for the career. And you use your privileges? Why don't you restore with a help of some girl the natural order of the world? Even if I wanted, nothing could happen. Why so? That's the greatest drama of my life. What? I never had a courage to deal with women. I am simply scared of them! What shall we do to him? He's a guy after all. Yet we shall not hand him over to those witches... Good! Let's settle it like this: We don't hand you over, and you let us live here! Great! Guys, I'm so glad! Feel yourself at home! I'm so tired of those broads! Let me show you something... That's my Center of Control. Nice toy! We'll govern and command from here, Who's there? There are two ladies with us, they stay too. Two? Only two. This is Here Excellence speaking. Tomorrow is the day off. I introduce a new official holiday. Invention! Well, to work! When the whole legion of you will spawn, nobody will be able to resist... Sleep well, dear boys. You are the only hope. See you in nine months. Mother Nature is on our side. Hold on, guys. The right of nature must win. This is only a question of time. Hold on, guys!
