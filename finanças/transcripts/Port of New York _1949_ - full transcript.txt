subtitle by: Mehrdad Arghavani This is the Port of New York. For the regular traveler, it is an impressive landscape. it is a symbol of hope. For the trader, is the biggest port in the world. a battlefield, ...a battle being waged against the illegal trade... ...and against the gangs organized gangs who dedicate themselves... ...to the smuggling of narcotics. is the Aduanas office... ...of the Department of the Treasury Department. It is your job to examine goods and baggage... ...so that no smuggling into the country. use many tricks. have to know everyone, ...the old, the new and a few more. But despite the vigilance, ...drugs continue to enter into the United States. The government archives are full of cases... ...related to the fight against drug trafficking. One of the most spectacular was... ...the case of the S.S. Florentine. The S.S. Florentine was approaching New York Harbor... ...on the night of June 22. It was only a few miles from the coast. At 3:30 am... ...a passenger came out for cover. His name was Toni Cardell. at 10 a.m. Not long after they put up the catwalk... ...and the passengers began disembarking. Among them was Toni Cardell. passed through customs. nothing suspicious. It was a simple routine inspection. I can't understand it, Paul. There was no reason to kill him! He said he would take care of it, ...but I didn't say anything about stabbing him. Explains in a very repulsive very repulsive way. You are falling into ridicule. You must not let yourself be dominated by emotions. It is depressing. Sit back and relax. Nobody said anything about murder! I would never have accepted something like that! Why did you kill him? I couldn't let him loose in New York. I couldn't take the chance that arrest. I'm scared, Paul! I don't want to be implicated in a murder! Too late! What do you want me to do? Take me away, Paul. To Rio, just as we planned. Anywhere, until things calm down! No, dear. It is impossible. Paul, what is going on? I don't know you, what about you? What is the problem? Honey, don't do this to me! I did what you asked, why do you stay like this? Please don't make it a problem. Okay, Paul, if you won't get me out out of here, give me money. I need at least 25,000 dollars. Will they be enough? For you, this is nothing! The shipment was worth 50 times more! In time, yes. But I'm not selling it yet. I can't wait, I have to leave now! They saw me talking to the steward! steward! I danced with him, I had to! They will know and they will interrogate me! I'm afraid to say something inconvenient! It is true! I might say something inconvenient. What is it? No one who should scare you, darling. They will pick up the merchandise at the Pennsylvania station. Okay, wait in the other room. Here, the $25,000 that Stasser charged Conny. That's all, Lenny. I had said I would not sell! It is a special case, I am going to Canada. - I need money. - Me too! I can't give you any more money! Don't get hysterical, I can't stand it! You looked for the other one, didn't you? Who is it this time? A chambermaid? A poor girl taken from the gutter? It's getting uncomfortable as usual as usual... ...meddling where it doesn't belong! I'm getting to know you, Paul. He attaches himself to a humble girl and then... ...throws it in the trash, just for have fun! It's getting boring! Please go away! I would give anything to be there... ...to see your arrogance on the ground... ...the day they put him in jail! When the passengers had disembarked, ...unloaded the goods from the Florentine. There was a legal shipment of raw narcotics ...to a laboratory in New Jersey... ...who refined them for medicinal use. It was a registered submission, ...but it was held up at customs... ...because an inspector discovered a difference... ...between the declared weight and the actual weight of the goods shipped. to open the box. In place of narcotics in raw form, ...so necessary for doctors and hospitals, ...the box only contained sand. They gave the alarm. Soon arrived the brigade special brigade arrived... ...from the Central Customs Office. Your orders were to search the ship... ...and find the missing narcotics. An inspector met with the captain of the Florentine. searched the entire ship, ...from bow to stern... ...and from keel to mast. On learning that the crew member responsible for the shipment had disappeared, ...the inspector informed his superiors. A few minutes later, ...Agent Michael Waters has been assigned to the case... ...and got to work. First of all, it was necessary to gather all possible information... ...aboard the Florentine. A ship's officer said that the foreman... ...I knew the combination of the safe... ...where narcotics were kept. Suspicions increased when it was discovered... ...that his documentation had also had also disappeared. In addition, there was a missing lifeboat was missing. Waters had it inspected the entire harbor. They called another section of the Treasury Department. The coast guard sent their speedboats. They traced the harbor and its surroundings, ...but with little success. The evidence indicated that the stolen narcotics... ...had been landed in the United States. El caso Florentine has taken on greater importance. And another section of the Treasury Department... ...intervened in the case. The Florentine case was already a joint operation... ...the Bureau of Customs and the Bureau of Narcotics. We have to ask help from Washington. I need a special agent, in a case like this. Sorry for the intrusion, sir, but... ...what about Jim Flannery? You have just solved a difficult case. I assigned him to a bureaucratic bureaucratic work. Bureaucratic? I can't imagine myself behind a desk. It is the only way to get you to rest. You two have already worked together, no? Yes, in the Exeter case, two years ago. We make a good team. Call Jim Flannery and Sam Harrison. Feeling better, Waters? Working with Flannery you learn a lot. It is a difficult case, I wish you luck. Why, the customs officer! Glad to see you! Where have you been all this time? Behind a desk, between papers. - And what do you do? - Well... Jim, I have a job for you. A new case. Thank you. The Florentine case? - It's very important. - I know, I read the reports. When they refine the drug, ...could take more than a million dollars. We have to catch them before they distribute it. First you have to find the drug. It won't be easy. Come in, Sam. This is Harrison. He'll be working with you. - Good. - How are you, Jim? - Do you know Waters? - Yes, hello, Mick. Hi, Sam. The Florentine case, Sam. Update it, Waters. The only clue is the is the disappearance of the crew member. He has no prior record. We are investigating passengers and crew members. No success, so far. - It's no big deal. - It's in the crew member in charge. If we find it, we will know something more. Let's ask the usual offenders. I don't think it will do much good this time, Jim. You have to find out if the drug is in the city... ...and if anyone has seen the crew member in charge of the warehouse. - Okay, Jim, go ahead. - Good. We will make the search as possible. We will stop informants and dealers. Maybe we will find out something. We will start from scratch. We are looking for a guy who looks like ten thousand others. Yes. But we know one thing. It went that way. In a city of several million inhabitants, ...had to find a man. The stolen goods from the S.S. Florentine... ...it was not normal smuggling. It was a deadly shipment. So they had to organize a raid... ...all over the city. The shipment would bring with it destruction, ...an epidemic of violence and misery. There would be men who would kill to get it... ...or that they would die for to be with him. Whoever kept it has destroyed himself. Time was of the essence. I had to stop the plague from spreading. They searched tirelessly for a man, ...day and night! Until a barge dredger... ...put an end to the search. of the missing tri-puller appears. WILL BE INTERROGATED. This is the list of passengers and crew. - It could be one of them. - Or none. You have to check every name. Come in. On the phone a woman who wants to to talk about the Florentine. - Who is it? - You don't want to say your name. My name is Flannery, you can talk to me. How much do you pay for information about drugs? Well... it depends! What is it all about? From a shipment of... sand. The Government gives 25% of of the recovered value. Come to my office. No, it is impossible! I'll expect you in in half an hour... ...on the platform of the Canal Street station. I am wearing a gray dress with white collar and cuffs. ...and a gray hat. Gray dress, white collar and cuffs white, gray hat. - Who are you? - Flannery, and you? It doesn't matter. He told me that he would pay for the information. That's why I came! Tell me about the loading of the Florentine. I know where some of it is. When will you give me the money? When we have the evidence. Did you say "a part"? Well, I... I don't know where the rest is. But I can help you find it! I mean, if you... We will pay, don't worry. Where did you get this information? An acquaintance of mine... That is, that you know some of the implicated. I need the money as soon as possible. - You promised me! - That depends on you. You will have it when we get the evidence. You will have it today before the night. What is the name of this... ...known to you? You have to tell us everything you know... ...about the shipment, names, addresses, anything you know! I'll have to find out. I need more time! I will call you later at your office. This very afternoon. If you are afraid, we can protect you. protect you. No! I am not afraid. I will call you later. What is the name of the woman who just walked in? Have you no shame? You should work, instead of loafing! I will start work when I know her name. It is very important. Well, if you insist. His name is Toni Cardell. Apartment 5-A. At your age I would have gotten it without paying. Paul! Sounds like a surprise! As if you didn't expect to see me again! I didn't expect it! But I am glad that you have come! I never needed you so much you so much! I am sorry for what I said to you. Really! I am sorry. Me too. Forgive me, right? You came here directly, leaving my house? Yes, of course. Why do you ask? I wondered if you had entertained... ...along the way. What nonsense! It is ten minutes from my house to yours. I have been calling you for an hour and a half. I was not at home. I held back during the subway ride. At the station. And he lost his ticket. I didn't buy it! You have been very ungrateful, Toni. Very ungrateful. I wish you would come with me, Paul. Tell me, Toni. Where do you plan to go? To the west coast, ...and then wherever you can. Come with me, we'll start again. Come with me! I'm sorry, I can't. But I will miss you. I am very worried, Paul. - I don't know what to do. - You worry me too. It worries me a lot. What do you mean? You are scared, you are nervous, and you're lying. I don't lie, I swear! You are a risk, Toni. An intolerable risk! An intolerable risk. - Since when did you know her? - Since you moved here. - Flannery, from Narcotics. - Waters, from Aduanas. - Devers, from Homicide. - It is her, no doubt. - You were being watched, right? - That's it. I replaced Mickey at 1:00 a.m, a lot of people came and went... ...until the police arrived. It could have been anyone. - Who found her? - The maid, at two o'clock. She hasn't been dead for more than more than two hours. An hour and a half. She was strangled, but there are no wire or finger marks. Did you find drugs? No, but we are searching the whole apartment. There are no drugs here. Her friends would take her after of strangling her. Hey, Jim! Here is her passport, you can blame me. There was no reason to to arrest her. Pick up, Jane. Hello? No, who do I talk to? From the Pennsylvania station. - Ask what they want. - I'll take a message. At six? Just a moment. Cardell reserved a seat on the six o'clock train. Let me speak. This is the police, where was was Miss Cardell going? I understand, thank you. Cancel the reservation. Two hours ago you booked a ticket for the six... ...on the train from Chicago to Los Angeles. I could have run away before, if I didn't want to see you. I think he wanted to see me and then take the train. Sam, tell the lieutenant we know. - Maybe they will find something. - Okay. Mick and I are going to station in Pennsylvania. Attention, please. The train number 9, ...bound for Gurvenor, Norwork, ...Philadelphia, Baltimore, ...and Washington, ...will leave platform 7. Toni Cardell did not arrive for his meeting with Flannery. Now it was up to them to figure out what they were going to do. What would your plans be? in his apartment, ...but I thought I would deliver them before six. If you were thinking of taking the the road, ...death had erased the track. If they were at the station, had to find her. have given them the master key... ...and helped them search... ...a needle in a haystack. It could be anywhere anywhere in the station, ...on consignment, in the rental compartments, ...obvious places, but had to inspect them. The agents, like the offenders, ...did you know that the obvious places are the safest. They opened the compartments one by one. They examined the packages that might contain drugs... ...out of sight of the curious, ...in the office of the Station Chief's office. We already have. It looks pure! Give me an envelope. There are no fingerprints on the container, Jim. What do you plan to do? Send a sample to the laboratory. It's very good for an vulgar. If it is pure, maybe it comes from above. Thank you for lending us the master key. This package never left the compartment. - Agreed? - Yes. Attention, please. The passengers on the sleeper train "Silver Blazer", ...train number 48, ...bound for Pittsbury and Chicago, ...confirm your reservation... ...at the announcement desk... ...from port 4. So far we have been lucky. You just have to wait and see what happens. If Toni Cardell left the package, nothing will happen. But if the traffickers let them, ...will come for you sooner or later. Thank you, you are wonderful. I want to continue and I will. This is my favorite. I'm Captain Bligh and I'm going aboard the Bounty. Mr. Christian. Mr. Christian, come here! Who is at the top of the mast, ...swinging like a pendulum? Let him down right now or I'll have you hanged ...on the biggest mast of the British Navy. Thank you very much. And now I have the pleasure to to present to you... ...our three beauties beauties. A big round of applause for them! It was about time. Dolly, you were magnificent tonight! I am always magnificent. And you, come with me! Sorry, I have things to do. Did you come with a bad leg? - He left an hour ago! - I didn't say it was urgent. What a way to treat mail! Who are you? - They are not from here! - Federal agents. What's up, Dolly? What are you doing here? - Who are you? - Little Red Riding Hood! This is not a joke. I'm Lily Long, I work here. - Is he your boyfriend? - Don't even think about it! I'm just a good friend. Get dressed, miss. You're coming with us. Leave her alone, the girl doesn't know anything! Only dancing in the club! - She doesn't know anything! - We'll see. Who sent you to pick up the package? Him. The owner told me to go see Dolly Conny. Dolly is he. He gave me a key and told me to go to the station. - Was the girl present? - No, we were alone. What's in it, stolen jewelry? Sit down and wait, someone will come for you. will come for you. Don't let yourself be dominated, Dolly, you have no right! Stay out of it. Look, she doesn't know anything, I don't want to complicate it! - Okay, let it stay. - Thank you! But maybe we want to talk with you, don't disappear! Okay. Room T-17, apartments Carnavan, Wall Street. - Do you live there, Conny? - You make a mistake. I don't do this anymore, I was doing a favor for a guy. - A guy I don't know! - Make up another excuse. - We don't believe it. - Come on, Conny. We will talk while we search your house. You are making a mistake! Do a guy a favor! Come on, Dolly. What is going on here? Is there a problem? - Too many for your taste. - Oh yeah? I'm Joey Leone, and this is my place! You can't arrest him without a court order! Get on with your work and stay out of trouble. Will you walk away or shall I walk away from you? They can't do that to me, I know my rights! Joey, we have to help him! What can we do? I don't know and I don't think getting into it. You could lose the club! But we have to do something! If you would like to help, please call this phone number. He told me that I could call. What are you doing with my things? Stop, don't continue! - I will press charges! - That's enough, Conny. Let's start again at the beginning the beginning! We want to know two things. For whom did you buy and who bought? They are very wrong, I swear it. Then correct us! Well, what happened was the following. A guy came from Canada. I wanted pure drugs, in quantity. Let's get down to details, what is this guy's name? Okay. I have no reason to protect him. His name is Jarroms, and he is at the Chevy Chase hotel. It's getting better, have a cigarette. Go on, Conny, it interests me. I said I had retired. That I would let you know if knew anything. And I heard something. As a matter of fact. I met casually with an old an old acquaintance. He told me that he had 750 g of pure dope. I wanted to sell it for $25,000. What is it called? I don't know! I don't know, I ignore it! The dealers don't say your name! Where did you meet him "casually"? Last Wednesday, Lil and I went to watch ...a baseball game. I can't imagine you in baseball, try something else! Why not? I like baseball! Really? What about boat shows? Two tickets to the Palacio Nautical, for Wednesday. Bad custom, save the entries. Yes, I went to the boat show, so what? There he met with Mr. No Name. Yes. - What did you go there for? - I wanted to buy a yacht. Noble ambition, Conny. All right, Conny, let's go. Let's go back to Mr. No Name! - What does he look like? - Like many guys! - Tall, thin... - Where can we find him? I don't know, I haven't seen him in years! I swear. No drug trail, Jim. They destroyed my house. - I will report you! - Let's go downtown. Perhaps you remember the the man from the exhibition. I couldn't! And I have never seen him, I don't even know his name! Look, look for Jarroms. - I'll testify against him! - We'll get him, Dolly. But we are more interested in the man of the exhibition. Perhaps you remember the name in my office. - Lily Long? - Yes. - I am Stasser. - You can help Dolly. Perhaps, what do you know about this subject? Just what I told him over the phone. They followed the messenger to the club. ...and they took Dolly. - Is that all? - That's all. We have to let Dolly go. - You said there is someone. - There is. - Will you post bail? - I'll take you to him. - Did you bring it? - It's there, but I don't like it. She is allied with Conny, I don't trust her. - What do you suggest? - Conny can say anything. It is dangerous. I will decide that. I'm Lilly Long. I'm sorry I waited. It doesn't matter, when I called, I didn't know you. I didn't know that Dolly had friends. ...like this! What is your relationship with Mr. Conny? We are good friends. He gave me the job at the club! You will help him, won't you? I will do it when necessary. I'll pour you a drink while you keep telling me ...about our friend Conny. I want to help you because... ...it was not his fault! I wanted to do someone a favor. - It was for someone else! - Someone else? Do you have any idea who it might be? I wish you knew! You have no idea. If we get Dolly out of jail, ...maybe he will tell me! I see. Will you help him? I couldn't bear to go to jail! - No? - No, understand it. He is not very strong. If they arrest him, it could fall apart. That would be a shame. Will you do something? Will you help him? Don't worry, dear. Don't worry. Post Conny's bail. You have to get out as soon as possible. - And the girl? - She is harmless. Our problem is your friend Conny. It chooses its partners very badly. Go ahead, for your own safety... ...try to be more cautious. We will do what we can for your friend Conny. Let me out of here! We caught the Canadian, he denies everything. - You are lying! - We can't prove it. You will be the scapegoat. This is a very serious crime, Dolly! It is your fault. You are lying, I don't plan to go to jail to jail for anyone! Don't do that! We want the guy who sold you the drugs! Who is it? You have to let me out! I need help! I have to get out of here, you can't do this to me! You who searched. We want the head of the operation. If it turns out that you are in the middle, your bad luck. We are waiting, Dolly. I am thirsty. This is not enough for me! Say something. Say something, please. Now it is up to you to speak. - Stasser. - What? Leo Stasser sold me the drug. Where is this Stasser? He owns of some shipyards... ...at Harbor Point. God, give me a break! You have to help me! Sam, get the doctor, take care of him. While the doctor arrives, continue with the story. Where are the shipyards? On Marine Row. On the main pier. Harbor Point. It is not a cheap construction. Yes, it is a ghost company, they work hard! If Conny didn't invent this Stasser. It has to be checked, and fast! Let's get closer. Look at that poster. BOAT OF LESS THAN 40 FEET Our boat needs an overhaul, don't you think? an overhaul, don't you think? I'm going to get in there and work on it! - Never mind, it won't be that easy. - It will be sewing and singing! You have to find the drug before they transfer it! I won't let you risk your neck. He never worked undercover. I learned something, I have a good teacher! It is better that I do that. Do you know anything about boats? - That's the front and that's the back. - That would be just fine! I will get you in. All right! - Can I have a cigarette? - Yes, take it! Thank you! Are they the big shots? It's the boss, Mr. Stasser! Stasser, eh? Have you lost your way, friend? That's right, I'm looking for the water disperser. Look harder, it's down there. Thank you. It will take an hour to get out. Let's go. The workshop and the warehouse are downstairs. I've come this far, but I was discovered. Hold this. Here it is. The equipment needed to refine the pure drug. They feel very safe, they refine it right here. Conny was right. Stasser deals in drugs. Jim. I'm going downstairs, take charge the office. Okay. I will buy the shipment "F", a man named Wyley... ...will fly to New York and will identify himself. Your friend, Y. A man named Wyley. - What are you doing here? - You heard! What are you doing here? I have a boat out there, I need parts to trade! You are lying! - Come on, talk! - Okay, I will! I come from Canada. I made a deal with Dolly Conny. Conny, huh? Go on, what about him? I put up $25,000. ...but I don't have the drug! He told me that you operate here. Keep talking! I thought I would take some of Leo's of Leo's drugs. Dirty thief! Hold it, let's take a look. Maybe he came with a friend. friend. Let's get this over with outside, come on! No, if we take it to the boss... maybe you want to say something else! Yes, take me to the boss. That's who I want to talk to, precisely. Okay, let's go! The boss will ask himself how many friends Conny has... ...and what he told them! has been found These are your things. That's all he carried with him. You will have to take your family with you. I'll take it, I was thinking of going anyway. Are you sure, Jim? I can send another one. No matter, I will go. It's not much, is it? That. Three lines from page 27. Nothing about the kind of person he was. Not even his name. The case is still open, we cannot say who it was. Many end up like this. But the case is not yet closed. We have to solve it, and there is only one chance left. - Wyley? - Let me try. We could not prepare a convincing story. No need, they don't know Wyley. I don't want any more killing. Would you go through Wyley? We don't know who is sending it nor how much you plan to buy. We will never know, from the outside. We can take Stasser and make him talk. There are thousands like him, another would take his place. - We want the boss. - Of course. Do you know if Wyley was going to deal with him? Yes Wyley it's me, you'll have to accept. There is no time, we only know that Wyley will come by plane. John, it's about a million million dollars worth of drugs. With the tenth part, there would be several murders. More people would die. We have to stop this. Let me intercept Wyley on the plane. The San Francisco office went into action. If Wyley were to try to leave of travel, ...they would know. All airlines and travel agency. named Wyley. You will book a plane ticket to New York City. All employees have been notified. Each passage has been examined carefully. Finally, Wyley bought a ticket to New York. Agent Carey, of San Francisco, ...followed in his footsteps. INDIVIDUAL "Y" IS AL YOXIE, a drug trafficker. 624 TO THE EAST COAST. MINUTES IN CHICAGO. The stopover in Chicago was just the agents needed. When Wyley got off the plane, ...and before you could talk to anyone, ...has been arrested by the authorities... ...and led to an office. We know all about you, Wyley. I was going to New York to buy the Florentine shipment. It is better for you tell us everything. I don't know what you are talking about, I am on vacation. It will be a very big vacation, believe me. But you can make be shorter. We are wasting time, my plane leaves in a few minutes! Your journey ends here, Wyley, you have to talk! No comments. - What did you find, guys? - Fake clothes and documents. - No money? - No. You would have to pay in cash! There are only credit cards and this photo. The one on the right is Al Yoxie. Keep him incommunicado, Carey and I are going into town. The technicians from the Treasury Department... ...had to be thoroughly employed. In a short time, Flannery had begun... ...turning into Wyley. In a few minutes, ...Flannery learned the Al Yoxie's history, ...an important trafficker from the West Coast. But despite his efforts, ...they still had no clue. They knew nothing of Wyley. For the substitution was successful, ...Flannery would have to improvise. It will need more than luck. That afternoon, when Flannery landed in New York, ...was a man named Wyley... ...who landed. Passengers on Flight 219, ...bound for Chicago and Los Angeles, ...board through gate 5. Is there a message for Mr. Wyley? Passengers on Flight 19 bound for Los Angeles, ...board through gate 5. turn around, ...AND GENTLE THE FRONT WITH A LENCH. Passengers are requested to Yordly and Jackobson... ...to appear at the counter of the Transnational Company. The passengers on Flight 127, from Hawaii, ...San Francisco and Los Angeles, ...will exit through gate 7. The narcotics agent who was watching Flannery... ...reported the success of the first contact. Superintendent Meredith and his men could only... ...hope and trust that Flannery would continue forward, ...without being discovered, ...until it finds the Florentine's shipment. Then you would give the signal. Until this moment, Flannery would take the risk alone. Yes? What? When? Why weren't we consulted before releasing him? They released Dolly Conny. You will go directly see Stasser. If you see Jim, we are lost. They are true friends! Tell who posted my bail. - I will never forget it. - You will rejoice to know that. Thank you for bringing me, you did me a favor! - Where are you going? - I'll come up with you. - Why? - We have to talk. Those guys destroyed my house! What did you tell them when you were in jail? I didn't say anything, Leo, I swear! Another will have snitched, I did not! You bailed me out! I was told it was a friend, I thought it was you! friend, I thought it was you! What did you tell the police? The same as the Canadian? I didn't tell them anything! And what is that about a Canadian? Leo! What are you going to do, Leo? I didn't tell them anything! Suicide? Aren't you wrong? I understand. Thank you. PAUL...? SPORTS PORT OF NORTH RIVER. I am Stasser. My pleasure. - You are late. - I'm sorry. I had problems along the way. I missed the plane. Al Yoxie sends his regards. Sit down, Wyley. We can close the deal now, bring the money? I haven't seen the goods yet. I follow orders, I will not buy here. You are right! - We can close the deal now. - Of course we can. When we see the 200,000 dollars. - We want the money now, Wyley. - I don't have it on me. - Where is it? - I'm not taking it with me. I'm not that stupid. I don't want to end up as the crew member in charge! It is a trap. You will have the money when I talk to the boss. How do you know it's not me? I only know what I was told. Yoxie said nothing of the sort in her letter! By letter, of course not! I follow orders. If you don't talk to the boss, there is no business. That it doesn't move. Sit down. At the headquarters of the special brigade, ...the Treasury agents were waiting the combined signal. They couldn't do anything until they got paid. But they knew that the situation was getting more dangerous... ...with each passing minute. You are very stubborn, Mr. Wyley. It wasn't going to come with 200,000 dollars. - You could have an accident. - Accidents are frequent. Let's speak clearly. You've seen the merchandise and I want the money. You will have it here in 15 minutes. - I have to make a phone call. - A phone call? To whom? Our contact has the money. Are you waiting for me to say that the deal is right. - Nobody told me. - He was supposed to bring the money. Would you have brought it? We will do it your way, ...for now. But if this is a trick, ...you and your friends will regret it. - Where is the phone? - On the pier. One moment. Ike. What is the number to call? Call this number. Tell them to send a messenger with the money in a box, ...to the municipal wharf of Brooklyn. We will be there in 40 minutes. Brooklyn Pier, 40 minutes. Why not bring him here? On a municipal wharf you can't violence can't be used. And you complain that we ...are we cautious? Yes? I call from Wyley. Right! Brooklyn Municipal Wharf. Tell Wyley that you will be there. I received a message from Flannery. Brooklyn Pier, 40 minutes. All right, Sam, let's go! The money will be there. - Get ready, let's go. - Right away. Put the drug in Mr. Wyley's Mr. Wyley's briefcase. If all goes well, we will leave at the pier. You have a visitor. Of course, I will investigate what happened. What a coincidence, Little Red! - Hello! - Glad to see you! - Did you know each other? - Yes. We have a friend in common! What are you doing here? We are partners in a business. Mr. Wyley and I have to talk. If you will excuse us, it will only take a moment. - It's lovely. - Yes. Little Red Riding Hood! You know her better than I do! We have known each other for a few months, ...on my last trip to this city. You have the advantage. She seemed uncomfortable to see Mr. Wyley. Just surprised. He told me that it had been years that they hadn't seen each other for years. I'll be with you in a moment. Lenny, make us some drinks. When you reach the bay, head to the high seas. Before attending the meeting, ...I want to clarify a few things. They would have to be here by now. There must have been problems. Give me the phone. Car 23, over. Meredith speaking. The yacht didn't come. Tell the coast guard to look for him. How interesting! We are gathered here... ...and you already knew each other. When did you say you met? I have another question. Why aren't we at the pier? Do you want to change the subject? You said 40 minutes, what's going on? Good question, what is going on? You don't seem to like the cruise, honey. Lenny will pour you another drink. No, thank you. I see lights in the stern, someone is following us. Lenny. Take the girl. - Lock her up. - Let's go. What are you doing? Let me go! Don't be stupid, I advise you! This is Dolly's ring. - You murdered him! - Take her away! And you, Mr. Wyley, or whatever your name is, ...if you hadn't arrested Dolly, he would be alive! Arrested? Don't let it move! Keep an eye on Lenny. Mr. Wyley leaves the boat. We will miss you, and the drugs too. Everything will be in order when our "guests" arrive. Sit down. With the capture of the head... ...the gang was disbanded. The Florentine case has been closed. But there will be other problems, other missions. The data and facts were archived, ...but not everything is included in the government reports. These are the men who defend... ...the entry into North America, ...the Port of New York. subtitle by: Mehrdad Arghavani
