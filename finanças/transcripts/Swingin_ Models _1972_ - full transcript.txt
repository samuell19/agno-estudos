(dramatic orchestral music) (upbeat jazz music) - Beautiful baby. When I think how uptight you were when you started. - Are we finished? - Yep. Which stud in you stable are you taking for a ride today? - This time I happen to love him. - Don't tell me he's the man of your life. I suppose the fact that he's a handsome, divorced billionaire didn't influence your affections. Real love at first sight. - I love him. - Oh, naturally. - [Woman] Who is that? - She's no competition, so calm down. I just want to try her out. - In bed? - No, on the sofa. Come on, get out. So, get a nice hard-on? I want a first class performance. One orgasm more, and you can go back to your job in the front window, okay? Oh, what do my astonished eyes behold? She who seeks, shall find, so thought your predecessor. Now, button up your sporting friend, would you? Can you tell me the reason why male window dummies having nothing inside their pants? - Don't they? I never had the honor of undressing one. - Okay, listen sweetheart, enough of that virginal routine. Use a little more sophistication. Do it, like so. Capisce? Now what's wrong, inspiration lacking today? I'm waiting. - Oh, for what? - What I hired you for. I put it very plainly in the newspaper ad, plain and unmistakable, didn't I? - Yes. - Yes yes yes, what does that mean? - I just can't. - And why not? Don't you like his excellency? - No. - Despite his millions? - Despite his millions. - And what do you say to that, your excellency? What? His excellency is frightfully offended, but he's willing to hire you as his secretary for $69 a session. - Okay, tell him I gladly accept his offer. - You wouldn't have any special skills? - No. - No? - No. You're crazy. - What do you say to these Himalayan peaks, your excellency? Sorry? Oh, at the most they're the Alps? Well, I beg your pardon? Oh, you'd like to go to bed with her? Who wouldn't? You'll give her a little diamond, in advance? Oh, you're so generous, your excellency. What? And a lovely penthouse, a new Rolls Royce? And wedding bells. Congratulations, your fortune is made. - Please let go of me now. - Forget the ungrateful bitch. - I don't want to be a whore, that's all there is to it. I'm not going to be another filthy picture hidden in a drawer to give a few horny old men vicarious pleasures, I think it's disgusting. - Which one is the most disgusting? - That one. - Interesting. So you don't want a career like that? - I don't. - Or like hers, or hers, or hers? - No, I don't. And while we're on the subject of my qualifications, allow me to say this, that window dummy has more in his pants than you do. - You can't blame me for trying to find out if you have the right kind of equipment. Say, how about going with me to a party tonight? And you'll have a good chance to see what a tragic end is in store for these women who have made bed a career. - You have nothing else to offer me than an evening out with a lot of cheap whores and pimps? (soft jazz xylophone) (engine revving) I'd never imagine a bordello would look like this. - Live and learn. Go on in. Come on, don't be shy. (bright xylophone music) As you'd expect, everybody here is a hustler. I think we'd better circulate and take part in this sordid game, the lovely world of sex and money. Hello, Suzanne. - Felix. - Oh, listen angel, think you can shake a few dollars out of Branken's fat pockets for our next super porno work of art? - Don't you call me angel, and second-- - Yes and second? - And second, I don't finance any porno works of art. - Bravo, bravo, bravo. I'm sorry, then how's your porno business? Hello Erica. - Felix, what a pleasure, I'm so glad to see you. - Apparently, oh by the way, I see your husband has gone in for developing motion picture talents? - Why not? Suzanne's worked very hard on herself. - Oh yes, and they worked very hard on her, too. As they say, the harder the better. Madame looks absolutely ravishing. Hamster? Or maybe, pussy? Very becoming though. - Come on, you can cut out the comedy Sardin, that's real Canadian mink. - The devil it is, you know I'm blind as a bat, go on. - Well, how's the cynical reporter? And who is this fabulous creature you brought with you tonight? - You have to find another toy, Consul. Astrid hates rich men. You wouldn't have a little office work for her? - No, I'm sorry, have you got any special skills? - No. - We're parched. Where's the barrel of vodka? Oh, what I behold warms the very cockles of my heart. The can-opener of high society. - Thanks for prying me out of the clutches of that old letcher. - To vice. Oh, maybe I should tell you, that old letcher is our host this evening. Consul Schmidts. He's worth about six to eight million. He regards wealth much as Jesus did, when he said, it is far better to give than to receive, which means he's a man who to a great extent, uses his money to enjoy to the full the pleasures of life. In only one area does he encounter problems, sex. Already married four times, then four times divorced. It's rumored that, while he can offer women all the goodies of this world, he can't offer them anything in bed. For example, his hot affair a year ago with Christine. He got to know her at a gambling casino, and had no trouble making her acquaintance. Christine could smell a rich man a hundred miles away, and had played partner in the vice to quite a few. Consul Schmidts immediately gave her the impression of being an extraordinarily generous fellow. - Please, don't go. You brought me good luck. This is for you. I'd like to show my gratitude. And please don't say that you can't accept it. - All right, I'll take it. I had absolutely no luck this evening. Some days are like that. I think I really ought to get out. - Poppycock. - I'm warning you, they're your chips I'll be losing. - No, they're not, they're yours. What did I tell you? See, you won. Shall we try again? - [Dealer] Place your bets please. - Excuse me, I should have introduced myself to you. Schmidts. - Consul Schmidts, I know. - Oh really? - I saw you once on television. My name is Christine. (laughing) That's enough Consul, I can't take anymore. My nose is running. - Just one more, listen. A gentleman is walking out on a lady. - Please not here, Consul. Not here. - Where? - Where? I must say you work very fast. I like a country house. Small outside, elegant inside. Where can a lady powder her nose, Consul? - Don't call me Consul all the time please, just call me Hugo. - Hugo? - I know, my dear parents had no imagination. - Very well Hugo, where can a lady powder her nose? - Over there in the bathroom. I hope you won't keep me waiting for you too long. - You're that hungry for me, Hugo? - Time to go to work, wake up. - Oh, okay. - Wake up! I have another assignment for you. - Oh no, that's twice this week. All right, where is she? - In the bathroom, powdering her nose. - I hope at least she's pretty. - You'll be happy with her. - All right, whenever I think of the last one. Has the lady been told? - No. Hurry. - So it's, it's the same old routine? - As usual. - You disgust me, Christine. Your technique's amateur and primitive. Whatever happens, better not fail me sweetheart. The Consul's the gateway to the easy life. - Oh, hello. - Hello. Who are you? The junior Consul? - No, the Consul's guest. Anything I can do for you? - No. (laughing) Now that I think of it, yes. Would you help me unhook my dress? - Of course, it's an honor. - Are you always that awkward? - I could do it without these on. - Anyone can do that. Is there a bathrobe somewhere around here? - Yes, in the bathroom, wait. I'll go get it. - I'd rather, don't bother. Please keep working, stay nice and fit. (soft jazz music) Hugo, Hugo, you're a very big disappointment. - Oh, forgive me dear. May I ask why? - Tell me who's the nude man in the torture chamber. - Torture chamber? - Who is he? - Oh, you mean Roy. - What's he doing here? - He's living with me for a while. - And I thought you were anxious to spend the evening with me alone. - Roy won't get in our way unless-- - Unless? - We invite him to join us. - Hugo, Hugo. I think you have evil thoughts. - Roy's a very charming boy. They say three is a lot more fun. - That depends on what you mean by having fun. All right, invite your charming little boy, Hugo. - Well? - Things are moving. Come on, get dressed. - That would be a shame. - Roy, this is Christine. - Our boxer is bashful, how sweet. - Consul, kindly inform the young lady that I'm neither bashful nor a boxer. - He's a rock and roll singer. - Am I supposed to know him? - He's just starting to become known and I'm handling him. - How generous. - I cut my first phonograph record this morning. Everyone is unanimously convinced that, that it's going to be a hit. - What's the title? - The Wind. - Well, don't keep us in suspense, put the tape on the player, Roy. - Unfortunately, all I've got's the playback. - What's that? - The playback? That's the music track without the voice. I'll record the lyrics next week. - What a pity. - Would you really like to listen to it? - Yes. - Okay. Would you please play it, Consul? And I'll run through the lyrics. - What's the tape speed? - Seven and a half. (soft acoustic guitar) ♪ The wind, the wind howls all night long ♪ ♪ I hear its lonely song ♪ ♪ The wind is calling anxiously ♪ ♪ It's calling you to me ♪ ♪ The wind, the wind sings its lonely song ♪ ♪ It sings it sings you belong to me ♪ ♪ The wind, the wind howls all night long ♪ ♪ It sings, it sings its lonely song ♪ (rock music) - Open up. (knocking on door) Open that door Roy, open up, that's an order. Open up, or I'll break the door down. - Go screw yourself Consul, today we're playing with different rules. - That's a violation of our agreement. - This one appeals to me. - You filthy double-crosser, you ten cent stud. I'll throw you out along with that whore. (film projector whirring) (soft jazz music) - [Felix] Yes, Christine and Roy chose sexual freedom. Christine was faced with a choice, a rich old man, or a young pop singer with a future. She chose the latter, and so far as I've heard, did the right thing. Poor rich Consul Schmidts. - Actually, it's very nice here. Thank you very much for inviting me. - What's this? I thought you were against whore parties. - You have such a crude vocabulary. That lady there, don't tell me she used to be a whore. - [Felix] One of the best. - [Astrid] She looks so normal. - [Felix] Don't they all? - [Astrid] What about that other one? I think I've met her somewhere. Her face is very familiar. - Out of the question. Missus Von Branken moves only in the most elegant and exclusive circles these days. - I guess I'm mistaken. But she looks like a sweet person. - You change your mind as often as your panties. - I never wear them. - Oh no, I'll file that for reference. Want to see something? - Who's that? - Missus Von Branken. Her maiden name was Limburger. She was engaged to a very nice young man. At the time I had this nude picture of her printed in a magazine. Branken was still married then. And he and his wife spent some sleepless nights over her. - Say that again please. Listen to this Peter. - My husband saw her. It was love at first sight. Then he pulled her into the lower bunk, ripped away the sheets, and then lay down beside her. - And then? - What happened then, Walter? - Then I felt terribly embarrassed because I was all dressed and you were all naked. - Didn't I have anything on? - No. Like Eve in the Garden of Eden, as if God had just finished making you. - I don't find that story very amusing. - Peter. - If you keep an eye on my man, I'll keep an eye on yours. - Peter and I are engaged to be married. - Don't worry about him. - Peter, wait a second. Don't you think that I have good reason to be jealous, too? - Erica never breathed a word to me about that revolting episode. - She couldn't have told you, because you can bet your last dollar she was also getting laid by another thousand men in town. - That's very comforting. - When a girl like Erica has a nude picture on a magazine cover, she's bound to get up in the world. - That damn magazine picture, it's nauseating. Well have a nice evening. - Hey, wait a second, where are you going? - I'm going home. - It's too early to go to sleep yet. I've got a terrific idea, let's go to my house and relax. Would that please you? Walter will come later with Erica, and the engaged couple can have a reconciliation. I'll go get my coat. (upbeat jazz music) - No, I don't think it's a good idea, because if Peter caught us, he'd go crazy and cut our heads off. He's dreadfully jealous, you know. - Yes, so would I be if you were my fiance. - I would really like to know where Peter's gone to. - And my wife's disappeared, as well. - You mean they've gone off together? - Oh why not? An angry young man is hard for my wife to resist. But I wouldn't be surprised if we found them both at my house, consoling each other. - You mean that? - I'm almost sure. Come on, let's get another drink. - My name's Sylvia. - Peter. - Want another? - No thanks, I've got to drive later. - Oh a little one, that can't hurt you. - All right. You really believe your husband'll bring her back here? - I've often given comfort to lonely young men. My husband knows that. And somehow I've the feeling that you're in need of comfort, too. - Not comfort, I simply can't get used to the idea that so many men keep trying to make the woman that I intend to marry all because of that nude picture. - Why did she pose for that picture? - Career, she wants a big career. Every time I hear the word, I feel like vomiting. - Go on into the parlor. Well, what did I tell you? There's the prodigal son. Would you mix us a drink, please? Cigarette? - No thanks. - Why not, your health? - Don't be so impolite Peter, you always smoke like a chimney. - Tell me Mister Von Branken, did the night you spent in the lower bunk with my future bride give you sexual pleasure? - Oh stop that Peter. Don't be so ill-mannered, the Brankens are such wonderful hosts. - I want to go now. - Well I don't. - Good for you. - Please don't go yet, here. - No, I don't feel like drinking. - The roads are pretty icy. Even the taxis have decided to call it a night. - In that case we'll walk, come on. - You mean in the freezing cold? Not on your life. I just got over the flu. - [Peter] You might dress warmer, you know. - Our attempt to act as mediators isn't working so well. In fact Walter, I think our presence is disturbing. Let me make a suggestion. You make yourselves at home in the next room, and be our guests for tonight, and tomorrow morning you'll see things more clearly. All right? Come on Peter, let's make a virtue of necessity. - No we can't stay. - But really we just got here-- - Erica please, you know I wouldn't let my worst enemy out in weather like this. Come on now, have a drink. - It's a comfortable room. - I don't know, I still think we ought to drive back home now. - Why don't you take a look at the room first? Well, how do you like it? We often have overnight guests. They all seem to enjoy it very much. - Yes but, please. - No buts, you're both staying here, all right? - Thank you and good night. - Good night, and please try and make up. - Good night Erica. - Good night. - Sleep well. - Peter? Peter? - In here. - Beautifully done darling, congratulations. Let's hope that it works out tonight. But they've got a real problem on their hands. - They say problems are best solved in bed. Please, turn the light out. The program looks promising, even more than you expected. I think your idea of a two-way mirror will pay off. - Damn it, I don't have my makeup kit with me. Not even a cleanser. Nothing. - I kept saying that we ought to go back home. - On foot? - That damn nude picture. That's what we always fight about. You always-- - Please shut up, I'm tired and I want to go to sleep. Would you please hand me one of those tissues? - Here. - Walter. Tell me what you see. - She's standing near the mirror. - And? - She's taking her makeup off. - And now? - They're still arguing. He's taking his pants off. - [Sylvia] Go on. - She's almost finished removing her makeup. She's admiring herself. She's studying her body. She's rubbing her breasts. - How are her breasts? Hard? Small? Like mine? - Bigger. Soft white skin. He's approaching her from behind. - [Sylvia] What's he doing now, Walter? - [Walter] He's pulling her panties off. - Everything, I want to know everything. Is she blonde all over? - As dark as you are. - Go on. - She doesn't want to, now he's, she's got a fantastic ass. - Nicer than that lovely redhead's? - To bed. He's kissing her breasts. (Sylvia gasping) - Go on. What's the matter, why aren't you going on? - They turned the light off. Can't see a thing now. End of the performance. What a let down. Or else we've got to get them to turn the light on somehow. Have you any ideas? (soft flute music) - I hope I'm not intruding, but I must have forgotten my nightie in the closet. - Excuse me, could you tell me where the bathroom is here? - Oh how silly of me, you have to go through there. It's on the left. Here. - Thank you. - But please don't wake my husband. - I'm sorry, excuse me. - Don't mention it. - Well, have you made up already? - No. - Well, I'll go back to bed again. Or, have you another suggestion? (flute music) - You look positively ravishing in my wife's dressing gown. - Thank you. - Did you make up finally? - Peter is so difficult. - He doesn't appear to give that impression. My wife seems to feel very much at home with him in the next room. - Oh, you don't know my Peter at all then. He'll play it so cool, he'll drive your poor wife absolutely crazy. - Would you like me to prove the contrary? - Fine. - Well it's very easy. In my bedroom, we've a ringside seat, come on. Come on, come on, sit in the front row. Make yourself comfortable. Better hold on to your seat. Not bad, huh? (romantic orchestral music) Did you enjoy that? - Yes, very much. - You could enjoy it more often. - But you're married. - Yes. - [Felix Voiceover] Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who is the fairest of them all? Erica, naturally. Now she's the queen of that perverted life that they call high society. High, my ass. She lies now in a neatly made bed, and calls herself Missus Von Branken. - Fascinating story. - Isn't it? He got rid of his former wife. She was getting a little stale for him. Erica kicked Peter out on his ear. Yes, it's decidedly a failing not to have any money. And from what I observed this evening, the marriage of Mister and Missus Von Branken is already on the rocks. - What prompted you to bring me to this party tonight? - Why are you so set on ending your days as a secretary? There are already too many. - [Astrid] Well, what would you suggest? - The usual. - Sleep with a man just to get a little-- - Oh, not any man, with the right man, yes. - [Astrid] And the man with a little money is the right man, right? - Quite wrong. A man with a lot of money. Cheers. - Did you ever hear about love? - Yes. - I asked you a question. - I don't have cotton in my ears, I heard you loud and clear. You can't imagine how rapidly a woman's passion is stirred when she gets a good whiff of money. - Cheese, sir. - It's the finest aphrodisiac that's been invented. Want to play? - What are the stakes? - Nothing but the naked truth. Be brave, sweetheart, and I'll give you the greatest lesson in life you've ever had. - Who's she? - The movie star of the year. Well done. - She doesn't impress me. However, I'd love to have her gorgeous hair. - It's just a wig, baby, as phony as the rest of her. - This isn't a dress rehearsal for Strindberg's Dance of Death, huh? It's gotta be wild, more primitive, more barbaric, understand? - So you mean like Tarzan? - If you like. And you'll have to defend yourself against him better than that. - Defend is the right word. He's about as erotic as a piece of wood. - Am I supposed to be in love with her, or not? - Take it easy, easy easy, huh? Now try it once again, will you? From the beginning? You're spending the weekend with two sisters, who have an incestuous relationship, and find all men revolting. A beautiful little bit, Myer. - Thank you Martin. The fruit of my training with Professor Butt su Castro. - Yeah, class always shows. Now, we'll start with you coming through the door, is that clear? All right, come on let's get going. Well, get a move on, come on. - Could I borrow a coat to cover myself just for the rehearsal? - Listen, do you want to be a porno film actor, or not? There, use that. Now here's what you do, you come and see the younger sister lying in bed. Now you don't want to startle her, and you cup your two hands like a funnel in front of your mouth. Now what is it, huh? Your hands in front of your mouth, so go on, do it. Like this. - Hello? (laughing) - I see nothing amusing about it, so please, no laughter. So where is our dear Miss Hansen? - She's still in makeup. - I want her here right away. In the next shot, she needs to come through that door naked. - Yes sir. - Ready? Lights, camera? - Ready. - Hold it. I think it would be better if our leading man stood for a few moments underneath a freezing shower. - I won't appear totally nude, so it's absolutely ridiculous to cover my bosoms with makeup. - Listen, try and understand darling, above the belt you're sunburned, but under. - Miss Hansen on the set please, you're wanted on the set. - All right. - Suzanne, Suzanne. Look, you don't seem to realize this role could be the chance of your life, so try to cooperate. - I don't see why I've got to take my panties off for the scene. - Because it's sensuous, my dear. - And then there's all those men staring at me all the time. - Do you want to be a movie star or don't you? - Yes, but not at any price. - Suzanne! Listen to me baby. The rules of this game are written by the public, and they want you naked. - Shit. - I've got a suggestion. Let's quit the shooting for today, and send the whole gang away, and we'll rehearse this scene together. Okay? - I'll buy that. - All right, let's go. - Suzanne sees everything more clearly, now she'll let you make her up, won't you? - Anything for you. - I'll call it quits for this afternoon, and when you're finished making her up, come on downstairs with Suzanne. We'll rehearse the scene alone. And you can do the sister's part. - It's a privilege. All right, come here I'll help you. - I can manage alone. - Have it your own way. - Why must I put makeup on if we're not really shooting the scene. - That's the way the maestro wants it, he's hypersensitive. Even rehearsal has to be realistic. He's got a lot of big plans for you. (soft jazz trumpet) - Do you know what the action is? - Yes, I think so. - And, you can do it? - I'll do my best. - Start with your entrance. And quiet on the set. - Don't be so nervous, there's nobody but us here. Here, art for the sake of art. - Do you think you'll give me a starring part in your next movie? - I'll use my influence. - Here, put this on. You'll catch a death of cold. - Coming? - [Felix] He did use his influence, from walk-ons, to bit parts, from bit parts, to the lead. Nowadays she gets $20,000 a film. - All right, I'll see you tomorrow morning, real early, huh? Nine a.m. makeup call. - You're the boss. - [Felix] I wonder how many starlets that makeup woman led into Martin's bed. Nobody'll ever know, but to my knowledge, Suzanne's the only one who made a threesome with Martin and Agnes. Oddly enough, I don't begrudge her success. When it comes down to it, she's a good kid. - [Astrid] Is she really going to marry him? - Yes. - [Astrid] You'd never think so. - Who do you mean? - The little superstar. - Oh, Suzanne. No, that girl is much too clever. Want another drink? - Yes. - Her stock hasn't been promoted on the society marriage market yet. Two or three more starring roles and she'll be up for auction. The highest bidder gets the pound of flesh. Then the papers will call it a love match. And I'll look at my pictures, and wonder what happened to my percentage. - Tell me, does every one of these bed career girls start in your photo studio? - It's only natural. Starlets, mannequins, photo models, there aren't many professions where the requisite is to lie down on a neatly made mattress. Well well, look who's coming in now. - Hello Consul. Sorry I'm a little late but I made it. - [Felix] Not such a pleasant story. The boy can't adjust to his lot in life. - What, what does he do? - He's a crown prince. In other words, the Consul's one and only heir. A tough job, all the millions will go to him once the old boy kicks the bucket, poor devil. - That girl he came in with, is that is his wife? - Yes, he deserves congratulations for landing that one. - Who is she? - No idea. Nobody seems to know where she's from, or who she is. - Hello Felix, give me a vodka, I'm thirsty. - Good evening, Astrid. - How are you Angie? - Just great. Excuse me, let me introduce my husband to you. Alex, this is Astrid. Do you know each other? - I'm sorry, I don't recall. - Here, you can use a stiff one. - But it doesn't matter, really. - Oh, excuse me, I'd better go look after him. - What's the story? - What do you want to know? - The gruesome details, apparently you know each other. - We met the way most people do, on the job. It was at a hotel. We sat out our eight-hour day, and I suppose waited for the dream man to materialize. We were sure he'd come through the revolving door and whisk us away to some castle by the sea. - Attention, Doctor Von Hoff is requested to come to the-- - Yes sir, I understand I've gotten it all down. Your assessment's ready at four o'clock, and you're expected in Zurich at the Intercontinental at five, that was all sir, yes. Cessna Intercontinental, my God, what a great life. - What are you doing this evening? - I've got an appointment with the Shah of Persia. My Cessna is all ready. - Hotel Darlines. - Good evening darling. Please connect me with room 250, Von Valstein. - I'm sorry, Miss Von Valstein isn't in the building. - Oh no? Take down my number, Angel. Tell her that I can be contacted there for the next half hour. Alexander Carst, 30, 34, and 69, like the French technique. - Just a minute please. He says 69, like the French technique. What do you think of that? - All men are bores. - Just a moment, I've just found a little note here. Miss Von Valstein says she can't make it tonight, but sends her regards. - That bitch, now what do I with the evening I have planned? Tell me, are you free tonight? - You hear that? He just asked me whether I'm free this evening. - Thank you. - My girlfriend doesn't like the idea. - Well then let her come to. - He says to bring you too. - Tell the desk, that you're a cab driver. In a half hour, we'll be off for the evening. - I've wanted to try that job for years now. - You and your crazy ideas. - Hotel Darlines. Room 150? I'll take care of it, thank you. All these wake me up calls, drive me straight up the wall. - Hotel Darlinas. (pop music) - What kind of service is this? - Looks more like a tank than a taxi. - We telephoned for a taxi, is that you? - Yes, please get in ladies. Please, get in. - Go on Angie. - That's the best seat. - Thanks. - I hope the two of you are not in a hurry. - What do you think of him, Angie? - He's a show off. I guess he's stinking rich. And he seems to think he's a lady-killer. Not in my book, and if this guy actually hopes to have an orgy with us. - Angie. - Why do you think he's asked us to go along with him tonight? So we could hold his hand? - Well, I find him rather appealing though. He hasn't tried to make a pass yet, and he hasn't said anything suggestive. And if we're sitting in his bathtub right now, it's your brilliant idea. - I was freezing. And sitting all day working that switchboard isn't the best way in the world to keep clean. - Hey it's no place like home. For one thing, the drinks you get are much better, and a lot cheaper. - You'll get a nice tip. - I can't wait. - He's an imbecile. - An imbecile? I think he's terribly cute, the way he came in with blindfolded eyes. - I think he's a moron, and that's that. (pop music) - Oh, my pajamas look quite different on you. - We're splitting now. Astrid is working tomorrow morning, and I've got to go too. - Oh, isn't that a pity? - Yes, it's been such fun. - You can call him in the afternoon, coming? - All right, another time then. I'll walk you to the elevator. After you. With these damn prehistoric elevators, you've gotta wait almost a lifetime. - I'll run on down and look for a taxi. I'll wait for you downstairs, bye. - Ciao. - Just a moment please. My girlfriend's coming too. - Okay, no hurries. Let's hope it's not gonna take much longer. I'd rather spend Christmas at home with the family. - Wait a minute, I'll have a look. - Yeah, good idea. (soft jazz music) - It's a bit uncomfortable in an elevator, isn't it? - You ain't kidding. - My gay bachelor's life was getting to be a real drag. - Why not do something about it then? - Maybe I will, even today. - I could handle the telephone for you. - And handle me, too? (gargling) (spitting) (grunting) - Never saw Angie again, I mean, not until this evening. - Catch as catch can. The best girl wins. In other words, they hoodwinked you completely. - Yes. - Yep, as for me dear, I've got to water my duck. Oh, we'll make a few more courtesy shots and then take off, okay? - Yes. - May I, Madame? Hold it. Thank you. - The audience wants to see the real thing these days. - May I, Madame? Merci. May I, Madame? Head, a little more to the right, fine fine. Thank you. May I, Madame? Not now? Having your period? (laughing) - Now listen to this, I've got an even better one. - Yes? - Now a Gentleman comes out of the ladies toilet, he went in accidentally. - A laugh a minute, our Consul Schmidts. When he's in the mood, he can entertain an entire battalion. - Entire armies my dear Sardin. - It's the individual that counts. All right, shall we go? - I'm staying a while. - Well then, good luck. - I'll start all over again. A gentleman walks into a ladies toilet accidentally. - You sure it was an accident? (laughing) - Have fun. - Thank you, I'll see you again. - What's this Sardin, you leaving already? - You won't believe this, but I want to be among people. - That's funny, very funny. (jazz music) - Felix. Felix! (upbeat jazz music) - All righty, on the job already. - Huh! (jazz music) - Hello, hi sweetheart. I'm buying tonight. - So what's the matter, Felix? You in the shit again? - Oh, right to here Susie. Vodka, chief. - Vodka? - Yeah, you might as well bring us the bottle. - There you are. Help yourself. - Vodka still your favorite drink? - It's honest. Good honest vodka. For the honest women of this world. - Oh so you've been to another one of those boring parties. - Pass it down, sweetheart. - You're in such a rotten mood. - Yeah, let's have a little swig. - It really does me good. Yep, I breathe the fresh air once more. - Didn't you pour that one-- - Cheers girls! - Cheers. - Cheers. - [Felix] Here's to ya! - What does she want here? - Aren't you out of your element, sweetheart? - Salvation Army's next door. - She's a colleague, girls. So be nice to her, will ya? - Hey Felix, what kind of competition is this? - Go hit the sidewalk, the stations, wherever you want. But don't come here and ruin the market. - She's not going to undersell you, so don't worry. She's got a nice bankroll tucked away. - Oh you don't say? - Or am I making a mistake? She's working the best-paying sidewalk in the world. She became a millionairess overnight in the liveliest and finest brothel that ever existed, the filthy gutter of marriage. She has a devoted admirer. What's more, you'd all give your eye teeth to hook such a pigeon, every last one of you. You, you, you, Maggie, even you. (laughing) - It's no use getting angry. The kid isn't worth this. Let her go back to her money mattress. - Haven't you understood yet? She's running after me. Because her old goat can't get a hard-on anymore, right? - Ah, the poor girl. - But as they say, no millionaire in the world is so impotent, that he can't crawl up to the altar. You know, Missus Michael Parrow, the Second. This isn't any place for you, sweetheart. Here, they sell only nice clean sex, nice and pure, instead of your cracked wedding balls, I mean bells. - [Woman] Now you're hitting below the belt, Felix. - Beautiful brassiere, huh? Look at these golden tights. How much am I bid for this beauty? - Go get your union card punched. (laughing) - She doesn't have to get it punched, because it gets punched when he gets it up, about once a month. Marital obligations, even a millionaire deserves a little gratitude. Vodka. I want vodka, damn it. - [Woman] Felix, you've got a whole bottle. - [Felix] I've got a whole, ah so I do. (laughing) - I won, I won. - If I may be permitted to say something sir? If the Consul loses the game, once again, I will gladly take his place. - Wait a minute there, it's 50-50. (laughing) - Hah, I won that one. - Where's my glass? Oh, look at that, it's much too dry. - Let's go where it's wet, then. (soft piano music) (Astrid laughing) - All right, all right, come here now James, make it snappy. - [Astrid] He's so funny. - Well one does what one can. - Come here, come here Astrid, please, now you can't spend the whole winter in the water. - [Astrid] I can't go out. I can't go out. My panties got lost in the water somewhere. - Or else, James? - Yes sir? - What does a butler in a well-run household do when in such circumstances? - Why, he helps the lady put on her panties. - Bravo. Now you'll find the panties on the floor of the swimming pool. There they are, right there. (laughing) - Consul, I feel naked without my toupe. - James, go down and do your duty. - You're an extremely restless lady if I may say so. - I'm afraid James lacks a certain experience. James, now bring the lady to the home to dry off. Go on, hurry up. - This is easier said than done, sir. Please don't wiggle, Madame. - [Consul] Go on, James. (jazz flute music) - What do you want? I need you like a hole in the head. Photo tests are tomorrow morning at 11. Today is a day of rest. - I tried, really I did. - What? - Well I did everything I could to make a play for the Consul. - What happened? - Well first-- - Yes yes, I know, the swimming pool. The Consul is overwhelmingly original. And you lost your panties? And the swimming pool, was it heated at least? - Yes, but how did you know? - You must be the 12th female to fall for that number. And then in the sauna, the butler raced in, on you and the old swine and bounced all over you. The word sauna must come from sow. - I managed to break loose. - Even outside my front door, you can get on my nerves. I'm tired, I want to hit the sack. Alone. - [Driver] What's it gonna cost, sweetheart? - 50 bucks. - [Driver] Okay, get in. - That's the end of that circus. The orgy's over pal, shove off. - [Driver] Okay, okay. (crying) - That was from papa, to knock some sense into you. Forget everything I told you. It doesn't apply to you. You'll be happy even as a secretary. And you know something? It's really wonderful knowing that there are still girls like you. Have a good trip. (soft jazz music)
