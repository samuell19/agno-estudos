NEPENTHE FILM PRESENTS After fleeing from Prince Drakan – – Dina Tonerre, the Shamer's daughter, hides among the clans in the Highlands – – along with her family and the rightful heir Prince Nicodemus Ravens. Drakan has invaded the Lowlands, and it is feared – – that he will invade the Highlands. The clans will not submit to the Order of the Dragon – – but as long as Nicodemus doesn't rise up against Drakan – – the future looks bleak. Standing between peace and an impending war are only the Shamers. As long as you're half, you can't be whole. You have to enter the darkness to find light. In the darkness you'll meet truth – – and only thereafter will you be whole. Hurry, Dina! Hurry before it's too late. Bad dream? Did you have that dream again? It was just a dream. Dina... THE SHAMER'S DAUGHTER II THE SERPENT GIFT What are they doing here? The harvest market is a neutral place. Even Drakan's soldiers are welcome. Let's go. – Mom? – Hi. Good to see you. Dina, help your brother while we go to the clan meeting. – There you are. – Thank you. – What? – They ask for you, Mesire. Shouldn't you be at the clan meeting? Shouldn't you be selling herbs? I envy ordinary people. People have told me how to behave all my life. I thought that was over, since no one knows me here. The clans want me to unite them against Drakan. They want me to be ... a hero. Is that so terrible? You don't understand. It's just ... Look at me, Nico. Nico. Bian ... I'm sorry. How can I protect the Highlanders when I couldn't protect my brother? Another sheep has been stolen. The prisoner was caught red–handed by the Skaya clan. He was dressed in Kensie clan colors. – He isn't one of us. – Say you, Kensie pigs! Silence! Silence! Let's find out what happened. Melussina. Look at me. He's an outlawed lowlander who was duped into sowing discord among us. He was given Kensie clothes by a stranger who paid him to steal sheep. Dear clan members, this is another of Drakan's attempts to break our alliance. But thanks to Melussina's gift we know the truth. These are troubled times. I understand, but now is the time to stand united. – Where is Prince Nicodemus? – Probably too drunk to piss standing. Silence! Show some respect! The young prince is the only one who can unite the Lowlands and Highlands. Without him we don't stand a chance against Prince Drakan. Dina. Dina. Come. I've been searching for you for so long. Dina! Come with me. Now! – Medama. – We have to go now. He found us. Have the clans started fighting each other? In the spring, we poisoned their wells and stole livestock to create discord. But they resolve everything without violence. It doesn't sound like them. I'll go to Sagisborg at once. Bring the Highland prisoners to help with the entrenchment. When the castle is prepared for winter, we attack. When is the army ready to march to the Highlands? Mesire, we have to get the clans to fight amongst themselves. – Otherwise we risk ... – Otherwise what? Medama. If we can't get the clans to fight amongst themselves – – they will unite against us when we enter the Highlands. It's the work of the Shamer witches. As long as they're alive, the clans won't turn against each other. Transport the prisoners to the castle. The Shamer's daughter is at the harvest market. Then so is her mother. Sarkan? Find the witches. You'll get four more vials of dragon blood when you bring us their heads. The convict ship sails towards Sagisborg prison. Drakan's only outpost in the free Highlands. But the legend says a sacrifice must be made for safe passage – – or the wyrm will attack the vessel. – Out you go. – Oh no! I can't swim. A sea serpent. Oh no! Help! Ow! I can't feel my legs. Mommy! How come people don't like me? Don't you worry about that, my beautiful boy. But, mommy, nobody wants to play with me. – I'm all alone. – Alone?! Nonsens. You're not alone. – You have me. – You're my favorite in the whole world. Drakan is a mommy's boy! Who said that? Move! Grab her. You're under arrest in the name of the Prince. Let her go. Grab Melli and run! – Who was that man in the woods? – Where are the others? – Answer me, Mom. – Just know you're in great danger. We have to leave now. – Is he a Shamer? – Absolutely not. – Are you just going to stand there? – It's as if he ... He is a Black Master. The opposite of us. We show people the truth, but he shows them lies to serve his purposes. – He knows my name. – Enough! Melussina. The Dragon soldiers came to the puppet show. Where is Davin? Wait! The market is neutral. You jeopardize the peace if you take prisoners. I'll happily exchange my prisoners ... ... for these two Shamer witches. Get lost, or we'll bring you as wyrm food. – For the sake of peace. – Man the oars! Yes, Captain. Cast off! – You needn't come with me. – You're needed here. I'll go alone. I have to be at Sagisborg to oversee preparations. I'll do that. I'm the prince. And the castle must be ready for the army's arrival. We'll do what we planned. We'll burn the villages and kill the livestock. Then we'll entrench ourselves at Sagisborg – – and wait for the cold and hunger to break the Highlands. It's a good strategy. No one knows Sagisborg like I do. I grew up there in the cold and stench from the lake. You stay here and get the army ready to march. They need your steady hand. Once Sarkan has killed the witches, the clans will kill each other. The Highlands will be vulnerable. When winter is over, the people will welcome you like a savior. There's only one thing man loves more than his freedom. And that's order. Sezuan. How did you find us? The rumor that you're helping the clans has spread quickly. All the Highlanders know you're here. Stop following us. Leave Dina and me alone! She doesn't have the Serpent Gift. No one has both gifts. Believe what you want. I'm here to get to know her. – I've waited 15 years for this. – Don't pretend that's why you're here. You would've taken her from me if you had the chance. You're making a huge mistake. Only Dina can save her brother. He's going to Sagisborg. Only I can show her how to get in there. – Her Shamer's gift can't get her in. – She doesn't have your gifts, Sezuan. Leave her alone. I'm your father, Dina. If you want my help to free your brother – – meet me at North Mountain. We can do this together. Come. Steer clear of him, Dina. He's dangerous. – Is he Davin's father too? – Just yours. They refused to negotiate. There's a reward on your heads – – so we have to leave now. – Mom... – Oh no. – We can ask for his help. – No. You can't trust a word he says. He's from a long line of liars and traitors. He wants to teach you his black magic, but it's dangerous and treacherous. Whatever happens, promise me you'll never use it. Promise me, Dina. Promise me! I promise. Medama, we have to go. Come, Dina. Welcome to Sagisborg. You're here to work. If you're difficult – – or look at us the wrong way – – you'll get the whip. – Isn't that so, Petrus? – Yes, Captain. If you keep being difficult, you'll go to the Hall of Whisperers. That'll teach you to behave. Isn't that so, Mattias? You two will work in the smithy. You four in the laundry with Mattias. You two in the kitchen ... If you try to escape, you'll be wyrm food. – Petrus, show them their new home. – Yes, Captain. If you want my help to free your brother – – meet me at North Mountain. No, Dina! It's too dangerous. Don't go. – I'll go with you. – No. Take care of Mom and Melli. Davin and Nico need my help. Sweet Bliss ... Go on. Run back to the others. Sezuan? Sezuan? Did you break something? I think so. I doubt it. Get up. – Why did you remove the rope? – I thought you weren't coming. – Can you really get into Sagisborg? – I can teach you how to get in. I'm not learning black magic. Just show me the way, so I can free Davin and Nico. – Nico? – Nicodemus Ravens. Does your mother know you're here? Are you going to help me or not? What's in it for me? You get time with me. – Fair enough. – Good. Let's get going. Coming? It's this way. The ones who are too sick to work are put here. – They'll never get well down here. – Then they're thrown to the wyrm. Drakan is preparing for war. – We're going down here. – Watch out! Are you hurt? Help! – Throw him in the lake. – He broke his leg. – Up against the wall! – No. Come on. Get up. Now! Wait. You're a tough guy. – Whip his friend instead. – No. – Have we met before? – No. I would have remembered that. How long will it take? – Two days on foot. – Wouldn't it be quicker by boat? Yes, it looks peaceful. But the wyrm lives in the waters around Sagisborg. The wyrm is a myth. Tell that to the sea maiden who lived there – – before he moved in. We'll camp here. Gather some branches to sleep on. Damn it! All those damned nettles! How many do we need? About 30 or 40. Two days of traveling with that jerk! That's plenty. Good. Just put them over there. Give me a hand. There. You can sleep over there. Wake up. We have to get out of here. – Get up! – Leave me alone. We have to get out of here! How? Huh? Wake me when you have a plan. The great Nicodemus, the drunken bum. He'll play the hero if his friends take beatings for him. I thought you hid with my family to avoid fighting Drakan. But I was wrong. You're not a coward. You're just a spoilt prince who won't fight for anything. – Isn't that true? – What's wrong with you? Who is that? Dama Lizea. Drakan's mother. It's just a matter of time before they find out who you are. Wake me up when you have a plan. Dina. He's a Black Master. The opposite of us. We show people the truth, but he shows them lies to serve his purposes. Follow me. Can you hear me? Wake up. Good morning. Why did you do that? Now I'll catch cold and get sick. Walking will warm you up. Shall we? Come along. – Why does Mom hate you? – Does she? – She says you abandoned us. – I'll bet. – Did you? – No. Stop. Look at me. Look at me. – Do you think I'm lying? – Yes. – I never lie. – Then why does Mom hate you? It's a long story. Prince Drakan? – We received a message from Sarkan. – What was it? He's close to finding the Shamer's daughter in the forest. – Fill the bottles to the brim. – But, Mesire ... Then she'll die. Nicodemus Ravens. Don't you recognize me? No. You were just a kid when I last saw you. Your father gave me this. For dedicated service. The Order of the Raven. Your father was a great man. I know what they did back then. Your family doesn't deserve this. The cabinet. What? The cabinet. The cabinet. Davin. Davin! What? Come and see. We need files. Yes. Come on. – Would you like to try? – I promised Mom I wouldn't do it. Dina. Are you embarrassed that you're ... Your daughter? That you grew up without a father? This stone was given to me by an old magician. It's an invisibility stone. Watch. Isn't that black magic? I never lie. Here. Take the stone. Imagine your core as immovable as stone. Then imagine yourself dissipating like smoke in the wind. Yes. It's no good. Maybe I should teach you to play a melody instead. Didn't you hear me? I won't learn your stupid black magic! Nico. Have them sharpened! – What is it? – He looks like my brother. Get moving. Davin! Davin. Davin! – What? – You're making too much noise. – Then think of something. – Like what? What do I know? Sing a song. Drink ... drink ... Drink up. Drink your wine and drink your mead. Drain your tankard for soon you will be dead. Even though I'm dead, I will come back, come back. And drink all your liquor. Drink your wine and drink your mead. Drain your tankard for soon you will be dead. Even though I'm dead, I will come back, come back. And drink all your liquor. Hey, drink. ... drink all your liquor. That looks nice. Hello! – Hello. – Be quiet. Go away. Are you hard of hearing, you devil? Mesire, gracious master. Can I offer you a meal? – It smells good. Come. – I'm not hungry. – Let's keep going. – Come, Dina. We have to eat. We only have stew from yesterday. If you like, I'll skin the rabbit. – We want rabbit, don't we? – No. – Stew is fine. – Wine? Please. Thank you. Cheers, Dina. How do you do it? Look at me. I told you I don't want to learn black magic. Calm down, Dina. I'm only going to show you. Just look at me. Shamers have the power to force people to see the truth – – while the Serpent's Gift seduces the human mind. Sometimes to trick or to dazzle – – but usually just to slightly change their perception of reality. Dina? But you're lying to him. It's reality for him. How is the stew? Why didn't you try to find me until now? I've tried to find you your whole life. Is that your reality – – or is it true? Let's dance. Music! May I have this dance? Come on, Dina. Let's dance. May I have this dance? Stop it, both of you. Dina, look after this little guy. Here we go! Petrus. Come. We're escaping. I need to ... I need to rest for a minute. – Is this alright? – Yes. – What do we do? – Swim across it. – We can't. – We have to try. – He has to rest first. – He can't make it. – Then we'll help him. – No. – We'll never make it with him, Nico. – We're not leaving Petrus behind. This was a bad idea. Let's go before they find out. It's only a matter of time before Dama Lizea discovers you. Then you're dead. – Do you think this is only about you? – Me? Nico. Davin is right. Get as far away as you can. Soon the army will enter the Highlands. They'll burn down villages and kill livestock. – And entrench themselves here. – Then the clans will attack. But the castle is unconquerable. Drakan has hoarded food for the entire winter. He just has to wait for the resistance – – to succumb to the cold, frost... ... and hunger. If we destroy his food stores – – he can't entrench himself here. – Davin. – No. Come on. Come on. Alright then. Last night, Petrus tried to escape. He must have planned it for years. And you must have known and not warned us. Usually that means a trip in the Hall of Whisperers, but we'll forget that. From now on – – all of you will be punished – – for your comrades' mistakes. It's up to you how we should treat you. – Is that understood? – Yes, Captain. Dina... We have to go. Use the flute. Make yourself invisible. – I can't. – Try. Use your core like the immobility of the mountain. – And dissipate ... – Like smoke in the wind. Be quiet! It's the Shamer witch. Why didn't you do that from the get–go? We can take their horses. We can ride. Dina, we're walking. – Can't Sezuan the Black Master ride? – Of course I can. Let's go then. Come on. Use your core. It's no wonder that it took you 15 years to find me – – if you walked the whole way. Does that mean I'm a serpent child? Mom says I don't have the gift. There's no way she could know. – Why only use the flute sometimes? – It depends on the situation. It's one of many tools, but it's the same power. Sometimes it's easier to redeem the inner force through something outer. Dina, you Shamer ability isn't enough – – if you want to save your brother and Nicodemus. Don't you just use the gift to trick people? – I use it to help. – Yourself. And you. Nothing is purely good or evil. Water gives life. But the sea drowns sailors. I made a promise to Mom. Give me the girl, Black Master, and I'll let you live. Dina, run away. Sarkan! Let her go. – I'll tell you where Nicodemus is. – No. – You're lying. – At Sagisborg. As a prisoner. – No one knows it's him. – He's lying! He's lying! He's lying. Let's go. Dina. Dina, stop! Now they know where Nico and Davin are! Sarkan is a ruthless murderer. I could've lost you. – I don't care! – I did it for our sake. I don't need you. Dama Lizea, we've had word from Sarkan. Nicodemus Ravens is here at Sagisborg. Nicodemus! He's hiding among the prisoners. You can't enter Sagisborg without using the gifts. I made a promise to Mom. And I don't have your gift. You have to give it a go. It's black magic. And this is just an ordinary stone. There is no magician. Why does Mom hate you? I'm from an ancient line of Black Masters. Like the Shamer power, the Serpent Gift is in the blood. My mother was a woman you couldn't refuse. She wanted to create a hybrid of a Shamer and a Black Master. A person who had both gifts. She sent me to seduce your mother. Inside I was cold, but Melussina ignited something in me. Something I thought had been dead for ages. My mother demanded that I steal you, but I refused. She sent Black Masters to get you. When Melussina discovered who my family and I were – – she left me and took you with her. But I didn't lie to her. My love for your mother was genuine. Nicodemus Ravens. Nicodemus, show yourself. Show yourself, Nicodemus. No one else should suffer because of me. Nico, for goodness sake! Don't. Stop it. I am Nicodemus Ravens. I'll be damned. Welcome to the Hall of Whisperers. The place that breaks even the strongest men. No! No! Davin! Be strong! Yes, this is Nicodemus. King slayer! What will people think? If one king's head rolls, another will soon follow. What has happened to our Nicodemus? He's become brave and sober. Life as a slave has done him good. No, no, no. We can't let our emotions get the better of us. Let's not get rid of something useful. Throw him into the Hall of Whisperers. He'll do anything to get out again. Even swear fidelity to Drakan. It will crush the people's hope for a new ruler. Never! I'll never swear fidelity to the Order of the Dragon. Never! It was Drakan who stabbed your father – – and tiny, little Bian. But I was the one who made him to do it. What a fine boat you have. Is it for sale? The time has come for you to learn to use the Serpent Gift. Even if we make it past the wyrm – – there will be many obstacles before you get to your brother and Nicodemus. You must use your power. The gift isn't just a weapon. If you use it on people of pure heart, you can give them dreams. You can show them their deepest desire. Give the fisherman a dream. Let him meet those he misses the most. Let the power speak through you. Mother. Go... Let's get out of here before he comes to. Davin? Davin! Put him in the cellar. If he isn't human by sunrise, give him to the wyrm. No! Nico! Black Master! Give me the witch! I swear by the gods! Give her to me! Black Master! Give me the witch and I'll let you live! Dad. Sarkan stabbed me. – I can't. – Dad... Dad! Dad. Dad, the flute. Dad? Coward. Bian. Dina? Coward. Nico. Bian. Nico... Hi. Bian? He's getting closer. Bian? Hi. Where were you? You were supposed to protect me. They killed me. I'm sorry, Bian. I'm sorry. – I'm sorry. – It hurt a lot. I'm sorry. I'll protect you. I will protect you. I will protect you. I forgive you. Dad. Dad... I want you to know something. I have gotten the only thing – – that I ever wished for. A daughter with a heart... ... of pure gold. Dad. Dad? Dad? Dad? Dad. Use your core like the immobility of the mountain. Davin? Davin? Davin? Nico! Dina? Nico! – Dina! How did you get in here? – I got some help. – Where is Davin? – In the dungeon. – He's not there. – We'll find him. Come. Let's go! Dina? – Davin must be in one of the cells. – Let's free everyone. The only way out must be through the courtyard. Come out, everyone! Out. Come on. Out! Davin? Davin? Medama. The intruders have destroyed our food stores and freed the prisoners. – You stay and protect Medama. – Put archers above the courtyard. When the intruders come out, kill them. – Understood. You stay here. – No. I want to be alone. Out! Nicodemus. – Grab some weapons. – Where are the other prisoners? – In the cellar. – Come on, Dina. Go! This way. Shamer witch! No! Throw it. Let's go. There she is. Be afraid. Come here. Let's see your beginning, your shame. I see you. Are you what I have become? Lizea, the child has to be removed! You were to wait until Prince Ravens married you. It's a boy. I can feel it. The Prince will have to admit responsibility for it. No, he won't. You won't give birth to a prince's son. You will give birth to a bastard, you whore! You let your son grow inside you though he was doomed to a life of mockery. Drakan... Drakan... My son. Your son. Hurry! Come on! Come on! Get them. Get the battering ram! The rest will come with me. Come on. My name is Nicodemus Ravens. He's the prince. You've probably heard that I'm a coward and a drunk. And it's true. I've always felt a responsibility I can't bear. I thought it was my duty to defeat Drakan and Dama Lizea alone. But I can't. I need your help. Make room for the battering ram. Behind that door are Drakan's soldiers. They'll take our freedom. We can't let them get in. Go on! Put your backs into it! If you help me barricade it, we can get to the boat and escape. As free people. As free people. Are you with me? – Are you with me? – Yes! Are you with me? Grab something heavy. Davin? Davin. Davin. Davin. Davin. Hey. Davin, we're going home. We're going home. Davin. We're going home. Dina... I want to go home. Take them. You two switch. Davin. – Can you walk? – Yes. Good. Take this. Davin, come with me. Lift them up. Forward! Fire! Forward! Davin! Sagisborg is burning! Dama Lizea was found in the Hall of Whisperers. She is in a very bad way. Medama, can you hear me? Medama! Out. Out! Out! Out! Oars up! As long as you're half, you aren't complete. Once in a while you have to move through darkness to find the light. In the light there is truth – – and in the encounter with truth, you can become complete. In silence there's only death. The worries that burden you – – is just life's way of calling you to an adventure. Whatever others say about you – – and however you feel yourself, cowardly – – or brave – – Shamer or Black Master ... Dina, you'll always be my daughter.
