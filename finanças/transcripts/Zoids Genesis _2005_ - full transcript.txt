They should know that such a weak attack would fail. Retreat. Assault What a surprise. Even though you were caught in a suicide bombing by a large scale Zoid you only got a few scratches. That is Volcano's power. Just wait, Ruuji-kun. I'll show you that luck isn't everything. You're pretty good. Damn it! Damn it, just a bit more...! When will Murasame Liger return to Zuuri?! Do not be impatient. I hate him! They're not here yet? They sent the signal long ago. They're probably checking to make sure the enemies aren't around them. Zuuri's entrance must never be known. They come. Where?! Where?! Princess! Princess! She can't hear. Let the army headquarters know. We have found the entrance to Zuuri. There are more Zoids, aren't there? You did good work while I was gone. I was not careless. No matter how many times Digald attacked, Zuuri held! I know everyone must be tired, but there is information that must be told. Good. I will gather everyone. Sorry for being late! Gaball-san! I was waiting for you to return. I'm putting my life into the Digald Suppression Army's hands. Pleased to work with you, Ruuji. Okay! Glad to work with you. So you're Ruuji? As Garaga said, you seem like quite the man. I'm glad I came. So I'm going... Everyone's waiting. Why were you so slow? Sorry. Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please. Gentleman. We have found the path into Zuuri. As planned, my fifth division will make a frontal attack. We will commence the Zuuri penetration operation! Furthermore, the division will meet up with Colonel Felme's troops. How can this be?! They are creating the BioZoids themselves? What fearsome technology! If we don't put a stop to their advancement soon... Yeah. But now that they have Konmesu and the western bank... Digald's conquered lands are growing more and more. Koppi village's Kanpio. Jupabuzan's Sanzu. Doezutoge's Gontrega. Many guerrillas have started up, but... But they don't respond to us. Everyone is waiting to see if our army is good or not. It can't be helped that they need to proceed cautiously. The fact is that we've lost once before. They're worried about fighting with us who have lost once before. But we can't just keep pulling back! The deeds of Murasame Liger's in the River of Fog are already spreading in every area as a legend. Everywhere I go I also hear that. They talk about Murasame Liger like it's the savior. It gives people all around the strength to rebel against Digald. Ruuji grants the light of hope to those who desire to defy Digald. I... don't really... So winning is all about giving your soldiers confidence? My treasure. This will make you feel better. As long as Digald Bukoku's invasion remains unstopped... no one can smile as they live in the world. We need the power of more people! But... One and only life... Many lives... They must be cherished. Okay. Come to the kitchen later. How are you feeling? I think I'm going to have a long life. Do you believe that? Yeah. How long must we wait for Kida-han's resurrection? My Lord. My Lord. Try it. What is this? I made it. Mii, I thought you can only make barbecue? Just eat it already! Okay. It's good. It's good, Mii. Eat that and feel better. Okay! We're attacking Zuuri like this? Right. Since we don't know what the structure is like inside currently... You won't know till you attack, right? In a cooperative operation we have to be of the same mind, right? Damn Murasame Liger! I'll definitely find and destroy him! What'll you do if you're surrounded by the enemy's army? I'll leave the small fish. That's why your troops are around. Colonel. Even if he is a child, he must learn the disciplines of an army. No need. This child is special. Gazel-kun. Have all hidden gunners pull back. Change in plans! Diga! All hidden gunners are to immediately retreat! Diga! - We are to withdraw! - Okay! Notification to each unit. Change in plans, we are going through with a bombardment! An enemy attack?! A Digald attack. So what? It's no big deal. What's this? Report! Digald have penetrated the waterfall area! What?! Why didn't we notice the enemy nearing?! Who is the enemy commander? It's probably Trofle's fifth division Major Boora. What?! They set up ambush troops. It probably happened in the afternoon attack. I'm a fool. Take care here! Yes, sir! Hurry! Hurry! Let's get going! Ruuji! Hurry! I'm going on ahead! Have a good trip. Where is Murasame Liger?! Come out! Ruuji-kun! Go up from below! Up! Up! You bugs are annoying! Stop it! Oh! Ruuji-dono. There you are. Take this! I knew it. Hayate's katanas can't reach him! It's no good with Murasame's large katana! If only I had two large katanas... I'd be able to stop those two giant horns! It's no use! Ruuji-dono! Ruuji grants the light of hope to those who desire to defy Digald. Everyone needs me... Feels like I'm going to fry. You're not getting one step further! I can't afford to lose! I need to give everyone courage! I cannot afford to lose! Mugen... Hayate Mugen Go! Mugen Liger! Souta! Don't get in the way, Felme! Ron! We did it! The invading army has been pushed back. The operation was a failure it seems. All troops pull back. They're retreating, but... I cannot be forgiven for letting Digald penetrate our base. kodomo no koro kara yume miteta honto no negai wo hanashitai otona ni naru tabi fukuranda himitsu no negai mo sukoshi dake motto massugu ni hitamuki ni gimme gimme gimme kimi dake ni yume wo uchi aketai ari no mama de lovin'u kimi ni itsumo marugoto kono kokoro agetai yo arittake no any time kimi no soba ni bokura ga ima mezasu ano basho de I've had his dream since I was a child I want to tell you what I'm really wishing for When you become an adult, you grow bigger Slowly I will tell you my secret desire More straight forward!
