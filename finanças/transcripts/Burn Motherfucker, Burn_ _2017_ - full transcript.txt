You know, I--Sacha, I do know a little bit about it. LA, actually all of the West Coast, is really bad about keeping its history, so you know, some of it is-- some of it's a little bit lost. We're an organization with about 145 years of history. You know, this was a small pueblo, Los Angeles, built on a river not very far from where we sit right now. Originally it was a very Western town. ♪ exciting music ♪ [Mike] It had a very violent beginning. [gunshot] Homicide rates in early Los Angeles were much higher than they ever have been since, and so it was from the start a very violent place. I'm still terrified by the LAPD. The institution itself is a fundamentally evil institution that is only in this day partially reformed. It was rebuilt explicitly after the Second World War to enforce racial restrictions. ♪ upbeat music ♪ [Arthur] When I was 17 years old, the Los Angeles Police Department changed my life. [man] This man is the symbol of the finest police officer in the world. [Arthur] It was at a Halloween dance, and a fight broke out. LAPD came, and I guess I wasn't moving fast enough or whatever, but the guy hit me with the billy club. [man] Remember, as police officers, we may only use that amount of force necessary to make an arrest. I was beat by maybe nine police, worse than Rodney King. I must have stayed in the hospital for maybe a couple of months before I even went to court. They didn't want any judge to see the condition that I was in. When I got out of juvenile hall, I was saying "Yes, sir. No, ma'am. Thank you." My--my family didn't recognize me, you know? It changed me. I was wrong, so I got what I deserved. [man] But you think you deserved to get beat worse than Rodney King for moving a little bit slow? Well...no, I don't, but I was resisting. [Malcolm X] Let us remember that we are not brutalized because we're Baptists. We're not brutalized because we're Methodists. We're not brutalized because we're Muslims. We're not brutalized because we're Catholics. We're brutalized because we are black people in America. [cheers and applause] [news anchor] In the spring of 1962, a gun battle between Negroes and police outside the Los Angeles Mosque of the Muslims, a sect built around the belief that complete separation of the races is the only hope for America. In that gunfight, one Negro was killed, 14 wounded. [Mike] In the early '60s, friends of Malcolm X set up a mosque in Los Angeles. One of the leading members of the mosque worked in a laundry, so he would bring clothes in the trunk of his car. He was parked about a block away from the mosque, and he was getting out, and somebody came over to help him, and the LAPD stopped them, harassed them, and then began to knock them around. More cops came. The cops invaded the mosque itself, and one cop was shot by another cop accidentally. The cops went mad. They lined Muslims up, and they shot them in the genitals, and people were killed, including one of the acquaintances of Malcolm X. Malcolm X wanted to retaliate and take out cops. Elijah Muhammad thought that the nation would lose everything if it did that. Seventy-five police came over to kill all that they could of my--of my followers in Mosque Number 27. Think over that. [news anchor] Some Los Angeles citizens believe the Muslim shootings so crystallized Negro feelings that from that point, April 1962, big trouble was inevitable. [Malcolm X] Two of the brothers were shot in the back. Two of them were shot-- excuse the expression-- through the penis. [crowd murmuring] And I, for one, as a Muslim, believe that the white man is intelligent enough. If he were made to realize how black people really feel and how fed up we are, without that old compromising sweet talk-- stop sweet-talking him. Tell him how you feel, and let him know that if he's not ready to clean his house up... If he's not ready to clean his house up, he shouldn't have a house. It should catch on fire and burn down. [cheers and applause] All right, panel, a brilliant beginning. Now let's see what you can do with our second challenger. Will you sign in, please, sir? Bill... Bill Parker, is that right, sir? [applause] [news anchor] One man who has played an important role in raising the Los Angeles police officers to a professional status is Police Chief William Parker. He has been able to create divisions within the department to deter the Los Angeles rising crime rate. [Alex] William Parker, who was the law and order chief of the LAPD, was probably one of the most racist police chiefs that the LAPD has ever had. [Connie] If you go way back to the beginning of LAPD, it started out with that Southern, racist mentality. "We're here to keep the niggers in place." Parker-- he imposed a military culture. [man] The Los Angeles Police Department, through years of self-evaluation and constant improvement, has raised itself to a high professional standing in the community. [Connie] But in militarizing them, they didn't get rid of the racism, and so the racism took on an occupying force quality. The white deputy chief who got assigned to Watts-- his unofficial title was "Nigger Inspector." [Alex] He recruited officers that were from the South. He recruited officers that he knew hated black people. [dog barking] And he didn't care about policing the black community in a way to make everyone safe. He just wanted to police the community to keep them there, and to keep the whites over here safe. Los Angeles is the finest place in the world for the Negro, because he has the greatest opportunity here, on a broad basis, than he would anywhere else in the world. ♪♪ [man] Los Angeles had a reputation, at one point, of being a good city for black culture. For instance, late 1940s, Central Avenue, the center of black culture and a totally integrated scene. Central Avenue was the drag for us. I mean, that's where you had all the entertainment. That's where all the entertainers came and they lived, 'cause they couldn't live anywhere else. You're talking about Billie Holiday. You're talking about Nat King Cole. You're talking about Sammy Davis Jr. When Parker became chief of police, he launched a campaign. He would arrest white women going to clubs on Central Avenue for prostitution. When I was a young teenager, the center of the world was a place called Dolphins of Hollywood, greatest record store in the world. Everybody came there. Parker actually laid siege to it. He had cops stationed outside to turn people away if they were white. ♪ upbeat drum rhythm ♪ [Perry] Compton was all white. Southgate was all white.

[Jeff] When the highway system gets built up during the 1950s and the 1960s, they're meant to be able to allow people to get into the downtown and out of the downtown area. The suburbs are increasingly built up all along these different arteries. White flight basically begins during the 1940s, and what that means is that who's left in the inner cities are basically people of color. ♪ upbeat music ♪ ♪♪ [news anchor] Watts is a ghetto but not a slum, as the term is known in older cities. There are streets of trim, lower-middle-class homes, and there are squalid areas of condemned houses with people living in them. Two thirds of the adults have less than a high school education. One in eight is illiterate. Watts has the lowest average income rate in Los Angeles County: $4,000 per year compared with more than $8,000 per year for the white community. They crowd together, these backcountry refugees, a thousand new ones every month pouring into Los Angeles. And they find in the land of golden promise that there still are white lawmen, white merchants, white landlords. [Jeff] Watts in the mid-'60s is fully overcrowded, and what you see is Los Angeles police literally trying to figure out ways to contain black folks and people of color in their neighborhoods. There was this ideal that African Americans can migrate to LA and escape the racism from the South, but what-- what they didn't realize was that whites were immigrating to Los Angeles from those same cities, from those same communities. They wanted to keep black folks in our place. We couldn't go off of this boundary and this boundary, and the police were basically used to keep us under control. Gangs were formed, in a sense, to protect us, you know, from those who would come in and prey on the community like the Spook Hunters, you know, which was a group of white boys out of Compton. You know, they used to come down and prey on folks in the neighborhood. The Spook Hunters is the one that's the most infamous one, because they had that leather jacket with the African-American on the back of the jacket with a noose around his neck, which seems pretty crazy, but that's what a lot of the guys from the 1950s tell us. They would catch us by ourself and jump out and rat-pack us. So that was the start of the Slauson, the Businessman, Rebel Rousers, the Gladiators. It was protection for our black people. ♪♪ [Dee Dee] One day, I was driving down the street, and I saw they had these six young African-American men, you know, maybe 16 to 18. They had 'em just standing on the sidewalk. "Hands on your head," you know, "Put your hands on your head." Sometimes they make 'em put their hands on the hot car or "Lay down," lay down on the ground. "Lay on your belly," you know, that racist behavior. So I pulled over, and I get out of my car. I see this happening, and the police said to me, "Who are you? Are you their mother?" I said, "Yes." And so the kids looked at me, you know, and they--they were like, "Why did you get out your car?" You know, "Are you related to them?" I said, "I'm the mother of a nation and a universe." You know, I'm all of their mothers, and he said, "Shuffle your feet and move on, or you're going to jail for loitering." When I was with the Los Angeles Police Department, I worked in South-Central LA. I-I knew a lot of the people who lived there, and they--they depended on the Los Angeles Police Department to have any kind of decent quality of life. [Danny] It was a horrible time. You didn't see lynchings of the sort that we were sort of familiar with and outraged about in the South, but it was the same thing, as it was a dead black man, or it was a violated black woman. You weren't on the plantation, but you were-- you know, you were in your car. I mean, I can remember a time when they pulled me and my wife and my son over, and just treated us awfully. The question is, how many slaps in the face can a community take? The complaint that you hear everywhere is that the Negro is not getting the same treatment from the police as the white, and-- Well, I think that--I know, but I'm getting a little bit weary of that, and I think perhaps the best thing to do is just to pull the police out of the area. I've offered to do that again and again, but you see how quickly all-- they come back and say, "We can't afford to have that," because you must remember-- and-and this is the thing you must think of when you get this vicious canard-- is that the great majority of the victims of Negro crime are Negroes.

She was raving, saying really at Marquette, "I told you," you know, "Don't be drinking" and this-- but her whole thing was for the officer not to impound that 1955 Buick, and the officer-- he was gonna let Marquette go. Then these other two racist police pulled up. And the LAPD does their usual humiliating, aggressive behavior. Marquette's mother jumped on the back of the officer. They got to going at it. They finally got Marquette, Ronald, and Rena in the police car and drove off, but the highway patrol was still here waiting on the tow truck to tow the 1955 Buick. A sister by the name of Joyce Gaines did hair, and she had on a smock that made her look like she was pregnant. We were exchanging words and telling him, "Don't impound the car, man."

That is to pull everybody together and get them into some constructive program. [man] The Black Panthers come onto the scene very shortly thereafter. [Bobby] The racist dog policemen must stop their wanton murder and brutality of black people or face the wrath of armed black people in the black community. The US and the Panthers had different ideologies. The US Organization were more cultural nationalists. They wore dashikis, grew their hair out, and the Panthers were revolutionaries. They wore leather jackets. They talked about being armed and using weapons in self-defense. But they were all motivated by monitoring the LAPD. Let's monitor what they do, taking down names of cops, documenting police abuses. A lot of the gang members became Panthers. They were repurposed community activists. They had something different to do. They had something that was positive to do. [Alex] And it was a really good time, because crime was down. Gang violence was at its lowest, and consciousness was at its highest for African-Americans. It wasn't sanctioned by the system, by white folk, by law enforcement, so it was a constant, you know, ebb and flow, if you will, on attempt to break it up, to create havoc so that it wouldn't continue. [Alex] When the FBI was under J. Edgar Hoover, their goal was to create as much conflict between the Panthers and the US, because they were the two most prominent political groups in Los Angeles. A new report from the Senate Intelligence Committee detailing more FBI abuses. The staff report tells how the FBI used anonymous notes to provoke bloody gang wars between the Black Panthers and rival groups. [Jeff] One of the main organizers was a young man named Bunchy Carter, who was a leader of the Slausons gang, and he undergoes sort of a political awakening and signs up and becomes a Black Panther. In a school building at UCLA, there's a shootout between the US Organization and the Black Panther Party, and Bunchy Carter is one of the folks who is killed. At approximately 2:45 p.m. this afternoon, two men were murdered at the UCLA campus. Their names are John Huggins, 23 years old, and Alprentice Carter, 26 years old. It's just one of the tragic moments in LA history, because Bunchy brought that leadership to the youth. [news anchor] Between two and three hundred Los Angeles Police Department officers massed near the Black Panther Party headquarters in Los Angeles. [news anchor] The United States government and the state authorities and state agencies are out to systematically commit genocide on the Black Panther Party. There was just an emptiness in Los Angeles in 1969. Everything just stopped, and it allowed a new generation of teenagers to try to do their own thing. [man] Crip: "continuous revolution in progress." [Alex] When Raymond Washington started the Crips, they wore leather coats. Leather coats became a big deal, because that's what the Panthers wore, so stylistically, they wanted to be like the Panthers. Politically, they didn't have the know-how. Raymond Washington was just a 15-year-old kid. Never been to jail, doesn't know anything about prison at that point in time. He's just a kid that knows how to fight. What Raymond Washington and the other Crips wanted to do was go to the neighborhoods and try to, "Hey, join us." But they said, "Oh, no, no, no. We're--we're fine." All these gangs that have been victimized by the Crips, they come together and say, "Hey, these Crips are just running all over us. We got to defend ourselves." That's when an alliance of all these gangs started to fight against the Crips. [news anchor] To its members, the gang or club or clique or neighborhood is an identity, a defense against the world. But while belonging to a gang is a harmless inclination of many youngsters, in the ghetto, the gang is far removed from fun. Police? They can die. They all can die. I hate 'em. [news anchor] The gang's feelings toward the police and toward the world in general are emphatically expressed in wall paintings and graffiti. In many respects, gang graffiti is the newspaper of the streets. All right, Daryl, you're here, and if you'll look handsome... - [laughter] - ...we will take the vote. All right, there has been a motion to appoint Daryl Gates to chief of police of the city of Los Angeles. - All those in favor, say "Aye." - all: Aye. The motion is carried unanimously. The meeting of the Board of Police Commissioners is now adjourned. [applause] [Daryl] This is truly a great organization. I perceive that this organization can do anything, absolutely anything, if it has the proper leadership. [Alex] Daryl Gates was a protégé of William Parker, so basically we have William Parker from 1950 to 1966. He dies of a heart attack a year after the riots, and then Daryl Gates becomes the chief in 1976 to 1992, so basically we have William Parker as the police chief from 1950 to 1992. [Charlie] Chief Gates was a driver for Chief Parker, and that was part of his training to be chief of police. [Sacha] The mafia has a similar system in that there is driver for the don. Maybe the mafia got that from the police. Well, maybe they both got it from the military, because that is common in the military too. ♪ We're from Watts ♪ ♪ We're from Watts, mighty, mighty Watts ♪ [Karen] In the '70s, as I became more active, the level of repression from the LAPD was very, very severe, so activists would get together, and we would have meetings, and the LAPD would harass us, would infiltrate our meetings.

Daryl Gates--he had files on members of the city council, and during those years, the police chief actually was the most powerful person in the city Because of the way the city charter was written, he couldn't be fired.

Maybe "a normal fashion" instead of "normal people" would have been better terminology. The blacks who died after the application of a control hold, the vast majority of 'em had the onset of a sickle cell anemia crisis. So he was onto something, but when he said it, it came out wrong.

An apartment dweller across the street took this home video after seeing no apparent reason for the police to attack the suspect with boots and night sticks.

We were like, "Holy shit." You know, this video camera revolution. Like, they got it. "Finally," you know what I mean? "Finally we got some evidence. We're going to expose this. This time we're gonna have justice." And this is a terrible thing to say, we all felt bad for his beating, but we cheered the fact that it was finally documented.

He must have done something. He must be doing something to make 'em keep doing that." It's on television, all over the world.

[news anchor] Fifteen-year-old Latasha Harlins was shot and killed by store owner Soon Ja Du. Du claimed Harlins was stealing a bottle of orange juice when she confronted the teenager. Latasha was a beautiful person. She was more like a mother figure. She was their protector. She was always around, making sure nobody messed with her family. She was good at school, and she wanted to be an attorney. She wanted to be an attorney. I remember that day like yesterday because we were supposed to hang out, go to the movies, and... my grandmother told me to go to the store to get some orange juice, and it's the same store, the same time. And I said, "No, I don't feel like it." You know, me and my sarcastic mouth. "I don't feel like going." And she said--and she said, "Okay. Don't worry about it. I'll wait till Tasha get home." I said, "Okay." And she just never made it home. I was so devastated because I could have been there. I probably--it probably would have been me, I don't know, but I could've-- I should have been there. When my grandmother told me to go get the juice, go, I should have just went and got the juice. Soon Ja Du starts yelling at her, like, "Why are you stealing this, bitch?" Like, "Quit stealing this." So she's like, "I'm just trying to get this, you know, to pay for it." Right? And Latasha Harlins is turning to walk out and leave, and she fires the gun. It's fucking bullshit. You know?

There was no, like, you know, they didn't greet them, you know, at the airport. "Hey, you better read up a little bit on civil rights history so you can maybe, you know, when you open up that store in the hood, maybe you might avoid 1992 that's gonna happen to you in a couple of years." It was the wedge that split apart in a very open and visceral way, the Korean immigrant community and the African-American community. Why don't you open up a market that we can use for our families? Go back to Korea! We're the one making you-- why don't you hire blacks? Why don't you hire blacks? Ice Cube put a record called "Death Certificate" and had a song called like "Black Korea." This is what everyone was listening to, my age, my color. That came out before the riots as well, I believe.

If you don't have these things like truth speakers through, you know, music or art, then all you have is the media, you know what I mean? All you have is the news. And that's your main source of what truth is. That was like the other side for me to kind of listen to these other stories and voices. And a lot of my friends were like, "We're boycotting Ice Cube. Fuck that dude." You know? But what gave Soon Ja Du the right to take Latasha Harlins' life? And who are we actually defending here? Now, in that case, justice was actually partially served because Soon Ja Du was found guilty. She was found guilty of manslaughter. If you or I were found guilty of manslaughter in the state of California, we're probably going to be sentenced to 15 years in prison. That's a typical sentence for that offense. So the jury did their job in Soon Ja Du. It was the judge, Judge Karlin, she gave Soon Ja Du five years probation for shooting a girl in the back of the head. That's unheard of! To suggest that any sentence that this court might give results in the conclusion that black children don't receive full protection of the law, that is dangerous rhetoric.

We were in the studio, and the news broke that the cops were, you know, let go. It sends a bad message. It says it's okay to go ahead and beat somebody when they're down and kick the crap out of 'em, and it's okay because if it's not videotaped, don't worry about it, another brother officer won't turn you in, and your brother officer does turn you in, don't worry, we'll get white jurors or whoever who takes and you'll walk.

I'm there getting a chili dog, I love the chili dogs, and then this sister, she said, "They let them white motherfuckers go." Everybody like, "Oh, fuck this. Not again." There was so much negative energy in the city. Rodney King had his trial right here on the street where he got beat. Those four policemen were not judge and jury, and I don't care what he did, if he did anything. That did not give them the right to beat him out here. They need to come out here and take a beating like that 'cause that was not right. Several of the officers had obviously done things that I thought were ineffective, overly brutal, and probably criminal. [Sacha] So you're saying, Chief Beck is saying that the verdict was wrong? No, I didn't say that. [Sacha] Well, so what are you saying? I'm saying--I'm saying what they did was wrong. Right? [Sacha] So you think the verdict was fair in-- Oh, no. Excuse me.

[Gumbel] There are quite a few police officers gathered here outside the courthouse now to maintain order, as each of the four LA cops leaves. I do not seek to explain the jury's decision, because frankly, no explanation makes sense. What were the rules, let's say, like, rules of engagement for the police officers? Could they do this? Or could they do that? And the testimony that we heard is, yeah, they could do it. If the guy was resisting arrest, they could swing their batons until he stopped. But I do know this: The jury's verdict will never outlive the images of this savage beating, seared forever into our minds and our souls. This was a modern-day lynching. Cops can make mistakes, and we sure make mistakes, but we pay for our mistakes, you know? We pay for our bad decisions. We go to jail for our bad decisions or we die for our bad decisions. There's some type of consequence, but for them, it just seems over and over and over, they just have to--they just have to, you know, a right to kill or beat the shit out of you.

About a minute and a half, two minutes later, I didn't see any units. So I get on the radio again, and then she says, "Commander 12 rescinded your order." And I thought to myself, "What is happening? What's going on here? This is crazy. There's no police there." [man] The police were marshalled within four blocks of where it started. If they had just gone there and stopped it, there would never have been a riot. [Karen] Of course we learned later that our illustrious chief of police was on the other side of town at a fundraiser to fight the ballot measure that we were organizing around to bring him under control. What he did was, he basically said, "Okay, you guys don't like police? Fine. None will be around." There's no way to explain no police officers, because you're talking about an area that was always heavily policed. [horns blaring] About eight o'clock or so, Chief Gates showed up. [man] What have you been able to do so far tonight, Chief Gates? Well, we're, I think, slowly getting in control. As you see, we're out in force and officers are beginning to make arrests more and more, and I think we will begin to impress upon the people in this area that we mean business. [Charlie] The city, it's just aglow with fire. Total chaos. Total chaos. [indistinct radio chatter] ♪ jazzy music ♪ [Eric] I remember driving from my house. I lived in Carson, who bordered Compton. I get on the 110 freeway. Firetrucks, emergency vehicles, police officers, just flying up and down the freeway, smoke, fires. [Everlast] Me and B-Real, we were fucking smoking crazy ass weed and shrooming our brains out. And as we're coming over the last hill before you see the greater part of LA, it looks to me like LA is on fire. And I say to B, I was like, "Yo, it looks like everything is on fire, dude." He was like, "Dude, it does." We were fucked up. [B-Real] All you could see is black smoke all through the city coming into Los Angeles. We were fucking like, "Whoa, what the fuck? Is this the apocalypse?" [horn blaring] [news anchor] The anger kept pouring out. Crowds soon began throwing rocks and bottles and setting fires. Still, the police held back. The greedy began looting, and it continued for hours unchecked. Dozens of buildings have been torched and firetrucks couldn't get anywhere near for fear of being attacked. I was at fire station 17, which is on the east side of Los Angeles in the industrial area. We were at the furniture building, and we needed some fuel for the chainsaw, so I ran back to get the fuel, and this lady came running at me with this ax, and since I was in the compartment with the chainsaw, I just grabbed it. So I started it up and I told her, I said, "Don't miss." And she looked at me, smiled, dropped the ax. And then she left. And I was--I was like, "I really didn't want to have to go there, but I would have went there." - [indistinct chatter] - [horn honking] I got some video you would love! I swear to God!

Get your anger, your frustration, your hard feelings, not out on the streets, not breaking windows, not looting, not rioting. This is what bothers me.

[siren blaring] [George Bush] I'm one who respects our police. They keep the peace, they face danger every day, they help kids, they don't make a lot of money, but they care about their communities and their country. Thousands of police officers and firefighters are risking their lives right now on the streets of LA and they deserve our support. [indistinct radio chatter] [man] How are those Rice Krispies? Hey. Right in the box. [indistinct chatter] Since the start of it, the very start. Do you feel any fatigue at this time? Yeah. I'm tired, I'm wearing down, nobody can make a decision. You got all these damn brass that, uh, try and make a decision, and it ends up that the troops out there in the field are getting left out. You have the incompetents who are now leading us, and they can't even lead the troops as it is. So I don't even know what the hell we're doing out here. [Dee] The police were more interested in containment, not stopping it whatsoever. They were not allowing people to come up and here and then loot and tear up Beverly Hills, but you can stay over there on this side of Wilshire. [chuckles] That was shocking to me, too, like, you know, 'cause you're looking around. You're saying, "Well, where are the police when this is happening?" You watch the news and the news only talked about black people. It really wound up being citywide. I called it the Rainbow Revolt, because white folks were participating in the looting. I had just bought a home in Venice that needed furniture, and the whole place was furnished with stolen furniture. That riot was the fuel for us to kind of misbehave and get a lot of shit out of our system that we had pent up, and we really--really felt good. [Eric] Let's go back to the phones. Hey, what is your name, and where are you calling from? [Joyce] My name is Joyce calling from Long Beach. - [Eric] Yes, Joyce. - [Joyce] We're angry because it's showing that we as blacks together are nothing. That's what they're saying to us.

Who me? ♪♪ [Yo Yo] Just looking at the community, a community that was already suffering, to me it was just like, "Wow," you know? Ten steps back instead of pushing ten steps forward. So I understood... ...but I was still sad about the whole situation. The civil unrest in Los Angeles is now the deadliest in the city's history. Worse than Watts in 1965. In three days of violence this week, at least 37 people have been killed, more than 1,300 injured, there have been more than 3,000 arrests, property damage, over $200 million. [Henry] It, like, breaks your heart to know so many people's lives were affected because of our verdict. I don't know, you know? It's just something you have to live with. I mean, we were all stuck here for a while. Let's--you know, let's... let's try to work it out. You got to be, you know... try and work it out. [Alex] The 1992 riots kind of ended abruptly. It's like, as soon as those tanks hit the street, it was over, just instantaneously. [Pat Buchanan] The one way to stop this riot, it wasn't with a new model cities program announced from Washington. It was with superior force, dealing with hooligans, criminals, and thugs. [news anchor] It was early evening in Watts, scores of police, nervous about any unusual activity, swarmed in to deal with what they believed may be a gang incident. And what they stumbled on turned out to be 600 gang members-- Bloods, Crips, a half a dozen others-- agreeing to make peace. These are cold killers, crying and shit, hugging and shit, and apologizing, and all of this because we saw a bigger cause; we saw a bigger enemy that was--that was more vicious and more serious about getting rid of us than we was about getting rid of each other. [Aqeela] We started celebrating outside. We had a big party that night, folks came from all across the city, and we always have these renegade cops in the neighborhood, and back then it was this cat named Sunshine. And Sunshine told us one day, like, after we organized the peace treaty, we was like, "Sunshine, man, the peace treaty, yo, what's up? You down with it?" And he was like, "It would be a cold day in hell before I ever support the peace treaty." He said, "I make $57,000 a year at the base salary." He said, "I make another 60 in overtime." He said, "I'm putting my daughter through Princeton on your ignorance," and this is what he told us, literally. Thank you very much for the overtime. We do appreciate it. [Perry] They don't necessarily want peace between the Bloods and the Crips. How are they going to fill up the jails if everybody's behaving themself? [Cle] Those three days were the best three days in my fucking life, till this day. I've done a lot of shit, you know what I mean? But those there days, I'll never forget 'em, and I'll cherish those days, because at this time, we were so brutalized and we were so uncounted. I used to really wonder, like, "Do they even know what's going on down here?" We finally had this spotlight and their attention on us, my little Mayberry, my little South Central; now the whole world is checking this out, like, "What's going on there?" [woman] Is there anything you'd like to say to my family who lost a business during the riots? Uh, I would say to anyone who lost anything during the riots that I'm deeply, uh, deeply grieved by that and grieve that the Los Angeles Police Department was not able to--to protect everyone. We just do not have enough people. I hope the people in your community and every community will realize that, you know, some misinformation about my not sending out the National Guard. I sent it out just as quickly as we had the National Guard. Well, there were accusations that you delayed in bringing the police department into the riots because you, um, wanted to show what would happen without the police department. How do you feel about those accusations? If nothing else, I'm a-- I'm a consummate professional. We'd never do a thing like that, and besides, the Rambo in me wouldn't allow that to happen. [gunfire] [news anchor] Critics have urged police chief Daryl Gates to step down early because of the department's performance during the riots. I am concerned about the department, and I think the department is at a point where it's taken a lot of hits because a lot of anger has been directed at me. It's until the 1992 riots that we have a new chief, and they decide we have to go out of the city to get a chief. They can't even hire a chief within the department because they didn't want to another William Parker protégé, and that's when they got Willie Williams from Philadelphia. That just goes to show you how effed up the LAPD was internally; they couldn't even find a chief from within to take over the reins during this much tumultuous time. ♪ pensive music ♪ [Dee] The legacy of the riots. When you look at what's happening now with the shootings, what's going on with police brutality, it seems like nothing's changed. We're catching it and we're still not getting the justice. It's still not that feeling of, "Oh, we got it on camera now; we're gonna win this time." It's still like, "We have to fight even harder." I think you should be proud as a black man, because you stood your ground and said this is unjust, and if you're going to keep up with the shenanigans, well, you're gonna feel it. I took it upon myself to say we got to develop a relationship with these police, 'cause they ain't going nowhere. They're in our neighborhood, and we got to stop them from beating us down. [man] Six motherfucking police out here. [news anchor] In an officer involved shooting, the LA Police Commission has just ruled that the shooting death of a homeless on skid row was justified. [Norwood] The system ain't not a goddamn bit different. Thank you, Black Lives Matter, for making people stand up on a regular basis, 'cause that's actually a path to a solution, is you got to stand up and you got to keep standing up. How many more black people have to die till LAPD listens to us? [Patrisse] In the last four years, we have had some of the most officer involved shootings that result to death in Los Angeles. Carnell Snell, Ezell Ford, Renell Jones, Wakiesha Wilson... - Say her name! - [all] Wakiesha Wilson! - Say her name! - [all] Wakiesha Wilson! The way that we are identifying our dignity is showing up in the streets for the people that they keep killing. [all] Fire Charlie Beck! Fire Charlie Beck! [woman] Y'all just didn't take his life; y'all took me and family life. So from today, fuck this protesting shit. I'ma start taking y'all lives. [news anchor] Chief Beck later said, "To target someone because of their profession is no better than targeting someone because of their race." [Ruben] There's the LAPD before 1992 and there's LAPD after 1992. The before was a brutal, racist institution that kept poor people and people of color in their place. Post-1992, it's still serving some of that function, but it's an institution that has more checks and balances. The community is now much more organized and pushes back a lot harder. We never had communication with police, and we're trying to start a whole new beginning by getting that dialogue and that communication. Like the chief said, we were talking to him and hearing and listening and trying to find a better way to bridge the gap between us and them. [news anchor] Chief Charlie Beck says transparency and trust are key. [Alex] What law enforcement does in Los Angeles is use certain words to try to calm-- calm the community, calm the city, and they know which words work. One of the words that works is saying, "We're going to be transparent." And you start to see other chiefs in other cities try to say the right thing, and the reason why they're talking this way in these press conferences and trying to say the right thing and claiming transparency is because they don't want to see a riot in their city. [Sacha] If you were me and you were in my body, would you be afraid of the police? Based on what's going on in the world, in America, would you be afraid? Would you be nervous to drive in a car with your son? Would you be afraid if you had any interaction with the police? So I'll tell you a story. So for about... four or five years of my career, I worked surveillance, and I had very long hair in a time when very long hair was not popular, and, you know, my job was to, um, work criminals in tough neighborhoods. And I have, literally, because of the way I looked and the car I drove and the way I drove, I've been stopped hundreds of times, hundreds, and there is-- there is always tension. Always. The solution to that is empathy on both sides of the glass. You know what, think about-- think about what the police officer is going through as he approaches a car, maybe at night, maybe it's dark, maybe he has information you don't know about, think about what he's going through and try to empathize with their situation. And what I tell my cops is, that--the driver. Empathize with his situation. You know? Maybe he's never been pulled over before. Maybe he just got pulled over yesterday by some--by an officer that didn't treat him very well. You know? Have some empathy. And if there's empathy on both sides of that transaction, you know, then everybody's going to be fine. [Sacha] So you believe if I carry empathy in my heart that I'm less susceptible-- Well, if you display it, display empathy-- in other words, if you understand what the actions of the police officer and therefore you know, recognize that they are-- they may be on edge as they approach, that, you know, the initial encounter is the most dangerous part of a traffic stop. I think that you have to remember those things, you know, and if you do those things, then, certainly in Los Angeles, you know, we don't see issues that come out of that. [Sacha] All right. Well, I guess if the empathy is mutual, because... - Well, not-- - People allege that they do all the right things and police officers are still sort of on edge. So I guess you just gotta hope that humankind can prevail over scared police officers and scared people in cars. Well, and I agree with that. And that's why I think this is, you know, from my point of view, this is one of the most, you know, everybody talks about the conversation, you know? And-- [Sacha] As in the conversation. As in "the" conversation. [Sacha] Which is what? Which is the conversation between parents and particularly their teenage and adult sons about how to act when you get stopped by the police. When you're driving down the street and you see those lights in your rearview mirror, about the last thing you're thinking about is whether or not the police officer that's getting ready to stop you is having a bad day. Or if you do think about that, you say, "Oh, my God. I hope he's not having a bad day. Otherwise I might get shot." It really is sad, you know? I was always happy I didn't have a son for the gang aspect of living and just from, you know, what it takes to become a young black man in this world. I was just happy that I didn't have to deal with those issues. You know? We've had leaders within the community who are gang leaders who have tried to make positive change. But it takes all of us. We can't continue to let this devil manipulate us to kill each other. It's crazy. I still have problems losing my children to gangs. I still went through that. - [Sacha] You, yourself? - Yes. My grandson was just murdered last year. It's-- [exhales sharply] Mm. You know, it happens in our communities, and it's heartbreaking. And I'm one of the aware ones that raised my children to understand and to read and get an education. And I still... I still lost my grandson. I was--I was angry. I was angry. I used to tell my mom, you know, if I make it to 18, I'm gonna suicide bomb a police station. I hated, hated, hated the police. He was pretty radical. - Yeah. - It was very-- it was scary for me to listen to him talk. And I have to say this, I'm happy that we can have this conversation all here together, our entire family, because he used to tell me, "I'll be lucky if I see 21." Let me tell you something about my son real quick. Nicholas! Come here real quick. Come here. Hurry up. Hurry up. Come right here. This is--this is something that us as people of color should never have to go through. Take this hat off. Take the hat off. Sit down. Tell this gentleman what I taught you about when we get pulled over by the police. What should you do? Um, put your hands up on the dashboard so the police don't think you have any weapons or to show your hands. - And how old are you? - 12. I got to tell a 12-year-old how to conduct himself when he interface with law enforcement because I'm scared that if he acts silly and does something with his hands, they will kill him. They've already killed Tamir Rice, who was 12 years old. So I got to teach him how to conduct himself, where to put his hands, how to behave, where to position them, so that we can make it where? After the end of the day, where we going? - Home? - Home. Thank you.
