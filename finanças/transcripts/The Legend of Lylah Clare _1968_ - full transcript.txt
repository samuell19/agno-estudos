Man: OH, THIS LOUSY PROJECTOR. I HOPE IT STILL WORKS. THERE. I THINK I'VE GOT IT. THIS IS THE ONLY PICTURE I HAVE OF LYLAH IN COLOR. DESPITE WHAT YOU MAY'VE HEARD, THIS IS THE ONLY TIME SHE POSED IN THE NUDE. YOU CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT A REALLY BIG STAR SHE WAS. I MEAN REALLY BIG! EVERYBODY LOVED HER, WORSHIPED HER. Woman: SHE HAD A STRANGE KIND OF APPEAL, DIDN'T SHE? Man: SHE WAS A FAVORITE OF ALL THE FAN MAGAZINES, TOO, AND FAN MAGAZINES WERE VERY IMPORTANT THEN, VERY IMPORTANT. HERE'S A PICTURE SHE LIKED VERY MUCH: A WARDROBE STILL FROM THE LOVE THAT FLAMED. THEY WERE REHEARSING FOR IT WHEN THEY GOT MARRIED. THE WORST THING HE EVER DID. WHAT, NOT MAKING THE PICTURE? NO. MARRYING LYLAH. LEWIS ZARKAN IS NO BOY SCOUT, BUT THAT GIRL, WHOO! TRAMP, DEGENERATE, NO OTHER WORD FOR HER. Man: HERE'S THE WEDDING PICTURE, AND THEY LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER, BUT NOT FOR LONG. BUT THERE WAS REAL GRIEF, TOO. EVERYONE WHO KNEW HER-- CAMERAMEN, CREW, EVERYONE-- THEY WERE ALL AT HER FUNERAL. WHAT ABOUT THE BOY WHO DIED ON THE STAIRS WITH HER? WHAT KIND OF A FUNERAL DID THEY GIVE HIM? BECKY, WHERE'S LYLAH'S DRESS-- THE ONE I WANT ELSA TO WEAR FOR THE INTERVIEW? YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO LIKE THIS. WON'T IT BE A LITTLE DATED? NO, NO. IT'S A CLASSIC. THAT'S HIM. THAT'S LEWIS ZARKAN. THOSE DAYS, HE WORE A BEARD. MY BROTHER GOT IT OUT OF WARDROBE AFTER SHE DIED. KEEPS IT LIKE OLD LOVE LETTERS. ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT. SHOW IT, PLEASE. PURE SILK. THAT'S ALL SHE'D EVER WEAR, BART SAYS. IMAGINE THAT. FRIENDS SHE HAD, STRAIGHT FROM THE GUTTER, BUT NEXT TO HER SKIN--HO HO! IT HAD TO BE PURE SILK. NO. NO, THANK YOU. I-- YOU DON'T LIKE IT? YOU GOT GOOD TASTE. BELIEVE ME, YOU'VE GOT GOOD TASTE. I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. I AM, BUT-- BUT YOU SAID YOU WERE INTERESTED IN ACTING. BUT AS MYSELF. AS ME. I'M ALL WRONG FOR HER, WRONG. I JUST WOULDN'T WANT TO... I COULDN'T BE LIKE HER. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE LIKE HER, JUST ACT LIKE HER. Becky: GOD FORBID. BECKY, PLEASE. HE'LL TEACH YOU ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW. EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO HATE HIS GUTS ADMIT HE'S SOMETHING OF A GENIUS. YEAH, BELIEVE ME, OUT HERE THAT MAKES A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK HE'S PRETTY SMART. WELL, THAT'S THE LAST OF THEM. EXCUSE ME, PLEASE. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE BATHROOM, IT'S DOWN ON THE RIGHT. YOU'LL FIND IT. OH. THANKS. YOU'RE A BIG HELP, YOU KNOW? SO I'M A BLABBERMOUTH. SHE'S A NICE KID. WANT ME TO LIE TO HER? OH. [WOMAN SPEAKING IN GERMAN] LYLAH! LYLAH! LYLAH! [LAUGHTER] LYLAH. HA HA HA! Bart: LEWIS, LEWIS, LEWIS. HA HA HA! WHY AM I COMING ON SO STRONG? I'LL TELL YOU. BACK AT THE MAYO CLINIC, I HIT BIG CASINO, OUR AMERICAN EUPHEMISM FOR CANCER. OF THE LIVER, NO LESS. THEY GIVE ME ONE, MAYBE TWO YEARS AT THE MOST. LEWIS, TWO YEARS. TWO YEARS! WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? HOW ABOUT THOSE APPLES, LEWIS? LOOK BACK OVER MY LIFE. SEE WHAT IT ALL ADDS UP TO? A LOUSY 10%. AH, BUT THINK OF ALL THE PEOPLE YOU'VE HAD 10% OF. ALMOST ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU A COMPLETE PERSON. COMPLETE PERSON? COMPLETE NOTHING. NOTHING TO LOOK BACK ON, NOTHING TO LEAVE. WHAT ABOUT YOUR LIVER? IF IT'S IN THE CONDITION YOU SAY IT IS, MAYBE YOU COULD LEAVE IT TO THE MEDICAL SCHOOL AT U.C.L.A. WHY DON'T YOU LISTEN TO ME? I'VE BEEN TALKING TO YOU ALL NIGHT. WHY DON'T YOU LISTEN TO ME? I'VE NOTHING TO LEAVE BEHIND. NOT A DAMN THING! NOTHING! [GLASS SHATTERS] NOT EVEN MY WINDOW. OH... I TAKE IT YOU'RE TRYING TO CAPTURE MY ATTENTION, BUT, UH, DO COME TO THE POINT. I FOUND LYLAH, REMEMBER? MAYBE YOU DON'T WANT TO REMEMBER. TOO LONG AGO, HUH? THE FIRST TIME I SAW HER IN THAT LITTLE BERLIN BUTCHER SHOP-- OH, COME ON! I SAID THAT-- BUTCHER SHOP! YOU LIFTED THAT STRAIGHT OUT OF THE OFFICIAL BIOGRAPHY. YOU FOUND HER IN A BROTHEL, AND ONE THAT SPECIALIZED IN CATERING TO SOME PRETTY PECULIAR FANTASIES. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I'VE ALWAYS MEANT TO ASK YOU, WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE? OH, YOU'VE MADE THAT JOKE A THOUSAND TIMES, BUT THE FACT IS, I FOUND HER, AND NO ONE ELSE HAD EVEN STOPPED TO LOOK. WHAT? ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT. YOU MADE THE WHOLE WORLD STOP TO LOOK. BIG DEAL, BIG DEAL. BUT WHAT HAVE YOU DONE SINCE? YOU SAY NO TO EVERYTHING. GARBAGE. THAT'S ALL I SAID NO TO. THAT'S ALL THEY EVER OFFERED. FOR 20 YEARS? [LAUGHS] LOOK, WHAT ABOUT YOUR LYLAH SCRIPT? WHAT ABOUT LYLAH CLARE, FILM STAR? YOU'RE HOT NOW. HOT? HA HA HA! ALRIGHT, WARM. BUT SERIOUSLY, LEWIS, THEY'VE REDISCOVERED YOU. ARTICLES, CAHIER DU CINEMA, PARIS, THE CINEMATIQUE. MARVELOUS. THE SECOND COMING OF LEWIS ZARKAN. BARNEY SHEEAN WOULD FINANCE YOU IN A MINUTE. BARNEY SHEEAN? I'M NOT SAYING IT'S LOVE, BUT WITH A VAULT FROM HER OLD PICTURES-- WHO'S OLD PICTURES? ALRIGHT, YOUR OLD PICTURES. JUST TO KEEP THE RECORD STRAIGHT. YOU MAKE THAT PICTURE ABOUT LYLAH THAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF MAKING, AND IT BRINGS HER BACK TO LIFE. BARNEY CAN SELL THE OLD STUFF TO TV FOR A FORTUNE. WHERE DO YOU GET HER... CENTRAL CASTING? THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL YOU ALL NIGHT. I FOUND SOMEONE. I FOUND SOMEONE. I CAN SHOW HER TO YOU. NO. I'VE SEEN IT BEFORE. DREARY LITTLE PUSSYCATS COME MINCING IN HERE LIKE BITCHES IN HEAT. MOVE OVER THERE. BILLING THEIR DIRTY LITTLE BUSINESS UP AND DOWN. DON'T TELL ME YOU HAVEN'T ENJOYED YOURSELF WITH THEM ON OCCASION. THAT'S HARDLY THE POINT. NO, IT'S NOT. NO, IT'S NOT THE POINT, BUT THE FACT IS I'VE NEVER BROUGHT YOU ONE, NOT FOR 20 YEARS, THERE'S ONE THAT'S REALLY WORTH LOOKING AT. HMM? AND WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU? I WANT TO PRODUCE. PRODUCE? YOU WANT TO PRODUCE? HA! WHAT IS THIS, YOUR LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT? I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE IN THE PROPERTY AND ESPECIALLY IN YOU. WHY? I DON'T KNOW. I JUST HAVE A FEELING ABOUT THIS GIRL. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HER THAT STRIKES A CHORD... NO, IT'S MORE THAN THAT. SHE'S RIGHT. I KNOW SHE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. RIGHT FOR WHAT? COMFORTING OLD UNCLE BART IN THE AUTUMN OF HIS LIFE? MAYBE MY CONFIDENCE IS MISPLACED. MAYBE IT'S LIKE EVERYBODY SAYS, YOU'RE AFRAID TO WORK WITH ANYONE BUT LYLAH. YOU KEEP A CIVIL AGENT'S TONGUE IN YOUR HEAD, HMM? Woman: LOVER'S QUARREL? MAYBE YOU TWO SHOULD MOVE TO ENGLAND. THEY HAVE LEGALIZED THIS KIND OF THING THERE. I ALWAYS KNEW YOU WERE FOND OF EACH OTHER, BUT THIS IS TOO MUCH. I THOUGHT YOU TWO GLADIATORS WOULD LIKE SOMETHING TO EAT. Zarkan: STAY RIGHT THERE. A SMALL EXPERIMENT IN PRECISION. BART THINKS HE'S FOUND A GIRL THAT CAN PLAY LYLAH. MARVELOUS, DARLING, JUST MARVELOUS, BUT DO YOU THINK YOU CAN REPLACE ZARKAN? [SPEAKS IN ITALIAN] OH, COME ON, COME ON, COME ON. NO ONE COULD EVER PLAY LYLAH. NO ONE. Bart: WHAT A WAY TO JUSTIFY 20 YEARS OF INACTIVITY, FOOLING WITH GUNS. WHO SAID I WAS FOOLING? NOW COME ON, AIM IT. YOU THINK YOU CREATED HER, CAN CREATE HER AGAIN? NO. YOU CAN'T. SHE'S HERSELF...UNIQUE. WAS. WAS? IS. TAKE A LOOK AROUND THIS HOUSE. SHE WOULDN'T LEAVE US ALL. SUPPOSING YOU DID FIND SOME CHEAP IMITATION OF HER, DON'T YOU THINK THE RESULTS MIGHT BE A LITTLE DANGEROUS? DANGEROUS FOR ALL OF US. REPORTERS, PHOTOGRAPHERS... THEY BRING UP ALL THE OLD MUCK. THEY ALL LIE. AND PROBABLY WILL CONTINUE TO BELIEVE WHAT WE TELL THEM TO BELIEVE, UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU'RE PLANNING TO MAKE SOME LITTLE EMBELLISHMENTS OF YOUR OWN. NOW, FIRE. WELL, ACTION. FIRE! OH, CHE INFERNO! DO AS HE SAYS. FIRE, FIRE. AH! HA HA HA! EXACTLY 50 METERS. THAT'S PRECISION LOADING. [MUMBLES IN ITALIAN] YOU GOT A CERTAIN PLEASURE OUT OF PULLING THAT TRIGGER, NO? NO, I DIDN'T. AH, TOO COMPASSIONATE TO MAKE THE KILL? Woman: HUH, THAT IS SOMETHING WE CANNOT SAY ABOUT YOU. YES, HE MAY HAVE SOME SMALL TALENT AS A FILM DIRECTOR, BUT HIS REAL STRENGTH LIES IN HIS AMAZING INSTINCT FOR THE JUGULAR. YOU HAVE TO MAKE ALLOWANCES, MISS ITALY OF 1900 HERE, GETS A LITTLE EDGY BEFORE SHE'S HAD HER VITAMINS. SO WE HAVE TO PUMP HER UP WITH ALL SORTS OF EXPENSIVE AND HIGHLY ILLEGAL LITTLE GOODIES. DON'T WE? UGH! LEWIS, WOULDN'T YOU EVEN CONSIDER TWO MINUTES? OH BOY. I JUST ASKED HIM TO TAKE A LOOK AT HER, A TINY LITTLE LOOK. CAN IT HURT? THAT'S ALL, AS A FAVOR TO ME. WHAT CAN IT COST HIM? ALRIGHT, BART, IF IT'LL MAKE YOU HAPPY, TROT OUT YOUR CINDERELLA. CHANCES ARE, SHE'LL TURN OUT TO BE ONE OF THE UGLY SISTERS ANYWAY. BUT YOU KNOW ME-- ANYTHING FOR A FRIEND. Woman: IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, BART. CHEER UP. Bart: THESE YOUNG KIDS TODAY. NO SENSE OF TIME. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY THIS, LEWIS, 'CAUSE I KNOW YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME, BUT SHE REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO COME. I GOT HER TO PROMISE SHE WOULD. THERE'S ANOTHER LOST FAVOR. SO? WHAT IF SHE DIDN'T COME? WE HAD A PLEASANT DINNER, JUST LIKE OLD TIMES. NOT EXACTLY. IF ONLY YOU'D SEEN HER. A LITTLE FAR OUT, BUT JUST ENOUGH. HER OLD MAN WAS SOME KIND OF A PREACHER OR SOMETHING BIZARRE. HE DIED A FEW MONTHS AGO. SHE PUT HERSELF THROUGH COLLEGE WORKING ON A TRAPEZE IN A CIRCUS. I DON'T KNOW. SHOULDERS, HIPS, CHEEKBONES...JUST LIKE LYLAH. IT'S UNCANNY. WELL, STOP WEEPING INTO YOUR STRAWBERRIES. NOBODY EVER FINDS A STAR. YOU DIDN'T FIND LYLAH. THEN WHO DID? WHO? YOU FOUND A MODERATELY ATTRACTIVE PIECE OF CLAY. I ADMIT SHE HAD SOME BASIC QUALITIES, BUT IT TOOK MY WORK TO BRING OUT THE FINISHED PRODUCT. Woman: YOU DELUDE YOURSELF. IT WAS ALL THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. ANY ONE OF A DOZEN COMPETENT DIRECTORS COULD HAVE GIVEN HER THE NECESSARY POLISH. ON THE CONTRARY. ANY ONE OF A DOZEN COMPETENT DIRECTORS WOULD HAVE RUINED HER BEFORE SHE BEGAN, IN POINT OF FACT, IT WAS LYLAH'S GOOD FORTUNE TO FIND ME. LEWIS, OF ALL THE SELF-CENTERED, EGOTISTICAL PEOPLE I'VE KNOWN, YOU TAKE THE CAKE. I THINK YOU'RE SICK. I'M NOT SICK, BART. I'M IN LOVE. LOVE? WITH ME. OH. [DOGS BARK] [BUZZ] Man: WHO IS THIS? MISS BRINKMANN. MISS ELSA BRINKMANN? OH, YES, MISS BRINKMANN. WE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING YOU. BASTA! QUIET! [YELLING IN ITALIAN] YOU MAY COME IN NOW. I WILL REMOVE THE DOGS. WELL, STOP POUNCING ABOUT LIKE AN OVER-SEXED DWARF. WE'RE ABOUT TO INTERVIEW AN ACTRESS, NOT TEST HER SEXUAL CAPABILITIES. YOU ARE LOOKING UNUSUALLY HOPEFUL, TOO, MIO CARO. DON'T BE SO SUPERIOR, MIA CARA. MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING HERE FOR YOU, TOO. BART, AS A FAVOR TO UNCLE LEWIS, WILL YOU PLEASE SIT DOWN? [DOORBELL RINGS] OH, YES, MISS BRINKMANN. WILL YOU PLEASE COME IN? NOW SHE CAN WAIT FOR US. LA SIGNORINA BRINKMANN. HUH. ASK HER TO WAIT, WILL YOU PLEASE? YOU'VE HARDLY TOUCHED YOUR STRAWBERRIES. HAVE SOME COGNAC. ROSSELLA? WOULD YOU LIKE SOME MORE COFFEE? SHALL WE? Bart: ELSA! [WHISPERING] Elsa, where have you been? You're two hours late. We were beginning to think you weren't coming. Zarkan: ALRIGHT, WE'RE ALL WATCHING. YOU CAN TURN AROUND NOW. I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE LATE. NOT A BAD ENTRANCE FOR AN AMATEUR, BART... TWO HOURS LATE. AH, THIS IS MR. LEWIS ZARKAN, AND THAT'S MISS ROSSELLA FORTE. MISS ELSA BRINKMANN. Elsa: GOOD EVENING. MR. LANGNER, IS THAT WHERE IT HAPPENED, UP THERE? MISS BRINKMANN ASKED YOU A QUESTION. IS THAT WHERE IT HAPPENED? I'M SORRY. I--I SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED. PERHAPS YOU'D BETTER ASK MISS FORTE. SHE'S OUR HISTORICAL EXPERT. I DON'T EVEN KNOW THIS GIRL. YOU DIDN'T KNOW THE CORONER EITHER, BUT YOU TOLD HIM. NOW TELL HER. I WAS MISS CLARE'S DIALOGUE COACH. DIALOGUE COACH. THAT'S STRETCHING A POINT. UP TO THEN, I MEAN, BEFORE SHE MET LEWIS, WE HAD OUR OWN QUARTERS TOGETHER. THE DAY IT HAPPENED, SHE HAD MOVED HER THINGS UP THERE. SHE HAD GONE FOR A DRIVE ALONG THE COAST. THAT AFTERNOON, I WAS ASLEEP. I HEARD A SCREAM. COMING BACK AT THE FRONT GATE, THIS YOUNG MAN, WILD--A FAN--HYSTERICAL, JUMPED ONTO HER CAR. SHE DROVE FAST UP THE DRIVE TO THROW HIM OFF, BUT SHE COULDN'T. HE CLUNG LIKE AN ANIMAL. SHE RAN UP TO THE DOOR, THERE. AS SHE BURST INSIDE, SHE WAS SCREAMING. HE CAUGHT HER ON THE STAIRS. SHE FOUGHT TO GET AWAY FROM HIM. SHE RAN TO FIND LEWIS. HE CHASED AFTER HER. HE WAS LIKE A CRAZY MAN. HE GRABBED HER. SHE CRIED OUT FOR HELP AGAIN AND AGAIN, BUT NOBODY CAME TO HELP. LEWIS WAS IN ANOTHER PART OF THE HOUSE. AT FIRST, HE COULDN'T HEAR HER. IT WAS LIKE A NIGHTMARE, AN INSANE DREAM. Man: COME ON, TAKE IT ALL OFF. HE WANTED HER AS A MAN WILL WANT, AS A MAN WHO TAKES. FROM SOMEWHERE, SHE FOUND THE STRENGTH TO STRIKE BACK AT HIM, TO PUSH HIM AWAY. Lylah: LET GO! KEEP YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF ME! SUDDENLY, THERE WAS A KNIFE. HE STARTED TOWARDS HER AGAIN, DEFIANTLY, SHOWING HER HOW FOOLISH IT WAS TO TRY TO STOP HIM. POOR LYLAH WAS SO AFRAID, SO TERRIFIED. HE COULD DO IT RIGHT THERE AND THEN, HE SEEMED TO SAY, AS HE CARESSED HER STOMACH WITH THE KNIFE. Lylah: NO! HELP! HELP! HELP! BUT LYLAH CLARE WAS A MOVIE QUEEN, A LOVE GODDESS, AND HE DID NOT COME TO THIS HOUSE TO KILL A GODDESS. SHE MUST NOT BE FRIGHTENED OF HIM, THE BOY SEEMED TO BE SAYING. HE WANTED HER TO UNDERSTAND HOW HE FELT, THAT SHE COULD TRUST HIM, THAT SHE HAD NOTHING TO FEAR. HE JUST STOOD THERE, ARROGANT, OBSESSED WITH LUST. BUT LYLAH WAS NOT A GODDESS, JUST A FRIGHTENED GIRL, AND IN HER TERROR, SHE STABBED HIM... STABBED HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN. HE FELL. LYLAH COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT SHE HAD DONE. Lylah: OH! SHE STEPPED FORWARD TO LOOK. I CALLED OUT TO HER. DON'T LOOK DOWN! Rossella: NO, NO, NO! LYLAH. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU, LEWIS. LYLAH. HEIGHTS MADE HER DIZZY. SHE LOOKED DOWN. IT WAS THEIR WEDDING DAY, LEWIS AND LYLAH'S. WHY HAD SHE GONE OUT? I-I-I'M SORRY. FORGIVE ME. TAKE YOUR COAT OFF. WELL, YOU'RE NOT BEING ASKED TO STRIP. TAKE YOUR COAT OFF. NOW, DO YOU THINK YOU COULD MANAGE TO WALK UP THE STAIRS FOR ME? COME, COME. A LITTLE FASTER. THIS ISN'T A FUNERAL. STOP. NOW, WHEN YOU COME DOWN, YOU'LL NOT BE ELSA BRINKMANN. YOU CAN TRY, JUST FOR THE MOMENT, TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION OF A LADY WITH SOME MODICUM OF SOPHISTICATION AND POISE. Zarkan: THIN. VERY INTERESTING. OH, THAT'S REALLY BRILLIANT. WE ARE MOVING LIKE A DEEPLY OFFENDED TIBETAN YAK! AREN'T WE? Bart: IT'S ALRIGHT, ELSA. WELL? OH, MY GOD! YOU'VE DISCOVERED A SPASTIC CATHERINE THE GREAT. I DIDN'T WANNA COME IN THE FIRST PLACE. PLEASE GIVE ME MY COAT. MY DEAR LADY, NOBODY'S ASKING YOU TO STAY. GIVE ME MY COAT, AND I'LL LEAVE. I DIDN'T COME FOR THIS. I CAME FOR AN INTERVIEW. AN INTERVIEW? AN INTERVIEW. YOU WANNA MAKE A SALE, THE BUYER HAS A RIGHT TO EXAMINE THE GOODS. LET GO! YOU HEAR THAT? SHE HAS DRAMATIC TALENT. SHE DOESN'T WANNA BE TOUCHED. [SHOUTS IN GERMAN] [IN GERMAN ACCENT] KEEP YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF ME! LYLAH. I-I-I'M NOT HER. I'M NOT. NO, YOU'RE NOT, ARE YOU? BUT YOU'LL DO FOR NOW. Man in film: YOU, THE FACE OF AN ANGEL, AND THE STING OF A WASP. [IN GERMAN ACCENT] SHUT UP, YOU BIG SLOB. DON'T YOU KNOW YOU ARE TWO HOURS LATE? AHA, AND WHAT'S THIS? WELL, NOW WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS, HMM? WELL, HOLDING IT UP THIS WAY, IT MIGHT BE SOME NEW UNDERDRAWERS FOR YOUR OLD PA. WELL, IT AIN'T FOR HIM. IT AIN'T, HUH? FOR SOME OTHER SWEETHEART, THEN? MAYBE. OH, NO, YOU... OH, NOW, GIVE IT TO ME, MATT. DON'T. I'M WARNING YOU, MATT. YOU BULLY, YOU. I LOVE YOU. THAT'S THE GOD'S TRUTH, ANNA. Lylah and Elsa: I COULD ONLY EVER LOVE YOU. Both: I... I DIDN'T WANT TO... I'LL NEVER OWN UP TO THAT. I GUESS I CAN'T HELP IT, SO I GUESS I JUST LOVE YOU. SURE I LOVE YOU, MATT. WHAT'S THE USE OF KIDDING MYSELF DIFFERENT? [GERMAN ACCENT] Elsa alone: SURE I LOVE YOU, AND I NEVER LOVED ANOTHER MAN IN MY LIFE BEFORE, NEVER. YOU'RE THE ONLY MAN IN MY LIFE I EVER LOVED. GOD STRIKE ME DEAD IF I'M NOT TELLING THE HONEST TRUTH. HOUSE LIGHTS. I... I'M SORRY. Bart: NO, NO, NO. YOU WERE MARVELOUS! OUR CLASS HAD TO STUDY O'NEILL IN HIGH SCHOOL. BUT THE VOICE. DID YOU HEAR THE INFLECTION, THE INTONATION? HMM. IT'S A VERY GOOD IMITATION. BART HAS COACHED HER VERY WELL. NO, I DIDN'T! Lewis: NONSENSE! SO WELL THAT SHE'D KNOW EACH REEL OF EACH FILM BEFORE WE SHOWED IT TO HER? GET ME BARNEY SHEEAN. AT THE OLD NUMBER? TRY IT. DO YOU THINK HE'LL STILL SPEAK TO YOU? WHAT'RE YOU GOING TO TELL HIM? WELL, STOP PLAYING MYSTERIES! WHAT'RE YOU GONNA SAY TO HIM? [TELEPHONE RINGS] YEAH? WHO? YEAH, HOLD ON JUST A SECOND. WILL YOU, PLEASE? THEY GOT TO BE KIDDING WITH THESE PRICES. [INTERCOM BUZZES] HERE. TAKE DOWN THAT NUMBER. 9007. YEAH? Man: SHEEAN, THE PAINT SHOP PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE WRITERS' BUILDING. THEY SAY IT'S GOING TO NEED 200 GALLONS. WHAT KIND OF A STUPID QUESTION IS THAT? GO AHEAD AND PAINT IT ANYWAY, AND IF IT TAKES MORE THAN 150 GALLONS, ANDERSON WILL BE LOOKING FOR A NEW JOB. YOU UNDERSTAND? WRITERS... WHO IS IT? YOUR MOTHER? NO. IT'S LEWIS ZARKAN. LEWIS ZARKAN? HERE. GIVE ME THAT. HEY, LEWIS! IT'S GOT TO BE 20 YEARS! HA HA! HEY, HOW COME YOU STILL GOT MY PRIVATE NUMBER? UH, YOU KNOW ME, BARNEY. I'VE GOT A GOOD MEMORY. BEEN A LONG TIME, EH? HEY, I HEAR YOUR SON WANTS TO BE A DIRECTOR. YEAH. HE'S FULL OF CRAZY IDEAS. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, BARNEY. DIRECTING REQUIRES ALL SORTS OF THINGS, INCLUDING TALENT. PUT HIM IN THE SON BUSINESS. MAKE HIM A PRODUCER. HE WON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING. OR BETTER STILL, MAKE HIM A DISTRIBUTOR. THEN HE CAN STEAL MORE MONEY THAN HE CAN COUNT. WELL, NOW, LEWIS, WE DIDN'T STEAL TOO MUCH FROM YOU. HA HA HA! AFTER ALL, THAT'S NO TENT YOU'RE LIVING IN, YOU KNOW. LISTEN, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? BARNEY, BARNEY, BARNEY, IT'S LEWIS WHO CAN DO SOMETHING FOR YOU. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT PROJECT I TALKED TO YOU ABOUT ONCE-- LYLAH CLARE, FILM STAR? WELL, I'M READY TO GO. AND I SUPPOSE YOU GOT SOME GREAT NEW ACTRESS TO PLAY THIS, HUH? OF COURSE I HAVE. OTHERWISE, I WOULDN'T BE CALLING YOU. BART LANGNER FOUND THIS GIRL. BY THE WAY, HE WANTS TO PRODUCE. YEAH. YEAH, BART LANGNER DISCOVERED HER? SURE, HE'LL NEGOTIATE A CONTRACT-- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS WITH THE GYM EQUIPMENT? NEVER MIND. I'LL ASK YOU LATER. HERE. YEAH, SURE, SURE. HE'LL PRODUCE IT, TOO. YEAH. WELL, LISTEN, DO YOU MIND IF WE DISCUSS A FEW OF THE DETAILS BEFORE YOU TWO GUYS TAKE OVER THE STUDIO? NO, OF COURSE YOU WANT TO DISCUSS IT. WHAT ABOUT DINNER TONIGHT? NOT A CHANCE. LUNCH TOMORROW THEN. NO. LUNCH IS EASIER, BUT, UH... NO. TOMORROW'S OUT. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, HOW ABOUT THE 18th? WAIT A MINUTE. THAT'S NO GOOD, EITHER. I GOT TO GO SEE ABOUT A HORSE AT DEL MAR, AND I GOT A ROTARY CLUB-- WELL, NOW, HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT? THAT WASHED-UP, TWO-BIT GENIUS JUST HUNG UP ON ME. HA! WHO NEEDS HIM? THE GYM E... HEY, GET YOUR ASS IN HERE RIGHT NOW! WELL? WELL, WHAT? YOU REALLY THINK HE WILL CALL YOU BACK? OF COURSE HE WILL, BUT NOW HE HAS TO WAIT FOR US. BRAVO. THAT'S ONE WAY OF PROVING YOUR POINT. AND EVEN IF IT DOESN'T WORK, IT NEVER FAILS TO IMPRESS THE AUDIENCE, DOES IT? ELSA BRINKMANN. JOHN FOSTER BRINKMANSHIP. IT'S HORRIBLE. WE'LL HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR NAME. Elsa: THANK YOU. I'M HAPPY WITH THE NAME I HAVE. WELL, I'M NOT, AND NEITHER WILL THE PUBLIC BE. ANYWAY, WHAT'S IN A NAME? WHY ARE YOU SO SENSITIVE? IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION TO YOU, I REJOICED IN THE NAME OF "FLACK." LEWIE FLACK. F-L-A-C-K, FLACK. HOW DOES THAT GRAB YOU? THEN ONE DAY, I SAW THIS MAGICIAN, ZARKAN THE MAGNIFICENT. IT WAS A TERRIBLE ACT. I THINK HE FINISHED UP CUTTING HIS THROAT IN A HUNGARIAN LODGING HOUSE. ANYWAY, I LIFTED HIS NAME. SOUNDS A BIT LIKE A TRANSYLVANIAN POX DOCTOR, BUT IT SERVES TO IMPRESS THE NATIVES. WE'LL DO THE SAME FOR YOU. HOW MUCH CAN YOU SEE WITHOUT THOSE GLASSES YOU KEEP TRYING TO HIDE? NEVER MIND. HAIR, TEETH. THAT'S EASY. WARDROBE, WE CAN FIX THAT. I'VE HAD YOUR CLOTHES MOVED. YOU'LL LIVE HERE. YOU'VE DONE WHAT? YOU'LL LIVE HERE. LOOK, I DECIDE WHERE I LIVE. MY THINGS BELONG TO ME! WELL, IF YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED, THERE ARE THE STAIRS. I'M WRONG. YOU DON'T WANT ME. NO. I WANT SOMEONE THAT WILL WALK, TALK, AND GO THROUGH THE MOTIONS THAT I TAUGHT LYLAH. IT'LL BE A 24-HOUR JOB. I'LL RUMMAGE THROUGH YOUR SOUL LIKE A PICKPOCKET THROUGH A STOLEN PURSE. ALWAYS BELOVED, 1937. MMM. YOU'LL FIND MY I.D. CARD, NAME OF ELSA BRINKMANN. ALSO MY DRIVER'S LICENSE, SAME NAME. I CAN'T FORCE YOU, BUT I HOPE YOU DO DECIDE TO STAY. ALSO FROM ALWAYS BELOVED, 1937. IT WAS A VINTAGE YEAR. Bart; THEY WERE ALL VINTAGE YEARS THEN. Elsa: BUT, MR. ZARKAN, I... LEWIS, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU SO HAPPY ABOUT? YOU HAVEN'T GOT A DEAL. HAPPINESS IS A WORD FOR IDIOTS. I HAVEN'T USED IT FOR YEARS. SHE SAT HERE, DIDN'T SHE? IT WAS LYLAH'S. AFTER WORK, WE WOULD SIT FOR DRINKS, WATCHING THE DAY'S RUSHES, LYLAH, LEWIS, AND I. SHE'S DEAD. I'M ALIVE. JUST GOING TO HAVE TO GET USED TO ME. OH, I THINK THAT COULD BE ARRANGED. THAT'S LYLAH CLARE'S DRESS FORM? YES, BARNEY. THAT'S LYLAH'S FIGURE INCH FOR INCH. HMM. LOOKS KIND OF DULL WITHOUT THE MEAT ON IT. OH, BARNEY. SOMEBODY SHOULD REALLY MAKE A COLLECTION OF YOUR REMARKS, YOU KNOW? THEY HAVE SUCH DELICATE WIT. THE DRAWER. THE TOP DRAWER. ALRIGHT. LEWIS WANTS THIS IN SILK. WHITE SILK. I TOLD HIM IT'S A TRIFLE VULGAR, BUT AT LEAST IT SHOULD APPEAL TO YOU... DARLING. HUH. [HUMMING] THINK YOUR OLD MAN'S SOME KIND OF A TYRANT, HUH? YOU LISTENING TO THE WAY THE HIRED HELP IS TALKING BACK? NEVER MIND THE SELF-ADVERTISEMENT. SO CAN I HAVE THEM TAKE IT DOWN TO MY PLACE OR NOT? YOUR PLACE? WHAT FOR? OH, NO, SWEETHEART. I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU, BAMBINO, TI ADORO. ZARKAN SAID TO WORK FROM LYLAH'S OLD DRESS FORM. HE DOESN'T WANT ANYBODY TO SEE THIS GIRL YET, NOT EVEN ME. Bart: ELSA'S MEASUREMENTS ARE REALLY THE SAME. LEWIS SAYS THEIR IDENTICAL. OH, YEAH? HOW DOES HE KNOW? BEEN FINGERING THE MERCHANDISE ALREADY, HUH? HA HA HA! YES. HE'S RIGHT. THEY DO CHECK. THEY ARE IDENTICAL. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. HA HA HA! YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS--UNBELIEVABLE. HE'S GOT HIS NERVE. I DIDN'T EVEN SAY I WANNA MAKE A DEAL YET, AND HE'S ALREADY CLEANED OUT MY WARDROBE DEPARTMENT. LOOK, BARNEY, IF YOU MAKE THE DEAL, YOU CAN USE THE DRESS IN THE PICTURE, AND IF YOU DON'T MAKE A DEAL, THEN I PAY FOR IT DIRECT TO THE STUDIO, CARINO. [INTERCOM BUZZES] Barney: THIS IS YOUR THIRD CALL TODAY, TAYLOR. WHAT DO YOU WANT NOW? Man: I'M SORRY, MR. SHEEAN, BUT I'VE BILL BLAKE ON THE LINE FROM K-TEMP. SAYS HE HAS TO KNOW IF WE'RE GOING AHEAD WITH THE-- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "HE HAS TO KNOW"? DIDN'T I TELL YOU I'D LET YOU KNOW NEXT WEEK? YES, BUT MR. BLAKE SAYS HE'S STILL HAVING TO PAY ALL THE LOCATION COSTS, AND THE CHECK FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL EXPENSES HASN'T REACHED HIM YET. SEEMS MR. BLAKE-- WHO TOLD THEM TO PAY THE LOCATION COSTS? DID I TELL THEM? I DID NOT. THE REASON HE HASN'T RECEIVED HIS CHECK YET IS BECAUSE IT'S LAYING THERE ON MY DESK, WAITING FOR MY SIGNATURE. YES, MR. SHEEAN. IF HE KEEPS SCREWING THINGS UP THE WAY HE IS, THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE IT'S GOING TO STAY. YES, MR. SHEEAN. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PRODUCING THIS PICTURE? YES, MR. SHEEAN. WELL, THEN, QUIT BUGGING ME EVERY 5 MINUTES! AND PRODUCE IT! Bozo: OH, YOU'RE CHARMING TODAY. SO CHARMING. UN ANGELO. Bart: YOU REALLY HAVE YOUR TROUBLES. DON'T YOU, BARNEY? LEWIS SAID TO BE SURE AND GIVE YOU THAT INVITATION FOR THE UNVEILING. WHAT INVITATION? PETER'S GOT IT. YOU'RE THE GUEST OF HONOR. THANKS A LOT. I ACCEPT A FREE DRINK IN THIS TOWN, AND IT ENDS UP COSTING ME A FORTUNE. "AN EXCITING NEW FILM PERSONALITY, PRESENTED TO THE PRESS BY LEWIS ZARKAN." BOY, HE REALLY LIKES THE SOUND OF HIS OWN NAME, DOESN'T HE? Bozo: FOR A MAN WHO STICKS HIS INITIALS ON EVERYTHING, INCLUDING THE TOILET SEAT, YOU'RE PRETTY CRITICAL OF OTHER PEOPLE'S VANITIES, AREN'T YOU? Bart: HA HA HA! HA HA HA! [BART STOPS LAUGHING] HA HA HA! HA! HA. HMM. JUST STICK YOUR INITIAL ON THIS RIGHT NOW. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] ALRIGHT, BOZO. YOU CAN HAVE THE DRESS FORM, BUT JUST REMEMBER WHERE IT CAME FROM. AND REMEMBER, WE HAVEN'T MADE A DEAL YET. AND YOU REMEMBER, I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU WHAT MY FEE IS, EITHER. NEVER MIND. CIAO. CIAO. ARRIVEDERCI. CIAO, BART. Bart: ARRIVEDERCI. Peter: BYE, BOZO. YEAH, YEAH. BARNEY. OH. GRAZIE, AMORE. AHH... YOU, UH... YOU WERE PRETTY BUSY WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG, WEREN'T YOU, AMORE? SURE. WHY NOT? HA HA HA! YOU, UH... NEVER DID SCORE WITH LYLAH, THOUGH, DID YOU? WITH LYLAH? ASK BART. A GUY COULD DO LYLAH ANY GOOD, SHE WOULDN'T GIVE HIM THE TIME OF DAY. TELL ME, THIS NEW BROAD, CAN SHE ACT ANY? WELL, IF LEWIS SAYS SHE CAN ACT, SHE CAN ACT. WHAT MAKES LEWIS THINK I GIVE A DAMN ANYWAY? WHY, I CAN SELL HER OLD PICTURES TO THE TV NETWORKS IN 10 MINUTES. YES, YOU CAN. YES, YOU CAN, BARNEY, BUT FOR PEANUTS. THERE'S BEEN A WHOLE GENERATION BORN SINCE THOSE PICTURES. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO LYLAH CLARE WAS. BARNEY, BARNEY, YOU NEED LEWIS AND HIS PACKAGE. I NEED NOBODY. YOU DO NEED SOME GOOD FILMS. MAYBE ZARKAN COULD GIVE YOU ONE. FILMS? FILMS? WHAT THE HELL EVER HAPPENED TO MOVIES? WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE IN? THE ART BUSINESS? TELL LEWIS HE'S DEAD-- RETROACTIVELY DEAD. YOU TELL HIM I'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THIS BROAD OF HIS, BUT THAT I'M NOT REALLY INTERESTED. AND, UH... JUST REMIND HIM. I MAKE MOVIES, NOT FILMS, AND AS LONG AS I'M ALIVE, THERE'S ONLY ONE BOSS. YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO DIE, POP. YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT! NOW, GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. I'M BUSY. Elsa on tape: CONSIDERING THE KINDS OF PICTURES THE PUBLIC WANTS, I THINK MY BEST SIDE IS GOING TO TURN OUT TO BE HORIZONTAL. Man on tape: IN YOUR OPINION, CAN ACTING BE COMBINED WITH MARRIAGE? WITH MARRIAGE, NO. WITH LOVE, MAYBE. Woman: WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE SPORT? MY FAVORITE SPORT? WELL, IT'S JUST AS GOOD OUTDOORS AS IT IS IN. THAT'S GOT TO BE SHARPER AND FUNNIER, HMM? Woman on tape: WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT STANISLAVSKY? DIDN'T HE USED TO PLAY SECOND BASE FOR THE DODGERS? MAKE IT COME OUTTA YOUR OWN BRAIN. THEN WE CAN GET AWAY WITH IT. Man on tape: WHO'S THE PERSON IN THE WORLD THAT YOU ADMIRE MOST? MY MOTHER. DON'T TELL ME PEOPLE STILL GO FOR THAT STUFF. A LITTLE OLD-FASHIONED, IS IT? Elsa: WELL, ISN'T IT? WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU'RE INVOLVED IN A BUSINESS THAT'S CONCERNED WITH INNOVATION? THE ONLY THING INVENTED IN THE LAST 30 YEARS IS BUTTERED POPCORN AND CROSS-COLLATERALIZATION. ANYTHING NOVEL IS ANATHEMA. THE ONE PERSON WHO IS THE ARCHDEFENDER OF THE STATUS QUO IS THE ONE PERSON WHOSE QUESTIONS I CAN'T ANTICIPATE. YOU CAN'T MISS HER, HOWEVER. SHE WEARS A BRACE. MOLLY LUTHER. ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, AND YOUR ATTITUDE WITH HER IS TO BE COOL, DISTANT, CHARMING. NO MATTER WHAT ANYBODY ASKS YOU, YOU WILL ADDRESS YOUR ANSWERS TO MOLLY. THE HIGH PRIESTESS. YEAH. HOW COME SHE'S STILL SO IMPORTANT? BECAUSE THE BANKS STILL BELIEVE IN HER. BECAUSE THE COMMITTEES STILL BELIEVE IN HER. BECAUSE THE STUDIOS STILL BELIEVE IN HER. DEFENDERS OF CINEMATIC RIGOR MORTIS. HER LEG BRACE IS THEIR STILETTO, BROADSWORD, CLUB. IT ABORTS CAREERS, SMASHES MARRIAGES. ITS SHADOW MAKES THE STRONGEST RUN FOR COVER. THREE MUSKETEERS, '21. ALSO '35, '39, '48. YOU'VE GOT TO BE PUTTING ME ON ABOUT THIS MOLLY LUTHER. DON'T TELL ME PEOPLE STILL TAKES NOTICE OF WHAT SHE SAYS ANYMORE. PERHAPS NOT. IT'S THE THINGS SHE DOESN'T SAY IN PRINT THAT GIVE HER AN EDGE. BECKY, TAKE THOSE DOWN LIKE A GOOD GIRL. LIKE A GOOD GIRL? BOY, HAVE YOU GOT A MEMORY. BESIDES THE ILLUSION OF POWER IS SOMETIMES MUCH MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE REAL THING. KNOWING WHERE MOST OF THE BODIES ARE BURIED IN THIS TOWN, SHE CAN ALWAYS THREATEN TO DISINTER A FEW. BELIEVE ME, ELSA. SHE HAS SOME TEETH LEFT. DON'T WORRY. I'LL CURTSY AND SAY MY PEACE. DO, AND I'LL KISS YOUR HAND. AS LYLAH WOULD SAY, IT WON'T BE MY HAND YOU CAN KISS. DON'T TRY TO BE FUNNY! YOU HAVEN'T THE BRAINS FOR IT! LEWIS, LEWIS, BE CAREFUL WITH THIS GIRL. DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKES YOU MADE WITH LYLAH. REMEMBER, IT'S NOT EVERYONE WHO GETS TWO CHANCES. BART, YOU WERE OUT OF YOUR MIND OVER LYLAH AND SHE LAUGHED IN YOUR FACE, SO YOU WENT CRYING TO YOUR WIFE, AND SHE DRANK HERSELF TO DEATH! NOW YOU'RE GIVING ME ADVICE. NEVER MIND, BART. LIKE MOST BULLIES, HE'S QUITE BRILLIANT WHEN IT COMES TO KICKING PEOPLE IN THE FACE, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE ALREADY DOWN. Rossella: COME, BART. MAY I SEE YOUR INVITATION, PLEASE? HERE YOU ARE. OH, YES, MR. SHEEAN. GO RIGHT ON IN. THANK YOU. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] ASK BOZO TO HAVE HER WEAR THIS. Rossella: LYLAH'S BROOCH? Elsa: FOR LUCK? FOR LUCK. IS HER HAIR GOING TO STAY LIKE THAT? AS LONG AS SHE STANDS PERFECTLY STILL. ANYBODY WOULD THINK HE WAS ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH! HI, MR. SHEEAN. THANK YOU. AFTERNOON, MR. SHEEAN. AFTERNOON, GENTLEMEN. THESE OLD BOYS REALLY KNEW HOW TO LIVE, DIDN'T THEY? Man: THEY SURE DID. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Lewis: PETER. THE OLD MAN SENT ME AHEAD. HE'S STUCK AT THE SAUSAGE FACTORY. SAID COULD YOU PLEASE HOLD UP THE MAIN EVENT 15 MINUTES? WHY? HE'S GOT A COUPLE OF HIGHBROW FRENCH JOURNALISTS OUT THERE DOING A SPECIAL ISSUE OF LIFE: THE FRENCH VIEW OF HOLLYWOOD. HOLLYWOOD CHERCHEZ. AND POP IS FLIPPING. HE'S SHOWING THEM HIS NEW TV BUILDING AND THE WATER TOWER WITH HIS 40-FOOT INITIALS, AND THEY COULDN'T CARE LESS. HMM. GOOD. Bart: I THINK WE OUGHT TO GET STARTED. SIDNEY. HOW'S SNOW WHITE? LEFT HER WITH MARIA. HOW ARE YOU, BART? LEWIS. AH, SIR WALTER. FORGET SIR WALTER. GOOD LUCK, SIR GALAHAD. MOLLY. WHO ELSE? Man: HIYA, MOLLY! Woman: MOLLY, MY LOVE. Molly: YOU LOOK TERRIBLE. SEE A DOCTOR. Man: NICE TO SEE YOU. GREAT COLUMN YESTERDAY. YEAH. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. LEWIS, DARLING! MOLLY, YOU LOOK RAVISHING, AS USUAL. ANOTHER STAIRCASE ENTRANCE? MIND THE STEP, PLEASE. AREN'T YOU BORROWING A LITTLE HEAVILY FROM SUNSET BOULEVARD? I'VE ALWAYS SAID, THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A STAIRCASE FOR A GRAND ENTRANCE. REALLY? I THOUGHT DE MILLE SAID THAT. NO, DARLING. HE WAS THE MILK BAR. HELLO, MOLLY. GORGEOUS AS EVER. OH. HELLO. WELL, THE OLD PLACE LOOKS JUST THE SAME. YES, IT'S...ADEQUATE. SIT HERE, THE PLACE OF HONOR. WELL, NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE, I THINK WE MIGHT START. Molly: WHY NOT? AREN'T YOU GOING TO WAIT FOR BARNEY? WHY NOT? THE INVITATIONS SAID 6:00, DIDN'T THEY? HE'S ALREADY TOLD YOU HE'D BE LATE! SINCE WHEN DID ANNOUNCING YOUR DEFECT EXCUSE YOU? I DON'T SEE BARNEY. NERVOUS? Elsa: MMM. THIS WAS LYLAH'S SPECIAL. THANKS, ROSSELLA. BUT BE CAREFUL. IF YOU CAN'T HOLD IT... [DRUM ROLL] Lewis: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE, MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION? LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU. NOW, UPSTAIRS WAITS A YOUNG LADY WHOM I'M ABOUT TO THROW TO YOU INK-STAINED WOLVES. Man: IT'S ABOUT TIME. AS THIS IS HER FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH YOU GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS AND NO DOUBT A DAUNTING EXPERIENCE, I HOPE YOU WILL TREAT HER WITH ALL THE COURTESY AND CONSIDERATION FOR WHICH THE HOLLYWOOD PRESS CORPS IS SO JUSTLY FAMED. [LAUGHTER] NOW, THIS YOUNG LADY WHO HAS YET TO FACE A CAMERA WILL SHORTLY, IF YOU APPROVE, ATTEMPT ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT ROLES IN OUR MOTION PICTURE WORLD. WHAT THAT ROLE IS, I'LL LEAVE YOU TO GUESS. AND NOW, I SUGGEST, IF YOU MOVE INTO THIS ROOM, YOU'LL GET A BETTER VANTAGE POINT. FREE FOOD, FREE DRINKS, FREE PRESS. AND NOW, MAY I INTRODUCE MISS ELSA CAMPBELL. Elsa: ELSA CAMPBELL? THAT'S YOU. COME ON. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Man: THIS GIRL BETTER BE GOOD. MISS CAMPBELL, DON'T BE LATE ON YOUR FIRST ENTRANCE. [LAUGHTER] CAMERAS ARE ROLLING. ACTION. [LAUGHTER] Lewis: WELL? [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] Man: LET'S HAVE A NICE BIG SMILE. Man: YEAH, THAT'S FINE! Elsa: ALRIGHT. Man: STAND ALONGSIDE THE PORTRAIT. YEAH, GOOD. A LITTLE TO THE LEFT NOW. [REPORTERS SHOUTING QUESTIONS] GENTLEMEN, PLEASE. I'M ONLY A WOMAN. Man: NAME OF THE PICTURE? CHAMPAGNE? Lewis: WHAT DO YOU THINK, MOLLY? IS IT IMPORTANT? YES. IT IS TO ME, VERY. WE'LL SEE, MR. ZARKAN. WE'LL JUST WAIT AND SEE. IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN, LEWIS. Man: COME ON DOWN, ELSA. Man: PRETTY! [REPORTERS SHOUTING QUESTIONS] ONE AT A TIME, PLEASE. YOUR HOMETOWN, MISS CAMPBELL. PRINCE WILLIAM, NEW HAMPSHIRE. Man: I NEVER HEARD OF IT. NOBODY HAS. Woman: WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT ACTORS RUNNING FOR PUBLIC OFFICE? IF IT KEEPS THEM OFF THE STREETS AND OUT OF TROUBLE, I'M ALL FOR IT. TELL US, DID YOU EVER DREAM OF BEING A STAR IN THOSE DAYS? I, UH...USED TO DREAM ABOUT GETTING AWAY FROM PRINCE WILLIAM, NEW HAMPSHIRE. [LAUGHTER] Woman: DO YOU HAVE A ROMANTIC ATTACHMENT AT THE MOMENT, MISS CAMPBELL? NO, REALLY, I... [SPEAKING ITALIAN] THANKS. Woman: MISS CAMPBELL, IN YOUR OPINION, CAN ACTING BE COMBINED WITH MARRIAGE? WITH MARRIAGE, NO. WITH LOVE, MAYBE. Man: SOME ACTRESSES GET AS MUCH AS A MILLION DOLLARS A PICTURE. YOU THINK PRODUCERS SHOULD PAY THAT MUCH? IT'S NOT THE PRODUCERS BUT THE PUBLIC WHO PAYS. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GENGHIS KHAN? I THOUGHT THIS ORGY WAS LAID ON FOR YOUR FATHER'S BENEFIT. IF HE'D HAVE KNOWN IT WAS GONNA BE AN ORGY, HE'D HAVE BEEN HERE. YOU'RE RIGHT. HE'S NOT GONNA BE HAPPY ABOUT THIS. Elsa: I'D SAY A HALF AN HOUR. WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE SPORT? WELL, IT'S... JUST AS GOOD OUTDOORS AS IT IS IN. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT STANISLAVSKY? DIDN'T HE USED TO PLAY SECOND BASE FOR THE DODGERS? SHE'S TAME ENOUGH NOW, LEWIS, BUT WILL SHE TURN INTO A SLUT LIKE THE LAST ONE? IF I THOUGHT SHE'D EVER TRY WHAT LYLAH DID-- SHE WON'T, MOLLY. I ASSURE YOU, SHE WON'T. I WANT HER BROUGHT HERE, LEWIS. RIGHT HERE. Lewis: ELSA! WOULD YOU COME HERE A MOMENT? EXCUSE ME. LOOKS LIKE IT'S TIME TO FEED THE LION. HEY, YOU WERE WONDERFUL. WOULD YOU LIKE A CIGARETTE? I DON'T SMOKE, BUT THANKS, WHOEVER YOU ARE. WOULD YOU? Man: GET A SHOT OF HER, CHARLIE! HELLO. [CROWD GASPS] ELSA, THIS IS THE WORLD-FAMOUS MOLLY LUTHER. WE'VE MET. SHE'S JUST DIRTIED MY DRESS. CIGARETTE. YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T SMOKE. I DO NOW. ONE QUESTION, MY DEAR. JUST ONE? MOLLY, SHE, UH... AND NOTHING FROM YOU, LEWIS, PLEASE. TELL ME, ARE YOU HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH MR. ZARKAN? [CROWD GASPS] MY DEAR YOUNG LADY, ARE YOU HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH ZARKAN? I ESTEEM LEWIS ZARKAN AS A HIGHLY TALENTED DIRECTOR. AS AN INDIVIDUAL-- OH, NOW, NEVER MIND ALL THAT NONSENSE. I PRESUME YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF AN ESTABLISHMENT LEWIS' LAST PERFORMER CAME FROM. ARE WE TO TAKE IT THAT YOUR BACKGROUND IS EQUALLY UNFORTUNATE? OH, COME ALONG, CHILD. SURELY, YOU'RE NOT RETARDED. I'M ASKING YOU, DO YOU SLEEP WITH HIM? [CROWD MURMURING] [GERMAN ACCENT] Elsa: WHY, YOU MISERABLE SON OF A BITCH. [CROWD GASPS] WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT BECAUSE ONCE... YES, MISS LUTHER, MAYBE JUST ONCE YOU SPENT A COZY HOUR WITH LEWIS ZARKAN THAT YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO BE JEALOUS OF HIM? DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE A LICENSE TO ASK ANY DIRTY QUESTION THAT CLIMBS INTO THAT SNAKE NEST BETWEEN YOUR EARS? ELSA, BE CAREFUL. DON'T-- BRAVA. AND NOBODY CHALLENGES YOU. WHY? BECAUSE THEY'RE GENTLEMEN? HA HA HA! I'LL TELL YOU WHY. MOLLY LUTHER'S MAGIC WAND THAT KEEPS HER SAFE FROM... DRAGONS. HA HA HA! LUTHER'S PERSONAL GUARANTEE THAT SHE HAS THE RIGHTS OF GOD ALMIGHTY! IS THIS WHAT YOU USE TO DIG GRAVES UP WITH? NOW, GET OUT! AND DON'T COME INTO THIS HOUSE AGAIN! LEWIS, THIS IS YOUR HOUSE. WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY? YES, LEWIS. WHAT DO YOU SAY? MOLLY, I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT A DIRECTOR SHOULD NEVER UNDERCUT HIS STAR'S BIG SCENE. I'M AFRAID I MUST ASK YOU TO LEAVE. Bart: LEWIS! NO! HA HA HA HA! Bart: NO, MOLLY. DON'T, PLEASE! YOU'RE GOING TO REGRET THIS, LEWIS. BELIEVE ME, YOU'RE GOING TO REGRET IT! AND AS FOR YOU, YOU GRUBBY LITTLE SLUT-- MOLLY LUTHER, THE WICKED WITCH OF THE WEST! YOU THROW WATER ON HER, AND SHE SHRIVELS. SHE MELTS. HA HA HA HA! IMAGINE THAT! SHE REALLY MELTS, AND ALL THAT'S LEFT IS A LITTLE PHONY FLOWER AND A DRIED-UP, DISAPPOINTED FREAK! [PEOPLE EXCLAIMING] Bart: MOLLY! LEWIS! Reporter: MISS CAMPBELL, A PICTURE, PLEASE! THIS WAY. THIS WAY, MISS CAMPBELL. ONE MORE, PLEASE. Bart: MOLLY, PLEASE! WHAT ABOUT YOUR CANE? TO HELL WITH THAT! MOLLY, SHE'S REALLY A NICE KID. MAYBE SHE'S HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK. WHY DON'T YOU WAIT FOR BARNEY? HE'LL BE HERE ANY MINUTE! MOLLY, WAIT! DON'T JUST WALK OUT LIKE THAT, MOLLY. EVERYTHING CAN BE STRAIGHTENED OUT. BE REASONABLE, WILL YOU? BARNEY WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE. PLEASE! PLEASE! OH, HERE HE IS. BARNEY, THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE. HI, MOLLY. Molly: DON'T YOU "HI, MOLLY" ME, YOU-- Bart: TALK TO HER, PLEASE, BARNEY. STOP HER. TALK TO HER. Molly: GET INVOLVED WITH THOSE DEGENERATE SWINE IN THERE! YOU'LL ONLY HAVE YOURSELF TO BLAME FOR THE CONSEQUENCES! ZARKAN'S DUG HIS OWN GRAVE, AND BELIEVE ME, I'M GOING TO SEE HIM... WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ALL ABOUT? YOU JUST MISSED THE ALL-TIME SCREAMING MATCH. STARLET TAKES SWITCHBLADE TO MOLLY LUTHER. I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO HAVE HIM WAIT! I KNOW, DAD. I ASKED HIM TO WAIT. BARNEY, THIS WHOLE THING HAS BEEN A TOTAL DISASTER. I TOLD LEWIS TO WAIT 15 MINUTES! IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK? I KNOW, BARNEY. IT COULDN'T BE HELPED. IT JUST HAPPENED THAT WAY. WELL, ISN'T THAT JUST TOO DAMN BAD? DON'T GO, BARNEY. PLEASE DON'T GO! WE'VE GOT TO FIND SOME WAY TO STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT WITH MOLLY. WE'VE GOT TO FIND? NO. YOU'VE GOT TO FIND. IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM! LOOK. YOU TELL HOTSHOT ZARKAN UP THERE IF HE WANTS MY HELP HE CAN COME TO THE STUDIO AND ASK FOR IT... PERSONALLY! AND HE WON'T GET IT, EITHER! YOU! SONNY BOY! YOU COME WITH ME. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU. BOY, OH, BOY. THAT KIND OF SEMIPUBLIC EXPOSURE NEVER TROUBLED LYLAH. YOU MEAN SHE WAS NEVER ASHAMED OF ANYTHING? IN THE ANCIENT TRADITION. SHE WASN'T COY. NO GIRDLES, DEODORANTS. PROUD OF WHAT SHE WAS--A WOMAN. WHATEVER A MAN NEEDED OF HER, SHE GAVE. OF COURSE--THE MERMAID. EVERY MAN THINKS HE WANTS ONE OF THOSE. YOU MIGHT SAY THAT THAT GREENHOUSE IS SOMETHING OF A MEMORIAL TO HER. WE HAD A JAPANESE GARDENER THAT USED TO LOOK AFTER IT-- NICE LITTLE FELLOW, QUIET AS A CHERRY BLOSSOM. WORKED HERE FOR THE BEST PART OF 10 YEARS, THEN SUDDENLY ONE DAY WE WERE AT WAR. AND THE GOVERNMENT, WHO KNOW A DANGEROUS MAN WHEN THEY SEE ONE, GAVE HIM A FEW HOURS TO PACK UP BEFORE THEY SHIPPED HIM OFF TO SOME GODFORSAKEN CONCENTRATION CAMP IN THE MIDDLE OF A DESERT. LYLAH WAS SO UPSET SHE CAME DOWN HERE TO SAY GOODBYE TO HIM. YOU CAN TAKE MY WORD FOR IT, THAT GARDENER HAD THE MOST UNEXPECTED GOING-AWAY PRESENT HE EVER HAD IN HIS LIFE. DON'T LOOK SO SHOCKED. SHE WASN'T MARRIED AT THE TIME. BUON GIORNO, SIGNORE. BUON GIORNO. I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS A LADY HERE, AND INSIDE IS SO HOT, AND I WORK MEZZO NUDO. Lewis: WE ALL DO. THIS IS PAOLO, OUR GARDENER. I DO HIM AN INJUSTICE. HE'S A GRADUATE HORTICULTURIST. I BROUGHT HIM FROM ITALY. PAOLO, THIS IS MISS BRINKMANN. HELLO. I'M SORRY. E SPORCA. PLACE LOOKS GREAT, PAOLO. GRAZIE, SIGNORE. YOU ARE TOO KIND. I PROBABLY AM. PAOLO. SIGNORE. NOW, IF YOU WERE LYLAH... OH, THAT'S SOMETHING YOU'RE BORN WITH. DO YOU THINK SO? I'VE NEVER SEEN A WOMAN YET WHO HASN'T GOT A WHORE LOCKED UP INSIDE HER SOMEWHERE. WELL, I-- SHH, SHH, SHH. I'M TAKING YOU OUT TO DINNER. IT'S ABOUT TIME WE STARTED FOISTING YOU OFF ON AN UNSUSPECTING PUBLIC. WELL, WELL, WELL! [MOLLY LAUGHS] GOOD EVENING. CAN I HELP YOU? GOOD EVENING. I HAVE A RESERVATION. THE NAME IS ZARKAN. ZARKAN? OH, DEAR. FAME IS SUCH A FLEETING THING. ZARKAN. I DON'T BELIEVE... LEWIS ZARKAN. YOU MUST BE NEW HERE. PERHAPS YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME. YOU'RE THE LEWIS ZARKAN, THE WRITER, AREN'T YOU, SIR? NO. I'M THE LEWIS ZARKAN WHO JUST GAVE YOU $20. THANK YOU, SIR. JUST A MOMENT. I'M SURE THEY ALL THINK I'M YOUR MISTRESS, HMM? DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF. THE ONES THAT KNOW ME KNOW THAT I NEVER SLEEP WITH MY LEADING LADIES-- AT LEAST UNTIL AFTER THE LAST DAY OF SHOOTING. IT GIVES THEM TOO MUCH POWER. NOW, DON'T FORGET THE TIBETAN YAK. Man: YEAH! NO, NO, NO. YEAH. ALRIGHT. ALRIGHT. Peter: ELSA! HELLO. AHA! THE HANDSOME PRINCE LEAPS TO HIS FEET TO KISS CINDERELLA. WHEREUPON SHE WAS IMMEDIATELY TRANSFORMED INTO A MALIGNANT TOAD. Barney: TALK TO YOU. CALL YOU BACK. Peter: BEEN TRYING TO CALL ALL WEEK. YOU NEVER CALLED. Barney: HELLO, LEWIS! I DIDN'T KNOW YOU STILL CAME HERE. I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE FOR YEARS. ME, TOO. QUITE A COINCIDENCE. YOU NEVER TOLD ME THAT HE CALLED. YOU'VE BEEN BUSY, HAVEN'T YOU? BARNEY...AND SON. Peter: CALL YOU TOMORROW? Elsa: MM-HMM. HEY, YOU NEVER TOLD ME SHE LOOKED LIKE THAT. YOU NEVER ASKED. Lewis: THANK YOU. Waiter: YOU'D LIKE A COCKTAIL BEFORE DINNER, SIR? NO. BRING ME A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE, PLEASE. YES, SIR. ANY PARTICULAR BRAND? WHATEVER YOU THINK IS APPROPRIATE. FINE. THANK YOU, SIR. HOW AM I DOING? SHOULDN'T YOU GO OVER AND TALK TO MR. SHEEAN? I DON'T THINK SO. IF HE HASN'T COME OVER BY THE TIME WE FINISH THE FIRST BOTTLE, I'LL RECONSIDER. HELLO. WE'RE ABOUT TO GET A PEACE FEELER FROM THE ENEMY. LEWIS, I DON'T BELIEVE I'VE HAD THE HONOR. OH, I'M SORRY, BARNEY. I COULD HAVE SWORN I SENT YOU AN INVITATION. MISS CAMPBELL, MR. SHEEAN. HONORED. MY SON TOLD ME I'D MISSED SOMETHING. YOU DID. HEH HEH HEH. I CAN SEE THAT. LOST MY GUTS, HUH? STILL WRITING YOUR CONTRACTS ON MATCHBOXES? HEH HEH HEH. LOOK, LEWIS, MY BOY'S ENTHUSED ABOUT THE GIRL. TAKE HIM ON AS YOUR ASSISTANT. LET HIM GET HIS FEET WET. DON'T SEE WHY WE CAN'T MAKE A NICE LITTLE PICTURE. FOR THE BOY. WELL, I'M GETTING OLD, SOFT IN THE HEAD. MONEY DOESN'T MEAN WHAT IT USED TO. BESIDES, THERE ISN'T A DIRECTOR IN TOWN THAT COULD TEACH THAT KID MORE. THIS JUST MENTIONS A DEAL. IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE FIGURES. LIKE YOU SAID-- DOUBLE YOUR LAST FEE. YOU TAUGHT ME ONE THING ABOUT THIS BUSINESS, BARNEY. ONLY ONE? WHAT'S THAT? BRING ME ANOTHER GLASS. NEVER TO READ THE FINE PRINT UNTIL YOU'VE HAD A GOODNIGHT'S SLEEP. BESIDES, I PROMISED MISS CAMPBELL A NIGHT OFF. PRETEND I'M NOT HERE. AH, LIKE PETER SAYS-- SMART GIRL. CAN I HELP YOU, SIR? UH, NO, NO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI, PETER. COME ON. SIGN IT. SIGN IT! WELL, WHAT WILL WE EAT FOR DINNER? FUNNY, BARNEY, I HAD THE DISTINCT IMPRESSION WE'D BE EATING ME. HA HA HA! HI, BARNEY, LEWIS, ELSA. HI, BART. JUST ARRIVED. EXCUSE ME. YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN THIS. EVERYBODY IN TOWN KNEW ABOUT IT EXCEPT UNCLE LEWIS. YOU DON'T GET TO OWN YOUR OWN STUDIO BY FOLLOWING THE BOY SCOUT MANUAL, DO YOU? LOOK, ZARKAN, ANYBODY'S ENTITLED TO MAKE THE BEST DEAL THEY KNOW HOW, RIGHT? IF YOU'RE BARNEY SHEEAN, THAT INCLUDES DECEIT, SUBTERFUGE, BLACKMAIL, AND HIGHWAY ROBBERY. LOOK, IF YOU'RE TRYING TO PROVOKE ME, YOU'RE JUST WASTING YOUR TIME. YOU CAN'T BE PROVOKED? WHAT'S THE MATTER-- YOU TOO STUPID? I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT. BARNEY SHEEAN, CAPTAIN OF INDUSTRY, MAN OF LETTERS, SCHOLAR... AND CONSUMMATE THIEF! LOOK, YOU-- LEWIS, THAT'S ENOUGH. IT SURE AS HELL IS! I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THIS! NO, YOU DON'T. YOU JUST HAVE TO MAKE PICTURES. OH, I BEG YOUR PARDON. YOU MANUFACTURE DEVICES-- DEVICES THAT ARE EVENTUALLY SOLD BY FILM FOOT TO TV, AND WE ALL MILK WHITE BEFORE THEY GET TO MARKET. THE BUDGET IS FALSIFIED. WHAT DO WE HAVE? FOREIGN DISTRIBUTION, MUSIC CORPORATIONS, PUBLICITY, PRINTS, POPCORN, POPSICLES, AND EVERYBODY CHEATS ON THOSE! MURDER'S OUT AND THIEVERY'S IN, ISN'T IT? YOU'VE ALWAYS GOT TO BE KNOCKING SOMETHING, HAVEN'T YOU? LOOK, IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS COUNTRY, WHAT MADE YOU COME HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE, HUH? YEAH, AND I SEEM TO REMEMBER YOU WERE PRETTY HAPPY PUTTING OUR DOLLARS IN YOUR POCKET. HERE'S THE BLACKMAIL SECTION OF THE CONVERSATION. IT'S UNPATRIOTIC TO ARGUE WITH BARNEY SHEEAN. IT'S DOWNRIGHT UN-AMERICAN TO BE UNKIND TO HIM. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE COUNTRY. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU! ALRIGHT, SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ME. NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU. YOU WERE WASHED UP AS A DIRECTOR ALL OF 20 YEARS AGO! YOU'RE NOTHING! THE ONLY THING THAT CAN CHANGE THAT IS ME OR SOMEONE LIKE ME. ALL MY LIFE, I'VE TAKEN CHANCES BETTING ON PEOPLE. SOMETIMES I WIN, SOMETIMES I LOSE. I BET ON YOU, AND I WON. NOT ALL THE TIME-- SOMETIMES I LOST. BUT WINNING KEEPS ME IN THIS BUSINESS, KEEPS ME ALIVE, KEEPS US ALL ALIVE-- INCLUDING YOU! SO WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO SNEER AND ACT SO GODDAMN SUPERIOR, HUH? I'M NOT SNEERING. YOU ONLY THINK I'M SNEERING BECAUSE SOMEWHERE DEEP DOWN IN THAT NEANDERTHALER HEAD OF YOURS YOU'RE VAGUELY AWARE OF YOUR ABYSMAL IGNORANCE! HMMPH! YEAH. I'M SO IGNORANT THAT, WITHOUT ME, BUMS LIKE YOU WOULD BE MAKING HOMEMADE MOVIES FOR AN AUDIENCE OF ONE! IT'S NOT YOUR CRUMMY INTELLECT THAT KEEPS THIS BUSINESS GOING. IT'S MY MONEY! YOUR MONEY! ALRIGHT, SO IT'S THE PEOPLE I GET TO INVEST. THAT'S BETTER. AHA! BUT WHEN DID YOU LAST GET ANYBODY TO INVEST IN ONE OF YOUR PICTURES, HUH? ALL I WANNA DO IS PRODUCE A MOVIE. LET'S GET THAT SETTLED. THEN YOU GUYS CAN KILL EACH OTHER. OH, NOW THE PRODUCER-- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU BUTTING IN FOR? WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? JUST MAKE ME THIS PICTURE. MM-HMM. I GET THE OKAY ON FINAL CUTTING. THERE ARE ONLY 4 DIRECTORS IN TOWN GET THAT. 5. Lewis: AFTER 7 YEARS, THE NEGATIVE REVERTS TO ME. AND SINCE YOUR NETWORKS SEEM TO THINK THIS MAKES THE DEAL SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING, I WANT 15% OFF THE TOP OF ANY TV SALE. I WOULD SOONER COMMIT SUICIDE. I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THIS CRAP! YOU CERTAINLY DON'T. I'LL GIVE YOU THE STORY. AS FOR MISS CAMPBELL.. ELSA, I THINK MR. SHEEAN'S MAKING YOU A PROPOSITION. HE'S SUGGESTING THAT YOU MAKE THE PICTURE WITH ANOTHER DIRECTOR. NOW, THAT'S A HELL OF AN IDEA! HA HA HA HA! [GERMAN ACCENT] BARNEY, DARLING, YOU ARE SO MUCH SMARTER WHEN YOU DON'T TRY TO THINK. HA HA HA! HASN'T ANYBODY EVER TOLD YOU THAT BEFORE? SOMEBODY MUST HAVE. YOU GOT A DEAL. AFTER WE SIGN. OKAY. OKAY. BUT ON ONE CONDITION-- 6 MONTHS FROM TODAY, THAT PICTURE IS FINISHED-- IN THE CAN. OKAY. Elsa: CONGRATULATIONS, BARNEY DEAR. Lewis: I DON'T SEE CROW ON THE MENU. WHAT WILL YOU HAVE TO EAT, BARNEY? WHAT? I'M NOT HUNGRY. Elsa: AUF WIEDERSEHEN. KEEP YOUR EYE ON THAT CAMPBELL KID. SHE CAN BE IMPORTANT TO US. YOU TOLD ME NEVER TO GET INVOLVED WITH THE HELP. FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! I DIDN'T SAY YOU HAD TO JUMP UP AND DOWN ON HER. NOW, SIGN THE CHECK. I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. COME ON, YOU GUYS. Peter: HEY, POP-- GOING STRAIGHT HOME? YOU SON OF A GUN! YOU'RE GETTING A CHANCE THAT DOESN'T COME TO ONE MAN IN A THOUSAND! OH, I JUST DON'T MEAN THIS PICTURE. I MEAN YOU'RE ABOUT TO LIVE THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR LIFE ALL OVER. I ONLY HOPE I'M STILL AROUND TO SEE IF YOU CAN IMPROVE ON THE FIRST PERFORMANCE. YOU KNOW, THIS COULD BE A GREAT COMEBACK FOR YOU-- FOR BOTH OF US. HERE'S TO YOU-- TO LEWIS. NO, NOT TO ME. TO HER. WITHOUT HER COURAGE, BEAUTY, AND TALENT, WE'D BE NOWHERE. YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. TO LYLAH. LYLAH? ELSA! POWDER ROOM. SHE'LL BE BACK. YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THAT, HUH? YOU'RE POSITIVE. IT SIMPLY HASN'T OCCURRED TO YOU SHE MAY BE HURT, THAT SHE MAY THINK SHE'S ENTITLED TO SOME OF THE APPLAUSE. I THOUGHT I WARNED YOU ABOUT MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES ALL OVER AGAIN! LYLAH WALKED OUT. THIS GIRL COULD, TOO. NOW FOR ONCE, JUST LISTEN TO ME. GO AFTER HER! WITHOUT HER, YOU'RE AS DEAD AS GOLDWATER. NOW GO AHEAD! COME ON! ALRIGHT. IF YOU'RE TOO PIGHEADED TO GO AND APOLOGIZE, I WILL. ALRIGHT. I'LL GO AND DO MY CONTRITE ACT. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THAT LOOKS LIKE GAME, SET, AND MATCH. [MOLLY LAUGHS] ELSA? ELSA! ELSA! ELSA? WELL, WHERE IS SHE? THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID BEFORE. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? AFTER THE WEDDING, YOU CAME SEARCHING FOR LYLAH, THE SAME LOOK ON YOUR FACE. [ROSSELLA CHUCKLES] FOR GOD'S SAKE, WHY DON'T YOU SAVE YOUR TRIPS FOR THE WEEKEND? NOW, WHERE IS SHE? DO YOU REMEMBER ROME BEFORE LYLAH WHEN I WAS ACTING WITH THAT SHABBY LITTLE COMPANY? I TOLD YOU THEN-- SOMETIMES EVEN A DOG NEEDS TO HEAR ITS NAME CALLED. I WANT TO KNOW-- WHERE IS SHE? CONCENTRATE. SHE... SHE'S DEAD. DON'T YOU KNOW THAT? SHE CAME HERE. SHE BEGGED ME FOR A SHOT. ANYTHING. ANYTHING TO HELP. I DIDN'T GIVE HER ANY, BUT I COULD TELL WHEN SHE CAME BACK, WHEN I SAW HER ON THE STAIRS, THAT SHE HAD GOT SOME FROM SOMEWHERE. NOT LYLAH, YOU IDIOT! I'M TALKING ABOUT-- Rossella: ELSA, LYLAH-- WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? SHE'S DESERTING YOU. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] LET HER GO. PLEASE, LET HER GO. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? [SPEAKING ITALIAN] NO. NO, LEWIS. WE CAN DO WITHOUT HER. [ROSSELLA SPEAKING ITALIAN] WE BOTH CAN. ELSA? PLEASE, LET HER GO. YOU DON'T WANT HER. YOU DON'T NEED HER. I CAN GIVE YOU ANYTHING YOU WANT. DON'T TELL ME YOUR TASTE'S CHANGED AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. SHE'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE. LEWIS, BELIEVE ME, I WASN'T THAT WAY WHEN YOU WERE STILL INTERESTED. I CAN STILL HELP YOU. I KNOW WHAT YOU LIKE. FOR GOD'S SAKE! YOU'RE BEHAVING LIKE A LADY WRESTLER IN DRAG. LYLAH COULD NEVER SATISFY YOU LIKE I DID. ELSA? Rossella: LEWIS, I'M STILL A WOMAN. Lewis: ELSA! I AM. I AM! PLEASE, TOUCH ME. I'LL SHOW YOU. JUST TOUCH ME. YOU DON'T NEED ME. GO AND PLAY WITH SOME OF YOUR LITTLE TOYS. NO. NO, LEWIS, PLEASE. PLEASE. PLEASE HOLD ME. SPLENDID, MR. ZARKAN. WHAT FORCE! WHAT PERFECT TIMING! YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN ACTOR. Lewis: I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU. Elsa: HAVE YOU? WHAT, TO SAY GOODBYE? TO APOLOGIZE. TRY APOLOGIZING TO ROSSELLA. YOU'VE A MOMENT TO LISTEN TO AN APOLOGY, HAVEN'T YOU? NO, I HAVEN'T. I'VE A CAR WAITING. MR. SHEEAN? I'M AFRAID NOT. I SENT HIM HOME. YOU DID WHAT? I ASKED HIM TO LEAVE. THAT'S SIMPLE ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND, ISN'T IT? YOU'LL FIND IT LOCKED. Lewis: DON'T POUT. IT'S ATTRACTIVE, BUT IT AGES YOU... YOU'LL FIND. WELL? OH, DO COME ON. MR. ZARKAN? IF YOU'RE GONNA KEEP ME HERE LOCKED OUT OF MY ROOM, I'LL JUST HAVE TO FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO SLEEP, WON'T I? SHOULD BE QUITE AN EXPERIENCE. I'VE NEVER SLEPT IN A MAUSOLEUM BEFORE. YOU'RE NOT TO GO IN THERE, YOU HEAR? WHY? IS SHE STILL IN HERE? IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING-- KEEPING HER IN A LITTLE CONTAINER? INSTANT LYLAH? ELSA, PLEASE, AS A FAVOR. I ASK YOU NOT TO. "PLEASE"? WELL, THAT'S A NEW WORD IN YOUR VOCABULARY--"PLEASE." "PLEASE." NO, LEWIS. NO. LEWIS, IF YOU HURT THIS GIRL, I WILL PUNISH YOU. THIS TIME, I WILL REALLY PUNISH YOU. DO YOU HEAR ME? THIS TIME, I WILL REALLY PUNISH YOU. DON'T YOU... I SWEAR IT! I'LL KILL YOU IF I HAVE TO. [ROSSELLA SPEAKING ITALIAN] IT'S JUST AS I FOUND IT... OUR WEDDING DAY. WHY? WHY? I LOOKED EVERYWHERE FOR HER, AND SUDDENLY, FROM DOWNSTAIRS, I HEARD HER CRYING OUT, SCREAMING. I RAN TO SEE. IT WAS... WILD, HYSTERICAL. IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE SCREAMS FROM HER. THEN I LOOKED DOWN. WHAT I SAW, I COULDN'T COMPREHEND. COULDN'T MAKE IT OUT. AND THEN SUDDENLY I REALIZED THAT THE SCREAMS WERE LAUGHTER. [LAUGHTER] COME ON. [DISTORTED VOICES] Lylah: NO, NOT NOW. YES, RIGHT NOW! YOU'RE NOT THE ONE I MARRIED! NOT HERE. NOT NOW. YES, RIGHT NOW! I WANT YOU RIGHT NOW. Lylah: NO, BUT THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE. THEN INVITE THEM ALL! HELLO, LEWIS. HO HO HO. WHY, LEWIS, DARLING! HOW'S THE BRIDEGROOM, HUH? GET OUT! OH, THE POOR THING IS COLD! I THINK I KNOW OF A WARM BED. I SUPPOSE IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT CROWDED. GET HIM OUT OF HERE! LOOK AT IT. IT'S COMMUNITY PROPERTY. Lewis: GET OUT! Lewis, voice-over: THEN SHE TURNED ON ME. SHE WAS HYSTERICAL. SAID A LOT OF THINGS SHE DIDN'T MEAN, COULDN'T HAVE MEANT. I WAS ANGRY. I ANSWERED HER. AND THEN SUDDENLY SHE WAS SORRY, CAME INTO MY ARMS AND BEGGED ME TO FORGIVE HER. HE CAME AT ME WITH A KNIFE... AND SHE LAUGHED. THE BOY WAS SAVAGE, AND WE FOUGHT. [DISTORTED SCREAM] Lewis: THE SOUND OF HIS BODY FALLING, AND ROSSELLA SCREAMED. KEEP YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF ME! Lewis: I LOOKED. IT WAS A GIRL. I TRIED TO STOP HER. I TOLD HER NOT TO LOOK DOWN. [SHOUTS IN ITALIAN] YOU'VE HEARD THE REST. BARNEY SHEEAN PERSUADED OUR CITY FATHERS TO KEEP IT OUT OF THE PAPERS, AT LEAST ABOUT IT BEING A GIRL THAT CAUSED HER FALL FROM THE STEPS. ROSSELLA AND I WERE THE ONLY ONES THAT KNEW THE REAL TRUTH. LYLAH WAS DEAD. LIES DIDN'T MATTER. SHE DESERVED IT. MAYBE. TRIED TO DESTROY BOTH OF US. I MUST HAVE COME UP THESE STEPS HERE. AT LEAST, I REMEMBER CROSSING THE LANDING, AND I FOUND MYSELF IN THE ROOM. I KNEW THAT I HAD TO SEND FOR THE POLICE. SHE HAD DRIVEN ME ALMOST BEYOND ENDURANCE. THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I LOATHED HER. THEN, LATER... I BEGAN TO THINK... PERHAPS SOME OF IT WAS MY FAULT. SHE... SHE WAS... THE MOST REMARKABLE WOMAN I'VE EVER KNOWN. SO WHAT DO YOU DO-- YOU SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE TRYING TO FIND HER AGAIN. YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T. WHO'LL EXPLAIN? AT LEAST TO FIND OUT WHAT WENT WRONG. DID SHE LOVE ME? DID SHE HATE ME? WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE NOW? I DON'T HATE YOU. [ELSA MOANING] YOU JUST MADE A BIG MISTAKE, HAVEN'T YOU? OH, REALLY? YOU SAID YOU NEVER SLEPT WITH YOUR LEADING LADIES UNTIL THE FINAL DAY OF SHOOTING. DID I? IF I REPLACE YOU, IT WILL BE. I'M BETTER ON THE SET. LET'S SEE HOW YOU PERFORM ON THE SET. YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE THAT ALL WOMEN ARE LIKE THAT. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT WOMEN. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ACTRESSES. HMM. SEE IF YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE, HMM? NOT BAD FOR A HOME AWAY FROM HOME, IS IT? IS THAT-- THERE YOU ARE. THAT'S IT. WHY, IT'S JUST LIKE-- IT'S YOUR PLACE. Man: ALRIGHT. HIT SWITCH 8. OH, IT'S INCREDIBLE! OH, WOW! THERE YOU ARE. WOW! WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT? Man: ALRIGHT. NOW, HIT THIS SENIORS HERE. IT'S IDENTICAL. EXCEPT THAT THIS ONE IS OF YOU. REALLY? Man: EXCUSE ME, MR. ZARKAN. WE CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER TO CHOOSE ANOTHER OF THESE PICTURES FOR THE CONTEST. OH, PAUL, I'M SORRY. VERY GOOD SELECTION. Paul: WE SHOT SOME OF THESE THE OTHER DAY. SOME ARE 20 YEARS OLD. I QUITE LIKE THAT ONE. DO YOU LIKE IT? UH, WHAT ABOUT THAT ONE? AND THE ONE YOU'VE CHOSEN? PREPRODUCTION CAMPAIGN. TEASER CONTEST. WHICH ONE IS THE REAL LYLAH CLARE? THAT'S SIMPLE. THAT'S ME. ELSA CAMPBELL. HUH! WE TOOK THAT 22 YEARS AGO. Man: RIGHT ON HER, CHARLIE. ALRIGHT. ARE WE ROLLING? ALRIGHT, MISS CAMPBELL. NOW, IT'S A SIMPLE ACTION. LET'S TRY IT AGAIN. NOW, I SAID TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF THE WHEEL. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE STEERING. WE'LL DO IT UP HERE. RIGHT, KEEP THEM ROLLING. RIGHT, LET'S START AGAIN. NOW, TAKE YOUR HAND OFF THE WHEEL. SHOW ME THE CIGARETTE. SLOWLY! NOW THE LIGHTER. PUT THE LIGHTER BACK. TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF THE WHEEL! DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE STEERING. CUT! OH, CUT IT! I'M LOSING MY VOICE. WHAT'S THE TIME? Woman: COFFEE TIME. GO AHEAD WITH THE TRUCK, AND WE'LL HAVE COFFEE. YOUR FRIEND THE DIRECTOR, IF HE'S SUCH A GENIUS, WHY HE IS TAKING SO LONG WITH THE SHOTS? BECKY, IT'S NOT EASY. Man: HEY, WATCH OUT! Man: PULL OFF THE ROAD! Peter: ALRIGHT. 10 MINUTES, EVERYBODY. BARRY, LOAD THE V.N.C. PHIL, GET ME A SANDWICH. CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING, MR. ZARKAN? YES. COKE. ANYTHING WRONG? EVERYTHING. YOU MIGHT TAKE THE BLOODY TOP OFF IT! WHAT'LL YOU HAVE, MISS CAMPBELL? COFFEE. IT'S A PERFECTLY SIMPLE ACTION. I DON'T SEE WHY YOU CAN'T FOLLOW ORDERS. IT'S NOT SIMPLE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE THINKING. WHAT AM I FEELING? OUT THERE, THE DAY I'VE BEEN MARRIED. WHY? WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO FEEL? FEEL? YOU STUPID COW! DO IS DO AS I SAY, THEN YOUR FEELING WILL BE UP ON THE SCREEN. ALL I NEED IS YOUR FACE. I DON'T WANT YOUR GOOD WILL OR YOUR UNDERSTANDING. THINK OF SOMETHING. UNCLE BART DYING OF CANCER-- THAT'S THE EXPRESSION I NEED ON YOU. I TOLD YOU NOT TO PUSH HER TOO FAR. OH, DO ME A FAVOR! IT IS POSSIBLE SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND. UNDERSTAND? UNDERSTAND WHAT? I'VE NEVER KNOWN. WHAT WAS LYLAH DOING OUT HERE AFTER THE WEDDING? IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. WHY DON'T YOU READ THE SCRIPT? IT'S NOT IN THE SCRIPT. LOTS OF OTHER THINGS I DON'T KNOW AREN'T IN THE SCRIPT, EITHER. I THOUGHT MAYBE IF YOU MADE THIS PICTURE, I'D FIND OUT. HOLDING OUT ON PEOPLE IS WRONG? WHY DON'T YOU ASK ME SOMETIME WHEN YOU'RE ALONE WHAT THE VERDICT WAS AT THE MAYO CLINIC. VERDICT? BART, WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT? IT'S NOTHING, NOTHING. YOU KNOW LEWIS AND HIS CRUMMY JOKES. NO, NO, BART. NO, I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE MAYO CLINIC-- IS SOMETHING WRONG? QUIT IT, BECKS! BECKY, IT'S NOTHING. IT WAS A JOKE. IT CAN'T BE A JOKE. YOU'RE MY GIRL, BECKS. BACK TO WORK! LET'S SEE IF MISS CAMPBELL CAN GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME. Man: LET'S MOVE IT. WE'RE LOSING LIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A GOOD PICTURE, EH, LIEBLING? WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME. WE'VE GOT TO GO, MISS CAMPBELL. Man: OKAY, OKAY. LET'S GO, EVERYBODY. COME ON, COME ON. LET'S GO. [ZARKAN'S VOICE] BRUSH. BRUSH. ONCE MORE. JUST A CLOSEUP. DON'T BRUSH YOUR HAIR LIKE A CHILD. BRUSH IT LIKE A WOMAN. BRUSH IT AS LYLAH WOULD BRUSH IT... AS LYLAH WOULD BRUSH IT. AS LYLAH... AS LYLAH... AS LYLAH... AS LYLAH... PLEASE, LEWIS. NO MORE. I'M SO TIRED. PLEASE, LEWIS. ELSA, ARE YOU ALRIGHT? COME, TESORO, COME. BACK TO BED. COME. CLOSEUPS. HE SAID, "ONCE MORE FOR LEWIS." YOU ARE ASLEEP, AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT. WORK IS ALL OVER, DEAR, TILL TOMORROW. NO, BUT I HAVE TO. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] SLEEP. SINCE LEWIS BOUGHT FOR YOU THIS STUFF... WHAT DID LEWIS SAY? I'VE GOT TO. I'VE GOT TO DO THEM. TAKE THIS. IT WILL KEEP YOU ASLEEP. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] SLEEP. STAY ASLEEP. THIS IS WHAT YOU LIKE, ISN'T IT? UMM. LYLAH USED TO LIKE IT, TOO. IT WOULD MAKE HER FORGET--RELAX. AND FINALLY... ELSA, IF YOU CAN'T STAND IT ANY LONGER, COME TO ROSSELLA. SHE WILL HELP YOU TO GET AWAY. LYLAH. I LOVE YOU. I ALWAYS LOVED YOU. LYLAH... GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE! WARDROBE, MAKEUP, EVERYBODY-- YOU'VE BEEN THERE FOR HOURS. Peter: ALRIGHT. PLACES, EVERYBODY. CLEAR THE CAMERA. Zarkan: THE KNIFE! GIVE HER THE KNIFE! TAKE IT UP THERE, MAN. ZARKAN, THE ACTOR-- YOU'LL WAIT FOR THE CUE, RIGHT? NOW, MISS CAMPBELL, THE LAST SHOT IN THE PICTURE, THE VERY LAST SHOT, AND YOU'VE MADE US DO IT HOW MANY TIMES? LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME. ALRIGHT. LET'S GO. ALRIGHT. HERE WE GO. ROLL IT, PLEASE. WELL, HERE WE GO, DICK. TAKE 33. SPEED. SCENE 301, TAKE 33. ACTION! Elsa: I'M SORRY. IT SLIPPED FROM MY HAND. SHALL I CUT THE CAMERAS? NO, KEEP THEM GOING. ALRIGHT. PICK UP THE KNIFE, AND LET'S START AGAIN. ACTION! CUT! CUT! DAMN IT ALL! Elsa: I CAN'T! Man: IMAGINE! 33 TAKES. EXCUSE ME. NOW, LOOK. DOES THAT HURT ME? DOES THAT HURT YOU? IT'S A PROP. IT'S A FAKE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? WE'RE GOING ON MEAL PENALTY. DAMN THE MEAL PENALTY! TAKE 5. COME ON. ALRIGHT, EVERYBODY. YOU HEARD THE MAN. 5 MINUTES. COFFEE WITH VODKA. Man: CHECK THE TRIM ON THAT ROOM. LOOK, SHE'S EXHAUSTED. LET'S WAIT-- SHE'S JUST TIRED. WOULD YOU LIKE SOME COFFEE, ELSA? MAYBE YOU'D LIKE SOMETHING TO EAT, HUH? ACTORS! -THEY'RE ALL ALIKE. -THEY'RE IMPOSSIBLE! WHAT IS IT THIS TIME, MOTIVATION? YOU JUST CAN'T FEEL IT, IS THAT IT? 33 TAKES! I HAVE ENOUGH FILM. I COULD PATCH IT TOGETHER, BUT IN A KEY SITUATION LIKE THIS, IT'S JUST NOT BELIEVABLE UNLESS IT'S ALL IN A SINGLE TAKE. CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME. FOR WEEKS, YOU PLAY A ROLE DAMN NEAR PERFECTLY, AND SUDDENLY YOU HIT SOMETHING THAT STOPS YOU DEAD. WHY? WHY? I DON'T KNOW WHY. ELSA... YOU MAY BE RIGHT. YOU COULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE YOU KNEW IT WASN'T THE BOY SHE WANTED TO MURDER. IT WAS ME. YOU COULDN'T PLAY IT BECAUSE IT WAS FALSE... PHONY. IT HAS TO BE DIFFERENT. THE WHOLE THING. CLEVER GIRL. YOU'RE A CLEVER GIRL. MR. SHEEAN! MARK PETER SHEEAN, WRAP IT UP! BREAK OUT THE CHAMPAGNE. START THE PARTY. THE PICTURE'S OVER. OKAY, YOU HEARD THE MAN. THERE'S THE BAR. [CHEERING] [INDISTINCT TALKING] [SPEAKING GERMAN] NOW, THE BEST SHOT IN THE PICTURE. I COULD SWEAR THAT'S LYLAH. IT'S AMAZING. IT'S JUST AMAZING. NOW, WATCH CAREFULLY. IT'S JUST SO WONDERFUL, MISS. YOU'RE MARVELOUS. Bart: IT TOOK TWO WEEKS TO FIND THAT OLD CAR. WE DISSOLVE...HERE. HOUSE LIGHTS! WHERE'S THE REST OF IT? WHERE'S THE BOY? WE DON'T NEED HIM, DO WE, MIKE? DON'T NEED THE BOY? SEE YOU DOWNSTAIRS. ALRIGHT. I'LL BE DOWN. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU DON'T NEED THE BOY? HE'S OUR WHOLE ENDING. NOT ANYMORE, HE ISN'T. NOW, LISTEN TO ME. YOU KNOW THAT SCENE ON THE STAIRS THAT ELSA COULDN'T PULL OFF? MAYBE SHE WAS RIGHT. ANYHOW, HER INABILITY TO PLAY IT GAVE ME A WHOLE NEW CONCEPTION FOR THE ENDING. WE START SHOOTING TOMORROW. WHAT ABOUT YOUR 6-MONTH DEADLINE? WE HAVE A DAY IN HAND. BARNEY ISN'T GOING TO STAND FOR THAT. HOW COULD HE STOP ME? THE SET'S ALREADY BUILT, RIGGED, AND DRESSED. WHAT IS THIS, SOME KIND OF AN INSPIRATION? YES! IN THAT SECTION YOU JUST SEE, LYLAH WAS REHEARSING FOR THE LOVE THAT FLAMED, RIGHT? BUT SHE DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT. SHE'S AFRAID. SHE'S AFRAID OF WHAT'S TO BE. SHE'LL DO ANYTHING, ANYTHING IN THE WORLD NOT TO HAVE TO PLAY IT. SHE MARRIES, TALKS OF RETIREMENT, HAVING A BABY-- BUT SHE'S TORN, AND IT'S THE THOUGHT OF RETIREMENT THAT DRIVES HER UP THE WALL. THAT'S WHAT'S EATING HER UP WHEN SHE'S DRIVING ALONG THE COAST HIGHWAY. NOW SHE HAS TO MAKE UP HER MIND. BY THE TIME SHE REACHES THE GATE, SHE'S DECIDED. SHE'S AN ARTIST, IT'S BACK TO WORK, BACK TO REHEARSAL, BACK TO THE TRAPEZE. TRAPEZE? BUT LYLAH WAS AFRAID OF HEIGHTS. THAT'S HOW SHE FELL ON THE STAIRS! IS THAT WHY SHE FELL? EXACTLY, BART! SHE FACES THE IMPOSSIBLE, TRIES, FAILS, AND THE GREAT STAR DIES IN HARNESS. HOW'S THAT? I THINK THAT'S THE MOST VULGAR AND RIDICULOUS IDEA I'VE EVER HEARD FROM YOU. OH, REALLY? YEAH. OH, REALLY. I BET IF ANYBODY ELSE HAD SUGGESTED THAT AS THE ENDING FOR A FILM, YOU WOULD HAVE DISMISSED IT AS BENEATH CONTEMPT. OH, GOOD GOD, LEWIS! THAT IDEA IS SO CORNY EVEN BARNEY SHEEAN WOULD THINK IT WAS IN BAD TASTE. YOU THINK SO, DO YOU? YOU SPEND 30 YEARS PEDDLING THIRD-RATE GARBAGE THAT YOU GET 10% OF, AND NOW SUDDENLY BY SOME HOLY DISPENSATION, YOU'RE A CRITIC. YOU'RE AN ARBITER OF GOOD TASTE, ARE YOU? STOP INDULGING YOURSELF. THE REAL POINT IS, IT IS JUST NOT TRUE. AND THAT SCENE ON THE STAIRS, IS THAT TRUE? THE PUBLIC KNOWS HOW SHE DIED! THE PUBLIC THINKS IT KNOWS. ASK ANYBODY 10 YEARS FROM NOW HOW LYLAH DIED, THEY'LL SAY, REHEARSING FOR A CIRCUS PICTURE. WE MAKE THE LEGEND. THE LEGEND BECOMES TRUTH. IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR CHURCHILL, ALBERT SCHWEITZER AND HITLER, IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU AND MORE THAN GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE PUBLIC. OH! NOT ONLY AM I THE PRODUCER, BUT ELSA IS ALSO MY CLIENT. I REFUSE TO LET HER PERFORM. WE'LL STAY WITH THE ENDING WE HAVE. WELL, I'M SORRY, BUT I HAVE A PIECE OF BAD NEWS FOR YOU. THAT PARTICULAR PIECE OF NEGATIVE CAUGHT FIRE AND BURNED. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT-- NOT FOR A SECOND. YOU'RE A LIAR. WITHOUT AN ENDING, YOU HAVE NO PICTURE. OH, BOY, OH, BOY, OH, BOY, OH, BOY! AND WITHOUT AN ACTRESS, YOU'VE GOT NO PICTURE. PERHAPS THE DIRECTOR SHOULD TRY TALKING TO THE STAR. Rossella: THIS MAY BE THE TIME TO PROPOSE. IT WAS THE LAST TIME. WE WERE LOOKING FOR YOU. I'M HERE WAITING. DO YOU SUPPOSE IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE IN LOVE? LOVE. L-O-V-E. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT, HMM? NOTHING. YOU ARE, TOO. I ASSURE YOU MY MIND IS A TOTAL BLANK. WANT TO KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT? MM-HMM. WE DO LOVE EACH OTHER, DON'T WE? HMM? I WAS THINKING, WELL, NOW THAT THE PICTURE'S FINISHED-- I MEAN, NEARLY FINISHED-- WE'LL GO AWAY SOMEWHERE, JUST THE TWO OF US. IT WOULD BE NICE UP IN THE MOUNTAINS, WOULDN'T IT? IT'S NOT WHAT I REALLY WANT, EITHER. I WANT YOUR CHILD. FOR GOD'S SAKE! STOP TALKING LIKE AN IDIOT! I'VE JUST STARTED YOUR CAREER. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AN ACTRESS, NOT A BLOODY BABY FACTORY! WHAT'S WRONG? WHAT HAVE I DONE? WE'VE JUST BEEN TO BED TOGETHER. IT'S PERFECTLY NORMAL FOR CONSENTING ADULTS. IT'S DONE EVERY DAY. YES. FOR SOME PEOPLE, IT'S A WAY OF SHOWING THEIR LOVE. I...GUESS I'VE BEEN NAIVE TO THINK THAT-- I GUESS YOU HAVE. THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO? WHY DID YOU LET ME BELIEVE? BELIEVE WHAT? THAT YOU LOVED ME. MY GOD! SOMEBODY OUGHT TO PUT YOUR DIALOGUE TO MUSIC. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO BE IN LOVE WITH YOU? WHO ARE YOU? I'M SOMEBODY THAT YOU WANTED TO MAKE LOVE TO. SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK THAT HAD A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RESPONSIBILITY. OH, WOULD THEY? YOU DON'T OWN ME. YOU DON'T CONTROL ME. ON THE CONTRARY. BE ON THE SET AT 9:00 TODAY AND DO AS I SAY, BECAUSE YOU'RE AN ILLUSION. WITHOUT ME, YOU DON'T EXIST. YOU'RE NOTHING! DO YOU UNDERSTAND? NOTHING! HA HA HA! [SOBBING] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] HERE'S WHERE YOU GET OUT. IS HE DRUNK? UH-UH. LATER, YOU WILL WANT ME AGAIN. [SIGHS] SUIT YOURSELF. ENRICO? SIGNOR ZARKAN, PREGO. LEWIS, THIS IS LYLAH. YOU SAW OUR BEDROOM. WELL, THAT'S MY ANSWER. I DECIDED TO COME BACK TO WORK. I'M AT THE STUDIO. YOU BETTER GET DOWN HERE--FAST! HA HA HA! Paul: HA HA HA! NO, YOU MUST BE KIDDING. I DON'T THINK IT'S SO FUNNY. THAT'S HOW I GOT INTO PICTURES. I WAS HER GARDENER. NOW, IF SHE TAKES A LIKING TO ME... ANYWAY, ABOUT TWO WEEKS LATER, I'D JUST STARTED TO WORK IN THE CUTTING ROOM-- I'M AFRAID WE GOT TROUBLE. I CAN SEE THAT BY ALL THE HAPPY, SMILING FACES. I TAKE IT MISS CAMPBELL'S NOT IN A COOPERATIVE MOOD. SHE WON'T COME OUT OF HER DRESSING ROOM. WE'LL HAVE TO BE VERY KIND TO HER, WON'T WE? I GUESS SO, BUT... TWO V.N.C.s OVER THERE, THERE'S AN AIRFLEX UP THERE, AND-- LEWIS, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU. I'M SORRY. IT DIDN'T TAKE HIM LONG TO CHANGE, DID IT? ONE PRODUCER. LEWIS! LEWIS! [DRUMROLL] SHUT UP! SAM, SEE THAT ALL THOSE CAMERAS HAVE FULL MAGAZINES ON THEM, WILL YOU? Sam: YEAH. WAIT A MINUTE! LOOK, LEWIS, ELSA'S GOT THAT ITALIAN GARDENER OF YOURS IN THERE-- THAT PAOLO OR WHATEVER HIS NAME IS. SHE CAN HAVE THE UNITED STATES MARINE BAND IN THERE AS LONG AS SHE REPORTS FOR WORK. BUT I DON'T THINK SHE'S IN A STATE TO WORK. DON'T BE STAR-STRUCK. SHE'S GOT ENERGY FOR PAOLO, SHE'S GOT ENERGY TO WORK. I'M TALKING ABOUT HER STATE OF MIND. NOW, LOOK, COULDN'T YOU WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW? YOU'LL DESTROY THIS GIRL. IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO? THAT DISEASE MUST HAVE ADDLED YOUR BRAIN. WANT TO WAIT TILL TOMORROW? THERE'S BARNEY. TELL HIM YOURSELF. WHY, YOU BASTARD! HELLO, BARNEY. YEAH? LISTEN, ZARKAN, IF YOU FEEL LIKE THROWING END-OF-THE-PICTURE PARTIES WHEN YOU'RE STILL HALFWAY THROUGH SHOOTING-- I'LL BE FINISHED TODAY. I MEAN IT. AND I MEANT WHAT I SAID. YOU'VE GOT UNTIL MIDNIGHT. IF YOU'RE NOT OUT OF HERE BY THEN, I'M GOING TO HAVE YOU THROWN OUT--PERMANENTLY! AND THAT MEANS YOU DON'T GET TO CUT THE PICTURE, EITHER. IF YOU BUTCHER THIS PICTURE... I KNOW, I KNOW. YOU'LL NEVER SPEAK TO ME AGAIN. OH, COME ON! PETER, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU! [ELSA LAUGHING] [GERMAN ACCENT] Elsa: WHO IS IT? ZARKAN. COME ON, OPEN UP. HA! I'LL OPEN IT... WHEN I'M GOOD AND READY. ELSA? ELSA? WHO'S THAT? ANOTHER OF YOUR GIRLS? THIS IS LYLAH. DO YOU HEAR ME, LEWIS? THIS IS LYLAH. COME ON, OPEN UP. PAOLO, DO YOU THINK YOU COULD BE PERSUADED TO RESUME YOUR HORTICULTURAL ACTIVITIES NOW? HA HA HA HA! WHY, LEWIS, THAT'S RATHER FUNNY. YOU WANT I SHOULD GO NOW? NEVER MIND WHAT MISS CAMPBELL WANTS. JUST GET OUT. I DO MIND WHAT ELSA WANTS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME. LET HER SPEAK FOR HERSELF. I THINK UNCLE LEWIS IS GETTING CROSS. NEVER MIND, TESORO. WE CAN CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATION LATER, HMM? OKAY. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] HUH! [SPEAKING ITALIAN] YOU'RE DUE ON THE SET NOW. BE THERE IN 5 MINUTES. LEWIS! WHAT? WHAT MAKES YOU THINK HAT I HAVE ANY INTENTION OF WORKING TODAY? I TOLD YOU LONG AGO I'D RATHER QUIT THIS STUPID BUSINESS THAN MAKE YOUR MOVIE. WHO'S WRITING YOUR LINES NOW, ROSSELLA? HA HA HA! SO YOU PRETENDED TO OFFER ME THE ONE THING I REALLY WANTED-- YOURSELF. HA! COME, GET UP. [SHOUTS IN GERMAN] KEEP YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF ME! YES, MR. ZARKAN. YOU'LL GET YOUR PICTURE FINISHED. YOU OFFERED TO MAKE THE SUPREME SACRIFICE. YOU OFFERED TO MARRY ME. BUT YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU DID, WHEN I SAID I WAS GOING TO HAVE YOUR BABY, "GET RID OF IT," YOU SAID. "GET RID OF IT!" THE ONE THING I WANTED, THE ONE THING YOU PROMISED ME, THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY MATTERED-- "GET RID OF IT!" BUT YOU TRIED TO MAKE A MONSTER OUT OF ME. YOU INVENTED THE CHILD SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORK. DID I, LEWIS? WHY DON'T YOU ASK DR. WILLIAMS? HAS IT EVER OCCURRED TO YOU TO DO THAT? HAS IT? NO, YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE YOU MIGHT JUST LEARN THE TRUTH, AND THAT WOULD KEEP YOU FROM MAKING YOUR MASTERPIECE. SUPPOSE I WAS DOING JUST THAT? HA HA HA! YOUR MASTERPIECE! HA HA HA HA! THAT'S A JOKE! I WOULDN'T ACCEPT THE GREATEST CREATION EVER CONCEIVED IF IT MEANT HAVING TO ACCEPT YOUR ROTTEN SELFISHNESS. YOU ARE SO IN LOVE WITH YOURSELF, YOU'RE-- YOU'RE BEGINNING TO STINK! YOU'RE LIKE ANY VULGAR LITTLE SHOPGIRL. YOU'D SOONER GAPE AT SOME ROMANTIC PICTURE BOOK THAN TRY AND DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR LIFE. IS THAT IT? BUT I'M WHAT YOU MADE ME, LEWIS. LOOK. LOOK! LOOK! YOU'RE GOD. I'M CREATED IN YOUR IMAGE. YOU'VE TAKEN ON A LIFE OF YOUR OWN, HAVEN'T YOU? YOU DON'T NEED ME. A DIRECTOR'S JUST SOMEONE TO KEEP THE TECHNICIANS HAPPY. AND YOU CAN PICK UP A BUM IN THE STREET ANYWHERE, CAN'T YOU? YOU ARE RIGHT. RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT! YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. LYLAH, YOU'RE WRONG. WITHOUT A DIRECTOR, YOU'RE JUST A VULGAR LITTLE EXHIBITIONIST. YOU HAVEN'T THE REMOTEST IDEA WHAT YOU'RE DOING. YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT, DON'T YOU, LITTLE MAN? ALRIGHT, LITTLE MAN... I'LL SHOW YOU. WE'LL SEE WHO'S NUMBER ONE. LET'S DO THAT, SHALL WE? NOW YOU GET YOUR ASS OUT THERE AND TELL 'EM LYLAH'S COMING SOON AS SHE GETS HER HARNESS ON. AND WHEN SHE WHISTLES, THEY SQUAT! ALL OF THEM! EVERY DAMN LAST ONE! YOU, TOO, BARNEY! HEAR ME, BARNEY? SQUAT AND WAIT. HA! JUST WAIT FOR LYLAH! HA HA HA! HA HA HA HA! WARDROBE! HOW COULD SHE HAVE KNOWN ABOUT DR. WILLIAMS? LYLAH NEVER TOLD ANYONE BUT US. YOU DO VERY WELL WITHOUT KEYHOLES, DON'T YOU? Elsa: WARDROBE! IT'S US. Elsa: COME IN. [LAUGHING] Man: HERE SHE COMES! [ACCORDION PLAYING] MY APOLOGIES FOR KEEPING YOU WAITING, BOYS. LET'S GO. Man: WHERE'S MISS CAMPBELL'S DOUBLE? Man: HEY, YOU LOOK GREAT, ELSA! WHAT HAPPENS HERE IS, YOU GO UP TO THE PLATFORM-- SORRY, DARLING. WE DON'T NEED YOU TODAY. SEE SHE GETS PAID. ELSA, SHE'S GOT TO GO UP-- I SAID, GET HER OUT. THERE WON'T BE A CUT. IT'S ALL TIED INTO ONE PERSON. ONE SHOT, JUST ME. SO KEEP YOUR CAMERAS ROLLING, MR. ZARKAN. I'M ON MY MARK. LET'S GO! YOU THINK I ENJOY THIS? IT'S COLD AS HELL OUT HERE. WHENEVER YOU ARE READY, MISS CAMPBELL, WE ARE. Man: OKAY, FELLOWS. LIGHT THEM ALL, AND HIT THEM DOWN ON MISS CAMPBELL. Second man: WE ZOOM THAT HIGH AIRFLEX IN... DARLING, PLEASE, DON'T GO UP. NO, NOT NOW. FOR ME. DON'T WORRY, ROSSELLA. I'M ONLY GOING TO FINALLY PUT LEWIS IN HIS PLACE. Man: ALRIGHT, TRAPEZE TEAM, GET READY. NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS DOWN HERE, NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE SAYS, DON'T LOOK DOWN. REMEMBER, DON'T LOOK DOWN. Zarkan: ROSSELLA, YOU'RE IN THE SHOT. COME ON, GET OUT. Man: COME ON, LET'S GO. COME ON. LEWIS, WHAT SHE SAID IN THE DRESSING ROOM, WHAT LYLAH SAID BEFORE, ALL OF IT-- LEWIS, YOU LOVE THIS GIRL. YOU HAVE ALL ALONG. OPEN YOUR EYES. YOU LOVE HER... THE SAME WAY YOU LOVED LYLAH. DON'T DO IT OVER AGAIN. Elsa: WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR? ALRIGHT. ROLL 'EM. YOU'RE A CUCKOLD. SO WAS I. SHE BETRAYED YOU, TOO. LOVE'S OLD SWEET SONG. LEWIS, IF SHE REALLY GETS HURT... Man: SCENE 302, TAKE ONE. LEWIS, IF SHE SHOULD-- Elsa: LET'S GO, LEWIS. ACTION! YOU GOT TO DO SOMETHING. I GOT TO DO NOTHING. ALRIGHT. JUST GIVE HER 5 MORE MINUTES. LOOK, IF ANYTHING HAPPENS, I'LL PAY, I PROMISE. IF ANY--SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN, ALRIGHT. Man: QUIET! HE'S RIGHT. SHUT UP. JUST SHUT UP, THAT'S ALL. MR. ZARKAN? MR. ZARKAN? Zarkan: MISS CAMPBELL? NO ONE STOPS UNTIL I SAY "CUT." JUST KEEP YOUR CAMERAS ROLLING, ALRIGHT? LIKE THEY SAY, YOU ARE THE BOSS. HA HA HA HA! ALRIGHT, LEWIS. WE WILL SEE IF I'M AN ILLUSION. [DRUMROLL] OKAY. Man: OH HO. Woman: GOOD GIRL. THAT'S THE WAY. GOOD GIRL. Elsa: HOW WAS THAT, MR. ZARKAN? SPLENDID, ONE-TAKE CAMPBELL. KEEP THEM ROLLING. DO YOU THINK YOU COULD MANAGE ANOTHER ONE-- ANOTHER GOOD ONE-- JUST FOR PROTECTION, JUST TO BE SURE? ALRIGHT, MR. ZARKAN. JUST FOR PROTECTION, JUST TO BE SURE. [DRUMROLL] Elsa: SATISFACTORY? Elsa: HURRY UP. YOU KNOW I CAN'T STAND HEIGHTS. BRAVO. BRAVO. ELSA? LYLAH? YOUR AUDIENCE IS DOWN HERE. LOOK DOWN. SMILE. WAVE. WELL? LOOK DOWN! LOOK DOWN HERE! YOU KNOW SHE CAN'T LOOK DOWN. [ECHO FROM PAST] LOOK DOWN! LOOK DOWN HERE! Lylah: LET GO! YOU NEVER REALLY LOVED ME. LOOK DOWN. LOOK DOWN. LOOK AT YOUR FRIEND. [WOMAN WHISPERING "LOOK DOWN"] YOU THOUGHT YOU'D USE HER TO HUMILIATE ME, DIDN'T YOU? BUT YOUR DIRTY LITTLE JOB WENT WRONG. NOW SHE'S DEAD. LOOK DOWN. THERE'S NO USE BEING AFRAID. IT'S NO GOOD BEING SORRY NOW. THAT'S BLOOD DOWN THERE. DO YOU SEE THAT? THAT'S BLOOD! LOOK DOWN HERE! Rossella: NO! [ECHO FROM PAST] LOOK DOWN THERE! HER NECK! Zarkan: GET BACK. Rossella: BUT SHE'S HURT. Zarkan: KEEP BACK, ALL OF YOU! OUT OF THE WAY! OUT OF THE WAY! GET A DOCTOR! ALRIGHT, BACK! GET OUT OF THERE! TAKE IT FORWARD! Lewis: PUT THE FOLLOW SPOT ON HER. FOLLOW SPOT! IN--MOVE IN! GET THE FOLLOW SPOT DOWN ON HER! NOW, DOWN HERE! IN! MOVE IN CLOSER! CLOSER. ZARKAN THE ACTOR, GET IN THERE AND PLAY TO IT. TAKE YOUR GLASSES OFF, YOU DAMN FOOL. THAT'S RIGHT. NOBODY MOVE. GO ON, PLAY THE SCENE. READ THE LINES FROM THE OTHER SCENE. GO ON. WELL, GO ON, MAN. NO MATTER WHAT STOOD BETWEEN US, I LOVE YOU. YOU CLOWNS ARE SUPPOSED TO CRY NOW. CRY! MMM-- BUT...I LOVE YOU, LEWIS. [SIREN] [APPLAUSE] AND IN MY JUDGMENT, IT'S ONE OF THE FEW REALLY REMARKABLE, TRULY GREAT MOTION PICTURES THAT ANY OF US HAVE BEEN PRIVILEGED TO SEE. THANK YOU, FREDDY. THANK YOU. I'M SURE WE ALL WISH YOU EVERY KIND OF LUCK. WE'LL BE SPEAKING TO SOME MORE OF THE GLITTERING PERSONALITIES WHO ARE HERE TONIGHT. AND REMEMBER, WE WILL RETURN TO COVER, LIVE, THIS GLITTERING HOLLYWOOD OCCASION-- ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW HOLLYWOOD CARRIES ON IN THE FACE OF TRAGEDY. IN THIS CASE, THE UNFORTUNATE, UNTIMELY DEATH OF THAT SHINING METEOR, THE STAR OF OUR FILM, MISS ELSA CAMPBELL. BUT NOW, ANOTHER IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM OUR SPONSOR. IF ANY OF YOU HAVE A SPECIAL PET, AND I'M SURE YOU'LL AGREE THAT MOST OF US DO, THEN HERE IS A FABULOUS NEW PRODUCT THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT-- BARKWELL'S. BARKWELL'S VITAMIN-PACKED DOG FOOD. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. [ELSA'S VOICE ECHOING] BUT...I LOVE YOU, LEWIS. [SOBBING] [SHOUTS OF "BRAVO!"] WATCH YOUR STEP. WATCH YOUR STEP. WELL, LEWIS, YOU GOT YOUR MOVIE. BUT IT'S A PITY, ISN'T IT, THAT A SECOND-RATE ACTOR CAN CONVEY MORE LOVE THAN YOU EVER COULD? BUT FOR THAT... TV: TONIGHT'S AUDIENCE HAS HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF ENJOYING A TRULY OUTSTANDING MOTION PICTURE, TRULY. OH, MR. SHEEAN? Sheean: GOODNIGHT, FREDDY. GOODNIGHT. THANKS A LOT. AND HERE COMES HOLLYWOOD'S OWN MOLLY LUTHER. MOLLY, WHEN THIS PICTURE FIRST STARTED, YOU WROTE ABOUT SOME PROBLEMS. Luther: THERE WAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MISUNDERSTANDING WHEN THE PROJECT WAS FIRST LAUNCHED, BUT BELIEVE ME, WE ALL KNEW THAT IN ELSA CAMPBELL, LEWIS HAD FOUND A TRULY BIG TALENT. AS FAR AS LEWIS IS CONCERNED, I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN HE WAS A GREAT DIRECTOR. GOODNIGHT. THANK YOU, MOLLY. THANK YOU. THEY'RE ASKING FOR YOU OUTSIDE. MR. ZARKAN? YOU'VE GOT JUST OVER A MINUTE. TV. TV INTERVIEW? SO, BOZO I UNDERSTAND THAT THE COSTUMES FOR THIS PICTURE ARE NOTHING SHORT OF FABULOUS. THANK YOU. BUT I THINK THE CREDIT REALLY BELONGS TO ELSA CAMPBELL. THAT'S VERY GENEROUS OF YOU, COUNTESS, AND VERY TRUE, TOO. THANK YOU. I CAN'T BELIEVE EVER HAVING WORKED WITH A SWEETER, MORE TRULY HONEST AND GENUINE PERSON. LOSING ELSA HAS BEEN A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY. YES, BOZO, A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE TRAGEDY. AND NOW, HERE IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE PICTURE, LEWIS ZARKAN. WELL, MR. ZARKAN, YOU'VE HEARD THE APPLAUSE. I HAVE NO DOUBT BUT THAT THIS PICTURE IS AN UNQUALIFIED TRIUMPH. WOULD YOU SAY A FEW WORDS TO THE TELEVISION AUDIENCE? [WHISPERS] Yes. I UNDERSTAND THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT WAS TERRIBLY MOVED BY THE FINAL SCENE. DO YOU FEEL THAT THE ACTUAL TRAGIC DEATH OF MISS CAMPBELL CONTRIBUTED TO THAT IMPACT? Yes. HOW MUCH OF THE PICTURE DO YOU THINK IS FACT AND HOW MUCH FANTASY? YOU MAKE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE... AND YOUR CONSOLATION IS THAT... THE THOUGHT THAT YOU AT LEAST LEARNED SOMETHING. AND THEN YOU GATHER UP THE COURAGE TO TRY AGAIN... THEN YOU SUDDENLY REALIZE THAT ALL YOU'VE LEARNED IS HOW TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AGAIN. PERHAPS FASTER, PERHAPS DIFFERENTLY. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, MISS CAMPBELL... I REALLY THINK-- THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. ZARKAN. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. I'M AFRAID WE JUST RAN OUT OF TIME. NOW, HERE'S AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM OUR SPONSOR, THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU FOLKS TO ENJOY THIS GALA HOLLYWOOD EVENING.
