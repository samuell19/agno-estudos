You're here early. - Mr. Park? - Yes, sir. If Dongbang doesn't make the payment today, file them as bankrupt. Yes, I think we'll have to do that. Yes. Number 39, please. Hello, sir. About the payment... Well, I've told you many times already. The bank can't extend the deadline anymore. Yes, I know, but if you could just extend it one more day today... I'll be ruined. Ruined, I tell you. - President Choi went bankrupt, didn't he? - Oh, my. You know it happens all the time. Oh, my gosh! You came to work today, too? I have no choice but to work until the day before the wedding. - Then tomorrow, too? - Yes, come to the wedding in two days. - Of course. - You don't think I'd be there? I was worried you might be jealous since we were the last old maids to remain. My gosh. How were you able to date him at work without anyone finding out? You little rascal! - You're a master of dating. - She is! - A true master. - I know. What's wrong with her? Excuse me. Who's officiating the wedding? The bank president, of course. Didn't you see the invitation card? I don't look at invitation cards from close acquaintances. You fooled us totally. I didn't know Miss Oh was so sneaky. - Hey, come buy us a drink. - Let's go. - This is what I mean. - What? - Without your glasses, you're a beauty. - It's a habit. Bye. Stay healthy for 100 years! He must've been in a hurry. Bio Vita Sangsu Wine made from the finest grapes. Healthy environment It's a mild wine that can be enjoyed even by those who can't drink well! Take a long sip to get rid of your fatigue and thirst. Come on! Wait, I haven't had dinner yet. You stink of alcohol! It was late, so I shared a cab. The couple in the backseat was making out. If it weren't for you, I would have gone back downtown. Miss Lee? You must be pleased. This is your holiday bonus. - Have you planned something nice? - Yes, sir. - It's your holiday? Where are you going? - I don't know. Maybe you should follow Miss Oh on her honeymoon tomorrow? - What? What are you talking about? - Oh, sorry. Are you trying to ruin my honeymoon? You're all too much. He's getting married tomorrow but he is still working. - Just working half a day. - It's still strange. I'm sure the branch manager had something to do with it. Since one of the two old maids is getting married, he must be giving the other a holiday. That must be it. Don't rack your head over it. It's a rare holiday. You should take a rest at your hometown. Yes, that sounds good. What? That sounds good? Now you're humiliating me at work, too? - I'm sorry. I¡¯m sorry. - What is this? I said I'm sorry... - What? - Are we boxing now? Come on. Stop now. - Come on, hit him! Hit him! - Hey, hey hit him! Right, left! He missed. It's our turn now. That tickles! Left, right! Alright! One, two, body, body. Good, good! Now left, right, a little more! Oh, no! One, two, left! That's it. Good! Now a little more. Oh, come on. Now once more! That¡¯s it. Excellent! Alright! That¡¯s it. That¡¯s it. Yes, eight, nine, ten! We won, we won! That Japanese guy finally got knocked out. It was great. Look, it was a KO. - Me, too. - What? I feel knocked out. Two autumns have passed already. And another autumn is passing. Now, it's winter. It's wonderful! A wonderful victory. It feels good. We met before Mr. Gong and Miss Oh. What will you do on your holiday? Their wedding's tomorrow. I have to go to there. Of course. - It's really wonderful. - What is? I certainly enjoy living like this. - Aren't we going to have one? - One what? A wedding ceremony. Weddings are lame. Next, the bride and groom will bow to each other. - You're here. - Of course. You look beautiful! Thanks. You should get married soon, too! Let's take a picture by ourselves. - We'll get out of the way. - A picture for the two old maids! Smile! If you smile, you'll have a daughter. - Congratulations! - Thank you. Thanks. - Where are you going for the honeymoon? - I'll call you when I get back. - Goodbye! - Bye. Miss Lee! Here you are. You came, too? You're on holiday, but you came anyway. We had placed a bet on whether you would come or not. Oh, really! Why wouldn't I come? Anyway, I lost, so I'll buy lunch. - I'll decline that sort of lunch. - Are you mad? No, I'm just joking along with you. - Miss Lee? - Mr. Park. - Yes? - You have to choose one, too. - One what? - A bride! Alright, let's go. Let's go talk about your future over a drink. - Hello. - Give me a face guard, please. Alright. Here. - You must have a cold. - No. Listen, sir. This is what I'm talking about. Isn't that so? Hey, just have another drink. - In addition to that... - Yes, yes, just drink. Let's drink up. Well, that's not it. Miss, rice wine, please. - Bring some rice wine. - Alright. It's just as I said. Do exactly as I tell you. - Hey, don't eat so much. - It's good for you. Eat! - Why are you eating so much? - Hey, just eat. This is a huge problem. I can't do anything about it. Nothing at all. - What is it? - What's the matter? Premature ejaculation, I think. - It's hopeless. I'm worn out. - What's wrong? That jerk! Just because he's my boss, he thinks he can be the boss of my character, too. Then what about me? What does that make me? Do I have to mortgage even my character to these people now? These damn bastards. Oil will dry up after about 40 years of digging. When oil dries up, the world will collapse. Hey, a lady friend! - Let's crash her table. - Where are you off to? Join us for a drink here. Where are you going? - Eungam-dong. - The Han River. Yes, Eungam-dong, get in. - The Han River. - No. - The Han River. Han River, please. - No. - The Han River, please. - Yes, get in. Thank you. Eat up. You have to eat well. Here. Get out of there! You think I wouldn't know that you're hiding in the washroom? - Why are you running away? - Let go! You think you could escape from me? Don't buy alcohol with this money. You treat your husband like this? I am your husband after all! How could you leave me here alone while you went to your hometown? You're going to do whatever you want? Fine then! Welcome and take a look. My name is Choi. I'm the first son of the family that used to run the old brewery. Oh, right. How have you been? You remember me. I was hoping to see you sometime. - I'm a widower now. - Sorry? Oh, I didn't mean to be impolite. We'll probably meet again. Bye then. - Give me some tangerines. - Alright. Those awful motorcycles are roaring around everywhere now and it's hard on the ears. Mom. Sister! Hyeon-mi! - Hi. - Hyeon-mi. Look how you've grown! So pretty now. I've grown a lot, haven't I? - Yes. - Okay then. - Let's go over there. - No, where's mom? She's gone to the village. She says I have a long way to go. - Hurry up. - What is it? Come on, hurry. I can't believe this is still here. It's my turn now. I've been polishing it every day. Just waiting until I can ride it to school just like you used to. Is this really the one I used to ride? Let's go out. You'll teach me how to ride, right? Alright, let's go out. Wait, let me get changed quickly. Okay. - Be quick. - Alright. Hurry up! - Yes. - Oh, my. - How do I look? - Sis. You haven't changed at all. You're still a high school student. Really? Look at the back. That's pretty! You're so pretty, sis. - Let's go. - Okay, hurry up. - Oh! If it isn't Hyeon-ju! - Mom, mom! - Mom! - Oh, my girl! - Mom, let me look at you. - I might fall over. - You haven't aged a bit, mom. - What are you wearing? I'm back home. Mom, go wait inside. I'm taking Hyeon-mi to the seashore. But... - Come on, let's hurry. - Okay. Wait. I can't believe how she hasn't changed at all... Be careful. You ride so well. Wow, my sister rides so well. - Now to the left. - Yes. That's it. Pedal hard. Push me harder. There you go. Sis, you ride so well. - Get up quickly. - Alright. - Are you alright? - Yes. This is so exciting! - Let's get up. - Hyeon-ju. Hyeon-ju, as soon as my holiday's over, I'm going to Vietnam. - You will? - Yes. Oh, no. I'm not your teacher anymore. No, you're my teacher. Hyeon-ju, I don't think I can just leave you like this. When the war is over... - You'll meet another man. - No. Hyeon-ju. Please don't die. Don't die, don't die. Hyeon-ju. I want to be like you when I grow up. I heard you mastered a beginner's level in abacus calculation? Oh? Yes. - Let's practice some more on the bicycle. - Okay. - That's right. Here, let me push. - Yes. - Is this too noisy? - It sounds beautiful, mom. - You used to hate it when you were a child. - We were so poor then. The sound of the sewing machine reminded me of poverty. - Will you try meeting that man tomorrow? - What? If you haven't had an offer of marriage yet. If only the other man hadn't died in Vietnam... You could have ignored the rumors and gotten married. But he just filled you up with expectations and ruined your lot. This man has his reasons for rushing, too. He probably wants to trade off his second marriage with my rumors. I know about the old rumors. I heard it was a very passionate affair. I was run out of town for being a player. That doesn't happen to just anyone. - Will you give me a ride on your motorbike? - Sorry? - I want to feel the excitement of speed. - Alright, let's go. If people start to talk, promise you'll be responsible. Sure, of course. It would be with pleasure. Hello, boss. You're here. This is one of the businesses I operate. An oyster cannery. The entire stock is exported, so it has a tremendously bright future. Yes, sir. It has a bright prospect indeed. What a match for the two! This is another one of my businesses. It's not the size of a hotel but there aren't any other motels like this around here. I'm planning to expand it into a full-scale hotel. - Would you like to have dinner? - Alright. I guess you aren't much of a player as I had thought. - Sorry, what did you say? - Not such a player, I said. Yes, it's me. When did you get back? Yes, I'll be a little late tonight. I have a prior engagement. Anyway, I'll see you later. Two autumns have passed already. And another autumn is passing. Now, it's winter. Oh, I certainly like this. - What? - Living like this. - Aren't we going to have one? - One what? - A wedding ceremony. - Weddings are lame. Two autumns have passed already. And another autumn is passing. Now, it's winter. Oh, I certainly like this. - What? - Living like this. - Aren't we going to have one? - One what? - A wedding ceremony. - Weddings are lame. The customer who just left said you'd pay for his tea? Yes, sure. Teacher, I'm back from a trip to my hometown. How was your trip? Hometown? Full of empty rumors. Rumors? Yes, trips back home are always full of rumors. - It's like that. - How was it here? Here? It was a little inconvenient without you. But it's alright since you're back now. Honey, you haven't gotten drunk and got rowdy for a while, have you? What? No fun in that anymore. Really? That's true. It's all very convenient now. What is? What's convenient? Still no fun in it even like this? There has to be some fun in getting drunk and rowdy, right? - Alright, alright. It's fun. - Have your fun later. Then try to act raucously! Why did you go to the countryside? Did you go and cheat on me? You bitch. How can you treat your husband like that? Weddings are for people who wait in line at public toilets. Alright, I'll do it. I'll take it from here. Why should we get married? Even if we don't marry, I am your husband. I'm your husband, understand? Fine. Stop taking the contraceptive pills from now on. We'll have a baby. When the dawn breaks, we'll be wed. My job at the bank doesn't matter. Hey, is that good enough? Oh, my stomach! - I still have two more days of holiday. - You should get plenty of sleep. Smile Look at her striking a pose. Let's go. Excuse me, where do you live? You look familiar. How about a cup of coffee? There must be a coffee shop that's still open. The world needs more conversations. Don't you think? Could we have a little conversation? She looks completely different from behind. It's not our day today. I came home early for a change. I'm sorry but I'm still on holiday. Holiday, my foot. Oh, Hong Gil-dong is over. What happened? Give me dinner. I'll tell you about it. Alright then. So Hong Gil-dong took his chivalrous bandits and burst into the magistrate's place. - Oh my. - And he says, 'Bring out the treasures you seized from the people.' And they open wide the storage doors... The film set must have swayed left and right. The magistrate with the long beard was running away like crazy. He tripped on his long beard! Hello. Can I give you a ride to the bus stop? Thank you and goodbye. Let go of me. Let go! What are you doing? Let go! Oh, no. Stop! What are you doing? No! No! Why are you doing this? Oh my god. Hey. What's this? This is too much. She should have woken me up. - Hi! - Hi, it¡¯s chilly. Teacher... Won't you tell us? Later. Did you enjoy your holiday? - Mr. Park? - Yes? What happened in the past few days? You don't look so good. - Here we go again. - You can say that again. - Let's have a drink tonight. - Yes. Honey, what are these numbers? What? Miss Lee. What's the meaning of this? You must really want to get married. I hope you aren't thinking of me as your husband. Look here, have you gone mad? Where are your glasses? What's the matter with you? You never stayed out all night before. This guy has gone bankrupt again. How do we deal with this now? I told you that you look better without your glasses. Look, are you trying to get fired? If you do want to quit, quit quietly. What's with calling me 'honey' in there? Go home right after work, alright? What the heck? Damn it. - What time is it now? - Ten. - Thank you, ma'am. - Thank you. Excuse me, miss. Can I buy you a drink? I have a lot of money today but got no one to drink with. Gosh. Listen, miss. Can I get a light, please? Eat azaleas and play in the water... Miss, where do you live? Can I drop you off? Are you on your way home? Won't you dance with me? Now, miss... Oh, Miss Lee? Sorry. I'm sorry about that. - But you must be enjoying your honeymoon. - Honeymoon? I did not enjoy my honeymoon. She wasn't a virgin. Virgins, where have you flown off to? Miss Lee, don't ever tell on me. No matter what. Men are all the same. We don't like complications. Men are all the same! There are no virgins in this world anyway. Goodbye. Goodbye. What are you doing? Why are you doing this? Taxi! Tell me. What are you trying to do? We'll go meet your mother before we register our marriage. What for? I'm tired. I have to get some sleep. It's probably for convenience. If that's the reason... Hello, miss. Are you free today? The holiday is over. subtitled by Jean Noh proofread by Christy Shin Night Journey Planning Hwang Gi-seong Original novel Kim Seung-ok Adaptation Kim Gi-pal Scenario editor Hong Pa Assistant directors Kim Ho-sun, Ju Yeong-jung Cinematography Kim Deok-jin Assistant cinematographer Jung Pil-si Lighting Cha Jung-nam Assistant gaffer Ahn U-bong Music Jeong Yoon-joo Photograph Yang ki-zoo Prop Master Lee Sang-gu Editing Ree Kyoung-ja Developing Korea Color Film Lab Sound Recording Hanyang Studio Effect Choi Hyung-rai Yoon Jeong-hee Shin Seong-il Ju Jeung-ryu, Choe Hoe-yeong Choi Kil-ho, Yang Il-min Lee Ill-woong, Lee Ja-young Joo Hyun, Kim Hong-ji Producer Kim Tai-soo Director Kim Soo-yong Good morning.

It's not the size of a hotel but there aren't any other motels like this around here. I'm planning to expand it into a full-scale hotel. - Would you like to have dinner? - Alright. I guess you aren't much of a player as I had thought. - Sorry, what did you say? - Not such a player, I said. Yes, it's me. When did you get back? Yes, I'll be a little late tonight.

Smile Look at her striking a pose. Let's go. Excuse me, where do you live? You look familiar. How about a cup of coffee? There must be a coffee shop that's still open. The world needs more conversations. Don't you think? Could we have a little conversation? She looks completely different from behind. It's not our day today. I came home early for a change. I'm sorry but I'm still on holiday. Holiday, my foot. Oh, Hong Gil-dong is over. What happened? Give me dinner. I'll tell you about it. Alright then. So Hong Gil-dong took his chivalrous bandits and burst into the magistrate's place. - Oh my. - And he says, 'Bring out the treasures you seized from the people.' And they open wide the storage doors... The film set must have swayed left and right. The magistrate with the long beard was running away like crazy. He tripped on his long beard! Hello. Can I give you a ride to the bus stop? Thank you and goodbye. Let go of me. Let go! What are you doing? Let go! Oh, no. Stop! What are you doing? No! No! Why are you doing this? Oh my god. Hey. What's this? This is too much. She should have woken me up. - Hi! - Hi, it¡¯s chilly. Teacher... Won't you tell us? Later. Did you enjoy your holiday? - Mr. Park? - Yes? What happened in the past few days? You don't look so good. - Here we go again. - You can say that again. - Let's have a drink tonight. - Yes. Honey, what are these numbers? What? Miss Lee. What's the meaning of this? You must really want to get married. I hope you aren't thinking of me as your husband. Look here, have you gone mad? Where are your glasses? What's the matter with you? You never stayed out all night before. This guy has gone bankrupt again. How do we deal with this now? I told you that you look better without your glasses. Look, are you trying to get fired? If you do want to quit, quit quietly. What's with calling me 'honey' in there? Go home right after work, alright? What the heck? Damn it. - What time is it now? - Ten. - Thank you, ma'am. - Thank you. Excuse me, miss. Can I buy you a drink? I have a lot of money today but got no one to drink with. Gosh. Listen, miss. Can I get a light, please? Eat azaleas and play in the water... Miss, where do you live? Can I drop you off? Are you on your way home? Won't you dance with me? Now, miss... Oh, Miss Lee? Sorry. I'm sorry about that. - But you must be enjoying your honeymoon. - Honeymoon? I did not enjoy my honeymoon. She wasn't a virgin. Virgins, where have you flown off to? Miss Lee, don't ever tell on me. No matter what. Men are all the same. We don't like complications. Men are all the same! There are no virgins in this world anyway. Goodbye. Goodbye. What are you doing? Why are you doing this? Taxi! Tell me. What are you trying to do? We'll go meet your mother before we register our marriage. What for? I'm tired. I have to get some sleep. It's probably for convenience. If that's the reason... Hello, miss. Are you free today? The holiday is over. subtitled by Jean Noh proofread by Christy Shin
