Peter the First Part Two Script A. Tolstoy, Vl Petrov, N. Leshenko Director Vladimir Petrov Composer B. Shcherbachev Operator V. Yakovlev The characters: Peter I - Simonov Catherine - Tarasov Alex - N. Cherkasov Menshikov - M. Zharov The Swedish King Charles XII is marching with his entire army on Moscow. The Russians detain them at Poltava. On June 27, 1709 there was a battle. Your Majesty, Field Marshal Count Frensel reporting as ordered Reitarskaya that six regiments 4th dragoon regiment went on the attack. Lift me up, I want to see how Tsar Peter is running away. The Swedes broke through the line of redoubts ... Hurrah! Russian soldiers, this hour of danger must decide the fate of the fatherland. Do not think that you're fighting for Peter, but for the state, entrusted to Peter, for your people; for your country - go ahead! Fieldmarshal Boris, general offensive! The Russian army started the offensive. Russian comrades, the motherland will not forget you! Hurrah! Swedes, forward! In the name of God and your king! Staring-e-e-e! Swedes, Swedes, wait! Swedes, stop! The Swedes fled in panic ... Sire! 10,000 Swedes chopped without residue. 120 banners and standards taken! General Schlippenbach surrendered! - Who are they? - Field Marshal Count Rehnskold Prince W?rttemberg, Major General Schlippenbach, General Takelberg, General Hamilton ... Return their swords to them. Come to dinner, everybody! Hurrah! Russian soldiers ... sons of the fatherland ... Chady my beloved ... Through my labour, I created you. Without you, the state, as the body without the soul, can not live. Aren't you feeling love for the fatherland, when you spared your stomachs, and rushed by thousands to your deaths deaths, fearlessly. Russian soldiers, your brave example shall never be forgotten by your descendants! False alarm, Your Majesty. Arrived safely for you the Hetman Mazepa from the Zaporozhian Cossacks. What good news can you report, Hetman? General Zelengaund surrendered to pervolochnoy Prince Menshikov. Your army no longer exists. What other good news can you report? The colonels themselves include Swedes. With wise policy much can be saved, King. - Regain your fleeing glory? - And you, Ukraine? Say ... said the old man! - The glory is running away from. - Listen, King. Tsarevich Alexei hates his father and all his works. The Tsarevich is trembling that somebody else succeeds to the throne. The Tsarevich is hiding, as the serpent, on his father's bosom. - I'm sorry for Tsar Peter. - The Tsarevich is stupid, weak, and a drunkard. He will return, if only to be a kinglet among Moscow's boyars and priests. He'll surrender the Baltic, and Smolensk, and Kiev. Hurry to you your destiny, great Charles. Order them to deliver it to you, and not to Peter. I cooked the reliable little people [Ukrainians], but the Pole Nemchinov. Tsar Peter often goes out on a walk, free and easy. To lie in wait for him will be easy. Two or three thrusts with a dagger ... Take that glory yoursef, Mazeppa! I'm still the king, not a nightly killer! So we'll humbly lay our heads on the block? You're probably wrong. I'll march to Constantinople, we'll see. Well ... I as King to lead the troops of the Sultan, to praise yourself back? I'll act chivalrous and fight with swords, my not Zamorano. Tick?? Hetman! The Muscovites are coming! Tick, boys! The victory at Poltava forced the small powers of north-eastern Europe - Denmark, Poland and Prussia - to seek a military alliance with Russia. The great powers: France, England and Austria, warily watched the policy of Peter. Peter went on ... to take the waters at Karlsbad in Germany ... Petrushka, look, German soldiers. - How healthy they are! - They're ours. Where are our guys? In Germany? - Whose unit? - His Serene Highness', Prince Menshikov. - And what are you doing here, guys? - Shaking the apples of German women. They are fools, we collected, them all at once, Peter Alekseich. Well, let's have a beer? Your Majesty, here only men may drink. Well, then sit in a wheelchair. Come on, Kate. - Wow, the Germans! - Guten Tag ... willkommen ... Two glasses of beer and take a third to the carriage, Mr. philosopher Leibniz. - Petrushka, and let's have sausages. - Yes, two sausages. Why are you shy, guys? - Order them or what? Huh? - Come on! Come on, play fun! Come on, stir the pot for the Germans. - Danilitch! - Mein Herz! - What are you then? Open your mouth? Dance! - Mein Herz, it isn't suitable. I'm a marshal. Beer for everyone. After all, it would cost at least 20 marks?! - That's nothing, the Field Marshal is paying. - Come on, come on! So, Mein Herz, we cleared the Swedes out of the whole Pomerania. After that, I defeated the Swedes, took the city of Stettin with all the artillery, and I'm not happy. The German King clung like a limpet to this Stettin. He wants you to give it back! Well, bitte, bitte! And I'll answer him without your consent? Oh, it's hot ... Against the Germans our feet are small seeds. Hello, Danilitch! Oo-oo-oo! - When did you become important. - It is impossible otherwise. Overseas the sovereign honor shines. Setzen Sie sich! Mein Herz ... His Royal Highness, my king and lord, Friedrich Wilhelm I, after leaving Berlin, hurried to meet Your Majesty with the sole intent to spare you a tedious road and for friendly conversation with Your Majesty. His Royal Highness does not sit down at the table, but is waiting for the arrival of Your Majesty. Mein Herz, we ought to go for an hour. Eat, eat, Petrushka, all their the food is lean like that. - What is it? - Sparrows. They're a poor people. Poor, I say, the people as well as you? To the invincible Russian army. - To the unbreakable alliance! - To your generosity! He will ask for Stettin. You took the city by the sword, you're the boss - you and Dari! I give it to you! As a sign of eternal friendship, accept from us, my friend, the city of Stettin. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Petrushka, what did you give him? His own city. Last month, passed through Berlin the Crown Prince Alexei, your son. A very amiable young man. The most Gracious Sovereign Peter Alekseevich, has deigned to offer me the charge to found in St. Petersburg an Academy of Sciences. I expressed my views in the argument, that the true purpose of the great Russian state is not to move towards the West, where it is already crowded, but to move to the East, in order to lay the great trade routes to China and India. This is the historical mission of the Slavic race. Russian bones to pave roads for German merchants? - So what? - Petrushka, Petrushka! Petrushka! To the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences! What? A courier? Thief! Bloodsucker! Take a letter! Velu, Attorney-General Yaguzhinsky, immediately go to the Urals, to the Nevyansky plant, to Nikita Demidov and firmly question him about his stealing! Write angrily! So much for the plant, Antuficha Nikita Demidov. This court itself, it is in the forge. - What is that? - That? That is the bridge to the Nevyansky Tower. Come on, Fedka, tell us, how you slept with the Tsarina at the time? - Come on, come on, come on! - Well, how did you sleep ... - How does one sleep with a woman? You just sleep with her. - So how did you picked her up? - In Marienburg, with my sword. - Well? So much for my! I shall live on it for three days under my cart. - Like so ... - Look at the guy! The fresh man! Fedka, now you mean Tsar Peter is sort of like the godfather. And, well, who ran away from the people? Thieves, convicts? Finish the job! Ah, yes to the basement! Hurry! Guys, do not listen to him. A General came out from Petersburg for you, convicts. Those with cut noses and branded foreheads, hide quick! Yes, there never was a worse prison than yours, Satan! ??? The fugitives and convicts, where are you hiding them? Yes, God bless you, Mr. Attorney General. On my zavodishke all the little people of the villages. I then wrote to the sovereign for a fiefdom. Fugitives and convicts, we have not seen. And show me the cellars ... of the Nevyansky tower. Mr. Attorney General, the cellars in the Nevyansk tower are flooded. An accident: the gateways burst. Open the floodgates! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! - Right-breaking! - Rubbish Fedka? Look if there's anyone else. The owner ... all drowned! And you too will be. What are you standing for? Don't you have your bare hands? Come to the yard! ?? A nap in the afternoon, Pal Ivanovich, and a bathhouse. I have such a bathhouse ... the Turkish sultan even envies. - Sit down, Nikita Antufich. - We honor the ancient tradition of hospitality. I shall come to your house, then I'll sit down. - Cocky! - Don't shoot, boys! - Don't take their side. - Attention! Aim for the chest! - Shoot! - Stop! Stop! What are you doing, guys? Is this not a terrible sin? I am not Turkish or Persian, I won't accept a bullet. Stepan Razin himself kissed Timofeich on the mouth! - Do you want to kill me? - Shoot! Shut up! Guys, let's just go. Since we were raised on our Don, for all of you to work hard. Let's get the guns! Soldiers! Remember the oath! Listen to me! Fire! Fire! Fire! Grandfather, take our chieftain. Fedor, go to the Don. Raise the people there! If I'm still alive, I shall come to you. Grandfather, hide him well, he's a famous person. The early withdrawal of the Cossacks echoes in the woods. - What's your name then? - As if you care. Come with me to the Don! - Oh, you. - Hey! Yes ... The voivody, and the governors, and many others are responsible for the affairs of thieves. But most of all blame, is the Siberian governor Prince Gagarin. He robs the Kalmyks and Bashkirs and Russian merchants. And all of the Siberian provinces are ravaged and in his pocket. In dokonchane say that I was in the Urals, at Nikita Demidov Antuficha nevyanskite's plants. Treasury men wrongfully sold him to Prince Alexander Danilychev Menshikov. He, Nikita Dimidov, fearing the answer drowned in the basement of the Nevyansky tower, during the nachilsya riot. And many workers, overwhelming the soldiers, ran from his factory to the Don. Captain Fedor Luzhin and Captain Evreynov, you go to Kamchatka and beyond, where specified. And you'll describe all those places - establish whether it's America or Asia. And all these places you'll put on the map correctly. Go! Michael Serdyukov! You ask for additional 5000 rubles for the device to lock the Ladoga channel. Yes, sir. The Senate has considered your petition and consented to let you have the money. No, no! Don't you know the new decree? You don't bow with your the legs! Not for myself, sir, I give thanks for the cause. Well! Swiatlo Prince ... the Viceroy of Siberia, Prince Mattvei Gagarin, I ordered the governor ... to bring him to Petersburg in chains. - Mein Herz ... - Prince Mattvei Gagarin's chains hang at your house ... Mein Herz ... Zavorovalis, my dear children. Zazhireli! I don't think ... Peace, I won't give it to you! Next to you, he's the first thief. Damn beguiled me with these Demidov men. And the money they were Pleven! But we need to be, sir, for your life you will not regret and never regret. To this statement navorovonogo after you embezzled 2 million 600 thousand rubles! 2 million 600 thousand rubles? Lord! Where did spend so many things? 2 million 600 thousand rubles? A lie! By God, a lie, Mein Herz! A lie! Tomorrow these 2 million 600 thousand rubles, at 67 cents a penny, will be paid back to the state! A lie, Mein Herz, we did not take that much! At most a million and a half. Really, Mein Herz! Sober up, Your Sereine Highness! - Sweeten the mountain with that. - Eh ... Your health, Mein Herz! And, Peter Andreevich Tolstoy. When did he arrive? Last night, sir. Important news, sire. Leave us! Aleksandr Danilitch, stay! Speak! About your conduct, sir. In Europe, the are not happy with your conquests. Not satisfied, eh? Policies are particular. Who got you into a new war, and what fire was raked. Be brief! The King of England and the King of France joined with the Roman Caesar in secret alliance. This union was joined by Sweden. - Against whom, the union? - Against you, sir. In order to defeat you at sea and on land and to win back your share. Ungru - Swedes and Kiev and Smolensk - Poles. Brescia! Breshet dog, Alexander Danilovich and I have intercepted a letter. That's it! That's it! I had to pay a lot for it. Complained to me of stars, diamonds, dug out and sold. What would such a message get! And you a little present. Tsarevich Alexei Petrovich, hiding in Naples, under the Roman Caesar. - The designs of an unknown prince. - Careful, Tolstoy! You're playing with fire! - This thing is terrible! - I'm too old to play. I'm telling the truth. The damned foreigners won't do business. Well, what shall I do with them? You see a lot of product, public goods, and they are few. The devils are resting, how to sell them? What a laugh! Look, you old beard, you'll be punished, your wares will rot. One went wrong, I'll punish, I'll punish. While trading itself! Well, what? Prevail upon the merchants? Peter Alekseich, yes I caught these rogues. I treat them like this, and like that. I'm ready to hit them on their hands, and again they deduct. - Where are your merchants? - In Auster, they sit drinking. - I really don't go to them. - Come on, let's go! Ah! Avan kin! Two glasses of liquor! And salted lemons - eat. - Help yourself, your health, Tsar Peter. - Tsar Peter! Peter Alekseich, no snacks for me because my head aches. Ah! Kum! - Peter Alekseich! - Do you see how important he is, the drunk pilot. I'm waiting! I baptized him yesterday, so he is still .. the salty devil! in a drunken stupor. - Where are the foreigners? - There they sit, jowly. Well, merchants, will you buy our products? - They're expensive, Herr Tsar Peter. - Expensive, expensive ... Well, look for this product ... in your lousy Europe. Our price is justified, Herr Tsar Peter. The sailing is dangerous! Last week, the Swedes sank three of our ships. Well, no, and no trial! Somehow you'll manage without. Do you have the money? We have, Peter Alekseich. Kumpanstvo component, if the product won't be too expensive, I'll give five ships. Georgian hemp, flax, tar, wax. Take me to Amsterdam. Povezesh? - I'm afraid, Peter Alekseich, you haven't been taught the language. - During the voyage you'll teach me. - Well, yes, you know what? The Swedes can be afraid too? - Yes, no ... - Of guns that give? - Lady guns. I'll accept, Peter Alekseich! Prepare the decree! Merchant-navigator foreign patent. To 5 years, for not fulfilling his duties. As to you - Brovkin Ivan? Your father's name? Father's name ...? So you're, what? We will write to the motherland? But for this, sir ... Hosh that ask! Okay, the time will come and ask. We have considered, Herr Tsar Peter. For the sake of our old friendship we will buy the product. No, foreigner, it is now-a-ah! Vykusi! Where is the pilot Radilevsky? Pilot, wake up, damn salty! Wake up! Sire! Foreign ships are approaching. - Flag? - Imperial. They sent message that on board is a great ambassador of the Roman Caesar. They need a pilot! Pilot! Pilot! He's been drinking like a dirty ox! Get up, get up! Wait, wait! Give me the jacket! Give it back! Give it back! I myself will pilot the ship. Strengtheningok the fortress of Kronstadt, very solid. Solid, Mr. Ambassador. Course for foredevil! Give fore-buoys and sheets! Ovralno lining the sails! Zane form, go to the windy side! Push braces front sails! Donnerwetter! Hey, translator, what does that man shout? He is angry that our sailors poorly understanding of the language of this dog, Mr. Ambassador. It cannot be justified that Tsar Peter can sail his fleet, as an equal, in the Baltic and German Seas. Let these barbarians sit on the Neva with their guns. A thousand times the Swedes were right in blocking for Russia the way out of the Finnish gulf. Philosopher Leibniz in a conversation with me once expressed an opinion on Muscovy. Russian desire to European culture is contrary to nature. Russia is a rich country, rich like no other. But the Russian could never take advantage of the wealth of its mineral resources, forest lands. They are lazy and stupid! We came here to force Peter to stop the destruction of unfortunate Sweden. Peter imagines himself the new Achilles and wants to unleash on Europe his barbarian hordes. And if we see that Tsar Peter is uncompromising, then to hell with him. Let the guns speak! Tsar Alexei Petrovich will be more accommodating. This pilot, it seems he's listening. Put poniraly! Both anchors ready! Down with the sails! Petersburg! Here's piyatel, 5 guldens for vodka. Today, an equipped the ship will sail for Naples. Dead or alive - bring Alexei! Mr. Ambassador, today you will be given a small reception without presenting credentials. Perfect! Tsar Peter, they say, is quite simple. The Sovereign's manner is simple. Who is this man? Very similar to the pilot. Exactly like our pilot. They say that at the Russian court, you can sit at the table next to a simple peasant or a person of low origin. Sometimes, Mr. Ambassador. - The order has been given to the fleet? - Yes, sir! Big salute to the health of the Roman Caesar. How soon will the Emperor deign to come to us? Kindly be patient, Mr. Ambassador. Her Majesty the Tsaritsa, Ekaterina Alekseevna. It is the Tsar? Very frustrating when you think what we said about him somewhere else. And you gave him five guldens for vodka, Your Excellency. Last year, in Germany, I saw the celebrated philosopher Leibniz. Yes, I quarreled a little with him. Smart! Clever, but not clever enough for us. But clever for you, this Leibniz! And yes, we are lazy and stupid, your mind wants to live! - The whole world marvels at your genius! - Okay, okay. You have come to make peace with King Charles. In this world, we never refuse. Not for war, but for perpetual peace we returned to the Swedes our our ancient Baltic estates. Our state now without the sea pines, and without the sea, and honestly ready to trade and live in good neighborhood. Do you want to scare us ... Very well. And we have become intimidating. And in our opinion, if we fight violently, so reasonably only with Ivashka Khmelnytsky! Let's settle this with Bacchus! The health of our friend and brother the Roman Caesar, Emperor of Austria! Kindly look, the Russian navy. Quelle epistole remette in pro primani del cesare di roma imperator di Austria. E quelle epistole remette in Russia in pro primani del senatore di Russia. A long road ... Alyosha! Where does the road lead? Home? Who are you writing to? Quit that writing, let's play a game of little fools. Senators write to senators like me. Prince Vyazemsky loves me, Prince Buynosov loves me, Prince Dolgoruky loves me. The Metropolit writes, he whispers the priests too, and their parishioners. The British had promised me money, yes, Turks from Crimea yes podnazhmut Swedes. Everything will be as I want. You've been dreaming a lot, Alyosha, all in your head is confused. - No one will give you money. - Idiot! A fat lot you know about European politics. You fool! Why were you brought here? I'm not asking. Well, again, here comes Tolstoy. Euphrosyne! Euphrosyne, burn the draft. Ask the glorious Caesar to give me the troops ... No! No! I won't go! So tell father I'm not going to die! You talked to him? We must put an end to the affair. The Tsarevich must return on his own. He does not want to go ... And don't bother him with it. Our host, the great Roman Caesar, provides for us. - Who told you that? - I know, he promised. You fool! Don't believe your cards. Believe me! The Emperor promised us to deliver the Tsarevich. - Scarecrow. - I'll put the chain on him, you! I'll take him in a peasant cart - What's the use? ... If he returns of his own free will, the Sovereign will settle him in the city. He'll give you a village, a shower in fifty ... And to live in such a pleasure ... Young, lush ... - what a little white neck you have ... - It's not for you. Well, a neck ready for the axe to bite it. Sorry. - Satan ... - I you won't come back with good news, spoznaeshsya with an axe. Go for it! I don't want to live here! Several months no bath parilas. At home, the gooseberries are ripe now. The girls swinging on a swing. - Well, wait, be patient, my light. - I want to go home! I cannot eat the local food, it sets my nerves on edge. Well, what are you waiting for in vain? Do you think Caesar will give you an army? How can you wait! He promised to give you the throne. You ... how do you know about Caesar? Tolstoy, he sent you? Speak up, bitch! I'll leave for home ... Stay here - eat frogs ... My light ... How can I do without you! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Wait! Think about it, let's talk it over, don't scare me. My light ... Do you think I want to harm you? Fear not! Let's go home, the Tsar has forgiven us, we'll live in city. Get married! Back home? Promise! Kiss the cross. Roadside! Listen, soldier. Pass, Pass! The Governor of Taganrog has been put in chains for theft, the inquest started. What if we send to the Governor of Taganrog Prince Buynosova, Roman Borisych? - Buynosov is exceedingly stupid! - But he won't steal. What about him? He's rich ... he just doesn't have enough merit. We shall see! Well! Hello. Father, please forgive me. Thanks Alyosha .. What to listen, is back. And thanks for that. Nilly you will not ... want to live with us. And you want to travel to Moscow and be merry there, with your kind, the priests. - How can you say that, my dear. - Don't lie to me. Don't. Now, you have lived abroad for so long, but that you don't know the name of one, prepared to shed blood. Thy name, Aleksej, as 100 years ago, the name of Gregory Otrepiev, he would hand over the Russian soil, from end to end, to the Poles, Swedes and other foreigners, just like this, that living space couldn't be found. That's why I'm glad you're back. A pity ... you couldn't help me ... Look at the many cases... Every day more and more urgent matters, I don't know how to settle them all. Smoke once, Alyosha. Well, God be with you, live like you please. So what ... you want to go to Moscow? Allow me, sir. Well, go. Peter Alexeyich, what am I to do with the girl Efrosinya? - She knows a lot. - She should not be arrested, yet. Interrogations in secret. - You will be commander in Taganrog. - Sir, thank you for the honor. No, no. You will go to Moscow to accompany Alexei Petrovich. - You'll get an extra supply of tea there. - Yes, sire. This village looks empty. All desolate, Alexei Petrovich. All destroyed, the people run about aimlessly. Come on now, let's see if there's any cabbage soup? - Give us warm cabbage soup. - Father, our soup tureens are empty. Yes, and no bread. - What a poor life you people lead. - Oh, poor, Boyar. Meager. Look at you, we'll slaughter the calf. Noblewoman, mother, rescue our nurse. Don't lead her to slaughter! Okay ... Let's empty the soup. - And you, who do you belong to, guys? - Who we belong to? We're Prince Menshikov's, shackling peasants. Well, I was saying, to what position rose that man. And you guys, remember Tsarevich Alexei Petrovich? If we remember? Hell, we remember often! - Tsarevich Alexei Petrovich loves you. - What? - Oh, and you're a bad man. - What? Prince Menshikov loves them, the Tsar's son loves them. - And you spit on them, go away! - Where to? - Where will I go? - Penknife povostrey and gagged for leggings. And he went to the free Don region! - Who are you going? - Happy people. - So will a thief! - Yes, no, maybe worse. Alexei Petrovich, God is with them, the soup, we get out of here, out of harm's way. All Orthodox shave their heads, like cats. The law of God is not told to teach, not told to teach arithmetic. Desolated temples of God, dome obgazheny crows. I look at these walls ... Here is Russia! Grandfather, .. ists ... no German ... sausages. And make no purpose. And so strong was Russia, that Brodeur covered his face in shame, Aki the dove of holy ignorance offered prayers. Your grandfather, Alexei Mikhailovich, was the quietest, and Ukraine join! And Anafime had Stenka Razin's head cut off! And we are 15 years at war, and all to no purpose. - The Swede is the world and does not want to sign. - Shut up, pop! I feel sick. Yefrosinya left the yard when it was still light and she hasn't arrived. Still hasn't arrived. Euphrosyne! Well, what did Tikin learn? By order of Tolstoy, your Yefrosinya was taken to a secret chamber. Damn! My wife is with God. She will soon give birth, and it's in a torture chamber, on the rack! Not the people - the animals! Okoyannye dogs, devils! It's a terrible thing, as well, as Euphrosyne, by feminine weakness, will say too much. Our heads will roll! Tikin, what to do? What shall we do? For you, Alexey, all the old nobles, all the clergy, all the tradespeople are for you! Don't delay, raise the people, send short people to the north, to the dissenters, the Volga, the Volyn, Astrakhan! In the Don there's now confusion and weights, walking through the town is chieftain Fedka! Prince Roman Borisovich rides voivod to the south, even to walking zavernet Cossacks and reads them to your wagon. Sign it, great Titley! Secret thoughts of my ferrets?! Here, I will tell my father about you all, you damned, that podbivate me suprotivstvo. I'll tell all, really! You weak leader, Alexei Petrovich, go? Look out! What meal for you the people will accept. Orthodox, go to churches and parishes, tell to all how Moscow prayed for Alexei Petrovich. Not for earthly care ... Let the whip bite the body izyazveno, but the soul will be saved. And our salvation - Tsar Alexei Petrovich Boys! A Boyar from Moscow! Boys, you nob. Prince Buynosov! - Who are you? - Meet at the crossroads. Fool! Lead me to the chieftain. - Blessed be the leader. - Why? Therefore it is necessary. Fyodor Ivanovich! Fyodor Ivanovich ... Cossacks for you. Ataman, a Boyar came from Moscow. Teya buy! Yeah, you're not angry, anything can happen. - So you poosteregsya. - Bring him here. At least until the leader. Prince Roman Borisych? - F. .. F. .. Fedka!? - Remember? I remember ... Of course! - Hello, Fyodor! - And I didn't forget thy whip, my lord. What whip? Yes, the Lord is with you. The whip that struck me for the last 7 rubles arrears. And I was standing in your hallway in the cold, removing my trousers. Fyodor, so for the sake of order you were beaten. About those 7 rubles, I forgave you long ago. But I have not forgiven, lord, now you take off your pants. Basil, get away from shame. And, now, boys! - Hold it! Hold it! I come from the Tsar! - Oh well, show to the letter! - Read it. - Points give vzdet. Oh, my God! We, the sovereign, the autocrat of all, Great, White and Little Russia, Tsar of Kazan, Astrakhan, Siberia, Ugra, Perm and all the Nordic countries, lord and sovereign of the Iberian lands land and Ottich Dedic ... Hm ... Gundy did not! Glasses ... Read on! Tsarevich Alexei Petrovich, in alliance with white and black clergy and his nobles and gentry tells you thieving Cossacks and Gultyaev, discontinuing your theft are for the Orthodox faith, the Tsarevich and his persona. And what do we get out of this? What do we gain? All in all, the whip, yes, eternal bondage! The Tsarevich will welcome you, forgive you your stealing. And we ourselves forgive you. Yes, what to talk to him ... Ah, yes! Take him into the circle! Cossacks! In the circle! In the circle! The Tsar's son sent to us his Boyar to buy you, Cossacks. You're to give a hand to their violent heads, Tsar Peter the gall! A king would have put it, Alexis, with the nobles and priests. And for that he'll perhaps not distribute the land, nor gold, nor a red coat, and perhaps those that it does not allow to beat the old case. As for new orders, whether to hit or not, in order to read and write, it doesn't say. Think, Cossacks, what answer shall we give the Boyar? I told you go to Petersburg - at once! Come with me! You wrote, Alexei Petrovich, to Petersburg, to a Senator? - Don't look at me, I won't advise. - No, it wasn't that. You're lying! I know everything. And you wrote and asked for an army from Caesar. They slandered me! I didn't intend it! Sit down. Sit, Efrosinyushka. Tell the truth. Well ... I say ... I will say, as to the spirit. The Tsarevich wrote a letter to the Roman Caesar, and to Senators. - You're lying! - You wrote it! I saw it myself. Alexey told me to throw it into the fire, and I left him. - Here before they enter. - Let's go! To what Senators did you write? Give me the names. - Be called? - No! They shall take you. My Lords Senators! After our great victories over Sweden, the European countries no longer despise us, but hate us. And endeavor to drag us back to our old backwardness, together with the robes and beards of old Russia. It won't hurt bitter if I read out the renowned historian Badendorf. Not only will the Swedes, but other European peoples as well, have a hatred for the Russian people. And endeavor to maintain the aforesaid in their former slavery, and art. Especially in military and naval matters. But would soon expel from the Russian channels not only weapons, but whips from the entire world! And the Greater Russian State divide into small principalities and provinces. That's what Europe wants to make of us! My son ... Aleksej ... wants the same. There is evidence that he wrote to the Roman Caesar, asking for an army. In order to win his father's throne. In order to rule as kinglet in Moscow. In order to have our great fleet - burned! Regular troops out of hand! Ingram, Petersburg and the Baltic Sea to give back to the Swedes! Indeed, while we cast guns and subject our homes to deprivation, we should remember the wise principle: Keeping the peace, does not mean weakening the military! We do not want war, but peace! We have enough wealth for 100, 200 and 300 years, enough for us to work in peace! My Lords Senators! My son, Aleksej, wishes war and the ruin of our state. In this and in the terrible fact help him his priests and boyars... in his idleness. I myself ... I do not presume ... to judge this disease. Alexei Petrovich I entrust to you, Gentlemen of the Senate. Judgement and sentence. So be it! What is it? That light is bright? - Calm down, have a drink of water. - Leave it, Kate, leave.

Without declaring war on us, England sent its fleet into the Baltic Sea to unite itself with the hostile Swedish fleet. Our squadron should find the enemy, and when they find the enemy, it should attack and by Our Lady, beat them. Officers! Order must be fulfilled electric stand not his stomach. There execute the order! How many Swedish ships on the horizon? 16, Sir Auburn. How many Russian ships on the horizon? 8, sir Auburn. When are they going to fight each other, Swedish squadron and the Russian squadron. It looks as if the Russians are going to attack the Swedes, sir Auburn. In any case, they have not involved us in this fight. Damn it with all my guts, gentlemen, if I'm wrong. What else do you see there? The Russians have the advantage that they stand in the wind of the enemy. The Swedes at anchor, barely have time to turn around, sir Auburn. Everybody up! Chop the ropes! Scorch kernel! Volley from the right side! Wick fell! Volley port side! Wick fell! Volley from the right side! Wick fell! Volley port side! Wick fell! Volley from the left side! Wick fell!

Blow up the ship! The Swedish flagship lowered the flag, sir. The Swedish flagship raised the Russian flag, sir. We have done the trick, gentlemen. Order of the fleet! Raise anchor! Course west-northwest! Damn it with all my guts, gentlemen. The end of the war! Eternal peace! The war is over for all time! Drink, eat, have fun! The end of the war! Eternal peace! The war is over for all time! Drink, eat, have fun! But the pies! From piping hot! Paul penny per pair! Well, bring the pies! But the pies! From piping hot!

Paul penny per pair! Here, Peter, sit down. Well, where's your oldest man? Here's a very old man. Wow, Dad! Good morning, sir. Hello, son. Are there many years left to you? Up to 100. Yes ... Many years still up to 100. And you, my father, Alexei Mikhailovich, remember? I have never seen him, but I remember well! And my grandfather, remember? Tsar Mihail? I've never seen him before. King Mihailo - remember. And the Poles in Moscow, remember? I was little back then, and I remember well! And there was then, sir, Prince Parnasskii, by Minin ... beaten. Yes ... a lot of you have carried on your shoulders, man. Ooh, a lot! Well ... Hello! On this happy day after the war, the Gentlemen of the Senate, gave me the title Father of the Fatherland! I was harsh with you, my children, but it was not for myself I was severe, but for Russia! My labours and yours were crowned with the glory of our motherland and already now, Russian ships are sailing into all harbors of Europe. Our labours were not in vain and glory be to our generation and to the wealth of the fatherland, may it be preserved and multiply! THE END subtitles: bornik&serdar202 @ KG [need further corrections]
