Hey. Hey, yo, Tyler, this is my boy. - Reggie. - Right, Reggie. And, Reggie, this is my cousin, Tyler, man. Good to meet you. So, what's the last thing you heard? I mean, is she okay? Is the driver hurt as well? Where are the kids right now? Ty, I don't know much, man. All I know is my mom called me and asked me to come down and get you. The kids are fine, but I didn't even ask where they were, man. All I know is both cars are totaled, and I don't know about the other driver. All I know is Lauren pretty fucked up and she needs you, man. Damn! - Oh, thank God. - Hey, yo, Tyler, don't answer that phone, man. This is Lauren, what do you mean don't answer it? Bro, don't answer that phone, Tyler. Whatever! Hey, baby. Michael Cain Reed, what is wrong with you? Let go of your brother! Stop, stop! You know what, sit! Have y'all lost y'all mind, wrestling in my kitchen, huh? - He started it. - No I didn't! Look, look, I don't care. Now eat your cereal so y'all can get to school. Eat! You ready? Mmhmm. Okay, come on. Have a good day. Stay together. Bye, mom! Hello? Yeah, yeah, I got it. No, I understand. Question, is there anyway you could leave, the box and the bag and all that, can you leave that like on the back porch? I'm just thinking about the kids, you know, like... Hello? Hello? Because I better be your only. Oh damn, I better get that divorce then, huh? Oh, yeah, you better get the divorce quickly. Okay, okay. Oh wait, does she have any money? Stop playing with me. No, we can figure something out now. So, tell me about your day. I had a good day. I cleaned up after the boys. I had a good nap. I picked the boys up from school. And somehow in the middle of all of that, I managed to have amazing sex with my fine-ass boyfriend. Oh you wanna play, huh? Oh you started it, huh? Yeah, you did. Mmhmm, and I'ma finish. Come here. You got a boyfriend? Mmhm! - Does he fight? - Oh, yes. - All right, what's his name? - Tyler. - What is it? - Tyler. - Say that again. - Tyler. You know, I actually need the pills so I can take them. - I'm sorry, I was just- - Hey, lady, I don't care. Just hurry up. Oh, shit, wait, wait! Look, lesson one, when selling drugs, always keep your eyes on the customer. Look, I ain't even gonna tell Willie you did that. Here, okay? Okay. Hey, hey, hey, hitting the machine only works in the movies. Now why are you hitting my machine? Because your machine just took my money. - Okay, sweetheart. - Don't call me sweetheart. Okay, ma'am or lady, could you please stop hitting my machine? If it took your money then I- - Willie, I need to talk to you. I need to talk to you now. I tell you what, give me five minutes and I'll be back with double your change for being so patient. Fair enough? Sure. Now how about you and I go to the back and talk? Please? Five minutes, okay, just five. Willie, I can't do this anymore. You can't do what anymore? Willie, I can't do this anymore. Okay, okay, calm down. Don't rattle my customers. Did something go wrong? Yes, no, just this whole thing is wrong. I can't do it anymore, no. You know, Lauren, maybe I shouldn't have asked you to do this. Maybe I misjudged you. You see, I thought you were a woman that was willing to do anything to keep her children off the streets and out of the shelter homes, but, yeah, maybe I did misjudge you. Listen, no one is forcing you to do anything. I mean, hey, if this isn't for you, then this isn't for you. I totally understand. Oh Willie, thank you, thank you. So, is five or six best for you? Five or six, I don't know what you mean. To get out of my house. I mean, you know what our deal was. So, if you can't do this anymore, well, you know. Baby. Tyler! Huh? What's wrong? Nothing, I'm good baby, why? You're not eating your food. I'm eating it. No you're not, I'm looking right at you. I really don't wanna talk about it. How was your day? You know what, don't do that. - Don't do what? - Deflect like that. Baby, I'm not deflecting. I'm just- You just what? I'm just trying to find a way to ask you, when did you wanna take that trip to Hawaii? Trip to Hawaii? But no, you said we would couldn't take any vacations. Wait, did you do it? I did it baby. I finally got you a boat. - I love you so much. - I love you. too. - Oh, thank you, baby. - You're welcome. You know I'll do anything for you. - Hey, boys! - Hey, mom! Hey, how was school? - Fine. - Good. Michael got in trouble. - No, I didn't. - Yes, you did. Hey, hey, that's enough. Now, what did I tell you about telling on your brother all the time, huh? - But mom- - But nothing. What did I say? It's not cool to be a snitch. That's right. Now go in the house and start on your homework. Michael, what happened? I know you heard me, I'm not gonna ask you again. What happened? It was just a stupid boy telling everybody, making fun of me and telling everybody I had no dad. And I thought I told you to ignore kids that will say things like that. I did, but he kept saying it, so I pushed him to the ground. Michael, you can't just put your hands on people just because they're teasing you! My God, I hope I don't have to go up to that school now. Go in the house and start on your homework. Go, go with you brother. Go. Well, you know if you're jealous that the boys like my cooking better than yours, you're just gonna have to take that up with them. You know what, you are really feeling yourself, because if you think my babies like your cooking better than mine, you crazy. They do, and I have proof. Oh okay, so what's your proof? Well, I would tell you, but I swore secrecy to my sons that I would never tell their mother that they told my cooking better. Oh, you swore secrecy, that mean you lying. No, you lying. Don't be kissing me with all your lies. Go somewhere. Lies, it's true. Hi mom, when's dinner? It's gonna be ready in a minute, okay, baby? Hey, Michael, how'd you get that cut on you? I got pushed down at school. What! What happened? When did this happen? It happened today. I don't know the kid's name, but he's always pushing us down. Okay, well, did you tell a teacher or an adult or something, sweetie? No, because that just makes things worse. Then I would be the kid that get picked on even more. Okay, I don't care about somebody picking on you, I care about someone hurting you. Do you hear me? Baby. Michael, listen to me. I know your mother and I have always told you that fighting is a bad thing, but don't ever let people bully you, okay? I want you to always stick up for yourself and your brother, too, if he gets picked on. You hear me? Yes. Okay, go to the bathroom. We're gonna clean this up, all right? Are you okay, baby? Yeah? Okay. So, we teaching our kids to fight now? That's what we doing? No, no. We're teaching our children how to stand up for themselves just like we were taught. I wouldn't be a good father if I didn't do that, baby. Okay, well, how about you be a great father and you can finish dinner. You know everything. Okay. They like my cooking better anyway. I'm sorry, baby. Excuse me? I'm sorry, we're not open yet. Yeah, actually I'm here to meet Alex. - And you are? - Lauren. - Is Alex expecting you? - Yeah, he should be. Actually, yes, I am. You can come with me. Where's the rest? That's all I have for you. I don't know what you mean. Is this some kinda joke? No, I wouldn't joke about that. Well, I ain't paying for half an order, so give me the rest of my shit. I'm sure you could just call Willie, right? And I'm sure that you can just go back and get me the rest of what I'm paying for, right? - Sure. - What are you doing? I'm going back to get the rest of your order like you asked me to. That's all good, but this stays here. Wait, wait, what, no, no. I said go get the rest, not take this with you and get the rest. I got customers waiting on these. I open in few hours. Okay, so what am I supposed to tell Willie? Tell him to get me my fucking pills or I ain't gonna pay him shit. Sounds pretty simple to me. D, how you doing, man? Is everything all right? Everything is more than okay. So okay, to the point, that you can stop sending me care packages. - Stop sending? - I mean- - Wait, what are you talking about? You can stop sending me care packages 'cause your little brother is coming home. Hello, hello? Sorry, yeah, man. I guess I was just taken back by the whole thing, you know, all the excitement. Did you hear what I said? Yeah, yeah, I guess I got a little choked up, man. But, hey, that's some great news, mm-hmm. So when is the big day? As soon as a month. It's happening, man. It's really happening. Okay, all right. Yeah, yeah, great. So, look, do me a favor, man. How about call me back tomorrow and we finish talking over the particulars, all right? All right, you take care, man. Be talking to you soon. All right. Yeah, whatever, Lauren, some of us aren't blessed to have the best husbands every morning. We sure don't. Uh-uh, Mrs. Reed. What? What did I say that isn't right? You know not about to be talking about my father-in-law like that. Look, things come off. All I can say is the terrific man that you're married to, that you have in my son, he's not cut from the same cloth as Mr. Reed. You're not supposed to say that about your husband. I'm not gonna even laugh at that because I don't even have a man to talk bad about. So, Mrs. Reed, Mel, I'ma need you to be a little bit more thankful for what you got. It's hard for out here for a sister, you all know this. Because it's like these men these days are cut so differently. I mean, no manners, no respect, and no- - Education. Let me tell y'all this. I think I told you already. So I'm at the gas station the other day and this guy walks up to me, and I was staring at him, and he probably thought I was stuck up. Don't say nothing, Mel. You are stuck up. - Sometimes. - Okay, sometimes. I did not understand anything that that man was saying. I just stared at him. - Mumbo jumbo. - Mumbo jumbo. Okay, well, ladies, hang on, let's not just put it all on our men 'cause ladies these days, they move faster than a cheetah trying to make a kill. You know they do that. You right. You know they do that. Yeah, they do it all the time. Oh, they do. Well, I know I'm grateful for my husband. I love Tyler, I appreciate him, and I make sure I show him and tell him every day. Every day. We do not wanna hear about you and my brothers antics. See, no, wait a minute, I wasn't even going there. That's just your nasty mind. There's too much laughter coming from a group of women in my kitchen. Don't be in here brainwashing my wife. - Brainwashing your wife? - Yes, I said it. Tyler, okay, okay, and what if she was out here brainwashing us? - Oh, she better not be. - I'm innocent. Innocent, did she just say she was innocent? Can you guys just give it a second? Boy, get up on outta here and leave us alone. - Okay, okay, I'm going. - Leave us alone. I'm going, I just came to get some beers, geeze. Well, get your beer and get gone, Tyler. Don't be talking to talking my baby like that. I'll tell y'all who. His name is Mr. Kobe Bean Bryant. Man, if you don't get outta here with that bullshit. Well, listen, man, Kobe wasn't even better than Magic, let alone Michael Jordan, what are you talking about, man? Kobe was MJ. He literally stole every move the man had. So what I miss? Man, your brother down here talking nonsense. Tell him Kobe was better than MJ. Damn, Eric, I brought you back a beer, but maybe you don't need no more to drink. Hey, where you was at? You too good to drink with us now? Man, see, that's how you be acting when you got your lady around. That's what it is when Lauren around. I'm gonna tell Lauren how drunk you really get. I'm so sorry, oh my god. Hey! Michael, stop! What is wrong with you? Stop it! What is wrong with you? He talks too much. Look, I don't care, do you hear me? What have I told you about hitting your brother, huh? You better open up your damn mouth, do you hear me? Yes. Now both of you sit down. Stop! Now if I hear anything, you can't watch TV and you're going to bed early. And I mean it. I wish it was you instead of dad. Yeah, Michael, I wish it was me, too. Because I knew you would get mad, baby. I knew you would get mad. And what? You think him popping up over here without me knowing, I wouldn't be mad? What the hell, Lauren? People change, Tyler. He is not the same person. How do you know that? Because I know he's not the same person. How do you know that? You know what, you know what? You, you are unbelievable right now. Oh, oh, I'm unbelievable? Yes, you are unbelievable right now. My wife goes behind my back and invites the one person in the world who I said is no longer welcome in our house. - My cousin. - And I'm unbelievable? My cousin, my first cousin. He's a criminal. He's a fucking criminal, Lauren, that's what he is. Am I interrupting something? Hey, you know I can leave if it's causing a problem with you two. No, no, you are okay. He'll be fine. Cuz, you know I do not know what you see in him. Chance, don't do that, don't do that right now. What? Hey, I'm just trying to look after my little 'cuz, you know? Oh, you trying to look out for me. - Yeah, yeah. - Really? No, it's more like me looking out for you, right? How in the hell you trying to look out for me? Because I'm one of the only one in the family who still deal with you, right? Am I lying? You right, you right. I give you that, I give you that. Do you know what he did for me? Who you talking about? Tyler, Chance, Tyler, that's who I'm talking about. Well, you know how I like the water. Remember when granddad used to take us on his boat? Yeah, yeah, yeah, we had fun, for sure. Well, I told him I wanted a boat of my own. And he told me to give him just three years without spending too much money on our Christmas or holidays, you know, anything like that, vacations. And he say he gonna make it happen. And a few nights ago, he pulled me from the kitchen table, and he took me upstairs to the bedroom. Now shut up! I know it sound like a movie or something like that, but he spread $100,000 across the bed. - Cash? - Yeah. He got the money for my boat! And I guess you can imagine what happened next. Gosh, guess what happened next, here you go. I know you not in to all that lovey-dovey stuff. You can keep all that lovey-dovey shit, I'm gonna keep messing with these hood rats, you know what I'm saying? Oh, gosh, there you go, whatever. I'm just trying to let you know he really loves me and he'll do anything for me. You came to the party. Supposed to. Gosh, it's crazy how y'all can't get along though. But anyway, shit, it's cold out here. Come on, let's go back in to the party. Oh, no, you good. I came out here to smoke anyway. I'll be in there in a minute. But you're coming back in, right? Yeah, I got you. I got you. All right. - I'll holler at you, cuz. - All right. 100,000, yeah. I need that, for sure. All right, so you called me to tell me that your cousin is about to get a boat? Nah, man, are you listening, bro? I called you down here to tell you you about to be up $40,000. Oh, I must have missed that part 'cause I don't get it. We gonna steal 100,000, what you don't get? You gonna rob your own cousin, man. That's just dirty. Is it your cousin? Okay, then. You wanna get this money or not, man? Come on, man. All right, fuck it. Let's say we do it, how we gonna do it? That money probably in bank by now. Nah, see, that's what I thought, too. But me and cuz got to talking the other night, she started drunk talking, you know how she do. She said her husband old-school and keep that money in a safe place in the house, man. - Word? - Exactly. So you already know what's up, man. Hold up, 100k? Why am I only getting 40? Don't get greedy on me. I set this shit up. It is what it is. You can take this shit or leave it, man. You know what's up. All right, let's do it. Let's roll, G. So you asking me to help you make a decision against your own flesh and blood? No, I'm asking your opinion on a business decision. I make a lot of money outta that place, a lotta money. If my brother gets out, well, then, hell, there goes the connect. Well, find another connect. Start over? You know I don't trust people, what the hell, Steve? Well, Willie, we know you don't trust nobody, but what I can't see, I done a lot of shady shit in my time. I did some shit even against my own blood. But I was younger then and about that almighty dollar. And now that I'm older, I look back, I wouldn't change any decision that I made. The reason why we stayed in business this long is because we're not afraid to make the decisions that keep this business going. If you're asking me what I would do in this situation, I say do whatever it takes. Now, excuse me while I tend to my other businesses. And as always, it's been a pleasure doing business with you. I understand, I understand, and I give you my word that it will be done. Yes, sir. Okay, thank you, you, too. - Hey, Tyler? - What's up, Des? There's this guy here that says he's your cousin, Thanks, Desmond. Chance, what are you doing here? Tyler, we gotta go like now. What? Why? Lauren's been in a bad accident, like real bad. What? What happened? I don't have all the details like that. I just know Lauren's mom called me and asked me to come down to get you. She said it's probably not a good idea that you drive, so they sent me. Look, I'm just trying to do my part. We gotta go like now, man. - Hey. - It's what up. Hey, yo, Tyler, this is my boy. - Reggie. - Right, Reggie. Hey, Reg, this is my cousin, Tyler. - What's going on? - It's good to meet you. So, what's the last thing you heard? Is she okay? Is the driver hurt as well? Where are the kids right now? Ty, I don't know much, man. All I know is my mom called me and asked me to come down to get you. The kids are fine, but I ain't even ask where they were, man. All I know is both cars are totaled, and I don't know about the other driver. All I know is Lauren pretty fucked up and she needs you, man. Damn! - Thank God. - Hey, yo, Tyler, don't answer that phone, man. This is Lauren, what you mean don't answer it? Bro, don't answer that phone, Tyler. Whatever! Hey, baby. - Mom. - Yes, baby. - Are you okay? - Yeah, why? Because you were just looking like a zombie. Yeah, I'm okay, I'm just tired, that's all. Mom, can I have another bowl of cereal? - Yeah, go ahead, baby. - Hey, that's not fair. You always tell me no when I ask. Well, life is not fair, Michael. And how about you don't worry about his second bowl and worry about finishing your first bowl. And Abel, don't fill that bowl all the way up because I know you will not eat it, and we not about to be wasting food around here. Now, look, I have to work tonight, so y'all gonna have to go over to Auntie Ebony's house, okay? Cool, can we spend the night? I don't know, it just depends on how late I have to work. But no arguing, no fighting, no wrestling. Do you hear me? Okay. I want you two on your best behavior, Michael. Come on. Abel, baby, tie your shoe. - He doesn't know how. - Yes, I do! No, you don't. Hey, hey, hey. What did I just say? What did I just say? Stop. Hey, boys! What's up? Now you already know the rules. No hug, no entry. Mm, I love y'all. Y'all cousins is in the back, okay? - Bye, mom. - Bye, baby. Have fun, okay? Aren't you forgetting something? All right, have fun, baby. Lauren, how you dropping him off and he already mad? No, no, Michael is always mad. But don't worry, he only hates me, okay? Girl, these kids, I promise you, I wanna call the police on myself. That Christine, if she roll her eyes and smack her lips one more time, I'm gonna choke her. No, no, no, rolling eyes? I'll take that over the things Michael say to me any day. - Girl, you don't know- - No, I already know you do 'cause you're dealing with girls. Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, so crazy, so crazy. But, um, thank you for doing this, thank you. Come on, Lauren, you know it's not a problem. What is a problem though is you not talking to me. Lauren, what's going on with you lately? You haven't called me. I don't what's- I know, I know, I know. I do have a lot going on, but, look, I'm gonna tell you. I am gonna tell you. I just, I can't tell you right now. - Okay, okay. - But you just gotta trust me. - Okay, I got you. - Okay? Take care of your business. I got the boys, don't worry about them. - Okay, thank you. - All right. Okay. I'm gonna call you. I love you. I love you, too. - All right. - All right. - I'm gonna call you. - Okay. All right, bye. Hello. You know, Lauren, I think I overreacted a little bit. Been doing this business for a long time and never has one of my clients ever kept my product and my money, even when I came up short. But don't worry about it. I took care of that whole situation with Alex. Look, I know I messed up. I should have called. No, don't worry about it. I shouldn't have just let it- - Don't worry about it. Hey, I understand. I told you I took care of that whole situation. But my point remains, me telling you to get outta my house was a bit of an overreaction. So I called you down here today to offer you an opportunity to get out. Meaning, to get out of your house? No, no, no, no, to get outta the deal. Willie, I'm not having sex with you, if that's what you're thinking. See, that's the problem with you pretty women, you say one thing and then you mean another. Don't flatter yourself, sweetheart, you're not my type. Okay, so what are you thinking? Well, I was thinking that you'd do one last delivery, one big delivery. Is it safe? It doesn't get any safer, it's a prison. Willie, a prison? No. No, let me explain. I run a very, very lucrative business out of that prison with my brother. You'd be surprised how much drugs and illegal things that go in and outta that place. It's actually mind-blowing. Also, I think I put you in a losing position from the start because, obviously, pushing pills is not your thing. Now, you may not be the best at this, but I damn sure can't say that I can't trust you. So my proposal to you is that you make this one last drop with my brother and then you and your boys can stay in my house rent free. It's just that simple. What do you say? So how does it work? Glad you asked. Let's talk about it over lunch. Hi, I'm Lauren. Put your hands down, we're relatives, remember? Look, I'm gonna make this quick. Make sure you let him know this is the absolute last time that I'll do this shit. And when you tell him, make sure that he believe. Sure, okay. I don't need sure, okay, from you. I need, "Yes, I definitely will." Yes, I definitely will. All right, so shit, look, I assume you got something for me, right? Inmate, up against the wall. - Wait, what the fuck? - Wait, wait! - Come with me. - What is going on? Wait, wait, can I talk to you for a minute, hello? Hello, don't I get a phone call? Can I talk to you for a minute? It was a mistake! Can I get a phone call? Hello? Oh, sweetie, come here! May I come in? Is now a good time? Come on. There you go, baby. Thank you. Really, I can't even imagine what you must be going through, so I won't even pretend to try. I wanted to talk to you at the funeral, but I kinda thought you might need some time. How are the boys doing? How are the boys? The boys are missing their father. - Of course. - That's how they are. Of course. Aunt Rhonda, why are you really here? What do you mean? I wanted to check on you. Well, you could have called for that, right? I just wanted... Okay, honestly, I really did wanna come by and see how you and the boys were. But I also wanted to talk to you about this whole situation. This situation? You mean my dead husband? - Yes, that. - Okay. And how the situation went down. Lauren, listen, I'm asking you, no, I am begging you, please don't get on that stand and testify against Chance. You're gonna send him away for life. No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Did you just say his life? His life, don't take his life? He took my husband's life, the father of my babies. Yes, because of you. What do you mean, because of me? Because of me? I'm not here to blame you, but you know your cousin. You knew what could happen. Lauren, you knew better than to tell Chance about all that money. You of all people know exactly how your cousin's mind works. And at the end of the day, Chance didn't pull that trigger. You know what, you know what? I'm gonna have to ask you to go, auntie, because I'm not about to stand here and allow you to blame me for what Chance did to Tyler, what he did to my damn life! I had to sit my babies down and explain to them that their father is never coming home. Yeah, yeah, Chance needs to go to prison and he need to rot in that motherfucker, okay? He is evil and cold-hearted. Yeah, your son. So, if you knew that Chance was evil and cold-hearted, then why would you tell him something like that? Why would you tell him about all that? I didn't tell him like that. Oh. I was just trying to explain to him how much Tyler loved me and how he would do anything for me. I wasn't giving him an invitation to come and... You have every right to make whatever decision you like. But if you take Chance's life away, then you're just as evil and cold-hearted as you say he is. Lauren, you are my only niece, but Chance is my only son. He is all I have. Yeah, and Tyler was all we had. So get the hell outta my house. Hello? I'll accept the charges. Hello? Hey, hey, hey, calm down, calm down, okay? Hey, look, I'm already on it. You'll be out soon. Lauren, just breathe, okay? Yeah, look, soon mean sit tight and know that I got you. Yeah, I can do that, hold on, hold on. Okay, what's the number? Okay, I got it. Listen, just sit tight, stay calm, okay? All right, look, I'm gonna pay your bail and then you'll be out then, okay? All right. Well, if it isn't my favorite prosecutor in the whole world. Yeah, look, I'm gonna get right to it. I'm gonna cut to the chase here. It's time to cash in on the favor you owe me. Your Honor, I would like to call Lauren Reed to the stand. Your Honor, I would like to deny bail for Ms. Reed due to the fact that I believe she's a flight risk. Objection, Your Honor. Under what grounds, Ms. McGee? Hearsay. Your Honor, the defendant has been saying how as soon as she gets outta here, she's getting away. Getting away as in another state, Your Honor. Wait, wait, that is not true, that is not true. Ms. Reed, quiet please. Your Honor, that's still hearsay. Your Honor, if allowed, I would like to call my witness to the stand to testify against Ms. Reed. Oh my God, look at you. Ebony, I'm pretty sure that's not the first thing you're supposed to say when you come visit someone in here. I know, that was stupid, that was stupid. No, it was just you. Are you okay? Lauren. Girl, if this was supposed to be a happy visit, oh my God, you are failing miserably. I know, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Wait, what's wrong? Is everything okay with the boys? No, no, they're fine, they're fine. They miss you and wanna see you. I told you, not like this, Ebony, no. - I know, I know. - No. I know, I know. They don't even know I'm here, okay? Okay, so why are you here? You told me it was important over the phone. I just, um, I can't keep the boys anymore. I'm so sorry, Lauren, I'm so sorry, okay? I'm trying, I just don't make enough money for all four of the kids, and then the girls, they don't mix with the boys. I'm just- Ebony, Ebony. - I'm so sorry. - It's okay. Look, I'm grateful for the time that you have been able to keep them. Do you hear me? I do, it's just - It's okay. - I mean, I'm trying. Lauren, I am trying, I promise you. I know, I tried to get another job. Lauren, I promise you I did. I tried to get another job. I know, I know. And they won't give me any more hours at work. I just, I'm trying. Can you just give me at least a week just to figure something out? Absolutely, yeah, of course, of course. Is there somebody I could take them to, Lauren, maybe a family member or an in-law, somewhere? Wherever you want me to take them, I'll take them. Lauren, I'm so sorry, so sorry. - Oh, hey! - Hey. - Well, come on. - Come on, come on. Have a seat on the couch. Oh my goodness, wow, you guys are getting so big. You have to be what, 20 now? - No. - No. No? Yeah, you're right, that's way too young. You all have to be 40 by now. - No. - No. - Oh goodness. - Okay, let me talk to your auntie. Go ahead and watch TV, okay? - Do we have to? - Yes, go. You all, listen to your mother. - Gosh. - Oh, you're doing so good. Yeah, but looks can be deceiving. They are missing their father like crazy. They cry every day and I cry right along with them. I understand. No, you don't, but, um, but you will. You're family, so I wanna be honest with you. I don't wanna treat you like someone off the streets. But, um, I decided to testify against Chance in court. Well, if that's your choice, then you may as well start treating me like someone off the street, because we are no longer family. And trust me, the rest of the family will feel like me. You think you feeling loneliness now, just keep living. Your money will run out sooner than you think and then what will happen? You're gonna get a job? Please, you have never worked a day in your life. Oh, you will need me. You're gonna need us. And when you do, we wont be there. And then you'll know what it feels like to have family turn their back on you. Now you think about that while I go get your boys. Sit down and don't move. - Mom, I'm hungry. - Me, too. Well, I'm hungry, too. So as soon I can get this laundry done, then I can figure out what we're gonna eat. - What are we going to eat? - I don't know. Mom, can we get McDonald's? Michael, I said I don't know! And just what the hell are you looking at? Mind your damn business. No, no, Michael, you are not about to do this to me in here just because you have an audience. Do you hear me? Do you hear me? Fix it. That's right, big boys don't cry. Excuse me, but don't talk to my kids. Sorry, just thought I'd help. Well, trust me, you can't. Trust me, I can. So you need a job and a roof over your head. Yes, so like I told you before, you can't help me. So can we wrap up this little meeting or whatever we have going on here so I can get back to my boys? Well, I can't knowingly let a young woman and her kids live on the streets. We don't live on the streets, okay? I would never do that to my kids. So don't sit here and judge me. No judgment, but I guess I'm a little confused because out there you just told me that you were homeless. Yeah, meaning we don't have a home. But we stay in shelters, even motels. So, on the streets. What if I told you I could offer you a job and a roof over your head? How? Well, the how isn't important, but the what is important. Now what I mean by that is outside of this laundry mat, I have another business. Now that business isn't completely legal, but it's simply this. You work for me, and you and your boys can stay in one of my rental properties for free. For how long? For as long as you work for me, you and your boys can stay in my house rent free. - Wait. - As long as you work for me. Wait, now I know you are not talking about prostitution because I am not selling my body or anything. No. No, no, please, please, don't insult me like that. I had a sister that died of breast cancer years ago, I have a loving mother, a beautiful daughter, and an ex-wife. I don't disrespect women. Okay, so what do you have in mind? I don't know if you're ready for this. You know anything about this? That's your ticket out. Lights out! Fuck you! McQueen, could I please just use your cellphone just for one phone call? I just wanna make one call, that's it. How bad you want it? You got five minutes. Hello. Yeah, I need you to do something for me and it's not negotiable. Alrighty, well, well, welcome to your new home, boys. Now you guys know in order this to work, you got to learn to speak, correct? We don't talk to strangers. Strangers? No, now I'm definitely not a stranger. Matter of fact, I'm more like, like an uncle, yeah. Matter of fact, you boys can call me Uncle Willie. Now you talked to your mother, right? Yeah. See there? She wouldn't have you come stay with a stranger, would she? No. So then. Let me show you to your room and then we'll go back out and we'll grab your things out the car, okay? - I'm hungry. - Me, too. Okay, I tell you what. Once we put your things down in your room, then I'll take you guys to get something to eat. How does barbecue sound? Good. Well, how does that sound to you, Abel? My name's Michael. Oh, okay, well, how does barbecue sound to you, Michael? - Good. - Okay, great. I'll tell you what, and then tomorrow, hey, I'm gonna show you guys how to swing this bad boy here in a game of baseball. You guys like baseball? Yeah. Outstanding. All right, let me show you these rooms. Well, you're really missing your cue, Tyler. This is the part where you come and save the day, right? Lord knows I need some saving. I know you're looking down and you're disappointed, but I'm sorry, baby, what was I supposed to do? I couldn't find a job. Not like selling pills is a real job or anything, but he kept his word and the boys have a good house. It's in a good neighborhood, it's rent free. They miss you so much. I miss you, too. I'm promise I'm gonna do whatever it takes to take care of them and to make sure they have a good life, just like you wanted. I promise. Willie, where are my fucking kids? What are you talking about? You know what the hell I'm talking about! Lauren, you're making a scene. Please, sit. I have been calling and calling and calling you for months. I wanna speak to my damn kids! Lauren, I can promise you your boys are fine. You know what, fuck your promises, Willie! Your promises are the reason why I'm in here for seven years. You know what, maybe I should just be a little birdie, yeah, and just chirp in the judge's ear or somebody's ear about the other business you have outside of that bullshit ass laundry mat of yours. Yeah, maybe I should do that. Careful now. I just promised you your boys are fine. I can easily promise you that they wont be fine. Okay, and what does that mean? Oh, it means exactly what I just said. Now lets get talk about the real reason I'm here. Things haven't been going too well with my brother and I need you to take his place. Are you crazy? Are you crazy? No, the only thing I'm doing in here is my time so I can get home to my boys. Let's see, what is that thing that you told me before? Uh, yeah, it's non-negotiable. So if you wanna see those boys again, you do exactly what I say. Why are you doing this to me? Oh, no, no, baby girl, don't do that, don't do that. Don't put emotions into it. It's not personal. You see, a good business associate of mine told me before that the reason I've been doing this so long is because I never hesitate to do anything that it takes to keep my businesses going. And by now, you should know that you are my anything. So, you're setting me up? Lauren, listen, I need you to do one thing for me right now. Well, actually, three. One, I need you to understand that I don't make threats that I don't keep. Two, you need to think about your boys. And lastly, if you wanna do something with those lips now to bring me total pleasure, you'd say, "Yes, Willie, we have a deal." Hey, there he is. What's going on? Hey, where's your brother? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? He wanted to stop by the store and I didn't, so I kept walking. What? What did I tell you both? You're to never split up. You told us come straight to the laundry mat after school. I was just doing what you said to do. Come on, let's go find your brother. Allison, I'll be right back. Okay. Take care of this for me, love. And make sure when they come in to get that last machine. See, here he is. I'm taking you boys to see your mother tomorrow. - Really? - Yes. I can't wait to see her. Hey, Michael, aren't you happy to be going to see your mother tomorrow? Hey, Abel, it looks like you're done. Why don't you go pick out a special outfit for your mother tomorrow? Remember what I said would happen to him if you told. I didn't tell him anything, I swear. And I believe you. But don't you think that all that moping around is gonna cause him to ask questions? Yes. So get your shit straight, or what happened to you will happen to him. Now go pick out a special outfit, too. And Michael, I'll see you tonight. - My boys, hi! - Mom! Oh my, oh, I miss you so much! I miss you so much, look at you, you're so big. Mom, we're the same size. No, you're not, you're like giants, look at you. Mom, when are you gonna be back? I'll be back really soon, okay? Really soon now. You boys been good over at Uncle Willie house? - Yes, mom. - Yeah? - They're fine. - You been having fun? Mom, can we play patty-cake, patty-cake like we used to, please, mom, please? What? Can we play patty-cake, patty-cake like we used to, please, mom, please? Okay, you wanna play patty-cake? Okay, well, come on. Okay, boys, can you give your mother and me a minute and you guys can come back and finish talking and playing? So, you happy now? You've seen them. No more talking about shutting down my business or else I can promise you they won't be fine. Yeah. Yeah, I understand. Guard! Come on, mommy gotta go, okay? - No, mom! - No, please. No, it's okay. I know, it's okay. I'll see you soon, okay? I'm gonna be home soon, okay, baby, okay? - Okay. - Okay. All right, let's go, boys. You get your brother tonight and run, okay? - Okay. - Okay. We should get home and play some more baseball, huh? What do you guys think? Cain, Cain, yo! You ready? Don't it look like I'm fucking ready? Nah, nigga, it don't. It looked like you spazzed out or some shit. My nigga, is you high? I'm here is what I am. About ready to rob this motherfucker or not? Look, we gonna do this shit and we gonna do it right. Don't fuck up. Yeah, all right. Hands up, man! Put your motherfucking hands up, nigger. Okay, okay, I'm just putting them in the cooler. Don't give me that scared voice. Just relax, do the fuck I say, and you gonna be fine. The fuck you doing? Go get the tapes! Where are the recorders at? They don't work, man. I'll be the judge of that. They're back there, man, straight through the back door. - Keys. - It's open already. See how easy this is. Now, if you could kindly show me the other money that's here besides the money in that register. And don't tell me there ain't no motherfucking money in that register either. It's here, man, it's here. What you waiting for? Whenever you tell me I can move. You know what? I like you. I got to rob you more often. Yes, absolutely, you can move and go get my money. And hurry the fuck up and get my bread. - Well? - We good. Go cover that door. Let's go, let's go, let's go! Drive, just drive! Gino, you okay? Gino, is you okay? Gino, you all right, man? He dead, man. - Well, there she is. - And who is she? The sexy woman I allow to cook dinner for me every night in my kitchen. Oh, she doesn't seem interesting. Is that all she does? I mean, she does little things here and there, like cleaning, sending me off to work, things like that. Oh, if that's all she does, maybe she should just leave. Over my live body. Oh, Abel, they're amazing, thank you. Yet, they're not for you. Oh, really? And what side chick do I have to fight for these flowers? - Daddy! - That side chick. Butterfly! - Hi, daddy. - Hey. Guess what daddy got you? What? Those flowers that mommy kidnapped. No, those are for mommy. No, actually are yours, Bella. I was just about to put them in a vase for you so you can put them in your room. Really? Thank you, daddy. You're welcome, butterfly. Now go with mommy and go put them in your room. Let's go. Is she sleep? After a small temper tantrum that her dad didn't come read to her, yes, finally. How bad was the tantrum? Bad enough that you owe me. - Oh, is that right? - Yeah. So what do I owe you? Close your laptop and I'll show you. Take your clothes off. Now why would I do that? Because I have nothing on under this robe. What's up? - The fuck you doing here? - What you mean? I mean, what the fuck you doing here? Hey, man, you know what's up. Nah, I really don't. - Today is the day. - Day? The day we supposed to divvy up. Oh shit. Are you series? I spent that money. What you mean, you spent that money? That was only a $3,000 hit. Then you owe me 1,500. I owe you nothing. Now do yourself a favor and get the fuck outta here. Come here asking for money. Nigger, I just lost my best friend. 'Cause you couldn't drive off in time. You ain't lose your best friend, you killed him. What the fuck you just say? Huh? I ain't hear you. What the fuck you just say? Don't get quiet now. Why don't you just accept the fact that you got played by a bitch? That's 411. Get the fuck outta here. Walk away! Hey, yo, baby, grab me another drink. Yo, yo, yo, Debo, Debo, no, he good, he good. He good, he good. Well, if it isn't my nigga Cain. What's up, brother? Can I get you something? Drink, weed? Nah, nah. Shit, my fine ass lady, mm, mm, mm. I'm good on all that. Whoa, you good. See, that answer right there usually isn't good, man. Usually any motherfucker would be happy with, shit, all these offers. You got my money? - Look, Cricket man. - Wait, man. Something tells me I need to sit amidst of these pretty hands. Now you were saying? I ain't got your money. Well, why not? I ain't got it, I tried to get it, but she pulled a gun on me. And that's the truth, no bullshit? The truth. So how long you gonna need, Cain? I said how fucking long you gonna need, Cain, before I get my money? I don't know. I don't know. I don't wanna give you a date I can't keep. This nigga telling the truth, no bullshit. Okay, Cain, obviously, you see, I ain't tripping about the two g's you owe me. It's just the principle, you know? All right, look, I'll help you out. I'ma clear out your debt, all right? Now, what I'm finna do, me and my lady over there about to go upstairs and make some babies. Now while I'm upstairs making some babies, my guy, Debo, right here, he gonna beat the shit outta you. He gonna continue to beat the shit outta you until me and my lady is done making babies. Now, either we could do that or I could just kill you. Now, Cain, I really don't wanna do that. But I think it's better off we stick with option A, all right? Come on, baby. Have fun. Two weeks. Wait, what was that? I'll have your money in two weeks. Okay, cool. Hold on. But if you don't, just know there won't be no option A. I'm just gonna have to kill you. So, two weeks, nigga. Hey, yo, Debo, just motherfuck with him. Hey, you wanna talk about it? No Baby, don't shut me out again. We've come so far. I'm not, V, I promise. It was just a bad dream. You have been having them a lot lately. Maybe we should go back to the therapist. Not happening. I promise, I'm fine. We can do a search for him again. I said I'm fine! Yeah. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry, I promise I'm fine. It was just a bad dream, okay? Okay, let's go back to bed now. I'll be on in a minute, all right? All right. Remember what I said would happen to him if you told. - Okay, cool. - I didn't tell him anything. I swear. And I believe you, but don't you think that all that moping around is gonna cause him to ask questions? Yes. But if you don't, just know there won't be no option A. I'm just gonna have to kill you. So get your shit straight, or what happened to you will happen to him. Two weeks, nigga. Now go pick out a special outfit, too. Jimmie is my favorite. Jimmie? No way, I like Buster. No, not Buster. What! Buster is the best. No, Jimmie's the best. Abel! In here. - Hey. - Just in time. Could you please tell your daughter- - Before you say anything, I need to show you something. - Okay, what is it? - Come in. Hey, brother. Daddy, he looks just like you. Sweetie, this your uncle. - Hello. - Hi. Why don't you come with me and let your uncle and your dad talk? Come on, sweetie. Where the hell have you been? In jail? I just would never thought- What? That I'd end up like mom? No, I'm not saying that. I'm just saying I just never thought you would have did a crime. It's been 10 years. A lot has changed. - Yeah, but Mike- - Cain. What? I officially changed my name to Cain Reed. It's probably one of the reasons why you couldn't find me. Well, and I didn't wanna be found. - Why? - Why didn't I wanna be found, or why the name change? Both really. The same reason for both, really. Mike had a pretty fucked up life. Father murdered, mother in jail and murdered. I didn't want no dealings with my old life once I became legal. - But I was your brother. - And always will be. My brother is doing pretty damn good for himself. I guess I'm doing all right. All right? Man, look at this! Big ass house, nice cars, nice family. What else is there to want? Trust me, you can always want more. Nah, this is all I ever wanted. Well, this is us now. You're staying with us till you get back- - No, no, no. - I insist. - Abel. I'm okay, really. Well, what can I do? - Honestly? - Of course. You can loan me $2,000 to pay somebody who's really pissed off I haven't paid him yet. And maybe a night on the couch. Okay, how about 5,000 and you stay two nights. Throw in another one of these and you got yourself a deal. All right, bit. Good morning daddy. Can we go to the park today? Daddy, you okay? I'm fine, but I'm not- - Well, look at you two hitting it off already. Good morning, butterfly. Daddy? Well, I hope I still am. Your uncle didn't take my spot already, did he? Good morning, daddy. Can we go to the park today? Maybe later. Me and your uncle got a busy day today. - We do? - Yeah, we do, so go get dressed. I would but I don't have any- - I know, man, I mean go get something out the closet. Hey, family meeting and I didn't get the invite? Good morning, mommy. Good morning, love of my life. Well, what that leave me? You should know that from last night. Ew, that's gross, isn't it, Uncle Cain? Ew, the grossest. Get a room, you two. What does everybody want for breakfast? Actually, me and Cain got a lot to do today, babe. We'll probably be back by dinner. Well, you two have fun. I guess it's just us two for breakfast, sweetie, let's go.

It's fine, trust me. Thanks, man. Ah, shit, I gotta take this. Everything okay? Oh, yeah, it's fine, it's just job. Go ahead in and I'll bring your bags in in a minute, man. There's my king. What's wrong? - I'm, I'm Cain, not Abel. - Oh, shit, I'm so sorry. I didn't realize it. I saw your jacket and I- It's okay, it's okay. It's fine. He just bought me the same jacket. You'd be surprised how many people confuse us. Oh, I'm sure not like this. Oh, definitely not like this, okay? And if this could just kind of stay between us, it would be great. We on the same page, we're on the same page. Oh, you even sound like him. Well, dinner will be ready in about 30 minutes, so I hope you're hungry. - Can't wait. - Sorry, again. Front door. Abel, you're here. What's up? Nothing. Just I'll be in the kitchen. All right, come let's go get these bags out the car. Front door. Morning! Good morning. Good morning, babe. What's happening? Nothing much, just trying to persuade Cain to stay a little longer. Oh, Cain, you're leaving? I thought you were staying till tomorrow. No, I was, but I decided to get outta here a little early. And where are you headed? You know, I don't know, I'll see when I get there. You know, you're welcome any time. Thank you, thank you. Hey, babe, I hope it's okay, I gave Cain some of our luggage to take a couple things. Oh, yeah, for sure. Okay, I'm gonna take him to the bus stop. I'm serious, don't be a stranger. Of course, I promise. I'll be back sooner than you think. All right, let's get it. Front door. Hey, you think we can go past that old creek we used to go to when we was kids? Our hideout, the lair that we knew about, so we thought. Yeah, yeah, that one. You think we can drive past there first for old time sakes? For sure, yeah, we can. You know, I don't remember it being so far into the woods. Me neither, but nothing seems far when you're kids. True that. I think I do remember, actually. Yeah, I remember that tree over there. - You know what I remember? - What's that? How mom used to always yell at me, never believed you started the fights. I used to always be on punishment. I remember all the horrible things Willie did to me. Just horrible things. I remember being in and out of jail, getting my ass kicked over and over. I remember all the horrible nightmares of me being assaulted. I remember missing you, but not ever wanting to know where you were just because I didn't wanna bring my fucked up world to yours. And now that I see your world, I'm so happy for you and so jealous at the same time. You're so lucky. You were always the lucky one and I'm glad I got to see you again. I'm sorry. I really am. Me, too. Hey! How did it go? Lets just say, I'm glad to be home. Hey, babe. I'm just wrapping up a few things.
