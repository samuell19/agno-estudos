Man has to face many storms in life. But this orphan has to face another storm. And that is his helplessness, his weakness. And sense of loneliness. Aman. - Father. What are you doing here by yourself? Somebody definitely comes to meet or take home all the kids. But nobody comes to meet me or to take me home. Don't I have anyone in this world? Yes, my son. Those who have nobody... He belongs to them. Pass the ball. - He's lame. He can't. Pass the ball. You cripple! Can't you hear? Pass the ball! Not only deaf is he lame, he's also deaf! He won't understand like this. - Then how will he? Now let us see you walk. I'll show you! Calling him lame. You call him deaf. Thank you pal. You helped me a lot. What's your name? Akash Verma. And yours? From today Akash and Aman are friends. Aman! Aman! See what I have for you. This looks imported. Must be expensive. That's not your concern. You eat it. What's in your hand? - A 10 paise sweet. Give it to me. I like it. - What are you doing? That was for me, I ate it. This is for you so you eat it. Let go! What are you doing? You're always up to something! What if somebody sees you? So what? I'll ask them for permission. Mister Viewer, can I romance my wife? I've got used to asking for permission. First ask you if I could romance you then your parents to marry you. Then the priest to get us married. A year later take permission from our son, put him in the cradle... And ask can I go to her? When we first met, it felt as if you didn't have a tongue! I still don't. - Stop it. Now it's 100 parrots on one side and you on the other! Parrots? - Yes. Who will believe that you are Rajiv Verma.. ...the owner of Verma Estates? The father of a 12 year old boy. That reminds me where is our son? The rich brat. Gone to meet his friend. Since he found this new friend he has forgotten his old pal. Good morning, dad. Hello mom. Hello dad. - Hello, son. Dad this is my best friend Aman. Hello aunty. Hello uncle. Where do you live son? What do your parents do? I have nobody. I live with Father D'mello. No Dad, he's lying! In this world I am his! If you love him so do we! Never say that you have nobody. Didn't you bring Aman? He refused to come. - Refused? Where are you going? - Let him go. What we adults couldn't do, Akash's love will do. Will you come or not? - I will. What's going on? - I'm looking for a coin I lost. Acting smart with me? - Honest. But what are you doing? He's asking me! I'm looking for a 50 paise coin I dropped. What's going on? He lost 25 paise and I lost 50. We were looking for them. Come out. I'll find the coins. Get up. - Let go my ear. - First get up. Come out. - Someday he'll get me thrashed! Come on. The kid is bad enough but the Dad takes the cake! By god! I'm terrible. I'm getting fired thanks to you! No, I got fired because of you! He's too much. Excellent. Aman, did you alone win all these cups and shields? I'm proud of you. You are terrific. What's terrific about it? It's thanks to your blessings. He is always terrific but ask your useless son what he has brought. What did I say? I knew Mummy would ask this question. But I haven't come empty-handed. If Aman has brought a cup, I have brought a plate. See this. Now answer me! - See how cheeky you son is! Aman has brought a cup and he a plate! I'll teach you a lesson. - Mom, I bought this for Rs. 15. Stop there. - No mom, please. Tell her I'm 24 years old! Forgive him this time. Next time he does something, beat him not me. Here's the plate. Please get some tea. - Shut up. You'll never change. - You'll get me thrashed! You've spoilt him thoroughly! - Daddy, your dialogue. I know. Stand straight. Does love spoil anyone? I love you too. Are you spoilt? - The kids are watching. Have shame! What is it? Why are you laughing? Thank you. The loyal and efficient workers of Verma Constructions. Today I introduce you to my sons. This is Aman. Aman Varma. And this is... - I am Akash. Akash Varma. Okay carry on. - What's left to say? I forgot what I had to say. You have encourage me so far. To strengthen our foundation. After today... Help these boys in the same manner. Thank you very much. Please, come. This is the office of Varma Constructions. How is it? - Very nice but what will I do here? What do you mean? Here's a telephone. You have fingers. There are girls in town. Call them up and have fun. Can I really? - Absolutely. You are the greatest dad in the world. - Is it? You are the naughtiest child of the world. What are you doing? I had heard about angels. Never seen them but today I can say confidently.. ...they're just like you. What have we done? The honour you've given me by giving me your name... That's a debt that I can never repay. You call our love a debt? No dad, I mean.. - Why do you talk of debt, loan, obligations? I've never considered you any different from Akash. Of course. You think he's intelligent while I'm a fool! And that's right. No. Let's go. - Yes. - We have to attend a party. But you won't go anywhere. Where are you going? - To meet these. What's this? - List of girls. Rita at 12, Sita at 2. Meeta at 4, and somebody at 6. And when I return home at 8, my Dad gives me a spanking! Your list is driving me mad. Okay, should I move? Today is the first day of office. - That is true. Okay, should I move? - If Dad calls? Then I'll be in trouble. Okay, should I move? What if you're needed in the office? Okay, should I move? Please go ahead. - Okay, I'm off. "This is the first time we have met..." "and my heart tells me that I have fallen in love." "Ever since you cast a loving glance at me..." "my heart has been yearning for you." "This is the first time we have met..." "and my heart tells me that I have fallen in love." "Ever since you cast a loving glance at me..." "my heart has been yearning for you." "The one I dreamed about..." "is with me today." "I haven't the sense to know whether it's day or night." "I am a romantic at heart, thus I romance..." "you are a mischievous young beauty..." "you mean the life to me." "In love with you, my love..." "every moment of mine has blossomed with joy." "Ever since you cast a loving glance at me..." "my heart has been yearning for you." "This is the first time we have met..." "and my heart tells me that I have fallen in love." "Do not be shy..." "use the amour in your heart." "Such opportunities, do not lose..." "take my hand." "I'm the one every heart beats for, every heart is crazy about me..." "but my heart is crazy about this trait of yours." "You are the one who rules my heart, my love." "Ever since you cast a loving glance at me..." "my heart has been yearning for you." "This is the first time we have met..." "and my heart tells me that I have fallen in love." "Bewitching eyes, a lovely face..." "and a voluptous body..." "it shines like light in water." "In these lanes, you are the one they are talking about." "But what good is your beauty without a lover?" "Take me in your arms..." "my heart pines, my love." "Ever since you cast a loving glance at me..." "my heart has been yearning for you." "This is the first time we have met..." "and my heart tells me that I have fallen in love." The heart is at peace by a glimpse of you. Aman. The enemy of my peace is back! Aman, come soon. Aman. What is it? Come on. Finally found time? I had so many business appointments since morning that I'm tired. Only now I've found time for Menaka darling. Let's go out. We'll freak out. Come on. No, I'm exhausted. I'm feeling sleepy. You are a spoil sport. Go to bed. This isn't your cup of tea! That's a funny friend you have. Why? Why didn't he come with us? Said he's tired and sleepy. Neither is he tired not sleepy. - Meaning? I know him very well. He must be reading something. You mean it was an excuse. - To get rid of us. Why? Because he's not interested in anything. Not even in pretty girls? - Girls? He runs miles away from them. He's a modern Viswamitra. If I disturb his penance...? I'll throw a grand party for you and your friends! Really? - Really. What's this? - A picture and this for real. I'm busy and Akash isn't here. - I know that. But what do I do? Since I set eyes on you, I see only you! You misunderstand me. I'm not interested in these things. I know that you're the modern Viswamitra. But my name is Menaka. And I've become to disrupt your penance. Considering that you're Akash' friend, I'm asking you to leave. And if I don't go? - I'll have you thrown out of here. You can't do that. What happened to her? What do you think of me? There's no place in my heart for society girls like you! Don't ever try to come here again! My foot won't come to you! Have you ever seen your face? I got talked into a bet. Otherwise a man like you only deserves pity not love! You snubbed a pretty girl like me! That is why God has rendered one of your legs useless! If I had my way, I'd break the other leg too! You're a beggar living off others in addition to being a cripple! Do you know what happened.. I'd bet you to win his heart not break it! You've insulted my friend! I'll... What are you doing? Are you mad? Take her out of my sight! - Let's go before something happens. Forgive me. Menaka has been punished for her deeds. It's not your fault. It's that bitter truth of my life... ...that I'm used to living with. Time will tell whether I'm an ember or a dew drop. At the moment I'm a tear glistening on the lashes of time. Exquisite, I swear by poetry. At this tender age, such thoughts, such depths. This upliftment. I swear... Every word of your poems... ...stings the heart like a dagger. But I don't understand.. ...in spite of being the loved poet of thousands.. Why are you a stranger to them? Why don't you let people know that... The one rising like the tide in their hearts is none other than you! No, I can't do this. Let it remain a secret. - But why? I'd like my feelings to reach every corner of the world. But I'm scared to come before the world. If mother, Dad or Akash feel my pain in my songs... They will be very hurt. They might feel there was something lacking in my upbringing. I can give up my life for them. But I can't hurt them. I live for them not myself. Great! Not only are you a good poet but also a good human being. I swear by the couplets. You embarrass me. Let's get down to business. According to your instructions... I send all the royalty earned by your books to... Father D'mello's orphanage. These are some letters and fan mail. The rest is ordinary but... This is very special. She seems a devoted fan. She is always requesting me for your songs, your poems. And her name is Miss Pooja. I will fulfill her request. I swear by poetry. I swear by poetry. "I love you so dearly, my love." "I love you so dearly, my love." "I could swear to it..." "I could swear to it..." "I could even swear it on God." "I love you so dearly, my love." "I love you so dearly, my love." "My poem is but an inspiration from you." "My poem is but an inspiration from you." "Without you, I do not wish to live anymore." "I shall love you dearly..." "I shall love you dearly..." "as long as I live." "I love you so dearly, my love." "I love you so dearly, my love." "Much as the waves rising in the oceon..." "Much as the waves rising in the oceon..." "I love you as much too." "This is the pining that will never lessen." "I love you so dearly, my love." "I love you so dearly, my love." "I could swear to it..." "I could swear to it..." "I could even swear it on God." "I love you so dearly, my love." "I love you so dearly, my love." The name that I have earned by singing your songs... ...is truly yours because the words were from your treasury. I'm sending you a cutting of the picture of me receiving the prize. And a gift for you. Received your letter. Was happy to read its' contents. I've kept my word and sent you my new poem. Hope you like it. If you don't, don't hesitate. Let me know so I can write even better. Sagar. The blank frame hanging in my house and I await for your photograph. Pooja. You snubbed a pretty girl like me! That is why God has rendered one of your legs useless. If I could, I'd break your other leg! Not only are you a cripple, you're a beggar who lives off others! The Sagar (ocean) of my joy. The Sagar of my imagination. Every word written by you sends my heart racing. Your words woven with pearls are my very life. I pray to God that you keep writing. Pooja. Today your face is extra bright. What's wrong? - Nothing. What's wrong. Looks like you're a victim of love. With you around anything can happen to me. Not love. - Why? Because you have the world rights for love. You're talking to me but your eyes are on that girl. She looks as smooth as a duck! She's beautiful. I'll enjoy it when the mountain sitting next to her falls on you. You're talking of the mountain? I'm thinking of cuddling up! That mountain? - No, the girl. The little hillock. Son then you're in for a lashing. And if I hug her, you'll pay the bill. Or I'll pay. Fine? Okay. - Okay. Wait and watch. I have to go for shopping. You get the car. It is very important. What are you doing? I'm sorry. I'm blind. - He's blind. Dear, get up and take him to the toilet. Poor boy. He's blind. He's had it. Get dinner fast. Or I'll have to eat a punch. - Yes, sir. Thank you very much. What a lively boy. But he's blind. What a pity. Seeing them together I'm reminded of the film, 'Dosti' One chap is lame and the other blind. Who is blind? - That boy on that table. He's Akash Verma. He'll become anything to flirt with girls. Aman.. He fooled me! See how I'll teach him a lesson. Ladies and gentlemen. - What happened? - Just follow me. Come on. Forget business. Talk about home. About children. - My children are great. If one of my sons is a diamond, the other is the Kohinoor diamond! How do you differentiate between them? How do I tell them apart? Hear and decide for yourself. Take Aman for example. A turbulent mind becomes calm at seeing him. When he speaks it feels as if rose petals fall from his lips. Great! Then why don't you open a flower shop? I also want to start a shoe shop. No place. Shall I use your head? Don't be angry. The other son? Akash? - Yes, Akash. Akash will write the name of Varmas in the sky with light. He will add light to our family name. Help me. I'm blind. Why are you hitting a blind man? He's a dark horse. - Dark horse? I mean he'll run ahead of everybody. Why are you hitting me for a old woman? He'll keep running with the world behind him. He'll keep running so will people. Stop the car. I slipped. He's really running like a horse in a race. He's ahead with people behind him! Oh my god, don't hit me. Tomatoes instead of flowers. Stones instead of love! Sticks instead of reward! What about our family name? What happened to your family name? - Nothing. Get off the car. He's getting beating and I have to alight? Get off quickly! - How will I go home? Take a cab. - Cabs don't go there. Then take a rickshaw. - How will that go if cabs don't? Take your legs and go! How will I go home? I hold your legs. - Not on hire, out! What's wrong with him? He's getting beaten and I have to get off! Use your legs! I'm ashamed of your condition. Feel like drowning myself! Why are you sounding link a man? What is it? - What is it? You're on the phone when I'm scolding you!? Hang up! There's no respect! How did this tear? Why did you get beaten up? You won't understand. I'd gone for a fancy dress party. And those fools thought I was a beggar! Listen, do I really look that foolish? - Not that much. What? Why? Beggars are given charity, not beaten by tomatoes, eggs, stones! How do you know? - I was passing by. I saw you chased. Long live fathers of today! Didn't try to rescue me! - Me rescue you? So that people leave you and beat me up instead? Should have iced him there! - I'm not ice cream to be frozen!? - Shut up. I'll give you one! - The father within awakens! The one outside not within! - Dad.. Forgive him now. I promise you he'll never repeat it again. No. - Why? - I swear by my Dad I won't do it. Sure? - Sure. Must be Julie. You said you won't do such things. - Simply. This telephone is the reason he's getting spoilt! You're right. If I get this line cut all his lines will be cut! Ass! Donkey! Whatever I am, however I am, I am only your son. Very.. Hello, son. My business partner. My son Aman. We're building a big hotel in Ooty with him. The entire construction responsibility is yours. Me? The cold climate of Ooty has affected him. It's not that. I'm not sure whether I can handle it well... I am confident you will. - Okay, dad. When do I have to leave? - When does the flight leave? Tomorrow. - Is it your Pop's flight? It leaves on Monday. When will you reach? In 4 days. - Hello, everybody. My other son. Listen to me.. Why are you looking there? - I've seen him somewhere. In some party or restaurant. I'm the life of every party. I'm always followed by thousands. Yes, I got it. One in front followed by thousands! A dark... Let me say horse. - Doesn't sound nice from an ass. What are you doing here? Go home! First you say come to office, then you say go home! - Go away! Come here. Are you making fun of my son? Let your son do anything, I'll have it printed in the papers! I don't have a son. - Then who was in your house? The neighbour's son. - And that woman in your house? She is my wife. - Okay. Any problems? Go do your work. Laxmi will come to pick you up from the airport. He'll tell you the rest. Since when are you here? Last five years, sir. And before this? - I was in Elore. Vellore. - Ellore. How did you come here? - What happened... I once had a picture taken. The positive appeared negative. Something black. The photographer told me... You'll become an ape in Vellore. Do one thing, you go to hill station. You'll become white. - I see. Laxmi. - Yes, sir? Can you cook well? - Yes sir. My parents were good cooks. Even I make good food. Once you eat good cooked by me you'll lick your fingers. You cook very well. You should join a 5 star hotel. You're pulling my leg. Here, wash your hands. Is there any good market nearby? - Sure. Just 5 minutes away. What do you get there? - Shoes. What nonsense! - Listen to the rest. Shoes, clothes, fruits, everything. What do you want? - I want some books. Is there any book stall? - Book and stall too. The owner is incomparable. - What do you mean? Her name is Pooja but deeds otherwise. Hello, dear Pooja. - Hello, uncle. God bless you, dear. Are you responsible for everybody? - No. Then why did you pay the rent for Asha's shop? That gangster was troubling her. I thought you'd be happy we could help somebody. But I get scared when you start preaching to a hoodlum. You make a mountain out of a molehill. Pass me the books. I'll put them away. Here. - Give me soon. Take this. Do you have the latest Newsweek? - Sure. Come in. Mother! Pass the books. A little more space. She's much more beautiful than I imagined! Did you say something? - No. Just like that. I want some editions of poets. Ghalib, Taq, Momin, Firaq.. If you won't feel hurt may I say something? Everyone has his choice. But have you ever read Sagar's work? Who the hell is he? - Haven't you heard of him? He's a famous poet of these times. I'm sure you'll like his work. What can these poets of today write! They steal drops from the works of famous poets and become oceans! No knowledge of the sound of anklets yet write about it! Listen you! Aman Varma. - Mr. Aman Varma. I won't take it lightly if you speak one word against Sagar! What will you do? - I won't give these books. Looks like you... what's the poet's name? Sagar. - Yes, Sagar. Looks like you like him too much. Yes I do! None of your business! I mean you are flying off the handle for no reason. I take back my words. Now give me the books. If Sagar's new edition is included in this...? Then you'll even get a discount! How much is the bill after deducting the discount? Rupees 40 for the books, 10 as discount. That's 30. Seems new to our city. Looks like a stranger. - An interesting stranger. You don't know Sagar? He's a famous poet of these times. I'm sure you will like his work. Laxmi. - Yes, sir? I'm laughing, but why are you laughing? I'm laughing because you're laughing. It's great fun! Who the hell is it? Who is it? Hello? It's the door. It is fun. Who is it? - Somebody from Bombay for you. Come. Sit. Thank you. - What is he doing with this big telescope? When did you come? - This morning. How are mother, Dad, Akash? - Fine. They miss you. I too miss them. - Hope you have no problems here. Everything is fine. - If he has any problems, I'll sort it out. My name is... Laxmi Gundappa Chinnapa Kariyappa Lingaswamy. I have a very long name. Get some tea for him. - In a minute. Now who has come! There are some maps and papers in this. See them and try to understand. Welcome, sir. Good day sir. Come in and sit. Come in, sir. How can I serve you? Get me first class tea. - We don't serve it. Then do you serve third class tea? We serve no class of tea. We only have... ...Ram Pyari, Ram Dulari, Ram Bihari, Ram.. - Enough. Sir, there's Ram Kesri tea also. Does every tea here carry Ram's name? Yes. What is that sir? I'm Bajrangbali's devotee. You tell me whose devotee he was. Ram's. - Yes. That's why tea carries his name! So get me one Rampyari. Kaluva! - Yes, sir. Get one Rampyari for sir. Hurry up. - Right away, sir. Here you are, sir. Can I get a paper and pen? Sir, I'll get it right away. Here you are. One tea. - Get a tea for sir. Right away, sir. So back on the same path? To the same destination? Who are you? I'm your reflection, your conscience. What you want? I want to bring what's in your heart to your tongue. About what? That you love Pooja intensely. And that love for her has created a storm in your heart. And your heart has accepted her. You worshipped her and now she's the purpose of your life. You are right. I love her too much. I love her too much. Then why don't you tell her? Some day I will. I'll tell her I'm her Sagar! Have some sweets dear. What for? - Because my shop is doing very well. Really? How come? Thanks to you. - Thanks to me? A stranger comes to my shop everyday. And drinks 30-40 cups of tea by evening. How am I involved? - Actually his eyes are on your shop. Eyes here, tea there. Eyes here, tea there. And the total rupees 30.25. So this is the matter! Let that 30.25 come. I'll teach him such a lesson that he'll forget to drink tea! Then what about my business? Don't worry. Call me when he comes. That I'll do but keep the honor of these sweets. Lord! What difficulty have you gotten me into! What have I done! Ruined my own business! Lord! Save this foolish man! What difficulty have you gotten me into! Hello, sir. - Hello, Babulal. How are you? - The Lord is kind. Have a seat. Kaluva, the stranger has come! So what's the latest news? I've heard the weather outside is terrible! Dark clouds are gathering. Clouds are going to burst. Lightning is going to strike. There are chances of terrible rain! Great! Exceptional! Listen to what Sagar says. A picture is painted in my heart since ages. A picture is painted in my heart since ages. My destiny sits in the shade of your tresses. That book stall girl was right. A picture is painted in my heart since ages. A picture is painted in my heart since ages. My destiny sits in the shade of your tresses. Listen to what else he has written. As far as my vision.. I see only you, just you. I see you every moment. It's only the jeweler who knows the value of the diamond. I'm reciting Sagar's poems to you and you're not concentrating. I meant to ask which era did he write in? And where does he live? - In my own city. And because of that I do meet him. I see. - It's after coming here that I learnt he writes well. Didn't you know before that? That's a sign of greatness. They never proclaim their greatness. Sagar, you turned out to be deeper than the ocean! Now when I meet you, I'll kiss your hand and say.. What will you say? You are great! One fantastic Rampyari for him from me. Why the formality? - Because you know Sagar. You belong to the same city, you move in the same circles. And I'm his fan. But I don't understand one thing. If you know Sagar, why did you abuse him in my shop? I wanted to test the limits of your love. By the way how do you know him? - Through letters and his poems. Tell me something else about him. - Ask me something else about him. How does he look? - He's smart and young. Really? Can't you introduce me to him? Definitely but on one condition. Condition? - That you'll show me this beautiful place. Because I'm new to this area. Is that all? So it's a promise? - I promise. "I am indeed crazy at heart. I'm in love with you..." "I am indeed crazy at heart. I'm in love with you..." "but whenever I come across you..." "but whenever I come across you..." "I'm afraid to tell you." "O sweetheart, O beloved..." "O sweetheart, O beloved..." "I am indeed crazy at heart. I'm in love with you..." "I am indeed crazy at heart. I'm in love with you..." "I reason with my heart..." "I do my best to cajole it." "I reason with my heart..." "I do my best to cajole it." "But it's so naive, it won't understand..." "it makes me pine for you, through days and nights." "I am indeed crazy at heart. I'm in love with you..." "I am indeed crazy at heart. I'm in love with you..." "but whenever I come across you..." "but whenever I come across you..." "I'm afraid to tell you." "O sweetheart... O beloved." "O sweetheart... O beloved." "I am indeed crazy at heart. I'm in love with you..." "I am indeed crazy at heart. I'm in love with you..." "It torments me every moment..." "it keeps me awake, all night." "It torments me every moment..." "it keeps me awake, all night." "You wouldn't know..." "you are the only one I love with all my heart." "I am indeed crazy at heart. I'm in love with you..." "I am indeed crazy at heart. I'm in love with you..." "but whenever I come across you..." "but whenever I come across you..." "I'm afraid to tell you." "O sweetheart... O beloved." "O sweetheart... O beloved." "O sweetheart... O beloved." "O sweetheart... O beloved." Mother, this is Aman. He lives in Bombay. Hello! - God bless you. Have you come here for sight seeing? No, aunt. My Dad is constructing a hotel here. I'm here in that regard. What a fool I am! I forgot to tell you he knows Sagar very well. Now you're in deep trouble! I don't understand. - Neither do I. God knows why she is crazy for him! - Mom. Now she'll drive you mad talking about Sagar all the time! You've started off again! I'll show you our house. This is Billu's room. That's mother's room. And there's our prayer room. And that's the guest room. Come in. And this is my room. One minute! See the view from here. Everything looks so beautiful. Yes, it's truly beautiful. If Kashmir is heaven on earth, this place is our heaven! This place has made me forget heaven on earth! You're wondering why the frame is blank. This frame is waiting for Sagar's photograph. Your wait is over. Sagar has come in person. Hello, Aman here. - Pooja here. How did you think of me so early in the morning? To remind you of this evening. - Anything special? That's why I called. There's a grand show at Nehru Stadium this evening. I'm also taking part in it. Then I will definitely come. Don't be late. I'll be waiting. "You are a poet..." "I'm your couplet." "You are a poet..." "I'm your couplet." "You are my beloved..." "and I'm your sweetheart." "I long to meet you..." "I long to meet you..." "O sweetheart." "You are a poet..." "I'm your couplet." "You are my beloved..." "and I'm your sweetheart." "Every poem, every song of yours, I have memorised." "Every poem, every song of yours, I have memorised." "As long as I breathe, I will never forget you." "Without you, I don't want to live..." "I swear to you." "Without you, I don't want to live..." "I swear to you." "Without even meeting you or getting to know you..." "I've given away my heart." "You are my heart-throb..." "and I mean the life to you." "You are a poet..." "I'm your couplet." "I long to meet you..." "I long to meet you..." "O sweetheart." "You are a poet..." "I'm your couplet." "You are my beloved..." "and I'm your sweetheart." "How will I tell you how I pine for you?" "How will I tell you how I pine for you?" "How will I prove my undying love for you?" "There isn't a name on my lips, except yours, my love." "There isn't a name on my lips, except yours, my love." "You are the one who possesses my heart." "You're crazy..." "and I'm your obsession." "You are a poet..." "I'm your couplet." "I long to meet you..." "I long to meet you..." "O sweetheart." "You are a poet..." "I'm your couplet." "You are my beloved..." "and I'm your sweetheart." Pooja, the show was superb. I didn't know you dance so well. Forget it. I'm very happy today. The show went of better than... Veera...? I'm a poet and you're my poetry. That day you escaped my clutches. But who will rescue you today? Come on. - Let go! Get lost! Come on! Don't beat him! Aman! Don't beat him! Stop here. Police! Run! Catch them all! Don't let anyone escape! What were you doing here? What were you doing here? You know how helpless you are. Man protects woman. You can't look after yourself forget any girl! Had anything untoward happened you wouldn't ever forgive yourself! Excellent God! What justice you mete out! You snatched my parents as soon as I took birth. I said nothing. When I was able to walk, you gave me these crutches. I kept mum. From childhood to youth I had to cross many dark alleys. I had to bear loneliness. I bore everything. Do you know why? Because I'm accustomed to drinking this bitter truth! But when you made me realise this bitter truth in front of Pooja... I couldn't tolerate it. Today I realise it, dear God... I am truly an incomplete man! A cripple! Is this my fault? Is this my crime? Who made this incomplete man? It's you. Who has made me a joke in the eyes of the world? It's you. Answer me! Who brought me to this juncture of life? It's you. You! You are the culprit not me! You are at fault not me! For what crime are you punishing me? Answer me! Almighty, be praised. Let's go. I've found the answer to every question, my Lord. Forgive me. Good your plane didn't get derailed. Once I was going to America, the plane was delayed. Both stayed here. Quiet. Hope you didn't tell Aman I'm coming. How could I say when you told me not to tell him? You said so I didn't tell him. - Very good, Laxmi. But why the suspense? Anything that occurs suddenly has its' own pleasure. Aman and I will meet each other suddenly. Suddenly. - Suddenly. What happened suddenly, mamma mia! I think the tyre is punctured. How did this happen suddenly? Did you call me beautiful? Thank you, sir. You look after the tyre. I'll look after them. Sir, where are you going? Sir, where are you going? Excuse me. - What is it? Do you mind getting up? Get up. Walking like a blind bat! Tyre ready sir. Sir? He's got a flat! Sir. Sir! The ladies have gone. Let's go. "I wish to meet you, fall in love..." "and there's a promise to keep, my love." "I wish to meet you, fall in love..." "and there's a promise to keep, my love." "Should we unite, the world will watch our love in astonishment." "My love..." "sweetheart." "I wish to meet you, fall in love..." "and there's a promise to keep, my love." "Should we unite, the world will watch our love in astonishment." "My love..." "sweetheart." "I wish to meet you, fall in love..." "and there's a promise to keep, my love." "I'm no poet, I'm not crazy..." "I'm not a Romeo, I'm not a firefly." "I'm no poet, I'm not crazy..." "I'm not a Romeo, I'm not a firefly." "But ever since I have met your gaze..." "my love..." "But ever since I have met your gaze..." "my love..." "I've gone crazy..." "I've gone crazy..." "I don't know what I'm going to face, my love." "I wish to meet you, fall in love..." "and there's a promise to keep, my love." "I wish to meet you, fall in love..." "and there's a promise to keep, my love." "Who knows when we might meet again." "Who know when I will pour my heart out to the beautiful one." "Who knows when we might meet again." "Who know when I will pour my heart out to the beautiful one." "A beauty like her..." "I have never seen." "How will the world stop me? I have decided..." "I'm going to make her belong to me." "I wish to meet you, fall in love..." "and there's a promise to keep, my love." "Should we unite, the world will watch our love in astonishment." "My love..." "sweetheart." "I wish to meet you, fall in love..." "and there's a promise to keep, my love." What a girl she was! Careful. She was gorgeous. Love at first sight. She's my first love. You're in love again! She was terrific from head to toe! She wounded this friend of yours with one look! She wounded you? - Yes. You! Hardly saw the girl and already wounded? You feel joking. I'm 100% serious. In my shoes you too would be wounded! Really? - Yes. How do I describe her? She's the first ray of the sun! What happens to the second, third and fourth rays? Them? They'll get a complex on seeing her and hide behind clouds. And this? - Don't ask pal! She entered my heart through the windows of the eyes. Is that a heart or a traffic light? The eye blinks later but the signal comes first. Careful. There might be an accident. It had to take place and it has! Now I wait for the day.. When I will see her. Later. First let's eat dinner. Come on. You're not interested in my love story! "Give me a kiss, O mother." "A kiss, O mother." "A kiss, O mother." Where is Akash? - He himself doesn't know that. What do you mean? - I mean he doesn't eat or drink. No manners to sleep either! Honestly his condition is very dangerous. "Give me a kiss." "Akash." You're standing here. And I've searched the whole house! Why are you looking like a Romeo? You neither eat nor drink on time nor do you come to the site. What has happen to you? I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't like anything. Only one thing bothers me. Where do I find her? Don't you feel sorry for me? A little. - Help me find her. Help you find her? Are you nuts? Please, pal. All right. Be ready in the morning. - Really? Akash. Where are you? Get up! Have you found her? - Do you see her night and day? Harvest your beard and get dressed. Lalchand was asking about you. Even Dad called up. Get on line before a warrant is issued in your name. Do I have to come? - Yes, you have to! Pooja is here to meet you. She's waiting in the hall. Come down quickly. I'll be downstairs. Okay. - Good morning, sir. Who is Pooja? - The owner of Popular Book Store. Aman sir buys books from her. A girl? Aman with a girl? Can't get it. Aman buying books. Get it? What you talking? I can't understand. Then try and understand. Leave it to me. - Yes, sir. Go to the kitchen and make me breakfast. Get it or do I have to explain? Yes, sir. - Yes, sir? - No, sir. - No, sir? Better I go, sir. - Better you go, sir. How did you come by? - Nothing special. You didn't turn up after the show. Mother too was worried. Even I wondered what the matter was. I couldn't come as I was busy. Tell her soon I'll come to see her. She has sent carrot pudding for you. Thank her on my behalf. See you. It's time to open the shop. I forgot to tell you one thing. Sagar's new book has arrived. You'll get it at a discount. "This heart has made me crazy." "You are falling in love with me." "I'm falling in love with you." "I'm falling in love with you." Akash. What happened to him? Laxmi, get some water! What happened to him? Here's some water. Found her! - Found whom? The one who stole my sleep, my peace! But where did you see her here? Don't ask the story of my love! The one I searched all over town, was found in my own backyard! What's wrong with him? - But who is she? The one who's just come home. Who? Pooja! Pooja? She's the girl I was searching for! The queen of my dreams. My heart throb! If I get her, my life will change. Is she the same girl? Did you recognise her? My eyes don't deceive me. How can I forget the face that made me forget myself? I swear by you I can never forget her! Perceive the target of the arrow. Lightning struck there but my nest was destroyed! The ship of hope was almost ashore. Time! Did the storm have to hit now? You gave new life to my words. She's the first ray of sunlight. I can't live without her! Only you can diminish the distance between us. I need your help. There was only one ray of light in my dark life. Pooja, I love her very much. My foot wouldn't come near you! Have you ever seen your face? I became victim to a bet. Somebody can give you pity but not love! Cripple! For the sake of friendship I will sacrifice my love. Pooja will only belong to Akash! "How will I ever live..." "without you?" "How will I ever live..." "without you?" "My heart likes nothing..." "without you." "How will I ever live..." "without you?" "How will I ever live..." "without you?" "How will I tell you what life without you will be?" "How will I tell you what life without you will be?" "It'll be a curse, a punishment." "It'll be a curse, a punishment." "I have made up my mind..." "I am going to live without you." "How will I ever live..." You're standing here. I looked for you all over. I've made one decision. To attain Pooja, I'm willing to do anything, scale any heights. She is not that type of girl. I know her quite well. She loves a poet whom she has never seen. Who is that fortunate man? His name is Sagar. And he lives in Bombay. Through letters, she gave him her heart. Then what do I do? What happens to me? There is one way. To win her love, you must pretend to be him. What do you mean? - I mean you must become Sagar. No, I can't do this! You just said, you'd do anything. That doesn't mean I'll become Sagar! Would it be right to reach the peak of love through fraudulent means? Maybe you've forgotten that Lord Krishna said in the Geeta... If a lie helps somebody, it's better than a 1000 truths. And then you are smart, handsome, and belong to a rich family. If you come into her life, her life will change. God knows what kind of a man Sagar is. What if he is lame or cripple like me? I don't like this kind of joke! We'll talk about it later. But do you agree with my decision? What do you say? - Yes. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Pooja. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday Pooja. - Thank you. Today I'm going to give you the gift you've been wanting for years. Do you recall I once made you a promise? That I'd introduce you to Sagar someday? Friends today I wish to present my friend, a famous poet to you. He will sing his own composition before you. Thank you. "I love you so dearly, my love." "I love you so dearly, my love." "I could swear to it..." "I could even swear it on God." "I love you so dearly, my love." "You are the one I desire every moment." "You are the one I desire every moment." "You do not know how I pine for you, my love." "When I meet you..." "When I meet you..." "I will tell you, my love." "I love you so dearly, my love." "I love you so dearly, my love." "I could swear to it..." "I could swear to it..." "I could even swear it on God." "I love you so dearly, my love." "I love you so dearly, my love." You? - Yes the same blind bat. Why didn't you tell me then that you were Sagar? If you had time to get up, then I'd tell you. Shall we go home? Meet him. He's Sagar. She's my friend Renu. Sagar is the name I write poems with. My name is Akash Verma. Pleased to meet you. So am I but very little. - Why? Because she's the most happy. She'd talk of you night and day. You have to be naughty! Let's go home. - Pooja. I'll wait for you in Garden Court tomorrow evening at 6. Please come. Okay? Excuse me. Water. Excuse me. Please, eat. Why? Excuse me. What's the time? The best time to romance. Don't disturb me. Not your fault. In your shoes I probably would do the same. Water, sir. - Thank you. Keep a jug here. - Yes, sir. - Thank you. What's wrong? - Nothing. Either that man is born thirsty or he comes from a desert! When will she come? She will come. Positively. She won't go anywhere without coming here. What's his problem? Nothing. The thing is, about 4 years ago his beloved promised to meet him here. But she never turned up Initially he's drink water like you. Now he drinks liquor. I hope I don't turn to be like him! There he is. Go. - I'm nervous! I get you. Your aim is there. Now I'm off! Come with me. - Why? I'm scared. My heart is beating. It's running faster than the Rajdhani. I'm going. - Where are you going? - You're very cruel! I'm dying of fright and you're cracking jokes! In the field of love.. ...beauty and love have to confront each other alone. Just jump in! - No! - Go! "I see love in my beloved's eyes." "I see love in my beloved's eyes." "It's now that my heart finds its peace." "How I have pined to meet you, my love..." "It's now that my heart finds its peace." "I see love in my beloved's eyes." "It's now that my heart finds its peace." "I will lower my gaze, I will give you a place in my heart..." "without you, I cannot find peace anywhere." "I will lower my gaze, I will give you a place in my heart..." "without you, I cannot find peace anywhere." "You are my heart..." "you are my sight..." "you are the one I desire..." "you are my companion." "I see love in my beloved's eyes." "It's now that my heart finds its peace." "My charms, my youth..." "it's all for you... that includes my life too." "My charms, my youth..." "it's all for you... that includes my life too." "You are my poem..." "you are my melody." "To your heart..." "let me give the story of our love." "I see love in my beloved's eyes." "I see love in my beloved's eyes." "It's now that my heart finds its peace." "How I have pined to meet you, my love..." "It's now that my heart finds its peace." "I see love in my beloved's eyes." Aman! Hi, Aman. - Hi Pooja, what a pleasant surprise. Come in and sit. Laxmi. - Yes, sir? Get 3 coffees quick. - In a minute. Are you so busy these days that you have no time for friends? That's not true. Destiny reminds me... - Of what? On page 26 of Diwane-Sagar, you've written a couplet on fate. Please, tell it. Couplet on fate? - Yes. - In Diwane-Sagar? - Yes. Page 26? - Yes. It is impossible. It can't be. Yes it is on page 26! You are mistaken. It is impossible! Mistaken? I? I remember every word that you've ever written! Why argue on the page? Just recite the couplet. Remember? - Yes. Yes, it is on fate. Hot coffee. Sir coffee for you. - Destiny! Destiny. Yes, Amitabh Bachhan's film! I'm going in. Have coffee. Get out! Destiny. What's wrong? Why is the needle of your voice stuck at this poem? Actually... it's my voice... Stupid you recited those lines to me this morning. Have you forgotten? My Maker, you left no stone unturned. My Maker, you left no stone unturned. Ultimately each man gets what's in his fate. This was the one. How surprising! You wrote these lines but he remembers it. I can't help it. Since I saw you.. ...I've forgotten myself not just poems. It's very late. I must leave. I'll drop her home. Do come home soon as you have time. Bye. - Okay, bye. My Maker, you left no stone unturned. My Maker, you left no stone unturned. Ultimately each man gets what's in his fate. Today I was saved by the skin of my teeth! If you hadn't recited the poem, my cover would have been blown! This Sagar has made my life hell! We'll have to do something about him. Idea. - What? Let's ask some gangster to knock him off! Why get involved? As it is he's a heart patient. You mean one leg in the grave and one on the banana peel? Assume it. I'm off to Bombay. - Why? To push the other foot in the grave. You've got Pooja's love due to him. Then what do we do about this rascal? You'll have to memorise all his poems. I'll give you the books. Will I have to do this too? - People gave their lives for love. You can't learn some poems? Come on. - Let's go. When I hear a footfall, I feel it is you. When the breeze lilts, I feel it is you. Lovely! When I hear a footfall, I feel it is you. When the breeze lilts, I feel it is you. When some bough shyly bends low... I feel it is you. Wow! - Oh God. It's a question of love. When some bough shyly bends low... I feel it is you. What a beautiful couplet! Listen, I've memorised another! Good grief! He's coming! When the breeze lilts, I feel it is you. Aman, listen to me. Listen if I've learnt it well. Aman, get up. Get up! Listen! Let me sleep. I'm very sleepy. Let me sleep. You learn poems all night, I'll hear them in the morning. You make me a poet, keep me awake at nights. You sleep making excuses! Isn't this a poem? - Let me sleep. Thank God, he left. I don't understand where to draw the line. What a shade of love! - What do you mean? Her love has made you quite responsible. Trunk call from Bombay. Dad has called. Hello, is this Aman? - Yes, dad. How are you? - Fine and you and mom? Very well. How's the work progressing? Going on. - How is Akash the trouble maker? Helping with the work. Here, talk to him. Hello Daddy, how are you? How is mom? Forget about me. What about you? - Don't worry about me. My work is my worship (Pooja) and worship is my work! Good! That's what I except from you .. ...Let me know if there's any problem. Okay, bye dad. The one you thought was useless is working hard. Work is worship he says. After all he's my son! - That's the sad part. Sad part? - Feel proud of him! I know him well! He must have found a girl to go around with! That must be his work! - Why do you scare me? Akash won't go wrong till he's with Aman. Staying with him someday he'll learn his responsibility. I pray to God that they remain bound in friendship forever. Absolutely. - Nothing should ever separate them. Pray from my side too. - Why can't you do that? He won't listen to me. - Because you're Akash' Dad? No because I'm his mom's husband. Go. - Bye. What was so urgent that you couldn't tell me over the phone? And called me here? I need your help to solve a problem. How do I tell you? One coffee. What will you have? Gold spot. - Gold spot. Akash! Hi. What a pleasant surprise! How did you come here? I'm staying in Hotel Skyrow with friends. You left without telling me. I have so many fans. Can't tell everyone where I'm going! By the way, she is Pooja. Pooja, she's Menaka and Menaka, she is Pooja. Lovely toy to while time. Anyways, come and meet my friends. Go ahead... - Come on. This is Aarti, Meena, and Shanti. - Hello. - Hello. He's Akash. - Bye, Pooja. - Akash? Listen to me. - I don't want to! Listen to me. - Don't you dare touch me! Who was that girl? She was Menaka. - Whether Menaka or Suparnakha, who was she to you? Your niece, aunt? - She was my fan. Fan? If she's a fan she should hang from the ceiling not your neck! How do I explain to you? - There's no need! I know everything. All men are alike! See a girl and there they go! Really! There's a limit to suspicion! I wanted you to solve my problem. Instead you've created a problem! What could be your problem? - I'll tell you if you sit in peace. Yes? - I have a good friend. He loves a girl so much that he used another name to attain her. Another man's name? Why? Because that was the only way he could get her. So what's the problem? - Now he is scared. If she finds out the truth, she'll neither love nor respect him. Tell me what should he do? I think your friend should tell the girl the truth. Does your friend really love her? Yes. - So does the girl? She does. - Then she will be his! Then I'll write to him today itself. You might not forgive me after reading this letter. I have deceived you. I set out to build a castle of sand .. ...but I forgot the waves would erase it. I'm that unfortunate man who in spite of having his own identity.. To make place in his beloved's heart.. He took the support of another name. I'm Akash, not Sagar. Akash Varma. "Don't get angry after reading my love letter." Where are you going? - To give Akash' letter to Pooja. Give it to me. I'll give it. Thank you, sir. I'm off to meet my beloved. After much deliberation, I've reached a decision. After marriage a wife has to perform many duties. For example, looking after the house, scrubbing the dishes... If you're willing to do all this, I'm willing to marry you! Quickly answer me if these conditions are acceptable. I accept. It is accepted! It is accepted! It is accepted! - Mom Dad... What are you saying? Young man... - You're talking in Dad's voice! Listen to me. What is accepted? - You didn't tell me... Has he caught my childhood habit of stammering? What do you want to say? It got passed. - Who? The lender. - The lender? - No, the tender. You didn't tell them. You sent the tender this morning. Yes, I forgot to tell you. Very good! A friend should be like you! You hid your friend's fault so well. There is no limit to this rascal's mistakes! How long will you cover up? He... - Enough. She chewed my brains at home My eyes are pining to see the boys. God knows what they eat! Each day is like a decade! My darlings! My precious! She was worried for you. Why are you laughing? Am I holding your face? No, I'm enjoying it. - Shut up. Honestly the house seems so lonely without both of you. The house is so quiet. - House? The city is quiet! The city? - Yes. There's a wanted poster for you. Demanded reward for finder. What have I done that people are searching for me? Who's looking? I'd tell you if it was one. Every tall, short, fat, thin... Coming, going, every girl is looking through binoculars for you! I've given that up. But why is he laughing? Feed him and shut him up! Don't you remember something seeing these hills, this cool breeze? What? When we came here for our honeymoon after we got married... We'd lie under the blanket and talk sweet little nothings. Can't they be repeated? - No! Why not? - Have shame for this grey hair! When I had no shame for black, why should I feel shy from grey hair? Because these are not our times. Time belongs to our kids. Do they take birth in planes? How did their time come so fast? Do you see what I see? Yes. - There not here! Come with me. - I don't understand... There's something fishy. - Where's the fish? This fish is going to be fried in our kitchen! Come with me. Akash! Where is everybody? Who are you? We... are... - Thieves? Aren't you ashamed to be stealing at this age? Do we look like thieves? - They wear good clothes these days! Who can trust them? - But child... Child? - Where are you looking? You.. No shame to call me child? - Since when do you know Akash? What's your concern? Who are you to ask me? My parents. - What? - My parents. What is it? What are you staring at? Why don't you say something? Had I not caught them, they'd have wiped the house clean! They are my parents. - They maybe your par... What did you say? Mom.. - Dad. Halt. About turn. Forward march. Stop! So we look like thieves in these clothes? No. Please forgive me. Everybody can make mistakes. The young, old, she, you.. Halt. You ask the next question. Since when do you know him? - Since I came here... Quiet. What's your name? Pooja. You look this way. What do you do? - I run a book stall. Who lives with you? - My mother, little brother. And? - I'm a graduate. And? - Pooja, when did you come? Is everything all right? Oh! So you are part of this conspiracy? Come here. - Mother.. - Come here. After listening to all the witnesses.. This court has reached this decision.. The accused has committed .. ...the grave sin of falling in love with Akash. Hence this court sentences the accused... ...to be tied together in the bond of marriage for life! The court's feet maybe touched. Quickly. Where are you going? - To get married. Slap you? Come here. What are you looking at? - When will she come home? You are responsible for the completion of this noble deed. You know how much Akash and Pooja love each other. I know. But I also know Akash is a millionaire's son. I fear that this wall of poverty and riches... The ones who gave an orphan place in their hearts, brought me here... Wealth, richness, poverty has no meaning for them. Pooja will reign like a queen. Dad will pamper her to the hilt. Mother will protect her with her maternal love. And Akash will keep her in the sky! Enough, son. Anybody who has a son like you.. ...as their identity needs no other proof. I accept this proposal. By accepting you've kept my word. I'll take leave. - Have a sweet. No, I'll have it with Dad and Mom. They must be anxious to hear the good news. Okay, son. - Goodbye. Aman. - Pooja. I'd forgotten the key. I came for it. I don't know how we are related. I don't know what to call this relation. Some relations are better off with no name. Come, dear. Wear these dear. They are a sign of our family tradition. They are given to the bride of the house. They are yours now. God bless you, dear. First I'll go look for that priest. - Which one? The one who finishes the wedding rites soon after taking a bribe. You bribed him? Could we ever have got married if I hadn't done that? We could never get married. Shut up! Take it. Aman! What is it? - Come home early today. - Why? Always questions me! I've booked 3 tickets for this evening... 3 tickets? You, me and Pooja. - No. You go. Why? - The architect is coming home this evening. We have a meeting. I can't come. Okay, listen to me. Why are you working so hard? - I'll see you in the evening. Okay, I'm going. Work hard. I'm going. Bye, see you! Friends, I'm grateful to you that you called me once again. Tonight I'm singing for you a song composed by a young upcoming poet. I'm confident that you will like Sagar's new composition. I present Sagar's composition. "How will I ever live..." "without you?" "How will I ever live..." "without you?" "My heart likes nothing..." "without you." "How will I ever live..." "without you?" "How will I ever live..." "without you?" "How will I tell you what life without you will be?" "How will I tell you what life without you will be?" "It'll be a curse, a punishment." "It'll be a curse, a punishment." "I have made up my mind..." "I will not live without you." "How will I ever live..." "without you?" "How will I ever live..." "without you?" "My heart likes nothing..." "without you." "How will I ever live..." "without you?" "How will I ever live..." "without you?" Pankaj-bhai! That's splendid! The Goddess of wealth comes to Laxmi. Nobody is watching. Put it in. Oh God. 25 paise! Even a beggar doesn't accept it these days. But I do. I don't refuse wealth. The greatest thing is cash! Too much greed is bad. Akash sir. I found a 50 rupee note in your pant. Keep it. - Better to ask and keep. Where is Aman? - Aman got dressed and left early morning. 5 paise? Money grows in this trouser and reduces in this one! It is not good. This seems to have a lot of cash! This looks like the ticket to a show. That too used! I don't want it. Let it be. All the money got over. - Where did you find it? - In Aman's trousers. Akash, Aman. - Wouldn't he come with me if he wanted to? I just saw him there. - You imagined it. The architect is coming home tonight. We have a meeting. You go ahead. I can't come. Why did he lie to me? What's the reason? Why does he stay away from me? Can't understand it. Can't understand it. The weather is pretty bad today. Close the shop and go home early. Just going uncle. Okay. Kaluva, give tea to sir and close the shop. What are both of you doing there? You'll get wet. Come in here. Tea tastes terrific in rains. Come dear. Come! Let's go, Akash. - Come on. Sit my dear. Sir you too. Kaluva. - Yes, sir. Get 2 teas. Quick. What's wrong? - Nothing. Are you feeling all right? The stranger is not seen these days. Has he gone back? - No. Whom is he talking about? - Aman. Does he know him? - I can forget the whole world. But not him. He'd often come here and kill time. And add on to my business! How is that? - Tea here, eyes there. And the bill would be 30.25. Isn't that right dear? Why are you laughing? When I heard about this... I came here to pull his ears. Then he spoke about you. That you belong to his town. He meets you daily. And my anger dissipated. And he talked about you right here. And promised to introduce you to me. Why would Aman sit here and watch Pooja's shop? As far as I know, Aman does not know any poet named Sagar. And if he did, he'd never hide this fact from his best friend! What happened? - I have to go. Let the rain stop. - It's already very late. If it gets any later, it will be terrible! Dear Sagar Sir, Hello. Let me introduce myself. I am Pooja. I study in Wilson College in Ooty. And I'm a fan of your poetry which I often read to my friends. When they appreciate it, my heart dances with joy. You are the true recipient of the fame I earn by singing your songs. Because the poem was one of yours. Sending a cutting of the picture of me with the prize.. ...Come here. Aman Sir alias Sagar, greetings from Anees. Congratulations on your success. Your new novel Toofane-Sagar is a resounding success. I send its' royalty to Father D'mello's school on time. Your partner in secret, Anees. Maybe you'll never forgive me after knowing the truth. Then forget me as a dream. And if you forgive me, I'll assume you accept my love. Now I understand why Pooja kept thinking I'm Sagar. You murdered your friend's love! You poisoned your friend's life! You are a blur in the name of friendship. That blur can't be erased by God! No! Waiter. - Yes, sir? Keep the bottle here. - No, you've had enough. Do as I say. Keep the bottle here. Okay, sir. Johnny Walker, black label. Waiter. - Yes, sir? Tell me one thing. Does this bottle contain the same liquor that the label shows? Definitely. But if the label was different from the liquor inside it...? How can that be possible? It is not but if it is? - It would be cheating. Cheating! How wonderful! This is cheating friend. The label is different. The wine in it is different. The one drinking is in the dark. The one giving it is in the dark. The maker is a cheat. Why did you do this? Why did you do this? Why did you do this? What's wrong with him? - Akash. Akash. What a state you're in! - You? What's wrong with you? - What's wrong with me? Just a mix-up of labels. Careful. - Look at this, I came for its' support. But it let me down. - Let's go. "I love you." Who is it? - It's me. I thought it was Akash. He's a colourful man. He must be enjoying somewhere. Why are you ruining you sleep? Eat dinner and go to bed. I'll wait for Akash. But sir, Akash. I said I'd wait. I'm used to it. You go and sleep. Good night, sir. What happened? Where were you? Are you all right? Now I'm fine. But what's wrong? - Cheating. Cheating? - Yes. Who knows for the love of what he kept serving me unlabeled wine. I got intoxicated. In my shoes, anybody would be in this state. Wrong label, cheating... What is all this? Why? The answer to that is in my eyes. When you read my eyes, you'll find the answer yourself. What do you want me to read in your eyes? You are still intoxicated. Look at your clothes? Why do you do all this? Do you know I haven't slept all night worrying about you? I called up everywhere. Pooja too didn't know where you were. Just tell me where you were stuck. The place where I should probably remain stuck forever! Are you the same Akash? No, I am not him. Because the clouds over the sky have dispersed. And I can see everything clearly in the strewing sun light. I don't believe my own eyes but I did see it. They were behaving like lovers. Hello? Who is it? Chameli? - Pooja here. Pooja? - Yes. Can I speak to Akash? - He isn't home. Where has he gone? - Don't know. Didn't tell me. And Aman? - He's gone to the site. I always swam but it's great fun swimming with you. Your talks are more intoxicating than you! Talking to you gives me a high. What's wrong? You change colours like a chameleon. You were so romantic now and the mood has gone? What's wrong? Go to the room. I'll join you. Forgive me Pooja. Forgive me Pooja. No! I'll never forgive you! Cheater! Did you have to play with my life? I hate you! Pooja? - You were right but I still can't believe it! Sagar can't be like this! Sagar can't be like this! Pooja, be brave. No Renu, I am shattered! Please, Pooja. Hello? - Hello, Aman here. May I talk to Pooja? One minute. Pooja. It's Aman on the line. Hello? - Hello Pooja, Aman here. Did you meet Akash? No. - Why didn't you? There's no need now. Hello Pooja? "Give me poison..." "I will drink it with a smile." "Give me poison..." "I will drink it with a smile." "I shall bear every sorrow, I will live in every condition." "I shall bear every sorrow, I will live in every condition." "The pain of separation, I will not be able to bear..." "without you, I will not be able to live." "How will I ever live..." "without you?" "How will I ever live..." "without you?" "The way you lowered your gaze when you saw me..." "The way you lowered your gaze when you saw me..." "I remember so much your lovely smile." "I remember so much your lovely smile." "How will I ever forget all those things...?" "those sweet nights, those meetings?" "How will I ever live..." "without you?" "How will I ever live..." "without you?" "My heart likes nothing..." "without you." "How will I ever live..." "without you?" "How will I ever live..." "without you?" It's more difficult to pretend to love than to hate somebody. Not only are you deceiving me but also Pooja and yourself. Deception? - Deception! Can you tell me my importance in your life? What do you think of me? A mere pawn in your game of love? Whom you can use as and when you please! The one who is a pawn in life's hands... ...can't treat any one as a pawn! By your behaviour you are shaming yourself in Pooja's and my eyes. Why do you want to use one woman against another? Why? Are you so depraved that you are not worthy of anyone's love? Yes, I've fallen in my own eyes! I'm that conman who borrows some one's name and attacks him! My life is in such a mess that anybody trying to untangle it... ...will get knotted up like you. Leave me alone. Go. Go. Just leave me alone. You may never have considered me your friend. But I always treated you so. When the ache in the heart increases man drowns in it and dies. If not love, we can share pain. I wish you could understand. Wear these. They belong to our family. They are given to the bride who comes to our house. Now on they are yours. I've noticed for some days you are always lost. What is the matter? Nothing at all. Everything is fine. It isn't. You may hide your pain from the world. But not from your mother. Because this relation of pain began at that point... ...when I gave birth to you. Mom. Who can understand your pain better than me? Take a hold on yourself. Everything will be all right. We were having such fun inside. Why did you come out here? I don't enjoy anything these days. Excellent. What a wonderful way to romance. The same old trick. Neither have you changed nor has your love. Only the faces changed. The heart broke. But you stayed in your place. One should learn romance from you. Isn't she your fan from Bombay? Fan? What is she saying? - Her only fault is... She is too innocent. I told her a small lie. That I'm her Sagar. And she believed it. I hate you! - If you don't believe me... Go and ask Aman Verma. No, he can't do this! If he won't can I do it? Go and ask him. He's done it. Go, I'm not your Sagar. Keep this. May come handy. Pooja. - No, don't stop her. She's going to meet her Sagar. Who is it? Pooja, you! Even nature is with you today. At least you can hide your face in the dark! Maybe you wouldn't be able to meet my eyes in the light. But... - I revealed my heart to you. I thought you were a good friend, my confidante. I admired you and your friendship. But you let down my trust! What a response you gave to my friendship! I kept getting cheated and you quietly watched the show! Not only watched, you auctioned my love in the market place! What gave you the right to bring your loafer friend in to my life? Treated me like a toy.. ...played when you felt like it and then discarded! Why did you do this? What did you get by lying? Your rich friend's applause? To whom you are obligated for life! Or an interesting story to spice up your lonely life? Tell me why did you do this? Why did you do this? Aman is my Sagar! Aman! Akash! Wait. You all go out. I'll check this out. You too. What's the matter? What's the problem? You are pretending to be innocent despite knowing everything. You are asking me what's the problem? Aren't you ashamed to play with Pooja's life? Had she ever harmed you? I thought a storm had approached! Had it been a storm, it would have abated. But you have wrought havoc. Relax. You know very well how many Pooja's entered and exited from my life. In any case when love becomes binding, I break it off! Is that why whatever you did so far was a lie, a deception? Was the claim to love Pooja a drama? Convincing me that you loved her.. Was that too a pretense? Fulfilling Dad and Mom's dream was that too a pretense? Sending a proposal to her mother was that too a pretense? Yes, it was all a pretense! - Akash! Very good! Today your hand caught your friend's collar! For one Pooja? What is special about her that caused a crack in our friendship? What is special in her that a wall came up between us? What's special about her.. ...that made you forget our childhood friendship? Friendship! Friendship! I accept that because of your.. ...friendship, I achieved name, fame, love and respect! But I too possess something. My conscience, my self respect. This vile act of yours has shamed me in her eyes... I hate myself because of it! My conscience reproaches me! This is all because of you! I've been made to stand in the bar of suspicion and disgrace! This is all because of you! If I knew I would have to face this day for your friendship... I would never have made any move to make you my friend! Which friendship are you talking about? There were no secrets between us. We were such good friends who would even die for each other! Then why did you keep this secret from me? Answer me! Didn't you trust me? Or did you think I'd break down or be destroyed if I find out? No, Akash Verma is not so weak! What secret? The secret that wrought a storm in our lives! Why don't you say you love Pooja? Do you have any answer to this? Why didn't you let me reveal the truth to her? ...That I'm not her Sagar? Do you have any answer to this? Why didn't you tell her you're Sagar? Have any answer to this? No. I have the answer! You always wanted to see me happy. You wanted to fulfil Mom and Dad's dreams .. ...so you sacrificed your love! But you never thought the strategy .. ...you implemented would trap 3 lives! Mine, Pooja's and your's! Abhimanyu couldn't come out of that impregnable battle array. But I had to break Pooja's heart to get out of your strategy. Do you still deny this truth? Why don't you own up that you are Sagar? Yes I am Sagar! I'm the unlucky Sagar who despite loving Pooja couldn't it to her! But when I discovered that you too love Pooja.. I cremated my desires, my dreams in my heart! Right from childhood, joys and sorrows played hide and seek with me. But sorrows were miles away from you. If you hadn't got Pooja's love, you wouldn't have got over it. That is why I decided to sacrifice my love .. ...at the altar of friendship. Aman.. My happiness lies in yours. I am dependant on these crutches for every step I take in life. How could I support anybody? I am indebted to you for life. Do me one last favour. For the sake of my friendship. Accept Pooja. Beautiful! Hats off to your friendship! One should learn about friendship from both of you! Aman, you wanted to turn great in your pal's eyes. So you did. By sacrificing your love. And you're the limit of sacrifice! By returning Aman's love to him. But both of you forgot to think of what would happen to me! Crushed between the sacrifices of both you great friends! My love is not a toy that you can gift anybody when you feel like it! I have my wishes, my loves. How easily you gave your decision. You never thought what I would go through when I found the truth. She'll fall in her own eyes! She won't do justice to herself or Akash! Just once you should have said, you were my Sagar! I'd give up everything for you. For men love is similar to turning the page of emotions. But it means her entire history for a woman! And I did not give anyone the right to rewrite my history! Pooja. You don't know how much Aman loves me. He has shared every happiness with me from childhood to date. He forgot that one thing in this world can't be shared, your love. The love of your beloved. If you reject his love today, you'll regret it all your life! And you'll be able to do nothing when it's too late! You won't be able to mend matters! You wouldn't ever get over it, if you hadn't got Pooja's love. And so I decided to sacrifice my love at the altar of friendship! See how pretty this is. - No, not that one. See how is this? Very pretty, beautiful. You'll look gorgeous when you wear it. When will you learn something? When you do. - What? I mean, your taste is excellent. - I've always had good taste. You realised it very late. - I don't mean you. Did I say you're referring me? Hi, mom. - Hi, Akash. Hello, dad. - Hi. When did you arrive? - Just now. No intimation... - Missed you so I just came. Thank God he thought of us! Here, look after this. Pass me those saris. See these. They are for Pooja. Won't she look pretty in these? She'll look like a fairy in these. A woman knows a woman's choice better. I'm exhausted mother. I'll sleep for awhile. Okay, go to sleep. Akash. - Yes? You can fool your mother not me. Shall I say something? If something is weighing down the heart, say it. The weight turns to words and evaporates from the tongue. I have always given in to you. I have done whatever you wanted. Not as a father but as a friend. Because I always want to see this face smiling. Then why the tears in these eyes? Daddy, at times one is so happy that joy turns to tears. And overflows from the eyes. You are lying! - No Daddy. You once said life is a gamble. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But in this game I have won and I have lost! This house will be decorated like a bride. Wedding bands will play. When the procession leaves.. People will say Rajiv Verma's son wedding procession is really grand! Aman's wedding procession. Aman's? - Yes mother. He wanted to repay our obligations. Pooja loves Sagar and Aman is Sagar. And I am just... You... proved to be very courageous! I am proud of you son! - Me too. Aman. - Akash. How did you come here? I've brought Pooja. To unite her with her beloved. "I love you very much." "I love you very much." "I can swear.. ...by the God." "I love you very much." "I love you very much."
