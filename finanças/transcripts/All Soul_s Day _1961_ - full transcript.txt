ALL SAINTS' EVE Starring Director of Photography Written and Directed by Walls, streets... Every day I see everything the same... Everything chases me away from here, everything keeps me on the same spot. I know, nothing can be altered - Paris, Rome, or London. The cities must look with your eyes. Their lights will not blind me, their noise will not drown me. And in the canals of Venice the water will be black. Oh, from there the last cry, which I hide in my throat... Will cross the Adriatic on a cloud to you. I will go, I will, by train, by ship... There is so much space on sea and on land, so many cities... O, be cursed you all for me... I feel so bad without you everywhere... And I feel so bad with you as well. And this completes our broadcast "Poems we like". And now it is time for a musical quarter. It's raining. - It will rain like this for a few days. - It always rain at this time of year. - Do you know this town? - I don't. - But I can go and ask... - Later on I will take it all upon myself. - Oh, you are... - I will wait. You will get wet. I won't. Go now, let's not waste time. The season is over. No one has a room prepared for renting. I asked everywhere but - ... they don't want to rent. - What now? I heard that there was a small hotel here. - A hotel? - Why not? You know, we would need to register. So what? I can... Let's go then. We have a free room! - Come on! - And the registration? Everything is arranged. Take our luggage or it will all get soaked through. Mr Heniutek. Mr Heniutek is very kind. Take this room, in the others there are five beds in each. Thank you so much. We will get breakfast in the morning, won't we? Why not... OK. So here we are. At last. What will happen now? What will be will be. Aren't you nervous anymore? Not at all. I'm not. I need to clean up. Look, there is no water in the jug. I will unpack everything. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Good afternoon, I would like to ask for some water. Oh, that Heniutek, Heniutek... Give me the jug. You arrived so late for holidays? It just happened so, we couldn't get away any earlier. It is so sad and empty here now, everybody left, the weather is awful. We are, actually, only passing by. In the summer it is a different story entirely. So many people come here. This year a man from America even died here. Just like that - he simply died. They say he was a local. Well, he came to meet his death. - Thank you for the water. - Don't mention it. There you are, you lecher! Why aren't you coming in? I am dressed. There is somebody in the other room. And what's wrong with that? I heard him cough. He looked at me. Everybody is curious here, this is the way it is. Why are you standing like this? What a lovely shirt. You say it's lovely? So what? I don't know, I just don't know... I have been thinking for so long that I just don't know... - Some people. - It is a hotel after all. We can't stand like this. Sit on your bed and don't look. I will wash up quickly. Stop! Stop! Who is it?! Oh, shit... Well, brother... You chose a lucky moment. Lieutenant Listek has arrived. - Who? - I have just told you. - Lieutenant Listek. - I don't know any such person. No problem. You will. So this is why you are so elegantly dressed, isn't it? Do you mind? Come on, let's go! Watch out, you fool. What are you doing? This is for the lieutenant. Get lost or I'll smack you. Only you're allowed? By God, stop quarrelling. Let's sing something for the lieutenant. Well... For what will we sing? If you can't sing, you don't have to. War, the wonderful lady, isn't kind to the soldiers. If she does not aim a bullet at his breast, war will make him disappear without a trace... Lieutenant, fresh German coffee. No, thank you very much, but I can't. Just a little, lieutenant, it's good for your health. Mężny, You could give these shoes to the lieutenant. What else will you say? They are wasted on your flat feet. Haven't you gotten mad at this lieutenant of yours? Well. Think before you speak. You will live to regret it. Shut up, you fools! The lieutenant went to sleep. Lieutenant Listek will give a speech on the current war situation. You must listen and behave properly. Up! Good afternoon, boys! Welcome, lieutenant! Sit down! The current war against Germany is not the first one in the history of the two nations. As you know well from the very beginning of our statehood We had to fight off attacks of our westerly neighbour, whose constant aim was to control Slavonic lands, the natural granary of Polish... You don't look well. Are you sick? Lieutenant... it is so because lieutenant is so beautiful that I... That I... Don't worry. Heads up. The victory is near. You must have left your family, didn't you? I am alone, lieutenant. My father was killed in a train accident, my mother was deported by Germans... Lieutenant, please allow me, just to look at you every now and then. It's not a good moment. One must forget about it. It's late, time to sleep... Goodnight. Goodnight, lieutenant. I will sit here a while longer. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. We must withdraw. Volunteers will go to face the Germans and stop them with gunfire. Do not panic. We have been through much worse. Any questions? Commander, please, send my detachment for the mission. OK, go. I report the 2nd detachment of the 4th squad, ready to leave on a military mission. Watch out, boys. We shall meet by the forester's lodge in Prużany forest. - Remember. - Yes, sir! Goodbye, lieutenant. Well, in a moment every Fritz will be here, we have been found. They were caught in a sweep operation. - They found them after all. - Who? Well, our boys and she. It's over. Boys! We must go back to help our boys. Follow me! Stop, who's coming? It's us. Mężny's squad. I was afraid something happened to you. You saw some fighting, didn't you? Not much, actually. Has everyone come back? Not everyone. Who was wounded, tell me! Lieutenant Listek. - Is she alive? - We carried her all the way. She was conscious still. Six kilometres away from the lodge she passed away. She jumped out first with a grenade. Nobody knows why. We tried to protect her, so help me God! But she just jumped and right away... ... over the souls of the faithful departed, who for their sins need consolation from us. Come. Why are you looking this way? Come... You see? We are. I didn't sleep a wink the last two nights. I was thinking that something would happen and we would not go. So was I. Life is always like this, it gives more fear than joy. I could have stayed in the city, I have experienced everything in my mind. How long has it been? Just a moment... We met in July... Almost a year. Do you want more space? No, no. Be quiet. These noises get on my nerves. Nobody knows us. Nobody knows anything. You see, we will meet someone by chance. So where can we find a safe place? I don't know. Aren't you cold? Not really. What were you thinking about when I was washing myself? Nothing, actually. You can't think about nothing. No, no, not today. It's a holiday tomorrow. Everyone will leave The hotel will be empty, we'll be alone. While you were waiting for me, I remembered something which is probably not worth remembering. But it's not against you. Not at all. It's as if it wasn't at all. Or maybe it wasn't after all? Good morning. Come in. Come in, we will not bite you. I have come to fetch our cow. Will you give it back? OK. I will. Just remember, when I find her in my field again, you will not get away so easy. - Goodbye. - Not so quickly. Please, wait, we shall talk. - We have nothing to talk about. - We will find something. We won't have anything to talk about with a nice young lady? Goodbye. You mustn't... You mustn't leave. Sit down there by the window. I have a lot of work to do, I don't have the time. I said that you mustn't. Partisans have a day off. When we leave in the afternoon, you will be free to go. Sit down there on the stool. It seems May has just passed, we were so happy, smiling and tender. Who can bring back those days... Maybe you will join the partisans? Give me your cool hand, look in my eyes and say if you love me. I know it is nothing but a dream. It is so joyful among us. Today here, tomorrow elsewhere. The choicest boys. Autumn roses, Sad autumn roses... You're tough. Maybe you belong to the commies? ... roses... - Kozak, can we listen to some records? - ... they are like your dear lips. Trees in autumn glory give us the ultimate protection... She is Piegza's daughter, secretary of that communist organization. A tough Bolshevik. She may be trouble. If you let her go, she may tell everyone. They will get to me. Smoke. One would have to... you know... - You know what. - What are you babbling about, I know best myself. Have it your way. They will arrest me, and my son as well... Cute girl. We would just have to... lead her away. Just a few kilometres. And... you know well. So that they didn't guess that... It's time to go. Did you see this girl there? Nice to look at. We are supposed to shoot her in the evening. Such a body. It's a waste. What do I care? ... they are wilting now. Come on, Satyr, let's drink to success. It is terribly hot but good vodka will cool you down. Well. Good vodka, burns your throat. I do it myself. I don't drink much but a small glass before going to bed, is good for your health. It burns, damn it. So? What do you think? - What about? - About it all. People are beginning to rebel. If they leave... Oh, no, my dear... There is no return. Where can one go from here? They will lock the door when you approach, set the dogs loose when you come unarmed... You want to sit down, talk about something, and you see that your host starts to shiver. He is casting nervous glances at the windows, the door handles and thinks "turn them in or not?" It will be like this till your dying day. As if you bathed in tar. You can't get it off in any way. Oh, it's nothing, nothing, do you understand? How long will it last? The whole earth is full of mines. We have gunpowder under our feet, you see? One word will be enough, and the whole nation will rise up. Why do you think I have a horse with me? A horse is necessary just in case. When the war is over, you, Satyr, will become a sheriff. You don't believe me? You will be a governor! A governor. I will go to Prussia, I will burn the whole shire, but I will not surrender. And I will kill all the commies. When the war is over, will you come to visit me? I will show you horses. My God, horses... And I will beat the English black and blue. Black and blue! They only think about politics, they wait... When we shed our blood here! We won't give up, commander. Enough. I won't drink. Jasieniek doesn't need anything else, white roses bloom for him. There in the valley where you fell, a big white rose blooms on your grave. There in the valley where you fell, a big white rose blooms on your grave. They are in the yard! Quiet, quiet, don't move. I will deal with it myself. God have mercy... Hands up! Move on, quickly! Take the horse! It's here. This house. Surround it! Quickly, don't lag behind! Open up! Open up, faster, or I will batter down the door! They won't open. Get inside through the window. Let's get in! We will take her alive. She has grenades! We will take her from the outside. Get me a ladder! I got it! Why are you standing? Hold the ladder. She shot me in the eyes, what a bitch! Any volunteers? I will go, commander. Move on! Hurray! We have to finish. Shoot at the roof, the straw will start to burn. We will smoke her out, bloody bitch! Move on! Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Don't you recognize me? No, I don't. Well, maybe... As if I saw you somewhere once... But no, I must be wrong. - We met... - Where? I will remind you when we have the time. How are things at home? Have you lived in this town for long? It must have been hard to leave the country. I will prepare some tea. Just don't make it too strong. I would like to finish with it before it gets dark. Here, you see, this sleeve starts to fall off. We can prepare dinner together. We will share the expenses. OK? OK. What is it? It is for you, I am not sure if you can accept it. Stockings. Will you... Would you marry me? I don't know. When you graduate. Wala... Do you remember the first time we talked? I said we had met before. Do you remember where it was? Last summer. Do you remember the fight and the fire a few days later? Do you have some time? It will all be as you wish but we must talk first. What shall we talk about? I will only tell you why it happened. You killed people. No, never. I have never killed anyone but... yes, I am partially responsible, although I hate death. - Communists also kill. - Enemies. I believed we were killing enemies. You mean Derkacz was right when he tried to shoot me? Me, when I was defending myself in the attic? No, no... It is the idea for which one kills that decides. And what idea is just in your opinion? I don't know, I don't know... I think the one which believes in life. Could you serve the evil? We want... We want happiness of all people. These are just slogans. There are prisons, police, secret service. People like Derkacz must be destroyed. People like... Like me? You are... You are very young. I shouldn't talk to you. We took different paths. Don't you like me? That's something different. I have to go now. I want to live, I want to work. I want to do something that people can profit from. And I want to be as far as possible from this politics, these empty talks, the fun that costs people their lives. Go to the police... Are you mad? Tell them about your past. No, it's out of the question. I will answer for my past only to myself. It is a much bigger responsibility. I will not confess anything to some fool. Can't you see I suffer enough? - You must do your penance. - For what?! I joined the partisans for the best of reasons. Look around, how many scoundrels there are in the world, and I would go on trial? Go, go. No, you can't expect it of me. Go, this is what must be done. What are you urging me to do? I will go there and they will lock me up because of some law, which does not account for the rich human life. I will stay in prison and waste days, months, years... I thought we could be together, that... That who knows. It is hard for me as well. But you have to go. You have to accept responsibility for everything you do. They could see. Will you go? Did you go? I did. Did you tell them everything? Everything. It's him. Why... I am not that terrible. Maybe I will be of some help one day. Are you healthy? Maybe hungry? I have to find a technical university. Maybe in Łódź? It would be nearer. Will you go alone? And what about Wala? Wala also must study. We will go together, We will buy school bags together. Hello. How are you? - It's you. - Yes, we started visiting the town. We've waited for you for a long time. How many did you rat on? Finish, why all this talking. Who can it be? Who is it? It's me, please, help me. Who are you? I am suffocating... Help me! Can you give an injection? I don't know, I could once. I felt so well. And suddenly... Is it any better? Get some rest now. My name is Goldapfel. Golden apple. This is all the gold that I have. I saw you arrive. Don't be afraid, please. I understand everything. I understand a lot now. You have to go now. There is somebody waiting for you. I will listen now. I will be listening until morning. Maybe you need something? Nothing more. I will be fine. Thank you. Thank you. Some asthmatic. Probably he came to this dump to die. What a lovely night. These guys drink, that guy is in agony... They are quiet now. Do you want to sleep? No, I can't. Someone is jealous of even this kind of a night. Who? Goldapfel. Golden apple. That's his name. What now? Nothing. What else can there be? It's over this way. I don't believe it myself. And I can't believe it when I look at you. It doesn't make sense to talk about it. You're right. We're not the only ones. Can you hear it? The train. The seventh tonight. Did you play? Why shouldn't I? You can still remember tangos from before the war. It got stuck in my head and I can't help it. When something gets stuck... - I came to give back the key. - Yes, yes. Are you going to church? Exactly, on the way. That Goldapfel, Golden Apple, probably woke you up. - I gave him an injection at night. - You see, what a life of a lonely man. He had a tenement house here before the war. When Germans came, they tore down the house, killed the family... He survived hidden by a farmer. But now he just can't come round. Why won't he leave? And who knows why he is still here? He moved in in '45 and hasn't left since. Every month he suffocates, almost dies, and then he gets up and goes to see the street that doesn't exist anymore. Did you sleep well? What? Stop raising dust, damned... Yes, we slept well. Young ones, no surprise... Young people don't need much. - Look. - I see. I can see everything. New shirt, new skirt, new shoes... Everything. Aren't you ashamed? But... - I meant the seams in my stockings. - Well. You know what? Get out. Can we sit down somewhere? Don't your feet hurt? No, it's cold, we must keep on walking. We still have almost 20 hours. It's better not to count. I guess we will have to go to town. Are you hungry? I'm not. What for? I will eat tomorrow, the day after tomorrow and the day after as well. Everybody knew her. Partisans sang songs about her. I had no idea that such a girl could exist. I thought she was conceived in our imagination. Katarzyna, Katarzyna, you are such a girl that you can have any boy you want. Katarzyna, Katarzyna, there is no way to make boys forget about you. When you want them to they drink, when you want them to they fight. What is it that you do, Katarzyna? When Katarzyna cries, when Katarzyna cries, all the boys, all the boys shed a tear with her. Katarzyna, Katarzyna, you are such a girl that you can have any boy you want. Katarzyna, Katarzyna, there is no way to make boys forget about you. When you want them to they drink, when you want them to they fight. What is it that you do, Katarzyna? Thank you, boys, for the service. - Excuse me. - Don't you recognize me? No. I don't think so. I fought in Szary's unit. Oh, yes, now I remember, you were a platoon sergeant. No. No. My pseudonym was Mężny. Oh, yes, now I remember well. Maybe we can have coffee together? With pleasure. I study at the technical university, I am alone here. Just like me. I study philosophy. I haven't got anyone here, apart from my uncle. He is a priest in Kielce region. And our friends? They live all over the country. Some managed to get to the West. People pass each other by without noticing. It is only today that I really saw you. In a week I am going to make a list of historical monuments in the Kielce region. To Janowo. To Janowo? This is my uncle's parish. Maybe we can meet there? Maybe, who knows? It seems to me... - It seems to me... - Finish off at last. What does seem to you this time? It seems to me that you should draw conclusions from what you've been thinking. And what conclusion that would be, sombre Bolshevik? I brought with me a declaration which you will sign here. You still hope to get me to the Party. Where are you dragging me? You are so well, you have the right to try to recruit me! Welcome, welcome, noble missionary. Did you catch any fish? You didn't? It's a pity. Our fish are politically non-aligned. God, protect them, they don't know what they are doing. Stop teasing me. Enough of these provocations. Maybe we can share a glass of cherry brandy? I know, I know, you mustn't, but we can do it very quietly. Very quietly. Shall we? Who is it? Take a look, missionary. Young eyes can see better. Who do I see? You have finally remembered your old uncle. I would like you to get to know each other. Gentlemen students. My dear niece. Look at the taller one, you will know what the biggest bigot in my parish looks like. You are going too far! - We have already met. - Well, well. We know each very well, don't we? Stop it... Now, let's drink to my health. To health! Leave me... I am not made of stone... Who is it? It's me. - Go to sleep, what are you doing? - Come to my room, see what is going on. Leave me alone. Trust me, it's not a deceit. What are you doing? Look. You didn't trust me? You have no idea how hard it is for me. I feel like a fish on a river bank. Am I worse than others? You talk nonsense. The Earth is for you, the sky is for you. I... I am for you, Katarzyna. It is my war-time pseudonym. My real name is different. Much more ugly... What now?! Your feelings are so small, so flat... God, how I want great love. I could lose my mind completely, I could do I don't know what. Maybe we have both thrown ourselves to a heaven that does not exist? What is it that you want now? We need you! We're going to the country, to purchase of agricultural products! - And will my diploma work? - It's just for three days! Well? Damn you! Our county will not be the best. It won't. We're missing 50 tonnes. Steal the grain from the peasants. World revolution awaits. Have you got any better ideas? Well? So don't blame me. - Thank you, bye. - Bye, missionary. Why are you telling me all this? I didn't say it against you. I know you didn't want to come here. I can feel it all the time. - Why are you silent? - Because it's not true. I made you come here. Nobody made anyone do anything. It is the way it had to be. But you regret it. I don't know. I don't know anything. Good morning. It's me, Goldapfel, Golden Apple. You must be looking for your lady. She went back to the hotel. She must have been cold, she ran so fast. It's a bad time, dear sir. And the day is so sad. Am I interrupting? - You aren't. - You know, a man needs a bit of warmth, if only from other people. Am I not interrupting? I always go to this forest. This is our cemetery. You might have seen it. Germans destroyed everything. Grass grew over everything. It's difficult to recognize. I am interrupting you. I will stay here. Goodbye. Where are you going, you scoundrel! Don't you understand what is going on here? Are you mad? Has my... Has my wife come back? Are you asking about your wife? Shut up, you lout! How can you play these stupid songs on a day like this... Was my wife here? I don't know, sir, we were out. Has anything happened? She felt unwell. And you left her alone? Well, I... She wanted to come back. Maybe Goldapfel saw her? He has big eyes. She might have gone home as we planned. I was supposed to do deal with something here. Otherwise everything is fine, thank you very much. Maybe you don't like it here? Why? It's a lovely town. We had a very nice trip. Very. Goldapfel, Golden Apple, wants to marry Mom. Shut up, damned boy! What are you babbling about? But it's true, Mom is lying. The Jew went mad apparently and he keeps talking about nothing else but marriage. Why would I marry him? I have enough to eat, a place to live. I don't want anything from anybody else. There is much more that can bind people together. It is all modern nonsense, sir, love or something. In my days there was no time to think about such things. A man was supposed to toil until his bones snapped. If a husband did not beat his wife, it was very good. I should be going. I am not talking to you about it all. I am sorry if you misunderstood me. I wish you all the best. Thank you. Are you staying for the night? Am I staying? I don't know... I will... Yes, I will. I will stay for the night and leave tomorrow. You know... What ideas you have. Just my luck - the bus is already gone, and the first train leaves after midnight. I searched for you all over the town. Weird. You were so afraid that someone might see you. I was, now I don't care. Are you hungry? - No, and you? - Me neither. - On an empty stomach. - What "on an empty stomach"? Nothing, it's funny. What shall we do? We will go to sleep. Turn, I need to wash myself. You know, it turns out that there is nothing on the Moon. Did you read it? Won't you come to me? Can you hear me? - No. - Why? I don't know. Come on, it doesn't make any sense. Michał. Don't. - No, I don't want to. - But why? - Go back there! - It doesn't make any sense. Let me go, no, no! Please, go, I beg of you, Michał. Leave me alone... Let me go! Who is it? It's me, Goldapfel, Golden Apple. May I ask you for a second? Is it necessary? Please. I need to talk to you, please. Maybe the lady would come as well? The lady is asleep. So early? My God, and I have some delicacies here. Foreign stuff. Thank you very much but you must understand. I know. I understand everything. But I wanted to express my gratitude. Please. Should I stay here or should I leave? - I don't quite understand. - I have relatives abroad. But why would I go? All my relatives are here, you saw it. I just need to live out my days. I can't really give you any advice. I know, you are thinking about something else entirely now. I followed you today. I was thinking "what a beautiful couple". How can you know what an old man needs. Everyone somehow deals with his life. Don't say so. These are unnecessary words. I wish you a lot of children, good business... - Mr Goldapfel... - Golden Apple. I know, I know everything. Please, stay a little longer. I... am very sorry... and very grateful that you dropped by. Please, take some cookies for the lady. Thank you. Goodbye. If you happen to visit our town again, I will be waiting. If I'm still alive. Please, remember my name. Goldapfel, Golden Apple. Goodbye, Mr Goldapfel. Goodbye. What did he want? Oh, he is bored. Why does he make so much fuss about his life? I have a tiring day tomorrow. I should be back in the city as soon as possible. Do you regret coming here? Tell me, do you regret it? I know it is so. It doesn't matter. I won't ever go anywhere again. Neither will I, I guess. Whatever we were supposed to experience has already happened. Do you blame me? And you? Why would I? Neither do I. Give me a cigarette. We have cookies from Goldapfel. Do you want some? Life goes on somehow. We can't expect too much. I think so too. The woman downstairs thinks it's a luxury. An invention of layabouts. If you add that we are an agricultural country - and we can't afford it... - No, I won't. So go to sleep. Shall we say goodbye? Tomorrow. What are you waiting for? For goodbye. Go to sleep. We have to up early in the morning. The feast is over. So it is a no? No. Goodnight then. Goodnight. Come back in the spring. Everything is in bloom then. Who comes in such a season? Thank you, it just happened so. I think I know you from somewhere. That's just my looks, many people say I remind them of someone. Haven't you been here before? Maybe you lived here? I didn't, certainly not. You left your newspaper behind. I wish you could join the orchestra with your concertina. He and his playing, only to avoid real work. Why are you laughing, damn fool! Goodbye. Goodbye, see you in the spring. Young people always visit us. It must be something in the air. And you? You know, I will take the next one. I understand. Maybe you're right. Wala, nothing has happened. Yes, you're right, nothing has happened. Each generation believes their lives are the hardest. I know, I know everything. You speak like Goldapfel, Golden Apple. Turn around. There is nothing to be ashamed of. Look who's saying that! We shall meet again. Certainly. Why wouldn't we meet again? It will be all right, Wala. You're right, it certainly will be all right. One still has things to do in one's life. You're right. There is so much work I have to do. You see? It will be all right. It certainly will. Move on! Young lady, it's time! Stop, please! Stop, please! Did... did you want to... say something? And you? Young lady, what happened? Nothing happened, I am staying here. - Go! - Thank you!
