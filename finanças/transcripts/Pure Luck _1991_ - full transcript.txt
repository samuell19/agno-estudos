Títeres. Títeres. - Consuegra, mire. - No, thank you. - Cuidado, señora. - Aaah! - ¿Todo está bien? - No, I'm just fine. I just got a heel stuck. - You okay? - Uh-huh, yeah. - It's okay? - Yeah. - It's all right. - It's all right. ¡Títeres! Where are my glasses? Oh, gracias. Por aquí. Thank you. Buenos días, señorita. Good morning. Which brings us to Vasily Pokrovsky. This world-famous pianist insures his hands with us for $8 million. Your daughter's on the phone from Mexico, Mr. Highsmith. - Is she all right? - She's fine. Her luggage was slightly damaged on the conveyor belt, but she's fine. Excuse me, gentlemen. - Hello, Valerie? - Daddy! - You're all right? - Daddy, everything's fine! Hold a minute, daddy. Could you put them on the bed, please? The people here have been wonderful to me. - What's wrong with your luggage? - My luggage? Nothing's wrong. Just got a little scuffed. You talked me into this, but I should never have let you go alone. Stop worrying. It's gorgeous here. I'm going to have a great vacation. Daddy, you won't believe this, but there's a man... aaah! Val... Valerie? - Oh, dear! - You all right? Ooo! We just got cut off, that's all. Valerie, what's wrong? Really, I'm fine. I'm going to go for a walk. I want to take some pictures. - Stop worrying. - I worry! I love you. I love you too. Bye. Increíble que se haya salvado. Palabra que dios es grande. - ¿Qué pasa? - La gringa. ¡Vámonos! Yo le agarro la cámara. Little boy, take your picture? Stop! - Aaah! - ¡agarra la cámara! ¡Andale, ándale! ¡apúrale... vamos! - Vamos, ahí viene un auto. - ¡ahí voy! - ¡Jorge, vamos! - Ya vengo. Hey, are you all right? Where am I? You're in Mexico. Am I mexican? No, cupcake. You're not. What is your name? My name's... ah, it's... what is my name? Well, don't you worry about it, cupcake. Why don't we just get you out of the street. Find you some cool place where you can think. I have to get her out of Puerto Vallarta. There's nothing wrong with her. She just banged her head. Soon as she remembers who she is, the sky... oh, god. - We'll be on the 5:00 flight to Acapulco. - Oh! Oh, my. I'm so sorry. That was over 500 years old. You broke the only one that wasn't a fake. I'm really sorry. Could I replace it for you or we could just glue it? Oh, princess. Don't you worry about it. Your family can reimburse me... Just as soon as you remember who you are... Your phone number, where you live. Your name. - I'm trying. - I know you are. Here's a nice cup of tea for you. To the door. - ¿Sabes quién es esa mujer? - No, pues parece americana. Hurry up. Get her in here! Get the hell in here! Have a nice day, sir. Mr. Highsmith. - Good morning, Mr. Highsmith. - David. - Mr. Highsmith, sir, excuse me. - Yes? - I have to talk to you. - What about? It's about your daughter. I have a theory. Theory? What kind of theory? What I'm about to propose may sound a little unorthodox. Unorthodox. She's been missing for over a month. No ransom note. The police don't have a clue! I sent Raymond Campanella down with a team of private detectives. They couldn't find anything either! I've talked to psychics, astrologers, fortune tellers! So don't tell me about unorthodox. Mr. Highsmith, there's a man who works in your accounting department. His name is Eugene Proctor. What about it? Ask him to join us in the conference room. There's something I want you to see. What are you doing? I propose we conduct an experiment to demonstrate my theory. What has this to do with my daughter? I've been working here for five years. The only time I've heard you mention your daughter... Is to relate to some catastrophe that's befallen her. From all you've told me, she must be the unluckiest woman in the world. Bad luck is fascinating, Mr. Highsmith. Mr. Proctor is here, sir. Ask him to come in! When he comes in, ask him to sit down. Where? - At the table. - Oh, yes. - You want to see me, sir? - Yes... please sit down. - Where? - Anywhere you want. Excuse me. I'm sorry, sir. Thank you, Mr. Proctor. You can go now. Where? - Back to your office. - Oh, yes. That'll be all, Mr. Proctor. Good-bye for now. How did you know that he would sit on that chair? Mr. Highsmith, if that had been your daughter, what would she have done? Mr. Campanella, Mr. Highsmith will see you now. Oh, Raymond. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I want you to meet Dr. Julius Monosoff, he's our company's psychological consultant. This is Raymond Campanella who led the team of investigators in Mexico. Dr. Monosoff has a theory about my daughter. I want to run it past you. Please sit down. Remember what I told you about my daughter's bad luck? Yes. That's the basis of this theory of Dr. Monosoff's. I know you're going to think it's kinda crazy, but... you tell him, Dr. Monosoff. Mr. Highsmith's daughter is a textbook example... Of coincident-misfortune syndrome. The only way to find Valerie... Is to hire someone as unlucky as she, who will intuitively lead you to her. Is this some kind of joke or something? A guy like you can't find her because... you're normal. Only someone as unlucky is going to slip on that same banana peel, or tumble off that same hotel balcony, or if he's really unlucky, fall through the same hole in the universe that swallowed Valerie... And lead us to her. Mr. Highsmith, can I talk to you in private? Yes, of course. - Excuse us, Dr. Monosoff. - I have more to say. Graphs, charts. It sounds unorthodox. Just keep an open mind. The man is selling you false hope like those psychics. Can't you see? I want you to go back to Mexico with Eugene Proctor and reopen the investigation. - With who? - Eugene Proctor. He's the kind of man Dr. Monosoff was talking about. I know it's a long shot, but it's all I've got left! - I can't believe I'm here. - This isn't some flippant theory. You know Delacroix, the painter? Wonderful example of incredible bad luck. At the age of three, he's almost strangled by the cord of some draperies. The mosquito net over his bed catches fire, very badly burned. While recovering, he almost drowns in the bathtub. Saved by a miracle. Then he chokes on some grapes. It's all true. What about Milton, the english poet? Just before he goes blind, his dog drags his manuscripts into a fire. I mean... here's our man. He looks pretty normal to me. Yes, but I've been keeping my eye on him... Since he came for a job interview. He was late. Got stuck in a elevator with a pregnant woman who went into labor! - That can happen. - This man's been hit by lightning twice, once while inside a movie theater. As a premature baby, guess what happened to his incubator? It broke down. There was a mix-up. He was given to the wrong parents. It goes on for 35 years. Look. It's all here. I'm not kidding. I'm writing a paper on this man. When you finish, send me a copy. I'll read it. I've been studying the accident-prone. Their behavior is remarkably consistent. If you send somebody after her who's as unlucky as she is, he could literally stumble onto her. You actually believe this. I actually do. Well, I don't. - Sorry! - Hey, you! - Aaah! - You see that guy? Raymond, thank you. - I'm deeply grateful to you. - It's all right, sir. There's something I almost forgot. Dr. Monosoff wants Mr. Proctor... To think he's in charge of the investigation. So you'll be his assistant. - I'll be his what? - Assistant... But only in his head. You'll be running the show. Gentlemen. I knew you'd reconsider. Just how did you know that? You've found every missing person you've looked for until... Valerie Highsmith. Unconsciously, you're driven by a fear of failure. - Mr. Proctor is here. - Oh! Yes. - Are you all right, Mr. Proctor? - Yes, sir. You know Dr. Monosoff and this is Mr. Campanella. Please sit down, Mr. Proctor. - Where? - Here. I suppose you're wondering why I asked you here. - I would like to apologize for breaking the chair yesterday. - Never mind. You are aware of what happened to my daughter? Sir, absolutely terrible. If there's anything I can do... there is. You can help me. - Me? - Yes. Dr. Monosoff tells me... That not only are you extraordinarily logical... But that you also possess a highly-developed sense... Of intuition... And a bold, creative flair for problem solving. I really don't know what to say. Thank you. I want you to go to Mexico and look for my daughter. Mexico? I don't speak spanish. Mr. Campanella does. He's an investigator. He'll go with you. He'll be your assistant. Isn't that right, Mr. Campanella? Ah... yes. Needless to say, I'll pay all your expenses... And put you on double salary. There's a $50,000 reward if you can find her. What do you say, Eugene? I accept. Good! Good! Thank you. Listen, I... we can be working on this thing for the next few weeks. I can't very well keep calling you Mr. Campanella. What do your friends call you? Raymond. Was I amazed when Mr. Highsmith asked me to head this investigation! Were you? Well, actually, not really. I was never cut out to be an accountant. I have other sides to me. I really have a very good feeling about this. I think we're going to make a good team. Ouch! Oh! I'm sorry. No problem. - It's fine. - Sorry, sir. I know that your investigation has not gone... Terribly well so far. I think now with the two of us, your luck's gonna change. Here. - What are you doing? - Excuse me? I'm sorry, but this is my cart. Oh yeah? I don't see your name on it. - What's the problem? - This guy tried to steal my cart. Listen, you little weasel, the cart was just sitting there. Forget it, okay? He called me a little weasel. I am trained in martial arts; judo, aikido, karate. The first thing they teach is complete control. If someone calls you a jerk, you don't hit him. You just look at him and you walk away. Jerk. Complete control. Moron! - Does it hurt? - It's just cold, but it feels good. Lie still please. You're very kind. I checked the luggage. If we don't get moving, - the bags are gonna take off without us. - Okay. I feel a little dizzy. We're gonna miss the plane if you don't hurry up. Stop! What now? My wallet. I left it in the infirmary. - My ticket's in it. - Just take your time. We'll never make... Proctor? - What? - That flight's delayed. See? There's nothing to get so worked up about. I've never been on a plane that left on time in my life. They're always delayed. Usually for days! Mr. Eugene Proctor, come to the baggage claim. Wait. They usually announce it twice. - Mr. Eugene Proctor, come to the baggage claim. - Told ya. It's this way. Follow me. Is this yours, Mr. Proctor? Look, we're very sorry, sir. But the aircraft's loading hatch malfunctioned... And closed on your suitcase, which is why the flight was delayed. You'll have to itemize the contents of your bag... So we can compensate you for any damage, Mr. Proctor. - Do we have to now? We're gonna miss our flight. - Usually my bags get lost. The flight to Puerto Vallarta leaves in an hour and a half. We've got time to eat. I'm starving! Sorry I'm late. I stopped to get some postcards. I didn't have pesos, so I gave them what I had. Ahem! Proctor? Proctor! Hello. You'll excuse me. That was a little awkward, wasn't it? - Guess we should order. - I've ordered. Oh, good. I bought some postcards. That door that didn't open at the airport. - Were you surprised? - No, not really. Ahh. That's pretty. I gotta send this to miss Morgan in personnel. She is so sweet, this woman. - She helped me when I was electrocuted. - How did that happen? At the office, trying to plug in the coffee machine. Good choice! This is one of the few proteins I can eat. Generally, I'm a pretty strict vegetarian. Oh, pen leaked. I'm gonna wash my hands. Be right back. I'm hungry. Why are you looking at me like that? - Ah, no reason. - Por favor, señor, - may I have one of your salt shakers, please? - Oh, sure. So, what's your plan? - My plan? - About Highsmith's daughter. We'll be in Puerto Vallarta this afternoon. What are you gonna do? I thought I'd follow a more classical... method. What exactly is a "classical method"? Well, it's... I have to explain it to you. It's getting to know people in the underworld, gaining their trust, learning their secrets. I thought maybe if we checked into the same hotel as Valerie Highsmith, possibly even the same room... she fell off the balcony five minutes after she checked in. You want to do that too? - She did? - After that, she bought film at the pharmacy. The sales girl remembered because Valerie's credit card... Got mangled in one of those credit card machines. That's why I don't use credit cards. Then she took a taxi to the beach. - The driver was the last person to see her alive. - I want to question that driver. I already have... three times. Good. Although what if he's not telling the truth? What if... go with me on this. What if he and the girl from the pharmacy are working together? - It might be conspiracy. - I checked 'em out. - It isn't. - Ah. I still would like to question them. People might feel freer telling me things than they would you. Ohhh! Jesus Christ! You can't even have breakfast without hurting yourself. What are you mad for? I'm the one who's bleeding. Why don't you go to the infirmary? They haven't met you at this one yet. Boy! Okay, let's go. - What took you so long? - They want your whole medical history. - I'm surprised. - You're back so soon. What's that mean? Just don't walk into any more glass doors. I couldn't help that those doors didn't open. The nurse said the same thing happened... To a another person a few weeks ago at this airport. - Man or woman? - I don't know. Somebody just walked right into them, so I'm not the only one. - Wait here! - Where you going? Wait here! Yes, it might be her. Muchas gracias, señorita. The girl I saw had brown hair, but there is a resemblance. - What about the guy with her? - Talk to inspector Segura. I gave him a full report. Thank you. Gracias. You don't understand. This is not what I wanted. I want the last row, right hand side, aisle seat. This is row 13. It cannot be the last row. Eso es lo que ud. Tiene, señor. Oh, good. How do say "last row" in spanish? - We're not leaving. - What are you talking about? The girl who hit her nose on the door was an American. She might have been Valerie Highsmith. Really? I knew it. I knew it the second I saw her. - Knew what? - That I was going to pick up on her trail. It's exciting, isn't it? We finally get a break. After a whole month of disappointment and failure, we got a lead, my friend! We should stop and phone Mr. Highsmith. We could tell him we're finally making some progress. We're checking into a hotel. I've got an appointment at police headquarters at 6:00. When you think about it, it was actually lucky... That door didn't open at the airport. It's true... because if I hadn't smashed my nose, we wouldn't have missed the flight and gone straight to Puerta vallarta... And you'd be right there where you were before... Wrong town with no clues at all. Let's get this straight. You bumped into the door. I was the one who put it together... That the person who bumped into the door might be Valerie Highsmith. I don't want to hear about luck. - I'm just saying it's lucky... - it's a coincidence! We don't know if that girl was Highsmith's daughter! We have nothing to tell Mr. Highsmith. With all due respect, just shut up and let me get on with this case. - Stop the car. - What? Stop the car. - What's the problem? - Your attitude. You've an attitude problem and I don't know what to do. Me? What do you mean, attitude problem? How about telling me to shut up? You don't think that's rude? You say, "I got an appointment at police headquarters at 6:00"... As if you're the boss! You know darn well that Mr. Highsmith was very clear on this point. I am in charge of the investigation... And you are my assistant. No matter how nice I am to you, you keep acting like you're running the show. Now, what is the problem? I was out of line. It won't happen again. Well, okay then. You don't know me well, but... When you get to know me better, you'll realize... I'm the kind who bruises easily but heals fast. So let's pretend this never happened. I wish I could. Come on. I am miss Flores. How can I help you? We need two rooms, please. All we have left is a suite and a single room... Unless you're sharing a room. No, no. This is my assistant. I'll take the suite. He can take the single. Ramon will see you to your room. Be in the bar in an hour for a brief meeting. - How long are you planning to stay? - Two or three days at the most. What's your name? - Angela. - Angela. Angela, I'm not his assistant. I didn't think so. Aaah! Whoops, excuse me! - Señor. - Lo siento. ¿Se encuentra ud. Bien? - ¿Sí, señor? - Scotch, please. Make that a double. Do you have any water in your room? Yeah. Why? Hmm! I don't. I couldn't even take a shower. Boy, it's hot. So let's... Get down to business. Why don't we determine our schedule. - When do we meet the police inspector? - At 6:00. What time do you have? - Uh... it's twenty to. - I have ten to. Let's synchronize our watches at quarter to. Let's split the difference. Or I'll set it for twenty to. Could I have the same as he's having, por favor? Naturally I have my... Own gut feelings on this case. That's what I'm paid for, but I'm definitely open to any input... That you might have. Any input. There's a slim chance the girl at the airport was Highsmith's daughter. - Yes. - My gut tells me... That we should stay here a few days to make sure. It's possible that she wasn't kidnapped. She may have become involved with some guy... And she's afraid to tell her father about it. Am I boring you? No-no-no-no. Yes... The sex issue is important to me too. Another explanation for why there's never been a ransom demand... Is that... She could have... Fallen in the hands of a cult... And been brainwashed. Am I talking to myself? I'm sorry. There's a girl at the bar. I think she's attracted to me 'cause she keeps looking at me. - $50. - What do you mean? She's a $50 hooker. Any guy can have her for $50. No, the sweet little girl in the red dress... With... the belt. Walk over to her and say... $50. She'll be in bed in less than two minutes up in your suite. You think she's a prostitute? Go ask her? If I'm wrong, I'll give you $50. Go ahead. Sorry. She's a hooker. I don't get it. I did exactly what you told me to do. I was wrong. I'm sorry. ¿Qué pasa? I made a mistake and you made $50. Okay? - You did it on purpose! - Why would I do that? Because you're jealous, that's why! Because I'm in charge and I'm getting the job done... And woman are attracted to me and you can't stand it! Jealous? She's a whore! Anybody else offers her $50, she goes for it! - Why not me? - You tell me. Why don't doors open? Why does your luggage get smashed? You tell me! You call my girlfriend a whore? No, it was him. No one called anyone a whore. Let us buy you a drink. - You called her a $30 whore. - Fifty! - Are you all right? - Yes, yes. You have a headache? No, no. I'm fine. Let's just proceed with the scheduled briefing. The girl was with a man called Frank Grimes, an American who's been living in Mexico. It would surprise me he made a kidnapping like this by himself. He's a small-time criminal. And according to the guard, they were met by three men at the airport. Please, do have a cigar. They're from Havana. - The very best. - Take over, would you? If you'll... Excuse me, I just need to... Consider this new information I've been given on the case. - Your boss is taking this very hard. - He's not... he knocked himself out walking into a glass door. And this afternoon, he broke a mirror with his head. Really? Aaah! - Think he hurt himself? - Of course. This Grimes character, - is there anyone in town who would know about him? - Well, he lived with a mexican girl called Sonia... Who used to work at El Sombrero Club. Buenas tardes, amigos. - Shall we talk to the bartender? - No, no, you go ahead. I'll just check the place out. Buenas noches, señor. What's your pleasure? I'm looking for a girl named Sonia who worked here. There are a lot of Sonia's, señor. I thought maybe this Sonia... Might have left a forwarding address. I would love to help you, señor. But there are many women who come and go at the El Sombrero. That is its charm! You know I'm not really good at... Give me your expense money. What for? You broke? It's a setup. She's going to clean you out. I know what I'm doing. Now just sit down. I can handle it. You're making her nervous. - How can you be such an idiot? - She knows something... And I'm going to get it out of her, so butt out. Hey, listen to me, Proctor. This is not an infirmary and these girls are definitely not nurses! Uno momento. I'm gonna tell you something. Your friends may not tell you, but I think you ought a know. You intimidate people. It's true. I think I can establish a rapport with this girl. Oh! A rapport! A rapport! And I don't want you to blow it. This is our only potential lead. So, please. There's time for intimidation... And there's time for more subtle methods. Just go back to the hotel. Please. That's an order! Yes! I order another bottle of champagne. Oh, no! No! Don't. First we're going to hear about Sonia. Sonia "leaved" here two years ago. She moved to California. Now you come home with me. That's it? She moved to California two years ago? Look, I better go. Campanella was right. - Angela, did Mr. Proctor get back yet? - Not yet. If he comes back, tell him I went looking for him. - Okay. - It's Raymond. Bye. Ah. Ow! Ow! Ooo! It looks like you established... Quite a rapport, Proctor. Ahhh! Was it the girl at the bar? How many? One? - Is that the only finger that works? - Uh-huh. - They took all the money. - Okay. Could you get my boss a doctor? I'll be right back. Raymond? I'm gonna go with you. - Where do I find her? - Who? - The girl! - She lives with Fernando. He runs a gambling joint... In the old town. Get lost. - We'd like to come in. - It's a private club. You no understand eng... how do I join? Open the door. Hmm? - Proctor! - Oh! Fernando, I think you owe this gentleman some money. I could take it all. Give me the $2,000. Actually it was $1,650. I want $2,000. Dale El Dinero. Take it easy now. So... okay then. We should be lookin' for Grimes. Instead I have to spend the night cleaning up your mess. - Ah! - Here. Ouch. I'm sorry. I was wrong. This entire thing was my fault. I had no right to talk to you like that. - I was completely out of line. You have every right... - forget it! Thank you. - What'd you do that for? - I threw my Kleenex out. That was my handkerchief. Oh, god. Really? I'm sorry. I guess I'm a little shaky still. I'm getting my second wind and we are definitely gonna find Grimes. You'll see. We will. What's he supposed to look like? When you're lookin' for someone, you have to make sure... You know what they look like. You don't find people by... Running into doors and being rolled by cheap hoodlums. It's no big deal. You just don't have a memory for faces. So what? I'll tell you something. I have problems recognizing people too. Oh, sure. Him? I'm walking down the street and see a face reflected in a store window? It takes a second before I realize it's me. The point is, you mustn't let it bother you. You can be a great private eye and have bad eyesight. Anyway, you have a lot of other qualities. My goodness. Look how big you are. I wish I were half your size. You are half my size. That's another thing. You're observant. You think that would easily compensate for the whole... - Poor eyesight problem. - Proctor? - Yes. - Give it a rest. Oh. No! - Open the door. - No more. What's all this? - Let's go, Frank. - Why me? You just got unlucky. Come on, guys. - Okay, pull over. - What is this? Get out here! - Remember her? - Huh? Listen to me. I'm not a cop. I just want to know if this is the girl you brought from Puerto Vallarta. Count to three. If he doesn't talk by then, I'm pullin' the trigger. - You mean, like, one... two... - count! One, two, two and a bit... okay, okay. Ah, I knew she was trouble. I knew it. I was never going to hurt her. You don't need to. She does it to herself. - That's her. - How do you know? - I know. - No, you don't know. It was a nightmare from the minute I saw her. It's okay. I know what your talkin' about. I understand. - Understand what? - Nothing. I thought I could get money from her family. Ha-ha. She's got amnesia. She doesn't know who she is. You know what I spent on medical bills alone? She cleaned me out. I couldn't afford to keep her hostage. - Where is she? - I turned her over to Fernando. I was a nervous wreck. - You don't know what she's like. - Let's go. Back to the gambling club. We're gonna have a talk with Fernando. - That's the third time. - No doubt about it, you are an accountant. Don't make me go back. If they find out I talked, they'll kill me. - Let's go. - Oh. ¡Ay, ay, ay! - We're stuck in sand. - I can't believe it. It's humanly impossible to get everything wrong! What's your problem? You told me stop, so I stopped. Of course you pulled over! You stopped... right into this! If there's any shit around, you're gonna step into it. I don't know why I'm surprised. Did you not hear him tell me to pull over? - You heard him, right? - Right, that's what I told him. But look around. You see any sand? That way? That way? No! But he found some. He always does. He has X-ray vision. I wouldn't bring up eyesight if I were you. Wha... what? I may have parked here, but I don't need a magnifying glass... To recognize someone who looks exactly like his picture. Forgive me if I'm a little distracted from dealing with your mess. What a joke! This is getting boring. - Give it a rest. - Maybe you need glasses. Did you ever think of that? Maybe he's afraid he won't look good in glasses. - Maybe he doesn't feel he... - watch out! - Proctor, are you all right? - What happened? I knew it. That girl... Nothing but trouble. You'll see. It'll be your turn next. Ahhh. What does he mean, "it'll be your turn"? Probably delirious. Think he's dead? What's that smell? A bullet hole in the gas tank... the tire. Let's get out of here. Are you sure this is a shortcut? If you don't want to talk, just say so. You're not going to say another word for the entire journey, right? Is this the maturity level we're working at? I never thought I'd say this, but you'd even make my ex-wife look quiet. She never stopped running her mouth morning, noon, and night. We're gonna have this out once and for all. We're not taking another step... Until you and I get a few things settled. Let me remind you that if it hadn't been for me... We would never have found Grimes. If I hadn't been in that nightclub, the girl would not have set me up, - we would never have gone to the gambl... - I don't believe this. You're trying to take credit for some stupid coincidence that almost got us killed. - I don't believe in that shit. I believe in logic and reason. - You should be... that's how we gonna find her. That... that... what are you doin' now? - I'm sinking. - Why are you sinking? I don't know. - How come I'm not sinking. - 'Cause you're standing on... - Normal sand and I'm standing on quicksand. - There's no quicksand in Mexico! Congratulate me, 'cause I just discovered some. - Try to get out. - It's a well-known fact... That if you struggle you sink faster. Grab this! Hold on! Ahhh, thank you. Thank you. I lost my shoe. Look at that. You never rest, do you, Proctor? Thanks, buddy. - Who's that? - Proctor, wait! Hey! Over here! ¡Policía! - How long are they gonna keep us in here? - I don't know. I told them to call inspector Segura. So all we can do is wait. I have been here for two years. Open up! You're making a terrible mistake! I gotta speak to someone in charge. Relax. Save your breath. They'll release us eventually. Gee, I don't like their attitude. Yelling only makes the guards angry. Ohh. Madre de dios. Now they will pick one of us and beat him like a dog. Why are you lookin' at me like that? You! - Me? - You come with us. - Señor! - Huh? - Oh, gees. - Ay, ay, ay. I'm fine. I'm fine. Jesus. Don't touch me. Stay away from me. It's not your lucky day, is it? Luck! Don't talk to me about luck. There's no such thing. It doesn't exist. Luck is for leprechauns, four-leaf clovers, horseshoes, rabbit feet. - It's rabbit's foot. - Whatever! All of it! I don't believe it. You understand? You understand! Ohhh, you like to scream, huh? Please, come with us. Do you have any threes? Go fish. Fished what I wanted... And I am out! I usually never win at cards. I don't understand. - This is fun. Raymond! Oh, I'm so sorry. Let me help you. - It is all a terrible mistake. - It can happen to anybody. - I'll phone you. - Okay. Excuse me? Thanks. You were right. We picked up Fernando. He talked. But it is bad news, I'm afraid. After you left with Grimes, he panic and put the girl on a private plane to Mexico City. But it never arrived. It must have crashed in the jungle. I'm sorry. We were so close. I'll call Highsmith in the morning. Hi. - What? - You have water in your room? They fixed it a couple of days ago. So, how did Highsmith take the news? He thinks Valerie might still be alive. - Really? - He's convinced that she... Survived the plane crash. - I feel sorry for the man. - When you think about it, they haven't found her body yet. We're talkin' about a girl who fell off a 6th floor balcony, and didn't even get hurt. You probably think Highsmith's new idea makes perfect sense. - What idea? - He wants us to go in a plane, fly over the jungle where Valerie's plane crashed. Then what's supposed to happen? Maybe we get lucky and crash ourselves... In the same place, and find her. That's... well... - hi. - Hi. That's our plane right there. Watch your head. What kind of parachutes do you use? Parachutes? Aah! Not necessary, my friend. I take you up. I bring you down. Don't worry. Is there a chance of getting one... Just in case? I don't think your friend trusts me too much. It's not you. It's just practical. The plane we're looking for crashed and if they had a parachute... if he keeps talking like this, he's gonna bring bad luck. Mala suerte, mi amigo. You're looking a little queasy. If you're not feeling well, I can go up by myself. You really mean that? Absolutely! No problem. I'll fly in a few circles, check out those mountains. You wait at the hotel. Maybe you're right. It's stupid for all of us... To cram ourselves into a little plane. Go get some rest and I'll meet you back for margaritas. That's an order, bub! Good-bye, Eugene. Yeah, well, I'll meet you back at the hotel. I, uh... I'm sorry. I mean, I didn't really mean all those things I said about you. Oh, that! Okay. Uh... I... I guess this is good-bye. What's the matter with you? There's a bee. Don't move. - What? - I'm allergic to bee stings. If it stings me, I'll die. - What? - I'm not kidding. On my last vacation, a bee stung me as I was getting off the plane in Maui. I nearly died. When it stings me, I start swelling up and then I can't breathe. - Let me get rid of it. - No-o-o-o-o. Don't move. I can flick it away. I have very fast hands. No, no, no! Fast movement might make it nervous. Hey, what are we waiting for? Just bear with me. Oh, you got a bee on your cheek. Oh! Oh! Only you... it could only happen to you! There was probably honey on my face. - Are you okay? - I'm fine, just frightened. - I'm comin' with you. - You don't have to come. - Watch your heads. - I said I'm fine. I really... ah. Thank you. These little planes get off the ground a lot faster... Than 747s, right, Raymond? Ouch! Ahh! - Now what? - I don't know. There's a nail in this seat or something. - Everything okay? - All systems go. You sure? Look, we got fuel, we got oil pressure, and we flyin'. Right? There's gotta be something wrong. What amazing vegetation! So lush! - Proctor. - Hmm? - Are you all right? - Fine. And you? Land the plane as soon as possible. Mexico is such a land of contrasts! Oh, no! He's choking. Land! Land! ¡Bájese! I'm sorry. I haven't been a very good traveling companion. "No hey agua en mi quato." Agua en mi cuarto. En cuar-r-r-to. Tengo dolor de "cabizza." - Cabeza. - Cabeza. Cabeza. Mi "coro" está trabado. There's no water in my room. I have a headache. My car is broken down. I could have used all of these. This is a very good book. No, thank you. - ¿Cigarro? - No, thanks. - Uno. - No, thank you. - One cigarro. - Uh-uh. I don't. - Uno nomás. - Sure. That would be good. Very good. That's fun. You haven't read any of the recent literature on smoking? You all right? Raymond! I'm fine. I'm back to normal. Come here. I wanna show you this. You wouldn't believe what happened to this poor guy. His whole village was burned to the ground... incinerated. He has these awful nightmares in spanish. The nurses say he keeps talking about this girl who wandered into his village. He fed her, gave her a place to sleep. The next morning she offered to cook breakfast... And the village burned to the ground. You know that picture of Valerie? Let's see what happens when you show it to him. Yeah. Yeah. Aaah! Aaah! Aaah! The poor guy's suffered enough. This isn't a game. Do you know this woman? ¿conoces a esta mujer? He's in a state of shock. He won't speak. So... so, what do you think? What do you think? You picked up the trail again. - Maybe we should try to find that village. - Right. I know how you feel about logic. - And this isn't logical, but do you realize... - That if I hadn't been stung I wouldn't have ended up in this hospital. You don't have to convince me. Noisy, isn't he? I barely slept a wink. Anybody home? Hello! Just as I thought. Now what? Well, whatever you want to do. Ahh. If I was Valerie Highsmith... And I had burned down this village... - I'm sure she didn't do it on purpose. - No, she's not like that. I don't think she'd intentionally hurt someone. But I think sometimes... bad things just happen over and over to certain people. It's not anybody's fault. It's just... I'm starting to see it now... Eugene. Don't move. - Ahh! - Try and relax. Just relax. I... aah! Don't shoot! Maybe it'll go away. If it bites, you'll be dead in under 12 seconds. - How do you know? - Stay still. No, don't! Oh! I'm sorry. Are you okay? No, goddamn it. Give me that gun! I didn't mean to do that. I really didn't. - Is there anything I can do? - No, forget it. - Sit over here. - Eee-ow! Oh! I'm just such a bungling idiot! What am I picking up a gun for? I don't know about guns. Now I've shattered your leg. No, no, no. You just grazed me. Something good is gonna come of this, I know it. I don't believe it, but I know it. Ow! God, my life was dull before I met you. - We gotta get you to a doctor. - No, no, no. It's just a scratch. I don't need anything. It could get infected. There's a mission 12 miles from here. - A mission? - How do you know? It's on the map. Just take it easy. Lean on me. - Looks like another dead end. - Uh-huh. - Better turn around. - Yeah. What's the matter? Oh! Don't move. Don't even breathe. Lucky we didn't keep backing up. - Shh. - Okay. I thought you knew what you were doing. I actually believed it. - What an idiot I am! - You're hurting my nose. If we don't do something fast, you won't have a nose. Do exactly what I tell you. When I say "now," get over the windshield onto the hood... As quickly as possible. Understand? - Proctor, understand? - I nodded yes. Now! - What're you doin'? - Getting my things together. - I'm ready to get out of the car now. - Getting your things together? Why do you have your keys? I suppose you do nothing out of habit! I don't think leaping frantically is so safe. Stop talking and come over the windshield. All right. Okay. Aaah! - Raymond, are you all right? - Sure, Eugene. Never felt better. - What should I do? - Get to the front. Stay there. Don't worry. I'm not gonna die this way. I'm goin' to the front. I'm gonna stay there. - Are you there? - Yes, yes. - Just stay there. - I am so sorry, Raymond. I feel awful about this. Raymond! Oh, god. Raymond! Oh, my god. Raymond! Good-bye, dear friend. You will be missed. Aaah! Oh, my god. I thought you... I couldn't see where you were. - I assumed you'd fallen. - I'm here. - Let's go. Let's move. - No, no. We should stay with the jeep. That's the best plan... - Because they say never leave your vehicle. - We're not staying. - We're moving. It's an order. - An order? Yeah. I'm giving you an order. It's an order. I'm in charge. You never were. Let's move. What are you talking about? Didn't you ever wonder why they chose you, an accountant who doesn't speak spanish? Mi carro... mis manos... Agua... mañana. They chose you because you're like Highsmith's daughter. You're a walking disaster area just like she is. They thought you might lead me right to her. I didn't want to tell you, but... We're lost because of that idiot Monosoff and his theories about bad luck. You're a pathological liar. Oh, Jesus Christ, grow up, will you? They told you you had highly-developed intuition... And a bold flair for creative problem solving. They were leading you on. I don't want to hurt your feelings... But I'm taking charge because I don't wanna be found... Ten miles down the road, dead of exhaustion or eaten by some animal. I'm gonna break your neck. Don't blame me. It was the stupidest idea I'd ever heard. Break your neck! No. Hey... no, no. Cut it out. You're gonna hurt yourself. Aaah! - Ohh! Ooo! - Did you hurt yourself? Let me see your hand. Watch out! There's a... tree. - Ohhh! - You all right? - Yee-ah! - Wait! Wait! Yee-ah! - Ohhh! - Let me help you. Get your hands off me. Aaah! Hey. Here. Hey, amigo. You gonna make it, Proctor. Yeah! Everything's gonna be okay. You'll see. You'll see. Last couple of days, he's banged his head... I don't know... a half dozen times. It's definitely a concussion, maybe a fracture. - We'll take good care of him. - Is there a surgeon here? He really banged it hard. You might have to operate soon. Don't worry. Is he a close friend? Yeah. Yes, he is. Who are you? I don't know. Where am I? I don't know. Ohh. This must be some kind of a hospital. I've never seen such a beautiful hospital... And I've been in hospitals all over the world. Me, too. Hey, Eugene! Valerie. Oh, no, no. They're fine. Hey, you found her! It's Valerie Highsmith. Valerie? Valerie. Yeah. Raymond! It's Valerie Highsmith. - Yeah! - We found her! Yeah!
