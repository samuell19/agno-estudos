While wandering through life, a dead end may show up unexpectedly. In a strange place, with no warning. Yoomi, have you had lunch yet? Not yet. The weather looks great. Shall we eat outside? Sure! The world around me slowly filled with colour once more. Despite the lingering pain... I feel the change unfold within me. Hey, Nishiyama, what is happiness to you? The feeling of freedom, I guess... How about you? Hm... Memories of a Dead End Did you manage to contact him? Has he replied? Yeah. I've texted him. He'll reply when he sees it. Sorry Yoomi, my break is over. Call me back if anything happens. Sure. I'll send you photos. - I'll talk to you later. - Ok. “Let's meet up and talk.” “When are you free?” You got my text. Why aren't you replying? I'm... Anyway, let's talk face to face. Call me. Your message has been recorded... Yoomi, are you going on leave starting tomorrow? Yeah, why? “Yoojung, your sister is going on leave. Is she planning to go somewhere?” That's from mom. I'm just going to stay home and rest. Tell her that yourself. Tell her to enjoy her trip with dad and stop worrying about me. She didn't ask you directly. That's a sure sign she's worried. About what? What's there to worry about? You and Taegyu, of course. Hey. I can handle my own relationship. Here goes my family again. Only because you never tell us anything. Because there's nothing to tell! Besides, it's not just any relationship. It's a long-distance relationship. I noticed you and Taegyu haven't been spending holidays together since last year. We take a trip together every year. Come on. His short business trip back to Korea doesn't count as one. My turn. Has it been that long already? Hello? Hey, Jinsung. It's me, Yoomi. Oh... hey! Is Taegyu with you now? No, we're both working away from the office today. By the way, long time no see. I know. How have you been? Wait, hang on. Are you in Japan? Right. Yeah. Just a short visit. Taegyu doesn't know I'm here yet. Is this another one of your surprise visits? The two of you are still so lovey-dovey. I haven't had a bite all day. Since transferring to this new department I've been totally stressed out. Tomorrow I'll have to... Hang on, Jinsung. Have you been to Taegyu's new place? No, that twerp hasn't invited me over yet even though he moved ages ago. Hell, I thought we were best buds. Jinsung, do you... happen to know his new address? Well, you work with him, don't you? Ok, sure. I'll ask him discreetly and text it to you. - Bye. - Yeah. - Thank you so much. - No problem! Yoomi. Yeah? Aren't you sick of studying? I'm not studying. Just practicing calligraphy. I'm imitating other people's work. I see. - Yoomi. - What? If he's ignoring your texts you should know what's coming next. Should I go visit? Go where? Japan? If you ask me if he hasn't been in contact for this long he's telling you he wants to end it. I think it's not a bad idea to end things by drifting apart like this. How could we? We're engaged! I think there's nothing to worry about. We've been dating for years. Sounds like you've made up your mind to go. Well, don't. Why would you go there Weren't there any signs that it was over? I don't know. I've been busy with my life too. I don't even know when this started. We planned a life together. We talked about when to have a baby and how our future house would be like. He was more excited about it than I was. Is this normal for couples who have been together forever? We do have a lot of memories together. It was fine even if we didn't talk every day because we knew each other so well. This is not an easy place to live. And it won't be easy to get you over. Still there must be a way. Or I can move here. Seriously? You promise? Promise! It's obvious. He got a job and a whole new world opened up before him. So he changed his mind. If we talk face to face... and I get him to explain why he didn't call... I'm sure he'll be sorry about it. I don't think it's anything serious. Excuse me. I'd like to go to this place. Go straight down and then left. Thank you very much. Coming! Sorry... you are? Does Taegyu live here? (In korean) Hello. Please come in. Please have a seat. Sorry. Please have a seat. Is it ok if I speak in japanese? Yes. At first, we told ourselves this would be just a fling while he's in Japan. But... The more time we spent together, the more we clicked. Taegyu said that he wanted to give you more time. And I agreed... But now... our parents have found out about us. And so... Since the last winter... we've been thinking about making it official. We've started on the preparations. What do you mean? We are... getting married. Taegyu needs to settle down. I'm home. How was your day? Yoomi. I thought you needed more time, so I... Sorry. I found my true love. Let go. I told you that was obviously what's going on. I knew that would happen. So why did you go there and took that crap? You should've trashed their place! When I went there... for a second, I thought it was a mistake. But she looked just like his mother. So... I just accepted it. I should've been there with you. You should've been half as harsh to them as you're to me. Don't stay there by yourself. Come home. Have you eaten? No. Why haven't you eaten? Before doing anything, eat first. Ok? Hang on. What, mom? I'm talking to Yoomi! Mom and dad don't know about it yet, right? What? No. I won't say anything. Don't worry. Can you give me a minute? I'll just have a few quick words with mom. Ok. Hello? Hello? - Hello - Miss? I'm sorry, but it's check-out time. Ok. He proposed to you, and now he does this. If you had spent any quality time together, I wouldn't be this mad. And those excuses about money and studying? He said he'd make it up to you in Japan! You said he wasn't a good fit for our family anyway. Right. It's great he won't be my son-in-law. I never liked that boy after you came home crying on your birthday. Yoojung said the same thing too. Give him a piece of your mind, hubby! Mom. Fine. All right... Come home quick, ok? My Lovely Mom The person you are calling isn't available. Please leave a message after the tone. Hey, I told you not to tell mom. I wanted to go back and break it to them myself. Why did you blab? Why is everyone making a fuss over nothing? Leave me alone! Give me some breathing space. For you who reached out To my fragile heart that was about to break How many times have I been saved By that smile on your face Adrift in the gentle breeze these flower petals carry my thoughts of you Will they ever reach you? Stand by me forever. You shouldn't kill yourself. What are you talking about? Don't mind him! What did I say wrong? Excuse me. - Hi. - Hello. Oh, hello. Please take a seat. What would you like to have? Coffee is fine. Ok. - Could you check upstairs? - Sure. Coffee. Good day to you. - Excuse me. - Yes? May I use the Wi-Fi? Oh, the Wi-Fi? I'm not good with smartphones. The password is the name of this place. - “End Point”. - I see. Are you busy? - Not really. - That's good to hear. Here's what I borrowed from you the last time. I owe you one. You're really good at this. Everyone loved it. I'm glad they liked it. - One more thing... - Sit down already. You talk to him every day. Don't you ever run out of things to say? Our bus leaves at one. Yeah, yeah... - Hi. - Oh, can I have my usual? - Same for me. - Ok. This was Sachiko's favourite flower, right? You can't visit her grave empty-handed. You're the best, Nishiyama. I didn't order the bread. It's complimentary. Mom: It was not meant to be. Let go of all the sorrow. I love you. - Coffee. - Coffee? That's the smell of miso toast! Miso toast again today? Yes, please! Good afternoon. Did you just get here today? Yes. She's just here for coffee. Oh, I see. I thought you came to stay. Only travellers and locals visit this café. Yes. Oh, I see. Wasn't that delicious? Oh, yes. Their miso toast is simply divine! - I get it. Just give me a minute. - Hurry. You're the best too, Béné. Come in. How long can I stay here? There won't be anyone else... after you. I'm closing up the place. You're most probably our last guest. Is this your first time in Nagoya? I'll bring up your luggage. It's my first time here by myself. Good morning! Good morning! - Here you go. - Thanks. It's nothing. Nishiyama! I brought this back. Thank you! Sorry, Manato. I need to go back in. I'm going to tuck in. Thanks. Hotaru. Are you sure you don't want anything to eat? It looks like your mom will be late. You're going to get hungry. What are you drawing? - Mom. - Your mom? In that case... here's your dad beside her. Nishiyama, may I have omelette rice? Sure, coming right up. (Mandarin) Good evening. - Did you find the store? - Yes, I did. She said she found the store. Oh, so you finally found it. I had to queue for a couple of hours. They had a lot of customers. Would you like something to drink? Thanks. Just plain water would do. Nishiyama. Aren't you closing shop at the end of the month? Why did you take in another lodger? Come to think of it I haven't seen her down here at all. Did she get here yesterday? She has been in her room for two days. Really? Nishiyama. I think you should check on her tomorrow. That's right. Doesn't hurt to be careful. If anything's wrong, we can help. Ok. Yoomi, are you awake? Yoomi? Yes. I made some vegetable soup. Feel free to come down if you're hungry. I'm good. Thank you very much. I'm good, I don't need anything. Yoomi, it's me. Isn't Nagoya nice? Yeah. I guess. Now that I've lived here for a while, I can say it's not easy to live in Japan as a korean. You seem different. Have you eaten? Yeah. You know what? Back in Korea, we'd ask, “Have you eaten?” as our way of saying hi, right? Yeah. But if I do that here they wonder why I asked them that. - Oh, really? - Yeah. But it's just a way of showing concern. Right? It counts as a greeting only in Korea. Cultural differences. Interesting, huh. I'm loving my life these days. I've met a few girls here. I think I'm actually quite popular in Japan. Thanks. Taegyu is an idiot. How did you know I'm here? You posted on your social media. Oh, I didn't know you follow me. I only uploaded a photo of this place. I see. So, you aren't following me... - I... - No, it's all right. This place is very popular in Nagoya. I'm glad to see you're doing ok. Jinsung? Jinsung, it's been a while! Oh, Nishiyama! How have you been? - How are you? - I'm good. You know each other? I stayed here too when I first came to Nagoya. I finally got to see you today. Sorry, and thanks for your concern. He's a really good guy. She's the same age as us, so you can relax and speak casually. - Oh, really? - I see. My break is over. I've got to go back. You speak japanese really well. Even better than I do. - Just go. - I'm leaving. Bye! - See you next time. - See you. - Bye. - Bye! Are you done with your coffee? Are you hungry? Want something to eat? When you got here, Jinsung gave me a call. He asked me not to charge you for anything. He was worried about you. I hope you get a good rest. Even though this alley is a dead end, a lot of folks have embarked on a new journey from here. Thank you. - Good afternoon! - Good afternoon. Miss Onigiri, come sit... - Some coffee for you? - Yes, please. Where are you off to today? I'm going to Nagoya Station after a cup of coffee. You come here every day? Don't you know? All the locals in this town co-own this place. What nonsense are you saying? Yoomi! This is Chen. She's from China and here on an onigiri tour. Isn't her nickname cute? Miss Onigiri. The girl who works here that never smiles? I call her “Miss Smile”. What should we call you? What do you think? - Here's your coffee. - Thanks. How do you like it? - It's good. - Good to hear. By the way, how did you become so fluent in japanese? I've visited Japan before and I studied the language hoping to move here. Oh, I see. Oh, but I can never get kanji. I know, kanji is difficult. Still, it's pretty impressive. I don't know any other languages besides japanese. You're thinking I'm dumb, aren't you? Of course not... How do you write my name in korean? - “Nishiyama”? - Yeah. Wait a moment... If you can... write on this. Please and thank you. Nishiyama Man, that looks so cool! My name looks really cool in korean. “Nishiyama”. Korean characters are beautiful. They sure are. Would you mind writing their names too? They will love it. - So beautiful! - I want one. Oh, it looks so cool! Yoomi! Yoomi! Could you do the signboard for me? You're asking for too much. That's not very nice. You shouldn't do that. What's wrong? Draw it somewhere here. Are you drawing an onigiri? An onigiri? No way! It's boring to stay cooped up in your room, right? Let's hang out more. Oh, it's done! Take a look at this! - I knew this would look better. - Awesome! Just the two of us? Do come again. - Here you go. - Thank you! Here. Thank you very much. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. - I'll come again. - Ok. You don't like flowers? I used to. How about now? Maybe because they wither so quickly. These days, no matter what I see I just feel detached. I'd like to feel a bit more detached. - What? - Oh! - Hey! - How have you been? It's been so long. How are you? I'm good. What are you doing here? Now? Lunch break. - You're office workers now? - Yeah. - See you around. - Ok, bye. Sorry. I forgot you were holding them. I'm so sorry. It's fine. That one on the left is my ex-girlfriend. What? How could you stay so friendly? Well, we ended things on good terms. That's usually the case for me. You'll be 30 in a few years, right? Yeah. Are you one of those confirmed bachelors? Where did you pick up that phrase? Well, I'm not a confirmed bachelor. I'm not dead set against marriage. I just don't see why I need to do it. I've dated my share of women. But you know, it can be quite a chore. Filling out paperwork and what not. How does someone who finds that a chore run a café? Touché. Well... a café doesn't whine like a girlfriend will. But running a café is work. Isn't it odd to equate work with love? You can't do that. Come to think of it, you're right. Sorry. Apology accepted. Don't tell this to anyone. So the one on the left is my ex, right? The other one is my ex-ex-girlfriend. What? Just kidding! - Sheesh! - Of course, it's a joke. I almost believed you! Yoomi! - Oh, good morning. - Good morning. Nishiyama! Do you have a minute? Come here... Yoomi, where are you going? Well, I'm going to the beach. - Is it far from here? - No. Yoomi, may I tag along? Do you want a lift? Hop on... I'd like to go here. Oh, the beach house. - I know where that is. - Thanks. Is it a tourist spot? Yeah, in the summer. It's the sea... I'll be free after picking up my kids. Call me if you get lost. Ok. Thank you very much. Come here. Chuunichi Beach House Yoomi, is everything ok? I love this place. Try this. It's really delicious. Right? - Yoomi. Good evening. - Good evening. Is there something you need? Nishiyama has left for the day. May I use that? The detergent. - Yes, that. - Go ahead. Thank you. - Miss Smile. - Yes? Nishiyama is off seeing his father, isn't he? Is that so? Kojima. Time sure flies. Feels just like yesterday when Nishiyama was found, right? Yeah. It was during the Nagano Olympics, right? I envy him a little sometimes. Everyone felt sorry for him and even gave him this café for free. You shouldn't say that. Hey, have a look at this! It's the article from back then. “Neglected, malnourished child found” - Wow. - Right? You can find this information online now. Really? Why did you keep this newspaper clipping? You have no idea what Nishiyama means to us. We've looked after him since he was a child. I'm heartbroken that he's moving to Tokyo. Good night, Yoomi! You're just sad because finding Nishiyama was the most exciting thing that happened and now he's leaving. You talk too much! Neglected... Béné, have you been to the TV tower? - No, I haven't. - I went there 50 years ago! 50 years ago? I wasn't even born yet! Back when TV was black-and-white? You can see the Nagoya Castle from there. Yoomi! Good morning. - Good morning... - How are you? Good morning. Oh, you're up. - What's going on? - We're going on a day trip. Since Nishiyama will be leaving soon. - Ok! Let's go. - Let's go. - Let's go. - See you! Want to come along? Which way? Lead us there... Wow, what a view! This is awesome. You can see everything. - Is that the Nagoya Castle? - Over there. The Nagoya Castle is over there. You can really see it from here. Because the weather is fine today. Wow! The view up here is amazing. - Yoomi... come join us. - Come here. That's where Nishiyama's café, End Point, is. - That's the way we came. - Oh, yes. You can see the park from here. Yeah. That mountain behind the yellow building. That's where Nishiyama was found, right? You're right... The weather is good, so the visibility's great. Yeah, we can see all the way there. It's a miracle how he has grown into the well-adjusted young man he is today. You're right... But we brought him up since he was eight. I'm kind of a living news story. I'm well aware I came this far because of everyone's help. But I do find it a bit annoying sometimes. I'm like everyone else really. So what if my childhood was a little sadder and different from everyone else's? You're leaving for Tokyo soon, aren't you? Aren't you sad to be leaving your hometown? Well, I am. I see this as embarking on a new journey. It's time to start a new chapter. I don't think my father... was so strange. He simply had a different way of looking at things. To be honest, it wasn't as tragic as the news said. All the attention was on finding a malnourished ten-year-old. But my father was starving too. How is he now? I see him sometimes. He's a bit of an eccentric. He's an interesting man. To be honest, what bugged me more was the pity I got from everyone. I see. You're very mature in your thinking. And you're doing well. Come to think of it, I've led a really sheltered life. You were brought up in a good environment. There's no shame in that. You should use it to your advantage. - What? To my advantage? - Yeah. After you go back, you'll meet someone new and get happily married. Stay close to your parents and hang out with your sister like you always do. Stand where you are and draw a giant circle around yourself. He's just one person who stepped out of your circle. There are plenty more folks in your life. He had been a part of the future I had envisioned for myself for so long... That... I couldn't imagine otherwise. Loving him... and being loved by him. Just the two of us. I thought we would step into our thirties, hand in hand. Now I have to start all over again. I know you're going through a really hard time and I have no intention of trivialising it. But it's good to remember that everyone has their own problems. There are people with bigger problems than us. We're so much luckier than them. That's nothing to be ashamed of. Right? You're right. I guess this is meant to happen. It's just that I don't have a new plan in my pocket yet. I'm just taking a break for now. Hold it. You have “plans in your pocket”? You're supposed to “make” plans. - I know you make them. - Right? But I like the idea of having plans stored in my pocket. Is there one in there now? No, I said I don't have a plan yet! I imagine you with bulging pockets... - full of plans. - What are you guys doing? Seems like they're having a good time. It's good to be young! - Look... - It's good. Let me have a look. Nice... Korean kimchi pancakes! - I want to try it. - Wow! - Looks delicious. - Let me grab a bite. - Thank you, Yoomi. - Please enjoy. I've always wanted to try korean food made by a korean. - Thank you. - Thank you! Are you happy? I'm tucking in... Have you heard this phrase before? (Speaking in french) (In mandarin) I don't know what you're saying. What are you two saying? Simply put... If food doesn't taste good, it's not food! Can we eat while you talk? I'm starving! Try this as well! It's a french dish. You'll love it. - I'm tucking in... - Here. Cheers! - Wow, incredible! - Lovely! She's a hard act to follow. - So who's up next? - Who shall it be? Miss Smile? I practiced this song with Miss Smile. I can't wait. It's not a japanese song. I'm going to sing a song by a band called Busker Busker. What? The korean band? How do you know their songs? (In korean) Oh, I'm korean. Love cannot happen by saying “I love you”, I guess My predictable words are hurting you Words easily said and an easy love are all lies Yes, they are all lies What I want and how hard it is You don't even care Did I treat it like it doesn't matter again? Has it been difficult? Today you're saying you want to break up If you really love me Please wait for me And hold it back for yourself Your actions are turning into painful memories If you really love me If you really love me - Are there any other reasons why? - Hm? Other than the feelings you still have for him. Some reason why you can't let go. Are you talking about my ex? Well... Maybe the money I lent him? How much was it? Ten million won? About a million yen? - One million yen? - Yes. Hang on. That's a lot of money to be lending someone you're not married to. I guess. It totally is. But... We needed money for the wedding. So I was saving up for that. When he found a job here in Japan I lent him the money to buy a car. I thought we'd both be using the car anyway. I even picked out the car with him. You can be such an idiot. I know. With that one million yen, I could have travelled around the world. There's so much I could have done. But I don't want to see him ever again. I'm not staying here for that money. I don't even want it back. I think I just needed to get it off my chest. I'm happy enough just spending time here like this. You should get the money back. Will you get it back for me? - What? - You can have it if you do. This is what I dislike about folks who have never been broke. One million yen isn't a small amount. I feel much better having talked about it. Want some coffee? It will keep you up all night. I'll be ok. All right. Here. - This one? - Help yourself. Let me get you some sweets too. Oh, thanks. By the way, how do you make miso toast? With a couple of ingredients. That's not what I'm asking. Teach me the recipe. I want to make some too. No way! The recipe is my trade secret. I'll never tell you! I knew it. So cheap. Am I? Nishiyama. I think I'll be heading home now that I've cleared my mind somewhat. Really? I'm sorry for what happened to you but it was really nice having you around. I enjoyed my time here too. I really wish I could stay longer. Although I was a complete stranger I had a lovely time here because everyone was so warm and friendly. I'm glad that's how you feel. Have you booked your air ticket? Not yet. I'll do it later. As long as we're alive, we'll meet again. All right then. How about some miso toast? Oh, you're going to teach me the recipe? - No. - Fine. Toast, please. Dear Nishiyama... What's wrong? I thought you had quit smoking. No kissing after smoking. Sheesh. Hey, come on. - Taegyu! - You startled me! Hi. - You followed me here? - No. I'm here to warn you never to upset my sister again. What's the matter with you two? You guys win. What do you mean by that? What? There are so many places I want to go. Let's go to all of them. But one day won't be enough. I wanted to go so bad... Count me in! - Don't leave me behind! - Hey. Let's go. Let's go! - Let's go! You get off. - You get off. - No. - You little brat. Let's go! Oh, what's going on? What's this? You stole his car? I asked him for the one million yen and he gave me his car instead. Together with all the paperwork. What? Why? Why did you... - How? Did you see him in person? - Yeah. I told him to pay you back but he said he didn't have that much spare cash. So I told him to give you the car. He agreed right away. He wasn't as bad as I thought. I expected him to react far worse. I can't believe he just handed you his car. Maybe he thought you were with the yakuza. Of course not. When you were over at his place, he was so taken aback he didn't know how to react. He said he was sorry about what he had done. He said he'd feel better by doing this. I've brought you the car, ma'am. So how about a quick ride? No, I'm good. - Come on. - No. It probably smells like them. - Just hop in there! - No, I don't want to. You haven't seen much of Nagoya. It smells nice. Thanks. Anyway, about that guy... I don't think he knows you at all. And to think we dated for four years. I bet he wasn't much of a listener, right? I didn't think he was that kind of a guy... No. I know his type. He's clueless about all that's precious hidden deep in the human heart. All that's precious in the human heart? What are you going to do with this car? Sell it? This car won't fetch you a million yen but you can recoup a few hundred thousand. It's fine. - Flatten it? - Yeah. - You want to scrap it? - Yeah. Let's do that. - You want to? - Yes! - Ok... - Awesome. Hey, Nishiyama. Kaja. Kaja. Is that korean for let's go? - Yes. Let's go. - Kaja! He's using the bowls to make music. Bowls of different shapes and sizes to produce different tones. What a sight! Indeed. Thank you for everything. I should thank you too. So beautiful. A memento of your best moments in words “We all have something precious hidden deep within our hearts.” Here you go. - Bye. - Bye. - Hi. - Hi. - Which one do you want? - This one. - This one? - This one? - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Bye. Yoomi! Hey! I'll be right with you! Yoomi, do your colleagues know how good you are at this? No. Do I need to tell them? I enjoy doing it for free. Why? I just think it's pretty amazing. I used to think people who are artistic have their heads in the clouds. But you're the most practical person I know. And you're doing this. What happened to you in Japan? Hey, try this. What's that? - Miso toast. - Miso? Soybean paste toast? - Here. - No! It's a famous recipe! Try it. - Isn't it good? - So good. So bitter. Everyone tells me I'm talented but they always pass me over. What am I lacking? Yoojung, you're beautiful. I know. I'm talking about on the inside. Hey... I mean it. You have something precious tucked away in your heart and if they can't see it, it's fine to cut them out of your life. Just stand where you are and slowly build your circle of friends. You're more than capable of doing so. It's your life after all. Hey. Come here. Where? Come on! My feet are getting dirty! - It'll taste a lot better here. - No... Doesn't it feel good? Not bad. Doesn't this feel great? Thanks, Yoomi. Even now, the memories of those days arise from deep inside my heart and warm me up. I didn't realise until it was over. I had found true happiness. Inside the home at the dead end of an alley on the second floor with a small window. I could hear the rumbling of trains passing by in the distance. The space downstairs was full of warmth. The sound of laughter reverberating across the room. “To Nishiyama” “Thank you, Nishiyama. I believe we'll meet again. Yours, Yoomi.” I found true happiness in the darkest days of my life. I'll miss the scenery of that day. Editing & Timing: Gus Quality Checking: Esai Special thanks to Ken Support Choi Sooyoung! Anticipate her upcoming drama, Run On Support Choi Sooyoung!
