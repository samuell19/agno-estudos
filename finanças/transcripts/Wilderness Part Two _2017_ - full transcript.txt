Come on, let's go. Okay!　You've got a good lead. That's pretty good. Isn't it good today? This is it. This is it. Whoa, whoa... whoa. Go, go, go! It's a straight shot from here. Hey, hey, hey! Hey!　You're not supposed to fall behind, idiot! Oh, I can't do this anymore. Oh... Aah! Shit. I just lost. And that was just the first race. Oh, no... What's written on both sides of this? Parents' names... Parents? Yes. Why do they do that? Horses win and horses lose. It's all about bloodlines. What? Then there's no meaning to the race. It's so obvious. Who'd be stupid enough to buy another ticket? Hey I'm right here What's the point of life if you can't live up to the expectations you were born with? Next one, next one. I can come back from this! Which horse should we go with this time? Oh, I think this is good All right, keep going, keep going, keep going! Hit it!　Go for it! Go for it! Don't let them get past you! Don't let them get past you! Yes!　Yes! Yay! Horses don't run because they're trying to kick the crap out of their fate. It's the same with humans. We all want to win our destiny. Well, as I like to say, counter your fate with a "bang"! It's a one-shot KO win. Yay! We won!　We did it! Yes! Yes! Counter! I'm the counter! I'm the counter! Your target is impressive What? He wins a race, and he's one of the most popular horses in the world. Shinjuku Ah... Ouch, ouch... Ugh... huh... huh... Ugh... What?　Oh... Ah, ah, ah... so-so-so... somebody! Pl-pl-pl... please help me! Keiko-chan! Oh, no... Are you okay? H-H-Hospital... someone call for an ambulance. A-A-are you okay?　Are you okay? phone, phone, phone. How ironic. Right now, there's more business for the dying than the living. Wedding halls are closing down and being replaced by funeral homes. It's the final pleasure for the elderly who have nothing better to do with their money. Inviting musicians and celebrities to the funeral. I see. I'll take the southeast exit I've decided to build a funeral home like a theme park. ...and there's an abandoned factory in district 5 It's a gym now, isn't it? Yes, we have two professionals. My predecessor rented it to me cheaply because he didn't want me to leave it idle. My dad? Yes. Yeah, I liked it. The last generation had this. Can you close it down? We'll use it as a funeral home warehouse. The gym? Yes Urgh!　Shit! Shiny shoe guy! How dare you look down on me. I've been doing business in Shinjuku since before he even had any hair! A brothel turned into a elder care home. A wedding hall is now a funeral hall. The only things that haven't changed are this place and the ramen shop. My dick ain't gonna change, damn it! Son of a bitch. Goddamn it! Whoa! Next, Mr. Fuyuki. Thank you for today. A-a-are you okay? She's fine, but... The baby, didn't make it What's wrong with Michiko? Is she leaving?

Sorry Bring me a cart. -Okay. A new client is coming here at 2:00. You haven't changed. There's a new client coming to check out the place. Was my father heavy when you were carrying him? He was cold. It's like I came back to a desert. For years. Every day, I felt like... I was sick of it. I can't believe he hanged himself to death. coward That's just how he was, wasn't it? I've decided to live. And ditch a ten-year-old kid. You carry a dead old woman on your back and you get all sentimental Oh... that guy Kenji from your gym. He's the son of the man who drove your father to suicide. I checked. That's the son of a murderer. I'm... I'm not apologizing to you. I'm... I just wanted to live! To Shinji, from Kyoko "Despair of the returning soldiers" "Kyoko, wife of the late Hisamitsu Sawamura..." "named and shamed Second Lieutenant N." "My husband was severely beaten by N during his deployment." "without adequate medical care at the time." "He suffered the post-traumatic stress and killed himself." "This was a murder by N..." "It was murder." (GONG) Shinji What?　Just... Mmm! (both breathing heavily) When I'm with a guy... It's like a demon wants to come out I thought I would go crazy I smiled while I watched So I try to catch the demon, but he gets away. And you, with a single blow... What's your mother like? I came from temporary shelter. Temporary? I am a victim 3/11? Yeah. My friends and relatives were all swept away... I lived in temporary housing most of my life. But... I ran away from my mom. Yoshiko. Wait. This is all that's left. Hey. Let's go out sometime. And invite Barikan along. We can go to the beautiful ocean. Here we go. Aah... You're a good man, big brother. I feel refreshed, thanks to you. Hahahaha... I don't care. What? I don't care, big brother Yeah... (elevator dings) Hey, you know... humans are originally... born as a half-dead corpse. And then it takes a lifetime to become a complete corpse. Did you know that? No. You didn't know? This old man's almost perfect. Oh, here. Dear Shinji, Mr. Takeo Niki has offered to meet with you. I will not be there, but if you want to know more about your father, please go to Tokufukuji Temple at June 3rd, 10am Kyoko Sawamura Family Grave I'm Sawamura. Uncle. I'm Niki. Are you alone? My mom doesn't want to see you. I have cancer. I don't have much longer. So, I have a message for your mother. If she could allow me the privilege of telling her... Big brother... Does your son know about the cancer? Kenji... Do you know my son? He's my best friend. He's a pro boxer. Barikan Kenji A boxer? You've got the wrong guy. That coward... You're everything I thought you'd be. I'm leaving. Sawamura-kun... He tried to flee his post. We took discipinary action Two weeks in detention. Why did my dad run away?

The government's ruling party... has proposed a bill to amend the Community Service Program Act which came into effect last year for scholarship recipients is now a mandatory system instead of a voluntary one Can you eat, Uncle? In response, the opposition parties... have voiced a series of criticisms, claiming that it violates Article 18 of the constitution and is a form of conscription. I've decided. to join the Self-Defense Force I'll go wherever uncle went, even the desert. You should choose to take care of yourself. Caregiving is... is a dirty job.

Haha In the beginning I really enjoyed just beating people up. And then, eventually, I developed a technique. It's been fun pursuing it. But the final question is. It's all about what you want in boxing. Why are you boxing? Barikan, if you want to box... No, in your case... If you really want to change yourself, Up. Aim high In boxing, you have to beat your opponent. Beat him. Beat him. Beat him. And only one of you can be champion. You're good kid. Wouldn't you like to be a champion? But it's impossible. Shinji, he's the one you've got to take down. I feel refreshed. Ha-ha-ha... Huh... Huh... L-l-losing weight i-i-is hard? It's the same in any sport. It's unsightly to be the loser. I hate people who don't win. I hate guys with no luck. I'm not gonna be like my dad. Absolutely not. If someone is trying to kill me... I'm gonna kill them first! (breathing heavily) Aah!　Huh!

I don't want to be spoiled. It's just... I wanted to hang on to that feeling, you know? What are you talking about? I don't care how much you hate me. You can't win against someone who stands in the sun. That's the way it is. You know that, right?　You don't get it. Shinji You have to understand! I don't get it! Then you two can keep making out! You'll see. I'll kill him! (clicks tongue) Please take good care of yourself. Shinji, are you here? Shinji? Oh... How long have you been in pain? I'm sorry. I'm on a diet. You can smell it.
