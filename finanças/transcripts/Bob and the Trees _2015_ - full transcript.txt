MATT: It's a beauty, man. Are you still gonna do those two for firewood? Yeah, just looking to see what was over here. I don't want to take too much. Wow, that is something there. See dude, this is what I'm telling ya is way up by Spectacle Lake. Is that a poplar back there? It is. A tulip? I don't know, I got to-- I don't know. Let's go look, man. I think it is a poplar. First of all, a poplar, what's poplar good for? MATT: Floors. (LAUGHTER) BOB: Besides floors. It's the number one food source tree for the ruffed grouse. Remy! (WHISTLING) Come on, bud. I'm liking lump sum. Is there anybody else chasing after this wood lot? We don't know. I mean what if there are and our bid's too low? I mean, we tally these numbers. We're gonna have big numbers if we split it 50-50. You know. It's what we've always done. It's how we've always done business. Yeah. Alright. Diesel fuel four bucks a gallon. Just for starters. Bar and chain, 17 dollars a gallon. I know how much everything costs, Dad. There's gonna be a lot of money. You saw the oak that we tallied. 18 inch, 20 inch, 22 inch, 24 inch. It's filled. So everything goes up except the cos-- the price of loggin'? -You said this guy... -I've been doing this 30 years. I've been doing this 30 years. I'm the forester. All right? So I'm telling you, this doesn't come up-- How many times have we had a shot like this? Yeah. You said that he's got-- I don't know, how many acres on the other side of the road. If this cut goes well, we do okay 50-50, maybe next time we can take those profits and offer him a lump sum for however many acres are over here. You know, just do like a little tester over here first. -You know... -Play... Get Leland used to us. -Play it safe. -Play it safe. MAN: Perfect. All right, sweet, thank you very much. -LADY: Have a good day. -MAN: You too. BETHANY: Hi, Bob. How are you? Good, how are you, Bethany? I'm doing fine, thanks. What can I do for you today? Well, I need a check-- certified check for $25,000 and I'm thinking my savings account should be able to do that. Okay, let me pull that up for you, Bob. (TYPING) Bob at this time you don't have $25,000 in that account. BOB: Hmm. Is there another account you wanted it to come from? Maybe... How about my checking account and savings? Can we get there? (TYPING) Without like... you know, draining them both dead. If I do a combination of both we can do it so I wouldn't have to close an account. -Is that okay? -Yes, nice. Yes, definitely. I'll be right back for you. (COW MOOING) BOB: I need a dish, buddy. -BOB: I got you. -LADY: Hi. MATT: Yeah, just take some breast and a wing. BOB: Couple wings actually.

Quilled by the porcupine. I almost got porcupined. I was marking timber. I swear to god, man. MATT: You know those things are pretty slow, right? It wasn't about... LADY: They're everywhere though. BOB: It wasn't about being slow. They're all-- everywhere you look there's a fucking porcupine, right. MATT: What, were you chasing it? No, I was marking timber. And right up against the boundary and I got to mark this other tree and I look down and there's a porcupine underneath me, right next to my leg. And I'm about to mark this tree and I went... with his back out ready to get me. I wasn't-- I was inches away from this thing and if I'd have just went and continued to mark the stump, you know, how I mark... Yeah. Four feet and I mark the stump. If I marked the stump, I'd of whacked this thing with my leg. I'd of got porcupined. LADY: Why didn't you tell me about this when it happened? BOB: Cause it didn't happen. I mean, I didn't get porcupined. Still. It's scary. Yeah, I mean how about me coming home with a leg full of quills. -I mean, I... -We'd take you to vet. (LAUGHTER) You would. Did you guys see those cops over down at the farm down the street? -Daldidge farm? -LADY: Yeah. I guess what happened was a skunk bit a pig and... Rabid skunk. They had to cut the pigs head off and they tested it and the pig had rabies. So they got a positive rabies alert. The whole town's up in arms and the state came in and put a quarantine on their farm. And just messed their lives up. It's like no meat, no animals in, no animals out for six months. Yeah, they basically gave them two options. Like raise them through the quarantine for six months which costs a fortune. LADY: Right. Or just dig a big hole and kill 'em all. Kill 'em all. -Mass, dig a mass grave. -LADY: Yeah. And from what I heard, he asked-- He said to the state vet-- He goes... He said to the state vet, he goes, "So you're giving me only one option. The only thing I can do now is kill all my animals and dig a mass grave and, 'cause I can't afford it." And he goes, "Yeah, we'll let you do that." Fucking dude was like, "Thanks a lot," you know. "Thanks for hooking me up." That's why I'm worried about if it comes here. Right? What do we got? We got 31 pigs out there. -MATT: Yeah. -Prime. They quarantine our farm right now. MATT: Remy's got his rabies shot. Right? Remy does, yeah. So just put him on the job. (LAUGHTER) Let him rule. (DOG BARKING) Idiots! (DOG BARKING) What is it? What's going on, buddy? (DOG BARKING) (DOG GROWLING) (DOG BARKING) (BOBCAT ENGINE RUNNING) This is a harvest in a wetland. We're not gonna touch it. We're gonna work around it.

POLLY: I don't. (SIGHS) I do. Well, we're not getting one. I'm gonna look into it anyway. They can't be that expensive. They don't do anything. They just guard-- they're good guard animals.

Ants. I know. I got ants too. Like I don't know, three of the last 10 trees I cut. This firewood tree. There's a seam that goes like 15 feet up this tree. It's full of fucking ants. The hell's going on, man? I don't know. Maybe this property's so wet. Too much water in the ground. The shit's rotten. It's rotten. When you start losing oak, you start losing everything. -Well, yeah. -Everything. You need to call Leland and just talk to him. See if we can try another parcel on the other side of the road and... just tell him, explain to him it's fucked. We're not getting out of the job. Why can't we get out of the job? I mean, we're in partnership with Leland. We're not getting out of the job. Sharing the profits. If there's no profit, there's no profit to share. We got a job to do. We're not getting out of the job. I'm telling you. There's just not getting out of this job. It sucks, but we're not getting out of it. Do you want to keep cutting rotten ant infested wood? We have to. Why? Trust me, we have to. Why the fuck do we have to? 'Cause I already paid for the fucking timber man. I already paid him, I paid him a lump sum. I paid him. It's not your problem. It's my problem. We got to finish this job. How much did you fucking pay him? I bought the job man, I bought it. -How much?! -25 grand. I gave him 25 grand. All right? So we're sticking this out. We're sticking this out, we're finishing this job. 'Cause I'm not losing $15,000 'cause we're walking off the job. You follow me? We wouldn't be losing anything if you fucking listened to me. Why-- why the fuck did you do that? We were gonna share the profits. Dude, it isn't your problem, man. MATT: It is my problem. It is my problem. This shit happens all the time. -Really? -Yeah. All the time to you 'cause you don't fucking listen. You take a chance, fucking shit happens. Great, take a chance. What did I tell you I didn't want to do? Take a chance. Good job! Whose business is this? Oh, who's been doing this for 30 fucking years? Yeah. You always fucking say that. Who owns this business, man? You do. Congratulations.

What were you doing there? Feeding the pigs and watching the... Just feeding the pigs? -Yeah. -That's all you were doing? ANDY: Yeah, I was feeding them. Remember that cow you told me about? BOY: Yeah. Hole like this in its neck, bleeding like crazy. You didn't-- you didn't see nothing happen? No, I just... MAN: Hey, Bob. What's up, man? Somebody's fucking with my cows. Somebody who? BOB: I don't know, I don't know. Whoa, whoah. What's that got to do with him? I don't know. I just-- maybe he saw something. I don't know. He was there. MAN: What do you mean someone's fucking with your cows? He was there the other day. He was there the other day. He said, "Your cow's bleeding, and he said, "I got to go." So, I'm just trying to make sense man. Looks like this cow was... Hey, did-- did you see anything? ANDY: No. Did you ask him? What did he say? He, he's over there helping you out man. He didn't do anything to your cow. It could be anything, right. Could be an animal messing with it. Could be, I don't know, maybe it has rabies. This thing's got a puncture wound in its neck. It's-- I don't know what it is. I don't know. Just calm down, man. We'll keep an eye out, okay? Yeah man. Sorry man, I... MAN: He's... I just... I know man. Just take it easy. Go home and chill out. -Andy, you all right buddy? -Yeah, yeah. Hey, Bob. -Hey Nat, how are ya? -Good man. Good to see you. Been a while. -Hi. -Hey, I'm Nat Leland. -How are ya? -I'm Matt, nice to meet you. Get inside the house. Touch day out there, huh? MATT: Yeah, windy. BOB: That's putting it mildly. Oh my god, it's so windy up here. I didn't even leave the house today. (LAUGHTER) Better you than me out there. BOB: Sorry about the mess here, bud. Oh, it doesn't make any difference. -Come on, we'll sit back here. -Yeah? Right on, right on. You just get up here? You didn't drive in this storm to get up here? No, no I've been here a couple days. 'Cause I know there was like, it was like crazy... I came up, you remember two weekends ago when we had that huge storm? BOB: Yeah. The one just before now? Yeah. I drove up in that. I usually get here for three or four days. Yeah. I don't put the full week in any more in New York, so... BOB: Oh. You know, I try to get here for a handful of extra days. BOB: That's good. Yeah, it was bad. BOB: I was thinking that maybe we might not get a chance to see ya, you know, if you left with the storm coming. I don't understand how you log in this storm. It's actually the best time of year to do it. I mean, the trails are frozen. Yeah, there's a lot of snow, but you know, other times of year you're dealing with mud, you're dealing with rain. It's just always something. Bugs are crazy in the spring. For us it's, I mean this snow is a little bit extreme, I got to say. Right? I mean this has been... But you got to cut, I mean you're still cutting at the ground? BOB: Yeah we got to dig in this... How you get to it? I mean a lot of times you can just stomp it down with your foot but now it's starting to get real deep. Starting to get deep where we're digging trees out. You know, we got to get to the bottom of them. Actually the most valuable part of the tree is from, is the first eight feet. Oh yeah, makes sense. -It is. -I guess. But the snow definitely slows us down. Slows down production. Yeah. MATT: You know. So tell me, tell me how it's going. How's the job going? Uh man, it's... it's good. I mean we're-- we're just-- we're killing it. We got the right weather for it. The trees are amazing, the oak is incredible. Maybe we're half done. We just... You're half done? I-- I don't know. I thought, I kind of expected you to be done. I mean it's not that it matters. It's okay, I mean 'cause I-- we're not going out there. We don't need to be there but... I thought you were further along than that. You want some more coffee? Yeah, they'd be great. -Yeah. -Little more? Yeah, heat it up. -Sure, I'll -Just a touch. I'll see if I can find some more cookies too. You ate all the cookies. Yeah, that was easy. Why the fuck are you telling him the trees are good? Tell him they're junk. Just tell him. -Now why? -Just tell him they're junk. Don't worry about it. (SIGHS) I'm not gonna-- I'm not gonna get into that with him right now. He got his dough. -It's not... -We're already... He's not-- yeah but that's not his problem. Why do you have to lie to him? You gonna tell him the trees are good? Why am I gonna do that for? You think he's gonna give me money back? 'Cause the trees fucking suck. You think he's gonna go, "Oh the trees suck. Here, here's your money Bob." You want, "You're not getting everything out of it. Here have another, here's 10 grand. I feel for you. No man, that wasn't the deal. Don't you sweat it. Don't worry about it and calm down. Okay. -MATT: Thank you. -Mm-hm.

Nah, I don't want no beer. I want to know what the fuck? Why he's giving me a wood lot full of ants. Was this a piece of shit you didn't want? Look, you're a professional...

BOB: I'm a professional? - You are a professional. - I'm a professional? You don't think I'm gonna trust you? I'm gonna go out there and start pounding on trees? -I figured... -Hey, you know... Professional or not. Like I said, you know, you know what you're getting into. This-- don't pin it on me, man. BOB: Yeah, yeah. Here's your cut. Here's your cut of Leland job.

Worse, what if Mr. Leland comes out here? You're gonna lose all that acreage on the other side of the road. You gonna turn me in? MATT: Maybe I should 'cause you're fucking crazy right now. You gonna turn me in? Listen... You know what's really funny is that you somehow justify this as redeeming yourself for your fuck up. Go. Drag your ass. -MATT: Fine. -Go. MATT: You want to pull this shit, you're gonna pull it by yourself. Just go. (CHAIN SAW RUNNING) No good. No good. Fucker's rotten too. Sorry. It ain't a big one but it's something.

I was hoping you'd come back to me. I hope you will. I miss you, man. And if this isn't feeling better in 48, 72 hours, please, please give me a call. And I'll be by in a couple of weeks to see you again and check that wrist. See how it's looking. But this is nothing to fool around with. This, you know, could have implications for your work life for many years to come. So take it seriously and we'll give you prescription for the x-ray and they can call my office with the result. Okay, you have any questions for me? (STORE LOUDSPEAKER) (CLICK SEATBELT) (SIGHS) Morning. Hey, how's it going? How you feeling? I'm all right. It's cool, Dad. I got it. I got it. You working your way from the back up to the front? -Yep. -Yeah? Matt you know... I don't think I need the gravel. I'm just gonna leave this here. It's... you don't have to do this the rest of your life, man. We've been at this so long. We never make any money. (SIGHS) We're always waiting for that next job to make a bunch of money. It's gonna be great. And it never is. It never has been. And you're young. You know, you don't need to live the same way I have. You know, hand to mouth your whole life. You could still do something else. I know you've been bit by sawdust. I know it's in your blood. It's tough. But man, I don't-- You're young, you know? You don't have to keep in this stinking business. Yeah? What do you suggest I do? Got any ideas? (SIGHS) I don't know. I have no clue. No, I have nothing. (CHUCKLES) The hell else is there to do around here? Don't worry about it, Dad. Just get better, heal up. Yeah. Don't you get hurt like me. Don't you do anything foolish out there. I'll be all right. Come on, come on, let's go. (COWS MOOING) Come on. Come on, come on, mama. Come on. Let's go, let's go. Come on. Come on, Ginger. Come on, girl. Come here. It's all right, it's okay. It's okay. You're gonna be okay, girl. I'm gonna make sure of it. (GUNSHOT) (CHAINS CLANKING) (RAZOR BLADE CUTTING THROUGH FAT) (SIGHS) (CHAINS CLANKING) (SAW RUNNING) She's gone. (CRYING) I'm sorry, Polly. I missed you. (SNIFFLING) (WATER SLOSHING) Here you go, Jose. Here you go, buddy. Go ahead. I know you've been waiting for that. (SIGHS) RADIO: The words leading experts on climate change are sounding a warning about global warming and its impact on the world economy. A hotter planet they say will be more difficult for growing enough food. NPR Dan Charles reports that scientists say that farmers are already seeing the effects of increased temperatures. (DOOR CLOSING) BOB: Morning. Morning. Feeling good? Yeah, pretty good. MATT: Ready to do this? Yeah, what's been-- what's happening here? So far so good. Got two loads out to Johnny. BOB: Wow. Pulled it all off the top of the mountain. BOB: Holy crap. I mean, the first load went for 2,500 bucks. -Yeah. -Awesome, well done. I'm just fucking glad to be off of that old property, man. This is a load of firewood. Just gotta make a little skid trail that's going off to the side here and I had to cut a lot of small shit to make... So you made three loads in two weeks already? Well, I got to top off this firewood load, but... -BOB: Wow. - Yeah. -BOB: That's impressive. -Yeah, it's going good. Few more trees left to take up there just to get the trail all the way over. -Saw's on the skidder. -Mm-hm. MATT: There's a huge flat section of pine down here and it looks like it drains pretty good. I'm thinking about trying to save that for the springtime and maybe we can work it in the mud. I don't know. But it's a little ace in the pocket maybe. (SIGHS) â™ª (SINGING ALONG TO THE SONG FROM RADIO) â™ª
