The undefeated favorites... team doesn't seem to playing their usual game. With less than a minute left, they're still trailing by five points. We gotta double right. 36 slam on... read. Break! Gonna win this game and make it score. They have the ball deep in their own territory. Quarterback Pat... number ten is calling the play. He almost drops the ball, but he makes the hand off to star running back number 45, John Carluccio. All right. That was good now. That was good. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to run a slot left, passed 69, double in. What's the matter, John? John? Hey, ref! Ref! Need a time. There's a time out on the field. The quarterback is motioning to the refs. John Carluccio, number 45, the driving force behind this amazing team is leaving the field. Lane? Lance, where are you? Right here. All right. Another $150 bucks. I should have bought stock in the company. 36... Go ahead. ...backup running back is coming into the game. What's the matter? You all right? Come on, come on. Will you hurry up? ...it's all right? ...batteries went dead. Thank god. You all right now? Can you hear? All right. Come here. Now get back in there. John Carluccio comes running back on the field and his replacement number 31 Lance... disappointedly leaves the field. Guess you don't get much playing time serving backup to John Carluccio. Lance must be a pretty frustrated young man about this time. Hut! The clock ticking away, quarterback Pat ...fades back and throws a... pass to number 45, John Carluccio. Carluccio makes it down to the... one yard line. First down... high! Hey, how about that pass, huh? What do you mean pass? It was a great catch. He's making Pat look good. All right, well, they're a pretty good combination, huh? Here's the play. The quarterback... is taking them all around him himself. He's got the whole team out in front, ...Carluccio does a great run. Touchdown! ...does it again! Winning another game... keeping their undefeated record intact. Looks like for the first time ever, ...is gonna have a winning team! Way to go, guys! We'll see you at the championship game. You can bet on it, Gary, if I have anything to do with it. Fat chance! Christ? Hey, bro, who won the game? High. What is this? Another set of wheels? You know my old lady, man. She married some rich old dude in Houston. This is my wedding gift. Hey, say hello to... Hi. Chris, where have you been? Haven't seen you too much lately. Vacationing. Where? Take a guess. Alcatraz. It's close. State Country Club for Boys. Well, that figures. Yeah, I finally make the big time. If you need me, I'm back. He's a real clown. Wasn't that Jimmy's boy? Yeah. His father's serving time. Yes. Chris is all right. Eh, just don't turn your back on him. Bravo... bravo. ...what do you say we gt something to eat? Well, son, you still play like an amateur. But you eat like a pro. You just quit, do you? Quit? Why quit? Well, at least your grandson plays like Virtuoso. No thanks to you. Pat, two minutes, man! Mom? Dad? Bye. Hey, kid? Pat's waiting, dad. ...terrific. Maybe you oughtta try putting on some pants. Thank you. Have a good day. May I help you? Two. Oh. That's $4.45 with tax. Don't bother wrapping them. You know, Rose, it warms the heart to see kids taking precautions. ...that's, uh, better. Susie... Well, if I am... You do? ...come... didn't get...? I don't know. Well, you gotta come by. At least to the locker room and say hello. OK. Wanna come next week? I mean, can you blame a guy for seeking a out a more mature relationship. Honest, I really like you, Susie. You're gonna make me puke. ...I just met you five minutes ago and you're all over me like an octopus. Susan? What? I wanna talk to you. Not now. Come on. Laura! I wanna tell you something in the kitchen. ...would you get off? God, you jocks are all the same, groping sex maniacs. Laura, what do you want? I don't know what to do. Word came directly from Ron, I swear. Ron? Ron is the biggest BS artist in school. Do you like him? I guess so. I mean, do you like him? Yeah. OK. Well, do you wanna do it? All right. What do you want from me? Blind dates, it's always a shot in the dark. You know that. Pat, I thought we were passed this stage. Ron, he set us up. What are you complaining about? Look who's making the sacrifices. Shh. I gave up the beauty of the beast, didn't I? What beauty? If you're so unhappy, let's trade. No way. Where'd you put them? What? You know. Under the pillow. What? Under the pillow. Mom, some friends just came in for a quickie visit. Come on. Outta here, you rotten kids! Now get out of here. - You have no right to be... - hi there. Come on, come on. It's time to go. Out of here, you rotten kids! At last, an improvement. But don't let it go to your heads. You're still quite a ways from performing with the Vienna Philharmonica. And I would like you kids to continue working from letter D. And now scram. Hi, John. Oh hi, Corri. I, uh, heard about your big score Saturday night. Oh, well you know how it is. Yeah, that's not what Suzie said. Oh, by the way, you forgot these balloons under the pillow. See you later. Hi, sis. Hi, pat. Pat, look what your sister just laid on me. I knew she was growing faster, but not this fast. Come on. Coach Rizzo will really cheer us up. Johnny, come here. Pat, excuse us, eh? Don't be late for practice. Yes, grandpa? Johnny, you missed a couple of rehearsals because of football practice. And while I tried to understand as your grandfather, as your teacher, I find it unacceptable. Grandpa. You're talented, gifted. Don't waste it on barbarism. Grandpa, give me a break, will you? I've spoken to Mr. Hoit of the Youth Symphony. Now, he said he would accept you because of my recommendation. Now how many boys get an opportunity like that? You've got to get serious. Forget football. You need more rehearsals. Grandpa, I just turned 17. And all that's really important to me right now is what I'm doing on Saturday night. You know what I mean? Oh, yes. But if you're old enough to mate, you're old enough to make up your own mind about your life. You were my age. All the brothers in Naples had to keep iron locks on their doors. Well, my boy, I guess there's just no way of getting through to you, is there? Coming? How about that, huh? - Come on, man. - We're late. We gotta get out of here. We gotta get... Rizzo's gonna kill us. I will see you out there. Wait, Pat. I have something to show you. What? Come here. Ouch! Boy, isn't he a handsome guy? That's pretty funny. Come here. 25 laps. How many miles is that? Six or seven. Oh. No more hot idea. No more... Let's get something to drink. Yeah. - How was the olympic? - Huh? What's up, coach? This way. Sure, coach. I want to to know. What is it? You're disqualified. I'm, I'm what? You're disqualified. I had nothing to do with it, honest to god. It's the new district medical examiner, Dr. Bowers. Dr. Bowers? He says you can't play with a hearing handicap. Handicap? He's never even examined me. It's in the records, John. I'm sorry. What is this? A union meeting or something? Come on, break it up. Is that all then? I gotta stick by the rules. I'm sorry. Without John, we're not a championship team. That's what we got. You got the word. John's disqualified. I've been shooting my mouth off with the doctor for over an hour. And all he comes up with is the same answer, no. N-O. Are you the coach or not? As far as the doc's concerned, coaches are canned jellyfish. Did I tell you they gave me a new secretary? No. Oh, yeah. A beauty. Well, she must be because obviously she can't type. You know what? What? I forgot to ask. No monkey business. Mm. Oh, You know it's 11:30 and John's not home yet. Well, he's a growing boy. You're gonna have to get used to it. Not on week days. Huh, come on. Let him have a little fun. John, are you all right? Yeah, just fabulous. Why didn't you call me? I didn't get a chance to. What the hell was all that? I don't know. John? That was quite an entrance down there. Don't like you talking that way to your mother... Come on, John. You wanna tell me or not? I'd love to you about it, dad. I can't play on the team any more. I'm disqualified. What are you talking about? Something about my handicap. But you never said I was handicapped. They're telling me I'm handicap.. Now wait a minute. Somebody's flipped their rocker here. You're perfectly normal. Well, not according to Dr. Bowers I'm not. Bowers? He's, he's a has been. Thee guy that replaced Dr. Silver after he suffered from a stroke. Dad, if they don't let me play, I'm quitting school. Hold it, hold it now. Playing football is important, but your education's still number one. We always agreed on that. I wanna bust the place up! All right. Now we'll fight him, but we'll do it through the proper channels and without losing our head. Am I handicapped? Huh? Answer me, am I handicapped? Am I? No. Huh? Come on now, I said no. Come on John. I'm gonna back you up. Huh? I'm gonna back you up. Can I handle that? All right then, come on. It's all right. I love you, dad. By a majority vote of five to one, the board has approved funds converting all hand towel dispensers in the toilet areas to electric drying machines. And now to the next order of business. Uh, Mr. Carluccio, uh, I have your letter here requesting a consideration of your son's case. ...you have the floor... Thank you, Mr. Henderson. Um, I'm here seeking to overturn a decision passed by Dr. Bowers prohibiting my son from playing football. The directive is arbitrary and discriminatory. Discrimination is a very strong accusation. I'll prove it to you. All right. How? By demonstrating that my son can hear normally with his hearing aid on. John, would you step up here. Now Mr. Carluccio, um, would you have your son remove his hearing aid? Why? I've just proved he can hear me even when my back is turned. Well, you did. But can he hear you without his hearing aid? Excuse me. Um, Mr. Henderson, but would you be able to read without your glasses, sir? All right. I remove my glasses. I can still see, but can you hear without your hearing aid? Mr. Henderson, may I say something, please? Go ahead, Coach Rizzo. Well, uh, I just want to say that John Carluccio is about the best player I've ever coached. Why, I'd play him if he were cock-eyed and horse-tailed. Thank you. Can we proceed now? The board should immediately reverse Dr. Bowers decision. Now just a moment. There are six members on this board and we are trying objectively and democratically to examine both sides of the question. I don't think we can take a vote until we've consulted with Dr. Bowers, the legally appointed medical examiner of this district. I will submit a written report to the board. There. We'll convene again in two weeks. Meeting adjourned. ...stop horsing around and get out in the field! Hey guys, I think that is the first time I have ever seen Lance in the shower. I hope it shrunk his head though. Hey, John. Can I help, coach? Yeah, sure, John. How does that feel? Feels real good, coach. Thanks. Oh, let's see. How'd you like to take out the ball bag, huh? Sure. OK, come on. Everybody finish dressing outside. Come on... Let's go. Move it. Come on, outside, everybody. ...take it easy, man. Dr. Bowers? Your father is very insistent that I speak with you. So, uh, pull up a chair. That'll do. Just there. Thank you. Can you hear me? Yes, sir. What did I say precisely? Can you hear me. Well, according to your records you lost the hearing in one ear and 50 percent in the other at the age of eight. Yeah, that's right. A swimming accident. And you've played football since the age of seven. Um, Dr. Bowers does it say anything in your records about the fact that I've played violin since the age of three? Oh, yes, yes. Extraordinary. Now, remove your hearing aid, please. I don't see the point. I must have your cooperation. Count from one to ten. Count from one to ten, please. What? Oh, that's all right, son. I've been asking you to count from one to ten. It, it's all right. Remove the hearing aid, please. Why are you doing this to me? Please understand me. My only and primary interest is the preservation of whatever little hearing you may have left. It's only a minor disability. You don't read lips. Can you do sing language? Hell no. Why, should I? Well, I wish it were only a minor disability, but I'm afraid it's much more than that. The way I see it, you endanger not only yourself by playing, but also your teammates. We haven't had an injury in two years. And I have proven my abilities. At best I say you've been lucky to get away with it as long as you have. You're turning me into some kind of freak. That's preposterous. I'm acting in accordance of my best judgement. What'd he say? Nothing. There's nothing wrong with you, man. Yeah, they oughtta bring doc Silver back. I don't know. Maybe that doctor's got a point, you know? That's rotten coming from you, Lance. You've got asthma. What makes you so different from me, huh? What makes you different from me? Come on, man. I'm sorry. No, no, no. Drop it, please, like this. Dah, dah, dah. Pick up to three. Trumpets only, huh? All right now. One, two, three, four. Wait, no, no, no, no, no. You see, it all begins with scales. You must practice your scales every day. They are your voices. The maestro Pablo Casals said, scales were his teachers. They liberated him. Trumpets, again. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One... John? John! Lisa, take over. John? Don't jeopardize the good things you have going for yourself. Like what? Dah, dah, dah? Yes, absolutely, dah, dah, dah. Take what's happening as an opportunity to concentrate on what is really important. Get off your high horse, will you grandpa? You know what's important? What's important is that I don't feel like playing today. That's what's important. And it's my own decision. My own damn decision. So go dah dah yourself. It had better be worth it. I don't find this one bit amusing. It's not meant to be. All right, come on. Let's circle up, let's go. Doctor. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Let's go, come on. All right. All right, ready, let's go. 17... 17. Come on! I can't. Why not? I don't wanna hurt the guy. - You know. - Come on. Come on. This is John's chance to prove himself. Come on. I said break it up! Shut up! Shut up...! I'm surprised at you. I stick out and this is the way you repay me, huh? He asked for it! I don't care who asked for it! You know my rules! No fighting! Well, I'm sorry. That's not good enough! Now go on, take you uniform off. You're through. Go on. Beat it. Get out of here. Get out. And you, you creep. You're suspended. What about tomorrow's game, coach? I said you're suspended till tomorrow. Now shut up! Hey, Pops. Hi, Johnny. Hey, You're a little early, ain't you? I didn't have any practice today. Is there like a soda or something. Oh, yeah. Chris is here, huh? Yeah, he's here. Wish to heck he wasn't. He's as welcome as a skunk at a church social. Now don't you go getting into no trouble, you hear? I won't. See you. It's nice. Think I'm gonna call it, "Heart Sick. Teenage Bourbon Alcohol Blues." Well, I'm always open to suggestions. OK, well, take it from the hook. OK. ...country love. Country love. Country love. Nice compromise. It's a deal. It's a song. Well, why don't you, um, why don't you come on Saturday and bring your axe and...? Well, I had a blast last session, so I'd love to. OK. See you. OK, Saturday. All right. Election time... All right, bro. One for you. Hey, John. Hi, how you doing? Good. You haven't lost your touch. I keep in practice, you know. I got a couple of, uh, buddies I want you to meet. You've got, uh, Herman here and Jess. Hey, hey, what's you say? How you going? Come on over to our table and meet a couple of foxy ladies. US bred and prime beef. Here we got, we got Samantha and Linda. This is John Tiger Carluccio, Mr. Grid Iron itself. Pops... Hey, how's your dad? He's doing pretty well. He just got promoted to district sales manager at Metro Life. Metro Life? Yeah. That's kinda like my old man. He got promoted from... to Sing Sing. I hear you ain't on a team anymore. Yeah, some quack doctor barred from all contact sports. Want my boys to squeeze his nose a little? Na. John? You don't any coach on your back to worry about now. Welcome to the adult world. Hello? Yes? What? No, we weren't aware that he was absent from school. Um, expulsion? Mr. Martin, he's been going through an awful lot lately. Yes. Of course we'll do what's necessary. OK. John? Give me a beer. I don't believe it. Ah. I think the boys might want a beer. Go on, give them one. How about two? Why not? Hey boys, how about a little Gatorade, huh? Vitamin C enriched. Cheers. You trying to get kicked out of school or what? Come on, who cares, huh? Where's your P-R-I-D-E? What is this? A spelling bee? No. It means pride. I don't see anybody asking your opinion. All right. Coach Rizzo sees this, you'll never get on the team again. Never. Let's see if you can spell this out. You tell coach Rizzo to take it and... What's with you? Split. No way. I don't blame you for feeling bitter. Hey, look it. There's a lot of things you can do to fight back. But hanging out with...? That sure isn't the way. Are you gonna start preaching? Look it, you do whatever you want. Just let me say this first. A skunk don't stink all the time, but if you don't watch out, it'll spray you. Why don't you lay off Christ? It'll spray you? Jeez. If you don't watch out, it'll spray you. I don't know.. Why don't you share some of the stuff you've been smoking? If you don't watch out it'll spray you. Hey listen, forget those creeps, man. I mean, you're still one of us. Nothing's changed. It's all in your mind. The guys need you. You mean that? Yeah, sure. Who's more psyched up than you, anyway? Come on. Let's go down... Sure. Dynamite chick. Oh. That's just dying to meet you. What? Another one of your hack blind dates? No thanks. Ah, yeah. Let's go... Ah, looking good, right! Right! Get them up, get them up, get them up! Hey coach, why don't you let me gear up and get in there are run a couple of plays just to keep my timing sharp, huh? I can't. Where you going? I busted my chin strap. Well, hurry it up. All right, all right. Let's go. Huddle up, huddle up. Quiet. All right, quiet down though. That was good. That was very good. How's it going, John? Hey, hey, hey, all right. That's good, that's good... All right! OK, come on. Come on. Let's huddle up, huddle up. Come on. All right, let's go, lads. Let's go. Lousy, Bob. How about yourself? We miss your play, man. That's good. That's good! Hey, I'll be seeing you around, John, huh? All right, let's go, let's go, let's go! ...first down, you know they play. Let's go. Let's go, let's go. Come on, make it look good now. Make any money today, Pop? - Eh, broke even. - Eh, boy. You need a lift? Ah, no, not tonight. I think I'm gonna bike it home. Take it easy. All right. Uh, Johnny, come here. Now look, kid, Just a word of advice. Life is funny. Sometimes you're the bug and sometimes you're the windshield. Sometimes I'm the what? You know what I mean. I know you've had it rough, but this ain't the answer. Now you've got a real good future if you'll just stick to your music and your school books. This ain't for you. You just give some darn serious thoughts to what I've said to you. Can I come in? Yeah, sure. I'm finished anyway. You know, one day they'll stand in line to see you. Sure, selling hamburgers at McDonald's. Hey, come here. Listen, I know things seem a little dim right now. Like my old coach always used to say, every adversity, every headache, carries with it the seed of an equivalent or greater benefit. Words suck, dad. Listen, John. Um, did you ever think perhaps, there might be some truth in what the doctors say? First the doctor, then coach, now you. Come on, take it easy. I'm just questioning it. What the hell is there to question? Risk of injury. Injury? Injury. You know, that's I've been hearing lately, injury. You really just don't understand, do you? Well, you think I don't know? I was headed for college sophomore of the years honors. Just because you got hurt doesn't mean I'm gonna get hurt. Right. All right. But do you think that's going to you where you're headed? Big deal. So I smoke a little. The point is, John, you're breaking the rules! Now if you want to win, you do with some discipline and now falling. Come on, hit me again, big shot. What difference does it make? How about a hand for the man who helped me write this song, John Carluccio. ...outlaws. We'll be back in a few minutes. Hi. I didn't know you could play the country... ...with Jimmy O. Now. Did I see you come in here with Chris? Yeah, it's no big deal. Besides, I thought he was your friend. He is. But I've known him since kindergarten. Well, I'm here with Sam. Sam? Samantha. The blonde. Oh. She's my cousin. Anyway, she asked me to tag along. Who are you here with? An old friend. You're loosing your touch, John. You're not kidding. Lately I'm batting a big fat zero. I know someone that can end that batting slump. You're serious, aren't you? Mhmm. I mean, you're like a little kid sister to me. Maybe not that little any more, but... besides, your brother Pat would murder me if I ever laid a hand on you. Who said I'd let you? Do you wanna dance? Hi, guys. What's going on? Hey, John. John, we got a little surprise... Why don't you try a little? No, Chris. Come on, it'll make you feel good. Come on. Go. Yeah. Huh? Come on, two toots are better than one. John. Hurry up. John. You got it on your nose. Wipe your nose. John, please take me home. Come on, pretty mama. Fun's just beginning. Hey, cousin Corri, Chris says he has a surprise. Come on. Chris is right. ...OK? What is going on here? Chris... what is this? Another car? ...get in. We go... come on! Hello, Cadillac. I've had my eyes on you for a long time. Wow, a limousine. You know what to do? Yeah. Give me 30. 30? You got it. One, two, three... Five six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 16, 21, 22, 23, He did it. ...come on! I can't believe... Shh, shh. Oh, John, I don't wanna go. I can't believe... Come on, man. You chicken? I don't wanna go. Yee haw! Please let me out! Chris, stop the car. Let me out! Sure, go ahead. Chris, stop the car. Let go! I'm trying to drive, jerk! Watch it! Now where the hell have you been? Morning. Juice? No, mom. Dad? Dad? Nobody's perfect. I'm learning that. It won't happen again. John, we trust you. Don't hang us up. All right? All right. No more questions. I'll get your breakfast. Thanks, mom. Here, read the comics. John, Corri wants to talk to you. Corri? Wow. The police got Herman. That's too bad. You can thank Chris for that. Chris blames you. He told Sam that he lost control of the limo because you bugged him. That guy is definitely a psycho. I don't want anything to do with him any more. So pretty here. Yeah, sometimes I come down here and I play my violin. There's something very magical about nature and music. You love your music, don't you? Yeah. I can remember my grandfather putting a violin in my hands when I was three. He'd like to think I'd become another... You never know if you really studied. Well, I don't know. Now, my dad, he was supposed to become another... But he wrote poetry and played football until he hurt his knees. Did he ever publish any of his poems? Na. I think he sent some out once. But they got rejected. He lost heart and that's when he got into selling insurance. I'll bet your grandfather went wild. Poor dad. Some day, when I become a somebody, I'm gonna publish his poetry. Without even reading it. You know, you're a hard one to figure out. I mean, you play violin. You're willing to go out on the football field and roll in the mud with a bunch of animals. Bash your head in. It's, it's a contradiction. Weird. You're a menace to my ego. Be serious, John. Are you playing football to prove something? I mean, is it because of your dad or, or is it your hearing problem? What are you trying to prove? You some kind of shrink or something? Someday I will be. Oh, no. A weirdo. Forget about practicing with me, Corri. John? John! John? John? I roll in the mud! In the past, when I used to look at you, Go on. Don't stop. A light used to kind of go off in my brain, you know? Incest, incest. Only yesterday, you were... Skinny little sister. I remember you as the fattest kid on the block. I'm not trying to prove anything. The only thing I really can't do is hear in stereo. Why don't you try stacking up the speakers? The next item on this evening's agenda will be the decision on the John Carluccio matter. May I have the Dr. Bowers file? Thank you. Dr. Bowers' report was read to members of the board and by a vote of four to two, they decided to uphold the doctor's decision. Now we will. The board can have my resignation effective immediately. Mr...? You mean that's it? There's no more discussion? Mr. Carluccio, the matter has been resolved. What do you mean it's been resolved? - What's the word? - Pride! What's the word? Pride! What's the word? Pride! We want John! We want John! I would like to know the meaning of this intrusion. John Carluccio won this for the best Little League catcher five years ago, batting 424. Very impressive. And this for... Valley's most valuable football player, John Carluccio. How many more do you have? I am truly sorry, but... Oh, don't apologize. I just want you all to know that I think this is a gutless decision. Mr. Carluccio, we have a very long agenda. Mr. Henderson? Yes, John? Ever since I've been taken off the team, there's been a lot of talk, feelings. From my dad, my mom, my friends, school board, it's like whether I play or not is a big deal. And people are asking why, why do I wanna play, what am I trying to prove. I'd like to play football, just like I like to play the violin. One really isn't more important than the other one. Now a doctor says that I can't play football. And it seems pretty simple to me. Why, I don't like being told I can't do something I know that I'm capable of doing. I don't want be told that. And I'm not going to accept being told that. Well said, John! My hands are tied. That's it. One more now. Now let me have your attention. Let me have your attention. By this time tomorrow, we'll be in the playoffs, which should put us in the championship game. Now we've beat these guys before on our field and we can do it again. Now, I want you guys to concentrate and execute. But you're gonna have to want it bad enough. Do you want it bad enough? Yeah! Do you want it bad enough? Yeah! I'm proud of you guys. Don't disappoint me. We've come this far. Disappoint me, I'm gonna cut your ears off and hang them on my belt! And get to bed early! No partying, OK, let's go! John? Go, go, go, go, go! Get him! Pick him up! ...huh? Get him up. Get him up! John? Chris. Hey Jess, where's Herman? He's on a forced vacation. Why? Because of him. Can you hear that? Chris. You. And you? How about you? Are you OK now? You were very troubled when you came to see me last week. Yes, especially since we started classes. Good. Because when learn sign language, and especially lip reading, then you don't have to be afraid of not communicating with anyone. That's what scared me... When Chris took my aid, I was, I was, I don't know. It made me realize that dad's not always going to be around with a spare one. Would it be reassuring to know that sign language isn't hard to learn? You know, I feel like I'm, I'm a person finding his roots. Beginning to know what I'm all about. Let's go... Let's start. OK, come on! OK, who wants first honor? I do. Come on, man. Let's go! Man, you're too small. What are you talking about? Hey, you guys think you're tough? Come on, fair fight! I'll take all you apes on one by one. Just like you did with Carluccio, right? Come on, man! He's all right. From here on out, I'm gonna call you... We're approaching the end of first half of this championship game. High will kick off down by touchdown. And the ball goes to number 33. Oscar... He's gotta wedge up the middle. ...he's out the opening, going down the field... touchdown! High now trails by two touchdowns. They seem to have run out of miracles. They sorely miss the player, their star running back, John Carluccio, disqualified. Earlier this season because of a hearing handicap. High is desperately in need of a scoring drive. Here comes the kickoff. ...first and ten on their own 27 yard line. Quarterback... had the ball. He's fading back to pass. Oh! Oh, boy did he get hit. He was sacked for a loss. Right now it looks pretty dismal for... high fans. There's the snap. It's headed off to number 31, Lance... He's tackled for no gain. There's... It's a pitch out to Lance... ...running around... Pounded to the turf! Oh, he's not getting up. It looks like he may be injured. Time out on the field. If... is injured, ...chances for victory would seem to be slipping further away. ...do I have your permission to put John in the game? What? I want your permission to let him play. You got it. Hurry up and suit up! Get your ugly face in that game! You know you're committing suicide. Can you think of a better way to go? Rizzo! Hey, what do you want from me? I got a game to win! After the punt... High has the ball first down on their 29 yard line. Now. Wait a minute, folks. This is incredible! John Carluccio, number 45, is I uniform and he's coming into the game!
