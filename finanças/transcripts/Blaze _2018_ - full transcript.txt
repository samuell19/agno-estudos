Ladies and gentleman, it's an honor to have with us today, Townes Van Zandt. - Thank you. - Ah, great to have you here. - Good to be here. Any time. - Um, New record, "No Deeper Blue." - That's right. - Terrific record! Love it. - Thank you. - Love the last song, "Blaze's Blues." - Yep. - I don't know. It says it's dedicated to Blaze Folley. I don't know who Blaze Folley is? It's actually, it's... it's Blaze Foley. Uh, it's a blues song. You should.. You really should know, who Blaze was. - "Clay Pigeons?" - Yeah. Ah, "If I Could Only Fly?" Willie and Merle covered. - Yeah. - "Our Little Town"? You can't.. See you can't do.. You can't do this, um, show. Any kind of show without a blues song. Wait. A... are those Blaze's songs? - You know "Achy Brakey Heart"? - Yes! - Yeah. No, he didn't write that. - Yeah, he didn't write that. See, Blaze was a, he was a buddy of ours, a real buddy. You know, obviously a fellow songwriter. And only went crazy once, Blaze. Just once. But he stayed there. [LAUGHS] He was shot and killed. Oh. Some, some punk kid in Austin. I think he lives out west now. Well, the kid was trying to steal his dad's disability check and, uh, Blaze decided he he wasn't gonna let that happen. He tried to, he tried to do something about it and then he took a bullet in the gut for it. I'm so sorry. "There are a great many things a man cannot understand. "Any girl would rather love an unfortunate man than a fortunate one "because every girl.. "...would like to do something by loving. "A man has his work, so for him love "is always kept in the background. "To talk to his wife "and walk with her in the garden "and to pass the time... pleasantly with her "that is all that love means to a man. "But... but for us.. "...love.. "...means life. "I love you. "That means that I dream only "of how I can cure you "of your sadness. "If... if you are in heaven, then I am in heaven "if you are in the pit, then I am in the pit. "If you are in the pit.. If you are in the pit then I am in the pit. "For instance it would be, for instance, it would be the greatest happiness for me "to stay up all night writing for you "to stay up all night writing for you or to watch.. "Or to watch all night.. "...that no one should wake you. "I remember that three years ago at threshing time.." Ah.. Excuse me? Sorry, hi. Uh, would you mind stopping the work just for like two more minutes until I get through this speech? Thank you so much. "When I, when I brought you a glass of water.. "...you were already lying on the sofa "and sleeping like a dead man. "You slept there for half a day, and all that time "I watched by the door to make sure "that no one should disturb you. "The more a girl can do, the greater her love can be. I mean, that is, the more she feels it." Okay, I'm done. Thank you. I think I was better when you were working. I got nervous when you stopped. More, more nervous. Well, I'll never stop. Alright, listen, I think we should start with "Big Cheeseburgers And Good French Fries" - "Let Me Ride In Your Big Cadillac." - No, no, no, no. And we're doing a ton of songs in A. I think we should make sure to revert every... every third to C or E. Oh, shut up, Zee. He's just gonna shake 'em and he's gonna roll. - And my friend had to leave town for.. For 18 years. - Fuck Townes. I hooked Blaze up with this guy Phil. He's costin' a shit ton of money and we only get two hours tape. We can't have him gettin' drunk and reading off the back of tampon packages. As funny as that is. His brother owned the rights to all the.. No, but I mean seriously, if I ran us off the road right now and this exploded, none of these songs would even fucking exist. Just drop me off at Will's. "Drop me off at Will's." Where the fuck you going? ...is only giving Blaze the gig because of you. It's like rain. Rain doesn't try and fall. It just falls, because it's rain. Okay? So, it's the same with acting. - Leave me alone! - You don't try and act... I don't need your help! - Ah. - He's got a gun! - What? - He's got a gun! He's got a gun! Run! He's got a gun! Fuck me! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] He's got a gun, scatter! Scatter! Who has a gun? You know that skinny guy that does the lights? - Doug? - Yeah. He's got a uh.. ...14-year-old hayseed girl up in his room. So me and some of the guys went up there because that didn't sound very good. Trying to make sure everything's on the up and up. Turns out the fucking guy is nuts. I guess I should've known. You know what they say. No, what do they say? Never stand in the way of true love. I'm Sybil by the way. I'm Deputy Dawg. No, you're not. Deputy Dawg? You like Blaze better? What's your real name? It was Mike Fuller, but, uh I ditched that when I lost 150 pounds. You lost 150 pounds? You wanna see my stretch marks? Is that your best line? Ah! Nope. My best line, "Picture cards can't picture you." How'd you lose all that weight? Thorazine. Where'd you get that, uh, that limp from? I had polio. Oh, no. I'm sorry. It's okay. I was only eight months old. I've been an oddball ever since. I never could run or dance or play any of the reindeer games. In high school.. ...I was the only Jewish person so they used to invite me into classes for show and tell. [CHUCKLES] Well.. ...odd ducks unite! I'm shy. I don't know why. All wild things are shy. ♪ River's overflowin' ♪ Down here where I am ♪ The rain keeps on pouring ♪ I can't get in to town ♪ I guess I may start walking ♪ For the mornin'.. ♪♪ At his funeral, we, uh we duct taped his casket together. - Yeah, we sure did. Didn't we? - Yeah. Well, he was buried with everything he owned. Which didn't really add up to nothing. - No. A Reagan mask, some pigs! - But, do you know what? He, uh.. This was his guitar. Right here. He gave it to you? I bought it for him. I bought it for him. - You did? - Yeah. You see, Blaze he... he, uh.. ...he was really popular at the pawn shop. Almost famous at the pawn shop. He, he ended up borrowing more guitars than he ever actually played. After the funeral I heard that it might be at this one shop - The guitar? - This guitar. So I went over there and sure enough, there it was. And, uh.. But, you know.. I told the guy, I said, "Hey, man, that's... that's my buddy's guitar." And you know he gave it to me. He actually willed it to me. Which he did! But he wasn't giving away nothing. He wanted 1800 bucks for it. So we all knew that Blaze only had one coat and I was pretty sure that that pawn slip was gonna be in that coat. So, one night after the funeral we got thinking about it and, uh drinking about it maybe a little bit and me and Al Minus and, uh.. Crazy Kerkin you know, some, I'm not really sure. When was this? You weren't there, but.. I just pretty much decided I was gonna go over there and I was gonna dig him up to get, to get that pawn slip. And that's what I did. I went over there and I dug him up cut through that duct tape opened it up and sure enough, there it was. Right there in that breast pocket. [SNIFFS] His pawn slip. I'll tell you something else about that. When I got it open he was grinnin'. Like laughin'. So now it's my guitar. [LAUGHS] Only one drink, big dog. That's the limit. I don't want any shenanigans from you tonight. No fights. No belligerent bullshit. - No, no, he's... - You got it? It's none for him. He's sober. Give his to Concho. Damn right! - Blaze sober? Bullshit. - Yeah. He's clean as a the house too. - Where's Townes? - Oh, he's, uh, he had to make a stop. - He's right behind us. He's coming. - Uh-huh. I'm breaking so many promise to myself letting you play again. Don't make me regret it. Fuck! What an asshole. - Hmm. - You good? Sneak me a Dr. Pepper and a squirt of amber in it. Nah. You got this. You got this. Check, check, check. Alligator, alligator, alligator, gah. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] You rollin'? Okay, good people. I've got every last dollar in the world to me spinnin' 'round those reel to reels so you know. So I'm gonna do my best not to do too much Johnny Carsonin' or Chatty Cathyin' just gonna play every song I, I can think of I guess. Will that mean we're gonna be on the album if I shout a ton? Yes, I suppose it does! [LAUGHS] Hey, Jake, we're gonna be on the album! Welcome home! Fuck you! Hey! When's Townes comin'? He's comin' when he's coming. Spring bird. You know spring bird! Springers! You've got to know some springers. Ever feel like you're not gonna be alive much longer? Ha! With the way you live, that's not much of a premonition. That's wishful thinkin'. Well.. ...if I was to go up and see the Big Spender That's what I call the man upstairs, The Big Spender. 'Cause he, or she, is one generous being. You want a light? Zap! Here's a star on fire. You like flowers? Here's ten million different kinds. You want music? Here's Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart! You don't dig on the fancy pants symphonic stuff? Here's Merle Haggard. Yeah, I suppose if I was to check out early and go and meet the Big Spender I'd be sad I never got to meet Merle Haggard never got to play my charm song. So, ladies and gentleman's this deal tonight, is my letter to Merle. Say hi to Merle, folks. - Hey, Merle! - Howdy, Merle! - Hey, Merle. - Hey, Merle. You know, I bet old Merle's been in love. Well, I's been in love too. This one's called "Picture Cards Can't Picture You." Ain't that right? You see it's not that primitive. It's got, you know.. ...running water.

Huh? I don't wanna be a star. I wants to be a legend. [LAUGHS] What's the, what's the difference, deputy? Well.. ...stars burn out 'cause they shine for themselves. Look at me shine, look at me glow. I'm amazing. Legend lasts forever. A legend stands for something. Something that matters, you know? Well, do you think that's possible? You... you could live forever? People can't, but a song can. It's just a matter of time. [HOWLING] All of a sudden I have no idea what to sing. You know any Neil Young? When is Townes comin'? Why don't you play the first song you ever wrote? The first song I ever wrote? Man, I wouldn't play that song to myself sitting in the dark. Stupid little song about living in a tree house in the woods. I wrote that song for a.. ...a beautiful little Jewish gal with kinky hair. Thought that song would last forever. Just like every time, I'm... preparing a scene it's like... I have all these ideas of how I wanna do it and then.. ...when I actually have to do it or if there's somebody watching me.. ...it's not even like stage fright, it's just like.. ...the ease of it kinda leaves my body. You know? - And.. - Mm. After every time, it's like it's never as good as I know it can be. I don't know, I guess it's just, like, confidence or something I just don't feel like I'm giving it all the energy I actually have. I wanted to be, like, free and not questioning what I'm doing but I'm always questioning it. Where do you think confidence comes from? I don't know. Thinking you're the best? That's not real confidence. Can I tell you where I think it comes from? Mm-hm, okay. I think confidence is a consolation prize for knowing that you're alive. I do. Some years back, you weren't even here. And now you're here. - Mm. - Couple years, you won't be here again. Knowin' that you're here's... kind of a rarity as a human being. It seems too simple but it's true I think. Next time you're on stage remember, you got a heart beatin' in your chest.. ...there's lungs filling up with air. All that stuff is really happenin'. All these little melodramas people make up for themself they don't mean anything. I think that's the way it is. You have it though. I've seen it. Yeah, as long as you're around. That's not true. You have it when you're walking across the room. And you fill other people with it because you remind them that they're alive. Bet you didn't know that? No, I didn't. Well, now you do. Now, please discard. I'm ready, there! Can I take another one? - No! - Okay. It's my turn! That night, the night he died, uh.. ...we recorded a live record.. ...at, uh.. It was The Outhouse. Is Townes coming or not? Maintain Jennifer, he's comin'. Yo! I often find myself thinking on where does a song come from? A real song. You know what I mean? He's told me not to come here. 'Cause the good ones, they just sort of arrive on time. There we go. Like, uh... where was it? ♪ I'm so lonesome I could cry ♪♪♪ Five minutes before it was written. Where was it? 'Cause it's, once it's in the air it's like it's always been there. You can't imagine the world without that melody. It's like babies maybe. Where do they come from? Comes from love, right? From the galaxy deep. All them stars, lighting up the night sky. Songs are like stars or like babies. What happens if you stop 'em? What happened to all the songs in me that haven't come out yet on account of me not being able to live up to who I'm supposed to be. Maybe I should just be satisfied with all the burnin' planets we got. The whole universe can't catch on fire, can it? Maybe it can. Maybe the Milky Way's a gigantic record and your life is like the needle. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] Where the hell you going? Take a smoke break. What the fuck? Hell no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

See, it was just like his songs there was two kinds of Blaze. Some folks met one some folks met the other one. And one of 'em was just plain wild. Lots of folks knew that one. But now the other one, that one was different. He was big, he was kind and gentle. But sometimes he could get bitter. I keep thinkin' about people 20 years from now.. Jim wants me to deliver that shit today. Shit. I imagine they'd be lookin' at him. Asshole. What? Well.. Listen, honey, just.. Just go and order the pizzas. Well, tell him to go fuck himself. Pizza's fine. But then again.. What is he, Little Lord Fauntleroy? Maybe he's just thinkin' who the hell is this fool talking on the phone for the whole thing? You know, you'd never know by lookin' at him. But he was a spiritual, almost righteous. I guess you could say he took a vow of poverty and saw everything through that lens. You know, I used to fish the White River with my father. I don't know when I'm gonna be back. I just.. One spring I was fishin' with him and I said, "Daddy, is this the same water we was ridin' on last summer?" I mean, is this water that we're motivatin' on the same water... from before? I told you I was gonna pick some shit up for Jim! I gotta drop it off! He just shook his head looked at me, with some bait on his hook. 'Cause I put 20 bucks in the damn drawer is how you can order it! That's when I realized grown folk don't know shit. I can't sit here and talk all day. I've gotta go. And nobody knows nothin'. Least of all this goofy son of a bitch. Is he talking to me? Heh, probably. Yeah! I'm talking to you! I can hear every goddamn words you're saying on that talk bus. How many quarters do you plan on jamming in, Igmitus? Hey, man, I'm just waiting for your shit music to stop. Ah, ignore this fucker, man. Shit music. Honey, I might have to call you back. - Uh-huh. - Blaze. Oh, no, no, no, no. Why don't you bring your ass up here, ZZ Top? Blaze, come on. Fucking piece of shit. One time we'd been up for like a week.. ...writing. I was finally trying to fall asleep. Blaze just stumbles into the room and he's, like, mumbling something. He, he told me he was trying to meditate. What? Yeah. He, he just kept.. ...saying this, like, Buddhist prayer over and over again he was just like, staring at the wall What, like a mantra? But then all of a sudden there was this.. ...explosion in the room. Like the room exploded with this bright white light and it felt like something, like.. It was like somethin' that hasn't made it its way into a book. And from this feeling of genuine love this Buddha-like character appeared. And he went to the door and he opened the door and there was even a bigger explosion of light and in walks Jesus. And Jesus tells Blaze that you never turn your back on your family. Did he say it that in Aramaic? Yeah, something like that. Regardless of what you worship or how you worship.. ...you can't.. You can't lose, you can't strip away these these symbols that you're raised with. They become part of you like.. ...like blood. Hell fucking no. No, no, no, no, no. Hell fucking no. Here's what I'm saying is Blaze didn't have to look east to see the light. The light is with us. I think the two of you were drinking or something for a week, and if I remember correctly you had to pull a pistol on him to get him out of your bedroom. What I'm saying is that, uh, he was, um.. He was open to that kind of experience. That doesn't mean that I think he could handle it. Goddammit, why'd you take your hands down to the goddamn hole in the wall. Because they won't let you in. I let you in and you come in you asked me to come in and goddammit I let you in and you fuck it up! - I'm real sorry about that. - I'm gonna tear your ass down.. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Look, I care for the man. I care for him. Six... six hundred. Let's just, let us finish this. Now, come on. I'm just sick and fucking tired of people getting hurt in my bar. - Don't you understand? - Oh, come on. - It's over. - Please? Goddammit. Son of a mother fucking bitch. That was embarrassing. You alright? I think so. Okey-dokey, smoky-pokey. This next song is my wedding song. If J.T.'s alright with it and they're still not too mad at me I'd love to have the Outhouse family come up here and play some music with us. Jodie, Nassie and Dave. If y'all feel inclined. Come on up here and play this song. This song's called "Big Cheeseburgers And Good French Fries." It's not like playing up a tree house free as a squirrel. But looky here now, I'm just standing here playing for Merle. That rhyme to. There's a little sucker thing going round and around. [GUITAR MUSIC] - Hey! - Hey! - How you been? - I'm doing good. Well aren't you the cutest fucking thing I've ever seen? You feel confident that they're prepared to have a Bigfoot in their house? - There's nothing to worry about. - Sam! - Sam, come on. They're here! She's here! - Let's go, let's go. [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] Thanks for the tea, uh, Mrs. Rosen. I wish I could still drink coffee. Coffee does wonders for my noodle hub but wreaks havoc down in my spaghetti house. It's just a mess, you know? Blaze, don't you think Sybil has a nice nose? Oh, Ms. Rosen, we Pentecostals don't go in for noses. Having said that, as far as noses go, that's one of the finest noses I knows. So you guys been married for a long time? Oh, we've been married forever. Y'all's got that old-fashioned love. That's what I want for Tsibila. Setsibila? What is Setsibila? Tsi... Tsibila. It means a little onion in Yiddish. Little onion. So youse my little sweet Vidalia Onion? Gonna eat you for breakfast with my hot potato. Are you kidding me? Ugh, Mom! Sorry. Can, uh.. ...can we talk to one another... honestly? Yeah. That would be nice. Sybil.. ...I think you brought this man home to meet your family because... you are in love with him and you are considering marriage and children. Is that right? Yeah. We are a Jewish family. Yes. If we have grandchildren, we would want them to be Jewish. - I got it. - I noticed you haven't asked for Sybil's hand. Is that somethin' you were planning on doing? Yeah. Yeah, it was. Well, now would be a great time for that I think. - Now? - Dad. Jeanette? Could you come on back in here, please? No, no, Dad, Dad. Please. Let's not be ridiculous, okay? If Blaze wants to marry me we have to talk about it first. Of course I respect the past, but.. ...the past has a lot of ugliness to it that I think we're all trying to change in the future. I don't want to spend my life cleaning up some man's socks and I definitely don't want to be handed out as if I am something that's owned. If Blaze wants my hand, he has to ask me. And if I say yes, then, we will ask for your blessing. And if you don't give it to us, we'll do it anyway. But if Blaze does decide to convert to Judaism your mother and I, and we haven't discussed this but I'm certain we agree if he does convert, your mother and I will cover the costs. Of course, we will. That's good to know. That's good to know for sure. Blaze, is your faith important to you? Is my faith important to me? I'm not dead positive I know what you mean.. Your identity as a Christian is that fundamental to your integrity? I got ya. Mr. Rosen, Christianity didn't do much more than kick my ass every day including Sunday. It taught me to sing, but, uh... the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away, so... No, not terribly important. That would be a nay. Well, see, that's very helpful for me to know. Say, I got a question? Was Zero Mostel really Jewish? From "Fiddler On The Roof?" Yeah, yeah. I believe so. In fact, I think he was raised orthodox. Yeah. Hot dog. I love Zero Mostel. 'Tis no shame to be poor!

Thank you, thank you, thank you! You guys could make a living at this. Yep, well, we do. You guys, uh, drink a lot of coffee when you guys on the road like this? Oh, yeah. I guess you have to. Keeps us going. I didn't start drinking coffee until I was a teenager. My father loved coffee almost as much as he liked liquor. One summer, we was painting the side of the house. So he had me down on doing the low bit he was doing the high bit. Anyway, he fell on his face. Broke his jaw in three places. - Is this a true story? - This is a true story. This is a true story. I was probably nine years old. And he was in the hospital for three days and I went to visit him on the second day. He was just... you know anxious and shaking, and his jaw was wired shut. And he was, like, and I said, "How you doing, Daddy?" He said "I'm doing alright, apart from the fact "that I need a drink and a cup of coffee "and they won't let me have liquor inside the hospital. But they said I could have coffee." And I'm waiting to find out how. So the nurse came in. Nurse comes in and says, "Mr. Fuller "I really have to apologize to you the only way we can do this is an enema." [LAUGHING] Oh, no. And he said, "I don't care what you do I just want you to get my coffee." So I said, "Should I leave?" He said, "No." So she came in. She.. And I promise you, it's true.. Turned him on his side. And he says, "Son, hold my hand." I said, "Alright." I held his hand and he looked at me and she said "I'm going to put in the hose now, Mr. Fuller. Take a deep breath. Took a deep breath." "Oh! Shit! You put the thing up where it shouldn't be." She rolled this thing in they had hot coffee up in that IV bag. - Hot coffee? - Hot coffee.. They just gone and pour that thing. And she released the valve on that thing and said, "Take a deep breath." He said, "Oh! Shit! Oh, God almighty." And she said, "What's the matter, Mr. Fuller? Is it too hot?" And he said, "No! It's too sweet!"

What's all this? I wrote you a song. I see that. It's all over our walls. Well, I couldn't find any paper. How the hell am I gonna clean this up, Blaze? I knew you wouldn't like it. It's a garbage song anyway. What the fuck is going on with you? To my way of thinkin' every human being person's life is sorta dedicated to trying to perfectify the universe we's livin' in. We're all kinda born into this world into our own dark little rooms. With these shackles wrapped around our feets. Shackles made up from our parents, grandparents religions, countries, phony ideas. And we got to sit there in the dark and try to redeem and gather up these sparks that are flyin' around all around us. And they are flying around us all the time. No denying that, believe me. I try to gather up these sparks and turn 'em into songs. We can all sit in our own little dark room and gather up these sparks and form them into a perfect key. Voila. It's freedom. Dear little Sybil, guess you're upset 'cause you haven't got a letter from me. I know it's strange, seems like since we got married I've been gone all the time. I'm in Atlanta, about to play to a totally empty house. For tips only. But the folks who work here are a good audience. Both of 'em. Sybil, please don't feel like my leavin' Austin and travelin' around so much means I picked music over you. Every woman who comes on to me I tell her about you first thing. That you are my life, my music. That we're apart right now so we and our children can have a peaceful, loving life someday. Sybil, if I could, I'd sell Hoovers at Kmart, I would. But I'm a salesman of songs right now, darlin'. Remember you make songs in me. I love you like in books. I can't wait till we can afford rings. If you miss me, put this postcard by your libido. And I am goin' by the name of Dr. Blaze Foley. Zee is going by Dr. Whiplash Brubaker and after a song he checks the audience's vital signs. I have so much more confidence now, so much, thanks to you. Sometimes I still feel hopeless 'cause of the waist-deep pessimism that blankets this world. But I try to walk above it 'cause of the feelin' you give me. Hey! Say! Hot dog! ♪ In the factory ♪ Never been so slow Sybil, I want you to think about your art yourself, your heart, mind, and soul. Do it now 'cause time eases by every day. Every song I hear about a man and a woman I think about us and cry. Sometimes outside, sometimes inside. I see your face in windows. I love you more than Coney Island double cheeseburgers. You told me at the airport not to remember you with tears in your eyes. I remember your laugh, and your hair your sharing, passion, your fashion your warm smile, your sweet lips but I do remember the tears as well. I know someday you will want a proper home and children and I want to be the father of those children. And I want for them to be well provided for and loved. We can do so many good things for good friends and for this good world but we need some cash. So let's go for it. And if I ever I do find another woman in my arms it would only be in my arms and not in my heart. And should you ever find yourself in the same situation just don't forget me. ♪ He's the president..

Drivin' up, I was thinking about Mississippi River and Muddy Waters and where he came from and all the different blues' artists that had come from Chicago and all the blues that dropped into the Mississippi River and never made it into anybody's ears.

We've been wanting to do this for a long while and it's a real good experience. I couldn't help but think through the whole recording process about the old fable about the songbird for whom which sang the swamp choir. Are you familiar with that? There's this beautiful songbird for whom sang in this swamp choir. He used to rehearse on this little cypress tree and he was up there rehearsin' one day. They had a big swamp recital coming up. He sang a really pretty song and this bullfrog comes up and starts watching him singing. Songbird looked down and said, "Bullfrog, you liked that song I'm singing?" The bullfrog looked up and said, "Ahhh." Songbird said, "Well if you don't like that song I'll sing you an even better song." So he sang another song and yes indeed this song was twice as good as the first one. He finished up the song, he looked down at the bullfrog and he said, "Bullfrog, what you think about that song?" Once again the bullfrog looked up and he said, "Ahhhh." [IMITATES FROG CROAKING] Songbird said, "Damn! I was singing my best song." He took a deep breath and he sang one of the most beautiful songs the frog had ever heard. In fact, it was the most beautiful song the whole swamp had ever heard. It went on and on and at the end of it this high note was held. The songbird stretched his neck, his gullet up to the sky. And he hit that final crescendo and.. Heart gave up. Songbird fell dead. And as he fell that bullfrog looked up and said, 'Ahhh.' And swallowed the songbird. The bullfrog felt pretty bad about that, he wandered over to the river. And he went to see the band leader, which was a big old fat raccoon. He said, "Hey, man, I'd like to sing 'The Revival Of The Night' if that's possible?" The raccoon looked him up and down and said, "Bullfrog.. ...can you even sing?" The bullfrog said, "Nope, but I gots it in me!" [LAUGHING] Well, that's the strangest damn joke I ever heard. Gotta say, Blaze, we're pumped, man. - Hell, yeah! - Whoo! Looking good, looking forward to the gig in New York. The first time that I ever met Blaze was in New York City at the Lonestar Cafe.
