Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Sometimes it's painful to be inarticulate. You know, to never have the right thing to say when it really matters. Like you might spend your entire life thinking you're dealing with a square because it looks like a square and acts like a square or feels like whatever. But then one day, you turn a corner and realize that actually it's not a square. It never was.

Shh! It is now my honor to invite Samantha's cousin, Sarah Bronstein, for her remarks. Sarah. Hello, everyone. My name is Sarah Bronstein. Samantha is... was my cousin. Even though we were less than a year apart in age, I've always seen Samantha as the big sister I never had. My name is David Gold, and I am Samantha's piano teacher. We never know when a tragedy will strike our community, but we do know that we, as a community, will come together after the tragedy. She had this connection to horses that I'll never be able to understand. And Samantha became a brilliant pianist. In her 18 years, she studied Torah here at Temple Beth El. And because of her, I can ride both Western and English. She was very young. I had the honor of officiating at the service when she became a bat mitzvah. And I give my condolences to the family. And I, for one, am going to miss her very much. Thank you. I will now recite the Kel Moleh Rachamim, the memorial prayer. Would you kindly rise? There will be a luncheon in the pastoral conference room downstairs where they will be collecting donations for Habitat for Horses in Samantha's honor. Carrie, Hannah, oh, thank you so much for coming. - Of course, Mrs. Goldstein. - Yeah, of course. I haven't seen you since you all were in that musical. - Do you remember that? - Mm-hmm. Oh, listen to me. Of course, you remember. Samantha loved musicals. I don't know if a lot of people knew that. She would always sing that Annie song in the shower. You know, the "Tomorrow" one? - "Tomorrow"? - Yes, right. That's it. ♪ Tomorrow ♪ She had such a good voice. Yeah, I remember we were in eighth grade choir together. She was so great. Yeah, she was like really, really good. Oh, that's so nice of you girls to say. You know, she thought the world of you two. Especially you, Hannah. It was so nice seeing pictures of you two at that big party. - Totally. - You looked so pretty. Thanks. Oh, I should probably stop rambling. I know Samantha would die of embarrassment if she knew I was carrying on like this. I'm so sorry for your loss, Mrs. Goldstein. Yeah. So sorry. So, so sorry. Thank you, girls. If you'll excuse me. Uh, what did she mean by that? What? I just didn't know that you and Samantha took a picture together at Melissa's party. Oh, I don't know. I don't really remember, but I wasn't gonna, like, correct her. - But... - Ugh, I'm starving. I think I'm gonna have a bagel. Do you want the other half? No, I'm not really hungry. Hmm, your loss. Can you believe that? It's so sad. Don't they know that Tristan would never go for any of them. Bad bone structure. - This is so messed up. - Oh, totally. It's, like, Elaina's pretty and everything, but she's not, like, a real person. I'm gonna go get a cup of water. Could you get me some? - Here. - Thanks. - Oh, my God, are you crying? - What? No. - Your eyes are red. - Yeah, because of, like, air pollution or whatever. Stop being... weird. Do you think Tristan owns that suit? I don't know. It just looks so good on him. Like, he looks really, really good. Yeah. He got hotter, right? I guess? You guess? I just don't think we should be talking about this right now. Why? Because we're at a funeral service. You didn't even know her that well. She was in, like, my AP Psych class. She was nice. We worked on a group project together. Didn't you say you had to do all the work? Yeah, no one ever does the work in, like, a group project. I remember you being, like, really mad because she said she would help you with the presentation part and then she, like, totally ghosted you. I mean, she clearly had other things on her mind. It doesn't matter, just... I just don't think we should be talking about Tristan's suit right now, okay? Are you sure you don't want a bite? Yeah. Ugh, fine. I gotta pee. What took you so long? You know I pee slow. That's why I had to quit swim team. You quit swim team because you hated running. Well, why should I have to run for swim practice? That's unfair and stupid. Ugh, I'm so bored. I mean, today has been, like, so, so sad, but now I just want to go home. I don't want to go to the stupid Teen Talk Back. Those things are always so dumb. I don't know. I feel like the best part of USY was always the intellectual debates. Or that was probably hard for you with someone's tongue down your throat the whole time. I found that pretty stimulating actually. You're so gross. Okay. At least I didn't have Ben Schwartz's hands down my pants like somebody. Yeah, you had Ben Feldman's. True. At least him stabbing me in the vagina with his boiled fingers was more fun than today. He was, like, trying to get a peanut out of a tiny bag. I want to hook up with someone who's experienced like me, you know? You've hooked up with, like, three guys. Okay, you've hooked up with one and you kept your jeans on. What? I'm just saying, if this was a competition, I would win. Yeah, I'm sure you would. Okay. Do you think I'm pretty? Don't be stupid. I think I'm like okay-looking. I'm not classically beautiful or whatever. My nose is weird. Stop it, you're pretty. Would you ever kill yourself? No, I don't think so. Neither would I. But if I did, which I wouldn't, I'd do what Samantha did. Pills are so easy. I guess you could hang yourself, but that'd be kind of hard. Slitting your wrists in the bathtub could be cool but it's so emo middle school, you know? Ugh. Shit. Do you have concealer? Concealer? Do you have some? Like, in your purse? For me, yes. For, you, no. Whatever. You can hardly see it anyway. Do you think Tristan's a good kisser? No clue. Rachel Feinstein says he's, like, really good, but she's a pathological liar. So, who knows if that's even true. Wait, didn't Tristan and Samantha used to hook up? Oh, yeah, I heard about that. But then he took Lauren Silverstein to homecoming. I remember seeing them kiss during the slow dance. So tragic. I wonder if I'm a good kisser. I thought you were "so experienced". Well, I never, like, dated anybody. So? So, I haven't exactly had any returning customers. What? Why are you looking at me like that? Stop! - Kiss me. - What? No. - Do it. - No. Please, I need to know if I'm, like, the worst kisser in the world. Okay, I can tell you right now, you're probably not the worst kisser in the world. Just pretend I'm like Zack Horowitz or something. Zack Horowitz has back hair. Okay, fine, pretend I'm someone else. - Pretend I'm Mr. Danielson. - Stop. I know you think he's so hot when he pours those beakers. "Oh, Mr. D, will you come over here and help me with something? Oops, I dropped a beaker. I know that's a safety hazard." I don't want to kiss Mr. Danielson. - Then kiss me. - No! Come on, just do it. It'll be like a second. Fine. - That doesn't count. - Yes, it does! You asked me to kiss you, so I kissed you. Okay, there's no way you determined anything from that. Okay, fine. All right, well, I guess I'll never know if I'm a good kisser or not. And then one day, I'll kiss someone and they'll be like, "That was awful." And I'll die of shame because my best friend was too- How's that? Bad? Okay. Cool. Good. Cool. Thanks. Yeah, totally. Ladies, what did I tell you about being in here? - Sorry, Moreh Klein. - We were just leaving. Good. See you in my classroom in five minutes, correct? - Yep! - Mm-hmm. Ugh, I can't believe she's the one running the talkback. It's like Hebrew School, but worse. Yeah, I think her real job is in grief counseling. Truly the last person on the planet I'd want to counsel my grief. All right, we should probably go. Yeah, yeah, um... I just need to grab my... - Oh, sorry. - Sorry. Carrie, Carrie, Carrie. Kill me. Ugh. - Did you see it? - Did you see it? - Did you see it? - You didn't see it? You didn't see it. You have to look with your eyes. You've got two of them. I'm gonna play it one more time. Look who's crying again. Why do they do that? Because they can. Everyone. Please settle down. Shalom. Shalom. Today is a terrible day. But we have this time now to process what the Jewish tradition teaches us about death, so we can grieve and be stronger together. I know this is difficult. I was in a similar situation when I was your age. At that time, I was fighting for Israel. Back then, I saw death around every corner. I was haunted like a phantom. When I slept, I dreamt it. When I woke, I saw it. And to see someone so young choose to leave this world of the living, well, I cannot explain it and I cannot justify it, but, as the Talmud tells us, we must try to understand. Now, please take these handouts. Who would've thought they'd have handouts for this? This is better than the workbooks with the mice on them. Do you remember those? Okay, I guess not. Does everyone have one? Good. Now, who would like to read aloud? Hmm, Hila. "Death is something that happens to people of all religions, but in the Jewish faith, there are particular rituals that must be done when someone passes away." Rachel Feinstein, please help your friend Rachel Grossman. Excuse yourselves if you must. - Should I keep going? - Um... Would anyone else care to read? Let's have a little fun, shall we? Um, Yitzhaka, please, continue. "There are many Jewish traditions associated with death. Some come right from the Torah, while others were developed in Eastern Europe throughout the 19th century," Yes, Hila. Moreh Klein, what do you think the great rabbis would specifically say about this situation? Interesting question, Hila. I think the great rabbis tell us that in order to understand death, we must have insightful conversations. We can't express grief with standard, shallow platitudes. Like what we're doing here today. - For Samantha. - Exactly, Miera. What was that? A cough. Did you have something to add, Yitzhaka? Um, uh, yeah. I was wondering if I should keep reading. I see. Would anyone else cared to read? - Yes, Miera. - Miera? "Some of these traditions include preparing the body by cleansing it and the ritual act of purification Tahara, in which the funeral director or, alternatively, a holy society, the chevra kadisha cleanses the body." In Samantha's case, her body would have only been handled by women to make sure it stayed totally pure. I bet Samantha would've liked that. Now, can anyone tell me the significance of these rituals? Come on, I don't want Miera and Hila to do all the talking. One of you young scholars must understand why it's important that the body be pure before burial? Fine, Miera. It's supposed to erase your social status in death. Correct. The only relationship that matters in the end is the one you have with Hashem. Yes, Hila? Um, yeah, just piggybacking off of that, I wanted to say how important it is because it shows no matter how bad things are, like, if you're dead, we always have our faith. But we have it when we're alive too. Does anyone else want to add to this discussion? Stop. Oh, my God, Hannah! Yitzhaka? Are you all right? Um... yeah, I just, I didn't have that much for breakfast. It was my fault, sorry. Uh, maybe it's time for a break. Yitzhaka, please make sure you drink some water and get something to eat. We don't need to add to today's tragedy, understood? I'll take care of her. Thank you, Hava. Hey, are you okay? Totally, I just, I lost my balance. That's all. God, I can't believe I did that, that's so embarrassing. I don't know, man. That could totally be Photoshopped. No way somebody made that on Photoshop. What about the whole, like, you know, satellite thing? Well, I mean, according to the video, this satellite... - Shut up! - You shut up. Why do we never see the boats go lower? I wonder if prom's even still gonna happen? Of course it is. They wouldn't cancel prom over one person. If anything, they should move it up so we have a distraction. Or, like, make it a memorial. - That's a really good idea. - Thanks. I just said prom should be a distraction. Oh, right. I just can't believe she won't be there. Me too. Were you guys close? That's too bad. Hey. I can't watch this fake pity party. Yeah, yeah, me neither. You wanna... - What? - You know... could go to the bathroom and... I mean, people are probably gonna be crying in there or worse, talking about me. Yeah, probably. Um... but we can check and see if it's empty, - and if it's empty, we can... - What are you talking about? If you have to go to the bathroom, go. Uh, yeah, yeah. I don't have to go to the bathroom. Okay, then what? Nothing, nothing. Never mind. - Have you seen Tristan? - No. I wonder if he went outside. That'd be so like him. It's like 20 degrees out. I know, he's so random. I wonder if I should say something to him so he, like, - knows that I'm here. - I'm sure he knows you're here. I don't know. I feel like I haven't been very, like, visible. You fell out of your chair, like, two seconds ago. Yeah, that's not the kind of visibility that I want. Plus, I don't think he noticed. He definitely saw. I thought you were gonna get, like, a concussion. Ugh, yeah. So embarrassing. Whatever. I just want him to see me how I want him to. - You know how it is. - Not really. Like, I want him to see me doing hot stuff. Like what? Do you know where we could get a Popsicle? Kidding. We'll find something else. Or, like, maybe we could practice more. You know, you said you wanted to be like a really great kisser. Yeah, and now I know that I am. I want him to, like, want me. Like, how do I get somebody to want me? I don't know. I'm sure you'll figure it out. Is it, like, my hair? I was gonna straighten it this morning, but I didn't have enough time and now it's gonna mess everything up for me. Where are you going? God. Hi. Hey. Do you vape? I, uh, don't think we're allowed to smoke in here. It's not smoke. It's cucumber, it's easily the best flavor, but they don't make it any more so my brother has to buy it on eBay. Mango's good too though. I don't want to sit in here. What are you so scared of? Nothing. Damn. I'm bored. Why don't you break me off a little piece of that brownie? Dude, you were only supposed to have, like, a tiny bite. Your brother got ripped off. If these haven't hit yet, they're not going to. Oh, hey. Sorry about your dead girlfriend. Dude, stop it, seriously? - What? I was joking. - It's not funny. No, it's fine. I mean, she wasn't actually my girlfriend so... I mean, not anymore. Oh, I'm really sorry dude. No, we didn't actually know each other. Yeah, totally. Do you want to see something cool? Dude, stop. It's fake. Let's get back to it. Hey, Trist... All right, everyone. Please turn over your worksheets from earlier. As you can see, it's divided into six panels, each representing a stage of mourning. I want you to fill in each section with how you, personally, will honor Samantha's memory. Oh, my God, don't inhale so deeply. One puff of these is like 20 cigarettes. If you keep coughing like that, you're basically done for. Thank you. So when did you first start smoking, or vaping? This summer. I wanted to impress a boy. Well, it's, like, super impressive. Do you, um, do you remember Samantha's bat mitzvah? Uh, I don't think I went. Yeah, it was the, um, it was the same day as Amy Levi's and most people didn't want to go to both, or... honestly, most people only wanted to go to Amy's. Yeah, Amy's was at the planetarium. Yeah, it was cool. And Samantha's was at that, like, weird hotel, The, um, Wagon Wheel. You know, it was, like, horse-themed. Did you go to Samantha's? Yeah, I went. My mom made me go. She said I had to go to anyone's bat mitzvah who was in my Hebrew school class. Even if we weren't friends. Plus, me and Samantha used to carpool together all the time. She lives, like, three houses down from me. Lived. I'm really sorry. Yeah. It was, like, so sad. It was, like, all adults and Samantha's little cousins and, like, the DJ kept trying to get people to dance and, like, no one did. I mean, I left right after the candle ceremony, which was humiliating. But she had a candle for all of her friends and it was just me and our other neighbor, Kim. Oh, my God, that sucks. Yeah. I wish... I mean, I don't know. I know she was weird, but, like, I wish people cared about her more. Today feels so fake. Yeah. But you two were close, right? Uh... I mean, not really, um... In elementary school, we used to, like, dance together, but, you know, like, you know, hip hop and jazz and whatever. It was so dumb. I quit when I went to middle school, um... So, I never really saw her outside of any of that except for here. But... I don't know. This feels, like, different. So, we weren't really, like, friends, I don't know why. I guess... I guess I do know why. I just never really gave her much of a chance. And now, I guess I never will. Yeah, she, like, never told anyone anything about herself. Like, it was clear she was a total lesbian. Like just come out already. We all see your haircut, - no one cares. - Yeah. Well, except for Hannah, but, like, she didn't feel the same way so... Wait, wait, what? I mean, I wouldn't want Samantha to ask me out, but I wouldn't go and tell literally everyone. Ew, why are you looking at me like that? What? Are you, like, in love with me now? Wait until I tell literally everyone. And you know what else is annoying? Why is Melissa being so needy today? Like, why are you making today all about you? You know, Samantha was, like, actually my friend, and I get that you have things going on with your parents, but, like, Samantha's dead. Yeah. Totally, I get it. Okay, well, I guess the break's almost over. This was... weird, but fun. - I guess. - Yeah. Remember that each and every one of you should always be here for one another. As the Babylonian Talmud tells us, all Jews are responsible for one another. Tragedy takes a long time to process. Super embarrassing. Thankfully, your faith will guide you through and so will your community. Did you feel this? - Uh, definitely. - Okay. And so, once everyone is finished, we will share our responses out loud and see how we can best process our grief together. - Oh, hi. - What's up? How did you think of that quick? Oh, my God. Don't even look at me. Don't look. - Uh, Moreh Klein? - Yes, Yitzhaka? Could I use the restroom? We just got back from break. I know, I just thought I felt a little bit of blood on the seat, so I thought maybe I could ask you if I could go, if not, it's okay. - Go. - Okay. Whatever. Toda, Rifkah. Now, who else would like to share? Anyone can share. There are no wrong answers. Uh-huh. I just think this whole thing is really sad and it's such a hard time for all of us. Also, I was wondering who drew this? I'm looking to commission some artwork. Dude, you do not need anymore art. You have so much. Thank you for sharing, Yihtzak. I don't know who drew it. - Obviously. - It was worth asking. Now, would anyone else like to share? And I just feel, like, I really relate to this because just the shock and the numbness, - that's phase one, like I was at camp, and so... - You okay? I was really shocked when I got that call. And then, like, there's the sadness part, which I did... Literally, every atom in my body is vibrating right now. I think still stuck in that busy-ness phase, because it really just helps me to cope with grief. Just keeping busy and, like, keeping my mind doing other things. And I just think that it would be really nice in a year from now to come back and do something similar to what we're doing today. I always light the Yehuda for my Bubbe. She passed away three years ago, but I'm still really sad - about that. - Mmm. Thank you, Miera. What? What? Sorry. Hila, would you like to share? I just thought what Miera said is powerful is all. Toda. Is that seat open? Hava, do you have something to share? - No, I'm good. Thank you. - This is a safe space and you haven't said anything all day, please, share. Mmm. Um... Okay, um... I guess I've just been thinking and... I realized that none of this matters. What doesn't matter? Um, today and everything, like... like, this class thing. I mean, none of us really liked Samantha that much, right? Right? Right, Elaina? I don't know what you're talking about. You said that none of this really matters and it's all fake and no one really cares - that Samantha's dead. - Hila, do you feel that way? Absolutely not. I never said that. You literally told me, like, an hour ago. Today is a horrible day and I don't know why you're lying - and making it worse for everyone. - I'm not lying. Maybe we should take a moment to reflect. I mean, were any of us surprised to find out that it was Samantha? Like, none of us did anything to help her 'cause we're all too caught up in our own lives. God, shut up. Hava, please. But you asked me to be honest. And I'm just tired of acting like this has some sort of greater meaning and we, like, cared so much. I mean, Samantha killed herself and nothing that we do here today is gonna change that. I know we're all exhausted, but I think we can have a productive discussion about how you feel. Well, I'm sorry being honest isn't fucking productive. Do you have a worksheet for that? If you cannot be here today, you are free to leave. My ride doesn't get here until five. Then maybe you should go into the hall and call and see if they can come get you earlier. Fine. Yes, Tzadik. - I gotta use the bathroom. - Go. Now, who else would like to share? Shabbat Shalom. How's everybody doing tonight? Oh, um... Oh, sorry. Oh, no, no. It's fine, I'm fine. Welcome to the sanctuary. So, today's been crazy boring, right? - What do you mean? - And, like, really sad too. Yeah. I mean, especially for you. Cause, like, you know? I mean, didn't you and Samantha used to... Oh, uh, that was fake. Um... Topher made that up as a joke and... 'Cause she's... She was the... the weird girl who never talked to any of the boys and she was really into yarn and it was messed up. Now it's even more messed up. That... that sucks, I'm sorry. Yeah. And, like, I feel like everyone's looking at me, like I'm, like, super upset about her dying or whatever. And that's not even true because I... That's... that's not what I... I mean, it's shit that she's dead and I guess I should have told them to stop saying all that stuff. And now this... thing. - So you two weren't close? - What? You and Samantha. You weren't close, - 'cause you didn't ever? - No, no. Yeah, same. Wait, didn't she, like, ask you out a few weeks ago? I think she thought you were, like... - Like, a lesbian... - Oh, my God, no. That's crazy that you heard that. Well, you posted it on your... Right? I mean, I could have sworn I saw on your story that you were... I mean, like, who can remember? That was all so long ago. I mean, I don't think she even meant it. Yeah. Well, I wouldn't be surprised. She never came "out" out, but, well, she never had to, you know? Yeah. Well, I guess I just wasn't that into it. - Sorry. - Because of the horses? No. Actually, yeah. No, I just... I don't know why, but at the time, it really weirded me out. It was like... like... Like maybe she just really liked you? Sorry, just being honest. Well, it's not like I would never do that. Yeah, um... have you, uh, seen Carrie around or...? Wasn't she just in class? Oh, my God, she left. Wait, why? Is she all right? I think so. Oh, my... - She went off on Moreh Klein. - What did she say? Like, just that, like, today's totally fake. Like, which it is. I think she's really cool. I think today's fake too. Yeah, like, super fake. It's, like, what are we even doing here? Plus, it's, like, today and then that's it. We're all gonna just move on with our lives. Forget about this tomorrow. Sorry, that was, like, a lot. So, uh, you and Carrie are... You guys are like best friends, right? Yeah, she's my best friend. So, is she, like, hooking up with anyone right now or...? Um, it's not... I... It's not, like, that big of a... It's not a big, uh... It's not that big of a deal or anything. I just wanted to know if she, uh... We've made out before. Yeah. We, like, make out and stuff. It's not like a thing, you know? It's whatever. Oh, okay. She's a good kisser. So am I. Oh, uh, cool. I, I guess? We kiss boys too, if you're interested. Oh, um... I don't, I don't... I mean, like, if you wanted a distraction from today, you know? I was already gonna hang out with Carrie in the library. You should join. Now? Meet me in the library in, like, 10. Um, yeah, okay. Um, are you sure? Hannah, are you sure this is like the right time to be...? Ah. Hannah, are you in here? Hannah? - Hey. - I was just calling you. Yeah, my phone's off. Where have you been? I had to get some air. Plus, it looks like I'm not the only who skipped. - I was looking for you. - That's not what I heard. Why are you being so weird? I'm not being weird. What? You're, like, um, like gaslighting me. No, I'm not. That's not what that word means. Yes, it is and you are. You're telling me that I'm being weird but I'm not doing anything. You're being weird. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. What do you want? I don't want anything from you. Stop being weird. Fine. What? Sorry, didn't mean to gaslight you again. You're being a bitch. So are you. So, why did you leave? - I had to get some air. - That's a lie. No, it's not. I wasn't feeling well, and I had to get some air. Be honest! Fine. I thought we weren't friends anymore and so I freaked out. You did? Yeah. I just couldn't sit in that classroom anymore. I felt like I was... I told Moreh Klein that I bled all over the seat. I'm sure she loved that. I thought I... weirded you out. So I thought I'd give you some space. Why would you weird me out? I don't know. It was stupid. I'm sorry. It's fine. It's just, seeing you hanging out with Elaina kind of freaked me out. - She's actually really not that bad. - Shut up. She sucks and nothing you say or do will make me change my mind. She let me hit her vape. Ew, what? Yeah, it was pretty fun. That's so gross. - What flavor? - Cucumber. Cool. Today's been, like... - so fucked up. - I know. I just keep on thinking, like, why she did it. I mean, like, I know it's a stupid question to ask, but, like, why does anyone do that sort of thing? What? Kill themselves? I mean, like, yeah. I don't know. I think she might've just been depressed, you know? You don't have to answer. We're going to be okay though. Nothing has changed between us. I mean, you still want to be my best friend, right? Yeah, I do. Okay. So there's no problem. Um... Samantha had a crush on you? - What? - Elaina told me that, um, Samantha had a crush on you and, and you told everybody, but, uh, you didn't tell me. Why does that matter? Because I'm your best friend, why didn't you tell me? Oh, 'cause it was dumb. I was drunk. You were sad about not being invited to the party. I didn't want to hurt your feelings. Well, that kind of makes me feel worse - that you didn't tell me. - She didn't kill herself - because she had a crush on me. - I didn't say that she did. Okay, so then why did you ask it like that? I didn't ask it like anything. I didn't make her kill herself. I didn't say that you did, I just... Okay, so then what were you trying to ask? Nothing! Just... just forget about it. Okay, I will. I mean, it's, like, not on you. I mean, she had other friends. I mean, like, she was... She was invited to the party and I wasn't. I guess. I should have told you. It's just, it was like... It was weird and then she died. It's whatever. I just didn't know what to do. I didn't like her like that, but she was, like, a nice person. She was. I hope she doesn't hate me. I don't want anyone to hate me. Even if they're dead. I don't hate you. I don't hate you too. You gonna go back to class? No, I think I want to do something else. Like what? My dad gets here in, like, 30 minutes. We'll find something fun to do. Okay, I don't want to, like, lay backwards on the hill outside. Neither do I. We're not in fifth grade. I want to do something more adult. Adult? Come on, trust me. We can't be sad and thinking about this for the rest of our lives. - Okay, what is it? - You'll see. Okay, so, what's the surprise? Kiss me. - What? - Kiss me. - Please. - I, uh... What the fuck? Uh, hello? Sorry. Sorry, sorry. Hey, Tristan. Hannah, what is he doing here? We're all gonna hang out, duh. Like we hung up before in the bathroom. - What? - Come on, be cool. - Uh, yeah. - Don't be jealous. I thought we were just... I thought you were just joking. I didn't think we were actually going to do this. Why wouldn't we? Can I talk to you for a second? Of course. We'll be right back. You know I've never, like... like, done this before. I mean, you've, like, kissed other people before. Yeah, but I haven't done, like, everything. I don't want this to be how it happens. Okay, well, you don't have to do that. I can do that and he'll just, like, play with you. Play with me. You know, like, touch you down there. I know what fingering is. I wasn't trying to say that you didn't. Why the hell would I want to do this? You know, I'm actually really worried about you. Don't you ever want to try this stuff? You can't avoid it forever. Tristan thinks you're so hot and cool. He literally couldn't stop talking about you. You're just saying that so you can play out your stupid, gross fantasy. It's fun. - You're using me. - No, I'm not. Tristan is only doing this because he wants to go with you because he's so, so into you. Don't overthink this. Let's just do it. Why do you even want to do this? You were, like, in love with him. I mean, we're both gonna, like, be with him. What if I don't want to? Why wouldn't you want to? Why can't you just hook up with him? I mean, I like him, I really like him, but it's so obvious that he likes you more. So I thought maybe we could share. Share, got it. It's a fun thing. It's not, like, a serious thing. You want to have sex in our synagogue. - Hook up. - Isn't that sex? I don't know, we'll just, like, see what happens. It's Samantha's funeral. Who cares? She's dead. Plus, her ghost didn't stop you from kissing me. That was... That was different. - No, it's not. - Yes, it is. You've been fucking with my head all day. - No, I haven't. - Yes, you have. You know that I like you and now you're using me so you can get with Tristan. No, I'm not. I didn't know anything. - I thought you would think this was fun. - Stop saying that. This isn't fun. I'm not having fun. I'm not going to have fun. Why did you kiss me in the first place? I told you. I wanted to know if I'm a good kisser. Okay. Okay. So, do you want to go back? - You're so selfish. - What? Do you like me at all? Yes, of course, I like you. I love you. You're my best friend. But not more than that? More than best friends? Like, you wouldn't want to hook up with me if Tristan wasn't here. No. Would you? I mean... I don't know. But you're going to prom with Ben. Just because I'm... Look, I really liked kissing you, and I thought you liked it too. Carrie, I don't think of you that way. We're like sisters. We're, like, closer than sisters, we're like... I don't know, and it's not like I don't think you're pretty, or smart, or whatever. And it's cool if you like me that way. It's, like, I just, I don't like you that way, but it's good if you do? Is everything all right? Yeah! Um, everything's great. Right, Carrie? It's nice to see you, Tristan. So, um... maybe we could hang out, just the two of us? - Is... is she okay? - Yeah. She seemed really upset. Oh, yeah, she's fine. Just a long day. Did she know this was gonna happen or...? Totally, she just, like, gets like that sometimes. I feel so bad. Don't! Don't, I mean, maybe I can make it up to you. Um... my mom works late, - so I have the house to... my house for myself. - What?! - What? Are you serious right now? - Yeah, I mean, totally. I thought we were just gonna hang out. I didn't think you actually wanted to do... - I thought it would be... - What the fuck is wrong with you? Look, I'm... I'm not interested in you at all and... Fuck, I'm sor... I gotta go. This is... It's really not a big deal. Okay, see you around! Shit. Shit. Shit. I just really need to sleep right now. Nothing feels real. Like, I can see the code in the simulation. Hey, Mom. Yeah, we just got out. I'm gonna be home later. Mr. Lowstein's gonna taking me and Carrie to get food. Ugh, seriously? Hey! Carrie, hey! Would you just look at me? What, are you, like, mad at me? Carrie. I didn't mean to hurt you. - Hey, I'm here. - Oh, my God, Carrie.
