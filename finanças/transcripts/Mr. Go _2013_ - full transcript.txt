Impossible? Turn it into possible! That's the circus! Why do reporters always ask the same questions? Sit! Amusing? Yes, it is. Fascinating? Never seen this before! Ling Ling! Hit it! The main attraction of the Yanbian Ronghua Circus is the baseball-playing, lowland gorilla, Ling Ling. He possesses the power of 20 men and weighs close to 300kg. This is his trainer, a 15-year-old prodigy, Wei Wei. Shall we take a look at their story? Spin some more! Ling Ling only shares the banana with the ringmaster. Watch your left hand. She's been with Ling Ling ever since she was born. And stupid Ling Ling thinks of her as his mother. Stupid Ling Ling. She smells like a gorilla when she comes near. Right, they're family. They're each other's only family. So they eat and sleep together! They're not a master and a beast. They're more like siblings! For some reason, young trainer Wei Wei started teaching Ling Ling the delicate art of a human language. And it was Chinese, no less. Incredible! To be able to understand over 2,000 linguistic words. But this girl is the most incredible. She's talking with the gorilla. They're communicating. Perfectly? Perfectly! But how did Wei Wei end up teaching him baseball? Baseball isn't even popular in China. The old ringmaster was a baseball fanatic. Nice! To be perfectly honest, he was addicted to gambling. He didn't even understand the game! Crazy old fart! Ironically though, Wei Wei only started liking baseball because of his gambling debt! Good, very good! The Ronghua Circus was able to gain fame thanks to the ball-hitting gorilla. But their happiness didn't last very long. The circus was soon hit with a financial crisis. It all began because of a new gorilla named Leiting. With a gorilla that can hit, he wanted another that could pitch. He really was losing his mind! Throw! Throw! Leiting is terrible! He's angry all the time! I hate him! I really hate him! Leiting, please throw! No, no. That is not right, okay? Mountain gorillas are not breedable in a man-made zoo, okay? They're very different from lowland gorillas. They're anti-social and they're aggressive. When they go wild, you can't see it coming. If that wasn't enough, another crisis fell upon them. (LET'S OVERCOME THE EARTHQUAKE TOGETHER AS A NATION) It was the Great Jilin Earthquake that claimed 20,000 lives. The earthquake swallowed everything. He got this scar because of me. While rescuing me... The circus lost the old ringmaster and Wei Wei lost her only grandpa to the earthquake. Crazy old fart... What to do with his debt now? His stubbornness got himself killed. He left this burden for Wei Wei to handle. Baseball starts at home and returns there. The ringmaster only left a huge debt. And the circus was laid in ruins so they decided to leave. The circus relocated to the neighboring Yanbian province. Mourning for her loss was a luxury she could not afford. Because she became the new ringmaster. Then came Tianjin Finance, the money lenders. We're going to wait here as long as it takes. Our position is simple. Just hand over Ling Ling, that's it. Ling Ling will fetch us 12 million yuan. And Their debt is six million yuan. They simply have no intentions of paying back. But then out of nowhere, new hope arrived! It was a surprise visit by Korea's top sports agent Sung Choong-su! I told you, I can't confirm anything, go away! He said we're close? Agent Sung's the best! He's world-class! But why did he go to China? Just look at his wrist work! That's crazy. Even without a backswing, he can hit a 160km/h pitch. He could be a big star in the Major Leagues. Is he really coming to Korea? Agent Sung was filled with conviction! So did Ling Ling pass the rigorous medical test? Our medical staff was brought in to conduct a musculoskeletal exam. After careful examination, he's the perfect gorilla... But commissioner, in the KBO's official rule book, it doesn't state that a team must consist of 9 humans. Even if he has the skills and knows the rules, this is beyond preposterous. Man is his own worst enemy. A trained animal is much safer than an irrational man. Remember this photo? The hero of Jilin. Let me hold it up for you so you can all see it. Take a look. (THE GORILLA THAT SAVED A GIRL) The 45-year-old gorilla, Ling Ling. A 6 million yuan, or $1 million debt. A circus with 43 orphans. The irreformable Leiting. And Tianjin Finance's endless harassment. Will 15-year-old Wei Wei overcome these obstacles? It's not my debt. Grandpa's dead! Stop bothering us! We'll never give him up! We'll go to Korea! "Hello! I love baseball!" Grandpa said Korea is the land of baseball. We'll make money and pay back the debt. And start a new circus! Circus of the Sun! Circus of the Sun! I love baseball! That scene in particular is heartbreaking and so moving every time I see it. Mr. Secretary, shall we collect the ballots? We're all done. Gentlemen, we'll collect the ballots. If this really works, we're getting 50% of Jamsil Stadium's ticket revenue, right? It's a done deal then. Is that even a question? It's Doosan we're talking about. Enough chatter! He's a man of his word. Aren't you, GM Kim? Indeed. Can we stop talking about money? We just watched such a moving story. How could you all talk about only money, money, money? Can't we approach it with a humane point of view? Can't we? You really are something. Still thinking like an athlete. For peace on earth, out of love and compassion, you've rescued a gorilla. Commissioner! Sir! What are you doing here?! I'm here as the Doosan Bears's scout. Please have some respect, Sir. My respect is not for scumbags like you. You've sold off every decent player to the US. And as if that's not enough, you even sold off kids! How are they all doing nowadays? How well did your Doosan GM do in Japan? Agent? You're just a bounty hunter! The result of the vote is, 9:1, 9 for, and 1 against. As per Doosan's request for a gorilla player... Commissioner, did I ship them off to die? They were going to end up in the Major Leagues or in Japan, raking in millions! Reporter Kim, the result's out. It's 9 for 1 against. Release the article immediately. The league has spoken so within today, I said today! Give me the seal. How dare you! Mr. Commissioner! Mr. Commissioner! I'll kill that jerk! Let go of me! Let go of me! You jerks, get off me! Yeah, yeah, good afternoon. How have you been? Mr. Agent? Yes, is Ling Ling practicing hard? Practice? Yes. Baseball practice. I told you to practice regularly. We'll start when we get the contract. Contract? Is that a threat? So, where's our contract and deposit? You'll get it! One as thick as my arm! Anyway, don't miss the flight tomorrow! Got that... Emergency! Stop practice! Get to your hiding spots! Hide here! Hurry, hide here! Hurry, hurry! Get out! Get out! Jo Wei Wei! Jo Wei Wei! (LING LING) Come on, come on! Come on, come on! Boss. I'll pay you back, I promise. Why pay? Don't bother. Make a lot of money and keep it. Why trouble yourself? We just want that gorilla. Ling Ling, the baseball star. The key, little miss. You got a knack for making things worse. Guess you are testing my patience... Ronghua Circus never bows to the forces of evil! Ronghua Circus never bows to the forces of evil! Forces of evil? Leiting! Stop it! Stop! Enough! Stop! That's enough, Leiting! Boss, look. Leiting, be quiet! Stop it! This is why you're in chains! Please just stop! It's "Sunny", not "Sony". You can't even write your own name. I don't like Sunny. So dumb. I'll make lots of money and never come back. I'll study hard, ringmaster. And when the loan sharks come back? Ronghua Circus never bows to the forces of evil! Ronghua Circus never bows to the forces of evil! Let's go! Ringmaster! Don't come back empty-handed! Make lots of money! We have to open Circus of the Sun! Ringmaster! Ringmaster! Ringmaster! Wei Wei! Over here! Wei Wei! Over here! Wei Wei! Over here! Over here, come! Stay calm. Over here! Coach, you look worried. Hurry up! He remembers me. He's happy to see me. That's how he greets people. I didn't think he'd remember me after such a brief encounter. Welcome! Ling Ling! I said behave! Yeah, I remember you too! Good to see you! Welcome! Hi! - I'm Lee Jung-min from ESPN. - Yes. Ms. Zhao, where did you learn Korean? You can't live in Yanbian without speaking Korean. How do you communicate with the gorilla? Ling Ling. Ha Byung-chun from Yonhap News. A question for Doosan GM. How did you even think of acquiring a gorilla? Do you still think humans rule this world? Just because we can talk... You brought an x-ray when we sent Choo Shin-soo off to the States. Some gibberish about his ligament. He hits 30 home runs in the States and got a third kid on the way. Do you read the papers? And Doosan's GM? He retired early because you didn't listen. This is a similar situation. The gorilla's knee is in bad shape. This is the spirit of Doosan. We have to report it this time. Report what? Your body swept on the banks of the Han River? Or that your entire family died in a house fire? Is that what you want? You know what I can do. Keep your mouth shut. Who else knows? The orthopedics manager. Tell him to give me a call. And take your family out to a nice dinner. I have a question for Wei Wei. Why do you like baseball? In baseball... It's a game you start at home and return home. That's why. A game that starts and returns to home. She's got an interesting philosophy. Anyway, Mr. Go's official... He has to stay in there. Nowhere else. I won't repeat myself. Mister, how did you get so rich? Just you wait, you'll be living like this soon Why do people call you the "bounty hunter"? Curious? Aren't you a baseball fan? Then you must know Chang-yong, Sun-woo, Shin-soo, Tae-kyun, Hyun-jin, and Byung-hyun. I got them all signed to American and Japanese clubs. I'm an Asian super agent. But people say I sold them off. Such a skewed opinion. That' how I got the nickname. I don't care about Korean baseball. So boring. You'd better quickly fall in love with Korean baseball. Make an extra effort to love it. Got that? You hear me? What? He's making his bed. This is why I said it's better that he stays inside a house. It's hinoki. From a Fukuoka seedling... - So? - It's incredibly rare. It was worth $60,000. $60,000? Yeah. Including importing fees. He'll behave better if he can stay inside the house with me What? He'd better stay away from my orchids. Go ahead, Ling Ling. Go on. Hurry! Stop! Stop! Right there! That's enough. If he wanders off, he'll get a bullet. That's a real rifle. You know what I mean? That beast will die. I will, got that? Mister. I need $800,000 by National Day. I have to pay off the debt. Young brat, already haggling me about money. You need a lesson. Follow me outside. When will I see the contract and deposit? Soon! You need $1 million, right? It's not my debt. Fine, add a zero at the end. $10 million! 55.13 million yuan! One more! $100 million! 551.3 million yuan! You're smarter than you look. Now, that's our target. What you said... $100 million! We only need $1 million. Then we can open Circus of the Sun. What? Circus? Of the Sun?! All that hard work for so little. There's no reward at the end. There's only illness awaiting you at the end. I got diabetes! So, what should we do then? Oh... That idiot. No. This isn't our home. Our home is over there. Really far away. I'll continue, so listen carefully. We'll go to the USA. But why did we come to Korea first? To verify his skills. Korea is just a starting point, a launch pad for our dreams! Our first touchstone. Why, you scared? We got to go for it! If there is a door, we open it. If it's open, we go in. If there's someone inside, just say hello. We'll do what we always did best. Just like what you did in China. Sounds good, right? You'll do good, right? It's a massage, chill. It means he likes you. It's mimicking you. Anyway, tomorrow's the first game. Let's fire this place up! Let's show them! Wei Wei! Where could she be? Ronghua Circus never... Did she run off? Run off with Ling Ling? Tranquilize him. - You sure? - Do it! Okay, okay... (LEITING) What should we do? - Go! - Get him! - Blow! - Do it! Keep going! More! Welcome back everyone. Today marks Mr. Go's controversial and historic debut. The Doosan Bears have fallen on hard times lately. Many of their fans have left. I bet NC must be utterly stumped to be the gorilla's first opponent as well. NC's coach looks flabbergasted. He's belittling Doosan. Wouldn't you? Rather than going to the plate, Mr. Go is following Wei Wei. That's understandable. He's not used to the stadium. It's an animal instinct to stay with its master. Imagine from his eyes, he must be so afraid with so many people. This could start a new chapter in KBO history, or end up as an event. I'd say the latter. It'll just be a spectacle for the fans. - This won't amount to anything. - Go. Mr. Go is still following her. Wei Wei looks frustrated. She's embarrassed as his master. He's probably dazed and confused. He's lost, he can't tell if this is a zoo or a stadium. I see. Go over there! Wei Wei is making weird sounds. She's telling him to take his place. You see that often in National Geographic. I watched it last night because I couldn't sleep. Is that so? Finally, he's heading for the home plate. He just sat down on the ground. How would you interpret that? He's sulking at her for telling him to go away. It's a form of expression. "I'm angry, I don't want to talk to you." Ling Ling! Get up! Can the game continue like this? He's just sitting. It's up to the umpire. He has sole discretion on the game. The pitcher can play as usual. It's a man's game, the animal has to adapt. Mr. Go and the first pitch! A huge hit! Toward the right field! It flies into the crowd. It's a foul to the right side. See? See? He smashed Moon's 128 km/h curve pitch! How is this possible? He was sitting down! He's got the power. I'll give him that. Moon has to stop chewing on gum. He has to focus! How dare he... - Ling Ling! - He can throw 150km/h. How dare he chews on gum? He has to concentrate! Mr. Go is still sitting down. Here's Moon's second pitch. Another huge hit! Left side of the field this time! It's a foul! Foul! He hits another monstrous foul while sitting down. What is he thinking? Moon's got this all wrong! What did I tell you? Only a fastball will do! His breaking ball isn't good enough! The gorilla's toying with KBO! Stick it to the ape! Ling Ling! Do it right! Look at that, Mr. Go gets up on his feet! Has he finally adjusted to his surroundings? Just throw a fastball! The ape won't be able to hit his powerful fastball. NC's ace Moon looks rather nervous. What for? There's no reason to be. I'm telling you right now, a fastball will set him straight. It's simple. - Teach the ape a hard lesson! - Keep it low! Low! A lesson he won't forget. Home run! A shot down center field. It punctured the jumbotron! How is this possible?! He smashed Moon's 158km/h pitch! An unprecedented event just unfolded before our eyes! Bases loaded again. Mr. Go inevitably steps up to the plate! He was given permission to play without a helmet. See that pumping chest motion? He's confident! What will he show us today? The crowd is reacting thunderously! The pitcher winds up and the first pitch! Ling Ling, hit it! Mr. Go! It goes high! Ling Ling! Hit it! Where's he looking? He hits without even looking! It's a grand slam! - Mr. Go! - Mr. Go! This is Lotte and Doosan's 8th game of the season! First pitch! It's going, going, over! It hits the fence! And falls inside the field! Ling Ling, run! - It's a hit! - He's has to run! It's not a homer! Run! Run! The outfielder slips and falls! Mr. Go is running! It's a close game! To third base! He hurls the baseman. Heading for home plate! Mr. Go charges! The catcher jumps out of the way! We're at Jamsil Stadium for Doosan and NC's 10th game. NC leads. With the bases loaded, Mr. Go is at bat! What's this? NC deliberately pitches behind him. This isn't baseball. That's devious. They'll avoid facing him altogether? They'll give away a run, but not 4. There's nothing Mr. Go can do. Choi too is also going for a walk. Kim directs the ball away from the plate. He nods with satisfaction. Mr. Go looks unhappy. Aimed at his face! This is so wrong! Do it right! - He rolls the ball! - What? What's he thinking? This isn't baseball! Fans will ridicule this moment. He hits it! Mr. Go swung the bat like a golf club! He hit it like it's nothing! That was a warning shot! He'll play by any rules! You can't fool him! And Kim's 4th pitch! He jumps! A backflip! And smashes it over the fence! That backflip home run is his 19th of the season! - Home run! - Out of the park! Mr. Go's 22nd home run! Doosan climbs the standings from dead last to a playoff contention! This marks NC's 5th consecutive, embarrassing loss against Doosan! NC must feel so helpless. What can they do? What is it? Why are you calling so early? This better be good! Listen carefully. The Chunichi Dragons sent an acquisition proposal to our office. Could you repeat that, please? More good news! The Yomiuri Giants sent theirs at the same time! One more time! With passion! It's as if! They planned it together! Both teams sent their proposals at the same time! Two top rivaling Japanese clubs are foaming at the mouth! And the tone of both proposals are incredibly polite and formal. It's not like the other times! I couldn't believe my eyes! - Reject it. - What!? You heard me. Don't play deaf. Reject both of their offers! If they're serious, tell them to come in person. They can't order us around! If they send over idiot scouts to haggle over salary and waste our time like before, they have another thing coming. If they're serious, tell them to call me. Unless their GMs directly call me, I probably won't answer. It's for you. Don't bring it up before the Doosan GM, the commissioner, and the press get the official word! To clarify, don't even respond to the current offers. Just shred the documents. What if we get caught? If they ask about it later, say you never received it or it got lost in the files, okay? So why is his wrist angle different? Don't you dare! If he turns his wrists improperly, it'll become a foul. So Mr. Go twists his wrist inward to hit his home runs. It's simply incredible. The more I learn about him, the more I'm in awe. I'm a believer now. Let's see what we got next. Hurry, there's a ceremonial first pitch. Go on ahead. I'll go later. The club chairman is coming to see him play. Ling Ling, come on! Bottom of the 5th, 1 out, runners on 1st and 2nd. And they have Kim Do-soo on bat. He can't gamble, he has to play smart. They're down by 2 and he needs to get on base. He must bunt. And he does. Kim goes for the bunt! He bunts between the pitcher and the first baseman! Safe! He's safe! The bases are loaded now! Isn't this the right moment to bring out Mr. Go? What a great game today. Doosan's owner is in attendance for this precise reason. We see him there on the screen. The chairman of Doosan Group. He's a fierce man! A renowned figure in the financial industry. - Tied up good? - Very firmly. This isn't my fault. You're responsible for this. Boss, more tranquilizer? That's enough! Let me talk! I'm sorry. You alone are responsible for this. Tie him up! Tranquilize him! Tranquilize him! Tie him up! He saw me! Keep shooting! Don't stop! Thank you for your patience, Sir. With the bases loaded, Mr. Go is coming out now. She's not going to answer? That brat. Forcing me into a uniform after 20 years? I don't see Wei Wei today. It's just Mr. Go. Isn't that Ling Ling's agent? Yes, he's an old man now, but he was a ball player briefly. He and I played in the minors too. He's perfectly capable of coaching despite his age. Hey, Ling Ling! Agent Sung is filling Wei Wei's coaching spot! Let's see how he'll direct Ling Ling. - Here's the 1st pitch! - Swing! Mr. Go didn't react to the pitch at all. He must be confused. On National Geographic, such actions and behavior suggest inner confusion. He can't find Wei Wei. Why isn't he playing? He will soon. Perhaps Mr. Go didn't understand the signal. - Right, he needs a clear signal! - Ling Ling! Sung's signal feels off. Yes, just like that. The whip is wrapped around his neck! The first base coach is choking! - Strike! That's strike 2! - Sorry, I'm sorry! - Again, Mr. Go does not react! - Ling Ling! Look! What's going on? Sung's not doing it right! - That's it! Swing it hard! - Swing! What is he doing? He hit his own face this time. - Swing! - I hope he's not badly hurt. This is frustrating. I said swing! Yoon's windup! A deep drive! It's going, going! - Still going! It's a big hit! - Ling Ling! Run! Just run! Run! - Watch out! - Out of the way! - It's not the ball! - Watch out! It's the bat! Out of the way! The bat strikes a spectator. I hope they are not badly injured. A direct hit. Right in the forehead. This is unprecedented. He's being carried out of the stadium. This marks Mr. Go's first ever strikeout. Ling Ling, come back. Sung should've stayed in the dugout. It didn't look like Mr. Go did it intentionally. Oh... No... What is Mr. Go doing? He wants to run. There's no Wei Wei and he wants to get away. I hope there won't be another incident. Mr. Go, please come back. The reason for showing you everything... Without editing... it's to show you how much pain we've been suffering. Tianjin Finance's motto is courtesy and precision and we gave you a loan courteously. So even if you got beef with me, pay us back precisely. Stop it! The kids won't keep their hands up. You're despicable... Why is this happening to me? Money? You borrowed it. And you refused to pay it back. You're the one who fled to Korea... But people will think I'm the bad guy. What did I ever do? I didn't do anything wrong. My tooth... I lost a tooth. You're despicable... - It'll be hard to go on. - Game called! It's over! The umpires have decided to cancel the game. Surprised? Isn't this what we expected? What did I tell you? That's an animal. A beast! This is too much even for us. - Should we wait? - For what? Call 911 now! Fine, I'll give you a month. No, make that three months. Three months to make your money with the gorilla. If you don't... I shouldn't do this... But there's no other way. There's nothing I can sell. Stand up. There's nothing, except these kids. Are you going to kill me? I'm begging you, Wei Wei. - Are you going to kill me? - No, I'm going to sell you! Current altitude 2,500 ft, approaching the stadium. Dispatched to suppress the emergency situation. What is it? Out of my way! Why is he peeling a banana? Get ready to fire! Yes, sir. Don't Shoot! Don't do it! Roger, permission granted. Fire! Don't shoot! No! Dodge it! (STANDARD MANAGEMENT CONTRACT) The target may be in danger if we fire now. You idiots! Are you making King Kong 2? Just shoot! Please stop this. Send the helicopter back! Fire! Fire! Suppress target! Climb! Climb up! Get away, helicopter! Send it back! It's my gorilla! Send off the helicopter and assemble the GMs. 00-8426 confirm evacuation from current location. Returning to base. This is insane. Darn it! During the Doosan versus NC game today at Jamsil Stadium, Doosan Bears's Mr. Go caused chaos during the game. Mr. Go threw his bat into the crowd and caused an accident. So why let a gorilla play baseball? Don't you think? It's embarrassing. It's a total circus. It caused a heated debate. (KBO RESTRICTS MR. GO TO PLAY ONLY AT HOME GAMES) Doosan claimed it was an accident. KBO voiced fear for the fans' safety. The KBO held an emergency meeting with all nine general managers to decide the fate of Mr. Go and restricted him to play only at home games during the remaining season. Get down! Enough! Get down! Yes, he'll come on the show. Swap the order. It tapes once a week. Idols groups are a dime a dozen these days. Right! You'll get a rating as high as your blood pressure! I'm done! Where on earth were you? Sir, this contract. Something's wrong with it. Go away! Who told you to act up?! Lie down! Sir. My signature is not on this contract. And where's the $300,000 shown here? You read Korean well, but only the parts you want to read. It's written there, 30% of that $300,000 goes to the agent. I don't have to tell you how I spent my money, Stand up! But he eats $10,000 bamboo a month. Got it? The rest of the money will be paid after the season. That is, if he completes the season! That's a pipe dream now. $300,000! Where is it?! Where's my $300,000! Tell me! Where is it! No one got hurt, it was an accident! It wasn't what we wanted, but they put it on themselves. I hope KBO recovers quickly. Mr. Go is amazing. Truly an amazing animal. Quite lovable too. But he's still an animal. Is this the final decision? This is for the fans' safety. It's the least penalizing outcome. Let me through. Don't follow me! You ruined everything! I hate you! In light of Mr. Go's rampage today, KBO will not retract its decision despite Doosan's appeal. KBO is considering the possibility of a damage claim suit. KBO will also request a player evaluation of Mr. Go to prevent any future relapse of the incident that took place today... (MR. GO, SUSPENDED FROM AWAY GAMES) It's all right. Bring it. Bring everything. Bring them all. I'm so drunk. Cheers. You sure know how to drink. Our Ling Ling is devouring a $3,000 Fox Brush Orchid. Cheers! They call me the bounty hunter, who hunts men. I sold them all! To the USA, Japan... But you're the first one I took in. It's for me? No, not this. It's a $8,000 wild plant from Halla Mountain. Don't eat it! You're looking after me? That's why I like you. Humans complain no matter how well you treat them. So ungrateful, they think they earned it themselves. You need $1 million, right? I have a plan. Commercials! Mass appeal! Safe animal! It's all within my grasp! Okay? So don't worry and drink! I told you! Not this one! No more munchies. Idiot, you'll damage your liver. I noticed you had fatty liver in the med exam report. This is good for the liver. Open wide. That's it! Here you go. How is it? KBO called an emergency meeting and restricted Mr. Go to home games. Having forfeited the game and their power-hitter penalized, Doosan will not pay the full incentive that was agreed upon in the contract. Many fans are baffled by the unexpected incident and are questioning the safety of the animal. From China's national hero to a dangerous animal... I know exactly what you want. It was painful to keep it on, wasn't it? From now on... You are free. Sir. Sir! Sir! Is this appropriate? Yeah, just do what I tell you... From today, he'll be known as a safe animal... That's it! That does it! You're my new rug on the floor! How dare you ruin my tree! Why did you let him drink? So stupid! Serves you right. Welcome back to Lemon Tree. Our next guest is a real special... someone? Pardon me. He really is a VIP. You might be afraid of him... You're not? No! Let's welcome Doosan Bears's Mr. Go and Zhao Wei Wei. A big round of applause! He's wearing a Hanbok! Send him to her! You see! He's tamed! (JAMSIL BOND LING LING) Of course, of course! He'll do commercials! Yes, everything! It's simple. Just run like this, you see? He can't. - Like this. - Like this? Yeah, that's it. Ms. Zhao, how much does Mr. Go weigh? He weighs around 300kg. 300kg? But it looks like he's 30kg. Mr. Go's 300kg weight doesn't affect the machine at all! - Mr. Go is not running, - Wei Wei, get him up, hurry! - He's going after his dreams... - Ling Ling, get up! You should be paying us for causing such a scene! Next up is a piece of miraculous news. Doosan began the season as the league's worst team, but thanks to Mr. Go, they've risen to fourth place. Next up, we have news on China's beloved gorilla, Ling Ling. Ling Ling has helped Doosan Bears to the playoffs. Since his acquisition in July, Ling Ling has hit a total of 37 home runs in the second half of the season. Leiting, show me what you got! Very good! Very nice! Let's stick it up to the world that shunned us! Doosan expressed their confidence in taking the Korean Series. With Ling Ling, isn't it possible? 1.6 billion Chinese citizens are watching his every move. Sung Choong-su! Choong-su! Big news! Big news! What? I told you to shred them. We can't have any evidence lying around. They sent it again. The Chunichi and Yomiuri owners will come at the same time. You see? See? I did what you told me to do and we hooked them good. It's Doosan's first postseason Home Game. Bottom of the 8th, tied at 3, 1 out, and here comes Mr. Go! NC can't wriggle their way out of this one. Can they afford to give up four runs? - It's NC's fault. - Ling Ling!! They allowed three hits and now the bases are loaded. 4 runs in 8th will clinch it! NC's Moon... Weird, he's holding the ball. They're using the 12-second rule. It's an ingenious plan. When the umpire calls play, the pitcher has 12 seconds to throw or it's a ball. He'll allow a walk and give Doosan a free run. The umpire calls the first ball. Rather than give up four runs, they'll eat a run. Yes, they're confident they can catch up by the 9th. Four runs now will seal the game. Doosan fans are tossing bananas and telling him to lie down. - Mockery and bananas. - Ling Ling! - It's part of the game now. - Lie down! Mr. Go is now Doosan's superstar. Wei Wei signals Mr. Go to lie down. What a dull play. Mr. Go must be bored too, just waiting. What did the commissioner say? He's happy. He wants 30% of the deal for the league development fund. He'll even adjust all trade rules. Of course, he will. He gets rid of an eyesore and pockets some money too. Does your GM know? Did you mention anything? You said not to. I told him nothing. We're all finished if this leaks before the deal. The league and me too. First news item of the day. Chunichi Dragons owner Ito Hiroshi has arrived in Korea. The purpose of his visit is still unknown. It's very rare for a Japanese club owner to fly in. Some critics are saying he's here to acquire Mr. Go. Mr. Hiroshi refused to comment on his visit at the airport, adding more mystery. Mr. Go's walk brings home a runner and Doosan takes the lead. Game 2 of Division Finals, bottom of the 9th, tied at 4, and two outs. Doosan runners on 1st and 2nd, can they load the base? Right, NC can't allow that. Or they'll be facing Mr. Go. 2 and 2, Ahn readying the 5th pitch. Here it comes! Ahn swings, it flies just above the pitcher's head! The shortstop slide catches! He throws it to the first! Safe! He makes it! Bottom of the 9th, bases loaded with 2 outs! The stage is ripe for Mr. Go, isn't it? It sure is, hear that music? A grave situation for NC! For the players, their fans also. A transfer fee of 2 billion yen and an annual salary of 1 billion. That's our offer. $30 million as transfer fee and $15 million as an annual salary. It's the highest offer in Chunichi club's history. Pardon me, pardon me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Losing by a run or four, either way, it's the same lose for them. Kim must see it through. Doosan takes the game with a climatic hit! Can you put a price on this? Let's see that in slow motion! That's a perfect hit! Utterly perfect! With Tremendous power, Mr. Go hits a grand slam and wins Game 2 for Doosan. Even my circus? - Yeah. - And all the debt too? Yeah, it's $100 million! Awesome! I have to let the kids know! You're the best! So when do we sign? We won't. I got a debt to pay. And open Circus of the Sun! You little brat. We need to start a bidding war with Yomiuri, they're rivals. We need to turn up the heat. Why would we do that? So he'll be worth more! You daft girl! They'll outbid each other. You don't get many chances in life. It's easy to miss them completely. You train him to do weird stuff. Next up on our program. It's the talk of the town. Doosan won two straight Division Finals games against NC. Let's see the highlights. Mr. Go's extra run yesterday and his grand slam at today's game led to their victory. NC GM Jang Woo-won openly expressed his frustration during the game. A scuffle between NC's pitcher and catcher became a much-discussed topic. Perhaps the grand slam was too much to swallow. Their teammates stepped in, but even they couldn't hold them back. The coach and his staff could only watch from the dugout. Sir. What's this? Did you order Chinese food? Um, no, we didn't. It's gotten much worse. His cruciate ligament is about to sever. I could care less about diagnosis. You're the doctor. What's the treatment? - Knee surgery right away. - What? Then at least six weeks in a cast. Six weeks? Ever been bitten by a gorilla? Wei Wei, order him! Attack. Please don't! Stop. When do you need him? Game 3 tomorrow. Tomorrow. Just bite me. - Don't move. - Are you nuts?! Let's observe for a few days with morphine and a leg brace. You already won two games. Even if you lose the 3rd and 4th, you still got the 5th. Let's give him time to heal, okay? He's here. Yomiuri Giants owner Inoue Daichi also flew in today. With the arrival of two Japanese club owners not divulging their purpose of visit, the visit of both club owners... Due to NC stadium's construction, all games will be played at Jamsil. It's Game 3 of the division finals! Top of the 9th, 1 out, bases loaded for Doosan. It bounces off the pitcher's foot! 2nd base to 1st! Kim is out at first. With this double play, the game comes to an end. Doosan just didn't have it today. Their fans won't take it lightly. Mr. Go should've come out to finish the game. Yes, Mr. Go was absent for unknown reasons. Doosan fans are protesting his mysterious absence. Sung... Sung Choong-su... answer me... Here? Is he here? The Doosan GM's going crazy looking for you. You can't just remove a player from the roster! Let's chat later. I understand fully. Let's go inside. It's a done deal. He agreed to double Chunichi's bid. Both the transfer fee and salary. He wants to sign tomorrow. Thank you so much. We'd like to conduct a medical exam. A medical exam? This is our team doctor Tetsuo. Allow him to conduct the exam and send me the results before I leave. Doctor? I see. I expect you won't negotiate any further with Chunichi. (ANIMAL HOSPITAL) I never even got to treat my mother's arthritis, but here I am in a vet hospital storage room, fixing a gorilla's knee. Not even a normal pet. I didn't spend 10 years in med school for this. Please get up! He wants to play. But you're already quite old in human years. Don't move! Ling Ling! I've had it! He's not really hurt. He's just mad at me. Do I have to cut off his leg to make you understand? Cut off whose leg? Who? Ling Ling! Everyone out! I can't concentrate on this simple procedure! It won't happen! He won't lose his leg! He can't lose his leg! Wei Wei! Where are you going?! She's a brat, that one. Shut up! Chunichi Dragons versus Yomiuri Giants. The biggest rivals in Japanese baseball. Both club owners arrived at the same time, but the reasons for their visit is still a mystery. You got nowhere else to go. Just look at that glum face. Get up, come on. It's not polite to kick a person. I said get up! Don't make me angry! You're a liar! You hid Ling Ling's injury!! So, you got a weapon, huh? You're not the only one! I got one... Where's my gun? I'm a liar? You can supposedly talk to him. How did you not know he was in pain? Be honest now, you shrew! You're the liar, aren't you? I think you know him the least! Always that whu-whu nonsense! I know my Ling Ling! I fed him and raised him! I'm his master! Of course, I understand him! I know everything he's saying! This is Leiting from China. NC has acquired Zeros, a pitching gorilla. Let's take a look at his arrival. (NC DINOS SIGNS CHINESE GORILLA ZEROS) Why can't NC acquire a gorilla too? Will you put him in the game today? Is it so weird to see a pitcher doing what he does best? Will Zeros really play in the game? It's very likely that he will. No, not Leiting... Division Finals Game 4, top of 9th, 2 outs, runners on 1st and 2nd. After losing Game 3, Doosan is facing another loss. Kim is gesturing for a bunt. Fake bunt to a full swing! Is this one final whimper for Doosan? Mr. Go won't come out today either? He has to! It's Game 4. There's no reason to keep him out, is there? Is Yomiuri being rather particular? We'll cut yesterday's figure by half. We'll meet all of your terms. He is worthy of our agreement. How about a medical test in Japan next spring? Since elementary school, I've had the same barber cut my hair. For 30 years now. Amazing. It means I'm a man of trust. I grant you my trust. Thank you very much! Get the contract, hurry! - Bring it! - The contract? - Hurry! Get it! - Got it. No one has seen anything like this before. Here's the replay in slow motion. This is a first for me too. Where else can you see that?! Where would you like to sign... Whose gorilla is that? What kind of player is Zeros? His real name is Leiting, it means "thunder." He's not the same species of gorilla as Mr. Go. It's known to be an aggressive kind. Strike, out! Brutal! His pitch is practically an assault! An incredible relief pitcher has raised NC up from the dead. Now, Doosan's series win is not a sure thing anymore. What a perfect timing! - Mr. Go! - Mr. Go! Where did you stash my gorilla? I brought you back from the dead to become a GM. How dare you call me like that? Have some respect. You want to die too, right? Out, get out of my car! Tomorrow's the final game! For your sake and that Chinese girl too. I hope it isn't your final day. Drive. We're at NC and Doosan's Final Playoff Game. We're about to begin Game 5. Today's match will determine everything. Mr. Go's appearance will be the decisive factor. As you saw yesterday, Zeros will also contribute heavily to today's outcome. Wei Wei, hurry up! Get ready! We met up with Zeros's agent, Lin Xiaogang prior to the game. How did you train the gorilla? With love and concern! Why did they have to show up now? Humans lack these qualities. That's why they make irrational decisions. You think he's angry? No. He's just hot because he grew up in the mountains. He's not used to lowland. So he grunts a lot to cool himself down. He's not angry. Wei Wei! We have to go! Wei Wei! Listen carefully. This is a painkiller. It's morphine-based. Give him 20cc when in pain. Can't tell if it's enough for that thing... Anyway, only as a last resort. If you give him too much, it'll tranquilize him. - Got that? - Got it. It's the last resort, but what if he doesn't get up? If he doesn't walk, then you won't either. Kiss your legs goodbye, you hear me? Answer me. I got it. Get ready. My baby! He's something, isn't he? He understood that gorilla perfectly. Love and concern, big praise to his agent. If you watch National Geographic, animals feel loneliness too Especially those away from their habitat. We must treat them with love. Top of the 5th, it's a tie. 3 to 3. A scoring opportunity for NC. They must bring home the runner on second. That's Chunichi's Ito. As we speculated, they're negotiating for Zeros. That means, the purpose of Ito's visit was to acquire Zeros. We have to stop them! Are you asleep? Sleeping again? Powerful gorilla my ass! More like a senior citizen. You should be in your prime. But then again, you're 70 in human age. People at that age eat out of a straw and use diapers. But why now of all times? Just one more bat, Ling Ling! I don't need a home run, just stand there. Keep your leg up, don't move. Lie down. Yes. Lie down and stay still. I'll be back, I have to stop the signing. - Mr. Sung. - Yeah? Ling Ling's asleep. It's the painkiller, wake him up. Wake him up! Sir. What now! When I... speak to Ling Ling... I don't understand him, just like you said. I only grunted at him because people liked it when I did that. So I kept doing it. I... don't understand him at all. You were right about everything. You figured it all out. It's okay. He understands you. He really does. Bottom of the 7th, man on 2nd, Doosan on the offensive! They're a run behind but Doosan can come back! A hit! To the right field! The runner rounds third and heads for home! It falls in front of the right fielder! No! Don't run! You won't make it! The right fielder throws home! Head-to-head at home! He's tagged out! A throw to second! And another out! A sudden double play! Nothing's going right for Doosan. They blew a golden opportunity! This is looking bleak. Bad plays under pressure. The players know it too. They need a big hit. Doosan's on their last leg. They need Mr. Go now more than ever. I don't understand at all. This is the time for Mr. Go. Mr. Ito! Mr. Ito! Mr. Ito! He hasn't signed Zeros yet. Mr. Ito! Mr... Go have a summit, a G3 summit. Why bother calling me at all? I told you, it's all over once Zeros is signed. Didn't I tell you to stay alert and watch them closely? Move aside. Move! Choong-su, hold on! Mr. Ito! Mr. Ito! Mr. Ito! Mr. Go is going to play! You must not sign right now. Please wait a little longer. Just listen to our new terms. Mr. Ito! Zeros is a vicious gorilla! Mr. Ito! Please open this door. - We're done. - Ito! You stupid fool! That's a 30-year-old hair style? You look like an idiot! - You know what we call that? - Choong-su, stop it! Bucket style! You hear me?! Ito is a pervert! Ito, you stupid! - What? - Over there! You idiot! Sung Choong-su! How dare he use the word "pervert"? Top of the 8th, NC starts inning with Kim Jin-sik at bat. They're at each other's throats. End of the season for the loser, they must not hold back. Swinging at the first pitch! To the outfield! Diving catch! He caught the ball! Fierce competitiveness from both teams! Very good! It's a war of nerves! The game's heating up! (HUMAN DOCUMENTARY, COMPANIONSHIP) Why did he want us here too? Choong-su, this is it. We have to sell them all. Mr. Secretary will take care of any legal issues that come up. Huh? What kind? As NC's offense continues, Zeros warms up in the bullpen. He's got a temper... Her grandfather said, "This child is a blessing." No one knows who Wei Wei's parents are. No one knows where Ling Ling came from too. After traveling halfway around the world, Ling Ling and baby Wei Wei became a family. It's nothing special. All the children of Ronghua became family this way. The runner heads for home! He's safe! Kim Taek-gyun throws home! It's up to the catcher! That was quick! Dodged it! Safe! It's safe! If I made you upset by requesting a medical exam, I apologize profusely. Losing to Chunichi is an unbearable insult. Please defeat Zeros in this final game. If you can make that happen, I'll accept all your terms. This is a blank check. Write whatever amount you deem worthy. Come in. Take the check. They must not give up! The game's not over. I'm still waiting for Mr. Go to show up! I believe in Mr. Go! Kim Do-su's clean hit to the left field! A bottom of the 9th miracle, bases loaded for Doosan. Doosan has a fighting chance! There are still no outs. But here comes Zeros! Letting his presence to be known! NC's special relief pitcher is approaching the mound! It was an era of circus. Animals jumping through hoops... You hid this from us all this time? This is low, even for you. It wasn't this serious before. Why did you make that call? Who gave you the right to hide this from me? Drag him out and put him in the game. Before things get dirty. How? On crutches? GM Kim! Calm down! The Great Jilin Earthquake wiped out everything. You should know better! It swallowed the circus, along with the ringmaster, and even young Wei Wei. Time passes. Exhausted children and the rescue team leave the site of earthquake. I'll take full responsibility. How? From behind bars? Call the cops. This is fraud, you hear me?! - But Ling Ling was different. - You got us a wimpy gorilla! Crutches? Call the cops! He looked everywhere for his master Wei Wei. And he discovered Wei Wei barely alive under a massive building frame. Hey, Sung Choong-su! Do you see that? Put that animal in the game, before the cops get here. Do you understand? It's like a father protecting his child. Here's the blank check. You started this, so end it! - You greedy piece of trash! - Miraculously, she came to life. Abandoned by the rescue team, Wei Wei cheats death with the help of an animal. Ling Ling, get up! Ling Ling! Get up right now! Get up, please! You've never disappointed me before! Can you hear me? Ling Ling! Get up! Ling Ling! Get up! Ling Ling! Ling Ling! You can do it! Get up! Wait! Save it for the police. Ling Ling, get up! Ling Ling! Ling Ling, get up! Look how incredibly powerful his arm is. Zeros is enjoying the show. He could care less about his teammates. That's a mountain gorilla. Wei Wei, change of plan. Take Ling Ling and go back to China. Remember that doctor? He'll help you leave the country. I'll get him to arrange your trip back. You need $1 million, right? Here's $1 million. Pay back your debt with this and wait for me there. I don't want to. Remember what you said? Why you liked baseball? Home to home. You start at home and return home. Now you two can return home. - And you? - Me? I'll make a short detour to jail. One year should do. I'll take care of everything and come visit you in China. Until then, run your circus. Circus of the Sun. Run it and wait for me. Those people will try to hurt you! Come on, don't cry for me. Do you remember my nickname? Bounty hunter! That's right. A human bounty hunter. Ever seen a bounty hunter gets hunted? Yeah... Look, will there be pinch hitter? Coach Kim is on the field. Mr. Go! Mr. Go! Mr. Go is coming out! Mr. Go! Everyone! A gorilla on the mound and another at bat. You're witnessing KBO's history in the making! NC Dinos's coach Park! He's signaling the fielders to move back. Good choice. Ling Ling, get ready! - Leiting! - Throw! Throw! Very good! Great job! Leiting! My baby! His right leg injury must be quite serious. It's heartbreaking. It's okay, just get back up! Yes! Just like that! His backswing has to be half a beat faster. And the full swing too! He can't continue like this. Mr. Go falls prey to Zeros's powerful pitch. His brace is torn apart. It's busted. He's in an impossible situation. He can't put any weight on his right leg. Mr. Go looks to be in pain. He can barely stand up. He's heading back to the dugout. Mr. Go is giving up. He's leaving the plate. I can't look at this. Yes, he just can't do it. He can't even stand up. That's Doosan's last hope crumbling. Mr. Go is heading back... Wait, is he switching sides? Look, he's switching his batting stance. That's incredible! He can't use his right leg as a center of gravity. So he's shifting his weight to the left leg! How could an animal think of it? This is a true display of an animal instinct! Unbelievable! But from the left side, how will he see Wei Wei's signal? You're right. He can't see her whip signal. She didn't instruct him to switch sides either. So you're saying, Mr. Go made that decision himself? No, he couldn't have consciously made that decision, Wei Wei must've trained him for this kind of situation. With enough repetition. What? That's the only explanation. How could an animal think on his own? It's all due to Wei Wei's training! She taught him to communicate too! Wei Wei must've trained him for this kind of situation. Animals can be trained through repetitive training... Leiting, throw! Mr. Go's powerful swing shattered the ball on impact! The ball is in thousand pieces! How do you explain this? Is it a foul?! In the official rule book, this kind of situation... I've never seen this before. What? I've never seen a ball explode. Let's check the rules. All the pieces of the ball are inside the diamond. NC has to pick up the pieces. And with that... Collect them, then... Run! Wei Wei, run! Run! Run! Pick them up! Just run! Pick them up! Ling Ling! Run! Run! Run! - Just run! - Run! - Just run! - Run! Get all the pieces! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! I don't think Mr. Go made it in time. It looked out from here. Mr. Go's hand is above the glove. He was automatically tagged. The umpire is about to call... Why isn't he making the call? Indeed, Mr. Go reached the plate too late. Did the umpire see something? He's walking toward it. It's a piece of the ball! A leather piece! NC left behind a big piece! It's too big a piece to ignore! Safe! Safe! The Doosan Bears take the game and win the Division Finals! In a major dramatic turnaround, Mr. Go and Doosan take the win! (DOOSAN GOES TO THE KOREAN SERIES) The Doosan Bears take the game 7-6, and move up to the championship! Get up, Ling Ling! Ling Ling! Can you hear me? Ling Ling! Ling Ling! I'm not calling the cops, no way! Get the ambulance! What an incredible play! Amazing! That was unbelievable! Look! It's okay! It's okay! Calm down everyone. Love and concern... Leiting! Wei Wei, get away! Get away! Leiting, stop it! Ling Ling! Wei Wei, get in! Wei Wei! What about Ling Ling?! Hurry! Hurry! Get in! Ling Ling! Hurry! Get away! Move! Get away! Mr. Sung! Wake up! Mr. Sung! Ling Ling, stop it! That's enough! - Please stop! - Don't. It's all my fault. So... Please stop. Please stop. It's not Leiting's fault. It's all my fault. Please stop. What did I do? Please void the contract. Good bye, so long. Call the cops! Agent Sung Choong-su is being investigated for fraud. In the aftermath of the gorilla rampage scandal, KBO has suffered a major blow to its reputation. Hiroshi has denied all rumors of possible acquisitions. Wait! Korean baseball has a bright future! And Zeros will never be signed. Lin was deported on suspicion of illegal money lending charges. I really don't understand! What did I do wrong! Mr. Go, who is banned permanently from KBO, has successfully completed... There was an incident during the operation when the anesthesia wore off, but we finished it with our sweat and passion. Doosan Bears miraculously wins the Korean Series! They became an unavoidable force even without Mr. Go. Former pro-baseball agent Sung Choong-su was released today after four months. His release was made possible by the Doosan Bears's request to drop charges. Mr. Sung's KBO agent license was revoked permanently. He left the scene hastily without any comments. Meal time! - Let's eat! - Let's eat! Line up, don't push. (THE KOREAN GOVERNMENT SHOULD SEND LEITING BACK!) Don't be picky and eat plenty. Winter melon's good for you. Wei Wei, look. Don't steal! Stop! Stop! Don't you dare steal the food! The bounty hunter... (A Kim Yong Hwa Fim) (Mr. Go Ling Ling) (Sung Dong-il Xu Jiao) (6 MONTHS LATER) (SEOUL ZOO) Very good! Very good! Very nice! Leiting! Leiting! My baby!
