These two apiarists were talking to one another, and one bloke said to the other, he said, "How's your bee business going?" And he said, "Oh, yeah, it's going on quite nicely." And the other fella said, "How many bees do you reckon you'd have?" And he said, "Oh, roughly 250,000, 300,000." He said, "Oh, that's a good number." He said, "What about the hives?" He said, "Well, I've just put in another one," he said, "so that makes it seven." He said, "Oh, that's great." The other fella said, "What about you?" And he said, "Well, as you know," he said, "I've been doing it for a long time, "and Dad was an apiarist before me." And he said, "At the last count, "I reckon I've got about 2.5 million to 3 million bees." He said, "3 million?!" the other bloke said, and he said, "Yeah." He said, "How many hives you got?" He said, "Oh, just the one." He said, "3 million bees and just the one hive?" He said, "Yeah. Yeah. "Fuck 'em." Now, what's this party all about anyhow, son? Oh, it's just a party, Dad. Yeah, I'm told they're gonna bring some jokes along. Is that right? Yeah, that's right. Yeah, well, I've got a couple of jokes. Yeah, I know you do, Dad. Yeah. There's this bloke and his missus and 14 kids, and they're standing at a bus stop. They've got a blind bloke with them. The bus pulls up and the 14 kids get on and the woman gets on and the husband goes to get on and the bus driver said, "Hey. Whoa. Stop. "Too many on the bus. You're gonna have to walk." So he's left with the blind bloke. And the blind bloke said, "Do you mind if I walk with you, mate?" And he said, "Oh, no. Nothing else can go right. "You may as well walk with me." And as the blind bloke's going along, he's tapping the ground with his cane, and the fella said, "Must you tap that bloody thing on the ground? "It's driving me mad." And he said, "Well, I'm a blind man. "It's the way I find my way along." And he said, "Well, yeah. "Couldn't you put some rubber on your stick?" The blind man said, "If you'd have put some rubber on YOUR stick, "we'd have both got on the fuckin' bus." Remember the first limerick you told me, when I was about eight? "Mary had a little dress with a slit right up one side. "Every time she bent over, the boys could see her thighs. "Mary had another dress, with a slit right up the front. "She didn't wear that much." You weren't eight. He was fuckin' seven. So, the invite said don't bring food and don't bring booze - just bring your three favourite jokes.

First time in their marital home together, and he goes up to the bathroom, and he comes down and he says, "There's a dead horse in the bath." And she says, "Well, I never said I was neat."

This guy goes to a supermarket, right, and he gets up to the checkout line. Gets a half a loaf of bread, half a pint of milk and half a dozen eggs, and a Playboy magazine.

A pie walks into a bar and the barman says, "Sorry, we don't serve food here." So, there's this elderly couple. They're driving home, and this cop pulls them over, see? Puts down his window, and goes around and the cop says to the bloke, "Were you aware that you're doing 80 in a 60 zone?" And the wife says, "What'd he say?" He says, "He says I was doing 80 in a 60 zone." Says, "Can I have your licence, please?" "What did he say?" He said, "He wants to see my licence." So the cop looks at the licence and says, "Oh, you're from Ballarat. He says, "Christ, I had the worst sex in my life "in Ballarat." She says, "What did he say?" He says, "He thinks he knows you." Dad, did I tell you about the blonde girl that walks into a library and said, "Can I have a hamburger, please?" He said, "Darling, this is a library." She said, "Oh, I am sorry."

So, he knows there's a mechanic's around the corner and he pushes his car to the mechanic's and says, "Could you find out... I don't know what's happened. "It's just conked out. I don't know what's going on." The mechanic's like, "I'm a bit busy. "If you can go for a walk for half an hour, come back, "I'll have a look and let you know what's going on." So the penguin takes himself for a little waddle. Gets down by the water, paddles about in the sun. Looks at his watch - it's almost been half an hour. Makes his way back to the mechanic's and gets himself a nice little vanilla ice-cream on the walk. He's having a lovely time. This is the whole point of the trip. And he gets back and the mechanic's having a look under his bonnet, and the penguin rocks up and says to him, "Oh, so what's wrong with my car? What's going on?"

Well, there's a pub in Sydney called the Harbour View, and it's a wharfies' pub, and there's a regular group that hits there Friday nights. I used to too sometimes. Anyway, there's a guy - Tommy was his name. He was a wharfie, and he was a regular, and he just suddenly stopped coming in, you know? Sort of talked about him for a while, and about six months later, he turns up in a Ferrari. A brand-spanking-new Ferrari. And strolls into the pub, done up like, you know, a million dollars. Struttin' diamonds and all sorts of things. So, I say, "What...what the hell happened, Tommy? He said, "You wouldn't believe this." He said, "I bought one of them sheds," he said, "that you buy for...prefabricated." He said, "You know, about 120 bucks." He said, "I put it up in the backyard. "And I spend a bit of time in it, in my tool shed, "so I put a window in it." He said, "I put this vinyl stuff," he said, "It's like off a caravan." "But I put the window in it," and he said, "My neighbour next door looked over "and saw the shed and he said, 'That's a beauty,' he said. "'Where'd you get it?' "And I said, you know, 'I put it together myself.'" "And he said, 'I'd love to have a shed like that.' "He said, 'How much do you want for it?' "And I...I didn't want to sell it, you know? "120...Cost me about 150." "And he said, 'Oh, you know, 300 bucks.' "And he said, 'Sold.'" And he grabs the shed off him for 300 bucks, you know? And thought, "Oh, good." "So I went and bought another bigger, better shed "and I put two windows in it, you know? "And I sort of...and the...

And he has a few drinks and gets enough courage and makes his way over, right? This is my hunchback impersonation. It's terrible. - Taps her on the shoulder. - "'Scuse me?!" "Can I...? Can I take you for a dance?" And she's like, "Oh! Oh, um, yep. "Uh, yes! I'd love to dance! Lovely!" So, they dance throughout... And he's a really good dancer. Like, he's doing the worm, the full bit. And he says, "Can I get you a drink? I can make you a drink?" And she's like, "That would be lovely." She can barely see this guy but she's like, "Yeah, great. Sounds great." He makes her a drink. The night progresses. He's made her many drinks, they've had many dances, and he's had a few drinks himself and thinks, "Alright, I'm gonna...see if I can... "I think I might be in here." So, he goes, "Would you consider coming home with me?" And she's like... She's a bit tanked, so she's like, "Well... Yeah, alright. "That sounds kind of fun. Great. Yeah." And, so, he wanders out the front and there's a hansom cab waiting, naturally, and he gets over to the hansom cab and, um... ..tries to blow out the candle. And "Sss! Sss!" Blows out the candles, so she can't... 'Cause he's very conscious, if she sees him, she's not gonna come home. So, they get in the hansom cab, get back to Notre Dame. She's like, "Oh, this is enormous! Is this your place?" He's like, "Yeah, it's not bad!" "I'm very sorry about all the stairs." She's like, "Oh, no, that's OK." So, they go up the stairs and as they're going up the stairs, he's... .. trying to blow out the candles... "Sss! Sss!" Doing all the candles on the way up. They get to the top - the view's spectacular. She's like, "This is amazing." He's like, "Yeah, it's not bad. "Would you consider having sex with me?" And she's pretty tanked and she's looking at the view, she's in a great pad, and she's like, "Yeah, OK. Why not? "Yeah, alright. Sounds good." And, so, they go to bed and they have really great sex. Great...great sex. All night. And they fall asleep in each other's arms. It's beautiful, very romantic. The next morning, the sun is coming through the window and she is awoken by the sunlight and sort of sits up and looks across and discovers the hunchback and what she's spent the evening with... ..and... She vomits everywhere. Everywhere. All over the doona, the pillow, everywhere. She's vomited everywhere. He, of course, wakes up to the sound of this woman vomiting, turns over and goes, "Oh... "Are you alright?" And she says, "Oh..." She's very polite. "Oh, yes. I'm so sorry. "I had a lot to drink. The...the altitude... "I've just...I've just thrown up everywhere. "I'm so sorry.

And he's kind of used to this happening and he kind of thought, "Oh, it's happened again." And down the end of the bar, there's another lady waiting and he's noticed she's been there for about the same time. In the end, he's said, "Can I buy the lady there a drink? "I don't want to chat her up or anything. "It's just if she's going through what I am, "I know what it feels like," and just say, "'From a man at the other end of the bar. Nothing in it.'" So, he buys her a drink and the barman explains to her, "It's from the guy at the end of the bar." And he doesn't go to her. Another hour goes past. And she thinks, "God, he meant that." Anyway, and they get chatting and she kind of thinks, "This is a nice guy." So, she ends up drinking too much and she says, "Gosh, I was supposed to drive home. "I was only gonna have a couple." And he says, "If you want, I live just round the corner." "You're more than welcome to stay the night." So, he says, "Look, I'm gonna be gone "pretty early in the morning. "You can stay in my room. I'm gonna sleep on the couch." And she thinks, "This is a bit of a con." But sure enough, he's putting a doona on the couch and, so, he leads her into the room, opens the room, and it's this beautiful room, everything's neat as you could ever imagine. He goes back and just gets on the couch and puts the doona over. And she's sitting there, thinking, "Is this a con?" Nup. Time goes by, she looks in the room and not only is it perfect, but he's got all these shelves and he's got, like, teddy bears and they're arranged. Everything is so neat. They're arranged. Like, the biggest teddies on the top and medium-sized one on the middle and little ones down the bottom. And she's like, "Oh, my God, this is the nicest guy..." She said, "I'm just gonna go and ask him "if he'd like to stay in the room with me." So, "If you would like to have sex, "I think you're the right sort of person I should do it with." Well, to her surprise, it goes for an hour and a half. It is the best sex she has ever had in her life, and she is exhausted. At the end, she's collapsed. She's sweated all she can sweat. There's no more swear words. She cannot lay her tongue to another swear word. It's been so amazing. And she goes, "Oh! That was amazing!" "How good was that?!" And he said, "Yeah, yeah, it was pretty good. "Anything from the bottom shelf." A bit of a carny joke there.
