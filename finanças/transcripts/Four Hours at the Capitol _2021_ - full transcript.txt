Officer Michael Fanone: January 6th started off pretty much like any other day for me. Got up, got a workout in. Rep. Madison Cawthorn (on radio): Go and fight in Washington D.C.! I'll tell you, and at 12:00 today, we will be contesting the election! Fanone: But it, it wasn't until I started listening to the speeches that were given at that rally on the 6th, that I felt that, uh, that day was gonna be a bad day. Donald Trump Jr. (on radio): These guys better fight for Trump because if they're not, guess what? Rudy Giuliani (on radio): Let's have trial by combat! Fanone: And I could tell, that today might be a problem. I've been a police officer now for almost two decades, and that day, to think that I, and a shit ton of my fellow officers almost lost their lives, pisses me the fuck off. (somber music playing) (indistinct chatter) Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Hold on, let me turn it around, Drew. All right, let's hope my WiFi stays up this time, guys. I got up very early on the 6th. I was trying to get in where President Trump was, uh, but the line was, probably, 50,000 people in line trying to get in. Oh, they're not lettin' anybody in anymore. It's full packed already. And I saw some friends of mine, and... they said, "Hey, uh, let's go to the Washington Monument." So I went to the Washington Monument, and that's where I saw a lot of people that I noticed, and knew who they were. (indistinct shouting) Proud Boys (chanting): Fuck Antifa... Eddie Block: Everybody knows me as a Proud Boy, but that's 'cause I'm the crippled guy on the scooter who films everything.

We're like brothers. We vet people. We wanna make sure we get the best of the best. And I'm not talkin' about physical-wise 'cause, I mean, look at me. We're talkin' about just people with the values that we have. You know, you don't beat up women, you, you don't go against, you know, the United States, stuff like that. Everybody just started marching down the grass towards the Capitol. Let's go! (indistinct chatter) Block: I'm goin' live. Mask up! Share this video, guys. You're walkin' with the Proud Boys to the State Capitol. They felt that the election was stolen. They felt that their vote was taken away from 'em, and they felt this was the only way to get their voices heard. Crazy cripple comin' through! It, it looks like soldiers 'cause we are soldiers. - Ready? Let's roll! - We're good. - Block: Whose streets? - Crowd: Our streets! - Whose streets? - Our streets! Rep. Buddy Carter: You know, I, I wouldn't say it was a normal day. We knew that it... Of course, we would be voting on election certification. You know, they were moving toward the Capitol. You know, this is America, and they have every right to do that. To rally and, and to protest. Block: Share this video, guys. You're rollin' with the Proud Boys. Nobody else is live, but Eddie Block with the Proud Boys. Protester (shouts): Do your job! Rep. Jim McGovern: That morning, I, I showed up to work pretty early. I could hear people chanting. I opened the... door, went out to the balcony, and I could see them, uh, from a distance. It just never occurred to me that a mob would get into the Capitol Building. Block: They can smell the testosterone comin' towards 'em. Leah Han: I am a staff assistant with the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. I just came very early. I'm the one who usually opens up the office, so it didn't seem too different that day. Ethan Nordean: We're goin' this way. You can adjust accordingly. We're turning... turning right. (dramatic music plays) (cheers and applause) Tayler Hansen: You know, right as I got there, the energy was just through the roof. It was seriously something I have never seen before. I have never seen that many people in one area for the support of one president, or one thing. I mean, it was amazing. President Donald Trump: We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn't happen. - You don't concede when there's theft involved. - (cheering) Now it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy. And after this, we're gonna walk down, and I'll be there with you, to the Capitol. (cheering) Hansen: He told all of us to be out there, and everyone was just listening, and we all know with Trump supporters, I mean, they admire this man. This man is... It's... He's their, he's their savior, essentially. Other than, you know, our Lord Jesus Christ. President Trump: Because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong. (cheering And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not gonna have a country anymore. Ashley Gilbertson: I turn up at this rally. You know, when Trump was speaking, it was blind devotion. Crowd (chanting): Trump! Trump! Trump!

You know, these are smart people that know better. They know the truth. And if nobody is challenging that narrative, you can't expect the people that we're supposed to lead, if they don't hear that the election wasn't stolen, you can't expect 'em to believe that. (yelling) Rep. McGovern: A lot of those people that showed up at the Capitol that day, it's frightening to think that there are people out there who, who believe crazy stuff. But we have to figure out how to deal with that. You know? How, how do we help people understand the difference between fact and fiction, between the truth and conspiracy theories. (yelling) Griffin: Trump, in regards to election fraud, you know, he said, "They cheated, they cheated, they cheated, they cheated." And then once it came right down to it, all of a sudden, he was gone. (mischievous music playing) But at the very end of Trump's presidency, the only ones that are locked up are those that stood by him the strongest. On January 17th, I'm arrested. They put me in jail for nine days without even lettin' me come out to take a shower. I'm a firm believer in capital punishment, and I'm a firm believer in hard labor, but to lock someone in a cell for nine days, and not even let him take a shower. It's un-American and it's inhumane, and it should've never happened. If I was the one sittin' on his side of the desk on that show called "Apprentice" and I had Donald Trump sittin' in front of me, I'd probably say, "You're fired, Mr. President." ♪ ♪ Block: So I was back in California. There was just a huge pound on my door. - (banging) - Police! I have a brand-new St. Bernard puppy named Donald J. Trump, and so I'm like, "Hold on, let me make sure my dogs are secure." FBI Agent: All right, hands where we can see 'em, all right? Block: They told me they were lookin' for information on the Proud Boys, basically. FBI Agent: Does your dog bite? Okay! Block: And they said, "We're taking every piece of electronics you have in your house." But you name it, they took it. McGinniss: What, what strain is that? What strain of weed is that? Alvear: That video went viral. 6.7 million views on Twitter, and it basically got me in trouble because family ended up seeing it, and they ratted me out to the FBI. So, this is the "Make America Great Again" hat. And is now, because I won't wash it, stained with sweat, tear gas. It, it wasn't an insurrection, it wasn't an attempted takeover of, of anything. But it did show, very clearly for the world to see, that there's a large, large group of American citizens who value their vote, their voice, and this country enough to walk up and knock on your door and... and walk through it. (somber music playing) President Trump: Uh, it was, uh, zero threat. Right from the start, it was zero threat. Some of 'em went in, and they're, they're hugging and kissing the police and the guards, you know, they, they had great relationships. Fanone: I had, what would amount to, like a mild heart attack. I also learned that I experienced a, you know, traumatic brain injury. What I most struggle with is, you know, kind of, some of the emotional after-effects, or psychological trauma. And it certainly doesn't help when, you know, elected leaders won't even acknowledge that it occurred. I still haven't made sense of it. ♪ ♪ Sandra Garza: Brian was a United States Capitol Police Officer. (laughter on videotape) We'd spent, you know, a little over 11 years together. Brian was assaulted on January 6th, and then he was on a ventilator. Um, on the 7th, his heart stopped. That was one of the most painful moments of my life, knowing that, that he was gone, that he was not coming back. The number one person I want to see held accountable is Donald Trump. And then, all of the people that enabled him. They all have blood on their hands. It's not just Donald Trump. It's all of them. Not just the people that died that day, but all the suicides that occurred after. It's not right. It's not right. ♪ ♪ Erin O'Reilly Smith: When he came home after that day, Jeff became a completely different person. He wasn't sleeping, he wasn't eating. Um, there was obviously something that happened that changed him. An MPD officer showed up at my door with the news. Jeff had used his service weapon... to take his own life. Um, it was his MPD-issued firearm. He was off from, basically, the 7th until he returned on the 15th. Um, when he left on the 15th, I kissed him, told him I loved him, and told him I'd see him when he came home. And he did not come home. ♪ ♪
