Subtitles by explosiveskull - Alright. - Thank you so much. You are sexy. - Thanks. - Shh, don't, don't talk, just stay sexy. I, I have your number. Alright, be good. Mom? Dad? Dad, please. Please. Please, no. It says here you went to the New York School of Law. It's on Long Island. I know where it is. And you passed the bar last spring. Yes, I did. Finally. Thank, God. I doubt God has anything to with it. What have you been doing since? Picking up cases independently. Um, getting some good experience. Staying on my feet while I look to secure my dream job. Hmm. Look, let me be straight with you. You survived law school. You passed the bar, no small feat. I am an extremely hard worker. So our the grads from Harvard, Princeton, and Yale. Miss Sacks, I am well aware that I don't have the pedigree of an Ivy Leaguer, but here's what I can tell you about me. You will not find anyone who works harder, who is more determined, who brings a kind of energy and passion and determination and inspiration that I bring to this game. I love this work. I breathe it, I eat it for breakfast. And I understand your perception of me. You had it as soon as I walked in the door. But now it's my job to convince you otherwise because that is what I do. It is what I do. It is what I'm good at. It is what God put me on this earth to do, ma'am, and... I'm sorry. I understand, it's... Have some. Thank you. Next. Dammit. What the fuck? It's not the lock. What, you did this? No, you did. Oh, no, no, no. You have to let me in. Let me guess, you have a big case that's about to close? You know, yeah, actually. And when you win it, you're gonna pay me the $3,000.00 for the last two months rent? Yeah, that's what you, that's what you want, huh? Come up with $3,000.00 to pay rent by the end of the month. - Listen to me. - Or your stuff's going on the street or to Goodwill. You can't do this. 30 days notice, that's the law. Oh, you really are a shitty lawyer. I gave you notice a month ago. Lisa. You need to come home. Okay, good talking with you too. Aaron, listen to me. - Lisa... - Your dad died. Aaron? Uh... Aaron? Paddington. Come here, boy. Well, I see you never trained the mutt. Relax, boy. I'm just trying to help your mom around the house now that your dad's gone. Yeah, that's fine, Yates, just control the dog, please. You may be a big shot, big city lawyer. That don't mean you can forget where you came from. How can I forget? Mom? What the? Hello? Hey, Mom. You're here. Yeah, of course I'm here. So glad you could make it. You're skinny. I'll fix you something to eat. Sorry about the cereal and the no milk. No time for shopping this week. Lisa usually takes me but with all that happened... Mom, it's fine. This is, this is great, thank you. I used to cook the most beautiful dinners for your father. He loved his food. You know, I could pack on a few, so maybe we can go to the store a little later and you can plump me up like dad? That's not funny. Look Mom, do you wanna talk about it? Not really. There's no need. You know everything you need to know. He's dead. He was proud of you. A budding young lawyer. The last couple of weeks, he talked about you all the time. About how when you were younger you would go antiquing, and you would find these beautiful pieces to take and sell in the shop. You were also always getting into a little bit of trouble. I ran out of Band-Aids. Mom, I'm so sorry I wasn't here. Well, life has a way of getting in the way of life, doesn't it? You still should have called me. I did. You finished with your cereal? - Right. - But, but, the main component is the comfort. - Hmm, I enjoy... - Having the room, the leg room in back and you can sleep in... And also... Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. Oh, wow, all this stuff from my dad's shop. I know, I'm the one who helped your mom move it here. Okay, I know, I probably should have been around more. No, we all know how busy you are. - Still... - But then again, you've always been too busy for everything and everyone. Mom, I'm, I'm so sorry. Everybody's asking about you downstairs. They wanna see you. Oh, I can't. It's okay, don't worry. I, I'll take care of it, okay? I got it, you just, I got it. Thank you. Hmm. Today's the big day, huh? How'd you know? Effective advertising. Hey, whatever brings 'em in, right? Where's your mom? Don't ask. Giver her some time. So where's your other half? So you've heard, huh? Nope, I didn't hear shit. But I know you couldn't stay single too long. He's working. It's Derek. Derek, like douchebag Derek? He's changed. He's the sheriff now. Prodigal son returns. You should be happy - for me. - Oh, shit, what's up, Ty? Mm, what's up, Ty? - How's it been goin'? - Been doin' alright. I've gotta get going. - Yeah. - Aren't you gonna buy - anything? - Nope. What was that about, man? Her boyfriend and I got a bit of history. History, what kind of history? No, nothing like that, man. I've been sober for three years straight. Oh. You know how it is with all this small town shit, man. You're back? Yeah, not long, you know, I just, I just wanna help Mom get back on her feet. Yeah, she needs you. She told me that you're trying to make partner at the firm. Aaron? What do you think you're doing? Oh, shit. Alright man, so, you gotta, see you gotta figure something out, so I'm gonna holler at you later, alright? - Okay. - Alright. What is all this? Put that down. - Mom. - Put, put that down. - Mom, mom, come here. - Put that down. Come here, come here. Look, I'm just clearing out some of the clutter. Okay, that's all. This is your father's life's work. He, he cherished each and every one of these pieces. I know, I know, but... - But what? - Come, come on, Dad's... Don't you dare say it. Don't you dare. Okay, I'm sorry. - Look, I just thought... - No, no, no, that's the problem is that you don't think. If you had thought, you wouldn't come breezing in here after all these years and start selling off your father's things. Mom, come on, that's not fair. - Oh. - I'm, I'm trying to - help here. - Oh, now you're trying to help. Oh, that's very nice of you. You would go months without even checking in on us. Not even a phone call. And, oh, heaven forbid that you would drive down and spend a weekend with us while your father was dying. I will be goddamned if I'm gonna let you sell the last memories I have of him. How dare you? I want this back in my house now. Just the way you found it. What are you looking at? Look at me. You're the clutter. I would have tripped over you if you had been here. Fuck. What the fuck? Goddamn it. 3,000, that's, that's all I want. Hello? Oh. Hey, Jeremy. You've been in town, you don't call, - Shh. - you don't text. Too cool for your old best friend, I get it. I know, I'm dick. - Give it to me. - You are a dick. I'm just fucking with ya. It's good see ya, man. It really is, I missed you. We, we got a lot of catching up to do. Alright, so here's the thing. Hmm? Rumors of my success have been slightly exaggerated. Oh, what the fuck you talking about, dude? I currently work in a fucking coffee shop. Holy shit. That blows, man, I'm sorry. Yeah, I just can't land with a good firm with the shitty law school I went to. Yeah, but fuck all of those rich assholes, man. You're better than them. Just keep a stiff upper lip. Oh, oh shit, I'm sorry, man. That's, hey, ah, what's with that ugly urn over there? It's a goddamn eye sore. It looks kind of disco-ee. Just belonged to my dad, I don't know. It's kind of creepy. You know that, right? It gives off some spooky vibes. I mean, shut up, let's grab a drink. - Yeah, let's go. - Let's go, c'mon. Here's your two beers. Hey, so ah, you seen Lisa yet? Yeah, I've seen here a couple of times. Couple of times, Christ. Mm-mm, mm-mm, no, not like that, man, you know. We're just friends. Barely. Look, I don't wanna bring anything serious up, but Derek, Derek's not good people. He's really, really bad to her. If you know what I mean. No, what do you mean? I mean, Lisa's been wearing a lot of foundation lately. He, he hits her? That son of a bitch. And he's a cop, so he can get away with it. Alright, I'm gonna take a leak. Hey, can I help you. Could I get a coffee to go? Yeah, sure. The legal eagle has landed. - Seat's taken. - I don't see anybody. You never did, did you, Derek? Well, I see Lisa, actually. I see a lot of Lisa. And tonight, when she's very comfortably sitting on my mustache and begging me to guess her weight, I'll tell her you said hello. Got to admit, you do look good in uniform. Just like your daddy. And your, your daddy did that, right? Thank you, yeah, it runs in our blood. I just hope you didn't inherit the get drunk and beat the shit out of your wife gene. You weren't worth the effort in high school, and you sure as shit ain't worth it now. Coffee to go. Good talk. Welcome home. Check, please. It's getting pretty thick out there tonight. Oh. Yeah, in Chicago it gets worse than this. Let's do a Lucky Seven, too. How much? Ah, 14.95. - There you go. - Thanks. Better luck next time. Alright, thanks. Jesus. Pack of smokes. You know what? Fuck it, let's do another one. Alright, thanks. Dude. Did... You just won $5,000.00, man. Woo, fuck. Aaron? - Aaron, just a minute, please. - Yeah, yeah? I wanna apologize. I did not mean to blow up like that but things have been hard, and I miss your father. And now I'm going to lose you again. Mom, come on, you're not losing me. I gotta go back to Chicago. That's where I live, that's where my life is. Aaron, stay. Just for a few more days. It would mean so much to me. Please. Okay. Um, okay, but just a few more days, Mom. That's all I can do, okay? Understood. - Alright. - Thank you. Come on. Hey, Paddington, I wish you would just shut up. Okay, okay, okay, hold on. What the fuck? Okay, what, what is the problem now? You know goddamn well what the problem is. No, actually I don't. Get out here. Come on. Go on, Yates. How could you do this? Can't you, you think I did this? Don't lie to me. You always hated him. No. This ain't over, boy. Look, I'm sorry, but I didn't do this. Well then who did? Fuck. Fuck, I would never kill a dog. It's insane. I don't know what happened. So, I ran into Derek the other night. He's as charming as ever. Alright, Aaron, he's good to me, okay? Really? Is that right? 'Cause that's not what I heard. From who? Tyrone? Does it matter really? Yeah. Look, I know it's probably none of my business at this point, but the Lisa I knew never would have put up with that shit. Yeah, you're right. It really is none of your business. I get it. I leave, you think you're making this big upgrade. The high school quarterback. Voted best looking in the yearbook. You probably always wanted to be with him. You know, but he's still a jerk. Everybody knows it. Are you done? Don't, don't you think I wish I could be more like that sometimes? I mean, just, just the town brute that everybody, all the girls love for some fucking reason that I can't seem to figure out. Insecurity and jealousy. That's, that's you in a nutshell. Like, I need to get these groceries back to your mom. If you're gonna be a jerk, you can just walk. Just lookin' out. Yeah, thanks. I wish I was better looking. Fifty-five hundred, up as well. That's 2,924 with a consumer confidence all suggesting general confidence about the state of the economy, which comes as good news for Wythe administration, which has been feeling the pressure to deliver on its campaign promise of 20% overall gain in the economy in the first 12 months. What happened? I'd say you're a lucky man. It could have been much worse. We did have to perform a minor facial reconstruction procedure. - What? - Which despite the seriousness of the accident, - Wait, slow... - I think you're going to be pleasantly surprised. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I couldn't, I couldn't see and... Look, I know this isn't your fault, okay? It was an accident. That's all, I needed to hear that. Thank you so much. Oh, fuck. - We'll be okay. - It's not okay. Derek arrested me that night. Said I was drunk driving but I'm sober. They said I blew a .3. Do you know he's the one that got me fired from the force? For drinking on the job, but I owned up to that. Fact is, he has it out for me ever since I went out with Lisa a couple of times. Huh? Nothing happened. She just needed someone to talk to. Look out for Derek, man. I don't know what the guy's capable of. You don't think you should slow down there a little bit, darling? Okay. You know, I forgave you for what happened under two conditions, you never lay another hand on me, and you never tell anyone. I've kept those promises. Then how come Aaron knows? Oh, that son of a bitch. That's what he was talking about the other night. So you did talk to him? I wasn't talking about us. I haven't said a single word to anyone. I could lose my fucking job, Lisa. What about you? Maybe when you were dating Tyrone? I was upset. He promised not say anything to anyone. You trust that drunk over me? You know what, you're a fucking asshole. - I'm going to bed. - You trust that drunk over me? - Have a great night. - No, yeah, yeah, why don't you go maybe text someone more of our fucking business. Bitch. Leaving so soon? This is a nice surprise. I figured you needed a lift. Where's mom? She's at home resting. Yeah, how about that sheriff of yours? Hey, Mr. Hammond. Before you go, let's take off that dressing. Alright, let's do it. I've been sitting here all week. What? Is it that bad? Huh. Oh, my God, huh. Oh, my God. Mom, you home? Mom? Mom, you can't just sit here alone in a dark room all day. This is not what Dad would want for you. He'd want you to be happy. Right? I feel like I don't even know how to be happy anymore. Mom, look at me, Mom. Yep. Oh, my God. You're perfect. You're perfect. What if I told you I'm staying longer than just a few days? Maybe a lot longer. Oh. Oh. Oh, my beautiful boy. I wish your father could see you. Me too, Mom. I just wish there was something I could do to make you happy again. Mom? Hello. You okay? Of course. You sure 'cause, ah... Of course. But you're right. I need to bury the past. And I need to focus on the present and the future. That's Bobby Darin. Oh, my God. Bobby D. He's my favorite. Listen, listen, listen to him. Oh, listen to him. Listen to him. You're not listening to me! Why don't you listen to me! You never listen to me! Would like to give your mommy a twirl? Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh. Come on. - Come on. - Okay. I don't mean to interrupt. I just wanted to make sure you guys were okay. We are, we're dancing. Go, go, go. Have a good breakfast. Protein, makes you live longer. Your mom, she seems... Happy. I know, it's, it's weird. It could have been like this all the time, you know. Look, Lisa, I'm not saying I deserve you, okay. I, I don't. But you're worth more than this. You're worth more than Derek. You deserve to be happy. Look at you going down the rabbit hole, huh, lover boy? Things seem to really be looking up for you. Whatever it is you're doing, keep doing it. It's working. Fuck, you know, man, you're right. I mean, first time in maybe years, man, things are finally looking up. I tell you what would have been nice, if my best friend had come to visit me in the hospital. I hate hospitals. Hey, um, you know, I was just thinking. That urn you got, I was thinking maybe I could buy it from you? I could use a little bit of luck myself. And what would you want that old piece of junk for? You hear that? It sounds like someone's throwing a rager in the barn. I'll be right back. Aaron, it's a miracle. Your father is home. Oh. Oh. Oh. - Mom? - Oh, ho, ho. Mom? Hello. Where is it? Where's that fucking thing? Don't you talk to me like that! And don't you talk about your father like that. That wasn't Dad, that was a fucking demon, Mom. That was, that was a demon. It was a monster. What the fuck is wrong with you? What are you doing? That is your father. That's Daddy. And he's coming back. Ooh. Go to your room! Aaron. Yeah, hi, hi, Miss McKee, I'm so sorry to bother you so late like this. God, it's been years. What's going on? Ah, listen is Jeremy around. I really, I need to speak with him. Excuse me? Is he around, does he still live here? I, it's kind of urgent, so I just need to talk to him. Is this some kind of joke? No. Jeremy died a year ago. In a car accident. I told your mother, I don't know. Maybe she just, she still busy with your dad being sick. She just didn't have a chance to say anything to you. Well that's not, it's not possible. I was, I was with him. I was with him today. Right, you were with my son today. You know what, I don't know what it is that you're doing, but I need you to leave. Leave? - And you should leave. - Wait, I don't, I don't understand. I don't care. Hey, buddy. Who the fuck are you? It's your best friend, Jeremy. Jeremy's dead. Oh, busted. It's true. But you know, death is, death is just a transition. I mean, ask your dear old dad. My dad's fucking dead, and I'd like him to stay that way. Well your wish is my command. Who the fuck are you? Alright, so you really expect me to believe that some old urn did all of this? I know it sounds so, it sounds crazy but yeah, I do. I mean, just think about everything that's happened. The, there was the dog. Ah, the money. My face, my mom. These are all coincidences. Okay, um, what about me seeing my dead dad? You did say you were really high. I've been hanging out with Jeremy, who's fucking dead, all week. Alright, I wanna see this crazy urn, let's go see it. Okay, hold on. Thank you. Here. I have an idea. Colin, it's Lisa. Sorry. Aaron, why don't you come inside so that we can talk. Thank you. I'm, I'm sorry I missed your dad's memorial. I was stuck in London at an antiquities auction. He was a good man. I'm gonna miss him. So how can I help you? We, um, wanted to show you this. Oh, my God. We bought this just before your dad got sick. He never even had a chance to unpack it. Do you remember where you got it from? Yeah, from an estate sale. From an archeologist named Andrew Williams. He supposedly found it in a, um, expedition in Iraq. Do you know what it is? Well, it's similar in size and shape to many of the artifacts that come from the ancient Mesopotamia region. But the inscription, that's the crazy thing. I mean, this predates the original Bedouin people of the Middle East by millennia. God only knows how old this vessel really is. Vessel, what do you, a vessel for what? Well according to ancient lore, the ancients used to use this as part of their ritual. To bind and to cast out demons. Now in the Bible, they're called unclean spirits. In the Koran, they're called jinn. Now the countryside of Iraq is littered with these artifacts, but nobody wants to touch 'em for fear that they'll be cursed themselves. This is the 21st century. What do you mean cursed? Well let me tell you this. When Williams returned with the urn, after a few months he, uh, he went insane. Dad, please. He murdered his wife and cut out his own tongue. His daughter found him before he completely bled out. Williams survived? Where is he now? I have his, I have his daughter's number. You got lucky. Thanks, Denise. Her name is Lynette. Thank you. The universe demands balance. For every yin, there must be yang. For there to be good, there must evil. For there to be life, there must be death. What the hell's going on? I don't know. Is your mom okay? I can't hear you. Yates! Aaron, no, no. Ah, sorry about the mess. We lost most of our money in the trial. I just can't bring myself to sell it. Lynette, I'm so sorry about everything you've been through. Did you bring it? Bring what? The urn. No. I need to see it. Please. You knew what it could do? No, not at first. My dad, he told me some of his wishes were coming true but he's eccentric. I thought it was just a coincidence. But one day, I heard him make a wish. He loved my mom. But she worked a lot. So he wished that there were two of her so he could see her more. I don't give a shit if you don't believe me. Neither does the jinn. All at once is your wishes. Did you make a wish? It gets stronger with every wish. It can take any form. It can be anyone. Jeremy. The jinn. Lynette, I believe you. Can you help me? Please. I need your help before someone else dies. My father, he'll know what to do. 20 minutes. Dad? Dad? Sir, I need to talk to you. This man has the urn. He's made wishes. Please, I need you to release his hands. He needs to write. How many wishes have you made? Um, four. It's four, right? Yeah. Paddington, money, face, mom. Yeah, that's four. Are you sure? Fuck. No, I think I may have made five. Five? Yes, yeah, I brought my dad back to life, but I think, I think I wished him away. He says whatever you do, you can't make a seventh wish. What happens if I make a seventh wish? Sir, what happens if I make a seventh wish? Sir, what happens? So what's the plan? I think we gotta grab my mom and go to Chicago. Just like that? Yeah, tonight. If Lynette's right, you can't run from this thing. It's gonna follow you. I know. I know that. I just need time to think. Just promise me you won't make anymore wishes. It's not that simple, okay? I'm a fuck up, I'm gonna do it accidentally. That man cut out his own tongue so he wouldn't make a seventh wish. I know. We gotta go. We gotta go. - C'mon. - Okay. Pick two, ah, there we go. Mom? Okay, let's find mom and get the fuck outta here. The light's not working. Okay, there's matches in the living room. Do you hear that? Go home, Lisa. We need to call the police. 911, what's your emergency? Hey, buddy. You miss me? You ready to be rich and famous? Fuck you. Is that a wish? You wanna fuck? My son. Please, do it for me. You left me and your father alone for so long. Oh, be a good son. Be a good son. Make a wish. Make things right. I can't. Of course you can. This isn't real. None of this. You deserted me. And you stole my husband after I finally got him back. You selfish little prick. You always were. Show me what you really are. Die. Show me you coward! Fuck! Aaron, I think it's in your best interest to stay away from Lisa. Derek, I am really not in the fucking mood for this tonight. Hey, don't turn you back on me. Listen, asshole... Now why'd you make me do that, huh? I'm gonna have to do that to Lisa tonight, and it's gonna be your fault. Hey! I wish that you never hurt Lisa again. Okay, you wished for it. No. You're a stubborn son of a bitch. I need to talk to you about Derek. Want something to drink? No thanks. What happened? I could get in a lot of trouble for telling you this. He's going before a judge in the morning to get your bail revoked. That fucking piece of shit. Why are you telling me this right now? Where is it? What are you doing here, Tyrone? I'm not gonna ask you again. Where is it? You need to get the fuck outta my house. You looking for this? Okay, you just, you just crossed a serious line. I crossed the line? That's funny coming from you because I know what you plan on doing tomorrow. You plan on getting the judge to revoke my bail. What are you talking, are you drunk? Tyrone, why don't you put the gun down, and go check yourself into a meeting, okay? Don't put this shit back on me. I know everything. Lisa told me. She also said she's about to leave your sorry ass. Oh, she said that, she said she's gonna leave me for Aaron, or maybe she's gonna leave me for you? 'Cause how I remember, she left both of you for me. And neither one of you can deal with that. You know what, fuck you. What the hell is wrong with you? Evidence. What evidence? The evidence you said Derek was gonna use against me tomorrow. Where is it? Tyrone, just go home. Go home before you get into anymore trouble, please. Mother fucker. Oh, no! What have you done? What have you done? He was after me and I didn't have a choice. And you said he had evidence that was gonna destroy the rest of my life. Tyrone, I haven't seen you in days. Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, I made a wish. I made a wish, I'm so sorry. What did you do? I made... Oh, fuck. I didn't wish for this. I just wished that he would never hurt you again. You need to tell me what's going on. It's the fucking jinns. Okay, you two better start - making sense right now. - Don't touch... Fuck you, man. What the fuck, Tyrone? I didn't, I'm sorry. Lisa. You said you'd stay with me. Please. It's all my fault. It's all my fault. It's all my fault. I wish I had died that day. That day Tyrone hit me with his car. For the state of the economy. This is good news for the Wythe administration, which has been feeling the pressure to deliver on its campaign promise of a 20% overall gain in the economy. I know it still works and it's heavy, be careful. Thank you, so much. Enjoy it. Whoa, last customer of the day. We did pretty good. - Oh. - I'm gonna miss you. Oh, I'm gonna miss you, too. But it's all good, and we are both making fresh starts, so. Yes, you're gonna come visit me in Chicago, right? No. It's too windy, too many people. But you could come visit me in Santa Fe. I would love to. Do you have a job lined up? I'm gonna figure it out when I get there. Hmm, you're just like Aaron. Living on the edge. - No wonder you loved - Yeah. Each other. Just like Aaron. Ah, I have something for you. Oh, really? Mm-hmm. I found this in Aaron's room. So why don't you take it. It might bring you good luck. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I could use some luck. We all could. Subtitles by explosiveskull
