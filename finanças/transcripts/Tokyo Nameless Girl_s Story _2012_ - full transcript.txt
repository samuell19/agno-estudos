Prologue Prologue Prologue Kaori. Prologue I've sure kept you waiting, Tokyo. This is farewell to a town in its twilight. This will be the start of a new me. Good morning. Episode 1: In Stride Episode 1: In Stride Nozomi. Episode 1: In Stride This city runs like a hare. Giant Panda Here is something that can happen in a place like that. Do you want a band-aid? Thank you so much. Cities make you walk more than you'd expect. I guess so. There isn't a lot of walking back home. You get everywhere by car. Where is "back home"? Matsumoto. In Nagano. Oh! And... What about you? Hiroshima. Uh... A place called Kumano famous for its calligraphy brushes. Yep. He looks to be having fun. He's most likely sunbathing. Turtles do that? They do. What should it be... Let's go with Noro. That'll be his name. That's the same as mine! ["Noroma" = airhead] I'm a bit of an airhead, so people call me Noro. Right... I guess it is the same. This was the first time in the hustle and bustle of the city that I met someone on the same wavelength as me. 2 years later I've got a good feeling about this one! - Where was it? - A bank. A bank, huh? Banks themselves are nice, but it's a government job! Won't it be a tough job? - Well, at least it's stable work. - Yeah. - That's important. - Yeah. Let's go celebrate somewhere if it works out. - Yeah, we should. - I won't have much time once I start. That's true. Hey, listen to this! - I got an offer from The Tokyo Times! - Really? THE Tokyo Times? - Congratulations! - Yeah! Thank you! That's great! You deserve it! - Our news aggregirl! - What's that supposed to mean? Everyone around me is moving forward. - How did it go? - I think I'll get it. WOW! - Yeah, it's great. - She's only had one interview. One? Just one? She's running out of time! Yeah... I- And to be honest, I'm losing patience. - So introduce me to a cutie. Sure. - That's a promise! - You, too, though. - Someone from the bank. - Don't forget me! You should find a job first! Have you chosen a field? I haven't thought about it. Something stable. Kageyama Sota, Sakashita Nozomi, and Noro Selection Notification Thank you for your interest in this position. We regret to inform you that this position has been filled. I'm home. Kame-chan? Kame-chan. The two of us have lived here while life slowly passes us by. Oh, welcome home. I've been home. I was just on the roof. How was the interview? Doubt it'll work out. The interviewer's questions caught me by surprise. Oh. So, Kame-chan... What's your plan after graduation? My plan... I'll keep painting, of course. That alone won't put food on the table. I suppose. How many times have we talked about this? Hello. Oh, hello! - Hello. - Hello! Kame-chan's just taking things at his own pace. Hello there! Have a good day. I'll see you later. But... If you don't pick up the pace a little, I'll leave you behind. Sakashita-san! Sensei! Sorry, I handed in that paper late last night. I got it! It's fine. It reads like you did your research. Really?! Truly. I'm... really sorry that I sent it so late. Better than last time! I had a feeling you'd be down to the wire again. Sorry. How's the job hunt? Found anywhere good? It's... you know. You're hoping for something in publishing, right? Yeah, for now. I got a call from a friend of mine. He's an editor. He has an opening. It's pretty short notice, but would you like an interview? Absolutely! Please set that up! Okay. I'll let him know. I'll be in touch. I want to move faster! Faster! I'm home! He left it open again... Welcome home. Were you sleeping? Just a nap. I was up late last night drawing. Did you finish it? You don't usually ask me that. What about your job hunt? Well, I should get started. We have our free time and a comfy little place. Lately, though, it all feels too cramped. Naka-chan? It's been so long! Hey, Noro? Did you get my text? Text? I sent you one! Everyone's coming to Tokyo so I said we should do a mini class reunion. Oh, right! Sorry! I kept telling myself to reply, but... There she is! That's the Noro I know! Yama-pin and the rest are all coming. I got a hold of Hayase-kun, too. He's coming. What? You freeze up just hearing his name? No, no! Hello? Noro? Something was boiling over. So? "So"? Can you make it or not? Uh, well... I'll let you know! Be quick about it! As soon as you can! I have to make sure there are enough people. Bye-bye! Hayase-kun! I guess Hayase-kun and I are the tortoise and the hare. Huh? Nozomi, are you going somewhere? I told you already. I've got a class reunion. I was wondering why Paris Hilton was standing here! I haven't seen them in a while so I need to look nice. Hey! You're going to get paint on me! Sorry, sorry. Just have a good time, okay? What about you? You're going to keep painting? Yeah, pretty much. Oh. I'll... be back. Hello, are you here? Not there... where you turned right! Nevermind, I'm coming out. Noro! Over here! - Sorry! - You're finally here. I'm so sorry! - The train didn't get me to the right place! - Sooo late! How long have you been in Tokyo now? I made sure there would still be a spot for you, you know. You never change, after all. It's been so long! - This way! Hurry! - Look at those cutie pies. Oh, to be young again... You haven't been home in that long? [restaurant chains] Then you don't know the Bamiyan by our school changed into a Gust? Really? Yeah. And... There was that theater... it's gone now, too. Wait, really? No way... Forget it, just keep walking. [large chain store] Oh, and the Ito Yokado is gone, too. I had no idea! Matsumoto is changing after all... Okay, everyone, your attention! On my beautiful face, please! That's an exaggeration! Okay, attention here! Right here on this guy's wide open fly! Guys, quiet! I've got something to say! Right, so... do you know who this is? Nozomi! Sakashita Nozomi! Can she sit next to you, Hayase-kun? Yeah, no problem. So, now that Noro is here... I think we need another cheers! Got your glasses? So... Matsumoto High class 3-B. When I say "Matsumoto High", you all say "forever"! Pipe down, guys! Okay, let's do it... Matsumoto High! Forever! - Good evening. - Been a while. But, wow... Noro-chan, you're completely different. - Have I? - You have! You're way cuter without your glasses! Well, she did dress to the nines on purpose tonight! What? What do you mean? She's had a crush on you since forever, Hayase-kun! Ow! Hayase-kun What do you do these days, Sakashita? I've... been trying hard to find a job. Noro the Airhead is looking for work?! - For real? - You don't seem like you'd bother! Right! Not one tiny little bit! Why are you in a hurry? You can just leech off your parents for now! That's right! We're still only 22! What kind of work are you looking for, Sakashita? Uh... my next interview is with a publishing company. Publishing, huh... That kind of work is in trouble these days. Well, the interview is the final interview. You made it to the final interview? Sounds like you're already set! Yeah... I don't know about that. It's not exactly the biggest company. It's better that way, I think. If it were a big company, then there would be so many things going on at once. Yeah! This company doesn't seem overly high-paced. I'd be focusing on one project at time, so I thought it'd be easy enough. You've got your ducks in a row, Sakashita. Wait... Are Hayase-kun and I... really on the same wavelength right now? They haven't changed one bit. They were all a bit surprised. You don't usually come to these things. That's probably why they think coming to Tokyo is just for fun. You know... this may sound harsh, but talking with them... it feels like throwing time away. Harsh. They don't see the forest for the trees. Maybe they're just not taking life seriously... even though... they haven't even really experienced it yet. I get it. You're the one with a possible career, so when you put it that way... I get it. I don't plan to stick with just one company my whole life, though. I'm just using this one to get a foot in the door and network. I want to be in complete control within 5 years. You're moving ahead full speed as usual. What? You're making progress, too. You'll have a job next year, right? Well... but... We're moving along at different speeds. Would you like to head somewhere else? Was that the truth earlier? That you had a crush on me? Yeah. For real... you should have said something. He doesn't remember. That hurt... What? What's wrong? My shoe. Still dragging your feet... What's wrong? Hayase-kun... I'm sorry. I'm going home. Hey! Wait! You're pretty late. I was worried. I finished it. What's up? You tired? Get some sleep. You're my rock. A tortoise can never be the hare. But there are things a tortoise can see here that a hare never will. Hello! Good work today! Thanks! See you tomorrow! Episode 2: Change Episode 2: Change Saeko. Episode 2: Change Sorry, I lost signal. Got it. Okay- Alright, I'll head straight there in the morning. I worked really hard at school, and got a job at an advertising firm. It's my fourth year. My Dad, who never congratulated me for anything, congratulated me for this. Mamiya and Odate congratulated me for this. Mamiya and Odate Okay. Mamiya and Odate Yeah... good point. That, too? “Night? It's already my 8th year in Tokyo. My grandma, who worries about me living in the big city, still finds a way to send me charms from Shinshou Temple. I'm pretty good at public relations. ...I think. Nobody gives me any reason to think otherwise after I come up with something. That's enough to put me at ease. But... Is this all there is? Is this how I'm going to grow old? That sweet smell of coffee... Even without her spry voice, I'd still know who is at the door. Too funny! I'm home! Yay! ...Ya...y. No, no! Not you, Ma-kun, a friend I live with. No, not at all! She's a girl! You worry too much, you know! Kaori is the same age as me. She only works part-time. Right now, she works at a cafe in Ginza. We met some years back at a party. After that, we grew closer together and ended up living together. Okay, okay, how about on Saturday when we're together- She always has something going on. Last month, she was at a huge BBQ party. And I think she's going scuba diving in Hawaii with someone next month. Should I? No, whenever works for you is fine! Okay! It'll be on Saturday at- How does she get along with so many people? She's on a completely different level to me. Okay! Heyyyy! Guess what?! Ma-kun and I are heading to an onsen next month! Do you know Hottarakashi Onsen in Yamanashi? You get a view of Mt. Fuji from inside the onsen! Hottarakashi! That reminds me! I got some food from that old lady who comes in all the time. She was scared it would end up stuck to her teeth, so she couldn't eat it. I'll make some tea! Green tea? Roasted green tea? Saeko! Your phone! It's Tomoya! It's just a text. It can wait. Come on, Saeko! It just says he'll be here later, right? Huh? It says he can't make it! That's life, I guess. Now then. I guess I'll take a bath. I sent him a reply. Wait, are you serious?! Why would you do that? For real, don't do that... "Sae-tan"? Why "-tan"? I don't even use hearts! Why not? He's your boyfriend! - Saeko, you need to be a little more girly. - Enough. I told you that I'm working, right? I have to get this done right now. But... I'm worried you're all done with being lovey-dovey. Saeko-san! Congratulations! Saturday is your one year anniversary! Is it? Saeko, you're free that day, right? - I don't know. - That's something you should know! You need to be free! You'll make Tomoya cry. A whole year... "Bombs"... Why don't you bake a cake for him as a surprise? You could put those "bombs" in it! He'll definitely love it. You remember this, right? Okay, seriously... stop it! I'm trying to think. Don't bother me with every little thing. I'm sorry. I'm bothering you. I'm going to take a bath. I... just can't put that much effort into relationships. - Good job today. - You, too. Really”? No waaay! I'll be lonelyyy! - From Sae-tan Great work. You, too. Hey. Help me out. Unazaki-kun, come along. Sure! - Thanks. The rest is on you. - Got it. Huh? Tomoya-san? Weren't you leaving at 9 today? All done? I did plan on that, but... The boss shoved more onto your plate again, didn't he? You're much too kind. I'll stay late to help, too! Don't worry about it, Suzuki-san... weren't you leaving? It's fine. Let me help you out! You'll miss the last train, too... It's the Seibu Shinjuku Line, so... - maybe you can- - Tomoya-san. Don't worry. Let's get it done. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Sorry about this. - It's no problem! How should this be sorted? Uh... that one... should be here. - With this one. - Oh, okay. Got it! Tomoya and Saeko, thanks to me, one year anniversary! Almost a year now. I remember that at least. Hey! I wrote my name on the nameplate! - We're back! - Welcome back! I cleared out the room. Come on in! We're coming in! Thanks! Big Place! Isn't it? All this? This way! It's a lovely place! So, my room is over there. Come this way. Excuse me. That way. I met Tomoya... on the day Kaori weasled her way in here. - Thank you! - Good job, everyone! - Thanks! Great help! - Take care! How about we go to the fireworks? The yakisoba there is crazy good! Thanks so much! You were a great help! Take care! Where did you find all those characters? All over. Well, most of them I met in the spring during a Hanami party. I don't exactly know all their names yet, though. I'm drunk! Yaaay! Who is this? Anyone you know? No, I don't... Cheers! Cheers. You're unbelievable. What's wrong? I'm pooped. You were putting my bed together? Yep. Huh? Where'd they go? They went home! I'm sorry, Satoru-kun! It's Tomoya. Sorry, sorry! Tomoya-kun! Would you like some? Bombs? Can I wash my hands? Feel free. - Use this. - Okay. So, Tomoya-kun... Do you have a girlfriend? I don't. He's free, Saeko! How about someone like him? He's a bit soft, but a good guy! Why are you forcing this conversation? I'm not forcing it! You two suit each other! It's not like you're never going to date anyone, right? There you go again. Drop it. You're missing out! You're missing out on everything in life! There is so much more to life than work! And you're pretty, too, Saeko! Right? There are people who can't do something even if you tell them to. Right? It's great. Very sweet! I knew it! Fusahime! I can't believe you know that! These get sent from home a lot. You're from Chiba? Yeah, Narita. The area is well known for its strawberries. Do you know lida Farms? I do! Near Sasagawa Distillery? My parents work there. Really? That's such a coincidence! Back home, we have a habit of calling big juicy fruits like these "bombs". "Bombs"? - That's weird. - You're lying! The sweetness of it... and how juicy they are... is like an explosion in your mouth, right? Bang! It got me... That was a joke. You're laughing too much. Just finding out we're from the same place did open me up to the possibility a bit, - Have a bunch. - Sure. But if Kaori didn't play Cupid ...would we still have dated? - They're pretty sweet. - Yep. I sometimes wonder if Kaori and I switched places and I could live as freely as she does, would life be more fulfilling for me? You're smoking too much. Shut it. Good night. Maybe I should try being a bit more girly. Hello? Sorry, were you asleep? Sorry about that weird text. Kaori did that all on- Right? You could tell. So... I wanted to ask... Are you working this Saturday? No, I just happen to have the day off. Yeah. Well, we can pencil it in. Yeah. Yeah. Well, let's say 6 on Saturday, then. Yeah. Okay! Bye! Saying it is easy... but can I actually do it? "Well, I can figure something out by then." I kept saying that to myself, and... It's already that big? It's above the clouds! Time really does fly. It's already "then". Time certainly does fly. Right! Step 1: Go shopping! Well, then! A failure! Try again! I have enough, right? This time... Dammit! It's done! I did it... Yay! I even had some "bombs" sent over to top the cake off! If we're doing it, we're doing it with a bang! This is looking great! So nice! Coming, coming... Stuck at work... sorry. - Tomoya Bang! Jerk! Jerk! Jerk! Jerk! Jerk! I'm home! Sorry for dropping in. I'll leave right after I change! He's not here. Why not? Work got in his way, he says. For real? That's unbelievable. This is your anniversary! He can't help it. I can't let that one go! You've reached voicemail. When you are done recording your message, either hang up or press pound. Hello? Tomoya? It's Kaori. You have plans with Saeko and you're still at work? When you hear this, call Saeko- Huh? Hello? Wait! Don't just go and do whatever you want! Sorry, Tomoya. I don't mind one bit! If this is important, I can take a message for Tomoya. No. It's... not that important. I'm going to hang up, then. We're busy here. Well, I guess he's busy. That's settled. Um... It's fine, don't worry. You should get going. Is that a date outfit? It's really nice! Saeko... I told you that I'm fine. Ma-kun is waiting for you, right? I'll be just fine. Go ahead. Be with him. Go on. Go. Right... okay. I'm taking off. Saeko. Kaori? What's up? Aren't you drinking with Ma-kun? We're not drinking. That guy is a liar. Masaki... is married with kids. Listen to this... I can't help but laugh. We got into a huge fight. His wife suddenly showed up... Masaki... had no intention of staying with me. Guys are seriously... the worst. Garbage. There you go again... Masaki is a piece of shit. Tomoya is, too. Kaori? Kaori? Hello? Are you okay? I... wonder what path I should have taken. What? I can't hear you. I thought that if I came to Tokyo, something might actually change. But nothing has. I... don't think I'll ever change. I'll be the same anywhere I go. Hey... you're pretty drunk, aren't you? Come on home. Saeko, you don't get it! You're all about work! If people who counted on you were gone, like if Tomoya was gone, or if I were gone, you would be totally fine! But I don't have anything going for me! I don't even have anything I want to do! I can't find anything! I'm jealous. I've always been jealous Of you, you know. You can get by on your own. But for me... if I don't stick with someone, I'm just hopeless. I had no idea. Even Kaori has her struggles. Sae. Sorry I'm so late. Here. For you. Today is... well, how do I say it... It's you-know-what. It's the middle of the night, so maybe another time? No. Bang. I think that... times like this can still be romantic. This is great. It is. By the way... your call was answered by the new girl at work, right? Was that a problem? It was! I am not okay with it at all! Oh... Look. Uh... well... She just started working there, and if I scold her for answering phones on her own, she'll just cry. And I don't want you to get the wrong idea, either. What is it? You seem like you want to say something. Not really. It's great. If there are still moments like these, I feel that I can still get through life in my own way. Epilogue Epilogue The Nameless Tokyo Girls 7 years ago, could I have stayed up until morning like this? I'd love to tell myself 7 years ago that I will be okay. It doesn't matter where I am. The morning will always come. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning.
