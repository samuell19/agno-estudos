Nay, but this dotage of our general's overflows the measure Those his goodly eyes, that over the files and musters of the war have glowed like plated Mars... ...now bend, now turn the office and devotion of their view upon a tawny front His captain's heart, which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst the buckles on his breast... ...reneges all temper and is become the bellows and the fan to cool a gypsy's lust Look where they come Take but good note, and you shall see in him... ...the triple pillar of the world transformed into a strumpet's fool Behold and see If it be love indeed, tell me how much - There's beggary in the love that can be reckoned I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved - Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new Earth News, my good lord, from Rome - Grates me, the sum - Nay, hear him, Antony Fulvia perchance is angry Or who knows if the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent his powerful mandate to you 'Do this, or this, take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that' 'Perform it, or else we damn thee' - How, my love? - Perchance? Nay, and most like You must not stay here longer, your dismission is come from Caesar Therefore hear it, Antony Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's, I would say. Both? The messenger! As I am Egypt's queen, thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine is Caesar's homager Else so thy cheek pays shame when shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messenger! Let Rome in Tiber melt and the wide arch of the ranged empire fall. Here is my space Kingdoms are clay. Our dungy earth alike feeds beast as man The nobleness of life is to do thus When such a mutual pair and such a twain can do it... ...in which I bind, on pain of punishment, the world to wit we stand up peerless Excellent falsehood! Why did he marry Fulvia and not love her? I'll seem the fool I am not. Antony will be himself But stirred by Cleopatra Now for the love of Love and her soft hours, let's not confound the time with conference harsh There's not a minute of our lives should stretch without some pleasure. Now, what sport tonight? - Hear the ambassador - Fie, wrangling queen... ...whom everything becomes, to chide, to laugh, to weep Whose every passion fully strives to make itself, in thee, fair and admired No messenger but thine And all alone tonight we'll wander through the streets and note the qualities of people Come, my queen, last night you did desire it Boo! Speak not to us - Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight? - Sir, sometimes when he is not Antony... ...he comes too short of that great property which still should go with Antony I am full sorry that he approves the common liar who thus speaks of him at Rome Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost most absolute Alexas Where's the soothsayer that you praised so to the Queen? O, that I knew this husband which you say must change his horns with garlands - Soothsayer! - Your will? Is this the man? Is it you, sir, that know things? In nature's infinite book of secrecy a little I can read - Show him your hand Bring in the banquet quickly, wine enough Cleopatra's health to drink Good sir, give me good fortune - I make not, but foresee - Pray then, foresee me one - You shall be yet far fairer than you are - He means in flesh - No, you shall paint when you are old - Wrinkles forbid! - Vex not his prescience. Be attentive - Hush - You shall be more beloving than beloved - I had rather heat my liver with drinking Nay, hear him Good now, some excellent fortune Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon and widow them all Let me have a child at fifty to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage Find me to marry me with Octavius Caesar, and companion me with my mistress You shall outlive the lady whom you serve - O, excellent. I love long life better than figs You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune than that which is to approach Then belike my children shall have no names. Prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have? If every of your wishes had a womb, and fertile every wish, a million Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes - Nay, come. Tell Iras hers - We'll know all our fortunes Mine, and most of our fortunes tonight, shall be drunk to bed - There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else - Even as the overflowing Nilus presageth famine - Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay - Prithee, tell her but a workaday fortune - Your fortunes are alike - But how, but how? Give me particulars I have said - Am I not an inch of fortune better than she? Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I, where would you choose it? Not in my husband's nose Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas, come, his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee And let her die, too, and give him a worse, and let worse follow worse... ...till the worst of all follow him laughing to his grave, fiftyfold a cuckold Amen, dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people For, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow... - ...to behold a foul knave uncuckolded - Amen Lo now, if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold, they would make themselves whores but they'd do it - Saw you my lord? - No, lady - Was he not here? - No, madam He was disposed to mirth, but on the sudden a Roman thought hath struck him - Enobarbus - Madam? Seek him and bring him hither - Where's Alexas? - Here at your service - My lord approaches - We will not look upon him. Go with us Move, move - Fulvia thy wife first came into the field - Against my brother Lucius? Ay. But soon that war had end, and the time's state made friends of them... ...jointing their force 'gainst Caesar, whose better iss ue in the war from Italy upon the first encounter drave them Well, what worst? - The nature of bad news infects the teller - When it concerns the fool or coward On. Things that are past are done, with me 'Tis thus: Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death, I hear him as he flattered Labienus, this is stiff news, hath with his Parthian force extended Asia From Euphrates his conquering banner shook, from Syria to Lydia and to Ionia, whilst... - ...Antony, thou wouldst say? - O, my lord Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue Name Cleopatra as she is called in Rome. Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase And taunt my faults with such full licence as both truth and malice have power to utter Fulvia thy wife is dead - Where died she? - In Sicyon Her length of sickness, with what else more serious importeth thee to know, this bears Forbear me There's a great spirit gone. Thus did I desire it What our contempts doth often hurl from us, we wish it ours again She's good, being gone. The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on I must from this enchanting queen break off Ten thousand harms more than the ills I know my idleness doth hatch - Save me, Antony! - How now, Enobarbus! - What's your pleasure, sir? - I must with haste from hence Why then we kill all our women We see how mortal an unkindness is to them. If they suffer our departure, death's the word I must be gone Under a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity to cast them away for nothing Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies instantly I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment I do think there is cunning in death which commits some loving act upon her... - ...she hath such a celerity in dying - She is cunning past man's thought Alack, sir, no, her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears They are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report This cannot be cunning in her. If it be, she makes a shower of rain as well as Jove - Would I had never seen her - O, sir, you had then left unseen... ...a wonderful piece of work, which not to have been blest withal would have discredited your travel Fulvia is dead - Sir? - Fulvia is dead - Fulvia? - Dead Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented This grief is crowned with consolation. Your old smock brings forth a new petticoat The business she hath broached in the state cannot endure my absence And the business you have broached here cannot be without you Especially that of Cleopatra's, which wholly depends on your abode No more light answers I shall break the cause of our expedience to the Queen, and get her leave to part Sextus Pompeius hath given the dare to Caesar and commands the empire of the sea Our slippery people, whose love is never linked to the deserver till his deserts are past... ...begin to throw Pompey the Great and all his dignities upon his son Who, high in name and power, higher than both in blood and life, stands up for the main soldier Whose quality, going on, the sides of the world may danger Say our pleasure, to such whose place is under us, requires our quick remove from hence I shall do it - Where is he? - I did not see him since See where he is, who's with him, what he does. I did not send you If you find him sad, say I am dancing If in mirth, report that I am sudden sick. Quick, and return Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly... ...you do not hold the method to enforce the like from him What should I do, I do not? - In each thing give him way - Cross him in nothing Thou teachest like a fool the way to lose him - Tempt him not so too far. I wish, forbear - In time we hate that which we often fear But here comes Antony I am sick and sullen - I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose - Help me away, dear Charmian! I shall fall It cannot be thus long. The sides of nature will not sustain it - Now, my dearest queen... - Pray you stand farther from me - What's the matter? - I know by that same eye there's some good news What, says the married woman you may go? Would she had never given you leave to come Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here. I have no power upon you. Hers you are - The gods best know... - O, never was there queen so mightily betrayed Yet at the first I saw the treasons planted - Cleopatra... Why should I think you can be mine, and true... Though you in swearing shake the throned gods ...who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness, to be entangled with those mouth-made vows which break themselves in swearing - Most sweet queen... - Nay, pray you seek no colour for your going But bid farewell and go When you sued staying, then was the time for words. No going then Eternity was in our lips and eyes, bliss in our brows' bent None our parts so poor but was a race of heaven They are so still, or thou, the greatest soldier of the world, art turned the greatest liar - How now, lady? - I would I had thy inches Thou shouldst know there were a heart in Egypt - Hear me, queen The strong necessity of time commands our services awhile But my full heart remains in use with you Our Italy shines over with civil swords Sextus Pompeius makes his approaches to the port of Rome. Rich in his father's honour... ...he creeps apace into the hearts of such as have not thrived upon the present state My more particular, and that which most with you should safe my going, is Fulvia's death Though age from folly could not give me freedom, it does from childishness Can Fulvia die? She's dead, my queen. Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read the garboils she awaked At the last, best, see when and where she died O, most false love! Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill with sorrowful water? Now I see, I see, in Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be Quarrel no more. By the fire that quickens Nilus' slime... ...I go from hence thy soldier, servant, making peace or war as thou affects Cut my lace, Charmian, come! But let it be. I am quickly ill and well, so Antony loves My precious queen, forbear, and give true evidence to his love, which stands an honourable trial So Fulvia told me. I prithee turn aside and weep for her Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears belong to Egypt Good now, play one scene of excellent dissembling, and let it look like perfect honour - You'll heat my blood. No more! - You can do better yet, but this is meetly - Now by my sword... - ...and target Still he mends, but this is not the best Look, prithee, Charmian, how this Herculean Roman does become the carriage of his chafe - I'll leave you, lady - Courteous lord, one word Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it. That you know well Something it is I would... O, my oblivion is a very Antony, and I am all forgotten But that your royalty holds idleness your subject, I should take you for idleness itself 'Tis sweating labour to bear such idleness so near the heart as Cleopatra this But, sir, forgive me, since my becomings kill me when they do not eye well to you Your honour calls you hence Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly, and all the gods go with you Upon your sword sit laurel victory, and smooth success be strewed before your feet Let us go. Come Our separation so abides and flies that thou, residing here, goes yet with me And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee Away! You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know... ...it is not Caesar's natural vice to hate our great competitor From Alexandria this is the news He fishes, drinks, and wastes the lamps of night in revel Is not more manlike than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy more womanly than he Hardly gave audience, or vouchsafed to think he had partners You shall find there a man who is the abstract of all faults that all men follow I must not think there are evils enough to darken all his goodness His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven, more fiery by night's blackness Hereditary rather than purchased, what he cannot change than what he chooses You are too indulgent Let's grant it is not amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy... To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit and keep the turn of tippling with a slave... ...to reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet with knaves that smells of sweat Say this becomes him... As his composure must be rare indeed whom these things cannot blemish ...yet must Antony no way excuse his foils when we do bear so great weight in his lightness Here's more news Most noble Caesar, Pompey is strong at sea And it appears he is beloved of those that only have feared Caesar To the ports the discontents repair, and men's reports give him much wronged I should have known no less It hath been taught us from the primal state that he which is was wished until he were And the ebbed man, never loved till never worth love, comes deared by being lacked This common body, like to a vagabond flag upon the stream... ...goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide to rot itself with motion Caesar, I bring thee word Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates, makes the sea serve them... ...which they ear and wound with keels of every kind Many hot inroads they make in Italy and flush youth revolt No vessel can peep forth but 'tis as soon taken as seen For Pompey's name strikes more than could his war resisted Antony, leave thy lascivious wassails When thou once was beaten from Modena, at thy heel did famine follow Thou didst drink the stale of horses and the gilded puddle which beasts would cough at Thy palate then did deign the roughest berry on the rudest hedge Yea, like the stag when snow the pasture sheets, the barks of trees thou browsed On the Alps it is reported thou didst eat strange flesh which some did die to look on And all this... It wounds thine honour that I speak it now... ...was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek so much as lanked not - 'Tis pity of him - Let his shames quickly drive him to Rome 'Tis time we twain did show ourselves in the field, and to that end assemble we immediate council Pompey thrives in our idleness Tomorrow, Caesar, I shall be furnished to inform you rightly... ...both what by sea and land I can be able to front this present time Till which encounter, it is my business too. Farewell. Farewell, my lord. What you shall know meantime of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir... - ...to let me be partaker - Doubt not, sir. I knew it for my bond If the great gods be just they shall assist the deeds of justest men Know, worthy Pompey, that what they do delay they not deny I shall do well. The people love me, and the sea is mine My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope says it will come to the full Mark Antony in Egypt sits at dinner, and will make no wars without doors Caesar gets money where he loses hearts Lepidus flatters both, of both is flattered. But he neither loves, nor either cares for him Caesar and Lepidus are in the field. A mighty strength they carry - Where have you this? 'Tis false - From Menecrates, sir He dreams. I know they are in Rome together, looking for Antony But all the charms of love, salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip! Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts, keep his brain fuming Epicurean cooks sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite... ...that sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour even till a Lethe'd dullness - How now, Menecrates? - This is most certain that I shall deliver Mark Antony is every hour in Rome expected. Since he went from Egypt 'tis a space for farther travel I could have given less matter a better ear Menas, I did not think this amourous surfeiter would have donned his helm for such a petty war His soldiership is twice the other twain But let us rear the higher our opinion... ...that our stirring can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck the never lust-wearied Antony I cannot hope Caesar and Antony shall well greet together His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar. His brother warred upon him... ...although I think not moved by Antony But how the fear of us may cement their divisions and bind up the petty difference, we yet not know Be it as our gods will have it. It only stands our lives upon to use our strongest hands Come, Menas - Charmian - Madam? - Ha, ha! Give me to drink mandragora - Why, madam? That I might sleep out this great gap of time my Antony is away You think of him too much - O, 'tis treason - Madam, I trust not so - Thou, eunuch Mardian - What's your highness' pleasure? I take no pleasure in aught an eunuch has. Hast thou affections? - Yes, gracious madam - Indeed? Not in deed, madam, for I can do nothing but what indeed is honest to be done Yet have I fierce affections, and think what Venus did with Mars O, Charmian, where thinkest thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he? Or does he walk? Or is he on his horse? O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony! Do bravely, horse, for wot'st thou whom thou movest? The demi-Atlas of this Earth, the arm and burgonet of men He's speaking now, or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?' For so he calls me. Now I feed myself with most delicious poison Think on me, that am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black, and wrinkled deep in time O, Julius Caesar, when thou wast here above the ground, I was a morsel for a monarch And great Pompey would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow There would he anchor his aspect, and die with looking on his life Your Highness, your Majesty, Sovereign of Egypt, hail! How much unlike art thou Mark Antony Yet coming from him, that great medicine hath with his tinct gilded thee How goes it with my brave Mark Antony? Last thing he did, dear queen, he kissed, the last of many doubled kisses, this orient pearl - His speech sticks in my heart - Mine ear must pluck it thence 'Good friend', quoth he, 'Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends this treasure of an oyster' 'At whose foot, to mend the petty present, I will piece her opulent throne with kingdoms' 'All the East, ' say thou, 'shall call her mistress' What, was he sad, or merry? Like to the time of the year between the extremes of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry O, well-divided disposition Note him, note him, good Charmian, 'tis the man! But note him. He was not sad, for he would shine on those that make their looks by his He was not merry, which seemed to tell them his remembrance lay in Egypt with his joy But between both. O, heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry, the violence of either thee becomes, so does it no man's else - Met'st thou my posts? - Ay, madam, twenty several messengers Why do you send so thick? Who's born that day when I forget to send to Antony shall die a beggar Ink and paper, Charmian. Welcome, my good Alexas - Did I, Charmian, ever love Caesar so? - O, that brave Caesar! Be choked with such another emphasis - Say 'the brave Antony' - The valiant Caesar By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth if thou with Caesar paragon again my man of men By your most gracious pardon, I sing but after you My salad days, when I was green in judgment, cold in blood, to say as I said then But come, away, get me ink and paper He shall have every day a several greeting, or I'll unpeople Egypt Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed, and shall become you well... ...to entreat your captain to soft and gentle speech - I shall entreat him to answer like himself If Caesar move him, let Antony look over Caesar's head and speak as loud as Mars By Jupiter, were I the wearer of Antonio's beard, I would not shave it today 'Tis not a time for private stomaching Every time serves for the matter that is then born in it But small to greater matters must give way - Not if the small come first Your speech is passion. But pray you, stir no embers up - Here comes the noble Antony - And yonder Caesar If we compose well here, to Parthia. Hark, Ventidius I do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa Noble friends, that which combined us was most great, and let not a leaner action rend us What's amiss, may it be gently heard When we debate our trivial difference loud, we do commit murder in healing wounds Then, noble partners, the rather for I earnestly beseech... ...touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms 'Tis spoken well. Were we before our armies, and to fight, I should do thus - Welcome to Rome - Thank you - Sit - Sit, sir Nay, then I learn you take things ill which are not so, or, being, concern you not I must be laughed at if or for nothing or a little, I should say myself offended... ...and with you chiefly in the world More laughed at, that I should once name you derogately... ...when to sound your name it not concerned me My being in Egypt, Caesar, what was it to you? No more than my residing here at Rome might be to you in Egypt Yet if you there did practise on my state, your being in Egypt might be my question How intend you, practised? You may be pleased to catch at mine intent by what did here befall me Your wife and brother made wars upon me, and their contestation was theme for you You were the word of war You do mistake your business. My brother never did urge me in his act Of this my letters before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel, it must not be with this You praise yourself by laying defects of judgment to me, but you patched up your excuses Not so, not so. I know you could not lack. As for my wife... ...the third of the world is yours, which with a snaffle you may pace easy, but not such a wife Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to wars with the women I wrote to you when rioting in Alexandria. You did pocket up my letters... ...and with taunts did gibe my missive out of audience Sir, he fell upon me ere admitted, then Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want of what I was in the morning But next day told him of myself, which was as much as to have asked him pardon Let this fellow be nothing of our strife. If we contend, out of our question wipe him You have broken the article of your oath, which you shall never have tongue to charge me with - Soft, Caesar - No, Lepidus, let him speak The honour is sacred which he talks on now, supposing that I lacked it But on, Caesar. The article of my oath? To lend me arms and aid when I required them, the which you both denied Neglected, rather And then when poisoned hours had bound me up from mine own knowledge As nearly as I may I'll play the penitent to you Truth is that Fulvia, to have me out of Egypt, made wars here. For which myself... ...the ignorant motive, do so far ask pardon as befits mine honour to stoop in such a case 'Tis noble spoken If it might please you to enforce no further the griefs between you... ...to forget them quite were to remember that the present need speaks to atone you Worthily spoken, Maecenas Or, if you borrow one another's love for the instant, you may... ...when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more - That truth should be silent I had almost forgot You wrong this presence, therefore speak no more - Go to, then. Your considerate stone I do not much dislike the matter, but the manner of his speech For it cannot be we shall remain in friendship, our conditions so differing in their acts Yet if I knew what hoop should hold us staunch, from edge to edge of the world I would pursue it - Give me leave, Caesar - Speak, Agrippa Thou hast a sister by the mother's side, admired Octavia. Great Mark Antony is now a widower Say not so, Agrippa. If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof were well deserved of rashness I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear Agrippa further speak To hold you in perpetual amity, to make you brothers... ...and to knit your hearts with an unslipping knot, take Antony Octavia to his wife Whose beauty claims no worse a husband than the best of men Whose virtue and whose general graces speak that which none else can utter By this marriage all little jealousies, which now seem great... ...and all great fears, which now import their dangers, would then be nothing Truths would be tales, where now half-tales be truths Her love to both would each to other and all loves to both draw after her Pardon what I have spoke, for 'tis a studied, not a present thought, by duty ruminated Will Caesar speak? Not till he hears how Antony is touched with what is spoke already What power is in Agrippa, if I would say 'Agrippa, be it so', to make this good? The power of Caesar, and his power unto Octavia May I never to this good purpose, that so fairly shows, dream of impediment Let me have thy hand. Further this act of grace And from this hour the heart of brothers govern in our loves and sway our great designs There's my hand A sister I bequeath you whom no brother did ever love so dearly Let her live to join our kingdoms and our hearts, and never fly off our loves again Happily, amen I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey... ...for he hath laid strange courtesies and great of late upon me I must thank him only, lest my remembrance suffer ill report - At heel of that, defy him - Time calls upon us Of us must Pompey presently be sought, or else he seeks out us Haste we for it. Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms... ...dispatch we the business we have talked of With most gladness, and do invite you to my sister's view, whither straight I'll lead you Let us, Lepidus, not lack your company - Noble Antony, not sickness should detain me Welcome from Egypt, sir Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Maecenas! - My honourable friend Agrippa! - Good Enobarbus! We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested. You stayed well by it in Egypt Ay, sir, we did sleep day out of countenance and made the night light with drinking Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but twelve persons there. Is this true? This was but as a fly by an eagle We had much more monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up his heart upon the river of Cydnus There she appeared indeed, or my reporter devised well for her I will tell you The barge she sat in like a burnished throne burned on the water The poop was beaten gold, purple the sails, and so perfumed that the winds were lovesick with them The oars were silver, which to the tune of flutes kept stroke... ...and made the water which they beat to follow faster, as amorous of their strokes For her own person, it beggared all description She did lie in her pavilion, cloth-of-gold, of tissue... ...overpicturing that Venus where we see the fancy outwork nature On each side her stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids, with divers-coloured fans... ...whose wind did seem to glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool, and what they undid did O, rare for Antony! Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides, so many mermaids... ...tended her in the eyes, and made their bends adornings At the helm a seeming mermaid steers The silken tackle swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands that yarely frame the office From the barge a strange invisible perfume hits the sense of the adjacent wharfs The city cast her people out upon her And Antony, enthroned in the market-place, did sit alone, whistling to the air... ...which but for vacancy had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too, and made a gap in nature Rare Egyptian! Upon her landing, Antony sent to her, invited her to supper She replied it should be better he became her guest, which she entreated Our courteous Antony, whom never the word of 'No' woman heard speak... ...being barbered ten times over, goes to the feast And for his ordinary pays his heart for what his eyes eat only Royal wench! She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed He ploughed her, and she cropped I saw her once hop forty paces through the public street, and having lost her breath... ...she spoke and panted that she did make defect perfection, and breathless pour breath forth Now Antony must leave her utterly Never. He will not Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale her infinite variety Other women cloy the appetites they feed, but she makes hungry where most she satisfies For vilest things become themselves in her, that the holy priests bless her when she is riggish If beauty, wisdom, modesty can settle the heart of Antony, Octavia is a blessed lottery to him Let us go. Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest whilst you abide here Humbly, sir, I thank you The world and my great office will sometimes divide me from your bosom All which time before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers to them for you Goodnight, sir My Octavia, read not my blemishes in the world's report I have not kept my square, but that to come shall all be done by the rule Good night, dear lady - Goodnight, sir - Goodnight - Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt? - Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither If you can, your reason? I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue. But yet hie you to Egypt again Say to me, whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine? Caesar's If thou dost play with him at any game, thou art sure to lose And of that natural luck he beats thee against the odds Thy lustre thickens when he shines by. Thy spirit is all afraid to govern thee near him - But he away, 'tis noble - Get thee gone Say to Ventidius I would speak with him. He shall to Parthia Be it art or hap, he hath spoken true The very dice obey him, and in our sports my better cunning faints under his chance I will to Egypt And though I make this marriage for my peace, in the east my pleasure lies Give me some music. Music, moody food of us that trade in love The music, ho! Let it alone. Let's to billiards. Come, Charmian My arm is sore. Best play with Mardian As well a woman with an eunuch played as with a woman - Come, you'll play with me, sir? - As well as I can, madam And when good will is showed, though it come too short, the actor may plead pardon I'll none now. Give me mine angle, we'll to the river There, my music playing far off, I will betray tawny-finned fishes My bended hook shall pierce their slimy jaws, and as I draw them up... ...I'll think them every one an Antony and say 'Aha, you're caught' 'Twas merry when you wagered on your angling. When your diver did hang a salt fish on his hook... ...which he with fervency drew up That time? O, times! I laughed him out of patience, and that night I laughed him into patience And next morn, ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed... ...then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst I wore his sword Philippan O, from Italy! Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears, that long time have been barren - Madam, madam - Antonio's dead! If thou say so, villain, thou killest thy mistress But well and free, if thou so yield him, there is gold And here my bluest veins to kiss, a hand that kings have lipped, and trembled kissing - First, madam, he is well - Why, there's more gold But sirrah, mark, we use to say the dead are well Bring it to that, the gold I give thee will I melt and pour down thy ill-uttering throat - Good madam, hear me - Well, go to, I will But there's no goodness in thy face If Antony be free and healthful, so tart a favour to trumpet such good tidings If not well, thou shouldst come like a Fury crowned with snakes, not like a formal man - Will it please you hear me? - I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speakest Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well, or friends with Caesar or not captive to him... ...I'll set thee in a shower of gold and hail rich pearls upon thee - Madam, he's well - Well said - And friends with Caesar - Thou art an honest man Caesar and he are greater friends than ever - Make thee a fortune from me - But yet, madam... - I do not like 'But yet' It does allay the good precedence. Fie upon 'But yet' 'But yet' is as a jailer to bring forth some monstrous malefactor Prithee, friend, power out the pack of matter to mine ear, the good and bad together He's friends with Caesar, in state of health, thou sayest, and, thou sayest, free Free, madam, no. I made no such report. He's bound unto Octavia - For what good turn? - For the best turn in the bed I am pale, Charmian Madam, he's married to Octavia - The most infectious pestilence upon thee! - Good madam, patience! What say you? Hence, horrible villain, or I'll spurn thine eyes like balls before me. I'll unhair thy head Thou shalt be whipped with wire and stewed in brine, smarting in lingering pickle Gracious madam, I that do bring the news made not the match Say it is not so He is married, madam Rogue, thou hast lived too long Good madam, keep yourself within yourself. The man is innocent Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt Melt Egypt into Nile, and kindly creatures turn all to serpents Call the slave again. Though I am mad, I will not bite him. Call - He is afeard to come - I will not hurt him These hands do lack nobility that they strike a meaner than myself... ...since I myself have given myself the cause Come hither, sir Though it be honest, it is never good to bring bad news Give to a gracious message an host of tongues, but let ill tidings tell themselves when they be felt - I have done my duty - Is he married? I cannot hate thee worser than I do if thou again say 'yes' - He's married, madam - The gods confound thee! - Dost thou hold there still? - Should I lie, madam? O, I would thou didst, so half my Egypt were submerged and made a cistern for scaled snakes Go, get thee hence Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me thou wouldst appear most ugly - He is married? - I crave your Highness' pardon - He is married? - Take no offence that I would not offend you To punish me for what you make me do seems much unequal. He's married to Octavia O, that his fault should make a knave of thee, that art not what thou art sure of Get thee hence The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome are all too dear for me Lie they upon thy hand, and be undone by them Good your Highness, patience - In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar - Many times, madam - I am paid for it now Lead me from hence, I faint O, Iras, Charmian! 'Tis no matter Go to the fellow, good Alexas Bid him report the feature of Octavia, her years, her inclination Let him not leave out the colour of her hair. Bring me word quickly Let him forever go... Let him not, Charmian Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon, the other way's a Mars Bid you Alexas bring me word how tall she is Pity me, Charmian, but do not speak to me Your hostages I have, so have you mine, and we shall talk before we fight Most meet that first we come to words, and therefore have we our written purposes before us sent Which if thou hast considered, let us know if it will tie up thy discontented sword... ...and carry back to Sicily much tall youth that else must perish here To you all three, the senators alone of this great world, chief factors for the gods I do not know wherefore my father should revengers want, having a son and friends... ...since Julius Caesar, who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted, there saw you labouring for him What was it that moved pale Cassius to conspire? And what made the all-honoured, honest, Roman Brutus, with the armed rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom... ...to drench the Capitol, but that they would have one man but a man? And that is it hath made me rig my navy, at whose burden the angered ocean foams With which I meant to scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome cast on my noble father Take your time Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails. We'll speak with thee at sea At land thou knowest how much we do overcount thee At land indeed thou dost overcount me of my father's house But since the cuckoo builds not for himself, remain in it as thou mayst Be pleased to tell us, for this is from the present, how you take the offers we have sent you - There's the point - Which do not be entreated to... ...but weigh what it is worth embraced - And what may follow, to try a larger fortune You have made me offer of Sicily, Sardinia And I must rid all the sea of pirates, then to send measures of wheat to Rome This agreed upon, to part with unhacked edges and bear back our targes undinted That's our offer Know then, I came before you here a man prepared to take this offer But Mark Antony put me to some impatience Though I lose the praise of it by telling, you must know when Caesar and your brother were at blows... ...your mother came to Sicily and did find her welcome friendly I have heard it, Pompey, and am well studied for a liberal thanks, which I do owe you Let me have your hand I did not think, sir, to have met you here The beds in the East are soft And thanks to you, that called me timelier than my purpose hither, for I have gained by it Since I saw you last, there's a change upon you Well, I know not what counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face But in my bosom shall she never come to make my heart her vassal - Well met here - I hope so, Lepidus Thus we are agreed. I crave our composition may be written and sealed between us That's the next to do We'll feast each other ere we part, and let's draw lots who shall begin - That will I, Pompey - No, Antony, take the lot But, first or last, your fine Egyptian cookery shall have the fame I have heard that Julius Caesar grew fat with feasting there You have heard much - I have fair meanings, sir - And fair words to them Aboard my galley I invite you all Thy father, Pompey, would never have made this treaty You and I have known, sir - At sea, I think - We have, sir - You have done well by water - And you by land I will praise any man that will praise me, though it cannot be denied what I have done by land Nor what I have done by water - Yes, something you can deny for your own safety - You have been a great thief by sea - And you by land There I deny my land service But give me your hand, Menas. We came hither to fight with you For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking. Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune If he do, sure he cannot weep it back again - You have said, sir We looked not for Mark Antony here. Pray you, is he married to Cleopatra? Caesar's sister is called Octavia - True, sir. She was the wife of Caius Marcellus But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius - Pray you, sir? 'Tis true - Then is Caesar and he forever knit together If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not prophesy so I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties I think so, too. But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together... ...will be the very strangler of their amity Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation - Who would not have his wife so? Not he that himself is not so, which is Mark Antony. He will to his Egyptian dish again - He married but his occasion here - And thus it may be Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a health for you I shall take it, sir. We have used our throats in Egypt Thus do they, sir. They take the flow of the Nile by certain scales in the Pyramid They know by the height, the lowness, or the mean if dearth or foison follow The higher Nilus swells, the more it promises As it ebbs, the seedsman upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain, and shortly comes to harvest - You've strange serpents there? - Ay, Lepidus Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun - So is your crocodile - They are so - Sit, and some wine. A health to Lepidus - Lepidus! I am not so well as I should be, but I'll never out Not till you have slept. I fear me you'll be in till then Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are very goodly things Without contradiction I have heard that - Pompey, a word - Say, what is it? Forsake thy sport, I do beseech thee, captain, and hear me speak a word Forbear me till anon - This health to Lepidus - Lepidus! What manner of thing is your crocodile? It is shaped, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it hath breadth It is just so high as it is, and moves with it own organs It lives by that which nourisheth it, and the elements once out of it, it transmigrates - What colour is it of? - Of it own colour too - 'Tis a strange serpent - 'Tis so, and the tears of it are wet Will this description satisfy him? With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a very epicure Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me of that? Away! Do as I bid you If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear me, rise from thy stool - I think thou art mad. The matter? - I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes Thou hast served me with much faith. What's else to say? Be jolly, lords These quicksands, Lepidus, keep off them, for you sink - Wilt thou be lord of all the world? - What sayst thou? - Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice - How should that be? But entertain it, and though thou think me poor, I am the man will give thee all the world - Hast thou drunk well? - No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove Whatever the ocean pales or sky inclips is thine, if thou wilt have it Show me which way These three world-sharers, these competitors, are in thy vessel Let me cut the cable, and when we are put off, fall to their throats. All there is thine Ah, this thou shouldst have done and not have spoke on it In me 'tis villainy. In thee it had been good service Thou must know 'tis not my profit that does lead mine honour. Mine honour, it Repent that ever thy tongue hath so betrayed thine act Being done unknown, I should have found it afterwards well done But must condemn it now. Desist and drink For this I'll never follow thy palled fortunes more Who seeks and will not take when once 'tis offered shall never find it more - This health to Lepidus - Lepidus! Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey - There's a strong fellow, Menas - Why? He bears the third part of the world, man, see'st not? The third part, then, is drunk. Would it were all, that it might go on wheels - Drink thou. Increase the reels - Come This is not yet an Alexandrian feast - It ripens towards it. Strike the vessel, ho! Here's to Caesar I could well forbear it. It's monstrous labour when I wash my brain and it grows fouler - Be a child of the time - Possess it, I'll make answer But I had rather fast from all, four days, than drink so much in one Come, let's all take hands till that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense in soft and delicate Lethe All take hands Come, thou monarch of the vine, Plumpy Bacchus, with pink eyne! In thy vats our cares be drowned, With thy grapes our hairs be crowned! Cup us till the world go round! What would you more? Pompey, goodnight Good brother, let me request you off. Our graver business frowns at this levity Gentle lords, let's part. You see we have burnt our cheeks Strong Enobarb is weaker than the wine, and mine own tongue splits what it speaks The wild disguise hath almost anticked us all. What needs more words? Goodnight. Good Antony, your hand - I'll try you on the shore - And shall, sir. Give us your hand O, Antony, you have my father's house But what? We are friends. Come down into the boat - What, are the brothers parted? - They have dispatched with Pompey He is gone. The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps to part from Rome. Caesar is sad And Lepidus, since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled with the green sickness - 'Tis a noble Lepidus - A very fine one - O, how he loves Caesar - Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony - Caesar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men - What's Antony? The god of Jupiter - Spake you of Caesar? How, the nonpareil - O Antony, O thou Arabian bird Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar'. Go no further Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises - But he loves Antony, yet he loves Caesar Hoo, hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets... ...cannot think, speak, cast, write, sing, number, his love to Antony But as for Caesar, kneel down, kneel down, and wonder - Both he loves - They are his shards and he their beetle - So, this is to Athens. Adieu, noble Agrippa - Good fortune, worthy soldier, and farewell No further, sir You take from me a great part of myself. Use me well in it Sister, prove such a wife as my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest bond shall pass on thy approof Most noble Antony, let not the piece of virtue which is set betwixt us... ...as the cement of our love to keep it builded, be the ram to batter the fortress of it For better might we have loved without this mean, if on both parts this be not cherished - Make me not offended in your distrust - I have said You shall not find, though you be therein curious, the least cause for what you seem to fear So the gods keep you, and make the hearts of Romans serve your ends We will here part Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well The elements be kind to thee and make thy spirits all of comfort. Fare thee well My noble brother The April's in her eyes. It is love's spring, and these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful Sir, look well to my husband's house, and... - What, Octavia? - I'll tell you in your ear Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can her heart inform her tongue The swan's-down feather that stands upon the swell at the full of tide, and neither way inclines - Will Caesar weep? - Why, Enobarbus When Antony found Julius Caesar dead, he cried almost to roaring And he wept when at Philippi he found Brutus slain That year indeed he was troubled with a rheum No, sweet Octavia, you shall hear from me still. The time shall not outgo my thinking on you Come, sir, come, I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love Look, here I have you, thus I let you go, and give you to the gods Adieu, be happy Let all the number of the stars give light to thy fair way Farewell, farewell Farewell - Where is the fellow? - Half afeard to come Go to, go to. Come hither, sir Good Majesty, Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you but when you are well pleased That Herod's head I'll have But how, when Antony is gone, through whom I might command it? - Come thou near - Most gracious Majesty - Did'st thou behold Octavia? - Ay, dread queen - Where? - Madam, in Rome I looked her in the face and saw her led between her brother and Mark Antony Is she as tall as me? She is not, madam - Didst hear her speak? Is she shrill-tongued or low? - Madam, I heard her speak. She is low-voiced That's not so good. He cannot like her long - Like her? O Isis, 'tis impossible! - I think so, Charmian Dull of tongue, and dwarfish What majesty is in her gait? Remember, if ever thou looked'st on majesty She creeps. Her motion and her station are as one She shows a body rather than a life, a statue, than a breather - Is this certain? - Or I have no observance Three in Egypt cannot make better note He's very knowing, I do perceive it. There's nothing in her yet - The fellow has good judgment - Excellent - Guess at her years, I prithee - Madam, she was a widow - Widow? Charmian, hark - And I do think she's thirty - Bearest thou her face in mind? Is it long or round? - Round even to faultiness For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so. Her hair what colour? Brown, madam, and her forehead as low as she would wish it There's gold for thee. Thou must not take my former sharpness ill I will employ thee back again. I find thee most fit for business Go, make thee ready. Our letters are prepared - A proper man - Indeed he is so I repent me much that so I harried him. Why, methinks... ...by him, this creature's no such thing Nothing, madam The man hath seen some majesty, and should know Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend, and serving you so long! I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian But 'tis no matter. Thou shalt bring him to me where I will write - All may be well enough - I warrant you, madam How now, friend Eros? - There's strange news come, sir - What, man? Caesar and Lepidus have made new wars upon Pompey This is old. What is the success? Caesar, having made use of Lepidus in the wars 'gainst Pompey... ...presently denied him rivality, would not let him partake in the glory of the action And, not resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly wrote to Pompey Upon his own appeal seizes him - So the poor third is up - Till death enlarge his confine Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more And throw between them all the food thou hast, they'll grind the one the other Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that That were excusable, that and thousands more of semblable import But he hath waged new wars against Pompey, made his will and read it to public ear Spoke scantly of me. When perforce he could not but pay me terms of honour... - ...cold and sickly he vented them - O, my good lord, believe not all Or if you must believe, stomach not all A more unhappy lady, if this division chance, never stood between, praying for both parts The good gods will mock me presently when I shall pray 'O, bless my lord and husband' Undo that prayer by crying out as loud 'O, bless my brother' Husband win, win brother prays and destroys the prayer No midway 'twixt these extremes at all Gentle Octavia, let your best love draw to that point which seeks best to preserve it If I lose mine honour, I lose myself. Better I were not yours than yours so branchless But, as you requested, yourself shall go between us The meantime, lady, I'll raise the preparation of a war shall stain your brother Make your soonest haste, so your desires are yours Thanks to my lord. The Jove of power make me, most weak, most weak, your reconciler Wars 'twixt you twain would be as if the world should cleave... ...and that slain men should solder up the rift Provide your going. Choose your own company, and command what cost your heart has mind to Contemning Rome, he has done all this and more in Alexandria Here's the manner of it. In the marketplace, on a tribunal silvered... ...Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold were publicly enthroned At their feet sat Caesarion, whom they call my father's son... ...and all the unlawful issue that their lust since then hath made between them Unto her he gave the stablishment of Egypt Made her of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia, absolute queen - This in the public eye? - In the common showplace where they exercise His sons he there proclaimed the kings of kings Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia he gave to Alexander To Ptolemy he assigned Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia She in the habiliments of the goddess Isis that day appeared And oft before gave audience, as 'tis reported, so - Let Rome be thus informed Who, queasy with his insolence already, will their good thoughts call from him The people knows it, and have now received his accusations Who does he accuse? Caesar, and that, having in Sicily Sextus Pompeius spoiled... ...we had not rated him his part of the isle Then does he say he lent me some shipping, unrestored Lastly, he frets that Lepidus of the triumvirate should be deposed And, being, that we detain all his revenue - Sir, this should be answered - 'Tis done already, and the messenger gone I have told him Lepidus was grown too cruel That he his high authority abused and did deserve his change For what I have conquered, I grant him part But then in his Armenia and other of his conquered kingdoms I demand the like - He'll never yield to that - Nor must not then be yielded to in this Hail, Caesar, and my lords! Hail, most dear Caesar - That ever I should call thee castaway! - You have not called me so, nor have you cause Why have you stolen upon us thus? You come not like Caesar's sister The wife of Antony should have an army for an usher... ...and the neighs of horse to tell of her approach long ere she did appear The trees by the way should have borne men, and expectation fainted, longing for what it had not Nay, the dust should have ascended to the roof of heaven, raised by your populous troops But you are come a market-maid to Rome... ...and have prevented the ostentation of our love, which, left unshown, is often left unloved Good my lord, to come thus was I not constrained, but did it on my free will My lord, Mark Antony, hearing that you prepared for war... ...acquainted my grieved ear withal, whereon I begged his pardon for return Which soon he granted, being an abstract 'tween his lust and him Do not say so, my lord I have eyes upon him, and his affairs come to me on the wind - Where is he now? - My lord, in Athens No, my most wronged sister. Cleopatra hath nodded him to her He hath given his empire up to a whore, who now are levying the kings of the Earth for war He hath assembled Bocchus, the King of Libya, Archelaus of Cappadocia... Philadelphos, King of Paphlagonia the Thracian king, Adallas... King Manchus of Arabia, King of Pont, Herod of Jewry, Mithridates, King of Comagen... Polemon and Amyntas, the Kings of Mede and Lycaonia... ...with a more larger list of sceptres Ay me, most wretched, that have my heart parted betwixt two friends that does afflict each other! Welcome to Rome, nothing more dear to me You are abused beyond the mark of thought... ...and the high gods, to do you justice, makes his ministers of us and those that love you - Welcome, lady - Welcome, dear madam Each heart in Rome does love and pity you Only the adulterous Antony, most large in his abominations, turns you off... ...and gives his potent regiment to a trull that noises it against us - Is it so, sir? - Most certain. Sister, welcome Pray you, be ever known to patience. My dearest sister! - I will be even with thee, doubt it not - But why, why, why? Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars and say'st it is not fit Well, is it, is it? Is it not denounced against us? Why should not we be there in person? Your presence needs must puzzle Antony Take from his heart, take from his brain, from his time, what should not then be spared He is already traduced for levity And 'tis said in Rome that Mardian, an eunuch, and your maids manage this war Sink Rome, and their tongues rot that speak against us! A charge we bear in the war, and as the president of my kingdom will appear there for a man Speak not against it. I will not stay behind Nay, I have done. Here comes the Emperor Is it not strange, Ventidius, that from Tarentum and Brundusium... ...he could so quickly cut the Ionian Sea and take in Toryne? - You have heard on it, sweet? - Celerity is never more admired than by the negligent A good rebuke, which might have well becomed the best of men, to taunt at slackness - Ventidius, we will fight with him by sea - By sea, what else? - Why will my lord do so? - For that he dares us to it So hath my lord dared him to single fight Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia, where Caesar fought with Pompey But these offers, which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off, and so should you Your ships are not well manned, your mariners are muleteers, reapers, people engrossed by swift impress In Caesar's fleet are those that often have against Pompey fought Their ships are yare, yours heavy. No disgrace shall fall you for refusing him at sea... - ...being prepared for land - By sea, by sea Most worthy sir, you therein throw away the absolute soldiership you have by land... Distract your army, which doth most consist of war-marked footmen... Leave unexecuted your own renowned knowledge, quite forgo the way which promises assurance... ...and give up yourself merely to chance and hazard from firm security - I'll fight at sea - I have sixty sails, Caesar none better Our overplus of shipping will we burn, and with the rest full-manned... ...from the head of Actium beat the approaching Caesar But if we fail, we then can do it at land - Scarus, thy business? - The news is true, my lord, he is descried - Caesar has taken Toryne - Can he be there in person? 'Tis impossible, strange that his power should be Ventidius, our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land, and our twelve thousand horse We'll to our ship. Away, my Thetis O noble emperor, do not fight by sea! Trust not to rotten planks Do you misdoubt this sword and these my wounds? Let the Egyptians and the Phoenicians go a-ducking We have used to conquer standing on the earth and fighting foot to foot Well, well, away By Hercules, I think I am in the right Soldier, thou art, but his whole action grows not in the power on it So our leader's led, and we are women's men Strike not by land, keep whole. Provoke not battle till we have done at sea Set we our squadrons on yond side of the hill in eye of Caesar's battle Our fortune lies upon this jump Naught, naught, all naught! I can behold no longer The Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral, with all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder To see it mine eyes are blasted - Gods and goddesses, all the whole synod of them! - What's thy passion? The greater cantle of the world is lost with very ignorance We have kissed away kingdoms and provinces - How appears the fight? On our side, like the tokened pestilence, where death is sure Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt, whom leprosy overtake, in the midst of the fight... When vantage like a pair of twins appeared both as the same, or rather, ours the elder... ...the breeze upon her like a cow in June, hoists sails and flies That I beheld. Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not endure a further view She once being loofed, the noble ruin of her magic, Antony... ...claps on his sea-wing and, like a doting mallard, leaving the fight in height, flies after her I never saw an action of such shame Experience, manhood, honour never before did violate so itself Alack, alack Our fortune on the sea is out of breath and sinks most lamentably Had our general been what he knew himself, it had gone well O, he has given example for our flight most grossly by his own Ay, are you thereabouts? Why then, goodnight indeed Toward Peloponnesus are they fled. 'Tis easy to it, and there I will attend what further comes To Caesar will I render my legions and my horse I'll yet follow the wounded chance of Antony, though my reason sits in the wind against me Hark, the land bids me tread no more upon it. It is ashamed to bear me Friends, come hither I am so lated in the world that I have lost my way forever I have a ship laden with gold. Take that, divide it. Fly, and make your peace with Caesar I have myself resolved upon a course which has no need of you Let that be left which leaves itself. To the sea-side straightway Leave me, I pray, a little. Pray you, now Nay, do so. For indeed I have lost command. Therefore I pray you, I'll see you by and by Nay, gentle madam, to him, comfort him - Do, most dear queen - Do! Why, what else? Let me sit down. O Juno! No, no, no, no, no - See you here, sir? - Oh fie, fie, fie! - Madam - Madam, O good empress - Sir, sir... - Yes, my lord, yes Octavius at Philippi kept his sword even like a dancer, while I struck the lean and wrinkled Cassius And 'twas I that the mad Brutus ended Octavius alone dealt on lieutenantry, and no practice had in the brave squares of war Yet now... no matter Ah, stand by The Queen, my lord, the Queen Go to him, madam, speak to him. He's unqualitied with very shame Well, then, sustain me Most noble sir, arise. The Queen approaches Her head's declined, and death will seize her but your comfort makes the rescue I have offended reputation, a most unnoble swerving Sir, the Queen O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See how I convey my shame out of thine eyes... ...by looking back what I have left behind 'stroyed in dishonour O, my lord, my lord, forgive my fearful sails! I little thought you would have followed Egypt, thou knew'st too well my heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings... ...and thou shouldst tow me after Over my spirit thy full supremacy thou knewest, and that thy beck... ...might from the bidding of the gods command me - O, my pardon! Now I must to the young man send humble treaties, dodge and palter in the shifts of lowness... ...who with half the bulk of the world played as I pleased, making and marring fortunes You did know how much you were my conqueror And that my sword, made weak by my affection, would obey it on all cause Pardon, pardon! Fall not a tear, I say. One of them rates all that is won and lost Give me a kiss Even this repays me We sent our schoolmaster. Is he come back? Love, I am full of lead Some wine within there, and our viands! Fortune knows we scorn her most when most she offers blows Let him appear that's come from Antony - Know you him? - Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster An argument that he is plucked, when hither he sends so poor a pinion of his wing... ...which had superfluous kings for messengers not many moons gone by Approach, and speak - Such as I am, I come from Antony - Declare thine office Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and requires to live in Egypt Which not granted, he lessens his requests, and to thee sues... ...to let him breathe between the heavens and earth, a private man in Athens. This for him Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness, submits her to thy might... ...and of thee craves the circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs, now hazarded to thy grace For Antony, I have no ears to his request The Queen of audience nor desire shall fail... ...so she from Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend, or take his life there This if she perform, she shall not sue unheard. So to them both - Fortune pursue thee - Bring him through the bands To try thy eloquence now 'tis time, dispatch. From Antony win Cleopatra Promise, and in our name, what she requires. Add more, from thine invention, offers Women are not in their best fortunes strong, but want will perjure the never-touched vestal Try thy cunning, Demetrius Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we will answer as a law - Caesar, I go - Observe how Antony becomes his flaw... ...and what thou think'st his very action speaks in every power that moves Caesar, I shall - What shall we do, Enobarbus? - Think, and die Is Antony or we in fault for this? Antony only, that would make his will lord of his reason What though you fled from that great face of war, whose several ranges frighted each other? Why should he follow? The itch of his affection should not then have nicked his captainship 'Twas a shame no less than was his loss, to course your flying flags and leave his navy gazing Prithee, peace - Is that his answer? - Ay, my lord The Queen shall then have courtesy, so she will yield us up? - He says so - Let her know it To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head, and he will fill thy wishes to the brim with principalities That head, my lord? To him again. Tell him he wears the rose of youth upon him... ...from which the world should note something particular His coin, ships, legions may be a coward's. I dare him therefore... ...to lay his gay caparisons apart and answer me declined, sword against sword, ourselves alone I'll write it. Follow me Yes, like enough, high-battled Caesar will unstate his happiness... ...and be staged to the show against a sworder That he should dream, knowing all measures, the full Caesar will answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdued his judgment too - A messenger from Caesar - What, no more ceremony? Admit him, sir Mine honesty and I begin to square The loyalty well held to fools does make our faith mere folly Yet he that can endure to follow with allegiance a fallen lord... ...does conquer him that did his master conquer, and earns a place in the story - Caesar's will? - Hear it apart - None but friends. Say boldly - So haply are they friends to Antony He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has, or needs not us If Caesar please, our master will leap to be his friend For us, you know whose he is, we are, and that is Caesar's So. Thus then, thou most renowned Caesar entreats not to consider in what case thou standest further than he is Caesar Go on. Right royal He knows that you embrace not Antony as you did love, but as you feared him The scars upon your honour therefore he does pity as constrained blemishes, not as deserved He is a god and knows what is most right. Mine honour was not yielded, but conquered merely To be sure of that, I will ask Antony Shall I say to Caesar what you require of him? For he partly begs to be desired to give It much would please him that of his fortunes you should make a staff to lean upon But it would warm his spirits to hear from me you had left Antony... ...and put yourself under his shroud, the universal landlord - What's your name? - My name is Demetrius Most kind messenger, say to great Caesar this in deputation I kiss his conquering hand. Tell him I am prompt to lay my crown at his feet, and there to kneel Tell him, from his all-obeying breath I hear the doom of Egypt 'Tis your noblest course. Give me grace to lay my duty on your hand Your Caesar's father oft, when he hath mused of taking kingdoms in... ...bestowed his lips on that unworthy place as it rained kisses Favours? By Jove that thunders! Approach, there Ah, you kite! Now, gods and devils! Authority melts from me of late Have you no ears? I am Antony yet. Take hence this jack and whip him 'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp than with an old one dying Moon and stars, whip him Were it twenty of the greatest tributaries that do acknowledge Caesar... ...should I find them so saucy with the hand of she here... What's her name, since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows, till like a boy you see him cringe his face and whine aloud for mercy - Take him hence - Mark Antony! Tug him away. Being whipped, bring him again This jack of Caesar's shall bear us an errand to him You were half blasted ere I knew you Have I my pillow left unpressed in Rome, forborne the getting of a lawful race... ...and by a gem of women, to be abused by one that looks on feeders? Good my lord... - You have been a boggler ever - O, is it come to this? I found you as a morsel cold upon dead Caesar's trencher Nay, you were a fragment of Gnaeus Pompey's... ...besides what hotter hours, unregistered in vulgar fame, you have luxuriously picked out - Wherefore is this? - To let a fellow that will take rewards... ...and say 'God quit you!' be familiar with my playfellow, your hand This kingly seal and plighter of high hearts! O, that I were upon the hill of Basan, to outroar the horned herd - Is he whipped? - Soundly, my lord - Cried he? And begged he pardon? - He did ask favour If that thy father live, let him repent thou wast not made his daughter And be thou sorry to follow Caesar in his triumph, since thou hast been whipped for following him Henceforth the white hand of a lady fever thee. Shake thou to look on it Get thee back to Caesar, tell him thy entertainment Look thou say he makes me angry with him... ...for he seems proud and disdainful, harping on what I am, not what he knew I was He makes me angry And at this time most easy 'tis to do it, when my good stars that were my former guides... ...have empty left their orbs and shot their fires into the abysm of hell If he mislike my speech and what is done, tell him he has Scarus, my enfranched bondman... ...whom he may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture, as he shall like to quit me Urge it thou Hence with thy stripes, begone Have you done yet? Alack, our terrene moon is now eclipsed, and it portends alone the fall of Antony I must stay his time To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes with one that ties his points? - Not know me yet? - Cold-hearted toward me? Ah, dear, if I be so, from my cold heart let heaven engender hail and poison it in the source And the first stone drop in my neck. As it determines, so dissolve my life The next Caesarion smite, till by degrees the memory of my womb... ...together with my brave Egyptians all, by the discandying of this pelleted storm lie graveless Till the flies and gnats of Nile have buried them for prey I am satisfied Caesar sets down in Alexandria, where I will oppose his fate Our force by land hath nobly held Our severed navy too have knit again, and fleet, threatening most sealike Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady? If from the field I shall return once more to kiss these lips, I will appear in blood I and my sword will earn our chronicle - There's hope in it yet - That's my brave lord I will be treble-sinewed, -hearted, breathed, and fight maliciously It is my birthday. I had thought to have held it poor But since my lord is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra We will yet do well Call all his noble captains to my lord Do so, we'll speak to them, and tonight I'll force the wine peep through their scars Come on, my queen, there's sap in it yet The next time I do fight I'll make Death love me, for I will contend even with his pestilent scythe Now he'll outstare the lightning To be furious is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood the dove will peck the estridge And I see still a diminution in our captain's brain restores his heart When valour preys on reason, it eats the sword it fights with I will seek some way to leave him He calls me 'boy', and chides as he had power to beat me out of Egypt Demetrius he hath whipped with rods, dares me to personal combat, Caesar to Antony Let the old ruffian know I have many other ways to die. Meantime laugh at his challenge Caesar must think, when one so great begins to rage, he's hunted even to falling Give him no breath, but now make boot of his distraction. Never anger made good guard for itself Let our best heads know that tomorrow the last of many battles we mean to fight Within our files there are, of those that served Mark Antony but late, enough to fetch him in See it done, and feast the army We have store to do It, and they have earned the waste Poor Antony He will not fight with me, Domitius? - No - Why should he not? He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune, he is twenty men to one Tomorrow, soldier, by sea and land I'll fight Or I will live, or bathe my dying honour in the blood shall make it live again - Woo't thou fight well? - I'll strike and cry 'Take all' Well said. Come on Call forth my household servants. Let's tonight be bounteous at our meal Give me thy hand Thou hast been rightly honest So hast thou, thou, and thou, and thou You have served me well, and kings have been your fellows Well, my good fellows, wait on me tonight. Scant not my cups... ...and make as much of me as when mine empire was your fellow too, and suffered my command - What does he mean? - To make his followers weep Tend me tonight. Maybe it is the period of your duty Haply you shall not see me more, or if, a mangled shadow Perchance tomorrow you'll serve another master I look on you as one that takes his leave Mine honest friends, I turn you not away But, like a master married to your good service, stay till death Tend me tonight two hours, I ask no more, and the gods yield you for it What mean you, sir, to give them this discomfort? Look, they weep And I, an ass, am onion-eyed. For shame, transform us not to women Now the witch take me if I meant it thus! Grace grow where those drops fall Know, my hearts, I hope well of tomorrow, and will lead you... ...where rather I'll expect victorious life than death and honour Let's to supper, come, and drown consideration Brother, goodnight. Tomorrow is the day It will determine one way. Fare you well - Heard you of nothing strange about the streets? - Nothing. What news? - Belike 'tis but a rumour. Goodnight to you - Well, sir, goodnight - Soldiers, have careful watch - And you. Goodnight, goodnight Here we. And if tomorrow our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope our landmen will stand up 'Tis a brave army, and full of purpose Peace. What noise? - List, list - Hark - Music in the air - Under the earth - It bodes well, does it not? - No Peace, I say. What should this mean? 'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony loved, now leaves him Follow the noise so far as we have quarter. Let's see how it will give off - Content - 'Tis strange Eros! Mine armour, Eros! - Sleep a little - No, my chuck Eros, come, mine armour, Eros! Come, good fellow, put mine iron on If fortune be not ours today, it is because we brave her. Come Nay, I'll help too - What's this for? - Ah, let be, let be Thou art the armourer of my heart False, false. This, this! Sooth, la, I'll help. Thus it must be Well, well, we shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow? - Go, put on thy defences - Briefly, sir - Is not this buckled well? - Rarely, rarely He that unbuckles this, till we do please to doff it for our repose, shall hear a storm Thou fumblest, Eros, and my queen's a squire more tight at this than thou Dispatch O love, that thou couldst see my wars today, and knewest the royal occupation... ...thou shouldst see a workman in it The gods make this a happy day to Antony Would thou and those thy scars before prevailed to make me fight at land Had'st thou done so, the kings that have revolted and the soldier that has this morning left thee... ...would have still followed thy heels - Who's gone this morning? - Who? One ever near thee Call for Enobarbus, he shall not hear thee, or from Caesar's camp say 'I am none of thine' - What sayest thou? - Sir, he is with Caesar Sir, his chests and treasure he has not with him - Is he gone? - Most certain Go, Eros, send his treasure after. Do it Detain no jot, I charge thee Write to him, I will subscribe, gentle adieus and greetings Say that I wish he never find more cause to change a master O, my fortunes have corrupted honest men Dispatch Enobarbus! Fare thee well, dame Whatever becomes of me, this is a soldier's kiss Rebukable and worthy shameful check it were to stand on more mechanic compliment I'll leave thee now like a man of steel You that will fight, follow me close. I'll bring you to it Adieu Please you retire to your chamber? Lead me. He goes forth gallantly That he and Caesar might determine this great war in single fight! Then Antony... But now... Well, on Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight. Our will is Antony be took alive - Make it so known - Caesar, I shall The time of universal peace is near Prove this a prosperous day, the three-nooked world shall bear the olive freely Antony is come into the field Go charge Agrippa, plant those that have revolted in the van... ...that Antony may seem to spend his fury upon himself Alexas did revolt. For this pains, Caesar hath hanged him Scarus and the rest that fell away have entertainment but no honourable trust I have done ill Of which I do accuse myself so sorely that I will joy no more Enobarbus, Antony hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with his bounty overplus The messenger came on my guard, and at thy tent is now unloading of his mules I give it you Mock not, Enobarbus, I tell you true. Your emperor continues still a Jove I am alone the villain of the Earth, and feel I am so most O Antony, thou mine of bounty How wouldst thou have paid my better service, when my turpitude thou dost so crown with gold? This blows my heart If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean shall outstrike thought But thought will do it, I feel I fight against thee? No I will go seek some ditch wherein to die. The foulest best fits my latter part of life We have beat him to his camp. Run one before and let the Queen know of our deeds Tomorrow before the sun shall see us, we'll spill the blood that has today escaped You have shown all Hectors. Enter the city. Clip your wives, your friends Tell them your feats, whilst they with joyful tears... ...wash the congealment from your wounds and kiss the honoured gashes whole Lord of lords! O infinite virtue, comest thou smiling from the world's great snare uncaught? Mine nightingale, we have beat them to their beds Behold this man, commend unto his lips thy favouring hand Kiss it, my warrior. He hath fought today as if a god in hate of mankind had destroyed in such a shape I'll give thee, friend, an armour all of gold. It was a king's He has deserved it, were it carbuncled like holy Phoebus' car Give me thy hands Had our great palace the capacity to camp this host, we all would sup together... ...and drink carouses to the next day's fate, which promises royal peril Trumpeters, with brazen din blast you the city's ear... ...that heaven and Earth may strike their sounds together, applauding our approach O, bear me witness, night. Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon When men revolted shall upon record bear hateful memory... ...poor Enobarbus did before thy face repent O sovereign mistress of true melancholy, the poisonous damp of night dispunge upon me That life, a very rebel to my will, may hang no longer on me Throw my heart against the flint and hardness of my fault... ...which, being dried with grief, will break to powder and finish all foul thoughts O Antony, nobler than my revolt is infamous, forgive me in thine own particular But let the world rank me in register a master-leaver and a fugitive O Antony! O Antony! Their preparation is today by sea, yet they are not joined Swallows have built in Cleopatra's sails their nests. The augurs say they know not... ...they cannot tell, look grimly and dare not speak their knowledge Antony is valiant and dejected, and by starts his fretted fortunes... ...give him hope and fear of what he has and has not All is lost! This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me My fleet hath yielded to the foe... ...and yonder they cast their caps up and carouse together like friends long lost Triple-turned whore! 'Tis thou hast sold me to this novice... ...and my heart makes only wars on thee Bid them all fly. For when I am revenged upon my charm, I have done all Bid them all fly. Begone O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more Fortune and Antony part here. Even here do we shake hands - Ah, thou spell, avaunt! - Why is my lord enraged against his love? Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving and blemish Caesar's triumph Let him take thee and hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot of all thy sex Most monster-like be shown to poorest diminutives, to dolts And let patient Octavia plow thy visage up with her prepared nails 'Tis well thou art gone, if it be well to live But better 'twere thou fell'st into my fury, for one death might have prevented many The witch shall die To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall under this plot. She dies for it Help me, my women O, he's more mad than Telamon for his shield. The boar of Thessaly was never so embossed To the monument. There lock yourself and send him word you are dead The soul and body rive not more in parting than greatness going off To the monument. Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself Say that the last I spoke was 'Antony', and word it, prithee, piteously Hence, Mardian, and bring me how he takes my death To the monument Eros, thou yet beholdest me? Ay, noble lord Sometime we see a cloud that's dragonish, a vapour sometime like a bear or lion... A towered citadel, a pendent rock, a forked mountain, or blue promontory... ...with trees upon it that nod unto the world and mock our eyes with air Thou hast seen these signs, they are black vesper's pageants Ay, my lord That which is now a horse, even with a thought the rack dislimns... ...and makes it indistinct as water is in water - It does, my lord My good knave Eros, now thy captain is even such a body Here I am Antony, yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave I made these wars for Egypt, and the Queen, whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine Which whilst it was mine had annexed unto it a million more, now lost She, Eros, has packed cards with Caesar and false-played my glory unto an enemy's triumph Nay, weep not, gentle Eros. There is left us ourselves to end ourselves O, thy vile lady! She has robbed me of my sword No, Antony, my mistress loved thee and her fortunes mingled with thine entirely Hence, saucy eunuch, peace! She hath betrayed me and shall die the death Death of one person can be paid but once, and that she has discharged What thou wouldst do is done unto thy hand. The last she spake was 'Antony, most noble Antony' Then in the midst a tearing groan did break the name of Antony It was divided between her heart and lips. She rendered life thy name so buried in her - Dead, then? - Dead Unarm, Eros. The long day's task is done, and we must sleep That thou depart'st hence safe does pay thy labour richly. Go. Off, pluck off The sevenfold shield of Ajax cannot keep the battery from my heart O, cleave, my sides! Heart, once be stronger than thy continent Crack thy frail case. Apace, Eros, apace No more a soldier Bruised pieces, go. You have been nobly borne From me awhile I will overtake thee, Cleopatra, and weep for my pardon So it must be, for now the torch is out. Seal, then, and all is done Eros! I come, my queen Eros! Stay for me Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand, and with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops, and all the haunt be ours - Come, Eros, Eros! - What would my lord? Thou art sworn, Eros, that when the exigent should come, which now is come indeed... When I should see behind me the inevitable prosecution of disgrace and horror... ...that on my command thou then wouldst kill me. Do it. The time is come Thou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeatest. Put colour in thy cheek The gods withhold me! Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts, though enemy, lost aim and could not? Eros, wouldst thou be windowed in great Rome and see thy master thus with pleached arms... ...bending down his corrigible neck, his face subdued to penetrative shame? I would not see it - Come, then, for with a wound I must be cured Draw that thy honest sword... ...which thou hast worn most useful for thy country - O, sir, pardon me When I did make thee free, sworest thou not then to do this when I bade thee? Do it at once, or thy precedent services are all but accidents unpurposed Draw, and come Turn from me then that noble countenance wherein the worship of the whole world lies - Lo thee - My sword is drawn Then let it do at once the thing why thou hast drawn it My dear master, my captain, and my emperor, let me say, before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell - 'Tis said, man, and farewell - Farewell, great chief - Shall I strike now? - Now, Eros Why, there, then Thus I do escape the sorrow of Antony's death Thrice nobler than myself Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what I should and thou couldst not But I will be a bridegroom in my death and run into it as to a lover's bed Come then, and, Eros, thy master dies thy scholar. To do thus I learned of thee How, not dead? Not dead The guard, how? O, dispatch me! What's the noise? I have done my work ill, friend. O, make an end of what I have begun Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly This sword but shown to Caesar with this tidings shall enter us with him - Where's Antony? - There, Diomed, there Lives he? Wilt thou not answer, man? Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword, and give me sufficing strokes for death Most absolute lord, my mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee - When did she send thee? - Now, my lord - Where is she? - Locked in her monument She had a prophesying fear of what hath come to pass. For when she saw, which never shall be found... ...you did suspect she had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage would not be purged... ...she sent you word she was dead But fearing since how it might work, hath sent me to proclaim the truth And I am come, I dread, too late - Too late, good Diomed. Call my guard, I prithee What ho! The Emperor's guard! The guard, what ho! Come, your lord calls Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides. 'Tis the last service that I shall command you I have led you oft. Carry me now, good friends, and have my thanks for all O Charmian, I will never go from hence - Be comforted, dear madam - No, I will not All strange and terrible events are welcome, but comforts we despise Our size of sorrow, proportioned to our cause, must be as great as that which makes it - How now? Is he dead? - His death's upon him, but not dead O sun, burn the great sphere thou movest in. Darkling stand the varying shore of the world O Antony, Antony, Antony! Help me, Charmian! Help me, Iras! Let's draw him hither. Help, good friends below! Peace! Not Caesar's valour hath overthrown Antony, but Antony's hath triumphed on itself So it should be that none but Antony should conquer Antony, but woe 'tis so I am dying, Egypt, dying Only I here importune death awhile until of many thousand kisses the poor last I lay upon thy lips I dare not, dear, dear my lord, pardon, I dare not, lest I be taken But come, come, Antony. Help me, my women. We must draw thee up - Assist, good friends - O, quick, or I am gone Here's sport indeed. How heavy weighs my lord Our strength is all gone into heaviness, that makes the weight Had I great Juno's power, the strong-winged Mercury should fetch thee up and set thee by Jove's side Yet come a little. Wishers were ever fools. O, come, come, come And welcome, welcome Die where thou hast lived, quicken with kissing. Had my lips that power, thus would I wear them out I am dying, Egypt, dying. Give me some wine, and let me speak a little No, let me speak, and let me rail so high... ...that the false huswife Fortune break her wheel, provoked by my offence One word, sweet queen. Of Caesar seek your honour with your safety - They do not go together - Gentle, hear me None about Caesar trust but Proculeius My resolution and my hands I'll trust, none about Caesar The miserable change now at my end lament nor sorrow at But please your thoughts in feeding them with those my former fortunes Wherein I lived the greatest prince of the world, the noblest And do now not basely die, not cowardly put off my helmet to my countryman A Roman by a Roman valiantly vanquished Now my spirit is going. I can no more Noblest of men, woo't die? Hast thou no care of me? Shall I abide in this dull world, which in thy absence is no better than a sty? O see, my women, the crown of the earth doth melt My lord! O, withered is the garland of the war, the soldier's pole is fallen Young boys and girls are level now with men The odds is gone, and there is nothing left remarkable beneath the visiting moon O, quietness, lady She's dead, too, our sovereign. Royal Egypt, Empress! - O madam, madam, madam! - Peace, peace, Iras! No more but even a woman And commanded by such poor passion as the maid that milks and does the meanest chares It were for me to throw my sceptre at the injurious gods... ...to tell them that this world did equal theirs till they had stolen our jewel All's but naught Patience is sottish, and impatience does become a dog that's mad Then is it sin to rush into the secret house of death ere death dare come to us? How do you, women? What, what, good cheer Why, how now, Charmian? My noble girls Ah, women, women. Look, our lamp is spent, it's out. Come, away This case of that huge spirit now is cold Ah women, women! Come, we have no friend but resolution and the briefest end Go to him, Maecenas, bid him yield Being so frustrate, tell him, he mocks the pauses that he makes Caesar, I shall Wherefore is that? And what art thou that darest appear thus to us? I am called Ventidius Mark Antony I served, and wore my life to spend upon his haters If thou please to take me to thee, as I was to him I'll be to Caesar If thou pleasest not, I yield thee up my life - What is't thou sayest? - I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead The breaking of so great a thing should make a greater crack He is dead, Caesar, This is his sword I robbed his wound of it. Behold it stained with his most noble blood O Antony, I have followed thee to this, but we do lance diseases in our bodies I must perforce have shown to thee such a declining day or look on thine We could not stall together in the whole world But yet let me lament with tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts... That thou my brother, my competitor in top of all design, my mate in empire... Friend and companion in the front of war, the arm of mine own body... And the heart where mine his thoughts did kindle... ...that our stars unreconciliable should divide our equalness to this Hear me, good friends... But I will tell you at some meeter season Whence are you? The Queen my mistress, confined in her monument, of thy intents desires instruction That she preparedly may frame herself to the way she's forced to Bid her have good heart. She soon shall know of us, by some of ours... ...how honourable and how kindly we determine for her - For Caesar cannot live to be ungentle - May fortune pursue thee Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say we purpose her no shame Give her what comforts the quality of her passion shall require Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke she do defeat us For her life in Rome would be eternal in our triumph Go, and with your speediest bring us what she says... - ...and how you find of her - Caesar, I shall Go with me to my tent, where you shall see how hardly I was drawn into this war How calm and gentle I proceeded still in all my writings Go with me and see what I can show in this Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt And bids thee study on what fair demands thou meanest to have him grant thee - What's thy name? - My name is Proculeius Antony did tell me of you, bade me trust you But I do not greatly care to be deceived that have no use for trusting If your master would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him that majesty, to keep decorum... ...must no less beg than a kingdom. If he please to give me conquered Egypt for my son... ...he gives me so much of mine own as I will kneel to him with thanks Be of good cheer. You're fallen into a princely hand, fear nothing Make your full reference freely to my lord, who is so full of grace that it flows over on all that need Let me report to him your sweet dependency, and you shall find a conqueror... ...that will pray in aid for kindness where he for grace is kneeled to Pray you tell him I am his fortune's vassal and I give him the greatness he has got I hourly learn a doctrine of obedience, and would gladly look him in the face This I'll report, dear lady. Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied of him that caused it Guard her till Caesar come - Royal queen! - O, Cleopatra, thou art taken, queen! Quick, quick, good hands Hold, worthy lady, hold Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this relieved, but not betrayed What, of death, too, that rids our dogs of languish? Cleopatra, do not abuse my master's bounty by the undoing of yourself Let the world see his nobleness well acted, which your death will never let come forth Where art thou, Death? Come hither, come! Come, come, and take a queen worth many babes and beggars O, temperance, lady - Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir If idle talk will once be necessary, I'll not sleep neither This mortal house I'll ruin, do Caesar what he can Know, sir, that I will not wait pinioned at your master's court Nor once be chastised with the sober eye of dull Octavia Shall they hoist me up and show me to the shouting varletry of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt be gentle grave unto me Rather on Nilus' mud lay me stark naked, and let the waterflies blow me into abhorring Rather make my country's high pyramides my gibbet and hang me up in chains You do extend these thoughts of horror further than you shall find cause in Caesar Proculeius, what thou hast done thy master Caesar knows, and he hath sent for thee - For the Queen, I'll take her to my guard - Be gentle to her To Caesar I will speak what you shall please, if you'll employ me to him Say I would die - Most noble empress, you have heard of me - I cannot tell Assuredly you know me - No matter, sir, what I have heard or known You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams - Is it not your trick? - I understand not, madam I dreamt there was an emperor Antony O, such another sleep, that I might see but such another man - If it might please you... - His face was as the heavens And therein stuck a sun and moon, which kept their course... - ...and lighted the little O, the earth - Most sovereign creature... His legs bestrid the ocean, his reared arm crested the waves His voice was propertied as all the tuned spheres, and that to friends But when he meant to quail and shake the orb, he was as rattling thunder For his bounty, there was no winter in it. An autumn 'twas, that grew the more by reaping His delights were dolphin-like, they showed his back above the element they lived in In his livery walked crowns and crownets, realms and islands were as plates dropped from his pocket Think you there was, or might be, such a man as this I dreamt of? - Gentle madam, no - You lie up to the hearing of the gods But if there be nor ever were one such, it's past the size of dreaming Nature wants stuff to vie strange forms with fancy Yet to imagine an Antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy, condemning shadows quite Hear me, good madam. Your loss is as yourself, great, and you bear it as answering to the weight Would I might never overtake pursued success... ...but I do feel, by the rebound of yours, a grief that smites my very heart at root I thank you, sir - Know you what Caesar means to do with me? - I am loath to tell you what I would you knew - Nay, pray you, sir - Though he be honourable... - He'll lead me, then, in triumph - Madam, he will. I know it Which is the Queen of Egypt? It is the Emperor, madam Arise. You shall not kneel I pray you, rise. Rise, Egypt Sir, the gods will have it thus. My master and my lord I must obey Cleopatra, know we will extenuate rather than enforce If you apply yourself to our intents, which towards you are most gentle, you shall find a benefit in this change But if you seek to lay on me a cruelty by taking Antony's course... ...you shall bereave yourself of my good purposes And put your children to that destruction which I'll guard them from if thereon you rely - I'll take my leave - And may through all the world 'Tis yours, and we, your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall hang in what place you please Cleopatra, make not your thoughts your prisons. No, dear queen For we intend so to dispose you as yourself shall give us counsel. Feed and sleep Our care and pity is so much upon you that we remain your friend. And so adieu - My master and my lord - Not so. Adieu He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not be noble to myself. But hark thee, Charmian Finish, good lady. The bright day is done, and we are for the dark Hie thee again. I have spoke already, and it is provided - Go put it to the haste - Madam, I will Madam, Caesar through Syria intends his journey... ...and within three days you with your children will he send before Make your best use of this - Agrippa, I shall remain your debtor - I your servant Adieu, good queen. I must attend on Caesar - Farewell, and thanks Now, Iras, what thinkest thou? Thou an Egyptian puppet shall be shown in Rome as well as I - The gods forbid! - Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras Saucy lictors will catch at us like strumpets, and scald rhymers ballad us out of tune The quick comedians extemporally will stage us and present our Alexandrian revels Antony shall be brought drunken forth And I shall see some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness in the posture of a whore I'll never see it! For I am sure mine nails are stronger than mine eyes Why, that's the way to fool their preparation and to conquer their most absurd intents Now, Charmian! Show me, my women, like a queen Go fetch my best attires. I am again for Cydnus to meet Mark Antony Sirrah Iras, go. Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed And when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave to play till Doomsday Bring our crown and all - Wherefore's this noise? - Here is a rural fellow... ...that will not be denied your Highness' presence. He brings you figs Let him come in What poor an instrument may do a noble deed. He brings me liberty My resolution's placed, and I have nothing of woman in me Now from head to foot I am marble-constant. Now the fleeting moon no planet is of mine Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there that kills and pains not? Truly I have him, but I would not be the party that should desire you to touch him For his biting is immortal. Those that do die of it do seldom or never recover - Rememberest thou any that have died on it? - Very many, men and women too I heard of one of them no longer than yesterday. A very honest woman, but something given to lie... ...as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty How she died of the biting of it, what pain she felt. Truly, she makes a very good report of the worm But this is most falliable, the worm's an odd worm - Get thee hence. Farewell - I wish you all joy of the worm - Farewell - Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you... - ...for it is not worth the feeding - Will it eat me? You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a woman I know that a woman is a dish for the gods if the devil dress her not But truly these same whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women... ...for in every ten that they make, the devils mar five - Well, get thee gone. Farewell - Yes, forsooth I wish you joy of the worm Give me my robe Put on my crown I have immortal longings in me Now no more the juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip Yare, yare, good Iras, quick Methinks I hear Antony call. I see him rouse himself to praise my noble act I hear him mock the luck of Caesar, which the gods give men to excuse their after wrath Husband, I come. Now to that name my courage prove my title I am fire and air. My other elements I give to baser life So, have you done? Come then, and taste the last warmth of my lips Farewell, kind Charmian Iras, long farewell Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall? Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say the gods themselves do weep This proves me base. If she first meet the curled Antony... ...he'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss which is my heaven to have Come, thou mortal wretch With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate of life at once untie Poor venomous fool, be angry and dispatch - O eastern star - Peace, peace Dost thou not see my baby at my breast, that sucks the nurse asleep? - O, break, O, break! - As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle... O Antony Nay, I will take thee too What should I stay... ...in this vile world? So, fare thee well Now boast thee, Death, in thy possession lies a lass unparalleled Downy windows, close And golden Phoebus, never be beheld of eyes again so royal Your crown's awry. I'll mend it, and then play - Where's the Queen? - Speak softly. Wake her not - Caesar hath sent... - Too slow a messenger What work is here, Charmian? Is this well done? It is well done, and fitting for a princess descended of so many royal kings Ah, soldier! Caesar, thy thoughts touch their effects in this Thyself art coming to see performed the dreaded act which thou so soughtest to hinder O sir, you are too sure an augurer. That you did fear is done Bravest at the last, she leveled at our purposes and, being royal, took her own way The manner of their deaths? O Caesar, this Charmian lived but now, she stood and spake I found her trimming up the diadem on her dead mistress Tremblingly she stood, and on the sudden dropped She looks like sleep, as she would catch another Antony in her strong toil of grace A pair so famous High events as these strike those that make them And their story is no less in pity than his glory which brought them to be lamented Our army shall in solemn show attend this funeral, and then to Rome Come, Agrippa, see high order in this great solemnity
