STEPHEN: Well, come on! Oh! Come on, old man! Coming into Trinity Lane. Oh! [BELL DINGS] STEPHEN: Eyes on the road, Brian! Whoa! [LAUGHS] BRIAN: Brian spies an opening! A-ha! [CHUCKLES] Eyes on the staff! Hawking's lost it! Whoa! No! You lose, Brian. Too slow, old man. Too slow. Oh, my goodness. Right. [BREATHING HEAVILY] BRIAN: Time for a drink. STEPHEN: Hello. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oo-pah! [CHUCKLES] What if the secret of the universe had something to do with sex, huh? Maybe do your doctorate on that. The physics of love. STEPHEN: I think that's more your field, Brian. BRIAN: Oh, not lately. They will boot you out, you know, if you don't decide. I know everyone here who's... Brilliant. Oh, dear. Scientists. MAN 1: Ah, yes. MAN 2: Ah, you made it. Don't worry, we don't have to stay for long. Looks mortifyingly dull. Bores. Who's that? Who's who? Oh, him? Oh... He's strange. Clever. Goes to "Ban the Bomb" marches. Wilde. Jane Wilde. Oh, look, there's David. David! I'll be back in a minute. Diana! Diana! Hello. Hello. Science. Arts. English? French and Spanish. What about you? What are you... Oh, cosmologist, I'm a cosmologist. What's that? It's a kind of religion for intelligent atheists. Intelligent atheists? Mmm-hmm. You're not religious, are you? C of E. Church of England? England, yeah. [EXHALES] I suppose someone has to be. What do cosmologists worship, then? What do we worship? Mmm. One single unifying equation that explains everything in the universe. Really? Yes. What's the equation? That is the question. And a very good question. I'm not quite sure yet. But I intend to find out. JANE: Then why didn't you stay at Oxford? Because my finals exams were such a shambles that the examiners, they summoned me in for a viva and they told me that if I got a second... What's a viva? Oh, it's a sort of mildly terrifying face-to-face thingy. Like an interview? An interrogation. And I told them that if they gave me a second-class degree, then I would stay with them and do my research at Oxford. But if they gave me the first that I needed to get into Cambridge, then they would never have to see me again. They gave you the first. They gave me a first. Of course. This party is officially deceased. Come on, I fixed up a ride home. Come on, Jane. Jane. Well, it was lovely to talk to you. Yes. And I hope you find your equation. Yes. Oh. Ah. Bye. STEPHEN: Bye. [DOOR CLOSES] [DOOR OPENS] Stephen? Oh. Yeah. [DOOR CLOSES] Well, then, here we are. A little challenge for you all, as you embark upon your separate doctoral journeys, whatever they may be, Mr. Hawking. Pass them down. Something to separate the men from the boys, the wheat from the chaff, the mesons from the pi mesons, the quarks from the quacks. Ten questions, each more impregnable than the last. Good luck. You'll need it. Shall we say Friday, 3:00? This is going to hospitalize me. And, one. Drive! Two. Drive! [GRUNTING] Three. Drive! Stay long, Brian. BRIAN: I'll give you something long. Stay long, Brian! Keep long, Brian! BRIAN: Shut up! Long, Brian! BRIAN: I'm exhausted! Stay long, Brian! [YELLS] [BELL DINGS] BRIAN: Flip it. Flip it, Wiggs. [BRIAN LAUGHS] ELLIS: Somebody else, for once. Can I get two more of those, please? BARTENDER: Yeah, sure. And some change for the payphone. Yeah. Steve, you all right, mate? DIANA: Jane. No, of course, Timothy turned out to be an absolute cad. I mean, you'll never guess who I saw him with the other day. Caroline! For heaven's sake, she can have him, quite frankly. What's the probability? Reasonably low. Um... This is... This is Stephen. Do you play croquet? JANE: Croquet? Not recently. Sunday morning. JANE: Actually busy Sunday mornings. Oh. Him. Okay. DIANA: Anyway, before I was completely interrupted... Come on, get up! How many did you get? Morning, Brian. Good afternoon, Stephen. How many of the impossible questions did you do? Brian, I have no idea what you're talking about. How many of Sciama's questions did you get, Stephen? None. You didn't get any? I was going to do them later. You haven't even looked at them. No. Stephen, are you aware that you have voluntarily embarked upon a PhD in physics, at the most prestigious college in England? Yes. Oh. I thought maybe you'd slept through the induction or something. Bri? What? Can you whip on some Wagner? Oh, sod off. [OPERA MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT TALKING] [SIGHS] [GROANS] [KNOCK ON DOOR] Come in, Stephen. Sorry. Michael, that's so illegible, I can't quite decipher how wrong it is. I suspect enormously. And, Brian, that's just baffling. Have you even bothered, Stephen? Oh, sorry. Uh... SCIAMA: Right. Train timetables. STEPHEN: Ah. That's totally unacceptable. These expired a month ago. It's on the back, I had a little accident. Ah. I could only do nine. SCIAMA: Lord. Oh, thank God. Bravo. [MOUTHING] Nine? SCIAMA: Come in. Ah, Stephen, take a seat. [DOOR CLOSES] I wanted to talk to you about your subject. We're all rather concerned as to what it's going to be. I can't decide. Do you have any ideas? No. So, this is where J.J. Thomson discovered the electron, and where Rutherford split the atom. You know, one of the great rewards of this job is one never knows from where the next great leap forward is going to come, or from whom. Listen, next Friday, I'm taking a few graduates of merit to London to attend a talk by the mathematician Roger Penrose. Do come along, if you're interested. Oh, close the door as you leave. [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] [INDISTINCT TALKING] So, I gather you've never been to church. Once upon a time. Tempted to convert? I have a slight problem with the whole "celestial dictator" premise. Now, what are you doing for lunch? Ma makes a cracking roast. Ah, so, Jane, what are you studying? Arts. Spuds? Thank you. Um, French and Spanish. I'm hoping to do a PhD eventually. Oh, what on? Medieval poetry of the Iberian Peninsula. FRANK: Medieval poets? What painters do you like? Well, I like Turner. Mmm. Turner, really? I always feel that his paintings look as if they've been left out in the rain. Oh. STEPHEN: Pa. And William Blake. FRANK: Thank you, Mother. Oh, good heavens, surely not. FRANK: Jane, have some of my elderflower wine. Oh, yes, thank you. STEPHEN: Don't touch it. Don't touch it, Jane. Thank you. Mother? Stephen doesn't like my home-made wine. Philistine. I'm going to send you back with a couple of bottles. So, Stephen, you have come from church with a good woman. Are you feeling holier than thou? Positively saintly. Thank you. You haven't said why you don't believe in God. A physicist can't allow his calculations to be muddled by a belief in a supernatural creator. Sounds less of an argument against God than against physicists. Light or dark? Jane, light meat or dark? Oh, light, please. I'm inviting Jane to be my partner to the May Ball. FRANK: Really? Ah. PHILIPPA: Very impressive. ISOBEL: You'll have to dance this year, Stephen. [PHILIPPA CHUCKLES] FRANK: Make way for Mother's leg. Here we go. Hello. Hello. [MUSIC PLAYING] Ooh. Sorry. You okay? Yeah. Do you dance, Stephen? No. [BOTH LAUGH] No. I don't dance. It's a phenomenon I'm very happy to observe but I can't possibly imagine participating. I absolutely agree. I mean, who would want to dance? No, I'm serious. I don't dance. No dancing, then. You see how the men's shirtfronts and their bow ties how they glow more than the women's dresses? JANE: Yes. Do you know why? Why? Tide. The washing powder? The fluorescence in the washing powder is caught by the UV light. Why do you know that? When stars are born and when they die, they emit UV radiation. So if we could see the night sky in the ultraviolet light, then almost all the stars would disappear and all that we would see are these spectacular births and deaths. I reckon it would look a little... Like that. [ALL CHEERING] [WHOOPING] Wow! Oh! Did you see? Like those. Like those ones... [ALL CHEERING] [BAND PLAYING] Why? Why what? Why Spanish medieval poetry? I suppose I like to time-travel. Like you. Are there any particular time periods that you like to visit? I imagine the Twenties was fun. The Roaring Twenties. "Seek, then," "No learning from starry men," "Who follow with the optic glass" "The whirling ways of stars that pass" [CHUCKLES] Bravo. [CHUCKLES] [BAND PLAYING] Well, that's astonishing, isn't it? [JANE SIGHS] "In the beginning was the Heaven and the Earth." "And the Earth was without form," "and darkness" "was upon the face of the deep." Will you dance with me? [BAND PLAYING] MAN: [OVER PA] The train now departing from platform 3 is the nine-seventeen service to London King's Cross. [TRAIN HORN HOOTING] Come on, Stephen. Get a move on. What's wrong with you, man? Chop-chop. [TRAIN HORN HOOTING] A star, more than 3 times the size of our sun, ought to end its life how? With a collapse. The gravitational forces of the entire mass overcoming the electromagnetic forces of individual atoms and so collapsing inwards. If the star is massive enough, it will continue this collapse, creating a black hole, where the warping of space-time is so great that nothing can escape. Not even light. It gets smaller. Smaller. The star, in fact, gets denser as atoms, even subatomic particles, get literally crushed into smaller and smaller space. And at its end point, what are we left with? A space-time singularity. Space and time come to a stop. [INDISTINCT TALKING] I wonder what would happen if you applied Penrose's theory about black holes to the entire universe. If Einstein is right or if general relativity is correct, then the universe is expanding, yes? Yes. Okay. So,... ...if you reverse time, then the universe is getting smaller. All right. So,... ...what if I reverse the process all the way back, to see what happened at the beginning of time itself? Beginning of time itself? Yes. The universe, getting smaller and smaller, getting denser and denser, hotter and hotter as we... You mean wind back the clock? Exactly. Wind back the clock. Wind back the clock. Is that what you're doing? Are you winding back the clock? That is what I'm doing. STEPHEN: Well, keep winding. And you've got quite a long way to go. Keep winding. JANE: I don't want to fall in. You've got to get back to the beginning of time. You've got a long way to go. Keep winding. Keep winding until you get... A singularity? Space-time singularity. So, the universe born from a black hole exploding. Keep going. What do you mean, "Keep going"? Before the universe began? No, no, no. Keep going, develop the mathematics. [FLATLINING] [INAUDIBLE] [COT SQUEAKING] DOCTOR: Okay, all right, very good. Push it as hard as you can. Push it. Push it. As hard as you can. STEPHEN: I am pushing as hard as I can. Why... Come on. One, two... Why won't it... All right, all right. Fourth finger, fourth peg. DOCTOR: It's called motor neuron disease. It's a progressive neurological disorder that destroys the cells in the brain that control essential muscle activity, such as speaking, walking... ...breathing, swallowing. The signals that muscles must receive in order to move are disrupted. The result is gradual muscle decay. Wasting away. Eventually, the ability to control voluntary movement is lost. Entirely. I'm afraid average life expectancy is two years. There's nothing I can do for you. What about the brain? The brain isn't affected. Your thoughts won't change, it's just that... Well, eventually, no one will know what they are. I'm ever so sorry. [BELL TOLLING] MAN: Hello, Brian. [OPERA MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCK ON DOOR] [MUSIC TURNS OFF] Welcome to this week's episode of The Natural World, where this week we explore the bizarre hibernation patterns of the rare Cambridge physicist seen here in his remarkable plumage. So how was it? What did they say? How's your wrist? I have a disease, Bri. Is it venereal, Stephen? [CHUCKLES] I have motor neuron disease. [STUTTERS] Sorry, I don't... It's Lou Gehrig's disease. He was a baseball player. Sorry, I'm lagging behind in my pioneering research into obscure, motor, baseball-related diseases. I have two years to live. Sorry? It does sound odd when you say it out loud, doesn't it? You... What do you mean? You don't. [STAMMERING] What did they say? Sorry, I don't really, um... Will you go, Bri? Stephen, sorry, I was just being a berk. No, it's not... [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Will you go? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Stephen, phone for you. It's a girl. Um... I'll see you soon. I'll... Yes. She's waiting. [DIAL TONE] Stephen? [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Nobody's seen him for a while. I suppose, you know... Jane. Jane. Brian, hello. Sorry. Um... Why don't you... Why don't you sit down? I'm so sorry. I spoke to Stephen yesterday, and I know that you called him... [CONTINUES TALKING] [TV PLAYING] Something educational? Very. John is having an affair with Martha. But... Martha is in love with Alan, and I think that Alan is probably a homosexual by the look of his jumper. So... Well, I'm just trying to work out the mathematical probability of happiness. Are you close? Some integer of zero, but no, not quite there yet. Stephen. You just missed him, he was here earlier. JANE: Don't do this. Go. Croquet. Play a game with me. Go. If you don't get up and play a game with me, I won't come back here again. Ever. Come on. [JANE SOBBING] Leave me now. Are you going to talk about this or not? Will you just go? Is that what you want? Yes, it is what I want. So, please, if you car about me at all, then please just go. I can't. I have two years to live. I need to work. I love you. That's a false conclusion. I want us to be together for as long as we've got and if that's not very long, well, then that's just how it is. It'll have to do. You don't know what's coming. It'll affect everything. [EXHALES] Your glasses are always dirty. [CHUCKLES] There. That's better, isn't it? Yes. Yes, it is. SCIAMA: Now the solutions to the Schrodinger equation must vanish at the boundary of the box and so we have... Time. Oh, time, that's your subject? Any aspect in particular? Time. Come in, come in. [CLEARS THROAT] I... I don't think you realize what lies ahead, Jane. His life is going to be very short. So, be careful. The weight of science is against you and this will not be a fight, Jane. This is going to be a very heavy defeat. For all of us. I know what you all think. That... That I don't look like a terribly strong person. But I love him and he loves me. We're going to fight this illness together. All of us. [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [GRUNTING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] 2, 3... [BOTH GRUNTING] Good luck. Morning, Stephen. Morning, Professor. SCIAMA: I know, I know. THORNE: It could be a little bit more elegant. SCIAMA: Yes, but I... [KNOCKING] Come in, Stephen. [INDISTINCT TALKING] SCIAMA: I know it's something we were all worried about initially, but I... I knew, Roger... You had some reservations about it in the early days. Yes, but it's not uncommon in any theory. Yes. Absolutely. Very well, very well. We'll see. SCIAMA: Welcome, Stephen. Morning. Would you like to take a seat? No, I'm fine. Thank you. SCIAMA: You're sure? Yeah. So,... Stephen, in summary, as we know, chapter 1, full of holes, lacks mathematical support. Professor Thorne? Chapter 2, not really original. Uses a lot of Roger's ideas. Well, at least you run with them. Chapter 3, too many unanswered questions. SCIAMA: I agree. And then, of course, we have chapter 4. This black hole at the beginning of time. Space-time singularity. Indeed. It's brilliant. Brilliant, Stephen. Superb. Therefore, all there is to say is well done. Or perhaps I should say, to be more precise, well done, Doctor. PEN ROSE: Bravo, Stephen. SCIAMA: An extraordinary theory. Thank you. So, what next? Prove it. To prove with a single equation that time has a beginning. Wouldn't that be nice, Professor? The one simple, elegant equation to explain everything. Yes, it would. It would indeed. Thank you. JANE: To the esteemed and formidable Doctor... Who? [ALL LAUGHING] Doctor Stephen Hawking. ALL: Doctor Stephen Hawking. Thank you. It is astonishing he's the first person to receive his doctorate bearing in mind how little work he's been doing. [ALL LAUGHING] BRIAN: Work was the worst four-letter word for Stephen. At Oxford especially, he averaged an hour. An hour a day, he averaged. And now, here he is, the esteemed man. Astonishing levels of sloth. CARTER: I've got... On the theme of sloth, Brian, how many of your lectures have I covered in the last six months? When you've been doing research trips up to the Lake District. BRIAN: Absolutely, completely... ELLIS: So have I! CARTER: How many? BRIAN: Four. [INDISTINCT TALKING] Everything all right? All good. I'm fine. [ALL LAUGHING] What can you do? Would you like kartoffel? Oh, please. [BREATHING HEAVILY] ELLIS: Business or pleasure? JANE: Ah, for pleasure. [ALL LAUGHING] [GRUNTING] [PANTING] [GRUNTS] Hey, Robbie. [PANTING] It's okay, Robbie. [GRUNTING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [SNIFFLES] [SLURPS] [CUTLERY CLATTERING] [SIGHS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [SIGHS] This is temporary. Of course. [CHUCKLES] Well, it's convenient for breakfast. [LAUGHS] Thank you. [INHALES SHARPLY] Sorry, did you say something? I said... Yes? ...thank you. [WHISPERING] There we go, Lucy. [COOING] There we go. [MUMBLING] There we go. Have you got her? She looks like you. [STEPHEN CHUCKLING] JANE: Oh, no. Oh, wait. Go, Jane. [CHUCKLES] I'll be one second. Luce! Lucy. [LAUGHING] Jane? JANE: Oh, Stephen. Oh. Hello... [CHUCKLES] [BREATHING HEAVILY] I've got an idea. Jane... Jane, I've had an idea. Hello. Hello, Dennis. Hello, Dennis. How are you? Okay. Good luck. SCIAMA: He'll be fine. He'll be fine. Oops. Sorry. No problem. [DOOR CLOSES] Allowing us to predict that some particles can, in fact, escape a black hole. So, black holes are not, in fact, black at all, but glow with heat radiation. The steady emission of heat energy causes the black holes to lose mass and eventually they disappear in a spectacular explosion. It's very, very simple, in the way that a body loses heat. Second law of thermodynamics. BRIAN: Right, it's thermodynamics. [STUTTERING] If we can imagine that a black hole is, indeed, losing particles and over time, will diminish in size, it will evaporate, it will... Disappear. So first a star vanishes into a black hole. And then the black hole itself vanishes. Gone, nothing. From nothing to nothing! You owe me another beer. I have just shown you that our friend has proven that time, indeed, has a beginning. Not only that, how the universe was born, and... How it will end. Bang! Crunch! It's beautiful, it's racy, it's... Complete nonsense! It's preposterous! Was it something I said, Professor? Uh, excuse me. My name is Professor Khalatnikov from the Soviet Academy of Science. As you know, my field is evolution of the hot universe, the properties of the microwave background radiation and the theory of black holes. To be honest, I came here today expecting to hear a lot of nonsense. I go home disappointed. The little one here has done it! [MURMURING] He has done it! [ALL APPLAUDING] It is a pleasure to meet you, Professor. Entirely my pleasure. My pleasure. STEPHEN: Thank you. PROFESSOR: Well done, Stephen. STEPHEN: Well, that went pretty well, all things considered. SCIAMA: I was worried for a while. [LAUGHING] Hawking radiation! The little one has done it! The little one has done it! [INDISTINCT YELLING] Hey, come on, genius! BRIAN: Oh, very funny! [CHUCKLING] You've had enough of that, old man. Come on, codger. One, two, three! [GROANING] My God! How does Jane manage? Stephen, your motor-mouth disease, does it affect, um... What? Uh, everything? What? No. Different system. Automatic. Are you serious? Well, that's pretty wonderful, isn't it? Well, it certainly explains a lot about men. [BOTH LAUGHING] STEPHEN: Hurry up! [CHUCKLING] Come on! [GROANING] [CHUCKLING] Please. What is it? It's a surprise. Right. Keep them closed. JANE: Ta-da! Look, Daddy, look! JANE: That is an electric wheelchair. If you don't like it, we can take it back. SCIAMA: I don't understand. You've spent years assuming black holes exist and you believe Cygnus X-1 could well turn out to be the first black hole that we can actually observe. And yet, you've bet Kip Thorne it's not a black hole. Yes. What did you bet him? A one-year subscription to a magazine. Which magazine? Nature? No. Penthouse. Penthouse? Gonna get you! [STEPHEN GROANING] ROBERT: Daddy, look out! Let's get Mummy! STEPHEN: Come on... ROBERT: Gonna get you. Mummy, Mummy! Come and look! [CLATTERING AND CLANKING] We're gonna get you. STEPHEN: Come on. [CLATTERING AND BANGING] ROBERT AND LUCY: Holiday! Holiday! Holiday... STEPHEN: Holiday! Holiday... FRANK: Hello! Hello! Hello. There you are. Hello, Pa! Isn't it marvelous? What about these steps, Frank? FRANK: Lucy! Steps are nothing, Jane. Stephen! Here we are! STEPHEN: Hello! Yes, here we go. Once we're up at the top, it's very snug. Hello, Stephen. Hello. There we go. Turn you around, Stephen. Want me to pull? No, no, I'll be fine. You get the luggage. Here we go. Off we go. Let's go. I'll lift it up. [FRANK GRUNTING] There we are, you see? Quite easy. And up one, there we go. ISOBEL: Shimmering? FRANK: Um, uh, the... Oh, rain coming down, shivering cold? Cold? Uh, no, the falling. Falling... Um... Ooh! Very cold. What is it? [CHOKING] I'm having a jolly... Okay, take Lucy. One minute. Oh. What is it? [STEPHEN CHOKING] Ah... Is it out? Some water. No, don't worry. [SIGHING] Okay, that's it. There we go. [STEPHEN SNORTING] It's okay. It's okay. He needs to see a specialist. Keeps happening over and over again. Ridiculous. STEPHEN: No doctors. No doctors. FRANK: All right, no doctors. [SNORTING AND GASPING] FRANK: A little water. [SNIFFLING] [SNIFFLING] Stephen. I need help. If only for Robert. He's missing out on his childhood. I keep looking for a way to make this work, but I can't find it on my own. STEPHEN: Everything is fine. We're just a normal family. We're not a normal family. We're not a normal family! Robert. Your mother is very angry with me. [SIGHING] Thanks. [SIGHING] Jane. Jane, stop. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Sit. [LIQUID POURING] Now, [LIQUID POURING] I'd like to make a suggestion. Might sound a bit unusual, but I have seen it work wonders. I think that you should consider joining the church choir. [CHUCKLING] Mum, I think that's possibly the most English thing anyone has ever said. Maybe so. I used to love singing. You're very good at it. I don't know about that. Just go. It's one hour a week. [SINGING IN LATIN] Really lovely, everyone. Okay. See you next week. Bye-bye. Goodbye. Hello. Hello. Have you come to sing? Um... I just came to, um... Soprano? Mezzo. Ah! Lovely, just what we need. Where have you been hiding? Good question. Well, you're here now and just in time, as they say. Oh, you know, I have to come back anyway, so... Good. You have everything? Yes, thank you. Yes. Thank you for coming. You will be a valuable asset. Thank you. Well, I should be going. And if your son wants those piano lessons, just... Yes, yes, absolutely. I, um... Call me. I will do. Great. My husband adores music, too. Oh, well, I could... Does he play? I could teach him as well. That's a long story. But, um... Ah, okay. Well, thank you, Jonathan. My pleasure, Jane. See you again. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. [PIANO PLAYING] Third finger. No, that... That one, there. Try lifting your wrists a little bit. Keep your elbows back. Try again. ROBERT: No. Good. Yeah. JANE: Wine? Why not? Thank you. Stephen? No. [JONATHAN CLEARING THROAT] Stephen, Jane was telling me that you have a beautiful theorem. That proves that the universe had a beginning. Is that it? That was my PhD thesis. My new project disproves it. Uh, disproves it? Oh. Yes. so then you no longer believe in the creation? What one believes is irrelevant in physics. "Irrelevant in physics." Oh. I see. Stephen's done a U-turn. The big new idea is that the universe has no boundaries at all. No boundaries, no beginning. And no God. Oh. Oh, I see. I... I thought that you'd proved the universe had a beginning and thus a need for a creator. My mistake. No, mine. Stephen is looking for a single theory that explains all the forces in the universe. Therefore, God must die. Oh, why must God die? I don't see. The two great pillars of physics are quantum theory, the laws that govern the very small particles, electrons and so on, and general relativity. Ah, yes, Einstein. Einstein's theory, the laws that govern the very large planets and such. But quantum and relativity... Don't tell me. They're different? They don't remotely play by the same rules. If the world were all potatoes, then, easy. You could trace a precise beginning as Stephen once did. A moment of creation. Hallelujah. God lives. If you incorporate peas into the menu, well, then it all goes a little... Tits up. Yes. Haywire. It just all becomes a godless mess. Oh, dear. Einstein hated peas. Quantum theory. He said, "God doesn't play dice with the universe." STEPHEN: Seems he not only plays dice, but he throws them where we can't find them. God is back on the endangered species list. Well, I expect he'll cope. And physics is back in business. JANE: Yes. Physics is back in business. I was married actually. But, sadly, she passed. Almost a year ago now. [EXHALING] It was leukemia. She fought it and I nursed her. But, uh,... ...in the end... I do get quite lonely. The tyranny of the empty room and all that. But music is my salvation. Teaching and playing. Not really as a career, but I'm not very ambitious. Though that's not... [SIGHING] Is that a sin? I don't know. Wrong man to ask. Thank you so much for having me. Thank you for coming. It was really, really wonderful. If there's anything I can do to be of service to you, to the family I mean, I would consider it a privilege. I have no children or commitments, so... I only mean that if I could be of help. I believe I might find a purpose that would help alleviate my own situation. Good night. Night. I understand if you need help. If someone is prepared to offer it, I won't object. [LAUGHING] Chilly? Yeah, it's very bracing. Come on. Ready? Yeah. All right. 17, 18... There we go. Right. I'm going to put the kettle on. [PIANO PLAYING] Calls you one and calls you all To gain his everlasting hall Christ was born to save JONATHAN: Great, lovely, okay. We can go. Just gone 7:45. Could you leave your copies? Goodbye. There's something I need to tell you. What? I'm pregnant. [CHUCKLES] Gosh, I assumed that you and Stephen, um... Well, that's really wonderful. It is. Yes, wonderful. Congratulations, Jane. Thank you. Everyone say, "Cheese." Ready? On the count of 3. 1, 2, 3. ALL: Cheese! Cheese. JANE: Is that your brother? On his bike? LUCY: Mummy! Just coming. Oh, come on, sweetie. Come on... Now, you know I've always been supportive of your choice not to have home help, but... ...we need to find a permanent solution. This... ...situation cannot continue. You need to have a proper live-in nurse immediately. We have help. Look, you know what I'm talking about. We can't afford a live-in nurse. Stephen, you need to find a way for your family's sake. You're world-famous. For black holes, not for rock concerts. Stephen, this isn't funny. I believe it's urgent. [WATER RUSHING] We do have a right to know. We have a right to know, Jane. Know what? ISOBEL: Whose child Timothy is. Stephen's or Jonathan's. That's what you think of me. There's no way that Timothy could have any other father than Stephen. None. [DOOR CLOSING] Jonathan. Please don't go. I have to go. Come on. Everyone is talking... So, what does it matter? It's difficult for me because I'm just trying to help. I know you're trying to help, and your help is valued. The best thing for me right now is... I think maybe if... I just step back for now. I think really.... Please, Jonathan. We need you. The children need you and I need you, and Stephen needs you. Jonathan. There's other things as well. Jane, I... [SIGHING] I have feelings for you. And I have feelings for you too. Thank you, Jane. I've been invited to the Bordeaux Opera. Invited where? Bordeaux. To Bordeaux? Wagner. The students can take me. I know you hate flying. [CHUCKLING] I do hate to fly. Bring the car. Meet me in Bordeaux. Take the children camping. It'll be too difficult to manage, Stephen. Bring Jonathan. I doubt he would be willing. [DOOR OPENING] Hello, Stephen. Is this okay? Well... I won't tell if you won't. Just... ...bearing in mind you have to drive. [LAUGHING] Jane needs help. Sarah, you won't forget a vitamin B injection... ...as soon as you land. No. Of course. You'll call me when you get to the hotel? I will. Yes? Promise? Good. Yes. Stephen. Mum will take the baby. She'll be here any minute. See you in Bordeaux. And be good. Are they asleep? [WHISPERING] Yeah. [CHUCKLING] Okay. It's okay. I'm all right. We've done rather well. Right. Children? Get your sleeping bags. Thank you. [GIGGLING] Thank you. Thanks. [FASTENING ZIPPER] [BREATHING HEAVILY] Jonathan? [GRUNTING] [CHOKING] PERSON: Shh! [COUGHING] Oh, God! Excuse me, sorry. Jonathan? Jonathan. Stephen's been taken ill. He's in hospital and Yeah, he's in a coma. Stephen's been taken ill? [EQUIPMENT BEEPING] What are you talking about? This way would be a painless end. If we try to bring him round from the anesthetic, it's not sure he will survive resuscitation. You have to bring him round from the anesthetic. Are you sure it's what you want? The only way of weaning him off the ventilator will be to give him a tracheotomy. A hole in the neck, bypassing the throat. He will never speak again. There's no question. Stephen must live. I will see he gets everything he needs. I will have him transferred back to Cambridge. He may not survive the journey. Yes, he will. I know. I'll... step back. Did you get everything in the car? His chair and his equipment and everything? [MOUTHS] [ENGINE STARTING] Goodbye. [CHATTERING] Stephen? This is a spelling board. Firstly, you tell me what letter you want by blinking when I say the color of the group that contains the letter. Once I know the group, you can choose the character inside that group by blinking again when I say the color of each letter within that group. Apparently. Let's just try. Green. Blue. Pink. Black. Red. Blink to choose the color of the group of the letter you want, Stephen. Green. Blue. Pink. Black. Red. [DOOR OPENS] ELAINE: Hello. JANE: Hello, Elaine. JANE: Shall I take your coat? Okay. Thank you, Jane. Just wait here. Great. She's here. She comes highly recommended. Promise not to eat her alive. Okay? Here we are. Elaine, Stephen. Stephen, Elaine. Lovely to meet you, Professor. Now, you should have everything you need. But if there's anything else, I'll be just next door. Great. I think we'll get straight to work. Thank you, Jane. Oh, if you close the doors. Of course. [CLEARS THROAT] ELAINE: Get started, then. Okay. Red. Yellow. T. Green. Black. E. Green, green. A. Tea. You want a cup of tea. Okay. Any preference? You've memorized the board, I know you have. I haven't got all day. Green, green. Green, yellow. Yellow. B. Green, blue, pink, black, red. Red. Green, yellow, blue, blue. U. So, B, U. Oh. Builder's tea, right? [LAUGHS] So, how did you get on? You know... I think he's the most brilliant man I've ever met. You're very lucky. Thank you. You must worship the ground beneath... His wheels? And he's a perfect patient. He's so funny! When you read about him... Let's see how you get on, shall we, Elaine? TECHNICIAN: That's tightened up. As you can see, it's height-adjustable and we can change the angle to whatever Steve wants it at. You know, it's cutting-edge. JANE: So, how does it work? It uses a very simple interface that scans through the alphabet, selects each letter one at a time. I mean, using this technique, the Professor can expect to write about 4 words per minute. Good. Better than one a minute. Yes, and what I've done is taken the components from a telephone answering system actually to convert the written text into synthesized speech. I mean, the voice sounds a little bit robotic, but shall we give it a try? Great. Here's the clicker. JANE: Right hand? TECHNICIAN: There you go. Welcome to the future. [STEPHEN SPEAKING THROUGH MECHANIZED VOICE] It's American. Is that a problem? Oh, my goodness. Well, is there another voice? That's the only one they have at the moment. I think it's great. [LAUGHS] [CLICKING] [STEPHEN SPEAKING] Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn. Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate. I will write a book. About what? [CLICKING] Time. [STEPHEN SPEAKING] What is the nature of time? Will it ever come to an end? [SPEAKING] Someday, these answers may seem as obvious to us as the Earth orbiting the sun, or perhaps as ridiculous as a tower of tortoises. Only time, whatever that may be, will tell. Professor? [CLICKING QUICKLY] It is for a friend. Of course it is. That's what they all say. You don't have to be embarrassed in front of me, Professor. I know what men are like. Shall we take a look? There you go. [CLEARS THROAT] [DOOR OPENS] Oh! I'm sorry. Next one? What? STEPHEN: So I said, "I have long been looking for a model of the universe." "I finally found her." I bet you did. [LAUGHING] Stephen, I need to steal you. The contract's arrived. Could you just give us a minute, please, Jane? There we go. Like new. [ELAINE CHUCKLES] "Who are we?" "Why are we here?" "If we ever learn this," "it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason," "for then we would know the mind of God." Do you mean this? Yes. Of course. So, you're acknowledging him? However... "However" what? Are you actually going to let me have this moment? You are welcome. I have asked Elaine to travel with me to America. She will look after me. Will she? Yes. You always used to tell me when an invitation came in. Another award. What can you do? I am sorry. How many years? They said two. You've had so many. [SOBS] Everything will be okay. I have loved you. I did my best. [SOBS] Careful. That... That's staying. All right. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Bye, Jonathan. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [PIANO MUSIC STARTS] [REPORTERS CLAMORING] WOMAN: Professor, I love your book! [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] Thank you. I first met the Professor in 1963. Now there you are. Time! Where does it go? It has been one of the great joys of my life to watch this man defy every expectation, both scientific and personal. Please welcome onto the stage my esteemed colleague, my dear friend, Professor Hawking. [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] Thank you. Could we please have the first pre-selected question? Thank you. Can you hear me? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Now you are recognized everywhere. How do you deal with all the attention? I was stopped recently by a tourist in Cambridge, who asked if I was the real Stephen Hawking. I replied I was not and said the real one was much better looking. In 1979, you talked about the possibility of a theory of everything being discovered before the end of the century. I now predict that I was wrong. Professor Hawking, you have said you do not believe in God. Do you have a philosophy of life that helps you? [FADES OFF] You have said you do not believe in God. Do you have a philosophy of life that helps you? It is clear that we are just an advanced breed of primates on a minor planet orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among 100 billion galaxies. But, ever since the dawn of civilization, people have craved for an understanding of the underlying order of the world. There ought to be something very special about the boundary conditions of the universe. And what can be more special than that there is no boundary... And there should be no boundary to human endeavor. We are all different. However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. While there is life, there is hope. [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] That came. It's from Stephen. Gosh. Your glasses are always dirty. EQUERRY: Professor and Mrs. Hawking, Her Majesty the Queen. Congratulations... My Companion of Honour. Not bad for an old liberal socialist. Don't worry, you can decline the knighthood. Thank you for today. It was extraordinary. It's all been rather extraordinary though, hasn't it? [CLICKING] What are you writing? Look what we made.
