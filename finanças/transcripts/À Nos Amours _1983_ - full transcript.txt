"Don't you think one can die of love? "You told me you loved me... "What kind of a world is this? "You must despise women who take you as you are, "who dismiss their lovers to seduce you, "with another's kiss on their lips." "You must despise women who take you as you are, "who dismiss their lovers to seduce you, "with another's kiss on their lips." It still needs a little work. It's not quite right yet. Want to come on the boat? She really shouldn't... I only have the boat for a day. We'll go to a great island. Coming? I'll bring you back this evening. You'll be hot in all that. We're waiting. Hurry and undress. Be back tonight. You must, and early or we're in trouble. Summer camps are still strict. They're going to eat now. Come on, Suzanne! I'll bring her back. You have the play. I'll rehearse on the boat. Look at her! My sister's beautiful. Not now... You don't know your lines. You're proud! Better watch out! You're 16 and you don't believe in love. Do you? Rent the boat for long? "There's No Trifling With Love." "We played with life and death, but our heart is pure. "Don't kill Rosette, I'll make it up to her. "She's young, she'll be rich and happy. "Well, Camille, what is it?" "She's dead. Farewell, Perdican..." You can't say it that way. After all it's... Look at that little house. Got stage fright? "My God! When I came, "I swore to be true to you. "Why did you desert me? "Why do you make truth itself lie? "I can beg no more." "Pride! "Why come between that girl and me? "She could have loved me... "We were made for each other." "Who followed me? Who's that talking? "Is it you, Perdican?" "We're mad! "We love each other... "Which of us is the cheat? "Life is so cruel... and happiness a rare pearl, "In this sea of a world. "Like the children we are, "we made a toy of it. "We're in love." "Yes, we're in love. "And the God watching us won't object. "He approves of my loving you. He's known of it for 15 years." "Camille... "You're mine. "Rosette's voice!" "Oh God... "Don't make me a murderer! "We're mad children playing with life and death. "But don't kill Rosette! "I'll find her a husband, make it up to her. "She's young, she'll be rich... and happy. "What is it?" "She's dead. "Farewell, Perdican." What are you doing? Listen... I brought you some chow, and Charline's dessert. It's a little squashed... because of all the walking. And Charline? She's at the port. How about Solange? They're all at the port. It's dumb that camp rules don't let us swim. What if they saw us! Coming? We're fine here, aren't we? What's the matter? You're tired of me. What do you mean? You're in a sweat. It's not really nice here, is it? I can tell I bother you. No, you don't. But I'm sick of hiding too. Don't you see? If we're caught... I don't see you enough. Is there another guy? Idiot! You know there isn't. It's not my fault... I can't get out. You know the camp rules. I'm uncomfortable. What is it? It's beautiful! I'll have to get back. It won't stay on. So cut your hair! Just for that? Look how short mine is. I noticed. You're beautiful. More every time I look. And you have beautiful eyes. Do you speak... French... English? My French is funny, huh? Want something to drink? A Coke, please. How are you? It's OK. My French is bad. Talk English a little. It's late! We're going. You too? Take him back to camp. Ship? I don't like the military. You're welcome. It's free. What's the matter? I slept with the American. Going to tell Luc? I didn't know what I was doing. Afraid he'll be sore? And how! I'm sick of it. Look! There he is! Want me to leave? Certainly not. Going to say hi? I don't dare. Anyway, he's seen me. He can come to me. Maybe he's scared. He knows what he's doing. He's pretending not to see me. If I were you, I'd go. I won't. That'd fix things. It's disgusting! Makes me furious! Look at that idiot! Come on! When he kissed me, I lost track of what I was doing or where I was. I can't explain... It all happened very fast. When it was over, he said "Thanks a lot". Know what I answered? You can laugh, but it's not funny. I said, "You're welcome. It's free". Did he get it? I think so... I hope so. Are you sorry? No... but it's lousy. What if your father saw me here? He'd be embarrassed. Then he'd yell at my mother. She hates me, but says nothing. She keeps quiet about us, and I keep quiet about what she does. You mind her having a lover? What do I care? She's no spring chicken... You seen her rolls of fat? Cut it out... I should look like her at her age. She's not bad looking... It's weird... I can't think of my parents like that. - Why not? - I don't know... I can't imagine them having had lives of their own, before they met, and brothers and sisters. I know it sounds crazy... My dad won't go to Poland. He was too unhappy there. He's even forgotten the language. Where did your folks meet? They started being happy when they got to France. That's nice. It's sort of... Asleep? It's me. What classes did you cut? Math, physics, English... The worst! I'm sleepy. I read all night. Then get in. Don't start that! Your mother'll think it weird... She doesn't know we're classmates... I'm sleepy. Me too. I'm wiped out. It's so nice... Move over... Don't be a bedhog! You're a drag. You've got a huge bed, you know! That's no reason. I want a cigarette. Got any? Here's the old man! What are you two up to? No classes, Suzanne? No... We're resting. Hey, dad... I've got no classes. Martine thinks you're cute. She loves your eyes... Shall I join you in bed? - No room! - Quit goofing off, girls. I forgot to tell you... I went out with your brother. You're kidding? Couldn't matter less, but don't tell him... It matters to him, and he made me swear... You've got guts! It was only for 5 minutes... Well, 10 minutes... one afternoon... But don't tell him! Don't say you're busy: yesterday, I told you... you'd have to stand in for me until 2. As long as I can leave at 4... I'll be back by 2. I'm going to the Labor Office. That's astrakhan? Make sure it matches. They could undo them! I'll help you with the sleeves. I read the piece you gave me yesterday. Not bad! You mean it? This time you did it. You created... real characters in a few lines. Hats off! I couldn't do it. You're talented. But it was based on terrific characters. So pay me a royalty! See, one can't go it alone! It wasn't too depressing? The next step is... to keep it up and write a longer piece, with a real story. That's the test. I must learn to concentrate. I watched you write: you spend hours on one line. I couldn't. You'd be thinking about furs. No, not furs. Does Mom know you'll be at the Labor Office? What? She knows everything! It's good. I guess it's over. Where were you? At Solange's. I phoned: you weren't. Oh, yeah? I'll bet you did! Where's Robert? In his room. Hi! Hi, creepo. Call you tomorrow. OK, I'll call you tomorrow. Stay for dinner. No, I can't tonight. Next time. Love to have you. Know this Bonnard? Sensual, eh? Typical Bonnard. Are you staying? No, we have to go... Too bad. Dad... I'm being picked up. Solange and 2 boys'll ask you if I can go to the movies. What's all this! You know those boys? Now you go out at night? I don't go out. I invite friends over. Then we go to the movies. It's not a date. Cancel it at once! You think bad things happen only at night? All day I can do what I want... But come 8 p.m,, it's over. That's how it is! What an answer! It's too late. I can't reach them. She's doing nothing wrong. You can't throw those people out! I won't hear of it. Understand? I can't tell them to leave when they get here! You do it once more and I'll strangle you! You're nuts! Stop acting like I'm an idiot! - Every night! You're a real pain! - Not on her head! "Not on her head"! What is she? I won't put up with this in my own home! Tell your dad you're sorry... Sorry? What does that mean? For being rude... Rude? When was she rude? ‘Night, everyone. Where's Robert? Now I've banged my finger. Your home any different? Same thing. And you'd get hit? Come eat! Be a sport... Lend me 5 000 francs. Screw you, that's my pocket money. I'll give it back. We got a sucker for poker. Repaid the janitor? Tomorrow. In the morning I'll be at the dentist. 'Bye. Eat, you. Who? I cook, and no one eats. They starve for their figures! Make-up again! I said nothing! I haven't told them yet. Coming! It's my mother. The door! No towels! Let's go to my room. My dad's... Hi, unc! My dear Solange. Leading my daughter astray! We're going to the movies. To see what? I don't know yet. You haven't picked a movie? Not yet... You didn't think I'd ask? We'd better be off. Shall we go? Don't get her home too late. Midnight, latest. Notice her hair? "Notice her hair"? Who cares about her hair! Time flies! We waited an hour! Why didn't you come up? Did your dad yell? He was a drag as usual. You look real happy! Don't start with that! If you don't like it... I know, I can leave, I may just do that. This way... No, to your place. No, to the movies... Don't be a bastard! Why a bastard? All my friends say I'm nuts to see you. I mean it. They're jealous. They're not. They say I should drop you. I don't really turn you on? Sure you do, and you know it. Let's go to your place. Soon you'll be drafted. I won't see you at all. As if you cared! I'll be jealous. - Will you write me? - I don't know. You've got some nerve. After taking you home, I go see a hooker and think of you. Do you mind? Wasn't that great! I'm dead... You're beat? You make me laugh... You're really beat? No reaction... When I think about it... Want some? You come home now? I said midnight. It's 1 a.m. Big deal! Who's that boy? Which one? Don't put me on. What's his name? Bernard what? Bernard Trévisse. - What does he do? - He's been drafted. And before that? He works for his uncle, and lives with his grandmother. You going to marry him? Me, married? Then why do you see him? I just go out with him. That doesn't mean... I have to marry him. You look beat. Not going to bed? And you? Tomorrow you'll have to reckon with your mom. I'll be off, I'm beat. Good night. What's wrong with your eye? It's all yellow. Really, it's all yellow. You're nuts, my eye is perfectly white. You've changed recently. I've noticed it. In what way? I don't know... You don't smile as much. - What's wrong? - Nothing. You used to smile much more a while back... And I mean a few months ago... You seem bored. I'm not. You're imagining things. And you're so stubborn, you'll never say why. It's nothing... You changed about a month ago. Why didn't you tell me sooner? We don't talk much. OK, but that's no reason... You're changing... You look sad. I'm not sad. I'm tired. It's overwork. I think I'm going to move out. You are? To live where? That's my business. Thought of what it'll do to us? Yes, I have. Your brother'll be head of the family. A brother's not enough. Comes a day when you can't take any more. It may have come for me. You're fed up here? Comes a day... I've had it, yeah... You've got another woman, that's why. That's why people leave. Do you mind? And how! What do you care? You're my father, after all. So what? So I'm your father... I can't imagine you with another woman. I never said a thing. I can't imagine you gone, either. Tonight I imagined you with Bernard Trévisse. You think parents have no imagination? You're not fed up with Bernard? No, or I wouldn't go with him. Because you go with him? I mean, I wouldn't have gone to the movies with him. Isn't it odd that parents and kids never discuss that? Discuss what? That... You've only got one now. When did you lose the other? - I don't know. - You used to have 2 dimples... Where's the other? I don't know. Maybe it got fed up and left. I live with you every day, and I didn't notice! Anyway, you'll do fine with one! You'll manage... Now go to bed. For once, we got to talk! Out for a breath of air? Coffee? - Expecting anyone? - Not really. Too bad. I have to work today. What are you reading? Boris Vian: "The Heartbreaker". Any good? Sure. Why else would I read it? What's it about? I'm too lazy to tell you. You'd rather read. I'm in no rush. Cutting classes? Just out for a walk. Can I join you till my friend gets here? I watched you: you looked bored alone. I'm not bored. I'm down. Don't be down... Is it love? You've got a great smile. You've heard that before. Since I was three! Not very original of me. But it's true. Dad's moved out. Get up! You'll be late. Don't, it's too bright! You left the light on all night! You don't pay the bill! Wear a nightie. It's disgusting to sleep like that. Why disgusting? It's not done. Hurry. You'll be late! Hi, Richard. What are you doing? Math. I have a test. I had a weird dream. I was walking in the subway... Someone grabbed my arm. I turned around: it was Luc. He said: "Now you've been screwed, bitch, I'll screw you too." He was pulling me hard towards him... Then I woke up. Sheer remorse! It's strange. I hadn't dreamt of him in ages. You working? Café-owner has the hots for you! Come off it! That fat slob! As for Richard... He's undecided: he's hot for both of us. Look who's here... Can I talk to you a minute? That's amazing! Speak of the devil... I want to see this. She's unbelievable! Is she in heat! Now she's after Luc! Surprised to see me? Can't get over it. Did you try to see me again? I phoned often... But didn't dare speak. Let me kiss you. Stop it! I love you. Got nothing else to say? You just want to make love with me... because you know I've done it with others. I'll never do it with you. Never! Because you're a bastard of a guy. - Is that your last word? - Yes, it is. What did I do to you? What? You disgust me! I'm going. Luc, snap out of it! I wish I weren't like that... I'm too aware of things. How about just now? That was different. Why different? We were doing it... You forget yourself, don't you? You're hairy. Don't you like hair? Sure. Or I wouldn't be with you. Life's no fun when you don't love anyone. It's not that I don't love anyone... I adore my father. That won't get me far! It kind of scares me... It's as if my heart had run dry. Never been in love with a boy? Then why aren't you with him? It's my own fault. I didn't know what I was doing. Think of him a lot? Sometimes... I don't want to talk about it. I know what you need. A strong guy... who'd take you in hand. Maybe... I'm sure. Who knows... It'll happen. You're still young. I don't know... Maybe it'll never happen again. And another thing: when I meet a guy, I think of my father. I ask myself lots of questions: whether my father'd like him, think he was a decent person. Deep down you're a nice girl! I guess so. What are you doing? Go to bed! You're crazy to work this late. I'm going to my room. Where'd she put it? She's a real pain! Where's the dress Martine gave me? Where is it? In the garbage! That's where filth belongs! What right do you have? I'd love to belt you one! I won't let my daughter wear hooker outfits! Don't start again, you two! Who asked you? She had no business! This is my home! She's always poking in my things. Where are my letters from Bernard? My pictures? What letters? Don't pretend! You want to make me mad? Where are my letters? I want them! I tore them up long ago. You tore them? I'll belt you! Give me those letters! Leave your mother alone! - I want them! - You want to kill me? You'll succeed, bitch! I'm sick of life! You hear me? I'd rather be dead... For this I had kids? You two never stop fighting! Look at you! You crazy? Yes, I'm going crazy! I'll wind up dead! You hear? Go to your room. Calm down. - Is it over? - It's getting worse. It's got to stop! I've had it! Bunch of crazies! Go away, leave me alone! I'll kill you! Lie down. I'll make you some herb tea. I'm not crazy... But that's enough. Calm down... Want a cigarette? It's a real soap-opera! You say I'm sick: look who's talking! I don't hit people. Have you found dad? Have you tidied your room? It's fine as it is. Robert isn't in? He called. He's rehearsing late. I see. He's got it made. He only comes home to sleep. Leaves us alone, like dogs. I know. Then I'm splitting too. I can't take it. Where are you going? I don't know. Away from here. - You'll upset me again. - Leave me alone! - Where are you going? - I don't know... I'll see. Not hungry? It's fattening, and I get cross-eyed! Want some cheese? Want a plate, Suzanne? We're leaving. More for the others! You'll be hungry later. Got any beer? I'll hit you with a roll! Better watch out! Let's sing a song for... Angelo. I'm beat... And drunk. Where are we going? What are you up to? Did I wake you? It's not late. Come over... I don't have sex on the brain! Are you asleep? What's up? I've come to bug you. Let me sleep... You mind? I'm kind of beat... Martine doesn't like sleepyheads. I didn't sleep last night. How come? Guess... With the racket next door. Now we're even. You have Suzanne, I'll get the other guy. Talk about true love! You're lucky... Mine's a drag... How so? What's different about me? Maybe you're the drag! Leaving? - You settle it. - Settle what? I'm going back to my man. Some guys have all the luck. - Want me to take you home? - I'm not going home. How many days has it been? Dunno. It is my business, too. Don't panic! You think of him a lot. It happens. It's over now. I did a lot of dumb things with him... I didn't realize. What was his name? Good-looking? I'll say. And that's not my style... He was handsome. You scared me. Filth! I'll make you pay for it. Here we go, it's showtime! What about your little show! Look what you do to your mother! We've had it with you. Apologize! She wants to kill me! We're sick of you being unhappy! Apologize to her! On your knees! It's your fault! I hate your guts! I'll kill myself. But first I'll kill you! My daughter's a monster! So I'm a monster. You shouldn't have had me! You'll eat those words! Shut up! You're worse than her! I did so much... You'll eat those words! I paid for your analyst. A fortune! Screw my analyst! I don't need help. I even repainted the apartment, so you'd stay with me. Why don't you love me? She doesn't love me. Go to your room! From now on you'll deal with me! You shouldn't have made me. Who needs kids! I gave in to all her whims... So she'd like it here with me... I'm going. Be back around 6 p.m. Where are you going? I'm meeting your aunt... to clean the grave. Have fun! Lot of good it does granpal! You needn't come. You bet I won't. Except on the day you're buried. You ought to get your hair done. To please who? Your children... Yourself. Go straighten your room. I want to talk to you. I've decided: I'll go away to school. I can't live this way. We hurt each other. I can't stand her. Better if I go... don't you think? Can you take boarding school? It's strict. I'll come on weekends... They go by fast. Seeing her on weekends, maybe we can stand each other. It'll be calmer for you, too. Think it over carefully. I have. My mind's made up. It's the only thing to do. High school's screwed anyway... I stopped going. I cut my classes. Sometimes... I feel like killing myself... At times... I'm sick of living! What do you mean? I'm going. I forgot to tell you: You don't understand me. You never even tried to. Can't you see I'm unhappy? I'm only happy when I'm with a guy. Don't ask me to understand that. It's impossible! I know. That's all I wanted to say. You here? I thought you were away at school. I come home weekends. Paris is more fun. What's that pain in the ass doing here? Don't be mean, Luc. She bugs me! She doesn't have to follow me around! Be seeing you. Charge this to me. My gift! Great! Like it? Don't look so grim! Kiss Mel! Sore at me? No, why should I be? He was free. You really love him? Yeah. It's the first time. Still awake? So you got reamed, bitch! Stupid ass! Mom! Who reamed you this time, bitch? Wasn't your ass. You jealous? You'll regret it. Asshole! You're just a faggot. Shit! It's your goddam mother... Let her be! Go to your room! Get out, bitch! Thinks she's so hot! Go to your room! I don't want to see you. You're so dirty! You asshole! What's the matter? What's wrong? I don't want you to leave me. Is it because I had another date? Don't leave me. You know I won't leave you. I don't want you to cry... Not with me... It's bad for you. Want to walk a while? Come on. Want to go home now? You wanted to talk to me? You're the one to do the explaining. Suzanne said you beat her. We usually receive her friends in the hall. It's not funny. She's all bruised. Either you don't give a damn about your sister, so you let her alone, or you do care for her, in which case, the first thing to do was to meet me. Frankly, if I'd met all the guys... she dated, I'd have been a busy man. Didn't she say we were serious? You're not the first. I didn't want to hurt you, but my sister's fickle. She has a heart like a wheel... For the moment, it's you. You're cute, but then it'll be somebody else. I'm sure that's not true. She must have told you. I'd like to see her settle down, and let us be, so I can work on my career. I don't think you understand. I'm in a difficult position. There's my mother. For her, all that counts is marriage, that the bride be a virgin. So what do you suggest? I love my sister, but I have to protect my mother. We'll look for one there. Going to try them all? We'll find some place. I'm fed up. You could rent a cheap room. We spend hours doing this. What a drag! Bad-tempered, too. Cut it out! All this drives me nuts! Let's try this. I'll wait here. I've had it. Trying them all? Coming? I'll wait here. I've had it. Coming? Is it OK? Don't look so grim. It's nicer with the collar. It's for you. Luc! How did you know I was here? It'll be tricky. OK, at the café, in an hour. - Who was it? - A friend. It's my bridal wreath. I hope it brings you luck. Looks angelic, not like her real self at all. Be a dear, make coffee. You know where it is. Stop with the coffee! That's enough! You were sweet when you were little. When you were out alone, your father was afraid you'd be kidnapped... He adored you. I don't understand why he left... I do... and I don't. He loves us anyway. It hurts me when your brother beats you. Stop it! He thinks it's for your good, that he's replacing your father. When your father was stern with you, it used to make me sick. But maybe you were his favorite. Let me talk. You and your brother may not love me, but your dad did. He still does... I'm his youth. Quit chewing over all that. Think of yourself. Too late now. I've always worried about others. You cut your hair? I love you, Suzanne. I never stopped loving you. You know about Anne? Who cares? It was just a rebound. She couldn't stand breaking up with you. She went off to England with a guy. I'm getting married in a week. You don't love me? I almost called it off a month ago. Listen, I love you. I don't know what I can do. We can start over. It's not too late. Impossible! I don't want to hurt him. I don't want to always hurt people. He can't love you as I do... More now than ever. Anyway, I've changed. I'm not the same. I couldn't make you happy. I could make you happy. I don't know if I can still be happy. The only time I was happy was in the Alps, remember? I thought I was dreaming... That's why I wanted to die with you on the toboggan. I knew that after... Maybe I won't be truly happy with him, but it's the first peace I've known since we broke up. That's important. It's not enough! I'll make you 15 again. I'm not 15 any more. Dreaming again! I've never seen anything like it. There you are, joking with everyone, then pow! You're gone. My head aches. That's no excuse. It's the champagne. No it's not... It's my eyesight. It's poor. Then get some glasses. You've met Jean-Pierre? How long you been married? 6 months. Know of a job for him? It worries me. You bug me! He doesn't need me. A very modest neckline! So you used to beat your sister. I never beat my sister. I wanted to bite her because her skin was so nice, she smelled so good. She smells good! Are you jealous about your sister? Robert is. There's still something archaic... between brothers and sisters. I'm not interrupting... I hear you now say Robert's an asshole. Michel's changed. He envies my success. It's just a beginning... I'll show them all. Pretentious man! I'll say! Fanny, what are you doing there? Come here! My wife! You took my talent, don't take my wife. - She loves vulgar men. - I love only one man. You're lucky... She's beautiful. Ignoring me? It's divine! 20 years of work! My wife's beautiful. So's your mother... Scratching your head is very sensual. Your feet, too. I trained my sister well. She has an aura of lost virginity. She smells good! My leftist intellectual brother-in-law... Smell my sister! Very pleasant smell. How was Munich? Too heavy and slow, too rich, too fat, too provincial. Did you see the Picasso show? I raced through... like the Louvre visit in that Godard movie. I thought it wasn't bad, the early stuff wasn't bad. You don't like Picasso? Not much... He's overrated. And the myth... of Picasso, the great boy draughtsman... He was no Ingres! They weren't the same age. What do you mean? Picasso, in Barcelona, was only 9 or 10. And I disliked his backing Apollinaire... against the Douanier Rousseau. Of the two, Rousseau was clearly the better painter. That's not the way it happened. Were you there? I've read about it. They're off! So you read about it! Surprise you? No. Anyway, the myth of the old man, still young at 90, dying at the right time, with his daubs piling up at Vallauris... His daubs? Were you at Vallauris? Yes. I bought a jug for my mother. Horrible! By Picasshole! This guy's too much! You like Picasso? I do. I've seen all the Picasso shows. Her favorite painter is... Bonnard! It's sensual. I like things that last only a moment. That's why I like sensuality. I like what's momentary, so things like paintings, works of art... I don't like the past... It's boring. I like things of the moment, now, at the moment. He says "moment”like "mommy". Where is mommy? - What do you do? - Colorist. - What's a colorist? - He colors. Really, what's your line? I correct reproductions of paintings. Reproductions... Not even originals. You have to be good with your hands. It's artistic, not manual. He's a manual laborer! Like a brandy? More to drink? My daughter's beautiful! I don't want him touching her. Quit pawing her... He has dirty hands. Don't touch my sister. Don't, it bothers me. Cut it out! He's very... close to his sister. It's rather sweet. It's different from us. A difference in upbringing. I can't stand up... So you're out to make Michel. Poor Jean-Pierre. What about Jean-Pierre's buddy... Romain, with the big feet... Going to make him? What's the pitch now? Leave her alone! Just crap! You didn't change the locks... Good! Then I won't need a locksmith. May I come in? This is the dining room. Sorry, I didn't expect these distinguished guests. You have 60 feet here because this opens completely. Sorry, but the lease is expiring... We won't be long. Ignore us. The workshop... Your machines can go here. You have everything here... There's 48 feet. We didn't use the attic. There's plenty of space. You see, here... This is still your home, So respect it. Right, it's mine, the lease is up, so I'm showing the place. It's my home, so I'll have some cake... Some pudding. Can I eat in peace? I know you... in 2 seconds, you'll go... Well, you won't... I apologize. I didn't know I'd interrupt a party. I thought I'd find... the place empty. We don't mind. You're... the brother-in-law... My son's wife's brother. I get the feeling my son married you as well as your sister. Maybe. Ask him. It's all right with me. You're always on your high horse... You're hobnobbing... with such people? You who were going to be a furrier? You're giving me lessons, looking at me like that? I'm just an ignorant man but... sometimes... I didn't pry, but... he left magazines around, and I read your magazine. You write extremely well, by the way... but... you even did a special issue around his thing on La Scala. Later you let... them publish... something humiliating for you, dragging you through the mud, in seemingly objective interviews. One character rated you 3 out of 20, said you were pitiful. You content just to reply? You could've replied for him. It's not my business. If you came to make trouble, blow. I'm just telling the truth, and that's always... You're pompous. You used to be exciting. And you're money mad, or will be. Money isn't always dirty. But when you've always believed certain things, and you suddenly discover all this, a gulf opens. You wonder why you've lived. I once read... maybe it's not true, I wasn't there, but when Van Gogh died... Stop it! But about Van Gogh: when he died, he supposedly said, and if he didn't say it, he could have... He said: "There'll always be sadness." It struck me, because I thought... like everyone, in fact... that is was sad to be... like Van Gogh. But what he meant was that other people are sad. No? You're sad. Everything you do is sad. It's sad to have a wife whose brother insults you, or slanders you in his rag. You'd do anything to succeed, so take wing, fly... I thought you'd be the next Pagnol. How's he doing? You know as well as I do. He's talented and... He has a unique talent. He wrote things... Wrote dialogue where the characters came to life, I thought... my son was a new Pagnol. And you think we're destroying his talent? He's your brother-in-law. Money talks! Right, Miss Suzanne? You're like them? Am I right, or are they? Don't make her take sides. Why not? Where do you stand? Right here. She's on my side. When she visits me, I ask nothing of her. Whose side is she on then? You never told me you see him. You're here one day... I'm on no one's side, I'm for myself, but I'm here... Suzanne really loves you. She loves everyone. I don't agree. She'd love me dead. You always want the people you love to die. A girl doesn't think that of her father. They all wish I'd die: I'd become a living god! With me dead... Stop, goddamit! Go to the kitchen. It was fun until you barged in. Stop! Get out! This is normal for you, don't start on me. I've seen enough of you. Screw your lease! Defend your mother. Note, she hit me. I hear you practise on your sister. Look after her, it's high time you did. Like you: with daily beatings! You never phone to ask how we are. You swine, get the fuck out of here! I put up with that vulgarity for 20 years... 20 years... Drop dead! Don't make me mad! Get out! - Don't yell! - I just said get out! Sit down, and I'll leave. Here, sweetheart. Scram! Sit down. We can't keep up this routine forever. You sit down. And you beat it! Mom packs a punch! Life is weird: you admire your father, he moves out. See him again: he's someone else. Our being here upset him. We should've left. I think he's gone mad. You don't visit often. Where are you going with your little bag? I'm leaving. It still won't lock! Hope you're not going far... Hot day. So what's up? You're moving out, too? - For the weekend? - I'm going to San Diego. Really? For long? 3 or 6 months. I'm not sure yet. Tell me all. Couldn't you have told me sooner? Yeah, but I haven't seen you... When I was a kid, going to Trouville was a big deal. You only saw the sea once a year! Now you hop to the Pacific! Adrien told me that in winter, you see schools of whales off the coast. Must be great! They say San Diego's great, too! Biggest US naval base. Lots of sailors, and you love uniforms! - Who are you going with? - Michel. The guy with the big nose. Why did you get married? What's happened to Jean-Pierre? You'll never manage to love anyone. When you were tiny, you were so cute... I thought you'd get kidnapped. I needn't have feared for you. You think you're in love, but you just want to be loved. - Everyone's like that. - Certainly not. Some people can love. Not many. You're not among the select few. You should stay there. It'll do you good. I'll visit you now and then. I'm not washed up. So, will you forget us? I won't forget you... A honeymoon, with someone else. You should do the same. Give me a kiss. The first time you didn't push me away. No, the second. Remember? Stay over there. When your mom and I were young, we wanted to move to Canada. But we didn't. I might not have been born. Look at your bag... Carrying it? You can't register it in that shape. It stays with me. Goodbye. This is as far as I go. Hurry.
