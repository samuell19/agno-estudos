Produced by Taichang Entertainment. Inc It was a horrible rainy stormy day... The moment came at last... It was an historic moment of a big game. - Rainy? - It rained damn hard. Lightening and thunder, too! Lmagine a bunch of bloody street thugs staring at him. How fucking unfair, it was like one to one 30! But you know what? They were trembling! What a disgrace, in the beginning! I bet you're right. But this fearless legend just jumps off the ground like hell... - It was almost 20 meters. - 20 meters? Wait. You dickhead. How you brag! Is he a fucking bird orjet? Oh, trust me, my friend saw it with his own eyes. Don't tell me to believe you, jerk. Call this stupid friend of yours, let me talk to him. Let me see, 10 meters? You playing me or something, jerk? Okay, 5 meters. How annoying! So, go ahead with this damn story. This legendary bastard was just incredible! He just outdid every single bastard, undisputed. One superman and 30 minnows Not beaten a bit but attacked every single one to the hilt! Kill me! Sick bastards You little... He just finished off the whole pack of them and... At last the big show against the big gun was left. But the big gun was... no match for this legend. And this legend turned into a merciless dog to the beaten. He took out the cutter this long... I can't believe it. 7cm. He always leaves a mark on the defeated with the knife. Hellish devil. That's how he was nicknamed 'Seven Cutter', and he's transferred to our school! The Legend of Seven Cuter JUNG Han-soo... Boss, you should come up with something. He'll go after you. How about running away? I'm no chicken! Forget the sucker. Legendary Seven Cutter? Of all high schools, he's coming to ours, why? JUNG Han-soo? He's such an inhuman ruthless ass! He's steamed up. Nothing stops his horrifting weapons. - No kidding! - I'm serious. He's left a 30 cm mark on it! Oh, how I was hurt to see the cut. He had no fucking respect for me as a principal. Oh my God! So, you better stay out of his way. For him, the sky is the limit. Take care of yourself. Hello! Look what the bastard has left! Come on, Han-soo Hey, Miss KIM. You smell like heaven every morning. You've got such a sensitive nose. I'm afraid you'll turn into a dog, some day. He's coming. He's here! Come on, jerk. The devilish legend of Seven Cutter, Han-soo. It almost gives me goose bumps. Don't worry, my love, Mr. KOH will take care of him. Don't count on it. He's just a wacky PE teacher! How come you feel for the pervert? You better watch your mouth! I want to see Han-soo. Me, too. Hating him you want to see him? I can take precaution against him; that's why. I want to tell you this: I'm 1 year from retirement. I'm asking you, I want no trouble-making student until then. So you got tipped off already? I'd like you to understand where I am at. I'm sorry but I can't. - Hey, Ma'am. - Sir. - Hey, Ma'am! - Sir! The corrupted principal took a bribe and faked students' report cards! And Han-soo did what he had to do. The end can'tjustift the means but my boy couldn't sit back and watch! Oh my God! And as a boy, he could do it in the heat of the anger. Sorry, but it's beyond my endurance as an educator... to accept a cutter user as a student. What? - You used a cutter? - No, it as an awl. An awl? See, it's not a cutter, to begin with. And it was just a scratch. Few can notice, so don't make a fuss! He's reassigned to this school with no intention to go to another school. As I told you... For the record, tell the principal that he was damn lucky. If I'd been there, I'd have torn it to pieces! He deserved more than that! Oh my God! He cuts exactly 7 cm. A dog barks at him, he cuts the dog! His prey gurgles blood with flesh slashed and torn. Here comes a newcomer, be kind to him. - JUNG Han-soo? - Yes? - Say hello. - Yes, ma'am Hello, everybody, I am JUNG Han-soo. Being shy, I didn't make many friends at the previous school. But I want to befriend you all. I'm excited to have you all in my life. Take a seat there next to Jung-shik. Hey, welcome, Han-soo, I'm Sung-gi Thanks. - You got the schedule? - Schedule? Sure I got it. Wait, I got it here. Where did it go? Be quiet and let's begin the class. Bow! Hello, Miss KIM. Good morning everyone. Today, it's lesson 8. Lesson... Damn good! Wow, damn well-built body! It's really good anyway. It's the same guy. He is... Hey! You must be JUNG Han-soo? Yeah, and you're the class captain, right? - You saw it? - Saw what? You saw it. I happened to see you, I didn't tell you to take them off! Moreover, I knew you're a boy, until I saw your boobs. You son of a bitch. What's this about? What a pervert! Let's do it! Do what? Min-joo! Miss KIM wants to see you, hurry. She saves your ass. A nose bleed. What a girl! Look, blood. Again, like father, like son. What's it with me? You got no guts to fight against thugs and gave up your business! Why don't you try to pay her back, as a piece of memory? Don't tell me you know how horrible the kids of these days are! How about knives? Mom, why me now? You take it off. I'll go to the costume play show. I am a sailor moon. My role is so big there. Moon crystal power. I won't forgive you. Let me do this in the name of the justice. Wait there! You're retarded or what? I can't stand this. Screw Sailor Moon or Sun or whatever! Damn. I'd have done him on the spot! What? My boobs? I'll kill him. Or it could be a stupid move on my part. Min-joo, come over and help me with this. Han-soo, you're dead. Peel the garlics! Peel the garlic... kick his ass... whatever!! Are you sure? Min-joo hit Han-soo? No doubt out of a reliable informant. He's nothing then. Okay, let me crush thatjerk. What if you're crushed? Oh man, you know I'm better than that! Sure I do, itjust slipped out. Fuck off. Okay, chew up everything, and this gum. What cheap gum! You don't have good taste in choosing gum? He's here. Han-soo! Hey, is this your base camp or something? I'm Sung-gi. As the gang leader here, let me have it out with you! What? Why me against you? Seven Cutter, don't think I'm such a chicken. Seven Cutter? You forgot your nickname? Now it makes sense. What? I'm not the Han-soo you're thinking of. There's another Han-soo. I went to the same high school. I'm sick of that misunderstanding. You're not the gang leader, Seven Cutter? We've got the same name but we're different people. Don't try to fuck with me. Oh, you got no idea how horrible and merciless Han-soo is! Then there's nothing to worry about? You bet, man. So you're nobody, huh? Once boss, forever boss! Sung-gi. Sung-gi has been and will be our leader. Stop, guys. Hey, enough, moron. Now I see why you've got a stupid monkey face! SSorry. What's so funny, idiot? - You worthless shit! - Wait. You stupid son of a bitch! We're not panhandling! Honestly, this is all I got. Hey, show him! You just pushed my button. What are you doing? What? You told me to show him. What a jackass! I mean show him our process! Process? Here I go. It's not mine. I found it. Oh, you surprised me! You wanna play me or what? I told you, this is not mine! I'm telling you have it out with me. You're driving me nuts. It's not mine! Sung-gi! Seven cm! No, Sung-gi it's a mistake. What a mean fucker! I told you, it's not mine. You son of a bitch, Han-soo! I'm the gang leader, so you should treat me as one. You bastard. Come on out and get me. Sung-gi, please calm down. I'm not what you think I am. You cut me 7 cm! You play innocent and tell me to buy it! Wait. Wait for what? What? Okay, but take it easy... If you get worked up, you can't get the best out of yourself. So let's smoke and then do that. It's kinda like foreplay for me. - You mean a cigar? - Yes. - After a cigar, all right? - Sure. Give me a cigar. When I finish smoking you're done. Got a cigar? Then you said 'let's smoke', with no cigar? Light. Oh, Sung-gi, fire! It's too hot. You psychotic pervert! Sung-gi! Sung-gi, let me extinguish it! Son of a bitch. Let me rip your fucking guts out. Are you kidding? No. You know what's the worst part? He cut Sung-gi's belly apart and set fire on his body! How lewd! What? Cut and fire? Wily, sneaky bastard. Min-joo, he'll come after you, be ready for that. I'll never sit and watch, let him do it. Oh, my God. What's this fuss about? How miserable Min-joo is! Look, decalcomania! He's coming, Han-soo! Sung-gi? How's your leg? Han-soo, I'm fine, thanks. Oh, I was taking a nap, being so tired from drinking. Okay, go back to sleep. JUNG Han-soo! On the first day, you claimed kingship of the school! - What? - Stay calm! I'm not scolding you. How long have I waited for you! From now on, screw teacher or student! Let's have it out Man to man! Man to man. Have a match. Oh, Mr... Call me Min-shik. Mr. KOH, you got the wrong idea about me... I told you, call me Min-shik. Oh, Min-shik... Just say Min-shik let's have a match. How dare to my teacher? Come on, say it! Min-shik... - Let's start! - Let's start... Min-shik, here we go! Min-shik, here we go... Oh, Miss KIM... I don't know what's going on... All the students and even Mr. KOH treat me as a gang leader. Then you're not Han-soo we've been terrified about... - Miss KIM... - Uh? Please tell Mr. KOH about this. Don't worry, he's such a wacko. That's why he's called Moron KOH. - Moron KOH? - What a wacko! I heard he used to be a notorious bully and thug. He even picked a fight against the head of the students union at college... and he took the students union for an opposing gang. Then how could he enter college? He filled out the answer sheet in the wrong order. He was the favorite guy of the Goddess of Fortune. What? I'll take care of everything, and you don't worry about a thing. - Oh, Miss KIM. - Ah? Oh poor boy, my little bird. 15 years ago, when the whole city was under my control... We had an unspoken rule for any game... Win or lose, no complaints were accepted. It's not what you think, Mr. KOH. So you, you filthy scumbag, drive me back to my field. One, to get rid of scrupulous thugs like you. And two, to make my comeback as a real boss. Oh, you're making me crazy. Here it goes. What the hell are you doing now, bastard? Stand up, Get your ass up! You're right I'm a real scumbag. How dare I think of having it out with you, even for a moment? Just beat me up with this. What? As you wish... Oh, no, Mr. KOH no Min-shik, wait. It's not enough for my unthinkable wrongdoing. Take this and give me a lesson for besmirching you as a teacher. Are you insane? This will make your backbone break! And this has nails on it your flesh will be torn to shreds. It's okay, sir. What I need to get back to being a human again is Min-shik's beating. You completely lost it! Mr. KOH! Oh, Miss KIM... Miss KIM. What are you doing here? You beat that small boy with this hellish weapon? No, it never happened. He just gave it to me as a gift but... Don't, for one minute think I believe you! It's true. Han-soo, tell her the truth! I'm okay, sir. Just keep beating me without end. - Hey, what? - Miss KIM! Are you all right, Han-soo? How painful! I've been in real hell, but I can manage it. Hell? What hell? I didn't even touch you! - You disgusting fraud! - Believe me! Han-soo, can I help you up? Mr. KOH, I'm warning you. If you do this again, I'll report it to the school board. No, don't take it wrong! How funny, you telling me to buy that shit! - It's me that's in hell. - Shut up! Han-soo, let me help you to go to the ER, stand up. - Oh, my backbone. - Miss KIM! Do you think Mr. KOH will have a crush on me when he sees my hot body? Oh, come on, babe - What's with you? - Oh, hey! I'm sad for her. - What the...? - Here I go! What a psycho! Hello, you're dreaming of a spicy body? You join me and your dream will come true! Go to hell with your dream! What? Min-joo, you don't change? When you leave. It smells fishy. You're a boy, that's why! Right. - Move it! - 1, 2, 3! Oh, come on, my babe! Here I go! You're dreaming of a spicy body? What did I do? Damn! What the hell! Hi, Min-joo! What's that? JUNG Han-soo, you're dead! Me? Hey, Min-joo, you aren't going for lunch? I need to talk to you. Why me again? Just follow me. I love chicken but what's this for? It's just a favor as a friend. Then we can dig in? Sure, go ahead. Help yourself. Sung-gi, fill me in about Min-joo. She's the class captain and a nerd! That bitch is a boxer! - Clever, tough and arrogant! - What a loathing bitch! But why Min-joo? She challenged me! Moron KOH and Min-joo... So many rivals on your way! Sung-gi, tell her to claim the top or whatever! Tell her, I don't care! You mean you can buy my pride with this fucking chicken? You even set me on fire to get rid of me along the way. And you're giving up to her, hands down? I see. I won't. You're all right? Want to eat this? Have it. Idiots, what did you do to the chicken? You should have used less sauce! I knew this was coming. You did? How come? She's driving me crazy. You stop there! She runs like hell! What should I do? Poor me! You're dead. No way out! Just come out and get me. Min-joo I can't do this... I can't hide how I feel for you any more! Min-joo! You are insane or what? Hands off! - I'm very much sane! - Let me go, bastard. Min-joo! Fuck off! The more you ignore me, the more I feel for you. What? The first moment I saw you, it was like being reborn. I haven't been able to run away since. I've never been... this much in love so fast. I can't believe myself, but this is how I feel. Bullshit! Have you ever given a thought to... why I don't want a fight with you? What are you saying? You can't imagine how painful it is to hear from the one I love... Bullshit, What? Fuck off. Please no more bullshit! Min-joo! Just try to feel how I feel. Min-joo... Iron a handkerchief of the girl you feel for? How shameful? Give him up, and I'm here for you, mom. You're another disappointment, and what's this for? Again, for a costume play. I'm Frog Prince. You frog or whatever screw yourself. I don't give a shit! What are you doing? Momnothing! So is this sand bag your husband, or what? Look, I broke the record and got tickets! - What record? - Computer game! Hey, bro, why don't you go to the loony bin? You're the last person to say that. To say what? I'm angry! Damn! What? I'm... looking for Mr. KOH. He's not here. No problem, I'll come later. What are you doing here? Me? I came here to see you... and... You did? I'm here for Mr. KOH. Miss KIM sent for him. He's not in there. Really? You're here for me, why? Well... - What're those? - These are... They're movie tickets. I want to go to movies with you. - Movies? - You don't like it? No, I really do. I'm a screwball. Hit me. I'm a loser. You mean this petty cash works it out? What a stingy nerd! Okay, then I will send you to a very special place. And you need to take a road to hell to get there. Hold him tight. Come here. Come here, moron. What the? - What are you doing? - Han-soo, why are? I wanted to tell you this anyway. Here. Sorry it's too late. What's this for? Bully money collecting book. And this outcast is under the special control. This is all yours and we're happy with small shares. Damn, how long should we do this shit? I'm starving. Shut the fuck up. Screw Han-soo! This is too much! We did ourjob and he did what? Watch your mouth! Our voice is being recorded! Hi, Han-soo? Join me, you jerks! Han-soo is our leader, now and forever! I love this pork cutlet! You like your lunch, Jung-shik? I don't know how many hardships you've gone through... but think of it as you casting out the jerks not being outcast by them. Here. What a stroke of genius! But, Jung-shik, I don't want you to cast me out. That's Han-soo, right? When he's pissed off, he turns into a beast. Sung-gi, the dickhead, was beaten to a pulp! Reallythe dickhead almost died! Are you kidding? He's impotent, then? Cut the crap. Sung-gi deserves that. Jung-shik, the victim, even went to therapy, Han-soo did the right thing. Min-joo, you look so weird to be so supportive to Han-soo! - I smell something fishy. - You're right. - Hey, grab your lunch! - I've got it. - Hey - Hi, Min-joo. You're waiting for me? You should come home earlier than this. Yeah, I know. What are you doing here? - Where are you going? - Let's go! Wait, let me ask mom first. When you told me... you've been feeling for me It's not bad. Th... thanks... It was something I can't imagine coming. So I gave another thought to what men mean to me... and what you mean to me. Well, you're noted as a ruthless seven cutter but... If I take good care of you, you'll turn into a stud. Take care of me? Han-soo, we're made for each other. It feels different than when I hold a fighter on the ring! Don't say no when I tell you to be in my arms like this! They're too big for me, and unrefundable so... They're yours. No, thanks, I don't need them. Try them on. I see. You got any idea what your son, the thug, did to my son? - I'm so sorry. - 'Sorry' is all you can say? Look what the jerk did to these poor boys! I apologize. Hey, Han-soo is everything alright? Where did you hide him? We're all so curious about it. You better keep him safe. When we find him, he's dead. I've got very sad news for you. The trip scheduled for tomorrow... is cancelled because of the rain. It's what some teachers insist, but... I talked them into not canceling it. Did I do good? 1, 2, 3! 1, 2... How sweet the sea wind is, eh, Miss KIM? Sea wind? It smells so bad. And you smell worse! Stinky! Whenever I see the sea... The one thing on my mind is that... A man's mind should be deep like the sea. And we should love women like that. How touching! But I find the way of loving in the mountains. I like mountains better! Miss KIM, you aren't tempted to dive now? Are you insane? You, the worst diver, dive here? Damn. Are you sure you can do this? I saw this on TV. They caught tuna. Miss KIM, I'm asking you to save my pride. You got pissed off at my diving comment? Okay go ahead, if you have guts and swimming skills. It's more than that. My pride has been hurt. And pride as a 'once' gang leader and a man all gone. And if you're with me I can be what I should be. Oh, no more bullshit! Give it to me. For the last time I'm begging you. I would like you to be with me. I got it! What's going on? What a weirdo! You're a repulsive freak! What the hell are you doing? Let me take off my pants. What a wacko! Please help me out with this. Help you with what? A blow job? Pervert, freak, son of a bitch moron, shithead! Fucker! It's not what you think. Miss KIM! Grab it! The bastard is transferred here? - Right, boss. - Fucker! He hides his ass here? He didn't know we'll go after him even to hell. He didn't know we'll go after him even to hell. Don't repeat me, you idiot. You, cut the crap and get some of his men, got it? You just hit a new level of stupidity! You are such a bunch of lame-brained trash! You produce pornography? Your brain is full of shit! Do it right, jerks. You're so repulsive and humiliating. You stink! Oh, guys, get up and freshen up. Forget the costume play! Hurry. What's this about? Such curiosity could kill your brain cells for schoolwork. So just like me, you do the right thing! Hurry! Miss KIM? Yes? Too beautiful a night to go to bed. What about hanging out with me? Hanging out? Hang it up! - Listen to me! - Mr. KOH! Shall I give you some tips? Forget it, screwball! When it comes to women, you can count on me. You know what spellbinds women? It's a shocking performance! - Performance? - Cool and formidable one! Performance! Oh, I don't think it'll work for her. You wanna die? Oh, Mr. KOH! What the hell are you doing? Miss KIM! This is a special performance for you! It's too hot. Water spring. Hi. Yoon-ah. Thanks. Gorilla! Mobile phone! It's Yoon-ah's Restroom Okay, let me take a photo of myself! Cute one. I'm doomed! What should I do? What great tasting water! Hey, what are you doing? - Mr. KOH... - Water is really good. - See you! - Why don't you try this? Non-polluted, pure and natural! He just did it! - Hey. - Uh? - It's all right? - Okay, okay. Water ink, easily removable. - Water ink? - Yeah. Look! They kept this delicacy to themselves? - What the! - Are you Han-soo? - Right, Han-soo. - You scared me! What's so funny? What? Damn, oil paint! Miss KIM... I've been... watching you for a long time. So, I want to know what you think about me. I've never thought about you. Ever. I see. - Miss KIM? - What? Then how about beginning to think about me? And if you listen to this, you'll think about it. This letter tells it all. Let me read this. This is what I feel for you. How long I've wished this moment to come... With the beautiful sea and... you and me... Now I will set a boat of solitude afloat on the sea and... Hey, are you all right? Take it easy and stay calm. Throw up! Try to vomit it! You can't? Open your mouth. Open your mouth! So, what do you think of me? - Do I look fine? - Yeah. - Thanks. - No sweat. - I'm such a jerk. - You know that? For you, I could be way worse than a jerk. Oh, you've grown up! Have I? - Guess what? - What? You look so cool when you don't speak. Oh, really? Min-joo, can I... have that fish? Don't give me any rubbish. Hey. Here. You wanna carry it all along? This? It's not on your page. Give it to me. Don't even think of having or using it. I wanted to throw it away, anyway. It's not mine. Whose is it then? - The worst bastard's. - It's yours then! No, it's not mine, I won't tell then. - Don't be sullen. - I don't like to talk. 1, 2, say it! Okay, I'll tell you. ER Years ago, my best friend was carried to the ER. He'd been suffering as a outcast... But I didn't know that. He tried to kill himself. The bully tortured him every single day... With that cutter. Oh, I see. So I had it out with the bully. He was such a cruel killer, but it didn't frighten me. I slowly walked to the bully and all the scumbags. JUNG Han-soo! Kill him! It was a totally unfair match, to begin with. I was alone and they were 30 thugs with weapons. But I attacked them from all directions. One by one, they fell down, being silenced. For me, it was like a picnic. Then the big gun took out a cutter. Don't worry; it didn't scare me at all. Looking for a critical moment to take him out... I punched him on the chin. He tumbled 10 meters and threw a towel. He and his men were all taken to the ER, it was my game! So how many were carried to the ER? - Of course, all 30 of them. - All of them? You're laughing? You don't believe me? Hey, I believe you. And your friend? He emigrated to Australia. He wasn't an outcast after all. You were with him, right? Min-joo... you're so... pretty. You didn't know that when you told me you feel for me? I mean... you look prettier today. You've got good taste in girls. I know I'm a pretty girl. And have this with you all the time; thinking it's me. - Take this! - You again? - Stop there. - No! - I'll get you then you'll regret it. - Catch me! Stuffed bear? I'll give it to Yoon-ah. Just like this! Min-joo, join us and dance like this! Hey, Jung-shik, let's dance and have fun. I love you, Mr. KOH. It's done! Why? Where did you get that? Somebody left it for me as a gift. - It's yours? Take it back. - No, I won't. - I need to ask you. - What? What did you do with the bear? When I woke up in the morning, it was just gone. Sorry... You fooling around with me? Let me explain to you... What are they doing? Sorry. You're a jerk! Min-joo, I've done this! Mr. KOH will take this as a token of my love. Look at this! What, why, Min-joo? Min-joo! Sorry, but... Can I take that back? What's this fuss over a damn bear? Here, I don't give a fuck. Watch your mouth. Han-soo, want to play a coin game? - You didn't see Min-joo? - No... Forget the girl and play the game. Han-soo! Jung-shik, did you see Min-joo? I didn't see her. What happened? - No, never mind. - Han-soo! - What? - Wait. There goes Han-soo! - Let's talk about it later. - But... Get this bait. It's Han-soo! Han-soo! Haven't you found her? The bus is leaving soon, and we've seen nothing of her! And the bitch is making trouble. I mean... Change the mode to mute, I told you! It's called 'mute etiquette' you know that? Oh, it's Han-soo's? I'm happy it works damn good! JUNG Han-soo Han-soo, I'm sorry. I gave your number to him. I'm really sorry. Hey, you like it? Move your ass, or your buddy will be crippled. Don't take it wrong, that outcast is not my buddy. What a disgrace to befriend such a moron. What the fuck! We had to work on this moron so hard to get your number. I believed you two were buddy-buddy. Let me make this clear. I was nice to him, as the dumbo was so miserable. I never added him to my buddy list, fuck! He's such a freaky dumb loser! Take him, for free. What a loser, to say he's my friend! Loser and lunatic, you two are made for each other. What? - I gotta go. - Hey, JUNG Han-soo! Son of a bitch! We need find Jung-shik first. I care about him. You pretended not to, to save him then? Let's divide into two! - I see, do you copy? - Of course. It's Han-soo, right? You know what we need? Reasoning and thinking. If we do this, Mr. KOH will be disappointed. Anyway we get on the bus and go home... Then you can worry or woo or woewhatever. I don't want to disappoint Mr. KOH a bit. Please don't do this! What a stroke of luck, more bait is on the way. Let's hurry, the bus and the whole class is waiting for us. Hey, damn good to see you. What? Bitch, you got to respect me! Oh, 911, 911... Han-soo! I have to quit smoking. I can't run any more. Han-soo! Why the hell don't they answer the phone? Taxi! Hello, you two get here, fast! Where are you now? Just go to the north, from the point where we split. No, not to the left! To the right, to the direction of the hand you eat with! What? You're left-handed? Go fuck yourself! Hurry! You're late and you're dead. You don't get it? You shithead! Han-soo, let me go with you! Han-soo Your lover boy is not what he used to be! Bastard. Han-soo! - Jung-shik. - Who the fuck are you? You mean bastard. Son of a bitch. Screwball! That tough girl is your bitch, huh? No, she's not my bitch. She's the one I love. How impressive! Like a stupid boy, like an ugly girl. We belong to each other, as you belong to the trash! Don't go so easily. We need one more round. You bet! See how upgraded I've become? Son of a bitch. What a fighter! I'm sorry, Min-joo, are you all right? You're bleeding. - I'm in the battlefield... - Let me help you up. Han-soo, you're the real boss! You're the best. - Don't lose it any more. - I won't. Jung-shik! - Jung-shik, are you okay? - Are you alright? Min-joo, here. Jung-shik, let us help you up. What a good buddy you are. How dare I consider myself your buddy...? I'm such a loser! Thanks for pretending so far. Pretending what? You don't have any idea, you stupid monkey! Show respect to the boss, loser! You wanna die? Hey, Han-soo said that to save you from those bastards. Trust me, I was next to him, when you were on the line. Hey, Jung-shik. Let's be friends. I'm sorry. I've been a heartless, cruel animal to you. I'm extremely sorry. This guy is so light. Jung-shik, let's go. Han-soo, when he gets here, this newcomer will go after you! He's that tough? I told you, he's a legend of the south! He crushed 30 street thugs on his own. What started the fight? The thugs splattered some sauce from the next table. Some sauce? Why did the thugs splatter sauce or water or whatever? Maybe they were drunk like dogs. My dad is like that every night! - I don't like his joke. - You shut your mouth! Of all the schools, why ours? Han-soo, did the jerk come already? Southern legend? You stay out of this shit. I'll kick his ass out of here. You just stay out of this. He's here. Who is JUNG Han-soo? That's me. We'll start an opening game. Make his way. Good. Be ready, cutie! Wait, I'm here for you! I resigned. Help me out! Don't follow me. Again? Han-soo is really something! If you don't like it find a new boyfriend! I hate to do the same shit all over again!
