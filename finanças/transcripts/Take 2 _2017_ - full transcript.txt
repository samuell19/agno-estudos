I've lost count of the times I've been caned. I've been in and out of prison my entire life, just to prove that I am a hero and I'm above the law. First stroke! I'm Tiger, a man from the triads. I fear nothing, not even the gods. But before the cane, from hero, I become zero. Like me, Mad Dog is a repeat offender. The time he spends in jail exceeds his time outside. Second stroke! He joined the triads when policemen still wore shorts. The Penal Code of Singapore has thousands of criminal offenses. Violating another man might be the only crime he has yet to commit. This is Black Panther. His boss used his loyalty against him. They scapegoated him for their crimes of robbery and scams. Third stroke! That's how he got in. Since then, he changed his name to Silly Panther to remind himself not to be stupid again. He was a teacher. The night before his wedding, his friends made him drunk and got him a prostitute for his bachelor's night. It turns out that the prostitute would only turn 18 after midnight. When the police came, it was 10:30 p.m. Still in a drunken state, he assaulted the policeman's little brother. Third stroke! His name is Jian Ren. Upon conviction, his fianc√©e broke off their engagement... I am innocent. ...because she felt that her Jian Ren had really become a lewd man. After this last caning, we suddenly came to our senses. We decided that once we are released, we will never come back again. Brother Blackie, did you remember wrongly? Is it really today? Just shut your trap. Tiger! Tiger! Tiger. It's good that you're out now. You must have been well inside. You've grown a bit fatter. He is the one I've always mentioned to all of you. My life savior, Brother Tiger. During the gang fight we had, if he hadn't saved my leg by injuring MRT's, I wouldn't be staying on the 50th floor now. I can only stay on the 8th floor. Why? I can't reach the lift button. Brother Blackie, who is this MRT? He is new to all you newcomers. The scars on his back are as complicated as the tracks of the MRT. And his mind is like the MRT too. It'll just break down without warning. Come. Tiger. Here's some money. Go get yourself nice clothes and good food. Brother Blackie. I don't want to be in your care anymore. Do you want to quit following me? Then what do you want to do? Sell newspapers? Sell snacks at the night market? It doesn't matter what I have to sell. On account of what I had done for you, please let me go. Listen to me. Ah Yu, let's go. Tiger. Tiger! His head is spoiled from staying in prison. I'm warning you guys. Don't go to jail if you have nothing better to do. Do you understand? Dad. Chua. Ah Yu, please let Chua know how apologetic I am. I'll move out once I find a job. He's in a bad temper now. He must have gotten a fine today. Ignore him. Uncle, I heard that you eat black bean rice in prison. Is that true? Don, come in! Have you finished your homework? Go. How is Guang these days? Do talk to him when you have the chance to. His school called recently. He seems to be mixing with some bad company. It's all my fault. I've never taken care of him since he's young. When I have the time, I'll speak to him. Here. It's for you. A handphone? I don't need it. Do you expect people to hire you on the spot? They'll need time to consider after the interviews. Shouldn't you give them a contact number? How do I use it? Guang. Guang, are you free? Teach me how to use this. I've never used this kind before. The old one I had was as hard as steel. I could use it to crack open crabs. It was called "Nor-key-ah." Tiger. Tiger. You're out. Are you here to find me? Panther. It looks like you're doing well. Get in first. Hurry. Welcome. Hey, why did you stop here? I'm waiting for my driver. Do you have a driver? Are you shocked? Friend, let me tell you. We've been inside for so long. The world has undergone tremendous changes. It is filled with all kinds of things now. It was a shock for me, it will be for you too. Do you know what this is called? What? Out. Of. The. Box. Out. Of. The. Box. What is that? Teach me. I've never dreamt of that. Back in prison, I have to listen to you. Now that we're outside, you have to listen to me. Yes! Things come full circle... Hi! - Who's that? - My driver. Driver? In your dreams! Such a beautiful scene right? It's even in slow motion. These are all your parking fines. You took my car for a month and parked it illegally, dashed through red lights, and urinated in a tunnel. I checked for CCTV before I did my business. You missed one then. The police saw it clear as day. They even laughed at you. This guy told me he just came back from overseas. And is not used to working in Singapore. I took pity on him and agreed to share my car with him. I would rather share the car with him instead. Did you just come back? Did you go overseas after your release? Release? Released from where? Changi Prison? Listen to me... What crime did you commit? Molest, rape, or sex with a minor? I'm not that great. I was... First? Rape first, then murder or murder, then rape? I was framed. I am the one framed by you. Give me back the keys. Those total up to 2,000 dollars. Hurry up and transfer it to me. I don't want to see you rapist again. - Rapist? - Let me tell you, I'm very popular. I am the last virgin in this district. Listen to my explanation. Protect me. Hurry up and protect me. Once he heard I'm a virgin, - he wanted to touch my elders. - What elders? My chest. You've thought of it. - You must have. - Never. - Aunt. - Aunt? Aunt... Be careful of copyright. I said "Aunt." Do you want to strike up a conversation with me? Don't assume I don't know you're trying to chat me up. Do you think I like you? Oh, please. I've yet to settle my debts with you. Are they all mine? I bet more than half of them are yours. I'm sorry, pretty lady. Come on, Panther. This is not the way to cheat money. - Crazy. - Do you think you're very pretty? What are you laughing at? Is it funny? I'm a rapist? She is the rapist! Just tell me that you're driving a private taxi. Waiting for a driver? Hey, private taxis are illegal. We are running a legal service! The Government can't do anything about us too. - Why? Did the law change? - No. - Did our Government change? - No. It's the mindset of the people that has changed. Is it lawless now that the Elder is gone? It has nothing to do with the Elder. Even if he is still around, he can't do anything either. It's because the world has changed. The world is really different now. Panther. What else did you do after your release? Other companies won't hire us too. If you tell them the truth, they'll find you honest. Do you think I've never been honest? Why is there a two-year blank in your resume? During that period, I was serving... - National Service? - Serving my term. Term? Do you mind sharing? I don't mind sharing. Because I... was convicted under the Singapore Penal Code, Chapter 356, committed theft while causing hurt or wrongful restraint to others. In simpler terms? Robbery. I don't think you being in prison is the reason for their refusal. I was just as naive when I was first released. Listen... Darn it. Let me tell you, whatever I do next, don't you stop me. What's the matter? Panther, what's wrong? That's him. The boss who framed me. That's him. You just got out. Don't be rash. Are you asking me not to be rash? He got me into prison for so many years. How can I be calm? Panther. I'm warning you. Don't act recklessly. If you're my friend, don't stop me. Stand guard here. Don't be rash. Come back. - Sorry. - Take away your trotter. This is heaven's will, asking you to let go. You kicked my part down there and you still dare spew such rubbish. What if I can't have children next time? - I'll help you then. - You! Really, I... Are you all right? Forget it. Don't stop me anymore. Sorry! It's a good thing you're pretty. If not, I'll beat you up. Where's my rod? Panther. Hold this and shut up. I don't believe he's that lucky. That's lucky. Oh, crap. Serves you right. You're swelling up like a pig's head now. I told you it was heaven's will for you to let go. I'm just not satisfied. I suffered in prison, while he roamed free and had a good life. Don't be ignorant. The world has already changed. Why don't you change your point of view? He might actually be your benefactor. Benefactor? From what I see, you have been released. But your brain are still in prison. Use your pig brain and think about it. If he didn't sell you out, you would still be a part of their gang now. Whatever. If I meet him again, he won't be so lucky. One more. Free tissues? Do all costs go just to attract business? Do you not know what is "Tissue Chopper-logy"? Let's go. This is someone else's seat. Don't embarrass me. - Let's go. - Is this the great power of tissues now? Let's sit here. Sit. Sit down. So is this how you use tissues now? What shall we eat? Buy from the store with the longest queue, of course. That aunt with no business is quite pitiful. Let's buy from her. No way. Her food must be horrible. to begin with. You just got out of prison. Do you still want to eat horrible food? That makes sense. Aunt. Two plates. Two plates? You just won't listen. How is Mad Dog now? Him? We had some fun the first few days after our release. After that, he appears and disappears like a ghost. Occasionally, he's uncontactable. Why is that so? Is he gambling again? About that, you have to ask the ghost. Only he can answer. Why? Because I'm a human and he's a gambling ghost. We're from different departments. Your sense of humor has improved tremendously. I can't help it. It's in my DNA. Your order is here. How do you prepare it so fast? It must have been cooked ages ago. Thank you. Those who are pitiful must have a case for having sunk to their lows. This really tastes bad. No wonder she has no business. Just be happy you have something to eat. Give Mad dog a call. I'll try again after I finish. Three packets for two dollars. Take a look. Thank you. Speak of the devil. Thank you. Mad Dog. Tiger? What happened? Where are your legs? Diabetes. They have been amputated. Thank you. You will strike the lottery. Who is taking care of you now? I have no one at home. No money. No health. I have nothing. Who says you have nothing? What else do I have? You have your illness. Get lost. Thank you. You will win first prize in the lottery. Mad Dog. Even if you have nothing, you still have us as your friends. Where do you stay? I'll send you home. I'm staying there. Come. Thank you. Your kindness will be rewarded. Darn it. - Go back. - Panther, what is he saying? Let's go. Stop running! Stop running! - Chrysanthemum tea. Do you want some? - No. How can you do such shameless things? Why can't I do them? This is a profitable business and it's not illegal. I'm not a beggar. I sell tissues. I'm a businessman. I pay taxes. You guys won't understand. This is an art. This is called the art of trickery. Beggar. Beggar? Look at me. Do I look like I have stage two cancer? Third stage. This is called professionalism. I am an actor. I graduated from Mediacork's acting class. Anyway, for Singaporeans who are guilty of bad deeds, they buy tissues from me to make amendments for themselves. You just got out. You won't understand. Come on, let's catch up at my place. The loan sharks don't know where I'm staying. Why are they after you? Are you still gambling? Just a little bit. Come on. Panther Why? Are you not going to pick up your phone? There's no need to. It's a prank call. I heard that you're a well-known tutor. You teach mathematics with a unique method. Our tuition center needs talents like you. Why don't you try solving this sum? Sure. This pen uses friction to erase its ink. This is a marvelous pen. Mistakes can be corrected. I wonder if humans can do so too. Of course, we can. What mistakes have you done? There's nothing. I don't believe you. Be honest with me. No, there's nothing at all. Try this out. No problem. You're very fast. You're hired. Thank you. You're hurting me. Thank you. It stinks inside but out there, it's heavenly. Are you still calling? It won't go through. Don't waste your efforts. Maybe he's busy. Panther, keep calling. You want me to cook and call at the same time. Stop only when he picks up. Let's eat. These home-cooked meals look so delectable in your hands. Looks might be deceiving. Let me try it out for myself. That's unexpected. The food you make looks good and tastes good. My mom was a great cook. I picked up some tips from her. When we were in prison, these dishes were taught to us by... That person, the one who taught us cooking. Joey. She taught us these dishes. - You remember them? - Of course. If I were sensible back then, I would have been a restaurant owner now. Since the three of us are jobless, why don't we open a food stall? That's good. We can sell seafood dishes. Are you nuts? Hot wok frying? You'll need to know at least 50 to 60 dishes. I know. We should sell Japanese ramen. Ramen is good. In the restaurants, they just put some vegetables, some meat, and some egg and they would charge ten dollars at least. I'm good with Chinese-style cooking. Japanese ramen? I can't do that. Didn't you mention Joey earlier? We can ask her for help. That makes sense. Do you have money? I don't. Do you? No, you? Yes, but I used them up for your debts. There are no other choices. (Prayer) What are you doing? Shush. I'm calling my dad. Don't interfere with my signal. (Prayer) Ladies and gentlemen. The top ten most disgusting Hokkien noodles in Singapore. And the winner, number one, goes to... Grandma! Grandma, come here. Congratulations. You've come on top. What am I ranked top in? In the worst tasting Hokkien noodles. Number one. Don't go, Grandma. Tell us, Grandma, how to cook such horrible tasting Hokkien noodles. Do you need a lot of skills? Grandma, hurry, say something. - Say something to the audience. - Don't shoot me. Are you two youngsters ganging up on an elderly? I'm a reporter and my job is to tell the truth. And the truth is, Grandma's noodles are horrible. Are you not happy? Why don't you cook Grandma's Hokkien noodles for me? What a crowd. Darn it, what is this up and down? - In and out? - Where's Tiger? He's behind us. - Hi. - Hello. Sorry. Does Grandma's Hokkien noodles taste awful? Why don't I cook my noodles for you? Are you raising the stakes? How can we reject that? Can you fry noodles? Don't embarrass us. I'll slip off if anything goes wrong. Your Hokkien noodles are delicious. Grandma, we'll definitely give you free promotions. Ladies and gentlemen, good news! We have an amazing discovery. Long time no see, Joey. Long time no see. Your skills are still as good. Not fair. You were always praising him back then. Now that we're out, you still won't praise us. We're all your students. You must have given him special tips, right? He's hardworking. - You're biased. - You're heartless. Even if I'm heartless, I have more heart than Jian Ren. That's enough. Joey, have a seat. Aren't you guys four-in-one? Where's Jian Ren? Maybe he went back to prison. He's uncontactable. Joey. Actually, we asked you out today because we have some queries. We're so close. Just skip the formalities. What is it? We would like to rent a stall to sell food. But we're not sure where to start. We have no funds too. That's true. Just the deposit would be quite a sum. I'll look around for you guys. Young man. Do you want to rent a stall? Why not rent my stall? I'll give it to you for free. Did I hear wrongly? I'm getting old and want to retire soon. Your cooking skills are marvelous too. Just take and manage my stall. But you have to pay the rent. Of course. (Prayer) Dad, so you've been listening. Your dad is really efficient. Can you introduce him to me? I would like to get some numbers from him. If I hit the jackpot, I will be rich. Sorry. My dad hates gamblers. Hurry up and say thank you to Grandma. - Thank you, Grandma. - Thank you. Don't think that you're useless Don't just sit there and stare at the sky If you are not willing to move, who else can help to fulfill your dreams? Don't think that you're useless Don't let inferiority stop your advancement Everyone has different ways of contributing Maybe yours is the best way Many times, we do not know How much exactly is our worth What should we do To not waste this life Do we matter or do we not? We are small in this universe What we have hidden in us Will others find it laughable? Panther Don't think nothing of your worth Don't just sit there and stare at the sky If you are not willing to move, who else can help to fulfill your dreams? Don't think that you're useless Don't let inferiority stop your advancement Everyone has different ways of contributing Maybe yours is the best way We just started. Let's go say hi to our neighbors. We should. Let's go. - Hello. - Hello. Hello. Is it your first day today? I don't really know what you are selling. We're selling ramen. Ramen? I like eating ramen. It's our first day and they're our neighbors. Let's support them. Please give us three bowls of minced meat noodles. What? Let me treat you. How can we do that? Why not? I'll treat you to ramen too. Sure. Dear, three bowls of minced meat noodles. Delicious. Ridiculous. We treated them and she asked me to go to hell? That's "delicious" in Japanese. If it's horrible, won't she ask us to go to hell? It means "this is fabulous." Right, your soup is super fabulous. My husband is from Northeast China. Our soup is regionally popular. Try it. Be honest. How is it? It's not bad. Your soup is also to die for. Our soups have potential swings at perfection. Am I wrong? Swings are found in the playground. It should be, "We both have our strengths." Wishing you guys a business prosperous. Shouldn't it be "a prosperous business"? They're laughing at you. They're joking. They're selling this kind of MSG-infused soup. Within one week, we'll send them to hell. It'll be our stall with the long queues up to the boundaries. It has been two weeks. We've only sold four bowls today. We had 18 flies passing by though. They didn't even stop. But those four customers said our noodles were delicious. Do you know what this is called? Good reviews but fetch no sales. Look, they have such long queues for selling MSG soup. This is called good sales without good reviews. Why not think of something instead of grumbling? How can we get good reviews and sales? As long as it's not illegal, I'll do it. You're the one who said it. You said it. Japanese Ramen Discount Papa said he wants a bowl of ramen Mama said, watch out for salt content I took a walk around the food court Minced meat noodles, saltiest of all Papa said we should eat healthier food Mama said the price should not be too high I took a walk around the food court The food court And I just ended up here Oh, Japanese Ramen Really fabulous ramen Tasty and healthy Superb with less salt content Ladies and gentlemen, we're going into the climax.

Are you selling noodles or selling songs? I think you're selling your body with no results. I am selling my voice. My singing voice. I am just so talented. The government said to change plans if business was bad. They didn't ask you to change gender. Darn it. Are you saying I'm transgender? Forget it. You want a fight, don't you? We trained before. I'm from Shaolin. I'm from Mount Emei. Mount Emei? I think you're a mountain goose. Dear, he said I'm a mountain goose. I'm obviously a royal phoenix. I'm a phoenix. I'll fight it out with him. - I'll kill you! - Come, fight me! - Come on! Try fighting me! - I'll beat you to death! - Have a taste of this! - Bring it on! - I'll kill you! - Beat me if you can! Enough. Stop this if you don't want us to go back to prison. What are all of you doing? Why are you shooting me? It's none of your business. Stop shooting. I've told you this before. This is the digital age. Go inside. You'll get used to it soon. I'm already used to it. Shoot me. Take all you want. I'm fine with it. It would be best if you can put it on the web. I'll pose for you. - How petty. - He's crazy. Come on. MRT? Brother Tiger, we finally met. There's a haze now. What's up? You're acting gloomy here. Sit. Sit. Don't be so courteous. Sit. Brother Tiger. We had some conflicts back then. After all, we were young and reckless. We entered prison around the same time. But our dates of release were different. They said it would be a ten-year sentence. But after deducting weekends and public holidays, I couldn't tell when you would be released. I really miss you. So... Whenever I'm free or have nothing to do, I'll come over here and take a look at your window to see if you're inside. I've been waiting for you. See? I've got goosebumps from my own words. I'm warning you. If you want trouble, just look for me. Don't you touch my family. Don't be so agitated. I'm just here to reminisce. Let's meet again when we have the chance. You can continue your gloomy act. I'm going. Bye. Why didn't you come back last night? I am talking to you. Do you want to wake everyone up? Are you speechless? I'm going to shower. I have something to say to you. I have nothing to say to you. Guang. Excuse me. The door is closing. Sorry. Guang, listen to me please. Listen to me. We are dad and son, not enemies. Why can't we talk properly? Does it have to be this way? Can't you see the people here? Do you want to put up a show for them? They don't understand what I'm saying. Stop finding excuses. You look so fierce. You obviously want to shame me. Fine. I'll speak nicely to you. I'm coming over to speak to you. Must it be now? Oh, dear. It is heaven's will. Do you see it? Even the gods want us to have a good talk. I know I've been in prison and let you down. But I'm here to compensate and make up for you. Is that wrong? Why won't you give me a chance? What do you want from me? What should I do? What can I do? You don't have to do anything. We're here. - Guang. - Gosh! Would it kill you to come a bit later? You guys are usually so slow. You guys are ridiculous. Don't worry. You need time and patience to teach children. I understand your suffering. So that's it for today. All right? Bye, guys. See you on Monday, okay? Bye. Enjoy your weekend, okay? Bye. Hi. This is so shocking. I didn't know you had such a background. I've asked you before and you said no. It's okay. You know I really like your style of teaching. But all the parents said that if you stay, they will leave. I've calculated your students. A total of 38 students. And most of them are females. What can I do? I really don't know. I really would like you to stay. But we're running a tuition center, not a prison. I helped all their kids improve from F to A. Can't the parents give me a chance? I totally understand. But do you know? We have this parent support group. Whatever the parents say, the rest of them will just agree. I'm caught in the middle. Never mind. I understand. I'll quit. This is not what I mean. What do you mean? Do you mean you'll give me a chance? This is not what I meant either. Then, what do you mean? I'm a compassionate person. I'll let you continue until the end of the month. Oh, my goodness. I forgot that it's the 30th today. There's no 31st this month, right? I'll pack up and leave right away. I like you. I like you very much. I'm so sorry, I didn't know it was the 30th today. I swear. Dear God. I've attended Sunday school since I was young. I go to church every Sunday. I pray before I eat or sleep. We should be very familiar with one another. But you seemed to not know me. Every time something good happens to me, you'll pull me back and trip me. Do you not like me? I contributed funds to my church. I happily prepared for my wedding. And out comes a prostitute under the age of 17. I know. For those below 16, even if she agrees, I still have broken the law. If she is 17 and she agrees, it's not a crime. However, if I give her money, then it's a crime. Oh my god, what kind of law is this? I'm most familiar with your laws. I know the bible inside out. There's a prostitute inside the bible too. And you allowed her to wash your feet for you. You forgave her. What about me? I didn't enter the bridal chamber. I entered prison. Okay, now that I'm out, I can't teach in school. You brought me to a tuition center. But you allowed the parents to find out about my past. God, are you playing with me? What do you want me to do? God, I'm sorry. But where are you? Lord, give me a sign. Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Don't disturb him. Come to the back. I'll get you some food. God! - It is divided by A. It is. - It's not. It's not like that. It is like that. I'm telling you. AOB is a triangle. Take this, minus the triangle, and that's the answer. No, you should use AO minus OB. No, use YO minus AB. The teacher said to use AO minus OB. No, the teacher said to use YO minus AB. The teacher had already said so. Weren't you listening? You're the unattentive one. You're always playing with your phone. Go ask God if you don't believe me. Don't ask God, ask me. God won't help you. You're wrong. You're wrong too. Oh, my god. I'll do it once for you guys. Find the area of the shaded region. First, find the area of AOB. Minus one-third. - How much? - Six. - Minus? Two six. One six. - Two six. One six. Just like that. Uncle, we couldn't understand what our teacher said. You teach really well. Why don't you go for tuition if you don't understand? We're not very wealthy. We have no money for tutors. Will you be here often? I should be here quite often. - Bye, uncle. - Bye. I can't believe that I'll meet you here. When they saw you, it was like they met an angel. What's the point? Once those parents know about my past, I will change from an angel to a devil. If you know about others' past, would you give them a chance? I heard that after your release, Tiger and the rest can't contact you. You look down on them, right? I know that you're a graduate and a teacher. They are just gangsters. To you, you guys are of different classes. Back in prison, for the sake of survival, you had to be with them. You hope that others can give you a chance, but you won't even give your friends a chance. The magnanimous gesture of forgiveness is more than just talk. You have to act on it. Joey, you are not the one going through my predicament. It's easy to talk. You've never been in prison and suffered like me. All you have is just theory. Theory, you know? I don't think you understand. Joey, what are you doing? What are you doing? Don't frame me again. No! Help, rapist. Do you recognize this symbol? This is a symbol of me being a triad member last time. Look here. This is a scar from one of my gang fights. Did you get cut here when you were in a gang fight? And they cut you over here too? No. The other scar is from my appendicitis. I didn't ask you to look there. I used to be what everyone called a female gangster. Got locked up in a girls' home for a few years too. But I'm back on my feet. It was tough back then, but I'm over it. I managed to do it. So why can't you? Whatever past we have, they're all over and unchangeable. The only change we can control is our future. You are more educated and should make more sense. Look, we're in the headlines. Oh dear, so they're ex-convicts. No wonder they have such bad tempers and are so crude. Don't say that. Actually, our tones weren't nice too. But they stole our business. To survive, we must have real abilities. If I were capable, I could invite Jay Chou here too. Let's not talk about this. Look at the headlines. If I had known, I would wear my scarlet red blouse. I would wear my Birkin bag too. This one is too small. How unlucky to see this news while checking lottery results. Ex-Convict Opens Ramen Stall, Fights in the Cafe It's a good thing. It's costly to be in the headlines. Isn't free publicity good? The whole nation knows my shame now. And you're still being sarcastic here? Be more civilized. Have some culture. Do you two still want to be on the papers? Do you think I'm dead? Are you trying to smoke here? The boss didn't say anything. Why are you so jumpy? It's not that he's not saying a thing. He's too scared to. Drink your coffee. Pack up. It's time to go. Such thick black coffee. My inspiration is here. Are you still gambling? Are you betting on horses? What year is this? People gamble online now. Uncle, can we take a photo with you? Okay. One, two, three. Dear, look. They have fans. - Thank you. - Let me take a look. Did you see that? If we didn't get in the headlines, how would your Brother Tiger be so famous? I got the video from Coffeeboy to put online. Aren't I smart? This is worse than loan sharks splashing paint on my house. Country bumpkin. Forget it. Mad Dog, why are you going crazy again? - Joey. - Hi Joey. Hi. Boss, Panther, Mad Dog. Hi Jian Ren. Jian Ren. We finally see you. Joey. You're amazing to be able to contact him. Which service provider do you use? Joey. Your signal seems to be exceptionally strong. So amazing. Don't be like that. I was really busy. Busy avoiding us? I'm sorry. I really had no time. Now it's us who have no time. You're upset he's gone and upset now that he's back. What exactly do you guys want? I... We're all good friends. What can't we talk about? I would like to join you guys again. Join us? You must have faced some obstacles outside. Yes. Ex-convicts like us are not easily accepted by society. That's true. No worries. As long as we work hard together, we can get our business up again. - Right? - Right. Right, your video from that day went viral online. Now that Jian Ren is here, let him think of a way to incorporate it into your marketing. You might get famous. Right, in this era, we have to start marketing on social media. It's good that you guys were caught on video. It'll help us. Japanese Ramen, Delicious. Hold My Hand and Have a Good Appetite. This is so fresh. Do you want to die? Eating it before it's washed? Don't worry. Our vegetables are grown using a hydro-powered soil-based vertical farming system and cultivated under a controlled environment, minimizing pests and so the use of harmful pesticides is reduced. We, ex-convicts, also adopted the system of eight men in a cell. We were also cultivated under a controlled environment. What cultivation? We are ex-convicts. Come on, you pests. Come on. Other than vegetables, we can supply fresh eggs and fish too. From ordering to delivery, it'll only take a few hours. We can guarantee the freshness of our goods. Besides lodging, we provide hanging and caning services too. From conviction to execution, it takes more than a few years. So I can guarantee that we're definitely not fresh. I trust you guys can come up with this. How is it? Not a bad introduction right? Nowadays, many fear death and are concerned about the nutritional value and food safety. I think we should really emphasize this on our social media to let the netizens know that we're serious about this. Dear, look! We're losing our customers. - Teacher. - Teacher. Why are you guys here? We had a hard time finding you. Good thing we saw your posts online. So we came here for you. Yes, I posted the ads. How did you do for your exams? Did you bring your classmates here? We want you to teach us. Are you that good? Is he really good? But boys, I am selling ramen. How can I teach you? Since these kids are here, just help them out. Redeem yourself. Why not order one bowl of ramen each? I'll let him tutor you for free. He'll listen to me. Okay? Okay. I sold five bowls of ramen. Take a seat. I'll send your ramen and tutor over soon. Just a thought. Parents usually tag along for their kids' tuition classes. If the parents are here too, won't we sell ten more bowls? If their grandparents come too, that will be 20 bowls. This is awesome. Actually, I had this idea long ago. When I was still at the tuition center, there were parents who waited for their kids to finish classes. Take a look. This is great. Kids having tuition here. Parents can relax and have some food. So my idea is meant to be used here. Beautiful. Your idea is not bad. But it's not enough. There can be more improvements. Why? We have to think of another way to work together. You teach. He cooks. And you... I manage the cashier. I can give the parents a massage. - Massage. - Massage. Okay, you take care of the males. I'll take the females. Can you be fairer? All right, then I'll sacrifice a bit. You take the males and aunts above the age of 50. I'm in charge of all the young females. Okay, you win. Tiger. Brother Blackie, hello. Not bad. I thought you were trying to avoid me. So you're here selling ramen. Not bad. It's just a small business. Why are you here? My son's friend told me there's an amazing tutor here. So I brought him here. I heard it's free too. Mister, so you're here because it's free? This old man. Does he not know me? - He doesn't. - He really doesn't? - Really. - It's all right then. Everybody! I'm in a good mood today. So I'm treating all of you to ramen. Who wants some? Raise your hands. - I want some. - I want some. Thank you. Don't worry. We should help each other, right? Right. Where is that amazing tutor? Introduce us. - Jian Ren. - Hi, Brother Blackie. Is it you? Come here. I put my son's future entirely in your hands. You flatter me. I hope that you'll change his F to an A. I'll try. Brother Blackie, please sit. I'll get some ramen for you. Is it nice? While you feast later, the kids can continue their tuition. Is this arrangement good? Will I have to wait long? Won't it be boring? Definitely not. If you're bored, we have massage services too. - There's a massage here? - Yes, we have it. Who? Is it you? Sorry. I'll only provide massages, no other special services. This is really creative. We're doing this so when parents send their kids for tuition, they won't be bored. I have an idea. Do you want to invest in us? Tiger. On the day of your release, I went to fetch you as I wanted you to join my moving company. But you ignored me and kept walking. Today, my company wishes to invest in your business. You better not ignore me again. I thought you were still with the triads. I didn't know you opened a Blackie moving company. What nonsense! When I opened this company five years ago, business was so good. Look at this. It keeps going up. It has never dropped. Although most of my employees are ex-convicts and they sometimes look like good-for-nothings, they have all turned over a new leaf. We've even been featured on the news. That's true. I saw it. You gave me a great idea the other day. I'm sure it'll become a huge business. Parents bringing their kids for tuition. While they wait for classes to end, where do they go? Your idea is the answer to this question. I've planned it out for you. We'll call it the "Triple Nourishment Center." First, nourish your grades. Secondly, nourish your health. Finally, nourish your stomach. I'll put in money while you guys put in the effort. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. - Let's do it. - Okay. This is yours. Take these cordyceps and ginkgo chicken essence for nourishment. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. It's most important to have vigor. Then your business will be good. Right? - Yes! - Yes! May we work well together. Mr. Low. I'm very flabbergasted and surprised that one child of yours can bring in two handphones and a tablet to school. Which I... Let me restart. I feel that your child bringing two handphones and one tablet to school will affect his learning and at the same time, affect his classmates. Principal, you see. I bought all these for him. I didn't know that students can't bring these to school. I'll take note next time. I'll take note next time. Sorry for the trouble caused. I don't need you to cover up for me. I have nothing to hide. I bought these using money I earned. Anyway, he's not my dad. Why did you ask him here? What? He's not your dad? Hey! What's wrong with you? Am I not your dad? Do you have the right to be my dad? Where were you all these years? You were in prison! I've contacted your mom. She will bring you over to Australia. I have my own life. Where I stay is up to me. I don't need you to be a busybody. Your life is such a mess. How dare you try to arrange mine? You have no right. During these past ten years, when Mom and I needed you, where were you? Since I was young, I've told myself I have no dad. Do you think you can control me now that you're released? I'm a hero. What rights do you have over me? After Mom ran off, I lost everything. But I'm already used to life without you two. Why must you come and disturb me now? Aren't you already accustomed to prison life? Why did you come out? MRT? Mad Dog. I heard your debts are long overdue. Do you have no intention to return what you owe? Are these two your men? Does it matter whose men they are? I heard that you've partnered up to run a big business now. You have money for business, but no money to return to me? You're not respecting us private banks. That business isn't mine. My friends came up with the money. I'm a worker. I'll definitely return what I owe you. I can't hold joss sticks. I pray to God. You pray to God? I heard you were still praying with joss sticks last week. You pray to God? You can start praying when I hit you. I was joking. Please bless me with first prize. - I was joking. - It's not funny. I said I was just joking. I'm just hitting you for fun. Nice. We've been in prison together for so long. Once a friend, always a friend. Help me with something. And I'll cancel all your debts. How's that? I love you. - Is everyone ready? - Yes! - One, two, three, may we prosper. - One, two, three, may we prosper. In life Don't be afraid to stumble You have no choice But to stand up and fight In life Failure is the first step to success To surrender is cowardly Face it with courage This way. Keep walking, continue dreaming This is not the end of the road Don't you worry, don't be sad In the dark, you'll find helping hands Take deep breaths, march right on Don't be afraid to stumble once more Head forward, don't look back Only in darkness, can you see the stars Hi, how did you find our center? This place is good. The teacher is good too. There is food, drinks, and massages. It feels like home. There's free coffee too. We'll come here next time too. Go ahead. You two are well-known tutors in the industry. What do you have to say about this new tuition concept? This idea is very modern. There is tuition, food, drinks, and massages. After sending their kids for tuition, parents won't be bored. This concept might be a trend for all tuition centers. Congratulations. - Thank you. - Thank you. Not bad. I have confidence in you. Thank you for your support. You really are our benefactor. You're welcome. Look, most of your waiters are ex-convicts. You are their benefactor. Such a pity I can help others, but not my own son. Take it slow. Although I have retired from the triads, I still have connections there. I'll ask them to look out for your son. Don't worry. Thank you. Today is an auspicious date for moving. I need to get back to help out. I'm leaving. - I'm leaving. - See you. - Work hard. - Goodbye. Jian Ren, did you see Guang? No. Don't worry, he should be on his way. There are reporters outside. Let's head over there. Am I really going to betray my friends? Mad Dog. We're so busy outside. What are you doing here? Are you slacking? Bring this out. We're running out of drinks. Can I not do it? I might as well depend on myself. I'll do it. That drink... - The drinks are here. - Panther. Tina. What happened? What's the matter? What's happening? Why look at me? It's not me. What does it have to do with me? - Go help. - Okay. Call for an ambulance. Why are these people vomiting? What happened? What should we do? I don't know either. Don't panic. We'll think of something. I've called the ambulance. We'll inform you once the test results are out. Thank you. We have just started and now we have to close for two weeks to wait for the report. What happened? We were definitely sabotaged. We have CCTV in the kitchen. Let's take a look for clues. - Come on. - Come on. Tiger. Brother Blackie. What happened? Where is Tiger going? You've always wished your dad was back in prison, right? I'm giving you a chance now. Put this in his kitchen. I guarantee you, he'll be back in prison. He might even get a death sentence. No one will bother you anymore then. Don't worry. It's like how you helped me with my deliveries. Don't be a coward. Why did you do this? Why spike our drinks? Look. Just because I'm sending you to Australia, are you framing me? I'm your dad. I didn't do it. Drugs? Are you peddling drugs? Guang, stop! Stop right now! Guang! - Guang, Boss wants to see you. - I'll look for him later. Do we need to make an appointment? Come. - Let go of me. - Guang! - Guang! - Go. Tiger, stop. That's Grasshopper, MRT's sidekick. - What are you doing? - Calling the police. No, we can't. Guang has drugs on him. Drugs? Did MRT look for you recently? Could he be the one responsible? Tiger. I was the one who spiked the drinks. I had no choice. MRT forced me to. I owe him 30 thousand dollars. He'll chop off my limbs and my part down there if I don't return the money. Are you still gambling? Is your mind full of crap? - It's you. Because of you... - Don't just blame me. All right. Stop it. Brother Blackie. Is there any way we can find MRT? I have an idea. Come with me. Mad Dog of Geylang I've sealed them away for years. My trusty comrade. It's time for us to make our reappearance. Why don't you appear in prison then? How can we use these? Just having them is a crime. You just want to be locked up again, right? It's a gang fight. Do you think we're going house-visiting? Thank you. I got it. MRT is now at Pier Eight. I'll send some of my men there to rescue Guang. Brother. You retired from the triad ages ago, but you haven't sent in your arms? Brother Blackie. Thank you for your help. I'll settle my son's problems on my own. It has not been easy for you to keep clean. Don't break the law again. You make it sound like our brotherhood is worth nothing. I am telling you, I am definitely going. - Don't go. - I must go. - Don't go. - I must go. - Don't go. - Okay, I won't go. Okay. My friend's son is in trouble. Let the few of us handle it. If you treat me as a friend... Brother Blackie. If you treat me as a friend, then don't go. And don't call the police. What do you guys know? You are but a few prawns. You're scared of breaking the law and aren't bringing weapons. How are you going to fight them? Bringing weapons but not getting caught is easy. But you must listen to me. Trusty comrades. Shut up! Are you crazy? Why don't you just talk? These are gestures used by the special forces. Their purpose is to confuse the enemies. Now, we're confused too. Only the ghosts will know what you're saying. Okay, I'll explain. Listen up. We'll split into teams of two. One left, one right. You head to the front to distract them. I'll outflank them. Outflank. This is not "outflanking." This is "out of this world." - Can we start now? - Okay. Standby. We're here now. It's huge. Where's Guang? Slowly. Don't be nervous. Stay calm. Look for a door. It should be on your left. If it's not on your left, then look right. If it's not on your right, then look forward. If it's not in front, it can't be behind you, right? Because you came from there. And most importantly, it can't be from the top. Because the ceiling is on top, there's no door there. Brother Blackie, I really want to kick your down there now. What did he say? He didn't say anything. You spoke for so long but didn't get anything? He said something but he might as well not. Useless information. Talk rubbish. Yes. That is Guang's voice. - Can't you get such a small thing done? - Hold it. Keep calm. I'm going to save him. Hold onto me. Okay. - Be careful. - Hold onto me. Keep quiet. Okay. I see Guang. Release. Release a bit more. Release. A bit more. Release. A bit more. There's no more rope. Release. We can't. Release what you can. Release. Release what you can. Hurry. There's nothing. It's your fault. I told you to buy ten meters, but you said eight meters is enough. Darn you. Hey, are you all right? Hello. The lift is broken. Throw a rope down and save me. Where's the rope? Hurry up. You guys are hilarious. My friends are stupid right? They're such retards. Walk. Guang! Guang! - Hey! - Hey! Don't move. Brother Tiger. Nice. I was going to look for you tomorrow, but you came today. And you knew where to find me. Pardon me, my leg hurts, so I can't stand for long. MRT, what do you want? Your son has been naughty and doesn't keep his word. He didn't do what he promised. Don't hurt my son. I'm not hurting him. I have high hopes for him. What do you want? Don't raise your voice at me. I have a weak heart. I'm a civilized man. If you kneel and speak to me, I believe the ambiance will be a lot better. - Tiger. - Mad Dog. You've always been a hero. Look at you. Are you begging me now? I'm not a hero. You're not a hero? I heard you're sending him to Australia. Why? My ex-wife is there. I can't take care of my son. I hope that when Guang is there, his mom will take care of him. What a great dad. Did you hear that? I saw you running up and down, just to save your son. I'm very touched. You can give 100 percent for your son. What about me? Can I be a great dad like you? You definitely can. I can't. I don't have the chance anymore. You listen up. You wounded my leg. I'll treat it as part of the triad feuds. You became the prosecution witness to lock me up for eight years. During those eight years, my son was left alone with no one to care for him. And he got killed. Scram! In memory of beloved son. Born March 5th, 1995 Before he died, he said he hated his dad. Because his dad was in prison, no one could save him. He was just following your path. It's nobody else's business. That kind of dad will beget the same kind of son. Like father, like sun. Shut up if you don't know it, okay? Father and sun? Don't make me flare up. Did I say it wrongly? It's "like father, like son." Not "sun." Stop laughing, okay? Okay. No gangster would want his son to follow his path. That includes Tiger. What about your wife? Your wife... Where the heck is your wife then? How did you know? When my son died, she followed him to hell too. Do you see these colors on me? I turned all my anger, grudges, and frustrations into multiple colors and wore them for everyone to see. The prison wardens knew of our grudges. So they separated us. Now that we're out, killing you is as easy as killing an ant. But then I thought, this is not fair to me. I want you to experience the pain of losing your child. Take it up on me. Don't drag my son into this. The drugs are enough to get him a death sentence. My son was sentenced to death by you. We've been in prison for so long. Let bygones be bygones. Please. I beg of you to let it go. We had been inside for a long time. I'm tired too. You said it. It's time to let go. So I'll let go now. - Guang! - Tiger! Guang. It is so wrong to simply say that moms are the best in the world. Because dads are wonderful too. This show is getting more exciting. Let's play something old-school now. The majority against the minority. Prepare your weapons. We're starting. Panther. Do you have anything better? These are useless. - Wait. - I need to get things ready. - This shield is for you. - Hold this. This is for face washing. This is for attacking. How would I know how to use this? It's simple. Excuse me. Let me teach him. Like this. You can change hands. The purpose is not to let anyone near you. Move away or it'll hit you. Hold it. Like this? Just like this? You win. I taught him. Attack! Don't come near me! I'm just a teacher. There's no need to be so violent. Let's talk it out nicely. Go. Wait. Do you know who I am? I'm Mad Dog from Geylang. How dare you hit me? You would really hit me? Darn it. Even you? I'll shoot. Just shoot. - It's fake. - Fake? Darn you. Scram! After him! I didn't study much. Don't force me. How much longer do you need? Die! Length is strength. Your knife movements are really quick. We, ex-convicts, are not sick men of Asia. See that? He's bullying his elders. Let go. - Guang! - Let go of me. - Guang! - Self-defense. You're disrespectful towards the elderly. Where can you run to? Let go! Guang! Run! Are you trying to escape? Mad Dog? You look so frail. Don't be deceived by my appearance. You must be sick of life. Die! You like to gang up on people, right? We'll fulfill this wish of yours. Idiot. Welcome to our Triple Nourishment Center. Nourish your brains. Nourish your stomach. Nourish your part down there. Die! Police! You can't go in. I called the police. They're my friends. - You guys are out. - Brother Blackie. This is the first time in my life I've called the police. I told you not to do it but you went and did it. You should have done it earlier. It's just like in the movies. The police only arrive when the fights have ended. Where's Tiger? Tiger. Is your son all right? That's good. He's all right. They're good guys. Let's go. Let's go. Dad. I'm sorry. I got you into this. I was foolish to dream of becoming a hero. But... It's no use crying over your mistakes. Be brave and face them. Don't run away. Remember. Being able to control your fate makes you a hero. You can't just admit to any crimes. We can arrest you for providing false statements. What is it? Those youngsters alleged that Guang was peddling drugs. He thought he could outsmart the police and admitted that he was the one peddling drugs, not Guang. Do you think the police are idiots? I had no choice. I did it so Guang wouldn't be arrested. Aren't you afraid of going back to prison? Tiger is our friend. If his son has to be locked up at such a young age, I can't bring myself to see it happen. I would rather it be me than him. I'm used to it. Mad Dog, you're becoming more humane. Tiger would be pleased that you have such thoughts. Guang? Guang. Aunt, please take care of my dad. I will. Don't worry. How are you guys? Are you all right? No problem and we might even get an award. Yes, since we helped crack a drug syndicate. Do you know why? Why? Since we've come to this point, I can hide it no more. Actually, I am undercover. It's a tough job. Risking one's life by going through hails of bullets. Can't you spare me some attention? It's usually like this in movies. Two years later Is the seasoning for this dish complicated? No. It's because we use local produce. It's fresh, safe, and delicious. There's no need for heavy seasoning. It's the same with life. You don't need tricks as long as you have integrity. Let me test you. What is this new dish called? I know. It's called "Triple Fresh Fortune." - Brother Blackie. - Brother Blackie. It's so crowded. We're doing well. One of my best decisions in life is getting you guys to be my business partners. Thank you for letting us manage your new branch. We're a family. Please don't mention it. You two helped me out when I was released too. Thank you. What's important for a family is that we're all well and good. - Tiger. - This is for you. My greatest wish is good health for the two of you. It is time. Are we ready? Let's go. It's Guang. Guang. He's coming. - Hello. - He looks good. You have no choice but to stand up and fight You have no choice but to stand up and fight Dad. Look, they're all here. - Hello. - Guang. Let's go. To surrender is cowardly Face it with courage Keep walking, continue dreaming This is not the end of the road Don't you worry, don't be sad In the dark, you'll find helping hands Take deep breaths, march right on Don't be afraid to stumble once more Head forward, don't look back Only in darkness, can you see the stars In life Failure is the first step to success To surrender is cowardly Face it with courage Brother, look at our costumes. Are we on a rescue mission or a performance? Who tied it so tightly? Are you sure? Don't worry. I'm from the NDU. Night Delivery Unit? You watched too much Frogmen. I'm from the National Detention Unit. Please don't insult the real NDU. I know. "The only itchy day was yesterday." Action. Am I not very colorful? That's because... Action. Sorry. Sorry. We used this most... - Sorry. - What's wrong? We would just use glass here... I... Are you guys in cahoots? This guy told me he just came back from overseas. And is not accustomed to Singapore jobs. So I... Action. Chen Tian Wen took my first kiss. You won't know even if I told you. Let me tell you... Thank you, Brother Blackie. Today is an auspicious date for moving. I have to hurry home... Why would you hurry home? To move house. Go home to move house. Although most of my employees are ex-convicts, look at their appearances. They're like cartoon characters, all oddly shaped. Look at their odd shapes. Weird shapes. It's on the papers too. Don't joke about this. Are you listening to me? Darn it. You keep laughing. One more time. Your idea is to save them. He forgot the lines again. What else? Applause, please.
