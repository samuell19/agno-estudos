Vacation time in the United States means traveling. And traveling in the United States is wonderful. Fill your gas tank and hit the road. The big rolling freeways and the fantastic traffic patterns. Monuments to a civilization that moves on wheels. There's a turnoff to everywhere... ... and you can go straight ahead too, if you only know how. Some people go to the mountains or the shore... ... we packed two weeks' camping equipment in a trailer and headed south... ... to a place I'd never seen. And something happens to you when you cross the border into another country. It's exciting, even if it's only the country next door. Hello. Where do you going in Mexico? We stay here in Tijuana tonight. In the morning, we head south of Ensenada. A fishing trip. Turista pass. Born in the United States? And you? Thank you. Tijuana is fun, like a carnival. Strange people, strange words. You name it, and they've got it. It's a boomtown with tourists for oil wells. And if you want to build up your sales resistance... ... well, this is the place. Sombrero, se?or? - I never use them. - No? Shoes for the little boy? - Post cards? - No, thank you. Spider? Very pretty. Look. For the little boy. Music? - No, thanks. - No? Oh, horses, maybe. I know the man. He make good deal for you. Okay, boy. Just a minute. Watch the camera. Smile. That's it, boy. It'll be a lovely picture, se?ora. You'll like it, you'll see. Well, it's duty free. I'm saving money for you. Every time you save me money, you cost me money. You just don't understand the simplest facts. - Sexish. - The simplest facts. But don't they catch cold? - Oh, no. - For the little boy, maybe? No, he's getting a little too old for that sort of thing. Post cards? Very pretty. South of Tijuana, the highway settles down to a single winding tape of asphalt... ... and the country opens up. You don't have to worry which road to take. There's only one. It's marked, "Mexico 1," and the sign says, "Ensenada, 92 kilometers." That's about 60 miles. Say, honey... ...how about putting the top down after we get out in the country? - Won't blow too much. - Sure, it's a wonderful idea. It was a little foggy when we got to Ensenada. But even with the fog it has something... ... with its quiet harbor, its little lobster boats... ... and a sign, "Bienvenidos." That means welcome. It's the place where you fill your gas tank, check your tires. You'd better. It'll be a long time before you get another place to do it. When you see a map, you see what isolation you're heading into. Tijuana, Ensenada up at one end, and then 400 miles to La Paz... ... the only other town at the other end. In between, nothing but names. Oh, picturesque names. Mission Santo Tom?s, Colonia Guerrero, El Rosario... ... but just names. Ancient settlements and missions no longer existing, ghost towns, ruins. Below Ensenada, it's a road of dirt and desolation. A road of shifting sands and bruising rocks... ... of quail that scoot through clumps of cactus... ... and doves that rise in soft, whirring clouds. High adventure beckons down this road... ... but never again will it beckon to me. Turista pass. Keys to the back. You are Douglas Stilwin? You are Mrs. Stilwin? - This is your son? - Yes. He must be the boss, that fellow. He's a captain, or maybe even a colonel, I don't know. Dad, what's going on? Go ahead. Say, Dad, what was going on back there? Well, I'll tell you, sonny. Somebody probably lost a goat or a cow or something. - Mexicans have a way of taking things big. - Mexicans? Why, you and Bobby acted as if you hadn't seen a police car in your lives. Oh, Mom, you always treat me like a kid. I wonder why. - What was it really? - Who knows? Checking stolen cars, looking for contraband, I don't know. What difference does it make? - You could've asked. - Never would've told me. - How do you know? - Four years in the Army. They never tell you. Besides, I didn't want them to go poking around in that zippered bag. Why not? Oh, Doug, what did you bring this thing for? - Is it loaded? - Certainly not... ...but there's a clip of bullets in the case. Helen, it's not a bad thing to have. It is pretty desolate country down here. You never know. Never fired it once in the Army. Thought we might pop off a can or two, huh, Bobby? You bet. And maybe we'll need it for protection. Who knows what perils there are down here. - Honey, we'll use it for target practice. - Well, don't use me for the target. What are you smiling about? Nothing, nothing at all. I love you. Well, I love you too, but what are you smiling at? Cut it out. Will we get to the ocean in time for lunch, Pop? I hope so. Gosh, we must have hit a nest of rattlesnakes. And they all landed in the radiator. It's boiling again. There's a place ahead where we can pull off. We'll get a chance to use that five-gallon water can of ours. - Well, that is... - What's the matter, Mom? Well, the fact is, it's empty. What? Who was the vice president in charge of the water can? Doug, I'm sorry. I forgot to tell you to fill it at the last service station. Gee, Mom, you didn't forget? Yes, I goofed off, but it's really no problem. Of course not. We'll probably run into a 50-pump gasoline station any minute. We'll get plenty of water. Why, I think I see one right up ahead right now. Where, Dad, where? Pay no attention to your father, son. He's just being humorous. Dad, this is no time for jokes. Why, we might be in perils. - Are we, Mom? - No, darling. Look, "Garaje, water." Two people per square mile. I live right. Well... ...it may not be 50 pumps, but we'll get some water. Maybe we can even get something to eat. I'm going to order a nice ice-cold glass of tea... ...breast of chicken salad, with just a touch of lettuce and watercress. Say, that's pretty good, Dad. Oh, look, fiesta. - That was two days ago. - They should be back. Takes them three days to get over a fiesta. - What's a fiesta? - A feast day. Feast day. Gee, I'm starved. We'll have lunch at the beach. If we ever get there. We were looking for water, amigo, remember? - You look around the back, Bobby. - Okay. Let's see, tires, tubes, stuff like that. - I've got some, I've got some. - That's a good boy. Least we can do for them. See that rock formation up ahead? Those funny-looking boulders? - What about them? - I remember them. - We're getting closer. - I'm glad we're getting close to something. What a memory, Dad. Look at the quail. I suppose you recognize some of them too. Seems like only yesterday Joe and I were scouting... ...looking for some of the best fishing and hunting. Those were the days. What an outing. Tell about it, Dad. Whatever became of Joe? He probably never survived the outing. Doug, are you sure we're on the right road? - Positive. - You could have asked, couldn't you? Why should I ask when I know? Is it beneath your dignity to ask directions? Mom, it ain't... - Isn't. - Isn't his dignity. Dad just knows, that's all. There she is. Turnoff for the beach is just a little further down the road. This is a road? Honey, we're almost over the worst of it now. In a few minutes you'll be swimming in that surf. Think of all that wonderful privacy. I'd enjoy the wonderful privacy of a nice bubble bath right at the moment. Mom, you always think about civilization. Don't knock it, son. Just get a whiff of that air. Honey, you're gonna love it. There's the beach. That's where Joe and I camped, there at the base of that jetty. - Who lives in those houses, Doug? - Nobody. They've been empty for years. Picked clean. - It's beautiful. - How do we get down there? There's a road down the side of the bluff. Come on, let's take a look. I was happy that we had finally arrived at Doug's beach... ... but there was something about that jetty, I didn't know what. Reaching out into the water, gaunt and ugly at low tide. I hated that jetty the moment I saw it. Road's still there. Just a little washed out. - It's a cinch, Mom. - Doug, what was that pier for? They used to fish here for money. End of the war ended that. They used the jetty for loading. Did you fish off the end of the pier? We sure did, son. Say, if you had a freckle for every barracuda... ...that I caught off the end of that pier... Honey? Well, this is it. Everybody out. Boy, look at all that firewood. I'm vice president in charge of the fire. You promised. Mr. Vice President, lunch in 10 minutes. I'll be back. Dad, Mom, I'm glad we're here. That's for sure. Before we unpack, I'd better move the trailer to a better spot. Okay. Put my shoes in there, will you please, Doug? Know something? I'm glad we're here. That's for sure. Helen, I've looked forward to this all the time I was in the Army. The three of us, out in the middle of nowhere. All this wonderful privacy. Nothing to do but eat, swim, sleep. Nothing to do but eat, swim and sleep. You're like a kid out of school. A kid? Well, we'll talk about that later. I have a feeling I'm going to enjoy it here too. You will. I'm enjoying it more already. "P-E-L-l-G-R-o." - Doug, lunch is ready. - You mean I'm not dreaming? - The iced tea will get warm. - Let it. Well, the sun is hot, we'll get warm. Where's Bobby? Oh, I don't know. Off in a cloud of firewood, I guess. - You better call him. - Later. No, now. Why, you... Go on, call him. We told him lunch in 10 minutes. He must be starving. Okay, you win. See him anyplace? No, but he can't be far. Stop being native and see if you can get him here. Bobby. - Bobby, lunch. - Bobby. That kid. The way he's able to disappear. Doug. Look, out there on the jetty. Bobby. Bobby. Hey, son, come on back. Lunch. Bobby. Bobby, come on back in here. Bobby. Bobby. My foot's stuck, and I can't get it out. Bobby, come on back in here. Bobby, can you hear me? - Bobby... - Doug, what does this mean? "P-E-L-l-G-R-o." Danger. Bobby, are you all right? My foot's stuck, and I can't get it out. Doug, something's happened. He's trying to say something to us. Listen. My foot's stuck, and I can't get it out. I'll go out after him. Bobby, stay right where you are, I'm coming after you. Don't get excited, Bobby. I'll be right there. Take it easy, Bobby. We'll have you back in a minute. There we are. This thing's shaky, Dad. Probably won't hold the two of us. - Don't worry. - You better go back. Don't you worry about that, Bobby. You really got that stuck, haven't you? Relax your foot. Let me see if I can get that shoe off. This might hurt a little bit, son. Just hold it. - There we go. - Gosh, why didn't I think of that? Because you're like your mom, son. You get too excited, that's why. Here, let's put this on. Sit down, get comfortable. We don't want you to pick up any splinters. There we go. See if you can stand on it, boy. Okay? All right, now, take it easy, Bobby. Nice and slow. There we go, fella. You better go across first. These planks might not hold us. - Okay. - Take it easy. Is he all right? Yeah, he's okay. His foot just got stuck. - I'll wait here till you get across, Bobby. - Okay. Attaboy, son. Take it nice and easy. Careful, Bobby. - Doug. - Dad. Dad. Doug, are you all right? Are you hurt? It missed me. That piling, it busted. What's the matter, Doug? Can't you get up? No. - Your foot seems to be caught. - Can't pull it loose. Bobby. Bobby, go up and get the shovel, we'll just dig it a little bit, that's all. - You're sure you're not hurt? - I'm not, that's the strange part of it. I can't figure out why. - The weight of this timber... - I can't feel it. Honey, don't worry about it. We'll dig it out. - Here's the shovel, Dad. - Let me have it, Bobby. Can't I help? I can dig better than Mom. You can take turns, son. - Does it hurt? - No worse than a kick in the shins. - Gosh, it's all my fault too. - How do you figure that? If I hadn't climbed up this blamed old thing, none of this would have happened. Wasn't your fault, Bobby. Doug, this is solid rock. - Here, I'm a good digger. - Yeah. - Let me try. - Yeah, wait a minute, Bobby. I just can't pull it loose. The piling is jammed between those boulders. We could lift it with the car jack. Sure. Why didn't I think of that? - I'll get it, Dad. - Attaboy. There. Right down at the end. That'll be the spot for the jack. I got it, I got it. Got it, Mom. That's it, honey. Just a few more notches. I can move my foot a little. Just a little bit more, baby. The angle pin's broken. It's useless. Bobby, come on. Pull as hard as you can. - Helen. Helen, wait. - Bobby, are you pulling hard? This isn't doing any good. - Get over and push. - You're wearing yourself out. - Doug, we've gotta get you out. - Helen. Stop it. - I'm sorry. - Be quiet, Bobby. Bobby. Bobby, go up to the car and unhook the trailer. Okay, Dad. Helen. Helen, remember when Bobby was two years old... ...and he cut himself on some glass? You saved his life that day. Remember how? By keeping your head. You did get hysterical for a while... ...but I finally convinced you that you had to calm down. One of us had to go for the doctor, while one of us stayed. Worked out fine, remember? Now, let's work along those same lines today. Above all, don't let yourself get hysterical. I won't, I promise. What do you want me to do? First, I want you to know one thing. The two of you alone will never be able to move this timber. - What else can we do? - We could use the car, if we had a rope. - We have, in the trailer. I'll get it. - No. That rope is too light. It'd break. - We've gotta get a heavier rope. - But where? The nearest place is where we stopped for water. - You can get some help. - It's hours away. - Just a few. - And hours back. I'll wait for you. But the roads, you know I'm not a good driver. That's for sure. Sure wish I could drive. - The tide is coming in. - Yeah. Yeah. Won't the tide float the timber off, Dad? It probably will, but you better go for the rope anyway. How much time do I have? It's been coming in for a couple hours. You got four hours. You can make it. Bobby will wait. - What time is it now? - It's almost 4:00. - That perfume, sexish. - Oh, you. By the way, the Mexican word for rope is cuerda. I've got it, Doug. Don't drive fast, and don't take any chances. I won't, dear. - The trailer's unhooked. - Stay here and take care of Dad. I will. Try and stay on the right side of the road. - Comfortable, Dad? - Yeah, sure, Bobby. Get the shovel and the jack up on the beach out of this water. Okay. Bobby, there are lobster boats coming along here all the time. They buy from the native fishermen. When one comes along, maybe we can yell for help, eh? Yeah, when one comes along, I'll get it to stop. Don't worry. - Attaboy. - Want your cigarettes? Yeah, they're up on the table. Bring my lighter too. Okay. Do you speak English? I'm in trouble, I need help. My husband is trapped down by the water. I need a rope. Money. I'll pay you money if you'll come with me. No, no, no, please. Please, come with me. Well, then, tell me where I can get a "cuerdo." Look, Bobby. Let's see if you can guess what this one is, huh? Let's see. - It's a gopher. - Nope. Guess again. Squirrel. A squirrel? Bobby, you're slipping. Everybody knows a squirrel has a big bushy tail. Say, Dad, how long has Mom been gone? Not very long. Come on, you've got one more guess. Gee, Dad, I don't know. I give up. - But what about the lobster boats? - It's a beaver, Bobby. Anybody with eyes in his head can see that. Or maybe you think I'm not a very good artist? Did you really see lobster boats when you were here before? - Sure, lots of them. - Why haven't we seen any? They don't come along till pretty late in the evening. After they've got their catch. - Do you suppose they'll see us? - Sure. Bobby, remember, we weren't gonna worry. Sure, Dad. Well, gee, the water's... And we weren't gonna talk about that either. I'm sorry. Looks like a skunk to me. A skunk. The first thing when we get home, I'm gonna have your eyes examined. Here. - You draw. Let's see how good you are. - I'll skip this turn. Hey, how about me building a fire and making you some coffee? - Would you like some? - Sure, that's a great idea. I'll get some driftwood, and I'll get it going. One cup of coffee coming up. Hello. Hello. You're American. You can help me. I'm in trouble. My husband is trapped back there on the beach. Unless we get back there the tide will drown him. Get in. It's back this way. What time is it? Oh, good. We'll make it. We needed a rope, and I've got one. We were on a fishing trip, and there was this jetty, and my husband, he... You haven't heard a word. - Don't you understand? I'm in trouble. - Aren't we all? Who are you? What were you doing there? I turned, and all of a sudden there you were. Out of the nowhere into the here. Crackers all you got to eat? Well, hello, hello. Don't you understand? I'm in trouble. My husband... Stop, lady. You'll have me crying. - I'm a very sensitive man. - Get out of this car. I need someone who can help. Stop the car and get out. You're a real boss. You must drive your husband nuts. Sure you got nothing more to eat than crackers? You're gonna drive now, and don't try anything. If I have to kill you, no one's gonna know your husband's trapped. No one. And I'll kill you. Honest. Now, move over. Behave now or this gun will blow a very pretty piece of you right over the side. Now, drive. Did you see anyone on the road, hitchhiking, a man? No. What road did you come over? From the beach. My boy is there now. Yes? L... We're on a fishing trip. Don't pick up anyone. There's a dangerous criminal loose down here. Big fellow, an American. If you see anybody, of course you will call the police. Better go to the beach and get your boy back into town. Are they gone? Keep driving a while, you're doing fine. They might come back. Some women would've tried something just then and had their brains blown out. You're smart. Honest. I like smart women. They got cat in them. Now that I didn't give you away, will you take me back? - No. - You've got to. If you don't, he'll drown. When you're mad, the specks in your eyes dance. What kind of a man can let a man die? No one knows he's there. Let's keep it our little secret then. The least you can do is take me back, and then you can go on. Look, you're smart, be smart. I can save your husband or I can save myself. I can't do both. When the dice roll you gotta take what comes. I'll drive now, move over me. Believe me, don't believe me. I'm sorry. You are not. You're right, I'm not. Look at those specks dance now. Here we are, Dad, nice and steaming. Attaboy, Bobby. It sure smells good. - Hope you like it. - Yeah. I like it strong. Well, then, you're gonna like this, it's kind of like ink. How is it? It's very... - Very unusual, Bobby. - Don't you like it? It's the most unusual coffee I've ever tasted. Gee, thanks, Dad. Bobby, I... I was thinking about you while you made the coffee. - What is it, Dad? - L... Well, son, I watched you, and I was pretty proud of you. - Gee, is it that good? - Yeah. What I mean is, you'd never made coffee before, had you? - Nope, and there weren't directions either. - I know. Maybe there are gonna be a lot of times in your life when you have to do things... ...and there won't be directions on how to do them. Things that have to be done. You know what I mean? What are you talking about, Dad? Well, Bobby, like here today. Maybe you'll have to face problems that you never faced before. I want you to tackle them like you did that coffee. Sure, Dad. If your mother's late getting here... - But she won't be, will she? - No, no, but if she is. What I'm trying to tell you is I don't want you to panic and run away. The best thing is to stick around. Your mother is going to expect to find you here when she gets back. Keep that fire going so she'll know where to look for us. Take care of your mother, always, you hear me? Sure. But Mom's not gonna be late, is she? No, no, of course not. But I feel better now knowing that you're gonna be around to take over. Just in case. - I'll go warm it up. - Okay, Bobby. - About the fishing tomorrow, Dad... - Yeah, let's have a contest. - Bet I'll catch the biggest. - Sure you will. You're going to have to go by the road to the beach. - So? - Well, that's where my husband is. Last time I was with another guy's wife... ...she was perfectly happy to forget her husband. Quit worrying. From my angle you got what it takes. You'll find another guy in a breeze. If he dies, I promise you one thing, I'll kill you. That puts you in a class with 10,000 cops. They all got the same idea. - It's a good idea. - Shut up. That hurt, didn't it? I like being alive. I like eating and drinking. I like dice, and I like talking. I like a woman. I like... I don't like cops. You'll splash that beautiful build all over the road. You're built for speed, but not that kind. - You've never been married, have you? - Yeah, once. She had your kind of cat. She was... - Where's the jack? - The beach. We tried to lift the timber off with it. Oh, that's fine. That's fine. - Don't go away. - Where would I go? Yeah, that's right. Pretty neat, huh? Mustn't touch. Trying to kill me, huh? You're wasting an awful lot of energy, honest. You're not going no place. You're just the right weight. Yeah. Put me down. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Bobby, yell. Help! Yell, Bobby. Help! Bobby, go up high. Maybe they can't see you. Run, Bobby, go up high. Run. Get on the platform and keep yelling. Wave the towel, Bobby. Wave the towel. Help! Help! Bobby. Bobby, yell. Help! Help! Over here, we're in trouble. How are the fishing today? Bobby, go up higher. No, wait a minute. Fire. Bobby, build up the fire. Throw something on it, Bobby. No, Bobby. More stuff. That won't burn. Get something from... That's it. Get something from the trailer. Anything that'll burn. Get it down there, Bobby. Throw them on the fire. Hurry, son. Hurry. Help! Help! No, Bobby, that's not... Put everything on it. Grab the tarp out of the trailer. Hurry, boy, run. Hurry. Hurry, Bobby. Throw it right on there. Help! Help! Why didn't they stop? What's turista mean? They think we're tourists, Bobby. Tourists out for an outing. They didn't know we're in trouble. You think maybe the guy will see the smoke? Maybe they've gone for help. Maybe. Bobby. Bobby, you'd better get out of here. - Go up on the beach, dry out your clothes. - I'm okay, Dad. I know, but you're gonna need your strength for when your mother gets here. She might be alone. She'll need help, somebody she can depend on. - Okay, Dad. There'll be other boats along. - Attaboy. Wait until you hear how loud I yell next time. They'll be sure to stop. - One thing I haven't told you. - Don't you know to buy two tires? My boy is back there. One good spare and a cheap retread, just in case. Can't you understand what it'll mean if my husband drowns... ...and the boy has to wait for someone? I knew a guy used to take the nail out of a flat... ...and throw it into the street. - It's deserted. No one knows he's there. Once he fixed seven flats from the same nail. How would you feel if it were your own son? Frankly, I'm not a family man. I've wondered what I would do if it ever came to something like this. I wonder if every wife wonders. Pretty neat, huh? Yeah, pretty neat. Those telegraph wires are gonna be hot... ...when they pull those jerks out of the ditch. But getting away is my business. It's my business to know those police cars travel in pairs. We're gonna hole up for a while. Where do you go from here? We go to La Paz. What are you going to do there? I don't know. One thing at a time. You can't plan too far ahead in this business. - You're amazing. - Yeah, that's what I always tell myself. What are you gonna do about your clothes? You left your coat back there. Those numbers on the back of your shirt... I'll find a guy someplace, and we'll switch. My husband is your size. Honest? There are other things at the beach you could use. For instance? Identification papers which would prove you were Doug Stilwin. They match the registration papers on this car. Now that the other police car has gone by... ...you could spare the time. Hasn't your husband got other clothes than the ones he's got on? No... ...but get him out and they would dry. With his clothes, his identification... ...I could go into the stores for you, to buy food for you. We'd look like an ordinary couple traveling together on a fishing trip. His clothes... ...his identification... ...all on the beach. - That's good perfume you got on you. - Yes. I like cheap perfume. It don't last as long, but it hits harder. Is there anything else your husband's got I could use? I can't think of anything. - I can. - What? His wife. With his clothes, his papers and his wife... ...I could be snug as a bug in a rug. I'd do anything to save my husband. Anything. I only like a woman when she smiles... ...otherwise, what's the kick? How long since you... ...talked with a woman? I could get rough. How long since you talked? Saving your kisses for your husband? Bobby, get up on the beach. Dad, will you take me out on one of those old fishing boats? We could catch some barracuda and some starfish and crabs. Bobby, get up on the beach. Get out. Dad. Dad, someone's coming. I told you. I told you Mom would be back. Son... Hey, Mom. Hey, Mom. It's all right, Doug, I have help now. Out of the water, Bobby, quick. It'll take all the car's got and a lot of luck. We'll try lifting the stuff off of him. Stay with him. I'll go up and tie the rope on the car. Hang on, Doug, hang on. It's going to be all right, darling. Just hold on to me. Get ready. We'll lift with the next big wave. Now. Again. Again. Now. It didn't move. Give it more. I'll try again. It's no good. I'm getting out of here. What's the matter? Won't it work? It won't work, the car won't pull. You're a cat all right, but what do you expect me to do? There's gotta be another way. You never give up, do you? Untie that rope. Take hold of that. That's right. All right, now throw up the rope. Shove the end under the piling like a crowbar. Like you're prying off the lid of a can. Are there some rocks under there you can grab hold of? Yes. You got it? I've got it. Have you got it wedged under those rocks so it'll lift? I think so. Good. Now, it won't lift the stuff far, and we gotta work fast. Get ready to yank him out. It's all right, darling. We'll get you out. Now. It moved. Give it more. I'll try again. You'll be all right now, darling. Stay with him, Bobby. I'll get the blankets. His clothes I got. How about you? I'll hate you every minute of the time. But I said I'd go with you, and I will. - You mean it. - Yes. I thought I had a woman figured from every angle. I thought you'd come begging. You're sure with that husband of yours? He's a lucky guy. A little of that kind of luck I could've used myself. Better wrap some more blankets around him. Goodbye. Get back to town. There's a dangerous criminal loose. He was a swell guy. He killed... ... and he deserves to be killed. And yet... ... how will we feel when we read in the papers that he's been trapped... ... shot down? Yes. Yes, I've wondered what I would do if it ever came to something like this. I wonder if every wife wonders. [ENGLISH]
