Who prays for Satan? The original sinner. I can't move. Why can't I move? Please, talk to me. Somebody get us out of here... Shut up! Help! Please, help. Please. Aah. Hmm. Hmm. You should try this. Don't hurt me. - You have to try it. - Yeah. What's your name? Elise. Elise. You're gonna rape and murder me, aren't you? I don't sell damaged goods. I used to raise plants. Can you guess what kind? Hmm? Venus fly traps. I was a different kind of... farmer, back then. You gotta watch when they flower. Flowers drain energy. They weaken the plant. You have to nip the flower as soon as they start to grow. If you don't stop the growing, you run the risk of weakening the rest of the plant. Hey. Hey! You don't have to worry about them. You're not going where they're going. You're going to a much better place. Where? To the farm. Believe me. It's a much better place than where they're going. - Follow the yellow line. - Do not deviate. Follow the yellow line. Do not deviate. Follow the yellow line. Do not deviate. They will fall to the last up there. Follow the yellow line. We will fall and rise. Time to die. Here. Here. Listen to me. My gun. This is our end game. We had to play this through, Agent Boon. The whole time. You want me alive. - Follow the yellow line. - Do not deviate. Follow the yellow line. Do not deviate. You had me wondering right up until you fired the shot, Agent Boon. - Follow the yellow line. - Do not deviate. I healed nicely, don't you think? Follow the yellow line. Do not deviate. There's no woman here to warm your bed, Sieg. Follow the yellow line. Do not deviate. I will fuck you in hell. Follow the yellow line. Do not deviate. Should you wish to terminate before processing. Agent Boon. Welcome to Death House. It's good to see you again, Captain Galan. Victor. You earned the right to call me that. Some place. Does it live up to what you studied? Ask me again in 12 hours. Dr. Fletcher, meet Agent Boon. Agent Boon. Dr. Fletcher, ma'am, I don't know whether to shake your hand or to kneel... Knock knock. Agent Novak. Good to see you again. Likewise, sir. Hi. Dr. Fletcher. Agent Novak. No, Dr. Redmane? Oh, you'll meet. Right now, meet your fellow graduate, Agent Toria Boon. You should have a lot in common. Your Honors request, is first order. What is this? Your Honors request. Containment shield lowered. Jesus Christ. Mom. You son of a bitch! Ah! Free them. Who is she? Alma Lin Kinny. The press named her, "Leatherlace." She killed and skinned her victims with the help of her lover, whom she eventually killed. The video footage is hers. They found hundreds of hours in her apartment after her arrest. Am I seeing your and Dr. Redmane's tabula rasa research? Part of it. God, I don't want to go! Ugh! She's been listening to that audio feed for the last 200 days. No! I can't do it. I can't. We then used our classified compound to ensure total mind erasure. Some people here call it, milk of amnesia. The hologram footage on her tube is her father. It's part of her mental reformat. As she feared him. It's like Clockwork Orange.Mmm-hmm. We can reprogram all new memories, erase them and put new ones in. Textbook case, really. Yeah. Our goal is to eradicate evil. And at long last, Dr. Karen Redmane. Hello. Doctor, Agent Boon. Great to meet you. Wow, I've read your work for years. There'll be a quiz following the tour. Yeah? I trust Dr. Fletcher has been helpful and charming. They're all paralyzed with curare, and fed a steady drip of barbiturates through one arm and amphetamine and LSD through the other. The mix creates a brain flush. But, much like panning for gold, yields nuggets of truth. So, you do the scrubbing, and you do the actual laundry. Girl power. Some are dosed with just LSD, while others are subjected to electroshock, sensory deprivation... all to break down the subject's personality, which can then be replaced... Transhumanism. Mental illness is contagious. Sick people spread sickness by art, writing, words. There is no coincidence in the rise of social media and the rise of social violence. I rest my case. Like the old backmasking. You know, hand the devil by playing a record backwards, kind of shit. That was proven in the Nazi era, And the Jim Jones halt in Guyana.Ah... Which was preempted by congressman Ryan's inspection. Well, we're not fans of congressional oversight here. I see. What a nice sig to our next stop. You'll all be meeting again. Until then. I look forward to it. Yeah. Yeah, we'll talk more. Yes. Yes, Dr. Fletcher, I'm on my way. This is your virtual tour, take it at your own pace. I will be available for questions. K.O Complex East, Death House. Begin virtual tour. The Death House, established in 1954, under the Eisenhower administration, was created in the wake of operation paperclip. This facility serves as a federal maximum security prison, Medical, psychological and para psychological research center. There are nine levels. With the first dedicated to prisoner intake and minimum security confinement. The ninth and final level is reserved for the five evils. One mile into the earth. Prisoners are confined to virtual environments that recreate environments before confinement, to preserve their natural surroundings for study. Each containment cell is fed a chronic gas mixture, to keep the prisoners amenable to the virtual illusions around them. Agent Jae Tinyn Novak, 32 years of age. Honors request granted. Final advancement scenario: 108-19-83. Agent Toria Lex Boon, 32 years of age. Honors request granted. Final advancement scenario: 0917-1967. Now you both know why you made it this far. The ninth level is reserved entirely for the five evils, and is also the most heavily secured. Hirace Giger, former Nazi-head of Adolf Hitler's resurrection program. Captured June 13th, 1945. Extradited to the United States to avoid Soviet acquirement. Actual age: unknown. Number of victims: undetermined. Balthoria. Full birth name: Unknown. Date of intake: December 17, 1966. Age: Undetermined. Number of victims: Undetermined. Hemophile. Alexi Nela. Age: Undetermined. Deported to United States in 1994 under U.S.-Russian Psy exchange. Cannibal, necromancer. Connected to deaths of over 700 children. 700 kids? Crau. Age: Unknown. Bioweapon, U.S. origin. Apprehended South America, October 8, 1983. Victim count: Unverifiable. Intelligence: Incalculable. Thile. Age: Unknown. Expertise in satanic arts. Known for crucifixion and for turning victims inside out. Number of victims: Unknown. Predominant number of victims: Female. Apprehended: 1984. Even in this sunlight, I can see your eyes boy. Come a little closer. Have a look. You can see me? You were in my cell because of technology. This is a great time to be alive, innit boy? So... So, the real question here is, why are they showing you me? You like this? You like to see it like this? To get your gun hard? Or maybe it's the guy that does it for you. Maybe both. What the fuck is this? They blamed your kid brother for this. Sent him to camp, right? When I heard you were coming here, I asked for this moment. Confession if you will. Do you pray, boy? I'm not really sure why I do. Maybe more for them than me. I don't even know if there's a soul. I know there's gotta be something. Something more... Just don't know what. You've got your blood and tissue, and all that goes away. But, I think, perhaps, there is something more. Yeah. Perhaps there is. They've got some surprises waiting for you and your girl, here. They were video glitches. We've been having technical difficulties. Those people... victims, in those cells, who are they? You know, I think we've covered enough for the first session. Why don't you two take a break? Yeah, I pretty much live here. I mean, I did 73 hours last week. By the way, did you guys fix that power issue inside or what? Mitchell... are you guys seeing this? Looks like we have a bloody rag here on the barbwire. I think we have skunks in the dumpster again. Central... Central, come in. Jesus Christ. Yeah! So... They let you kill the guy who killed your mother, huh? It was my Honors request. I took the lives of two innocent people. I earned it. Okay. What was your Honors request for slitting those throats? Let me ask you something. Do you ever get deja vu coming in here? We're the best of the best of our class. Do you really believe that? I think you do. Yeah. What do your birds mean? I drew 'em. 11 birds... but I can't remember. And the girl? Same thing. But I don't know why. I'm the same way. I don't know. It's odd... I don't remember where... how I got them... why? Marigold... the name... It means something. I can see it in my dreams, but... I don't know what it is. Do you remember anybody from my class? Like fuckin' facebook friends? Like, any of that kind of shit? You're askin' me if I'm single? I wouldn't care if you weren't. My point is. I don't remember anyone. Not one person. Well, like you said, "We're the best of the best." Holy Christ. What the hell happened? What the... K.O complex, East, Death House. Begin virtual tour. I love being an avatar. One of the perks of the job. He will be conditioned. Mind erased. Reformatted with proper morals, compassion, and obedience for the law. You will become transhuman. Better than human, once the physical conditioning is completed, or as you put it, "The laundry." What's the difference between transhumanism and brainwashing? Well, it's a different process entirely. And we don't have an agenda. We instill morality. Morality? Principles concerning the distinction between good or bad and, right and wrong. Whose morality? I mean, I slit some fucker's throat. Am I a candidate for transhumanism? Well, what about me? I killed a man for revenge. I executed a mother and her son in the line of duty. The agent, who brought Sieg to us, she did the good thing. Don't let these experiments confuse you, or make you feel otherwise. We're excising a moral cancer. Did Sieg ever mention Death House to you? Ever any talk of the five evils? How do we even know if any of this is real? What if this is all one giant VR program? Dr. Redmane will show you wardrobe to start the tour. I'll meet you after. Bennett, good afternoon. Ah, hey! Welcome to central casting. This is special Agents Boon and Novak. Nice to meet you, Boon and Novak. Let me introduce you to my partners in crime. Please, doctors join us. Dr. Angela Freeman, Dr. Logan Harrison. Hi, nice to meet you. We would love a behind the scenes tour. Ah! A little movie magic. Right this way. I like to equate all this to... Excuse me. Looking down on an ant hill, okay? It looks like chaos. Quite frankly, sometimes it feels like chaos. But each ant has its own job, and knows exactly what to do. Everything is recreated down to the final detail. We choose our subjects according to facial structure, body weight, eye color, even scent. What kind of scents? Hair, cosmetic, body odor, feminine odor... Whatever can trigger the behavior of the prisoners. Each intake is selected for their resemblance to a victim profile. As Dr. Logan indicated, we dress them, we style their hair. Sometimes, we even fix prosthetics to trigger the proper responses. Check this out. Every single person in this room has taken a shot of milk of amnesia. What we have here is very unique. We have the ability to tailor our victims right to the prisoner profiles, and get full accessibility to their personality profiles, as well as brainwave mapping. Our inmates are studied on an almost cellular level. The information is compiled into what will be the greatest criminal database ever created. Let me show you. We have breast size, body type. We fit the victim to the prisoner. And as you can see the results are very impressive. Look, I know how this seems, but this really is a service. Okay? All these people out there... they would have died anyway. At least here, they get their 15 minutes. Assuming they live that long. Now, all jokes aside, I'm genuinely proud of this staff of make-up artists and designers. We should win a few Oscars in all seriousness. Do you realize, our set decorators work with computer programmed designers, to recreate everything down to the finest detail? We have a "night stand girl." That's right. One girl, one job, dress night stands. She gets the perfect picture, the perfect lamps, the perfect tissue boxes. Also, the setting looks as close to perfect as we can get. It was spot on. What about the ones who aren't cast? Not my department. What happens to them? Well, they're routed to other areas and used for other purposes. Nothing gets wasted here. Yeah, not everyone brought in here is a victim. I mean, others are studied in... different ways. Anyway, before I bring you back to Dr. Fletcher, there's three very interesting guys I'd like you to meet. They're kind of my pet projects. Dr. Bennett, thank you so much. This was wonderful. No, you're wonderful. Thank you. Erm. The, umm, homeless woman that was selected for your Honor killing was done so because of her resemblance to your mother. She fits Cal Ness's profile. Right.Yeah. All right, let's go. Novak! Don't cut the shirt. That's the only thing holding him together. These are the three Satans. We found three prisoners who hold delusions. That one is Satan, one created Satan, and one is the son of Satan. What are the chances of that? Pretty good, actually. You might be right. In any case, I borrowed a C.I.A. playbook from the '60s, wondering if these three held together, would somehow cancel each other out and cure their delusions. And? They're still batshit crazy... for now. Hey, you wanna meet them? Yeah. It's perfectly safe and so entertaining. Come on, I love these guys. Princes of darkness... I brought you some visitors. These are special Agents, Boon and Novak. They're undergoing final training, and they wanted to meet you. I am Satan. My straight name is Arthur Channing Brai. I created Satan. I have other names, but they like this one. I am Satan. AKA Michael Devon. You might recall that Mr. Devon renovated an entire three storey home in Iowa, into a torture chamber. He's not Satan. Satan, 2.0 then? This handsome devil is Tyler Campian. The true son of Satan. Tyler had a promising career as an illusionist and escape artist. Another David Blaine or Houdini. That all ended when he gutted... his mother, his sister, and his grandfather. And stuffed them full of rosary beads, before crucifying them on a church yard. He then went on to kill a nursery of infants of a hospital, in a search for the "Christ child." No one knows how he avoided detection. You took my mask. Mmm-hmm. He's talking about his mask he used when he was a performer. And I'm going to keep it too, until you drop this one. If you're Satan, why don't you make those restraints disappear? Much too vulgar a display of power. Well played, I like that. I know who I am. I am Satan. The AntiChrist. The beast. And if I wasn't, I wouldn't lay claim to anything of the sort. I know this house is insane. And I know that you have to be careful. Oh, Mr. Devon, please. Your rash generalization that everyone in an insane asylum is necessarily insane, is highly insulting. There are people here who are not insane. Those two aren't. Each person is a temple. Please respect that. It's not what you take with you, it's what you leave behind. Excuse me? Hell... isn't a word, it's a sentence. She has to understand what's going on in here... I am Satan! The beast! And the Creator! If that's true, why do you think I brought you all here together? Electronic voodoo? Brainwashing? You really should be more inquisitive as to why these two were brought here. You think they're on your side. Isn't the devil a master of lies? You fucking bitch! You took my mask! You... You fu... Solitary! Going down. Ninth level. There are some specific personalities dangerous to a healthy society. The passive individual, the one who's afraid to say what they think. They stand for everything and they stand for nothing. Like the bureaucrats behind the holocaust. They personified the banality of evil that exterminated millions. There is a possessive type. Filled with jealousy, demanding loyalty. This type, poses a direct threat to children. We're getting an electronic signal inside of him. The insecure ones, mediocrity is their standard. Afraid to live, scared to die, they lived by the dictates of society. And they're dangerous for their need and lust to have authority over them. What did they do? Did they shove his radio up his ass? The last type is a psychopath. This type is the most dangerous during times of social and political upheaval. I think I've got whatever it is. Here it comes. Here it comes! Here it comes! 60 minutes auxiliary power. Containment cell breach. Red alert. 60 minutes auxiliary power. Containment cell breach. Red alert. 60 minutes auxiliary power. No, main line is all we got. Fuck no! We expect EMP's from outside. We're on batteries. Facility-wide power outage. How do you know that? When that light comes on, we're in total blackout. A power failure? A place like this can have a fucking power failure? We were shut down. By whom? I think we stopped below level four. Are your phones working? Nope. - Containment cell breach. - Red alert. We need to get this piece of shit back into storage. How do we detach him from this shit? Containment cell breach. Red alert. Can't that kill him? Containment cell breach. Red alert. Vacate premises. You guys didn't plan on anything like this happening? Agent Novak, in 1997, the military built a stealth bomber for two billion that couldn't fly in the rain. This facility was a record 3.2 billion and cost 5 million a year to maintain, so, yes, we have a few flaws. This place has to be like NORAD. So far down that an external EMP hit wouldn't do anything. Shield it. Well, apparently, no one thought of an interior attack. What's the exit strategy? Well, we have an hour of battery with generator backup, but we're not moving and I don't hear the generators, so... Why isn't the elevator on backup? In a situation like this, all the focus is on containment. If we lose all the power, the shields go down, the gas stops and everyone comes out of their fog. Well, then, there should be a kill switch. I mean, you've got gas flowing everywhere. Don't you have something special lined up to kill everybody inside this fucking hellhole, in case there's a doomsday scenario? We have one. But we're pretty insulated in here for right now. They'll be looking for an escape, not for us. The ones below are going to decide that this shaft is a shortcut to the top. What about the five evils? When we get power back on, we'll get you to a medic, and get those taken out. Are you just going to stand there? Help me. Jesus Christ, is that below us? A design flaw got us in here, there's gotta be one to get us out, if not, we get to the kill switch. We have a two man rule to prevent any single person from activating the death gas. If power isn't restored within the hour, the commanding officer will order two officers to activate the gas. The ninth level is different. The gas doesn't reach that far? It reaches... it won't work. Facility sealed. Facility sealed. Facility sealed. Fucking die! Containment force shield breach imminent. All staff vacate premises. Containment for shield breach imminent. All staff vacate premises. Shock one... Tango. Where the hell is the gas? That's it. Here we go people. Can't see them. Where the fuck are they? Deploy shields. Yeah, yeah! They're out. Listen. Listen to me. So, would anybody else like to try? Huh? Anyone? I didn't think so. We all know what lies at the bottom of this place. We all know "they" are down there. The way out is not that way. It's down, to them with me. I'm new here. Fresh fish. Isn't there a rule about taking on the biggest guy in the prison to send a message? I will follow you to hell. Just the place I'm going. Come with me if you want to live. Do you ever take your job seriously? Oh, come on, I gotta lighten the mood a little bit. Dr. Fletcher... Great. Pull. Pull. Thank you. Well... Only two lights here. That, and them. Oh, and this. You better know your way around this place. What am I looking for? Doors. Thanks. I highly doubt we're going to be better off on any floor. If they see him, we're done. Whoo-hoo! Here's Johnny! Don't worry, we're going to have fun right now. Come here, little guy. Damn it, you smell good. What is that lavender? Goddamn, you smell... Up kitty! So cute when you're mad. Oh, yeah. Well, the harder you fight me, the harder I get. My turn, bitch. Whoo! I'm tellin' you, I think I'm in love. I know you felt it too. You special. I'm not sharing you with nobody. I don't care how many secrets I get. Don't go looking in my room, with my own comfort. You ain't going nowhere, bitch. Come on! You fuckin' want it? You want it, too? You'll get it motherfucker! I'm going take these fucking pants off. I'm gonna fuck you so hard. - Oh, God. - Check these bodies. Flashlights, guns... You think the batteries will work. They should. I can't see anything. Oh, my God. Shit! Oh, my God! AGENT NOVAK: How many inmates are on this level? 39 after him. But maybe less. It's so hard to tell. But there're labs we can use for shelter. Shelter? We gotta find a way up... AGENT BOON: Shh! We forgot to close the elevator shaft. Fucking run! Go! Run! You want penetration? Move! Listen to me. Listen. AGENT BOON: Oh, God! Clear. We gotta stop.DR. FLETCHER: Go on. Okay, the stairs go to more cells. This way leads to the experimental chambers. What's the difference? DR. Less run-ins. AGENT BOON: Where are the guards? Alive or dead? AGENT NOVAK: They fuckin' ate 'em. They're going to BE on us soon. You know something? I know everything, Novak. Get it together. Christ. Come down and eat with us. Let's go. Move it! Move it! Go! What the fuck? Where? There. Okay, we're going in. We have no choice. Novak, get the door! Keep the lights low. Stay by this door. I know this cell. We no longer wish to be here. Are we alone? Don't come closer, or I'll take you out of here. There should be nine of them. Nine of what? Prisoners and homeless. We have yet to explain what happened in here. Fuck that. Novak! We no longer wish to be freed. How are they still alive? We don't know. We stay in here until they've lost interest out there. Redmane! Stop. Wait here. So many things I want to do to you. There's no time. Like rape and kill me? Very original. You really are a legend in your own mind, Doctor. Is this the third one? REDMANE: Yeah. He's the one you want. Get up. Here's his mask. Hmm. We no longer wish to be freed. We can't just sit here. We need to get out of here. Clear the door. Clear. You sure you can do this? You've earned your mask. Homeless, kept in storage. What does this have to do with the kill switch? The kill switch is a gas that disables the immune systems, allowing your own body's bacteria to eat you alive which results in this. No human remains. Why does this only happen to some of them? If we can target one, We can target the whole facility. Even through intake? Whoo! All in the name of science. How are we going to get them up there? No power. Hook 'em anyway. We'll string 'em by hand. No drugs for you. You get the full experience. There. We got us a lab coat. What about the others? Fuck 'em. We got somewhere to be. Freedom. Freedom! She's coming. She's gone. We gotta see. I think they're going down in them. Dr. Fletcher? Dr. Fletcher... The kill switch? DR. Ask them. AGENT BOON: Ask who? No, no! Come on, get up. They're opening the side doors. Only way up is down. Is this your plan? Free fall, drop to the bottom? Drop and shoot. Is that the best you got? Get your hand wrapped up. Hey... It's okay. It's bad. Oh, shit. Fuck it, I'm fine. I'm fine. All right. What do we do when we get to them? I don't think they're capable of mercy. There they are. They're right there. Let's go. I am God, the great and terrible. Stay with me. We're almost there. Not that easy. You've come for us. We have always been with you. What do you want? We want to get the fuck out of here. Figured you were our best bet. Why didn't you just pray? Do not pray to us. Do you believe that we give you a better chance at being saved than God? You shot yourself. You freed me. God is a supreme sadist. Evil is God's lie to maintain slavish obedience and conformity. We are the messengers of freedom from a vain, selfish, irrational God. You have no idea, the atrocities you committed. Only they would wipe them with their programs. They trained you. They made you into their slaves. We are here to free you. You are here to free us. I never saw you. But you have. They selected the memories that you carry. We let you see through the fog. You're part of a brave new world now. There is no evil. Evil faces extinction. Well, what about him? We just gave him what he asked for. He wanted you to know. Read... Tell us what you see. Take me. I will see you soon. What you see in this facility is not contained here. There are other Death Houses. They threaten both good and evil. How? Technology is the new God. Software is the new dogma. Their using it to try and create a race. It is neither good nor evil. It will just be. The world needs us. We need to be freed into it. You need to pursue us. Every killer secretly wants to be caught. Without us, there is no evil. Without evil there is no good. True hell is nothingness. Stay. We were imprisoned here, because we are a threat to the likes of Dr. Fletcher. People who think that humans can be transcended above their flaws, above good and evil. The universe was not designed for that. My crimes have never been deemed acceptable. Yet, what you saw out there, children being used and abused for the sake of progress that transcends evil, disguised as good. Sieg. You know my name. I followed all of you. I've connected with what has made you immortal. I've had communion with the power... I've studied. You followed! Yes, everything. Now, I'm one of you. You hear that? I brought them here. They followed me here, knowing how long you've been imprisoned. You were always a part of our plan. What plan? Our escape plan. I am your servant. I've learnt so much. We know you. We studied you while we slept. You disgust us. Listen. Listen to me! I am immortal. Really? See? A clean slate... free from original sin. Welcome to the world, boy. VOICE OVER P.A Facility back online. Novak? What now? We go find him. Bring him back. We reboot the game. We don't even know what we are. Who we are... Let's go find out. Work to do. What's your name, sweety? My name is Linz.Linz. Well, Linz, welcome to the farm. Hey, Hana, I got the stuff. Oh, shit. I got the wrong box. All I got was this mask. Can you use this?
