WRITTEN AND PRODUCED BY LAURENT CHOUCHAN OUT OF THE BLUES THE WORLD OF MUSIC PARIS PHILARMONIC: TOM BLEDISH -It's green, sir. -Yes. Dear Adrienne we have your test results: you're among the four pre-selected French candidates for the European space mission. Tom, I just heard back from ESA. I'm in! Kisses, I love you. No, turn if off. You scared me! I was calling you... Turn it off... -What's wrong? -Off! What's wrong? Please turn it off, turn it off! What's going on? What happened? Nothing. -Are you sick? -No. What's wrong? Are you sure he is up to the task? I'm positive. He's young, has a lot to give to the Paris Philharmonic. I hope so. Madam Secretary, Tom will convince you. I've known him for 23 years, and he still has so much to give! Ferraro is cheaper. If I were in it for the money, I wouldn't have insisted. Ferrero left me because I stood up for Tom. Excuse me... Hello... He what? He cried at a red light. I'm not sure I get it, sweetie... Well, the... It turned to orange... Yes? And then to red... And? Then green again... And then...? Then orange... Then red, it's a traffic light. But what upset you so? I don't know... It did upset me. What did? That's what I don't understand. Well, it changed colors. A traffic light changing colors... That made you cry? Hi, it's Piotr. Sorry to bother you, I can't reach Tom. Do you know where he is? -Here. -Can I talk to him? He can't talk now. -Why? -I don't know. What do you mean? I'm at the Ministry, I just signed his contracts. A cop says he cried at a traffic light. Tell them it's a conjunctivitis, and call me back. Very well. Take care. So? He has a conjunctivitis. DR. GOËBORG GENERAL PRACTITIONER I can't get rid of negative ideas. True. I can't do anything. True. I find myself disappointing. Yes, true. I have no future. Also true. QD2/PICHOT QUESTIONNAIRE 13/13. At least the diagnosis is clear: depression. How come? I have it all! A wife and a job I love, the critics worship me, and I'm rich... There are tissues there... Why depression? It's the best time ever! Yes, but think of baby blues: why would a woman who just had a cute baby be depressed? -I don't know. -Me either. But therapy is available to help you. In three weeks you'll be fine. Three weeks? What will I tell the orchestra? The truth. I'll tell them I'm depressed. You're right, everyone will feel much better. Depression is just another disease. It's not shameful. This should be most clear. It's essential to your recovery. Okay? Okay. This is just so beautiful... You're not going. I am. Not everyone will. You're on your own, don't talk to me. Sorry I'm late, I fell. I'm sorry, I'm having problems, I'll be unavailable for three weeks. Three weeks? At most. Is this psychosomatic? No! But I need to face the music. The music, really? I'm off... Are you going to pay back your days off, or are you going to get paid? The manager scrimps on everything for us! I'll pay back all my days off... What? This is going to ruin us! But they were like a pack of wolves! You did the right thing! They admire you more now. I was facing 120 musicians! It's like a tamer with his lions. If he's not on top they'll eat him alive. You're ok. I suffer from depression! No drama please. You saw a doctor, a good one, in three weeks it's all over. It's just another disease! No. Cancer's a disease. Depression is... ludicrous! It's not! It is. Well, I was right. We'll have to cancel concerts. We're insured. It's very bad news. Do you know what depression is? It's just 3 weeks. Come on, my uncle's depression lasted 5 years. He hanged himself in his shrink's waiting room! A depression? -Really? -Yes. Fuck... The elections are coming up. How could I let an ambitious asshole like you influence me? In three weeks, he's on the podium, conducting, or you can kiss your budding political career goodbye! -For sure. -For sure. It's going to be okay. Look at him, isn't it sad... Take someone with depression to the beach, and he'll always be alone with himself. Stop being so negative. We took my uncle everywhere too. We thought he'd forget his worries, and it never did. Please stop. Adrienne? Anna! What a nice surprise! What are you doing here? I'm on holiday. Is that Tom? What's he doing? He's concentrating... On what? You know, visualizing scores... How are you? I got fired from the ESA. Why? My mum got Alzheimer's. I understand, you know? Not for long. Tell these kids to play elsewhere. They interrupted him, aren't they stupid. Excuse me. Sorry about that. It's ok... Tom, be kind! They're just kids! They're being annoying! -Took the meds? -Yes! Let's go sail. Stop bugging me! Tom do this, Tom be kind! And I hate the waves' sound! If anything is stressing you out, they ditch you. It's a no-brainer. It's over for me. What did he say? His doctor says it would make him more anxious. I can only hope he gets better soon. Poor you! His doctor said he... Hi there. Well, well! What a nap! I can't help it. It wasn't a rebuke... No! We're exhausted too because of the jet-lag! Exhausted! You seem to be doing better. See, you got up fine. -What can I get you? -Nothing. Come on, have a drink. A caipirinha, please. Sure. The weather's so nice! Too bad you missed the sunset, it was beautiful. I miss everything. That's not true! The sun sets every day, we'll see it again. Look... -She dances great. -Yes. Ask these retards to stop. Thank you, thanks. Shit, was that a surprise? I'm sorry. It was a bad idea. It was a great idea. It was ridiculous. No, no... Take it easy, it's no big deal! It's funny! They are terrible. What an idiot! -Where are you going? -To bed. You just got up! When we get back, he'll be doing great. Give me that. Enough! Is he doing better? Yes he is! He can't conduct but he is. I can't believe it! It's the price to pay! The greatest went through the same thing. Beethoven, Mozart, Mahler, Bach! -Not Bach. -Really? -Ivy League boy. -So? Anyhow we don't have a choice. We can't stop now. It may be a disaster. Send him to see this guy. ASAP. -Move! -Yes, I'm moving! Get Bledish an appointment with this guy. Did Bach have depression? -Which one? -What? Johann-Sebastian, Wilhelm... Find out for all! There must be one who did! Do you feel guilty about Ferrero? Yes. Well, I don't know. I owe him a lot... But should I have left him my place? To should him how thankful I am? Can we stop? My head hurts. Do you have the prescription? Sorry, it's a bit crumpled because I like doing it. I'd like this to stop please. I hate criticizing colleagues, but it's retarded to think it's all chemistry. Get off the meds now. It will take long, it will be painful, but it's the way to go, -Do you trust me? -Yes. Good. Here's the awful result we owe to a hardcore psychoanalyst who thinks you stop tsunamis from a couch. What happened? What's wrong? You're late. -I'm his wife! -You're late. But what happened? Stuporous melancholia. The patient's motionless, speechless, has no motivation, is oblivious, stiff with pain. His moaning expresses his moral pain, the motionlessness. The motionlessness... I can only talk about one thing: Me! Horrible me! Why does he loathe himself so? The self is at the center. In depression, you hate who you are, were, will be. You can't enjoy yourself. Do you still have sex? Lately, I only use my penis to pee! It's normal. Depression targets your vital energy. So you feel even worse. You can only love others if you love yourself! Ever tried loving a piece of shit? Your wife does. So do your manager and your fans. Why couldn't you? Because I'm shit! I didn't even give her a family! He's nuts. I don't want kids right now. So it's not as bad as you say. There's so much misery, and yet I complain. I'm just a lousy conductor! And a domestic tyrant. Enough of this. I'll do what I want. Do you have his prescriptions? I won't criticize a colleague, but really... It's not either meds or an analysis. The meds allow you to resurface, then you can move on to psychotherapy. There's always hope. Soon, the loser you think you are will laugh about what you told me today. -Thanks. -Thanks. How much is it? He won't hear about money. 125 euros. It's better to avoid leaving him alone. -Why? -He needs people. Hire live-in nurses. A reliable friend is even better. Guess who, buddy! -Recognize old Stan? -I do. I've been dying to spend some time with you! Since our weekend at Manuel's! We're going to have even more fun! I brought games, the backgammon, card games, I rule, 17 hilarious DVD's, some porn... Really? Come on. This is going to be fun. I'll get some beer. No, he's on meds. Okay. Let's have Cokes and fast food. Some girls may come over. Stop being so perky, I can't stand it. Tom, don't be rude to Stan, you like him so! Don't go. I'm a pilot. It's my job. Your passion is music, mine's flying. Please. Don't leave me alone with him. Tom... Go then. Bitch. I'm sorry. Sorry. I love you so much. Love you too. -I'm driving you nuts. -No. I'm back on Monday. You're happy to always be leaving. It gives you a break. Tom, I must go. Wait a minute, the plane won't leave without you. Tell me something nice. Don't worry. I'm going to kill myself. This is blackmail! No it's not. It's really exhausting, you know. That's what I'm saying, it gives you a break. Well, I'm off? Deal with the consequences. Adrienne! Can I handle this? Yes, don't worry. He always makes me feel bad, then calms down. Here are all the numbers just in case. He sleeps 20 hours a day. He just needs to be with someone. Really, Stan, you're sweet. It's no big deal. -You'll be careful? -No worries. I'm sorry. I'm ashamed. That's nuts. What? I meant "You're a doofus" or something. You're abusing me. No! I suffer tremendously. Now you come here and abuse me! It's an expression! Asshole. Want to relive our last weekend? Yes, why? Adrienne! -How are you? -Okay. And Tom? He's okay. -Depression, huh? -Says who? I owe 30% of Deutsche Grammophon. I monitor my investment. And I'm interested in you. At times he's better. -The ESA know? -No. I won't tell them. And what are you up to? Since you left me? Nothing exciting. I miss you. You'll get over it. How long are you staying? Till Sunday. I'll be in Paris next week, let's get together. With Tom? That'd be fun! They're waiting. I'll call you. Hello. He's exhausted, what can I say. I no longer work with Ferrero. Hello? He doesn't compare to Tom! But he's sane! We should've stuck with him! We? We should have nothing! I am the boss! You know nothing about music! I know numbers. Set up a business! Let me handle my agency! Sorry. I'm upset. Blame yourself. Enough. I know Tom, he'll pull through. We should have stuck with Carlo. We? We are not a manager! Hello? You can fuck Ferrero! Yes, Madam Secretary. He's out. Should he call you back later? Sure... She says you're digging your own grave. Oh fuck. A sweet little song my mum used to sing for me I'd listen as I fell asleep, sucking my thumb... I want to sing you this sweet tune for you skin is soft as the moss in the woods... -Is he okay? -What about me? -You okay? -No! He's been abusing me! He blackmailed me! I haven't slept at all! I called his doctor to change the meds! It didn't work! I'm sorry. "He sleeps 20 hours a day!" Bitch! He even tried to hit me! Oh, there you are. I'm thirsty. What's wrong? It's the lithium. The funny thing is every case is unique! We're going to try Turquamil... Your mood is getting better? I've cried my eyes out. On 6 pills a day? Let's try Zetex. You'll get through. This way out... Call me if anything's wrong. Thank you. I'm sorry. Hello? Yes, it can do that. I'll send you a different prescription. Tom? Occupied. I need to go run an errand. Could you get some toilet paper? Yes. -And some talcum. -Yes. Adrienne? Yes, sweetie. Oh, do call me sweetie! Fred! Asshole. You can call me names. He's ruining your career. So? What should I do? Work for me. No one will care about your husband's moods. We can kill him, too. The space widow! Why this offer? You're on the ESA's short list, among the best. So? I need to think. Not too long. Thanks, Fred. I also wanted to tell you I'm nice, see - I know someone great for Tom. I don't want to hurt your feelings. Since he got sick, everyone seems to know someone great. It's up to you. -Bertrand Lavoisière. -The Nobel Prize winner? How do you know him? 1/5 Frenchmen will suffer from depression their lives: I invested in drug firms. He works for one and we've become friends. Et il se trouve que je parraine son I sponsor his charity. But if you're not interested... I am interested. Consider it done. I'm doing this for me, not him. As long as he's sick, I know you won't leave him. Tom? I'm in the bathroom. How was it? I may join his mission. -You fucked? -Are you crazy? He used to fuck you. I don't want him to. Someone has to fuck you. I'll wait for you to get better. And I have some good news: I got you an appointment with Lavoisière. Nobel prize Lavoisière? He's friends with Fred. And you didn't fuck? No! Stop being dirty! Sucked his dick to thank him? Fuck you. I won't go. I won't owe him a thing. You have his prescriptions? Let's start from scratch. Found me a depressed Bach yet? Do it yourself! You're rude, I'm not your dog! Philippe Barrois's office, hello. Right away. Piotr Ladislav. How is he? A miracle! He'll start rehearsing next week. I apologize. Tom was driving me crazy, but he's been rebooted. Forget about Bach. I'll tell Catherine the news. It's good to feel alive again! My brain and my body are working again. Thanks for everything. I owe you one. I love you. I made you go through hell. You were annoying. To say the least. Anyhow! You're the one who suffered. What matters now is music. I agree. Sorry... I'd like an autograph. Sure! Every year, we travel to hear you conduct. We went to Chicago to hear you in Verdi's Requiem. Thanks. It was like my own requiem, really... You're still nervous. No way! Hello? Fred. I hear Tom's better. He's alive again. It's Fred. Good! Leave him now. That's unlikely. You're ungrateful. -Want to do lunch? -Sure. -After Cuba. -Where are you staying? At the Libré. Do you own it too? No... So you'll call when you're back? I promise. Take care. What did that big bastard want? Be nice. He did introduce us to Lavoisière. Okay, what did that little bastard want? -Again? -Well, yes... You need to help me with school... What is this? It's from Tom. To thank us. There are 652 of them. You counted them? Yes. She took good care of the kids... No peaking! Here. Tom, we can't accept this. Don't like them? We do but... -You prefer emeralds? -No. Rubies? Nor sapphires, but this is too much... You're my friends. You saw me through the worst. We did. So stop arguing. You already got us 652 roses. I want to! Accept, don't be annoying. She's spectacular! Slut! I feel in great shape! You're rehearsing tomorrow. So what? All this booze... Party-pooper! Let's drink to Thomas Bledish's return! Who's he? The best conductor ever! Hey, you, champagne for everyone, on me! Miss Tightfist wakes up! What? Oh come on! Don't be so touchy! Hey, you! -What's your name? -Laetitia. Laetitia, you inspire me. I'd like to make you sing The Ode to Joy. Other girls are waiting on line. Foxy. I'd fuck her. Nice. Adrienne would love this. It's ok to fuck around sometimes! Something's wrong, isn't it? You're overexcited... I'm not, I'm cured! This can't be. You're high, what's wrong? Something's wrong with you. Quibbling about my gifts, you order me around, scold me... You're bugged because I'm in shape again! Why would I be? When I was unwell, you could show off. Now I'm my fabulous self again, you're jealous! You're on something. We'll talk when you're sober. Yeah! Go to bed, you losers... Come on! Wanna fuck a star? Asshole! Enough! Get out of my way! Yeah, Laetitia. Come fuck, I know you're dying to. I'll go for The Ode to Joy. Brenda... Brenda! Hear that? Go check it out! It's Bledish, with a woman. It's not his wife? Get my camera in the drawer! You're not gone yet? Out! Piotr? It's me. -Did you calm down? -You were sulky. Yeah right. Piotr. I'm on fire, I'm making up for lost time! See? Yes. Good. Listen. It's for Adrienne. I want you to buy a flat I saw. What? I just visited a nice place, I want to buy it. You take care of it, I'm busy. You moved into a new flat less than a year ago. I want to, is it a problem? With what we lost lately, it's not a good move. I'm sick of your advice! What's wrong? Drop it or I'll get another manager. -Where is it? -Place Vendôme. Phone number? Look it up. I'm positive he's on coke. FERRARI Sorry I'm late, I was choosing my new car. On taxpayer money. What's with the trade unionist now? If bitching were taxed, you'd be broke! Let's go! La forza del destino please. Story of my life, kind of... Who cares? Ever read the libretto from Nabucco? It's dumb. "Who wants to buy cheap scissors? "I sell and buy everything. "I make deals promptly." That's not going to win him the Eurovision! Verdi, two points! Come on. Ready? No. Again. No, no! Are you asleep? Wake up! This won't do! The allegro, again! Come on, allegro, joy, joy! Enough now! More energy! You're asleep! Come on! One two three four! But that's not the tempo. Who asked you anything? -Again! -No. What? We're not going to play. Comrades, let's go on strike till the maestro's polite again, and professional. Yes. Very well then. This is a democracy. You want me to be polite. I long to hit a trade unionist. You? Here? I was in the area. Fred, Samya. Nice to meet you. You do have something to do in Cuba? Nothing special. I just wanted to see you. That's it? I really felt like seeing you. He's cool but nuts. Wouldn't you like a guy who flies 6,000 miles just to come say hi? Depends. Is he rich or idle? Both. And who offers you your dream. I'd think he wants something. Though you dumped him for a conductor when you're no music expert... Not true. I've been learning. He still wants you back. My opinion? Love makes one dumb. I agree. Tell her, not me. You're insane. Sorry. Hello? What happened? Tell me it's not so. I'll work it out, Piotr, thanks. I have to go. What? Tom's in the hospital. He allegedly hit a musician. Yes, yes... Fred, my husband's in the hospital. Serves him well! Too bad, it was going well. Just make fun of me! Love is a bohemian child It was always lawless You may not love me but I love you And if I love you watch out! TOO MUCH, MAESTRO! Have you seen this? Of course, I'm the last to know. It's in the paper. Thanks for curing him. He's not cured. He's gone bipolar. -He's not cured? -No. He wasn't himself, he was in a manic phase. Is it serious? Serious? I won a Nobel Prize and I missed what any beginner psychiatry intern could've seen! It's not serious, it's tragic! For you, I understand, but for Tom? Tom? He's going to suffer tremendously. After an exhilarated manic phase, the fall is typically horrendous. It won't be fun. What is this? Your resignation. Do I have to? Hurry up. THE WORLD OF MUSIC ESA EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY I'm most sorry, Adrienne. I'll work it out. No, I'll work it out, don't worry. We must stick together. Don't worry, she'll understand. I'll understand what? Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Bye Adrienne, bye. You're going to miss Elodie's birthday? Tom needs me. Your daughter doesn't? It's just as hard on me as it is on you. On tour you said you'd never been so happy. So what... It was thanks to Tom, and it lasted years. So please be a little patient. We owe him that. He's a cancer in our family! Céline hates me, right? No, why do you say that? She knows you're suffering and believes in you. You're the best. Yeah right. I play music composed by dead guys, played by losers and listened to by degenerates. What a job! A beautiful job. You connect God with men. Yeah. I'm a gravedigger. Cut the bullshit. Come on, have this. Carlo was a better bet. He was on Quatrocil, a drug much like tricyclics. Two weeks, for nothing. Then it was Ziflot, a new drug. It works okay, but made his blood pressure go up. He bled and bled. Even from the eyes, once. I freaked out. I called 911, and the EMT gave him a shot at once. The retard put him on Fratonil. He was already on Gavistache prescribed a week before. Not compatible! He was so dizzy! I went berserk. I said, "You suck , how can you..." I gotta pee. He was speaking with aliens. They got him on Somnolax. Good move. It stopped him in his tracks. Too good to be true! It gave him facial dyskinesia. The jaw, the tongue and the face move spontaneously. Like a tic, only worse. It's a sedative antidepressant but he was so down it made him overexcited. We may try Citatrac, but it's not proved to work. We'll see. I'm annoying you with all this... Friends are here to listen. Unburdening myself helps. Alright. Why don't we go clubbing? I can't... If you change your mind, call me. Room 244. Yeah - sure - it would be fun! Good night. Thanks, good night. TOM CALLING What's the big emerg... Let's go. I'm at the end of my rope. I'm fed up! I hate him! He ruined my career, made me lose our friends, he's always moaning, or crying, always about to hang himself, we don't have sex. He's driving me nuts! Nuts! Why did I leave you for that loser? What can I say? And he stinks! Enjoying this? No, not at all. Right now, I feel like I'm your second choice. You're not! Yes I am. What was I thinking? I fell for his... I don't know. I can't remember. He's hopeless. I did what I could. I've had enough. Will you take me back? We'll see... Maybe. -Should I go with you? -No. Tom... I need to talk to you. Tom, I'm leaving you. We need to talk. Want to sit down? What is it? I'm leaving you. What? Go back to Fred. What? I never saw him again! Let's be honest. It's over for us. I've changed. You loved each other, had more in common. Not true! Save yourself. I can't bear it. You wash me, put on my socks. But I don't mind! One may think it's unfair, undeserved, but the fact is, I made your life hell. And I stink! Not true! I love your smell. Adrienne... Let's drop it. I'll go to my parents' or a clinic. If it's too unbearable... Oh no, don't say that! What am I without you? I'll help you, I'll do everything but I beg you, don't leave me, don't, please! It went okay? I'm not leaving him. What? I was wrong. I'm sorry. I know it's very hard but... I found a clinic. I was wrong. I'm staying. Is he threatening to kill himself? I like you Fred. But I love him. He made your life hellish. He just told me he wants me to be with you, to be happy. I didn't know what I saw in him? Actually, it's quite simple: I love him. Well then stay with him. I won't fight in vain. No grudges? We'll see. A ladybug! -Where? -There! I love ladybugs! Look. It's good luck. What's wrong? Nothing... I'm doing great. Delicious, isn't it? Delicious. -Eat. -I'm not hungry. -Try. -Shut up. Now you're being rude. Sorry. I'm tired. I should go. No you won't. Tonight we're having fun! I don't want to, I want to sleep. it's good for your serotonin level. His acupuncturist says depression actually feeds on sleep. So he mustn't sleep, and the St John's Wort he's taking... -I can't. -Me neither. We should leave because of the kids... We must go home early. Yes, right. We're sorry. You're real friends, huh. Come on, Tom. -What do you mean? -Nothing. We used to have fun. Now my lifestyle is in danger, it's over. Enough bullshit. Hold it, Céline! Fuck you both. Freeloader! Music ignoramus, you took my money, my health! It's true! You killed me with work to support your bitch! Let's go. Bitch, slut! You got pregnant for the money! Enough now. You're fired! Good! Assholes! Freeloaders! I'm sorry, we're sorry. -Tom? -I'm off to bed. Oh, no! We need to go clubbing! The election results in my constituency are clear. The opposition campaigned on the appointment of Thomas Bledish. Though he wasn't my choice, I let others talk me into it. This loss is not my party's but a vote against me. I'll take full responsibility. This failure... Call Carlo. It's like abandoning my son... You have two children! His career is over, over! Dump him with the trash! I won't fall with him. You okay? Yes, I am. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome abort, I mean, aboard... Adrienne Bledish. You should stop flying. For a while. PRIVATE SPACE FLIGHT! UNBELIEVABLE! What was I saying? That since the treatment was altered, it's difficult to focus on ways to kill yourself. I'm sorry, I'm a bit out of it because I'm on 5 milligrams of Nosiphrin and some... Some what? Ralopax. Nonsense. The problem with... With what...? Ralopax. No... The problem is it freezes my jaw and as a result... I can't see. Ralopax, there it is, so it's difficult to talk. You do look a little better. Thanks, you're kind. You don't look younger either. No, Tom, not older, better. Oh, I'm sorry. I apologize. My ears are ringing... By the way, Bobby got the Houston Philharmonic job. Where am I going? I don't know. What were we saying? Dad was saying Bobby just got... Oh, right. I'm sorry. I'm off to beat, I'm bed. They don't know what triggered this? I don't get it. He has it all. You shouldn't say that. I'd kick his butt. Bad idea. It's time to act. We've had enough. It's Christmas, everyone should be kind. Don't try to save the party, it's over. Look at you. You look 10 years older. -You were pretty! -I'm still pretty. You're wilting by the minute! It's your son's fault. -It's her fault. -What? Adrienne is never around, if she were home more, Tom wouldn't be sick. Listen. She didn't earn top degrees to be your retard's maid! Dad... Were she less twisted, she'd have shown him she's as sexy as a trucker. These days a pilot is a mere trucker. And your loser, who can't even hold his baton. What use is he? It's true, you are rednecks! Fuck you! We're filing for divorce. Weare! No kids - that's good. Enough! It's Christmas! Christmas is a happy day! We're happy to be together! Turkey, anyone? Me, sugar pie. -Here mum. -Thanks cutie pie. Mum! Stop! Hello? Hi, it's Adrienne. I know. Merry Christmas. Thanks. I dunno what I'm on, but I pee non-stop. It burns, too. Céline left. Where to? I'm sorry. Come in. Well anyhow, you know.... Why are you here? Céline left. Where to? I don't know. She took her stuff and the kids. Oh really... You want a drink? Some water please... Sure. He's going to get sick... and to fall... What? GROUP THERAPY PRE-FRONTAL CORTEX SCANNER NEW MOLECULE REACTION TO THE NEW MOLECULE (TO CURE ANOTHER REACTION TO ANOTHER MOLECULE) HYPNOSIS "REVIVAL" They're throwing peas, HUGE ONES, "EMDR" (EYE MOVEMENT DESENSITIZATION AND REPROCESSING) I'm hit by a bacon bit. "BIRTH REVIVAL" LIGHT-THERAPY EYE-THERAPY GELOTHERAPY (LAUGHTER THERAPY) Don't worry, it's harmless. ELECTRIC SHOCK THERAPY There... He's injected with curare, under a general anesthesia. The muscles are paralyzed so he's less likely to break a limb. We use this to make sure he doesn't bite himself or smash his teeth... The electrodes are placed bilaterally on the temples... Let's pump it up. The contractions are under control. Ventilation... And it's over. Done. I hope it works. It will. It has to. He'll recover and conduct again. We'll be happy...
