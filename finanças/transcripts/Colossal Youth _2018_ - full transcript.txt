(crackling) (upbeat electronic music) - A quote from Kerouac's novel Big Sur has stuck with me. "Something good will come out of all things yet, "and it will be golden and eternal just like that." I believe this. Nobody knows what the future has in store and that's what's exciting. Years from now these times will on tattered memories, so I'm gonna enjoy the present. (cheerful music) Hey dad. So I'm a senior now and no offense but it's a little embarrassing driving to school with your dad. So I was thinking, I could use a car. You know to save any ounce of coolness that I have. I'm not gonna get a girl. Yeah. (door knocking) - [Ryder's Dad] Ryder, come eat your breakfast. - Coming dad. Let's do this. - So proud. Look at this Roy, our senior. I made your favorite Ryder. Scrambled eggs and sausage. - Thanks mom. - You know, he's a senior now but he's still a dork. - Lizzie if we don't have anything nice to say, we don't say it. - Thanks for the vote of confidence small fry. - My pleasure. - Son, you know if you play your cards right that swimming scholarship is in the bag. All the colleges are gonna be calling you. Now get your food scarfed down so we can get out of here, we're running late. - Well, this being my senior year and all. No offense to you, but it's a little humiliating driving to school with your dad. You know to keep any ounce of coolness, potentially get a date. - (laughs) Keep dreaming. - The way I see it, if you're too embarrassed to ride to school with your old man, then you're gonna have to ride the bus like everybody else. I'll see you at school son. See you later. (peaceful music) - [Ryder's Mom] Come on Lizzie, let's go. - Here you go son. - No way, that's mine? - Honey, with this being your senior year, your dad and I thought you should have your own car. - Wow. Finally. (laughs) - What do you think? - This is perfect. - It's all yours. - Oh man (laughs). - '67 Chevelle, it's a work in progress just like you. I got a heck of a deal on this son and you're not gonna have to car pool with the old man anymore. - No, it's perfect dad, thank you. - Enjoy it son. (upbeat rock music) (engine revving) - Hey Erica, check me out. - Where'd you get this? - Old man Roy finally broke down. Surprised me with a car this morning. - No way. That's awesome. - Come in. Your chariot awaits. - Thank you for saving me from starting senior year with one of those torturous bus rides. Since my oh so loving boyfriend Greg, is a no show. - What are friends for huh? - I'll look out for y'all all right? - All right. - Laters. - Bye. - [Greg] Go get 'em. - Hey Greg, - [Greg] What! You got a car? - 1967 Chevelle. - Oh my god, that is so sick. - So cool man. - Way better. Dude you gotta take me for a spin. - I will, I will. - Erica baby. - Where were you this morning? - I, sorry babe, I couldn't pick you up, I got a thing and then caught up. - You could've at least texted me. Lucky for you I didn't have to take the bus. - Hey thank you so much for picking up Erica bro, I owe you one. - Yeah, no problem, go get her. - Erica babe. Hey Jordan. - Hey guys, what's up? - Nothing much just ready to kick this school year off right. - What's up man? - How it's going? - How you feeling? Good enough. - Hey Jordan. - How's it going Erica? - Yo, I got a car. - No way man, that's awesome. - Thanks man. - This is it guys, we rule the school. One more year in this shit hole. - Dude I can't wait, I'm so ready. - Finally senior year. - "The future is no more uncertain than the present." Right? You know, Walt Whitman, the poet? - (laughs) No, I don't read that man. (laughing) (bell ringing) - Anyway I gotta get to class, I don't wanna be late. Bye. - All right, bye. - Yo, what you get in first period? - Principal. - Students. - Hagerson. - Hagerson. - That's Principal Hagerson to you. And Ryder, I've had a very interesting conversation with your father this morning. And you know the subject. (laughing) So don't screw this up. (snaps fingers) - Did you see the suits he's got with him? He's got undercover cops at the school. I wouldn't surprised if the son of a bitch installed cameras everywhere too. - To do what? So he could keep us in a secret massive control room, feed us propaganda everyday? - 1984, big brother. - Yeah I don't. - Let's-- - Really, oh my god. - Ryder. - [Greg] Later bro. - [Jordan] Good luck. - I didn't see your name on the sign up sheet. - Hey coach, yeah I figured with this being my senior year and all, I'd focus on my studies. - Ryder don't quit on me now. We need you on the free relay team. You're our anchor. Get your paperwork in today for registration. - Okay, sorry. (upbeat rock music) - So Siobhan, I see you're back. - Yeah Blaine, Catholic school's a bitch. Like this is any better. - Yeah, Hagerson's got all these suits walking around. Definitely gonna have to lay low this year. - Yeah I saw that. What are you doing after school? - Hello. All right, take a seat. Good morning, hello class. - What's up dude? - Here comes trouble. - Seniors 2016. I am Mr. De La Vega. Accent on the De. So before we get into this years syllabus, first I wanna read a few lines from your summer reading novel, I hope some of you read it. A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, James Joyce. "Once upon a time and a very good time it was, "there was a moocow coming down along the road "and this moocow that was coming down along the road "met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo. "His father told him that story. "His father looked at him through a glass. "He had a hairy face. "He was baby tuckoo. "The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived. "She sold lemon platt." Can anybody tell me what's going on here? Why does it sound so erratic? Yes Miss-- - Erica, Severson. - Miss Severson you have the floor. - The book starts with Steven Dedalus's father telling him the story of the baby tuckoo and the moocow and Steven identifies himself with the baby tuckoo, because he's young and innocent and hasn't really found himself yet in society. Hence why he sounds erratic. - Excellent Erica, thank you. So I believe that this quote, accurately describes everybody in this room. Of course I'm sure, everyone here doesn't sound so erratic right? But everybody in this room is trying to find himself or herself in society. This is an important transitional time for all of you. After graduation some of you are gonna go on to college. Some of you will go on to the workforce, hopefully all of you will become key contributors to our society. So let's get started. This year we are going to read some diverse authors, right along with Joyce, Salinger, we'll be doing some Shakespeare. (class groans) Plus we're gonna do some of my personal favorite, who's very dear to me, some Chicano authors. Jimmy Santiago Baca, Rudolfo Anaya. Bless Me Ultima, one of the greatest novels of all time. And, when we're done with A Portrait, your next assignment will be Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger. So let's get started. (bell rings) - Siobhan? - Hey Ryder. - What are you um? - Um, what am I doing here? - Yeah. - I got kicked out of that private school and I have to be educated somewhere so here I am. - Wow. - Look, um, I've gotta go, but I'll see you in class okay? - Yeah. (melancholy music) - Well, I've gotta get to class so I'll see you later. - Okay. - Bye. - Oh. (laughing) I'm going on a date with Allison Haines. - All right. - Way to go bro. - I got a feeling that this is gonna be a great year. - It's absolutely gonna be a great year. - [Erica] Yeah, she's cute, congrats. - Good stuff man. I'm stoked for ya. - Hey call me after I wanna hear all about it. - [Erica] Yes, details. (peaceful piano music) - Good afternoon. Hey Jordan, how you doing today bud? - Good, how are you? - [Ryder's Dad] Good. - Have you read this book? - A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. That's a good book. I read it a long time ago (laughs). You know Joyce has another one called Ulysses, it's a much more difficult read, but I think you'll love it. - Thanks for the recommendation. "Good books, good friends and a sleepy conscience, this is the ideal life." - Oh man, Mark Twain that's one of my favorite authors. - Mine too. - Hey Jordan, let's go. - Ryder, come here. What's this about Coach Walters coming in here today to tell me you quit the swim team. You're good at it. You could get a scholarship son. - Dad I don't like to swim, okay. That was your dream, not mine. - Quit getting distracted by all the girls and all the other stupid stuff. Have you even filled out your college applications yet? - Dad, not now. - If you continue to quit when life gets hard, life is gonna quit on you son. - Jordan, let's cruise. - Ryder. - No. - I'm sorry Mr. J. - I really wish my dad didn't work in the library. - It's not all that bad. At least he's confined to the library and doesn't randomly pop into your classes. (laughs) - What are you guys doing after school? - Nothing, I'm pretty beat. - Finishing this book. - I'm gonna re-read that, it's so good. - So good. - I wonder what Siobhan's doing? - Hey didn't you say Siobhan was going with that skater druggie dude, what's his name? - Blaine. - Yeah. - Yeah I think that's her boyfriend. - No, she wouldn't go out with him. - I'm just telling you what I saw. - Looks like your baby momma's spoken for. - I don't care what any of you guys have to say, I'm starting this year off right. I mean I got a car, anything's possible. I'm gonna get Siobhan Alexander. You guys watch. - Alrighty. - I like the attitude man. - Peace. - Hey man, just remember it's not the size of your boat, it's the motion in the ocean. - [Ryder] Yeah real funny Greg. - He knows man, he's rocking a kayak, don't sweat it. - Go get 'em buddy. You know I'm right. (phone ringing) - What's up? - Hey listen, so I was thinking, I think Siobhan coming back to school is a good sign. I mean I think we're meant to be together. - Please Siobhan doesn't care about you. Ryder it's been four years. You've been pining after this girl ever since freshman year, how many times does she have to break your heart before you get the message? - Oh my gosh Erica, why do you hate her so much? - Well, she's hot, she's a psycho bohemian chick and she brings you heartache. - Yeah well she's had some problems. I mean her dad left when she was young. Her parents use her against each other so. - Chicks with daddy issues, those are the worst. What are you gonna do? Save her? - I mean, listen I was planning on taking Siobhan to the prom. On a date. - Care to make a wager? - I bet you $20 I take Siobhan to the prom? - Oh wow look at you Mr. High Roller, deal $20. - And one more thing. - And what's that, Good Lord Sir High Roller? - $20 and a dance with you at prom. At the very least I'll be able to dance with my best friend, if my date doesn't show up. - Flattery will get you everywhere darling. (groans) - How did you get this job? - I need an elective and here I am. (laughs) - I can't believe this schools entrusting you with this. - Wow, and I here I am, thinking about joining the navy. - Joining the navy? Where did that come from? What about baseball at UT Austin? - Now you sound like your dad. - Oh that's a good one. - I do wanna go to UT, desperately, but... what if I don't get in. You know, what if I don't get a baseball scholarship? Perhaps the navy would be the way to go. - But, that's a long commitment, it's what four years of your life right? - Yeah. Yeah four years. But I don't know, I, I genuinely think it might do me some good to be told what to do for once. My old man barely talks to me, it's like he can't wait for me to graduate and move out so-- - Dude I hear you man. I mean I feel like I can never live up to my dads expectations either. You know, never good enough. I remember I played freshman football, he noticed every time I was in, it was a running play. So he told me to tell the coach to put me in as receiver. So the coach finally does and I get this ball from Eric. - Eric (laughs). - Don't laugh. - [Jordan] Hey Eric. - You know, I was one of his signature spinning ducks. Yeah, you already know. - Eric. - Spinning all sideways and everything. A quality pass. - [Jordan] Quality. - Anyways I stretched out for it, I missed it. Anyways I returned to the sidelines and my dad was like "you should have caught the ball." I quit football after that. - Dude, you had to stick with it. I mean, I believe, that a person is defined by their work ethic, all right. I mean, you create your world blink by blink, it's all your perception. I don't know man, I just, I wish you hadn't quit swim team. Honestly, I think you could have been great. (upbeat rock music) * I saw you walking around * Walking around * The sun was hitting the ground * - All right bro, one question. - What's up? - Coach Walters? Would you? - (laughs) No. - No? - Would you? - Absolutely. - Oh my gosh you're a dog Greg. - Are you kidding me, in those shorts? - Dude, I cannot wait to go to college next year at Texas Tech, I hear the girl to guy ratio is like three to one. - But what about you and Erica? I thought you guys were doing great? - She wants to go to Texas, anyway I need to meet more sexually sophisticated girls. We've never even gone all the way. Kind of a cock tease. - Oh. - (laughs) You should've seen your face. I'm kidding man, it's all good. - Dude that's not funny man. - I thought it was kind of funny. I'll see you later. - Not even funny. - I thought it hilarious. - It's not funny Greg. - I'll tell you say what up. - All right, have fun man. (phone ringing) - [Actor On TV] We gotta find that money before they do. Alrighty go! - Hello. (melancholy music) Yeah, you all right? - Thanks for picking me up. - No problem. You okay? - Greg was being a jerk. I'm just tired. I wanna go to bed. Thanks for not making a big deal about it. - Of course. - We have our issues. We don't fight that much, you know, he just wants more of me. But he's, he's good to me you know. - Erica you don't have to make up excuses, I believe ya. - Thanks Ryder. - Yeah. - Remember that time when in the eighth grade, we stayed up all night to get tickets to see The Cure? - Damn scalpers got the best seats. - It's all rigged. - It was still a good show though. - The best. - Well, here we are. Thanks again for bringing me home. You're a sweetheart. - That's what my grandmother says. - Greg could learn a thing or two from you. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Erica, baby, how many times do I have to tell you I'm sorry? Look at this face, doesn't it say I'm sorry? - Fine. I forgive you. Coach Walters works out here? (peaceful music) I'm right here. - What? (groans) What? Oh no babe, it's not like that, I was looking for technique. - Hey Siobhan. - Leaving early today, just not in the mood you know. - What are you gonna do? - Hop in and I'll show you. - Okay. (peaceful music) - You know why I left private school? Well, after my dad left, I'd get drunk everyday just to deal with everything. And those stupid bitches at school, I slept around a lot. Well, anyway, I never finished the year. They sent me to rehab. I was sober for a short while, but in rehab I learned that I'm an old soul. I'm a wanderer. I often wonder if I'll ever get where I'm going. I feel so alone sometimes, you know? - You're not alone. I mean you can't blame yourself for your dad leaving you. Things aren't easy okay. I'll help you figure it out. - Do you believe in past lives? - I guess so. - I often dream of a past life. Have you ever had your cards read? - No, what's that? - Tarot cards. I've been studying them lately, they work. I believe the past is not fixed, the future's not fixed, it's all in the cards. We need some music. (classical music) Music's been my salvation. Keeps me sane. Cheaper than a psychiatrist. (laughs) I'm into new wave, shoegaze, dream pop. Bands like Cocteau Twins, Smiths, Felt, Beach House. I'm also into classical music. I'll have to share my mix with you some time. - That'd be cool. - This is Paganini's 24th Caprice. You know, it's said that Paganini's mother sold her sons soul to the devil to become the worlds greatest violinist. (classical music continues) We better head back. (relaxed rock music) - Ryder. - [Together] Ryder. - Ryder. - Ryder. - Ryder. - Ryder. (gasps) - Oh shit dude, you scared me. - We were just driving by and thought we'd come and see how it went with Siobhan? - Well, we kissed. - Right on, okay. - Right on man. - Okay, so did you, you know turn on the water, check the water temperature a little bit huh? (laughs) - [Jordan] Yes, good job man. - [Greg] Yeah did you smash in the back seat? No, you're more a front seat kind of a guy. (laughing) Which one huh? - No. - [Greg] Which position? - No, it wasn't like that dude, you're a freaking sicko. - [Greg] Oh. - [Jordan] What? - We just, we just talked and things led on to another. - Why hell yeah man, that's awesome. Guys, I'm thinking we kick this evening up a notch. - Right on. - Let's go fishing. - I love fishing. I went with cousins, we caught some tilapia, it was so fun. - Not necessarily that fishing, yeah. - Dude, not, yeah not that kind of fishing J-dog. Different, but not that one. - "You have your way, I have my way, as for the right way, the correct way and the only way, it does not exist." - Okay, Nietzsche. - Wow, okay yeah, that's actually really impressive. - Thanks man you know. - What? - I'm not really as dumb as I seem. - Yeah. (laughing) - What? Hey uh, your dad got any beer here? - I can't believe we're doing this to Principal Hagerson. Shit, if we get caught, I'd never get a scholarship. - Relax Jordan, have a beer. - All right it's ready. - All right, let's go. (whimsical music) Go. (laughing) Let's go fishing. (window taps) (laughing) - He looks like a dumpling in whitey tighteys. Now what? - That's right, you heard something but you don't know what the hell it is. (window tapping) (laughing) - Dude let me see, let me see. - Bring him on home, bring him on home. - Oh dude he's getting so pissed. (laughing) Wait, wait a second. Wait, where'd he go? - I don't know is he in the bathroom or something? - Oh shit he's coming. He's coming. Go, go, go, go, go. - Slackers! - [Together] Suck it Hagerson! - Slackers, slackers! - Okay so to reiterate right, you don't breathe in the middle of the verse line, just like rap. "To be or not to be" (inhales) "that is the question." Wrong. You don't breathe in the middle of the verse line. "To be or not to be that is the question, "Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer "the slings and arr." Wrong. You don't run on either, right just like rap. "Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer." (inhales) "The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune." Right, just like to rap you have to know where to breathe in the verse line. All right? All right, so let's get together and work this out in different groups. Why don't we have, Jordan, you and Erica, the smart ones. Allison, why don't you guys get together and work on it? And we've got Alex, Janice and Lindsey why don't you guys get together in a group? You guys get together with Justin. Siobhan and Ryder, you guys get together and work. Carlos, Portia here, you guys can work together there. Corey and Emily. Katarina, you can get together with Jordan's group okay? Let's get into these groups. Hi. - Confused? - So confused. - All right look. So "now is the win ter of our discontent." This one happens to be an inversion because the syllables are stressed. - I totally don't get this stuff. - Yeah. So I was thinking, maybe we could go out tonight? - I already have plans. - Oh yeah. - Yeah, Friday I always go the Amp Room, 9:00 p.m. to close. They have the best DJ and after the week I've had, I'm in desperate need of some good music. - Well I mean I could always meet you there? - Come with if you'd like? * Fall back in love - Okay. - [Siobhan] Elmo! - Siobhan where you been? Oh my god, you look great. - Thank you, how are you? - I'm doing good, you good? - Good. Do you mind if my friend gets a stamp? - Sure, absolutely, hold on. Let me stamp you guys. Go on in. Y'all have a great time guys. - Thanks. - Thank you. - Do you have fake ID? - No, I don't need one. I've been coming here since I was 13. It's like another home. Stay here and I'll get us some drinks. - Okay. - [Siobhan] JilL. - Hey. - Hi, how are you? - I'm good how are you? - Good, I haven't seen you in so long. - I know. Just working, you know, making money. - Good, good good good. - Who's the fella? - [Siobhan] Um he's just a friend, he's really nice. - All right, what can I get you? - The usual please. - Yeah sounds good. What you crazy cats up too? - Just came here for the awesome DJ! - All right, have fun. - Thank you. - You're welcome. (upbeat electronic music) - Here you go. This place is cool. - Yeah, yeah, it's cool. Do you wanna dance? - Um, look Ryder, we're not together okay. - Look Siobhan, I'm getting mixed signals here. I mean the other day at the museum and then we kissed in the park and I thought we were together. - Sure we kissed, but it felt right for the moment. - Siobhan, look I wanna be with you. I thought you felt the same way. - Hey Blaine. - Who's this? - No one, look can I talk to you. - Hey relax all right. I've got a few more people I gotta see around here, then I'll come back and I'll take care of you. - Okay. - What was that about? - Nothing, what do you mean? - I am interrupting you two? - No, we have an understanding and it's really none of your business. - Siobhan, that kid is a dope dealer. - This is a hot mess, forget I told you to come here okay? (window tapping) (moans) - Can I talk to you? - Maybe she doesn't like you as much as your brain thinks she does. There are so many other girls out there besides Siobhan, you can do way better. Ryder, I've known you since the fourth grade, you're a sweet guy okay. - Yeah, you were that cute girl with the double ponytails. - Pigtails. - Yeah that's what I said. - No, no it wasn't (laughs). - You sat right in front of me and you were always so nice to me. (melancholy music) Remember that time I accidentally threw up on you? - Yes, oh my god, I tried to block that out of my memory. Thanks for bringing it back up. - I'm sorry about that. - I loved that dress so much, my mom made me throw it away. - You know I had a crush on you? - I never knew that. - Yeah it's true. I even carved your name on my tree. - That's so sweet. - Oh I'm hopeless. - Romantic. - What can I say, I was raised listening to the Beatles. Sweet guys finish last anyways right? - No, look, you've put Siobhan on this pedestal but she's not worthy Ryder. Okay if you're giving it to your all and it's not enough, you're probably giving it to the wrong person. She deserves better. You, you deserve someone that appreciates you. - I love her. I mean she's all I think about. I just need to get her to see that, that we can be great together, you know. I'm being stupid. - You're not being stupid. - Yeah I am. - Don't say that. You just can't make someone love you. It sort of just happens. - Yeah. Thanks for listening to my bullshit anyways. - It's not bullshit Ryder. Look, you should really get home, your dad's gonna be super worried about you. - Where the hell have you been son? - I slept the night at Greg's. - Why in the hell didn't you call? Your mother was worried sick about you. You have got to straighten up son. - Dad, not now okay. - If not now, when? All you wanna do is blow things off. Go out and have fun with your friends. You need to get your ass in gear so you can get into college. - Okay whatever. (bell rings) - User. - If you've got a problem with me, then say it. - I'll be perfectly honest with you. I don't like you and I don't like what you're doing to Ryder. So stay away from him. - Siobhan wait. - Not today Ryder, leave me alone. - What's wrong? - I've gotta get out of here, I can't deal with this shit, not today. - Why? - My parents had it out with me this morning, okay. All they do is fight, it's like they treat me as their emotional pinata. Today they were on top of their game. And on top of that your stupid little friend got on my ass, I hate my life. - Siobhan wait. * We're falling, just hold on tight * * We'll chase the night - Why did you have to drag me here? You're stupid for following this chick. There's this thing called stalking, it's illegal you know. - Will you calm down please. Okay, she left school crying today. - She's a big girl, she can handle herself. - Dude, the least you can do is come with me and make sure she's all right okay. - No, that's all they have is the bass, the acoustic. - Bass and try to keep it. - And the electric. Now they actually didn't have drums you know. - Hey, hey, hey. - Oh Siobhan, Siobhan! Siobhan, Siobhan. (melancholy music) Why do you hate yourself so much? (phone bleeps) (upbeat rock music) - All the time. - All the time. - Oh look who decided to show up. A little late. - Dude you touched his freaking hand, are you kidding me? - I couldn't help it, it was ridiculous. - Okay, I'm just gonna sit here okay. - Okay. (laughs) - Where's Greg? - He's sick, but this badass band was playing and there was no way I was gonna miss it, like you did. But, um, they're coming back in June and if you're not there, I just, I don't think we can be friends anymore Ryder. - Is that so. - Yeah. Mm-hmm. (laughs) Have you decided where you wanna go to college yet? - I guess I've given it a little bit of thought, but then again there's SAT's and my PSAT's aren't exactly stellar. - Yeah I feel you. Heck, I have no idea how I'm gonna do it. I wanna go to Texas, but there's no way I'm gonna score that high on the SAT's. - Oh my god. You're a brain Erica. You have a plan, who knows, maybe Texas State will lower their standards and accept yours truly. - Shut up are you kidding me? I saw the way you were in English, teaching Siobhan that Shakespeare stuff. You were ridiculous. - No it's nothing. Come on, I wanna show you something. - Where are we going? - Doesn't matter? Let's go. It's an adventure. - Ah it's an adventure. - Hey, I'm just gonna catch a ride with him, cool? - All right. - All right bye guys. - See you later. - Bye. - Bye guys. Where we going? - Um, a really cool spot, where I'm gonna kill you? - Carl's Junior? - Yep. - You know what I'd like to do after graduation, is travel to Europe. - Oh I hear you. Anywhere along the Mediterranean. - I mean my dream would become some painter or writer. You know live in a small Spanish style fishing village or something like that. - That sounds like a lonely, yet romantic existence. But that would only fuel your tortured soul and inspire you more. (romantic music) - I say that we get Eurail passes. - Travel all over Europe together. - Mm-hmm. I like that. We will walk the beaches of Spain and party in the streets of Rome. - You got a backpack? - A backpack? - I mean we'll walk from village to village with only what we can carry on our backs. - Oh. Well you're a gentleman right, you can carry mine? - No, you gotta carry your own. - Come on, you wouldn't help little old me? We can't do this. - Erica wait. - I don't know what else to say. Thank you. You saved my miserable life. - I'm just glad to hear you're all right. It's the last you'll see of Blaine though. Cops busted him after searching his locker. - I know. Look, I also wanna apologize about that night at the Amp Room a while back. It's totally not cool of me to do that to you. - [Ryder] I'm glad to hear that. - I've gotta run, I have a doctors appointment. I'll see you later. - Okay. (coughing) - Oh Mr. Money. - Ah. - Thank you for, for covering for me today, you're a lifesaver. - No problem Mr. De La Vega. Your class is safe in my hands. Fist bump. - Huh? - Bump the fist. A little bit of boom. - I. - Little bit of love rocket. - No. - A little explosion of love on the Earth's. Okay, well namaste. - Yeah namaste. - Namaste, peace. Peace plus love equals Mr. Money. (laughing) Namaste children, settle, settle, settle, namaste. My name is Mr. Money and I'm your substitute teacher. Wow, your aura's are just spinning out of control. Your chakra's are on fire, particularly your root chakra. (laughing) Don't worry, it's just puberty. It will end some time in mid-30's. So, brother De La Vega is out sick today with an extremely contagious cough. He wouldn't even, boosh, explode the rock. But this man would yeah? Give me some dap. Hey what a guy. - I got you Mr. Money. - Namaste, what a sweetie. Brother De La Vega failed to leave any lesson plan, so, talk amongst yourselves. Just don't get too loud okay. Go. - Everybody is out sick. Even Allison's gone man. - It sucks. (whimsical music) - [Jordan] The best lesson I've ever had. I'm feeling educated, more and more by the minute. - Let's get out of here, come on, come one, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Come on. - Hey, um Mr. Money, I need to get something from my locker. - Yeah me too actually. - I need to supervise them, they get distracted. - Dudes and dudette, senior skip day? - Yeah. - Run while you still can. Hi.

A bunch of suits by the front doors, so let's go out the back. My car's there. - So, about the other night. - Ryder, don't. Let's just pretend it never happened okay? So I saw you talking to Siobhan the other day, how's she doing? - She's good. First day back at school and we had, had a little moment there. - That's good. - She apologized for embarrassing me at the Amp Room. - Wow, an apology from Siobhan? What, that's gotta be like a first time or something right? Guess you could say things are getting pretty serious? - (laughs) Oh shut up. - Are you, you still planning on taking her to prom? Or should I just take my $20 now? - It's not over till it's over. - Okay, yeah. - Yeah, you know. Still planning on asking her, nothing can get in my way. (peaceful music) - [Girl] Hey Ryder, nice car! - Thanks, want a ride? - For sure. - Hey Luke, what's up man? - Hey what's up Ryder? - What's up guys? Hey what are you doing for spring break? - I don't have any plans really. - Well a bunch of us are going to Padre, you wanna go? - Not really my scene, went there last year, once you been there you been there, you know. - Yeah. - Besides, there's this new art film at the Bijou, I think I might check it out. - That's cool. - Yeah. Look, I've gotta run. I have another doctors appointment to go to so. - Siobhan wait. - Yeah. - Um, look I think you're amazing, and beautiful and I know you've been through a lot. But um, I wanna be there for you. I like you. Listen, um, I really wanna take you to prom. She said yes. - Who? - Siobhan. - To do homework together? - No, to go to prom, boom. - No way. - Yes way, she said yes, whoop. - Good for you Ryder. - Hey you okay man? You're not really saying very much. - Oh man, I'm just feeling the pressure. We got that big game against Churchill tomorrow night and word is there's gonna be some college recruiters there. - Dude that's awesome. - Yeah, but I mean, what if I whiff on every pitch thrown to me, you know. - You're gonna do fine. You always do. - Thanks man. - Ryder, by the way, excellent on that Catcher in the Rye essay. - Thank you sir. - Very good work. - Thank you. It's actually the first book I've read that I actually enjoyed. - Really? - Yeah. - Check this out. Here, I think you'll enjoy this one too. Jack Kerouac, On The Road. Kind of reminds me of you. It's my personal copy, you can have it. - Oh thank you. - You got it. - Mr. De La Vega, did you actually play professional soccer? - (laughs) Yeah, I was pretty good until I blew out my knee. Man I miss that game. Hey, I'll show you a picture of me scoring a Championship goal. - Wow. That's so cool. - I had good legs huh? - So you guys going to Padre for spring break? - Yeah, aren't you? - No. I've gotta study. Taking the SAT next Monday. - Is Greg still going? - Yeah for sure. You think he'd actually pass up a chance to party to study with me? If you haven't noticed he's a little selfish. Trouble with being the first born I guess. You'll have a blast though. - Yeah we will. - The water is so cold there, you're gonna have to be careful. (laughs) - Do you hear about our boy here? - I did it, I got into UT and I got a scholarship. Gonna be a LongHorn! - No way dude. That is so cool man. Congratulations. - Thanks bro. - This kid, better remember us when he's big time right? - Yes. - You better. - I might, I might. Seriously guys, I am so stoked. This weekend I'm gonna hang out with my cousins, we're gonna go fishing, we're gonna celebrate, it's gonna be awesome. - Oh man, I'm so bummed you're not coming to Padre with us though bro. - Right. - I will next time man, I promise. - Sounds good, we'll hold you to that. - [Jordan] You better. - You ready to go? - Let's go. - Okay guys I'll see you later. - Later guys. Wow. Dude I knew you were gonna do that. - Really? - I knew, no doubt in my mind, I knew it. I mean you came, you saw, you conquered. - Veni, vidi, vici. - I have no idea what that means but-- - Well, you said it already. Allison is waiting on me. But have an awesome time in Padre, bro. - We will, we will dude. - You better. - We will man. Congratulations dude. - Thanks man. - I'll see you later. - All right bye. - Bye.

That is spring break. - Oh it smells nice. - Oh I love it. - Delicious. - Hey we're taking your car to Padre right? - Yeah man, we're good. - Cool, 'cause mine's in the shop so I ain't got wheels. - Wait. Wait, where's my car? - You parked it there? - Yeah, yeah I parked it here this morning. Someone stole my car. Oh shit. - Oh damn. - Oh my god. - Oh shit. Why does this always happen to me huh? Why not this thing? - I'm so sorry bro. - Damn it! Um, I gotta tell my dad man. What do I say to my dad? - Um, I don't man, your dad scares me. - Give me ideas, I don't know what to say dude. - Blame it on Hagerson, that's what I do. - Hagerson stole his car? - Yeah Hagerson stole it. Dude that guy's. - No, that's not funny, no seriously dude, That guy chased our car with a bat. - I would just not say anything at all. - Dude that guy's crazy. - Whoa. - Yeah. - Well that was fun. Wanna know what my old man told me? I should have been more responsible. He asked if I locked the car. "No dad, I left it in with the keys in the ignition." - So, what about Padre? - It's no go man. Unless you wanna rent a car. - I don't have money for that. - Neither do I. - Well, you know, when in doubt Greg it out. Let's roll. (upbeat rock music) - Okay pour those.

So you gonna give me my $20 now or-- - No. - Or later? - I am not paying you $20 until I see her at prom. Because for all I know she could ditch. - Oh shut up Erica. - I'm just kidding. - So you still hate her? - If she makes you happy, then I'm happy. (laughing) I hate her. - Yeah I can tell. - You know you said that you'd kiss Siobhan before, but I just don't believe you. - Why not? - I just don't. - Well shut up. - Look, okay, you are going to prom with Siobhan and you probably gonna kiss her right? And me being the great friend that I am, I think I'll help you practice. - Seriously? - Yeah. - I mean I kissed you that night at Limelight. - Yeah. (retching) - Oh shoot.

(cheering) Y'all can go back to doing whatever you were doing. - Oh shoot. You okay Erica? - I'm sorry. - No it's fine, sit up. - You threw up on me in fourth grade and now I almost threw up on you. - Yeah, well at least you missed okay. (retching) Oh I, spoke too soon, You know what, I'm gonna run inside and get you some ginger ale, it'll probably help with your stomach. - Thank you. - Don't move please. Okay, I'll be right back. Beautiful. Hey, have you seen Greg? - Yeah, he's just there. - Over there. - Yeah. - Beautiful thank you. Excuse me bro. (moaning) Greg. - Get out of here, get out of here. - Oh shit. - Hey I'm sorry I know you told me to wait. - No. - I just wanna make sure you're okay. - Here, okay that's-- - Oh I'm good. I think I'm gonna go find Greg. - Let's go outside Erica. - I'm just, I'm just gonna find Greg. Is he in there? (moaning) Greg. - Erica. - Come here Greg. Come here. - How could you do this? - Shoot. Erica. - Erica. - No. - Erica. - No. - Erica! Oh shit. - Let's go back and finish what we started. Come on. - [Ryder] What was that Greg? - Ryder, you the asshole, you could've kept her from going in there. - Don't you dare put this on me okay. You're the dumb ass that's messing around when you've got someone special like Erica. - You jealous bastard. You've already got your weird ass Siobhan chick, you go and fuck up my relationship? - Wow Greg wow. Real cool. - Oh, is it because you got a hard on for a chick who doesn't give a shit about you? - You know what Greg, screw you. - You know what, bring it on. Let's go. (sirens blare) - [Partygoer] Cops, cops. - [Girl] Go, go, we gotta get out here, go. (bell rings) (melancholy music) - Hey Erica, you haven't been responding to my texts. You okay? - Excuse me everyone. I regret to inform you that this past weekend we lost a student of ours. Jordan Oliver died this weekend. Apparently there was a storm and it sank their boat. (somber music) (sobbing) Thank you, all of you for being here. Jordan was taken from us way too soon. Intelligent, kind. (sobbing) He was one of the best students I ever had the honor of teaching. He will be missed. Now one of our students, Ryder Jensen, would like to say a few words on his behalf. Ryder. - Hello everybody. I'm Ryder Jensen. As most of you know, Jordan loved poetry. And um, he was on the bravest people I've ever met. This is Lord Alfred Tennyson's Ulysses. "Tho' much is taken, much abides "and tho' we are not now "the strength which in old days moved earth and heaven. "That which we are, we are. "One equal temper of heroic hearts, "Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will "to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield." Jordan never backed down from a challenge. He faced it head on, whether it was baseball or school, he faced it. He never backed away from his destiny and we can all honor Jordan by facing our destiny. By striving, to seek, to find and not to yield. No matter how scary it may be, we all need to stay strong for Jordan cause that's how he would have wanted it. (melancholy music) - I really do wish you the best. You deserve somebody great. - I'm sorry sweetheart, it'll be all right. Honey, I'm going to go and get the car. - Erica are you okay? - I can't believe he's gone. - I know, me neither. (Church bell rings) It's okay Erica, it's okay. (sobbing) It's gonna be okay. - I'm sorry that I've been so distant recently. It's just really overwhelming. Greg cheating on me and, and then this. - You can't think like that, okay. - Apparently he was cheating on me with others too. That's what you get when your girlfriends a virgin. - I'm sorry, I didn't. I didn't know. - It's okay. I'm fine. We were very different. You know, I guess I was just blind to it. Out of fear of being alone. - I don't really think he ever knew what he had. - On a better note, I got accepted into Texas. - That's so, so great. - With one stipulation of course. Successfully completing a summer school, which happens to start right after graduation. - Oh. I mean, everything's gonna work out. I know it will, you always make it. - Well have fun at prom. You finally got Siobhan. - Hey. - What do you want? - Not gonna try to kill me are ya? - After what you did to Erica, I probably should. - Parents home? - Nope. That's why I got a beer. - Can I have one? - Sure, you take what you want anyways. - Look, I'm sorry, I screwed up. - I know. - Erica doesn't deserve me. She's better off without me anyway. I lost her but, I don't wanna lose you bro. Can you forgive me? - Yeah I can. - All right. - What if this is as good as it gets? These are the best times of our lives. - Man if in 20 years I look back and these are the best years of my life, it'd be pretty sad. - But at least you'll have that. I mean what about Jordan, he had everything going for him. And now he's dead. - It sucks what happened to Jordan man. Life is unfair. Hey, here's to Jordan. - Jordan. (upbeat rock music) - Look at you, so handsome. Don't forget the cressage, you know how to put it on? - Yes mom. Mom, I'm good. Thank you. - Well look at you Mr. GQ. - I still can't believe you're taking Siobhan Alexander. - You better be careful with my car. - Thanks dad. * Your heart is taken * Your heart is taken * Your heart is taken * Your heart is taken * Your heart is taken * Your heart is taken - Hey, what's up man? - What's going on man? - Hey. - Hey. Where's dream girl, she didn't ditch you did she? - No, no, no, she's, she's in the restroom. - Oh all right well. All right man, we'll see you on the dance floor. - All right guys have fun. - Bye. - All right. - You okay? - I'm fine, come on, where's the alcohol? - Siobhan, Siobhan, calm down, Okay, let's go sit down. - No, I wanna dance. - Siobhan, you're gonna get us kicked out of here. - Leave me alone Ryder. Gosh this is a hot mess, I'm calling my mom. - Siobhan stop. - I don't wanna be someone's crush. You think you know me but you don't. - I know you pretty well. - You don't know me. - Siobhan stop. I love you. - You don't love me Ryder. I treat you like shit and you're still nice to me. - That's cause I love you though. - No, the more you look at this, the more you'll realize that you don't truly love me. You just want me. I just wish I felt the same way about you. But, I can't feel something that isn't there. You're going to make someone very happy someday. Goodbye Ryder. (melancholy dance music) * There is a smile that's on your face * * It's like the dreams I always chased * * I guess for us that's the way it goes * * But in my heart I think we're right * - Hey. - Wow Erica, you look, you look amazing. - Thanks. My mom thought I'd regret it if I didn't go. - I'm sorry. - It's okay, I'm fine. It's over with. Where's Siobhan? - She ditched. - Should have known. - Yeah, guess I owe you that $20 after all. - I am so glad to be done with this scene. I don't even know why I came. I, uh, think I'm gonna go. - Wait Erica, don't, don't leave. I mean, I would like to dance with the most badass chick here If she doesn't mind? - Sure. (cheerful rock music) Ryder, um. I just want you know that I've, I've always liked you. But um, you're still in love with Siobhan and that's, that's totally cool. Just do me a favor and don't call me anymore. I can deal with not being Greg, but I'd wanna be with you. And if you don't want that, I, um, I think it's just best if we don't talk anymore. - No Erica wait. - No. Just, respect my feelings Ryder. Please. (somber music) - Oh shit. (siren blares) - Good evening sir. How you feeling? - Good. - I'm placing you under arrest for suspicion of DWI. (cell door closes) - [Announcer] Ryder Jensen, you've posted bail. (TV show sounds) - I'm going round to Greg's. - Are you fricking out of your mind Ryder. - Greg's my friend. Okay, I've known him since elementary school, I probably won't even see him again. - What were you thinking Ryder? - I messed up, okay dad. - I'll say you did. - Honey, honey this isn't helping. - Boy this is my house and as long as you live under my roof, you're gonna follow my rules. Do you understand? - Then I'm out of here. - Ryder, no. Ryder get back here. Stop! What is wrong with you? You think this is some kind of game? When are you going to wise up son, you can't go around thinking just one big party after another, every fricking night. You got your whole future ahead of you son. Don't go throwing it away. - Would you stop saying that? I feel like I'll never measure up to you. Like I'll never be good enough. You just yell at me and tell me to apply myself. You expect me to randomly get it? Dad, look, nothing goes my way. Okay, I have the worst luck. I loved a girl that doesn't love me back. And now I realize too late that the girl who's always been there for me, loves me. And you know what? She's the one. And she wants nothing to do with me. I get so confused dad. What if I don't get into college? What am I supposed to do then? I don't know what my future is. I'm scared dad, I'm just scared. - I'm sorry son. I never meant to hurt you in any way. I've been doing my best just trying to teach you and trying to show you how to do things, and what to do to prepare you to be a man. I haven't had anybody to teach me. My dad was never around, you know that. I'm doing the best I can. I just want the best for you and I want the best for your sister. I want you to have more, and better than I've had. And more than I've been able to provide for you. I love you son with all my heart. Please forgive me if I hurt you son. I love you son. I love you Ryder. - I love you too dad. - Everything will be okay son, I promise you. Everything will be okay Ryder. Let's get in the house before your momma has a heart attack. (upbeat music) - Jordan would be proud. - Slackers! This is a madhouse and it's run by slackers! What am I? The prince of darkness? I don't deserve this. God I gotta retire. Why don't they just rename me, make me Principal Litterbox, everybody craps on me anyway. - Check it out Ryder, they made a memorial page for Jordan in the yearbook. - Oh Jordan. God I miss him. - Hey let's take a photo huh? - Yeah. - Hey, Miss Jensen would you take a photo for us please? Thank you. - [Ryder's Mom] One more. - I'm so proud. - Thanks. - Congratulations. - Thank you so much. - And you sweetheart. I love you. - I love you too, see you in the car. - Congratulations son. - Thanks dad. - Congratulations darling. Greg, good luck to you. - Thank you Mr. Jensen. - Congratulations guys. - Thanks. - Congratulations. - Well I gotta go, so I'll see you guys later. - All righty. - Bye Allison. - Well, we had a good run. - We had one hell of a year man. - Ryder man, I see you in the future living large having finally found your soul girl. You'll have five kids, one of them named Greg. - Yeah okay. - And they all dance to whenever music is present. - Seems about right. - Hey don't forget I'm having a party tomorrow night. - Okay. - See you around man. - Love you dude. - Love you bro. - Congratulations young man. - Thank you. - All right. - I'll see you in the car. - Yes. - Hey Ryder. - Hey. - I'm sorry about all the shit that went down this year. - I'm not gonna lie, it did hurt, but I'm okay. I know I deserve to be loved and I hope you find love one day too. - Thank you. - Well, good luck to you Siobhan. - I will never forget what you did for me that night. You saved my life and like I said, you are gonna make someone very happy someday. Look, I've gotta run. Take care Ryder. - Okay bye. Hey Siobhan wait. - Yeah. - What do you think about Erica Severson? - [Ryder's Dad] Hey son, you all right? - Yeah. - Nobody ever said that life is easy. Here, you got some mail. Love you. - [Erica Voiceover] Hey Ryder. First off you're probably wondering why I wrote you a letter instead of texting you. Well, I accidentally deleted your number from my phone. Okay. Actually, I intentionally deleted it. Kind of regret that. Anyway, I hope this letter finds you well. I've settled into the routine of summer school and I really like the independence. The campus is beautiful and there is so much to do in Austin. Thank you again for that dance at prom. I will always cherish that moment. I still remember that night we kissed. I wish I knew the truth about Greg then. Perhaps things could have been different. Sometimes the person you want most, is the person you are better of without. You don't put up with their disrespect because you love them, you put up with it because you don't love yourself enough to know you deserve better. Ryder, you're a good person with a big heart. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Your friend always, Erica. (uplifting music) - [Ryder Voiceover] Dear Erica. I'm glad to hear you're doing great. You'll do awesome cause you're so smart. This past month I've learned a lot about myself. I've had time to reflect on everything that happened this past year. Sometimes we just fall in love with the wrong person. It just happens. I don't hate Siobhan. I'm actually thankful for the experience. Plus she had really great taste in music, I'll have to share it with you. I'm going to community college nights to get my grades up. I've been reading a lot lately. Jack Kerouac's, On The Road, reminds me about our talk of traveling the world that night we kissed. A quote from Kerouac's novel Big Sur has stuck with me. The story ends on a surprisingly optimistic high note when he writes "something good will come out of all things yet, "and it'll be golden and eternal just like that." I believe this. Nobody knows what the future has in store and that's what's exciting. Years from now, these times will only be tattered memories, so I'm gonna enjoy the present. Anyway thanks for thinking of me and I hope to see you soon. Take care, Ryder.
