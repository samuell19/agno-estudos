Directed by YUKISADA Isao Thank you for flying with us. What's up with that guy? I'll go find out. Excuse me, sir, is anything wrong? What's that? Strange, huh? Yes. A child's shoe, here... What's going on? Take a look at this. What is it? But why here? You know what? This belonged to someone I know... What? I wonder if you'll believe the story... Want to hear it? Please. Back when I wanted never to grow up but to be a kid forever. All of us have events in our lives that we'll never forget. Did you know this fact? Bees aren't built to fly but somehow they manage it. Know why that is? Because they think they can. Just like the Wright brothers and Lindbergh. They believed... then they flew. Belief made their wish come true. People call it miraculous. What I'm about to tell you is the story of another miracle. Into the Faraway Sky Dad... Dad, pull over. "No Airport On Our Land" Hey, what're you doing? Don't just help yourself! Don't drink my milk! What do you think you're doing? What's that? Look... Come on. We're off. Well done, lad. Good morning. 'Morning, sir. The milkman's here, boss. Good morning, sir. Well done. Bit late today, though, eh? I got caught up. No worries. Once you discover it, it's hard to quit. I used to be at it all night long. It's not that... Who do you get off on? Pop star idols? Sophie Marceau was a major inspiration for me. Way to go, Boss... a foreigner. Don't call her that! It's not your teacher, Sawako is it? Not in a million years. Of course. A kid like you couldn't appreciate a woman's charms. It's nothing like that. I met some strangers. Who? Dunno. A guy and his kid in a strange car. A guy and a kid? A new development? No idea. 'Morning, piggies... Tsuchida Dairy I'm home. Welcome back. You're late. Monkey business, I expect. Stick to the milk business in future. Okay, okay. Eat up quick and get to school. I know. New Moon 'Morning. 'Morning, kids. Good morning, Miss. She's a nice girl. She's a lovely girl. Back in the day we knew girls like that. I heard she's getting married. That's good news. I wonder... This is for you. Not in front of the kids. Don't be silly. We're getting married after all. But... I love you. I'd prefer you didn't wiggle your neck so. Excuse me. Miss Sawako! It's Akahoshi with his pigeons. Is it true that he eats 'em? There's Erika. Hello, Kohei. Thanks for the milk. It was delicious. Erika, my love... Kohei, what's wrong? You got a nose-bleed. Mayoi Elementary School Hey, Kohei. Did you bring it? What? Stool sample. Heck, I forgot. Damn. Me, too. They're giving enemas to those who forget. You're kidding. If I can't go, I can't go... Lavatory Tonbo, done it yet? Not yet. Good morning, all. Come in. Don't get too excited. Sit down, everyone. This is your new classmate Kusunoki Ryosuke. Be nice to him. Kusunoki-kun. My father got transferred from Tokyo. Nice to meet you. He's so cute... Erika. You got a nose-bleed. There it is. A girl saw a little rose Blooming in the field Such a pretty color. Such a lovely smell That rose in bloom Did you go? Sure did. A big one. It stinks. Forgot to wash my hands. Don't, that's gross. Go sit down. Who the hell are you? Kohei, be quiet. But Miss, this is my seat! Be nice and let our new friend have it. Kohei, get over there. Let's start again. Who is he? A transfer student. Let's give thanks to have been born in this glorious land. To be able to live in a humble, pure yet joyous way. As the greats, from Lao-tse to Aristotle beseech us: "Know thyself". Carving up mountains, trampling the meadows, destroying the very nature around us... This ridiculous government scheme of building an airport Let us resolve from the bottom of our hearts to oppose it with every fiber of our beings. The jerk's in a cast but isn't even injured. Apparently Sawako said something to him. We don't need a damn airport in our village! That's the spirit! Let's not lose control of our birth-place. That's the spirit! Save our forests! That's the spirit! We will not be moved! That's the spirit! So, everyone... Let us sing our song of solidarity. Take it away. We're all born from the same earth Comrades of the land, are we A scarab spins the earth along the red road Let's yell out together to keep sleep at bay The morning sun rises in the West A dragon flies to Eastern skies A scarab spins the earth along the red road Stupid old jerk. Who does he think he is? Wait here. I want to go inside. Says who? I'm in charge of the new airport construction. You're the one... We've been waiting for you. Sorry it's out in the sticks. Let me welcome you. I won't talk to you. Who's in charge, here? What? Hold it there. Ouch. That hurts... Pardon my underling's behavior. I'm the land-owner, Tendo. Kusunoki, newly-entrusted with the airport project. I'll tell you first off; we will not be moved. You're the 5th we've seen. You're wasting your time. I dislike backroom dealing. And I Like local bullies even less. How dare he... My name's Kusunoki and I'm here to build an airport. These are my orders from our government. Move aside. Listen, everyone. Have you ever wondered what Life is like in the big, wide world outside? Of course you have. You stand on the verge of that. You bastard. If money is an issue, we'll help you. Government has no shortage of it. Stop it, damn you. Please stop. Stop! It's time. The bar will now be opening. Drinkers, enjoy yourselves, be nice. Troublemakers, kindly leave. We're off. Kohei... That's him. The new boy. I've seen that face before. Definitely seen it before. I can't remember where. Me, neither. Earthly passions fill my mind. Old girlfriends are all I recall. Who on earth is he? Who on earth, indeed? Kohei, thanks for the milk. What's your favorite color? Orange. There he is. Your favorite animal? Dogs. You're in our way. So are you. Walk around us, jerk. Jerk. Kohei, go to hell. How can you say that? What is it? You. Me? Come here. Why? Just get over here. Let's fight. What for? Let's settle it. What is this? Cow shit. What? No way! Hey, wait. Get away from me. Wait. Leave me alone. What are you doing? Don't worry, we're harmless. There's an explanation for this. I'm transmitting. Transmitting? To UFO's. UFO's? Do you believe in them? I've never seen one. Me, neither. It's a question of believing or not. I await a response from the heavens. I am a believer. Please come get me. What are you doing? Run along home. Hello? Excuse me? Are you all right? He's alive. There are many seas on the moon. "Sea of Tranquility" "Sea of Cleverness." "Sea of Fecundity" "Humboldt's Sea" "Smyth's Sea" That's the one we see tonight. Admiral Smyth was my Great-Grandfather. He named that sea. That's the reason I've always felt a longing for that sea on the far-side of the Moon. That's beautiful... Early Crescent Moon How dare you... Damn traitor. Out of my way. Quit it, guys. His dad betrayed the village! I said stop it. They sided with the government... saying we should all leave. Stop it. They took the money. Don't. Kenji, is it true? It's true. Beat me up all you want. We sure will. Stop it, all of you. Stop it for Chris sakes! I wish you'd never come to our village! Stop! I hate just giving up and rolling over. But, you know what? If all my tenant farmers quit I can't keep my fields. Paying the tenants to leave... That sure was a dirty trick. Come harvest-time, what about my daughter's wedding? At this rate no one will be left. Do you mean...? Dad... Why do a thing like that? How could you? Eat. Dad, please stop. It's no big deal if this village disappears. You're always Like that. Always so high and mighty. You're always Like that. That's why Mom left. I hate you. I hate you. Kohei, thanks for the milk. Your life's not easy, either? Talking about my dad? He's got some nerve living among us. It's Indian country. What do you mean? Wherever we go, enemies on all sides. You just get used to it. Is that right... I hate the way my dad works. He never used to be like that. I don't even remember my dad's face. Mom tells me he's probably dead in a ditch somewhere. Oh, so you don't have a dad? Amazing, huh? What is it? My secret base. Come on up here. Great view, huh? A shooting star. I missed it. Did you make a wish? Of course not. What a waste. What are you doing here? This is my place. Says who? I do. What's that? An astronomical telescope. Too bad. What did you just do? This telescope can capture stars. Nonsense. It can. Here's proof. What's this? A meteorite. Huh? A meteorite? Papa got it for me with this telescope. Wow. Can I have a go? Sure. Great. Okay? The second you spot a shooting star, turn the handle. Now. Damn. I'll try again. Can you really catch meteorites? Yes, you can. How come you know that's a real meteorite? Papa wouldn't lie to me, right? Oh, yeah... I get it. You believe me? I'm Ryosuke. That's Kohei. What's your name? Hiharu. Hiharu... Now! Goddamn it... You're useless. Shit. One more time. Akahoshi-kun, let's have some fun... Akahoshi-kun, let's have some fun... Akahoshi-kun, let's have some fun... Akahoshi-kun, let's have some fun... Hey, you old guys, stop it. Aren't you ashamed to be teasing like a bunch of kids? Who are you calling old? Excuse him. He's a new kid. I'm sorry. A new kid? I'll put him straight. I'll let him off because of you. But teach him a lesson, okay? Ouch... What's got into this brat? I'm sorry. Don't worry. They'll just fly home. But they got away? Pigeons are smart. Real smart. Toma said, they come back even from faraway countries. Toma? Toma's amazing. He knows everything. If Toma said it, it must be true. Hang on... Are you Toma, perhaps? I don't think so. Really... Have you been to faraway countries? Has Toma been, I wonder? I've never been. I always wonder what faraway countries are like. This way. What a place... Amazing. Up here. Quick. Look. Wow, they're coming home. Just like I said, right? A lovely sound. Toma always liked it. That flapping sound... That's good. Sure you're not Toma? I really don't think so. Really? Time to feed 'em. Seems that he likes you. Who is Toma, anyway? His younger brother. Everyone says he killed him. Killed him? He loved him so much... too much. He hugged him too hard one time and the boy suffocated and died. Unbelievable. It's just a rumor, though. Well, then... I feel sorry for him. Flying pigeons every day and waiting for Toma to come home. Really... Weird place, right? Better than the city? About a 100 times more interesting. Full of weirdoes. You included. What do you mean? I got something... For you... What is it? Our secret symbol. A symbol of friendship... It's tacky. I don't want it. I'm joking. Give me a break. What's that? Boss! Goddamn it! Who the hell did this? Ryosuke? Kohei? Are you okay? No, I am not! I got these. Thanks. What next? Help Hiharu. Not like that. Thanks. Where do I tie it? Over there. It's ready. Lift it higher. Come on. It's finished. I'm letting them go. Toma, I'm flying. See... He must be dreaming. The stars are so pretty. My Papa loved this place. He used to bring me here all the time. Said he always saw UFO's here. UFO's? Then he can catch us some stars. He's no longer with us. He was taken away by a UFO. That's why I'm always waiting here. It's amazing... Oh, heck... What's up? It's my Mom. Kohei, what are you doing? Kohei, you're up to no good. Come on out. What's this? Kohei! Stay right there. You naughty, stupid boy. Bend over. You really are a fool. I've no pity for you. Is it you? Is that it? Home at last. What's that smell? It's cow. Cow shit. You stupid, stupid, stupid man... At least Let me know you were alive. 2 years breeding kangaroos in Louisiana... 3 years saving Bobo birds from extinction... It was 5 years before I realized. 7 years. You've been gone 7 years. Is it that long? Look at Kohei, grown up into a useless lump. You're Kohei? You're so big I hardly recognize you. Er... no, it's not me. Kohei's THAT one. Of course. That's more Like it. Dad... Yet you didn't recognize me. Whatever. Come here. Dad! You're back. Sumi... Here. A souvenir. What is it? A treasure from an undiscovered tribe in the heart of Africa. They don't have tools to make fire so value flint highly. Before visiting, I stock up on cheap lighters. They love 'em. So is this a fire-starter? No, they use it for circumcision. Circumcision? They cut off boys' foreskins and make 'em into men. Their 150 year old chieftain used it. It'll bring you luck. Look after it. Thank you. Nothing's changed in this village. What was that barricade? Opposition to the airport they're planning to build. Sounds like a long shot. What were you doing all this time? As I said, helping out with the Bobo bird crisis and suchlike. Very meek... they hardly ever mate. The Bobo crisis is one thing, what about our family crisis? Isn't that the Bobo bird from the famous dish, "Banbanji"? Banbanji? You're smart. Yes, it was once made from them. The legendary Bobo, nearly extinct 300 years ago. I created a new species. Why the need to resurrect the Bobo? For the romance... Guys, do you know... bees can't fly. Aeronautically speaking, they are not designed to fly. So how come they can fly? Because they think they can. That's why I pursue the romance of things. Know what I mean... 13th Day of the Moon A moonlit date with you is so romantic. To think that you and I will be married I feel like I got a "lucky strike"! Please, Look around us... The moon, the plants in bloom... it's like they're celebrating our happy future. Sawako-san, have these. Sawako, I love you. Huh? My hat's gone. Go look for it. Wait here... Amazing... I'm going to leave on the Full Moon. Guys... Can I just say one thing? What is it? I want to ask everyone's opinion. Are you against it? Or do you just give in to authority? Me, I'll fight to the end. Think back when we were kids... Finding crawfish, chasing dragonflies... Sipping flower nectar... you remember, right? This place taught me so much. I just think it's time to pay some of that back. If we don't protect this place, who the heck will? I agree. Shin-chan? You're back? Back at last. Hello, mate... I couldn't bear those sweet memories of Michi to be buried under a runway. Who the hell is Michi? Who is it? Professor, you got any ideas? Why not leave it to me? We're all born from the same earth Comrades of the land, are we A scarab spins the earth along the red road Let's yell together to keep sleep at bay The morning sun rises in the West A dragon flies to Eastern skies A scarab spins the earth along the red road Let's sing together 'til morning comes As we have done repeatedly, again we proclaim our unyielding opposition to the airport project. Today's reasoning is based on environmental destruction. Let me invite the locally-born biologist Tsuchida Shinpei to make his address. Tsuchida Shinpei? Thank you for the invitation to speak, I am Tsuchida Shinpei, biologist. I returned today to save the natural assets of my home village. Damn liar... What I am about to say is vitally important to this village. This village is the ancient habitat of a rare breed of animal. Official name: "Japanese Field Mouse" We call them, "Nuskies". Thank you. You're welcome. As a child, I had a friend of great learning. He knew everything about our forests. A veritable expert, was he. One day, he led me exploring deep into the woods. But the weather closed in and a thunderstorm struck. It became treacherous underfoot and mere walking, a task. In no time at all, I lost my footing and fell down the slope. Is this of any relevance? Please listen until the end. On his shoulders, that lad tried to carry me back to the village. Barely a child, his strength limited... yet miraculously, the next day I was back safely in the village. Why do you think that was? He told me himself. A group of Nuskies had guided his way. But back then, nobody believed him. From that day he was dubbed a liar and shunned. Shutting himself off in return, his family left the village. He and I were never reconciled and our friendship died. The Nuskies are a rare animal of global significance. But if the airport is built this important breed will have no home and will become extinct. A loss not just for Japan but for our entire planet. That's right! I didn't help the young boy who saved me. So I became a biologist to gain recognition for the Nuskies. 20 years later, their existence was recognized by science in 1983, as ""Japanese Field Mouse". Proof too, of my continued belief in that young boy. Fine words but haven't farmers hated mice forever? Strange that you now call for their protection. He's right. We live within an endless cycle of animal life. The eternal cat-and-mouse of any ecosystem. I'm talking about this "balance". But men like yourselves, are pushing living things to the edge of extinction. Eventually, nature will exact her revenge. Those who have messed with her must know of what I speak. Right, Mr. Kusunoki? I'm off. The wife kicks up a fuss. She scratched hell out of me. You're lucky to have a cute wife who cares. Sarcasm? Thanks, Michi-chan. See you again. You've aged, Cous-Cous. You too, Shin-chan. You got me in corner. You found the Nuskies. Remember that time we met an old lady by the shrine? She lived up on the hill? She found a nest of them. Is that right? I always knew she was special. Right. Any way we can sort this out? What's going on? How dare you come in here acting high and mighty. Please, no violence. Shut up! The customer is king. You, too, shut up. Toba, quit it! Now he's your best buddy, eh? I thought you were on our side. Whatever... just stop. Get lost... I'll never back down. The minute my back is turned you start this nonsense. During business hours there's no "us" and "them". Just customers who pay to drink. You make your gang obey your rules, right? Yes. Then in my joint you follow my rules. If not, then you stay away. But... Get your "butt" outside. It's no time to joke. You say the government guys mustn't drink in "your" bar... If they don't, you'll pay their slice of my profits? But... Or else drink enough to make up for it. If you haven't got the balls for that keep your mouth shut. That's it for today. Come back when you've learned to drink in peace. Pardon me. Pardon us. Let's go, boys. Good for you, Michi-chan. He was no match for you. Cous-Cous, you remember me? Of course. You still hate the village? I still remember how I didn't stand up for you. No need to drag up the past. I always believed you, Cous-Cous. Near Full Moon Why... how come? Where's Toma? Toma's gone. Why? Why my pigeons? Who did this to them? Obviously an outsider. The man who killed them is the father of the kid you call Toma. Such foolishness. Foolish indeed. You're a friend? Yes. She's fine. Just sedated. Did she really jump off the hill? No, she just slipped over. She's fine. Anything you want to tell her? This is to protect her. Thank you. Such a pretty place. Your friend's dad's okay? They saved his life. Good. Dad... Why did it turn out Like this? I couldn't do anything to help them. Kohei, think hard. If you're a friend, do whatever it takes. That's what friends do. Ryosuke... Is your dad alright? He regained consciousness. Don't worry. I'm glad. What about you? How did it happen? You thought it was suicide? It wasn't that. I was on our hill. Someone had smashed up our place. I was so sad... I looked out over the sky... and it was a fantastic color I'd never seen before... I became so excited... Then this light came towards me... I was so surprised but I knew at once, it was a UFO. So then... I tried to follow it. But you know... it disappeared into the faraway sky. That's when I understood... Papa's not coming back. But I so wanted to believe he would. I really did. You're here, too? When I moved here I thought... maybe it'd be like being reborn. A new place, a new me... Maybe a miracle would happen. Well, I guessed it wouldn't but... I kind of hoped for something. A miracle, huh? I guess Hiharu and I were both waiting for miracles. I know she was... waiting for the chance to change. Let's make a miracle. It won't happen if we just wait. Let's make it happen. Let's make a miracle happen by ourselves. Goddamn. Forgive me. I was so angry. I'm sorry. You're not getting off lightly. We need you to help us. Thanks for coming, everyone. We're declaring war on the grown-ups trying to destroy the village and those grown-ups not able to defend it. So no one must know about this. Our battleground is the wheat field by the construction site. Tomorrow night, during the full moon. We'll save the village ourselves! Got it? The Full Moon Miss Sawako, are you tired? No, I'm fine. That gloomy look won't fit the happy day. Can't be helped, I guess... marrying a guy like that... I'm so sorry. I misspoke. Don't worry. Being born into my family it was just the fate I was dealt. I knew I'd never be free. Miss Sawako, How was it when you married the professor? You'll laugh if I tell you. On our first date, he suddenly started dancing. Dancing? Speaking as a biologist... From dawn until 5pm A weird dance but it made me feel... strangely attracted to him. I just wanted to be with him. Then I couldn't leave his side. Turns out it was the mating dance of the crane. Crazy, huh? He'd never put anything into words, so I proposed to him. A lovely story. Really? I just feel tricked. Even though he left, I was glad I married someone I loved. When I'm with him, that's how I feel. It's best to be with someone you love. That's the key to a woman's happiness. Put on a smile. Sumi-san... For love prevails everywhere, it creates faith and it creates hope, it bears all misfortune, and it never ends. Please, seal your vows with a kiss. Congratulations! Congratulations! But I didn't kiss her yet... Dad... I'm so glad I'm here. Glad I saw where you were born. Ryosuke... I'm sorry. Ryosuke. Sorry I'm late. Is everyone here? You keep look-out. Okay. Kenji, take the gate. Roger. Let's go, boys. It's the police. Toba, I arrest you for the attempted murder of the airport official. It wasn't me. Out of my way! Flatten it. Let's go. But it wasn't me. Boss! She's over here. Forgive me, daughter dear. Naughty daddy. Cheer up. I'm okay, father. Good. Come this way. Everyone, listen please. I'm very thankful for you gathering on my daughter's behalf. Whoever wishes to be next, catch this pretty bouquet. Here we go. Three, two... What? Where did she go? She left. Find Sawako, find her! Kohei, Kohei... What's wrong? The guard's awake. Let's retreat. Wait. Hang on. Huh? What's up, Kohei? My shoe's stuck. What are you doing? Wait. Oh, heck... Hurry up. Is someone out there? Hurry. Kohei... I can't get my shoe out. So what? But my shoe... Incredible. We did it! It's a bit crooked, though... Doesn't matter. Let us through. Sorry it took so long. What's going on? Tell me. Come over here. Here we go. It's amazing. You crazy boys. Just plain crazy. I saw you on TV. Me, too. It's embarrassing. UFO landing on our airstrip... Clairvoyants are saying it's cursed. Thanks to that, I'm out of a job. I wonder who built it. With this much publicity even the government's plans are on hold. Come back again. This is your home. Take care, Shin-chan. Ryosuke, we're off. I got one. See you. See you. Okay... Ryosuke! Welcome, sir. Thank you very much. Do come again. That's him! Sawako-san, Sawako-san... That's him! Goodbye. It's so moving. Really? But in the end, it became an airport? And I came back by plane. Ironic, huh? You really believe that story? Isn't it true? I wonder... Ryosuke. I'm back! Welcome home. See you. Goodbye. Let's go.
