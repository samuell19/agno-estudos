- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes - What is it? - Shh! The door. - It's probably your servant. - She knows I always sleep after lunch. Oh, Paul, I'm frightened. What'll we do? We must have been mad to... Steady. Suppose it's Walter. Has he ever come home this early? - No. - Then why should he today? But suppose he's waiting out there. We'll just have to reason it out. If we're in for it, we are in for it. But I still think it was your servant. Do you feel like having a look? - You mean... go out there? - Yes. Oh, no, I couldn't, I'm petrified. But, darling, we can't stay here all day, you know. I know. Paul, let me in. Nobody, absolutely nobody. It must have been the ama after all. - What we need is a drink. - A whole bottle is what I need. Would you go on down and fix it while I... put together the pieces, hm? I love being with you, Paul. We laugh so much. Walter and I never seem to laugh. - Is that yours? - Yes. - Has it been there all the time. - How stupid of me. I carefully left my car down the hill and then I forgot... - He could have seen it. - Look, darling, he wasn't here. What sort of husband comes home unexpectedly, finds a stranger's briefcase and a locked door and doesn't raise the roof? Walter, please, phone the laboratory and see if he's there. They won't know your voice. Please, darling. What's his number? I... I don't know. Hello, what's the number of the university, please? Thank you. Your husband's number is 24586... better write it down. Hello? Medical School, please. Hello, Medical School? Is Dr. Carwin there? Oh... when? I see. Oh, no, no. No message, thank you. - Not there. Not since lunch. - Oh! Now hold on, don't go jumping to conclusions. But if he was here, what'll we do? I imagine you know better than I how to get round him. Oh, no, no, I don't. I never really got very well acquainted with my husband. I used to think it was because I'm an American... and Englishmen are so reserved, and inhibited and hard to know. But it's not that. Oh, I hate Walter! I shouldn't have come here. We've been so careful up to now. But I got to thinking of you and... I couldn't resist calling and... Well, I did. You'd better go. It does seem a good idea. The bay's probably full of your boats now going round and round in circles... ...burning up all their coal or whatever it is they burn. Brandy, darling, nothing but brandy. They are French boats. - Goodbye, Paul. - Goodbye. Where did you come from? Where did you get these? Dr. Carwin left them for you after - - -. Thank you. Good evening, Walter. Um... after lunch? Napping, of course. I always nap after lunch. Briefcase? I... ...can't imagine. Oh... I suppose it was the real estate agent. He was here, something about a bigger house that's going to be... Do you realize what you're saying? If that's what you thought, why didn't you knock? Walter, I'll certainly not be cross-examined this way. - Good evening, Walter. - Good evening. Uh... you're late. I think it's the usual time. You didn't toot your horn. I must have forgotten. Oh, um... we're due at the Nevilles later on, you know. I know. I hope they won't remember this dress. I don't think so. I'll change now before dinner... this time. This time? The last of that equipment finally arrived from the United States. What is it? Nothing. That's very nice. The equipment for the laboratory, you know. Yes, I know. Very nice. Not bad for government requisition. I ordered it when I was in New York. Only two years ago. That was about the time we met, wasn't it? Yes, it was. Shall we have our coffee in the other room? I'm sorry, you haven't finished. That's quite all right. Shouldn't we be going? Isn't it rather early? I forgot to thank you for bringing the books this afternoon. I was asleep, I didn't hear you. You had the blinds shut. Don't you like your mystery story? Yes, why? You haven't turned a page. I think I've read it before. - They're all alike anyway. - Why do you read them? To pass the time, I suppose. Shouldn't think you'd find that a problem. It really is getting late, we must go. - Good night, Lee. - Good night. I hate coming here like this, always being invited after dinner. It's just a matter of protocol. You know very well, bacteriologists are in the after-dinner group. Of course if our host were suffering from some rare tropical disease, we might make the dinner table. Very funny. - Good evening, sir. - Hello, Carwin. - You know my wife? - Why, of course. - Good evening. - Of course. Come in. Why, I don't know where Mrs. Neville is. Well, she may be through there. - Excuse me, sir. - Yes? - Governor on the phone. - Oh. - Um... - Never mind, we'll find her. - Well, make yourselves at home, will you? - Thank you. - Thank you. - Excuse me. - Good evening, Carwin. - Good evening. Oh, Walter, would you see if you could find me a lime and water? Certainly. Good evening. All must be very serious now. I at last have a hand. Two diamonds. - Good evening. - Hello. - Oh, hello, Carol how nice to see you. - Hello, Dorothy. - I pass. - You brought me luck. Two hearts. How are you, Carol? - Fine, thanks. Do you mind if I watch? - Not at all. - I pass. - Now, let me see. It's funny, I... I've just been reading a new mystery novel that begins with a bridge game. My husband brought it this afternoon. - Four clubs. - Pass. Well, darling? Sorry, dear... four diamonds. Typical of my darling husband. You were telling us about the book your husband brought you. Oh, I mustn't interrupt your game. - Pass. - I pass. - Pass. - You're the dummy, Paul, do get Carol a chair. Oh, no, never mind, if you're going for a slam, I might make you nervous. Can I get anyone a drink? Do shut up, darling, I'm concentrating. Good luck to you. - He knows. - Because he brought a book? He knows. - What did he say? - Nothing. I've got to see you tomorrow. That will be difficult, there's a ship from... The usual place and time. They tell me the new territories are simply flooded with refugees. Oh, it is not as bad as all that. There are problems of course on the border... - Nice to see you, doctor. - Good evening. You did want lime and water, didn't you? Thank you. I think I could do with something myself, but rather stronger. - Excuse me. - Certainly. Don't you want your drink? Oh, I think I see Mrs. Neville. Oh, thank goodness you're here. I was afraid you might not make it. What's happened, darling, you're trembling. I know, I didn't sleep a wink all night. I'm all right now. When you hold me, I'm all right. Come in. Never mind, I'll do that, thank you. Yes, Miss. Now, tell me what's wrong. - Has Walter said anything? - No. - Well, then... - But he knows, Paul. He slept in the study last night. Oh, he's done that before when I ask him to, but this time I didn't have to ask. And the way he looks, the way he acts. We've got to decide what to do. As long as he does nothing. But that's what's so awful, Paul. I wish he would do something. I can't stand just waiting, and wondering what's in his mind. I can't take it any longer, it's not human, he's not human! Don't let it upset you like this, after all he hasn't accused you. Maybe he doesn't know. - Or maybe he's going to ignore it. - Walter's not like that. Has he ever been jealous before? You're a very lovely woman. No, he has always trusted me. I suppose I should feel guilty, but I don't. Why should you? Because we fell in love? Funny thing falling in love. You're so sure what's happening to you never happened to anybody else in the world. Then suddenly you realize what you're in for. Does that mean you want to call it off? Oh, of course not. It means I want it to go on forever. I wish you belonged to me. I wish we were married. Oh, darling. Whatever happens, you can count on me. You didn't need to say that. But I'm glad you did. Carol. Yes. Did I waken you? As a matter of fact you did. - Is... is something wrong? - No, why? It isn't like you to leave the laboratory at this hour. I want to talk to you. Will you come to my study? Very well. It doesn't matter how you look. Have you ever heard of Mai Tan Fu? - Of what? - Mai Tan Fu. There's a cholera epidemic there. Vaguely. It's been in all the papers. Things are pretty bad. There was a medical missionary there, but he died. I volunteered to go and take charge. You? Is that necessary? Well, there isn't a foreign doctor in the place. But you're not a doctor, you're a bacteriologist. In case you've forgotten, I'm an MD as well as a bacteriologist. Besides, I've been doing a lot of work with a sort of derivatives. - This will be our practical opportunity to... - Isn't it awfully dangerous? Awfully, but it's minimized if you're properly inocculated. I don't understand why you're going, it's not your responsibility. There must be others. Besides, something might happen to you. Your concern is very touching. Where is this place? Three hundred miles southwest of here on the mouth of the Sichuan river. We leave tomorrow. Who is we? You and I. Are you expecting me to come too? I thought you'd like to. Well, I wouldn't. I'm no heroic little doctor's woman... ...who wraps a towel around her head and empties bedpans. What good could I possibly do? You might cheer and comfort me. After all, your place is by my side, for better or worse, in sickness and in health till death do us part. Oh, I get it. This is your way of punishing me. Well, it won't work. I am not going with you and you can't force me to go. There's nothing you can do about it, Walter, and that's final! Just a moment! You're quite right, I can't force you. But if you won't go, neither will I. I'll stay here, I'll file suit for divorce. And I'll cite Duvel with all possible notoriety. I'm glad it's out in the open. Our marriage was wrong from the start and I'm thankful it's finished. But I do think we could be civilized about it. Why can't you let me divorce you, quietly, with as little fuss as possible? Fuss no doubt would be bad for Duvel. It would also be unpleasant for you and me. Do you expect me to show any consideration for you and Duvel? I at least thought you were a gentleman. Apparently you were wrong about that too. I was a fool to marry you, I don't know why I did. - I suppose I deserve this. - Don't be too hard on yourself. You were desperate at the time. - Desperate? - I don't mean biologically. You were desperate to get a husband. Does it surprise you that I know? I'm considered quite good at diagnoses and the symptoms were really pretty clear. All your life you've been told how beautiful you were, what a wonderful marriage you'd make. You were quite vain about it. You turned down all sorts of men... ...because they weren't good enough for you. And suddenly, your younger sister, the ugly one, announced her engagement. You couldn't take it. So you grabbed the first half-presentable man that came along, me! I was dull, and unromantic, but I was a doctor. And that counts for something in Baltimore. And I was British. And that counts for something in certain sections of Baltimore too. But best of all a was on my way to Hong Kong, which provided you with an escape. - If that's what you thought, why didn't... - It's true, isn't it? It's close enough. If you knew this why did you marry me? Because I loved you. I knew you were shallow, and frivolous and vane, but I loved you. I knew your sense of humor was cheap, and the people you enjoyed second rate, but I loved you. I loved you so much... ...what most husbands expect as a right, I was prepared to receive as a favor. And I would have gone on like that forever. If only you hadn't degraded me. You degraded yourself. In spite of everything you say, I never would have married you if I hadn't thought I could respect you. But you made yourself a doormat. You have the nerve to talk about my vanity. You flattered my vanity, and you laughed at my cheap humor... ...and you pretended I had qualities which apparently I haven't. And you came to me like a beggar. You let me use the tired gag, the headache gag, all the gags. How did you expect me to feel anything but contempt for you? Do you know that I find you physically repulsive? No, Walter, when you give out the blame, you'll have to take a little of it yourself. If you knew half as much about handling a woman... ...as you about your bacteria and your viruses, this never would have happened. You talk about love! You don't know the first thing about it! - Duvel does, evidently! - Yes, he does! If it weren't for him, I wouldn't know what love is. I might have gone through life without knowing. Thinking something was wrong with me. I wonder how many women do. Are you sure enough of this great passion to put it to the test? What test? I'll let you divorce me quietly and without fuss... if Duvel will ask his wife to divorce him... ...and he will promise to marry you within a week after both divorces are final. - Do you really mean that? - I really mean it. I give you my word... as a gentleman. I'm very grateful to you, Walter, I'll never stop being grateful. What are you laughing at? I beg your pardon? I dare say my sense of humor is peculiar. You are a fool. There are thirty cars in the haul. We'll take them off in lighters. - Has she passed Neilingding Island? - Yes, sir. - She will be in Kowloon Bay in one hour. - Good. She's going to buoy A-1. Very well, the other cargo list is out here. The list, please. I'll call you as soon as I've talked to the harbor master. Very well, sir. Hello, Carol. Excuse me. - How are you? - I've got to talk to you. Please come in. You must pardon my surprise, but I didn't expect to see you. I'm very impressed, your offices are beautiful. Oh... I only use them for reading. I like them, they make you look distinguished. - Do they? - Yes. I'm embarrassing you, I'm sorry. Not at all, it's just that I was surprised at your coming here. I wouldn't have ordinarily, but... Paul. - Yes? - Walter is going to let me divorce him. Excuse me. Yes? Yes, put him through. Yes, hm-hm... I've told them. Yes, we'll take them off after she's cleared the immigration. No, I can't. Have you ever tried to hurry immigration? Now. Things are moving a little fast for me. - You were saying. - That Walter will let me divorce him if... If? Now I'm embarrassed. You needn't be. If Dorothy will divorce you... ...and you'll promise to marry me a week after both divorces are final. Otherwise, he'll sue and name you and stir up as much dirt as possible. Your husband has quite a talent for being unpleasant. I'd understand if he tore the house down. Or punched me on the nose, or anything. But this? No wonder he kept quiet so long figuring it out. Don't you want a divorce? There's a big difference between what I want and what I can have. Do you mean that Dorothy won't... But you gave me the impression you two meant nothing to each other. I said we weren't in love. Not quite the same thing. She keeps the franchise, is that it? Carol, if I gave you the impression that I have no regard for her, then I misled you. I have the greatest regard for her. As a person, as a friend. We haven't been in love for a long time. But that doesn't give me the right to walk out on her. Do you mind if I sit down, Paul? - When you hit, you hit awfully hard. - Carol! If this is the way you feel, don't you think you should have stayed away from me? Would you want me to stay away? Wasn't this mutual? Yes, it was. But you needn't have said you wished we were married. I meant it. I still mean it. If ever two people should have been, we should. Unfortunately we met too late. I see. Thanks for spelling it out for me. You don't understand. Oh, yes, I do, I understand very well. The whole thing was a sales campaign to get me to the teahouse. Please! Suppose I had the courage to walk out on Dorothy. And I would, rather than lose you. I can't walk out on my children. I'm sorry, Paul, I'm afraid it's a little late for me... ...to appreciate your parental feelings. Carol, I know you won't believe I have any concern for you. But for your sake as well as mine, we've got to agree on how to stop Walter. Oh, don't worry, there's a way out for you. Walter's going to Mai Tan Phu. There's a cholera epidemic. He's taking charge, if I leave you and go with him, he won't sue. But that's unthinkable. Have you anything else to suggest? - Yes? - You're due at the docks in ten minutes. Yes, I'll be there. - Carol... - Please, Paul, no more sales talk. I believed you last time, I bought everything you offered. Don't ask me to buy anything else, not now. - Walter. - Yes? - I'm coming with you. - Good. - When do we leave? - Tomorrow morning at ten. I don't suppose I need pack more than a few summer things and... ...a shroud. I've already told your ama to pack for you. You were pretty sure he'd let me down, weren't you? I suggest you dress in something rather sensible for the journey. I'll dress in exactly what I please. You knew what he'd do all right. Because one thing I don't think you do know. I still love him. That's something you can't kill. - Good morning, Doctor. - Good morning. This is my wife. Dr. Ling. - How do you do? - Hello, Doctor. Don't worry about your husband, we'll take very good care of him. Mrs. Carwin is coming with us, Doctor. I've never been invited to an epidemic before. I hope it'll be fun. Has Mrs. Carwin been inocculated, sir? Do you think I'm trying to kill my wife, Doctor? Oh, of course not. I think we're just about ready to leave. Good. Carol, shall we go aboard? ( in dialect ) I don't know this dialect, Dr. Ling. The elder thanks you for your humanity in coming here. But he said they do not need your help, they can deal with the epidemic as they always have. Now, Col. Yu, Military Commander, said the epidemic is very bad and you are needed desperately. The colonel has given the necessary order... ...and those who do not cooperate will be punished. Let's go, Dr. Ling. ( In Chinese ) ( in dialect ) It's a steep climb up the hill, but Col. Yu has provided Mrs. Carwin with a chair. Would you please thank the colonel for me? ( in dialect ) Well, I hope it has automatic transmission. We're staying outside the town, in that house on the top there. Watson, the missionary, had it. They say it's quite comfortable. I'll follow you as soon as I've sorted things out with Dr. Ling. With your permission, Doctor, I'll go ahead with the colonel. I dispensary has been cleared for you on the island... - ...near his headquarters. - Good. I'll take your equipment there so we can begin work in the morning. Thank you very much, Dr. Ling. Hello. I'm Mrs. Carwin. The doctor's wife. Well, carry on. It's been spoken for. I know, dear girl. I'm Tim Waddington. A rather a lumpy name, but there it is. Oh. I just had a word with your husband. I wanted to meet you down below, but... ...I thought it was more important to see that the house was ready. Duvel's wire didn't get here until this afternoon. - Paul Duvel? - Yes, I knew him centuries ago, he... ...asked me to look out for you and give you a hand. How nice. I hadn't any idea that the job was going to be so pleasant. I brought you a bottle os scotch as a sort of housewarming gift. And I don't mind telling you that if I'd known what you were going to look like, I' would have brought you a case. Drink? No, thank you. As I was telling the good doctor, I took the liberty... ...of ordering your dinner for tonight, I thought you'd probably be done in. Thank you. I also invited myself to dinner. Hm, glad to have you. - Cook's not bad, you know. - Does he speak any English? Un poco, poco. Oh, I'm wildly international. He was Watson's number one boy. - The missionary? - Hm-hmm. Nice chap. Ghastly idea of decor. Absolute mania for halos and parks. ( in Chinese ) - Are those the bedrooms? - Yes. This was Mrs. Watson's room. Nice bed. Of course I don't speak from experience. And this, um... This one is somewhat less grand scale. It will do. ( in Chinese ) I... I'm afraid there's only one bathroom. Well, if there's an emergency, perhaps we can run over and use yours. Oh, of course. You'll find it quite a run, though. I live on the island. If you'll excuse me, I'd like to change. There's a door to the bathroom on the left. And don't drink the water. Um, can I mix you a drink, Doctor? Thank you. This job should get you a medal if it doesn't kill you. They're supposed to have cholera under control these days. It doesn't seem like it, does it? No. They're dying off like fish on a beach. Conditions are quite chaotic. Colonel Yu tried to get the nuns to leave, but they've turned the convent into a hospital. They all want to be martyrs, or saints or something. Which is it? Why haven't you gone? Well, I've lived here so long there's really no place for me to go. Besides, I work here in a sort of way, I... I export odds and import ends. - Have you been inocculated? - Hm-hmm. Watson made me. - Another drink? - I haven't quite finished this one. Oh, well, one mustn't dawdle. Can't waste valuable drinking time, you know. I say! I do like a well-groomed woman. What is that, Rue de L'Arp?ge? Clearance sale, Hong Kong. Shall we have dinner? You can't imagine how I'm looking forward to it. There's no head to this sort of table, you just sit wherever you like. You know, missionaries always buy huge dining tables. They get so much a year for every child they have and... they buy their tables when they marry... ...so there'll be plenty of room for the little strangers. Of course Watson never really got a chance to get started. Chu Chan! Well, you must have brought a lot of gossip with you. Who's scrambling with whose wife and after what job? You must forgive me if I talk too much, but I haven't had a chance to yabble with anybody except for nuns... ...and there's a distinct limit to the number of topics one can discuss with a nun. I didn't order that. Dear girl, you can't eat salad. Uncooked greens are dangerous at any time, but now it's practically sure death, isn't that right, Doctor? Yes. I thought that was the general idea. My wife likes salad. So do I. ( in dialect ) I say. What's going on between you two, I know it's very bad form to ask, but... what is this, a suicide pact? Don't be so melodramatic, Mr. Waddington, after all, we've both been inocculated. Yes... well, Watson was inocculated. I'll show you his grave tomorrow. How sweet of you. Perhaps the next day we could look around the morgue. Well, I hope you don't go there as customers. Don't you ever wait until you're asked to have a drink? You wouldn't be so testy if you drank more yourself. You should, you know. Keeps the cholera out. You want me to get out, Carol? No. I'd have gone stark raving mad if it weren't for you, Tim. Oh, about the radio you brought me, thanks, thanks a lot. Well, I'm noted for my generosity. And it's purely coincidental that all of my beneficiaries are beautiful young women. There was a girl in Saigon to whom I gave a hot plate. I say, you must cheer up. You'll be in Hong Kong before you know it. Only sixty-seven people died yesterday. That, um... husband of yours is doing a magnificent job. They call him the needle man. He's jabbing his way forward every day. It's quite a marvel, I've never seen such a dedicated man. He won't let anything stop him, not even a wound. Wound? Yes, dear girl. You know... second day. One of the local citizens objected to having his child inocculated... ...and took after Walter with a knife. It was only a scratch, of course. Oh, that. It didn't amount to anything, really. I can understand how this place gets on your nerves. It was pretty grim before the cholera. You know, sometimes I think... that I should have lived a more conventional life and got on, like, um... Paul Duvel. Did you know him very well? Yes, at one time, when we came out to China together. For a while we were very buddy buddy around Hong Kong, then I continued to rove and Paul settled down to his career and his, um... ladies. Aren't you punching a little low? Oh, I don't think so. Some men need a lot of women. Probably their metabolism or... ...too much vitamin E, or something, I don't know. - Very funny. - Oh, he's a good fellow, really. Oddly enough devoted to his wife. He never lets these little romances interfere with his nerves. I'm just about fed up with your gossip and your nasty cracks. You're not bored anymore, are you? So it is Paul Duvel. I thought so much, but I wasn't absolutely sure until this moment. Of course the day you arrived, I knew that you and your husband were sitting it out. Separate rooms, and that schoolgirl gesture with the salad. And you certainly don't have a very current knowledge of your husband's anatomy. You didn't even know that he was wounded. I think you'd better just shut up! You go about like Camille on her deathbed. The only thing that lights up those beautiful eyes of yours... ...is the mention of dreamboy. Get out! I mean it! Get out and don't come back! I say, dear girl, I have nettled you, haven't I? Well, in the circumstances, I think I'll be toddling along. Tim! Tim, wait! Wait. I, um... I'm sorry I blew my top. You are such a terrible snoop, you know. Yes, it's an ugly trait, but I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it. Friends? To the death. Well... now that we're going steady again, do you want to do me a favor? If I can. Come for a walk with me tomorrow afternoon. - Where? - Here and there. I promise you won't be bored. All right. - Oh... good evening. - Good evening. I say, old man, you look done in. What's the matter, needle getting heavy? - I'm all right. - Well, you'd better fix yourself a drink. - Will you have one? - No, thanks, I'm just leaving. It's curious, I wonder what he's really like. I'm the wrong one to ask. Well, I'll pick you up after lunch tomorrow. All right, Tim. You, um... didn't tell me you'd been stabbed. I didn't think you'd be interested. There's been a death in this house. All those paper toys are for the deceased to take to heaven. Obviously, in this case you've got a lot of people rooting for him. With all that stuff he should be pretty comfortable upstairs. There must be quite a boom in the paper business these days. Or do they use the same toys over and over again? No, they burn them at the funeral. In the end it all goes up in smoke. Well, it's a childish custom. We all have to have toys to comfort us. Some people have prayer wheels, I have my... bottles. And you, dear girl, should really try to find some toys to keep you out of mischief. Are we going any place in particular? Very particular. And now, there's something a little more cheerful. A wedding anniversary. They've been married twenty-five years. Nice going. When they get married, they stay married. Another childish custom. - Tim. - Yes? Have you ever been married? Oh, I've been every day. How does one end up with lots of flowers on the front of the house, Tim? Oh, one just trudges along not expecting too much. Oh! Cholera? Yes. Now, steady. Feel up to going on? I'll be all right. Let's go. I've never seen a dead man before. You're going to have to get used to it. It's dreadful. Makes everything else seem so horribly trivial. He didn't look human. Now, there's your husband's dispensary. Want to take a look. - No, thanks. - But it's quite a sight, you know. There he is, in the midst of it, risking death all day long, jabbing away with his needle. They think that he's a hero. You don't, apparently. Watson was a hero, he loved the Chinese. But I don't think that your husband came here out of passion. And until I find out why he came here, I'm not prepared to call him a hero. Now I get it! The convent! Right. Why didn't you tell me what you were up to? - Because I didn't think you'd come. - You're quite right. I don't behave very well with people who think they know all the answers. But the nuns aren't like that at all. They're very, very decent. Of course they're a little bit unworthy, but they'll give you a shirt off their backs, or whatever it is they wear. You know, they're a little bit hurt because you haven't been to see them. Why, Tim. Sentimental you? Well, it really would save my face if you paid them a courtesy call. All right. Well, I don't want to give them the wrong impression. - Bon jour, Monsieur Waddington. - Hello, love boat. Madame Carwin, Sister Saint Joseph. Bon jour, Madame Carwin. Oh... come in! If only I'd known you were coming. Oh, ma foi, I have forgotten to make some tea cakes today. That's just as well, the last time I tried one, I broke a tooth. Is he not outrageous, Mrs. Carwin? The things he says. It was a long time before I realized he is only a teaser. Please come this way. He does have certain a repulsive charm. It has been very difficult this week. Until monsieur le docteur he comes, why, we could do nothing except try to make death a little easier. ( in dialect ) Our orphans. We try to keep them in the fresh air as much as possible. If you will please to wait in here, I will summon the Reverend Mother. Thank you. I, um... never met a Mother Superior before. - What do I call her? - Well, Mother is quite appropriate. There are times, of course, when I'm tempted to call her something less complimentary. - I thought you too were so clubby. - Oh, I like her enormously. But I'd like to know why I like her. No matter how hard I try, I cannot get he to talk about herself. And I hate people keeping secrets from me. - Perhaps there's no secret. - There's always a secret. I hope nothing happens to her before I find out what it is. You know that this epidemic has practically done her in? Two nuns died last week. They're desperately short-handed. - Short-handed? - Desperately. Not enough shoulders to put to the wheel. Oh... courtesy call. I'm supposed to sign on as a helping hand, is that it? Maybe it would be good for you. A lot better than listening to the radio all day and dreaming of Hong Kong Harry. Well, if they're so short-handed, why don't you roll up your sleeves, hm? Me? Dear girl, a nunnery is hardly the place for a man of my character. My character is just as bad as yours. If you think I have any intention... Madame Carwin, how nice to meet you at last. I hope I haven't come at a time that's inconvenient for you. Oh, please, sit down, it is a privilege to meet the wife of Dr. Carwin. Please sit down, Mr. Waddington. Ah, ch?re madame, your husband has not spared himself during this dreadful epidemic. We will never cease being grateful. You must take good care of the doctor, and not let him work too hard for all our sakes. Ah, I hope you like tea in the Chinese fashion. I do... but you shouldn't have bothered. And some teacakes I have found. We who are about to die salute you. I know Mr. Waddington would prefer whiskey, but that I cannot offer. Oh, you shouldn't have said that, ma m?re. Mme. Carwin does not know that I drink. We make allowances for M. Waddington, we are under obligation to him. Several times when we did not have enough to eat, he has come to our rescue. A sinner trying to buy his way into heaven. You're a good sinner. Often he has given us money when we had no cash left to buy babies. Buy? Did you not know we buy our babies? Oh, come, I would like to show you something. You will excuse us. Aren't they lovely? Most of them are orphans only in the sense that their parents do not want them. The girls would be abandoned or destroyed if we didn't offer money for them. Oh, don't cry, darling. Oh, but you must see our best. She was brought in several days ago more dead than alive. We despaired of her life, but your husband saved her. It's almost as if she lived to please him. He has an instinct for handling children. Most men are awkward with them. My husband's been holding out on me. - Holding out? - I didn't know he was a frustrated parent. I mean, I have never actually seen him with children, we have none of out own. What a pity. Perhaps it's a blessing. I'm sorry, I... I didn't realize I was quite so terrifying. Oh, it's only that you're strange. If you'll excuse me, I'll take her to the sister. What's the matter, darling? Now stop, I will not... The Mother Superior is busy helping one of the children. They have so much to do, I think we really should go. Of course. Would you say goodbye to the Reverend Mother for us? Yes, madame. Thank you. Goodbye, Madame Carwin. Goodbye. Walter. Hello... don't you want some light? Oh, I suppose so. I, um... I went to the convent today. Well, you might say, "Oh, did you?" or "How interesting". It didn't strike me that any of those comments would have been very enlightening. If people didn't speak unless they had something enlightening to say, they wouldn't speak very often, I'm afraid. A cynical observation. It leads to what interest? Mine. As a matter of fact I knew you had been to the convent, they told me when I made my rounds. I don't suppose it was a very enthusiastic report. I didn't score, but... you certainly have. I think you're a combination of Louis Pasteur and Santa Claus. You're the top in their book, that's pretty high. They're prejudiced in favor of my profession. Oh, um... I... I sent the boy to bed. I made you some sandwiches... ...if you want them. Without lettuce. Thank you. It's, um... been rough, hasn't it? Rough passage. Oh, well, it will soon be over one way or another. You know, today when the nun spoke so highly of you, it was... ...kind of funny, I... felt proud. I, um... also felt embarrassed. They took it for granted I was on your team, that plucky little Carwin woman, you know. Walter, we've hardly spoken to each other since we've been here. This isn't easy, but I'd like to speak to you about everything. I'm not going to pretend I'm sorry about what I did, I... I guess there's something lacking in me, I don't suppose I'm really very moral. Must we go into these reminiscences, I'm not asking you to... Walter, please listen to me. Perhaps I was silly, or stupid, or wicked. I just don't know, but it happened. And if anything's wrong with this all around... ...is for you to go on suffering because of a silly woman's infidelity. It seems a long time ago. And I want you to know there's one thing I am sorry about, I... I'm sorry I hurt you. I guess I'm making a pretty bad job of this, but... It seems we're stuck with each other... at least for the present, so why can't we make the best of it? I don't expect you to give me a good conduct medal, but... Instead of snarling and glaring and hating, couldn't we at least be friends? I didn't marry you because I wanted a friend! Walter! Walter, why did you force me to come here with you? Because I couldn't leave you there with him! Because the vision of you two wallowing in your great passion was too much for me. I decided to take you away from him even if it meant killing you. You despise me, don't you? - I despise myself! - For marrying me? For loving you! Walter! If we ever get through all this, I don't know if we'll still go on together or if you'll want too separate, But if you want to try, maybe we have a fighting chance. - It would help if you could forgive me. - What's the good of that, words. I only know we haven't a chance until you can say you forgive me and mean it. How can I? Unless I'm born again without a memory. Oh, Walter, I can't stand this much longer. And how long do you think I can stand it? Living with you, seeing you, needing you and not touching you. Don't... don't, you can't. You can't love me and hate me at the same time. Walter, don't! Oh, don't... ( in dialect ) I'm going out. No lunch. Madame Carwin. Oh, Reverend Mother. I know you're very busy, but... may I talk to you, please? Certainly. - Bon jour, madame. - Good afternoon. Did you come here alone? Yes. It's unsafe to walk through the town alone, you should always have someone with you. Oh... I didn't think. It's one of my troubles, I suppose. When I want to do something, I do it, then think about it later. Reverend Mother, I've been told you needed help. I want to come here and work. That's very kind, but... I have nothing to do all day long, I'm tired of being idle. I don't care what kind of work I do. Does your husband want you to work here? I haven't spoken to him about it. He may not wish you to expose yourself so directly. I don't think that will worry him. I mean, he's so busy himself and he knows I have nothing to do. I do wish you'd let me come, it matters a great deal to me. I do not wish to be rude, Madame Carwin. But if you want to come here as an escape from some personal problem, it is better that you do not bother. You would not help yourself or us. Then you don't need help. We do very badly. But you are not a trained nurse, you do not speak Chinese. I see. If my husband wants me to, will you let me? If the doctor makes such a request, I could not refuse him. Thank you. Madame Carwin. You know, one cannot find peace in work or in pleasure... ...in the world or in a convent. But only in oneself. Turn her face the other way. Now look, don't worry, this isn't going to hurt. This isn't going to hurt you. That's right, it's just a little scratch. That's all right, now. There, you see? ( in Chinese ) - ( in Chinese ) - Walter. May I speak with you for a moment, please? You shouldn't have come here. Walter. They all think you're a fine man. Fine men have fine marriages. Pretend a little. Doctor, will you excuse me a moment? I'm sorry to bother you now, I... I hate to interrupt, but... What is it? I want to go to work at the convent. I don't think they want me, but I'd like to very much. It's important to me, Walter. And if you ask them, they'll let me. Why is it important to you? Well, is it so strange? I want something to do. You won't find it pleasant. I didn't say I expected it to be. I'm not afraid of cholera. Look, I must go back. We'll talk about it later. Walter. Walter, please do this for me. Say you'll speak to the Mother Superior. All right, I'll speak to her. Thank you, Walter. Thank you. Well... oh, now. Let's get on with my lesson. What is the word for... this? Stai tsam chu. Oh... stai... tsam... chu. Oh, it's very difficult. Now, um... what's this? This, hm? Mo kum. Oh... Mo kum. Hm? - Tsai pon ko pun. - Oh, dear. Tsai pon ko pun. Hello, Tim. I have never heard Chinese so exquisitely spoken. Oh, nothing really. How are you? Un poco, poco... I thought I'd take you to tea at my place. Oh... do you have a place? I thought you must live in a web somewhere. Thanks, but I can't today. I'm not nearly finished. Oh, Madame Carwin, let me finish for you. She has been working too hard for one who is not accostumed to work. Oh, no, you have enough to do yourself, I'll finish. Well, I have nothing to do, so I'll wait. ( in dialect ) One thing I will say for her. She has a willing spirit. I like willing women. Well, here we are. You're a surprising fellow, Tim. Nice of you to say so. Excuse me. Come in. Carol, this is my wife. How do you do? Please pardon me for staring, but Tim didn't tell me about you. She speaks no English. ( in Chinese ) ( in Chinese ) She bids you welcome. Why didn't you tell me about her? I wasn't sure that you'd aprove. What you mean is you weren't sure she'd approve. Perhaps. Oh, Tim, tell her I think she's the most exquisite thing I've ever seen. Well, if you don't mind I think I'll tone that down a bit, I don't want her getting a swolen head. ( in Chinese ) ( in Chinese ) She thanks you for your gracious words... ...and wants to know how old you are and how many children you have. I've already answered both questions. ( in Chinese ) She wants us to sit down. Thank you. You've been married a long time? We've known each other for quite a long time. We met some years ago in Peking. She belongs to what once was the imperial family. Splendid people. Of course they were absolutely horrified at the idea of me. I wonder what she sees in you. Yes, I've often wondered that myself. I've treated her very shabbily. I ran away from her several times. She always found me. Why did you stop running? The last time she found me I just knew that if I ever left her again... ...she'd commit suicide. Not for any ill feelings towards me, but... ...simply and naturally because she couldn't live without me. In the circumstances, I stopped playing hide and seek. No, thank you. I wish I could talk to her in her own language. There's so much I'd like to ask her. She seems so wise. Yes, I don't think one really learns from another's experience. What lovely hands she has. ( in Chinese ) She thinks you're admiring her bracelet, she's giving it to you. - Oh, no, I couldn't... - She'd be very offended if you didn't. Thank you. I'm afraid they won't fit. ( in Chinese ) She's going to get you something else. You didn't say you had a great affection for her. Oh, what makes you think I have? I see it in your eyes. - You're happy, aren't you, Tim? - Un poco, poco. I thought loving was the important thing rather than being loved. Sometimes we don't even like the people who love us. But you do love her, it's true, isn't it? Well, you know, can hardly be... ...up to your neck in this stuff day and night without some of it rubbing off on you. When you kept leaving, you must have hurt her terribly. How did you make it up to her? By staying with her and letting her look after me. Oh, it's impossible for a western woman to understand such devotion. You are emancipated and equal and I think terribly unhappy. ( in Chinese ) She hopes you can wear these, they make ideal bedroom slippers. Oh, they're lovely! Oh, they fit me perfectly. What is it, are they too big for her? Miles. You are proud of her, aren't you? Funny, I thought I knew you. Now I feel I don't know the first thing about you. Hey, hey! ( in Chinese ) Hey, hey. ( in Chinese ) Reverend Mother! - Is it cholera? - Shh! Lee! Wan! Let us try to mover her. Carry her to the parlor. Careful! Careful! My ch?re enfant, it is something good that has happened to you, not something bad. One should be happy at a time like this. One should be, I suppose. I do not know why you are unhappy. But one's personal desires are as nothing before the fact of a new life. You will work no more today. Tomorrow if you wish you may continue your duties, but now you must go home and rest. I'll get someone to walk with you. Thank you. When I made my rounds they told me you were ill. Did they tell you what was wrong? No. But they said it was nothing alarming. I came along anyway to have a look. You needn't have bothered, I'm all right now. Oh, don't, I don't want the light. There's nothing wrong. Chinese women have them by the dozen right in the fields and then go on working. I'm sorry, Walter. A husband is supposed to come home and find his wife knitting little things. And a wife is supposed to be able to tell her husband that he's the father. It could be yours or... ...it could be his. It might have been better if you'd lied. Then everything would have been all right. I wish you'd lied. It's too bad I found out about being honest when it's too late to do any good. Well, I'll make arrangements for you to go back. You know it'll take a couple of days. I don't want to leave, unless you insist. I don't think you should stay here now. I have no place to go, Walter. I certainly don't want to go back to Hong Kong. It's funny, this is the first time I ever felt like I had a home. You'd better lie down. I'll give you a sedative. The boiled water is in the jar. Thank you. You look so tired, Walter. So terribly tired. It's strange, I... I thought a sunburn was supposed to make you look healthy. I'm glad you told me. Of course I knew you didn't like me. I do not dislike anyone. But you don't exactly approve of me. I know you and your husband are unhappy. It is a wife's duty to make her husband happy. I've made such a mess of things. I thought maybe you could help me, tell me what to do. You have already taken the first step. Only when we are conscious of where we've failed do we begin to see our way. What way? I'm lost... I don't know where to turn to. You will find your way now. You do not think I know what I am talking about. How could you? You've lived a sheltered life. Oh, I know it's been hard, but... ...your experiences have always been good. You don't know about people like me. You've always lived for others, sacrificed. I've sacrified nothing. I thought I did. When I first took holy vows, I felt quite sorry for myself. You see, I too have lived in the world, I too have searched and taken the wrong way, I have made the mistakes you think I know nothing about and... ...felt the sting of the world's disapproval. But when I finally gave up the world, I gave up what I no longer wanted. It was only when I realized that it was selfishness that brought me to the cloister... ...that I saw myself as I really was, and then for the first time, I began to find my way... ...as you must find yours. With Walter? He's a good man. You have not yet discovered him. Come here, my child. This too I did not approve of you, but it's no longer true. You must hope that in time your husband will realize... ...that in the real sense he is the father of your child. That his ideals, his qualities, will shape its future... ...just as they are shaped in yours. And that he will forget... and forgive. Who... who is it, who's there? Madam Carwin! Madam Carwin! Oh, um... yes? ( in Chinese ) I'm sorry, I don't understand Chinese. What is it? - You come. - Well, can't you tell me what's wrong? Come, you come, quick! Quick! Tim, what is it? Walter, cholera. Oh, no... They brought him here when it hit him this afternoon. - That is, yesterday afternoon. - Why wasn't I told? He didn't want you told. When it became apparent that he... Ling sent for me as well as for you. - He... he won't... - He's worked so hard. He has no resistance. If I were you, I wouldn't go in. He wouldn't recognize you anyway. Carol. Remember what it looks like. Is he... is he still alive? Collapse has already set in. He begged that you should not see him like this. Walter. Walter. My... rough passage... almost... ...over. - How much longer, Dr. Ling? - No one can tell. Surely something can be done. There must be something. - Some drug. - I have done everything I know. At least his pain has been eased. Walter. Darling. Could I... could I please be alone with him for a little while, a few minutes? You have only to call. Walter, I beg you to forgive me. I'm so desperately sorry for the wrong I did you. I so bitterly regret it. For your own sake as well as mine, I beg you to forgive me. The dog... it was... that died. Walter. Doctor. Would you come in, please, he... He doesn't seem to be... Some day he could have forgiven me. There wouldn't be any bitterness. At least he would have died in peace. It's funny, I thought he was going to... There was something in his face just before he died. When you think of his death, think of a city that was dying... ...and then was given new life. Think of hundreds whose lives were saved. That is what counts. Not a mound of earth on a Chinese cemetary. The operation was a success, but the doctor died. What are your plans? Oh, I don't know really yet. I've even thought about staying on here. I'm glad you decided against that. It's not that easy to discover where one lives. I know. The dog it was that died... I beg your pardon. Do you know what that means? "The dog it was that died". - Is it a quotation? - Why do you ask? He said that before he died. I suppose he was delirious. He said that? I don't think he was delirious. What does it mean? It is the last line of an elegy by an English poet called Goldsmith. It is about a dog that went mad and bit the one he loved most. Everyone thought the loved one would die, but that did not happen. The dog it was that died... ...of remorse. I think he forgave you. I think he died in peace. Oh, Carol, there will be quite a crowd down at the landing to see you off, so if you don't mind, I'll say goodbye here. You're quite a girl, Carol. You just didn't know it before. - I'm glad you think so, Tim. - Lots of people think so. He did too. Tim, I... I know Walter and I had an awful time... ...but by all ordinary standards our marriage was a failure. But it wasn't a complete failure, not in the end. For all sorts of reasons that I... I don't really understand yet. All I do know is that... ...for the first time I'm beginning to like myself. And I want to go on liking myself. You will, Carol, you will. Oh, I hope you end up with acres and acres of flowers on your house. Goodbye, Tim. - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
