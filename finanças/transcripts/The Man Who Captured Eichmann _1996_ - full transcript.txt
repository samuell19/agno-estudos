[dramatic music] [cow lowing] (man on horse) 'Hey!' 'Hey-hey!' [music intensifies] [cows lowing] [music continues] [horse neighing] [intense music] [cows lowing] [creaking] [music continues] [cows lowing] [train chugging] [music continues] [dramatic music] [accordion music] [indistinct chatter] Finally, we're here. Are there tables out of the sun? Sure. Here, father. Nicolas! I thought you weren't coming back to Buenos Aires until next week. Papa, this is Nicolas. Nicolas, this is my father. - Laszlo Ungari. - Yes, yes. A pleasure. This is my father, Ricardo Klement. May we? I'm afraid we must be leaving. We're already late for-for an appointment. Sie sind Dutch? Nein. No-no. At least my parents were Dutch from Holland. We...arrived before the war. 'Good day, senor, senorita.' Hasta luego. [speaking in Foreign language] [people chattering] Your friends left fresh cups on the table. Do I look so terrifying that they were frightened off? I'm sure there was a reason. I've known Nicolas for ages. Why would he do something like that? And in that time, did you ever meet his father? Before today. Once or twice. In passing. And did he smell of that particular cologne? I never noticed. Well, I did. This time, and the other time. The smell I will never forget. And the voice. You've met Nicolas' father? Where? There. [dramatic music] [music continues] Ugh! [tires screeching] What the hell's the matter with you? Turn that damn thing off. - Peter Malkin? - Yes. What is it? Urgent message from HQ. You're needed elsewhere. Sloppy as hell. You should have looked up. Should have gone one at a time. First one watches the roof, the other one runs. You'll never make Mossad agents until you start thinking. (male #1) 'Recognize him?' No. Should I? I'd feel a lot better if you did. (Peter) 'Hold it.' That is familiar. 'I just can't pull it down.' 'My God.' Yours perhaps. Certainly not his. 'As you can see, there's no shortage' 'of photographs of Eichmann's work.' But very few of him. 'Strange in a way most Nazis loved' having their pictures taken. But Eichmann was very rarely photographed. (Peter) 'Where are we?' (male #1) 'Buenos Aires.' 'Argentina. Where else?' (Peter) 'Who have we got out there taking pictures?' Hans. Hans? - Arrogant bastard. - Good agent. Lousy photographer. Who tipped us? A blind man. You're taking it seriously? Ben Gurion takes it seriously, so does the secret service. You know how many survivors swore they have seen Eichmann. Swear, seen him. Munich, Rome, Cleveland. Buenos Aires. [laughing] 'A blind man.' [laughing] Is it worth it? I think that in this case, any possibility no matter how slim, is worth it. (Peter) 'The only way to know for certain' if this is the man is to lift him and question him. Ben Gurion's exact thoughts. Now for this Eichmann, BG wants him back here to stand trial. Remind the world why there must be a Jewish homeland. And if he's not? We take him to Paraguay. Or some other adjacent country. And we tell him if he ever speaks about what happened he will never speak again. We let him go, and we go on. It's a dangerous game.. ...to lift a man in a place like Argentina. He may not even be who we think he is. It's late. I'm tired. I'm going home. Blind man. [laughing] Friday? Usual place? Yup. [child giggling] [giggling continues] [speaking in foreign language] Klement, you've arrived. Come this way. Papa, can we go to the park? (Eichmann) 'We can go wherever your little heart desires.' (male #2) 'I promise you that March the 21st' 'will be a wonderful evening.' I, uh.. I waited an hour before I figured out you weren't coming. How smart does that make me? Sorry, Uzi. I should've phoned. Sorry? That's it? That's all I get? I'm your boss, Peter. A little groveling wouldn't be out of place, you know? Especially when I'm giving you the most important assignment you or anyone else will ever get. You see this man. 'You think of the murder of millions.' But...if we get him.. ...I'll be remembering one victim, one human being. My sister, Fruma. Young woman, mother. Sent with her children to Auschwitz.. ...to suffer unimaginable horrors and to die. And here.. ...is her murderer. My arm around his throat. [laughing] What would stop me from choking him to death? Israel has the right.. No. The moral duty to bring this man back to trial. And you've been chosen to perform that duty. You dead sure of me? Of course, I already have Hans on the ground in Buenos Aires. You drop out, I'll put him in charge. I know how much you love him, and see him get all the glory. [Uzi laughing] Come, I'll buy you breakfast. (Uzi) 'How many men do you think it will take to lift him?' Just one. Me. One man? Forget it. It's so risky. I'll have a backup. But they'll want to be working at night. If he sees too many men lurking about he's liable to panic and bolt. What if he's strong? What if he puts up a fight? I'm stronger. I have the element of surprise. At any rate, the final plan has to wait until we're in Buenos Aires We have to know the terrain where he lives what his movements are-- - Yeah, Hans is already on that. - No, no. I don't want him. But you're stuck with him. Once you lift the man, you'll need the best interrogator in the world to determine if it is Eichmann. They don't call Hans a Spanish inquisitor for nothing. Relax. He'll know you're in charge. Now what about the rest of the team? 'You'll need a documents man.' 'I've already spoken with Danny.' At first Hans, now Danny. Why do you pick the team? You'll need the best. Which means, Danny picks himself. There's none better. Don't make a big deal. We still got to think of a front man. 'I'll send David to talk you.' (Peter) 'I don't want him. He's a playboy.' (Uzi) 'Talk to him anyway.' I know you think I'm unreliable. That I live too high. But who better to be a front man for a job like this? A housekeeper? Driver? (Uzi) 'It's gotta be Meir. He's the best.' (Peter) 'Meir. He's good, but he hates to travel.' I don't care if we're going after the messiah. What if it was Adolf Eichmann? Okay. Actually the doctor has also been pre-selected. [chuckling] What doctor? Ben Gurion himself picked a doctor. You have a beef speak with the prime minister. Alright. But I want one thing understood. I take the men. Peter, listen to me carefully. I won't say it again. We're going to bring Adolf Eichmann to trial in Jerusalem and you are going to capture him. You, personally, you are in charge. Code name, "Operation Attila." Attila? So creative. So unusual. I'll leave the cleverness to you, kid. I want the team assembled in my office by Wednesday! [melancholic music] [music continues] [chanting prayer] [chanting continues] [chanting continues] Peter? [speaking foreign language] Amen. Why are you so interested in the family pictures all of a sudden? And the time you visit, you never gave them a glance. Today would have been my sister's birthday, wouldn't it? You're a good boy to remember. Yes, it would. What reminded you? I don't know. Been thinking of such things today. I think of it every day. Ah, Fruma. Such a wonderful girl, your big sister. [chuckling] Always quick with a laugh, a smile, a kind word. 'Even the Poles liked her.' Maybe that's why she and her husband thought they could wait. We warned them, mind you. Come with us, we said. Come with us. 'But to get exit visas from the Poles, that took money.' 'Too much for all of us.' So, Fruma, always the capable one she said, "Let's stay and save the money." '"We'll meet you there" she said.' "You'll see. We'll find a way out" she said. "We'll bring the whole family." "We'll all be together again" she said. [sighing] [melancholic music] Gone. All gone. 'Gone up the chimney in Auschwitz' And the world stood silent. Ah! I trust you all recognize Isser Harel. You better. We all serve at his pleasure. - Hello. - Shalom. (Uzi) 'Okay. Let's go over it again.' David was expressing concern that the family's buying airline tickets. (David) 'What do we learn from this?' (Peter) 'The man's buying airplane tickets.' (Uzi) 'According to Hans, the tickets are for Ancud.' 'It's a-a resort in Chile.' (Isser) 'Do you think he's on to us?' (Uzi) 'Peter and I doubt it.' 'Hans was able to date a travel agent' 'who dropped the fact that it seemed to be a holiday' 'to celebrate the Klement's wedding anniversary.' 'A gift from their sons.' (David) 'Which also puzzles me.' 'According to my maps, it's one of the worst' 'neighborhoods in the city.' (Isser) 'Yeah, it doesn't look like they're living' 'in the lap of luxury.' No. And that's interesting too. [Latin music] [music continues] (Uzi) 'According to Hans, the family's apparently poor.' 'They had some kind of party last week.' 'The sons paid for that too.' 'Hans was hoping that would give us' 'an idea of who their friends are.' 'This is our problem.' 'Is Klement really Eichmann.' [music continues] [indistinct chattering] (Klement on radio) 'Ladies and gentlemen. Dear friends.' 'My dear wife Catalina and I..' Wait. What name? (Klement on radio) 'My dear wife Catalina and I are celebrating an important day.' 'This is the most important day of my life.' '21st day of March 1935..' Hold on, I can improve that. '21st day of March 1935.' I think it's their wedding anniversary. - The Eichmanns was married on-- - March 21st, 1935. It's Eichmann. David, lot's of people were married on that day. And his wife's name was Vera not Catalina. His name is Adolf, not Ricardo. Whoever it is, they're celebrating their silver wedding. And the dates match. Quiet. Quiet! The bird flies home tomorrow night. Just as Hans predicted. What does that do to us? Nothing. You focus on the preparations. Get ready to pay him a visit. - What if he doesn't come back? - Don't even think it. If this man is Eichmann.. ...the next trip he takes will be to Tel Aviv. - I'll beat the.. - Not again. [telephone ringing] Malkin. (Isser) 'The bird's come home.' [tires screeching] [speaking in foreign language] (male #3) 'What's your name!' (male #4) 'My name is De'marquise. 'And that is a diplomatic passport.' 'Enjoy your visit, Herr Nolte.' Danke. [instrumental music] [music continues] The others? Are safe and sound on the Air France morning flight. David found us a fantastic apartment. 'He told the vendor lady he was organizing a family reunion' 'and needed a place for the cousins to keep out of sight' until the big night when they could surprise the grandparents. And they believed a story like that? Of course. Boy, can that boy lie. [music continues] [doorbell buzzing] [speaking in foreign language] Okay. The welcome is over. Time is short. Peter, I need your final plan as soon as possible. 'I know you're tired and jetlagged.' I want you recon the Klement house tonight. Just you, David, Uzi. What about the Spanish inquisitor? Hans? I haven't called him in yet. Just in case he's been spotted. 'Come on, let's go.' [intense music] [speaking in foreign language] Out of the car. [music continues] [music continues] [car revving] (David) 'Only his youngest son Hasse, lives with him.' 'The others Dieter and Nicolas live in town.' 'He always gets back between 7:20 and 8:00.' (Peter) 'Good. Creature of habit.' [engine revving] [thunder rumbling] (Peter) 'There he is.' One look in the dark and the pouring rain and he's sure. Look at him! The way he walks like a soldier. 'Even in this slum, he walks like somebody.' [music continues] (Peter) 'What's he doing?' (Uzi) He's teaching the kid to count. [Peter laughing] (Peter) 'Bastard!' Still with the trains. (male #5) 'It need a little work sure but I--' (David) 'I'll take it.' - You'll take it? - That's right. And I'll pay cash. If you reduce the price and give an immediate occupancy. [thunder rumbling] Oh! [grunting] Alright. You got the lift in 10 seconds but 20 seconds getting him in to the car, it's too long. - Let's go again. - Are you crazy? No, it might be raining on the night. Let's go again. [grunting] Plenty of room. We shouldn't all be at one place so I'll stay at the apartment with Danny. [bell ringing] [pleasant music] There's a space between the floor board and the foundation. 15 to 20 inches. We can hide him there if we have to. Good. (David) 'Ready?' Okay, try it. [bell ringing] [dramatic music] [indistinct chatter] Now you understand that this is done to scale. [doorbell buzzing] It must be Danny and Uzi back from the airport with Dr. Klein. What is it? Is there a problem? No, no. I've got it figured out. Come on. I wondered where you'd been. Holding up my part of the weight. You? Same. Well, you come at a good moment. We can go over the final plans for the capture of Attila. - What? - My plan. Isser approved it. [doorbell buzzing] Here. Our own doctor. Now we can even get sick. It's over there. [Dr. Klein retching] (Uzi) 'He got air sick. Claims that never happened before.' - You two-- - I've not had anything. Your friend Peter seems pissed off that my plan is ready. - Your plan? - You didn't know about this? No one knows. Only Isser and me. I've been here longest. I know the terrain. Now here's the plan. No arguments. Peter, you wait here. Jump him, hold him. Meir, you'll be hiding here. We'll come to help. 'The rest of us will be in two cars, there.' When you've secured him, we spin around, pick him up, take off. No problem. Makes sense to me. It's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. With Meir and I remain here exposed while you wait over here in adjacent cars? What if a cop passes by or a pedestrian seeing two cars parked side by side? It wouldn't happen if your job fast! Schmuck. Schmuck! A good plan assumes nothing! 'What happens if I blackout or taken in the middle of a job. - Have you planned for that? - 'Of course.' Under no circumstances you release Attila. You say that you are Israelis, emissaries of the Jewish people. On a mission aimed at-at writing a historic wrong. But under no circumstances do you let him go. Oh! Moron! Amateur! This is an adolescent fantasy of someone who wants to be a Jewish hero. Or a martyr. I intend to take this man and have him back in Israel before anyone knows he's missing. This is the plan and you will follow it. Isser's orders. Then you and Isser do it. This is not up for discussion. - You are not the only-- - This man is a complete idiot! You're like a pair of pit bulls. I think it's a good plan. It's ridiculous! 'It has too many dangers. There are no contingencies.' - And your plan has contingence? - Yes! Yes. Look! Look! Look! The car is parked here on Garibaldi. It's near to where the action's going to take place. It's where nearer to me. This car is parked on the shoulder of the highway. That way, no one gets suspicious. Car pulls up here, blocks off the street, pulls up, sh-sh. We're gone. What if he sees one of you and he panics? He could cut right across this adjacent field, reach his house. - He won't. - Yes. How could you be so sure of this? It's autumn. It's been raining. The field is muddy. German soldiers who walk like this man? They're very fastidious. They like clean uniform, shiny boots. If Klement is an SS officer he won't get mud on his shoes. You can tell this from the way he walks. Risk the whole operation based on the guess of one man? About how some SS officer walks? Yes...if that man is Peter. [sighing] Alright, I agree. But just remember, this is on your head. And there is no physical harm to the target tomorrow night. [dramatic music] [music continues] [music continues] Shall we? [music continues] [car revving] [music continues] [thunder rumbling] [rumbling continues] [speaking in foreign language] No, thanks. [speaking in foreign language] No, no. It's finished. [music intensifies] Un momentito, signor. Un momentito, signor. [engine revving] [thunder rumbling] You said he was a creature of habit. He suspects us. The wife, she saw you! Couldn't have. Simply missed the bus, that's all. Oh, that's one contingency you didn't think of, did you? (Uzi) 'Quiet. Peter thinks of everything.' Peter, what do we do now? [music intensifies] We're on. [music continues] [music intensifies] Un momentito, signor. Un momentito, signor. [music intensifies] (Peter) Un momentito, signor! [intense music] [groaning] [screaming] [music continues] [thunder rumbling] [engine revving] [dogs barking] (Hans) What is your name? I am Ricardo Klement. - What is your name? - I am Ricardo Klement. (Hans) Take off his jacket, coat and shirt. Check tattoo. Left forearm. - There's nothing here to.. - It's all been removed. Your blood group perhaps. What is your name? Ricardo Klement. [speaking in foreign language] Check the left hand. There should be a scar on one side of it. (Peter) 'I-It's not here.' - Gold bridges in-- - Yes, yes, yes. It's here. Two gold bridges in the upper jaw. Open your mouth. Open your mouth! No. No, this man wears dentures. Head measurements and height? Fifty six centimeters. 178 centimeters, height. Both dead on. [speaking in foreign language] - Ricardo Klement-- - Stop playing games. We know your SS number is 4-5-5-2-6. A silly trick and I'm not a fool. We both know it was 4-5-3-2-6. (Hans) 'Wonderful.' What is your birth name? Ich bin Adolf Eichmann. There's nothing in here. Where is his hat? It's not in the car. Where is his hat? Oh, it fell off. It fell off. [engine revving] [dogs barking] [barking continues] Good, Peter. Good job. Now, orders from Isser. Only Hans is to question him. You are in charge of his basic needs but may speak to him only about food and toilet. No one else gets to say a word to him. Understand? Un momentito, signor. Open your eyes. I have some questions for you. If you answer them, things will go easily for you. I understand, sir. (Hans) 'I want to know of your colleagues.' 'We are interested in Josef Mengele.' You know where he is? - I know nothing about him. - You know nothing about him? Well, he's a doctor who experimented on human beings. Does that help? 'Is he in Argentina?' What about Hitler's deputy, Martin Bormann? - Where is he? - I have no idea. I want to know about your friends who helped you escape 'from Europe, who supplied you with false papers.' 'How did you get into Argentina?' That was a long time ago, sir. [speaking in foreign language] Nein. What about your family? Is there anything we can do for them? What have you done to them? Please don't hurt them. I make no promises. My job is to get answers from you. If I get them, I will have no reason to concern myself with anything else. Your obvious answer tried to create anxiety in the subject. - Create anxiety? - 'Mm-hmm.' - It is already raging in you. - Hmm, of course, ja. Ja. I particularly worry about my son, Hasse. He's too young to understand these things of who you are and why you would want me. So, you know who we are. Sir, I've not spent the last 16 years without ever considering the possibility of this day. 'You are of course, Israelis. I know immediately.' (Hans) 'Then you should know your son is safe.' [dogs barking] [man on radio speaking foreign language] Nothing. That's the third newscast and not a word about a disappearance. Not a mention of Eichmann or Klement. Nothing. Maybe the family is not just sitting there. Silence means that they are not using the police but they are going private. Hmm, which is more dangerous for us. A hit would come from anywhere. Not just the man in uniform. So, we have to re-think security. 'We've to confine ourselves to the house.' Why? Isser, we need fresh air. Danny's on the headsets, so the neighbors won't hear that. Radio day and night, what's the problem? They may get suspicious of the comings and goings. Nothing but men. So fresh air and exercise will be taken only at night. You will read this, please. And sign it. It says that you recognize Israel's jurisdiction-- That is untrue. If I'm to be tried, I wish it to be in Germany-- I'm sure you would. But you are going to Israel. Peter, he absolutely must eat. And if he doesn't go to the toilet he'll become deathly ill. You want to eat? From the moment we took you off the street you became once again... a soldier. So.. ...eat. Eat. That's an order. Open wide. Here comes the train. [clinking] (Peter) 'Get up.' Deep knee bends. Ready? Down. Up. Come on. Down. Up. Down. Up. Down. Up. - Down. Up. Down. Up. - I fear, I.. - Let's go. - Mmm. [Peter speaking in foreign language] - 'May I begin, sir?' - Ja. (Eichmann) 'Excuse me. Oooh. Ooh.' [Eichmann speaking in foreign language] [Eichmann groaning] [laughing] (Eichmann) 'Sir...permission to wipe?' [laughing] Ja. Better. (Uzi) So, what is it? - I need to talk to him, Uzi. - Who, Eichmann? Oh, forget about it, Peter. Don't even think about it. Talk to me instead. First time I saw this man with his goggles and his pajamas he's there shivering, he's terrified. All I could think was, "This is the man who is responsible for the murder of my sister?" I couldn't believe it. He is so-so unremarkable. He's so ordinary. I want to ask him how. I want to understand. - He's so ordinary. - Yeah. Well, perhaps only ordinary people can do such things. More ordinary, the more evil. Oh, this little man. He's straining on the toilet ooh, prrr. How? How is he responsible for the murder of six million human beings. How? I want to ask him how. Peter, you've done your job. Now let others do theirs. - Yeah? - Yeah. We can't go on like this. Morale is getting low. It's because we don't know what's going on out there. There's nothing to worry about. Come on, Isser. What about the family? What are they doing? Who are they talking to? Have the authorities been alerted? Are they hunting for us? Are they-- We're as much prisoner as he is. And we're getting paranoid. Would you both relax? We're safe from his Nazi friends. 'Oh, by the way, tell the-tell the team' I'm bringing in a female agent to help run the house. - A female? Who? - I wont know till she arrives. For cover, she'll be David's wife. They'll go out together. They'll be seen around, she'll give an air of normality for the neighbors and she'll be good for morale. And, uh, where will she sleep? 'Well she needs to be near kitchen, you both need to be' near the prisoner, there's only two rooms downstairs. So...she gets to share with one of you. Heads. So, you didn't see anyone suspicious? Like a tourist taking photographs? - Nothing like that? - I don't think so. I haven't noticed. Very well. Leave it to us. We will be in touch. Please, do not mention this to anyone else. Understood? [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] Are you the man who captured me? Of course, no one may speak to me. All the same. I know it is you. I recognize the voice. After so long as a hunted animal one's senses become sharp to such things. You performed well. It was quick, efficient and relatively painless. I complement your professionalism. Thanks. Only two. One, still unconscious. This one's lost his memory. My father has a scar. Just under his left arm. It's not him. [knocking on door] - Anything unusual? - What's with the tie? Hey, she's here. Uh, go. I'll take over. Go, say hello. I hope she can cook. - Any good food with you? - Lots of good matzo. (female #1) 'I'm sure you're all hungry. I can tell.' - Rosa. - Peter. It's so wonderful what you did. I'm so grateful for the chance to help. - Thank you. - Where am I sleeping? Uh, with Peter. We tossed for it. But first can I...can I see him? I want to see him. [knocking on door] Okay. Did you loose anyone at the camps? Sister. Cousins. He killed most of my family. The thought of cooking for him, touching anything he touches makes me want to vomit. I'd sooner see him killed here and now. But I'm sure you feel the same way. Excuse me. You find it difficult to even look upon me. It's a pity because I like it best when you're here. May I at least have a name to call you or think of you by? - My name is Maxim. - Maxim. I see. [speaking in foreign language] More like your first name, correct? May I ask you a question, Maxim? Do you have news of my family? Please do not hurt them. Family. We're all vulnerable there, aren't we? [speaking in foreign language] I appreciate your reply even if it's not the answer to my question. You want answers. So do I. By all means. How did it happen? How did you come to do what you did. How? - 'How did..' - It was four of us. As a soldier you must understand. This was no battlefront. Nor was Dachau. Treblinka, Sobibor. They were butcher shops. You must understand. I do not hate the Jews. I never have. I tell the truth when I say I am not an anti-Semite. That makes your crimes even worse. You call them crimes? But one cannot always choose life's path. 'Very ordinary circumstances' 'often produce extraordinary results.' You want to know how it happened? Alright. 'It began when a friend' 'persuaded me to join a rifle club.' It was near my home in Linz, Austria. Do you know it, Linz? 'Hmm?' It was the first time I had held a rifle but I quickly became the marksman. Those were bad days. Too much marching in the streets with monarchists, nationalists and of course, Nazis, you know. One day the Nazi staged a mass rally in a big beer hall. A man, Carlton Bernd was a lawyer with business connections to my father, came up to me, put his hand on my shoulder looked me straight in the eye and said, "You must join us." It was that simple. All very free and easy, no fuss. I said "Alright." And there I was. I was a member of the SS. Now, you must tell me.. '...how's my family?' [siren blaring] There must've been 100's of members at the rifle club. 'Many of them I'm sure, ended up in the SS party.' They don't have the blood of six million human beings on their hands. No. Fortunes of war. And when Austria banned the Nazi party I left for Germany for training at an SS barracks. I was very happy, with the discipline fellowship, the life. You as a soldier surely must understand. Training was extremely hard but I didn't mind. 'My father was a strong man so I was accustomed to being led.' We'd crawl through mud, over gravel. Skin scraped off my elbows but I didn't bandage them. I stuck it out. That attracted attention and I was promoted. And when Himmler was looking for men I thought this looks good to me. A place where the action will be. So, I was sent to Berlin to an office dealing with Freemasons. There, I met a decent fellow, Von Mildenstein. who was organizing a Jews department and asked me to join. I always regard him as my mentor. He gave me books on Jews and Zionism and soon I became an expert on the Jews. Hm. Now, about my family. [knock on door] As far as I know, they're alright. We're not interested in your family. Please, don't leave. Stay here with me, please. [singing in foreign language] [singing continues] I don't believe your father has met with an accident. Nor do I believe he's dead. It would seem more likely that he has been kidnapped. Kidnapped? By whom? The Jews? Of course, the Jews. American Jews or Israelis. But the hopeful aspect is that he is still here in Buenos Aires. And since the authorities are friendly to our cause he will find it very difficult to get out of the country. We will find your father. And we will stop them. Up. Down. Up. Down. Up. Down. Up. Down.. Up. Down. I've been thinking about your question. May I talk more? My SS officer's oath was to Adolf Hitler personally. I was not released from that oath until he died. And.. ...he was like my father, a strong personality. Whatever I did I always asked myself if the Fuhrer hears of my actions...will he uphold? And the answer was always yes? When the Fuhrer said, "Kill the Jews," you killed the Jews. No, no. I did not kill any Jews. I was in charge of transport, nothing more. Of course, certain lies have been spoken about me. Hoess, the Commandant of Auschwitz said monstrous things told monstrous lies at his trial. Said I discussed with him how the Jews were to be exterminated. You deny it? Well, such a thing was not possible because this aspect was handled entirely by the Department of Administration and Supply. My sole responsibility was the shipment's transportation organizing the trains. But you knew where those trains were going. You knew you were sending millions of people to camps. Well, yes, I knew that, but.. And you knew that those camps had gas chambers and crematorium and you knew that every Jew in your ship would be gassed or shot or starved or worked or beaten to death, you knew that. That was not my province. Once the shipments were complete my responsibility ceased. My duties ended at the gates of the camps. No, you knew that-- Besides, hundreds and thousands survived. That's a fact, Maxim. I had nothing to do with the concentration camps. You knew that. Would someone come in and relieve me? You misunderstand me, Maxim. (Hans) 'There's no question that we're going to get you to Israel.' Would you rather be brought there like a cornered animal a whipped dog or as a man of dignity with his head held high? I've already said if I'm to stand trial it must be in Germany. Don't you understand that Germany doesn't want you. 'The West Germans, they want to forget the past' 'and get on with the future.' You don't wanna be handed over to the East German communists? Communist cannot by definition be considered true Germans. I was German serving the German state of that time. I should be tried by my peers in the west. Crimes you are charged with were committed all over Europe and against the Jewish people. Israel is today. They're legitimate representatives. I understand it, but no.. [speaking in foreign language] I apologize for making you angry last time, Maxim. It was unintentional. Really. What did you expect? That you as a fellow professional would understand that I was doing my job. Doing it well. Indeed. A man must be judged by his hard work. Always. And it wasn't always easy, I assure you. What with the Wehrmacht trying to seize my trains to move the troops. Not that they ever succeeded. [dogs barking] Ha ha ho, God. How can you say that to me? Don't you understand.. ...I am a Jew. Ja, of course. [sighing] I miss my wife. I hope she's safe. We were to go to the country this weekend.. ...with Hasse. Do you ever go on picnics? Tell me, I'd like to hear. Please, tell me something about yourself. It can do no harm. Do you have a girlfriend? Nothing steady. The job makes it too difficult. Oh, ja, I understand such pressures and women require so much attention. Does this talk causes you to frown, why? I don't know. Sometimes I think.. ...I use the job.. ...as an excuse, a way to avoid the responsibility of marriage. A man must fulfill his destiny and women who can please them? Now, tell me, do you dance, do you like music? 'Good wine, good music, what can be better?' I hope you like Viennese Waltz. - Of course and you love nature. - Yes. Now, be quite. Suddenly there are something's we can understand together. But not last time when you became angry and left me, I was very upset. You misunderstood me on that occasion. No. I don't think so. You did, ja, ja. You see, I have followed events read what people said at the trials. Always the same thing, "We were following orders." But my position's quite different. 'I obeyed the law.' - You see the difference? - No. But you must have, law of the Germans state the Reichstag decree that Jews be deported, the Fuhrer agreed. Maxim, have you never obeyed a law you would prefer to ignore or do you accept the will of your government of the Jewish state? Do you not obey laws that in your heart you doubt-- I would have volunteered for the gas chamber myself before I did what you did. Really? Hmm. As I listened, I thought you understood that a job is a job. It must be done despite one's personal feelings. - A matter of honor. - Honor? - 'Honor?' - Ja, ja. No. With you it was more than that. You adored your work. Even when Himmler told you to stop the murder you ignored him. You push, push, push, pushed on.. ...to the bloody end. Himmler was protecting himself from the victorious allies pretending he was not one of us. But he could not give orders contrary to law. Had I obeyed Himmler, I would be breaking the law defying the Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler. No. What in one's job one had targets to meet the transports had to continue. I did my duty. [speaking in foreign language] I think you understand me better now. Ja, ja. You and all the other Germans who simply obeyed the law. Good. Now, you begin to understand. Did I tell you? Yes, I told you. I do not hate the Jews. This is the truth. I had Jewish friends, I read Zionism. I fully understand the aspiration of the Jews. 'Had I been born Jewish, I would.. ...have been the most fervent Zionist.' Zionist idealist like me. I am an idealist. You know.. ...I even studied Hebrew with a rabbi in Berlin. It was something like.. [speaking in foreign language] Something like that. Hmm. [chuckling] 'Do you know what those words mean?' The most sacred statement in the Jewish faith? Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. Do you know what Aba and Ema mean? - No. - Father, mother. Mommy, daddy. My sister's boy was about your son's age. 'He was my playmate..' ...and you killed him. But he was Jewish, wasn't he? It was the law. Rosa, are you asleep? Not anymore. I've been talking to him. You talked to him? Oh, how could you? 'It's against orders.' I should report you. I wish you would. It's been on my conscience, I.. It's heavy and just.. Want to talk to someone, sorry. Goodnight. Peter. [Peter crying] Peter, are you alright? [crying] It's okay. It's okay. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. - It's okay. - I'm sorry. What's he like? I don't know. [chuckling] You talk to him yet you don't know? I don't know. He's totally without pity. He has no moral sense of what he's done it's as if he's asking for admiration for how well he did his job. I should have.. ...broken his neck. I should have broken his neck. Oh, thank God, Peter, that you could never do such a thing. You're nothing like Eichmann. Don't try to convince you that you are. [upbeat music] [tapping fingers] Doctor, please, stop that. It's driving me crazy. And for God sake, David, turn off the music. [music stops] Come on, Danny, let's go. Isser, be sensible. Time is not our ally. We need to know how we're going to get him out of here? There's only three choices. Car, sea or air. Both from here to Israel will take two months. Driving a car across the border is too dangerous what with custom searches and border checks. El Al doesn't serve Argentina. We can't get him out of Argentina-- Stop it. There's another way. I just can't tell you the details. Not for a few days. Isser, with each day, each minute we become more vulner-- I said I'm working on it. You do your jobs, and I will do mine. Captain, I believe that these Jews are out in Argentina by kidnapping one of our citizens right from under our noses. I don't believe either one of us wants this to happen. No. No, definitely not. It would be wise to keep a close watch on airports and ships. Yes. They can't legally take him out of this country 'without his consent.' Something I'm sure Eichmann would not give them. [mellow music] I appreciate this, Maxim. I really love music. I couldn't find a Viennese Waltz but I did find some wine. It's very gentlemanly of you, Maxim. I value such behavior. I thought it would cheer you. Toast. [music continues] Tell me, Maxim, do you believe in faith? Do we all have inescapable destinies? I don't think about such things. You obviously do. Yes, I do. Bad dreams, nightmares? No, nothing of that sort. A fortune teller. Imagine me worried about a fortune teller. Gypsy or so she said. I still believe she was a Jewish. What did she see for you? My death before my 57th birthday she said. You're presently 55. God, that is true. I'm told that in Israel there is no death penalty, is that true? It's not important. What matters is the court gives you.. It gives you a chance to explain yourself to them the way you have to me these past few days. Good. But will they listen? I have, haven't I? Yes, you have, did it ease the pain? That's all I can do. Ease it. Only you can make it go away. [sighing] The worst ist Hasse. I miss him. I ache for him. We get on so well, he's so very bright. Learns quickly. He can count up to 100. And I'm a loving father, I am. Because you see my own father was.. Well, that's important. Hasse should understand what happened. Hear it from your own lips. Sign the statement. 'Hasse will hear your story.' And all the other children who wonder about their parents. How it happened. Is that why you give me wine, tobacco, to induce me to sign? Following your orders, right, Maxim? If they knew I was talking to you.. I would be disciplined. Then why? To ease my pain. To understand. 'Now, I do.' And know you must sign. Come willingly to trial, tell your story just as you've told it to me. Read it. Carefully. It promises you every opportunity to explain 'in the fair trail.' If I am to be charged, it must be in Germany. Germany? Haven't the Germans suffered enough? Would you have them taken to those dark years? Better to come to Israel where the Nazis will be on trial not the new Germany. It would be an act of kindness to everyone who served to leave Germany out of this. Ja, ja, there's some sense in what you say. Ja. Then sign. [sighing] The new Germany you say. Have they forgotten me so quickly? Forgotten how we felt who we were? You would never understand that. I can try. The West Germans won't. They need a scapegoat. Someone to blame for the horrors committed in their name but in Israel we want to understand. At least we'll be looking for truth, not excuses. Sign, sign for Hasse. You really believe I would be tried fairly by Jews? Who better? We have no guilt in this matter. - We can be fair. - Really? How sure you are. How certain of your morality. You were not there. You did not see our fear, hear that voice. How he raised us up. Made us remember how great we were how great we would be again. We were grateful he had chosen us, the German people to free the world of Bolshevism, to make us a proud nation. You were not there, you cannot know. Had he chosen you, the Jews, would you not have listened? Would you have forsaken him? You cannot know unless you were there. We were him. He, we were him, he was us. We were great because he was great. And you will never ever understand that. Ever unser God, Adolf Hitler. Ever unser God! Jews. Adolf Eichmann. It will be good to explain myself. Talking to you has helped, Maxim. You understand me now. Maxim, will you come and visit me in Jerusalem? [laughing] Enjoy and there's plenty more. Oh, there's plenty more. Just what I was afraid of. Keep your voice down. She's doing the best she can. Listen to him, it was a good idea having them bunk together. [shouting indistinctly] Come on, let's go. She's a decent person, lay off. Hey, quiet, you two. Things are bad enough as it is. - You okay? - I'm fine. It may be a touch of claustrophobia. We need to get him out. We're on the news. 'It's good news.' Israel is sending a delegation to the independent celebration. A delegation headed by Abba Eban. 'He arrives the day after tomorrow.' And I wonder how he's getting here? El Al, how else. The whole plane for Abba Eban? And the crew. You sent for a diplomatic delegation so we could have a plane. Lucky timing. I assume Abba Eban knows about us. The truth.. ...I have no idea. [laughing] 'We're going home.' [crowd cheering] Mr. Foreign Minister. [speaking in foreign language] How many languages does he speak? [speaking in foreign language] [band music] Get up. Get undressed. I miss my exercise, we go for a walk? A long one to Jerusalem. [dramatic music] [music continues] [music continues] 'I don't need any injections. I won't utter a sound, I promise.' Are you going to kill me? No, I'm not that kind of doctor. 'This is to control excitement.' - Hold still. - I'm not excited. Hold still, hold still. Stay still. Stay still! Don't harm my family. Especially my little Hasse. I wish I could see him. I wish I could be with him. Ja. [car horn honking] Don't worry about me. You can rely on me. Delegation came on El Al flight, they will use that plane. You raise the alarm. Notify air traffic control and stop them from taking off. Bastards! [intense music] I don't need injections. [music continues] 'You're late.' [speaking in foreign language] [music continues] [speaking in foreign language] Out of my way. I must stop an aircraft. There's an Argentinian on the El Al plane you must stop him. On whose authority? I'm telling you there's one of us on the plane. [intense music] Court order? I have no time for a court order. The plane is Israeli. You need proof the Jews are up to no good? - Yes, I need proof. - Oh.. For you Fruma. For all of you. [music continues] [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues]
