I'm still here. Okay. Okay. Soon as possible. No, it's not... it's not your fault. Monday at nine is fine. Hey, babe? - Yeah? - You feeling okay? - Yeah. - Okay, well, I made breakfast. It's downstairs whenever you're ready, okay? You sleep okay? - Not really. - What? Really? How come? There's no news. Hmm. Okay. Okay. I know it's not really a no news is good news kind of situation. - Sure isn't. - Anything I can do? You could get me a new body. I like your body and your brain. Nice save. What? I like it all. I really do. That's good because by the time this is all over, there's probably not going to be much left. Oh my gosh, you're gonna hate me. I signed us up for a get-together tonight. What? Cody and Will invited us over, fucking Scott's in town. - Scott, when did he get back... - Just yesterday, I guess. Guy's been gone for so long I almost forgot about him, but... Cody made it seem like he wasn't saying that long, though, so... There's no way that I can talk you out of this? Ab! They're not even my friends and I... I've tried. Just, I just don't... I don't think I'm up for being around people right now. It might be nice just to get out! No, but last time... They're just asking too many questions. I know they're weird and they're odd, but I promise they won't ask you a thing. Do they know? Only what they knew then. I swear I haven't told them anything. I... I swear to God. One question, one pathetic look... I'm out. I'll go to a party, but I'm not going to a pity party. Abbey, it'll be fun. I promise. You are getting awfully liberal with your promises. I know. Don't you guys hate Scott? Wasn't he in a cult? What are you, a priest or something like that? No. Scott's not in a cult. That's literally what you told me on our second date. "I have this friend who's in a cult." More of a self-help kind of... Well, isn't that why he went out of the country in the first place? Yes, Abbey. Yes. Yeah, I know. It's just... Oh, my God. Ugh! When's the last time you watched this thing out? - What? - Oh, it tastes chalky. There's a chalky undertone. - Do you have anything else? - No, I'm sorry, babe. That's it, just take a big drink and pretend it's something else. Wine it is. So, Cody's been talking to Scott, it sounds like he did some soul searching. Cody or Scott? Sounds like Scott did some soul searching between Europe and Africa. Finally got things all figured out. Okay. But he's a good guy, you'll like him. Yeah, you mean he didn't try to rope you into his self-help bullshit? Yeah, he definitely did. So... does Cody go to a doctor at the hospital? I saw him at the hospital the other day and I didn't say anything. Did he see me? Didn't mention anything to me - he was at the hospital. - Yeah. Why didn't you say anything? I was a "see you next Tuesday" last Tuesday. Oh, gotcha. - Yeah. - Yeah, Cody goes there. Not as much as he used to, though.. It's this rare thing. Morgellons disease. It's like maybe medical or psychological. There's par... there's particles under his skin that make him feel like he's been infested with bugs. - Jesus! - I know it's fucked up, but I don't know. He seems to be doing a lot better. He told me that he takes medication for it, but when it gets bad, he usually scratches the hell out of his shoulder. He seems to be, you know, a lot happier, I guess. You know, he didn't like his body, either. That is not even close to the same thing. But I get what you're saying. Yeah, I didn't know that. It's actually how I met Will. At the hospital. - Really? - Mhmm. Huh. Well, wasn't he...- Wait a minute. Where are we going? I thought we were going to Cody's. Speaking of places where people meet. Oh, okay, so you mean we actually left early once for a good reason? I am what I am. You're ridiculous. Watch your step. Hey, isn't this the spot we had our first kiss? Yeah. You want to check it out? Sure. What's in the woods? Oh, my gosh, can you believe we made it all the way back here? No, I'm surprised that this is still here. I know. Oh my gosh. Hey, I'm sorry, I'm making you go to this thing tonight. I mean, it's fine. It'll probably be... tolerable. You know, it's not our anniversary right? Give me a little credit. Come on. I will say, it's... it's nice to be outside. We should probably do this more often. We've had so much going on. I'm sorry, it feels like everything has to stop. Yeah. It's just, I mean... It's definitely hard to multitask with... whatever's growing inside of me. I'm sorry, you know, I know my friends aren't your friends, but tonight... Can I just not be me tonight? What do you mean? Pissed and worrying all the time. A "see you next Tuesday." Basically... Basically... You have a reason to be. I know, and I think that's part of my problem. Like, somehow, if I'm not like this, that it'll just be worse. I think it's the opposite. You're probably right, but... - Fuck. - Hey, listen, we're going to make you a new you tonight, okay? - Okay. - Yeah, close your eyes. From your favorite little shop. Okay. All right, open. What? Tourmaline? - Yes. - I love it. This is beautiful. A little hippie lady, the little crazy hippie lady said it was good for healing. Oh, that hippie lady's name is Parker. Well, Parker's little nuts but she did say it was good for healing, so. Okay, well, let's try it out. You're going to have to tighten this. Okay. How does it feel? Perfect. I feel better already. Good, good. You actually went into Maiden, Mother & Crone - all by your lonesome? - She's a little wild, but it was worth it. - Anything for you. - Well, I'm going to need all the help I can get to get through tonight. Oh, come on! I'm kidding, but seriously... you've got to be the designated driver. Okay, deal. That makes sense. - I can do that. - Okay. But we do have to stop and get wine for Will because he's a little weird, so we should probably do that now. Oh, okay. We don't have to stay too long. Pinky swear, bitch. Oh, my God, ladies. Oh, come in, come in. Sorry, we ran a little late. Oh, it's fine. I'm just glad you guys are here. Oh, my gosh, give me a hug! It's so good to see you too. Good to see you too. Been way too long. And hello. - You look great. - Oh, thanks. Here, I brought you some medicine. Ah, merci beaucoup. We know it's your favorite. Just what the doctor ordered. Cody's in the kitchen for once. Hey, what's up? - Cody, how are you? - Abbey, how are you? Good to see you. Nice to see you, Abbey. How have you been? Oh, good. Good. Good. - How about you? - Great. Everything's great. We've been looking forward to this night. Oh, Miranda got this for me today. - Love it. - Thanks. So is anyone else here? On the way. Scott'll be late. Like usual. Come on, it's funny. Anyways, I really love the house. Oh my God. Right? Come on, I'm going to give you a tour. - Okay. - All right. I'm going to go with him, salvage his cooking. Well, I love what you guys have done with the place. Yeah, we love it. Something always needs doing. But we love it. Come on, I'll show you the rest of the place. Okay. I'm sorry that we haven't been over here sooner. Ah, you're fine. We totally get it. I mean, it's not like we haven't been busy. You ever met Scott? No, but Miranda's told me about him. Yeah, I think you'll like him. He's a little... crazy, but he's interesting. He's actually been emailing us while he's been gone. - Miranda too? - Yeah. Everyone. Has she not been showing you the pictures? No. Oh, well. Well, I don't have my phone on me to show you. But I gotta say, that sounds like her. What do you mean? She, uh... always kept to herself. Not in a bad way. You know, a bad thing. No, it's okay. She's always got something going on. So... Scott's in some cult? Kinda... sorta... but no, not anymore, at least. - Mainly... - Self-help? Yeah. We all bought into it a few years ago. That's actually why he left the country. To see if there was any truth to it all. Was there? So, Cody said he saw you at the hospital the other day. - Everything all right? - Um, I... - Hey guys! - Hey! Sorry, we're late. Hey. Oh, well, look who it is! Abbey, how you been? Oh, great, great. I'm great. - That's cool. - Thank you. So, what's the status on Cody's dishes, Miranda? Everything's decent with enough salt. I heard that. This means so much to Will and I. Every day, we go through so much shit that life throws at us. I... I just think we all need an escape. From all of this. We're always better who we're together. Hear, hear. So let's shed all of this. And be what we should be. Okay, admittedly, I'm a little drunk. Just a little. But everything's set up outside, so come on. That sounded pretty self help-y. What up, Scott? Surprise! - I don't even know where to... - You must be, Abby. Oh shit, sorry, I forgot to introduce you guys. Um... yeah, sorry. It's good to finally meet you. - Heard a lot. - Not all of it's true. How long have you and Miranda been together? Oh, you mean she... didn't talk to you about me in any of your emails together? Three months and some change. That's... that's great. Yeah. So what do you think is true? Actually, Scott, this is the first time we've gotten together, since they started dating. Yeah, I guess that's on me. No, no. We've all been busy. Mhmm. What do you do? I do make up for a local theater company. And, you know, I just started and I really like it. Oh, I... I thought you were wrapped up in the medical scene like the rest of them. Cody said he's seen you at the hospital a lot. I don't mean to pry, Abbey, but I know a good gynecologist, if you... No, no, no. Wow, wow. Yeah, sorry. - Went right through me. - You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Went straight through me. Okay. The fuck's her problem? Shit just got awkward. Oh, fuck. Hey, hey! I saw you walk right past, and... I'm, uh... I'm just not feeling so good. Okay, that's fine, you know, we don't have to stay long. Let's just get through dinner, okay? No, I want you to see your friend. You don't like him, do you? I know, it's just been a few years. He's jetlagged. It's all the questions, isn't it? I'll make sure they lay off. They just really like you, Abbey, and they want to get to know you. I feel like they already know everything about me. They're just being coy. Oh, I haven't told them anything, but, I know you will in your own time. Do they know about your seizures? What? Well, Cody said that thing, and you have your seizures. They're just clique-y. - I don't think... - Scott was talking about that medical shit... Just got me thinking. What about Will, Kristen, Robert? I don't think they'd want me to say. I'm your girlfriend. And they're my best friends. They know about me, don't they? Abbey, I don't even know about you. You're all vague about it. You know what? Fine. Kristen has Ehlers-Danlos, Robert has diabetes, Will has migraines that feel like somebody is fucking drilling into his brain. And I used to have seizures. Seizures, damn it! Everybody has their shit. Is that how you guys all became friends? We all became friends through Scott. He was the one that was in the nurse's office the most. We all met that way through him. That's fucking weird. Weird? Seriously? If anybody's gonna understand what's going on within you, it's gonna be them and me if you just fucking let me. And so this patient's been requesting me all night, all night. Sorry, go ahead. Go ahead. But when he would talk to me, he would use my full name. So of course I'm avoiding him because I know what's coming next. He's what we at the hospital call a "frequent flyer." So there I am, off in 20 minutes, and then here he comes. Butt ass naked, dick swinging... balls flapping, big stupid grin on his face. Hey, is this the... Oh, they haven't heard this one. So he's been coming to the hospital every week for the last two months. He's 300 pounds, clearly never missed a meal in his life... and always naked. So when I tell you that I've seen every inch of him, trust me, I have, inside and out. Oh, no. Yeah, yeah, so, all this time, though, it never clicked with me, but you know who this guy is? An ex-boyfriend? Bingo. Oh, my God. - Who? - HIPAA, Kristen. Anyway... yeah, he was somebody I dated in, like, high school for like a month. I think we made out once. Wow, sounds like you saved yourself for a really long time. Pretty special guy? Oh, he's special, all right. Paranoid schizophrenic. You must have done a number to him back in high school. I was still coming into my powers. You broke him. Wait, how did you break him? We're joking, Abbey. Will had a reputation in high school for being... - A bitch. - Selective. I had high standards, okay? Excuse me. You had high standards? Why didn't he make the cut? He was boring. See... I was, well, I am into the esoteric. And he just didn't get it. You're a nurse. Yeah. Aren't nurses supposed to be all medical and scientific? We are. So how do you reconcile the two then? You can be both. You can do both, personally and professionally. I don't... I don't think you can. I don't think anybody can. She's got you there. How did you break him? Abbey. We're kidding. Well, I don't think it's all that funny. I mean, you can't go around fucking up people's lives and then laughing about it later. I mean... things have fucking consequences. It's like... social genetics. Shit. If you have something to say, we're all friends here. No, no, no. Abbey... Abby doesn't drink, so it's... Yeah, this much is fast. Thanks, Miranda. I think, Abbey thinks that you have the power to drive men crazy. Just this one. So tell us everything. Okay, man. Don't hold out. It's... it's nothing fun, it's just for nausea. Okay, tell us about your trip. Pretty please. Ugh... I guess I should have figured this was coming. Yeah. I guess I'll start... somewhat at the beginning... for Abbey. I went out of the country about a year and a half ago. Right after college. Honestly, you've probably heard all of this from Miranda by now. Yeah, probably not. Towards the end of high school... all of us got pretty deep into this... obscure practice known as Velis Vall. Kristen was actually the first person to find out about it. Finally, some recognition. But, uh... me and Cody were the ones to really take it to the next level. Always. Velis Vall... is mindfulness, meditation... and metamorphosis. It's the idea of being aware of everything and your place within everything and changing yourself. Internally. Externally. Depending upon... how in tune you are. For a bunch of rejects with busted bodies who didn't seem to fit in anywhere, yeah, why not? Also didn't hurt that no one else knew what it was. We made it our own. There wasn't a manual, really. Well, is it a religion? At one point. There was so little out there on it that we didn't know that at the time. That's one of the reasons why I left the country. See... these guys, they've gotten their lives together. They, um... they'd fallen into the flesh. I know... I know that sounds strange, but, that's one of the main tenets of Velis Vall, to... fall into the flesh and... find out what's on the other side. Acceptance followed by - metamorphosis. - Metamorphosis. Yeah. But, like I said, I left the country. I... unlike these guys, I was falling apart in all the wrong ways. But, uh... maybe we can save that for another time. Yeah, man. Of course, Scott. I needed to get away. And I needed to find out more about Velis Vall. We knew the practice originated from somewhere in southern Africa, and I spent... God, I don't even know, months just researching and talking to people. But eventually, I made my way to the Okavango Delta in Botswana. There was this village there, in the swamp. The locals called it... Velis Vall. You can only get there by boat, and only after a lot of begging and palm greasing... because... locals thought the area was cursed. And it was. Velis Vall was this tiny dead village in the middle of a crater on the edge of the swamp. And everything about it is... wrong. Color was off... the crops didn't grow right... the animals were just... wrong. I saw crocodiles that were... inside out and... cheetahs that walked around with their placental sacs hanging out of them. Oh, Jesus. Antelopes that had horns growing out of their stomachs, and... those are just the things I could recognize. This sounds like some kind of scientific marvel. How are you the first person to find this? I'm not. I wasn't. The thing is, the locals don't let you into the area unless you've got... the aura. Unless you're attuned. If you don't got it then you don't go in. And if you try... they kill you. What did you find? Just this... village that looked like a... bomb went off in it. And this... effigy. This... egg. Flesh. It was blooming. To the locals... it was a religion. Not some self-help thing like we made it. The thing is, they weren't worshipping a god. Everything that had happened in that area had been done by humans. Bomb tests, chemical spills, experiments. They were just worshipping the aftermath. And someone packaged it, put it on the internet. And we fell for it. That's... That's why I left the country. And... now I know... that it's all lies. And I feel... free. I know I've been emailing all of you, trying to convince you but I felt like I had to be here tonight to tell you myself. Velis Vall... is tainted. It died in that swamp. And that's where it should have stayed dead. And, we... We didn't know that. But... now we do and now... now... it's time. Now, it's time to bury it. I don't, uh... That's not why you went out there. - That's not why we're... - It's disappointing. No. I appreciate what Scott did. For sure, for sure. But that... that's just the abridged version, right? Mm, for sure. Sorry, girl, this is probably why Miranda didn't want to bring you around us. It gets really intense and weird. Not anymore. I mean, Scott got it figured out for us. I don't fucking buy it. You... We wasted all this time, I mean, you had to come back with something. Just... Just what I told you, I'm not... I'm not trying to fuck with you guys. Not this time. Cody, man, it's cool. I'm sorry, guys... but this is a lot. I just wanted to have a nice dinner. And it is. This is a nice dinner. Look. it's just nice having you back. Seriously. Yeah. I thought I was ready for this, but I... Hey, it's okay, it's fine. Yeah, like... nobody's mad. I just didn't know anyone else was gonna be here. Hey, Miranda's told you about me, hasn't she? One of you. One of me? What? What? What the hell is that supposed to mean? That's fucked up. What are you doing? Miranda, answer me. I had a bad breakup a couple of years ago. And I dated a lot of women... I'll say. Shut up. It was ridiculous. She was hurting. But we meditated on it... and she got through it and she met you. Abbey, I... I'm not trying to start something. No, no, no. It's not your fault. I'm gonna get some water. Fucking genius. You all are looking a little empty. I'm gonna get some refills. No, no. You are our guest. Let us get it. No, it's fine. I want to. I-I need to stretch my legs and... do what needs to be done. Sorry, sorry, I was...- I was in my own world. Are you okay? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm great. I live over there. Okay, just go back there. I'm drunk but... you okay? I'm good. You're drunk. Get home safe. This way. Oh, my God. Miranda! Miranda! Miranda! - What, what? What? - He's...- - Tell me. - He's... he's... He's doing what? What're you doing? We... we already drugged the drinks. Oh, no! She has ovarian cancer. She doesn't know I know, but... we have our ways, don't we? She doesn't know how grateful she'll be when this is all over with. Just... make her take the sickness... so the sickness doesn't take her. She'll fall through the flesh. Abbey. Abbey, Abbey, wake up! Abbey? Abbey, you need to wake up. Get up. Abbey. Abbey. - Abbey. - Fuck you. - Abbey. - Fuck you! Everything is okay, it's fine. Stay back! Stay back! - Listen to me... - Don't touch me! Shut the fuck up and listen to me. Everything I said at dinner... The fuck is that? What is that? Take that off. Take that off right fucking now! There's something in the darkness calling to us! Take it off! Oh, shit. Abbey. Abbey. - What the fuck? - It's okay. It's okay. Abbey, it's gone now. It's okay. It's okay. - You okay? - I don't know... I don't know. What was that? Everything... Everything I said during dinner... it was a lie. Velis Vall... - It's real. - No. - It can't be. - 100-fucking-percent real. - No, no. - The power of it. The god of it... - it's all real. - What the... what the fuck was that about upstairs? What the fuck just grabbed me? Just, please, listen. Just listen to me. It's. All. Real. I left the country, I left the country fully indoctrinated but... when I saw what I saw... There's a reason for faith, Abbey. We are not meant to look behind the curtain. Why... why were you drugging the drinks? - I... I...- - I wasn't drugging the drinks. Not... Not like you think. The drinks? They were already drugged. For this. What I put in the drinks was just meant to... counteract the seed. Seed, it's... You plant a seed of Velis Vall inside you. It's like, um... It's like a... it's like a beacon and it draws it to you... and it finds you, it changes you and what I put in the drinks would have... it would have neutralized the seed, knocked everybody out. - Oh, okay. - But... But for all of that to work, for... for a seed to work, there has to be an idol. It's like a... it's like a locked window that lets you see Velis Vall and Velis Vall see you. But you need the seed to unlock that window. And then... and once you do... then it finds you and then it changes you. No, no, you need to give me the fuck out of here! I am, I will. I'm here because I came back to save them. I get it. They're insane. They're way... way fucking deeper than I was. But even still, I came back to save them. And I tried. I tried emailing them, feeding them bullshit, trying to convince them. But it wasn't enough so here I am. What's wrong with you? The reason I came into the house, and I did... is I think in the garage is an idol. You can't... You can't keep it in here. It saps life wherever it stands. And I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty fucking sure it's in that garage. Kristen and Robert saw me, so I had to stop. But I think if we can get back out there, I think we can... We can destroy it and save... and save them. I don't care what you do, but you need to get me out here right now. I am. I will. We have to get the medicine in your system first. What do you mean? What medicine? Why? Why? What medicine? If we don't... your cancer will take over your body... and you'll become the thing that's killing you. What the fuck? Those morons up there... they don't know that part of it. The part where you become a slave... but it's true. You weren't some sacrificial lamb or anything like that, okay? Miranda loves you so much in her own twisted, fucked up way that she thought that that was somehow a way to save you. No, you know, fuck her. It was never that serious. Let's go, come on. Okay, okay. Listen, listen... Okay we're going to. Okay, we'll... We're going to that right now. You hand me...- Hand me that. Pick up the knife. Bring it up here. - We're going to out, okay? - Okay. I don't know where the fuck this basement came from but I guess this is part of the house, now. - Okay? - Yeah. So, let's... let's go. - We can do this. - Okay. Abbey! Abby! Oh, my God! Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Scott, you did it. Thank you! This is something I've never seen before. Abbey, I know, I know it hurts but Scott knows what he's doing. And this is the purest pain... [distorted growling [guitar plucking Oh. fuck. Let's get you looking decent. Oh, you fucked up. You thought that you were the only ones? You left us, but your journey gave us so much more. Destroy the idol! You didn't come back from Africa alone, Scottie. To see has made you blind. Blindness will make you see. Have faith. What do you think? Bee-ka!
