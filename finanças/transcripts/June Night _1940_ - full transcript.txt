JUNE NIGHT What was that? The seaman upstairs. He has a girl. Never have unemployed boarders. Stop laughing! I'm not laughing. - So you're leaving? - Don't shout. Leaving when the fun is over. Was it that much fun? You bitch! Clamp, nurse. Forehead, nurse. The bullet was near her heart. Adrenaline. Quickly, nurse! OPERATING ROOM Do you know who she is'? The tall redhead from the pharmacy. Is she dead? Hush. He's speaking to the doctor! I want to know if the girl's decided to live or die. I must know whether to charge him with murder or attempted murder. That's what you wanted to know? Yes. She'll survive. Yes. Goodbye. This operation must be reviewed in the Medical Journal. Yes . Now and then an old sawbones learns that he's still useful. Sleeping again? Happy youth. Yes, if it wasn't for your youth and for sleeping well, you'd never have made it. If only I could get away, Doctor. I've always been unhappy here. If only I could go to a city where nobody knows me. I could start working. So I wouldn't have to think. Yes, but you must stay here a while longer anyway. Yes, I know. The trial. Could I ask you a favor? Go see Nils. You can visit him, Doctor. Yes. I'm sure that I can. Any special message for the would-be murderer'? Don't call him that. Well... Tell him... That he needn't worry about me. If I'm to speak to him you have to tell me what actually happened. No. I can't. Tell Nils not to talk too much. That will only make things worse. It can't be dangerous to tell him that. Asklund. Berggren. I'm a doctor at the hospital. Well... Miss Norbiick sent me. She'll be alright? I didn't mean... She's in no danger. It's more my doing that she's alive than yours. YES... But... Maybe I've given her something too. Something you don't have, Doctor. And that would be? May I ask where you and the young lady met? The city library, of course. She was the only one in town who understood a poor guy like me. She was like a long voyage to new ports. And the way she walked. Not just with her feet, like other Swedish girls, but with her hips. You're an intellectual, Doctor, you know what I mean. I'm damned if I do. Aren't you an unemployed seaman? I am. I sailed before the mast for three years. A man isn't a hoodlum just because he's working class. Do you know the worst thing that can happen to you in life? No. To wish to give to somebody and be rejected. So you came here to laugh, like her'? No, of course not. I don't think we have anything more to say to each other. Except that Miss Norback said to tell you not to talk so damned much. She's well now, so you can't avoid meeting her. In court. Mr. Asklund, you've heard the police report. Why did you have the gun that night? If you must know, I was planning to kill myself, not her. I loved her. And she loved me. But unless you graduate, you're nothing. She grew distant, said she only wanted to be friends. Nothing more. But once you get started on that, it's hard to quit. Right, your honor'? At least not if you're a man and in love. Right? At first I thought there was somebody else and I got jealous. But I was wrong. She was suddenly so polished and educated. So that evening, I planned to shoot myself in front of her. But then she laughed. Just a little, with a wry smile. And that's when the red mist came over me, and I pulled the trigger. Now. No photography in this courtroom! Give me the film. Let us hear from Mrs. Cronsioo.. Such small town behavior. - I gave him the wrong plate. - Gurkan! Witness Mrs. Cronsioo. Good day, your honor. Kerstin Norback has lived with you since childhood. - Have you heard of the accused? - No! Kerstin has always been a moody girl. Often wild and unruly. Sometimes reserved, spending all her time reading novels, and then... Excuse me, the court asks if you know about her affairs with the accused. Or anything relating to motive for the crime. - Do you know him? - No, thank God. But I've known other admirers of hers. - Other admirers? - Indeed. Many have run after her. I couldn't see what they saw in her. Well-educated men, too. One handsome man was a drawing teacher. He wanted her for a model. I told him it was shameful to turn her head. And there was a notary. He worked here at the courthouse! But of course, you neither heard nor saw anything. Blind, right? Excuse me, I'm just saying as it is. And there was kissing in the stairwell-. I saw and heard it all: the door was half open. Fortunately, he had to move away. But as far as this Asklund goes... It was a total surprise. This time, I was the blind one. She must have sneaked out the window. Or maybe had a key made. But worst of all was that she lied to me. When she said she was working late at the pharmacy I called to check on that. She wasn't there. I guess that's when she was with him. That murderer. What I can't understand is what men saw in her. I tried to raise her as a decent, humble girl. So that I would not be shamed in front of the public and in the papers. But I can see that I have failed. Miss Norback. Miss Norback, you have not given the police any information. I must say that the accused may suffer if you remain silent instead of telling us everything that happened. It was my fault. Not his. The fault was mine. I just wanted some adventure. It happened to be Nils Asklund. - Shameful - Hush. That's what I say. Shush. I didn't realize it was the wrong kind of adventure. But girls do this. Continue. I realized suddenly that it was... that it was over. I didn't feel anything. Neither tenderness, affection, nor disgust. Nothing. I'm sorry that Nils is on trial. I hope that he will be acquitted. If that can't be, then I beg the court to be lenient. I'm alive, after all. Kerstin! I ordered you to stop that! Try to get a picture of her on the stairs. Stop him! Take the film! THE WOUNDED SWAN SINGS Switchboard. One moment, please. You have a line. Hello? The Daily News wants to speak with the Opera Manager. Thank you. Hi, Nickan. Is the boss in? Seen the front page? No, he's not come in. He's out then? - We expect him any minute. - Good. - Was she pretty? - You bet. "The Wounded Swan Sings. " What was she wearing? What was he like? He wasn't my type. But you should have seen her. Switchboard. One moment. Look. Her face is naked, you can see her whole character. I'll tell you more later. See you tonight, right? - I'm going in. See you. - See you tonight! The Opera Manager. Switchboard. One moment. Mr. Berg for you. Hello. Hi. Well, here I am. The boss isn't in yet? No, he'll be here any minute. Tired of the small town already? “The Wounded Swan". Not bad. Well. The girl was all right. No beauty maybe, but damned attractive all the same. - What's the circulation today? - Quiet! Smokey's coming. What is this? What kind of tasteless yellow journalism is going on behind my back in my own newspaper'? What a surprise to come home to. Isn't there anyone here who can clean that whelp's diapers before they... There you are, you conceited bum! Since when do reporters decide policy? Next the doorman or shareholders will tell me what to think. I've done an editorial on juvenile delinquency and promiscuity based on that filthy affair in Gustafssund. The best article I've ever written. How can I publish it now? Above that whelp's “wounded swan“? Garbage reporting! Well, here she is. Gurkan didn't get the picture in time. Good lord. What an interesting face. And mysterious. No mystery. Just a girl who played foolishly with a boy. The boy couldn't take a joke, and... bang. Wrong! It was no love affair. She wanted a way out of a small-town cultural wasteland. She lost her way and... bang. No, she represents a rare but antisocial factor in Sweden's peaceful society. It was passion. Fatal passion. Did you see the Evening Post? They're all over us: "Romance of Violence“, “Collapse of Traditions", “Soft Justice" and "Juvenile Delinquency“. What? 'Romance of Violence“, “Juvenile Delinquency“? They don't know juveniles. The girl is pure as an angel, whatever she's done. Young, passionate... A new Juliet. A child of love and death. Romance of violence! I'll write a new piece in defense of youth! Youth shall have its day, as we have had ours. Youth ! Yes, the Editor is in his room now. - Call Willy Wilson. - You took so long! What did they say? Fanfare all the way. Smokey actually fawned over me. We'll go to a movie and then drink a toast to “The Wounded Swan". She deserves it. You sound like you love her. Love? Don't be silly. It was my first big assignment! You'll come with me? I guess. I'll see you at 7. Bye! Daily News. Mr. Wilson's line is busy. There. It's all fixed. You start at the Swan Pharmacy next month. - Is it really called Swan? - Yes. Why? Oh, of course. "The Wounded Swan". Silly journalists. As I said, it's all settled. I'm so happy. Thank you so much. But, there is one condition for the job. You must change your name. The pharmacist doesn't want scandal mongers in his drugstore. He is the only one who will know who you really are. So. Will you agree to this? I've already thought of changing my name. And my character. I see. And what will you call yourself? Well, it might sound a bit silly, but I was thinking Sara Nordana. I was baptized Sara-Christina and my grandfather's farm was Nordana. Do you think it sounds silly? Sara Nordana... It sounds a little romantic. But why not? Yes . Well, now we will go and pack. Thank you. And promise one thing. No more adventures like this one. Ever. I'll try not to. Goodbye. Miss Nordana? One more thing. Your wound is not yet completely healed. Go to Dr. Tillberg in Stockholm. Have him look at it. Give him this. Well. That's all, then. You're cute today, Asa. And happy. - Is that because you're rushed? - I like being rushed. It's silly to complain about too much to do. Things are easier when you have a lot to do. Asa... - There. Put this in your pocket. - Thank you. - It didn't hurt, did it? - No, nurse. You know your job. - Thank you. - Goodbye. Good afternoon. - Asa, we're both off tonight. - No ﬂirting with the nurse, Doctor. - Upplandsgatan 35. - No. Norr Mélarstrand... You've been acting strange lately. I thought you were avoiding me. Sometimes, you just want to be alone. Is that strange? Von Bremen. Yes, right away. So why tonight, then? We get along so well. You've got three minutes to think it over. - Professor Tillberg? - No, his office is down the hall. Excuse me, but I have a letter for him. If you'll wait a moment, the nurse will handle this. It's your turn now, Sven. You're starting to feel at home here. If you'd like to go in first, I don't mind waiting. I don't mind at all. Nothing to be afraid of. The nurse is nice. Thank you. I'm not afraid... that it will hurt. Are you on your own today? - Mom's at work. - What a clever boy. - Who is next? - The lady can go. I will wait. I have a letter here. For Professor Tillberg. Come wait in here. The professor wants to see you. Please wait in here. Come on in. Asa? Your three minutes are up. I don't know. I have to go now. And your name? Sara Nordana. Who treated you previously? Dr. Berggren in Sundsvall. You can remove your clothing in there. You have a letter regarding Miss Nordana, a referral from Sundsvall. Put it on my desk. And ask her to come in. All right, Miss Nordana. Lie down there. “Chest wound, heart lesion, still has probe, bandage necessary. " Okay, remove your slip so that I can see. There's nothing to be afraid of. Hurry up. Oh... What is this? Who did you say sent you? How did you get this? My doctor said it would heal soon, but that you should look at it. Before I remove the bandage. I asked you how you got this. It's an abscess. Such nonsense. Abscess! Why are you lying? Turn a little. Right. A bullet wound. From Sundsvall, you said? You're from Gustafssund. So it was my friend Berggren who patched you up. Does that hurt? - Or here? - No. It's healing well. Put a new bandage on it, nurse. Come back again in six months and we'll look at it. But... don't lie next time. Do you understand, Little Miss Incognito? But she's... - I'm so silly. - The Professor is brusque at times. It was silly of me to lie. Thank you. If you knew how awful it is to be questioned all the time... Thanks, I can manage myself. We'll need your address. I'm staying at a hotel. I just arrived in Stockholm the other day. I've not found a place to live. I can help with that. There's a boarding house called Cosy. Two of my friends live there. Cosy. It sounds homey. I'm done, we can leave together. I'll just change. Wait for me here. I'll keep your secret, Sara Nordana. Just wait for me here. What's the rush? I'm going with a patient. She's not feeling well. How long will it take? - All day. - All day? Until tonight. Who is she? Interested? Or just curious? Well, well, you're all having a good time. Hi! - Hello. - Sorry for barging in, but I've got a newcomer here. Sara Nordana. Sells aspirin at The Swan pharmacy. This... I'm Jane Jacob, sales clerk at Gunilla Studio. I do my best to mitigate the poor taste of my customers. Welcome, Miss Nordana. This is my cousin, Nickan Dalin. Operator at the Daily News. I hope you enjoy living with us. How odd. I'm sure I've seen you before. Impossible. Miss Nordana has never been to Stockholm before. The landlady gave her a closet to sleep in, so please take care of her. - Of course. - Your friends are my friends. Let's celebrate with some home-brewed poison from my personal pharmacy. You'll ruin her right away! She's not as sinful as she seems. A boarding house is surprisingly nice. No, we're the ones who are nice. And now, girls, since I'm youngest... I propose we use first names, so we can be honest. - Jane. - Asa. - Nickan. - Sara. That's done. Shall we continue the hypocrisy, or discuss men now? Can't you help her unpack first? I will. I love unpacking. Watch out, Sara, she'll grab everything she lays her hands on! Where ever did you find that odd pill-pusher? Jane, try to control your curiosity for once. It's not easy. Curiosity is my best resource. But I understand: Professional duty. From the “gone astray" ward? - Oh, quick thinking. - You want me to join in slum charity? And you want me in a red bonnet! It would suit you. Speaking of clothes: her hat was decidedly small-town! Do you only think of clothes? The more I know of people, the more I like their clothing! Unpacking didn't take long. Is her name really Nordana? Why shouldn't it be? Right. It's such a romantic name. I'm sure I've seen her before. What's wrong? Has something happened? No, I just missed you. Just think, I have you again! Yes, you were reluctant when I asked you to come. I want to stay with you tonight. May I? “To belong together and naught else, no home, no mundane worries own. " - Have you been waiting long? - Yes. Imagine, waiting for your lover. He comes, and fires a shot... which touches the heart, that strange heart. What are you talking about? You wondered who that girl was. The one in the waiting room. Yes . Who was she? She's the one who was shot by her lover in Gustafssund. Oh, was she? That's why... Why what? I thought I recognized her. Oh? You did? From the newspaper. The papers must have it wrong. She doesn't seem like a vamp. She just seems frightened. - We had dinner together. - You did? Yes, and she told me a little about herself. People do confide in me, you know. She seemed so shy, and the Professor scared her to death. - And you took her under your wing. - Yes. You should have seen her eyes. I did. So, you'll have to let me meet her. Sure. Oh, Stefan! What is it now, sweetheart? I'm so silly. It would never occur to you to shoot me. Of course not. - But she's been loved, at least. - You have p retentions. - You're laughing at me. - Yes, I am. Do you think it's wrong of me to want to stay with you? Is that the preacher's daughter again? - Stefan? - Yes, darling. I was kidding. I will never let you meet her. WOMAN WITH GRAY COAT ADDRESS? C/O MYSELF Hello? Did you find the address, Nurse? No, there's no Kerstin Norback. In Tillberg's journal, on the 5th? No, nothing all week. I see. I must have made a mistake. Thank you. Goodnight. What will you have'? Well, I think I'll have... - Send it to me. - Which one? Sara] Are you eating out today too? There's room for us. ls there a waiter here? I'll call in the prescription to the Swan. You can pick it up later. This is Dr. von Bremen. I have a prescription. Yes. Dr. von Bremen. Yes. Three teaspoons daily. Post number'? Can I come in? Sure! Come in and sit down. At last. The whole city has the ﬂu. I've sold a million aspirins today. Glad you came. I lie here like Diana on a bed of moonlight. What a life, completely without lovers. Just myself to think about. I wonder how long that will go on? What do you think? Don't you like it? Sometimes. Hey, how many lovers have you had? Don't be shy. In my circle, we're used to having lots of them. - Lovers? Who says that? - Nobody. I just think it's odd that someone as "distant" as you ends up here. Everything happens to me by accident. I like the name: COSY- It sounds appealing. All my life, I wanted only the comforts of home. Typical. You come from far away and end up here by accident. For me, it's like you were born on the train that brought you to Stockholm. Why don't you talk about yourself like everyone else? There's nothing to tell. Don't, if you don't want to. My childhood was cheap and ugly. I was always cold. And I wanted to get away. Poor girl. Come here and sit with me. I'll tell you a secret, but you must promise not to tell anyone. The worse your childhood, the better your life is later. There's some justice. - That's almost a view of life. - And you? I think we have to look after ourselves and not hurt others. It's not much, but I manage neither one nor the other. Daily News No, he's not come in yet. Daily News. I can't tell you. Good evening, Dalin. What is going on? Nervous? Meeting someone for a movie and Nilsson hasn't relieved you? - Is she coming? - Yeah. Nilsson has become unforgivably sloppy since she married Fritjof. Nothing but Fritjof. Police? Awful! Police? Lieutenant? Oh, he's not come yet. - Twelve past seven. - Daily News. Thirteen past seven. You won't make it now. Bye, Dalin. Bitch. Willy, don't go. Don't go. She'll be here soon. Fourteen past. I may well go insane. Taxi! Daily News. One moment. Daily News. No, he isn't in. Send a taxi to the Daily News as fast as possible. I wish he'd call so I can explain! Daily News. Hello! Is this Willy? Oh, my apologies, Education Minister. One moment. I'll connect you with the editor. Hi. Anything today? Fritjof's been home all day today. We pickled the herring. He gave me one little herring after another. He's a lovely man. He loves my pickled herring. - Bitch! - What? What's wrong with you? You knew I was in a hurry. Tomorrow, I'm telling the boss! I dare you! Chasing every man here. You're the one who should watch her step. I know what you're up to, kissing them on the stairs. You should be ashamed. They're just playing with you too! - Blah, blah, blah! - Thank God I have Fritjof. Amusement park? No, it's not. Quite the contrary. Mirror Theater. Fast! I'll never be mean on the phone again if he asks me tonight. I forgot the police lieutenant! - What a wonderful evening, Willy. - You think so? Such a nice movie and dinner. You're so pretty. You remind me of Kerstin Norback. I thought I saw her on the street, but that's impossible. What were you going to tell me? I got a raise! 200 a month. To write a column. That's great! Now I can leave home and get my own place. We could look for an apartment together. You want to? A bachelor apartment, that's the life. You can come over some evenings and make tea for me. - Right? - Maybe. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Let me out. - That'll be 2 crowns. - Thank you. - Goodnight. - Oh, no! No, Willy. Nickan, I'm crazy about you. Let me come up. - No! - Yes, I must kiss you. For real. Just up the stairs. What are you afraid of? Everyone does it. It's not dangerous. Nickan... At least say that you love me. Do you? I can't leave you tonight. You drive me crazy. We'll be quiet. Let me come up with you. Don't be silly. No! You know I share a room. Nickan, wait! - Nickan, Nickan! - No! Leave me alone. You don't mean it anyway! Nickan, Nickan! Ah, you are home now. Is that you, Nickan? Are you crying? Didn't things go as you wanted? He's a real creep. He just wanted to seduce me! And I loved him so much! He got a raise, too. But he doesn't care about me at all. Not at all. He was terrible. Imagine if I had my own room. All to myself. Like you do. I don't know what would have happened. If only he loved me. Don't cry. Nickan. He's not worth it. No, he's not. I never want to see him again! I'll show him. I'm a decent girl and not... Now I know what they mean when they say men are loose and fresh. And I argued with Nilsson because of him. I'll buy her chocolates. Sara, do you understand men? Maybe he really cares about someone else and wants to marry her'? Maybe that odd girl in Gustafssund who was shot? He was really taken with her. That “wounded swan... - I hate her! I hate her! - Do you really? I wish she would have died. Why should she live and make others unhappy? I don't know, but you shouldn't hate her. When you're 19 and work all clay, don't spend your nights in hate. Go lay down and sleep. I can't sleep either. Go get your pillow and blanket. You can sleep on the sofa. I'll talk to you. Can I lie here instead? - Maybe if I read, I will sleep. - Come on, then. "Glorious is death when at the front courageously you fall“ "Fall in battle for your native land, for your city and your home“ REMARKABLE HEART OPERATION AT GUSTAFSSUND HOSPITAL That case sure has your attention. Don't be silly. I'm a doctor, of course I'm interested in fine operations. Imagine, holding a bloody heart. The blood vessels and muscles are put back into their places. So many words to explain away your curious interest. Hey, Asa? Yes . I've requested a month of leave. I was thinking of driving around for a while. Will you come along this time? No. Pretend to be your wife for hotel managers and chambermaids? You know I can't lie. As you wish. - Stefan? - Yes? I've been thinking. I've been silly toward you. How So? You know when I wouldn't let you meet Kerstin Norbiick? That was just jealousy. And I'm ashamed of it. Of course you can meet her. I like her so much. She's become so happy and nice. I'm sure you'll like her too. Sara? Why are you here? The professor said to come back in 6 months. It's time. You needn't bother him now. He's so busy these clays. I told him I removed the probe and the wound is healed. So you can go. Thank you. I'll leave. Please hurry. I'm so rushed. Goodbye. - Stefani - Yes? I know I said I would introduce you. - But it's so hard to do. - Excuse me, Nurse? Can you tell me how to give these drops? Sara. Here you go. Hello again. I'm here because I'm ashamed. - Ashamed? - I was silly at the hospital. I just thought you were out of sorts. Is something wrong? There's something I must tell you. I'm engaged to Stefan von Bremen. We'll get married as soon as he has a suitable appointment. Engaged! Really? - Yes. To Stefan von Bremen. - Who... - The doctor at the clinic? - Yes, exactly. I thought he was interested in you. He asked after you many times. I got jealous. And I couldn't help saying so. - He's in Professor Tillberg's ward? - Yes. He saw you there the first time, and then today... - He's blond. - Yes. Leans forward a little. - He's tall. - Yes, and beautiful eyes. That's him. A shame I don't have a photo. But I do have one in my purse! This is him as a young boy. Isn't he wonderful? That little self-assured, spoiled look. I think he's always been spoiled. Yes, it shows. I was jealous, but I'm glad I told you. You must meet him. Why don't we all have dinner? No. Thank you, but... I don't... I don't know. What is it? Are you thinking of that seaman? Yes, I just thought about him. He's your fate, just as Stefan is mine. You're lucky, Asa. You make people happy. I just make them unhappy. Can you tell me where to find the Swan Pharmacy? You wish to visit a pharmacy. Let me ask, why do you wish to visit a pharmacy? A pharmacy! When all around you is the aura of a June night in Stockholm! With its wonderful magic. There is nothing more seductive! Do you know about the famous Roman Saturnalias? No? No? Saturnalia was held once a year to celebrate the return of light. Everything was happiness and joy. Slaves and masters drank together. Secret desires ﬂourished during the day. Or rather, the night! Next morning, all was forgotten. So... June nights are our Saturnalia. Enjoy its pale lies, for tomorrow, all is forgotten. Goodnight! The one reason to visit the Swan Pharmacy would to buy soda water for your drink. There you go. Goodnight. Let's go, driver! THE SWAN PHARMACY AFTER HOURS SERVICE BELL Nils! No! Kerstin, did I scare you? Open up, I just want... How did you get here? I had one more year, but they let me out and I came straight here. So I came right away. I must speak to you. No. I don't want to. Well, maybe I owe it to you. Wait a moment. Kerstin! No... I won't do anything. I came lo apologize for all the trouble I caused you. - But when I see you... - I'll do what I can for you. You need money, I'll... No, I told you why I came. Kerstin... You had to change names because of me. It was hard to find you. Not until tonight... don't you see? I sat there alone for so long and saw only you. You and the sea. And now you are here! - Don't touch me. - Kerstin, don't... My name isn't Kerstin. I'm another person and I like it that way. I was irresponsible, I know. But I tried to make up for it! Are you going to persecute me? Will I never be free? I'm not blaming you. I'm not asking for anything. Why are you so upset? You acted rashly, you should know we don't always know what we do! Isn't this wound enough? Stop! I'm calling for help. I see. You love someone else. Yes. I love someone else. Now go away. Go! Go! You don't need to call the police. - Hello? - Asa? Asa, come to the Swan. I need help. I'm sick. What is the matter!? Please come... - Hello? - Hello, Stefan? - Yes, Asa. Come right away! Something's wrong with Sara. Sara? Where? The Swan. She's on night duty. Hello? - Hello? - Taxi! Sara? It's me, Asa! Sony, Nurse. I scared Kerstin. She's in there. She won't let me touch her. I'm Nils Asklund. Wait here. We'll talk later. I've called for the doctor. - Sara, darling. - Asa... I'm numb. I can't straighten out. Try to relax now. There, there. Let it go. I called Stefan. He'll be here any minute. - Is she alive? - Yes. It seems benign. I was scared when she called. Something to do with that seaman. He scared her. She had some kind of heart attack. It's good you came. She's in there. And the seaman? I have things to do here. Go in to her. Are you Stefan? Yes . So you are Stefan. Yes . It's me. It was good of you to come. I'm calmer now. What are you laughing about? - She's better now. - I see. I forgot what I was going to say. I'll start over. How do you feel? Fine. That too. This is the Swan. Send a relief for Miss Nordana. She's ill. I'll talk to you later. Stay out of the way until she's gone. She'll be right out. Thank you. It's nice of you to help me. Strange that we should meet like this. I have such a silly heart. So weak. - Can you make it home now? - Of course, Asa. Stefan will go with you. - I'll stay until your relief arrives. - Thank you, that's so kind. Come on now. Take good care of her, Stefan. - Is she very sick? - No, mostly scared, I think. I swear, I only wanted to talk to her. You'll have to talk to me now. - I cause so much trouble. - There, there. How's your heart? Better? Better. It feels good. What a June night! Music to my ears, girls. Bottoms up! - I think I'll have a brandy. - No, Willy. No more! Aw, let him. - Oh, no! - Oh, yes! I suggest that we get our big writer a taxi so that he can go home. No, he can look after himself. You, my little dove. I'm going to stay with you. - No, no. - But I like you. But I want to stay with you tonight. - Out with you! - Are you jealous, Nickan? Leave! What are you...? Sara, with a man! At this hour? That's Asa's Stefan. Look at that. My wounded swan from Gustafssund. - Can't you see she's sick? - Wait just a moment. Lovely Kerstin Norback. Welcome to this sinful city! Shut up, you creep! Show me to her room. - She's sick! - Of course, come on! - Oh no, I have to see this. - Willy! - What's wrong? - Heart attack. She was frightened. - Don't let him in! - At least let me say... Why can't they leave me alone? Calm down now. You could have another attack! Don't touch me! - She works at the Swan Pharmacy? - Yes. What a headline! Go home, Willy. You're drunk. I'd get cold sober for less! This will be a sensational article! - Where are you going? - The paper, of course! Now I can use that photo! This is terrible. Shameful How can someone...? How did he get here? Help me! They're after me! There, there. Nobody's coming after you. Who are you afraid of? They're out there. Nils! And the man in the stairwell! Nils, is he the one? I was scared, so I called Asa. And then he showed up. Everyone wants to hurt me! No. Not everyone. You can't understand. Nobody understands. I am... all alone in this world. Tell me, then there will be two. I'll understand. There's nothing to tell. I tell it so poorly. But I will try. I'm exhausted now. I was so silly at the pharmacy. I was so lonely. And so romantic. I hated everything there. School friends who had parents. I had nobody. Teachers you always had to be thankful for. My horrible clothes. I hated that gossipy, ugly town. You get mean when you are always tense. - Do you? - Yes. Then one night, I met Nils. He was alone too. He fell in love with me. He told me about all those things you dream about: Windless nights. The blinding sun. The funnel in the trade winds. And fat black women, the whites of their eyes like mother-of-pearl. Did you like him very much? Yes . Why should I deny it? He was the first person I ever cared about. I was grateful for that. And so I wanted to give him something. And then? Then? We were too different. It sounds silly and mean, but he said things wrong, like "musicians". He said everything wrong. Not just words, but ideas, too. Then I thought that I'd given enough. I couldn't spend my life with him. You can't force yourself to like someone. And tonight, I felt like I'd rather die than let him touch me again. It's all over now. Where can I go? I can't stay here after that man told them who I am! You poor girl. What? What shall we do now? We? Are you afraid of people, Sara? Sara, listen. Come away from here. With me. You don't know me. And you don't know me. The risk is mutual. Don't toy with me. I might take you seriously. I am serious, Sara. Would you? Do you want to? Don't say anything. Listen to me first. I can't promise you anything. It may be only an adventure. This is sudden. An hour ago, we had not even met. But I know that I've waited a long time for you. Do you want to? Asa... Yes. I know. But she'll manage. She manages everything, for herself and others. If I tell her about us, she will understand. Maybe. Do you think me cruel? I've become that way tonight. You are so beautiful. Shall I tell you more? Yes . Tell me. I've thought about you so much. You have? We've just met. I've seen you everywhere. Just your imagination. A wishful dream. When you pass someone, something happens. They become another person. Don't look so skeptical. You get men to think strange and dangerous thoughts. Your little heart. Are you careful with it? Yes . It's become a habit. I don't notice it myself. I have a scar. - I want to kiss you. - No. Not today. Say it, Sara. Say that you want me. But you don't know anything about me. I've made such a mess of things. Don't I? I know you stir my fantasy. That's enough for me. Will you come along? Yes . I knew you would. - Do you have a baptismal paper'? - In the top drawer of the dresser. - Why do you want it? - For a passport. To the land of adventure. I have a month off from the hospital. We can leave tomorrow night. Try to sleep now. I'll call you in the morning. - Stefan? - Yes? You are so tall. Come back soon. THE SWAN AT THE "SWAN" - ls Mr. Wilson here? - No. I've come for Mr. Wilson's article. The editor asked me m get it. It's that one, there. The editor asked me to get this. - Thanks. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Come in. JOHANSSON EDITOR-IN-CHIEF What is it? You know I don't like to be disturbed. The phone is bad enough. - Is this decent? - What the hell is this? I just asked if it was decent! I see. Where did you get this? They were type-setting it. No. It's not decent. But what right do you have to interfere in editorial matters? Her reputation will be ruined. Right. The article won't be printed. Goodnight. Send Wilson in to me right away. Thanks, Nilsson! I'm ready now. - Thanks for your help. - You're welcome. Now I'm off to my Fritjof. Look! Switchboard. Yes? Mr. Wilson has finished with you. You think I don't know? What a newspaper, edited by switchboard operators! She can talk all she wants. I've clone my bit in any case. Next time, I'll wear my girdle next to my skin and my panties on top. No. You shouldn't wear a girdle. Fritjof says men hate... you know. Does he love you just as much? Yes. Abnormally so. No, I won't say it. I'm going home. Call for a taxi for Mrs. Nilsson. All right. You're qualified. You've got a nose for news. You have a good turn of phrase. But you lack taste, my boy. You see, that girl was once interesting and pathetic. She represented a particular type: Passion that follows its own destiny. Then it was good to write about her, but no more than one time. Once more would be persecution. It would be tasteless and tactless. A newspaper man must have tact. You're too young, too green and too conceited. And cruel. As is youth. But you'll learn. That's all I had to say, so that we understand each other. I hope you understand me. Thanks for your help. Are You happy now? If you behave like a rascal, you'll be treated like a rascal. What have I done? I've clone my job. You publish a paper filled with recipes, christenings, statue unveiling s and a few literary articles! It will fold within a week! What the public wants is murder, robbery, war and misery. It has to be sensational for them to read more than the headlines. Other people's misery, that's what they like with their morning coffee. Reporters are no worse than the public makes us. Call me a rascal, if you wish. Goodbye. No. Nothing. Looks like poor Willy didn't get his big headline. He's a rat. Good morning. Sara, how are you today? I hope Stefan took good care of you. I just wanted to tell you everything is alright. I spoke with that Asklund. You can relax now. He won't bother you again. In fact, he got a job on a ship and will be away for a long time. He won't be back any time soon. Neither scandal nor danger, Kerstin Norback. Maybe I've exaggerated. It could happen to anyone on a light June night. Shall we unpack again? Were you planning to leave, Sara? Asa, I want to talk to you. No. Not now. I have to get to work. The main thing is that you're well again. Goodbye. Asa, sorry to bother you, but there's something I must tell you. Something to do with Sara? Yes, in a way. Do we have to stand in the stairway? Can't we go somewhere? What I have to say is important. There are people up there. If it's important, you can tell me here. I wanted to tell you... I'm going away with Sara tonight. - Going away? Where? - She can't stay, that man is after her. She has to leave. As do I. She's going with me. How can I explain here? Nils Asklund won't bother her, he's gone. It's too late to change it now. We can't help it. I know I am being rotten to you. But I'm too young to settle down with an unwinnable hand of solitaire. I've felt it coming. Go now. I don't want to hear any more. Just go. I don't think I want to see you again. Asa... I'm sorry. There is so much I could explain. No, just go. There's nothing more to say. As you wish. Goodbye. How are you? Fine, thanks. Are you scared? No. I've got nothing to lose. I'm afraid. Afraid of losing you. You didn't ask where we're going. You told me. To the land of adventure. What will we three do now? It looks as if I'll have to keep up appearances here. Do you think I'll fall in love again? I don't think you can avoid it. But what if you can't trust a man? Can you trust a girl? Look at us poor girls. Always trouble with men. Whether we have one or not. I'll tell you exactly what will happen to us. Come here. Wait. I think we'll close the windows first.
