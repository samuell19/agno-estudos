June 1991 Yugoslavia falls apart. First night of a forgotten truck. A secret place. Specially made. Neither God nor Allah would find it, huh? As if a magician made it. I trust you. But, if you insist... You also get a bonus. -You're more than fair. From Cobe. -A bonus? There's no need. A bonus for you, too. Compliments of Veljo. Brothers, thank you and cheers. Why'd you kill us, you dirty bastards!? Shame on you! -Shut the fuck up! You kiss and stab at the same time!? My guts, they're all spilled out. Hold on, don't be a sissy! Oh, poor me, I just got the limo. I put them all back in. I'll live. No chance. Here, fuck your Kraut car. It's enough you killed me, but why scratch my Carl? Look, these guys are finished! What a mess! Cute guy! Like he's alive! Don't get upset. We can't help them. But, they might help us. We've got more cash than the government. What should we do now? -I got an idea. Let's open a club somewhere, on the coast, far away. We'll leave Hooker St. forever. THE RED COLOURED GREY TRUCK My room is too small. There's no place for lies. All that's important is within me. This is not a place for us... 'Good morning, pretty boy!' Ratko Cvoro! Still not ready? Nutcase! 3 years for stealing trucks. Just for joy rides! You don't get it. -Seems he doesn't wanna go out. Crazy! Totally! Certified! What's the word for it? You mean colour blindness? it's something else. I'm ready. Doc, all the best. You too, Rambo. Don't abuse Doc too much. -Fuck you, asshole. And lay off the trucks! From the spring, two paths spread apart... Watch out, which one you take, my friend. Suzanna Medenica! Slovenian police... Controls the airports since this morning. What will happen to my house in Poreƒç? The one next to Restaurant Anchor. Well, Suzanna... You're pregnant. That's impossible! It must be a mistake! No, it's not! When can I have an abortion? - In 3 weeks. Are you crazy? What am I going to do? Is abortion what you want? What are you talking about? -it's up to you. To Dubrovnik, are you nuts? Where's my money? -You see what's happening? Country's falling apart. War may break out. -I don't give a shit! Where's my money?! -it's in a safe place. You drank up 2000 marks? I invested it in General's private bank. In a year, you'll have 6240 marks. In a year I'll have 6240 dicks. You stupid... I'll draw, sing, do anything, but I'm leaving. Over my dead body. Planning any more kids? I'm the one too many! I'll have the army police arrest you! Don't get killed till you give me my money back. And the audience started cheering... Come on, Bruce Lee, strike him, Bruce Lee... Don't let the scum-bags live... Faggot! Join us, babe! Bastard! Oh my, what will I do now?! Good. -What's good, you moron?! You're not dead. -What? -You didn't die. You disappointed? -Not at all. Good. Better than good - great! If you died, I'd be totally fucked up. Fucked up? I'm fucked up even when I run a dog over. You'll be fucked up when I call the cops. Please, don't. Let's move away. Chill out. You're fine, it's just this little, here... Shit! It may leave a scar! It's nothing. You could've died! You moronic idiot! -Stop it, girl! Fuck! You clumsy fool! If you don't want the cops, drive me to the coast. No way! I never pick up anyone! What's your trip, man? Why are you driving in your socks? I feel the pedals better. That's not mine. The truck's not mine. Where are we going? -To Dubrovnik. -Dubrovnik? Is there a problem? -I couldn't care less. What are you driving? A truck. Mercedes Benz, 1959, B type, 165 HP. I mean, what are you carrying? -Oh, that... No idea. If I lived 1,000 years... My whole life would fit into a day If I lived 1,000 years... My whole life,"would fit into a day" A single call changes all. What is it? Speak! Maybe you got a concussion. Not on the seat covers! Want me to hold your head? I'll kill you. -Good. Oh my Bosniaaa... beautiful and faaair I can't stand it any more! -What!? -I can't hold it! What?! -Quick, I need to pee! I'll stop. -I can't pee anywhere, you Bosnian peasant! You can go behind a bush! I'm not one of your cowgirls. Take me to a loo! Just don't get us killed! -I'll show you who's a peasant! Fuck you, moron! What's your name? -Boris... What's up, Boris, you been captured? Yes, we are. Are you terrified? -Yes, we are. Fuck! Why is this battle being fought? No idea. As far as I can tell, They, kind of, want to break away, We, kind of, won't let them. I feel shitty. -I'll help you, just tell me how? Shall I get you an ice cream? You are some moron. But, it's nice of you. 0k, get me an ice cream. -Which one? I hate making choices. I'll take this red one. Which one? You have to show me. You don't see it? -I'm colour blind. I can't recognize colours. it's all black and white. You're bullshitting me? -I swear on Tito. It's like in the song: it's a black-and-white world. Ice boy! Over here! -Nothing but turbo-folk junk! What sick fucks listen to this?! Stop dragging me! -You want us killed? Because I don't like their crap music?! You don't understand. Kiss - my - ass. I am Ratko the Bosnian dork, all this around me is a black-and-white world... What are you doing? -Chucking my shitty shoes. You are crazy, throwing away such nice sandals. What colour are my toenails? -I don't know. What colour is the truck? -Grey, like everything else. I thought about it a lot. -And? Maybe you should see it my way. Grey. But things have colours. -How can you tell? We who see colours are many. You colour-blind are few. That's why we're normal, and you're sick. Just because we are outnumbered... There were incidents between Slovenian police and the YU army in Postojna. Slovenian police spread leaflets, Welcome to Slovenia. You're right, fuck the news. Check it out, some fancy booze. What a bottle... American. Want some? It's better than your drugs and shit. Cut the crap. No problem, every dog has its day. You mean every cat has its day. Maybe that's what you say. We say every dog has its day. Whatever. I don't wanna argue. Shit! Tastes like a piss! Throw it out! Hey, you! Truck! What happened? -Man, what a blast! I don't get it. what BONUS? Look how many fish. Wait, I'll pay! Some freak is after us. Oh God, gimme some more dynamite! Dynamite, you deaf fuck! Look! Cool! Rock 'n roll has made it to this shit-hole! It's not a shit-hole, it's Podrinje. Oh, Podrinje, fuck me if you see me again. What was that graffiti? Guns 'n Roses, Rock 'n roll, Appetite for Destruction! Civilisation, you fuck! Guns 'n Roses! My Bosniaaa, beautiful and fair. And my town of Banja Luka, more than I can bear. What a singer! -Of course I sing, I'm in Bosnia. As if it were Hollywood. You bet. Just look at this beauty. When you're colour blind, Bosnia is Disneyland. You'll get to your coast! Latif agaaaa... travelled faaaar... Watch out, it's red! Can't you see the red light! Fucking red. That's why they won't give me the license. Luckily, he didn't slide away. Luckily he's dead. -What's lucky, idiot!? Luckily he was already dead. If he were alive, I wouldn't be burying him. Beat it before I axe you. Oh, Danga, I fixed you real nice. And now you're all fucked up. Hey, he looks like a model! -Don't touch him! Why did you do that? -Kill me if I know. I wouldn't, but you forced me. No, I'd never force you to kill me. Honestly. Liar, you're one of them! Why did you touch him? Hold on, I'm not one of them! I'm not from here. It makes no sense to kill me! Right? Wrong. I can help, take you and Danga wherever you want? We need to take Danga home. He dated one of their girls... and "accidentally" got shot at a party. I need to take him back home. Get it? A lollipop for my boy. Where'd you disappear to? Me?! You kept on babbling with that man. All right, let's go. I got everything. You just pay. What's this? -2200. Give us two sausages and some bread. I'm not eating that shit. -OK. Then this... No, it's your money, you take what you want. Cut the bullshit! -Take that talk to your cowgirls! 2,250. Just for you. Sh-she stole a ch-ch-chocolate banana. What you lookin' at, you idiot! Would anyone explain this to me? This is Danga, this is cousin Butt. What's wrong with him? -Love killed him. The man is drunk. Stop, I want to get out! Danga won't hurt you. I'm holding him. Where do you get off? Top of that hill. Always chased skirt, Danga, even dead you can't resist. His days are over. Now we're all into guns, not dicks. Don't be afraid. Good boy, Danga, good boy! Pull over there. Get him out. Oh, back in Tito's time... You screwed around, no questions asked. Good luck! You'll need it. Oh, Danga, you poor bastard, their young pussy killed you. So what if he was from another village? Forget it... Why are you going to Dubrovnik? To chill out on the coast. Since I'm broke, I'm going to sell some... drawings in Dubrovnik, or sing, or do portraits. You draw? Let me see. -it's dark. Doesn't matter I won't see the colours anyway. You're right. Shit, you're an artist. This is trash, it's copied from postcards. No, still, I like this one the best. If only you'd see colours. -Would you sell it to me? I'll give it to you. When we get there. Bagna di Luca. Banja-Luka-upon-the-sea?! Where's that? In Italy. You draw nice. You also sing nice. You're kind of nice. All of you. What's that? I don't know. Got a cigarette, bro? -Sure, for a fellow driver. Belgrade plates? -Wait, here's a snack. What are you carrying? -Toilets, bathtubs... Furniture from generals' homes. From Slovenia. Evacuation. -No shit? Where to? -Dubrovnik. Forget it! They control the roads. There's no way through Herzegovina. I love pickles! Thanks. Good luck! -You, too. How much left to discharge? -32 days! Then I split. This country won't see me again! Did you do your military service? I flunked the medical. Why? No reason. Good night. Good night. Oh my dreamy meadow is waking... Where are we going? No idea. What do you think? Don't bullshit me. You heard the kid last night? I think he made it all up. To show off in front of you. Not all of it. He sure added a lot. We're talking about the State, the Army, not some truckers joint. I don't believe it. I know discipline, law and order. Slow down, let's check it out. Shit, the kid wasn't lying. -What do we do now? There's a crossroad ahead. I was thinking... about avoiding Herzegovina. If you can go elsewhere to the coast. Up North. it's calmer there. Like Istria, Poreƒç? Poreƒç is good, or Italy. Just think, Italy. Fiat making trucks with Volvo. The highways... it's pedal to the metal. -I don't have a passport. I don't have it either, but I can get it. I got to be in Belgrade in two weeks. But, Poreƒç is cool. There's a summer house there. The owner's not there. A gynaecologist. Put that shit away. -it's just grass. Don't want that shit in my truck! - it's not your truck. What do you think you're doing! You'll fuck it all up! Now we're safe. There's no trouble here. Come on, find the ball, Hunchback pays all. Middle one! -Don't! Move your hands! Fuck! Think you can cheat me, you humped piece of shit! Don't, please, sir! That's my whole week's earnings. Boss, look over there. There! Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. Is it hot? -Only a bit. The air is quivering as if the sky were on fire. A storm is brewing. Cobe sent you? -Maybe. Maybe what? -Maybe he did, maybe he didn't. Everyone's trying to fuck me today. Get out! -No problem. Who do you think you are? You, shut up or we'll fuck you in the ass! Instantly! All four of us! Once again. I said: The air is quivering as if the sky were on fire. And what did you say? -A storm is brewing. So: Cobe sent you. -Yes. See? It wasn't difficult. Cobe sent him. Shoot him. No, he didn't, I have no idea who the guy is! Elvis, search the truck! Just say, Cobe sent me to deliver weapons for the Upper Outcrop! Fuck you bastards! What you talking about? -You knew the password twice. Walter defends Sarajevo? I saw the movie five times. Just one more minute. If you have arms, I'll kill you. If not, I'll do the same. Nothing here, boss. -Nothing? Can we make a deal? -Just shut up! We made a mistake. I apologize, but we still have to kill you. There's no reason to! Don't you have a heart? Who are you with? -Just me and the girl. The question was: are you one us or one of them?! Us. -And who is us? We're all the same to me: A man is a man: a dick is a dick. Well, we're all the same, except for our dicks. Drop your pants! No fucking way! What is it, panic? When you see the python, you'll be fucked up. I'm quitting grass for sure! I want it as a souvenir. You should be ashamed. For all of us, this man is: Tito. Mister, whoever you are, welcome to Koka's territory! Sorry, I'm Koka. And, my respects! Let's go! -Have a nice day! What? Running away, you chicken shit?! I'm gonna call my dad... He'll send the Air Force, to break your balls! Oh, my.. Elvis, go slash the tyre. I'm sorry. In general, we're nice people. It's just this situation. If you ever come to Lower Outcrop, I have a restaurant, "Monaco". We have kebab, this big! For you, they'll be for free. Good luck! And please don't take it personally! You're not mad at me? -What do you think? Fuck, you know what you've been carrying? We're lucky they didn't find it. What's that? -What? Some kind of a forest gnome! -I don't take hitch-hikers. It's a hunchback. -No way? Hunchback, you son of a bitch! I don't believe it! They let you out already? Same old you, just the backpack is growing. Who beat you up?-Don't ask. Can you give me a ride? Of course. -Who's the pussy there? Better behave yourself! -No problem. You know me. I do, that's why. Sorry, did I squeeze you? -Your squeezing is no problem. I wouldn't mind being squeezed by tits. As if they were some tits. -Tits are tits. I didn't know I was a con artist type. You're anyone's type, but my friend Ratko here. He only gets turned on by trucks. Hunchback, where do you get off? You better get outta here. Both of you. We're not together. -Doesn't matter. You might wake up with a bulletin your head. Want some seeds? -No, thanks. Everybody's giving gold for a rifle now. Really? -Yeah. Anyone of ours do guns? -Kraut does. He's the one. Smuggles guns, people. Has a merry-go-round. In Drekavica. Why? Just asking. If I weren't a hunchback, I'd ask you to marry me. So what if you have a hump? You're charming, cute... You mean good for... Hunchback, what the fuck you think you're doing? It's a joke. What got into you? -What got into me?! A fisherman fished... And caught a goldfish... It said: I'll fulfil you a wish. You'll live your life... ...like no one of your kin, in true happiness and joy. Thanks for the ride. Take good care of this kid! This Hunchback guy is a genius. Idiot. -What about you? Then why didn't you stay with him? He's funny, cracks jokes, he's not a bore like you. This isn't Belgrade, you can't fool around like that. Who are you to tell me how to behave?! You think you can run my life, moron?! I'm not your fucking truck! -Leave my truck alone. Why didn't you stay with him? If he is a genius. I'm not with you, I'm just riding with you. Clear?! I didn't ask you to ride with me. I've had enough of your shit. I'm going back to Belgrade! Pull over there! -You want me to pull over? Yes! You should go and see a doctor! You're jealous of a midget! You're totally mad! Junky! Oh, lord, won't you to buy me a Mercedes Benz... Fucking seeds... She's over here! Don't be afraid, sweetie-pie! -May we help you, in any way? I'll call the police! -Police, no shit?! My father is an officer. He'll kill you! Lovers always fight! I'm gonna scream! -Go ahead! I love screamers. What are you waiting for?! An invitation? Get in! BONUS! Give them a "bonus"! I'm afraid. -Of what? Of everything. There's no reason. it's my fault. Look what you look like! What do I look like? Like shit. I'm sorry. Stop apologizing, you moron. I am not a nurse. I can't stand blood and that shit. Don't get my hair sticky with your mess. Let's go to the lake to wash up. Thank God you got rid of that tacky shirt. It's a nice shirt, nothing wrong with it. What is this, a Peace sign? It's not a Peace, it's a Mercedes sign. Are you crazy, want to get an infection? What colour is my belly button? Wait here. Put it on. I don't want that shit. No way! Try it, maybe you'll see colours. What do you mean? -Try it. You've got a chance. You'll be fine, it's only grass. I won't become a junkie? -You won't. On the contrary... if you don't smoke grass, you'll become a junkie. I don't get it. Marijuana and alcohol are light drugs. Everything else is hard drugs. Politics, news, war-warmongering, cocaine, heroin, turbo-folk, democracy, communism... All that shit is hard drugs. Compared to that, this is a child's play. A way to stay normal. Get it? You're such a scholar! Wait! Is this it?! Colours? Look at that! Man, an old hit from your parts! Come here. Who, me? -You. I see glitters. Like stars. I see large fires... Like haystacks on fire. It's growing. I can hear fireworks. What are you doing? Drawing your tattoo, dragon or whatever. A python. But I'm not like that. First truck I drove, a Volvo, had a python on the hood. I wanted to show off I could take the pain. It's silly. -Why silly? it's cool. That's why I never wanted to do it with a girl, until now. You are definitely the weirdest guy. Will you marry me? You're not weird, you're nuts. Don't be cruel to the man who loves you. I am sick again. I've got an idea! It's OK. Have some ink? I've got India ink. -Great. Give it to me. Why do you need it? For a tattoo machine! -Tattoo? You said it was cool. It doesn't hurt. Just stings a little. Fuck you! I'll do mine first, you'll see it's nothing. What's that? -A tear, the symbol of your name. On your shoulder? -No, please! Don't... I can't stand pain. Please, don't... I want to go home. -Forget about it. Let's go straight to Italy. Fuck Poreƒç. I don't have a passport, and I don't have money. We've got those guns, we'll find Kraut. Don't worry, Ratko will take care of everything. Wait, somebody's coming! Hide your arms! What's the matter? -Move over! You should feel good with me. I'll let you try. I wouldn't do it for nobody else. Try what? You got some stuff? I'm gonna teach you to drive a truck. - A truck? Mercedes Benz. Get behind the wheel. It'll change everything. You'll feel great. Now, slowly, release it... Way to go! Look ahead! You're driving! -Oh, man... That's my song! The clutch, third gear! There you go! Look out! Not into the field! Watch the peasants! Good. We're back on the road. Just go straight. I've had enough. -We've only started. Way to go! Look out! Brake! Fuck, I killed a priest. -Why don't you watch out! Were you baptised? -it's your fault! If you weren't, it doesn't matter he was a priest. It's like killing anyone. If I killed him I'll be screwed. Because I believe in God. Shut up, it's your fault! You blind fuck! Bastard! Maybe you didn't kill him. -No way. He was old. At least he didn't die young. Maybe he's not dead. Go check it out. Me? What if he isn't dead? -What do you mean? I'm embarrassed. -You're a sissy, like all men! A python's no use, you don't have the balls! I've been driving for years, and never killed anyone! But you screw up everything! That's all you ever do! Let go of me! You fucking dork! Children! -Father, fuck, you're alive! Children, what are you doing? You should not fight. He who loves shall be saved. -And those who have dough. My godless child, the beauty of the world here, and yet... Misfortune is still to come. The question is... If we'll make it: you - to run away, me - to prevent misfortune. You know why? -Even God kissed this place good-bye. Something like that. But, why? -How should I know? God cannot hear us because of our Julian calendar. We and the Russians observe our calendar, and look at us. Greeks, also Orthodox, observe the new calendar. God hears them. They are doing fine. When I pray to St. Elijah on his day... he is not there. He was there two weeks ago. Like a bad connection. Aren't we right? With our old calendar? Dumbo. Like an old phone book. You dial wrong numbers. I told you. Our prayers don't reach up there. Go away to where God can hear you! This is it. The oak tree with the inscription is there. It's a curse to cut it. I have to stop them. How will you do that? -By God's word. Sorry to have hit you. -it is nothing. Here you are. To be heard better. It is not German? -No, it's Russian. OK then. Run away, children! God, understand if you can... And if you are there. The tree is on our land! The border's here! No, the tree is the border! If we can't have it, we'll cut it! People, listen to me! This is nothing, compared to what might happen. Do not tempt the devil! For if you do, he will screw all of us! You get it, Anti-Christs? What's this, another Peace sign? This is my father. Slavoljub. Dad, this is Suzanna, she'll be my wife. See what the scum have done. That's my Slavoljub, always on the move. I have to tell you something. I don't remember him. He was killed when I was a kid. Later, my mother left with another man. He loved her very much. And strangled her. - Fuck! That happens a lot here. People are passionate. Ratko, listen.. I feel bad to leave him here where they desecrate his grave. Dad, we're off to Italy. -That's not his grave? Who would know that? He was driving a gas tanker. A school bus came round the bend, crossed over to his side. To avoid the bus, Slavoljub turned this way and boom! Nothing left to bury. Firm offered to bury an empty coffin...Ma just took the money. The steering wheel was the only thing left. So in a way... this is his grave. Local people say that at night... When someone's in trouble Slavoljub appears in his tanker to help. Listen to me now! I'm not gonna be your wife, I'm not going to Italy with you! I'm pregnant, I need to be back in Belgrade... in two weeks to have an abortion. We're going to have a baby? Already? No!! -That's great! -I want to go home! Italy, palm trees, a beach, just like in your picture. And us, with a baby... We'll never come back here! OK, OK, we're leaving... I don't want to leave my Dad here. Boss! Hi, Kraut! -Hi, Ratko, old man! Great... We're gonna wipe each other out. The chick is a candy. And you're smart to leave. It's too tense here. It can blow up any minute. And those abroad only make things worse. A payback for screwing their bitches. Cheers. Luckily they didn't dress you in uniform. I can't tell colours apart. Doesn't matter. Civil war has no colours. That's the beauty of it - not knowing who's who! Good? -You bet it is. Whatever people need to be happy, I provide. Merry-go-rounds, lollipops or machine guns. I like to see happy faces. it's the way I am. -You are. I better push off. -Wait! How will you get to the border? Give me that map. Roadblocks are everywhere. You pay your way with arms. Here, at Bear's Claw, you tell them: Simo sent you, and give them 100 eggs, 5,6 chickens ...10 hens. -What are you talking about? What eggs? Eggs are bullets, chicks are pistols, hens are rifles. Where is it? -Here. -No, you lose again. Here you say, Hasan sent you, Give them 100 - 5 - 10. And here you say Stipe, and give them a 100 - 20 - 20. Take care, there are two Kraut mercenaries. Dangerous guys. Keep the explosive for the end, for the Italian border. You're cheating! Run man, shit has started! I don't like the face of this guy. Let's kill him. But look at the truck, Mercedes Benz, 1213. My brother and I drove a red one like that. I can't kill him. Hans, what's the matter with you? I can't kill a man who drives a red Mercedes truck. OK, I'll do it. If you kill him, I'll kill you. Want some water? Want to wash up? You feel sick? -Yes, I feel sick. I'm sick of everything, I just want out of this. We'll be at the border in two hours. I want to go back home. I'm scared and I'm cold. There's no way back now. We made a deal, no way back now. I'll run off on you. -Not a chance. I'll kidnap you, take you by force. Suzanna!... Suzanna! Out of the way, moron! Fine, if you want it. Where's the other one? What's this? -Love, honey... love. But what's that rumble? Fuck! War! Let's get out of here! The second gear! The third one! That's my girl! I'm sorry I ran you over. -Forget it, we say: If they don't kill each other, it's not true love. Ratko? -Huh? -I need to pee. Can't you wait until Italy? We're close. What an ass! -it is. Look at him. Redneck! Fuck! Move! The army's attacking! The train from Vienna, via Trieste, to Ljubljana... Zagreb and Belgrade, is departing immediately. How is this possible? Because this is love. Don't ask. I have to tell you something. Ratko Junior is black. It's all the same to me. Colours mean nothing to me. This film is dedicated to all those who see things in a different way.
