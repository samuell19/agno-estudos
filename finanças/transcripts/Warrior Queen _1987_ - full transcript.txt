Do I hear 100? 100. 150. 175. 175, 175. 200. Now for this luscious young man of the lot. 300 for the boy. 300. - Four. - 400. Greetings, fair Berenice. The citizens of Pompeii extend our warmest welcome. I'm the mayor of the city of Pompeii. I'm delegated to escort you to the villa of our distinguished consul A. Clodius, veteran of the Germanic rebellion, three times Roman quaestor and member of the-- We can do better than that. But, Your Highness, let me accompany you to Clodius' villa. He's waiting, Your Highness. Your Highness, wait, you can't go in there. I have the great, great pleasure to announce that we have an imperial visitor. The most esteemed companion to our-- From what I hear of Berenice, she's come to the right place here. Why should her tastes be any different than ours? Why indeed. And the leading citizen of the Roman province of Judea... Berenice. ( cheers and applause ) Shall we resume, Your Highness? Shall we resume, Your Highness? Go ahead. I have 200 for this lovely Grecian girl. Do I hear 250? 250. Sold for 250 sesterces to Anthony. Next. We have another luscious male morsel. What am I bid, gentlemen? What am I bid?

Sold for 1,000 sesterces to Victo of the House of Venus. Your Highness. Wait, Your Highness. Please. The consul is waiting. Let me accompany you to the villa. Your Highness. Come on, keep them moving. Get them cleaned up for their debut tonight. All right, come along. Quickly. ( indistinct chatter ) Marcus, Marcus. That's Marcus, the famous charioteer. Perhaps you would like to accompany Her Highness to the villa? Perhaps. Yah! Welcome. Welcome! Welcome! Welcome. City of Pompeii greets you. There is most graceful hospitality. Every facility at my command is yours, and at the service of Imperial Rome. Ah, I see you come with a companion. Welcome, Marcus, and the greatest of good fortune on your games. I myself have placed my money on your distinguished competitor Goliath. Nevertheless, do not fear. We shall not poison your wine. Accept apologies for my miserable wife Philomena. Wine... from my own vineyard. The very finest vintage. Your Highness. Give him the cheap stuff. Go on. Don't be afraid. Come on. My lovely highness. I know we cannot hope to compare with the marvels of Rome. With very little to offer here except the little-- perhaps an occasional diversion. And to that end, my lovely Highness, my beautiful Highness, mistress to the esteemed Titus, the greatest Caesar Rome has ever known... we have spared no prospects. We have prepared a very special little contest, Your lovely Highness, for your viewing pleasure. The fighter who falters shall find himself doubly doomed. A spike shall enter his hand... and the poison shall enter his bloodstreams. ( trumpet blowing fanfare ) Begin! You loved me once. I'd loved many women once. Come with me. Catch a dove, Your Highness. Your Highness. Surely, lovely Highness-- My lovely Highness. My lovely-- Silence! I want some silence! Silence! Easy. Easy. Don't be scared. I'm not gonna hurt you. Go ahead and cry. Yah! Yah! ( screaming ) Welcome, Goliath. We have some novelties this evening I think will amuse you. No. No! No! No, please. No! No! I, I, no, help. Please! Please! Goliath, I hate him. He's a fighter, a dirty fighter. He is the one who will battle Marcus in the games tomorrow. So you know of Marcus? So does everyone. He is the dream of every woman, but eludes all. His affairs are quick and fleeting. You should know, eh, Veneria? This is Augusta, named after the empress. She carries herself like a slut and never gives her name. Unlike us, she is not a prisoner here. Then why does she stay? Because I like it. You know, little girl, pleasure is a far greater prod than dignity. You'll soon find someone to fill your every need. Augusta. Amongst your other activities, the House of Venus offers you one of its famed specialty numbers. I recommend that you gather around. It's an act to be seen from close up. Gentlemen, present Augusta. And her amazing prehensile partner. Gentlemen, tonight, along with the beautiful women and lust-loving boys that you have come to expect from the House of Venus, we offer a unique cavorting. Today as you know, have been brought to Pompeii some of the rarest, most appetizing samples of human flesh to be found anywhere in the empire. Gentlemen, tonight, we have an exquisite young boy from the wilds of the north... and from the distant province of Palestine, a genuine virgin. Never touched by manly hand. ( cheers and applause ) Delectable, yeah? This is the woman I choose for tonight. I'll have the virgin for this evening. I want her. I'll match Goliath's offer and add to it 100 sesterces. ( screaming ) Your Imperial Highness. She's mine. Don't be scared. Trust me. This is from your tribe of Palestine. You're not alone. But... Sometimes it's better to fight from the inside. Save this until later when it will mean your freedom and not slavery. Have faith. Take me away from here. Yes, yes, my lovely, lovely Highness. I'm sure few cities rival Pompeii for the magnitude and grandeur of its next spectacle that I'll leave you to find out for yourself. Such a tragedy that the emperor could not be here himself, tear himself away from fairest Rome to be with us on this day, but then I'm sure you will relay a report and tell him of the magnificence of these games, and of the man responsible for that. Who's that? ( cheering and applause ) - Marcus. - Marcus. Marcus. Marcus. Marcus. Are they ready? Are they looking their best? We know how lucrative these little outings to the games can be. All right, they will do. Okay, bring them along, and you, pretty boy, behave yourself today. Come on. Come along. You can close up, all right? ( cheers and applause ) You see those stables? That's where the men prepare for the games. Your Marcus is there now. If he wins today, and the chariot race tomorrow as well, he will be champion of the empire. Almighty gods, bless this occasion. Bless the city of Pompeii, and all its citizens for thousands of years. Bring prosperity and well-being to all. Bless the Emperor Titus and the Roman Empire. ( cheers and applause ) Let the games begin! ( roaring ) ( applause ) Yes! Bravo! ( cheers and applause ) Marcus wants to purchase you for an outing by the Herculaneum woods near the Nucerian Gate. You will be returned by nightfall. Can I bring my friend? Why not? With the money that he's paid. Come on. And I've got something special lined up for you later. Marcus, how could you? Come with me. Marcus. Vespa. ( horse neighing ) Come on. Come on, pretty boy. Listen, I want you to treat our friend very well, understand? Never. Wouldn't like me to sell off Veneria, would you, would you? Right. He will be a good boy. Come on, pretty boy. Come on, come. My wife finds my habits immoral and disgusting. That's only because I give to these two what she longs for herself. You haven't provided me with that in years, or any woman. Come on. Come on, pretty. Stop him, stop him, I paid for him. Get him, get him. Don't you want some, Your Highness? Well, if you've got no appetite for food, perhaps we could find you a little stable boy to give you some amusement. Or a serving wench. The kitchen staff has all been carefully selected. My lovely Highness. Have some pig, pig. ( screaming ) Stay here. ( screaming ) Are you okay? I will have you. You will take me now. Yes, Marcus, I've craved you. Your touch, your body pressed against mine. Ever since-- it was so long ago. And I vowed I would have you. I vowed you would take me again. Now I have humiliated myself before you, and you will take me. You make me feel so... You don't know what it's like being married to Clodius. His sickness, his filthy touch, not even a man's. Marcus, I need you. Veneria, you've become a pathetic old whore. And that bitch you sleep with is any better? Go back to your Clodius. You deserve each other. In fact, he may treat you much better when he learns of the truth. You would not tell him. The mountain, Your Highness, is like a royal trumpet greeting the championship day. What about-- Vesuvius. Volcanoes are not like men, who shoot and then replenish themselves. My lovely Highness, when volcanoes are dead, they stay dead. Clodius, begging your pardon, but there's been some fear expressed. - Fear for the games. - Fear? I contest fear. It's an emotion for the weak and feeble. But the eruptions grow stronger. The outskirts are already ablaze. We're not in the outskirts. We're in the very center of Pompeii. It is said in the temple of Jupiter, a statue cried tears of salt, a cow gave birth to a calf with a human head. I should like to see this cow. Does it also give mother's milk? Listen to him. You, too, my lovely Highness? There's my disgusting wife. Did you give your charioteer the satisfaction he needed? ( trumpets blowing fanfare ) ( applause ) Oh! ( screaming ) Get back, get back to the arena. Anybody fleeing from the city of Pompeii will be imprisoned, get back. Get back. All of you, get back, get back, get back, get back. Roberto! Veneria! Come on, let's go. ( screaming ) Philomena. Philomena, stop. Stop the mountain, make it stop. No! Philomena, don't leave. ( screaming ) I must. I must save. Save what? ( horse neighing ) Uh! Veneria! Veneria! Roberto! So you thought you'd get away? No! No, no, no. No, no, Roberto! Roberto, no. No, please. No. No! Roberto! ( screaming ) Berenice.
