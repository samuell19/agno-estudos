[music playing] Another taste of the cat scratch will get your heathen back into the task. [crack] Ah! [crack] Ah! [laughing] [crack] Dig, you galley scum. Leave him. Keep digging. Back to your digging. My Hey, One Eye. You'll be digging up a king's ransom with your own hands if you keep dashing the help. I believe there is no treasure here, just like there was no treasure in the Tortugas or Cayman Brac or anywhere else that you selled us. Now, have you ever known a falsehood to leave the lips of Jezebel Jack? We must be reading the map wrong, would you say? You shall deceive us more, Jezebel Jack. Oh, it takes a brave man to utter words of mutiny. [gunshot] Shoot, you cowardly dogs, shoot! [men yelling] [gunshots] To your right, man, to your right. Stand and be delivered to the author of your creation. Jack. Help. Help, Captain. Help, Captain. You shall be a fine feast for the scorpions. Fair sailing. Ah! Burn by Beelzebub's hand forever, Jezebel Jack. [country music playing] Boom, boom, boom. Boom, boom. Oh, hi, Mrs. Gateland. Slow down, young man. You nearly caused me to have my spasms. Oh, did you see that, Mr. Gray? He's a menace, always hooting around, scaring the devil out of everybody. That boy needs to be on a leash, a pole in the yard, tied up where he can't hurt anybody. Isn't that right, Cecil, baby? Please calm down, Mrs. Gateland. I'll take care of Bobby. Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! You've really upset Mrs. Gateland. Upset? He nearly killed me. Boom, boom, boom, boom. Bobby! He's an obstinate boy. Hi, Mr. Gray, the Plantarians will stop at nothing to take me to the ship. Boy's just pretending. [laughs] Well, what he needs is some discipline. Boom, boom, boom, boom. Boom, boom, boom, boom. Phone's out of order, Mrs. Gateland. Oh, well, come on, Cecil, let's go call his mother. Boom, boom, boom, boom. Boom, boom, boom., Bobby. Bobby, snap out of it. Oh, uh, hi, Mr. Gray. Got any tomato paste? Oh. Mr. Skinner. Ah, Ms. Jennings. Good morning. I made some iced tea. Would you like some? Yes, please. Oh, what a lovely home. It's so rural. Boom, boom. That was boom, boom, boom, boom. Oh, no. Out of ammo. Bobby, I'm sorry, honey. You can't play in here right now. But, Mom, Brent James and the Younger gang were about to-- I don't want to hear any more about the James gang. No go on out to the shed and help Grandpa. But, Mom. Go on. Sorry, Mr. Skinner. I'm fine, thanks. He's got a big imagination. No need to apologize, Ms. Jennings. Boys can dream up almost anything. You were saying. Yes. If your bank can just wait till I bring this harvest in, I'm sure I can make up the back payments. If this was to me, Ms. Jennings, there wouldn't be a problem. But my hands are tied. Frankly, the loan committee is nervous since your husband left. There is nothing I can do. My husband left two years ago, Mr. Skinner, and I've made some payments. En garde, Sir Skinner. [inaudible], sir. [inaudible] your ugly looks. Take this, Mr. Skinner. Hey, Grandpa. Yeah. Mom said you needed some help. GRANDPA: Oh, she did, huh? OK. Let's see here. Why don't you hand me that wrench over there, Bobby. What's wrong, son? Mom's always yelling at me, any time I try to play anything. Well, you can have to understand that your mom's been under an awful lot of pressure lately. She says to quit making stuff up, but you tell me Jesse James and the Younger gang were real. Well, they were real. Legend says they came right through here. They did? You never told me that. Did they shoot any bankers? After they robbed the Glendale train, they rode straight through Nebraska. And they had a US Marshal right on their tail. Now, as the story goes, the strongbox with the silver bars was so heavy that it was slowing Jess and the gang down. So they had to do something about that. So, they get rid it. They hit it right here in the Benson County area. Really? Yeah, I want to show you something. Hold on. Here it is. It's a secret. Don't tell anybody. Right here. Now this is a copy from a newspaper article from 1876. Now they published a picture of the maps that Alan Pinkerton took from one of the Younger gang. Let me show you something. Look here. There's Lincoln, and there's the old Pennsylvania tracks. What are all these things? Well, I guess that's some sort of a code that Jesse made up. Fact is, nobody ever figured it out. And that old Crenshaw Lake strongbox is still waiting to be found. You mean it's around here somewhere? Right here in Lincoln, so they say. Let's go hunt for it, Grandpa. GLENNA: No, you're not going to hunt for anything, young man, until you get some chores done around here. Now, you go wrap up that scrap bailing wire you were supposed to do yesterday. But Mom, if we could find the silver-- Bobby, the wire. OK, Mom. You know, it doesn't help, you filling his head with all these tall tales. Glenna, it's just a story. It's a part of history. I'm worried about him, Dad. You know, these characters, they-- they become so real to him. It's spooky. Look, the boy doesn't have anybody to play with, and it's been really rough on him since John's been gone. Yeah, well, it's been really rough on all of us. [screaming] Hey! Take care, man. They were thick with savages, human carrion, if truth be told. I laid bare my cutlass before don't them. Ah! Take it easy, mate. You wouldn't want your old captain to pass on to his certain glory now would you? Oh, you're a brave one, Captain. Those savages eat the flesh of sailing men. I tried to save the lads. But there were herds of the cursed devils. By the fate of the author of all that's good, I saw this one in me leg. And the heathen ran big beak through with a jagged spear, made by the devil himself. Grieve not now, my captain. I do my best, but this is going to hurt. Nothing like the pain in my heart when I realized that I could not get that treasure up for you boys. Ah! Rejoice, Alli, it is out! Ah! Sorry, Captain, might I bear the pain myself. Now you get some rest. Out. Yes, Captain, take it easy. You'll be at the helm soon, Captain. Come on, Reg. He needs his rest. Don't she look pretty, right there. [laughing] Well go on. Didn't you hear the ship's medic? Leave this old hulk to rest on a leisure. My blood must calm after fighting off a nation of savages. A nation of savages, was it? Oh, a thousand of the bloody things, whooping their bloody war cry. It was enough to shiver the bones of even the bravest soldier. This, real map, was revealed to me hidden in the log book. Planning to split up the treasure was never your course. Sailing back to Kingston was your sure plan to rid us all and use the real map for your own. Well I haven't had that much schooling, but I reckon that half an equal share, be a smart better than a tenth, hey? Mate. Mate it it hey? Well, I know the map and I have no need for a mate. That map is coded in the language of an adventurer. Demon starts in your fool head. You mutinous dog. Time's come for Jezebel Jack to meet his creator. Hah! [gunshot] The creator is not yet ready for a rogue such as I. What's going on? What's happened here? Captain? And then Mr. Skinner says we haven't paid the night for three months. Three months. Bet the Carson's haven't paid theirs for six months. Pass the potatoes please. I know it's been three months, but it's not like he doesn't understand the farming business. He knows we can't even harvest for another month. [gunshots] And he knows with John gone, the work's harder, and it's already been a problem. If he's going to take this farm away from me, he's got another thing coming. I have worked way too hard to be intimidated by someone like Mr. Skinner. I'm right on the edge here, do you understand? Got to do something. I mean, we can't afford to take any chances. We're not going to be able to make ends meet. Oh, I know. I know. Well, it upsets me, you know? What does he expect me to do? What am I gonna do? I mean, I'm right on the edge here, Dad. Cover us. Jesse, it's over. OK, Jesse, run for it. Bobby! What's gotten into you? Did I get him? You get over there and clean up that mess right now. I'm sorry. I thought I-- Oh never mind. Go on, go to your room. Hurry up. What has gotten into this child? Now, Glenna, calm down. Ah! Look at this. [crying] Looks like a big one coming. We'd better lock it down. OK. Get Bobby to help you. I'll get the tool shed. Come on, Bobby, let's go. Hurry, it's muscling up outside. Coming, Grandpa. Bobby, bring the laundry in the house. Oh! Grandpa! What happened? Are you OK? Bobby, Bobby, I'm hurt real bad. Let me help you up. No, no, no. Go get your mother. Now hurry. Mom! Bobby, you cover the tractor and then you stay inside. Come here. I want to say I'm sorry about how angry I was last night. That's OK, Mom. When I get Grandpa to the hospital, I'll call, OK? Don't worry, Mom, I can take care of the house. You're going to be OK, ain't you, Grandpa? I'm going to be fine, son. I'll just be out of action for a little while. Just hold the fort, soldier. That a boy. Let's go If my lungs filled with the salty sea, my blood will be on your hands, and ye confounded dogs will never find the treasure that you labored so hard to acquire. Fergus found out about your phony map, Jackie boy, and you murdered the poor bugger for it. It was self-defense. [laughing] He's a lying flacker. Yeah, throw him over. We've been sailing the seven seas like fools following your tall tales. Now we got the real map, thanks to Fergus, god rest his soul. Not too hasty, lads. If ye desire to become rich gentlemen of means, that map is coded in the language of an adventurer. We've had enough. Tell your lies to the squids. Yeah! [non-english speech] To drown a chief is to be cursed. Listen, you swabs, the witch speaks of things that are beyond ye. A captain and a chief be the same in the eyes of the spirits. And the Author of all that is good will cast down fates upon ye that ye cannot bear. You're doomed by your own hand if ye shove that sticker [inaudible]. The spirits are angry, even now. Thou has been warned by the mouth of the witch. Ah! You're a lying, thieving, murdering, double-crosser, Jezebel Jack. We'll not be betrayed by a wicked such as you again. Mr. Murzol, loose him nigh. The curses of Sulsatan be on your skull. Can you see him? Did he go down? What's that? Well the grass certainly grows well in hell. PA SYSTEM: Dr. Martin, please report to surgery, Dr. Martin, please report to surgery. [phone ringing] What governor resides on an island in the Sea of Sargasos? [phone ringing] Bobby, pick up the phone. Ma'am, you can see your father now before we take him to x-ray. Great. Thanks. I'll be right there. Hello? Hello? Hello? Right, 'tis but a lad. Lord? Be I in heaven or hell? Answer me, Lord. I've not lived a God fearing life. Whatever your judgment, that Spanish wench deserved it. You're awake. An angel. I've been saved, Lord. You've had mercy on my black soul. Hallelujah! I'm in heaven. No, you're not. You're in Nebraska. Nebraska? Is that near Jamaica. No, it's near Kansas. Oh, well, why didn't you say so? Kansas, is it? Kansas? Would that be at the bottom of the sea? I must arise. Arise. The ship is capsizing. Abandon ship! Abandon ship! Every man for himself. Hold on, hold on. It's just a chair. To the Lifeboats Hold on, hold on. Wait just a moment. What? You got a boo-boo. A boo-boo? Let me fix that. It'll get infected. Wait there. Doomed to a Dutchman's hell. I'm going to spray some disinfectant on it. Now hold still. This may sting a little. Ah! Ah! You are the devil! You stuck me with an invisible knife. What demon possesses you, boy? It's just to keep the infection down. It'll go away. Please, please calm down. [growling] Hey, really, it's OK. Now does it feel better. What kind of black magic is this? Ah! [giggles] It's not funny. It's not funny at all. He never came up, ne'er even once. The sharks took him speedily. There's no blood in the water. He's dead. Devils don't die. They just evolve. You're daft. The man's dead. No, no, no, no, no! He lives as sure as the wind. A what? A Band-Aid? Another form of human torture. That looks pretty good. Are you hungry? You look starved. The fire at your fingertips. This ain't heaven. I got some really neat stuff. My name's Bobby. What's yours? Hey, Jim, you're a very young lad to be left all alone in a gentleman's country house. It's not Jim. It's Bobby. Aye, Jim, tell me again, where we be. We be? Aye. Where be we? We be in Nebraska. They call you-- Jack. Captain Jezebel Jack. - Here. Pour milk on them like this, Captain. Aye, Jim, captain of the Delilah, the most feared lady of the Caribbean. Since 1713, she has carried off more treasure from the Dutch, from those confounded hounds, the Spaniards, and even good King George of reputation. You're a pirate? No. Pirates are thieves and killers. I am an adventurer of independent means. How did you get here? The fingers of The Dark One through me through the sky. Gummy bears? Oh, aye. gummy bears. You really think you're a real pirate? Adventurer. Oh, yeah, an adventurer. Jim, when will these jellyfish let go of my teeth. Dad? Hi, honey. Hi. How's the shoulder? Oh, it'll be OK. Well, they're supposed to take you to x-ray in a couple minutes. Has anybody been in here to check on you? Will you stop making such a fuss? I'm not making a fuss. I think I'm going to go try and call Bobby again. Calm down, Glenna. Bobby is used to spending time with himself. So Might you know the whereabouts of a nice noggin of rum, brandy, spirits of that ilk. The timbers that hold this old ship together rest assuredly on its consumption. Mom says drinking ain't good for you and it's a sin. Oh, it's a sin, is it? Your mother doesn't know what wicked is. Wicked flops in the foam aboard the Delilah. OK, anything you say. Arg! Pull down the shutters, Jim. There are them that have no need of eying us. OK, I'll shut the drapes. You never know who might shiver you in the back. [monkey starts singing] I think you better go now. Say what? I think you better go now. My dad will be home soon. Oh, aye. Maybe so. A gracious deed you did, Jim, taking in an old barnacled hull such as I, cleaning me wounds and tending to me nourishment. A kind sort such as you deserves the greatest of all gifts. But I have only a small trinket to give you for your kindness. What is it? A life saver, just for you, my boy. Wow! A derringer, wow! I can't believe it. Is it real? It's authenticity can be testified to by a gentleman name of Fergus. This is so cool. Well, I must be shoving off now. Hey, Captain. Aye? Want to watch some TV together? TV? Aye. TV. - Mr. Thurston will see you now. - Thank you. I'll be right back. Mr. Skinner, good to see you. Good to see you too, sir. Have you been working hard at your craft these days? Yes, sir. A few obstacles here and there, but nothing I can't handle. Soon as we foreclose we'll be able to turn that red section right there into blue. Yeah, Mr. Skinner, and your bank account will be a lot greener. The auction price would be very favorable to the project, sir. Yeah, yeah. We should have been pushing dirt by now, I know, I know. Just one more step. All I have to do is convinced the credit manager that the Jennings family can't pay their debt. The bank is reluctant to throw families off their farms. Are you telling me there's a chance this property won't be auctioned? - Oh, no, sir. That is not what I'm telling you. As a matter of fact, that piece of property is as good as gone. You know, Jim, I've heard tales of the little people from rum drunkards at the Brac, but it never come to my mind that they would be in a box. You've never seen TV before? What's this here? Jewels that would ransom a queen from the unchurched. That's the Home Shopping Network. That's where you can buy anything. How do you get into this treasure chest, Jim? Captain, Captain, it's not a treasure chest. Put it down! It's a TV set. It's got no lock, no lid. What kind of treachery is this? Stand and deliver. Captain, no! [gunshot, sizzling] [phone rings] Wait, wait a minute. Just stay cool, Captain. Hello? Bobby. Hi, honey. Are you OK? Oh yeah, sure, Mom. How's Grandpa? Oh well, we're waiting for the x-rays right now. Was there any damage to the house? Nope, no damage. That's good. You're sure you're OK there by yourself? Oh, I'm not by myself. I have a new friend. He's a pirate. Well, that's good, honey. Just don't tear up anything sword fighting. Oh, we're not sword fighting. We're just watching TV. Oh, good. OK, well, I'll be home in a little while. OK. Bye, gotta go now. Hey, Bobby. I love you. Don't worry about us. Bye. Captain, wait, wait. Maybe he'll grow out of it. I bought that shirt for my Dad at the State Fair. But he never wore it. This was your father's shirt? Where is he? He left a long time ago. Oh. Went to sea, did he, Jim? Not exactly. He went to Milwaukee. Oh, captured by the Milwaukee? Those African tribes are vicious, they are. No, he went to Milwaukee. Because, well, he didn't want to live with me and Mom. He said he'd never leave, but he did. Now, Jim, don't you fret none. I myself have suffered a great loss. Did your dad leave you too? Jim, you must be on your guard, because when a man leaves his own blood kin, those that are left behind are apt to take up ways that-- that they will certainly regret. Now, let's be about our business. Yeah, business. What business is that? Don't ask questions of your captain. Just say aye, aye, sir. Say it. Aye, aye, sir. Good Lord. This be the biggest silver nugget I've ever seen. That would be for sure, Jim. What? Oh that's tin foil. See, it's used to cover up stuff. Tin foil, is it? A fool's deception. See it comes right of the roll. Now, you pounded this silver thin as parchment, did you, Jim? No, it just comes like that. See? This isn't silver either. It's chrome. And where can we get more of these chrome canisters? At the store, I guess, along with ice cream sandwiches. You want an ice cream sandwich? Aye, lad. We'll board the Earl of Sandwich's ship straight away. Aye, aye, Captain, to the Earl of Sandwich. That coveted prize doesn't stay at anchor forever. Yeah! Jim, lad, you bring brightness into a dark heart. That you do. Hold on, Captain. Yee-haw! [giggling] Yee-haw! On, James, on! This is it. I'll get us the ice cream sandwiches. Stay here, Captain. A Dutch East Indies four master would not carry such a prize. Mr. Gray, me and my friend want to buy an ice cream sandwich. Sure, Bobby, you know where the freezer is. Go on back. Oh, yes. [whistling] Hey, Captain, you want a Popsicle or an Eskimo pie? Yes, sir, can I-- Stand and deliver. Stand and deliver, I say. Deliver? Deliver what? Oh, we can make deliveries, no problem. Captain, don't do this. The silver, you land livered scum. Late it nye in the tilt. Sir, we don't have silver. Captain, you're going to get us in trouble. You want these? Well, yes, are you deaf? And the jewels. I'll take the gold coins. Captain, don't. Jim, this one is simple. They don't even carry a cutlass. Mr. Gray, I noticed that delinquent Jennings child's motorcycle outside. Stand and deliver! What? Oh! Oh! Stand and deliver, madam. Stand? Why, I beg your pardon. I am a lady. No, madam. It's OK, Ms. Gateland, he's just an adventurer. The earrings. Oh, dear. Another time, wench, you and I shall split a flask of rum. Oh, my. - Come on, Jim. Grab the dog. We'll eat it later. Just hold on, Mr. Gray. I'll bring that stuff right back. Now, Captain, I'm going to have to bring the stuff back to Mr. Gray. What? We captured it fair and square. Mr. Gray is a friend of mine. Oh, a friend is he? A mate. Come on, let me have it. Me thinks you'd be making a great mistake. This was easy booty. Captain, you don't want to regret this later, do you? Give it to me. Captain, give it to me. Thanks, Captain. Pirates, you can't take them anywhere. Make him comfortable. I'll be back to see him later. Doctor, how is he? He's going to be fine. Thank goodness. It's just a shoulder fracture and at his age, it's going to take some time and therapy. - Therapy. - Yes. I need to warn you. Therapy can be expensive, so I suggest you start the paperwork with the insurance company now. OK? I'll speak to you later. Thanks. Insurance. Oh, the look on Ms. Gateland's face. It was worth trouble I'm going to get into. It was great! Stand and deliver. [giggling] (IN A HIGH VOICE) I beg your pardon. I'm a lady. [giggling] Sometimes the taunting of a wench makes for good sport. Stand and deliver. What's this here? It's sort of a treasure map. Have you been holding out on me, boy. Huh, uh. It's not what you think. It's a map from a guy you never heard of. He wasn't a seafaring man, but he certainly was an adventurer. Nobody's never been able to figure out all these symbols and squiggles. Well you see this? This means a rise in the land. And this means a buried stone. How did you know that? We adventurers have a language all our own. How you doing. You got everything you need? I've got more attendants than the World Series. Well, if you're sure you're going to be OK, I'd kind of like to get back to the house. Don't worry about me. Go on. I'm sure Bobby could use a little company right about now. See, right over there's the rise. And we're due east of the cut. You have a good eye, my boy. My grandpa hit a big rock with the plow here somewhere. Here it is, Captain, the buried stone. As it is on the map. Turn it over. The treasure is 130 paces that way. How did you know that? I know, adventurers have a language of their own. If there be true treasure here, Jim. We could be sharing as equals in a king's ransom, we could. We would be partners? We would be mates. Mates! One, two, three-- Really, mates? --six, seven, eight. You may loose your cutlass on my bare neck if it be not so. 12-- All right, mates! Cool! 15. Yeah, Jim, cool. 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130. You're still on 127. You double counted. My legs are longer than yours. This be it, boy. Now to find the spine of Chermain. Spine of Chermain? Hey, what are you doing? Stop. This is my dad's shed. Your dad will never know. Jezebel Jack, lures us into his black heart. By all that is holy. Save us from this demon! You yellow livered swine. Jack's had our booty too long. He'll welcome his sons. Hold tight, mates. Secure that rigging, you swums. This is no earthly curse. Father, dearest to my heart, save us! [men screaming, wind blowing] [crash] [men screaming] [creaking] Get me down! Help me. Ah! Behold. The Spine of Chermain. One, two, three, four, five, six. Is this it? Dig. How do you know? The x on the map. Dig. Go on. Let me help you, my friend. I hope you are not hurt Hey, are you seamen still alive? We're broken but we breathe. Uh, Captain. I'm tired of playing treasure hunt. Let's outside and play walk the plank. I assure you, that game is no fun at all, Jim. Dig on. Dig on. [thuds] I found something, Captain. I really found something. You did? Yeah, yeah, it's right here. It's iron, is it, Jim? It's the right size? Step aside, boy. This is man's work. It's a field. That's all. It be a field. Look. There's a house in the field. That house contains demons. It sits in an in the Sea of Sargasos. Such a gob wit. You chew too much ginko weed. It's a bloody field. That's all. Look, dirt, grass. A bunny rabbit. A bunny rabbit. Shut up! Right, Murzol, over the sides. Have a walk around. Oh, no. It'll swallow us up like that quicksand that surrounds the Mayan temple. Oh, don't be a fool, Murzol. If you're so sure, you go. Aye, you go. Me? Uh, huh. If I go over the edge and something happens to me, who will be captain? Satan, for he is here. That's exactly the kind of negative talk that got us here in the first place. Yeah! I knew it! I knew it! This ain't that chrome mental, is it? Nope. That's old silver, all right. It was stolen off the train by Jesse James and buried right here. Well, he aren't getting any of it back. It's mine now, every sweet silver bar of it. Now, you aren't about to tell this Jesse fellow what we found, are you? He's dead. Clubbed him, did you? Good lad. No, he was shot by Mr. Ford. So, it's just you and me then. Mate. The problem is I don't see any way that Glenn Jennings can possibly pay any interest on this note, let alone the principle. We're carrying her. Theo, I don't know why you're so insistent that we take action on the Jennings farm. We would only have to auction the property off. Look, Bob. I'm only worried about you and the bank. If the regulators knew about the history of this loan, and now that Raymond Jennings is in the hospital. Look, I just don't see any way that there's going to be a happy ending to this. That be him, it is. And that slime of a squid's belly has the treasure as well. He must have made a pact with the devil to live so long. He is the devil. Don't you start now. Now, Jim, we need to find a really good hiding place for my treasure, for our treasure. There be many a greedy lot out there who would want to lift it from us. We can load it in the four wheeler cart. Four wheeler? Trust me. Well, that I do, Jim. Now, Jim, how can I trust you if you don't hold up your end? Hey, Captain, look at that! That's a pirate ship. Blast! That scum will follow me to my grave. Come on, lad. We'll need to prepare for the battle. That's a real pirate ship, a pirate, a really real pirate. Adventurer. Come on. Mr. Ruse, prepare battle stations. Battle stations? Yes, Mr. Ruse. We're going to fire on that cursed house. With our cannons? Yes, with our cannons. [inaudible] Lock and load! Be warned. Do not bring harm to a chief. I'm bloody tired of being double crossed by that seaweed scoundrel. We're going to blast that house into the sand, collect our treasure, and be seeing what's left of the bodies. The captain has a habit of surviving such campaigns. Then he will feel the scrape of my blade on his gnarly throat. Why don't you take a rest and find a happy place? Happy place. Happy place. Happy place. Behold the Delilah, her sides a repetition of cannon menace. She'll soon deliver ball and shot through this flimsy frame. We're going to send in our Air Force to retaliate. Air Force, you say, Jim. It'll take more than wind to stop these black dogs. They've been under me own tutelage for three years past. She'll be squandering her balls soon. You know, Captain, if something happens to either one of us, I want you to know that you're my best friend. Well now you be talking with devils in your head. I'm an old seafaring man, with no friends at all. It's not for one such as I. Nevertheless, by my honor, I will stick by you when those mutineers come for you. And I by you, with no regrets. Really? You'll stay here and Never leave? Till the sun bleaches my bones white. All right, stand easy. Jim, she's about to loose her cannons parade. Fire! [explosions] The house! Hit the house. It's the biggest thing in the field. Oh. See I told you. [inaudible] [explosions] Fire! Stop! That's more like it, ladies. Mr. Murzol, reload. Reload, lads. Prepare another round. How do you like that, Jackie boy? On the edge, double breach. Go on, go on, hurry. Smoke him out. Fire! Lost all sense of direction. They fall apart without proper leadership. [moaning] Captain. Captain, are you all right, Captain. All right. You would imagine I would have taught those wags to shoot better. Don't worry, Captain. We have not yet begun to fight. Quite profound, Jim. Quite. One more volley, mates, and we burn her to the sand she sits on. When I tell you to, throw it out the window. You'll not have to encourage me to do that. Ready? Ready. [buzzing] A flying fire. The boy must be possessed. Or sent my the Author himself. 'Tis a wooden seagull. Shoot it down with the pistols. Surely, one of the evil spirits. Seeks you out, DeGroot. Reload and fire, Mr. Ruse. No. Pull it down, you swabs, before she catches the main mast. Tear it down. Coming down, sir. Suey! Put it out! You heard him. Put it out. You heard him. I did. You'll burn me ship. Yeah! [laughing] Oh, Jim, you be a clever skink of a lad. Look at the deck. She leaps with flames and fury. Come on! Move it! Bring the water! Hey, I'm here. I'll move it right now, OK? Come on, give me a break. I had to take my father to the hospital. Yeah, I heard it all before. Have a nice day. It's a Nor'easter. This may be the smile of fate. Mr. Murzol! Captain.
