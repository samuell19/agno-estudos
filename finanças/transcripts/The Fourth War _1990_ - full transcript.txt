What the hell kind of a salute, do you call that, Sergeant? Sir... Do you know the origin of the salute, Sergeant? No, sir. In the days of chivalry, when two Knights met on the road... they raised the visors of their helmets, it meant peace. If they lowered them, it meant war. Why don't you try that salute again... and put something more into it, besides your stump. First turn, on your right. Last building on your right. Sir. Thank you. Gentlemen, Major, Look... I don't want to get into an arguement, with military council, alright? Jack Knowles was a hard-ass. I'll give you that. But, only with his senior officers. His men thought, he was one helluva' leader. And for two very simple reasons. He knew his job and he was a warrior. Good afternoon, Sir... Colonel Knowles, knew how to fight a war. He breached with more ambush patrols, he hit hard, and returned with a minimum of casualities. Can I have a glass of water? Thank you. But, there's no denying, there was a problem. Lieutenant Colonel Foster, the executive officer. Maybe, it was because his marriage failed or... maybe, it was the war. Atten-Hut! However, there's not a classroom from here, to Fort Benning... that teaches a course on, the Art of Defeat. So, the army's answer was, to put him in mothballs. An assignment so far out of the way, you couldn't find him on a map. But, when we met last summer, he had done an about-face... and brought every indication, that he had his shit together. So, I gave him a command in Camp Clayton. Now, it's hardly the glamour as a NATO counselor, but, I wanted to get him back to doing what he does best. Leading troops. To figure his way out of obscurities. He dug his way out of a theory, alright, but,... it wasn't what I had in mind. What's the problem, sergeant? What's the problem? Clogged fuel line, sir. Happens all the time. No, big deal. No, big deal, huh? This Trac is leading this convoy. If it breaks down under fire, it's all our asses' in a shit hole. -You got that? -Yes, sir. All right. Fix it! -Move it out! -Yes, sir. It's seems unfortunate, sir, but uh, the sense of responsibility seems now, to be a thing of the past. -That business back there with the Trac... -You can't blame those kids! It's the Instructors they got. You can't teach them combat discipline, if you haven't given them any combat. It's a joke. How did you get your commission, Colonel? Academy, sir. Class of '70. West Point, huh? Brass factory. It was my grandmother's doing. She figured the only way to get to the top, was to start there. I take it, grandma never heard of evolution, huh? Well, she heard about it, sir, but, she fought back. She made a fortune marketing a creme rinse... that claimed to straighten black folks hair. Who won? Evolution, sir. After 10 days, over half of the customers finally found out. So, she gave up the fight and switched to wigs. Stop here. Listen up! Smoke 'em, if you got 'em. Want to give me an overview, as to what's going on over there? Yes, sir. Well, what we have, is a typical Eastern blocked border. However, there is one puzzling item in the pass. The Czech's can advance into neutral territory. Right up to our blue border markers. Of course, if they were pursuing someone. We don't have a reciprocal agreement. Why would we want one? Who the hell would want to go over there? Well, sir. You're right, of course Blue for us, red for them. Well, that's clear enough. Nothing else is very clear, anymore. Do you know what a guy told me on the flight coming over here? They're bringing American football to Moscow. I don't know. Maybe, I'm out of whack. Look! Czech defector, making a run for it. Paul! Hey, man! Check it out! Help this man out! Come on! -Shit, man! You can do it! -Let's do it! Take it home, man! Take it home! Oh, no way! Oh, shit! Do your best! -Aw, man! Come on! -Keep coming! Keep on coming! Yes! Yes! Come on, bro! Oh! No! No! Oh, man! They need five to catch him! Come on! Keep running! Keep coming! Sergeant! Prepare to engage enemy aircraft! What? You heard me, sergeant! Roger! Colonel, Lock it on, sergeant! Locked and loaded, sir! The Rules of Engagement don't allow... Stop doing my job or get the hell out of here! Oh, no! Let's get him! Colonel! No, sir! Just do your job! Lower those weapons! Put 'em down! Colonel! He must have played in the Cuban league. Company! Huggh! Duty Detail! Stand Fast! Huggh! Right! Face! Forward! March! Left! Right! Left! Right! Left! Right! Left!... Welcome, to Stuttgart, Colonel. Colonel. General. I'm off to Hamburg. Let's take a little walk. How are you, Roger? Good, Jack. What about you? Here we go again. Damn near started World War 3 out there. Some serious allegations have been filed, that tag you... as an irresponsible malcontent. -Can I see that report, sir? -Hell no. Scrapped it. I was the one who got you this assignment, remember. And you assured me, you could handle it, goddamn it. What the hell happened out there? They shot a man in cold blood, right in front of us. Well, not the Soviets. They don't do shit like that. He was shot by a Czech. I know they were Czechs. They played Czech and mouse with him, before they killed him. So, what the fuck else is new? Maybe, the guy was a criminal. Who the hell knows? It's different now, Jack. Them Czechs have got alot more freedom. They let 'em have passports... and shopping guides to Vienna, for christ sakes. And what about this shit, about you throwing a snowball at Colonel Robinson? I missed. The son-of-bitch threw one back. I don't have time for this shit, Jack. At least I got a feeling, that the next time... Yeah, well, you better get the feeling that things have changed... and you better change, too. Otherwise, you're going to be out on your ass. It's pick and shovel work now, no more heroics. You're a patrol officer, for all practical purposes. A patrol officer in a nunnary. You got that? Roger, I've been in the service half my life. I've learned to play on the white keys and the black keys. Now, I'm expected to play in the cracks? That's it exactly. That's just where we are right now. In the cracks. Excuse me. Excuse me. -Congratulations, to both of you. -Thanks very much, sir. -Congratulations. -Thank you. Many happy returns, sir. What does that mean? It's your birthday, sir. Have you forgotten? How did you know that? This is the date you were born, sir. Yes, I know that! But, how the hell did you know it? Sir, with all due respect, maybe, we can discuss this later. I want to know it now! -I happen to see your 201 file. -Snooping in my 201 file. -I wasn't snooping. -You damn well, were. You filed a report on me and you sent it to divisional headquarters didn't you? Sir, now, is not the time, or place... You filed a report on me outside of the chain of command. Now, I want to know under whose authority did you do that... and I want to know it now! Sir, first of all, you imbreached a regulation... Did you tell the General that the Russians came across the border? No you didn't. Did you tell the General that... the attack helicopter shot rocks in our face? No you didn't! Did you? Did you? Sir, if you allow me to finish. Please. And second of all, sir, and I hope you can appreciate this... we have gone through extraordinary lengths as not to be seen as an American. And finally, sir. You should know, that I was not merely snooping. And I certainly wasn't trying to louse up your authority. I was simply following orders. The General's orders. You've been hidden in the Far East... we have more of a public relations role to play here. Perhaps the General has explained this to you. I'd like to explain something to... Gentlemen, gentlemen. Or may I call you officer and gentlemen. If you don't mind? We are here to celebrate these happy days which belong to Dwayne and Hannelore. With deep respects. I'm sorry, about this whole thing. Knowles here. Yeah, operator. That's right. Dexter Academy. Huh? In Vermont, yeah. You got him? Well, put him on. Hey... Timmy! Ohh... How are ya? Huh... Ha, ha. Of course it's me. You got some other old man, stationed in West Germany? Huh? Wait, wait, wait, you gotta talk louder, I can't hear you. What's that racket? Music. Look, you guys are suppose to be studying, at this hour. Huh? Ahh... that's what it's about. Me? I'm fine. But, but... listen, listen. Do you know what day this happens to be? Huh? Tuesday. Yeah, it's Tuesday, alright. But, it also happens to be my birthday. Yeah. No, no, no, that's alright. I... Listen, no, no. I forgot it, too. Yeah. I forgot my own birthday. Your mother? No. We haven't talked, in about 4 years. But listen, listen, how's the little guy? How's Bobby? How's my little, Bobby? What did he think of that bike I sent him, huh? Mm... hm. Mm... hmm. In the school yard? You mean, they just walked up to him and took it away? And he didn't do anything about it? Well, Jesus H. Christ! I don't care, if it was three to one. Shot them? What do you mean, I would have shot them? That supposed to be funny? A few drinks? Is that what you call it? Let me give you an education, pal. Colonel Knowles, was whacked out of his skull. He had been tying one on, from the moment he got into the base. And let me tell you something else... even if he'd been stone cold sober, he still would have done it. It was a challenge he had to accept. Gentlemen, look at it this way... we all know, we're talking about a man who's trained... to react, do you understand? Conditioned! Drilled into him. From the day, he hit basic training, he was told... Hey, that's the enemy, bucko! Go get him! Jack Knowles, is a soldier, for christ sakes! Not, some candy-ass diplomat, whose got his suit inside out. without taking his hands out of his pockets. Look at his war record! You think every one had a good time in Vietnam? Talking with CBS news? Colonel Knowles, crossed that border because he was looking to get even. He loves me. He loves me not. He loves me. He loves me not. Drop 'em. Drop 'em! Sprechen Sie Deutsch? Neither do I. -What's that? -Jes radio. Ahh... ...smart boy. I'll take that. I've got sons' your age, who can't even speak their own language. At least, not to me. Here we are. The 14 foot tall giants of modern combat. The troops... who everybody knows, that are the best soldiers in the world. In all of my military career, you guys have been hanging over my head. Kneel down! Good. You won't be needing them. Now, boys. Put these on. Put 'em on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Hurry up! We haven't got all night! Hustle it up! This is a once in a year event, do you know that? Here. Gimme that. I like that one. Now... my name is Knowles. Jack Knowles. Colonel Knowles. Say it... Knowles... Knowles... Jack Knowles, Colonel Jack Knowles. I want you to remember that. So, you can report it to your Colonel Valachev. Huh? Huh? Hey... Now... Listen. Listen. Today, is my birthday. And we're going to celebrate it, in song. -In English? -Das li... Do you comprende, das li? You're going to sing me "Happy Birthday." And I don't care in what language you sing it in... just so long as you don't forget Jack Knowles, okay? Jack Knowles. Got that? Alright, now. Here, we go. All together now. Repeat, after me. Ready? Sing! That was nice. Now, we got to blow out the candles. It just helps to blow out the candles. It's bad luck, if you don't blow out the candles. Aww... too late! Sergeant Major! Sir! Sergeant Major, who ordered this? Colonel Knowles did, sir. And when was it installed? Last night, sir. Actually, early this morning, sir, at 01:30 hours. He had the Alert Force put it in. Thank you, Sergeant Major. That'll be all. Very well, sir. Come on people, this ain't no rest home. A real beauty, isn't she? You know, it's sorta like carrying coal in Newcastle. I purchased that car in Indiana and brought it over here. Have you ever driven one of those? Never have, sir. Well, that one is known to be a little tricky in tight corners, but, other than that, it's a great car. Maybe, we'll go for a spin some day. You know, Colonel, I decided to... forget about that matter the other day. That report you sent to headquarters it was dismissed... in fact, it ended up in the shredder. You didn't do yourself much good there. You were not a success. As I have trouble coping with sudden failure... I'll just do my best to forget the incident as well, sir. Good. Sir, we got the word, that you were missing. Sir! What? That's what it said, sir. Colonel Clark, ordered a search party. He said, you were missing. Do I look missing? Good afternoon, sir. Follow me. Yes, sir. You put out an Alert on me? The jeep you were driving was found by a patrol, sir. It was on fire and you weren't in it. What the fuck are you up to, Clark? I was concerned about your safety, sir. I thought something had happened to you. The jeep caught fire, that's all. The patrol said, that the... The jeep caught fire, period! I suppose you reported this to Division as well? Yes, sir, I did. Is that what they teach you at the Point? Not specifically, sir. They teach you to develop your skills to a level where... mistakes are things other people make. -One, two, three, four! -One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! -One, two, three, four! -One, two, three, four! I'm looking for the Colonel. I've not seen him, sir. Do you know, if he slept here last night? I don't reckon he was here, sir. His bed wasn't slept in. Please, let me go. They will kill me. Who's they? Come on! Wake up. We have to go. The patrol just went by. You went out like a light. I'm sorry. You must have needed it. Yes. I don't know who you are... but, you'd better not pull a stunt like that again. You've seen these border guards are serious. Do you understand, what I'm talking about? I understand. I used to live there. How'd you get here in the first place? -Bus. -Bus? They don't allow buses on the border. I came by the bus, from Regensburg. And in Diefenbach, I... Hitch-hiked. That's what I did. You lived in Regensburg? I work in Regensburg. For three years, now. I used to live in Prague. Prague? Well, if that's where you're headed, you better find a different route. Because, if it's this way, you're only going to get shot. I must go back to Czechoslovakia. And they must not know I'm coming. It's a political situation. And my little girl is there. She has no one to take care of her. Who's taking care of her now? My mother, but she is ill. She cannot anymore. No one else you can ask? There is no one. Nothing. Get in the car. These communist countries will take the responsibility... whether you like it or not. Whether you like it or not? Sounds wonderful. I didn't say it was wonderful. Would you want them to take your daughter? Look, I just think things are better now, that's all. And do you believe it? No. I think it's bullshit. It is bullshit. Big bullshit. Here. Drink this. This is my number at the base. Call me, if you need any more help. And for god's sake, don't come across that border again. There is no other way. If there was, I would have done it long ago. Why do you have to do this? In Prague, I did translations. For the Revolutionary Underground Press. We published a newspaper. Prominent Student Youth Committee. Committee to get rid of the Soviets. It is a printing village, which is outside the city... to avoid detection. One night, we arrived at the press at the house of a friend. The police were there. Waiting for us. I was able to escape, but, I had to leave the country at once. " Capiche? " Yes, I understand. And I'm very very sorry, but... I can't help you. I wish you and your daughter, much luck. But Colonel, could you not...? Believe me. I can't. -GO! GO! -GO FOR IT! Yay! Yay! It should be done like this! Yay! Yay! Good afternoon, General. Welcome onboard, sir. Clark. Gentlemen, I apologize for taking you away from the game, but, my schedule was bird-dogged by a storm... that's been screwing my ass all the way from Frankfurt. So, Clark. Carry on, Sergeant Major. Everybody, enjoy the day. Where's Colonel Knowles? In his quarters, sir. I've been reading your report, Colonel. Yes, sir. -You're a West Pointer, right? -Class of '70, sir. Well, that's a little after me. -Who sponsored you? -Senator Jordan of Maryland, sir. -No shit. -That's right. Sam Jordan? Oh my god! Sam and I go way back. We used to chase the ladies together. Met his new wife, Mary Beth? Haven't had the pleasure, sir. She's the balls of the family, now. Old Sam told me, when he got remarried to that Mary Beth... half his age, it would really straighten his ass out. The Senator was never anything, but, straight with me, sir. Well, alright. General. Jack. Thank you, Colonel. That's not the Jack Knowles I ever remember. We'll have that cleaned up right away, sir. Will coffee do? It would be fine, Jack. They're keeping you busy, huh? That's right. Back to Frankfurt, then on to Stuttgart by 17:30. Never a second to stop moving. There was a time when I could relax. Take in a little golf... sleep til noon on Sunday's. Now, my wife, you met, Rachel? Mm... hmm. Well, she is insisting that I attend church. Even got me to read the bible. Right up there, in front of the whole damn congregation. So, I decided, I'd better brush-up a little bit on the Good Book. And I found myself, trudging through all those " begets." In the book of Genisis. Then I thought of you. I don't understand. " Begets, " Jack. The past tense of " beget." It means, to produce "off-spring." Abraham beget Isaac, Isaac beget... it's all there... It's in the beginning of the Bible, Jack. Don't you read your Bible? I always thought, that a man of your spirit, in spirit, would have it within arm's reach. Night and day. What's your point, Roger? Who do you think, "beget" you, Jack? Well, if I don't know, you're going to tell me. Vietnam. You're the off-spring of the war in Vietnam. Now, mind you, you're not the only one. But, war, also "begets" loonies. And cowards... and big heroin trafficker's. Iowa farm boys, with their first dose of "crack." But, most important, it "beget" heroes. And you are one of them. No, no, no, you are a hero, Jack. Most definitely. And I can attest to that. Because, you put your life on the line for me... many times under my command. Do you want to know something? I've been trying to save your life, ever since. I don't see what your driving at, Colonel. Like shit, you don't. You can't be trusted for five minutes. You've been shuffled through the army, more times, than a deck of cards! Bangkok, Manila, ...Guam! And on each and every assignment, you caused trouble. You can't be referring to the jeep? Of course, I'm referring to the god damn jeep! You war mongering, son-of-bitch! It exploded! It caught fire! IT EXPLODED!! I have the evidence. It was shelled by a rocket propelled grenade. RPG fragments were found in the fuel tank. I didn't know that. You're a god damn liar. And you also know, who did it, don't you, Colonel. Becuse there is only one army, on the face of god's green earth... who uses rockets, like some old lady uses suppositories... and that's the armed forces of the U.S.S.R. You see, right over there, where I am pointing... there's another hero... just like you... but, he didn't go to Vietnam. He went to Aftghanistan. And it was a fucking mess. And when he got home, nobody came out to cheer him. And he thought, what did I bust my ass for? Why didn't I die and Boris loose a leg? So, now we got, two disillusioned, pissed off heroes. And I can understand that, because I am disillusioned and pissed-off. But I do not understand... and will not tolerate... two malcontent... who think they have the right... to start their own private little dress war... while the rest of us poor sons-of-bitches... are in danger of being turned into French fries. What then? Send them an apology? Too late, for that shit. After the investigation, you're going to be god damn lucky if you're not apologizing to a General Court Martial. If that happens, Jack, I'm not going to have any room to maneuver in your behalf. The most I'm going to be able to do, at best... is to keep you out of Leavenworth. And buy you a subscription to Soldier of Fortune magazine. Knowles. Clark here, sir. While you were having your meeting with, General Hackworth... Miss Elena called. She didn't leave a number, she said, you would know how to reach her, yourself. That's it, sir. ... across the border. Sit down, Private. Before, you fall down. Oh, Colonel, I was... Can I speak to you for a moment, please. What are trying to do? Involve that kid? Colonel, I was not. -I was explaining... -Don't lie to me, I saw you. You tried to get him, to take you across the border. I was not. He's only a kid, for christ sakes. The only place he is going to take you, is to a Senior Prom. I do not know what I am doing, anymore. No, I think you don't. Why do you not help me? You're always looking for some battlefield. Why do you not fight on what could save a life? I do not want to. But, I must. Because, I want to see my daughter. There's nothing I can do. How much for that room? Good evening. Good evening. You've been making such a habit of coming to me. I thought it was my turn, to return the compliment. And meet this fine example of the American fighting forces. As a witness to this encounter. You see, I have made a study of your Commander's career. And believe me, there are no surprises. Your commanding officer, is a joke. There's a name for him at the divisional headquarters. His wife has a name for him, too. I think that's just about enough. When I'm done, Colonel, then, it's enough. This is the Colonel's, Czechoslovakian whore. She's looks good for the part, don't you think. You really should look for more honest work. Why don't you clean the spot off my boot. Clean it! Until you can see your face on them! What's it like with him? Was it sad? Very pathetic. Now, listen to me, Colonel. If you come over the border, one more time... you're never going to get back. Because, I.. personally, will kill you. What happened? Well, we searched the room again. The same old story. We only found uh.. personal effects with some .............. As a matter of fact, we found out hardly anything at all. What the hell is wrong with you, Hector? I was just afraid, right when the guy pointed a gun at my head. If you had a little bit of confidence, you gotta be alright. -Sergeant, this way. -Yes, sir. contact Division, I need transportation to Stuttgart, immediately. -Did they find his Porsche, sir? -No, but we will. We did find out alot about his life, back at his quarters. -Sergeant, full up. -Yes, sir. This is the church. You'll be safe here. I'll be fine. Nobody uses it anymore. I'll just stay indoors and sing a few hymns. I won't be long. My little girl is at school, which is not far. Stay right on the main road, by the town hall, just past the collections. I understand. I'll see you then. Soon. I'll be here. About time. Well, it's all over for him then, isn't it? You know... one time in Vietnam... we were fighting in the highlands out of Ban Me Thout... when Jack was wounded. I went out to see how he was doing. And on his pillow, was a medal. Son of a gun, I said, he won an award as the Distinguished Service Cross. and he opened his eyes the first time in days and he said... I don't give a god damn what kind of medal, he said. just so long as I don't die in a shirt with one of those... little alligators on the front. Well, Clark, you take over his command. at least, until we get this shit straightened out. Recommendation, full Colonel. Thank you, sir. You brought me one hell of a day, Clark. Can't wait for the sun to go down. And painful, as it is to conflict we're expected to do something to save the situation. We get to act like we never heard of him. Just keep driving, until we get across that border. I could not... Don't get upset with her. She was just doing her job. You're the one who blew it. And you blew it back at the Inn, when you called her... my little Czechoslovakian whore. She's a whore, alright. But, how did you know, where she was from? That's the 5 km fence. Why do you think they're guarding it? You will not cross it, without my permission. They will have your permission yet. Colonel Clark, sir, we got major movement up on the Czech' border. Are you positive, Corporal? Alright. It's Knowles. Son of a bitch! Muster, the Alert Force. No point. Do it, Sergeant Major. They fought with everything, that day. It was a battle, unique for it's time. With no regrets. When they were out of ammunition, they went for... anything, they could get their hands on. You know, I remember the Commandant of Cadets at West Point, telling me.. that Einstein, was onced asked, what type of weapons, would be used in World War III? And he said... I don't know. But, the Fourth War, will be fought with stones.
