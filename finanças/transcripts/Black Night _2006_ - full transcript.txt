Long time no see. Why are you up so late? Mr. Ping! I just saw something terrible. You shouldn't pick up things in the street. They're dirty. Ms. Sung... Don't go wandering around the next few days. What happens in the next few days? It's the July Ghost Festival. Ghosts everywhere! I knew you'd missed me. Jane? Joe, I am back! Why were you opening somebody else's door? I was just joking around. I won't leave you again! We'll be together, now and forever. I'll be good and behave myself. Don't you trust me? How can I trust you? You left me once... you'll do it again. Are you upset with me? You said you'd wait for me. So what if I did? You went to Taiwan and changed your mobile number. Jane... don't be like this. Listen to me... I just want to tell you how much I missed you these 3 months. I was afraid you don't want me anymore. How could I dump you? Look at me... Take a deep breath, watch me. breathe in, breathe out... Feel any better? You still get tense so easily. Did you follow the doctor's instructions? Did you take your medicine daily? What's that noise? Nothing. Maybe a rat. Let's go inside. What was that you threw away? Nothing. Get in. When I left, I swore each time I thought of you. I'd prick myself with a needle. But now I know that you are all I ever want. Will we be together forever? I love you till eternity. You always sound so convincing. I'm telling the truth. -What's the matter? -I warn you! If you break your promise, there'll be retribution. This is you. Sometimes you're so gentle. and other times so short-tempered. Don't you find me exciting? We'll be together forever... even die together. Okay. From tomorrow, we will be together forever. Why tomorrow? Because tomorrow is a good start. Look, it's almost dawn. Get some sleep. Hosie... Please leave a message It's nothing. Just want to tell you I miss you. I miss you so much. -Mister. -No matter what happens... I will always be with you. Put down the knife. Easy, man. It's fine... Give me your handcuffs. -Don't move! -Steady! What's wrong with you? Where are your handcuffs? I left them at my neighbour's. You walking on the wild side, huh? Jane's the wild one. She came back from Taiwan yesterday. What about your Nanjing lover? Sure you can handle this? Beware of dire consequences! I can't return home, please help me. I can't return home, please help me. Help me. Please help me, I can't go home. What's wrong? This is not your home! I'm catching a flight tonight. I must go home for my luggage. I left all my stuff at home. I must leave tonight. I spent ages saving the money. Did you forget your keys again? The keys? My boyfriend took them. He promised to come back for me. No. He left the keys with me. Is he Joe? Joe. He promised he'd come back for me. Joe won't come back for you because I am back. No. We made love twice last night. No... Don't play spooky with me! Want to play? OK! "Sorry! The station suddenly called yesterday" "I can't come back for you, don't be mad" "Miss you, Joe" Hosie... Don't be mad at me. I got an urgent case, so I couldn't come back. But I missed you a lot yesterday. I did. I promise I will wait for you. You are messing about with me. Everyone is. Come out! Don't hide! Come out! Come out! Don't scare me! Don't play spooky! Thank you. I'm home at last. But I can't go to New York anymore. Why? It's just 5 minutes. Don't go tomorrow. Stay for one more month, okay? One more month makes no difference. My semester is about to start. Will you think of me in New York? -Yes. -You sure? I wouldn't lie to you. I remember my deeds. and of course, the man I love. Come on. Just for me, okay? The world is too big for you to understand me. I can't give up what I want for others. What are you doing? -Now you cannot leave. -What's this? You are under arrest. Silly, I've to go. I'll chop off my hand to escape. Whose hand? Your hand? I'll miss it. Maybe you'll be the one to chop it off. What do you want? I won't let you get hurt. -I will wait for you. -I don't believe you. If you wait, you wouldn't beg me to stay behind. Okay. Unlock the handcuffs first. Don't be a fugitive. I'll be back in 5 minutes. The key is in the handcuffs. I'll be back in 5 minutes. I don't want to die. Joe! Jane... Why are you here? Hosie... We were just playing with handcuffs. -You killed her. -How come she's drowned... -She has turned into a ghost! -Why? -Run! -Why? I've been handcuffed. Hold the knife... on the handcuffs! Don't move! Run... Run! Jane! Are you okay? Jane! Jane! Jane... it's Joe! Jane... Jane! It's fine... Quick! Answer the phone to ask for help! Be quick! Hello, we from Next World Telecom... Help! Go back to hell... Why should I be the one to die? Run! Jane... Joe... Open the door! I don't want to stay here. You promised to come back in 5 minutes. Joe! Joe! Let him go! It is not his fault! If you'd come back, I would not have died! It was my fault! If I hadn't come back, you'd have been alive. Kill me instead! No! Jane! Hosie! It's not Jane's fault! It's mine! Let her go. I'll pay my dues to you. I didn't keep my promise to come back. I caused your death. I promised we'll be together. Let go of her. I won't lie to you again. Promise me! Don't kill Jane. No. We swore we'd die together. I promised not to let her die. Hello, I want the earliest flight to New York tomorrow. Madam, please give me your full name Just a moment. My name is Yee Chen Sung. Yee Chen Sung. "Dark Hole" Yuki. Did you have another nightmare last night? That same one? Sorry. Did I wake you up? We talked about this the other day. Why don't you go to see a psychiatrist? I'm not crazy. Everyone has experienced recurring dreams, right? If you think like that. you're going to keep having nightmares, forever. Well, you might be right. I will go sometime soon. Thank you. Welcome! This is for you. Have a lovely time... Yuki? You know that guard, Asai? He's been missing from work for days. What? Mr. Asai? You two were dating, weren't you? I was wondering if you knew anything about him. The director of the aquarium seems to be worried about him. How would I know? Besides, it's been awhile since I broke up with him. I see. Well then, sorry. What? Look, there's still one visitor here. Excuse me. The aquarium is closing now. Is something wrong? Where did that boy in the yellow sweatshirt go? About this tall. He was just here. What? There is no one here. Just three of us. What's going on with you? Are you all right? I am sorry. I think I am just tired. I better get going. Good night. See you tomorrow... You're having the same nightmare over and over, right? Yes. You've said you vaguely recall things from your dreams. Sometimes we forget things. but they are still buried in our subconscious. Let's go back to your childhood. to see if we can find out more about that boy. Are you ready? Please relax. Take a deep breath. You will gradually feel relaxed. Now, let's slowly rewind the clock. A year ago, 3 years ago. when you were in high school, middle school. ten years old, nine years old. -Idiot! -Give it back to me! Come and get it if you can! Idiot! Who cares? Get it yourself. Here it is. Hyu... Yuki? Be quiet. Yuki What are you doing? What is that? Show it to me! Stop it!! You'll scare Hyu. What are you talking about? There's nothing in here. Mum, can't you see it? Where did you get that? Why is it here? I don't want that in my house. Throw it away! I will throw it away. Yuki! Give it to me... Then, what did you do with Hyu? I took it back to where it used to be. I went to see Hyu secretly on my way home from school. I fed it everyday. Then, Hyu grew up. How big did it become? As big as my mum. That big? What? Somebody, help! Please, help me! No! Now you started to see your co-worker, Mr. Asai, right? You had a relationship with Asai before, didn't you? Yes. I'd been with him until the spring before last. Why did you break up with him? He was cheating on me with his ex-girlfriend. I can never forgive things like that! Mum. Yuki... Yuki. Are you all right, Yuki? Satoshi. What's wrong? She was there... my mum. It's all right, Yuki. Nobody is here. Don't be afraid. I am here with you. Mr. Karatani. Did you know that Yuki lost most of her childhood memories? Yes, she told me about it. Did you know that Yuki had a pet when she was young? No. It was something indescribable. She called it Hyu. Hyu? This is the first I've heard of it. Does it have something to do with Yuki's delusions? Probably. This is only my hypothesis... but it seems Yuki suppresses her emotions. due to stress from childhood trauma. I suspect she created an imaginary creature named Hyu. as a substitute for her repressed emotions. Have you heard of multiple personality disorder? Yuki's is an exceptional case. Patients like this will project their emotions. onto something which is not human. Something very destructive. Something with the power to hurt other people. Doctor, can that be true? Yuki? No way! Pay careful attention to every single signal from Yuki. I need your help to treat Yuki's condition. Yuki. It can't be true. Let me know immediately when Yuki acts strangely. Even in the slightest way. Hello? Is this Dr.Kawai? It's Karatani, sorry to bother you so late. I wanted to talk about Yuki's mother. Yes. I went back home to look secretly into her stuff today. I found something strange. Yes. It's a newspaper article about her mother's accident. I'd never seen it before. "Mystery of the drowned housewife" "Missing Notice" Hello, this is Kawai speaking. Hello. This is Karatani. May I speak with Dr. Kawai? I'm sorry to make you come to a place like this. Not at all, what's wrong? You can always see me at the clinic anytime. Doctor. Why did you tell Satoshi about Hyu? Everything is for your treatment. I needed his help to cure your condition. It's my treatment. It has nothing to do with Satoshi. Yuki, you have dissociative identity disorder. You've created the second personality. and are unconsciously using it to take action for you... You don't believe me. Do you? I asked you to come here. because I wanted you to know that Hyu really exists. Hyu is... in here. Yuki, you told me that Yamashita bullied you in elementary school. Do you remember that he died around here? I didn't know. Why do you ask me things like that? What? There's nothing here! What do you have? Give it to me. Stop it! -What did you put in there? -Stop it! -There's nothing here... -Stop it! No! It wasn't me! So, you remember when your mother passed away. I have heard your mother was strict with you. after she got a divorce from your father. You must have had a hard time then. I know nothing about it. You are lying. This is nonsense! Give it to me! Yuki! Give it to me! Such mistreatment from someone who you trust the most. can carve a deep scar, a wound that left a hole in your heart. Do you think that could have triggered Hyu's appearance? No! I'm not accusing you of anything. I just want you to recall. You are separated into two personalities. We have to join them back together. Take a look at this picture. Mr. Asai was found dead the other day. He was found on the riverside around here... just like your mother and Yamashita. Your colleague said that Asai's been. pestering to get back together with you. No. I didn't do it! It's all because of Hyu! Yuki, listen to me. You are Hyu! Stop it! Yuki! Satoshi. Are you alright, Yuki? What's going on? What happened, Yuki? I didn't kill him, Satoshi. It's not me. Yuki. Why? No. It's not me. Please listen to me! You're not going to tell me that Hyu did it, are you? I trusted you. I wanted to believe you. Believe me. I didn't do it! Look! There is Hyu. Satoshi! No! It's not me! Yuki, get a hold of yourself! Stop it! Hyu, Hyu is coming! Listen to me! Hyu doesn't exist! Please! Don't shout at me! Cut it out! You made everything up! It's only your delusion! I shouldn't have met you. Don't. No! Don't! Don't leave me! No! Get away! Stop it... "The Lost Memory" Prang has suffered severe brain concussion. It's caused her to lose part of her memory. Imagine that... several pages in a book had been ripped out. and now you can't connect the whole story. She still has a chance to regain her memory.
