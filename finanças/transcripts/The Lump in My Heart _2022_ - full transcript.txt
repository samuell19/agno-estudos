What? Where is it? Mom! Where's my green T-shirt? I washed it. Why didn't you ask me first? You don't do your own laundry. How many minutes? How long did you toast them? Why? Three minutes as usual. You're kidding. They're burnt. - That too? - What do you mean? The washing machine is acting up. Household appliances break all at once. I'll eat this. I don't have time. You could've slept in if you'd chosen a local university. A lousy reason to choose a university, my first step into the future. Transportation costs money. We'll die before you step into the future. This isn't edible. (The Lump In My Heart) Good morning. This is Mr. Kimura who I told you about. He's the new section chief in the public affairs team. Section Chief Kimura, a word, please. Okay. Hello. I'm Motoharu Kimura. There's a lot I'd like to talk about but... As they say about skirts and speeches, the shorter, the better. Um... That was a joke. Anyway... I have a lot to learn about this business... You're frozen. Did you get the chills? (Summer break project - Write a novel about memories of first love) It doesn't have to be good writing. The point is to find a unique story that only you can tell. With that in mind, complete a novel during your summer break. You all have your own unique experiences. They become a part of you as a person and will help you grow as a writer. Hey, Chinatsu. Hey. Long time no see. I never see you on campus. You're a lit major, right? Yeah. I'm working on a project. I'm surprised you chose an art college. You wanna be a novelist? Well... Sort of... You should say it outright. Putting it in words helps it come true. By the way... I'm gonna be in a play. Come watch your childhood friend. Of course. I'll see you around. Hold on. I'm thinking about moving out and getting my own apartment. But rent costs money. Nothing beats living at home. Yeah, but... I was wondering if you'd help me look for an apartment. Sure. When I have time. Thanks. Talk to you later. See ya. You influenced her to choose an art college. Huh? Me? The books and movies you lend her are so artsy. But you were ecstatic when she was accepted. Listen. My joy was snuffed out by the reality called money. You just sounded like a writer. Chinatsu has your DNA. Yeah, right. Hello. May I join you? Okay? Excuse me? Sorry. Forget it. No problem. But we're having a private conversation. Right. Your intonation is wrong. It's "okay?" - "Okay?" - No, no, no. "Okay?" "Okay?" Try it. Okay? - Okay? - Nope. Okay? (Health checkup result: additional test advised) I'm home. Hi. Grumpy. I was cleaning your room. Stay out of there. You're so disorganized. You forgot something important. Where did it go? You can't talk. Here it is. An additional test. You better take it soon. What's this? Your health checkup at the university. A detailed breast-cancer screening. It says any clinic. - I can take the 7th off work. - I can go by myself. I'm going with you. Leave the 7th open. Your change. Thank you. You're obstructing business. I might work at the circus. You're gonna be in a circus? They're hiring ushers. It's coming to town. I didn't know. You have to use a pen, not a colored pencil. Here. Come to the circus. I'll be there. No. Hello. I have some tickets to the circus. Hello. I have some tickets to the circus. May I? Yeah, sure. I have some tickets to the circus. Would you like to go? Mr. Kimura, those tickets will make things awkward between us. We'll feel pressured to go. Buy some cookies at the circus and hand them out. You don't have to try so hard to fit in. I feel like I'm getting scolded... by my mom. Give me a break. We're the same age. You're a year older... That's what I mean. Don't dwell on minor details. I'm sorry. But thank you anyway. Two. - We'll take two. - What? For me and Toko. We'll go if we can. Thank you. We'll go. Toko! Hi. You're glowing. University must suit you. No. I've always had this glow. And her baffling allegations continue. Get on. Hey. What's up? Hi. I'm going home. This is Toko, my mom's co-worker. A childhood friend who goes to the same university. I'm Kohki Kawayanagi. I study acting. Tohko Hanauchi. I'll call you. Um... If you have time... Here. Thanks. "Falstaff." "Falstaff Sweats." A comedy. - Shakespeare? - Yeah. Wow. It's a parody. See you around. Yeah. Bye. All right. Let's go. You already broke up with him? He's old news. What about you? - Any hotties at school? - None whatsoever. I mean... I've never had a boyfriend. You should find one. Being in love feels wonderful. Love is also nice but being in love is definitely more exciting. I always wonder if anyone buys this. When I imagine a tong around this bread, it reminds me of a mammography. Get one. A novel? We have to write a novel about our first love. When was your first love? Year 2 in middle school. But I was shocked when he said my boobs got bigger. He had a crush on you. But I get it. Guys notice those things. Yeah. It's like they suddenly look at you different. I was happy though. I wanted to be seen as an adult. But my mom... She wouldn't let me wear a bra. - Year 2 in middle school? - Yup. She finally bought me a sports bra the following year. But I'm sure her hands were full. She is a single mom after all. Hey! Ko-chan! Hello. What a long walk. You're back, huh? You walked? Yeah. I wasn't thinking. You weren't thinking? Oh... Wait. Better not waste it. A ticket to the circus. Circus? Watching the real thing will help you improve your acting. Uh... In what way? Don't ask me. I'm not an expert. But thanks. I'll go if I can. Come visit Chinatsu, okay? Of course. See you around. Hello. Hello. Here... What is it? Takashi borrowed a pen from Chinatsu. Because I might work at the circus. Circus? I got a ticket. - I might work there. - Okay, okay. He lost the pen he borrowed. Forget it. We don't want to cause any trouble. I didn't get a mammography. What? Breast-cancer screening. Ultrasound? The echo thing. Wait a sec... No. The freshmen's health checkup. It was an option and I took it. The test... kind of made me cry. The doctor was a middle-aged man. It was the first time a man touched my breasts. You're so sensitive. To doctors, they're just objects. Toko... Can I ask a weird question? Sure. How does it feel... when a guy you like touches your body? Let's see... I was here with an ex. We were having sex in a car. Then... we saw this wave of light in the sky. We thought it must be a UFO. We stopped doing it... and watched the light together. I wonder what that was. I think that's what it's like when a guy you like touches your body. Only tatami mats. Are you okay with that? Yeah? But you should have a regular room without tatami mats. I think it'd be better that way. The washing machine inside the room narrows down your choices. It could be outside then. Don't ignore your must-haves. Right. Okay. Walking distance? Within 15 minutes? That'd be nice but it's not a must. A wider selection if you're willing to walk 25 minutes. I am. Totally acceptable. A bus stop nearby would be nice. In that case... This is it. Take a look. - Thank you. - Hello... I'll go see the landlord. Nice. It smells like an apartment, not like the occupant. I could put the TV here. And the sofa over here. I'll lie down here when I come over. You'll get in trouble with the realtor when he comes back. Hey. Get up by yourself. You're heavy. Lie down with me. It's really comfortable. This summer's gonna be really hot. Yeah... What? You've never been to a circus? No. But you were trying to get everyone to go. - You? - Me neither. Seriously? It's exciting just to have a circus in town. I agree. I remember the anticipation in the classroom. And it's gone right away. Yeah. Only an empty lot remains. It felt so sad. I wonder why. Because it passed you by? That's it. You're absolutely right. It passed us by. That's one way to put it. Then you guys should go this time before it passes you by. Your mom gave me a ticket to the circus. She made me take it. A circus? How embarrassing. We're too old for it. You think? I might go. I'll be here the whole summer. - Really? - Yeah. - What happened? - Wait... I think a cicada pissed on me. Poor boy! Yuck... Smell it. This is disgusting. Ew! It stinks. - Get it off me. - No way! - I don't wanna touch it. - Get away from me. - No! - Please! Hi! What are you doing? How do I buy this? - Buy what? - Circus ticket. Toko wants to go as a welcome outing for the new section chief. I'll do it for you. Just one. Toko already has one. No. It's for me. You? Why? I was looking forward to it. You never told me. At my age, I don't tell you everything. An age that looks forward to a circus. An age that gets annoyed by a nagging mom. Is that right? Did you eat already? No. I wanna eat. We're going to the hospital tomorrow. I know. The lukewarm water in the plastic kiddie pool. The boys played around. We girls thought we were too old for it and watched them impassively. But truth be told, our hearts were dancing and we couldn't leave. Girls are no different. But I couldn't join them. If I uncrossed my arms, they'd know I wasn't wearing a bra. I didn't want him to see that. I haven't changed since then. "I still like him so much." "Hiding the swelling on my chest," "I still can't leave." Mom... Why are you so upset? The doctor made it sound like it's malignant. With an accurate diagnosis and the proper treatment, he said it'll go away. Why is this happening to you? Act normal. Don't make things worse until we get the result. You're right. We should go out for a nice dinner. Like crab we saw in the catalogue? Snow crab. It looked delicious, didn't it? But it's expensive. One of the four great crabs. Then crab sticks? No thanks. Another thing... Don't tell Toko. I don't want her to worry. I won't tell her or anyone else. Chinatsu? How've you been? - Long time no see. - What are you doing? I'm... taking a walk. Chinatsu, I didn't get the job at the circus. - Your friend? - Sort of. - What are you doing? - I'm working. - I didn't get the job. - I wasn't talking to you. Come shopping with us. - Not today... - How about tapioca? No... Are you going to the circus? - He wants to talk. - Are you following us? Let's go shopping. Let's eat tapioca first. The circus... Shut up! What's wrong? You okay? Bye. I'll pick you up with my car at 10. Okay. Um... I don't mean to pry, but... Did something happen? Huh? I can tell something happened. If there's anything I can do to help... Then... Yes? Take us out to eat snow crab. Excuse me? - The last ones. - Okay. Getting chummy, aren't they? The section chief likes her. Is that safe? What do you mean? You haven't heard? About what? Oh... Sexual assault? That's the story. But apparently, he was never charged. Hello. He was fired from the company. And our boss hired him. Did Mr. Kimura tell you himself? No... You can be nosy if you want, but don't talk behind his back. But... See you tomorrow. The time in my life when I was most hated. Everybody hated me including myself. When we entered middle school, we grew distant. One day, the first words he said to me in a very long time was... I got it. They impacted my chest literally and figuratively. Your boobs got bigger. He said my boobs got bigger. I couldn't say anything back. I wanted to say, "It's your fault." But I couldn't. Still here? You're gonna turn into boiled snow crab. Trying to be witty? What? Everything's gonna be fine. Hello. Thanks for picking us up. Say hello. Hello. I'm Chinatsu. I'm Kohki. Nice to meet you. Is everyone here? How about a roll call just in case? I admire your resilience against jokes that flop. Shall we? Come on. Let's go. Hey! The traffic was heavier than I thought. Let's go. Remember him from the station? Um... Hideki? Yeah, that's right. Hideki? You have to correct her. It's Kohki. Yep. What? Kohki? - Yeah. - Okay. I can't believe they left us here. We're practically strangers. Even Mr. Kimura went with them. I bet you thought the circus would improve your acting. Falstaff is a clown so you thought you'd see some real-life clowns. I'm so embarrassed. That's exactly what I said to myself. But you didn't learn a thing. You're so perceptive. Am I too transparent? Yeah. I don't have to watch your play. What? You're not coming? I was kidding. I'll go. Give me your number. Okay. Great. Hold this. You ate it. Go ahead. Toko, follow Mr. Kimura's car. Um... I think I'm gonna go home. It's my treat. I broke my term deposit to take you guys out. I was just kidding. I can't tell when you're kidding. You don't have to hire my son. I understand. No, you don't. I... We get it. Listen to me... Yes, I heard. But... I just want to know why you didn't hire him. Why? What's wrong with him? Did he misbehave? It's not going to... You think I'm trying to force you to hire him. You're wrong. I just want to know why you didn't hire him. I get it. I understand. Ms. Muto... You're not doing anything wrong. It's not your fault. Sorry you had to walk. Why are you apologizing? My mom's such a busybody. But she was worried about Ta-bo's mom. When we were kids, we'd hang out at his house and I'd eat dinner there. Me too. Like meat and potatoes without meat. Yeah. She wasn't a good cook. I'll go get something to drink. I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. What if it was Chinatsu? What if it was Kohki? I always think... anything's possible for them. I'm definitely going to die before him. He'll be alone... I have to make sure he's okay. I get it. But kids grow up. Takashi will be fine. You're a great mom. Let me read your novel. Not this one. Maybe the next one. When's that? Don't say 10 years from now. 10 years from now... I wonder what it's like. I have no idea. In middle school, what did I call you? Ko-chan, I think. Why? I couldn't remember. Ko-chan... Ko-chan. What? Nothing. So... what kind of person is she? Tohko. She's kind of interesting. She's... a grown-up who can talk about UFOs like they're no big deal. Yeah... I can see that. Really? She's unapologetic. Yeah. Like... "I'm going to do what I want. Got a problem with that?" Yeah. I totally understand. Your husband passed away? When she was four. Excuse me. What about you? Let's just say I'm too shy around women. I see. Do you cook your meals? A bachelor living alone can survive on fodder. That's no good. You have to eat properly. Or you'll die young. So... if I die alone in my apartment, find me before I rot. At least in the early stages. I'm counting on you. Here. Um... Yes? There's something I need to know. Is it true that you sexually assaulted a woman? I lifted her feet and unbuttoned her shirt. (119 emergency number) Remove all tight clothing. Possible heatstroke. Keep fanning her. Okay. Nomiya... Sorry. That's not sexual assault. You were just an idiot. Yes. But it was construed as sexual assault. I was just following the EMT's instructions. But the woman later reported it to the harassment counselor. It must've been the bra. Yes, in hindsight. Also... I should've asked a female co-worker to take my place. Your earnestness backfired. Lawyers got involved and things got really messy. I turned in my letter of resignation. Why? You should've fought back. Nothing I said changed their minds. I decided to count my losses. I paid a small settlement and it was over. I didn't have to break my term deposit. In any case... I'm relieved. If it was true... I have sweets in the fridge. Would you like some? Thank you. You answered. So what? Are you in a bad mood? No. If you're up for it, will you take me to dinner? That's a crappy way to ask me out. Where's Chinatsu? Did you take her home? Yes. You should've eaten with her. College students are constantly broke. What a pathetic excuse. Fine. I'll go pick you up. Great. Do you know the park near the fishing port? Yeah. I'm home. Sorry about today. Did Ko-chan go home? He had an errand to run. He said don't worry. Thanks. How did you like the circus? It was fun. But no snow crab dinner. You're right. Mr. Kimura. He's a nice guy. He's too good for you. There's nothing going on. You're just like Toko. She says I shouldn't let it pass me by. Mom. I think I'm completely fine. You know... Breast cancer. I'm sure of it. What makes you so sure? I don't know. But I feel really good. The day after tomorrow. The hospital... Let's eat snow crab if the test results are good. The bigger they got, the bigger the distance. The distance between me and him. Each time I tried to close the distance, my heart sizzled and danced... and beat faster. It went into overdrive. There was no room for anything else, but something happened. Something bad. A lump beneath the surface. The lump is still small, around 2 cm. Unlikely to reach the lymph nodes. We'll first figure out the exact type of cancer and the treatment options. Can't you just remove it? You don't have to decide now but you have to start planning. For example, when she plans to have a baby. A baby? But she's still a child herself. Anti-cancer drugs and radiation therapy are two of the options. Certain decisions have to be made before you choose. Um... What about her breast? Have you heard of breast-conserving surgery? A method of keeping as much of the breast shape as possible. So it'll look the same? Yes, but... this procedure is infeasible if the cancer spreads. Also, if we suspect that it won't remove all the cancer cells she may need additional or total mastectomy. I'm sorry... Where did I leave off? Um... I'm gonna visit the city hall before I go to work. Okay. I have to ask about medical insurance. What else? Oh yeah. The bank. Busy, huh? Yeah. It'll cost money. I'm kidding. We'll choose the best treatment. Okay? What's the best treatment? The most reliable one. You don't have to worry about a thing. I'll figure out what's best for you. Sorry I'm late. Sorry I'm late. Sorry I'm late. You had a mild case of anemia. You're fine. You didn't unhook my bra, did you? Of course not. Chinatsu... has breast cancer. Still in the early stage. The doctor told us not to worry. But she can't decide anything on her own so there are a lot of things I have to think about. It's emotionally tough. I wish it happened to me. Should we go eat snow crab? Sorry. I couldn't think of anything else I can do for you right now. (Metastasis to lymph nodes, breast cancer in young women) Sorry I'm late. I'll do anything I can. Thanks. But I just want you to be with me. What did the doctor say? I don't know. Having a baby and things like that. How am I supposed to decide? I've never even had a boyfriend. I don't know what to think. My breast... might get a weird shape. What does your mom say? She wants it removed. Get the best treatment. She's going to decide. I think that's what she means. It feels like she's forcing me to get rid of it. Like... the time she wouldn't buy me a bra. You should talk to her. Okay? Don't make assumptions. Maybe I was too self-conscious about my breasts. Ever since he teased me about them, they've been under so much stress. Maybe that's why the tumor grew. All right. Let's go see this guy and beat him up. Come on. But I doubt Ko-chan remembers. Even now, he doesn't see me as a female. I thought we were getting closer... Toko... Do you think I'll ever fall in love? I had to. I'll have to take time off work. I had to give him a heads-up. I didn't want him to know. I don't have anyone else to talk to. It was kind of a relief to get it off my chest. You just wanna talk to Mr. Kimura. Don't be stupid. He was worried about you. I don't want him to worry. I'd rather have him help us with the medical costs. Don't talk like that. Why are we talking about Mr. Kimura? Because he's important to me. I don't wanna hear it. It makes me sick. He said he'll take us to eat snow crab, but it's up to you. Well... It's not his fault. It's nobody's fault. You don't get it. Hey, Chinatsu. I heard you went to the circus. How was it? I have to work. I wasn't there 'cuz I wasn't hired. You told me a million times. Didn't you have fun? You're lucky in a way. You don't realize you're a moron. I take that back. Sorry. About what? I feel awful. Why? The hospital... The surgery... It's a lot to take in. Are you sick? Ta-bo... Are you sick? If I lose my boobs do I have to give up on love? That's a difficult question. I've never thought about boobs. Your backpack. Don't leave it open. Maybe crab was a bad idea. Nobody's talking. We're too busy eating the crab. We might've stayed silent throughout the meal until we said goodbye. That was funny. Right, Chinatsu? I gave some thought to your situation. I think counting your losses is an option. To accept defeat as gracefully as possible. I'm too busy eating the crab. I don't want to talk about it. It's better to have 9 out of 10 things in life than only 5 out of 10. So, forfeit the one thing. Let it go. Get the surgery... Stop. That's enough. I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I sounded harsh. No. I'm sorry for spoiling the atmosphere. I was never good at reading between the lines. That's a part of your charm. I really appreciate your support. Thank you. You're the one who's helping me all the time. We're both sorry and thankful. In any case, I'm beginning to want my own family. I know this is sudden, but... I realize how I feel. Okay. When I got in trouble at my previous company, there was a woman who always backed me up. But I lost hope in everything and I ran away. I can't tell her how I feel until I get my life back together. So I'm going to start over. Thanks to you, I can be honest about my feelings for her. I'm a bit confused, but I'm glad I was able to help. Right. Good night. Good night. See you tomorrow. Yeah, tomorrow. Do you mind if I step out during lunch? No. Go ahead. Hello. Will you check this purchase order? I have something else to do. Will you ask someone else? Will you calm down? Come here. Let go of me. I don't want to see you again. Tell me why. I just don't want to. Don't tell anyone about me, you hear? Why? Because I could get in trouble for being in a relationship with a minor. Not if we're serious about each other. To me, it was just a fling. Don't you get it? The thing inside me. The biggest and the most troublesome thing. She doesn't understand. She doesn't understand me at all. My breast and heart... will get ripped apart by my mom. I'm sure. He'd mess them up. They'll be invaded by the lump and ripped apart by my mom. Am I going to lose them before anyone touches them? I wonder what it feels like to have my breasts touched. I was cleaning your room. Why are you reading this? I wasn't. The power was on... I know you read it! You were snooping. Chinatsu... I can't stand it. Let's talk. I don't wanna talk to you. I don't wanna see your face. Then what? Don't be silly. Who's keeping secrets? Stop looking for an apartment. It's not about money. You can't live by yourself. Are you gonna move out instead? You want to live with Mr. Kimura. We can't all live here together so you can go live with him... What's wrong with you? You accept and reject me on a whim. I've dedicated my life to you for 18 years. How much longer do I have to? I never asked you to. You can lead your own life! I'm not doing this because you asked me to. What's your point? Nothing! I'm angry at myself for saying this! I don't care anymore... You have to care. You have to think about the future. I can't. It's too late. It's not too late. I won't get married! I won't have kids! I don't care! I'm sick of everything! Chinatsu! Chinatsu! Chinatsu! Your mom called me. She's worried about you. It's none of your business. I'll take you home. No. Come on! Did you bring Ko-chan here? Did you guys have sex in the car? And watch a UFO? You're 30 years old! He's 10 years younger than you! I'm sorry... Chinatsu... I never wanna see you again. Fine. But let me take you home. You and Mom are lucky! You can tell the guy you like how you feel! But I can't! I bet you were laughing at me. I was sulking about your boyfriend. A miserable girl with cancer... If it makes you so upset, grow up. Grow up and talk about your boobs without getting embarrassed. Toko found her. Good... I'm ashamed of myself. I shouldn't have been so condescending to her. The other day... what I said to Chinatsu. I want to take it back. I can't believe I told an 18-year-old to count her losses. I was out of my mind. There was nothing wrong about what you said. I was the one hanging on to her. She's already a grown woman. Ms. Muto... Fight! Yeah... Fight. Tissue paper? No? Excuse me. Tissue paper. No? Excuse me. Tissue paper. And this. Which do you agree with? - There. - Thank you. Bye. See you. Bye. What are you doing? Watching my daughter work. When was the last time we walked together? I don't know. It's been just the two of us for years. I'm bored of it. You're moving out soon anyway, aren't you? When I do, you'll have more time to spend with Mr. Kimura. I remember when I felt giddy. Like a clown at a birthday party. Enough about me. How about you? Any love interest? Of course not. Ick. I don't think I'll ever get married. Or fall in love... You will. I won't. I might lose a breast. It doesn't matter. It might not matter but it might. Okonomiyaki, huh? I'm hungry. Let's eat. Hey... You're heavy. I am not. Stop it. No. Want me to touch your breasts? It feels like this. Knock it off. Did it hurt? It tickled. Again. Stop it. You're embarrassing me. Much bigger now. I'm sorry. You knew it. It happened so fast. For another 10 years... 20 years... No. Longer. Much longer. You have to live. So... That's it? I have to think carefully about my "final answer." Woman to woman, let's talk as many times as we have to. Let's think together. And then you can... choose your own answer. Okay. Hey, Chinatsu! Hi. Hi. Going back? Yeah. Rehearsals are starting. I was dumped. You? Your novel. Oh, that. I finished it. Yeah? Let me read it. No. It's basically a love letter. What? Okay then. I'll see you at school. Yeah. I might... let you read it. Okay. Looking forward to it. Ta-bo! Ta-bo! It's you. It's me. I have a job interview. I might clean up after the circus. The circus is leaving town, huh? Where are you going? University. Classes started. See you around. Wait. Look. I had time during work. (Boobs on the woman you love: necessary 44 / not necessary 54) When you're working... work. See ya. I might work at the circus. Ta-bo. Have you ever touched someone's boobs? Don't underestimate me. Be strong! Be strong! Be strong... Dance, my heart and breast. Beat faster. And sizzle. ©2023 "The Lump In My Heart" Film Partners
