My dear. We accomplished a lot in this world together... Our life's work, the Lord's work. Our message spread just as you imagined. No one could understand me like you did. No one could understand our vision. I am proud of what we did that night, how we made them pay, made them all suffer for their insolent opulence and disrespect for the true Christmas traditions. But what they did to you, how they took you from me. You were pulled away from this world far too early. What a wretched world this has become. But, my love, we are not finished yet. We cannot rest until our work is complete. There is still far more to be done in such a short amount of time. And only we can fulfill that duty together. Greed, wealth, ungiving. You were right about every one of them, riddled with sin. But that one, that one will pay for what she did to you. Don't you worry, my love. Tonight is the night we fix this. Tonight, I bring you back. All right. A little heavier than I remember. Oh. Oh. The hour approaches, Clayton. Hold on a little longer wherever you are. Arise! Arise! No! That spell is correct. This can't be right! Clay? You are home, Clay. You are with me again. Morgan! Yes! Yes! What is this? Why is my voice sound different? Why do I feel strange? I don't know. The spell, it shouldn't have finished just yet. What the fuck! It's... it's in the scripture something of similar mass. I thought it was just started. I didn't know you'd end up being... A fucking tree! Oh, my God. I'm sorry. Why? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just this new body! It's you, you. It's all your fault! I'm going to make you pay for what you've done to us. How to down? I'll be coming. Nothing can stop me! Do you think about them a lot? Yeah. Every day. I just feel so weird not having them around anymore. I took them for granted. So I'd have them with me forever. I could never understand why you had to go through losing them at your age. I know I shouldn't say it, but I'm so glad they killed that guy after what he did. If it was me, I'd want to kill him myself. So you don't think it's bad that I think that? No, not at all. Are we on time love? Actually, a little ahead, my love. Let's take our time on this one. What did these ones do wrong? Same as the others, greedy, lavished with money, and not giving. I'm going to enjoy this. What's that? What do you reckon? You're still doing it. Hm-hmm. Of course. It's better than doing a dull job earning nothing all day. Well, how much are you getting? 2,000 pounds. For one night? Yeah, I don't get why people are so uptight. It's just sex. People do it every day. When do you're like worried? Sometimes if they're weird. But you've just got to look out for the red flags. Like what? My location, my social media, that sort of thing. Hmm. You should give it a go. Me? Um-hmm. No. I don't think so. Well, your clock is ticking. If you ever want to earn any real money, let me know. Um-hmm. Thanks. Hey, is everything OK? Yeah. Yes, OK. I just keep thinking about what happened that night. God, I must be so miserable to be around. No, you are not miserable to be around. Don't be ridiculous. Look, how about we go downstairs, take your mind off things? Yeah. I just need a bit of a break. Yeah. I get you. Everyone downstairs is so jolly, it makes me feel sick. I'll come down. I just need a bit longer. The papers are signed. You're really close to moving out. I think it's going to really help you get rid of all these bad thoughts. Do you still have them every day? Hm-hmm. Yeah. I just can't help it. I honestly don't get why you didn't go to a hotel. It can't be healthy for you staying here. No. You know, I want to just rush off so quick. So many nice memories in this house, more than that one night. I'm just thinking about the good times. It's just really helped me come to terms with what's happened. Yeah, I got you. And if you ever need anything, you can come to me. I mean, unless someone needs me for two grand. Kidding. I'll always be there for you, Faith. I know. Thanks for this last year. No, don't mention it. OK, enough of this mopey stuff. This is a good thing. It's going to be a whole new you. I mean, you can finally get out of the 1600s and maybe develop some tastes. And then who knows. You can go to uni, get yourself boyfriend, all the normal stuff. That's like the last thing on my mind. Yeah, you still got time. I'm going to help you find a new home, Faith. This will always be my home. The memories are in your mind, not in these walls. You can bring them with you anywhere. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Hm-hmm. OK. So because this is your Christmas party and you've been up here for the last hour, how about we get you a drink? You say goodbye to those oldies. And then the real party can start. What's that supposed to mean? I have some special eggnog in the fridge. What is so special about it? You'll have to wait and see. Faith? I can't believe I'm already lost. Morrigan. If only you were still here. I'm so crap at this. I remember each one. But not a single one celebrating the true meaning of Christmas. What's happening in the world, Morrigan? Obsession, my love. Everyone obsessed with gifts and material possessions. Why? Are you questioning what we have done? Of course not. If people do not value their family, they don't deserve to be in one. What is on your mind then, dear? A message isn't spreading, Morrigan. Nobody is paying attention to us. We need to strike fear, become a symbol. Spread a message. Uh-huh. This Christmas will be our best yet. 12 families in a single night. Our message will go global. Oh, whatever you say, my love. We will give the world a night to remember. Hello, mate. You got any money? I don't have time for this, for fuck's sake. Oi! Oi, I'm talking to you! What's that? A fucking tree. For fuck's sake. Oi! Oh get your hands off that! Oi! Go back! You think you can take me? Yeah? Out of my way! Come on in! Come on! All right, I'm going to get you! I've never done that before. Maybe this new body isn't as bad as all that after all. I am coming for you, Faith! Are you ready, my dear? Of course, my love. An hour, perhaps, right? That's my girl. Exactly. And I have the naughty list. Which one first? The Goodwills? Let's show the world what's important. Hello, my dear. I just want to say thank you for inviting us. Oh, well, thanks for coming. It's my pleasure. My parents would be really pleased that you came. You're like a daughter to us. Of course, we'd come. We wouldn't miss it for the world. You grown up into such a lovely girl, Faith. They would really be proud. I know it's been a really difficult year for you, but things will get better now. Good luck with the move. Don't be lifting anything heavy. There's Cindy. Oh, she's done enough already. But why are you leaving so early? It's getting late, and we've got Rupert at home. OK. Well, say hello from me. Yeah, we will do. We had such a good time. We loved your parents very much. Just know if you need anything, we'll do whatever we can. No, you've been kind enough already. You sound just like your dad. No matter what situation he was in, he never asked for help. Don't be like him. If you need help, ask for it. I'm going to miss you guys so much. Well, good luck with everything. The move will be good for you. Thanks. How did your parents know them again? My dad and Gilbert used to go fishing. They'd always come over the house. They're a bit boring. You know, it's just weird. One likely to have seen them again. Well, it's probably for the best. It's better to hang around with weirdos like me, far more entertaining. We need to lighten the mood. This is a party. Hold. So you need the party hat. Um-hmm. And you need to get hammered. One drink. OK? OK. Deal. Come on. I just think it's funny that three of my friends have all said the same thing. I didn't do anything. They're making it up. They just don t like me. How is that my fault? All three of them. Who said it? Who said that? Tell me and I'll go speak to them. I'm not going to tell you so you can act like a bully. I don't know what they're thinking. Maybe they're just like jealous. I find that hard to believe. You think they're jealous because I'm with you? Yeah. All of their boyfriends are losers. Of course, they are. Those are just some big words. Ask them. Ask your little friends. Ask them for some proof. They won't be able to give it to you because it's not true. Probably all lies, huh? Come on, this is me or something. You've known me. Three months, and you've opened up to me once. You don't tell me anything. And sometimes you don't even message me for days. I'm not that hard to understand. Whose side are you on anyway? I'm on any one side. I just want to know the truth. You're supposed to be on my side. That's how relationships work. It's wise to have each other's back. I've known my friends for five years. I wasn't going to drop them for you. So I'm saying, old friends, they fade away. At last, our love his eternal. That's the first time I've heard you talk about love like that. We're made for each other. You have to believe me, baby. I don't know. Fine. Come to me when you've come to your senses. Whatever. There's Faith. You're drinking blackcurrant, huh? No. There's alcohol in here? You are not drinking blackcurrant, on your big night out. Come on. Cindy. No, you're coming with me. It's not blackcurrant. No. You know, you said a glass. Yeah, this is glass. No, you said a glass. Yeah. So I present you a glass. That's a joke. No, it's not. That is bigger than me. One shot within the next hour. Cindy. That is like takes a whole bottle of wine. Just a small bit. Stop. It's just a glass. No, it's just a glass. We had a deal, didn't we? Is that real? Yes, it's mean. She is not staying sober on a big night out. No, you're not. Bottoms up. Come on. You don't have to drink that. Hey, guys, she does. She really does. Cheers. Everyone, to Faith. To faith. To Faith. Good luck. I expect a big gulp now. Just you. Big, big. A bit more. More. Oh, no. Oh, no. That's mental what happened to her. You know, I had no idea her parents were mudered. Yeah, they just... like they were murdered like in this very house. Yeah. You You've got to be in the very spot that they took their last breaths. Dad? Oh, oh, oh. Here's another one! Oh, I'm going to enjoy this one. Come back! Yeah. It was that serial killer that was on the news, like, a year ago. Wait. That happened at this place? Mhm. They killed all those people in one night? Did... Christmas slayers. Yeah. God. That must be horrific to deal with. Yeah. Well, she escaped. She got him, like, executed or convicted. And then... yeah, they said if it wasn't for her, then he would have got away with it. That's pretty bad-ass. Hardly. I mean, look at her. God. She's so mousey. Like... Yeah. I mean... It's probably just by a dumb mark. Yeah. I mean, still she got him caught. Yeah, only the guy. They said that the wife was involved as well. Fuck. Really? Yeah. But the guy just took all the blame. And he said that the wife didn't know anything about any of them. I reckon she's still out to get her? Mhm. Maybe. Like, if she was involved. You know, but the police have put a tag on her. You know, to keep an eye on her. So... I'll be fine. I guess. I think that's why she selling the house anyway. You know? Yeah. It's a. I guess... No, shh. There she goes right over there. She's got. No. Paul, shh. Can we just leave? Because I really don't want to talk to her. Like, I can't deal with her negative attitude. Where do you want to go? Well, there's a pool outside. Do you want to see a cannonball? Yeah? OK. Come on. Can't believe I lost that map. She's taking ages. Ah, a car. OK, settle down, Clay. Play it cool. Is that a tree? Do you think one of Faith's friends could have left it there? Did she just say "Faith"? Why would they do that? Someone probably just dumped it there. Come back, Gilbert. Something doesn't seem right. Let's go. Hang on a sec. This won't take long. Well done! I'm so proud of you. Thank you. Are you doing OK? You all right? Yes. Suppose I needed a bit of a break. And we tried to stop Cindy, but you know what she's like. As soon as she realized you went down, she ran upstairs. You OK there? Yeah. Me and Tina got into an argument again. I think she's hiding something. Just gets so defensive over nothing. She's always hiding her phone. What should I tell you? I know what I saw. We need to got rid of her. Yeah. I can smell a dickhead from a mile away. And she is one of them. I know. I just normally really like her. I hope she's not messing me around. Oh my god. Is that that guy? Oh... Yep. It is. She like texted me and went upstairs. No. The girls don't say anything. Here we go. Don't say anything. Ready? Hi, baby. How are you? Hey, babe. What are you doing? Oh, I'm just out with the girls. We're having a great time. But I miss you. Take your dress off. Oh... oh, you're breaking up. No. Oh my god. Oh my god. I can't believe he just said that. Oh my god. Maybe that was Tina. Ooh. Not funny. You know, Faith said she's going to do this. Uh, what? No. Mhm. Yeah. She was just saying that she'll do anything to get minted. Stop. Oh. I can't believe you. I did not say that. I'm joking. Awesome party, by the way, Faith. Loving the festive vibes. Thanks. Well, that's all thanks to Becky. She did the decorations. It took ages. Have you seen the size of this place? Yeah. Yeah. If I lived here, I'd just leave them up all year round. Hey, drink up. All right. Mhm. Cool. And we're on the same team. Oh, has she gone missing again? You need to put a cowbell around that girl's neck. Seriously. He needs put a rein on her. Yeah. I've developed a really good creep detector. She's a creep. She's not a creep. Babe, we're just trying to look out for you. , Faith. Me? Mhm. Oh, I don't know. You know, I barely know the girl. So... She's got to not sit on the fence. I can't. You know, Lou, once she's finished this, she's going to tell you the truth. I'm going to go find Tina. No. That girl looks like a lost puppy. I'll give it two months and she's going to be in tears. Maybe she should break up with her or she's going to get hurt. Right. Anyway, girls, I'll be right back. I've got something to show you later. Ah. We'll miss you. You'll see. How's that? All right. What's cracking? You sure know how to make an entrance. You like? Yeah. Yeah. It suits you well. What doesn't? I've got something to tell you. Oh. What? Yeah. It's exciting. Do you want to go for a walk outside and I'll fill you in? Oh. Why do we have to go outside? Well, come on and you'll find out. Nah. I don't really fancy a walk. Trust me. You'll want to hear this. Why can't you just tell me now? No. You look like you need the fresh air. And we haven't caught up, just us two, in ages. Come on. Fine. Yeah, I'm just sick of lawyers and estate agents and reporters. Because they're still trying to get me to talk. You know, I just don't want to keep reliving it. I know. I don't envy you. But honestly, everything's over now and you can start afresh in a new place. And all these reporters will disappear. Yeah. I doubt that. No. Listen to me. You're a lot stronger than me. Everything's going to be fine. You're stronger than you think, Becky. Look at what you're wearing. I mean, I wouldn't be caught dead in that. You know what I mean. Yeah. Thanks. I just want to apologize. For what? I just feel like it's been a really chaotic year for me as well. And I just really haven't been there for you. You don't need to apologize. No. Honestly, I do. Well, what happened? Oh god. Where do I start? School was hectic. So much has happened. Gary got committed. Committed? Yeah. He had a breakdown during exams. Something to do with stress. Oh god. Poor guy. He did seem a bit unhinged, though. Yeah. I don't think he's ever going to be the same again. So, um, was that the news? No. God no. I just thought you'd be interested because remember he tried to hit on you like two years ago. God. Yeah, I forgot about that. Wasn't that memorable, was he? No, no. I remember just fine. It's just things and school has just become a bit of a blur. I'm going to miss you. I'm not disappearing, Becky. I know. I hope not. Still my mate in it? How have you lasted this long? Having mates like you, lot. All right, I know people ask you to be kind to people after this stuff happens. But you know what? Like, I can't. Yeah. You'd be too if your whole family was murdered. I don't know. I think I'd be all right after a few weeks. But that's normal. Christ. That's dark. You know, she just needs help is all. She just goes on and on and on about it. What do you have against her, anyway? Uh, are you defending her? No. Just curious. Nothing. She's just milking it for attention. Isn't she? You're jealous. Me? Yeah. Not of her. Mhm. Are you serious? No. Obviously... Yeah, but you do like attention, though. Yeah. I know I do. Obviously. Obviously. But I won't go on and on about it. Just get over it. Won't I? Ah. Fuck, it's freezing. I know. It's so much better being out here than in there, though. Yeah. Is that better? Yeah. A bit. Is that better? That's much better. Oh no. No. Come on. What? You know what. Please. It's important. Oh, can't you just tell me? Please. I don't want to do this tonight. It'll be so good. After every ball you hit back, I'll give you a clue. Oh, this is stupid, Becky. Oh, it'll be fun. Come on. It'll be like the old days. Don't you remember? Yeah, yeah. I remember. But we're too old for this now. Oh, we're never too old to have fun. God, this is ridiculous. You... you look ridiculous. OK? Mhm. Hold on. I cannot believe I let you talk me into doing these things. No peeking. OK? Can you see? No. All right. Remember, hand goes... yeah? Mhm. All right. I'll be back. OK. You ready? Yep. What's that? I don't know. What the fuck? Yeah, take this. I got. Stop. You want... you want to come out? You want to come out? Come on. Ah. You bitch. Yes! Yes! Take this! Oh, come here, you terrible bitch. I'm gonna rip you up. I'm gonna rip you up. Yes! Oh no. I've got you trapped. Yes. No! No! Yes. Wait! Yeah! I. I've got you trapped now. I've got you tr... I'm going to have you. Please. Help me! I'm going to enjoy it. I'm going to enjoy you with.. You deserve it! Yes! Are you ready? I'm going to enjoy this. All right. You ready? Yeah. Ball number 1. To your left! Ooh. Come on. Put more effort into it. All right. I'm trying. Coming up, ball number 2. Ooh. Yes! OK. Your first clue is... No! Get off! Please! Becky! No! Oh my god. Hey, what's happening? Why do you look stressed? There's something... Calm down. Calm down. Oh my god. He's back. Just calm down. This is something... he's back. Clay Slater is. No. It's true. OK? Who's back? Who's back? Clay Slater. We need to call the police. OK? He's controlling some weird Christmas tree. Faith, look at me. Look at me. OK. OK, he's dead. No, no... He's dead. No. This is all in your head, Faith. He's back, OK? I heard him. I did. I know what I saw. All right? And he's coming. Are you sure it wasn't that lady? Yes, I'm sure, Ken. We need to lock the doors, please. No, no. Probably just Alex in a new.. Yeah. Oh my god. Are you not listening to me? I just saw Becky get killed! OK? I saw it. I saw it. I'm sure, Ken. We need to lock the doors right now. No, please. You cannot let them leave. No. Shh. It's not safe out there. OK, thank you. No, no, no. You cannot go. It's not safe out there. OK? Please, just stay. Please don't go. No! You cannot let them leave. Thanks so much, Faith. All the best. It's OK. Look, we'll go check it out. And you stay here. OK? Wait, what... It's OK. You're not listening to me. It's OK. It's OK. We'll check it. I'm not joking. OK? Please... What the fuck is that? I can't watch. Oh my god. Where have you been? In the toilet. What the hell is that? Oh my god. What are we going to do? I don't know. We have to get out of here. No. Where are you going? Well I'm not staying here. You can't be walking around out there. We'll go out the garden and we'll jump the fence. Come on. What do we do now? We've got to call the police. No. No. It won't matter. It didn't last time. We're in the middle of nowhere, OK? He'll be inside the house within seconds. Then what do we do? We need to hide? OK? And hope that he thinks that we made a run for it. Mhm. That is a dumb idea. That is the only option that we have. No. I'm making a run for it. No, Tina. Wait, please. I'm going. Babe, come with me. I'm staying. Babe, I'm going. Are you coming with me? Fucking typical. Tina... No. If you're going to be stupid, then I'm not going to protect you anymore. Go back for your girls. Like you always do. Suit yourself. Stop! Ugh! God! It's probably best that she's gone. How could you even say that? Because she's probably going to get us caught. She doesn't give a shit about you. But she's now on her own. She doesn't give a shit about you! Why do you... We left her! She cheated on you! Why do you give a shit? Just stop arguing. All right? Listen, we need to hide. All right? Now, come on. Come on. No. You guys go upstairs. I'm going to find something to stop him. How are you going to stop that? I don't know. But we can't just hide. Louise, come on. You can't... No, come on. Faith, we have to get to safety. Come on. Faith, we need to get to safety. Come on. Come on. Oh my god. Faith, what the hell? He's going... he's coming for me. He's coming for me! OK, OK. I need you to stay with me. Calm down. OK? Shit. He's still out there. No. He's coming in. He's going into the bedroom. No. No, no, no. Yep, yep. Come on. I've got you, Faith. Come on. Trust me. Yep. Under the bed. It's OK. You're good. You're good. Surprise. Ah! It went right through me! Louise must have found my dad's shotgun. I'm bulletproof, too. Come here, bitch! Ah! Up. Yeah. Ah. You thought you'd got me, didn't you? Look at you now. You don't look so smart. You thought you'd got me, didn't you? You look so smart now, you witless bint. Morgan? Is that you? Morgan? Is that you? Oh. Morgan. Morgan. Oh! Ah! Of course not! Oh! Of course not. Holy night. All is calm... ...all is bright. Round yon virgin, mother and child. Holy infant so tender and mild. Sleep in heavenly peace. Sleep in heavenly peace. Silent night. Holy night. Shepherds quake at the sight. Glory streams from heaven afar. Heavenly hosts sing "Hallelujah." Christ the savior is born. Christ the savior is born. Silent night. Holy night. Son of God, love's pure light. Radiant beams from thy holy face with the dawn of redeeming grace. Jesus Lord at thy birth. Jesus Lord... Come out from wherever you are. I know you're in here. Oh, fuck's sake. Fuck's sake. Oh, come out. Come out from wherever you are. I know you're in here. Do you realize what we did to your mom in this very room? Oh, I'm going to find you, Faith, and make you pay for what you did to me, and for what you did to Morgan. They're still in the house. Hm. And I bet you, yes, you will not escape me. I'm going to rip you up. I think it's him. Leave her alone! Leave her alone! Please help me. I'm so sorry. I'm going to find you, Faith. Oh where, oh where could you be? You'll pay for what you did to me. And... to Morgan. I'm going to find you. So you might as well show yourself. Yes. Where are you? Come, show yourself you horrible girl. I will find you wherever. Where are you, you horrible girl? Show yourself now. You think the darkness of the woods is your ally? You have only adopted it. I was born in the woods, molded from this very soil. Ooh! I've got you, Faith. Got you now, Faith. It's time for you to pay for what you did to us. Yes, you thought you'd get away, but you can't get away. I've tied you up now. You can't get out of this. You will try. You will struggle. And you won't know. I've got you. I've got you finally. I didn't do anything. Yes, you did. If you were just tied up like me, and Morgan would be alive today. You are such a selfish girl. You're a murderer! You killed... Silence! Listen. Listen. Listen. You're all mine now, Faith. I've thought about killing you for a very long time. But I never imagined I would have this body. So many possibilities. Do I saw of your limbs with my branches? Do I stuff you full of tinsel? Or do I shove candy canes up your nose? Or do I have some fun beforehand? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. You bitch. You can't get away. You can't get away! Who the fuck are you? Don't you recognize us? "Us"? It is inevitable that we'd find you. We are the ones that stay tethered to this world because of the link you left behind. Your Faith's parents? Mom? Dad? Do not worry, Faith. Everything is fine. He can't hurt you anymore. He's trying to kill me. Get inside, Faith. We are here to protect you. But you don't have enough strength. We are as strong as you. We are the good to your evil. The yin to your yang. The light to your darkness. What a load of rubbish. You're not strong enough. Take this. Take this! Oh. Lucky shot. What a cheap shot. Two of you, and you're still this weak? Our fates are shared. I'm so sorry. So sorry. I've missed you so much. Thank you for saving me. Mom, Dad, wait. Girl, we've been looking for you for hours. What's wrong? Where did they go? Where did who go? Clay was here. Clay? Clay. Clay was here. They killed him. Before he caught you, Cindy, did he... Faith, Clay's dead. No. Yeah. Faith, I'm OK. I'm OK. Look. Look at me. I'm fine. We were all looking for you. You were gone for hours. We're all OK. No... no. No. Faith, do you remember what happened at your parents' funeral? Do you remember that? I think this is Let's get you a warm cup of coffee, a warm bath, and you'll feel a lot better. All right? Come on. It's going to be OK. OK. So girls, when you thought about the way that you would die, did you ever think it would be a killer Christmas tree? No. We should keep that to ourselves. Yeah? Yeah. I that's proper. Have a final look, girls. Come on, then. Let's get you a new home. I'm so done with this place. Come on. Let's go. Thanks, Mom. Thanks, Dad.
