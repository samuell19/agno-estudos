WWII unleashed Nazi Germany, involved in its the orbit of more than 60 states with population of 1.7 billion people. 4/5 of humanity. All Central Europe turned out to be under the misfortune of German fascism. German troops irresistibly rushed to the east. Red army seeing bloody defensive battles, retreated to Moscow. Here the enemy was stopped and discarded. The year 1942 has come. The warring parties were preparing for a decisive summer campaign. Mr. Lieutenant I recorded someone else's transmitter. The transfer was from Berlin. It cannot be. In Berlin, someone else's transmitter! You messed up something. I also recorded the beta X callsigns. Mr. Reichsführer, I must inform you. Radio interception service found enemy lines in our rear shortwave radio station. These pianists ... What other pianists? So they are called the counterintelligence service. These pianists work in Berlin, Amsterdam and Geneva. What is reported in intercepted telegrams? Mr. Reichsführer, telegram radio unfortunately for now cannot be decrypted. I order you to catch the pianists immediately! You probably already know Bock? What did I take command of the ground forces? And I called you to appoint the commander of the Army Group South. But I could not take to Moscow, my Fuhrer. We will not recall the past. Tips will be next summer defeated. I mean while in the center front no longer conduct offensive operations. My goal will be offensive on the southern front. I decided to concentrate all the main forces and take a strike in the direction of the Caucasus. This is the most important area. Need to go to the Caucasian oil. Haver, report the plan of Operation Blau. My Fuhrer, the basis of the operation plan. "Blau" - rapid turn of large tank forces from Voronezh to the south. The tanks have to move at maximum speeds along. Don, then to Stalingrad. And connecting with the Kharkov group, tread on the Caucasus. At the same time, an imitation of the attack on Moscow is being conducted. It will be a camouflage operation called the Kremlin. Using all methods of misinformation. As long as the Russian command understands that the strike was not delivered to Moscow, but to the south, all tasks on surrounding and eliminating the southern group Soviet troops will be executed. When you can do it a path to the Caucasus will open before us. And then in front of us is India. The main thing, move south faster. And at the same time to forge Russian reserves at Moscow. In no case do not touch the 70 divisions that are in center. - But, my Fuhrer ... Take troops before Operation Blau wherever you want. All of our allies. 70 divisions in the center should all the time hang like a sword of Damocles over Moscow. Allow to apply. Oberleutenant Schulzeboisen, Harro, if you remember. Well then Harro, I haven't seen you in a long time. And how is your father, my dear Erich? Father is now participating in the blockade of England. In his letters, he always asks to convey greetings to you. Thank you Mr. Field Marshal were you now at the Fuhrer and received new appointments? Yes, I have been appointed commander of the Army Group South. Congratulations, Mr. Field Marshal. I have a personal request for you: I serve at the air force headquarters and I want to transfer to the army in order to participate in the offensive. But Reich Marshal Bering doesn’t let me go, he says that the order to deploy troops will not be soon. Hurry up my friend you need to be in time no later than May. Good luck! Thank you Mr. Field Marshal! What is there? Can not hear anything. It's too early. Anxiety! Turn off the radio. What happened? Look - a raid. Give me the transmitter. And bring the best suitcase. You can’t transfer more from Berlin. Last time. It is very important. This night, Harro Schulzeboisen transferred to the center. To the director: Troop deployment for offensive in the Caucasus will happen by May 1 1942 year. According to intelligence information from Germany, large forces of Nazi troops focus in the southern section Soviet-German front. Not every intelligence data can be trusted. Report better how the General Staff regards our plans for the summer of 42 years? As for our plans 42 years for spring and summer, the General Staff believes that we still do not have enough forces and means, to expand major offensive operations. In the near future should be limited active strategic defense. But do not sit on the defensive and wait for the Germans to strike first? Excuse me, comrade Stalin? Southwest troops entrusted to me now able to inflict on the Germans preemptive strike. It's about a major offensive operation with the release of our troops on Gomel-Kiev line. Oh you! Look where you swung! And what does Zhukov think? I believe that at present we cannot carry out a major offensive operation. This requires reserves, which you hold, comrade Stalin. Reserves are needed for the defense of Moscow! Sit down. And a larger group German troops. 70 divisions! Located in the Moscow direction. It gives us the right to believe that with the onset of summer the enemy will try to inflict crushing blow It is in the central direction. Agent messages from Germany smell of disinformation. I support the opinion. Boris Mikhailovich Shaposhnikov about active strategic defense, but along with this one needs to draw a number offensive operations. We must agree with the proposal Tymoshenko and strike at the Kharkov group the enemy. Thank you for your trust, Comrade Stalin. Conduct the operation in cash. And keep in mind: You will not receive reserves! Coming to Kharkov without additional reserves is a doomed business. Why not you nor did Shaposhnikov tell him about this? Useless business. Did you see his face? And from intelligence messages from Germany too quickly dismissed. May 12, 1942 troops of the southwestern front went on the offensive. They broke through the enemy's defenses and advanced to 50 km in the direction of Kharkov. May 17, in 11 divisions of Field Marshal von Bock flanked the attacking forces southwestern front. Comrade Stalin, the situation on the southwestern front is critical. Urgent need to stop attack on Kharkov. I talked to the marshal. Tymoshenko. He considers, that the offensive must continue. Comrade Stalin, I again ask you to stop the offensive. There was a threat to the environment. Connect me with. Khrushchev. Hello, comrade Stalin. There are serious concerns. And should the operation be stopped? Comrade Stalin, measures taken by the command, will be sufficient to reflect hit from the flank. But because, I think, there is no reason to stop the operation. Continue the offensive. Khrushchev! I am a lily of the valley! I am a lily of the valley! Please allow the departure. Please allow the departure! I turn to the reception. They are silent, scum! Wait! Wait! What's going on here? Yes, we shoot cowards. The Germans left machine guns. Don't kill us. We will redeem. I redeem. Untie their hands. You have no right! I am the head of a special department. And I am a member of the military council of the front. I need soldiers for World War II. Shoot a little! Get on the tank! Please note, I will complain. On the table. Why on the table? Your bone is sticking out. And around inflamed. If I regret your foot - you will die of gas gangrene. I’ll shoot you all to mother’s unit! Send me to Moscow immediately! How dare you! What's your last name? Khrushchev. Senior Lieutenant Khrushchev. I order to send me immediately to Moscow. Serious defeat of Russian troops in the rayon of Kharkov dramatically changed the balance of power on the entire southern wing of the eastern front. Events are developing in full compliance with the general plan of the supreme command. We are close to our main task. The implementation of the general offensive Operation Blau. For the main operation 99 divisions of 1260 tanks are involved and more than 1,600 combat aircraft. Our tank wedges crash into the location of the enemy, like a hot knife into a piece of butter. But Russians should not know anything. Operational orders to transmit only orally. For violations - the death penalty. Gestapo and Abwehr head responsible for maintaining secrecy. Before the operation "Blau" the rear must be cleaned from enemy spies. Direction finding service detected transmitters in Prague, Zurich, Bruges, Amsterdam, Brussels. In search of radio stations used intelligence aircraft. They flew over cities equipped with direction finders. So far, unfortunately, without results. Attract the best forensic experts in Germany. In Brussels, Bruges, Amsterdam keep your people in every police station. Check all residents of these cities. Act, Gidding, act, immediately! After a mysterious chapel brought pure coincidence. Happening. Which was previously explained divine providence. Can I speak with the police commissioner? He's not in now. What happened to you? You see, I'm Karl Lawns. The businessman. I live on the street of Atreboty, house 101. Two French women live in a neighboring apartment. And you understand we began to notice that these girls men often visit. My wife said bluntly: Maybe at our side stash of debauchery? What, these girls bother you so much? We are devout Catholics and we cannot put up with immoral acts. Somewhere in the raion of the boulevard transmitter. We need to seize the opportunity and to inspect this house. You said: 101 Atrebota Street? - So exactly. Good. We will check what your French women Stay here. Who you are? I am Sophie Poznanska, French. From Bordeaux. On what basis did you break into our apartment at night? Documents! What are you French? You can’t connect two words. Who are you? Can you speak German? Well, do not want to answer questions - we'll talk tomorrow. Documents! I do not know anything. I just performed the duties of a housewife - cooked and washed floors. I don’t know anything, honestly! Bring Poznansk to me. What is the name of the radio operator? I do not know his last name. He came sometimes stayed overnight and then sat at the transmitter until morning. Do you know anything more about him? Nothing. Mr. Hauptsturmführer, arrested by Sophie Poznanska, committed suicide. What? I opened the veins with a splinter of glass. She knew too much and preferred death. Decrypted the radiogram of the radio operator? Not. But among the columns of numbers There are two unencrypted radiograms. They set out some kind of plan. "Blau" - an operation to seize Stalingrad and the Caucasus. What? It can't be! This is a catastrophe! Enemy penetrated the most secret secrets of high command. How to report to the Fuhrer now? What does Abwehr do? Imperial security. Where is the counterintelligence? If the tribunals are not able to fight betrayal, I I will find a remedy. I won’t tolerate being hindered victoriously end the war with the Bolsheviks! In future about the actions of the enemy in our rear to report to me personally. Postpone the operation of Blau. Bok, think about disguising the operation. But the whole summer’s plan campaigns cannot be changed! Main strike to prepare no later than the end of June. You fly short way across the front line. Our aviation in this sector has a complete advantage in the air. But there may be anti-aircraft batteries. The Russians do not shoot well, Major. No hesitation, Reichel. Major Reichel's portfolio was lying false intelligence prepared by German intelligence the beginning of the offensive on June 22, 1942. Battery, fire! Pilots, seize pilots! Faster, Faster! Wait! Intercepted enemy documents no doubt. Airplane apparently lost orientation fell into the scope of our anti-aircraft artillery and was shot down. An officer with the rank of major tried to hide. But he was killed in a shootout. In our estimation, the enemy’s plan is as follows: The enemy seeks to defeat to our flank armies. We know your assessment of the situation. Your and comrade Khrushchev, leading to a serious error. If we told the country about that disaster with the loss of 20 divisions, that the southwestern front survived, then you would be very cool. I warn you about liability. June 22, 1942 exactly according to the term of the captured order, German Army Group South start an attack on its right flank. My Fuehrer, day and night, not fading, there are heavy fighting. Heavy fights? It's good. So the disguise worked. The Russians were waiting for our offensive and pulled up reserves here. Now gentlemen the time comes for Operation Blau. We will start her June 28th. June 28, 1942 Wehrmacht inflicted its main strike on the left flank of the southern front. The one in deep secret prepared, the Blau plan. In the battle, both sides acted over 2 million soldiers. More than 2 thousand tanks. 2 thousand aircraft. Soviet troops with heavy battles retreated to Stalingrad. Ah, Kuzma! Are you here? I came to my previous position. Member of the military council southwestern front. The southwestern front is disbanded. Instead, Stalingrad was created. I am appointed a member of the military council. Instead of you. There probably played that you were surrounded. Yes, I was surrounded. And withdrew many troops. And you know it! And the environment, by the way, it might not be. If you correctly assessed the situation, and then hit the hornet’s nest right! Everyone was waiting for the German blow to Moscow, and he deceived us again! What time is it already! “How dare you say that?” You're a commissioner! The Supreme takes all decisions. Do not you discuss them. The Germans took it. Lower Chirk. Did they take the Church Church? How will we report? I will plunge. Come on. HF comrade Stalin. Hello, comrade Stalin. The situation is difficult, comrade Stalin. The enemy continues to develop the offensive with superior forces. However, the main goal of the enemy is surround and destroy troops of the front west of the Don, not reached. Our troops are moving along the lines. What milestones? Are you snoring? Give the territory? And the population? And try it pass off as high military art? Where is Tymoshenko? Tymoshenko? He is swimming. Where? - In a river. Pass on Tymoshenko that he is suspended from command of the Stalingrad Front. The order we must take today what number, comrade Shcherbakov? 227, comrade Stalin. Write. Enemy throws to the front all new forces and, regardless of losses, creeps forward. And some stupid people on front console themselves with talk about that we can continue to retreat east. The territory of the Soviet state - it is not a desert. Retreat further - means ruining our homeland. I have to write. All army commanders, corps and division commanders, admitted unauthorized withdrawal of troops, will be put on trial by a military tribunal! Lead detachments from the troops. NKVD with machine guns. All fleeing the battlefield alarmists and cowards must be shot on the spot. Presidium of the Supreme Council of the SSR for courage and bravery shown in battles at the front of World War II, awards the order. Red banner captain. Ruben Ruiz Ibarrudi. Captain Ruben Ruiz Ibarruri is Spanish. The son of the general Secretary of the Communist Party of Spain. Dolores Ibarruri. We also invited him today to she was present while rewarding his brave son internationalist, who fights for Soviet freedom people. I ask you. I congratulate you on your hero son. But we will live! For a life! Sorry if this is not a military secret. Are you an infantryman? Yes, because an infantryman - this is the most masculine of all professions. It’s not for nothing that they say that infantry - infantry - is the queen of the fields. Aviation - Queen of the Sky, Artillery - god of War. The generals came up with all these comparisons. So to speak, create romance. But in fact, all this cannon fodder. What gloomy jokes, Lenya? What are you Do you want to ruin the whole mood? Yes? Do you want me to sing a song? Good one. Spanish! The real one? Spanish? We sang it in our village. Watch how it walks. And they wanted to tickle! Surgeons are very fond of this. How did you convince them? I had an argument. Here he is. The most important. Well, show me. Scouts presented. Walter. He will kill a fly from 30 meters. So. Come on, let's shoot. Never fired from Walter. And what? Let's go baw! Let's go to! Look. Sniper shot. Like this. Shoot me. I need courage. I'm going to the front. No, guys. Are you scared? Shoot, don’t be afraid. Well, how small are you? And I'm not afraid. Boys, what are you doing? It was an accident, Comrade Stalin. For youth and stupidity. Punishment, of course, should be but still it’s Khrushchev’s son, member of the military council of Stalingrad front. Give to the military tribunal. Maybe postpone the sentence until the end of the battle of Stalingrad? Colonel General Eremenko arrived. Let him come in. I beg. Wait a minute. Leave your wand. And come on in. Colonel General Eremenko arrived at your order. So you think you got better? So sure, healed. So-so. And when he walks, he limps. Please do not worry, everything is in order with me. The bones have grown together perfectly. Well, we assume that Comrade Eremenko returned to duty. Let's get down to business. They say the first imperialist You stabbed the war in a bayonet attack 22 person? 22 enemy soldiers, Comrade Stalin. And the hand did not flinch? No, comrade Stalin. It's good. Cruelty. - the right quality. For the front commander. Near Stalingrad difficult situation. Urgent action needed to strengthen this responsible section of the front. We want to entrust this to you. How do you look at it? Ready to serve wherever consider it necessary to send. You are wasting time. Go to the General Staff read the situation on the Stalingrad front and ... Calculate your work like this to fly to Stalingrad tomorrow. I obey! Let me go? Go ahead. Take your wand. And about the son of Khrushchev - let him demoted to the rank and file and will be sent to the front. I obey. Well, I'm on the bus. If he still walks. Are you going to call your father? Not. You are not foolish. He will be glad to see you. Until I return the senior lieutenant - I will not go. And don't tell me about it. Okay. Let's go for a minute, say goodbye. Come on, don’t think. Let's go. Allow me to sit down for 5 minutes. Just don’t order anything - I have everything. For our witnesses! Witnesses of what? Our marriage. We just decided to get married. Here, get acquainted, Vera, she is ... My fiancee. Very nice. And my name is Vasya. Now let's drink - right to the registry office. I, you see, I don’t have relatives, So I decided to help Vera.

And it didn’t occur to us make some girls happy. Well, for your future. Wait you! Vera. Verka! She didn’t tell us anything.

Now no need monetary certificate. I'm so happy! Well, I will also say goodbye. Stay alive, Ruben. August 12, 1942 flew to Moscow Prime Minister. Great Britain. Winston Churchill. Soviet command made a plan for its summer operations counting on the opening of a second front in Europe in 1942. But the failure of the UK government from creating a second front in Europe, greatly complicated the situation of the Red Army. We believe, what are the most favorable conditions now to open a second front. Nearly all the forces of the German troops, and while the best forces are distracted to the eastern front. And in Europe, there was a negligible part of the German troops. Moreover, the worst. We are handing you a memorandum about this question. I will answer to this memorandum in writing. And about the German forces in. Europe then they are enough to repel Allied troops landing. This is a big risk. Head who thinks about losses all the time, can't win the war. The british army is not must be so afraid of the Germans. I am indignant at this accusation and I can forgive him just because I admire the heroic struggle of the Red Army. As for the problem second front in Europe, then preparation for implementation major landing operations in northern France in 1943 will continue. It’s not what words he said Prime Minister, but in what he demonstrated us our determination and. Fighting spirit. What's his name? Personal bodyguard of the British Prime Minister Commander Thompson. Head of Comrade Stalin’s security. Translate. Comrade Stalin’s life is very dear, and we cherish it like the apple of an eye. How to translate the apple of an eye? In a word, say that comrade Stalin - our brilliant leader is a teacher. Under the conditions of the machinations of German fascism, all kinds of actions of enemies of the people are possible. Until the assassination attempt. Therefore on our part need constant vigilance. To me as a personal bodyguard Mr. Churchill also have to exercise special vigilance. Hard work. Especially, try brandy all day. History shows that many statesmen were poisoned by alcohol. But despite this, mister. Churchill intensively consumes it. I frankly admit I can’t stand the cognac. We also have to try everything. Comrade Stalin drinks first then different Georgian wines, here and the head is stunned. How to translate "stunned"? How can you? Well, a person becomes an idiot. Go ahead. All these wines are on the table of a comrade. Stalin. Is all this to be tried? Everyone, we don’t know what they will drink. Let's work, Tommy. What does Mr. Stalin think about the possibility of meeting between him and president of the united states? It could take place somehow in the winter. As for the venue, then it could be carried out, for example, in Iceland. In Reykjavik. I suggest a drink for the president’s health. Roosevelt What happened here? You know, Your Excellency, Tommy can have a drink a lot of wine and never gets drunk. For this I appreciate him. But, this time he overestimated their capabilities, competing with Russian colleagues. August 19 German shock groups forced Don and created a bridgehead on his east coast for offensive on. Stalingrad. Commander of the 62nd Army, General Lopatin, trying to drive the German troops off the bridgehead, threw a counterattack of the 35th Guards Rifle the division. Forward! Follow me! Damn cowards! On the stomachs, calluses will be grated. Anu, stop chilling! Get up! Forward! What is wrong with you, Comrade Captain? Heals before the wedding. Tanks! The tanks passed by. I repeat 100 German tanks passed us. Go to Stalingrad. Until the war ends no hope of getting married. Lucky for you, Verka. You still have a husband. Husband. Overeating pears. Fool! She didn't even him tried what kind of husband he is. The receipt is one in the passport. And for me he still the best man. My husband, Vasya. Girls, get ready for the bath. Girls, name is! Wait! Halt. Halt! Maybe we won’t wake up? We are going to look for bosses. Captain Ibarruri. Combat of the 35th guard. Commander 1077 anti-aircraft artillery regiment Lieutenant Colonel German. You know, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel, that the Germans managed to cross over. Don? And after a few hours they may be here. Not. No artillery headquarters. Have you seen refugees? Well, I think we don’t have to panic. I have a girl in the regiment. Where is your emergency deployment point? We must move to the northern outskirts. Stalingrad. Cover the tractor factory. We must immediately raise the regiment. I will rush them through the sentries. Signora! Signora, after all, there is the Great Patriotic War war. Well, well, get away from military equipment! Come away! What does emancipation only do! We are not men - we are commanders. Anxiety! Get dressed immediately! We cannot, we are wet. It’s dripping from us! And you turn away. Get up! Get in line immediately. Outsiders are here! Sorry Comrade Captain. We are not combed. Hello brides! Girls! Everyone needs to be fast collect. Try to be brave. Ahead of the battle. Have questions? Comrade Lieutenant Colonel let go into battle in civil slippers. We were given shoes of 41 sizes. They say there are no others. And my friends and I wear 33. Almost 10 sizes smaller. Look here. Okay. Go to the battle in shoes. Hooray! Nikita Sergeevich? Do you know the situation at the front? German tanks in one and a half kilometers from the city. It can't be! I just saw German tanks from the window! Do whatever it takes to to detain the Germans before the approach of our troops. I wish you good health, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel. Hello Ruben. Managed to turn around? We also turned around. You know what, let's have a smoke. The girls and I will not leave our positions. And we will not back down either! Russian infantry is to death. Allow me to say goodbye in Russian? Comrade Captain The commander of the 12th detachment is Senior Lieutenant Savkin. I want to inform you that I I occupy those heights. Why there, in the rear? Immediately in the first line! I have no right. According to order number 227, I must not allow your retreat. In all the departing I will shoot from machine guns. So, for now - get out of here. Out! Direct guns on tanks! Girls! Girls, you have to! Well be afraid - do not be afraid, it is necessary! Well! Well, charge! Nadia, charge! To the gun! Get ready for battle, girls! Come on, dear! Gun! Fire! How many tanks have gathered today? 28. And 32 is at the training center. True, considering those that are not on the go. Those not on the go can be used. Tow and use as fire points. - Good. Drivers, I think you have? Type. And you, fathers, are too late to fight. Go to jobs. How late is it? Why is it too late? It's never too late to fight, especially when Fritz grabbed by the throat. Rifles would be for us, then if you had seen. Late or not late. I defended Tsaritsyn from the White Guards. So please write me down to the fighter battalion. And I fought in the Baltic. And with the Germans. How old are you? Well, what years to take? We are still head start for you give such. Girls, you are future mothers. I want you to save your life. Go to the Volga. There are boats. Comrade Lieutenant Colonel! Do not! I order! Go! Let's go. Closer. Let it get closer. Comrade Captain! Comrade Captain, hold on! We will cut off the infantry from the tank. “But you are shooting?” Only in your own way! Yours will not run. Three days and three nights armed militia workers, anti-aircraft gunners and sailors fought with the enemy breaking through to Stalingrad and stopped him on the northern outskirts of the city. Thanks, Captain Ibarruri. You defended Stalingrad. Write to my mother so as not to cry. Good. But you still get better. September 4, 1942 the glorious son of the Spanish people died Hero of the Soviet Union Captain Ruben. Ibarruri Comrade Stalin, the situation in Stalingrad is difficult. All measures are taken. To defend. Stalingrad. But the city leadership has an opinion about the need for evacuation population beyond the Volga. If evacuation begins or mining of the plant, then these actions will be understood as a decision to pass. Stalingrad. Therefore. State Defense Committee prohibits evacuation. I obey! The enemy threw all aviation at Stalingrad its 4th air fleet. That evening 600 planes bombed the city. Filmed from the Caucasus, 4th German Panzer Army September 10 pushed our units to the outskirts of Stalingrad and went to the Volga, cutting off 62 army. In the south of Stalingrad there was a serious danger of encirclement. You can not wait until the enemy closes the ring. It is necessary to withdraw troops. Not! I do not allow army withdrawal! What! Please allow in order to preserve the forces of the army Allocate 3 divisions of the left flank to the middle defensive contour. To leave the Don border ourselves? Do you remember order 227? So, I demand! Eliminate the enemy breakthrough to the Volga on our own, everything! Got it? Do you know what I saw today? At Unter den Linden fenced new ruins and made the inscription on the fence: "Construction work is underway." Someone signed in capital letters. "Work Producer. - Winston Churchill." How long will you stay in Berlin? Tomorrow I’ll leave for Hamburg, and then back to the sea. Father all guards the old woman England. We hold the old woman tight by the throat. So far, they have nothing to think about the second front. They don’t think. Now everything is decided under. Stalingrad. Ah, you said that Russians can predict our blow to Stalingrad? I too believed in their common sense. Well, friends, quickly to the table. Mr. Crime Advisor, the car you saw in raien where was the broadcast from standing at the house of Schulzaboyzen. The house gathered a lot of guests. And if you need to install behind them surveillance, reinforcement required. What is the full name? Harro Schulzeboisen. A group of agents is about to leave. Keep watching. Urgently file a file on Harro. Schulzeboisen. Says crime adviser. Penziger, radiogram captured in Brussels, decrypted? Who could know the text of the radiogram? I am writing down. Three persons from the ministry navy. To whom? To Gerring, his deputy general Yeshenyk and Abwehr Harro Service Officer. Schulzeboisen. How is the radiogram signed? Chorus. The card read that Harro Schultzeboizen - descendant of the famous admiral von Tirbits. What does he protect himself Reich Marshal Gerring. But at the same time it was written that 9 years ago. Schulzeboisen was arrested on charges of anti-Nazi activities. They released him by order of the same. Gerringa. There was something to think about. Let's take a risk. Harro Schultzeboizena was arrested 30 August c. Ministry of Air fleet. Warn almost nobody failed. In a few days other members were also arrested. Red chapel. Hitler was in Ukraine at the rate near Vinnitsa. Summer offensive on Stalingrad was in full swing. And yet, when he was informed of the arrests, he dropped everything and flew to Berlin. Keep the arrests secret. Not a single word in print, or on the radio. For the disclosure of any materials there can be only one punishment - the death penalty. My Fuehrer, the investigation will make them speak. Arrest subject torture. Even if it will lead to their death. Lieutenant General Chuykov. Hi. Sit down, Vasily Ivanovich. Sit down. The Germans decided to take it at any cost. Stalingrad. But we will not give it to the fascists. You can’t retreat anymore and nowhere to go. Retreat is the end. Commander of the 62nd Army Lopatin believes that his armies the city will not be held. Instead of standing to the death die, but not let the enemy go to the Volga, he thinks about how to take the parts. Therefore, removed from command. And you, Vasily Ivanovich, we then called to offer a new position Commander of the 62nd Army. The situation in the army is very tense. How are you, comrade Chuykov? Do you understand the task? What i think? I think there will be order. Let them meet - meet you to rip their god into the soul. While I'm alive, not one the fascist curvy will not work for me. I understood the task correctly. I think the question the appointment is decided. Here is my hand, Vasily Ivanovich. And sooner our hands will dry out, than we will surrender Stalingrad. Even stepping over our corpses, the enemy must not take mountains. Clear? Clear. I don’t hear, huh? Well, you can say louder, huh? What? Well? I am Seagulls. I am Krylov. What? How many boxes do you have? One? In the 6th brigade, one tank remained. And how about the neighbors? Clear. The other two brigades are completely without tanks. The third is listening! What, no nails left? All bent? Commander 87 passes, no people. One headquarters remained. Where are my deputies? Your tank deputies artillery, engineering troops fell ill. And ask to send them to the east bank of the Volga. Did everyone get sick right away? Yes, all at once. Once sick, let them roll. Ah, Kuzma Akimovich! So we met! Well, how's the spirit? Tall? Of course, we’re not losing heart, but one spirit is not enough. We need infantry and tanks. Someday everything will be. Vasily Ivanovich, in us General Lopatin removed from the command of the army. Not wanting to leave. Stalingrad without direct order, Lopatin stayed here. And the front command forgot about him. Where is he? Behind the partition. Wow. I will give you the army. Or what is left of her. There is an aimless struggle. You can’t defend Stalingrad. You will die here. Or they’ll shoot you. For the surrender of the city. Leaving for the east coast? You understand? Understand. Do you give me the order? Yes. I give it. Now I will go. The enemy decided to destroy us at all costs. For our part, we should not just defend. We must counterattack. And at every opportunity, Remember what Suvorov said? To surprise is to win! We will counterattack. Take the initiative and confuse the Germans. Let's try to surprise!
