You can never stop a cholo on the prowl my pano's low to my eyes, covering my eyebrows. Have I shed more blood or tears I don't know.

Sin verguenza como nada Por vida, I've been down for years Lifestyle... Puro Blood And Tears Mi vida, soy traficante surrounded by cuetes, tears and sangre Por vida, I've been down for years Lifestyle... Puro Blood And Tears Mi vida, soy traficante surrounded by cuetes, tears and sangre Nine years... nine years behind these walls... Nine years without my hyna. Nine years without my familia. And nine years without seeing my little daughter grow up. I can't believe this day is finally here. I can't believe I've finally paid my debt. At least in the law's eyes I've paid my debt. But you never know about retaliation in the streets, bro. Man, I've been here for so long, I actually got used to it. I'm actually kind of scared I'm leaving. I just don't know what to expect out there, man. If my homeboys are expecting a veterano, they ain't getting it. 'Cause all that matters now is correcting my mistakes. I can't go back to that life. I have to make a better future for my daughter, but at the same time I can't just lose my respect like that. I told my homeboys "por vida," but these nine years have been "por vida." (rap song plays) "Por vida, I've been down for years." "Lifestyle..." "puro Blood and Tears." "Mi vida," "Soy traficante." "Surrounded by cuetes," "Tears and sangre..." (rap beat continues) She was the most beautiful thing I had ever held in my arms. Just knowing that she existed got me through the nine years. Your brother's getting out of jail today, huh? Yeah. I can't wait to see him. Patricia and my niece are getting him right now. I'm starting to get nervous. - What do you gotta be nervous about? I'm the one who should be nervous. Does he know about us? Man, last time he seen us both. We were playing Legos together. - What are you talking about? He was your brother's best friend. What do you think he was in there for? He wouldn't have done that for nobody else. - Man, I miss my brother. I just hope he accepts us. (whistling from afar) Damn! - Don't go over there. - Don't worry. I'ma handle my business. Stay here, I'll be right back. (birds chirping) (kids yelling in park) (kids continue playing and yelling) What's up? What'chu want? - All I wanna do is ask you some questions, pee-wee. - The fuck you want? (cross talk) -Heard your lady's punk-ass brother's getting out tonight. First of all, he ain't no punk-ass. And if he heard that shit he'd fuck both you guys up! Second of all, my name ain't pee-wee. It's Christo. So this is puro DRF aqui! I don't care how old you guys are. Don't be coming around my neighborhood and disrespecting in front of my lady! Man, fuck your lady and fuck her brother tambien, eh! (gun shots) (rap song plays) "It's darkest when it rains." "And when it rains it pours. My heart is full pain, my eyes are so damn sore. The tears I shed are real." "Man, sorrow's all I feel. I don't know how to deal, your death is so surreal." "When you passed away, my life completely shattered." "When you lose a loved one nothing really matters." I know you left this world, but sometimes I think 'it can't be.'" You meant so much to many, they've all cried plenty." I know that you're in heaven, looking down from up above." "In the arms of God, know you're always loved." "You'll never be forgotten. I know we'll meet again. This jam is dedicated to your family and your friends." "Ashes to ashes and dust to dust" - What's up, man? - What's up? Where is everybody? Everybody left or what? Yeah, man. I'm the last one here. - So where's Tony at? He took my sister and my lady home. (sighs) I can't believe my homecoming, man. I thought it was gonna be a party, holmes. Not no funeral... What happened, eh..? Man... you know who it was, man. It was Borunda Street. - Borunda Street..? Them vatos are still around? Man, tell me exactly what happened, holmes. I asked my sister, eh. She ain't talking. (sighs) Man, Christo and your sister were just kicking back at the park, man. Them fools came up to them. You know, starting trouble. - Yeah, but for what, man? I don't understand. Man, they started disrespecting your name, ya know what I'm saying? In front of your sister... Ya know, trying to punk Christo. Christo didn't take their shit, socked one of them in the mouth, and they blasted him and took off running like cowards, man. You're telling me Christo got blasted for me? Because of me? Nah, man. It's 'cause of what you did to their primo, man. 'Cause of what you did to their primo Chico. I guess they just waited, ya know, till you got out to start some trouble. I already paid for that nine years ago for blasting that vato, man. Chico blasted my camarada. I blasted Chico, eh. Capone and all his little chavalita friends, holmes, all they wanna do is earn some stripes. You know what, eh..? Let's meet up at your pad tonight. Alright, bro. So what were you and the vatos talking about earlier? - Nothing. Just catching up. So you think I'm stupid? I'm from the barrio too. I know that that they're planning some kind of revenge and I know that they look up to you, and they're waiting for you to tell them what to do. Look, I don't wanna start arguing already. I've only been out three days. I'm just gonna go over there tonight just so I know what's going on. For what? What are you trying to prove? You said you didn't wanna live that life anymore. Who said anything about proving anything? I'm just gonna go see how they are. I haven't seen them vatos in nine years. - You haven't seen us in nine years and we're you familia! - My homeboys are my familia too! Patricia, you know that love you and Angelica more than anything. When Jose was dying, I made a promise to him that I'd take care of Christo and not let him follow in our footsteps. I've only been out for three days and I've already failed! You are not responsible for Christo's death. You could not have prevented it. Look, Christo took his own path. He chose it! He chose the clicka! You don't understand, alright? Jose was dying in my arms when I promised him that I would take care of Christo! I should've been there to protect him! Look... I'm sorry, ok? I didn't mean to yell at you. I'm not mad at you. It's just not what I expected when I got out. You're not a gangster anymore. You don't have to live that life. I love you, but I can't do this again. I'm gonna go through that again. I've already paid my price. I'm not going back. I'm not stupid. I just gotta go and try to convince the homeboys that none of this is worth it. I gotta do it. For Jose and for Christo. Look, I know that they're all your homeboys, but you guys all have hot heads right now... I just don't want you to do anything stupid. I don't want you to leave me without a man and I don't want you to leave Angelica without a father. When you were in prison, you had a chance to get your life straight. If you get involved in this bullshit you're gonna get yourself killed. Look, I'll be back in a couple hours, alright? I'm just gonna be at Torcido's. Gimme a kiss, baby. I'll see you, ok? Before you go to bed. I'll read you a story. -Okay, daddy. -I love you. -I love you too. Be careful, ok? -Ok. -I love you. - Don't worry. - Ok. (sighs) Damn, man. I was beginning to think you weren't gonna show up. Ah, I was just getting some dinner, eh. Couldn't just leave the house like that. - Yeah, I understand. So, was she giving you a lot of shit? - What do you think, man? She just don't want me going back to the pinta. Eh, man, now that you're out, none of us want you going back, though. You know what I mean? Eh, uh, your sister, how is she taking it? She's a wreck, man. All she could do was nod, eh, when I asked her if it was those levas from Borrunda Street. I know exactly who was, man. It was that faggot Chepe and Neto... Everything's been calm, man, for a long time. Then they found out you were getting out. - Yeah, but why they trippin' on me, man? Why're they trippin' 'cause I left? 'Cause I got out? I don't know, man, but all them fucking putos are related, you know? Neto, Capone, Chepe... All them fuckers. You took out Chico, so they took it hella personal. You know? Regardless of what happened to Jose. They feel nine years wasn't enough. That's what I figure, you know? Fuckers want revenge... - Christo, man... Who pulled the trigger? Does it matter, holmes? - Fuck yeah, it matters! - Sabes que? As far as i'm concerned. They all pulled the fucking trigger, man. Besides, you know Capone's behind the whole thing, eh. He's the oldest and he's the one who was closest to Chico. Man, I don't care about Capone. I don't care about Borrunda street. I just wanna know the vato that pulled the trigger. Word on the street is, it was that faggot Neto. But Chepe was with him, you know what I'm saying? Like I said. Neto, huh..? What the hell was Chepe doing with him? Little punk chavala. Last time I saw him he was ten-years-old... sniffing paint, writing on walls. - Yeah, but them youngsters fucking grow up, know what I mean? Motherfucker thinks he's hard now, trying to earn some stripes and shit, trying to make a name. Earn stripes..? Only thing that vato's gonna earn is some valas... Who's got a cuete..? - I got one, holmes... But you know what? You don't gotta trip, man. Like you said earlier, you don't wanna end up back in the pinta, so you ain't gotta get involved, holmes. Shit, I'll personally shoot that puto in the face myself, man. Look, holmes, Jose and Christo were like my carnales... Our fathers started DRF, bro. You weren't there nine years ago, eh. Jose died in my arms, man. I made a promise to him that I would always take care of Christo. Yeah, man, but promises are hard to keep when you're locked down like that, you know? Behind them walls there ain't shit you can do. Homeboy meant a lot to me. He meant a lot to all of us, eh. You don't understand, eh. The day I got out Christo died. He got killed, eh... All because of me... Now it's time for some payback. Nah, chale, eh. This ain't about payback. It's about honor. - Orale, I feel you bro. Whatever you wanna do, shit, I'm down with it, man. You wanna ride on these putos? Let's ride, man. Let's ride. -Orale (cross talk) Tell us again how it happened. - Yeah, tell 'em, holmes. Alright. Check it out. Me and Neto, walking through the park, right? Like Borrunda Street always does. This little punk-ass pee wee starts acting up, like he's big-shit or something... anyways, little pee wee, starts disrespecting. Trying to act like he got balls. Telling us we're in DRF territory, and Neto was like "Fuck you, punk, we're taking over your barrio." - Yeah, man, all we're doing is going out there, selling dope to punks in their own barrio. - That's not what I heard. - Yeah? So what'd you hear? I heard Chepe got slapped in the mouth. (girls laugh) What..? Hell no, I didn't get slapped. Think I'd let some... pussy slap me? Only slapping there's gonna be is if you keep opening your fat mouth! Damn, kick back. I was just playing with you. Yeah, so you wanna hear what really happened or what? - Yeah, go on. -Well then, shut up and listen then! (scoffs) Anyways... this punk gets brave, right? Tries to throw a punch. Neto dodges it and beat his ass. And then when we're leaving, coward pulls out a filero and tries to shank Neto from behind... so... I pulled out my cuete. (cocks gun) Shot that puto down. -Yeah, man. The only reason we ran is because his bitch was screaming so damn loud, we were scared the pinche chota was gonna come. (Chepe laughs) That's the crazy-ass story, eh. - Hell yeah. You vatos are crazy. Crazy, huh..? You vatos think was you did was crazy..? All you did was let Dyno know our clicka's got it out for him. You think what you did earned you some stripes..? Huh..? Look, holmes. I don't give a damn about some 18-year-old pee wee. All I told you is that I want Dyno's head on a platter. And you couldn't even get that right. So what? Do I gotta do everything myself? He killed my primo. He killed your primo. And all you vatos can do is sit here and brag to these rucas about what kind of balls you got? Come on, holmes. He wasn't just a pee wee, eh. He was Jose's brother. Besides he was talking crazy. What was I supposed to do? Huh? All I told you to do was find out where Dyno was at. Now we gotta let things calm down before we could do anything. Eh, Giggles... Go get me a beer, yeah..? -Eh, get me one too, eh! Eh..! You're out of beer! You're out of beer! -So? -So go get some, if you wanna get some. Me entiendes? -Eh, um... what about them vatos from DRF? (scoffs) What about 'em? - What if they're out looking for us? Oh, you're a big man at the park, but you're afraid to go to the liquor store at night? - Shit, I don't give a fuck. I'll go to the liquor store, eh. What do you guys want, eh? You guys want some 40s or what? -That'll be tight, holmes. -Yeah. -Hook it up. -Alright. Pase me el cuete, eh. -Eh, Neto, be careful, alright? - Yeah, simon, eh. - Orale, holmes. - I'll be back, eh. Alrato. - Yup.

It's been a long time... Can we come in..? - What's going on? -Hello, ma'am. I'm Detective Estrada. This is Detective Fuhrman. -Just call me Mark. - I know who you are. What are you doing here? We need to ask Dyno a few questions, if we could. The hell you guys want? Look, man. I know you're mad at me for nine years ago, but I truly believe that I was saving your life. And I had a job to do. Just like I'm doing my job now. I need to ask you a few questions about last night, that's all. Look, holmes, I've been straight for nine years already, eh. You didn't save me from nothing, man. All you did was take me away from my family, little daughter had to grow up without me. You got no business here! -Look, you fucking convict..! -Man, why don't you watch your mouth, man? I got a little girl in the other room! -That's all, Mark. Why don't you go take a walk? I can handle this. (door closes hard) What's up with that gavacho, man, thinking he can come to my house, talk to me like that? - He has a problem with gangbangers. Oh? That was nine years ago. I don't see any gangbangers in this house now. 27 years old now. - I need to know exactly where you were last night. I was here, with my lady and my daughter. Are you lying to me? - What are you accusing me of? I'm not accusing you of anything. It's kind of funny that the day you get out of prison, one of your young homies is gunned down. And then last night, one of the rival gang members is found with his face shot off in a liquor store. Now, call me stupid, but it sounds like Jose and Dyno are running the streets all over again. Like I said, man. I was here with my lady and my daughter... Is that all? For now, Dyno... For now. So what'd the convict have to say? Well, he claims he was with his girl his young daughter all night long. Ah, he's full of shit, man. Either he did it or he knows who did it. - Well... we're back to square one. We're fucked, and yelling at Dyno isn't going to break him. Yeah, but my billy club will. - Funny, Fuhrman. Real funny. -Come on, man. Let's go get some donuts. -Yeah. I thought you said nothing was gonna happen last night? You promised me! You promised me! - I don't wanna talk about it. What were you thinking? You've been out three days! What, do you wanna go right back? -Four. -Four, what? - Four days. You just said three. I've been out for four days. - You know what? This is not a fucking joke, Dyno! You're fucking with my life! You're fucking with our life! - Why do you cuss so much, man? Is that the way you talk around here? I don't want you raising my daughter talking like that! You know what? I raised her for nine fucking years with you, ok? Nine! So don't you dare give me any shit about that. -Look... I didn't do nothing, ok? I went and talked to the homeboy just like I told you. Whatever they did is on them. How can you sit there and lie to me to my face like that? - They would've arrested me right now if I would've done anything. Look... I'm just really worried about you... and I'm really worried about us. And I don't want anything to come... (whimpers) between our family... again. - Patricia... Listen... I'm never gonna let nothing get in-between me, you, and my daughter again. I promise you. I'm done with all this drama. Finished. -Are you guys fighting? -Oh no, mija, no. You just woke up, baby? -Yeah. -I love you. You want breakfast? - Want breakfast? Come on. Sit down. - What do you guys want? You want eggs? -Yeah. -Yeah. -Ok. (music starts) (music fades) Orale! What's up, Dyno? Come here, locote! -What's up? -What's up, holmes? - Man, this vato right here's the craziest, carnal. - I thought I told you not to talk about that. Relax, holmes. We're all carnales here, eh. Ain't no disrespect, holmes. Eh, you can't keep talking about that shit though, eh. If people at the park find out about that we'll all be fucked. -Orale. -You know how these fuckers talk. - So what's up, man? What's on your mind? - Man, we gotta keep this on the low down. Detectives came over my house this morning, man. Asking me all kinds of questions. -Oh yeah? -What? -Like that..? Patricia got all on my case. She doesn't even know nothing about this, man, and I don't want her to know. So what the fuck'd the pigs ask you, man? They were asking me all kinds of questions, eh... Estrada, man. Remember that vato that busted me nine years ago? Came with some new gavacho, eh. Talking all kinds of masa to me. Call me a convict in my own house. (scoffs) -Convict? - Fuck Estrada, dude. That dude's a fucking bitch! I hate that punk-ass pig. Nah, he's, he's alright, eh. He's just on the wrong side... Anyways, eh. He starts asking me where I was last night. Started telling me about some vato that got his face blow off in a liquor store. (laughs) Orale. I mean, of course I denied knowing anything. But... He's gonna be back. Man, fuck that shit, ese. That punk was only the beginning, holmes We're gonna rid our whole town of them fools, man. Fuck Borrunda Street, eh. What are you talking about, eh? My business is done, eh. I'm finished. Aqui para. You think I care about Borrunda Street? All I care about... is my familia. That vato that killed Christo, is history. He's gone. I kept my promise to Jose. That's it. So what the fuck you wanna do now? Just kick back, eh. It's a firme day. Kick back with the homeboys. Catch up on nine years. Take care of my family. - Orale, carnal. - Sounds firme. - Hand me a beer, holmes. (music starts) -Let me break this fool, real quick, man. (cross talk, music fades) (sighs) See what you started? I told you how he was. He's all about payback. We took out Jose... they took out Chico. Nine years later, You take out one of his pee wees... now they kill Neto... I can't believe this shit, man. I wanna kill that hijo de puta so bad I can taste it. - So what do you wanna do, man? -If that's the game they wanna play... we can play with 'em a little. We'll take out his homeboys. The ones that are closest to him. When they come back for retaliation, we'll be waiting on 'em. It'll be one big mousetrap. What about the cops, ese? You know they'll be watching us. Much I don't give a damn I know... I don't give a damn. Been waiting nine years to pay this puto back. I'll be damned if I let this shit ride now. - His homeboy, Tony... He's always at the park selling weed. That bitch Giggles always buys twenties from him. - We can't hit him up at the park, ese. There's too many fools around. If we're blasting him there. Everybody's gonna hear us. - So we shank that motherfucker... About seven or eight times. I'll stab him till the blade snaps. I don't give a fuck. That's how I handled myself in Y.A. You're sure he's always at the park? - Hell yeah. Especially today. It's the first. - He doesn't know who you are? Nah, man. I just moved to the neighborhood. They don't even know me. What do you think, Chepe..? Sounds good to me, ese. Salva can buy the weed, I come up behind him, just let him have it. - Make sure nobody sees you, eh. I don't even wanna start trippin' with theses pigs right now. Don't even trip, bro. He doesn't sell weed out in the open. He's always in the cuts. - Orale, carnal. Handle that shit. (somber music plays) Alright... OK... Fuck! Man, no judge in the county is gonna give us a search warrant. We can't arrest him... We can't search his house... They won't even give us extra manpower... to track down he and his gangbanger friends. So what the fuck do they expect us to do..? Look, first of all, he hasn't broken any laws. We have nothing on him. The only mistake he made was nine years ago... and I really think he's learned his lesson... the only problem he has is those gangbanger friends keep trying to suck him in. Our best bet is to keep an ey on those DRF boys. We gotta put a stop to this before someone either gets hurt or killed. - Yeah, I don't really understand why they're all killing each other if they're all Hispanic. First of all, partner, they're not "Hispanic" they're chicano. They've been fighting for generations and you can't even begin to understand. Some these kids grew up in an unstable family with no money, and the only people they had were each other. it's not uncommon to see sons, fathers and even grandfather's who had belonged to the same gang. Man, you sound like one of them. - Yeah, that's because I was. But I grew up and now I'm a cop... and if I can make it out, so can some of these kids. They gotta learn that guns, drugs and even homeboys aren't the way to live. They've gotta be able to leave their neighborhood and see that they're there's a better world outside for them. - Yeah, I don't know. Regardless of their environment, they should know better. You know what? My parents raised me to be a straight arrow. Ya know? And look at me now. I got a good job, I'm an honest citizen... and you know, I've never been in trouble with the law. You're pretty lucky to have a family like that. Some of these kids only had a single mother, who worked her ass off in order to feed them. They tried to raise 'em right, but sometimes situations just got in the way... - Yeah, whatever you say, Estrada. You know, every person makes his choices and he's got to deal with the consequences, but you know regardless of our opinions of these kids, they're still out there killing people and we gotta stop it. So what do you wanna do now? I think we should go have a conversation with the other gang. Ah, you mean the boys from Borrunda Street. -Yeah. Capone Gonzalez. (music fades) What's up, man? Do I know you? Nah, bro. I kick it with that girl Giggles. She said you got some bomb ass weed. I wanna get a quarter "O." Giggles, huh? What barrio you from, holmes? Nah, bro. I don't bang. I'm a hustler. I'm just trying to make some money and smoke some weed. -Fuck! Ahh! Motherfucker! (rap song starts) "First off, rest in peace to my homie Felipe," "I got a little somethin' to say, so why don'tcha peep it?" "Deep shit, like this, don't happen ev-er-y day, and true friends like you are really hard to find, eh..." "But this is my way of lettin' you know..." (song fades) (loud knock on door) Go get the door. -You go get it. (another loud knock) Oh shit, it's the cops. Hurry up and get upstairs. Ah, what do you want, Estrada? - We have a few questions to ask you. May we come in? -Like I have a choice. Come in. -Thank you. So what's this about? - Well, I assume you've heard of your old friend Dyno being released from prison a few days ago. Oh yeah..? What's that got to do with me? Well, I also assume that you've heard of the two homicides between Borrunda Street and DRF. - Like I said, what's that got to do with me? - Look, man! Cut the bullshit! We know that Borrunda Street is involved with the murder of Christo Lopez. - Look, I don't have nothing to do with street gangs. I'm tool old for that. You're wasting your time, you're wasting my time. Why don't you guys go chase some real gang members? - Look, you son of a bitch! The only reason why you're not in cuffs right now is because we don't have enough evidence on you yet. - Why do you always have to play these games, Capone? You know, that I know, that you're the "mero mero" of Borrunda Street. Nothing happens without your say so. - Look, officer, I'm an honest citizen. I don't appreciate you guys coming here calling me a gang member, or a gang-leader, just because I live in a bad neighborhood. - Why do you keep acting stupid like that? Don't you know there's been two homicides in four days? You're gonna have to talk to us sometime... say anything. How many people must die before this thing ends? How many..? (scoffs) -You think it's funny? You think it's a joke..? - Look, I know my rights okay? I don't have to tell you shit. So, unless I'm under arrest, you can get out. (pager goes off) Damn! Can I use your phone, real quick..? What'cha got..? Where..? When..? Were there any witnesses..? Alright, we'll be right there. Damn! Mark, there was a homicide in the park. Tony Legrand. We gotta go. And let me tell you something you piece of trash. When I find out you were involved with the murders I'm gonna nail your ass to the fucking wall! You hear me? -Whatever. Get the fuck out. -You hear me? -Fuck out. (door slams) Fucking pigs. I love you. Huh..? Why'd you say that? What? You're not gonna say it back? (scoffs) -You know I love you... but I mean, why now? I'm just happy. I haven't been this happy in nine years. I haven't been this happy either... You know that job your dad offered me? - Mm-hmm. - I'm gonna take it. This barrio's gonna drive me crazy if I stay here. - You know, when you were locked up I used to jump in the car and drive to the hills and look at all those big white houses, white picket fences, and green grass... and the kids playing in the yard... and I used to just sit there and imagine that we live there. I just want Angelica to have a different childhood than we had. I want her to have a happy childhood and these last nine years have not been happy. - I'm happy, mommy. -I know you are, mija. - You know... I'm gonna get us out of here. No matter what. - When..? We don't have to move into a big house, I just wanna get off this street. If I can start that job Monday, in one month, I could have the deposit... and with your check, you can pay the first month's rent. And we can do it... together! - I hope so, babe. What about your homeboys? - My homeboys will always be my homeboys, but you're my responsibility... both of you mean everything to me, I don't care about nothing else. I just don't know what I would do without you. (knock on door) Oh... Come in! (door opens and closes) Hey, Torcido. -Hey, how's it going? You want something to drink? - Nah, I just need to borrow your man for a second. What's up, eh? - I need to talk to you outside, just for like a minute. I'll be right outside, ok..? What's going on, bro? - They found Tony shanked to death at the park this morning... Nobody saw nothing. What..? Who, Borrunda Street..? - Borrunda Street or some fucking dopefied, man... but my money's on first. - Man, it's gotta be those punks, eh. After what we did to that vato the other night... How the hell are we gonna retaliate, man? There's probably pigs all over the place. - Shit, man, that fucking sellout motherfucker Estrada, man, was walking around questioning everybody, man. Grilled me for fucking half an hour. - Did they arrest anybody? Nah, man. I'm telling you there were no witnesses.. but you and I both know who did it. I can't believe all this crap in four days, man. What the hell's Capone's problem, eh? Starting a gang war, man... nine years later... I managed to move on. I lost my homeboy nine years ago. Look, man. I don't know about you, I mean, I know you got your family to worry about and all that shit, but me and the homeboys are getting together tomorrow morning at my pad and doing something about it. Simon, eh. I'm in, eh. I'm down. Just wait for me, eh. Get the homeboys there and I'll be there. - Alright, man. Are you sure nobody saw you at the park? - Yeah, ese. I'm positive. We caught him by surprise. Eh, you should've seen the face he made, man. That shit was funny. (laughter) I don't care about his face, holmes. All I care about is that nobody saw you two there. Ya know, the cops came by here earlier. I don't need that kinda heat right now. For all you know they're watching us. -Man, you're being paranoid. - Am I talking to you, pendejo? - He was by himself, in the cuts. Nobody was there. Nobody saw us. - You're the one that got us in this mess in the first place. If you would've killed Dyno, like I told you, everything would be cool right now. So tomorrow you you're so fucking her right now. So shut your mouth... And you, you're so fucking high right now, you probably stabbed the wrong vato. This ain't a game, carnal. You need to lay off that mota, man. - No disrespect, but you don't have to come at me like that. I get high, but I handle my business. - Yeah, look, everything's fucked, man. The pigs are on to us and Dyno knows we're after him now. If we make the wrong move, it's over. I can't get another strike, ese. Or I'll go in for life. They already know we're behind it all, so we gotta keep our cover cool, you know? -I feel you, man. -You feel that? -So what are we gonna do now? I mean, Dyno's gonna be after us, right? We gotta hit him. We gotta hit him hard, ese. That ruca Giggles, she's gonna find out where that fool Dyno lives. - Good, holmes. That's real good. That way we could finish this vato once and for all. I won't rest until Dyno's a memory. Here's the coroner's report. -So, what'd he say? -Nothing... no signs of a struggle. Multiple stab wounds to the lower chest. No murder weapon, no witnesses. Nothing. Just like the other two. - Well, we know all three are gang-related. We have no evidence. It must've been somebody they trusted. Somebody that wasn't threatening to them. - Oh, so you think that maybe it could be their own gang? Dyno? Dyno..? Nah... have you read his prison file? He's been straight for nine years. I don't think he wants to get back into that life. Especially after seeing his young daughter. - Look man, I'm just not convinced. I think both these guys are involved with all three murders. I don't know. They're just playing God and we're just cleaning up the mess. Look, there's gotta be a witness somewhere. He had priors for sales and we found baggies of weed on him. There's gotta be some pot-head out there willing to talk. I don't know, man. We've already questioned everybody on the scene. So? We question them again. We don't wanna gang war on our hands. It seems like it's already too late for that. - We need to bring in every snitch, every dopefiend in the city. We grill 'em, frame 'em into talking. Do whatever it takes What about Dyno's girl? Why don't we bring her in? Dyno's girl? You got to be crazy. She's been a working mother for the past nine years Dyno's been in. She's straight as an arrow... and if I know her like I think I know her, she's making sure Dyno keeps straight. - Yeah, but what about Capone? What girls does he hang out with? There's gotta be a neighborhood slut or something. - Hmm, I guess we'll just have to find out who. - We gotta do a stakeout. -Stakeout. What the fuck, man? Where the fuck have you been? Relax, man. Had to make up a good excuse. She's all trippin' and stressin' on me. - Eh, man. You ain't ever gonna guess what the fuck we just found out, fool. -What? -Tell him, Castro. -It wasn't Neto, man. It was fucking Chepe. Now he's running around talking all kinds of loud shit... Telling everybody, fucking it was him. Even told some bitches, dude. Now these bitches are running around. They told my cousin, told me Now he's talking all kinds of shit, like WE started it, saying he stabbed Tony 'cause of Neto's death. Fuck that punk, dude. (scoffs) So it was Chepe..? -Yeah. -Punk, man. Should've killed all them vatos the other night. (sighs) Now we gotta kill Chepe, before I'm out. -Check it out, man. I know where this motherfucker Capone lives at, eh. I think we should go there right now, kill that motherfucker before he gets us. - Yeah, man, as much as I'd love to do that right now, we can't. Man, you know Estrada is all over us, man. He's watching us. Everything we do, man. We can't. I'm not going back, eh. No matter what. Well, maybe we can get some other hood to kill that motherfucker for us. You crazy? Can't trust nobody... fucking... who you gonna trust..? - Hey, wait a second, man. That's a firme idea, eh. I know exactly who... -Who? This black homeboy. He was in the pinta with me. That vato owes me a favor. - Yeah? What kind of favor? - It's a long story, eh, but... that vato owes me his life... Paroled about a month before me. I got his numbers, address, everything, eh. Get a hold of him. - Yeah, but is he down, though? Ya know what I mean? Can he do the job, ya know? Is he gonna punk out or some shit? - That fool's crazy, man. He's a shooter for set. Fool did seven years just 'cause some dude slapped his sister. Attempted murder. Hell yeah, that fool's crazy. He'll do it for fun. Matter of fact, he'll do it just to get even. So he don't owe me nothing. He hates owing people. - So, that's the plan, huh? Yeah. Hell yeah... You still got that throw-away cuete? Yeah, it's at my girls house, man. I gotta get it. - Alright. Check it out, eh. Go ahead and get that. I'ma go to a pay phone and call him up, eh. I'ma set the whole meeting up. I don't want to do it. It's too hot for me. So just... wait for my call. -Alright, man. (cross talk) Hello..? Is Wyno there..? Eh... it's me, Dyno, eh. What's up, man..? Yeah, simon, eh. I finally got out... Anyways, let me get to the point, eh. Yeah. Yeah. Remember that big favor you owe me? Yeah. I'm calling to collect. I need a big favor, eh... Nah, nah. I don't want to talk about it on the phone, eh. I need you to meet one of my good homeboys today, man. He'll tell you about everything, eh. Tell you about all the details. I can't do it... Nah... I'm too hot right now, eh... Anyways, eh... His name's Torcido... Yeah, he could pick you up at your pad in about an hour... What's the address... Yeah... Yeah, I know where that is, eh... Yeah. Alright... Got it... Alright, holmes... Later. (ominous music starts) (car engine revs, music fades) Alright, here's the plan... There's this faggot names Chepe. He's from Borrunda Street. Lives in that white House over there. - Yeah, I know that tweakin' ass nigga. I sell that fool crank all the time. That nigga still owe me money. That's great. Shut up and listen. I want you to go over there. You shoot him. Make sure he's dead. Grab the gun. Dump it and just keep your mouth shut... (scoffs) -Man... -and don't be doing nothing retard like throwing the gun out the window. (scoffs) What'chu think I am? Some type of little thug or something? Nigga, I just got out the pen! - Look, I don't give a fuck if you just got back from hell. I'm telling you what Dyno told me to tell you... Now, you sell crank to this faggot, you know what he looks like, so... -Yeah, nigga. I already told you. -Alright, man... (pistol clicks) I want you to empty this entire clip on that motherfucker. For sure. I live for this type of shit. And you know, wear some motherfucking gloves, man. I don't want this shit coming back to me. (scoffs) Man, you lucky I owe Dyno this favor. (Scoffs) -Whatever, tough-guy. (engine starts) (car is put in gear) (ominous music plays) (music fades) Eh, did you hook up with Wyno today? - Yeah, he's gonna handle it... but I don't really like that fool, man. Why, man? He's hella cool. - He's got a big mouth, man. Kept talking all that shit about how crazy he was and how hard he is and... Just got on my nerves, man. I wanted to shoot that motherfucker myself. (scoffs) -He's hella cool, man. We did time together, eh. That vato's down to do anything. - Whatever, man it's done. So, Chepe should be dead by nightfall. - Still wish I was was the one that would've done it, man. -Hey guys, what's going on? -Oh, damn. Just wanted to see if you guys wanted to go to a little get-together tonight. You know, a little party. -No, but I told him we're just gonna kick back here tonight. -Alright. You guys can come inside, but be quiet 'cause Angelica's taking a nap. - Uh, well, we were just heading out right now anyway, so... - Alright, bye. - See ya. - Bye. -Eh, man, you got a cuete in the pad? - Nah, I don't got nothing, eh. - Eh man, you should be careful though, know what I mean? Gotta have something. - Can't have nothing in the house, man. I'm on parole. Will you shut that door, man? I'd still feel better if you had something around the pad. You know what I mean? For your own protection and shit. Got your daughter, your old lady. Never know what these fools might do. Know what I mean? - He's right, man. Better to be caught with than without. Take it, holmes... Stash it... It's better, ya know? Just give me a call, man. Just let me know whatever happens. -Alright, man. We're out. (ominous rap beat starts) "Let me start shit off by saying it's Northside till I die..." "So recognize you get chastised by my two 4-5s.." "When you hear that click-clack, you better get back before you feel the boom..." "Comin' up out of that..." (music slowly fades) Alright, ese... I'll be there in ten minutes... Later. (hangs up phone) (ominous rap songs fades back in) (engine revs, B.A.R.T. train running overhead) "Better have ya mask on, nigga, don't let 'em see ya face..." (music slowly fades) Eh... 'sup, nigga..? - Wyno... eh, I ain't got no time to talk right now, ese. - Eh, what's up with that money you owe me? Ah, shit, holmes. I got bigger problems that that right now. - Yeah, you do. (gun shot) (engine revs, music fades back in) (car speeds off) (music fades) Man, I ain't kill nobody, man. You ain't got shit on me. - We got enough to hold you. - Hold me for what? - We have eyewitness that place you, and an unidentified suspect and your vehicle, within an hour the murder... and we know you belong to DRF. -So fucking what? -Hey, man. Do you recognize this gun? We just found it three blocks from the murder scene. - Nah, man. I don't shoot guns. Too dangerous. We have the murder weapon. All we're waiting for now is the bullet case prints... and when they come in, it's over. So you better start talking to us now. Was Dyno with you in the car..? (scoffs) You gotta be stupid as fuck, man, trying to pull some bullshit like this on me. The fuck you think I am? Some kind of pee wee or something? You ain't got shit on me but suspicion, man. (scoffs) I don't gotta tell you shit and I ain't gonna tell you shit. So go fuck yourself, pig. - Look, you fucking scumbag..! - Who's the other guy? Was it Dyno? Who the fuck's this peckerwood think he's scaring, man? You need to get the fucking grand dragon off me. That's enough, Mark. - Piece of shit. - Don't play dumb with me... The bottom line is that I'm the only friend you got... so you better start talking to me now. All we gotta do is scare Dyno just a little bit... and he'll roll over on you... 'cause he doesn't want to do another nine years. (scoffs) Just give me my fucking phone call you fucking coconut. Now what's that supposed to mean? You're just another sellout, man... brown on the outside, white on the inside. Man, holmes. Fuck the pigs! I'ma kill that motherfucker tomorrow. Dyno, his ass is as good as dead... - What makes you so sure it was Dyno? When I talked to Chepe's neighbor's they said it was a mayate. - Man, fuck that, holmes. He's dying anyway, ese. Giggles, you got that address, right? Yeah, I got it. -He lives on Elmwood. -Elmwood? - Here it is. - So you wanna hit him up, tonight? Nah, chale, holmes. We'll hit him up in the morning when he least expects it. I got something for that vato with his name on it. (pistol cocks) 'Sup, bro..?

Some bullshit like an hour between the murder... Yeah, they got some murder weapon and shit. They're waiting for prints to come back from the casing, but I know they're just fucking with me... Yeah, I already know that shit, man... Yeah, I told them what I know. I know nothing... Yeah, I've been trying, man, but it ain't working...

Alright, I'll be ready by then... Shoot by there... Alright, later. Where's the coffee..? - I got something better than coffee. -Oh yeah? Yeah. I got witnesses. -Where..?

"And murder for my block, my respect, my corazon..." (song fades) I just wanna tell him that we have a witness. We just gotta put a stop to all of this. - Man, I don't know why you're worried about Dyno. We should just go arrest Capone. I just feel... that I gotta do it.
