Good Morning I've been waiting for eight hours. - I refueled your father's cart. And we also have antifreeze and chains needed. Does it take an hour to buy that? - I ran out of gas. I don't like to let Papa Doc wait. - Me neither. Especially because they were brought, and we have to drive ourselves. Take your jacket. Be nice to it my father for once. Listen carefully, I'm going alone to be with you. Not for business so cut it out. We make fun and let Papa Doc and Harvey are working. A weekend with Harvey? He's okay, but his wife ... A bottle of whiskey with a teat will keep her busy. Excuse me. Bad drivers don't deserve medals. Here that watch. In the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Everyone is there, the rest are dead dead. - That's not nice, Brian. Damn it, I have a knife. Can we go now, Hannah? - Sister Hannah. Time for a ski report from the mountains. While the sun is shining in the city, the mountains are covered with snow. Nearly four meters thick at Arrowhead. The phone works in some areas not especially at Snow Valley. Who wants to ski this weekend, must provide warm clothing. Is at 1 km altitude the roadside assistance, around the snow chains to verify. A cold front is coming on. Temperatures below zero last night. Sunshine is expected tomorrow. The roadside warning warns about this the chance to get snowed in. Snowplows will be deployed. More ski news in an hour. Wait a second. I am still alive. Let me out. Nice coat. - I'm stuck. Are you OK? Just put on your jacket. There is a very long waiting list. Nothing retired, a holiday resort. Where are they staying? Ready to work? - Do you have a job for me? Without perseverance I had not been here. At the age of fourteen, mop I the Copper Haven hall. When I was 30, it was mine, with 26 others. And that without a diploma. - Quit it. If you don't like it, stay away. - You have invested too much. Get started then. Quit it. Can I help you, Papa Doc? - I'll let you know, Harv. I'm not a doctor. I have this achieved through hard work. A young doctor who might be here comes to work, likes to work overtime. It wasn't the intention that I got that job ... The bill. Stupid horn. Bring the cases in and park the car. That was your chance now, Harvey. You ruined it. I'll talk to him. Ralph, you want this to Want to bring Dad Doc? Those wet clothes have to be taken off. I turn on the light here. Are you bringing the luggage upstairs? - Ralph, you take care of that. In the top drawer, Ralph. Do you enjoy working for Papa Doc? Not when he shouts at me. He always does that. Not me. Do you like me? - You are nice. A nice lady. Lay down and come here. Brush my hair. Do you like that? - My rabbit just has hair like that. Give me the brush. Wait a second. Massage my feet. They are tired. Take off my shoes. Massage my feet now. You are very strong. - Very strong. I chopped wood ... Shows. Lift me up. I do not want to hurt you. - No. Lift me up. What are you strong. Put me down. Put me down on the bed. - On the bed? Ralph, come here. Lay down. Have you ever had a wife? What did you say? - Have you ever had a wife? A mother and two sisters, they were killed in a bus. Have you ever wanted love businesses? Touch a woman? Making out. Get up. Take off your shirt. Go. I do not want it. Take off your pants. Take off your pants. From those pants. What would you like to do now? I have to feed my rabbits. - Feed your rabbits? What is happening here? Nothing. Ralph helps me unpack. Put on your pants and go down. And close the door. What's going on here? - We had fun. You don't care what, with whom or where, huh? We don't differ that much. I do my thing, you do yours. I love Rick, we're getting married. - How nice. Fucking and still getting married? - What do you mean? I've had it before you. I can get it whenever I want. Bitch. Exercise for you the Olympics? We just had some fun. - Fun? Everyone's own. People are creepy. Not like us. They play scary games. Take off your clothes. Take off your pants and sit on the bed. Crazy games. Julie must be mad at me. I can't hold it anymore. - There is a house there. Can't we just rest? - Run through. We are being followed. Has anyone seen if he was alive? - I don't want to go back. He will never get us again. I'll put you down again. Just play. I'm coming back to feed you. I have to take care of those people. I have to find them. I have to stop them. I need sandwiches with make ham for them. But tomorrow Papa Doc wants chicken. Last time I did it not good. Too many herbs. I already know. I only put two herbs in it, that cannot go wrong. Footprints. They certainly went to that house. I have to stop them. Don't they hear us upstairs? - No, the house is well built. I looked at the back. - Is he following us? Everyone can follow follow in the snow. He is getting closer. - Is he coming for us? We will never go back. Is he dead? - I hope so. I'm hungry. Where's Susan? - She's investigating the house. I'm tired. - Let's go too. I want to sleep. - First get rid of this. What a bad day. Your father is a bother. Why don't you like him? - This is all from him. He keeps saying how much it cost. He comes here alone but to work. If you let him talk, instead of walking away ... He is trying to talk to you. Then we have a rest. I'll talk to him tomorrow. Why are we going there tomorrow not away? Sledding or something. Can't, they come after us. Not lovely, who loves from staying home. My baby is jealous. You are jealous. Did you rock her? - What do you think? No jokes, answer. Have you ever slept with her? Of course, just like everyone else. What did I say? What did you tell me? - I spoke with Papa Doc. You saw his response. That's not how I get that job. It was not the right time. This is the right time and the right place. Why are we here? For our pleasure? What are you afraid of? - I've tried it. In tennis they call it perseverance. - I also do that. At my pace. Don't insist. - Stop. I have a bursting headache. Stop drinking. - Talk about insisting. Is George dead now? - That has to be. We're going in. I'm not feeling well. Can I help? Harvey here. Are you feeling better? - Awesome. You know, Ruth ... It's a long time ago. I refill my glass, I'll be right back. Promised. Harvey. Why are you screaming like that? - Little people. What do you mean? - People, I mean. Small people, damn it. Where's that car? No idea, we walked all night. - In this weather? According to my watch in western direction from 18.15 to 07.40. Then we saw this house. - Get off that floor. On the couch. Can I have that blanket? Cover yourself. We didn't break in. - Ralph always forgets to close. The others are dead. I'm nauseous. - Wait a minute, little one. We will help you. Lovely? What now? - Hold on, little one. What is happening? - A sick girl. What should I do? Easy, I'll definitely do something. She doesn't look bad. Come with me. Everyone upstairs. Harvey? Doctor? - I'll examine them upstairs. Are you the commander? - Yes, that's him. When do we eat? - Ralph will make some cornflakes. Thirty minutes. What was that? Never played a soldier? - No time. Nonsense, you still play it. Very nice, joke. Find a job as a comedian. Crazy. Totally awesome. Where have you been? - Chopped wood. You would connect the telephone. - I did too. Then why doesn't he do it? - Is the line defective? Then fix it. You have left your post. I talked to a madman. Shoot me. Where are the others? - Hannah is in the bathroom. Have you seen George? - Why? I was wondering. - You are scared. No, certainly not for George. Grow up. What does Moe have? - She is ill. I want 60,000 a year. Expenditure financing. More respect. The summer cottage in August. Has your drink run out? What's your name? - David. You are unnecessary. - A big word for such a kid. I'm not a kid, but a man of twelve. Sorry I meant... - We had an accident. I know that. - We are the only survivors. Your parents will be happy ... - It was frightening. My resourcefulness was our salvation. We were on our way to Hollywood. - Are you an actor then? Among other things. We should make a movie. How fascinating. Green is a beautiful color. Doesn't it fit my eyes? I will. Nice fabric, bad style. I'm going again, Mr ... Harvey Beckman. - Will we become friends? Certainly why not? - Beautiful. How are you? - Fine. Can we have candles on the table? - They are already there. You are as fast as possible back with your parents. Stop that, then we can eat. Your car is in excellent condition. - Get off my car. I know a lot about cars. - Me too. Do not touch that. Do you understand me, Harv? It's better than what you get now. I just can't do it. - You are a good doctor. With your knowledge about geriatrics ... When we talk about our profession ... - Does not matter. I looked at your hair. It is very healthy. Sister, would you like to pray? Bless these gifts from Your wealth, Christ our Lord. In the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Are you not very young for a nun? - I'm a novice. Beginner. They become cheeky as they don't go to school. The new school is becoming stricter. - Get us there first. David, in which movie are you going to play? He always has great stories. Writers try first their ideas, Harvey Beckman. You have to gain experience somewhere. Can with this weather you go home tomorrow. This is a beautiful house. - It cost a lot. What are you going to do? - We're going skiing tomorrow. We have to work. - You have to work. If you go, it's over. You understand. Fire me. - How many do you have? Have you seen those guns? Lick my ass. I thought so. In Copper Haven you get a hunger wage. Can I help? I can dry. I've never been with washing a nun. We are only human. - You are very special. Thank you. If someone is bothering you, I'll arrange that for you. Are there many homeless people here? Sometimes, in the summer. Almost never in the winter. It is too far away from the road. Are you on your own here? All the time? That's pretty lonely. That does not matter. Even if there are people, no one talks to me. That is very thin. Is it strong enough? Stupid question. - Are you so smart then? With this you hoist a truck. Check the spark plug. I'll get you after this job. They say I'm strange. I make them nervous. - I like to talk to you. Maybe you are strange too. You know what? If you want to visit, feel free to come by. If Papa Doc is not there. He may not know. - It remains our secret. There are two of them. Doing the dishes with a nun and have a secret. How is it going here? - Almost finished. Were you with the Air Force? Unfortunately. You were a good one been a parachutist. Don't you think so, sister? What is it? What have you done? - Nothing, Papa Doc. Affirmative. - What is it, sister? Something scared me. No wonder after today. She has to go to bed. Ralph, it's getting cold here. You would check the generator. Goddamnit. Repair the switch, stupid generator. Stupid generator? Who does such a thing? Bye, baby. A game? - I want to talk. I don't want to hear anything about it anymore your dad, that job and the house. I want to have fun. - It's something else. I have an idea. We take some of that expensive wine, what your dad is boasting about. There is soda and vodka. - But no wine. Again talks from Papa Doc. - No, the wine is in the cellar. The wine cellar. - That sounds interesting. Where are they now? - Swimming naked? Take your time, Harvey Beckman. You must save that. Yummy? Nice wine. - If Papa Doc caught you ... Then he likes it off my wages. Don't you think those children are strange? I can't say exactly. They don't behave like children. Smoking today children aged 10 already hash. They fuck at the age of 12. How can do they then become normal like us? Yet something is wrong. Did you see how crazy Susan is on fire? And how Hannah is staring at you. - With that white face. And that little soldier has an expensive watch. Where did he get that? - Stolen. Remember Hannah looked at you and said: What a healthy hair you have. - Nuns don't talk like that. Maybe there was no accident. Maybe they are lying. They certainly don't want to like to go home. Nice piece. Julie? Rick? - Yes, Lovely. So not naked swimming? You drink Papa Docs wine. - I was a little nervous. For this tranquilizer Doc charges $ 95. Can we talk, Lovely? About what? - Those children. What about that? - We find them strange. How much do you already have? - We mean it seriously. Do you know what your problem is? You spend too long with him. I already expected that. Unfortunately. Your queen goes there. Chess, and mat. Nice try. Maybe we will do it again. I put the pieces down. - Good night, Harvey Beckman. Where are your parents? I do not have. A six. Bedtime, Susan. - I'm staying with Mrs. Beckman. Reveille at seven o'clock. Give my die. Give up. - You didn't throw six. Specify if you will receive a blow. - I don't play with you anymore. They have teeth. What are those? - Piranhas. They eat your leg bald in twenty seconds. A nice story before bedtime. What do they get to eat? - Goldfish. A few dozen. Give you those babies to those ugly ones? Indeed. Do you want to feed them? Calm down. He doesn't do it. I have your job not necessary, Papa Doc. Stitch in it. Does he always talk to himself? Only in this way can he win the battle. Ruth? What is she doing here? - She's trying to sleep. I thought... We don't go out that often ... We are alone. The snow, the mountains. It is too late. I have a headache, a toothache, back pain and some more. Does an aspirin help? That water is ice cold. Lovely, what are you doing? I'm looking for Ralph. - You won't find him down there. If Papa Doc catches us, it only gets hot. He never caught us. - Once it's the first time. Lovely ... Lovely ... Stop. You like this, but I don't. Ralph, the heating and the light does not work. Ralph? The generator has failed. Good gracious. Why did he do that? - Did he do that? Could he come up with something like that? I'm calling the police. - The line has been broken. Let's take him to bring his room. You go to the village. I try start that generator. For the women... - We call it an accident. My God. Unbelieveable. Was it an accident? - No, I do not think so. I'm going to report it to the police. - It must be an accident. None of us did it. - Are you sure? What do you mean? - Maybe those children? You are kidding me. Think about it. Chalk on time. Does Ralph have family? - No, only us. Papa Doc took him out a home five years ago. He has lived here ever since. - Until today. The rotor is gone. Are you calling me? - Did David hit the car? Have you seen strangers? - No. That's fine. Are you back already? - The car's rotor is gone. I don't know what's going on, but we must consult. I call everyone together. - Is there someone upstairs? A rotor does not just disappear. - It's not the kids. There is something strange about David. Now you are mine Harvey Beckman. Murder is not a joke. I just thought: When will the advertisement come? Who does such a thing? - Dad Doc. Listen, drunk bitch ... - Leave her alone. Gladly. - I like you too. We have to get out of here. - How? There is three meters of snow and there is no telephone. What does it matter? Sorry. Do me too. If that is allowed. You heard me. Thanks. Cheers. A scythe. To mow grass. - You know everything too, don't you? He is not that smart. I have a plan. How so? - You don't know everything, do you see? Guns cannot run. - I can't find them anywhere. I want to show you something else. Do you lubricate butter with a spoon? - Not funny. Indeed. Where were you? There is no more wood. We're gonna chop some. I want that job in San Francisco. You heard me. I want to lead the sanatorium. - Oh yeah? Double my salary. And treat my wife with respect. Wait a second. - And now I'm going to chop wood. Because I want to. Where's my coat? Can i try it? Do you know how to do it, David? - Yes, it's easy. I put it down, you chop. That could be better. Go ahead. Come on, you chop like a girl. Put power behind it. If it does not work, Moe must help me. We call reinforcement, before you collapse. Succeeded. I turn it around for a moment. How did it happen? - He threw it at him. Who? - George did it. Where did he go? - I didn't dare look. He must leave here. - Don't tell anyone, okay? To Ralph's room. A weakling. A coward. I often cursed Harvey. But when he approached Papa Doc, I was so proud. You should have seen it. He was wonderful. - I heard him. I heard everything. I intended to leave him. A hundred times. I said I couldn't air it. Now he is no longer there. There is nothing left. Come down. I want to stay here. I'm sorry too. If we leave now, we have to we look behind every tree. The safest is now all stay in the same room. Fine. Read somewhere? - Do you know better? Always with your criticism. - Don't worry if you're scared. I am indeed scared. Just sit here, I'm taking a bath. If I don't relax, I don't make it in the morning. What do you do with my stuff? Why are you playing here? Answer. Don't hurt my baby. - Why did you do that? I didn't do anything. I hate you. - Get out. Get out. Don't kick, you hurt them. Go get everyone and come over here. This is better than nothing. - But who do we hit? Julie, hurry up. - Rick, Papa Doc, come here. What is it? - Lovely. It's those kids. Those damn kids. You bastards. Leave her alone. They have those guns. - Rick, stop it. Listen, Doc. Wait a second. Listen to me. Don't hurt them. I finish you all. Stop him, Rick. I finish you. I've got hold of the big bear. I told you it would work. - Thanks to my help. You have done nothing. Out of the way. They killed my father. Get that bucket, stupid head. Do you remember? I can wear both. Do I have to carry you too? Keep your mouth shut. Put those weapons down and I hit your lens. Don't wait, George. They are not going anywhere. Where's Susan? - She's outside. She needs you. It works. Susan? Susan, I don't understand. - She wants us for the court martial. To lock us up again. - We are not going back. You want to hurt me. You didn't love me. - Killer. Do it. Fire. Susan, don't. - Do it. I love you. We can't do anything for her. - They burn her. Is there another way out? Locked. We have to get out of here. - The boat. Here is another door. Hurry up. I could have killed him. - Forget it. My gun was stuck. The generator. Calm down. We are waiting here on the snow plow. Everything's gonna be fine, honey. I could have scared them. - I will. Don't bully her like that. Locked. We leave at dawn. I don't trust a snotty nose. - Have him shut up. Let's go eat at Ralph's. I hope he has more then peanut butter. Steak or chicken. We first have to eat something. - I'm drooling already. Honey? My face. Look at my beautiful face. - I'll kill you, asshole. You all. Do you hear me? Back to the snowman. Bats. You killed it. Brian? Who will be my husband? - Don't be silly. Checkmate, Harvey Beckman. Very unsporting, Harvey Beckman. I don't like it here anymore. The game is out. - We move on. Everything is better than these amateurs. - Time to go. It is ice cold outside. - We can't stay here. I don't want to leave, Julie. - Everything will be fine. We will find it again new toys. Promised? - Promised. I'm leading the way. - Bye, Lovely.
