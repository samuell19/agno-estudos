What do you want? I just wanted to thank you... Thank me? For what? It was two years ago, around this time... Two years? I was at college. You're a cab driver... Did you drive me somewhere? I wasn't a taxi driver then. I was your customer. My customer? Of what? I was wearing a black suit. I had a black case and dark glasses. You were a yellow sweater and a gray skirt... That wasn't me. You have the wrong girl. My name's not Yumi. What a day it's been! Oh, no! Hello. Hello? Hello. This is Tsuchiya. Why don't you get a life? What does that guy want? Does he want to blackmail me? Mura... Was it Murata? It's Muraki... This is for a scene at a Harajuku café. This will look good. That's the Spring/Summer collection. Thank you, sir. That color's nice. Manager Ota, we need you. Over to you, Miss Tsuchiya. Excuse me. Gorgeous. Mild Seven. Muraki speaking. A pick-up? I can be there in 20 minutes. Who? Tsuchiya? Miss Tsuchiya? That's me. To Shinjuku. - I'll use the expressway. - Whatever. I usually go by train. I remember now. Mr. Muraki, room 301. Why did you want to thank me? Never mind. Don't be like that. You sure you want to hear? Go ahead. My small publishing company went broke. I borrowed from the yakuza... I wanted to do something crazy before I killed myself. My ex-Wife was the only woman I'd ever slept with... I got drunk and went to a porn shop. I couldn't kill myself after What happened... What changed your mind? The expression on your face was like a mirror. - I had no idea... - It's over now. In any case, I don't see why you'd want to blackmail me. I wouldn't do that to you. Some men would. They run into you in the street and stalk you. They call me and then hang up. Not me! You're my angel. You see... I have a straight office job now, at a prestigious company. Some slimeball found out about me. He wants ¥100,000 a month to keep quiet. That's Why I was depressed. Is he a yakuza? I guess so. By the way, did I leave my earring in your cab? An earring? It's star-shaped. Well... I'll call and ask my partner once we're off the expressway. Forget it. You give up too easily. Try harder! Take me out for a French meal some time. After all, I'm your guardian angel. I'd love to. I'll call you. What? What's so funny? Hey. Do I look like an angel? You, an angel? What kind? You wouldn't understand. Scotch with hot water? Did some guy call you that? Someone from work? An angel! Sounds good, doesn't it? I couldn't find your earring at my place. You sure you lost it? It's because you're so mean to me! You made me leave before I could look for it. What's this about an angel? I'm an angel because I saved someone's life. - Did you look under the bed? - I looked everywhere. All I found was one of your pubic hairs. Oh, you asshole! Nami, can you find my boxer shorts? Tell me... Where did you save his life? Down here? Let me guess, you're jealous! You slept with him? Why do you think so? He asked me out though. That would be right! That's all men want from you. Hey. Who do you think I am? Hey! - OK, drink up! - Cheers. Who is he? Forget about him! You've got your own worries: If she finds my earring, she'll get suspicious. You got me worried. I'll look for it again. It's all a blur after ¥4 million. Before I knew it, I had a 30 million debt! That's scary! It sure is. Self-employment is hell. Marry a man with a steady job. Where's your man today? There's no one. You're wasting your precious day off. Not at all. I owe you a French dinner. Is it a valuable earring? Yes. - What's this? - Oh... Well... You know that song on the radio... It's on this album. You mean... This is for me? Did I please you that night? I... I don't remember anything because I fainted. Did you fuck me? Well I... Oh... You didn't! Well I... It was terrible for me. You weren't there when I came to. I had to untie myself. I thought I'd die. Oh, I wish you'd had sex with me... How boring... We can finish what we started. What do you mean? Take me somewhere for a drink. What about the earring? Nevermind. How was it being a passenger in a taxi? The driver was unpleasant. Don't be mean! Let me walk you to your place. Forget it. My place is boring... Don't say that after we've come this far. Where is it? What's that? "Sort out your Winter clothes. "I'll come again." You'd normally ask... "What happened afterwards? "Is Yumi your real name? What's your name? "Where do you live and work?" I bet you think I'm still in that business. No, I don't... Or do you have another motive? That was my first and last time. - Sorry to keep you waiting. - No problem. You want three more of the same dress? Sorry, it was a last-minute decision. Why do you need three? We need a few extra ones for a rain scene. No umbrellas? The director had a sudden whim. I got it. How about this? Miss Tsuchiya? I was told I'd find you here. I'm Manager Ota's wife. "Why don't you get a life?" Now the joke's on you, slut! Here, you lost this. What's this about? Six months ago I had a private eye follow you around... I didn't want a scene, so I overlooked your affair. I have photos to prove it, too! How dare you come into my house, you thieving pussy! Put this on, come on! Isn't this yours? Come back here. Listen! Men just like to fool around with young women! You thought he loved you! You horny cat on heat, meow-meow-meow! How dare you! This is too much! Listen to me! You'll be old one day! Lines, age spots and gray hair... Hi, honey. Why are you here? I found this at home, so I brought it in. Pardon me. Pardon me, you left your earring at my house. It'll look good on your nose! Try it! Who is it? Asashi newspaper! Your payment's due. I have no cash! I'll stop the subscription. Come on. You owe us for past deliveries. Hello! Can I get the money now? Go away! Hello. It's me. What do you want? You know we're through. Don't call me anymore. How easy it is for you! What did you tell that hysterical bitch? That stealing cat... I'm not serious about her! Who paid for the hotels? Who booked the rooms? I booked a single room each time... I'd call you to... I'd call you to give you the room number. You'd come to the room without going through reception. You'd leave at around 1 am every time. I'd be alone in the hotel room thinking the Whole night. What am I? You had a good deal. You fucked me on your business account. You didn't want your wife to know. I never called you at home. Just like you told me. I knew... I knew our affair would go nowhere. You're married! I was just convenient for you, that's all! I've had enough of this stupid relationship! Let me tell you something. I have a lover. He's a sweetheart. A little too sweet... I'm probably too good for him. He's about the same age as you. He's in a different league from you. The way he thinks... He treats me like a woman. I really do love this man. I put you first because I've known you longer. But today I finally saw you for what you are. Go ahead and make outwith that bitch in your nice condo! Don't worry, I have him now. He calls me an angel. You get it? I knew you wouldn't understand. You don't know I'm an angel. That I'm a good girl... You'll catch a cold. Oh, no... I dozed off. Anything wrong? I owe you an apology for the other day. Come on. Let's go inside. Come on in. I'll make you some hot tea. Sorry for just turning up. I had to see you. Warm up under the heater table. Go ahead. You want tea or coffee? I want this. With hot water? Sorry to be so demanding. It was freezing outside. Are you OK? I'm so tired... I feel old. Come on. You're young... Take some cold medicine. Can you help me drink it? My fingers are numb. Take off my sweater... it's the one I wore back then. Let's finish What we started. Force me to do it! You said you owed me. You said you'd do anything for me. I did, but... Let's do it, then. I forgot what I did. You handcuffed me. Just so you wouldn't... Use this to tie me up. Don't worry about how you did it. Just do it! This is wrong! You were rougher. Come on! What's wrong? Didn't you want this? Isn't this Why you looked for me? I... well... Do it if that's What you want! Maybe... not like this. Is it because we're here? Does it have to be at the hotel? - We'll go there! - No. It's okay like this... sorry. What's wrong? Tell me what's wrong! Everything about you is a lie! You just wanted to fool with a girl! You think I'm just a Whore? You don't know how I feel about you. Some angel I am! To hell with saving your life! While you had fun with me, I've been blackmailed! I got fired from my company! You were fired? Yes... Yes, I was fired. Now my secret's out. Aren't you man enough to get my photos back? I visited the condominium... The Milky Way Club wasn't there... They change names all the time! They use the name Ota as a cover for their business. This is a bad joke. It was a mistake to work for that club. It's my dirty secret... and only you know about it! Sorry... I'm hopeless. I shouldn't let such a small thing bother me. If we could start over... If we'd met differently... I wouldn't have an attitude. Call me any time, I'll be at your service. I'm so silly. Good night. Don't sleep at the tablel You'll catch a cold. Why are you here? Did you have company? A colleague. Why did you come? It's daytime. So they can find me. We can work and pay off the debt together. What? What's going on? We're divorced, so... You think you're doing me a favor? It's me. I'll see you at the hotel at 10 tonight. See you. I'm here about Tsuchiya Yumi. Oh, the private eye. Just a minute. I thought it was over. My husband is at home, so... Be quiet! Who are you? Give me anything you have on Tsuchiya Yumi! I have nothing! Documents, photos, anything! Now! Be quiet, it's late! Who the hell are you? The gentleman wants... Miss Tsuchiya's papers. That bitch sent you! We all make mistakes, but we have our reasons. It can't be helped! You have no right to blackmail her for what she did! Come on, quickly! Honey, help! I can look by myself and kill you both! Give him what he wants! Is this everything? Yes, it is. I have no connection with the woman in this photo... Oh, What am I saying... Have a good evening. Honey, activate the security alarm! No police! Everybody in the condo will find out! Calm down! Who is it? It's Yumi. Good evening. Come in. They redid the interior. Money in advance, right? Never mind. You gave me enough the last time. I really appreciated that. Call the agency. I don't need to, as you're my private client. I bought these... It was embarassing but... Get undressed! Hands out. I won't cuff you tonight. I'm Nami. Call me Nami. It's not Yumi. I was Yumi only on that night. Call me Nami. Go on. Please. Nami! Please... stay inside. Come to my place tomorrow. I'll cook for you. Thank you... But I have to work. How about the next day? I think the cold medicine is working... I feel kind of dizzy and nice... You went through a lot... Are you cold? You're so warm...
