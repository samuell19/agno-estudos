Did your mom find any work yet? No, there's not a whole lot out there right now, so I think she's pretty much just stopped looking. Is she... She's still on unemployment though, right? No, that ran out a while ago. So, then you're, you're just footin' the bill for everything? No, we... we still get stamps and everything. No, but, you know... - Maybelle. - You know what I mean. Yeah. It's all right though. She just needs a little help right now, that's all. Okay. Sometimes, I feel like I ought to smack - some sense into that woman. - Maybelle. You don't really mean that. Actually, I do. Oh. I'm... I'm sorry. Want me to wash your apron for you? - Please. - Okay. Hey. - Okay. - Okay. Okay. Bye, Dale. Bruno. Give me a hand. Hello, Mr. Daniels. Oh, hi, Katie. - Getting gas? - Yeah. You want a ride? Yeah, sure. Gotta make it quick though. I'm already running late. Sure. Can I ask you something? What? You think I should get my GED? 'Cause I've been thinking that... You're a waitress. So, it doesn't matter. How much do I owe you? Uh, how does eleven sound? Uh, I only have nine. Nine's great. Thanks. - Thank you, Mr. Daniels. - You're welcome. Momma? Yeah? Do you believe in love at first sight? No. I do. You remember to give Mr. Willard the rent? Mm-hm. How do I look? You're beautiful. - Yeah? - Yeah. Evening. Hey, go get him some food. Hi, baby. Hey. Thank you for this day, Daddy. I hope that I lived right today, and that if you could see me one day, I'd make you proud. Good night. There you go. So, who's the new guy? Bruno? Yeah, where he'd come from? Why? You got a thing for him? I don't know. Maybe. Where's your friend? I... I don't know. I... think he just got out of prison in Phoenix or something. You gonna fuck him? I meant, I don't know. I don't even know him. Yeah. Yeah, I bet you'll fuck him all right. We going for a ride? - Stop. - What? - Katie. - Coming. A little peace? So, what brought you here? What brought you to town? Oh, me? I... I've... I've been here all my life. Born and raised. So maybe you'd like to go out one time? Maybe you'd like to... take me out to dinner one time? You know, maybe you'd like to go on a date? Hi. Hello. Yeah! You shouldn't be hangin' around here. Come on. You know that. Willy's dad's in there with your mom. Well, now, that's none of our business, is it? What're you doing? I was gonna try and jump through my window, but I guess I locked the darn thing. You know we were all made by those sounds? Sounds kind of funny though, doesn't it? Yeah. Yeah. You just gotta be patient, Momma. That's all. Some guy's bound to come along and gonna sweep you off your feet. Take you out to Reno and buy you a house like you've always wanted. - Doesn't work like that. - Yeah, it does. Willy, you believe in love? Yeah. Good. You ever been in love? No. I don't know. Well, you will. What in the hell are you doing? We were out celebrating, Rosa. I got a date tomorrow. Well, I don't want my boy hangin' around either one of you. The last thing I need is for him to turn on me, too. You should be grateful. My daughter just bought your son a meal. I'll be grateful when you stop fucking my man. Then try doing it yourself. Momma. What the fuck do you think you're doing? Good night, Willy. Willie, get that little fuckin' ass over here! Night, Rosa. Right now! - Is he cute? - Heck yeah, he's cute. He's the cutest man I've ever seen. - There ya go, doll. - Thank you. Katie, could you... Of course, Steve. Can you wait about two hours? - Yeah. - Okay. Has he got a smile? I don't know. I bet he does. I bet he's got the most handsome smile I've ever seen. Well, be careful of a man that's got a smile. You can't trust 'em. I'm pretty sure I can trust him. No, I'm telling you. You gotta find yourself a man with sad eyes. A sad man you can mold and treat you right, but a man who's got a smile you can't do nothing with. Come on, boss. They will leave you with a heart full of hurt. Hey, Bruno. Is this your car? No. Uh, I'm working on it. I haven't ever been in a convertible before. I have a motorcycle. Well, I've never been on a motorcycle either. Isn't this amazing? - What? - Isn't this amazing? Oh, yeah. So, you're from Phoenix? Tempe. I've never been. Is it nice? It's all right, yeah. Thanks for the milkshake. Yeah, you're welcome. You wanna go see my favorite place? Sure. Can I ask you a question? Yeah. Do you smile much? What do you mean? I don't know, I mean... do you smile much? No, I guess not. Is that all right? Yeah. Of course, I'll... I'll smile enough for the both of us. Okay. You ever seen the ocean? No. I've only been out of Arizona once. Where'd you go? New Mexico. You ever drink Regent's Light? My momma always drinks those. Yeah. They're all right. I've never had a beer. You think you could live in California? I don't know. I guess. Figure I could live anywhere. Doesn't matter much either way. I've always wanted to bring someone here. It's perfect. You're perfect, Bruno. Thank you, Bruno. Tonight was really special. Yeah. You wanna pick me up from work tomorrow? Okay. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Thank you. I got it. So you got a date for prom? No. Not yet. I might not even go. Why? 'Cause nobody's asked me. Someone's gonna ask you. You're so smart and pretty. I'd ask you if I could. That's just weird. No, it's not. Ah, there's Bruno. Bye. What are we doing? Picking up beer. Okay. I'll wait here for you. Hey. Not today. I'm on a date with my boyfriend. All right. This is Bruno. That's a hell of a ride you got. I'll see you around. All right. Give my regards to your mother. Sure. Bruno's a mechanic over at Bud's. Right now, he's fixing up this beautiful old convertible. It's amazing, and he's doing a really great job at it. Cheers. I'm really happy you two could meet and that we're all here together. It means a lot to me. Cheers. Bon app√©tit. You know what that means? It's French. Can I ask you something? Yeah. Were you in prison? Who told you that? Matty. Yeah. What for? Grand theft auto. Like stealing cars and stuff? Mm-hm. So you never hurt anyone? No. I never hurt anyone. How's your momma doing? She's doing good. Seems to be getting better at least. Yeah? Oh, I'm so happy to hear that. That's such good news. Yeah, um, I could... give you a ride home and you could see her then, if you'd like. I would love to, Matty, but I've got a date with Bruno today. Um... Do you mind giving this to him? It's just something small for his lunch. - Sure. - Thanks, Matty. Hey, gorgeous. Hello. Um, the usual? - Yes, please. - Okay. I'm happy for you, Katie. This feeling you've got... That's what life's all about. Yeah. It feels nice. I haven't ever had this before. I know you haven't. Got any brothers or sisters? I don't think so. Yeah, I don't think I do either. You know what you wanna do in life? Not really. I'm just trying to... stay out of trouble. Hm. That's a good goal. I wanna be a beautician. I wanna... cut people's hair and stuff. It's nothing fancy like being a doctor or, or anything, but... I figure it's just as good as anything else. It seems like not a whole lot of people are happy, so... if I can do something to make them feel good about themselves, then... then they'd be happier, you know? When you think about it, it's just as important as anything else. I just think people need to learn to appreciate things more. 'Cause if you look at it in a certain way, life is just so amazing. Bruno? I've been saving up my money for a really long time, and I'm gonna move out to San Francisco. Okay. And I want you to move out there too. I want us to leave together. I love you, Bruno. You do? Why? 'Cause I see something in you I haven't ever seen before. Thank you for this day. I hope that I lived right today, and that if you could see me one day, I'd make you proud. Good night, Daddy. I'm so, so happy right now. I'm sorry. Did I wake you? What are you doing? I always say good night to my dad before going to bed. Where is he? I don't know. My momma says he died in a mining accident, but I know it's not true. How? Because if it was, I'd know it in my heart. Thank you for such a wonderful day. Might have been the best day of my life. Good night, Bruno. I love you. Katie. Hey, good morning, Mr. Willard. - How are you? - I'm fine. I'd be better if you paid me my rent, though. What? I didn't get my rent. There must've been a mistake. I already gave my momma the money. You didn't get anything? I didn't get nothing. Momma... All right. I... I'm sorry, Mr. Willard, uh... She must've forgotten or something. Forgot, my ass. Your mother probably pocketed that money for god knows what. Can I just give you half right now and then another half at the end of the week? - I get paid on Friday. - That's fine. But this is the last time. I know. I promise. - Give me one minute. - All right. I'm getting sick and tired of doing this shit every month. I know, Mr. Willard. I'm really sorry. What in the hell is going on? Mr. Willard needs the rent. What? Jesus Christ, Katie. - Momma, don't touch that. - Where'd you get all that money? You can't keep doing this. You're gonna get us kicked out of here. Bill just needed to borrow it for a couple of days. He's late in paying us back, all right? Well, that's fine, but you just gotta let me know, okay? Don't get mad at me. We're gonna get it back, baby. This is the first hundred. You'll get the rest by the end of the week. This happens next time, you're out, you hear? You know, things are tough right now. Well, goddamn it, things are tough for everyone right now, Tracey. You think I'm living nice right now? No, I'm not. All right. Goodbye, Momma. Sorry I'm late, Maybelle. Everything all right? Yeah. Everything's fine. - Hey, Darrel. - Hey. You've seen my apron? Oh, I washed it for you last night. Here you go. Thank you. You think I could pick up a double today? Did your mother take the rent again? Yeah, but it's fine. I'll just pick up some doubles to make up for it. Katie, I swear. Maybelle, it's fine. It's all right. Good morning, officer. - Morning. - Good morning. So can I? Sure. I'm sure Sara'd appreciate the night off. Thank you. Well, now look who it is. Hey, I'm just stopping by to give Bruno his lunch. Bring anything for me? No. I'm sorry. You did fuck him, huh? Now, how come I can't even get you to blow me and yet you'll fuck some dumb idiot, huh? I don't think that's fair, do you? Hm? What're you doing? Just catching up. You touch her like that again, I'll knock your fucking teeth out. Hey, don't let him get to you. I brought you something to eat. I gotta work a double tonight so I'm gonna be late coming back. I'll just stop by yours when I'm done. Yeah. Okay. Bye, baby. Bye, Dirk. She making you pay for it? What? You heard me. You ever threaten me again, your ass goes back to jail. Hi, Mr. Daniels. Hi. Is Sara here? No. She had the night off. Didn't she let you know? No. Well, do you need a ride? - Yeah, I'd love one, actually. - All right. Okay. Okay. Good night, boss. Katie. Be smart now. Thank you again for the ride. I really appreciate it. Sure. Where are you going? I figured we would catch up, all right? Oh, I can't tonight, Mr. Daniels. I'm already really late. Oh, it won't take that long. No, I wish I could, but I don't even know if Bruno's eaten or anything. I'll give you twenty dollars. Plus the two that I owe you from before. I can't, Mr. Daniels. I'm sorry. Katie. I'm not gonna take you home until we do this. So, let's stop wasting each other's time and get started. I don't have a condom. Well, I do. Now unbutton your top. That's it. That's a good girl. Sara, isn't that your dad's car? - Oh, shit! - What? - What is it? - Get out. Now, get the fuck out! Dad? What are you doing here? What's going on? Katie, what were you doing with my dad? What were you doing with my dad? Go home. Go home! Right now! Bruno? Bruno? It's me. It's Katie. Hey, baby. - You're late. - I know. I'm sorry. Close the fucking door. You're gonna let the spiders in. Fuck. Don't look at me. I don't want you to look at me. - Thank you for this day, Daddy... - Katie. Sorry. I have to work in the morning. I know. I'm sorry. Don't touch me. Bruno, what's wrong? Are you a whore? - What? - Are you a whore? What do you mean? I mean, do you fuck men for money? Yeah. Why? Things have just been tough for my mom and me. I can stop if you want me to. Do you want me to stop? Yeah. Yeah, I want you to stop. Okay, Bruno. I won't ever do that again. I'm sorry, I didn't think it meant anything. It doesn't. I promise I won't ever do that again. Be quiet. Please don't touch me. Okay. Good night, Bruno. I love you. Can we talk for a second? Yeah. What do you do when you and Darrel get in a fight? Nothing. We've been married so long we're always in a fight. Well, what are you supposed to do when you wanna make a man happy? Are you and that mechanic already going at it? No, not really. But... I upset him and I wanna make it up to him. Well, whenever you're... in a situation, wondering - what to do with a man, - Mm-hm. you think about what a woman would want, and then you do the opposite. More like hot and cold? Things like that? Yeah. Exactly. Okay, like... if you were mad, what would you want? What? I don't know. You, you would wanna go out to dinner, right? Yeah. That would be nice. So then, you know, he's gonna want you to make him dinner. - Mm-hm. - Okay? And you might want something fancy, like you would want... lobster or... a bottle of wine and some candlelight. I don't know. I've never had lobster. So, you know he's gonna want steak, beer under fluorescent lighting. And... you'd wanna talk, - right? - Yeah. - So what does that mean? - He's not gonna want to talk. No. He's gonna wanna watch TV. - Okay. - Okay. And then, at the end of the night... you'd wanna make love. You know, something... - real sweet that would bring - Mm-hm. the two of you close together. Yeah. So you know he's gonna wanna fuck. My god. Do you see how easy that is? Yeah. Okay. Mm-hm. Always remember that men are simple, Katie. They always have been. Thank you, Maybelle. Of course. Bear? Yeah, baby? I can't do it anymore. I know you can't. I promised Bruno I wouldn't. I think that's probably the right call to make. Yeah. So what's the story about San Francisco? Well, I've almost got everything saved up for my mamma and me, so it's looking like I can leave pretty soon. I thought your momma was gonna stay? Yeah, she is. But I just need to leave her some money so she's all right. Figure out what you're gonna do for work? Yeah. I'm gonna go to beauty school. - You are? - Yeah. Well, I'm gonna have to get a job waiting tables or something, but I'm gonna learn how to cut hair. It's nothing fancy like being a lawyer or anything, but I figure it's something I might be good at. No, don't say that, Katie. We've all got our place in the world. Yeah, I know. You're not mad at me or anything? Mad? Hell no. Sweetie, I'm proud of you. Yeah? Yeah. Thank you. You're welcome. You know I'll always be there for you. I know. I should go now. Maybelle's probably expecting me. Yeah, all right. Oh, no. Lunch is on me, Bear. Oh, no, it is not. - No, it is. It's my treat. - Listen to me. I ain't got no one in the world to care for but myself. So, you take this money and let me feel like I'm doing someone some good. All right? Okay. - Thank you, Bear. - You're welcome. - And, hey, Katie. - Yeah? You stay sweet, now. Yeah. I will. Sara, what are... what are you doing? You can't... My dad told me everything. Why would you try to seduce him like that, huh? You think he would wanna have sex with you? He's married. He has kids. - He was your teacher. - I'm sorry. I don't care if you're sorry. You're sick. You're sick, and there's something seriously wrong with you. I'm sorry, but that's Maybelle's and you can't... So then replace it. Who do you think she'll believe? Me, or some dumb slut poorer than shit? Everything all right? Are you happy, Bruno? Yeah. What kind of question is that? I don't know. Just seeing if he was happy, that's all. Are you happy, Momma? No. I'm not. But I figure I wasn't meant to be. You think you could fix that car outside? - Probably. - That's a great idea, Momma. Bruno can definitely fix it. All right then. Did you fuck anyone today? No, Bruno. I told you I wasn't doing that anymore. I meant that. Do you want me to turn around so you don't have to see my face? No. It's all right. Thank you. Pick me up after work? Yeah. See you later, baby. Have a good day. So did it work? Yup. And he said he was happy, too. I told you so, doll. I know you did. - And guess what? - What? We didn't fuck. We made love. You ready to fix that car? All right. Let me get my tools. You're getting more play than I thought, big boy. You want a ride today? Oh, no, thanks. I've got plans with Bruno. Thank you though. I think Bruno's plans might've changed. Why? What's he doing? Your momma came by the shop today. Yeah, I know. He's fixing the car. You two like to keep it in the family? Excuse me? Ignore him, Katie. He doesn't know what he's talking about. Come on inside. We'll let it run for a bit. Looks like your momma's car was busted up pretty bad. I don't know what's taking so long. Well, maybe he didn't have the right tools for the job. You want a ride? Yeah, you want a ride? - You want a beer? - No. Katie, you wanna drink? No, thanks. Thanks though. You work it sober, huh? I respect that. Hey, I'm just giving you shit. Turn up here. What? Why? Turn here. I wanna show Katie something. I need to get back, Matty. Bruno's probably expecting me... Hey, it ain't gonna take long. - Maybe... - Quit being a fucking pussy. It's fine, Katie. It won't take long. What's out here? It's a surprise. Something special. Pull over right here. Let's go, you love birds. Move. We're gonna have ourselves a party. Katie, get your ass out of the car. Let's go. Let's not stay here too long, okay? Katie, I don't think you're in control right now. That's not your call to make. Turn the radio up. Katie and I wanna dance. Don't we, sweetheart? No. no, I'm okay... - Every girl likes to dance. - Yeah, but not right now. Tell me something, Katie. Hm? How come the town's slut's fucked half the guys around here but she hasn't ever given me or Matty a taste? I'm talking about you, sweetheart. - Leave her alone, Dirk. - Shut up. Hm? I don't know. Well, we've got needs too, you know. Yeah. I know. And now you're fucking that lame... ex-con that's just about mute. Why's that? Because I love him. I'm sure you do. Come over here. Come on. Let's just get out of here. Hey, we're not, shut up. We're not going anywhere. - Can we go? I don't feel good. - Hey! Shut the fuck up! We're not going anywhere. We're gonna stay right here, and we'll have ourselves some fun, okay? You know, change the radio station. None of that hillbilly shit you like, all right? Let's play something good. I wanna show Katie something. Katie, get your ass over here. You promise you're not gonna hurt me? Uh... Yeah. Of course. Hey. I ain't going to hurt you, okay? I promise. Here, I just wanna show you something. - What is it? - Okay. Don't just stand there, grab the beer. Hey, it's all right. You have a good day at work today? Get a lot of tips? Got big tips? All right, here we go. Got a name tag. - Please, Dirk. - Shut the fuck up! Get in the goddamn car. - Here you go. - No, what are you doing? - Taste a little bit. - I don't want to. Hey, hey, hey. You want beer? - No, I just wanna go home. - Yeah, but we're not going home. - No, no! Don't! Stop, please! - I don't wanna do this, okay? - Hey, shut the fuck up, Matty. - Matty, please stop... - It's what you always wanted. - No, please. - We're not going home. - You promised. You promised you wouldn't hurt me! Fuck! Fucking bitch! Fuck! - Don't hit her! - Fucking scratched me. Shut the fuck up, Matty! Please, please. Matty, please. Get off! No! No, please. No! Help! No! - It's all right, Katie. - That's good. - No. - That's good. That's good. - It's gonna be all right, okay? - No, Matty! Shut up! - There we go. - No. No. - Yeah, yeah. - No, no. - Matty, please get him off me! - Oh, shut up! That's good. That's good. Oh, god! - Come on, come on. - Help! Come on, come on, oh! No! Oh, god! Yeah. Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Uh. Attagirl. Attagirl. Whoo! - She's all yours, pal. - No. No. God. Dirk, I don't wanna... Quit being a fucking faggot and fuck her, all right? She's here now. Whoo. Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy. It's okay, you can stay right there. It's okay. - Matty, please. - Hey. You do it or I'll take her again. No. No! All right? Let's go. - Here you go. - No, Matty. No! - It's all right, Katie. - No! - No! - It's all right, okay? - It's, it's gonna be over soon. - No! So, um... How much do we owe you? Nothing. You don't owe me anything. You hear that, Matty? Look, it's good, man. It's on the house, huh? It's good, man, it's good. Promise you won't tell anyone? I don't want my momma to find out. It wouldn't be good for her. Yeah. I promise. Thanks, Katie. You're welcome. I'm sorry, Katie. Katie... I need you to do my makeup. I'm actually not feeling too good right now. What's wrong? Nothing. I just... had a long day at work. Well, Bill's coming over. I need to look good. Okay, just... Just give me a minute. I, I just need a minute. Don't move. What happened to your eye? Nothing. Doesn't look like nothing. Well, it was. Katie? Yeah? I'm sorry I haven't been a very good mother. I think I'm just not a very good person. You're doing your best, and... that's what's important. Yeah. How do I look? You look beautiful. You always do. Thank you. You're welcome. Bruno, are you there? It's me. It's Katie. Bruno... Bruno, where were you today? I waited for you at the diner, but you never came. Is everything all right? All right. I hope I can see you tomorrow. I hope I can see you tomorrow and that you have a good day. Good night, Bruno. I love you. Hey, baby. Come here a sec. What happened to your eye? Nothing. Is that from Bruno? Mm-mm. No. Is it from one of these guys in here? Maybelle, really, it's nothing. - Is it your momma? - No. - Are you sure? - Yeah. You know you can tell me, right? Oh, my god, Katie. Don't ever put up with anyone hitting you. - You hear me? - Yeah. You are too smart for that. I know. I know you know, but I just... Oh, man. I just can't help but worry about you. Well, you don't have to worry about me, boss. I'll be fine. - Get back to work, okay? - Okay. Of course, she didn't charge us. Did you hear the way she was moaning? She fucking loved it. Hey, uh, you think she ever makes Bruno pay for it? I know that Indian hasn't even fucked her like that. What'd you say? I said it looks like you aren't the only one getting it on the house. Hi, Sara. Shut up, Katie. Hey, Bruno. Where you going? Where you going? Hello, gorgeous. Hey, Bear. You want the usual? Yeah. What in the hell happened to you? Uh, it's nothing, Bear. It was an accident, that's all. Don't look like no accident. Katie. Can I talk to you? - Bruno, what are you doing here? - Is this him? - Katie. - Did you do that to her? Bear, not in here! I asked you a question! - Did you do that to her? - No! Stop it! - Shut up! - Don't do that in here! - Stop it! - Bruno! Bear? You better not hurt her! I'm calling the police, you piece of shit! Darrel, call the police. You fucked them! You fucked them, and you said that you weren't going to! Bruno, I meant what I said. - Then why did you fucking do it? - I didn't want to! - I didn't want to! - But you did! You did! And now I'm fucked because of you! Bruno, what are we doing here? Bruno, let's just go home. How much do I owe you? What? How much do I owe you? You don't owe me anything. Is thirty fair? Bruno, I don't want your money. That's not what this is. Thirty-six. That's tip for coming inside. Bruno, why are you doing this? I thought you love me. How would I love you? How? - I love you. - No, you don't. - Yeah, I do. - No, you don't. You're a whore, Katie. You're not meant to be loved. You find your own way back, all right? Katie? Hello, Mr. Willard. I need that rent. I know. I'll get it to you later today. Momma? Momma? Mom? Oh, Momma. Your mother told me you wouldn't have it. So, I was thinking that me and you, maybe me and you could work out another arrangement. Your mother ran off with my man. - Uh, Katie, you can't walk away - I know. from me like that. Your family ain't nothing but fucking trash. We're all trash, Rosa. Goddamn it, Katie. Now you listen to me, girl. You all owe me for the last month. Then take the TV. I don't want the TV. I already got two. So then have three. What am I supposed to do now? I don't know, Rosa. You're gonna have to figure it out. Sheriff just picked up that boyfriend of yours. Caught him out on 89 in a stolen vehicle. You like a ride? No, thanks. Come on. It'll be quick. No. I'm not doing that anymore. What? I said I'm not doing that anymore. Fine then. Suit yourself. Oh, my god. - Are you all right? - I'm fine. I'm really sorry about what happened. It's fine. It's fine. Is... Is Bear okay? He's... a little bruised up is all. - He didn't hurt you, did he? - No. He didn't hurt me. Do you mind if I work tonight? You don't have to pay me. I'll just work for tips. Oh... I just... Actually, I need to talk to you. Could... could you just give us a second, Sara? What is it, boss? Um...
