IF HE GOES ON LIKE THAT, WE'LL HAVE THE PADRE IN NEXT THINKING HE'S GOT A NEW CUSTOMER. HE CAN'T TAKE THAT HILL. STEVENS. STEVENS. I CAN'T DO ANY MARCH. I JUST WANT TO-- I JUST WANT TO LAY DOWN. ROBERTS, IF HE GOES SICK, HE GOES ON SICK PARADE. YOU GET A SCREW'S PERMISSION TO BED HIM DOWN. YOU'RE NOT DROPPING US IN IT AGAIN. THAT'S RIGHT. STAFF! STAFF, WE GOT A SICK MAN IN HERE! ALL RIGHT. THAT'S ENOUGH. WILLIAMS HAD HIM ON THE HILL. YOU GET THE VET. STAFF, I WANT OUT FROM THESE LUNATICS, STAFF. BED THE LAD DOWN, ROBERTS. YOU WANT SOMETHING, STAFF? YES. I'D LIKE A WORD WITH YOU. THIS IS MY CELL. I'M RESPONSIBLE HERE. I'M NOT, THANK GOD. THEN LEAVE IT TO ME. YOU'VE GOT A SICK MAN IN HERE. I CAN DEAL WITH IT. I'VE GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS TO BED HIM DOWN. IF YOU DON'T GET OUT SHARP, STAFF, I'LL PUT YOU ON REPORT AND LET THE R.S.M. DECIDE WHAT'S RIGHT OR NOT. I CAN ORGANIZE A VISIT FROM THE M.O., SEE WHAT HE SAYS. McGRATH, WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM? I'M NOT A VET, STAFF. RIGHT, GET YOUR TOWELS. YOU'VE ALL HAD A BUSY TIME, SO I'M PUTTING YOU UNDER THE SHOWERS TO SWEETEN YOU UP AND SMARTEN YOU UP. WE'RE TAKING STEVENS WITH US. YES, STAFF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED, STAFF. GET HIM ON HIS FEET. GET HIM UP, BARTLETT. YES, STAFF. COME ON. STAFF WANTS YOU UP. OH, NO. STAFF WANTS YOU UPSY-DAISY! ON YOUR FEET! HE'S IN NO FIT STATE TO WALK.

I'LL GET THE PREACHER IN TO YOU TWO AND GET YOU MARRIED. ALL RIGHT, DOUBLE OUTSIDE. OUTSIDE. DRAG THAT FAIRY OUT. IF I'D KNOWN YOU WERE ON YOUR HONEYMOON, I'D HAVE HAD YOU IN A SEPARATE CELL. I DON'T HOLD WITH ONE OF MY STAFF COMPLAINING ABOUT A BROTHER OFFICER. LISTEN, IF WILLIAMS CRIPPLES STEVENS, YOU'LL TAKE THE CAN BACK, NOT WILLIAMS. YOU'RE TELLING ME AGAIN HOW TO RUN THIS PLACE? IF I HEAR ANY MORE COMPLAINTS OUT OF YOU, I'LL HAVE YOU POSTED. SIR, I SUGGEST YOU LET THE M.O. DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT STEVENS IS FIT FOR PUNISHMENT. I MAKE THE DECISIONS. ME. I'LL SEE IF HE'S FIT OR NOT. NOW GET OUT! TIME IS UP! HEY, NOT THAT ONE. WHAT? THAT TURNS ON THE GAS. [LAUGHTER] QUIET! WHAT'S THIS I HEAR ABOUT STEVENS, MR. WILSON? NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT, SIR. WELL, STAFF HARRIS TOLD ME. HARRIS, HE'S LIKE A DREAM WALKING. IF STEVENS WERE SICK, HE'D BE HERE, WOULDN'T HE, SIR? YES, I SUPPOSE SO. WELL, SINCE I'M HERE, I'D BETTER SEE HIM. THINK I DON'T KNOW MY JOB, SIR? THINK I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON? I NEVER SAID THAT. I KNOW WHAT STAFF WILLIAMS IS DOING. STAFF HARRIS TOLD ME-- HARRIS, HMM? HE'S SAND HAPPY. I'M STILL IN CHARGE HERE, SIR. I WANT TO SEE STEVENS. YOU'VE SEEN HIM, SIR. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU PASSED HIM FIT, FIT FOR DUTY AND PUNISHMENT. THE HILL, SERGEANT MAJOR. IF ONE OF THE STAFF OVERDOES THE GOOD WORK... I CAN TAKE IT, SIR. ANY FIT MAN CAN TAKE IT, SIR. YES, WELL, AS YOU SAY, IF HE WAS SICK, HE'D BE HERE, WOULDN'T HE? YES. YES. GOD, IT'S HOT. IT'S LIKE AN OVEN IN HERE. [KNOCK ON DOOR] LIGHTS OUT, FIVE MINUTES. STILL NO SIGN OF THE M.O., EH? LIGHTS OUT, FIVE MINUTES. LIGHTS OUT, FIVE MINUTES. HE LOOKS BETTER. YEAH. MAYBE HARRIS WILL GET THE VET TOMORROW. IT'S A LAUGH. WHAT IS? ALL WE EVER GET IN THIS DUMP IS MEDICINE AND DUTY. ONE LUNATIC, YOU KNOW, IN CENEFFIA, THAT WAS A RIGHT NICK, THAT WAS. HE MADE HIS BLANKETS UP INTO A KIND OF A NEST, YOU SEE. AND HE SAT THERE ALL NIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THEM GOING, "CUCKOO, CUCKOO" ALL NIGHT LONG. HE WAS TRYING TO WORK HIS TICKET. NO. HE WAS ROUND THE BEND. HE'D BEEN FRIGHTENED BY AN HAND GRENADE, I THINK. ANYWAY, THE SCREW GOT THE VET IN, YOU SEE, AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE VET RECOMMENDED? MEDICINE AND DUTY. ANYWAY, THE VET HAD A BRIGHT IDEA, YOU SEE. HE SORT OF FANCIED HIMSELF A BIT OF A TRICK CYCLIST, AND HE PUT THIS DUMMY HAND GRENADE INTO THE NEST WITH THE CUCKOO. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE CUCKOO DONE? TRIED TO HATCH IT OUT. YOU'VE HEARD IT. ANYWAY, YOU GOT TO LAUGH BECAUSE SOME OF THESE SCREWS ARE COMICS. I MEAN, TAKE WILLIAMS. THERE'S STEVENS THERE ON HIS CHIN STRAP. ALL WILLIAMS CAN THINK OF DOING IS GIVING HIM THE OLD "ATTENTION! "ABOUT TURN! DOUBLE MARCH!" HE'S OFF. I WONDER IF HE COULD HATCH OUT A PACKET OF PLAYERS FOR MONTY BARTLETT. HERE, STEVENS, STICK AT IT, KIDDO. YOU'RE A CERT FOR YOUR TICKET, YOU ARE. BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM. KEEP THEM UP, BOY. KEEP THEM UP. [LAUGHTER] COME ON, BOY. BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM. [LAUGHTER] HE'S DEAD. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MEN WHISTLING AND CHEERING] THE M.O. WILL HAVE TO WRITE OUT A DEATH CERTIFICATE, WON'T HE? WHAT WILL HE DIAGNOSE, CARELESSNESS? WHAT'S THAT? CARELESS OF STEVENS TO DROP DEAD? A BIT LATE FOR YOUR JOKES, CHARLIE. WORD GOT AROUND YET? IT WILL, BERT. THERE MIGHT BE SOME TROUBLE. WE'D BETTER BE ON OUR TOES. I'D LIKE TO MAKE A SUGGESTION. YES? MOVE WILLIAMS OUT OF THE BLOCK. PUT HIM ON THE GATE WHERE HE CAN'T DO SO MUCH DAMAGE. THAT WOULD BE AS GOOD AS ADMITTING I THINK WILLIAMS KILLED THE LAD. BERT, I'D SOONER HAVE WILLIAMS DOUBLING IN HERE THAN ANYBODY. LISTEN. I ORDERED WILLIAMS TO SMARTEN UP THE PRISONERS IN CELL EIGHT. YES. WE ALL ACCEPT THAT. IF STEVENS WAS FIT, HE'D STILL BE HERE, WOULDN'T HE? THE ARMY JUDGED HIM A-1. THE M.O. PASSED HIM FIT FOR PUNISHMENT. LOOKS LIKE STEVENS WAS ONLY FIT TO DROP. IT'S NOT YOUR WORRY. IT'S THE M.O.'s. THANK YOU, BERT. YOU SAID YOU BACKED YOUR STAFF. WE AIN'T CELEBRATING A GLORIOUS VICTORY, WILLIAMS. WE'RE PATCHING UP A BLOODY DISASTER. YOU REALIZE I'LL HAVE TO MAKE A FULL REPORT. WE ALL WILL, SIR. HE WAS PERFECTLY FIT WHEN I EXAMINED HIM. WHEN YOU DID WHAT? WELL, WHEN I MADE-- WHEN I EXAMINED HIM. YOU ONLY LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND CHAIN. LOOK HERE, SERGEANT-- YOU PASSED HIM FIT, SO I HANDED HIM OVER TO STAFF WILLIAMS. HE WAS-- WELL, HE WAS KEPT OUT IN THE SUN TOO LONG. I CHECKED ON HIS RECORDS. BASE JOB IN AN OFFICE. WELL, ANYBODY COULD SEE THAT. SUDDENLY TO BE DRILLING FOR HOUR AFTER HOUR IN THE BLAZING SUNSHINE... WELL, IT WAS FATAL IN HIS CASE. SOUNDS LIKE ACCIDENTAL DEATH, SIR. YEAH. THE MAN WAS A-1. BUT TO COME FROM A BASE JOB TO THIS PLACE? YOU UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS BETTER THAN ME, SIR. ACCIDENTAL DEATH, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT, SIR. WELL, I HOPE SO. I'VE DENTED A FEW, SIR, BUT I'VE NEVER MURDERED ANY. I WASN'T REFERRING TO YOU. THAT GOES FOR MY STAFF, TOO, SIR. GOOD NIGHT, SIR. ACCIDENTAL DEATH. IF THERE'S ANOTHER ACCIDENTAL DEATH AND YOU'RE IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH IT, STAFF... WAITING TO FIND OUT WHAT WILLIAMS IS GOING TO PULL NEXT IS LIKE WAITING TO GO INTO ACTION. YOU KNOW THE FEELING? I'M THE FELLA WHO REFUSED TO GO IN. REMEMBER ME? YOU BEAT UP YOUR OFFICER BECAUSE HE ORDERED THE BOYS IN? YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. 'CAUSE HE ORDERED THE BOYS IN. WAS HE GOING IN HISSELF? NO... I TOOK THEM IN. RIGHT AWAY WE LOST HALF OUR TANKS, SO I PULLED THE BOYS OUT. I PUT THE MAJOR IN THE PICTURE, TOLD HIM THE SITUATION WAS HOPELESS. IF THE MINES DIDN'T GET US, JERRY'S ANTITANK GUNS WOULD. WHAT DID THE MAJOR SAY? GET BACK IN. HE WAS VERY CALM ABOUT IT. HE SAID THAT HE HAD HIS ORDERS. NEXT THING I KNEW, THE BOYS WERE PULLING ME OFF HIM. MAN, THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS ARMY GIVING YOU WRONG ORDERS. SOMEBODY GOT TO HAVE THE GUTS TO CANCEL SOME OF THEM DAMN WRONG ORDERS. THERE'D BE NO BLOODY ARMY LEFT IF WE DIDN'T OBEY ORDERS. JOE... YOU FEEL PRETTY BAD ABOUT THIS, HUH? LOOK, IT'S NOT JUST DISOBEYING ORDERS. IT'S RULES, REGULATIONS, ME. BUT, MAN, YOU SAVED ALL THEM BOYS FROM GETTING KILLED FOR NOTHING. THE TROOP SERGEANT TOOK THEM IN. I WAS PUT IN TO CLOSE THE RANKS. NONE OF THEM CAME BACK. BLOODY COCKROACHES. AS IF WE HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH TO SUFFER WITHOUT YOU TWO TALKING HALF THE NIGHT. CAN'T YOU LET A MAN SLEEP? YOU AIN'T BEEN SLEEPING MUCH YOURSELF, JOE. NO. ANOTHER STINKING HOT DAY. [SNORING] YOU CAN PRACTICALLY HEAR IT BOILING ALREADY. LOOK AT MONTY. FLAT OUT. WAKE UP! WHO DONE THAT? I DID. YOU WANT TO WATCH IT, MATE. YOU JUST WANT TO WATCH IT. [MOSQUITO BUZZING] SOMEBODY OUGHT TO WRITE TO THE M.P. ABOUT THIS DUMP. YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU? HIM? I BET HE CAN'T EVEN WRITE. WHAT'S SO CLEVER ABOUT BEING ABLE TO WRITE, THEN? THE SECRET IN THIS OLD WORLD, MATE, IS TO USE YOUR LOAF. MAYBE I CAN'T READ, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO KNOCKING OFF STUFF, I'M WAY OUT IN FRONT ON ME OWN. I'LL BET YOU ARE. YOU'RE A FAIR SAMPLE OF THE NO-TALENT CLASS. THIEVING THREE BOTTLES OF WHISKEY. BLIMEY. I DIDN'T THIEVE THEM, MAN. I DRANK THEM. BET HE CAN'T WRITE NEITHER. MONTY, JUST BECAUSE I'M BLACK, DO I HAVE TO BE DAMN IGNORANT, TOO? YOU BLACKS AIN'T GOT THE BRAINS OF US WHITES. LISTEN TO THAT MAN. YOU GOT IT DOWNSTAIRS, MATE, BUT WE GOT IT UPSTAIRS. LIVE UP TREES, YOU BLOKES DO. I SEEN A FILM ABOUT HIS TRIBE ONCE. IT'S CALLED "TARZAN, THE APE MAN." WHEN CHARLIE BLOGS FOUND YOUR LOT, YOU WAS WALKING AROUND STARKERS, LIVING ON MONKEY NUTS. SO THIS IS A MEMBER OF THE GREAT WHITE RACE, AND THERE'S PLENTY LIKE MONTY. WE JUST CALL THEM WHITE TRASH. I DON'T GO FOR THAT EXPRESSION-- "WHITE TRASH." WHAT'S STAFF WILLIAMS? BELT UP! I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT WILLIAMS. THAT I CAN BELIEVE. I'M MAKING A REPORT ABOUT WILLIAMS. NOW LISTEN, ROBERTS, WE'RE ALL AWARE OF WHAT HAPPENED, BUT THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT. YEAH. IT'S A PITY ABOUT STEVENS. WE'RE ALL IN SYMPATHY. HE HAD A ROUGH DEAL. SO I CAN COUNT ON YOU WHEN I GO TO THE COMMANDANT? TO INQUIRE AFTER HIS HEALTH OR WHAT? OF COURSE. AND THEN WE'LL SLAP A MURDER CHARGE AGAINST WILLIAMS. [BELL RINGING] WAKEY, WAKEY! RISE AND SHINE! RISE AND SHINE! WHO KILLED STEVENS? YOU HEAR THAT? ARE YOU GOING TO SIT ON YOUR JACKSIES AND DO NOTHING? [PRISONERS SHOUTING AND BANGING ON BARS] [BLOWS WHISTLE] TAKE OVER, STAFF! STAFF! WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE? SIR, THE PRISONERS. SOUNDS LIKE A VICTORY CELEBRATION. GET EVERY AVAILABLE STAFF HERE ON THE DOUBLE. ARMED, SIR? WHERE THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE...CHICAGO? STAFF! LET THEM OUT!

IT'S WELL-KNOWN HE CAN MAKE THE LAME WALK, THE BLIND SEE, AND THE MAIMED DANCE OVER THE HILL. [LAUGHTER] WHAT ELSE CAN HE DO, STAFF? RIDE A BICYCLE TO THE SEA, NO HANDS, AND TURN WATER INTO WINE, SIR. [LAUGHTER] BUT CAN HE RAISE THE DEAD, STAFF? NO, SIR, HE CAN'T RAISE THEM, BUT HE CAN LOWER THEM.

HARRIS. WHAT HAVE YOU TOLD HIM? I TOLD HIM THE TRUTH, SIR. THE TRUTH? WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, SIR. IT'S WILLIAMS'. IT'S ME! ME! WHO THE HELL RUNS THIS PLACE? RETRACT ALL YOU'VE SAID, CHARLIE! PUT YOUR FINGER ON HIM, BERT. GET HIM. YOU TELLING ME AGAIN HOW TO RUN THIS PLACE, ARE YOU? OUTSIDE, STAFF! SERGEANT MAJOR, ROBERTS IS GOING INTO HOSPITAL.

LET'S START WITH STEVENS. WAS HE FIT? IF I UNDERSTAND YOU RIGHT, BY GOD, YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE. YOU GIVE HIM A MEDICAL? HE DID NOT. I WAS THERE, WASN'T I? PASSED HIM A-1 FIT FOR PUNISHMENT. I PUNISHED HIM ALONGSIDE ROBERTS, KING, BARTLETT, AND McGRATH. WELL, HE'S DEAD. HEAT EXHAUSTION. SUNSTROKE AND-- STEVENS WAS A SICK MAN, AND I ONLY CAUGHT ON WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE. I'LL SWEAR TO IT. YOUR NEGLECT LUMBERED ME WITH A DEAD MAN. NOW, YOU PUT ROBERTS INTO HOSPITAL AND GIVE ME THE CHANCE TO BREAK YOU. SERGEANT MAJOR-- DON'T LET THEM GET AWAY WITH IT. SERGEANT MAJOR, HE'S TRYING BLACKMAIL. YOU HEARD HIM. I'M PUTTING ROBERTS IN A CELL. LOOK, I GAVE AN ORDER. GET ROBERTS INTO HOSPITAL, SIR. A COURT-MARTIAL WILL BREAK YOU, SIR, NOT WILLIAMS. SHUT YOUR TRAP, HARRIS. THE COMMANDANT'S GOT TO CHECK ON THIS LOT NOW. I WON'T BE SLOW IN TELLING HIM. IT'S ME WHO'S GOING TO BUST YOU, BERT. I'M SORRY. I'LL DOUBLE HARRIS TO HIS QUARTERS.

ROBERTS IS GOING TO HOSPITAL. THEN I'M GOING TO SEE THE AREA COMMANDER. TRY AND BLACKMAIL ME, WOULD YOU, WILLIAMS? WELL, TRY IT. GO ON. TRY IT. HAVE YOU ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY? YES, SIR.
