- Fuck. Get off of me! Fucking pigs, get off of me! - What's happening? - Found him walking in the middle of the street. Then he just starts going ape shit. - Put your hands behind your back, cuffs! - I've got it. - Get the fuck off! Fuckers! Mother... - For fuck sake! Calm down, sir, calm down. - Get the fuck off of me! You're not taking me, you're with them! -Sir! - You okay, Sarge? - Yeah, I got this. - Back off, fuck off! - Sir, please calm down, we just wanna help. - Why don't you just leave me alone? - Just stay calm and we can sort all of this out and get you whatever help you need, okay? What's your name? - Freddie. - Okay, Freddie, PC Mathews is gonna take you to an interview room and get you a coffee. Just stay calm, I promise you everything will be okay. - You sure you're okay? Look, just ignore Mathews, he can be a bit of a dick. - I'm fine, it's not that he just doesn't like a woman outranking him, he's an old sweat, I get it. I'm just pissed off that I fucked up in there. I should've secured that cuff. - We all fuck up. You put it right, that's all that matters. - Is there a unit free that can deal with a suicide? - I'll take this one, I need to get outta here for a bit. - Whiskey Zulu Two Zero to comms. I'll take this one, go ahead. - Thanks, Sarge. We have a report of a suicide at Lifton Path. Caller is a Mrs. Peters, the deceased's wife. Are you okay to check this out in the first instant? - ARVs? - Are there any ARVs able to assist? - Let me check, Sarge. No, they're all committed, but I'll get one to the station to collect the shotgun as soon as one becomes available. Best I can do. - It's gonna take 'em hours to get here from the city. - Can you give me an ETA on the ARV? - Negative, we're unable to-- - Whiskey Zulu Two Zero to comms, come in, please? Whiskey Zulu Two Zero to comms, can you hear me? - It's fine, happens a lot out here. - Whiskey Zulu Eight Six, can you read me? We can still use the channel. It's just comms that've got the problem. I'm sure they'll be back on soon. - Well, I will keep trying comms en route. Just make sure you keep monitoring. - Will do. - Catch you later. - Sarge. - Shit. - On 106.8 FM. - We've had a few questions come in during the break. Here's one from Neil in Exeter. He says he's managed to see the shower last night, with his two boys, Jacob and Samuel. - Please, let me do that for you. - Thank you. Maybe your hands are a little steadier. Is that an American accent? - No, Canadian, I transferred to England from Toronto. - Oh, I see, dear. - I know it's hard, but would you mind if I took a few more details from you? - Of course, dear, you carry on. - So, what time did Mr. Peters return home? - Oh, please, he would've preferred you called him John. It was about quarter to six, and he seemed fine. He had a nice time down the pub. He was looking forward to his tea. - And you can't think of any reason John would've taken his life, any health problems, financial difficulties? - No, John was as fit as a fiddle, he walked everywhere. He still looked after that farm, it's just not like him. - I'm so sorry. - I'll be okay, dear. Would you like a biscuit? - Was John a keen gardener as well as working the farm? - Not really. John only did what he had to when it came to the garden. - Did you manage to get a hold of your sister? - No, no, that phone's still not working. - Oh. Okay. Let me try and get a message to her, what's her number? - Oh, that would be wonderful, dear. It's Exbourne. Two one three, nine five nine. - Okay. Whiskey Zulu Two Zero to front office. Mathews, are you receiving? - Mathews here, go ahead. - I'm trying to get a hold of Mrs. Peters' sister. Can you try to reach her your end? - Sorry, Sarge, the phones are down across the whole area, including the station. - It was my fault! - Mrs. Peters, please. - It was my fault! My god damn fault! - Please, just put the gun down. - My god damn fault! - Mrs. Peters, please, just-- - My god damn fault! - Amanda from Thornton on line four. Amanda, can you tell us what's happening where you are? Amanda, you're live on Phonic FM, you're live on air. Have we lost, we've lost Amanda? We've lost Amanda, okay. - Whiskey Zulu Two Zero to Whiskey Zulu Eight Six. - Go ahead. - Hey, Patrick, I've had another suicide. I've had to lock the scene down until I can get a hold of someone to put the balloon up. It's not ideal, but hey, I can't sit there all night. Heading back to the station now. - Zoe, we've had word of a disturbance at the tavern. Not sure what's going on, but I'm making my way there now. Zoe? Zoe, are you still there? - Yeah, I'll get back to you. Shit. Hello? Where'd he go? Jesus. Sir, are you okay? This is the police, can I come in? Sir, please let me in! - It's trying to get in the house. - What is? Are you alone in the house? - It's come back for me. And it wants me, it wants me! - Sir, there is a lady on the road outside your house. Do you know what happened to her? - He did that to her. - Who did? Please let me in! - It's in the house. It's got in the house. I'm scared. I know you're there! Shadows where I can see you! You bloody coward! - Whiskey Zulu Two Zero to Whiskey Zulu Eight Six, urgent. Can anybody hear me? I need another unit. Fuck. Oh, shit. Patrick, can you hear me? - Hey, Zoe, go ahead. - Patrick, I saw it again, I mean this time I really saw it. There is something out here attacking people, I've got an unconscious man with severe injuries and a dead female. - What did you see? What do you mean, "something?" - I don't know, I don't know how to explain it. - Okay, well, keep calm. How bad is the male? - I don't know, I think he's alive. - All right. I'll try comms again and get back to you. - Whiskey Zulu Two Zero to Whiskey Zulu Eight Three. Mathews, are you receiving? Whiskey Zulu Two Zero to Whiskey Zulu Eight Six. Patrick, are you receiving? Patrick! Whiskey Zulu Two Zero to Whiskey Zulu Eight Six. Patrick, are you receiving? Oh, come on, Patrick. - Zoe? - Yes! Patrick, I'm heading straight to the city now to get help. Patrick? Patrick! - Zoe, there are things here, and they are killing people. Fuck. We managed to escape and are safe for the moment, but, they can find us any minute. I'm in the back of the tavern with a few others, but those things, they're in the bar and they're attacking everyone. They just appeared from nowhere. I couldn't stop them, I tried, but if you get too close, they... Hang on. One's coming. We need to be quiet. It's scratching at the door. Okay. It's moved on. God, they can move fast. I don't know what these things are, but I think they might have something to do about comms. Fuck, what're they doing? Keep him quiet. - Patrick, what's happening? - It's Fernod. He's putting something into his eye, oh, shit. It just came out. Zoe, his fucking eye just come out. Zoe, you need to get help. You need to get to the city and get help. - What the hell? - We need backup. We can't manage this by ourselves. Zoe, you've got to get help, you've got to get-- - Patrick? Patrick. - Grab his arms. - What the fuck happened to him? - It's the landlord, he just started going nuts. We had to do this to him to stop from killing himself. - You're gonna have to choke him again. - On three, one, two, three. - Okay. - Is he okay? - I don't know. I'll stay here and check him over. - It's okay, he's a vet. Come through here and keep as quiet as you can. You're okay? - Think so. Fuck, Patrick, what is goin' on? What're those things out here? Have you seen the ships? - Yeah, we've seen 'em. - It's fucking aliens. They're fucking with our brains and killing us, and now you've brought them back here. - Robbie, will you calm the fuck down? - Look, they must've followed me here from the roadblock, but I don't think they saw me come in. - Roadblock? - Yeah, the main city road and the old back road. - Great. - I can't see anything. Happen they've moved off. - How many shells have you got left? - I got three left. - What about the news, anybody seen any TV or radio? - Yeah, it's as if nothing's happening. Just another day. - Do you think it's just this area they're attacking? - Why? What do they want? We live in the middle of fucking nowhere. What can they possibly have to gain from attacking us? - They want to experiment with us, and it ain't the first time, either. Three years ago, I had one of them circles in the middle of my club. Got up in the morning and there it was! And then I found they had butchered two of my prize bulls. Mutilated them. And you lot didn't want to do nothing. - They're trying to control us. - He's right. They want our land. If it isn't the immigrants, it's the bleeding aliens. - Oh, for fuck sake. - Oh, Dale, I don't think they'd have come all this way for a bit of your hay and British beef. - Who cares what it is or what it wants? How are we gonna get out of here? - Okay, everybody, we need to calm down, she's right. We just need to focus on getting ourselves to safety. How's he doing in there? - Oh, he's still out cold, I'm just gonna finish cleaning up his wounds, try and stop any further infections. About all I can do. - Okay. Is there any other way we can make contact with comms? Try to get some help? - No, the phones are down, and there's been nothing from them on the radios. - Perhaps they blocked the frequency? - Patrick, what channel does the city use? - One four nine. - What good is that, that thing won't reach the city. - Doesn't have to, there should be an ARV unit from the city in the area by now. Whiskey Zulu Two Zero to any units, come in, please. - ARV? - Armed Response Vehicle. - Fuck yeah. Now you're talking. - Whiskey Zulu Two Zero to any units, come in, please. - No, wait, the ARVs use a different channel. It's four six seven, I think. - Whiskey Zulu Two Zero to any units, come in, please. - Hello, Whiskey Zulu Two Zero. This is Delta Tanga Four Six. We are en route on the station. - Delta Tango, we are in urgent need of assistance. Can you get through to comms? We've lost contact. - No, we lost contact about 10 minutes ago. What's your situation? - We're with members of the public, and they're under siege. What's your ETA at the station? - We're about 12 miles from-- - It's that lightning again. - Damn it. Delta Tango, come in, please. - They've blocked all the frequencies. - Delta Tango, come in, please. - We're all fucked. - Look, we know they're gonna be at the station. We just need to get ourselves there. - There are more shells for the shotgun at the station. - What's back there? - It's where they attacked. Zoe, they killed everyone in there. We only managed to escape by hiding in the skittle alley. - No, don't. They might be in there again, you'll let them in! - There might still be somebody alive in there. Okay. Nice and slow. Shit. - There was nothing we could do. Over there. Move. - What? - Move! - Now it's in here, I told you not to go out there. Now it's in here, I told you not to go out there. - What happened? - He bit my fucking fingers off. - Robbie, no! It's got Sarah. - I'll help. - We've got to go, Zoe. Come on, Zoe, we've got to go. Come on! - My Land Rover's right outside. - The keys. Keys! - Drive! Can you see anything? - No, nothing. They're not following us. - Fuck, Patrick, see the size of those things. Have you seen any of those already? - No. They're new. - That's a lot of blood. - In that bag's some bandages and vodka. - Why aren't they coming after us? - Maybe they don't need to. - Okay, what's the plan? - Get to the station and wait for the ARV. - What if they're watching the roads? - Maybe they're not watching all of them. We need to at least try. What about Claire and Isaac? - I hope they're all right. They've gone to Cornwall for the weekend, visiting Gran. Is Jason in the city? - Yeah. How are you holding up? - He got an artery. I just can't seem to get enough pressure on it. Fuck. - The landlord did that? - He woke up and just started chomping down on my hand. - Is he still back there? - No, he went out the back, I couldn't stop him. - What the fuck is happening to people? What are those things doing to them? - Like the kid said, it's mind control. - Controlling our minds so that we murder ourselves? - So we kill ourselves. - But why? - Stop the car. - So that they can take over! - Seriously. - Stop the car. - I don't think they need mind control to take over. - Stop the fucking car! I think it's an infection. I think they're infecting us with something, maybe a virus. Aggression, confusion, self-harm. They're all symptoms in brain infection. - Why kill us with a virus? - Why not? Maybe we're just an experiment. - Lab rats? - So, now do you think you're infected? Well, Robbie and Sarah hadn't been attacked by anyone or a thing, like, you don't know that's how it's transmitted. - True, but there's a good chance I am now, and you'll be safer if you get me out of the car. - I think he's right, I think we should let him out. - Keep driving. We keep moving. I have dealt with four suicides today, and not one of them had been attacked. If this is a virus, then it seems to be affecting everybody, and if anyone of us starts showing symptoms, I would rather you were around than lying on a roadside bleeding to death. Let's just get to the station. - Do you think your mates are here yet? - Don't think so, can't see their car. - Get them in. I'm gonna go and check the side door is locked. I'll see you back at the front desk. - Sounds good, see you in five. - Mathews! Mathews, no! - Zoe. Is that... He's gone. - How are we supposed to fight these things? All those people and now Mathews. I tried to stop him, but I couldn't get to him. - Hey, hey. I know. It's okay. You can't save everyone, Zoe. Just concentrate on getting the rest of us out of here okay? Come on, Zoe, we need you. - Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's get to the property store and get to that ammo. We just have to hold out until the ARV arrives. - Yes, Sarge. - How's the hand? - Probably not gonna be writing prescriptions for a while. - Can I take a look? - Probably best not to. Not until I can change the dressing. So what's a Canadian doing in our sleepy rural police force? - I transferred here with my fiance to be closer to his parents. - They live round here? - Oh, in the city, thank god. This was the closest posting I could get. - Not what you're used to? - No, not really. Actually, I was disappointed I couldn't get a more exciting post in the city. - What time did all this start today? - Um, Mr. Peters was the first, I guess, about six PM? God, he shot himself just after he got home from the pub. - What time did he get to the pub? - Oh, I don't know, why? Is that important? - Could be. - Shh! - Look at the size of them. - They're just standing there, watching. Do you think they know we're in here? - I'd say that's a safe bet. - What happens if they get in here? - Maybe they already are. Okay, we need to search the rest of the building, and make sure it's secure. We could be here a while. Oh. - That's all we've got. - Okay. - Look, it's gonna take forever to search this place with those two. - Okay, well, let's get them somewhere safe, and you and I can search. - The cells. They're cut off from the main corridors. - That's good, there's medical supplies there, too. Can you carry him? - Sure. Dale, grab the other arm. - Can't you take that one? - Oh, for fuck sake. - Right, up. Where's everybody else? - We're pretty much it. Cutbacks. Station isn't used much anymore. Everything goes through the city. - Why's it so big? - Used to be an old MOD training post. Guess now they just don't know what to do with it. - Oh. - They you go. - Sit him down in the interview room. I'll grab the kit. - Slowly, keep the pressure on. - How's that? - Good. - How are you doing? - I'll live. Hold it there. - Right there? Need one of those, tape and-- - What else? - The base of the thumb, as tight as you can. - What, like that? - Hey. Dale, are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Don't worry about me. - Okay, look, you try and get some rest, while Patrick and I secure the station, okay? - Yeah, I will. - Ready? - Yep. - Dale, you're gonna have to lock the door behind us. - Yeah, okay. - Okay, first we'll check down here, and then we'll start a sweep upstairs. The east corridor was secure. How were things when you came round the back? - All good, most of those rooms are locked anyway. - Okay, that just leaves that corridor and the west side. And that'll lead us to the stairwell. What do they want? What do they have to gain from infecting us? - Dale could be right. Maybe they do want what we've got. - They're gonna get that by experimenting on us? - Maybe they're trying to find our weaknesses. - Mm, yeah, I guess. Don't you think that's a little odd? In here. - Get away from me, you bitch, get away! Go! Get away from me, you fucks! - Freddie, please calm down. Look, we're trying to help you here. - You think you're so fucking special! - Freddie, drop the knife. Put the knife down, now. - Who else have you got in here? I'll kill every one of you fuckers! Motherfuckers! - Shit! - Back this way. - It's coming. - I know. - There, quick. - Can you carry on? - Yeah. I'll be fine. Dale. Dale! Dale! Dale, open the fucking door! Dale, open the fucking door now! Dale! Dale! - Patrick! - Open the... Come on, come on! Shit. - Let's take a look at that arm. - What took you so long? Where's Dale? - It's not good. I had to wrestle him into one of the cells. Could hear voices and the banging, I just wasn't sure. - Wasn't sure about what? - My head is killing me. What happened? - He got stabbed by a prisoner. - Bastard! - How many of them are out there? - Too many. - Any sign of the ARV guys? - No. Looks like we're on our own. - It's okay, I can walk from here. - Are you okay? - It's just a headache, I can take it from here. - Okay, good. I'm gonna go check on Dale. - I know what you're thinking. You're thinking I'm gonna get you all killed. Just 'cause my legs aren't what they used to be, doesn't mean that I'm bloody useless! Don't leave me here. - I'm not gonna leave you. We're all gonna get outta here and get you to some help. - I don't need any help! Get yourselves some bloody help! I'm sorry. I'm just feeling a little stressed at the moment. I'm not feeling myself. I'm fine. Fine. - Zoe. We need to find a way out of the station. The closer those things get the crazier people start acting. - That I know, Mitchell's not looking too good, either. - And if the ARV unit doesn't arrive-- - I know, I know, look. We'll think of something, okay? I mean, as long as these doors hold, then we're safe in here, right? - I guess. - Zoe? Better get over here. - Oh, god, Dale, what is going on? Dale, what are you doing? Patrick, get this door open now. - Shit. - Come on! - Okay, okay. - Dale! Dale! Can you hear me? Come on! Come on, Dale, wake up! No, try again, try again! - One, two, three! - He's gone. - No, try again! - Zoe? He's gone. - No. No. - Where's Zoe? Hey, Mitchell. You okay? - Yeah, fine. - Where's Zoe? - She's down the other end. - What're you up to? - I haven't seen any of them out there for a while. If we could get to the other side, we could get to the rear exit in the Land Rover. - It could work. - How's that arm? You think you can get through there? - Yeah, not a problem. What about Mitchell? He's getting worse. - Yeah, I know. He's not great, but we don't have many options here. - Okay. Let's do it. - Hey, Mitchell. How are you feeling? - What time is it? - Look, we think we've found a way out of here. Do you think you're okay to move? - A way out? Why, why do we want to get out? - Okay, buddy, come on, time to move. - Are they coming back yet? - Shh. - Mitchell, you have to be quiet, can you do that? Let's go. - I'm next. I'm next. - Try to stay calm and breathe. - What time is it? - He's making too much noise. - It's gonna come soon, I know who's next. - Mitchell, you have to be quiet. - What time is it? What time is it! We need more time. - Come on. - You don't know what you're doing! - Mitchell, we have to go. - Get off me. We're here. We-- - Get back. Come on, you fuckers. - That's the last two. - That's it, I'm out. - Stay down! Clear! - Clear! - Is anybody else in the building? - Look out! - Get the guns! Get him to the Land Lover. - Come on, get up! Come on! Here, I managed to grab an extra mag. You must be almost out. - Thanks. So, what now, where do we go? - More people will have to come soon. Those things can't keep us cut off forever. Until then, we just need to find somewhere safe to lay low. - Hey, we should stay off the main roads. - Zoe? I figured it out. - What is it, Mitchell, what have you figured out? - The farm. - What farm? - You got the farm before Patrick got to the pub. - So, what does that mean? - You're next. - I don't even remember leaving the fucking handgun in there! This ain't over yet. - I know. - We keep fighting. - Yeah. - Hey, Zoe. - What is it? - Someone's coming. - Let's see what he knows. - Are you okay? I heard the gunshots. - We're fine. - Any of those things out here? - No, don't think so. - I haven't seen any for a couple of hours, but, I wouldn't go any further that way, if I was you. They've got the road blocked. - Ah, shit. Look, we can't stay out in the open like this. - Is your house close by? - Yeah, just a little up the road there. Come on, this way, before we're spotted. I thought you buggers were meant to be rescuing me. When's the cavalry coming? - Our comms have been down. We haven't been able to get word out. - Figures. - Check the back. Anything? - No. I think we're good. - Is there anybody else here? - No. Bastards got to my Kathy at the beginning of all this. - I'm sorry. - I'll get more of them, though, before it's over. Drink? That cut out about an hour ago. So, did you get any of 'em? We shot some of those machines, but, it doesn't make a difference. - What about those big buggers? Have you noticed how they keep their distance? Bloody cowards. It's their drones, they're the ones that do the dirty work. - What happened here? - Me and the wife were having a row about something. All of a sudden, she starts to go nuts. She's shaking, like she's having a fit. But her feet, her feet are barely touching the ground. And that's when I saw it. By the time I'd grabbed my shotgun, she was already lying on the floor and that thing was stood there in all its glory. Bam, I shot it, point blank. And that was when I noticed one of the big ones looking in through the window. And I missed him, but I went outside, and I corned him by the barn. He knew exactly what I had in my hand. He backed into that barn like a little girl. I bet he's in there now, wishing he never came to this house. - Are you saying that you've got one of those things locked in your barn? - Oh, don't worry, love, he's not going anywhere. Do you wanna see it? Oh, you're gonna love this. You're gonna bloody love this. - Zoe, this doesn't feel-- - I know. I know, let's just take a look. - How bad is it? - I'm okay. It's fine. - If there's any reward, it's my find, okay? - Fine. - Hope you're not squeamish. - Holy fuck. - What do you think? Can you believe it? It's still alive, even after I cut it in two. They're resilient buggers. You want a go? - This is wrong. - No? Fine. I'll show you how to do it. - What the hell have you been doing here? - What have I been doing here? I've been waging war, son. Fighting the fight! What've you been doing? - This... This is not fighting. - We need to show these bastards who they're messing with. I'll give you something to moan at. Think you can come here, take over our bloody planet. Well, it's our fucking planet. And you? You can fuck off home. Let's see what these bastards are made of. - Come on, Zoe. We've gotta get out of here now. Come on. Come on, let's go. - They're not attacking. - Where are you going? - Patrick! Can't get through! - Come on, this way! - I think they're coming. - Keep running! - Which way? - Zoe. Look. Come on. Let's go. Come on! - Don't they have any other weapons? Why are they not just killing us on sight? - I don't know. - I'm so cold. - Shit. There's more of them. Come on, Zoe, come on. Download more movies for free from GRAHA21.SITE Go, I've got this. - Get in! - Get down! Okay. - My god, look at these people. My fucking head is killing me. - Hey, hey. You're okay. Hang in there. Keep going, you'll be fine. Come on, Zoe, we need to move. - Look. - Shit. - What do we do? We've got nowhere else to go. - Zoe, come on. - We're trapped, Patrick, what's the point in running? - Look, we don't give up, we keep going. - No, wait. Ma'am, are you okay? Do you feel okay? - I think I've been asleep. - Please, take a seat. What happened to you? - I can't remember. I don't know. - Sir, do you feel okay? He's okay, he's fine. - What's going on, what're you doing here? - It's okay, sir, please stay calm. It's okay, take it easy. It's okay, remain calm. - My god, everybody's fine, everybody's okay. What have I done? - Zoe, keep it together, you didn't do anything. - No, think about it, Mitchell. Back at the station, he had it all figured out. - No, no, Mitchell was crazy. He was trying to kill himself, and us. - Oh, no, no, no, he was going crazy, but he wasn't there yet. He was trying to save himself and I didn't let him. What if, what if they've been trying to help all night, and I have been stopping them? - Zoe, come on, you're losing it. Stay with me. We can get through this. - Did I kill all those people? - Zoe, come on. I need your help. - Wait, wait! Look at it! What if it's not a soldier? What if it's a fucking medic? - Zoe, come on. Snap out of it. - God, he was right. It started at the farm. Something happened to that farmer and it spread! - Just stop. What're you doing? - It's okay, Patrick. I know what I'm doing now. - Zoe, don't! Zoe, no! Fight it! Zoe! Zoe, no! Out of my way! Get out of my way! Zoe! Zoe! Zoe! Zoe! No! You bastards!
