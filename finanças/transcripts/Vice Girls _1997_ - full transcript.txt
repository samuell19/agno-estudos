[siren blaring] [tires screeching] [honking] [rock music] Hey! Get 'em, Coop! Freeze! Ugh! [grunting] Ooh! Ooh! Ugh! Ooh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ooh! Shit, it's a chic. Vice. You're busted. [rock music] Congratulations, Coop. Aw, shit. GROUP: Congratulations! Oh, I really need this. [ominous music] Congratulations on finally getting your badge there, Coop. Or maybe I should say Detective Cooper? Yeah, thanks, Bessley. Sweetie, did you know about this? Detective Cooper. I like the sound of that, don't you? Ah, come on, Coop. I know you hate a party, but this one's in your honor so maybe you could just smile a little bit. I don't want a party. Well, you've got one. So damn it, enjoy it. How about a nice club soda? You've earned it. How about a shot of tequila? Straight, no chaser. Come on, Coop. I thought you were on the wagon. And I thought you were a bartender. Come on, Sweetie, give me a break. OK. [ominous music] Is this right? Do I look OK? You know, uh, back when I was a cop, we didn't have any nifty parties for a promotion. No? What'd you get? Well, they, uh, handcuffed me to the legs of a pool table. And then the guys-- [chuckling] they send in this great big hula dancer. A hula dancer? Yeah. And, well, she started to, uh-- why the hell am I telling you this? I have no idea. Pour me another, will you? Listen, don't look now, but here comes Chandler. Looks like he's got a date. With her? Not a chance. Well, Detective Cooper. Heard you had a little trouble getting to bed last night. Buy you a drink, boss? It's my party. I heard two cops on foot patrol found you passed out in front of your apartment building. They had to drag you upstairs and put you to bed. Look. You gonna congratulate me or chew me out? That's the Captain's special way, Coop. Promote, then pounce. Cooper, I want you to meet your new partner, Detective Block. Block, Detective Cooper. EDITH BLOCK: Congratulations, Detective Cooper. Um-- call me Coop. Everybody does. Block just transferred from San Francisco. Well. Have a seat, Block. Let me buy you a drink. I don't drink. Oh, uh. Well, uh, Sweetie serves a mean club soda. Orange juice please, bartender. You got it. And then there's this. [sighs] I know. Eight street kids killed in two months. Great music. Towards you? I want you and Block to go undercover on this. You know Lieutenant Russo? Russo-- the fat guy with hair on his back? Hardly. He's your go-between with Homicide. He has the case summary. He's at your disposal. I'm also sending you a tech expert from downtown in a couple of days. Tech expert? What are we, secret agents? Stop whining. You're going to need all the help you can get. Look, I've got to run. Congratulations. Captain, you're leaving so soon? We didn't even get a chance to dance. [chuckles] My protege. Well, looks like it's you and me, Block. It looks that way. Sweetie, give us another round and I'll quit forever. Last one, Coop. So do you have a first name? Edith. It's Edith. No, really. I mean, what's your first name? It's Edith. OK. I think I'll just stick with Block, if that's all right with you. I'd, uh, appreciate that. [ominous music] So you gonna make me a star? Sweetie, take care of my new partner for a minute, will you? Excuse me, Block. Sure. You. Oh, yes. You're Cooper. Congratulations. You staring at me over there? Sorry. Uh-huh. Follow me. You know, back in my day, we didn't have any Vice Girls. But I've decided, uh, it ain't a bad idea. Inside. You know, your name sounds really familiar to me. Block. Are you sure we have worked together before? I don't think so. I've worked in San Francisco most of my career. Frisco. Love that town. Great seafood. [rock music] I got it. You're that cop that got her partner shot because you were too tough to call for backup. That's enough, Bessley. No, no, no, I knew she looked familiar. I remember now. You know what everybody's saying? That in a way, you killed your own partner. Hey! That incident was a year ago. I have been totally cleared of all allegations. Now, as of 12:00 noon today, I am back on the force. Understand? [rock music] [moaning] [ominous music] [moaning] This is so cool. I feel like a real movie star. [gagging] [gunshot] [heavy breathing] What'd you say your name was? John. John Russo. Lieutenant John Russo? Yeah. [laughing] That figures. You got a case sum ready for me? I left it on the bar. Great. Captain said you were at my disposal. Hey, wait. What-- hey, hey. Where are you going? Your cuffs. [rock music] I hope you understand. My future's in your hands. Did we lose 'em? Yeah, of course we did. Nobody can catch us. What'd you get? Uh-- lots of paper clips, a fancy pen, and looks like an adjustable date stamp. Alls I got was some stationary. Well, we can use the pen and the stationary, and-- and write all our loyal friends and loving families thank yous. [laughing] Yeah. All we need are some stamps. Actually, I'm looking at my only friend. Jesse? JESSE: Yeah? You think it was a stupid idea to rob a stationary store? You mean instead of, like, a fruit stand or the bank or something? Yeah. [laughing] Hey, Jesse, Polly. Hey, Coop. Want to buy a pen? Let's see it. Two bucks. Tell you what. I got some stuff here, just some blankets and food. How about we make a trade? For a cop, you're not too bad. So did you guys check out that runaway shelter yet? Yeah, we checked it out. Somebody stole Jesse's shoes the first night. Your shoes? Aw, Jesus. Sorry about that. You know, I might have an extra pair laying around somewhere. Will you just stop trying to help us? We're doing fine, OK? Thanks anyway, Coop, but, uh, I stole them back. Listen, there's something else, and it's really important. There's been a few murders around here-- young kids just like you. A few murders? I count nine. Where have you been? Polly, she's just trying to help. She's right, it's nine. Did you know that last girl, Michelle? You're even dumber than I thought. Of course we knew her. Take it easy, Polly. Did you ever see her talking to anybody or-- I didn't see anything. Michelle was a very nice kid. She was just really, really stupid. And Jesse and I aren't stupid. I know you're not stupid, Polly. All right, just be careful, OK? Thanks for the stuff. I'll see you around. Bye, Coop. Man, you dug into her. Come on, she's just looking out for us. The only person Coop is looking out for is herself. [phone ringing] COOPER (ON ANSWERING MACHINE): This is Cooper. Leave a message. [beeping] JOHN (ON SPEAKER PHONE): Cooper. Uh, this is John, John Russo. I left a couple of messages before, and, uh-- I know. I'm sorry I've been so busy. JOHN (ON SPEAKER PHONE): --I just thought that after the other night, um-- that is-- well, I wanted to see you again. I could take you out on a proper date. Who wants a proper date? JOHN (ON SPEAKER PHONE): Well, I guess, um-- just give me a call, OK? 555-6373. Bye. [phone clicking] Ugh. [laughing] Two eager, Russo. [ominous music] Strangulation, just like the others. I'd say she was killed someplace else, though, then dropped here. You OK? What? Jesse, her name's Jesse. You knew her. I'm sorry. I wonder if that was even her real name. I was just talking to them yesterday. She's 15. Was 15. Them? She and her friend Polly. Well, maybe she saw something? Let's comb this crime scene. Can't afford to miss a thing, not a single thing. Detective, this one found the body. What's your name? Chrystal. COOPER: What happened, Chrystal? I had some business to conduct here in the alley. You had business with whom? Forget it, he's long gone. All right, go on. So like I already told the cop, me and the guy walk down the alley. Bam, there's this dead body. He freaks out and takes off. I have a little bit of a conscience, so I call the cops. You didn't see anything else? No. All right. Thanks. Take down her address if she has one. Two interesting items over by the body. Notice this? Lens cap. Looks new. Yeah. And this. What is it, a piece of plastic? But it's new. There's no dirt on it. It's shrink wrapped. It says Hi8 Super Crown. Video tape. That's right. [suspenseful music] [sad music] I think I might have seen something. Sweetie, did Wolfgang show? Yeah, he's in the pool room. I, uh, told him I was thinking about putting some strippers in here and I needed his advice. And, well, he bought it and trotted right on over here. Listen, you girls be careful, because he's on to something. No problem. Sweetie, thanks. I owe you one. Remember, we need this guy. This has got to work. Block. Wolfgang does not carry a weapon. We're just gonna talk to him. Think of it as a conversation piece. [snorting] Hold it! Vice! Oh, fuck me. Didn't they teach you anything in prison, Wolfie, or do I have to send you back there? Up yours, babe. [gagging] Wow. Maybe you can teach me that some time. It would be my pleasure. Penny for your thoughts. Dollar for your death. Oh, I just love these little impromptu gatherings. Don't you, Wolfie? Oh, I ain't saying shit to you till I see my lawyer. Well, you know, you might not need your lawyer. Hey, Sweetie, give me a beer here for my pal Wolfgang. Block? Tomato juice. Oh, what is this, a goddamn tea party? Oh, yeah, Wolfie, and you're the guest of honor. We need a favor. And frankly, you owe us one. About 3 grams of favor, I'd say. I guess you've heard there's been a rash of killings. Yeah, hookers. Kids! Street kids. - Yeah? Well, I don't do kids. And I never whacked anybody before. Hey, what's this all about? Get on with this, OK? What, are you in a hurry? Yeah, I got a fucking pedicure at 2:00. You still own that adult video store down on Central? Maybe. You know what maybe gets you these days, Wolfie? About 10 years in the big house. And considering your past indiscretions, I think they might even keep you longer. Yeah, yeah, I own the place. Big deal. Hey, can I get some of that beer? I'm dying here. So are these kids. Russo. You never called. Cooper. This is Lieutenant Mindy Turner. Chandler brought her on. She's your tech support. I know Mindy. I requested her. Hello, Coop. Lieutenant, this is Detective Block. [suspenseful music] I know Block. Well, great. Then we're all friends here. Russo, what do you got? What about him? What about my beer? Oh, don't worry about Wolfie. He's just about to sign on with the Vice Girls. Vice Girls? [laughing] It's cute. Uh, listen, we got a link here for what it's worth. Turner. The lens cap found at the scene comes from a Hi8 video camera, which would match the Hi8 shrink wrap. They film a lot of pornography on this type of camera. They're not too expensive and the quality is pretty good. Well, what do you think about it, Turner? Well, I'd say somebody was taping the killings. Snuff films perhaps? Hoo. And snuff film sell for lots of money. Don't they, Wolfie? Yeah, well-- well, I wouldn't know. I'm only into what's legal. Anyway, I'm a fine, upstanding member of the community now. I try to stay away from that stuff. Well, we got a list of suspects here. I want you to invite them to your little, uh, autograph party. - What! That'll fuck my business! Yeah, you're already fucked, Wolfgang! Coop, I need a word. You think about it. Del Vecchio, in my office. So what's up, Russo? Well, um, I wanted to-- to talk to you about the party the other night. You and I at the party and, you know, what happened and all. But, um, I just-- I-- I get the feeling that you don't. I don't what? [laughing] You just don't want to talk about it. Oh, on the contrary, Russo. I'd love to talk about it. I had a great time. What about you? Well, yeah. Uh, you know. I had a-- I had a-- [clearing throat] I had a great time too, actually. Great. Then everybody's happy. So were you gonna join me for a tinkle here, or what? No, no. [clattering] MINDY: Bitch! [grunting] Ugh! Hey, hey! What the hell's going on here? I thought we were all friends? Detective Turner knew my old-- [glass shattering] --partner. Shit. Are you happy, Turner? Her partner was my friend. What, do you think she did it on purpose? MINDY: That's not the point! That is entirely the point, Mindy. Do you think she's the first cop that ever made a mistake, lost a partner in the line of duty? All right, maybe she should have call for a backup. She didn't. Maybe she thought she could handle it. I made a mistake like that once myself. We all make mistakes. We do things that we regret for the rest of our lives. Look, you're cops. People get killed. That is the goddamn job. So why don't you get out there and do the job you've been hired to do. Catch that killer. [groaning] I'm all right. I just love female boding. Who doesn't? Why don't you shut the hell up! All right, here's the deal. You help us out, and we forget about your little sinus condition. You chicks are nuts. Fuck me. [rock music playing] How's it going, Quentin? It's going great, Mr. Love. We're selling out of everything. You know, this is just like a real movie set. Dominique Star right here in the store. The cops in the back with a sting operation. Will you keep your mouth shut about that, you idiot! Sorry, boss. Do you think you could introduce me to Dominique Star? All right. Look, just don't go on about the movies the way you do, OK? Say hello, nice to meet you, goodbye, and that's it. Got it? - Got it. Go. Excuse me, Dominique, this is my store clerk, Quentin. He wanted to meet you. Fritzi. Nice to meet you. Nice suit. Thanks. You know, Miss Star, I'm a big fan of yours. I've seen all your movies. And I'm a filmmaker too. Maybe we could get together sometime and discuss the state of the cinema? Trends and applications-- [clearing throat] Nice to meet you. Goodbye. Nice to meet you. Goodbye. Bye-bye. Mr. Trope. [laughing] How are you? I'm fine, just fine. Listen, you asked me to let you know if I ran into anything special in the area of your interest. Oh, like that last item. That was superlative. Listen, I have a live item today. Very tender. You might say, uh, a young nubile. Oh! Oh, a nubile! You don't say? [laughing] I do say, Mr. Trope. And for a mere 60 bucks, she'll do her little schoolgirl dance for you. Right now, live. Well, Mr. Love, I happen to have three 20s right here in my pocket. Will $60 do? $60 is perfect. Just go on back right through the door. You know the way. Thank you, Mr. Love. Thank you very much. [suspenseful music] Excuse me, miss. This is the school girl dance, isn't it? What? MINDY: Let me zoom in on him. Well? Here. I'll turn up the volume in the left breast. No, it's not him. I don't think so. Well, I mean, it's hard to tell. It was so dark. What I mean is, you're not. You gotta be 25 years old. You, sir, are an insulting pedophile. And I was told you were 12. Vice. You're busted. TROPE: What? Tape anything interesting on that video camera, Mr. Trope? Why? Where's your lens cap? I-- I lost it. Yeah right. Come on, let's go. But I didn't do anything! Yeah, well, we'll think of something. TROPE: Come on! Gimme a break! I have to make a little adjustment here. Excuse me. - Mm-hmm. I must admit, Turner, this is the most intriguing surveillance device I've ever operated. Thanks. Just be careful of the nipples. They're very sensitive. Right. [rock music playing] Send back one more. You got it. Hey, this ain't what I paid for! Really? Ugh! No, it's not him. [music - "vice girl boogie"] Boogie boogie. Sugar boogie. Boogie boogie. Boogie boogie. Vice boogie. Sugar vice. Boogie boogie. Vice boogie. Boogie boogie. Sugar vie. Boogie boogie. Vice boogie. Boogie boogie. Huh! Yeah. Boogie boogie. Vice boogie. Boogie. Huh! Sugar vice girl. Vice girl. Whoa! Sugar vice girl. Sugar vice girl. [sighing] She must have taken off. Who? Polly. The whole place is empty. Wolfgang's got it all locked up. Oh, great. When the hell did she slip out? I don't know, but I think she really felt bad about coming up short today. Yeah, but that's not her fault. She is only 15. So Captain finds out we lost the one person who might have seen-- Too late. He just found out. Don't you ever knock, Captain? I take it you accomplished nothing here, other than losing the one person who saw the killer. Am I right? We'll find her. Let me see if I got this straight. You three meter maids spend a whole day trying to finger a perp with a 15-year-old hooker who might have seen something somewhere? Russo tells me a simple lineup of suspects wasn't good enough for you. Well, I didn't exactly say that-- Shut up, Russo. You had to go through this whole charade. Is that it? The facts exactly, sir. Block. If I were you, I'd start getting serious about doing my job. Just one more thing. While you three were goofing off, there was another murder. Let's go, Russo. Sorry, Coop. [laughing] Why don't you three badge bimbos get the hell out of my store? Bad timing. Very bad timing! [shouting] Forget about him! Take it easy! - Sounds like my speech worked. - I hope so. I still need you to keep an eye on Coop. She tends to bend the rules a little too much. I don't want her to screw up this case. Stay on top of her. Understand? I will, sir. You know, an obvious thing has occurred to me in the Captain's absence. [coughing] How can a scum sucker like you be in this business and not know about snuff films? Where to get them, who makes them. You know, ladies, I think Wolfie here knows far more than he's letting on. Now, you see this gun? Poor little gun. It only has one bullet. But where? Now, every time I ask you a question and you don't tell me what I want to hear, I pull the trigger. [gun clicking] - Jesus! - You didn't answer me! That's one! - Please, don't. Don't, don't. [gun clicking] Two! Jesus Christ, you didn't even ask me a question! You tell me what I want to know! I-- I don't know anything! I don't handle that stuff! I swear to you. Maybe three's a charm, then? No, no, no, no! It's-- it's in a file cabinet in the second drawer. Check it, Block. You better not be playing with me, Wolfgang. - It's empty. - It's in there! It's in there! It's taped up underneath, I swear! Got it. Thanks, Wolfie. Here's a little party favor for you. [bullet clanging] WOMAN (ON VIDEO): Ooh, that was good. I want some more. Is your friends still-- hey! What the hell are you doing with that! Hey! Hey! No! [gunshot] [thudding] Good Lord. Well, there's not much to go on. Yeah, but it's all we've got. Listen, Wolfgang. You're going to get us an introduction to the person who made this tape. Fuck me. What am I doing here? I'm supposed to be tech support. Stop complaining. We're undercover. Ugh. I'm a little bit too undercover for my liking. I think you look great, babe. - Are you afraid? - Certainly not. Then pet him. Pet Henry. WOLFGANG: Tralaine. Mr. Love, you skanky smut peddler. Glad you could make it. Mint julep? Thank you. As you can see, I deliver. This is Jan, Edith, and Mindy. Mindy. An ancient name. I watched you walk in. Reminded me of that beautiful goddess Isis. [laughing] You must have me confused with some other goddess. (WHISPERING) Mindy! (WHISPERING) What? You know, Tralaine, these babes really dig your movies. Films, Wolfgang. Films. Oh, yes, we love all your films. Really? Hmm. "Come All Ye Faithful." A holiday classic. Is that your video camera? Oh, one of many. Marvelous little device, really. "The Night of the Naughty Necrophiliac." Oh, I loved it! Looks like you lost your lens cap. Well, aren't you the observant little cinematographer. "The Island of Dr. Lesbo." Now, that's a movie. Mindy, it's clear to me that you are a true sex-tellectual. MINDY: Ah! It's funny your friends don't look the type. COOPER: We don't? No. What do we look like? Cops. I'm kidding! Relaxez-vous! [laughing] Wolfgang, why don't you show Jan and Edith to the dance floor? I'll entertain Mindy. Well, I, um-- Let's dance. Uh-- [dance music] Loosen up, Block. Whip it. Tralaine, you're one heck of a dancer. Isis, you're my wet dream come true. Why, hello there, darling. Hello, Elvis. It's Elroy. Sheryl, you really think you're the only one whose libido is manipulated by external forces? Well, I hope not. I strongly resent having my libido pulled to and fro by every Madison Avenue huckster. Not to mention Hollywood and its minions. [dance music] [laughing] [glugging] [giggling] Oh yeah. Hey. Oh yeah. Oh baby. [laughing] Mm-hmm. [laughing] [groaning] Fascinating. I mean-- [laughing nervously] I split and I-- and I go home and I get in the shower. And all of a sudden, I'm staring at the shower head. And-- and, you know, I'm staring at it. And I start thinking, what if shower heads could talk? Well, I'm finding I'm becoming a really big, big star. What if the damn thing had eyes? What if it's looking at me? Hey, what if it's looking at me right now? So, Isis. You're quite sure you'd like to work in film-- my film? Tralaine, it's a dream come true. That's good. I'll arrange a little audition. Detective Cooper? What are you doing here? I'm undercover, Quentin. Cool it. You've certainly got the look down for this party, Detective Cooper. My friends call me Coop. How'd you get into this party anyway? I thought it was pretty exclusive? It's all who you know. You know, I'm kind of Tralaine's protege. He's actually quite brilliant, and he's very, very well-respected in the genre. You snuck in, didn't you? They think I'm part of the kitchen staff. [laughing] What are you looking for down there? Actually, I-- No, don't tell me. You lost your lens cap. Yeah. Did you find it? No. So, yeah, yeah. So I jumped out of the shower. I couldn't take it anymore. [tango music] Tango? Why not? It would appear that Tralaine has made his choice. You think she'll be OK? My impression has been that Mindy can take of herself. [laughing] She really nailed you with that beer bottle. I would remind you that she took me by surprise. Well, no sense in wasting an open bar. Come on, Block. Coop, I told you. I don't drink. I know, but maybe they've got some imported guava juice or something. Come on. Hmm. I quite like guava juice. I haven't showered since. I can't. I can't! Fred, I think you're full of crap. [rock music] I've been thinking about my older days. And I'm wondering if I'm wasting my life away. To me, the creative act is one of struggle. An effervescent battle between heaven and earth. A throbbing, thrusting, undulat-- oof! Idiot! Mr. Tralaine. I don't know you. How did you get into my party? Actually, I-- Where did you get that video camera? Did you steal it? Absolutely not, sir. I'm a filmmaker too. And I'm your biggest fan. A fan! Well. Do you mind? I'd be honored. Ah. [shattering] Now get out. But I've seen all your movies. Get out before I have you thrown out. Out. We have got to get her out of here before she blows our cover. Come on, can't you at least try and walk? I can walk. This is bad. This is very bad. Are you guys ignoring me? We're not ignoring you. Let's go. (LAUGHING) I just love you guys. I'm fine. You are not. Come on, let me go. Will you quit looking at me like that, Block? I know my limit. Well, it doesn't appear that you do. Look, thanks for the ride, Block. Goodnight. Do you need anything before I go? Um-- there's some aspirin on the bookshelf in my dining room. Could you bring me four? [laughing] [suspenseful music] Here. Why do you have a picture of you and Polly? Detective, what does this picture mean? It's none of your goddamn business. This girl is involved in the investigation of several homicides. If you don't tell me the nature of this picture, I'll have no other choice than to involve Captain Chandler. Yeah, you're a good cop, Block, but you gotta loosen up a little. Look, I haven't done anything wrong, unless you call having a picture of my sister in my home a crime. Your sister? Yeah, Polly's my sister. Our parents were killed three years ago by a-- it doesn't matter. They're dead, all right? Polly came to live with me. It just didn't work, you know? I mean, we fought all the time. Well-- I drank and she fought. I tried try to convince her to come home, but she just wouldn't. You know, I've tried, and I've tried, but she-- You have not tried hard enough. You know, there isn't a day that goes by that I don't worry about her and wonder what scumbag she might have to-- she's a big girl, Block. You know? Polly is 15 years old. She's 15! Goodnight, Block. But why did he pick me? I'm just supposed to be tech support. Oh, relax, Melissa. You techies are always fantasizing about getting down and dirty. Here's your chance. You ladies OK? Yeah, Sweetie, we're fine. Listen, uh, I owe you another one. You got that right. What are you doing anyway? Modern science, Sweetie. Mindy rigged up this, uh, high-tech bullet bra. It's coming pretty handy. It's got audio visual capabilities, computerized chassis, and it's fully adjustable. This way she can keep in contact with Block and myself at all times. And the underwire acts as the antenna. OK. Let's, uh, check that nipple focus. Looks good from here. Picture perfect. Switching to tracking. Great. Also, should Tralaine want to take her elsewhere for the audition, we can track for miles with this thing. Hey, there we are. I'm impressed. What are you staring at? I was just contemplating whether perspiration could cause any kind of electrical shock. It's fully grounded. Where are you gonna hide your piece? Don't ask. Hey, Sweetie. SWEETIE: Hey. How you doing, buddy? - Good, man. Block. Wow. Mindy, you look-- slutty. Thanks, Russo. Yeah. Detective. Russo. Well, I just came by to see if you needed anything. We don't need your help, Russo. You're the one who sent Chandler to Wolfgang's video store after us in the first place. It was not pleasant. Well. I just did it by the book, Cooper. Section 12, paragraph 4-- You know, that's your problem, Russo. You're a friggin' bookworm! Coop, I suggest we don't have time for this right now. Bookworm? Well, thank you very much, Vice Girl. In my office now. Yeah, yeah, very nice. What? [rock music] [moaning] [clearing throat] And I hope that's perfectly clear, Mr. Russo. What happened? Where's Russo? You know, Coop, I think you should take it easy on the guy. I think he's got a crush on you. Think so? So, everybody ready? Block? - Ready. - Mindy? - Ready. Sweetie? For a guy that ain't going no place, I guess I'm ready. Great. Let's do it. Take it easy, girls. And good luck. Oh my god, there's Polly. Where the hell have you been? Leave me alone. Polly, what happened? Look, why don't you just get back in the car with your friends and leave me the hell alone. Polly, why the hell did you run out on us? I couldn't ID the guy. It was too dark that night. I thought I could, but I couldn't. Polly, can't you see? If-- Look, I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna tell me to get off the streets and go live with you. What is with this sudden interest in my life? What, did you run out of money for booze? Polly. [suspenseful music] [doorbell buzzing] TRALAINE (ON INTERCOM): Come in, Isis. [whip cracking] Oh, mighty Isis. Tralaine. Come in, my beloved. I won't be long, dear. I'm just shooting a very emotional scene upstairs. Pivotal moment for the characters, really. Oh, I'm so weary of lifting everyone up, up, up. Although it is creatively invigorating. Don't go away, now. I do so love auditions. MINDY (ON MICROPHONE): I just got stage fright. [suspenseful music] OK, I'm out. Doing some snooping. Switching to visual. Nothing downstairs. Gonna go to the second floor. Be careful, Melissa. She can't hear you. I know. [moaning] I'm upstairs. Here some people moaning. Must be the movie. It sounds pretty fake. I'm gonna take a peek. Tralaine's in there. I think he's got a gun. This doesn't feel right, Block. Get in there. I'll call for backup and be right behind you. Good, good, good, Bob. Now move aside. Hey, what the hell! No, don't! [gunshot] Tralaine, no! [gunshot] Vice. Everybody freeze! Hey, what's going on? This isn't in the script. What the hell is going on here? It's a movie! What? Fake bullets, fake blood. She's fine. You're fine, right? Fine. Fine? Yeah, I'm fine. Don't shoot me, mighty Isis! I don't have a gun, Tralaine, or I just might. It was an accident! Your startled me! Isis, you're magnificent. Stupendous. Sex-sational. Tralaine, what is going on here? We're making magic, of course! And, well, simply buckets of money. The really sick people out there think it's real, and I'm only too happy to supply the illusion. How old are you? Uh, 21. COOPER: Yeah, let's see your ID. I-- I left it my other pants. What other pants? You're not wearing any pants. How old are you? 17. 17. I'm surrounded by vipers! Book him. Yes, yes, she was fine. But you know how it is. They only seem to last through one film. The cops? Well, they had to let me go. My lawyer is too good for 'em. Besides, what do you think they have on me? A 17-year-old hooker? She'll never testify. You can trust me on that one. Yes, it was a good thing I was firing blanks. But the footage does not look good. I think we'll have to go back to tried and true methods. Yes, I got some good possibilities at the party. Mm-hmm. I'm well aware of that, Steve. Well, you'll just have to stall them. [gagging] All right. This is Grandma's recipe. She's probably looking down at us in complete shock that I'm cooking, let alone cooking her soup. Let me see that thermometer. Hey, it looks like that aspirin worked. You're getting better already. Go ahead, eat. Remember this day? Yeah, I remember it. It was before I knew what a lush was. Look, Polly, I know I've been a rotten sister. I know I've let you down. Nobody's perfect. I mean, I'm not. Mom and Dad being gone still really hurts. But what hurts me even more is knowing you're out there on the streets. I wish things could be different, you know. I mean, I just wish that you would make an effort. You could try. Spare me. I'm gonna go crash on the couch. [plates clattering] Morning. Hi. I thought I'd make us some eggs. Is that OK? Yeah, it's great. [phone ringing] Cooper. EDITH (ON PHONE): It's Block. Yeah, Block, what is it? EDITH (ON PHONE): We received a tape. What kind of a tape? EDITH (ON PHONE): It's the real thing. Apparently from our killer. It was addressed to you. All right, listen. Meet met at Sweetie's bar. I don't want to run into Chandler. Listen, Polly, I have to go. Yeah well, me too. I gotta go. No, listen. Polly, I want you to stay here with me and be safe. Will you just try it? Please? OK. Great. I'll call you as soon as I can, all right? OK. Sweetie, what can I say? Three. You owe me three. Yeah, I know. Let's see the tape. WOMAN (ON VIDEO): So, you're gonna make me a star? [suspenseful music] This is so cool. I feel like a real movie star. Great music. Towards you? [gagging] [muffled yelling] That was no fake. Indeed. Analysis, Block? The brand name on that cassette matches that of the shrink wrap in evidence. It appears to be the same killer. Go on. Well, the killer's hand reaching from behind the camera appeared to be a man's hand. And based on the strength required for strangulation, I'd say that was a same assumption. And this tape was dropped off, not mailed? That's correct. Take the tape back to headquarters. Start going through all the surveillance tapes of the precinct entrance. That will take some time. Well, then get going. - Turner. - Yes, Coop. Help Block. I was afraid you'd say that. Buy you a beer? What? A beer. Can I buy you a beer? Isn't it against regulations to drink on duty? It's 10 AM already. What are you, a bookworm or something? Block, I wanted to tell you that-- I-- I just wanted-- I've been trying to tell you that-- Yes, Detective? Well, you remember back at Tralaine's mansion, right? Yes, I can recall that. I know you can remember it, Block. Do you have to be so damn literal all the time? I do endeavor to be precise. Well, that's not the point, Block. I'm trying to say thank you. Thank you? Yes. For what? For saving my life. Actually, I did not save your life. Tralaine was firing blanks. Yeah, but you didn't know that when you jumped between us. And I just wanted to say thank you. I only did what any other trained law enforcement officer would have done. So your thank you is misplaced. I'm trying to say thank you, you idiot. You're welcome. And, Block? Yes? About what happened in San Francisco. I-- I know you're a good cop. You know what, Sweetie? I think I'll, uh, have coffee instead. Coffee? I'm turning over a new leaf. Coffee is a sensible drink. You want regular or decaf? Don't push it. All right, so what shall we toast to? Let's toast to family. I will toast to family. To all the families all over the world, carpe diem, and e pluribus unum, and justice for all. You know, I didn't think it would happen, Russo, but, uh, you may be coming around. Is that a good thing? Well, you passed the head test with flying colors. RUSSO: The head test? Great head on demand. You're obedient, Russo. I like that in a love slave. Thank you. What? What is it? Your tie. RUSSO: My tie. You like that? No, no, no. On the tape. The tie. The victim had a skinny little tie around her neck. Where have I seen a tie like that before? I don't know. Tie Town? How could I be so stupid! What-- what's the name of that guy, uh, the video guy-- Wolfgang Love. No, no, the other guy. Oh, Quentin? Yeah, exactly! Sweetie, give me the phone. Wait-- wait a minute. Are you talking about Wolfgang's assistant? That weird, quirky little guy, always wears the same outfit? That's the one. I gotta call Polly. His name's not Quentin, it's Arnold. Arnold, uh, Hilowitz. I know because I've checked his ID a dozen times just to bust his balls. [phone ringing] Shit, no answer. Arnold Hilowitz? I'm sure of it. Let's hit it, Russo. She's gone. He's got her, I can feel it. Maybe she just left on her own? No, this place is a mess. So what? Russo, Polly's not like that. And look, a street kid does not leave her jacket behind. Nah, it doesn't feel right. Something bad has happened. Get an APB out on Arnold Hilowitz aka Quentin. Call Block and Turner at the station and have them meet me here. Then meet me at Wolfgang's video store. I'm taking your car. Here you go. Shit! [muffled yelling] Locked. All locked up, Block. What do you think? A little persuasion. No. No, we don't have a search warrant. Russo! Where's Coop? She should be here. Russo! All right. [rock music] Block, Russo! He's dead. Ah, shit. I'll call the Captain. You two need to find Coop. Coop's place first? Might be some clues there. Then Tralaine's mansion. It should be empty. Go! [suspenseful music] [breathing heavily] Hilowitz, you murdering bastard! Where is my sister? It's Quentin. Polly! Are you OK! Mm-hmm. Has he done anything to you? Uh-uh. Say something, Coop. I always knew you'd make an excellent actress. I just had to have you in one of my films. And now I've had the good fortune of snagging both Cooper sisters. What a coup! I know that you're both ready to give a really excellent performance. I'm not performing anything for you, you bastard! And that's the key, isn't it? You're not performing, and yet what a performance. COOPER: What are you talking about, Hilowitz? I'm talking about how difficult it is to find somebody who can make it truly believable. You know what I mean? You're sick, Arnold. Never call me Arnold. [locator beeping] And those other two, your partners. What are their names, Blockhead and Curly? They just don't have that special something that the camera loves. But you have it, Coop. And a nickname to boot. Look, if it's me you want, you've got me. Why don't you let Polly go? Oh, no. If I did that, I'd have to rewrite the entire script. And believe me, that can be a real pain in the ass for the director. You'd be lucky to direct traffic. That's what my ex-boss Wolfgang said. COOPER: What do you mean ex-boss? Oh, didn't you hear? Wolfgang went to that big peep show in the sky. Can you believe that bastard wanted me to work overtime? Well, forget it. Not for minimum wage. So I shoved a few of my favorite films down his throat, and that was that. Do you think I qualify for unemployment? Top five, in no special order. That's easy. "Godfather." Of course. "Taxi Driver." COOPER: Naturally. "Midnight Cowboy." COOPER: I love that one. How many is that? Three. Gosh, let's see. No special order, remember. Right, thank god for that. COOPER: I know. Oh! "The Magnificent Seven." Interesting. One more. "Guys and Dolls." Really? Would have never pegged you for a musical theater guy. Oh, yeah, I love that stuff. In fact, I'm hoping to make my life story into a musical someday. Kind of a neurotic thriller. A real song and dance man, huh? You betcha. Hey! What are you trying to pull? You think I'm fresh out of film school or something? I believe this is your gun, Detective Cooper. I'm not usually much into firearms, although they do come in handy. I'm more the hands-on type. I think you know what I mean. Did you get a chance to view my work? Your work? The tape I sent you. You're a sick fuck, Arnold. I said Quentin! So did you see it? Yeah, I saw it. What'd you think? COOPER: Of what? Her performance. She was good. She stank! She couldn't take direction. She couldn't hit her marks. That girl couldn't act to save her life. Now it's your turn, Polly. Let's see what you can do. What do you say? Quentin, don't do it! You asshole! You killed Jesse! She couldn't take direction either. Polly! I'm sorry, Jan. COOPER: It's my fault. I'm the one who should be sorry. Hmm. That was pretty good, but let's try once more. With feeling. No! No! Please don't! Don't! Gee, Polly, you put the rest to shame. Let's loosen you up and see what you can do, huh? Now stand on the bed, Polly. Go ahead, Polly. It'll be all right. Do it, Polly! Stand on the bed! Now dance a jig. The cute little ditty that would make your parents proud. You don't have to do that, Polly. There you go again! One director. One set. You know, Polly, now would be a great time to tell him to go straight to hell! Go to hell. You're ruining everything. I know, Arnold. Ugh! Get the gun, Polly! Back off! Untie me, Polly! Now dance. I said dance, Arnold! This is for Jesse! EDITH: Freeze! Vice! This is a closed set. [gunshots] Cut. Jan. Are you OK? Of course I'm OK. Block, untie me. He's dead, Jan. Are you OK? That's the question. I don't know. I'm shaking all over. What took you guys so long? We got here as soon as we could. Just in time, I'd say. I killed him. I killed the murderer. No, you didn't. Detectives Turner and Block did it. But I shot him with your gun. No, it-- it was Tralaine's gun. It only shoots blanks. Now aren't you glad you didn't kill somebody? I was so scared. Oh, I know, sweetie, I know. [crying] But it's all over. And I promise you that no one is ever gonna hurt you again. [suspenseful music] It's gonna be OK. He's an ex what? Agent. Turns out Quentin was Arnold Hilowitz, ex Hollywood agent and big time psycho. They all want to direct. When no one would let him behind the camera, he decided to branch out on his own. Coop, did you ever suspect that Quentin was after you? Not at all. I guess Polly must have been next on his list. He followed her to my house. I was his lucky bonus. It's a good thing Polly doesn't know the truth about that gun. What gun? Never mind. All right. Can I buy you a drink, Coop? No thanks. - How is Polly? - Great. She's back at the house with me, and she's talking about going back to high school. It's hard to believe that we spent so much time at that video store with Polly trying to catch a killer who was right under our noses. You know, it sure is. I remember this one time I was on this case. And it was in-- Sorry, Sweetie, you know I've already heard this one. Would you excuse us for a minute? All right, but just-- just one more thing, Coop. What's that? How in the world did Mindy and Block find Quentin's place? Sweetie, I'm surprised at you. That's an easy one. All it took was brains, brawn, and one hell of a bra. [laughing] Come on. Well. OK. [laughing] Yeah, uh. [music - "holly wood"] Hollywood is crumbling down. Memories are all that I found. The only stars that come out at night are wearing spiked heels, fishnet tights. The streets are alive with deadly sights. She came from Nebraska to LA. Prom queen high school place. Some say, darling, I can help. Just take two of these. There's a friend of mine I want you to see. He's the one who can get you where you want to be. Darling, though we know you made the grade. Do you want to pay the price and do the time that it takes? Dreams aren't slow. You know they come cheap. But the price you pay can linger on. So pack up your troubles and move on. There's nothing here that's really gonna last too long. Home is where your heart is, that I know. The sooner you leave, the more that you can take when you go. A broken heart is all this town has ever known. And now that you know the brutal truth. All the derelicts, thieves, degenerates and the wasted youth. Pack up your grandma's plaid handbag and go away knowing you ain't coming back. Oh oh oh oh. Oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh. Oh oh oh.
