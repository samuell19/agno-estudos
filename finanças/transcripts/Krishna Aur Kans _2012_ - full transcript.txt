Your marriage with Prince Vasudev.. ..promises to be the first alliance for peace Eighteen warring clans will be united This is the beginning of my dream for a golden age But.. Cousin Kans... it's got to be you Devaki, you are the apple of my eye But I find it so hard to believe... ..that you are getting married and leaving us Live a long and healthy life I had promised your father.. ..that you will be given a wedding fit for a princess of Mathura I have fulfilled my promise Akrur, won't you bless Devaki?

No! He isn't threatening Please! Have mercy upon us... Should I invite my death? No! Neither I nor Devaki will cause of your death ... ..it is the eighth son I.. I give you my word... Each of Devaki's sons, as soon as they are born, I shall give to you You are truthful and a man of honor, Vasudev But as long as I am alive, you shall remain my prisoner Soldier... As you wish, my Lord Kans has imprisoned his cousin.. ..and her husband It's because of that prophecy... ..that Devaki's eighth son, will kill Kans How cruel of him... to throw a newly-wedded couple into the dungeons How could he be so heartless... this son of Ugrasen? The list of his misdeeds grows longer... it's said that Kans has angered his father This would've Qualified for a death sentence.. ..this betrayal borders on treason but a crown prince is given a chance to defend himself I shall defend myself by the might of my sword, Your MaJesty The blade that got rid of Mathura's enemies.. ..will be my defense in the face of your charges What you have done is not only unJust, it Is a sin Self defence is every warrior's right... If that doesn't satisfy your Question, you may also retire to a prison, to debate good and bad in peace Are you threatening me... threatening your father...? How dare you threaten the emperor? Not threatening, dear Father... I advise you to be careful Akrur, now I wish that I never had this son... I am a total failure as a father.. ..Or, is he a punishment for my sins? Keep faith, Your MaJesty The night is darkest Just before the beginning of a new dawn Who is more unfortunate than I... ..to spend my wedding night in prison... Nothing can happen against God's will, Devaki It is possible that this life is prison may mean freedom for many What does Vasudev's clan think of themselves? For Vasudev's sake... they are willing to pick a fight with you? If the stupid subJects of our kingdom support this idea.. ..it can become a dangerous situation Use the fear of an attack, declare emergency... ..in the name of security of the state... and imprison everyone who sympathizes with Devaki and Vasudev And hang anyone who dares to oppose us Hang them Victory to King Kans Victory to King Kans Long live the king Your MaJesty, a holy man wants to meet you A holy man? In the kingdom of Kans? I warned him that the king has ordered all holy men.. ..to leave the kingdom And...? He said, tell the king that Narad has come Narad? Why did'nt you tell me earlier, you fool? Narad is a devotee of Lord Vishnu, my enemy He is worth my time if I can find out.. ..what Lord Vishnu is plotting against me Praised be the Lord Praised be the Lord A devotee of Lord Vishnu in the kingdom of his biggest enemy? Are you so scared of me that you have left him.. ..to Join me? One who sees God's presence everywhere has no fear I have come to advise you.. ..that the very God you want to fight lives within you All that lives within me is my ambition. You are certainly a mighty king. But both the mightiest and the wisest know that.. the power of life and death is in God's hands. Your MaJesty... I have come to make good my promise Here is my first born... my son I am unfortunate that.. ..I can not feel happy at his birth Narad, you see... The life of this baby is in my hands Nothing that you say about morals can stop me I can do whatever I want Bring me your eighth son... I am waiting... I shall forever be grateful for your kindness Now tell me Narad, who is more powerful? Me or Lord Vishnu? As you can see, I even control Death Such pride is not good Kans Lord Vishnu rules all creation Time also follows His design Oppose Him and you invite destruction While there is still time, change your ways.. ..and seek forgiveness from the Lord For Kans, there is no God! Kans rules Earth by his might Soon, I shall also conQuer the skies and heavens... and your Gods and you god-men will all serve me as slaves Then instead of singing the praises of the Lord.. ..you will all sing my praises. Your ignorance is your misfortune To protect His disciples, to destroy the likes of you, The Lord has decided to assume human form and appear on earth That time is at hand, and reJoicing has begun The Gods are descending on earth as humans. In the time ahead, your death waits. Mark, my words But by the time you realise your mistakes.. ..it will already be too late for you Your MaJesty, there's no point in taking Narad seriously He's only good at twisting facts You are our emperor, your life is precious What value is a child's life, compared to yours? MaJesty, this waiting for the eighth son means.. ..giving death seven chances to cheat you But of course! Odds are, that the first son could be as dangerous as the eighth I knew it! Kans can never be so cruel! I was the apple of his eye... that makes you his dearest nephew Oh... it's you...! His MaJesty has been kind... has he come to set us free...? Yes! Has my son brought us our freedom...? Couldn't stay away from the little one... ..so I thought, let's pay him a visit Yes, our son is so lovable.. I could keep on looking at him forever.. Look at him glowing, like the full moon A good comparison... your little one... is like the moon, about to be eclipsed... But... what...? Your son and I are linked by destiny For me, he is death... and I mean death for him. You said that you'd spare his life... ..because, he's our first born In this lotus, which petal is number one.. ..and which is the eighth...? Who can say...? Clockwise, the first is also the eighth.. ..counter clockwise the eighth is also the first Any petal can be that number eight That's why each of your sons can mean my death Give him up No... no... Spare my son! Don't... When the earth is scorched sing a song of hope For our darkest of times there's a song of hope For our world to be a nicer place For life without sorrow's traces For the darkness to be lit... that the Sun may shine upon us...

My friend... tears in a time for Joy? I would've reJoiced at the birth.. ..but... it has been eleven days since, and still... she has not opened her eyes... She has opened her eyes! She opened her eyes at Krishna's touch! Perhaps your daughter didn't open her eyes.. ..because she wanted to see Krishna first I want to name her Radha.. ..the first devotee of Krishna I don't understand this... how did an infant like Radha recognise Krishna? Set your mind to it and it defies logic. But seek within your hearts and you may realise... theirs is an eternal friendship Your daughter Radha is no ordinary girl. She is the feminine expression of the Joy of life Trinavart Mighty Kans, what do you wish? Pootna never returned... she's gone without a trace... Trinavart, now you are the one who will kill the one.. ..who intends to kill me This is my wish Nobody has survived my tornadoes May my Krishna's arms and his hands.. ..grow longer, stronger, faster May my Krishna's legs and his feet.. ..grow longer, stronger, faster And God protect you from the evil eye Help... My baby... It was strange that a child should possess such strength, unimaginable that this child would come to our rescue It surprised all men to hear such tales And thus came to be Krishna's following It was strange that a child could overcome such evil, unimaginable that this child would challenge tyranny It surprised all men to hear of his courage ... thus Krishna's following came to be It was strange that a child could overcome such evil, unimaginable that this child would challenge tyranny My baby... Thank God! In our village every day we have seen Krishna at play That lovely little boy... showed us how to move the moon Growing up amongst us, he makes us think... if there can be a mystery in every mischief we see We have seen him, everyone has seen him We have seen his miracles at play Oh, let him steal some butter Let him play his flute He's blue He's as Quick as deer And there's a peacock feather in his crest He's always after pots of milk And he will thrash anyone who tries to bully us We're glad he's here with us Glad to hear his flute, glad to hear his song As glad as Radha is, when she dances to his song In our village every day we have seen Krishna at play Oh, let him steal some butter Let him play his flute Just imagine that little mite... has the guts to put up a fight ! Our Krishna is afraid of no one Even his worried mother smiles And when he laughs, in that ringing laughter hides, the whole universe Glad to hear his flute, glad to hear his song As glad as Radha is, when she dances to his song In our village every day we have seen Krishna at play That lovely little boy... showed us how to move the moon Where is that enemy of mine... where is he? Pootna has disappeared Trinavart has vanished What strange powers protect him? Bakasur... Look! Eat ! We have lots more Yashoda is such a wonderful mother to her children Krishna is so full of mischief, but she never loses her temper Duddy if you do as I say... we will get as much milk to drink as we want! Look at the way she is walking! She is not walking, she is dancing Looks like she is going to see her boyfriend She's so funny, I'm nearly breathless... but ... does laughter also leave you light-headed? I guess a good laugh lightens your burden Hey Krishna...? Run Yes, go on, run... hide where you can! Wait till I tell Yashoda... all about these pranks... then she is going to take care of you Krishna you should.. ..sweet-talk your mother And get it over with before these girls turn up Hey Krishna... Come here my darling... Come here Why are you standing there? Come... Mother, I've made a mistake Mistake? What could my little Krishna have done! It's all this... cream... and butter... Cream and butter? What's this about? Speak up I've never seen such delicious cream and butter in all my life, mother! You are not even seven years old and you're talking about life? You see this cream and butter every day... Can you give me a little mother? Not now. Wait a bit son, don't be in a hurry, Be patient, everything here is yours ... If you wait the reward will be sweeter It's very difficult to wait when it's right in front of you Krishna stop wasting time! Figure a way out! Those girls are right here! Mother I have a Question... So ask... First you say I've made a mistake. Then you say... this is the most delicous cream and butter you have seen in your life... And now you say you have a Question? Mother am I not your son? Who has been saying this to you? You're my little darling They all say you bought me at the market. Tell me mother, am I not your son? The market? Who dares to say that? Tell me who ... let them come in front of me! Right! Very good! Krishna deserves to be punished! Punished? Why would I punish Krishna? He destroyed our milk-pots and stole the milk We have all the milk and cream we'll ever need. Why would Krishna steal? Why would we lie, Yashoda? Do we enJoy complaining about Krishna? Yashoda, it was certainly him. This beautiful complexion.. ..the headfull of curls, the sweet mischievous smile... Who else could it be but Krishna? Mothet they're lying Look me in the eye and swear that.. ..you saw me breaking your pots and then drinking the milk...? Yes! Krishna smashed my milk and drank the pot... I mean smashed the pot and milk... No, no, no! The pot was in the milk... Oh God! What do I do? I want to say it... I can't say it... He made us brides and confused the monkey No, no! Made the monkey a bride and then... Oh I can't look at him... I can't look away... What do we do? Krishna always puts us in his spell and manages to get away. What do we do? Enough, enough You girls are blaming him for nothing Now go and take fresh milk from the store. Go... Krishna you also go... you have to take the cows to the fields. Will you open your eyes, or shall I open them for you? In the face of merciless persecution, in the face of violence, hatred, deliver us from evil, oh Lord! Oh Lord, may Thy kingdom come Balram... there he is... This is what you call ''out of the pan and into the fire'' Find a blanket Krishna, Jump I am afraid... Don't be scared. Jump! We're here for you It is easy to say Jump when you are standing there. Looking down from here all I can think of is broken bones... Now what? Krishna Just shut your eyes and take the plunge... No... Your destroyer has taken birth... Your death awaits you The eighth born son will be your end... MaJesty... Your MaJesty, But I've done nothing... Where is my destroyer? My destroyer... where is he? Why does he not reveal himself? Where does he hide? MaJesty He is merely a child And he has brought you to this state...? I feel very pained to see you like this... Pained? Then why don't you do something? What is this magical power protecting him? Who dares to be Kans' enemy? Who is this... so fearless? Excuse me, Your MaJesty... You are the one who sounds fearful Mighty Kans, this fear is unbecoming of you Yes! I am filled with fear What a strange situation... the Mighty Kans is afraid of a mere baby? However I ... I shall surely overcome my fear I will conQuer death Wherever my destroyer is I will destroy him I will annihilate him I will annihilate him The Victor shall destroy with all his might, all evil that stands in his way Only a ConQueror can overcome the demons that besiege him A Hero will rise to every challenge, in the moment of truth, he will hold his ground Come Judgment day, holocaust and apocalypse, only the Hero shall save and redeem What is happening? Is this really an earthQuake, or am I imagining it? What fears have overcome me of late? The hunt for this boy... has lasted for ten years and still there's no a trace of him...? What's ten years, Kans? One can seek Him for centuries, millenniums,.. .. lifetimes and all ages of man... but you will see Him only when He wants to see you Narad... If you know so much about that boy,.. ..you must also know where he is? Ah... I know because He wishes me to know And it is because of His wish that ... this is the time for you to know. Kans, your destroyer, Vasudev and Devaki's eighth son, Krishna... is in Vrindavan...in the care of his foster parents Nand and Yashoda and their son Balram... Vasudev and Devaki deceived me Akrur, I shall not rest in peace until I have met my dearest nephew You must get to Vrindavan Quickly and fetch my beloved nephew Invite him to the wrestling matches in the arena of Mathura I have ached ten long, long years to set my eyes upon him Let there be no delay. Depart, now Krishna... His Excellency Arkur of Mathura has come... We are honored by your presence, Your Excellency All my life, I have waited eagerly to see You Krishna Here you are before me, yet I cannot believe my eyes Krishna, my Lord! You are the one the world has awaited All creatures bright and beautiful, all yearn for You Because each seeks divine love and Joy This world can provide kingdoms, and riches and wealth, eminence... But nothing worldly provides Joy or bliss Of that eternal bliss, You are the fountainhead To show us the path of selfless devotion, of endless love, You come amongst us again and again When the world is full of misery and grief You take mercy upon us .. ..and descend amongst us to lead us to truth and light Kans is a cruel king He has cast aside his duties as a king He is ruling Mathura with the help of demons He imprisoned his father and declared himself Emperor Eighteen tribes have been forced to flee their homelands And your parents... the torture that he has inflicted upon your parents... In his attempt to eliminate you, he killed your brothers,.. .. six of them in cold blood I cannot describe to you his cruelty in words All her life, your mother could only weep helplessly for.. ..the children she has seen murdered And the unspeakable pain and sorrow.. ..that your father has lived with... The time for my parents' freedom... and Kans' death has come It's high time that the world is rid of this evil Kans is inviting gladiators to wrestle in his arena He has invited you too To make a public show of your death in Mathura's arena And I have the sad task... to escort you there There is no cause for worry, Your Excellency What do you say, brother? Whenever I hear the flute... the lilting flute why am I overwhelmed, why does my heart aches, why do my eyes yearn, why does my heart aches, why do my eyes yearn, oh why do tears come to my thirsting eyes? Have you heard Krishna's flute, have you felt the emotional tides, the heartache, my yearnings? Why does my heart ache, why do I yearn so... oh why do tears come to my thirsting eyes, at the sound of the wind in a flute? Here amongst the people of Vrindavan,.. .. I have found that love can be devotion I've found your love can be selfless, devoid of any desire, .. ..even wish or purpose Almost divine, such love is boundless and full of Joy And you Radha... I am seeing in you love as if in human form, personified To tell the truth, I can never love you... as much as you love me For love is a debt that can never be repaid Forgive me, Radha. Mathura is where I need to be There's a world waiting for me out there... my destiny is calling me... Oh do not remind me of times with you... I have stopped fighting those memories But why are you so pitiless,.. ..or is your music's pleasure in making me sad? Will you ever return to me Krishna, my friend, my foe... Have you ever heard His flute, passion's surge that music makes, the tortured heart... that brings tears to eyes... the tortured heart... that brings tears to eyes... Oh why do I weep Have you ever heard His flute, Attention! Our most beloved... our ruler and provider... the sovereign of Mathura...
