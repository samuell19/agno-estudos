Around the World When You Were My Age And you, my little brother come along! See that days go by and they never return, the South is still waiting for you! Accept the adventure, listen to your calling, now, right now before the irrevocable moment is gone! All you need to do is close the door behind you, and take a joyful step out. When you let go of your old life, a new one will come forth at once! And later, much later, one day, when you have emptied your glass, and have finished playing, then, you may return here to your home, and rest by your river, with all your good memories as dear companions! Before your journey, had you ever left Japan? No, I had never been anywhere else. What is your first recollection of the trip? My first recollection? When the time came for departure, my family was there to say goodbye. I left on a boat, a Soviet ship named Baikal. I left from Yokohama on one of those boats. I went to Nahotka. The image in that moment... ...indeed, when leaving by boat there's always... a baffling feeling of sadness... I remember well the faces of those that came to bid farewell. The boat is late to depart, people must be getting impatient. Finally the gong echoes. We slowly pull away from the dock. A murmur is heard, coming from the people by the water, voices ceasing to be voices. The strap finally snaps and people's faces move away. My parents and friends came. We will not see each other for nearly a year. The lady from customs is beautiful, she has an amazing look in her eyes. But not even a smile! Her indifference is striking. The city of Nakhodka is also sad. I visited the public gardens but I barely saw any trees... Only men wearing old clothes and bored faces, roaming from one side to the other. My first image of the Soviet Union is opposite to the one Japanese newspapers like to praise: the image of an opulent country. Everything here is awfully poor and desolate I catch a train to Khabarovsk. Sixteen hours. The monotonous landscape of the Siberian forest passes endlessly. Only very rarely do I see a house. They say they are built like movie settings to cover up poor buildings best not shown. in Khabarovsk I don't have time to see anything. I go directly to the airport. I get to Moscow on a jet plane in about eight hours. Moscow is a cold city. When I arrived, yesterday and today, it is truly cold! Then, the city is exceedingly large. It seems that there is no human scale, or that the Russians' scale is unreasonably large. The streets and squares are huge, enormous! The shops aren't very well defined you only understand what kind of store after you are in it... The hotel I am staying in has very high ceilings that prevent me from resting... I stare at them during the night and end up with this immense feeling of solitude. For a moment, my heart races. On my way back to the hotel I was walking along a very wide street, dreaming about finding beautiful girls like Olenka, Chekhov's 'Darling', when I came across a huge man with a bottle of vodka under his arm. Wearing a common dark blue suit he really looked like a union leader. 'Tovarishch' (Comrade) 'yaponsky?' (Japanese) 'Da.' (yes) Next thing I know, we're arm in arm, walking and drinking vodka straight from the bottle. We were already stumbling when we started jumping and singing something that sounded like the "Moscow Nights"... Dear friend, the night is getting whiter My love, your blue pupils! Please, don't forget this summer These nights in the outskirts of Moscow... And then he turned to me, truly moved, and embraced me with frightening strength... "No! No! Please, stop...!" In a moment, his huge, sharp mouth blocked mine smearing it with slobber and alcohol. I can't remember what happened after that. Next thing I know, I was in a sleeping-carriage on my way to Finland. 28th of August, international train Moscow-Helsinki. Given yesterday's binge I slept wonderfully. I'm wakened by the morning brisk and get up at seven. What were you like, while you were on this journey? What was I like? I was 30 years young. Full of energy... I had also practiced Judo. I liked to eat... After all... I had a lot of energy. And I was interested in many things. I was traveling with a backpack that weighed about 50 lbs. My hair was short, like any other normal Japanese boy. And during the trip it grew down to my shoulders, like a hippie's. 1st of September. I'm going to Turku, the oldest city in Finland with about 800 years of history. The youth lodging costs about four markka a day. It is entirely run by nuns. This place is extremely clean and cosy. If we walk North from the lodging, we arrive at the city center. This is where I met a university student called Terttu. She's 20 years old and in her first year at the University of Turku. She speaks English very well, but so quickly that I cannot understand every word. However, it's enough to understand the essential. I ask her a lot of questions. One day we went to the forest. We walked for about one kilometer on a curvy dirt path Ahead of us a great forest emerged. We went into the forest. It is full of dark coniferous, like the white fir and the scotch pine. Here and there we notice more luminous Nordic pine trees that merge in great harmony with all the other trees. Beneath these pine trees there are many wild blueberry bushes covered with berries. She tells me she loves blueberries and starts to pick and eat them. They are slightly sweet, these small charming blue fruits. You see rocks scattered around the forest. These rocks are covered with lichens. They are food for the reindeer and other wild animals. Perhaps that is why the forest seems to be so beautifully carpeted all it's lichens nicely trimmed. We sit on the lichen carpet. Birds sing. Squirrels play. No one else to be seen. Only mushrooms. The crisp end of summer breeze shakes the tree tops. It's a deal warmer in the forest than it is outside. Peace! This is peace at its best. Sometimes I listen closely. The birds' song along with her gasping breath, and my own. We look up at the sky. A blue and clear dazzling sky. I went to cities like Farsta and Vällingby. New cities are beautiful and well accomplished, spacious and comfortable, but you indeed feel the lack of human presence, and I ask myself if people are truly happy living in them. They make me miss the old Japanese towns, the taverns and the takoyaki stands with their red akachōchin lanterns. Life is very expensive in Stockholm. With the exception of milk, everything is expensive. I would get bread, sausages or ham, tomatoes, cucumbers, milk, and packets of salad. It is impossible to stay for very long in such an expensive country. 20th of September. I hitched three rides between Aarhus and Odense. In Denmark alcohol and cigarettes are very expensive. So I haven't been drinking. Thanks to that I became a lot healthier. When leading a poorer life you appreciate more the value of things. Even an old rope becomes precious. Due to that, when you're missing something you're not compelled to spend money right away. In Japan, though life became easier, most people are living in polluted cities and the stress caused by work has increased. Odense is the town where Andersen was born. I visit the house where he was born. A very simple and beautiful house. Copenhagen in the last days of September but it is as cold as Japan in December. The streets are extremely clean. Can it be that Europe (well, I have only yet seen Scandinavia) is all this monotonous and tedious? Can you tell me about your eyes? My eyes... Some years ago I lost partial sight in my right eye, I began seeing less and less, and in March this year I essentially lost my right sight. And I started loosing sight in my left eye as well. The problem is in the 'retina', that's how you say it in Latin, there was a bleeding in the retina and due to that bleeding, I am no longer able to see images. The reason is unknown, they don't know why it happens. It seems it's a disease that affects older people. For this reason I can't read. Despite that hindrance, I can still walk around. I had asked him to read me his diary, but he can't. I don't know how to read Japanese. I have to ask someone... On the 1st of October I spend the night in Hamburg. 2nd of October. I hitch a ride with a soldier from the American military base in Germany, all the way to Frankfurt on the 'autobahn' or on German highways without a speed limit along 400 Km. The lodging in Frankfurt is packed with youngsters from all over the world. Among them there's a young Japanese from America. His name is Okazaki. Our encounter would completely change my trip. He lived in Los Angeles but was now traveling in Europe. He worked in the United States as a gardener for a year and a half. He is surely a madman, to leave Japan with only 50 dollars. When he returns, he will set up a unique kind of traveling agency. He says he wants to have an antique shop, not to earn money, but for pure pleasure. He also says "it's rare that Japanese over thirty..." "venture out traveling on a life of drifting," "those who do so must be very eccentric individuals..." This comment confuses me. He told me he had bought the car for 400 dollars, second hand, in Frankfurt, and that he would now head to Munich and Austria. And that's when we decided to share the gas and go together. Thankfully there wasn't much traffic on the highway. but half-way there the car breaks down. We try to understand what the problem is but the car isn't moving at all. Okazaki's car breaks a lot. The front lights break. The breaks break. It overheats again. An infiltration in the radiator. A 400 dollar car becomes a 700 dollar one and our trip had barely started... Dad, why do you like gardens so much? More than liking gardens, I have learned to like them. Because when I started university, the course I wanted wasn't available. And the one I liked the most out of those available was landscape architecture. Which means planning gardens. Since the course existed I thought it was the best one for me and I chose it. Only then did I start to appreciate gardens on a professional level. Light is comforting and conveys a sense of happiness. A spacious garden. Few people. Trees grow around the garden. In the distance a bird shaped statue rises in the sky. What were you feeling in that moment? Where is the bird? That is maybe Schönbrunn in Austria. A part of the great Schönbrunn gardens. And this forest growing on the sides is called 'bosque'. In Latin it's 'boscus'. It's a typical continental Europe garden style. The person who designed the Schönbrunn gardens was a disciple of the talented landscaper, Le Nôtre. The Schönbrunn palace. Trees trimmed in the shape of arches as if they were galleries in a building... Plants here are taken care of as materials in an architectural design. You only need to prune them because they grow. They are nothing but a material, whose growth man masters and shapes according to an image in his mind, in this case, a geometrically shaped garden. In Japan there's this tradition to exhaustively move and arrange nature; the man doesn't tire of the meticulous work of detail. But the purpose of his manipulations is not to create something different from nature, but to recreate it in a way that enhances its natural essence. Venice is where I feel for the first time the thrill of a large town, the overcrowding, the murmur of the people, folk's daily dynamics. Here there are cheerful streets that I couldn't find in the Nordic countries, a social spirit and vivacity. 23rd of October. Duomo, Piazza Della Signoria Palazzo Vecchio, Ponte Vecchio, Giardini Boboli: architectural gardens, tamed Palazzo Pitti, Piazza Pitti, Piazzale Michelangelo. Spread out, here and there, you find groups of thirty to forty people chatting. The murmur of their voices echoes. Why do they gather here? Italian words emerge from darkness. The fountain's spout, the church's bell, the sound of doors and footsteps, the children's voice... Murmur, murmur, chatter, chatter... Chattering murmur, like waves pulling close and falling away. The south of Italy is a whimsical region. I don't feel the presence of intellectuals, but people are so caring and friendly it's impossible not to be charmed. Like having spaghetti under a blue sky, to the gentle music of an accordion and violin played by the homeless. Ah, I suddenly feel the whole of Europe condensed in that one instant! Is this the traveler's dream? In this dirty corner, with this meal, under a blue sky, this soothing musical moment. My heart is at rest. Two of Gaudi's designs. The house La Pedrera and the temple La Sagrada Famíila. These buildings are amazing. I wasn't able to enter either. I feel as if I am before a rise against modern civilization. The man who created this must've had an unusual spiritual drive. A street with trees. Young boy and girl walk together. Perhaps they are siblings. Buildings rise on the right. Both walking forward. The boy looks back at my father. Maybe he called them. From the boy's expression, it seems this is the first time they have seen him. He... maybe invited me to his house. If we could see car plates or street signs we would be able to tell. But this way I can't figure it out. I've forgotten. I have to look at other pictures to remember. When I was a young girl I believed in spirits. I thought the spirit of the ones who died would remain. I supposed I was being watched. The spirits of those I loved... I believed they were close and protecting me. I enjoyed believing that. As long as I did, the world was more fun. I walk up a small slope. I see a lovely girl sitting on the side of the road, reading a book. A singing voice flows, embedded in flamenco nostalgia. The hillside leaning over the city offers a fabulous view. I quickly imagine the poor, yet perhaps happy lives these people lead. I felt an inexplicable relief when walking by a beautiful girl. Franco and his extreme conservatism governed Spain. We stayed together in a lodge when they asked us for our passports and found out we weren't married. The owner of the lodge gave us a sermon: "In Spain you can't sleep in the same room if you're not married!" "Arrange to get married soon, you hear me?" Okazaki came to visit at the youth lodging. This unlikely re-encounter had me confused. But what he then told me was shocking. He was driving his car along the countryside past Valencia, when, for driving too fast, he drifted on a curve and flipped several times, landing in a garden. It was a miracle no one got hurt. The car was crushed and the front glass was broken. Yet, we were able to get to Madrid with plastic covering the windshield and driving very slowly. He tells me he wants to sell the car, so we tried to sell it but nobody showed interest. We decided to drive the car to Lisbon where we would end up leaving it. The Spanish landscapes and towns on the way to Portugal make up a fantastic view. The olive groves that spread out of sight, the herds of sheep and the young people riding donkeys that give me a feeling of déjà vu; the aqueducts, the stone walls, the marvelous paths through giant eucalyptus... The car drives towards the sun sinking in the horizon. A great, red-orange like sun. A town made of white houses. Everything seems as if from a dream. The land zigzags along the curves. On the night of the 21st of November, with the crushed car, missing its front glass, we crossed the Portuguese border, safe and sound. Where do you live now? I live in Portugal. It's been 25 years in Portugal and Japan got left behind without me noticing. Have I finally become Portuguese? My Japanese pronunciation is getting worse and the number of words I don't understand and can't pronounce is growing. My dreams are in Portuguese now, they used to be in Japanese. Elvas, a small, old border town where we had stop. This town is truly dreamlike. The dream begins with the soup I ate. A puréed bean soup with vegetables. It tasted like miso soup to me. The sidewalk made of limestone. Two and a half inch blocks covering the ground, it's beautiful. This type of pavement involves a great amount of time and manpower. I watched a stretch of sidewalk being repaired in a street in downtown Lisbon. Three pavers and three helpers, making a total of six workers. It took them an hour to mend a square meter. Why do they maintain such an unproductive job? It surely creates a calmer and more graceful atmosphere than asphalt. This beautiful pavement is used in the entire country. Is Portugal's emblem a proclamation of a set of values that praise beauty over efficiency. Alfama. This neighborhood survived the great 1755 earthquake. It's now an old neighborhood converted to a slum. In this city it's common to have children come to you asking for money. They hold out their hand and say 'Please, money for food!' 'Please, a escudo!' Because they are mostly four and five year old girls, it's even sadder. Vila Franca de Xira. Two nights between the 29th and the 30th of November. We stayed in a small attic room in a hostel. We talked about the future and the possibility of me going to work with him in America. 1st of December. Today he returns to Lisbon to catch a plane to America. I'm driving towards Spain. The morning fog was dense. I wasn't able to sleep much tonight. Perhaps because I got sentimental. I took him to the station in Vila Franca but the train was late and the goodbye was somewhat cold. It was suppose to arrive at 10:45 but only got there by 11:40. Then, we thought it would leave at once but it only parted at 12:45. Still, nobody complained. Such temperate folk. In every way contrary to Japan. Morocco, Morocco! The red land. A rainbow sitting at the edge of the world. It's Africa! Being in this desert land, with no one else, makes me feel a different kind of solitude, deeper than what a stranger feels in a city. There's a certain form of time that distances you. Lives and crafts repeated throughout millenniums. Faraway, very faraway, above infinity, a herd of sheep and the people following it move in some eternity with no apparent change. Children of twelve or thirteen years come up to sell things speaking a very reasonable English. It's perplexing to find such young children worried about their livelihood. This gets me thinking about Japan, full of spoiled kids, alienated by games and consumed by boredom. Here they start talking and thinking like adults from a very young age, working out their own ideas to subsist. These are the children that come up to me with elaborate speeches about the value and quality of the product they want to sell me: hashish. In the park, two girls come up to me and ask for the time. They are both dark skinned. And one of them is truly gorgeous. Maria e Sazia. They tell me they're students. They must be from rich families. Delicate Moroccan flowers. I ask them to let me take a picture. And here I go, in distant Morocco, thousands of kilometers away from my homeland... A big cloud of snow rose and I got lost in the mountain. The car drifted and crashed through a road barrier. By luck, as it was falling towards the river, it stopped and I escaped death. I found out through the Japanese Embassy's newspaper that Yukio Mishima had killed himself by harakiri. I met a 24 year old boy named Mohamed. I stayed under his care for two nights, in a room he rented in Argel. The building looked more like a warehouse. The cold wind blew in from between the cracks in the broken window. He made dinner with a friend. Under dim light, the three of us used our hands to eat out of the same bowl. It was great. We shared the same glass for water as well. I didn't feel displaced in this lifestyle. It felt completely natural. I changed during this long journey. When I turn off the light before going to sleep Mohamed asks me to leave it on. I ask him why and he tells me that it will provide some warmth. I nearly cried... Wooden boards covered the cement floor where we were sleeping, dressed and covered with a blanket. I'm awakened at dawn because of the cold. The bathroom didn't even have a light. Such poverty.. Poor it is, indeed, but my heart is soft and warm. It reminds me of my teenage years, poor but happy, in post-war Japan. Departure from Argel. Another journey on my own. The car lights burn out. The water in the radiator is heating up. The fuses are blown. I ask someone at the gas station to repair the car. However, I'm tricked and it is worse than before. Now the lights don't turn off, not even when I take the keys from the ignition. Shit. In the meantime they burn out again. It's dangerous to continue, so I stop in the closest village. They tell me they can repair the car. It's New Year's Eve. I thought of drinking wine at the hotel, even though I was alone, but I can't get alcohol anywhere. I give up on the wine. For 900 millimes I stay in a luxury hotel, in a double room, writing letters. Here they don't celebrate the new year. This is how my New Year's eve will be here in Tunisia. Goodbye 1970! According to the sailing company the boats are delayed because of a strike in Italy. This disorganization annoys me. It's so different from Japan. During the night it's really cold, even inside the car. By dawn I can't stand it any longer and I turn on the engine. I'm not yet ready for such ordeals. But it's a good experience, a good exercise. I stare at a fixed point outside. The window becomes distorted. It's raindrops running down the front window. I'm not sure if it's just because of sleeping in the car, but my body is sore. I've been sleeping in my car for a week now. Yugoslavia. The roads are terrible. All people from customs at border protection were very nice. One of them looked like Tito. I'm hoping the car doesn't break down. I thought of spending a night in Zagreb but all was covered in snow, and the city was sad, desolate, and boring, so I continued all the way to Belgrade, over 395 km away. I drive during the night. Because of all the bumps, the lights burn out every now and then. I spend the next fifteen hours driving and it starts to get dark. The sound of the windscreen wipers makes me anxious. The prolonged silence while driving makes me feel lonely. In this Greek land I feel some kind of longing. I part towards Creta from the Piraeus harbor. I left the car in the harbor's parking lot. When I boarded the small boat I exchanged a look with a beautiful occidental woman. She smiled. So I smiled back. Her name is July. For Quebec separatists like July, the British are responsible for seizing Canada from the French. in her opinion, British Canadians had generated a slow process of corruption that oppressed the French Canadian people. July maintains that Quebec is the last fortress of French culture and for that reason it should be independent. Matala is such a secluded villa it doesn't even have electricity. You find some caves here and there, excavated in the rocks. They are remains of ancient times. Hippies lived here, the contemporaries of the ancients. If you look closely you see the caves are very well sculpted. They got rid of the hippies because they smoked marijuana and posed a threat to public order and social norms, truth is, they got along fine with the villagers. People here are friendly and kind to me. 1st of April, Thursday. I visit the Acropolis. It's set on the top of a small hill, at the end of a paved marble path. When asking for directions I met a student in her second year at the University of Athens. Her name is Lía. She's tall and blonde. She's 19 years old. And very slim. The glasses she wears lend her a playful girly look. Without the glasses her gaze is calm and graceful. She wears a big Prussian blue overcoat, a black leather mini-skirt and a pink sweater. At six in the afternoon I meet Lía. I only think of holding her. We visit a park in the area and climb up the mountain. We could see the whole of Athens. The view is also amazing at night and the wind feels nice. The temperature is mild, like Japanese spring. You can also find blossoming cherry trees in the outskirts of Athens. Lía sure feels like a girlfriend. At every encounter and every separation we kiss on the lips. We walk hand-in-hand or arm-in-arm. Her curly blonde hair reminded me of an old statue of Aphrodite. Even though I was a stranger she had only just met she took care of me with extraordinary devotion. Just like the Greek sky and sea. And that was an image wished to keep pure in my memory. What plants do you have in the garden? Ah, plenty! Starting with the trees, we have the walnut tree, the loquat, the persimmon tree, the willow tree... ...this one is a weeping willow. We also have the cotoneaster, honeysuckles, Salisbury, mistletoe, monsteras, Reeve's sprirae, rhododendron, azaleas, bamboo, nasturtiums, Siberian iris, Japanese iris, yukka... ...and there are more, many more. Japanese wisteria, sunflowers, magnolias, camellias, hydrangeas, we also have Japanese bay leaf, white jasmine, plumbago, Japanese honeysuckle... ...isn't that enough? What is your happiest moment? My happiest moment is... eating delicious things. I was born during the war, I grew up in a time when not much food was available, so, I really enjoy eating. I came to Portugal, right? And still I can't speak Portuguese properly. For that reason, Portugal is still a foreign country to me. It will be, forever. In other words, my identity... ...is in a place far from here. But when Ary was born this feeling somewhat changed. Grandpa went to the forest to chop wood. Grandma went to the river to wash clothes. While Grandma was washing clothes a big peach and a small peach came floating down the river. Grandma sang: "Little peach, move away. Big peach, come this way." And so the big peach came floating towards Grandma. And as she grabbed the big peach Grandma cheered: "What a wonderful peach I will have for Grandpa" So when her husband was back from the mountain, Grandma told him what had happened. "Look at the peach I found, let's slice it and eat it!" And as they sliced open the peach... What is it? Oh, there it is! So beautiful! - A baby! - How beautiful! So beautiful, so beautiful! So, shall we keep him? What do you think, grandpa? Yes, we shall. Let's do that. Are you coming with us? The dark sky is tinted red, the night falls in Turkey. Run, Taunus! One more day with no accidents, maybe I'll make it to the end safe and sound. In these moments I long for a lover by my side, with whom I could share the enjoyment of these beautiful landscapes. I have to write Lía a letter when I get to Syria. Today I met a young South African boy traveling from Saudi Arabia. He told me the war was still going in Jordan. The Israeli army against Palestinian fighters, a revolution fed by wrath... Perhaps it's better not to go to Jordan. For no special reason, I feel the pleasure of traveling. I think: now I'm in Beirut, the heart of the Middle East. I've decided to push this car to its end. Its shell is worn out, but the engine is as good as new. Ideally, I would be able to get back to Europe in this car. But I first have to surmount the great mountain range between Lebanon and Syria. I cross Antakya and continue towards Latakia, in Syria. The road up the mountain is steep. The view is sublime. On the side of the road I see a shepherd, enjoying the sun, holding a shotgun. When I was five years old, my neighbor's older brother joined the military. All the people from our town gathered waving flags for courage and good luck. And later, some years into the war, we could die at any time because of the bomb, so we moved to the countryside. We were far away in the mountains. We moved to a small village deep in a mountain. We stayed with our mother in the countryside. But my father and my teenage brother stayed in our city home to protect the house. And that's when the napalm bombs began falling all over Tokyo. And a bomb actually landed on our roof. My father and brother went up to put it out. But many houses burned down. When you looked at the sky over Tokyo, at a time when the war was drawing to an end, the sky was crimson, burning... even though we were 200 km away from Tokyo. That was the scenario. Tokyo was shelled by the American troops. It was terrible; they dropped napalm bombs downtown and created a sea of fire that made it impossible for people to run away. In just one night, a hundred thousand people were killed. Many of those caught by the flames jumped into the river. They jumped in the river, but the waters in March are too cold, and children were collapsing, while getting frozen. And the mothers watching this were losing their minds in despair. What year was that? March 10, 1945. Damascus is dusty and windy and particularly unpleasant during the draught season. Cars honk a lot. It's just as noisy here as in Tripoli. But people's faces are welcoming, and they treat each other gently, with ease. Men, women, children, elders, they stare at me candidly without trying to hide their curiosity. Some look at me and smile. In their favor, one can say that Damascus aridity is of a beautiful kind. The people are radiant, kind and friendly. We arrive in Palmyra at half past five. Palmyra is a green oasis. That is likely to be the reason for its establishing. It is well know for its Roman ruins. The houses are brown, made of mud. I go out to see the ruins of Palmyra. Fortresses and columns left behind in the vast desert, remains of disintegrated mountains. I thought it was foggy but I was wrong. It was dust from the sand. Thin sand floating in the air. Carried by strong winds. Looking closely at the sky you see there aren't any clouds, a clear sky must be hiding behind all this dust. I head to Aleppo. I saw two sheep trying to climb to the hilltop. But they lacked the strength to climb. I was watching them, and I knew those sheep were my father and my mother. "I must help them," I thought. So? I am hearing something. Do you notice the sound emanating from the mountain? It's producing a sound. With the wind. The sound of the mountain. The tea is lovely. Such pleasant wind. Autumn has come. It cannot be clearly seen, The sound of the wind tells, a surprise it is... This is a very old song. It's nearly a thousand years old. The beginning of Autumn isn't visible to the eye. but you're surprised by the sound of the wind... that's what it means. There's a sound coming from the mountain, isn't there? Yes, especially now that the winds have changed. Before leaving Japan I was very interested in these types of spaces. However, these cities don't excite me anymore. A great number of them seem to want to secure a certain number of operations in order to justify a mechanized society. Yet, something is missing. Even if these economic and technical operations are in place it seems that something has been forgotten or omitted. What is lacking? Passion. The desire of a man made of flesh and bone, man's animal desires. Maybe all this traveling has got me loosing my mind. At the lodging, I take a quick shower and shave, I trim my mustache and my hair. All modesty aside, I actually looked quite cute. Mexican style. My car travel comes to an end. I drove through Europe, the North of Africa, the Near and the Middle East. All in all, about 35,000 km. I was at the brink of death, and perhaps that's why I now feel an immense sense of joy and gratitude for making it to the end safe and sound. At this point, I felt quite attached to the car. And in the end I was sad to leave him in a parking lot. You were a magnificent car. You are old, and dirty and wounded, but I owe you a lot, dear Taunus. I call Okazaki. He will pick me up at half past eight. We drive to his house in a beautiful red Sedan. Here they have free roads in all directions. They're called freeways. The country seems to have been designed for cars. I haven't slept in thirty hours, so I feel tired. America is different from Europe. It seems to be more liberal and free. I was out to work on the first garden, but the owner wasn't there. So I went to another house where I picked out weeds from the front yard. Gardening is quite demanding. My joints hurt. I hadn't done any physical work in a long time and felt somewhat stuck. In L.A. you can always find a big group of people from different ethnicities. I find myself thinking of Japan's racial homogeneity as a rare kind of universe. It's been ten months since I left Japan. I've been thinking a lot about my future. Today we're hosting a film screening. People are spread out on the carpets. At some point, they start rolling joints, and later they start passing around pipes. "So this is what they call a marijuana party..." As this thought came into my mind, I became entranced by the music. They all looked like mute rocks, drunk by music and weed. Once the film was over everyone started to leave. Eleven in the evening. We're having dinner at Mike's house. His mother is about fifty years of age. She's taller than her husband, and has good taste. She welcomes me with a hug. She seems very happy to have her son at home. It's hard to understand when they speak to each other. His mother has cooked a steak the size of a foot. I start feeling weird. Everything goes dark and out of focus. I don't want to talk, nor see... ...nor listen. I'm strangely inert. I start laughing by myself... It's hard to keep up with this laughter. I feel good. I feel my legs escaping my body and words sluggishly coming out of my mouth. I have only just met Mike's mother. I'm embarrassed about the situation. In addition to this, she showed me her indoor garden, that she loves, an oriental garden conceived by a Japanese designer. And I told her I thought I could do much better than that... I think she was a little upset. I could've expressed myself in other words. During the afternoon I was arranging for plane tickets with Okazaki. Boarding is at nine in the morning, a Pan American plane, destination Tokyo. In Honolulu we waited for the plane to be refueled. I said goodbye to Okazaki. The plane took off again. Japan is closer at every moment. My dearly missed Japan. It's been eleven months since I last saw you. The plane starts its descent. This image moves me. Yet, strangely, as we get closer to Haneda Airport, I feel anxious. I don't want to die now... ...please don't fall. The plane lands smoothly. Later I understood that the time of a man's death is predetermined, so there is no need to be afraid. This trip came to an end forty six years ago, I say I've seen the world, but what I saw was only a very small part of it. I was indeed able to build my own perspective of the world... I feel that many things are left unwritten. But I'm out of paper, and out of time to write them. Though I can't call this a conclusion, the time has come to put down the feather.
