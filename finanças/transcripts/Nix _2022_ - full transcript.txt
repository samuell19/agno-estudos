Did you call for me, honey? No, Mom. Huh, you're up early, kiddo. What can I get you for breakfast? Chocolate chip pancakes. You got it, love bug. And for the tracks, do you think I'll win. No, you won't. Because there's no finish line, how can you win? You just gotta make your own. I win! What's wrong? I had another nightmare. Kids, get dressed. We're leaving in 20 minutes. Grab your things. Don't forget our baseball stuff. Please, don't kill me! Don't hurt me! Please! Open the door! Please! Lucas, what are you doing to her? I hate you! I'm telling Mom and Dad. Mom, the camera. Oh, here you go, hon. Thanks. Remember when we went camping on our second date? Hey, Dad. Hey, Champ. Hey, you guys wanna know what bears call people in sleeping bags? What? Soft tacos. Stop it. I don't get it. He means the bears are gonna eat us. Lucas, leave your sister alone. Mom! I wanted to hit some high pops today, but it's raining. Oh, sweetie, no, the rain's gonna clear, okay. I promise. Where's my hug. I love you, Mom. I love you too, sweetie. Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas! Now batting, Lucas Coyle! The crowd goes wild! Hey! Shut up. Tessa, get the ball. What are you, scared? Get the ball. No, you threw the ball. Go get it. Get the ball! Stop being a jerk. Tessa! Hey, kids, time to eat! We want food, we want food, we want food! Rich, how long till the burgers? Give me about five, hon. Now, Jack, it's important to marinate the ketchup with the onions. So, the secret ingredient, is sharp cheddar cheese. And you put it all on an English muffin instead of a bun. - Hey, honey? - Yeah? Looks like it might storm. We might have to head back tonight. No, I think we'll be all right. Think so? - Dad? - What? Look, someone's watching us. Hey. Hello. What are you doing over there? Who was that? It was just someone lost. Nothing to worry about. Where's Tessa? Where's Tessa? Tessa? Tessa. Hey, Tessa! - Tessa. - Tessa! You guys stay here in case she comes back. Okay. It's okay. Out! Oh, hi. What's your name? Out. My name's Tessa. I just need to get my ball. Out! It'll just take a minute. Tessa! You boys stay here, okay, don't move! Okay. Help! Tessa! No! I hate you! I'm telling Mom and Dad! Monsters are real! You almost done, Jack? Just about. Huh, it's a shame you never had a chance to work those old film projection platters. They spin round and round, and you had to know exactly when to switch the next platter from a little pop in the corner of the screen in between. It was a beautiful bit of business when you got it right. Now you got buttons you push on and off. There's no human element anymore. Are you sure you haven't reconsidered selling this place? Na, it's done. This place is a relic now anyway. Asked me if I'm on drugs. I said, it's none of your business. Then I. Lucas! Lucas! Now batting, Lucas Coyle! Hey, Mom, I got dinner. Chicken that you like. Fried? Grilled. Lucas. I told you, I brought dinner. Lucas. Luke, where are you? Lucas. Lucas, where are you? What the hell are you doing? You still haven't fixed that? No, I will, all right? It's been six months. How have you not done this? What else do you do? I said I'll fix it. Oh, I bought you dinner. I'm not hungry. I know. I saw the mess you left on the counter. You know what tomorrow is, right? Yes. It means a lot to Mom. And Zoey'll be there? Your daughter. So there are a lotta different species that have parasites. You have humans, animals, plant life, you know, those sorta things. Right, but why doesn't it just kill the host? Well, the relationship between the two is a version of symbiosis. I mean, in some ways, both need each other to stay alive. It becomes mutualistic and benign. See, that's where I just get confused. That's okay. Oh, we're gonna miss you, by the way. Aw, thank you, Riley. Yeah. I think he's got a crush on you. Oh, stop. Give me that. Okay. You're up early, kiddo. What can I get you for breakfast? Chocolate chip pancakes. You got it, love bug. Amherst Bay, huh? It's nothing too fancy. Got a big backyard. That's pretty cool. Yeah. Maybe I'll get a dog, name her Rizzo. You sure you don't wanna come? I don't know. You're not their babysitter, Jack. They're grownups. One day, you're gonna have to start living your own life. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know you don't like to talk about it. No, it's okay. I came here to congratulate you. This is crazy you're gonna be a vice principal. I know. I know, ah. I got something for you. Oh boy. Oh my God. Crazy, right? Wow, I remember this. Yeah. You weren't going, and my boyfriend dumped me so he could take Debbie Shell horn. And then you stepped up. What is it? Why are we just friends? Tell me again. Look, you don't have to come tonight if you don't want to. Is that why you brought me coffee? No, I just hate pulling you into my family's drama. You are not pulling me in. And I'm not afraid of them either. Oh my God. This is, wow, I can't believe you kept this. Had to. I. I decided Zoey can stay in this room till Tessa comes back. Okay. Hey, Uncle Jack. Hey, Zoey, how's it going? Good, where's Dad? He wasn't feeling good, but he'll be back at the house. How was school? Okay. - Just okay? - Mm-hm. All right. Why don't you give me a minute, okay? I wanna talk to Mom. So Lucas decided not to show up again, huh? Typical. Listen, I know we decided on just this weekend originally, but is there any way that, um? There's this whole shit show going on at work with his girl, man, fucking bitch. Can you, um, look, I don't know about Monday. Shouldn't you be asking her father? Oh cut the shit, Jack, we all know that you're the one who makes the decisions around here. It's not like he responds to me anyway. Can you at least pretend to be her mother? Can't you see what you're putting her through? She wasn't my idea. Look, I'll come get her on Wednesday, okay? Is that good? She likes being with you. And your mom would like to have her. Right, Zoey? What? Hey, any chance I could get like 10 bucks for gas back? I'm on empty, and I don't get paid till next Friday. Take it. Thanks. Okay, bye. You're the best. King Jack! You all right? Mm-hm. Okay, Zoey, come on over here. You can blow out the candle this year. Are you sure? Yes, come on. Okay. I'm gonna sing a little song, then you blow it out. Okay. Okay. Yay! Okay. Okay. I'm gonna cut the cake now. I know everybody wants a slice. No no, where are you going, Lucas? Hey, no, no no. Everybody has to stay and have a piece of cake. Ugh. You know, I ask for one thing every damn year. Why can't I have that? It's been 25 years, Mom. We're still celebrating Tessa's eighth birthday? We don't even celebrate our own birthdays. We don't even celebrate Zoey's, and she's still alive! We celebrate Tessa's birthday because she's not here. And we owe here that! We don't owe her anything! Oh. Oh. Tessa's cake. Oh. Oh. You. - You! - Hey, Mom! - You! - Stop it! Stop, Mom. Mom, stop it! Tessa is dead! Dad's dead. They're both fucking dead. No! You're wrong! She's coming back. She just disappeared. She's still out there. Not in front of Zoey, please. If both of you had supported me, if both of you had listened to me, if you'd both been better big brothers and taken care of your sister, maybe she'd be here now and not out there wondering where her mother is! We could never have a nice time with you. What do you want? What do you want from me! Do you want me to say I'm sorry, again? Maybe you both have lost faith, but I haven't. She is out there. And she's coming back. Get out. Just get outta here. Get outta my house! I want all your stuff outta here by the morning! Done. Good! No! What? Uh. Are you okay? I don't like it when you and Grandma yell at each other. I don't like it either. Why does she keep saying Aunt Tessa's coming back? I don't understand. Hey, good news. You don't have to sleep on the couch anymore. Really? It's Tessa's old room actually. I helped Grandma clean it out. Do you want some? Thank you, Princess. This is for you. That was Tessa's. I think you should have it. Thank you. It's pretty. I love you. You know that, right? I love you too, Dad. Demonstration. You are gonna be red. I'm gonna be black. So if I roll the die, I get a two. So, basically... Your opponent across from you. Mom? You okay? Yeah, it's just your brother. He ruins everything. How many years are we gonna do this? We've searched everywhere. So have the police. We've hired private investigators. We've spent money we don't have. We've exhausted everything. It's time we move on. We all know what happened out there, Mom. And you're the only one who hasn't accepted it. You don't understand the truth. It was your fault! No. Now, it wants you. Go away! Lucas, please! Open the door! Lucas, what are you doing to her! I hate you! I'm telling Mom and Dad! It's okay, Lucas, come in. Tessa, is that, is that you? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I've been waiting for you, Lucas. Do you want to hit some high pops? It wasn't my fault! It wasn't my fault! It wasn't my fault! Lucas. Lucas! Lucas! Thank you so much for being here today, so that we may share in the life of Lucas Coyle. Whenever I'm called upon to speak at a time like this, I'm often directed to the words of Moses, specifically, Psalm 90. Teach us to number our days that we may gain a heart of wisdom. Teach us to number our days so that we may gain a heart of wisdom. I'm so sorry for your loss, Jack. If there's anything you need, let me know. Are you thirsty? You look like your father in that suit. I don't wanna do this. All these people, looking at me, judging me, like what kinda mother would let her son get to that point? No one thinks that. I wanna spread his ashes. What's he doing here? Just say hi, Mom. I'm gonna go wait in the car. We need to wait till everyone leaves, Mom. Jack. Really happy you came. Lucas meant the world to me. I know. Did you know that we've been talking the last couple months? Really? It was a big step for him to reach out. I thought he was finally getting it. Even came to a few meetings. I didn't know that. Listen, when you're ready to talk, you know where to find me. I will. Thank you. I love you, Jack. Love you too. Has the family had time to say their final farewells? Yeah, okay. Zoey! What's wrong? Are you okay? Zoey, honey, are you... There's something in there with Daddy! Uncle Jack, please don't! It was nothing, Zoey. It's okay. We're here for you, sweetie. Okay? Here, come here, baby, sh. Say hi to your mama. How did he look? You could have come in. Don't do too well at these things. Sometimes you have to do things you don't wanna do. I know, I know. Hey, baby. Look, I'm sorry I'm late. I had to stop somewhere because I wanted to get you this. Hey, Steff, let's bounce. Let's go. Give us a second. So sorry about your brother, man. No, not you. Jack, can you, um? I'm obviously going through a really rough time right now, and can Zoey... I need you to take her. You're seriously leaving right now? I'm sorry. Bye, sweetie pie. Where are you going? Stay with your Uncle Jack for a smidge, okay. You know how your mom gets. Hey, let's go to Grandma, okay? I'm gonna take you to the car. Okay. All right, let's go. Hey, you think you can help me out a little? Anybody leave any money in those cards in there? Yeah, they did, but it's for Zoey. I just wanted to have a few friends over, you know, for a little thing to celebrate Luke. Think you could chip in for it? I'm done. Okay. Never mind. How much you get? Nothing. Nothing? Just leave me alone. What are you doing? I miss him. I miss him too. You know, when we were kids, Tessa was afraid to put her hands in the cement. So your dad did it first. He was brave, just like you. Someone's here. Mommy. Do you ever hear voices? What kind of voices? I mean voices that aren't really there. Do you? Could it be the thing that's buried in the basement? Who told you that? I heard you and my dad talk about it once. What if he's trying to tell me something? Come here. Hey. Hey, Jack. Glad you came. How you holding up? To be honest, not good. To be honest, that's natural. You're not supposed to feel good, Jack. Place looks great. Yeah. A Heritage Museum. Honor the past, just don't live in it. What's on your mind, Jack? What did you and Lucas talk about the last time you saw him? He was using. He wanted to get better for Zoey. He knew she needed him, but his demons were still too strong. How's your mother? The same. They have her on four different meds right now. I know they're making her physically sick, and none of them seem to be helping. I hate your mother's doctors. It helped at first. You really think so? I don't know. Your mother is addicted to her meds. She's my sister. I knew her before all this happened, and I've seen the wonderful person inside. I know. She won't change. But she can. It happens. People do it all the time. But she chooses not to. She replays that day over and over again. She just won't accept that Tessa and your father are gone. And with Lucas gone, I'm afraid she's gonna drift deeper and deeper until there's no reaching her. Jack, don't fall into your own loop. That would be a real tragedy. - Thanks. - Yeah, whew. So, how's Zoey doing? She's gonna stay with us for a while until Steffi gets her shit together. I can't imagine what that little girl is going through. I wanna give her some sense of normalcy, something Lucas and I never had. She just needs some guidance. That's all any of us are looking for. We're gonna spread Lucas' ashes tomorrow. It would mean a lot to me if you were there. Then I will be there. - Bye. - Bye. You all right? Are you sure this is the right place? Absolutely. Do you wanna say something? Lucas, I just want you to know that I love you, and uh, I'm sorry. Do you have the urn, sweetie? Where is it? Where's the urn? I don't know. You guys had it. I thought you had it. I didn't have it. I thought you held onto it, sweetie. All right, come on. You lost it, Jack. How could I have misplaced this? How could it just disappear? Maybe somebody took it. I don't know. Mom, please, if you see it, let me know. I'm gonna go check in the car. All right, I'll come with you. We'll be back, okay? Did Tessa really disappear out here? She did. How do you know? Well, we couldn't find her. We just lost her. Do you really think she's still out here? I do. Why didn't you continue looking for her? Zoey, do you wanna go look for Tessa with me? Where did they go? Tessa! Tessa! - Tessa! - Tessa! Tessa, where are you? Tessa! Tessa! Grandma, are you okay? My Grandma's hurt! Can you help me? I'm gonna get help. Please be okay. Mom! Zoey! Mom! Zoey! She's not here. Go back to the car. There's a gun in the trunk, under the spare tire. Jack, you're scaring me. This isn't gonna happen again. Okay, all right. Mom! Zoey! Zoey? Is that you? Mom? Mom, wake up. Are you okay? Where is Zoey? Mom! 911, what's your emergency? My mom has collapsed. She's breathing but otherwise unresponsive. Zoey, where are you? Where did you go? Zoey? Zoey? Who are you calling? Do you think she's gonna be okay? What is this? What are you doing here, Zoey? Grandma fell to the ground. This nice lady is calling for help. Hang up the phone. Where did you get this? You need, yours. Zoey, let's go. Come on, let's go. You were there that day, weren't you? Stay away from me, and stay away from my family! What is that, Uncle Jack? Go to the car. Liz is at the car. Lock the doors. Okay, lock the doors. Go! Liz, something's out there. Zoey, get in the car. Lock the door. Don't open it until I get back! What the hell was that? Is Grandma gonna be okay? She will, I promise. Don't worry. What attacked us, Uncle Jack? I don't know. I... Is it gonna come after us again? No, it won't. I shot it. So, it won't get us? No. It's gonna be okay, all right? Okay. Mr. Coyle? Mr. Coyle? How's she doing? She's doing better. She was dehydrated. That's part of the reason why she lost consciousness. What's really going on? When was the last time she saw a doctor? It was like two years ago. She doesn't like going to the doctor's. Well that's unfortunate, because her blood pressure's really low, and there are some vitals of hers that are concerning me. I don't wanna jump to any conclusions, and it's hard to tell, but she should really go see her primary doctor. Okay. We went out to spread Lucas' ashes, and my mom collapsed out in the woods. We almost lost her. And what'd the doctor say? It's what they didn't say. What aren't you telling me, Jack? Something was out there. What do you mean something? I'm not sure. I know this may sound weird. It wasn't human. I think people create monsters, real or imagined. But you know, I looked in the mirror one day, and I didn't like what I saw. And I realized if I didn't get sober, it was gonna consume me. How'd you get through it? Okay, so, there are these two bull moose, and their territories overlap. And they confronted each other one day, and they started banging heads, their thick skulls, boom, boom, over and over again. And then one of them hooked the other's antlers and broke its neck. But now, it has to drag that carcass around until it's exhausted and dies. I don't get it. People choose their burdens. And a person must choose to put that burden down before they can be free. You get it? Yeah. Good. Zoey. Zoey. Don't be afraid, Zoey. Open your eyes, sweetheart. How's my little girl doing? Mom? I need your help, Zoey. Would you be a dear and tighten this for me? Don't be afraid. It's nothing. I don't want to. I need you to do it. No! Do it now! Atta girl. Zoey, what's wrong? My mom was here, and then it took her! Who took her? The monster from the woods. Can you check on my mom tomorrow? I'm worried about her, and I wanna make sure she's okay. Sure. Can you sleep on the chair and watch over me tonight? Of course. I won't let anything bad happen to you. I love you, Uncle Jack. I love you too, Zoey. What happened? Steffi. Is she okay? She's dead. I'm so sorry. What am I gonna tell Zoey? This isn't fair to her. You have to be there for her, whatever she needs. She just lost her father. I can't tell her right away. I mean, things just aren't making sense lately. I just got Lucas' toxicology report back. I thought he might a had drugs in his system. I didn't see anything on here, except his medication. I wanna know if I'm missing something. Please take a look. Okay, um. I don't, I don't see anything. What is this right here? Phage lytic enzymes. I believe that he took his life because of something deeper. No, there's something else. This was in Lucas' room. What am I looking at? It's what I saw that night. It's what attacked us. And look, this is Lucas' handwriting. It's the word he wrote in the mirror before he took his life. What if this thing is Nix? Do you know what nix means in German? Nothing. It means nothing. You were out there that night. That was no animal, okay. This isn't nothing. Is this the rabbit hole you really wanna go down? Yes. Because there's nothing here. Hi, Uncle Jack. Hey, Zo. Did you check on my mom? Yeah. Is she okay? You're gonna stay with us for a while. She doesn't wanna say goodbye? You know how your mom is. I know. I'm okay, Uncle Jack. I want my mom to feel better. Besides, I like it here best anyway. Let's get you to bed, kiddo. Hugs. Mm-hm, good night, Grandma. I love you. I love you too. Good night. I'll see you up there. Okay. She finally did it, didn't she? Did you lock all the doors and windows? Yes, no one can get in. Not the monster from the woods? No. Not the monster in the closet? Nope. What about the one in the cellar? Not that one either. Good. I promise I won't let any of them hurt you. Promise? Promise. Now get some sleep. Night, Zoey. Good night. Hello? Hello! What are you doing, Uncle Jack? I'm proving to you that there isn't anything buried in the basement. Thought you already said there wasn't. I wanna make sure for you. Mm. Can I help? Who does that belong to? It's my dad's. Jack! What are you doing to my floor? This is unacceptable! Okay, Mom. Ugh. Ugh. So? Open it. It's all the stuff from my childhood. My dad must a put it here. What's that? It's a videotape. What does it do? It plays movies. So it's a phone? It plays videos like your phone. It's what we used when we were your age. So that's it. There's nothing in here. Sometimes our imaginations run wild. We could think of some really great things, or we can conjure up some really bad things. Sometimes, if you tell the same story over and over again, it takes on a life of its own. Like the Nix? Where did you hear that? I saw it on the mirror that day. And I heard my dad talk about it. He told me it was going to destroy us. All of us. What did you see? It doesn't matter what I saw. The important part is that we're letting our imagination get the best of us and it's not healthy. What if you're wrong? I think I have proof. I found one of my videotapes buried in the basement. All the videotapes I made when I was a kid are gone, except this one. We put our hands in the cement when I was seven. I got my video camera when I was 10. Let's find out what's on there. We want food! We want food! Okay, okay, we hear you. We want food! Rich, how long till... You marinate the ketchup with the onions and just keep stirring it around, okay. Guys, guys, wait up. Tessa, smile! Did you see that? You were dead. Jack, that's not funny. I'm not joking, see! Nothing's there. I love you, Mom. Is that Tessa? I hear her voice. No, Mom, Liz is here. Hi, Mrs. Coyle. Good night. I don't know what to believe. I don't know what's real. I don't know what to do with my mom or how to help Zoey. I need to find the truth. Stop, stop! Why are you doing this to yourself? There are answers on this tape and out in the woods. Lucas knew what this thing was! It took his life! If something happens to you, who's gonna watch after Zoey? I have to go out there. Careful. Please. Hey, Jack, come and find me! Hey, Champ, you guys wanna know what... What? Stay where you are. Don't come back. They're all dead. The secret ingredient is sharp cheddar cheese. And then you put it on an English muffin... - Dad. - Dad. Someone's watching us. Hello? What are you doing over there? Mister, are you lost? Yeah, sorry. Can you point me in the direction of the main road? Yeah, sure. It's right over there. You guys camping? Yeah. Just grilling up some burgers right now. Sharp cheddar cheese is the secret ingredient. And you put it all on an English muffin instead of a bun. You're a good man. I see you have a nice family. You should enjoy your time with them. They're actually pretty rowdy. But I love them. How about you? Got any kids? No. Well, uh, one, sort of. Hm. Well, you take good care of her. I better get back. Safe travels, Champ. Bye, Dad. Love you. Who was that? Just someone who was lost. Nothing to worry about. Dad! Dad! Tessa is going into the pond! Help her! - Save her, Dad, help her! - Dad, save her! Tessa! Tessa! No. Tessa! I saw it. I saw all of it. Did you find what you were looking for? But did you talk to the old woman first? Then it's not inside you yet. You need to go talk to her. Would you like some hot cocoa und some marshmallows? Why am I here? Who are you? I explain. My life pain, come from Fatherland, old country. Brought Nix here to drown. Keep it from ones I love. But it found you. Your family. Your pain now. You're not real. You don't see. Only darkness. In order to see, you first have to open your eyes. Hey, Jack. Lucas? I wanna show you something. Come on. Tessa and I are gonna hit some high pops. It's okay, Jack. Come in. Save Zoey. Who are you? You've taken everything from us! I don't understand. What else do you want? Tessa, are you awake? Hm. Oh. We're gonna go camping tomorrow. Have fun just like the old days. Oh. I love you so much, my little princess. Tessa! Tessa! Tessa! Richard! Tessa! Richard! Why didn't you help her? I couldn't find her, honey! She's not there! Richard. Richard. I'm sorry. I tried to save her. You didn't try hard enough. I looked and I looked and I... Shut up, Richard! This is your fault. She's dead because of you. You were supposed to be watching her! Get off of him! You're gonna kill him! What the fuck are you doing? Stop! Donna? Donna? Donna, are you home? Oh for God sake. Donna, come on! How'd you get in here? You left the front door wide open. You can't be doing stuff like that. I'm so sorry. I'll never do that again. Jack came to see me. Well that's unfortunate. He's worried about you, Donna. Everybody's worried about me, and it's pretty annoying. Just leave me alone. We're trying to help you. You've gotta get off the meds. All those pills, you know that's not healthy. What should I be on, Doctor? Oh, oh, wait, I forgot. I'm supposed to be positive, aren't I? Because everything's just peachy keen. You know, I loved Lucas like he was my own. Well he wasn't. You don't have a clue about what it's like to lose a child. I do know, Donna. Because I buried Lucas too. Ha! But who do I bury next? You or Jack, or maybe Zoey? Oh. Just, get outta my house. Now! Mom? Now my little princess, would you like to dance? How about you? What the fuck is this? Don't be so dramatic. Be polite. Say hello to your sister. It left me in the woods. You'll feel different when it's in you. It doesn't want you. Maybe you're dying like me. No more lies. No more tricks. I saw what you did to Dad. Say what happened out there. I'm sick, Jack. I've been sick for a very long time. That's the one good purpose it served. It kept me alive. Where is it going? You and Lucas weren't enough. There's only one left. And she's upstairs. No! You stay with me, Jack! You stay with me! Mother needs you. Get away from her! What are you doing? Where is she? What'd you do with her? She's not here. I know she's here. She's hiding. Come on out, Tessa. Don't be afraid. Jack, I missed you! I love you, Jack. Ah! Oh, ah, ah! Mom? You can't have her. Neither can the Nix. This thing has been inside of you, feeding off of you. It needs you just as much as you need it. Open your eyes, Mom! Open them! I... I didn't want to hurt you or Lucas. I'm sorry, Jack. I... Oh. I wish... I could have been a better mother for you. I needed you. I needed a mother. Stop staring at me! Stop judging me! Stop treating me like a monster! Get away from me! You're not my son. You're nothing! Oh. I... Take me to the pond. It's where I belong. It's where it belongs. I don't think it's gonna stay in me for very long. And if it escapes, it's just going to find someone else. You need help. It's too late for me. But it's not too late for you and Zoey. Mom. Please, I have to be with Tessa one last time. I know Tessa died there. I know that now. But I'm still here, Mom. Which is why this is our only choice. Please. I could never be the mother you wanted. But you were always the son I needed. I love you. I'm ready. Oh, you look beautiful, my little princess. I love you, Mom. Aw. I love you too, my Tessa. Well those are two easy. How about that one? Elk. Okay, okay. Okay. - Okay that one, behind you. - I'm ready. Uh, deer. It's a cari-boo! You got it wrong. You did not pass the test. I did. I did. I got it wrong. I'm gonna go talk to your uncle for a second. You okay? Yeah. All right. I wanna thank you for everything. I appreciate you taking care of Zoey last night. Of course. She needed to be out of that house. I'm sorry, for everything I've put you through. I'm just... I'm just glad you're okay. I haven't been acting like myself lately. So, did you find what you were looking for? Honestly... Come here. Come on. Hey. Uncle Jack, you're here! I missed you. Are you hungry? You can have my pancakes. Thank you, Zoey. Wow, so, I guess this is goodbye. I guess so. Why can't we just go with Liz? Sweetie, you guys can come and visit me anytime that you want. I have something to tell you. What? I lied. About what? I wasn't ready to say goodbye to my dad. It's okay, Zoey. You're not mad? No. When you're ready to say goodbye, you'll know. Yeah. Why don't we go with Liz to her place? Stay there for a while, see how it goes? Really? Really. I would love that. Would you like that? Guess what? What? Liz thought that that animal right there was a deer, but it is a caribou. A caribou? A caribou. Obviously. It was obvious. I was wrong. What am I gonna do? You want some coffee or something? Wanna check it out? Can I get ice cream? You know, I think that we can manage that.
