But, uh, these two girls have great hair and great teeth, and, um, it's a good family. These are two of the luckiest people you've ever seen sitting right in front of you. To ... to Luke and Alison. Yes. How do you follow that? Um, an ancient Celtic wedding ritual involved tying the bride and groom's wrists together while they each took turns reciting vows to be engaged for exactly a year and a day. And at the end of this year-and-a-day promise, they can choose to part without obligation, or they could choose to repeat their vows and spend eternity together. Because this ceremony involves tying the bride and groom's wrists together, that's where the term "tying the knot" comes from. After mason introduced Luke to my little sister, I knew they didn't need a year and a day. From the first moment they met, they knew that they would spend eternity together. So... I love you guys. Congratulations. To Luke and Alison. Oh, come here! come here ! Come here! Oh, my god! I'm married! To me. To me. Okay, okay, okay. Have a good time. She's mine! Take care of my sister.

I was hoping you would pick up and tell me what to do. but you're not answering, so anyway, I love you. Bye. Can Olivia come out and play? A few years ago, I was in new Orleans with some girlfriends. And we were drinking and dancing and going crazy. And there was this really cute guy, and he was dancing with me all night. And we were outside, and it started raining. Everybody was scrambling for cover. Jello shots! And this guy looks me straight in the eye and he bent down to kiss me, and I totally freaked out because I had a boyfriend. And I left. I went to find my girlfriend. Later on that night, I got a call from Mason, and he told me that he just hooked up with our friend Valerie. So, what did you do? It was hard. We were really confused. I was upset. I didn't know if we should break up or not. But then I didn't know if I was just more upset that I didn't kiss that guy in new Orleans. So, after I came home, we talked and we fought and we cried and we stayed up all night. And we realized that we were gonna stay together and not break up and just see what happens, you know, and just be honest with each other about how we feel and what we do. So, how's that working out?

I went into the doctor for my yearly exam, and, I don't know, I guess he caught it before I did. I was on antibiotics a few weeks ago. So is it mine, then? I don't know. Maybe. are you gonna keep it? I'm not asking you for anything. I don't know. Part of me does want to keep it. Are you serious? I got to go. Yeah. Maybe that's a good idea. Yeah. ♪ I'm so good at sex ♪ ♪ I'm so good at sex ♪ hey, Luke, what's up? Hey, douche. I'm coming over. I'm sleeping, man. Where are you? No. No, don't come by. I-I got to get more sleep. Ooh, yeah.

You are trouble, Young lady. Mmm. Mmm. I had a lot of fun last night. I had a lot of fun last night. Really? I'm the lucky one. You make me feel like a teenager again. Oh, god. Aw.

Please. For me? Okay. All right. You promise? I won't tell her. Yeah, I promise. Swear? I swear. Do you pinkie-swear? No. Come on. You got to pinkie-swear. Yeah, I pinkie-swear. All right. Mmm. Hey, thank you. I can't believe you invited James. Well, we invited him and Brooke, but Brooke couldn't make it. I can just uninvite him. No. What's the problem with that? You guys are friends now. We are friends now. I just wish you would've told me that he was coming. It's not a big deal. Forget about it. What's going on with you? You've been edgy all night. I'm busy. I've been working a lot. You've been acting funny for a while. Is there something you're not telling me? Uh, no. Are you having an affair on Mason? Oh, my god. 'Cause you'd tell me if you were, right? I'm your sister. You can tell me anything. Thank you. You know, I don't understand Why you and Mason don't get married. Honestly. Someone's gonna steal him away. Jesus. Come on! I made this myself. Sorry. What are you doing? Fuck. Thanks, Olivia. Mm-hmm. Nachos. Hot. All right. Okay. Well, be Nice to it. All right. I'm gonna go get my chips. Weighted, casino-quality chips, 'cause I'm fucking neurotic.

What are you doing here? Um, I brought beer. Great. Thanks. Um, come on in. Thanks. Wow. Is that a handmade table? Fuck, yeah, it's handmade. Okay, I officially have no idea what I'm doing. But the good news is I do have a 69. Okay. Might as well fold, 'cause you told everybody what you got. So just... Whatever. So, how are things going between you and Brooke? I'm in. yeah, uh, they're ... not very well. I'm in. I don't think she's that interested in me. Oh, that's too bad. She could really use a guy like you. I raise! Could you wait your turn? I haven't even gone yet. You're gonna be out of the game if you keep playing like this. Really? I'm sure you'll have no trouble finding a nice girl. Oh, thank you, but, uh, best ones are always taken. Uh, you okay? Why are you drinking water anyway? Have a fucking beer. Loosen up. She's a deadbeat. Deadbeat. All-in. Oh, fucking seriously, You better have a full house or something. She's bluffing. I'm in. All right. Me too. Let's see 'em, punk-ass. Two pair. Read 'em and weep. Three queens. Ah! Yeah, well, let me show you guy show to really play some poker. Ow! I feel good! Nice! Girls, baby. has a full house. Doesn't even know what kind of hand she has. You are quite the hustler, you know that? Um, I think I deserve another beer for winning. Why haven't you returned my phone calls? That's the point. You don't even know how to play poker. Sweetie, is this a good hand? Just fold, baby. I'm staying in. Fine, I call. I raise. Come on! So, how do you like being married to my gay brother? She fucking loves it. I love being married. Do you love being married? Yeah. Yeah, actually, I do. You better love it. How about you? You got a boyfriend? Well, actually, There's this one guy. Yeah, he's really cute. I really like him, but I don't ... I don't know. What don't you know? Come on. Well, he's way older. Oh, no. I know. Right? And ... but he also is kind of dating someone, and he totally had sex with my best friend. Oh, my god. Best friends having sex? Not your best friend anymore. Whatever. You know, I think this guy sounds like bad news ... like, real bad news. Yeah, I know, but the thing is that I've just liked him forever. And not only is he a hot kisser, but he has a Jesus penis, and you know what that means. Okay! Jesus penis? You know what that means! what does "a Jesus penis" mean? Oh, you know, it's perfect, it's large. conversation's over. Let's play poker ...the reason we came here. I'll, uh ... I'll raise. And I will, uh, call. Yeah, I-I think you might be able to do a little better. Just sounds like he's a little immature. I don't think it sounds like he's immature at all. He's apparently got a legendary penis. I say, go for it. I mean, he sounds like a fucking stud. Are you kidding me? No, I'm not kidding you. Could you guys fucking shut up? The more I hear about this, it's making me sick to my stomach. Go get another beer. Yes! Thank you. Olivia, you're only Young once, all right? Go get on that penis. No, no, no, no, no. Honey, honey, good things come to those who wait. I promise you. I mean, look at you and Samantha. You guys are, like, the perfect couple. You look cute and successful and in love. Can we just play poker, please? Well, I don't understand why you don't just propose to her. It's easy. Yeah, why don't you marry Sam, Mason? Poker, poker, poker. All right, is anybody still playing this game? Look, all-in. All-in? All-in, bitches. Oh, bitches? Uh, I'll go all-in. Nice. What are you gonna do, man? Sorry. When are you planning on telling him? When I have time to. There's always something going on. God damn it. You have to tell him. And you have to tell your sister. And you got to stop lying to the people who care about you. It isn't lying if you just don't mention it. That is so fucking cruel, Sam. Look, when I saw you at the wedding... And spent the night together, and I kept seeing you, I had to deal with the fact that you were in this weird relationship. But the reason that I stayed with you is because you were so open and honest and you made me feel so alive. That's why I've been trying to make this work. I care about you. I love you. I'm sorry for putting you through all this. It's okay. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner. What did you think I would say? I don't know. Were you afraid I would judge you? I just wanted you to keep looking up to me and... You were always the level-headed one, Sam ... The one who always thought everything through. I'm the one who rushed into marriage with Luke when everyone told me to wait. I'm the one everyone thought would have the first kid. God, maybe you were just jealous of me all along. Sammy? Hmm? Are you really sure you want to go through with this? I don't know. Can I even have a baby right now? I want to start a business. My life would be over. The best would be Christmas. You bring you two boyfriends and your baby to dinner, and, um, and mom will start preaching about the importance of family values. Oh, my god. Can you imagine? Ohh! So, how are you gonna tell Mason? I don't know. We used to be able to tell each other everything, and now there's just something between us. Well, you're in love with somebody else. I'm still in love with Mason. Then why can't you just talk to him? Because I know what he would say. He doesn't want kids. What if it's not his? I just don't want to hurt him. Just spit it out. Do it like a band-aid. He's a big boy. He can take it. It's harder than that. Sometimes the hardest thing to do is the right thing. Don't look at me like that. Thanks, Dr. Phil. Shut up. Have some more pie. I think you need some more pie. Come on. This is ...she's right in front of me. I got to go. Okay, bye. Sam? Jesus fucking Christ. I just got off the phone with Ali. That was quick. I'm just so happy I don't have to keep you guys a secret from her anymore. That shit was driving me crazy. Seriously, listen. Listen. If you guys need anything, you let me know. Okay? I'd make an awesome uncle. Thank you. No problem, kiddo. Well, now I should tell you, the publisher loved Mason's book, thinks it's gonna be huge. Are you serious? Yeah. So I'm gonna go in and tell him. That's great. I know. - What the fuck?! - Calm down! Luke, stop it! Luke, stop it! Leave him alone! Stop! Stop it! Stop it! Luke, stop! Stop it! Fuck you! Get off! Get your fucking clothes on! Get your fucking clothes on. How the fuck could you do this? You two are fucking sick! Treating people like toys? Hey, asshole, you fucking leave my sister alone, or I will fucking kill you. Go. Go. Ow! Luke, stop! You're hurting me! How could you bring a child into this shit?! Shut up. What are you talking about? He doesn't know? Get out. She's pregnant, asshole. Maybe if you talked to her instead of fucking my sister ... Get out! Let's go. Ow! Fuck, Luke. It's okay. Get up. Should have hit him back. Oh, you know that wouldn't have solved anything. Fuck! ow. Hold this. Why didn't you just tell me? Why didn't you just tell me about you and Olivia? I know you guys have been sleeping together for weeks. Why wouldn't you just tell me? Who else knows? About Olivia? No, about your fucking kid! What do you think? Alison... Ja... James. Oh, Jesus Christ, I'm gonna be fucking sick. Whose is it? Is it his? You know, that's fucking awesome. You're always giving me shit about using protection! You're such a hypocrite! Oh, that makes two of us! No, I'm not fucking pregnant! I don't want a kid! I never did! I don't want a kid either. Yeah, for all I know, this is exactly what you've always wanted. You are such an asshole! I really screwed things up with Luke, didn't I? You're in love with him, aren't you? Yeah. Yeah. I think I am. Oh, don't tell me you're jealous. Oh, I'm not. I'm not jealous. Then why can't we talk anymore? Because I don't want to talk! You're such a fucking child. You're such a fucking child! Fuck you. Fuck you! Okay, here's my plan. A big fucking push ... 50 cities, TV appearances, "Leno," "Letterman," and I think I can get you on "Oprah." Sounds good? Sounds good. Yeah, it sounds good! It sounds fucking great! But you've got to come to L.A., darling, even though you are probably the King of this town, aren't you? Yeah. So many gorgeous girls. God, look at you two, so cute, all dressed up like real men. My son Keaton is about your age. I can't get him to tie his fucking shoes, much less write a book or manage or whatever you do. I don't know. He just can't settle down. I guess life's just a shitload of fun when you're up to your neck in poontang. Okay, we've got work to do, darling. Why don't you have your undertaker go down to the lobby for a few minutes? We'll need our privacy. Katherine. Pleasure, as always. Till next time. What is his fucking problem? Geesh. Katherine, I got to go. I'm sorry. I'll be ...I'll be back. Do not keep me waiting. Okay. Okay. See ya. Luke, come on! Hold up! Give me a second. Soon as this fucking deal goes through, I'm no longer your manager. Bullshit. I can't fucking work with you anymore. I can't be friends with you anymore. That's it. All right. I said I was sorry. I apologized. I fucked up. What do you want me to say? I don't fucking believe you. I can't trust you. I'm done. Olivia's an adult, okay? She knows what she's getting shut your fucking ... just shut your fucking mouth. Don't... God damn it, why'd you fucking do it? Of all the people in the world you could've fucked around with, my little sister? You ... What the fuck were you thinking? We were bros. You were my best fucking friend. We're still bros. We're fucking not. I lied for you. I lied to my wife for you, and this is how you fucking repay me? I know Olivia only fucked you to get at me, but it doesn't change the fact that you still did it. You're not a good guy, man. You're not. You use people. You exploit their lives for your trashy novels. I used to think I was doing you a favor, helping you sell that shit, but it turns out you were just using me like you fucking use everyone. That is not true. Ali told me the only reason Sam stays with you is out of pity. You know that? Fuck you. You're like a charity case for her. Who else would stay with such an ineffectual fuck? You don't even have the balls to commit to the one person who can tolerate you. Better get back. Don't want to miss your date.

Why were you kissing him? Oh, I always hook up with Jeremy. It doesn't mean anything. Oh, my god. Did you think you were, like, the only one? Did you think we were, like, "going steady" or something? You don't know what you're doing. Well, isn't this what you and Sam do ... have fun, hook up with other people? I can't believe you're jealous. What a fucking double standard. Shut up. My head is fucking killing me. Stop laughing. Okay. Oh, god, Mason. Luke swore he'd tell my parents If he found out that we were still seeing each other. I know my parents would freak out and make me move back home. Besides, my girls told me that I shouldn't be seeing you anyway, because you're gonna be a dad soon. I mean, you can't have a girlfriend, a kid, and me. Besides, that's kind of weird, dating a dad. Uurgh... I'll leave her. I'll leave her for you. Oh, Jesus. If that's what you want I will. Oh, mason, seriously. You would be nothing without her. But...I love you. I love you, too, but I'm not in love with you. And I don't want a boyfriend. Are you dumping me? God, Mason, Why do you have to be so serious all the time? It's not like you could really call this dating. And the other day, I was in the park, watching these kids play, and I just started crying out of nowhere. Can you believe that? I never cry. What the hell is wrong with me? You've got some crazy decisions to make. why does life have to be so fucking complicated? Because sometimes love just isn't enough.

Shots ... shots, and then I got a story. All right. You know what they call this guy? Do you know why they call this guy "Boner Baxter"? Aw, shit. When this guy was in college, the middle of the night ... No, no, if you're gonna tell it, you got to tell it the right way. I am telling it the right way, okay? I'm a writer, all right? I'm an important writer. Sit down! So, fire alarm goes off, right? And there are all these horny ...horny dudes ambling around, you know, trying to get a look at these little girls with their skimpy little pyjamas. And smack-dab in the middle of this hormonal fray is this one lone gunslinger with this big, bulging fucking ramrod just sticking out for all the world to see. It wasn't ... I wasn't exposed. It was ... I had silk boxers on, and it's a natural occurrence. Ladies and gentlemen ,the legend of boner Baxter! It's a blessing and a curse. You know ...you know what your problem Is? No. What? You're so traditional. You always do exactly what you think you're supposed to do. Well, at least my life isn't scattered. You will never really be in love, because you will never be satisfied with anyone. You want too much. I bet ... I bet ... I bet your plan is to be married by 30. Well, I used to think that ... married at 30, mistress at 40, Porsche at 50, retired at 60, and then ... What a fucking life. Cheers to that. Cheers to that. You know... You are scared to death of marriage. You feel trapped by it. Whoa. Thank you, Jesus, for coming into this room right now and explaining my fucking life to me. Who made you Sigmund fucking Freud, huh? What ... how do you know anything about me? When did ... when did the therapist walk into the bar? I missed that. Um, I think about three beers ago. Thank you. I-I really appreciate that, man, coming from, you know, wise James over here. Jesus Christ. Yes. All of those names apply. You're just ... you're not very open-minded, is the problem. You're right, but I... I am working on that. Working on it? Yeah. But you know what I am? I am a realist. What does that even mean? It means that you live in fucking fantasyland. Fantasyland? What the fuck is fantasy... is that a strip club? The life you live ... the life you are living does not function in this society. No. you're wrong. You're wrong on this one. Am I right? You guys are fucking assholes. Guys just want to get laid. No, see that's not always true. mm-hmm. Because I love her. I really do. And this is fucking weird, because you're her boyfriend. And I'm telling you this, and we're not hitting each other. Yeah, well, I'm not so good in fights. I got your back, Amigo. So, what are we gonna do, Mason? I don't know, man. I got no fucking idea. Mason? Are you here? What are you doing? It was supposed to be you and me against the world, Sam. What happened? What were you looking for? I just... I love you so much. I love you. You're ... you're my everything. I love you, too. Marry me. Oh, Mason. I've had it for years. I-I don't know why I never gave it to you. I'm sorry. I just... What do you say? You know how I feel about marriage. Yeah, well, you know how I feel about kids, but I'm still here. I just ... I want to make you happy. I'm gonna quit drinking, okay? I promise. A-and I'll never see her again. I'll never see any of them again, and you can ... you can see James if you want. I don't care. Y-You can... Please, can we start over? please? Do you really want me to tell you the truth? Um... No. No. Okay. Sure. We can get married. And we can have a bed that's big enough for you and me and James and the baby. And we can even throw Olivia in there if you want. We'll all live happily ever after, and it'll be fun. It's not your kid, Mason. It's his. Are you relieved? Maybe. I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. "And that final night, as we lay together, "I came to realize that she didn't need me anymore. "I was the one that needed her, the one that needed all of them.
