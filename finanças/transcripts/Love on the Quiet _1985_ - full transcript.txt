Where are we'? And Martine? Where's Martine? I fell asleep at her place. We'll replace her. And where will I sleep now'? On my couch if you like. No, no. What shall we do'? Let's go to George. What time is it'? Time for a coffee. You'll wake up the whole hotel. And the little girl! You won't have a Valium somewhere'? I'd prefer 2 eggs. May I'? A drunkard, a freeloader, a sex maniac and a Negro. What friends! Yes... You're right, I'll leave them to you. I'll turn in. It gets worse, huh'? I didn't think he'd take so serious. Did he tell you'? No, no. But Josyane told me. Well'? Well, he took her home. - His wife wasn't there'? - No. She had to go to Marseille. When she came there, her wholesaler didn't show up. Well, she returned to Aix, and we have... the catastrophe. No, come on, it won't work. What's going on'? It's just occupational medicine. Of course! Jeanne! - She left? - Yes. She didn't take anything. I think they should wait before meeting again. Marc, my husband. Antoine. Croissants? Antoine has bought them. Are these your things in the entrance'? - Antoine Garnier. - Delmas. Please sit. We took the bedroom. You can sleep on the office couch. Alright. You take milk? Yes, of course. I've used milk for 8 years now. You want to talk with us? No hurry. It seems you'll stay for a while. I think so. Very good, your croissants. Really. I usually have toast, but... Excuse me. Pardon. I need to shave. I've an important meeting at 9 am. How do you like him'? Very trustworthy. He does what? Furniture. He manufactures Italian furniture branded as La Ciotat. A business tycoon. I like it. Why'? It's boring to share your bath with a small business owner. It won't be for a long, Marc. The trial is at November 28. Do you have a lawyer? No. I was wondering if you could... Oh no, no. We're friends. But thank you. Bonjour Jacques. We've received a telex from a certain Mobutu Noritou. No. Mahorou Mobitu. We were in college together. - Will be in the office tomorrow'? We must talk. - Yes, sir. Two bouquets, please. They're for Jeanne. Wait. I've got heather and anemones inside. I know she loves heather and anemones. Josyane, I'm sorry for the other day. Not as much as I am. Right? - There's no problem any more. I'll move to a hotel. - I don't care. Listen Josyane... And thanks for the flowers and the kind words. Well-mannered guys are rare nowadays. Oh, Marc... Ciao. - I smell it's the 4, there. - It's is not the 4. Come on, it's your turn. I pass. - Yam. - Bastard! - Oh, come on! - Pure luck. M. Georges suggests No. 14. It's darkish, good for the court. That's right, Marc. Have you met Mario'? He was bartender at George V. - Hello, Mario. - We met in Tonkin. He was cook there. I'll fix the room. Suits me well. What have you done this week'? We went to a demonstration at La Ciotat. Against the closure of the shipyards. But... H ow? - By bus. - We were even attacked by the police. You're completely crazy. Who did get you into that? The housekeeper. Her son works there. A good woman. A little leftist, obviously. But they could have busted you. How would that have looked? Quick, turn off the TV, now it's "Dynasty". Don't you like "Dynasty"? Yes, but we confuse the characters with those in "Dallas". - These are for you. - Thank you, honey. Incredible they cost 30 F nowadays. - And Jeanne, is she okay? - Yes. Still no baby? How beautiful she is. Who is it, Mario'? Veronica. Peruvian, 24. - Classy. - Her, for example, how much'? Maybe 4 or 5000. - When do I see you again? - I'll call you. Go now... Look here. Mario and his connections. A phone call, and you have her. How much'? Not my thing. Not even her'? Well. Yes. M. Marchandon? You're wanted. She's the wife of the owner of Novotel. ls the 11 available? This is not a fleabag. I mean, think of Jeanine and the little girl... And Marc'? Marc is a hotel guest. The customer is king. You should be proud. She leaves her cruise ship to sleep with him in a two-star hut. Well, come on... George! "The customer is king", huh'? Ah, there you are. I was concerned. That's kind. I've come to get my mail. Stay for dinner. Jeanne will be happy. Yes. Pardon. You come along? It's good for your breath. Congrats. I think we should have a good talk. Yes. It would be nice. Is it you, Antoine'? I'm in Milan the next two days. I'll call you when I'm back. Okay. - The quiche. - Put it in the kitchen'? - You came for that? - Yes. Antoine invited me for dinner. Without me. Jeanne's going out. So it's just the two of us. Perfect, isn't it'? No no, it's a joke. I'll leave you alone. - Well, bye. - Bye. Ah, M. Delmas. I tried to reach at the court. Mme. Lubeck has dropped her charges. And M. Ravignac asks for you. - He's alone? - Yes. Come in, Marc! I'm in Geneve around 11am. Well, let's have lunch, and talk about everything. See you tomorrow. Well, Casenave? - Canceled. - Bravo. Can you imagine to work among niggers? How so'? M. Mahorou Mobitu is Minister of Justice in Ruanda-Urundi. Didi? Great. Since when'? His cousin became prime minister after the fall of a certain M'mba Tod... They ask for a counselor. Well, I doubt... They're asking if you're interested? Me'? Large salary, one-year contract. - Could be an experience. - Yes. But Ruanda-Urundi doesn't match with my plans. Honestly, I'd be very sorry if you left us. Thank you. Tell me, Marc, may I ask you a favour? You're welcome. Well. Tomorrow, I'm in Geneve, but I had an appointment with a young friend, who passes through Marignane Airport. She's coming from Rome. I can't cancel her any more. We should spend some time together. I had something for her. Could you replace me'? But of course. Sure. How do I recognize her'? You'll recognize her. Bonsoir. - I'm taking a few shirts. - Alright. You're alone? He's in Milano. Invasive, that guy, all this stuff here... And that "Jouy", when he removes it, it will leave huge holes. Enormous. Where did you meet him'? In the shop. He asked for original versions of films. Strange, isn't it'? Great guy. Apart from jogging, what's he doing actually? You're very nice. Thank you. So you're happy? Come, sit here. Come. Antoine is reliable. When he says he's in his office, it's there he is. If he is late, he calls. If he goes to see his wife... He's married? Separated. He has two grown-up children. He tells you everything, and you him'? That's formidable. I've never lied to you. If we'd make love, would you tell him'? We'? Here right now'? Certainly. The surprise of the year. Marc, I beg you. Monsieur? Is M. Delmas here'? - May I have a word'? - Here? Rather outside, right'? Yes, yes. As you like. It went well in Milano? Jeanne has told me. Really? It shouldn't happen again. You shouldn't quarrel because of me. Ah, she told you that we quarreled? That happens between husband and wife. It's quite normal. Normal... - And, is it over now'? - Pardon'? Your argument, is it over'? You think Jeanne and me... It could have happened, but it didn't happen. Jeanne would have told you. No'? Marc, I wanted to tell you, if it make Jeanne happy I can disappear. This woman deserves a little happiness. Currently it's you who make her happy. Canceled, delayed... What's going on'? - Strike. - What strike? The aerial surveillance, M. And the flight from Rome'? Let's see.. It just landed at gate 6. Ah, thank you. Excuse me. Are you Mlle. Lepage? Yes. M. Ravignac has sent me. He couldn't tell you any more. - Really? - He asked me to give you this. Thanks. Excuse me. You're going to Paris'? There's a strike... - If I can... - Thank you, M... Delmas, I work for M. Ravignac. I forgot to introduce myself. I'm sorry. No flights before 9 pm. Won't you stay here'? I can drive you somewhere, if you want. - Know this one'? - Of course. I've never had time to finish it. Eh, I think there are better things to do. Where do you live'? I live in Aix. It's half an hour. You better go there, M. Delmas. I just wanted to tell you, I behaved like a... Like an idiot. Exactly. Have you known Ravignac for a longtime? No. Just a few months. We met at the Prado in Madrid. You're into fine arts? I was actually, but then I branched off. Into... Into some business? My Own, yes So you're... self-employed? At one point... Excuse me... When I first saw you in Marignane, don't get upset now... I was convinced that I had to do with a call girl. But I am a call girl. Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse for what? Can't I be graduated and a whore'? Not? Yes, sure. Sure... I can't talk about money, so I'll just write. Five... Voila. - Is it okay? - It's perfect. Shall we go'? You'll ask me how I got there'? People always wonder. Really? - Well, how did you get there'? - There're no rules. It was through relations. My father has an advertising agency. He promoted you'? No. Though he has promoted worse products. I started on my own. I'm independent. I like to choose my clients, as you could see. Oh, I feel honored. Even flattered actually. Thank you. You'll thank me afterward. Certainly. Wait here, I'll see what I can do. I'm sorry. Due to the ecumenical congress we are full-booked. It's not a hotel any more. They only sell apartments. Didn't you buy one'? Look at these assholes. What are they doing here'? They don't care, the French. And you? Me'? I know everything. - You're married? - Separated. Is that good or bad'? I've never asked myself that. Maybe we met too early. - And when did you meet'? - 8 years ago. I was stupid then. Have you changed since then? I won't even bother asking. Have you had this problem before'? This is the first time. Bon. Last solution: My grandmother. Voila. On Wednesdays she visits my uncle in Saint-Remy. After the death of my parents, I moved here. I was 6 then. She brought me up, together with my aunt. You learn to know a man by making love in his children's room. The awkward age. The cheeky age. Puberty. And graduation. No. Law degree. So you were late, mentally. You forget the mother's part. Anatole. Hello, Anatole. Hello, Samantha. Marc, are you here, darling? Damn, my grandmother. It's early for an aperitif. I'd like a scotch. Don't you, Mlle? For me tea, please. We had a late lunch. Really? - Where'? - At Fernand's. How daring! But Marc, you can't invite a friend for lunch into a snack bar. So true. You go there often with Jeanne? Yes. Sometimes, yes. Therese, take care of the tea, okay? You know Jeanne? Marc told me about her. You're in a hurry'? Samantha has to catch a flight. It can't wait'? I've an appointment in Paris tonight. Attention, please. Departure to Paris-Orly, Air Inter flight 7728, is boarding at gate 55. Wait. This is the last call. - Oh no. - Oh yes. - No, no. - Yes, yes. It's better. I'm sorry. No. It was nice. - Who was it'? - "Who was it" Who? The girl that Mario saw you with yesterday. Mario'? Really? - It's nothing. She's a friend. - "Friend", at what price'? Pardon'? Mario knows her. She's a hooker. So what? Don't like it'? I just thought it wasn't your thing. I thought so too. - Haven't you read it yet'? - Huge tomes always discourage me. 25 F is a nice offer. You can't miss it. - Who's the girl on the bike? - A friend. Though lady, huh'? And well placed. You've no idea how tough. Oh yeah? Oh really? Good. Good good good! Yes. We met at the Paris-Dakar. She participated. And I drove the support car. She broke her fork, and voila. So, what am I doing here'? - You like grated carrots? - Yes. I don't. But sometimes, I put myself on a diet composed of of man and vegetables. After that I feel fit. Ah, it is you, honey. But what do you think? Of course I'm alone. But no, I'm not weird. Yes, honey. See you tonight. I kiss you. - She really has antennas. - Ah yes. Some grated carrots? No. Not for me. - What are you doing here'? - You forgot to sign your check. Have a seat please. Is there mail for me'? Some flayers. And... a phone call. Well. It was... Well okay... Antoine is living here together with Jeanne. Yes, Mom. Marc and I are... Then there was Antoine. You see, I told you. You're very lucky. Jeanne is a good girl. Who was calling? - The call'? - Well. Samantha Lepage. The girl the other day'? You shall call her back. Fast, I guess. She is waiting for you over there. Leave your bag here. Is he a relative? He's the former caretaker of my grandmother. She left him the house. When my grandfather died in '47, she owned the place alone. It's over there. Further inbound. For me he's like a grandfather. I visit him frequently. Alone'? What do you think? Alone, yes. - Somethings wrong with me. - Wrong? I always want what I don't have. Fool. Bitch. You can be really charming. They were not at the station. Only my grandmother came, in black. I understood at once. Did you cry? Not at all. It's... It's absurd. I was scared that they'd dye all my clothes black. And then, I wanted to see the car wreck. Typically for a boy. Have you never missed your parents'? When I saw them 5 minutes daily, yes. But since they are gone... You ask too many questions. Why am I here'? Why me'? I owed you one, no'? You're here to ease your conscience. You're so respectable. Absolutely. I don't believe you. That's nice, but you're wrong. I have chosen, Marc. Against whom'? Against your parents'? No. Against my husband. Were you married, you'? Really? How old were you'? The final year. I'd have taken anyone to escape from home. - Your husband was just anybody? - Worse. He used me for his business. One day I had enough being manipulated. He had sold me. So I decided to sell myself. Now I can choose my friends. I have money. And everything is fine. - You'd prefer I lie to you'? - I don't know. May be. I feel so square. I feel you're several steps ahead. Don't change, please. At what time reverts the coach into the pumpkin? At 6 pm. I'll go to London. Come with me to Aix. No. For a weekend if you want. No. That's not enough. That asshole, only 3 years. He should be happy! - He's your client. - I'd rather be prosecutor. What's the matter? You've never been so bad. Fuck you! Fuck everybody! This country makes me sick! Are you sure'? Won't think a little'? No. I want to leave as soon as possible. Is it your separation that...? I really like you, Marc. And I'm interested in my employee's problems. - You're expected in the town hall. - Yes, yes. I'm coming. Anyway, you've no chance to leave before January. I need you. What's going on'? Antoine's brother has offered us his house. - You got mail. - Jeanne? Yes? - And the store'? - Dominique will replace me. You can stay here if you want. - How long will you stay? - Until the end of the month. It's the taxi. Hi, Marc. Yes? At your age, you old fart, you better leave girls alone. Was it for me'? Yes. Yes? - How are you'? - Can't you see'? What's up? About your girl, Samantha. Yes? Mario says she has a Chinese friend. And your wife'? She's away for 8 days. So if you could ask her, it would help me a lot. Since I was in Indochina I have a soft spot for... This Eurasian from the bowling? She talks Carcassonne accent. So if you could I arrange a meeting, it would be nice. Listen, George, Samantha and I... it's something different... So she's not a whore'? Yes, she is a whore. "This is Marc." I'm so glad you called. Why did you wait that long? "Well, after Brittany... It was simply hard for me..." I'm calling because I was wondering if... if you've time in the weekend'? - Next weekend'? - "Yes." Yes, of course. "You don't work?" - No. I will manage. - "Good." That's fine. But listen, I've got a small problem. I have... a friend, And... It appears you have a Chinese friend. "So we thought..." "We thought it could be nice if you could come together?" "Huh?" She's Vietnamese. She's Vietnamese, not Chinese. That's even better. Well, that's even better. Okay. Call me back tomorrow. You know the price. I'll call you. Big hug. It works out. It's funny, I'm nervous. I hadn't dared to ask for a Vietnamese. She's very yellow. You want to swap? Actually George wanted to come, but he's too busy. His daughter's ill. Had a nice trip'? I prefer to fly but Tang don't. We've booked at the Metropole. It's nice to start with lunch. It's a pretty name, Tang. Chin-chin, Tang. You... you have family at home'? Six brothers and two sisters, in Hanoi. And at Hanoi, you... What did you do there'? I've studied economics. It must be a change you. I mean France... A totally different world. It's funny, the different world, because... George, the friend who couldn't come, is an Indochina veteran. He got never really used life here again. Everything Vietnamese is for him... Especially the women. Vietnamese women are just... Right, Marc'? Sure. For me, it is rather... Shall we swap, maybe? Why not'? I have a lot gaps in economics. Huh? The check is before or after'? Listen... She stays with me. Of course... Like you want. You haven't understood anything. My little girl. It's so simple, you know. If he's a bastard just forget him, if he's a good guy he'll come to you. Say, are you at Francois' tomorrow? - At Francois?? - For Martine's birthday. - Oh no. I can't. - It's going to be fun. Josyane... - No! I said no. It's so boring. - I hate women. - That's new. Come on. You met her... Prettier than the Vietnamese? Oh no, no. You can't compare them. But she's a whore. Has she turned your head also? Yes. Really, it's true. She must be amazing. You're okay? - I passed by. I thought... - You thought well. Come in. - Want a drink? - Yes. This one! We missed you because we went home at 7am in a state... I tell you. How are things? Okay, thank you. Delighted. Shall we by the TV or in the dining room'? You stay? He's leaving. You're busy, right'? Well, then... Goodbye, Henry. Come on now. Bye. - He would have stayed the whole evening. - Oh no. I tried to call. ls there an error'? We'? Our TV is broken. We must watch the final. We almost missed the final. - What's wrong with the phone? - I unplugged it. Good. Mamie... She is charming. Your home is so cost. - Sit down. - Don't push me. Come on, Marc. She won't fly away. You're back in 10 minutes. - My jacket! - The jacket! - Look at that! - What... - I'll take a shower. - Yes, yes. - Is Marc there'? - No. But he'll come very soon. No. It was his first... - Who is that? - That's... Surprise. - How did it go'? - Fine. I said to her, "You're Jeanne." She said, "You're Samantha." We talked a little. She's nice, your wife. You could actually take your breakfast with us. Come on, Delmas. Your wifes are already at work. She's very nice, you know. Very nice. I've never been too fat. And you'? No. It's not my nature. We'll become skinny old ladies. My husband used to say that. You were married? Six months, with a writer. - It didn't work out'? - No. He was in love with himself. He looked in the mirror all the time. You know the type'? Have you had other men apart from Marc'? - That many? - Men who counted'? - Then there were three. - And you'? Four, with Marc. - Shall we have a souffle? - With Marc who's never on time He's comes home every day at 18 am. Have a taste? - 100g grated please. - Just a moment. 5F, please. Thank you. And before he was never on time? You know where I spent my wedding night? At the casino, with Marc and his buddies. Have you met them'? He sees them almost never, fortunately. Hats off. You still love him'? I always loved him somehow. Marc is like my family. But for the rest, there's Antoine. It's all over with Marc and me. Don't worry. Are you alright? Yes. It gets better. Wanna know why'? Yes. I always thought if Marc just snapped his fingers, he'd win you back at once. But now... It helps you to see him with her'? No. It helps me to see how you are with her. But how could that happen? Hello girls! Well, Claire, how's it going? The boss wants to see you. - The Jacquet case? - I don't think so. Ah, it is you, my little Marc. Come in. Have a seat. I really like you, and I wasn't very appealed by your African adventure. Until yesterday. They sent us a draft contract for you. I don't feel I've the right to detain from it you. Well, actually, I wanted to talk to you. I don't want to leave any more. Read the contract first. It's useless. My decision is made. Get the Jacquet file. - Antoine is visiting Fernand. Could you help me'? - Yes, of course. There was a guy calling. A certain Karl. You know him'? What did he want'? He wants to see you. He said it's important. He's at the Hotel DE France. Who is it'? An ex. Difficult? You're worried'? You're very kind. It's nothing. We could stay in Toledo, and a few days in Marbella. I can't, Karl. Samantha... something happened to me, since your vacation. I've gone mad. It's a kind of obsession, of attachment. We met regularly. Why did you let me down'? It wasn't easy to find you. But Karl, our relation was more professional. Yes. It's true. I realized that... Well, listen... The UNESCO sends me to New York for one year. My wife stays in Munich. - Don't you like New York? - Yes. No. No. Will you stay here'? I don't know. Is it so important? Yes. I must say something very naive; I actually thought I'm more than just a client. Karl, you are, I really love you, otherwise I wouldn't be here. She has started again, it will get around. - It was inevitable, I told you. - Too bad for Marc. - Maybe he knows it. - No, never. He's too much in love with her. Shouldn't we tell him...? What? What? No, seriously. We owe it to him, no'? No! You really want to say: "My dear Marc, we love you and we don't want you to die as a fool"? Wasn't it amazing? Did you see how they finished off Beziers? What's up? You know something? Nothing happened, Marc. Nothing happened, Marc! If someone had told you a similar thing about Jeanne, you'd believe it'? Certainly not. What did he want if not to screw you'? But he wanted to screw me. So what? Had he forgotten his wallet? Your friends are right, Marc. You're made like them. You're so little. You're not up to it. Well. A girl like you, must be respected'? Stop asking questions! Business is business, a whore's always a whore! Go play with your fucking friends! Cheat your wife with those shit buddies! This is your world. I've nothing to do here. We forgot who I was. Good we sorted that out. That's it. Fuck off. They're waiting already! - Kids... - What kid'? She fucks anyone! - Whore! - Don't say that! Why did he said that? It's the truth, Antoine. It's my work. I see. Was that really necessary? Hug Jeanne from me, huh'? Tell her that... For the first time in my life I felt I have family. Rwanda and what? Urundi! It's close to Zaire. I made it with the TV cook this morning. And Samantha? It's over. She was so nice! She's still nice, but with everyone. She's a whore. Oh no. Marc, don't use such a word. Such a brave girl! She takes 2000F per hour and 5000F for a whole day. To do what? Love, Therese. With whom'? With everyone. Me, others. A phone call and it happens. She's a call girl'? Exactly. That's why you go so far away? She was so nice. They are right in the soaps. Did you notice'? They're always the nicest girls. It's much better this way. Twelve armchairs in black leather. The ones you liked so much. For the federation offices. I had to wait 8 months for them. Then I opened the container: Pale pink! Leather chairs in pale pink. I called Milan. Rosetti had confused the orders. They were meant for a maternity home in Florida. "You've come to Samantha Lepage. Please leave a message..." I would call... I hope it's not serious? Okay. When will you come home'? Fine. See you tomorrow, darling. Shall we go to the cinema all three'? And afterward to Lucien'? Antoine stays with his wife. Their daughter has been operated. Nothing's changed here. He isn't resentful. Do you remember when he failed to throw you out'? No. How was her name, the daughter? I don't know. Maryse. I was afraid. Emergency operations are like that. She looks good now. Need a lift? Have you talked to your son'? I see you don't know. He wanted to tell you himself. Little Valerie is pregnant. No. Really? You'll be grandfather, Garnier. You can't avoid it. You can sleep at home. I've got a room at the Sofitel. You're okay? - Very good. - But after 30, no more sweets. I've still 5 minutes. Happy birthday, darling. You haven't forgotten. Marc! It's 9am! I told you it would leave holes. - Yes? - You see that? The image of a couple, but only the image. That's enough for me. A prove of your wisdom. - Almost no more porn, huh'? - Only erotic. The neighbour stole my customers, so I'm going cultural now. That works. You should have a computer. Everything's here. Not everything, fortunately. Shall we go to the cinema. Oh yes? Well, okay. You know that girl? Which girl? There are two American girls on vacation at the pharmacist. Pretty? A black one with such a... like that, and a redhead. With freckles everywhere'? I don't like redheads. I don't like blacks. No. Currently, Jeanne and I are trying... We UV- No. I can't do that to her. Already in bed'? Seen the time? Yes, but I had to stay in the office. We had some work. I called you. We went for dinner with Jacques and Francis. We talked a lot. Our dinner at the Rappeneau? Ah, shit. Shit, I totally forgot that. I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry. Me too. "Hello? Is that at M. Delmas? Yes. - "Isn't he at home'?" - No. Can I take a message? "Tell him I'm busy. I can't come today." - "This is Suzy speaking." - He'll be sorry. Okay? Jeanne left. Left... left? "Bye. Jeanne." Ah, yes. That is... It's obvious what it means, huh'? So you started again? Actually not, but... You know, she's so impulsive... Well, she's self confident. Yes. That's it. But eh... Don't you know where she is'? I haven't looked for her. The more I think, the more I find that Jeanne and you... NO, I beg you! - And the video club'? - Closed... Closed. Damn! And Samantha? Nothing. When I call her, she hangs up. You see... there was a time, when we lived all four of us, I enjoyed it. Well... It was a little weird, but... What will you do now'? I'll leave for Africa on Saturday. Would you take care of Jeanne? You scared me. Excuse me. I'm glad to see you. How are you'? Come on in. I'll be right there. A Scotch? Well'? What's going on'? Yeah, you know... Not too much. And you? - You work a lot'? - No. I take a sabbatical year. You see, I'm an old egoist, Samantha. When you came, everything worked well. Well okay. You said, the four of us, it seemed a little weird. And then you left and everything became a mess. It would be so nice if you came back. If we all came back. Is that all? You know... it doesn't happen much at home. Jeanne has left, you too... Marc goes to Africa, and I'm all alone like an idiot. What says Marc about it'? You know, Marc, he's is like you, play acting. He says nothing but he suffers. Well... I think you can come in now. "Departure for Entebbe UTA flight No 817. Boarding at Gate 41." Goodbye, my dear. Call us. - Stay in touch. - Will do. "Arrival from Paris-Orly... Air Inter flight 4527, at zone C." Thank you.
