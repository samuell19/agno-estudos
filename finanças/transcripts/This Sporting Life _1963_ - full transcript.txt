(SPECTATORS) Come on England, come on... (SPECTATORS, CHEERING AND SHOUTING) (WHISTLE BLOWN) (RATTLES) Come on, lads get some weight into it! Come on get stuck in. (SPECTATORS CHEERING) (SOUND OF A DRILL) Come on. Come on over here. Bloody hell! He's broke his front teeth. (GASPING) You won't want to see no tarts for a week. How is he? He's just a bit dazed. He'll be alright though. It's not to bad. How do you feel? You ought to charge more rent. I don't mind telling you Mrs Hammond. But when I first came here I thought I'd fallen easy. I don't want a list of my shortcomings. I'm only trying to show you where you're hurting yourself most. Can't I talk to you just for once as a person. If you listen to what I have to say. I could really put you right. I wish you wouldn't try and work me into a fit. I've asked you before to leave me alone, that way. I can't stand it. How do you feel, Frank? You won't be able to shoot your mouth off like you used to... (LAUGHING) ...at least not for a few days. Can you fix me up with a dentist? I don’t know. It's Christmas you know, Frank. I want it tonight. Well, I... I can try. Tonight! Come on, you lot, let's have you out! (LAUGHTER) How do I look? I've seen worse. Go on, you're dry. You going to Weaver's party tonight, Frank? I've been counting on it. I'd leave well alone if I were you. Weaver and parties. I'd get your mouth seen to first it's more important. How's your Mrs Hammond? She's alright. I bought some presents for her kids. Bet she won't like it though. She doesn't like me interfering. Hallo Frank. - How are you lad? - Not now Johnson we're in a hurry. - Oh Mr Weaver. - Yes George. - Frank's ready whenever you want him. - Oh good. How's it going Frank? (MUMBLES) I'm alright. Hello Maurice. What are you coming in the car too. Oh I wouldn't miss seeing Frank in the chair. I might even get a camera. (LAUGHING) You can put your little doggie in the boot, George. Right-Oh, Mr Weaver. What about your little dog, Frank? Go on in, Dad. That's not very funny. Let's have a look at you then. It's not me, old lad it's Frank here. Right. Come on. I've a Member's Ticket, that'll be how you traced me. I haven't seen a match this season. Sit yourself down. (CHURCH BELL SOUNDS) Ah, it's a mess. They'll have to come out. Six of them. It's all I can do. Well, hasn't Weaver arranged to pay you? Oh, that's not the point, I'm afraid. He'll need a plate. What of it? I can't go making plates for him. This is a Children's Department. Well, kids have false teeth. I know a couple who have. - Do you? - (MAURICE) All right, you do the pulling, get your mate to do the plate. We'll pay, never mind Weaver. It's no party here, let's get on with it. Aye, you see, he's in pain. It'll be ten guineas. - Ten guineas? - Take it or leave it. Come on, whatever the bloody price. (DENTIST) It'll have to be gas. Have you eaten recently? No, not since my dinner. Well, would you mind waiting outside? (FRANK) Go on, Maurice. Right. Could you put your hands in your pockets?... That's it. Sit tight. You'll feel nothing. Breathe deeply. Sit tight. Keep your hands in your pockets. You'll feel nothing. (HEAVY BREATHING) (FRANKS VOICE) I've been thinking... (FRANKS VOICE) ...why don't we go for a walk? What on earth for? What do you want us to go walking about in the bloody pitch dark for? Well, I like to talk to someone when I'm walking. You know, your problems; they're sort of... You've plenty of friends. Here, look at this funny man. Here, you play with it. You must be mad to think I'd go out there, walking with you. (MRS HAMMOND) I don't want you poking your nose into my affairs. You won't find me poking my nose into yours. I have some pride left, if you didn't know. Don't you want to be happy? If I'm left alone, I am happy. I don't need you pushing in. I'm not pushing in! I'm just trying to be friendly. Well, I'm not going about all day with a grin over my face - just to make you think I'm happy. - I don't mean laughing all the time. I mean, you just don't look happy. It's not a... not a question of laughing all the time... You make me sick! All right, I am sick. I'm bloody sick of living here, an' all! (MRS HAMMOND) Mr Machin, that's easily settled... don't. Just stop living here. We'll be better off without you. (INHALES, EXHALES) (SOUND OF RAPPING ON DOOR) Come on, open up! - What have you got in there. - Come on! Come on, open up, you boss-eyed git! (COACH HORN BEEPS) (CHEERING) Oi, you and me. Catch it, Dad. Come on, open up! The Manager's expecting us. Come on, Jeff. Come on, open up! Jeff, come on. Excuse me. I'm with players. I'm with players! I'm sorry, Mr Johnson, didn't know it was you. Come on in. (APPLAUSE) (MC) And now, ladies and gentlemen, comes the big moment of the evening. (MC) The winners in tonight's fifty-pounds Freestyle Dance Contest: (MC) Miss Evie Turner and Mr John Whittaker. (DANCERS CHEER AND WHISTLE) As you may have noticed, ladies and gentlemen, we've just been joined by a party from another winning team of whom we're all very proud... our City Rugby League Team! (WILD CHEERING, WHISTLLNG) Come on, the City! (MC) And now, I'm going to ask a couple of these famous men to kindly step up here and present the winners with their prizes. (MC) Len Miller and Maurice Braithwaite! (MC) Come on, Len, come on, Maurice. Just wait 'till I've finished this half. Come on, Len! (CHEERING, WHISTLLNG) (MC) Ladies and Gentlemen: Len Miller, Captain of the City, and Maurice Braithwaite. (MC) How do. (THE CROWD CHEERS) (MC) Well, thank you, Len, thank you, Maurice. (MC) And now, ladies and gentlemen... (MC) ...it's on with the dance. It's a general Excuse Me, and may the best man win! (MUSIC BEGINS) Excuse me. Got this one. He just called a general Excuse Me. Do you want a thumping, love? Aye. Well, you'd better come outside and Excuse Me there. Hold on a minute. Hold on! You... Now, what's it all about, then? I was meaning to ask you. Well, what's that? Your name is Johnson, isn't it? Aye, that's right. You're a scout for the City. You could say so. Can you get me a trial? Aah! Now, wait! Wait a minute, lad. (RATTLES, MURMUR OF CROWD) (FRANK) Why don't you come and see me play? (FRANK) I need someone to cheer me. (MRS HAMMOND) You can cheer yourself. You won't catch me up there freezing to death for an hour. It's my first game; a lot depends on it. - You don't have to do it. - It's a job. If I play well and they sign me, I might get three or four hundred quid. I'm sure they'll give you all that. Well, that's just the sort of encouragement I need. (FRANK) Come and see, I'd like you to come. If I wanted to go I would; I've said it. I don't want to. Wish us luck, then. (MRS HAMMOND) All that's coming your way. I don't wish you my luck. I'll have to make do with my own, then, won't I? (REFEREE'S WHISTLE) (THE CROWD ROARS) That's it, Frank! Well done, lad! What's his name, Wade? Er... Machin. Er, Frank Machin. Oh, Charles is here. Hallo, Charles. - Charles. - Gerald. (FRANK) Pass the ball, Gower. (PLAYER) Pass the bloody ball, you nit! (FRANK) Pass the ball, you git! Come on, Gower, get after it! Let's have that bloody ball in future, you nut! Get stuffed. (REFEREE'S WHISTLE) Come on, Gower, get rid of that bloody ball! - Come on, Gower! - Pass the ball, man! (REFEREE'S WHISTLE) Bloody hell! Hey, Gower, what're you playing at, you bloody frog? (LOUD THUMP) (REFEREE'S WHISTLE) Trainer, trainer! Come here. What's your name? How do you mean, Ref? I didn't do it. - I never touched him. - You can tell that to Rugby League Chairman. Look, I swear to God, I never touched him. Look at my bloody fists, there's no blood on them! - Go on, get off! Off! - Takes some beating... bloody hell! He's not fit to be on a football field. Aye. (SPECTATORS BOO) (SPECTATOR) Don't come back here again! (REFEREE'S WHISTLE ) They got the wrong man there. You think so, Mr Slomer? Of course. It's as plain as the nose on your face. That's not what I call football. It's a rough game, Charles. Personally, I like to see a man playing as if he really meant it. (CROWD CHEERS) (REFEREE'S WHISTLE) You played a blinder, Frank! You played a blinder. You enjoyed it? Ah, come on, lad, they'll be all over you. I was sitting right int' middle of Committee. Don't get excited, Dad. Come on, I'll buy you a drink. (FRANK) What are you having? I'll have a beer. Two beers, please. You won't find them no different from me, lad. Maybe they won't show it. Naturally, they... they shot it like me. Allow me. - What? - No, allow me. I really do insist. A double, Bob. Well, you played a good game today, Frank. Aye, he played a blinder. I wouldn't worry about him, he's a bit soft. (LAUGHS) How'd you like the City? I'm getting the hang of it. Yes, I rather gathered that. Pity about Taffy Gower. What about him? (WEAVER) They've taken him to hospital. I believe it was a broken nose. You know, for a little fellow their hooker packs quite a punch. It's bad luck. Yes, it is. You haven't signed on here? No, they haven't made their minds up yet. Well, I don't think they'll find that too difficult... (WEAVER) ...do you? Goodbye, Frank. Who was it? You know, Frank. Who was it, Dad? Guess... Go on, have a guess. Who was it? That's mean, Frank. That's mean. Who was it, Dad? That's mean. Why did you squeeze my wrist like that? I don't know. Why? Was it Weaver? You hurt me, you know. Just because it was Weaver. You get far too excited, lad. I thought you knew it was Weaver. I was surprised, him talking to me like that. He must have been impressed. Do you think there's something? Aye. Do you want me to come home with you? It's no trouble... no trouble to me. Aye. Aye. Come if you like. Have some tea. Mrs Hammond won't mind. (JOHNSON) Bit of a coincidence, me knowing her husband. Yep. Not that well, mind; maybe only a year afore he died. I say, them's not his boots, are they? What's she keep 'em for? I don't know. (JOHNSON) How long have you lived here, Frank? Oh, about five or six months. She had some kids, didn't she? - Aye. - How does she manage? She does all right... she does all right. She just... put up the shutters and stopped living. My wife left me ten year ago. Hmm... Isn't it warm, Mum? Warm...? You know we can't use all that coal, Mr Machin. Don't worry, I'll fetch you a load home from t' pit. Mr Johnson, this is Mrs Hammond... Ian, and Lynda. We haven't much in for tea. Don't boast about it. Mr Johnson might get the idea we're poor. You sit down. All right, there, young love? Ooh, you're getting very heavy! I know! Tell me... what have you been doing? Been out shopping with me mam. Have you now. And where else did you go? We went to see our dad. How did the match go? Did you win? He played a blinder, Missus, he played a blinder. Oh. Did he? And have they signed him on? Nay, it's not as quick as that. But after today's match he'll be able to ask anything he likes. Isn't that right, Frank? Frank, isn't that right? I don't know! Aye, it won't pay them to turn you down, you know, lad. I'm sure they'll give him it, Mr Johnson. Aye, he'll sail away. He'll sail away. You'll be very pleased. I'll see you then, Dad. You don't mind me helping you, do you, Frank? Why do you say that? Well, you know... I, I mean... if I'm in a position to help, I think it's only right. Aye... I think it's right. (FRANK) You don't mind? No. (LAUGHS) Don't know what you're talking about! Oh... well, that's all right, then. I'll see you. You know, any... any time at all. Aye, see you, Dad. (POTS RATTLING) (MRS HAMMOND) You play for nothing, then? I get amateur pay... thirty bob. (MRS HAMMOND) That's hardly a wage. Well, they pay you good money when they sign you on. The old man treats you like a son. I... wouldn't say that. I call him 'Dad' because he's old. I don't mean that. - What do you mean? - The way he treats you. The way he ogles you. He looks at you like a girl. Now, don't come with that. He's interested, that's all. I'd say excited. Well, excited, then! What are you getting on about? He hasn't got much to get excited about at his age. He's done a lot for me. He's never had a job of work in his life. How do you know he's never worked? Because I've got eyes. You just look at his hands. He's got awful hands, they're all soft. What have hands got to do with it? He's got awful hands... I've got awful hands. We're not all women. Well, it's nothing to do with me. Your husband... I gather he worked at Weavers Engineering? Who told you that? Johnson. Said he used to know him. He must have told you something else. No. I expect he thought it was very... chivalrous of you, helping a widow, and all that... You reckon it's nothing... to you what people think. It isn't. It's bringing Eric's name into it I don't like. You see, when Eric died... well, all my world went out. He used say he didn't know why he was living. He used to say: 'How was I ever made alive?' When he went like that, I felt I hadn't been proper to him. I hadn't made him feel as if he belonged. I shouldn't be telling you this, should I? I... I don't mind. (MRS HAMMOND) No... I mean, you being what you are. Self-reliant; all that cockiness. You don't seem worried like Eric was. I... I only mentioned it because... well, because I saw you polishing them boots. Is there anything the matter with me cleaning them? No... No... like I said... I don't mind. (FRANK'S VOICE) A thousand pounds. (WADE'S VOICE) A thousand? (WADE'S VOICE) That's a very large sum for a player just entering the game. (FRANK'S VOICE) I want one thousand down. Now, look here, Frank... we're not providing a comprehensive insurance policy. That's a very fair offer Mr Riley's made. I want a thousand pounds... down. Now, look, we're not trying to put anything over on to you. I wish you'd get that into your head. But we are representing other people, we're responsible for investing their money soundly. I can't change my mind. I feel I'm worth it. What does Mr Slomer think? My only surprise is that you're discussing such a figure at all. What figure would you suggest? I'm far from convinced that he's the kind of player we want, in the first place. You realise, as I'm sure Frank does... that we're not the only club that's interested? We're not here to worry about other clubs. We're here to decide whether we want him. (SLOMER) Well, you've had my opinion. Frank, could you wait outside a minute? How goes it, Frank? Have they fixed you up? They're talking about it now. Let me get you a drink. Whiskey? Whiskey, Bob. I'm Phillips, from the City Guardian. You needn't take it seriously. Why not? It's only a game, old sport. It's all a game... for Weaver's benefit. You mean, they act like that just for Weaver? Well, it's his cash they're dishing out. His or Slomer's. If Slomer hates your guts, Weaver 'll buy you out of spite. I see you've got a bruise coming. No, Weaver wouldn't have you up here just to say ta-ta, you know. (WADE) Frank. What do you aim to do, Frank, if we don't sign you? Don't know. Carry on as I am. Can't you change your mind about splitting the payment? No. No, one thousand down. Well, I'm afraid there's nothing else for it, then. You're not going to sign me? That's it. We'll have to. Congratulations, Frank. (LAUGHING) (MILLER) Congratulations, Frank. (WADE) Hold it. (WADE) That's it. Well, aren't you going to read it? (LAUGHING) Aye. Well, don't spend it all at once now, will you, lad? (LAUGHING) (WEAVER) Well, Frank, what does it feel like, lad? I don't feel much. (WEAVER) It's all a bit quick; I'm afraid that's my fault. I like to get these things settled. I suppose you don't mind. Not now, I don't. Did you have any other offers? No... at least, I didn't hear anything. Well, if you do, you'll know what to say... property of the city. (LAUGHS) Best to make sure, Frank. Fairfax Street... now, that rings a bell. Aye. A fellow called Hammond used to live there. He got killed at your place... Weaver's. I've digs with his widow. Hammond. Hmm... Yes, Eric Hammond, wasn't it? Yeah. Well, I remember the funeral. How'd he get killed? Quite nasty. He was working with a lathe. Very careless. He was using a hand-file. It shot off and stuck half-way through him. We had half an idea he'd done it on purpose. On purpose... Yes. Funny way to commit suicide. She didn't get any compensation. The case went against her. We gave her a bit... not much. End of the street, or the front door? Ah, end of the street will do. Right. - Good night, Frank. - Good night, Mr Weaver. Frank! Hey, Frank! Hi, Dad. What are you doing down here, then? Did you sign? Have they signed you on? They wouldn't have me, Dad. They wouldn't have me. You ought to have seen 'em. They're round that Weaver like a... a pack of dogs around a bitch. I told them what to do with their stinking, filthy bastard money. You haven't done that? Aye. You're not crying about it, are you? You're not crying? So it was all for nothing, eh? Nay... Hey, Dad. I was only kidding you about it! I was only kidding. How much do you think it is? You tell me, Frank. You tell me. A thousand quid. Nay! Aye. - D'you want to see the cheque? - Aye, could I see it? You and me, Frank... that's us. How much of it do you want, Dad? Oh, no, Frank. What do you mean, 'oh, no, Frank'? - Oh, no, Frank, I... - Now, Dad, listen. I don't en joy getting kicked about on a football field for other people's amusement. I only enjoy it if I've been paid a lot for it. Now I want you to share some of this. No, Frank, I don't want any of it. All right, then. I'll send you some of it. No, wait, Frank. I didn't do it for the money. That Johnson called earlier on. That friend of yours. I've just seen him. You mean he's been waiting all this time? It was hours ago. He likes to get out and about a bit. You should have friends your own age. I have. They've signed me on. Didn't you hear what I said? Yes. You'll be pleased. (FRANK) So will you when you guess how much it is. Oh, I don't know anything about it. Go on, have a guess. Just guess how much you think I'm worth. Three pence? Now, careful, careful... you made a joke. You can't go round cracking jokes like that, you know... you might do yourself an injury. Well, come on, have a guess. Come on. No... Well, I'd better tell you since you're so keen. One thousand pounds. Oh... you're a great ape. You don't believe me? Look, I've got the cheque here in my pocket. One thousand pounds in letters and in numbers. Signed, sealed and delivered, Frank Machin. They drove me home in their car... a bloody Bentley! It's very good. You don't sound very excited about it. It's a bit more than I got when my husband died. Well, isn't that right bloody handsome of you! You didn't have to do anything for it. You mean I didn't have to get killed for it! Some people have life made for them. That's right, Mrs Hammond, and some people make it for themselves. It's about time you took that ton of rock off your shoulders. And don't wake me in the morning, I might be dead! (MRS HAMMOND'S VOICE) That money... (MRS HAMMOND'S VOICE) ...does it mean you'll be leaving now? No. I don't think so. ...keeping herself... You're done. ...so small small... You'd better get him off home. He'll be all right when he gets in the fresh air. Get him into bed. (FRANK MUMBLING) Doesn't understand... Keeping herself small... (FRANK) Ooh! Here, come on, what's the matter, Frank? She's so... she's so small. Oh, he's all right... he's just full of gas, that's all. Get hold of him... (FRANK) She's so bloody small... (WEAVER) Are you going to get in, Frank? She gives me nothing. She gives me bloody nothing! (THE CAR STARTS UP) (MAURICE SINGING) 'If I were the marrying kind, ' (MAURICE SINGING) 'which thank the Lord I'm not, sir, ' (MAURICE SINGING) 'The kind of man that I would wed would be a rugby fullback.' (MAURICE SINGING) 'He'd find touch, ' 'I'd find touch, ' - 'We'd both find touch together...' - Frank. (MAURICE SINGING) 'We'd be all right in the middle of the night, find... ' Oh, the patient's awake! We've heard all your subconscious what-nots. Haven't we, Mr Weaver? My carrier... What's he want? My carrier. (FRANK SHOUTING) My carrier! Steady, lad, steady! Did he have a carrier? Is this it? What have you got in there, then? Presents. - What did you say? - Presents! (VOICES OF CHILDREN PLAYING) Come on. What do you think of it? - Have you bought it? - Aye. It's a bit of all right, isn't it? You're not going to leave that thing there, are you? Why not? You won't smile when you come for a drive in it. 'Ere, he can take you out on Sunday afternoons now, Mrs Hammond! Don't worry, you'll never get me to go in that thing. It's like riding around in your own front room! Come on, Ian, let's come for a drive. Don't mind your mother... come on. Watch your head. Hey, I want him for his dinner! Look, he's got to get back to school! Don't worry, I'll take him in this. We won't be long. (CHEERING, SHOUTING) Frank, lad, we're there. (GIRL) It's Frank! Frank Machin! (GIRL) Come on, Frank. (CROWD) Hurray! Come on, show 'em your smile, Frank. Come on, smile for them, Frankie! Ha, ha! You shouldn't be here, lad. Can I take you home? I'm all right, Dad. (REVELLERS SINGING) '...He'd push hard, ' 'and I'd push hard, ' 'We'd both push hard together.' 'And there we'd be in the middle of the night, ' 'pushing hard together.' 'If I were the marrying kind...' (TRUMPETS BLARE) (WOMAN SCREAMS) (MILLER) You've come, have you, Frank? (GIRL) How are you, then? All right, darling? - D'you know where the bathroom is? - Aye, it's up them stairs, there. (CROWD SINGING) 'He'd run hard, ' 'and I'd run hard, ' 'We'd both run hard together...' (HAMMERING ON DOOR) Come on, Frank. It's me, Maurice. I know you're in there, you daft frog! What's the matter? Sulking? (JOHNSON) Hey, Frank, come on out, will you! (MRS HAMMOND'S VOICE) How far are we going? (FRANK) I thought we'd make a day of it. (FRANK) Go for a run in the country. (FRANK) You don't mind, do you? We can't very well get out now, can we? We can stop the car and turn back, if you're so keen. Look, if it's only for the children's sake, it's worth it... don't you reckon? (FRANK) Come on, Ian. That's a good boy. There's a good lad. Come on, then. Come to the next one. Come on, Ian, you throw, then. Let's go and play soccer, Lynda. (THE CHILDREN LAUGH) (LYNDA) Now give it to me! (FRANK) Here, gotcha! (FRANK) I've got you! (FRANK) Drop it! Drop it! Drop it! (FRANK) Round and round and round.... Come on, Ian, kick us a goal, then. (LAUGHS) Come on Ian, kick us a goal. Come on, then. Margaret, catch it! Oh, I'm no good at catching. Come on, Lynda. Come on, then. Catch it. Frank! Catch it! See, it's easy. Come on, throw us a catch. Ooh! Now look who can't catch! Come on, Ian. Come on, Ian. Come on, Ian. I'll tell you. Catch this. Ready? Catch this one. Wa-ay up in the sky. THE CHILDREN LAUGH We've lost the ball! (LYNDA) Frank, take me with you! (MRS HAMMOND) Lynda! Lynda. Lynda, stop waving, you'll have Mr Machin fall into the water. (LYNDA) Oh, give over! (SHE LAUGHS) Look, be careful! Lynda! Look, be careful, love. Mam did you see us. Whatever did you want to go and do that for? I just wanted to cool off a bit. One, two, three... - Mam, mam, did you see us? - Yes, I did. Come on, Ian. I'll change my shoes. (THE CROWD ROARS) Go on, get it! Ah, he's got done it! Machin! (CHEERING, RATTLES) (FRANK) Come here! Hey, make a good job of it. Aye, Mr Wade. Come on, you two fairies, let's have you out of here. Why don't you come in, Ken, and let's have a look and see what you've got! I'll come in and show you what I've got, all right. Come on, I mean it, let's have you out. (FRANK) Hey, have you got any more beer? Len, come on, let's have this hosepipe on them. Let's have some cold water on you! Watch it, it's freezing, you daft frog, it's freezing! Right on that body there! It's lovely. Oh, that's lovely! It's beautiful. (WADE) It was a good game, you know. Oh, he's got the makings... (MRS WEAVER) Isn't that Frank Machin over there? Yes, it is, love. Fond of kids, isn't he? Hmm... it's not quite how I pictured him. Right down the wing, you throw an over head pass like that... - Ready, Frank? - Aye, one moment. Have you seen Cleopatra? Well, she looks all right, doesn't she? Would you like to meet him? Yes, ask him over. Frank. (WEAVER) Come over here a moment. Ah, the Emperor calls. Here, go steady, you bloody nut. Well done, Frank. Well done, lad. And how are you feeling? - Champion. - Good I'd like you to meet my wife, Frank. How do you do. Frank Machin. You're one of the stalwarts of the City, according to my husband. That's a relief. (LAUGHTER) (MRS WEAVER) Well, he doesn't seem to be a very sociable giant. (WEAVER) He's probably shy. (MRS WEAVER) I've asked my husband to introduce us before, but he's such a slowcoach. I like meeting his protégés every now and then. I think he sometimes keeps them too much to himself. (MRS WEAVER) All his stars. We don't have stars in this game, Mrs Weaver. That's soccer. Well, what do you have, then? People like me. (THEY LAUGH) I've got a thirst; I think I'll be off. Glad to have met you. Goodbye, Machin. - Goodbye, Frank. - Goodbye, Frank. You played a great game. Now, keep it up, lad. Ah, Machin. You did very well today, young man. Thank you, Mr Slomer. Yes, very good try. Yes, very good indeed. Keep it up. Thank you, Mr Slomer. (FRANK) Come on. Watch the door. Hallo, Frank. Hi, Dad. (KIM SINGING) 'Walking back to happiness, ' 'Oopah, woah, yeah, yeah...' 'Bid farewell to loneliness, 'Oopah, woah, yeah, yeah...' 'I never knew I'd miss you.' (FRANK) Hey, love... what d'you wear when it's hot? (MILLER) Where's your husband gone, fishing? Aye, he's left his bloody bait at home, an all! (KIM) 'Making up for things we said, ' '...Oopah, woah, yeah, yeah...' 'And mistakes to which they led...' Hey, love, show us your personality! Hey, Maurice, how's that tart of yours, then? - Who? Judith? - Aye. Does she come across with the old, er, one-two? Now, watch it, Frank. Just be careful whose bloody coat tail you're pulling. Oh, Maurice, you know I love you, don't you? I'm not your flag to wave up and down the street! You need stuffing, Maurice, you know that, don't you? Women! Bloody women! (KIM) 'Walking back to happiness.' 'Walking back to happiness.' 'Walking back to happiness...' '...again.' Oh, here she comes. Hey, she's brought her mother with her. (JUDITH) Hallo. (MAURICE) Hallo, love. Er, this is the tart I was telling you about. Oh, God, just listen to the way he talks about me! I think I'll come back when you've done. (FRANK) Aye. You should have come in a few minutes ago. How do, Judith. Oh, he has told you my name, then? That and, er, other things. Ooh, watch it, Tarzan. Oh, yeah... this is Pam. Hallo. How do you do? - Hallo, Pam. - Hallo. I saw your try this afternoon. I got a good pass. Ooh, ain't he modest! - Would you like a drink? - Gin and orange. Gin and orange. - Judith? - Gin and tonic, please. Gin and tonic. Hey, Keith? A little service, Keith. Come on, a little service. (DRUMROLL) And now, ladies and gentlemen... are there any volunteers? Is there anyone at all that can dance, sing, hum, show their muscles, do a striptease, fan dance or bubble dance? Come on, Maurice! Go on, Maurice, do a dance! Ah, I see we have a few of our City heroes here tonight... including our old friend, Frank Machin. Come on, Frank, give a song. Come on, Frank. All right, Frank? Right. Right. Pick your mike up. (PIANIST BEGINS SONG) Right. (PIANIST BEGINS SONG) (FRANK SINGING) 'Here, in my heart, ' (FRANK SINGING) 'I'm alone and so lonely.' 'Here, in my heart, ' 'I just yearn for you only.' 'Here in my arms, I long to hold you, ' 'Hold you so near, ever close to my heart.' 'So, darling... '...say that you care, 'Take my love...' '...I give gladly.' 'Surely you know...' '...I need your love so badly.' 'Here in my heart.' 'My love and my all, dear.' 'Here in my arms... and stay here in my heart.' (CHEERING) (FRANK SINGS TO HIMSELF) (HE LAUGHS) (MILK BOTTLES CLATTER) (HE HAMMERS ON DOOR) (FRANK) Hey, come on, get the door open. There's not a bloody war on! I'm sorry I'm late. (MRS HAMMOND) It's all right. Hah, that's all right, then. You've been drinking. Aren't you going to ask me how we got on? Why, did you play football until this time, then? No. I've been out with the lads... you know... living. (MRS HAMMOND) You must have had a hard time. As a matter of fact, we did. You're drunk. You've come back here drunk. That's no bloody crime. You're not me mother... me something or other. What are you getting on about? Sssh! I tell you... I'd like it a lot... if you'd let me call you 'Sunshine', Margaret. (FRANK) 'Sunshine'. (HE BELCHES) 'Sunshine...' (VOICES OF CHILDREN PLAYING) (MRS HAMMOND) Ian! Don't go getting it all over your clothes! (MRS HAMMOND) Lynda? (LYNDA) Yes, Mum? (MRS HAMMOND) Where are you, love? (LYNDA) In the kitchen. (MRS HAMMOND) Oh, that's all right, then. I just wondered where you were. Oh, I... I didn't know you were in. I was just going to make up the bed. I'm off to work in half an hour. I didn't hear you come in. I never know where I am, what with the... children on holiday. No, Frank, no! It's all right. Oh, no! It's all right. Frank, no! No... Frank! (LYNDA) Mam! Go away, Lynda. Go away, Lyn. (LYNDA) What are you doing, Mam? Go on out to play, Lynda, love. (LYNDA) Mam! Go away, Lynda. Go away! Oh...! You're a man! You're a bleedin' man! (HE GROANS) (NOISE OF PARTY FADES IN) (VOICES OF CHILDREN PLAYING) Aren't you going to say anything? (GLASS SHATTERS) You made a right bloody muck-up of that loose forward! (BUISNESSMAN) Aye, he won't play again for six months! (BUSINESSMAN) Better watch out you don't get suspended! Ah, what else could I do... what else could I do? Look, this big character comes around the blind side every time there's a scrum. I just stand in his way, he's never looking. (BUSINESSMAN) 'Stand in his way!' I get me shoulder under his jaw... booph! He goes down like a child. (BUSINESSMAN) He did! I began to count the times he came around that scrum. (FRANK) Fourteen times. I must've hit every part of his face. (BUISNESSMAN) You should have seen him. Bradshaw, that's the name. Aye, and the fifteenth time he came round, they carried him off... flat out. He bloody were, an' all! You could hear the crack all over t' ground. Aye, it just proves I'm a good defensive player. (THEY ALL LAUGH) (BUSINESSMAN) Hello, Charles. Hello, Frank, how's it going? Champion, Mr Slomer. Champion. I hope you're not giving too many trade secrets away. Have you changed your mind about Frank, then, Charles? Oh, now, steady, John. When Weaver first signed him, I thought we were making a mistake. But I don't mind admitting it... this big lad gives me as much pleasure on that football field as anybody can today. Mind you, it's nothing like the old days, young man... nothing like. (VARIOUS) Oh, no, no, no...'course not. I hear you... Hi, Ed. I've noticed my photographs are getting a bit small lately. - See to it, will you? - Now, then, tiger. And put a bit of a smile on my face when I'm scoring. Hi, Maurice. What's up with you, then? Nothing, I'm just waiting for Judith. Cop us two, Jack. I try and take my pleasures quietly. Ah... when I see those frogs gathered around, I... just shoot 'em a line, that's all. Oh, yeah... I brought you your mail down from the ground. Half a dozen. One a week's about my record. Why don't you bring that... woman of yours down here some time... that Margaret? She wouldn't come. Bloody school-kids! Why wouldn't she come? She's a home bird. Are you taking the jam out of somebody's sandwich without paying for it, then? Me? No, she's a home bird. I've just told you. Now shut up. Watch out with that tiger, Maurice, he'll snap your hand off. Oh, I can take care of him, Ed. (LAUGHS) Watch it. Hey, Maurice. Maurice. Have a read of that. Come on. 'Dear Frank Machin, enjoyed watching you play'... rare times I watch the game. Forgive me if... Perhaps you could drop by for a drink sometime this week. Wednesday afternoon might be suitable. Best wishes, Ann Weaver.' Ann Weaver? You're not going, are you? Read the P.S. 'P.S. This doesn't mean bring any of your rowdy team mates.' Is that meant to be a joke or something? You're not taking it seriously, are you? Why not? I've got nothing to lose. I wouldn't be so sure about that. She just thinks I'm good-looking, that's all. - Ah, give us a kiss, will you? - Ah, don't come with that, Maurice. Careful, Tarzan! What're you doing to him? Come on, I want some husband left, you know! How d'you mean, 'husband'? Why, hasn't he told you? We just got engaged. - Hey, shut up! - Engaged? Ah, no wonder... no wonder he's been so rough! Eh, the Lord help you. Give us a kiss, love. Congratulations, Maurice. When are they going to start ringing them bells, then? - We're planning on Easter. - Oh-ho! Well, you'll be laughing again yourself when it happens to you, Tarzan. 'When it happens to me'? I'll put up a bigger fight than that. No, they're never satisfied, are they, Maurice? Women! They don't frighten me, Maurice... they don't frighten me. (MRS WEAVER) Happy Christmas. Happy Christmas. Oh, we're having a party on Christmas Eve. You'll be coming, of course? We've got a match Christmas Eve; it's a Saturday. But I could come on afterwards. Well, see you do, then. I suppose playing professional football, you don't need a full-time job? Not unless you're interested in the money. Are you, Frank? I like to put it to good uses. Like what, for example? Well, like helping people out, things like that. Is that why you bought such a big car? I must say, you've been very successful. Well, it's like this, Mrs. Weaver: you see something and you go out and you get it. It's as simple as that. You make it sound very simple. Do you like gardens? No. Oh, Frank. Have another drink. Help yourself. You're not playing football this afternoon, are you? No. I like you. You're like a big cat. You're always moving. I've never seen anyone so restless. Come and sit down. I'm not so sure I should be here. Oh, Frank, don't take that silly attitude. Come and sit down. Nothing's happened to upset you, has it? No, nothing. There's no need to feel awkward. I don't know... Don't talk. I think I ought to go. Oh, why? I thought you were behaving so nicely. I don't think it's fair. Oh, 'fair'! You're not feeling... you know... out of your depth? I might be. Well, there's no need, you can see it... It's not Mrs Hammond, is it? Mrs Hammond? The woman you live with. I lodge there. Whatever way you like to put it. Is it her? I've been thinking about Mr Weaver. Oh, I see. I think I'll go. You're going? (FRANK'S VOICE) Look, I think that... (MRS WEAVER'S VOICE) There's no need to explain, Frank... (FRANK'S VOICE) You don't seem to understand... (MRS WEAVER'S VOICE) Either come in, or go! (SOUND OF DOOR CLOSING) (NOISE OF PARTY FADES IN) Say it... say it, say it, say it, say it... Say it! Why don't you say it? (MRS HAMMOND'S VOICE) Say what? (FRANK) Say you've got some feeling for me. Frank, I can't. Not yet. But you know me, and how I've been to you. I can't let my feelings go. Not again. Not to have them cut off like Eric and... everything gone in one person, and... and dead. You've got to give me time, Frank. There may not be enough of us left to enjoy it by that time. Oh I don't know... You might just want to hear me say it. You... You... might feel that's all you wanted, and go away. But you keep fighting me. I can't be that bad. When are you going to give us some peace? I come upstairs with you, don't I? But you make me feel I'm buying it, I'm just buying, and I'm not! Well, that's me. That's how I am. I've nothing more to give you, Frank. - You don't mean that. - I wish you wouldn't work me up like this, telling me how I should feel. If only you'd leave me alone a bit.... You're so... big, Frank, you're so stupid. You don't give me a chance! (DOOR SLAMS SHUT) (DISTANT NOISE OF PARTY) Oh, my God... Maurice. Mauri... Well, Machin. What do you want? Hallo, Frank. Come in, we won't eat you. Well, Gerald, aren't you going to offer a drink to this wild young man? A whiskey will do. Mrs Weaver. They're making a lot of noise downstairs. Last time I open my house to this crowd. Every scruff in town seems to be here. You've been in the wars this week, young man. I'll be all right. I'll be all right. He'll have to learn he has to pay something for his ambition. I think it spoils his looks, though. Does it hurt, Machin? No. I don't feel anything. Take no notice of 'em, lad. Mr Slomer's your newest fan. You seem to have the kind of charm that appeals to him. I've noticed I'm not the only person who's found something of interest in Frank. (WEAVER) What do you mean by that? (SLOMER) Well, Gerald, there was even a time when you were very impressed by him. I carried that boy. It was on my back, nobody else's. Are you trying to tell me that you've carried me, or something? Yes... from the very beginning. I've played myself into that crumby team. But you just don't appreciate how much help you've had, Frank. Look, am I a good footballer, or am I not? The only reason you're in that team now is because Mr Slomer wants you there. (SLOMER) Oh, come now, Ann. Anyway, I think Frank's had enough for one day. Oh, I see by my onion it's 11:30. Time to be going. I like to see Christmas in at home. Don't bother to come down. The young man 'll see that I don't get into any trouble from your revellers. Merry Christmas. Tell me, Frank... have you been indulging in what I call 'Mrs Weaver's weakness for social in formalities'? Is that your business? That's for you to decide. No. You've been having a good season so far, Frank. - Until today. - Huh? Until today. Oh! I see what you mean. Still, false teeth can be better looking than the real thing sometimes. What do you think mine are? They look very neat. Are they false or real? False, but they could be real. They're false. You're in a tricky position with Weaver, you know. I know he hasn't liked me for a bit. He thought he had some sort of ownership over you. He just doesn't like to see it taken away. Still... you'll be all right as long as I'm there. Do you understand what I mean? Aye. Right. Well... I wish you Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. You're Frank Machin, aren't you? You look different on the field... like a tiger. You look pale. Aren't you well? Am I a good footballer? Let's go upstairs and find an empty room, eh? (REVELLERS SINGING) 'Oh, he's a jolly good fellow.' 'For he's a jolly good fellow.' 'For he's a jolly good fellow... and so say all of us.' 'And so say all of us.' 'For he's a jolly good fellow.' 'For he's a jolly good fellow and so say all of us.' 'And so say all of us, and so say all of us.' 'For he's a jolly good fellow.' 'For he's a jolly good fellow...' '...and so say all of us.' Hip, hip! Hurray! Hip, hip! Hurray! (REVELLERS SINGING) Weaver... you're a fifth-rate gutless quack! (REVELLERS SINGING) '...He'd kick hard, and I'd kick hard, we'd all kick hard together...' (TRAIN WHISTLES) (TRAIN SCREAMS PAST) (MRS HAMMOND) It's late. (MRS HAMMOND) Have you only just got back? Frank, are you all right? Aye. Aye. I see you've had a visitor. Two. Nobody you know. Who might that be? Don't get so hoity. Just because you don't know everybody in my life. It was Eric's sister and her husband. I didn't know he had one. Here. What do you think of that? What is it? Is that... is that you? It was before I met Eric. When was that, then? Oh, just at the end of the war. We worked in an ordnance factory, making bombs. You should have seen us. All women. We had some times. You weren't married then? No. Had some chaps, though. We had some good fun together. Aye... I bet you gave them a right run around. Tell no stories, tell no lies. Good God, Frank what have you done? I-I don't look too good, do I? I've aged ten years... d'you reckon? What have you been doing? Have you been fighting? No, I got them broken. The dentist pulled out the bits. Six bits, ten guineas. I'm in the wrong bloody business. It's spoilt your looks. So I've been told. By a girl? Who else worries about me? You went to Weaver's, then? Aye. You look ill, Frank. You oughtn't to have been out. Here, what am I going to do... with the, the presents for the kids? Go on, go on, go on. Well... I'll take them up with me and put them in their stockings. And I've... I've got yours here, an' all. You shouldn't have bothered. D'you want it now? What is it? Well, take it. No, no... leave it till the morning. Don't spoil it. Will you put the light out? I'd never have guessed you made bombs. Why... why don't you come to bed with me? It'll be cold and I need looking after. Thou knows Mother always goes to bed with Santa. All right. But just for Christmas, mind? All right, I'll make it... five quid. Oh, watch your step, now. Five quid? Come on, it's only money. He's worried. You've got him worried, Maurice. 'Course, he's a family man now, you know. Aye, but whose bloody family, eh? (LAUGHTER) Stuff it, love, or I'll belt you right across that back seat! Now, now... just because we've got Frank in a corner... All right, Maurice. We'll see what you're made of. There's ten quid there. - Oh, bloody hell... - Ah, stop the bus, I'm getting off here! I though you said you were a friend of mine? I am a friend of yours... I've given you all the money, haven't I? All right, I'll see you for ten quid. What have you got? Nothing much. Two pair... of kings! Ah, bloody hell! I'd have bet the whole stinking bus on 'em! I'm not greedy, Maurice. Thirty quid's enough. She'll murder me. Who, Judith? - She bloody will an' all. - Tell her it went to charity. (KEN) You lucky bleeder! Is that what you call it? (KEN) It bloody is. - Come on, Ken, do you want a hand? - I might as well. I hope you know what you're doing with the cash. I can take care of it, Len. Aye, but can it take care of thee? Get stuffed, love. (FRANK) Margaret! I'm coming. (FRANK) Come on down, I've got something to show you. We won't be back too late, Mrs Farrer. Oh, all right. Look here, why don't you pop out and get yourself something? It's all right, Mr Machin. All right, I'll leave it here for you, then. Here she is. Do you like it? It's beautiful, love. Oh, thanks. Wait a minute, wait a minute... What? What's the mat... Let's put this on, just for a change. Oh, no, Frank. It's yours. It's here, it's nobody else's. Don't be so silly, Frank, it... I want you to have it. Look, it won't bite. Frank, I can't! Well, I can't wear it. Now, come on. Come on. Oh... Just for tonight, then. Aye. Just for tonight. At least that's a start. Erm... we won't be back late, Mrs Farrer. Mm. All right, love. Bye-bye for now, then. Ta-ra. Bye-bye. (SOFT PIANO MUSIC) I'm afraid this table's reserved, sir. Hah, you're right, it is reserved. For us. I'm sorry, sir, there is a nice table... Look, why don't you get lost, love? We could have gone to another table. He was only doing his job. His what? You call that a job? Traipsing about like a fifty-year old tart? Oh, thank you. Good evening, madam. Oh, good evening, Mrs Weaver. Mr Weaver. Nice to see you again. - Hello, Tom. Keeping well? - Very well, thank you, sir, and you? Er, will you be going straight in, sir, or will you order in the bar? Yes... yes, I think we'll have a drink first. (BARMAN) Good evening, madam. Hello, Bruce. And to follow, madam? Er, bird? Duckling's nice this evening. Or meat... a nice steak? Er, have you any roast meat? Roast beef, madam. Yes, and... some vegetables? Cauliflower and roast potatoes. Thank you very much, madam. And for you, sir? Well, let's have a look. I'll have, er... a nice piece of steak... blood rare some cabbage and some potatoes. Er, no soup, sir? Aye, I'll have some soup but make sure there's plenty of it. Thank you very much, sir. Er, anything to drink? - Yes, I think we'll have... - I'll send the wine waiter over, sir. Well, what the bloody hell did you ask me for? I bet he comes back with a bit of fried egg and bacon! Watch you don't burn his whiskers, love! Ha, ha, ha! You shouldn't have come here if you're going to behave like this. We're paying for it aren't we? That's all they're interested in. No, it's not. But if you're going to act like a pig... Well, if I'm a pig, what's this load of fat bastards around here, then? Frank, I've told you. Now, enjoy yourself... that's what this place is for. I know how to handle these people. How's it going, love? Have they burnt your custard? Really! These old ladies, you know they're a bit past it. (WEAVER) ...well, he didn't know quite what to say. - Would you care to order now, sir? - Oh, thank you. Mrs Weaver. Your table is already reserved for you, sir. Thank you very much, Thomas. Isn't that Frank Machin down there? I don't think she's getting quite what she expected. No... but then, does anybody with Machin? Give us the bill, love. We're leaving. Yes, sir. - Can I have the fur coat, please? - Yes, madam. Poor thing, I feel almost sorry for her. Is there anything wrong, sir? I don't mind paying for what we haven't had, but has he added it up right? I don't think your mate's very good at his sums. I don't think there's any mistake, sir. - Are you sure, now? - Quite, sir. Right. Good, I just wanted to make certain. Er... this is for your trouble. Be careful how you spend it. Thank you, sir. Hello, Mr Weaver. (MRS FARRER) Good night, Mr Machin. That was Mrs Weaver, wasn't it, at the restaurant? Aye. Aren't you friends anymore? Who with? Them. No, I... I've got no need for them. Are you coming up? Yes... in a minute. (CHEERING) Well, Frank, they've got a nice day for it. Aye. Are you feeling fit for Saturday? - Champion, Mr. Slomer. - That's the way. We can't manage without Frank, you know. Congratulations. I hope you'll both be very happy. Aren't you going to kiss her? Go on. I won't be a second, Margaret. Congratulations, Maurice. Best of luck. Look after her. Thank you very much. Well done, Judith. See he keeps up to it, and no backsliding. Ah Frank. Thanks, Frank. Oh, hello, Mr Slomer, how are you? Margaret! What's the matter? Why'd you run off like that? In front of all those people, and... that young girl. It makes me ashamed. Ashamed! I'm a kept woman, Frank, how else do you expect me to feel? Oh, my God. It's no good, Frank. That car, me all dressed up in a fur coat, living in the same house as you. If you deal with dirt, you look dirty. People have got eyes, you know. Oh... You feel like dirt? What do you think? It sounds like you want to shove me off to some other woman. I don't need to do that, do I? From what I hear, you're never short of girls. Well, if you think that, why do you stick with me still? I reckon you'll leave me soon. Well, that's the first I've ever heard of it; me leaving. I know how you are. I thought you were beginning to feel happy. Happy? I could say something there, but I won't. Well, go on, say it. I'd like to hear you say it; I'd like to hear you say all of it. You don't understand at all, do you? (MUSIC ON TELEVISION) You can always sell it if you're so sure I'm leaving. You can open a shop soon with all the stuff I've bought you. You've given us nothing you haven't had to. You don't seem to understand the reason I've done these things for you. Of course I do. It makes you feel good, it makes you feel big. You know how you like to feel big. You don't appreciate one bloody thing I've done for you. I've given you a life! A life better than any other woman in this street, but you will not admit it! Admit it? You must be mad. I can't lift my head up in the street without somebody pointing at me and saying I'm your slut! Who says that? 'Who says that?' Just listen to him! They all laugh at you, they all point you out, don't you know that? Trying to be different! And they point me out too, and Ian and Lynda. We're not proper people now because of you. Because you show off every Saturday in front of thousands of them, because you're... you're just a great ape on a football field. Because you want me to be like them! You want me to crawl about just like the rest. Well, just have a look at the rest. Take a right good look at 'em. Take a right good look at the bloody people round here. There isn't a bleeding man amongst 'em. You're flat on your backs, and the world crawls above you! Because they haven't the guts. Do you understand that? They haven't the guts to stand up and to walk about like me! Shout as much as you like, but just get out of here. I don't want you in my house anymore. You know you need me. Why don't you admit it? Leave me alone! I won't leave you alone, not until you admit it! Margaret, what's the matter? Margaret? Leave me alone. Aren't you well? Can't you get it into your head? We don't need you. I don't understand her. I don't understand what she wants from me. 'A great ape on a football field'. That's what she called me. A great ape on a football field! That's about what we are, isn't it? (FRANK) She makes me feel like that. She makes me feel clumsy... awkward, and big, and... stupid. She makes me feel like... she makes me feel like... I crush... I... I crush everything. Maybe you're too rough on her. Some women can't stand it, you know. (1ST MAN) Hallo, Frank. (2ND MAN) Hallo, Maurice. I say, you took a bit of a knock last week! I reckon it takes something to lay you out! Aye, see you do better next Saturday! (THEY LAUGH) That's what they think of me, isn't it? A great ape on a football field. They want someone to act big, because they haven't got the guts to do it themselves. They want a hero, and I am; I am a hero. But she won't admit it. Do you understand that? She needs me, Maurice, but she will not admit it. That's all right. But you can't be like that to a... to a woman. Maurice... Maurice, I'm... I'm not going to be a footballer forever. I need something... for good. Something permanent. And you reckon it's her? Grab my hand. I can love someone, can't I? I can, can't I? I can. Perhaps she's the wrong one. I need her. She's the one thing that makes me feel wanted. I can't lose her. (FRANK) You'd better see a doctor. I'm just tired. Are you going now or in the morning? I'm not going at all. What is it you want to make you go? I want nothing that you've got. I'm staying. Thank God there's one part of my life you've never touched. You mean Eric? He's the one thing you can't touch. And he's the one really good thing. Well, let's all get down on our knees and pray for the good soul of Eric Hammond... the father of this house! How he must hurt you! Well, come on, come on, then... let's put his bloody boots right back in the hearth! You don't know. You don't know. You don't know. If I've seen a crazy thing in my life, that's it. I know enough about you to keep you in a rubber room for the rest of your life! You know nothing about Eric, or me. You know nothing about Eric! I know he put the file through his guts. And you made him so happy, he went and killed himself! Do you want to kill me? Eric is dead, you understand? Eric is dead. You make me feel I'm nothing. - I want you. - You want to crush me, but I won't let you. Because I'm the one thing you can't have, like everything else! - I want you. - I want you to go. I need you. I want you to go! I want you to go! I want you to go... (SHE SOBS) Get out! - Margaret. - Get out! Oh, please! Please, leave me alone. I can't. Leave me alone. I can't. I can't. I love you. I want you to go! All right, I'm going. And that's the last you'll ever see. You're not in any trouble, are you? Oh, I'll take your word for it. Don't mind who I take, I'm not choosy. (LOUD BURST OF LAUGHTER) (CAMERON) But any trouble and no, thank you. (CAMERON) That's why I gave you that queer look when you came in just now. (CAMERON) I always give that look when I think people might cause trouble. (CAMERON) I find it puts them off. Does Johnson still live here? (CAMERON) He went a while ago. This is yours. You'll be all right here, Whacker. You got a lock on that? You'll be all right. These two alarm clocks are nippy, but they're nice when you know 'em. (IRISHMAN) Down here for a holiday? (CHILDREN SHOUTING OUTSIDE) (CAMERON) By the by, is that your car out there? I meant to tell you, Whacker, the nippers are mustard round here. It'll be all spare parts if you leave it too long. If you want it cleaning I'll do it for a dollar. (FACTORY SIREN SOUNDS) (IRISHMAN) Ah, you'll be all right, now... you'll be all right. Come on, then... let's get you to bed... (IRISHMAN) Is that you? (IRISHMAN) Is that you, Frank? (LITHUANIAN COUGHS AND RETCHES) (IRISHMAN) You dirty bastard! (CAR HORN BEEPS) (MRS FARRER) Mr Machin? Mr Machin. If it's Mrs Hammond, she's been taken ill. She's in the hospital. I've got Lynda and Ian with me. What? Mrs Hammond... she's been taken ill. What is it? It's an attack. Some sort of an attack.
