Let's carry on. ... down the walls. Mum? What's the matter? The oldest son of the family, Kamal Wasaki, is a repeat offender from Molenbeek in Brussels. He disappeared several months ago following the discovery of drugs in the family garage, which he ran. Known as DJ KAWAS, he's a local celebrity. He reappeared in Syria last autumn, as an aid worker. He appears in this ISIS video in which Assad's soldiers are executed in cold blood. It has been decided not to show the video in full because of its shocking nature. He said he was going to do GOOD things! I know. Check out this link. Today we slit the throats of Bashar Assad's soldiers in Al-Nasiriyah.

A senior UN official had strong words to say this week. He estimates that 11,000 people have been tortured and starved to death, something never seen before. Hey, bros, the emir isn't picking up.

It belongs to our people. Stop that right now. I won't let you leave here, I swear. Hamza is right. Don't come back, you've taken all there is. Hamza... Barak Obama confirmed there will be a response... - Salaam Alaikum. - Alaikum Salaam. We can't accept a world where women, children and innocent civilians are gassed on such a terrible scale. In Syria the speeches of Western leaders who are helping... Everyone's ordering before me. Chef, no olives, please. - I didn't like it much last time. - This will be with samurai sauce. - It's always a problem. - That's the old man talking. While in the country the army loyal to the Syrian president accuses the rebels and the media of lying about its role in events and denies involvement in the chemical... I'm here to eat Not watch the news Reported by overpaid clowns Coming up next Nice weather ahead Cousin, add a bit more, maybe I will like it. Amateur footage of the bombing affected people throughout the world. Given the emotions aroused in the international community, an attack seems to be increasingly likely. The question is where and when. I take back what I said Why do I see those oxygen masks? Mothers suffocating on the sidewalk A kid lifeless on the ground in the skirmish Fucking hell, I'm so embarrassed I want to hop on my ride And shoot the place up Nobody move, I am horrified There's smoke all around My meat will burn with the rest I'm there on the battlefield 3,222 kilometres away The government does nothing Just pester those with no jobs Squeezing our drivers dry Sending help is what they won't do Bashar the cursed Even Voldemort applauds you Killing kids is just what you do My blood boils when that's what I see There are angels in heaven Who protect Ghouta from these fiends Dude, I'm screaming shut your trap Hear the words of this real man The scumbags fire the gas You stop breathing, they tase you Known for their mass killing The system used by our cops Pray in peace we can't do We're stopped and searched at 13 Is it surprising we smoke weed? Take up arms and abandon the ones I hold dear Sorry, Mum At dawn I'll be gone Lullaby, get out of my head I need to hear the words of Allah instead Turn off the TV! Give me my shish The mood is so heavy now They're happy as the body count rises Then ratings also rise too All I see here is the smoke Just the shishas and the freeloaders Don't be surprised if we leave These dogs won't dictate to me So I'll go Look at the dead who left for Ghouta You don't give a shit It's far away and won't affect you I want to help all my brothers 'Cause the injustice is real They shoot at the unarmed Kill those who oppose and wake up From their dream This wasn't the life they imagined We will be judged for doing nothing Despite seeing it all The West just pisses on us No worries, though, it's fine You just like our sweet pastries Chebakia with poison You fucking son of a bitch Your little brother is here. Go and see. What's this? What are you doing here? Said he was my brother, arsehole. - I've told you not to talk like that. - What are you doing here all alone? - Got a problem with it? Everybody says I'm a child, it pisses me off! - Nassim, you are a child. - I'm not! You just thought: I'll go to the club and the doorman will just let me in? Yeah, sure. Yeah. That's because you're my brother. Hey guys! Look who came to visit. The maestro himself. My little brother. Pitchi, give me a helmet. The smallest one. I'll take this kid home. See you guys soon. Have a good night. - Say goodbye. - Goodbye! - Goodbye, Nassim. - You're naughty. - Fuck! - Stop. Police! Stay down. Stay down. - The passenger. - Hands where we can see them. - There's a child on the ground. - Police, stop! - Stop. - Stop, police! It's a kid. Don't move. Don't move. Positive. POLICE SEALED - DO NOT ENTER Come on. Kamal. You alright? Show me. - Doesn't hurt too much? - Go to your room, Nassim. - Mum. - Go to your room. I need to talk to your brother. You're my son. I love you. But you're no longer welcome here. You've decided to throw your life away? Fine. Go ahead. I won't hold you back anymore. But you're not taking your brother with you. I won't let you do that. Now go and say goodbye to him, then get out of my house. You should take this. - For the garage. - You can keep your dirty money! One day, you'll be proud of me. You'll see me in a different way. I promise you. I look forward to that day, Kamal. Kid... Are you alright? - I'm sorry. - Sorry for what? For the accident. And especially for leaving you with those fucking cops. Doesn't matter. I would've run off too. You traitor. You little traitor! Before, there was Dad and then there was me. Now you're the man of the house. It's your job to take care of Mum. Why do you say that? - I'm going away for a while, bro. - Where to? No. No, please. Stay with me and Mum. - Stay. - Don't worry, don't worry. Don't worry. Come here! One day, you'll understand, Allah willing. One mistake And your heart grows dark With no light in your soul You could not feel what you should - Al-Almani! - Welcome to Raqqa! Salaam Alaikum! Salaam Alaikum! - Dear family from Raqqa. - This is our place! Allahu Akbar. Hello everybody. Today, we ask for your support for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. It will endure forever despite hypocrites and those who are secular! Lord, forgive us our sins and excesses in our behaviour. Make our feet firm and give us victory over the disbelieving people. Amen. Caliphate soldiers, the time has come For the Islamic State, we must fight Our young troops do not fear war Against an enemy who deserves to be tortured Our army's soldiers fight for Allah Paradise is in the shadow of the swords of jihad - Takbir. - Allahu Akbar. - Allahu Akbar. - Allahu Akbar. - Allahu Akbar. - Allahu Akbar. - Takbir. - Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar. If you are captured in combat, detonate your explosive vest. Next! - Name? - Kamal. - Country? - Belgium. Passport? Phone? Read this. - Better to capture than kill them. - Next! Why? Because it seems that enemies' wounds... I know how to shoot videos. I can help the film crew. I'm good at editing. Filming... Photos. That's not good. We need to fix it. - Hello. - Hello. Where are the cameras? - Behind you. - Thank you. We have to make the most of the cameras. Get it? Go on. Good luck. Canon 7D. Don't forget the lenses. - OK. - Cool. That's fine, Abu Bakr Al-Belgiki. There is no god but Allah. Mohammed is His Prophet. Allahu Akbar. If you do well, we will see you in paradise, brother. Is that OK? Let's go. Follow me. Come on. Stay with me the whole time, OK? Over there. Film that. Show me the map. The first group will leave heading north and two minutes later the second group will join them heading west. Now, get ready. Hey, Belgiki. Belgiki. Belgiki. Hey. - Is the drone ready? - Yes, it's ready. If it doesn't explode, blow it up yourself. - Understand? - Yes, fine. I want the video to look good. Give me the Tramadol. - Give me the money first. Thanks. No. Don't film that, OK? Is that clear? Come on. The cars. - This battle is crucial. - Get ready. We are right. They are wrong. Those are the gates to paradise. Check all the doors, one by one. If there are any injured, bring them back. - Allahu Akbar. - Allahu Akbar. First battalion, attack! Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar. - Allahu Akbar. - Allahu Akbar. Go for it, brothers, in the name of Allah! To jihad! What the fuck are you doing? Are you crazy? - You shot our men! - Sorry. Belgiki, come with me. Follow me. Follow me. And film! Do you hear me? Film everything. Let's go. Follow me. Abu Amar! Get up. Get up. Bring him over here. Thank you, brother. You saved my life. Show me. Show me what you've got. - Salaam. - Salaam. Wait. In the name of Allah. 1, 2, 3... OK. Hey, brother. Did you drive it into a grenade, bro? I can't perform miracles, you know. I'm only human. Look at this. This is ridiculous. - Belgium? - Yes. Antwerp. You? - Molenbeek, Brussels. - Crazy warriors in Molenbeek. There are a few minor issues with it. No coolant left. I think the battery is dead and the clutch has gone too. - What's your name? - Abu Bakr Al-Belgiki. No, not your honorific name. The name your mother gave you. - Kamal. - What? - Kamal Wasaki. - Kamal Wasaki. Like Kawasaki. You seem to know your bikes. My Kawasaki. Can you repair it? Allah willing, if He wants me to. What's up, bro? I saw a man get shot in the head. Got his fucking brains all over my face. So? What did you expect? Better to go quickly to heaven than slowly to hell, brother. I'm Olivier and I lost my son at the end of 2012. He left with Sami, Veronique's son. Unfortunately, he died a few months later. There you go. That's why we're all here. My name is Leisa. I also have a son who left in 2012. He was 19 years old. That's when I met Saliha, who shares my sorrow. We talk, we try to survive. That's all. They never found his body. We don't know where he died. He left three children behind over there. That's how it is. Belgian! Get in! Don't be afraid. I've got a present for you. Come on, get in. Let's go! - Let's go, infidels! - Infidels! Move, move! Move along. Get up there. Get up there. There. Where is she, the Sunnite? Bring me the Sunnite! - Look at this. - You'll see. - Is she here? - Yes, there. Bring her here. Is there a Sunni girl here? Where is the Sunni girl? Come with me, come forward. Go on! The photograph. Oh my God! Look, look! See the others over there? They're Yazidis, infidels. Have to be violated 12 times before they're converted. But that one is a Muslim. And she's still a virgin. She's yours, brother. Touch her. - How much? - 5,000. - 3,000. - No. Give me 4,000. Look, your future wife. Touch her. 4,200, final offer. Follow your husband. Just look at this mansion! Put him upstairs. - I'll show you the crime scene. - OK. See how those bastards lived? Not bad, eh? We're going to be fine now. Look at this chandelier. The first time I saw it, I got a massive hard-on. Here you go, your new room. Make yourself at home. Come here. - What's this? - Viagra. Tell me if you need anything else. We have everything. Coke, XTC, speed... Just come and find me and ask. Alright? - Good. Have fun. - OK. Take it easy. I just want the pillow. The pillow. I... I will sleep there. You can sleep in the bed. They call me Abu Bakr Al-Belgiki. Because I'm from Belgium. Where are you from? Dammit. My real name is Kamal. Kamal Wasaki. And you? What's your name? Tell me your name, please. Noor. Noor. Are you afraid of me? I'm not going to hurt you. I swear. I swear. What we were What we have become Our destinies have been linked So unexpectedly without our knowledge Look at these talented boys, just as Allah willed it. - Why aren't you playing? - Don't feel like it. I heard you're quite good. That's what he told me... your brother. You're Nassim, right? My name is Idriss. You know Kamal? - Of course. We're all proud of him. - Proud of what? Come here and I'll tell you. - I speak to Kamal all the time. - Really? Where is he? I'm not sure exactly. He moves around a lot. There's a war on there. - Can I talk to him? - You've got lots of questions, eh? That's only normal. It's normal. Salaam. I have to go. We'll chat again another time, OK? Don't let anybody tell you otherwise, your brother is a hero. May al-Ha'ir prison collapse completely Its foundations and buildings crumble to the ground Inside are people who will no longer break open its doors The prison of tyranny oppresses me I need help, oh my brave leader Attack like you did in Taji And the prison of Abu Grahib Our hero and commander I want to go to the Levant to fight the Alawites And bring their regime down Be in Islamic State, leave the reign of the House of Saud in Saudi Arabia I want to go to the Levant to fight the Alawites And bring their regime down Do you like it? I painted it specially for you. - Reminds me of my Ninja. - Really? Yeah, in Brussels I only rode Kawas! ZX10, Z1400... ZDX-L, ZDX-12R, blah blah blah. - Two or four cylinders? - Four, of course. - Acceleration? - 0 to 100 in 2.8 seconds. - OK, OK. - Top speed? 299, like a high-speed train. A Japanese high-speed train. You know your horses well. Those horses have to gallop, eh warrior? They'll break your fingers, I swear. - Eh? - Don't be smart. You like smoking cigarettes? So smoke. It's not what you think. You haven't got a cigarette? - They'll break my fingers. - That's true. Mustn't tempt the Devil. I stopped sixteen months ago. Thanks be to Allah. You haven't got a cigarette? Noor? Noor? Noor? Sorry. They want you to help at the hospital. Hey! Gloves! Put your gloves back on. I need to disinfect my hands to help the girl. She's my wife, she's with me. - Tell your wife to put gloves on. - OK. What can I do? What's the point of coming here? I can't do much. Listen, listen. Tell me what to do, OK? I'll be your hands. Tell me what I have to do and I'll do it. Disinfect your hands. Cut! - Where? - Cut her trousers, here! Disinfect the wound. Around the wound. You're going to be fine, sweetie. Put the needle in here. Slowly. Hold this. From this side to that side. Like this. Back and forth. Your first cry My greatest joy Since your first steps My blessing is being around you With you, standing by your side Your laughter and your sorrow Now I do not know your desires Nor your dreams or your wishes I don't know and I'm afraid... So you're a doctor. And a Sunni, right? Why were you at the slave market? That is not the law. Law? What law are you talking about? Do these monsters know the law? You should explain that law to the Yazidis. They don't understand the law like you do. They sold me to punish me. I was sold. I was recording. All the evil that they were doing. They took me. My entire family was executed. May Allah bless them. I'm sorry for what they did to you. And to your family. - You're one of them. - No. You don't know me. - I'm just filming here. - You're filming atrocities. Murders for their propaganda. Shame on you. You're a coward. I'm just trying to survive. Like you. Hind, where are you? Oh, it's you, Nassim. We're off to get something to eat. Want to come? Where are you going? If you had to choose between eating a sheep's brain or its balls, which would you choose? - Its brain, of course. - No. Are you kidding? Nassim, what would you choose? - The brain. - There you go. The brain. Of course. - Hello, madam. Vegetables? - Yes, please. Do you want some couscous, sir? - Vegetables? Nassim, give him some. - The bottle of water. - Some more? - There you go. Here you go. And remember, we are doing this for the community, sir. Here you go. Isn't it dangerous to smoke near all these bombs? Don't think about it. If you got hold of cigarettes, maybe you could get passports too? Are you being serious? It's very dangerous to ask for a passport. I want to leave. It's simple. Kamal, who doesn't want to leave here? Patience, brother. I could shoot myself in the leg so I don't have to fight. That's dumb, don't do it. Injured fighters have to drive suicide cars. So what about you then? Two bullets. I'm shitting in a bag for now. Thanks be to Allah for my talent for repairing motorbikes. Kawasaki, Kawasaki. Suppose I did arrange passports? You'd still have to go through checkpoints to reach Tell Abyad and the YPG. Do you know that or not? Do you want to go for a walk? Where? To somewhere in Raqqa? Show me your city. Can I choose? Yeah. My roots are in Morocco. Have you been to Morocco? - Yes. - Yes? And? Nice. Nice, that's all? Morocco is the best country in the world. So why didn't you stay there? My father is from Safi. My mother is from Tanger. My mother makes the best tagine with plums and meat. - Have you got brothers and sisters? - A brother. Nassim, younger than me. He's 12 years old. When he was a child... He couldn't read and I gave him... Harissa. You know what harissa is? And I told him it was toothpaste. That's mean. It was a joke. He's my little brother, I can have a joke with him. But I didn't expect him to do it for real, you know? I felt guilty, I swear. I miss him. Syrian is very different from Moroccan dialect. It's not the same language. How do you say, for example, tea? - Shai. - Shai. Would you like some tea? Atay... Atay... - Shai. - Shai. How do you say this? - Kalbi. - Kalbi. Do you know how we say it in Moroccan dialect? Kalbi. - It's the same. - It's the same? Yes. Nobody here. Take it off. Trust me. Just take it off. You need to hear "chack". First... and slowly... And then second... Like when you drive a car. Your eyes are your brain. Your brain is your hands. Understand? - Yeah... - Yeah? Now you drive. Trust yourself. I trust you. OK, you've got this. Slowly, slowly. Yes. Like that. Yes! Fix on a point. Your eyes are your brain. Your brain is your hands. OK? Say "bismillah". - Bismillah. - Come on. Slowly. Yes. Yes. Yes. Slowly, yes. Yes, yes. Slowly, slowly! OK, OK. Yes, yes. Again, again. Slowly, slowly. What is this? You dog! - This music is porn for the ears. - It's my livelihood! Go on. - Please. - Be quiet. - No, no. - Smash it all. Please, don't kill me. I'm not an infidel. Shut up. Look at the fucking crap he had hidden. They're not mine, I swear. I don't know whose they are. Shoot him right now. - No, no, in the name of Allah. - Have mercy! We have orders. Don't shoot. We have to bring him in. - What the fuck is your problem? - Don't shoot. We have orders. That's all we have. Fucking arsehole! You're crazy! I think you're a faggot. Throw him from a rooftop. Come on. - To resist, we must remain united - United I heard there was a problem? I was just following the rules. - Yes. You did well. But above all, always keep the faith... Look, do you notice anything? No. They're black, Brazilian, Chechen, Turkish... All brothers. This brotherhood is our strength. That's why you must act strong in front of your brothers. Do you understand what I'm saying? You can't look weak. Never. Thanks be to Allah. Peace be upon Prophet Mohammad, His people and His friends. Today we slit the throats of Bashar Assad's soldiers in Al-Nasiriyah. And tomorrow we kill the soldiers from the west who support Bashar Assad in Al-Nasiriyah. - Takbir. - Allahu Akbar. Beautiful, great work! All fire at the same time. And you, listen to me carefully. When you talk about the army from the west, - look at the camera. - OK. Over there. Understood? Alright, let's go. Move that over there. Just a bit, just a bit. Great. Install the dolly, quickly! - What's that? - Come on! - Camera there! - We haven't much time. Put it over there. - How's it going? - Very well. - Come with me. - It's ready. - You gave them tramadol? - Don't worry, they're fine. - Are you sure? - Yes. Show me. Closer. Very good. Let's change the programme. It will be a big day for you. - A big day? - Yes. Abduallah, remove the third one in the line, please. Him. Come on. Him? Go on. You will put his uniform on and take his place. - What? - Don't you get it? You're going to be in this video. Either as executioner or condemned man, you can choose. Look, he's in the frame too much, tell him to back off. - Him? - Yes. Move him back. You with the boom, move! Go on, go on. And... action. In the name of Allah the Merciful. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Universe. May prayers and peace be upon our prophet Mohammad, His people and His friends. Today we slit the throats of Bashar Assad's soldiers in Al-Nasiriyah. And tomorrow we kill the soldiers from the west who support Bashar Assad in Al-Nasiriyah. - Takbir! - Allahu Akbar! For you and me and for humanity Like yesterday, every day a destiny is decided The soldiers that support you will be... Did you see that woman? Her son left for Syria. He took my computer. He'll give it back to you. Here. This is for you. Thanks. Brother Kamal, I've got something to ask you. See my friend here? Abu Nasser, from France. He has been at the front, he fought heroically. - My respect, my friend. - Thank you. Are you OK? Al hamdullah, thank you. And that is why he'd like to buy your wife off you. - No, that's not possible. - Why not? She's my wife. It's against the law, sharia. I understand that but we'll compensate you extremely well. You can buy your wife back the day after. Come on, bro. Look at him. Sorry, I can't do it. Abu Nasser will return to the front next week. As a martyr this time. You should do this for him. Brother, please? Allah bless him, but it's impossible. - Allah be with you. - Allah bless you. What was it like growing up without your dad? Can't have been easy. It was OK. He died when I was three. He's not really dead, you know. He's in paradise. You'll see him again there. I guess. Paradise is a magnificent place, Nassim. A great place. It's like Allah said, it is what He promised us. The land that belongs to us. There will be gardens and streams as far as the eye can see. It's really beautiful there. You can't imagine. Do you know what this is? - It's the key to paradise. - Yeah, right. I'm serious, Nassim. It's the key to paradise. And I want you to hold on to it for me. Keep it safe. You see, Nassim. This life we lead on earth... It is of no value. It's just a path... a gateway to paradise. If you make the right choice, like Kamal did. Noor? Noor? Suffering Silently Nobody cares Who decided I have to give up my rights? Saw my dignity disappear Didn't see where my freedom went Don't know where my rights were disposed of I am wronged, I still endure and why? Afraid and hiding my fear I kept quiet though I was in pain Overnight what have I become? And how? Eyes do not dry up Body bleeds from its wounds Soul, how can you still be forgiving? Destroyed country Homeless people I'm screaming My name, my body My thoughts, my honour You took everything from me You didn't leave me anything Let me go my way Islam is a religion of love, of respect, tolerance and fraternity and not a religion of hate, intolerance and fanaticism. Despite that, brothers and sisters among us succumb to this excess. Good people can commit terrible sins. And bad people... Apologize to Allah! You're talking bullshit! That is not Islam! You will burn in hell! Calm down, it's alright, sit down. - Sit down, brothers. - What's going on? Sit down, everything is fine. Thanks be to Allah. How's things? Fine? Feeling better? I'm OK. How about you? What was that, what did he want? Don't be scared. These people... May Allah protect them. Hind! - Want to hang out this weekend? - Yeah, why not? No, this weekend won't be possible. It's your uncle's wedding. - But not all weekend? - Come on. Bye, Leila. Yusuf. - Do you know them? - No. I don't want you to talk to them at the mosque, OK? Come on. Pass it! - But why can't I play? - We're not playing with you. Why? - Get lost! - He pushed me! You did that on purpose, arsehole. You're an arsehole. Calm down! Stop it! Come on! Come here! Stop it. Calm down! - Did you see what he did? - Forget it. He's an arsehole. - Leave him alone! - Did you see? You're brother is a fucking terrorist. Stop it. Calm down, stop it. There's no point. Hey, hey, hey, guys. Guys. Nassim. Nassim, come with me. - Stop, stop. - Dickhead! Bitch! No, no, no, no. We have to go. Papers, ID? What's your reason for going there? My wife has breast cancer, they can't treat her here. OK, they can go through. Hello? Go ahead, you can pass. Go on, you can pass. Remove the spikes. Stop them, stop that bike! - I can't drive. - What are you doing? - I can't drive. - You're crazy! Kamal! Kamal, don't stop! You can drive. You have to go. You have to go. - Kamal, get on! - Go! I can't drive. - Kamal, no! - Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! - You can't escape. - Surrender now! Careful. I'll follow you on the left. Go on, reload. - Go on, shoot, shoot, shoot. - Oh, wait. - Fucking infidels. - Yeah! See, I told you. It's like your mum. She watches the news on TV too. She knows. But what does she do to change things? - Nothing. - Exactly, nothing. - Watch out. - Fuck, sniper! Wow, look at that. You saved my life. You have to understand, Western media are focusing on purpose on what we're doing wrong, but behind their lies is the truth. And the truth is Kamal didn't kill anyone. He executed someone. One of Assad's soldiers. A huge difference. Do you know what those soldiers, those cowards did? The arseholes attacked a Muslim town in the middle of the night. They shot all the men, took all the women, all the young girls and raped them all one by one, brother. While the others were watching. Can you imagine? Imagine that happening to someone you love? A sister or your own mother, Nassim. How would you have reacted? My brother, Abu Bakr the Belgian, what is this bullshit? You really disappoint me. Go on! Today you will die by my hands! I swear. Carry on. I swear I will bury you here today. Allah is great. Oh fuck, piss off. Watch out. - Who are you talking to so early? - Hind. - Hind? At this time in the morning? - Yeah. Put your Playstation away and come and have breakfast. I'm off to work. I want your teacher to call me every day when you get to school. No, Mum, that sucks. Would you rather I come and see for myself? Which sucks the most? Leave the Playstation alone and come and have breakfast. Shit. You know your problem? You're like them. - Don't know the real story. - What real story? Islamic State aren't the bad guys. What they say on TV is rubbish. - What you're saying is rubbish. - It's the truth! They set up schools, hospitals, give money... - Then it's alright to kill people? - But they kill our people too! Our people? Who told you that? Idriss? You shouldn't hang out with them. They've got a screw loose. That video is gross. You saw it, didn't you? You don't know the real story! How many times must I say? What real story? Your brother killed someone. - Fuck you. - Whatever. - Block it. Block it. - That's it, come on. Block it, I said. Change, change, come on! Good, my friends, good. Hi, little brother. Have you still got that key? Sure. Right here. There, I knew it. I knew I could count on you, trust you. Like your brother. - I spoke to him recently. - What did he say? He talks about you a lot. He wants to see you. He'd like you to join him there. - He really said that? - Yes, brother. - I arranged a Skype call with him. - Really? - Of course, next week. - Isn't that your mum over there? Oh shit. Fuck. Nassim, what are you doing here? We gave clothes and food to the poor. - Great. But you didn't go to school. It's true. Each week we organise... I didn't ask you anything, I'm talking to my son. OK? - Come with me. - Listen to your mother, Nassim. He doesn't need your permission. I know. Nassim makes his own choices. Do you think I'm stupid? I know what you're up to. I'm not up to anything. We were just talking. Oh yeah? Talking? Talking about what to my son? I'd be interested to know. You think you're quite something. Madam, with all due respect, you don't know... Leave my son alone. Next time, I'm calling the cops. Understood? Come on. - Let go, I'm not a child anymore. - Yes, you are. You're my child. I told you not to talk to him. There you go, go on. Jab, go on. Up the pace, guys. Up the pace. Nassim. Nassim! Come back. I've not finished talking to you. Nassim! Can we talk? Nassim. I understand you're angry and sad about your brother. I am too, you know. I... I know I haven't been perfect either. I made plenty of mistakes with him. I don't want to make the same mistakes with you. Do you understand? D'you hear? D'you understand? I don't want the same thing to happen to you. Look at me. Nassim, look at me. Look at me. Don't see this as difficult behaviour but as committing to him. Enter into a dialogue with him again. What do you mean by enter into a dialogue with him again? I want to enter into a dialogue with my son again but... One son has already left. Plus Nassim is a child. We can't lock up a child. I'm not asking you to lock up my son. I'm asking... what can you do for him before it's too late? It seems to me, and I could be mistaken, that... you want me to watch my son become radicalised while I try to enter into a dialogue. I don't understand. I'm asking you to arrest the recruiter who's brainwashing him. That is what I'm asking. The same goes for the recruiter. We can't imprison him, there's no proof. I understand, but... I really think I might lose my child. I don't recognise him anymore. So, besides entering into a dialogue, what else can I do? That's why I'm here. We're doing everything we can. What do you think? You want to know what I think? I think you find it very convenient that all those kids go to Syria. That's what I think. And it makes sense. It means fewer Arabs to deal with. But one day, some of them will return and blow themselves up here. What will you say then? Allah willing, let me talk to Nassim, I can try to help. Nassim. Salaam Alaikum. How are you? - What's he doing here? - I invited Yusuf round for some tea. You don't mind, do you? Your mum says you've been struggling. You have lots of questions you seek answers to. Is it true? - No, it's not. - Nassim, sit down, please. I know it's hard to talk about such a sensitive subject. Can I go to my room now? No, you will stay and listen to Yusuf. - I don't want to. - Nassim. Stop it. Leave him, I'll talk to him. Give me a few minutes, please. Thank you. You miss him, don't you? - What? - I can imagine you miss Kamal. It must hurt, to see your brother judged by people who don't know him. Every day you wonder what you should do. Don't you? Maybe we should focus first on the things we're sure of. I'm 100% sure that your mother loves you more than anything else. - Do you believe that? - I guess. The Prophet forbids abandoning one's own mother. It's haram, it's written in the Koran. There once was a man who came to the Prophet and asked His permission to take part in jihad. "I want to take part in jihad for Allah's cause." And the Prophet asked him: "Is your mother still alive?" He said: "Yes, thanks be to Allah." The Prophet replied: "Stay with her, for paradise is beneath her feet." Do you understand, Nassim? No jihad is worth more than your mother. - 25 euros. - No, 15. - 15? 20. - 15. It's all I can afford. - OK, 15. - 15. Maybe I'll take the other two too. Give me a price for all three. Do you like the black one, Nassim? The black one is nice. And the red one? Yeah? Tonight 11p.m. 60 Le Lorrain Street Nassim. The key? See? When I make a promise, I keep it. Come in. Have a seat, Nassim. Let's see if we have a connection... There! Kamal! Can you hear me? How are you doing? Are those bullets I can see? Hello, little brother. Are you injured? I'm a soldier, it will heal. Don't worry. Are you fighting in the war? I'm fighting the infidels and the injustice they're committing. I'm fighting for the good cause. May Allah protect me. I talked a lot about you Kamal, about the noble fight you're fighting. He told me you're doing good things there. I understand why you killed that man, I know the real story now. Kamal, if only you knew what you represent for young people here. For the hood, the cause. You're important to us. Especially to your brother here. You're his hero. Yes, really, Kamal. I want to come and be with you. Nassim. How is Mum doing? If you agree, I'll come. Mum will understand. - Are you sure? - I want to be with you, Kamal. No! No! Go on. Go on. Go on. Nassim? Are you alright? You're cold. It will be alright. Do you want me to sing you a song? Like I used to? Sing you to sleep? Your first cry My greatest joy Since your first steps My blessing is being around you As I walk next to you Your smile and your tears Miss. Where is Hind? Her parents asked for her to be moved to another class. Now I don't know your desires Nor your dreams or your wishes I don't know and I'm afraid Of what you're hiding in your heart Your youth is still to be lived to the full Before you spread your wings and fly Nassim. Little brother. How are you? Ready to join the lions cubs of the caliphate? Come on then. - You're not coming? - To each his task, little brother. Mine is here. Make me happy I love you I bless you and pray for you Get up, get up! Get up, coward! Go on, move! Watch. Watch carefully! - Allahu Akbar. - No. See love become affection Know that hate becomes destruction Yes, of course, madam. He's a Belgian citizen, we have to help you here at the ministry. But you know that country is at war. We don't have any diplomats or armed forces there. If he were in Iraq, we could do something. But in this case the situation is complicated, I'm sorry. I'm just ensuring you shower for the party. Show me your face. Water, water, water. - As you can see, it's just water. - Get up! - Come on. Water! Water! - No! Come on. It's going to be alright. OK? Have a nice trip, bro! Go this way. Kamal. - Salaam Alaikum. - Alaikum Salaam. Sorry, brother. I'm sorry. You have to get out of here, brother. Quickly, leave! Don't say that, Al-Belgiki, you're scaring him! - Kamal. - You're hurting him. Let him go. Let him go! - Get away from here. It'll all be fine, Nassim. You'll be fine. Get away. Don't worry, he was injured in a battle. We'll take good care of him. Don't you want a swim? It's nice weather. Kamal. Heaven is our goal Heaven is our destiny Heaven is our dream of eternal life Heaven is our goal Heaven is our destiny Heaven is our dream of eternal life Oh righteous believer I believe too Strive, multiply your good deeds - Allahu akbar! - Allahu akbar!

Where is your gun? Where is your gun? Where? You still haven't learned? You still haven't learned? - Islamic State! - The best! Ready? Fire! It is the road to paradise. But not for the infidels. - Islamic State! - For life! - Islamic State! - For life! - Islamic State! - For life! From a land with no mountains To the mazes of the sands You used to play with children And dream of being a hero A wind took away your dreams They were just an illusion Where did you go? And what did you find? Too long is your absence, oh Nassim Sweetheart, are you with me? How are you? You're going to be okay. What's your name? Where are you from? Belgium? France? Why did you come here? Where are we? Tell Abyad, near the Turkish border. Can I telephone someone? - Telephone who? - My mum. The YPG has to question you first. Please. Keep it short. And speak in Arabic. Nassim? What do you want from me? You're the one who sent him out there. You will help me get him back. Things like that cost money. A lot of money. - How much? - More than you have. How much? 20,000. 20,000. Fuck. You've never believed all the bullshit you say. - It's all about the money. - You can always find someone else. Yes. It's in the hands of Allah, Leila Go, and come safely back All I want is to save my sons Everyone wants, hopes To enter paradise I'm Belgian. - I need to go there, to Syria. - No, you can't. - Please. - No. You can't.

She came by quite often. - Laetitia! How are you? - Hi! - Where have you been? Are you well? - Yes, I am. I hardly recognized you with that new haircut. Your mum looks nice, eh? Please tell me. Hi there. It will soon be over. You'll see. Hey. Are you OK? Oh dear. What's wrong? Come here. What's the matter? You know you can talk to me. What's on your mind, Nassim? Tell me. Nassim?

Hit me, if you like We're just cattle anyway The stuff you put up your nose Is far worse than our weed Standing in line at the pharmacy Awaiting your dose for free You're just a gangster All high and mighty A few missiles more A few dollars more One thing's for sure You'll burn hardest of all Evil is behind your miscegenation Your true face is a revelation When you stare at our soldiers They want to know how many guys You've already slain Those you brought over And were never seen again Whose family'll have Nothing left of them at all From the start They lived in denial You talk to me about my way of life? Sure you don't mean your strife? At the hospital It's my wife doing the haute couture Doctor of collateral damage Of bad posture When I'm gone You will keep on Hearing these words over and over The identity crisis That forms your conversations' basis It's your fault our brothers leave Once converted I came here with a purpose Deserted all my friends Here they sniff lattes All is haram but the lotto For you, as far as I can tell Gambling with women is easy All for business Attracting recruits even from Brazil Your passport is taken You stay anxiously Until you believe in their fantasy The damage is done You won It hurts My kid brother had a joystick And now a gun.
