The President's arrived. Make sure all positions are secure. Kelsey, you're on point. Affirmative. Can't keep your eyes off me, huh? My wife might get jealous. Don't flatter yourself. I'm worried about you getting more attention than the President. Your fly's open. Wow, a sense of humor. When did you get that? Clear. We're all clear, Mr. President. Okay. Let's go. ...that due to unexpected changes in the President's schedule, each reporter will be limited to one question only at this press conference. Our focus today is to discuss the President's "Get Smart" school measure and to update you on his recent proposal... Positions. ...to increase funding for the International Emergency Response Unit program. Please... Stage right, check in. Stage right all clear. Stage left, check in. Stage left clear. Point all clear. Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. The President is now making his way into the auditorium. Emergency response team. Get the President to the motorcade! Go! Go! Go! Go! Motorcade, we have the President in tow and are under fire. Stand by! Over. Go! Clear! Red. Right. - Alpha clear. - Clear. - Bravo clear. - Clear. Green! Green! Delta, are we clear? Delta, acknowledge! You gotta be kidding me. Congratulations, Kelsey. You just got the President killed. Everyone, video viewing Monday morning, 08:00, at which point the advanced team will update each section on their detail responsibilities and contacts in Seattle. Have a nice weekend. Did you see it? I had no idea. God, it is so beautiful out here. Another margarita? Sure, why not? Oh, I'll make this round. Go relax. Any more relaxed and I'd be passed out. Thanks. The pleasure's all mine. You know, I was thinking, why don't you stay in Seattle another week? Maybe I'll introduce you to the President. Huh, thanks, but he's not the one I voted for. I think I'm gonna go for a swim. You gonna join me? Huh, no. I don't think so. Come on, Garrett. Come swimming with me. You gonna come swimming with me? Garrett, come on. Wow. That margarita has one hell of a punch. What'd you do? All done? All done. I'm not worried about it. You know, just last... Look at it as a new life, a new beginning. You're about to enter the dating world. A jungle where first impressions mean everything. Mmm. Why are... Why are you telling me this? Because your sense of style sucks. Oh, and you waited five years to tell me? Good friend. Well, it didn't matter before. You were married. Hey, Kelsey. Look, I... Quick question for ya. When you meet a guy, what do you first look for? Easy, shoes. They tell me everything I need to know. Shoes? Sure. Flashy shoes, he's a mirror boy. Checks himself out a lot. Self-absorbed. Italian leather, he's got money. Pointed shoes, you can't trust him. And if his shoes don't match what he's wearing, I don't even need to go there. Now, shoe size, I think we need to know each other better before we talk about that, because that could rule out all the above. Oh. I rest my case. The President has a Sky Tram dedication on Saturday, so I'd like you to call Agent Winslow in Seattle immediately and tell him exactly what you're telling me. Okay? Thanks. I'm gonna get Kelsey working on the tram perimeters. Is there anything else... I want you to handle that. Alex, I think Kelsey's got the potential to be one of the best agents in this department. And you're telling me this because? Well, Daley was afraid of you getting his job, which you did, for all the right reasons of course. I was just wondering if there's something about Kelsey you were afraid of? No. I still want you on it. All right, I'll do it. Just thought I'd ask. New toy? Yeah. These things are great. Now there's not a place in the world I can go where I can get away from fax or email. Hmm. Oh. Hey, Ryan. Could you give this to Dylan for me and tell him that I'm really sorry but I can't make his birthday party? Grant's coming in tomorrow. Well, he'll be here later. Why don't you give it to him? We're going to Playworld for pizza. You wanna come? Oh, gee, you know, I'd love to, but I can't. Come on, Alex. Remember how much fun we had last time? My point exactly. Excuse me. We got another one. Bye-bye. This is three in the last month? What was this one's route? Via an email address in Kentucky. The last was from Georgia. The one before that was Florida. This guy's bouncing emails all over the place. And he's getting closer. They're still working on tracking the source code. The FBI says they should have a profile on him in the next 48 hours. Agent McGregor, line two. Yep, McGregor here. You're kidding. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. That was the Field Office in Seattle. Garrett Winslow's dead. How? They think it was a boating accident. He'd been drinking, hit his head, fell overboard. Drowned. I can't believe it. Stewart McCall's taking over Winslow's position as Field Chief. You know McCall? I guess you could say that. Sure you're gonna be all right? Yeah. Yeah, I should call Patti. Who... Who's Patti? Garrett Winslow's sister. They were pretty close. I don't know what the hell you think you're doing, Mike. You can't keep catering to these special interest groups. Come on, you know how the game is supposed to be played. No, why don't you tell me? Because I'm at a complete loss as to what you're up to these days. Cut the pious act, Jonathan. I've been doing this a lot longer than you have. Look, you're the Vice-President. If and when you're President, can run the country as you see fit. Until then, it's my job. I'm not gonna waste any more time playing on opposite sides of the field with you. Do you understand me? Very clearly. The DRCs for the President and the Vice-President came in. Silver is for the President. Red is for the Vice-President. I can't understand all this new technology. I can barely work my palm computer. These are pretty easy, actually. You push one button and you have a direct secure line to any one of the same color phones. You can also program cellular numbers into here. You just hit this last button, and you scroll down to the number that you need. Okay, I'll take mine and the President's now. Why don't you send one to Jess and I'll ask him about the other one? The Vice-President will tell you who to send his to. Can I talk to you about something? Sure. We're gonna have to walk and talk though, 'cause I'm late. The assassination exercise on Friday. I was told we were just being timed to get to the motorcade. Well, maybe the person who told you that was a plant. There's no room for assumptions, Kelsey. As Point person, it's your responsibility to protect the President's ass, not worry about time. You should have gotten an all-clear sign on that motorcade before you opened that door instead of assuming that it was fine. I haven't done anything right in your eyes since I got on this detail. Why am I even here? Do you think I'm hard on you? Yeah, I do. Well, you made a mistake in a world where there's no room for them. Well, isn't that why we have training exercises in the first place, Agent McGregor? To learn from our mistakes? Kelsey, you, like everyone else on this team has to prove to me that you're everything I think you are. If that means coming down harder on you... ...I will. I don't intend to lose a President on my watch. We will talk about it later, I promise. I love you too, honey. Bye. That was Jess. She wanted me to thank you for that care package you sent her. What am I gonna do, Alex? She wants to get a tattoo. Deficits I can handle, but my little girl with a tattoo? I'm afraid you're a little late on that. Don't tell me. Thank you, Leslie. What's the tattoo of? I think I'll let her tell you that, sir. At least tell me where it is. I don't think you wanna go there, sir. What do you have? This is your DRC. Your Digital Relay Communicator. You just press one of these buttons, and it calls one of the other phones directly. I figured you'd want Jess to have one. Yes. Absolutely. Just let me know who you wanna give the other one to. This the only color they come in? The Vice-President was issued red ones. I'm sure we could arrange to have the red one... I'm kidding. Hello? Jess doesn't have anything other than her ears pierced, does she? Ryan, here's the disk. Ah, great. Did you... Did you get all the names? Yeah. They were on there. Daddy! Hey, champ! How are ya'? Good. Where's your mom? Waiting in the car with Gracie. She's asleep. Hey, Agent Dylan, I hear it's your birthday, and you know what, I got something for ya. Hey, how 'bout that? Huh, happy birthday! What, you're gonna give him your favorite police car, Sheldon. It's been on your desk for months. Come on, Alex's got something for you too. Just clean it up a little. It's great. Yeah? Hey, you got a visitor. Hey! How did you get in here? Oh! Saturday's my birthday, Alex. I'll be six. Six? I just happen to have something for a six-year-old. Hey. Wow, thanks! You hangin' in there? I'm sorry about Winslow. I was really looking forward to finally meeting him. Pokeman cards! Oh, thanks, Alex. Yeah. Grant's on line two. Oh, tell him to hold on one second. Happy Birthday, Dylan. Thanks, Alex. Come on, champ. Mom's waitin'. See you tomorrow. See you later. Grant, I was hoping you'd call. How was the river? Wet. I had six screaming kids all decide to paddle on the same side of the boat at the same time right before we hit Devil's swirl. So, I'm guessing you swirled? Yeah. I was hoping you'd call me this morning. I was very busy. I've been out. I've been out shopping all day. What, a white sale at Campers R' Us? You are so funny. No, I was just picking up a few last-minute things for our trip. We're gonna be at my dad's for one night. How much stuff could you possibly need? Mmm. Just the essentials. You sure you wanna come up for just one day? We could reschedule when we're less busy. No, Alex. No. I haven't seen you in three weeks. It's... It's been too long. It's just that I'm really swamped here. There's a lot going on. What else is new? I will see you tomorrow. Okay. Goodbye. See ya. Bye. Christina, another one? Mmm-hmm. Oh, it's your third one. Now, look, don't get any mustard on your dress, okay? Okay. Thanks, Grandpa. Thank you. Gentlemen. I didn't want it to come to this, but we have to protect our interests. The future. Excuse me. Yeah. Where's your sister? She's having a shower. I hope that's okay. Job well done. Come here. When you were on the boat with him... ...did he touch you? Like this? Tell me. Tell me. I only thought of you. You're not afraid of anything or anyone, are you? We're talkin' the President of the United States. That's the beauty of this country. When you're as rich as I am, you can get away with anything. Now, dry yourself off, come outside and have a hot dog. Never thought I'd see the day. I couldn't get a fishing pole in her hand as a kid to save my life. She looks very happy, Grant. Well, I know I am. Most women get chocolates and flowers. I get a fly rod and vest. You joining me? Yeah, in a minute. Clay... I want to marry Alex. You asking for my permission? Well, yeah, I'm... I'm sort of a traditional guy, and I was hoping that that would be okay with you. It couldn't be more okay. Alex. Hey. I decided to use a wet fly, 'cause the yellow humpers weren't working. Step aside, give the master some room. Where's your pole? It's back in the house. Not bad. Yeah, I had a good teacher. You know, Alex, you and I, we make a good pair. I... Gotcha! Yes! Ooh! Go! Don't just stand there, get the net! Get the net! Dad is not gonna believe it. Okay. Just bring him in. Oh, my! Look at the size of this guy! That is a massive trout. Dad! Okay. This is gonna be tougher than I thought. So, what's Grant up to? He's taking a shower. There you go. Thanks. Need some help with that? No, I'm just cooking this minnow as a little appetizer. Very funny. Minnow. It's a whale. You really love him, don't you? Yeah. I do. He makes me laugh. He's kind. In a lot of ways he reminds me of you. I can't explain. Honey, you don't have to. I can see it in your face. Oh, Dad. Alex. Yeah? Why bother making the bed? I have plans for messing it up. Grant, we can't sleep together. You know my dad's rules. He's old-fashioned, but only married couples can sleep together. Who said anything about sleeping? That tickles. Good night. No. I'm not letting you get away. Oh, really? Yeah. Good move. I had a good teacher. - Alex... - Alex. Dad? Come, uh... Sorry. No, that's okay. We were just makin' the bed. Just makin' the bed. Yeah, okay. Uh, I wanted to give you this quilt, but I see you found a comforter. Sorry for the intrusion. I'll see you kids in the morning. Yeah. Good night, Dad. Good night. Good night. I'm gonna turn in, too. Good night. We should get an early start in the morning, 'cause the President wants you to stop by the White House before I take you to the airport. To say hello. Sure. Great. Cheer up. I'll sneak in later. Hey. And I'll personally escort the President to the Sky Tram after the dedication. You going home after this is over? Why, is there something else you'd like us to do? Maybe. I like having you around. We have another job. Oh, yeah. Anyone I know? Perhaps. Show him, Evan. The beauty of this piece is that once you set your range, the bullet will explode whether you hit your target or not. The bullet's at a maximum velocity of 100 meters. The hit will take place at that range. Where'd you get that? I built it, through the Internet. It's amazing what you can do with the right dot-coms. Your brother's use of the information highway is very impressive. We all have our addictions. Don't we? Bye-bye. That's a Monet. 1963, the Kennedy family donated that to the White House as a tribute to Kennedy's love of the outdoors. So, did you ask her? No. After all the great advice I gave you you chickened out, didn't ya? It hasn't been the right time. First there was a fish, then there was her father, and I just... Look, I'm gonna try again when you guys return from the Middle Eastern Peace Summit. That's six weeks from now. No offense, but if you're busy, she's busy. Hmm. How's Jess? One semester of political science, she's already telling me how to run the country. Huh. Hasn't changed a bit. Good morning, sir. The FBI's profile says he's male, college education, probably Ph.D. level, and a personality that loves temptation. The advancing time on the President's watch in each of the earlier cartoons is obviously some kinda countdown. Now, whoever this guy is, he obviously wants to have some fun. Keep us guessing. Each image suggests some kind of betrayal. Like a knife in the back, you never see it coming. The cartoon presentation itself reflects the possibility that he views his life, or the President's, as a joke. Simple guy. Excuse me, Mr. President. Your appointment with the Ambassador. Thank you, Leslie. Mr. President, Grant and I need to be getting to the airport. He's got a plane to catch. It was good to see ya. It was good seeing you. Thank you for everything. Say hello to Jess for me. I will. You know, Alex, I just had a thought. After Seattle, instead of playing golf with Senator Burdge, I think I'd rather stick around and do a little fishing. Fishing? I didn't say anything. And I'd like Grant to come along and be my guide. Which means he'd have to come to Seattle with us. There's some good fishing on the straits up through Puget Sound there. What's your schedule? Do you think you could come along with us? Well... Sir, this is awfully short notice. You've had less. Come on, Grant, what do you say? Well, I'm supposed to be guiding a rafting trip on Friday, but... I bet I could get somebody else to cover for me. I'm not sure this is a good idea. I don't want it to interfere with the Seattle assignment. Lighten up. He's not coming for you. He's coming for me. Fishing. Hmm? Okay, hold it. Well, hey, handsome. Rachel, uh... How'd you get in here? I've got my ways. And where have you been? I tried calling you all weekend. I was just on a friend's boat. Sorry. Miss me? Yeah, I... I sort of thought we had something goin'. Well, we still do, don't we? Yeah, I... I have to get back to the Control Room, though. Well, how 'bout some company? You really wanna get me in trouble, don't you? Come on, you know what happens when you come in the booth with me. Yeah, I know exactly what happens. President Hayes arrived in Seattle today, to participate in the dedication of the new Sky Tram Cable System and Recreational Facilities at Mountaingate Park on Saturday. As expected, downtown traffic came to a standstill. Here they come. The President's in his suite. Why don't you check your shift rotations and have your reports ready. You guys have a little time to get settled, then I'm gonna meet you upstairs in operations. Okay. Agent McGregor? Brinkman. Welcome to Seattle. Thank you. Agents Nicholson, Bryant, Innes. And this is my, um... Mr. Coleman, the President's... Personal wardrobe coordinator. Nice to meet you. We have some updated intel for you. Our Field Operations Office is on the third floor. Agent McCall is waiting for you there. I'm sure he is. Excuse me a second. Let's go. Nice shoes. Could you do me a favor and take this up to the room for me? I need to head up to the Operations Office, and... Sure. This badge, it has to be facing out or somebody's gonna stop you. Okay. I'll see you later. He's over there. Agent McCall. Miss Alex McGregor. Or is it missus now? Hello, McCall. It's Miss, actually. Ah. So, I see you met Brinkman, my right-hand man. Yep. Anything you need. Thank you. Where's the rest of your team? They're getting settled. Well, you look beautiful, but then again, what else is new, right? Still a charmer, huh? I'm impressed. Head of Presidential detail. We had a pillow talk about that, didn't we? Really? I don't remember. Still chipping away at my ego, I can see. It would take a nuclear blast to chip away at your ego. I'm sorry to hear about Garrett Winslow. Hell of a way to get a promotion. He's gonna be missed around here. Why don't I introduce you around? Why don't you. Grant? They have got a Jacuzzi tub in here big enough for the two of us. This place is huge. It's bigger than my house. Yeah, well, a lot of tree houses are bigger than your house. If that's your dad, I'm gonna kill him. Wow. What is it? Thanks. It's for you. Really? It's from the President. Is there something going on between the two of you I should know about? Hmm, no. Mmm-mm. "Timing is only a restriction one places on oneself." What's that about? It's a guy thing. Don't worry. I'm gonna share it with you. I gotta take off for a scout. You gonna be okay? Yeah. I'm a big boy. I take care of myself. But maybe later we can have this in the tub together? Grant, I'm not on vacation here, okay. I'm working. I understand that. I was, just thinking... I know what you were thinking. You do? Tell me. 'Cause I like it when you tell me what I'm thinking. You were thinking get Alex in the tub, drink a little champagne, loosen her up... Was I that obvious? Yeah. Actually, it sounds pretty good. You just better not be asleep when I come back this time. Good God. Are you ready? Yeah. Oh... McCall, this is Grant Coleman. Hey. The famous river guide we've heard so much about. Hey, how you doin'? Okay, well. Could you excuse us for a second? Sure. Sure. Thanks. Sorry. I'll see you later. Okay, I'll take care... of the last-minute fishing details, okay. Oh, thanks. Hurry back. Yeah. Bye. I spoke to Patti. She wanted me to pick up some of his personal things and send them to her. The Coast Guard picked them up out of the water a couple of miles from his boat. Hey, here. Well, thank God it's moored. I turn green on these things. It's called "docked," Sheldon. Right. Hey, this is... This is nice. This was his life outside the Service. We used to come out on this boat a lot when I was at college with his sister, Patti. Oh, yeah? He talked about the Secret Service so much, I ended up joining. So, what are we packing? Just the personal stuff for now. The President will enter stage right to give his speech. How many exits are there? Eight. Make sure all primary and alternate exit routes are cleared and secured. ...alternate exit routes are cleared and secured. Alex, I know. What happened to us? You were cheating on me. Remember? Yeah. That's why you declined my request for Presidential detail. I needed people around me I could trust. Ouch. Alex, you know that was always my dream. Well, you did it to yourself. In my book, character counts. Why'd you quit working for the Vice-President anyway? Because he wasn't the President. So, your Grant and the President become buddy-buddy after he saves his daughter. Is that right? They actually have a lot in common. You know, I never pictured you falling for the outdoors type. You always preferred the indoors with me. Well, some people change. You and mountain man serious? I can't see how that's any of your business. I just thought that because you brought the guy along with you. I didn't. Okay. The President invited him. So you guys aren't serious? Why are you so interested in my love life? So, you're in love. Marriage material? You know, I would really like to check out this Sky Tram and finish this scout, if you don't mind. Look, I've made arrangements to go over there this afternoon, after I take you out for lunch of course. I've got a debriefing with the President this afternoon. I'll treat you to a hot dog at the tram. Get in. Your dog. Mustard, no ketchup. You remembered. Sorry to disappoint you. They were out of ketchup. That tree cover up there makes me nervous. Don't be. We're gonna have the entire mountain shut down and only invited guests. Sheriff's Department will secure the perimeter after today's sweep and my guys will do a final walk through an hour before the President arrives. The tram people are aware the President's not gonna ride to the top? Just the dedication and we're out? Yes. The tram will be shut down. Okay. You've done a nice job with all this. Thank you. That means a lot coming from you. Oh, excuse me. Sorry. You haven't changed one bit. Kelsey, this guest list needs to be circulated for the banquet tonight. Make sure local PD has a copy. Okay. Anything else? Yeah. Anyone tell you I flunked the point test twice? No. Really? Oh, yeah. First time I had a break in contact. I turned around and the President wasn't behind me. So there I was, running away, all by myself. Second time, there was an initiation of fire, and instead of taking the President down, I ended up body-slamming him. The point is, I'm still here, and you'll make it, too. There's always gonna be something in that test. It's designed that way. So hopefully it doesn't happen out here. Thanks, Ryan. Has anyone ever passed the test their first time? Yeah. One. Alex. All right. McCall, this is Agents Innes, Nicholson and Bryant. Hello. Agent Innes is the newest member on our Presidential Detail. Oh, so you're the lucky one that got my spot, huh? Excuse me? Never mind. We ready for the banquet tonight? All set. I cannot stand in support of unilateral economic sanctions against them because they are being proposed not for... You mind me asking you where you bought your shoes? ...for domestic political gains. Nordstroms. They were having a sale. Today, implement program, that 20 years ago would be unattainable... Hey, you know how much longer they're gonna be? Not long. Oh, good. Thanks. It's, um, McCall, right? Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Hey, that's a nice watch. What is that, a Tag? A watch connoisseur amongst your many talents, is it? No, I just always wanted one. I guess river guiding probably wouldn't pay that much, would it? No, no. But it's not just a job, it's a... It's an adventure. The best part about it is I don't... I don't have to wear one of these suits. Did Alex ever mention to you the wonderful times that we spent together? No. No, she never mentioned it. Just two minutes, everybody. Grant, just the man I was looking for. The President would like you to come upstairs to discuss your fishing trip. Okay. I'll let him know. Mr. Hunter is on his way up. We should get going, Grant. I know a great restaurant you and Grant should go to for dinner. Sir, I've got a lot of work to do. Take one of the limos. Thank you so much, but we can't. I am giving you a full Presidential pardon for dinner to go out with Grant. You gotta eat sometime. He's right. All right. We'll grab a bite. Hello? Hi, Jess. Yes, these phones are very cool, but I'm sure not as cool as your tattoo. Hold on a sec. I'll let her sweat. Will you two go already. Thank you so much. Good luck. Okay, Jess, let's talk about the difference between wanting to have a tattoo and actually already having one. Alex, how are ya? Mr. Hunter. Now, how many times have I told ya call me JP. JP, I'm sorry. This is Grant. Coleman. Yeah. Hi! Nice to meet you. How do you... You know me? Jonathan told me all about you. We're very grateful for your involvement in getting Jessica back. Oh, well, she's a great kid. Mmm. Well, good to see you again. Nice to have met you. Nice meeting you. This way, Mr. Hunter. Bye-bye. Hey, JP. Jonathan. Your generosity with this tram dedication is really overwhelming. The pleasure is all mine. I know I haven't been showing it very much, but I'm really glad that you came. So, you actually went out with this McCall guy? We're all entitled to one mistake in our lifetimes, right? So, what'd you see in him? Exactly. More like, what didn't I see? What should we toast to? Us. To us. No foam, low-fat latte. Thank you. You're welcome. In Seattle, coffee comes out of the taps. Have Alex take a look at these spotter team locations for the parade. She's gonna need to sign off on them. All right. You call me on my cell if you need anything. Okay. Good night. Good night, boss. Good night. I've just been cross-checking the VIP list for the parade and dedication ceremonies, and it all looks good to me. Good. Aren't you off duty? Go on, get outta here. I will. I was just finishing up some work with Josh here. Oh, yeah. Mr. Shoes. What is it with my shoes? Nothing, nothing. It's just that they're very nice. That's all. Are you calling it a night? Not yet. I've gotta pack up Garrett's stuff and ship it back to his sister. Hey, guys. That was the FBI. We got a break on our hacker. They broke one of his tracing codes and followed it to a chat room. But get this, it's called "Predators." They got a partial location trace before he went offline. Partial to where? Right here in Seattle. Anyhow, if he goes back online again, we may get lucky. I'm not saying that. You're a good president, Jonathan. But, quite frankly, you're beginning to antagonize the wrong people. Now, I understand you have to make certain promises to get re-elected, but those promises are starting to cost some people financially. Including you, I'm sure. Look, I am here as a friend to tell you... No, to implore you to quit butting heads with the people who backed your campaign. You're beginning to sound like the Vice-President. Look, I made no promises to anyone who backed me, other than to do what I believe is right for this country. Now, did you come here to discuss politics or to have a long overdue dinner with a friend? A bit of both, I guess. Hello? Patti, it's Ryan. Oh, hi. I got Garrett's stuff together here. Oh, thank you. Thank you for doing that. You're welcome. Listen, I'm just curious. Was he dating anyone that you know of? You know Garrett, he always had someone. Why? Because I found a picture he took of a blonde woman on his boat. It was taken the same day that he died. Can I email it to you? See if you recognize her. Sure. Do you like it when he touches you? You know me better than that. That's why I'm asking. Evan, it's all about seduction. Sensuality is a weapon. You need to embrace that. You never know when it can prove useful. Do you understand? It's open. Come in. Ryan, we just got a call. The hacker went back online. We got an address. Let's move. Open your mouth, please. They're edamame, that's what they're called, but they're actually steamed. Edam... edamame? Edamame. Oh, thank you. What? You don't like it? No, go ahead. I just... I like my food cooked. That's what I love about you. You're so honest. Here, have some sake. You'll like that. Al... Yeah, what's up, Kelsey? Of course. I'm on my way. Get a hold of McCall. What... What are you doing? I gotta go. You have to go? Yeah, I'm sorry. Alex, what are you... What are you afraid of? What are... Are you afraid to be alone with me? Or are you afraid of someone else doing their job without you breathing down their neck? I wish I had time to stay and figure out what you meant by that, but I don't. I'm sorry. Can you catch a cab back to the hotel? We're in. Welcome to Sky Tram. Okay. Here she is. House is up there. He's still online. Alex, something's bothering me. There was a woman on Garrett's boat the day he died. How do you know? He had a camera. And there was a picture taken that day. I thought there were no other bodies found. There weren't. So, who is she? I don't know, but I downloaded the picture. You can see it when we get back. What if Winslow's death wasn't an accident? SWAT team's ready. Okay. Let's go. I've got the back. Hey, stop! Suspect's gone into the woods! Hey! Okay, stop right there! That's enough! Put your hands on your head! On your head! Now, turn around! Now get down, on your knees. On your knees! He's the murderer, man. He deserves to die. Forget it. He killed my brother, man. You'll get a chance to talk. He killed my brother. Ryan. Brinkman. All right, I got him. Go ahead. Cuff him. Wait! Wait a minute. Shut up. Over here. Ryan. I was too late. No. He's alive. Yeah, feel that. He's alive. Yeah. He's okay. I'm gonna keep pressure on him. We got a bleeder. - Go, go, go, go! - Out of the way! It's all right, Ryan. You're gonna be all right. Clear the way. Clear the way, please. Hang in there, buddy. Be strong, Ryan. You can fight it. What? I'm gonna ride with him. Look at these three control panels. Which one does Sky Tram use? The one in the middle. Are you sure? I'm sure. All right. So, what else did you learn from your tram friend? No, no. Keep working. I don't want any glitches. Tomorrow is our day. His name was Karl Whitford. He was 32 years old, lived alone. Worked as a research analyst specializing in the Internet. He had a Ph.D., and his brother was in the Marines. Rank of Sergeant. Served in Desert Storm. The President was his battalion commander at the time. He believed that his brother contracted Gulf War Syndrome and then died. He blamed the President because of it. What's on your mind? I just keep thinking about what Ryan said. I need to see that picture. I'm going up to Ryan's room. Have this photo circulated immediately. I wanna know who this woman is. You think she had something to do with Winslow's death? I just want to make sure she didn't. I'll get it over to Seattle PD and find out if any missing persons are a match. Get it to the FBI and see what they can find out as well. Ryan didn't make it. Katie, you love me. I want you to... I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me! I want you to say it to me. Stay away from me! Hey, Alex. I thought you'd be asleep by now. I'm sorry about earlier. I just... I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't be here. I guess I got caught up in the idea of us spending more time together, and I realize that that's probably never gonna happen. I'm just gettin' in the way, and I left a message for the President, and told him forget about the fishing. Honey? Yeah. What's wrong? Ryan's dead. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Are you gonna be okay? Mmm-hmm. I don't want you to go anywhere. Will you stay with me? Yes. Of course. Thank you. Oh, as usual... ...it must be unanimous. Gentlemen, we go as scheduled. Yeah, that sounds good. Just make sure everybody knows that it's moved. Thank you. Bye. Here, I thought you could use this. I just bumped the tram dedication up to noon just to change the schedule, and I rearranged the motorcade positioning in the parade. Good idea. Anything on our brunette? FBI came back negative. So did Seattle PD. Something up? You were right about me being harder on you than the rest. We live in a world where people see us as women first and agents second. I'm trying to change that. If that means that I have to be tougher on you, then I'm afraid that's what we're gonna have to do. I understand. I'd like to change that, too. Good. Thanks. Hi, Kelsey. Hi. You look like you didn't get much sleep either. Couldn't. I still can't believe it. Listen, I... I thought you might like to do the site prelim for the Sky Tram yourself. I'll ride with the President in the motorcade if you want. No, I think that's an excellent idea. Brinkman and McCall are clearing the route as we speak. Great. Well, I'm gonna head on over there. You don't think it's over, do you? No. I don't. What time does the President get here? In about an hour. And about how long's the dedication? An hour, maybe longer. Why? That should give me enough time to hike to that top and back. All the way up there and back? Sure, there's a fire trail that goes right up to the lodge. You don't think I can do it, do ya? You just want me to challenge you so you will. You know what, you better go off to work. I'm gonna bring you back a souvenir to prove it. It's closed today. I'll find something. Hey, call me later if you get off early. Okay. Oh. Alex, ETA for the motorcade is about four minutes. Roger that. Let's have the President go directly to the podium. If he wants to work the ropes, we can do it after the dedication. He says he's fine with that. Good. Alex, Operations put a call through to me. It's Winslow's sister. She wants to talk to Ryan. Thanks. Patti, hi. It's Alex McGregor. Special Agent in charge on Presidential Detail. I work with Ryan. Well, can you just tell Ryan for me that I have no idea who the blonde is in the picture he emailed me. He'll know what I'm talking about. Blonde? I thought it was a brunette. Well, he sent me a picture of a blonde woman. Listen, I gotta go. Patti, could you do me a favor? Could you email me that picture back, please? Well, I'm not gonna be home for about half an hour. Why don't you just get it from Ryan? I'm sorry to have to tell you this... Ryan was killed in the line of duty last night. I'm in. Good. This tram, which has been in operation for the past 30 years, will be retired to the Museum of Transportation and replaced by a whole new state-of-the-art cable system. And, thanks to Mr. Hunter's generosity, we will have a year-round recreational facility, where low-income families will have a place to go. The great thing about it is that many more people will be able to take advantage of these beautiful mountains. So with the implementation of this new program, Mountain Gate, I accept this wonderful bestowment from Mr. Hunter, and the dedication of the Sky Tram in my name. I am truly honored. Mr. President, we'll head this way to the dedication. Alex, we're taking the President to the tram for the signing. Copy. Wonderful speech, Jonathan. Thank you. Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Mountaingate Park, we would like to inform you... Not coming in? No, Mr. President. This is your moment. Mr. President. Shall we? Oh, this is great. I used to go up skiing in this as a kid. McCall, abort the signing. Get the President out of here right now. We may have a hitter. She's blonde, mid 20s, medium build. Keep your eyes peeled. Mr. President, over here. McCall, get the President out now. - Do you copy? - Copy. Close them. Now. Open these doors! I can't control it. Stand back! Hold on! Hold on. I can't. You can do it! Sir, this way. This way, sir. I can't breathe. I can't... It's all right. It's all right. I'm sure they're gonna figure it out. Please move to the exits immediately. I repeat. Get the Viper teams moving to the towers ASAP. Also alert the EMS, I want some eyes scanning those ridges. What's going on? I don't know. Alex, the operator can't stop it. Someone else is controlling it. McCall's getting a chopper up here. No, we don't have time for a chopper. There's gotta be a way to stop it! We can't! It's all computerized. Damn it! Get to the top, Kelsey. Lock down the area. What's going on, Alex? I'm not sure, sir. I need you down on the floor. Everybody should be. Now, please. As a precaution, they'd like us all to get to the floor. Get down. Let's go. Hey, you wondering if I'm there yet? Grant, where are you? I'm almost to the top. I bet you didn't think I could... We're in trouble, Grant. Listen, the President is trapped in the tram, okay. It's on its way up the mountain to who knows what. I'm on my way, but it's gonna be there before I am. Now, I need you to be my eyes. You've got to get to the top. There might be a woman up there. She's blonde. There might be others. Okay, please hurry. Got it. - It's gonna be okay. - It's gonna be okay. Alex, we're behind you, do you copy? Alex, do you copy? She's not answering. Yeah. You got a shooter on the roof. It's your blonde. You're gonna have to do something, Grant. The tram's almost there. Stay calm. Oh! Keep your head down. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Head down. Stay down. Are you all right, Mr. President? Yes. Stand back, sir. We'll get you outta here, sir. What about the rest of them? I'm afraid it's you they're after. Kelsey, I've got the President. Where are you? Almost there. Copy. There's another shooter around here someplace, and we're too exposed going back around, so I'm gonna have to take him through the lodge. Okay, you're gonna have to stay down, sir. Follow me. Damn! Stay down. Brinkman. I'm out. Okay. Stay down. Alex? Yeah? Is the President with you? Yeah, Brinkman. He's with me, but I've been shot. I can't move. There's another shooter on the roof somewhere. You've gotta get the President to the car. She's hurt pretty bad. Are you all right, sir? Yes. Kelsey. Just covering the President. Alex, we'll get him outta here. Step away from the President, McCall. Alex? Don't make me shoot you. I will. What's going on with you, Alex? You were the only one who knew that I would recognize her as the one we bumped into from the scout. So you changed that picture, right? You were in Ryan's room. Afraid I'd cancel the dedication? Step away from the President. You're losing it, Alex, aren't ya? Am I? Winslow's death wasn't just a boating accident. It was the only way to put you in charge, and Brinkman was your little helper. What was in it for you, McCall? We already talked about that, Alex. Let's get out of here. You're gonna be okay, Kelsey. I'm proud of you. Thanks. Wait a minute. Alex? What's wrong? This red DRC was in McCall's pocket. So? The red phone is a private direct line to the Vice-President. Why did McCall have it? All right. I want you to say two words. Yes? It's over. Now it's our turn, McCall. Let's go. The FBI's on their way to the White House right now. What if it doesn't end there? Hey. You okay? Yeah. You wanna get married? What's so funny? Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Wait, wait. I've been carrying this around all week. Grant! Don't cry. We have a special news bulletin. We just received word that moments ago, Vice-President Michael Warner was arrested on conspiracy charges to assassinate the President. His involvement in the attack in Seattle was uncovered by Secret Service Agent Alex McGregor, head of the President's Protection Detail. There has been no official statement yet from President Hayes, but a source close to him at the White House called this a dark day in American history.
