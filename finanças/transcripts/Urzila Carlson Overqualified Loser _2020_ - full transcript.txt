Make some noise, welcome to the stage... Urzila Carlson! You guys! See? This is why... This is why people love Australia. 'Cause you guys are just off the fucking nut. Just quickly, before we start... I just-- I feel like I want to share something with you. 'Cause sometimes, right, audiences will send me gifts. Like, not this audience. Honestly, sometimes audiences bring me gifts, and then they give it to the usher and the usher will bring it backstage and then I have to open it. Because I don't have a crew of people that travel with me 'cause I'm not Adele. You know, I don't know how people imagine, like... I walked here tonight. The five blocks. You know when you make that decision, you go, "It's only five blocks, I'm gonna walk it"? And then after the third block, you go, "Fuck, I should've taken an Uber." Then you go, "It's too late now, I can't get an Uber now for two blocks, 'cause they'll think I'm lazy." You don't want them to give you a two-star 'cause you're lazy 'cause then you have to fake a limp and stuff. "Yeah, I just sprained my ankle." So I get this gift, right? I do a show in Auckland, and a woman sends a gift with an usher, and the usher brings it to the room. And now I'm gonna open it, but it looked dodgy as hell. It was just wrapped in brown paper. And-- And it had a string around it, and not that fancy string that you get now over Christmas. You know, you always get-- Like your sister-in-law, she'll be doing all this fancy fucking wrapping and shit. And you go, "Okay, calm down. We know it's bath salts." It's like, "Christ, you just spent $45 on the wrapping of a $2 fucking gift. And we don't have a bath!" Not one of those strings, it was just an old shoelace. So you know it's dodgy when the usher sort of kicks the door open, throws the gift and goes, "That came for you," and runs away. So I look at this gift and I shook it and no powder fell out of it and it wasn't ticking. I'm gonna open it. So I open the gift. And someone had sent me a moon cup. Like, a new one, but a moon cup. Now, for those of you who don't know what a moon cup is, ladies, if I can ask you to just turn to the men in your area... ...and just explain to them what a moon cup is so I don't have to. Talk amongst yourselves. If you don't know, ask the people behind you. They know. Oh, I don't know what's going on there. There's a lady in the back doing that... I don't know what you're explaining... ....but I think you're doing it wrong. For those of you who don't know what a moon cup is, it's basically a Tupperware bowl for your coochacha. Like, you whip it out when Aunt Flo comes to visit. You feel? But I knew. As soon as I received this gift, I knew I was in deep trouble 'cause I've got an inquiring mind... ...and I knew I was going to try it. Now, I'm not going to go into detail, but let me just tell you, it's not for me. Let's just say... Okay, you know when you're unpacking the dishwasher, right? Ladies, if you want to turn to the men in your area and just explain what I mean. No, you know when you're unpacking the dishwasher and you get to the kids' plastic bowls and cups and you don't take the time to individually dry each and every cup? You just kind of grab them, whack them and stack them away and then tomorrow morning, you have to feed those same children out of those bowls and you take it out and you're like... Yeah, that. So, no, it's not for me. I travel a lot. I'm on the road about 300 days of the year, and whenever I do go back home to Auckland, I always go see my GP and get them to do the once-over. Right, give it everything. Like, from head to toe, from head lice to ingrown toenails and everything in between. They check the boobs, the smear. They even give you the flu jab, you know, 'cause science. Um... I'm not going to tell you what to do with your life, you know, I'm just saying. We vaccinate 'cause we understand words and shit. Now, I understand that there might be some anti-vaxxers here tonight. 'Cause when I did the show in Auckland, 13 people got up and walked out... ...and the whole auditorium went... Like I was supposed to fight them or something. I'm like, "Leave them alone, they've got sick kids at home." So, anyway, I go in, I see my doctor. She does what she can do and then she sends me off to the nurse. Now, our nurse, Nurse Barb, retired two years ago. Which is a good thing because she was, like, two years younger than Jesus, okay? I'm not ageist. But the last two years, I also got a prostate check. I didn't hate it. That's why I went back the second year. Anyway, I walk in, we've got a brand new nurse, Nurse Maniah, and, uh, I look at her and I go, "Hi," and she's lovely, she's a lady in her fifties. Um... And I look around and I'm trying to find the gown. Because you have to put this gown on with an opening in the front because they're going to be working on your entertainment area... ...right? Now, personally... I'm not a big fan of the gowns because they never close properly. You know, 'cause I've had a few big Christmases in my time. Like, I don't identify as fat. But I've definitely, you know... I'm-- I'm quite a few meals ahead and a few shits behind, so... And, you know, you don't need to be a personal trainer... to know that if those two things don't line up, you can never be your goal weight. But I don't see the gown, and Nurse Maniah goes, "No, no, I use a lavalava." And I thought, "This is great, it's basically like a sarong. Not only do I get a smear but I also get a cultural experience. I love it." So I take the lavalava off her, and now I wait for her to leave and close the curtain so I can, you know, take my kit off and put it on. So she closes the curtain. But she stays in there with me. So at this point... I decide to decline the lavalava. She then takes it and biffs it on the desk, and I take my kit off and I hop on the table. Now, the protocol when going for a smear is you, the patient, must stare at the wall. And her, the nurse, must stare at a speck on the curtain over here. But never... do you make eye contact. So, she starts, and I can feel her rummaging around. Which is not what you want to feel at a doctor's surgery, you want a... you want a confident hand. You want-- You want someone that knows what's going on. And I could feel her rummaging around, and I don't know at what point... do I act? At what point should I go, "Do you need help?" Too awkward, right? Or do I just keep quiet and guide her hand in? Yeah, you're right, that would be too much. I didn't have to do either of those things because she asked me something that was so left field that it knocked me, I had to think about it for a second. She goes, "You still a virgin?" And I went... "Say what, now?" I was like, "Oh... Oh, no. I've had the sex heaps." And she goes, "Huh. Okay." She then leaves the room. At this point... I'm regretting not taking that lavalava. 'Cause now I'm just lying on that bed like a frozen supermarket chicken... ...worried that someone might come in. They didn't. She came back in a flash. She had a smaller speculum. And she was at it again and she goes, "I'm just gonna ask you again." She goes, "You sure you've had sex before?" I go, "Yeah!" I said, "I'm married, my wife's waiting in the waiting room." She goes, "Oh... ...I see." She goes... "But have you had sex with a man?" I said, "Yes, I'm familiar with disappointment." She says, "I'm just asking 'cause you've got the smallest vagina I've ever worked with in my career." I went, "No shit!" I guided her hand in, she took the swab. I got dressed, I went in the waiting room and I go, "Come, babe!" To my wife, not to a stranger. I go, "Come." We walk back in. I said, "Nurse Maniah's got something to tell you about my... ...entertainment area." Nurse Maniah looks at her, she goes, "If I had to describe her vagina with one word, I'd say... petite." My wife immediately turns to me and she goes, "You cannot use this story on stage." I said, "Bitch... ...a medical professional just told me something on me is petite. I'm fucking telling everyone!" But that explains the moon cup, doesn't it? I needed a thimble. So this show is called Loser and I decided to write the show 'cause I was so... confused, like it's always negative if you lose anything. You lose your keys, you lose your mind, you lose your dad: that's negative. But you lose a bit of weight: positive. And I don't understand that. Like, if you lose half a kilo, strangers will applaud that. You can go out right now and go, "I lost half a kilo," people will go, "Good on you," and give you a high five. Which I don't understand. If you truly love someone-- If you love someone, don't you go, "I fucking love you so much, I wish there were 50 kilos more of you"? With everything else, if you love it, you want more. You love cake? Fucking give me more cake. Or you love money? Give me more money. I fucking love you? Less of that. It makes no sense. Now, I know... I know I need to lose some weight. I know that. But I-- I want to be very careful. I just want to lose enough weight so I can eat in public. I just want to be able to eat a pie in public. 'Cause you know if you're in here and you're a bit of a chub, you know you cannot eat in public. You will be judged, right? Like-- Even if it's a celebratory pie. Even-- Even if your stomach stapling has been really successful... ...and to celebrate, you go to BP to get a pie 'cause they've got the best pies. That's what their name is for. You go over there, you grab a pie and you're outside eating that pie, like, "Nom-nom, 80 kilos gone." You know some fuckwit in a ute will drive past and go, "Who ate all the pies?" And you have to go... "I did." So I know I have to lose some weight. But I want to be careful 'cause I don't want to lose too much and end up in porn. 'Cause you know that is a very real possibility. If you're hot. If you're super... Like you are, you're proper hot. Right? Like, you're a beautiful couple. Do you work out together? - Yeah. - Of course you do. I'm not fit-shaming you. But you're a hot couple. Like, aesthetically, you're quite pleasing to the eye. Like, if you two came up to me in a bar and asked me for a threesome, I'd be in. Yeah. And not just in a "hold the camera" kind of way. I'd give it my all. I would get so freaky, you two would be super impressed. Like, halfway through, over my naked butt, you'd just be high fiving each other, going... "Fucking score on this one, eh?" But you have to be careful. 'Cause you're beautiful, you could end up in porn. The rest of you, you're fine. 'Cause, you know, if you're in a happy, healthy relationship and you've got a healthy sex life, at some point, one of you will turn to the other and go, "We should record ourselves. You know, while we're... You know?" And you will. If you're going, "We'll never do that," your partner's probably already doing it. You may as well get involved. There's a whole genre of porn of you not being in porn. So you might as well. And then you're going to go, "Okay, fine." Then you've got to take your smartphone, you'll prop it up somewhere in the room. And then you go at it. You go at it hammer and tongs, right? You give it your A-game 'cause you know you're recording yourself. Then afterwards you go, "Okay, go get it." He rolls off you, he goes and he gets it. He comes back and you're excited. You're like... "Oh, this is going to be good. This is going to be great, yeah. I love you." And you hit play. "Why is my arsehole so dark? Why is it so hairy? It looks like a tarantula is crawling out of a cave." You look at your body at an angle you wouldn't normally see, performing an activity you wouldn't normally see reflect back in a shopfront window. You see things on your body that you wouldn't normally see. You look at that and you go... "Is that a nipple on my back?" And your partner's, like, super blasé He goes, "Yeah. I thought you knew." You're like, "No, every time it's cold, I think it's the fucking label on my cardigan!" And he's like, "No, no. And when it's really hot, it does that weird Barbie mouth thing, that..." You look at that footage, it's not natural. It's your fat, pasty-ass white body plowing at pace... ...into another fat, pasty-ass white body... meeting abruptly in the middle. It doesn't even sound good. Like, in the heat of the moment, you don't hear anything. But when it's silent and you're just staring at your white body with an extra nipple on a little screen, all you can hear... Like, "What is that noise? Oh, it's your balls on my tummy." You look at that and you go, "Why am I fucking you? Why are you fucking me? Let's never do this shit again." Then you go, "Delete it." And he goes, "I will." "No, you're fucking doing it now!" He deletes it. You double-check it's deleted out of the recently deleted. That couple then take that phone together, walk it out to the shed, take a hammer... ...smash it till there's only powder left, take a brush, into a little plastic bag. You drive from the top of the country to the bottom of the country and at every public toilet, you stop and you put some of that dust in the toilet... and then you flush it just in case some IT genius is about to crawl out of his mother... to put that shit back together again and share it with the world. We are very careful. But you two... Not you two. You're like, "Yeah, let's record ourselves." "Yes, let's. Let's. Just let me finish moisturizing." And then you prop the phone up, and afterwards you go, "Go get it," and he's like, "Yeah, no worries." Don't even need to get out of the bed 'cause that yoga is finally paying off. Actually, that hurt my back. I don't think I... Medic! You take that phone. Like, "Let's have a look at this. Oh, this is gonna be good. I love me." You hit play on that. You're like, "Oh... Oh, yeah, look at that! Look at that!" Like, "Holy shit. I'm glad we went for that two-for-one anal bleaching. We look amazing! We should get a blue light, let it light up." "This is phenomenal work. Yeah, wait, wait, my best part's coming up. The dismount. You go into a full triple back flip..." I'm not very good at sports talk, you know. "Full splits onto my dick. This is lovely." You go... You go, "Save that. Save that. We look phenomenal." You go, "Let's watch it tomorrow when we get back from pilates." Tomorrow night, you get back from pilates. You're like... "Oh, yeah. You know how I get all limber and into it. Now, let's watch it." So you watch it again. You go, "Fuck, we are beautiful. We'll save it. We'll watch it tomorrow night after my spinning class. You know how I get after spinning class. When my perineum is still vibrating." I assume that's what happens, I don't know. I don't ride a bike. I'm an adult, I've got a car. And then you watch it again and you go, "You know, we are so beautiful. It'll be a waste if only we get to see it. We should upload it." Then you load it up to Pornhub and we're now all whacking off to you two... ...'cause we're no longer fucking each other. So all I'm saying is get ugly or get fat, or you're going to be in porn.; You know your dad's going to find it. Yeah. Your mum won't know what's going on. You know... You have not lived as an adult if you haven't been at your parents' house on a Sunday waiting for the roast, your mum's in the kitchen you're watching some trash with your dad, and then your mum just pops out of the kitchen going, "Hey! Can you have a look at the computer? It's wiped the history again." And you look at your dad and you go, "Motherfucker! Can't remember your Facebook login but know how to wipe the history, do ya?" And your dad's like, "Oh, it's all right, I'll have a look later." I bet you fucking will. So anyway, what I'm saying is I need to lose some weight. I'm already panicked. Because I'm of the size, whenever they talk on the news about the obesity epidemic in Australia, I know I could be one of those arses walking in the street. You know the one. When as soon as they start talking, they go, "We've got a dietician here. Um... The obesity epidemic in Australia..." And you're like, "Oh, no. No, no, no. Where did they film today?" And when you... When you see they're in an area where you were, you're like... "No! Oh, fuck off!" 'Cause, you know, it's always you in your track pants. I see those fat people walk with these short steps like this. I'm like, "What the fuck are you doing? Stride it out, motherfucker!" Have you guys ever watched that show The Biggest Loser? Yes. You know when they came up with the concept for that show, there wasn't a fat person in a ten-kilometer radius. Because it would've been a completely different show. When they came up with the concept, they were all sitting in a boardroom in their yoga pants, and they go, "All right, we've got $200 million. What are we doing?" And Karen in Marketing went, "Well... how about we take 12 fat people... ...and we put them in this fat farm scenario, and then we give them, like, six carrot sticks a day to eat... ...and we give them these really angry personal trainers." Like you get them any other way. "We give them these really angry personal trainers to yell at them all day and make them exercise and then vomit up those carrot sticks." And everyone's like, "All right. All right." Even if there was a fatty in the room at this point, they'll go, "Harsh. But watchable." You've watched it. And then they go, "Okay, Karen, then what?" "Well, then we just monitor their progress. So once a week, we just put them on some scales in their cute little outfits. And then behind them, in giant red LED lights that they can't see, we put the weight they used to be, their weight now, their BMI, and their sperm count. And then we judge them like that." Now, if there was a fatty in the room, they'd go, "Hang the fuck on," at this point. They'd go, "Just a minute, just a fucking minute. What are these cute little outfits you're talking about?" She goes, "Oh. I thought, like, bike pants and sports bra?" "No." 'Cause you know what, if you're over the age of two... ...you don't look cute or good in 'em. The only people allowed to wear bike pants and a sports bra are people under the age of two or if you're in the Olympics. That's it. Tomorrow morning, if you wake up and you're putting those bike pants on, go, "Am I over the age of two?" If the answer is yes, then ask yourself, "Am I in the Olympics?" If the answer is no, get the fuck out of those pants. 'Cause you know what the problem is with that outfit, especially for women of a certain age. Like, I'm in my mid-forties. You know what the hardest thing of my day is? Lining up my nipples. I wake up every morning and when I put a bra on, it's like doing two really complex Rubik's cubes. Oh, fuck it. Tuck it into your pants. Well, Karen, you can't tuck it into your pants when you're not fucking having anything in the middle. It'll look like a fleshy scarf. Fat people don't like to get weighed. That's why we don't skydive. Well, that, and it scares the shit out of whoever has to do a tandem jump with you. But... When you skydive, they weigh you. And then they write your weight on your hand with a permanent marker. I don't want to be telling people three days after my jump, "Oh. Oh, no, it's not a phone number." If I was in charge of making The Biggest Loser, it would look completely different. For starters, the people I would put in there. I'd put people in The Biggest Loser, those people who never say thank you for shit. Like when you're driving and you give someone a gap and usually it takes a few goes to try and get them in the hole. You're like... And then they take it... and you wait for it. But they just keep going. It's like they take that gap and go, "Mine!" What kind of animal raised you... ...that you would take a gap and not just put your hand up like that to thank the person behind you? That's all you have to do. 'Cause if you don't thank the person behind you, you're making it unsafe on our roads. 'Cause now I have to aggressively overtake you... ...to go get my good deed back 'cause you were raised by an animal. It's the same as when you're driving and there's a pedestrian crossing and you stop and a car there stops, and then the pedestrian walks past and they thank this guy and just walk past your car, and you're like... "What's going on here? I'm doing what they're doing. Where's my thank you?" I reckon if they're two thirds past your car and they haven't started lifting their arm, hit them with your car. Not to kill 'em. Just to knock 'em down so you can talk to 'em. Then you hop out of your car and go, "Don't worry, I've got this. I'm a medical professional. I've got a petite vagina." You go, "Where's my thank you, asshole?" Those people are all going on my Biggest Loser campl Or when you're at work, right, and you're in the lunchroom, you just want to eat your sandwich in peace. And then you hear it... And you look over and there he is. You go, "Jesus, Brian. How about you just leave that cup of tea for a minute? That's going to cool down to a temperature... where you can just go ahead and drink it. Where it won't sound like you lost your top lip in a violent accident. And now you're curving your bottom lip in a straw-like scenario, trying to suck a teabag out of the bottom of that cup." Brian's going in The Biggest Loser camp. Or that friend that we all have that have never let you finish a sentence. You've been friends for years and this is the only thing they've ever seen out of you. Fucking Biggest Loser camp. Or any right-wing politician that has ever said anything so fucking stupid, it makes you want to headbutt a nail. They're going in there. You know the ones. Like-- Like those people that can't even take a mild egg to the head without trying to knock out a teenager. Get in the camp. Then what we do is we give them challenges that they cannot achieve, like keeping a cookie out of a fat kid's hand. If they fail, we give 'em paper cuts. Now, I wasn't raised by an animal, I understand that, you know, everyone's not the same. Like, the tea slurper is not on the same level as the right-wing politician. So we cut them with different grades of paper. The tea slurpers and the interrupters, they get 150 gsm. Then the people who don't thank you in traffic who have no manners, they get a 300 gsm gloss. And the right-wing politicians, we cut them with X-rays. And then we take chili oil and rub it in their wounds. I know, I've got a lot of time to think. That's what I do when you guys are at the gym. People go, "Why don't fat people just get off their fucking arses?" 'Cause we're thinking of this shit. Okay, maybe that's a little extreme. Maybe it's more like... I just think, like, other things are bigger losers-- Other people are bigger losers than actual fat people just losing weight. Like, say if you get in a car with your friend, right? They're driving. You're saying to that friend, "I trust you with the most important thing that I have: my life." 'Cause without it, you can't do shit, right? So you start driving, and 'cause you live in Melbourne, it starts to rain. They don't turn the wipers on. You know? All right. All right. I'm not going to be that person, but you know how vitally important it is for you, the passenger, to see where they're driving. Otherwise how do you know how to make the right... You don't want to say anything. So you just start scooching down in your seat a little. Just a little. 'Cause just above the dash, just under the wipers, there's always a weird half moon that you can see out of. But then you start to panic, right, and you think about that pillow that your wife bought about you living your best life. And you think, "Fuck, I do want to live my best life and I want to continue with that. I should say something." "Put the wipers on!" And they go, "Oh, shit, I didn't even notice it started raining." "You know you're driving, right?" And then because it's Melbourne, five minutes later it stops raining. They don't turn the wipers off. Not only do they visually have something in front of their eyes going, "Oh, you're fucking up here, mate..." ...audibly, there's a bit of a soundtrack, too. It gets so dry that it does that weird triple jump in front of you. When it comes back, it's like... You're not safe. You need to undo your belt, open the door and tuck and roll. Just... Those people are bigger losers than you. But, you know, because we have social media, we put ourselves into situations where you feel like a loser. 'Cause you look at other people's amazing lives, right, 'cause they have these amazing filters and amazing bullshit on their pages that you start to believe, 'cause even though, intellectually, you know it's bullshit, you know this person, they have a horrible life. But your eyes go, "It's better than yours." And then you feel like a loser. But it's not. It's like if you show up 20 minutes early to a party, you're not a loser. You're smart. 'Cause they usually have the food out. They have the food out and they're still doing the setup. So you can get involved. You go, "No, you carry on, don't worry about me." You look at their table, you go, "Guacamole looks good." "I'm going to give it a go. Just going to try it for her. Give her some valuable feedback if she needs it." So you grab a chip. Now, you're not a fool. You know to go in slow, right? You've been around food before. Don't worry. When that chip breaks... you're so disappointed in yourself, you're like, "How am I this age and I can't nail a snack?" 'Cause now you know you're in deep shit. You better get that chip out before she comes out. Don't want to fuck up the table before anyone else gets there. You're gonna take another chip. But you're gonna take a strong one. You know, the... No, 'cause you know the ones that are curved, the curved ones are structurally stronger than the others. So, you take that curve. Also, pro-tip: they always have more flavor 'cause they're sort of... Anyway, so... So you take that chip. Now, you know, you're not a fool. You're gonna go low and slow. You're gonna go low and slow, and you want to slowly curve it around the original chip. Just make it a little... You don't want to go too close 'cause then it could structurally damage the... So, you just want to go... slight-- When that second chip breaks... ...you question every decision you've ever made as an adult. "I should probably not be alone." 'Cause now you know you'd better get that out before she comes out. You've got two chips in there. You're not gonna take another chip, you're not an idiot. You're going to learn from your mistakes here. You don't want her to come out to two half dead chips in the guacamole with a fucking moat around it. When you're second knuckle in, she comes out and busts you. Like you're at your high school dance... and you just lock eyes with each other. I love that slow realization. Ooh... My hand's still in the guacamole. She walks out, she locks eyes with you. She looks at you, you look at her. She knows your hand's in the guacamole, you know your hand's in the guacamole. You look at each other, 'cause you don't know at what point... should you pull your hand out. There's no time like the present so you just pull it out. Now the bigger conundrum. Do you flick it or lick it? She just stares at you, never breaking eye contact looking over to you, just taking the bowl, going, "I wasn't that happy with it anyway." She walks in the kitchen, you can hear her throw it in the sink. You feel like such a loser 'cause you go, "It's out of season for avos, that would've cost her $400." You're not a loser, but what you didn't realize that if you normally show up 20 minutes late, the guacamole's been sitting on the table for 40 minutes slowly getting to room temperature, and then it's smooth as anything. You can fucking lift it with anything out of that bowl. You can lift it with hopes and dreams into your mouth. You don't know that because you're not a chef. Neither am I, but I'm an enthusiast. You're not a loser if you say "no, thanks" to free stuff. I say "no, thanks" to free stuff all the time but now because we live in a time where there are people who are influencers and that is a job that just involves getting free shit all day, it's unheard of when someone approaches you and goes, "You want something free?" And you go, "No, thanks." Unless it's a flyer or something. You're like, "No." But I get offered stuff all the time and I go, "No, thanks." And especially when I get on a plane, they always go, "Do you want the exit row?" Never business. Always the exit row. I go, "No, thanks." People-- Ten people back will go, "Did she just say no to the exit row?" They're so angry when I go, "No." I go, "Yeah, I don't need it." I'm five foot three. My knees have never touched another seat. 'Cause I'm mainly torso, too. Some airlines, my feet don't touch the ground. Give it to someone that needs it. I don't feel I'm trained enough to sit there anyway. I don't know where these air whores go to air school, but I haven't been. I don't think it's enough when they come up to you before the flight and they go, "Um... Did you read the A4 laminate?" And I go, "No, I didn't because it's pictures on there. And you don't read a picture, you look at it. So am I now more trained than you? Am I in charge of this flight? I'm just here for the snacks, mate. You can... You can put me near the toilet, I don't care." You're not a loser. You're not a loser if you wake up seven o'clock one morning and you go, "Hmm. Today's a shit day." Well, you know yourself, you don't need to live the whole day to know it's gonna be a shit one Sometimes you know before you open your eyes, you're like, "Yeah, today's a shit one." If you open your eyes seven o'clock in the morning and you go, "Fuck it. I'm getting blackout drunk by three..." ...then do it. Do it, it's called self-care. Look after yourself. Obviously, if that's a decision you've been making for the last 15 years every morning... ...you've got a problem. But if you do it once every 18 months to two years and go, "Today's that day," do it. Why is it socially acceptable to start drinking at noon but not at 7:00 a.m.? Like, if a friend rings you at 7:00 a.m., which would be weird, but if they ring and they go, "Hey, what are you up to?" "I just poured myself a wine." They'll think you've lost your mind. But that same friend can ring you at noon and go, "Hey, what are you up to?" "Oh. Just poured myself a wine." They go, "Well, I guess it's noon somewhere." You go, "It's noon here, Cara." I don't know why we put that amount of stress on ourselves because of a few fucking hours. Like, the amount of times I've woken up and I've taken that box wine and I've put it on the kitchen counter... ...and I just look at it, and I'm like, "Should I take the tap out and let it breathe or...?" 'Cause that's always the hardest thing with a box wine. You have to get the cover off and then you have to get that tap, and it's always real in the box. It's like... You have to put your hand in so deep, I feel like I'm working on a dairy farm. Like... "I can feel a hoof!" You get that tap out. A hundred percent of the time, the hole always faces there. You have to pull the whole sack open, sort of slowly get the tap down. I feel I lost some of you as soon as I said "box wine." You go, "Fucking box wine?" I don't care where you are in your life right now financially, but at some point, every single one of us drank box wine. Yeah. Maybe some of you are like, "I have never." Yes, you have! If you've got bogan friends, you've had box wine. I love entertaining, right? I have people over to my house all the time. And then when they go, "What should we bring?" I always go, "Just your good self, doll." And then what I do is I wash the labels off old wine bottles, and then I fill it with box wine. And not to worry, I'll even mix you a rosé. I do the whole shebang, right? So... Not once in all these years have anyone during dinner gone, "Excuse me. What fresh hell are we drinking here tonight?" No, they usually go, "Mm! Where did you get this one?" And I always go, "On my travels." And they assume... around the world. But just to the liquor store. I mean, they know the next morning. Because you know the next morning after... ...a box wine, that hangover is completely fucking different to a good wine hangover. You wake up after a good wine, right, and you have that hangover, you wake up, you're like, "Woo! Oh, that Central Otago 2009, that... ...that pinot noir nutty goodness is going to come back and bite me at around 3:30. But you know with box wine, you open your eyes, you're like, "Woo! Satan fucked my skull last night. And he's got a giant penis." You're not a loser. Drinking box wine is good for the whole family. When you're finished, you whip the box off, you give that to the cat, he plays with that. You blow up the bag and the kids play with that. You're fucking mother of the year. Yeah. You're not a loser... if after you've been to your mum's house, maybe you've had a massive feed, you've had seconds, she's given you dessert. She's even given you some leftovers in a little plastic bag because she doesn't trust you with her Tupperware. Now you have to drive with a plastic bag of spaghetti next to you. "Fuck, I hope I'm not in an accident. This is going to be hard to explain." You're full, and then you drive to the hardware store quickly 'cause you need a new tool belt. As soon as you get out of the car, you smell it. You smell that sausage sizzle. You're like, "Yeah." When you get on a plane, right, you're not hungry, you just had a nine-course dégustation. You're chockers. You go, "I'm so full." But as soon as you hear the wheels on the food cart, you panic! You panic, you're like, "Chicken! Oh." That's what it's like when you get out of your car at the hardware store, you're like... "Yes." Like, you're not there for the cuisine. Let's not fuck around. That's not good food. You know those sausages are basically vegan. They're made from wood chip and goat spit... ...and the goat donated the spit. He just looked at that and went... "I'm not eating that." But it's because there's so much joy around there. As soon as you get it, you look at those people and they're always happy, 'cause it takes a certain personality to go there every week and fucking turn sausages. You look at them, they're like... I want to be around that joy. You rummage around the car for a gold coin, you walk up to them, you give them a gold coin and then you... ...pop out your hand. There are very few instances where you as an adult can go up to another adult, put out your hand and go, "Put food on that. I've already got a bag of spaghetti in the car." They then take a napkin, put that in your hand, and then they put the thinnest white bread you've ever seen in your life on top of that. We call it magic bread at my house 'cause it's impossible to put any spread on it. You can try. But as soon as you do... ...the middle's gone. You can't even find it in the house. It's just gone. You just have this weird frame of what bread used to be. So you've got your napkin. They put the magic bread, then they put some onion, some fried-up onion, and then they put the sausage, and then... ...tomato sauce over the top of that. It's never-been-near-a-tomato sauce, let's be fair, that shit glows in the dark. Now you've got your food in your hand. Now, pro-tip: What you want to do is you want to go ahead and curve it. You want to curve that whole scenario like this, 'cause if you keep it flat, it's very hard to eat. If you keep it flat, it's called a situation. But the minute you roll it, you've got a meal. Now you walk into the hardware store and you look for other people like you. You look for the other sausage people. When you see them, you're like... "We make the same decisions. We're here... ...and we both have these. Yeah. On your... No, tool belt. Tool belt, I mean." Then you start eating and something magical happens as soon as you walk away from that barbecue. The onion is now freezing cold. But the sausage will increase in heat. There's... I think it's the glue that holds it together. So you want to approach that sucker with caution when you eat. You approach with your teeth, like a hot potato, so you can breathe through the back of it. Like, get some air on that thing. It's a very toothy approach, like your first blowjob. You walk through the shop, you're about halfway through. You look and you go, "Fuck, I'm eating the napkin too." You're not a loser, that's where the nutrients lie. But then... we do start... Do we have a snorter? That's great! I love how everyone's, "It's this lady here." It's like... It's not like she had a shit on the seat. I'll just get some water. I'll just be walking over here, getting some of this every now and again. You know, whenever I take a sip like that, the wardrobe lady is downstairs going... ...just in case I spill some of this water down my tits. 'Cause if you know me, there's a hundred percent chance that I can do that. This wasn't the top that I was supposed to wear tonight, but... ...I had a top that matched the pants. But it's got about half a liter of butter chicken on it. So, yeah, decisions were made. I said to them, I go, "Just let me wear the stained top because realistically that's how people will be seeing me in the future." It is very rare to see me in the street without food somewhere... on the tatas, but, um... Apparently, that's a big fucking no-no. All right, uh... ...here we go. Now, there are things that we do that we think we're nailing and we're not. Like thongs. Jandals. Flip-flops. Plakkies. That's what we call them in South Africa. You know, we will never have world peace... unless we can agree on a name for these shoes. Nowhere where you go in the world are they called the same. You could get on a plane right now, fly somewhere you've never been before, get off, go to a shop and go, "Excuse me. I'm looking for those summer shoes... ...that you can get your toes through like that. And then, "Oh, you're talking..." We don't even question why the fuck it's called that. We just go, "Yeah. I was hoping to buy some blue..." Now, the thing with those shoes, they don't come with instructions, and the thing is, they really should. 'Cause I never owned a pair of those 'cause I grew up on a farm in South Africa where we have snakes and scorpions and shit. So, you can't have any of that. So the first time I ever bought a pair of those was when I was in my mid-thirties, thirteen years ago in New Zealand. And no one stopped me. Like, I bought them, no one, as I got to the door, went, "Hey. Have you used those before?" You go, "No, I haven't." "Come here. Hey, just so you know... if a drop of moisture gets on the inside of that shoe... ...you're dead. Oh, and if a drop of moisture gets on the outside of that shoe... ...you're dead. Oh, and don't think for a second that you can run... ...from your car... during a thunderstorm... ...into the mall... where they've gone ahead and tiled it. 'Cause whether you're physically prepared or not, you're gonna do the full fucking splits." You're like, "Oh, okay, cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool... Cool." As you walk out, they go, "Oh, one more thing. Just so you know, those shoes? They're only for forward motion. We call them one-directional. Yeah. Oh, you want to take a step to the side? You're dead. You want to take a step back? My uncle tried that. He's dead." Those shoes are so complex, man. They should come with a warning and someone to live with you for, like, a week after you buy them. I bought a pair, my wife and I took our two kids down to Fielding, where she's from. It's a small farming community in the middle of the North Island of New Zealand. It's not as exciting as that person makes it out to be. Like, nothing happens there every half an hour and it usually lasts about an hour. So we took our kids and we showed them around a bit and then after two minutes, we were done and, uh... I... I went and strapped my two-year-old back into the car, you know, his little vaccinated arse back into the car seat. And I forgot that I was wearing these death booties, right? So you know the movement after you strap them in, you have to take a side step so you can close the door 'cause they're too weak to pull the door shut, aren't they? But as soon as I took that side step, my body just went, "Okay, we're gonna go ahead and, uh... ...go ahead and put you down at this point. Uh... You're gonna go on your ass." And my brain just went, "I... I can't stop this. You, uh... You are on your own." I was falling down so slowly that I had time to move shit out of this pocket to this pocket. I could move my handbag over and I was just walking it out. Just walking it out. I fell over so slowly, my wife had time to walk around the car, look at me and go, "What are you doing?" I said, "I'm falling over." She took out her phone, took a few photos of me and sent it to everyone in our WhatsApp group. And I learned something valuable that day. I learned that I'm officially at the age-weight ratio where I no longer fall over. I had a fall. You don't know when it will happen to you. Even five years ago, my friends would have gone, "Were you drunk?" Now I get all these concerned emojis and... "Mate, are you all right? I believe you had a fall." I'm like... "No, bitch, I was wearing my death booties. I forgot." The other thing that we think we're nailing and we're fucking not, are puffer jackets. And especially... ...especially Melbourne, you are so bad for puffer jackets. You know, today, I would classify today's weather as mild. Like, if you were one of those people that can feel the chill, maybe a long-sleeved T-shirt is for you. You know what I saw today? Two ladies walked past me and both of them had those puffer jackets that come down to mid-calf. Zipped up. I mean, that is a bold fucking statement if you zip it up. Sometimes you go, "Look, I had it at work, my hands are full so now I'm carrying it home and it's open so I still get a breeze on." When you zip it up, you're saying to people, "I'm fucking cold." But I looked at those women and I thought, "What have you heard?" I mean, honestly, wouldn't it just be spectacular come three o'clock... ...massive storm, we're up to our earlobes in snow. And just these two bitches going, "Fucking knew it." They designed those jackets so people in Antarctica don't freeze to death. Like, if you've got a colleague who's a sherpa, you need to get one of those. But if you've got a colleague named Brian who can't cope with a cup of fucking tea, you're fine. Light layering is in your future. Get a cardigan and a scarf. You're fine. So confusing when I come here 'cause I always fly into Australia then go straight to the hotel. It's all air conditioned. And then at some point, I go, "I should go for a walk, I wonder what's happening with the weather." And then you look out the window at the people in the street and you go, "Yeah. It's impossible to tell." 'Cause two thirds of you are wearing puffer jackets with shorts and death booties! I don't know what's going on. We preparing for snow or backyard cricket? You know, we all do stupid shit on a daily basis. That doesn't make you a loser. Just 'cause you're having a tough time in your life doesn't make you a loser. I think the only true losers in our society are those people who go online and attack people for shit that they cannot help. Like, if you've ever gone online and attacked someone for the way they look, what the fuck is wrong with you? Like-- During the Olympics, right, a woman won a gold medal. I read the article, good on her. And then I had a brain fart and I clicked on the comments section. If you want to lose hope in humanity, click on the comments section of your newspaper and just read that. The very first comment said, "Yeah, good on her, but what a dog." I clicked on this man's profile and I thought, "He's no oil painting. Unless someone smudged him at birth." Like-- The confidence you'd need to rock... If you're gonna attack someone for their looks, you'd better be fucking hot. Not even average looking. Fucking smoking hot. 'Cause then if you click on their profile, "Yeah, all right, fair call." But I don't understand attacking someone for their looks because it's not like she made herself. Like, if we made ourselves, we'd be stunning. I would be so beautiful, you wouldn't be able to look at me. I wouldn't need to be introduced by anyone. You'd know I'm coming 'cause you're coming. Yeah. He's going, "Oh, she's coming 'cause I'm coming!" If you truly have a problem with the way someone looks, look up their dad on Facebook and go, "Hey, bro, what happened?" Or attacking someone for their sexuality. 'Cause you know that's not a choice. Oh, God. You know that's not a choice? I thought, "Fuck me, this is the audience... This is the audience that's gonna break me," like, "It is a choice. We're here from the Baptist Church and, uh... ...we believe it is a choice and you've been making the wrong choice." "We're here to put hands on you." You know it's not a choice. Sexuality is not a choice. If it was a choice, there wouldn't be a straight woman alive. Like, no offense to men. No offense to men, I love you guys, but have you seen your balls? Those aren't your biggest asset. They're an acquired taste. I reckon the first-- If it was a choice, if sexuality was a choice, the first time a woman walks into her room where there's a naked man, she'd go "Oh. Oh... Oh... Uh... I'm gonna go look for some puss. Uh... I'm gonna leave you with that." Do you know how hard it is to explain what balls look like to a gold-star lesbian? Do you guys know what a gold star is? Okay, a gold star is a gay person who has never slept with anyone from the opposite sex. They only sleep with their own kind, the way God would want it. So-- Oh, wait, actually, gay dudes can be platinum stars. They are ones that have never slept with anyone from the opposite sex and they were born via cesarean. So, even on the day they came out, they had a look and went, "Fuck no! Take me out through the sunroof!" So... Do you know how hard it is for me to explain to a gold-star lesbian what balls look like? 'Cause I've seen a fair few in my fucking time. I go, "Well, basically, it's like... It's like... It's like... two rotten kiwi fruit... ...had a baby with some old tea bags and they just keep getting longer and longer and longer. You guys have been amazing! Thank you so much for having me. Thank you, Melbourne!
