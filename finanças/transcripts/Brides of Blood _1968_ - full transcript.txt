(anticipatory music) (foreboding music) - What for you want to bury yourself in that island? Nobody visits Blood Island, except this ship. And that is once every six months! - Why that's a very good question, Captain. I suspect my husband thinks of it as an act of atonement. Mostly for me. - This is something I've been looking fon/vard to doing for a long time, believe it or not. - Well this is absolutely your last chance. The search is fine, but they'll find it. - You know, ljust might take you up on that. - You know you just might have a mutiny on your hands Captain, and I can't say I'd blame the crew. - Gallantry from the Peace Corps? Why I'm overwhelmed. - Any mutiny, I can handle. - Maybe I could help the captain keep the crew happy. (laughing) - I better see to my gear. - Me too. - Would you like me to help? - If you like. - Isn't that what a good wife is for. (laughing) Get out of my way. - You can stop that, now get in there. - Aren't you growing up a little fast, little boy? - You tell me. (foreboding music) (speaking foreign language) - Captain, thank you. - Don't worry about the ship, I'll take care of it. - Carla? - I've never seen so many sad faces. Sad and frightened. - Then maybe you should remain on board and take up my offer. - Perhaps if you were a little bit younger, Captain. - Oh Paul don't be tiresome. (laughing) (speaking foreign language) (foreboding music) Here comes the local rotary club. - Let's go meet them. (tribal music) (screaming) (chanting in foreign language) - This is where you dwell. My granddaughter and I, we stay there. - Arcadio, what did those women really die of? - I told you, accident. - What kind of an accident Arcadio? - Oh, here's my granddaughter now, Alma. - Hello Alma. She's very lovely. - Alma has studied in the mainland, she will be your interpreter. Besides myself, she's the only one that speaks English on this island. - Not the only one Lolo, you're forgetting Mr. Powers and Goro. We know that you have come to do us good, W6 8T6 your SGFVGHtS. - Well I'm supposed to say at this point that uh, we're here to serve, not to be served. I only hope it works out that way. - I too. - I'm Jim Farrell, this is beside us Dr. Henderson, his wife. - You're most welcome, it will give me great pleasure to do what I can, to help. - Well I'm afraid Paul won't be very much help to you in the pleasure department dear, now young Farrell here, maybe you and I could? - Carla. After a rather hectic morning I had hoped you could manage to forget the subject for the rest of the day. - Well let's get this stuff inside huh? (speaking foreign language) - Oh light, oil lamp? - N0, petroleum. - Last year when the authorities in the mainland instructed me to provide food and shelter for you, conditions were different. - In what way, Arcadio? - This place was a little paradise. Last year would have been the time to come. - I was led t0 believe that we were welcome here, this year or any year. - You still are Mr. Jim. We are ashamed. - Alma, we didn't come here expecting to find laundromats and supermarkets. - We wish we had asked you t0 return where you came from. Why the ship was still here. - I don't understand. - We have gone back to primitive ways. There are things which we do now, that we did not do before. - How have you returned to primitive ways? - It is as my grandfather says, we have returned to the ways of our ancestors, and we are not too proud of it. (foreboding music) (speaking foreign language) - They want t0 know if you're a carpenter Jim. - N0 I'm classified as an instructor in community action. In Colombia were I first served they called it uh, (speaking foreign language). (speaking foreign language) Explain to your people that I'm hereto help them improve their village, not to run it, now this is a health center we're making, next a schoolhouse, maybe even an irrigation system! But they've got to do the work themselves. (ominous music) That's the weirdest looking plant I've ever seen, what is it? (speaking foreign language) Something wrong? - [Carla] Made any earthshaking discoveries yet, Dr. Henderson? - I won't know until I get this under a microscope. What time is it? - It's about 4:30, it's too early for a sunset, but there it is. (foreboding music) Ah, it's so peaceful here. I'm not one of your specimens Paul. - N0 you're not. Sometimes I think it would be a lot simpler for me if you were. - Yes I guess it would. Let's go back before get lost in the dark. - What's the matter? - That thing... What is it? - Some kind of a land crab I think, but... - Paul, I'm frightened let's go back now. (anticipatory music) Paul that sunset. - A trick of the atmosphere. - Is that all it is? Why is everything so still? - It's just your imagination Carla, come on. (foreboding tribal music) - What's going on? - I don't know. I don't know if I want t0. - Come 0n let's get outta here. (ominous music) - Welcome t0 Blood Island. I bring greetings from my master, Mr. Esteban Powers. He has a table prepared for you. Please, follow me. - Well you've gotta admit, he's got style. (ominous music) - The master regrets the lack of transportation, this way please. (eerie howling) - Isn't that some kind of a banana tree. - The bark is definitely (mumbling). But that growth there, I've never seen anything like that before. - Paul, it's moving. - Yes... - Please, hurry. - Come on we'll have time for a closer look in the morning. (ominous music) Must be over a hundred years old. (frantic piano music) (speaking foreign language) - Master, your guests. - Fellow Americans. I'm Esteban Powers. Esteban. - Jim Farrell. - The Peace Corps man? - Right. - And Dr. Henderson? - How do you do? - Mrs. Henderson. - Carla to my friends, and enemies. - I hope never to belong t0 the second category. - I don't think you'll ever have to worry about that. - I must apologize for not having been able to meet you. I would have wanted to bring all of you here directly, but if it's not too late, I would like to invite all of you t0 stay here for the duration of your visit. - Well I don't know about Paul and Carla, but uh, I really can't even begin to do my work unless I live with the people. - You don't have to be that democratic do you doctor? - Well I uh-- - We accept. Paul you know you'll do much better work after you've had a nice, hot shower and slept in a honest-to-goodness bed. - Well under those circumstances, how can I refuse? - It's settled then, shall we? I must warn you doctor that you'll find rne an incurable dilatant, I'm afraid you'll find me breathing down your neck, Mrs. Henderson. Jim. Doctor. (whip snapping) (speaking foreign language) - What's that? - Stop it Goro. - This belongs to Dr. Henderson. - It's your flare gun Paul. - I must've dropped it somewhere. - And the poor fellow happened to pick it up. You didn't give Bulon a chance t0 return it, Goro. I hope G0r0's unfortunate display of temper hasn't spoiled your appetite. - Well he is a little different. - He's not as sinister as he seems t0 be. Fact is, I wouldn't know what t0 do without him. Appearances t0 the contrary, he would be a top overseer in any plantation. - Your property sir. - Thank you. I didn't really expect t0 get lost on the island, but ground rules are ground rules. - Just what do you expect to find here, doctor? - This island was on the fringe of the atomic radiation area during the bomb tests in the late '40s. - Declared safe, then, as now. - That's why I didn't expect to find any effect of the bomb tests on the flora and fauna of the island. - Didn't expect? - I found a crab, an ordinary land crab that had undergone some kind of mutation, and also manifested a very high degree of radioactivity. - Well couldn't it have migrated from Bikini or one of the other islands to the test area? - Well assuming that it survived the bomb blast, that would seem like the logical explanation. - Migraine. Have you found high radioactivity in any other creature on the island? - N0, not yet. - Then Jim's explanation is probably valid. - The trouble is, if any other living thing on the island has been affected by atomic radiation, only the crab would show evidence of strontium-90, not any other creature. - Why? - When a crab molts, it eats its own shell, thereby reabsorbing its own radioactivity. - Well what about the other creatures? - That would depend on inference or other evidence. - What other evidence Paul? - You got me there, I really don't know, mutation, possibly. - Mutation? - Inexplicable organic variations in animal of plant life. - How long will it take you to determine whether any other creature besides the crab have been affected? - A day, a month, depends on a lot of things. - Could this mutation infect humans as well? - I don't know. - Theoretically, doctor, would it be possible? - Theoretically anything is possible. (ominous music) (eerie howling) (screaming) - Paul, Paul get it off of me please, Paul! Paul! Paul, Paul, help me! - Come on, come on! (screaming) (laughing) - Oh Paul, Paul... (screaming) - This way. (chanting in foreign language) (ominous music) (chanting in foreign language) - Return to your homes there is nothing you can do for them. (speaking foreign language) (ominous music) (chanting in foreign language) (ominous growling) - Earthquake? - NO- (bug buzzing) - Paul. - It's a tropical variety of the (mumbling). - It's changing shape. " Ow! - Paul! - Carla first aid kit, quick! - Take it easy I'm not hemorrhaging. (eerie growling) - Paul, what's happening here? - It seems that some living organisms on this island, are undergoing drastic mutation. (eerie growling) (screaming) - Please Mr. Farrell. - We can't leave those women out there to be murdered. - There's nothing anyone can do for them. They are dead even now. - Please Jim, what my grandfather says is true. - I'm prepared to stop you at all costs, Mr. Farrell. - Listen. It stopped. (weeping) (sad music) - Must be some way of stopping that animal. - [Alma] It wasn't an animal Jim. - Well it wasn't a man either, so maybe it was an evil spirit huh? - Please don't be angry. - Are you serious? Can anyone here be happy or okay, even resigned, to the idea of having himself and his entire family just wiped off of the face of the earth? - The men survive this because it needs only women. - What do you mean? What the devil do you mean? - He does not devour his victims. He merely satisfies himself on them. - But they get torn to pieces. - It is his way of satisfying himself. (speaking foreign language) - Well come 0n. - N0! (speaking foreign language) - Can't say that I blame them. - Paul, if that thing came out of the jungle, aren't we taking an awful chance that... Well I'm even afraid to say it. - Powers' place is built like a fort, it'll be safer there for you, besides he isn't likely to go out of his mind with fear. Come on. (foreboding music) - Paul. When we are, if we ever get back-- - Carla, you'd rather scare yourself into a fit if you don't watch out. - I'm not frightened now. I was thinking of you. - About me? Now that certainly sounds like a classic hysteria symptom. - Paul haven't you ever thought of getting a divorce? - Have you? - I, what would I have to gain? Wouldn't change anything for me. A divorce would get me off your hands for good. I don't think I'd contest it. I just hate t0 feel that I owe anybody anything. - Don't feel that way then. - Oh Paul you're such an unbelievable stoic. Why do you put up with me? - I wouldn't lose any sleep over that if I were you. I gave up on you a long time ago. - Sometimes I wish that were true. - What's the point of all of this? You wanna see me wallow in self pity? - It could be that, it could also be that in spite of what I am there's a part of me that's still in love with you. You couldn't possibly believe that could you? - It isn't easy for either of us, is it? - [Carla] Paul. - Good morning. - Good morning. - I am sent to escort you, your bags. (calming music) - That's the same tree we saw here yesterday, but it didn't look at all like that. - Sometimes Dr. Henderson, the nighttime 0n this island is different to the eyes. (calming music) - It could be a lot easier to practice crop rotation with this new irrigation system. - I will tell them. (speaking foreign language) - Sedition in the ranks? - N0, a private joke, it has nothing to do with the work. - [Jim] Okay, let's get this work done huh? Tomorrow we cut the closed poles for the bamboo network. The bamboo poles for the closed network. (mystical music) - However I did send a report through Captain Macbee. - D0 you offer any opinions in these reports? - They expect me to. - What was your opinion? - That the recent killings may have been committed by a maniac. - A maniac? - A crazed, murderous sadist. - Also a man. Assuming it was a man, possessing an unnatural degree of physical strength. Those women were literally torn limb from limb. - Paul. - Master, I am on my way to the wine cellar. (speaking foreign language) - How about a little sherry before dinner? - I'm sorry, I suppose I'll get used to him eventually. - Come, we'll have a better view of the sunset over there, unmatched by any other sunset in the world. - [Carla] It's beautiful. - I'm puzzled by this, Esteban. Today's sunset is well, breathtakingly beautiful of course. But otherwise, it's quite normal. Yesterday the very air we breathed seemed to have a gloomy atmosphere. - Like a mortuary light reflected from a corpse. (laughing) I'm sorry but that's the way I felt yesterday. - All in the eye of the beholder. I've lived here practically all my life and I assure you I've never felt that way, there as I said, unmatched by any other. (mystical music) (eerie howling) (screaming) (speaking foreign language) (screaming) - Alma? Alma? (foreboding music) (speaking foreign language) Alma, Alma! Look listen to me, look we can fight this thing, whatever it is, we can destroy it. Look, just trust rne huh? Just let rne go, I promise you you won't regret it, ljust wanna help you, ljust wanna-- (speaking foreign language) (chanting in foreign language) (groaning) - Mr. Farrell, no! - I don't wanna fight you Arcadio, but I will. - Jim, you'll endanger the village. Jim! (ominous music) (screaming) (flare gun fires) (grunting) ~ Jim? - It's over you're safe now. - But you don't understand... - It's all right, come on. Open up, open up, it's Alma! - Jim, they won't let us in. - Here. They're gone. - They don't like what you've done. - Here put this on, hurry. (foreboding music) It's awful quiet. - The evil has lifted, We can go to the jungle now. - You mean run away? - We'll both be killed if we remain here. - By who, your own people? - They believe that the evil one will come back and that it's angry on the entire village. - Then we gotta make 'em realize how foolish and dangerous it is to believe that. - Jim? (ominous music) - Stand back. (fare gun fires) (speaking foreign language) ~ Jim? I'm afraid. - Why? You'll be safe in that house, safe from the evil one, safe from your own people, come on. - Welcome to the master's house, Mr. Farrell. (speaking foreign language) - We've come to accept your master's hospitality, if his 0ffer's still open. - Of course, this way. Please, sit down. - Hello Carla. - Well hello indeed! This isn't a social visit, is it? Have you been a naughty boy Jim? - We defied the wicked spirits, we got the whole village chasing us, where's Esteban? - He's not feeling well, he had some type of an attack last night, he calls it migraine. Paul thinks it's epilepsy. - Is Paul asleep? - Oh no, he'll be awake for the next three days, he's quite excited about the little monster he's captured. - Hey Jim, wait till you see what I've got, come here, you've never seen anything like this in your life. - Carla tells me you caught a monster. - A cockroach straight out of H.G. Wells. - Well, a cockroach all right. - You should've seen this little beast, had horns and fangs, and even tried to attack a lizard. You saw it, didn't you Carla. - Jim I did see it. - Could somebody have substituted this one for the one You've got? - What on earth for, I was here all the time, I only left the room just now to call you in here. - Well maybe it mutated itself back to its original shape? If that's possible. - I've seen it happen to a banana plant, even t0 the very air we breathe around here. - If you do not mind sir, I shall show you t0 your rooms. - [Jim] What about Alma? - There's a vacant room, next to yours. - Good come on, good night Paul, Carla. (foreboding music) - Uh Goro what do you want? - The master is not to be disturbed Mrs. Henderson. - I uh, just wanted t0 know if he was awake. - You're Arcadia's granddaughter aren't you? - Yes sir. Please forgive me for intruding Mr. Powers. - You're most welcome here, Alma, for as long as you care to stay. - Thank you sir. - Goro tells me that the villagers are after you, is this true? - Yeah I seem to have offended the evil one when I cut her loose last night. - This is really quite terrible. It's idiotic of me not to have a radio transmitter. As it is we're completely cut off. - Well what about those fishing boats out there? - The (speaking foreign language)? It's over 300 miles of rough and open sea t0 the nearest large island. We haven't got (speaking foreign language) big enough to make the crossing. - So we're trapped? In the meantime this beast just continues t0 wallow in an orgy of blood. - Has anyone ever seen him or it? - I don't know of anyone alive who has. I fainted just before he could get to me. - I'm thinking of setting a trap for our monster, with the villagers' help. - I doubt if you can even get them t0 come out of their homes right now. - When I am ready I will just have to make them. - Paul, please don't stray too far away from the house. - Don't worry there isn't a monster a live who can outrun me, but I'll stay close. - I could keep you company if you're sure I won't be in the way. - Well I wouldn't wanna take you from your work. - Oh there isn't that much for me t0 do. - Oh but Esteban you said you were gonna show me your wife's mosaics. - They'll still be there when we get back. I do need to get out of house, Paul. - Well I won't pretend I wouldn't feel better having you around. - You know I haven't used one of this in a long time. - Let's hope we don't need it. - And that, if we do need it, it can help. - Now here's another one that died before it had a chance t0 revert back to its original nature. - In your long experience Paul, have you run across anything like this before? - Never. Even in circumstances exactly like this. I can't even begin to form a theory until I have a pattern, for one thing, why haven't the people on this island been affected by mutation? - That's easy, they weren't on this island when the bombs were exploded on Bikini. - You mean they were evacuated and then returned when the island was declared safe? - N0, they'd never set foot on the island before the test. They were sent from resettlement centers after the explosions. - Then they couldn't possibly have been affected by the bomb tests. - So you do tend to favor the notion that the tests had something to do with causing this mutation? - For the time being, yes, but we don't have enough evidence t0 support the wildest theory. (calming music) - She was an extremely gifted woman. Strange, there's a very strong Spanish influence in her work. - Not so strange, she was a Spanish. I'm half Spanish myself you know. My mother's forebearers were the first Europeans t0 come to this island, first to settle here. They established a rather important trading base, built this house, then my father came along and met my mother who was an only daughter, end of Spanish regime. - But you were educated in the States weren't you? - Not really, a couple of years of college. Then I went t0 Spain, the Royal University of Barcelona. That's where I met Beatrice, my wife. We were both very young. But when the war broke out, everything seemed so-- - Wait a minute are you talking about the Spanish Civil War? - Yes. - That was 30 years ago. - So it was. - But uh, that'd make you closer to 50 at least. - You're right again. - But that's incredible. You don't look a day over 30. - Welcome to Shangri-La, my friends. - If you'll excuse a rather indelicate non-sequitur, Esteban what did your wife die of? - N0 one knows for certain. She developed a fever, we flew her back t0 the mainland, but the doctors there couldn't do anything for her. And then her complexion suddenly changed. - Changed, in what way? - Discolored. She grew darker by the day, almost by the hour. In spite of the fever, which she couldn't shake off, she seemed quite well otherwise. Then one day, suddenly, she died. She died in, in terrible pain. The pain came all at once and simply overwhelmed her. - Forgive me my stupid curiosity. - N0, please don't apologize, I want to talk about it. - Did your wife die within a year of the bomb tests? - I knew you'd ask me that. It was our 15th anniversary when Beatrice talked rne into taking a vacation. A cruise among the islands. We had a 30 foot boat, no radio. And we learned much later that we had come within range of radiation area. - But you weren't affected in any way. - I suspect all I got out of it, was this, this schoolgirl complexion. - Master? It is time again for your medicine. (ominous music) (eerie growling) (screaming) - Esteban! (screaming) (growling) (screaming) - Jim, Jim wake up! - What's the matter? - Carla's missing! - Did you look around the house? - Yes I've looked all over the house, I'm going out. - Wait a minute wait a minute, look before we go stumbling out in the jungle in the middle of the night, did y0u-- - I've looked in Esteban's room, he's not there neither is she. - Is anything wrong? - Carla's gone. - Sorry I woke you Alma. - You need not be, Mr. Henderson. - My flare gun's missing. - Here take this. - Stay close t0 me huh? (anticipatory music) ' [Paul] Carla? Carla! (screaming) (gun fires) - She can't go on any further, let's go back. - But what about Carla'? - We don't even know where t0 start looking for her, we're just running in a panic. " Jim! - Carla! - Paul wait! - Jim! - Carla, Carla? Carla answer me it's Paul, Carla? Carla! - Paul? - [Goro] Dr. Henderson. - Where's Carla'? - [Goro] Return to the house, Dr. Henderson. - What have you done with my wife? What have you done with her? - [Goro] It is no use, you are too late. (anticipatory music) (groaning) (gun fires) - He's coming back. ~ Jim? - Esteban? - I had an attack. Epilepsy. Woke up in the middle of the jungle and... Who is that? - Paul, Goro killed him. - Goro'? Are you sure? - We saw it happen Mr. Powers. - I think I wounded him, he couldn't get very far. - I didn't expect this of Goro. But now we've got to stop him before he can harm other people. It's all right Jim, I think I can manage by myself now. _ Qkay- (anticipatory music) Esteban! I can't find my flare gun. - I slipped, hurt my arm, I'm afraid we have to wait till morning. - Esteban we can't! Look there's no telling what Goro might do, even now. - I'm sorry. - Well let me take a look at it. - N0, no! - Jim... _ Qkay- (anticipatory music) (growling) (foreboding music) - Jim wait. It seems to be coming from the house. - Yeah. Well we can't stop now, at least Esteban's armed. (growling) (anticipatory music) (eerie howling) we gotta figure out some way of reaching the village. (ominous music) ~ Jim? Jim! - Alma? Alma! (screaming) - Leave me Jim, it's me he wants. - We're almost there, get up! (anticipatory music) (growling) (gun fires) - Master you are safe now. The sickness will pass away as always. (growling) (screaming) (gun fires) (gun clicks) - Arcadio, Arcadio! - Lolo, Lolo open up! Lolo we need your help. - You have endangered your people twice already. I must return you to your place at the altar. " N0! Now you listen to me, if we fight this monster together we can defeat it! - You say that once before! - Yeah! And you did nothing. You preferred t0 quake like frightened women here in your homes. - What can we do now? (growling) (anticipatory music) (speaking foreign language) (growling) (screaming foreign language) - Alma's in there, we gotta stop it! (screaming) Alma! (screaming) (growling) (triumphant music) (tribal drumming music) (singing in foreign language) (calming music)
