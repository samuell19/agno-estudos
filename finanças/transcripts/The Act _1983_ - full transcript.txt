I'm gonna try to do whatever I can for you, but I am running late. - This time you better listen to me. - Okay, I'll listen. Just remember, I got a plane to catch. - Yeah, I guess somethings never change, do they? - Harry, cut the bullshit. - How you getting along with your new boss? - The President of the United States is a very demanding man, Harry, just like you were. - Like I was, like I am! Come on, don't start putting me down now, don't put me in a past tense. I want out of here. - I heard about what happened with the parole board, I'm truly sorry about that. - Forget it, that was yesterday. Aren't you gonna ask me about this robe? - It crossed my mind, yeah. - Uh, you must've heard of Mahatma Gandhi. - Yeah. - Well, that little dink was some piece of work. You know when he stopped eating, the whole British Empire collapsed. What do you think would happen if me, Harry Kruger, stopped eating? - Look, I don't have time for this, my plane's leaving in a few minutes. - It'll wait! If it doesn't, there'll be another one. I didn't ask you to come here to waste time. It'll be front page news on every newspaper in the world. When I stop eating, it's gonna be the lead in on every network news show. - [Man] Harry, you're having delusions. - No, no, because when Harry Kruger stops eating, the country stops eating. The day after the news breaks about my hunger strike, my union, my boys, boys that I started in the union with, friends who never forgot Harry, are gonna slam shut the door on every refrigerator in America, and that's why when Harry Kruger stops eating, the country stops eating! What do you think of that? - I'm not sure. - Yeah, that's right, sit down. Take a couple of minutes, digest my idea. - Well, like you said, there's always another plane. - Not for me, this is my last shot. You've gotta explain it so that Frankie Boda and the man in the White House understand that. They're both running for reelection next year, huh? Right? They'll never win if they let me starve. - Harry, I wanna break this to you gently, but a lot of people wish you were dead. - Oh, yeah, but there ain't a lot of people willing to go hungry. Tucker, if our union trucks don't bring the food into the supermarkets, nobody eats, nobody! - Harry, you're not the President of the Union anymore, Frankie Boda, he's very happy to have you right here. You can be certain he's not gonna tell the ranking father's to support this hunger strike. - Frankie Boda wouldn't piss on me if I were on fire! Who needs him? It's easy for him to forget that I found him on a warehouse dock! I put him in a position of power! Boda, but the rest of the people that I picked up along the way, they're still running most of the Union locals, and they don't forget Harry. I tell you, if I starve, you'll see the biggest wildcat strike in history, take my word! It's all said! - Except no one's gonna believe that you're responsible for the strike. - Everybody's gonna know that I'm responsible for the strike! I can still get Cronkite and Brinkley, Barbara Walters, Reynolds, just like I can make you come! - Harry, they're gonna say you're stir crazy. - I am stir crazy, that's why I want out of here! And that's why I will be out of here by Christmas! - That's less than four months. - Yeah, you can do it. - I wish it was as simple as you make it seem. - It's very simple, you're the key. Now, you're still a lawyer for the Union, so you go to Boda and you get the Union's endorsement for the President's reelection in return for my release. A presidential pardon, yeah, yeah, it will work, it will work. - It's more complicated than you think. - Look, it's not as complicated as my sitting down and stopping eating! Now, you tell Boda and the President I gotta be out of here by Christmas, that's the deadline! - I'll let you know what they say. - No, you won't let me know. None of that I'll talk to you tomorrow, I'll get back to you, I'll call you on Monday! You tell me right now you'll do it! - Harry, it looks like an election deal, nobody has any time to make this-- - Time, what the hell you know about time, you bloodless bastard! - Take it easy, Harry. Harry, what are you doing? - Christmas or I die and you go with me! - I'll try it, Harry. I'll really try. Wait a minute. (tape whirring) Yeah, let's go. (deep dramatic music) (airplane whooshing) - Hello. - Hello, Frankie. - Good to see you. - Nice to see you. - Don, I know you don't care for wine, but you must let me pour you a glass of this. It's a very friendly little (mumbles) someone introduced to me last year at the Paris Convention. - I'm glad to hear that you've accomplished something over there. (man laughing) - Don, you remind me of every school teacher and social worker, and truant officer that tried to convince me that I should be so happy to remain a longshoreman all my life long. - That's very nice, but let's talk about Harry Kruger. - At the risk of sounding insensitive, I don't really care whether Harry Kruger dies slowly or rapidly, whether he jumps or starves, just as long as he does it in the slammer where he can't harm me. - Harry might be less of a problem outside jail than inside. - Not for me, he wouldn't. I can't run the Union having to look over my shoulder all the time, wondering what Harry the horse is doing. Oh, it's okay with me if he wants to go on a starvation diet, I think that's cool. - Well, it could embarrass you in a rank and filed memberships hears Harry talking like Mahatma Gandhi. - Oh, Mahatma Gandhi's ass. Harry Kruger is a ten hard Napoleon. He thinks he's on Elba planning a comeback. He's making lists of all the people that he's gonna screw or have killed when he gets out, and would you like to guess who's at the top of everyone of those list's, me. No, I'll keep Harry inside. (bell ringing) - I know, Frankie, but he's got you in a no win situation. - Are the rank and file are gonna want you to take some action, they're not gonna be happy seeing one of their own suffer. You cannot let Harry Kruger die. - Says who? - Your own people! Now, they think you let Harry die because you're scared of him, they'll turn on you like a pack of dogs. If they think you didn't have the clout to go to the President to save him, they'll turn their backs on you. They'll never listen to you again, either way, you lose. - That's very good for a year lawyer, Don, but there's one important fact that you've left out. If I get flushed down the toilet, the President goes along for the ride. He loses five million votes, and if that happens, you and your new boss are gonna be back on the street chasing tow trucks. - President of the United States wants your friendship, Frankie, he doesn't need it. Last election, yes, but next year, we'll get the numbers with or without the Union. - Oh, bullshit, Donnie boy, everybody needs five million votes, but just leave that. With Harry on the outside, he's going to be a pain for both of us, you know that. - Are you scared of Harry Kruger? - Sure. He's like a father to me, of course I'm scared of him. - I suppose we all are. What if I could work out something that would keep him off you? - Like what? - A piece of paper, a binding agreement that he could not become involved in Union activities as a condition for a presidential pardon. - He'd never sign it. - What if I could arrange it? (soft piano music) - Harry would never let go of the Union. - But if I can? - If you can get him to sign it, I'll do anything you want, and I'll be at the front gate when they spring Harry with a brass man. Do you think the President will do it for me? - Mark down the date Christmas Eve, Frankie. I got a plane to catch. (exciting rock music) - Where have you been, Tucker? - Are you talking to me? - Excuse me, sir, but the President has been asking for you every 15 minutes. - Well, I'm here now, right. - Yes, sir. (soft piano music) (dogs barking) - Okay, Lieutenant. - Yes, Sir. - Morning, Mr President. Frankie Boda sends his warmest personal regards. - Bet your ass he did. (man laughing) Don, you know what you get when you pass a Pollack with a member of the press? - Even you're gonna like this, Don. - Nothing, somethings even a Pollack won't do. (men laughing) What did Boda say? - He's afraid to have Harry Kruger on the outside. I don't blame him, Harry Kruger's a very tough man. - How can we be sure Kruger isn't bluffing? - Harry never bluffs. I'll tell you something about Harry Kruger, I remember about 10 years ago, just before a big rally, someone shot Harry in the arm, happened right in his hotel suite, we all stood there, frozen, but Harry, he grabbed the guy and broke his neck. - I didn't read about this. - We never released it. Harry didn't want anyone to know that he was vulnerable. - One of his own people, huh? What did I tell you? - Well, let him finish, let him finish. - Harry changed his jacket, he didn't want anyone to see the blood, then he went out and gave his speech. It was 2:00 in the morning before we could get him to a doctor. - Now, that is what I call tough. - He would do it, wouldn't he? That son of a bitch would starve himself to death just to ruin me, to bring this country down. Cons are always getting killed in jail, nobodies, they get stabbed by other cons, right? Or hang themselves out of desperation? How come it's always nobodies, never somebody who's a danger to the national security? - He could choke to death on a piece of meat. Now, that's done all the time. - You fat jerkoff, how can you choke on a piece of meat when you're on a hunger strike? You worked for him a long time, didn't you? You knew him real well. - As well as anyone. - If he got out and got back on top, you'd go back to work for him, wouldn't you? - You implying something? - I don't have to imply, I'm the President. I'm asking you a direct question. - I'll give you a direct answer, I work for you, I'm loyal to you, if you doubt it, fire me. - So you could go to work for Kruger? - Sir? - Answer me, Tucker. - If you start this bullshit now, I'm gonna go home. Now, this man has busted his butt for you. If you wanna kick ass, go over to the Pentagon, that's where they need it. - You see, Don, see what they're doing to me? To the Presidency, to the country? Trying to bring it down. The devil's at the gates, the drags are plotting in the jail cells. I can't be sure of anybody anymore. All right, Don, this is what you get paid for, what are we going to do? - The most acceptable solution would be to pardon him on a condition that he refrain from any Union activity for a period of, say, 10 years. - That's a beautiful thought, Don, it really is, but it isn't Constitutional, is it? - No, it isn't, but it would put him on hold for a while, by the time courts sorted it all out, who knows, he could be eating meat again. (man laughing) - You hear that, Corky? What'd I tell you about J Donald? - You said he'd go through a brick wall for you. - I did, I said that. Look, Don, what do we get out of all this? - We got Boda's support, that might be the only Union endorsement you get and it's a good one, it's worth five million votes. - Well, we're gonna get the numbers this time with, or without, Boda. What else are we getting? - Continuation of a very warm and rewarding relationship. - Eh, could be better. What do you say, Corky? - Maybe a little sweetener, what they call political action support. - Sure, what do they have these organizing funds for anyway? - You can start that intelligence unit, the one you were talking about for the reelection. - Tell Boda I can get his can off completely, and he owes me for it. The Union will endorse my reelection, and I want him to make a contribution of one million dollars... (fingers snapping) Two million, cash. - What? - Yeah, I want him to deliver the two million to you, in cash, on a strictly business basis, 10 days after he gets Kruger freed? - I don't think-- - Don't, it's a good idea not to. - It's your decision, of course, but this might be construed as a form of-- - Blackmail? By that greaseball, we help to put him in, we can help to put him out and he knows it. - Frankie Boda is not exactly what you would call a pushover, Sir. - What are you saying to me? I'm the President of the United States. I'm sitting here with my finger in the dike, I'm sitting here all alone while every two bit radical, every mush mouth faggot conman is trying to knock this Constitution on its ass and turn the country into a commie prison farm. It's about time freeloaders like Boda start paying their share, because if they don't, and mark my words, it just isn't going to be any democratic system left for them to rip off. - I guess I'll get right on it, Sir. - Yeah, yeah, you do that. Who the hell do these guys think they are? They think I'm gonna lie down for them? - Well, how about some lunch, Don? - Why don't you stay for lunch, Don? I just had some prawns flown in, strategic air command dropped them off. They were in the Yellow Sea yesterday. - We can watch the Redskins on TV. They're gonna have a hell of a season this year. - Thank you, but I think I better get going.

(loud pounding) (soft exciting music) (mumbles) - We've got customers. - Civilians or more competition? - I can't tell, but they're making a hell of a racket out there. - They're gonna wake up the whole street. - Okay, let them in, take the front desk, I'll back you up. Come on, let's go. - Come on, come on, open up! Some nerve of these people. (loud knocking) Come on, let's go! Hey, hey, hey! - You know who! (people yelling) - Thank you. - It's cold out tonight. - There you go. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. (lighthearted rock music) - We'll need a room for tonight. - I'm sorry, we're completely booked up. - Look, that's ridiculous, I wanna talk to the manager. - He's tied up at the moment. I suggest you try the Pierre. - How about the Pierre? - Oh, come on, honey, just get us a room, huh. I gotta get off my feet. - Come on, you got something, you people always keep something tucked away for emergencies. - Sir, the Savoy's a very popular hotel. It's always good to book in advance. - [Man] Come on, you people always keep an extra room for the last minute big shots. You can't tell me you don't have an extra room! - [Man Behind Desk] I'm sorry. - Well, here's something that might help persuade you. - Sir, we just don't have anymore rooms. I suggest maybe the Pierre, the Plaza. - Look, it's god damn cold out there, and I'm not going out there again, and I'm not gonna drag this little lady out there either. - Well, sir, if you insist. - I do insist. - Okay, I think maybe we can accommodate you. This way, please. (light knocking) - What's this? - [Woman] A stick up? - You can't do-- - Turn around. - Don't worry, folks, it's all on the house, come on. - Tie them up, put them with the rest.

I have to get my exercise in everyday, it keeps the gut down, you know? - Yeah, I can see that. - But she's beautiful, isn't she? - Listen, I'm running late, I've got a plane to catch, is there someplace we can talk? - Yeah, come on, come on. Don, have a drink. - No, thank you. The President is willing to go along with the deal. A pardon for Harry if he signs a condition restricting him from any Union activity for 10 years. - 10 years, that's long enough for me. A lot of things can happen in 10 years. Well, that's beautiful, Don. When do you want the endorsement? - As soon as possible, some early Union backing could help a lot right now. - You can have it by the end of the week, you just give my law guy like two days notice. Listen, we're gonna have to get together. You call me the next time you're in the city, we'll have lunch, right? - I'm not quite finished. - Oh? - There's some cash involved. (man laughing) - Some cash involved, like a baseball (mumbles). Come on. (man laughing) - I'm serious, two million dollars cash. - You're not serious, Donnie, you're crazy. Two million dollars cash. - That's it. - Mmm hmm, and when am I gonna get two million dollars? - All right, Frankie, don't waste my time. I'm talking to the guy who helped Harry set up that organizing fund. - Two million dollars, just like that? How'd you guys arrive at that particular figure? I mean, why not three million dollars, five million dollars, 10 million dollars. - Fair market price. - Come on. - Look at it this way, for a relatively small sum, you're solving all of your problems. It's just a business deal, one president to another. - Well, you go tell your President that this President says no, N-O, you tell your President he's not getting a cent from me. - Frankie-- - Hey, hey, hey. - The man is serious, he wants a contribution, a show of faith, if he doesn't get it, he'll pardon Harry without any conditions whatsoever. - He's not gonna do that. - You know he would, he is a very strong willed man. - He's a spiteful pussy. - Exactly. - When do you people want your pond of flesh? You tell your President that he's not getting one cent from me until he delivers his end of the deal. - No problem, he trusts you. He'll spring Harry on Christmas Eve, he wants you to deliver the cash to me 10 days after delivery, 10 days after Harry is on the street. - There's the business deal between two Presidents, huh? - It's all business, Frankie, nothing's personal. - Don, you got a plane to catch. And I'd hate to see you miss it. And I hope you understand what I mean. - I hope you understand what I mean. (solemn slow music) - I can't sign this. You know I can't sign this. - Oh, you can sign it, you can sign it, Harry, because it's your ticket out of this place. - My ticket nowhere, what am I gonna do when I get out? - You can always spin cotton. - Huh? - Sit at a spinning wheel like your new idol, Mahatma Gandhi. - He wouldn't make this deal either. - It is your best and only option. - Like hell it is. - Come on, Harry, you got nearly two million dollars going for a pension fund, be able to travel, spend time with the family, relax. - Relax, and where am I gonna relax, some retirement village? Maybe play backgammon all day or do I sign that away too? - The only job you cannot take is Union activities, that's the deal-- - Only Union activities, that's my life! It's my whole life, you can't walk in and take that away from me, you're cutting off my air. I never killed anybody! - You manipulated Union funds, Harry. You broke the law, and what's worse, you got caught! - Yeah. - You brought this all on yourself. - Yeah, well, I'll finish it myself. No conditions! Tomorrow I announce my hunger strike. Nothing but water and bicarb, just like Gandhi. - Sorry you feel that way about it, Harry. Because they're not gonna let you do that. - They're not gonna let me do it, they can't stop me! You know this place is gonna be swarming with the press, people you can't buy, Jack Anderson, Mike Wallace! - Nathuram Godse. - Who? - He was the fanatic who assassinated Gandhi. - Oh, yeah. - Just like some nuts gonna whack you, Harry. - They wouldn't risk it. - They'll make it look like a prison fight, some religious nut who's gonna be upset with you wearing your sheet and making a mockery of Gandhi. They'll take a shank that he made out of a spoon. He'll come up to you in the yard and he'll take that shank and he'll slip it right into your heart. It will look like a religious thing, do you understand? Not political at all. - Come on, you're bluffing. - Harry, you were my teacher, you taught me never to bluff, now take the deal! I know it sucks but it's the only one you've got. Now, later on, if you wanna double cross Frankie and the President, that's your business, but if you get shanked in that yard, and believe me, you will, it's all over! - They wouldn't dare, you know why? Killing me ain't enough, my boys wouldn't let my spirit die. And if I'm dead, it's tough on the President, he's got nobody to deal with. - Harry, you're not Joe Hill, you're Harry Kruger. You've been a one man show all your life and if you die, all that show is over. You owe it to your dreams to stay alive, Harry! (soft piano music) - You son of a bitch. (mumbles) - I'll tell you something else, that condition that you're gonna sign is not constitutional. You'll be able to bust it in court in a year. It just so happens that I have another copy of the agreement. Sign it. (solemn piano music) I'm saving your life, Harry. - Hey, you're some piece of machinery. - You bet I am. Don't you see, Harry, I make it all work. While you and Boda, and the President march up and down your stage, play your little games, stroke yourself in public, shout and stamp your feet and call your press conferences, and count to see how many times you get your names in the papers, I do the work, Harry! I put it all together, I read the fine print, I check the precedence, I even eat crap if I have to because if I didn't, you heroes would flush this country down the toilet. - Why do you do it? - I love the action. Sign it. I got a plane to catch. (exciting lighthearted music) ♫ There's people out there - (mumbles) really something. Knock you out when you contemplate the opportunities. You know who I am? What am I, after all? I'm a skinny kid from south Philly who's had a few breaks. Here, now, tonight, I'm gonna sit down as a equal and break bread with prime ministers and ambassadors and sheikhs. - Yeah, good company you keep. I heard about that sheik, you know his bodyguards, they invented this device, it goes right from a transistor radio right to your organs. When they turn the volume up, you rat on your mother. - You're just jealous, Mickey, you want everybody to eat with you at Burger King. - You know, you're becoming a real social climber. You aware of that, Frankie? - If you can talk to crowds and keep your virtue, or walk with kings to lose the common touch. - Listen, I'm the first Vice President of organizers, why don't you save that flowery crap for the first Vice President of Public Relations? And what the hell you'd get me up here for? To help you get dressed, or do you need something organized? - Both, I'm trying to improve your image and I need your help to improve mine. - What's up Frankie, you worried about Kruger? - Of course I am, he's gonna be on our back in another month, and for the pleasure of his company, we're being held up by Washington for two million bucks. - You didn't really go for a deal like that, did you? - I had to, I had no choice! Son of a bitch, I hate to be ripped off like that. That's gonna get around to, you know what that's gonna do to our image. - Only if you lie down and take it. - Yeah, you're so right, that's why I wanna see you. I want you to figure out some sort of scenario that will bail us out of being blackjack. - All right, first you gotta tell me, how's the money supposed to be paid? - I gotta pay them in the money, in cash, 10 days after they spring Kruger. And the President's new bag man is our very own lawyer, Don Tucker. - In Washington, that's tough. - Mmm hmm, right here in New York City. I like to keep the home court advantage. - All right, so you're figuring maybe we tie a little string on the package. - Keep talking. - If all you promised was to deliver the cash, then some unscrupulous bastard could conceivably steal it from Tucker after you make the delivery, after you fulfill your part of the bargain. - That's right, if they can't hold onto their wallets, if they're careless, that's not our problem. Could you actually see something like that happening, Mickey? - Is an elephant heavy? - The President's Reelection Committee keeps a suite at the hotel Savoy. If Tucker stays there, he has to spend the night in New York, but he's gonna be pretty secure there. - Not necessarily, somebody good could make the snatch there. An out of towner, maybe somebody who's been inactive for a while, it could be a clean job. - Cleaner than clean, Mickey. It can be no tracks, and whoever does this job has gotta be his last one, forever, because we can't have a guy like that walking around, now can we. - It seems like a waste of talent. - And another thing, the cash, it's all ready been accounted for. I took it out of special allocations, and I can't very well put it back. - That's a shame. - I really want this thing to go right, because I'm sick and tired of seeing the elected officials of this country betray their sacred trust. They've got to understand they are servants of the people, not their own greed. - And we're the people, right, Frankie? - Right, right, Mickey, now you get it. (mumbles) - There is! - Show it! - There is! - Show it! - (mumbles) I would. (mumbles) - Well aimed, such a young one. - Well, by St George, I am too young for you. - Yet you are willing. (mumbles) - I cannot. (people laughing) I'll chafe you if I can't, let me go! (people cheering) - You might wanna get that nose off of you so you can use it again, sit down. - How bad were we? I mean, you're not gonna pull extra rehearsals on us again, are you, Coach? Ouch! - No extra rehearsals. Listen folks, I got a plan, a very serious plan, a plan for our future. Look, I don't mean to be abrupt, it's time for me to give you my notice. I'm gonna leave the company, for a while anyway, so you might as well leave me out of your plans. - You're joking, you can't be serious. - I am serious. I would never be flip with you. - How long have you been thinking about this? - Something that came up a couple of days ago. - And how long do you plan to be gone? - I don't know, you should find somebody to replace me, even on a permanent basis. - Julian, are you all right? - I'm okay. - You get a big job someplace there, Julie? - That's right, Ron, a really big job. - Can they use us, too? - No, this is a job for experienced professionals. - Professional, the foundation pays us to do these plays, doesn't that make us professional - Wait a minute, wait a minute, Julie-- - Shut up, Dixie. Don't lie to me, Julian, we've been together for two years, I can't stay married that long. Now, you wouldn't walk out on us unless a guy had a gun to your head or a bag of money in his hand. - I spent time in jail for burglary. Shortly before we organized this group, I was involved in the jail break. I don't wanna go back there, I just can't take it. People that helped me escape are very serious people. - My god, that's incredible. - Knock it off, Dixie. They let you off the hook for one job? - If they blackmail you once, they can blackmail you again. - Maybe they're bluffing. What's in it for them if they lock you up? - Ron, they could trade me for a favor for the DA, one of their people would get a reduced sentence in exchange for me. - Well, what are you gonna do then? - What I have to do. Look, you were great, you were wonderful, you've been doing outstanding work for months, you might as well get somebody else! - Damn it, Julie, I don't wanna give us up. - Besides, you need us. - How so? - We're different, the four of us, you know what I mean. - Yeah, I know. - All right, that's it, I'm going with you, you need somebody to back you up, somebody who's gonna be with you all the way. - [Julian] You're not robbers and you're not criminals. - We weren't actors either before you taught us. - It's the first time you've heard about this, I think it's great that you wanna help, but you'd flop in this way, and not just get bad reviews! - Julie, like I always say, one for all and all for one. - Julie, you've got a gang. - No, Ron, I got a family. (exciting fast music) (people cheering) - It is good news this Christmas Eve for Harry Kruger. He was released from prison today after more than three years behind bars. - They're playing Hail to the Chief, that's my song. - He was one of this country's most powerful labor leaders, and tonight, he's free with some strings attached. - Relax, boss, they're gonna play for that little song. - [News Reporter] The President pardoned Kruger after he agreed to give up union activities for 10 years. - Two million bucks for that song. - It's a bargain. - The action was not without political criticism. (mumbles) Among those of the prison gates to greet Kruger was Frankie Boda, the Union's present leader. (people cheering) ("Hail to the Chief") (loud knocking) - Ah, Frankie, you're a (mumbles). Who is it? - [Julian] Julian. - You've been to the hotel? - Yes. - Well? - It's doable. - What's that? - That's for the money. - Why that? - Because 50 40,000 stacks will fit exactly in that case, and that case will fit in the safe at the Savoy. - Nice and precise, your reputation isn't bullshit. - You got something for me? - Sure, I do. (mumbles) The final payment on delivery. Tell me one thing. - What's that? - A couple of my guys gotta come in there with you. - No, no way, just my own people. - One guy, just one. - We work alone or we don't work. You don't let me do this job on my own, with my own people, you can take your job and stuff it. - A couple of my guys rolling along with you can help. - Why, what are their specialties? Safe cracking or head breaking? I don't need any muscle men messing up my job. - Listen, don't get on your fucking high horse with me. You know, you don't do this job my way, you know what the consequences are. - Look, you want this job done on a specific date, you don't have time to replace me. Now, what about the delivery? - Oh, let me worry about that. - I don't want any of your people hanging around outside waiting for us to finish up, because at that time in the morning, the streets are empty and any personal vehicle hanging around is going to attract attention, and attention means the police, and that means trouble. So, just tell me where and when to deliver the money and don't interfere with my operation. - Wait a minute, you mean you want me to take your word of honor that you're gonna show up with the money? - It took the police three years and they still haven't found me, it took your people three days. - Yeah, well, they didn't need you as bad as I do. - So, they don't know where to find me, but you do. So, no (mumbles) is waiting outside while the gig is going down. - All right, we'll work it out. Listen, I thought you'd like to know, you were set up for that fall you took. - Wow, you know a lot about me, don't you? - I wanted one of the best so I checked you out. - Ugly bugger, isn't he? Anything else? - No, that's it for now. So, listen, where and when can I reach you between now and then? - Don't worry, I'll ring you. - Merry Christmas, (mumbles). (soft upbeat music) - [Woman] I'm always amused by this ritual you go through with the President's portraits. - I know it's funny, but even his presence in a picture makes me feel like I'm having fun at his expense. - I can't tell you how happy I was when you called me, I didn't expect to hear from you again for weeks. - You know I'd never turn down a chance to come to New York. - Oh, I know, I know you try, but I miss you. - I miss you, too. - Sometimes I wonder. - How can you say that? I'm here, right? - You had business in New York. - I don't have to stay over, I stay over because I wanna be with you. - Sometimes I think you could try harder, you could come to New York more. I'd certainly go to Washington once a week if you wanted me to. - We've been over this hundred times, Washington is like living in a fish bowl. When I walk my dog, my wife gets 10 reports on where it stops to pee. (woman laughing) - Oh, Donnie. - It's true, just the other day I was walking Rex through the rose garden and-- - Rex? You didn't tell me your dog was named Rex. - My son named him, his real name is Oedipus Rex, we just call him Rex for short. - Oh my, the President wouldn't like that all, would he? He'd have a fit. - I don't know, he says he believes in (mumbles). (woman giggling) - I know a Donnie Tucker that nobody else in the world knows. (phone ringing) (mumbles) that call. - So, do I. Yeah? No, I'll come down. Listen, order dinner, I'll be back in a few minutes. - What would you like? - Surprise me. - You know I'll surprise you. - Yeah. - Don, happy new year. - Same to you, Frankie. Glad to find you in such a good mood. - Said a few things last time I shouldn't have. But what the hell, we all do what we have to do. New year, fresh start. - I'm glad you feel that way about it. Is this our contribution? - Yeah, uh huh. Let me give you some mind, let you see what you're gonna get. Well, that looks kind of harmless laying there like that, doesn't it? (man laughing) It's all yours. Don't spend it in one place. Sorry I had to make you layover like this. - Oh, no problem. - All right, let me get you a couple tickets to a show, arrange for a little nooky. (man laughing) - No, no, I'm gonna sack out early tonight, get a good start in the morning. Thanks anyway, Frankie. - Don, have a good flight. - Thank you. (loud piano music) (fast rhythmic music) Uh, excuse me. - Good evening, Mr. Tucker. - Would this fit into your vault? - Sure. - Would I be able to get to it at anytime, just in case? - We've got security on call 24 hours a day. - Would you just go check for me, make sure it fits in there? Please, it's very important. Thanks. - Plenty of room, couldn't be safer. Would you sign right there? - Are you sure it's gonna be okay in there, huh? - It's safer than safe. - Great. - Here's your copy. - Thanks. Hey listen, one more thing, hold all my calls, okay? - Sure, you bet, Mr. Tucker. - So this is the stuff that dreams are made of? - Let me see. No, this is the stuff that pasties made of. - Then why did they bother to put it in the safe? - In case of a robbery, they claim a loss on the real ones. - So, what do they do with the real ones? - The real ones they sold to the French years ago. - Oh, you can't trust anybody anymore. You almost finished? - It's hard to tell. You getting antsy? - Yeah, I guess so. - Don't worry, we're gonna make it. (woman groaning) What's that? - Oh, it's that hooker. - Better take a look. You pack up the letters and address books. (woman screaming) You got a problem? - I gotta go to the bathroom real bad. - Look, we're almost finished up here, you can hold it, okay? - Oh, have a heart, I'm dying. I took a dieretic for my water retention, you know, and I'm gonna burst. - Dixie, I need you. - Somebody's out there, I know it, I can feel it. A little while ago when I was-- - I got something for you to do, come on. - Will you listen to me, please, a truck passed and one of the high beams caught a glint of something like binoculars from a window, about eight stories up, and those curtains, they keep going back and forth, and back and forth-- - Too many westerns, Dixie, you've been watching too many westerns. (mumbles) was always sun gleaming off the barrel of a gun. Come on, don't worry, cops never attack before dawn, they're afraid their souls won't get on the pad. - Turn around. - No, I'm supposed to be watching you. - Oh, please, two seconds, just give me two seconds to get started! (man sighing) - That is all you get, two seconds. - Don't look! - I'm not, come on, hurry up, go. - What the hell you got there. (woman screaming) - Okay, loverboy, on your feet, slow and easy. - Son of a bitch. (exciting intense music) Which one will catch you butterfly? (mumbles) - Get out! (people screaming) - I'm (mumbles) one, two, one, two. And at the chorus end, I hit. - Maybe we can make a deal. - What do you want? - That guy, our recent check in? - Yeah. - He needs to talk to us. - What's on his mind? - We'll find out in a minute. - Bring him into the lobby. (intriguing rhythmic music) - What is your problem? - Okay, what's this all about. - You're making a big mistake. We all work for the government, we're not here to rip you off. There's a top official in the hotel. The car that's supposed to be guarding him disappeared. The hotel is surrounded, folks. - No sale, it isn't true. - It is, look, we don't know who those people are, they must be gunmen. We came in undercover, check it out. - What's the name of this top official staying at the hotel? - Can't tell you that. - Put him back in the office. - Wait, wait a minute, look, if he don't call a contact number in five minutes, they'll call him. You know, if this man's beeper goes off, and when he calls in, when our people know he's safe, they're gonna come at you like the seventh calvary, shooting, buddy. - Okay, let's wrap it up, we don't have much time. - Are we finished? - There are people who may think so. Come on. (soft relaxing music) - It feels so good. So good. You know, it's the only time I ever relax. Really relax, is when you... It's the only time I don't ever think about anything. I don't think about Boda, I don't think about the President, I don't think about Kruger. You know, they're all the same. Greedy, ambitious, selfish, egotistical, paranoid. You know when it rains, they think it's a master plot to get them wet. Ooh, yes, yes, yes. Oh, I'm not gonna think about them tonight. (mumbles) them all. Did you ever hear that expression? It means fuck them all. Yeah, yeah, bless them all, bless them all. Bless them all. (beeper beeping) Holy shit. - What's that? - My beeper. - Your what? - It's my beeper, I got answer it, it's the President calling. - Stay right where you are, I'm killing myself trying to get you off. It's bad enough you're talking business all the time, you think I'm let you start trying (mumbles) business. It's bad enough I have to start all over again from nothing. - [Man] Come in (mumbles). - [Woman] I read you. - Act two. - Okay. (exciting rock music) (woman grunting) - All stations to all stations, prepare for this (mumbles). (intense rock music) - Listen up! I've just placed an explosive device in this room, which I can detonate by radio signal. Don't let me hear any suspicious sounds for the next 15 minutes while we're driving away. I don't wanna hear anything that will indicate that you're trying to get loose and call the cops. Just 15 more minutes, folks, and nobody gets hurt. Goodnight! (fast rhythmic music) - [Man On Radio] Station one and two, ready when you are. (phone trilling) (phone ringing) - Ron, you ready? - [Ron] Yeah, yeah. - Once more, (mumbles) once more. - [Both] Shut up, Dixie. - Come on, let's go. (exciting rock music) - [Man] All cars (mumbles) reaching the robbery of (mumbles) Savoy Hotel, repeat (mumbles). (sirens ringing) - All units return to base. All units haul ass, let's get the hell out of here. (intense fast music) (sirens ringing) - Darling, am I ever glad to see you? - [Woman] How do you feel? - It's hard to express. - Well, in that case, come back to bed. (man giggling) - Well, I really shouldn't, I've got an early flight to catch, I've got something special for the President. - Why don't you give it to me instead? - There's very tight security in the basement and the employees area. Julian, I want you to leave these maids a big tip. They're terribly exploited by this hotel. Okay, hold the top. - Hey, what's in this case? - It's the only loot we're taking out of the hotel? - Come on, you mean we're not taking all these jewels? - I told you, you're not robbers, I'm not gonna make you robbers. - What are you saying, Julian, that we're not gonna go through with this now? - Look, the only thing we want is right here in this case, and the only people who know about its existence are a handful of men who will vehemently deny any connection to it. Besides, this is gonna make our work worthwhile. If we give the rest of the loot back, the cops won't care because nothing will be missing. Dixie, you know the laundry chute three doors down? - Yeah. - Take the stuff and drop it off, will you please? - Julie, there are chamber maids constantly going back to that chute. - I know, we got enough time, don't worry. - Okay. - This is room 554, send a bellman up and have the door ready. See you guys downstairs. - Yeah. - Hey, remember, this is the last deck. - Wait a minute, wait, Dixie, wait. - Oh. - Get outta here, Grandma! - Ooh. (exciting energetic music) (many people talking) (mumbles) - Platinum setting? - Platinum setting (mumbles), I had diamond earrings, (mumbles) I had pearl earrings and I had a broach. - Do you care if we photograph the cashier's office? - No, absolutely no, Gabe. Nobody gets near that cashiers desk until after the detectives. (many people talking) - I just don't have any information myself. - What am I supposed to do about all my diamonds? - Sometime before 4:00-- - Hold on, I gotta change the cassette. - Can you give me a statement? (people talking) - Sometime before 4:00 am this morning, three male Caucasians entered the hotel premises, handcuffed nine employees and two perspective guests, and forcibly opened about 50 safety deposit boxes and the main safe. About two hours later, they made their escape in a gray limousine which was driven by a fourth male Caucasian. These were not equal opportunity employers. (intense rock music) - Can you estimate the loss (mumbles). - That will take weeks, maybe months. - How about a guest (mumbles). - Well, it's a shot in the dark, but based on other cases like this, they could've gotten one, maybe two million in jewels, cash, and (mumbles). (exciting rock music) Use your brain, anybody who brings along 24 pairs of handcuffs and three (mumbles) and gets in and out without firing a shot or bumping a head is all (mumbles), as far as I'm concerned. Now, what was your other dumb question? (intense rock music) - Did you see anybody suspicious at all? - Lady, in New York, everybody's suspicious. (people talking loudly) - [Man] I don't know what's going on! - Hey, I gotta see the chief. (mumbles) Just tell him that Mickey wants to see him. - Mickey who? - Listen, you want (mumbles), otherwise how's he gonna (mumbles) all the way to the Bronx. (exciting rock music) - Still don't understand what you two people were doing here, this is a New York Police operation. Officer Moore, take these people downtown. - Yeah, yes, Sir. - So long, Chief. (mumbles) - Thanks. So, what do you have? - Those spooks are the only ones who talked to the perpetrators. I got a good look at them just before they left, who the hell are they anyway? - Officer Milatzi, it is none of your damn business. - They didn't give us a statement, nothing. I think you should book them as material witnesses. - I turned them loose. - Why? - Because I talked to the Commissioner and he said to turn them loose, and thank them on the way out, so I did. - I'd let them kiss my ass. - Yeah, and you'll do it in uniform too. - They're the best we had. - God damn feds are all the same, they stink. - Yeah, tell me about it. (many people talking) - Everything is going absolutely fine. - Chief, Mickey Bints here. - I'll call you back, sir, yes. Well, Micken Bint, what are you doing here? This ain't your turf. (phone ringing) Yes? No, I've all ready released them, thank you, it's okay. - Relax, Howard, you're gonna need all the help you can get. - So, give me some. I got a hotel robbery, I got two federal spooks who are the victims. Now the labor union big shot shows up. You wanna tell me what's going on here? - We wanna help, what are you gonna do? Look and get through us in their mouth? I'll spread the word to my people, tell me what you're looking for. - Sir. - Tell Castello to handle it. - Yes, Sir. - I'm looking for four male Caucasians. - That's it? - That's it, I'm looking for information from the street, somebody who saw them leave. - Good luck. - Mickey, come on, what do you know? - I can tell you positively nobody saw them leave. Did you release any of the other witnesses yet? - Yeah, the couple I just released, he said they saw them and talked to them. - Oh, geez, listen, I'm sorry, I'm late. I forgot, I left this guy in the lobby and I was supposed to meet him. - Mickey! - I'll come back, all right, Chief? (exciting intense music) Hey (mumbles). Come here, what'd you think, you were gonna sneak out, just like that? - I beg your pardon. (mumbles) - Hey, Sergeant, wanna keep those stripes, take a walk. - You're obstructing justice. - How the hell could you let them go? - They're not the ones. - Oh, Jesus, excuse me, I'm sorry. - Captain, would you see that these people get out of here? - I apologize. (people talking loudly) - Don't do me any favors. Besides, the people you were looking for were the feds. - Chief, we need you in the office right away. - That's our car, right over there. Darling, I'll never stay in this hotel again. (powerful rock music) - Sure, no problem. Yes, thank you. - You buy that story? - Sounds like we recovered the whole take, doesn't it? - Is that what you want me to tell the press? - No, no, I think we should tell them that we're not 100% sure yet, it's gonna take a little while to check out what's been recovered against the claims. - What the hell would make those guys leave all that stuff behind? - Pete, just tell them it was one big prank. Some playboys come in here, they wanna prove they're real macho, tuxedos, limousines, they wanna pull off a big job, make a clean getaway, probably coked up to their ears. - Howie, you don't really believe all that crap, do you? - It beats leaving this case open on the books. Now get out of here. - [Mickey] Just getting up? - [Frankie] No, I heard the news this morning, I decided to celebrate, I went back to bed. - How could you sleep at a time like this? - Who said anything about sleeping, Mickey? - Well, I'm glad I didn't disturb you earlier. - (mumbles) I'm glad you didn't too. (people laughing) Bye, baby. Here, take your coffee. Where's your suitcase? - I don't know. - You don't know? Want some coffee? - Did you hear me, Frankie? - Yeah, yeah, I heard you, Mick. And I really think you better have a cup of coffee. Here. - You know, you can't trust anybody anymore, Frankie. I mean, there's no values, no word of honor, nothing counts, you know. - So it seems. How did you lose control? - Everything got out of control. I mean, I think even the guys that were doing the job lost control. - Come on, Mick, you don't believe that crap. - I don't know what to believe anymore. - Neither do I. - You know, Frankie, there were FBI guys outside, staking it, and we had to go outside and snatch them, and it's gonna be all hell to pay and you're gonna have to deal with the Bureau yourself. - Yeah, I gotta put up with all this crap, I don't get any money either. - All I know is everything was going down as smooth as glass, and then all of a sudden, before I knew it, there were cops coming from every direction. I still don't know who tipped them off. - The guys you sent in were the safecrackers, what do they tell you happened? - Well, there never were any of my guys along with them because they didn't want any outsiders interfering. - Jesus Christ, you're a dummy! I was beginning to suspect that maybe you had something to do with this missing money, but hell, that would take brains and you got none! You look at me like you expect to replace me someday. Jesus, what a joke that is! - I'm gonna get this fucking creep that I got to do the job. - Yeah, get him. The only thing he's gonna do now is cause us trouble, (mumbles) Tucker, he smells something. I thought he went for that layover too easy. The other President did this to me, that slimy faggot. I'm gonna snap that son of a bitch like a scallion, I made him, Mickey, and I'm gonna break him. (solemn piano music) - Yeah, how? - I don't know, he's gotta slip up. Sooner or later, he's gonna have to slip up because he's a loser. Now, when he does, when he makes his one mistake, I'm gonna be on him, I'm gonna be a god damned monkey on his back, he's never gonna get rid of me. I'm gonna use the newspapers, the Congress, the networks, I'm gonna run that son of a bitch out of the White House. That silly shit is gonna crawl out of Washington on his hands and knees. (deep dramatic music) - I guess you've all ready heard about the robbery at the hotel last night, Sir. - That hotel is the biggest cheaters joint in New York. Can you imagine all those Scarsdale jerks humping away upstairs while somebody downstairs was ripping them off. (man laughing) Those jerks. When I started working in New York, I used to take contracts over to the Savoy Hotel to get them signed, I'd watch those jackasses pretend to be the contract. They couldn't understand them. Their brains were mud from too much humping, I could get them to sign anything. How'd it go? Did Boda come through on schedule? - He kept his end of the bargain, Sir, yes. - Damn well better if he knows what's good for him. Don, what are we gonna do about Kruger? Can't we shut him up? He's been out now, what, 10 days, he's all ready giving interviews on penal reform. - The restriction he signed concerns only Union activities, Sir. - Well, we know what that means, he's keeping himself in the public eye. I'm getting sick of Kruger. Take a look at the fine print, maybe there's someway we can put a lid on him. - Yes, Sir. - Boda didn't give you any trouble, did he? - No, Sir. - What did Corky have to say? - I didn't see him, Sir. - You were supposed to deliver the money to Corky, right? - Yes, Sir. - Don't tell me that lard head has snuck off again to Palm Beach? I don't know what I'm gonna do with him. Get me Corky. - I was at the Savoy Hotel last night, Sir. - Yeah, in the Reelection Committee Suite. (man laughing) Not you too? Oh, Don, taste a little piece of the strange, eh? Wait until I tell Corky. He always thought you were a little (mumbles). - By the time I got the money last night, it was too late to make the last shuttle flight to Washington, Sir. - The money-- - Was in the vault at the hotel. - They got it? - They got it. - But the police... No, the news said everything was recovered, all the jewels, everything. - Everything they think is missing. Everything except your money. I wasn't in a position to file a claim, Sir. - They set you up, Don, I know it. Those sons of bitches set you up and they're back in New York laughing their asses off at me, at the President of the United States! Wow, wow, wow. Well, let them have their little laugh, let them think they beat me, but I've got four more years in this chair, four more years, and we'll see who has the last laugh. As for Kruger, he's the one that started all of this, we're going to put that (mumbles) where he belongs. You get that, Don! We'll see who laughs last. And you, Don! How did you let them do this to me? What were you doing? Where the hell were you when I was getting screwed?
