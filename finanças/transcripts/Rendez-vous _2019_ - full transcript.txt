Hey, are you close? You ok? heyyyy grl, how's it going!?? no show :[ WHAAAAT?! It's been 35 minutes. He's not coming. Well fck. I know. Fckkkk. Well you could wait a bit. for what? the city's a mess. he's probably just l8. he hasn't even texted his battery died? R U HIS MOTHER? LOOOL Lili? Hey! Sorry, I was -- He's HERE. Don't wait up. Bishhh So? I was just about to leave. Shit. My bad. It's just you won't believe it. Try me. I got mugged. What? Yeah. I was on my way from work and two guys took out a gun. They told me to hand over my phone and wallet. Y'know, the city. Are you ok? Yes. I just didn't have a way to text you. I'm sorry. No, I am. Now I can't pay for the museum, but if you want we can take a walk. Pay? What century is this? You think I'm one of those girls who wants everything to be paid for. Nah, it's on me. I feel bad that you had to come all this way after what happened. This way you can forget about it and then we'll see what we can do. Ok. Are you always like this? Like what? I don't know. Improvising. I guess so. I'd never thought about it. What are you like? To be honest, I don't like improvising. I'm more of a planner. Today, let's let go. See what happens. Hello. Two tickets, please. Here you are. Thank you. - Here you go. - Thank you. Have you been here before? Yep, I'd like to come more often though. That's weird. You didn't have any profile pictures here. And it's a nice place. You saw my Facebook? Um, no-- I mean I didn't want to sound like a stalker. Don't worry. It's just you don't have a picture here. Doesn't bother me. Really? I'm flattered, actually. What about you? Did you see my pictures? You're not going to tell me? Well. I'm not sure. I think that's just a story you made up. But I honestly don't think that was the artist's intention. I dunno. It could be. But don't you think that painting was a bit... I mean yeah, I guess. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Art's like that. We all give our own interpretation, right? The artist creates the work. And we give it meaning. What it makes us feel. We all give our own interpretation? Wow. What? No, nothing. I mean, I didn't think you were like that. Do you mean... smart? What? No, no. I'm sorry I mean, so deep. How did you think I was? I don't know. I hadn't thought about it. And now what do you think? I think that... ...its getting late. And you probably want to go home. That depends. What's on your mind? I'd like to... keep talking. Get to know you more. I accept. I'll tell you what. Since you paid for the museum... ...I'll cook dinner for you. Interesting. Hmm. Your talents are showing. So, you're a chef and a stalker. What else can you do? I shouldn't have mentioned the Facebook thing. - Are you blushing? - Tell me. About what? About yourself. I don't know. Whatever you want. What would you like to know? Hmm, for starters... What do you do for a living? Where are you from? What's your favorite smell? What music do you like? What makes you happy? What bothers you? And most importantly... Do you want... Do you want to have a partner for the rest of your life? Uh... I don't know. Let's see. Ask me everything again. One by one. What do you do for a living? I search. Where are you from? Here... there. I don't know anymore. What's your favorite smell? - Spell? - Smell! Smell? Yes. Haven't you thought of it? No. Well, think about it. I don't know. Coffee maybe? Yeah, the smell of morning coffee. Yes. It smells nice. What music do you like? Queen. Hmm! Another one smells like balls. Another one smells like balls. Owww! Bravo! Thank you. Ooooh! What makes you happy? Sleeping. Sleeping a lot. And... A woman who can make fun of herself. I also like movies. A romantic dinner. Red wine. What bothers you? Green olives. And... Do you want to have a partner for the rest of your life? Ask me that later. Do you online date a lot? No, to be honest I barely date. But I don't know, I saw your profile and took a chance. What about you? Well, I'm not gonna lie. Oh, thanks. Oh and this should be very clear. For me, honesty is the basis of every relationship. Agreed. Well, yeah. I've gone out with a few people. Even girls. You know, when nothing works, just switch. - - Okay! Surprised? No, no. You imagined it, didn't you! Perv! No. Anyway. Here I am. Single and going to a cute guy's apartment. Unless you want to end the date after my confession. I don't know. I guess I'll have to think about it. I'm kidding. - Stupid! - But I have to confess something too. The stage is yours. Thank you. You have to beat my best date ever. Who is she? Sandra Rodriguez. When I was 12 I had the perfect date. Tell me more about my rival. I asked my parents for some money, and took her out. Right. You like to pay for everything. Oh come on. I was a kid. I didn't have a job or anything. True. And where did you go? I took her to McDonald's. Then to the movies. And then we went to a mall. Ambitious! Well, at the mall there was this new ice-skating rink. I thought it was like Rockefeller Center, I bet it was way smaller though. And you fell down. Nah. Quite the opposite. I gave her my hand so she wouldn't fall. She held it tight. And she didn't let go for like 15 minutes. Oh! I don't know. Like we would have gone there just to be together, not just skate. Oh! Did you kiss? Good afternoon. Are you familiar with the tradition of the "lucky canary"? No. It's an old Mexican tradition. With your name, the canary draws a lucky fortune especially for you. What's your name? Lili. Have you done it before? How much? Five pesos. Now look, how the little bird will draw your luck. Ok. It's for Lili. Draw a nice good luck fortune. That's it. A nice message for you. Thank you. What's its name? - Panchito. - Panchito. Thanks, Panchito. - Good luck! - Thank you mister. - Let's see. - No, no. It's bad luck to share a fortune. Well then, did you get to 1st base or not? First base... Well yeah, it was my first kiss. How was it? Her mom called her from the other side of the rink. And Sandra turned to me. We locked eyes for an eternity. Then she came up close. She sang something. She sang... I can't remember. And then she kissed me. She kissed me. And then what happened? Did you start going out? No. No. That weekend we found out her Dad had embezzled millions from a State-owned company. They fled from the country and I never see her again. Whoa. Yeah. Sorry about that. Although I'm actually happy. - - Why? I mean, maybe if her dad wasn't a thief they wouldn't have had to flee, And maybe you'd still be with Sandra, And we wouldn't have met. Well I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not. I think we were meant to meet each other. Meant to? Well, however you want to call it. - What? - Fate. No, I don't believe in fate. - No? - No. No, I think one has to make their own decisions. Of course, but... I do think there are some things that.. The universe or whatever you wanna call it gives them to you as an experience. Right? But if you don't do anything they won't happen. Sure, but don't you think there are people you're meant to cross paths with? I suppose so. If you don't make those moments happen... I don't know. Yeah. I think everyone is master of their own fate. No magic helping you. And if you mess up, or do good it's up to you. So, you need to plan everything? Yes, I do plan everything. Hey there! How are you? You look familiar. Are you actors? I don't mean to brag, but I am. Really? Yes, I am. I'm actually in this pilot called "Buy cupcakes from the cute girl - with the pink hair." - Just kidding. No really, I am selling these cupcakes, maybe you can help me out with one? They're really good! What flavor are they? I have coke, mushrooms, pot, and LSD. You know what? Drugs are bad. But they're vegan! We are FBI officers. Just kidding. I used soy milk and fruit flavors. Sorry, we're on a diet. No one can say no to dessert. Do you want one? And I see you all lovey-dovey. C'mon, a cupcake for the sweethearts? Not this time, thank you. Thank you, anyway. Good luck! We just cross here and we're there. Great. Have you been here before? Nope. Not around here. I like it. That's typical from here, uh? Yeah. Sounds nice, isn't it? Hello. Good evening. Is there anyone I'm competing against? To be honest I can't remember a date like yours. But you don't have a first love? No. No? Well there was one... No. Better if I don't tell you. Oh no, now you have to. Well it's not really a first love. But when I was 15 o 16 years old. Sounds like a first love. No dummy. Wait. It was just a neighbor that lived in my building and I like him a lot. Did he go to your school? No, no, no. He was 35 years old. Ah, okay. And all my friends had lost their virginity. I hadn't. And I was rushing to grow up. So, he was your first time. No, no. No, but I would have, I really liked him. I think he liked me too. He never did anything, but... You know when you like someone and you know they like you too? Yeah. Me too. Sometimes I would wait for him to walk his dog. And I would make up I had to get something at the store just to talk. My friends were sleeping with boys and I was dreaming of a man. Sounds like you were a lolita. I guess. And well, we exchanged numbers and texted. Everyday I felt closer to him, I guess he felt the same way. Don't be stupid. They were very innocent messages. He never texted first and never made any kind of suggestion. But "thanks" to a friend from school. My family knew that I was talking with a 35-year-old man. First, they asked him why he was talking with a teenager. Then the whole neighborhood found out. That's when the threats started. Graffiti on his door. Kids insulted him. They even keyed his car. So, he left. And that's as close as I've gotten to a first love. And as you can tell, I was never even with him. Sounds complicated. Yeah. Well it's never too late to start right? What? We're here. It's big. I guess that Sandra and... Rodrigo. And Rodrigo, have good opponents today huh? Don't worry. I'll do my best. Sorry, but I've been robbed here to, is it ok? No worries. I thought this was a quiet area. I did too. Come in. Thank you. Wow! Your home is lovely. Voilá. Want something to drink? Well you said you liked red wine. I'm no expert but I'd try one of your favorites. Perfect. Then I'll go to the kitchen and see what I can get you. I'll be right back. Let me spoil you. I could definitely marry you. Did you say something? I said I could definitely have two. Of course, it's very delicious. Wine has many qualities, some, if drunk moderately, increases life expectancy. Unless a car hits you or you're murdered. I suppose it's a possibility. This is a Ribera del Duero. You really want to impress me, huh? Tell me more. I've seen people swirl the glasses like this. That's to measure the alcohol level. Isn't that on the bottle? Yeah but come on. I'm joking. I love how you turn red. You can tilt your glass like this. Or swirl it like you were doing it. And however long the drip takes to return, the liquid. Uh-huh. Is the level of alcohol. The more alcohol, the more it takes to drip down. Looks like this one doesn't have much. The drip returns fast. Well then, cheers! No, no. Wait a little bit. You still need to smell it. You have to take it in, deeply. Breath deep. Tell me what you smell. Citrics? Yes. Very good. It has orange. Some wood notes. Sorry, I'm being snobby, aren't I? - No. - No. I like learning new things. To learning new things? - Cheers. - Cheers. It's really nice. I'm no expert, but It's really nice. Cool. I'm happy you did. Now, I'll be right back. Make yourself at home. Are you just drinking that? What? You haven't touched your wine. Here. I don't have cooties. Plus we already kissed. What's mine is yours and what's yours is mine. Or are you trying to get me drunk and take advantage? No. Well then, it's your turn to toast. To cooties. - Right. - - Cheers. - Cheers. Ok now I really will start cooking. And let me spoil you. Is there something you don't like to eat? I don't eat meat. I'm sorry. You're vegetarian? Yeah. That's weird, it didn't say on your profile. Of course, it does. No, really. Yes. Here it says that I'm... Shit. My bad. You're right. Vegetarian or vegan? Vegetarian. I haven't made the decision. Oh ok, I'll whip something up. Perfect, I'll sit here with the wine. What's the big deal? Do you like to read? Yes. You have a lot of books. But it seems you want to be some kind of Sherlock Holmes. Everything is crime novel. I like mystery a lot, it intrigues me. Do you like to read? Well, I don't think of myself as a bookworm but I do read. What was the last thing that you read? Fight Club 2by Chuck Palahniuk, Do you know it? Oh yeah, I saw the movie, from the first book I'm guessing. Yup. That one. I love his writing. You can lend it to me later. Of course. Dinner is almost ready, and I have to say this is the best night of my life. What's this, Eduardo? Is this your phone? Yes. But you said you were mugged and that's why you were late. I know. I'm sorry. Are you going to tell me the truth then? Stop acting like a child and tell me what happened. I'm embarrassed to admit it. I overslept. What? I'm really sorry. I thought... I came back from work and I thought I'd have time for a nap but... I'm sorry. You're kidding, right? No, really, I thought I'd set the alarm but it didn't sound. Sorry. You should have sent me a text. No. I was afraid if I said I'd overslept you would have told to f-- No, no, no. Think about it. Now, you've met me but... If someone arrives late for half an hour and on top says "sorry, I overslept." What would you have done? I'd think he didn't give a shit about the date. So? So, you probably wouldn't have even replied. That's for sure. So you thought it was better to lie, and that I wouldn't find out? I told you, honesty is very important to- To be honest, I really like you. It's been a long time since I've felt like this. I feel happy to talk to someone again. Text each other. It's nice. And when I saw you there waiting I thought... "Wow, this girl hasn't left. She's worth it." "Don't mess it up, don't mess it up." And the money? That's true. I mean no, Like I wasn't mugged, But I forgot it when I rushed out. I see. But look, I know this is important to you, so if you want to leave... I'll walk you out. I can take you where you need, and it's ok if you don't want to see me anymore. Eduardo. This is our first fight, isn't it? What? Yes. This is our first official fight as a couple. You mean you're not angry? Look, there's a difference between chalk and cheese I'm mad about your lies, but... To leave and miss out on getting to know you, well that's different. So, you don't want to leave? Mm-hmm. Come here and apologize. I'm sorry. Really? Scout's honour. You sound pretty mature. Sorry. When you said earlier... That this was the best night of your life, was that true? One hundred percent. Ok. So, shall we start over? No? No. Let's just pick up where we left off. And where did we stop? I dunno. You tell me. Dinner. Yes No I mean dinner is burning, wait a sec. Shit. - Careful. Are you okay? I'm such a dumbass. Come here. Let me see. Yes. It really hurts. Careful. It hurts a lot. I think I burned a nerve. Don't be a crybaby. I'm not. It really hurts. What? - Pussy. - Pussy? Yeah well you didn't burn yourself. It's fine. Women have a higher pain threshold than men anyway. We can withstand childbirth and we're not complaining about small things. You must have already given birth to three children while taking selfies, huh? Nice. Alright, do yo have any Lavender oil? Olive oil? Ok. You don't have any. Any vinegar? Honey? Yeah. I got vinegar. And the plates are? On the left. Well, this is an old home remedy, the ones that work best of course. Grandma taught me. It won't smell too good, but it will help. So... Now you have to drink it all at once. Really? You want it to get infected and then cut off? It's not like a zombie bit me. I'll throw it away then. No, no. Wait a second. If your grandma says so, I guess.. Here I go. I knew it. Of course, why were you going to do it then? Well you said you didn't lie. That's a low blow. I didn't lie, I was just joking. Well it was a lie to me, and you did it very well. Stop whining. Give me your hand. It's going to sting a little, ok? - - There, there. You have to leave it in a few minutes. It will get better. See, how does it feel? Much better. Let me kiss the place where you're feeling some pain if it doesn't feel better I'll do it again. Better? A lot better. Thank you. You said you like me, didn't you? The question is what are we going to do with that? I don't think it will taste very good. Me neither. Let's see what we have here. Ham... Meat... Cheese... And grapes. Very well. If you want you can bring the glasses and I'll prepare a tasty dinner. Yes Ma'am. You know what they say about grapes and cheese? What? They taste like a kiss. It really tastes good. Why don't you bring this over to the table while I pour us some more wine. Sounds good? Cool. I'll help you. No, no, no. I lied, you paid for the tickets, and you're fixing up dinner. Please, let me do one thing for you. It's no problem, but if you want to. Please. Ok. Don't take too long. Or it will get cold. What did you say about grapes and cheese? That they tastes like a kiss. That's funny. I wonder why. I dunno. Maybe because they're both pleasures. Yep. They are pleasures. Almost! Did you like the wine? Yeah, it was good. Delicious, right? This is very french. Cheese, grapes, wine. Yeah. A very glamorous dinner. Hey where do you buy your fruit? It's super good. Thanks. At a nearby market. Eduardo. Eduardo. What's up? I don't know. You're acting weird. Did I do something? Am I going too fast? No, no, no. No. There it is again. What? The lies, Eduardo. I don't like you lying to me. Something's wrong and you're not telling me. I feel like this must be your worst date. You won't want to see me again. Of course not. Why would you think that? Well, this doesn't speak very highly of me. No, it doesn't. You could be the president or Gandhi for that matter and still have a bad day. I guess so. Now, eat cheese and grapes and compare. Why don't we toast? Ok, and what to? To the worst dates in history. To the worst dates in history. - Cheers. - Cheers. What? Just that little sip? You barely drank anything. What do you mean? You were the one who just told me how to taste a good wine, now you want me to drink like a teenager? I didn't say that, but you should drink more. It's a toast. Well you haven't drank much either. Look. Okay! Now it's your turn. No. No. - Well. - Go for it. - Ok. - Come on, Lili. But it's too much. You can do it. Come on. It's fine. Come on, come on. Fine, fine. You'll love it. Come on. Here I go. Yes! Yes Lili! Well done. Well done. Very well done, Lili. Wonderful. You did it great. What's up with you? I mean it's so good. You know it's not the first time I drink right? Well yes but... Cuz, you're kind of acting like a creep. Yes? What? No, I'm sorry, it's just the first time that... I hadn't met someone like you." I know that, because I'm unique. Yes. You are... Unique. So? Where did we leave off? No, Eduardo. - Come on. - Stop. Eduardo, I told you to stop. I'm telling you to fucking stop. Ok. Calm down! We just kissed, what's the problem? Well yeah, but not like this. I don't like it. I'm sorry. Sorry, I think I'm just a bit tipsy. Sorry, I'm an idiot. Yeah, a big idiot. I'm leaving. - What? - Yes. What? No, Lili, I'm sorry. We were having such a good time. Yeah. Yes, we were. That's past tense as in "You fucked up." No. Lili? Are you walking me out? I'd go myself but it's locked. Calm down, are you really leaving? Yes, really. I'm not feeling it. You seriously want to leave now? Yes, I want to leave. The keys please. - You're leaving? - Yes. Ha ha ha. Very funny, Eduardo. What? I can't find them. What's your problem. What a coincidence. I'm texting my friend and telling her you kidnapped me. Oh stop, Lili. Don't overreact. Calm down. By now I don't want you to stay either. I'll just find the keys. Are you ok? Yeah, the keys. I don't know maybe I left them in the kitchen. - Are you coming? - No. I'll wait here. I can't find them. Well, look further. That's what I'm doing. Stop it, Eduardo. I don't feel well. I want to leave. - Do you want an aspirin? - No, I want to leave... Leave. Yes I know. You want to leave. But what should I do? I can't find the keys. Help me look under the table. Stop messing with me. Well, aren't you the one who wants the keys? Don't be an ass. Let me see if they're near the stove. Nope. I don't see them. Do you see them? Lili. Lili? Lili? Are you ok, Lili? Lili. Lili? Are you just pretending? Are you lying? Even unconscious you're a liar, huh? Hey. Hey! It took you long enough. This nonsense about the cheese and grapes. "Cheese and grapes taste like kisses". They are good though. And you're hot. That explains a lot. Well then, Let's get to work. Where did you leave your phone? Here. How about we take this upstairs? You'll love it. It's more intimate, quiet. Want to go? Of course, I do! You're so cool! I know, I know. Ok. Let's go then. Here we go. Whoa, wait a sec. I don't want to get hurt. That's enough. one, two... I should have given you the drink upstairs. I'm so stupid. What do you think? Very well. Let's get you comfortable. I have to wake you up, right? Let's do it. What's going on? Calm down, I didn't tie it too tight so you could still breathe. Help! Nevermind. No one can hear you. That must be another one of your lies. What did I do to you, Eduardo? Nothing. So? What do you want? Ok. I get it. It's one of those hidden camera pranks, right? There's a camera. Like on TV. Candid Camera, right? Ok guys, I got it! Very funny, but you can untie me now. Eduardo, stop fooling around and untie me. Please. Untie me. Are you deaf? Or are you stupid? Must be one of those two because... I just told you, no one can hear you. So. Are you going to keep up the drama like Meryl Streep? Or can we begin? Begin? To tell you why you are here. Why you're tied up. And last but not least. Why you are going to die tonight. Please, Eduardo. - No? - Please. - Yes? - Please. Ok. Let's start. What did you say you liked to read? Fight Club, right? Nevermind. Imagine our first page reads "Based on true events". Tough crowd, huh? Ok. Since we're in Mexico, and in Mexico stories don't always have happy endings. This story is not exception. Oh, by the way. In every story there is a hero, and a villain. A good guy and a bad guy. They're usually easy to identify. The obvious case is Star Wars. Princess Leia always dresses in pristine white. While Lord Darth Vader in all-black. If we saw our clothing. Who would be the hero and who would be the villain, Lili? I don't know, Eduardo. I don't understand any of this. I hate spoilers, but... In this story, the bad guy doesn't look like they should. Sometimes they're warm, happy people. I don't like the term, but, innocent. But just on the outside, to lure in their victims. Eduardo, let me go. Nothing has happened. I won't tell anyone. They're charismatic people, charming. Sorry. Be quiet. Like at the movies. Not a word, understand? Do you know that in Mexico, every 90 minutes someone goes missing? No, I didn't know. In a city, no. In a country with such statistics. How can there be people like us? Who think an app is fun and safe to date? Why Lili? I don't know. I don't know. So why do you use it? I asked you a question. For love, for fun, company. I don't know. Yeah. All good answers. Please, don't let my opinion have an influence on this. I believe that in a place with 7,000 million people. We feel alone. Can you believe it? Humans are social by nature. But we're so self-centered. That we feel alone. And what's wrong with that? Wrong? Nothing. No, no, no. Actually, loneliness is part of existence. But we lower our defenses when we feel the slightest bit of hope. We buy a one-way ticket for our precautions and... We forget about them. And that's where external factors come. There are people, if you can call them that. Who are not right in here. Do you know what they do Lili? Do you? I don't know. They fuck... And never call back. I don't know, Eduardo. They fuck and not call again. Sorry but I need to laugh. It's the best thing I've heard. No that's not it. They don't do that. I mean, it can happen. Ok they do it. But... That's not the reason you're here. Let me remind you my three questions. Why are you here. Why are you tied up. And last but not least. Why are you going to die tonight. What these people do is murder. And that's what you are. Lili. You are a murderess. What? Do you know this man? Do you recognize him? - Do you? - Eduardo No you don't. Let's see. Him? Who is he? No. You don't know him either. I don't know what you're talking about, I think you're confused. Do you remember her? - No. - No? "When nothing works, just switch." Wasn't that what you said? Yes, but I don't know who they are. I don't understand anything. You killed these people Lili. These people are missing, and the only thing they have in common, is you. You're crazy, darling. If someone's crazy here, it's you. Darling. Why do you think that? You know me, Eduardo. We'd been chatting online for a while. I was lying. It was a plan to bring you here tonight. Let me go. I don't even know you're real name. Mine is Eduardo, what about you? Lili. The wine really got into your head. Everything is right here. Of course, it is. Do you want to tell the story? No, no, no. You're doing so well. Thank you. Ok. Well, I don't want to have you here all night. I'm going to make the long story short. We don't know your origin, but we know you've been in Mexico for two years. This is the 6th time you change identity and I suppose this would be your 7th, right? Wow. It's like I'm a CIA agent. No, no, no. You're just a despicable woman. That kills people. We don't know why, but we'd like to. Why are you speaking in plural? What do you mean? "We don't know..." You don't think I did this alone did you? I hired a hacker. You know, all that Deep Web stuff, it's real. And surprisingly cheap. And there's a lot of shit too. Don't you see? These people made you think I'm the person from your papers to get your money. They play you for a fucking fool. - - Do you know him? Hey, bro? Wait a sec. You don't know how much I miss you. I have so much to tell you. I'm dating this girl. Really, I don't know what she saw in me. But, you'll know soon enough. If all goes well. I think you'll have to buy a tux soon. Let me leave this here, she doesn't like pictures too much. She's coming. Maybe you can meet her. If all goes well, I'll introduce her to you. - - Ready, babe? What did you order? A coffee mojito. Try it. Do you like it? Yeah. It's different. I love you. What? Are you recording? Yes. I'm sending this to Lalo. No, babe, I told you I'll like to meet him in person. C'mon babe, just a little. Ok then. I can't say no to you, huh? No. This was the last time that I saw my brother. Roberto. Now, do you remember him? Who is the woman in the video, Lili? It's me. Who? - It's me. - I didn't hear you. - It's me. - What did you say? It's me, Eduardo. What happened? What always happens. We went to dinner, drank and... And I invited him over because I was alone that night. And what happened? You killed him, didn't you? You killed him! I swear I didn't. That was the last time I saw him. We went home and made love. "Made love" You fucked, that's different. I don't know. I didn't feel that way. That's why I said there's some people who fuck and never call. Because Roberto never called back. I thought he used me. What happened to him? That's what you need to explain. How I see it, there's two options. The first, I kill you like a dog and leave you where no one will find you. And the second one, you tell me what happened. And then I kill you. Which do you prefer? One... ...or two. I can only imagine what you've suffered. One... To have your brother killed, must be horrible. ...or two. I'm going to open the door, and then you'll tell me everything. Eduardo, you're very confused. Those people made you think that to get all your money. It's all lies I haven't done anything to you. Eduardo, I haven't done anything. Coming! - - Coming! Hey, Lalo! What's up, Poncho? Hey, sorry to bother you. Sorry, I was in the bathroom. Don't worry. So, what's up? Just tell him, dude. Shut up! Tell me, what can I do for you? It's just I'm a bit embarrassed. Just say it. Well. My parents are on a trip. And these blockheads are sleeping over. Hello. And we wanted to see if... You want alcohol. Yeah! But we have money. - Money. - Just a sec. Money. Lot of money. Come in, let's see what I can do for you. Cool, cool. Thanks. Shut the door. Thanks, sir. Sir? I'm barely 32 years old. Is 30 the new old? No, of course not. Don't mind these idiots. DIEGO: I just wanted to be polite. So, what do you want? What do you have? You have no freaking idea, huh? Let me see what I can help you with. What you're doing? Dude, you have to see this. It's an important meeting. Stay focus. Take it easy, dude. Focus, man. Do you want some booze or not? Is there another party on this house or what? Sorry, sorry. All right, we're all here. Ok then, I guess your obvious choice is tequila, right? Tequila. Mm-hmm. Is it good? Of course, it is. What question is that? But, if you want to get drunk and don't want to kill me tomorrow. I recommend vodka. Dude, isn't that a girl's drink? Dude, what? Vodka is distilled from potatoes. From potatoes. And the hangover or headache. Hangover. Is way more lighter than tequila. Lighter. This is an elegant drink, guys. Very elegant, dude. If you offer this to one of your girlfriends, you've already won. This here. This here, is what you need to get women. That's for you, Poncho. We'll take it. We'll take it. You know what? You only live once so, Tequila is on me. - Really? - Sure. Thank you so much, Lalo, really. If you wanna come by for a drink - you're more than welcome. - No, thank you. What was that? I think that was just a neighbor who started the party early. Yeah, sure. Thank you, really. Help me! I'll walk you out. C'mon, I'll open the door. I'm up here! I'm up here! DIEGO: Dude, seriously, what was that? I dunno. It came from upstairs. Please! Help! You know what. I left my Netflix open, and the volume's loud, I'll turn it down. Don't worry. I won't bother you. After you, Ponchito. Ok, thanks Lalo. Sure. Poncho! Come here. Listen. We're neighbors. This is on me, it's a favor. Here. Here. I didn't do anything and you didn't do anything. Nobody saw anything. About what? The booze. I didn't sell you anything, and you didn't buy. We're all innocent. So no one saw or heard anything, ok? Got it? Thank you. Ok then, take care. See you, guys. I'm sorry Eduardo. I'm just... Sorry. I'm just so afraid. I won't do it again. I'm really sorry. Please. Forgive me. What are you doing? Don't, please. Eduardo, please. Give me one more chance. I swear I won't do it again, I'm just scared. Please. Please, please. Don't do it. Don't ever do that again. Now, where were we? Oh Yeah. You were about to tell me how my brother died. Eduardo... I told you I have nothing to do with that. I met your brother, but I never saw him again. He came to my place. We had sex. He got dressed and left. Then he never called. I swear it, Eduardo. Do you know what primal fear is? - No. - It's very simple. Primal fears exist since the Stone Age. Fear to the dark. Fear to death. - No. - You know? Please. They're part of our DNA. And as much as we wanted to hide them, they always show up. What are you going to do, Eduardo? From your face... I can tell that these objects make you scared, right? It's a primal fear of getting hurt. A basic response. Very good. In this hand, I have something that will make you even more afraid than these other three. Fire is... The biggest fear. Where is my bro-- Fuck! Dumbass. You're pathetic. Who's laughing now, bitch! - Fuck, this can't be. I can't believe it. What's up, Luis? What happened dude? I'm busy. No. What? Wait, calm down. Where are you? I don't know. Hey, calm down. Wait. I'm coming. I'm coming down. Wait. Wait there. Don't do anything stupid. I'm coming down. LUIS: This dude is an asshole! What's up bro? How are you? - I'm doing good, man. - Good? Cool. So, what's up? You spilled something on your shirt there. I'm kidding, bro. What? Why are you so locked up? Are you hiding from the zombies? What? No, bro. You know how there's so many crazy people out there. But you're one of them, dude. Man, how are you? I'm ok. C'mon, come in. A little toad. What's up? What's up dude? I'm happy to see you, bro. Don't even call me anymore, man. Oh what? You having a party? - What? - You having a party? - No dude. - Oh c'mon. What are these? The neighbor's kid came by and wanted some booze, so I helped. Nice. Always so considerate, right? Just like your brother, man. How long it's been? Six months? Seven months and two weeks. Seven months and two... You know if I knew who the motherfucker was. So... Hey, what about you? Why did you show up? What? You're not happy to see me? Of course, but... Don't be silly, man. It's just I was on my way out. Mariana cheated on me. What? Mariana cheated on me. Mariana, your fiancée? The good news is I found out before the wedding. Saved my money. May I? Of course, I may. To be honest, bro. We're really stupid. - Yeah. - For real, man. We like a girl, we like her ass. Then we go, all stupid. We go after them and then forget the consequences no matter what. Cheers. And what happened? Nah dude, I don't want to talk about it. What about you? - Have a girlfriend? - No. Boyfriend? You're gay aren't you. Here's a kiss for you. Don't act dumb, someone told me they saw you with a girl. - What? - They saw you with a girl. What did they tell you? Earlier, at the park. No, no. Who told you that? - Isn't it true? - Who told you that? Virginia and Carlos. No, no. They lied to you. Aw cm'on, why would they lie? I don't now! They're mistaken. Whoa dude. You get really manly when you get mad. Another kiss. Aw c'mon Lalo. What's this then? C'mon dude, see how you lie. What's this? It's a woman's purse. Who's is it? Who's is it? Who? A slut's. A slut's? Yes, a slut's. A fucking slut. Like a hooker? With a fee? Are you paying to get fucked, bro? Nice! Titties! Titties! Titties! Where's is she? Where is the lady? - She left. - C'mon. Wait a second. It still smells like pussy here. It's like a house full of cats. Don't talk shit. I have to go give her the purse. That's why I have to leave. Seriously. Dude... You can lie to me once, but not twice. I'm serious. Luis. Where are you going? I'm going to the bathroom, dude. Chill out. You're snooping. I'm telling you she's gone. Listen, don't be stubborn. Ok, ok. Let's do something. I'll give her money and we'll have a threesome. Don't be stupid. Don't worry. You and me won't interact. Ok then, I'll pay her, and I get 15 minutes. Dude, you're drunk. Yep, a little. I'll call an UBER, you leave. You calm down, and sober up. What's with you dude? Are you her pimp or something? Aren't you going to introduce us, Eduardo? I think he should. Nice to meet you. Luis. No, don't give me your hand. Eduardo's friends are my friend. That's what I'm saying, we're all friends here. But he's not getting it. Have you seen my purse somewhere? Is it a pink one? It's on the table. Right. By the way... Thanks a lot. Are you looking for your phone? It's in the kitchen. Dude! She has a great ass. I'm going to ask her about the threesome. Wait, it's not what you think. - A blowjob then. - Don't be stupid. - Well you had your turn. - You gotta go. My phone isn't there, Eduardo. I don't know where you left it then. Oh are you partying? Yes. Listen. Don't you want to stay and drink with us. No thank you, I'm not a whisky girl. Don't worry. We have a lot of drinks. Rum, Gin... Rum, Rum. Rum is fine. Can you mix it please? Of course, sweetheart, anything for you. Thank you. I'll go to the store to get some ice. I'll be right back. You forgot that we went for ice this morning. LUIS: Hey guys, there's some ice here. Let's keep partying. LUIS: Hey look! Here's your rum. Great. Thanks. LUIS: Hey, this is a bit boring, isn't it? A toast. To my new best friend. Oh no. What did this bastard do to you? Nothing. I just fell. Come on, come on. Lalo told me you are a prostitute. How much? Leave me alone. How much for anal? I said leave me alone, asshole. Let me go. - Let me go! - Luis! Luis, what you're doing? Luis! What you're doing? Dude, don't worry. She's a hooker, it's all good. Help me. Luis, let her go. Stop! It's time for you to go. Let me go! Look at you. Aren't you ashamed? Whatever dude. What shame. Stupid whore. Fuck off dude. When you get gonorrhea don't come crying to me. Crybaby. I know this will sound ridiculous but... I owe you an apology. I don't think... You're the person I'm looking for. When my brother disappeared. My family and I went through hell. And... When I got your info, I think... I just let myself go and wasn't thinking clearly. I just needed to find the culprit. I'm sorry. I don't know. I don't know how to make up for this. I'll pay for the hospital, I'll pay for everything. When I saw this idiot treat you like that. I saw what I had become. Forgive me. I'm sorry. I can take you home or... I don't know what else to tell you. I don't know. You're right. You are my worst date. I don't like a good rum to go to waste. To bad experiences. I'm sorry. Bottoms up. It's a shame, Eduardo. I really liked you. And I really wanted this to go well. But tonight... You're life ends. And this, Eduardo. Is no threat. It's a promise. I can't remember much of your brother. There's been so many I lost track. What if I let the gas leak and say it was suicide? It was depression after your brother's disappearance, you couldn't bare it all. Why? Why? Why what? Why your brother? Or why do I kill? On the night of my 5th birthday. My father... Came into my room. My mother was asleep. He said he had a gift for me. He sat down next to me. He put my hand on... On his zipper. I was scared. But he said... It was ok. He said that was love. Then... He unzipped and... Son of a bitch. Or maybe not. Maybe... My parents were poor farmers. Who sold me to a drug lord. He taught me how to kill. Oh, and when I was a teenager. Some soldiers captured him and raped me in front of him. Just before they killed him as vengeance. Don't leave yet, Eduardo. I have so many stories. Maybe... They bullied me in school. Or that I have... Double... Or even triple personality! Do you like them? Be careful. You wouldn't want to hurt yourself. Let's see. Predictable. Too slow. Hey, you really do like cooking. You have all your spices. Wow, Eduardo. What's this for? I have to thank you for breaking my finger. And hitting me. Now I can say I shot you in self-defense. So... Let's tie up the loose ends of my story. No Eduardo! Please! Leave me! I don't want to! It's time to catch the mice. You're confused, aren't you? You don't know what to do. You're trying to not fall asleep. Looking for a place to hide. Don't feel embarrassed. It's normal. It doesn't matter who you are. Or how much money you have. If you have a gun pointing at you, you panic. Primal fears, right? That's what you told me. Let's see what you got here. Jeez, Eduardo. You really wanted to have a good time. All these toys. Let's take a look at your papers. Wow! Whoever sees this will think you were obsessing over me. Thank you, for all the help. He never called again. Everything ok? All right. You aren't up here. Which means you passed out somewhere down there. Asshole! Police! Drop the weapon! Drop the weapon, punk! Calm down, Lalo. Drop the weapon! Come on, Poncho. You call them? Bitch... Is there anyone else in the house, Miss? Miss, is there anyone else in the house? - No. - Check the area. Lalo? Are you ok, Miss? Are you hurt? He broke my hand. Dude, they shot him! Wait a moment, dude! I'm sorry. I'm serious, dude. Let's go. All clear, Sir! He's bleeding, dude! Calm down, Miss. Help is on the way. Kids you can't be here. Let's go! Miss, can you stand up? You're doing fine. Take your time. Take a breath. Slowly. Can you tell me what happened? We were on a date. Calm down. Look me in the eyes. And he went mad. Is he your boyfriend? Where did you meet him? Online. Where's the ambulance? EMT is on the way. You'll be fine. It's very dangerous to meet people online, Miss. The world is full of crazy people. You'll have to come with me, ok? Yes. Is there anyone we can contact? No. Don't worry. You are safe now. Yeah. I know.
