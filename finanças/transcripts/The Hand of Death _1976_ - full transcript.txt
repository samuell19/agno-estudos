BUDDHA Since its establishment, the Shaolin Temple has undertaken promotion of martial arts development having created many chivalrous young heroes for meritorious service to past emperors. Now, in order to eliminate dissidents, the Qing court has exercised control over the martial circle going so far as to collude with bad elements from within the temple to destroy Shaolin. The torture and murder of numerous monks became a catastrophe for the martial circle. In fact, masters and disciples from temples across various regions, in order to defend its reputation and integrity, and preserve the 'good roots', were reluctantly compelled to leave the temple, and dispersed across the country. Unfortunately, the righteous path is beset by evil temptations from the outside world. Born in Shaolin Temple, Shih Shao-Feng went back on his word, willingly acting as running dog and extinguishing his natural instincts. The number of masters and disciples slaughtered was innumerable. Leave. Master, go quickly! Go! Shih Shao-Feng? Shih Shao-Feng knows he has made too many enemies. These past ten years, besides training The Eight Tiger Generals to protect him from outsiders, he has never for a moment been complacent in his own martial arts. He's done perfecting the White Crane-Soul Chasing Fist. To avoid the disaster of extermination, we flee to the east, hide in the west. Years pass in the blink of an eye. When can we bring this traitor to justice? Master, please allow our disciples to go down the mountain. We've studied for five years to subdue Shaolin's traitor. You want to deal with Shih Shao-Feng? That's not an easy thing to do. First, you must pass all the tests in Shaolin martial arts. Or else, you'll find it very difficult to get close to him. We submit, Master, although at present our training is incomplete, in future, we can go down the mountain to gather the underground heroes. If our will is united, we're sure to be capable of dealing with him. Your zeal is commendable. But to deal with Shih Shao-Feng... only one of you is up to the task.

Yun Fei, your ability to pass the Shaolin array test proves your martial arts is already accomplished. Master will now send you down the mountain to deal with the Shaolin traitor, Shih Shao-Feng. Yes. I, Yun Fei, swear before heaven, to face neither my master nor my ancestors until I kill Shih Shao-Feng. Yun Fei, before annihilating Shih Shao-Feng, you must first destroy his major conspiracy. What conspiracy? At present we have heroes everywhere plotting to overthrow the Manchu Qing. Seven days from now they will rendezvous in the foreign settlement. There's a man named Chang I... who will come to the meeting with a secret map of the Qing army's main garrison in the Liangguang region. Shih Shao-Feng knows about it? He also knows that to keep the appointment it's necessary for Chang I to pass through his garrison in White Rock. Crossing White River to the settlement, Shih Shao-Feng has already cast many heavy nets to trap and kill him. I must find Chang I before Shih Shao-Feng, keep him safely away from the garrison. Also, you must first go to White Rock and get in contact with your junior disciple Chiu Kuo. - Then you'll learn Chang I's whereabouts. - Yes. People say White Rock is a tiger's lair. Shih Shao-Feng is a crazy dragon. You must be careful. Master, please don't worry. You said that the purpose of martial arts is to help save lives and focus on justice. I will complete the appointment regardless of life or death. Good spirit. Although Shih Shao-Feng has ample experience, your root comprehension is better than his. As for how to defeat his martial arts, you'll have to watch for your chance. Thank you, Master, for your advice. Take care of yourself. Thanks. Hey, halt... What are you doing here? Oh, I'm delivering firewood to the Commander's house. Did you see any strangers on the way, eh? No, no... - Who's he? - Ah, my brother. Fuck! Ah, that's right! My uncle. What did you say? Fuck your Uncle? Son-of-a-bitch! Little bastard! This kid! - Get going... - Thank you, Officer. Come on out. Come on, lend a hand. - Who is this? - Maybe it's a Shaolin brother who was killed? - Are you a fugitive? - No. Studied martial arts? Who the hell are you? A Shaolin brother. Thank you for helping me through the checkpoint. What are you doing? I don't want... to let his flesh be eaten by wild birds. Ah, young brother. Wait a minute. I tell you, there are two kinds of people who aren't fit to survive in this place. One kind is inclined to be too inquisitive. The other kind is... Shaolin brothers. Mind your own business! - You... - This way. This way. Now, hear this. Serious criminal Chiu Kuo will receive the punishment of beheading for plotting to assassinate Commander Shih. In future, any person involved in the same offence, will have their entire clan exterminated without exception. Beheaded in the street. Today, he's an example. Chiu Kuo? Yes, I hear he's a leading rebel against the Qing court. Who's that on the roof over there? Those men must have come to rescue him. That one down there? One of Shih Shao-Feng's Tiger Generals? - Oh, no! - What's 'oh, no'? Big Brother, go quickly! Fuck! They fell into a trap. They really are too cunning. Merciful Buddha. - Search all sides. Hurry up! - Yes. Who is it? Who are you? - Quick, help him into a room. - Wait over there. Come. Open up... Fuck! Taking so long to open a door? Officer, I'm sorry... Oh, Lord Tu, how are you? Have you seen a wounded dog crawl in? I haven't seen it. I haven't seen it, my Lord. - Search. - Yes. - Look here. - OK. Lord Tu, you have much forgiveness. Bastards, disturbing my nap! Retreat. Very powerful boxing. - May I know your name? - I'm nobody. For several years, I've been against these pestilent demons. A skill such as yours is rarely seen. - Want to be an official? - I appreciate the thought. Commander Shih admires me. This is known as a hero acknowledging a hero. I admire you very much, too. I can smell a hero from within a hundred paces. As long as I think highly of you, you can do great things. My name's Tu Ching. Once you've thought it over, come find me at the court. Let's go. Our guest is leaving? Thank you... Guest, how badly is he hurt? He may recover in just a few days. Young people have a shared mobility. Look how desperate he was to fight those Qing soldiers. He truly deserves to be called a Shaolin hero. Pity he had such bad luck. Guest, I see you're unfamiliar. You must have a purpose for coming here? I'm also here to deal with Shih Shao-Feng. So, you're...? A Shaolin brother. Oh, I should've seen it already. You could say, a wise head keeps a closed mouth. No wonder that official dog Tu Ching also thinks you're a big hero. But you can't talk about it. Of course. I'm a Han too, aren't I? Boss, today inside the inn there was an individual carrying a long sword. A mighty hero skilled in blowing a bamboo flute. Who is he? Oh, he's totally different from you. He's a good-for-nothing. He looks like a hero in the martial circle. Why would you say that? Having said that, the man's not too bad at all. This vagrant comes with quite a bit of history. Until some years ago, no one knew from where this young fellow came. A master of pen and sword, obscure and nameless. Everyone called him the 'Prodigal Son of Jiangnan'. Prodigal Son, please show us your sword. - Let us see your experience. - Yes. That's right, let us see your experience, OK? Go on. - That's scary. - Help her inside, hurry... What a Prodigal Son of Jiangnan! Oh, what kind of wind has blown Lord Shih here today? Inside the Spring Moon, our famous 'flowers' are each delicate as a flower. Lord Shih, who would you like to serve you? - Autumn Moon. - Oh? Lord Shih, Autumn Moon has a guest today. - Take me through. - Yes! - Lord Shih, are you tired? - How about something to eat? Autumn Moon... What is it? Our Lord likes you. - So arrogant! - Fuck you, kid! Prodigal Son, the sword! Autumn Moon... My Lord, get rid of this kid. Save your energy. He's suffering more now than if dead. The Prodigal Son's been down and out ever since, his sword long sheathed. The Jiangnan sword's disappearance has left only a false reputation. Lingering on wine and women all day long... What a pity for a hero! It's a waste to abandon great martial arts just for a woman. A man like this has no aspiration. Not necessarily. As the saying goes, "everyone is good for something". Whether useful or not depends on oneself. - My two friends. - Brother Chiu. You mustn't move about. Be careful of your wounds. Thank you... for saving my life. Brother Chiu, don't mention it. We admire your courage. Hateful... my martial arts aren't good enough to eliminate that brigand, Shih Shao-Feng. Really ashamed, I'm really ashamed. - Brother Chiu. - You... Boss, go change the basin of water. Oh, OK. You... know of me? I'm Yun Fei, it was Zen Master Ta Chih who asked me to contact you. Oh, that's great. Is it about Chang I? Shih Shao-Feng has numerous eyes open. It's inconvenient for you to speak here, can you still walk? Let's go. Brother Chiu, how can I find Chang I? He's unlikely to just show up. I made an appointment with him. The meeting's in five days at the top of three-way lane. Oh, by the way. How could you fall into their hands? I planned to assassinate Shih Shao-Feng, so that Chang I could leave safely. Unfortunately, our plan failed. Brother Chiu, would you be willing to work with me? Me? Do you have a good plan? Only by your lending a helping hand can I get close to Shih Shao-Feng. I refuse to believe he's so difficult to deal with. Don't you worry. As long as I can be of use, it doesn't matter if I die. Good spirit. Look, this is the password for my meeting with Chang I. Cross the river the moment you receive him. Naturally, our men will be there to meet him on the opposite bank. Don't worry, I'll remember. Hey, what is it? I want to see Lord Tu. Who do you think you are? Just say that I'm your father. How dare you! Just you wait... Oh, so it's you! I knew you would come. Because only a hero can appreciate a hero. How about it? Do you want a commission? OK! In short, I'll recommend you to Commander Shih right away. These days, it's better to be an official than a saint. A decade of prosperity, promiscuity, and happiness. I'll let you be martial instructor with an official's salary of five hundred piculs a year, how about it? No, a salary of five thousand piculs a year. What? You're not going to be like me! Do you want to destroy my livelihood? I want to be a Lord, too. As a mere martial instructor, I'd have to toil for no less than ten years to profit. You talk too much! Eh, why should Commander Shih choose you? With your recommendation... and a great gift from me... I've no doubt he'll agree. OK. I'll see what you've got. Move... This guy's really skilful. How about it? When do we leave? We leave right now. Commander. Commander. Your name's Yun Fei? The Yun Fei without a sect, with conceit in his own ability? Yes. You brought me this good-for-nothing just to seek a commission? Correct. Then why didn't you kneel before me? All who are under me, must kneel before me. This is the officialdom's tradition. One seeking a commission by kowtowing, may not possess genuine ability. Can't say for sure, but there may be a pack of dogs behind you. Wagging their tails for pity. Wise opinion. You're the first person who dares speak to me like this. You... Not only do they kneel before me, but all are loyal and devoted. Furthermore, each and every one has ability. Now, let's see your ability. Kill him. I'll kill you, you brigand! Oh, I forgot to introduce... This is Ma Lieh of Guanwai's Ditang Gate. A graduate of North Shaolin. Known as "Smiling Face, Flying Tiger". This is Tu Ching. His personality is more impulsive. He's collected the essence of both the Tiger and Crane Fist styles to create the resistant Praying Mantis Hands style. You've met them both before. I think you're more likely to get rich by opening a coffin shop. For you to be an official is an insult to the post. Little Brother, I found out we both have one thing in common. It's about making our mark on history, even if our names live on in infamy. - You're not qualified for either of these. - Oh, is that so? - Because it's impossible for you to beat me. - Not necessarily. Now you're trapped like a turtle in a jar, I don't think you need hide anymore. I was born in West Shaolin Temple, a disciple of Zen Master Ta Chih. Oh? In that case we're fellow students. You want to kill me? On master's instruction, I must kill you! One-by-one, many arrogant youths have fallen into my hands. Very well, let's see what Zen Master Ta Chih has taught his disciple. Infantile. Let me show you my Eight Tiger Generals. Turns out the Shaolin Hero is a big coward. Kill me if you want, but you can't kill all the Shaolin brothers. If I wanted you dead, why would I need to use my sword? - Come, take him down. - Yes! Before dawn, he must reveal Chang I's whereabouts. This kid! Alright... You go on. Just tell where Chang I is, then you don't have to suffer like this. It's commonly said, "a wise man knows when the odds are against him." Of all the people you can kill, why must you pick our Commander? As long as I still have one breath, Shih Shao-Feng will never have a day of peace. You're a hard-headed individual! Stubborn! Even though I admire you, if you continue to resist, I can't help you. After all, I get paid by them. Fuck! This kid has an accomplice. Hey, how's it going? - Better, is it? - Thank you. I already said, there are two kinds of people who aren't fit to survive here. One kind is inclined to be too inquisitive. The other kind is... Shaolin brothers. I think your dog life is close to the end. I think the same about yours. Why do you say that? Because you're the other kind of person. Too inquisitive. - You saved me. - I... I won't speak with you. You play with your life, sooner or later the game will be over. The death of one man alone can be extremely valuable. That's not the same as an untimely death. TAN HSIUNG: SPIRIT TABLET of DECEASED ELDER BROTHER Tan Hsiung? He was my elder brother. Shih Shao-Feng killed him. From childhood, we studied at the Shaolin Temple. To cultivate ourselves, like other young men. Hoping to become men of strength and discipline. Brother, in recognition of justice, couldn't stand idle and watch Shih Shao-Feng's deeds. He united a group of hot-blooded young men. Together, they moved to kill the Qing officials. I didn't expect that he would die at the hands of Shih Shao-Feng before achieving any triumph. You make firewood for Shih Shao-Feng just for the chance to avenge your brother? I've played the fool these past three years, just waiting for the opportunity. Get out of the way... Listen up! Anyone daring to harbour fugitive Yun Fei will be killed without question. Anyone reporting his whereabouts, whether dead or alive, will be rewarded with five hundred gold taels. You're practising the stick method to counter Shih Shao-Feng's Horse-chopping Sabre? Yes. You! If his is a sword, and yours is a wooden stick, how can you beat him? Heavily outnumbered, it's hard to take care of them. First, we need to defeat Shih Shao-Feng's Eight Tiger Generals. For that we must depend on a heroic swordsman. Jiangnan's Prodigal Son. WINE Officers, please sit. - Give me a pot of wine. - Yes. You have a good sword. The vagrant swordsman named Jiangnan's Prodigal Son, is that your good self? The head valued at five hundred gold taels, is you? Merely Shih Shao-Feng thinking too highly of me, that's all. How can my insignificant life be worth so much money? Two of Shih Shao-Feng's spies have just arrived outside. If you were to call them over, and explain I was a fugitive... That five hundred taels of gold would be yours. You think I would do this? I don't think so. I've heard only of the Jiangnan Prodigal Son's righteous spirit. Absolute Sword. It hasn't been used in over a year. More than a year... You've gone so far as to injure your vigour for a woman? What a great pity! Don't mention my woman! The slightest difference leads to a huge error. If you had been the Jiangnan Prodigal Son of old, I would be in heaven now. What do you want? To make you my friend, so we can deal with Shih Shao-Feng together. Good swordwork. Let's go. Now I'm a wanted man, too. - Big Brother, we've looked hard for you. - Little Brother, what are you doing here? After Master learnt of brother Chiu Kuo's murder... he feared you couldn't handle it alone, so asked us to come help you. Good. More men, more strength. Let's go. - This is... - Jiangnan's Prodigal Son. - Little Brother Tan. - So, you've already...? The sword doesn't leave the body. Apart from Jiangnan's Prodigal Son, no outsider wears the vagrant's proud smile. Little Brother, you praise me too much. - And these two? - They're my younger brothers. Wait a minute. Let me do the manual work. I'll recast it properly. It'll take some time. What are you...? Evade. Evade. Tiger's Paw. Shih Shao-Feng's White Crane-Soul Chasing Fist catches people out through their indecision. Taking advantage of the iron sand palm, the trick is using it to exploit the opponent's vital points. If you get inside right away, you can damage his muscles and break the tibia and make his White Crane-Soul Chasing Fist count for nothing. Put on oil. Good. Dear Brother, I wonder which famous mountain your good self is from? Although there are many famous mountains, I'm from Jinzhong Mountain. May I ask your good self your reputable name? "If two eyes can't recognise a famous person, one thousand in gold can't buy a pair of rocks." CHANG I - Mr Chang, please come with me. - Good. Let me. Commander Shih, what a brilliant idea! You only know random flattery. Spineless cowards! Do you have any news from our spies? Commander, according to reports, Chang I has already shown his face and Yun Fei has practised Tiger's Paw to deal with you. Even if he has Buddha's Palm, it's hard to resist my Eight Tiger Generals. - Pick up the arrows. - Yes, Sir. Pass on the order, mobilise the Eight Tiger Generals immediately. - Stick to White River, kill anyone you see. - Yes, Sir. A few nobodies practising monkey's paws and kicks think they're good enough to scare me? - Carry him over. - Yes, Sir. I never trust people who are especially nice to me. - Commander Shih, you're really shrewd. - Yes... Alright, enough of that! Good. Prodigal Son, Big Brother Yun. With this, you can deal with Shih Shao-Feng's Horse-Chopping Sabre. Whirlwind Overlord Spear. - A little toy. - Young Brother Tan, it's not good. - What's the matter? - It's not good. Yesterday, you asked me to spy for news. Shih Shao-Feng has issued an order, that said... - Said... - Said what? Said that, he's decided tomorrow to mobilise the Eight Tiger Generals to defend White River. He's prepared to kill every last one of you. Old man, you go back first. We've kept you, I fear you'll be implicated. I hope that one day this demon will get what he deserves. How treacherous! I say, attack Shih Shao-Feng now! No, if we attack in haste, we'll meet the same fate as Tan Hsiung and Chiu Kuo. Maybe we'll be killed before we even reach the garrison. Furthermore, Mr Chang's safety is in all our hands. At present, everyone must remain calm. Shih Shao-Feng may be shrewd, but he doesn't know how many men we have. This is very beneficial to us. If they disperse their power... The Tigers lured from their domain are unprepared for our attack. Right, I've got it. This is Shih Shao-Feng's residence. It's five miles from White Rock Garrison. Usually, unless something big happens, Shih Shao-Feng rarely appears in court. Tu Ching and six Tiger Generals are stationed there. There's a major checkpoint outside the garrison at the East Gate. But only Feng Kang and Feng Hai - the two Flying Tiger brothers - guard it. Tomorrow morning, we split up and set out on two paths. I'll attack the East Gate first. Tu Ching is simple-minded, his personality impulsive. When he hears news, he'll immediately deploy six Tiger Generals to provide outside support. Then it's time to see me. The Prodigal Son and I will promptly take Mr Chang outside the garrison. Enemies successfully lured, we all meet outside the garrison. Take a shortcut and immediately escort Mr Chang across the river. We return with a sudden thrust, behead the six generals, and deal with Shih Shao-Feng. Dear friends, who can claim integrity firm as a mountain. Tomorrow will be very dangerous, life and death uncertain. Chang will never forget any of you as long as he lives. Buddha needs incense and a man needs self-respect. As long as I can comfort the spirit of my deceased elder brother death means nothing more than a big hole opened on my body. I've never done anything meaningful. This time, I'd like to see if I haven't wasted my life. My head severed, my blood may flow, but I swear I'll never become a Qing. My Lords, there's suspicious movement in the distance. Shaolin kids! - You, come. - Here. Quick, dispatch a rider to inform Lord Tu there are Shaolin troops. - Do we attack? Ask his Lordship to decide. - Yes, Sir. What are you doing? Go away... Reporting, My Lord! There are Shaolin troops attacking the garrison outside the East Gate. - My Lord, your decision? - What? Fuck! How brazen! You, come over. - Set off at once, provide support to the East Gate. - Yes. Reporting, Commander! There are Shaolin kids attacking outside the East Gate. Go ahead. Let's go. This way. Commander. Reporting, Commander. We arrived at the East Gate, but their plan was to lure we tigers from our domain. Commander, we've been fooled! Reporting, Commander. Your humble servant be damned. I was impulsive. Misdirecting the troops led the East Gate to fall. A thousand deaths cannot atone for my guilt. Reporting, Commander. Our spies lost track of their whereabouts. I think they took a shortcut and ran off. A small setback. Save your crocodile tears. Set off at once, hunt them down to White River. Even if they have flying legs, it's hard to escape my spies. Yes, Sir. - Prepare the horse. - Yes, Sir. A few young rogues dare tease a stately official? Chase down the East Road. Oh, no! Perhaps word leaked out? Quick, let's go. Chase. Big Brother Yun, you go first. No, we must stay together. I've waited three years for this chance. Go quickly! Brother Tan. Chase the extent of White River. Let me do it. Big Brother Yun. Brother Tan. - Brother Tan, you must compose yourself. - There's no time, you must go now. I'm fine. Big Brother Yun, he'll be fine. We'll be caught in the same trap. Let's get out of here. - Hurry, see Mr Chang aboard. - Right, let's go! Grab the map. Go quickly! - Big Brother Yun... - Don't worry about me. Mr Chang, where's your map? It's here. Prodigal Son. Prodigal Son! Mr Chang, please come with me. I made a mistake in underestimating you. It's destined that one of us will fall down. You've damaged my honour. Now I have no option but to fight back and put my life on the line.
