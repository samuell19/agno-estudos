Rinaldi) Well, this marriage is not to take place, neither to-morrow, nor at any other time!... Lucia Mondella (Miss Emilia Vidali) Her mother: Agnese (Mrs. Ida Carloni Talli) Perpetua - the Priest's Housekeeper (Miss Olga Capri) ... does not want the marriage to be performed... Signor Curate, what time would it be convenient for you that we should be at the church?... Be patient!... I cannot today... I feel unwell today... ... and what's more… there are difficulties... It is all over for today!... That damned Don Rodrigo!... So you knew?... The Signor Curate is ill... and the wedding cannot take place today!... Speak then!... By the grace of God this day was the last of the weaving, and I did not meet that lord ever again... In the meantime Don Rodrigo and his cousin, Count Attilio... ... were listening to Griso's report... (Messrs Mario Parpagnoli and Fernando Ribacchi) Do as I say, go and ask Dr. Azzeccagarbugli (Dr. Quibbleweaver) for advice!... It is necessary to explain things clearly to the lawyer... then it will be up to us to complicate matters... Good day, Friar Galdino... I compelled the Signor Curate to tell me the cause; and he confessed that he had been forbidden, on pain of death, to perform the ceremony... This powerful Don Rodrigo!... I will not listen to tales of this sort!... I would like you to tell Friar Cristoforo that I am in a great hurry to speak to him... ... when Friar Cristoforo left his cloisters in Pescarenico... (Friar Cristoforo: Enzo Biliotti) ... to walk up to the cottage where he was expected. What do you say of that villain?... I will go myself today to speak to this man... If God touches his heart, and my words have some power, well... If not... By God's grace we will find some other remedy! Reverend Father... Come in... come in! I wish to speak with you alone... With two nimble and cunning witnesses... you will go to the curate... The man says: this is my wife... The woman says: this is my husband... The marriage is as good as done, sacred, as if the Pope himself had celebrated it!... Some dishonest men have hidden behind the name of Your Excellency to frighten a poor curate, and overpower two innocents... With one word you can bewilder these men, and in this way... your conscience... You may speak of my conscience when I come to you to make my confession!... Do not keep a poor creature in fear and distress... Advise her to come, and place herself under my protection... she will want for nothing!... Your protection?... You have filled the measure, and I fear you no longer! ...A day will come!... You villain, thank the habit you bear!... Out of here!... I am afraid that my master is contriving some regrettable action with his bravoes... In the meantime Friar Cristoforo, unaware of what his protégés were doing, was trying to provide for their safety... Is this an hour for Christians?... I have here with me the twenty-five new pieces that I owe Don Abbondio... Would you believe it?... He obstinately persisted in saying ... that you were not married to Beppe Suolavecchia... ...because he did not want you!... Signor Curate, in the presence of these witnesses, this is my wife... Friar Cristoforo is waiting for you... You see, my children, this country is not safe for you!... You can stay in Monza... go and look for our convent... Send for the Superior and give him this letter... And you Renzo, take this letter to Father Bonaventura... ... at our convent at the eastern gate of Milan... Go to the lake shore... Everything is ready... As a pack of blood-hounds, after having in vain tracked the hare... ...return mortified towards their master, with their ears down, and tails hanging... My heart tells me that we shall meet again soon... Farewell, you mountains rising from the waters and ascending to the sky... Sister Gertrude is not a nun like the others... they call her the Signora... ...And if she accepts you, you'll be as safe as if you were on the altar... This is the poor girl, for whom, Your Excellency, I have solicited your protection... The friar's hand is in this business!... Trust me for once; I will serve you as a relation and a friend!... I'll give that friar what he deserves!... In the meantime Renzo had arrived in Milan... Renzo, chewing his bread, was walking towards the eastern gate village, and making his way, unknowingly, towards the centre of a riot. Plenty! There's plenty!... But in fact famine had broken out... Plenty existed only in the imagination of the people, who, raging against some alleged hoarders, set off to raid the bakeries... To the bakeries!... Let's go to the Vicar!... Let us do justice!... The Vicar of Provision, he who, in times of hunger and darkness, should be held responsible for all kinds of evil, as the Commissioner of Supply... Crucify him!... Would you take the hangman's business out of his hand?... How can you expect God will give us bread, if we commit such iniquity?... He is a spy!... Time ago, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Milan, Antonio Ferrero, had arbitrarily lowered the price of bread in order to gain the people's favour. I am here to take him to prison!... To inflict on him a just punishment!... He is anything but a gentleman!... He is the one who, contrary to the Vicar's will, made the bread cheap!... Long life Ferrer!... Down with the tyrants!... The Vicar!... The Tyrant!... The Tyrant!... The starver!... I am in the hands of God and Your Excellency!... Come with me!... They will not touch you!... The people think that I am taking you to prison! ...If you make your voice heard, you'll be treated fairly!... Tyrants who oppress the weak ought to be brought to justice!... Amidst the commotion, Renzo had forgotten the purpose of his journey to Milan... As sure as my name is Renzo Tramaglino, I am here to do justice!... Prepare a good bed for this nice young man!... At the break of day, Renzo had been snoring for almost seven hours... Renzo Tramaglino, come with us!... Signor Captain of Justice will explain why!... The yells of the people still in uproar urged him to hurry, as he tried to persuade Renzo with kind words... Come on!... Be kind!... We will do you no harm!... Who will guarantee this to me?... Calm down!... Do as I tell you: go calmly and quietly... But of all these fine speeches Renzo believed not a word... He is a thief caught in the act!... Let justice have its way!... They are taking me to prison... ...because yesterday I cried: Bread!... ... And justice!... Leave Milan!... It is better for you... And Don Attilio kept his promise!... The friar was made to pay!... They will send him far away... It was an order for Friar Cristoforo to repair to Rimini for the purpose of preaching the Lent sermons giving up all thoughts of the business he has in the country he must leave... Don Rodrigo, more determined than ever to accomplish his fine deed, had resolved to seek the assistance of a terrible man... The Unnamed (Mr. Adolfo Badaloni) ...At the Monastery of Monza... Sister Gertrude... Nibbio!... Go to Monza... look for our friend Egidio... I believe the doors of that cloister sometimes open for him... In the meantime Agnese, worried about the lack of news of Friar Cristoforo resolved to go to Pescarenico. And the following day Nibbio returned with Egidio's answer: the deed was easy and safe. The same voice, which had gained power over the unhappy woman, now imposed on her the sacrifice of the innocent girl who had been intrusted to her care. I want you to do me a great favour... you alone can grant it to me... I have to speak to the Superior... but no one must know!... I can count on you alone to convey this message in secrecy... Lucia, more astonished than convinced by Sister Gertrude's insistence... cannot defy her will... and moves on... Young lady, please could you please show me the way to Monza?... Let me go!... Let me go!... I will pray for you all my life... Does it cost you so much to say one word?... There!... I see you are moved to pity... God pardons so many deeds for one act of mercy!... Oh! Why is she not the daughter of one of those henchmen who outlawed me!... That night... God pardons so many deeds for one act of mercy Most Holy Virgin, you, who have performed so many miracles for the afflicted, help me! I make a vow, to renounce that unfortunate fellow now, and forever, never to belong to anyone else but you. Why are the bells chiming?... Cardinal Federico Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan, has arrived. Cardinal Federico Borromeo (Mr. Bonaventura Ibanez) A strange visit, most illustrious signor... But... that outlaw!... Do you know who I am?... You have some good news for me, and I long for it dearly!... I have hell in my heart!... Something oppresses me!... If there is a God, what can he do with me?... ... A sign of his power and his benevolence!... ...He alone can fill you with love, hope, repentance!... Do you not feel it in your heart?... It is he who troubles and agitates you, and at the same time gives you hope for peace... for forgiveness!... Crowds await you!... So many innocent souls... ...You are occupied... with whom?... Those souls are perhaps happier as they are, than if they saw this poor Bishop... Perhaps the people are united to us without knowing it!... The last wicked deed, Lucia's terrors and regrets were the repentant's first confession... Is not this the parish priest of Pescarenico? I have a good news for you: one of your parishioners, Lucia Mondella, has been found... You must go with this dear friend of mine... ... to fetch that poor girl of yours, and bring her here!... The departure. Has he no bad habits?... Yes!... It is I... I came on horseback deliberately... on a mule!... He comes to set you free!... He is no longer the man he was!... He has become good!... Forgive me!... Donna Prassede, who was holidaying near Pescarenico, took Lucia under her protection in accordance with Cardinal Borromeo's wishes. (Donna Prassede: Mrs. Fiamma Donati) Agnese, aggrieved by Friar Cristoforo's departure, left her home once again and returned to the convent in Monza. Lucia... Thus Lucia was obliged to leave her mother and follow Donna Prassede, whilst Don Rodrigo... ...his loathsome deed having now proved futile, he too set off for Milan. In the meantime Renzo had letters sent to Pescarenico, seeking news of Lucia. Finally, joy and peace seemed to have been restored... The antichrists are coming!... To pillage!... They are bringing the plague!... Tomorrow they will be here!... The Germans!... Quick!... Let us escape!... We shall seek refuge at the home of the Unnamed!... He has converted now!... Converted? What if we place ourselves in prison?... Bewildered they abandoned their dwellings with the few items they could save... I am Lucia's mother!... But Your Excellency... shall we be safe here?... What if those rascals came?!... They won't come here!... And should they dare... ... We will be ready for them!... Let us hope they do not come!... But at night, a horde of scattered plunderers... The words of the Unnamed spurred his men, no longer to commit villainous deeds, but to free the oppressed! Whether from principle or that he had made a vow to that effect, he remained unarmed at the head of that garrison. That mercenary army set off to besiege Mantua, leaving the devastation and death in its wake! Applause and blessings hail the liberating squad and the captain. The devastating hordes had passed by; and several bodies were found in the houses and streets along their route... ...And one unfortunate soldier, a bearer of bad luck, carrying an enormous bundle of garments stolen from German soldiers, arrived in Milan... It was the Plague!... ...And the terrible disease spread like lightning through the poor population already stricken by famine and plunder... The shelter where people suffer and die... The corpse carriers!... They have come to take Lucia... I beg you... Have mercy!... He drags himself with difficulty to his house, putting his discomfort down to the wine, the late hour, the influence of the season... I feel quite well!... But I must have drunk a little too much... Vernaccia can have this effect!... Go to bed at once!... Good night, master!... ...A filthy bubo of a livid purple... Griso, I am ill... I noticed!... Go to Chiodo, the surgeon... ...If he's well paid, he keeps the sick secret... Give me a little water!... I will give you nothing without the advice of a physician!... In the twinkling of an eye I'll be back... with Chiodo!... Behave like the gentlemen you are... You villain!... Let me kill that scoundrel!... The following day, he drunkenly boasted of his spoils... Renzo, anxious about Lucia's fate, arrived heartsick at the gates of Milan... The strictest orders had been given not to let anyone enter without a health certificate... The lazaretto?.... A woman came out from the doorway of one of the houses... She was not weeping, but her eyes showed signs that she shed many tears... Do not touch her yet... It is I who must place her on this cart... Farewell Cecilia, rest in peace... You... As you pass, this evening... will take me too... Oh my Lord, let it be untrue!... Is Lucia here?... Are you sure?... Do you think a living person may be found in the lazaretto?... Be prepared to make a sacrifice... I will look for her... I will seek her in one place or another... ...And if I do not find her!... ...Woe betide that scoundrel who parted us!... They slowly searched for Lucia, amidst wretchedness and anguished cries... that replaced the ardour of hope with increasing fear... I make a vow, to renounce that unfortunate fellow for ever, never to belong to anyone else but you! Renzo! Why are you here?... Why?... Oh Lucia!... You ask me why I am here?... After so many promises!... I made a vow to the Most Holy Virgin to belong to no one, but her!... Did you forget that you were bound to a promise?... As a Minister of God, I can release you from your vow whenever you ask me to... Then... then... I do!... I release you from your vow!... You, Lucia, entrust Renzo with your errands for your mother... Tell her that I have found another mother... ...and that I will be coming with this one as soon as I can; and that I hope to find her in good health! Shall we meet again, Father?... In Heaven!... I hope!... ... It was as if, after those two poor creatures were reunited, his earthly duty of faith and sacrifice was over... IN PEACE A stormy night... He seemed to know that the pouring rain would wash away the plague... Sunshine at dawn Look at me!... I am a sickly creature... ... Perpetua has left me!... Lord spare me further misfortune!... That Don Rodrigo!... Dead. Praise the Lord!... My children, if this wedding is to be performed, let us do it quickly!... Yes!... Quickly!... Before the first year of marriage came to an end, a beautiful creature was born... THE END English subtitles UNDERLIGHT - Trieste
