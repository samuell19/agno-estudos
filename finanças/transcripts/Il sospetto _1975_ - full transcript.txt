THE SUSPECT by Francesco Maselli TURIN 1934 Next four, please! - Is that the exit to the square? - Yes, that way. Thank you. Ticket! Bravo! - Good evening. - Where do you want to go? Wherever you want. I don't like opera. They all sound the same. Like sheep. I don’t know about operas, but sheep are not all the same. They all bleat, anyway. Goodbye. We were not expecting you anymore. Giacomo goes to the station at 8:00 three days now, in front of Cobianchi. There was a policeman today. - Are you sure? - Enough to turn to the emergency plan. - I found the letter, but… - Things are getting harder in Turin. They are everywhere, look! I started off in Trapani… The Central Committee in Paris must take that into account. - Excuse me, but aren’t you… - A candidate member? Of course. You are four, aren't you? Four, yes. Closed executive group according to the latest indications. Four comrades, chosen among the least suspicious. - They are smart and… - And hungry. I mean for discussions, clarifications and debates. With all these party line changes… And this last one, from Sectarianism to anti-fascist unity, is hard. You see, they… especially in factories… There is real need. Yes, but… It is exactly because of this… that we need to discuss it. But I… - I only have organizational duties. - This meeting is safer in a train. - There is one at 6:00 am. - You mean tomorrow? Yes, I can notify them now. But, you see, there's the factory. If they do not forewarn them… they will search their homes, and then… And this would have consequences. I realize that. - The other three work in the factory? - No. Only Tommaso and Libero. Giacomo is a student, but he is good. Do you know that we approach many students? Let's hope for the best. Indeed. Besides, Marx was an intellectual, wasn't he? So, we'll meet the day after tomorrow. In the morning, 1st class. - Dress well, wear a tie. - Don’t worry. The ticket costs 17.50 liras, times 4, that's… 70 liras. Here you are! Listen, I didn't find anything for tonight. Do you know… - You can come at my place. - Thank you. But it can't be done. It is against the rules. No. It is an exception, that… confirms the rule. I told him: ''If these guys are your men…'' And him? What did he do? Do you have wine? Yes, here you are! Excuse me. Wasn't there a movie theatre around here? Yes. At the end of the road to the left, is Edelweiss. - Sorry, where is the train to Aosta? - Over there. The one that is turning. Full of new faces! Do you want something, young man? - Give me La Stampa. - It's not here yet. Never mind. Give me yesterday's. Yesterday's? Thank you! On the contrary, when you see your superior… Young man, look, we are painters and we must paint all the lampposts, understand? I just stopped here… Excuse me. Excuse me. Number 44. Carriage. Are you coming? Near the lamppost. That one. Can’t you see we are painting it? We haven't even primed it yet. Go get gasoline. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Is this today's paper? - Yes. What else? They didn't have it in the kiosk but I see that you have it. - What are you saying? - That we have met, remember? - Is it leaving? No, it's another train. - Yes, to Genoa. - Is there time to go to the kiosk? - Wait, let's see… - Less than three minutes. - Plenty of time. - Wait, I'll give you mine… - Don't worry, I'll make it. I'm sure it won't leave. - Can you keep my seat? - Of course. Thanks. Come, what are you doing? Move it, run! Among the first duties of a communist militant in mission is to safeguard his life and his liberty of action against all risks, any way possible. Concerning his life, he does not answer to himself but to the Party and the working class which he serves from his post, as he has accepted, the very moment he decided to become a revolutionary by profession. What's the time? Five o'clock. I'm leaving. Bye. - Have you finished? - No, but it's important. You know it has to be ready by tomorrow? - I'll come one hour earlier. - These Italians! - Do you have friends, Emilio? - No. At least… I hope… Rue de la Bastille! Do you know comrade Resta? - Hi. - Hi. Look, Emilio… You may know that the Party is reviewing the situation of some comrades. The headquarters have informed us that… you might be readmitted. - If you agree, of course. - All right. You were never officially scored out, let alone expelled. We can consider it as a "departure". OK. We need to follow a procedure. You know it, you know the rules. - 1932, right? - Yes. That article was just released. You were among the enthusiasts. You were accused of petty bourgeois democratizing, and attacking the principles of democratic centralism. Intolerance, refusal, etc. OK. Let's start. After departing, you found a job in Bugatti in less than 2 months. Since I wasn't working in our club I had the whole day off. - And those contacts started then. - Yes, but not only with them. With others too. We mean the Trotskyists. So? Nothing. They tried to convince me, and I tried to convince them. Convince them of what? About the Party! The Party line. Which you questioned. At least then. I was only questioning the lack of discussion about the party line. Ok, you will talk about that with comrade Teresa. After this meeting is over. Giovanni, everything alright? - Yes. A disaster, Giovanni! To the Telegraph Office, please. Central Post. To avoid been identified skipped last stage of my route. Requesting emergency method Milan. Place and time specified. New passport urgently for immediate return… Paris. I'm glad the Party readmitted you. All comrades are. - Those two sure knew how to hide it. - At the headquarters? Well, it is part of their job! - Have you finished? - Separate checks, please. To be clear, I'm not a member of the headquarters. To be clear, I understood that. How? Simply because you were not in the… interrogation. Oh, right. Of course… They just asked me to speak with you. Comrade to comrade. After 10 years in the Party I must believe that? On the contrary. After 10 years, you are allowed not to believe it. Well, it's an exam, right? Let's start then. As you wish. But let's make clear that you were the one who called it an exam. Listen. I'm just trying… to get to the essence. Today, "essence" is just a word… It can be used the wrong way. Or don't you know that? It is clearly just a chat. Nothing else. I only want to know the reasons of the disagreement. Well, they obviously exist now! I was thinking for a long time: The Party should discuss its policy with the comrades of the base. That it was necessary for the Party line to be a result of collective elaboration. Then this article was published, expressing this idea. Discipline and debates in a Leninist party. Signed with the pseudonym "Aurora". - You remember, right? - Yes, I remember. It explained that this wasn't generically a democratistic requirement nor a matter of principles, but that, by applying the collective Leninist method we could strongly influence reality. Do you know Pisani, the president of the meeting? Yes He wouldn't let me speak. But since there were other comrades with the same ideas well… two days after that, they summoned me. Was Resta there? No, not Resta. They told me I twisted the meaning of the article and that the article was not clear, but rather, objectively provocative. Maybe it was. - No, no. Maybe you don't remember well. - Maybe. Or maybe it has been two years since then. A testimony on the days of Parma. The resistance of Oltecorrente against the fascists. You know it? Yes. You can say whatever you remember. Whatever comes in mind. We will go over it together. OK - How are things with Teresa? - We spoke and… - It is important for your readmission. - Yes, but… Emilio! They told me you were coming and that you were readmitted. Well, 100 francs for the room. Electricity, gas, water… Another 25. How much do you spend on food? Let's say 200 francs. At "Pierre", right? At Rue della Roquette? Yes, at "Pierre". Let's add another 50 francs, for other expenses. It sums up to… 375 francs. Well, in Bugatti you earn… 230 francs. If you add up extras, you may reach 300 francs. We still miss 75. What do you mean? That OVRA (secret police) are paying me? Thank you. Goodbye. Well, if we continue like this… - It is pointless. - You are right. I told him… - Tomorrow at 17:00. - OK. I will arrange it. When we have the photo, it takes 24 hours for the passport. - Let's go back to Turin. - I applied the regulation: When suspicious, you must protect yourself. Was the station guarded? Where those painters policemen? I have no proof that it was a set-up. Neither for the policeman in front of Cobianchi. I have come up with such coincidences in Cerignola, in Molfetta… …in Reggio Emilia. Yet… Yes, I've been informed… you did a good job in these cities. But there was something in Turin. I sensed it straight away… Something was wrong, indeed! When did you arrange the meeting with those four? One day before. That is at night, for the morning two days after. It was the only way. Two of them were working at the factory and they needed permission. You have no idea how many Police stations you can visit in 24 hours. I told you. Two of them were workers. They cannot take a day off without prior notification. Furthermore, we are talking about comrades. Comrades may be comrades, but they may also be spies. Not because comrades are bad, but because spies are good. They know their job very well. -How many people knew about the meeting? -Only the four executives. The same people who were waiting in the train to Aosta. Well, let us assume… that one of them was the spy. It can't be Gavino Pintus. I slept at his place. He could have me arrested. But you said you did everything by the book. Rules apply according to the situations. Sometimes they are confounded with fatigue. If your assumption is correct, - the suspects are three, not four. - Never said that. If you're right, then why hasn't he turned the others in yet? To stay undercover. To continue controlling or even directing our work. Or maybe because he was expecting someone. Someone important. An executive. Someone from the Foreign Cell. Someone like you. Yes, this makes sense. Six o'clock, at the address I gave you. Goodbye. You've been in the Party too long to be surprised by this tone, this cold, detached, hard tone of certain comrades. Like those in the headquarters. But if you still have many doubts… What exactly are you trying to say? To think about it seriously, Emilio. So? Some comrades feel you are holding something back. - Did you see Teresa again? - No. - But we talked. - Talk again. She can understand you. He told you "she can understand you"? OK, Emilio. I'm going home. Let's go! The revolution, for example. A few years back, the Party said it was imminent. All communist parties agreed. It was the analysis made by… - The International. - Which was wrong. Wrong? Capitalism certainly did not fall… There was no revolution either! Which should have been victorious. That's why they sent the best comrades back to Italy. - They were useful this way too. - In prison? - To the Party. That's right. Useful… - In prison! Even so. But not all of them. I'm here. Never mind if we thought we were preparing people to arise. We did manage to reorganize the whole Party. Everywhere. Including prisons and exile places. Well? Well, nothing. I'm thinking…what did that turn of the '30s cost to the Party. Nearly 1,000 arrests, expulsions of the opposed, exhausting controversy. Add the returns, the criticism, the detailed reports, the investigations … that still last. All right, we will talk about this. OK, in spite of all that, you realize… that even this was useful. The Party has grown. - We'll talk. Now… - Let's talk about socialists. When you were in Italy, in the 30's, did you agree with the line, the directive to consider only us, the communists, the only trustworthy, the only ones to work with. - I will answer… - No, wait. And the socialists… Overnight, we turned them not only into our enemies, but.. Fascists! In fact, even worse than the fascists! They are all part of the same analysis: that of the International, which you called "wrong". The '29 conference establishes that the crisis of capitalism was imminent. That the revolution of the proletarians around the world was about to start… It was correct in that all forces not believing or wanting to revolt would confuse and divert the international proletariat away from the decisive fight against the enemy class. Ιf you know that this fight will take place tomorrow, and you'll win any force which has other programs, is playing the oppressors' game. But it is also clear that, if you do not believe in these two certainties, that the revolution will be tomorrow and we will win, but act as if you do, then the real ally of the enemy class, is you. Breaking the unity of the trade unions in Germany, accelerated the revolution or the coming of Hitler? Sure, the German Social Democrats were the worst. I don't know about them. I know that, in '23 when we chased the fascists in Parma, socialist workers were with us. And not only them! A carpenter, everyone teased because he was religious, died on the first day, fighting by my side! You don't want to understand and I don’t' want to say anything else. So, look… Be careful, because this spirit won't help you return to the Party. You must not lose control. You cannot convince a communist comrade with emotionalism. In a few years, we might be calling the socialists comrades again. But you know the Party! Our members need to examine everything, see things written in our newspaper! One who talks like you, is over. Gavino Pintus, 36 years old, born in Tempio Pausania, Sardinia. Worker in a cork factory. Emigrated in Turin in '29. Taxi driver since 1931. Obtains license through a distant relative who works in the Prefecture. Libero Ferrante, 24 years old. Parents: anarchist militants. Father killed by the Fascists in '23. In '29, on the basis of revolutionary slogans he enters the Party. Worker at FIAT Great Motors. Nothing else. All else is fine. Tommaso Lenzini, 30 years old, born in Turin. Worker at FIAT Lingotto. Wife, an active catholic. Seen escorting her to church, while he stayed outside, with his 7-year-old son. He directed the underground trade union and was very active, trustworthy. He obeyed and entered the fascist syndicate but appears to have become less committed and efficient. There's the fact that he married an active Catholic. Of course! He didn't know that, marrying her would be an indication to his Party… that he could be a spy. Otherwise, maybe… He wouldn't marry her, right? In depends on how much the comrade values the Party. La Rosa Giacomo, 22 years old, from Turin. University student, 4th year in Physics department. Father: porter in a downtown center. Mother: dead. Younger siblings. Two years in the Party, has introduced many students to our ideas. Works in a bookbinding store and gives private lessons. Very active in his field. Prepared, mature. No errors. No weakness. He would seem a perfect type. Too perfect! What do you mean "too perfect"? Too much! Do you trust people who are too perfect? Excuse me! I think you don't know what you're saying. You may try to explain it. I'm keeping these documents somewhere safe. Come, let's have coffee. If we've come to the point of suspecting a comrade because he is too good… Nothing. I cannot explain it. It seems unfair, absurd, wrong! Don't think that I cannot see… the dangers of a certain logic. The inevitable consequences once you get there. But let's start from the fact that, certain deviations, like Trotskyism, weaken, in fact, objectively, the communist parties and thus favor the infiltration of counter revolutionary agents, that is, spies among the leaders. Αnd one spy is enough, one spy only, as long as he manages to infiltrate middle management, to blow up the entire Party organization of a whole region. And the organization, Emilio, is the basis of a revolutionary party, it is the backbone of its ideas. And thus, if in order to save the organization… the Party feels it is useful that all comrades, and I mean all of them, be considered something, let's say, suspicious… Ιf we ask why all Italian political parties, without exception, have been dissolved with the consolidation of the fascist regime, and only the youngest one among them, the Communist Party, which was born on January 21, 1921, has remained active and organized? The answer can be found in an incredible incident 3 years ago! The organization in Germany of the Party's National Congress with all qualified representatives of all underground regional federations. When comrade Lenin was talking about the organization he wasn't talking about forms or methods, but… In Emilia, sometimes comrades asked me if it made sense to risk 25 years in jail only for us to meet, discuss, limit ourselves to deciding the text of a leaflet, do anything possible to distribute it, and then return to discuss it. Well, comrades, I wish I had an answer to that. Comrade, what are you saying? There is a general strike throughout Italy. Insurrection is coming. Today's meeting is to organize the distribution of weapons that arrive tonight in Ancona, directly from a Soviet submarine. Exactly! I assure you it was not easy to explain the importance of our mere presence, of our small manifestο, printed though by workers. Because it meant the continuity of the Party, but it also meant the existence of a class consciousness. The possibility to develop and train workers to become executives. - Without a strategy, a perspective? - With the only strategy belonging to us and the only perspective: Breaking down fascism, and building socialism in Italy. - When and in any way possible. - All right. We thank comrade Teresa for the realistic testimony she wanted to share with us. During the next lessons we will hear still other testimonies, from other comrades, on Italy. See you next Saturday. At 15:00. Yes, the meeting is for tomorrow. We'll have to be there too. - All right, comrades. Stay strong. - You know it changed… Some other time? Hi. - You have a moment? I… - All right. I'm finished. No, since I didn't see you… I postponed it. - Your judgment for me? - My opinion! And now? What's left… is to build socialism in Italy. It's a hard moment. It is certain that the Internaional is setting up new lines. New grounds. This time, in the direction, as you recall, of overcoming sectarianism of any… kind. And this creates tension among the comrades of our leadership team. But we hadn't been talking about these choices for many years. I'm sorry, but you say: "The leadership team" "there is tension", - "these choices…" - So? - Well, it's not a case of expanding… - The Party, is not what it wishes to be. It is what it can be, what it has to be in order to survive. Yet… I see what you say, I am convinced today, but… - There's more? - Yes. Sure there's more. Just think… The decisions, for example. Those last ones, who makes them? A huge organization: the International. Yes, but… The Ιinternational continues to take equally into account its 100 Communist Parties, - 100 different realities. - Among which, one is the most important. The only socialist state surrounded by the largest capitalist powers, besieged from the entire world. If Russia is destroyed, the progress, the history of humanity, will end… Αnd we don't know for how long. Maybe for 50, maybe for 100 years, and then… the oppressed people in Asia or in Africa will see the only state that can help and defend them, being destroyed. That's why hundreds of millions of exploited, now demand that Russians make inhuman efforts, aberrant sacrifices! To resist! Defending Russia is the choice of every Communist. Believe me, everything else… follows. So, a Leninist party has more need of discipline…than of debate …today. - Seems like the title of an article. - Maybe. Why not? Of comrade Aurora. Or of comrade Teresa. It's the same. Teresa, Teresa…God! Thank goodness you're here! The son of Eleanor - is sick again. - Relax. It's all right. - Or I'll have to give you the injection. - Sorry, I have to ask you… your judgment, your opinion is negative or positive? Positive, from the first moment. And not only for me. I don't understand, but… all this secrecy… the suspended judgments, all this kind of work that you've been assigned… What was it about? To test me? To test one of us. Over the last 4 years, 6,000 communists have been arrested. All the executives that have tried to gradually rebuild the Domestic Cell were arrested. All the comrades who left Paris in order to re-establish contacts and organization were arrested. You can't afford that luxury because we've worked… Because we've worked for a year to completely change our technique. We changed addresses, passwords. We selected new liaison officers. Now it's up to you. Look, kids. These are the polar bears. They live on glaciers, where it is very cold… Come on, guys. Let's go on the bridge! Run! Wait! Ιn Turin nothing happened. They have not arrested anyone. So, our guess is right. It was your hypothesis and it was a mere possibility. Which came true since the others haven't been arrested. They were looking for you. And since only four knew who you were… - One of those four… - Three. Or one of the three… Is a spy. This is the passport. Sorry, he's a spy only in the case that there was indeed a policeman in the train that morning. - But I told you that… - That you were not sure. But you were certain enough to protect yourself. We too, need to make sure that those who will come after you, will be safe. Henri Langlois, industrial expert, Brussels. OK… And now… So we know that, among the executives in Turin there is most probably a spy. A spy who can have anyone he wants arrested, whenever he wishes. A spy who can make us lose a city like Turin. Turin means FIAT. The largest concentration of workers in our country. Turin is the starting and end point of any discussion. A revolutionary party would make no sense without Turin. - Turin is important. - More than that. More than important. So? So your mission has failed. Let comrades in Paris be the judge of that. They already have. Do you really think it is possible to organize the Domestic Cell of Italy, without Turin? And do you think that the executives of the Domestic Cell can be in conduct with the executives of Turin, under these circumstances? Do you think this is possible, or not? - Under these circumstances, no. - So, you see? Your mission was to allow the reconstitution of the Domestic Cell. I know one thing. That the first rule the Party teaches, is to not get arrested. It also teaches to ignore the rules when it can be useful to the Party. And in this case? I'll give you an example. If you had been arrested the day before the meeting in the train or at the house of Gavino Pintus, at the door, or in the neighborhood, today we would know that the spy is Gavino Pintus. Since he was the only one who knew where you lived and since it was your folly to go his place. Now, in this case, given the situation, your arrest would have been useful to the Party. Now I understand. This is called entrapment, becoming a guinea pig a smokescreen, if you prefer! How many years do you think I'll get? - It's not certain… - Come on, now. How many? 20 to 30 years if you get caught. I see. You, however… This morning, you… gave me the passport. And this means that you expected me… to return to Paris. And I'll think about it. Among the first duties of a communist militant in mission is to safeguard his life and his liberty of action against all risks, anyway possible. Be careful in choosing appointment locations and in which comrades to meet. It is a proven fact that irrational instinct leads to choosing isolated, peripheral places, with a few people or police. The experience of all the sections of the Communist International - has proven though… - The tone of voice should be normal. Not high but in no way low and circumspect. The practice of thousands of comrades informs us that it is more suspicious when two persons whisper, regardless of what they say… The telegraph code divides words into syllables. According to a table…. You must be aware of the new generalities, which you must have studied specifically and exclusively for the border crossing. For this reason a few necessary phrases have been chosen to study them thoroughly. 1895. By Pedro Pineda and Lucia Melina. Start over. Antonio Pineda. Born in Barcelona. July 7, 1895. By Pedro Pineda and Lucia Melina. No. Start over. For those 231 liters of fuel he will answer me that… it is too late and that he prefers to go by sailboat. And I will tell him that, this way, he will never arrive. Very good, bravo! Now… let's go to the next one. Reggio Emilia. Well, Reggio Emilia… Send the postcard at the end of the previous stop. - Which will be? - Pesaro. Well done. Send the postcard to Borganti Alessio. License plates and stamps, via Solferino. - But no, via San Martino! - Yes, via San Martino, excuse me! - Hi - Hi - Better use the magnifier. - Oh, thanks. Workers' State These are 15,000 Spanish pesetas. Just to show them at the border… then bring them back. These are for 3 months' basic expenditures. They correspond to the average salary of an Italian worker. And these are for the mission. Travels, hotels, unforeseen circumstances… Everything! When you return… I want a full report… To the last detail… - To the last penny. - All right. This is the receipt for the luggage. You will find everything you need in the bag. This is its key. And this is the key to the apartment. 4, Saint Severin str. From tomorrow, no one knows anything about you. No one knows where you are. No one should know how, when and where from you are leaving. Listen… He asked me to tell you personally. Comrade Resta wants to talk to you. There's only a small group of us, executives, left. And we only have one duty: to survive. But the Party is in Italy. It’s the 2000 comrades who are scattered, isolated, humiliated, confused……maybe at our fault. But they're stubborn. They resist! And we cannot, we must not refuse to establish an executive office in Italy. The Domestic Cell. This is the purpose of your mission. You have to restart contacts. Check the new lines of the organization concerning conspiracy. This will make the journey of the next executive possible and less dangerous. This executive will be selected by the Party. He will not decide it himself. - He has the right to risk. - Yes, I know it. - I understand. - Exactly! But after every discussion some things always remain unsaid. Even between us? Even between us. And it is best to minimize that. 44. Who has No. 44? Isn't it like Dr. Silvestri described it? Isolated, simple, away from the city noises. And still very close to the city center. A walk through the trees and you'll be in the velodrome. And that's why it is vacant. People seem to have the frenzy today. An unhealthy frenzy, if you ask me! So, let's see. Key number 7. Here you are. Of course the interior needs a lot of work. Like I've told you. According to the law of supply and demand. Sir? - Sir? - Yes, I came that way. I'm here. You didn't trust me that there are two entrances. All right! Trust is good, but… Here it is. Nowadays such a skylight that enlightens the whole house is hard to find. In the summer, they tell me that you can save electricity. - Sorry, where is the phone? - Upstairs. Even this is indicative of the mentality of the previous residents. Even from the kitchen. You'll see! Sir? Oh, here you're! If you like, you can show it to your wife. - You said three months in advance? - Do not worry. No, I'll come one of these days. Meanwhile… 100… 200… 300. 400…500… 1,200… 3,000. - Hello. - Via Divina Genero 23. Right away. Excuse me… - What is the number of the car? - 14. All right, I'm waiting! - It's you? - Move the car further down the road. I'll be waiting inside. The only way to discover the spy… … is to meet the three of you. One at a time. You should arrange the appointments. You have to tell everybody that I have already met the others. And that I'm leaving. - Clear, right? - OK. Be careful. It is important! Whoever the spy is he must be convinced that this is his only chance to arrest me… - Clear! - If after two hours I still haven't returned it means that I've been arrested and that he is the spy! You came back to be arrested? - So, they can arrest me? - I don't know. - Can one of them be the spy? - No! Then stop worrying! They need photos of those three. Four including yours. Tell them to get them. But the passports are three! Exactly! The spy won't need it. But since we don't know who he is… we need photos from all the executive members. Share them with the others. They are enough to get to Paris. You have to escape when they arrest me. When the spy is revealed, you will all be arrested. Do you have a cigarette? - You're still not convinced? - I was thinking of something else. It is not easy leaving your family, everything, and going to France. Better in France, than in jail. You do you still have that … relative or friend in the prefecture? Yes… he's a fellow villager. A distant relative. Because he might be useful in the early days. Someone working in the prefecture can do many things, do not you think? Maybe. As long as he doesn't know what I'm wanted for. - He doesn't know you're a communist? - You must be joking! Tommaso Lenzini, Libero Ferrante, Giacomo La Rosa. Giacomo? - He is the most suspicious. - But I introduced Giacomo to the Party! - He is a great guy and comrade. - Well, we are all good comrades! Intellectual, middle-class, large family… - poor! How does he manage to study? - He gives private lessons, he works! Oh no, in a capitalist country the poor and honest cannot make it to college! - He brought a policeman in Cobianchi. - But they were not together! - They didn't seem together. - But you said he hadn't seen him! But I have seen him! We save him for the end. OK! These days, you must… come and stay here. It is necessary. Find an excuse…that you have to go to Sardinia, a sick relative … anything! Yes… I'll find a way. - Can you cook? - A little bit. Well, that's an advantage. Well, the first one will be Libero, the son of the two militant anarchists. By tonight we will arrange everything. This way. Come, we're very close! Here, this is Superga. Move on! And have a good look at it! When you get back, don't act as usual every time they ask you. Meaning? Saying nothing! Be careful. There is nothing more beautiful, guys… Let's say it's repulsive. - There are also works in progress here. - It's photogenic, you see! Down here are the tombs of the Kings of Sardinia Vittorio Emanuele II, Carlo Alberto, these are their busts! It 's located in the center of the upper part of the basilica! On the contrary, on the walls… Look how beautiful! In fact, there was a chapel here. And here came Vittorio Amedeo II and Eugene, Prince of Carignano, before the battle to see the positions of the enemy. Oh, well … the light coming from the windows that you see all around the dome sheds light almost all day long on the impressive bass-relief of Cornacchini that is on the altar. But we can't see anything now! I said "almost all day long". Hi. Do you remember? We've met on the train. Do you remember? Well… Excuse me. Maybe I'm wrong. Excuse me. You only saw me for a moment, and you recognize me? Yes. To us… seeing a comrade from the Foreign Cell has become an extraordinary event. - Something rare. - And so? And so it is hard to go on like this. Well… I mean… without seeing each other, without discussions. Receiving directives every now and then that… may have nothing to do with our problems! There are dozens, hundreds of comrades who have been arrested trying to come here… to discuss! But the fact remains that … for us, in short… Try and understand! There are many problems. - Many. It's not easy! - OK. They will be in the report, right? Yes, but … is it true that you are leaving straight away? I'll give them the reports. You'll get directives and explanations. Yes, but… I mean… For example… - The new unified line… - Did you bring the photos? Of course. You've put them in here? - Yes, but we won't talk about…? - You'll get everything from Paris. Don't worry. Bye. Listen! One minute! Excuse me … Ten minutes only, sorry! I don't want to delay you. It's about an advice. For the workshop of Grand Motors. There are discussions in the department… Important discussions… On the new unified line. If there are still sectary comrades, you do not have arguments to convince them.. Indeed! The thing is that… they are very serious comrades. We need to discuss with them profoundly. In short… I believe in the new line. It 's just that here, for many years … But, yes… Of course… Let's sit here. It doesn't surprise me that they recognized you. All three of them were on the train. Did he understand that you suspect him? I don't know! And when did you realize that he wasn't the spy? When I was not arrested. I will have to find a deputy executive… as good and smart as he is. The second one now. Tommaso… You'll see him tomorrow. He is serious, a nice guy. I'm 40 years old. It seems I'll get 20 years imprisonment. I'll be 60. And then? Then, there might still be fascism. I don't like… suspecting comrades. If an executive comes from abroad… But, you are an executive! Me? Well, let's say someone… someone important, one… of the five or six persons who are still out of jail. And if you were in my shoes… What would you do? Would you trust Tommaso because he is nice? Emilio, I know them one by one… No, you have to answer me! Would you trust him or not? No. Let's not talk about it anymore! Hi - Hi, Antonio. - How are you? You know Giuseppe, right? You know he was hurt… and since he has no insurance, we have to do something. Hello! We will be safe if we take one of these. - Have you ever used a canoe before? - No. It's only a matter of balance. I'll get them. Wait a minute. Angelo! Angelo! - This one is free, right? - No. It's already taken … Only for half an hour. Come on, Tommaso, you know … If it was free I'd give it to you. Never mind! Nothing. We'll have to wait. I'm sorry. Usually they are available, but … this one is taken, that one just left. Do you have time? - No, I don't. - I see. I'm really sorry. I assure you that, every morning… - there is one available. - You already said that. Over the head. All together, all eight of you. Like that! We can sit here. Let's sit. It's less safe, of course. Tommaso! Giancarlo said he won't use the boat. - You can have it. - This is so kind, thank you. Look, let's face it … You're the one who decides where we'll go. Anyway, you understood. You are the one to decide about everything. - Did you bring the report? - Yes. And then I told him about the Egyptian Museum. And the appointment time. And it was at that point when he started. He said it was safer around the closing time of the museum, and that you need to be very exact in these things. In the museum, for example… He wanted to fix the exact place of your meeting. On the left, as you enter, in the back, where there is the great Pharaoh. And then again those questions. He asked what was the point in you meeting alone. Only you and him. He said: "I can give the report to you and then you can deliver it to him." Then he wanted to know if you had already met Libero and Tomasso. Well, it is ready! He will come by later. The head of the new Board of Deputies. He continued to the end with this controversy, this distrust. It was as if we were ambushing him and not the other way round. Listening to him talk, one would conclude that the spy… is either you or me. It's the comrade from the new Board. - Are you coming? - Me? No. Are you sure Giacomo doesn't know him? No. He's from the department… of Grand Motors. A Cell under formation. He's new in the Party. Since when? Seven months. And can you trust him? All I know is that Giacomo doesn't know him. Do you remember everything for the Foreign Cell of Paris? Yes. Repeat the address. 21, Prevert Avenue. … in Parfums de France. The report must be clear. No personal comments. Just facts. If they ask you about me… Nothing… About the money… The administrator is strict. He wants to know how they were spent and why. OK! I think we've said everything. There's a comrade in Paris, called Teresa. She was called Aurora in Italy. I think she worked in Turin for a while. If you need anything… you can look for her. Should I tell her something? Give her my regards. Good night. Taxi! Gavino! He's here. Bastard! Bastard! You had all three of them arrested. Libero, Tommaso… Giacomo was arrested an hour ago. - All the executives have been arrested. - Take him away! You did a good job, asshole! Are you happy? Are you? I am a militant of the Italian Communist Party. I have nothing else to say. Stop, guys. Is this a way to treat someone who helped us arrest all four communist Executives of Turin? Take him away! I'm sorry, you know… On the other hand, they can't be aware of our secret relationship. Move it! Let's go! Oh, you're here. They left you all alone? Well, that's OK. I told you that between us… there's an agreement, but… In a way it's more than an agreement. It's true that you failed us. In Foggia, in Cerignola. Then in Reggio Emilia and Vercelli. But here in Turing you helped us do a very good job. And Turin is important. FIAT is here. OK! But how come you became less clever here? All right! Well… It's been three months… …that I've come to know you. When Workers' State published your article, I wondered … ''But who is he? Where does he come from?'' It was a testimony on the days of Parma. Thus, between archives, interrogations… … and the Embassy in Paris… …it wasn't hard to identify the author. And how… out of nowhere… suddenly… someone writes an article in the most qualified paper of the Communist Party and then disappears? Because, meanwhile, the embassy informed us that you disappeared from Paris. You don't think we are good, right? And that we're so well informed. But I want to prove it to you. Here! Look, this is the report! You can read it. Read it! I am a militant of the Italian Communist Party and I have nothing else to say. Very well. At this point… …almost a week after… …we have the twist. We receive… a confidential report from our office in the Embassy. They're not perfectly sure, but they have… …made an assumption… …by certain informants. You had entered… no, how do you say it?… …were co-opted… you… …at the Central Committee. So, we said… "They either got crazy, which is unlikely… or… there is a reason.'' And I… …managed to find… …this reason. Let's make a summary. You never were important. Not only that, but from a point on, you were out of the Party. Then, suddenly, they readmitted you and you became important. And then you disappeared. Where to? In Italy? A quite probable assumption. And where in Italy? In the south? In Taranto, Foggia or maybe in Cerignola or Molfetta? In central Italy? Rome or Reggio Emilia? Or in the north? In Genoa, Turin and Vercelli… These are you most important Centers. At this point undercover agents, station guards, hotels and sound recordings in all Police Stations with all necessary data… but no arrest warrant Eh, no! Because you were fake. You were a trick. Understand? A great trap for our informants. However, there was something new here. We became smarter, more scientific… and so… …as a trap… we used you to get our hands on your organization, which we had been trying to destroy for many years, but… …without success. No point in denying it. And so… …we ordered to let you go… and tailed you. But there was something new in yours organization too. Right… I realized that, when I looked at the material seized in the cottage. I detached the false bottom of the suitcase… And here they are! The new conspiracy regulation. A serious work. Certainly the outcome of an international collaboration. But we didn't pay much attention to that either. Virtuous… During all these months, even with guards, photographs and sound recordings throughout Italy, you did it! You always escaped! Until your last return to Turin. Because in Turin… … which is really important, there's FIAT… I came… …with all the team, the specialists… and all the local apparatus mobilized. It took us some time… But here we are! Cigarette? That's it… as far as we are concerned. But on your part, what was the reason for all this? I'll tell you. During the last years, we arrest an average of two communists per day. This average, as it was expected, alarmed your Party… …and even the International. And what is the conclusion? Everybody knows about the great extension of the network of informants conspired by OVRA in all sectors of the nation. Thus, given that we arrested all the executives and the inspectors they sent from Paris, the Party came to the conclusion that we had spies among its ranks… …hidden in its boards and executive centers. Well… Wherever possible, the Party renewed these boards… establishing a meticulous control, individual, to everybody. But finally… in order to discover those alleged spies… it only had one choice: It had to create a false director… and send him here to meet with all the organizations. And thus… it takes comrade Emilio… it furbishes him, it indoctrinates him and then… all comrades are warned that a head executive will arrive. Did you understand? So, what do you think of this story? I am a militant of the Italian Communist Party and I have nothing else to say. You are a poor guy! You're a loser! They took you out of the shit and cleaned you up. They made you important! You were proud to see your article in the newspaper. But it was a trick! You were proud to make it to the central committee but it was all a scam, a lousy trick! Do you know what will happen to you if you don't cooperate? If I put you in a prison cell with Gavino? He will kill you for sure! Because nobody can take out of his head that you are a spy! But if you cooperate… we will rehabilitate you in your Party. We know how to do it. We will provide you with all the necessary evidence of your innocence. And so you can return there. Free! Understand? Abroad! And as for us, we only want a monthly report. Well? What do you think? - That you are a militant of the Italian… - A militant of the Italian Communist party and I have nothing else to say. You deserve all this, because you are a jerk! They deceived you! They fucked you around! They sent you straight to jail! And, trust me, you'll spend there at least 25 years! But can't you see that they used you? But… I always knew that.
