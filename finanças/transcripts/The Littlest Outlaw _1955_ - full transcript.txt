ANYTHING BAD, SIR? NO, NOTHING. IT'LL TAKE ROUGHER GROUND THAN THAT TO STOP THEM. ALL RIGHT, BRING HIM OUT. ALL RIGHT. GOOD. CHATO, BRING THE HORSE. YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A REAL HORSE AND THOSE ARMY GOATS? CONQUISTADOR? A GREAT HORSE. IS HE NOT, MARCOS? YOU THINK SO? WATCH. SEE. THE WALL JUMP. ALWAYS THE WALL JUMP. THAT IS WHY I BET AGAINST CONQUISTADOR IN THE INTERNATIONAL TRIALS. AGAINST CONQUISTADOR? I WOULD BET MY WIFE ON THAT FINE HORSE. SAVE YOUR WIFE, SILVESTRE. I WILL TAKE MARCOS' MONEY. SORRY, CHATO. THIS BET IS BETWEEN SILVESTRE AND ME. MY MONEY'S AS GOOD AS HIS. I'LL BET ON THE GENERAL'S HORSE, EVEN THOUGH HE'S A COWARD AT THE WALL JUMP. HE'S NOT A COWARD. CONQUISTADOR WILL BEAT EVERYONE AT THE TRIAL. YOU SEE, CHATO? YOUR LITTLE STEPSON KNOWS MORE ABOUT HORSES THAN YOU DO. MY STEPSON'S IGNORANT. WHAT DO YOU SAY, MARCOS? 100 PESOS? IT'S A DEAL. ME TOO. WHAT IS THIS? BEFORE, YOU'D BET YOUR WIFE ON CONQUISTADOR. YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND? MM, LOOKS LIKE. HE NEEDS MORE WORK. WE'LL TAKE HIM BACK TO THE RANCH FOR A FEW DAYS. YES, GENERAL. BE PATIENT. SOON THE DAY WILL BE HERE WHEN YOU LEAD OUR MEXICO TO VICTORY OVER ALL THE HORSES AND PEOPLE AND NATIONS OF THE WORLD. HURRY UP, CHATO. HOW'S MY LITTLE CHAMPION? SO YOU'RE GOING TO RIDE LA SOMBRA, HUH? IF THIS IS WHAT YOU CALL RIDING, YES. LA SOMBRA RUNS LIKE AN OX. WHY, SHE'S A FINE, STEADY JUMPER. LA SOMBRA'S AN OLD LADY. FATHER, PLEASE LET ME RIDE CONQUISTADOR. PLEASE, FATHER. WE HAVE SPOKEN OF THIS BEFORE, CELITA. YOU KNOW MY ANSWER. YOU'RE AFRAID FOR ME TO RIDE CONQUISTADOR. I HAVE ALWAYS TAUGHT YOU NOT TO FEAR HORSES. SOMEDAY YOU WILL RIDE THIS ONE. NOW HE IS TOO STRONG, TOO DANGEROUS. IF I WERE A SON, YOU'D LET ME RIDE CONQUISTADOR. CELITA! CELITA! NINA CELITA RIDES LIKE A GODDESS. TRULY THE DAUGHTER OF A GENERAL. FOLLOW HER, CHATO. AT A DISTANCE. YES, GENERAL. HAS MY DAUGHTER COME BACK YET? COOL HIM OFF. YOU WILL NOT TAKE YOUR ANGER OUT ON A HORSE. I DIDN'T MEAN TO SHOUT AT YOU, CELITA. PERHAPS I AM TOO USED TO THE COMPANY OF SOLDIERS AND HORSES. I AM NEITHER A HORSE NOR A SOLDIER, FATHER. NOW, ABOUT THIS HORSE CONQUISTADOR, I WILL NOT PERMIT YOU TO RIDE HIM BEFORE THE COMPETITION. HOWEVER, WHEN THE COMPETITION IS OVER, CONQUISTADOR WILL BECOME YOUR HORSE. WORD OF A GENERAL? WORD OF A GENERAL. LOOK WHO'S HERE. AH, CHATO. IT'S REACHED OUR EARS THAT YOU HAVE BET ON THE GENERAL'S HORSE. UH, THIS, TO OUR JUDGMENT, YOU'RE THROWING YOUR MONEY AWAY. SO? THERE IS MORE OF THIS MONEY I WILL THROW AWAY. WE ARE, OF COURSE, A SIMPLE BARBER. ORDINARILY, WE DON'T MAKE BETS. HOWEVER, PURELY FOR THE EMOTION OF THE THING, UH, SAY, UH, 300 PESOS? ALL RIGHT, SOCORRO. 300 PESOS. UH, THIS GENTLEMAN HERE ALSO WOULD LIKE TO BET. I DO NOT BET WITH STRANGERS. CHATO, THIS IS NO STRANGER. HE'S SENOR CAMARA. UM, TO REFUSE A FRIENDLY BET WITH HIM, UH, WOULD OFFEND US VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT. 400 PESOS, SENOR? 400 PESOS? YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEAR. HIS CREDIT IS EXCELLENT. ALL RIGHT. IT'S UNDERSTOOD, OF COURSE, UH, CHATO, THE MONEY'S TO BE PAYABLE IMMEDIATELY IF THE GENERAL'S HORSE DOES NOT WIN. HE'LL WIN. THE GENERAL'S HORSE WILL WIN. CHATO, THE GENERAL WOULD NOT LIKE THIS. WHAT THE GENERAL DOES NOT KNOW SHOULD NOT CONCERN HIM. THE HORSE MUST WIN. YOU THINK IT IS WISE TO BET SO MUCH MONEY? CONQUISTADOR MAY FAIL YOU. YOU THINK I'M A FOOL? LISTEN, PACO. IF YOU WANT A HORSE TO JUMP HIGH, LET HIM FEEL THE SPIKES ONCE OR TWICE. HE WILL REMEMBER AND SOAR OVER THE WALL LIKE A FRIGHTENED BIRD. GO ON. BRING THE ANIMAL. ALL RIGHT. CHATO, NOT WITH THE SPIKES. - PLEASE, NOT WITH THE SPIKES. - LET ME GO! YOU'LL HURT HIM AGAIN, CHATO. NO. LET ME GO. YOU UNDERSTAND? AND YOU KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT ABOUT THIS. YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON'T OBEY ME? LISTEN, PABLITO. I WANT YOU TO HEAR THIS, SO YOU KNOW I'M SERIOUS. I BET MONEY ON CONQUISTADOR. A LOT OF MONEY. MONEY I DON'T HAVE. SO THE HORSE MUST WIN. IF YOU TELL THE GENERAL ABOUT THE SPIKES TODAY, DO YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOU? I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU, CHATO. CONQUISTADOR, THEN. IF THE GENERAL LEARNS ABOUT THE SPIKES, THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN TO A HORSE... A BAD SPILL, A BROKEN LEG. YOU UNDERSTAND? YES, CHATO. YOU WON'T TELL THE GENERAL? NO. GOOD BOY. â™ª PABLITO, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH CONQUISTADOR? MATTER, NINA CELITA? HE'S MAKING THE JUMPS. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG. CONQUISTADOR IS FRIGHTENED. WHY SHOULD HE BE FRIGHTENED, PABLITO? WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THIS HORSE? I DON'T KNOW, GENERAL. HE WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION. I MYSELF HAVE SEEN TO THAT. HE'S NEVER BEEN AFRAID OF THE WALL JUMP BEFORE. WELL, AS YOU KNOW, SOME HORSES TURN COWARD WHEN YOU NEED THEM MOST. - GENERAL, SIR? - YES? WELL? WHAT IS IT? WHAT IS IT? HARD LUCK. NEVER MIND. WE'LL STILL WIN. GO AHEAD. PABLITO, I'M SO SORRY. IT'S NOT HIS FAULT, NINA. IT'S NOT HIS FAULT. GO ON. COOL HIM OFF. YOU KNOW WHY I COULDN'T TELL THEM, DON'T YOU? YOU KNOW WHAT CHATO WOULD DO. PLEASE UNDERSTAND. PLEASE. GOOD MORNING, PABLITO. GOOD MORNING. WILL YOU PLEASE SADDLE CONQUISTADOR? THE GENERAL HAS GIVEN STRICT ORDERS NO ONE MAY RIDE HIM. FATHER FORGETS THAT CONQUISTADOR IS NOW MY HORSE. SADDLE HIM, PLEASE. NINA CELITA, CONQUISTADOR IS NOT WELL. CONQUISTADOR HAS ONLY ONE SICKNESS... HE'S AFRAID. BUT IF THE GENERAL SHOULD RETURN... HE WON'T. FATHER HAS GONE TO SAN MIGUEL. BUT IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN, THEN... VERY WELL. IF YOU WON'T HELP ME, I'LL DO IT MYSELF. NINA CELITA, PLEASE, NO MORE. YOU SEE? HE WON'T DO IT. WILL YOU BRING HIM BACK TO THE STABLES NOW? NO. NOT UNTIL HE JUMPS THAT WALL. NO, CELITA, NO! NO. CELITA. GENTLY. GENTLY. MIGHT BE BAD. I'LL GET THE DOCTOR. IT'S THE BOY'S FAULT. I TOLD HIM THE HORSE WAS NOT TO BE RIDDEN, GENERAL. GET RID OF HIM. AND THE HORSE? DESTROY HIM. YES, SIR. CHATO, NO. PLEASE, NO. YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID, DIDN'T YOU? DESTROY HIM. KILL THE CRAZY HORSE. HE'S NOT CRAZY, CHATO. YOU KNOW HE ISN'T. YOU KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM. AH, SHUT UP. BRING HIM TO THE STABLE. CHATO, WAIT. CHATO, PLEASE. PABLITO! HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN MY SON? I SAID, HAVE YOU SEEN MY SON PABLITO? WELL? IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL, BUT WE CAN HOPE FOR THE BEST. SAVE THAT TALK FOR THE OTHERS. WHAT IS IT? TELL ME. WILL SHE WALK AGAIN? WILL SHE WALK? I DO NOT KNOW, MY GENERAL. YES? I'M SORRY TO INTRUDE, GENERAL, BUT THE HORSE, IT'S GONE. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? THAT CRIMINAL LITTLE BOY, PABLITO, MUST HAVE TAKEN HIM. THEY'RE BOTH GONE. YOU'VE GOT TO FIND THAT HORSE. YOU UNDERSTAND? YES, GENERAL. I PROMISE YOU, THEY WON'T GET AWAY FROM ME. DESTROYING THE HORSE WON'T RESTORE YOUR DAUGHTER'S HEALTH, MY GENERAL. IN ANY CASE, COLONEL, IT IS NO CONCERN OF YOURS. HOW THEN? IT'S LATE FOR STABLE BOYS TO BE ABOUT. EVEN LATER FOR A GENERAL'S HORSE. IF YOU PLEASE, SENOR BARBER. CONQUISTADOR HAS INJURED HIMSELF. DO YOU HAVE SOME ALCOHOL OR SOMETHING TO CLEAN THE WOUND? I'M AFRAID IT'S INFECTED. WE'LL SEE WHAT WE CAN DO. IT'S A BAD WOUND, SURE ENOUGH. IS THERE NO MEDICINE AT THE GENERAL'S RANCH? NOT FOR THIS HORSE. WELL, BRING HIM INTO THE LIGHT. UP. WHOA, HOLD IT, HOLD IT. I'LL ONLY ALLOW THE FRONT PART OF THE HORSE IN MY ESTABLISHMENT. YOU UNDERSTAND. EXCUSE ME, SENORITA. WHERE'S OUR GOOD FRIEND CHATO TONIGHT? I DON'T KNOW. ISN'T HE SUPPOSED TO TAKE CARE OF THESE INJURIES? IT'S THE GENERAL'S HORSE. MAY BE THAT HE'S LOOKING FOR HIS HORSE NOW. MAYBE. MM-HMM. IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU, SENOR, TO DO THIS FOR US. IT IS NOTHING. WE'RE GLAD OF YOUR COMPANY. AND IF CHATO SHOULD COME LOOKING FOR YOU, WE'LL BE GLAD TO SEE HIM TOO. IS THAT NOT SO, SENOR CAMARA? THERE, BOY. THE WOUND IS AT LEAST CLEAN. ABOUT INFECTION, I DON'T KNOW. I WOULD FIND A DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY, HUH? THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT. THERE HE IS. HEY, CHATO, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? COME ON, CHATO. CHATO, THE MONEY! GET HIM! GET HIM! LOOK, CONQUISTADOR, THE RIVER. COME ON, CONQUISTADOR. LOOKS LIKE A DESERTED TOWN. MAYBE WE'LL BE SAFE HERE. OOH, HOO! OOH, HOO! IS ANYBODY HOME? IS ANYBODY HERE? OOH, HOO. IS ANYBODY... AY! AAH! AY! AAH! LET ME GO. LET ME GO. NOT SO FAST... FIRST SOME INFORMATION. THIS IS STRANGE... THE POOR BOY, THE RICH HORSE. WHAT'S SO STRANGE? IS IS A GIFT FROM HEAVEN. WHERE DID YOU GET THIS HORSE, BOY? YOU STEAL THIS HORSE, NO? THE BOY DOES NOT HAVE THE COURAGE TO STEAL SUCH AN IMPORTANT HORSE. YOU STEAL THIS HORSE? IT'S NO BUSINESS OF YOURS. HUH. IT IS EXACTLY MY BUSINESS. I AM CHIEF OF POLICE IN THIS TOWN. I'M SORRY, BOY, BUT WE MUST KEEP LAW AND ORDER HERE. COME ON! LET ME GO. LET ME GO! LET ME GO. LET ME GO, YOU! LET ME GO. LET ME GO WITH MY HORSE. YOU CAN'T DO THAT. HE'S NOT A HORSE FOR A WAGON. HE'S A GREAT JUMPER. BESIDES, HIS LEG IS HURT. HE BELONGS TO GENERAL TORRES. LOOK FOR YOURSELF. THE INITIALS ARE ON THE BRIDLE. SO YOU STOLE THE HORSE FROM THE GENERAL. YOU SEE? HE'S ONE OF US. HE STOLE THE GENERAL'S HORSE. ALL RIGHT. HE STOLE THE GENERAL'S HORSE. SO WE STEAL IT FROM HIM. ENOUGH OF ALL OF THIS TALK. GIVES ME A HEADACHE. LET'S HITCH HIM TO THE WAGON AND GET OUT OF HERE. NOT SO FAST... BRING MY SACK OF MEDICINES. AND THE BOY? I WILL HANDLE HIM. HE INTERESTS ME. BOY, YOU BETTER RUN BEFORE HE COMES BACK. THE VULTURE WILL CERTAINLY KILL YOU. HE IS A BAD MAN. NO, SENOR. I MUST STAY WITH THE HORSE. OH. YOU HAVE COURAGE, BOY. THIS MEDICINE TAKES THE POISON. MY GRANDFATHER TEACH ME. IT KILLS EVERYTHING... BUT STUPIDITY! IT MAKES NO SENSE! THERE IS A WAGON, NO HORSE. HERE IS A HORSE, NO WAGON. AH, TOMORROW WE TALK. NOW! NOW WE SLEEP. AND THE BOY? HE SLEEPS TOO. YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE THIS, BOY, BUT BEFORE I BECAME CHIEF OF POLICE, I WAS A BANDIT. A VERY BAD MAN. I BEGAN TO STEAL THINGS JUST ABOUT YOUR AGE. LITTLE THINGS. SEE? NOT BIG THINGS LIKE YOU. NEVER A HORSE. THIS IS A GOOD BEGINNING, BOY. YOU SMILE AT SOMETHING? I THINK PERHAPS YOU'RE NOT SUCH A BAD MAN. WHAT? I'M A VERY BAD MAN. EVEN FOR A CHIEF OF POLICE. A VERY BAD MAN. HMM. WHY DO YOU SAY THINGS LIKE THIS? LAST NIGHT, WHEN MY HORSE WAS VERY ILL, I PRAYED TO SENOR DIOS FOR HELP. SO? DON'T YOU SEE? IT WAS YOU WHO FIXED CONQUISTADOR'S LEG. SENOR DIOS SENT YOU TO DO THIS. ME? AND MAYBE SENOR VULTURETOO. WHAT? ME? THIS IS THE END! WE ARE NOT EVEN WORKING FOR OURSELVES ANYMORE. I'VE BEEN THINKING, LITTLE BANDITO, IT IS BEST FOR YOU TO GET OUT OF HERE. YOU AND THE HORSE. BUT YOU WILL NEVER GET OUT OF THE COUNTRYSIDE WITH ALL THE SOLDIERS AND POLICE AGAINST YOU. BUT I MUST TRY. HERE. LOOK. SOUVENIRS. BEFORE I BECAME CHIEF OF POLICE. HERE. HERE IT IS. HUH? THIS IS WHAT YOU DO. GO DOWN THE ROAD FOR A SMALL DISTANCE, TILL YOU COME TO THE RAILWAY. TURN TO THE LEFT. THEN YOU ARRIVE AT THE WATER TOWER. UNDERSTAND? THERE LIVES SENOR GARCIA, THE RAILWAY MAN. TELL HIM THAT HIS FRIEND THE TIGER SENT YOU. THEN YOU GIVE HIM THIS HANDSOME NIGHTSHIRT. BUT TELL HIM IT IS FOR HIS WIFE, HUH? THEN YOU ASK HIM TO PUT YOU AND THE HORSE ON THE TRAIN AND TAKE YOU MILES AWAY. THANK YOU, SENOR TIGER. YOU TOO, SENOR VULTURE. YOU MEAN YOU GONNA LET THIS BOY GO WITH THE ONLY HORSE THAT CAN HELP US OUT OF HERE? THERE IS SOME QUESTION OF IT? ALL THE TIME I BEEN THINKING YOU'RE PLAYING CAT AND MICE WITH HIM. GO, BOY. GO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SENORES. SENOR GARCIA? WHAT IS IT, BOY? FROM YOUR FRIEND, THE TIGER. A PRESENT FROM HIM TO YOU FOR YOUR SENORA. WHY? THE TIGER HOPES THAT YOU WILL PUT US ON YOUR TRAIN AND TAKE US AWAY. AH. GARCIA, YOU WILL GET INTO TROUBLE IF YOU PUT THEM ON THE TRAIN. HOW COULD I GET IN TROUBLE? THE STATE OWNS THE RAILROAD. THE STATE IS THE PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE OWN THE RAILROAD. I AM THE PEOPLE. HOW COULD I GET IN TROUBLE? IT'S NOT WORTH IT. SEND THEM BACK TO THE TIGER. BUT THE HORSE? IT'S PROBABLY SOME CHEAP ANIMAL THE TIGER HAS STOLEN. CHEAP ANIMAL? SENORA, THIS IS THE FAMOUS JUMPING HORSE, CONQUISTADOR, THE HORSE OF GENERAL TORRES HIMSELF. THE HORSE OF GENERAL TORRES? WHAT IS THE TIGER TRYING TO DO TO ME? GET AWAY FROM HERE, BOY. AND TAKE THE HORSE WITH YOU. NO, WAIT, IDIOT HUSBAND. THE HORSE OF GENERAL TORRES? THERE MUST BE A LARGE REWARD FOR HIS RETURN. GARCIA, YOU COULD BUY ME BETTER THINGS THAN THAT. VERY WELL. I WILL DO THIS. I WILL GET YOU ANOTHER NIGHTSHIRT LIKE THAT. I'M NOT AFRAID OF THE TIGER. PERHAPS I WILL GET YOU TWO OF THOSE. GARCIA, YOU ARE TRULY A LION AMONG MEN. DON'T WORRY, BOY. I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOUR HORSE. LEAVE EVERYTHING TO ME. OPERATOR? OPERATOR, PLEASE, THE RANCH OF GENERAL TORRES. THIS IS AN EMERGENCY. YES. YES, GENERAL. I UNDERSTAND. WHEN THE TRAIN ARRIVES AT SAN JUAN, I WILL MEET A SENOR CHATO, YOU SAID? AND, UH, HE WILL BRING THE REWARD? THANK YOU, GENERAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ARE YOU FROM GENERAL TORRES? YES, I'M FROM GENERAL TORRES, AND I DEMAND THAT... STOP DEMANDING AND LISTEN. THERE IS NO TIME TO ARGUE. THE TRAIN WILL LEAVE IMMEDIATELY. WHERE IS MY REWARD MONEY? YOU IDIOT. THERE WILL BE NO MONEY FROM ME UNTIL I... HEY! HEY, WAIT! IT'S MOVING! I TOLD YOU. THE TRAIN WILL NOT STOP AGAIN UNTIL SAN MIGUEL. TILL SAN MIGUEL? HERE. THIS IS THE LOAD FOR SAN MIGUEL. WELL, COME ON. LET'S GET THEM OUT OF HERE. WHOA, VACA, VACA, HO. â™ª THAT HORSE, IS HE A JUMPER? HE CANNOT JUMP. HE'S LAME. YOU KNOW, I SWEAR I'VE SEEN THAT HORSE IN MEXICO CITY. ALMIGHTY FATHER, WE BLESS THESE ANIMALS FOR ALL THEY HAVE DONE FOR US, IN SUPPLYING OUR FOOD, IN CARRYING OUR BURDENS, IN PROVIDING COMPANIONSHIP AND SERVICE TO MAN SINCE THE WORLD BEGAN. FRIENDS, WE HERE TODAY ARE ESPECIALLY FORTUNATE, FOR THIS IS THE FEAST DAY OF THE GOOD SAINT ANTHONY, THE PATRON SAINT OF THE BLESSING OF THE ANIMALS. AND MAY THE FIESTA IN HIS HONOR BE A HAPPY ONE, AND MAY THERE BE MUCH REJOICING. GOD BLESS YOU. NOMINE PATRIS, ET FILII, ET SPIRITUS SANCTI. â™ª CONQUISTADOR, I'M SO HUNGRY I COULD EAT A HORSE. UH, I MEAN A COW. I'M SORRY. I'M SO HUNGRY I COULD EAT A COW. PERHAPS SOMEONE IN THE MARKET WILL LET US WORK FOR OUR BREAKFAST. HYAH, BURRO. AAH. PABLITO! GOD GIVES YOU THIS WOMAN TO BE HER GENEROUS PROVIDER AND PROTECTOR, AND OFFER YOUR STRENGTH TO SUPPORT FOR HER WEAKNESS. LOVE NO ONE WITH MORE DEVOTION THAN YOUR HUSBAND. YOU'RE ENTRUSTED WITH THE... WITH THE HONOR OF HIS HOME AND HIS NAME. BOTH BE DILIGENT IN COMPLIANCE OF YOUR DUTIES AND IN THE FEAR OF GOD, AND HE WILL BLESS YOU ON EARTH AND WILL REWARD YOU IN HEAVEN WITH ETERNAL HAPPINESS. GOD BLESS YOU. YES. GOD BLESS YOU. YOU MAY GO. WHAT IS ALL THIS? THIS BUSINESS OF A HORSE IN CHURCH. PLEASE, FATHER. WE HAVE NO PLACE TO GO. POLICE ARE LOOKING FOR THE HORSE. THEY'LL KILL HIM. YEAH, BUT A HORSE IN CHURCH? A COMMON HORSE? HE IS NOT COMMON, FATHER. HE IS BLESSED, BY YOU YOURSELF THIS MORNING. PLEASE DO NOT TURN US OUT, FATHER. JUST A MOMENT, NOW. WELL, OF COURSE. IF THE HORSE IS BLESSED, THAT MAY MAKE IT ALL RIGHT. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE'S NEVER BEEN A HORSE IN CHURCH BEFORE, AND... HOW DO I KNOW THERE'S NEVER BEEN A HORSE IN CHURCH BEFORE? I'VE HARDLY EVER BEEN OUT OF THIS VILLAGE. MAYBE THOUSANDS OF HORSES HAVE BEEN IN CHURCH BEFORE. BESIDES, IN THE CHRISTMAS PAGEANT, DOESN'T MOTHER CHURCH PERMIT THE OX AND THE BURRO TO STAND BESIDE THE HOLY CHILD? HUH? YOU KNOW, THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS SITUATION. I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH YOU AND WITH THE HORSE. IT'S QUITE THE PROBLEM, YOU KNOW. AND ON THE OTHER HAND, WHAT ARE THE PEOPLE IN MY CHURCH GONNA SAY? 'CAUSING ALL THIS COMMOTION AND EVERYTHING. HEY, COME HERE. COME HERE. IS THAT THE MAN WHO WANTS TO KILL YOUR HORSE? YES, FATHER. WELL, YOU LEAVE HIM TO ME. YOU BETTER GO IN THAT ROOM WITH THE HORSE. COME IN, COME IN. WELCOME, WELCOME. I'M LOOKING FOR A HORSE. AND YOU COME TO CHURCH TO PRAY AND SEEK GUIDANCE. EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT. NO, NO, NO. I BELIEVE THE HORSE ITSELF MAY BE IN CHURCH. A HORSE IN CHURCH? MY SON, THE CHURCH IS A PLACE FOR PRAYER, NOT FOR RODEOS. DO YOU MIND IF I LOOKED AROUND FOR MYSELF? OH, NOT AT ALL. NOT AT ALL. OH, WE CAN LOOK FOR IT TOGETHER. COME. COME. COME. IT MUST BE QUITE SOME TIME SINCE YOU'VE BEEN IN CHURCH. DON'T BE AFRAID. COME. AS YOU CAN READILY SEE, WE HAVE MANY SAINTS HERE, BUT VERY FEW HORSES. OF COURSE, IF BY THE MEREST CHANCE, A HORSE HAD TAKEN REFUGE IN THE CHURCH, I COULDN'T VERY WELL ALLOW YOU TO REMOVE IT. WHY NOT? SACRED LAW OF SANCTUARY, YOU KNOW? YOUR FACE SHOWS THAT YOU'RE TROUBLED IN SPIRIT. ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO STAY HERE AND PRAY? DID I DO WRONG? I DON'T THINK SO. YES, BUT I LIED JUST THEN. WELL, I DIDN'T ACTUALLY LIE, BUT I DID GIVE THE MAN A WRONG IMPRESSION. AM I NOT PROTECTING A STOLEN HORSE? YES, BUT THE BOY SAYS THEY WILL KILL IT. I DON'T FEEL AS THOUGH I'VE DONE ANYTHING WRONG. YES, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, I... OH, DEAR ME. AMEN. BOY, WE HAVE THINGS TO TALK ABOUT. NOW THAT I'VE HEARD YOUR STORY, PABLITO, I KNOW WHY YOU STOLE THE HORSE, AND I UNDERSTAND. THANK YOU, FATHER. YET THE FACT REMAINS YOU HAVE TAKEN SOMETHING, A VALUABLE PROPERTY WHICH DOES NOT BELONG TO YOU. AH, THIS IS WRONG. I WILL NOT, OF COURSE, REPORT YOU TO THE POLICE OR TO GENERAL TORRES. AFTER ALL, YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH NOW TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG. I'M GONNA LET YOU DECIDE. BUT, FATHER, THEY'LL KILL HIM. YOU DON'T KNOW. BUT, PABLITO, IT IS NOT RIGHT FOR YOU TO RUN, TO BECOME HUNTED. THAT'S THE WAY THE LIFE OF A CRIMINAL BEGINS. AND IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE HORSE. YOU CANNOT TAKE CARE OF HIM PROPERLY. AFTER ALL, YOU'RE ONLY A BOY, YOU KNOW. AND IT'S NO GOOD TO STEAL HORSES, OR ANYTHING, FOR THAT MATTER. PABLITO, YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME WITH THAT HORSE. HE'S NOT GOING TO EAT. CAN'T YOU SEE HE'S SICK? HE VERY LIKELY GOT COLD LAST NIGHT. I'LL GET MEDICINE FOR HIM. I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM. SOMEHOW. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. TOMORROW MORNING, EARLY, WE'LL TAKE HIM TO PEPE ORTIZ. HE OWNS A GREAT BULL RANCH NEAR TOWN, AND HIS ANIMAL DOCTOR IS THE BEST. BUT THEY'LL TELL THE GENERAL. I THOUGHT YOU WOULD HELP US, FATHER. PABLITO, YOU DON'T EVEN TRUST ME, DO YOU? YOU THINK YOU HAVE JUMPED FROM THE FIRE INTO THE FRYING PAN, DON'T YOU? I WISH YOU WOULD STOP WORRYING, PABLITO. EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. COME ON. CHEER UP, CHEER UP. HERE, TAKE THIS ANGEL UP TO MANUEL IN THE BELL TOWER. IT'S TIME FOR THE FIESTA TO BEGIN. UP THAT WAY, HUH? THAT'S A GOOD BOY. â™ª I BELIEVE THE PADRE'S A GOOD MAN, BUT HE WANTS ME TO TAKE YOU BACK. WE MUST GET AWAY FROM HERE. NOW. PABLITO! PABLITO. PABLITO. SO YOU DECIDED TO COME BACK TO THE FRYING PAN. YOU MUST BE HUNGRY. COME. FATHER? YES? ARE YOU SURE THIS IS A GOOD ANIMAL DOCTOR WE'RE GOING TO? THE BEST THERE IS IN ALL OF MEXICO. BUT, FATHER? YES, PABLITO? ARE YOU SURE THEY WON'T TELL THE GENERAL? OH, I WISH YOU WOULD STOP WORRYING ABOUT IT. I KNOW EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR CONQUISTADOR. I FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT MY DOROTEO. DOROTEO? YES, THAT'S THE NAME OF MY CAR. IT IS FAMOUS IN SAN MIGUEL. THEY WRITE STORIES, MAKE JOKES. THEY EVEN SING SONGS ABOUT IT. SING SONGS? YES. â™ª DORO, DORO, DORO, DORO â™ª DORO, DORO, DORO â™ª DORO, DOROTEO â™ª CHUG, CHUG A LITTLE â™ª PUTT, PUTT A LITTLE â™ª KEEP A ROLLING, DOROTEO â™ª DORO, DORO, DORO, DORO â™ª DORO, DORO, DORO â™ª DORO, DOROTEO â™ª CHUG, CHUG A LITTLE â™ª PUTT, PUTT A LITTLE â™ª HOW I LOVE YOU, DOROTEO â™ª COME ON, COME ON. â™ª DORO, DORO, DORO, DORO â™ª DORO, DORO, DORO â™ª DORO, DOROTEO â™ª CHUG, CHUG A LITTLE â™ª PUTT, PUTT A LITTLE â™ª KEEP A ROLLING, DOROTEO â™ª DORO, DORO, DORO, DORO â™ª DORO, DORO, DORO â™ª DORO, DOROTEO â™ª CHUG, CHUG A LITTLE â™ª PUTT, PUTT A LITTLE â™ª HOW I LOVE YOU, DOROTEO THERE'S DON PEPE. DON PEPE. GOOD MORNING, FATHER. IT IS GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. HOW ARE YOU? WELCOME. WANT YOU TO MEET A FRIEND OF MINE, PABLITO. - PABLITO. - DON PEPE. DON PEPE'S ONE OF THE GREATEST MATADORS MEXICO HAS EVER KNOWN. WE HAVE A VERY SICK HORSE, PEPE, WHO NEEDS THE ATTENTION OF YOUR WONDERFUL IGNACIO. AH, IGNACIO. HE'S OVER HERE. COME. WE HAVE A HERO WITH US TODAY. ONE OF OUR GREAT FIGHTING BULL. YOU MEAN HE WAS PERMITTED TO LEAVE THE BULL RING ALIVE? YES, FATHER. SO GREAT WAS HIS COURAGE AGAINST THE MATADOR, THE CROWD DEMANDED HIS LIFE BE SPARED. MARVELOUS. AND SO HE WAS BROUGHT BACK TO HIS HOME, HERE WITH US. DON PEPE, CAN I SPEAK TO YOU A MOMENT? NOW WHAT MUST I DO FOR YOU? MY HORSE IS HURT. WILL YOU PLEASE COME AND LOOK AT HIM? SURE. SURE. IGNACIO. COME, PABLITO. YOUR HORSE IS IN GOOD HANDS. LET ME SHOW YOU THE RANCH. MANY PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE BULLFIGHTS, PABLITO. IT MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE, BUT IT IS, ABOVE ALL, A PLACE OF COURAGE, A PLACE WHERE THE MAN AND THE BULL MEET ALONE IN THE RING. WITHOUT COURAGE, THERE'S NOTHING. I THINK THERE MUST BE A BULL IN THE LIFE OF EVERYONE, PABLITO. AND SOMEDAY WHEN IT COMES RUSHING AT US, THERE'S THE QUESTION... DO WE HAVE COURAGE, OR DO WE RUN AWAY? PEPE, NOW. PABLITO, GENERAL TORRES WILL BE AT THE BULL RING IN SAN MIGUEL TOMORROW. I WILL BE THERE. LET ME SPEAK TO HIM ABOUT THE HORSE. NO, NO, DON PEPE. PLEASE. YOU WANT TO KEEP RUNNING? I MUST. I MUST. ALL RIGHT, PABLITO. THIS BULL IN YOUR LIFE IS YOUR OWN. I CANNOT FIGHT HIM FOR YOU. WAIT. WAIT, PABLITO. WE WILL FIND YOUR HORSE. CALM YOURSELF, PABLITO. YOU STAY HERE WITH ME. DON PEPE WILL FIND YOUR HORSE. CALM YOURSELF NOW. I'M SORRY, PABLITO. WE WILL TRY AGAIN IN THE MORNING. YOU'D BETTER GO TO BED NOW. I WILL PRAY. WE WILL FIND YOUR HORSE. LET US TAKE THE ROAD TO SAN MIGUEL. MAYBE SOMEONE IN THE CITY WILL HAVE NEWS OF THE HORSE. THE GYPSIES HAVE SHARP EYES. THEY MAY HAVE SEEN HIM. WHOA, WHOA. GOOD AFTERNOON, FATHER. WILL YOU BLESS OUR JOURNEY? WHY, CERTAINLY, CERTAINLY. BUT FIRST, WILL YOU TELL US SOMETHING? AS YOU WERE COMING ALONG THIS ROAD, DID YOU SEE ANYTHING OF A CHESTNUT HORSE WITH A WHITE FACE? UH, I HAVE SEEN MANY HORSES TODAY IN THE CITY AND ALONG THE ROAD, BUT I DO NOT THINK I HAVE SEEN THIS ONE. IT WAS A VALUABLE HORSE. A MOST VALUABLE HORSE. I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE THINKING, FATHER, THAT I AM VERY FOND OF HORSES, EVEN THOSE THAT ARE NOT MY OWN. BUT AS YOU SEE, I ONLY HAVE THESE POOR THINGS AND THAT LITTLE BURRO. VERY WELL. THANK YOU JUST THE SAME. FATHER. FATHER, SEE HERE. IT'S A BRIDLE. CONQUISTADOR'S BRIDLE. THE ONE HE WAS WEARING YESTERDAY. ARE YOU SURE, PABLITO? THERE ARE MANY BRIDLES IN MEXICO, AND THEY ALL LOOK MUCH ALIKE. NO, FATHER, NO. I HAVE SOAKED AND POLISHED THIS BRIDLE 100 TIMES MYSELF. AND LOOK... THE INITIALS OF THE GENERAL. MM-HMM. WELL? WE HAVE STOLEN NO HORSE. WHAT IS THERE TO TALK ABOUT? VERY WELL. YOU HAVE STOLEN NO HORSES. BUT PERHAPS YOU FOUND A WANDERING HORSE THAT BELONGED TO NO ONE. AND OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF YOUR HEART, YOU SOLD IT. IF SO, WHERE? AS I SAY, WE KNOW NOTHING OF SUCH A HORSE. UH, HOWEVER... YES? IF I PERSONALLY WERE LOOKING FOR A CERTAIN CHESTNUT HORSE WITH A WHITE FACE... YES, YES. COME ON. COME ON. UH, I WOULD TRY THE PICADOR'S CORRAL AT THE BULL RING IN SAN MIGUEL. IT IS A PLACE WHERE CHESTNUT HORSES OFTEN APPEAR. UH, SOMETIMES. I SEE. COME ON. WE MUST HURRY. IT IS ALMOST TIME FOR THE ENTRANCE INTO THE BULL RING, AND WE'RE MANY MILES AWAY. OH, FATHER? YES, WHAT IS IT? HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN? YOU PROMISED TO BLESS OUR JOURNEY. THANK YOU, FATHER. WELL, PACO, WHERE DID YOU GET THIS ONE? HE HAS SPIRIT. UGH! LOOK OUT, MANUEL. LOOK OUT! CAN'T YOU SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING? WE'RE SAFE NOW. IT'S ALL DOWNHILL. AAH. GOOD DAY, GOOD DAY. AY! â™ª EL TORO! COME ON, BOY. LET ME GO! COME ALONG, MY FRIEND. I BEEN WANTING TO SHAVE YOU FOR A LONG TIME. LET GO OF ME! DO YOU WANT US TO GO AFTER THEM? LET THEM GO. THEY'VE BEEN PURSUED ENOUGH. AND THEN HE JUMPED, CELITA. NEVER HAVE I SEEN SUCH A LEAP BEFORE. WAS IT HIGH? HOW HIGH? WHO KNOWS? MYSELF, I THINK, HAD IT BEEN MEASURED AND RECORDED, IT WOULD HAVE SET A MARK FOR JUMPING HORSES IN ALL THE YEARS TO COME. BUT NO ONE HAS SEEN CONQUISTADOR AND PABLITO SINCE? NO ONE. WE MUST FIND THEM. IT'S NOT GOOD FOR... â™ª I HAVE BROUGHT CONQUISTADOR BACK, MY GENERAL, AND I AM HERE TO RECEIVE MY PUNISHMENT. YES? ONLY I ASK PLEASE DO NOT PUNISH THE HORSE. CONQUISTADOR HAS PROVEN HIS COURAGE. YOU'LL BE PROUD OF HIM AGAIN. THAT HORSE IS NO CONCERN OF MINE. BECAUSE HE DOESN'T BELONG TO ME. HE BELONGS TO YOU, PABLITO.
