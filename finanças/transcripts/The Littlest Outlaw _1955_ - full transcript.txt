THIS BET IS BETWEEN SILVESTRE AND ME. MY MONEY'S AS GOOD AS HIS. I'LL BET ON THE GENERAL'S HORSE, EVEN THOUGH HE'S A COWARD AT THE WALL JUMP. HE'S NOT A COWARD. CONQUISTADOR WILL BEAT EVERYONE AT THE TRIAL. YOU SEE, CHATO? YOUR LITTLE STEPSON KNOWS MORE ABOUT HORSES THAN YOU DO. MY STEPSON'S IGNORANT. WHAT DO YOU SAY, MARCOS? 100 PESOS? IT'S A DEAL. ME TOO. WHAT IS THIS? BEFORE, YOU'D BET YOUR WIFE ON CONQUISTADOR. YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND? MM, LOOKS LIKE. HE NEEDS MORE WORK. WE'LL TAKE HIM BACK TO THE RANCH FOR A FEW DAYS. YES, GENERAL. BE PATIENT.

NINA CELITA RIDES LIKE A GODDESS. TRULY THE DAUGHTER OF A GENERAL. FOLLOW HER, CHATO. AT A DISTANCE. YES, GENERAL. HAS MY DAUGHTER COME BACK YET? COOL HIM OFF. YOU WILL NOT TAKE YOUR ANGER OUT ON A HORSE. I DIDN'T MEAN TO SHOUT AT YOU, CELITA. PERHAPS I AM TOO USED TO THE COMPANY OF SOLDIERS AND HORSES. I AM NEITHER A HORSE NOR A SOLDIER, FATHER. NOW, ABOUT THIS HORSE CONQUISTADOR, I WILL NOT PERMIT YOU TO RIDE HIM BEFORE THE COMPETITION. HOWEVER, WHEN THE COMPETITION IS OVER, CONQUISTADOR WILL BECOME YOUR HORSE. WORD OF A GENERAL? WORD OF A GENERAL. LOOK WHO'S HERE. AH, CHATO. IT'S REACHED OUR EARS THAT YOU HAVE BET ON THE GENERAL'S HORSE. UH, THIS, TO OUR JUDGMENT, YOU'RE THROWING YOUR MONEY AWAY. SO?

IF YOU TELL THE GENERAL ABOUT THE SPIKES TODAY, DO YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOU? I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU, CHATO. CONQUISTADOR, THEN. IF THE GENERAL LEARNS ABOUT THE SPIKES, THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN TO A HORSE... A BAD SPILL, A BROKEN LEG. YOU UNDERSTAND? YES, CHATO. YOU WON'T TELL THE GENERAL? NO. GOOD BOY. ♪ PABLITO, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH CONQUISTADOR? MATTER, NINA CELITA? HE'S MAKING THE JUMPS. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG. CONQUISTADOR IS FRIGHTENED. WHY SHOULD HE BE FRIGHTENED, PABLITO? WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THIS HORSE? I DON'T KNOW, GENERAL. HE WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION. I MYSELF HAVE SEEN TO THAT. HE'S NEVER BEEN AFRAID OF THE WALL JUMP BEFORE. WELL, AS YOU KNOW, SOME HORSES TURN COWARD WHEN YOU NEED THEM MOST. - GENERAL, SIR? - YES? WELL? WHAT IS IT? WHAT IS IT? HARD LUCK. NEVER MIND. WE'LL STILL WIN. GO AHEAD. PABLITO, I'M SO SORRY.

GOOD MORNING. WILL YOU PLEASE SADDLE CONQUISTADOR? THE GENERAL HAS GIVEN STRICT ORDERS NO ONE MAY RIDE HIM. FATHER FORGETS THAT CONQUISTADOR IS NOW MY HORSE. SADDLE HIM, PLEASE. NINA CELITA, CONQUISTADOR IS NOT WELL. CONQUISTADOR HAS ONLY ONE SICKNESS... HE'S AFRAID. BUT IF THE GENERAL SHOULD RETURN... HE WON'T. FATHER HAS GONE TO SAN MIGUEL. BUT IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN, THEN... VERY WELL. IF YOU WON'T HELP ME, I'LL DO IT MYSELF. NINA CELITA, PLEASE, NO MORE. YOU SEE? HE WON'T DO IT. WILL YOU BRING HIM BACK TO THE STABLES NOW? NO. NOT UNTIL HE JUMPS THAT WALL. NO, CELITA, NO! NO. CELITA. GENTLY. GENTLY. MIGHT BE BAD. I'LL GET THE DOCTOR. IT'S THE BOY'S FAULT. I TOLD HIM THE HORSE WAS NOT TO BE RIDDEN, GENERAL. GET RID OF HIM. AND THE HORSE? DESTROY HIM. YES, SIR. CHATO, NO. PLEASE, NO. YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID, DIDN'T YOU? DESTROY HIM. KILL THE CRAZY HORSE. HE'S NOT CRAZY, CHATO. YOU KNOW HE ISN'T. YOU KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM. AH, SHUT UP. BRING HIM TO THE STABLE. CHATO, WAIT. CHATO, PLEASE. PABLITO! HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN MY SON? I SAID, HAVE YOU SEEN MY SON PABLITO? WELL?

I'M SORRY TO INTRUDE, GENERAL, BUT THE HORSE, IT'S GONE. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? THAT CRIMINAL LITTLE BOY, PABLITO, MUST HAVE TAKEN HIM. THEY'RE BOTH GONE. YOU'VE GOT TO FIND THAT HORSE. YOU UNDERSTAND? YES, GENERAL. I PROMISE YOU, THEY WON'T GET AWAY FROM ME. DESTROYING THE HORSE WON'T RESTORE YOUR DAUGHTER'S HEALTH, MY GENERAL. IN ANY CASE, COLONEL, IT IS NO CONCERN OF YOURS. HOW THEN? IT'S LATE FOR STABLE BOYS TO BE ABOUT. EVEN LATER FOR A GENERAL'S HORSE. IF YOU PLEASE, SENOR BARBER. CONQUISTADOR HAS INJURED HIMSELF. DO YOU HAVE SOME ALCOHOL OR SOMETHING TO CLEAN THE WOUND? I'M AFRAID IT'S INFECTED. WE'LL SEE WHAT WE CAN DO. IT'S A BAD WOUND, SURE ENOUGH. IS THERE NO MEDICINE AT THE GENERAL'S RANCH? NOT FOR THIS HORSE. WELL, BRING HIM INTO THE LIGHT. UP. WHOA, HOLD IT, HOLD IT. I'LL ONLY ALLOW THE FRONT PART OF THE HORSE IN MY ESTABLISHMENT. YOU UNDERSTAND. EXCUSE ME, SENORITA. WHERE'S OUR GOOD FRIEND CHATO TONIGHT? I DON'T KNOW. ISN'T HE SUPPOSED TO TAKE CARE OF THESE INJURIES? IT'S THE GENERAL'S HORSE. MAY BE THAT HE'S LOOKING FOR HIS HORSE NOW. MAYBE. MM-HMM. IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU, SENOR, TO DO THIS FOR US. IT IS NOTHING.

HE SLEEPS TOO. YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE THIS, BOY, BUT BEFORE I BECAME CHIEF OF POLICE, I WAS A BANDIT. A VERY BAD MAN. I BEGAN TO STEAL THINGS JUST ABOUT YOUR AGE. LITTLE THINGS. SEE? NOT BIG THINGS LIKE YOU. NEVER A HORSE. THIS IS A GOOD BEGINNING, BOY. YOU SMILE AT SOMETHING? I THINK PERHAPS YOU'RE NOT SUCH A BAD MAN. WHAT? I'M A VERY BAD MAN. EVEN FOR A CHIEF OF POLICE. A VERY BAD MAN. HMM. WHY DO YOU SAY THINGS LIKE THIS? LAST NIGHT, WHEN MY HORSE WAS VERY ILL, I PRAYED TO SENOR DIOS FOR HELP. SO? DON'T YOU SEE? IT WAS YOU WHO FIXED CONQUISTADOR'S LEG. SENOR DIOS SENT YOU TO DO THIS. ME? AND MAYBE SENOR VULTURETOO. WHAT? ME? THIS IS THE END! WE ARE NOT EVEN WORKING FOR OURSELVES ANYMORE. I'VE BEEN THINKING, LITTLE BANDITO, IT IS BEST FOR YOU TO GET OUT OF HERE. YOU AND THE HORSE. BUT YOU WILL NEVER GET OUT OF THE COUNTRYSIDE WITH ALL THE SOLDIERS AND POLICE AGAINST YOU. BUT I MUST TRY. HERE. LOOK. SOUVENIRS. BEFORE I BECAME CHIEF OF POLICE. HERE. HERE IT IS. HUH? THIS IS WHAT YOU DO. GO DOWN THE ROAD FOR A SMALL DISTANCE, TILL YOU COME TO THE RAILWAY.

BUT TELL HIM IT IS FOR HIS WIFE, HUH? THEN YOU ASK HIM TO PUT YOU AND THE HORSE ON THE TRAIN AND TAKE YOU MILES AWAY. THANK YOU, SENOR TIGER. YOU TOO, SENOR VULTURE. YOU MEAN YOU GONNA LET THIS BOY GO WITH THE ONLY HORSE THAT CAN HELP US OUT OF HERE? THERE IS SOME QUESTION OF IT? ALL THE TIME I BEEN THINKING YOU'RE PLAYING CAT AND MICE WITH HIM. GO, BOY. GO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SENORES. SENOR GARCIA? WHAT IS IT, BOY? FROM YOUR FRIEND, THE TIGER. A PRESENT FROM HIM TO YOU FOR YOUR SENORA. WHY? THE TIGER HOPES THAT YOU WILL PUT US ON YOUR TRAIN AND TAKE US AWAY. AH. GARCIA, YOU WILL GET INTO TROUBLE IF YOU PUT THEM ON THE TRAIN. HOW COULD I GET IN TROUBLE? THE STATE OWNS THE RAILROAD. THE STATE IS THE PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE OWN THE RAILROAD. I AM THE PEOPLE. HOW COULD I GET IN TROUBLE? IT'S NOT WORTH IT. SEND THEM BACK TO THE TIGER. BUT THE HORSE? IT'S PROBABLY SOME CHEAP ANIMAL THE TIGER HAS STOLEN. CHEAP ANIMAL? SENORA, THIS IS THE FAMOUS JUMPING HORSE, CONQUISTADOR, THE HORSE OF GENERAL TORRES HIMSELF. THE HORSE OF GENERAL TORRES? WHAT IS THE TIGER TRYING TO DO TO ME? GET AWAY FROM HERE, BOY. AND TAKE THE HORSE WITH YOU. NO, WAIT, IDIOT HUSBAND. THE HORSE OF GENERAL TORRES? THERE MUST BE A LARGE REWARD FOR HIS RETURN. GARCIA, YOU COULD BUY ME BETTER THINGS THAN THAT. VERY WELL. I WILL DO THIS. I WILL GET YOU ANOTHER NIGHTSHIRT LIKE THAT. I'M NOT AFRAID OF THE TIGER. PERHAPS I WILL GET YOU TWO OF THOSE. GARCIA, YOU ARE TRULY A LION AMONG MEN. DON'T WORRY, BOY. I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOUR HORSE. LEAVE EVERYTHING TO ME. OPERATOR? OPERATOR, PLEASE, THE RANCH OF GENERAL TORRES. THIS IS AN EMERGENCY. YES.
