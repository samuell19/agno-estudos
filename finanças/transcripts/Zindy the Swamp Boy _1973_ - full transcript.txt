(peaceful music) (birds tweet) (puma hisses and roars) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) - Stay still, Toribio, I'll have him in a minute. (puma snarls) (Toribio screeches) (puma roars) - Zindy! - Shucks, he got away again. - [Man] Zindy! - Coming! Come on, Cooka. Come on, Toribio, Grandpa must be getting angry. Let's go, Toribio. - I wonder what's keeping that boy. - Where are you going, Toribio? Come back! (Toribio screeches) Don't start climbing trees! Because it's getting dark and Grandpa'll be angry! Come down! It's getting late! Toribio, come down! (Toribio screeches) (peaceful music) (thunder rumbles) - Toribio, you shouldn't go around teasing Zindy. Now, I won't punish you, but get out and find him. Now just look how filthy you are. I've told you time and again to stay close to the shack. We're going to have a storm tonight. How many times do I have to tell you not to cross that river, especially at night? There's a swamp over there. Never do it again, please. - I wasn't alone, Grandpa, Toribio was with me! - Well, that's pretty good company, but remember, it's dangerous out there. - Grandpa, the puma was prowling around the swamp again, and Toribio and I just about got him. - Now, listen, Zindy, that puma is very dangerous. If you miss the first shot, he can kill you. Now, I promise you that very soon we're going to hunt him down and put an end to this prowling. And now go wash those dirty hands, and that little mouth, and that nose. (Zindy laughs) And let's go have dinner, okay? - Okay, Grandpa. (Grandpa laughs) (thunder claps) - Now, what if this storm had caught you in the jungle? Hey, I thought I told you to wash your hands? - That was an order, Toribio, wash your hands. (Grandpa yelps) - Zindy! Now, how many more times do I have to tell you to keep this thing in a box? Now, come and get it! - Yes, Grandpa. Poor little Cooka. Aw, Grandpa, you know Cooka won't hurt you. - I know, but it scared me. - You just scared her, yelling like that. - Yeah, that's what you think. And now we're going to say grace. Come on, Toribio, behave yourself. We're going to say grace. And that goes for you, too. (Toribio gibbers) - Hey, fold your hands. - Thank you, heavenly father, for the food you have placed on our table today, and for the many blessings you have bestowed upon us. Amen. And now we may begin to eat our supper. (thunder claps) Stretch it out now, get hold of both corners. Now put your night shirt on, you never sleep with it. - Is there anything wrong with my sleeping naked, Grandpa? - No, I guess there's nothing wrong with it, son. I just say it for your own good. If you don't want to, you don't have to. - Yes, Grandpa. (Grandpa sighs) - Very well, Zindy, now listen carefully. By the time you get up in the morning, I will have already gone to check the traps, and then to the village to stock up on more food. I'll be gone most of the day. Now, you be careful while I'm away. You know my orders. - Yes, I know, I mustn't go walking around the swamp. It's very dangerous, and I might run across the puma. And I must be sure to feed the chickens, right, Grandpa? - Yes, son, that's right, but don't disobey me. - Grandpa, why haven't we been able to kill the puma? - Because that cat is very clever and requires more than two bullets to kill him. But one day, he'll make a mistake, and then nothing will be able to save him from my rifle! Boom! - Grandpa, why can't I go with you? - There are people in the village who want to do us harm. - Why, Grandpa? - Because they're bad, because they destroy everything. They even destroy one another. For us, the village doesn't exist. Zindy, my child, one day we'll get out of this jungle and one day you'll get to know other boys like you. You'll go to school and learn things and one day you'll live without fear of wild beasts. My Zindy, you are the most precious thing I have. You're my treasure, and most adorable treasure. - Well, then when can I go to the village with you? - We'll talk about that another day. Now go to sleep, Zindy. But don't forget to say your prayers. - Goodnight, Grandpa. Come, Toribio. (Toribio gibbers) (suspenseful music) (birds tweet) (turkeys cackle) (turkeys cackle) Calm down, Toribio. If you get excited, you'll spoil everything. This time, we're gonna trap him. (turkey cackles) Bravo, Toribio, bravo! At last, we've trapped him! (Toribio gibbers) (turkey cackles) (Toribio screeches) Shucks, you let him escape again! Aren't you ashamed? You let him go! Boy, are you good for nothin', but you can sure put away the food, glutton! That's about the only thing you're good for, 100 bucks. The next time I see him, I'll blast him, and you'll go without your dinner. (peaceful music) (ominous tones) (ominous tones) (birds squawk) - [Grandpa] Did you get what I asked you for? - Absolutely everything. Look here. It's all here. How is my godson? - He's turned into a nice young man. - I'm glad to hear it, nine years is a long time. And you have to start thinking about his future. He has to study, return to civilization. Listen to me, Doc. The boy can't go on living there, growing up like a savage. He needs to learn and live with other folks. - To learn? To learn what? I've taught him everything he'll ever need to know. And he can't be any more savage than those people you call civilized. - All right, I agree with you. You know we've always been friends, but I'm the boy's godfather, and I don't think it's fair of you to make him pay for your mistakes. Please think it over. That boy needs other children his own age around, to have a normal childhood. - Now, listen, Sebastian. What I did, I did for him. I'll never forget that day. It seems I'll have to live with it for the rest of my life. (tense music) - Abraham. - What was it? What happened? - Father. Amelia. Amelia. - Coramine, quickly, it's in the cabinet. - It was Marcos. Marcos. Marcos. Ramon Marcos. - [Man] Don Ramon! The doctor is coming this way, and he's got a gun! - I'll wait for him right here. You stay in back, in case I need any help. If something happens, just remember it was self-defense. - [Man] All right, boss. (gun fires) (gun fires) (gun fires) - Search every house till you find the doctor. And when you do find him, don't hurt him. Bring him in, so he can be tried according to the law. - But they gave up searching for you long ago. - Oh, you know better than that. As soon as they see me, they'll remember everything. - But you've got to think about Zindy. - I do, I think of him above everything else. That child is the only thing I live for, believe me. I don't know what I would do without him. - Look, Abraham. If your returned to the village and turned yourself in, I'm sure the court would show you mercy. The law is very different from what it was nine years ago. They'll reconsider your case. You killed in self-defense, they'll understand that, and meanwhile, I can look after Zindy. The child can't go on living there. He's alone and in constant danger, with only you to protect him. You look like you need a drink. - You think one is enough? (Sebastian chuckles) - Carmella sends her best wishes and a kiss for the child. - How is she? - Oh, she's as fat as ever. And she's very anxious to see Zindy. - Well, perhaps she will very soon. - Does that mean you'll give some serious thought to what we've been talking about? - I promise, I'll think about it. (peaceful flute music) (peaceful flute music) (Abraham whistles melodically) (Abraham whistles melodically) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (puma roars) (puma roars) (gun fires) (puma hisses) (dramatic music (puma hisses) (gun fires) - Grandpa, did you get him? - No, Zindy, he got away. - [Zindy] Shucks, that was a close call, wasn't it, Toribio? - Now come on, let's go to the cabin. I wanna get something on those scratches. - Yes, Grandpa. Come on, Toribio. (Toribio gibbers) I just gotta kill him, Grandpa. I gotta do it, he's my enemy. - No, it's my job to hunt down that beast. I absolutely forbid you to ever try it again. Did you finish all your homework? - [Zindy] What homework? - To copy three pages from the book. - Oh, what for, Grandpa? - So you'll learn something. - I already did it. - Well, that's fine, son, because I have another for you. - Another one? What do I want with so many books? - One book is worth 100 shotguns. Well, that ends that. If you can't show me your homework, you can stay right here with Toribio. - Don't get angry, please, Grandpa, here it is. - Zindy, don't make fun, you're to respect my white hair. - (chuckles) White hair? - Yes, the white hair of my head. - Oh, Grandpa, you're not to blame for that. What happens is that sometimes the clouds come down so low, they sprinkle your hair with white paint. - Oh, you little rascal, you! (Zindy laughs) All right, I'll go get some food on the table, and we'll breakfast and then let's go hunt crocodiles. - How about that, Toribio? He's gonna take us to hunt down real crocodiles! (peaceful music) (ominous tones) (ominous tones) (ominous tones) (tense music) There goes one, Grandpa, look! - Yes, I saw him! Come on, you get here in back. (Toribio screeches) I've got him, I've got him! Now, you know the secret. We have to be careful not to hurt his skin, now watch! - Yeah. - I've got him, Zindy! I've got him, look, hang on tight! Hey, look! Come on! Zindy, hang on, look! (laughs) Look, Zindy! Hey, look, I got a crocodile! Zindy, look! (laughs) Look at that! - Get him, Grandpa! Hang on! You can do it, you've nearly got him now! Careful, Grandpa! (Toribio screeches) - Careful now! (dramatic music) (Toribio screeches) (Toribio screeches) Good, climb in. That's it, now take this. - Here, Grandpa. - Yeah. You know, you may turn out to be a better crocodile hunter than I am. - Not really, Grandpa. I still have an awful lot to learn about it from you. - Well, I've taught you to hunt and set traps and above all, never to kill animals just for the fun of it. - Yeah, I know, only when I'm hungry. - Right, but you don't always have to kill when you're hungry. There are other things you can eat. - Oh, Grandpa, I know that killing for pleasure's only done by beasts like the puma. He's the one we've gotta kill, right, Grandpa? - To defend ourselves, yes, and to defend those things that are dear to us, sometimes we have to kill. - What are you thinking about, Grandpa? - Ah, nothing, son. Let's not talk about death, let's talk about life. Everything is full of life. All of the plants, the little animals and insects. Even the fish in the river. We live here, too, and that's why we have to learn to appreciate and preserve life. - But how? - Oh, by protecting ourselves from wild animals, and curing diseases and healing wounds. - I'm glad that you're a doctor, 'cause you told me once that doctors know how to cure all diseases. - That's right, but to cure diseases, we need medicines, and fortunately, our heavenly father has provided us with all we need. - Aw, where are they? - Right here, next to us, in front of us, behind you! Below. Above! (chuckles) Now, don't go thinking I'm crazy. In the jungle, in the forest, in the field and the river, there are medicinal plants. But even though we have these plants that cure all of our ails, there are also great dangers. The forest hides deadly perils. Like... Like that swamp area. (ominous tones) That quicksand swallows up everything. If anyone accidentally fell into it, he would disappear, forever. Dying a slow and terrible death. Never come around here, neither you nor Toribio. Avoid it! Avoid this area above all. I call it the Devil's Swamp. - Grandpa, was it necessary to kill him? - Well, yes, indeed, because we need his skin to sell to earn money to buy food. - Poor thing. - Are you ready, Zindy? - [Zindy] Yeah, Grandpa. - Let's go to the river and take a bath. - But now, I'll race you swimming! - All right, you get the towels and soap. - Soap? - [Abraham] Yes, soap, otherwise there's no race. - Too bad. - Soap, or we don't race. - [Zindy] Hm. (Abraham chuckles) (water splashes) (Abraham and Zindy laugh) - Hey! (Abraham and Zindy laugh) - I'll get you! - I'll get you! - Oh, no. No, let me go! (Abraham laughs) You're tickling me! (laughs) (ominous tones) (peaceful flute music) (ax thuds) (ax thuds) (peaceful music) (birds tweet) (distant gun fires) (distant gun fires) Grandpa! - Here I am, over here! Come here! - What was it, Grandpa, what did you shoot at? - The puma. - Did you hit him? - But of course, look at the blood! And there goes the trail. He's wounded, I can assure you. That animal must be the very devil. Not even three bullets would kill him. - I'll get him, one of these days. (both chuckle) A bite, Toribio, you got a bite! Hurry, get it before it gets away! Look, I've got a bite, too! Oh, Grandpa! - Grab it, Zindy! Come on, pull it out! Be careful, don't let it get away. That's right. Oh, it's a big one. Hey, I think you've got a whale there! (both laugh) (fish sizzles) Now, you're gonna taste fish the way only your grandpa knows how to prepare. - Grandpa? If you left me alone one day, I don't know what I'd do without you. (warm music) Grandpa, promise me something. If for some reason, you die before I do, you won't leave me alone, you'll come and get me, will you? - I promise you with all of my heart that there won't be a power strong enough to keep me from returning for you. - You'll come for Toribio, too? - I'll come for Toribio, too. - And also for Cooka? - Yes. And also for Cooka. Come on, let's eat. (Toribio gibbers) (Toribio gibbers) Hey, Zindy, stop that! Come on, now cut it out. You know, I've been thinking we should maybe return to the village. - Why is that, Grandpa? - Zindy, it's about time you had an education, and go to school like other children, and learn about civilization. - But Grandpa, you told me there are bad people in the village who wanna do us harm. Will you go for more supplies? - Yes, I've got to get in to see Sebastian anyway. We're running short on plenty of things. (sighs) It's such a lovely night, I don't think it'll rain. - Grandpa, one time you told me that when I was 10 years old you'd tell me about my papa and my momma. Well, I'm 10 years old now, and I want you to tell me their story, will you? (melancholy music) - Your father was a great man. He, your mother and I were a happy family in San Patricio. When your parents died, you were just a baby. Barely a year old. That's when I decided to live here with you in the jungle. Zindy, I loved your parents very much. I always felt very proud of them, and I pray that you'll remember them with pride and with love, too. You're an angel. All the good that exists in the world is within you. There's no malice in you, no evil. My boy, always remain the way you are. - Grandpa, let's never go back. Let's stay here forever. Me, you, Toribio and Cooka. - Well, let's not be sad about it. I'll figure out what to do. But meantime, I want to show you something. (Toribio screeches) - [Zindy] What is it? - It's time for me to show you something that will be yours. - Like what, Grandpa? - It's the deed to the property of my ranch in San Patricio. It's the only thing of value you will inherit. - What's this, Grandpa? - It's a scalpel. All of those tools are instruments I used when I was a practicing doctor. - It's very sharp. - It has to be, it's one of the main instruments used in performing an operation. - What's an operation? - An operation is opening the stomach of someone who is very ill. - Then if Toribio got sick, we could open up his stomach? - If it were necessary, we could open his stomach and cure him. (Toribio gibbers) (both laugh) - I'm sleepy. - You feel tired? - Mm-hm. - All right, go to bed. - Tuck me in and tell me a story. - All right, go to bed and I'll tell you one. - Please, Grandpa. Carry me. - I should've known. - (laughs) No, Grandpa! (Abraham laughs) - Come here. - Tell me the story. - All right, I'll tell you one. Now, there was this bunny called Cotton Tails. He and the hunters had put out a trap for him, and this Cotton Tail had a couple of grandchildren who were very curious and one morning, the grandchildren went out in the forest and... May the angels watch over your sleep. (birds tweet) Yes, I know, I've thought about it a lot. It's for the best. I'll turn myself in to the authorities at San Patricio. I pray to God they'll be lenient and the sentence won't be too long. 'Cause I'm an old man and I don't wanna die before I leave some kind of security for my grandson. - You've made the right decision. Don't worry, I and many others will testify on your behalf, and everything will turn out fine. Meanwhile, Zindy can stay with me. You know how much I love the child. I really do, Doc. Even though I haven't seen him since you took him away. - I know. Zindy needs to see other folks, to live like other folks. To be like other folks. Well, I'd better get going, the tide's rising, and it looks like a storm is brewing. (waves crash) - Wait a minute, Doc, I'll go with you. - No thanks, Sebastian. You'd better get on home before the storm begins. I'll see you in town tomorrow. Come and help me push the boat into the water. (men grunt) (thunder rumbles) (waves crash) (suspenseful music) (thunder rumbles) (peaceful flute music) (thunder rumbles) - We better get back in the house. Grandpa will be here pretty soon, and he won't like it if he finds us outside. Come on, Toribio. (thunder claps) (thunder claps) (tense music) (thunder claps) (thunder claps) (thunder claps) (Toribio screeches) (thunder claps) (thunder claps) (Toribio screeches) (strong wind blows) (rain splashes) (glass shatters) (thunder claps) (tense music) (thunder claps) (thunder claps) (thunder claps) (thunder claps) (thunder claps) - Zindy, Zindy! Oh, my god, no, don't let me die. Who will take care of my Zindy? Zindy, oh, my god! - Grandpa! (thunder claps) Grandpa's in trouble, I think. Let's go look for him. Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! (thunder claps) Grandpa! (thunder claps) (thunder claps) (somber music) (Abraham whistles melodically) (thunder claps) Where are you? Grandpa! (birds tweet) (ominous music) (somber music) Grandpa. Grandpa! Grandpa. Grandpa! Grandpa. Don't leave us now. We'll be all alone. Grandpa. I need you. Grandpa! (sobs) Grandpa! (chuckles) (somber music) (melancholy music) (waves crash) Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver from evil, amen. (sighs) We need Grandpa, Toribio. We need him a whole lot. You and I are alone now. Grandpa wouldn't want us to be cowards. You gotta have courage. Besides, Grandpa will go on protecting us. Well, come on, Toribio. Bye, Grandpa. We'll come again tomorrow, so you won't be lonely. (peaceful flute music) (Toribio screeches) (turkeys cackle) All right, you, I bet you didn't think I'd catch you chasing those turkeys around, did you? But I'm not gonna scold you. Come on, we'd better start making supper. It's all gone. Grandpa never wanted to show me the way to town. If Grandpa only knew how much we need food. (sighs) We need a whole bunch of things, Toribio. You don't happen to know the best way to get to town do you? Oh, Toribio, sometimes I wish you could talk. My poor friend. You know what I'm saying, you're all mine. All mine, don't you ever leave me. Poor bunny. You're sopping wet. I wonder if you have a grandson who's waiting for you to come home. Go on, get outta here. (melancholy music) (ominous music) Toribio. I feel strange, Toribio. I'm cold. Very cold. (rain splashes) - Hey-ah! Hey-ah! (thunder claps) Hey-ah! Hey-ah! Hey-ah, hey-ah! (thunder claps) Hey-ah! - Faster, faster! - Hey-ah, hey-ah! Hey-ah! (woman screams) (dramatic music) (horse neighs) (girl groans) - Mommy. - Anita. Anita, go for help. (thunder claps) (tense music) - Help! Help, someone! (thunder claps) - (gasps) Grandpa! Grandpa. Take me with you. Grandpa! (peaceful music) - Zindy. My child. Zindy. - Grandpa, it's you. (birds tweet) Toribio, how are you, my friend? (Toribio claps) - Where's my wife? What happened? - There was an accident, the carriage turned over. - Where's Anita, where's my daughter? - Nobody knows, boss, we couldn't find her. - Oh, my god. Quick, Juan, get your men together, we must find her, hurry! - [Juan] You heard him. Come on, get moving! (suspenseful music) (Anita screams) (Toribio gibbers) (Anita screams) (turkeys cackle) (Toribio gibbers) - Hey. What's going on, Toribio? Just a minute, take it easy. I don't have time to play, there's too much work to do. There's too much work, I said. Well, all right. Shucks! A woman! You gotta help me Toribio, we gotta carry her to the shack. Take her by the feet. - Anita! Anita! I guess you're right, she must've run into the jungle. God willing, she's still alive. We'll need every single man you've got to comb this jungle completely. Tell all your men to get whatever they need. We'll start as soon as possible. - Whatever you say, sir. (playful music) - The poor thing, she's pretty sick. We've got to cure her. What would my grandpa do in a case like this? I know, Toribio, we'll operate on her! We'll have to open her belly. (Toribio screeches) Toribio, undress her. - (screams) A gorilla, a gorilla! - Quit it, Toribio, you scared her. - Is that thing yours? - Yes, he's my friend, and he doesn't like being called "that thing." He's got a name and his name is Toribio Hernandez. - Oh, I'm sorry, Tiribio Hernandez, nice to meet you. - Hungry, I bet. - Mm-hm. - Grandpa you remember when you used to tell me about women? Well, I have one back at the shack, her name's Anita. Her hair's nice and soft, but she's a crybaby! She told me she doesn't like coffee without any sugar in it. Forgive her, Grandpa. I'll have to go to town to buy some sugar, but to pay, I have to catch a crocodile, and skin him like you used to do. I know you don't want me to go to town, but, but what else can I do? She likes her coffee with sugar. - Take me with you. In town, I'll be able to find my parents. - You wanna leave? You don't like it here with me? - Zindy, I love it here! But I know that my parents will be very sad and worried about me. Please, Zindy? - All right, don't be so sad. I'll look for the town and when I find it, I'll take you. Come on now, let's eat. I hope you like my fish. My grandpa taught me how to cook them and he was the best cook in the world. (Anita screams) - What's wrong? What is it, what's the matter? - Kill it, it's a boa! - Why are women always yelling? Poor little Rufina, she wouldn't even harm a fly. Don't yell at her. Grandpa yelled at Cooka once and she went away. Look out! - What? - The fish might jump at you. - Big clown. (Toribio gibbers) - It's been over a year since they were cleaned. - Now you'll be able to sleep better. Zindy! - What is it? - Don't you dare take your clothes off in front of me! - I don't understand women at all. - Hm! - You shouldn't have come. You're still weak from the blow you received. - But I couldn't stay home waiting, she's my daughter. My poor Anita, you've gotta find her. - Don't worry, we'll find her. We'll go by San Patricio and pick up a guide to take us through this part of the jungle. I don't know this area and none of my men have ever been here, either. - You think-- - Darling, we must have hope. We'll find her soon, I promise. (peaceful flute music) (frogs croak) That's from the swamp zone, there must be someone there. - Yes. But who could ever live there? - I don't know, but whoever it is can help us find Anita. (mother chuckles) Tomorrow morning, after we pick up supplies and find a guide in San Patricio, we'll cross the river and start searching all over that area. (birds tweet) - [Anita] Zindy, I'm not going to stay here all alone. I'm going with you. - All right, climb in. (peaceful music) (ominous tones) (suspenseful music) This is no job for a girl. - But you mean you really know how to hunt crocodiles? - Of course, my grandpa and I were the best crocodile hunters in the world. There's no one better, the crocodiles were scared of us. The minute they saw us, they'd run off and find someplace to hide. They know they'd better not tangle with me. (Toribio gibbers) There's one over there! (dramatic music) (Toribio gibbers) Don't get scared, now you'll see what a real hunter's like. (suspenseful music) (Toribio screeches) Help, help me! Help me! - I can't! - What do you mean you can't? Toribio, help me! (Toribio screeches) Hang on, he's taking us with him! Help me! Toribio, give me your hand! Hang on, he's pulling hard! (Toribio screeches) (tense music) (Toribio screeches) - Hit him, Zindy! Hit him hard! (Toribio screeches) Careful! Give me your hand. (yelps) (Toribio screeches) (groans) - Told you this was a man's job. (peaceful music) (birds tweet) Toribio, now you stay here and take care of Anita. You understand? (peaceful music) (birds squawk) (bell rings) (rooster crows) (rooster crows) (rooster crows) (upbeat tribal music) (peaceful music) (distant bell tolls) (water splashes) (bell rings) - [Sebastian] What do you want? Come closer. Don't be afraid. What do you want? I've never seen you before. Is this the first time you've come to our town? What's your name? - Sugar! I want sugar. - [Sebastian] How much sugar? Very well. I guess you forgot how much you wanted. Judging by that sack you have, I guess you must need plenty. Who are you? Where do you come from? What's your name? - Zindy. - Zindy! Zindy, your grandpa, where's your grandpa? - The swamp got him. It swallowed him up. - Oh, my god. May his soul rest in peace. Carmella! Carmella's my wife. Now, don't go away, you wait here, I'll go get her. Carmella, come here! Where the devil are you? Carmella! - [Abraham] There are people in the village who want to do us harm. - Zindy? Zindy! (tense music) - Anita? Anita! Hey, where's Anita? Oh, what a fine guardian you are. Don't pretend you can't hear! Don't cover your eyes, big clown. - Yes, yes, that's right, I know the whole area. - Well, in that case, you can guide us through the swamp zone. - Of course, come on. - Anita! (puma hisses) (dramatic music) - Zindy! Zindy! (suspenseful music) Zindy! - Anita! - Zindy! - Anita! - Zindy! (puma roars) (screams) (puma roars) (gun fires) (suspenseful music) (puma growls) (puma hisses) (puma growls) (puma roars) (puma screeches) (puma growls) (puma roars) (screams) (puma roars) (sobs) (somber music) (peaceful music) (Zindy chuckles) - I killed him. We killed him, Grandpa. (peaceful music)
