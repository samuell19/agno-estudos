A film very, very loosely based on a true story MY VERY OWN CIRCUS BILL THE CLOWN Back from a tour through the stars, behold the magnificent, extraordinary, unique Mr. Bill! And now, the highlight of our show! Listen, that was a great show. The kids' eyes were this wide when they left. Bravo! Truly excellent. We're very satisfied. I just have one small detail to discuss with you. What is it? Well, as you know... times are tough for rural concert halls. What is it, buddy? You are paying our fee, right? So? Well, we only got half our fee, but you know what a skilled negotiator I am. As compensation, I got us eight free drinks... if we come to a show. And here I thought we were in trouble. What about me? What about you? Well... You're my daughter! So? I'm part of the show too. You're right. Let's make a deal. I'll buy you new clothes for school. Yeah. Clown, like Bozo? Don't get me started on that. Because of Bozo and his pals, everyone thinks clowns are just alcoholics in face paint who terrorize kids at the mall. And you? What's your name? His name is Mandeep. But he won't tell you that. He doesn't talk. Is he mute? No, he doesn't speak the human language. No, it's true. As a baby, he was abandoned deep in the Bengali jungle. A tigress found him. She raised him, breastfed him. Yeah, sure. You don't have to believe me. But nothing you know about men has prepared you to tame this wild beast. OK. I don't want to spoil the mood, but can we go soon? Miss Razzmatazz, my assistant. Also Laura, his daughter. Yeah. Who wouldn't mind getting a couple hours of sleep tonight. Let's hit the can and go? Laura, would you mind if we visit Giggles and Galoche when we get to the city tomorrow? Laura, I'm talking to you. Is she sleeping already? Shit! Laura? I'm sorry, sweetie. It's fine. I'm used to it. GALOCHE AND GIGGLES THE UNIVERSE IN A SUITCASE Galoche! You've gotten so big! You look like your mother. I'm working on a new number these days: the fart machine. This one won't do it with me. Party pooper. Real romantic, huh? Helping you operate a fart machine. So, sweetie, when do you go back to school? Monday. But I'd like to go until June this year. For a change. Weird kid, huh? I'm the only dad out there who thinks you learn more by skipping school, and you're not happy. I liked going to school too. Well, since you're here at dinner time, would you like to stay and eat with us? We didn't mean to invite ourselves. Yes, you did, as usual. But we're happy to have you. Cheers! DOG WALKING SERVICE What? What is it? OK, OK! My name is Patricia Dufresne. I'll be your math teacher this year. For those of you who aren't happy to be back in school, just do what I do. Tonight, tell yourself there are only 179 days to go. This morning, there were 180. And by the way, try not to breathe too deeply. They still can't afford to remove the asbestos from the walls. Which reminds me, if you were hoping to sign up for after-school activities, chess club, volleyball, improv, forget it, 'cause there's no budget for that either. OK, open your math textbook to page 3. So, with additional funding and an effective strategy, my business is on the road to expansion, as demonstrated by the market research. Do you have a business plan? Of course. Where is it? Here. May I ask... what line of business you're in? I'm a clown, dear sir. Now that you mention it, I can see that. Thank you. So, if we look at the market research, it's crystal clear that the clown industry is on the verge of enormous expansion. But innovation is imperative. I see. And I'm talking about the artistic and musical expression... of my orifices. Did you know, sir, that I can play Ode to Joy with this... without using my mouth? I'll take your word for it. No need to demonstrate. Why don't you apply for a grant instead? The government isn't obligated to make useful investments. Hi! I'm Laura. I live nearby. Are there any kids here that I could babysit? Not really. I'm the youngest. What? I'm the youngest. Well, do you think your parents would hire me to mow the lawn? I don't charge a lot. Sorry, but that's my job. OK, well... But there's a little old couple across the street. Maybe they'll hire you. Actually, Mrs. Dugas, I'm proposing that you erase my running bill. In exchange, the two of us will perform at your grandson's birthday party for free. Is he really from Bengal? If you spoke tiger, Mrs. Dugas, he could tell you himself. OK. We'll erase your running bill. Excellent. Thank you! Thank you. So, can we start another one? Here. Thanks. By the way, I'm Justine. What? Justine. - Ah, Justine! - Yeah. Hi, Gobzilla! Gobzilla! Stop drooling! Face full of drool. Please, Gobzilla! I don't want to drown in your drool. Shut up! Good night, sweetie! Laura, you poor girl! Why? 93%. You won't be very popular if you bring up the class average like that. Kevin... 32%. Nice effort. Hey, Laura! - You going that way too? - Yeah. I wouldn't like private school. Why not? I don't know. People must be so snobby. Some are, some aren't. I mean, I'm not a snob. Yeah, that's true. And Saint-Pierre has tons of activities. We go on trips. We're putting on a musical. We have improv, trivia club, chess club... Chess club too? Well, this is me. You live in a trailer? Yeah, my dad couldn't go on the road with a house. Is he a sales rep? Sometimes, I wish he was. What is that? It's mishmash. What? It's mishmash! My dad. This is Justine. She lives nearby. - Nice to meet you, Justine Lives Nearby. - You too. I'm Bill. Ran away from the college? You can hide out here. The nuns will never find you. Our teachers aren't nuns. I'm sure they still are dried up old biddies. Yeah. Yeah... Back to the mishmash! The way it works is we dig through the pantry, the fridge, and find the ends of whatever is there: relish, peanut butter, jam... Then we spread it on paper and exhibit it in our art gallery. We call it "post-expiry-date art." Are you girls hungry? At your house, Justine, I bet that when you make a tomato sandwich, you slice the tomato. Yeah. Not here. At our place, we do it like this. Go ahead, Laura. - Ready? - Yeah. Go on! Is it always like this here? Always! Sometimes, we set off fireworks where it's not allowed. We listen to Christmas music in the middle of summer. We cut down a Christmas tree whenever, wherever. We're free! What do you have against nuns? It's not so much the nuns as religion. You don't know what Quebec was like back in the day. Neither do you. You're not 92 years old. Look, it's all the same. Rabbis or imams, I value freedom above all. Religion is the opposite of freedom. There's nothing good about it. Nothing. A lot of people are religious. They can't all be idiots. Why not? TUTORING - BAND - ROBOTICS CLUB CHESS CLUB - YOUR FUTURE - SOCCER How long does it last? Don't ask! Mine never seems to end. No, but how many days? Five, six... Seven? Your mom hasn't talked to you about it? I don't have a mom. She's dead. I see. By the way, don't worry about it. About what? I won't tell anyone you can be nice. Better not. Do you think I'm good enough to get into private school? You want to go to private school? It's a lot tougher than here. Exactly. Well, if you study hard enough for the exam. Can you help me? With math? With everything. Sorry, but I have enough work as it is. I don't have the time. Laura. To answer your question... yes, I think you're good enough. Again? Jesus Christ! GO! MAY YOUR HEART STAY STRONG. Body of Christ. CITY HALL Mr. Mayor! Mr. Gagné! Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor, please. For the listeners at TR Media, Mr. Mayor. Just one question! Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor, please. Mr. Mayor. Who are you? What are you doing here? Bill Bouchard. Clown. Where did he come from? It's just that I'm currently putting together a new tour, and I've been strongly advised to apply for a grant. So here I am. How did you get in here? I'm not just a clown. I'm a magician too. Don't forget the exercises for next week! 51 to 54, page 35. It's important. It'll be on the exam. Have a good weekend. Laura, next Monday after school, come see me in this classroom. OK? I'll put you to work. Whoa, calm down. I changed my mind once. I can change it again. Have a good weekend. - Hi, Justine! - Hi! Bye, Gobzilla! Gobzilla! You must really like that outfit. I feel like you wear it every day. You too. Yeah, but I don't have a choice. You want a snack? Your pantry is... What? It's full! And this is my room! Your clothes are folded. I was at Justine's. I wasn't worried. All we have in the fridge is mustard! Is there any bread left? Yeah. Well, make yourself a mustard sandwich. What's the best part of a ham sandwich? The mustard! So why do we have to put ham in our ham sandwiches? Is it a rule or a law or something? I'm 13, OK? Do you really think this nonsense can go on forever? And I have something to tell you. What? I know. You smoked your first joint. It's OK to experiment, sweetie. You know I'm open-minded. Don't worry about it. I mean, even I've... I had my First Communion. What? Well... I was walking by a church... and they were having mass. I went in and I ate the host. You had your First Communion? What year is this, what century? And you could have picked a better religion, like, I don't know, Buddhism or something! Oh, I get it. You knew going to a Catholic church would make me mad. You did it to piss me off! I don't buy it. This isn't you. Someone influenced you, and I want to know who. I want to know who it was. Was it what's-her-face, with the bike rack for a mouth? Is that it? Was it her? I'm talking to you. Get back here! I want to know who it was! What? I'm trying to teach her some goddamn values! Yes, we got the grant, so we're going on tour. Are you still interested in our show? The 9th? That should work. Let me check the schedule. One minute. Laura, we're in La Tuque on the 8th? No, Mont-Laurier. Shit! We'll never make it to Shawinigan for the 9th. When are we in La Tuque? Laura, help me please! The 13th. Thank you. Would the 14th work for you? We're in La Tuque on the 13th. Great! Excellent! Thank you. I want one. One what? A cell. You're way too young. Everyone at school has one. They're connected to the Internet, but disconnected from life. What do you want it for, anyway? Well, I'd call if I can't be somewhere. Is there someone you need to call if you can't be somewhere? No. Well, OK. But I'll give you this one when I replace it. Good morning. Good morning! Hi! How are you? Thanks. CLASSIFIEDS - REAL ESTATE You don't like our trailer anymore? No, that's not it. But I don't know. Maybe a real house... - A house? - Yeah. We could use the insurance money from when Mom died. It's not enough for a house. Plus there's upkeep. It's trouble for nothing. Yeah, but... maybe we could use the money for something else? Something important. Yeah. Hi, Ms. Dufresne. We were... We were on tour. Haven't heard that one before. At least it's original. My dad is a clown, and... I'm his assistant. And the clown thinks it's funny to make his daughter miss school? I waited for you. I have other things to do. You OK? I failed an exam. Well, don't worry about it. There will be others. It wasn't your fault. No, it wasn't. And you know what? I'd prefer it if it was my fault. I wish I had failed 'cause I was sitting on my ass, 'cause I was too lazy to study! I wish I had failed 'cause I was watching TV or playing dumb video games. I wish I had failed 'cause I'm a screw-up. Then I wouldn't care! But you're right. That's not what happened. It wasn't my fault. What is it? A new lunch box. What did you make me? Look. Pancakes. - Blue? - Yes. But they're not post-expiry-date pancakes. They're clown pancakes. You've never made my lunch before. No. There's a lot of things I've never done before. Things parents do, you know. Yesterday... you were right to be mad. But sometimes, it's like I just see you as my assistant. I just see Miss Razzmatazz, and I forget you're a little girl. My little girl. And I'd like it... I'd like it if you forgave me. If I want you to hate school, I better let you go so you know what you're talking about. But could Miss Razzmatazz still be my assistant for the big show at the park I told you about? You know, the one I got from the mayor. What will you give me in exchange? Anything you want. There's a parent-teacher conference at school this week. Laura, can I have a minute? You'll never guess what I'm doing right now. I'm grading yesterday's exams. 58%. You want to go to private school? You're gonna have to bust your ass. You ready? I'm asking you, Laura. Does that mean you'll still agree to... Thank you. Square root of 196. Hey, I just wanted to thank you. No time for thank yous. Square root of 196. 14. Square root of 144. 12. The verb "forget" in future perfect continuous. I will have been forgetting. Past perfect continuous? I had been forgetting. Yes. Present participle, forgetting. Past participle, forgotten. The Hurons, Algonquian or Iroquoian? Iroquoian. Algebra is the real problem. Obviously, algebra can be intimidating. They all think it's so abstract. But, I mean, it's junior high, not applied engineering. We're not asking for the impossible. Should we take notes? Will this be on the exam? I think I'll take some, actually. Do you have a pen I could borrow? No, sorry. No? And yet... What's this? Now, where were we? Ah yes, make-up classes. I hope we get out of here before my Ritalin stops working. You good? Very good. We play so much, I can see you coming. It'd be nice to play with other people sometimes. Like, if there was a chess club at my school or something. I hope he's being good. I had a chair. Have you seen my chair? You're Laura's dad. Yeah, how'd you know? Not too many students have a clown for a father. Laura's a highly motivated student. It's so rare that it's quite remarkable. Yeah. Has she discussed her project with you? That depends. Which one? Getting into private school. Well, come on! I can't afford that. She said her mother left a little money. I mean, I'm not a financial advisor, but... education is a damn good investment. Public school is fine too. Oh yes. Yes, I completely agree. I've spent my career in public school. We have very good schools. And some bad ones. Your district school is not so great. And you're out of luck. Your daughter deserves to be in a stimulating environment. She deserves to go to a school that has books in its library. So? You met Patricia, my math teacher? Yeah. Did you like her? Yeah. She's cute, huh? Yeah. Did you think she was pretty? I could see you two together. Maybe. I mean, she doesn't have her head in the clouds like you, but that's just it. It'd be a nice change. Sit down. We need to talk. Yes? I see. Thank you. Thanks for calling. What is it? What is it, Dad? Giggles. IN MEMORY OF GIGGLES I'll always do your tricks like you taught me. OK. Are you ready? We have to go. You have to understand, this park project is very important to the mayor. Today is a bit like his birthday. So I want you to welcome the guests, the citizens of our borough, with your little show, before the day's main event: the official announcement of investments in the park by the mayor and his team. So break a leg! Hello! Gather round, children! Bill the Clown will take the park's main stage shortly. Hey, Laura! Hi, Justine! I'm so glad you came to the show! Yeah, I was so excited. Hi, Justine! Hello! How's it going? - Good, you? - Good. Hello! Ms. Dufresne? This is my friend Justine. - Nice to meet you. - You too. This is Ms. Dufresne, my math teacher. Ms. Dufresne is off today, so you can call me Patricia. Perfect. Your dad gave such a great show at the parent-teacher conference, I just couldn't miss today. Ms. Dufresne's just joking. Hey, I just had a thought. Why don't you two get a coffee after the show? Yeah. I can't remember if I have anything after this. No, I don't think so. A coffee, huh? Why not? All of us together? Ladies and gentlemen, back from a tour of the Lower Saint-Lawrence and the Milky Way, behold the magnificent, extraordinary, unique Mr. Bill! Sir... The mayor is ready for his speech, so we'll need you to wrap it up. We agreed to an hour-long show. It doesn't change your contract. We'll pay your entire fee. It's for the kids. It's about respect. - Well, sir, it's not... - What? Who is the park for, anyway? For the mayor and his pals to come play on the swings? You have to understand... Have to understand you want the clown to get lost? Please. The clown will get lost after the show. OK? Until then, scram! - Excuse me? - Scram! And now, the highlight of our show! Go. Hello, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of myself and the borough... I'd like to tell you how proud I am... of our plan for the new park infrastructure, which will, in my opinion, revitalize the neighbourhood and improve the quality of life of our citizens. I've been waiting for this moment for years, the moment where... We serve the cake! Come! There's cake for everyone! A big piece of cake! It looks so good! This is the best cake I've ever had! Daddy? It's you! Give me a hug, Daddy! - Oh no! - Oh, Daddy! You came back, Daddy! You're all prickly, Daddy! Who wants to keep partying? Make room for me! This is an official ceremony! Calm down! It's a show for kids. Let the mayor give his speech. OK, then! Hey, this is an official clown show! I can throw things too! OK, make him stop this nonsense! Come on, ma'am! We may have uniforms, but we're not cops! No, but we're first responders. It's our job to take action. Respond. Bill, take my bike! Thank you, horsekeeper! You'll never catch me! I have a supersonic motorcycle! Watch out! This motorcycle is out of control! - Watch yourselves! - Come here! - Move it! - Whoa, calm down! Ma'am. Hey, whoa! Calm down! Let go of me! Are you OK? Thanks. - You can't be serious! - Remain calm. Dad! May I? You may not want anyone to know, but eventually, people are gonna find out you're nice. This is Mandeep. He's my dad's best friend and assistant. Nice to meet you. Any news? They'll let him out soon, but they didn't say when. I'm sure it's just a question of protocol. If he goes to court and they find him guilty, he won't be able to pay the fine. He'll have to go to jail. He doesn't talk. You're pretty shaken up, huh? I told you, he doesn't talk. Had to happen sometime. Of course he talks. Look. He's not supposed to. He's from Bengal. He was breastfed by a tigress. My name isn't Mandeep, and I'm not from Bengal. My name is Daniel Fradette. I'm from Ville-Émard. You know, my love, your visits... are what keep me going... keep me from descending into madness... keep me alive. I'm here to tell you that you can go home. - Already? - Yes. Go. You're free. Time flies when you're in good company. Bye, guys. We'll miss you, Bill! Not for long. I'll hold up a corner store, get busted and come right back. Later! I feel like I'm letting you in to my secret garden. The turban and the costume and everything was Bill's idea. He wanted me to look different, stand out. And you went along with it the whole time, Mandeep? Daniel. Sorry, that's right. Yeah, I thought it was great. I got a new personality, which was fine by me. I didn't really like the old one. Why not? I used to be homeless. Drug problem and everything. That's how I met Bill. He was doing a street show. He took me under his wing. He trained me to be his assistant. I owe a lot to your father, Laura. You know, he... he's a damn good person. I know. I'm not sure he'd be too happy I took this off, though. He taught me to always stay in character. Well, he's not here. Yeah. While I'm at it, if I really let myself go... I think I'd take advantage of his absence to play out a fantasy I have. Oh yeah? Which one? I don't get it. We're breaking a law right now. Why not? I don't know about you, but I'm thinking a brushed-back look. I feel like it would suit my hair type best. Personally, I think it looks more natural. It's more work, of course, but I looked into it. What you do is grab a strand of hair with your brush, and you pull it a bit, like this. Then, with your hairdryer, you blow hot air on it for volume, followed by cold air so it holds. And then, it's impor-- Dad! It's OK. It's over, sweetie. Guess what? Daniel talks. Mandeep talks. A little, not a lot. She told me you want to go to private school next year. You know what I think. You... Look, I'm not asking you to drop out of school. This isn't 1930. I don't want you to stay at home to milk cows and raise your 13 siblings. But I'm not comfortable with this. I'm not, OK? This isn't what I wanted for my little girl. I didn't want you to become a bratty little private school snob! You're doing this to piss me off, aren't you? Maybe a little. And do you know how much it costs? You said we'd use Mom's money for something useful. Why not this? Are you just gonna leave it in the bank forever? Of course not. 'Cause when we really need it for something important-- It's gone! The money is gone. There's nothing left. Zero. But what would it really change anyway, huh? Look, I don't want a goddamn clown's life! OK? So I get in line at the checkout... and there's a lady in front of me. She puts her giant goddamn purse on the counter and starts digging for her wallet. And it's taking forever. I wanna say: "Ma'am, do you really need such a big purse? "I mean, when you leave your house, do you really think you're gonna need all that stuff?" You know? What? Like I said earlier, she's probably at a friend's house. No, she didn't warn you, but at that age, it's normal to forget that stuff. Especially as you approach adolescence. And if she didn't call, it's probably 'cause she's having so much fun she forgot. Think back to when you were that age, playing cops and robbers and... Are you even sure your phone is working? You're definitely the type who forgets to charge it. And Laura knows that. She might just think there's no point in calling. What are you doing here? I ran away from home. OK... but you can't stay here. Either I stay here, or I get picked up by a street gang who will force me into prostitution in a cheap Toronto motel. Your choice. So, if I understand correctly... if you had coffee with my dad, it would really just be for a coffee. You'd have coffee, and that's it. There's a good chance it would end there, yes. Oh well. Should I get you more tea? Yes, thank you. I'll never go to private school. He spent all of my mom's money. There's nothing left. I don't want this life. I'm sick of it. But why do kids run away? I think, first and foremost, to send a message to the parents. Does the kid want to leave forever? No, probably not. He's saying that something in the family dynamic isn't working. It's his or her way of communicating, of saying: "Hey! I need your attention. Since you won't give it to me when I'm here, maybe you will when I'm gone." It's a way to escape, to... Hello? Hi! It's Patricia Dufresne. I wanted to let you know she's here right now. Do you have a pen? Yes, I can wait. What do you mean, she's gone? It's my fault. I should have kept an eye on her. Damn right it's your fault! You encouraged her, and now she's gone. Listen, maybe if you had encouraged her, she would have stayed. Everything OK? It'll be fine. Hi. I'm Maxime. Bill. You're right. It's my fault. I'm the... I'm sorry I said that. Thank you. Thank you for everything you're doing for her. I'm really sorry. Keep me posted, please. I will. Laura! Yes? Thank you. Go on. I'll be right out. You spent everything, Bill? What the hell is wrong with you? We needed it. Needed it? Why? For your stupid show? What about her? What does she get? Laura? What? They're pressing charges. I'm going to court. And how has the assault affected you? I've been having trouble sleeping, and I've developed back pain my chiropractor couldn't heal. I'm worried I'm stuck with it. Tell us about your skin problems. Yes. During the assault, the accused put an unidentified product on my neck, causing an irritation I have to treat with ointments. It was goddamn icing! Silence, please. This isn't the place to clown around. You gotta toe the line. Did you plan to put these people in a dangerous situation? I didn't plan anything. But you admit you put them in a dangerous situation? Come on! When you removed the staircase, you knew people couldn't get off the stage without risking an injury. I told myself I could put it back later. So it was planned. Ms. Parent... I'd like to remind you you're not questioning a serial killer. Who hired you, Mr. Bouchard? It was a woman. I can't remember her name. The borough hired you. They were your employer. And because they were paying a flat rate, it was up to their discretion to cancel your services at any time. And at the centre of this mess, taxpayer dollars invested in the event. A woman about to give birth was pushed, fell, and could have lost her baby. The police had to be called! Several thousands of dollars in damages. OK. I think we've heard enough for today. Court is adjourned. We'll reconvene on Monday. I don't recognize him anymore. He's weak. He's resigned. I want to do something, but I don't know what. Hey, Gobzilla! Hey, it's Gobzilla! Stop! Stop! It's like you're kissing me! Gross! There's no point anyway. I'm gonna lose for sure. Look, you won't like what I'm about to say, but you sort of brought it on yourself. You've always thought you were better than everyone, and it's catching up to you. A clown is the employee of the person who hires him. He doesn't have a special status. He doesn't have the right to, I don't know-- Daniel, Mandeep. What? Shut up. We can't take it anymore, OK? Come on, Dad. Follow me. Come on! Christmas is still far away, no? Yeah, but we're not like other people. Lately, I get the feeling you wish I was like other people. No. I want you to be... I want you to be you. As long as you let me be me. That's just it. Bill is the one on trial. Not the guy in a tie I saw yesterday. You had an audience, and you didn't put on a show. That's not you. - Let's go! - Take this. Quick, quick! OK, go! I told you to dress sombrely. This is a courthouse, not a circus. No? It's funny. I feel like if I go in there dressed as a clown, it could easily become one. I can't defend you under these circumstances. I'm happy to accept your resignation. Your Honour, I believe everyone came here today believing this was a simple case. "A clown causes chaos at an official event. He's sentenced, and voila!" But that was before this new evidence came to light, most notably a video, captured on-site, in real time, thanks to a cell phone belonging to a Miss Justine Tremblay. Allow me to play the video for the court. And now, the highlight of our show! Ladies and gentlemen... This film offers a clear, chronological timeline of events. So, in 3 minutes and 14 seconds, the clown had time to throw himself in the mayor's arms, serve cake to all the children present, jump off the stage, tear the staircase off the stage and throw it, mount a bicycle, ride all the way around the park, then arrive at the pregnant woman's point of impact. Well, Your Honour, I say it's impossible, physically impossible! For the clown to do all that in 3 minutes and 14 seconds, he'd have to be an Olympian! Or a wizard even! And that's why I'm proposing a new theory to the court today... the theory of the second clown. That day at the park, there wasn't just one clown. There were three, four, five even! I'll say it loud and clear, Your Honour. I'm convinced we have a clown conspiracy on our hands! You won? Technically, no. But I didn't lose. If you'd rather say I won, I won't argue. What is it? No. I'll pay you back, I swear. Sure, sure. I'll take odd jobs on the side. I'll do whatever it takes. I wish I could trust you, Bill. You're right not to trust me. I've always acted like a goddamn idiot. But I want to change. Don't do it for me. Do it for her. God, you piss me off. Good day at school? Yeah... You never ask me that. Well... you must have your most recent report card somewhere? Oh yeah, the one you never looked at. Yeah. It's just that... we have to submit a copy... to get you admitted... to the private school. So, if going there helps you do something serious with your life, well... you'll owe it to clowns. CHESS CLUB OK, well... this is it. Yeah. Break a leg, sweetie. Patricia! I didn't want to miss this. It's gonna be great, I know it. I know it. OK, well, since I'm here, I better go in. I'll go move the truck. So, you've made peace with all this? Yeah, to a certain point. I just don't want her to forget where she came from. TO MY MOTHER MY VERY OWN CIRCUS
