It is here. The evil comes closer, brought by the wind. Anakora! Anakora, where are you hiding? Anakora, come out of your hole, you miserable old witch. Anakora! Your voice is strong, but your soul trembles like a child who fears the dark. You don't fear the dark anymore, do you, old woman? Tell me, Anakora... How was the harvest this year? They're waiting for you, if that's what you mean. Well, then, they should be happy to see us, don't you think? Is the victim glad to see his killer? They're not victims. I protect them and allow them to enjoy my men. All I want is some food... More for my men than for myself. You killed their men and you destroyed their houses. You have disrupted the peace that reigned in Clusium. You accursed bringer of death and disaster! That's enough! I don't want to hear any more. Go away. Get out of here. Leave this place that is sacred to Jove, and may he strew your path with a thousand bloody vipers, you evil person. May I have died before I gave you the power of evil! You seem to be very unhappy with the powers you've given me. I'm half-god, immortal, invincible, and if I choose to spare your life it is only because I am grateful for what you have done. I'll be back next winter, and I hope to find you in better spirits. And do not ever forget... I am still your son. They're coming. Hurry! Come on everyone! Remember, not to the temple this time. Go to the north wall. They're coming. Hurry, hurry! Come on everyone, quickly, they're coming. -Come on, hurry. Hurry! Hurry! They're coming! Why are we meeting them here? There's better cover for the boys to shoot from. I pray to the gods that they're successful. Quiet! Is this all? I've been gone for a year. A year of combat and bloodshed. This is what you honor me with? Four chickens and a piece of cheese. Is that all I'm worth to you? The earth hasn't been kind to us this year. There's been no rain for months. We haven't recovered from your last visit. There's nothing you can take from us now except our lives. Well... there's always the gift of your virginity. However, that is a gift you no longer possess. May you be dam-- That's enough! All of you, go and collect your things and bring them to me, or I'll destroy you all as I destroyed your village. Please, we have nothing more to eat, only bread. We have to get through the winter, please, please help us. Meonio! At your orders, my Lord. Kill three of them. Any three that you like. Yes, sir. It'll be a pleasure. - Dex! - My Lord? Up on the wall. After them. Come on! So! This is your gift to me. A boy who tries to kill me as soon as my back is turned. Well, if this is your offer to me... here is my offer in return. Dex. Collect all the boys of this little bastard's age and kill them. Quiet, you rabble! Now, what happened to your men will also happen to your sons and to the sons of your sons... if they shall ever be. I cannot be destroyed by your ordinary, mortal hands because I am everlasting, and maybe someday you will become the blood of my blood. We can't go on like this. We've got to get somebody to defend us. Pandora, open the niche hidden in the belly of Jove. Don't touch it. A sword. Follow me. It is not a sword, but the sword forged by Vulcan in honor of Jove, and given to Achilles. Its power is great. But only an extraordinary man may wield it: the man who will drive it through the evil heart of my son Nicerote. Where can we find this man? How will we know him amongst so many? Go to Rome. Find the Emperor. Go from the Emperor to the nobles. And from the nobles to the people. And from the people to the slaves. Search even lower, until the sword itself finds its most worthy master, because the sword will choose, the sword of Achilles! I have never seen so many beautiful girls. I swear to you by all the gods. You are very courageous to travel all alone at night. We're going to Rome. To Rome? Are you runaway slaves? Why are we wasting time with him? No, you don't look it. And you don't look like street women, either. Thank you for the compliment. We want to see the Emperor. The Emperor! But the Emperor is god. And god doesn't see anyone who isn't his equal. Who are you? A wanderer, an adventurer, a soldier... take your pick. We could try with him. There's something noble about him. He looks strong enough. You're very kind, and very beautiful. Do you want to be put to the test? My whole life is one test after another. Good. Then help me down. Grasp the sword. That's all? Grasp it. Nothing easier. -Oh! Ah! Ah! We must go on. What muscles the barbarian has, my divine lord. Hm... He's yours, Lucilla, as long as he survives the contest. Oh, he'll survive. He's the favorite. His name is Han, and some say he has supernatural powers. No charioteer has ever beaten him. He's no ordinary man. They say he is the son of a king. The son of a king, and with supernatural powers. A true adversary. You are the only true king, oh, divine one. The others are nothing but crude and vulgar imitations. They await your signal, my Lord. Whoa! Divine lord, they are looking to you. You know what this means. Of course. The race has ended in a draw. I don't believe in draws. To the winner... to the winner! The emperor wants to see more blood. I'm sorry, but I'll have to kill you. That remains to be seen. -Hiya! Hiya! He has a strength and ability, but does this barbarian have a brain? Scipio is the most cunning charioteer in the circus. I am positive he will be my winner. I'll bet 100 sesterces on the barbarian. And I'm for him, too. That's against the rules! Come on, Scipio, think of the money! Bravo. Bravo! You have shown your courage and your skill. Now you must kill him so you can become my first charioteer. This is the end of your Scipio. Give me the money. Give me the money. Why doesn't he kill him? Kill him yourself! Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! -Get on! - What? Just do as I say! Get on. Hiya! Hiya! -This is incredible. They've ridden off together. Find them! Hurry! Don't give up until you have found them! There's a man who's even brave enough to defy the Emperor. Whoa! Whoa! Greetings. Welcome to Rome, ladies. Oh! Oh, Pandora, they're horrible. Please, we must get away from here. You're not being friendly. So pretty, yet so unkind. Unkind people never give, so we will have to take. Keep away! Stay away. Stay away from us! No! - Get away from us! - Leave us alone! Help! Help me! Leave them alone! I'll put another 20 on the woman. Be careful, Claudio has never been beaten. There's always a first time for everything. Anyway, I like the way she drinks. Yes, she does put it away very prettily. Well, on your own head be it. Your turn. It's my money. It'll soon be mine. Don't be too sure! We have no one left there now, only children and old men. And some women, but no young men to protect us. Protect you from what? From an evil, bloodthirsty man called Nicerote. How can we help you? Well, first I must put you to the test. -The test? -Yes, it's a test that-- And another 20. And 20 for me, so you'd better win. Your turn. Your turn. I'm only just beginning. Listen, they just arrested Scipio and that giant barbarian who won the race. Where did they take them? The Emperor's palace, I think. Hey, where are you going? You can't just leave in the middle of a contest. Wait a minute. That's not fair. You won. She's not bad. She's got her. Halt! Nobody enters the palace without the Emperor's permission. Shouldn't we have tried, at least, to talk our way in? The German guard'll never let us through. Oh, it's you. The guards? Yes. -Look. -Good idea. Follow me. Let's go. Two despicable men who have conspired against the laws of Rome. This gigantic barbarian who could've become the Emperor's favorite charioteer has refused to obey our divine lord, preferring to the favors of this court a friendship with a former gladiator who has proved disloyal to the Emperor. That will do, Lucilla! Enough! Condemn them to death. We are all condemned to death, my dear. Where is the pleasure, for me, in one more dreary execution? Their heads will roll? Yes. But I am bored with rolling heads. They will fight each other again... to the death. Let the combat begin! Guards! Execute them! Wait! Who has dared to speak? I have. One of the maids. My lord, the barbarian cannot die. He mustn't. He is predestined. Predestined to do what? To wield this sword, the all-powerful sword, the sword of immortality. If this sword truly has divine powers, then only a divine being can wield it. I am that being. Then you shall wield it. I warn you, child, if nothing happens when I grasp this sword, you'll die with them. Nothing. Nothing at all. Get away! Get away! I! I am the emperor! Your god! Oh, divine one. I command you to obey me! I am the predestined one! Quick, the sword. My hand. Will you come to Clusium? Yes. The sword and you are one. Take it. No. I'll only use it for the right purpose: to help and protect your people. Not to defend myself. Pandora, we should leave as soon as possible. Yes, you're right. And where do you think you're going to go? You'll never get past the city walls. Don't worry about us. We'll meet again in Clusium. What are you doing here, Julia? I lost money because of you, so I'm here to protect my interests. This way. They will never get away, divine one. Never. Alive. I want them alive. Alive! Alive! We could do with some help. Sword or no sword, there's still only three of us. Who do you know? I know two... and they may be here. But who are they? Ex-gladiators like me. That's fine. Ah... there they are. By all the gods, Julia! -Glafiro, how are you? Scipio... -Hello, Festo. Festo, this is my friend Han. Han, this is Festo. The champion archer. Pleasure. And Glafiro, the most nimble gladiator in Rome. Any friend of Scipio's is a friend of ours. -Sit down, friend. -Thank you. Let us celebrate our meeting. These are the two good men you're talking about? No, they're just having a good time. You'll find out how good they are, believe me. To a better time. Better times. Han, Festo here fought for three straight nights in the Circus Maximus and didn't even get-- And how much money did he make on it, eh? How much money did you make? I made money! I remember the time Galfiro... You're heroes and I made -money on every one-- -You and Scipio... -Don't remember the time that-- I don't always talk about money. You don't have any money... The Emperor wants you alive, so I'll just have to tell him that you put up a struggle. Kill them! Don't worry, friend, help is here. You'll all die for your treachery. You'll all die. Don't be so sure! No, Wait, Han. That one I want all for myself. -Ha, by all the gods, we did it. You don't really expect me to believe that talk of magic swords and damsels in distress, do you? It's the truth. Hey, I know you and your truth, too well, you sneaky dog. Let the truth be our little secret. And let's split the take like we did that time in Herculaneum. This time there's no take to split. Believe me. Ha! We'll see about that. We ought to stop a while, the horses need a rest. I know a farmhouse nearby where we can get something to eat. I've been thinking about those women we're going to fight for. I just hope that they're pretty enough to be worth saving. If they're anything like the ones I've seen, believe me, they're worth saving. Sex, sex, sex. Is that all you gladiators think about? Maybe there are other attractions, like gold, hidden somewhere. Money, money, money. Is that all you ever think about? That and sex. Goliath! -Come on, Goliath. -Come on, Goliath. Show us how you split wood with your hands. -C'mon, please! -Show us. Oh, please... Not now, not now, can't you see I'm busy? Go! oh... Please show us, please, Goliath! I've never ever seen you split wood with your hands. All right, all right. You'll have to let me work in peace, huh? -Yes, yes! -Yes, Goliath! Show us! Now the main thing is to know how to pick the right spot. Strength helps, but it's not everything. Hey, you! Why are you playing with these children, when you should be taking care of the horses? One thing at a time, friend. First the wood, then the horses. If that's all right with you. It's not all right. I'm in a hurry. My horses need water now. This is my place and I do things my way, understand? You finish playing the clown for these babies after you've taken care of my horses. What's gotten into him? I am a peaceful man so I'll just pretend I didn't hear you. Don't talk to Goliath like that. Stay out of this, boy. You shouldn't have done that. I'll have to teach you a lesson. Hold it. You give up? On one condition. What condition? That you join us. There's a village of women, children and old people who are going to be destroyed unless something is done. We decided to help them and we need you. If there are children and old people in danger, you can count on me. Guess who that is. Don't tell me. I know. Greetings. You thought you'd really gotten rid of me, didn't you? That wasn't very nice of you to leave me there, now was it? It's enough. Now you're here, so just be quiet or we'll get rid of you, understand, boy? Fine, fine. Look! Look over there! They're coming back, they're coming back! It's Nicerote. They're coming back. To the temple. Everybody to the temple! What's wrong with you people? We've come all the way from Rome to help you and you act like frightened geese. You treat us like an enemy When, in fact, we have come to defend you. Wait. Fear is the only thing that still holds us together. Forgive us. Thank you for coming. Thanks to all of you. Thank you, Han. Anakora, Anakora. The man I told you about is here. Han. Yes, he is the predestined one. He has the strength and nobility of a hero. He is the one. Yes. And six others have come to defy the tyrant. Kill them! Kill them all! Hiya! Just a few ragged skins and some wine. Not worth the trouble to get such miserable loot. You're right, Dex. It's hardly worth the trouble. I'm beginning to miss Clusium. I miss the women. Pandora, she shall be mine. She's yours. Take her, my friend, and I shall celebrate your marriage. To Clusium! All right, now try and remember the moves in the correct sequence. Ready? Attack! No, you're dead. The key to good archery is how you hold the bow. The left arm must be kept straight and rigid. Straight and rigid, like this. But what kind of lesson are you giving? A less... No! -Glafiro! Calm down. She didn't mean it. Give me a club before a sword any day. Show me where the gold is hidden and I'll give you a surprise. What gold are you talking about? What gold? Have it your way. En garde! Good. All right. From the left side. No, for a right parry like this with the elbow bent. If a man comes at you with a sword, like this... all you have to do is parry and thrust. Try it. -All right. -Let's see if you can do it. Get ready. Parry. Thrust. You're supposed to thrust with the sword. Why? Home sweet home. Yes, and this time we'll stay a little longer. Long enough to make an impression on them that they will never forget. -Hiya! -Ho! It seems like they are all asleep. Go search the area. Search the area! Nobody. What are we going to do? Tell the others to take positions to protect the people. What about you? Don't ask questions, do it! I need the sword. Yes. Who are you, friend? I'm not a friend. Why should I call you an enemy when I don't even know you? But I know you, Nicerote. Dex, send three men. Bring me his head. You, you, and you. Go! All right, Nicerote, I am ready for you now. Kill them all. -Hey! -What? Don't get carried away. You're not my keeper. Han, I'd like to talk to you, would you mind? Of course not. Come on, let's go for a walk. Why, yes. We'll be leaving at dawn. So soon? Isn't that what you wanted? What do you mean? Nothing. Only that Nicerote has been defeated and Clusium liberated. You don't want the seven of us around here anymore. Oh, I was thinking... couldn't you stay, Han? -If you'd stay-- -What about the others? They're not like you. But like me, they risked their lives to help you. I know, but... they're different from you. They're different. They did it for the sake of adventure. They did it for treasure, or just to follow a hero. I am not a hero. Yes, you are. You are a hero. No... no! Cornelia. Cornelia, I love you. But you'll leave. You'll go back to Rome and you'll forget me. You saved us this time. But what about the future? We'll always be vulnerable. When people like Scipio and the others find out that staying here means being farmers and going hungry when the harvests are poor, it's almost certain that they'll seek richer pastures. And we'll be unprotected, and I'll have no choice. Just what are you trying to say? That I love my people. And for my people, I'd even sign a pact with the Devil. You mean if Nicerote came back here? Mm. Come, Livia, it's time for me to go. Hey, boy. Ah, here, I left some for you, friend. Livia? Livia, what is happening? Where are you? Livia? Livia, what kind of game is this you're playing? Come here at once! You! Who are those men celebrating over there? And who brought them here? I did. It's against nature for a mother to want to see her son dead. You are no longer my son. My son died the day I became blind. You are the cause of my darkness. If it isn't against nature for a mother to want to see her son dead, then it shouldn't be against nature for a son to want to see his mother dead. Why did you come back? What do you want here? Revenge. Scipio, wake up. I've got a funny feeling. Oh, really. Where? I'm serious. Attack! - They're Nicerote's men. - This way. Enough. Let's go! - After them! - Come on! Hurry! - Julia? - I'm here! -Stay back. Where is Nicerote? In Clusium. It's a trap. Stop. Stop! It's useless to fight, useless! That's right. As she said, it's quite useless. Why die in glory when the people you came to protect no longer want your protection? What do you mean? What do I mean? I mean the people of Clusium don't want you here anymore. They are now on my side. It's true. We don't want you here. Go. Leave us in peace. All you've done is make things worse. Do you understand? Drop your arms! I was thinking of killing the seven of you in a most amusing way by skinning you alive then sprinkling salt over your bodies. But these wonderful ideas are nothing compared with the punishment I have in mind. You will go on living, without honor, as the seven gladiators who failed their task. Incompetents rejected by the people of Clusium and replaced by me, Nicerote. They only agreed to it out of fear. Say it, you're all terrified, aren't you? Answer, damn you! And after all we have done for you! Dex! Grab this worm. Take the rest of them up the hill, return their weapons and get them out of my sight. Move, you worm! You heard me, move! Ha! The miserable seven! Farewell, heroes. "Heroes." Nothing like this ever happened to me, never. I'm going back to Clusium. What? After all they've done to you? After risking your life? I did that for them. This time, it's for me. He's right. We've got our dignity to defend. You too? I go just for the little ones. None of this is their fault. I'd like to see their faces when we return. I know you. You're not in it for the generosity. That's a fact. We just don't like being made fools of, right, Glafiro? You're all crazy. Nicerote was right! Only it's the miserable six now! Farewell, heroes! Farewell, Clusium. Good riddance! Nicerote! Do you hear me, Nicerote? We've come back! Do you hear me, Nicerote? We've come back for you! Nicerote! I want you! I've come to kill you! Where are you, Nicerote? Do you hear me? Nicerote! Nicerote! Answer me! Ah! Hey, Scipio! I can't let you die alone! Han. Take it! -For Nicerote. -Mm-hm. Goliath, you're fantastic. Look out! -You know something? -What? I figured you'd come back. Please don't refuse it this time. We're not going to need it anymore. But you will. Good luck. Thank you. -Farewell. -Farewell. Did you see how much she cried? Not real tears. Of course. As if they could weaken the manly spirit of adventure of our comrade here. Besides, think of what life in a village like this must be like, among frightened, defenseless farmers, sweating in a field from morning till night. Compared to the life we lead, living off the land, going where we want, when we want, answering to no one. Free. Don't even think about it. You've done the right thing coming with us. Good choice. Listen, actually, I... Well? I want to go back with them. What are you waiting for? You mean you'd let me go just like that? You really wouldn't get mad? We'll get mad if you don't. Then, ah... then good luck, friends. Farewell. -Farewell. -So long, boy. Ha! Ha! I told you I'd come back.
