"The names of persons and organizations in this movie" "have been partially changed." "Produced by Taka Ichise" "Directed by Koji Shiraishi" This video documentary is deemed too disturbing for public viewing. These are books written by Masafumi Kobayashi, a journalist who had been chronicling supernatural phenomenon since 1995. He gathered accounts of strange occurrences... in his pursuit of horrifying and unsolvable mysteries. Once he'd begun using video in his research he was able to compile his research on to videotapes. That bomb shelter? Yes. It's in there. I saw it over there. It running in the woods very quickly This is where you saw the ghost... Was it suicide? Yes. I saw him in the fender mirror. This is where... a family of five was massacred. In April 2004... Kobayashi finished his latest... video documentary, "The Curse". This has to have some connection. But soon after that... At night on April 12, Kobayashi's house burned down. Later his wife, Keiko was found dead in the remains. But Kobayashi wasn't found. He was declared missing. Masafumi Kobayashi had mysteriously vanished. His video, "The Curse"... reveals a truth too astounding for us to imagine. "I want the truth." "No matter how terrifying I want the truth." "Masafumi Kobayashi." "November 12, 2002, Koganei, Tokyo" "Masafumi Kobayashi, reporter of the supernatural." The spooky voices you mentioned... What kind of voices were they? It sounded like babies' voices. Babies' voices... "Ryoko Okui, housewife" When did it start? A couple of months ago. The sound comes from over there. Who lives next door? A woman in her 40s and her boy, aged between 6 and 9. There are two of them. They moved in about half a year ago. That was the only time that I saw the boy. I haven't seen him since. I see the mother every now and then when she goes out. But she doesn't greet me. I'm a bit scared. I don't want my girl involved, either. Let's go to the neighbor's. Let's go in. What a mess! Hello? Anybody home? I happened to be in the neighborhood doing some research and... What kind of way is that to talk to me? How can you talk to me like that? May I have a few minutes of your time... How can you? My name's Kobayashi and... Impossible. Give me a break. "The strange sound was recorded on video tape." Let's begin. Can you tell us what the sonic analysis revealed? Okay. We have the spectrographic analysis of the sound. It has a band of noise all the way through it. But here, there's a unique signal. I'll play it back for comparison. "The unprocessed audio signal." This one's noise-reduced. "The processed audio signal." As you can hear it's like some kind of animal sound. I have enhanced the signal. Listen carefully. A cat meows sequentially but this sound isn't like that. What's interesting about this sound is... that it doesn't repeat like a cat's meow, it ends with an inhale. That's the characteristic of a human baby voice. On closer examination it sounds like the voices of more than 5 babies. Several days after your visit... they moved out of that house. What? They moved out? How about the strange voices? Do you still hear the baby voices? Not since they moved out. So her name is Junko Ishii. Come here, Miyajima! Excuse us now. They died 5 days later. Mrs. Okui lost control of her car when she was driving. The car went over the divider into the incoming traffic... "Footage from a TV variety program, aired on August 3, 2003" Good evening, everybody! Good evening. Very good, everybody. Let me introduce you to Mr. Koichi Hirotsu, the psychic. Thank you very much. Can you tell us how the experiment proceeds? The first experiment deals with clairvoyance. "Experiment 1, Clairvoyance" In each of these containers there's a piece of paper. It has a drawing on it. I want you to imagine what's drawn. "First question" 10 children with ESP abilities from all over Japan. We're about to witness their powers! They all look kind of nervous. Everybody, concentrate right here. Try to envision the paper in the container. You'll get a vision in your head. None of us know... what's drawn on the paper. One of them is starting to draw what she sees. "One of them is starting to draw what she sees" Can she really see it? Let's open the container and take a look at the paper. What's on the paper? The answer is a double circle. But not just a double circle. Each circle has two points where the line is broken. It's a complicated shape. Did anybody get it right? "Results" You there... She got it right! Kana Yano can you show us what you drew? Take a good look, everybody. It's drawn with extreme accuracy. Even the scale is accurate. This is incredible! Kana Yano... She gave correct answers to all the questions up to 4. "Fifth question" Will Kana give an correct answer to the fifth question, too? Kana's already drawing something. "Results" Show us what you've got, everybody. The answer to the question looks like this. It's totally different. "It means Star in Russian" I guess this one was difficult. Maybe she's tired. Next we'll make water materialize in sealed bottles. It's called materialization. It is done by telekinetically envisioning water in the bottle. Let's do it. "Begin experiment" This requires intense concentration. And now... you're about to witness a miracle performed by Kana! Look, Kana's getting some water! Can you see it? At the bottom of the bottle... water's gathering out of nowhere! Of course, there's no false bottom on the bottle, nor the table. It's the same girl again. What were you thinking when you did this? I thought about water. When the water materialized... did you feel something different? Were you hot or numb? I had a headache. My, God! What is this thing? Some kind of hair? Yes. I guess she materialized it together with the water. What was it that mysteriously appeared in the bottle? Tests done on the water that Kana produced, have come in. "Professor Takaaki Yuhara, DSc" The major component is water. We found animal plankton which suggests that it's fresh water from either a river or a lake. The hair in the water is indeed that of an animal. It could be human hair, but because there's no medulla development... it could be from a newborn baby. "August 27, Fuchu, Tokyo" "Kobayashi interviewed Kana's parents." Hello. Thanks for coming. She's been sleeping all day? Since after lunch. "Kana Yano, the psychic who appeared on TV." She's had a slight fever since those TV experiments. She's spent lots of time in bed, resting. We took her to the doctor but he couldn't find anything wrong. We're very concerned about her. I thought the program was pushing the children too much... Too many experiments. I wonder if she's exhausted her powers on that one occasion... "Unused footage of a TV variety show taped on October 23" Hello, we're the Ungirls. We're so popular that ants crawl up our legs in the park. When I'm a pall-bearer I'm so tall that I have to hold the coffin myself. We're the Ungirls. We're on our way to a shrine, a popular ghost-sighting spot. It was deemed boring if it was just the two of us. So we have the actress Marika Matsumoto here too. Good evening. I'm Marika Matsumoto. I heard that you have a sixth sense. That's right. Have you ever had any supernatural experiences? Yes. Ever since I was a child... For so long? Yes. I've seen apparitions. Are you okay, Marika? I don't know... The back of my neck's tingling. You feel tingly? I'm scared... Maybe we shouldn't go in there? But that's what we are here for, so we're going in. Here we are! You want to go in? It's spooky... Guys! I feel something over in that direction. I feel something really strange... This way. We'd better stay here. Let's all go in together. It feels very strange... But there's nothing here. Maybe it's here... Yes, it is. Can you bring the camera over here? Only these trees are dead. Everywhere else the trees are okay. They're okay there, too. Only here, they're dead. Look at this tree. So lumpy. Yuck... It's dripping with something sticky. What's this? Is it oozing from the tree? No! Don't touch it! I mean it. Stay back... Is it bad? Shit! What's wrong? I heard something... Did you hear that? Did I? I heard nothing... Something... lt was a low voice, like a man's. A man's voice? Was that you? I've had enough of this. There's nothing over there. Stop the camera! Stop it! "November 26, a live talk show, A Night of True Horror Stories." Wasn't that something special? It was incredible. I was blown away. How do you feel now, Marika? I feel embarrassed. So this footage was edited out? That's right. The director arranged for me to have a copy. In the footage, you said you could hear a man's voice. It was a very low voice. It sounded like it was calling me. Did you see me turn when I heard the voice? I remember nothing from that point on. Nothing at all? No. Tonight, we have a special guest who'll examine Marika's condition. A person with psychic ability. Let's welcome our guest! Let's hear it for him! Calm down, he's our guest. Our guest has arrived in an outfit that's very different. Can you see us up on the stage? Come this way. We want you to use your power and give us your impression of Marika. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mitsuo Hori. A man with unique psychic powers. He's engaged in activities to protect humans against ectoplasmic worms. Look at the flier you were given at the door. It's difficult to follow his thoughts... Hey, let her go. You are in big trouble! Pigeons! My, God! The pigeons! The pigeons! Show him the door. Watch out for the pigeons! "Midoriyama TV Studio" "Kobayashi met the director of the variety show." Are you Mr. Kobayashi? - I'm Kobayashi. - I'm Shimbashi. When I gave the footage to Marika, I edited something out. I didn't want to spook her. This is right before she screams and collapses. There's something I want you to see. "Sugishobou Publishing" Hello. This is Miyajima, our cameraman. Nice to meet you. I'm Marika Matsumoto. It's my pleasure. It's on the right side of you on the video. You can see it just briefly. I'll pause the image for you. Right after this. It's here. Oh, God... I don't know if it's related... What is it, Ms. Matsumoto? Something's been bothering me lately Take a look at this. The drawing? I don't know what it is. But I find myself drawing these images unconsciously. When did you start drawing these patterns? I guess... After the video shoot at the shrine. The shrine... Wait! There are so many... I can feel it! Wait, wait... Can you see something? No, I can't see anything but... There are so many of them! I don't know what they are... I've had enough of this. Do you see something? "December 4" The slight fever she had stopped some time ago... But instead, she's beginning to act strangely recently... It's strange. She's often talking to somebody when there's nobody in the room. Who is it that you talk to... that your mother isn't able to see? I guess it's too late for all of us. What do you mean? We'd better take it, too. No! What's wrong? Kana... Kana, you'd better lie down. Excuse me... "Footage from a variety show aired on December 9" Now, Maria Takagi went to interview a psychic! Let's watch the interview. This psychic man was really something. - You saw him? - I did. - It's on video? - Yes! Okay, let's not watch it. No? It's like... duh! What kind of reaction is that? Here's the interview with The Super Psychic! This is Maria Takagi. Today, I'm here to meet with the super psychic who lives around here. I can't wait to find his place. Is it true that your next door neighbor is a super psychic? Super psychic? I think he's a freaking psycho. I saw him several times putting out the garbage... He's a freaking psycho. He can't be cured. So he's a freaking psycho. Is this it? "Strange messages on the garbage" Hello! Is the super psychic home? Are you the super psychic? Mitsuo Hori... I can do that. I'm psychic. Could I interview you? Is it alright? I'm coming inside. Can you see this? We've got to show this! The room's covered entirely with aluminum foil! Hundreds of fliers are stored in these boxes. What's written on these fliers? I mean... What are they for? For years, I've been receiving dangerous information... Dangerous messages... Space... What? - Space! - Space! With space... I can connect... I can see the future... Many bad, bad guys... Ectoplasmic worms... It says so here. "Ectoplasmic worms." The worms are all over, crawling, squirming... The super psychic's expressing himself with body language. Is that his expression for the ectoplasmic worms? "December 22" Was anything out of the ordinary around the time that Kana vanished? For about a week before she disappeared... there was a man who kept visiting her. I had no idea what he was talking about. He was wearing a hat covered with aluminum foil. And also... he had a long coat covered with aluminum foil. And for some reason, Kana told me... that the man was of no threat to her... On the day that Kana disappeared... We found this strange flier. It was placed face down. It says, "Help." I think this is Kana's handwriting. See what Kana drew on this? Has she always drawn this kind of pattern? "Kana's parents said they'd never seen anything like this before." "Help." "The worms are increasing. If we don't deal with them..." Hello, is Mr. Hori home? Excuse me. I'm a journalist doing some research. Can you help me with my research into the missing girl, Kana? Who are you? My name is Kobayashi. I believe we met on the talkshow the other night. What? Come in! Oh, excuse me. What's with the aluminum on the walls? Why are you covered with it? It protects me from the tingling. Because the ectoplasmic worms are near... What are these ectoplasmic worms? These horrible worms... they are everywhere. They eat people and they multiply. Eat people? Kana... She was eaten, too. Kana? Mr. Hori. You know something about her, don't you? Where is Kana now? I lost track of where she is... Mr. Hori! Let go of my bag! Stop it at once! Kana! This flier... I picked it up at her house. What do you know about her disappearance? Quiet! Blue... A blue building... A blue building... Blue? Galvanized iron sheets... What is it? Cars... A parking lot? Is he drawing a map? The worms are coming out... The worms? The worms are coming out. A young man... A young man. The worms took Kana away. They took her away! To that direction? Wait a second, Mr. Hori. I have a map for you. This is where we are. That way! I can't read the map... Did he say that way? What's Kagutaba? Kagu... What did you say? Calm down, Mr. Hori! Are you okay? Calm down! Go away! Excuse us! Something weird happened to the video image... What do you mean, "weird"? "Kobayashi looked for Kana according to the map of Mitsuo Hori." Mr. Kobayashi, how about that apartment over there? There is a parking lot. But they're in different positions. That's a blue building. But it has only two stories. This isn't it. This is difficult. Hello, this is Marika Matsumoto. I have something I want to show you. What is it? "December 26, Meguro, Tokyo" I wanted to show you these loops. When I woke up yesterday morning, I found the yarn. And the wool was tied into these complicated knots. With many loops. I don't recall putting the yarn here before I went to bed. I don't remember tying the wool in knots, either. Something must have happened while I was asleep. I'm scared to fall asleep now... I'll leave the camera plugged in. Turn it on when you go to bed. Okay. "Later that night" And you never woke up until morning? No. And you remember nothing after you fell asleep initially? No, I don't. These loops look just like the ones on the wool. They do... Very similar... The way they are tied... Maybe this is the same banging noise recorded on the video. It may be. A girl who works for the same agency lives upstairs. Is that right? How long has it been like this? Lately... Uh-huh. Sorry to bother you. What's up? Is this for TV? Have you been banging on the floor? What? No, I haven't. Did you hear a banging sound? I've been here all day, but I didn't hear anything. - Didn't you? - No. I heard banging... late last night, too. Really? I didn't hear that either. Are you sure? Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary recently? Have you felt inexplicably sick? Anything like that? No, nothing strange has been happening in my life. Sorry. Did we scare you? No, it's okay. "January 6, 2004, Nakano, Tokyo" I didn't know what this was before... But I think this is a telephone pole 3 stories. Even the number of windows matches. It's a bluish-colored building, too. And the room indicated is... 2nd from the right on the 3rd floor. The one with garbage bags on the veranda. Let's go to the room. A person named Osawa lives here. Hello, is Mr. Osawa in? I can hear something inside. Excuse me. Do you know anything about Mr. Osawa who lives next door? He's a man of about 25. I barely see him. He's often talking to himself. He was also making the banging sound a while ago. Did you hear that noise? Have you ever seen the man with a girl of... about 10 years of age? No, I've never seen him with a girl. "January 7" The pigeons are only on Osawa's veranda. It's strange. Keep the camera on the room. Definitely. There he is. "A few days later, Osawa vanished." There's a strange sound on the tape of Marika in her room. I'll play it back. Around here. Did you hear that? "We had the tape analyzed." The original sound's here. On the right it's processed. You can compare them. The noise is reduced on this recording. What's Kagutaba? What do you think? It actually sounds like... the voice I heard at the shrine that night. You mean the shrine you visited for the TV show? Yes. It sounds just like that voice. The voice on the tape seems to be saying, Kagutaba. Kagutaba? Does the word Kagutaba mean anything to you? No, I don't think so. I've never heard of it. "Kobayashi started to look into the word Kagutaba." It's this word, Kagutaba. Yes, Kagutaba. It's far fetched, but you could speculate that it derives from Kamitama, meaning god's spirit. I see. God's spirit... Have you ever heard a foreign word that sounds like Kagutaba? I can't think of any. Is this Doctor Shioya? I'm trying to find out about a strange word. The word is Kagutaba. Kagutaba? Yes, that's right. Kagutaba... I think I saw it in some book or something. It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. Let's get down to business. The book you mentioned on the phone. Can I take a look at it? This is an ethnological document compiled by the Tokita county office I found the word Kagutaba mentioned in this book. There's a town called Shikamimachi in Tokita county. Right next to the town there used to be a village called Shimokage village. It's now at the bottom of a dam. Before the village's demise the villagers had a strange custom. It was called the demon ritual. Demon ritual? It was performed to pacify the demon. And according to the book... The demon was called Kagutaba. Does that mean that Kagutaba is the name of a demon? Well, it's difficult to say. I think that it was just... convenient for them to call the unknown entity a demon. This is a document that is over 200 years old. It says Kagutaba right here. The kanji characters for "disaster, tool and spirit." The 3 characters make up the word Kagutaba. A tool that's capable of causing disasters. That's what it means. A long time ago, in Shimokage village... there was a group of sorcerers who migrated from the west. They developed a type of sorcery called "Shimokage's Way." One of their spells was called the "Kagutaba method." The sorcerer performed the spell to summon Kagutaba... which was sent to an adversary to put him under a deadly spell. The document says that that was the role of Kagutaba. But in one incident, when a sorcerer summoned Kagutaba... it disobeyed the instructions of the sorcerer. It started to do evil things on its own. So the sorcerer... performed another spell and finally succeeded in confining Kagutaba deep underground. "Shimokage Village submerged with the construction of Shikami Dam in 1978" "The demon ritual was discontinued." This is Shikami town hall. I'm interested in the old rituals performed at Shimokage village before it went underwater. Okay... Hold on please. So you want to know about the Shimokage rituals? Yes, I do. We don't have it very well documented so... I'll introduce you to someone. Mr. Tanimura researches local history. Hello, my name's Kobayashi. Oh, hello there. Please come in. The ritual was never performed publicly. So there's no documentation. But the last ritual performed in 1978 was filmed by a film production contracted by Mr. Ishii, the priest. These are the 16mm films. I pleaded with the Ishii family to give them to me. This is the video. I transferred the film to video. Shimokage village was a community of sorcerers. The villagers still believe in sorcery. Now it's becoming a fading memory but they still place a sickle at the door to keep away evil spirits. Those who left the village have a sickle above their front doors. Interesting. "We don't need a dam!" Shimokage sorcerers used dogs in their rituals. That's why the villagers still have dogs. This is the Demon Shrine where the ritual was performed. Mr. Ishii was a priest at this shrine. You'll see him in a minute. Look. That's Kagutaba. This ritual is to pacify the demon. Now Kagutaba is rampaging. That's Ishii, the priest. He is going to pacify Kagutaba. Now the priest will bow... One bow, four claps... and one bow. This is a distinctive way to bow, only done at this shrine. Usually it's two bows, two claps and one bow. But this is one bow, four claps, one bow. There is no other place in Japan where people bow in this manner. But after the priest bowed... The woman who was playing the part of Kagutaba became delirious. They had to stop the ritual. The religious villagers said that she was possessed. Some said that owing to the dam plan... the ritual wouldn't be performed again, which angered Kagutaba. They thought it was some kind of curse. In the legend, Kagutaba was confined underneath Shimokage village. And it's the demon in the ritual. What was it really? Nobody knows for sure. I would like to meet Mr. Ishii, the priest. Is that possible? 7 years ago, immediately after giving me the film... Mr. Ishii died from an illness. So did his wife but their only daughter's still alive. She was the possessed woman in the film... She recently moved back here from Tokyo. I heard that she lives with her son in the Ishii house. She's in the Mikaishi community, where the Shimokage villagers moved to. Mikaishi? I also heard that she's a bit eccentric. I don't know if she'll talk to you. "Mikaishi Village" I think we're almost there. What's this? This has to have some connection. Hello? Hello? Anybody home? How can you talk to me like that!? I'm asking you! How can you talk to me like that? Did you see her? I did. A woman in her 40s and her boy, aged between 6 and 9. How can you just talk to me like that? So her name is Junko Ishii. Kobayashi asked around. Look, the sickle. Hello, anybody home? Is anybody home? Nobody. May I help you? Excuse me but do you know the Ishii house down the street? There seems to be something strange... Yeah, ever since the daughter came back. You'd best stay away from her. For you own sake. Excuse me. What? Sorry to bother you. TV? You know Mrs. Ishii down the street. Ishii? I'm a journalist doing research. You may be able to help me. Could you help me? Come in. Oh, thank you so much. I was a good friend of Junko's before she moved out. She left the village to go to nursing school in Tokyo. Do you remember the name of the school? Musashino Nurse School or something. I don't remember clearly. How can I put this... Has Junko always been... mentally disturbed like she is now? Not at all. She was just a friendly, regular girl. Was she? She changed after the demon ritual. The demon ritual? She started to act strangely. I think the ritual caused her to become possessed. She told me that she'd heard god's voice. She said she had to obey his words. She became kind of strange after that. I heard that people thought it was the Kagutaba's curse. Do you think she was... Excuse me? Hello? "January 21, Musashino, Tokyo" May I ask a few questions about Junko Ishii, one of your graduates? After she graduated in 1982 she got a job at an obstetric clinic in Hachioji. I can disclose the name of the clinic but it closed in 2000. May I ask you some questions regarding somebody you used to work with? Sure. Junko Ishii. What kind of a person was she? She was a very hardworking woman. Quiet in a spooky sort of way. She was the kind of woman who only talks about work. The clinic we used to work for... performed abortions even into the 22nd week of pregnancies. It's clearly illegal. And she was the one in charge of disposing of the aborted embryos. There was a rumor that she took the embryos home. "Did she really take the embryos?" "If she did, for what purpose?" "February 6" Midori? Is she your colleague... the one who lives directly upstairs? Yes. Midori has... She's dead. The police came and told me that... Midori... committed suicide. She did it in the park. She killed herself with... a bunch of strangers. They hanged themselves... Do you think it was my fault? I got so scared that I left the apartment. I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Kobayashi asked his wife to take care of Marika. I'm home. Hi. Keiko, my wife. Nice to meet you. It's nice of you to let me stay. "News footage aired the same night" 6 am today in Hironuma Park in Nerima, Tokyo... 7 men and women were found dead. They were hanging from the iron bar of the swing. It's suspected that the strangers got together to commit suicide. "7 bodies hanging from the swing." Here are the names of those who hanged themselves. "February 10" Look. This is the girl who lived upstairs from Marika. And look at him. When he first moved in he was just a pleasant, normal guy. But about half a year ago... It was around last summer... He started to complain a lot to the woman who was living next door. They argued a lot. Is that right? His neighbor was a tough middle-aged woman. But eventually she moved out. I guess she felt scared. The neighbor moved out? Do you remember what kind of arguments they used to have? He complained about the baby being too noisy. A baby? She didn't have a baby, though. It was just her and her boy who was 5 or 6. Just a moment, please... Is the woman who used to live there... Is this the woman? Yes, that's her. No mistake. It's her. "News footage, February 12" Next news. Earlier today at an apartment in Fuchu a businessman stabbed his wife to death and got arrested. Our reporter is at the murder site. Today at 7:10 am a man called the police and said that he'd stabbed his wife. The police rushed to the apartment and found Kimiko Yano stabbed to death. Also at the site was the suspect, Teruyuki Yano, her husband. He confessed and was arrested on the spot. So far he has not told the police why he killed his wife. Their daughter has been missing for a few months. Do the police know anything about her disappearance? They have no information on her. Kana, the daughter disappeared on December 19 last year. No clues have been found. Today, Marika's cooking for me. It's something yummy. It's Spaghetti al Bongole with tomato sauce. Here, my special pasta and potato salad. They look great. And this is... my special tea. Isn't it out of a can? No. It's my special oolong tea. Would you like some Tabasco? Yes? Here it comes. A gourmet lunch. Marika? Marika! Marika, what's wrong? Did I groan? Yes. You seemed to be suffering, you groaned and... And some things crashed into the window at the same time. What is it? Are you okay? I'm... I'm the next one to die. I'm going to Nagano again. I'll talk to Junko Ishii... and get her to talk to us. That will help us solve this mystery. Hori, the psychic said to watch out for pigeons. Did he mean that pigeons were a sign of imminent death? Let's visit him tomorrow and ask him about it. "We visited Mr. Hori" "to show him the Junko Ishii tape." "February 13" Mr. Hori. Are you ready, Mr. Hori? This is what we want you to watch. It's on this tape. I'm sorry. I've turned it off. Mr. Hori. When you watched the video, did you feel something or did you see anything? Mr. Hori. Mr. Kobayashi. Take me to the dam... where the village was, the one with the demon rituals. Why do you want to go there? I want to try to perform the ritual myself... and see what it does to me. Absolutely not! The ritual might have caused Junko Ishii's possession. It's too dangerous. If the ritual is necessary, I'll go and do it by myself. I don't want to die... I have to do it myself. Please. Okay then. Let's go to the dam. I'll visit Mr. Hori again and ask him to come along with us. Mr. Hori! We need your help! What can we do to contain the Kagutaba curse? Mr. Hori. We can't do this without your help. Kana... The worms have eaten her... Maybe these worms are actually Kagutaba. It's too quiet around here... Where are the dogs now? "We drove to the dam where Shimokage village used to be." "Shikami Dam" Are you okay? This is where we are on the map. So the shrine must have been... right between that point and the shore. Off we go. Let me know when you get back. Thank you so much. We'll be back soon. Are you okay, Marika? You don't look good. We should go back. - I'm okay. - Are you sure? We're almost there. It's about here. Let's get ready. Good. Now, you bow in that special way. One bow, four claps, one bow... How do you feel? Talk to me. I'm better. Are you? I feel lighter. Good! It worked for you. It was good we came to do this! It's gone... What's wrong, Mr. Hori? It's not good... What's not good? It's not good at all... I feel so much clearer now. Thank you so much. Hurry back! Oh, no, no, no! Hurry! Get out of there! They'll eat you up! Now! Hurry! We have to leave the mountain! Drive away! Let's get out of here, then. Back to the car. Mr. Hori. Kana! Wait a minute, Mr. Hori! Take care of Marika. No problem. Mr. Kobayashi, wait! Don't worry, I'll be right back. He's okay. Let's go. Are you sure? To the car. Wait a minute! Are they going to be okay? I'll go look for them later. How do you feel now? Me? I'm feeling just fine. Let's go then. Mr. Hori! Kana! Mr. Hori, you have to stop! Kana! Wait a minute! Marika? Wait for me, Mr. Hori! What is it? What's wrong? Dogs? They've just been killed... Are they the village dogs? What's happening now? What's this? It's a magic field... What's going on here? More dead dogs... Don't go in there! Stay away! Marika! Are you okay, Marika? Marika, what's wrong? Should I pull over? Are you okay? What's wrong? Are you okay? Marika! Marika! What's going on, Mr. Hori? What did you find there? Marika! Marika! Marika, can you hear me? Can you hear me? Marika! It's a shrine! Kana... Kana... Mr. Hori! Mr. Hori, is Kana in there? Marika. Marika! Marika! Marika! Kana. Is she in there? This is ancient. My God! This pattern is the same as what Kana drew... What's wrong, Mr. Hori? Mr. Hori, are you okay? Mr. Hori! Get a grip of yourself! Marika! Come back! Can you hear me? Yes... Are you okay? Yes... What is this? "We took Marika and Mr. Hori to a local hospital." "And we went back to Junko Ishii's house in search of truth." Excuse me! Let's go in. Let's go and see. Film here. Let's go upstairs. It's Junko Ishii. It's her. She's hung herself. Look at that! Kagutaba masks. She's hung pigeons up here... There is a boy behind there! A boy? Behind there! Kana! It's Kana! It's her! Kana! She's cold... Are you okay? Are you hurt? Miyajima. We have to call the police now. "Missing girl found dead in Nagano." "The boy presumed to be Ishii's son" "isn't actually her child." Kobayashi decided to adopt the boy. "March 6" Is it good? Yummy? It's a good omelet, isn't it? Do you remember anything about living with that woman? Marika, you look very good now. Yes. I've been recovering nicely. All those supernatural things... have stopped happening. Everything's normal now. Have you gone back to work? Yes. I'm going back to work soon. You have to eat it. Okay, let's eat everybody. Let's eat. Yummy. Are you sure? Don't hit me! Ouch... "March 13" "Hori has been committed to an institution." "No visitors are allowed." "March 17" I looked around for other things connected to Kagutaba after you left. And I found this in my grandfather's collection. Here. It says, "Shimokage's Way, The Kagutaba method." Oh, that's right. I guess this scroll depicts the ritual performed to summon Kagutaba. These are the monkeys. And the dogs. They sacrificed the baby monkeys and offered them to the medium to eat. Just like the ancient spell of the Shimokage sorcery... which used baby monkeys as sacrifices. Junko Ishii used Kana Yano as a medium. She fed Kana the aborted babies... in an attempt to resurrect Kagutaba. It's only my speculation. Now that Junko Ishii's dead we'll never know the truth. I only hope that the Kagutaba curse has been contained. I guess it's too late for all of us. "Camera operator, Hisashi Miyajima" "Produced by Masafumi Kobayashi" 2 days after "NOROI, The Curse" was completed... The Kobayashi house burned down. Later his wife, Keiko was found dead in the remains. But Kobayashi wasn't found. He was declared missing. 3 days after the fire... Mitsuo Hori, who had escaped from the institution was found dead. "Picture of the Dead Man." "Mystery of the man who died in the duct!" May 19, 2004, a month later a package was delivered to Sugishobou Publishing. There was no return address. The sender's name was Masafumi Kobayashi. There was a video camera inside. And inside the camera... a video cassette was intact. What's going on, Mr. Hori? Are you okay? Mr. Hori? You... You've been eaten... by the worms! Are you? Excuse me? Why don't you put that rock down? I can hear Kana... Her voice comes in my head... - In my head... lt says... - What is it? Kagutaba's alive... It lives! What did you say? Kagutaba lives! But Junko Ishii's dead now. Kagutaba has gone now. You'd better go back to the institution. You should go back. Should I call the police? No... Stop! What are you doing? Stop! What you're doing! Stop it! There he is! What do you want? It's him! He killed Kana... Wait, just a minute. The boy's a victim, too. Kana! Hold on a second! Calm down. You have to listen to me. Just wait a minute. I'll help you with whatever you need. Let go off the boy, okay? No! Stop it! Are you okay? Kana! Keiko! Mr. Hori! Hori? Mr. Hori... Keiko? Keiko! Keiko! Keiko! Keiko! Keiko! "Masafumi Kobayashi is still missing today."
