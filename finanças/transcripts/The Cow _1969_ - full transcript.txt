Don't let him go. Throw him into the pool. Beat him...Beat him. Pour water over him. Beat him...Beat him. What are you doing? Go away!... Go! - Why do you bother him? - We didn't do anything to him. Didn't do anything to him? Why did you throw him into the water? If something happens to him, who will take care of him? It's all fault of Mash Saffar's son. With such long height, he has no shame, he still plays with the kids. My fault,huh? so now that it's my fault, CATCH HIM! Catch him...Don't let him go. - Hello to you, Reeve. - Hello. My wonder, ever since Mash Saffar's son is back from the city, he's been making troubles. He's learnt these things of there very well. Going to get milk? Mash Hassan's taken his cow to the pasture. And here, there is no more than one cow. Come. Eat. Come. Come...Come. That's it. Come...Yes... Drink. Here... People, my heart is manic this night. My heart's gone and is concealed this night. Plant wheat under my eyes, as my eye's water is sea this night. Hello, Mash Hassan. Hi...Hi... How are you? Come and sit. Drink some tea and take a break. Come Mashti. Don't come near. Keep this, kid. Come on. Give it to me, Mashti. Go away, don't gather round her. Go...Go... Here you are Mashti. Thank you, Reeve. Where are you, Mashti? He's been waiting to get a little milk from you. I took her to pasture. - Don't give it to her, makes her sick. - Let her alone kid. What is it, Mash Hassan? You're so touchy. Again, this damned Bolouris have shown. What?... Bolouris? Where? -God is Greater, you keep away from her. -I told you to stay away. Saw them on the top of the hill, on the way back. How many were they? As always, those three. You see, Reeve? I keep telling we should do something about this, but no one listens, at all! - What should we do now? - But what can we do? These Bolouris don't believe in anything. We have to leave it to God. If we don't do anything, they'll get more insolent. They've come and taken 3 sheep of mine. They ruined me, and no one did nothing to them. And now, it seems as if it's the turn of Mash Hassan's cow. What? My turn? No...No, God forbid. It was just an example. So to sum up, Reeve, hearing Bolouris' name makes my blood boil. I'll have my revenge, if it's the last thing I do. What would you do? I'll do something. heh, I'll do something. You're scared of them like hell. What on earth can you do to them? What an impudent boy he is. There is no God except for Allah. Mash Hassan, don't take your cow out. You took her out when the sun was still down. He's right, Mashti. Why do you take the pregnant cow out? Let her be in the cowshed, it's almost time for her. Thank God. Whereto, Mashti? Stay a while. Have to take her to the cowshed. I want to take a nap. Have to go to labor early morning. - Goodbye. - God be with you. Woman, give me that lantern. Let's make sure there's nothing hiding there to harm her. Not to bother this poor animal. Give it. - I'll sleep in the cowshed tonight. - Why? What has happened? The Bolouris are hanging around. Give me that lantern. - Does it belong to Bolour? - Yes. - Have you stolen that? - Yes. [Sound of Adhan] Oh, God. Why did this happen to me? God! Say something! Move aside, move aside! Breathe, breathe! Give her some water, might make her feel better. Shake her arms. Ya Ali! God help her. Drink, drink, in the name of God. Mash Islam! Hey, Mash Islam! - Is something wrong? - Mind your own business! I'm ruined What has happened? Tell us what has happened. Say something! Mash Hassan's cow died. Just went to take her some water, found her lying on the ground, a great deal of blood had come out of her mouth. But why? She wasn't ill, was she? No, she was fine this morning. Her head was in the rack all the time and she was eating. Surely It must be an evil eye. What evil eye? She says blood came out of her mouth. There you have it! God save us all from evil eyes. Islam! Islam! Ahoy Mash Islam! - Anything has happened? - Leave me alone, for God's sake. Now you tell me what I'm to do now! Nothing, what do you want to do with her? Now that she's dead, she'll never be back till doomsday! What should we do now, Mash Islam? There's no God but Allah. Poor Mash Hassan. Miserable Mash Hassan. Maybe a snake has bitten her. Now I say something, believe it or not, this is the Bolouris' deed. - How could the Bolouris have done it? - Well, it's clear, I swear they did it. Every person or animal that dies is Bolouris' deed? Yes, those heathens would steal if they could and would kill if they couldn't. Now, what's the advantage of these arguments? Let's be calm for a moment and see what we can do. You see what happened, Reeve? What am I to do now? Can you imagine how Mashti would react if he found out his cow is dead. She's right. She's right. I know how he'd feel when he gets back and finds out. What should we do now, reeve? I can't come up with anything, to be honest. Listen! When Mash Hassan comes back, nobody tells him his cow is dead, ok? Nobody tell him, but when he comes back and sees that his cow's gone, he'll figure it out himself. Won't he, Reeve? Yes, he's right, Mash Islam. When he comes back and sees that his cow isn't there, he'll find out that she's dead. Listen! Nobody tells Mash Hassan that his cow is dead. His wife will tell him that... ...that his cow is dead! - Will you let him finish? - I'm not stopping him! His wife will tell him that the cow has run away. Mash Hassan won't believe that! He knows the cow would never run away. He's right, Mash Islam. A pregnant cow never runs away. You want her to tell him that his cow is dead? And then he dies! His wife will tell him that his cow has run away, and that Esmayil has gone after her to find her. But Mash Islam, I'm here, brother. I haven't gone anywhere. Just suppose that you've gone after the cow. Just suppose. Thank god, that's solved. Tell me, Mash Islam What are we to do with the cow, now? We need to hide her somewhere, so that when Mash Hassan comes back, he won't be able to find her. I say, how about skimming the cow first then do this. No... First of all, it's now dead and her skin is 'haram', Secondly, he may show up and find everything out. How about taking her to "Dare Shoor" with Islam's cart? No, we must not do this, all the people would be aware of that and eventually Mash Hassan would hear about it. Then what do we do, Mash Islam? I really don't know. May God help us. It's a suffering, God help us. Ya Ali! Ya Ali! Turn her around. Ya Ali! Ya Ali! Incline her. Ya Ali! Ya Ali! May God help us, It's a suffering, God help us. Now... everyone should be careful not to tell Mash Hassan anything. Hopefully, no one will say anything. Even if no one says anything, at last he will! Hey, boy! I'm talking to you, listen carefully! Don't you tell Mash Hassan anything! Come here, Here! Come on, be quick! Don't tell Mash Hassan anything, don't tell his cow is dead! Got it? Yes! No, he won't say. He's not that stupid. Wait a second! You'll tell Mash Hassan his cow is dead? -Yes! -Yes! The solution to this is easy, We'll take him to the old mill and tie him there until it cools down. Yes, that's right. -Esmayil? -Yes? You must go hide somewhere, so that when Mash Hassan's back, he won't see you. Well... I go to our house. No, it's better that you come to our place. Yes, he's right. Go to Abbas' place! Dear God and savior... You yourself help us... Save us from this evil! Come in. Sit down. Come. Let's go. - Hassani! Hassani! - What? - My brother wants to go to Bolour. - So? - It'd be good if you go along. - Why? Well, you know the way better than he does. - Why does Jabbar want to go to Bolour? - He says he wants to get even. If you go with him, you can sleep over at our place when you come back. He won't let me spend the night in your home. He wouldn't know. He's a heavy sleeper. I'll call you one he's asleep. Why are you sitting here, Abbas? Islam told me to sit here and see when Mash Hassan comes. It's late now, he won't come this time of the night. Hey, Hey, Where are you two going? Is this all you got? But what about the sheep? You'd gone after the sheep. The more we looked, the less we found. Sleep! You and your stealing... He's come! Mash Hassan is coming, Mash Hassan is coming! Mash Hassan's come, Mash Hassan's come! Islam, Mash Hassan is coming. - He's coming? - Yes. Why are you all standing? Get to your work, everyone. Be quick. Go after your business! Be quick! Hello to you! Hey, Mash Hassan! Hey, Mash Hassan! Go home, your wife has got some news for you! - Hello. - Hello. Hello to you! Nice to see you here. I've come to see how Nasrin is doing. That's so kind of you. Did you give water to the cow? I asked if you'd given water to the cow! For God's sake, if I'm away from this house for a single day, our cow should die of thirst. He's coming... He's coming... Well, Mash Hassan, how is everything? Mash Islam... Come here, - Has something happened? - How come? Because these people go wild when they see me! No, there's nothing. Be sure. What's that, Mash Hassan? It's an amulet. I bought it from Misho, want to hang it around her neck. - Hang around whose neck? - The cow, of course, see, like this. Mash Hassan! Hey, Mash Hassan! Listen to me! Hey Mash Hassan! Listen to me! Didn't your wife tell you? Didn't say what? - Esmayil has gone after her. - After whom? After the cow, of course, didn't she tell you? The cow? What cow? Because she ran away. Who... who ran away? Your cow, your cow has run away. Don't worry, she must be somewhere near. Esmayil has gone after here, surely he'll find her. Mashti... Mashti! Masht Hassan! Come, listen to me! Masht Hassan... Mashti, listen to what I say! Esmayil is after her, be sure. Esmayil is after her, he'll surely find her. Don't worry, she is somewhere around. Nothing to worry about, Mashti. Heh, my cow hasn't run away, Mash Islam. My cow wouldn't run away. There is no deity except God. What a crazy situation I'm stuck in! Every time I hear a sound or someone comes near, I think it's Mash Hassan. He's at his home, he's not feeling well. - Have they told him his cow is dead? Yes, he thinks it's still in the cowshed. - That the cow is in the cowshed? - Yes. So, I'd better go then. They've told him you had gone after the cow. So what do you think I'm supposed to do now? Nothing, just stay here. - Villain has cut the rope and come out. - Leave him alone. Just let him be. Hello ma'am. - We've come to see Mash Hassan. - Quiet... What has happened? He's sitting up on the roof. What's he doing there? He says "My cow isn't lost, she wouldn't run away, she's right here." What shall we do now, Mash Islam? Yes, tell us what to do now, Islam. Let's go, try to talk to him somehow. - Hello Mash Hassan. - Hello Mashti. Mash Islam... why did you do that? What for? Reeve, you ask him. What did I ever do to him? Why did he lie to me? The truth is... I... No Mash Hassan, Islam never lied to you. He's right that you're cow has run away. My cow wouldn't run away, Reeve. If she were to run away, where could she go? Your cow ran away, Mashti. Mash Hassan, you yourself went to the cowshed this morning and looked, my brother. I didn't lie to you. My cow is right here, in the cowshed. If she's here in the cowshed, why don't you go to her? So go to the cowshed near your cow! Yes, so go to your cow! He's right, Mashti. I'm sitting here, watching. Watching what? Bolouris have plotted to come and steal my cow tonight. Ho do you know that? If the Bolouris are to come and steal your cow, why are sitting here? Go to the cowshed and stay with your cow. No, the moon will be out any time now. There it is! It's rising from Bolour. Mashti, you're just sitting here, what if the cow gets thirsty? Once the moon is out, I will take water for her. What if the moon doesn't come out? Every time my cow gets thirsty, the moon comes out. Hey, Mash Islam? Is there something wrong? - What's that sound, Mash Islam? - I don't know. - What's happened? - It was a Bolouri. I swear I saw them, they went this way. There were two of them. Let's go. Let's go, get sleep. We have to do something about it, anyway. - Hello Reeve. - Hello ma'am. - How's Mash Hassan doing? - He's not well, Reeve. Last night, after I fell asleep, he went out. He came back near dawn, soaking in blood. I seek the forgiveness of Allah... What's he doing now? Ever since he came back, he's been making cow sound. - What do you suggest we do, Mash Islam? - I don't know what to say. - Let's go in and see what we can do. - Let's go. - Hello Mash Hassan. - Hello... Hello... Mashti. Mash Hassan! Your cow's been found. Yes, Mashti, Esmayil is back and he's also found your cow. Yes, Esmayil is back. Here he is. Hello, uncle Mash Hassan. The cow's been finally found! You know where she was? Near Khatunabad, she was pasturing there in the valley! Fatter, healthy and strong! Thank God, she's all alright! Great God! Is there something wrong with him, Mash Islam? Let's go in and see what we can do. Why did you go back? I'm not coming in. - Why, Mashti? - I can't bear this. Are you scared? Don't be. It's Mash Hassan, our good old Mash Hassan! Hello, Mash Hassan. Are you alright? feeling good? Hey! Mash Hassan! I'm talking to you! Are you alright, Mash Hassan? I'm not Mash Hassan. Don't say this, Mashti, You're Mash Hassan. I'm not Mash Hassan. I'm Mash Hassan's cow. Don't say this, Mashti, you're Mash Hassan. Our good old Mash Hassan. Yes, I swear you're our old Mash Hassan. I'm not Mash Hassan. I'm Mash Hassan's cow. Don't say this, Mashti! God forbid, should the Bolouris find out, they'd come and steal you! - Yes, they'd come to steal you. - They'd come and cut your head off! Mash Hassan is standing up there, watching over me. Cut it out, for God's sake, Mash Hassan. What kind of a cow are you, anyway? - Where's your tail if you're a cow? - Where's your horn? - He's right! What do you say, eh? Ok, Mashti, stop it! Calm down, Mash Hassan! Ok, alright! Calm down. Great God! What should we do? You yourself get it in his head somehow, Mash Islam. Listen to what I say... Yesterday, at noon, your wife came to us crying in panic, said your cow had died. And we went, open the well's door and threw your cow in it. Isn't that right, Reeve. No, it's true. Alright, if you were Mash Hassan's cow, you would be in the well right now. And if you're not, then you're Mash Hassan himself. Yes, I swear to God, you're Mash Hassan. You tell, is he Mash Hassan or the cow? Of course, it's Mash Hassan... It's our Mash Hassan... And if you don't believe us, let's go open the well's door and look in it. Mash Hassan! Mash Hassan! The Bolouris are all over here! They want to steal me! They want to throw me in the well! They want to cut my head off! Mash Hassan! Come save your cow! Come save your cow! Save your cow... We're not Bolouris, brother, we're not Bolouris... I'm Islam, he's the Reeve... That's Saffar's son, and this is Abbas. We're all from this village, brother. We're not Bolouris... Let's go. Do you want me to get you anything? Water... Water... Come in! I want to go to our home. But I've made the lunch. Here... - Did you hear that? - Yes. I don't know how he will end up. - Why don't you eat? - I can't. - Do you want to drink tea? - No, I have to go. Where to? I want to go see what happens. Will you come back? No, I'll go to our home. By the way... I talked to my sister. About what? Everything. Just let all this calm down, then I'll send her to ask for your hand on my behalf. - Which way do we go? - Do you know his house? Got it today from a Khatunabadi. Let's go. - Who were they? - Bolouris. - What's happened? - Bolouris are in the village. I'll fix them. My sheep... My sheep! - Why are you shouting? - They took my sheep! It's right here. You watch over here, we'll go in. Ok. - What happened? - The cow's not there, he was there himself! Catch them! There were three of them. What do we do now, Mash Islam? Let's go. What happened? What's going on? - Nothing, Bolouris had come to steal Mash Hassan. - What? - How's Mashti? - He has not eaten anything. He hasn't touched the food. Mashti... Mashti... Dear God... Go... Go... He ran away. - Hello. - Hello. - Here you are. - Thank you. So... Mash Islalm, how is everything? I really don't know what to say. Last night, he ate everything that was in the cowshed. His food has become hay. How can his stomach take it? I really don't understand. I can only wonder! I am just amazed. It's not clear how he will end up. He's getting worse by the day. All over his body is full of wounds and scars. Mash Islam, after all you think better than any of us. You should think of a solution, brother. I think... How about taking him to the city? Taking him to the city for what? So we can take him to the hospital. They might be able to help him. You mean they can convince him in the hospital that he has not become a cow? I really don't know that, but they might be able to do something. What if we take him to the city but the hospital doesn't take him? - Why wouldn't they accept him? - What if they don't? Surely Mash Islam knows something that he says no. So who will take him, Islam? Me, you, and Mash Jabbar. My sister would be left by herself. I can't. Alright then, I myself will come with you. Is that ok? Alright, Reeve, you come with us. - Hello. - Hello. Have you told his wife? Yes, she's going to go to our house, so my sister won't be alone. Yes, that's better. You can't leave a young woman all alone. We've come to take Mashti. Mashti... Get up, get ready to go. Come on, get up. Get up, brother. Let's go, Mashti. Go on. Mashti! Let's go. Get going. Get going. Masht Hassan... Come! Get the rope! Tie him. Calm down! Easy! Knot it from the other side. Abbas, knot it tightly. Knot it tightly. Go away! He can't be taken with the cart. We must drag him like this to the road... Come on! Pull him forward! Come... Mash Islam! Mash Islam! Mash Islam... Look up there! Let's go. Come on, get going. Come, Mashti. Come, hold the rope, Reeve. Come on, be quick. Go! Movie it! Move it, animal! Go! Mash Islam! Catch him... Mash Islam! Stop, Mash Hassan! Mash Hassan... Hey... Mash Islam! Islam! Didn't you go to town with the Reeve and Mash Abbas? Yes. Then, why did you come back? I've come to take the cart. What did you do with Mash Hassan? Masht Hassan? Yes. I'm going to bring him back. So you're not taking him to town anymore? The End Subtitles: coloraday @ KG
