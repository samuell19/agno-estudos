What's your plan for summer holidays? I'm going to get rid of my math book. Chozhan, come with us today. Let's go on a jolly cycle ride. I'm not coming. He won't come. Look there. His father, 'Risk' Ramalingam is here. Let's get out of here. Did they ask you to come along for a cycle ride? They'd have made you ride down the hill if you'd been tempted to agree. You'd have crashed into a rock and come home crying with an injured knee. 'Risk' Ramalingam! Son of a clown! He has no respect for elders. You should come home straight from school, okay? This is my father, Ramalingam. He lives in constant fear that something bad is about to happen. He goes on and on about all the risks involved in anything and everything. People started calling him 'Risk' Ramalingam. I could go on talking about him. The whole world breaks coconuts at a temple one way... But my father... Why are you breaking it this way? If I break it in the open, a piece might get into the eye. No way. It's a risk. Let's go. I don't have a mother. Dad and I live alone at home. He works at his grocery shop all day, and comes home at night. That's his whole world. Chozhan, your holidays begin tomorrow. I bought your books for the next year. I've even made a studying timetable for you. Focus on your studies, score good marks... and you can get a secure bank job someday. Then you will get a bride from a high-class family. You can lead a fancier life than me. Every kid looks forward to their summer vacation. But I dread the holidays. I countdown the days left for school to reopen. I thought this year would be no different. But then Rajiv came into my life. And Pari Uncle. Be careful. Who else is unloading? Kandavel, is someone moving houses? You wouldn't want to know. These are police affairs. Police affairs? Say no more! How are your wife and kids? They are fine, brother. But you never come home because I am a policeman. So unfair! - Dad, whose house is this? - That doesn't concern you. This is Rajiv. He joined my class. His father, Parirajan IPS... is a retired CBI officer. Rajiv's summer vacation was a whole lot different to mine. - Rajiv... - Yes, Dad? If you wish to become a great police officer someday... you shouldn't waste a single moment of your vacation. ?? Catch it. Come on. I'm timing it. Go. Whenever I saw them, Pari Uncle was always teaching his son something new and interesting. Solved it, Dad. Seventy seconds. You are getting worse by the day. Your punishment is 10 minutes on the plank. Go! I really liked the things he taught him and the methods he used. Faster! Dad, I can't do it. It hurts. One second. There you go. - Dad, it hurts. - Let it hurt. One can conquer pain only through practice. And give it back to his enemy. I was amazed to know such fathers existed. Come on, bear it. Move! I wished to learn these things too. One day, when there was no one in their house... Hey! - You dare to steal from our house? - Rajiv, wait. What's your name? Chozhan. - Aren't you the boy from next door? - Yes, uncle. I know a Rubik's cube was missing. - I also know you stole it. - No, uncle... I'm sorry. You teach him something new every day... it was so tempting to watch. So I came here and took it. Good. - Take it. - No thanks, uncle. I learned how to solve it. Just don't tell my father. - You learned it? - Yes. Rajiv, come here. Catch it. Here. Both of you must solve it at the same time. The winner... gets a bar of chocolate. I'm timing it. Go! - I've solved it, Dad. - 53 seconds. Yes! 62 seconds was my previous best. I have improved by 9 seconds. I'm sorry, Rajiv. Chozhan finished before you. Forty five seconds. Good. The chocolate is yours. Thank you, uncle. Do you want to learn more? Yes, uncle. What is up with you? I don't like it. I don't want your training any more. Rajiv... what's your problem? I finished it within a minute. But you never appreciated me, and you gave him the chocolate. Tell him to leave. Am I not your son? You taught only me until now. Everything I do, I do for your good. When did you last solve this Rubik's cube in 62 seconds? Last summer. But today, you solved it in 53 seconds. Did you wonder what made you solve it quicker this time? Competition. All these days, you were training alone. But the moment you had a competitor... your strengths surfaced without even you realising it. - But Dad... - Listen to me. When I was in service... they tried to kill me 13 times. I got a bullet here. They almost succeeded. I'm still not free of death threats. That is why I am always on alert. Because the people gunning for us could be smarter and stronger than us. When you join the police force someday... if your enemy turned out to be like Chozhan... would you come crying to me? Or would you take him on and win? I will take him on and win, Dad. That's my boy. Rajiv! Here, take half of it. Rajiv... Give it back. Give. It. Back. You should earn your prize. If you get rewarded for losing, you'd lose the drive to win. Okay? Pay attention. Starting today, you both shall train together. They call this buddy-pairing in commando training. This yields better results than training solo. But what's important is... neither of you should compromise for the other person. When you compete, you're both enemies. At other times, best friends. Buddies. Yeah? Shake your hands. That's it. If you want to become a good police officer like me... you need to undergo a lot of training. The most important of it is photographic memory. That is, when you see a location or a scene... it should register in your brain like a photograph. Both of you, close your eyes. Let me test your photographic memory. What do you remember seeing on the path we just crossed? The corn stall. Fritters stall. And carrot stall. Chozhan, you forgot the sweater shop. Yes, the sweater shop too. Do you know what a policeman would say? Look behind me. A 40 year old is eating a banana at the fruit stall. The tea master is making 5 cups of tea. A lady is wrapping a pink shawl around a kid at the sweater shop. They are stacking yellow roses at the flower shop. A lady in a wheelchair is buying plums. There is a Bajaj scooter there. TN 43 1408. And a Maruti 800 next to it. TN 37 6823. Wow! That was superb, uncle. Chozhan, the lady picked up 5 plums. Did you notice one of the plums is rotten? Awesome! This is like magic, uncle. It looks like magic when you watch as a spectator. But if you work and train hard, anyone can become a magician. Pay rapt attention to my instructions and train hard without asking questions... and you can become that. Are you both ready? - Ready, uncle. - Ready, Dad. That's it. Are you feeling cold now? - No, uncle. - No, Dad. Nature...

Sir, how is my disguise? Your disguise is fine. - But your salute gave it away. - Sorry, sir. My son, Rajiv, and his friend will be coming out of the school any moment. Pretend you are not a police officer. - You are a pick-pocketeer. - Sir... Just act like a pick-pocketeer. You need to behave and act like a pick-pocketeer in a bus stand. Let's see if my boys can spot you before the crime takes place. How can little boys do this? Don't underestimate those boys. I trained them. Sir, Rajiv is a bright student. He could become a doctor or an IIT engineer. Do you have to put him under rigorous training at this age? Should smart people only become doctors or engineers? Criminals are getting smarter by the day. We need a few smart people in the department to stop them. Now, go. Take your position. ?? Thanks. Rajiv, what are you doing here? Looks like it might rain. Let's go. Okay, leave now. Let's meet tomorrow. What did you give that girl? You are hanging out with an older girl? That poor girl has no parents. I just wanted to help her. Keep it up, buddy. Hi! How come you are here, uncle? There is a reason for everything. Today, we shall begin testing your photographic memory. I'll give you 10 seconds. Pay close attention to your surroundings. And then I will ask you a question. Okay? I'm timing it. Go. That's it. Did you see anyone suspicious? The cobbler had a needle. There is a man smoking a beedi. An old man with a black umbrella. And... I got it, Dad. The black jacket. Everyone was looking at the road, waiting for the bus. But he was eyeing the pockets of those in front of him. He is a pick-pocketeer, Dad. Wonderful! Today, the chocolate is yours. - What happened, Chozhan? - Well, uncle... I, too, noticed all the things Rajiv mentioned. But his coat is hanging two inches lower on one side. His pocket is bulging. He's probably carrying something heavy, like a gun. I saw a police motorcycle near the gate. Look at his haircut and his moustache. Police. He is a plain-clothed policeman. Is he your friend, uncle? You invited him to be part of this game? Unbelievable, sir. Who is this boy? His name is Chozhan. He lives next door. But he is a natural. In two months, he learned everything I taught my son over the years. If he joins the police academy, he'll get a better rank than my son. He is so talented. What's the time? Pari Uncle was teaching us photographic memory, Dad. Photographer Maari? Is he going to open a studio in Ooty? You are hanging out with him all the time. - I don't trust that man. - Don't say that about Pari Uncle. He is a talented police officer. He said he'd train us too. I'll slap you! Don't talk like a fool. Police! Does he want you to suffer a bullet wound like him and sit idly in a rocking chair? Let me never see you around his house again... Listen carefully. I don't want you to even utter the word 'police'. Or I'll pull you out of school and make you work at the shop. Oh, so you are targetting my queen? What are you going to do about it? Chozhan, no matter how hard you try, you can't touch my queen. Check. You have no moves left. Check mate. Rajiv! Dad's calling me. I'll be back. Chozhan! Dad... Chozhan, look! Someone stabbed my dad and ran away. Dad... Wake up, Dad. Dad... Chozhan, please do something. Sir, what happened? What was the motive? He is an ex-CBI officer. About 4-5 men broke in and stabbed him. We are investigating. Please don't disturb me. Let us do our jobs. Sir, please let me go. Won't you behave? Sit down. Sit! Son... Who are you? What were you doing in that house? Sir, I live next door. Rajiv and I were playing chess. - I go there all the time. - All the time? Why? Pari Uncle was giving us police training. Police training? What are you saying? Please elaborate. Sir, you let those people escape. You haven't collected any evidence. Now you interrogate us like we are suspects? I'll thrash you. How dare you question me? I'll lock you up and break your bones. You can't do that. It's wrong to even bring minors to a police station. You've got a big mouth. - You punk... - Sir! My son doesn't know anything. Let him go, sir. He lectures me on rules! And he's getting police training? Is he implying that we are just loafing around here? Sir, he wasn't lying. Take us to the crime scene. We can help you with your investigation. Don't be so impudent, son. Sir, he used cards to teach them mathematics. I don't know any of that. So he went to their house often to learn from him. Sir, I've had a clean record all my life. We live next door to him. We don't know anything else. But Dad, we saw the car leave. You don't know anything. Shut up. Sir, I can't bear to see my son in a police station. Please let him go. Kandavel, please tell him. Sir, he never gets involved in any trouble. He just minds his business. This isn't some ordinary murder case. It's a highly sensitive police murder. It's a matter of prestige. We have orders to probe into this case and nab the culprit. They crashed the getaway car into an electric pole on the same street... ditched the car, and ran away. Only these two boys have seen them. I'll send for every criminal in the area. These boys need to identify them. - You... - Sir? Did you get their address and phone numbers? Yes, sir. You need to bring your son here whenever I send for him. - Understood? Leave now. - Okay, sir. Dad, what about Rajiv? - Dad, let Rajiv come with us. - Listen to me! Rajiv is my friend. - Let us take him with us. - Brother, stop! You stayed away from danger all your life... and now you've got yourself mixed up in such a serious case. The inspector is a weird guy. This case is going to end up in one big mess. The killers are still on the loose. - Oh no. - Brother, can I say something? The boy is a minor. They haven't filed an FIR against him yet. Don't overthink this. Just skip town. Kandavel, the boss wants to see you. Coming, sir. Get in the car. - We must leave right away. - Dad, wait... If we don't gather evidence and find them within 6 hours... it will be almost impossible. Take me to that house for 10 minutes. I can get the men who killed Pari Uncle. Have you gone crazy or what? Imagine if those people had stabbed you too. I told you several times not to go to that house. Chozhan, you're the reason I'm still alive. You are all I've got. Did you forget what happened to your mother? She went to stand up for a village dispute but came back as a corpse. The dispute got resolved. But our family ended up in the streets. We came to Ooty from Tuticorin just so we can get over it. And now you got yourself involved in something too? How do I make you understand? - I want to rip my head apart... - Dad, believe me... take me to that house for 10 minutes. Keep talking like this and... I'll jump off a cliff and die. Dad, please. Dad, I'll obey you. Dad, please don't go. I'll do as you say. Please, Dad. Promise me. You'll never talk about becoming a policeman. You'll never take risks in life. Promise me you won't do any of this. Promise me you will live your life the way I want you to. If you want your father alive, promise me. Promise me, son. I promise, Dad. [sloganeering] Get us back our passports! [sloganeering] Get us back our passports! [sloganeering] Tamil immigrants are not inferior! [sloganeering] Tamil immigrants are not inferior! [sloganeering] Get us back our passports! [sloganeering continues] Wait a second. Stop it. Why have you gathered here? Brother, there are about 150 of us. We have been out of work for 3 months now. Plus, our wages are due. None of us can go home even if we wished to. They've taken our passports too. We can't afford our daily bread, and we live on the streets like orphans. We don't even care about the unpaid wages. At least get us our passports back. I'll bid them goodbye, and return home. Wait, calm down. Stop it! You can't just march down the road with flags. This isn't like our country. They'll put you behind bars. You don't even have your passports, and you are creating a ruckus here? The man who sent for me is a Tamilian named Eshwaramoorthy. We will talk it out and arrive at a decision. I looked into your issue. The company is called Yellow Stone Constructions. The owner is a Chinese guy. He says their work permits were cancelled a while back... And they are free to work wherever they want. Sir, he is lying. He is lying to prevent them from taking up other jobs. Yes, I know that. But it will take months to prove that in court. You need to talk to the owner. You people sign every paper they show you. And you hand over your passports to them. Finally, you come to us when there is a problem. I'm sorry, Ganesan. I can't do anything about this without the owner's help. Sir, they toiled for him for years. But now his security guards chase them away like dogs. We are counting on you. Please do something, sir. Why do we need the police if they aren't going to help us? His father is fighting for his life. We don't know if he will ever see his father again. My wife's due date is close. She asked me why I didn't send money for hospital expenses. But I can't tell her about my plight here. You have no idea. I feel like dying. I am fighting for you, too. Don't lose hope. Jagan, we are immigrants here who contribute with our honesty and hard work. That won't go in vain. You little demon. You little one. How did you sneak past the CCTV cameras? That's a secret. You got scared this time, didn't you? Of course not. Kids like it when adults pretend to be scared. See how I fooled you! Uncle, you were the one who got fooled. Don't talk back! When my son returns, I'll ask him to chop off your ponytail. From tomorrow, I should just close by dusk. Uncle, it was your son who taught me how to scare you. Chozhan uncle isn't coming anytime soon. Apparently our people have some passport issue. They are at the police station. He must be there. My son? At the police station? Hello? - Chozhan, where are you? Diwali is round the corner. We've got a lot of orders for sweets. So I came here to buy milk in wholesale. Why do you ask, Dad? Milk? 'There's a problem at the police station, all our people are there...' this pint-sized adult told me you're there too. Police station? I'd never go there, Dad. It's risky, right? Sorry I called you for no reason and disturbed you. So, what's the special sweet this year? It's Halwa, Dad. - Great. See, he went to buy milk. That's the boy I raised. My son will never ever take any sort of risk. Let me tell you something else about my son. He always walks the straight path. Since childhood, he's never known what it means to walk the crooked path. He doesn't like getting involved in fights or protests. He knows the risk involved... even better than I do. Who are you? Stop! Chozhan, I hear the sound of glass shattering. That was his teeth. Check your GPS tracker immediately. This is too complicated. It's just two buttons! Space Bar and Enter. You can't manage that? Oh, right. Got it! Which way do I go? Right or left? Right. Where is the locker room? Continue going straight. The locker is straight down. ?? Jagan... What? - I'm hungry. It's not like I had biriyani and dessert. Scoundrel! He doesn't even notice us sleeping here and throws the garbage on us. Jagan, I have a doubt. What is it? You remember how they donated food to the Chennai flood victims? Yeah... Similarly, maybe someone took pity on us and threw some food packets? These are just plastic covers. Food packets? You wish. Dude, these are passports! Our salaries, too. Wait! Calm down, Muruga. Muthuraman... Our passports! Now we can take up any job we want. Look, that's Chozhan! Come on. Hello, Chozhan. Nasi Biryani for everyone. Grab a plate.

They came here to work, they should behave. So arrogant! What is it, Dad? You don't need to know about it. It will disturb you. Try me, Dad. You know something? Someone broke into that company and retrieved their passports. Do you know what a survey says? What? When people do such things, it really isn't their fault. They weren't raised right. I'm sure his father is a useless guy. What? You don't get it? His father is surely a good-for-nothing guy. Did you just laugh? Why do you laugh? Do you think the survey is wrong? I never said that, Dad. Then do you agree? - To what? That his father is a good-for-nothing guy. Fine, I agree. Good. Who is it? Chozhan Supermarket delivery. I'll buzz you through. Leave it near the TV. ?? I don't know what to do. I swear, I just want to run away to my hometown. My paper is due in two days. I wanted to look up this important research material... but it says it'll cost me about 10,000 SGD to download them. I tried to access it through through several university websites. It says "Access denied." They say robotic implant surgery is an advanced discipline. Should poor people never pursue studies in advance disciplines? I am just an immigrant student who lives with a friend here. My mother mortgaged our house and took a loan for my education. I can't tell her I need an additional 5 lakhs for the research papers. We cannot afford this. We are in so much loss. Can I talk? Can I talk? So you don't wish to be in business with us anymore? You want to cut all ties? But before you make your decision, have a look at this. For several years, China's population was greater than India. But now it's almost equal. The world's most populous country will be India. Moreover... you are an exporting country. India is an importing country. You can sell any Chinese crap, and our people would buy it. People would pay 200 rupees for something worth 20 rupees. If you put up a foreign label on that same object... they will even pay 2000 rupees for it. Are you going to miss out on this market? The ban on Chinese apps. Ban on imports. Anti-China movement. One person is behind all of this. Arundathi Mohan. India's Foreign Affairs Minister. But your company cannot stop her. And you're not able to bribe her. We don't want to incur any more losses. All these years, we bought out the ministers. Listen... When it comes to India... you'll encounter the odd honest politician every 40 years or so. So you want us to give up a hundred year old business? I have a solution. Look there. Hochin, a Japanese businessman, died in a car crash. Maria, an American journalist, died by suicide. Shahul, a Bollywood model, was found dead in his swimming pool. And many such others. But according to the police there... they were either accidents or suicides. But the underworld knows it... all of this was done by one Indian. Each one of these was a meticulously planned murder. What if Arundathi Mohan suffers a similar death... without arousing any suspicion? What? - He is right. How is it possible? Stop! This is a 100 billion dollar business. I want to call for a voting. Who doesn't want to hire him? And who wants to hire him? My research paper is pretty much done. I just have to type it out and submit it. Congrats! Your dreams are going to come true. Your mother is going to be so happy. But how did you? I don't know either. Someone from Chozhan Supermarket had come to deliver the provisions. I was upset, so... I buzzed him through while I was on a call with my friend. But my laptop was switched on. When I washed my face and returned, all those pages were open. Stop lying. Tell us the truth. I swear on Lord Murugan. See for yourself. He's left a sticky note. "People like you deserve to study medicine, friend." So sweet. But this is so unfair. I haven't completed my thesis either. Nor her. And her. How come only you get help? She got lucky. Let it go. No chance. He must be a hacker. Getting access to research papers is such a big deal. 1 kg lentils... ?? That guy? ?? Chozhan... ?? It took you so long for one delivery? Hello, I need to talk to you. Why are you changing your voice, dude? You came to my house and hacked medical research papers for my friend? Did he tell you that? How could a mere grocer do that? I think you've come to the wrong place. Same handwriting. I know you did it. Please help me too. Let's get one thing clear. I'm not the guy you are looking for. If you want some rice, you can buy it here. If you want some oil, help yourself. But I don't know anything about research... This is so wrong. Someone toiled night and day and spent millions to complete a research. You want to hack it for free? This is against the law. It is such a big risk. I'm right here. Why do you have to shout? It's closing time. You should leave. So you won't help me? Miss, he said it wasn't him. Stop pestering him. Exit. Chozhan, it's like what I said... she wasn't raised properly. Her father is a good-for-nothing idiot. She is a young girl. She made a mistake. Why are you getting so worked up? Are you out of your mind? She came to the shop and yelled at me. And you expect me to do nothing? Be quiet. I'll sort her out today. Buddy, we are in enough trouble as it is... There she comes. Don't go beyond yelling. Don't hit her. Ashvitha madam... What is your research paper topic? I'll help you out. I can take care of my research paper. I don't need your help. ?? Ashvitha madam, please don't say that. I can help you with anything. - Tell him to leave. Ashvitha... Ashvitha! Why hasn't she come yet? Ashvitha madam... please hear me out. Please trust me. Just tell me your research topic. Please stop for a moment. I've done you a huge favour. You tell me... Her research is about... Shut up! Tell me, please. Stop. Why are you going after that girl like a lost puppy? Do you really want to know? ?? You've got your salary now. Send it home immediately. Brother Ganesh, how are you? I am doing good. How is your kid doing at school? - Good. She uses the computer you assembled for her. She is always talking about you. Mate, I got a job too. Thanks for getting me this job at the gas agency. No problem. Let me know if you need anything else. That's who I am. I volunteer to help people. This girl came to me looking for help. How could I refuse? That's really wrong. What? You don't look like you want to help that girl. You look like you want her to help you with something. Don't waste your time. This isn't going to work out. She is furious with you. Come, let's start husking coconuts. - I've got another plan. What plan? Greetings. Firstly, Ashvitha, let me apologize to you. I know you are furious with me. But I will definitely help you. You are refusing to tell me your research topic. So I downloaded every research paper from your university in the last 10 years. ?? You and your friends can use the ones you need. But the link will expire in one hour. Just one hour? Hurry. - Oh, no. God, please help me. Ashvitha... Our three theses have been ranked in the top 3. Yay! Surprise! Thank you!

A boy or a girl? A girl for sure. I've even decided to name her Amaya. What if it turns out to be a boy? If it's a boy... It's okay. He'd still be my baby. But I sense a disappointment in your tone. If it's a boy, I'll name him Akash. Happy now? I must fight for my gender. Did you travel alone? - Yes. Can I drop you somewhere? No, it's okay. I can manage. Nice meeting you. - Nice meeting you. Oh, wow. Oh, hi! Are you staying here? Yes, but only for two days. The scan centre is very close. I have an appointment this evening. So we will know this evening if it's going to be Akash or Amaya. Now, even I am eager to know! If you don't mind, can we meet for dinner tonight? You can tell me the result then. Sure, no problem. How about we meet at the lobby this evening at 8 p.m.? That works. Your treat if it's Amaya, my treat if it's Akash. Deal? Buddy, she is so beautiful. She is so sweet. Last night at dinner... - Enough, just do your work. Why do you get so riled up whenever I talk about Ashvitha? She entered your life only recently and you make her your brand's model? Her face isn't going to suddenly get people to shop their groceries here. I've been with you for years now. Why can't you put my face on the hoardings? Pass me those green chillies. Fine, assume I do forgive you. But still... think about it, this isn't going to work out. What won't work out? Ashvitha is studying medicine. Think she'd understand the sacrifices you made for your father... and join you at this petty shop? You completed P.G and Ph.D through correspondence. You are a smart, qualified man. She won't let you work in this shop. Moreover, won't your father's character scare her away? My father wasn't always this way. My mother died when she was leading a local protest. That was when his fear started. The doctors say it's a complex phobia. He's done so much for me. So I decided to live my life the way he wanted me to, as long as he is around. Oh, no! Oh no! Jagan... Jagan... Oh, no... Chozhan, look at our Jagan. He is gone. You even got him a job. My wife's due date is close. She asked me why I didn't send money for hospital expenses. But I can't tell her about my plight here. You have no idea. I feel like dying. His wife is in labour at the hospital. He was planning to go home next week. Oh, dear. Gopi! We don't even care about the unpaid wages. At least get us our passports back. I'll bid them goodbye, and return home. Chozhan, look at him. What am I going to tell his father? He refused to send his boy to Singapore. Then he entrusted me with the boy. What will I tell him? Please move... Are all of you gone? All of you are dead? What am I going to do now? Babu... A gas leakage resulted in an explosion at a gas agency near the Serangoon Tamil Community. Eleven lives have been lost so far. Five are critical at the hospital. The reason for the gas leakage is still unknown. The police are investigating the gas agency. The government has announced a compensation... of 10,000 SGD for each of the victims. The cost of a life is a mere 5 lakh rupees? We can't even send their bodies home with that money. I was the one who got them those jobs. Chozhan, you did it with the best intentions. Who knew this would happen? Eleven young men. They worked day and night to send money to their families. Who can foresee accidents? Ours was a narrow escape. They're all at the hospital, or the mortuary. They probably haven't eaten. Let's go. Babu, I've cooked food at home. Distribute the food. Okay, uncle. Let's go. Stop the car. Why are we stopping here? One minute. Hey! Hey! Brother, they took all the bodies to the mortuary... why did they leave him behind? Oh no, this is the dog from the house upstairs. It was just fine even an hour ago. An hour ago? - Yes, brother. So he didn't die in the gas explosion? He died just now. I was a little occupied with work. Suddenly I see it lying dead. It's getting late. Let's go. - Wait. What are you doing? Babu, unplug the transformer fuse. Why? - Just do as I say. Babu, look at this paint. The gas didn't leak by accident. Someone leaked it on purpose. What does this paint have to do with the gas leak? A strong acid has been mixed with this paint. Joseph's gang does all the painting in our area. No one can touch a wall here without his permission. Where can we find him now? Joseph... That's my cycle. Thief! Hey, watch it. What the hell? Call the police. Joseph, I'm out of patience. I know you did it. Just tell me why. Tell me! Please don't hit me. I am a ganja smoker. You'll end up killing me. You know me. As long as I'm paid the right money, I ask no questions. A guy got in touch with me through WhatsApp. I don't even know his name. He promised to pay me 10,000 SGD. I did as he told me to. What did he tell you? He told me to paint a building. And I painted it. That was all. Tell me the truth. I'll tell you. Please don't hit me. He asked me to mix one muriatic acid into my regular paint. I swear I didn't know it would erode the gas pipe... and result in the building's explosion. How did he pay you the money? He gave me a list and asked me to buy those items from our area. After I bought and delivered them... there was money in the trash can, as promised. I took it and fled. Give me that list. Give it to me! Who gave you the money? We just want to know who he is. What is his name? Chozhan... Sir? - Remain seated. I feel he doesn't know anything else. But as usual, very brilliant investigation. He knew the exact location and dimensions... of the gas pipes from the building blueprint. It was a properly planned job. But I don't know the purpose of this attack. Could it be a terrorist attack? That remains a mystery. He has intelligently concealed the cause of explosion. He's made it look like an accident. Normally, terrorist attacks target big crowds. They claim responsibility too. Sir, did you look at this list I got from him? All these are wireless hacking tools. He dropped it off near our Tamil community. He has selected our area for a reason. Sir, Angel's new travel plan. We need to accommodate. Okay. I'll let you know if I get more details. Okay, sir. Chozhan, one minute. - Sir? You can go. - Yes, sir. Actually, the rules don't permit me to discuss this with anyone externally. But I'm making an exception with you. You know India's Foreign Minister, Arundathi Mohan, is visiting Singapore? We received her travel route a month ago. Due to the accident which killed a lot of Tamils in your area... she has suddenly changed her route to go there and offer condolences. The Singapore Government has approved it too. So she is stopping by your area before visiting the Singapore Ministry. I suspect this accident may have something to do with her visit. Sir, can't you stop her from visiting? I don't have any concrete evidence. I am going to send the complete case details... to my higher-ups and Indian security officers. They are the ones who decide. When is she visiting? 9 AM tomorrow. Moving towards exit. Walking to the car. Gurum... Ma'am, welcome to Singapore. Aren't you a Tamil channel? - Yes, ma'am. You can interview me in Tamil. You started out as a female social activist... got through a heart surgery... and now you are the Foreign Minister of the largest democracy in the world. We are really proud to welcome you. Can you tell us more about this visit? Thank you. Singapore and India have strong economic ties. The leaders of both countries wish to extend that to security ties too. So I am here to sign some agreements. We hear China is going to oppose these agreements. When one tries to do good... it is only natural to face resistance. What do you have to say about the accident in the Tamil community? Very unfortunate. Most of the victims were young people. I wish to meet the community and offer my condolences. No matter where Indians are, across the world... if they face any difficulties, our government will stand by them. Especially if Tamilians were to face a problem, I will be the first person to help them out. Thank you. - Okay, enough. Ma'am, one more question. No changes in Angel's plan. She feels it won't look right if she cancelled the trip to Little India. Sir, we are fully prepared. Due to the hacking threat... we've jammed mobile and traffic signals along Angel's route. We're monitoring all satellites. - Okay, copy. Angel's security. Over Singapore Police. Kindly update status and location. Angel is on the way. Gurum... - Yes, ma'am? My phone isn't getting any signal. Can you have a look? Madam, it's a security protocol. They warned us of a hacking threat. You can't use mobile phones or gadgets till we reach the hotel. This sort of threat is unprecedented in Singapore. Everything is under control. Angel will arrive in a few minutes. Why are we waiting here? Let's get back to work. We have work to do here today. Why? Something's about to happen. - So? You want us to be part of it? You nabbed that guy and told them everything you could. The place is buzzing with police and military. You have no work here! Someone killed our people right before our eyes. You want me to do nothing about it? Tell me. - Chozhan, I went through the list. These can't be used to hack long-range items like satellites. What then? Half these equipments are used only by the medical industry. Short-range items. The hacker must be within a 100m radius. 100m radius? What are you doing? - Wait. Angel has arrived at the spot. Angel is walking out. All units alert. Please help out, madam. Greetings to everyone. The incident that transpired here is a very unfortunate one. I have urged the Singapore Govt to conduct a thorough enquiry... and compensate the victims. We will provide you with all the help you require. Chozhan... Team... - Observing, sir. On the grounds of humanity... the Indian Govt will stand with you... These can't be used to hack long-range items like satellites. Short-range items. In the coming days... your... Get him. Drop the gun. Drop the gun now. Stand down. Do not move. Guards! - Freeze. Stay there. Careful. Angel has been shot. I repeat, Angel has been shot. Gurum, he is not a bad guy. Uncuff him. Sir! Sir, he is from our neighbourhood. I know the boy well. Let me talk to him. - That's the problem now. We even know that you two spoke yesterday. I am sorry. I have to do this. I've been ordered to take over the situation. You need to be detained. They say you run a grocery store. Your aim was perfect. Who trained you? ISIS? Lashkar e Toiba? Sir, with every second you delay... you are giving the killer a chance to escape. You shot the minister. And got caught with the gun. And now you are saying someone else is the killer? Within two minutes, your phone will ring. You will need my help then. Do it. I'm sorry, sir. - This is against the rules. Which organisation do you belong to? How long did you plan this? Answer me! Yes, doctor? Yeah, you go ahead. Sir, madam is stable. We've removed the bullet. And she is safe. Thank god. - But the important thing is... the guy who shot her didn't try to kill her. He saved her. What? Can you elaborate? Since the minister had a heart problem... she was fitted with a pacemaker last year. The doctors have an option to monitor it remotely at a particular bandwidth. When we fitted her with a new pacemaker, we analysed the old data. Normally the heart rate is 70-100. But when she was shot... the minister's heart rate went over 200. This is quite unnatural. Someone hacked her pace maker. Is it possible to hack a pacemaker? Sir, in 2010, when the US Vice President was under threat... they turned off the wireless control in his pacemaker. So it's very much possible. The guy who shot the minister knew something none of us knew. He took an accurate aim and hit the pacemaker. I just got to know that you have done us a huge favour. I'm sorry. But I need explanations. I need a glass of water. What? I need a glass of water. The first route you had planned for the minister was very safe. It would have been hard to carry out an attack. But to make her deviate from the route... he orchestrated a gas blast in our Tamil community. I knew I was taking a big risk. But I didn't have a choice. I put my trust in the Lord... and fired my gun. But there is a way for you to catch the guy behind this. I'm listening. A cup of tea. My hacker friend said the equipment's range is just 100 meters. So he must have operated it from within 100 meters. It must be his private space too. Taking all of this into consideration... the Grand Hotel which was behind her fits these criteria. There are electric wires till the 11th floor. No disturbances from the 12th floor. Based on their layout, it must be one of the last 3 rooms in the right wing. We can nab him if we go now. Is this a joke? You think he'd still be there, waiting for us? He must be breaking his head wondering why his signal got cut. To avoid rousing suspicion, he won't leave right away He will stick around like a tourist and check out only tomorrow. It's what I'd do. Gurum, take your team and go. - Yes, sir. Move, move. Keep moving. Moving up to 12th floor. Five men are on their way up. The minister's security team. I can't run away. And I won't run away. I've failed in such a big mission. For the first time in my life, the police have detected a crime of mine. I need to meet the cop behind this, face to face. Initiate Plan B. 1201... - Clear. 1202... - Clear. Freeze! Approaching suspect. Move. Those are our pictures, sir. Suspect confirmed. I repeat, suspect confirmed. Room number 1203. All evidence found. Shifting to police headquarters. Chozhan! How is Meera? You got married to her just 6 months back, right? It's better if you'd not open your mouth. It's Monday. His wife is eating lunch at the food court of her IT company. It's a crowded place. Anything could happen, right? Say another word, and we will shoot you and say you tried to escape. Aparna, your 6 year old girl. If she were to drown in the swimming pool, wouldn't it look like an accident? No one would suspect a thing. For someone who crafted such an elaborate plan... think I wouldn't know everything about everyone in the minister's security team? I planned this for months, you know? My men are waiting in all the locations. If I don't text them... one member from each of your families dies. The bank employee's wife... the driver Sharma's mother who lives in an oldage home... everyone is going to die today. But fear not. You have a chance to save your families. We will enter a tunnel in 800 meters. One of my men is dressed exactly like me. Detain him instead of me. Nobody will ever know about this except the six of you. It's that simple. You've got 10 seconds to make a decision. Once we cross the tunnel... even I won't be able to help you anymore. Chief, my wife... Stop the vehicle. Bharath, stop the car. Good decision, Chief. As always, pass it off as terrorism and close the case. I need you to answer a question. Despite my thorough plan, you tracked me down to my hotel room. Who cracked this case? The Singapore Police? Or an Indian security officer like you? Who, then? He runs a grocery in Little India. He runs a grocery? We are still waiting for the papers of 4 people. Two of them have expired passports. How can we hand over their bodies? Please understand. - Sir, please. The dead aren't going to cause any problems. Back home, their families are panicking. I'll get you whatever documents you need. Please release their bodies. Even if we did, they will stop you at the airport. It's not like we want to party with the bodies here. Watch your tongue! Chozhan... - Let go of me. What kind of talk was that? He is giving us the run-around. We migrated here to make a living. They don't let us live in peace... won't they even let us die in peace? Don't lose hope. Raising your voice isn't going to help. Call up Eshwaramoorthy sir. According to reports received just moments ago, an Al Qaeda terrorist named Rashid Khan ?? has been arrested for the assassination attempt on Arundhathi Mohan... You've done such a great thing. If not for you, he wouldn't have been caught. If you get a prize for losing, you'd lose the drive to win. You should earn your prize. I met your father, 'Risk' Ramalingam, before I came here. He billed me for this chocolate bar. Everything's changed in these 25 years. But your father is still the same. This bar of chocolate is still the same too. So far, I've completed 53 high-profile assignments. No one had ever traced anything. Not even a clue. But someone tracked me down to my hotel room... and got me into a police van. I wanted to meet the genius who did that... and shoot him down. But I didn't expect that it would be you. Do you remember the last day we spent together? We were sitting in the police station. Just like this. There were 5 convicts behind bars. A writer, two sub inspectors. The station clock showed 4:45. You were wearing a red T-shirt and a black sweater. Your left shoe lace was undone. I thought working at the grocery would have dulled your brain. Not bad. You made note of all those details, but you were so engrossed in the chess game... that you missed something important. I've always wanted to tell that to you in person. You have no moves left. Check mate. Rajiv... Dad's calling me. I'll be back. What is this? Dad, I was about to show that to you. Remember you taught me about photographic memory? It is so easy. There is a spot at Charring Cross Road. They have something new there, called an ATM. When people withdraw money, I can see the PIN on the glass reflection. Thirty PIN numbers in just thirty minutes. You know I can memorize 100 numbers in an hour. Then I tailed and pick-pocketed them using the stealth training you taught me. You rascal! Did I teach you all this so you could become a criminal? I wanted you to become a police officer. How did we give birth to someone like you? I'm calling the police... - Dad, don't. Don't call the police. I earned so much money! But you are calling the police instead of giving me a chocolate? Did you earn it? You rascal. Dad, don't call the police. When Chozhan does it, he is a genius. When I do it, you call the police? You are a criminal! What is worse is... you feel no remorse. Dad, don't call the police. ?? Dad, I need that money. Dad, listen to me. - I'm going to call the police. I'm warning you, don't call the police. I warned you! I warned you, didn't I? I told you not to call the police. You don't like it when your son is a genius, huh? But when it's the boy next door... "Well done, Chozhan!" "Very good, Chozhan!" Do you think he'd score a better rank than me? He is a natural, Patel. In two months, he learned everything I taught my son over the years. If he joins the police academy, he'll get a better rank than my son. He is so talented. Half a million rupees! Can he earn that sort of money? Go on and ask him! What do the police look for when they enter a crime scene? Chozhan! Chozhan, look. Someone stabbed my dad and ran away. Dad... He is an ex-CBI officer. About 4-5 men broke in and stabbed him. We are investigating it. Rajiv... to this day, I was looking for you. I wrote letters. I tried asking for your phone number. But no one knew where you'd gone. I missed you dearly because I considered you a friend. But you didn't feel the same way. You still have that ego. You killed your father because of that ego of yours. Your bad days have begun now. You killed these innocent Tamils for no reason. I'm not going to spare you. You will spend the rest of your life in Singapore Jail. Wait and watch it happen. Did you just say jail? Brother... The police led me to you, and even gave me a lift. During our childhood, you used to be the winner. But today, you are working in a grocery store. You have no idea how tall I've grown. I decide who gets to live and who dies in this world. I may work at the grocery. But you still lost to me. You are still basking in past glory. This isn't some childhood game. This is the real world. In this world, I am way more intelligent than you. Do you want me to prove it to you? You keep going on about the Tamil people! Those deaths were just a collateral for my assignment. But now I've made a plan to kill them. I'm challenging you. I will prove it to you today, at 6 in the evening. Among your beloved Tamil community here in Singapore... I will kill someone close to you. I am not leaving this country until I do so. Can you stop it? Do you think you can stop it? I'm timing it. Go. I told you. I didn't trust him. You Indians are useless. What are we going to do now? Yes, say something. - Stop! This mission is a failure. We understand. But more importantly, our involvement should not exist. I want to call for a vote. Who wants to eliminate him? ?? Where did you disappear for an hour after asking me to shut the shop? Who is this friend of 25 years? What is going on? It's a game. A game? - Listen... Grab that notepad and make a list. Of people near and dear to me. Tell me. Babu... My name is first on the list? Who else but you. - Thanks, buddy. What is this list for? It's nothing. I told you we are playing a game. He challenged me that he'd murder someone from that list. Did you say murder? It's a feud between the both of you. Either you kill him or he kills you. Don't use others as pawns. Until you resolve your problems, I'm off to my aunt's place in Trichy. You'd be at risk only if you go away. You'd be safer with me. Do as you wish. If I go now, he won't pay for my tickets. Fine, I will be safe because I am with you. How will you save the others? He's given me time till 6 PM. But I am going to assemble all my dear ones under one roof by 5 pm. Is this even possible? Let's complete the list first. Number 2 - Dad. Number 3 - Ashvitha. Number 4 - Brother Ramesh. A total of 230 people. 190 of them are part of our community. Another 30 people live outside the city limits. How are you going to protect all of them? I'll tell you. Hey, Chozhan. Hi, Ashvitha. Can we meet? Sure, when? 4 o clock. I'll come there. Great. So your plan is a romantic evening with her? Don't you get it? I should invite her personally for the engagement. Who is getting engaged? Ashvitha and I, of course. What are you saying? It's a surprise. This is the latest trend. Call these 230 people and ask them to come over. And tick their names off the list. What list? - Dad... Hello, uncle. You are 2nd on the list. Second on the list? Is this a lucky draw? - Something like that. You win, I'm the lucky one. I win, you are the lucky one. Are you still drunk from last night? Do you think I'd just let you win? Who is first on the list? - It's me. I am much older than you. Respect my seniority. Put my name first on the list. Do it! Shall I put him first? - Don't... What's your hesitation? Accept it. Accept what, Dad? Accept that your father is number one. I can't let him win. - You don't get it. Don't interfere. - Dad, don't... Make me number 1. - Please listen to me. I am always number 1. I'm getting engaged to Ashvitha today. You are getting engaged to Ashvitha today? You made this big decision while I took a short lunch break? What's the tearing hurry? Dad, if you don't approve, I'll cancel it. Get a refund for the wedding hall deposit. I didn't mean it that way. - No, Dad... If you don't approve-- - Stop it! Don't do everything he says! I'll smack your face. If you'd informed me earlier, I'd have made some arrangements. It just came as a surprise, is all. If you are getting engaged, I'm the happiest person. Chozhan is getting engaged? Who's the bride? I'll be there with a huge cake! She's gone on a school excursion. - Oh it's a surprise?

Chozha! I'm sure we'll find her. What happened? Pinky is missing. You said she went on a school excursion. Yes, I did. But her school teacher got into a road accident shortly before leaving. I saw the message and called up the school. They said the parents just picked up their children. They said Pinky was picked up by her uncle. Call up that uncle. We have no family in Singapore. Pinky doesn't have an uncle here. What are you saying? - Don't be afraid, calm down. Don't cry. We will surely find her. Hello, uncle. Your engagement is over already? We are getting punished for it. Our excursion got cancelled. Pinky, where are you? Your friend got me here. Want to talk to him? You like pistachio flavour, right? Here. Congratulations, Chozhan. Heard you got engaged. Did you have to take such a great risk to win in our contest? Anyway, that's your personal life. You managed to gather everyone there but you forgot this child. Take a peek outside. That's Pinky! Look up there. In the next 30 seconds, when the clock strikes 6... that weight of 4 tonnes is going to come crashing down. Not just Pinky. No living thing within a 5m radius will survive the crash. Mate, the crane is moving. What a brutal accident, eh? I warned you, this is not some childhood game. Goodbye, Chozhan. You lose. I win. Do something. The crane is moving. You just told me what you did... but you have no idea what I've done, do you? I have about 200 people who are dear to me. I knew you'd easily nab at least one of them. So I nabbed someone dear to you. I am a lone man. Absolutely no sentiments. No emotions. That's just a lie you sold to the world. Separate tickets and seats on your fight journeys. And then you meet at the hotel and made it look like a coincidence. You didn't want anybody finding out about her. Wow! - Oh, hi. Anisha Rajiv is your wife. The child she's carrying... is yours. If you want them back alive... Pinky shouldn't be harmed even by a speck of dust. Stop the crane. Stop the crane! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Uncle... Rajiv, you said you had no emotions! But the moment you heard Anisha's name, your eyes teared up. You don't know the full picture. You are talking rubbish. Where is Anisha? You thought you could track me down and challenge me... and I'd just sit back and pack groceries at the store? You knew the police were coming, but you still went ahead and got caught. Did you even think about me? You know I'm doing all of this for you. For your safety. When I know I have an enemy... I have to find out who he is. Sit. Unlike what I thought, he isn't some smart cop. An old rival. Leave tonight, Anisha. Here is your new passport and flight tickets. No, Rajiv. I am not leaving without you. No, Anisha. Right now, your safety is more important to me. You know I'd never say anything without good reason. As always, till we meet again in person... let's not communicate with each other. Who is this? - Complimentary chocolates, ma'am. Rajiv said it was an old rivalry. I knew it right then. What do you want now? What's the connection between you and Rajiv? He doesn't want anyone alive to know about it. Remember my warning on your deathbed. Here's the entire year's school fees. No, Rajiv. What if your father found out? Anisha, you know I'd do anything for you. Money is no big deal. But my uncle will ask me where I got the money to pay the fees. Make something up. Tell him your friends gave it, or that you won it in a competition. Okay. Thanks. Rajiv, what are you doing here? Looks like it might rain. Let's go. Go on. I'll see you tomorrow. The poor girl is an orphan. I just wanted to help her out. The buy in for this game is 50,000 rupees. Uncle... Darling, you are home early. Go in. I've made some coffee for you. What? Eyes on the card. Peter wins it! Calm down, man. What about this, then? Selva! Rake it in, mate. Peter, you owe us 2.5 lakhs now. If I don't get the money within the next two days... there will be hell to pay. Let's go, guys. Peter, what are you even doing? You are gambling with them when you are penniless! If you don't pay them back, they'd stab you in the streets. Have you forgotten what they did to Conoor Mani? But you see, Vinod... I was winning last year, right? Yes... I've had rotten luck these last 3 months. Vinod, set me up for one more game. I'll make it up in one game. What will you play with? They are well aware of your situation. If you don't have the money, they won't come. Vinod... Please invite them for one more game. Tomorrow is the 4th. Four is my lucky number. I'll win back everything I lost. You can't get rid of these debts by playing with low-stakes. If you play a high-stakes game, you can make up for everything you lost. Both those guys have a thing for the girl. I can setup a game even tomorrow. - I'll thrash you. You believe you will win, right? Then what's the problem? You can just use her name to invite them to the game. She is just a child. Fine, forget it. Do as you wish. I am off. Why do you allow such men into our home, uncle? Quiet, little one. How could you just watch him talk about me that way? Why are you so obsessed with this card game? Come here, little one. Come on. Trust me. Sit here. This is nothing to cry about. Who am I doing all of this for? I'm doing everything for you, precious. I've been taking good care of you for 10 years now, right? I paid your school fees, bought you a new uniform... I got you a new hairdryer, bag, shoes, perfume... But these last few months, I've been out of luck. One month, you take good care of me and buy me new things. But the next month, you can't even pay my school fees. Don't do this, uncle. Your gambling habit really scares me. Come on, little one. You sound just like the others. It's a game. It's mathematics. Those who work out the math, win it. Only those who don't know the math call it gambling. Even in this game that we just played... if he hadn't gotten the jack of clubs in this game... I'd have taken the entire pot. I'd have treated you like a queen. I'll win tomorrow. I'll win, little one. Peter will win. They've started gambling in the house now. Go to your class. Let me take care of this. I'm too scared to go home, Rajiv. Don't cry, Anisha. Hello, uncle. I've tidied up the house-- What happened, uncle? Your uncle is going through such a bad time. The one card that he didn't want from a deck of fifty two... was dealt to him again and again and again and again. Please save your uncle just this once. When I look at you, I feel so-- Come on, Peter. What is this? Why are you getting so emotional? She is not a little kid. Go on, man. Please forgive me. Shut the door. Don't be scared, baby. - Brother, please... This is nothing. - Don't do anything. Check who's at the door? Who are you, kid? Where is Anisha? I'm here to take her away. You are here to take her away? Who the hell are you? You should help him out. - Please don't... Get out of my way. Who is this kid? Touch her now. - What? I dare you to touch her in front of me. We've got a little gangster in our midst! Touch her. I dare you! Your turn to touch her now. I dare you. Touch her. No... - Scared? I came here to give you the money and take her with me. But your uncle crossed the line. Tell me, should I finish him off? - Calm down, boy. Tell me, Anisha, should I kill him? I've done so much for you. I am everything to you, am I not? Tell him, little one. Anisha, don't get swayed. This scoundrel placed you as the wager. Don't overthink it. ?? Shall I finish him off? Shall I finish him off? I knew it. She would never tell you to kill me. I am her mother and her father. I raised her. I just had an unlucky month. So I used my precious as the wager. When I win next time, I'll be the one taking care of her, right? Not you! Tell him, little one. Tell him. Little one! Little one, don't do this. I am your uncle. I just have to pull this thing? Yes, but hold it tight. What are you doing? ?? Then we went to Bombay. Calcutta from there. And then, Dubai. We made a lot of money. All the thefts and mysterious deaths that you saw in the news... we were probably behind some of it. But we stopped everything for a while, and started a new life. Rajiv, stop it! Sit. We just got a big assignment. It's a really big one. Anisha, we went over this. The day I found out you were carrying a baby... I gave up everything. Look... All these years, you worked hard to give me a good life. One last gig... Why can't you do this for Amaya? I'll do it for Akash. This Singapore mission is Rajiv's final assignment. But this is also his first failure. Since he got to know you were responsible for it... he's been itching for revenge. And now you've also threatened me at knifepoint. I'm not going to harm you. All I want is... Rajiv would do anything for you. Where is Anisha? Where is Anisha? Chozhan... Free Anisha. You are going to regret this. Step out. You dare to attack my queen? What will you do about it? Chozhan, try as you might, you can't touch my queen. First, let Pinky go. Uncle... Uncle! Let Anisha go now. I am not going to harm her. But I can't let you get away with this. Both of you are so worried for your unborn child. What about our 11 people who died? They had mothers. They had fathers. They had children. So far, only I know the truth that she is your wife. But I got the details of all your assignments from her laptop. The proof that she travelled everywhere with you. Her six fake passports. I found everything. If I pass this on to the Interpol, they will nab you both. You are short tempered. Your anger is making you foolish. You are an emotionally unstable person. I can't keep fighting you all my life. I'll tell you how you can save your wife. If you do that, she will reach home safe. I am listening. Tell me. Turn yourself in for the deaths of the 11 Tamil people. I'll send Anisha home safe with the same ticket you booked for her. If you try to cause any disturbance in the meantime... these details will reach the police. It is your responsibility to ensure Anisha leaves this place safe. I promise. Can I talk to my wife for a minute before she leaves? I don't like this, Rajiv. Don't worry about me. I don't care if I die. Don't spare him. We mustn't act with haste now. There are a thousand ways for me to get out of this mess. But what's important now is that you and our baby get out of here safe. You can trust him. Do this for Amaya. I'll do this for Akash. Oh shit. ?? This mission is a disaster. Okay, sir. Oh my god. He has a gun. What the hell? Freeze! Do not move. - Stay there. Stay still. Do not move. Suspect looks like a high value terrorist. Shifting to Changi Prison. Next. Next. Shrimps? ?? ?? ?? What does it say? What does it say? What does it say? Tell me. What does it say? What does it say? She is dead. I've nabbed someone dear to you. Hearing Anisha's name got you all teared up! I'm the only one who knows that she's your wife. I will never let you get away with killing my Tamil people. Your wife, and your unborn baby. You thought you could challenge me and I'd just pack groceries at the store? You'll rot in Singapore jail for the rest of your life. Oh my god, he is choking. Medic! Someone call the medic, it's an emergency. Someone call the medic. - Fast, it's an emergency. Hurry up. Put him on a stretcher. Oh my god. I'm sending your company one million dollars in bitcoins. I have a job for you. Ashvitha, let's shoot a boomerang and put it up on Instagram? Okay, post this. The boomerang trend died two years ago! They killed her? His wife... What? Someone killed his wife. - Whose wife? Faster! Ashvitha, call Ganesh. ?? Dear, your phone is ringing. Check it out. Hello, Chozhan? Brother, go to my place without wasting a second... ask Dad to pack immediately and bring him to the airport. What's wrong? He, too, would get afraid just as you are. Don't tell him anything except I told him to come there. His life is in danger. Hurry up, brother. - Right away, son. Where are we going now? He must be wild with rage. I must send the both of you and Dad away. They are trying to get on the car. Keep driving. We missed the target. I knew he'd escape. Hit the next location. Stop there. Hello? Who are you? I am talking to you. Anisha! Why does Chozhan want me to leave? How can I just leave suddenly? I'm sure it's nothing. Remember his surprise engagement? Must be something similar. Let's go. Load up. Pack and move. Yes, brother? Chozhan, your father and I are ready. But there is a vehicle at the front door. There are about 8 people with face masks and guns. Leave with father through the back door immediately. Okay. Brother, one second... Go to the 4th rack in the shop. You'll find a green paint bucket. Look for it. Yes, it's here. Pour it at the front entrance to our shop. Why do you want me to do this? Just do as I say, brother. - Okay, fine. Ramu, this way. The car is at the back. Let's leave from there. ?? We have started. We will be there in 20 minutes. Okay. - Okay, Chozhan. Was it Chozhan? You could have passed the phone to me. We are going to see him anyway. I think he was driving. - Fair enough. Talking while driving is a risk. Stay clear. Move in. Move, move. Keep moving. One o clock. - Clear. Eleven o clock. - Clear. Three o clock. - Clear. Location? - All clear. The supermarket is empty. His father escaped just a few minutes ago. I checked the CCTV footage. But unlike what you said, it wasn't Chozhan who escorted him. People from the Tamil community. I'll use them to get this done. Do as I say. Spread out. Move, move, move. My child... Let go of my girl. My baby. I can't get through. - Wait, let me try. Hi, Mr. Chozhan. I'm your pilot for the night. I see three passenger names. Ashvitha, Babu, and Ramalingam. We are ready for take-off. Ramalingam is my father. He will be here any minute. Okay. Someone please help me! They took my girl. What happened? ?? They took Aishu. They kidnapped my girl. Did anybody hear anything? No idea. We were sleeping. Suddenly we heard screaming. Why is everyone coming out? They kidnapped my daughter. Hello! Please be quiet. Whining about your missing family... I lost somebody too. The woman who meant everything to me is now gone. So I kidnapped a child from every single household. Do you want them back alive or not? You decide. I'm sure you are shocked. Understandable. Do you know who brought this upon you? It's him. None other than the man whom you take for an innocent grocer... Chozhan. All I've done is kidnap these girls, and you are already panicking. Do you know what he did? He slit a pregnant woman's throat and killed her. My Anisha was lying dead and deserted. This game started over a bar of chocolate. Now it's turned into a bloodbath. I want him. I want his family. My anger will abate only when I kill every one of them. Chozhan's father, Ramalingam... managed to escape only because of help from your community. Within the next half an hour, you have to bring him back here. You may think of calling police. I have no problem. I've already killed hundreds of people. I'd kill these children without a second thought. What is going on? You're actually listening to that lunatic ramble on? I am calling the police. - Sir, wait a second. Don't be hasty. He seems like a violent guy. Please think it through. - Come on! The police will take care of it. I'm calling emergency. How could he do this? My girl is just 9 years old. She is too scared to even step out in the dark. They had guns with them. They could kill my daughter! Please do what he wants. Please do what he wants. Don't believe his words. Let's call Chozhan first. He will give us a solution. Uncle, there is no one at his house and the shop. See! They got us into trouble and they've escaped. We're all talking out of fear and panic. Please think calmly. Even if we decide that the right thing is to do as he said... none of us know where Ramalingam is. I know. My husband left in haste after Chozhan called him.... and asked him to fetch Ramalingam. Call him. They kidnapped your daughter too. Call him immediately. Don't waste time. Call him now. Once Ramaligam arrives here, we can talk it out. He said he'd free the children once he sees Ramalingam. He is right. They are the ones involved in this mess. Let's talk it out in their presence. None of us have the courage to go to the police station. Please explain everything to your husband. Yes, Geetha? Don't panic and just hear me out. Okay? - What happened? Someone kidnapped our daughter. Not just her. Several children are missing. The kidnapper came on video and said... he would free everyone if we present Uncle Ramalingam before him. He threatened to kill them otherwise. Our girl must be so scared. Can you somehow get Ramalingam back here, please? If something were to happen to her... I'd die, too. Ganesan, what happened? Why are you crying? Tell me what happened. My heart is racing. My daughter had a seizure attack. We need to take her to the hospital, but they couldn't get an ambulance. You didn't get an ambulance? We have this car, don't we? Turn around. But Chozhan... - I'll talk to my son. The child is more important. Seizures are dangerous. Turn around. Just turn around, Ganesan. Only we knew about the connection between Anisha and Rajiv. So who killed Anisha? Rajiv's last assignment came from Beijing. ?? They transferred 5 million dollars to his account from an account in Beijing. Won't they get caught for transferring such a large amount? No way. All of it was in bitcoins. After Rajiv's attempt failed, they tried to kill him. How do you know that? There's been a transaction from the same account... to another account in Singapore. This is his profile. When we went to drop Anisha at the airport the other day... I saw him there. Guys, air clearance is only for 5 minutes. We have to on-board now. Otherwise, we will miss the flight. Who is it? - My wife. Talk to her. - She'd get emotional. Let's just get there quickly. What happened, Chozhan? He switched off his phone. Switched off? - I sense something is wrong. But both of you should leave. No, try to call him again. He must have lost signal or run out of charge. No, something is wrong. Leave before we lose the clearance. Excuse me. Please board them. Immediately. Buddy, take her with you. Come with me. - Both of you, leave. Why has everyone gathered outside? Forgive me, Ramu. Hello, Ramalingam. All of us are waiting for you. Waiting for me? - Oh, you don't know anything? Then where were you fleeing with your bags? You have no idea what Chozhan is up to? You want our children to die for his crimes? Uncle, they kidnapped our children. He says your son is the cause for everything. I am really scared. My son is the reason? What are you saying? - Hello, Uncle... it's been 25 long years since I last saw you! It's Rajiv. Do you recognize me? We got him here just like you wanted. Please release our children. Not so fast. There is one little task still pending. You, boy in the green shirt.... there is a gift box outside House No 7. Bring it. At exactly 2 o clock, kill those children. You scoundrel. We did everything you asked us to do. What more do you want? I only want him. Open the box, boy. Uncle... you don't have a role in this game. You can sit back. You have 15 minutes left before the clock strikes two. But you only need 2 seconds to do the job. It could be any one of you. I don't care which one of you does it. Kill Chozhan's father. Don't cry. You have nothing to fear. I've turned off all the CCTV cameras in this area. You can shoot him without fear. Just do this... and your children will return home safe. God promise. My daughter's life is most important to me. Raghu... What are you doing? Is he really going to shoot him? Yes, Pinky? Remember the man who picked me up from school? He said he was your friend too. His men have kidnapped 15 children from here. Your friend came on video and said... if someone kills Ramalingam Uncle within the next 15 minutes... he'd release the children. Uncle Raghu even has a gun out. I'm really scared. Pinky, don't panic. Just do as I say. - Tell me, Uncle. You see the electric box outside the shop? Yes, Uncle. Go and open the door. Uncle, it has a Danger warning. Nothing to fear. Open it. You'll see a big fuse there. Remove it. Uncle, all the lights have gone out. Do you see a glow outside the shop? Yes, uncle. Good. Do you see tyre marks? Yes, uncle. There are tyre marks. Follow it. Quick. Run! We don't have time. Sorry, uncle. My daughter's life is more important to me. I'm sure you'd think the same way if something happened to your son. People only care about their own families. If your son cared about us... he wouldn't have tried to run and hide. Uncle, the marks turn right towards Serangoon Road. Okay, Pinky. Go back safe. Uncle, aren't you coming now? But Ramalingam Uncle... - Pinky... Those 15 children they kidnapped are our family too. I need to save them first. My father will be fine. Go back safe. I can't do it. I can't... I can't shoot him. Ramalingam, you should have asked your son to come and sort out this mess. Because of you, we have lost our families. Scold me all you want. Beat me up. But I've considered every one of you my family for the last 25 years. Listen up, all of you. If all our children were to die because of me... kill me. I'll close my eyes. I won't know who shoots me. Shoot me dead. Shoot me dead! None of you have the courage to shoot him? Looks like none of you love your children. Fine, forget it. Let me do what I have to. Aishu... Aishu! That's our Aishu... Aishu... That's my Aishu. I can't stand the plight of those children. Shoot me dead. Shoot me dead. Kill me. Shoot me dead. Shoot me dead. I'll do it. I'll kill you, brother. Sorry, I am going to shoot you. You said you'd close your eyes. Do it. Close your eyes. Close your eyes, brother. Please close your eyes, brother. Close your eyes, brother. - Listen... I know you will not pull the trigger either. Give it to me. Let me do it. Give it! We came here to make a living. None of us have it in us to take another man's life. Let's not waste our time. Whatever happens, happens. Sentimental idiots. Let this be a life lesson to all of you. Kill them all. Load the guns, everyone. Who is it? - I don't know. I can't reach any of our soldiers. I also don't know where the children are. All units down. Hello, Uncle? Your people may be stupid, but you should have known better. Are you going to sacrifice 15 children to save your life? I killed my own father at the age of thirteen. I have no problem killing these children. Fifteen corpses shall land in your Tamil community today. How will you ever live with yourselves? Doesn't it prick your conscience? Fine, forget about that for now. I'll give you one final chance. If you could save these children yourself, would you do it? Or would you run away scared, like you always do? Tell me, what should I do? Go to your shop. And then... yeah, the second counter. Look up. You'll find a bottle with the picture of a rat on it. I know you are scared of taking risks, so I've given you the easiest way out. If you wish for the children to return to your community within 10 minutes... open that bottle and gulp it down. Mom! Mom! - Our children... My baby girl! Aishu! Are you alright? Chozhan... Forgive me. I didn't have a choice. I had to turn around. If I knew your daughter was in danger, I'd have asked you to head back too. Our people would never harm my father. We are one big family. Dad? Chozhan, my precious. I hope you are okay? I am fine, Dad. Bless you, son. Bless you. I am happy I got to see you. ?? Why do you say that, Dad? That's all I want. Dad, you are bleeding. Dad? Dad... Dad, what happened? Dad! ?? Someone please call the ambulance. ?? Forgive me, Chozhan. - Why, Dad? I consumed poison. I didn't know of another way to save the children. Twenty five years ago, you asked me for 10 minutes. We leave immediately. Take me to that house for ten minutes, Dad. I can get the men who killed Pari Uncle. If I hadn't tried to run away from that problem... we could have caught Rajiv while he was still a prickly little weed. He wouldn't have turned into this beast. I always discouraged you from taking risks, but enough of that. I may have raised you... but you are not like me. You are like your mother. Whenever anyone had a problem... your mother was always the first person to step forward. Back then, that used to make me angry. But as long as people like Rajiv exist in this world... We need people like your mother, and you. You are smart. You are talented. You are strong. Your father is your only weakness. No, Dad. That's not true. You will be okay, Dad. Dad? Dad... Dad, you'll be okay. You'll be fine! Dad, the ambulance is here. Please hold on. Be careful. Dad, the ambulance is here. Dad, you are my strength. Dad, nothing is going to happen to you. We will reach the hospital shortly. The ambulance is here... You are my real strength, Dad. I can't live without you. Dad, wake up. Just a little longer. I will save you. Brother, please call him... He will wake up to your call. Sister, please tell him. He will definitely wake up to your voice. Someone please say something? Dad, we are almost there. Please, let's go. Please don't leave me. Chozhan, it makes me so happy to see you in this plight. The sight of you crying "Dad, please wake up..." I can't take it off my mind. You saved all the children and made the whole community happy. But you couldn't save your own father. He is a fool. He was the same naive person I knew from 25 years ago. He thought he was saving the children, and... consumed the poison without hesitation. What did you say? You said my brain doesn't function when I get angry? What was it? Emotionally unstable. Aren't you angry now? Don't you wish to kill me now? We are equals now. I've brought you down to my level. Come at me now. I know you will come for me. Don't break your head trying to guess where I'd be. I'll just tell you. City Tower. 54th floor. Come now. Come on! Why did you kill Anisha? Why did you kill Anisha? Why did you kill her? I trusted you with her. Tell me. Why did you kill her? Why did you kill her? Why did you kill her? When we met as children, and we spent time together... I considered you my true friend. But why have you always had so much ego? Why all this rage? If you hadn't come into my life... I would have still had my father. I would have still had my Anisha. Since childhood, whenever something good happened in my life... you came barging in to screw things up. You killed your father. You started committing crimes. You put your wife and child under constant danger. My father was an innocent man. What was his crime? Defeat hurts, doesn't it? I felt the same. When Anisha died... I experienced the same pain. Oh god. Victory and defeat? You still think this is a contest? Yes! You know what's worse than death? Death with an unfulfilled vengeance. I killed your father and broke you. That's good enough for me. You are here to kill me, right? Let go of my leg. Let go! Let go! Let go of my leg. Yes, I am going to kill you. I am going to take revenge for my father's death. But the man who killed your wife... is still alive and well in another city. But you don't know that, do you? What are you staring at? I know that you got paid in bitcoins by the Chinese guy. And after your mission failed, he hired someone to kill your wife. But you didn't think it through, did you? Your brain didn't function because you were angry. You couldn't hurt the guy who killed your wife... and get your revenge, could you? Chozhan... you are lying, aren't you? Who is that guy? Tell me. Lift me up. Lift me up, Chozhan. Goodbye, Rajiv. Lift me up, man. Who is he? Dad, when we come here every year on Grandpa's death anniversary... why are you also laying out flowers for that guy? Mom says he was a bad man. He was a bad man. But when he was your age, he was a good boy. Him becoming a bad man, and me running a supermarket... both have one reason. Our fathers. I lay out these flowers to remind myself of that. I don't understand a thing of what you said. Fine, what do you want to be when you grow up? Why do you ask? Just tell me. How about a fighter pilot? Great! Actually, no... You know the uncle who operates the roller coaster at Sentosa? I want to be like him and ride roller-coasters every day. Sure! Or how about I become like you and work at our shop? Why? I'd get chocolates every day. That's a good job too. Great. Dad, you always say "okay" or "great" to everything I say. Tell me about your other wishes. I want to be like Batman and jump off a parachute. I want to be like Spiderman and fight the bad guys. I want to be funny like Shin-Chan and Kick Buttowski. And you know how Doraemon flies up in the sky? He flies really high?
