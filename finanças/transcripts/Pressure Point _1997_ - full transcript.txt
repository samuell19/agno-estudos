(MELLOW TUNE PLAYING ON PIANO) What happened? Emma fell down again riding that bike. She just won't quit on that thing, will she? I can't imagine where she gets her stubborn streak from. (CHUCKLES) She probably wouldn't fall if you gave her a few lessons. I will. As soon as I get back. Sebastian, you've been saying that since Emma was born. -Ow! Damn! -(HISSES) Here. Put your head down. -Man! -Sebastian, it's just some blood. I hate the sight of blood. You mean you hate the sight of your own blood. (BOTH LAUGH) This is it, Karen. A couple of weeks from now, I'm out of the systems business. You've also been saying that since Emma was born. You be good like I asked you, and I'll bring you back something special, okay? When are you coming back, Daddy? In about a week. And I want you to be good for Mommy, okay? -Okay. -All right. Take care of my baby, Mr. Paws. I love you, pumpkin. I love you, Daddy. -Wanna walk me to the car? -Okay. See you in a week. We are gonna make this work, aren't we? We are. Last trip, I promise. -I love you. -Me too. Be careful. -Oh, yeah. -(ENGINE STARTS) Computer conferences can be deadly. (HANDBRAKE RELEASES) -Bye. -Bye. (AIRPLANE FLYING OVERHEAD) -Good morning. -Hola. (SPEAKING SPANISH) -Good. And the equipment? -My meeting has been arranged for tonight. (ENGINE STARTS) (INAUDIBLE) Gracias. (HUMMING) The wick will burn for one minute. When the wick goes out, you have 20 seconds. And, Dellacourt, when this goes off, be somewhere else. (SPEAKING SPANISH) AMBASSADOR: Robert, I told you. I have financial and political commitments of my own. Well, Ambassador, the government's lack of enthusiasm for the President's position has him concerned. Your role in the UN is an important one. Especially in an election year. Ah. A little to the right of the center for your bleeding hearts, I suspect. (CHUCKLES) This could get you into the big game. All right. Contact your people. We will have a word. But later. It is, after all, my birthday! (ALL CHEERING) Elizabeth, where's your husband? On second thought, I'm glad you're here alone. And as lovely as ever. (GREETING IN SPANISH) AMBASSADOR: I wish to thank my many friends in the American diplomatic community for such an extravagant reminder of my impending old age. (ALL LAUGH) I shall never forgive you. (CHUCKLES) The people of our country share a great deal with the people in your own country. We both value family and friends, we strive to develop new opportunities for ourselves and our citizens. We both value a strong and stable world community with continued economic growth, free from the heavy hand of government. (ALL APPLAUDING) Today, the hand of government weighs heavily on the shoulders of our citizens. And the hand of crime waves more weapons in the face of the innocent and the unprotected. We live in a time where we must marshal our own support, to bring our own resources to bear upon the problem. (ALL APPLAUDING) AMBASSADOR: We must act responsibly, but we must act. The people in my country want your country to again be the example it once was. We want you to emerge from the upcoming election as the conscience of the free world. But, this is a birthday celebration, a happy occasion. So, my birthday present to you is my commitment to support that effort in any way that I can. (ALL CHEERING) (PEOPLE EXCLAIMING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Oh, thank you. Beautiful. Make the last wish. I would like to make a wish for the future of a strong Chile. (ALL CHEERING) -MAN: It's a bomb! -(ALL SCREAMING) (GRUNTS) (PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (SHOUTING IN SPANISH) (GUNSHOT) (WOMAN SCREAMING) (GUNSHOTS FIRING) (SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (AIRPLANE FLYING OVERHEAD) (TIRES SCREECHING) Freeze! Federal agents! Hands in the air! Hold it! Freeze! Federal agent! Put up your hands! Get 'em up! (DISTORTED SHOUTING) MAN: (DISTORTED) No! No! (GUN FIRING) (WHISPERING) Oh, God. I'm so sorry. KAREN: You lied about all of it. You kill people. For the government, Karen. For the United States Government. That's not what they say. For God's sakes, what did you think they would say? (WHISPERING) How could you? How could you lie? How could you kill? How could you do this to us? I didn't do this to us. I did this for us. I'm a soldier. When I came back from the service, they offered me an opportunity. -An "opportunity"? -Please don't. An opportunity for what? To become a murderer? Please. I don't know what to say. What were you gonna do for career advance? Become a serial killer, then a mass murderer? Now Mr. Dellacourt, why would the US Government want to kill one of its own ambassadors? I was briefed he was an arms dealer. Preparing to sell stolen US military supplies to one of our enemies. CIA operatives in the field couldn't get close to him. Apparently I was a last resort, but I never fulfilled the contract. You never fulfilled the contract? I didn't kill the Ambassador. I aborted the mission. Someone else killed him. So you've said, repeatedly. But the Ambassador is definitely dead. And by your own admission, you accepted the assignment. Who was the man who led this operation, who gave you your orders? You know I can't tell you that, Counselor. Why not? Because my life and my family would be in jeopardy. I simply can't tell you. Ah. Now, Mr. Dellacourt, you are aware that the Central Intelligence Agency has absolutely no record of your employment or involvement with them ever. They don't even know who you are. Of course I'm aware that that's what you would be told. What else could they tell you? It's the only thing they would tell you. Ambassador Ramirez was not an arms dealer, Mr. Dellacourt. In fact, very far from it. He chaired the UN Council on international terrorism. And was a close advisor to our own President. FEMALE REPORTER: Sebastian Dellacourt was sentenced here today at Federal District Court for the assassination of Enrique Ramirez, Chilean Ambassador to the US. Dellacourt will serve a life sentence without possibility of parole in a maximum security prison. KAREN: It's been three years and two appeals. I need to move on. Emma needs to move on. I don't know you anymore. I'm not sure we ever did. You led a life apart from us. A dangerous, cruel life. You're a stranger, Sebastian. There is a part of you that is very ugly. -Karen, if you just... -No, listen. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life. I'm filing for a divorce. Please try and understand. We have to get on with our lives. Emma has to stop crying over her daddy every night and I need to stop crying over you too. I need you to understand. (WHISPERS) I'm sorry. Karen, please don't. Karen, wait. Please wait! (YELLS IN FRUSTRATION) (SIGHS) (SNIFFS) (GROANS) (DOOR CLOSES) Mr. Preston, one bad apple, can spoil the whole bushel. My father told me that. If this country wants to be great again, if we want to save the... ...whole bushel, (INHALES DEEPLY) then we need to find the rotten apples and destroy 'em. Before the rot spreads. That'll leave us with a clean, wholesome society. A new world order of perfect apples, Mr. Preston. I'd like you to think about that. I'm gonna leave this right over here. I, uh, suspect you'll get hungry sooner or later. (ANNOUNCER SPEAKING ON PA) You knew the risks, Della. You hung me out there, Neil. You were hung out there from the first. It was a sensitive operation. The political ones always are. I couldn't help you then. You were too hot. You abandoned me. Well, I am here. -And I can help you. -How? Can you give me my family back? Can you return my daughter's birthdays? No, I can't give you any of those things, but I can give you a little something. And what exactly would that be, Neil? Your freedom. Two agents have tried, but they've come up short. And worse than that, they've disappeared, but you, you're better than both of them. And you've got nothing to lose. So, I do one more job for you and what? I get a pardon? No, we were thinking more in the lines of an escape. (CHUCKLES HUMORLESSLY) I don't think so, Neil. You think I wanna spend the rest of my life on the run? Oh, you wouldn't be on the run. You'd be an escapee, who, because of some bureaucratic sleight of hand, no one would be looking for. Federal officials will take over from the locals on the search, and conveniently forget you even existed. No, I don't think so. I'm done with you, and I'm done with the company. You're not worth it, Neil. And your perverted sense of values aren't worth it either. Well, perhaps not, but maybe what's left of your family is. I mean, Emma is growing up. What is she, 9? 10 now? She told me to give you this. Well, think about it. Like I said, you got nothing to lose. I'll freeze in hell before I help you, Neil. Do you hear me? Well, if you are interested, perhaps Mr. Paws can tell you what to do next. -(DRILLING) -(LOCK SPRINGS) (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) (DOOR OPENS) (MEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (DOOR CLOSES) MAN: Remember the fact that second-hand smoke can cause a wide range of health problems. MAN 2: So what the hell do you call that? MAN: Those guys. MAN 2: It's a damn shame a couple of hard-working men like you and me gotta come down here sneaking cigarettes like common criminals. We got baby rapers up there, sittin' around in air-conditioning, playing video games with themselves. It's not right. Hey, I understand how you feel. I don't like being subjected to this treatment myself. I worked here for the past 15 years. However, unlike you, as I watch this institution fill up with the dregs of society, it instills confidence in me, but, we gotta keep 'em healthy. MAN 2: For what? They're useless. Job security. That's why you're the boss, Jimmy. What's this? It's not mine. MAN 2: No one escapes, bear. -Go get 'em, Dale. -(GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) (DOOR CLOSES) What the hell? Jesus! Call it in, Jimmy! The phone line's been cut. (COUGHING) (PANTING) (GRUNTING) (PANTING) (BRAKES SCREECHING) (YELLS) (GRUNTS) Where is he? (KEYS JANGLING) NEIL: It's beautiful, isn't it? Imagine, first they wanted to tear it down, now they want to restore it. I like it the way it is. It reminds me of Eastern Europe. Elegant. Battered. A bit like us, old friend. Things were simpler then. There was some honor in what we did. As it is, I thought it would make an appropriate setting for our little drama, yes? Oh, bravo, Neil. You've certainly outdone yourself here. All the world's a stage, every man and woman merely players. Has it come to this? Little bit of theater for the pleasure of our masters. Why didn't you help me when the Ramirez assignment went bad? You were compromised. Yes, I was compromised and the question is how? There weren't supposed to be any innocents there. The hit was too public. And somebody else obviously had a present for the Ambassador. And the fumbling Feds. Where the hell did they come from? They couldn't find a puddle in the rain and they certainly couldn't find me, unless they knew exactly where to look. The whole assignment reeked, Neil. I don't know what happened, Della. You were the professional. You were the best. You got sloppy and you got caught. You were supposed to fix the problem, not become one. What do you think this business is, huh? (CHUCKLES) We don't have a pension plan. We don't have profit sharing. We don't have a killers ball every Christmas. And we don't have somebody to cover us when you screw up! Hell, it's not a job at all. It's a way of life, you know that. As it is, we did get you out. All right, Neil. Here I am. I'm out, you helped, and the deal was one last assignment. So, what is it? Good! Here's the file. You are really going to love this one. It's right up your ally. Undercover. Professional marks, tough, well-trained competition, plenty of room to operate, and I hear Vermont is spectacular this time of year. Vermont? What's wrong with Vermont? Too many cows. Well, fortunately this isn't about cows. And it's not about what you want, either. It's not about your loyalty to the company or the common good. And it's definitely not about saving the world for democracy, no. It's about you owe me, Della. It's about paying debts. It's about staying out of prison. It has to do with you protecting what's left of your family. You have no choice. Maybe not, Neil, at least for the moment, but if anything goes wrong, anything at all, you and I are gonna share one last dance together. There's a particularly zealous militia operating out of a company called Freedom Construction. It's run by a clown named Arno Taylor. He fancies himself as one of the original Green Mountain boys. (CHUCKLES WRYLY) Indications are that they're stock-piling weapons and explosives, and it seems they have more than a political agenda. They have a plan. And it's dangerous. And we wanna know what it is. There's a vehicle downstairs, keys are in it. Everything else is in the file. Contacts, locations, support, everything you need and, Della? No one's looking for you now. Don't give them a reason to. (EMMA PLAYING DO RE MI FA ON PIANO) (COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Can I get a cup of coffee, please? MAN: Nice shirt. Hey, do they make shirts like that for men, too? (SNIGGERING) You partial to cows? I guess you can say that, yeah. Yeah, I wonder if he's partial to sheep, too. (MIMICKING SHEEP BLEATING) Don't mind them. They got too much time on their hands, and not enough brains in their head. It's an annoying affliction, but it ain't deadly. Could be. You see that? Told ya he liked sheep. Shut up, Elliott! I believe that man is mocking us. What do you mean, "he's mocking us"? He's making fun of us, stupid. You gentlemen live in the neighborhood? -Uh-huh. -And what about it? I think we're gonna be neighbors. And I'd love to buy you a cup of coffee. What are you... -(LAUGHS) -Get him. Go get him. You! Where did he go? (SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (SCREAMS) Come on. Federal. Federal. Hit him! Hit him! (GRUNTS) -You want this? -Come on. All right, all right, everybody. Just stop right where you are. Come on. You boys don't move a muscle! What are you talking about? Shut up or you're going in. Oh, my God! That flatlander, he come over here ... -What are you doing? -Son of a... You are a dead man! You are a dead man! I'll catch you later! Have a nice trip! What the heck is this all about? All right, that's it. You boys get lost! -Is this my tax dollars at work? -Get lost! -Hey, hey, hey. -Look! You're gonna go to jail. Someday we'll have a real cop in this town. (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Have a nice day! Get lost! MAN: Look out, there's purse-snatchers over there. So, let me see if I understand this, officer. You're letting them go? Well, I admit, the odds didn't look so good, but the results weren't what I was expecting. Seems to me they sustained most of the damage. Those boys are bad news. Why'd you mix it up with them in the first place? Just for the taste of it. (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) Okay. What's your name? Del Sebastian. -Address? -Wilmington, Delaware. That's it? Just Wilmington, Delaware? That's it. Wilmington, Delaware. A place to be somebody. -Excuse me? -Nothing. I need some sort of address, Mr. Sebastian. I don't have one yet. You're a drifter? No, I just arrived. I'm looking for work. I just got here five minutes ago. Great first impression, huh? Well, I would have chosen something a bit more low keyed myself. -You know, Officer... -Cole. I think there's probably very little that's low-key about you. Speaking of that first impression, Mr. Sebastian, there were three of them and one of you. Now, I know those boys. All together they got about one slightly damaged brain, but they are young, they're tough and they've been in their share of fights. So why is it that I come screaming in here to save your life? Two of them are already on the ground, you're standing there with a six-pack of Coke, and you haven't even broken a sweat yet. Now, if I print and process you through BCI, am I gonna find out you're some sort of killing machine or something? (LAUGHS) I don't think so, Officer. It's really very simple. A couple of tours in the military. I took it fairly seriously for a while. Hell, I was trying to stay out of their way 'til you could get here. (LAUGHS) Right. Except you didn't know I was coming. Okay, you can go, but you've been warned. -Now you stay out of trouble. -I will. -And by the way... -(CAR DOOR CLOSES) You think you can spare one of those weapons? Sure, why not? This one here is on very intimate terms with young Jethro's nose. Thanks. Uh, one more thing. Where are you staying? I don't know yet. -That's right, you just arrived. -Yes. Employment? Like I said, that's why I'm here. I'd heard that a local construction company... I think Freedom, is looking to hire. (LAUGHS) You're kidding. Why? Mr. Sebastian, those young men you just manhandled work for Arno Taylor at Freedom. Look, you haven't really broken any law here and I can't just tell you to get out of dodge, but they're a bad bunch, and you seem like a nice enough guy. Maybe you should reconsider. Is that official advice, Officer? Yes. Yes it is. -Then I will. -Good. (ENGINE STARTS) (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) -Hey. Hey, look who's here. -What is it? Sheep boy. Hey, look who's here. Come on, I don't want any more trouble. Haven't you guys had enough? You should've thought of that before you came in the yard. Sheep boy! (GRUNTS) Hey, hey! What is the matter with you, huh? Huh? What's the matter with you? You a slow learner? Is that what it is? Whoa, gentlemen! Who the hell are you? This boy right here, boss. He just seems to wanna find trouble. Mr. Pete, please. I wasn't speaking to you. My name's Del Sebastian. What can I do for you, Mr. Sebastian? I heard you were hiring. I might be. At least we should talk about the possibilities, before you do any more damage to my crew. (SIGHS) So, you're looking for work. Do you always present such an aggressive first impression? Well, I seem to lately, Mr. Taylor, although I generally prefer to think through a problem before I'm forced to attack it. That's sound reasoning, Mr. Sebastian. What kind of work are you looking for? Well, I'm licensed on most heavy equipment and demolitions. I can take orders and I know how to do my job. And I'll give you an honest day's work for an honest day's pay. Where'd you get your experience? Military mostly. First with the Army Corp Stateside, later as a ranger with the Third Battalion. I served in Vietnam. That would be where you got your expertise in demolitions? Mmm-hmm. -Where in 'Nam did you serve? -Mekong Delta. Well, your qualifications are adequate, and we can always use another hand in our modest effort to build a better America. Yeah, I was hired this morning. No, no problem at all. Right. I'll let you know what I find out as soon as I can. You do that, but remember, Taylor is very sharp. We need this, but you can't afford any more mistakes. (LINE DISCONNECTS) (BEEPING) (WHISTLES) Hey! Taylor wants you over at Springfield Bridge this afternoon. We're gonna blow some bedrock. You know how to get there? -I'll find it. -All right. Go see Walter over in building four and get some detonators. Get what you need and then get on over there. Right. (BIRD FLAPPING OVERHEAD) (BARKING) Nice doggy. (BARKING CONTINUES DISTANTLY) SEBASTIAN: Hello? Hello? Hello? Jesus Christ! -Okay... -Who the hell are you? I didn't mean to scare you, Walter. You know my name? Who the hell are you? Are you from the bowling alley? Bowling alley? Yeah, a pair of shoes are missing. They think I stole them. No, no. My name's Del. I'm the new guy. -Yeah. -I'm looking for building four. I need some detonators. -Oh, building four, right. -Right. Yeah. -You found it. -(LAUGHS) Right. -What do ya need? -I need some detonators. -Detonators. Not a problem. -All right. I got what you need. Here you go. Got 'em. Actually, check this out. State of the art. Nice, huh? Top quality. You know explosives? -Beautiful. -Yeah, beautiful. But we won't waste those on the Springfield job now, will we? -No. -Mmm-mmm. I got what you need. Yeah, take some of these. You'll need some of those. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! (CLATTERING) Del, Del. Ever see one of these? Can't say as I have. It's a dead man's wheel. The old time explosive guys used these. Remember dynamite, Del? They just dial in the job, big building, little building, small hole, big hole, tree stumps, boulders, outhouses. (LAUGHS) -Whatever. Dead man's wheel. -Right. So, why do they call it a dead man's wheel? Oh. 'Cause they weren't always accurate, Del. (LAUGHS MANIACALLY) -What's in here, Walt? -No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. "Authorized personnel only. Keep out." This means Y-O-U. I'm the only one with the key. Not supposed to let anybody in here. -You wanna see? -Love to. (LAUGHS) Okay. (CLATTERING) (DOOR UNLOCKING) (WHISPERS) Be quiet, quiet, quiet. -(WHISTLES) -Yeah. (LAUGHS) It's something else, isn't it? -Definitely top shelf, Walt. -You betcha. Mr. Taylor only gets the best stuff. Yeah. This is only one of my buildings. I got four. Yeah. A lot of this stuff is going out of here tomorrow. Big job. SEBASTIAN: Yeah, I think Mr. Taylor actually mentioned it. Where was that again? WALTER: I don't know. The Inquisition doesn't tell me. I think it's in Washington. Yeah. -Big bang stuff here, Walter. -Oh, yeah. Yeah. Big, big bang stuff here. Want a cigarette? You know, I think I'm going to pass on that. But thanks for your help. I gotta get these back. Suit yourself. Come on. (CAR DOOR CLOSES) (ENGINE STARTS) (ENGINE STARTS) Well, Mr. Sebastian. Planning a trip with the boss? What's going on? Isn't that Freedom Corporation's hangar down there? It is indeed. So what are you doing up here? Today's my day to play guard dog. -For Arno Taylor? -Who else? -Why? -Well, he asked me to. Apparently, one of his disgruntled clients is a bit of a wacko, so he wanted me to follow him up here just in case the guy shows. (LAUGHS) You're kidding. Sounds a bit paranoid, huh? But it's tough to say no to the boss. Well, why didn't he just call us? Well, that had something to do with cops in skirts that didn't instill confidence. -His words, not mine. -Okay. So, um, I was kinda wondering... Yeah? What does one do for fun in this town? Hmm... (CLICKS TONGUE) Do you bowl? Bowl? Big ball? Heavy? That? Not recently. Well, that's about it. I see. Well, in that case, Officer Cole, would you like to go bowling with me tonight? Sure. As long as I can pay my own way. No problem. In fact, I'll do you one better. You can pay my way as well. (LAUGHING) Okay, deal. Uh... I gotta go. My boy is on the move. -I'll see you tonight. -Looking forward to it. -Around 8:00. -Okay. (ENGINE STARTS) (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) Sebastian Dellacourt. Jesus. (MUMBLES) (DOOR OPENING) Fugitive. Oh, my God. Check the entire facility. Well, well. You're resourceful. Perhaps even more resourceful than we ever thought. (MACHINE HUMMING SOFTLY) (SHOUTING) (PHONE RINGING) County Sheriff's office. What? (PHONE RINGING) MALE OPERATOR: Capital Florists. SEBASTIAN: Stratton Records, please. OPERATOR: One moment while I transfer you. (PHONE RINGING) Stratton records. SEBASTIAN: Martha. Yeah, this is Martha Stratton. Can I help you? -Martha, it's Sebastian. -Sebastian? Sebastian Dellacourt? (LAUGHS) Exactly how many fans named Sebastian do you have? MARTHA: Only one, hon. Jeez, I can't believe it's you. I thought you were... Well, it's great to hear you voice. What can I do to help you, Sebastian? I... I need access to a file. Something Neil Kennedy's working on. (SIRENS BLARING) (SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (ENGINE STOPS) (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) (SIGHS) (PHONE RINGING) -Martha. -Very fruitful, but very strange, Sebastian. -How so? -Best I can tell from a quick glance is your Freedom Corporation is a front for a very active militia group, headed up by one Arno Taylor. -Hard, right-wing politics. -(TYPING) These guys are not the type to let their votes do the talking. Lots of direct political connections. Looks like Ambassador Enrique Ramirez was one of many strong supporters. Ramirez? MARTHA: Yup. Seems Ramirez provided some very outspoken support for the kind of conservative agenda these guys like. Huh. It's possible he had some first-hand contact with the infamous Arno Taylor himself. There's a surveillance photo in here ID'ed as Taylor Santiago. It's dated the day before Ramirez was assassinated. What about Neil, Martha? Well, like I said, he's been cheek to jowl with this bunch for a long time. Could be he was just keeping tabs on 'em. Nothing beyond that, Sebastian. Lots of dates, places, descriptions. But all is one step removed from Neil. What's going on, Sebastian? I don't have any idea, although the plot definitely thickens. (GRUNTING) Mr. Dellacourt, I've been expecting you. Did you kill both of my men outside? No. But one of them won't be spouting any more political rhetoric for a while. The incident at your house. It was just to get your attention. I knew it wouldn't stop you. Oh! Thanks. For this. (SCOFFS) Of course. My fingerprints. Yes. You will be held responsible for the chaos at the Congressional Office Building tomorrow. Fingerprints on the detonators, a few fibers from your clothes, spread nicely around. The next government killer, with an ax to grind... ...Will at noon tomorrow blow up the Congressional Office Building in DC. Why, Taylor? America's dying, Mr. Dellacourt. The infrastructure is decaying. The educational system is antiquated. Drugs and violence have corrupted our humanity. The rich get richer, and the poor suffer every consequence! And the politicians, every year, leave us deeper in gridlock and debt! Nothing changes. The people have to take control now. We've got no time to waste and nothing to lose. Only lives. This is a bold statement, Mr. Dellacourt. You're going to help to liberate a corrupt and greedy nation. Tomorrow will be a new day of independence. My God, Taylor, listen to yourself. You sound like just another bloated politician, beginning to believe his own lies. God, no. Please. Nothing so impotent and useless as that. I expected you to see something more. What I see, Mr. Taylor, -is a mad man. -Ah. Let me guess. Your plan is to make the world safe for democracy by ridding them of a deranged mad man. My thought exactly. I would hold that thought a second, Della. -(SCOFFS) Neil, what a surprise. -Mmm! I was wondering what part you play in this little comedy. Oh, a long and distinguished one, my friend. Beginning with Ambassador Ramirez, no doubt? (CHUCKLING) See, Taylor? Told you he was good. Yes, that fool Ramirez was supposed to provide us with international funds and supplies. And he did. Until he started whoring with liberals like Robert Blanton, and then of course, he had to sell us out. You were supposed to send him off with a spectacular birthday, but you lost your nerve. -It was you, Neil. -Well, of course it was. It was simple. Execute the Ambassador and make you the patsy. Now give me the gun. Death comes soon enough without rushing it. (BREATHES DEEPLY) (INAUDIBLE) Seems we have more guests. Have Mr. Dellacourt join us, if you would, please? ARNO: Hold it. Everybody in position? In position, sir. First martyrs of the revolution, Mr. Dellacourt. Open fire. (SEBASTIAN YELLING) Police! Freeze! (GRUNTS) (SCREAMS) (SCREAMS) (GRUNTS) (FLIES BUZZING) Remove our former guest. (EXCLAIMS DISGUSTEDLY) (SIGHS) My poor apples, Mr. Dellacourt. I'm sorry, but we're gonna have to be going. The journey to Washington is a long one, and we have a busy day tomorrow. -Hang in there. -(GROANS) Yeah, not to worry, Della. Somebody will find you. And what's left of you. I did leave you an apple. -(DOOR CLOSES) -(GRUNTING) (SIGHS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) -(LEAVES RUSTLING) -(PANTING) -(TWIG SNAPS) -(GASPS) (BREATHING SHAKILY) Oh, God, I've never been so happy to see a cop. Just who the hell are you, anyway? I heard shots. What happened out there? I'm about to ask you the same thing. Terrorist militia opened fire on us and I was the only one wearing a vest. -And I'm glad you were. -Okay, it's your turn. Arnold Taylor and Neil Kennedy, my former boss at the CIA. They're gonna blow up the Congressional Office Building today at noon. Where are they now? They're on their way to Washington with a truckload full of explosives. I saw it at the compound earlier but that was hours ago. You gotta to get me down from here. No! Why should I believe you? -Have you looked in building four? -Not yet. It's loaded with explosives. -So? -Sam, we don't have time for this. If I'm right, at noon today, the Congressional Office Building is gonna be nothing more than a pile of rubble. If I'm wrong, arrest me, shoot me, it won't matter! Now you've got to trust me. (TIRES SCREECHING) Damn! Now what? How the hell do I know? You're the company man. Think of something. Who are they? -Federal marshals. -Federal marshals? I called them after I got your file through BCI. Terrific! Then you think of something. FEDERAL AGENT: I got the papers right here. COLE: He's been set up. There's a bomb that's going to go off in DC, and we have to get there. -My documents clearly... -I don't care about your documents! -I'm sorry. -Look, you're making a horrible mistake! Sebastian, I tried to explain the situation here. Unfortunately, there is no explaining your situation. You're a federal fugitive. They think they have their conspiracy if they have you. Likely story. They're not gonna do anything about the bomb. No, Kennedy called them before I did. He told them that you were the terrorist. They think if they have you, there is no bomb. They're the only ones that can do anything about this now. Sheriff Cole, assist my men to Freedom Construction will you, please? (SIGHS) Sorry, but I'm gonna have to insist the suspect stay -within my jurisdiction for the time being. -Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's a material witness in an ongoing investigation. Now if you'll be so kind as to remove yourselves from this helicopter. We'll be borrowing it to further aid in that investigation. -You're kidding. -Do I look like it? Lady, you're breaking so many laws here, you're gonna spend more time in jail than this guy. Thanks for that insight, Marshal Gaines. Now get out! Now! Get out! One more thing. The keys for the cuffs. Give her the keys. COLE: Now that we've got wheels and a probable jail sentence, do you have any idea where we should take this thing? The truck is probably three or four hours ahead of us. We could probably reach them before they get to Washington. If we follow the main roads, we should be able to spot the truck. Great, but I don't think this guy's got a road map in here, do you? I had a small fire at my place and most of my maps got singed. But I think I know where we can find one. (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) (CHOPPER WHIRRING OVERHEAD) (STAMMERING) I don't got any high test, mister. -I need a map. -Map? Hell, I got maps. -I don't got any high test! -That's all right. Where'd you get the windshield? The windshield? (SOFTLY) Shit! We're cutting this a little too close, aren't we? There it is! Move in on it. Do it! This is 48 Sierra Victor. This is Federal Marshal Gaines. You're instructed to land immediately. Do you read me? This is Federal Marshal Gaines. Did you read me? You're instructed to land immediately! Marshal Gaines, I see you found yourself another lift. Good. So, as long as you're in the neighborhood, why don't we rendezvous at the Congressional Office Building. Over and out. GAINES: Land immediately... Do you read me? You have violated federal airspace and you will be shot down! Now... Now land! Oh, great, they spotted us. (GUNSHOTS) -(GLASS SHATTERS) -Whoa! Jesus. Keep flying! Hey, lady, I'd rather take one of your bullets than get shot down. We're landing. Where are you going? I need some transportation and you need to stall Gaines as long as you can. (TIRES SCREECHING) MAN: Hey, what's going on? -I need the car. -What do you mean, "you need my car"? -No, you're not getting my car. -Give him the car! (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Okay. Uh, it sticks in third. (REVVING) (HORN HONKING) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) (YELLS) (CHOPPER WHIRRING OVERHEAD) There he is. All units, we have the subject spotted, heading towards the mall. MAN 2: Roger, Federal 3. We have the subject painted in. We are advising local. MAN ON PA: The founding fathers brought to fruition, the road to freedom through revolution because they exhausted all other means. Today, it is time to start a new kind of revolution. (CROWD CHEERING) It is now time for action. (SIRENS WAILING) (PANTING) (GRUNTS) Let me up! There's a bomb in the truck! Let me up! We got him. (GRUNTING) There's a bomb in there! Come on! (BEEPING) (TICKING) Let him go. He's the only one who can disarm this. Now! -MALE COP: Get back. -WOMAN: Check, please! Get back! Out, now! ANNOUNCER: All units, back off. We have confirmation of an explosive. Can you disarm this? I don't know. I've never seen anything quite like this before. What? I said I've never seen anything quite like this before. I heard what you said. You're supposed to be a demolitions expert! Well, I'm gonna to need to amend my resume then, because technology has definitely passed me by. Do something! Okay, you may want to hold on to something, in case this doesn't work. (BEEP) Ready? (POWERING DOWN) -(CHURCH BELL RINGING) -(TICKING STOPS) (EXCLAIMS) (LAUGHS JUBILANTLY) -Good choice, huh? -Yeah. Oh, man. I gotta go. I know. Thanks. (SIRENS WAILING DISTANTLY) (AIRPLANE WHOOSHING) That was a major setback. -How long to JFK? -(SIGHS) Oh, I don't know. Pilot, what's our ETA? Gentlemen. Della. You look surprised, Neil. What do you want, Dellacourt? He wants his revenge, Taylor. No, nothing so crude as revenge. No? What then? I want retribution. You stole my life, Neil. Oh, come on, Della. We can work together and make things better, like we always do. I don't think we ever made anything better. Maybe just different. You're a talented man, Mr. Dellacourt. Take his advice. No thank you, Mr. Taylor. But for old times' sake, Neil, I'll leave you with some advice of my own. Make a last wish. (MOUTHING) Hi, there. Where you going? Wilmington, Delaware. What in the world is in Wilmington, Delaware? You know, I don't know anymore. Pile in. I don't wanna keep a man from his destiny. Pile in. (MELLOW TUNE PLAYING ON PIANO) (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)
