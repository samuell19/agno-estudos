. [Thunder and rain] [Dramatic music] Again Switzerland's most successful publisher, Christian Haemmerli, has shocked the world. His upcoming article not only questions the authenticity of the Bible, but accuses the Church of hijacked religion to further its own agenda. Scientific reports from Basel University, in the Swiss magazine Fact's will have a huge impact on bilateral co-operations. [News in Finnish language] [News in Polish language] [News in French language] [News in Turkish language] [News in Spanish language] [News in Swedish language] No comment, I'm sorry. [indistinct chatter ] Sorry, I have nothing to say at this moment in time. Okay! Okay, I have one statement to make. Wanna know more? You can read it in Fact's. Thank you. Good bye. Sorry, no more. Thank you. [Indistinct chatter by the reporters] His allegations this time are also backed by the University of Basel. And should the be proven to be true as stated, this could certainly shake Christianity to its core. [Indistinct chatter in the background] Are we partying, Amigo? So what was that? Alright. You, are a bastard, Amigo. That was my story. Why would you sell it to Haemmerli? Just the rumors of your story triggered a state of emergency in the Vatican. Shit in the whole damn world. Good job my friend. This isn't just some little fraud. This is the biggest deception in humanity. Payback Time. huh? Business is good, is it? [Indistinct chatter by guests] [Indistinct chatter by the girls] [Car engine roar] [Dramatic music starts] [Car door closes] [Gunshot] [Gunshot] [Gunshot] [Child singing hymn] [string music go with child singing hymn] My whole life was about my faith. Everything was based on the Bible. Can you imagine what it feels like when someone like me suddenly realizes, the "Bible" is an invention? Religion is just a business. As a kid, I was supposed to have the gift of healing. When I was seven years old I had to touch these people, people that I didn't know. Old people. Sick people. Do you have any idea what that feels like? [Horsewhip sounds and hits] My whole life, I believed in, and prayed to, a made up God. [Fast piano music] Captain Jakobi: Okay. Let's go. Good Morning. All officers: Good Morning. District Attorney classifies this as a failed robbery. Yeah. at this guy's house, a thug gets in and pops around. I know, Martin. Half his head was blown off. It's an assassination. This isn't my first day. I've never seen anything like this. Have you? All officers: No. But the States Attorney leads the investigation. But why? Ever heard of "the right of first access"? Come on, the Police got the emergency call. May be so. My hands are tied. Make sure this does not leak. We don't want... You know that, he is the fucking press. Woman shouting: You fucking piece of fucking shit.. Wind blows, birds chirping Captain Sutter: What can I do for you, Mr. Tanner? I'm being threatened. I've been getting emails to my parish account for some time. And now, to my private account. Here, have a look at this. Is there something going at your parish, or perhaps something from your past? No, nothing I can think of. Have you tried to answering these emails? That can give you a clue of what this person wants? I don't negotiate with enemies of the Church, Inspector. And should I remind you, that blasphemy, is a criminal offense in this country! And freedom of religion, which includes freedom from religion is also a right in this country, Sir. I'll file the charges. But there is not much we can do at this point. Let me know if this person contacts you again. Thank you, Inspector. I hope you can find peace with the Lord. And I hope you can find peace on this earth. Sir! [Traffic noise] Well bless my heart. Where have you been the last few days? [Richard Graf sighs] Just having a quiet birthday celebration with a couple of friends. So why did you shut of your phone? So I wouldn't be interrupted by morons like you. Sit down. What's up with you. Redneck... Man... You really need help. What's wrong? "What's wrong?" Haemmerli is dead. Murdered! Oh my God... But, who? Who, who did that? Supposedly a robbery at his house. [Soft piano music playing] [Richard Graf] It's all your fault, this you know? [José Dantas] Richard, it's not my fault. Well who else's fault is it? You fucking sold it to him. I was just, I was just... proposing something. You where just being stupid. You where inveigled by a slimy fucker. But you know Haemmerli, you know know him I do, yes - but obviously you don't, Otherwise you wouldn't have given him the story! Have you thought of this as well. We lost our fucking publisher now. And that's your fault! It's not my fault... You fucked it all up. Okay. so what do you suggest now. What should we do? I don't know... Yeah, we should. I know, I tell you, we go on working. Richard, this is a huge thing. I know. We have to go on. We have to go on. [Parish] Hallelujah And the Lord said to me, be my shepherd. You are my flock. [Parish] Amen. Everything in the Bible, every word, describes our Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen. We here, gathered here today, are the only ones who will go and be one with our God. All of these people out there. All of them will burn in hell. But not us! [Parish] yeah! We are the chosen few. Say hallelujah! [Parish cheers] hallelujah Why do you copy the articles instead of just ripping them out? In case I need the original again. Oh, I thought you kept them for your private collection. [scoffs] Have a look at this. They might now something. Why do you think so? These three, have been a pain in the ass for powerful people for years. And on to something big. Think so? Have you looked in to anything that indicates a robbery? Nothing was stolen, his widow says. Have a look at their previous work. Who'd kill for their articles? What do you think? Shit. You know what happens if you piss off the wrong people... [Silent piano music] Chief: Stick to the Facts! Hallelujah. The Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord Jesus Christ is here with us. [Bordun singer in the background] [Speaking in tongues] Come to me. Yes! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Feel the Lord, feel him Yes, yes. The Lord Jesus Christ, the holy ghost in his heart. Do you feel the holy ghost in you. With you. Yes. do you feel the holy ghost? Have you seen this? Yes. I don't pay any attention to it. But it is stirring up a lot of the congregation. You better read it. This is terrible! Professor Becker: It is pretty spectacular... I've tested two grams of the parchment with radio carbon dating. It is between 1920 and 1950 years old. And you're absolutely sure about this? Prof. Becker: Absolutely! It completely covers your 12 Theses theory. How are we meant to present it. I've got a presentation... I've been working on it with my colleague, Professor Wagner. We know Jesus was a rabbi. And the parchment confirms, what was suspected, but not proven until now. Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene. Your first theses, the Holy Grail. It really is what you say. A wine cup. Nothing more... The only human DNA on this piece is from your finger prints. Jesus and Mary received the valuable gift from their friend, Joseph of Arimathea. And the greeting is amazing. Lilzahira, for the one who blossoms Listen... May goods light shine on you and your family on the twenty fifth anniversary, of the fruitful union of you and your beloved wife Mary. May these cups, given as a sign of my patronage, grant you happiness and prosperity, And may it illicit continued peace among you and your prodigious offspring. Your brother in the one true God, Joseph of Arimathea. So their marriage was fruitful. The Romans must have loved "I.N.R.I.". Igne Natura Renovatur Integra. Through fire nature will be renewed. And as your theses verifies; reincarnation. Jesus didn't die on the cross! He lived to at least to 56 years of age, which was a very advanced age at that time. For the first time, speculations made up on Jesus living beyond the cross, have factual evidence to support them. [Soft piano music] You have become a great leader for the Church. A good Shepherd. But a good Shepherd cares for all his sheep. Mrs. Tanner: Doesn't the Bible say; "the shepherd saves the lost sheep". The black sheep. That's why I ask, Rainer, are you a good shepherd? Mrs. Tanner: Are you? [Richard Graf's voice] "What if this was Jesus as a child?" "And we were undeniably to blame!" "What if our white Gods are nothing but blood sucking figure heads?" "What would you do if everything was different than you thought it was?" "Who could make right to this ancient and ongoing lie?" "Who could settle the debt to the poorest of our world?" Mrs. Tanner: Have you counted your sheep? Today, one of your sheep comes home to you, to bring you loneliness, and desperation. Today, I bring you fear. Are you ready, good shepherd? I didn't want to show you this, but here "The 12 Theses in the era of Aquarius"? What insane person would do this? Isn't there anything you can do? I've informed the Bishop of Bern. After all our parish has done for the Church, Rome will be involved. [Birds chirping through the city noise] Ah fuck off. Calm down, Richard! That is so fucking helpful. You should put that in a book of "How to be helpful". Are you fucking mental? Any idea what's happening here? This is gonna... Dantas: Do you know what?! Of course I do... You, you need to calm down, relax! I've got some work to do here! [snorting ecstasy] [Jacob Tanner] Then Jesus said, “You didn't feed me when I was hungry", "You didn't invite me in", "You didn't look after me when I was sick...” The people said; “When do we ever see you hungry or thirsty or any of these things?” And Jesus answered; “I tell you, whatever you do for one of the least of these people, you do for me.” I don't think that we're aware of others around us... Others in need. Do we really look at and listen to the people in our everyday lives? The homeless man in the street that we see every day, or the single mother we know, who is struggling to survive? Our mothers, and fathers, and families? But I tell you, Mankind, is our family. Jesus said; “Whatever you do for the least of these people, you do for me”. So, what will you do? What will you do? Amen [Parish] Amen Elisabeth Tanner: I'm so proud of you Jacob, you really did a good job. Thanks Mom. You were awesome! Why didn't you do like I told you? Honey, please. It was his first service. We don't need any weak Christians. The parish needs a strong hand to keep it in line. I can't preach the way you do dad. You talk as if you know everything Jesus thought. But all we really know a bunch of stories We don't know who he actually was, right? I beg you pardon?! What is this heresy? That's exactly what I'm talking about. You can shape your life on the teachings of the Bible, but you can't take it word for word. I won't listen to anymore of this! The Bible tells us loud and clear how Jesus lived, thought and acted. His life, his ministry, is describe word for word. You are not entitled to qualify the Bible. Do you hear me! [sad piano music] [squeaking old door opens and closes] [Tired steps echo in the old stone stairs] [punch sound] [children singing hymn like theme] [Hearing his Chief's words in his head] "You're a smart man, stick to the "Fact's'". Hey boss. Three guns. Fuck... Chief, I've got to ask, I need four subpoenas, Graf, Dantas, Becker and Wagner Why? The professors wont talk to the Police and the journalists weren't traceable. Since when don't you find someone? You're a God damn hound-dog. I've been busy, you know? Sorry, too early. Use that good nose of yours. You know it can be pretty dangerous publishing articles like this Are you threatening me? Jakobi, Capo Basel. How did you know were I was? Why haven't you been returned my calls? Haven't got any calls. I didn't wanna have to subpoena you. Look, I know you guys are on to something really big. I need you to talk to me, so I can protect you. [scoffs] Really? Due to our close relationship with the Swiss legal authorities? Feel free to contact me if, you want to save your ass. I will, thanks. I suppose you've got a card, have you? Yeah, it's me. I just had some Jakobi from the Police. No. I didn't say you went to the police, did I? What I'm saying is, we need to speed this up, cause these fuckers are on to us. [Birds chirping in the wind] You... You are my son! You study Christian Theology, you're going to be a preacher! That's not gonna happen. This is all bullshit! We'll talk about this later, Jakob. This, this devil has got to be stopped. There is no devil! The Bible is just a bunch of lies! [Hissing] How dare you talk like that, in front of me and your God?! That's exactly what I'm talking about. You put yourself before God, and you don't even realize it. What?! And by the way, I met with him. You... you met with this monster behind my back? Yes, and he knows you all too well. Pack your things. You're going to live in the Deacon's house. And I'll be praying for your soul. Praying for me!? [scoffs] Is that all your love is worth? Your love and Christian compassion, as long as I don't have another opinion? I don't need you, or your God. You both make me sick! [metronome ticking in the background] This devil has convinced my own son to betray his own God. Have a look at this! Have a seat please. The 12 Theses in the Era of Aquarius Number one, The holy Grail of Valencia is a wine cup given to the Rabbi by his friend Joseph of Arimathea. Number two, the content and purpose of the cup was changed at the fourth Lateran council in 1213 from wine to blood to fit the myth of the crucifixion Was that really changed by the council? Of course not! "The reckless feudal hierarchy of the church is not justified, because, the content of the Holy Grail was always wine, and never blood" The fourth Theses accuses the Church of abusing love for power. Nothing new there... All is God, God is in all. Sounds pretty good. Then you'd equating God with a murderer. Or a pedophile!? "God is in all... Look, the bottom line is, this is just as valid as any other beliefs. I seriously doubt that your perpetrator is any real threat. Threat? Inspector. This man has destroyed my family. My own son has lost all his beliefs in God. It's all a matter of personal belief, Sir. For this perpetrator, as well as your son. [scoffs] I wont have a son who is a non-believer. Please let us know if there are any serious threats, Pastor. Have a nice day. [Tanners indistinctly prays] [Indistinc chatter in the hallway] [Mrs Tanner is crying silently] I Love you, bro. This is all bullshit. I'll be at the deacons house, just till I find somewhere else. You take care of her. We'll stay in touch, won't we? Yeah of course [phone rings] Familia Dantas, Hola Hello is that Rita? Hi, It's Richard, Is José there, please. His phone is off. No, no, no. I talked to him about an hour ago so I guess he should be back any time. Okay. could you ask him to ring me as soon as you see him. I think the office has been broken in to. Did they steal anything? Can't tell. It's like chaos here at the best of time. I think he might be able to tell better than me. "Joder"! I knew that story would cause trouble. [knocking] Ah, está José - Hold on please. [threatening music] Good Evening. How are you this fine evening? We are raising money for the poor, and I am asking for a small gift. Si, si - claro. I, I'm sorry. I was expecting my husband, so, one moment. [Mrs. Dantas gasps for air] Hello. Rita? Hello Rita? [glass breaking in the distant] [Graf choking] [Temple gong sounds] [dramatic orchestra music] [Anchorman Shea] Hikers made a terrible discovery this morning. Close to the Scheltenpass in Canton Bern nine bodies were found. They were all arranged around a burning cross, which strengthens the theory that these people all belonged to an unknown suicidal cult. Shit! Jakobi: I fucking told them Anchorman: Bern Chief Police Commander Renzo, made a unusual decision by assigning Captain Christine Sutter to run this the Task Force. She is a known professional on white color crime however she may have a little trouble dealing with this assignment Mr. Blatter. Good morning and welcome to the studio. Thank you, Jeff - Good morning. So could you perhaps give us any information why chief Renzo would assign someone to run this case who isn't a homicide detective Well Jeff, all I can tell you for the moment is, that Captain Sutter knew one of victims who was involved in another case. I knew two of these Journalists before they were killed. Would it entitle me to run this investigation? Well of course not! But this is obviously a tragic case of mass suicide. There you have it, Ladies and Gentlemen. This is Switzerland for you. The Swiss Police is as efficient as their Swiss watches. Less than two hours after this news went public, and without conferring with the CSI Team, Mr. Blatter has taken the liberty to announce this as a closed case. I'm Jeff Shea, and you're watching Switzerland Today [music gets more intense] Okay. So, I see you at 4.00 Okay. Thanks Dr. Becker's secretary. Why bother. Those idiots wanted to get closer to God and they got it. Well I don't know. I think there is more to it than that. Well sometimes... it's not up to us. What do you mean? What do you mean?! What have these dead to do with your case? These five are connected to Haemmerli and the article on Jesus But the missing link here is the Tanner Family. This isn't a cult. This is a mass murder. That's my man. Good work. Thanks to your leader-shit. Hi. I'm Captain Sutter. We spoke on the phone. Of course. I haven't touched anything in there since this all happened. I try not to even go in there. It's hard enough being here. It has just been so hard for everyone. [scoffs] That's really, really well hidden Mister Dantas! [Tearing sound] [clicking sound] [Cupboard door opens] Fuck... In the legend interpretation must this wine during the Eucharist become the blood of God. [Steps in the hallway] Yes. This is Captain Sutter. I'm at Claragraben 8. I need you to send back up. There has been a break in and I think they're still here. Thanks. Jakobi. Capo Basel. Basel CSI is on their way. Or do you want me to call them off? This is an important piece of the puzzle. At the council of Troyes, Bernard of Clairevaux asserted that killing God's enemies, is not only permitted, but glorified. With that Statement he created the outline for 'Christian assassins', which later became the Knights Templar. Who had the Holy Grail as their symbol... The beginning of the myth. Turning from 'love thy neighbor' to. 'killing in the name of God'. It's about justifying the crusades. But look at this, Church and state were one, until Napoleon change it from, "God and King is one" to... "the People and King is one". [Scoffs] Guess that part got lost. This is overwhelming. This is actually what we were looking for the whole time. The Chief also confirmed that a dubious parchment, connected to one of the dead men, has been turned over to experts of the Vatican for further examination. [Music playing] I have to show you something. Wait a second [Piano music] [music intensifies] So, see you tomorrow. my place? Sure! Something nineish? Yeah that's fine. Yeah? Yeah! What are you up to know? Well, I'm heading home. Doing some more research, it's getting quite exiting. Isn't it... Well... See you tomorrow! Good night! Good night... Hi Jakobi, Capo Basel. I'm so sorry for your loss. I can't actually believe my luck. And where were you? I was at the Deacon's house, I was kicked out by my father. I had to go through hours of "healing conversion"... Your father received emails before he died from another victim, Richard Graf. I know, I read them all. So how was Graf connected with your father? When Graf was young, my father was his tutor in a Christian commune. I wanted to meet Graf so I could find out more. When was that? About two weeks before they died. [Speaking french] Bonjour, Jakobi Cantonal Police Basel I need you to care for a crown witness, Jakob Tanner. Thank you. Your life is in danger. A friend, Sergent Dubois, from Interpol in Lyon. He'll pick you up today. He'll be responsible for your safety till this is over. I stole this for you, Sis. You're mad. The greeting is amazing. 'Lilzahira'. For the one who blossoms. Chief! Jakobi. I can see that... Can you get me access to the Bern-Files on Scheltenpass? No! They are complaining already. This isn't a cult, this is a mass murder! Be aware of the jurisdiction! I am, Sir... Good! Now see you back at the office! At the earthquake around Alpuente, 600 years ago, The box with the grail and the parchment was damaged. The main part of the grail was separated from this shard and the parchment. So...? The Church replaced the missing part? Right. Pretty smart... The castle was considered safe back then, therefor there's no miracle that Graf found the parchment there too. I would guess, there might be even more secrets in that ruin. [Jakobi remembering conversations] "Then I suggestion you use the Secom" "Not regular phone lines" "Less than two hours..." "and without conferring with the CSI Team" "Mr. Blatter has taken the liberty..." "since when don't you find someone you're looking for "Bern Police Chief Renzo..." "Be aware of the jurisdiction" "have you heard of something called 'freedom of the press'" "freedom of the press is just a theoretical shield at the moment" Hi. Do you know me? Jakobi. Capo Basel. I'm trying to get access to the Scheltenpass files for days now. Why am I being ignored? Hold on, young man! This is a big case. Ran by the Capitol Police! It is nothing for you boys in Basel. I don't intend to take it over. I need to see what connections some of the dead have with my victim, Haemmerli There are no connections. Haemmerli had more enemies than the State of Israel Well let me decide that! I'm in charge of this investigation You are in charge of nothing. What are you hiding? That's all, young man. What was your name again? You want my name? It's "go fuck your self", you jumped up prick. Wait here! I've got something sweet for you, Captain! I hope you are the right person to have it. Everything is still there. Every dirty, little secret. Are you sure I can keep it? Of course! But if you can't use it against them, make sure the press get it. I really appreciate this. Thank you! Jakobi... I hope you nail these suckers! I am trying. Thank you. I know... [Slow music] Wow. What happened to your table? What do you think? Shit. We had visitors from Bern today... Anything missing? Well I don't yet. I mean It looks like nothing is missing, but... Where is the stuff now? [Grunts] If I tell you that I'd have to marry or kill you. What a choice. How did you get it? Mrs Haemmerli gave it to me. But all of Haemmerli's computers were confiscated She was away at the time of the raids. Haemmerli used her computer as a private back up. We shouldn't have this. The supreme court ruled it'd be deleted. Well I wont do that, and you haven't seen it! Take the rest of the day off. and watch the news. Renzo. Wanna tell me what's going on here? Calm down, Captain. this wasn't my idea. The order came from the top. I thought you were the top. The parchment belongs to the Church. It's going back to its rightful owner. Graf found the Parchment, it doesn't belong to the church! The case is closed, Captain. This case is far from closed. You've got enough lose ends to strangle half Switzerland That's enough. The fact is, Sutter, your job is done here. [Radio announcer]Cantonal Police announced today, the killing of publisher Haemmerli was a failed robbery. The case's now been closed, since the perpetrator most likely disappeared over the Swiss border You're right. I'm done. But you can't just quit like this, you have to give notice. This is my notice. But you have to train your replacement. No, I'm done! If you quit like this, there is no unemployment pay, no pension! Unlike you, and everybody else here, I'm not willing to sell my self to the highest bidder. Bern Police Chief Renzo has also confirmed that the case concerning the Scheltenpass is closed too. And - most interesting, not only were three very prominent Swiss journalists murdered But nothing has been made public about the case, and everything is now classified as a national security issue. I'm Jeff Shea, and you're watching Switzerland Today. May God save us from what's in store tomorrow. [Sad music playing] Bad day? Tell me about it. They just pulled the plug. Isn't there anything you can do? Not really. So you, give up? I seriously don't know. I'm an official, not a P.I. You know, rules... On the house - my last day. So why are you quitting? Collage is getting more intense, I've sold the place Say what's your major again? Theology and Graphics design. Ey, what? Well, that's a combination. Interesting. But it's no money maker So, what's next? Regular policing stuff. Cheers! Cheers! [Streetcar squeak] [Music plays] The 12 theses in the era of Aquarius. Love is abused for power, by and for the church. It needs neither victims nor crucifixion, nor forgiveness. Without God's claim there is no great commission. The cup of the holy grail is compared with the Celtic Dysgl, the Druidic cauldron to brew the potions, it symbolizes with this comparison the syncretism of the Christian religion, whose stated goal is world domination. The solar centralist display of power in Europe began in Egypt with the local priesthood, the book of the Dead and the Belief in the last Judgment. She continued in Babylon with the Babylonian Talmud, the monotheism and the ritual rape of the brides of God and intermingled in Persia with the declared world struggle of good against evil. The whole was adopted by the decaying Roman Empire. The Divine Trinity played a major role, but was in turn copied from the Vedic conventions. The Babylonian Zodiac with eternal growth and decay of 24.000 years lasting Zodiac Cycle hat to yield to the linear time of the Roman Christians. [Child singing hymn] The Persian Mazdaismus is the true template for Christianity. The alleged blood of God of the grail is clear in human nature and a construct of the hegemony addiction in Europe. That's why all churches and denominations must follow the four articles of Prague. From the time of the Reformation wars and in the context of the Sermon of the Mount, renouncing money, trade and institutional links and renouncing ownership in general. Everything is God, God is everything. The Gnostic dualism of Hermes Trismegistos sees laws of nature and eternity question without human judgment and without institutional condemnation. In other words, there is no good or evil. No reward or punishment. That makes each church and every ecclesial institution unnecessary. Every thing is god, god is everything. [Solar Templar Prayer] "Sometimes I wish it to end, but I fear the end". "Sometimes for eternity I yearn, but in me desires still burn". "On-wards, on-wards to the stars, On-wards, on-wards to the source". "Other gods other realms, fear of falling overwhelms". [Soft orchestral music] [Children praying "Our Father" in Latin Language] [Hesitant knocking] Sit down. Mon signore, please, what's wrong? My son, I pray every day for wisdom, but still the Lord can not always be understood. Terrible forces threaten the holy foundation of our Church. Evil! Has come to life again. Time has come, Brother. [Whispering] Time has come. I have prayed, cried, fasted, but in vain. The will of our Lord demands our utmost. The mandate has been given. But why? No one got away. A courier brought it from Rome last night. When must I set out? We all wish you to leave immediately. [abbot mumbles indistinctly a prayer] [Abbot] "There is hope that you can choke this fire before it breaks out" "You travel as a new Knights Templar". "May God's power and wisdom be with you" "God's angels guard and keep you till earth's days are past" "In times of pain and fear," "God's angels guard you," "and keep you safe!" [Blast and Thunder sounds] [Stormy Music plays] Oh. Thank you Sure! How long are you gonna be gone? Two Days. Okay. [pick-lock clicks] Darling. You have the run of the house. so, nail him. Come on, I don't even know if he's interested. Find out. Cake and wine are in the fridge. Yeah. We'll do some publicity work tonight and maybe there is wine after... Oh and by the way. We'll record Graf's Theses and post it tonight. Oh wow. Are you sure? [Sighs] Yeah! [Traffic noise] [Door opens and closes] [Tom mumbles indistinctly] [Tom grunts] [knocking on the door] [Neighbor] What the fuck's going on down there? Tom? [Ambulance siren sounds] Like I said, actually It's embarrassing, I... I lost my balance, I grabbed a table, it fell on me... End of the story. According to your doctors, your injuries indicate otherwise. Have you been in a fight, sir? I'm not feeling that well. Can you please get me a nurse? I'll get back to you. Anna... Tom! What is going on? Someone tried to kill me. What? It's a fact. But why the story about the table then? I don't know who to trust anymore. Do you? No? So let's get the fuck out of here. Wait! What are you doing? I leave! Mr. Stein! Who are you? What do you want? My name is Tom Keller, and this is my friend Anna Molari. We need your help. You don't need my help, you need a doctor. Mr. Stein. We've got your address from Christine Sutter. Don't you know her? She was the chief inspector of Bern who led the task force on the Scheltenpass. I've already told her, I want nothing to do with that. Why not? [Amon Stein scoffs] Can you wait a second? Ferdinand. Here is Amon. We have company, can you join us? Ja. Okay. Alright. See you. He is coming? Go make yourself comfortable. Hello Christine? Hi - it's Anna Molari. Yeah. I just wanted to keep you updated. Tom got beaten up pretty badly last night. [Car engine starts] What is the Church searching for right now? They already have got the parchment. The are searching for the Holy Speer. The Lance of Longinus. The Lance? Yeah. The cup and spear belong together. The story tells us, the spear was used to stab Jesus in the side, and the cup to collect his blood. Exactly. The legends says the Grail can give you eternal life, and the Lance would make you invincible. So if you have both items, you rule the world. Why aren't they just going to Vienna and take it? It is widely known to be a copy. Where is the original? Oh, that is your problem, in the truest sense of the word... It seams to me that someone might think that you already know where the original is... A few seconds ago, I believed the original is in Vienna. Belief and faith is not knowledge. Nobody messes with the Christians without paying for it. It's about power. Political and financial Power It is all humbug - a made up history. [Message tone] [Tom Keller] "Number 12" 'All is God, God is all', portrays fulfillment as the whole, not as a war between the forces of good and evil. There is no good and evil, no reward and no punishment. Everything is God, God is in everything. The church deemed it necessary to remove this this simple article of faith by council decree. Anyone found preaching on this article was threatened by penalty of death. [Slow piano music] Alright. Social media of the world here we come! But don't post it yet, okay? Of course not. Dweeb... [chuckles] What? Wanna hang out with me? Cake and red wine? On the couch. [Dramatic music] [Upbeat music] The entrance wound is here. It was inserted with great force into the young man's abdomen, and then in to the woman's thorax. [Music gets dramatic] It's not so creepy as it looks. These are only fresh water filters. I'm a reservist. If we are attacked I grant Basel fresh water supply with ten other men. But in peacetime only I have access. I had to move my situation room down here since my investigations were being sabotaged. When your sister died, I set her case up here straight away. [Child singing hymn like theme] [Latin language] Pater Noster qui es in caelis, sanctificetur nomen tuum. Quiet! Be quiet! You have to listen - Understand? I will ask, you will answer. If you scream, I will hurt you. A man and two students came to you yesterday. I want to know why. A friend... a historian, retired.. He came to me... And the students? Asking bout the dead - from back then. What dead? WHAT DEAD?! The cult from Scheltenpass. You know what you photographed? Fill me in. As one of Professor Wagner's students, I've got access to all files. They had substantial evidence. Graf proved in his theses the complex story building by the Church around the myth of the Holy Grail. This picture. We know it. It's the Grail... But it is an inevitable that it was one Grail and that Jesus' blood was picked up with it. There were two! Cups. Wine cups. As the research of Graf and Becker proves; The Holy Grail was nothing but a wine cup. I told them nothing, I only talked about the Lance. What Lance? The Lance of Longinus, in Spain. [Loud cracking sound] Joseph of Arimathea gave Jesus and Mary two cups. We know that! Back then, a woman was a man's possession, valued about the same as a piece of furniture. Jesus changed that in his teachings, portraying femininity as something honorable. Women give birth, they symbolize life. To mark that in his gift, Joseph of Arimathea gave and Mary a broad and Jesus a narrow one. Eventually, women started challenging the male hierarchy and the church had to squash them. They forced women back in to their place, and they created the myth of the Holy Grail. The second cup... [Scoffs] Yes. We know from Dr. Becker's office, Graf found the shard of agate with the parchment. That piece was missing and the church replaced it. I mean it is in the catacombs of the University of Basel now. I think I know who's behind all of this... Come on. I need to introduce you to someone. Join me. Hey. Thanks for showing up. After all you've done... And it's nice to breath the Swiss air again. Guess we're the only ones living after reading the 12 Theses. C'mon. All of it has been said before. What's the big deal of the whole thing. It's the historical connection. Business, family wealth and nations are all built on the history of the Bible. If it's faked... It would make faith independent from the Church. That's the good part. And the claims of compensation the bad? The amount of the claims wouldn't even be manageable. So it's all about money, when it comes down it? Faith is a beautiful thing, and it doesn't need an organization. Believers share love - not hate. The religious organizations stir disgust towards everyone outside their own, in order to stay strong as a group. Do you see what I'm saying? I mean have you ever had a problem with someone because they were Jewish or Muslim? Of course not. Don't even know anybody who have. To me Pentecostal church just numbs everything in life worth living for. But the Bible is not infallible, and you don't need the church to access God. You know what my one regret is? That I never got the chance to sit down with my father, man to man over a beer and just talk. Instead of all this nonsense about shepherd and sheep. [water dropping] I found this in your apartment. I've never seen it before. I have. A long time ago. I grew up in a monastery in Italy. This was the symbol of the Order. The monastery was officially closed in the early 90.s and I was transferred to a catholic boarding school in Switzerland. Looks like the Monastery and the Order has come to life again. What? A secret monastery that sends out hit men? I don't even think the Vatican knows about it. The monastery sort of trains young talents? We were drilled to obey, and the only law existing to us was the words of our abbot. It's not so long ago. And plausible. But I think I know where to look for what they're searching for. I need to finish Anna's work. I'll go to Spain, Alpuente. What's there? The Lance. I know where to look for it. Anna and Tom got permission to excavate - and I will not let these fuckers win [Owl howl. Church bell ringing] A thousand pardons, your eminence. But What, what can they do? We, have the parchment! The parchment, the Grail and the Lance, belong in the hands of the church. You will go to Spain for the Lance. [Fast piano music] [Motorbike roaring] Excuse me, can you tell me where I can find the mayor? You are looking at her, so Loretta Perez I am sorry. Don't worry. It's a small town and somebody's got to do the dirty work. Let's go to my office. [Speaking Spanish] [Birds chirping in the wind] Thanks for approving our work. I was expecting two students? I have to finish this on my own. And may I ask, why? My sister Anna and her fellow student Tom are dead. Murdered! Murdered? [Steps coming closer] They uncovered to much in their research and were looking forward to completing it here. Then they were attacked. But what's does that have to do with Alpuente? The ruin was an important hide out centuries ago. Yes, I know, I'm a historian. A few years ago, a Swiss journalist found a parchment here. His research led to a scandalous article, and everyone connected to the evidence died mysteriously. I believe there are more secrets to be found here. It's funny, all of a sudden everyone's interested in our relics. How do you mean? About an hour ago a scientist from Rome was here, asking about relics from the ruins. Do you know what he was looking for? He asked about the Mother of Consolation, a statue. I know, but it's in Corcolilla. You've done your home work well. Of course I know the Mother of Consolation. You swap with Corcolilla every 3 years for a period of 3 months as a sign of brotherhood. [Steps getting even closer] [Gong sounds] But she's found already, so, whats new about her. Since ancient times, it's been a practical way to hide important things in other objects. But she's just that big or so, I mean, what could fit inside her? Who knows what the religious people think... Maybe Jesus is still in her tummy. [chuckles] You told the Italian that? No! I told him nothing. He's a greasy guy in a non fitting suit, carrying religious symbols, not really the man I like. I just sent him to the priest! Before I start in the ruin, I'd like to go to Corcolilla. I'll show you how to get there. And when you get back - let us have dinner and talk bout your work. It's very interesting. [Fast dramatic music] So all this excitement because of you... [Remembering Mayor Perez] "he's a greasy guy in a non fitting suit." [Wood burst - metal jingle] This is a breaking news story A fanatic christian order has been uncovered by the Police. The Order acted in a hidden monastery in the alps in northern Italy. The Monastery was previously used as a catholic orphanage Captain Martin Jakobi of Cantonal Police Basel was once one of the children freed. Captain Jakobi unveiled the Monastery yesterday after finding connections to murder cases in Switzerland he was investigating. There are no comments on this story from Swiss Police or the Catholic Church. Italian police however confirm that the children safe and in hospital care. Interpol who coordinated the rescue with Captain Jakobi will be holding a press conference later today. And now to the scandal at Swiss Channel One News. Jeff Shea quits after being heavily harassed by the national police spokes man. You can't say that! I can say it. And it's true. What song and dance is this? This is the song and dance You cannot say that! Don't bullshit me... You're in trouble Oh, yeah - how am I in trouble with? With the police. With the police? Get your finger out of my face! Shea is reported to be leaving for a job in the United States. [Indistinct dialog] The Lance... [Jakobi laughs out loud] Jakobi: Holy fucking Moses. Jakobi: Do you know what day it is today? Claire: No... Jakobi: Rainer Tanner's Birthday. Claire: Are you saying what I think you're saying? Do you think he's here? I'm positive. And if not, I really need a drink myself. Remember, you told me you had a wish? Which one? [six-pack jangle] Cheers dad!
