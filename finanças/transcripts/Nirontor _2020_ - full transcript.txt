Smoking is injurious to health. It causes cancer. Smoking is injurious to health. It causes cancer. Yes. Are you listening? Yes, I can hear you. Is it better now? What about the new maid? She is still on leaves? No. It's been 4 days. Yes. Mr Sen, it's ready. - Wait a minute. Listen. I have to go. Take care. I am going to climb up. The network might not be there. I will try to call you. Okay, bye. Sir, your company has forcefully taken this plot. Honestly speaking, it's not possible to work on this plot. The land we saw on the way is good. Why are we climbing up unnecessarily? It's exotic. Haven't you seen the word in the advertisements for hotel and tourism? That's our goal. Sir, this place is developing. There will be a traffic jam here. You wouldn't care about the exotic place any more. What's stopping you? Why are you fixated on this plot? You get a lot of brokerages. Hotel on such a huge plot? Sir, have you seen anything else apart from homestays here? Would the localites create a problem? - Please stop. I am talking to him. Look, we are creating employment opportunities. There will be local employment when the construction of the hotel begins. What do you think? That no one tried to work on this plot? I know it. I have heard about it but I have never fooled local people. I will be under a lot of pressure. Okay. You may go ahead with it. Thank you. But I will show you another plot day after tomorrow. I will see it for my knowledge if you insist. We will proceed with the work considering this plot. Okay. I will take your leave. Bye. Bye. What? Do you want to smoke? No. You are smoking at this altitude. There are no houses or people here. And I should build a hotel here. There is no network here. Yes, that's right. There's no network here. Shit. Hey. - Sir. Two bottles of mineral water. And a little hot water. Okay. Get me two glasses. - Anything else? Mr Sen. Don't you want some food? Are chips available? - Yes. Get me some. - Okay. What's for dinner? There is vegetarian food tonight. Pulses, bread and vegetables. Ben, get the luggage sent here. Okay. Ben. - Sir. Is egg available? Yes. Get two omelettes for dinner. Okay? Two? - Yes. Anything else? (Local language) Now? I will have to check. I will go and check. Send what's asked for. Let's go. The leftover from yesterday is not finished yet. Why did you ask for more? (Local language) I restarted it many times. There is no network here. Didn't you know that there is no network here? I knew it. That's why I changed the sim card. I was using the cook's mobile for so long. There is nothing here. Yes. So many facilities. Why didn't you check earlier? Would you blame me now? It's good you came. You don't do anything. You are just sitting and doing all that. What? The same. Love and all. Okay. What problem do you have with me? I have been noticing. I haven't worked with you earlier. Why do you assume that I am a wasteful resource? You spoke to your family this morning. It became a problem when I want to do the same. Do you want to drink? No. Why do you ask me the same thing every day? (Local language) (Local language) (Local language) (Local language) Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Can I have a cup of tea? - Yes, sir. Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Aren't you ready yet? Don't you want to go to the site? No, there is nothing to see. The plots here are useless. Have a seat. - Yes. I am in a vacation mood today. Okay. Seems like you had a party last night. Party? With him? Where is Mr Bhaskar? Is he sleeping? No, he went for a walk in the morning. It's quite late. - Okay. Is Michael your real name? Lal Babu Pandit. Are you not Christian? - No, sir. I am from Bihar. Most people here are Buddhist. We don't stay here. We live down the hill. I thought so. Sir, my grandfather came here many years back. He worked at a garment shop. Later, my father came here. He bought the shop. But I didn't like the work. I like driving. So, I bought a car. The syndicate's drivers used to call me Micheal. From Michael Schumacher. Oh, like that. Michael, is there a market around? - Yes. I want to shop. There is one but it's away from here. If you are ready, then let's go. Did you go to the market? No, there is no market here. I got it from here. Where are you going? I am going to get some wood. Are you kidding with me? You shouldn't go around like that. Are you on holiday? - Okay, sir. (Local language) What is this? - Okay. You have vegetables, right? Do you have a lemon? Yes. - Okay. What was in the packet? A pig. Didn't you hear it? I know what pork is. With whose permission did you get it? That's strange, Mr Sen. Do I need permission for that? Are we on a school tour? No. We are on an office tour. And you work under me. You can't bring pork here just because I don't say anything. Do you even know if it's allowed in their house? Let me say something. We should have a mutual understanding if we have to work and stay together. Understood? Get that straight into your head. It's neither fish nor egg. Even you drink at night. Did you ever ask me if I am comfortable with it? Why did you have a fight because of meat? What can I say? I am going to have it, not him. - Are you saying something? Yes. We are at a higher altitude. Yes, we have come down as we don't have as much work today. It's really cold here. I have a peculiar boy with me. He is driving me crazy as there is no network. Yes. Okay. Listen. Did she get up? Huh? Wake her up after some time. Otherwise, she won't eat. Okay. Oh God. I haven't paid the maid. Don't pay her. I would return and pay her. I will call you back. Bye. How much? - Rs 20. Don't you have to make a call? Go ahead. No. I have network. I forgot to get my mobile. Gopal had called. What did he say? We can't have that plot. He won't take any responsibility for the plot. What does he mean? Ask him to come. We have to talk to him. That's not possible. He has gone to the town for some urgent work. He would return the day after tomorrow. Bloody hell. Let's go. Would you like to have some momos? Not now. Let's go. Sir. (Local language) That's a great gift. Thank you. Oh. You know the local tongue. Somewhat. I can't speak but I can understand. Still. Sir, shall I leave? Come at 8 in the morning tomorrow. Okay. Did you have dinner? I will in some time. My friends are here. We will chat for a while. Is there a bar nearby? Yes. Can I go there and buy it? You can even drink there. No. No. Don't act. Do you want to come? Yes. No. I have network now. Yes. Who is it? - Carry on. I will follow you. Hello. Yes. Okay. Listen to me. Honestly... Hello. (Local language) Do you want another one? A small one. Sir, tell me when to stop. That's enough. You too have some. - Thank you. Thank you. Mr Bhaskar is here. Please come and have a seat. Sir. Are you leaving? - Yes. Okay, good night. - Good night. Good night, sir. Excuse me. Yes. Yes, sir. Do you have pork momos? - Yes. Get me one plate of chicken and pork momos each. Okay. What happened? Cheers. Cheers. You get stressed a lot. You get tense. Don't do that. Did I say anything to you? What would you say? I know you had a fight with her. Say something else, please. Break-up. Why are you trying to be a detective? Have your drink. - What can I do? I hail from a lawyer's family. That's my habit. Why did you fight? I can't tell you. I didn't do anything. This is the first time I came so far on a tour. That's why it's creating troubles. That happens. That's why. - That's obvious. Why would it happen though? Give it some time. You are still young. What would you do at my age? Which one is the pork momo? - This one. Here you go. I won't drink more. It creates a little problem in the beginning. Then you will get used to it. Get married and everything will be fine. This is not your personal problem. Your generation is suffering from this. Communication. Exactly. Everything is fine till I am physical present there. There are no fights. If I am away, it's a problem. Rascal. All of you stay in touch. But communication is the problem. All of you are always connected. Via mobile, messages, Facebook on the internet. You don't understand the pain of not being able to be in touch. That's why you all don't respect it. Don't take it the technology for granted and respect it. You had a fight with your girlfriend and drinking with a man of your dad's age. You should talk to her nicely being able to talk to her at a place where there is no network. You should talk to her lovingly. But you fought with her instead. You know that you would just apologise in some time. That's it. It could have not been so simple. What if it wasn't? It's raining in the city. Would you let me make a call? (Local language) (Local language) (Local language) (Local language) (Local language) (Local language) (Local language) (Local language) Is it ringing? The person you are trying to call is not answering. Please try after some time. (Local song) (Local song) (Local song) (Local song) (Local song) (Local song) (Local song) Do you know this song? It's in the local language. (Local language) (Local language) (Local language) (Local language) No, sir. I was just joking. I don't know it so well. I only know the song. It's by Bipul Chettri, right? Yes. - I know the lyrics. Like that. I thought something else. That you must be hiding something. You almost impressed me. (Local song) (Local song) (Local song) Mr Bhaskar. Who do you have in your family? Father, mother. Okay. No. You have it. I have a son and a wife. And a daughter. Okay. Sir, my daughter is an air hostess. She doesn't stay with us. She is settled in the city. Is she married? Not yet. We are looking for an educated and nice suitor from a decent family. What do you call it? My daughter is self-made. We could never imagine someone from our family do so well. Especially a girl. That's it. Have tea. I will be right back. What do you understand? - You are thinking too much. Air hostess. Should I talk about you? Pack your bags after reaching the hotel. We will leave tomorrow morning. Where to? Home. We are going to a new place today. What about the rest of the plots to be shown by Gopal? Leave it. Enough of looking for a plot in a remote place. Let's go home. Sir, you won't have any problem, right? There are rooms available in the hotel. If you don't have a problem, then I don't either. I would drink and go to sleep. Sir, do you want to use the bathroom right now? No. - Then I would. I have indigestion. Go ahead. Oh my God. So many medicines. No. My health is not great. That's why I keep it. If I go out with you again, I will have to carry medicines. Why are you on the phone again? Take the medicine. No. I was checking if the network is here. I am feeling how I felt on the first day. There should be network today. Damn it. Why are you panicking? It's just one night. Why do you get upset? I am not upset. I just said it. What is your problem? Not a problem. I am feeling weird. How are you feeling physically? I don't know. My heart feels weird. It will be fine. - Have a drink with me. You will be fine. Mr Sen, you drink every day. It's not good for your health. What do you mean? If you ask me. I don't drink with everybody every day. I am drinking today. You don't drink with me. But you drink a lot. Who told you that? - I can't say that. Cheers. - Cheers. I left her alone. She is really worried. She has anxiety. You get anxious, not her. That's not the case, sir. Get married. Stay with her. Everything will be fine. I did. I decided we can't stay apart two years back. I brought her to Kolkata. I married her at Dakshineshwar temple. My family members aren't bad people. They are pretty good. But Typical North Kolkata family. We have a press at home. The neighbours call it a press. The same that happens. Too many people. The more the people, the more the gossip. You know what? She doesn't know the city. She is not from Kolkata. My family won't help her. She is very lonely. When my job gets permanent... No. I won't wait that long. I would take her home when I return from here. She won't stay there but my family should know. What? They are elders but they don't realise that it's not good for anybody. No one is happy. We are all struggling every day. I am the only son. Still. Actually, I am under a lot of stress these days. I will tell you. Come in. Dinner served. Thank you. - Okay. Keep it there. Do you want to eat? No. I don't feel like. I won't eat tonight. You were saying something. Forget about me. I keep talking. You became silent. Tell me about your family. I don't know about your wife or children. There is my wife, our maid who has been with us for a long time and me in our family. Child? We don't have a child. Sorry. These days, couples decide not to have a child but We really wanted a child. I joined a job after my graduation. Then I got married. Her name is Jonaki. She is a lot younger to me. After our marriage, she conceived. But she had a miscarriage. We were shocked. Then after two years, we did the planning and tried again. But we failed. She could conceive but couldn't bear it. I kept struggling. I consulted many doctors. The doctor asked us not to try any more. I kept trying to keep her happy. The psychologist said everything will be fine if we both of you can stay together happily but make sure that she doesn't get pregnant again. We accepted it and started living happily. After a few years, we made a mistake. She conceived again. I understood that was a mistake. I asked her to abort it. But she didn't listen to me. She wanted to try it for the last time. It didn't work out. We lost. She is now a patient of acute depression for so many years. Sorry, sir. I didn't want you to express all this. You didn't make me do it. I did it. You know, what feels bad? I became very lonely. There wasn't a thing that I didn't share with Jonaki. There are so many things I want to say for so many years. I sometimes feel that I have been carrying it around. But I never cheated on her. Jonaki, our home, and work. That's all my life is about. I won't ever express these things in my life. That's become a problem. I used to be so angry before. Then I kept my pain aside and started working. That's what I did. She used to sing so well. She stopped singing. She didn't do anything. If she had, then she would have been better. I am always there for her. But for me, nobody is there. I sometimes feel that I should renounce everything. There is a huge problem at home as I am not there. Once I return, everything will be fine. You know what the secret is. I would always be there for her. But even I need support. That's why I need the job and come on tours like this. I know. I know I could give more time to her at home if I quit the job. We could live with the savings I have. But it would have ruined me. When I am at home, I accept everything. I get away for some time after a while for my salvation. I am sorry. I am really sorry. I go home because of her. But I also get away because of her. It's quite late. Did you want to make a call? There is no network here. No, I don't want to make a call. Go to sleep. - Pour me a last drink. I am asking you to sleep. - Pour a drink. That's not right, Mr Sen. This is the last one. Bhaskar. Bhaskar! Bhaskar! Bhaskar! Bhaskar! Bhaskar! Bhaskar! How far is the hospital from here? It's very far. It's near Ben's house. Take hot water in the flask. Let's take the car. Okay, sir. (Local language) (Local language) - Hello. (Local language) - Can you hear me? Hello! - His name is Bhaskar. Bhaskar? Bhaskar? Bhaskar! Can you hear me? - Bhaskar. Bhaskar! (Local language) Let's go out. Micheal. Ben, is there a toilet here? Please manage on the streets. Is there no other hospital here? No, sir. This is the only one. Sir. Sorry, sir. (Local language) He passed away. What do you mean by passed away? Did he have fits before? (Local language) Cardiac arrest. (Local language) (Local language) (Local language) We have to make a call to the office. The doctor would give a death certificate, right? Yes, sir. Sir. We should let his family know. People at the office would arrange for it. We should leave soon. There would be too many formalities at the airport. Don't be late. Sir, it would take some time to get the certificate. How would you take him down? Ambulance. And then? (Local language) (Local language) (Local language) (Local language) (Local language) Raju, should I open the gate? Would you take the payment today? I have been asking for a week. Did you get the time now? I couldn't get it due to the rain. I will get it later. You got up so early? How is she? Did she get up? - She would. I am making coffee. Sir. I need leaves for a few days. It's been a while that you came back. Let me go home now. Let me think. Get me the coffee. I will take it. And give me tea. Listen. The way she has been acting after you returned, I couldn't have dealt with it if you had not been here. She didn't take the medicines last night. She wakes up in the middle of the night. I couldn't sleep last night. I won't go to office today. Get some sleep in the afternoon. Get some sleep in the afternoon. One can't sleep at that hour. What happened? You are still lying down? Get up. Good morning. What? Good morning. Get up! Good morning. Biscuits? Not those. Get me cookies. You were angry with me yesterday, right? I know I just lost it. You didn't take your medicines. They are of no use. You must take them every day. You can't skip it. Don't irritate me in the morning. Manju is just like you. You have trained her and you go away. And she irritates me. What will you have in the afternoon? - Good morning. Good morning. Are you fine now? Yes, tell me. What should I say? You are not saying anything. I can't say it over a call. I get it. That means you are not going to the office today as well. No, I will be at home. Okay, bye. I am coming over. Have you quit your job? No, I let them know. I don't think I can join work soon. Actually, I can't imagine going there. Seems to be quite impossible. Was there any problem at the airport? No, the client helped us a lot with that. He helped us at the airport. Is he a localite? Yes. Our driver was very helpful. His daughter is an air hostess. She informed the airport staff. They really helped with post mortem. Formalities and everything. Did you meet his family members? I can't do that. His family members came to the airport. I didn't meet them. I left in the office car. Does Jonaki know? No. How is she? Who? - Jonaki. Is she fine? She is fine. She is positive I feel. Why are you smiling? I am your brother. Why do you get formal with me? I understand that you had to face it and now you are at home. Speak up. You started it again. You think a lot. That's the problem. Everyone thinks a lot. But you are fine. Right? You are ignoring it at this age. You drink every day. When did you get yourself checked for sugar the last time? Is this the rebellion from college? Or is it your will to die? She got up. The water is getting hot. Have a shower. I'll serve the food. Give me some fruit juice. Fruit juice at this time? - Good morning. You said you were hungry. - What? When did you come? - A while back. Did you get up now? Yes, it's been raining since morning. I was feeling lazy. Okay. I am going to leave. What? - Won't you have lunch? No. I said I would be back before lunch break at office. I have a meeting after that. - What is this? I asked Manju to cook 'khichdi'. Leave after lunch. Would there be a fry? I need an egg. - You'd get fish and egg. Have a seat. I will serve it. Raju, here's the money for the newspaper. I am in a hurry. I will take it later. I washed the curtains. Even the table cover. Do you need a recipe for cooking this? Will you please keep quiet? I keep quiet when you are not there. Who can I speak to in this house? Good morning. Can I get some tea? - Yes. Stop cleaning and take a shower. Here. A dish made by the recipe given to us at our wedding. Won't you go to work? Is there a problem that I am at home? There is no problem. What have you done to yourself? Is something wrong to work? No. You don't usually stay at home. I don't remember the last time you took leave. But now you are at home all day long. Ma'am. Have lunch as he made it with love. Please stop it. There is so much talk in the house. So much noise. I can hear it clearly. You know that I am not used to this. What have I done that I usually don't? You saw that I was sleeping. Why did you draw the curtains then? The light gave me a headache. It was quite late. You weren't sleeping. - That doesn't matter. I was lying down. What is your problem? Do you lie down with me? Do you remember when we slept together the last time? It's a problem for me when you turn on the light to read a book. When you get up early in the morning. It bothers me. You have never adjusted in your life. That's why you don't have to do it now. Calm down and have food. I don't feel like. You forced me to eat. Have lunch. I would sit by you. Save some for me. I would have it. She wants coffee. I won't make it. Don't laugh. I won't make it. Make it. That would make her stay awake for long. She would sleep. Don't mind. She is asking for coffee for a reason. It's because you are here. She is showing you that she is awake. - Manju. Don't talk like that. That's your problem. That's true. She doesn't take the medicines as prescribed by the doctor. She takes it when she wants. The same thing again. What do you mean? Yes, that's the problem. You are always at home. That's why she can't take the medicines. You don't get it. That's why I had to spell it out for you. Why didn't you stop her? That's strange. Don't you know her? What happened? What happened? All the medicines are there. None has gotten over. I would get more if they were. I want to see the prescription. - What prescription? What is this? - You're taking more sleeping pills. There are two strips missing. - I don't take them. I don't take them. - Don't lie to me. You are lying to me every day. I should stop going to office and stay back home every day and look after you. Who told you all this? - Nonsense. That old woman. - The same thing again. She let you know everything once you returned. What happened to her today? Wait. - Listen! Hey. Jonaki. Jonaki. - You still have a habit of telling my husband about me. Jonaki, what's happening? You came here when my mother-in-law was there. - Come. Then you stayed back. I asked you to mind your business. Don't take yourself to be the owner of the house. What is happening? Go inside. You want to see the medicines, right? You want a count. You want to see the medicines, right? Here you go. Here. So many medicines. All over. I told you that they are all over. I can't do it any more. I have a terrible headache. I couldn't sleep for two nights. I can't bear it any more. My head is aching a lot. I can't bear it any more. Here you go. The medicines and the bill. She is still sleeping. Do you want something? You wanted to go home, right? You may. I would go later. - No, you may go. Would you be able to manage alone? "It's raining." "It's pouring heavily." "It's raining." "It's thundering." "It's raining." You didn't tell me a story after returning this time. There is no story to be told. I understand when you hide something. You know that. I felt that I haven't taken leaves in a long time. That's why I informed them that I won't come to work for a week. You took a leave for that. "It's raining." Yes. - You are lying again. "It's raining." Here. Why did you play this song all of a sudden? When you went away this time, it was raining all day long. I have been missing this song since then. You used to sing this song. Picnic, get together, on all occasions. Have it. I asked you to have it yourself. You act so childishly at times as if you are sick. I am not sick. I am disturbed. You are crazy. That's what I said. Listen. You didn't tell me the story. You used to tell me everything earlier. Who do you tell it to now? I haven't in a long time. Nobody is there to hear it. "It's raining." "The monsoon is on its way." "The monsoon is on its way." "It makes me happy." "The monsoon is on its way." "The monsoon is on its way." "The monsoon is on its way." "The monsoon is on its way." Why didn't you tell me about it? Why didn't you tell me? The strangers are your own. - "It makes me happy." Am I no one to you? You called me. - "The monsoon is on its way." "It makes me happy." "My friends are singing out of happiness." "My friends are singing out of happiness." Hello. Sanjit. - Biplab. When did you come? - A while back. How are you now? - I am fine. Listen. Ask Kajal to take the bills of the tour from me. Okay. That can be done later. Okay? - No, take it. Bye. - Okay. I had called. Arup said he is in trouble. Just leave him alone. That's why I didn't. I do understand what you are going through. Just take it easy. If you need more leaves, don't hesitate. I still can't process it. It's just so unfor... - What will happen to the project? I haven't blocked any site. What do you think? Am I worried about the project? We have a goodwill in the market. Trust me. I can handle this. I just want you to be okay. I went there. It was just unbearable. Where? Bhaskar's home. What happened? I am hungry. Will you have lunch with me? No. I need some crowd. Mr Pandey, did you get the food? Keep it in the pantry. At Mr Sen's table. You too have lunch. For how will you be here? I will be here. Why? Do you want to go out? No, Shyamal wanted some help. I would leave after that. Let's go. Did all of you go? I went once. On the day of the cremation. Mohur is going there frequently. Good. That's good. I haven't met his wife yet. She wasn't there that day. I think I am going to see her one of these days. I am feeling like seeing her. Mohur said the child is sweet. Child? Whose? - Don't you know? The day you returned. He had a daughter the day after. I think you should go and see her. She was asking about you. Why did he go in such a situation? One second. Yes, Mr Anoop. Tell me. What's the problem? I mailed you. Please check your old records. We have been associated... Yes, tell me. Has Manju left? Yes, she left a while back. Why? Do you need anything? No. That's fine. I would come home late. Is everything fine? Yes. Bye. Where is Mitra press? Take a left from that lane. - Thank you. The girl is so sweet, right? - Yes. What happened? Nothing. Wait. Wait. Don't do this. Are you from Bhaskar's office? Biplab, right? I am his uncle. Nitai. Greetings. Ruma. Yes. Tell me. - Biplab. From Shonai's office. Hey. - Come. I asked everyone about you. Why didn't you come? I heard that you have become weak after returning. Obviously. It must have affected you a lot. Thank you for coming. For everything. You brought him with much care. I couldn't see him. I was in the hospital. I heard it from everyone. You are the last person he met. You know how long I have been waiting to see you? He gave me your phone number before he went on the tour. I thought about it to call you to come and see me. But I didn't. I knew that you would come. For our daughter at least. I didn't know that you had a child. I got to know about it today at the office. He told me a lot of things. But he didn't tell us that his wife was expecting. If we knew... I know. He was a little crazy. He was not sure of leaving as well. He had just joined the company. He was going on a big tour for the first time. He didn't want to make an excuse in the beginning. Even I had asked him to go. What would happen? I was given a date for the delivery. He was returning two days before. I would have been admitted after he returned. And delivery the next day. He had decided to work very hard for one year. It was all really really well planned. (Local language) (Local language) (Local language) Mom? - Yes. My mom and dad have come down? They really wanted me to have the baby in Siliguri. But Bhaskar and I wanted to stay together here at the time of the delivery. That's why mom and dad have come here. My in-laws are not letting me go away. Mother-in-law has asked me not to leave at least for 3 months. He had told me. That he would get you in this house after he returns. I am so happy to have met him. And spent so much of time with him. He was like a kid. I was a nobody to him. He was still bothered about me. I told him everything about me. When he got to know that I don't have a child, he didn't tell me that he is going to be a father. Have tea. I must leave. Wait for a while. (Local language) (Local language) (Local language) - Mithu. (Local language) (Local language) (Local language) - Ask him to shut it. (Local language) He loved rains. And music was everything for him. He had named her, Karjari. Won't you eat? It's late. Manju had called. She boarded the train. Will you sing a song for me? Song? You are crazy. Let's have dinner. Sing karjari. I feel like listening to it. What is all this? Sit. Have a seat. Please sing to me. Hey. "It's raining." "It's pouring heavily." "It's raining." "It's pouring heavily." "It's drizzling." "It's drizzling. The small drops of water." "It's been a while."
