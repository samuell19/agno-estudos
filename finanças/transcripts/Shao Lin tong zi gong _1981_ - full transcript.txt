(dramatic instrumental music) (grunting) (weapon whistles) (grunting) (dramatic instrumental music) Our boss disguised himself in Goldenberg. He was planning something very special. A big deal. But he was arrested by security. Goddamn it! Let's go to Goldenberg and kill the bastards, save the boss! Come on, let's go do it! You're not going. Boss said we stay calm. He'll be taken to the city, and they will have to pass through Sunset Valley along the way. So, brothers, we go to Sunset Valley! (peaceful instrumental music) [Man] Come on. (grunting) (calm instrumental music) - Hey, let's go. - Yeah. (grunting) Hey, come on, come on out, everybody! Come on, let's go. (exciting instrumental music) Come on, everybody, the other team is gonna fight a foe, come on! Let's go, come on. [Woman] Come on. (shouting) (exciting instrumental music) (shouting and chattering) Hey, hey! Hey, don't push! Don't push. Where do you think you're going? (mocking shouting) Let's see where they're at. - Come on. - Right. (percussive instrumental music) (boys shouting and cheering) Come on, brother. You can do it, come on! Come on, brother, what are you waiting for? (shouting and cheering) (cow lows) Hey, hey, Brother Ting, you reckon you'll make it? Go away! (grunts) (cow lows) (shouting) (dramatic instrumental music) (shouting and clapping) Wow, Chin-Yan, Ting-Chu is fantastic. You see, he's stronger than that great big bull. Hmm, and that's all he's good for. He's just muscles. And there's nothing great about that. Wow, all you Amazon women are here as well? Hmm? Chu-Yan, you're gonna be Brother Ting's fiancee. Careful what you say. Or he just might dump you. I'm gonna shut your big mouth! Hey, come on. (thuds and grunts) My ears. Hey, my mom said a man shouldn't fight a girl. You don't see a dog fighting a lady dog. (laughing) (clapping) Tippy, come on, show the girls, show the girls, come on! Come on! Tippy, yeah! Woo ho! (grunting) (fleshy smacks) (groaning) Hey, Brother Ting, you all right? Hey, hey, Brother Ting. Wake up, come on, get up. Oh, come on. Shh! (tense instrumental music) Hey, listen! The village is on fire! Quickly, look! (tense instrumental music) Come on, let's put it out! [Man] Come on, come on, let's go, quickly! (shouting) (fleshy thuds) (groaning) (fleshy smacks) (grunts) Brother, brother! Brother! What's happening? - It must be some bandits. - Brother! Brother! Damn it, so there's still a lot of you left, huh? Come on! (fleshy thuds) (grunts) Goddamn it. So I see you're a bunch of little devils. Do you know some kung fu? (Shouts) (fleshy thunks) (grunts) Hey, get going. - No, we won't go. - No, we won't go. (weapons clack) (grunts) Get going now, or we'll get wiped out. - All right, everybody! - Come on, run for it. - Quickly! - Come on. - Run! - Come on, get moving! Come on. (fleshy thuds) (grunts) (tense instrumental music) (flare whizzes) (tense instrumental music) Leopard, Tiger. Search the hill. Kill everyone on sight. - Right! - Right. Lion and Bear, search the village again. - Let no one escape! - All right. (weeping and whimpering) Goddamn you, bandits, you're murderers, animals! I swear I'll get my revenge on you! Hey, bad news! Chin-Yan, Ting-Chu, I saw two bandits coming here. Listen, everybody! The bandits are coming. Go, hide yourselves. Play hide-and-seek with them. Don't let them find you, all right? Right, you go that way, we'll go this way, come on! - Come on, let's hide. - Quickly. (tense instrumental music) Huh? (Giggles) (tense instrumental music) (chuckles) Mmm. I'm gonna, I'm gonna take this girl. Get lost. Tell me, where are the others? It's a rule you must find them yourselves. I'm not gonna help you, huh! Little devil, you will die! (smacking) (grunting) (laughing) I've always liked sporty girls like you. You wanna play with me? (weapon whistles) (grunts) Hide yourselves. (fleshy smacks) (grunts) Get going. - Go on. - Quickly. Go on. (tense instrumental music) (fleshy thuds) (grunts) Get going. Huh, I'll wipe out this whole village. Stop! (groaning) What's going on? Father, they are all bandits. They've killed a lot of people in our village. [Girl] They killed my mother and father as well. Buddha bless you. They're all small children. What have they done wrong to you that you want to kill them? Damn bald head, it's none of your business. (weapons clang and whistle) Old Man Dragon Pole. (clapping and cheering) Are you a Shaolin monk? I am Yuan-Fa. If you're smart, you'll keep your nose out of this. Buddha is merciful. It is my duty to help. [Man With Club] Then I'll send ya to heaven right now to see the Buddha. (weapons clang) (grunts) (fleshy smacks) (grunts) (weapons clang) (grunting) (clapping) (weapons clang) (groaning) - Come on, come on. - Yeah, right. [Man In Cape] Let's go, let's go. (clapping and cheering) They really are Shaolin monks? That's true. Brother, that little monk was using Shaolin kung fu. I'm sure of it. Brother, what shall we do now? If they're Shaolin monks then it will mean big trouble for us. If they interfere with us then our plans will be finished. You know, the escort team will be here in a few days. There's one way. Tell our brothers to watch the roads. Then they can't go and inform the city security. (peaceful instrumental music) Those two men belong to the gang that people generally call. The Nine Devils. They commit every crime that you can think of. Actually, I once had a fight with their head Golden Tiger years ago. I beat him, and he promised that he'd never return here. So why do you think that they've come back to this place in Sunset Valley? Now your village is only a poor place. I'm sure that they come here for a very particular reason. Let's go to the city and report this. What do you think about that? [Abbot] Silly girl. Do you think these bandits are so stupid? I'm sure they've blocked all the roads to the city by now. And I'm not sure if I can get so many of you out of here safely. Tell me, Abbot, what made you and your student come here? That is because I have an appointment with a Japanese friend. We're to meet in this village. Teacher, I'm afraid we're short of food. All right, I'll do something about that. It's getting late now. You'd better all go and get some sleep. [Villagers] Yes, Abbot. (peaceful instrumental music) Ting-Chu, food is a big problem. Although the abbot says he can do something, I'm sure that he's gonna have difficulties. Well, what do you think we should do then? Let's go back to the village and steal some food secretly. (tense instrumental music) Brother Ting, shall we go in now? Tow-Ee, don't need you. [Tow-Ee] Well why not? You stay and watch that fat guy. [Tow-Ee] Right. Hey, come here. - Yeah. - Yeah. Now remember, go to your homes for food and clothes, but don't take too much. It'll slow you down, got it? - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, let's go. (tense instrumental music) (grunting and shouting) It's you. [Man In White] Come on, quick. Let's go. (tense instrumental music) (chickens cluck) Shh. (chicken squawks) (tense instrumental music) (urine dribbles) (sighing) (chicken clucks) [Peeing Man] Huh? (tense instrumental music) [Man] Shh. (tense instrumental music) (cawing) Strange. Cocks are crowing, but it's after midnight. Oh, they must be hatching eggs. (tense instrumental music) [Ting-Chu] Let's go. (shouting and laughing) [Man] Touch it, take it, come on. Come on, touch it. Ow, what are you doing? What are you doing? I was just testing to see if it's ready. You wanna take it. (people chattering) (shouting and cheering) [Man] Come on, kill this one now. [Man] (chuckles) That's right. [Man] Hurry, come on. (exciting instrumental music) (shouting) [Man] You can't take that. [Man] Harder, cut harder, come on. Hey, hey. That's right! (clapping and cheering) (dramatic instrumental music) Teacher, how can we let them kill those chickens in front of the temple? Yuan-Fa, meat and wine don't matter as long as Buddha's in your heart. Don't forget, they're just normal young children. And as children, they must have nourishment. [Yuan-Fa] Teacher. That's enough. If it's sinful, then I'll atone. Teacher. You see anything when you went out to collect wood? Nothing, teacher. Everything that happens must have a cause. These bandits must be planning something important. Watch out for them. Teacher. You once said the famous Japanese martial artist Tuneka-san is coming here on a cultural exchange. What if he runs into these bandits? What'll we do? Tuneka-San is quite able to protect himself, but still, we will not fight unless it is necessary. (birds tweeting) Papa. Here. (peaceful instrumental music) Papa, the Chinese monk we come specially to see, is he really as skillful as you say he is? (chuckles) Our martial arts originated from China, and Shaolin kung fu is the best of all Chinese martial arts, and Master Wisdom is among the best teachers in Shaolin. So have we come here mainly to learn martial arts from the Chinese? There's no end to studying. When Master Wisdom visited Japan, he found that our martial arts were versatile, but not practical. So I think that he can help us to improve the Japanese martial arts. Good! I hope that he'll take me as his student. Then I can learn the best from both countries. All right, let's eat. We have to get going. (boy speaks foreign language) (dramatic instrumental music) Hey, boss, we're all here. [Man] We're all here! (laughing) Goddamn you! So you want our prisoner? Get them! - Right! - Right! (weapons clang) (grunting) (fleshy thunks) (grunting) (weapons clang) (fleshy smacks) (weapons clang and whistle) Boss, we'll get you out. (weapons clang) (grunting) (weapons whistle) (grunting) (grunting) (fleshy thuds) (groaning) (fleshy thuds) (grunting) (weapons ring) (grunting) (fleshy thunks) (grunting) (weapons clang) (grunting) (shouting) (weapons whistle) (weapons clang) (grunting) (fleshy smacks) (grunting) (groaning) (dramatic instrumental music) (laughing) (dramatic instrumental music) Boss, we made it. How long have you been here? Three days. We did everything according to your plan. Mm, very good. I purposefully let myself get caught for the information that we needed. (chuckling) Goldenberg's gold will go to town during the monsoon season, and Sunset Village is one of their stops. Now, brothers, if we are successful then we'll have all the money that we need. (laughing) Uh, well, brother, but we've got problems here. [Boss] Hmm? Boss, we saw two Shaolin monks in Sunset Village a few days ago. Oh? Did you fight them? I didn't, but Lion and Leopard did. And they were beaten by them, so they may be a problem for us, so... Just kill both of them! Boss, but Shaolin kung fu is... Brother, just think about it carefully. If those Shaolin monks are really so goddamn good, why didn't they come to you then? (chuckles) Damn it, I should have thought of that. Brother, not your fault. Everybody is scared of Shaolin monks, I know. Come on. [Man] Let's go. (dramatic instrumental music) [Man] Boss, there's no one inside. (laughing) Don't you worry, they won't escape from us. They got those kids with them. They can't go far. This village is surrounded by hills, and there's only one way out. And you're watching that, so they can't use that road, huh? (laughs) [Man In Yellow] But, brother, then... There's only one road up that hill. (children singing in foreign language) Yuan-Fa, tell them to take a rest. Right. Attention, please. Now these bandits are not gonna leave us alone. They will definitely come after us. So, temporarily, we're gonna stay in this cave. Abbot, your kung fu is good, so why can't you catch them? Now that's because there are so many of them. And there's only Yuan-Fa and me. I'm afraid we can't protect all of you. But what if they find us then? Then Buddha will bless you all. Oh. Buddha bless me, Buddha bless me, Buddha bless me. Yuan-Fa, since I fell ill a few weeks ago while coming here, I seem to be getting worse, and I'm weakened now. Therefore, I've decided, starting from tomorrow, I'll teach these kids Shaolin Tong-Chi style so that they're able to protect themselves. You'll have to push them and guide them. Teacher, some of them are still so very young. If I push them, I'm afraid... But they do need to start young with Tong-Chi because when they're small, their bones are still soft and flexible, and that's the secret. Plus, being young, they learn very fast. Yuan-Fa, it's for their own good. We have no time. We must go and train them hard. Yes, teacher. (water gurgles) [Abbot] The first stage of Tong-Chi style is to immerse the children in cold water until they become very cold. And then rub their bodies to stimulate the circulation. Then bathe them in medicinal water. This will toughen their skins. And it builds up their resistance to heat and to cold. Also, to external force, thus preventing serious injury. (peaceful instrumental music) Now the second stage is to slap their bodies. First, with your palms. Following this, with wooden boards or wooden poles. (smacking and grunting) Chin-Yan, you okay? I'm fine, come on. Let's continue. [Abbot] And, finally, we use the sandbags. These should then cover the places that were missed by the wooden pole or board. This will turn your muscles really hard. (thudding and grunting) The most difficult thing in Chinese kung fu is to have pliable bones. To become supple enough, one has to practice for a very long time. But this does mean that you can sustain more punishment without it causing you serious injury. Hey, come on, quit, no, no, no, you're hurting me, hey. Hey, hey, no, no, no, let me go. Come on! (tinkling instrumental music) Toe jumping. Try to jump as high as you can. Keep your knees and your legs straight. This will build up the muscles in your legs. (tinkling instrumental music) Fourth stage is to fly. But along the ground by doing somersaults. This way, one can move quicker and further. (grunting) Beating water is the next stage. (splashing) The speed must not be too fast or too slow. Breathe in and retract your fist. Breathe out and strike out. Each of your blows must be strong, and keep your arms close in to your body. (grunting) Catching claws are mainly for attack. It has two stages. The first stage is barehanded. Catch! Withdraw. These are the basics. (grunting) Catch quickly! (grunting) Tight withdrawal. The second stage is to move force in your fingers. To take a firm grip on the thing. (cracking) Now we'll practice closing hands. In this, you use your palms to grip and to twist. (speedy instrumental music) When you've mastered this, you can break anything in your hands. (crunching and cracking) (rapid instrumental music) Mm. (grunting) (fleshy thunks) No love, no lust. Concentrating one's mind totally. That is the secret of kung fu. The energy, the air, the spirit, that's the true self. Now if you follow these rules then you'll become strong in both body and spirit. (grunting) (fleshy smacks) [Man In Pink] Hey. Hey, hey, hey. - Huh? - Who's that? Hey, where have you come from? We come from Japan to visit a friend. - Huh? - Who's that? [Papa] Huh? Master Wisdom from Shaolin Temple. (laughing) That old monkey's dead. Who are you? How do you know he's dead? (fleshy thunks) (grunting) Because we're gonna kill him, that's why. Says you. You couldn't even get near him. (grunting) (fleshy thuds) (groaning) Brother! (grunting) (fleshy thunks) My son, you go now, and find Wisdom. Father! You do as I say. It's dishonor. (moaning) Yes, sir. (grunting) (fleshy thunks) Huh, so I see you goddamn Japs are skillful. But you're gonna die today. (weapon whistles) (fleshy thunks) (grunting) (weapon whistles) (grunting) (shouting) (groaning) (shouting) (fleshy thuds) (grunting) (weapon clangs) (fleshy smacks) (grunting) (chuckling) (shouting) (dramatic instrumental music) (laughing) (dramatic instrumental music) (weapon whistles) (moaning) (gentle instrumental music) Abbot, he's woken up. (gentle instrumental music) - Brother... - Hey, don't touch him. Master. My boy, you and your brother must have fallen down the hill. My student found you, so he brought you back here. But my brother! He's all right, it's not serious. He'll recover very soon. Master, my father? He isn't here yet, but he'll come soon. You just calm down and rest. I know my father must've been killed. If not, he'd have been here by now. Master, you must help me avenge him. Mm. Don't be so upset now. We'll talk when you're recovered. (gentle instrumental music) (laughing) It's not like that. I'll show you. (giggling) (gentle instrumental music) Yu-Ee, if you walk like that you'll be an old woman when you get to town. I don't really mind about that too much, but my body is so stiff now, oh! (gentle instrumental music) Oh, boy! (pages rustle) (sighs) (footsteps clomp) - Teacher. - What is it? Well, evidently, the bandits are in the village. We can't stay here in these hills forever. I wanna go to the city for help. (sighs) Monsoon season's coming. I'm afraid the city security will not come here. Besides, this is just too far away. I am very worried as to what will happen during the monsoon season. I am afraid the kids. Buddha will bless them all. Now tell me how they're progressing with their practice. Well, teacher, they're safe in the woods now. Good. Starting from tomorrow, we'll teach them the Buddha Union according to their individual specialties. (grunting) (fluttering instrumental music) And strike. (grunting) (fluttering instrumental music) (laughing) [Girl] Hey, someone's coming! Look. [Boy] How are you, ladies? Hey, you can't come in here! You can't come in! (shouting) We don't wanna bathe with you anyway. (shouting) [Girl] Get out, you can't come in here. Go away! (shouting) Go away, stop! (shouting) Don't look, don't look, don't look. Don't look. What's wrong with you girls? Why you shouting for help? (shouting) [Girl] They're over there! Where? I, I can't see. I can't see anything. Uh, eh, no, I can't see anything. Hey, Tipee, how can you see through your hands? All right, then you told me to look, didn't you, huh? (grunting) [Woman] Put your clothes on quickly. [Man] Cover your eyes. All you guys cover your eyes, don't look. Don't you peep at these girls. Come on, come on, cover your eyes. What do you want? You shouldn't have come here to peek at the girls. He peeked at us and he's disgusting. (shouting) If they can bathe, I can bathe, too. What's wrong with that? Very well. You peeked at them bathing, and now you won't admit it. (grunting) (chattering) (cloth whistles) (shouting) (groaning) (splashing) (clapping and cheering) We are now hiding here to protect our very lives. How can you fight each other over such a trivial matter? So it seems you forgot what the bandits did to your people. So-Noah, men can bathe with women in Japan, but this is China. We don't have this custom. You'd better remember this. (shouts in foreign language) Abbot, do they really bathe together in Japan? Every country has its own customs. There's nothing strange about that. Abbot, but we misunderstood him. So-Noah, I'm sorry. (giggling) Hey, come here quick. Abbot! (shouting) Quickly! (dramatic instrumental music) Yuan-Fa, tell 'em to go outside. [Yuan-Fa] Yes. All of you come with me. - Right. - All right. Let's go. (bird tweets) (footsteps clomp) Ting-Chu, what are you doing? Never you mind. (gentle instrumental music) I know where you're going. To steal medicine for my brother. My father told me the Chinese are good. You're willing to risk your life to save a stranger, a foreigner. I really admire you. Take me. If not, I'll kill myself right here to preserve my samurai honor. Mm. Let's go! (gentle instrumental music) (crickets chirp) (dramatic instrumental music) (laughing) (dramatic instrumental music) So you finally got in here. I think you can stay here now. So-Noah, never mind me. Escape if you can. But you... Don't forget, brother needs the medicine. Be smart. Why don't you give up now? It'll be less suffering in the long run. I give up. (fleshy smack) Run quick! [Man] Don't let him get away! (grunting) Your brother's waiting for ya. (grunting) (shouting) (fleshy thuds) (grunts) Hold it! (fleshy thud) (groaning) (fleshy thunks) (grunts) (moaning) (fleshy thunks) (grunting) Hold it, hold it. (fleshy smack) Huh? So he has learned Shaolin Tong-Chi style. But still, you managed to beat him. Huh. But he was definitely hurt internally. And he somehow managed to control it, and so minimize the internal damage. We'll use him as bait to lure out that old Shaolin monkey. - Right. - Right. (percussive instrumental music) Teacher. Buddha bless you. My child, you've suffered. (tense instrumental music) Golden Tiger, come out and show yourself. Oh, so it's you, Master Wisdom. Come out, brothers. (dramatic instrumental music) Old man, so how have you been? It's about time we settled our old score, do you think? A sin, a sin. Master, you told me you'd never return here. Just shut up! (clacking) (groaning) Buddha bless you. Please excuse me. Hmm, you're gonna pay dearly today for what you did to me. (fleshy thunks) (grunting) Kill him! (grunting) (fleshy thuds) (tense instrumental music) You go now. I can get myself out. - Teacher... - Don't hang around. - Right, teacher. - Go! (tense instrumental music) (fleshy thunk) (grunting) (shouting) (fleshy smacks) (grunting) Ting-Chu, run for it! (fleshy thunks) (grunting) The kid's gone. Get the old man for me. - Right. - Right. (fleshy thunks) (grunting) (shouting) (dramatic instrumental music) [Ting-Chu] Master Wisdom, though he was ill, risked his own life to save me, and he was killed. He was truly a man of spirit, a man to be revered. [Chin-Yan] Whereas the abbot is dead now, none of us here understands this manual. It's a great worry to us. So what are we gonna do now? (gentle instrumental music) I'll teach you! Can you? In this manual, the chief teaches us how to combine our forces. In that case, we must stick together and cooperate. Attack them with our strong points. I've got an idea. All of you come in. (funky instrumental music) Listen carefully, you so-called bandits. Those little yellow devils of yours are back. They've returned. Now if you've got any guts, come and get us. Come on, you yellow dogs. Brother, let me take care of it. Hold it! They must've come prepared. So you've no guts? I knew from the beginning you were just yellow dogs. You cowards! Come on, come and get us, you big rotten dogs! Brother, the old monkey is dead. Why are we scared of those kids? (shouting) [Bald Man] Get down quickly, come on, quick. Move it, move it, move it, move it. - Let's go, come on. - Let's split up. Don't let anyone escape. Come on! Run! Get 'em! Where, where? (shouting) Come on, quick. [Bald Man] Come on, come on! [Man] I'll get you! (grunting) (tense instrumental music) Drying your diapers. (laughs) (sticks clack) (grunting) (laughing) (moaning) Huh? (speaking foreign language) (gentle instrumental music) We'll beat 'em! Let's just rush 'em! (shouting) (sticks whistle) (grunting) (fleshy smacks) (grunting) (echoing thunks) (groaning) (grunting) (sticks whistle) (thuds and grunts) (shouting) (sticks whistle) (grunting) (shouting) (club whistles) (grunting) (chuckling) Join the flags. (weapons whistle) (grunting) (fluttering instrumental music) (shouting) (thudding) (tense instrumental music) [Bare-Chested Man] Damn little Jap. So you wanna take revenge? Dad, please give me power to destroy this evil. Destroy evil? (Laughs) (fleshy thud) (groaning) (laughs) Damn Japs, always play dirty. (Laughs) Get up! Get up right now! (laughs) (fleshy thunks) (grunting) (dramatic instrumental music) (shouting) (groaning) Dad. At last, I've avenged you. (shouting) (groaning) Massage her. (slapping) [Abbot Voiceover] Massage to stimulate the blood circulation. This will fetch all the bruising out. (dramatic instrumental music) (grunting) (fleshy smacks) (grunting) [Woman] Pull! [Woman] Serves you right. Good. - Come on. - Come, let's help the others. - Let's go. - All right, let's go. [Man With Bear Makeup] Huh? (comedic instrumental music) (shouting) (fleshy thunk) (comedic instrumental music) Come on, come on, come on. (fleshy thunk) (groaning) (fleshy thunk) (groaning) (chuckles) Come on. Huh? Then what happened? These kids are good. I must go and tell the boss. (groaning) (comedic instrumental music) (shouting) (comedic instrumental music) Man, strange. Oh. (comedic instrumental music) (dramatic instrumental music) [Boy] Help me, get me, help me! (laughing) (shouting) Help me, protect me! (shouting) (thunderous smack) [Man] Hey you won't! (shouting) (weapons whistle) (grunting) [Man] And shoot again, shoot! (weapons whistle) (grunting) And shoot one more time, shoot. (weapons whistle) (grunting) (groaning) (comedic instrumental music) Ready, hit him again, boys! (weapons whistle) (grunting) And again! (grunting) (splashing) (gurgling) (comedic instrumental music) Once more, fire! (weapons whistle) (fleshy thunks) (grunting) (dramatic instrumental music) (fleshy smacks) Phew, Shaolin or not, you don't scare me. Come on! (fleshy thunks) (grunting) [Abbot Voiceover] Water beating can break any armor. (dramatic instrumental music) (fleshy thuds) (grunting) (shouting) (grunting) (thudding) (laughing) (shouting) (fleshy thunks) (grunting) (moaning) (pastoral instrumental music) (shouting) The Buddha Union! (fluttering instrumental music) Bastards! (fluttering instrumental music) (shouting) (thunderous smack) (fluttering instrumental music) (shouting) (fluttering instrumental music) (cracking) (shouting) (fleshy thuds) [Man] Take this! (exciting instrumental music) (shouting) (exciting instrumental music) (fleshy thud) (groaning) (dramatic instrumental music) A girl? (Laughs) That's good. I haven't had a girl in a long time. You're just the thing I need right now. (fleshy thunks) (grunting) You're cute. How dare you. (fleshy thunks) (grunting) (shouting) (fleshy thunks) (grunting) (solemn instrumental music) (sword whistles and clangs) (fleshy thunks) (chain whistles) (weapons clang and whistle) (shouting) Ah, you want to play? You still have a lot to learn. (laughs) Come on, come on. (chuckles) (shouting) (weapons whistle) (exciting instrumental music) (weapons whistle and ring) (grunting) (shattering thunks) (shouting) Little devils. What do you think kids like you can do to me, huh? (laughs) [Boy] Dragon ball! (dramatic instrumental music) Wanna play games? (Laughs) Just show me what you can do then, eh? (grunting) (thuds and grunts) (crunching) Tiger trap! (rhythmic instrumental music) (thuds and grunts) Dad, Mom, I will take revenge for you! (sticks clatter) (shouting) (dramatic instrumental music) [Golden Tiger] You Shaolin students are really pretty good. Where are my brothers? [Ting-Chu] They're either caught or they're killed. If you're smart, you'll surrender now. Then you'll get off lightly. (laughs) Only I let people off lightly. No one has ever talked to me like that. (thuds and grunts) (laughs) Come on, show me what you can do then. (grunting and thudding) Huh, bastard, you've improved a lot. Huh, you scared? You better surrender. (laughs) (shouting) (grunts and thunks) (chuckles) (dramatic instrumental music) (thuds and grunts) This Shaolin Tong-Chi style is really something else. (shouting) (thuds and grunts) (laughs) (thuds and grunts) (chuckles) (exciting instrumental music) (fleshy smacks) (shouting) [Chin-Yan] Ting-Chu! Ting-Chu! Ting-Chu! [Ting-Chu] Chin-Yan, stay away. (thuds and grunts) No, stay back! (thuds and grunts) - Master! - Master! - Master! - Master! (shouting) (thuds and grunts) [Man] Brother! (Speaks foreign language) We're not scared. (laughing) All of you little devils, come on then! I'll tear ya to pieces one by one. (Laughs) (singing in foreign language) (laughing) Singing? You're singing for a funeral. (Laughs) (singing in foreign language) (groaning) (singing in foreign language) (thudding and grunting) (whimpering) (thuds and grunts) [Woman] Brother! Brother!
