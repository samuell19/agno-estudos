Heard you called me a bitch. - I didn't. - What a weirdo. - Ugly fat freak! - Rip her shirt. Who do you think you are? You're such a loser. Who the fuck are you, bitch? I'm the girl with the knife. Who the fuck are you? Change it. Don't let them do that to you, okay? They're assholes. Say it. Okay. Okay what? Okay, they are. They're what? Assholes. Good. Now get the fuck away from me before some rent-a-cop busts me or some bullshit. So where do you go to school? Do you live around here? Did you get that from Hot Topic? My dad won't let me go there. He says it's too intense. Fine. Come buy me a taco. Okay, you got your tour. Get out of here. Leave. Your parents home? Yeah. Not till 6:30. Cool. You want to hang out, right? So let's hang out. Jesus. It's like Whole Foods threw up in here. Cool. I gotta go. My stepmom has some money. You want to see my room? Wow. You really like to cut shit out and tape it together, huh? Let's go. Hey, you got a flashlight? - My stepbrother has one. - Go get it. Go on. - I don't want... - Fucking get it! Hey, I'm sorry I yelled at you. Elly? "Brendan's Dojo." Who's Brendan? Stepbrother. It's like the fucking Death Star in here. Hentai porn. Brendan's a freak. Wait. Oy. Two dollars. You're not supposed to touch his stuff. Don't! Don't? "Karate master eighteen." Jesus Christ, so much karate bullshit. Are these pictures of you? He made me. Get in here. Get the fuck in here! Come on. Do it. Hit it! Fuck him! Say, "Fuck him!" Harder, come on. Fuck him! Come on, harder! You think I'm gonna waste my hard-earned money on rent? Fuck that. My house is free so long as you follow the rules. Rules? Can't live without rules. Who makes the rules? I do. Camp only with people you know. All kinds of shit can happen when you're sleeping. Like what? We live in a transactional reality. Everyone is either buying, selling or stealing. Information is fucking currency. So you don't give anyone anything that they can use to hurt you. Also, stay the fuck away from anyone who says they love you after like a day. Nobody loves anyone. Next, don't fuck with people and they won't fuck with you. And if you do fuck with people, you're gonna run into them again, so... Actually, the rule should be don't fuck with people. Unless you're sure that you can beat the shit out of them. Is that it? No. Stay out of my shit. Come on. Yo, Daphne. Yeah, I wasn't expecting company. You don't even know who you talking to. Magic trick. Dude, that's a five. Hey, you can't be here. Dude, you can fuck off, it's fine. Dude, I'm serious. No panhandling in front of my restaurant. - I'm... - Get going. Come on, get going. - We're leaving. - Thank you. Grab the cup. - Thank you. - Sharing is caring, thank you. Fucker. You're in my spot. - Sorry love, early bird... - Gets their drug-dealing ass out of my fucking spot. Hold up, I know you. It's that chick I told you about that pulled a knife on me. You invaded my alley while I was sleeping you crusty, fucking wannabe. I was looking for my shit you stole outside the Coffee Bean. - Duct-taped in the garbage can. - It was my inventory. Which you took while I was getting busted. - That's a bitch-ass... - If it wasn't me it would have been someone else. The way I see it, sounds like he paid his rent. You can have your spot back tomorrow. Hey, fuck you, man. - Deal? - Fuck it. Hey, 5-O, 5-O. I apologize, you mean, mean ladies. Fuck you. Zip up your sweater. - What? Why? - Just do it. Okay. Got any applications? No. I'm not getting picked up for kidnapping. You're 16. - I'm 13. - Out here you're 16. - And we're getting rid of Elly. - But my mom's middle name was... Close your eyes. Smelly Elly does not even pass the playground test. What the hell were your parents thinking? It's better than Tits. Yeah, well. Anything is better than Tits. No appointments till 3:00, bitch. This was the second-worst day of my life. I was just ranging in Echo Park and I'm cleaning up. Thanks. I've got a week's worth of cash in my cup. And like, there's this girl, who cries for me on a bench. She had this '80s sweatpants. And those, like, green plastic glasses. I'm like, is she a hipster or is she mentally retarded? And this cholo comes up to me, jacks my bank, breaks my nose. I spent the rest of my night bleeding my face off under a giant mural of Johnny Depp. - Wake up. - Hey. What is that thing, anyway? Give it back. What the fuck are you saying? It's... I'm homeless, I have time. It's gonna be for something. Stop. What was the worst? - What? - You said Echo Park was the second-worst day. What was the worst? That's a risk I'm willing to take 'cause I love my customers. Here you go, best dollar Pop-Tart this side of Mar Vista. Drive your shit bucket back to the valley, Rob. Fuck you talking about, Tracy? She's a classic. You owe me a dollar for that. You want one? I got blueberry frosted, confetti cupcake. - Limited edition cinnamon roll. - Fuck off. I told you we don't split up. You didn't tell me that. You don't need to be so harsh. - Just helping the kid out. - I promise he wasn't doing anything. Shut up, sit down over there and take the chips. She looked hungry, gave her a Pop-Tart. What a fucking monster. Jesus. Hey. I even got a flavor you might like. - How much? - 40 each. Twenty or I tell them you tried to solicit my sister. Twenty-five and we're friends again. - Deal? - I'm not your friend. Stay away from him. - That's a rule. - Okay, jeez. There's these things called tiny houses. They're really cheap. And we have the money from my stepmom already. We can save it up, right? We could have a place and like, be a family. Except better. See, there's our garden. There's like a forest around it so nobody would bother us. It's Vancouver. Where my mom is from. It's only 50 dollars to get there on the bus. Angie, I got you. Can't we just get food like normal people? Normal people pay 20 bucks for a bag of popcorn and some gummy bears. Eat. - I'm gonna be sick. - Come on. It's like a treasure hunt. It's not funny, it's disgusting. Fine. If my life's so gross then... Just go back home, then. - Wait... - No, go back home to your fucking brother. Stepbrother. Shit. Go get a corn dog or something. No, that's for our bus tickets. It's for us. Yo, Crystal. Got a present for you. - How you doing? - Sup, Jenga? I don't know them. They're cool. I'll be back. I like your stuff. It's art. Look, I just want you to know I love my wife. Okay. Um, do we... - You taking good care of my baby brother? - What the hell? Aren't you gonna introduce yourself to the nice man? Go on. He doesn't bite. I'm Rusty. - Uh... Kevin. - Isn't he just the cutest thing, Kevin? So... What do we... It's 30 bucks, you just show him what to do. Fuck. Right... I'll wait for you across the street. - Should I... - Bless you. Do you want me to watch? No. Wow, okay. I... So, this one time Rusty did this thing and it was really hot. - Do you wanna hear? - Uh... I'll take that as a yes, okay. So, it's winter and we're living in Minnesota. And Rusty decides he wants to do an outdoor performance. And he climbs up on top of the garage. And our neighbor, this dirty little old man is totally peeping on Rusty like, totally violating his personal playtime space, you know. Yeah. Anyhow, so Rusty strips down to his underwear and then jumps off the garage and disappears. Like, he fell off the face of the Earth. I mean, this is bear country. Little naked Rusty could've eaten by a big bear. Like Cujo, or whatever they are. Getting close, Kev? - Ah. - No rush. So, our neighbor sees Rusty just waist-deep in a snowbank. He puts his little hands above his head and he goes, "Ta-da!" Well, the sight of Rusty there just made him laugh. He actually couldn't stop. I mean, he really, he really couldn't stop. So he had a stroke and he died but... He died laughing, Kevin. Laughing in the snow. Ah! Thank you. You're hilarious. Well, you obviously had no idea what the fuck you were doing. - I'm Tracy. - Rusty. There's a sprinkler by the boardwalk. Yeah. It's not like we're like, dating. You know, it's more than that. Yeah, it always is. I mean he's got to stay behind in Oxnard until school gets out, but I don't even feel like we're apart. - I think I like Ashley. - We knew, like the first time. - He was in the choir room. - Kinky. - Yeah, I know. I don't even like the choir. - Sofia. But then my fucking mom, she picked up the phone while we were talking. - and she started asking all these questions. - Ariel. - Do you like Ariel, Tracy? - We both got really scared. Both of use kind of freaked the fuck out. So, he gave me some money, he told me to come out here and that he'd come and meet me. - How long have you been waiting? - Only like, a month. So Rusty, has Tracy given you a street name yet? - I'm getting one. - A street name? Yeah, maybe we'll let you help us. Okay. Uh... Name of your first pet and the street you grew up on? - That's porn star name. - Pickles Washington? That's... that's awful. - I like it. - Um, what's your favorite cartoon? Winnie the Pooh. Please, not Pooh. I think... Eeyore. Nice. Eeyore. I like it. Eeyore. Let's grab our shit. Let's go home. Can we bring him? Do you wanna come?

Look, none of these people have anything to do... - Excuse me! Excuse me! She's gonna take what you entrusted to her friend here. She's gonna put it up her arm and float away where you can't find her. But I'm not an unreasonable person. So, I propose a compromise.

You are staying here, and this boy is leaving. Now! I'm calling the police. She wants to leave. She's not gonna stay here with you and your fucking kid, so... - Don't... - Yes. Hello. - I'd like to report a... - You want to know why she ran away? It's cause your fucking kid, Brian, or Brandon or whatever the fuck his name is, was raping her. You knew, didn't you? Um, no, I'm sorry. You're lying.

My dad is so fucking drunk, he can't even get a bead and then all of a sudden... Blasts a hole through the side of the trailer. Fucking tears apart the cardboard Christmas fireplace, and I pick up a beer and I smash him right in the side of the head, and we're out! And he's screaming, "Get back here, you cocksucker! I'm gonna fucking kill you!" And Scabius shits his pants. The end! No, no, no, man. So I'm sitting here, drinking with ass scratch, right, and he says to me, "You can't take that shit sitting down," right. So we get this thing of gasoline, throw it all over the fucking car, over the roof, the hood and everything, and his guy hands me a Molotov, lights that shit, and just like the movies, I chuck that son-of-a-bitch up, "Aah! Boom!" flames of destruction, everywhere. That was an anarchist piece of fucking art, man! It was beautiful. I've been in LA looking for your ass a month now. You and me, we're gonna have some fun, huh? Maybe go back out to Reno, fuck shit up a little bit. - You're gonna fucking leave... - Aah! I'd never leave you, bro. What's up? I'm Scabius. I know you.

Come on, Germ, I'll walk you. We don't have to go to Portland, you know. We can go wherever. There's trains up to Vancouver. Then you can find the house. Can't you guys just wait till she comes back?

You left your sister. Shut the fuck up! You left her! After whatever happened to you, you said you wouldn't leave her, right? Just like you told me. You're a liar. You're right. I am a liar. I'm not a good friend. I was using you. This is a fucking picture from a magazine, Elly! It's not real. - I don't fucking like you! - Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm not coming back. I'm not lying this time. Wait. Please don't go. Don't leave me. Tracy! Tracy, I'm sorry. You know, you need dope, I could get it for you. I don't have to like all of my customers, you know. I'll even spot you some. Yeah? Yeah. Come on. Take me with you. Juan Carlo doesn't exactly love you. You're gonna make me wait longer? Come on. They're gonna be up there. For real. You want me to end up with nothing again? Yeah, fine. I'll be an hour. He's cool, right? Yeah. He's cool. Scabius, huh? Like the parasite? ♪ Well, my belly's just aching ♪ For a couple strips of bacon ♪ Hunk of pork And a little pot of brew ♪ What can I do? ♪ Hey, Tracy. Tracy? Hey, I got some Oxy. Tide you over a little bit. You want me to crush it up? I'll use your knife. I'll do it. What if you decide not to share with me? I don't know you. I don't know you either. And I'm the one sharing my hard-earned drugs. Come on. I'll give it back. I promise. God. What? I'll just go all the way upstairs, get my fucking grinder and do it myself. Hey. See? Ladies first. Ha ha. You like that shit, huh?- Whoo. Uh. I'm sorry about the... The parasite joke. Ah. We all feed off of each other. You know, me... Off all of this... And you off of Critter. I get it. You know, if you ask me, you're getting the good end of the deal. Maybe. Yeah. It really rubs me the wrong way when people use my friends. All right. Fuck this. Yeah. Fuck this, right? Where the fuck do you think you're going, huh? You're the fucking parasite. You know that? You keep scaring everyone away, you bitch! Yeah. Never fucking come back. Please don't. Don't! Just like him. I'm just like him. - I'm fucking better than him. - Stop! Every day that I work, I get a gram and Taco Bell. I get my own room. And you don't talk to me when I'm not working. What is this shit for now, like, some webcam shit? Don't give me a stupid name. Got yourself a deal, butterfly. Your office. You want a Pop-Tart? Wait till you see what I found. We are gonna make thousands. Get that thing off me. - Hit me up. - Shut up. Hit yourself. So, quick rehearsal. You found her diary. You know her secrets. Fuck this! Fine. We go handheld. I can't. Oh, come on. Really? You wanna be here, right? She wants to be here. Old enough to know what you want? Hmm? - Yeah. - She's old enough. So, I don't see what the problem is. I've got snacks, there's a nice hot shower, TV. You can even use the pool. Not with her. - We have a verbal agreement. - I know. I'm sorry. We have a deal! I didn't force you to come here, Tracy. Down there in Santa Monica, when I found you, I've never seen you like that. So, I offered to help, to keep you safe, protect you. Who do this to your face, hmm? It could have been anyone. It's brutal out there. Is that what you want? You walk out that door, this is what you're gonna get. Stay here with me, I'll keep you taken care of. - This is bullshit. - This is a gift. I'm giving you a fucking gift! If it's not you, it'll be someone else. I understand you're nervous. It's easy. Now it's a rehearsal, then just do the same thing over and over again. You can do that. Right? It's okay, Tracy. Uh-uh. After. Fine. See? We can always make a deal. - Run! - I'm not leaving without you! Fucking run! Tracy, what the fuck are you doing? - I'm waking him up. - Hold on. God, you're such a fucking wussy. Come on. Get up. - Get up. - Tracy, he's my friend. Your friend kicked Eeyore out on the street. I didn't fucking kick her out. - Where'd she go then? - I don't fucking know. She was about to start turning tricks out there, you fuck, because of you... - You brought her here. - Come on. So what? You really think you're taking care of her? You're a fucking junkie. Right. You're all just fucking better human beings than me, huh? But just so you fucking know, your friend there threw me up against that wall and raped me while you were off on your last score. - That's bullshit. - What you did to me, that's bullshit? Huh? That's bullshit? Yeah. You wanna look at me and tell me that? Come on. Look at me. Look at me. Come on. Fuck you! Look at me. Look at me, you little bitch! Didn't you tell me how you take care of everyone?" 'Cause I don't see you saying shit. Would you go into his bag, get me my knife? No? Well, you fucking deserved it. Tracy. Tracy! - Stop it. - I hate you! Stop! Before Brendan... Before my mom died... And before everything... She would bring me up here and teach me the names of the flowers. I can't take care of you. I know. You have to tell your dad. He won't believe me. He will. I can't. He will. Okay. Trust me. Your dad loves you. You said nobody loves anyone. Dad? This is the story of the girl who saved me.
