Antwerp, "The Jerusalem of the North..." LEVY AND GOLIATH The baby will be born! Thank you. Dear Moses, dear Sarah, may you be blessed like Adam and Eve in their paradise, united as Abraham and Sara, Isaac and Rebecca, and your descendants be as many as the stars in the sky. Mazeltov! To life. Moses! Come here, Moses. Oh, no... - Like I taught you. - Not today. Especially today! Uncle Mardoche', you always do this! You don't marry every day! You'll see, he knows the Bible by heart in his head. At random. Pick! Page 3112, verse 12,560, line 118. "Your breasts..." - My son. - Forgive me, it's not me, it's the Bible. The Song of Solomon. "Your breasts are as little fawns "that run down the mounts of Galahad." Mister musicians, please, would you play Samovar? Samovar? The samovar song. Mazeltov. Congratulations. My sons. This is Brigitte. It seemed the right moment, as you didn't come to my wedding. You neither, Uncle Mardoche'. Nor your son. Yet you live in Paris. Nor you, Aunt Lea. You live in Paris too. Nobody. In 6 years, nobody thought, one Day of Atonement, "It'd be nice to see Albert and his wife and boys." And I said boys. Not goys. What's wrong? Nobody's laughing. Lost your sense of humour? Brigitte will be disappointed. She's convinced all Jews are funny. But nothing's changed in northern Jerusalem. Women here, men there. It's our religion, it's the way we live. Nobody asked you to come. They did. Mum. - Come on. - Look at him. He's not looking at you. If he had his hat, he'd hide behind it. Can you see mein a family where men and women can't touch? Only in public, Albert. You wouldn't be here if your mum and dad did touch a little bit. You can't use umbrellas on the Shabbat. They drink vodka but not Cognac. No ham, no lobster. No shrimp, no crayfish. No horse, no lark, no caviar. Which is more economical. Is that why you renounced the word of God? No, Eli. It's because some Jews do what Jesus said: "Someone hits you, turn the other cheek." We know where that led. Never again. I fight. You're not the only one. Come. To think that Dad... Yes, I know. He died because of me. Sarah! Are you ready? Not yet. What's she doing? God, what's she doing? O Lord God... Half an hour she's been undressing, or dressing, I don't know. Maybe she doesn't want me. Remember the Bible. "Man calls with the mouth, "woman calls with the heart." Page 2640, last line. I'm ready! She's ready. I'll be going, then. Thanks. Moses! One more thing. You smoke too much. Forgive me, but you too. Now I am your wife before God, I will show you what I must never show to any other man. Paris, Montreuil Market... Clothes! All 100 francs! Have a rummage! God, Louisette! I can't hold her, she's in withdrawal. Not a snort in days. He has the hands, legs and eyes of a hunchback but he's not a hunchback. Here. - Eat it with mustard. - Thanks. Who wants merguez? Stop! Shit! Antwerp, the same day... Industrial diamonds. Diamond powder. Don't worry. We've never given Renault cause to complain. Everything's in order. The 3 kilos of diamond powder are right in front of me. It's the best in the world. For abrading, scraping and grinding, it's harder than steel, Mr Ge'vodon. It's already cellophane-wrapped. My men will be at the Gare du Nord as usual. Goodbye, Mr Ge'vodon. Nathan, Moshe, quick! The train goes in 20 minutes! If you miss it... So what? We'll take the next. He just called from Paris. His department closes at 6 o'clock. So hurry! Sale: 2 beds, white, 12 monthly payments, 1895 francs with tax. Is that a bargain? Sale: 2 beds, white, 12 monthly payments, 1895 francs, is that a bargain? You're not interested. One day you'll regret refusing that job. What job? Computers. Professor at Harvard. Apart from the prestige, you'll soon be needing beds. On your wages, 4875 francs a month... I could have gone to Milstein, Stein and Stein and Stein. Me, a lawyer in London? All those businessmen? Become a doctor of law, learn English, and you're in! I'm a workman, Nathan. Days, I work with my hands but at night, my mind is clear for study. Study. The rest, money and all that... Distance yourself from things. All that is vanity fair. Smoking is not allowed. Is that you, Marl'ene? Hang on. Goliath, phone! Yes? Look, bitch, that's 300-grand's worth. You can't pay it back with your sorry ass. I told you, the cops were after me! So, are they popes, monks or priests? Jewish priests. The train arrives at 5.05, Gare du Nord. They're easy to spot. Black coats and beards. Yes! They said they were on the train. - Here they are! - Nathan! Nathan, it's a boy. It's a boy! A boy? Mazeltov. Moses, it's a boy. Mazeltov. It went well. She gave birth at 3 o'clock. - Did she suffer? - Like shelling peas. Come on. Mr Levy! Yes, I'm coming. Is it all ready for tonight? It's all ready. See you tonight, then. Moshe! We're making a bed up, come and sleep in Montmartre. Thank you, Jezabel. Stay on his tail. Where's he taking my coke? Sign here. Here's the cheque. Diamond powder... 3 kilos. 7369 francs, with tax. Mr Nathan didn't come today? Oh, my! They made a mistake in Antwerp. They've given me double. You want it? My order says 3 kilos and I've got 3 kilos. - My boss isn't here... - No matter. Distribute this to the Workshops. See you soon. - Goodbye, Mr Levy. - Goodbye. See you soon. Solidarity meeting for the freedom of Soviet Jews Will the big one fit? Not in this case, but it'll fit in the other. How's it going? A cruise to Leningrad. Chairman of an insurance firm. Moshe! Got the list? Yes. Be careful, it has 200 dissidents' names. Don't worry. Dissidents, gulags... Here's your tea. No, thanks, Aunt Lea. Your son awaits. Shalom. Uncle Mardoche', can you keep my diamond powder? I'll put it in here. If I'm out, you know where to look. Moshe! There. Some bortsch for Eli and Jezabel. It's boiling hot. And strudel for the children. Thanks, Aunt Lea. - There. - See you soon. - Send our love. - I will. Goodbye. Goodbye. It's their right! Everyone has a right to pray in their ancestors' language. Can it. The powder. The powder? Oh, right... I don't have the powder. Not any more. Look. I don't have it. Step this way, sir. The cutest pussies in Paris, 50 francs! - Striptease... - Leave me alone. All for 100 francs! Don't run away, come on in! Don't be afraid. Coming, dear? Fancy a cuddle at 200 francs? Don't hide your curls, I like beards. Moses, my son! Go on! Why do you hesitate? What's with the accent? So? I have several accents! Today I'm using this one. Anyway, who's the Lord? You or me? I warn you, your life is in danger! They're coming! Go on in! Or I'll give you a slap upstairs. Moses, this is a commandment! Well, if it's a commandment... - Is the 28 free? - Yes. Towel. Soap. 150. Pay in advance. - I've only Belgian francs. - That'll do. - Found him? - No, not a thing. Come in. Hello? Please would you get me 537 double-O 15. With a 4 in front. It's very urgent, please. Yes... Thank you. Lovely titfer! I'm double-zero too. With a 4 in front would be very nice. Miss, give me back my hat. My name's Charlotte. And get dressed, Miss Charlotte. - Hello, Le Celtique. - Could I speak to Albert? Who is it? Moses, his brother. Attack, you're dead, defend, you're dead too. Albert! Quick! Telephone, cafe'. - Who? - Your brother. Oh no, it's Mum. Mum's fine. It's me. You're in Antwerp? No, Pigalle. Pigalle, right! Whereabouts in Pigalle? I'm with a... a... A whore! I'm with Miss Charlotte. Stop messing about. Who is this? Where's my present, beardy-boy? One second, Albert. - How much, Miss? - You said 400. - There. - Thanks. Bye! Goodbye and thank you, Miss. Albert? They're after me. They're here. Who is? They're... I can't tell you on the phone. I can explain. It's very serious. I can't leave here. You have to come. - Put this on. - No. You know I can't, Albert. Oh, you can't. You can't! You know something? You're a pain in the arse! You piss me off! Where do you get off? You whistle, I come. Last time you threw me out, but I come! What's serious? Will you tell me or not? Those guys are after you? If they are, it is serious. Because those guys are no... So stick that on and we scram. I saw a bearded guy. Young, in black, with a hat. He went off with Charlotte. When they asked for the powder, I knew they weren't KGB. They're thieves. - Or anti-Semites. - No. To an anti-Semite, ou're a Vision of hell I a nightmare! - If the guy sees you... - Can I speak? - Yes. - Thieves can be anti-Semites. That's true. Can't we keep that one? No. We haven't looked alike in a long time. Quick, let's vanish. Seen a bearded guy in black with a hat? He went up with Charlotte. - Are they still up there? - Charlotte left. I've not seen the guy. They had room 28. The guy must still be there. Absolutely! I am an object, Frangois-Camille, a fragile, sensitive, delicate object. These secret meetings are degrading. I feel degraded. I need protection, I need love and muscles, muscles and love. What's your name? Disappear, queer! Willingly. Frangois-Camille... See you soon. Come on. - What is it? - Don't worry. This way... There. - Come on, Albert. - You too. Don't touch me! - It's nothing to do with us! - Let's go. Two by two. - Let him go! - Get your hands off me. - Shut up and climb in. - You'll regret this! If there's a raid 3 times a week, I'll have to shut up shop, you hear? Got a light, lover boy? Oh, she's shy! You are lucky. You can look, he's a man. "To sleep with a man as with a woman is an abomination." Leviticus, chapter 15, verse 198, thank you. I'm Bijou. Subdue, shampoo, tattoo, taboo! Could you give me a cigarette, please, sir? - Of course. - Thank you. Don't tremble so. What's her name? Frangois-Camille. Relax, Frangois-Camille, they're not so bad. Eh, sergeant? The odd thump in the mouth never harmed anyone. We saw you with the guy, Said! Sir, you have no right to do that. He's your brother. Welcome to the cops, baby! It's the shy ones who react! Bijou! Clear off. Andre'! See to Said. What is this mess? I can explain. You seem smart, you'll understand. Albert! Be quiet. What's this? A curl? A ringlet. That's a beard. "Thou shalt not cut thy beard." Is that Belgian? Hebrew. He's a rabbi. Yes. He's Jewish, Belgian, queer and a rabbi? He's a Belgian Jewish rabbi. You're not queer? No, I'm a diamond cutter, sir. - Hi, Jeannot. - I've nothing, I'm clean. What about us? I'm sick of this! - Can it and sit down. - Sit down, girls. I was in rue Lepic, going down... no, upstairs. Dressed as a rabbi, with this caftan, and... - I'll explain. - No, quiet. Is this a caftan? Yes. It's because in 1725, approximately, but I can find out the exact date, Rabbi Baal Chem Tov adopted the garb of the Miedzyborz princes in Poland. He promoted the duty of joyful adoration, instead of the austere worship of the past, to dispel the shadows from East European Jewish lands. No, the Jewish lands of eastern Europe, because... You can start again, I don't think he got it. Did you get it? Let her go. I want to get changed. - Do it at home. - No, they're waiting. Uncle Mardoche' and Aunt Lea will be worried... Sorry, I have to go. You've been kind, Albert. I'm very grateful. After all that happened, I called and you came. You won't come under threat of death. My family and my world disgust you! No! I want to meet your children. You're still the same! You were a pain at school, judging everyone. At 4, you lectured the lecturer. At 6, you corrected the maths teacher, doddery old Mr... - Mr Blum! His name was Blum! He asked you why you stuck your ringlets behind your ears. - You were ashamed to be a Jew. - No. I've never been ashamed! But once, a girl called me a girl. Is that why you left us? To live like this in this world? With men disguised as women! With drugs, with pigs! I found a family, open-hearted people. They welcomed me despite my crappy Jewish inferiority and superiority complexes! I've a wife, loving kids and a cafe'. Give me that. You don't exist, Albert. You've been assimilated, as they say. You think you eat thanks to your cafe'? Your cafe' has eaten you! - How are you, Mr Dubreuil? - And you, Albert? Fine. Bwana's coffee coming right up. A small black one. There you go, Bwana! How's the news from home? What about me? Don't worry, how could I ever forget you? Don't take advantage or I'll call my wife! Where's Joseph's tea? - How much is the sausage? - 35. I'm taking the boys to school. Arthur! Sebastien! Hurry UP! Coffee? I delivered cocaine to the Renault factory. I called home. There are 18 cars ruined, a fortune in damages. They're not happy. Come on. Waiter! Renault are insured. Paolo, go and serve those women on the terrace! But those you nicked the coke from aren't insured! What's up? Nothing. Sorry. Say something, then! - The ham? - Behind you. - You don't eat that? - 1 boiled, 3 country. - I serve it. - I must keep it on! Look, Moses, you screwed some dangerous guys. 3 kilos of coke! Screwed? We didn't even kiss! Malika? Hello, darling. Yes, 3 coffees, one small, 2 sausage, 1 potted meat. We'll send it right away. Just stay here. Don't say you're my brother. Take Raoul's place. Tell your wife you're in Jerusalem. - I just came back! - Go again. What do you say? Too comic-booky and not cartoony enough. Not cartoony enough, what's that supposed to mean? Why get upset? Put it there, Raoul. I mean it's too dense, there's no movement. I think it looks fine. There's just one problem. I'm sorry. The pharaoh looks the wrong way. And there's a slight error. Because... the temple of Isis, down here, was built under the New Empire. The 20th dynasty, that of Ramses. It says so here, in fact. You see these hieroglyphics? Isis, wife and sister of Osiris, mother of Horus, comforter and magician. What I mean is... This is the war between Thebes and Memphis? You can't have the temple here because the kings of Thebes didn't rule Upper Egypt until around 2027, I believe. I can find the exact date. It was the founding of the Middle Empire. Obviously, then, this temple didn't yet exist. Obviously! Good day to you. Come here! Shut up! Get in there! Last night, Hotel Luna, a bearded guy called Levy. He called someone. What number? - I've no memory for numbers. - Don't push it! It started by 537. With a 4 in front! After that, I swear I don't know! Her name's Brigitte Pommier. The house is 10 km from Bordeaux in the vineyards. They're different but very welcoming. You must come, my mother-in-law is lovely. - Has she made any jam? - Of course! They've made jam for generations. Leave the ball alone! Put your things in the car! Get off your bike, take the guitar and help your brother! Come on, let's get out! And my brother-in-law's a very interesting guy. Why does he say you've the gift of the gab? What's the gab? It's wit, humour, repartee. It's a compliment. My brother-in-law's always paying me compliments. He said to Dad: "You lot always stick together." Who's you lot? Us lot. It's us. Us Belgians. Get off the car. Albert, shall we go? - Come on, boys! - Put that in the back. Right. You close at 8 o'clock. Tomorrow you open at 7. Bread and croissants arrive at 7:15. Don't worry. Paulo, the other waiter, knows what to do. I'll leave the car for Brigitte and the boys but I'll get the train back tomorrow morning. Goodbye, Moses. It'll be fine. Take it easy. And stay here! Here's the phone number if there's any problem. - Thanks. - Bye, then. Goodbye. You're closing early. Can I get a coffee? I'm meeting a guy in 5 minutes. - I was about to go. - Got any hard-boiled eggs? What's your name? Frangois-Camille. I'm Malika. - Can I ask you something? - Sure. Is bar work the best an Egyptologist can do? Degrees count for little... And I'm not an Egyptologist. A small one, please. So you Iearnt all that for fun. Yes. I like words and ideas. You can build anything with ideas and destroy anything with words. You speak several languages? Aramaic, Coptic, Latin and Ancient Greek. - All dead languages? - Some Russian, too. English, German and Yiddish. I'm not much good. It's a little weak. Do you never look people in the eye? I'll make a tea. My God, what do I do? Please, what must I do? I don't know what's happening. Answer, Lord God! Stop it, it makes a din! So what's the use of learning stuff that's no use? Success isn't important. Knowledge is important. Excuse me, but I have to go. I only ever tried to succeed. Succeed in getting out. Of where? It's tough for a raghead. - A what? - An Arab. A girl from North Africa. Where have you been? - I've always lived in Belgium. - Right! Get down. Here! Anyone there? Miss, please... - Move back, please. - But I can't. The 26th Levy was the right one. Who is it? I don't know, they want to kill me. Is there a service entrance? I think so. Le Celtique cafe', Berthier-Courcelles, in the 17th. Coming. Get on! Shit! You know I've taken a big decision? Next year, the boys will do Latin. And I won't be budged on that, Arthur and Se'bastien. I'm adamant! You're witnesses, Grandma and Granddad. No, it's my job, Mummy. Why Latin, Ve'ronique? Why study? Why knowledge? Let me serve you. What use is knowledge, Se'bastien? What do you think is the point of knowledge? Success. Jean-Bernard, I saw that look. I don't mean money. I mean succeeding, being somebody. Whatever job you do. Would you like some, darling? Se'bastien, you want to be a fireman. You'll put out loads of fires, save loads of trees, and be a great fireman. Mummy? No, a pump attendant! Do they have great ones? Of course! The bosses of Esso or Elf Aquitaine are great pump attendants. Here's the salad. Like the cafe'. Jean-Bernard, you haven't been. You should have seen the state it was in! Now it's all blue and wonderful. The cafe"s the result of Mum and Dad's hard work. Hello? Yes. Who? Hang on. Albert! Moses. I suppose it's for you. Moses is my brother. Hello? What? Do not go back to the cafe'! Don't involve the police! If you tell them about the cocaine... I don't know where to go! It's nice weather, go sight-seeing! And meet me at Austerlitz at 7:56! I'm coming. Cheeseburger without onions, fries and a Coke. What do you want? I'm starving. You have any herring? A banana, crisps, hazelnuts and jam on a cardboard plate with plastic cutlery. Is that OK? Yes, but I can't eat without covering my head. - Your brother? - Back in the morning. It's odd, you don't look alike. He's... he talks and talks! - Will peanuts do? - Fine. Thank you. He's involved in coke? - No, me. - You're a dealer? Oh, no! I don't understand at all, it was a mix-up. I did think it was the KGB about the refuzniks. But as I brought back diamond powder from Antwerp, 18 cars were ruined. The killers shot at me... I got two bullets in my hat. It's like at the movies, incredible stuff. Maybe, I've never been. It's not kosher. What about TV? TV isn't kosher either. Because you see things that... Aren't kosher. A Woman's eyes are beautiful. It's awful. Especially Kabyle ones. Kabylia of Babors or Djurdjura? Les Minguettes Kabylia. It's not the desert, but we know about survival. I don't do tradition. It's more "Get lost and leave me alone." That's one way of looking at it. A bottle of Vittel. - Who is it? - Don't move. You have any Gitanes? "Dirty Jew"? - I said nothing. - You said "dirty Jew"! What? Arab? Dirty Jew or dirty Arab? - I never said that! - Raghead, you said! You heard that! He called me a raghead! - How much was your diamond? - 15,000 dollars. 15,000 dollars! You were robbed. - Was I? - What... I smell of nigger? Do niggers smell bad? Don't get upset. You smell of lavender. I don't know why he said that. - Let me go! - Let him go! Stop speaking like a prophet, Frangois-Camille. My name isn't Frangois-Camille, it's Moses. Exactly, Moses. Prophets have always been pains. Anyway, the telly announces enough disasters! What was that? "Love without love isn't a sacred act"? It's bullshit! Love is invented, spontaneous, risky. It's an accident! You love on the floor, in the grass, in the street, where you want, when you want. But I get a hundred times more out of life than you. I make the most of everything, every second. Do you await enlightenment? To me, enlightenment is... You open a text and everything's dark. Suddenly there's light, and you understand what they meant 5000 years ago. You're smart, the world belongs to you. - I come 100 times a day! - Not me. It's all important. Even negative things, as bad as they might seem, contain a divine spark. Even you, Malika. - Thanks. - No, I didn't mean that. But to me, you're temptation. Madness. But you're also a divine spark, Malika. You annoy me. But I love "divine spark"! Under a bridge? Why? Why is Malika involved? We were next to each other under the bridge. A bateau-mouche passed, her face was lit up, it was lovely. We spent such a night. The guy I mentioned, you know what Malika said? "We well and truly screwed those guys". Screwed them? I don't even know her surname. It's Laoussine. Her dad has 3 wives and 14 kids. She's an Arab! That bothers you? No, it doesn't, but you're married. I've done nothing wrong, you mustn't think that. I was proud of you. My little brother was Samson! Cuts his hair and falls for the first bird that passes! In the Bible, it's... Give the Bible a rest! You disappoint me. When you're not exasperating, you're disappointing! Cafe' torched: Anti-Semite attack? Bastards! Scum! Anyone hurt? No, it was during the night, 4 am. Lucky we slept under a bridge! What will Brigitte say? It's material damage, it doesn't matter. Not as much as if... It's material. Material? Ten years of my life? Ten years of fighting to find the money. Everyone wanted that cafe'! Just go. We're not on the same wavelength. You don't know what it is to fight. You'll never know. Go back to your cocoon! You're out of step here! Plus you're arrogant and insensitive! You're a pain, Moses! Go away! It's my fault. You're right, I'm out of step, forgive me. I'm sorry for your cafe'. Would Mr Levy come to the information desk. Mr Levy. It's urgent. Hello? But I don't have the powder, I told you. Wait, I'll get it. I'll get it. No. Nobody. Please, don't hurt her. They've kidnapped Malika. They want their coke. Montreuil, tonight before 6, in a disused factory. The cafe' fire was them. It was a warning. They'll taste the powder and see. We'll be killed! Malika too, if we take 3 kilos of diamond powder. Don't go near the factory. We've no Chance, they'd massacre us on their turf. Listen to your brother. First we have to flush them out, lure them out of their hole. - Where's the powder? - Uncle Mardoche"s. Let's go. Would you like any cocaine? He doesn't want any. - Like any, sir? - What is it? No. Got time for me? 3:15. It's good stuff. Half Colombian, half Arabica. OK? - I dig this jacket. - You want it? - If you do, it's easy. - Your jacket for mine? Swap? - This one's 2000. - 2000? Isn't that good? OK. Shit! Shit! Sorry, the bag broke again. - Please excuse me. - What's that, flour? No, Colombian from Antwerp. Give it here! You're muddle-headed. I've told you 500 times, put drugs in paper bags! It's not wise. A cop, a gust of wind, anything... Clear off! Yes... - Here. - Sorry, sir. Goliath, two guys were powdering the neighbourhood. The idiots mentioned Antwerp, if you see what I mean. You'd best get them before the cops. Did you have your dick cut off in Rio? Shout "Heil Hitler"! I said shout, bitch! Let me go! The cow! Undress her! OK, Moses? Frangois-Camille, wake up, baby! Quick, Bijou's in trouble! Quick, girls! You're bleeding, love. Fighting men are handsome. But nobody moves when girls get raped! Let's go opposite, I'll see to you. - It's all right... - Come on, help him, girls. Quickly. Frangois-Camille, your bag! Oh, first aid! Gently, you'll hurt him. Oh, it's nothing. No real harm done. Don't be scared, ducky. Clean it with alcohol. Gently. Give me your scarf. - Does it hurt? - I'll see the other baby. Does it hurt? It does. A Cognac. Double! OK, Bijou. Here, drink. I don't feel well. I have to... Listen, Prince of Sodom, chief of Gomorrha, may hell fire destroy you! Love it. Who said that? I am a fisherman fallen in the water. I am a fish in a tree. Albert's right, I don't know how to live. I judge others, I judge Albert, his life, who he sees... And who does he see? Albert has a heart this big. He's funny, brave, not just physically, because you need Courage to rebel against your upbringing, its prejudices, its milieu. I know that. And instead of Understanding and helping him, I was hard, inflexible, but he left everything for love. He'd do anything for those he loves, even those he doesn't. When I called, he came right away. Why? You have problems? When I was small, if anyone touched me... So he's your first love? Yes, he's my brother. Yes, I have problems. I'm lost, Bijou. I've done incredible things. Confess, it'll do you good. I'm sick of being taken! Leave me alone. They tried to beat me up. Don't touch! - You think I'd want to? - Go back inside, girls. Go indoors. Come on, hurry. That's better, that thing's warm. Well? First, a girl's been kidnapped. Goliath, obviously. The ransom is 3 kilos of cocaine. The two kids aren't gay, they're brothers. It makes no odds. It's very important. You never have any psychology. OK, no psychology- But my fantasy isn't getting tarted up as a bird. Thank you. What's that? It's not coke. Not coke? What is it? - A Vittel. - Coming up, darling. Have you seen two half-pints? One wearing a spider jacket. Vodka, please. A double. Dirty faggot, you said? Not again. What do you mean, poof! That's out of date. - I didn't say that. - Yes, sir, you said poof. Yes, excuse me. We say gay. We are the gay people. Isn't that right? Seen his stone? - Know how much he paid? - 515,000. - It's fake. - You know diamonds? Disappear, queer? He said that? - He said "disappear, queer." - I didn't. We don't say that either. "You won the Tour de France", "if my aunt had balls", it's over, it's old hat. - What! Queer as a rucksack! - Why a rucksack? - A rucksack... - I'll explain. Very refined, as my brother-in-law would say. That's enough! Help! He called us queers. Could you unblock the toilet? No. Now you can. That's not nice, he shouldn't do that. He went that way. Throw him out. There! - Queer. - Back inside, girls. No papers, nothing. Not even a ticket. He must have a bloody name. Moses, look what I found. Shit! Hello? I want my powder and my car. You have two hours. At 6 o'clock, I'll send an ear, at 7, two fingers... Wait! I'll tell you the truth. - The powder... - You'll get it. Don't touch the girl. We'll bring the car and the powder. - Where is it? - You had it. We left it back there. So what? Do we give them diamond powder? It's all over, they'll just kill her! What's the matter with you? The Lord has abandoned me. - I wanted that girl. - But you did nothing. I swear I tried not to look, or touch. - I used an ironing board. - Ironing board? But I sinned. He punished me by my sin. I wanted to cheat on my wife. Me. God tests those he loves. You know what you can do? What you know. I can't do a thing. You can. Pray to God. That's your thing. I brought you the car. And my powder? I don't have it. But I have money. I withdrew it all from the bank. 28,649 francs. I've also brought my wife's jewellery. Cultured pearls. That's 18-carat gold. It's worth... 300 grand? Your powder was lost on the first day. My brother sold it to Renault for 7000 francs. You're chasing diamond powder. Similar but worthless. You can kill us all but it won't bring back the dope. - Your brother's not smart. - You know who he is? People travel 5000 km to ask him a question. He has more memory than all the elephants in Africa. My brother is so pure - how can I put it? - that the whitest doves are whores next to him. He has his head in the clouds, awaiting the Messiah. He believes that one day, all men will be good. One day, you won't be shit. One day, a piece of scum like you, who sells drugs to children, might become a good person, he thinks. He's a rabbi, Malika. He's married. He couldn't love you. I'm deeply moved. You think I'm dumb? 28,000 francs, 3 bracelets, some Hollywood sermonizing... You really think I'm dumb! Men downstairs, women upstairs. Frangois-Camille! Bijou, what are you doing here? Not Bijou. Delaroche, drug squad. Come on, quickly. We'll get the girl. - Look. - It's diamond powder. 3 kilos of cocaine. 100% pure. It belongs to the police. Get in. You'll get your girlfriend and I'll get the best arrest of my career. My car! My bike! Awfully sorry, my brakes are dodgy. Slag! Cow! Here's the dope. Thanks, Mr Rabbi. God said: "I pursue mine enemies "and reduce them to powder." 3 kilos of cocaine, 100% pure. Your knife. Taste. Well? Is it OK? So? - So what? - So we share. - No we don't. - You don't want to? You want it all? Then you'll get it. Stick him, Goliath. And David took a stone... He threw it with his slingshot and hit Goliath and buried the stone in his forehead. Goliath! Hands up! Freeze! - Take them away. - Come on. Good girl, Louise. See, the old birds don't do that badly. You, just come quietly. Moses! Your clothes. Don't forget the diamond powder. There's 7000 francs-worth. Farewell, Moses. Your wife's jewellery. - Is Goliath here? - No, he's... Is that the powder? Yes, that's the powder. For Goliath. Hey! Wait! It's not cocaine, it's... Worthless! Come back! - You'd keep it? - Yes. It's dirty money! What about my bistrot? Who's going to pay for that? Nobody gives a damn. Not the insurance, nobody! - It's immoral. - You're a pain. So are you. You want to know? You were crappy earlier. See the guy in his fur? That looks good, that's classy. You looked like a thug. I was ashamed. Thief, crook. In the Bible, it says: "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's ass." Just drop the ass part! They'll find us, it'll begin again. They'll never find us. Subtitles: Henry Moon Subtitling: ECLAIR
