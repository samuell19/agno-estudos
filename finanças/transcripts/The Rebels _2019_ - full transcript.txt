Hello, beautiful ladies. Come gather here. I see your admiring glances. Do not be shy, I will not bite unless you want it. I have the finest products from the most remote places in the Roman Empire. Do you fish? From Germania. The grapes are from Gaul. How fresh they are is a matter of taste. - We do not care about it, Col. - You must. - I can not. - Do not spoil it here, okay? - We stick to the plan. - What are you talking about? - We're going to hurt the Romans where it hurts. - We pallets of apples. - We disrupt their food supplies. - Exactly. Apples. It's not about the apples, Julian. Without ... what they represent. They symbolize the decadence, the oppressor bosom. You have to start small, Jules. How overthrow an empire? I know. Stone by stone. - Excuse me. - Can I help you, my heart? It can actually. Can you talk about your wonderful grapes? The grapes? These grapes from Gaul is the best you can get. - Smell. - Do I smell them? - Very fine grapes. - I can not do it. What a rebel you are. Roman scum is all you will be. Watch and learn. - Did you touch just as we my chest? - There's nothing to grab anyway. Stop, you little shit! I know your father. Move! - Move! It was your fault! - What do you sell anyway? I think I'll take you! You almost ruined everything. I did not do it from the beginning. My father would kill me if we got caught. You get to talk to him next time. I do it better than you. - Can I get my apple? - Earn it. - I'll take just one. - Then I beat you. - What was the point of that? - We plunge Empire. Do you know what they do to thieves, your selfish little pig? They cut off the hand of you. Then you are completely useless to me. Dad! Take this, please. Sit down. Col. You might want to keep a low profile for a while. - Never mind the rebel thing ... for a while. - Are you serious? - Do you think he's right? - No, but I do not think you understand. It is not only you who ... Listen. You must be more careful. Stop being such a fucking pussy. What are you looking at? Do you think you're better than us? - You should probably draw. - What will you do? - Go away, boys. - You protect them seriously? What is your problem? - Do any time. - Colin. Colin! Forget it. Well, guys ... - Are you okay, Jules? - Yes, it is quiet. - You have to stand up for himself. - Busy day, guys? And, grandpa. - Terrible fish in that river? - Yes, they fought hard. Any luck? Stay away from trouble. See you at home. What happened to your face? It is shattered! There are those boys again. They have a bad influence on her. This conversation again? Can we just ignore it? - You have ... - It's okay. Yes it is. What a man of self-respect would marry you? - I do not know. Who did you have in mind? - Sickening. - Thanks. - Your sister would never come home then. And look at her now. - She married into a respectable family. - It cost some, but ... Cathy is a bitch, mother. She is a bad person. And you follow in her tracks. When will you give us a grandchild? What are you doing? We are not Romans. - And we try not to be. - All bullshit that will be respected. - Think of the language. - That's just crap. I've had enough of this. I am so tired of this place. It is a rubbish heap. My parents will not let marriage talk. I'll get out of here as fast as I can. So are you saying? - Where are you going? - Connect me to the uprising. - So you're going to kill some Romans? - Exactly. I'll take me to Rome ... ... and find that idiot Augustus and fix him. You should go with. - There's enough here. - And it has come more recently. - It was certainly someone Massacre north. - Dad said it was bullshit. Only people who spread rumors. So, who is with Rome? - I can actually imagine. - I have too much to do. What did your parents say? I should not socialize much with you. With me? You are not exactly marry material. - Have they seen me? - Apparently. - They'll miss me when I'm gone. - Our lives are here, Col. - Not mine. No detain me. - Cheers to that. You know what I mean. Damn it! Quick, let's go! Hurry up! Stay! Who of you cast it? What are you doing here? - What the hell did you do that? - What will you do about it? - Colin, shut up. We apologize. - Not me. He should not even be here. - What did you say? - Be careful with that. Do not tell me what to do, man. - So you think you're tough? - Come on, you make it worse. - We do not want trouble. - Or maybe I want it. - Shut up. - Can not we just stop, please? I know who you are. You are Dases bastard. - Leave him alone. - He probably would not like it here. I do not think he would be so happy if he knew you left your post. Or that you're an asshole, but he knows enough already. Be careful with your words, son. - So you're a tough guy? - Colin, stop. Is it your whore? Call her not. - Okay, honey. - Stop, please. I'm no one's whore. Why we do not change it? I pretend this never happened. No need to find out something. You can also get a taste when I'm done. - Let me see your feet. - What? Take off your boots. I'm going to have fun with you. - What the hell did you do that for? - Are you okay? - Yes, it is quiet. - Are you all right, mate? Buddy? - Are you okay? - Damn, he's dead! - Are you sure? No, he can not be. - Col, what have you done? Why did you do that? You did not have to kill him. - I have to go home. - Home? We must get out of here. - What are you talking about? - They will kill us. - Dad can help us. - No one can help us. We go back first and then ... Stop, it's not my fault. Okay, we go back and get so much stuff we can- -and pull away immediately. - Like, we gotta go. - No, I can not draw. - Where will we go? - I do not know. From here, anyway. Okay, help me. - Want to buy a chicken from me? - No it is good. - Buy one of my chickens. Come on. - Go to hell! Let's go. Where are the others? - What's that? - Dad's sword. He gets mad. No, it's quiet enough. Where the hell is Anika? - Okay. - Then we draw. Maybe we should stay away from the roads. For safety's sake. Does anyone know where we're going? We need to get on a plane. We must draw around the countryside and loot and stuff. What the hell is wrong with you? We killed just anyone. This is serious. Stop messing around. - Do you think we can ever return? - I do not care. They may not know that it was us. No, maybe not. We spend the night here. And... We should light a fire, I'm freezing. - Not tonight. It's too dangerous. - Dangerous? People can look after us. - What's that? - What then? - On my back. Do you have a position? - What? What are you talking about? I also have it. I'll show you mine if you show me yours. Can not you go somewhere else and pee? Anywhere except here. That's disgusting. Well then. Who is ready to find a new home? Yeah, whatever. Why not? Hey. Come and look at this. This is the right schyst. Tack. - Good? - It was actually. This is the last food we have, so be sure to appreciate it. - I'm glad you're all here. - Yes. - We had no choice. - No but... ... now we can do something. What we want to. Country living without the responsibilities. No fucking Romans. Just us together. Are you saying that we are going to stay here? For good? Yes, I mean. It takes a little work, but we can have a good life here. - Do you remember the swing? - Yes. - With a big case at the bottom. - And I had no fucking idea. - You fell and hurt your leg. - Yes, you left me there. No, not you. You stayed. But you drew. - It was lousy. - We would fix food. - It took a hell of time. - But it was fun. - You did you not at all. - Yes, we did. It has grown back there now. - What the hell was that? - a mating call. I want to attract one. - So you can fuck it. - There's nothing better to fuck this. Okay. Tell me how it goes. - Okay then. You can look up the food. - I will fix it. - Looks good. What is it? - A throwing stick. So to make ends thicker than the center. So when you throw it flies away. And get a Roman one in the head, he dies. But it looks like shit, huh? Lite. That's fine. I hunted with my girlfriend here before. - I'm good at tracking. - Oh really? - So what are you doing now? - Waiting. Yep. Here we have it. If you drive us? - Do you think we did the right thing? - What? That we gave of ourselves. Yes, I mean ... We did not direct any choice. I want to believe that it's true. - Are you okay? - Yes, it is quiet. I'm really hungry just. Bloody rats. Everything good, guys? So ... while you were chasing rats I got was a gift. Cheeky bastard. What is that? - You're joking. - What is that? Druids use them to speak to the gods. - Col, we've barely eaten. - How? I do not know, but we'll find out. - I have a few questions I want to ask. - Then maybe we should do it. It is not for us. It is not intended that we should talk to them. Why not? What makes Druids so special? This is crazy. Certainly. So how do we do? Okay, I'm not entirely sure, but I guess ... So when we hear of the gods? I do not know, but you talk to them so you can well put in a good word for me. I do not know... I want you. I've come here himself. - What happened? - Are you kidding me? - No. - You started chopping at the tree there. I could not stop you. You could destroy the house. And Anika slept there. Yes, but nothing happened and she's okay. - Is not it? - That's not the point. - Take it easy. - Take it easy? - Yes, it's quiet. - No, Colin. We have nothing to eat. - No success? - No nothing. - You need to take this seriously. - What have we been doing? - You only larvat you all the time. - It is unfair. And what have you done? - It was not schyst. - Go to hell. So... Last night. You know. - Continue. - You and I. - Let's make it happen. - What? Come on, play no games. I want you to like it. It'll be fine. And then, turn like this. And put it over these two. Turn. No, you do one at a time. Su has to do it in pairs. No, now twisted too much. And then you keep this. And again. - I did after that. - No, you did just one side. You rotate like this. No, together. We have been silent for too long. We have to do something. I like being here. - You know the other day when we ate the mushrooms. - Yes? I believe that the gods told me to fuck Anika. What? I can not really explain, but ... ... she was foaming and I just felt it. I do not know. - It can make things more complicated. - Yes maybe. Do you think she ... you know. Holy shit! - They may be looking for us. - It was an army. - It would be crazy if they were looking for us. - But we have to be more careful. - Why do you think they come from? - It must have happened something serious. - Now we have the chance to do something. - Do not be stupid. Are you going to kill all of them with a stick? - We have been passive for too long. - It just means more trouble. Never mind. Certainly. Then I do it myself. - I worry about Colin. - He can handle himself. He is not stupid, Anika. We must be more careful. - He will find out otherwise. - He has not come to me yet. - But he said something weird the other day. - What? - Do not worry. - I'm serious. It does not matter. Jules? Are you okay? Yes, it's okay. - It's a little dicey only. - Oh really? Get up, kid. I'll handle this. - It's a boy from my village. - We should take him to camp. You can return. I will later. This is mine. - What the hell are you doing here? - What the hell are you doing here? - Do not be so cocky, kid. - You do not tell me what to do. - Where is my son? - Julian's okay. You idiot. You know what you've done? When you killed that soldier will your people be punished. They rebelled. And now we have to stop it. You would not even have been here from the beginning. This is not your country. Do you think I wanted to come here? I came here because I was ordered. The judge ... ... want to see you dead. All four. To set an example. How do they know it was us? For you carved your name in the guard tower. Now, get the others and get out of here. Thanks to my son, you get a chance. Ta den. You guys! It has begun. The uprising. - What? Why? - Our village is fighting back. - Why are you smiling? - It's the beginning. What the hell is wrong with you? You have started a war. - What do you mean? We were there everyone. - But we did not kill Roman. So you just wanted to let him ... - Back me. - If you kept silent ... - It's not true. - We can never return home now. We have everything we need here. Was not that the point? But it is anyway your fault. All is well? Do not be such a pussy. What is this? What are you doing? We hang out. - I just take care of you. - Takes care of me? - Bullshit. - Yes I do. - It's not necessary. - What? - Go to hell only. - No, you can do. There is no game. - I can not take responsibility for you. - Yes, and when you have done it? Dare not ... Dad never hit you as hard as me. I took a hundred kinds of you- - so do not tell me to fuck off. I had a life over there. Do not you do something? Fight back, I do. What's the point? It makes no difference. It only gets worse. Listen, Col. I'm sorry. But I do not want to be part of the planning. - You have deceived us. - Not a chance. What do you think our parents are doing right now? They try certainly still find a man to me. You should try it. Finding yourself a man. With fox's mating call. Do not worry. All is well? - They've been gone a long time. - Yes. They were gone when I woke up. Okay... What? Colin, all right? - Col. - What? I'm leaving. I intend to make a difference. - What are you talking about? Where are you going? - You do not want me here, so I draw. - Fad hell are you talking about? - What is it, Col.? Do not talk crap! I do not hear you! - Do not say that to me. - What's with you? - Did you think I would not notice? - What you talking about? You said I would not do anything when it gets complicated. - I heard you the other night. - We did not want to tell you, okay? - We knew you would ... - Do not lie to me! I do not lie! You are my best friend. You were that we felt sorry for you. Colin, stop. - You little bastard. You're pathetic. - Colin. Are you okay? What is it? I think I'm pregnant. What? Jules? - Has he gone away? - Yes. To hell with him. I do not follow after this time. He has taken its decision. Sorry I fled. I panicked. Idiot. How long have you known about it? For a while. When my sister was pregnant , it was the same. I'm not ready for this. - I do not want to be like my sister. - It will not be. What should I do with the children? We take care of it together. We can go to some nice place and ... You'll be a father, Jules. - You should not be here. - What will you do about it? - It is not like that. - How is it then? - What you did ... You started something. - But that's just me now. When you are given you by ... ... was the Roman soldiers to the village and began to interrogate ... - ... and take away people. - Who? - Where are my parents? - Did you see them? The soldiers would get your friend Anika's family. Your father tried to stop them. Your mother ... I'm not sure. She disappeared. - Where? - I do not know. - I do not know, I promise. - Where is she? You need to calm down. They're looking for you ... and your friends. I leave myself. Then maybe they will let them be. Do not be stupid. It is too late. Do not you know what you are? I do not care about that shit. I just... - I did not want them to die. - They torture you until you admit ... - ... and then they will kill you. - We have to. Now. You bastards! Wake. Col? Where have you been? You've been gone for days. - We must leave here. - What happens? I returned. The Romans are looking for us. They nearly got hold of me. - Brought you hit them? - I'm sorry. - It does not matter now. - Did you go back home? No, I did not come so far ... We'll talk about that later. We have to leave now. - Talk about what? - Sago, get up. - Colin, what are we talking about? - Nothing. We must leave here. Come now. He Sabbath for us again. - All is well? - Who are you? - I asked who you were. - No special. What do you want? I'm looking for a boy. He went this way. Who else is here? I live alone. - It's best that you do not lie to me. - It's no different here. - No longer. - Is he in there? Forgive me ... It's my fault. - We must do something. - Please forgive me... - I just want to go home. - I would never have brought you. No ... it was not your fault. - I would never have left you. - Forgive me. I will not leave you. - I'll stay here and take care of you. - I know. Col, I'm sorry, but we have to go now. - He said it himself. - I can not just leave him. We can not take him. - What should we do with him? - What if more show up? Do not be silly, Col. - We have to get out of here. - Colin, please ... He had not wanted to give up. Colin. We need to continue. They are dead. - Jules, what's he talking about? - Colin? Who is dead? My parents. They killed Anika's parents too. What? And my dad? - I do not know, Jules. - What do you mean by that? I saw them a few days ago. He and some other soldiers. He spoke to me and saved me. Then he disappeared. - Why did not you say anything? - I can not handle this. Anika. Anika! We need to continue. Try not to think about it. - Easy for you to say, my family is dead. - Easy? My dad's out there and I do not know if he is alive. We must leave. Now. Duck! Holy shit that is. Schyst. Come on! Come on! Stay here. Okay... You did good from you. - It was crazy. - You killed enough, the last soldier. - Col? I'm sorry ... - No. I'm sorry. I should not have given me by. - It's not your fault. - Yes it is. All. - No, we are all involved. - But you should not be. If I just kept shut , none of this happened. - All those died because of me. - Do not be so bloody stupid. - It would have happened regardless. - Stop protecting me. I must do something about it. - What should you do? - I will lead them away or something. - You must leave here. - It is unfair to just ask us pull. It's not about what's fair. It's my problem. Please ... We will not leave you. They will not stop. You're doing not otherwise. - No one else will die because of me. - Please ... You do not do it. Follow us only. Get out now. I'll find you. You're a tough bastard. I admit it. That I was not expecting. You killed two Roman soldiers. - Imposing a boy. - I'm not a boy. Men do not flee. Sin. You had been a good soldier.
