[epic music playing] [♪♪♪] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Natalie Rogers, events planning. Yes, Mrs. Miller. I confirmed the venue this morning. You're all set for your Christmas party. Natalie Rogers, travel consultant. Hey, Mr. Walker, how were your flights? I'm so glad. Yeah, you know, you can always string some lights around a palm tree and call it Christmas. Natalie Rogers, custom gift-wrapping. Yes, I will be dropping those off in about 15 minutes. Mr. Ortiz! I finished the wreath for your food truck. Even if the weather is frightful, the chilies will keep you warm. Look. Muchas gracias. Wendy! Oh! Christmas cards, addressed and stamped. Oh, I... Pop them in the mail and the let the mailman do the rest. Thank you so much, they're beautiful. Oh, I love hand-addressed cards, but with my penmanship no one would get them until July. Well, I threw in a couple of extra for Joshy and Becca direct from the North Pole. They'll be thrilled. Thank you so much. You're welcome. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, Wendy. Yeah, took a little creativity but you know I love a challenge. Merry Christmas. Natalie, Sparky would be so glad to see you. Come here. Sparky, your favorite sitter is here. Hello, handsome. And these clothes. Who doesn't love to get all dressed up for the holidays? We want to take him on a Christmas cruise, but he gets terrible sea-sickness. Well, I am happy to. We are gonna have a great time! We're gonna watch It's a Wonderful Woof, and lap up eggnog, and sing Christmas carols. [dog barks] See, he already knows the opening to Jingle Bells. You're the best pet-sitter anywhere we've ever had. [Natalie] Thank you. [Girl's mom] Natalie, thank you so much for doing this. Of course. Are you sure I can't convince you to come work for me? Thank you, but I already have a job. You have eight jobs. That was just the last time I counted. May have added one or two since then. But why can't I since I'm the Jacklyn of all trades. When are you gonna settle down on one career? I don't know, but I figure when I find the perfect thing, I'll know it. And until then I'm happy as I am. Well, I hope you're not still waiting on the perfect thing to do for Christmas. Thank you, but I'm gonna spend Christmas with my cousin Olivia. I should probably get going. Miles to go before I sleep or at least a few more blocks. [chuckles] Be a good doggie, okay. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Let's go, Sparky. Bye, Sparky. Bye. [phone ringing] Natalie Rogers, custom wreaths or um, travel consultant. [Olivia] Hi, it's Olivia. Olivia. I was just talking about you. Are you back from Rome yet? [Olivia] No, I am not back from Rome. Uh, I guess you haven't been following the news, have you? It's the big chill, the new Ice Age. What are you talking about? I'm stranded here. Oh no. Yeah, looks like I won't be home for Christmas, I'm so sorry. It's okay, it's um I'll miss you, but don't worry about me, lots of friends have offered to spend their Christmases with me. [sighs] But are you okay? Yeah, but I wanted to kinda keep this as a surprise, you know how I've been wanting to open my restaurant for years. Well, I finally convinced Chef Grimaldi to come over to Pine Valley and be my partner. I remember him from when you took me to Italy when I was little girl. I always thought he looked just like Santa Claus. Oh, uh, so my plan was to open on Christmas Eve with a big traditional feast of Natale. You know how it is in small towns, nothing is ever open on Christmas and there's always a few people with no place to go. No one should be alone on Christmas. [Olivia] Yeah, I feel terrible. We already had a handful of reservations I'm gonna have to cancel, there's no way Chef Grimaldi can do it on his own. Oh, I'm so sorry. Yeah, me too. Well, I wanted to let you know, Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Olivia. [sighs] Problems are just opportunities in work clothes. Hi, Mrs. Myers. This is Natalie Rogers, Olivia's cousin. I have an idea. What do you know about this restaurant she's planning on opening? [sighs] Come here. Come on. Alright. [sighs] Olivia always was an optimist. Chef Rivaldi? You stay here. All dogs might go to heaven but they should probably stay out of restaurant kitchens. Stop right there, you Ow! [speaking Italian] No, don't, let me go! [speaking Italian] Oh, that's so much better. Are you hurt? What? Are you hurt? No, no. No. II think it's fine. Now get outta my kitchen, presto. Your kitchen, this is my cousin Olivia's kitchen. So Olivia has a cousin? And the restaurant may be hers, but the kitchen always belongs to the chef. You can't be Chef Grimaldi. You're nothing like Santa Claus. [laughs] Oh, you're thinking of my uncle, Zio Lorenzo Grimaldi. Maybe I just look like my [speaks Italian]. But he was too old to come to America, so I came instead. Sorry, I'm his nephew Stefano Grimaldi. Ow. Uh, sorry. Uh, I don't know the name of you. I'm Natalie. Rogers. Olivia's cousin. Oh, I should've known. See Olivia told me her cousin was [inhales] la bella signorina. [chuckles] Oh, that's very nice of her. [sniffles] Oh, and it's very true. But what were you doing uh, sneaking around my kitchen? I wasn't sneaking. Then that's not the word for it, the sneaking and creeping. No, I wasn't doing any of those thing, I was just looking for the chef. [Mrs. Myers] Yoohoo! Is anybody here? Mrs. Myers. Thanks for coming. Have you met my cousin's best friend? - Hi. - This is Mrs. Anna Myers. Stefano! [speaks in Italian] Oh, I see you have. And another one. What third time's not a charm? Stefano's quite charming enough. And who is this? [Natalie] Sparky. I'm pet-sitting for the holidays. Well, it was nice to see you, huh. And to meet you, Sparky. But I must go otherwise my sauce, huh, it will burn if I don't get back. - Oh, I just need to talk to you. - No! A chef will never let his food burn. Not for anything. Mamma mia. [Natalie] Well, fine then. I brought your cousin's spare keys, I'm sure she won't mind if you stay in her house while you're here in town. Thank you. I really wanna go through with the grand opening just as planned. [sighs] Well, there's a lot of work to be done. Every problem is an opportunity in disguise. If you insist. Well, let's get you settled in and I'll tell you what I know of her plans. Unless I was interrupting something. What? No. He's a very handsome man. He's a very grumpy man. He yelled at me in Italian. And he doesn't even look like Santa Claus. [sighs] What a cute store. I know, lovely. So nice. You know, Olivia asked me to cancel all of the Christmas reservations but if you're really serious You bet I'm serious. Olivia didn't wanna let anyone down on Christmas and neither do I. Beebee, hello! Hi, Mrs. Myers. Beebee's one of my students. This is my good friend's cousin, Natalie. How are you doing, Beebee? Uh, not's so good. I was hoping to get some temp work in over vacation, but it seems like everyone in town has already hired the holiday help. Too bad. I'll keep an ear around. Thanks, Mrs. Myers. It was nice to meet you, Ms. Natalie. Oh, there's someone you should know, Miles Croaker, he's out town culture vulture. [Natalie] Culture vulture? You know, he oversees all the town events, concerts and reviews everything from the high school musical to the local restaurants for the paper. Restaurant reviews, huh. He's tough, but fair and very well-respected. He can make it work for anyone in this town. [Miles] Phew. Miles, dear, what's the matter? I haven't seen you this distraught since the fizzing fireworks fiasco of '09. Oh, it's this Roman snow-blow. Oh, the blizzard that hit Rome. Yeah, my cousin's stuck there for Christmas. Oh, this storm's has wreaked havoc on air travel all over the world. And in in Christmas. Oh, our touring carolers just heard that flights home are canceled and can't be rescheduled until after the holiday. It's terrible to be away from home on Christmas. Hmm, yes, I was hoping they'd be able to celebrate in the café, it's closed on Christmas. Are most places closed then? Yes, all of them. Our poor carolers aren't just stranded without their loved ones, but must also eat microwave turkey dinners. Ew. [Miles] Mm-mm. Can you please excuse me I must call my travel agents again and see if there's anything they can do. Those poor carolers. I don't suppose you can do anything for their travel agent front? I already tried for my cousin Olivia, everything's locked up. [Natalie sighs] [Natalie] It looks so beautiful. [Mrs. Myers chuckles] You know Olivia, she always has to set up her decorations right after Thanksgiving that way Christmas can last as long as possible. [laughing] [sighs] You know she'd be here if she could. Yeah. I know. I just can't remember the last time I celebrated Christmas without her. [sighs] Oh, do you wanna stay for dinner? Of course. I'm sure you can find something in the freezer to cook. [chuckles] Cook? You did just wanna have a grand restaurant opening, right? [laughs] Yeah, I just didn't think I would be the one cooking. I better take this. Go ahead, make yourself at home. Hey. I know. [sighs] Lasagne. Dishwasher, this is the oven? I tried that one. Okay. Back to planning Pezzo Di Parma. Who could that be? - Stefano. - Ciao, Natalie. Uh, I made a sauce but uh, now there is no one to eat it, so I thought maybe if you don't have any plans for dinner, you can have. And some bone for the cagnolino. Doggie bag for the doggie that's very thoughtful, thank you. Prego. Oh, do you wanna come in and join us for dinner? There's gotta be plenty. Are you sure? Yeah, I was just making a lasa... [smoke alarm beeping] Oh no, the lasagne. Oh. Ooh, no! [coughing] [Natalie screams] Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry. [speaking Italian] What are you what is going on here? I was just thawing the lasagne and then I got uh, distracted researching for the grand opening and I guess I just forgot. Forgot? Forgot. Do you forget to breathe? Does your heart forget to pump? How can you be cooking and forget? I'm not much of a cook. But I found so many wonderful ideas, I didn't realize how elaborate the feast of Natale is. There's a beautiful celebration and everybody comes together for a big Christmas meal that lasts for hours and hours with um, antipasto, and salad, and meats, and sweetbreads. Mhmm. And candied nuts, and wine, music. I thought we could decorate the whole place like a Tuscan villa but with Christmas touches like a Mm. [Mrs. Myers] Looks like Mmm. Your mystery pasta worked its magic again. [chuckles] It's so [grunts] There's parsley and oregano. What else? It will be la specialità Italia de casa when we finally open Pezzo Di Parma. If we ever open. Madame. Of course, you're gonna open. And just in time. Just in time for Christmas. What? Yeah, like you and Olivia planned. No, it's impossible. We have three days until Christmas, we we-we we have nothing prepared, we have no staff, no no decoration. No food prepared, it's impossible. No, I have a lot of really good ideas, if I Stefano's right, Natalie. It's a lovely idea, but we don't have enough time to get it done. - It's okay. - Maybe you're right. Is it coriander? Fennel? Oh, come on, you have to tell me. If I tell you, it will not be a mystery sauce anymore, right? Mhmm. But please. Turmeric? Paprika? Na Natalie, the thing to guess is the a little bit in the cook. Unlike your lasagne. Capito. [Stefano] Natalie, good morning. Morning. I fancy you're gonna need our reservation book? I better get started on those cancellations. Hmm. Mr. Croaker, good morning! Well, good morning. I heard a rumor that your cousin's restaurant might be open for Christmas and I thought I'd come to see for myself. I'm afraid that's just a rumor. Oh, well, worth a try. [laughs] Oh, uh, sorry, my dear. This is Ariella Cancio, one of our touring carolers. - Hello. - Buongiorno. [speaking Italian] Oh uh, I'm so sorry, I forget my manners. Um, I was just saying it is sad this year, so many of us have nowhere to go but um, meeting someone from the same part of Italia it's a little bit of home. I'm afraid it is sad, but uh, there's no way around it. - Uh, sorry, we don't... - Yes, there is. Just a tiny change of plans. Mr. Croaker, Ristorante Pezzo Di Parma would be proud to host you and all of the carolers for a big traditional feast of Natale dinner on Christmas. [Miles] Oh, well, thank you. [Arielle] Grazie mille. [laughing] - Ci vediamo. - Ci vediamo. Are you kidding? Or do you wanna make the pasta? Do you wanna make the pizza? What are you gonna do, huh? Pazza. Pazzo. Oh, but I can help. Oh my God! [Natalie] It's gonna be fine. [indiscernible speech] Woman make me crazy, eh. Tried to tell you it's impossible, but you don't listen, huh. [pots and pans clattering] Well? Impossibile, impossibile. There's always a way. No, it will be a fiasco. And that is... It's the same word in English and it will not be a fiasco, there is always a way. Sometime there is no... There is no way. Sometime there is a wall, there's just a big wall and no ladder, capisce? Big wall or small, the best way to get over it is to start climbing. [chuckles] Maybe you are crazy. If we can pull this off your mystery sauce alone is worth a five-star review. [Stefano sighs] Reviews are important. Many, many restaurant in America they fail because of it, I understand. But I thought, I thought I would have more time to plan, to make everything perfect. It will be perfect. And it will be a beautiful feast of Natale for a bunch of people that have nowhere else to go. [sighs] I will get my recipes. - Plan the menu. - Great. What should I do? You? You look for a rope. Even if can get up that wall, Natalie, we still need a way down. [Natalie] Okay, read me the list again. [Beebee] Décor, so all this. Food. Oh, that's Stefano's department. Believe me, you do not want me doing the cooking. Menus. I can do those. Beautiful handwritten menus will be great, right? Yeah. Staffing. Staffing. Well, we aren't gonna have a formal service for just five, but we're definitely gonna need some help now even going family style. Who do you think we can get this close to Christmas? Well, there's this guy in my class. Tyler. But I don't know him that well. Oh, then what makes you think... Well, his cousin Melissa told me that his folks were going out of town, he was supposed to join them once school was out, but then I heard from Joanna that all the flights were canceled due to the snowstorm in Italy. And last year he was helping stock shelves at the hardware store, but then I heard from Carol that he didn't take the job this year, 'cause he didn't think he'd be around. But you don't know him very well? Not really. This Tyler, he's um pretty cute, huh? Yeah. I mean I guess, I never really paid attention all that much. Does he have curly brown hair? Mhmm, I mean I... I don't know him that well. And warm puppy dog eyes? Yeah. How did you know that? Um, because there's a cute boy with curly brown hair over there pretending not to notice you for the last 10 minutes. Where? What, no, no don't don't point. [Beebee sighs] Please tell me he didn't see me. I think he sounds like a great candidate. Why don't you go offer him the job? I can't do that. You should be the one to do that. As my assistant, I'm delegating my task to you. No, but I wouldn't even know what to say. You'll be fine, go on, I'll help you. - Please, no. - I'll help you. Tyler! Hi, it's Beebee. Jordan. From school. You know? Oh, Beebee, hi, uh. Yo, what's uh, what's up? I'm so sorry, uh. What's up? Not much. How are you? I'm cool. - What's that? - No. Just some reindeer went by, you know, no big deal. Reindeer, right. Oh, I was wondering if you wanted a job for the holidays? [chuckling] You'd be working with me. Not every second. Just sometimes. Only when we had to. Uh, well, schp sch sure. Yeah, that'd be cool. - What's the - [Beebee] Cool. What's the job? What is it? - Miming. - Miming, uh, I I I don't... Serving food in a restaurant. That yes, that I can do. Yeah. Good, 'cause there's also... drumming. Um. Cooking! Cooking, helping cook in the kitchen. I like to cook. - Good. - Yeah. 'Cause there also might be... You know what, here's my boss Ms. Natalie right now. Hey, Tyler. Hi. Beebee's told me a lot about you even though she doesn't know you very well. Uh. I think if you're interested in the job, you'd be a great fit. It sounds great. [Natalie] Great um, why don't you head on over to Pezzo Di Parma, I'll let Stefano know you're on your way. Thanks, Ms. Natalie, uh thank you. Um, thanks Beebee. I'll uh, I'll see you later. [laughs] [Stefano] Andiamo, Tyler. Dry storage and cold storage, prepping area. Prepping area. Hot line, cold line, plating area. - Capito? - Yeah. Love, life, and cooking is all the same. It's logical. I'm looking at your face and I see you don't understand. Uh, no, no, I get that cooking has to be logical, but love? Okay, I will use myself as an example. Tyler, I already know the woman I will fall in love with. How can you know that? Logic. I know it will be someone who will help me raise our children to speak Italian, who wants to live where I live, and love cooking as much as I do. So we can share our second passion, pasta. Okay, but what about you know, attraction? Ah, you want a bella signorina, of course. [Tyler chuckling] But not every bella signorina is the right bella signorina for you. That why you need logic. Wow, I haven't even thought about what I want. [Natalie] Hello? Ah. We're back. We brought enough stuff to deck the halls. [Stefano] Oi. Not to mention the dining room. [indiscernible speech] and even you. Hmm, that smells delicious. And we are starving. Good. Then you must eat, it's almost finished. Is that the mystery sauce? Ah. Did you see what he put in it? [Stefano clicking tongue] Oh, there was some... There was some green stuff, and some chopped stuff, and uh, some other stuff. Maybe if I eat out of the pan, I'll get the mystery ingredient. Nah! Scusi. Hmm. Little bit sweet and a little bit tangy and just a tiny bit bitter, but in a good way like Si. Ginger. The mystery ingredient is ginger, right? Tell me I'm right. Or maybe thyme. If I told you It wouldn't be a mystery. What? It doesn't have thyme, but it needs it, right? [speaking Italian] How could you give me advice on the pompieri, the firefighter, they must put the boots on when they are coming over, hmm? Okay, okay. I'm cooking-challenged. But when I was a little girl, Olivia used to make me taste everything that she went along. Oh. I actually have a pretty good palate. This is delicious. It would be better if I had Olio d'oliva descadoni. It's an olive oil we make in Parma next to where I come from. I looked for it everywhere, I cannot find it. Ah, ah, ah, ah. Mamma mia. Basta. I still think the mystery ingredient is ginger. Turmeric! I don't know much about kitchens, but I know that's not good. And the plumbing is old here, it needs an expert touch. [grunting] Oh God! Oh God, oh. Expert, huh? Here let me. [Stefano sighs] [coughing] [sighs] It's probably just one little pipe. Tyler, Beebee, go check the washroom. Everything's gonna be fine. It can't be all the plumbing. Why not? Um, because it's Christmas. No water in the ladies room. Or the men's. [speaking Italian] We cannot open a restaurant without running water. Problems are just opportunities in disguise. No, basta. The feast of Natale is off. [sighs] [Natalie] Any chance they'll finish before Christmas? Okay, thank you, yeah. Yeah, Merry Christmas. Come on, we got this. This is just a chance to show our awesomeness. And we are pretty dang awesome. Am I right? [Mrs. Myers] Hello! I brought that tree skirt you wanted. Do you know you still have lasagne on the back stoop? Uh, thank you. I'm waiting until spring, so I can give it a proper burial. You're the only person I know that uses a smoke alarm instead of an egg timer. [chuckling] Well, good thing we have Chef Stefano. Very good. Actually I was wondering if I could scrounge an invitation to the festive feast, if you have room. Of course, you are more than welcome to join us. Thank you, that pasta the other day, it may mean that handsome is as handsome does, but that handsome des very well in the kitchen. [laughing] So you finally noticed, huh? Yeah, in the kitchen. Mrs. Myers, you are terrible. Besides, I think he's interested in Ariella, that caroler from Italy. They seem to have a lot in common. Oh. And once Olivia comes back, I'm gonna go back to the city. That's 23 for dinner. We invited the Serena Carolers and Miles Croaker too, of course. Are you sure that's a good idea? Yeah, one taste of Stefano's mystery sauce and he is sure to give a rave review. Miles Croaker has never given any restaurant a rave review. Ever. Oh. The last restaurant he banned, well... What? Closed within a couple of months. [exhales] So what you're saying is if we fail, we risk totally destroying Olivia's dream. I'm afraid so. [sighs] Birds are out in full force. Really glad you agreed we need to have a Christmas tree. Yeah, we have Christmas tree in Italy, too, you know? I know. I saw the Pinterest. And this is it, uh, this is our tree. I don't know. I do know. The correct height, uh, the correct amount around. And the correct amount of branches. There's a correct number of branches? Yes. Not so many, there's not enough space for decoration, but enough space uh, to be like, [speaks Italian] to be Bushy. Natalie, it's a tree not a bush. Just doesn't feel right. Feel? What does feel have to do with this? It's all about logic like life, uh cooking, like love. [laughs] Life is not about logic, it's about oh, what about this one? Oh, why this one? I don't know, my instincts just tell me, this is the right tree. Yeah, I think your instinct uh, mistaken. My instincts are never wrong. Huh? Is that right? Oh. Oh, hmm. Wait, did you just say you think you can rely on logic for love? Of course. What else? Instincts. Intuition. That little voice inside you that says you're at the perfect place at the perfect time. And when that has happened to you? Well, it hasn't happened. Not yet. But it will. [laughing] What, it's not like logic's really worked out so well for you either. It's it's really hard to see under here. Um, well, let me get some lights, maybe that'll help. [screaming] Um Tyler, Tyler! Oh Tyler, are you okay? Tyler, are you okay? Tyler, are you hurt? Are you all chopped up like potato peelings? Are you hurt? Are you chopped up like No, but I might be deaf from here on out. If you heard me ask the question, how can you be deaf? What was that? What was that what was that ringing? Nevermind the ringing, what about the plumbing? Huh, what? What? What drumming? Plumbing, not drumming. Oh, right. Look, um, I'm sorry, Beebee, I can't do this. Tell Ms. Natalie I tried but I guess they're gonna have to cancel the feast of Natale. I'm sorry, alright? Okay, hold on. You can't give up. Don't you see this is a chance to prove your awesomeness. Awesomeness, I I don't even know if I have any awesomeness. Well, here's your chance to find out. It's time to prove your awesomeness, Tyler. You can do this. Okay. Alright, you stand over there. Okay! Why? Because if I do find my awesomeness, I wanna make sure it doesn't get shredded in the garbage disposal. [laughs] [Tyler grunts] - No! - Yes! [grunts] - No. - Yes. What if your intuition never picks a logical tree? What if your logic never picks a tree that feels right? What if intuition is broken? What if your logic is just stupid? Have you thought about just buying two trees? Then you can both be right and happy. We do have room for it. I wanna have all day, so yes, thank you. Okay, two trees it is. Just call it when you see the one you want. - Okay, you too. - Okay. [Stefano clicks tongue] - Mine! - Mine! [both laugh] Natalie, hi, how are you? Hey, Olivia, um how's the Roman snow-blow? Yeah, it's still blowing. Oh. Oh, what's wrong? Did your plan for Christmas with your friends fall through? It uh, hasn't gone exactly according to plan. Um [speaking Italian] I actually kind of have a strange question for you. Do you know where I could get a bottle of Olio d'oliva descadoni. Well, that is a rare kind of olive oil. You are not gonna try to cook, are you? No. Um, I just thought it would make a nice gift for um, for a friend. Oh, you know, 'cause it's from Parma, the same region as Chef Grimaldi. Oh, I had no idea. Um, do you know where I can find it in the State? [Olivia] No, I do not know of any place outside of Italy, I'm so sorry. Oh. Well, that's okay. Thanks anyway, Olivia. Um, I have to go. I miss you. Merry Christmas. I miss you, too. Merry Christmas. [car beeps] Perfect. Keys please. Thanks. [Tyler] Let's have a go, moment of truth. So much for my awesomeness. No, Tyler, you've been great. You really have. I mean you know so much more than you thought you did. You think? You've been great too, Beebee. I never would've thought about checking with the city about the main line. Thanks. But Yeah. So I guess I'll I'll see you back at school in January. Yeah. January. Bye. Wait! Did we remember to turn the sink's off valve back on? [claps hands] Yes, yes! Alright, okay. [Tyler grunts] [sighs] Alright, here we go. - Yes! - Yes! Yes! Oh, yes! Just leave it there. [Stefano sighs] [Tyler and Beebee laughing] What is that? I think that's the sound of awesomeness. Awesomeness? [Tyler] Yes, oh yes! - Is that good? - [Natalie] It's very good. [laughing] Is there a plumber in the house? Oh, Ms. Natalie, Tyler got the water back on. Yeah, and Beebee helped, she was she was Awes awesomeness. Well, yeah. Good, then we start with the pasta. Sure, yeah, I'm ready to do anything. No Tyler, you better go home and shower not work in the kitchen, huh? Oh yeah, well, I guess yeah, I'm sort of Me too. Yeah, you've done enough for now. Natalie will help me with the pasta. Me? You do remember what happened the last time I tried to cook, right? [laughs] Don't worry, Natalie, you're not cooking. You're just making the tortellinis. I'll be the one cooking them. Oh, okay, great. In my country, Natalie, the children do this all the time. I mean at least a child, si. Si. I mean yes. Crack the egg into the flour. Whoops, too hard. - Uh, let me try - Si. Si, si, si, si, si. Another one. Okay, let me try that again. Bellissimo. Perfecto. Uh, now need to uh, beat the egg up like you making scrambled eggs, but incorporating the flour slowly. Like this. Oh, sure. You never made scrambled eggs? Yes, I have not. How have you not starved to death in that city of yours? Grabhub. The pizza delivery boy. Ai yai yai. You know, if everybody stayed home and cooked every night, nobody would need to go to a restaurant. The egg is getting away. Oh, ooh, hold on eggies, get back here. Back to your volcano. Don't you wanna be part of the best pasta the world's ever known. Good. Well, now the pasta is mixed, we need to knead it. It's a very good workout, my nonna, my grandmother, she had arms like a like a Schwarzenegger. Oh. I'm not really sure if that's a ringing endorsement or not. Ai, you have to lean into it, uh. Oh. You need to feel it changing under your hands. Feel it changing? [laughs] I feel something. [Ariella] Buongiorno, anyone here? Here! Uh yeah, we're over here. Ariella. Ciao bella. [kissing] [speaking Italian] The carolers and I just wanted to drop off po di vino. Not not for the feast of Natale of course, but uh, just an early grazie for everything you are doing for us. Prego. Very thoughtful of you, grazie. Yes, very, very thoughtful of all of the carolers. Please thank them for us. [speaking Italian] And uh, what's all this? Oh, you make pasta? I used to make pasta with mia nonna every Natale. It uh, it was my favorite part. But uh, I can help. Oh, you cook? Of course, I love to cook. But you're our guest, we couldn't possibly make you work in the kitchen. Make me, no, I want to. We'd love your help. Let me get you an apron. Andiamo. [Ariella] Okay. Great. [blows raspberry] [speaking Italian] Hmm. [speaking Italian] [sighs] They're waiting for us. Okay, I'm ready. Um, Chef Stefano. How'd you come with your logical list of qualities you're looking for in a woman? Well, I thought about it and she didn't make sense to me. Why what's the matter? Oh, nothing, nothing. I just I guess I just haven't done enough thinking. Andiamo. Baked brie with olive tabouli, minestrone reteta, ricotta and spinach tortellini, braised beef in Merlot wine sauce and something called, "Panettone". Sounds wonderful. But I'm afraid Stefano's multo-italiano menu isn't gonna trigger any warm American fuzzies. I make these really good cookie bars. Well, it's a start. I know, we can make a big batch of cookies and then take the tray into the town Christmas Cookie Swap this afternoon. Christmas Cookie Swap? This afternoon? Beebee, you just baked my day. [laughing] Ooh, but we're gonna have to hurry if we'll be ready on time. Come on. Just like shake some in. Oh! [Beebee groaning] Okay. All over. Everywhere. Oh, looks pretty great. Perfect. Good job. [Natalie] Alright, to the fridge. Now we just 30 minutes while it sets. You better set a timer, can't rely on a smoke alarm for this one. So I ordered all the place cards and the menu cards, I know you wanted to write them up by hand but until Chef Stefano finalizes the menu Ms. Natalie. It's like Olio d'oliva descadoni is some kind of... Ms. Natalie! Culinary food myth, like free-range foie gras or guilt-free ice cream. Ms. Natalie! Oh, I'm sorry, what? It's time. Hurry, we're gonna be late for the swap. Okay, go, go, go! [Natalie] Hats, coats, gloves, it's cold! The secret to a clean kitchen is simple, don't cook ever. Porca vacca! [Tyler] What, what, oh sorry, what happened? What? I can't see. [Tyler] Holy cow! That's what I said, eh, not exactly, but you get the idea. What happened? There's only one thing I can think of that can cause so much damage to a kitchen in so short of a time. Rabid badgers? Rabid badgers, Natalie! Oh yeah. Yeah, that make that makes sense. Well, look look at least the smoke alarm isn't going off yet. This feast of Natale is not gonna work. Why do you say that? Because we used up our Christmas miracle when Natalie didn't burn the whole place down. [sighs] Okay, are we late, did we make it on time? Uh no, we made it. Wooh. [indistinct chatter and laughter] There's free samples. Don't say it. That's because you're one smart cookie. [grunts] [Natalie] Big beautiful bars, thank you. Thank you. Ooh, maybe we should do two, alright? Thank you. Hmm, yummy. They almost look like a little reindeer poop or something. [laughs] - It it has to be. - They're really good. Yeah. Gingerbread cookie. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Beebee, did we forget to turn the oven off or something? We never turned it on. Oh, but maybe we forgot to tidy up. I didn't forget, we really didn't have time. Natalie, what is that? What is this? This cooking, huh? What is this? Hmm? I'm sorry, I think we may have left the kitchen a little not clean. Not clean. I come inside and I take a look and I say what'd I say... What I... [speaks Italian] [speaks Italian] Oh, grande like grand, a big a big mess. Uh yeah, it's a big mess. We have only one day left, so much to do and you run off for this. Uh, why don't you take my half and head back to the restaurant and get started on the clean-up. Hmm. Explain to me. Yeah, I'll help. Oh, you don't have to do that, it wasn't your mess. No, no, I wanna help. You do? Yeah, Chef Stefano scares me when he's like this. I don't even know what these cookies are? Oh look, these are shortbreads with a little um, icing drizzl, and this little gingerbread man. Little gingerbread man, "Can't catch me, I'm a gingerbread man." No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, Natalie. This is an Italian feast of Natale, not the American feast of cookie. - Capito? - Mhmm. We will do panettone made by my family recipe, capisce? - And the cookies. - Mamma mia. [Natalie] I read on Miles' reviews, I think he would really like [Miles] Uh, Natalie. Stefano. Speak of the devil. Hello. - Ariella, ciao. - Ciao, Stefano. [kissing] Mr. Croaker. - Natalie, ciao. - Hello. [kissing] Well, everybody is so excited and looking forward to your feast of Natale. [laughs] So are we. We uh, we're just gonna head back there and get some things ready. We want it all to be just perfect. That means you're coming to the Christmas festival, it's about to start. Oh, no, no, there is so much to do. - Sorry, yeah. - [Natalie] So much to do. More than ever. But it's our first annual Christmas festival, you must come. We need everyone to make it a success. I organized it myself. If you insist. We'll be there with bells on. - Like jingle bells. - [Stefano] Oh. Um, cool uh, we'll just go get ready now. - See you soon. - Do that. See you soon. [indistinct chatter] Alright, alright, this way. Get on there. Okay, you there. [laughing] Okay, ready. Cheese. - [Tyler] Yes! - [Stall holder] Congratulations! Thank you. Here. Thank you. [Miles] Oh, you're here! [laughs] I have just the thing. Right this way. Oh uh, but first, picture. Right, right, here we go! Here we go, have to keep the line moving. [laughs] Sit down, Sparky. Sit down. This one looks fun. Oh yeah, sure. Thanks. Go first. Sure, yeah. Okay, wooh. Aw. No good, here let me try. It's okay. Do you feel okay? Yeah. How do I look like I'm feeling? Well, I don't know, but but nothing good. [taking deep breaths] So uh, have you seen any good Kung fu movies lately? Mm, nope. Why? Uh, just just curious. What about baseball games? In December? Well, at least you know they don't play baseball in the winter. Yeah, well, that's all I know, so Yeah, I forgot to ask uh, about what you do in the city? What is your job? Oh, I'm a Jacklyn of all trades. I watch the dogs and design custom prints, do specialty gift-wrapping, plan events and parties, and about a hundred other things. Huh, why do you do so many things? Why don't you just do one thing? I don't know, I guess I just never found the right thing and so I kept trying new things. Hmm, when I was 3 years old my Zio Lorenzo, he put a knife in my hand and I knew I would be a chef. That is all I ever wanna be. Your Zio Lorenzo gave a butcher's knife to a 3-year-old? No. Maybe I exaggerate a little bit, huh? Well, maybe you're exaggerating now. Maybe you're afraid, huh? I'm not scared of anything. Except perhaps the cold, yes? It's not that bad. No, you're cold. What's that? What's what? The piece of paper you keep checking. What, what piece of paper? The one in your pocket. Um Catch! No! Beebee, Beebee, no, no, no, no. Don't, don't. Oh, what is it, a letter to Santa? [Tyler] Don't just don't just don't just don't just can can you give it back to me please, Beebee? [indistinct chatter in background] What is this? "My smile, awesomeness, likes baseball." What is this, like a list of things I'm supposed to be or something? No, it's... I'm not hardly any of these things. Beebee, it's not like that, it's just... I was just trying to be logical, that's all. You're a jerk. Beebee. Beebee. Beebee, what's the matter? What happened? Are you okay? It's Tyler, he's being really logical. I can't Okay, let's go have some cocoa, you can tell me about it. Grazie. Why don't you start at the beginning? We were at the Santa sling booth and I was I was trying to figure out how Tyler felt about me. He started asking all these stupid questions about Kung fu, baseball, checking his stupid list. [sighs] [Beebee] He said he was just trying to be logical. But then he can't possibly like me, I don't like any of the things on the stupid list, especially not the nice smile part. Oh. Beebee, hey. Your smile is lovely just how it is, I promise. What could give Tyler such a silly idea like this? "Speaks Italian, lives at the same place, loves to cook." You okay? Yeah. Of course, um, what happened next? Well, I decided my intuition was telling me Tyler is a jerk and I left. But maybe you should just sleep on it, yeah? Give your intuition some time to think it over. Yeah, I think I'll do that. Christmas is exhausting. [sighs] Everything okay? You know, I think I'm just gonna go back to the restaurant. But the festival is important. [speaking Italian] Si. And Natalie is here, too. But we were thinking uh, we're gonna go back, it's there's so much to do. Oh no, you don't have to go, too. You can stay, I'm sure you want to. What, and let you do all the work? No. What if you try to cook and burn the entire place down to the ground? [laughs] [speaking Italian] It is time to sing. You must come, you need to with me. Ooh, Sparky. Sorry. Sorry, Sparky. [speaking Italian] Grazie. ♪ Angels we have heard on high Sweetly ♪ ♪ singing o'er the plains ♪ ♪ And the mountains in reply Echoing their joyous strains ♪ ♪ Gloria In excelsis Deo ♪ ♪ Gloria In excelsis Deo ♪ [Stefano] Natalie! Where are you going? Home. Home. The festival just started, uh, you don't like it. Look, can I ask you something? Yes. Can we just keep things strictly business between the two of us? Strictly business? I know something is wrong, I can tell. And it is a word for it uh, a word that is not a word. Uh, you are eh. A fork? Hangry. You need to eat and Sparky, too. Let's go to Pezzo Di Parma, I will cook for the both of you, let's go. Listen, I said I just wanna keep things strictly business. What how? How strictly business? Business is food, food is business for me. How is it not strictly business? The thing is I don't know if we're really ready to be a business. I mean I don't know if we're really ready to do a big feast of Natale, not for this many people and not for Miles who's never given a rave restaurant review in his entire life. He hasn't, not ever? No. And I read all of them and worse, every place he pens, it shuts down. Natalie, I put every bit of money I have in Pezzo Di Parma. I didn't know that. And if we close, Natalie, it's worse uh, I cannot stay in America, I have to go back to Italy. See, we uh we can't do this to you. Or to cousin Olivia, we can't ruin your dreams before they've even begun. Now you think my food is not good enough, huh? That's not what I'm saying, I just we don't have the time or the people And this is why you don't want to come to eat now? It's not about that, I just don't - Natalie. - What? If my food is not good enough for you, certo is not good enough for anybody. Anybody. The feast of Natale, Natalie, is off. Fine. [grunts] Fine! Fine! - It's off! - [Stefano] Okay. God, stupid Stefano. Come on, Sparky. Come. [Natalie sighs] Panettone, panettone. I'll make panettone, it'll make me feel better. [Natalie] It's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay, come on. This way, this way. [carolers singing Christmas carol in distance] Ooh, Natalie. What are you doing here? Uh, Mr. Croaker, there is something I need to tell you and um, I thought I should probably say it in person. [sighs] I'm very sorry. And please don't hold this against my cousin Olivia or Stefano, but Um Uh, what's wrong? Has something happened? Stefano, you didn't have to come, I can take care of this myself. This is not only your cousin Olivia restaurant, it it's also mine. Has someone had bad news? Oh, oh no, nothing like that, they're just missing their friends and family because it's Christmas. I thought singing might cheer them up, but uh, it's made things worse. Cassie has never spent a Christmas away from her children before. Oh, and this was supposed to be Charlie's first Christmas with his new fiancé. Oh no, that's so sad. [Miles] There'll be other Christmases, but right now it's hard for them all to be far away from home. But everyone is looking forward to your Christmas meal tomorrow. [laughs] Now what is it you wanted to tell me? Could you excuse us just one minute? I feel terrible. I feel terrible. Yeah, me too. I wanted to do everything my own way, just the right review, but now look at this. I wanted to show Olivia how much her help and support meant to me and I guess I thought I could only do that if everything was perfect. [sighs] I think I kind of lost seeing that's it's Christmas. Yeah, yeah, it's Christmas. [speaks Italian] And the kitchen. Yes, in there, too. What if we just go through with it? What if we don't worry about if it's perfect or what the review says, what if we just do it to feed a bunch of sad people that have nowhere else to go on Christmas? Yes, yes. Let's do it for the people. And we need to be happy, it's Christmas. - Okay? - Okay. Let's do it. [sighs] Natalie, Stefano, uh you had something to tell us? Yeah, just that the feast of Natale is at 1:00 and to bring your appetites. [Miles laughing] It's gonna be awesomeness.

The Olio d'oliva descadoni? Yeah. I've been looking for it everywhere. Back-ordered? Until when? July. Oh um, oh. [Natalie] Okay, thanks anyways. You wanna tell me what's got you so despondent over this olive oil? Olivia! - Hi. - Hi. Oh, but how? Oh, they finally dug Rome out from under that avalanche, I got the first flight I could. Why are you here? I thought you were spending Christmas with your friends in the city. I was, but I don't know I know how hard you worked and how much this means to you, so I just... Oh, it's so beautiful. Thank you. But why? It's a long, long story. Oh. Is it now? Well, that's good, 'cause I am a long, long listener. [laughs] Well, even after... [exhales] 22 phone calls, and a dozen international emails, and millions of hours scouring the internet, I still couldn't find the Olio d'oliva descadoni, so Stefano could have his perfect Christmas. Do you like Stefano? No! I mean I like him. I don't like-like him. He's kinda grumpy sometimes. Oh. So you don't like him? [laughs] Even if I did, I have to go back to the city. I have a life there and I don't know, I can't stay here. You're jumping again. I'm what? You do this thing where you leap from job to job, city to city. What are you afraid of? I'm not scared of anything. Falling in love can be scary. Well, it's been a long flight and an even longer day and I think tomorrow is gonna be really, really exciting. Let's go home. Oh, I'm so glad you could make it home in time for Christmas. Me too. Oh, um and if you see any lasagne in the yard, could you just ignore it? You did try to cook again, didn't you? Uh, yeah. It's good that you reach for the stars. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Sorry. Natalie. I'm sorry. Your terribleness in the kitchen is contagious. Uh, you'll be glad I said something. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Oh, you should open that now. Merry Christmas to you, too. Oh. You didn't have to do that. Come on, bella signorina first. If you insist. Is this the recipe for the mystery sauce? You're actually giving away the mystery? Yeah, and this way you don't lie awake at night wondering. Rosemary. [chuckles] Of course. How did I not guess that? Maybe when you go back to your city, you can find someone somehow who can cook it for you. Not just a pizza delivery boy, huh? [Stefano] Capito? Okay. Your turn. [clear throat] Olio d'oliva descadoni. Natalie. Grazie. [inhales and exhales] What's it smell like? Like home. I'm sorry you couldn't be home for Christmas. I know, this is my home now. I still think you could use a pinch of thyme. [sighs] Where are the little elves? - Tyler was here - Be here. He told me that he needed to add something outside, I don't know. Okay. [kisses] [Natalie clear throat] Merry Christmas. - [Beebee] Merry Christmas. - [Tyler] Merry Christmas. Are you guys ready to get to work? - Mhmm, mhmm, yeah. - Sure, totally ready. Great. Places, everybody. Turns out that he likes braces. [Natalie laughs] Gonna give you a little bit more that, a little bit more, mix it in. [inhales and exhales] [Natalie] They're almost here! Merry Christmas! Ciao, Natalie. Buon Natale! Welcome to Ristorante Pezzo Di Parma. [chuckling] Yep, one more. I can take that, no problem. - Merry Christmas. - Thank you, merry Christmas. [grunts] Uh, find a seat. They should be labeled. Go. [indistinct chatter] Alright, fair, fair. Yes, I just got my haircut. Emma, I like your uh, [speaks Italian] - Uh - [Emma] My necklace. Necklace, yeah, oh it's bella. Oh, thank you, thank you very much. Um, they're um, not real. They look real? [Emma] Yeah. Ooh, formaggio. [Emma] Ooh, that looks good. [indistinct speech] I know I'm so hungry, I'm very They're almost done with the antipasto, how's the soup coming along? It's just about. [indistinct chatter] [Natalie] Okay, yep, mhmm. Not yet, not yet. Oh we can we It's just about. Okay, go. That was suspenseful. This is for you. You need to keep up your strength. Cocoa with whipped cream and nutmeg. How'd you know my favorite cocoa? Hey, I know. I asked cugina Olivia. Even with everything else you had to do? - Thank you. - Prego. Mmm. [Stefano laughs] Scusi. [laughing] [indistinct chatter] [laughing] - What's so funny? - Niente, niente. [laughs] Do I have food in my teeth? Uh, not your teeth, no. [Stefano aughing] [laughing] Alright. [sighs] [chuckling] Can you get me a napkin or something? Si, si. Now didn't I remember that there was a polar bear - in your driveway one time? - Not anymore, not anymore, I since I've moved here Oh, thank you. We saw one last night, we did. Please try the pasta. We it's a family recipe. - I hope you like it. - Mangiamo. [indistinct chatter] Does he like it? [indistinct chatter] Huh. Hmm. [indistinct chatter] [Miles] Ladies and gentlemen, I have been reviewing restaurants for over 20 years. It has been my privilege to dine in some of the finest establishments in this country. And in that time I have never, not once, tasted a perfect dish. Until now. [indistinct chatter] [Caroler] Bravo to the chef. Take your bow. [Caroler 1] Oh, come on, Chef. Take your bows. [indistinct speech] Thank you, thank you very much. [indistinct speech] Hope you enjoyed. - [Miles] Thank you. - [Stefano] Grazie. Natalie, may I speak with you a moment? Yeah, of course. Uh, alone. Sure. Um, over here. [Laughter] Everything okay with the meal? Can I get you anything else? Oh, it's the most wonderful feast of Natale I've ever had. Not about that I want to ask you. It is uh, you do not actually work for Pezzo Di Parma, this is correct? That's right. I have my own business. Or businesses really, in the city. Good. I am hoping that Stefano will offer me a job once you return to the city. But you're singing. I like Stefano. Oh. I see. [Ariella] You are friends with Stefano? Do you think that maybe he likes me? I don't know. Um, I I think you're perfect for him. Beautiful. Exquisite. Stefano. Ah, it'll be ready in a minute. [Natalie] Great, um, maybe you can give Ariella a minute to talk to you. And you might wanna look at this in case you forgot. Grazie. [Stefano] Ciao. Ciao. [Sobs] We need to change it. Thyme. Really? You took my advice? Only because uh, it was right. Natalie. Why so sad on Christmas? I'm not sad. I'm happy for you and Ariella. Me and Ariella? Of course. She likes you, you have to know that. Yes. And I told her I was happy to give her a job. Not all my heart. But she fits right in with your philosophy of logic, and love, life, and cooking. She fits your list to a tee. Natalie, my philosophy has changed. To what? Panettone! The panettone! [coughing] [Natalie] What happened? Panettone, I burned the panettone. [speaking Italian] But a chef never lets his food burn. Not for anything. I forgot. How could you forget? What are we gonna do about dessert? They're almost finished with the main course. We know. [Natalie] The cookies. Aha. [Olivia] Try the red ones. Alright. There is a family tradition that we have where you go around the dinner table and say what the best part of this Christmas is. I guess I'll go first. Um, for me the best part of this Christmas is being able to get home in time to share it with all of you. And my cousin Natalie, and my friend Stefano, who made all of this possible. [laughing] The best part of this Christmas has been sharing this meal with all of you all and my elastic waistband which made all of it possible. [Natalie] Cheers. Oh, um my favorite part of this Christmas is um, well, I've always kind of been jumping around from job to job, waiting for something to tell me that I finally have found the perfect thing. And nothing ever felt quite right. But this year, this Christmas [inhales] um, I finally found a place that feels like home. And someone I'd really like to share it with. Stefano. My favorite part of this Christmas, uh well You, Natalie. It is this. [kissing] [Guests cheering] Why are we all watching? Oh my gosh!
