"The Tarix Jabrix 2" "Population, Root of Problems in DKI" "110 Thousands Newcomer Enter DKI" "Brother of Kiddy Singer Kidnapped" Help, Coki. Don't be reckless. "Bike Garage Sugema Jl. Cilaki No 13 Bandung" "Don't Forget Today "The Tarix Jabrix" Gather" You haven't finished your work yet? We just moved in! How will we get customers? - Morning, Sir Mulder! - Morning! Your bike is cleaned. How is it? Where's the key? Not this bike, but Biji Nangka. Where's the key? - Here it is. - Yes. What if your father gets angry? He won't be angry, just tell him I go out for a while. What will I ride? Just take my bike. That's too big for me, Sir. Just try. - Tarix Jabrix! - Tarix Jabrix! Here it is! Coki Nurhidayat! - Ciko Nurhidayat! - Dadang! Going to college! Cing, what's going on? You're not accepted, Cing? Chill, Cing, there's still next year. Then next year and the next, and the next, Cing. Don't you realized? We're all going to different places. Look, Ciko in Padang, Coki in Bandung. Dadang in Irian, Mulder in Bali, I'm in Surabaya. Do you guys want we're all separated? Do you still want the porridge? How many bowls? Just call, Cok. I talked to Father last night. - And? - He said for a year... ... I can't be doing nothing. Wherever it is, I have to go to college, Cing. Yes, Cing, looks like I'm gonna have to be in Bandung. Help Father. Irian is so far away. I'm afraid to be alone. Co-Ci, how about you? What of us? College. I can't be apart from Coki. Same, I can't be apart from Ciko too. Goodness. What then? Dang, here. I've got an idea. What if we go to college in Jakarta? - In Jakarta? - In Jakarta? If it's private college, why Jakarta, Cing? A lot of good private colleges in Bandung. It's not about private or general colleges, Mul. It's about togetherness. What do you say? We go sailing, Cing! Find mermaids! Yeah! Study in Jakarta. It's up to Ciko for me. Now I'm confused. Jakarta is only two hours away from Bandung. Easy coming and going. Commute. Wasting time on the road, Dang. Getting old on the road, Dang. - Silly. - I know. - Know what? - Why you want to study in Jakarta. You want to forget Callista who went to London for school. It's not it, Mul! - So? - Different thing. We, as The Tarix Jabrix, have to be able to open our minds. We have to look for new adventures. Tarix Jabrix has to be exist in the capital. Cing, something went into Ciko's shoe! - What? My goodness! - Yes, something. Everybody pray. Go away, evil spirit. Stop talking about shoe! What do you say? - Jakarta? - Shall we? Jakarta? - Tarix Jabrix! - Tarix Jabrix! - My bike! - Sorry, too heavy. - Where are you going? - Jakarta, Mul. Cing, hold the bike. - I got it. - Yes. Why do you bring your mattress? We are both in one room. The other one is for Coki. Dadang! Why are they here? Want to convince you to go to Jakarta? Just want to say goodbye, Father. Don't you dare change your mind! I'll change your looks. You don't know Jakarta. - Thank you. Give me a moment. - Yes. - Dang, we're going. - Yes. "Bike Garage Sugema" I'll say goodbye to Father. No need, Cing! Let me do it for you. Okay, then. Actually, I also want to go to Jakarta. But I need to help Father. You guys take care there. - Good luck, Dang. - Dadang, good luck. - Tarix Jabrix! - Tarix Jabrix! Dadang! As always, safety first. Check tires. Check rear view mirror. Check helmet. Check glasses. Cing, I wear full face helmet. Okay, you don't need to. Gentlemen, start your engine. Start, Cing. Let's go! Cing! If we want to go fast, just follow him! Go! Is tonight our schedule to patrol? I don't know. So, why are we doing it, Cing? Be initiative, rather than being told to. We are adults. Attention! Are you patrolling or go to war? Who cares? Looks are the most important. "Jab!!" "Brix!!!" Hold on, I'm busy. All of us here do not believe you are residents. True, we don't believe! They are illegals, Bro! No, Sir! We are legals! Yes, sir! I swear! I swear, we are students! No thieves confess! Let's beat them! Wait, what's going on here? Wait a minute. What's going on here? - This is our leader. - What is it? Illegals, Sir! They are new students who lease Mpok Mini's house. - Correct, Sir! Those are us! - Right, Sir! Why are you outside at this time of night? Right, why is that? We were patrolling, Sir. You smart mouth. Let me tell you. We are all here busy. Security is handled by these men. Understood? Neighborhood watch is hillbilly stuff. - Hillbilly. - This is the capital. Still doing neighborhood watch? Understood? "Smart Ass Residents!! Hillbilly" Warm up first before jogging. - Yes. - Yes. - You lead, Mul. - Okay. - There's a community service. - Where? - Call Cacing, Cok. - What for? Let's help them. Okay. What, are you done already? - Sir. - Yes, Sir. There are residents volunteering. - The residents? - Yes, Sir, there. Volunteering? Cacing is counting worms. So Jakarta is not flooded. Clean that part. Forward. - What are you doing? - Morning, Sir. - Morning. - Sir. What are you guys doing? Community service. Work together. - Peaceful and prosperous. - And fertile land. I told you. Everything here has been taken care of. Even for sewer and garbage issue. Just pay your dues. - Dues? - Dues? "Monthly Dues" Didn't you see the sign? Ride carefully. Cing. Miss, everybody ignores that sign. Why are you doing the same as those trespassers? Sorry. Wow, she's pretty. - Patience! - Move! Men. Patience! Cing! Isn't there any other way? This is too much! "Monas, Cing!" "Wait up, Cing!" "Istiqlal Mosque!" I'm exhausted. We wanted to have fun, but everything's ruined. If this is the condition, it's so hard living in Jakarta. Agreed. No refreshing, just headache. Right, Cok. Living in Jakarta turns people into selfish beings. Agreed. Just look, community service, neighborhood watch, politeness,... ... have all been a rare thing. Just chill. Here, have a drink. - Here, open. - This is fresh. - Just drink. - Maybe sour. It's just a matter of time. That's just it, we can turn into egoistic. No, we won't. As long as we're together, we can remind each other. Living in Jakarta is too competitive. No togetherness. I'm sure we can get through this kind of problem. As long as we're together, we can easily get through it. Right? "Exit" Cing, just park here. That's my space, my car. But it was empty. Come on, move. Just because he owns a car. Discrimination. Bike's parking space is so far away. Right, Cing. That car hasn't even done being painted, but he's so smug. Tanks are better. They're green. Obvious. Mul. Mul! You guys go ahead. - No solidarity. - Lousy Mul. - Come on. - Come on. What's up, Cing? What is it? Cacing's business. What is he doing? You're right. No need following others. - Wormy! - Wormy! - Cing. - Totally failed. Let's go to class. We're late. Check! - Wait a minute. - No resistance. - Wait a minute. - Sir. - No resistance. - Excuse me, Sir. Please open the portal, Sir. Gosh. Can't you read? It's closed. I'm check mate too. Sorry, Sir. We were lost, Sir. "Portal Closed 21.00-06.00" Go, go! He gave us nothing. It's tough in Jakarta. Inhumane. Where have you been, Cing? Right, it's tough in Jakarta. Full of struggle. But we can't just give up. We need a strategy. We are already on offense, 4-4-2 formation. No, no. What if we chip in to buy a car? Who's we? All of us. You're crazy. My father rides a bike to work, now we want a car. You have a death wish? Right, Cing. We are first-years, but ask to buy a car. With what money? Why Javanese accent all of a sudden? We use strategy. We sell our bikes, then use the money to buy a car. No way, I'm not used to cars. I'm comfortable with bikes. You all complained yesterday. Jakarta is nothing but bad traffic, hot and pollution. All those careless driving. You have to remember, if we ride a bike... ... we won't have any girls. Those are the risks living in Jakarta. We have discussed this, haven't we? That's it, Mul. I'm making a strategy... ... to minimize all those risks. Then what about Tarix Jabrix? Tarix Jabrix still exists. Still us. Not limited with bikes or cars. What do you think, Cok? Well... Why don't we call Dadang? Right? Wait a minute. Assalamu'alaikum, Dadang? It's Ciko. Listen, Dang. We plan to sell our bikes and buy a car. What do you think, Dang? Okay, thanks, Dang. Assalamu'alaikum. Send my regards to Mr Rohim. - What did he say? - He said it's up to us. Right, if there are damages, Dadang can not help. Dadang doesn't understand cars. Okay. What do you think, Cik? It's up to Coki. Keeps going round and round. Cok, what do you think? True, cars are more comfortable. This is Jakarta, Bro. We need comfortable vehicle. It's not about comfort. It's about idealism. I'm out. Goal! You're in front of the TV. Move. Again, Cok. Nice having business with you. Thank you, Sir. These are the registrations. - It's all in here. - Yes, Sir. This is the key. - Bye. - Bye. Let's go, Mr Bald. Be good, Vep. Ciko, let it go. - I'm going with Vepi. - Ciko. Let it go. Because everything will come back to him. Now, let's buy a car. This is 1972 VW Safari. Do you understand VWs? It's alright. But you know Hitler? "For Sale" Hitler, who is considered a war criminal... ... leave this fine vehicle and are still used nowadays. - What's the price? - Only 12 millions. Well? - Deal! - Deal! - Deal! Okay! - We bring cash. Just a second, I'll get the key and papers. Please, have a look. Yes, Sir. We still have three millions left. For rims, Cing. My goodness! Coki! Careful, we're being duped! No engine in this car! Seriously, Cing? - See for yourselves. - My goodness. We are totally duped. - Let's just go, Cing. - Right. Cok, Cik, wait! Wait. - Tired. - What is it, Cing? Clear. He's crazy! No wonder he sells car late at night. He wanted to dupe us. It is hard finding a 15-million car in Jakarta, Cing. If only cars fell from the sky, Cing. Like in the movies. My goodness! - Not people. Car. - Yes. - What are you doing, Bro? - Fixing that. So you just been duped? By who? By the car owner next door. VW Safari with no engine was sold 12 millions! I opened the hood myself. No engine! Gosh! All VW Safari, VW Beetle, VW Kombi,... ... the engines are at the back, never at the front. Now, what kind of car do you need? Just choose. Hello! Oh my goodness! Can't you see it's a car? Arrived at lucky campus. - With alarm? - Nope, just for fun. Good afternoon, class. Good afternoon, Sir. Let's continue from yesterday. Point of view is the first and foremost for us... ... to analyze a project... Hey, you! What did I explain just now? - Point of view, Sir. - What is point of view? Give us example. Point of view... The woman next to you... ... maybe if she's seen from your point of view... Maybe she's ordinary. But if seen from my point of view, she's so pretty, Sir. You made it up? But it's true. Now I'm handing out the textbooks. Read it, then we'll discuss. You, come here. Yes, you. Please hand them out. I'm going to the toilet. Sir. Excuse me, Sir. Sorry, Sir, your fly. Excuse me, Sir. Thank goodness. Sir, there are still some left. Sir, you left your textbook. Oh my goodness! What happened, Sir? - Cik, what did you do? - I don't know. - He passed out. - What is it? - Sir? - Sir! Bro, can I borrow the stapler? Just a second, Miss. Ma'am, do you have Manajemen Power Tools book? "Circulation Service" Have you look that way? - I have. - And? Nothing, Ma'am. Someone must've borrowed it. You're too late. Just for a while, Bro. Just... Wait, I have another in my bag. Here. Not this one. Bro! Bro, it's not your copy. Sorry. - Miss. - My goodness. I forgot. Thanks. Are you looking for this book? - Give me that. - What the heck? Something's wrong. Just say it if you want to meet me. No need to act like this. It's not soap opera! I wasn't acting. It's for real. Cik! She's not the one who borrowed your stapler. This one. You must be looking for this book. - Are they twins too? - Yup. Just like us. - What's your name? - Lala. - And your name? - Lili. Must be short from Tralala, Trilili. "Put down your food and drink, let's sing together." Pack your things Where are we going Hills and valleys We'll get through Rather than doing nothing, Just play the guitar Yeah, hit it Yay - Bye, guys. - Where are you going, Mul? Still early. You'll just be sleeping at home. We haven't taken pictures. I got a task, must find a textbook. We all have tasks, Mul. Just chill. You have a car. I'm riding a bike. Mul... Serious, this meatball is yummy. Come eat first. Thanks, Cing, I'm still full. - Bye. - Take care, Mul! - Take care. - Wear a helmet! - Hello! - The Beauty! - Sit here. - Come sit. - Sit. - Where were you guys?

Do you remember? - Attention! - What's that? Meatball. - Who wants some? - Me! - One for me. - Me too. Make it two. - Four. - Five, please. - Are you sure? - No, thanks. I'm still full.

Wormy! Okay! Okay! Who else wants to challenge Valent? Come on. Who else dares? - Come on! - Come on! Who else? Who else? Come on. Who dares challenge Valent? - Who else? - I challenge Valent. You dare? You're new here? I'm Mulder. We have a new challenger. Everybody, we party tonight! Hello, Dang. My goodness. Cok, look at Cacing. He's frustrated for not having a girl. Cing, wake up. - That's animal. - Yes, wake up. What the heck? Can't I watch wildlife channel? He's polishing shoes. Why so late at night? I'm upset. Cacing. I think I've found the love of my life. A beautiful woman who will be spending her days with me. When I'm sad, when I'm happy. Do you think Milinka suits me? Darn, you fell asleep when I'm talking with you. - Assalamu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalam. Where were you, Mul? None of your business. Why so grumpy? Why so angry? Don't be like that, Honey. Delirious. Cok, the bumper's still dry. Cik, what's that at the right? - Where, Cing? - Why can't you wipe it right? Cing, what are you doing? We've shared the tasks. Coki sprays. You wipe. I have two tasks. Control and supervise. - You're missing one, Cing. - What's that? Find a mate! It's wet, you crazy! Stop it. - Here we are, Dang. It's near. - It's near. - Dadang! - Dadang! You're here!

When it's done, you wake me up. Okay. He says he has a house, but always sleeps here. - Maybe he's fostered. - Maybe. Here, Dang. I'd like this bike to be faster. - Can you? - Don't worry, Mul. In Dadang's hands, everything's done. Dadang is the best! Mul, but if you want this bike to be faster,... ... you can do it yourself, Mul. - Really? How, Dang? - Easy. Put this bike in an airplane. Wait till it's airborne. Surely it's fast. Funny. Why do you want it faster, Mul? It's already fast. Don't tell the others, Dang. Why can't the others know, Mul? We are The Tarix Jabrix. Let there be no lies between us, Mul. No, Dang. They must not know. Promise me, okay? Okay, I promise. - I join street racing. - What? Silence, Dang. - Street racing? - Yes, Dang.

His car is loud, Sir. - He's lying, Sir. - Whose car is this? - Theirs, Sir. - Whose car is this? - Mine, Sir. - You've messed up my concert! Do you know how much I spent for this concert? I lost so much because of you. Who's paying for it? - Who's paying? - Not me, Sir. Do you how hard it is bringing artist here? They run away, Sir! They cause all of this! - Which one? - That one! - Hey! - Run! Take that! Milinka! Lala, Lili! Where are you going? They are still after us, Cing. - What about Milinka, Dang? - That's easy. Step on it, Cing. Step on it, Cing! Cing, The Asphalt is behind us. Shut up! I'm stepping on it! You're not helping! Okay, we help Cacing. Everybody, heads down. So it can be faster. Where are we, Mul? Are we meeting Cacing, Ciko and Coki here? No, Dang, this is the street racing I told you about. Street racing? Street racing? Did you tell me about it? Dang. Did you take a nap? Are you Mulder? What do you want to give me this time? What about your jacket? Not even jacket, you can take the bike if you can win. I'll wait at the start line. Cing, turn right. Get in there. Yo! - What is this? - Calm down, Sir. - I'm looking for Alek. - I don't care who you're looking for. Whose house is this? You don't know who I am? - You don't know who I am? - I think this is Alek's house. - He's bald and has big eyes. - Wrong, this is my house. - Yes, Sir. - Get out of here. - Sir, is it Aldi's? - Get out! Dewi's? Get out! Saiful Jamil's? Come on. So glad this mechanic came from Bandung. Dadang! Nice jacket? Jacket. Who's that? Net Warrior. Net Warrior? He's unbeatable in this arena. Really? Engine 1,000cc DOHC, year 2005. One more thing. Nobody knows who he really is. Guys. Dang, what do you think? I think don't be reckless, Mul. His bike... - Not yet proven. - But, Mul... Come on, Dang! It's crazy, I'm beaten by a girl. Two chilies? Where are Mulder and Dadang? Why are they not here yet? Why are you silent? Crackers. Thank you, Cacing. Mulder's here. With Dadang. Where were you? Boni chased me. You didn't help, but went away. Sorry, Cing, we got lost. Right, Dang? Yes, I didn't know where we were. - But lots of bikes. - Dang. You said you want to massage me. Let's do it now. My whole body is sore. Riding the whole day. Bye, Cing. Cik Cok. There's something weird with Mulder. - Yes, Mulder gets easily tired. - And asked Dadang for a massage. We're here. Bye. Assalamu'alaikum. - Mom? - What is it, Mom? - Hungry. - What? Sir, Di? Assalamu'alaikum. Cing, my brother Dona Doni is kidnapped. What? - Is Dona Doni twins? - No, Dona Doni is one person. The kidnapper asked for a ransom with this letter. Nothing in here. The other side. "If you want Dona Doni back, get me 100 millions cash. Don't tried..." - "Don't try." - "Don't try contacting the police." - We can contact the leader. - Right, Cing. Seriously, silly. It means no contacting anybody. - Okay. - Where are you going? Where to? Wait, shoes. Dad, Mom, these are our friends. - Hello, Sir, I'm Coki. - I'm Ciko. Ma'am. I'm Cacing. - What if we try to find Dona Doni? - Agreed. - Where do we find him? - Right, Jakarta is so vast. Let's start from the crime scene. Dona Doni's school. Yeah! What are you doing? Shoo, go away. Do you think it's a game? - What are you doing? - Look, Sir. - Look, we are from the police. - Yes. We are investigating a kidnapping of a child... ... named Dona Doni. Dona Doni? Mul! Mul, eat first. Eat. I keep thinking about the girl who beat me at the race... ... yesterday, Dang. Order your meal first. Dang, listen to me. Eat later. The girl from the street racing. - A girl? - Do you remember? Street racing? - Ah yes. - That girl, Dang. Rich girl? Okay. I didn't write that down, Mul. Gosh, Dang. The point is, right now I'm in love with her. - And then? - Nothing. How to get that girl, Dang. Don't ask me about girls, Mul. Ask Cacing. Cacing this, Cacing that. Ask Cacing everything. Who is Cacing anyway? Ma'am, one worm rice. I mean, beef. According to Mr Security, Dona Doni was supposed to be last seen... ... around here. Cing, I'm hungry. Yes, my stomach is rumbling. So fussy. Everybody's hungry. - Where is Doni? - Don't worry. Cacing has a big nose. He can smell really well. - Agreed? - Agreed. Stop. Stop. Guys. Look at the fritter seller. Cing, do you like fritter seller now? Don't worry, you can still fight for Milinka. Yes, Cing. Silly! Look at him. Since when fritter seller wears a helmet? Each to his own. Right. Whether it's sunglasses or green underwear. It's up to him. - Cing. - Cing? Bro, is there any standardized selling fritters... ... one must wear a helmet, just like in construction area? - Nope. - Did you come here by motorbike? Nope, I push this cart! Then why wear a helmet? This helmet? A kid left it here. I wear it because it's a nice helmet. Helmet! Can I see the helmet? Look, the engine. Strange. - Can we take the helmet? - No, it's mine. You can't just take it. Though it belongs to someone, but if no one claims it after 24 hours,... ... this belongs to me. How about this? Barter it with my jacket. This is an expensive jacket. Made in Italy. The designer's dead, and this jacket is expensive. Okay. Good. Plus with the hat, because you're so nice. - Okay? - Thanks. Hopefully this helmet gives a clue. Right? - Right. - Amen. Bruno. Relaxing, eh? - Change places. - Later. No way. Do you want me to tell your boss? - You dare tell the boss? - Go, go. Okay, you fuss. Where are you going? What is it, Sar? I want to take a leak first. - Want to see? - What did you say? - I bet yours is like a pencil. - Even though it's like a pencil,... ... but when it's sharpened, it's piercing nicely. Come along. - Just go, hurry up. - Come. Goal! Yes! Goal! Wow, it looks so exciting. Why didn't you finish your meal? Can I have it? - Okay, you can have it. - Yes. Play first, then you can eat. - All of it? - Yes. - Okay. - Quiet. Want to challenge me? Good afternoon, Boss. Everything's under control. Okay, Boss, just finished eating, and now is playing PS. Yes, Boss. Both of us are watching him with extra maximum security. - Yes, Boss. - Goal! Excuse me, Bro. Do you know where they sell helmet like this? Take a look. They sell these in Pasar Minggu. Are they open in Friday? "Sorry, do you know where they sell this? Dreft ich hug ain dof?" "Are you ojek driver? Ich bin aus hug raben?" "Come on, Sir. I Love You Bibeh" "For you who know who sells this helmet... ... please call us at 72777777." - No. - Come on, eat. We'll play again later. We take turns eating. Yes, but you finish it first. Okay. Now it's your turn. Put a lot of chili, that's too little. Here. Now eat. - Take that. - Bro, hurry up. My stomach hurts so bad. We're here already. So fussy. Take that, tricked by a kid. Naughty. I'm out for a while. I want to buy a drink. - Okay. - Stay, don't go anywhere. Okay. Whatever I do, still won't come out. Constipated? How's Doni? He's sleeping at the back. I'll check him. Oh no! Bruno! Dona Doni's gone! Gone? How come? - Oh no. - Maybe he's kidnapped, Sar. What do you mean? We're the kidnappers! Go, find him. We're screwed. There he is. Go, after him. There he is. Who's the fat lady, Sar? Don't worry. She's playing with her phone. People like that are careless. She looks scary, Sar. There she goes. Go grab him. - Now? - Yes, now. Help! Ouch. Why are you here? Go back to your mother. - Go. - Just take her. Get in. Get in, quick, Sar. Anis? Anis? This looks like handmade. - Handmade? - Yes, they race a lot... ... in the streets. I see. - Okay, thanks, Bro. - Okay. How was it? He said it's possible this helmet owner... - ...is a street racer. - What? It's dangerous. Another bike gang? Could be. La, Li, it looks like this could be men's matter. It's better we take you home. Mul. Mulder Drajat! What is it, Dang? Somebody called? You look like a girl. You interrupted my shower. Mul. Mul... - What now, Dang? - Come here. - Just for a second. - What, Dang? I miss it, Mul. I miss the five of us together as The Tarix Jabrix. Eat together. Hang out together. Riding bikes together. I don't see all that anymore. Everyone broke Tarix Jabrix's pledges. Cacing, Coki, Ciko. They drive a car now. And you are into street racing. Why did I come here... ... just to take a risk being a rebellious son... ... when The Tarix Jabrix ends up like this. I'm sad, Mul. I'm sorry, Dang. It's touching, Mul, uncomfortable! Sorry, we're done. Dang, this is bad. This is bad. Truly bad, Cing. I think it's chronic. You knew? I saw it with my own two eyes. That means you know who the kidnappers are? Kidnappers? It's not about kidnappers, Cing. It's about Tarix Jabrix. Jabrix? Cing, I know you have a problem with Mulder. Ciko, Coki. You only care for your girlfriends. Where has our friendship all these years gone... ... in one family Tarix Jabrix? If it keeps going like this,... ... I'd rather go back to Bandung. Stop staring. Okay then, I'm going back tomorrow. Don't, Dang. Don't, Dang. No, Dang. We're sorry. Hello? What is it? Lala Lili's brother is kidnapped. Who's been kidnapped? Dona Doni, Dang. Lala Lili's brother. Dona Doni? - Who's been kidnapped? - Dona Doni. Who is Dona Doni? Dona Doni is Lala Lili's brother. Ciko and Coki's girlfriends. Let's help them, Mul. Poor them. Okay, I'll help. I need to meet somebody first. Well... Hi, still remember me? I'm Mulder. We raced yesterday. The truth is... ... I still can't believe I got beaten by a girl racer as pretty as you. This is for you. Where are you going? What's up, Bon? Excuse me. Is it still about yesterday? Take it easy, Bro. This is not about yesterday. It's something else. About what? I bet you are looking for kidnappers. How do you know? Cing. My brother is also kidnapped. I'm sure it's the same person. Is that Mulder? What's going on? So this is what you're up to? This is what you're doing at night? So what? Mul, do you remember? You've broken the pledge of The Tarix Jabrix. There's no street racing in The Tarix Jabrix. No, Mul! Who do you think I am? Just so you know. Ever since you, Ciko and Coki have a car... ... Tarix Jabrix is ended! - Get it? - You pig! Who do you think you are? Stop! It seems The Tarix Jabrix is no more... ... in your hearts. All of you have broken the pledges of Tarix Jabrix. Do you remember them, Cing? Tarix Jabrix is a polite bike gang. "1. Polite Bike Gang" What next, Mul? Obey traffic regulations. "2. Obey Traffic Regulations" What's the next one? Respect our parents. "3. Respect Our Parents" Friendship is not only in mind. But in our hearts. The Tarix Jabrix... ... is my heart. We're sorry, Dang. Mul. What is it, Mul? Am I smelly? Why do you have this helmet? What about it, Mul? Valent often wears this helmet. Valent? Do you know which one is he? That's the one. See you later. The one's walking to the bike. Let me. Are you Valent? Yes. So? Are you a racer or a kidnapper? None of your business. Where are you going? Don't run! Chase him! You take my bike, it's faster. I'll take the car. Okay. - Take care of the gang. - Okay. - Be careful. - Mul. I'll borrow your jacket, it's cold. Gotcha. Where do you keep Dona Doni? What? I'll never hurt Dona Doni. - Trust me. - I don't trust kidnappers like you. Whatever. I'm Dona Doni's brother. Then who are Lala Lili to you? Lala Lili are also my sisters. It's a family matter, Pal. Don't interfere. But you've broken the rules. The law. What? The law? What law? Because I'm the first-born? I'm the eldest? And then I'm punished... ... not getting the same love as my siblings? Let my parents know... ... their children are not only Lala Lili and Dona Doni. I'm still here. Besides... ... I also need money to live. But this is not the way. There's no other way. I only know how to do this. Okay. Now I ask you. Where are Alanis and Dona Doni? Safe with me. - I'll take him home tomorrow. - Okay. I'll take your word. Wait. Did you say Alanis? Who's Alanis? Bruno, this is an easy job, eh? We have nice meals... ... and can go places. True, Sar. Let's hope that kid takes us to Bali. I really want to go to Bali. But no more beaches. Walking is so hard for me. Sar... Actually I... I... What? ... want... Where's the kid? What, Sar? Maybe they're drowned. You check first. What? - Where is he? - Go, find him! - Who is it? - The Boss. - Yes, Boss? - Where are you? We are in Ancol. Ancol? What are you doing in Ancol? You told us to give Dona Doni all his wishes. Oh. Okay, now bring him to headquarters. Meet me there. Well... Dona Doni's missing, Boss. Missing? You're crazy! I don't care, you find Dona Doni now! Or you two will be missing! Got that? Okay, Boss. What did he say? You find him quick, or you'll be missing too! I'm looking! Dona Doni's missing. What? He's missing. My friend took him to Ancol... ... and then he's missing. You fool! This is not part of my plan! Sar, where else shall we look? If I'd known, we don't need to find him. But he's nowhere to be seen! - What the heck, Brother! - Okay. Okay, calm down. Everybody calm down. Let's just go to Ancol now. Come on, hurry. Come, La, Li. What is it, Cing? Nothing. - Come on! - Where to? Ancol! Ancol! Thank God, I finally go to Ancol. Thank God. - What are you doing? - Come on! - To Ancol. - Come on. - He's not here. - Where else shall we look? We've looked everywhere. He's nowhere! You didn't watch him! You keep saying that. Where is he? - There! - Where? There he is, Sar! There, Sar! Go after him, hurry! - Excuse me, Miss. - What the heck? - We go first. - Careful, Sir! Come on, go! - Go! - The door will be closing by itself. - Come on! - Where is he? He's gotten far, there! Can you make it faster? Did you find him? Cing, we have to split. Okay. Dona Doni! Dona Doni! Dona Doni! Alanis! Dona Doni! Alanis! We're dead, Bruno. Ancol. Gondola? - Go ahead, Sir. - Can I? - Yes, please. - Hello. Dona Doni! Dona Doni! What shall we do? We're so screwed! May I know your names? - I'm Dadang. - Dona Doni. - Alanis. - Dadang. Dona Doni? Yes. Can I sit in the middle? - Okay. - Really? He's kidnapped! Look, he's kidnapped! Dona Doni! - He's kidnapped! - You're right! - Hey, you! - Somebody's in there! What shall we do? Bro, turn it around! You're so noisy! It can't be turned around! Well? Nothing. Did you find him? - No. - Nothing. - They're my friends! - Where? There, they're my friends. Come here, there they are. Which ones? That's Dadang! Dadang can't be flying. Yes, it's Dadang! Dadang! He's playing around! That's Dona Doni! That's right. Let's go there! Why it's stopping, Sar? - Help! - Nobody here! Get off! Dadang! - Are you Dona Doni? - Yes. We found Dona Doni! Dona Doni? Thank God! - What are you doing, Dang? - You know each other? This is Dona Doni, Dang! - Him? - This is my brother. Why are you so happy? Silly! We're dead, Bruno. We can't get out of here. You're so noisy! - Hurry! - Dad, Mom! Assalamu'alaikum! Dona Doni! - Doni! - Doni! I miss you! Come here, you. Sorry, Dang. Sorry, Dang. - Sorry. - Clean the license plate. I miss riding bikes. Riding bikes with you guys. Agreed. What is Vebi doing? - Vebi? - Vespa Biru. This is... I miss you guys. I'm sorry. But, Mul... I'm sorry too. Take it easy. Sorry, Mul. You're wet, Dadang! Dang, you're wet! - Don't wipe it on me! - Dadang! Is that Mr Rohim's voice? - Impossible. - Dadang! - Father! - His father! Yes, I'm coming home to Bandung right now, Father. I'm not here to pick you up. One of your best friends... ... wants to return something. Yippee! My bike too! My goodness! He's still healthy. That is Dadang's bike. True, that's his bike. Sir, why do you bring his bike too? If a young man can give a surprise for his best friends... ... of course I can also give one to my beloved son. Dadang. After a long thought,... ... you'd better continue your studies in Jakarta. Really, in Jakarta? Thank you, Sir! Finally, we are whole! Tarix Jabrix! I envy them. The world is unfair, Mul! Don't worry. Finding a girl is only a matter of time. You're smart, Dang. All girls will fall for... Yeah, all girls like... What is it, Mul? On Warrior bike, Cing. Silly, that's my Milinka! You should've given the flowers to my sister. There she is. Two? That means... We're brothers, Mul! They are twins? Thank you. Whee! - You're brothers? - With Mulder. You make me envy! Don't worry, Dang. It's only a matter of... Time! Be patient! - Come on! - Let's go! But I still have Father.
