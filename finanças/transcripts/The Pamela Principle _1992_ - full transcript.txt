[MUSIC PLAYING] Mr. Breeding. Hi, I'll be right with you. Mrs. Fester, I'm sorry I'm late. Oh, that's all right, Carl. Oh, no don't be nervous. Just make me look beautiful. No, you look fine. Take this in a little bit over here, Dorritte. That's beautiful, honey. Everything's going to be just fine, sweetie, I'll be right with you, OK? You just relax. [SOBS] [MUSIC PLAYING] You're late, Carl. Two weeks before Christmas, everyone wants to be a December bride. Every woman in town wants something fabulous to wear. Don't I don't want to spill it. Shannon, stop it. That's nice. You'd think these women would learn to plan for these things. Hey, dad, just in time. Hey, Stevie. Put it on the table. Oh, watch that. Yeah. You remember Shannon, right, dad? Yeah, of course. Hi, Shannon. Hi. I thought her name was Barbara. That was last week. Oh, right. JIMMY STEWART (ON TV): Listen, it doesn't make them better customers. You said that the-- what'd you say just a minute ago? They had to wait and save their money before they even thought of a decent home? Wait? Wait for what? Until their children go on and leave them, until they're so old and broken down that-- Do you know how long it takes a working man to save $5,000? [MOANING] Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about, they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have work and pay and live and die-- Mom, dad, we're out of here, OK? JIMMY STEWART (ON TV): Do you know how long it takes a working man to save $5,000? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about-- Stevie, this is "It's a Wonderful Life." It's a Christmas tradition. You can't leave now. JIMMY STEWART (ON TV): Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him. But to you, a frustrated old man-- Well, you know, we're pretty tired. Yeah, Mr. Breeding, we're really beat. OK, OK, be party poopers. Night, kids. JIMMY STEWART (ON TV): --this measly, one-horse institution, if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter. MR. POTTER (ON TV): Sentimental hogwash. I want my motion back. [LAUGHING] [MOANS] [LAUGHS] [MOANS] [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHS] [SIGHS] [MOANS] Carl, what are you doing? Sh. I think Steve is still awake. Now I know what you were doing. Bring back any memories? Sorry. No, it's OK. I'm sorry. Well, if you don't want to, it's OK. No, I mean, yes. I want to. Well, if you insist. It's just that I've got a million things to do tomorrow. Nice, I like this. Yeah, it has a nice hue. OK, if you have any problems, let me know. OK, thank you, Mr. Breeding. Good morning, Mr. Breeding. Good morning. Everything OK? - Absolutely. Good. Hi. Good morning. Be careful with this stuff. It's very delicate. - OK. OK. [CLEARS THROAT] Hi, Jess. Carl, I have a rehearsal with the rabbi in an hour. I can't be late. She should have thought about that eight or nine months ago. Jessica, stop fidgeting. It won't get done. [PHONE RINGING] Got it? Well, I really want to stand out. Believe me, everyone will know you're there. Yeah, Jeannie. Right. Amanda Nichols called. She'll be in tonight instead of tomorrow. Swell. Did you tell her the gown won't be ready until tomorrow? Sure, but you know Amanda. Mr. Breeding, I simply cannot wait any longer. Ms. Fontana, you're fitting was for 2:00. It needs to be tighter. Jessica, if I make it tighter here, you're not going to be able to breathe over here. Well, then I won't breathe. Jessica, they don't exactly make wedding dresses for pregnant women. Now just bear with me, OK? Mr. Breeding? Yes, Ms. Fontana. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. You know, that's very pretty. Let me see the back. OK, we just need to take it in. Excuse me, do you have time for me? Would you just hold your-- horses. Ah! Ms. Fontana. Uh, Dorritte, would you help Ms. Fontana? What? What? Excuse me. You look hassled. No, just a little bit stuck. It seems like everyone wants a Christmas wedding this year. You're the only store I could find open. And I'm going to Topeka for a wedding. I just have to look perfect. You look perfect to me, miss uh-- Atkins, call me Pamela. Pamela, since I've never met anyone from Topeka before, I guess I could squeeze you in. Oh, thank you, Mr. Breeding. Call me call. OK, Carl. Let's see what I have for you. You'll make a lovely bride. Oh, I'm not a bride. Oh. Made of honor? Bridesmaid? Bridesmaid. But I need the dress for the reception. Oh, OK. Let's see what we have here. Well, here's something I've been working on that no one's ever worn. See how it looks. Oh, that's perfect. Try it out. Topeka, huh? Yeah, it's in Kansas. You know, "The Wizard of Oz." So you're new in town? Yeah, I just moved here a few weeks ago. I'm a model/actress, I hope. Anyway, I've been to lots of auditions, commercials mostly. I've been turned down by the best of them-- Coke, Pepsi, Bud Light. Well, I'll be sure never to buy their products. Oh, you're so sweet. Wow. You like it? That's nice. That's nice. Let me see. Good, good. Come over here. Great. Jess, may we? Oh, sorry. Thank you. Take your time. OK, let's see. Longer or shorter? Well, longer always feels better. Must be so hard for you, looking at women's dresses all day long. Hey, I'm a professional, like a doctor. Besides, I very rarely see legs like these. Looks like you might need a change. Uh, the hem is finished. Oh, it's perfect. You really think so. It's perfect. OK. Praying for X-ray vision? Oh, very funny. Ms. Fontana! - No! That's the wrong dressing room! Oh my god. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hi, Pamela. Hi, Carl. I really hate to bother you. But I think I left my appointment book here this afternoon. Yes, Dorritte, did mention finding something. Here it is. Oh god, thank god. My whole life is in here. You've come to my rescue twice today. Hey, it's nothing. Can I walk you to your car? [LAUGHS] I don't have one. It's in-- well, it's in the shop. I mean, I caught a ride with a friend from the valley. Well, I'll take you home then. I live all the way out in Hollywood. It's no big deal. Well, thanks. I appreciate it. Hey, nothing but the best for a girl from Topeka. Great. [MUSIC PLAYING] Well, I better get going. I have an early audition tomorrow. Yeah, I have to get up early tomorrow, big day at work. Bye. [KNOCKING] Call me tomorrow. I'll be home by 11:00. I like you, Carl. Good night. Good night. Jesus Christ, what am I doing? All right, come on. What, are you going to take all year? You're making two sandwiches. Take it easy with the pepper. What are you trying to do? Kill me? Christ. I hope you're not telling anybody you're chef, you know. TOD: Good evening, boys and girls, and welcome to Tod's world, where things are just-- Oh, Barbara, dear, would you do me a favor and make sure these tables are set up for the dinner crowd? Right, Mr. Manning. Thank you. Now, where were we now? This beautiful girl jumps you in your car. Eddie, you wouldn't believe it. Her tits were unbelievable. Her tongue went on forever. And? Well, I mean, I didn't go through with it. What? Why not? Are you crazy? Well, Anne, that's why. I was kissing Pamela but all I could see was Anne. Anne? Anne, what, lying there reciting the grocery list? You know, that's how you described your last romp in the sack with her. Anne is a wonderful woman. It's just that she always looks the same and talks the same and screws the same. I mean, she doesn't surprise me anymore. Pamela is so alive. She's adventurous and impulsive. Yeah, and has a great fucking body. Oh, what a body. You've got to call her. Eddie, you're supposed to be my friend. You're supposed to talk me out of this. What if Anne finds out? She'll kill me. Forget Anne. Think about it as therapy. That's all. You're not doing nothing. It's physical therapy. How am I gonna satisfy this kid? I'm years past my sexual peak. Think about it as a great little hobby. Come on, you gotta call her. You're gonna fuck this thing up. Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Come on. You gotta call her. Let's go. Loosen up. What's the matter with you? You got a great thing here. I'd be crazy to do this. You'll be thanking me later on. Paul, give him the telephone. TOD: And now I get to bring in a gentleman that is normally banned at this nightclub. Tonight, he's going to be-- You sure? I'm positive. How could you even think about this. OK, come on, this is hard enough. All right, go ahead. TOD: Eddie Manning, give him a big hand. Come on, you guys. Thank you very much. [PHONE RINGING] PAMELA (ON PHONE): Hi, this is Pamela, I really-- It's an answering machine. It wasn't meant to be. Maybe she's monitoring her phone calls. Did you leave a message? Well, no. I knew it. She's avoiding me. She thinks I'm an old fart. She doesn't want to have anything to do with me. Call her back. Leave a message. Maybe she's there. Come on. Yeah, I don't want my voice on a recording. What do you think she's gonna do? Hold the tape for ransom? Dial the number. Come on, you're acting like a god damn teenager. What's the matter with you? You're gonna screw this thing up. Trust me. I know what I'm doing. Call her. Call her. OK, OK. Fuck you. Fuck you, too. I'm doing you a favor. Yeah. PAMELA (ON PHONE): Hi, this is Pamela. I really want to talk to you. So please leave a message at the sound of the beep. Uh, Hi, Pamela. This is Carl. Listen, about our fitting last night, I'm ready to finish what we started. Give me a call. I'll be at the shop this afternoon. Thanks. Lord, was that so hard? No. Gee, all right? Come on. Hey, you better keep me posted on this. Yeah, I will. Call me as soon as you hear anything. I want to know exactly what's was going on. Don't worry about it. You're gonna tell me, you promise? Hey, it's a piece of cake. Carl, what are you doing? Mrs. Fester, would you just relax. It's going to work out. Just look at the sleeves! We have plenty of time. The wedding is tomorrow! Carl, I look an idiot! No, the sleeve just needs to be a little bit shorter. He'll leave me at the altar. It's going to be fine, Mrs. Fester. Try to relax. No, it's not. Believe me, it's going to be OK. No. [SOBS] It's going to be OK. Everything else looks terrific. We have plenty of time. I'm going take to take in the waste just a little bit. - [SOBS] - Look at me. Look at me. It's OK. It's OK, honey. It's OK. - No, it's not. - Listen-- Line two, Carl. I look awful. Now, I have a phone call. Just relax. I'm coming right back, OK? I'm going to take it in the back. [SOBBING] This is Carl Breeding. Oh, you sound so professional. Hello there. Sorry, I missed your call. I had a last-minute audition. CARL (ON PHONE): Well, last-minute appointments are what I live for. Well, I'm glad you like to finish what you start. We should set up an appointment. That would be nice. So how about tonight? I think I can find an opening for you. Uh, would you mind holding on a moment? Well, a moment. Yes, Jeanie. We're on. Anne, darling, how are you? What a surprise. ANNE (ON PHONE): Will you have time to pick up a bottle of wine on the way home? Bill and Trudy will be here at 8:00. Yes, dinner with Bill and Trudy. Carl, you didn't forget. Well, of course not, but I'm busy. Something came up. And I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to make it. Carl, I made these plans weeks ago. What could you possibly have to do? I'll be there. It'll wait. I'll be home by 8:00. OK, pick up a nice bottle of Chardonnay, dear. I will. You still there? Well, of course, silly. You didn't tell me what time tonight. Tonight's not going to work out. You know, last-minute stuff. Oh. Well, I know you're really busy. I guess I was really lucky yesterday, huh? We both were. How about tomorrow, 1 o'clock? OK. I'm in apartment 14 upstairs. Hey. I'll be thinking of you tonight. Will you be thinking of me? Yes, I will. Bye, Carl. Bye. [MUSIC PLAYING] I knew I should have called first. Why didn't I call first? Hey! I hate noise. [PHONE RINGING] PAMELA (ON PHONE): Hi, this is Pamela. I really want to talk to you. So please leave a message at the sound of the beep. MARCO (ON PHONE): Hello, Pamela, this is Marco from the dance club. I'd love to see you again. Give me a call, huh? Bye. That teasing little bitch. All right, this is a blessing in disguise. I'm gonna cut my losses and get out of here. But she might be at an audition. I should at least let her know I was here. Oh, damn. [KNOCKING] [KNOCKING] What? I'm terribly sorry to bother you. I just need a pen. Do you have a pen I might borrow? And bring it back. Of course. [PHONE RINGING] PAMELA (ON PHONE): Hi, this is Pamela. I really want to talk to you. So please leave a message at the sound of the beep. AL (ON PHONE): Hey, Pammy, it's Al. Just confirming we're getting together at the Bambam Club. Call me. What am I doing here? Oh, Carl. I am so sorry. Oh, hi. My agent called out of the blue and I had an audition. Hey, I just got here, no problem. Oh, come on. You know, it was one of those last-minute things. Things, right. Oh. I was going to have all of this cleaned up. Don't worry about it. Hi. Hi. What's this? Champagne? Yeah. I'm going to go in the back and cleaned up and freshen up. Why don't you go to the kitchen. There's a couple glasses in there. OK. OK. You don't have to wear anything special on my account. JUDY (ON PHONE): Hi, Pam, Judy. I was wondering, since you're not seeing Steve anymore. Can I get his number? Thanks. Ciao, babe. TONY (ON PHONE): Pamela, Pamela-- You don't have to wear anything at all. TONY (ON PHONE): It is Tony. Please, my love, give me a call. STEVE (ON PHONE): Hi, babe, it's Steve again. Call me over at Phil's. You have the number. BILL (ON PHONE): Pam, it's Bill. Remember, we met at Christy's party. Give me a call. I'd love to hear from you. Later. MAURY (ON PHONE): Pamela, it's Maury. Remember me? I'm your agent. Young Rascals. MAURY (ON PHONE): What's the story? Grand Funk Railroad, Birds, great records. MAURY (ON PHONE): Give me a call. PAMELA: Oh, I wouldn't they're my dad's. DAVE (ON PHONE): Pamela, it's Dave. Pick up if you're there. Pam, please, give me a call. I need to talk to you. Bye. Mr. Breeding, I have an interview tomorrow and I need some fashion advice. You see, my character, she's very alluring and sexy. And I was wondering, should I wear the jacket open or should I just take the jacket off? Do you want to get hired or arrested? Well, what do you think about the fabric? Nice choice. DAVE (ON PHONE): Pam, it's Dave again. Pamela, come on. Pick up the damn phone. What about the skirt? Is it too tight? [MUSIC PLAYING] Well, how are you feeling? Oh, great. Yeah? I'm going to join you in here. I'm gonna get in here with you. Oh, no. You're beautiful. Aw. No, baby, you're wasting your time. It died and went to heaven. Oh, come on. No, no. I gotta get to work, anyway. Let me out of here. No. No, I have to be out. Oh, that's nice. Oh, I have to go. I have to go. Come on, let me go. I gotta go. Come on, I want to see the show. So just tell me. Am I crazy, or what? You're not crazy. You don't know what you're talking about. It sounded great to me. Oh, it was incredible. No wife, no job, no responsibility, just Pamela and me. Whoo, I wanted it to last forever. Well, it can, buddy boy. You can have regular doses of forever. Are you getting her anything? What? Carl, it's Christmas. Are you getting her a present? Jeez, I didn't think about that. Well, look, don't get her anything too fancy. Don't forget, she's just a hobby. Well, thank, you Ms. Manners. All right, look, when are you going to see her again? Tomorrow night, I hope. She's going home to Topeka for a couple of days. Topeka? Where the fuck is Topeka? I don't know. There's only three Beatles left. Coincidence? I think not. There were five Osmonds. There were five Jacksons. One band really sucked. Anyway, it's a mad house at work. I can't afford to take any more long lunch hours. I don't know. Maybe I should bail out while it's still safe. Safe is for boring old men. Don't you start that shit. Hang in there. Right. There are the same letters in Santa that are in Satan. They both wear red and black. Have you ever seen them together? Coincidence? I think not. Oh, now to go home and try to look like I just didn't screw my brains out. I think you lose. OK, I think, whoever wins the next one wins the whole game. I think I won. You did. I'm gonna get you for that one. I can't wait. You're up early. Oh, good morning, honey. Yeah, I'm just doing some exercises. You hate exercising. Well, yeah, but it's time for change, you know? I mean, I have to start thinking about my health. Hm, good for you, honey. Thank God you could stop by today, Edward. Nice to have a professional restaurateur as a friend, huh? Christmas is such an awful time of the year. Oh, don't say that. How could you say that? Christmas is a time for miracles. Well, my shopping is all done. That's a miracle. Hello? Hi, honey, I'm going to be a little late tonight. Oh, Hi, Carl. Not another one of those late night fillings. Don't these women know that you have a life of your own. It's not that. Eddie and I are going out to dinner with friends. You and Carl are going out to dinner? Oh, oh, I forgot. Oh, yeah, we're going to do some male bonding. Oh. All right, well, have a good evening. Carl, this is so sweet. No distractions. Oh, wow, it's from Sexy Secrets. Uh-huh. I can't wait to put it on. You didn't have to do this for me. Oh, it wasn't just for you. [KNOCKING] Who is it? It's David. What? - Oh my god. - What? Oh my god. What? Oh my god, come on. What is he? Psycho killer or something. No, come on, come on, come on. Wait, wait a second. What's going on? What? Wait. Get under the bed. Get under the bed. Get under the bed. Get under the bed. OK. Wait. - Don't worry. Don't worry. Does he have a gun? Get under the bed. Come on. Wonderful, just wonderful. David, what are you doing here? God damn it, why won't you talk to me? I'm busy, David. You have to leave now. Doing what, huh? With who? And what's this, huh? Give me this. Yeah, well, whoever it is is a real fucking pervert. Come on. It's time to leave. No, not until I kick the shit out of this guy. David! Get out of here, you prick. You're a dick. That's it. We're through. Now, get out. I would have killed him anyway. Well, get out. Who was that guy? Ex-boyfriend. Well, he ought to learn how to express himself a little more. Well, he thought I was his girl. Where were we? We were about to satisfy the cravings of a pervert. [GLASS BREAKING] [ALARM SOUNDING] What was that? That's my car. That asshole. Is this the way 20-year-olds really live? Shit. Oh my God. Hey, get away from there. Hey, look, I don't want any problems, OK? Just get out of here. This old fucking guy? Just get out of here. Hey, leave him alone, David. David, leave him alone! I hate noise. Cut all this noise out. What the hell is going on here? You all right, man? Hold it! Hey. Hey, what happened here? Oh, a jealous ex-boyfriend slashed my friend's tires. They ought to put him away. He's a psycho maniac. He sure got your tires good. Look at that. OK, what's your name? Pamela Atkins. Yours? Well? Uh, look, it's just flat tires. Let's just forget all about this, OK? Hey, listen, you said you want to put him away. Let's do it. I was just speaking in the heat of the moment. I understand where he's at. Hey, hold it. I'm a cop. And I want your name and a license right now. The dude got away. What's the deal here? The guy won't give me his name. Sir, can I just talk to you for a second? I'm really not supposed to be here tonight. Can we just forget this ever happened? This is Christmas time, you know? A man should be home with his family. I know. I know. But just give me a break. Oh, yeah, you want the other guy put away? You got a lot of nerve. Hey, we're out of here. I'm sorry. What? Does this mean we're not gonna see each other anymore? You kidding? And miss another evening like this? I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you when I get back from Topeka. Can I use your phone? Yeah. Well, what did the police say? Well, there wasn't much they could do about it. When they got there, the vandals were gone. I'm glad. What? Why? Because if you had caught them in the act, someone might have hurt you. I'm here. I'm fine. We've been so distracted lately. Oh, baby. I miss you, too. I miss you so much. Mm, I missed you. [MUSIC PLAYING] What is this phone number? It's Hollywood. It must be a client. I didn't know you had any clients in Hollywood. Look at this bill I found in your pants. Your car wasn't vandalized in Encino. It was towed from Hollywood. Eddie and I were feeling silly. He took me to this strip he knows in Hollywood. What was I gonna tell you? I thought you'd think I was a dirty old man or something. You've never been to a strip joint in your life, Carl. And what is this? Lingerie from Sexy Secrets. That was supposed to be a surprise Christmas present for you. Really? Which one is it, Carl? Huh? Which one? It's at the office. What's going on? What do you mean what's going on? You know what I mean. Nothing. You're jumping to a ridiculous conclusion, Anne. Am I? You stay out late at work. You start exercising. You walk around, you're like some lovesick teenager. Your imagination is going wild. No, I'm going wild. There's someone else. Leave her or I'm leaving you. EDDIE: What a pisser. Yeah. We were getting along better than we had been in months. I felt like I was falling in love with her all over again. Well, do you think she knows for sure? Yeah, she definitely suspects. Are you forgetting how I met Anne? I was fooling around on my first wife with Anne. That's my pattern. Anne was so beautiful. I mean, she's still beautiful, but she was so sexy and fiery and new. I guess that's what I see in Pamela. You know, new isn't necessarily better. No, definitely not. Anne is better. I don't want to loose her. You won't lose her. Don't worry. Oh, wait a minute, you told me to remind you to pick up Pamela today at the airport. Oh, hell, I can't. I can't deal with it. I have to concentrate on Anne. You want me to pick up Pamela? If you want, I'll do it? Could you? I mean, could you just look after her? Yeah, I could. Great. Well, you know, you shouldn't be doing it anyway, the condition you're in. No, no, no, no, no, Listen, I mean, Anne is a wonderful woman. Anne is a treasure. The weird boyfriend, the crazy neighborhood, who needs it. Not you, no sir. Now, come on, let's go. If I could just make love to her one more time. Thanks. Eddie, I really appreciate you coming to pick me up. Well, Carl was real upset that he couldn't make it. Yeah, things are pretty bad at home, huh? Yeah, they are, real bad. You know, this is awful. I can't even call him. I feel like doing something. I just don't want to sit at home. Yeah, you really want to do something? I'd like to do something, too, if you'd like some company I'd be delighted. Yeah? Yeah. Come on. [INDISTINCT SPEECH] EDDIE (ON PHONE): Hi, this is Eddie. I'm not home right now. So that's too damn bad. Shit. You'll have to call back again. Bye. Eddie, this is Carl. Where the hell are you? [MUSIC PLAYING] Come on, I hate to dance. I'm not such a good dancer. You know, Pamela is a great dancer, too? Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm glad you two had a good time, Eddie. Come on. She's got incredible energy. She's also immature and flaky. She'll outgrow that. By the way, how are you and Anne doing? Ah, OK, I guess. It'll take some time. I have to let her know where I am every minute so she knows there's no one else. You know, Pamela has convinced me to do my stand-up act. Yeah, that's the kind of girl she is. She's a real inspiration. Well, does she ask about me? All the time. Great. Well, you are married, aren't you? Yeah, I'm married, Eddie. Come on. Come on. Come on. Good evening, boys and girls, and welcome to Tod's world, where things are just a little different. In Tod's world, girls between the ages of 16 to 19 like to sleep with fat balding guys for no apparent reason. It could happen. Hey, how you doing? TOD: Hello. In Tod's world, you go to Disney Land, when you go there, they have sexual fantasy world. And you go there and Snow White's skirt is hiked up above-- - How are you? Nice to see you. TOD: --her waist and all the dwarves are doing her, even Bashful. Hi, Edward. What's going on tonight? A surprise. Eddie, a moment of your time. Eddie, she's here and Anne's here. Are you nuts? She's way in the back. She's not going to see her. She doesn't even know who she is. What are you worried? Well, you better be right about this. Don't worry. TOD: It's the contoured chair. Have you ever been in a house that has one? Coincidence? I think not. There are the same letters in Santa that are in Satan. They both wear red and black. Have you ever seen them together? Coincidence? I think not. Hi, I'm a shop teacher. I've been teaching shop for four years. Thank you very much. And now, boys and girls, it's my pleasure to bring out a gentleman who is normally the manager of this nightclub. He's a comedy virgin. So please be gentle. Please welcome, Eddie Manning. Come on, give him a big hand now. [APPLAUSE] Hello, everybody. Do you like Pepperidge Farm Cookies? You ever see what it says on the box? Feeds four to six people or one fat slob. [LAUGHING] Do vegetarians eat animal crackers? Are you practicing safe sex? I am. The other night I boiled my penis. I had a fight with my girlfriend. I told her, I said, look, let's kiss and make up. Tell me those three magic words that make me walk on air. She said, "go hang yourself." I went to a photo store the other day. It said one-hour photo. I went down the block, it said half-hour photo. I went further down the block, it said 15-minute photo. Next place I went to, the guy said, forget the photo, here's a mirror. [LAUGHING] That's it. I give up. [APPLAUSE] How are you guys? Very good. See you in a second. Hey, Eddie, congratulations, man. You did great. You did great. Thank you. You were wonderful, Edward, just wonderful. God, I felt like I was floating. Yeah, good work, Eddie. You've been dreaming about doing this for such a long time. What made you finally do it? Well, this friend of mine, she said it perfectly. She said, you don't want to feel old and feel like you missed out on something. Yes, there seems to be a lot of that going around these days. Well, I gotta go. Thanks for coming, Anne. You too, Carl. Yeah, see you, Eddie. Ooh, baby. Eddie, you were great. Come here. I'm so proud of you. If you don't stop that I'll knock you out. Edward was great tonight, wasn't he? Yeah, he was great. Oh, no, honey, I forgot my wallet at the club. I gotta run back there. It won't take long. [MUSIC PLAYING] Signorina, After dinner, spumoni. Ah, veal Parmesan. Fettuccine. Bravo, bravo. Signorina, Pamela. Roy. How you doing? How are you? Hey, it's good to see you. Oh, it's so good to see an old friend. I'm so sick of this phony accent. You gotta come by more often. I see you got a new boyfriend. Yeah, Carl, this is Troy. I mean, Tony. Hi, Tony. Nice to meet you. Yeah, likewise. Nice place. Yeah. Good to see you. Listen, I gotta get back to my customs. Scusi. Ciao. Anyway. I know Eddie's been filling in for me for the last couple of days. Wasn't he great the other night? I mean, I knew he would be. Yeah, yeah, he's a prince. Pamela, listen, what I'm trying to say it-- ah, forget it. Carl. What? People are looking at us. I don't care. I don't know anybody here. I missed you so much. I missed you, too. I missed your style. You know, you always make me feel like a lady. You make me feel alive. I just wish we could-- I wish we'd met under different circumstances. Well, we've got what we've got and that's good. So let's just keep it that way. Yeah. [MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] PAMELA (ON PHONE): Hi, this is Pamela. I really want to talk to you. So please leave a message at the sound of the beep. EDDIE (ON PHONE): Hi, cutie, it's me Eddie. Just confirming Tuesday. Ooh, I can't wait to see you and get my hands on that reckless body. I didn't tell you to screw her! What's your problem? You betrayed me, my best friend. What do you want from me? You practically dumped her in my lap. Find anybody that'd spend five minutes with girl without getting a hard-on. Hey, I don't need any more of your help. Go someplace else to get a hold on. Pamela's mine. So you're never going to talk to your best friend again. That's right. Carl, I don't care that he couldn't get tickets for "Phantom of the Opera." It's not like it's the end of the world. Yeah, well, I really wanted the tickets to Phantom of the Opera tonight and he screwed it up. Well, you're just going to have to kiss and make up. Because I want dinner tonight to go well. You invited him over to dinner? Carl, he's your best friend. Oh, no. Oh, stop acting like a child. [KNOCKING] Hi, Edward, how are you? Hello, Anne. Come on in. Nice to see you. You didn't bring date this evening? No, I was seeing somebody and we broke up rather suddenly. Oh, I'm sorry, Edward, and during the holidays. Well, it'll just be our night out then. So where are we going for dinner? Michael's? Mustache Buffet? Well, I know a new place if you'd like to try it. OK, well, you drive. Tony, how are you? Hey, Eddie, good to see you. Ciao. Hey, Carl, back so soon. Hi. You've been here before? Yeah, Eddie took me here, didn't you, Eddie? Yeah, I brought him here for dinner last week. You were here before? Yeah, Pamela took me here. This is our place. She took me here, too. She told me it was our place, too. So how do you know my husband? Oh, he's in here every other night with my good friend Pamela. Oh, really? Oh, great. He's bound to tell her everything. No, I'm in deep shit now. Well, you shouldn't fuck around. Well, here's another nice mess you got me into, Eddie. Me? Yeah, you. Did I put a gun to your head? Oh, you got all the answers, huh? Oh, he's telling her everything. I can't believe it. Who is Pamela? And I'm not going to stand here like some good little wife while you sleep in someone else's bed. Get out, Carl, now. Get out. Now? Now. Tomorrow's Christmas Eve. Now. Want a beer? Yeah, thanks. What a pain to be doing this on Christmas Eve, huh? I've never seen so much stuff. You sure do have a lot of books. Well, I guess I'll have to find a place to store them, huh? Are you sure this is such a good idea? I mean, you moving in and all. Isn't it a little late for you to be telling me that now? I mean, you were so excited about it last night. Well, last night it was just you and me in bed and together. And you didn't have all this stuff. Pamela, honey, wasn't it you that said how wonderful it would be to wake up together in the morning. No more sneaking around. Well, actually, that was kind of the fun of it. Well, now, we can be spontaneous. We can see each other any time, all the time. Sure, great, it'll be neat. Neat? Is that the same as sensational and terrific and great idea? Mm-hm. Don't be so insecure. I'm not insecure. OK. OK. I'm having a little party tonight, with friends over, a little get-together, OK? What? Party. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, how are you? I like that. How you guys doing? Having a good time? You want pretzels? Whew! Whew! Pamela. It's 3:00 AM. Are we going to get some time alone. Oh, we will. We will, babe. Whew! Honey. Hey, there. Some of us are going to breakfast. Do you want to come? No, you go ahead, babe. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. [MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] PAMELA (ON PHONE): Hi, this is Pamela. I really want to talk to you. So please leave a message at the sound of the beep. You have reached Carl and Pamela. Please leave a message at the beep. Thank you. Oh, wow, a tree. Where have you been? Oh, out and about. Did you have a nice nap? Out and about? Carl, don't be such a killjoy. Well, I was waiting for you. I thought we'd do something. Why didn't you just go out yourself? Well, I wanted to spend Christmas with you. Aw, that's sweet. Well, I'm here now. Let's celebrate, pick up a bottle of champagne, cuddle up, watch a movie. Did you ever see "It's a Wonderful Life?" It's a what? It's a very famous old movie. I don't really like old movies. I find them kind of boring. I was kind of hoping we could go out and party tonight. Well, you were partying all last night. Can't we just stay here, just the two of us, nice, quiet evening. I guess older people have different ideas about how to celebrate. You think I'm old? Oh, don't freak out. I didn't mean it that way. Well, I'm just used to doing things a certain way and Christmas. You know? You'll get into it. [KNOCKING] Felicia, you made it. Pammy. Oh. Well, come on in. God, what a city. Getting here from the airport took longer than the whole flight itself. Carl, this Felicia, my friend from Topeka. I told her how much fun I was having and she wants to be an actress, too. Hi, Felicia. Hi. She may be staying with us for a few weeks. Oh. We should get some nice artwork for the walls, too. Mm-hm. And a big screen TV. And a CD player. Damn it, what's wrong with this set. God, relax will you? I just gotta fix it. Turn it on. I thought you already saw that. Well, if you see it, you might learn something. In fact, there's a lot of things you should learn. You're always partying and fooling around. You need to be more aware of things. Look, I am not one of your wedding gowns that you can just tuck and pin and design into whatever you want it to be. I'm me. And, well, I'll learn something when I'm ready to learn it. I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry. You're right. Ah, you're so beautiful. Felicia! Carl, would you like to try something new? What? Well, Felicia thinks you're really hot. Get outta here. Come on, it'll be fun. I mean, come on, haven't you ever wanted to-- Isn't this every man's fantasy? Listen, I don't know about other guys, but I'm not really comfortable-- Oh, come on, Carl. Pamela told me how good you are. What? And you can really get me hot. Wait a minute, you told her what I was like in bed? Oh, come on, Carl. Pamela, I-- I want you to give it to me like you give it to her. I want you to give it to me. Wait a second, I don't think I can do this. I'm just gonna get a drink of water, OK? [MOANS] She never moaned like that for me. Oh, what is she thinking? That I'm an old prude, that's what she's thinking. Let's all go out tonight. What, now? It's after midnight. That's when all the fun starts to happen. Don't you want to? Well, if you can stay up all night, so can I. OK? That's not the right dress. Do me a favor, send that back. I don't like that size. Carl, darling, you'll never believe it-- - Hi. - I met the man of my dreams. Well, that's great. And I need the perfect wardrobe for a trip to go away with him. - I want to hear all about it. - Mr. Breeding. - Wait a second. [WOMEN SPEAKING OVER EACH OTHER] Just wait a second! Hold on! [LAUGHS] I'm gonna help everyone. Just give me a second here. I just have to catch my breath. Carl Breeding, you take this dress back! You made me look so ugly that he walked out of the church! Ms. Fester, just take it easy. I am gonna die an old maid. I'll take it back. And it's all your fault! So what are you doing tonight for New Year's Eve? Nothing. I'm just going to stay home and relax. [CHATTER] [MUSIC PLAYING] Stevie? Stevie! What are you doing here? I came with a friend. Look at you. What are you doing here? Come out in the hall. I can't hear you here. Steve, what are you doing here? I came with a friend. What are you doing? Well, it's New Years Eve. I'm partying. Can't you tell what a good time I'm having. No, I mean, what are you doing? I'm making up for lost time. I'm grabbing all the gusto. Hell, I don't know what I'm doing. If you were me, you'd be giving you such shit right now. What do you think I'd be saying to me? Oh, something along the lines of grow up, take some responsibility for your life. Sounds familiar. See? I actually remember some of the crap you fed me when I was a kid. You don't belong here, dad. You had your fling. You found out what you were missing. Now, go home and find out what you've got. [SIGHS] Strange advice from the kid who has a different girl every time I see him. You know me, dad, I'm just passing the time till I find the right one. Mom's alone tonight. Happy new year. Happy new year, dad. MAN: OK, let's have the countdown. Here we go. Everybody count. [CHATTER] ALL: Nine, eight, seven, six. five, four, three, two, one! Happy New Year! [CHEERING] Hey. What! Happy new years. Same to you. Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING] I came to wish you a Happy New Year. Thank you. Happy New Year to you, too. I made some resolutions. Do you want to hear 'em? I've made a few myself. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING]
