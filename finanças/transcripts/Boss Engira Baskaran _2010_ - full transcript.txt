The man running in the streets with a sickle to kill... ...his name is Baskaran. Everyone call him as Boss. Who is running after? What had really happened? Few months earlier... The city of temples and ponds, Kumbakonam is Boss'native place. He's Saravanan, Boss' elder brother. Don't imagine he's some terrorizing villain travelling on Bullet. He's very soft type like hero Murali of film 'ldhayam'. He's a Veterinary doctor in Thanjavur. His only problem is though nearing middle age, he's still a bachelor. Greetings brother. How are you? - l'm fine. Cow has delivered a calf, l've brought sweet made from biesting milk. - Take it. - Very good. lt's all your lucky hand. There's nothing in my hand, it's all God's grace. Watch out, l'll oversee the next delivery too. You're helping cattle but you still remain a bachelor. - Take it. - Brother. Did l ask you? What bothers you if l'm married or not? There are many in the city unmarried, go and ask them. He gets furious if anyone talks about his marriage. Her name is Nithya. Boss'younger sister. Studying B.A. Economics final year. She wants to become a TVcompere. Look at her, how she shake her head while talking. l feel Ajith must act in Hollywood films, what's your opinion? Yes, definitely. lndeed, because he has the right personality. She's Sivagami. Boss'mother. Baskaran has no father, his mother is everything to him. Her most important duty for the family is... Pray to God...pray to God... pray to god! He has named his saloon smartly as 'Thala and Thalapathy'. He's our Boss' only friend. His name is Nallathambi. Change the blade. Lord Ganesha! Whether crops grow or not when it rains, every one must grow long hair. l must cut and earn well. lf TR decides to shave his beard, l must give him the shave. Give me knife! Like Vadivelu had a story in inheriting the bakery shop in film 'Giri', Nallathambi too has a story behind getting this saloon shop. Groom ran away from marriage after knowing my daughter is pregnant. Would he stay back to deliver the child? Let him go to hell, useless man. You were the only one with a smiling face in the marriage hall. For that? You must give a new life to my daughter. Go man...go... Are you trying to register a second hand bike used by someone else to me? Go man! Wait...if you marry my daughter, l'll give my saloon to you. - Saloon? - What do you say now? He liked the deal very much. Play the band! To say about Boss in two lines like Thirukural, he's busy all the 24 hours, but he'll not do anything. Boss! Boss...boss...ask my name, boss... Boss...boss...my name is Boss... Boss...boss...ask my name, boss... Boss...boss...my name is Boss... Unemployed but always busy... When we play cricket, temple tower is the boundary line... Nobody every asked me if l'm a good man or a bad man... Boss...boss...ask my name, boss... Boss...boss...my name is Boss... We'll wake up early morning at 5 am... Jump into river Cauvery from the rock... From 8 to 10 am, we'll hang out in bus stop with a smile on face... Spend the afternoon in the saloon... Eat on loan from the push cart food seller...

From 4 to 5 pm, we'll hang out in college... We act like good boys... We'll regroup again in theatre at 6 pm... After the film, we go on hunt for a quarter bottle... Boss...boss...ask my name, boss... Boss...boss...my name is Boss... Boss...boss...ask my name, boss... Boss...boss...my name is Boss... Unemployed but always busy... When we play cricket, temple tower is the boundary line... Nobody every asked me if l'm a good man or a bad man... Boss...boss...ask my name, boss... Boss...boss...my name is Boss... Boss! ls she here only? Saw her face early morning, l'm finished. Father, you must save me. Hey VlP! Exam? lf you fail in your English exam this year also, it'll be super, we both can write the exam together next year. She has started it. Please, fail this year too... please... l'll not get tensed for this. This time l'll definitely pass. l'm terribly hungry. - Mother, let's have breakfast. - Wait son. l'll come. Copy or do something to pass this year. Unable to show my face in public. Losing honour. lt's already gone. Confirmed, it's gone. Yes...yes...it's going every year. Anyway please check and give me a call. Okay...okay... Brother... lt's not big deal to take bits to exam, you must pass exam by copying those bits. Okay, l'll drop you. l haven't eaten anything. - No use in writing exam, useless. - Mother, bye. You'll feel sleepy if you eat and go, drink this and go on. - Mother, please have this too. - You're right. Have lunch after the exam. Taunting me? l'll pass and then take on you. Okay. Bangles are reciting poems... Cool gentle chill breeze is blowing across... My heart is pounding and my body is thrilled... - Young maiden... - Brother! Why are you standing there? Empty seat is there, sit. What a lousy life! My bit! Where has it fallen? My life is in it. Please find it for me. Don't know where is it? God! Find it for me. Excuse me! - ls it yours? - Yes...yes...give it to me. Thank you very much. You've given me a new life. lf l had lost it... l shudder to think. Did you read it? What's there to hide from you? l'm going to write arrear paper, l'm taking 36 bits. Nobody can find it. 3 bits are inside my brief. This main bit has all the information about other bits. Forget all that, what do you do? Thought of flattering her, but they never give us any chance. l'm going to write arrear exam, best of luck... Pardon? Pardon?! Passengers to Arts college get down. Why are you following her like the Hutch dog? Buddy! lf you had told, wouldn't l've come to drop you? l'm going to write arrear exam, if l go with you, it's proving unlucky to me, l'm failing every time. Buddy! You're unlucky to me. Leave me. Buddy! You wouldn't mind if l tell you something, right? Even if Goddess of Learning herself drops you, you'll not pass. Making fun of me? What else then? lnstead of copying, why are you bothered about astrology? Go man! l can't leave you so easily. This time you'll fail again, you didn't drop me this time, that's why l failed, if not l would've topped the state and won gold medal, you may say all this. l'll not give you an opportunity to say all this. Come...come...come l say... So, you don't want me to pass and become Collector of Kumbakonam. Okay, go. Enough, come. lnstead of taking bits to exam, if you'd taken blouse bits and sold them, you'd have opened a shop like Naidu Hall. How do you fail in exam inspite of taking bits? Buddy, l get confused every time where l've kept which bit. This time l've a special bit with information about other bits. How is it? Practice make a man perfect! What did you say buddy? Practice make a man perfect, so said Swami Vivekananda. No external force can fail you in this exam, buddy! Boss! How are you, Boss? lt's 6 months we've met. We met in the last arrear exam. Looks like you've put on weight. Look, how much weight l've lost! Diabetes? No, full diet control. l'll lose more weight by next arrear exam. You must also lose some weight, because we are getting old, right? Who is he? Your uncle? Who is he? Your crony? lt seems he has taunted me! Just for fun, don't get angry. l'm Venkat, Boss' arrear friend. Friend? Oh God! He looks like a pumpkin with a tie. Nice meet you. l've so much to talk to you, come Boss. lf l knew l would be meeting such a man, l wouldn't have come. Forget about the exam, Boss. Leave it. - An important news. - What? - l've released a new edition. - New release? Four months. lt's a boy. Look there. Have a whale of time. He's boasting as if he has released 100 billion Avatar. Leave it buddy, would everyone get it free like him? Boss...what are you telling him? He has twins, come let's meet your new release. Come. lt's vacation for kids. They were torturing me to take them out on picnic. Writing arrear exam is like picnic, right? That's why l've brought them here. - Are you married? - No buddy. Next time you must come to write arrear exam with your wife. One must marry at right age. You're writing arrears form Gandhi's time, don't talk about age. l'll slap you. Have milk. - How are you? - l'm fine. - Will he pass atleast this year? - Definitely. All the best. - What's that? - Milk. - Last night you would've had it. - l slept off. Old man, poor man dozed off. Friendship! What's our next plan? Family planning for you. l didn't ask you, what's our next plan, Boss? Why are you building up like scientists who sent rocket to moon? Both are dullards who have come to write arrear exams. Bell is ringing, go else they'll make you kneel down, Go! Go and fix a machine. - From now we are not friends. - Why? He's like elder son of Adam and Eve, if he's your friend, who am l? You've brushed it aside so easily, it's 5 year old friendship. Friendship from heart is friendship not that's on face value. ls your friendship an example of that Kural? God! Give me strength to bear any number of arrears. Boss! Why are you keeping bits? Get lost! Don't pass the exam, l'll be left alone. - Shut up. - God! Fail him. Hi! Super! Bit! Caught! Escape! What am l to do now? Pass it. - Pass it. - l'll try, madam. - l told you to pass this. - Paper? Take it. Oh! my bit! Front pocket, sleeve neck, left side shoulder, right side shoulder, pant pocket, brief...

Madam, he's copying from the text book. What's this madam? You're not allowing to copy from bit or book, what do you think of yourself? How can l pass the exam? Get a degree, join a job, marry and have kids. Pardon? Pardon! Always repeats the same word. What think you? ldiot...stupid...nonsense. You country fruit. Degree no...marriage no, children no, matter no. l complaint principal, name tell...tell name...tell...tell. Come on...come on... Pardon!

Though in a crowd, she's distinctively separate... She's a walking flower... She has done something with me... l asked earlier, who is this girl? Later l realised she's my better half... When l look at her, she looks elsewhere... When l don't see her, she stares at me... She smiles at me but refuses when l see her... She acts truly false...

Next time when you see her, sing a good Tamil song. - Okay. - Wait. - Sing a song for sample. - Do l've to sing? Hail Lord Siva... You fool! Singing that eat the girl alive. Will you sing this for a girl? Sing a romantic song. - Romantic? - Okay? Excuse me...one minute. Only thing, l tell. New sari, beautiful... very very beautiful. - Pardon? - Song? Kiss me to light fire... Didn't she like the song? My head is reeling... l'm swooning on seeing you... When you come near, l'm scared... Excuse me... what are you trying to do man? You were going on asking me to sing. That's why l sang. Pardon doesn't mean l'm asking you to sing. l didn't get you what you said, come out more clearly. You've spoken in Tamil now.

Forget about him, how did you say it? How did l say it? l don't think you're beautiful. l never felt like falling in love with you. But l fear all this may come true, bus left before l could complete it. l told you to say like Madhavan in film 'Alaipayuthey'. You've delivered it like Rajkiran of film 'Aranmanaikkili'. Who will dare love you? Don't shout on me. Buddy, everyone has his own style. l can do what is possible for me, right? My bad luck to ask advice from a two kid father like you. Hello...hello...one minute. Excuse me. You said l'm not beautiful and you don't like me. - Why are you after me then? - Missed the timing. Did you see film 'Alaipayuthey' on TV? l too watched it.

Did you see how fast he is? - What did you say your name is? - Baskar, brother. Tell me brother. - A boy l know... - Yes brother. - He has failed 10th class. - Sorry to hear. Admit him also. Brother, you're helping us with money, won't we do this to you? - You send the boy, brother. - Send if there any girls too. To make them study well. Take money and start the work immediately. - Buddy, you take it. - No, you take it. You must take it. Your hand is lucky hand. You take it and give me. One minute, sign this agreement and take the money. He lends money after taking auspicious thread, was waiting why he hasn't asked anything? Sign it. - Do you've any property? - No brother. - l must earn it hereafter. - Give it to Nallathambi. - Me? - Sign wherever he shows. He'll show back while taking bath, shall l sign there also? Go! Why are you talking among yourselves? Sign it. - Brother, that is... - My life, buddy. l've dug the ditch for myself. Give water to the buffalo, look it's shouting. Don't wait for good omen.

Did you tell about our grandpa to the new teacher? l'll tell. Grandpa? He's my father Murugan. My father was the first man to study 10th class in my clan. 10th class is common exam, to pass it he had an idea. Who are you two? Two people are sitting together. He's my teacher, instead of me writing what he had taught, if he writes, it'll be better, so l've brought him here. ls it wrong? l was smarter than my father. l went to write 10th class exam learning five words. Those five letters were, pass me else kill you. My son, lion cub! He dozes off if it's silent. Exam hall is silent. He sleeps there. lf you wake him up then. Though not educated, you're running like a factory with few henchmen. Nothing, they take loans, but never keep up their promise. All are frauds. That's why l've employed them by signing agreement like you for 2 years. Those people cleaning the dung are mostly teachers like you. All are dullards. That's why l've made them clean the dung. Why are you standing still? Come. Tell your friend and get my son to pass the exam. lf he fails, l'll take your shop and drive your family to streets. l'll make you also clean dung. Dung? Because you signed the document. That's the rule. Please get my son through somehow. You will do it. Take the vehicle. To repay gratitude... joining the wrong side... You got betrayed, Karna... The betrayer is Kannan... The most benevolent heart will never die that's the rule of God... What to do? l warned you not to sign it. You didn't listen, it's all your fate. Go and clean the cow dung. Wittingly or unwittingly you've caught the tiger's tail. lf you release the tail, tiger will eat you. Why are you calling me respectfully? Why are you saying l've caught it? You're saying it'll eat me, why are you saying as if l'm stranger to you. - We both signed it together. - lt came in a flow. We caught it together, it'll eat both of us. We can manage when it eats. - What are we going to do now? - We are doing. Let's do something really big! God! Save my family from going to streets. Buddy, don't trust God, trust yourself. l'm God! - Look who is here! - Greetings sir. Who is he? - He looks like a cookie seller. - He's our tutorial teacher. My old classmate, very intelligent. All the useless guys are joining together, will my tutorial college succeed? Sir, if you pay advance... You want pudding before brushing teeth. l'll pay after cutting the ribbon. - Okay sir. - Buddy, we'll cut the ribbon, right? - Are you fine? - Welcome brother...greetings. - Why all this? - Please accept it brother. Am l late? No brother, just now l came with sweets, mixture and ribbon. What? Sweet and mixture! Look how my son is running! Don't feel sad for cutting the ribbon and running in. My son is very lucky. l brought 15 buffaloes after he was born. lf you give birth to Yama, you've to buy buffaloes only. What Nallathambi? Your son is indeed very lucky, let's go in. - Bless me, l'm like your son. - Move! Baskar, you're very fortunate. Though if anyone seizes his shop, even if his family comes to streets, My family coming to streets, why are you announcing often like train arrival in station? Truth must be said, Nallathambi. You must be very lucky to have such a friend. Yes brother. He has taken such a great risk for you. Brother, don't think l'm saying it arrogantly, taking risk to him is like eating rusk. l don't know if you eat rusk or kuska, get my son to pass. lf not, you remember, right? This Onida head is scaring me too much. The way he's eating bunches of bananas, l feel elephants will come to petty shop for bananas. Baskar, tell the teacher to take lesson, l'm feeling sleepy. Take lesson before he sleeps. How can l spend my energy and knowledge on one student... You asked advance, right? Take your advance. Don't stand next to him for long, he may eat you also. Take lesson. Listen carefully, have tea. Singing! No new admission today? - Ask the one to leave. - No problem. Today is first day, we must progress gradually. Listen to our friendship song.
