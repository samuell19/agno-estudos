Attention please. TWA flight number 820 from Hong Kong has landed one half hour ahead of schedule. Passengers are deplaning at Gate 3. Announcing the departure of Pan Am flight number 538 leaving for New York. Passengers please proceed to gate 4. Thank you. Japan Airlines flight number 18 has just arrived at gate 20. Thank you. Mommy! Go right on in! May I help you? Eggs. Eggs. There. Announcing the arrival of BEA flight number 704. Thank you. Waiter? Tang Lung? Miss Chen Ching Hua? Yes. Why not waiting for me at the exit gate but running around? The plane arrived early. I was hungry so I went and grabbed a bite. How is my uncle in Hong Kong? He's a bit unwell, so I came instead. He wrote me about you but didn't go into details. How can you help me? Please don't stand on ceremony. I'll personally help you. Personally help me? You know my problem? That you must tell me in details later. But first, now please tell me where the toilet is? Precious horse (BMW)? Wild horse (Mustang)? A flying horse? Dad died last month and left me this restaurant. Uncle Wang and the others have helped out a lot. Business wasn't bad in the beginning. Then a huge syndicate stepped in. They're interested in our land and wanted me to sell the restaurant. There's no sale without mutual agreement. If you refuse, what can they do? In theory, you're right, but they won't listen to reason. They'll do anything for getting my land. They hired some young thugs to watch the place day and night. If a customer comes in they simply drive him away. What am I to do? Why not report it to the police? They disappear when the police come. We can't ask the police for round-the-clock protection. Business has gone down badly and I still have to pay my workers. How can I go on meeting the expenses? The thugs have become worse lately demanding an immediate answer. So I wrote to my uncle for help. I thought he'd send a lawyer, but... You are welcome. I told you not to worry. I am here to help. Don't worry, Miss Chen. It's nothing, I can take care of them. Look up there! That's their headquarters. Please sit down. I rent this place. It's more convenient living here because all the men live at the restaurant. There's always a spare room. If any of the workers get sick, they can come here. It is crowded in the restaurant. You can stay here for the time being. You're my uncle's friend, so please feel at home. Let me know if you need anything. May I use your toilet? It's over there. Chinese New Year is coming up. Everyone in Hong Kong is happy and celebrating. Do they celebrate it in Rome? I haven't been back to Hong Kong for more than 1 O years. I think it's changed a lot. I may be a stranger when I am back. Oh, yes. How's the restaurant business there now? I live in the New Territories and seldom go out of town. I practice martial arts every day. Restaurants haven't changed much. Take a seat. Here's the key. Our telephone number and address are all on it. The restaurant is nearby. If you get lost just show that card to a taxi driver and any taxi driver will bring you back. Taxi? It's too expensive here. Are there public light buses? Do you need some money? No, I brought some with me. Better put it in a bank, it's safer that way. No, it's safer to carry it by myself. Much safer than carry it by others. I won't argue. How much did you bring? Not much. Really, not much. I still say it's safer in the bank. Come on! Miss Chen! How are you? This is Mr. Tang. He wants to deposit some money. Ah, my friend! How much do you have? Take it out now. This way. How much you want to change into our currency? How much local money will you change? Only $20. Lately the exchange rate has been bad. There $20 will do. That was the bank manager not a pickpocket. You must be more polite. Not everyone you meet is a villain. Not everyone you meet is a pickpocket. Besides, I know that bank manager. Foreigners are warm and passionate. They also quite friendly. When people smile, smile back. That's politeness. When someone puts an arm on your shoulder it's a sign of friendship. You should react the same way. Remember my words and no need to be so uptight! Sit down. Make yourself at home. Ah Lung. You must be Ah Lung! Welcome to Rome. I'm Ah Kun from Miss Chen's restaurant. Brother Kun! Miss Chen has returned to the restaurant after a long wait. She asked me to take you there. By the way, where were you just now? Let's go! Uncle Wang, Ah Lung is coming. Ah Lung, this is Uncle Wang. Uncle Wang. Have a seat! - Ah Kun, make some tea. - OK. It must have been a long and tedious flight. How do you like it here so far? I'm certainly not used to things yet. Doesn't matter, you will, as time goes on. It's been a long time since I was back home. How are things in Hong Kong? Hong Kong? I live in the New Territories and I seldom go out of town. Have some tea. Come, have some tea. Why there is no customer coming to such a big restaurant? Ah Lung, with those thugs around, who'd dare come here? Ah Lung, there are more workers training out back. Let's go meet them. There's no business so they spend their time exercising. Come on! Before Mr. Chen passed away, they learned karate to handle the villains. Why didn't you take it up? I'm not interested in foreign martial arts. It doesn't matter what style if you can use your body well without limit even in the midst of violent movement to honestly express oneself. I prefer Chinese boxing. Do you know Chinese boxing? Yes! Really? Let's take a breather. Come here. This is Tang Lung. Introduce yourselves. My name is Tony! Jimmy! Thomas! Robert! I've no English name. Call me Ah Quan. Brother Quan. Come on... He looks like a coach. Have you learned any boxing? Ah Lung came from Hong Kong to help us. He's an Chinese boxing expert. I'm just a novice. Chinese boxing? I understand it's like dancing. But it sadly lacks power? You lack power when you haven't mastered the fundamentals. Right, how then do you develop power? By uniting the waist with the stance. Will you demonstrate how to unite the waist with the stance? I'm afraid I'll hurt someone. What are you afraid of? They're wearing protective padding. They won't get hurt. We've guests coming. Change the clothes and get to work. Hurry! Come on, let's go. Change the clothes and get cracking! Brother Kun, where's the toilet? Over there. It's labeled in English. Get the hell out of here. Now. Come on! Get out! Why? That's why! What's your decision? Uncle Wang! Come quick, they're here again! Stop it! All right! If you don't send a reply tonight, don't blame us for getting rough. Please help us out, Mr. Ho, put in a good word for us. Give us a few more days to think it over. You've been delaying a long time. Are you not selling? Why do you fight? You fight. Don't fight please! We'll only wreck our own things. Remember, you must send a reply tonight. Let's go! Sorry! Be careful next time. You don't even know a word of English. Why did my uncle send you here? Ah Lung, they're young and headstrong. Don't blame them, everything will be all right. Lucky that they weren't armed today. In broad daylight? They wouldn't dare use a gun in public. If Uncle Wang hadn't stopped them, I'd have used karate on them! You can talk! What good is your karate? It's still better than Chinese boxing. People shove you out of the way. And you even apologized! Sit down, please! Sit down, please! May I help you? May you help me? Sure! I'd like some Chinese spareribs. Chinese spareribs? You mean to tell me you don't know what Chinese spareribs are? Well, let me show you! What are you doing? You know what we are doing, don't they, fellas? You all should have left this restaurant! Brother Kun, get Uncle Wang out here to help. You two come to help. Stay calm. Don't wreck our place. It's no use. You want to step outside? Sure! Good! Ah Lung, you? Jimmy! Jimmy. Jimmy! Chinese boxing? Damn! They know nothing! They think this is Chinese boxing. If I knew Chinese boxing, I'd give them a good taste of it! I'll go! Tell him this is Chinese boxing. Hey! Chinese boxer! The Gold Dragon Fist No.4. "Little Dragon Asking for Direction." "Big Dragon whipping its tail!" Ah Lung, bravo! Magnificent! Excellent! Don't be overjoyed. There'll be more trouble after this. With Ah Lung's skills, those men dare not think twice now. You don't understand. Powerful outsiders can hardly afford to neglect local bullies. This is their territory. We are under their control. We must be careful. Let's be more patient. More patience! Man, our Dragon is here! You'd be wise to heed my advice. Is that so? Calm down, everyone. Ah Lung, it's late, you must be tired. Let's turn in. Want some supper? No, I must get up early for training. Go to bed early. I hear it's easy to buy a gun here? Yes, any local citizen can get a license. What are you doing? Making darts. Darts? What is it? What to do? Want to eat? You can eat if you're as good as Ah Lung. Better go practice your karate! Is it for Brother Lung? Why didn't you say so earlier? Brother Lung? Brother Lung... Good morning, Brother Lung! Good morning, Brother Lung! Brother Lung, I made this especially for you. Eat it while it's hot. Your kung fu is terrific. Who was your teacher in Hong Kong? Look at this! "Little Dragon Asking for Direction." "Big Dragon whipping its tail." With that, all the enemies are down! You said Chinese boxing lacks power. I was only kidding. Brother Lung, you were too fast yesterday. We couldn't see clearly. Will you show us again? Please show us. Go on then! OK, come on. Brother Lung, come on. Everyone says you're fast and powerful. I didn't see it last night. You said power can be generated by uniting the waist with the stance. How about a demonstration? Be quiet and let's watch, okay? Let's watch together. So, shut up! Step back! Are you all right? Everything all right? Fantastic! Brother Lung, will you be my teacher? Will you be my teacher? You said practicing martial arts is useless. So why are you doing it now? I never liked karate. But this is Chinese boxing. Can you dig it? We'll give up karate. Let's learn from Brother Lung. Right! Customers! Come quick! Coming... Change your clothes! Brother Lung, oh no, my teacher. I am going to take care of the customers. We'll talk later. Miss Chen, is there anything for me to do? Watch out for those villains. They may come again. My boss wants to see you! What did he say? He wants us to see his boss. Shut up! Now move! See you tomorrow. All of you are good for nothing! You! Didn't you have a gun? What I like, I get, and I want that restaurant. Yes, boss! Yes, boss! Yes, boss! Yes, boss! Haven't you wasted enough time? But I always do my best. Then how come you failed? I found out that they are helped by a man called Tang Lung. A man? Only one man? But this man knows Chinese kung fu. Kung fu? Good morning, sit down. Eat please. It's hard to find this in Rome how does it taste? It's not as good as in Hong Kong. I cooked it. It's all right. And you? Want some more? I'll take you around Rome later. Wait! Go on! Move, move, come on! Where's the man from Hong Kong? Tell him to come out. Where is he? Talk! I don't know. You'd better talk! All right. He'll be back soon. Where is he now? These are Rome's famous relics of the past. Over there it is... what is it? Our slum is full of these wrecks. Please. This garden... A king built the garden for his queen. It took a lot of time and money. They must have been really in love. Are you married? How do you like the palace? Such a big place is a waste. In Hong Kong, I would build a skyscraper and collect rent. We'd better return to the restaurant. Close the door. You better cool it, baby. Bring him down! Chinese kung fu? The boss means well. We all come out for a living. He appreciates talent and he knows you're strong. Oh, what rippling muscle! We don't want to harm you. Here's a ticket back to Hong Kong. Better to stay out of trouble. All right! Take him out, but be careful with the gun in public. Yes, boss. Come on, let's go. Go see if anybody's around. Put your hands down. Put your hands down! Listen! Listen! Boss, that bastard got away! Go! Get him, but no gun! Get him! Let's get him! Get him! Let me get him. Get him. Get him! Mama mia! No need to like this. Miss Chen, quit while you're ahead. You'd better say yes. We intended well. We're offering you a good deal. What do you think? Hello! Tell him. We don't want any more trouble, or else I will retaliate. He told us not to come and cause any more trouble. Move them out. Hurry up and pick up everybody. Ah Lung, hold it, those are customers. Welcome! Come in please. Welcome! Serve our guest properly. Tang Lung must leave Rome before 12pm, otherwise a gunman for him. See? I told you to be patient. You should bear the responsibility for this. What should we do now? We'll fight to the end. This is no joke. I know, but... I know how you feel, but we must think of Ah Lung. They'll do what they say. You mean... Keep him under cover for awhile. Tomorrow is Lunar New Year's Day. If there's trouble then... I don't know if he'll agree? I know he's stubborn. You must persuade him. Without him, we'll be forced to sell the restaurant. We'll have to see. We may have to cooperate. But we mustn't sell the place. Let me decide. All right. Better go and talk to Ah Lung. Is your restaurant open tomorrow? Good. We'll go to the countryside and practice. Remind Ah Kun to bring the protective padding. Firecrackers? It's banned in Hong Kong. There must be Chinese living nearby. You must leave Rome for awhile. Leave Rome? Don't misunderstand. We don't want you to go. Especially me, but you must leave. Do you understand me? I don't understand. Ah Lung, why won't you... Are you afraid of fire crackers? I'll take you to the airport. - Why? - Those men want you... My duty is to help you. I know, but you must leave. They intend to kill you! Kill me? Who? Time's up. Let's go! It's too noisy. I'll close the window. Stay here, don't move about. Miss Chen! Miss Chen! Hello! May I help you? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Three five. Hello, what was that Sir, can you please repeat that? Hello? Hello? Hello? Miss Chen, don't waste time. Here's the agreement of sale. Sign it. No! Why be so stubborn? The boss has been nice to you. If this knife crosses your face, you'll look ugly. Agree and sign. So don't make our boss mad. I won't sign! It's for your own good. No matter whether you sign or not. We'll get the restaurant sooner or later. Tang Lung will soon be here. Tang Lung? You think he will come? Tell you, he go to hell already. Be careful! The mastermind is over there. You're crazy! - Let me tell you... - He doesn't understand Chinese. I think of a wonderful way to handle that Tang Lung. Which is called, do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Well, among my friends, there is one Japanese martial artist and one European martial artist. They are both strong, but the problem is that they're from different styles. I'm afraid they might not cooperate with each other. Money will buy cooperation. If money is not a problem, then I suggest we must call America for Colt. Is this Colt good? Is Colt good? He is America's best! You better pray that you don't fail this time. He will beat Tang Lung. I'm willing to bet my life on it. Operator! I'd like to call America. Yes, A-me-ri-ca! Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Here you are... thank you... Here you are... thank you... Thank you, Uncle Wang... I didn't expect traditional lucky money abroad. Uncle Wang gives us lucky money yearly. This is my best New Year ever. First, we successfully defended our restaurant. And second, we have Brother Lung with us, who's also our teacher. Third, we finally beat the hoodlums. Good day today. Let's enjoy the new year and skip the violence. Here comes Ching Hua. Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Come, this is for you. Thank you, Uncle Wang. Ah Lung, a cable for you. It's from my Uncle. He wants you to go somewhere to help someone. Don't be like that I'll be back. I won't leave until the whole thing is settled. Happy New Year! Beautiful decorations indeed. What a warm gathering. What do you want? I came to bring greetings. It was our fault. I must apologize. We must all be friends. Our boss would like to see Mr. Tang. Have a talk in person. Would he do us the honor? Wonderful, this is good beginning. Business will be good this year. Tell your boss we'll be there. Meet in the Empress Restaurant tomorrow morning. Bye-bye. Oh, no. Please! Please, stop it. Both of you. - Damn it! - Oh. Oh, no. Please! Listen to me. Oh, please. We are friends. Tang Lung is our enemy. Please wait for our boss to come back to decide which one of you will take care of that Chinaman, OK? Stop! Sensei! Bob's my student. He will be the one who will personally take care of Tang Lung. Yes, boss! Who can do karate better than the Japanese? Now that we have decided. - Is everything arranged? - Yes, boss! First of all, I'll meet them at the Empress Restaurant early tomorrow morning. You're here. Sit down. Sorry our boss couldn't make it today. What's going on? Sorry, something urgent came up. My car's outside. I will drive you to meet him. What? We're to go to him? Never mind. Take us there! Right! I like straight-talkers. Let's go! Where is he? He's gone. Forget it. He won't get away. It's a trick. Be careful everyone! Leave it to me, Teacher! The three of us can handle him. I'll go first. You? Tang Lung? Tang Lung. Are you Tang Lung? Are you Tang Lung? Leave it, he's already surrendered. Ah Lung, we're lucky this time, not to have fallen into their trap. Tang Lung, come if you dare! Ah Lung, don't let him get away. Tony and Jimmy can take the Japanese. Tony, are you all right? I'm hurting all over. Uncle Wang, why... Don't blame me. If you must, blame it on Ah Lung. Yes, Ah Lung got you into this mess. He should not have get in my way. You... what do you mean? What do I mean? Working men have no future. I have worked hard for half my life but I own nothing. My wife and children are waiting in Hong Kong. If the restaurant cooperates with them, they'll pay me a big reward. Then I can return to Hong Kong, and enjoy luxury. You should understand my difficulties! Tang Lung, you've got guts. Tang Lung, the man you just saw will kill you. Tang Lung, you're at the end of your road. You're at Death's door. Ho! Mr. Wang, we've failed. Hold it! We've been tricked. Tony and Jimmy... look! Don't get emotional, please! Listen to me, Mr. Tang. Boss... All right. Hands up! Don't move. Okay. Let's go. Now that it's over, I must go. I'll see you off. No, Ah Quan has a car waiting for me. Take good care. In this world of guns and knives, Tang Lung is respected wherever he goes!
