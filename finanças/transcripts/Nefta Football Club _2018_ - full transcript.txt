Still nothing? What can that asshole be doing? Did you do like I said? Yeah, I did like you said! I stuck the headphones on its ears, a little slap on the ass and there you go! Of course. It’s the first time it does this to me. First time. We're gonna miss the game. To hell with the game! Riyad Mahrez, best striker in history. Bullshit, Messi’s the best striker in history! Anyways, they all take dope. No, not Mahrez. Why do you think he runs so fast? How can you say that, you never saw him play! He’s the best! It’s out! Why do you take the ball? It’s out! No it’s not out! It is, there’s a corner! Let me get off, I want to piss. Too late. What’s too late? You gotta stop, I tell you. Ok, only if you say Messi is the best. You can’t do that! It’s blackmail! Say Messi is the best and I’ll stop. Stop it or I’ll jump. Hurry. Where are you going? We've got more driving to do. I am gonna piss in Algeria. If you cross the border, I’ll tell Dad, you’re gonna get it. I don’t care, I’m gonna piss in Mahrez's country. He’s driving me crazy with his Marhez. Hama! Hama! Look what I found in Algeria! What are you doing with that? Did you see what it had on its ears? It was chilling, listening to music. Leave it. Bring it back where it came from. It must be somebody’s. Somebody’s? You see somebody here? It’s totally awesome! Cut the shit and bring it back. You suck, I’m telling you to put it back. C’mon, give me the headphones! C’mon! Get your ass over here! What’s the matter? What is it, flour? Put it in the cart! Hand them to me. Is it laundry detergent? Yeah, right... Hurry! You’re spilling it everywhere! Open your eyes! If Dad finds out we stole laundry detergent, he’ll kill us. Listen. Keep your mouth shut, don’t tell anyone, ok? What do you wanna do with all this? C’mon and shut up! I haven't slept, haven't eaten. Two days we’ve been looking for this fucking mule. We won't sleep until we find it. Maybe customs caught it? Or maybe it got lost? Impossible. Not if it hears Adèle. It’s automatic, it comes home. What? Adèle. Adèle. "Someone like you". What? What’s the matter? I put Cheik Hadèl on. What? Did you put Adèle or Hadèl? I told you Adèle, shit! I never said Hadèl! I put the first track I found on the MP3. I don’t listen to that stuff. A donkey won’t make the difference. Are you totally stupid? It’s been trained like that. It crosses the border to get his food. It's been conditioned by Adele's music. Ever heard of Pavlov? If I don't know Adele, how should I know Russian singers? I just know the guys from the hood who sing "Chaabi". Stop! I swear Salim I didn’t do it on purpose. Who can take care of you like mum? Mum’s sleeping, she musn’t hear us. Go get the bag. Gently with the bags. Take it easy. Gently. Shut up, Mum’s asleep. I’m exhausted. Are you deaf or something? I told you to shut up. I don’t want anyone hearing us. My feet hurt. What are you doing? Nothing, go to sleep! Where are you going? I'm going into town. I’m coming with you. You stay here and don’t move. Understood? The spool is gone. Change it. He left you money. Buy a new one. Hello guys. Hi, got another problem with your moped? No I got something to show you guys. No time to play. We’re busy. What the fuck are you still doing here? Just have a look. What is it? Just look. What is it? Taste it. Where was it? In a garbage can. Where? In my neighborhood. You sure? Yeah, I’m sure! Two million. Two million? Two million in a garbage can? 500. You got it! I got a whole bag full at my house. You wanna see? I swear on my mum's head, I swear it's true! C’mon, you got nothing to lose! I swear, I am not lying! Where do you live? Near the mosque being renovated. You sure? C’mon, you’ll see, nothing to worry about. Come on! You sure you’re not playing us? Is it far? We’ll be there soon. How big is the bag? Hey guys! What’s this Abdallah? Laundry detergent we found in the mountain. What for? Here! Take it! What do you wanna do with it? I’ll tell you. This way. Where’s the bag? I don’t get it. I had hidden it here. I’m sure they were here. I thought there was only one. I better not see you around, Or I’ll strike you. Come over here! Hurry up. Come on. Where’s the white stuff? What? The laundry detergent. It’s here. Where here? We made the lines with it to stop arguing. No more fights about corners or throws-in. Come on guys, let’s go! Come and play!
