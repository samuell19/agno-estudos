Thank you. A bit of champagne! Have you been here before, Julie? It's my first time. Oh, this is your first time here? Lebel, you've been had. Could we turn the lights down? -Of course. -Thanks. Damn! What is this? Shit. It's a camera. -What? -It's a camera. Did you know there was a camera? -A camera? -You know what a camera is? What camera? -What's this? Where's it from? -I have no idea. Are you trying to blackmail me? Who's paying you? You think I'm a sucker, you bitch? I didn't do anything! It wasn't me! -You didn't put the camera there? -No, I didn't know. -Give me that! -I'm calling Favan. Favan? Give it to me. You're not calling Favan! -Stop! -You're not calling Favan! -Victor? -Sir? We have a problem. 820 for DL820 Alpha. We have a car on fire on Victor Hugo in Chatou. Are you available? Patrol DL820 Alpha, we're on it. We're finishing up a stop, and then we'll go. Did you call the fire department? Help me. -Sir? -Yes. She's not dead. -What do you mean she's not dead? -She's still alive. What do I do? Call for help? No, especially not the emergency services! What should I do? Help me, please! Help me, please. Sir? Do what you have to do. There's no other option. "Do what you have to do." "Do what you have to do." Good one. Station 820 to all available personnel, we have a report of a home invasion in the Carmelite residential area. Is anyone nearby? -Hello? -Yes, sir. The cops are on their way. I have to go. -No, wait! -I don't have time to take the body. -You... -Yes, but I can't stay. -I don't have time. I have to go. -Victor! -You're not going to leave the body? -I don't have time. Sir! Your briefcase. Thank you. Time passes slowly. It passes slowly when I'm far from you. If Paris were a woman, I'd be jealous. -Coffee? -Yes. Livy made French toast. Time passes slowly... Charles. Dad, are you OK? Went down the wrong pipe. I was trying to say that time passes slowly when I'm far from you. EVERYONE LIES As I told you last week, I won't sell you The Black Dahlia if you haven't started the Lloyd Hopkins trilogy: Blood on the Moon, -Because the Night... -I don't want those. I want The Black Dahlia. You can't tell me what to read! If you want to meet Ellroy, if you want some kind of connection, you have to read -the trilogy! -OK. Give me the trilogy and The Black Dahlia. I'll read both. No, read it first and come talk to me next week. You're crazy! Maybe I would sell you the Los Angeles quartet. And then you can start The Black Dahlia. See you next week. What's going on here? I'll help her. God, he's annoying. You messed up my organizational system again, huh? Hello. -Officer? -No, prosecutor. -Alice Mojodi. -I'm not a cop anymore. There are lots of cops out there. 149,700 of them. Mr. Verner! The Minister of Justice and the Minister of the Interior agreed to set up a special task force to specialize in sensitive cases. Sensitive cases is the polite way of saying shitty cases, right? No, it's for cases that involve people with enough power and money to cover up their crimes. People are tired of the double standards. Mr. Verner, that's where you come in. I need an asset. An asset. You're not looking for an asset. -You're looking for a fuse. -No! You hate lying. That's why you were fired. I'm counting on your desire for revenge. Even in detective stories, there's no finer motivator. You've been put in charge of this group? I earned my place there. You're a woman, young, wearing cheap clothes. -I'm sure you're a scholarship kid. -I hope you have a point. You're an advertisement for the Ministry of Justice. Great, so no one will be suspicious. -You don't give up, do you? -No! Does this sensitive cases group have its first case? Yes. -Fine... -No, no. -Please. -I said no! No. Please, I need your answer within 24 hours. Because yes, I'm interested in you, but I have other candidates in mind. Just read it. Don't tell me it doesn't interest you. You were a good cop, Vincent. I'm not saying that to flatter you. No, you're saying that because it would piss you off to have gone out on a limb for a bad cop. You can't spend the rest of your life in my bookstore. You're driving customers away and screwing up the police's procedural section. -Are you firing me? -I never hired you, Vincent. And I've never paid you. You know what? This is all just hot air. Well, use it to start a storm. We used to call you the hurricane when you were arresting guys. What? You're losing it. I'm telling you. We go out, and I say, "This is Inspector Verner," and they'll say, "Yeah, the hurricane." -Hello? -Yes, hello. -It's the hurricane. -The hurricane? Vincent Verner. You idiot. It's been forever. No, it hasn't. It's been... two years. Do you know anything about a group called the Sensitive Cases Unit? Can Malory and Julien help you? No need. So, Julie. Who got you into this mess? So, we have a possible murder, but the case is closed in six days. Smells fishy. Can you imagine the kind of pressure that took? Smells fishy. I don't like him. I guess you've made up your mind already. Yes, we have. You got fired for not giving up on a case involving a politician with a lot of protection. Your superiors asked you to keep quiet, which is obviously not your strength. Reprimands, hard to manage, six-month leave... I was talking about the investigation. -Did you have a breakdown? -No... Isn't this information supposed to be private? Yes, but Malory is very good at what she does. -We're just taking stock, huh? -Yeah. So, we found two cameras. One up there and one on the ground. They transmit via Wi-Fi, but I don't know to whom yet. When you secretly film someone getting off, it means you're blackmailing them. Who owns the villa? That's where it gets complicated for Saulven Industries. Saulven. That's the car manufacturer, right? CO2 EMISSIONS TURNOVER -And run by... -Charles Favan, friend to politicians and campaign contributor. You guys are going to get trampled. OK, Verner, let's move on to something more productive. Yeah, so the blood was cleaned to remove any evidence, but the body was still here, which tells us that they were caught off guard. A neighbor called the 17th at 11:32 p.m. to complain about the noise. I killed someone! The first villa is 63 paces from here, and the second is 129. No one is close enough to hear anything. The guy who called must be that one who spent the night with Ms. Casteran. The suspect? Yes, you're right. It is strange. Because when someone calls the police, it's out of guilt, remorse. We don't have just one suspect but several suspects with different intentions. Yeah. So, how do you want to approach Favan? De Grève! -You're from a fancy district, right? -Yes. He's having a reception at his house in two days. He's passing it off as a professional event. It's on his birthday. With my contacts, I'm sure I can get an invitation. We'll be able to get closer to the target and get to know his entourage. Too much work. I can get into his laptop. I just need Julien to stand next to him for 30 seconds. So now you want to abandon protocol and hack his computer? Well, abandoning protocol is going to have to be your bread and butter. We've got nothing, except that he owns this villa. Isn't crossing the line the reason you came to me? Take it. I can't. I'll call you a taxi. Wait. Mrs. Casteran, -my condolences. -Thank you. Is your life's mission to mess with my organizational system? It's crazy! No, Higgins Clark can't go after Dantec. No way. I'm putting your coffee here. What's up, Malory? Julie Casteran's body was cremated yesterday in Paris, even though her mother had expressly requested she be buried in Toulouse. The body should have been sent there, untouched. Hmm... Max, this is Malory. -Hello, ma'am. -Nice to meet you, sir. Doesn't seem to bother you much. If Mrs. Casteran's last wishes weren't respected, it's because there are people who had an interest in it. Well, you were right about the call. The call to the 17th precinct came from a prepaid phone in Paris. Ah. Why did you put Simenon next to Vargas? Why? Because they are novels in which the character is more important than the investigation. -Maigret, Adamsberg... -Yes, maybe in your own library, at home... -But you know... -Yeah, fine, understood. ...in a business, you use alphabetical order. It's about being practical. Anything else? Her father died in 2013, and she was an only child. But she had a roommate, Samantha Mayeras, a childhood friend. Well, let's go. -Need a ride? I have my car. -What time is it? 45% of accidents happen in cities between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m. I'll take the bus. I don't like him. Do you want a coffee? I just made some. He really can't work with a team, can he? -Yeah, but he's a good cop. -He left without the address. Hello, Verner. Do you want the address? -So you just became an escort? -Out of necessity. Living in Paris isn't cheap. I studied for a master's in law to become a lawyer. Julie studied for a master's in international business. She did an internship at Saulven. Favan noticed her quickly. She started going with him to meetings and then parties. -Do you want sugar in your coffee? -Yes. She brought me a long sometimes. In one night, I earned the equivalent of a month's salary. But I stopped. If I want to be a lawyer, I can't run the risk of running into a former client one day. Yeah, and then... -Do you need help? -I'm fine. So, Julie's last client, did you know him? No, he was just someone Favan wanted to make happy. That's it. Julie got paid a lot of money. -A lot? -A lot more than she's used to. -For sex? -Yes, it's a possibility. Escort doesn't mean whore. Yes, it does. She was earning more money, like you said. No, it was the first time, and I told her not to do it. I won't let you judge her. Everyone judges everyone. It's the first thing you do when you meet someone. Your pants, my tie, your social status. It's a reflex. It happens in seconds. I can see her, scared to death. What? I can see her getting into that car, scared to death, with a stranger. Her mother was having money problems. It was getting to her. Do you know what prostitutes on the street do when they're suspicious of a client? This is the license plate number of the car that picked her up. The cops never asked for this? What cops? No one came here? So, we're neighbors. OK. Come on. Hey, cut that out! Vincent Verner, I work right on the other side of this wall. This is drywall. This can't happen. I'm sorry. I'm Isabelle, and that's Tom. I'll take care of it. Don't worry. This is usually a quiet place. Then I should warn you that he might do it again. What about you? The... -Tom, stop! -Give me the ball! Listen, there's... there's a basketball hoop on the corner. If it would help, we can go play. Please. Please, Mom, I want to play. You can see it from your kitchen window. You can watch us. Mom, please, I want to play basketball. Give me the ball. Wait, we have to wait for your mom to say yes or no. -You're wearing pajamas! -Is it OK? -Yes. -OK. -I'm not going to do you any favors. -Don't worry. It's every man for himself. -Are you sure that... -It's fine. If he's mean, you yell. I'll be watching. -You talking about him? -Of course. Thanks. LIBERTY EQUALITY FRATERNITY Hello? There's a Mr. Verner here for you. OK, tell him I'll be right down. -Is it much further? -You'll see. I asked for somewhere discreet, and that's what we got. Yeah, this is clearly a departmental priority. Well, we're cops, not interior decorators. Favan and his little intern. A year ago, at a car show. He can't say he doesn't know her. But he can always deny that he was paying her. I checked the license plate of the car that picked her up. Is there any connection to Favan? -No, it's an OTE car. -Oh yeah, OTE. What's that? It's the Ecological Transition Office. It's part of the Ministry of Ecology. The manifest at the garage wasn't signed. They say it happens sometimes. Maybe the cars are equipped with GPS trackers. No, that would be too easy. They're used for private reasons, so no trackers. The car was taken out, but we don't know who drove it. Or where it went. Yes, so we have a vehicle from the Ministry of Ecology on one side, and on the other, Saulven, a major polluter, managed by Favan. The whole thing is just as twisted as we thought. -Anything else? -Yes. The mother, widowed eight years ago, works in car company cafeteria. I checked out her bank accounts. Her daughter was giving her 600 euros a month. Did she know where the money was coming from? -Let's ask her. -Let's go. She's still at Sam's. -This way, Verner. -Go ahead. I'll follow you. How long have you had your license? -I mean, do you drive well? -Why? Because I'm a woman? No, because 45% of accidents happen in cities. Yes, cars are dangerous. By the way, I sent you your contract. Take care of it if you want to get paid. We just have a few questions, Mrs. Casteran. Your colleagues never told me what she was doing at that villa. Your daughter may have been murdered, Mrs. Casteran. Verner! You can't say things like that! She has a right to know. Mrs. Casteran, I have a bank statement here that belongs to you that shows that your daughter transferred 600 dollars into your account every month. This is a transfer from your daughter into your account, right? Yes. That's a lot of money for a student, isn't it? Do you have any idea how she earned that money? She told me she had a waitressing job. -A waitressing job? -That's what she said. -Is that right? -Yes. Yes, a student job in a nightclub. Julie's dad was buried in Toulouse, right? That's right. And you wanted to bury your daughter there too? But you changed your mind? You had her cremated in Paris. Why did you change your mind? Huh? How much? How much did they pay you to speed things up? How dare you. What? Nothing. I was at the morgue identifying the body. That was the first time I saw him. -Who? -He made me sign a release. He said he'd help with the funeral. Two months ago, I was still working. I cleaned houses and the cafeteria. The money Julia sent me was just for paying my mortgage, that's it. And he... He offered to pay for everything. He told me that if I had her cremated, it would be easier to bring the body back to Toulouse. Who is he? Mrs. Casteran, who is he? Can you describe him? He's tall, dark, strong, -old... -Old? Yeah, old, like you. He works at Saulven, where Julie did her internship. -Thank you. -I can take her ashes to Toulouse. -That's the important thing, right? -That's right. -Waitress in a nightclub? -What would you have said? -The truth. -Oh really? What about the number of pigs who touched her? -You think that would help? -What do you know about it? What do you know about it? Oh yeah, you think there is only one truth? You can't see that her only truth is pain? I forgot my glasses. I have to go back. No, it's OK. I have them. Hey, open up! Find your own way! I've already started hearing about your new... -Sensitive Cases Unit. -That's right. That's a good sign. It's too bad I had to hear about it from someone else. It's been over a year since you mentioned your work. I know you're disappointed in me. No point adding to it. I never asked you to do ENA. I always knew it wasn't for you. Well, anyway, what can I do to help? Uh... Please. Do you know Favan? Saulven Auto. Yeah, I have a few clients who do business with him. I don't know what you're looking for, but don't mess with these guys. That's exactly what we look for: men who think they're above the law. Favan is celebrating his birthday tomorrow, -and I was wondering if... -If? ...if you could get me an invitation. Honey, cufflinks: gold or silver? Gold. It would have been nice to celebrate your birthday alone together. You still love me? Proof, always proof. You have to show it. -Sir? -What? Sir. Yes. Reopened the investigation? Who? The Sensitive Cases Unit? What the hell is that? OK, but why haven't I heard of it? I don't care! Find out! You're my lawyer. That's what I pay you for. Shit! De Grève, this is Sam, a friend of Julie's. She'll be your date. Hi, Sam. She's used to these parties. So we're just trusting her now? No, but we're taking her to meet the big bad wolf? What do you want me to say? This is crazy. -Yeah, it is. -Yeah! We're not asking her to carry a gun, just to dance. I know how to dance. Yeah, but we need an escort. Someone who looks like an escort, I mean. I don't see him. How much do I owe you for escorting me? Whatever your price is. I've got him. Let's go. Anything for the good of the business. Working on it. Give me 30 seconds. Happy birthday. Thank you so much. Excuse me. -Madam Minister. -I'm in. DOWNLOAD IN PROGRESS Don't get too far away. Madam Minister. What a wonderful birthday. DOWNLOAD PAUSED Sorry. Julien, I lost the connection. No reason to hide it either. And it's not my style. Good evening. The forest is usually silent when the hunters are out. You know I don't like hunting. OK, I'm reconnected. -Damn! -What's wrong? Old friend. Sam! -No. -Don't you recognize me? -No! -It's me, Francois. -Ten more seconds. Don't move. -We don't know each other. -Yes, we do. -Let go of me. My dear Francois, I have a business proposition for you. I hope you don't mind, young man? -Of course not, sir. -Very well. DOWNLOAD IN PROGRESS And never without consequences. DOWNLOAD COMPLETED Got it. You can go. Sorry! -Excuse me. -That's OK. Happy birthday, Mr. Favan. This is a wonderful party. Magnificent. -I was an escort, not a hooker. -I think he got that. OK, I have his calendar. He's meeting with future partners tomorrow at Kaplan's house. Depending on your orders, we would speed up the pace, of course. And you would be... -Who are you? -Who do you think? Excuse me. Let me make things simple for you. Yes, it's a Saulven house. Yes, I know the victim. She was an intern. I asked her if she wanted to work as an escort. Escorting is not illegal, and I'm not interested in your moralizing. And yes, I paid for the victim's funeral. Perfectly logical. I can afford it. She can't. Well, her family can't. Admitting everything so that I don't ask any questions. Smart. No, truth is good, if you're innocent. Could you tell me which client little Julie spent her last night with? I have no idea. Julie was a regular here. She had the entry codes. I have no idea whom she spent the night with. Whoever altered the crime scene and tried to make the body disappear, he also had the codes. What crime scene? There was no crime. The police ruled it an accident. I hope you don't doubt the quality of your colleagues' work or of my sincerity? No, sorry. No, wait, you're trying to frame someone, right? I'm just trying to figure out how this works. An escort for each contract, and then, if the client backs out, you have everything on camera to blackmail them with. Is that it? That's it. That's a lot of accusations and not a lot of evidence. How tall are you? -Six feet tall. -Yeah. They need tall people to work traffic. A couple phone calls from me, and you'll be back there. I never said I was a cop. Get this big idiot out of here. No, wait! Wait one minute! It's fine. Let me go! -Yeah. -No, wait! We have a bit of a problem. Good job, bad boy! You blew it, killer. SECURE CALL He's calling from an encrypted line. What kind of encrypted line? ACCESS DENIED TOTEM Totem, the ones the government uses. To take the call, you need the phone that goes with it. Favan is calling someone who wants to stay under the radar. We've got a new player. The owner of the Totem phone. -Let's call him Totem. -How imaginative! Let's turn up the heat. Ma'am, a courier just dropped this off for you. I'll put it on the table. Calm down, Helene. Calm down! Honey, this isn't my first time. Don't worry about it. Yes, of course I'll tell you but not on the phone. I'll wait for you tonight? What do you mean you want to sleep alone? Breakfast, then? Yes, me too, honey. This guy is trying to throw me off my game. What're you drinking? Cucumber, ginger. Your daughter made it. Apparently, it's good for the liver. Put your phone away, sir, -and use the encrypted one. -No, that's what guilty people do. Stop talking on the phone. No, I can't change my habits. After all, I did nothing wrong. I didn't get rid of her. Put down my daughter's bullshit and taste this plonk. He doesn't talk like a cop. He doesn't act like a cop. Who is this guy? Yeah, well that's something that people didn't know, that Maigret loved to eat. BRUNO CREMER Oh, it's Cremer. And? Cremer is under-appreciated. Sean Connery would have made a good Maigret too. -Are you waiting for someone? -No. Good evening. Sorry to bother you. I have a huge problem. I need help with Tom. -No, I can't tonight. -No, it's not about now. Then we can talk about it later. I just wanted to ask you... I have a friend over, and no one likes cold pasta. -We're watching Maigret... -Listen, I just wanted to ask you if you know a student or someone because I have a big presentation tomorrow, and the schools are closed because of a strike. I'll be gone for two hours. I can't leave him alone. -I'm sorry. I don't know anyone. -Does your son like books? Yes, he does. Police! Hands up! Come in. One of my officers was just assaulted. I know that some people are bothered by our work and there are questions about it. I want to know who. Are you yelling at me, Madam Prosecutor? Mr. Prosecutor, excuse me. You'll know when I'm yelling. Right now, I'm just angry, -OK? -Alice, you knew what you were doing, right? Whoever is asking questions is getting them from someone else who is getting them from someone else. Even if I ask, I'll never know where they're coming from. Favan is trying to find out where we stand. If our apartments are no longer safe, neither are our offices. I want a place to work and for the address to be kept secret. OK? OK. I imagine you've found a place? Not me. Verner. DIOGENE BOOKS One more signature here. This is for the Ministry of Justice. A whole month. That's a lot of cops in my space. Here. This is for you. -Thanks. -I'll take care of this. I wanted to tell you that you totally have the body of an escort. The donut would have sufficed. Who wants coffee? Of course I'm irritated. I feel like you're blowing me off. You remind him who funded his campaign, who is creating those jobs. It's simple: if this investigation goes too far, I don't think you'll be happy with what they find. Mr. Favan, I'm going to make a call. We're going to figure it out. We're not in the habit of letting our friends down. It's about trust. I'll be in touch. Was he reassuring, sir? You're kind but remember your place. Here. A German competitor gets pinched. Three billion in fines in Germany, two and a half billion in Canada. That's just the beginning. The trail of fraud starts leading to Saulven, and it's suddenly the ideal moment to release me. -What do we do, sir? -I don't know yet. But I'm not going to Lebanon stashed in a suitcase. We're going to protect ourselves. Hello, Franck. This is Franck Ducret. He has worked for the past five years in the pollution control department at Saulven. He was in charge of monitoring the carbon emissions of the motors. Last year, Favan tried to fire him twice, and both times, he lost in court. Three days after the last judgement, Ducret was attacked. His house was searched. The cops declared it a burglary gone wrong. A week later, he resigned from Saulven. Was Ducret the one they were trying to trap at the villa? He married his partner in 2015 then divorced, so catching him with a woman wouldn't do much. Are you OK? Am I boring you? Ducret called the Ecological Transition Office 60 times last year, without much success. His calls never lasted more than ten seconds. Then suddenly, last month, his call lasted 25 minutes. Who owned the car that Julie Casteran was picked up in? The Ecological Transition Office. Pollution control and the Ministry of Ecology. It fits. That means that Ducret and the person who they entrapped were in contact. So, we just have to talk to Ducret. He'll give us the other guy, who will give us Favan. They're like dominoes. And we won't have to question everyone at OTE. We'll pay Ducret a visit tomorrow. Mr. Ducret? It's open. We can't, Verner. -We don't have a warrant. -What? It's our only lead. Mr. Ducret! It's the police. We're coming in. We can't go in. We're coming in. It's the police. Don't be so furtive. We're just taking a look. -I'm not being furtive. I'm... -Go look upstairs. No one uses that word correctly. Furtive means sneaky. -You're the sneaky one. -OK, go look... I'm just respectful of peoples' private property and protocol. Mr. Ducret! Is anyone home? Mr. Ducret? Did you find anything? I'm not sneaky. I do my job. That's it. The sneaky one found something. YOUNG WOMAN FOUND DEAD Yes! Look. -Good, huh? -Yes. A young woman found dead in the villa. Police call it an accident. -What did you find? -Ducret's bank statements. -Hello. -Hello? -Hello? -Yes, hello. Verner? -Malory, hello. -Hello? She can't hear you. It's muted. -Hello? -I'll do it. Hello! Malory, it's Julien. I'm sending you Ducret's bank statements. Yeah, file a subpoena for his bank statements. See what he's been doing the past few days. OK, I'm on my way. -I'm sending you the photo right now. -OK. Kids help you keep going. I lost custody. -End of discussion. -I missed my chance to shut up. Verner, you need to step on it. He rented a car 20 minutes ago. I called the agency. -I'm tracking him via GPS. -OK, we'll intercept him. Good news. Ducret's car has an anti-theft device. I'm activating it. -I'll call the local police. -Good job, Malory! This vehicle has been reported stolen. The car will power down in two miles. Please find a safe place to park. This vehicle has been reported stolen. Shut up! What the fuck? Please pull over. No! Shit! The car will power down in two miles. Please find a safe place to park. This vehicle has been reported stolen. The car will power down in two miles. Please find a safe place to park. Did you run into a door? -Can I ask what's going on? -Hello, Alice Mojodi, prosecutor. Please take a seat. We need you to take Favan down. YOUNG WOMAN FOUND DEAD I don't know what you're talking about. A year ago, they tried to fire you from Saulven. Twice. You go to court, they break into your house and beat the shit out of you. And now, it's happening again. Now, they're forcing you to flee. You think that's the solution? Running away? Some people aren't courageous. And some people don't know how brave they are. Mr. Ducret, look at the photo. I think she's dead because of Charles Favan but also because of what you found out about Saulven. That's impossible to run away from. -Mrs. Casteran is here. -Good. -Hello, Mrs. Casteran. -It's Julie's mother who's here. Mr. Ducret? I'm Julie's mother. I was a pollution control expert at Saulven, and a year ago, without any good reason, they changed our software. And I realized that it was altering the data to reflect lower CO2 emissions. So I wrote a report and alerted management. I thought I would be congratulated. No. From then on, they were looking for... They were looking for reasons to fire me! They succeeded. I quit. But... before I left, I sent a copy of my report to the Ecological Transition Office. To whom? Whom? Nicolas Lebel. I thought that he would alert the Ministry of Ecology or whoever looks into fraud. But nothing. So I called 100 times, and I got his switchboard 100 times. And then, about a month ago, he answered. He said he had thought about it, that he had sent my report to some people but that he hadn't heard anything yet. He suggested it had upset quite a few people. Did he ask you to testify? Yeah. Last week, he showed me this. He told me about his night with... -the girl. -Julie. He was terrified. He told me we had to stop, that Favan had a long reach and that he wouldn't stop. I was scared too. MULTIMEDIA MESSAGE I never saw his face. Yes? It's not going to be a good day for you, Mr. Lebel. I know about the villa and the young woman, so... I'm the only one who can protect you from Favan. That's the good news. Look out the window. Shall we meet downstairs? Making them spit it out. That's what I like best. OK, Julien, all we know about the murder is that the man Julie spent the night with, according to Ducret, is Lebel, and that he may have called the cops himself. You have to play with his emotions, -remorse... -And guilt, yeah. -Guilt, that's... -Verner. I know you would prefer to be in my place, but we need this interview to be admissible in court, and you're not a cop anymore, so you should let me handle it. Excuse me. Childish, don't you think? -Is he trying to take over the unit? -This is no time for cockfights. And I'm the head of the unit. Hello, Mr. Lebel. Have a seat. Do you know this license plate number? It's registered to the Ecological Transition Office. My job responsibilities don't include license plate numbers. This is the vehicle Julie Casteran got into the night you met. Did you know there were cameras all over the villa? No? Because you look good on camera. No. He's making him think we have a copy of the video. This is going to turn against him, turn against you. Mr. Franck Ducret told us about the carbon emissions fraud at Saulven. He wrote a report about it. He says he sent it to you. So, what do you say? You decide to alert the authorities, but nothing happened. We have a record of your call to Ducret. And then Favan finds a way to keep you quiet. Mr. Lebel, you're going to have to talk to us at some point. A young woman is dead. And somehow, you're connected to all this. You're telling me that a guy I've never met told you that he sent me a document that I never received, and I'm implicated in the death of a young woman I've never met? Julien, listen to me, please. Stop. You have to stop and go back to what you know. His emotions. Show him the crime scene photos and try... We found the car you were driving that night. It's in the lab with the forensics team, who are analyzing the GPS tracker. -No! -A tracker? No, there is none. He's lying, and now he's going to get it. And if we discover that that car went from the crime scene to your home, then things are going to get complicated for you. Do you understand what I'm saying? OK. You're right. He's overthinking this. You're right. I met the girl. She brought me to the villa. I spent the night with her. We drank a little or a lot. At one point, she got up from the sofa, fell, and hit her head on the table. Just like that? I don't know. When I saw she wasn't moving and all the blood, I panicked and ran away. When I got back to Paris, I bought a SIM card in Barbes and called the police. I pretended -to be a neighbor. -He's taking all the blame. -I was scared. -He's scared to death. I should have turned myself in. It was an accident. He's not talking about the report or Favan. If you don't want him to be childish, stop treating him like a child. Julien, keep going. It's not that bad. Stop mothering him. OK, Julien, listen to me. That's great, you got him to admit that he was at the villa, but we don't have anything on Favan or the report. So please, go back to what you know. Show him the fucking photos. It's obvious that this was no accidental fall. Think, damn it! You said it was an accidental fall. So, can you explain to me how the lamp, the picture frame, and the broken champagne glass ended up on the ground? That's a lot for a fall. -Don't you think? -All right, fine. So, I think that... I think that you found one of the cameras. -You got me a cop who stutters? -It's stress. You realized that you were being set up, and it got out of hand. So maybe Julie Casteran fell by accident, or maybe you killed her. Move to the victim. Speaking of... The victim. Julien, listen to me. Do you hear me? Julien, we're not auditioning you, OK? Trust yourself. Let's talk about the victim. All that blood you mentioned. I imagine that was the first time you've seen that much blood. I want a lawyer, please. The blood, the blood, the blood. It doesn't fit. Help me, please. What an idiot! I'm an idiot. -Turn off the camera. I'm going in. -Excuse me? Turn the cameras off. I'm going in. I should have realized earlier. It's a drop. Look at this. It's a drop. It's not a trail or a splash or a streak. It's a drop. A drop falls from above. The victim had to be standing. She got up after she fell. I swear she didn't get up. She was lying there, on the ground. That's why I panicked. So she got up after you left. But she was alive. Maybe you're not the one who killed her. The guys who came to finish the job were interrupted by the police that you called. Who are the guys who set you up? Mr. Lebel, that camera is turned off, so whatever you say will stay between us. At the moment, you are guilty of neglecting a person in danger. That's five years. If you continue to protect the people who framed you, you're an accomplice. Now, we're at 30 years. There you go, Mr. Lebel. You need to decide who is more important. Soon, it will be too late. No, but... his lawyers will know it was me. Whose lawyers? -Whose lawyers? -Come on, give it up. Favan. They'll know, and they'll come for my family, me, even if I am in jail. No, not if it's out of court. If the file on the tampered engines magically reappears, through an anonymous source, he'll be fine. You'll be fine, Mr. Lebel. Mr. Lebel, if they are trying to get to you, it's because you still have it. In a safe deposit box, at the bank, at your lawyer's office? No. I hid it in my office. So the girl is dead because of this report? 48,000 people die every year because of pollution. Saulven Automobile generates four billion in sales a year. Imagine Favan sitting on a big pile of money. Makes more sense now, huh? Not really. Police. The keys to Mr. Lebel's office, please. Thank you. EMISSIONS REPORT SAULVEN AUTOMOBILES We can use this report to get at Favan, but we have nothing on the murder. We need that video. We have no idea what's on it. He must have kept it. It's the only thing he has on Lebel. Lebel, who is a threat to his empire. We have to isolate Favan. He'll make a mistake eventually. Should I call him in? -Hello, is this Mr. Favan's office? -Yes, do you have an appointment? He's here! Excuse me. You can't just walk in. Mr. Favan! Hello, Mr. Favan. -This is a summons. -Hey. I was in the neighborhood. You look good! It's good to see you. See you later! Here. Here, Mr. Favan. -Should I call the lawyers? -No, certainly not. It'll make us look guilty. I have every confidence in our country's justice system. Yes. Favan's here. Great, thanks. Yes. Mr. Favan. I appreciate your punctuality. Have a seat. Oh, quite a fall. -No lawyer? -No. Honestly, this doesn't warrant one. What is this anyway? EMISSIONS REPORT SAULVEN AUTOMOBILES Here you are. In effect... Oh, wow. You can imagine that if I had been aware of this report, the safety of our citizens would have been Saulven Automobile's priority. But... unfortunately, I don't control production personally. You may not control them, but you are responsible for them. You know the methods and the results. No, wait, this report implicates Saulven as a legal entity. So Saulven has to answer for this, not me. You will have plenty of time to defend yourself, Mr. Favan. In the meantime, I'm going to refer this matter to the judge for fraud, accessory to fraud, issuing false certificates, and negligence that could lead to serious physical injury. That's great. Perfect. How combative! What flair! It's such a shame that you're no longer on the force. What happened? A nervous breakdown, a case of burnout, like so many of your colleagues? May I have a copy of this report? I'd like to take the necessary measures, be as vigilant as possible. Thank you, Mr.... Mr. who? -Verner. -Verner... I had a geography teacher named Verner in sixth grade. No, it's not funny. He killed himself. Excuse me. Thank you, Mr. Verner. Thank you, Madam Prosecutor. I'm going to search every corner of your life, in every drawer and under every rug. I'm going to question everyone. Your neighbors, your family, your friends, everyone you stepped on to get to this point, everyone you harmed. I'm going to rewind through every minute, every hour. I'm going to trace your every step. I'll be like the fly on your shoulder. And one day, your wife will doubt a memory, some tiny detail, and she'll call me. I'm afraid he doesn't like me much. Your office is very small. How long have you had this job? A month? Yes. Thank you. Escort this gentleman to the waiting room, please. I have a few things to discuss with the judge. -Come with me. -Thank you. Hello? Can everyone hear me? -Yes. -Yes. I can hear you. -I'm going to go for it, you know. -Do you know what -paramedics call motorcycles? -No. Organ donors. Favan is texting the encrypted Totem phone. "Take care of the package." Julien, are you in position? I've got eyes on him. Totem is on the move. I'm on him. Go, go! -Verner, can you hear me? -Yes, I hear you. Totem is heading west on the A13. Looks like he's headed to Favan's. Police! Good job, ma'am. Hands behind your back! Microwave! -Phone. -Here. Go! It's 3:22 p.m. You're under arrest for witness tampering and withholding evidence. We have the video and the phone. It's up to you, Alice. -Mr. Favan. -I've been waiting a long time. If you want my advice, I would strongly advise you to stop while you still can. This investigation is only going to bring you trouble. Please sit down. Thank you for your concern. As far as trouble is concerned, we knew what we were getting into. I'm not sure whether to charge you or take you into custody. Custody. And how do you plan to do that? That's interesting. I asked myself the same question last night. -And? -And Mr. Verner gave me my answer. We're going to isolate Favan. He'll make a mistake eventually. Shall I call him in? Hello, Mr. Favan. -This is a summons. -Hey. I was in the neighborhood. -You look good! -From there, he has two options. Either he'll think we know more about the victim, or he'll think we know why he set up Mr. Lebel. He'll come alone, so as not to appear worried, to show us that he's in charge. Since it's a simple summons, he'll think that we're here just to advance our pawns. When he arrives, I'll give him the report. As it doesn't concern Julie Casteran, he'll feel reassured. He'll hide behind Saulven Automobile, -saying something like... -This report implicates Saulven as a legal entity. So Saulven has to answer for this, not me. The usual thing. And then I'll put a little pressure on him. I'm going to search every corner of your life, in every drawer and under every rug. What will he think then? He'll think that by looking for information about Saulven, we might have come across the video. We leave him alone with his phone. He has the right to it since he came freely. And that's when he will make a mistake. -He'll take care of the video first. -Yeah. He can get out of the pollution story, the financial scandal. Politicians and businessmen never go down for things like that. But murder? That's harder. It's dirtier. You lose your friends. He'll want to destroy the video first. Because if the girl fell, the video will exonerate Lebel, and Favan's in trouble. OK. Let's say he makes a phone call. By the time we know where he's going, the video will be gone. Favan has one man he trusts. Not two, one. One man to threaten Ducret, one mad to do his dirty work in the villa, one man to break into your house. -Totem. -That's right. Totem knows the truth. He called him when I threatened him at the restaurant. So he'll call Totem to destroy the video. If we have Totem, we have the video. This thing is enraging. I collected all available photos of Favan, from professional, public, and private sources. SCANNING And the three faces that appear most often are... LOADING RESULTS ...these three bozos. Do you recognize any of them? -That's the guy from the cemetery. -Hello, Totem. Don't move! Totem's name is Victor Bizien. Gambling debts, banned from casinos, he gets caught during a robbery, and when he gets out, he goes to work for Favan. Favan gets a new secretary every year and a new driver every three months. So, ten years with Totem must mean love. Mr. Verner figured it out. Stop it! Not again with this emissions thing! -I told you what I know. -Mr. Favan! You're forgetting your complicity in the murder of Julie Casteran. The two are linked. That's a serious accusation, ma'am. You'll need more than suspicions. To get me for a murder that is connected to this report, you would need to prove that I knew about it. It can take years for that kind of investigation to get to court. For each of your lawyers, I'll have ten better ones. For each of your witnesses, I will have ten more credible ones. I didn't know anything, and I'm not an accomplice to anything. You don't have what it takes. You'll be finished before you even start. -I have the Totem phone. -Thanks. Sorry for the wait. Chilly, huh? Did you check it? No, I can feel the suspense. A bit of champagne. -Thanks. -Have you been here before? No, this is my first time. Oh, this is your first time here? Damn! What is this? -Is that the lamp? -It's a battery that fell out. It's a camera! What? It's a camera. Did you know there was a camera? -There's no camera! -Did you plant a camera? You know what a camera is? There was a camera here! I don't know what it's doing here! Are you trying to blackmail me? Who's paying you? You think I'm a sucker, you bitch? I didn't do anything! It wasn't me! -You didn't put these cameras here? -No, I didn't know. Who do you work for? Where did you put the camera? -Where the hell is the camera? -I don't know! Who do you work for? You're trying to blackmail me. -I'm calling Favan. -Favan? Oh, you work for Favan? No, you're not calling Favan! -Give me the phone! -Stop! -Let me go. Don't touch me! -You're not calling Favan! Julie? Julie! 820 for DL820 Alpha. We have a car on fire on Victor Hugo in Chatou. Help me! Sir? She's not dead. What do I do? FIRST PHONE CALL No, she's still alive. Should I call for help? Help me. Help me, please. Sir? Do what you have to do. Good one. Home invasion in the Carmelite residential district. Sir, the cops are on their way. I have to go. I don't have time to take the body. SECOND CALL OK. So, it's over. Verner, you make me a better man. First you help me improve my business, and now my staff, which I should obviously have paid more attention to. Don't look at me like that. I'm not the one who choked her. You may not have blood on your hands, but you made the call. Ah. -Malory? -I'm almost done. DECRYPTION IN PROGRESS Got it. Totem received a text 50 minutes ago that read: "Take care of the package." He called the same number twice on the night of the murder, at 11:37 and 11:39 p.m. And Totem called... And the winner is... Not going to pick up? You think you're so far above it all that you've trapped yourself. You really are an idiot. It's 4:04 p.m., Mr. Favan. You are under arrest for witness tampering, forced prostitution, and accessory to murder. Mr. Bizien, you are also under arrest for witness tampering and the murder of Julie Casteran. What are you doing? Leave it. You can do it tomorrow. No, tomorrow I have to reorganize everything. -You made such a mess of it. -I'm sorry. You can't fire me. You know I don't have a pension. You're going to get trampled. Who said that? -You're mocking me. -No, not at all. Liar. Hey... to Julie. -No, thanks. -Just for a toast. -Just for a toast. -To Julie! To Julie! To Julie. WHERE ARE YOU? WE'RE GOING FOR DINNER. IT'S IMPOLITE TO DISAPPEAR LIKE THAT. I NEVER LIKED YOU! No, I don't want to. But it's not cold. Put your jacket on. It's cold. Hurry up! Otherwise, you won't get any four-cheese. -There'll be more. -No! I want to bring your drawings. I want to look at them. If you have two four-cheeses, you have one eight-cheese. -Mom's project won. -Oh, that's great. -Ah, hello. -Hello. We're going to get pizza to celebrate. She's opening a pediatric clinic. Stop! It hasn't been built yet. -Are you going down? -Yeah, sort of. Sort of... It's either up or down. Call it! Oh, it's here. -Ah, there we go. -Go ahead. Go ahead. -Still deciding? -I'm coming down. Ah. -Congratulations. -Thank you. I'm happy. I can breathe. I'll have work for a few months. Do you want to come? We're celebrating. No, you don't have to. I'd love to have you, but... There... Actually... I wasn't waiting for the elevator. -Oh sorry! -No, no! I would like that. I'd like that.
