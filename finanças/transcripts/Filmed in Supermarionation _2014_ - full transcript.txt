You have reached the home of International Rescue. I'm afraid that our staff are out of the office at the moment. For all your rescuing needs, please contact Spectrum and ask for Colonel White. Goodbye. Cor, who'd have thought it? Ah, there you are, Parker. Begging your pardon, milady. - If I had known-- - No need to apologise, Parker. After all, why should I be the only one to enjoy this little summer getaway? Such a refreshing change of pace from the norm. Don't you agree? Oh, yes, milady. What's this you're reading, Parker? You looked quite engrossed. Well, milady, have you ever wondered how you came to be? Why am I here? What is the meaning of life, et cetera? Why, Parker, having an existential crisis? You could say that, milady. This here book purports to explain everything. Why, how fascinating. Please do go on. Apparently, it all began over 50 years ago. Master Spy, what are you doing here? I have come to finish our discussion about Supercar. - Okay, Venus? - Okay, Steve. Right, let's go. Stingray Two to report to control tower immediately. Okay, Captain Scarlet, it's either gonna be you or me. There are 600 people up there with about 40 minutes to live. Now you can't help them but I believe we can. Parker, we are off on a mission here. What sort of business will it be this time? Show business, Parker. Thunderbirds are go! We had no idea in those days that the sets, the models, the puppets would obviously linger in people's memories for so many years and become such iconic figures. A company had been called in to demolish everything within the studios, and we had guys with sledgehammers just coming in and smashing them up and putting them into skips. And we had to stand there and watch this happening. The fact that everything we'd been doing for the past so many years was being destroyed in front of their eyes. It certainly brought tears to my eyes. Have you heard of a twizzle toy? You haven't? Well, that's because there's only one of them. But perhaps we better begin at the best place for stories. At the beginning. I saw this ad and it was the holiday time and I needed some money. So when I saw that, I thought, "Ah, you know, I'd be interested in that." They didn't give too much information. Well, Pentagon Films was formed purely to make commercials or documentaries or whatever we could get 'cause there wasn't a lot of work around at that stage. And it was at the very beginning of commercial television and a lot of people were jumping in to make television series. There was five people involved. Gerry Anderson, myself, Red Furderer, Douglas Dobbs and a chap called Smith-Morris. They were questioning me as if I was getting this top job. And I thought, "Little do you know, I'm never gonna come back." And so off I went and I said, "Oh, my God, I got out of that." And two days later, I got a phone call, urgent phone call, and they said, "Oh, please, when can you start?" "Because we're in a lot of trouble, we've got something coming." Whereas before they were saying, "Oh, we'll let you know." And, so that's how it all started. Hello, children, it's me, little Noddy, and I've got something for you. One day, a guy called Peter Hayes came in with a Noddy puppet. One on this cup. There. One on this pencil box. And that's how we did our first little bit of puppet film. A 30-second commercial for Kellogg's Ricicles. Yes, I fixed that wobbly wheel and now I'm giving it a nice new coat of paint. Can I bang something please? Hoppity lets me bang things with his hammer sometimes. I'm good at that. We hadn't got any idea of making puppets or shooting puppets. It wasn't in our, you know, it wasn't in our ambition at all. Along came a lady called Roberta Leigh. She was a writer and wanted to make films. And under her arm, she had 52 15-minute scripts. And she said, "Would you like to shoot this series?" And we said, "Yes!" And then she said, "Yes, they're children shows and they've got to be made using puppets." At which point, I nearly vomited on the floor. I say, what a funny-looking toy you are. I've never seen anything like you before. What are you? I'm Twizzle and I do. Oh, what do you do? I twizzle. Twizzle was this little character that could stretch to any height. Boo! And his legs and arms would get bigger. I contacted a puppeteer and she came along with this paper mache puppet, very rough face, eyes were painted on, mouth was painted on, didn't open, and had thick carpet thread to control the puppets. And she said, "Okay, well, here's what you do." "You get a sheet of hardboard, I stand behind it, and on that hardboard, you paint a little scene like a garden say, and I lean over the top, and I perform with the puppet and you film it." Well, of course, I mean, I couldn't see how we could make a television series like that. When we got the job from Roberta Leigh, because we were the cheapest, uh, we then thought, "Well, okay, this is very simplistic stuff to do." But as we're doing it, we might just as well make it as well as we could. I saw myself, that I was gonna be something like a Steven Spielberg of that time and here I was, being asked to make puppet films. But we needed the money, so we took it on. My, what charmingly humble beginnings. Correct, milady. Mr Anderson and Mr Provis decided to go it alone and set up a new company. A.P. Films. And embarked on their puppet adventures. Yes, milady. But you know, their humble beginnings began in rather stately surroundings. So we're here at Islet Park. A beautiful country house in Maidenhead. And this is the place where it all began. So how does it feel for you guys to be back here? - Weird. - Very strange. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yes, it's quite spooky, really. Um... It's-It's changed very slightly, hasn't it? - The, em, you know all the-- - The grounds. - The grounds have changed. - The grounds. When we were here before were-were overgrown and run-very run down and there were none of the houses that you see behind here. It was just all part of the grounds of the house. How long has it been since you were last here? - For me, it's about 55 years, but you-- - 1958. In '57 I came here on Twizzle. I came up with the idea of putting the puppeteers overheard, so we built a Dexion bridge and the puppeteer stood on the Dexion bridge and the puppet was down below which meant there was nothing behind the puppet and so we could use cut-outs of hills and that sort of thing. And that was the first step, uh, you know, that we took towards making, in my opinion, the puppet film respectable. This lovely ballroom was transformed into a chaos of lamps and cables and trying not to scratch the floor too much. The schedule was to shoot one episode per day. We worked all the hours that God made. I mean, we had a wonderful unit and we used to shoot until twelve o'clock at night and start early the next morning. The first floor was offices and cutting room. Yes, offices and cutting room. And the top floor was where I lived. Yeah, we all had rooms. Yeah, yeah. When we were working late, local crew went home and others slept at the studio and it was all very cosy. Sometimes more cosy than I think it should've been. It was a fantastic way to go to work was two flights of stairs and you were on, picking up a cup of coffee as you went past the kitchen and you were on set. And I was usually late. - Right, shall we move on? - Yep. Let's go and have a look round the other side, okay? Roberta Leigh asked us to make another series that she had created. This time, it was Torchy the Battery Boy. Torchy, Torchy the Battery Boy I'm a walking talking toy Press my switch See my bulb start to beam It's the most Magic light you have seen One of the things about Torchy was we did our first special effect shot. Goodbye, Mr Bumbledrop. Goodbye, Torchy. And they explained to me I had two wires. Uh, "On action, Gerry, touch the two wires, the sparklers will all ignite and overhead, the special effects guy will be able to pull it up on a pulley." I touched the two wires, nothing happened. Cut, turnover. Touched the two wires, nothing happened. And I was getting very, very worried because it was a major shot for us. And this time, I stuck the two wires straight into the mains. There was an enormous flash, so bright that I couldn't see for the moment, but all the sparklers ignited, there was lots of smoke and they pulled it up out of shot and we actually made our first special effect shot. Bit amateurish, but we finally got it. - Cutting-edge stuff. - With sparklers, yes. Cutting-edge stuff, yes. It made the Bond movies look like rubbish. But if that sparkler aspect was the sort of starting point... Yes. ...there must've been, something was driving you all on to improve the technical side. It was being paid which was the main incentive... ...and surviving, basically. The puppets were hard work, you know, and-and I think as a director, trying to tell the story with the limitations of what the puppets could do, you know, they couldn't walk about very easily. They couldn't go through doorways, all the usual things. And therefore, editing was this business of cutting away to this and cutting away to that to avoid the bits that didn't work. And I think the special effects came as a great filler. You know, when in doubt, blow something up. Were you a close-knit crew? - Was there a real... - Oh, yeah. - ...sort of family feel? - Yes, yes. Very, very close, it was very... I remember Christmas once when we were right up to the last minute. - Yeah. - And I think we... They cooked a turkey in a film can, in a 3000-foot-film can in the oven and anybody who wasn't working on set used to go and baste it. Torchy is looking for a needle and cotton to sew up my biggle-boggle. Kenneth Connor had a very dirty mind. His big chance came when I played Flopsy the Rag Doll because her stuffing kept falling out and then she wanted to have the stuffing put back again. I do hope Pilliwig can find something soft and woolly to stuff inside me. I tried to make them into family shows, and so we had scenes or lines of dialogue which were a little risqué at that time. I've a wonderful idea. I'll make a toy boy. But it would go straight over the kiddies' heads. The children were playing and shrieking in the garden. All except one little girl who was on her own. She was always stamping her feet and telling everyone what to do so the children called her Bossy Boots. Roberta Leigh was a very rich lady and very difficult to get on with. She wanted her own way in every single thing. She was not, not totally sympathetic sort of lady. And Gerry found out that she was getting a lot more money than she kitted us, 'cause she came along with another proposition and Gerry disliked her so much, he didn't want to do it. We had made not a lot of money but enough to make a pilot film. They wanted to start making the pilot of Four Feather Falls immediately, almost immediately, they finished, um, Torchy. So I was taken on to make the puppets, like the bodies of the puppets. But I had to be kept undercover, so I was in the greenhouse down there and they-they used to say. "Roberta's coming, quick!" And they used to-used to, hide me. Welcome to Four Feather Falls, the friendly western town that's full of fun and excitement. Strewth, I've come over all colour blind. Where are we, Parker? It says 'ere that this is Four Feather Falls. You see, it wasn't always sci-fi, milady. Barry Grey, the composer, had this idea for a cowboy series. In those days, uh, when you go to the movies, you see a puppet, we see a Western, not a puppet Western. Ooh, going mad here now. Four Feather Falls. A western with a difference. Here's the sheriff, Tex Tucker. Howdy, folks. I'd like you to meet my horse Rocky here. Awfully pleased to meet you. He's a thoroughbred, you see. - And my other pal Dusty. - Hiya, folks! Yes, they can talk. Thanks to these magic feathers. We hired a number of stars of that time. The dog and the horse were played by Kenneth Connor. When we were doing Four Feather Falls, I suggested we used a singer called Michael Holliday who sounded exactly like Bing Crosby. Four Feather Falls I said Four Feather Falls The only place on Earth to be 'Cause Four Feather Falls Yes Four Feather Falls Means heaven on the range to me I said it'd be wonderful if he could sing a song for us and we eventually got him and I think it cost us five grand in those days. I thought he had a wonderful voice. Four Feather Falls Four Feather Falls Means heaven on the range to me Heaven on the range to me The sheriff's voice was played by, wait for it, folks, Nicholas Parsons. I told you to get out of town. And that's just what you're gonna do. My hat! Gerry had already cast you, but wanted to know what voices for you to put to the characters he wanted you to play. And he said, "There's the old woman," "Now, Denise, what kind of voice would you try there?" You tried different voices. He said, "Oh, I like that one." But he said, "The trouble is it really needs somebody to read the part of Tex Tucker the sheriff." "Nicholas," he said, "Would you mind doing that?" I'd already plugged you actually, go on. I told him you'd be wonderful. But anyway, go on. And you did do it. White man good. Save Makooya. I love Makooya. Give reward. I want no reward, Chief. All I'd like is a drink of water and something to eat. And I remember his words at the end. And this is absolutely factual. He said, "Well, we found some excellent voices that Denise is gonna supply for the other characters, but I think we've also found our Tex Tucker." There was a scene in the main street of the town at night and it was meant to be everybody in the town was in the saloon. On the windows, which were tracing paper, over on these windows, they wanted silhouettes of lots of things going on. Bob Bell was a great character and Bob and I were both given the job of lying on the floor behind the set with cardboard cut-outs of cowboys with big hats and holding them there, jiggling them about. And we were saying they had to wait while they were lighting, ready, we're gonna do a take, right. "Okay, jiggle." And we were jiggling away, the two of us side by side. "Cut, cut, cut, that's it, thank you." "We're going again, just wait." And there'd be a lot of mumbling, we couldn't hear the other side, and then Bob turned to me and he said, "Do you realise there are men out now in the North Sea trawling for fish, battling with the elements, and what are we doing?" "We've got two cardboard cowboys and we're jiggling them about." He said, "Do you consider that a job worth doing?" And then we had the giggles and the next thing you know somebody was screaming, "We're running!" "Action!" "What? Oh, oh." But you find pretty girls In crimson laces Happy hearts and friendly faces Way back in my hometown Well there's a little old street Where neighbours get together Yes they do And if you ever get there You'll never see a frown Give me the wooden shacks And open spaces Happy hearts and friendly faces Way back in my hometown♪ Way back in my Hometown Far be it for me to interrupt, Parker, but what is Supermarionation? I was just getting to that, milady. Problem is, it's all a bit, uh, technical, so I've had to call in a favour. Hello there, folks, and welcome to "Brains Explains." I'm Brains and I am going to, uh, uh, explain. In this instalment, I'd like to talk to you about Supermarionation. A term coined by producer Gerry Anderson that was intended to describe the unique form of puppetry employed by the team at A.P. Films. You were making the sort of change from paper mache puppets through to carved wood and onwards and I always felt from Dad that he was terribly embarrassed at the fact he was working with puppets. I don't know if you guys felt the same. But Supermarionation, being super marionette animation, that contraction that he came up with, was I think part of the plan to drive things forward and improve things. What then is the make up of a Supermarionation puppet? At its core, this comes down to two unique features. A glass fibre head and the ability to speak. Tell me about the process of actually improving the technology and the process behind making these puppets. Well, it really started with Four Feather Falls when, um, the lip sync was done electronically instead of, uh... by hand. My horse. You've made him talk. But he's got the darnedest English accent. Naturally, old boy. The difficulty was that the mouth was operated by strings to start with and the sync was very inconsistent. You're treading on my toes. Ouch! Ooh, do be careful. I'm sorry, but I can't help it. We'd started off a bit late and ended up on time and the editors had an awful job to fit the dialogue later to the actual mouth movements. In order to achieve convincing lip sync, pre-recorded dialogue was played back on a tape in the studio. The sound waves on the tape were converted into electrical impulses which were then fed via a wire up to the puppeteer bridge and then down into the puppet's head. Oh. It's enough to make you lose your dinner. The result? Perfect lip sync. Uh, uh, uh, in theory. Different actors' voices, different, um, pitches and timbres, whatever they're called, affected them differently. So there were a certain amount of adjustments had to be made and there were two big main controls. One with sensitivity and the other with damping. And by altering these dials, you could alter the way that the mouth on the puppet responded to the dialogue. Uh, and also if there was two puppets speaking to each other in the same, uh, line, the operator had to key across between the others and if the dialogue was close, it was quite an art. When they played the line, maybe, um, "Hello, how are you today?" or something, it would be either his mouth would open. "Hello, how are you today?" and close or else it would go "He-he-hello, how-w-w-w-w are you to-da-da-da-day?" I can't wait to see Atlanta's face. You know, they would lift the back of the head off and tinker around, put it all back, say, "Right, now have a go." And then Gerry would be finally happy and say "That was as good as we'll get it." Usually. You can say that again. In the end, the ballroom was overcrowded. Making another series there was almost impossible. We then actually moved to a small factory on the Slough Trading Estate. - Oh, look at that! - Good God! - Oh, my God! - How amazing! How amazing. - Fantastic. - There's a surprise. When we came here, it was much better than Islet Park 'cause Islet was very cramped, very small and this, suddenly, we had space. - Yeah. - Although it doesn't... It seems quite small to me now. For filming, it was better, but I was sorry to leave Islet Park. - Yes. - Such a nice place. - Happy memories. - Yeah. And this is the actual kind of bridge... It was the kind of bridge-- - ...that we had. - Yes. That was the small bridge wasn't it? - Yes. - I was gonna say it looks small. The big bridge hung from the ceiling and it was quicker, these little stages here that had the sets on were on wheels so you could turn them around to do reverse angles because obviously you couldn't turn the puppet operators around the other way. If you think, Mary, if it goes down, we'll go down together. - Yes. - Right. Supermarionation was originally developed for Four Feather Falls, and A.P. Films hoped to expand upon the technique for their next p-p-production. It had a great deal of charm and it did very well. It got the front cover of the TV Times. Very happy times, very happy atmosphere, but that was due to Gerry and Sylvia as well because they, you know, they created a lovely atmosphere there. Mm, it was like going to a country house. It was always in the country, wasn't it, where we made them. It was A.P. Films, darling, in Slough, which was a-- - Yes, but that was in the country. - No, it's an industrial area. - Oh, well, I would go off-- - It was on an industrial estate. Was it really? - This is your natural romanticism. - It was somewhere in the country. Your natural romanticism, you painted Slough as a beautiful place in the country. Yeah, well, I probably did, yeah. And we really were so thrilled with it and we thought we've really got it here now. So we just waited, as so many people have to do in our business, for the phone to ring. And when it doesn't ring, it's not a very good sign. You know, money was running out now, and finally, we phoned and they said, "Oh, it was lovely, we really enjoyed it, but thank you very much. I don't think we need anymore." Nothing else was on the horizon and slowly, the money ran out and a friend of ours called Frank Greene came in and we told him that we were going bust. He said, "Well, that's ridiculous." He said, "I'm coming in tonight to see you." He said, "I've got a friend called Connery Chappell and he knows Lew Grade." And Gerry went to see Lew Grade and said we want to do this series about a machine called Supercar and Lew Grade said, "Oh, yes, how much will it cost?" I said to him, we've budgeted out and it'll cost 3000 pounds an episode. And he exploded, "3000 pounds an episode! I can't afford to pay you that!" "This is for a kids' series, what are you talking about?" He looked at me and he could see that he'd, you know, shaken me and I was really quite frightened. And so he became very nice and he's Uncle Lew now. "Look, Gerry, if you come and see me tomorrow morning at half past seven and tell me that you've cut the budget in half, I'll give you an immediate contract." Well, Gerry sat down and came up with a figure which was only a third less than he'd offered to Lew Grade. Dawn was breaking and we hadn't cut it in half and I remember saying, "Look, we've allowed for four cups of tea a day for the unit." "What if we reduce that to two?" So he went to see Lew Grade and said to him, "Well, I'm afraid it's not just what you wanted, but that's our figure, and that's our last figure." So Lew Grade sort of got up from his chair and went up to a door and said, "Just a minute", and went through into what Gerry took to be another room and came back a few seconds later and said, "Okay, you got yourself a series." It transpired later that the room that Lew Grade went into was not another office, an accountant's office or something. It was in fact, a cupboard. I turned back and said, uh, "Mr Grade, um, is it possible for you to let me have a letter of intent", and then again, he exploded. He said, "A letter of intent?" "My word is better than any contract or agreement you could ever get drawn up." "Now get out of here and make the series." Supercar Supercar With beauty and grace As swift as can be Watch it flying through the air It travels in space or under the sea And it can journey anywhere Supercar Supercar Supercar Supercar is set in 1960 in the Nevada Desert. With the pilot Mike Mercury, a good, clean, all-American guy. Full throttle vertical. His rather freckled sidekick, a kid called Jimmy. - All set, Jimmy? - Yeah. - Gee, I sure am excited. - Better climb aboard, then. Of course, for merchandising, a woolly animal which was Mitch the Monkey. Mitch! If you consider that there are three characters, Mike Mercury, Jimmy and Mitch, you ain't got a lot of dialogue going between those three. But if you have somebody like Beaker you begin to get some interesting dialogue going because he's a character. Oh, I say. Now who's a fool? We did find it very challenging to write dialogue for him. "Mitch, eek, eek." Or "um, um." Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. I shouldn't go further than that because it may be ethically wrong with the animal kingdom. And they're constantly being tailed by Master Spy who wants to steal their technology. Well, friend Zarin, and what do you think of that? Oh, I liked it, Master Spy, very much. - But I prefer Westerns. - You fool. We seek not to rival the motion picture people but to gain valuable information. Oh. We needed aerial shots, background shots, that we would put Supercar in front of. People looking out of the window of Supercar so we had to have air to ground shots. We had to come up here at White Waltham with a twin-engine plane. We flew over the south of England shooting clouds. We went up to 12,000 feet in this aircraft and at 12,000 feet, you really need, uh, oxygen otherwise, you can get, um, oxygen starvation and start doing silly things like jumping out of the aircraft and believing you can fly, that sort of thing. John Read was very distressed. He was on camera and he was gasping for breath rather like a fish out of water. And I said, "John, what's the trouble?" and he said, "Gerry, I can't breathe, I've only got one lung." Well, I was shattered because I'd known him for a long, long time, but I didn't know this about him. So I rushed to the cockpit and said, "Quick, lose height because my partner has only got one lung and he's suffocating." And the pilot said, "But I've got an engineer here who's got a cold and if I descend, I'm gonna blow his eardrums out." And so we circled for half an hour to come down in order to save John and the engineer. Mike, there's only one chance! Fire the air brakes at zero feet. - It might just save us. - Roger, switching to clear view. Height 5000 feet, descending 12,000 feet per minute. Stand by to fire air brakes. - Hold tight, Mitch! - Fire! Supercar. Quite a departure from the Wild West. Well, you see milady, the 1960s was the era of the space race, which meant that science fiction was en vogue and besides, having the characters sitting in all of these vehicles helped with one other problem. We did get the puppets to do most things that we wanted but the thing we couldn't get them to do was to walk. Working with puppets, of course, is very difficult. Very, very difficult. Very, very frustrating. - Very frustrating. - Very frustrating. Hang on, string's broken. - Her lip's jammed. - His arm's locked again, sorry. One second, standing her up. And, sorry her boobs have turned. Oh, it's enough to make you lose your dinner. Oh, sorry, he's supposed to talk during that. They are the most difficult things to work with and it's more a science than art, the construction of this, so they move well. At the end of six foot strings, you are, to a certain extent, quite sort of remote from it. You can see the length of these strings was a real problem that when I turn this controller here, there's a delay before the head moves. Like that. It takes time. So when you turned the thing, it took a while for the puppet to react. There's a delay and then when it moves it carries on swinging, so you then had to try and correct. I'm way out of practise. With the marionettes, you, uh... You know, they swung about quite a lot. You sort of turn their heads and ooh, ooh. My arm's aching already. The knees used to bend as your arms got tireder and tireder and tireder. They ended up... - Sinking to the floor. - ...sinking to the floor. Woo! You could give the impression where you'd have somebody cross an alleyway but you'd put something in between them and their lower half and so what you saw was - the character from there up. - Waist up. And then you'd shoot the shot and it looked as if they'd actually run somewhere. Of course they hadn't run anywhere, they'd just been dragged across. I know that you were all constantly on the quest to sort of make the puppets more real, so what did you do? I went along and I chose all the men and I put little willies on them. You know... And when the girls got in the morning, oh, there was the most terrible uproar about these, and I said, "Well, you know, you've gotta bring them to life somehow, haven't you?" They sprayed the strings to make sure that you couldn't see them, although you could, of course. Don't say that to my mother, she doesn't like that. Of course they were very specialised, very, very thin wire. All right, you can see them now and again, but on the whole, they were incredibly thin wire. But they were always breaking. The time one spent getting everybody and everything ready for the moment when the camera was gonna be switched on to make a take. You've got to check if this one is right, if the puppeteer, sometimes there would be three or four puppeteers all standing there holding this weight, you know, waiting for the moment when you were going to turn over. There were strings that have to be dusted and got rid of 'cause they would glisten in front of the camera. There might be somebody who's got to do something at a particular moment. And everybody's got to be ready. And so, everybody, after all this time that we'd been waiting, rehearsing, lighting, getting the right lens, doing all these things. Everything's ready and so, you know, you say, "Okay, turnover, action." We had, in fact, been living together for quite some time and now and again she would say, "Well, aren't we gonna get married?" and I would say, "Yes of course, but you know, we can't do it at the moment, we were too busy." Eventually, we found the time and we went up to town, and got married, I was driving back to the studio and it was quite late and on the grass in front of this little studio I saw the round water tank the fire service had filled with water and it had Supercar on a line and somebody was holding their breath, holding it underwater. They would release it and it slid out the water and it wasn't working. So I said to my then-wife, "Sorry, I'll be late." Early on, I think it was... Gerry and Sylvia were still happy together, I can remember them both being very happy and romantic. Gerry, absolute visionary. Sylvia, she was the person everybody went to if there was ever a problem. He was very gentle and he had great imagination and he sort of inspired one. I loved Sylvia from the moment I met her. The truth is, that we worked together so I was able to supply, if you like, the human side and he was able to provide the technical side and work with our technical team. He actually changed the face of, not just children's television, but television. He was a workaholic, Gerry. He'd work day and night, he didn't have any other interest whatsoever. He was driven, a driven man, without question. He would sometimes get very offended if somebody was seen to be defecting to another side. He fell out with a few people along the way because they would go and work for another studio or might suggest something contrary to what he was thinking about. Whether that be something creative or a design or a story or anything like that. So sometimes, he would fall out with people unnecessarily and burn bridges, which was a shame because that never really helps but, I think, he was a product of his upbringing and had some really tough times. And those things not only caused these, uh... these, uh, I dunno, ructions I guess, with other people later in life but those are also the things that made him so successful. Gerry was a terrific editor, and he was in the air force as well, and I think he was a control tower man, so he had a great sense of drama. You know, I can imagine Gerry sitting there hoping something would go wrong so that we could, so he could have a drama on his hands. So he could then relay to a bigger drama. She was like a social worker or an agony aunt. Never in a flurry, never lost her temper. Uh, wonderful. You do find, when you've got a group of people, there are problems, there are going to be. People would come in and go, "Oh, it's Sylvia", because it was like a big family, you know. I was going out with so and so and he's just broken up with me, what do I do. My mother will go-- "Look, don't worry about it, you take a week off and then you, you know, I know you must be very upset." "Don't worry and I'll see you next week and we'll talk about it when you come back." You know, it was all that sort of thing. I was naturally interested in their problems. You know, they're having problems at home or their financial things, whatever it was, they came into my office and we talked about it. Sylvia was, without doubt, the most important part of A.P. Films, I think. I mean, Sylvia was not only, did the voice of Lady Penelope but she was part of the creative team. And was no fool when it came to actually deciding what could and couldn't be done with the shots. As our series is based on the 21st century and is futuristic, we try to, at the least, make the costumes contemporary, and at the best, futuristic. Are you trying to somewhat lead fashion by the costumes of Lady Penelope? Well, we are really, yes, and there will be Lady Penelope dolls and fashions and I hope this will perpetuate the image that we create on screen. Gerry was much more creative in different directions so he would be very good with ideas, with all the adventures, all the hardware, everything. From the point of view of creating fantasy, it is important to, uh, make fantasy as believable as possible, so that it is acceptable. This is what we try to do. No one person can put together a sort of series that we had. And I think at that time, that was the secret of our success. Not one or the other, but both. Supercar, Supercar With beauty and grace As swift as can be Well, Parker, what happened next? Oh. Uh... Sorry, milady. Supercar was an amazing success all around the world and A.P. Films was well and truly saved from bankruptcy. And so the series ran and ran. Uh. Not quite, milady. Old Lew Grade was always looking to the future. He wanted something bigger and better. - Okay, Venus. - Okay, Steve. Right, let's go. I had heard that the Russians were experimenting with launching their rockets, instead of vertically and rising vertically, that they would go along, gain speed along a railway track and then, rather like an aircraft, lift its nose and fly. The opening sequence for Fireball XL5, where it gets fired up a ramp with all these rockets, was a nightmare because Fireball had to be held on wires and there I was, hanging over the top of the set trying to match the speed of the vehicle being pulled up the thing and if you look at it, it's terribly bumpy. Fireball XL5 came out at a time when the space race was hotting up and of course, it was the time of the Cold War between the West and the Soviet East so there was a lot of paranoia in the air. As I feared, Lieutenant 90. A missile. And according to the computer, it's carrying a planatomic bomb. Steve Zodiac and Venus work for the World Space Patrol and they basically fly around a certain sector of space exploring it and defending it from any alien attackers or odd occurrences. Say, Venus, how's our beautiful doctor of space medicine? I gather by the compliment, Steve, you want something to eat. There was slight comic relief from Professor Matic. Matthew is a crazy inventor basically, I suppose. A kind of mad professor type. We're on our way home at last. On our way home. There was Robert the Robot, who was quite-rather quite engaging. He took to the camera very well and was very amusing when he used to shoot his top. Yeah, now, now, Robert, it's no need to get all steamed up. It had a lot of, uh, curious creatures. This was the head of a fish creature. His teeth were made out of plastic toothpicks. This, uh, plant man was for another one of the Fireball programmes and, um, again, this is a carved figure. His eye was just one single light-bulb in this flute. The Earthmen. Steve Zodiac. All of them powerless. It is poisonous, Professor. Get the gas masks, Steve. Gee, that's better, I can breathe again. Yeah. Me, too. Guess we better re-join Fireball and repair the damage. I'll radio Venus that we're on our way back. In America, it was part of television history. At the time, America wouldn't touch British product but in fact, NBC took it for distribution in the States and it was a huge, huge, huge success. There was certainly amazing pioneering work done here although it all seemed very Mickey Mouse at the time. Welcome home. Full power. Welcome home. I'm so pleased to be back. Stingray has just passed the island heading in the direction of explosion zone. Oh, mighty Titan, Stingray is doomed. The atmosphere during recordings was very relaxed, always. - Um... weren't they? Too relaxed sometimes. We would do three episodes at a time. Sylvia would designate who would do the other voices. And I would say, "Have you got any comments?" Which of course, I shouldn't have said because everyone's got a comment. - Everybody gathered around... - That's true. ...this one microphone, central microphone and you know, sometimes, there were eight, nine, ten people there. It was like a scrum. What I particularly enjoyed about the way that they worked was very much like radio. We thought it would come as a prepared package in many ways and that the film of the puppets would be made and we'd be dubbing to their little mouths moving away like that. We didn't have to worry about matching anything. Sometimes, when you do animation work, the animation is done and then you have to lip sync it after. But what joy! We could do it while, which is much, much easier and, and um, better. So we could do very natural line readings. We could interrupt ourselves, we could stutter and stammer and kerfuffle around and keep the readings very spontaneous. Well, milady, have you ever wondered how you came to be? Why am I here? What is the meaning of life, et cetera? Why, Parker? Having an existential crisis? Yes, milady. Quite, milady. Yes, milady. Yes, milady. I received a call at the studio from Lew and he said, "Gerry, can you come up and see me?" And I said "Yes, sure, tomorrow morning." And he said, "Well, can you come up now?" So I drove up to ATV House and he looked me straight in the eye and he said, "Gerry, I've decided to buy your company." And I thought to myself, "What a bloody cheek this bloke's got." I mean, he didn't say, "I'd like to buy your company." No, "I'm going to buy your company." Not, "Would you like to sell your company?" No, "I've decided to buy your company." And I sat there thinking, "What a damn cheek he's got." And then he told me how much he was prepared to pay and I remember thinking what a good idea that he should buy my company. Stand by for action! We are about to launch Stingray! Why, it's in colour. Yes, milady. Something facilitated by Mr Grade's dough. You mean Lord Grade of Elstree, Parker. Quite, milady. Incidentally, old Lew's cash changed everything for A.P. Films. We moved from Ipswich Road to Stirling Road on the Slough Trading Estate in 1963. That's where it all really took off. Marineville, I am calling battle stations. Anything can happen in the next half hour. We had more money, we had more time. The sheer luxury of a large building. We had everything that we ever dreamed of. I thought that was the beginning of something special. Stingray Stingray Stingray Stingray Stingray Stingray was a submarine which could go to great depths. This is how they discovered a race of beings that were living underwater. Because we'd been everywhere, if you think about it, so we thought it's time we went with our characters underwater. They were based at Marineville where we had Commander Shore in charge. And they are essentially defending the planet from Titan who is an evil undersea overlord or underlord I guess you'd say. The main craft though is Stingray, which is piloted by Troy Tempest and Phones and they are ably assisted by the dumb but beautiful Aqua Marina. It became a jokey thing in the end, of course, with a woman that doesn't speak. One of the girls in the control room was called Atlanta. Those two were both in love with Troy Tempest. Lucky old Troy Tempest. Commander Shore. Lieutenant. Atlanta. Meet Marina, the latest recruit to the World Aquanaut Security Patrol. Marina. Well, what do you know? Yeah, well, eh, as I was saying. At least we know what we're up against. Well, I certainly know what I'm up against. I was very pleased to be part of the Stingray process because I understand that it was the first series to be done in England that was done entirely in colour. While we were in America, we saw colour for the first time and it just knocked us out and we said, "We've got to do our next series in colour." It had no shelf life. If you made it in black and white, the whole world was gonna turn to colour. Kodak managed to produce a single strip of film uh, which could be exposed like any other film and when it was developed and printed, it came out in colour. And that meant suddenly, that it was possible for us, who were making television pictures, to make them in colour. But of course, we had to talk to Lew Grade again. So we came back home, saw Lew Grade and said, "Lew, you've got to do our next series in colour." Being cautious, as I've always been, I sent Reg Hill to the American networks where they had been shooting colour. Phones, watch what you're doing with that paint. Sorry, Troy. And, uh, when he come back, right, we'll have a little chat on stage and we'll go, "Right, mate." "Um, got to be flat, everything's gotta be lit flat. Flat, flat, flat. No shadows, flat." Can't use that colour. Right, repaint it. Can't use deep greens like that. Reds are out, it bleeds you know. And so we had to tear all the sets apart and rebuild them. That colour looks great, Atlanta. And everything had to be put back, oh, a month I think, because everything had to be painted and colours had to be changed 'cause the spectrum for black and white television was different. So as a result, you got everybody coming along and saying, "Well, what do you do about colour? I mean, what about the background? What about the blue? Can you use white, can you use black?" If you look at the first films we made in colour, they all have one thing in common. When you looked at the screen, it said, "They are shooting in colour." It was really quite a revolution, but it was nice to know that we started it in a way. Right, stand by to repel attack. Shots involving water were a staple of the effects unit. For surface shots, a special tank with an infinite horizon was constructed. However, filming underwater required a little more ingenuity. So as you can see, the illusion of being underwater is done by holding the model on wires with a set built behind it, a fish-tank in front and little fish swimming around in the tank and reflections in the water which added to the realism. That's how we used to do it with a high-speed camera. We were sitting in the boardroom one evening wondering how to shoot underwater stuff and Reg Hill said, "I've got a brilliant idea. Look at that calendar, and there's an aquarium on it. That's what we'll do, we'll shoot through an aquarium." They shoot through the glass. And this tank was manufactured on Slough Trading Estate and it had really quite thick glass in it and we started shooting on it and when you put water in the tank you could see the putty bulging out on the edges of the tank as the pressure of the water pushed the glass further towards the metalwork. Unbeknown to anybody, there was a welding spot of metal proud, and the glass, over a period of about three days, got closer and closer to this point. The whole thing shattered. It's a perfect example of what I was saying earlier about learning tricks here in the small time and then using them again, 'cause at a big film studio, I did a whole underwater sequence and we shot through a tank and it looked so convincing it was unbelievable and I kept thinking it was trying those ideas with Gerry - all those years ago. - Sure. And here I was on E Stage at Shepperton doing the same thing. And so, Your Majesty, with my great cunning, using all the experience I have gained working as a surface agent, I have discovered that Duke Dexter is coming to Marineville. Excellent! Excellent! How did you find out? Well, I read it in the newspaper. Brilliant! So Duke Dexter is coming to Marineville. Who is Duke Dexter? One day, there was a gentleman standing by my bench and he was standing there in his suit and he stood there for quite a long time and I thought, well, obviously, he's part of a visiting team and he just suddenly said, "That's amazing, what you're doing. The talent you've got", he said. "How do you learn to do that?" So to make conversation, I said politely, "Are you visiting the studios?" He said, "Oh, no, no, I work here." And I thought, "Work here? I've been here years and I've never seen this guy." And he said, "Well, I don't actually work in the studios, I just write the music." Supercar Supercar With beauty and grace Fast as can be Watch it flying through the air Captain Scarlet He's the one who knows The Mysterons game And things they plan You're magic to me A beautiful mystery I'm certain to fall I know Because you enthral me so - Oh, the music was fantastic. - Yeah, Barry Grey. Ah, yes. I mean, Barry Gray's music was the most identifiable constant through all the Supermarionation shows I guess. My God. The way his tunes were played all around the world. Music was to me, one of the crowning glories of every programme that was produced by Century 21. You couldn't possibly say that they were all variations on the same kind of music. I mean, Barry was a musical genius. It had a personality, his music. It was always a few notes that were totally memorable. I don't think you'll find many other shows whose theme tunes have become so entwined culturally like the "Thunderbirds March." Thunderbirds are go! I got the Thunderbirds theme when I was lying awake in bed about seven o'clock one morning. I've always got music running through my mind. Whatever I'm doing, it seems to be a subconscious thing. If I need a theme or something, I call upon it and there it appears. I composed the Fireball theme in my mind when I was driving back from the film company home one evening and this is how it goes. Music was his absolute world. My heart would be a fireball A fireball 'Cause you would be My Venus of the stars So tell me, Parker, when do we enter the story? Well, it's funny you should mention that, milady. We're about to come on the scene as it were. You see, it all began with a mine disaster. Eight days and nights had passed since Lengede mine flooded. For the three men trapped below, the critical moments were drawing very near. This was the testing time for perhaps the most intricate rescue operation in mining history. The story was on every news bulletin for about three weeks. The plan was to bring the men up one at a time, so maintaining the high air pressure which held back the water. All went well. Into the decompression chamber, the miners were transferred without mishap. For three hours, they were slowly adjusted to atmospheric pressure. Then at last, they came out. And of course, it was a very moving story. Many of the men died. The thing that did it for me was they've located the miners, they're trapped under there and the only way we can get them out is to drill a big bore hole. But the only machine capable of it is eight hours away. I was at my parents' home and they came in from the garden and were very excited and said, "We've got this amazing, amazing idea and it's gonna be a big hit." And so we embarked on the most difficult and most costly series I've ever made. Jeff Tracy is an ex-astronaut and entrepreneur who's a multi, multi millionaire. Thunderbirds are go! And together with his five sons, sets up a rescue organisation using craft developed by Brains, their chief scientist. I decided that it made sense that the whole thing would be cloaked in secrecy. Hence, the base was set on an island in the Pacific. And they basically go all over the world rescuing people in distress. These are scenarios that normal emergency services and rescue teams couldn't deal with. Of course, the launching of the various machines. The pool that slid back. The palm trees which swung out to allow Thunderbird 2 which came out from a hangar inside a rock. Thunderbird 3 came up and went through a circular house. All of that added interest. Five seconds! Throw down your gun or the professor will be pushed in front of the express. Four! Three! Two! Here she comes! But the most outstanding commercial success of all in television puppetry has been scored by Sylvia Anderson and her husband Gerry, creators of the many science fiction series first shown by ATV and now known throughout the world. The Andersons were in the big time on an international scale and it was no accident that many of their characters spoke with American accents. There were two reasons. The first one is financial. Uh, it's because our programmes sold to America and went on the American networks and this is quite unique at this time. If you put all the sales together and added up the figure, America would pay a much larger figure than the whole world put together. We needed the American sale in order to make the sophisticated programmes in the puppetry world that I believe we made, particularly in science fiction. So when Supercar happened, uh, it was science fiction and, um, that was associated with America at that time. This American woman would not have it. "Why aren't these puppets in America?" And they were saying, "Well, they're not American." "They're English", and they said, "This is a puppeteer, one of the puppeteers." They're American, yes. She would not believe we made it in England. "No, no, it's American." In the early '60s, the British boffin was not a terribly glamorous character. Not the way he is today. You have the British lawyer, the British doctor, rather stuffy. I don't really think the stuff that TV puppet heroes are made of. - You called, milady? - Yes, Parker. Get the Rolls Royce. We are going for a little drive. Having had a whole bunch of American characters, I thought we ought to have at least two English characters. And then I thought the two things that the Americans would understand would be a cockney character or the posh lady with the twinset and pearls. Well, why not put them both together? We're closing in on him, milady. Good, Parker. Wait till we get to a clear stretch of road. We don't want to create a scene. Go ahead, Parker. Yes, milady. Parker was born in a pub restaurant in Cookham. They had a nice English little restaurant there and they had a wine waiter. This head waiter was obviously retired but he'd formally worked in the royal household. And he'd stop at the table and he said to me "Things I could tell you about the old Prince of Wales." And then he'd go off. He was a snob who dropped his H's and then put them back in the wrong place. He came over and he said, "Would you like to see the wine list, sir?" And I looked at Gerry and Gerry looked at me. Parker was a smash hit overnight, and then, of course, we said, "Now what are we gonna do about Arthur? Are we gonna tell him?" It was obviously, he was a man who was a cockney but had pulled himself up by his shoelaces. Would he be proud or would he be offended? We decided he would be offended, we didn't tell him and he went to his grave never knowing. Sylvia, the real-life Lady Penelope is directly responsible for the characterisation and costumes. How do you decide on the characteristics of your cast? Well this starts, initially, in the script stage. My husband Gerry and myself write the original script so that when we actually put pen to paper we have a mental image of the character as it should be. And, uh, I think we develop it from there. Do you sort of see characteristics in people you know, magazines and this sort of thing? Yes, all the time, all the time. I think, in actual fact, what we do is we take, um, a composite face. In other words, we take the eyes of someone, nose from someone else and so on so we can then produce the perfect face. We got Parker, all right, because Parker was caricature. But with Penelope, it was more like a real person. I modelled what I thought Lady Penelope would look like from what I had in the script and Sylvia was very interested in that character. We couldn't get it right. I looked at her, I don't know. It's just not working. So she said, "Look, shall I take it home for the weekend?" You get to a point where you don't know where you're going with it. So she took it home at the weekend and came back on Monday and she brought it in to me, this is in plasticine. She painted it and as she walked in I said, "Yeah, that's it." They've got it, absolutely right. It seemed to somehow get more and more like Sylvia herself. - Down to the blonde wig. - Yes. We had a team of writers by then but they didn't understand how to write for someone like Lady Penelope. So I had a really hard job and it made me realise, for the first time, that there was gonna be quite a task to get her into the mix of what we already had. It was unusual in that particular type of action show for a lady like that to take a leading role, but she caught on. She was the Emma Peel of Thunderbirds. Yeah. They leave me no choice. We're up against men who will stop at nothing. She was the star of the show, really. I could write the characters, the women characters, but keep them up to date. And I think I managed to reflect really, what was happening at that time. Lady Penelope, I've, uh, seen some of your exploits in Thunderbirds and I must say, you play it very cool. And what a fabulous wardrobe. Just everybody's talking about it. Really? Do go on. I've heard that you have a different outfit for every occasion. What utter nonsense. Quite untrue. Oh, but Lady Penelope, I mean, I-I thought you were wearing a-- Are you still on about clothes? Really. As a secret agent, I've got far more important things to think about. Well, I think this is where I make a quiet exit and leave Lady Penelope to another exciting episode of Thunderbirds. Fireflash from Thunderbird 2. Cut engines. So let's have a look at some of the techniques employed to make these impressive craft fly. Derek Meddings and his team experimented with a rolling sky system. This involved a painted loop of canvas wrapped around a pair of rollers. Driven by a motor, the background would revolve, thereby making the model hung in front of it look like it was flying. However, when it came to the first episode of Thunderbirds, Derek had his work cut out for him. With very limited studio space, he had to devise a method that would allow the Fireflash to come down a runway. The answer he devised was ingenious. To enable us to get forced perspective on tracking shots with models and sky and road, we used to use a rolling road running at one speed with the sky moving at a slightly slower speed and models suspended over the top of the road. So cue the road and cue the sky boys. Derek, how do you evolve the futuristic designs of your models? Well, usually I just start doodling on a pad and, uh, whatever happens, that's usually what we get in the time. Sometimes we have to dress them up a bit. What limits do you put on probability? Well, there aren't any limits as far as we're concerned. We'd try anything. If you asked me would I name one person that was a genius, in the true sense, it was Derek Meddings. Pretty handy with his fireworks, wasn't he? We were never short of fireworks - on fireworks night. - Loved petrol jelly. Without his effects, I don't think the programmes that were made would have been half as popular as they were. Anything you put in front of Derek, he could do. Or he'd get round it, or he'd find somebody who did know how to get round it. As much as we could, we were bringing big film techniques to the little screen. The kind of special effects that he was doing weren't being done on a television scale. You know, what did you have, you had Dr Who but they were like held together with string. Any special effects they did, they weren't clever and they weren't classy. Backstage, there's a vast empire of scenic design and model-making. Everything is custom designed and built to scale. Houses, spaceports, Thunderbird craft, vehicles, down to guns and watches. After use, they're either stored for the future or scavenged for new creations. All the models are identically reproduced in various scales to suit the scene and a perfect continuity must be maintained. It's a model-maker's paradise, spoiled only by the dirtying down process needed to give realism. The secret of all our models was they were dirtied down like aeroplanes are, with streaks of grease and exhaust burns and cracked glasses on spotlights and so on. I think if you look at some of the opening shots of Thunderbirds where we zoom back from five, four, three, two, one, the numbers are only about two or three centimetres high on those models and yet the panelling work around those numbers has to show as realistic, not just a piece of plastic or wood. And it was all that level of detailing and the lettering. The little "no step" warning signs and things of that nature which did add a sort of whole veneer of complexity and reality to our models which I think was missing from a lot of, at that time, even mainstream film models. I used to go to the toy shops and buy all these plastic kits and they would buy them, not to make up an aeroplane, but to use all the pieces. You could go down to Woolworths and you'd come out with a lot of plastic boxes, beach balls, salt and pepper sets. Anything really, that we thought might be useful. And you would use these as the basis of your model and then you would detail on top of those shapes and try and disguise them so that people didn't sit and look at it and go, "Oh, yes there's a beach ball." It didn't always work, sometimes we got it wrong. There is one thing that haunts me and that's a lemon squeezer which was stuck on the wall at the back of Thunderbird 1's set. In special effects, fire and water are known as two of the most difficult elements to work with as they cannot be scaled down convincingly. However, high-speed photography provided the solution. Conventional film is exposed at a rate of 24 frames per second. By shooting the same action across a higher number of frames and then playing the footage back at the standard 24 frames per second, any motion is slowed down. Flying shots tend to bump. Aircraft, rockets and so on. The higher speed you film it, so you slow down the action so it moves very, very nicely and prettily. Small water ripples became crashing waves. Modest fires became raging infernos and futuristic craft appeared to gain mass and weight which belied their small scale. You can see here this is a shot which uses a combination of plastic kits to look like an oil refinery and we would've buried in amongst all this stuff, little explosive charges and slightly bigger explosive charges and even bigger explosive charges to make the whole refinery blow up which would be done with a series of hits, one after the other. Camera running at high speed. And focus from as close to the camera lens as we could get to the backing to make it all look like reality. So if you're ready, boys, we can blow it up. Action! International Rescue from Thunderbird 1. International Rescue, Lady Penelope speaking. Oh, hi there, Penelope. I'm just radioing in to let you know that I'm heading back in Thunderbird 1. I should be with you in 29 and one quarter minutes. Cor! Anything could happen in the next half hour! It was made at first as a half an hour. I took it to show Lew Grade. End title music, lights came up, and he was silent for a moment. And my heart was thumping 'cause I'd spent a fortune on this thing. Five! And he walked all the way down the theatre to the screen... Four! "Gerry." "This is not a television series." Three! I was absolutely distraught. Two! "Gerry, I'm telling you, this is not a television series." One! He then said, "Gerry, this is a feature film." Thunderbirds are go! Now the thing is, he then said, "You'll have to make them one hours." I said, "But we've shot nine pictures as a half hour." He said, "I don't care, you'll have to make them as one hours." A brand new television series is about to be filmed. The completed puppets, perfect down to the smallest detail, are handed to the expert puppeteers who will bring them to life on the screen. As in any film studio, many different skills are needed. A team of nearly 100 technicians, cameramen and artists are kept busy producing a different 60-minute film every week. And now, all is ready. The director has a final check and the cameras roll. When I first arrived, they were making Thunderbirds and it was bigger and better, more money. Just the whole thing had moved on. So many people were, that worked for us, were new to the film industry. I'd no idea about the concept of actually making a film and how you put it together. But I learned it very quickly. And that was what was so wonderful about working for Gerry and Sylvia at that time, was that it was like going back to school. And the children outside that used to collect outside the doors but any minute it opened, they were, all these faces, all sort of staring to get in and anything that was put outside to cool off would disappear. They'd all take stuff away. Uh, it was just fun, and everybody was friendly... - Yeah. - ...and happy there. It was very, very busy. It was a wonderful, wonderful atmosphere, it really was. In the swinging '60s, anything is possible. It was the beginning of the swinging '60s, and we were total part of it. We were in the hub of it and we were the, we were the stars of the children's programmes. The Beatles were number one in every country in the world. England had just beaten Germany in the World Cup final at Wembley. Anyone who was involved in it was very proud. Certainly us newcomers. It was just fantastic. Humour was the thing that kept us going. When we were dead tired, no money, and everything was going wrong, we started then, we'd either have a party, or we'd just collapse with laughter. They, uh, had one, at least one marvellous party that is memorable, at their home. There was talk of going in swimming and somebody said, "Well, nobody's got any costume." And Des said, I remember him, he stood up, he said, "Well, I've had enough of this". He... He'd shot into the little chalet bungalow they had there by the side of the pool, strides out stark naked and just jumps into the pool. Everybody screamed and laughed and then a little voice, uh, spoke up, a little, uh, lady's voice and she said, "Well, what's all the fuss about? "I didn't think that was very much, did you?" You were trying to cover everything up, weren't you? No, I wasn't! - Oh, weren't you? - I was proud of it! The brakes are applied but the wheels catch fire. They're out of control. Will the plane crash too? We can't tell you, but when Thunderbirds reaches the world's TV screens, just ask any child. Thunderbirds came on and everybody watched Thunderbirds. The success of the series was like a lift-off of one of Gerry's rockets on a ramp and it just went up and up and up and up, culminating in Thunderbirds. At what point did you become aware that you were part of something really, really big? I don't think any of us did because... We just went from one series to another. And it always got better and then when we'd finished, well, we don't want any of those puppets anymore 'cause we've got new puppets coming along so everything got discarded. Yeah. And, nobody realised we were making history. I think I realised they were successful when I saw them on television myself. I actually saw them on television receiving awards. Uh, Mr Reg Hill, Associate Producer, will receive the award for the ITV Children's Programme of the Year, Thunderbirds. They used to come flooding in, the letters. I just really thought all kids were stupid 'cause they wrote to Lady Penelope. And I knew she wasn't real. We had a letter from the National Physics Laboratory. They said Thunderbird 2 is aeronautically impossible. We had that level of correspondence from fans. What is the series that has made such an enormous impact on millions of viewers of all ages? Now go, go, go! Thunderbirds are go! Now on the big screen. In Technicolour. And Techniscope! And Thunderbirds Are Go was... it was probably just an enormous amount more problems. Everything had to be that much better. We were going on the big screen. We're blowing up here. The sets had to be immaculate. The props had to be that little bit better. These are puppets but they're gonna be 30-foot-tall by the time they get into a cinema. Attention to detail quadrupled really. Biggest problem of all was, well, we don't want any strings to be seen. Well, I said but, you know, you're gonna be putting this on a 70-foot sheet, how can we avoid the strings? He said, "Well I don't wanna see any." That's why some of the compositions are a bit tight on the head. Sometimes I feel You are cheating me When you kiss me And my mind is free But then I think I should let you know That I got friends So baby listen to me It was very well-made and I thought it was a great picture and so did everybody else. It was a really exciting time. I mean, you have to remember we'd all come up from Supercar and our own private showing down at Ipswich Road but now, we were at Leicester Square. We'd hit the big time, boys. It was just absolutely magic, really and truly. I was with an executive from the American company that had co-produced it with Lew and he was swirling his Scotch round in a glass and thinking and he said, "You know, Gerry..." "I can't make up my mind whether this is gonna take as much money as Bond or more." It was a glamorous time for such a small company. Why, it was such a glittering affair wasn't it, Parker? I don't remember much about it, milady. If you recall, I was left to serve the drinks. And the film was an amazing success. Wasn't it, Parker? Mind the gap, milady, when you step into the car. Thank you, Parker. We don't want to fall back to Earth, do we? Mind the gap, Alan. Mind the gap, Alan. Mind the gap. When the show was over and we left the theatre, the manager, I said, "Well, goodnight, sleep well." And he said, "You're joking." He said, "I'll be up all night." He said they'll be queuing up five o'clock tomorrow morning to see this. Well, they didn't queue up. In fact, the theatres were empty. I don't think it got a very good reception at all. I think the reviews were... were stilted. They weren't kind. As critics aren't. And obviously, it hurt. And the only thing that we could think was at that time the audience was not used to seeing... a feature film version of a television show. So people would look and see Thunderbirds and they'd say, "Well, we've seen it on television." The following day, Sylvia and I went on tour to promote the film. It was just a terrible time because our marriage was breaking up. I mean, the movies, I don't know I should say but they never worked as well as the... as they did on the small screen. At the time, we thought we were doing a good job and we thought it was great. But I think on reflection, I think it's difficult to move that type of show onto the big screen. When we were recording Thunderbirds Are Go at Denham Studios, news came down that... Thunderbirds, the television show series, was being cancelled. I went to see Lew and I thought he was going to say "Let's go on with Thunderbirds," but he said "I want a new show." I think Lew Grade ran into, uh, a problem with distribution. And I appealed and he said, "Gerry..." "It's easier for me to sell a new show than more Thunderbirds." I mean, it was doing very well, it was running around the world almost. America didn't want it anymore, so therefore, Lew Grade wasn't brave enough, I think, to realise that he could still keep doing it in England and the rest of the world would follow, but he didn't. Yes, we missed an opportunity there. This is the voice of the Mysterons. One of you will be under our control. Parker, what are you doing? Beg pardon, milady, but we've now arrived at the series which followed in our wake. Not so friendly for the little nippers, is it? Captain Scarlet was a much colder... uh, a much darker series. With Captain Scarlet, we were moving away from more of the family thing. Captain Scarlet follows the Spectrum Organisation, led by Colonel White. Unfortunately, at the beginning of the series, they have a mission to Mars where they're met by the Mysterons. The Mysterons look to monitor what's going on. Unfortunately, the visitors take it as a potential attack and they attack first. And this initiates a war between the Mysterons and Earth and it's Spectrum's job to defend it. The main character in that obviously, is Captain Scarlet, who, by a strange twist of fate, is made indestructible when he's first mysteronized by the Mysterons and then somehow, through an accident, regains control of his faculties and helps Spectrum lead the fight against them. If only we were fighting something we understood. Something tangible. Something in three dimensions. I know what you mean. We can only hear them over our radios but I've got a feeling they're with us all the time. Mary. Aren't there three different sets of heads there showing the progress... Yes, that's right. There's Mike Mercury from Supercar. Brains from Thunderbirds and that looks like, I think his name was Captain Green. That's Lieutenant Green, isn't it? Lieutenant Green. This shows the contrast between the Thunderbird puppet which is Gordon here and Captain Scarlet. Gordon is more of a caricature you would say, I suppose. Whereas Captain Scarlet reckons to be in human proportions. So he's got a tiny head. For a puppet. I actually remember everybody was quite excited about the fact that the puppets were much more human scale. Everyone except the puppeteers who hated them. They absolutely hated the smaller heads and the fact that nothing was controllable and, you know, the heads would suddenly go blip, blip, blip. They looked more real and therefore, you were restricted even more because if they did something silly, like a puppet might do, it was totally unacceptable. My point that I always made to Gerry was that the puppets were puppets. Don't try and pretend they're real people. He was always trying to get away, trying to get to reality. Dad always said that he thought the puppets were little bastards and he absolutely hated working with them. The great strength of puppets is that you can have unbelievably outrageous caricatures and you can do lots of things with them that you can't do with actors. But he never realised that. But if he didn't hate them and if he wasn't embarrassed by them then he wouldn't have gone for the level of quality and intricacy that he did end up with. So despite hating them, I think his hatred of them served him quite well. Captain Brown? Captain Brown, are you all right? When special effects and the puppets had to come together the puppet was borrowed from the puppeteers and taken to the special effects stage. There was huge rivalry between the puppeteers and the effects stages. Yes, we were always a bit worried when the puppets were borrowed, that they wouldn't come back as they went away. There was obviously, not rivalry, it was, "Oh, don't blow another one up." "Please, Derek, don't do it." You know, "Don't do this to us, you don't know how long it takes." And he'd shrug his shoulders and laugh about it. Special effects was special effects. Dirty, grubby, foul mouthed, lots of noise. Quite enjoyable. There was a good banter between, you know, uh, all units. We had a meeting once, we were told not to be rude about the puppeteers. It would seem that this Captain Scarlet is now indestructible. This presents us with a clear and exciting expectation that he will become our greatest asset in the fight against the Mysterons. I remember seeing the first episode in the rushes theatre and Mike Trim came out and said, "What do you think of it?" I was a young, green, 19-year-old kid and I thought, well... After Thunderbirds, it was so different. Was it really going to be as big? And I think we all knew deep down, although we all loved what we were doing, nothing would ever emulate the magic that Thunderbirds had. I'm very delighted to have the opportunity to introduce the next film, Thunderbird Six. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Now International Rescue's latest top secret. Thunderbird 6! Back to my days in the cutting room, along came magnetic recording. You'd hold a strip of film and you can't see anything on it but in fact, if you run it through a sensing head, it produced dialogue or whatever it was that was being recorded on it. And I just stared in wonderment because there was a recording on it that I couldn't see but it was apparently possible to wipe that recording and then record something else on the same piece of film. That was what led me to think, "Well, our brains work on electrical impulses." And of course, this was very, very exciting. Professor McClaine's been developing this machine which is called the Big Rat which essentially transfers thought patterns from one person to another. He's approached by a sort of, secret service type government agency who would like to use the machine and his nine-year-old son to spy on other organisations and prevent terrorist activity. The Big Rat was an amazing piece of hardware. I mean, when you see at the beginning of the titles that fantastic, all the tapes whirring and the lights flickering and Joe going into the cage and it all going crazy. It is cool, it is really cool. This boy, you could put him in a machine and he could take the brain of a surgeon. He could be a mathematician. He could be anything, this kid. What kid doesn't want to be a jet pilot? What kid doesn't want to be a secret agent? What kid doesn't want to be king for a day? To me, it is this wonderful sense of a child being able to one-up adults, which is a dream that every child has when you're being controlled by your parents or you're controlled by your teachers. So Joe is this wonderful vehicle for going places that no kid can ever go. They can't really stop me now, Sam. They may try ground to air missiles. And that's just what they're doing, Sam. They're throwing everything they've got at me, I can't chance it. I'm going in to attack the base. Okay, Joe, you're the expert. I mean, it's a horrifying concept by today's standards. You know. It's like you take this little nine-year-old kid and you put all of these brainwaves of other people into his head and he then goes off and kills people. Over here, Colleti. It never occurred to us that we were brainwashing, um... a young kid because it was for the good of mankind. Can I do it, Dad? Can I work with Uncle Sam? Oh, I suppose so. If you're sure you want to. But don't come crying to me if you get hurt. Thanks, Dad. Thanks, Uncle Sam. Mr Weston, can I ask you a question? Why, sure, Joe. What is it? When do I get my badge? Right now, Joe 90. Right now. Action on the door. And down. I am not interested in the excuses for your failure. For hundreds of years puppeteers have had the same problem. All they can see are the strings and the tops of the puppet's head. But by using this system, they can, for the first time, see exactly what an audience can see and it's leading to greater subtly in the puppet movements they create. Gerry had this idea of getting a video camera and sticking it through the eyepiece of the Arriflex. So the camera operator was working it from a monitor. It was much better for us puppeteers because we could look at the screen right in front of us there. Yeah. And see exactly what the puppet was doing. Without looking down on the top of its head all the time. Because they're behind the puppets while the camera is in front, they have a mirror image on their television screens so that when they move the puppet to the left the picture moves to the left too. This puppet studio has been experimenting for years with various electronic video systems attached to conventional film cameras. They'd turn them off for lunchtime, came back from lunch, switch it all on again it was completely haywire, pictures were unviewable. Pictures were rolling over like this or there were squiggles this way and that way, and everybody was fiddling with connectors and shaking the wire all the way down. And then eventually, they'd make a phone call and then some man with a screwdriver would come down. We were always waiting a long time. So much time was lost. It was incredible that, give Gerry his due he stuck at it, he stuck with the theory and it was great. The television picture can also be recorded on videotape. This means that if the director or the cameraman want to check something that's already been filmed they can play it back immediately. Before, if there was any doubt in their minds, they'd automatically have shot the scene again just to be sure. You have to hand the credit to Gerry Anderson for persevering with the video assist because it's now the norm. Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Ignition. This is a sight our screens have made familiar. Lift-off. But now, in this split second of time, you can share an adventure unlikely to be repeated in our lifetime. And so, milady, we're drawing towards the end of our story. The next show was to be the end of the line for Supermarionation. Why was that, Parker? I beg your pardon? Mr Anderbo will explain it. In The Secret Service, Father Stanley Unwin, played by Stanley Unwin, lives with Mrs Appleby his housekeeper and Matthew the gardener. Of course Father Stanley Unwin is actually a secret service agent working for British Intelligence Service Headquarters Operation Priest, with the lovely acronym BISHOP. He has a miniaturisation device built into a bible, obviously. And he goes around foiling, again, terrorist plots and saving the world and saving secret plans from those who really shouldn't have them. Matthew, I'm afraid I may be slightly delayed. If he ever got into a difficult spot, say the police stopped him... Do you realise, sir, that you were exceeding the speed limit? I'm afraid I didn't, officer. He would talk to them in his Unwinese. And of course, that would fox the police totally. They had to be polite and they would say, "Sorry, I didn't quite get that", 'cause they were writing it down. I didn't quite catch that, sir. I'll explain it. I see. And in that way, the police would sort of say, "Yes, yes, I quite understand, sir. Sorry to have troubled you, off you go." All of us at the time, even at the beginning, said, "What?" Again, it was the problem that we couldn't make the puppets walk, and I came up with the idea of getting Stanley Unwin to do all the walking shots and driving shots. In the same way that I used hands to enable puppets to pick things up, I used Stanley Unwin, married to his own puppet, to enable him to do all the things that the puppet couldn't do. You were dealing with both live action and you were dealing with puppets. And from my own point of view, I didn't feel that you could get away with it because they were so different. I think Joe 90 turned out very well but I think the team themselves were beginning to get a little tired. I think there was quite an air of almost depression in the effects studio. Sometimes I wonder if it was us at the top there... losing our grip. Or things not going well with us that reflected. Gerry Anderson, when I first met him, I was very taken. He was another person who was very passionate about the film industry and making films. And sadly, after a few TV series, and he took an office suite at Pinewood, there was a separation and we found ourselves very much the poor relatives over on the Slough Trading Estate. A company reaches its peak in their moment in time and I think our peak was Thunderbirds. I didn't think about it at the time, but looking back now, and thinking, I wonder if it's because we, ourselves were getting a bit divided. Well, I showed, as I showed Lew all the films I made as soon as they were finished, and as soon Stanley Unwin went into his gobbledygook, Lew jumped up... Shouted to the projectionist, "Cut, cut, cut!" "Stop, stop, put the lights up." And he said, "Cancel the show, Gerry." "Just finish off the first 13." I said, "Why?" He said, "Well, people will never... will never understand him in America." And I said, "But, Lew, that's the whole point, they're not supposed to understand." "No, no, no!" And that was the end of that one. The puppet era was definitely, definitely coming to an end. I think we'd already seen the writing on the wall. Lew Grade, um, had a more difficult job on with ATV and all the rest of it, so it's all beginning to fade a bit. It was a big blow when Gerry said we're closing down and, uh, we're just selling everything. It seemed to me as if things were sort of... winding down a bit because the, uh, main crew had gone off to-to make the live action film. Uh, which was obviously much more exciting to Gerry, because it was live action instead of puppets which he'd never really wanted to do. Quite a few of us got together. We tried to talk the powers that be into it, that "Okay, you go off and do the live action series and we can make this work. We can still make this a success. There's no reason to give it up." We really tried hard to keep it going. I don't know whether I was... I was relieved, pleased or disappointed. I can't remember, you know, I think I was all three. Um... Because it was, uh, 12 years. It was 12 years of pure enjoyment really. You have great moments in time and I think it was time to close the shop. What an extraordinary story, Parker. Quite, milady. And such a shame that it should all come to an abrupt end. But tell me, Parker, what happened when the studios closed? A company had been called in to demolish everything within the studios. We had guys with sledgehammers just coming in and dragging all the sets out into the field at the back of the studio and smashing them up and putting them into skips. The fact that everything we'd been doing for the past so many years was being destroyed in front of our eyes, it certainly brought tears to my eyes. And the shock of it happening and the shock that you walked away from the studio on that final day, with a pile of skips behind you which was your last four years work crushed into rubble... was a pretty hard thing to swallow and it left quite a mark on me. I suppose one of my great regrets was when Century 21 finally folded. You looked around the place and you saw this wealth of talent that had been assembled slowly over the years and then suddenly, here was this whole thing being broken up. And it seemed a very sad time to me. It's really good to see, you know, this very, very nice recreation of what it used to be like, and to have brought back all these memories and to get us all here together as well, and, uh, to remember the lots of people that we've loved and had fun with, and some of them who've passed on. And it's just really, really nice. - Yeah. - Thank you. Very good. I was lucky enough to work on the most successful set of TV series for children. And they're still watching now. Fifty years on. They're still good. Entertaining. Yeah, it was fun. I still am so proud of being part of Thunderbirds. I am extremely flattered that I am, in a small way, associated with someone who I think was a creative genius. At the time, we didn't realise we were going to be such an important part of the film history. And, um, and it's really surprising that we are. It was the best time of my life in the film business. Really. The very best. It was just pure joy to be with so many really great people, just who had a zest for life. They were real pioneering days and they were a lot of fun, in fact. It was tough. I nearly had a nervous breakdown in the middle of it. But, you know, I'd do it all again for sure. Would I do it all again? I should have to think very seriously about that one. Well, I think up here, yes, down here, no. Oh, it would be the opposite way round, but anyway. When I was suddenly introduced to this mad lot of people who let me have a wonderful time playing with puppets and at the end of the week they pay you money as well. I personally, like you, I owe him huge amounts. Yeah, we do. - We do. - Huge amounts. - We really do. - We do. - Thank you, thank you, Gerry. - Thank you, darling. - Thank you, Gerry! - Thank you! Could I say something to you, Parker? In your lughole? I'm very grateful to you for all the inspiration you've given me and all the success I've been able to have in the voice field. It's all down to you, Cock. Goodbye. Well, I'm sure sorry you have to leave, Penelope. Well, it seems all good things must come to an end. Home, milady? Home, Parker. And, Parker. Yes, milady? Well done. I wish I was a spaceman The fastest guy alive I'd fly you round the universe In Fireball XL5 Way out in space together Conquers of the sky My heart would be a fireball A fireball Every time I gazed Into your starry eyes We'd take the path to Jupiter And maybe very soon We'd cruise along the Milky Way And land upon the moon To a wonderland of stardust We'll zoom our way to Mars My heart would be a fireball A fireball 'Cause you would be My Venus of the stars But though I'm not a spaceman Famous and renowned I'm just a guy that's down to Earth With both feet on the ground It's all imagination I'll never reach the skies My heart is still a fireball A fireball 'Cause you would be My Venus of the stars
