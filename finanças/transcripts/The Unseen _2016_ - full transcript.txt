Subtitles by explosiveskull She's been acting weird... ...she's distancing herself... ...you said it yourself... Eva. Where are you going? I don't know. What's that's supposed to mean? And what's with those granny gloves? Moll. Eva, we need to talk. They're waiting for me, Mom. Always with this shit. You know she's ditching classes? Yeah, they called. But she's going to graduate, right? I'm going to travel. With Amelia. On what? The money dad sends me? That money is for college and 17 year olds don't travel, kid. I'll be at your game tonight. I won't. I quit. When did that happen? I don't know. We're all she's got. She'll figure it out. Or she'll leave. One fucking inch. If you're taking notes, this is why we call them cants. Stewart, what the Christ, just pinch it off and get down here. This is not happening! Oh really? My back thought otherwise. You enjoy your last day? Cliff's here. Get over here. Show you how to keep the logs on the line. Dude, he's your boss. Oh, he dreamt he was. Woke up knowing otherwise. Keep things moving. Fade into the wallpaper. Hello? Bob? Yup. Wasn't sure this was still your number. Yeah. You and me both. So, how you been? Still working at the mill? Barely seeing three shifts a week. Carry me out there, I imagine, unless they shut it down first. I hope that's not the next time she sees you. What do you want, Darlene? I send you the cheques. Will as long as I'm able. It's not about that. We settled this. We didn't leave. Sorry. She hasn't seen you in 8 years. She doesn't talk. She probably won't go to college. I don't know what to do. She wants to travel. I barely see her as it is. She's just a kid. Yours, Bob. I just finished a brutal shift. I need to go to bed. You didn't even say goodbye. What do you want, Darlene? I want you to be her father. She needs her father. I didn't. If you can't forgive him, what do you expect your daughter will do? Forget me. Where are you going, Bob? Bob, you good? You good? You better be good. Gonna have to fire myself. Again. Bob, how long have you been coming in? I don't know. Been a few years, I guess. Lindi, I... A few years. No shit, Bob. And then some. I know this town. I know your drink. And I know you. Ok. What do you know? You drive that beat to shit pick-up truck. Careful, she's parked out front. Sensitive hearing. You work at the mill. 223 people work at that mill. And you're one of them. Ok. What do I do there? Mill... Shit. I'll give you that. All I'm saying is, no one here gives a shit. You sit at the bar. You leave when it gets busy. I see this. I don't care what your story is. What you're hiding. Or who she is. Smooth like sandpaper. He's got the gift. What can I get you? Beer. Beer. Beer.

You know him? Crisby? Of him. He doesn't usually go out much, but some of his guys got busted. And you probably don't want to tell me shit like that either. He remembers you. In the NHL for five minutes or something? I almost remember me too. When you left? He said that fight? It's online. I thought I was going to puke when I saw what you did to that guy. Yeah... but you see... prices went up. Nelson, it's going to be a long fucking week. So what's that going to get me? Half. Nelson, prices going up is one thing. Double is fucking double. Yeah, but, technically... cuz... um... cuz the... Tell your boss to go fuck himself. Might be a good idea He didn't hear that last part. It's a bearing on the secondary, I think. Must have taken a whack. And? Look, you can chance it till shift's end but you know, if it goes, the whole thing's toast. What do you need? No, I got the parts on me. Get it done. Bob? BOB! What? Do you need Stewart up there? No. Need to be somewhere else. Gotta be somewhere. Need a few days. We'll talk about it at the end of your shift. It's important. If you leave, you will not have anything to come back to. You know, when you come into work tomorrow, I'm not going to be here. Or the day after that. Or the day after that. Fuck it. I might not even come back this week. But when I do, you're gonna ask me how I'm doing. I'm not going to tell you, but you should ask. Ok. Who dat? Nelson? Bob! I need a favour. Truck stop. East of town. Men's room back there? Last place I saw it. May you should... Can I get a cup of coffee, please? Coffee, please. Nelson's not coming. You all right? Ducky. So, uh, what's the story?

We're not so fixy. Um... did you eat? No, I'm fine. Do you want to take a shower? Cuz we still have that. You know, I should probably get a place, before it's too... No, please. You can stay here. Moll's on the road and it's fine. Couch is good. I can get you a blanket, or something. Hey kiddo. Mom know you're here? Yup. Came in last night. What's that? Just something I brought down for a friend. Didn't think you still had any. I'll take what I can get. You coming in? Yeah, in a bit. I gotta get this... Tell your mom I had to go out. Where?

A right prospect and then.... Sit. Crisby calls. He's got a problem. Sends you down. I topped up the ice. Good. Worth a lot what Crisby puts in that box. You get you're working for a moron? The finer points of business elude him. It's part-time. Bearings? Bushings, I figure. That there is a bit light. But he'll get it. Bishop's sorry about the ribs. Chinese gave me that. For my back. It works. Dismissed. Hey, uh, sorry about before. Why are you here? Your mom, she... I wanted to see you. She called, didn't she? Why now? I don't know. Better than too late. And if we're already there? What are you listening to? Did you get into a fight? No... Then what's that? I hurt some ribs at work. That friend gave me this. He thought it would help. Does it? I don't know. I doubt it. I don't like doctors. Well, what's to like? I'll let you know. What kind of crazy was Grandpa? The I don't give a shit kind of crazy. He killed himself. He opted out. I don't know what they called it then. Bipolar, maybe. I'd better run. I've got friends waiting. Maybe later we could do something? Hang out? Yeah, maybe. You met Moll? Not yet. Good luck with that. You know what you need? I'm just looking. You know what that's for? Constipation. You need? Chinese medicine comes from thousands of years. In everything. Plants. Animals. Special qualities can heal. Natural. This is for energy. Young people already have too much. I don't think this is for you. This is for eyes. That's for men's problems. This is for skin. You have young skin. Clear.

Why wouldn't you go to an abandoned mental hospital? It's awesome. He's got it I'm going. Ok, fine. Tim! Don't be a pussy, Timothy! Come on! He's smarter than all of us. Come on! We can still go to the mall! You're not getting out of this. We're going to die. We're all going to die. WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!! You're being dramatic. This place has a bus route? Yeah, some of it's still running. Seriously? Do you think I can stay over again? Yeah, of course. Need a break from the moms? What about Wayne? Fuck him. It's fine. Oooooh... I don't want to do this. Yo. Dude. Fucking hands. FUCK OFF! Come on... It's like a prison for crazy I'm definitely not going crazy. There were a lot of people here. This place ran for like 90 years. It was a TB clinic in the '50s. They didn't know what to do with them. I guess they were dangerous. I wiki'd it. Wiki this. My grandfather was here. Was he...? He was ill. So that's why we're here. There's got to be some old files or something. Not likely. I want to see a ghost. We are so going down. Yeah, you do that. Guys, what's down there? Guys! This place is supposed to be haunted. Benji likes Sorry about your grandpa? He died before I was born. Hey Benji, slow up. Jesus! What the...??? What the fuck?? That's your ghost! When this place shut down, some of the patients stayed. They live on the grounds. They're like homeless. They're harmless. It's fine. Am... Am.. it's ok, it's ok. No I told you. I said this was a stupid idea. It's ok. We'll leave. Now. Oggy? Ok. Benji. We're going back. Ok? It's ok. Eva... What's wrong with you? I can explain! Go! Go! Go! Come on! Come on! Come on! We have to go! Don't touch me!! No. I remember. It happened right there. No, it wasn't. It was around the corner. I was there! I fucking remember! You know what's stupid? I keep thinking about the time she got it in her head to walk to school alone. Oh good lord, yeah... You lost your shit that day. She was six! She made her own lunch. Tell me you weren't proud of her. I was just surprised she didn't take the car. You encouraged her... You would have had her driving by 14, If you... I don't know what I'm supposed to do here. She's grown up. She... No... she's getting there, but she's still a kid. She was not happy to see me. She doesn't really know you. Well, I don't know if I'd have anything she'd want. You're her father. Like that's going to get me very far. So what did you tell her? I told her that you leaving wasn't her fault. And that, no matter how much people love each other, sometimes they just can't be together. And that you love her. You coated it in sugar. Fuck you. What did you want me to tell her? Hey, I can't get to the phone right now but leave a message. So, what'd they say? She's not answering. Well we know that. It's probably her cell phone battery and you're going to wear it out if you keep calling like that. So what did the cops say? They said that it was too soon. What is that supposed to mean? It means she's 17 and it was the weekend. It's not like her. She'll be a little shit but not like this. Yeah, I told them And? They asked if she has a boyfriend. Does she? No, if she had a boyfriend I'd know where to look. She'll come home. Amelia said she hasn't seen her since yesterday. Is she the type to do this? No Bob, she's not one to just fuck off and not tell us. Not overnight. Look I phoned the hospitals... If this is because of you... Moll! No, he just comes in here... Stop it! I called him. I'm going to go to the police station. That way, when they're ready, they'll have photos, whatever else they need. I'll come with you. Eva? No, it's Bob. I've got Eva's phone. What? Let me see that. Why is this here? She always has this. It was stashed in her room, broken. I had it fixed. Now these kids. They all went somewhere together. Amelia was with her. Come on. Thought you didn't have one. It's a loaner. It's fucking Wayne's truck. He should be in Fort Mac. Eva didn't say he was back. We never would have let her stay over if we knew. Wayne. Wayne! Heard you the first time. Is Eva here? How do I know who's coming and going here. It's only my house. Jesus! Langmore! You look like shit! Is Eva here? Why, is she your kid again? Can we talk to Amelia? No. How's the homecoming going there, Bob? Pride of the fucking hood. How did you fuck all that up? Is she here? I don't know where they are. Kid doesn't know half the time herself. Really, Bob? You lost that to a dyke? You're an asshole! Hope you find her where she's meant to be! Otherwise best find her soon! Bobby? Did you get there ok? What are you doing? This isn't going to be like this. Well, I'm just worried about you is all. Don't. Easy, Hockey. All I'm asking for is an update. That's my job. I got it. Nice. Don't call again. Whoah! When I said, take your time, I might have been optimistic. Yeah? That's not my problem. You know my daughter? Should I run? You tell me. Eva. She doesn't have a dad. Got two moms. You're not too smart are you? Where's Eva? Maybe she's dodging you, asshole. Where did you take her? What? Well, you all went somewhere. That was nothing. Hey. Hey! She didn't come home last night. What? Where is she? Fuck it. Mountainview. Mountainview? Why would she go there? We were screwing around. Bored and shit. I don't know. She wanted to go. Hey, was it your old man who was crazy or hers? There's two things I don't care about you. One is your whining. The other is how many decades you've been an asshole. Get off him!! Where is my daughter? I don't know, we split up! So you left her there? No! So you left with her? No! You know how many bones there are in a hand? Jesus, Bob! She went to Mountainview. What? She asked me about my goddamn father. What did you tell her? Nothing. Bullshit! NOTHING! Whoah, sporto! Where you going? Can you help us? Our daughter was here with some friends? I couldn't say. Why's that, Sporto? We chase kids out of here all the time. Probably don't see half of them. Bullshit. We don't have enough staff... Do you hear yourself? Excuse me? The shit coming out of your mouth. She might be in there, hurt. She didn't come home last night. Look, if she was here, we would have seen her. Go ahead, call police... Here's a plan. Why don't you go ahead and fuck yourself. Who's in charge? Our daughter was here, on your grounds, with friends. She didn't come home. Move away from the desk! This guy's a fucking asshole. Please, our daughter was here. She's missing. Sir, you need to step back and relax. Why is it so fucking hard. Get off him! We're just trying to find our daughter! Enough. I've spoken with security. They confirmed one of our guards may have seen Eva, but she was not detained. We are going to hold your husband. Oh, Jesus. Bob isn't well. He could have hurt someone or himself. Please. Let us help him. Our daughter is missing And the police will find her. I'm sure Bob's coming back would have been upsetting for her. You are unbelievable. I'm sorry. I'll follow you out. You take him. Our security has checked the grounds. The police have too. If your daughter was here, she isn't now. We're quite certain of that. Then I have to go. Find her. You remember me, don't you Bob? This place? Your father's accident? It was no accident. Is that what your mother... Told me? No. She didn't talk about it. But I saw him do it. I'd like to show you something. Come. Why do you think he did it? I figure the prick had somewhere better to be. He did. Here. Bob. Your father was burned severely. But he lived. No. I saw him. He meant to die. To conceal it. To spare you from what would come if he was discovered. No one else needs to know. Bobby? Get him out of here! He can't see me like this. I believe his condition was a factor in his survival. Although, the trauma most likely accelerated it. I couldn't stop it, but... I kept him safe. I gave him a life, here in this room. He watched you play. All your games. You studied him. Trying to understand it. Did you charge admission? I kept his secret. So what happened? To your friend? He suffered from deep depression. There were good days, but there were not so good days. He left. To finish what he started. It's not too late for you. We can give you a good life here. Please let us help you. What, to pick up where you left off? To make your career? You're going to write a book? It's not much of a show without a freak. I'm not him! Look at yourself. Your progression. You can't pass out there much longer. They won't understand. This room is not where Eva needs me. You are here for 72 hours. I'll give you something to help you sleep. Consider what I'm offering you. I need your belt, your shoes and all your personal possessions. Well come and get 'em. Eva's not here. Hey, uh... Twenty get me that? That'll do it. How the hell did you get out? Someone figured I didn't need to be there. Where's Darlene? She's out.. It's your number. Hello? No it's not, who's this? An old buddy? Yeah? Hi Bob! Nice place you got here. How's the family? How's the kid? How's the ex? Y'all go to the PNE? What you are doing? I've got nothing to keep my girls working so I'm taking steps. That's what I do when you don't answer your fucking phone. I got your stuff, just calm down Don't you fu...! I know... I will... I know I will. Do I have to come down there, Bob? To your house? Get shit done? If you come near my family, I... Don't fucking talk to me like that! We have an arrangement. Fuck you. What have you done? What I had to do. No. You need to get out of here. Darlene is trying to get you out of a mental hospital when she should be looking for Eva. Wait. No. I'm not going to be one of those parents they drag on the news to look for their kid who went missing five years ago. I'm not going to let you do that to us. Go! Let the police do their jobs and stop fucking with our lives you piece of shit. Wayne! What's the fuck with you again. Where's Eva? I thought it was your turn to watch her. Eva! Get the fuck off my porch. Get the fuck out of my house! You like to scare them, huh? Young girls? Is that your thing now? Is that what you think? Plenty to screw where I'm working. I don't fuck kids! She's not here. What the fuck is wrong with you? Hey. Are you all right? He's a prick but it's not like that. It's better when Eva's here. I found Eva's phone. I know you went to Mountainview. I don't care. That isn't her phone. Look. I didn't want to go. But she said she had to. Why isn't this Eva's phone? Benji broke it. On the way there. After you came straight back here, she stayed over with you. No. I mean before, but not last night. I found this in her room. I had it fixed. She came home. Where is she? I don't know. We had a fight. I was scared! I didn't want to get it. She said it wasn't like that. That she had something for it. That she was going to get better. She has to be ok. She's my best friend. I don't care if she's sick. What do you mean, she's sick? She's like you. I'm sorry. Please, you have to find her. She forgot her bag. She needs it! Calling the cops on your ass, Bob! Amelia! Get in the house. Now! Didn't think we'd see you here again. Where did this come from? Some dumb guy! My daughter had that. And? What do you know about young girls who go missing 'round here? What is it you think I do here? Oh, I'm not making accusations. But I'm asking. I've got grandchildren. I just wanted to build things. Sir, can I help you? This is from here, right? I believe so, yes. Is there a problem? My daughter had that. What is it? What does it do? That is confidential. Patients are confidential. Take a look here. She came here because of me. Have you seen her? I don't know. Oh, don't do that. This is your store. That's your sign. That's her bike. She didn't come home? Goddammit I just told you! What are you? I don't know. You are legend. Is she like you? I prayed that she wouldn't be. We help people. The doctor is good! He wouldn't do that! Bob? Where's my daughter? Where's my daughter! Tell me! I know she's here! Dad! Dad, I'm in here! Dad please... Dad, it's me! Dad? Baby no, it's me. It's me. It's ok. Come on. It's ok. Sorry. You're bleeding. What did he do? My sweet girl. She's just a child. My little girl. What have you done??? Dad, please. Let's just leave. Dad, I want to go. You're a monster! Please, dad! This could help her! Go! Hurry! 911. What is the nature of your emergency? Hello? Mom! Mom! You ok? I'm ok, but Dad's hurt. Moll! Molly! Bob? Bob what happened? I'm calling an ambulance. No, help me get him inside. Mom, no. It's ok. Mom! Honey, it's ok. It's ok, it's ok. What are you doing? He can't be alive. I'm calling an ambulance. No! Get a needle, thread... ...tape, gauze, alcohol... You're going to have to trust me. He's not there. Keep the pressure on here. Keep it tight. How could you keep this from me? Would you have believed her? It wasn't mine to share. Sweetie, come here. Let me take a look at your shoulder. It's ok. You're ok. Hey careful. You should be inside. I need to get some air. Your mother's quite the seamstress. Yeah, she sewed me up too. Hurt like a motherfucker. Hey. Come on. Mouth. Really? Sounds wrong. When did it start? Two, three months before I left. That's why you quit hockey. Yeah. And you? I had to drop gym. And soccer. I thought it was only me. So did I. So did grandpa. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You shouldn't be out here. You should be resting. Yup. Look, I found some old antibiotics. They should help. And Moll had these for her back. Is that what I'm riding? Yeah. Cool. I called the cop shop. I told them you were with a boyfriend we didn't know about. But they need to see you. This afternoon. You up for that? I don't know. Come on. You've got to go. Show them you're safe and sound. Ok. Yeah. Don't let him stay out here too long. Are you stupid? Bob. You can't. I have to go. If I don't go now, I won't be able to. No. You can't. Eva. She's just scared. She's young. You help her. Give her that tea. She's convinced there might be some good in it. I don't know. Bob, give me that. Keep her safe, hey? You always have. I'll be watching you. No. Absolutely not! No. He's got to get home. He can't drive. Don't be ridiculous. I'm taking you. Eva. Mom. She'll be fine up there. No one will find her. This piece of shit going to get you up there? Got me here. Watch her. She's got a heavy foot. Good to know. Call me as soon as you get up there. Let me know you're safe. Yeah, I will. Your dad and I will work everything out. I love you. I love you. I love you too. Take care of your father, ok? Buckle up, kid. How'd you do it? What? Leave us. My father left. I hated him. I couldn't let my problems become yours. So I reached into my chest. And I tore out my heart. Aimed the truck north. You missed a lot. We gotta make a stop. Is that him? Yeah. Oh yeah. Here. Look at me. Make-up? This works for you? Yeah. But I am a girl. Trust me. It works. Oh yeah. Yeah. What's that? Nothing. Stay in the car. You ok, man? You look like hell. Who's she? She's not here.

Go where? Eva. I'm not getting any better. You will. At the mill, I can disappear. What does that mean? It's time. What does that mean? Dad. Dad, wait! You dragged me up here to live in that box! You can't just leave me alone! Please, I need you. Before I came down, I was ready to go to do this. I needed to see you. I needed to say goodbye. No. No. Dad. Please! You can't leave me alone! Don't do this! Who the fuck...? Where's Bob. Where's Bob. I need to talk to Bob. Bob's gone. The hell he is. He left. The fuck he did. Hey, Bob! Come on, Bobby! He sold me this place. Oh yeah? You don't say. And all his stuff, too? Yeah. Yeah. Bobby. As if. You shouldn't be here. Fuck you, Bob. Old Bobby proved he wasn't worth two shits in a handbag. He fucked up my network. Milton's done with my bears. Burn a buyer? But that's on Bob. Who's gone. But... you are here. In his place. With all his stuff. Young thing like you. Lots of different ways to settle up. What the...? I'm not for horsing around. Then you should leave. The fuck is going on here. Dad.... Why couldn't you leave it. Let us alone. No. But you had to. Dad. It's all right. I killed him. Come on, Dad, you had to. He was going... he was... ...an asshole. You came back. I'm so sorry. I couldn't leave you. Not again. You're bleeding. Your stitches. It's ok. I'm going to be all right. I'll be all right. I'm not going anywhere. What are we going to do with him? Here you go. Have a good day. They might have some shifts for you, if you're still looking. No. I'm just passing through. These people are weird. Oh really? Drink your magic tea. Tastes like dirt. Hey. A lot of good things come from dirt. Do you remember that time you were six, you walked yourself to school? Yeah...? Well, I never told you mom but I followed you. Found you right off, but let you keep going. You were watching me? I got in a lot of trouble for that. You still did it. My father said his last words to me. He didn't want me to see him like this. All these years, I thought he meant dying. So, what are you saying? Somebody got me out of Mountainview. Shit. I think those words weren't his last. We should go ask him. Subtitles by explosiveskull
