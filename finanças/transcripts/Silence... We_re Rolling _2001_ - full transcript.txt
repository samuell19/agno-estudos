Silence... We're rolling You will love Mom's dress. He already loves her. If you know the words of your poetry If you know the smell of the roses If you can live in the modern world Then you are indeed an Egyptian, I can tell If you can sing in Arabic In the name of God and our country If you can give warmth and brightness You are indeed an Egyptian, I can tell The Egyptian loves with a burning flame He finds happiness in the smallest things He is wholeheartedly dedicated to whom he loves And can escape maledictions Mahfouz the poet sings at the pace of Zouel's heart Halim the troubadour is taking you And you will never forget Halim the troubadour is taking you And you will never forget Oum Kalthum Oum Kalthum and her pink handkerchief Her songs pass through generations They give boldness and courage Malak! Your husband wasn't there. And he will never be again. Abbas has no time for me, he is in love. He seemed resigned. What happened to him? He loves Dina. Your best friend? Men always have a "best friend". Dina is not that pretty. Does it make any difference? Weird way of thinking, Mom! Your husband wasn't a good choice of subject. We're going to the restaurant with Alfi and Paula, join us. These jewels are so itchy. Let me go to the villa first. You know, you have been wonderful tonight. Tell me... Where will Malak dine tonight? She's treating her crew. It's only for us. I'm invited too, but I don't get where the place is. Too bad. I can't tell anything. Congratulations for your last movie! Don't forget, we will dine at La Bodega! Hurry up! Yes, I'll sprint... I'm in my car, sitting next to my grand-daughter. But what are you doing here? I4m replacing my father. He is ill. You are the driver's son? So you're back from Alexandria? You became such a grown man! I won't steal these. - Did I say so? - You thought so! Rich persons are always scared. - Are you a communist? - I think of poor people. I think of them too, since I'm giving them money. In other words I'm a rich Red. Rich people do charity with money they stole. What are people like you looking for? What game are Reds playing? A game that will ruin you. Nasser tried, when he was alive. Nasser is not dead. Are you his reincarnation? My name is Nasser, hate it or love it. How daring! If I were in a bad mood I would kick you out of my car! Is the devil following you? I'm preparing my thesis. I need to read so many books. And you're waiting for the last minute? You loafer! That's no reason to kill us! You can dine with us if you want. We will have shrimps. See how simple we are. Thanks but I have work to do. I'm actually not a loafer. - A loafer? Did I say so? - More or less. So it must be true. Past 70 year-old one is always right. Meet me in the garage. I love you. And I love your granny... What a pain! You provoked her. Self-defense. She is from another world. She's mixing up rich and communist just to make fun of me. Maybe she can see you just like I see you. A good boy. Handsome... Wrecked and devolved. Stop, temptress! If I fail my thesis I will kill myself. Hello? Dad? Nasser! Where are you? Are you coming to the diner? We'll celebrate the premiere at La Bodega. Okay. I'll wait for you. Dad is on the highway. He's coming. Dad's coming, Granny's dressing up... I can't stand them! Nasser! Nasser! Nasser! - Who will take us there? - Take a cab. And go home with your mother. With a thesis, do you remain a driver's child? Your grand-father was a driver. What's wrong with that? Once he was rich, there was no more contempt. Nasser talked to you in the garage. Don't lie. I'm neither stupid nor blind. I know why you spent so much time in Alexandria. Your Nasser was there. Please venerate my perspicacity. Do you love him? Since I'm a kid. So what? Why would you be ashamed of a scholar? Are you dumb? Tell him we're coming. - He left? - Left? To where? - Who will take us there? - He said to call a cab. What a shitty marriage! The groom is such a tightwad! Call me for the divorce picture. I will give you twice more for two pictures with Malak. Tabloids' pictures. - A call from the Elys?e. - I'll leave you for a moment. I pretexted a call from Jacques Chirac. She is our host. I never eat before a concert. Of course. An artist is devoted to his public. He forgets everything else. Your gestures are magic... Even the way you eat your shrimps. You fingers, caressing their flesh... It's poetry. Music. You are a dream that has been obsessing me since my childhood. President Mitterrand decorated me Officer of Arts and Letters. Who are you? Doctor Jean-Jacques Lemay. I'm from Alexandria. I have a French passport too. I studied psychology in Paris. Are you healing broken hearts? There is only room in your heart for happiness. Wake up and write and new screenplay for Malak. - My muse is sleeping. - Wake her up. I wish I could. The problem is I can't find inspiration. Hello? Hello? Youngsters... Flirting with their cellphones. Look at you. Do you think you're any better? You can't even declare your love to Malak. Don't be insane, Malak is married. Married without a husband... Don't pretend you don't know. Who is lumpier, you or one of those nerds? Look at her, flirting with the inventor of the Internet. Who is it? I don't like his face. Mister Internet. I would like to know what your hobbies are. My hobbies? I sing. I have to admit I like to sing too. God gave me a good appearance, and I wish you could hear my voice. - Mom, Dad is coming. - Who? Abbas. Your husband, my father. Do you remember? - He wants to talk to us. - Will he finally explain? Is he hiding something? He's coming. You will see. Please excuse me a minute. Paula! Paula! How are you doing? - I'm embarrassed. - Because of me? - Because of you. - Why is that? I came to tell you. Tell me, Dad. I'm in love and I'm gonna get married. I said it, thanks God. Being in love at my age my seem ridiculous. I'm marrying Dina. You're divorcing Mom? Did she hurt you? Never. But my life would have come to an end if I hadn't met Dina. I would have remained Mister Malak and never found my real self. Now that you're a grown up I feel like I can do so. Her work is all her life. That's why she doesn't need me. Happy birthday. It's not my birthday. It's mine. I didn't exist before I met you. You are still young and handsome. - Dina is right. - Let's talk about Paula. Did you talk to her? Will she live with us? Maybe it would be better, at first. Paula doesn't like me. She will abandon me. Take my mother instead. - Paula loves you, but... - But what? If you were in love with someone, it would be a shock for her. Dina and you is not a shock? She knows Dina and likes her. Why wouldn't she love the one that loves me? With a daughter like Paula, you can't make any mistake. - Only she is important. - You talk like a judge. Paula deserves a normal life. Is sleeping is separate bedrooms normal? Is it because of my work? So I deserve to be abandoned. If she wants to live with you, I won't oppose. Stop your comedy. You live for you audience and Paula suffers from it. She suffers? Paula? I don't understand. Explain me. She has a constant inner-struggle. How refined, you're a psychologist too?! You only miss medals. I made your trousers longer. I will sew it. I'll manage. Be careful. The ambassador loves this one. Don't put my in trouble. Don't you get started. I had 10 tuxedos, but the princess ruined them all. Hysteric and jealous. Good riddance. I have one principle, Mom: nobody is indispensable! This bitch is not worth one inch of Malak. She took advantage of me. Do you realize? I knew her since she was a baby. Give my 50?, I need to pay. - What about yesterday's money? - I paid the photographer. It will be shown in tabloids. Give me some. I'm not the Bank of Egypt. - Give me some jewels then. - No! It brings bad luck. "Who disperses its goods has nothing left." Does this saying really exists? No, I just made it up. Give me the cash. Are you sure Malak fell for you? You are a marvelous dream. A dream! Marvelous. What will you do after your thesis? Get married? There are dozens of jobless scholars. How could I dream of a house or a housemaid? Hello. Paula? Grandma locked herself is her room. I'm alone. Dad decided to divorce Mom. Do you have secrets? Paula's Dad wants a divorce. A great lawyer can't stay in the shadow. Why did he marry her then? Before I call you, I was thinking of you. When you are not here... Near me... I feel lost. I want to be with you, hear your voice. Be with you, that's all. I want that too. See you and hear your voice. But I need to get my thesis with a mention to have such plans. Then you will create your revue and we will find a house. For you and me. We won't need anyone else, right? Right. But no tears. Okay? I want to see your charming smile. I will call you as soon as I can. Aren't you angry? Let them write what they want. I don't care. The sad thing is that the two of us are alone. I should have divorced 15 years ago. I could have chosen anyone I wanted. Why didn't you do so? To give my Paula a normal childhood. Come in. Pardon me, Madam. I was ask to deliver you this. "What does the divine thinks of this?" An admirer? It's good to feel important to somebody. "Why not call this Melody? Telephone..." Who sent this? The man on this picture. He seems to be a good man. Does he? So we agree. Ezz Eddine is here. With the film his has to finish and Alfi's new screenplay, He will need at least 2years. 2 years? That long? That's how he works. He looks at the world... How people live... He explains his idea to Alfi. And Alfi answers he is an idiot. How pretentious... There are plenty of screenplays. I wrote one myself, with a beginner.. The shooting may begin tomorrow if I felt like it. Who would direct it? You can't improvise cinema. You are right. What was I thinking? Sir, the bill. It's for me. Thank you. A psychologist that cannot find his words... What a disaster... Let's switch roles. You will be the artist. I will be the doctor. I saw your last film at least 40 times. I imagined myself singing with you. Do you like music that much? I resigned from the hospital to devote myself to singing. - We are ready, master. - Is Malak ready? When you decide... Don't forget your promise. You promised you would test Lamey. I will take care of him after this take. Stay focused. We'll see later. Everybody get ready! Dancer, on stage. Send the smoke! More! Faster! Action! My love The words "I love you" Are all my life The refuge of my certitudes. Take away, take away, everything is going fast Come what may! Don't think about it and live for me. Keep it, it brings bad luck. It is about Sir Lamey's test. Don't worry, all will be fine. He ignored me. Not even a "yes" or "no". Be patient. Believe me, you will have your chance. When? Don't worry, I'll take care of it. May I take you somewhere? There is no place I'd like to go. I call And you call I sing And you sing You laugh, your laugh echoes in my veins. Come closer Your eyes will take me In another world, hunted by the crowed A sight will tell Declare your love Another sight won't reveal a thing A sight will tell Declare your love Another sight won't reveal a thing I'm the boss of the neighbourhood The number one The king of foxes I'm the boss of the neighbourhood I'm the boss of the neighbourhood Stronger and stronger The best of the best No principle, so scruples I greet everybody I'll ditch the one that resist She will be forgotten tomorrow I love you and I dream of closing my eyes Close my eyes and wake up later Wake up and discover that your arms Embraced me and took me away Kidnapped me, took me away Took me far away Far, away from everything I'm the number one, boss of the neighbourhood I'm an expert in economy Tactic and counter-tactic Against misery and idiocy Maybe, be dancing, I will be able to tell you The words hidden in my heart For so long Finally tell you I love you These words that, for you, Just sound like any other ones But for me, my love, The words "I love you" Are all my life The refuse of my certitudes Take away, take away, everything is going fast Come what may! Don't think about it and live for me. I love you and I know That you are away from me You are close but it is like you are afar You live for your dream And your dream is loneliness I love you and I fear That my words of love Will reach your heart Only too late So you will whine You will weep useless teardrops You will whine You will be the one to blame Be aware that I will pursue you Until the end of times Is Madam looking for something? - No, I want to buy you a lunch. - I can't accept. I need to talk to you. Let's eat ribs. Do you have ribs? - I saw your son. Did he tell you? - Not at all. He thinks highly of himself. He was the head of the students' mutual fond. Always first of his class. He will teach at the university, as I always dreamed of. He's handsome. Who does he look like? How nice... He looks like his mother. I want him to taste our sharkassieh. He and the food... He has something else in mind: create his magazine, "Young Egypt". I can pay for that. Maybe, but you won't like what he will write. - That's my problem. - He's as stubborn as his father. Forget about the magazine and the sharkassieh. I want him for Paula. There are a perfect couple. This is madness! Me alive, it will never happen! I forbid it! Sit down. Neither your nor I can do anything about it. This is about love. - Paula loves him. - How do you know? Women's secrets. She loved him since she was 12. She met him every weekend in Alexandria. It's a catastrophe. What's the matter? Don't you like money? If it's earned by work, yes. But from a marriage, no. - You drool like an old man. - I'm old. I'm not! Nasser will dine with us. He'll eat sharkassieh. I'll pay for his magazine and he'll marry Paula! Don't get mad at me. Stop making a beggar of me. Tell him! I bet Paula won't live here nor with his father. Really? Who told you so? She's getting married. With a good boy. I consented, even though his name is Nasser. This house needs a man. I won't contradict you. I invited him for diner. You'll see him tonight. Prepare yourself. What, do you have plans tonight? I wanted Ezz and Alfi to meet Lamey. Who is Lamey? A young talent. You saw him at La Bodega. The cake guy! Invite who you want. If there is enough for two... Even though the Lamey doesn't inspire me. Make an effort. Doctor Lamey deserves it. Doctor? Om Ahmed, I want the diner served exactly at 8:30. It will be ready at 8. I said 8:30! Play. You cheat too, Alfi? This dangerous beauty is my daughter. I hope you think we look alike. But she is more willing than I am. She only listens to herself. A yes is a yes, a no is a no. I need to be surrounded by people who love me. You are a psychologist, help me not to depend on other people. I could, but it would be a shame to change the slightest part of you. Your admirers would lose your spontaneity, your limpidity, your generosity, your smile... Do you hear? Finally somebody who says pleasant things. - The public loves you. - Should I be in love with a crowd? I want someone... who loves me only. This is my right. Don't you think? Solitude is the price of success. You lover her too, don't you? If you love her, say so! Love is not reactionary. Lenin himself was married. Kid, don't play the left-wing card with me. The national revolution destroyed my family. I met and married a brilliant man. In the socialist time, he was a socialist. In the liberal time, he was "open". With businessmen, he did business. He understood the game and became better than them. He ended up with this... And this... And two flats in Paris, one in London, one in New-York, and one in Moscow. And a villa in Tel-Aviv? Enough! Spare me your patriotic lessons. Listen to me, Majesty... Live the life you want. But I man a free man, too. I'm not a shirt sold at a clearance sale. So we disagree. Good evening. Wait! Imbecile! Hold this. - Did you see. - Yes but I didn't hear. Did he say no? Nobody dares disagreeing with me. What if I agreed with him? He doesn't even wait for my judgment! Sit down. Leave it there. Too bad for him. Who brought bad luck today? Him. His picture is everywhere. Why did you invite him? You abandoned Malak, she invites who she wants to. The giant invites the dwarf? Dwarf? He's as tall as the Cairo Tower. I'm tall too. And I'm ready to buy implants! - Tell me, Lamey... - He is a doctor in psychology. Tell me, doctor... Did this vocation to be an actor came all of a sudden? Aren't you 40 already? No, 39. Since childhood... Why chose psychology? Did the conservatory burnt? What's wrong with changing one's life if the talent is here? I have 60 students waiting to be given a chance. You want me to play with children? Why upset me? This is a sacred work. I forbid you to sully it! "Since childhood..." "If I had a chance..." Bullshit! Where is the vocation? It depends on the director. Excuse me. I'm in a bad moon. Your mother is going too far with Ezz. It's not acceptable. Is shouting acceptable? - You're jealous of Lamey. - Jealous? Mom can't love you on demand, can she? This guy is weird. Being an actor is not a game. It's a commitment to the audience. Talk about Mom. I'm not committed. Not even to the driver's son? Okay, you go with Grandma to the university. You will see the driver's son become a teacher. And you will embrace his hand. - I'm tired of this reception. - And I'm tired of morons. To hell with this diner! What an idea to wear this broach! This is how bourgeois' parties are. Let's go somewhere else. You are right. Mom, I won't be home too late. I have a screenplay. Should I tell you? Yes, at this point... An old lady, pretty but with too many money, lives with her two daughters. One falls in love with a crook and the other one with the son of a driver. And a rude scribbler ruins their secret... to write a screenplay and make money out of it. You are ignoble! Never talk to me again! Tell me! What happens next? Why take me to this gloomy street? Come in. I want you to remove this veil. It hides this subjugating look. I hope my presence was not your burden. This is my house more than their. I have to apologize for Ezz's vulgarity. He doesn't understand people anymore. On the contrary. I could not control my looks. He guessed what I did not dare say. Since your opening your hearts... I can admit... You are the light of my life. I'm happy I could escape from this suffocating diner. Who was suffocating? The little girl in you who wants to be free. Our dreams at night reveal our true desires. If these desires are repressed, suffering waits for us and frustration kills us. - Tell me your dream. - Mine? Who can you have confidence in if not your lover? I had a dream once... It's dumb, I shall warn you. I was a bird, sitting on a branch. I was singing, happily, all alone... Suddenly, another bird came. I wasn't alone anymore. This bird kept coming, staring at me. And suddenly... Go ahead. It started singing with me. Is that all? Was this dream pleasurable? It became more than a dream. You were so happy it obsessed you, haunted you... You played it again indefinitely. Make this dream come true. Became a little girl once again. Come. Come out. What are you doing? Where are you going? - Come. - Where are you taking me? What if someone sees us? Why are you laughing? My stomach aches so bad. Doesn't your stomach ever ache? Cancel your rehearsal. The shooting can stop for a day or two... Or three... Stomach ache? Bullshit. She will ruin us. Did she see a doctor? Of course she saw one! She will be back in two days. She said three. Three days of shooting lost. It's okay, the production will still make millions. Her last movie was a flop. But look who was the director... - She came back to you. - Are you sure? Grandma? - What did the doctor say? - What doctor? The stomach aches. May the pain torment you and your ancestors! She just called me. She said you're shooting near the sea. That the place is great and that everything is all right. You're the one in need of a doctor! A doctor... Or maybe a psychiatrist. Impossible... I will die if I don't finish this screenplay. And deprive mankind of a masterpiece. You moron. Go to sleep! The jury will deliberate. Verdict in 15 minutes. The jury, after deliberation, recommends... to give the title of Doctor to Abdel Nasser Hassan, and combine it with a mention and an honorific medal. Bravo! Bravo! I knew it! I knew it! What? Didn't you stop shaking yet? Smile! Why the tears? He is my son! And you, why do you cry? My God... He is my grand-daughter's husband! I've been obeying for three months. "Execute!" and It execute. "Use the barbells", I use them. "Study dance", I dance. And I don't mention solfege, at least four hours a day. I'm fed up. If you're given a chance you will be ready. I can go far using "if...". I spoiled three months because of "if..." I've been working everyday since the age of 12. I won't wait 12 years for Ezz Eddine's offer. Nobody can treat me like this. - The princess was mine. - Who is that? An old hysteric patient. Your Ezz is selfish. He only works for himself. Remember the diner? I made a compliment to you and he went mad. You know what we will do? Summer is coming. I will invite Ezz to my mother's villa. He will read your screenplay. He will say he is overwhelmed and has 50 films to do already. You're in such a bad moon. I have good reasons. This is the end of the month. I'm penniless. The owner of the hotel knocks on my door ten times everyday. I will pay him when I leave. Thank you, this is one problem less. But depending on you... I feel impotent. Incapable of giving you what you deserve. Take a swimsuit. Swimming will be good for you. The coast is clear. - You read your role in this screenplay? - This is a romantic woman. There are barely 15 minutes with you, at the beginning. Who wrote this? A great man, awarded by the Institute of Cinema. Lamey helped him a bit. More than a bit. The movie is all about him. I should be crazy to accept to direct this. You are this guy's servant. You hear me? He supports me. Really? He manipulates you! He thinks he is a national hero. He knows nothing about writing. He is a psychologist that doesn't understand human nature. You worked for 15 years to have this career. If you want to ruin it all, it's your choice! I'm not your mother, neither your babysitter nor your tutor. Do what you want. I'm out of this madhouse. I thought you were my friend. Your friend, yes. A cuckold, no. He had never been so rude to me. - He's worried about you. - He shouldn't, I have my job. It's not enough. You have become a servant. You lie to us and to yourself. You don't realize Lamey is using you! Is it so unbelievable that he loves me? Am I misshapen? Insensible? Doesn't sincerity exist? Answer. Me too... I'm worried too... Because somebody is writing screenplays for me? Now you are mad at me. It's true. When I write, I often think of you. Does that mean I'm your property? Maybe we don't understand each other. I told you about my feelings because I thought you would understand me. I'm more than a friend to you. But it seems I was wrong. - The gentlemen left. - Good. They don't deserve your tears. Leave me alone. Thanks. And you grandma? The doctor was reassuring. She doesn't want to get some rest. - We locked her up in her room. - She may run away. - Is this for her? - She hates the hospital. It's juts "in case". Dad is with her. Let's go swimming. - What do you think of Nasser? - Who? - Hassan's son. - I haven't seen him in 10 years. Don't you know him? A brilliant man. And handsome. He will become someone, God willing. Why does he interest you? - I want him for Paula. - The driver's son? He is stronger than you and me. He has a thesis. Nowadays, a thesis is only worth the parent's wage. - Since you left, Malak got crazy. - I know. This is over, Abbas. - I will leave you. - I forbid it. I can hold on until autumn. I want to see the sea as calm as a lake. And be here for Paula's wedding. Easy with your love words! Love is an emotion, not a word. And how am I supposed to see you emotion? How do you see mine? It can be seen in our eyes. It's not enough. Look thoroughly. Can you see it? Be careful. Don't go too fast. Be careful! The shore! May God protect us! What a show! It's a shame! Love is beautiful. Everybody does what he wants to. Wake up. Right on time. Nasser thinks I only want his money. And that I don't love him. When you grow up and earn a living, you will be his equal. End of competition. So he can love me despite my fortune. He said I have to be your equal first. How much to I owe you. I only brought 7?. It will be free, this time? Next time, be sure you are chief editor. And bring some money. That's it. I have no more reason to stay here. What about me? Aren't I a reason? All of your looks remind me that I'm a failure. You saw Ezz and his dog... My whole life was in this screenplay! So what? We can still do it. You know what? I will produce it myself. You are generous, Malak. I admire you. - But... - But what? I'm an unknown and we barely know each other. Don't be downcast by what is happening. Your happiness is mine. Since the very first day, we have been carried away by... a whirlwind of emotions. I'm sorry. I can't accept your sacrifice. It's over. Let's forget what has been said. I'm begging you... Helping you would make me happy. - You know that. - I know nothing. You are the most precious thing to me. You are my raison d'?tre. Why would you risk millions? This is not a game. I don't care. Money is not a problem. I can't resolve to beg money to the one I love. - I didn't know you loved me that much. - No... Deep inside, you knew. You are an artist... that is difficult to understand. Come. Let's drink to the success of our artistic collaboration! It must be a success since you will be the lead role. - And you? - Me? I will be a guest star. I will do everything I can do make you happy. Tell me to jump out of the window, I swear I will. May I die a thousand times rather than see you suffer. You are crazy! - Where are you going? - To Cairo, with you. Paula thought you would propose her. Paula id dreaming. I told her: our dream is only possible if we succeed without our parents' money. We're far from it. Your father is generous and loyal. You are like him. This is nice of you. You cannot leave these women in these men's hands. This Lamey... He looks like a clever and honest man. Clever, for sure. Honest, I don't think so. So why are you leaving? I must plead a cause tomorrow and save a man's life. I have work too. I will tell my father. No. You and your father stay here and look after the girls. Hello kids. I didn't wait for you. I was hungry. How is the sea today? Is it really important? Nasser spends the weekend with us. Perfect. He is home here. I just had a great idea! You're gonna love it! Did you go swimming? The sea is great! Repeat after me. We should go back to Agami. May the Devil get her. And her gigolo too! Are you abandoning Malak? She is insane and despise my work. I can support her. Take this! I can't be humiliated anymore! - We are like sheep! - No use shouting at us. Even her mother wants to disinherit her. She told it to Abbas. They can't do that. Abbas is Paula's father and Malak doesn't care about money. I've been writing screenplays for 24 years... And I can't find an idea to get rid of this crook. I know! Let the music play! A great idea! If her grand-mother gives everything to Paula. Guess what he will say! What? I swear on my mother's head! As soon as he will know he will change his mind. If the money goes to Paula, Lamey will chase Paula! Not bad! My mother gave birth to a jinn! I'm going to Agami! I'll take a subway if I have to! This subway is stage set! Here is your car! I'm amazed by my own genius! Did you forget? Malak will sing tonight at the Marina! I'm coming with you. But don't drive too fast! At my debut I was discovered by the scenarist Nour El Alfi... And director Ez Eddine. Tonight, I'll present you my own discovering. A new voice. I'll let you judge... If it was a good pick. Here comes, for the very first time... Mr. Jean-Jacques Lamey? - She's gone crazy. - The you have a remedy? Please come on stage. The lyrics are from the poet Kawthar Mustapha. The music is by the very famous Omar Khairat. Here is... "I call". The score from the movie! She is stealing it for that moron! Temporary insanity. Insanity, yes. Temporary, we will see... Will you let us hear it? God forbid... - Look at that. - What a crook... Mrs. Malak! Your mother... You go, I will manage. Excuse me, I can't... Let's hope this is not too serious, and that Malak will be back soon with her beautiful smile. Mrs. Malak's talent is unique. Still, I will try to replace her for a moment. Don't worry... I'm fine. Malak... You can't expect your life to give you everything you want. Your life is dedicated to singing. Never abandon, no matter what happens. Come closer, come closer. Abdel Wahad had a song... I never forgot it. Sing it for us, darling. "The parting night". Sing. The parting night A never-ending night And all our hearts Filled with questions I answered the lover Were going to leave us This flower holds your smell I will keep it As a pledge of our love Your hands picked it Your hands made it even prettier When we had to part You gave it to me My tears ran out But if I had to speak All I could say Is that the lovers left us All together! It's very noisy. I can't hear you. What? Thank you, Sir. So? How is Malak's mother? It's over. You will have to be strong. In a second, happiness becomes bitterness. Malak is a star. She has high standards of living. She will inherit form her mother. Maybe Abbas won't agree with that. He was designed to be the tutor. And he doesn't really like you. But he adores you. You were the boss, so far. A screenplay that wasn't written by you would end up in the trash-bin. But now, Malak only listens to me. True. But her mother disinherited her because of you. - Paula will get everything. - Everything? Paula? How unfair! What can I do? Talk to Abbas. Paula is his daughter. If Malak got married to someone... Let's say a weird doctor. Think about it, psychologist. Who would he give his money to? His daughter or a stranger? Still awaken? Aren't you sleepy? You're thinking about Nasser... We are abandoned. Lamey left one week ago He went to Mansoura. To meet an old patient. And we are alone is this vast void. What would have Grandma done? She would have packed up and taken a plane to Honolulu. I came as soon as I got your message. Is anything wrong? Nasser? Will you get mad if I ask you something... Ticklish? You can always ask. Is Mom in love with you? It seems so. And you? Is there a problem between you? Nothing serious. I admire those who dedicate themselves to something. Like Nasser for politics, Your mother for music. But... It's difficult to share there life, have a meaningful role. I wish I were like them. Ready to abandon family and friends any time. Applauses are like a drug. They dedicated their lives to their work. But what is our place in this? Should we be satisfied with crumbles? Look, your father left. Nasser, he loves you, it's true. He is a great guy. But if your love obstruct his career, he will blame you to change is personality... and corrupt him. "Your money stole my future, I should have been a leader!" This will last your whole life. But all you were looking for was warmth and tenderness. I admire you capacity to reading in people's mind. I will produce him. Lamey and I will create our company. We're just waiting for some papers. If you have a screenplay we will be happy to read it. If it is about my relationship with Lamey, let me tell you the ending... We get married. Don't think I'm pretentious. Lamey is in love with me. Worse and worse... We try to drive him away from your mother and you bring him back to you. - He's a pro. - Don't get me wrong. I love Nasser and will marry him. But Lamey is in love. And I will tell everything to Mom. Wait! Malak is loyal, and fragile. She will only believe us if she hears him say it. Set up a rendez-vous with him. Come here. This flower... Contains a microphone. - It will record everything. - How shameful! Listen, kid. He's in love? Good. Flatter his vanity, he will say it out loud. When he speaks, record him. It's rotating... Are you recording? Yes... No... I need it not to get lost in the scenario. You are remorseless! I could poison you all just for Malak's sake! Your mother fell in a vampire's hands! If we don't help her, who will? Kofi Anan? Do you like art? I'm writing for a magazine that will soon be published. Since I met you an idea obsesses me. Can we live with crumbles of their lives? Only if we live in their shadow. Lamey, be courageous. We are friends, aren't we? I always dreamt of a face... A voice, that would appease me and warm me up. That face was yours. Is was your voice. It's my Mother you love. You are the youth. The youth I didn't had. The serenity I never found. Paula... I love your name. I love to say it. What is going on? I'm surprised. I'm a bit afraid. I need to think. Trust me. Don't you want to marry Mom? This must be a transfer phenomenon. You look alike so much... I was charmed by her voice. But when I dream... I dream of you. I dream of your beautiful body. Everything in you is poetry. Even your gestures... They are magic. The way you eat your shrimps... You fingers, caressing their flesh... Poetry... Music... I have something to tell you. Tell me. - Your eyes... - Go on. When you look at me... I shiver. You are reading in my mind. Your body... When you were lifting the barbells... Your body... You wanted it. Your hair... - No, I'm ashamed. - Desire is natural. There is nothing to be ashamed of. "Even your gestures... They are magic." "The way you eat your shrimps..." Shrimps? You son of a shrimp! Seducing mother and daughter with shrimps! He want to eat them all. What is "atrabilious"? If you write for the people, make it simple. You can say... "dark". You think the reader is a donkey? I don't say that. But you must go straight to the point. The reader will be judge. Write like you think. Would you censure me? You think I'm the government? The power is always with the money. It can fix a man's price. Write it yourself if you are an expert of mass psychology. I'm bored of your fights! I suggest we calm down and eat. May God help me. Forget it. The rice is burnt, the sauce expired and there is no salt. Let's not disturb our leader's genius! Don't worry, my daughter. Stay here. Uncle Hassan is the king of garlic beans. There's no more garlic. And I can't ruin the future or corrupt such a great man! - Did I say so? - Someone did. If my money is such a nuisance, I'd better disappear from your life. And on top of that, I can't cook! Neither sew up your socks! - Did I say something? - No, it was the Pope! I've been dreaming of wearing Mom's veil. I was sure her dress was here. Mom, it's because I love you very much that I need to tell you something. I met a man that loves me more than Nasser. A man that is upset by every single gesture I make. You forgot Nasser quickly. This man even admire the way I eat shrimps. "Poetry... Music..." Where did you hear that? It was Lamey. You met him? He called me yesterday so that "I could know him better". Yesterday? So he wasn't on a trip. He was as troubled as a kid because we are alike very much. The troubled child looking for freedom... I know there words by heart... How far did he go? He is in love with your voice. But at night, he dreams of me. Especially since Alfi told him I was going to inherit. Mom, do you love him? Pardon me, Paula, but I must ask you the same thing. Nasser was all my life. Why... Why do you say "was"? Since we broke up... I see him everywhere. I can't forget him. Why forget him? Did he lie to you? Did he try to use you too? - I ruined his future. - Did Nasser say so? - Not him... - Lamey. His future? You are his future. No man can succeed without a woman at his side. Which one of you left? I did... I slammed the door. And I turned off my cellphone. We are two idiots. Give me Nasser's phone number. - He doesn't have one. - Where can I contact him? Try 590 76 67. You played it nice with Lamey. Wanna see how I play? Hello? Can I speak to Nasser? I am an expert in lies. I especially lie to myself. Nasser, this is Paula's Mother! How dare you ditch her? She is in danger and the super militant run away? Lamey heard she was going to inherit and he asked his hand to Abbas. Abbas is coming here to accept. Hello? Hello? Hello? Do you think he will react? If he doesn't, he doesn't deserve you. They are both crazy. You are wonderful. What are you up to? I took a bath and changed clothes. I like to receive my guests properly. You're writing? Every word you utter. I see you forgave us. There was nothing to forgive. You were right. Let me tell you, you are awesome. My genius is thanking you. - I never said that! - But you will! You know, Malak... Only you can write the end of this story. But you will have to confront Lamey. Lamey is a crook. Where is he? Is Lamey a crook or is Nasser crazy? Nasser is way better! So why look down on him? He's rejecting both Paula and your money. This boy needs to be trained! Me... What kind of father are you? You'd deserve a good beating! You play with women's feelings! And you abandon them to chase another girl! Hail to the tribune! You defend the oppressed? This money doesn't belong to you! And God knows how you get it! Money again! I'll build a hospital for you! Ridiculous! A union... A villa on the Nile for screenwriters... - Give it to the university! - Why not the writers? Shut up! I am not money! And Paula is not money! We are human beings. We are looking for happiness. He is Paula's happiness. If you want to fight, please go out on the street. May I call the matchmaker? No! Let me play my role! We will meet again. Bullshit! - We don't beg for anything. - We'll live under a bridge. Bullshit! Is it the Sheik? I will send you a car. Elmaraghy. No, not a divorce. It's a marriage. This is how it ends? Wait for the epilogue. I won't miss my main scene... The song! You won't believe it. You listen and decide if I deserve the main role. - Hello? - Lamey, my love! I am surrounded by hypocrites. And egoists. They all abandoned me... How can I tell you... How can I tell you... How can I tell you... Tell you I decided to... stop my career! Stop my career and run away with you. I'll wait for you... I will wait for you at the hotel El Hussein. And we will get married. We will live with my little savings. In a hut if we have to. You can be a doctor again. You will be a great doctor. But if you don't come... I'll commit suicide. I'll commit suicide! Cut! Best shot of your career! Shall I do it again? The hut thing maybe was too much. Poetry... Music... - What is he gonna do? - Call you. Where is Mom? She didn't tell. She just left. Where I am? Home, alone... There are only the servants. I will wait for you. In the name of our love. Come quick, please. - I can't do it. - I have an idea, come. Taxi! Taxi! Garden City, quick! Quick, please! I'm going to finish this screenplay! - What do we do? - As soon as he arrives, we disappear. Peace upon this house! Come here, holy man. - Is Miss here? - Come in, I will call her. Lamey! I couldn't wait to see you. I knew you would come. You are always on time. Punctuality is a King's courtesy. I'm crazy about you. But if you don't believe me, I will commit suicide! Let's eat shrimps. Too late, I caressed them all. So you will be... My first failure. And certainly my last one. Finally you have your screenplay. Congratulations. Do you need a title? Story of Malak and Lamey. - Abdou! - Madam? This gentlemen acts better than Clark Gable. - Gable is a dwarf compared to him. - Only you know. Please walk him out. And say farewell. We won't see him again. So be it. Tomorrow is another day. Don't stay here! The Sheik is waiting! Hurry up. - What's going on? - Nasser is marrying Paula. - I disagree. - Bullshit. You go now. May God bless this union. Congratulations. - Is your screenplay done. - Not exactly. You must go back to your public. You owe him everything. It always gave you love with generosity. Read this and come with me. Sing for them. Even before me eyes Knew what your face looks like Even before they knew where you were I love you Since the beginning of the times Even before the universes was created Even before universe had a meaning I love you Until the end of passion You, my love I love you You are my beloved The sun may stop shinning He may die and disappear The moon may abandon the sky The Nile may leave its watercourse But forgetting my love for you This will never happen I will always remember it Forgetting my love for you This will never happen I will always remember it Until the end of passion Until the end of madness I love you And I will always love you Subtitles: tadanobu@KG
