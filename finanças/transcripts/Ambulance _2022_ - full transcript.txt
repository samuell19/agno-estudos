Yeah, great. Uh, look, man. You can definitely, uh, tell me to go eff off, but, uh, I could use some help. Yeah, when you need something, you call me, huh? Okay, yes, I'm here because I need help. I know there was shit between you and LT. I know you and Dad had shit. I had shit with Dad. None of that changed anything between you and me. At least, I didn't think so. I love you, bro. Okay? And I miss you, but let's not... Let's just... let's just call it what it is, man. I left because that life wasn't good for me. How is that right? You put your life down on the line for this country. You leave your family, your home, you miss your kid being born, and what did they give you in return? It gave me purpose. I knew what I was getting into. It's good. Yeah. Is that Dad's watch? Yeah. I found it when I was cleaning out his house. You didn't show, so I just... I took it. Yo, check this out. Look what I found. Look at this. Dad's booties. Look at these pictures. - You and me. - Hmm. Look at you. And who's that? Wait. Wh-What class is that? Um... Ah, Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns. Yeah, right after you stood up, embarrassed me and told the whole class that your family took me in. I owe your family a lot. - It's our family. - Yeah. Maybe one day, you'll let me see my nephew, yeah? How much do you need? - 231. - Mm-hmm. Experimental surgery. Except insurance doesn't cover experimental because, they tell me, it's experimental. How about more? Is this the guy? - No, it's not the guy, Mel. - That's not my name. Yes, it is. It's Mel Gibson. That's your name. - It's not my name. - Well, it should be. - No, I'm not the guy. - You look like Mel Gibson, like from that movie Braveheart. It's, like, one of my favorite movies. Yeah, I get... I get the reference, man. It's a great movie. It won, like, a lot of Grammy... Doesn't he look like that... that guy? Don't you have somewhere to go? Yeah, we all do. So who's this new dude he's got, man? I don't like rolling with new dudes. Hey, guys. Let's go. Get those boxes outside. What the fuck are you doing? Danny, you told me you were done. I was then, but this is now. First Federal Downtown, 32 million. I have this wired. What? No banks hold $32 million. I know. It's a one-off. A fuckup 'cause the feds are vacuuming up paper. But I need another man. Four inside and one driver. Feds are moving it out tonight after hours. We get in there now, it's ours. - No. Jesus, Danny. - It's ours. Hey. This is extraordinary. Let's go. Five minutes. Yo! That is an ugly beast. Ugh. It's a ground-up build. Swapped out the engine for a six Cummins 550. - Should roll nicely. - Nice. You want to make some deliveries while you're out, no one's gonna stop you. Hey. Please thank Papi for me, yeah? - He knows. Be safe, huh? - All right. All right. Hey, Will. Come check this out. Danny, why aren't we taking our car? The Mercedes is faster. Come on. Because this can be tracked and this is clean. All right? Plus, we'll look like clowns coming out of that car. Do you even know how to get to the fucking bank? No. So it's my city, my rules, my job. Just listen to that, all right? - Who is this guy? - What? That's my brother Will. Doesn't look like your brother. Oh, wow. That is original. Yeah. It's original. I'm just saying. Hey, where are you going? Hey, Will. What's up? - What's going on? - I came to you for a loan. Maybe... maybe a small job, at the least. - Not this. - Look. All right, look, I don't have it. Everything I have is tied up in this score. All right? And it's tight. Look, I-I can't... I-I-I need your help. I can't do this alone. I need you. I can't do this with Mel Gibson. I can't do it. No. "Is this the guy?" I'm not stupid. Neither am I. Dad was a fucking psycho. I know that. You know that. Even the FBI knows that. But I'm not him. Look, have I ever gotten you into anything that I couldn't get you out of? Anything? No. - Yes. - The guns are for... Hey, hey, the guns are for... Come on, what-what do you... What do you want me to say? What-what are we gonna do? We're gonna... "Oh, please, can we please have some..." What, are we gonna fake it? No, dude, we have real guns. It's just for protection. You know how it works. We're not cowboys. We're not shooting anything up. This is my job. Come on. We can do this in our sleep. Danny, let's roll. All right! One second! Fuck! Bang-up crew that you dragged me into, Danny. See, that's what I like about you, though. That's what I... - I like the shit you give me. - It's a bang-up crew - you dragged me into, Danny. - I like the shit. Everyone's gonna love Uncle Danny. I mean, I'm gonna be over back for turkey, Christmas. Your second-born is gonna be named after me. I mean, Danny works for both sexes. - This is not funny. - It works for both sexes. It's not funny, Danny. Look, we've got five minutes, and I need to know whether you're in or you're out. You're my brother. I love you. I will do anything for you, and all I'm asking is for you to do this one little thing for me. And now you're here on my doorstep asking me for help, and what am I giving you? I am giving you the world! Listen. It's time for you to do something for yourself. For your family. For your family. Whoa. God, I'm broke. Here you go. Your latte. Really? Drinking a beer on the job? So you were a little traumatized after all. - Zero alcohol, dude. - Oh. Heard from dispatch. Little girl from earlier, Lindsey, she's gonna make it. - I, uh, figured you'd want to know. - No. - No? - No, Scott. - I don't want to know. - What? No, I saw the way you-you handled the whole situation. And you were just so calm and cool. I was freaking out. That's why I want to do this job, you know? Scott, Scott, I'm gonna give you some advice 'cause you're new and you talk too much. Yeah, I-I do. It's just a job. Nothing else. You pick 'em up, drop 'em, forget it. The worst day of their lives is just your Tuesday afternoon. Ah. I see what they say about you is true. That's a bummer. What, you're just gonna drop that? Oh, you want me to take the bait. Okay. Give it to me. You're the best paramedic in town, you can keep anyone alive for 20 minutes... 20 minutes. Mm-hmm. ...and no one wants to be your partner. I already did my research. Well, there's definitely something wrong with me, Scott. Okay, maybe I'm just trying to get to know you. You think about that? So we don't have to sit in that car and be awkward the whole time. Like what kind of music I'm into. I feel like I may have said something too much, so I'm just gonna rewind, retract a little bit here, okay? We could maybe take a picture at the end of the day. Uh... Scott, just eat your sushi. Okay. Um, I'm from Thousand Oaks, but I was raised in Tarzana. - My dad... - Wow. Tarzana. Wait, hold up. So you don't know her name? I do know her name. Her name's Kim. - Kim? - Yeah. Okay, so did you ask Kim out? No. But I'm seeing her across the bank, right? And there's energy flying. And it's electric. And I'm just kind of waiting for that right moment. Zach, we've been to the same bank three times this week. I thought you were just shitty with money. Keep getting the wrong teller. - The wrong teller? - So, yeah. What are you doing? We're going back. Romantics, they don't get the girl... at all. You remember when Sean Connery said, "Losers whine, winners get to fuck the prom queen"? - Hmm? - That was super aggressive. No, I don't remember that. The Rock? The Rock? Yeah, he's an actor. He was a wrestler first. Fucking L.A. drivers. Drive like a bunch of mamalukes. By the way, who wears Birkenstocks to-to a bank robbery, Trent? I do. We're set, guys. You okay? I'm okay. He don't fucking look okay to me, Danny. I'm not sure soldier boy here would hack it back in Brooklyn. - How bad you want to find out? - All right, all right. He's seen more action than all of you, all right? Let's get ready. We're gonna rock this today. Let's get ready to roll, boys. Pull your balls out. We're going to war, baby. We're here. Let's go, let's go. Out of the car, boot. I got an idea. We go in together like Bad Boys. Out of the car. No Benz. I'm not sure if they switched rides. What's this guy doing? It might get stupid here real quick. - What do you got? - So I got this guy in a delivery truck wearing sunglasses down in the parking garage. So this might be going down now. Are your boys ready? Come on, buddy. You wait, Nitro. You hear me? You wait. Yeah? Amigos, no Mercedes. Well, shit. I thought we had a tracker on the Mercedes. What happened to that? - It hasn't moved yet. - Goddamn it. They could be inside the bank, boss. You want us to hit 'em now? No, that'll be a bloodbath. You drop 'em later. Okay? You hear me? And you wait till we get to the dog park. Ugh, buddy. What's going on? The building's locked. Why is it locked? I don't know why it's locked, but it's locked. Hold on. Manager's coming up. "Hey, Kim. Howdy." What can I do you for, Officer? Uh, why are you closed? Oh, we're just doing a transfer in the back. It's procedure. - Okay. - You worried me for a second. - I saw you talking to yourself in the mirror. - Oh. Yeah, you know, I was thinking about starting a savings account. Oh, nice. We've got some great junior accounts. - I'll let you in in 20 minutes. - Yeah? You know what, though, 'cause, um... if I could just get it done real quick, 'cause I'm on the clock. Uh, promise not to rob the place. - What do you think? - Promise? - I won't rob it. - Seriously. 'Cause that would be bad for my job, you know. - I promise. - All right, okay. All right. - All right, come on in. Okay. - Okay. All right. Thought I'd give you a try. I saw your commercials. - Really emotional. - Oh, thank you, thank you. Yeah, the one with the airplane and the dog. - I mean, gets me every time. - Yeah, that was really cute. Well, I'm sure Big Bob can help you over here. Uh, I can help you right over here. - Oh, that's-that's okay. - Yes, sir. Can the woman next to him help me out? Over there. Uh, I think her name is Kim. Kim? Could you just tell me her last name? I just want to be thorough. Uh... - Last name. Her-her name. - Sorry, what? Her full name. - Kim? - Uh, yeah. Just, Kim who? Park. Park. Okay, swell. Okay, Kim's fantastic. Kim, you have a visitor. Make it quick. Hi. Hello. Um... This is gonna sound a little crazy, uh... - What is it? - Well, I-I've... I've been in here in the bank a few times... Wow, it's really just me in here. Um, uh, I-I was personally gonna... gonna try and play it a little cooler, but my... my-my partner in there, you see... He's right out there in this... in the car. He just wanted me to come in and... say something to you, 'cause I told myself that if I ever got the chance to, that I would ask you out... on a date. Like, right now? Doesn't have to be. Could... It-it could be another time. Maybe this weekend or something. Um, but obviously, it doesn't seem like a great time... right now, so I, uh... Hey, are you okay? Fucked up the name, didn't I? No. Uh-uh-uh-uh. I wouldn't do that if I were you. No, no, no, no, no. These are the decisions that matter in life, so let me give you all the information before you decide. Okay, I have two guns, fully auto. One's aimed at you, and the other one's at Kim, your girlfriend. I have you, the tellers, and nine employees in the back, and your partner outside, and it's up to you to make sure that they are all safe. Yeah, kind of a heavy burden. I need you to nod if you understand, Officer. Now, take your fucking hand off the weapon. Give me a big smile and wave at your partner. There you go. Yeah, there you go. - Yeah. All right. - Fuck. Let's go, D. Let's go. $32 million, guys. It's all yours. Please take it. We don't want any problems. I'm out of here. - Hey. - Hello, sir. Yes, sir. Million per block, man.

Memorial. - Will, you got it? - I got it, I got it, I got it. Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Who let you in here? Who let you in? Whoa, whoa, whoa! I got an officer down! - Check the back. - I've got an officer down. - We're going to Memorial. - Let me see your hands. Wade, check inside. Who let you in here? Let me see your hands. Keep 'em up. Don't move. Chris, Chris, hold it. Hey, I'm just a... I'm just a driver. I've got an officer down. Ready? Go. Who is it? Who is it? I got a... I got a cop shot. We got to go. Move your cars. We got to get him to the hospital. Move! It's a cop! Let me do my job! What are you doing? - Go! - All right. Fine. He's a cop. Let's get him out of here. All right, let's go. Get him out of here. - Go! Go, go, go! - All right, let's go! Let's go! Let's go, people! Make a hole. Get 'em out. All right, move! Get out of the way! Out of the way! There we go. See? That wasn't so hard. Give me your phone. G-Give me your phone. Yeah, yeah. Lights. I need lights. Lights. Center console. The red button. - Which one? Which one? - The red button. Right there. Hey, Will. We got through it. Not as tight as I wanted, but we got through it. $16 million. $16 million. Say, Cam, how does your company track this thing? Satellite. Found it. I'm gonna work on him now. Is that okay with you? Yeah, yeah. Work on saving the rookie. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, buddy! What happened? Hey, what happened? Where's the ambulance? What happened? - Huh? - They took the ambulance. - Say "they"? - They took... 1-Adam-25 to Control. Suspects have hijacked a red and white ambulance. The ambulance got my partner. They got my partner. Hey, hey. Hey, hey. Hey, listen. Hey. You tell me exactly what they look like. Backup car's on Flower, Will. Just at the end of the street. - Got it? - Yeah. - Hey, give me your radio. - What? Give me your radio. What are you gonna do with those? Don't worry about that. You're not gonna put those on me, are you? When we're clear, I'm gonna call 911. I'm gonna tell them where you are. Okay? All right? Yeah. Hey. Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to point the gun at you. I don't really like pointing guns at anybody. It's not really my thing, but, like, when you... I mean, what was I supposed to do, you know? I know it's funny, but it's... I'm sort of more of the sensitive one of the two of us. It's... Hey, boss. Jesus. Talk to me. How does something like this go down right in front of LAPD headquarters? So the Brooklyn crew we've been following, they're all dead. Yeah, we think it's an L.A. crew inside the ambulance. Oh, we got a new crew? We don't know. It's looking that way. Talk to me about that ambulance. - Who fucked that up? - We did. - It was a clusterfuck. - You think? But the rookie screwed us up trying to get his future ex-wife's phone number. What's that? What'd you say? You're the one that caused this mess. - Huh? What'd you say? - Hey! - What'd you say? Huh? - All right, all right! - Say it again! - Hey! Calm down before I smash your ass - back to the academy. - Stop. - You're the reason we're in this. - Stop! Mark, right? Can I call you Mark? - Yeah. - That was my call, Mark. You want to blame somebody, you blame me. Now it's my job to get your partner back, okay? - His name's Zach. - All right. Three months out of the academy. Good kid. - He's gonna be all right. - You know that for sure? No, but I know I got the best possible people on it, okay? Air 11 over City Hall, southbound 900. Be advised, suspect fled from a parking garage. Ambulance marked "Unit 3." Injured officer inside. Whoa! What's going on? What the hell? We're screwed. - We got an airship. - What? Airship. Where? Oh, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You sure they see us or not? - Yeah, no, no. Shit. Look. - I'm not sure. They just flew right over us. They didn't see us. Really, really wasn't expecting helicopters today. - You think we should bounce on foot? - No, no. The stash car's too far. We won't make it. - Shit. - Just drive. Drive, Will. Come on. Will, drive. We're a sitting duck, Will. We got to move. We're not gonna do anything. We're just sitting here. I got to get back to my wife and my son, Danny, no matter what. You're going to. You drove generals and politicians in Kabul. You can do this. - This ain't Kabul, man. - I know. It's L. fucking A. Nobody knows this city better than you. Nobody drives better than you. Will, come on. I'm gonna get you back home, little brother. I'm gonna get everybody home. Come on, little brother. Come on. Will. All right. Yeah? Let's go. Hey, what is it? What's going on back there? It's good. I'm just helping him. - Hey, hey! What? - Hey, what the... What? What? Hey! Don't you move! Stop it! Come back here now. Turn around and go. Come on! We do not have time. Come on, Cam. Oh, shit. Hey, wake up. Wake up. Hey, hey. Shit! Hey, help! The heart machine is buzzing! Help! Come on, Cam. Let's go. Fuck you. I don't know what happened. It just started beeping. Shit. He's V-fib. Fuck. Come on, Zach. Oh, God. Come on. One, two, three, four, five. I don't know what happened. - It just started beeping. - He's about to die. It's cashmere! Drive. Save that cop's life! Okay, we got to stay in the alleys. What? No. Just-just take Spring. You want to drive, or can I drive? Just drive fast. - We're doing hostages now? - What? - Hostages. - The ones in the back? Yes, we are, Will. Is there a problem with that? L.A. Sheriff's 172, 1.7 southbound along the 101. Uh, coming up to Scientology. He'll be Downtown... We're now approaching the Bonaventure Hotel. Hey, Cap. Air support just spotted the ambulance six blocks east. Lock everything down. Nothing gets out. I want mobile command moving in five. - Let's go, boys. - Hey, Cap. What about your dog? Yeah, you take Nitro home. Treat him like he's your own, okay? - Yes, sir. - Good boy. Oh, Cap, what's that smell? Oh, we had Mongolian barbecue last night. Good boy. Good boy. All right. I'll treat you good. Okay, keep pushing, keep pushing, keep pushing. Oh, God. Two... It's clear I'm not a priority. That's not true. I mean, it would be great if we could talk about something - other than bad guys... - Mmm. ...and bank robbers and murderers. I'm not quite sure what else I'm supposed to talk about when I get home. Something other than bad people, maybe. Maybe me. You could ask me how I'm doing. He got a promotion. Yeah, yeah. He's a big FBI agent now. Finally, I have a chance to run my own unit. What kind of unit? Special agent in charge of L.A. Bank Division. People still rob banks? Kyle, do we have to pay for the dumb questions, or-or are these ones free of charge? You're so rude. Can you put that away, please? I got to go, boo. Hey, boss. Chief Moore just gave us full tactical control. Of course he did. No one else wants this shit show. Hey, the mobile CP just arrived. I got to go. My ride's finally here. Mobile MCU on site. Damn, you're young. You're old. Let's hope you keep up. I like her. Talk to me. You better know the city. - Like the back of my hand. - Tell me, then. We have mutual aid with Sheriff's, the CHP. Suspects' vehicle's heading south on Flower. Ambulance is a Type III, 15,000 pounds of reinforced metal on a V-8 monster. It looks brand-new, and the guy driving is possibly Lewis Hamilton. Who's that? Basketball player or something? Best F1 racer. F1... that's for fancy people. I'm a dog guy. Oh, that's nice. Dhazghig. It's pronounced "Zaga." And, due respect, sir, we don't have time to flirt. Rush hour's in 45 minutes, and Dad's making gomgush tonight. Okay. Dhazghig. Don't let 'em out of your sight. Copy. CP-One to Control. Have additional air units respond to our location. Air 11 en route from the heliport. One minute ETA. Commander Four King to Control. I want Major Crimes' cyber unit to use Triggerfish to find whatever communication devices they have on board. Get 'em fast. Over. Target is proceeding down Broadway. Have all units respond southbound on Broadway. Southbound 101 at Vermont 1000. I run a different game than most, and you're gonna help me execute. S.I.S. deals with the smartest and the most dangerous criminals. I need to know who I'm dealing with, everything about them. I'm requesting units to set up a perimeter. Strategy. Kind of like a mix between a chess match and a cage fight. Great analogy. Put a little pressure on, then I pull back. Then I push harder, get 'em off balance. In two hours, they're either dead or in cuffs. Uh, not the fluffy ones, though. The real hard metal. You know, the cold metal on the skin. All right. We're on the clock, Dhazghig. Okay, this is Captain Monroe. Listen up. We're not throwing down spike strips. We're not crashing into this ambulance. We got a brother cop on board. Cam, we're almost out of your hair. You just keep pumping. But I'm gonna call 911 for you, okay? - And sorry about that gun thing, really. - Yeah, all good. Just call 911. You're rich now, boys. No. No, no, no, no, no. No. - Shit. - No. Shit. Where did they come from? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Quiet. I need it quiet. Crossed traffic, due head-on. He's head-on. - Whoa. Easy, easy. - Come on, come on, come on. No, no, no, no, no, no. Two cars! Two cars! There are two cars! They're right... - We got to ditch this. - I'm on it, I'm on it. - We got to ditch this ambulance now. - I'm on it. Find me a street, Danny. - What? - Just find me a street. Air 11, suspects are now southbound. He's coming right at you. Shit. Shit. I can't do this alone. I need more hands than this. Danny! Get your ass back here. He's dying. - I need your help. I need more hands. - What? You need to help me. Go help her. Help the cop. Help the cop! You're gonna have a cop dead any minute now, and you're going to prison for the rest of your fucking life. - What's going on? - I'm about to lose him. Get the defib pads. - The what? - The defibs on the right pocket. Grab them quick. Move, move. Turning into the bus yard underneath the 10 freeway. We're gonna lose sight. Grab them quick. Move, move! Help me with his neck, please. - His neck keeps... - Just let it go. I need the pads urgently, or he's gonna die. - Do I look like an EMT? - Jesus! Daniel! Your yelling doesn't help. Goddamn it, I'm not used to being in a police chase, okay? - Open them. - All right, all right. Just give me a... One, two, three. I need the pads urgently, - or he's gonna die. - I got it. Hold tight. Black pocket, next to the monitor. - Right and left ribs. - One has a little heart. - It has a picture. - And then one has a one on the pad. So, the right chest, left rib. Right there and there. M-My right or your right? His right, you fucking moron. Hang tight. Shit. Jesus! Charge it to 300. Yellow button. Yellow button. "Alarms." - It says "charge," and then it says... - Yeah, that button. - The yellow one. - Then there's, like, a squiggly... Yeah, I know. I just-just... Danny, the only fucking button that says "charge"! It looks like a fucking Atari game! I don't fucking know! - Just... Charge? Charge? What? - Clear. Stay clear. - Move, move, move! - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure. Go. Clear. Whoa! Shit. Whoa. We need to take him to the hospital now! Yeah, well, I wish I didn't have herpes, but, you know, we all got to go with what we got. Oh, man. You are lucky you just get to drive. We just zapped him. We did that shock shit. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Dead end. Dead end. Can you get just a little closer? 'Cause I can't read the sign. My bad, my bad, my bad. You're not listening to my directions. Units responding, it's a dead-end street. Slow down. Yep, that's on me. I fucked that up. Yeah, yeah. Beast. He's knocking my cars around like tenpins. Yeah, it's a very expensive car chase right now. That cop helo's got us. We should've parked the stash car under the bridge, man. Well, sorry I didn't think of that. We need cover. Enough time to ditch and run. Shit. In Afghanistan, we'd have Preds track terrorists under bridges and they'd Texas-switch on us. Texas switch is like when a terrorist drives under a bridge with one car and they pop out with five identical cars. I mean, it's crazy, but it worked. Whoa, it's only six blocks away. Cam. In the ambulance yard, do they keep the keys in the gas cap or in the visor? In the cap. Why? Papi. Roberto. - Danny Sharp. - Thank you, son. Burner? Qué drama. Danny boy. You're interrupting a very exciting police chase. They're chasing some ambulance. Yeah, I am the ambulance. Wow. It's a bit tense in here right now. Jesus, vato. Never a dull moment with you. Why are you calling me? Look, I need help. I need a diversion. I'm kind of in a dealmaking mood. All right. Start boxing them in You should've thought of that before, Danny. You're on your own now. Look, I got 16 million in here right now. You throw me a lifeline, I'll give you half. Come on, Papi. Do it for my dad. You're family. I know about the Zetas, Papi. I know about the money you owe them. You save my ass, you can buy 'em out tonight. What's the plan? Look, it's simple. I just need your guys to pick up some trucks Downtown. We got a deal? We just steal them from the yard, yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah, man, we'll pick 'em up. Don't worry. I'll get Roberto right now. Goddamn. Saddle up. We're on the move. What's up? It's insane, and it's our ticket. Make your moves. All you got to do is go that way. Pass it, though. Oh, my God. G-Go! That's what they pay you for. - Hello? - Hey, Castro. Boss man, what's up, man? Your flamingos just got here. What you want me to do with them? They came to the office? No, they're supposed to be at the Turks and Caicos property. She turns six tomorrow. I'm gonna get in so much trouble, man. We have the elephants. We have the bouncy castle. Tommy the Clown is already there. We've gone over this so many times. Danny, slow the... First of all, slow down. - Castro... - My blood pressure high. Are you... you good? What's up? What? I'm fine! Yes, I need your sprayer, blue paint, and you... and meet me at that pin that I just sent you. And I'm going to give you $10,000 when you get there. - You hear me? Blue paint. - Got you. But I'm watching the game right now, and I got money on it, so what's going on? What, soccer? What? I... It's football, and it's actually the most sophisticated and the biggest game in the world, but continue. I don't care about your dumb sport - or your dumb ball! - Okay, I got you. Blue paint, sprayer, flamingos. No! Not the flamingos! Listen! No. The blue paint comes with the spray gun. Just leave the flamingos alone! They are two separate events! Get out of the way. Get out of the way! I'm running low on fluids. He could use some blood. What's the problem now? I'm O negative, universal. Oh, my God. You can donate blood. Come here. Come here. Help me. I will run an IV to your arm, and I can just connect you to him. It's almost rush hour. We got to wrap this up, or a lot of innocent people are gonna be in danger. Bank surveillance was corrupted. They got into the computer. Oh, they're good. FBI database facial rec has him as Danny Sharp. Holy shit. Tell LAPD we want in now. Air 64 confirmed off Flower to Figueroa, approaching Convention Center Drive. Dhazghig, give me a code 100. Stagger the units ahead. Setting all lights to green for eastbound Olympic. So far, RHD cyber found a sat phone and police scanners on board. So they're hearing us. Well, we'll use that. Hey, what's up? What's happening? They're gonna try to trap 'em. All right, our target's near Staples Center. Let's roll. Let's roll! Hey, that's my car. Swap the cars out. Get our aggressive guys up front. Jesus. Careful. Send a unit to the driver's-side door and irritate him a bit. They don't lay back, we're gonna crash this whole motherfucking thing! Why do you keep switching the cars around? It unnerves them, makes them feel like we're coming from everywhere. Switch so he can hear me. This is Captain Monroe, LAPD Special Investigations. Okay, well, you need to tell them to lay back. Big message for LAPD... you pull your helos up and out, or I hurt people. Who am I speaking with? I don't want to call you Mr. Bank Robber. Come on, buddy. There's a Dodgers game tonight at 7:30. Ooh, I love Dodger Dogs. I want to wrap this up so we can both... You get your helos out of here now! You don't want me hurting this cop. Why don't you listen to me now? You give me my officer and one paramedic, not only will I get rid of the choppers, I'll throw in a Dodger Dog. What do you say? This asshole. We're a locomotive. We don't stop. Look, I'm not trying to trick you. I don't think you're getting the message. We don't stop! Well, neither do we. Protecting our investment, Danny. Getting ready right now. We're bringing one of our special cartel builds. We'll be there, brother. Three minutes! Let's go! - Papi. - Jesus. Roberto's ready to go. Get me a Topo. I got this very nice gift from the Zetas. Very charming. Seems like the police are playing some sort of cat-and-mouse game with these suspects... Let's go watch crazy Danny on TV. Chuck, as you can see in the studio, what's going on right now is there are a lot of cops staggered around a bunch of blocks around the Convention Center. We have a-a massive police presence forming around the Convention Center. It's gonna be a hard one to lock down. 18, you on for 11? You available? A hundred percent. Yes. Come on. We're gonna trap 'em here. Lock this place down. We have no visuals around the corner. Fuck, fuck, fuck! Oh, shit! They're gonna box us in. Just keep it steady, Will. Who the hell is this? I can't shake this guy. Jesus. Careful. Slow down. I'm gonna shoot one. - What are you doing? - Steady. I'm right on you. No! Hey, what... Hey! Stop! Goddamn it! Stop! You hear me? You're gonna hurt someone. I'm going inside. They're going into the Convention Center. Ah, you got to be kidding me. This guy's a hell of a driver. Blockade every exit. Keep leapfrogging the teams. Block 'em in! Come here. I'm gonna teach them a lesson. Hey, let her go! Get back! This boy is certifiable. - Danny, what's going on back there? - Get the fuck back! Drive! Back! Back up! Back up! I'm not backing up! Whoa! Shit! Fuck it! Who the fuck put you back here? Is that my... Is that my... Is that my dog? Who brought my fucking dog on a police chase? And who puts a big-ass dog in a cop car? Pull back, everybody. Pull back. Nitro, down. Get down. Nitro. Nitro, get down, boy. Pull back. Pull back. It's too dangerous. Calm down, Danny. I'm pulling everyone back. I'm gonna give you some room so we can talk. We're not hurting her. Look, I just need them to think that we will. Danny, we are not hurting her, okay? Look, I'm not him. I'm not LT. I don't know how many times I have to tell you that. You shot a cop, an LAPD cop. Okay? They're gonna kill us the first chance that they get. So forget about her. It's all about him. He is the reason that we're alive. Suspects are now southbound on the 110 freeway at a high rate of speed. L.A. 5-0. They can extend the Sigalert for one more hour. This is Sky 4. As you can see, Highway Patrol, uh, out on the forefront stopping, uh, traffic, trying to close, uh, the highway down. Several helos are following these two suspects. And with police cars in pursuit, it just... I don't know how much longer these two suspects can, uh, go on. Uh, got to wonder what's going on through the minds of these... You know that feeling when you're a kid playing hide-and-seek... ...and you're about to get caught? Mm-hmm. I'm real good at making people feel that way. This, uh... just such a crazy day. It just... It reminds me of, uh, years ago the North Hollywood shoot-out. Suspects are southbound on the 110 freeway, approaching Manchester in the ExpressLane. Where's that blood coming from? No. Where's it coming from? Shit. - You shot him twice. - No. - What's going on? - He's bleeding out. Finally. Feds. I'm Captain Monroe. You're wasting my time. Why didn't S.I.S. hit the robbery? Oh, that's old-school S.I.S. That'll get you shoot-outs and kidnappings. Yeah. We hit 'em when they come out. Oh, wonderful. Well, that's working out real well, huh, guys? Are you from L.A., Special Agent Clark, with your suspenders and looking like you're 20? 20? No, Toledo. Oh, great, another tourist. Okay, can we just skip over the whole "I don't know shit and you fought in Vietnam" speech? How old do you think I am, man? Look, I can help you here. This isn't a bank robbery. It's a hostage situation. - Oh, it's far worse than that, sir. - What? The guy who held your paramedic out the back is named Danny Sharp. Danny's been robbing banks since he was 17. His father LT was a legend, bona fide psychotic. Killed six bank managers, two tellers in the '90s. Oh, tremendous. Well, he is causing a shitstorm. - Oh, wonderful, FBI. - Oh, great. We could run a mini war from in here. Plus, RHD can stagger our assets. Wade, tell D-Team to get ready. We're gonna trap this fucker. - Roger that. On it, boss. - Don't. That is a mistake. Why? Danny is a different breed. He could've easily killed your cop back there at the bank, but he didn't. All right? He is looking for a way out. How do you know that? We used to be friends. Let's roll. Get this bitch rolling! We'll be there in a few. You just-just stay there. - We'll be there in a few. - Y-You're just more uptight than you normally are, man. You know, I don't know. Uh, everything is gonna be okay. I got your... I got the spray. I got the flamingos that landed. Counted them by hand, all of that, man. Okay? So everything will be fine. You just got to take a deep breath, 'cause you stressing me out, man. Hey, Toledo. So you're telling me you went to college with Danny Sharp? I was getting my doctorate in criminology at Maryland. Ooh, you're a regular Doogie Howser. Don't know who that is, boomer. So, what, they were bringing criminals in to study? No. He was in the program. He was there to study us. Daddy's idea. Yeah, he lasted about two semesters, took every class he could. Then, one night, after sharing a bottle of rosé, telling each other bad-father stories, poof, he disappears. - Rosé? Ugh. - Yeah, rosé. You got a problem with that? - It's just gross. - I like rosé. In the last ten years, he's robbed 37 banks. No, make that 38. - That's good. - How is that good? 'Cause he'll talk to you. - Prognosis? - He needs an OR. He doesn't need more blood. He needs a doctor that knows what he's doing to open him up, stop the bleeding. I don't know how to do this. All right, so call one. Have him talk you through it. No. Mm-mm. No, no, no. I can't. Wh-Why is the answer no - when it has to be yes? - No, because I'm not... - Know someone in your ER? - I'm not qualified. Yeah, doctors, doctors... All right, Dr. Franken? - Huh? - No. Dr. Williams? That's my shrink. Dr. Waters? What is that picture from? What is that, Cancún? McDreamy. Colin Waters. - Where's he work? - At Mount Sinai. - All right, I'm calling him. - I-I can't do this. Please. - Yes, you can. You're gonna do some doctor shit. - Please. Yes, you can. Yeah, I'm microwaving. Hold on a sec. Loud, yeah? - Colin, it's me. - Hey, Cam. It's been a while. I know. It's been six months. Yeah, listen, uh, this isn't really a good time. - I'm on my way to work. - I need you to walk me through a GSW to the abdomen. What are you talking about? You're not a surgeon. You can't do that. You're an EMT. Yeah, I fucking know that, Colin, but I have a situation. Situation? What situation? I'm a hostage. Oh, shit. That thing in L.A.? You're in the ambulance? - Colin. - Yeah. Who's this? Yeah, I'm the guy who's gonna kill her if you don't help us. Okay, no, no, no, no. All right, don't hurt her. Cam, give me his stats. Tell me what you see. His vitals are dropping fast. He's losing blood. I'm... I'm gonna call some trauma guys. Hang on. What's up, Colin? Farcy! You got to pair my phone to the screen. He needs to see the surgery. Dr. Resnick and Dr. Farcy. We're trauma surgeons. Hey, Cam. What do you got? Surgeons are walking her through an operation to remove the bullet. - Come again? - RHD are on with her, with doctors on with her right now. Do you hear what's going on right now? Cam, what's the vital sign, blood pressure, pulse? It's not good. I'm sending through. Vitals are crashing. We need to start working faster. Hey, Danny! Yeah? - Come and switch with me, man. I've done... - What? I've done this before. I can help. All right, Cam, these are trauma docs. We're all gonna help. What do you got for supplies? Yeah, I got everything but no anesthesia. - Will. - What? Don't forget she's the hostage. All right, show us what you got. You can see the abdominal area is really swollen. I'm thinking there's internal bleeding. He's likely bleeding out from the spleen. Hey. Do you have EMT experience? Combat triage. - I can follow orders. - Good. You're a soldier? Yeah. Gloves. Move. Sir, did you shoot him with an AR or with a handgun? You got to slow down. We're about to do surgery right here. We're a shark. We don't stop. Well, hey, pal. Nice to see you haven't changed. Oh, my God. You got time for an old buddy? Well, I recognize that voice. If you're calling me, you're the head of Bank Division. It's about time. It's always been your destiny. I guess you're wondering why we're slowed down. I'm actually wondering why you would ever put yourself in this situation to begin with, but sure, yeah, let's start there. We're just trying to keep a cop alive back here. - It's a little tense. - Camille can't do this. - She's not a doctor. - Yeah, no shit she's not a doctor. She's actually competent. Listen. - Danny, Danny, Danny... - Uh, I got to go, but, uh, I-I'll drop you a line sometime. - We got to catch up. - Oh, yeah? Well, I got a funny feeling you're about to have a lot of free time on your hands. Mm. Yeah, on a tropical island. I'll send you a postcard. Yeah. Who's the other guy, your driver? Get a pen and paper. Write this on it: Fuck off! Poke a hole in the skin, then take the scissors. I need you to open him up. Open the skin. Here we go. Here we go. I got it. I'm going for the skin. Okay, I'm cutting, cutting skin. Out of the fucking way! Look... We're an ambulance! Skin is open. Then you and your criminal friend right there put both of your hands in the wound, and I need you to spread the muscle apart. Man, the way people drive in this city. - Stop yelling. - Slow down. You cannot do this at 60 miles an hour. Just pull it like a rubber band. - You have four minutes to do this. - Go. Okay, and pull. Pull, pull, pull, pull. I need you to blunt-dissect with your hand. All right? Totally down. - You're doing good. - Slow down, Danny. Danny, I need you to slow down. How about we all just get out and walk? Get... Danny, just give me 20! Now is not the time to argue! This is as slow as I go. - I need you to slow down, man! - Slower. We're playing live Operation back here. Just slow down! This is gonna be the slowest cop chase in the world. - Lots of crazy shit going on back here! - Just shut up! - Just... Okay. - Shit. Tell everyone to calm the fuck down. What are you doing? The aorta. Yeah, I can feel it. I need you to squeeze it now. Squeeze it hard to stop the blood to the spleen. God, I'm trying. You're do... you're doing good. You're doing good. It's working. It's working. Drop down to 20 miles an hour. Give 'em some distance. She's operating on our brother right now. Cam, his blood pressure's dropping. He's about to code. Palpate for the bullet. - You got it. - Okay. It should be a sharp object. Okay. I can't find it. - Oh, God. - What? It's on the spleen. Colin, it's pressed onto the spleen. What do I do? What do I do? - I've never done this before. - Okay, Cam, Cam, Cam, Cam. Calm down. I need you to show me the spleen. I need to visualize it. - Where's he bleeding from? - Hey, look at me. - You're just nervous, okay? That's it. - Okay. - You're just nervous. - Okay. My wife, she gets nervous all the time. You know what we do? We breathe. You're doing good. Okay, I got it, I got it. I think he's waking up. I think he's waking up. Oh, yeah, yeah. He is fully awake. Oh! - Hold him down. I'm in his gut! - Yeah, yeah. I think he knows. - Stop. - He's fully awake! - Oh, my God. This is insane. - That's insane. - Stop him, Will. - Trying to save you. No! Hey, whoa, whoa. Just trying to help out. Stop. Stop. We are trying to save you. Oh, sh... Go to sleep! What are you doing?! I-I let you back there for like five minutes, and now you're punching the cop? That worked. - Is... is he out? - Yeah, he's out, he's out, he's out. All right, all right, listen to me. The spleen has an artery attached to the bottom of it. You need to pull it out slowly. Pull the spleen. Gentle. I don't want it to burst. Cam, you can do it. - Gentle. Don't let him die. - You got it, you got it. It's coming out. Colin, if this spleen ruptures, he's got 60 seconds. I got it. I'm gonna grab it. I got it. Okay. I'm taking it out. I got the bullet. It's coming out. Okay, I've almost got it. I've almost got it. It's out. It's... Oh, God. It burst. It burst, Colin. What do I do? I don't know what to do in this situation. You got to clamp that right now. He's gonna bleed out. I-I used all the fucking clamps! - I don't have anything to clamp it. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Look at me. Look at me. Listen. Listen. Do you know what we do? We breathe. Okay? - That's all. We just breathe, okay? - Okay. I got it. Clamp. I got to clamp it. I got a clamp in my hair. I got a clamp in my hair. Grab it, grab it, grab it, grab it. Okay. You got to clamp underneath. You got to clamp the artery. Fast, fast, fast. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. It worked. Oh, shit. Did it work? It worked. Oh, shit. This shit is crazy. Yeah, we're doing crazy today. Does your wife know you rob banks? Why you asking? Situational awareness. That's all. Let's tape him up. Why they have slowed down to 20 miles an hour... because that heroic EMT in the back of that ambulance, Camille Thompson, is performing surgery on that officer, trying to save his life. - Hey. - How you doing? We're good here. How about you? Yeah, no, we're good. We're good. We're bringing some party favors: C-4, special package, Papi's gift. Hey, yeah, listen to me. We're just trying to get away. We're not trying to start a war. Can't believe what we got for you. Tell Papi I appreciate it, all right? Just protecting our investment, Danny. We roll strong. We're familia. Hey, Will. Your big brother is making moves! So you and that doctor, Colin? Yeah. We met at med school. I made it to my third year of residency. I got addicted to speed. And I blew it. And now I'm here, so... What about Colin? Well, I found a way to screw that up, too. Hey, get out of the way! Mm, mm. Yeah, I know what you mean. Shit. Out of the way! Will, you got to drive! - Get back up here. - Hey. I'm gonna get you out of this. Okay? Yes? I got cut off as the officer's spleen was rupturing. Bottom-line it for me. Is our guy alive? I just told you. It's a tough procedure, even for the best of doctors. She tried her best. Chief's on the line. Chief? Our guy's dead. Yeah. These sons of bitches about to have a really bad day. Hey, Will, I got on the 105, a-and I headed to the airport. - Really? The 105? - I don't know what fucking happened. - How did you get to the 105? - I don't know, man! There's so much shit going on! If we just... Do you know how many cops are at the airport, Danny? Know how to get... How can we get back Downtown? They're on the 105, heading toward the airport. Give me a code 100 for D-Team. Have 'em jump ahead to the 105-405 overpass. Leapfrog the teams if you have to. I got a plan I've been working for about 45 minutes. You need to take me to this bridge. Olympic Bridge... you know it, along the L.A. River. Everybody converge at the 105-405 interchange. - You should wait. - For what? They won't talk. They won't negotiate. What am I supposed to do, FBI boy? All right, for one, cut the "boy" shit. Chief wants this. Mayor wants this. He's a Silver Lake liberal. What's the move? Remember that place we used to boost cars by the L.A. River? I need you to take me there. Olympic Bridge is right next to where we used to ditch and scatter cops. Want to take 'em on a Kobe-to-Shaq alley-oop? We'll shake 'em. All right? We didn't necessarily steal a Jag. I can't do those moves in this thing. You can do anything. You can do anything. You don't need a Jag. Fuck it. Leave 'em in the dust just like the old days. Then I'll get us right by the bridge. I'm gonna take you home. All right, let's go. Fan out! We got to think about this. There's nothing to think about. Nobody gets to kill a cop. We're herding them into a place that's already prepped. D-Team is taking them out simultaneously. They're gonna be dead in three minutes. This might be our last chance. Blockade every exit. Push 'em. The paramedic is still alive. And I want to keep her that way. Coming at us about 65, 70 miles an hour, about a minute out. - What are your odds? - Well, it's not 100%. She's in the back, sir. It'll have to be head shots. Then we've got a ground team that'll come in and sweep it up. Give me your odds. What are the chances, Dyle? 80, 90 percent. No more waiting. Wait broke the wagon. D-Team, that's a green light. You got to negotiate her out. This is a mistake. This is a mistake, Toledo? - Not your buddy killing a cop? - He's not my buddy. Why haven't they tried to stop us? 'Cause our lucky rookie cop is on board. Mobile unit is in position now. Hey, we got to turn around. We got to get back Downtown. Zach's phone. Zach's ph... Hey, give me the... the cop in the ambulance, give me his phone number. Snipers, 45 seconds. - Hello? - Cam? Don't talk. Just listen. This is Agent Clark, FBI. I need you to get down under the stretcher, and do it now. Snipers, 20 seconds. I have eyes on the target. Two-nine, negative. We're still on the freeway. Light brown car. The snipers are gonna take them out. You need to stay as low as possible. What? We still green? We're still green. Green for go. Take-take the shot if you got it. Target one, green. Kill shots. Nothing gets in the back. We've got friendlies. On my call. Target two, red. Target two not clear. Wh-What about Zach? I can't protect him. Can you? What are you talking about? - He's alive? - Yes, he's alive. Hey, he's alive. - Our cop's alive. - God! - Three. - No. - Cam? - No. Two. - Snipers! Snipers! - What? Where? Black building! One. Engage. Oh, shit! Go! Ten-David, stand down. - Stand down. - Fuck! The billboard! He knows what he's doing. Must be a vet. I see what's happening now! Oh, you want to play? Now we just pissed them off. - So, where are they going? - Anywhere he wants. She warned them. All units, fall back. I repeat, fall back. And give me an assessment. Anybody get hurt? All right. You want to play? Let's go. I only want two undercover cars on them, 500 feet. These are smart L.A. boys. Danny's studied FBI. He's studied LAPD pursuit tactics. He knows it's all standard shit But what he doesn't know, super special agent, is I'm S.I.S. We set traps. We let the bad guys come to us. So you text Cam. You make her an asset, you hear me? You find out where they're going. I'll set a trap nobody gets out of. Where's Monroe? We got contact. I'm here. You're supposed to save the hostages, right? You're supposed to keep them alive, right? Or did I get that wrong? I want everyone alive, Danny. So why the fuck are you shooting at us? That was a breach. A what? A mistake. Miscommunication. Bullshit! You don't think I'm gonna hurt anyone, do you? That's not true. I know what you're capable of. Oh, yeah? Did Anson tell you what my father would've done? Why don't you tell me again? He would've killed your cops and the EMT back at the bank, and then he would've had a snack afterwards. Just take it easy, all right, Danny? Everybody knows how dangerous you are. Do you? Hey, you need to keep it cool back there, man. You don't got to prove a thing to me. Danny? Did I lose you, buddy? Take it. - No. - Take it. - Why? - Go on, take it. Come on. Just click it open and make sure they can hear everything. Tell him what I'm doing. He's standing up, and he has a gun in his hand. Danny... I saved you. I saved both of you. Okay? Why does everybody think they are so special? I don't know what's going on nowadays. You're just like the rest of us. You're just not important. Yo, Danny, relax. No, I'm not important, but he is. And I'm keeping him alive. You need me, Danny. Careful, kid. No, we don't need you anymore. Danny, relax! You're full of shit, Danny. Am I? Danny! - Will! - Danny! Will! - Are you crazy right now? - What are you doing? What did she say? Will? Was that a name? What are you doing? They need to know... Motherfucker! William Sharp. He's Danny's brother. You always got a fucking plan. Stop the car! Who's fighting? Can we see? You fucking stop! God! That hurt! Hey! All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right... - Do it again. Do it again! - All right, all right... Easy, easy. Easy. - You're crazy. - Say it! Say it! - Look! I have a plan! - Shut up! Papi's guys are setting a diversion for us at Boyle Heights. She says they're going to Boyle Heights intersection. Boyle Heights intersection. He's gonna try to lose us there. Shit, the FBI. Let go. It's Anson, FBI. Danny, you there? Danny? No, we just got a change in the pitching rotation. Hi, Will. You boys having a little squabble in there, huh? What's your plan here, man? Guess you're in charge now, little brother. Bad guys can't hear me. Our fixed-wing has high-altitude eyes. Make it look like we disappeared. Air 11 to every team. We're pulling off. You know, it seems to me like we're the only ones trying to keep these people alive, Special Agent. Oh, yeah? How you figure? Just give us some space. I thought you were supposed to be the smart one, no? Yeah, apparently not. I've seen your file. I mean, you joined the Marines so you wouldn't have to end up like dipshit brother Danny or your psycho dad LT, right? I mean, you're a fucking war hero, man. What are you doing? That was yesterday. We're talking about today. You take a hostage, it's 30 years. Just shut the fuck up, Danny. What are you, his fucking lawyer? I'm giving him great legal advice. Will, listen to me. You got a family. You got your whole life ahead of you. You gonna tell him it's 30 years? You take a hostage, it's 30 years? - You gonna tell him, Anson? - It's time to call it quits. Just pull over, man. Fucking reading you out of the playbook. - Don't listen to him. - You take a hostage, - it's 30 years. - Danny, this is between Will and I. - Will, focus. - This guy. Your wife... you want me to call your wife right now? Do not call my wife. He's got your best interests, my friend. That's it. There's only so much I can do for you, Will. - 30 years. - You've got a family. - Ask him what happens when you shoot a cop. - Shut up! Tate will only see his daddy behind plexiglass. What the fuck are you doing? The truth is he probably won't even want to see you at all. Okay, everybody... everybody just shut up! Everybody just shut up, okay? You're gonna dig your own grave on this one, my man. I can give you an out, but I can only do that right now. We don't stop. That's my brother! William Sharp is the weak link. He is not gonna kill anyone. Cam, you need to work Will. Rerouting to surface streets. Don't lick your fingers and touch my shit. All units, Boyle Heights, set perimeters. Where is that? I don't usually go east of Downtown. You realize four million Angelenos live east of Downtown? Sorry. My husband is an environmental attorney. Okay? We like the beach. That's, like, the whitest thing I've ever heard. Well, I'm white. I can't help it. Save it for Oprah, buddy. We got shit going on. You get any of that freaking Cheeto dust in my hair, I swear... Please. You could lose a raccoon in there. Easy on the blood bank, Cam. - Will needs some of it, too. - Okay. It's fine. Just take it. So you were a Marine? Until today. It's my wife. Hey, babe. Will, where are you? Yeah, the interview went long, and, uh... and they needed somebody to start today, so... You got the job? Yeah, I got... I got the job. He got the job. He got the job. Oh, we'll celebrate. Wait, are you driving now? Yeah, there's a lot of traffic. Yeah, some car chase bank robbery thing on the news. Only in L.A., huh? Yeah, you know, they probably don't want me to be on the phone on my first day, so... call you back, all right? Will? Yeah, baby? I'm so proud of you. Not just for taking care of everything with the insurance and the money, but... for being a man. Aw, babe. One our son will look up to. - Can I see him? - Yeah. Hey, vampire princess, are you done? Are you done sucking the life out of every person in this ambulance?! Hey, what's up, big guy? Just waking up? You're so beautiful. So beautiful. I love you. Surgery? Yeah. Cancer's expensive. You know what's gonna happen? You're gonna get all his blood, and then we're gonna die in some perfectly preventable traffic accident. Fan-fucking-tastic! That's why you're robbing the banks. Yeah, that and everything else. I'm not blaming nobody. I'm here because of me. You're not blaming your brother? I think you need to be a little more careful, Cam. That's my brother you're talking about. I know it's your brother I'm talking about, but he's putting people's lives at risk. - Let me help you, Will. - Stop. What you talking about? Nothing. It's okay. I-I have everything I need. Castro? Castro? You tuck way under? Danny, listen. Um... what the hell is going on right now, man? Is this shit legal? You cannot be arrested for possession of paint. Yeah, I understand that, but th-these guys are giving me Grand Theft Auto vibes, man, and it's throwing me off. I don't know, the explosives, th-the guns. These guys look like they do this type of shit all the time. Man, I just... I just really want to go home. I really want to go home, man. You're not going anywhere, Castro. - You stay right there. - Is that Danny? - Um, uh... - Just say yes. Yeah. Give him the phone. Hey, we're all set up. You close? - Yeah. Five minutes. - All right, good. The money? I'm a man of my word. Good. Papi's gonna be glad to hear that. We're tapping his AirPods right now. These guys are nutjobs. What's going on in there? Whew!

Guys, are we on a tour of L.A., or can we get to a hospital? Why the L.A. River? It's 40 miles of empty concrete in either direction. Might be trying to lose us in the tunnels that go under the street or... Pull over. Pull over. We can see him, but we can't hide from him, either. He's watching us, trying to draw me in. Fixed-wing aircraft, zoom in, please. Cessna, bogey stepping out of vehicle. Dial that sat phone of his. Air 11, I want you to be real aggressive. Drop down and buzz him. Chase him out of there.

They thought they were being tricky going the wrong way down that one-way. But now they're cornered three blocks away. They think they shook us and that our air support is having mechanical issues. Police Cessna is watching 'em under a bridge. We're gonna let 'em relax. Then we're gonna close the net. All right? All four exits are covered. - What's going on? - Will, come on. Let's go. You can walk. - Just walk. - What? It's your time. You can walk. I'm not... No. No. I'm not leaving you, man. I mean, I would prefer you stay, just in case these guys kill me. Green?

Better hustle before they find us here. I hear one coming. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Castro. Listen. Listen. I need you to take this ambulance. I need you to go that way. - Okay? Here's 10K. - Wait, what? Anybody stops you, you tell them that you don't know why you are in an ambulance. - Okay? - Who's gonna... Who's gonna ask me that, man? Nobody. Nobody's gonna ask you that. I don't think. All right? - You don't think? - Okay? This motherfucker's crazy. We're locked down and ready to go. Air 11. We got six cars leaving. Three look-alikes. Helos, split up. That's a military trick. He's going east. You go west. I need a hard lockdown now. Air 18, direct all ground units - Get out of the fucking car! - On the ground now! Whoa, whoa. All them guns, for real? Cool, be cool. Keep it cool. They got your boy. Let's hope he don't talk. I'm having an episode. Yo, I don't even know how I got here. I wasn't feeling well. I went to the doctors, and they told me to go to the hospital. I had the motherfucking wine cooler with the medicine, and I don't know... I-I thought it was Kool-Aid. My-my niece, she-she's in seven-seventh grade. They said I didn't have enough medicine, then I had too much. Roberto, we made it. We made it. Go, go, go, go, go! Here he comes! Get down! Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, fuck. Goddamn it. We got medics? What are you doing, Danny? Ambush! Move back! Ambush! Ambush! ...the massive shoot-out at the intersection. Several officers on the ground right now... Papi special! Fuck off! Oh, hold... Whoa, whoa. Apparently... What was that? That's Roberto. No. We can't see if he's moving or not. It's-it's... Rick, pull up. Zoom out. We're gonna get off of it. Well, we hear it was a code four. Apparently, the suspect is dead. Blue-One to Control. Give me a clear frequency. All units, be advised. This is Special Agent Anson Clark, FBI. Land immediately. Yes, yes, yes, yes! Hey, we made it. Who are these guys? Just relax. They just saved our asses. Who saves us from them? You heard about Roberto? He's dead. Hey, is it true? It's a sad day today. Papi's in his office. Will. Casper. Watch the cop. No matter what, do not get out. I know, Papi. I'm sorry for your loss. It's terrible. Can't imagine how you feel right now. I think I have something to ease your suffering. Pay me my fucking money. You think you're so tough with that gun. Eight million. It's yours. Let me see it. I'll handle our money. Fuck. Keep it down, keep it down, keep it down. It's a shitshow. I don't think they like cops here. Was your... Was your hand in my stomach? Like, way in. Okay. It's all there, Papi. Hard to put a price on the life of a child, Danny. Yeah, I know, Papi. I'm sorry. Yeah. I worked for your daddy a long time. Long time. He never came close to nothing like this. Y-You think how proud he'd be of you now. Yeah. Zach's phone is in the ambulance. - Triangulate it and find them. - It's dead. You hear all that? They're getting hot out there, Papi. You two need to sit down and relax for a couple hours. We'll get the van ready for you. We can talk business while we're waiting. Nah. We're good. Yeah, no, look. And all due respect, Papi, you don't need an MBA to figure it out. That's yours. We got ours. Business is closed. Uh, no, you're right. You're right, Danny. You're right. It's not business. It is personal. My son died for this money. Yeah, and that's a hell of a lot more than most people get when they die. Well, I guess that makes him lucky, huh? No. That's not what he's saying. Just a straight split, Papi. That's what we talked about... 50-50. Papi, there's a cop in the van, huh? We're hostages, you know? Yeah, but one of them is trying to help us. Will. You've got a lot of his blood through you right now. Hey. It's my partner's. It was under my leg. No. There's too many of them. They're going to kill us. Yeah. We're family, Danny. 50-50. - Great. Let's go. - Let's go. Get the van. We out. Yeah. Let's go. Espérate, Danny. The cop. We're gonna take him off your hands. - Wait, what? - Yeah, all right. You can have the cop. We keep the EMT. No deal. We want 'em both. No, no, no, no. You brought that woman into my inner sanctum. She laid eyes on all the shit I got going on in here, everything I do for all these special people. You brought her here, regrettably, so now she stays. No, she comes with us. We take 'em both. Let's go. - Now, that's dumber than a box of rocks. - Yo. I would've thought your pretend father schooled you better than that, Will. Yeah, he schooled me on a lot. He schooled me on exactly what not to do. And yet here you are! - Yeah, here I am. - Will, c-come on. Come on. Hey, look. Listen to me. Listen to me. Stop. Stop it, Will. What are you doing? Stop. Stop it now. You want to get killed for her? She fucked us. How do you think the police knew how to block - all those intersections? - Because she told them. What? What, they just all appeared out of nowhere? - No, because she told them, Danny. - She fucked us. She did what she was supposed to do - with the bad guys, Danny. How do you... - No, no, no. No, we are not the bad guys! It is not that simple, Will. It is not that simple. We're not the bad guys. We're just the guys trying to get home. Danny, we've been trying to get home for the whole day, and you know what we've been causing? - A whole fucking wake behind us. - Listen, listen... There's a whole fucking wake of bodies behind us because we've been just trying to get home! - We don't get home, Danny! - Listen to me. Listen to me. We are almost there. Just... We've already lost, Danny. What are you trying to do, some fucking cowboy shit? Stop. Stop it. Just come. Let's go. We get the money. We get the money for your family. Let's go. Okay? We're there. Do you understand? We're there. Let's go home. I can't do it, Danny. What's going on with you? Honestly, what's going on with you? We run the town. We're there, man. Will. Will, brother, come on. Look, look. I'll give you all of it. Okay? I'll give you all of it. Danny, you know what your problem is? You think you can get away. You hear those helicopters out there? What happens next? What's the plan next, Danny? What's the next plan, Danny? I've rolled with you all this way. - What's your next plan? - We got to go. - And what's the plan after that? - We got to go. - And what's the plan after that? - Stop your talking. - We got to go. - No, it's over, Danny! We don't get to walk off into the sunset, Danny. We fucked up! We fucked up! We fucked up! And I'm not fucking up again, Danny. I'm not leaving nobody else behind. Then I guess we've reached the end of the road, huh? Wow. I'm sorry. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm just not like you. That's it. We're done. Go. Yeah, you're not like me. - You got that right. - Yeah. I'm not leaving. We caused enough trouble for today. I'm not leaving 'em. Strong choice. Carnales. What a fucking waste. Everybody just... Everybody just calm down. Just calm down. Okay? I'm sorry, brother. I'm just... I'm not like you. I-I don't... I'm not up for these kind of heroics. I'm sorry that I brought you into this. I just wanted things to be the way they were, the way they used to be, you know? But I guess so much has changed that we're just different now. It breaks my heart. Don't be sad, Danny. Ain't like he's your real brother. We used to be so in sync. And now you want to do this, and I want to do that, you know? You want to go right, and I want to go left. And I wish we just both wanted to go left together, you know? We should just go left together. Go left. Go left. What'd you say, that he's my pretend brother? He's my real brother! Multiple shots fired. Shots fired. Damn it! Cam! Cam! No! No. - Who shot him? - I don't know. Just the shoulder? You all right? Shit. Fuck. Damn it! Shoot at me, you fucker? Fuck you! Fuck you!

This is your last chance, man, so talk to me. - What is that? - Danny. What is this? What is this? This is a cop's gun. This is a Glock. Is this your gun? Where'd this gun come from? You shoot him? - You shot him! You shot him. - No. - Danny, I did. - You're lying. I did. I didn't know that it was Will. - I just opened the door, and I just didn't know... - What? And I'm so sorry.

I may have the shot. I'm opening the door! - You tell everyone to back up! - Stand down, Dyle. - Do not shoot. - Back up! Talk to me, Danny. Wh-Where's your brother? Where's Will, huh? He's dead! Danny, this is it. I've got nothing else for you. You've got to come out right now. Get those guys back! You're gonna pull your men back, or I'm gonna shoot her in the head. There's nothing more I can do for you. - Shoot him! - You think I'm stupid, Anson? No, I...

You fucking come out right now. I'm done! - Shoot him. Shoot him! - Oh, I'm done, motherfucker! Sierra-One. He's cracking the door. I-I may have a shot. Stand by. Anson, you were right. My brother didn't do anything wrong! He was a good man! Just shoot him! But I'm not! - No! - Come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. No! Got to clear a path for transport to get in here. Will... Will, I'm sorry. - It's okay. - You really helped us out with the phone. - I'm fine. - You helped us out a lot. Come on. Sit down, sit down, sit down. What happened? Huh? Tell me what happened. I don't know. Uh... Danny said he was gonna kill me, and-and... Will... Will must have heard him. They need to get him in there. Cam, Cam, Cam, Cam, he's not your friend, okay?
