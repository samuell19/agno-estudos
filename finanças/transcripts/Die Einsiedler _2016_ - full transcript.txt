As we forgive those, who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Grant to her eternal rest. Let perpetual light shine upon her. Holy Mary, full of Grace, the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of death, Amen. Go ! THE EREMITES Enjoy your meal. - Enjoy your meal ! - Enjoy your meal. Thank you. - My sympathies, Gruber. - No worries. Hurry up ! Want to join us for a beer ? I've got stuff to do. On a Saturday ? Can't you do that tomorrow ? - Everything ok ? - Yeah, yeah. It's his round today. To offspring ! The boss says the labourers will come back in winter. The three Afghans ? I'd like to know what good they'd be. At least they don't drink as much as you. What's the tall one's name again ? Who cares ? Their names all sound the same. These logs are too big for a fire. Gruber, hand me those sticks. - Is that enough ? - Yes, it'll do. - Did you get this ? - Yes, from the car park. Why ? It's soggy. Soggy wood doesn't burn, Gruber. - Nonsense. Let me try. - No, no way. I know you guys from up the mountains are a bit thick. But even you should know soggy wood doesn't burn. You can't even light a fire properly. Watch it, Gruber ! Look, we're a friendly enough bunch, but we'll stop making excuses soon. - Excuses ? - You heard him ! The fire's fine now. Everything's fine, then. So, what's up with you ? What ? Are you staying with the company ? You never say anything. - I don't know yet. - Sure, right. Sure. Hey, hand me another beer. Open one for me. Mines's gone already. Look, it's burning after all. - I've come to pick up Mr Egger. - Wait here, please. Did you bring my cigarettes ? Not again. Dammit. It broke down completely this time. - It's probably the V-belt. - No, I've already checked that. We'll see about that. This engine won't last us through winter. I've always managed to get it running 'til now. - Here. - Thank you. You're drenched in sweat. Come on in before you go. I'll give you one of father's dry shirts. All good. And my magazines ? Someone else had already taken them. Where can I get another engine at such short notice ? No idea. - Thanks for bringing me up here. - Yeah, yeah. Dog, come here ! Down, down ! Sit ! Come here, kitty. There's still a death notice for the old girl from the Gruber Farm. So she didn't last long in the valley. Poor girl, putting her in that care home there. I knew it wouldn't be any good. And the bucket in the kitchen ? - Is rainwater leaking in again ? - No, no. - It has to really pour down. - The roof timbers will soak. - I've laid out a dry shirt for you. - Thanks. Keep the shirt if it fits. Father only ever wears his work clothes anyway. Give me a section of the newspaper. See you make your way down before it gets dark. Marianne ! Marianne ! - I'm here ! - It's getting late. - Rudl ? - Yes. - Your foot's feeling better, right ? - It's getting there. Dog, come here ! Quiet ! Come here ! I should have sharpened them. The boy will be calling any minute. Need anything from the valley ? The engine's more important. - Tell him to come. I need him here. - Why ? For the roof. I can't do it on my own. You're not normally this whiny. I'm here, too. Yes ? Oh, it's you. No, I was just in the basement. Yes. Yes, OK. The cast ? No, the cast is already off. Yeah, doctors talk a lot. You can't believe everything they say. Yes... if you could bring him some of his painkillers. You may need to give him a hand with the roof. If that works for you. Rudl ! Rudl ! Rudl ? - So how much do you want for it ? - Not sure. Don't you want to check first if you can get it to run ? I'll be glad when that stuff's gone. - What's up ? - I need a gasket like this. - For what ? - For a petrol engine. I got that. Nope, nothing. Too small. Really, I never saw a strange part like that. - It's for the goods cable car. - Still difficult. - Hi. - Hello. You're not coming along for a drink ? Come on, don't refuse ! - Where's the dog ? - There's fresh coffee in the pot. - Is he still out roving the woods ? - Probably. If he's not careful he'll be shot in hunt. That dog can handle himself. The dog for sure, but father without his dog ? Your father... What about him ? Your father's already covered the roof. Of course he has. Is it still dripping ? Time to eat. Eat, you'll need it now that it's getting cold. What's wrong ? Doesn't it taste good ? No, it's fine. Come on ! I can't do with you being like this. Want some more ? You've not left father any. Isn't he coming today ? - I told you. He's out on the alp. - But the goats came down ages ago. He'll have other things to do. You know him. At this time of year ? With his beat-up foot ? So you already know. Then why ask ? - You could have told me at least. - I was going to. People will ask about him. Nobody's ever been interested in us up here. How long do you think this will work ? He would have gotten on the roof even with his plaster cast. Keep chopping. Talking won't get the house warm. I'll find a way. There's a lot more to do before winter comes. I've managed just fine on my own so far, and that's not going to change. I've no doubt he'd have preferred to stay up here. If he'd had his way, I would've stayed here, too. That's enough ! Give me that ! Get lost ! I don't want you here anymore ! Albert ! Where are you ? I think we already hit the slate. - It's leaking up there. - That's just a little water vein. - What did the geologist say ? - He hasn't been here yet. - What should we do ? - The tunnel will be shut for now. I don't want to see any of you in here. Take care of it, ok ? - Come on in. - Good evening. I was asked to bring this. Take a seat. Is that the issue with the south tunnel ? - Yes, a crack has appeared. - Yes, that's what I heard, too. And ? Can you get it under control ? The geologist hasn't checked yet. Right... He takes his time. As always. Can I go now ? How long have you been working here ? - Three years. - Three years ? - Time flies. - Yes. You do the work as it comes up. It's no different from your farm. Very true. I need men like you here. Loyal, hard-working. You know what I mean. - Is all that for the canteen ? - Yes. All for you guys. - What were you thinking ? - For you. Sure. What's that ? Are they paying you to haul crates now ? Get a move on ! We're already late ! Paola ? Tell me, and I'll let you go. I need the keys for the Jeep. - In the ignition ! - No. Then check the sun visor. I know I don't have them. Woah, Gruber's shaved his body. - Who wants Gruber tonight ? - Wait 'till the Afghans get here ! - You can take a shower with Albert. - No, please, no. Stop it ! - Now's not the time to cop out ! - Just relax ! Bastard ! Stop ! Wait. I forgot my rucksack. - What the hell is this ? - This Gruber... Which filthy swine did this ? Cowardly sods ! Yeah, yeah, laugh away. Cowardly, filthy swine. Hello ? You ? Sure, and where ? Are you ok ? How did that happen ? Have you been drinking ? Fuck you. Do you know someone to pull it out ? The company's big jeep would probably do it, but not before tomorrow. Then I might as well call the boss myself. My jeep isn't sturdy enough. Are you cold ? Get in. It's a little dirty, but warm. No. Let me get you a blanket at least. - You really don't know anyone ? - At such short notice ? No. Thanks. Who are we waiting for ? No, please stop. - Sorry. - No worries. Hey, it's ok. I'm coming. Get over there ! Mona ! Stop ! Stop ! - What are you doing here ? - Coming back from the village. If you need something, I can bring it home to you. Here. I might be able to give you more soon. Hard work pays. I've always told you that. But I don't need more. I'm going to sell the cattle. The cows are too much work for me. Your brother could have been a farmer, but you... Want some tea ? We'll get the farm to survive somehow. No, you'll do no such thing. It's finished. The farm will perish along with me. End of story ! Don't talk like that. When your siblings died in the avalanche, I swore that I would be the last one up there. Do you really not want to sleep in the bed ? Oh no. There is something. Just the very thought of how expensive a couch like that is. A straw mattress would be much more comfortable. You could earn a lot of money. Just try and sell some in the market next time. Sleep well. - Up already ? - Have you been here all night ? I got this from Gruber. I did it up a little. - You'll be dozing at work. - Got nothing to say ? I've got everything I need. Go and get changed, or you'll be late for work. Mona ! Mona. Hello. They asked me to stay on. My contract finishes as the year ends. The boss now offers a permanent one. That's good news. What's that you've got ? - An accident. - An accident ? Yes. On my way to school, as a kid. A horse-drawn buggy came by. I wanted to pat the horse, and it charged at me. You can hardly see any scars. They shot the horse. As punishment. - All sounds very tragic, doesn't it ? - Yes, it does. The strange thing is you get used to everything. Even to this work here. Get in ! Get in ! - Everything ok ? - Sure. - Where's your car ? - Garage. Really want to go to work like that ? Why not ? Congratulations, by the way. - For what ? - On your promotion. The boss couldn't stop talking about you. An alpine farm boy, and foreman now, bravo ! It's not like that. Won't your little Hungarian be proud of you ? Shame she's not staying much longer. What ? Don't tell me she kept it from you ! It's not really nice of her. Easy does it ! - Who said so ? - A quarry worker. - Rubbish. Why'd she want to leave ? - How do I know ? - Maybe she's got enough money now. - Get out. Get out, now ! I'm sure the new one is good, too. Get out ! Gruber ! Gruber ! I'll drive you home. It's open. Hello. Hello. What's up ? - Do you want a drink ? - Sure. It's cold outside. That's normal for this time of year. What's on your mind ? When are you leaving ? - It was never the right moment. - So when are you leaving ? Next week. Friday. Fine. Will you come with me ? - What would I do there ? - Forget it. Why didn't you tell me earlier that you were going ? - Because it isn't easy. - Why ? I want you to stay. I'm sorry. No... - Paola. - Boglárka. - Boglárka ? - Boglárka. No-one here could remember it. So, they called me Paola instead. And it stuck. You know each other, right ? Look after them. Leave that to Albert. Just give them instructions. Don't let them stand idle. It might best be left to someone else. - What ? - I can't. What's this nonsense ? Giving first instructions can't be such a problem. I need a few days off. Gruber goes awol and you pull this kind of crap. You do the work as it comes up. You said so yourself. You know what ? Go ! Go wherever you wish, and stay there. You needn't show up here again. I'll give you three days. Not a minute longer. Thanks. Get in. Mother ! Mother ! If you don't light the stove, you'll freeze to death. I must have fallen asleep. - What day is it today ? - Wednesday. - Shouldn't you be at work ? - No. - Why not ? - I quit my job at the quarry. - What ? - Yes, so I'm back here now. - You quit ? - Yes, that's what I'm saying. - Come, sit next to me. - On the bed ? Sit next to me, please. What good to you is an old mother and a run-down farm ? You can't stay here on your own. Your hands are freezing. I'll get you a warm drink. You don't understand. You don't understand. I brought a new engine. Mother... Mother ! Attention ! Train departing from track 3. Please step behind the yellow line. EREMITES Subtitling GRETE MÜLLER
