Here I am. Orfeo Rinalduzzi, 24 years old. A year of military service, putting out fires in Sardinia. I never met my father, but I know my mother all too well. She has chronic depression but I love her. If this were one of those moments when you have to look back on your life... ... what can you say? ... that I'm not like everyone else. - Watch where you're going! - Watch yourself, asshole! I don't go out, I don't dance, I don't like video games, but above all, I don't have any aspirations. Leave me alone! What the fuck do you want with me? Well no, there's always someone who wants to teach me something. or who comes into my life without permission. Like this guy here, this bastard in a suit. How much further, for fuck's sake? Not far. It's just there's a lot of traffic. Even his name is ridiculous. Achille. Achille De Bellis. How can you steal the name of a grand mythological figure... ... and put it on a face like that? Achille De Bellis is a man who has spent his life bent over, looking at his shoes and showing his stereotypical "happy Buddha" smile. He pretends to speak five languages, but he only knows one, the language of money. Yes, Achille even married money. Gigliola Duranti, The daughter of one of Rome's most powerful hotel dynasties. Unfortunately for Achille, he's been excluded from all of the matrimonial property. This is Guglielmo Duranti, his brother-in-law. Twice married, and twice left by his wives. He invented cuckoldry. Achille makes the decisions, but only if Guglielmo agrees. Ramona is his third wife, recently arrived from the east. Something very unpleasant has happened. I already know. - Tell them. - I have already. Good. What do I have to do with all this? Well, everything started that cursed day... Last night, something very serious happened. One of our most valued clients, Mr. Ted Terry, had his computer stolen from his luggage. This theft dishonors the name of our hotel and the chain it represents. - Don't you agree? - Yes. But I don't understand Why me? Mrs. Rinalduzzi, you're in charge of the first, second and third floors. What were you doing on the 5th floor? Outside of your working hours? Because I... was... Well, I... Speak up! I was... I wasn't on the 5th. Liar! Ms. Olivares saw you come out of the client's room at the same time that he was sending down his luggage. So would you be kind enough to explain what you were doing there? - It's that I was substituting... - For whom? For Simonetta, who's in charge of the 5th. We've already questioned her. She was in the laundry. Could you leave us alone? I'd like to speak with Mrs. Rinalduzzi. Thanks. Mrs. Annarita, you're lying. Moreover, with your record... We've done all we can to cover your... psychological problems. We've give you a very good opportunity And you've wasted it. Now we've got a problem. You don't have to finish your shift. Take off your apron, report to administration, and hand in your resignation. because you're no longer welcome in this hotel. - Is this a joke? - No. Mr. De Bellis, this story can't end like this... You're perfectly right, this won't be the end of it. I've done nothing wrong. I never stole anything. They can't throw me out for something I haven't done. I'm not a thief. I'm not a thief. To us. - Hey, you can't... - Calm down. - Mr. De Bellis? - What do you want? Who are you? Pick up the phone right now re-hire Annarita Rinalduzzi, and tell her you're sorry. Get out of here right now. Leave now, please. I'm in a meeting. No, De Bellis, you don't understand. You offended my mother. You called her crazy, psychotic, a thief, and then you fired her unfairly. So do what you have to do. If anything, it was your mother who smeared the respectability and the prestige of the chain I represent. - Don't translate this. - No. Tell them this is the chef asking for a raise. But this isn't the place to discuss this. I don't give a fuck. I've been waiting 5 hours. Make the fucking call, De Bellis. Listen to me, kid. You have to learn some manners, you clearly haven't been taught. But you have to know one thing: I didn't report your mother to the Police because I felt sorry for her. I can send you to prison in 5 minutes. And I can ruin your life in 5 seconds! - Got it? - Yeah, sure. Security?. Send De Marzis, please. Right now. In my office. Sorry. It's a disaster renewing labour contracts in Italy. Translate. You'll have this problem very soon. Translate it well. Then we're ready. I believe champagne... wherever it is, always brings good luck. Cheers, cheers. Cheers. I don't have a glass, but it's the same from me. Cheers. Damn you... damn you. MY BEST ENEMY Have they stolen your phone? Sorry. Here's your beer. Give me five minutes, I have to talk to you. Shall I scream? Fabrizio. Sorry, a coffee for the lady. Come here. Hurry up. This isn't my bar. This'll be quick. I only want to tell you that I don't want to see you again. You don't have a future, or any dreams, or desires. You spend all of your time feeling sorry for your mother. If she's sick, then put her in an institution. It's not enough to be smart, there are feelings, too. - Even when we're doing it. - Keep your voice down! You don't want me, I'm just a shoulder for you to cry on. Can't you discuss this on the phone? - Come on! We can hear everything. - Yeah... I'm going. - Have you finished, can I go now? - Watch what I'm about to do. I'm taking my phone and I'm deleting your number in front of everyone. So you no longer exist for me, now. Wiped out. - You're a loser. - Thanks. And I've cheated on you. Many times. Well, I'm keeping these. They cost a fortune, I had to work extra hours. Go to hell! You need to grow up. A lot. Go to hell! On the tables I'd like hearts made from ivy. with "25th" made out of little roses. And flames in front of the setting. It'll be fantastic. Darling, do we really need that floral composition with the number? Why spell it out? Everyone knows it's our 25th. It seems a little overdone to me. It seems like The Godfather's party in Miami. A silver wedding anniversary only comes once in a lifetime. Let's do as you say. But please don't do the party favours with the hotel logo. They're so tacky. It's a surprise. Sir! Your shoes. My God! What have you done? We pay a fortune to train the dog Can't they at least teach it where to shit? You never look where you step? What's he eating, spinach? It's green. - Hey, Fede! - Hey, Orfeo! I've already fixed that exhaust pipe for you. Terrific, Manuel. Hello. Tell your mother to come down here, I've got an audition. OK. How are you? Don't do that face. Can't you see they've made me feel better? When I'm recovered I'll give them up. I promise, honey. I know you're well. I've seen Riccardo downstairs. Don't start, don't give me a sermon. Riccardo loves me. And he's having a marriage crisis. He needs me. I know what it's like to be alone. Sometimes it's like I'm suspended in darkness. Yes. He's married and he'll never leave his wife. He won't leave her, but he doesn't love her, okay? He loves me. Yes sir, he loves me. And he doesn't care if they call me a thief, or if they fire me. Please, leave me alone. I love you so much, don't attack me like everyone else. Fix your make-up. You look like a Bronx warrior. Honey... I love you so much. I'm sorry, OK? I'm sorry. Sorry. And eat something, OK? Let's go. Please forgive me for my behaviour yesterday. Let my mother back in, please. Give her another chance. We've in trouble. Thank you. Go to hell! Good boy, Achille. Come here. - Come on, I can't wait any longer. - Are you crazy? Come on, It's more exciting. Well done, Achille. - You've gone with the leopard? - You like it? I've got a leopard in the car? You're so sexy. Kid, please, don't get in the way. Sorry. I'm in a cage with a leopard, and she's scratching me. Don't scratch me, you'll leave a mark on my neck. Hey! what are you doing with the phone? Do it with this. Cool. Give me your email address and I'll send you them. Wow, you have it all figured out. You're all mine. Let's go, Achille. I'm going to eat an entire leopard. Thanks. Two sets of binoculars? I'm waiting for a couple tonight. They're infrared. They make a great show. Are you sure this is a quiet place? No-one knows about this place, it's an oasis of peace. I'd be stupid if I bought you to a place with people around. Well, if you say so... You have to trust your loverboy. - Good morning. - Yes? - Miro? - Marcello's not coming today? - He's got a cold. - He could have called. Miro? Miro, good boy! Today you're going on a walk with a new friend. You'll tell me if he's been good to you, OK? My God! What are you going to do to him? Nothing. He didn't want to go out with you. Come on, don't worry, red-head. Sir, something terrible has happened. What's up? - But it's not my fault. - It's Cecilia? Come and see. It's the dog... The dog? - God! - Look at him. Who did this? Someone new came today, because Marcello's not well. Someone new? What did he look like? I don't remember. He was wearing a hat. And there was this as well. "The hot season has started"? Have we done something bad? Something bad to whom? To whom? This is a local idiot. Around here everything's full of graffiti. I'll look into it tomorrow. Now... Well, it's over now. Stay calm... Who's mad at us? Who? Nobody? - What's up, darling? - What's up? - What's up? - Nothing, everything's fine. No, it's just that I'm worried about the dog. Did you make any enemies? Enemies? Everyone adores me. Listen, let's go and wash this dog. or it'll get the furniture dirty. - God! - You see? It could be anyone. It's just your face. Yes, sure, of course. Have a look at these. - Be very careful. - There are more? Yes, there're more. Look. - No, my God! - No, no, no. Keep your voice down. But... but how is this possible? How is this possible? If your husband finds out about this, It's goodbye to my marriage, my daughter, my job. It's a disaster. He's not just your husband, he's my wife's brother. - Great. You're just worried about yourself. - No, come on. I wouldn't have any problems, right? What were you thinking? Taking me to that place full of peeping toms? How did that occur to you? Let's take a break for a while. - A break? - Yes. After this, we can never see each other again. Let's wait until after the wedding anniversary. No, none of the little dolls. Sorry, take it, take the little doll. You've come to break my balls? Will you leave me alone, yes or no? What are you doing? Sorry, but this guy speaks and hears better than anyone. Come on, get out, get out. What are you doing? What am I doing? Get out, get lost! Do I have to say it in Albanian, in Bulgarian? Didn't I tell you to get lost? I SAW YOU IN THE WOODS, ASSHOLE Get out. - What's happening? - Nothing. - What's up? - Nothing. He's an illegal immigrant who's struggling to get residency. Why not? Did you speak with that friend of mine? You've got to go and ask for it in my name. You're an asshole. What do you want from me? Relax, Casanova. It was you who sent me the photos. Ah, yes? How much for the negatives? You still think photos come from negatives? Well, the disc! Where did you put the photos? On a DVD, up your ass? Do you like your life? How much do you want? Is 300 euros enough? 1,300. And your car, and your house. And your garden, and even your wife. What? Relax, relax. Do you think I'm a blackmailer? Sure, I'm a blackmailer and my mother's a thief. What do you want from me? What do you want? I want to ruin you, Achille. To humiliate you. This is extortion, it's blackmail. No, it's compensation for my mother. Bye, Achille. Let's make it 1,000? You know you need them. - 1,000 and you give me the photos. - Enough already. Anyway, I'll see you again soon. See you soon. Bye, Achille. Achille, what are you doing? You want to know who sent the photos? It was him. - The deaf-mute? - He's not a deaf-mute! He's an blackmailing asshole. Let's go. Fuck you, De Bellis! You asshole! What's got into Miro? Barking all night. Miro! Come here, Miro! Asshole! I can tell there's an asshole around here! Fuck off! Show your face, fool. Show your face. Why don't you fuck off? - Show your face, asshole! - Enough! Someone's here, watching us. I can sense a negative presence, don't you understand? It's just the dog, he must have been chasing a cat. - I don't feel well, Giglio'. - Come here, darling. You need a neurologist. We'll go tomorrow. The pistol's loaded. Careful, or you'll kill us both. You promised no guns. It's OK, I'll unload it. But I haven't been feeling safe. Idiot! You drive with the headlights off? - What the fuck, driving like that? - Go to hell! Why the fuck were YOU driving like that? You were speeding. I didn't even have time to turn on the lights. Shit, look at this! I'm hurt real bad. Are you hurt? Yes, it hurts a lot. My knee is swelling up. It really hurts. Let's get you to a doctor. No, no. If you've broken something you'll need to get it in plaster. Nothing's broken! I'm fine. Look, I'm only saying: You need a doctor, now. Take a deep breath. Just a second, a second. - Just a little bit longer. - It hurts so bad! OK, we're almost there. Wait, let's go. Hold on tight, hold on. Thanks. No worries. - Wait. - Thanks. - You live here? - Yes, but... - But? - There's a small problem. What type of problem? I live on the third floor and there's no elevator. I see. I'll help you with it. Thanks. Why did you take the trouble to help me tonight? The nuns taught me to love thy neighbour. And you're always so good to all your neighbours? No, only the neighbours that I run over in my car. And if the neighbour asks you for your number, do you give it to him? No. Well, I'm going. Listen. What if my lawyer wants your number? You want to report me? No, but I want your number. What the hell? - What's happening? - My God. Mom. Mom, mom. What the fuck... Get up. Orfeo, what's going on? Pour some salt into a glass of water. I need to make her throw up. She's asleep. - Thanks. - Don't worry. The welcome wasn't the best, but it's not always like this. Why did she take so many pills? She's depressed. But she's nice. And your father? My father... He left us before I was born. Come on. - How long has he been dead? - Who's dead? Your father. My father's not dead. It's just that he left, the bastard. He lives in the north with another family. I don't know him. Why? Because... Because... Thanks. Because I don't give a shit. And if I see him, I'll kill him. I'll break his neck. Not because I hate him. I'm not one of those people... ... who go into therapy for a "missing father figure". It's just the right thing to do. You say you'd like to break people's neck a lot. Why? Because sometimes it's necessary. If you hurt me, I'll break your neck. No. And this? - It's my mother's - But it's an import. Yes, it's a pretty obscure English songwriter. Your mother's cool. When she gets better I'd like to meet her. Why did she call you Orfeo? Because of Orpheus and Eurydice? Yes, how did you know? Do you have a grandpa called Orfeo you're named after? - No. - You see? Excuse me. Cecilia, Cecilia. You don't answer at this time of the night. You are either running from something, or you want to hurt someone. - I never run from anything. - No? No. Then stay here. If I leave will you break my neck? No. I'll break my own neck. Give me your hand. Then die in peace. And call me tomorrow. See you. You idiot. And explain to me how you came back from London in a car. - You arrived at 5 AM. - I gave a lift to a friend. You give your friends lifts but you don't call your parents? And you should travel by plane! These solo road trips are dangerous. Can I drink my coffee or is it dangerous? Darling, that exam you had to give, what was it? Elizabethan Poetry, how did it go? It went well. Well? Fantastic. - You know, they might publish my work. - No! Really? So you're still writing poetry? I recall that your professor of Italian Literature... ... had a collection of your poems published. They were very, very good. They were called... "Memories of... " - "Memories... " - "Of a distracted traveler." "Of a distracted traveler". Very good. I'll write "Memories of a distracted reader" for you. That's enough now. And are you still seeing the son of that ambassador? Who, the butler? What a shame. I liked him so much... A handsome young man, from a good family... - God! - What? I have to speak to the nursery. The neighbor's dogs have destroyed our garden. This party is like a G8 summit. Then dress like a Black Bloc. Listen, honey... Are you alone at the moment or do you have someone special? Someone? No. - No? - I told you no. No one, no one? Yes. - Age? - Same as me. Tall, blue eyes, romantic kind, makes me laugh... - Family? - The best. - Rich family, yes. - Very good. And what does the boy do? Come on, give me some information. Your dad never sees you. - You want to know the truth? - Of course. - Are you sure? - Yes. What's wrong? The school is a pile of shit, the exams are worse. I'm not doing well in London. I need to talk to you. Always the self-destructive perfectionist. Nothing goes as it should. Darling, relax. I know you're a perfectionist. Relax. Let's be thankful there's a nice atmosphere at home Achille! You canceled the order for little ivy hearts? - What am I going to put on the tables? - The hearts. Put the ivy hearts there. - Order them. - I don't want them anymore. You were saying, Dad? Nice atmosphere? A coffee and a pear juice. - Here you go. - Thanks. Right away. A coffee and a pear juice. This is for table 2, right? - Orange juice. - Here, thanks. Fruit salad. - Would you like anything else? - A coffee. One coffee coming right up. Yes, just a moment. Hello. - What are you doing here? - I wanted to see where you work. - I'm a waiter. Why did you want to see? - Teach me what you do. Weren't we supposed to have dinner? We can't be here right now. Who cares? I want to stay. Who cares? In that case, a fruit juice. When is table 5 leaving? They've been here for hours. I'll bring them the check. A mixed salad for table 3. It's all me, right? Are you on holiday, Fabri? Pass it between the two. One fruit juice. YOU ARE THE BEST GIFT OF THE DAY. Another coffee. Thanks. - Are you crazy? - Come with me. - I can't, I'm working. - Please, please. - A beer and juice for table 3. - This table is mine. - Why are you so happy? - I like to work. - Sure, playboy. - This is for you. Tell me something you would never do for me. Buy you some earrings. - Here you go. - Are you planning to work in a circus? - Franco. - Yes. - This is a waiter's trick. - Cool! What's up? What if told you that I'm with a 40 year old man? with graying hair, and that he's a musician? He's twice your age And we've been living together for a year. Lithium or amphetamines? What? I divide people into two very distinct categories: Lithium people, who are slow, dull, boring and predictable, and amphetamine people, who can make you fly. They always surprise you, and they carry you far away. How's your rocker? Lithium or amphetamines? I'm sorry, it's like a professional bias for me, because of my mother. I'm not your mother. And who is he for you? He's not my father! And what am I? What am I? Orfeo, my life is a mess. I need schedules, rules... Someone to tell me what to do. I'd love it if I was like a Swiss watch. - I should live like that. - You didn't answer my question. Cecilia. You're an amphetamine. And do you know why I can't sort out my life? Because I never thought there'd be someone like you. If you talk like that, some women... ... could faint in your arms. So, faint in mine. If you fall asleep in someone's arms, they say, they become part of your family. I never felt so good. Never. When I woke up the next morning, I was alone in the car, outside my apartment. She'd left me a note... It said: "Waking someone who's sleeping is sacrilege." For the first time in my life someone was thinking of me. When she came back for her car, that afternoon, we made love again. These people are very important to me, so we'll reserve suite 356 and the bridal suite 357. And also the private dining room in the restaurant. - Come in. - This is Mrs. Ramona. Please. These are important people. - Hello, Ramona, what's up? - What's up? Look. This arrived this morning. Guglielmo almost saw it. - What is it? - Look what it is. It came in an envelope. My God, what a tragedy. If you don't fix this problem I'll kill you before your wife and my husband can kill us! Have you got a minute? - It's Guglielmo! - It's him! It's Guglielmo! Just a second, Guglielmo! But where can I hide? Here. No, there's an alarm over there. I can come back later if you're busy. Just a second! Where the hell? Here. - It's the only place. - Here. - My dearest friend! - Leave it open. - No! - Do you know what the... ? - What? What the risk is when you have a young wife? - No, what? - Sooner or later she'll deceive you. Why? Do you have any suspicion? Suspicion? It's a certainty, Achille, a certainty. - OK, that's enough! - It's certain, it's a tragedy. - The computer! - What can I do? It's terrible. Let's talk about it calmly. We'll be calm, and we'll talk. - Guglielmo. - Yes? Look me in the eye. I've got something important to tell you. - Don't be distracted. Look at me. - I'm looking at you! I wouldn't believe that Ramona is deceiving you, even if I were to see it with my own eyes. - Look at me! - I'm looking at you! Do you know why? It's because she's deeply in love with you. And she's a deeply serious woman. I already know that, you should know. - The problem is something else. - What's the problem? - It's that I... Keep still. - It's that I've got... Come on! I've got problems... I have problems. serious problems with... erections, get it? I know the same happened to you. You solved it with some pills. I wanted to know if you could get me some, I don't know... - God, forgive me. - No, man. I'm sorry but I'm ashamed. What do I do? It's not easy. No, it's OK, OK. - Tell me, tell me. - A friend is honest, right? Of course, sure. But listen, I want to tell you something. Keep looking at me, don't be distracted. I'm looking at you! Then I'll tell you this. Enough anxiety. Enough of chasing ghosts, enough of this... I'm sorry, sorry, Excuse me. Enough of this performance anxiety. The tragedy of this era is performance anxiety. Everything's here. Enough! - So, will you get me some? - Sure. Great. You're a true friend. Thanks. - Are there any side effects? - Not at all! - For 18 hours you'll be like... - 18 hours? No! - Does Gigliola know? - No. Of course, sure. So she's happy. Great. 18 hours. Fantastic! It's all thanks to Gigliola. My old friend, how've you been? Thanks for coming. - Come here, love. - Here you are. Hello to you all. - We've got a surprise. - What is it? We've prepared something. Come on, darling. Excuse us a second. Excuse me. Ladies and gentlemen, I feel it's my duty to propose a toast to the most beautiful couple in the world. To you, Gigliola, my sweetest and most affectionate sister. And to you, Achille, the man who's made my sister happy. Who has advanced so brilliantly the interests of our hotel group. Why is he mentioning the job? It's so tacky. My wife and I have been together 5 years married and what we wish for tonight is to be able to also reach this magnificent anniversary in 20 years, with the same love and the same enthusiasm that our Gigliola and Achille are living. - Would you like to say something? - Of course. I'd like to say this is a special night, a very special night. A night of silver. - To the couple! - Thank you. Thank you, brother. If you'll let me, I'd also like to say something. Like him I'm also enchanted with this wonderful evening. As a politician I feel a little envy. Because I believe this marvelous couple has something which is lacking in our party: cohesion and harmony. Once more, congratulations. Thank you. That was great, thank you. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to go against the tide. I'd like to congratulate another couple... - Do you know him? - No! Yes, yes, yes. Mr. Achille De Bellis doesn't lack for anything. Surprise. Like all of those in high places, Achille has a beautiful house, a beautiful wife, A fine car, and a very fine bank balance. and most importantly, Achille has an extremely beautiful lover. - A beautiful lover. - No, no. It's a joke that we thought up, him and me. Yes, but no. Young and beautiful. And very photogenic, I have to say. Congratulations madam. You come out well in the photos. You too, Achille. Let's see... Allow me to congratulate the true couple of this evening. Don't move, I want to hear this. Achille and Ramona! They have so much fun together. Congratulations, Achille. So much fun together. Don't move! - Who are these people? - Who are these people? - No, it's not me! - How can it not be you? Where are you? I'll kill you in front of everyone! You're causing a scene in front of everyone. - I'll kill you! - Shit! Bitch! Guglielmo! Ladies and gentlemen, it's all been a planned joke. A photo montage. Music! Don't leave, there's music. The fireworks! We haven't had the fireworks? Come on, enjoy! Let's dance, ladies and gentlemen. Stop, asshole! Stop! What have you done? What have you done? I didn't know. Cecilia, I didn't know, I swear to you I didn't know. - What didn't you know? - I didn't know! - What is it that you didn't know? - I didn't know that you were his daughter! If I'd have known, I wouldn't have done this. You're a piece shit. If you like I'll say it more kindly. You're worthless. I beg you, Cecilia, listen to me. You're fake and mediocre. like most of the men I've known, including my father. Let it all out, darling, it'll make you feel better. Pour it out. You'll feel better. I assure you it was only a moment of weakness. - You want to know the truth? - Tell it to me! I didn't even enjoy it! You pimp! Liar, hypocrite! When did this story start? You pimp! Why do you call it a story? It was an episode between parentheses. - Between relatives! - Between parentheses! Relatives! Oh, between relatives. I get it now. Anyway I told her a thousand times: "Stop it, stop it. Forget it." - Was this where you were saying that? - Look. If the photo could talk, it would tell you. I was saying: "Stop it, stop it." Unfortunately it's a photo and it can't speak. I'll tell you how things are. When I met you you were nobody, a bullshit graduate with patches on your pants. - It's true, it's true. - And what do you do? Cheat on me with that whore. No. One cheats with the heart and it wasn't like that. - Get out of here! - My heart never cheated on you. Get out of this house! Now go by the hotel and collect the four things that you have. Then go by administration. From today you're no longer welcome in the hotel. You've got every right. If you attempt to put one foot in reception - I'll punch your face in. - OK. - And I really mean it. - I'll never come back again. Send someone to collect your things. I don't even want to perceive the smell of you. Cecilia, we've got to talk. I owe you an explanation. You've let yourself be blackmailed by a kid. You've told a heap of lies to everyone, including me. All it was was a moment of tiredness. - No. - Yes. If you're tired, you go to the Maldives not make a hypocrite of yourself in front of everyone. It's been terrible. Please, stay close to me now. Don't leave me alone, I need you. Tonight was the first time in my life I was ashamed of you. What did you do to make him angry? - I had my reasons. - I asked you a question. I fired his mother. She'd stolen a computer from a suitcase. She's a thief. I had to do it, I couldn't avoid it. That kid screwed both of us over. What? What are you saying, darling? Why both of us? Why are you saying that? You're mixed up in this? Why? He's the guy I told you about. My God! Him! You get it? It's him. Wait, darling. Darling, don't go. Don't call me darling! What are you doing? Darling, something wonderful happened. They've given Riccardo a role, something great. Guess who he is. The protagonist! Oedipus! They'll be on tour. Something cool, alternative. "Oedipus in the sewers", all of Europe. And he wants me to go with him. We'll travel around in camper vans and I'll cook for them. Imagine that! Riccardo will be in a show for real. Look, I've bought this for the journey. Do I look good? Why that face? It's not good to see you like this. Like how? I'm very happy. I'm just hoping you're joking, mom. Who are you like that every time you see me happy? - And how long do you think it'll last? - As long as possible. Because I'm tired of this life. I want to live! I want to start living! And I'm sorry you don't see how bad I feel and how much I need this. This what? This is a pile of shit! Orfeo, you've got to stop meddling in my life. Riccardo and I love each other. You don't understand, he left his family for me and I lost my job for him. - What do you mean? - No, nothing. - How is it nothing? - Nothing. - Nothing what? - Nothing! - What do you want to say? - Nothing. Nothing what? Nothing what? I did it, OK? It was me! I stole one thing from someone who has 50. Riccardo couldn't buy it even in 10 years. What did you do? I stole the fucking computer! It was just a fucking computer. for Riccardo's job. Bye. I'll call you every day. Mom. This is for what you've done to my family. You're joking, right? I didn't do anything to you. Let's go to the emergency room. OK. Help me at least. Come on, help me. Let's go get some help. This is nothing. Come on, help me, I can't take you down the stairs. Let's go. We made it. Thanks, guys. Slow. We're safe now. - Has there been an accident? - No. Well, yes. Motorcycle? No, unfortunately at home. Was he on roller skates? Come on, let's go. We're already in the Emergency room. Don't worry, it's nothing. - You're Mr. De Bellis? - Yes, why? - The doctor would like to speak with you. - Why? I don't know, but he asked for you. Doctor? Is there a problem? It was a good knock, wasn't it? We have to take an X-ray to see if there's a brain trauma. So you were the only one to help Mr. Rinalduzzi? That's obvious. And where were you when the guy fell and bashed his face? Where was I? - Where was I? - In the kitchen. - What? - You were in the kitchen. - In the shower! - You too? Shit! No, it's just that it hurts. Yes, we were both in the shower. In other words you were both together in the shower? We were showering together. It's that I've got a very small hot-water tank. and the hot water doesn't last very long. And since he's a friend... - Exactly. - I got out of the shower first, I slipped and fell. I'm actually lucky he was there. Exactly. OK. - Are these guys gay? - Shit! Can't you see? Anyway... Is there imminent danger? Will he be fine? He has to stay here a night under observation. No, I want to go home. - You'll have to sign. - I'll sign, I'll sign. He wants to go home. He needs to rest and someone to look after him. - You're together, right? - Yes, together. - We're together. OK, let's go. - Hands off! Go! Wait, wait. Wait! - Which is it? - The one in the middle. - The one in the middle? - Yes. Good. Hide in here forever. - They've stolen my car! - Alfredo, shit! Alfredo? He's a friend of yours? No, he's obsessed with cars. You left it unlocked. I want my car back! Do you know him? I don't just know him, The whole neighbourhood knows him! If you don't bring me my car I'll open your head like a watermelon. Calm down, don't shout. I'll make a call and we'll try and sort it out. No, we won't just try, we'll make sure. We look like two retards... - Let me hold on here... - I get it already! OK! Don't shout! You came into my life like a curse. Where the hell are we going? To see a friend. Don't move around so much. Follow what I do! We could fall over! - I can't hold on with my hands. - Calm down, you bastard, stay still. I can't see anything. If you keep shifting around, we're fucked. Don't talk, watch where we're going... My helmet fell off. Stop, stop... I can't stop. There's no time! What if the Police stops us? - Stay down, keep down please... - What do you mean? - Keep down, hide... ! - My helmet... ! - Wait here, I'll talk to him... - What are you... - It's OK - Hi. - Hi, Bire. Hi. This is... They took it from him? Alfredo sure knows who to pick. Listen, can't you help me... He won't talk to me. Don't get me involved, or he'll burn this place down... If you want to meet him, you know where to find him... I just don't want to call him, he's upset with me too... Can't you just call him? Are you crazy? Excuse me one moment... - How old is Alfredo? - What does it have to do with... I asked a question. How old is Alfredo? He's about 30, and twice your size... I'll talk to him... I don't know why I'm wasting my time with two kids like you Let's go, Orfeo. Great guy your friend, yeah? - Now I've got to go with him. Bye. - Bye. Come with me to look for the car, please. OK, it's the first aisle, at the end to the left. Aren't you coming? - No... - Why not, Mr. Tough Guy? Are you a tough guy only at parties? I'll show you how it's done. Confidence. Courtesy. Excuse me? Good evening. Listen... I like to look at people in the eye. What the hell do you want? Get the fuck out of here. He shot at me... I told you! - He's crazy! - Let's get the hell out of here... Hi, Tania... - Hi, Orfeo. - You dyed your hair Did you see Alfredo? I saw him in a car, but he didn't stop... What kind of car? It was a big, blue car, I think. It's mine! It's my car! You're leaving? I never see you, now you leave so soon? Come on, I'll make you happy... Make ME happy. Let's go look for the car, OK? See you. - Why'd you take me to a whore? - I'm helping you find the car! Fuck. Hurry up! We're here! Come on! Achille. Take it easy, OK? That's my advice. - What do you mean "take it easy"? - Don't get aggressive, stay calm. - OK? - In other words? Make him pity you. It's the only way. Excuse me, Mr. Alfredo, I appeal to... he's Alfredo! Bad start. Mr. Alfredo, I'm appealing to your sensibility, to your good judgment, to your deep humanity. I'm a man who's lost everything today, I've lost my wife, my daughter, my job and my dignity. You're an asshole! If you've lost all that in one day, it means you're an asshole. What can we give him? We've got a Punto, a Panda and a Stilo. And an Escort. All in good condition. Excuse me, I lost an Audi, and you offer me a Fiat Punto, a semicolon, an exclamation mark? What is this? What the fuck is this? This is a shame! A shame! Enough, please! Enough what? I'm in charge here. Stop clowning around. I'm only telling you: you should be ashamed. The next step is to go to the Police. What is this place you've brought me to? Shut it. Take him to the Emergency room so he'll stop breaking our balls. What a surprise! Welcome. - Another time in the shower? - We must be unlucky. Do you guys shower in olive oil? Just drop it, please. How are you? Don't worry about the car. I'll... I don't want to see you again! Get lost! Okay? Achille, just one thing. God! I can't stand your voice. - When will the taxi get here? - Just a few minutes. It's just something very important, then I'll go. It's about my mother. Go straight to hell, you and your mother. You don't understand what you've done to my life. You've ruined my life, OK? So I'm telling you one thing: get lost! Is that clear? - Did you call a taxi? - Here. - We're going to Sabaudia. - Sabaudia? - It's about the computer! - God! Bash him with the door! I told you to go! Go away! EMPLOYMENT OFFERS You're taking the beach house, too? Where am I going to sleep? In a tree, under a bridge? That house belongs to us both. Then I'll claim my half, that's all. You know what I realise from all of this? I realise I've spent 25 years of my life having to show you what a porter's son can do! Get out! - Hello, Achille. - What do you want now? No, nothing. The car. I've brought your car back. They gave it back to me? No, I found it. Here it is. One of the doors is gray. - It's missing the right seat. - Yes. - And the GPS and stereo. - Yes. What the hell have you brought me? This is the car. You've got the car, you've got the motor. It's the best I could do. Leave it here unlocked. I don't give a fuck. Goodbye. Achille, one last thing. Then I'll go and you won't see me again. I have to apologise. My mother is a thief. She really did steal that fucking computer. and above all... Who would have thought... she'd do it for that asshole? I didn't know, I didn't know. I'm sorry. If I had have known... That's all. I don't know what to do. I feel like shit. Look, let's do something positive. Everyone takes their own path, okay? I don't want to see you again. Agreed? Hello, honey... You saw, they cut off the light... We forgot to pay the bill Listen, honey... they dismissed Riccardo... unfairly... All out of envy, all for a game of envy So, I'm asking you a favour... Take it easy on him, he's very depressed. Come again, mom? Honey, listen to me... Tomorrow, before you go to work, would you mind buying some coffee? It ran out today. Perhaps you could also buy some milk and biscuits. Biscuits, mom? And milk. Nothing else? You think that's what my life is? I do your shopping, I pay your bills, I come home and hear you fuck, I help you vomit, I help you off the floor, and get you those fucking pills like a fucking drug dealer? How the fuck can you live like this, mom? Is it those the pills you keep taking? Is it the pills? There's no pills for me. I have jack-shit, you understand? I have jack-shit. Jack-shit. Jack-shit! You know what we're going to do? - I'll take some pills. - No, honey, listen to me... Please. Give me the pills, mom. - Please, stop. - Go on. - Don't be like that. - Give me those fucking pills... Get me those shitty pills - Stop it... - Give me those fucking pills! Where are they? Are they these? Are they these, mom? Are they these? - Are these the pills, mom? - Honey, please... Do these make you feel better? - I'm sorry. - These make you feel better, mom? Are they these? Then kill yourself with them! Kill yourself! I feel sorry for you, mom. I feel sorry for you. - Bye! - Orfeo! Come in early tomorrow, don't do what you always do. Yes, yes. Are you Orfeo? Yes, and you? I'm Bob. Bob Murray. Bob Murray? Cecilia's man is this drunkard? And he's come from England to tell me that since Cecilia met me, she hasn't been the same. It's terrible, I know, but his desperation gave me the hope that I needed. I had to find Cecilia. And for that I had to make an ally out of my best enemy. I'm speechless. Now it turns out that my daughter wrote the lyrics of this guy's songs. Look at you. I can't believe you're her father... ... and don't even know where your daughter is. Listen, let's not all speak at once. The most incredible thing is his band, Katerina R., Nobody cared about them before Cecilia came about. But since she started writing lyrics for them, they got a cult following. Even my mom has their CD: "Kill the father". My daughter wrote lyrics about killing me? Yes, you get shot. Shot? What have I ever done? Why do we have to believe this nonsense? My daughter wouldn't fall in love with him. Look at him, he looks like a beggar. Cecilia is a girl who lives in her own world, precise, ordered, full of rules, of study. I don't understand. How could she hook up with someone like that? Look, it's his third joint. He's burning the sofa and also himself. This is breaking my balls. Anyway, I don't believe Cecilia wants to see me dead, it's impossible. It's one of two things: either I haven't understood shit about my daughter, or maybe... Come and see Cecilia. - What's that? - Katerina R's page. I'm speechless. What is this? This is my daughter? I have no more time left. I've some gigs to do. For me it's not only a matter of love. This affects my job. Take him away, please? - Get him on a bus. - I've got a car. Don't show him the way, let him get lost. Go away, dickhead. I need Cecilia to know... "KILL THE FATHER" I don't understand my daughter at all. And to think that six months ago, she told me... "Dad, will you come to London"? That wasn't an invitation, it was a cry for help. For sure. When I think that, instead of me, that charlatan in a leather jacket was next to her, it drives me crazy... I tried to call her yesterday, and it was disconnected. - I don't know where she is. - You let a month go by? You didn't call her until yesterday? I was ashamed, OK? The truth is I was ashamed. But now I've got to find her. I must find her. Listen, I've got to tell you something. At least once in your life you've got to do something good. Listen to me. Tomorrow, you've got to help me. - Let's go, Achille. - Is this where you got in? Jump here. - OK, push. - OK, 1, 2... Are you nuts? Are you made of lead? And you like to play Macho man? Come on, let's go. - Concentrate. - OK, but you push. Come on! Come on! - Perfect. - What's happening? Your wife. My God, your wife! - Hey, where are you going? - I'm here. You're leaving me here like a moron? Another car, I'm going. - You're leaving me like this? - I'm going. Sir! Dolores, you haven't seen me. Today I'm transparent. You can't come here. This house is still mine. And they're paying you under the table. Quiet! Where are you? Where the hell are you? THE BEST TRIP OF MY LIFE MEMORIES OF A DISTRACTED TRAVELER To professor Giulio Accorinti who showed me the way when I was lost. So we have to go to Lake Como with this trash bin of a car? Tell me, because one us is going by train. You're better off staying with me, because as sure as God, I'll find Cecilia. I've never done anything good, but this time I will. Like when you write a report and you see you wrote a shitty sentence. What do you do? You cross it out, and start with a new line. For me, Cecilia is that new line. This is my car. I gave up smoking and smoke bothers me. Smoke outside or throw it out, please. There you go. Should I drive? You look tired. I'm not tired. Also, at this speed, it will take us two days. Okay, you drive, but be careful. This highway is full of speed cameras. OK? - What's happening? - How would I know? - You broke it? - Me? Now I broke it? You broke my car? This car can't do 200? You didn't return my car. There's no motor inside. It's a futuristic sculpture. What do I do? What do I do? Where did this car come from? Why? Because it's got parts from an A4, a part from an A6, - And a part from an Iveco. - An Iveco? This car is a mess. It's laughable. It's a long story. What the hell did you bring me? Now what? We've got rental cars, but not much choice. - What is there? - We've got vans, minibuses, and small camper vans. Why are you laughing? I've we're going on a summer holiday, I'll grab my swimming shorts. Listen, would you have a 2000? Yes, we've got a new one. You can see it if you like. I'll take it. Let's go. - It's not accepting it. - What? It's the third time. It's not accepting it. Maybe my mobile demagnetized it? No, it's either blocked or out of funds. It's blocked. - What do we do? - I'll pay cash. As you wish. 500 euros. - 500 euros? - One week, 500 euros. - And 4 days? - I'd have to calculate... - No, OK, one week. - I need some ID. - Here you go. - Thanks. For sure, blocking the card is a humiliation. - So, I should go ahead? - What? - Should I do it? - Yes. He's a moron, don't pay any attention to him. Why do you think Cecilia needed advice... ... from an 80 year-old professor who lives by the lake and appeared like, out of nowhere? - I sense it. I'm her father. - Yeah... Don't insist, don't get mixed up in this. You know, it's incredible. You know my moron of a father lives here? Let's go. What are you looking at? He's looks like he's about to eat her... Look, that's not sex. That's love, OK? You know jack-shit. Thank goodness for this scene. It might inspire a little bit of feeling. Your soul is barren... Barren, you, soul... What an old-timey way to talk, Achille. You sound like Ugo Foscolo. Will you do me a favour? Take off your socks. It's like you're wearing a codfish. This hotel room smells like a fishing boat. Go get washed. This one's good. Cecilia wrote it 4 years ago. Read it and tell me what she meant. I don't have my glasses. You want me to read it to you? I'll read it. "Ashes. Sometimes I doubt the sun is made of fire and that I see a star, not the moon, that love is a heavy yoke that I carry with weariness thinking of you, father. The wound opens slowly and I cry again with the weight of your absence that crushes me, that leaves me stranded". What does it mean? "My father". Who is it? Is it you or the Heavenly Father? Couldn't it be destiny? Fate? Must it be me? It's my fault? Ah, yeah, destiny. And when it says: "the weight of your absence... that crushes me, that leaves me stranded", is that destiny? Couldn't it be the absence of faith? No, it's my fault, surely. What faith? "Absence of faith". Sure, what you said. Faith, Achille? It says here that you weren't around. The poem is called "Ashes". The ashes are you. Hey, you're very presumptuous and very arrogant, alright? I won't talk to you any longer. Turn out the light and go and wash up, is that clear? Good night. Good night. "Ashes". You'll have to explain to me what you're doing with two mobiles. It should be obvious. One is for my family and the other is for work. - Things which you don't have. - Get off my ass. They don't ring any more. Let's hope they ring. Let's hope. This guy! Snores like a trunk! Achille... Achille... Achille... - Come on, come on... - Any news? - Cecilia... - Nothing to do with Cecilia... I need to show you something. That couple from before. What was it? "No sex without love"? "True love"? It's 3 AM. What the...? Come and look at this, "true love". - But who is it? - There. I can't figure out their position. - I'll show you the position. - What are you doing? - I'll take a picture. - Whose picture? It's that couple from before. They were kissing. That "true love" bullshit couple. Come on. It's 3 AM. What are we even doing? This is nonsense. Fuck, Achille! Pull me up! How? You weigh 85kg! Don't let go of me! Don't let go, Achille! - Oh, God! - Don't let go! My clavicle just popped off. Fuck , Achille! My shoulder blade went out if its socket. I'm sorry, but I have to let you go! You're crazy, you want to kill me! Please, Achille, hold on for one more second! I can't. I have to let you go. On three, I'll let you go. One... - Two... - No! I can't. On three, OK? One... One, two... Two... two... three... Oh God, Someone call a doctor... I can't believe he actually let me fall. All for a shitty picture! - Excuse me. - Yes? - Mr. Baudoni's house? - The engineer? - Engineer? - He doesn't live in town. He lives 3 km past the bridge over the river. What? Oh, hi, Achille. Were you sleeping? Yeah, you woke me up. What's up? I just wanted to let you know I borrowed the car. I filled up the tank. I also took 70 euros from you. I'd like to know who authorized you to take my car keys, and take money from my wallet. Who? Hey, I need the car for one hour. I can't explain now. I need to go visit someone... Who do you need to visit that's so important? Who? Who, answer me? Who do you need to visit? Who is the asshole you need to visit? Tell me. It's my father, Achille. Hurry. What are you doing here, what are you looking for? - How did you get in? - This is private property. It's fine. Thanks, Santoro. No, he doesn't have a record. Then I'll write: "He stealthily entered the garden of the Baudoni property." Add: "Easily avoiding the electronic surveillance". Inspector, how long will it take to finish the report? I need to move my appointments. We must complete the last formalities. Half an hour. I'm going to call my office. Of course. Silvana, we need to push the appointment back 45 minutes. Excuse me, can I go to the bathroom for a moment? OK. What is it? I'm in the police station. They caught me when I tried to see my father. They're accusing me of trespassing, do you get it? Come quickly. Please, come quickly. Please make something up. I'm in deep shit... Thanks. See you. How am I supposed get there? What can I say? Shit, Shit... I'm looking for a youth who is in for questioning. - Last door the right. - Thank you. - Where is my son? - Where are you going? Stop. - And my son? - Who are you? Idiot! You're a real idiot, you know that? - Achille, what... ? - Quiet, I'm your father. You've got to listen to me! Quiet down and lower your voice! What were you trying to prove by jumping that wall? That you're 13 years old and still jumping walls? Your mother's been waiting two days waiting for a call. Why don't you call her? A bit of respect for your mother and for me because I'm your father, OK? - No, come on... - Sometimes it's necessary. - Excuse me. - It's nothing. Listen, I'm a desperate father. Because he's a good boy but he's always given us a lot of trouble. We could deal with him until he was about 13. But since he turned 15,16... it's like opening a kennel and dogs run off everywhere. Excuse me, please. Matteo? No, nothing's happened. No, nothing, nothing. I'll be there in a while, tell mami. Bye, Matteo, bye. Inspector, we're going to do this. Let's leave it like this. But I'd like to give you some advice. Keep an eye on your son. These days young people need guidance. Exactly. Let's leave it like this. Say thanks. Say thanks. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Let's go, Attilio. We're going too. We're going home. Excuse us. You're welcome. To be a father these days... - What an asshole! - What? He didn't even realise how ridiculous that was. "These days, children need guidance". You're still thinking about that? Didn't you see? I know. With that countryside playboy scarf? Come on, that guy is no longer your father. Be glad you're free of him. Come on, come on. OK, man. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hey! I'll drive now, OK? Come on, the keys. Come on, let's go. Did you hear how he spoke? "Matteo, mami... mami, Matteo. I'll go". Fuck that guy! - It's here. - Here? Sure, it's here. Here. - It's open. - Wait, let's ring the doorbell. - Come on, it's open. - You're just going in like that? Anyone here? - Professor Accorinti? - Get in! There's someone here. They're cleaning. - Professor! - Anyone here? Professor! Professor! Profess... - Someone's here. - It's the maid. Excuse me. Finally. I've been waiting for you since yesterday. The washing machine's not working. It doesn't rinse or spin. She thinks we're plumbers. - Ma'am, we're friends of the professor. - Oh, I'm so sorry! - Don't worry. Is the professor here? - No, he's at the library. We're looking for Cecilia, a blonde girl, his friend. - My daughter. - Has she been here? Yes, she came and stayed here one night. - When? - When? - When? - When was she here? - When? - About 3 weeks ago. More or less. - And then? - Then I don't know, a phone call. - She left a number and I wrote it down. - Great, fantastic. - Where's the note? Is this it? - No, no. - What are these numbers? - Cool it, we're going to find it. Here it is. I'm sorry, it's a bit stained. Oil. Istanbul. Grand Café. Why Istanbul? It was her first trip overseas, you know? Back then we were a happy family, united. She was 12. and she enjoyed the trip so much that when we were flying back, she said to me: "Dad, I wish we were going there, not coming back". Well, what is she doing in Istanbul now? What kind of place is Grand Café Istanbul? Is it a bar? It has to be a bar, a big bar. A Grand Café Istanbul that could be anywhere. My daughter is in Turkey. I'm her father, and when a father feels something, he feels it. Ah, now you feel things? I think it's crazy to go straight to Istanbul to look for a Grand Café. What are you on about, Achille? You don't have to go. I'll go. I'm her father. It's got nothing to do with you, is that clear? Where are you going, Achille? where are you going? Let's throw the money out the window! We're not throwing the money, I'm throwing it. Because I've got money, you haven't. Goodbye, Orfeo. Let's go. Achille, you're a real asshole. What did you say to me? I'm at a loss for words. You're truly a huge asshole. Excuse me, I didn't understand you. What did you say to me? What? Say it again. You're an asshole. And thank God you're old. When you go to the Emergency room, don't say you slipped in the shower, say that an old guy hit you. Understood? Go to hell! - Excuse me, sir. - What is it? - Is there a shoe shop nearby? - Yes. - Where is it? - Down to the church, then towards the lake, the shoe shop is... - All right, all right... [speaks dialect] I didn't understand shit, I'm sorry! Grand Café. Grand Café Istanbul, Stuttgart, Sofia, Geneva. Geneva. Where are you? - What? - Italian? Yes, why? No, I don't want anything. I don't want anything, I'm not interested. No, I'm not interested. I'm looking for the Grand Café Istanbul. - Yes, I know it. - You know it? Your money? - You want money? - Yes. How much? A little tip. - Come with me. - 100? That's a 100 note! Come here. Grand Café. We've got Cecilia! - Seriously? - Yes. Come on, come on! Money? You want 100 for each clue? Let's agree on a fixed rate! Brothel! - We're going to a brothel? - Yes, come on. What do you mean, a brothel? My daughter's in a brothel? Holy Mother! Come on. Cecilia. I'm going. No, no, thank goodness. Where the fuck did you take me? The Grand Café is over there, after the bridge. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Thank you, goodbye. - Goodbye. I asked for a decaf, not a normal coffee. Pay attention. I'm very sorry. Do I have to keep waiting for my glass of water? Sorry, sir, I'll bring you the water right away. Hi. Hi. How are you? What's up? What did you do to piss off those two so much? Nothing, I spilled some water and I got the coffee wrong. What are you doing here? We're going to make him a coffee. Where are you going? Come here, Orfeo. Why are you making it so long? It's not an americano. The coffee has to go out quickly. Otherwise, it gets cold and it's horrible. The saucer is fundamental, otherwise it stains. Orfeo, come here. Have you finished? - No, you've got to listen to me. - Not now. Yes, I'm not going without you. I'd prefer to make coffee all my life. Please, they're looking at us. Cecilia, what are you doing? Are you crazy? Throw that guy out of here now and go back to work. Let's go! Thank you, goodbye. Achille, Orfeo. Why are you video calling? I'm sorry. I wanted to where you ended up. Where? I'm in Istanbul! In a hotel? Yes, of course. I'm not going to sleep under a bridge. - What hotel are you in? - Why do you care? - In the Marmara Hotel. - Marmara Hotel. Any news of Cecilia? Yes, I'm with a guy who knows the city well. - Come on. - Just a moment. - Listen to me. - Come on, hurry up. Quick, because I'm in the middle of a bridge and there's a lot of wind. I want to tell you that I'm sorry, that you were right. Of course I was right. Where did you want to go and look for her? I'm hanging up, my battery's running out. Goodbye, Orfeo, goodbye. Come on, man! Hey, I'm paying you. It's not like I'm torturing you. Here I am. Sorry. This time you won't get away from me. - Any news for me? - No. A bottle of whiskey in the lounge, for me. Yes. Hey, mister! Someone's looking for you. Someone's looking for you. - Someone's looking for me? - Yes. - Where? - There. Where were you? Perhaps it's better this way.
