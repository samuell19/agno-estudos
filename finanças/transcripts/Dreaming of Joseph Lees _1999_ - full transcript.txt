When I was 14, I fell in love with my cousin, Joseph Lees. He was like no one else in our family. He knew about books and art and wanted to travel the world. But I was just a girl. And though he never thought anything of me, I couldn't forget him, not even after he went away, not even after the accident. 1... 2... 3... 4... Some people believe there's only one other person in the world that can set your heart on fire. I always thought it was Joseph Lees. When we were still living in the north, I was waiting for him to come back home, waiting for him all the time, but he never did. And then my dad brought us to live down here, and I don't even know where Joseph is anymore. I don't really see anyone, only my family and the men in the sawmill. And Harry Flite. Want to give a hand here? -Harry. -Eva. -What are you doing here? -I had to see you. Come out to the farm tonight. What for? You know what for. Maria won't be there. Come on, Eva. Give him a kiss. So, will you? Harry, I've got work to do. You're the only one left, you know. Only one what? Never been to heaven and back. Well, I shan't be going there with you, Harry Flite. Who with, then? Eva, I can't find my book. It's at the bottom, Robert. What have you got there, Janie? Here's Uncle Walt with his hat at the chamber ball. Who's that, Dad? Joseph Lees. Now, he's your Uncle Walter's nephew. -I thought he was your cousin. -Is he? I suppose he must be. Now, that was taken at the party they gave him just before he went away to... Where was it now? Islamabad? Italy, Dad. Who's the girl? Ooh, um... That's Eva, Dad. Ooh. Hee hee. What happened to Joseph Lees? He lost his leg. Yeah, lost it in a quarry. Stupid, I suppose, but then you never really know what makes people do things, do you? Then what happened to him? I don't know. I don't know. What do you think he's up to now, Eva? I don't know. Haven't really thought about it. Joseph... Lees, Lees. It's like a love story that goes on forever. I promessi sposi. The illustrations are by Antonio Laeli. This book belonged to my grandfather in Italy. Take a look. Whereabouts did he live in Italy? In the north, he worked in the marble quarry at Carrara. I've got a cousin who lives in Italy and worked in a quarry. I'm not sure if it was marble, though. Was he a laborer, your cousin? No. He's a geologist. Eva, you've got to hear this. It's the best thing I ever listened to in my life. What is it? It's my heart and my soul ripped out and turned into music. Come on, come with me. -Harry. -Come on. Close the door. Close it. ♪ Never know how much I love you ♪ ♪ Never know how much I care ♪ ♪ When you put your arms around me ♪ ♪ I get a fever that's so hard to bear ♪ ♪ You give me fever ♪ ♪ When you kiss me ♪ ♪ Fever when you hold me tight ♪ ♪ Fever ♪ ♪ In the mornin' ♪ ♪ A fever all through the night ♪ How long do we have to stay?

Why, this is the mother. This is Sara Saddlebag. Now, she's had the most piglets of them all. She's had more than even old Lily over there. You know how many she's had? 97 piglets since we got her. But you know what? 11 of them died. -What of? -Crushed by the mother. -How many has this one had? -This one here? -That's not had any. -Why not? Ain't it kin? Yes, it's kin as you like, but it's a boy. See how it goes wiggly round? Just like a little kid's curl. Ooh. Maria. Eva. Where are those earrings I bought you? Didn't want to wear them just to come up here. What, not even for our Harry? Maria, for god's sake. You got no shame, girl. Did he say anything to you? Who? Wasn't talking to you. What did he say, then? Nothing. What did he say? What did he say? He said... -He said... -Yeah? That he'd give me a bag of licorice if I left you alone with him. A bag of licorice? I said no. Well, that was the right thing to do, wasn't it, Eva? Anyway, you're not interested in Harry Flite, are you, Eva? No. ♪ My sister will be your darling ♪ ♪ My sister will be your wife ♪ ♪ But only if you love her ♪ ♪ And give up your own life ♪ There.

Do you know where a Mr. Dian is? Yeah, mate. Through there. Thank you very much. What can I do for you, Harry? Well, come in, lad. I know him, don't I? Ho ho ho. Do you, now?

Come and have a look. Come on. It's Danny coming out of the shower. Eva... That is the most beautiful thing I have ever saw in my life. You see, if Mr. Dian gave me a job in your sawmill, I'd be able to look at him every day. Yeah, well, he's not gonna give you a job if you still read and write like one of Harry's pigs, is he? Let me look, let me look. Hey. What can you see? Who are you looking at? My Danny? Is Danny still there? No. Great. He must be coming out. Eva? What are you doing, Eva? Good evening, Mr. Dian. I'll see you tomorrow at work, then, Mr. Dian. Good night. Good night. You'd be better off taking it with you and wearing something else on the train. By the time you get there, it's going to be all crumpled up, isn't it? And don't forget your wireless. What's that? I said... don't forget your wireless. Got it. No, I mean, don't keep it in at the funeral. Are you sure you don't want to come? Have lots of family there. I thought you said you didn't want me to. When did I say that? I'll tell you who's going to be there. That poor cousin who lost his leg. Thought he was in Italy. No, no, he's been back for a while now. Months, I think. Which one was it? Michael? Joseph?

"like no man has ever loved a woman before." "He talks about her all the time. "And sometimes he shouts her name out "in the middle of the night, "and I can hear him from my own bedroom. "She loves him back, but she pretends she doesn't." "Women are like that." "They like to deceive men to make them stay with them." That's very good, Maria. What do you think, Eva? Did Harry write that for you? Of course not. Of course he did. Anyway... I've seen the way you look at him. How do I look at him? Like he was burning you... from the inside out. Back? I'm back. Well, what was it like? It rained. One of the pallbearers fell over. Was Joseph Lees there with only one leg? What? Well, what's he look like? Has he got a sweetheart? -Who? -Joseph Lees. Joseph Lees? Well, you must know. ...Yeah, I think he was there. Or was that his brother? For god's sake, Dad, can't you remember anything? Why, why is she pestering me, Janie? So, was he there? Joseph Lees? Why do you want to know about Joseph Lees for? Eva wants to know. Eva wants to know everything. - Just shut up, Janie. - For heaven's sake. You're not carrying a torch for him, are you, Eva? No. Of course I'm not. No, of course not. Much too sensible for that. Joseph Lees? Wouldn't that be embarrassing? Gob, I've upset her. You're looking the wrong way. Not my way at all. Run away with me. Where are you running? Well, where do you want to go? I want to go to... The mountains? Africa? Hey? Or the moon? Or my bed? My art class. But I might see you later. Sorry. Do not forget that this man who is sitting here is a solid form. He is not a thin thing to be sketched. Underneath his skin there is muscles and bones. The male form is different from the female form. The female form is like the female brain... soft and changeable. But the male form is a hard thing. It is hard in itself, and it is a hard thing to capture. Do you see, Eva? Bugger! Shit. Did Eva hit ya? Wish she had. Always get these damn things when I'm nervous. Do I smell of pigs? You smell of blood. Women like that, don't they? Can I come into the fight with you? 'Course you can't. Far too young. No, I'm not. -Yes, you are. -No, I'm not. -Yes, you are. -No, I'm not. Hello, Harry. You came. What are you doing here? I want to come, too. You can't. You're too young. Better go home to bed, okay? I'll see you later. What would you do if it was me going in the ring? I'd think you're a fool. If I was doing it for you? I'd still think you're a fool. So, when's it all gonna start then? I want to see some blood and gore. My God, Harry. Come here. No, I'm fine. -Come on, let me... -Please. I'm fine. Please. Listen, I'll be back in a minute, yeah? Go up closer, Eva. Go on. Go on. There's nothing like it. Go on, Danny! Come on! Go on! Go on! Excuse me, please. Please! Aah! Please! -Eva! Eva! -Harry! It's all right. Come on. You're all right now. Make way. Make way, please. So, can't I come in? There's no point. Dad and Janie are up.

No. My dear Eva, this is what I was trying to tell you about Italy. I probably didn't do it very well. The books and photographs will do it better.

Well, what's the book? It's about Italian art. Why do you want to know about that? Well, I might go to Italy one day. What for, work in a spaghetti factory? Don't be so stupid. Well, what else would I do there? Well, don't you want to talk to me now I come home? What do you want to talk about? Where'd you get it from, that book? My cousin. My second cousin. Eva... What?

No. You didn't mean that. You... meant jealous of someone else, didn't you? Didn't you? Who is it, Eva? Don't come near me. You tell me who it is! What are you doing? Don't come near me! Get away from me! Harry! Bastard! Brought your book back. I-I wiped the mud off, and I dried it out for you. It doesn't look too bad now. Look, I'm down on my knees to you, Eva. Please forgive me. I've never done anything to hurt you. You know that, don't you? You know that. It's just I'm scared, that's all. Please forgive me. I'm so sorry. Please. Please. I'd die if you didn't love me, Eva. I love you so much. Dear Cousin Joseph, it was nice to see you at the wedding the other day. My sister Eva would love to see you again. Perhaps you can come around for tea. Lots of love, Janie. You've always been clever at mending things. I remember my old dad. He used to be really clever with anything to do with wood. He was hopeless with metal things. Funny, that, isn't it? Eva. Are you handy with wood? Can't trust it. Changes too much after you've fixed it. Yeah, I suppose it does? Eva. What? Don't say "what," say "pardon." Pardon. Joseph Lees is at the door. Joseph Lees? What's he doing here, for God's sake? So, what are you doing here, Joseph? I'm just passing through. There was, um... somebody I had to see for work. Tell me, Joseph, is there much work to be had for a geography man? I'm a geologist. A geologist. You know, for a man... Well, you know, with your... In your... Sometimes, yeah. Yeah. Suppose it depends. How long is it since you saw Eva, her family? Where you going? I'm gonna get the sugar. It's already here, on the table. Where's your head, girl? You all right? Yeah. Was a good wedding, wasn't it, Joseph? It was lovely, yeah. How's Italy these days, Joseph? Joseph's a great one for Italy, Harry. Did you know that? No, I didn't know that. Did I see one of your postcards here the other day, Joseph? Um... That must have been one of yours. Somewhere in Italy or Greece or somewhere. You might have done. So, what are your plans, Joseph? Well, I'm going back to Italy soon. Good. That's good. Yeah. Going on your own? Suppose so. Well, then... Stop it! So... I'd-I'd better be going. I'll see you off. Thank you very much for the tea. My pleasure. I was going to tell you... You don't have to, tell me anything. I shouldn't have come. So you're going back to Italy, then? Next week. I'll be all right. Here you go. Dirty dogs. You dirty stinking filthy dogs! Where are you going? Eva? Nowhere. Just out. Get out, will you? Get out! Get out! Just get rid of them, Harry! Just get rid of them! Harry! Harry! Harry! Listen, I got rid of 'em for you. It's what you wanted, wasn't it? What are you doing? I'm leaving. No, you can't. You have to stay here with me. You can't leave me, Eva. You can't leave me. - What do you think... - I thought you'd take care of me! I thought you'd be different! I thought you weren't gonna be just like her, when she left him, and he's out there, and he's hanging, and she left him, and now it's gonna be you just the same as her! The same as who? My mother! She goes, he's crying all the time, and then he's hanging, and... I don't want to be like him, and I will be if you go. I will be! I'll be out there hanging! I won't be able to help it, 'cause I'm just like him! And I'm... -Harry! -I'll do it first, before you can go! Then you'll see! Harry, stop it! You'll see just like she saw! Harry! Stop it! I'm not going! Shh. Good. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. Cheer up, you old misery guts. You know where she is. You know what she's doing. You're driving me mad. You don't understand, do you? Well, of course I understand. You think I've never been in love before? Look, you should play the old push-me, pull-you. What's that? Well, you show her you care, and then you show her you don't care. Women love it. Do you love it? No... But I can't resist it. "Pour in the vinegar... "and bring to simmering point." He's back from Italy now. -Did you know? -Yeah. Are you gonna write back to him? There's nothing to say. Anyway, just stay out of my bloody business, will you? God. What are you cooking, cranes? - Chutney. ! I hate chutney. But I thought you liked chutney. No, no. You're all right, my love. Anyway, nice to see Harry's let you out for the night, Eva. Dear Eva, it's cold now that I've come back home. Perhaps I should have been away longer. But then there was nothing much to keep me there. I do hope things are well with you. I wouldn't like to think I've caused you any trouble. I don't know how you can just forget about him like that. You don't know what you're talking about, Janie. Aah! I wasn't meddling. I just want you to... To be happy. But I am happy, silly. Oy! Shh. Harry? Hey. What? How could you do that? Do-do what? Did you want me to know? Eva. Did you? Eva. For God's sake... Eva! Hello. Can I come in? Yeah. That's, um... malecite. From... Malecite. Malecite. Malecite. Malecite. That's stipnite. That comes from Romania. Very fragile. Tell me what was the best bit. The best bit... Was when you put your hand on the rock in the quarry. Up on the surface where the sun had been on it. It was warm. And you knew that it went down into the earth's crust. You're gonna dig it up. You're gonna cut it, grind it, shape it, take it away. But for that moment when you touched it, and you knew it was there as it had been for... millions of years, it was a good moment. I love the way the words just fall out of your mouth. You know, love. When I first woke up... after the operation... Not the times when I was drugged, I didn't know where I was then. I thought I was on the boat most of the time. A boat with a crowd of men from the quarry. I was counting the oars as they dipped into the water. There was always four strokes, never five. That's when I first woke up... And this most violent pain... just below my knee. And I was still counting. It's okay. It's okay. Five charges. There were only four. Exploded. I'm so sorry. Come here. Come here. You know when you came to our house... And Harry was there? Harry and me, it was just something that happened. I don't know why. I can't imagine you doing that without thinking about it. But I did think about it. Never been to heaven and back. That was why I wouldn't marry him. But you didn't mind sharing his house? Do you think that was a bad thing to do? If you want to go back for a while, I'll understand. I don't want to go back. If you're worrying about him, if you need to straighten things out. I don't want to go back. We can go away somewhere together, you and me. Italy. Get a nice apartment by the river. Marble bathroom. Windows open all night. Just us, like that? Yeah? Come here. I'm not coming. You've got to, Eva. It's the worst he's ever been. You can't just run away. He's really sick. Look, um, I'm coming with you, all right? I don't think you should. It'll kill him. Harry! Come on, Harry! You can't hide from us forever! Where do you think he might be? I don't know, do I? I haven't seen him since yesterday. I shouldn't have gone. Come on, my dear. Let's be hearing you. Harry! He's on the roof. My God, Harry, no! You'll be all right, sweetheart. We'll get you down. Eva. Harry. -Come on, Harry! -Eva's here. Harry, no! Harry! Harry. Harry! Watch where you're walking, Harry! Don't look down! Eva, for God's sake, you do something! Harry! -No! -Harry! Don't fall. Harry, please don't fall. Harry. It's all right, Harry. It's all right. Yeah. "Dear Joseph, "I will make him better. "I'll show him how to manage without me, "and then I'll come back to you. "It won't be like this forever, I promise you." Because I can't stay. You know I can't. -I have to get away. -You can't leave him again, Eva. Please, Maria. You have to help him to get better. I can't stay here forever. Eva! Eva! God, Harry. You must be freezing by now. No. I'm all right. You know, when you were with him... Did you think about me when you were with him? Did you? Harry, what's wrong? Thought you might be hungry. Here you go. Your favorite. Harry, listen, Mr. Dian and everything, you know? I know, but when I first saw you, I wanted to run up and give you a big kiss. Harry. You-You'd have thought I was a bit mad then, wouldn't you? Harry, look at me. Look at me. Listen, this is not the time to talk about this, okay? I've got to go back to work, and I'll talk to you later on, okay? You eat those up. I need to talk to you, okay? Harry? Promises are made to keep. Promises are made to reap. Make a promise, break a promise. Promises'll make you weep. She's not coming back, you know. She is back. Not in her heart. Not in her soul. What am I gonna do? Why do you think she went off with him? Don't know. Hey, mind! You all right, luv? I brought him some magazines to keep him busy. All right, Harry? Eva'll look after you. Won't you? He's gonna be skipping and sparring, my dear. Soon be mended. Soon be better. You shouldn't have come here. I haven't heard from you. You've got to go. But I need you to come with me. It's gone so wrong. Eva, who is it? I have to go. Eva, look... Eva. Eva. Do you need anything else, Harry? No. I'm all right. You're not going out today, are you? Are you? No. No, I'm not going anywhere.
