(cheering) As you know, I moved to Lisbon to... support my son David's passion for playing football. -(cheering) -Yes, Madame X is a soccer mom. However, at some point, I found myself a tiny bit lonely, a little bit depressed. -(chuckles softly) -MAN: No! The main reason was because I have no social life. -(man whoops) -I'm not sure why you're cheering about that. (laughter) Luckily for me, I had a friend-- one friend only-- who lived here. Her name is Victoria. She took me out. The first thing she took me to was a living room session. They don't have living room sessions anywhere else in the world, and I hope that you guys realize how amazing and unique this experience is, because we don't have this in America. People don't get together in people's homes and just play music and sing and recite poetry and paint paintings just for the love of art. It is so amazing and incredible to witness this. (cheering, applause) Am I talking too much? AUDIENCE: No! Let me ask you something, are there any gay people here tonight? -(laughs) -(cheering) Oh, my God. What's wrong with me? Anyway, so I met Dino d'Santiago. -(vocalizing) -And he took me-- yes-- he took me out to one fado club after the next. Not just fado but morna and coladeira and of course funaná, and then eventually batuque. -(cheering) -So... What a lucky human I am and I was. And you know, I've-I've traveled across the United States of America, trying to explain to everyone what fado means, but finally, I don't have to! (cheering) No, everyone here knows what fado means. (typewriter clicks, dings) (cheering, clamoring) While living here, I had the great privilege to meet -one of the most amazing fado singers that ever lived. -(fado song playing) Her name is Celeste Rodrigues. (cheers, applause) And she introduced me to her great-grandson, Gaspar Varela. (cheering) (music stops) Aw! You know this guy? -AUDIENCE: Yeah! -He's amazing. Did you bring me a beer? Thank you so much. (cheering, clamoring) Cheers. He's 16, so get that look off your face. (laughter, clamoring) Anyways, while we were rehearsing in Brooklyn, 18 hours a day, Gaspar challenged me to learn how to sing a fado song. I'm always up for a challenge.

Yeah. You're known for smoking on stage, and I'm know for masturbating on stage. It's, like, a known thing. -Right? Right? -Yeah! Honestly, this is no bullshit, I always tell Dave he's the next James Baldwin, but he refuses that title. Take it, motherfucker! We need someone. We need someone like you to look up to. Grab it by the balls. -You know what, Madonna? -(laughs) When I was younger, right, when I started my career, I had a poster of you on my bedroom wall. (cheering) No bullshit-- you, Salt-N-Peppa. Years ago, I was at Saturday Night Live backstage, and you were the musical guest. (cheering, whooping) And I knew a guy that-- knew a guy that gave me some tickets. And I saw you and Tupac walking backstage. I don't know what was going on that night, but you looked very worried about him. (laughing) (chuckles): Now, that's some wild shit. And the years went on, and I met you backstage at Amy Schumer's show. (cheering, whooping) And it was as if I had known you for a million years. Madonna, I believe in God. I believe that all humanity is from a single source. I thank God every day that he made me talented so I could get to meet people like you. -Yeah! -And talk to... -people like you. -(cheering) Madonna, these are terrible, terrible times, and you're making me so happy tonight.
