Heavenly Homecoming to Stars Directed by LEE Jang-ho You must have this injection for the next 10 days. Now, come this way please. - Lie on your stomach. - Is it gonna hurt? Yikes! I can't stand needles. Ouch. Ouch! Women could get you in trouble for sure. One more thing. Stay away from alcohol for the time being. Argh! That really hurts. A girl is weeping alone. Her slender shoulders are shaking As frosty moonbeams fall upon her. Her long hair sways in the moonlight. A girl is weeping alone, Covering her face with her hands. Chilly winds are blowing this way. Her long hair sobs in the winds. A girl is weeping alone. Her slender shoulders are shaking As frosty moonbeams fall upon her. Her long hair sways in the moonlight. A girl is weeping alone, Covering her face with her hands. Chilly winds are blowing this way. Her long hair sobs in the winds. - Hmm... - How is it? You may start drinking again. You should still be careful with women though. Really? - Pour me another. - Yes ma'am. There you go. That girl over there. What's her story? Well, I'm sure you know more about these things than I do, Mr. Kim. Is that so? I see. Please give her a drink from me and this painting too. Yes, sir. - What's this? - From that gentleman over there. But I don't know him. - Well, tell him I said thanks. - Okay. Welcome. Yes. Do come in. Hey lady. You look familiar. Oh really? There must be someone who looks a lot like me. Why don't you take a seat? I'm not allowed to sit down. It's against the rule. I'm getting bored drinking on my own. - What's your name? - I'm Kim Mi-young. That's a pretty name. - Would you like a drink? - I'm not allowed. - I'll get sacked for drinking on the job. - Really? - How about l get you a drink later at that place? - What place? Don't be coy. I even gave you a portrait of you I drew. You've caught me out. Small world. Now you know what I do for a living. What's wrong with that? Nothing, I guess. Men who ask me to meet them after work... Well, most of them have a hidden agenda. Listen to yourself. Are you calling me a dirty man? Who knows? How am I supposed to know what you're like? I vouch for myself. I guarantee you that I'm a good man. You're so silly, mister. - Have you been here for long? - Sure. I've been waiting for ages. I ran all the way here. And when I had to jaywalk the traffic police swore at me. I got a real scolding. I'm so out of breath. What can I get you to drink? - I'll have the usual. - Coming right up. - What do you think of my girlfriend? - What? Hey! - I'm surprised. Really surprised. - What are you talking about? The things you say! Look at all the money I've made today. This morning, I drew a fortune card, which promised good luck and free booze. - How's my fortune-telling skill? - Excellent. Here, let's have a drink. You must have way too much time on your hands. - It's written all over your face. - Yes, you're right. What do you do during the day Mi-young? Actually... I lied to you before. - My real name is Gyeong-ah. Oh Gyeong-ah - That figures. So, what do you do during the day Gyeong-ah? - I nap. - Me too. I nap all the time. What else do you do? I go to the movies, or go shopping sometimes. - On your own? - Of course. - I have no one to hang out with. - Good. Very good. Why don't we meet up during the day and spend time together, huh? Wait a minute. I bet you say this to all the girls you meet. Really? If you say so. Young-seok! Come over here! Quick! - This machine must be drunk. It's throwing up coins! - Fantastic! Okay! Now this time try putting in five. Three watermelons is jackpot. Good luck! Okay. Young-seok! Over here! Hurry! - Three! Three watermelons! - You hit the jackpot! I knew it! We did it! Oh, that feels great. We should stop while we're ahead. Let's cash it and go. Damn you stupid machine. I could have bought a house with all the money I blew on you. I have something to tell you. Out of the blue, I long to say this tonight. I will give you everything I have. This love fills my pounding heart. For you, there's nothing I wouldn't do. I'll catch the stars in the sky and put them in your hands. I have something for you. Suddenly, tonight You're supposed to close your eyes when you kiss. I have something for you. Yikes! That's cold! Get a grip! You seem like a really nice guy. So nice that you're likely to be taken advantage of day and night like me. I will give you everything I have. This love fills my pounding heart. - What time is your shift? - I start at 5:30. - Should we go see a movie? - I have a better idea. - We're going somewhere interesting. - Interesting? Diviner Shin-il You're extremely ill-fated. There's no way out. You get no support from parents. So young and already you've been with many men. How's that? Isn't it true? You have a tough life ahead of you. You'll never get married. Go to America. You might have better luck abroad. Stop crying, silly. You didn't really buy that, did you? Hush now. Come on. Let's go. It's true. Everything he said is true. Come. Let's go. Stop crying on the street. How about we head back to my place? Okay. I got it. I know what you do for a living. You are an artist. - What is that? - What are you staring at? What on earth do you do here? I eat, sleep, paint, wash my face and paint some more. And then l eat and sleep again. - Come have a seat. - Sounds like a great life. Wish I could make a living like that. How amazing. What's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that? I'm looking at your body. You have a gorgeous figure. I bet you say that to girls all the time. Only a playboy can say things like that without blushing. Is that so? I see. I'd like to paint a picture of you. Will you let me? Are you just using that as an excuse to seduce me? Maybe. Anyway, I want to paint you nude. No way! Why would I take my clothes off? Oh well, let's keep the clothes on then That sounds more like it. I'm gonna wash my face. The tears ruined my make-up. Oh my! Out! Close the door! Get out! What's all the fuss about? Oh dear. Just get out! What? Oh my. Hey! What are you doing? I'm gonna bite you. Ouch! Stop! What's going on here? Stop acting like a child. Go outside please. I will give you a kiss, alright? Okay. I will be outside Gyeong-ah I'm only trying to find somewhere comfortable for us to rest. When have I ever had the chance to talk to you all night? Everyday, it's the same coffee, the same film, the same streets on my way to and from work. I'm sick of it. Inn What on earth are you so afraid of? I don't bite! Hey! Gyeong-ah! Where are you going? Gyeong-ah! Gyeong-ah! Please, Young-seok. Let's wait until after we're married. You're not a woman, so you don't understand how I feel. You don't trust me at all, Gyeong-ah. That's because you don't love me. Alright, fine. That's the last place. Come with me or just go. Do whatever you want. Let me make it clear though. This is the last chance for us. I can always buy another woman with my money. Thank you. Why are you back? What are you here for? Go away! I don't want to see you ever again! Give me a drink. I feel like drinking. What? Such a silly girl. - Are you sure? - Of course I'm sure. Here you go. Pour me another. You shouldn't drink like that. Take it slowly. Another one please. Alright then. I'm feeling dizzy. Hey, this thing is stuck. This zipper on the back. Be careful. Don't break it. Pull it all the way up first and then try unzipping again. Gyeong-ah. I can't tell you how happy I am right now. Being with you makes me so happy. Don't laugh. How could you possibly laugh? I can't help it. Gyeong-ah! What's wrong? Gyeong-ah! Why are you doing this? Open the door. Hurry up and open the door. Come on. Just open the door now. - Please let me find happiness in life. - Gyeong-ah! What are you doing? You'll catch a cold. Please make him love me forever and never abandon me. Hey, I'm gonna break down the door. l mean it. I'm really gonna break down this door. Please open the door, Gyeong-ah. How do I look? - How is my make-up? - Beautiful. Your makeup looks flawless. I'm off now. - I had a good time today. - Wait. - When are we gonna see each other again? - What for? You're even worse than I thought. Don't act this way. You and me, we're the same kind of people. Come back tomorrow, huh? You promised to let me paint you. Be careful. You're ruining my make-up. So here we are in the end. I guess this is what always happens when a boy meets a girl. You're coming back for sure, aren't you? Yes? They look like tiny grains. Why do men have nipples? You don't even need them. I'll be back. I will. By the way, I don't even know your name. Kim. I'm Kim Mun-ho I will try not to forget. I am pretty bad with names though. Bye! Gyeong-ah? Hello. You rarely go out these days. I'm out of money and haven't heard from home for a while. As I expected. Here is the letter from home you've been waiting for. - Thank you. - Have a good day. - No pictures of her face, as we agreed. - Okay. Welcome, sir. Long time no see. - Get me Miss Kim. Kim Mi-young - She doesn't work here anymore. - She's quit? - Yes. - Shall I get you a different girl? - No thanks. Gyeong-ah? Is that you? Hello. Is that really you, Gyeong-ah? - What are you doing here? - I've been waiting for you. I've looked everywhere for you. You're here at last. Well, I've been waiting an awful long time for you to come back. Anyway, it's great to see you. Let's go inside. - I have a confession to make. - What is it? While I was waiting for you outside, I tried and tried to remember your name. But all l could recall was your surname, Kim. Unbelievable. My name is Mun-ho. Kim Mun-ho. That's it! Kim Mun-ho. Don't get offended though. We could pretend we've only just met for the first time. Let's start over, shall we? How do you do. My name is Oh Gyeong-ah. Pleased to meet you. I'm Kim Mun-ho. That's great. You seem like a really nice guy. - Do you want to be my boyfriend? - What? Yes, I'd like that. To tell you the truth, I got kicked out of my house. So I had nowhere to go and then I thought of you. Were you surprised to see me earlier? Not really. Right now I'm just so happy to be spending time with you. - Are you really going to stay here? - Of course. Until you kick me out. I will cook for you, do your laundry, and make you coffee when you're painting. I'm glad you're here. - Do you know how much I've missed you? - I've missed you too. - Oh, do you want to check out my luggage? - No, just leave it. I'll take my time and enjoy it for a long time. I'll undress myself. - You're playing cards so early in the morning. - I've been reading my fortune with cards. - I bet it says booze and noodles. - No, actually. We're likely to come into some money. If you're go out today, make sure you get a housing lottery ticket. You'll have good luck. Can you smell something burning? Hurry up and get ready. Get up and wash your face. Come on. Get moving. - Are we nearly done? - I need a bit longer. I'm bored out of my mind. And l really need to go to the toilet. Alright then. Let's have a break. - I know nothing. - Hurry up. I am frightened for no reason. Please don't say such things. - I have a favor to ask you. - A favor? - Can you bring me some tissue? - There's no more tissue. Then there's the calendar. Please bring me some soft calendar paper. Quick! Okay. Damn. Now even the calendar is nearly gone. - I'm going home for dinner! - Me too! I once knew a man who couldn't whistle. Please stop staring at me. Should I teach you how to whistle? This is how I whistle. Why don't you have a go? I... I'm tone deaf. Try again please. Was he your lover? The guy who couldn't whistle? He was. He's gone now. - Let's get back inside. I'm tired. - What's the matter? Who is he? Come. Let's go in quickly. It's none of your business. I don't want him to see us. - What's going on? - Nothing. - Who is that man? - Just forget it. How come you're so secretive? For a young woman, you have so many secrets. Please don't get mad at me. If you really want to know, I'll tell you. No, if it's a secret you wish to keep, I'd rather not pry. - I'm not forcing you to tell me anything. - I will tell you. I used to go out with him before l met you. You'll probably hate me for saying this but there's something weird about me. I can't survive a moment without a man by my side. Yes, I'm like that. That's what kind of woman I am. Don't be such a crybaby. It hurts. It's so painful. Does it hurt? I bet it does. But if l leave my mark on you like this, you'll never run away again. But each time, he found me soon enough. I came here to get away from him. I used you. That's the kind of woman l am. If you want me gone, I will leave. Stop talking nonsense. I wasn't always like this. Only if I'd married a good man, I would have had a beautiful baby by now, and I would have been happy. It's too late now. Too late. Welcome home sir. - Is everything in good shape? - Yes sir. Let me introduce you to our housekeeper. - How do you do. - Hello. - I look forward to working with you. - Yes ma'am. What are you staring at? That's a portrait of my deceased wife. She looks very much like you, doesn't she? Say hello to your stepmother, Myeong-hui. - Hello. - Hi. You must be tired from the trip. Hope you get a good rest. That's a good idea. I want to show you something. Here. This is amazing. I've had it newly decorated. A bedroom for you and me. Tell me. Tell me about your ex-wife. - Was she beautiful? - Very. Just like you. - Was she a good cook? - Yes. She made excellent side dishes and exceptionally pretty dumplings. - How about you? - I'm hopeless in the kitchen. I'm good at cooking instant noodles, though. But if you promise to love me from the bottom of your heart, I will learn to cook any dish you want, yes? I look forward to it. Oh my! What are you doing out here? Please don't bother yourself with all this. I can handle this myself. You're such an early bird. No, no. I've begun to enjoy housekeeping. I can't tell you how happy I am. But about Myeong-hui... Does she always shut herself up in her room like that? Tell me about it. She's like that all year round. And so peculiar too. She's only allowed to wear black clothes and black socks. Even in the middle of summer. He won't listen. Master can be so strange. You mean her father makes her dress that way? Don't even get me started. That's not the whole story. In that attic up on the top floor, He keeps everything Myeong-hui's mother left behind, including even her nightgown. Oh and that reminds me! Some time ago, when you two were on your honeymoon Myeong-hui's uncle paid a visit during his leave from the army. He said he was here to see Myeong-hui but things were rather fishy. Where were you? I stepped outside to get some fresh air. Go back to sleep. I thought you were asleep. The sound of the door woke me up. You look so much like Seon-hui. Identical. With the master away on business, what should we do? Don't worry. I should be able to take care of this. - Please keep Myeong-hui in her room. - Okay. - We'll stay right here and play. - Alright. How cruel. You look so much like my dead sister. That certainly proves that my brother-in-law directs his anger for his dead wife towards the child. Anger? Don't be surprised. My sister committed suicide in this very house. What? What did you just say? Poor thing. She killed herself. My brother-in-law had a delusional jealousy of his wife. He accused her of having a lover before marriage. He went as far as to deny Myeong-hui was his own. He didn't trust his own child and led his wife to kill herself. That's who he is. That must have been because of love. Maybe he loved her too much. Definitely not. That wasn't love. She died because of him and now he's haunted by her ghost. He's repeating the same tragedy with another woman who looks like her. What a two-faced lunatic. I'll leave Myeong-hui alone for now, but one day with your help, I'll take her away from this house. Goodbye. Mrs. Cheong-ju! - Yes, ma'am. - Please get me some porters. I'm gonna drive out the ghost of the dead woman. Yes. Over there please. So you're coming back on the 5 o'clock flight this evening? I'll prepare a delicious meal for you. Do hurry back home. I miss you like crazy. - Been keeping well? - Yes. How was work? Did everything go smoothly? Yes, it did. - Oh, I've prepared a bath for you. - Thank you. By the way, look in my suitcase. I'm not sure if it'll suit you. Oh. Wow! Look at this! Ha.. What do you think? It fits perfectly. - When did you clear out the room? - What are you talking about? When did you get rid of them? All the things in the attic. Yesterday. Who said you could do that? I don't need anyone's permission. I did it by myself. Shut up! You just have your own way with everything! This is a mess. You're defying me. What? When did I ever defy you? I said shut up! I hate it when people talk back to me. Why did you get rid of those things? Without even saying a word to me first. Don't you look away. Look me in the eye. How can I? My eyes are filled with tears. This may not be a big deal to you. But those things meant so much to me. Do you understand what I'm saying? I don't. I don't know who you are anymore. Just what have I done wrong? Everything is a mess now. What is it about Seon-hui that bothers you so much? And why? You're asking me why? Because I'm a living person. Look at me! I can talk. I can move my hands. I can sing. I don't even know how to put on makeup. I'm in love for the first time. I can run. Look. I can dance. I can drink alcohol. I'm not dead. Yet this house is filled with dead things. There's nothing cheerful here. I can't stand it anymore. - It's suffocating. - Are you finished? No not yet. You are a terrible man. You stifle me this way, and enjoy the whole situation as if you have nothing to do with it. You are not listening to a word I'm saying. I need someone who truly understands me. Is that all? No, there's more. But I won't tell you. What are you doing? I'm making a phone call. At this hour? Who are you calling? I need to talk to someone. Someone who gets me. How are you? Good. How's your boy? He's growing up so fast. Guess what. My dog has given birth to 12 puppies. Do you want to take one? Yes, please. Thank you. Gyeong-ah. You're out of your mind. You're drunk now. Let me take you to bed. Keep your hands off. Don't touch me. I'm not drunk. I can walk back on my own. Bam. I'm so sorry. I love you more than anyone else in the world. You really are such a beauty. Come on out sweetheart. Let us go welcome the moon. - We'll pick some cherries. - What's the matter with you? You're acting like a child. I'm not kidding. I'm serious. You could be a comedian. No, no. This is not a joke. I'm pregnant. Funny. You're having a baby already. - Are you pleased? - Pleased? Why of course. - The news has came so soon. - Yes, so soon. - Should I pour you a drink? - Why not? - My lips can be a small glass. - Sure. Such a pretty one too. By the way, how much do you know about being pregnant? Stop teasing me. I learned all about it in junior high school. Ma'am Don't be surprised. You're not pregnant. What? How.. Sometimes, when a woman longs for a baby so much, these symptoms appear. Some patients even pod up. Don't be so disappointed though. For a young woman like you, there's plenty of time to have a baby. Let me take you back to your husband. That's alright. Please tell him I'll wait outside. She is heartbroken. It was a false pregnancy. Do console her as best as you can. By the way, why did you pass up a good chance before? She had the operation, didn't she? Really? Are you saying my wife had an abortion? Let me go. - Please, I wanna get out of here. - I'll let you go. Only if you come clean and tell me everything. I'm your husband. I have the right to know. - Please. - Get out of my way. I'm tired of your tears now, Gyeong-ah. Please let me have a drink. Pour me another one please. I will tell you. I'll tell you everything. A girl is weeping alone. But I do love you more than anyone else in the world. Please put your arms around me. I'm so cold. It's getting unbearably cold. You. You're the only one love. Please believe me. No! Please! Yes, I've been deceitful but so have you. Your ex-wife took her own life. We suffer the same pain. Could we just forgive each other and move on please? I can always forgive you for what you did in the past But now I can't forgive myself. In that case, I'll take my things and go. The woman should be the one to leave. You can beat me up. Do whatever you want. But you must not leave. I'm terrified when you're not around. I won't survive without you. Please don't leave me. Excuse me. May I borrow a light? Thanks. - Are you Kim Mun-ho by any chance? - Yes I am. Why? Oh, nothing. Are you kidding me? Do you know how long you've kept me waiting? Sorry. - Is everything alright? - Yes. You're always drunk. I don't think I've ever seen you completely sober. Don't say that. Why are you so grumpy today? Hey. Stop it. Hyeok The tap is running. It's getting on my nerves. Turn it off please. - Just leave it. - No, I can't. It's distracting me. Are you happy now? I want you to clear up those plaster pieces now. Will you check if the door is locked properly? I know what's going on. I know why you're acting this way. I'm scared. I've been pretending not to notice but I'm scared. Scared. Oh Gyeong-ah? Yes, okay. Which police station? Pardon? Yes, I'll pass on the message. I'm dead tired. She says she was only out to get some sleeping pills. She could have frozen to death, wandering around the streets so drunk! My apologies. I'll keep an eye on her. - Take her home then. - Thank you. I have no family so when I die I want to be cremated. Will you scatter my ashes into a river on a snowy day? I really do not know. I know nothing. I am frightened for no reason. Please don't say such things. I know nothing about them. I've only heard of them before. No. I'll get it. - May I have a word with you, Mr. Kim? - Okay. - Who is it? - I'm popping outside for a bit. Excuse me, Mr. Kim Mun-ho. Sorry I had to ask you to come outside. Please forgive my rudeness. Here. Take a cigarette. We've just met but I must ask you for a favor. I'd like to talk to Gyeong-ah. - Who are you? - Me? How should I put it... Let's say I'm Gyeong-ah's previous owner. Well, before you took her from me. I don't know what you're talking about. You talk about her as if she is an object for sale. Oh, please don't take it the wrong way. I've never been good with words. Let me introduce myself. My name is Lee Dong-hyeok. I thought as much. Anyway, please let me see Gyeong-ah. - No. I can't. - What do you mean you can't? Now you listen Mr. Kim. I'm the one who tamed her. She's probably missing me right now. Mister! Mister, where are you? Why didn't you invite your friend inside? Long time no see. - Go away. - Are you talking to me? You can't talk to me like that. It's really over between us. Just leave. Gyeong-ah. I'm here to save you. Run upstairs and get your toothbrush. I'll wait right here. What are you doing out here? Let's get back inside. There's nothing left to say. You make a handsome pair. I'll leave you alone for now. But next time, I won't leave without you. You hear? Mark my words. - I hear you've quit drinking. - That's right. It's been almost a year. It must be difficult to stay off that good stuff. I've decided to devote myself to teaching. - Hello, Mr. Kim. - What brings you here? I'm busy. Besides, I have no time to spare on the likes of you. I'm aware of that, Mr. Kim. Well, I'm a busy man too. I'll just be honest with you. I've come here today because I'd like to return Gyeong-ah. How does that sound? She's grown quite weak. But if you're still alone, how about you take her back and live together? Truth be told, I'm fed up, Mr. Kim. To tackle her drinking problems, I tried beating her and even had her locked up in a rehab once or twice. Poor thing. For an ignorant fellow like me, things don't usually work out as I wish. I have no choice but to entrust Gyeong-ah to the care of someone as smart and well-educated as you. Please go see her. Soon, I'm boarding a ship and sailing somewhere far away. I've come to see you before my journey begins. - You're 25 this year, aren't you? - Dunno. Maybe. I see. You're only 25 years old. I'm leaving Seoul. I can't stand this city anymore. It's something I've been considering for quite some time. I can't even paint here. More than anything, I'm tired. I feel nervous and agitated all the time. My only consolation is that somewhere in the city, I got to meet you, Gyeong-ah, a childlike soul like me. I have nothing left. I know. I know what you're trying to say. You'll get nowhere with a woman like me. I could comfort people for a while. But then one by one they all abandon me. I've realized that everyone is alone in the end. That much I know. Turn your head this way. I want to see your face. My face doesn't look the same. I withered over the winter. Goodbye, mister. How did you know where to find me? - He told me. - He's gone. He left me too. - I know. - It's the last night of the year. Tomorrow is New Year's Day. - I look different, don't I? I've become ugly. - Not at all. - You're still very pretty. - You're still a good liar. Are you married? You're the same. You haven't changed at all - Go home. It's getting late. - I don't need to go back. But it's New Year's Day. You should be somewhere special. I want to spend it with you. Do you still have the girl with curly hair? You hair is wet. Dry yourself with this. - I'll cook some noodles for you. - No thanks. I'm not hungry. - Would you like a drink then? - No. - I'd rather lie down now. - I'll prepare the mattress. - It's been a while since we lay side by side like this. - I'm so happy. Please hold me closer in your arms. Women are strange creatures. Men decide for us what's right or wrong. There was a time when I was married and believed I was happy. The past is only a dream. It was a wonderful dream. All those who came into my life... I'd prefer to hold them dear. The shadows of their love and sorrow are engraved somewhere in my flesh. I wonder how they're doing. You're the only one left here. They're probably all happy somewhere. Drinking, falling in love and getting married. A few days ago, I posted a letter to my mom. But it was returned today. Apparently, there's no such person. You never talked about your mother before. You're right. I forgot about her for so long. Tomorrow or the day after, I'll go look for my mom. I miss her. - Will I be able to find her? - Of course you will. I'm so sleepy right now. Go to sleep. I'll be here watching over you. So many people disappear without a trace when morning comes. They have to leave. When morning comes, you'll abandon me too. I will. Now, go to sleep. Eatery May I join you? Let's have a drink together. - Are you waiting for anyone? - I'm meeting someone here. Who? Your lover? - No. - Your husband? - No. - Who then? I don't know. I don't know who I'm waiting for. I happen to be here by myself too. It's pretty late. Why don't you come with me? - He said he'd come so I'll wait. - What a stubborn lady. I really do not know. I know nothing. I am frightened for no reason. Please don't say such things. I know nothing about them. You've caught a cold. I've only heard of them before. My heart starts pounding. Please don't say such things. I'm still very young. Only 19 years old. I don't even know how to put on makeup. I'm in love for the first time. I don't know what's going on. Don't come any closer. Please keep your distance. I'm blushing. I'm still very young. Only 19 years old. I don't even know how to put on makeup. I'm in love for the first time. My mom will be angry. But I do wish to hear about this thing called love. I'm not wholly against it. Gyeong-ah! Why did I have to take sleeping pills? - Should I pour you a drink? - Why not? - My lips can be a small glass. - Sure. Such a pretty one too. Listen to yourself. Are you calling me a dirty man? Who knows? How am I supposed to know what you're like? I vouch for myself. I guarantee you that I'm a good man. You're so silly, mister. I mustn't fall asleep out here. I'll get up. Up. No. No. - Have you lost someone? - A woman is dead. - I see. Your lover has died. - Yes, that's right. Goodbye, Gyeong-ah.
