MY COUSIN FROM WARSAW Just as I suspected. Doctor? Just as I suspected. There's nothing I can do. Tell the truth, Doctor. Am I really sick? Sick? Am I a goner? There's nothing wrong with you. What? Is that why you look so glum? Indeed. It's a matter of viewpoint. Put yourself in my shoes. What a cynic! What is your profession? - Banker. - A fine profession. It depends. You probably you know my bank, Archibald Burel and Co. Of course! - Are you Mr. Archibald or Mr. Burel? - Both. Archibald is my first name. I'm Archibald Burel. Mr. Burel, you're tired, that's all. You need rest. Leave Paris and take a five-month country break. I'll be bored to death. Not if you follow my treatment. I'll write you a prescription. Can you handle mineral water? I think so. Each morning, one glass on an empty stomach. Fine. Each afternoon, a long walk, with an empty mind. I'll underline that. It's essential. “With an empty mind.” That's easy for me. To prevent boredom, every evening, before dinner, write four to five pages of an imaginary story. - A novel? - Or a play. Why not an opera? Are you a musician? Since I was seven, I'd play my pen quill like a harp. Speaking of which, listen to this. Octave. Mother, the boats on the water Do they have legs? Of course, silly goose If they didn't, they wouldn't move - Hubert? - Yes, dear Lucienne? Can I ask you something? Go ahead. We're in Saumur. Why do you only paint seascapes? That's all art dealers will buy. If they'd buy something other than seascapes, I'd paint something else. A song is enough to inspire you? Exactly. At least I don't get distracted by the landscape. It needs another eight inches. Perfect. I'll have it in two months. Idiot. - Do the finale at a gallop! - But, sir, we've arrived. Once more around the lawn. Go on. - Why, it's Archibald! - On Thursday? He never comes during the week. What's going on? - Ask him. - And give him a warm welcome. You're right. It's only polite. Ramarana Here he is! Ramarana - Are you crazy? - No. - But I'm very sick. - No. Yes. That's why I need to compose an opera. I'll explain. You can go. I had an appointment with Dr. Varron. - Rosalie! - What now? What did Rosalie do? - Mr. Burel just arrived from Paris. - That old bore? Watch that thing! “Old bore”? I forbid you to call Mr. Burel that. - I'll say what I please. - No. - Yes. - No. Yes. I'll prove it by telling you, “Go to —” “Helpful advice, doctor. How much?” “1,000 francs.” “Thanks.” Then I went to the bank, put Michel in charge, and caught the first train to Saumur. This is how, my dear friends, I've come to spend the whole summer with you. If you don't mind. Don't be silly! We're overjoyed. I'm delighted. Literally delighted. - Before, we never saw you. I was all alone. - Thanks a lot. I mean, without my friend Archibald. Now, at least, we'll have you. ...to the core! To the cabbage core, which I must save for the rabbits. I've never met a more annoying man than Mr. Burel. What about Mr. Hubert? Mr. Hubert? - I forbid you to... - Joseph! Coming! Here we go! What joy! What joy. We're stuck with him for three or four months. His conversation, his whims, his opera... You can bet he'll sing it for us. Darling. Calm down. I can't bear not having you all to myself. Archibald is my husband. - It's nothing to be proud of. - Hubert! The three of us will share our walks, our dinner, our love. Threesomes have always disgusted me. You should've gotten married. It doesn't protect you from threesomes. Quite the contrary. So it's true, Joseph, everyone is glad to see me? I'm glad to see you. What others think is none of my business. - Which others? - I was just saying. - You said it with someone in mind. - Of course. Now that you're here, you'll give the orders. You and your wife. No one else. It's more respectable. Who was giving the orders while I was away? - Mr. Hubert? - Yes, since you already know. For two months, Mr. Hubert has been giving orders. He acts like it's his house. It's his house, I know that. But still, to impose himself on us for four months straight... Am I intruding? Of course not, buddy. Just the opposite. - Sit down. - Thanks. - Port? - No. - Cocktail? - No, thanks. - Cigarette? - No! - Do you want — - You're very kind, but I feel like you're the host, and since this is my house, it's quite disorienting. What are you saying? It's very kind of Hubert to make himself useful. Sure. Lovely weather. Yes. I hope it lasts. Lovely weather. Yes. And it's lasting. Get ready, kids, I'll play you the opening of my opera! Let's hear it. Debauchery in Singapore. Lyrics and music by Archibald Burel. What's it about? The curtain rises, and the Hindu Ramarana, arriving from Singapore, catches his wife, the lovely Sita, with Lord Gregory, English army captain. Listen to this. Halt, halt, halt! Rama, Rana, Ramarana Halt, halt, halt! Ramarana is here Ramarana Ramarana Here he is Ramarana Bravo. What do you think? Very original. - Open the piano! - No. Open this piano! Hubert, give me that key! Or else, I'm warning you, you'll never hear the rest of my opera. Finally, some good news. Hubert has really become impossible. Every day, he's grumpier. He's ruining my summer. - Don't exaggerate. - I'm not! What's more, I find his attitude suspicious. Just listen to yourself! You can't truly believe I'm Hubert's mistress? No! I know you're not his mistress. I'm saying that Hubert acts like he were your lover. Archie. He's back. Joseph, bring my hat. - Isn't he cute? - What? - Since when do you foxhunt? - I'm not. Then what's the horn for? My personal satisfaction. I enjoy the sound of the horn. Just because I can't ride doesn't mean I'm not allowed a fox horn. Play, my friend, play. You're just jealous. No, no, no. I won't stand for this. The horn? No. The constant constraint. - Good Lord, I love you! - I love you too. Silly goose, you know I'm faithful to you. Yes, but I love you passionately, jealously, exclusively. I was used to having you whenever I wished. Last summer you were alone, I was alone at my house, and Archibald spent a total of eight days here the whole summer. That was bearable. Now he's here all the time, every single day! It's not my fault. How can we get rid of him? Ivan! Boris! Toby! I can't believe it! It's Sonia! - Sonia? - My cousin from Warsaw. Hello! Sonia! Yes, it's me, Sonia. How are you, dear? I got lipstick on you! I have so much to tell you. - Where did you come from? - Dinard. I'm driving to San Sebastián. - Have you had lunch? - Not yet. - What? - It's Russian. I was praising God. I was terrified you'd already finished! - Let me introduce you to Hubert. - Later. Tell me, what's the best hotel in town? - La Cloche. - Great. I'll send my beau there. I'd like him to stay, but he's so sad! Always crying. Toby, have lunch at La Cloche and come back for me at 3:00. Now introduce me to this gentleman. Hubert Carteret, painter specializing in seascapes and dear friend. Nice to meet you. I knew a painter in Palermo. He also had a specialty. He only painted Mount Etna's eruptions so he hardly ever worked! He had gorgeous leopard eyes that saw into one's soul. You also have lovely eyes. You have much to tell me? What? Yes, so much, but where to start? - First, I'm engaged. - No! Isn't that pretty? - Did he give it to you? - No, no. - You like each other, don't you? - Sonia! It's none of my business. Sonia. What did I tell you? He's always weeping. Off to lunch with you! I'm getting married and bringing honor to the family. Driver, take me to La Cloche. I'm marrying Marquis José Torres de Cortés of Spain, first cousin to the king, who always wears a big hat at important ceremonies. He's very handsome, very noble, and very poor. Right now, he's in prison. - Is he a thief? - No way! He's a plotter. What? A plotter. He plots. He meets in cellars with masked men who carry torches to discuss assassinating the king. It's very interesting. And so? So, I must go to San Sebastián to intercede for my fiancé with Alfonso XIII, whom I know very well. I met him years ago in Granada at a bull run. We had tea together afterwards. I'll ask him to release my fiancé. I'm sure he'll accept because the marquis is quite harmless. - Harmless? - Of course. He'll be very happy with a few weeks in prison. He'll never plot again. It's because he's 50 years old and had never been imprisoned before. Poor marquis. He's so silly, it's noble. I adore him. - By the way, how is your husband? - Unwell. He quit his bank. Now he writes Hindu operas. Hindu operas? Oh, my! Poor cousin! He's been here for the last two weeks. - Sonia? - Yes, dear. - Can't you stay for a few days? - No. - Just a few days. - No, that's impossible due to Alfonso. - Alfonso? - The king of Spain. He can wait! Come in. Take off your hat. I need to talk to you. You do? I adore her. - See you later, painter. - Quite soon. A short visit is a great idea! I'm exhausted. I've been driving since morning. Your lover is so kind! - Who are you talking about? - The painter. My lover? You're crazy! Go on, admit it. You love him, don't you? - Yes, I do. - I told you. I really love him. I can't be coy when I'm about to ask you for a favor. A favor? How much? In dollars or francs? Not money! What's that? It's Archibald, hunting. Well, dear? Listen, Sonia, I'd like you to keep my husband busy. What? Good idea. Does he know how to drive? - Why? - I'll hire him as a driver. He isn't looking for a job. Just tell me what you want. Listen, Sonia, you're an incredible seductress. - Stop it. - It's true. No man can resist you. - My husband is in the way. - What? Distract him so we have some freedom. - Make him fall in love with you. - With me? That's the most amusing idea! Let me kiss you, you deserve it. - But I can't. - Why not? Your husband isn't very handsome. He doesn't attract me. If he did, I'd be doing you a favor, not asking you to do me a favor. I'm begging you. - Sonia. - Darling. - You can't refuse me a favor. - No, because you're so kind. And it will be so amusing! I accept. You're wonderful. Thank you. Come here! The owner of the car is in here! Open the door! Pay us! Pay us! Pay us! Pay us! Pay us, pay us, pay us, pay us Pay us, pay us, pay us, pay us Go on, pay us! Quiet, everybody! Let's go. I have money for everyone. How about that? My cousin from Warsaw! I should've known! I'll be right there, Cousin. Congratulations, Cousin, you got more game than I. Hello, my dear little cousin! Put that stuff down first! What's this I hear? You're sick and writing Hindu operas? How fascinating! You must play me your opera, unless you're still mad at me? On the contrary, Cousin, I'd be delighted. Delighted? Isn't he sweet? We'll work on it together. After lunch, if you don't mind. I don't mind, I could eat a horse! Good for you! No need to be shy. Enjoy! Archie has found an audience. Poor audience. Love is a wonderful thing Like a sweet fairy ring Falling in love Is sweet It's so very sweet Falling, falling, falling Love is so very sweet - You have talent, Cousin. - I agree. - You must stage your opera. - I agree. I'm in final negotiations with Roucher, the director of the opera. - Reserve me a box for opening night. - Of course. - It will be a hit, Cousin, a triumph! - You really think so? You're so pretty, Cousin. You've never been so attractive. I wish I could say the same for you! - What? - Nothing. What do you think of my cousin from Warsaw? She's original, odd, interesting. Now you see how she's turned the heads of so many men from such varied ranks and stations. It's quite clear. Once she's decided to charm a man... It mustn't be hard for you to make a man fall in love with you. - Do you think so? - I'm sure of it. Even a man with many other passions. Be more precise. It's like you have a proposal. - That's true. - True? This is moving too fast. Since you permit it, I'll open my heart to you. Too easy. It's no fun at all. Cousin, what if I asked you for a favor? Would you accept a man who until now has not declared his love for you, who hasn't given any sign he's noticed you? I'm not saying no, Cousin, but it depends on the man. - Obviously. - Obviously. Our friend Hubert Carteret, the painter, lives near here. Yes? Recently, I've come to suspect that Hubert is in love with Lucienne. - You think Hubert is Lucienne's lover? - Not at all! - That's good. - If he were, you'd be too late. - However, you're just in time. - What? - You understand me, don't you? - No. You must seduce Hubert Carteret. What? Now you're asking me to... How about that! Yes! You must distract him from his guilty desires and make him fall in love with you. What a funny favor for you to ask me! Does it bother you? No, I like it. Do you accept? Well, I'll answer you tonight. Did you two have a nice chat? We understand each other perfectly, don't we? Yes, Cousin. I'm not leaving. I have too much to do here. Right, my friends? Heads, Archie. Tails, Hubert. Hubert won. What does that mean? It means, silly Englishman, that Lucienne asked me to make her husband fall in love with me and her husband begged me to flirt with his wife's lover! What a family! Be quiet. It's a Cornelian situation. In England, we'd call it Shakespearean. Same thing. So I decided with a coin toss. - And Hubert won. - For today. I'll toss again tomorrow. I'm sure Hubert will win again tomorrow. That's nice of you. I adore you. - Hello, Cousin. - Hello, Cousin. - Where are you going? - To see my beau. - Beau? - The painter. Hubert? - You're in quite a hurry. - I'm just following orders. Don't worry, I'll do my best. See you later, Cousin. - Good morning. - Did you sleep well? - Yes, how about you? - Fine. What's new? I tried to flirt with your husband, but he's not very receptive. - You have to warm him up. - What? Talk me up, get him interested in me. The things you make me do! Who, me? That's rich, coming from you. You're right. Thanks again. - Thanks, darling. - See you later. See you later. You again? Listen, Sonia, I need to talk to you. I have an errand for you in my room. I lost a pearl from my necklace. It must be under the bed. Go find it. Listen, Sonia... - You don't look happy. - No. No. Here. Now you can go. Idiot. Good morning, painter. Good morning, traveler. - I've come to visit you. - Come in. It's lovely, so very lovely! - Kind of you to visit. - I'm very kind. You were right to come. We have lots of things to say to each other. Since you've arrived, we've never had a minute alone. - It can't continue. - Why not? - It seems to me... - It seems to you? Let's get it out in the open. Let's speak our mind. Who shall start? You. I'd like to know why, rushing through Saumur to rescue a martyred revolutionary from prison, you suddenly decided to stop here for an open-ended visit? My cousin knew exactly how to keep me here. Really? Which cousin? Might you be jealous? I don't know. - What if I were? - Come on! Goodness! I'm unattached, young, handsome, a painter. I have the right to be moved by your grace and beauty and your strange, perverse charm. Are you courting me? - What if I were? - You men! What? - Since you're unattached — - Young, handsome, and a painter. Young? Yes. Handsome? Yes. Painter? I couldn't say. But unattached? No. Me? It's come to my attention that you're Lucienne's lover. Infamy, lies, and abomination! - Who told you that? - She did. - She told you? - Yes. She told me you sleep together very often. - Is everything okay? - Fine. I think I've got the next act of my opera. Yes. Arriving in Singapore, a young Chinese princess is followed by a young Japanese man, Atakyoto. That's great. The princess comes to stay with Ramarana, who looks at her longingly and sings, listen to this: Ooh-la-me-too O my blonde Chinese girl - Your Chinese girl is blonde? - Yes. - And her name is Ooh-la-me-too? - Why not? It sounds very Japanese. Lucienne loves you, yet you want to be my lover? As you say in French, you've got some nerve! When I first saw you, Sonia, I was overcome with passion. What I feel is so serious, so haunting. What is “haunting”? - Deep, durable, romantic. - You're such a painter. - You're such a Muscovite. - What do you mean? Cold, Moscow. Brr! - The steppes. You're a steppe. - Me? You should already be in my arms. - You think so? - Don't you? I'm still hesitating, which might be a mistake because... - Because you find me attractive? - No. - Because I excite you? - No. No, because I've been told to take you as a lover. No. What clairvoyant, loyal friend suggested that? What is “clairvoyant”? Charming, witty, romantic. My cousin. - Archie? - Yes. How nice of him! But why? Not to be nice, but because he fears you're Lucienne's lover. Infamy, lies, and abomination! That's what I told him: Infamy, lies, and... - Abomination. - Abomination. What will happen to your blonde Chinese princess? I don't know. I never know what my characters will do next. - You're kidding! - They show me the way. Writers usually think up their stories ahead of time. - I think them up afterwards. - No! Only one thing would bother me: if the princess fell in love with Lord Gregory. That would bother me too. It'd bother everyone. It's a stupid plot twist that would please no one. I agree. Your princess can only be loved by Ramarana. You're right! I have to convince the princess to concentrate on Ramarana. - I'll take care of it. - What? I mean, I'll think it over, very seriously. What you've just told me is very upsetting. - He has suspicions? - No, simply worried. Why? Did he find a letter? One of my shirts in with his? My footprints in his wife's bed? It's just a doubt, clairvoyant and haunting. How about that! - You're upset? - Certainly. Have you forgotten your passion for me? It's redoubled! First because you're exquisite, and second, it'd make Archie happy. - Take me, Sonia. - What? Two of us are for it. We'd be doing Lucienne a favor. - Lucienne? - Naturally! If you're my mistress, Archie won't suspect a thing. You have a talent for explaining things. Like a cat, you always land on your feet. - Cats are sweet. - Yes, they're sweet and soft. They scratch. They're cruel and... haunting. - I love them so much. - Yes, Sonia. I'm about to make another mistake. I've made so many, I've lost track. And you call me cold and Muscovite? You're adorable. Give me your lips. Of course, because you're sweet and because... There's my cousin. Won't he be pleased! - For your throat. - No, thanks, I don't have a cold. Buddy, what are you doing here? Visiting. Congratulations, Cousin. You don't waste time. - You asked me to! - Still, you don't waste time. You're free to do as you wish. I certainly am! - And you're haunting! - What? She likes that word. You'd better go see my wife. She's all alone at home. I can't. I'm showing Sonia my paintings. You can show them another time. I don't know if... Go on, Lucienne is waiting. Well, if she's waiting for me... Wipe off your mouth. - Excuse me, Sonia. - Go ahead. - So, Cousin. Pleased? - With what? Did you see how I kissed that painter? I saw that. It's important to me to please you, Cousin. - What? - Nothing. It doesn't really please me. You told me to charm the painter! - I made a mistake! - You don't know what you want. I do. You! - What? - Cousin, I can hide it no longer. Sonia, delightful Sonia, I adore you! What's wrong? You treat me shamefully. You shouldn't entertain Sonia when I'm not there. You threw me at the painter, so too bad for you! I started with him and I'm very inflammatory. - You're like that? - I am. Leave me alone! Sonia, let me kiss you. Leave me alone! What are you doing here? I'm still looking for the pearl you dropped. Liar! Get out of here! What is that guy doing here? What are you doing here? If anyone asks, say you don't know. I can guess. - Any objections? - None. You're unattached. Indeed. Are you really unattached? No. No? You have a mistress? - Didn't you suspect as much? - Well... You never wondered what I was doing here all alone for months? Yes, I did wonder! Yes, after all. You have a mistress. If it's a secret, she must be married. Naturally. How about that! What about her husband? Tell me about him. - I'd rather not. - Scared? No, he's just not interesting. He's an idiot and a bore. - Your mistress's husband? - Yes. - He's a... - Yes. Then it's not me. Hold on, did you think that I... No. Just that you love, desire, long for... - Lucienne? - Yes. Infamy, lies, and abomination! So, you're the lover of another. - Indeed. - Then why do you stay here? Because I like you and you're my friend. - And the other guy is an idiot? - Right. They go back to Paris after summer? - Who? - The idiot and his wife. Of course, that's where I go too. Hold on. Parisians who summer in Saumur with a stupid husband... - It must be Gorgerot. - No names, buddy! Don't be embarrassed. You're Mrs. Gorgerot's lover. Come now. Hubert, my friend, it doesn't make you less of a wolf. And what a wolf! You're Mrs. Gorgerot's lover and I catch you kissing Sonia. You're revolting! If I ever catch you with Sonia again, I'll tell Lucienne. Why Lucienne? She's a close friend of Mrs. Gorgerot. You can bet she'll tell her. Come on, buddy, don't tell Lucienne! That's up to you. I'll be watching. Excuse me for being suspicious. Don't worry about it. Infamy, lies, and abomination. Gorgerot, that idiot! Oh, no. Hello. Where's Sonia? Is that all you can say? Not even a kiss for me. “Sonia, Sonia, where is Sonia?” What has she done to you all? All I ever hear around here is “Sonia.” - She's turned all your heads. - Don't exaggerate. I know what I'm saying. It's normal to find her attractive, but don't lose your head. Here we are, Cousin, just the two of us, all by our lonesome. Why don't you believe I adore you? Your declarations are so violent, Cousin. You've charmed me, shaken me up! And I'm bruised! Andrei, slow down! The wings of my desire fly too near the fire of your eyes. Very pretty. Be sure to use that in your opera. What is it, Cousin? Go on. You're so eloquent. Tell me. Suddenly, I don't feel so good. I've had it! Me too. - This will end badly. - It will end, that's all. - Immediately. - This instant. - Farewell. - Farewell. Forever. No. What? Stay. Let me kiss you, Cousin. Let me kiss you. 75 MPH Please, Cousin, not so fast. We're not in any hurry. Andrei, not so fast! That's better. I swear to you, Hubert is no good for you. In fact, there's no need for you to charm him. Why not? He told me he's the lover of a married woman whose husband is an idiot. Are you sure? I can't tell you his name due to my natural discretion. But I immediately guessed who it was. Who? Tell me. - Hubert himself told me... - Hubert himself. ...that he's the lover of a certain Mrs. G. Well, well. Just how many mistresses does Hubert have? - Who else do you mean? - No one. Head home, Andrei. I'm also discreet. I wouldn't have left. I wouldn't have let you. Darling. My love. It's them. - Who? - Archibald and Sonia. - Good Lord. - They can't find me here. I'll hurry home. - Where is my wife? - Out with Hubert. - That's great! - Great. This is more suitable for romance than the car! Very true. Let's talk about love. Just a few words: Give me your lips! Not so fast, Cousin. Perfect. Caught! Aren't these roses pretty? Very pretty. Don't be so emotional. It's incredible how lovely flowers affect him! I'm not affected. Lucienne, let me explain. What? - A ladybird... - A what? A ladybug flew into our cousin's hair then fell down her shirt. She was upset. When you came in, I was attempting, on her request, to remove it. That was kind of you. But why tell me? I thought... I thought you'd seen... Plus, he's dumb! You thought I'd seen what? Nothing, nothing. Thank you. You seem merry this morning. Yes, I'm very merry. Can I know why? I've just finished the first act of my opera and I'm delighted with it. There's something we should do together. - What? - A reading of my first act. You won't get the full effect if I just play it on the piano. If each of you sing a role, I'd have a better idea of the quality of my ideas. - It's an idea. - Yes, it is. Let's work this out. Casting. Sita is Lucienne. Lord Gregory is Hubert. For the role of Kali, I thought of Joseph. And Balou, Rosalie. Obviously, I'll play Ramarana. Certainly. So... Kali: Joseph. Balou: Rosalie. Ramarana: Burel. Ready, everyone? Yes! Here we go! As the curtain rises, Sita and Lord Gregory sing to the gods of love under the tender regard of the nursemaid, Balou. Let's go! O Gregory O my handsome Captain This romantic rendezvous Is perilous for you May the gods of love watch over us Tighten once more These tender chains O Great Saramatou Watch over us - And then — - Hold on, Cousin. Is she supposed to be kissing the captain? - Obviously! - Obviously. Don't interrupt, Cousin, please! Don't interrupt! I understand. Don't get so upset. Then, followed by the faithful Kali, enters Ramarana, husband of the sweet Sita. Yes, it's me It's me, the prince Atakyoto Atakyoto What's wrong with you? I sing there, not you! Halt, halt, halt! Rama, Rana, Ramarana Halt, halt, halt! Ramarana is here Ramarana Ramarana Here he is One, two! Ramarana May sir forgive me But I'm convinced The lady of the household Has made you a cuck — Bravo! Those aren't the words! I wrote: “The priests have taught that if a stranger touches the queen, - his throat must be cut!” - Good! Let's keep going. Fine. We'll keep going. Into this dramatic situation arrives the Chinese princess, Ooh-la-me-too. Go on, Cousin, it's your turn! Go on! While a vain hussy Makes a fool Of her hubby And her cousin Your opera I've had it up to here His opera We've had it up to here Yes, up to here Come on, kids, that's not it at all! Not you too? Those weren't my lyrics. What do words matter? It's all about music. Let's keep going. Okay. The lovely Ooh-la-me-too, seduced by Ramarana's virile charm... offers herself to him with a long kiss. Kiss me, Cousin. - I have to kiss you? - Kiss me. Yes, dear, kiss him. - Go on. - I understand. Here. O divine joy O divine joy - What's that all about? - What? - That kiss. - That wasn't the first! Mrs. Burel asked Sonia to flirt with her husband so he'd leave you two alone. O divine joy O divine joy Bravo, Sonia! This is great for me and Hubert. I'm glad. I just have to fall in love with your husband. - Bravo, Madame. - What's wrong? - I know everything. - What? You made a fool of me. I don't appreciate that. You're all driving me nuts with your dramas. Farewell! I'm leaving. - Please, think it over. - I've thought it over. I'll pack my bags immediately. Tonight I'll sleep in Bordeaux at Hotel Paris. Tomorrow I'll be in San Sebastián. The next day, I'll be married. All your personal affairs disgust me! I'm blowing this joint, as you say in French. O divine joy - She's right. - I did it up for us, so we could be together. I don't like setups. I'm honest, loyal, and pure. - I prefer to leave. - Hubert! What? Where is everybody? Where are you? Where did you all go? What's the meaning of this? It was going so well. - Where is Sonia? - She's leaving. - What? - Yes, she's packing. Packing? - Where's she going? - Spain. She'll sleep in Bordeaux tonight at Hotel Paris. What awful news! What could have happened? She refused to tell me. Why in the world is she leaving? I think I've guessed. Sonia is falling in love. That scares her, so she runs away. - In love? - Yes. - With whom? - I don't know. Then what makes you think that? Yesterday, when you came back from your car ride, she was in such a state, as if she'd just left someone who'd turned her world upside down. Good Lord! - What's wrong? - Nothing. I'm listening, Lucienne. It must be true. Sonia feels love swelling inside her, that scares her, so she runs away. She's mistaken. I doubt she'll escape. What do you mean? A man who loves her would never let her leave. He'll catch up with her. Tonight, he'll be in Bordeaux at Hotel Paris. In Bordeaux! Hotel Paris! HOTEL PARIS - Sonia Varilovna. - Excuse me? Has Sonia Varilovna arrived? She's blonde, elegant, haunting, with a sporty coat, two dogs, Russian chauffeur, and an English beau. I see! A blonde, elegant, haunting lady with a sporty coat, two dogs, Russian chauffeur, - and an English beau. - That's right. - Young? - Very young. - Blonde? - Very blonde. No, we haven't seen her. Perhaps the lady hasn't arrived yet. In that case, I'll wait for her. - Perhaps in the bar? - Yes, thanks. Bravo! Hey, Burel! What are you doing here in Bordeaux? How about you, Saint-Hilaire? I'm accompanying my brother. Tomorrow he leaves for Guatemala. - Do you have a brother? - No. Well, Archibald? As you see, I'm traveling. - Alone, Burel? - Yes, Saint-Hilaire. Excuse me, buddy. How's your wife? She's in Saumur. - Is she well? - Very well, thanks. And Hubert Carteret? How is he? Why do you ask that? Is there some correlation between my wife's well-being and that of Hubert Carteret? Go away. I'm begging you, buddy, talk to me. Between us, no secrets, no betrayal. We've known each other since junior high. You did my homework. I ate your dessert. It's a lifelong bond. What? What is it? You're right, dear Burel. If a friend like me doesn't tell you, no one ever will. Burel, you're a cuckold. - That's a lie! - It's true. Hubert Carteret has been your wife's lover for three years. - Now that's a laugh! - What? - You're mistaken. - I am? Hubert Carteret is the lover of Mrs. Gorgerot. No! - Now it's my turn to laugh. - Why? Mrs. Gorgerot's lover is me. For ten years now, I see her 16 hours a day. I assure you, it's physically impossible for her to have another lover. You swear you're Mrs. Gorgerot's lover? I'd never claim to be the lover of a married woman if it weren't true. I'm a man of honor. - In that case, Hubert Carteret... - Yes, Burel. Listen, how can you... How can you affirm such a thing? What proof do you have? You don't want to see it. Answer me. What proof do you have? Take your suitcase, get back in your car, arrive in Saumur in the early morning, and go straight to your wife's room. - If you don't find Hubert there... - Yes? ...go to Hubert's and you'll find your wife. I'm going! Porter. My coat and suitcase, quickly. - Sir! The blonde, elegant, haunting... - I get it. She's just arrived. There she is. Sir, your suitcase! - Is my wife in? - No, sir. She went out very early. Stay here. I'll be right back. Sir, I assure you, he's not home. You've come to hunt in my studio? What's that? My sock. Quite a long sock. - Leave that alone. - There's a woman in your room. - That's none of your business. - It is. She's my wife. Lies, infamy, and abomination! Your wife? You're nuts. You're drunk. I'm absolutely sober, and I declare I'm a cuckold and what's more, cuckolded by you! - Come on, buddy. - I've got this, I'll find the rest. Open your bedroom door. - I forbid you to enter. - Out of the way! - You're ridiculous. - Don't say that. If Lucienne is in your room... I'll kill you, certainly. I'll kill her, probably. I'll kill myself, maybe. Lucienne isn't the only woman in the world. There is a woman in my room, but why should it be Lucienne? No. What about this? What's that? This is a bracelet that I gave to her for her birthday two years ago. Don't go soft now. What does that prove? She might've dropped it when she was here while visiting with you. Let me check. It's the easiest way. No! You might lack discretion, but I certainly don't. You won't let me see the woman in there? I have no right to compromise her. - Fine. Have her talk to me. - What? Through the door. If it's Lucienne, I'll recognize her voice. Madam? Hubert's mistress? Please say in a loud voice, “Long live the Republic!” I know her opinions. She'll never say that. Then say whatever you please. “It's a fine morning,” “Idleness breeds vice,” or “A mouse may be of service to a lion.” What stupid sayings! Well? She's not saying anything. No, she's not. But if it's not Lucienne, why does she say nothing? How should I know? Maybe she's sleeping. That's possible. Lucienne! Lucienne? Here she is. Why are you yelling like that? - Lucienne. - See? What? She has both stockings. You didn't just leave Hubert's room? I was at the farm. Ask the old Bouchard couple. I just left them. Is that true? What's all this mean? It means that last night I met Saint-Hilaire in Bordeaux. Bordeaux? You said you went to Paris. I meant in Paris, at Hotel Bordeaux. He told me you were Hubert's mistress. What do think of that? What will people make up next? Well? I rushed back to Saumur to Hubert's place, certain I'd find you here. And you didn't. You're ridiculous. Yes, I am. Listen, buddy, I'm sorry. Here. Whose stocking is that? - The woman in his room. - There's a woman here? - There's a woman in your room? - No. There is, but be discreet! He doesn't want us to know who. I'd really like to know. Of course. Women are so curious! Hubert is our closest friend. We should know about his affairs. - No. - Yes! You're such a child. Take your bracelet and let's go home. My bracelet? - Where did you find it? - Here. That's why I thought it was you in there. This bracelet is no longer mine. - What? - I gave it to Sonia. So that means... the woman in there... Must be Sonia. Can I come out now that you know I'm here? - Give me back my stocking. - He has it. It's sickening. What cynicism! Why? I'm not married yet, am I? I have the right to a bachelorette party. Cousin, do you have any idea... Of what? I liked the painter. He's a bachelor. I didn't leave. I went to his house. - Anything to say about that? - Nothing. And you, anything to say? Perhaps, but I'll say it to you. And I'll answer you. I'm helping you out, you know. Friends, given the situation, it's time for us to leave. Indeed. There you have it. Yes. Case closed. See you soon. - Perhaps. - We'll see. Right. - Come, Lucienne. - Yes, my friend. - That was a bit embarrassing. - Certainly. You should have let me run away to Spain instead of lying in the road with a lantern on your chest. I said, “If she leaves, it will be over my dead body.” - So romantic! - Isn't it? But the lantern was so you wouldn't kill me. I see! - What? - I must return to the farm. Old Mrs. Bouchard is waiting. I need to check on the car in the garage. The motor was acting up as I left Bordeaux. - What? - I mean, Paris. Then... I'll see you later. Yes, later. Traitor, betrayer, false friend! Not again! It wasn't Lucienne in my room. No, it was Sonia. Much worse. Already? What did you do to get her to stay? You wouldn't understand. I put a lantern on my chest. I'll admit I'd have never thought of that. Well, buddy, some are made to be lovers, some are made to be husbands. I must speak to Sonia. - You're here again? - And you too? Why did you come back? I came to get my gun. What about you? I forgot my bracelet. I want Sonia to give it back. I'll give her something else. No need. Now you have your bracelet. - And you have your gun. - Yes. That's that. That's that. Don't you have anything else to tell us? No. Well, then, see you soon. - Perhaps. - We'll see. Right. - Come, Lucienne. - Yes, my friend. As long as they come together, it's not so bad. Eventually, one will come alone. And then we'll hear it! Does that bother you? No, Sonia. You poor man, what you need is a nice bath. - What? - Your hair is all dusty. I'll run you a bath. - I have a proposal for you. - Another one? I've been crazy about you for three days, and since last night, I love you. I love you too, my little painter. More than I'd like. Shall we live together, lost in each other's arms, far from all others? I'll break up with Lucienne, you'll leave the marquis in prison, and we'll travel the wide world, avoiding only Madrid, Paris, and Saumur. You crazy boy! You've been my lover a few hours, and already you talk about the rest of our lives! You'll go to sleep in my arms every night and awaken there every morning. In three months, we'll have a mufti marry us in Madeira. If another man looks at you, I'll kill him! - You Frenchmen get so carried away! - My love. I truly wish you were sincere, that you said fewer words and thought more, and that Madrid, the mufti, and all that were true. I think something has happened to me, something haunting. I think... I think I'm in love. The first time I saw you, I could tell you were very nice. - I wish you were in prison. - What? - That you'd assassinate the king. - What? Then I'd marry you! - That's splendid, wonderful. - It's love. I traveled the wide world three times over, but it was in Saumur that I found love. I adore you. My little painter. I added some bath salts to refresh you, but you have to soak for at least 20 minutes. Fine, my friend. Thanks. - It's her. - Lucienne? But... - You seem upset. - Not at all. - But what will I tell her? - That you love me. Obviously. But how do I tell her? Poor little painter. Let me handle it. - You'd really do that? - Yes. Go on. - Break it to her gently. - Yes. On one condition. Which is? - That you love me. - I adore you. That's enough for me. Go, little painter. Do you have any idea what you two have done? Made love. - Cynicism on top of betrayal! - Give it a rest. Cynicism? Which of us is less cynical? The one who urges the other to seduce a man or the one who simply obeys? That's not the man I told you to seduce! You told me to seduce one, your husband told me to seduce another, so I got confused. I made a mistake. - My husband? - It's your fault, all of you. You think the cousin from Warsaw is a worthless girl. You ask her to do the riskiest, most disgusting favors. You deserve what happened. If you play with fire, you get burned. You certainly turned things in your favor. You stole my lover and left me my husband. I thought it over. It's more decent. Are you mocking me? - I came here to talk to Hubert. - No. Are you afraid? I've never feared another woman. Go on. Thanks. - Are you there, Hubert? - No! I must leave! Leave! Ivan! Boris! Toby! Sonia. - What? You're leaving? - Yes, I am. - With that lucky Hubert? - Alone. I'm off to marry the marquis. That's just great! Now I understand. You stop here three days, just the time to turn Hubert's head, break my heart, and then you say good-bye. That's not nice, Cousin. I don't deserve to suffer so much. Suffer? You don't love me. - I adore you! - Please, don't say that word. - Why not? - Because... Am I loved? Does she matter, the cousin from Warsaw? No. She's just a plaything. She wreaks havoc in order to put it back together. She passes through, and once she's gone, she's forgotten. You say you love me. I'm no fool. No one loves me. No one ever loved me. What a pity! Come on, time to go. Farewell, Cousin. Fine weather. Yes. And this time, I think it will last. Andrei, there's no need to drive so fast. I'm getting married.
