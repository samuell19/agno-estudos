THE YOUNG OBSERVANT Pull that one up. These are the rules you have to follow. Your uniform must be always be spotless. You must always be clean-shaven. No moustaches, goatees, sideburns or tattoos. You must take special care of your feet, which will often hurt. Never put your hands in your pockets. Never run your fingers through your hair or pick your nose. Don't touch food with your hands. Never turn around suddenly but look before you turn and keep a safe distance. Hand over any objects you find to your supervisor straightaway to avoid being suspected of anything. Campani, why did you choose this school and this profession? Because my cousins do this, and my brother. They inspired you to... A lawyer's son usually becomes a lawyer. The... same question. Yes, me too. My uncle has a hotel and I love it when I'm there. So you've already experienced this world. - Burlone? - I like dealing with customers. My cousin has a bar and when I was little I liked going there and watching. Colombini? I like dealing with... talking to other people and I love cooking. Because I like cooking and also because I like the work. The chair. No. Try with the other one. Don't ruin the crown. Did you follow a line? Is that the line? Nice line. That third table's wrong. The third and the fourth. Look. Come here and look. - Maybe the third and the fourth. - Look. This one's correct. Look how it's on the outside. You just follow the tile. You don't need a degree to follow a tile. There. The third one. The other one should be in line with it. Here... Here... This one... This one's touching, this one isn't. Right? So ideally we should do it like this. Right? And ideally this shouldn't go over the edge. When we lay the tables and serve customers, what do we do? Leave things on the edge? That chair there isn't even straight. When you've perfected this, when you're bothered by chairs that aren't straight, you'll feel a need inside you to stop what you're doing and do other people's work too. These chairs here aren't perfect, are they, boys? Imagine spending ten hours a day carrying trays, plates, glasses. This is your basic work. When you leave school in five years that's exactly what you'll be doing. You'll start off as the newest ones. As the newest ones you'll have to start from the bottom, and the bottom is the floor. But let's remember one thing. Elegance, posture... Your clothes may be neat and tidy, but if you don't know how to carry yourself... it won't mean a thing. You'll cancel out the value of the clothes you're wearing. Your outfit needs something else to be complete - a smile, willingness - what is known as courtesy. Courtesy and politeness are also part of a waiter's outfit. Why is that? Because he wears these things too. You must love your work and wear your work, so you must be stylish people who know how to carry yourselves. Tell me about the French hotel classification system. - The French use stars too. - Meaning? They go from a maximum... Here they go from a maximum of one star, hostels... Hostels? Aren't they hostels? All right, from one to seven stars... Or six... Five is luxury. Seven is a category for... There's seven in Tokyo. In Milan too. How are hotels classified in Finland? In Finland? In Finland... What's a lobby? A lobby is the centre where customers are received, where they check in and are allocated their rooms and where customers call to book. It's usually as soon as you go into a hotel. It's like the reception hall. What do I need to do? What do I need to do? - 30 glasses. - All right. Get a move on. No, Luca. I can hear the sea. Do you want to hear the sound of my fists? I can't hear... Hey! - You need to get a move on. - Calm down. In 20 minutes at the absolute latest... One minute per glass. One minute per glass, OK. Less than one minute per glass. Has someone taken my other tray of glasses? - I don't know. - It's gone. If you don't know where you left it... Do we put these in the middle of the place setting? - How do I do it? - Or all on the right? Come here. - Start putting the glasses out. - Do I put it above the knife? You put the side plate here, right? Still water? - Could you bring me some salt, please? - What? - Some salt. - Yes. Then you sweep the floor. You and Burlone sweep the floor, then we'll find someone to mop it. It's dirty down there. It's dirty down here. Let's turn to page 92, where we'll analyse the first article of the constitution. In the first clause it says that Italy is a democratic republic founded on labour. What do you think "founded on labour" means? For example, when you were little did you ever think about what you'd do when you grew up? Colombini, are you afraid of growing up? Burlone, are you afraid of anything? Growing up? Facing the future? Well... You don't have any worries. You're relaxed. - Failing? - Failing how? Failing... your business failing? Failing how? Starting out with the aim of becoming a barman and ending up working for somebody else. So you'd fail because you hadn't achieved your dream? Do you think it's difficult? Do you think achieving your dream of becoming a barman is difficult? - You need to work hard. - What problems do you anticipate? - Competition. - Competition... So you don't want to be... You want to be a famous barman, not just any old barman. Yeah, I'd prefer that. What about you, Tufano? Concerns about the future? We live in the present. - So you never think about when... - No. No. Where does your wish to be a barman come from? - Well... - In my case, since I was little. I liked talking to people... People make me sick. Quite. Making drinks, making coffee... Making coffee... Tufano, Della Mora, what were you saying? I don't like people. - I don't like people. - That's why you live up a mountain. - So relationships with people don't... - No. - You're a loner? - Yes. - You do the milking, then... - You do the milking yourself? I go and fetch them. Then you milk them, you take the milk in the churn, you milk the goats too... So cows and goats? Yes. Then you take the cows out, you make cheese... Hold it a bit lower. Hand behind. Can you feel it? You don't have any trouble. Very good. Look at that shape. Perfect waiters. Well done. Slowly, slowly, slowly. Turn around. Approach with... Listen to see if anybody's inside. Can you hear the television? The shower? Movement? Yes. Keep the tray flat. It's time to knock. A bit louder. Who is it? Room service. Who? Room service. Ring-ring. There. Hello? Rosmini restaurant. - Hello... - Hello, this is Enrico. - This is... - Enrico. Enrico. What... - What can I do for you? - What... How can I help you? I'd like to book a table for Friday for four people. Is that possible? For what time? Around half past 12. Hold on a moment and I'll check. Yes, we have some rooms available and there are suites... Take your hand out of your pocket even if the customer can't see you. Don't lean on anything. You're there to serve him. Sorry, what did you say? I didn't understand. There are some suites available or some rooms... What's the price for a suite? 50 euros per night for bed and breakfast. - That's very cheap. - Really? French word for "knife". Oh, yes... thingy... It's a knife. It starts with a C. Yes... "Cut"... - No "cut" is English. - English. - Bottle. - In English? In English, "bottle". In French? Approximately? Tufano, keep still. I can't keep still. You need to learn to keep still. Can I have a bottle of water, please? Please... Can I... please... can I... Can I have a bottle of water? Tufano, keep still. Again. And in English? It's much easier in English. Keep still. Tufano, keep still for 30 seconds. He can't, he's got ants in his pants. We need to put nails in him like Jesus on the cross. - 30 seconds without moving. - Keep still. In line. In line. Stay in line, boys. Boys, do any of you play in a band? First we need to remove the legs. How do we do that? We insert the knife into the chicken's neck, take the fork in our left hand and insert it into the leg, breaking it off. Then we turn the chicken round and start to remove the second leg. As you can see, we remove the thigh here too, in the same easy way that we remove the leg. On to the next page. The customer is served a leg, a portion of breast and a portion of thigh. Gently. Good. - How come you treat animals so well? - I usually do it with my hands. - Why? - Because it's nicer. No, don't... Remember the line. Before you let go of the part underneath, make sure the tablecloth is properly centred. Shake it and before you let go, make sure that it's perfect... Look at the left side. The right side is correct but you're not holding it properly on the left. Your thumb needs to be on top and your index finger underneath. That's it. Shake it. No, my friend. No... The last edge ended up... Your hands need to be further apart. Do it again. Don't let go, don't let go. One edge needs to be free and you need to hold the other one. Fold it back up and we'll do it again. You try. Try with the water. It's water, it's not... Try it, and with your nose... Throw it away. You promised you'd only put a little bit in your mouths, right? Didn't you? Go on, spit it out. Some went down. If we try to hold a piece of... Hey. He can't do it. In our profession we have to stand still. Isn't that right? Are you committed to doing... Hey! Are you committed to doing this job? Have you chosen to attend this school... Look at me. All of you, look at me. Have you chosen to attend catering school to fill your spare time or to prepare for your future? Besides the cupboards being organised, which they haven't been up till now - I hope they will be from now on because we've rearranged them with labels... I'm talking and he doesn't care. - Get out. - I'm talking about that. What are you talking about? I'm talking now. I'm talking. You're a first-year. First-years mustn't talk when a teacher's talking. Fourth-years don't talk because they know what the work's like. They've been working already. For instance, the menu for the guests, right? The menu for the guests wasn't there today. I went to get it. Yes, but they'd already sat down and they didn't have it. Things like this just won't do. - Come in. - Thank you. I saw it. - Morning. - Good morning. Take your jackets off, make yourselves comfortable and let's start. - Come on. - Should I throw it away? You can eat it later. - Are you studying law with Ms Oggiani? - Yes. I don't think you've done the economics of society yet. Is that right? When we study society in law, we often talk about needs. Humans have needs, primary and secondary needs. Luca, what do you think human needs are? Being with other people... Exactly. - Humans have very specific needs. - Talking... Now, since God has created humans, can God satisfy human needs in an abstract way? What is the greatest human need? It's the need for sense, for understanding why we're in the world. Why do we have to obey laws? Luca, have you ever asked yourself that question? - What? - What all this is about. When you do something, do you wonder what effect it has on the world, what effect it has on your life, what effect it has on your future? - It depends. - What? - It depends on your choices. - In what way? Why do you go hunting? I go hunting too, you know. - What does our going hunting... - It's not just about killing animals. We do it because nature is beautiful. - Hunting's not about hating nature... - Exactly. What does your going hunting have to do with nature? You're surrounded by nature. You don't go to kill every animal you see... You've hit the nail on the head. But... But because... I don't know how to explain it. You need to explain it to them. I fully understand what you're saying. How do you feel when you go hunting? Like I'm in an ideal situation. - Why? - Because when... Can we say we feel good when we go hunting? - Yes. - Why? - It's something we like doing. - Why? Let me ask you again. What does our going hunting have to do with the stars? THE TRAVELS OF MAÎTRE ALBERTI Open the door. One at a time. - These things happen. - These things happen. Accidents happen. Hands out of your pockets. Come on, let's put these ones... Come on, it'll get cold. Only that one goes out. This one's dirty. It's dirty. It's dirty. It's dirty. It's dirty. It's dirty. It's dirty. It's dirty. Change it. It's dirty. Right... we can serve the gentleman. Plates in the centre, serving dishes on the right. What must the gentleman do now? He needs to start sitting up straight. He mustn't do this. Lean forward, like that. That's it. Like that. - Never... - Never have your elbows... - Like this, here. - Stop laughing, this is a lesson. So never like this, sometimes like this, always like this. How do you hold the bottle? Where do you hold it? In what position? Nowadays we hold it at the bottom but it's better further up because if you hold it at the bottom it could fall. Can you show me? - Sometimes we do it like this. - Yes. I mean nowadays we do it like this, but it should be poured like this. Show us. From the right... Nowadays we do it like this, raising the elbow, and we should pour like this. I wouldn't say we should, it's just something that we suggest. Grapefruit. What cutlery do we use to serve it? - We serve it with this spoon here. - With this spoon? With this piece of cutlery... Luca, what kind of people do you expect to meet outside school? I don't know. What kind of people? What kind of people do you mix with outside here? - I don't know. - Enrico? Christian? Mario? - The same question? - Yes. As I said before, people who always think about themselves and don't care about others. You have to let them know straightaway who you are and what you do. It's 9.40am. We'll get off at 5pm. They'll let us in and we'll wait for a bit. I want you to take this very seriously. Don't touch anything, don't shout or run around. We're professional people and we need to be even more professional when we walk through this door, OK? Come on. Here are all the gaming tables, like roulette. The croupier stands behind there. Here are all the slot machines. Card Room, Grand Bar Elettra, Cigar Bar Rigel, Casino Vega, Mondo Virtuale and PlayStation World, Supernova Atrium. Guest capacity, 2,826. For example the breakfast will be from seven until nine o'clock. Ok? So German guests, normally when they come they like to... have breakfast complete. Spanish guests is very particular in this company, why? Because they will always get up late in the morning. Ok. Italian, French, Germans normally you see them, when they open the door... they all come in the restaurant. But the Spanish? No. The Spanish start to come when the restaurant's closing, they start to come inside. The job is not very easy. Ok? The job is difficult. But then, we have been trained... We know how we are supposed to be in front of the passengers. Ok? The guests when they go they have to be very happy... so the first most important thing, is smiling at them. When you serve... you have to smile. Don't leave the stress on the face. Don't show the passenger that you're stressed, that you're working too much. Ok? We have our hours of rest. This is the hospitality industry. When the guest goes from here, they have to be very very happy with the service. Minibar, television. All pretty much the same. One other feature - you can make yourself a coffee, an espresso in your cabin. So they have this service too. Tufano, open the door. This cabin has a special feature. It's got a very nice balcony. Not all the cabins have balconies, boys. There are internal cabins too, and cabins with a porthole. This is quite an interesting cabin. Go and have a look. There's quite a lot of room. Look - a table, two chairs and the world. St Mark's is over there. Imagine you're on a ship in the Atlantic Ocean. Around you there's nothing but a vast expanse of sea. Maybe a whale or two. And then the next day you'll dock... in Rio de Janeiro, or maybe first in Recife. You'll disembark for a couple of hours of relaxation and then you'll go back to work. I'm not presuming to teach you how to fight the battle of life. My intention is simply to tell you, "Boys, open your eyes to these things because nobody's going to teach you." It's a serious business. Your assignment for next time, for you too, Luca, is to find a reason. Tufano, come here. Let's start here. Since you're not interested in theory, start cleaning. - That's better. - Go on, get started. All round there and up here too. - At least here you do some cleaning. - I prefer cleaning. You prefer cleaning. Start on a lifetime of cleaning and tell me if you still prefer it in 40 years' time. Do two for me here. This tablecloth here is clean, so turn it round. Clean... What's "morbido allo yogurt"? Cataldo, is someone doing the lunch list? - I'm doing mine. - You're doing yours... Who's not on duty? Let's see. Tufano, come here. Come on, set the tables. You've got three minutes. Are we ready? Come on, the tables need to be set. You've got two minutes. On Tuesday we're using a stopwatch. Two... Quickly, quickly. Two minutes. The black marks are coming off. Two... Hey... I've spent half my life on boxes like this milking cows. Are we ready? Put that light against the wall. Can we move it, please? Can we turn the other one on? That door needs to be open. My favourite subject... No, I hate history. French. Only because you're here. I don't know. Never mind. Sit down. I've called you in because the two of us need to have a talk. I've called you in to see me because there's no point in your teachers reprimanding you if nothing happens afterwards. You and I need to talk. In terms of your studies, compared with how you were at the beginning, your grades are dropping. In terms of discipline, you've been told off a lot. I can see that you've cut your hair but it's not supposed to be like that. You know that we're strict about students looking neat. Your behaviour is making the teachers introduce special measures, not just for this year but for the summer. You don't carry yourself particularly well, so you're in danger of ending up in second-class institutions. Looking back at our first conversation, I don't think that's something that either you or your family had in mind. So I think that you need to wake up and sort yourself out if you want to get back on track. Do you understand? - Yes. - So now you need to show it. Tufano, go and get a dustpan and brush. Go on. Tufano. How would you evaluate this school year? Are you pleased with it? You've been reprimanded a lot during the year and I get the impression that you find it hard to obey rules. Do you think you've worked hard? Are you still sure that this is the right place for you, Tufano? Do you feel able to do the work? In class you're the best at writing. Why don't you make me equally happy with your speaking ability? Tufano, I believe that the expectations we all have of you are reasonable expectations. Are you here or are you somewhere else? I'm bored. Turn it round. This opens out more. This part goes underneath. Open it out. This part has to be on top. One of you needs to be over there. You need to take this part that's underneath. It needs to reach him, OK? Because then both of you... the higher part... Take the part below. Pull. Keep it up high. OK. Then both of you pull it down together. That's right. Now you move this way. Open out your arms. 32. 35. Don't be an idiot. Put them down, then we'll straighten them up. Well done. Faster, faster. I think it started today... Let's speed it up. Speed it up. In here it seems like... - Do you put them... like this? - Let's do this a bit faster. At least we'll finish simultaneously. I'll tell you what "simultaneously" means, if you like. On the right or the left here? - Arrange them. - All done. The same thing here. The same method. Three centimetres. Bring it down. Here you line it up with the edge. The little spoon needs to be just above, straight, and the other way round from the one facing you. Clean the bottom. The handle, on the outside. Hold it by the handle and turn it inwards. Now round the other way. - Clockwise. - Good. You're working hard, Tufano. - Clockwise. - Starting from here. - No... - Yes. Don't leave anything lying around. Tidy everything up. Tufano, how come you're so serious today? Dunno. What do you mean, "dunno"? Have you really got your head together this time? Maybe. - Behind the centrepiece. - That's really crooked. It's fine now, though. Come here and see if they're in a perfect straight line. From now on, bear these things in mind. When a customer calls one of you by name, if you're not within earshot nobody else should reply because you will be subject to endless exploitation. Your gaze is your own. It's up to you to decide when to meet theirs. Is that all clear? Burlone? Della Mora? Tufano? Are you still bored, Tufano? Let's say it again, then. Never point out a customer's mistake or fault. Avoid talking about yourself and your political and religious beliefs. That way we will avoid offending those who don't share our opinions. The customer is the most important person, the purpose of our work, the source of our fortune. A person and not an object, but not a person to argue with or contradict.
