Gorgeous. But I still choose the Ferrari. Come on, Philipo. A Ferrari over Brigitte Bardot, don't make me laugh, huh? Oh, hey, why not, huh? -A Ferrari is more valuable with age. -(LEONARDO WHISTLING) A woman... -MAN: Come on. -Forget about it. Forget about it. Hey, Nardo, what do you think is better, huh? Ferrari or Brigitte Bardot? What kind of question is that? Well, Philipo says that a man that chooses a woman over an automobile, is a man that does not know how to keep a woman. Hey, it's true. Hey, it's true, right? A woman doesn't respect a man who loves her too much. She loves a man who has an eye for beautiful things. -No, no. -Yeah. No, if a woman loves a man, it doesn't matter what he has. But if a man loves a woman, he's got to give her everything and more. Hey, that's in your mind MIKE: Is that your secret with Anna? I'm glad Nardo's playing, huh? He likes to bet high. Yeah, I need a new pair of boots. (LAUGHING) FATHER: Ah, Angelo. Father. How are you? You're off to the bar? -The bar? -Mmm. This early. No. I go home to my family. Eat dinner, relax. You know that, huh? Then, maybe, maybe later I'll go see my friends at the bar. How are you? Huh? Ah, good, good. But the creche is falling apart, in the house of God and the people, instead of donating to the church, they go gambling. -Oh... -What a waste. Come on, Father, it's an innocent game. What do we do, we, we bet pennies, nothing! And they don't even want to donate pennies to the church! The house of God. (TSKING) What a shame, huh? See you later, huh? Yeah, see you later. God bless you. Hey, Rose! -Hi, hon! -(ROSE HUMS) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what did you do to your hair? Well, the, the brown just wasn't reeling them in. What do you think? -I like it. It looks really beautiful. -(ROSE GASPS) Thanks. Listen, so why don't you come home with me? -Um, I, I can't.

Hey, Nardo, Nardo, listen... I went to the bank today. We need to talk later on. Yeah, later, sweetheart. (SIGHS) (DOG BARKING) Class tonight? Yeah, I got the history of fine China tonight.

Ma. Don't exaggerate. Ah, she gotta do the dish, she buys expensive clothes. Well, I like to see Anna well-dressed, you know. A business man's wife, she should be well dressed. MIKE: Full house.

Nardo, lemme ask you a question. When you go home, now, Anna, she'll be awake for you? Of course. Unlucky with cards, but, uh... Lucky in love, eh, Nardo? Angelo, -eat your heart out. -(CHURCH BELL TOLLING) (MUMBLING) Oh, bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been a week since my last confession. It's me. Nina. Oh, Nina. What burdens your heart? Well, I give the butcher a five dollar bill instead of a $10 bill. And when he no notice, I say nothing. And I, uh... Call my daughter-in-law, a son of a bitch. And I call her mother a puttana, which she is. So I'm not so sure I sin. You should honor your daughter-in-law, Nina. Well, you know, Father that my daughter-in-law was born without a father. And that her mother, Isabella, had more men after that. You know that, Father. You must encourage Anna to come to confession. As for you, the next time the butcher gives you the wrong change, you tell him. FATHER: Twenty Hail Mary's. Oh, Father, so much? FATHER: (SIGHS) There you go. BOY: What's with the pizzas? Are you going to order something or not? Gimme a slice and a Sprite. Hey, is this free or what? No! No, this is a business, no? $2.25. So, this is how Nardo runs the business, huh? Giving free slices to kids? CESAR: No. Once a year for good luck... I make a mistake. So, when does he show up, huh? I got better things to do than hang out in this pizzeria de stonati. Soon, soon. Calma, calma. How 'bout another cup of espresso? A nice calzone? Ah... (SWEARING IN ITALIAN) What I want, is my money! (BANGS TABLE) And they pay you for this? -Oh, Alfredo, of course they pay me and they tip. -(MUSIC PLAYING) So what'd you have to do for this? All right. She is into He-Men. -(LAUGHS) -PHILIPO: Yeah. -So I attach a rope to the ceiling. -MIKE: No! Strip down into my Tarzan suit. You mean the little, uh, thing? A little thing with everything bulgin' out, like bulge, all right. -She's going banana peels by this time. -(MEN LAUGHING) So I make my Tarzan call. (SHOUTING) Then I swing over, jump on her bed, grab her like this! All right, all right, come on, I get the idea. I can a-do that! I can a-do that! (LAUGHING) Oh, Fredo, you're always in such a rush. No, not you, but... -Hey, Nardo. Nardo, he can. -Can what? Hang from the ceiling in a Tarzan suit, then jump on top of a woman in bed. (ALL LAUGHING) PHILIPO: Come on, have a drink, come on. Bruno, give him a drink. You gonna play tonight? ALFREDO: Ooh! I'm gonna win everything back from Angelo. How do you meet these women that pay you for this? I would like to meet these women! (LAUGHS) I got this woman, Kathy. She arranges everything for me. -She takes 10%. -No! Yeah. Ciao, guys. Ciao, Nardo. You gonna play later on? Yeah, I'm gonna play. You tell this Kathy, I'll work for her, for free! ANGELO: Look at me. Look. (GRUNTING) (WOMAN GASPS) What? Huh? You want me again? Listen, you tell your husband. Okay?

(LAUGHS) Oh, hey, lemme, lemme see. -It's not bad, ah? -It's beautiful, it's beautiful. And I have another surprise for you. I know this outfit. Oh, but this isn't your surprise. I'll put that on for you later. Oh. Put it on now. Show me now. Hello, Nardo. -(SIGHS) -What's the matter, Mama? No, it's a big problem, but I don't wanna talk about it. -Mama. -Mmm. Your cousin Lucia's pregnant. Well, it's true. But he did it. That son of a bitch who did to her, this baby. That man, he is a bitch. Mama, a man... He can't be a, a bitch. Um, wow... -That's unbelievable. -Yeah, can you believe it? Poor Lucia. Lucia? Teresa is very sick. She cries a day and night. This is gonna kill my sister. I don't know what to do. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. I'll go see him, okay, Mama? No, he don't want to see you! He's in the city, he's a big-shot, a big-shot bitch! Wait, wait a second. How come my mom's a son of a bitch and Lucia isn't? Well, Anna, it's, it's different, you know. Lucia's family. Oh, Nardo. Well, then, what am I? So, where's Philipo tonight? Playing Tarzan again. -No! -Yeah, yeah. No, it's true. He goes out with these women that pay him for this. Isn't that wonderful, huh? -Incredible, huh? -Unbelievable. And how is the beautiful Anna? (SWEARING IN ITALIAN) Can you believe this guy? I'm gettin' tired of your bullshit about Anna. You wanna play cards, we play. Otherwise keep your mouth shut. Hey, no offense, huh? She just sounds like a prize, that's all. Well, she is a prize. A prize you'll never have, capisci? Now let's play cards. Could Daddy tuck me in tonight? Not tonight, pumpkin. Maybe tomorrow night, okay? (LAUGHS) Fredo, if you had a wife, you'd even bet her, huh? (CHUCKLES) I don't think so, eh. You have to be a desperate man to bet your wife. Hey, don't be shocked. It's happened before. ANGELO: Nice. ALFREDO: Hmm. ANGELO: Nardo. This debt you have with me, I can't afford to let it run forever, huh? So, why don't we settle this now and then we start fresh. How much do I owe? ANGELO: Oh, it's not bad. Uh... About, uh... Eight thousand. -That's impossible. -Hey, you look, you signed each one at the end of the game, huh? You look. You write me a check now and then we continue. I don't have a check but I'll, I'll pay you tomorrow. Don't fuck me around, huh? Hey, I got plenty of money. And what I don't have, I'm gonna win back. So deal. You don't fool me, huh? I eat a man like you for breakfast, huh? Deal. (BEEPING) (MACHINE PRINTING) (CHILDREN CHATTERING) (CHILD SHOUTING) (DOOR OPENS) Isabella, your mother, cannot come here! Oh, it's nice to see you too, Ma. What will she do to the baby? Nardo will not let her come here! What are you talking about, Mama? This telegram for you says that she come! You opened up my mail? What right do you have to open up my mail? Hey! We don't even talk! She got guts to come into my house! She really has a-big balls! Oh, my God. -She really is coming. -Yeah. (LAUGHS) Well, great! I'm thrilled. You hear me, Ma? Thrilled! And I don't give a damn what you think about her! She is my mother and she's welcome into my house anytime she wants to! I will spit on her face if she open the door! Well, I would really like to see you try it. You know, you are such a hypocrite! My mother hasn't done anything that hasn't already happened in your family. What about Lucia, what about her? My mother deserves some respect. I deserve respect! Mommy, Nonna! -Please, stop! -NINA: Oh! You see already what she do to the baby! Come here, baby, come here. Oh, please, Leonardo will send her back to Italy -with all her boyfriends. -(DOOR OPENS) Leonardo! Isabella, she no come here! My mother is coming to visit. And I think it's great. Don't you? Leonardo, I will leave here if she come! It's okay, it's okay. Give me a second, okay? Both of you. It doesn't say when she's gonna come. Well, you know my mother. She's a little spontaneous. Well, why can't she be like everyone else? Oh, yes! No, she's got to be different! She don't care about anybody but herself. Okay. Pumpkin? Pumpkin, doesn't Daddy get a butterfly kiss? Look, we don't know when she's gonna come. It could be soon, it could be never. So just don't get upset unless it's necessary, okay? Leonardo, please. Look, I am hungry. I need to eat something before I could even think about this! Now, were you too upset to cook for me, Ma? For you? Never. Don't worry about it, baby. Come on, let me give you a butterfly kiss if you won't give me one, okay? I'll see you in a minute.

This is my very, very good friend, Nardo. And this is the most lovely and beautiful Kathy Hamilton. Fredo, you and I are dancin'. Ba-ba-ba-bup! We're dancin'. Have a good time. Come on. That was a very impressive performance. Sit down before you tear the place apart. So, tell me about yourself. I'm a business man. Oh, really? So am I. You don't look like a man to me. Money problems? It's normal for business people. Some months are better than others. But a handsome man like you. My, but you have bedroom eyes. -(SIGHS) -(LAUGHS) Don't worry, I'm not coming on to you. I just think maybe I could help. I run a dating service for rich women. I help them find escorts. Men to attend parties with them. I, uh, know what an escort is. They pay a lot of money. A lot. To be with a handsome, strong man like you. KATHY: Wait. You've had a rough night. Go home and rest and tomorrow, come by my office and we'll talk, hmm? I'll think about it. Thanks. You no go to work today, you stay home. Ma, I have a business to run, I can't stay home. You see how your wife don't stay home and take care of you? All she care about is her mother coming. Ma, I'm fine. I just have a headache. I gonna make you some chickie brodo. Gonna make you all better. Okay. (COUGHS AND CLEARS THROAT) I'm here to see Kathy. And you are? Leonardo. Sure. But you are... What? I'm a man. Kathy, there's a Mr. Leonardo here to see you. Mmm. Well, take a seat. She'll be with you in a minute. You're a jockey, no? Yep. You race Kentucky Derby? Oh, yeah, sure. I ride anything that whinnies. Let me ask you something, who do you think's gonna win this year? (TELEPHONE BUZZES) How the hell should I know, huh? RECEPTIONIST: Leonardo? Lehman Brothers? Date time. I was afraid you wouldn't come. I decided I'm gonna listen to what you have to say. Good. Look, Leonardo, you're a handsome guy, mature, respectful, European... I have a few clients very distantly related to nobility, and they like to turn up at social events with a European aristocrat type. What do you think? I'm no aristocrat. Oh, yes, yes. But can you act like one? I don't know. Maybe. I need a count in my stable. I can keep you very busy. And I'd like to start you off right away, interested? I think, yes. Good. A few rules of the house. One, never take a client's number. If you try to set up a date without me... Well, just don't do it. Okay. Two, never divulge publicly that you are a paid escort. And three... Client is always right. Whatever she wants, she'll pay you for. But she's not to be turned down. That would humiliate her. What do you mean, "Whatever she wants"? Well, if she wants to walk, don't insist on taking a taxi. If she wants to eat ice cream mixed with caviar, then so do you, understand? -Okay. It's no big deal. -Good. Now find yourself a tux that fits. Tonight you'll be attending the opera with Countess Fabiola. And let's see... Why don't we call you Count Favo Chandon? -Chandon. This is French. -Yes. And Favo is Italian, that way we cover the whole Euro thing, right? Okay. You're the boss. Mmm. That's the attitude. It's fun, Leonardo. You'll see, just enjoy yourself. And remember, the client is always right. Nardo? Listen, will you be home when I get back tonight? Oh, I'm sorry, baby, no, I'm going out with Alfredo tonight. Okay, listen, well, try not to drink too much like you did last time, -I don't want you to get sick. -No, no. -Okay. -What time you coming home? Mmm. Around 10. If you stay home, your husband stay home. If you go out, your husband go out. You forgot I was home last night. Men can go out with other men. It's natural. My brother, Father Vincenzo the priest, he always say, "An honest woman belongs in the house and not on the street. "The street belongs to men and dogs." Hmm. And what does Father Vincent know about women, huh? He seems to know an awful lot for being a priest. Anna, please. Well, wait, I'm sick and tired of hearing how perfect Vincent is. If your family is so perfect, how come Lucia's knocked up? Huh? What does knocked up mean? -(CRYING) -Anna, go to class, and l, and I will talk to you when you get back, please. -Enough is enough. -All right. -Listen, I got to go, all right? -Bye. -I'll see you later. -Yeah. Oh, Madonna... You were wonderful tonight. Did you enjoy the opera? Ah, yes, very much. Opera is exercise for the heart. (LAUGHING) Oh, you are a charming man, Favo. I'm sorry the Marquis put you on the spot like that. I'd like to give you... A tip. Hmm? Thank you, Countess. Oh. I believe I deserve a real kiss. Oh... Don't tell me... You don't know... How to kiss. Good boy. Now run along. -(LAUGHING) -(COUGHING) ANGELO: You laugh, huh? (LAUGHING) ANGELO: Last man who owe me money... I took his wife. I don't believe it! What a despicable thing to say. Who? From the neighborhood? Whose wife, huh? No, no, no, I don't tell you. But I took her. In my warehouse. Why you do that? ANGELO: Listen... A woman is like money, huh? You take her for your pleasure. Hah. And this man, he had no money. But he had a beautiful wife. Beautiful. Like Leonardo, huh? (LAUGHING) That's ridiculous. Nardo would never let you have Anna. What choice does he have? Hmm? You'll see. I only take what is mine already. Hmm... I believe I deserve a real kiss. Don't tell me you don't know how to kiss. Oh, come on, don't worry. Don't worry, -that bum he's gotta marry her. -Oh... (SPEAKING ITALIAN) -NINA: Si. -I just want a little bit more. NINA: Ah... She told him... -About the baby, you know? -Yes. He doesn't care! (SPEAKING ITALIAN) He doesn't even call her! (SPEAKING ITALIAN) You know in Italy he would have had to marry her. -Mmm. -Mmm. Yeah, but this is America. -Si, si. -(SOBBING AND MUTTERING) Hey, hey, oh, my God... I don't know what to do... -I don't know. -Oh, don't worry. -Don't worry. -What should I do? (SOBBING) Nardo will fix it. Oh, no, Lucia, she don't want nobody getting involved. What, Lucia, this is not her problem! Yeah, how... How can we force, there? Nardo... Has a... -Gun? -Si. MORACI: You notice how nice my mozzarella she is this time, huh? The best in New York! He's a good man. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) -Okay, this brings us up to date, too. -Oh... You know, I'm so happy that things are back to normal. Everything's fine now. Leonardo! Where you been hiding? What hiding? Been working very hard. Oh, to pay your debts. Good. I believe I should be included. Listen I got... l got some cash here, I can give you a small payment. Or, uh... How much cash? $500. Or what? Maybe we play some cards. (LAUGHING) You are a very optimistic man, huh? Maybe too optimistic. -I believe I have some luck. -Okay. I'm a generous man. I give you a chance to win back your money. But, after tonight, please. No more games. It upsets me when people treat me with disrespect. Okay. Okay, I understand. So, we'll play some cards and, uh... We'll see what happens. Okay. Good. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) $3. Calzone is free, no? Huh? Sign of good faith? Okay. -What's in this? -CESAR: It's curry. Curry. What are you, crazy? No wonder you make no money. I see you tonight. (DOOR CLOSING) -Nardo. -Hey, I don't want to hear it. (TERESA SOBBING) Teresa, come inside and get something to eat. NINA: She's too upset to eat. She's been crying in the kitchen since I came home. You don't understand shame. It's too bad. ANNA: I understand wallowing in self-pity. Come on, this is ridiculous. Joanne, go inside and keep her company. -Bring her something. -Mmm. Good girl. -Anna, class tonight? -Mmm. No, tesoro. I was thinking you and I could, uh, spend some time alone together? I made plans with Alfredo. Leonardo... Come on, I hardly ever see you anymore. Nardo wants to see his friend. That's good. Go with Rose, get yourself something. Big sales tonight. She don't like sales. Basta, Mama, all right? Well... Maybe I can find something for, uh, for later. Maybe, you spend some time with your baby. Mama, let her have her fun. RECEPTIONIST: Count Favo. Date time. Have fun! (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Yes? I am Favo. I'm sorry, who? Favo, your... Escort for the evening. Oh, yes... I, I forgot. I'm a very bad girl. Please, come in. (MUSIC PLAYING) Your apartment, it's very... I know. It's dated. I have to re-do it. I want to go with a kind of Kennedy, Palm Beach look next. But I am such a procrastinator. Oh. I'm really a very bad girl. Uh... Your husband... Oh, he won't be home for hours. And then, when he is, well... I could be laying dead on the floor and, you know, maybe he'd... Trip over me. (CLEARING THROAT) Your husband doesn't appreciate his beautiful wife. Oh, it's really all my fault. I'm really... I'm really a very, very bad girl. I should be punished. Do you like me? What's not to like? Can I call you... Daddy? Oh, yes, yes, that's the only way to handle me! Oh, I know this hurts you more than it hurts me! Oh... Oh! You know, Rose and I went to Macy's tonight. That's good, honey. And she told me that Alfredo has the flu. That's too bad for Alfredo. But I thought you were gonna meet up with him tonight. Well, that's why I'm home early. Alfredo didn't show. Oh, Leonardo, come on. You've been going out every night this week. I want to know what you've been up to. Honey, when I'm not with you, I take care of business. Are you seeing another woman? Come on. I'd be crazy to see another woman. I want you to understand something. You're the only woman that I love. (HONKING) (SIGHING) -Hi. -Hey, sweetie. Ooh, looks good. -Yeah. -Nice. -Rose, I was thinking. -What? Maybe I should get a perm. -What for, you have great hair. -(LAUGHING) I don't know, I think Nardo's starting to lose interest in me. -Oh, please. -Maybe I should go blonde. No, uh, no. Look, you and Leonardo have the best relationship I know. I don't know. I wouldn't go that far. I mean, lately he seems so distracted. You know, he's been going out every night this week? And last night he was even too tired to have sex. -Nardo? -Nardo. (GASPING) Besides, Nina's on the war path because my mother's coming to visit. -Oh... -And Teresa's been hanging around the house crying because Lucia's pregnant. (GASPING) No! And, of course, it's not Lucia's fault. -Who did it? -I don't know, some guy she's been seeing. Oh, Anna, honey, it's the holiday pressure. I mean, right here in the Enquirer, there's a story about a woman who killed her whole family on account of holiday depression. Holiday depression? Mmm-hmm. HAIR DRESSER: I love it! Oh, my God! (LAUGHING) Red just wasn't reeling 'em in, babe. I gave you a chance to win your money back, right? Yeah. Take two. Bet. (COUGHING) I fold. BRUNO: Gentlemen, the bar's closed. Nardo, tonight your luck... Didn't run out. It never appeared. You have a saint watching over you. Yeah. Sign. I'll sign. Good. Tomorrow? Not tomorrow. The next day. Or the next day, the next day, the next day. Let me tell you something, my friend, you into me deep. $14,000, huh? This is real fucking money we're talking about. No joke. You gotta pay me... One way or another. Hey, I said I will pay. Okay. Does Anna know you owe me? Don't worry about Anna. She's very beautiful, no? Yeah. Let me tell you something, my friend, you're no good with money. Do you understand? Anna, I think she has a better head on her shoulders, no? Maybe her and I, we can, uh... Make out a payment plan? Payment plan? Yeah. You send her to the warehouse to talk to me. I find it very hard to refuse such a pretty face. You son of a bitch! Fucking bastard! Hey. Take it easy, huh? I'm just giving you an option, that's all. I'm doing you a favor, you understand? Don't... Fuck... With my wife. Hey, Nardo... Don't fuck me around, huh? You hear me, don't fuck me around! 'Cause nobody disrespects Angelo Zampillo. (DOG BARKING) RECEPTIONIST: Give me another pencil. Back you animals, back! Hey, Nardo. Hey, doll. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-mmm. What's going on? Kathy's puttin' a new book together. What book? Pictures of the gigolos for the clients. Women, they come in, they look at the book, bing. Pick a man. I don't want to be in any book. Whoa, you gotta do it, you gotta do it, it's good! More clients. I, I'll talk to Kathy. What is this? You know, cave man, Tarzan, Batman, whatever they want. What? Well, see you later, Count. PHILIPO: Could I get my clothes, please? I can't have a woman... Leonardo, you're the best stud I have. -You should be proud. -Proud of what? It's humiliation. It's bad enough that I had to hit Mrs. Mira, I don't like to strike women. But you did it. She called me. She was very pleased. In fact, this evening I have something very special for you. Fabulous Rockette. Retired, of course. But, an A-list client. -A Rockette? -Look, Leonardo, if you don't want to be in my book, that's okay. We'll work out some kind of 800 number. We'll just take it one day at a time. Keep your pants on. (LAUGHING) It'll all work out. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Hello? Ciao, tesoro! What do you mean you're not coming home for dinner tonight? With what investor? Hey, my son is very smart. Ma, you know, this is a private conversation for Christ sakes! Mama mia, listen how she talk 'bout Christ, that way. Oh, Nardo... Okay. I'll kiss Joanne for you. Ciao. Damn it. He's never missed a dinner before. I used to be married to the producer of the show. He always slugged me on opening night. (LAUGHING) God, I'm glad he's married to somebody else. I'll bet she's carrying an ice-pack around in her purse right now. -(VOICES SHOUTING OUT) -(CAMERAS CLICKING) ANGELO: Anna. Hello. I'm Angelo. A good friend of your husband. Oh, Angelo. He plays cards with you, right? -Yes. That's right. -Hi. Hi. Have you, uh, have you seen Leonardo tonight? No, no. Last night. -Oh. So, not tonight, huh? -No. Would you like a coffee, huh? -It's very cold outside. -Yeah. -Please. Sit down. -That'd be nice. Thank you. ANITA: Ooh... Ooh! Oh! Aw, God... I've been wanting to do that all night. Mmm! (SIGHING) (EXHALES) How'd you like the show? It was beautiful. Yeah. It was good, wasn't it? Damn it! I'd hoped Al would have a flop. He's such a pig! Mmm, make me a drink, darling. And, uh... Bring it upstairs. I like you. So, you're a good friend of Leonardo's? Oh, yes. We are very close. I like to meet his friends. You are a very stylish woman. Uh... I own a dress factory. Right down the street. Carroll Street. Would you like to go and, uh, pick out a few dresses for yourself? On me. Free. Yes, but it's so late. Besides, you know everything will be closed. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Not for my friends. Never close. Well... Dresses do cheer me up. Just leave the drink by the bed. (LAUGHING) I just want to get this junk off. Here. Help me off with this, stud boy. -You got some problem? -I, uh... -(LAUGHING) -Uh... What's the matter, huh? What's the matter? Hey, what's the matter? Oh, okay. I'm not 20 anymore. Hell, I'm not even 40 anymore. But, uh... Who the hell are you to judge me? I mean, you're a fucking gigolo. You're my employee. I'm your boss! Hey, where're you going? Stay here. I'm calling Kathy! You're no stud! You're... Oh! (LAUGHING) Paid for. So, andiamo? Si, andiamo. -Ah. -Mmm. Grazie. Anna. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) How could you do that to me? Rose! Rose, open the door! Rose! What, what, shh! I got some... What? What's the matter, hon? -What happened? -Rose, he grabbed me! Who grabbed you? He grabbed me, I couldn't stop him! He kissed me, he grabbed me, he wouldn't let go! Okay, who grabbed you, who? Who, sweetie? -Angelo! Nardo's friend. -Okay. Oh, God, I'm gonna kill him. l am. He's gonna kill him. Rose, he's gonna kill him! What, you gonna tell Nardo, what, are you crazy? -But... -No, listen to me, listen, listen! Now you listen to me. You tell Nardo, and he's gonna kill him. A husband is no good in jail! I'm telling you. Ask my mother. I don't know. All right. Look, you... You just pull yourself together here, okay? Now look, you got this schmutz over here... Let me just fix you up, all right? Then you look fine and you go home and you don't say nothin'! You hear me, sweetie, I mean it. Okay? I don't know. Be careful, don't break it. It's a sin to waste food. (DOORBELL RINGING) Ciao, Nina. Isabella, you are not welcome in my house. Oh, I see you haven't changed at all and I am happy to see you too. -Grandma, Grandma -(GASPS) Oh, principessa! Look at you, what a little lady you are. Joanne, darling, it's time for you to go to bed, dear. Well, I will put her to bed but first, would you like to see what Grandma brought you from Italy? -Yeah -Yes. Come, let's go. Your bags. -Nardo -Yes, Mama. -Nardo, she's here. Isabella. -Why? Why? -Mama, Mama, Mama. -What are you gonna do? -Get her out of this house. -Nardo, Nardo. Oh, thank God you're here. I need to talk to you. Okay, turn around you have a surprise. -Anna. -Mama. Karina. -When did you get here? -A few minutes ago. I saw the baby. She is lovely. She's such a big girl. And you're beautiful. -Oh, God, it's so good to... -Hi. -Nardo -How are you? I'll see you upstairs, okay. -Well, I have so much to tell you. -Mama, tell me everything. -We're thinking of buying the Borghese Museum. -Really? (IMITATING) Nardo, you should see Mom and I. We were... Tere, it's me. (TERESA SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) She's here. The son of a bitch is in my house. She come dressed like a puttana. No respect. Today, I'm gonna kill her. TERESA: Mama mia... I call you after. -Nardo? -Mmm? Are you seeing another woman? How can you say that after... Come on. But passion and love aren't the same thing. Oh, what are you talking about? When I was growing up, I was so alone. Everyone used to judge me because of Mama. You're not alone now. I'm with you. Yeah, but I don't wanna feel that way anymore. Nina, when we get the new creche in, we put the baby Jesus in there in that... Ah, what's wrong? She's here. Isabella arrived last night in my house. Dio. Father, what can you do to send her back to Italy? I can only talk to her. I'll call her today and see if she can stop by to see me. Oh, Father. Make sure she go back for good. And this is Grandpa and... -Is this Mommy? -Yes. When she was a little girl just like you. I wanna have a little baby girl just like that. And raise her in my own house. Oh, and you will, my love, you will. I raised your Mama all by myself in this very house. Where was Grandpa? Oh, he was very, very far away. I know Isabella left the church many years ago. When she came home with the baby and no father. Yes, you know. You know. I know I told you I would help you. But not in the way you think. I think I should help you to forgive. -Forgive? -Yes. Forgive? What the hell are you talking about? If you could forgive Lucia, why can you not forgive Isabella? Because Lucia is an innocent girl. She was fooled. That man. He has no fear of God. He's not even a Catholic. -He's not Catholic? -No. And Lucia, she is an innocent child. And Isabella was innocent once, too. (CRYING) You no help me, you help her. (SOBBING) I wish my brother, Vincenzo the priest, could be here now. He would know the difference. -Yeah -You never mind. Leonardo will take care of Isabella. Mmm-hmm. Forgive? Never. (CRYING) ROSE: Hey, where's your Christmas spirit? I don't know, wherever I left my Christmas money. Oh, there's always credit cards. Why have them if you're not gonna use them? You have enough of them. Ooh, this will cheer you up. Um, Victor was bragging about the fact that he slept with me to everybody, all the other executives. -Wait a minute, Victor... -Nah, nah, this was a different guy. -So, you know what I did? -What did you do? I told everybody in the office he was... That big. -You didn't. You didn't. -Wrecked his reputation. (BOTH LAUGHING) God, Rose you know that's not so great for your reputation, either. Oh, come on, what do I look like, your mother-in-law? Let her worry about reputation. Yeah, she's so worried about everybody else's reputation she's been cooking like a maniac. You should see it, all that stuff in the refrigerator, she never throws anything out. I swear, she spends more time in the oven than a suicide. -God... I swear this picture looks like Nardo. -What? But Nardo doesn't wear glasses, right? Dammit. That son of a bitch is cheating on me. -He's gonna deny it. -What are you gonna do? He's been going out constantly. Next time, he goes out, you and I are gonna follow him. -Okay. -Okay, we'll take your car and we'll follow him. And I'm gonna kill that bitch and I'm gonna kill him, too. -Kill them both. -Okay, okay, but I need to get gas first. -Isabella. -Father. -Thank you for coming. -It's good to see you. -You look wonderful -Thank you. -Come, let's sit and talk. -Yes. -(CLEARS THROAT) -(SIGHS) So? So, well, it seems I irritate a certain very frustrated old woman (LAUGHS) I think I know. But didn't you encourage it? Oh, come, Father. I know you've known me a long time but you don't really know me. No one does. Certainly not Nina. And though you presided at my wedding with Franco, you don't know Franco either. I know him since he's a little boy. You do not know Franco's pain. Franco, deep inside, loved man. -Not woman. -Dio. Everyone thought this was the perfect marriage. Beautiful Isabella and Franco, son of the richest man in town. That marriage never really existed. Thank God, along came Eduardo. -The painter? -The painter. But that was not blessed by God either. Ah, but he gave me something. Franco could not, he give me a child. Father, Franco was unable to love a woman. Isabella, why didn't you tell me? You could have had an annulment. Oh, no. I had to protect Franco. I could not tell anybody. Besides, it was not his fault. I understand. You do? -Yes. -Good. Because I think sometime soon Nina also has to understand. But, why now? Because I come to this country and I find Nina tormenting my Anna. So it is time for Nina to know the truth. Ah, the truth. -So hard to believe sometimes. -Mmm, I know. I... Father, can you help me? -Of course. -Grazie. Grazie tanto. Oh, by the way, -do you have all your money yet for the nativity scene? -Well, not all of it. Good. Now, you do. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you, Bella. -Arrivederla. -Arrivederla. -So you're leaving? -Uh-huh. Rose, it's me. Yeah, he left now, come pick me up. Rose, your car is a piece of shit. -Hey -What is that noise? Come on, my car is okay. It's good for surveillance. (SIGHS) I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna kill them both. All right, honey, look, just come on, you know, relax let's just wait and see what happens. The whole thing can be this big mistake here, you know. Didn't I tell you, never turn down a client's request. For Christ sake, who do you think you are? Miss Worthy is one of my best clients. She feels totally humiliated. I may lose her altogether. What's your damn problem? I couldn't do it. I count on you to get it up no matter who the client is. That's what I hired you for. If this gets out to Fabiola or Mira... You don't seem to realize that there are a dozen two-bit Latino studs out there like yourself who would kill for such a cushy job. Christ, Leonardo. I was easy-going about the book, I gave you my best clients and this is how you reward me. Look, Kathy, I got a problem. I need to work. It won't happen again. -I can't trust you -I'm begging you. I'll go with anyone that you say. If I give you another chance, you swear you'll deliver. I swear on my family honor. Don't disappoint me, Leonardo, or you're through. Thank you. Thank you. What are you fiddling with? I'm fiddling with this. Ahhh! What are you crazy? Put that away. Well, it'll scare the shit out of him don't you think? Yeah, well it's scaring the shit out of me. -Listen, you just drive, okay? -You are not using that, you hear me? Listen, we're losing him. Could you just... All right, all right, we're not losing him. He's right there. Your cape is lovely. Have a seat. -Is she dressing? -What for? Would you like a drink? Er, no, thank you, I'll just wait. Well, I can't wait too long. -Whoa, whoa, whoa. -Oh, hard to get, I love it. Hey, hey, hey I can't believe you. What the hell is going on? Duck! I don't have to kill you. Your shame will. Well, she's finally asleep. It's all your fault. You don't know how to make a man happy and now my son has gone crazy. It's always the man's fault. You and your perfect son. I did everything to please him. Anything he wanted. And now he humiliates me like this. I've had it. I have had it. The marriage is over. Anna, don't throw anything away until you have looked inside. Mama, I know what I saw. You lie, Anna. Tell me you lie. You lie to ruin my family. -Look, why don't we all just... -Shut up, shut up! -I don't want to hear nothing. -Hmm, you never do. Father Martino called again, mmm? I tell you, I don't wanna talk to him. He don't help me. (WHISPERS) Nobody must know. Where's my son? -He's probably with his lover. -(NINA GASPS) Anna, please, everybody's in pain. Stop. -You see, what happened to my family since they come? -Putanas. Diavolo! (SPITTING) They probably put a curse on him. Oh poor sorella, poor Nina. Anna, find out what is really going on with your husband. Don't give up so easily. Cara, per favore, do it for Joanne, huh? I mean, we got to make some sense out of all of this for everyone, huh? My son, maybe he's another Michelangelo. -(EXASPERATED CRIES) -Jesus Christ. Look. Why don't we just hang some stuff on the Christmas tree? -Let's hang some stuff on the tree. -Yes. Everything okay? Them spaghetti and meatballs, that's our specialty. (I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS PLAYING) Anna, let me explain, it's not what you think. Anna, Anna. I wish for peace for everybody in this New Year. I don't know what to say. I don't have anything to give. Nardo. So, are you finished with penance? My penance is only over when Anna takes me back. Oh, Nardo, Anna cannot take you back unless you talk to her. She doesn't want to talk to me. How do you know this? -I saw it. -What? You saw what? What? Blank. Hate. Oh, you saw pain. You saw a woman who feels betrayed. Nardo, you've got to talk to her. She loves you. I love her. Well, then you must talk to her. Show her that you're no longer a boy. That you are a changed man. I mean, I do not see the point of you standing here in a church feeling guilty and feeling bad. What's the point? What should I do? Well, first of all, clean yourself up you look disgusting, like a bum from the street. Look, this is for your life. It is not for poker, you understand me? No poker. -Understand? -I understand. All right. Do you swear? I swear to God. Do you swear on your baby? I swear on my baby. I've done everything I can do. (I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS PLAYING) Nardo sent something for you. Mama, I don't want it. Anna, don't harden your heart. Anna, he loves you. No, Mama, he doesn't love me. He just goes through the motions. Sorry, Cesar. Thank God, thank God. My son. My son. (CRYING) I never believed those stories Anna said about you. -I love you. -I love you. -But I have done wrong. -Never. And you have contributed as much to this unhappiness as anyone. Me? What? I'm asking for a second chance. -But I need you to back me up. -Back you up? Now, that means that things are gonna have to change. Now, I never wanna hear you say one word against my wife -or her mother again. -Leonardo... Mama, not one word, do you understand? Do you? NINA: Si. Anna, everybody makes mistakes in life. Nardo loves you. And I know you love him, too. Daddy, daddy. It's my daddy. Daddy. Daddy. -(INHALES DEEPLY) -Butterfly kiss. Yes. Come to Granny. Welcome home. Grazie. Marone. Anna, please forgive me. If there's any more fighting in this house, I'm leaving. (LAUGHS SHAKILY) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (ALL GREETING) And Happy New Year, mia famiglia. I want you to meet Lucia's fiance, Shawn, Shawn. ISABELLA: How do you do? It's nice to meet you at last. Nina, can I come in? Ah, it's you. Nina, there's something I have to tell you about Isabella. Mama cooks like a crazy... Oh! We have three cakes and lamb and homemade fettuccini. A toast to the new couple, Lucia and Shawn, and to everyone here, a new beginning. -Happy New Year. -ALL: Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Buona salute. Uh, Madonna. It's a long time until the spring. And all innocent women are gonna be safe from you. Yo, Mike, Mikey! When do you think Nardo's coming around? I don't know. I think he's gonna hole up with his family right now. How are ya? Hey, boys, let's go to that pizzeria and I'll buy you a slice on the house. I don't think so. What, my pizza's not good enough for you? No, Angelo, you're not good enough for us. -Madonna... -Oh, look at that fur. (WHISTLING) Must be a rich widow. How do you know she's a rich widow? Oh, it's my job to know, Mikey. It's still Winter out, but inside... I feel like, I feel like the heat of Spring. PHILIPO: Alfredo, you're desperate.
