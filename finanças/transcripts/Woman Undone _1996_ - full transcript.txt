(Low, ominous hum) (Whispering voices) (Whispering voices continuing) (Low, ominous hum) Hey! There's nothing to do. Come on down. You were a long way out. We got lost. You just sit there. I'll get someone. (Gasps) (Panting) Go ahead and cry, honey. You've got every reason in the world. Aaahhh! (Flies buzzing) You got the body bag? Just unroll it right here. You're gonna have to help, and I don't believe we're gonna get him out all in one piece. It has to be done. Hold that a second. So your husband was driving. Yes. Can you give me his full name, please? Allan Mark Hansen. Just the two of you? In the car? Yes. We have a daughter, Miranda. And... and where is she? She's... She's in... In Florida, with Allan's mother. She's fine. Safe. Do you mean you've called her? No. I just know she is. The sooner you tell her about her father, the better. Now, uh, Nina wants you to stay here for a while and... and rest. But I'll come back later and, um... We'll... we'll find a place for you to stay, okay? You can call me. Do you have a family attorney? No. We just moved to Los Angeles a few months ago. I could recommend a couple of local folks, if you like. Not now. Not today. You've brought Allan back? Yes. Yes, we did. Male vocalist on radio: ♪ no! ♪ ♪ I don't need no ♪ ♪ stretch limo ♪ Allan: This is it! Terri: Wow! It's really tucked away up here! Miranda: Can we get a dog? Allan: Sure, but you have to take care of it. Miranda: I will, I will! (Allan chuckles) (Doorbell rings insistently) Well, here we are! The hansens find themselves in sunny California! Wow! (Allan chuckles) (Indistinct happy comment) I don't think we should put new chairs or stuff in. Let's just make it all a big, soft room, so we can lie around wherever we want. I'd miss the old couch, wouldn't you? I don't know. (Happy gasp) Oh, my god! Oh... wow. How does it feel? Wonderful. I'm glad we're here. Come on, let's go take a look. First day in our new house. (Terri laughs) Look at all the cars! Look over there. I know... all that traffic. Oh, this is nice! (Male vocalist singing on radio) Okay, honey, time for the old snooze-a-rama. (Shuts radio off) This is just like camping, huh? Mm-hmm. This is where everyone's happy, right? That's right. Now, get some sleep. You want the door open or closed? Half open. (Chuckles) Okay. Good night. (Snoring) (Distant sirens wail) Allan: Oh, no. (Sighs softly) Just once. No, I'm not... I don't feel like it. (Indistinct response) (Indistinct sharp comment) Allan. (Gasping) Allan. (Grunting) Yeah? (Allan sighs) Can't sleep? You know how I am. Takes a few days to settle in. Want me to sit up with you? You don't have to. You'll tell me if you don't think things are working out, won't you? That's not what I was thinking about. I want US to be happy. I really do. Are you sorry we're here? Do you miss him? Allan, it was nothing. I want you back. Tell me what to do. (Telephone rings) Hello? Hi, it's me. Hi. Are you all right? I'm all right. I had to be sure, you know? I mean, Allan was really out of control over this... going after me right in the office, smashing that window. Mom, look! Someone there? Yes. Don't stay with him just for Miranda's sake, or because you feel guilty. You don't understand. That you love him? Yes, I do. That you're afraid to let go? Thanks for calling. Be careful, Terri. Offer me a drink, buddy. You came a long ways if all you want's a drink. (Mac laughs) Go on up to the house. Okay. She said it was her husband in the car, but we'll run the dental charts and find out. He burned up right where he sat. You sound suspicious. Fourteen miles from the nearest paved road in a station wagon? Not exactly an all-terrain vehicle. Well, you think she's guilty of something? I didn't say that, but she needs a lawyer, and in this town, that's you or Burt. So give ol' Burt a call. Burt's an asshole. I'd like to think I'm helping this woman. I've got more than enough to do right here, Mac. The simple life, you know what I mean? No, I don't. I can't help you with this, Mac. So, just how long are you gonna keep the law practice on hold? Till I find something better to do. It's kinda lonely around here. I was married eight years. I got used to being lonely. I like it. You've got a chance to do some good here. This woman is spooked, and I mean real spooked. I put her in the eldorado. It wouldn't kill you to give her a call. (Rain falling) Mrs. Hansen? Ross bishop. Thank you for coming. You're welcome. Hope I can be of some help. Please have a seat. Thank you. I assume you have contacted your family. Allan's family. My parents are both gone. Several years ago. If you like, I could outline what has to be done. Whatever. Just some advice. Nothing binding on either one of US. All right. Sheriff mccord said you were lost at the time of the accident. We kept driving and driving, and then we hit something, a broken place, and Allan couldn't... couldn't what? He lost control. And then the car crashed, and it started on fire, and I tried to get him out, but it was impossible. It was dark when it happened? He kept turning onto these little roads, thinking that we could always find our way back, but really, we didn't know where we were. You've never been to the desert before? We've only been in California a few months. We came out here from Michigan. Why'd you move? Allan's company offered him a transfer. There was a lot of work out here after the earthquake. He's a structural engineer. He did towne centre in Ann arbor. That's a long way from here. Do you know if he left a will? Yes, he did. Is there anything in this that would make anyone doubt it was an accident? No. It just happened. How'd it go? Well, she told me the same thing she told you. They were on their way to the inn, got lost, ran the car into the ditch, and it burned up. And she was the only one that saw the accident? She was the only one who saw the accident. So, do you have a client? She didn't ask, and I didn't offer. What are you afraid of? I'm afraid of sheriffs who recommend clients. You've got a suspicious mind, my friend. Bye-bye. See ya. So you found the body in the car. Yeah, I found him in it, and I took him out of it. Geez. Need a ride out? I'm staying in town for a few days. It's too dark out there. Gets into your head. Yeah. Okay, trim. (Distant thunder rumbles) Hi, folks. What are you looking for? Something for my wife. Sport or a defense? Home protection, that kind of thing. We're just looking. This is a good, basic revolver, easy to use. All you have to do is point and squeeze the trigger. Easy. Simple. It's a favorite with the ladies. It's light. Nominal kick. See how it feels in the hand. > How mush is it? Four fifty-nine plus tax. It's too much. Just try it. It's too much. Just try it anyway. I don't like it. We have something similar in a lower price range. No. Terri. No. Look, I wouldn't even care if you never even loaded the thing. It's the principle of it. The principle of it? I thought you wanted it for my protection. It is. But I don't know why you can't see the reality here. I mean, just look around. Allan, stop being so afraid. I'm not afraid, Terri. I'm worried. I worry all the time about you and Miranda. You don't seem to realize that every goddamn hopeless nut case in the world ends up here. Well, then, maybe we shouldn't be here. Terri: Okay, let's go. Miranda: Ohh. Terri: Ohh! Miranda: Ohh! These buildings, damaged in January's quake, were further weakened by yesterday's aftershock, and city engineers have decided on immediate... (TV shuts off) All right, Matt. Keep your eyes open. Go down, turn around, and come back. (Door opens) You went swimming. Yes. I had to get out. There's a public pool a few blocks from here. Felt wonderful. By yourself. Yes, by myself. Miranda didn't want to go? No, she went over to Jennifer's. How was your day? Nothing to complain about, I guess. (Chuckles) I'll get used to the feel-good types sooner or later. I'll go change, get dinner. It's registered in your name. You can do whatever you want. I don't want it. Terri, think. I don't want to think. I am afraid of it. You didn't even hear me come in. Then what good would it have done me? That's not my point. My point is, you haven't even considered it. I have considered it. You have forced me to consider it. You just don't get it, do you? I am trying to protect you, Terri. Someone has to. Stop it, Allan. I do not want that gun in this house. I hope you know what you're doing. (Country/western music playing on jukebox) So, Mrs. Hansen, we need to decide whether I'm going to represent you or not. Well, I guess I just assumed that you would. Okay. Let me be straight with you... I have to know the truth, otherwise I can't help you. Not that you haven't been telling the truth. I understand. You don't know me at all. I just... want to... Get this settled and... Get back to our lives, me and Miranda. Tell me about your marriage. We weren't very happy. That's part of why we came out here... we thought that the change would do US good. It was a mistake. Moving to California? Thinking it would help. We didn't... (Stammering) I-I didn't... I'm sorry. I keep having this sensation that when this is over, Allan and I will sit down and... get things straightened out. Chet Willis, Allan's stepdad. Ross bishop. This is my wife, enid, Allan's mother. My sympathies, Mrs. Willis. Thank you. If you'd like to pick up a rental car, you can follow me back to town. 'Ppreciate it. She should try to get something in her stomach. I don't think she's hungry. You want to try, sweetie? If you want. I think she should. Come on, sweetie, let's hit the coffee shop. When Allan's father died, it was hard. This is a lot harder. (Heavy sigh) To lose a child is... I did what I could. I want you to know that. He really loved you. I know that. He was only 9 when his father died. After that, he... Just... Was always afraid. Afraid of losing things and... Things getting away from him. But he always said that he would take care of you. He always did. But now we can't... (Weeping) We can't take care of him. (Wind howling) You're going up and down These lanes like something's chasing after you. It's just some exercise. Uh-huh. Must do a couple of miles a day. No, nothing like that. My name's Jim. Hi. What's your name? Terri. Well, you look good, Terri. Thanks. What are you, about 30? Oh, come on. "Oh, come on," what? I just want to know a little something about you. I see you around here a lot. Why don't you ask me something else? You worried about your age? I'm worried about how you make friends. Well, Terri, have you read any good books lately? (Laughing) No. (Laughing) Me neither. I don't read very much. I just don't want you to think I'm stupid. Well, maybe I'm stupid too. Well, if you were, how would you know? Why don't you ask me about my husband? Ask what? I'm 36. You look good, Terri. Look at you! It's so weird out here. It's kind of pretty in a way, the light on the rocks, the sky. Look who it is. Chuck said there used to be Indians behind every rock. I haven't seen one yet. Chuck said you'd never know. They melt right into the landscape. What? Your eyes. They're just like the sky. Why did you come here? We wanted to see what it was like. Grandma and grandpa are gonna take you home. When are you coming? I have a few things to get settled. I'll be home in a couple of days. What are we gonna do, mommy? We're gonna have a... Funeral for daddy... Then we're going to remember him and... how good he was to US. I love her. She's a cutie. I think I'll name her blondie. She looks like a blondie to me. Think mom'll like her? Yeah, she'll like her. Happy birthday, sweetheart. Thank you. Now, you stay here. I'm going to go get your mother. Okay. Have you always wanted to be married? All my life. Really? No. So, Terri with an "i," huh? (Indistinct response) Could be worse. (Terri laughs) Where's mom? She'll be out later. What are you doing? You looking for something? I don't know. What's wrong? I saw you at the pool. You did? I didn't see you. Who was he? Who was who? Tell me. (Stammering) Who...? Don't fuck with me! Allan, calm down. Don't fuck with me! If you mean Jim, he's a swimming instructor at the pool, and he comes over and he wants to talk sometimes. What's his last name? Uh... I don't know. What's his last name? I don't know. What difference does it make? What do you mean, what difference does it make? I mean, what difference does it make? Can't you control yourself? Don't you have any self-respect? Allan, I made a mistake, but that was back in Michigan, not here. I love you. I want to be with you, but it seems that everything that I say hurts you or threatens you. I'm trying to communicate with you. "Communicate"? Where did you read that?! I've had enough of this. You've had enough? (Terri screams) You've had enough? (Terri screaming) Damn you! (Knocking on door) Come here! Allan! Aah! Let go! Are you all right? Yes, honey, um... I'm all right. Why don't you and the girls watch TV, and we'll get the party started in just a minute. Okay. Is it... can I help? (Laughing) No! Who's your dog? Blondie. My dad got it for me. Oh, thanks so much! My mom got it at bullock's. Isn't anybody gonna take this? Happy birthday! Girls: Happy birthday! Yeah. There you go, sweetheart. Where's daddy? He's in the bedroom. He's not feeling too well. Make a wish. Hurry up, make a wish! Yay! How you doin'? Fine. Allan saw US here yesterday. Oh, yeah? He thinks there's something between US. Well, I keep trying. He got pretty upset. He's an asshole. No. He was hurt. I had an affair before we moved here. He found out. He thinks it's happening again. It wasn't an affair, really. It was one night. But I hurt him. Did you want to hurt him? I wasn't thinking about him. Nobody should be everything to anybody. Well, what should we do about it? What do you mean? I mean, do you want me to kill him? What? Isn't that what you do with jealous husbands? You're joking. (Laughing) Sometimes I just want to be gone. Where? I don't know. Just gone. (Bullet clatters in tray) Thirty-eight caliber. It was in his brain. Entrance above the right ear, terminated left anterior without exiting. Fatal? As in dead. Could this be, uh... An old war wound...? Nnn... no. Self-inflicted? Possible. But it's also possible he may have been shot more than once, but all the soft tissue was destroyed. His brain was the only thing not burned up. It was protected by the skull. Boiled a bit. When can I have the final report? I'll ned to swear a warrant. Uh, couple of days. Uh, better keep her in the jurisdiction. They usually like to stay near the body, anyway. (Rain falling) (Thunder rumbles) Called Jennifer's mom. She's got blondie. She's gonna be so happy to see you. Go on. Love you. Bye. Thanks. I'll call you, okay? (Weeping softly) (Continues weeping) Jennifer's parents invited US over for dinner tomorrow night. Who are they? Jennifer's one of Miranda's friends from school. Do you want to? No. I'm sorry. For what? For how bad you feel. What am I supposed to say? Everything's fine now? This was our getaway place. She got the L.A. house in the divorce. She never really liked it out here. Maybe she just didn't like being out here with me. You don't know? I don't care. You haven't been practicing? Not for about a year. Does that worry you? Mnh-mnh. Good. I'm one of those people who came charging out of law school to defend the innocent, to uphold the noble vision of impartial justice. And? I ended up in Los Angeles. Back there, the simple truth tends to get lost. Is there such a thing? Maybe not. I'm a good lawyer, Mrs. Hansen. Don't worry. But? I like to sleep at night. Do you? (Chuckles softly) Better than I used to. Strange weather this year. Usually don't get this kind of rain. Feels good. Yeah. Changes all the colors out here. Smell the sage? It's beautiful. Yes, it is. Does it help? Help what? I always used to wonder what it would be like after a divorce, how you let go. We were both ready to end it. We just cut it clean. I don't know what she's doing, who she's seeing. I don't want to know. You sound angry. I'm getting over it. Or maybe you're not. Or maybe I'm not. It was another guy. That's an old story. Let's head back. Whoop. (Thunder rumbles) (Music playing) Does your life ever scare you? Scare me? I mean, like... Where's it going? (Scoffs) Nowhere. It's already here. This is it. Sometimes I wish I didn't know anything about you. I wish I didn't even know your name. How you doin', Mac? Ross. Mrs. Hansen, I'm here to serve a county warrant on you for arrest for suspicion of first degree murder. What are you talking about? Her husband was shot. I need your arm, please. Hold on a minute, Mac. Let's keep it simple, Ross. Then read her her rights. Mrs. Hansen, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law. You have a right to legal counsel, which I assume will continue to be Mr. Bishop. Your other hand, please. Let's go. Roy took a .38 round out of her husband's head. Oh, Jesus. It's in evidence, along with the autopsy report. I'll be booking her in over at county. Right. I'll be there. I went over the coroner's report. Why did you shoot him? I didn't. Then who did? I can't... Doesn't make sense. How did it happen? Like I said... This is crazy. What are you saying? Did either you or your husband own a gun? He bought one for me, but I... I didn't want it, so I told him to take it back. Did he? I don't know. Do you know where it is now? No. (Knock on glass) (Knock) Oh, hi. Do you have an appointment? Dr. Mcnichol, 11:30. Hansen? Yes. Fine. Take a seat. (Telephone rings) Doctor's office. Yes. Is it an emergency? Okay, come in at two. You may have to wait. Excuse me, ma'am, you're not supposed to be here. I'm looking for Allan Hansen. Hansen! Someone here to see you. What are you doing here? Could we talk? Could we go somewhere else? Well, honey, I'm right in the middle of it here. I mean, uh, can it wait? I prefer not. It's almost 3:00. I'll be home in a few hours. Allan. Honey, I-I gotta do this. Come here. We'll talk when I get home. Here, have a look at this... Can I talk to you? Sure. I'm pregnant. Don't worry. It's not very likely it's yours. Ohh. Look, did you tell your husband? I tried. I'll do what I can. What does that mean? I'll pay my half. Of what? An abortion. That's how easy it is for you. I'm... I'm just trying to be realistic here. No, you're not. You have no idea what this is. None. Like you say, it's probably not even mine, so... There you are. Hi. Can we talk now? All right. Okay. Do you think we are... Mmm.... Do you think things are... Working out? What are you saying? I'm saying... Are we all right? What, you don't think so? Why don't you ever just answer me? I am. (Sighs) I wish I could just say something to you without always having to worry about how you'd react. I'm pregnant. Honey, that's wonderful. Is it? What? (Chuckling) What? Don't worry, don't worry. It's gonna be just fine. Allan, I... It's gonna be fine. Don't worry. I understand. It's gonna be all right. We're gonna be... (Sighs) We're gonna be just fine. There are no maybes when it comes to right and wrong. Heaven is simple, and so too is hell. Allan, you still awake? Yeah. What's wrong? (Sighs) Nothing. I just thought you'd be asleep. Come here. Sit down. What's the matter? You know. What, about being pregnant? (Weeps softly) Oh, honey, there's nothing wrong with that. It just makes you sexier, that's all. We don't have to be careful. Allan... Do you think we... Do you think that this is the right time for US to be having a baby? I mean... We've already got so many things to work out as it is. I'm scared. (Sighs) I'm scared of what's happening to US. I think we need to talk about... my having an abortion. Allan, are you listening to me? I'm listening. What are you thinking? I don't know. I'm thinking that things are too complicated. We argue and we argue and we lose our way. (Sighs) I just want to make things simple. So do I. Then let's forget this ever came up. What do you mean? I mean, you won't get an abortion. I think I might have to. Why? Because I don't understand what is happening between US. I love you. You love me? That's why you won't have my baby, you love me? Now, tell me again. Tell me again. You love me? Huh? I don't understand it, Terri. You'll have to tell me. "I love you, Allan"? Huh? "I love you"? (Terri cries out) I think our little brunette Might be a blonde. (Pounding on door) See her eyes? (Television audio continues indistinctly) ...those are the brows of a natural blonde. She forgot to darken them. What's up? What's the matter? Don't ask. I'm going to leave him. Not for my sake, you're not. (Chuckles) Don't worry. What would you do? I don't know. I thought you had an answer for everything. Not everything. On the other hand... I never hit women. (Passionate sigh) (Moaning and sighing) How's blondie? Miranda: She's fine. She peed on grandma's knitting last night. Uh-oh. She pees on everything. She can't help it. Are you all right? When are you coming home? Pretty soon. Grandma keeps on making spaghetti. Oh, no...! (Chuckles) Honey, let me talk to grandma, then we'll talk some more. Grandma! Enid: How are you? I'm all right. We really haven't talked. I wondered what you were thinking. I'm not thinking anything. What the police are saying isn't true. All right. I loved Allan. I wouldn't do something like that. Okay. Is that yours? It looks like the one Allan bought. You know where they found it? It's in evidence now. Probably gonna turn out to be his, isn't it? I don't know. You don't know, or you're not telling? You do know all six shots had been fired, don't you? I did not murder him. What are you saying? You shot him in self-defense? No. Tell me what happened, or I can't go on with this. No. I can't. Why not? (Inhales sharply) Because I don't know what to tell Miranda. What do you want to tell her? Something that won't destroy her. She doesn't have to hear what you tell me. Is it better for her to think you murdered her father? I didn't. You aren't giving me much of a choice. It's not that simple. I'm a good listener. (Sighs) I was going to talk to Allan about a divorce. I arranged for Miranda to go to Florida to see his parents so we could be alone. That was the last time she ever saw him. I was trying to face the truth. Things haven't been right between US for a long time, and I'd been afraid of what that would mean. But then, after Miranda left, I didn't like being alone in the house with him. Did you tell him yet? Tell him what? That you want a divorce. No. Maybe you don't want it. I don't. Just don't see any other way. Do you miss me when we're not together? (Jim chuckles softly) Sure. No, you don't. Do you want me to? If I needed your help, would you help me? Sure. "Sure." What are you doing? I wanted to kiss you, so I did. You forget where we are? I don't care. Don't be stupid. Oh, am I being stupid? If you want to stay married, you are. And what if I don't? Oh, calm down. Oh, what? Am I embarrassing you in front of your other girlfriends? Yeah. Aren't you going to get up and move? I'm comfortable. Do you want to fuck me? Yes. Jim wasn't bad. He was nice to be around. He likes women. He liked me. And you probably don't understand why i'd sleep with him. Why would you? I tried to be everything that Allan wanted me to be. That was a mistake. And then, after Miranda was born, he went someplace inside himself. It was as if... There was nothing more for me to do. It was as if he... Didn't need me for anything. I got lost. But I didn't want to change things. I didn't want to lose him. (Rock music playing loudly) Mr. Mercer? Jim. Ross bishop. Come in. Thanks. (Loud music continuing) (Silence) So what you remember is the same as what she told me. Pretty much. "Pretty much"? Well, there wasn't anything sentimental between US. We'd just try to be nice to each other now and then, you know? Well. She talk about her marriage? She was unhappy, man. That's all? Well, she didn't tell me everything. That's not the way it was. She tell you she was thinking about getting a divorce? Yeah. To be with you. (Chuckles) No, man, of course not. I just think it was all real unhealthy between her and her husband, and she was trying to protect her daughter. By breaking up the family? Actually, I think she was with him too long for her daughter's sake, but that's just my opinion. I assume you can account for your whereabouts on September 2nd. What, the day her husband got killed? Yeah. Yeah. I was at work, at the pool. Taught an evening safety class. Probably forty, fifty people saw me there. Sounds like an alibi to me. Please be seated. Mr. Redmond, are the people ready to proceed? Yes, your honor. This is the gun that killed Allan Hansen. Ballistics will show that. Evidence will prove that the defendant fired the fatal shot. This is the body of Allan Hansen as sheriff mccord found him. This is where the car was found, a deserted canyon road some 14 miles from the highway. The car was completely burned. It took an autopsy report to reveal that the defendant's husband died of a gunshot wound to the head. She said nothing of this. The defendant was found hiding... here. The gun that killed him was found here. The gun turned out to be hers. Simply put, Mrs. Hansen shot and killed her husband and set this car afire to conceal her crime. And as the people of California will show, there are any number of reasons as to why she did this. During the course of your investigation, did you find any evidence whatsoever of anyone else besides Mrs. Hansen and her husband being at the scene of the accident? No, sir, I did not. Does that in your mind preclude the possibility of someone else that might have been there, someone who might have been an accomplice to Mrs. Hansen? Well, that'd be pretty tough to prove one way or the other. Why is that? It was in the desert. So? Well, unless someone dropped something, left something there, it's too rocky for tire tracks or footprints, and in the sand, if the wind blows, it just... Prosecutor: No further questions. Mr. Mccord, the, uh, fingerprints on the cartridges... they were Mr. Hansen's? Yes. So Mr. Hansen loaded the gun. It would appear so. So that, although the gun was registered in Mrs. Hansen's name, Mrs. Hansen did not load the gun. It would appear not. Thank you, sir. Is this a record of your examination of Mrs. Hansen? Yes. And how would you describe her condition in general that day? A few minor injuries... painful, but not serious. And her frame of mind? Well, she didn't cry. She didn't react much at all. I thought she was... Pretty tough. Tough? Or cold? Y-You don't really know, Mrs. Hansen, do you? You don't know what she was thinking... You're gonna have to take the stand, and you've got to tell the jury what happened... the whole thing. They need to hear it from you. All the way to the end? All the way to the end. Prosecutor: Your honor, I'd like to enter this medical record as people's exhibit 15. No more questions. Mrs. Hansen, you loved your husband, didn't you? Yes. Do you love your daughter? Yes. Why was she in Florida? She goes there every year to visit her grandparents. Was this year just like every other year? No. We sent her early. Why? Allan, my husband, and I needed to talk some things through. We needed to be alone. He decided that we should drive out to the desert, to the mojave oasis inn. Only you never made it to the inn. No. What was on your mind that day? That if things didn't get better between US, we may have to get a divorce. Radio deejay: Hope you all are having a good day out there. Enjoy this next tune. (Country/western song playing on radio) Is this the road? Fifty-eight... that's what the sign said. It's heating up. Puts a strain on the engine. Is it dangerous? We just have to be aware, that's all. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Are we okay? Yeah, yeah. We're okay. Ohh. I think this little getaway is gonna be good for US. I haven't exactly made it easy for US, have I? Things can't be the way they were. I know. They won't. We just have to put everything behind US. Allan, I really need to talk to you. Do you want to talk now, or do you want to wait till we get there? It's okay. I had the abortion. I had to. What are you thinking? There's the sign for the inn. Turn right. Where are you going? I want to go back. That's what you want to do. I don't want any distractions. I don't want to go any further. There's that "I want" again! What do you think having a child would have meant to me? I don't know. You don't know. But you went ahead anyway. What do you think Miranda means to me? It's not the same. How's it different? Circumstances are different. There's always circumstances, Terri. There were circumstances with Miranda. If you recall, we had to get married. If you recall, we had no money. Things were good between US. So we wouldn't have Miranda now? Oh, fuck you, Allan. Fuck you and your goddamn "if you recall." You sit around all day, you think this shit up, and it makes you feel good because you think that you're right and I'm wrong. And you won't forgive my mistake, and I apologize and I apologize. I'm not gonna apologize anymore! You haven't apologized yet! I've been apologizing to you since we moved here! I'm not talking about that! I'm talking about the abortion! Maybe you don't understand, Terri. You killed our child. It hurts you when I say that, doesn't it? Everything about US hurts. Well, what do you think it does to me?! You could have tried to understand. Understand what? That you murdered my child? Don't say that. Why? Because it's true. Because it might not be yours. Goddamn you! Goddamn you! (Terri screaming) Things are pretty simple now, Aren't they? (Gunshot) They couldn't get any simpler. (Distant thunder rumbles) You know how I found you? I smelled you. Allan, put the gun down. Please? Please? (Thunder rumbles) The police will find you, no matter what. I know that. We could go back. I wasn't planning on it. What about Miranda? I'm not even sure Miranda's mine. I loved you once. No. You don't care about me. You don't care about Miranda. All you care about is that I fucked someone else. I don't care about anything anymore. Allan, wait. I lied to hurt you. I'm still pregnant. You'd say anything. You just want to live. (Audible exertion) (Terri shrieks) (Distant coyote yelps) I can't get out! (Terri cries out) Do something, Terri! Allan! (Allan screaming) I can't! (Screaming) God! Help me, Terri! Help me! Oh, dear god! Oh, my god! Aaahhh, god! Oh, dear god! (Screaming) Terri! (Screaming) (Gunshot) (Screaming stops) (Man coughs) Now, let me understand... you claim you shot your husband because... He was suffering, and there was no hope. None? None. And you only shot him once? And you testify that he fired at you just once? Yes. Well, when the gun was recovered, there were six expended cartridges. Coyotes. Afterwards, these... Coyotes kept coming around, and I shot at them to get rid of them. He was gone, but... Somehow I thought I could protect him. Mm-hmm. You haven't been employed since moving to California. Is that so? That's right. And how do you now propose to support your daughter and yourself? I've worked editing academic publications. I'll find something. Does that sort of thing pay well? Not particularly. But perhaps supplemented by a substantial life insurance settlement. Objection. Irrelevant conjecture. Sustained. Was the gun always in the glove compartment? No. Well, it was registered in your name. He bought it for me. Well, why was it in the car? I don't know. Well, there it was. There you and your husband were, in a trackless, desolate wilderness, your daughter far away, your family ignorant of your whereabouts, your marriage troubled such that only four days before you had an abortion. Objection. Your honor, Mrs. Hansen cited this herself during treatment for her injuries. I refer you to people's 15. A legal medical procedure does not constitute prima facie evidence of motivation. Sustained. Mrs. Hansen, why did you conceal the weapon you used in a dark crevice of rock? Because I'd hoped no one would have to know. Well, if you were innocent, wouldn't you want everyone to know? The way that he died... I thought it would be too cruel, for them. For who? For his parents. For our daughter. And what about you? Weren't you trying to protect yourself? Yes. From being caught. From no one believing me. You must admit, it strains the imagination. I'm telling you what happened. Well, I only wish you had done so before charges were filed. You wouldn't have believed me then, either. So you see, I really had no choice. Allan Hansen bought this gun. Allan Hansen loaded it. Allan Hansen put it in the glove compartment. And Allan Hansen, out of his own rage, intended on killing his wife with it. And he almost did. Terri Hansen is not a perfect woman. There's was not a perfect marriage. But marital failure and moral standards are not on trial in this court. The truth is, Terri Hansen had no motive to commit this crime. Allan Hansen drove the car. Allan Hansen trapped himself inside that fire. His wife simply gave him the only mercy he had left. Terri Hansen is innocent of the charges set before you in this courtroom. She's innocent by any standard of decency, and certainly innocent by any legal standard. I trust that you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, will find exactly that. Thank you. Your honor. They've returned. It's time to go. Good luck. Please rise for the reading of the verdict. On the single count of first-degree murder, we find the defendant guilty as charged. (Gavel bangs) She looks great, Doesn't she? She looks real good. She likes Florida. This is her new school. How are you doing? It's very simple here. You can't allow yourself to wish for things you don't have, so you enjoy what you do have. Yeah. I think we can expect work release, about another four years. You have to go. Got a deposition over in inyo. At night here, you can smell the farms... the hay, the water. This is nice country. I'll be through here next week. I'd like to come see you. Next week. Maybe I don't have to say this, but I believe it happened the way you said it did. I did what I had to do.
