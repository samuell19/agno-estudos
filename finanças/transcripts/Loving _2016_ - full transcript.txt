What you think? I think we won. RAYMOND: That's fine right there. Now, come on. Come on, now. Come on. Now that's a fast car you fellas got. And it's mighty fine of you to let us boys race with y'all. MAN: Whoo! (FOLK MUSIC PLAYING) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (LAUGHTER) Get your hands out there, come on. Come on, Garnet, come on. Get ready to dance with old Virgil. Come on. (PEOPLE CHEERING) Damn, Richard. Slow down. - All right now. - Where you going? (SIGHS) What you think? Do you like it? Like what? This spot. Right here. This field? Yeah. This field not a half a mile from my house I've been knowing all my life? (CHUCKLES) Yeah, yeah. Yes. I like it. (CHUCKLES) I'm gonna put the kitchen back. Right back here. Richard, stop this! I don't know what you're saying. I bought it. This whole acre. I'm gonna build you a house. Right here. Our house. Mildred? Yes? Would you marry me? Garnet, come. He said he'd bought the whole acre for me. And then he asked me to marry him. - No he didn't! - Yes. - Right out in the field? - Uh-huh. Oh, Lord, that man might be crazy. Well, when you gonna do it? He didn't say. Soon, though. Before the baby comes. (SIGHS) He gonna take my sister from me? No. We'll be right down the road. (LAUGHING) LOLA: Everything looks fine. - Thank you, Miss Lola. We'll see you soon. - We'll be here. Hey, now. - Hey, Momma. - They're out back. (CAR ENGINE STARTS) (MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) - How we doing? - Hmm. Get that board and get up under there. See if you can get that collector loose. (SIGHS) So I'm gonna take Mildred up to D.C. to get married. So, you sure about that? - Yeah. - (CLANKING) And you need a witness? No. I'm gonna ask her dad to come up there with us. Rich is gonna take Mildred up to D.C. to get married. String Bean? Don't make no damn sense. Now, you'd be fine living in the house. No wife, just fine. You don't need no wife. Well, now, she gonna be your girl. Why people wanna get married? Don't make no sense, man. You think they'll see us today? Yeah. I called up there. Seem like a long drive to me. Thanks for coming, Jake. Daddy, what's the city like? It's fine. MAGISTRATE: Marriage is an institution of the highest importance. And it's made honorable by faithful couples who are committed to each other for life. Do you have the ring? By the power vested in me by the District of Columbia, I now pronounce you husband and wife. GARNET: I may not forgive him. Come on, now. You lucky if I forgive you. No reason to go all the way up there for this and not take us. We took Daddy. - Like that means a thing. - (CHUCKLES) Richard said there would be less red tape in Washington. That's all. You can stop looking at it, String Bean, you know it's purdy. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) I'm turning in. What you think 'bout a bedroom in the back? I'll like it however you make it. I'll be in there soon. Mmm-hmm. I thought something like this. (ENGINE TURNS OFF) Hey, Momma. Sheriff's Deputy came by looking for you. What did he want? Wanted to find you. Hmm. Did you tell him where I was? I didn't have nothing to tell him. (SCRUBBING) (LAUGHTER) GERALD: Like me raising a barn, but, you know... RICHARD: Thinking the kind of fuel in that car, that was different. - RICHARD: That car was great. - Applesauce good. GERALD: But, you know... What you like, Rich, Ford or Chevy? Eh, don't make much difference. DAVIS: But which one faster? That depend on who built it. That's what I said. How much money you win with that car? Boy, why you're asking him about his money? He doesn't have to answer me. How many races you won, Rich? RICHARD: Oh. Uh... A lot. (ALL LAUGHING) You need my hand, you need my hand, too? Count on this one. I didn't think he was gonna stop. DAVIS: I wanna know, you know? THEOLIVER: Ask that question... - (CRASHING) - In here! What you doing in that bed, boy? - Richard? - What're you doing in bed with that woman? I'm his wife. (SIGHS) That's no good here. Get your pants on, boy. You get out of that bed. Get out of that bed! All right. Come on. All right. (DOOR CLOSING) She goes in there. It's all right. - Come on! - It's okay. It's okay. (CELL OPENS) Richard Loving? Yeah. You made bail. Bean? Bean? Richard? (SIGHS) Go on down. - What about her? - Just you. What do you mean? Wait, wait. Wait! Don't pull me again. - Come on now. - That's not right. Bean. Richard? - It ain't right now! - Come on! It ain't right! Sign at the bottom. What about my wife? You'll have to talk to the Judge about that on Monday. Monday? (SCREAMING) That's good. Okay. Just rest. Just rest. Richard! - Richard! - Yeah? Bring me that fresh water and take this one out. Okay. - Bear down. - (GRUNTS) - Bear down. - (GROANING) - Here, Mom. - Leave that down. Good. Good. Wait. Wait. (SIGHS) (LAUGHTER IN DISTANCE) What you gonna do? How did they know to come get us? Somebody talked. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) - MAN: Hey! - (KNOCKING) Hey! CLERK: We told you to come back on Monday and talk to the Judge. I ain't gonna let her stay there till Monday. - It's not right. - Talk to the Judge. You're not allowed to bail her out. - I'll get a lawyer. - You can. (TELEPHONE RINGING) BROOKS: Hey, boy. Come on. Sit down. You back here trying to bail her out? You know they aren't gonna let her out to you? You best send some of her people up here to get her, because they won't let her out to you. - But, she's pregnant. - Shut your mouth about that. I'll throw your ass back in there for that. You know better. It's just not... What's that? You do know better, don't you? Nah, maybe you don't. (SCOFFS) Your daddy worked for a nigger, didn't he? Running timber? I'm sorry for you. No, I really am. All you over there in Central Point don't know up from down. All mixed up. Part Cherokee, Rappahannock, part niggra, part white. Blood don't know what it wants to be. You just got born in the wrong place, is all. I see you got to thinking it was fine. You might think people around here wouldn't care. (CHUCKLES) Hell, maybe they wouldn't, if your dumb country ass hadn't gone off and married her, but not me. You hear me? That's God's law. He made a sparrow a sparrow and a robin a robin. They're different for a reason. No. No. You go on now. Get on home. Send some of her people up here on Monday to get her. I see you trying to bail her out again, I'll arrest you. (DEEP SIGH) (CELL DOOR OPENS) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) I should put you in with her tonight. (CELL DOOR CLOSES) Your daddy posted your bail. (TYPEWRITER KEYS CLACKING) (SOBS) It's all right, Bean. - (CRYING) - It's all right. Where's Richard? He moved his things out. Said they'd arrest y'all again, if they catch him here with you. Now, come on. Come on here. Come on. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (DOOR CREAKS) RICHARD: Bean? Hey. It's okay. Oh, I got you. (SNIFFLES) You okay? They hurt you? No. I'm just scared. They said I couldn't see you. I know. What are we gonna do? I got a lawyer. They say he's the best in the county. He gonna get it all straightened out. - I don't know. - It's fine. All we gotta do is just keep to ourselves for a while. And this will blow over. Yeah? (SNIFFS) I better go. (SIGHS HEAVILY) Better go. FRANK: We'll walk over there in a minute. But I met with the Judge this morning, and I worked out a deal I think is pretty fair. Judge Bazile is a friend. But he is not a fan of your particular situation. If you all plead guilty, the Judge is willing to suspend any prison time. Hmm. We'll do it. Now, in exchange for suspending the jail time, you and your wife, unless you decide to dissolve the marriage, will be forced to leave the state. Leave the state? What does that mean? It's exactly what it sounds like. You two are not allowed to be in the state at the same time, and certainly, aren't allowed to be here together. For how long? How long will that last? Twenty-five years. That can't be right. Look, you got a year in state penitentiary, which, I remind you, could have been up to five years at the maximum, you got a year in prison on one hand, and leaving the state on the other. That's an easy choice. FRANK: Try not to talk unless he directly asks you a question, which he won't. Just like we talked about, he'll ask what you plead, you say guilty, and this will be over quick enough. WOMAN: "...the said Richard Perry Loving, "being a white person, and the said Mildred Dolores Jeter, "being a colored person, did unlawfully and feloniously, "go out of the state of Virginia, for the purpose of being married "in the District of Columbia, on June 2nd, 1958, "and afterwards returned to, "and resided in the County of Caroline, "State of Virginia, cohabitating as man and wife, "against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth." How do you plead? Guilty. Guilty. The court does accept the plea of guilty, and fixed the punishment of both accused at one year in jail. The court does suspend said sentence for the period of 25 years, upon the provision that both the accused leave Caroline County and the State of Virginia at once. And do not return together at the same time to said county and state for a period of 25 years. Do either of you have anything to say? No, sir. No, sir. You are released from custody. Settle your court costs with clerk. (GAVEL BANGS) Thank you, Your Honor. CLERK: It's 36 dollars and 29 cents apiece. MILDRED: That's a number in Washington for Nancy's brother Alex. His wife Laura's there most days. If you need to get us, just call. Okay. Daddy? (SIGHS) You okay? You knew what you was doing taking her up there! You had no right for that! (DOOR CLOSES) Bean? (CAR DOOR CLOSES) (CAR DOOR CLOSES) (CAR ENGINE STARTS) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) How you all doing? - We're fine. - (CHUCKLES) Thank you for taking us. We've got plenty of room. - You remember Richard? - Yes. Thank you. No. Glad to have you. Come on in. Let me show you the house. Yeah, they live, like, what, two blocks over there, right? I know them. (INDISTINCT TALKING) Okay. I'll be back by dinner. (CAR DOOR CLOSES) (CAR ENGINE STARTS) (SIGHS) TV ANNOUNCER: If the vehicle goes aloft at too step an angle, its velocity is cut by 800 feet a second. Working more directly against gravity than planned. Reaching over 23,000 miles an hour, it carries to nearly 80,000 miles. Thirty times as far as ever before... Another moon shot is... What can I do? Nothing. Bean. It's just... I always thought your mother would be the woman to deliver the baby. (RICHARD GRUNTS) Damn it. Okay. Okay. (TIRES SCREECHING) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Hey, Momma. Put some wood in the stove. (CLANKING) Thank you for doing this. All right. All right, String Bean, it's on you now. (CHUCKLES) - Yes, it is. - Drink this. GARNET: Rich! Rich! Her water broke. (CHUCKLES) (MILDRED GRUNTING) Okay. Take a breath. Take a breath. - (PANTING) - LOLA: Breathe. Okay. Bear down. - Bear down hard. - (SCREAMING) Thank you, Momma. You never should have married that girl. Well, I thought you liked her. I like a lot of people. That doesn't mean you should have gone and done what you did. You knew better. GARNET: Sidney. Hi, Sidney. (LAUGHS) Sidney. (CHUCKLES) (VEHICLE APPROACHING) Call the lawyer. Tell that woman to come out here. She ain't here. She left. Boy, I will split your head into white meat, and go arrest every soul in that house. I won't ask you again. No. (DOOR OPENS) (CAR DOOR CLOSING) DEPUTY: You are in luck. The Judge is in today. You'll go straight there. For violation of your parole, you are ordered to post a $200 bond, and appear before this court... - In the next... - (DOOR OPENS) (SIGHS) Yes, Frank? (PANTING) We ask for leniency. I incorrectly told the Lovings it was fine for them to return home for the birth of their child. It... It was my mistake. Your Honor, I think... Fine. Thank you. Don't come back here again. You do and you go to prison. This doesn't happen a second time. (BABY CRYING) (DOORBELL RINGS) Sidney, Donald, come on down. Hey! Okay. Okay. Come on in. - You go. - (GRUNTS) GARNET: Hi, pretty girl. (LAUGHS) Your cousin, Gerald and Davis, are fine, and Sue and Terry send their love. They just had a little girl, too. - Really? - Their second. Hmm. Sidney, don't jump in the house. They're big. Yes. (SIGHS) I hate it for them. It's like they're caged. Not even any grass for them to run in. (SIDNEY YELLS) And Daddy? He's fine. Stays up in that chair more than in the field. I told Momma if he don't start getting some work done, Mr. Banks liable to find someone else for it. Clay said he'd have to stay with me until after the party. (VOICE FADES) - (ENGINE STARTING) - (HORN BLOWING) - Good. How are you doing? - Where is that piece? How was your sister? - SIDNEY: I need one piece. - She's fine. - I almost have it. - Yeah? You wanna show me? ANNOUNCER: The long awaited march for jobs and freedom on Washington D.C., has started and it's about half of the 100, 000 estimated crowd headed off down Constitution Avenue toward the Lincoln Memorial which is where we're seated now. It is here that the climax of the march... You boys stop that wrestling. Come and help Miss Laura with her groceries. ...coming in around the plaza surrounding Lincoln Memorial. They say over 100,000 people are there. ...is standing by along the parade route at 17th and Constitution. Can you imagine? Might as well be half way around the world. LAURA: What? Nothing. LAURA: You know what you need to do? What? You need to write Bobby Kennedy. (SCOFFS) I'm serious. I mean, that's what they up there for. All this talk of civil rights. You need to get you some civil rights. ANNOUNCER: ...engaged in demonstrations before. In the background, you can hear some of the young people shouting. (CROWD CHANTING) "Freedom, freedom now." Mmm. - They in bed? - Mmm-hmm. I'm sorry I missed them. They ask for me? Peggy did, but she went down fine. Will you get Saturday off? I hope so. Sidney, get up and strip those sheets for me. My turn, my turn, my turn! My turn. Don, make sure your sister gets a turn. My turn, my turn, my turn. (TELEPHONE RINGS) Byrd residence. BERNARD: Hello, I'm calling to speak to Mildred Loving. This is she. BERNARD: Hello, Mrs. Loving, my name is Bernard Cohen, I'm the lawyer that was referred to you by the ACLU. Are you familiar? I'm sorry. No. You wrote a letter to Attorney General Kennedy, is that right? Yes. He was not able to help you with your particular case, and sent your letter to the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU contacted me, I'm a lawyer in Virginia, and we would like to help you with your case. I see. - Momma! Momma! - Don, baby, hush. BERNARD: Would it be possible for you and your husband to meet with me? (DON SHOUTING) I would have to check with my husband. BERNARD: Okay. I'm based in Alexandria, but I have an office in D.C. If that is a concern. Well, as I said in my letter, we really can't afford a lawyer. BERNARD: No, ma'am. The ACLU will take care of any fees. Mrs. Loving? Are you there? - Yes, we'll see you. - BERNARD: Wonderful. I'll have my secretary call you back to set up a time. Nice speaking with you, Mrs. Loving. (LINE DISCONNECTS) MILDRED: Come here, baby. I got a call from a lawyer today. - A lawyer? - Mmm-hmm. From the American Civil Liberties Union. Robert Kennedy told him to call us. Go help your sister brush her teeth. They wanna help with our case. Well, we can't afford a lawyer. He said they wouldn't charge us. I'm gonna go see him on Thursday. His name is Cohen. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hello. I'm Bernard Cohen. I'm in from Richmond. I talked to Jim about using his office for a few hours. Yes, Mr. Cohen, do you know it? - Down the hall? - Yes. My clients are Mr. and Mrs. Loving. Could you send them down when they arrive? Certainly. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Come in. - Mrs. Loving. - Hello. Please, have a seat. Bernard Cohen. It's a pleasure. Thank you for coming in today. So, as we discussed on the phone, the ACLU would like to take on your case. I was actually a charter member of the ACLU in Virginia, which is why they assigned me to you. The bottom line is, we wanna get you all some relief. That's very generous. Thank you. Now, the first step is to appeal the sentence in Caroline County. That will be our fastest route to Federal Court. - The problem is... - Federal Court? Yes, the goal is to try to get the Federal Court to hear the case... Excuse me, I don't understand... Federal Court. I see it as the best route... Can't you just go and speak to Judge Bazile? I mean, we ain't hurting anybody. - I don't think that... - Well, just talk to him. Just talk to him. Just tell him if he lets us back in the state, (SIGHS) we won't bother anybody. Look, I do not think that this case will be resolved in Judge Bazile's court, or probably any other court in the state of Virginia. I believe this is a court battle that could go all the way to the Supreme Court. We're listening. Our problem is that in order to appeal the judgment of conviction, we would have needed to do so within 60 days. Now, given that it's been five years since that conviction, we have to find a way to get it back into the courts. - Are you following? - Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Now, I've given this some thought, and I have a somewhat unorthodox idea on how to do this. My suggestion would be for the two of you to return to Caroline County, get re-arrested, and then we will have an avenue for our appeal. You want us to get arrested again? Yes. It's an idea. I, of course, will be there to bail you out. We aren't gonna do that. Right... I can see how that was a mistake. I understand. Look, I need to do some more thinking on this first issue, but, bottom line is we are gonna get you all some help. We appreciate you. We really do. (SIGHS) Yeah. (DOOR CLOSES) (SIGHS) (SIGHS) If it gets us home, we'll take their help. Well, you get what you pay for. (ENGINE STARTING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (CAR HORN BLOWING) Get off the street! MAN: Lee, give him a hand! (KIDS CHEERING) MAN: You gotta pull that concrete. Yeah. Pull more. - Whoo-hoo! - DONALD: I got it! MAN: Hey! - (GRUNTS) - MAN: Look out! Donald! SIDNEY: Momma! Momma! (SIGHS) - Mildred! - MILDRED: Up here! What's going on? Donald got hit by a car today. What? He's fine. Just scraped and bruised is all. Hey. You okay? I wanna move 'em back to the country. I don't care what they do to us. I won't raise my family here. (SOBS) All right. Y'all get loaded up now. Come on. Thank you, Al. KID: Thank you, Don. Thank you, Miss Laura. Hmm. You just go on. I'll see you tonight. - You all be good. - PEGGY: Okay, Daddy. (ENGINE STARTS) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Hey. (KNOCKING) PEGGY: Daddy! My cousin has a house he might rent out. But I thought Jim's brother said it was fine here. I don't trust them. Too many people. Where is it? RAYMOND: King and Queen County. Just a farmhouse up there. I figure it gets you out the county, but keeps you close. You'll be on your own out there. It don't have no phone or nothing, but no one's gonna find you unless they know to look. I can get word to you when you need it. How much you think he'd want for it? Ah, he'll be fair. (SIGHS) (CAR HONKING) PEGGY: Hey, look. (PEGGY LAUGHING) DONALD: Peggy! Hey. RICHARD: I'll try and get home before dark. Mmm-hmm. We'll be fine. "We haven't heard anything from you for so long we had given up hope." (EXHALING) Martha, call Chet Antieau's office at Georgetown Law and try to set a meeting. MARTHA: (ON PA) Yes, Mr. Cohen. (SIGHS) - (DOOR KNOCKS) - Come in. I'd never seen anything like it, you know. Excuse me. No matter how many times I get down south, there's always something that surprises me. Oh, yes. Please bring him back. This is good timing. I want you to meet a former student of mine. He called about a case you may find interesting. Yeah, sure. What's it about? Well, we only spoke briefly on the phone, but, in essence... Ah... Hello, Professor, thanks for seeing me. My pleasure. You've come at a good time, Bernie. This is Phil Hirschkop. He's a brilliant civil rights lawyer. Nice to meet you. So... (SIGHS) What's the problem? Well, I'm a bit stumped. The ACLU referred me to this case concerning an interracial couple that was married in D.C. They were arrested for living together in Virginia, and the judge suspended their sentence under order that they leave the state for 25 years. I filed a motion to vacate the judgment with Judge Bazile, the original trial judge in Caroline County, but he's stonewalling me. Of course, the ACLU sees this, and I agree, as a potential contender to repeal the anti-miscegenation laws nationwide. I just need to get the ball rolling, as it were. PHIL: It's a very delicate situation because by appealing, you open up the possibility of sending them both to prison. I think regardless, file the 1983 motion explaining your complaint. It'll force Bazile's hand and get you in front of a federal three-judge panel. All right. Look, I got to catch a plane to New York tonight, but I'll work up a draft and I'll find you on Monday? Great. That's just great. Thank you. Yeah. And, Bernie, if you don't mind me asking, how much experience do you have with constitutional law? Some. Very little. (CLEARS THROAT) (CHUCKLES) You realize this case could alter the constitution of the United States? I do. (CHUCKLES) I'll call you on Monday. SIDNEY: One, two, three! DONALD: I'm a good dog! MILDRED: I can never get mine to rise. It's not you. It's the humidity. Just thick. Come look, Meme. Come look. - Peggy. - She's fine. What you want from your Meme? PEGGY: Lilly won't share her tea. She must be upset. Well, she wants to sit with us out here. Momma, get Peggy inside! Bean! (PANTING) Hey. What is it? Well, I got a message for you. What? Well, that lawyer called. Said he wanna meet with y'all. MILDRED: Sidney! Donald! Raymond, why you driving so fast like that? What you mean? I always drive like that. (SIGHS) - What? - MILDRED: Richard. - What is it? - It's okay. PHIL: "Almighty God created the races white, black, "yellow, Malay, and red, and he placed them on separate continents. "And but for the interference with his arrangement "there would be no cause for such marriages. "The fact that he separated the races "shows that he did not intend for the races to mix." (CHUCKLES) I know it sounds strange, but this is really wonderful. By issuing this ruling, Judge Bazile has really given us a road map right to the Supreme Court. I'm sorry, I'm confused. He ruled against us again. That's right, but now we're allowed to appeal that ruling to the state. From there, if the state rules against you, we'll have a chance at the Supreme Court. That sounds wonderful. I have one little piece of housekeeping. LIFE magazine contacted us about sending a photographer out to you all. Keeping the possibility of the Supreme Court in mind, I think it's a fair idea that we raise the profile of your case, but I, of course, want to make sure that you are all comfortable with that. It'll be fine. Hello! Grey Villet, LIFE magazine. Pleasure. What you got there, a small block? Yeah. Yeah. What's the trouble? Carburetors. Oh. Then you're a better mechanic than me. If you rejet them, it goes faster, though, right? I'm sure you already know that. Is your wife inside? Uh-huh. Oh. Hello. Grey Villet. LIFE magazine. May I? Of course. Come in. GREY: Oh. Something smells good in there. (LAUGHTER) So, I can't go back without a photo. No photo, no job. And this is LIFE magazine and the pigeon guy isn't around. - Pigeon guy? - PEGGY: Pigeon guy? GREY: That's right. Looking up at this office building and it hits me. Right. I go 55 stories up and I talk some office girls into letting me look out the window. Before they could do anything, I throw open the window, sit on the ledge and dangle my feet out. (LAUGHS) They start screaming, but I got this great shot of my feet flying over 42nd and 5th Avenue. Yeah. So what happened? Security threw me out head first. (LAUGHING) But, LIFE magazine hired me the next day. That's a story, all right. - (LAUGHING) - PEGGY: Yeah, that's a story, all right. GREY: You go to the Virginia State Court next, right? Yes. You nervous? I suppose. Hmm. The lawyers told us not to expect much. You think you'll lose? Well, yes. But I think it's all right. We may lose the small battles, but win the big war. (PLATES CLATTER) - AUNT BEE: (ON TV) ...coleslaw. - ANDY: (ON TV) Yeah. And here's the surprise. Some of my new homemade pickles. (LAUGHING) ANDY: That certainly is a wonderful surprise. Look at that, Barney, Aunt Bee's brought us some of her homemade pickles. BARNEY: I see. Sure is wonderful. You really shouldn't have, Aunt Bee. ANDY: That's right, Aunt Bee. You go to way yonder too much trouble to please us. - (RICHARD CHUCKLES) - AUNT BEE: It's no trouble at all. There's plenty. I made eight quarts. - ANDY: Eight quarts? - (LAUGHTER) Aunt Bee made eight quarts. Eight quarts. AUNT BEE: You can have some every day. (RICHARD LAUGHS) Well, I had an awful big breakfast. I just stuffed myself something fierce. AUNT BEE: Have some pickles. Here you are. And here you are. Mr. Loving. Mr. Loving. They just wanna ask you a few questions. Uh... All right. Mrs. Loving, you rolling? Mrs. Loving, the Virginia Supreme Court just ruled against you. How do you feel about what happened here today? Well, I feel hopeful. I'm hopeful. And where will you go now? Well, I guess we'll go back to Washington. You'll go back to Washington? Mr. Loving, do you have anything to say about what went on in the court today? No. I don't have anything to say. NEWS REPORTER: Okay. Thank you, folks, very much. Did you get that? - CAMERA MAN: I think so. - NEWS REPORTER: Okay, cut, Tommy. Mr. and Mrs. Loving? We wanted you to know that, with all this travel back and forth from Virginia, you have my number and if anybody arrests you, you have them get in touch with us. We're not gonna let you spend one minute longer in jail than it takes us to get down there to get you out, okay? Okay. Good luck to you. You did a good job today. Well, I sure appreciate what y'all are doing. Okay. Well, we'll see you soon. Bye. Thank you, gentlemen. PHIL: You know they aren't going back to Washington. And there's no guarantee we can get them out if they get arrested again. Mmm-hmm. Sidney! Sidney! I want you to go next door to the neighbor. You gonna ask him to use the telephone and you gonna call Raymond and ask him to bring his gun, okay? Go. Go on now. Run through the woods. Go on. Everything okay? It's fine. Richard? Go on inside. (DOG BARKING) That truck may have just been going fishing. Could be. You ever hear from anyone at your work about it? Not to my face. Well, I'll tell you this, Rich, nobody gonna tell you what you can't do. (BEEPS) You're all set. Thank you. Who we gonna call, Momma? I don't want you calling anybody. How did that go? Doctor said she'll be fine. Just put her on aspirin. Who was that? Telephone man. Richard had him install a phone. Momma, you feel okay? MUSIEL: Yes. - You got some tea I can drink? - Mmm-hmm. All right. Testing, testing. Testing. WOMAN: What do you think you would do if you... If you lose the case? MILDRED: Well... If we lose, then we would have to go back to Washington. And how does that make you feel having to go back to Washington? (CLEARS THROAT) Mildred? Come here. - Excuse me. - Yeah. I don't want those people here. I'm done with all these cameras! Well, I think it's important. These people want to help us, Richard. Well, actually, although I'm sure the publicity isn't very pleasant, if it works out for you, it will work out for a lot of other people, too. Yes. I hope so. It's the principle. It's the law. I don't think it's right. And if... If we do win, we will be helping a lot of people. Mmm-hmm. And I knew... I know we have some enemies, but we have some friends, too. So it really don't make a difference about my enemies. Push in hard on that one. You go straight down the way, okay? I got it. I got it. Don't worry about it. - Hey. Good ride. - All right. Make sure you get it into second as quick as you can. - VIRGIL: You got it. - PERCY: All right. (ENGINE REVS) (TIRES SCREECHING) (CROWD CHEERING) Car looks good. Yeah, it's running all right. MAN: You see him driving today. It was like he was sitting in the back seat. (ALL LAUGHING) Oh, man. I miss you, Rich. Hell, I can say it. Hey, Percy, don't you miss Rich? Yeah. I miss you too, Virgil. (LAUGHTER) Man. So, what's all this you got going? - All what? - What you got. You just went made it hard now. No, no. You think I'm crazy, but you know what hard is now, don't you? Yeah. Richard, you are white. Now, you may think you're like a black man, but you're white. You hang around all these black folks, but when you go to work, you're still white. But not now. Now you know what it feels like now, don't you? You're black now, ain't you? - You're a damn fool. - All right, come on now. No, he needs to hear it. Look, every nigga in here wish they were you, Rich, and you ain't got sense enough for it. You got a fix. I ain't got no fix. So yours is easy. All you gotta do is divorce her. Divorce her? All you gotta do. (LAUGHS) - Yeah. - Yeah. Really. (BOTH LAUGH) - I'm gonna divorce her. - VIRGIL: That it. That's all you gotta do, right? That's all you gotta do. RAYMOND: Apologize now, Virgil. (CREAKS) (MUMBLING) Come to bed, Richard. We've been talking to lawyers for near 10 years now. Let's go to bed. I can take care of you. I know that. I can take care of you. (SNIFFLING) I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. MILDRED: It's okay. It's very good. Well, I have some really terrific news. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear our case. (SIGHS) PHIL: Now, of course, the state of Virginia will mount their defense, but we are feeling very good about our chances here. You've got the full weight of the ACLU behind this. (CHUCKLES) - It's a miracle. - Hmm. What's their defense? I'm sorry? Virginia. How are they gonna defend what they done to us? I guess we won't know until the hearing, but it's likely that they'll use a defense similar to something they've used before. What's that? It's your kids. Our kids? The state of Virginia will argue that it is unfair to bring children of mixed race into the world. They believe the children are bastards. Now, as the defendants in this trial, you are allowed to come and hear the arguments. No. We don't need to do that. It's a tremendous honor to sit with the Supreme Court. Very few people... No. That's fine. Excuse me. (DOOR CLOSING) Mildred? I wouldn't go without him. You know, Richard, it's, of course, up to you not to attend but, you should know, the Supreme Court only hears one out of every 400 cases. It's historic. Thank you, Mr. Cohen. Well. Is there anything you'd like me to say to them? And by "them" I mean the Supreme Court justices of the United States? Yeah. You can tell the judge... Tell the judge I love my wife. You okay to park? Thanks, Martha. SUPREME JUSTICE: Number 395. Richard Perry Loving et al, Appellants, v. Virginia. Mr. Hirschkop. Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, may it please the court? PHIL: You have before you today what we consider the most odious of the segregation laws and the slavery laws, and our view of this law, and we hope to clearly show, is that this is a slavery law. We ask that the Court consider the full spectrum of these laws and not just the criminality, because it's more than criminality that's at point here. It's the right to inherit land, the legitimacy of children, and many, many rights. WARREN: Mr. Cohen. Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court? What is the danger to the state of Virginia of interracial marriage? What is the state of danger to the people of interracial marriage? Marriage is a fundamental right.
