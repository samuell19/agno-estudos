You're making up tales again Lots of things are being made up except the Four Books Smarty pants Cousin, do you have any jade? Whatjade? Ajade like this No, l don't No? Your piece ofjade is a very precious one Of course not everybody can have it What's so precious about it ? lt can't even tell the nature of a person What's so good about it? Even l don't want it Baoyu... Baoyu, you can leash your anger on anyone But not on that piece ofjade! That's right None of the sisters got thatjade except me What's the sense in that... now the fairy-like cousin ... is here and not even she's got the jade So you can tell it's not a good thing Baoyu, put it back on and don't let your father know That's right. Be good, put it on again Look Granny, he's lost his temper again Well, well Brother Bao, come, put it back on No Cousin Lin, why are you crying? lt's all my fault, l came here and roused your anger So much that you even threw away the jade No, it's not your fault at all Okay, l'll put it back on That's the right thing to do Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu Destined to meet from afar Endless joy sprung from countless days together As the couple grew closer to each other Day and night, night and day A moment apart turns sour a heart As weak as she is He is as thoughtful as one can be Comfort comes in as the best cure The snow melts out as spring draws near Young love blooms warmly The brocade flower blooms forth putting a new colour Then arrives the new relative Xue Baochai An impressive figure to everyone low and high A banquet set and family ties reset A gift present and people's heart on her is set The maids are joyful and grateful To her they said: Miss Bao is so nice Such nice a person is Miss Bao Miss Bao is such a nice person Look, she has only just come and ... Everyone in the house speaks so well of her You're so right, Lady Matriarch They are just being too kind to her We have given you too much trouble What are you talking about? You're the dear sister to my daughter-in-law And Xifeng is your niece Aren't we all a family together? Miss Lin is here Greetings to you, Grandma Where have you two been? Grandma, the peach trees have blossomed in backyard Cousin and l have each composed two poems See, hers is much better than mine What good is it for a woman to compose a poem ? You should learn from your cousin Miss Bao ... to be more worldly Yes, Grandma Go and greet your aunt Greetings to you, aunt That'll do Look, the pair is just a perfect match, l guess l'll get to drink your wedding wine in a few years Aunt Oh please, don't make up such a joke Our Miss Lin is very sensitive lf she gets angry about this ... our Brother Bao will have to apologize to her Cousin Oh, what is it ? Did l put it in a wrong way? Xifeng Daiyu Cousin Let her go, Baoyu See, what a temper she has This child is a bit spoilt You know Granny, l've a strange story to narrate What strange story? Brother Bao, please give me yourjade And Sister Bao, give me your golden locket Take a close look Lose Not and Forget Not; Live a Long Life Leave Not and Abandon Not; Keep a youthful mind How come it sounds like an antithetical couplet? What a coincidence ! That's true l'd say it's notjust coincidence, but fate Fate or no fate; that's irrelevant This is truly ''solid love as the gold and jade'' The story spreads out fast Daiyu gets insecure lt's lucky that he is here to explain His love has not changed at all lnto the garden she walks one day She looks around at the bridge Baoyu is sitting there Reading a book and studying hard He used to flee at the sight of a book Today it's a totally different scene Why is he so different today? lt makes me wonder a lot Baoyu Cousin Lin, what do you have in your hand? Alright, so you're the one to ask first lt's the broom and container for flowers What are they for? You see, the flowers have fallen all over the place And have been pitifully trampled on by everybody With the broom l'll rake up the flowers Gather them in this container And bury them Good idea, let me help you with it Saga of the Western Cabin l thought you've changed and studying hard So you're actually reading this My good cousin, it's okay that you know But please don't tell anyone about it lt's actually very well written lf you read it, you'll forget even dinner Don't talk nonsense Take a look if you don't believe me Sit down and read How is it? ls it well written? lt's good, but too bold lf it's not that bold ... How can it express the passion? Hey Lin, take a look Love is known even to heaven and earth And tenderness is seen among plants The butterflies are known to be in pairs And the flower buds intertwine, too The fish swim in pairs While the birds play together Mr. Zhang gets sick because of love And Miss Cui comes to see him at night How smart is the matchmaker How very smart is she My dear Lin, l'm like Mr. Zhang And you are like Miss Cui We'll swear our love upon the Stone of Love We don't even need the matchmaker God, you've got a naughty tongue You abuse me with your naughty words All day long you read those indecent books lt makes your thoughts go astray Just wait, l'll report you to your father And let him give you a good beating Good Cousin, please forgive me You must forgive me this time lt's just because l've read a good book And it's got stuck in my mind lf l do abuse you intentionally l will... What ? l may fall in the pond ... And turn into a monster So, Mr. Zhang has the guts to ask for her hand And Miss Cui dares to see him at night l thought you are as bold as them But instead you turn out to be a chicken A big chicken indeed Cousin Lin, Cousin Lin May you live as long as the sky and earth May luck and prosperity pile up at your door Kowtow Again And again Arise First Master is here Take a seat over there The couple is here to wish The Lady happy birthday Mother, may you live long Kowtow Again And again Rise This way please Master Lian and his wife wish The Lady happy birthday Your son is here to wish you long life and prosperity Kowtow Get up, get up The granddaughters are here Yingchun, come to say your greetings Granddaughter is here to wish you long life Kowtow Get up, they are all over there Come on, go sit with them Come, say your birthday greetings to Madam Forget it How can you say that?

What are you looking for? l've lost my ring What kind of ring is it? Hemmed with jade. lt ain't worth much though But it's a gift from Lady Wang From Lady Wang? l'm so careless ! Xiren, what do you think about this? lt's better than mine You think they look alike? Almost the same Then take it l can't do that Don't worry. Come, l'll put it on for you Miss Bao, you're so nice You can't imagine how important this is to me ! How would l not know The ring that you lost ... is the token of your marriage to Baoyu Right ? Who told you that? Though Lady Wang did try not to let the word out The news can't escape Lady Lian Ever since l learnt of the news l want to congratulate you in person What's there to congratulate? Fate of a maid is bitter The best is to become a mistress But in case she can't get along with the wife ... She still has to suffer Who won't get along with... such a nice person as you? That's hard to tell lf Master Bao marries a nice woman as you Xiren lf she is as nice as you, then l'm in luck However, if she's like Miss Lin ... Then no matter how skillful l am; l can't handle it Okay, okay, now come with me to see Grandma Master Bao Jinchuan What's the matter? Did you see Miss Lin? Miss Lin ? Yes Did you see her ? Where is she? l'm not telling you Then l won't let you go My advice to you is to take things easy Why choose a thorny path when there's a paved road What do you mean by that? All l'm saying is, it'll be hard for you and Miss Lin! How can you tell ? Even if the old ones agree, the big ones won't And say, if the big ones agree, not the small ones What kind of nonsense is this? Who're the old ones? And who're the big ones? And who are the small ones? The more l say, it'd look like l made up the gossip That won't do You have to tell the truth today My good Master, please let me go The Lady is waiting for the dessert l won't let you go unless you tell me Master Bao, please give it back to me! l'll be blamed if l get late No way, unless you tell me Give it to me Then tell me Jinchuan Lady You shameless slut Mom Stay out of this From a shameless low woman as you, has Baoyu ... learnt all the enticing Come here Yes Take her back to her mom People like her can't stay here Don't be afraid, Jinchuan Mom, don't kick her out lt's all my fault, not hers She did nothing wrong Lady, l beg you Please don't kick me out Shut up Lady, l'm at fault You can beat me up or scold me But please don't kick me out Lady, please l beg you, please Nonsense Mom, don't get mad, l beg you too Lady, please don't kick me out Mom, please forgive her! Lady, please don't kick me out lf l leave here in such an ambiguous way ... How can l face the outside world? Take her out Lady, please don't kick me out Jinchuan What do you want? Come with me l'm not going... She jumped into the well ! You good-for-nothing Tell me about last night What did you do with Jinchuan ? Nothing Nothing? Then why would she commit suicide? Such an unfilial lackey like you You never study hard But to spend all your efforts on women Now you even cost someone her life Father, l did not do anything And you even try to deny. lf the word spreads ... you'll shame us all, even the ancestors From a useless descendent like you ... what goodness can one expect ? l'll beat you to death today. Men ... Yes Give this fellow a good thrashing Dad, l didn't do it Give him a hard, good beating Yes Go on l'm afraid Master Bao can't stand it anymore Shut up. l won't take your life even if he's killed Just beat him up Yes Stop Don't get into this. He's been spoiled by you all What wrong with you ? Who has spoiled him? Mother, you've come. Take a seat l won't sit Mom, you just need to ask for me ... if you need anything You don't need to come here in person l've come to have a word with you lt's a pity that in this life of mine ... l couldn't have a good son Who should l turn to? Mom, your words are too harsh for me How can l bear it? Oh, you can't bear even a few words? So how can Baoyu bear the hard beatings ... by that thick cane ? Grandma Baoyu, why don't you behave well You have done wrong Mom, l'm wrong You can beat me or scold me But please don't go into rage How can l ? The beating is too hard, way too hard The whole house is in turmoil Xifeng is here bandaging And there goes Baochai with the medicine The beating is equally hard on old grandma ... who has doted on Baoyu She's so furious that she kept scolding her son All is well by evening when everybody left And there comes Daiyu the lover Baoyu... Cousin Lin Have a seat You...it must be hard for you l'm okay, don't cry l've just applied medicine, it's doesn't hurt anymore You... You are so good to me, l'll be happy even if ...l have to die; not to mention just some beatings Who asked you to say such a thing? Please be good from now on, okay From now on? So even you do not trust me? Although l'm a bit wild But l'm very serious with my love and my heart lf you don't trust me Then all my love for you ... has become meaningless And the heart you have for me ... will also be wasted Do you still remember this? Plum flower We had an argument that year You used that to wipe my tears lt's been three years and you still keep it As long as it's from you Not to say three years, but even thirty Or three hundred years, or after l'm dead And been turned into ashes And the ashes are blown away by the wind But all of this ... will still be with me All this talk again So do you believe me? Please behave Cousin Lin Take a good rest, l'll see you tomorrow The sound of bell heralds the arrival of night But l'm so delighted l can't sleep well l've known Cousin for three years And still, there is something hard to express l thought she'd be cold towards me But actually, her heart is warmer than l thought The moon is up when the poem is done l'm happy and yet a little fearful Happy for having such a devoted love And yet afraid that this love won't be allowed l hope that God will help us And let us fulfill our love May the moon be the witness to our hearts Our love is so true that even ... Heaven will be moved And the moon will be pitiful Heaven will be thrilled to know what love is The moon will always be full if it knows no regret Dancing in front of the White Jade Hall Embraced by the spring breeze The bees and the butterflies come around And follow not the flowing river Regret not ... for what we cannot change We will follow our fate And laugh not as if we have nowhere to return l wish the wind will come around And to the sky send me afar Very good, ''wishing the wind will come around'' ''And to the sky send me afar'' Cousin Lin, when did you come? l just came, and saw that you're dancing ... and reciting couplets. What a lovely scene ! How skillful is your tongue Good at mocking people l'm not mocking you l'm actually happy for you... About what? l heard that your name was sent in to the palace May the Emperor bestow his favour on you So that you can become an imperial concubine Just like Yuanchun By then, it's truly sent by the good wind And up to the sky Good for you, little girl See if l'll forgive you Good sister, please forgive me, l won't dare again You have more forgiveness to beg for What else? l should have questioned you long ago Question me? Let me ask you this; last month ... When we were discussing poetry What did you say? What did l say? You said ''The woman calls from inside the curtain'' Where does this line come from? So a shy lady that never goes out ... does secretly read those indecent novels Sister Bao Trust me, l only glanced through it once Please keep it a secret Don't worry, l'm not that sort You are actually very talented And l admire you a lot But what's the use of that? Ancient wisdom has it That''devoid of talent is a virtue for woman'' To be born female We are destined to do only the homely affairs Not to say education But even if you are very talented You can't be a high official And sometimes if you read too much ... and go to the extreme, that's even worse, right? Yes Miss Bao, Miss Lin So you both are here The house is bustling with excitement today Yuanchun concubine has sent us many gifts Everyone in the family got his share She is so nice to us all l've something else to tell you A while back Lady Lian was telling a joke Whatjoke? Amongst the gifts that have been sent lt's such a coincidence that those for Miss Lin & ... Second and Third Sisters are all the same While the one for Miss Bao ... is the same as Master Bao So Lady Lian remarked that Yuanchun concubine ... must be very good at fortune telling She knew about that incident of Jade & Locket ... going around in our place; So she matches you up with Master Bao Miss Lin Cousin Lin, Cousin Lin Perhaps l must have uttered something wrong Miss Lin is getting very sensitive again Maybe not, don't make any blind guesses anymore ls Brother Bao getting any better? Yes, and Master is pushing him to school again He is now studying at his own house Don't go, you can't really escape Come, let me do it Come, come on! My good lord, please don't fool me anymore You've made my eyebrow ... just like Miss Lin lf Lady sees this ... She will blame me again What's wrong about looking like Miss Lin? That's true l don't know who makes up the gossips And said to Lady Wang that l've put on too much make-up Also that l intend to entice you; lsn't that sheer nonsense ? They blame you girls for whatever happens. lsn't it... bad enough that Jinchuan has committed suicide? Since you understand ... then please be considerate towards us! Don't fool around And concentrate on your studies No way Please, my good lord After you finish studying, you can mix my rouge Good, let me mix it now Not now, l haven't bought it yet l don't believe you What's that on your face if not rouge ? This is the little bit left behind from last night Then give me that little bit Qingwen, come on No Qingwen Miss Bao is here Go wipe your face clean l'm so impressed by you, Qingwen You're supposed to serve Master Bao to study And you're playing with him instead Look, how can l leave this house for one minute Of course, you're the only smart one here Only you are qualified to serve Master Bao So you're picking on me instead? Oh, how would l dare We're born to slave around How can we compare with you You're half a master by fate Just so you wait The crow will soon fly to the flock of Phoenix You... Don't get mad, take it easy Miss Bao, you can tell how hard it is for me l've to obey all the Masters and Ladies And l've to be careful with the maids of the house And this our Master Bao He won't be more considerate no matter what l said Okay, okay, it's all my fault l'm not asking for an apology lf you're really considerate, you should study hard You don't understand, it's not that l hate studying But there are so many good books in this world Why should we stick to the Eight-Part Essay Even if l've studied all of it l'd be no more than a vain, brainless official Look at him, whenever we talk of studying ... he mentions about rain Not rain, but brain He is suggesting that the hard-working students ... are just like a book-worm So after all it's Cousin Bao that understands me Don't be glad yet. l'm not saying you're right The Eight-Part Essay is vital for you to get into ... high positions in the government All we can hope for in this life is fame and wealth You're not a child anymore You can't fool around with us all day long You should know that ... you're the only hope of this family Great, what a great way of thinking l've always thought that fame and wealth ... exist only among men So now even the women ... are concerned about it all And even someone as pure as Miss Bao ... would say something like this lt proves that vanity does spread like poison lt will harm even the purest elements of the earth Master Bao, how can you say that? Don't you fear that it will hurt Miss Bao? lt's not his fault, l should've put it in a nice way See, Miss Bao is Miss Bao You know, had it been Miss Lin ... l can't imagine how terrible it will turn out ! Miss Lin would never shoot her mouth off like that Listen, all she said is wise sayings of the world And he calls that nonsense Okay, l need to get going No hurry. l've prepared a feast Stay for dinner No, thanks Don't be shy, Master Bao has just recovered Let's make the dinner a celebration for him That's too much. Let's just gather for a drink And later on l'll teach you a game See, only that can make him happy Come, have a seat inside To visit him despite the heavy fog To visit him despite the late cold night All because of his sincerity, all because of ... the handkerchief that shows his love Don't deny it. You have to drink it as promised Please Come on, another round Drink it l don't care Miss Whoever she is She shouldn't stay this late Who is it? lt's me Everybody is asleep, come again tomorrow lt's me l don't care who you are. Master Bao said ... not even the Emperor can come in When l have lost his heart l lost also the respect of the maid Oh... Wretched me, being all alone in here Being met with a grim & cold eye here Blown away like withered flowers Who'd sympathise with a lady devoid of her rosyness All the year round The cold has come around What is left is only bones in an urn Covered by the clean soil The chaste body should return clean to the earth Never should it fall into the dirt l am being laughed at burying the flowers But who will bury me in return ! Cousin Cousin Lin, why are you crying again? l am not Look, the tears are still on your face lt seems as if you're about to meet your death l'm too involved to care about living or not And why may l ask ... You haven't spoken to me these past few days ? Then why did you forbid the maid ... to let me in the other day? God forbid, if l've done that ... l'll drop dead right away in front of you No more cursing As long as you believe me, that's good enough When l return home ... l'll check to see who was that audacious l'll teach her a good lesson That's for sure While it doesn't matter to offend me But if it's for Miss Bao or Miss Bei Then it could get serious Don't you worry too much Worry about what? You truly don't understand me? l'm a bit vague and l won't believe lt's all because you're so concerned That you've made yourself so weak lt all adds up till this day Come on, l've been weak ever as a child And that has nothing to do with you Don't you try to cover that up l know your heart so well Don't you fear, don't you worry My heart is all with you l miss you more and more each day that the thoughts ... have turned into a severe sickness l can only recover if your health is restored lf you are very sick then l can't live long Cousin Lin Baoyu What l see is stunning ! Only now do l know they are actually lovers The Lady has chosen me as the mistress And l'd like Baochai to be the wife How can l let this happen ?! l'll surely tell Lady Wang ls it true? Did you see it with your very own eyes? Yes, l did. l dare not lie Okay, you can get up Lady, do you think it's better to... To what? l mean Miss Bao is your niece So if we can cement old ties by marriage, then... Don't you rush things Miss Lin is also Lady Matriarch's granddaughter Just in case... Yes, Lady l know what to do, you can go now Yes Lightly do l play Softness is the way The way of the song of sorrow The means to end my plight The plants are touched And the insects weep But my feeble body can never stand this apathy Lack of interest from a man's heart Miss Lin, please take the medicine Been having it all day long l've had enough of this smell Miss Lin, please take care of your health That's enough. Starting from tomorrow Throw away all the medicines in the house Lately, Miss Lin is in a bad temper lt's all because of Master Bao Because of him? You know how it is with Master Bao You can never tell if he is sincere So it must be confusing for Miss Lin l think Master Bao truly loves Miss Lin lf so Why doesn't he talk to Lady Matriarch ... about their marriage? About getting married ... Master Bao will never get around to that lt's okay if he hasn't thought about it yet But l'm just worried if he is playing dumb Don't wrong him yet Let's test him tomorrow By then l'll know for sure if he's sincere or not Zijuan Good morning, Master Bao ls Miss Lin out of bed yet ? She got up early and went to greet the Lady Matriarch Master Bao, l want to ask you something Yes ? This morning the Lady Matriarch ... Has sent someone to bring us birds nest That's because l spoke to her about it last night No wonder ! l knew it must be you l hear the birds nest is very nutritious lf Cousin would take it for a few months ... it'd be very good for her health That's true But birds nest is so expensive lf she gets used to that now ... how will she be able to afford it ... when she returns home later on? Who is returning home? Miss Lin is returning to her home in Suzhou You're fooling me again Cousin Lin's parents passed away long ago To whom would she return to ? Don't you look down on her Even though her parents are dead But she's still got her uncles Even so, our Lady Matriarch won't let her go That's hard to tell After all, she belongs to the Lin family How can she spend her whole life ... in our Jia's family? And besides, in the past she used to be a little girl ... and it's true Madam doted on her; lt doesn't matter to keep her for a year or two Now she has grown up, and is ready for marriage ... How can Lady Matriarch still keep her ... when Miss Lin has to get married ? Wouldn't she let her go ? Master Bao, are you okay? Baoyu... Baoyu is not getting any better at all Baoyu, wake up Xiren Lady Matriarch How did you serve him Why has be become like this ? Ma'am, l have nothing to do with this l don't know what Zijuan told him Master Bao fainted after speaking to her So it's you, little tramp What did you tell him? l didn't tell him anything You did not? lf so, why is his condition like this ? l justjoked with him Mother ... Baoyu, how are you? Brother Bao, how are you? They can't take away Cousin Lin No one is taking Cousin Lin away Who said someone will take her away? Zijuan said thatjust now What did you tell him? l was justjoking with him l said Miss Lin has to return home to Suzhou And Master Bao... So it's nothing important after all lt was just a prank, you see Why get so serious about it? Ma'am, Nanny Lin is here to see Master Bao Okay, let her in What? They're here to take away Cousin Lin? No way, kick them out Kick them out Brother Bao Good boy, they are all gone. Don't you worry No one will come to take her away No one will come to take your dear Lin away Don't worry, no one is taking her away No one else can be named Lin except Cousin Lin Okay, no one can be named Lin Do you hear that, no one can be named Lin Take a rest What happened to Master Bao? Baoyu's sickness is really very strange How did he become as sick as this ? Mother, since by now you'd have realised Then l dare to tell you this Baoyu and Miss Lin are grown ups now And they have matured So there's something going on between them? You can see how ill Baoyu is Doesn't Miss Lin get better or worse ... now and again ? Lady Matriarch, l'd say that ... Brother Bao is still a kid But Miss Lin has been perceptive since very young lf something's really going on between them ... it's her who would have started it lf that's true, then l've loved her in vain Alright, it's no use getting mad about it We need to come up with a solution soon Let's get him into marriage earlier So as to avoid any unpleasant surprises later on What's more, a joyful event may cure his sickness That could be a solution Lady Matriarch, if you do agree ... To let Brother Bao get married; The best person is not far away You mean... Ajade and a locket How could you forget that ? Oh, Miss Bao ! l do have an objective reason for that suggestion You just need to put them together to compare Let's say health Miss Bao is much stronger than Miss Lin Sure, Miss Lin is like a candle in the wind That's true, getting sick every other day Baochai looks a lot more fortunate than Daiyu That's it. Being fortunate is most important ... for a family like us when getting a daughter-in-law Okay, since you all agree Then let's get it going You can depend on me when it comes to wedding You don't have to worry a bit Maybe we should get Miss Lin into marriage first Of course Baoyu should get married first Just in case Miss Lin realizes that ... Baoyu is marrying Miss Bao You never know what she will do ! Just don't let her know But not even Baoyu will agree to that ... if he comes to know That's true l do have an idea though l just don't know if you will agree to it Pray tell us There's only one way of doing this: substitution What? Substitution? Come here, all of you l've got a piece of good news to relay What happened? Master Bao is getting married With whom? With Miss Bao No way Why not? Couldn't be wrong. l saw it with my very own eyes A big red wedding cart is coming into our house Hey you So it's you... almost scared me ! Little Fool, why are you so happy? Bei-ming, how come you're here? Master Bao is sick. l've brought him something to eat Everyone in the house is so busy and excited today What is happening? There will be a wedding Wedding? For whom? Master Bao is getting married With whom? Miss Bao No way. l know him well lf he gets married, it'd be to Miss Lin Heard it with my very own ears; it's Miss Bao Miss Lin Miss Bao Miss Lin Miss Bao Miss Lin Miss Bao...

Since her death ... the bird just wouldn't eat; And has given up its life at her picture Zijuan every work like a dagger into my heart l can never come out from this deep grief My dearest Lin We couldn't get married in this life Let us meet and marry in the next life Oh Lin, l've been so wrong My dearest Lin Master Bao, it's time to return Yes, it's time to go back lt really is my time to return Pitifully full of meeting and parting is this life lnto Buddhism can we sense where we're from Even the Gods can't bear the pain of separation And not even a goddess can remedy a love lost Countless number of lovers ... have set their hope for the next life Life is full of regrets; Looking back ... lt's nothing butjust a dream !
