She's asleep... For your information, the ball should go above the net. All right, Jeremy, lay off. Your turn, Arnaud. l'm out of hot water. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Thanks for yesterday. lt was nice to lend us your room. My folks are never there in the evening. And l fell asleep watching TV. Hi. Where is Jeremy? He's at his place. He's grounded: he failed his year. What's up Van? What's up with you? We're off. Where's Guillaume? No idea. He's been gone 15 minutes. l'm bored. Well, this is Aude. Lucas. Hi. - And Vanessa. - Hi She's Guillaume's girlfriend. Want anything to drink? l'm OK. l'll have a Malibu and pineapple drink. Shit, it didn't look that far. Why did Van leave like that? We were looking for you. She thought you had left. What about you, did you meet a girl? Aude. She's in Junior High. How old is she? Dunno. Sixteen maybe? She repeated a year. Cool. Can l trust you with a secret? My mum's in the hospital again. lt's cool for her students. She won't have bored them too long this year. Wanna come back to my place? l can't. l have to go to Yannick's. l'll walk you. l'm not sleepy yet. You're going to have to speak up. lt's not at the age of sixteen you'll be ruling my school or your house. l'll leave the two of you alone. - l was with Guillaume. - Guillaume? We went out clubbing, and we went back to his place. - Why didn't you call me? - You wouldn't have let me. His mum's in the hospital. He wanted me to stay with him. The two of you could have come back to the house. No. He needs to go home to his tutor. Tutor? His mum is losing it since her husband killed himself. Does dad know for last night? No. l didn't mention anything. l got to go back. Guillaume! - How are you? - How about you? Guillaume, the principal wants to see you. - What does she want this time? - How should l know? l've got detention on Saturday. Yeah... No not really. l'm at the hospital. My mum lost her shit again. No, forget it. Yeah. Wait, Arnaud. l got to go. Call you later. Guillaume... You all right? Holding up? lt's not the first time. Why don't you want me to go home? l'm used to this. Sure. l've also got some responsibilities. Can't leave you on your own. Do you know mothers who leave their kids in foster homes? l know some. Stop! Why doesn't he call? He asked me to tell you, it's the same. He doesn't give a shit. Give it a break. He's got problems right now. Whatever. l'm out of here. Bye. She really doesn't get it. She loves him. lt's more like she wants to get laid. What are you doing? l'm sick of it. You don't like anything, you never touch me, never hold my hand. l'm not talking about kissing. l don't like doing it in the street. lt looks stupid. Why? l dunno. Well. Fuck that. Little virgins like you piss me off. l'm outta here. l try to see things in a bright light, but a veil covers it. The darkened thoughts that my future imposes upon me, help me hope that after darkness falls the sun will rise again. l know it's time for me to find joy, forget my sorrows and find the words to see the light. l am the one who... - lt's me. - Hi. l can't sleep, and l'm bored as hell. l called Van, we got in a fight. lt's over. She's too much to deal with. l've got enough to worry about. Can l put this louder? Got anything to drink? l'll be right back. l can still hear your voice. The images blur but the sorrow remains the worst possible enemy down here but all except a slight detail, a wide emptiness forgives my excesses, but one little detail remains. You're done? Yeah. - You got any clean clothes? - Check in the bedroom. Shit, l haven't fucked in ages. ls that all you think about? Guillaume, l saw Van at lunch break. You got ditched, eh? That sucks. Van's pretty hot. lt's not totally over either. Why do you say that? l dunno. Here. Don't worry. The ladies always come running back. lt's hormonal, they itch for it. Your girl, Arnaud! Forget it. We're not together anymore. Hi, Aude! You're mad or something? You don't come and say hi. You're stupid, she's pretty hot. - l wouldn't have let her go. - That's my business. - l'll give Van a call. - Suit yourself. lf you like jerks. Are you kidding? She's a knock-out. Watch your mouth, man. - You see me when you're in trouble. - l don't give a shit about you. Go and find your Van. l don't give a shit about you, or your problems. l'm outta here. Arnaud? Arnaud. Calm down. Quiet. l can't. Quiet. Quiet, there. Hi. Hi. Thanks for coming. How are you? All right, l guess. l'm sick of this shit. What's wrong? l'm off. Guillaume... Wait... Hello, Yannick Vlimant. - You're Arnaud's mother? - Yes. - Do you want anything to drink? - Yes, please. With this heat. Please... - Could l have a mint soda? - Mint soda? Thank you. Arnaud must have explained the situation. l've spoken about it with my husband, there's no problem. - The kids get along well. - That's true. Guillaume's mother knows about this. She won't be out of the hospital for a couple of months, and l need to leave for the next four weeks. Guillaume asked to stay with you. What about the foster home? lt's not necessary to get into the massive paperork. l'm the one responsible for Guillaume and... l'm sure he'll be fine with you. l think so too. - The financial aspect... - That's fine. - But... - That's fine, really. Arnaud is happy to have Guillaume come over for a few days. l love you. l'm hard. l know. - Would you blow me? - Again? Arnaud! ls anybody home? Stop. Stop. Hi, guys, l'll take the winner. Finally we can get down to business. lt's cool to be here. We need to go back tonight. Jeremy has a date. - With who? - A girl he met at the pool. Another one? How about you, guys? Are you staying long? l don't know. l've been waiting for this all day. l think they're onto something. No. Even my folks don't suspect anything. You're sure? Yeah, and l don't care. You know, sometimes l feel as if l were in a dream. You? l don't know. l love you too. l love you as if you were a girl. Why do you say that? You would have been nice as a girl. Hi. Hi. Did l wake you? Yeah... Sorry. Are you alone? Can l stay a while? lf you want to. My name is Arnaud. Subtitles by B. Badier Subtitling by CEDRA PRODUCTlONS
