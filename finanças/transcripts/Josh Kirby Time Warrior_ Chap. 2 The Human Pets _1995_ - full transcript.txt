(MultiCom Jingle) (explosions) (alarm clock rings) (dramatic music) - [Josh] My name is Josh Kirby. I was just your average ninth grader, my biggest problem was getting good grades. And my idea of excitement was racing my bicycle. (bell rings) Yes! I never thought time would catch up with me. I couldn't even imagine that hundreds of years from now, many kind would invent the Nullifier. A device capable of controlling, or destroying the universe. - [Zoetrope] Prepare for the storm. - [Josh] A scientist name Erwin 1138 tried to disassemble and hide the Nullifier. Even he he couldn't stop, - [Irwin] Dr Zoetrope? - [Zoetrope] Give me the Nullifier. - [Irwin] You're too late, Zoetrope. - [Zoetrope] It's never too late for me. - [Josh] Irwin and Zoetrope have been chasing each other across the time stream, trying to be the first to find the Nullifier's pieces. This time, they will land in 1995. The place? My front yard. Now, I'm going along for the ride of all time. What's going on? Where are we? - [Irwin] I hope you're prepared to do battle young man. This will be a war through time, and Dr Zoetrope will take no prisoners. (dramatic music) - [Josh] We've got help from a warrior. - My name is Azabeth Siege. - Oh, she's amazing. And a magical creature called Prism to show us the way. Together, we're on a quest through time. Visiting different worlds to fight for the Nullifier's pieces. - [Zoetrope] I'm obviously in the right place. And the right time. - [Josh] Because if Zoetrope ever assembles the Nullifier, he'll conquer time it's self. I've got to try and save the universe. (dramatic music) I was just a 14 year old kid before my adventure began. But now, I'm Josh Kirby, Time Warrior. - [Announcer] On the last chapter of Josh Kirby, Time Warrior. (yelling) - Look mister, I've got to get out of here. - Such petty concerns. I've got to catch Zoetrope before it's too late. Location is, England. 1205 AD. You think they mean us harm? - I'd say that's pretty much an affirmative. - It's a dinosaur. - I think it thinks we're lunch. - We must rescue them. - Who are you guys? - I might ask you the same question. (smack) - Azabeth. - No, we must run now boy, or we are lost too. - Take her. - New comers, Lord? - Yes, three of them. I have one imprisoned in the dungeon right now. - We got to organize another rescue pronto. - Rescue? Out of the question. - I know where there's another dragon. - [Josh] Another dragon, are you serious? - It followed you, Josh. - [Josh] Maybe now you'll consider my other idea. - We should launch an assault against the castle and my brother with the aide of this creature? - We could take 'em. I know we could. - Are you with me in a push against the castle? (crowd clamors agreement) (dramatic music) - Guards! Guards! Court yard, you idiots. (dramatic music) (sword clanks) - Return her to the dungeon. (struggling) Wake the royal executioner. She dies on the chopping block in the morning. - [Guard] Why not feed her to the royal dragon, sire? - What? And deny myself the trophy of her head? You see, this is why I'm a Barron, and you're an idiot. Besides, come tomorrow the royal dragon can fest on all the peasant villager he likes. After her execution, we sack the village. No more Mr Nice Knight. (grunting) (door clangs shut) - Try the left. (laughter) And try the right. (metal groans) Excellent. Time pod in full working order. - Great. Now I'll see you later. I got to talk to William about something. - Oh, alright. (singing to self) (sighs) (light music) - Sire, it's me, Josh. (door squeaks open) - Sire now, is it? I'm glad you've come, Josh Kirby. I want to tank you. - For what? - Modest as well as brave, eh? I think you know what for. I was practically a broken man before you came. You've given us all new hope, - Well actually I came here to ask you a favor. - Anything in my power, lad. - I need a sword for tomorrow. And a few lessons. - Tomorrows battle is not yours, Josh. We can not ask you to fight it for us. - Yeah but I want too. Our friend is still your brother's prisoner, remember? (sorrowful music) - Alright. - It's yours. - And now yours. Take it. (uplifting music) Feels good, doesn't it? - Yeah, real D&D. - What? - D&D. Dungeons and Dragons? - Dungeons, dragons? - Skip it. - That sword was forged in the time of the Vikings, and handed down in my family for generations. From eldest son to eldest son. Henry hated my father for giving it to me. The Norsemen gave their weapons names in those days. You're holding Salvation of the Realm in your hands. Appropriate, wouldn't you say? Now. Come at me with your blade. Oh my. Again. The other way. (upbeat music) Oh dear. And again. Oh, are you sure you've never used a broad sword before? You seem to have a flare for this, Josh Kirby. Yes, quite a flare. Very interesting maneuver, that. (solemn music) - Feels good. Familiar somehow. Like I've done this before. - In another life perhaps. Just a word of caution. You have a stomach for the site of blood? - Blood? - I thought not. Many's the knight who's been unmanned after drawing the blood of his enemy. Some even give up their breakfasts, if you take my meaning. So, if you don't have the stomach for carnage, strike to dull the senses. A blow to the skull with the flat of your blade is enough to take any man out of the fray. - I got it. - Troops assembled to go over the plan of attack, sire. - Good. I've drawn a map of the castle for us. (roaring) - Who's there? - Shh, quite. You'll wake the jailer. (door creaks) Are you quite alright? - How do I look? What do you want? - I just came to see if they hurt you. - I am fine. No thanks to you. Oh, but you can go now. You've done your good turn for the day. - Oh, I'm sorry Azabeth. But I can do no more. - Yes you can. - What? - Help me. Free me. - Free you? Are you mad? Henry would have my head on a pike. - And he's to have mine in the morning. (sorrowful music) - I knew not of this. - You are a slave, you know. As much as slave as I ever was on my own world. - What is this, your own world? - Never mind. - Ha, how am I a slave? I come as I please. I go as I please. I own many beautiful things. - And you are a beautiful thing, own yourself. Jennifer, don't you see? You belong to Lord Henry, and all you own belongs to Lord Henry. You mean no more to him than one of his horses. You are his kept toy and nothing more. And the pity of it is, you have a choice. There's a saying where I come from. The worse prisons are the ones we make for ourselves. - Yes. Another of your Codes of Kong. - Kang, Codes of Kang. The 16th to be exact. - Yes well, I can not free you. That would be suicide for me. But I can do this much. I will get a message to your friends in the village this evening. And tell them that you're to die tomorrow, and they must come. Oh yes, I must do this on my own though. I can not trust anybody here. - Thank you. But I must ask one last favor. - What? - My weapons, I need them. Can you bring them to me? - Well not tonight. I will think of something, yes. I must go now if I'm to reach your friends in time. Good night, Azabeth. (door creaks) - Good night. - Henry's dragon guards the castle's right flank. And the castle's other battlements have guards a plenty. - How do we get in then? - A secret way, blacksmith. A way known only to myself. And now to the rest of you. Travel east along the Moors of Blackwater, till you reach the sheer rock face of Killbourn cliff. There you will find a passageway covered by brush. This leads to a secret entrance inside the castle's stables. Once inside make your way to the castle's main entrance, and throw open the gates. Gwen, you and the rest will wait with me outside the of castle in Shepard's Field. - We'll be ready. - We advance on Theodore's signal. - How wide is this passage, sire? Big enough for Theodore, I hope. (laughter) - Yes it's big enough round for Theodore. Now listen lads, once inside the castle I will ride against my brother and his dragon atop our own great beast. I was always the victor in the joust against Henry. And I ought to be able to make quick work of him. That's the plan, lads. We march at dawn. To tomorrow. And victory. (uplifting music) - [All] To victory! (fast paced music) (laughing and jeering) - Hello Jennifer. - Hello Jack. - How you've been? - Well, thank you. - Can't a man get any rest? Who's this? - I being a message from Azabeth Siege. - I know no Azabeth Siege. - We do. She's our friend. She's the one your brother captured this morning. So what's the message? How is she? Where is she? - She's being held in Lord Henry's dungeon. - Is she alright? - For the moment. Henry has ordered her execution at dawn. - Oh. - She asked for her weapons, and your help. - And who might you be? - I am the lady. I am Jennifer. I am Henry of Dearborn's concubine. - Well, Henry's concubine. You've taken a great risk coming here. We could hold you for ransom you know. - I'm none too valuable to the Barron, as I have only recently come to realize. I'm afraid I would net you precious little. (sorrowful music) - Jennifer? Here. It's Azabeth's silver piece. Just tell her we'll be there, and tell her not to worry. - You must be Josh. I'll tell her. - Jennifer, could I inquire? Is the Barron's alchemist a tall, dark, brooding man, with a little, creature that follows him wherever he goes? - Yes, the royal alchemist Zoetrope is such a man. Why do you ask? - Oh no particular reason, we just have an old score to settle, that's all. Thank you for the information. - Be on guard, all. Henry plans to march on your village after the execution at dawn. He and his men will be armed and ready for battle well before sun up. - Thank you, Jennifer. See that she has safe passage back to the castle. - I wish not for your thanks, sire. For I will do what I can on the morrow. I have much to atone for. Perhaps when all this is over. - You'll be welcome. - Good luck. (roaring) (dramatic music) - It looks a bit narrow in there. Perhaps I'd best go with the others. - Get going, Theodore. You're holding up the party. (dramatic music) - It is time, my child. (sorrowful music) (heavy sigh) (dramatic music) - Is that meant for us? - There, the Lady Jennifer. - Let's not keep the lady waiting, gents. - Well you won't get me on that thing. Alright, you go ahead and I'll see you inside. - Alright, be careful. (dramatic music) (drum in background) (people chatting and whispering in background) - Come on, get up. Get up. They want us in the square. (chickens clucking) (dramatic music) - Have you anything to say before you meet your maker? Careful how you answer, Azabeth Siege. It's not too late to show me the gratitude you denied me last night. (people whispering in background) (dramatic music) - You're just a glutton for gratitude, aren't you? - Let the execution begin. (dramatic music) - Yes, that's it Josh. - Thank you, Jennifer. Oh no, that's Azabeth. - Suite yourself. - Lend me your sling shot. - What? (people whispering in background) - Don't move. (dramatic music) (screams) - Oh Azabeth. (uplifting music) (dramatic music) (screams) (dramatic music) - Attack! (yelling) (swords clang) (dramatic music) - Attack! - Attack, attack! - Attack! (clamoring and yelling) Attack! (swords clang and clash) (punches landing) (fighters yelling) (punches landing) (swords clang and clash) (yelling fiercely) (punches landing) (horse neighs) (yelling savagely) - What took you so long? - Oh you're very welcome. - Seriously, thank you for the rescue. It seems once again I'm in your debt. - And you can't leave my side until it's repaid. The old 12th code of Kangaroonie. - Don't rub it in. (yells viciously) (dragons roar) (dramatic music) (swords clanging in background) (roars) (dramatic music) (dragons roar) (smacks) - What will you fight with now, brother? - Bare skin if it comes to that. Brother. (growls) (smacks) (roars in pain) (roars in pain) (sorrowful music) - Damn. (swords clanging in background) - What is that? (yelling out fiercely) - Josh Kirby. (giggles) (poof) (chirping) (poof) - Fight on brothers. The day's almost ours. (swords clanging) - It was you Lady, wasn't it who dropped the rope ladder down to the enemy? - No you're mistaken. Stop, I-- (dramatic music) (soft music) Jack? (dramatic music) (yelling and clashing) (laser shot) (laser shot) (dramatic music) - Azabeth Siege, you're alive. I'm so pleased. - Where have you been? - Have you seen Dr Zoetrope? Now, we understand that he's the Barron's alchemist. And he has little Prism under some kind of spell. (poof) (trills) Prism. Well this is getting to be some kind of reunion. What's that you have there, my little friend? (chirping and trilling) Oh, well done Prism. Now what about the Nullifier component that was sent into this time? Is it near? (squeaks) (dramatic music) (chickens clucking) - Excuse me. I think those are mine, baby brother. - Then take them back. Just try. (dramatic music) (sword swooshes) (swords clang) (dramatic music) - Congestion brother? (smacks) - Now you've made me angry. (yells savagely) (dramatic music) - I will make quick work of you, tub of lard. (sobs) (dramatic music) (grunting) (smacks) - Lay down your weapon, good knight. Or else it's good night. (chuckles) - Well that about wraps it up then. - All in a days work. - Where's William? - [Both] Don't know. (dramatic music) (swords clash) (dramatic music) (intense music) (sword swooshes) (smacks) (grunting) (crowd clamors in fear) - Sire! (dramatic music) - That's mine. - Father's sword was the one thing you could never take from me, Henry. - You were always his favorite. - He tried to love you, but your jealousy and your hatred always blinded you to that. (sorrowful music) (yells out) (screams then thud) (sorrowful music) (sputtering) - Hail William! - [Crowd] Hail William! (cheering) - Hail William! (cheering) (uplifting music) (dramatic music) - Hail William! (laughter) - Hail William! - Hail William! (dramatic music) (cheering) (regal music) (cheering and applause) - [Crowd] Hail William! - Father? Father, is William going to give us a baby dragon? You said he might. - We'll see, Jamie. Dragons eat a lot, you know. - I'll grow a garden just to feed it. - As reward for helping us win this day, I hereby make my first official decree. One of our dragon's off spring shall go to Jamie and the Blacksmith. (laughter) My friends, please kneel. In the absence of his Royal Majesty the King, and by the power invested in me as Barron of this region, for your part in helping us to victory this day, I knight each of you. Thank you, Josh Kirby. Irwin 1137. - Eight, sire. - 11378. And Azabeth Siege. We will forever be in your debt. (cheering and applause) (uplifting music) - Where's Prism? - [Prism] (muttering) - Oh stop playing games, Prism. We still have the Nullifier to find. - No wait, I get it. - Get what? I mean Prism is hungry, that's all. I'll bet Zoetrope hasn't fed his a single morsel of food then entire time he's kept him prisoner. - No. He's not hungry. He's trying to tell us that the dinosaur ate the Nullifier component. - [Prism] (chirping) - Isn't that it, Prism? - (Squeaks) - My friends, may I speak with you privately for a moment? Let's be frank with one another. I don't know where you come from, and I don't think that I wish to know. I fear it might be harmful somehow. But know that I am grateful for your intervention. However it was arranged by providence. God speed and protect you in your travels. In your food storage compartment? Farewell Josh Kirby. - My lord. - Bye Josh. - Bye lad. - So, how do we get the component back without major surgery? - Well I want you to find me the largest mixing bowl in the entire village. And prune juice. Lots and lots of prune juice. - Ugh, what is that? - Well let's just call it dino laxative. - [Prism] (trilling) - That's right dinosaur, drink it all up. (slurping and chomping) - Sure gave that triceratops a bad case of indigestion, Irwin. - She'll be fine. I don't know where Dr Zoetrope could be, but I strongly suggest we vacate this area as quickly as possible. - Yeah. (laser fires, people screaming) - [Irwin] Get the platform, quickly. (lasers fire) (dramatic music) - You're no match for me, Josh Kirby. Put that weapon down before I'm forced to hurt you. (laser fires) (suspenseful music) - Oh no. (yelling) - [Josh] Holy moly. - [Irwin] What on earth is that. (screaming) - [Prism] (cooing) (suspenseful music) - Hey. - Keep off. Oh give me a break. You were the one who was all over me. - You really don't expect me to believe that, do you? - (Trilling) - What's going on? Picked the wrong time to loose my helmet. That's the second time I've been knocked out today. Hey, get a load of Prism. There must be a Nullifier component near by. Where's my power staff? - That giant alien must have taken it while we were out cold. - My weapons are gone as well. - What was that thing? I thought we were still on earth. - We are still on earth, Josh. But the earth of the far future. I can only deduce that by the time the year 70,379 rolls by, my current's been defeated by these alien giants. That, or these mutant behemoths are our distant evolutionary descendants. Either way we're in rather big trouble. - (Groaning) - Oh no. (moaning) - [Azabeth] They're enormous, Josh Kirby. They're coming this way. (yelling) (suspenseful music) - He's a kid. The one who found us, he's a kid. And those are his parents. - [Irwin] Oh. (moaning) - Oh no. The second most intelligent man of the 25th century, reduced to the status of a human pet. - Oh no. They're leaving him all alone. Remain calm. We have to remain calm. - [Irwin] What's he doing? - [Josh] This is not good. - [Irwin] Put us down you (mumbles) child. - [Josh] Come on. (yelling) Irwin look! - I wish he wouldn't squeeze so hard. - Incredible. The child has a collection of time displaced humans. They must be the flotsam and jetsam left in the wake of Zoetrope manic time trek. Poor souls randomly plucked from their own worlds, and catapulted through the time stream to this god forsaken place. - Put how can people from other times be here? I thought you said time travel was impossible for living things. - Man made time travel. These people have been brought here by nature it's self. A nature which has been interfered with by Dr Zoetrope. (humming and mumbling) - Forcing us to fight for his amusement. Just like back home. - [Giant] (giggling) - Wait a sec, these guys are stuck here just like we are. We have no reason to fight. (gun shots) (yelling) - How about to avoid being splattered against something. - Oh, yeah that's a pretty good reason. (moans) (gun shots in background) - Viva la France! (dramatic music) - (Chirps) - Enguard. (fast paced music) (weapons clash) - She's amazing. (gun shot in background) - (Chirping) - Oh, take it, Prism. (gun shots) - (Speaking giant language) - Leave us alone, you overgrown infant. - He wants us to fight each other. - [Azabeth] (yells in background) - I won't hear of it. - Well we've got to do something, otherwise we'll end up as wall paper. Why don't you blast him with your power staff. (whines) - [Giant] (chuckles) - I'm afraid my power staff is a rather delicate instrument which has been damaged by the jostling of these fleshy headed mutants. - In other words we're up a creek without a paddle. (dramatic music) (gun shots) (weapons clangs and clash) I've got an idea. - What? - Follow my lead. - What in heaven's name are you doing? - What they don't have kung fu movies int he 25th century? - Oh I see, we are gonna fake an intimate knowledge of the marshal arts, ha ha! Oh , sorry. - (Whining) (dramatic music) (gun shots) - Oh you Shea Ling pragmatic style is good, but still I must destroy you. - Oh no. No, my quantum particle acceleration style is more than a match for the likes of you. (dramatic music) (weapons clang) (guns click empty) - You two can stop your ridiculous gyrations, I've won. (dramatic music) - (Giggles and cheers) - I owe you my life. In solemn accordance with the 12th code of Kang, I pledge not to leave your side until this debt is repaid. - You don't have too. Oh, yeah, the 12th code. My dad always told me you got to play by the rules. (giggling) - This is a fine weapon. Much like the shriek of the draconian guard. You must teach me to use it someday. - Sure. It's a date. (yelling) - [Josh] Oh no, put us back down. - [Azabeth] Put us down you (mumbles). (dramatic music) - Stay back Josh Kirby, I'll finish off this pathetic excuse for a warrior. - No. There's no reason for us to fight anymore. Are you okay? Look, I'm sorry about the bump on the head D'Artagnan. Here. - (Speaks French) - Oh, y'all speak English? Woo wee! Gave up hoping I'd meet anyone in this crazy town which savvy my lingo. Names Willie Pooch, out of Dry Gulch, Kansas. What's your handle half pint? - Josh, Josh Kirby. - Well howdy. - These are my friends, Irwin 1138. - Howdy. - Howdy, howdy. - Azabeth Siege. - Oh, mama. - And this down here is Prism. - Oh cute little coyote. Puts me in mind of that time I was pond for turmoil out by Sassafras Creek. Creature just like him sprung upon me from out of the dim night and my heart nearly stopped. Before I realized it was just Midget McCarthy back from panning for gold. He'd been up in the hills so long his whiskers had grown clean down to his toes. - I thought he said he spoke English? - If you gentlemen are quite finished telling these tall tales, I suggest we move on to the more pressing matter of planning our escape. - Woo wee, you speak English too. How come you never said nothing? - Well in your case I prefer to let my pistol do the talking. - Not a very friendly fellow, are you? - Friendship is not the issue. We all share the same predicament. We were all struck by lightening, and somehow transported into the clutches of this over fed, kent, Unt we must escape. - You sure talk mighty funny, bud. Where you from anyhow? - Heidelberg. - Oh, Heidelberg? Is that south of the border? - Nein, dummkoff. (all speaking at once) - Alright now listen up. I don't care what language you speak, but we all have to shut up and work together so we can get out of this mess. - Perhaps I can be of some assistance. (speaking French) (uplifting music) (all talking at once) - What was that all about? Are they just mad because she's a girl and she can fight better than they can. - Beats me. I gave up trying to understand human behavior years ago. That's why I'm a physicists. (staff whirs) (soft music) - What's wrong, Azabeth? - Nothing. Nothing is wrong, this is how it always is. - What do you mean? - Where I come from all of my people are traded as property. We are forced to fight each other in arenas of war just because we are different. - Different, I don't get it. - Don't try and tell me you haven't noticed. - Noticed what? - This. And this. I'm not like you and those others Josh Kirby. I'm only half human. Pure humans think me and my people are freaks. Twisted, weird. - Look, some people think I'm weird too. - Really? - Sure. But that's their problem. I admit I used to worry about this a lot. Especially Mrs Manabalm's social studies class. You see there was this girl, Beth. Every time I tried to make eye contact with her, she'd turn and look at me like I was some sort of disease. She was friendly to everybody. Except yours truly. Man she was beautiful. (school bell rings) And believe me, girls weren't my only problem. A couple of guys on the junior varsity team thought they owned the place. - Don't you know who I am? - Duke. - Duke Dunkington. Quarterback of the football team. - Captain of the wrestling team. Anchor of the track team, and God's gift to Green Oaks High. - If I tell you, do my homework geek, - Maggot. - Worm. - You do my homework. - [Josh] I think high school isn't so much a place for learning, as it is for maybe an organized attempt to make each and every student feel like a worm. (school bell rings) It gets to me some days. It gets to me a lot. (whimsical music) But the truth is, it doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is what I think of myself. If I'm happy with me, I don't have to go out and buy some special sneakers, or listen to the most popular music, or live in some big fancy house just to make people think I'm cool. - For one so young you posses a great wisdom, Josh Kirby. Here. Here take this. To protect yourself in case something happens to me. - Thanks. (clears throat) - Excuse me, Josh. These gentlemen would like to apologies to Azabeth Siege. Monsieur Don Joure thought you were a hellish sorceress conjured up by his arch enemy. Cardinal Arigleou. - Oh yeah, sweet cakes, I thought you were was some kind of Siamese witch woman out to put the hoo ju on me. It was all just a misunderstanding. Give us a second chance, what do you say? - Could we please put an end to this love fest und get back to the matter at hand. Macht schnell! - Yelling won't help matters. But perhaps this will. Excuse me. (dramatic music) - A cane? And what do you suggest we do, old man? Limp our way out? - My power staff may require a little re-calibrating from time to time. Once that's done. - These magic tricks may impress these creatures, but I am a man of the world. - Oh. (staff beeping) (glass shatters) Any more comments, man of the world? - Nien. - You're all welcome to join us, if you wish. (speaking French) (dramatic music) - Well wait for me. (glass clinking) Where to, partners? - Don't worry. He's got it all figured out. He's the second most brilliant man of the 25th century. - Josh, I have a confession to make. I acted rather prematurely in order to shut up that loud mouth German. In fact, I've no idea what our next move is. - We've got to find the time pod. - But how? We could be thousands of mils away from where we landed. Could take us years to find that giant kids foot print. - Now listen to me Irwin 1138, I was a kid once myself. I know how they think. No kid, not even a giant mutant kid, could take a collection of action figures home and leave their super cool scale model vehicle behind. - Look, up there. It's my beloved Brunhilde. - Yes! - Where? Where is this Brunhilde? I don't see no girlie up there. Brunhilde is mine plane, you idiot. - But plane or fancy I still don't see no girlie. - But how are we going to get up to the time pod? It's a sheer cliff, 50 feet high. - I have an idea. Follow me. We'll use this to make a rope. - Monsieur Don Joure. - Oh it's disgusting. It's a kids underwear. Alright, lets help her out D'Artagnan. - You know. Oh, sorry Pierre. I was champion cow roper of Wabash County three years running. I'll knot those suckers up. - Oh you sure about this Azabeth? - I scaled a 1000 foot wall in Gouldren Fortress of Quan when I was seven. I think I know what I'm doing. - I'm sorry. (fabric ripping) - My Brunhilde is the finest fighter plane on the entire western front. (fabric tearing) - You must be very proud. (snoring) (dramatic music) (ripping) (loud snoring) - There you go, darlin'. - Now are you certain that these knots will hold our weight? - Sweet cakes this baby is strong enough to hog tie a herd of wild buffalo, ugh-huh. - (Chirps) (yelling) - Well done, Prism. - Thanks Prism. - Woo wee! (intense music) (rope thuds to floor) - Last one up is a desert cockroach from the barren planets of Rinmar seven. - You got a head start, sweet cakes. (intense music) - Be careful Josh Kirby, and remember number 14 of the 21 codes of Kang. - Yeah, what's that. - [Azabeth] Never look down. - Alright, come on. - This is dirty infantry work. I should be flying above it all. But I will do anything to get back to my beloved Brunhilde. - You certainly have an interesting relationship with your plane. - Woo wee, I ain't see this much rope since Judge Parker strung up all 12 of the Algebers at once. (speaking French) - Oh you said it, Lucky Pierre. Don't know what you said, but you did say it. (pane groaning) - Did you feel that? - What? - The rope. It slipped. (grunting and straining) Quick, Josh Kirby stop the plane. (clamoring) it's slipping. Hold on Josh Kirby. - [Cowboy] Hurry up now. (dramatic music) (yelling) - Well done. (breathing heavy) - My compliments. You all deserve the Iron Cross for saving Brunhilde. (speaking German) - Oh that Heidelberg dude is not playing with a full deck. - Oh cool. - What's that? - This is a mountain bike. It's excellent. I had a bike at home, but nothing like this. All my dad could afford was a rusty old one speed. Oh man, I hope he's not worried about me. You know I can just imagine him coming home the night I took off on this crazy mission. It probably seemed like any other night, really. He would have been bushed from another hard day at the plant. - Josh. - [Josh] My dad is always worried about my future. How was I gonna do on the SATs? Are college costs going up faster than his credit line? Or was I gonna totally flake out and decide not to go to college at all? - Josh, I'm home. (suspenseful music) For crying out loud Josh, do you know what time it is? - He never used to let me do anything dangerous. Anything physical at all, really. He was afraid I would hurt myself and ruin my chances to go to Harvard and Yale. If I pass this AP test, well they're having tryouts after school next week for the football team. Yeah, I'm pretty fast and I know-- - Team sports cut too deep into homework time - But dad. - Besides, you don't want to hang out with those guys. They're all dumb jocks. One out of a 1000 will land a $1 million contract the rest will end up with me down at the plant. Or worse, getting grease stains from french fries down at burger world. You just stick to the books. You'll earn a big scholarship and then we won't have to worry about how were gonna have to pay your tuition to Harvard and Yale. - Dad I cant' go to Harvard and Yale. - First time for everything, son. - Every morning on my way to school I would ride my bike like a maniac. (fast paced music) For a kid riding a bike is like flying. Sometimes I pretend I'm flying an F16. Or driving an Indy car. Or doing a motor cross. Spokes spinning, the wind in your hair, the leaves in your face. There are few things more fun than riding a bike. Sorry. (fast paced music) It was my one real chance for adventure. After all my dad couldn't keep me from going to school. - Will you show me how it works? - Yeah, sure. (speaking German) - Y'alls don't get out much, do ya Heidelberg? (speaking German) (suspenseful music) - What's the trouble? - The storm which brought me here seems to have injured Brunhilde. - You mean the engine isn't working? - I mean the engine is dead. - Hey, is that a parachute? Oh how do you work this thing? - Why do you ask such stupid questions? You count to three, and you pull the cord. (speaking German) - Hey, this is what they use to go sky diving with. - What's sky diving? Is it anything like riding a bike? - Don't you idiots understand what this means? Without mine plane I am stuck up here. - Join the club, Heidi. - Hey maybe you'll just have to leave your plane here and come with the rest of us. - Josh, it's not as simple as that. My time pod wasn't designed to transport this many people through the fourth dimension. And even if it was, where would we transport them too? Their native temporal zones must be just as screwed up as yours. - We can't just leave 'em here. (giant groans) (dramatic music) - He seems upset. - I set my buetocks he's angrier than a pole cat in a hornets nest. And we are as doomed as a tender foot in Tomb Stone. - We can not give up now. The battle is not lost if the warrior still has the courage to fight on, that's clearly stated in the third code of Kang. - Viva la Kang. - Yeah, you said it Azabeth. And it sure ain't over yet. - Josh what are you doing? - I'm gonna get his attention. Divert him away from you guys. - What are we supposed to do then? - You'll think of something. (giant muttering) (dramatic music) - What are you doing old man? - Josh put himself into danger in order to buy us some more time. We must make full use of it. Now if I can locate the appropriate circuitry, I can perform what you 20th century primitives call a jump start. - Come on. - Be careful Josh Kirby! - Yee ha! - Come on, you big bully. Catch me if you can. (mumbling and groaning) (dramatic music) - Over here shorty. (crying) - (Speaking giant) (crying) - Oh thank god. - [Zoetrope] Joshua. Over here, help me Joshua. (dramatic music) - Dr Zoetrope? - [Zoetrope] Josh you must free me so that I can save the universe. - What do you think I am? An idiot? You want to destroy the universe. Everything that ever did exist, does exist or will exist. I saw what you did to my time just by showing up. And you've already found a second Nullifier component. - Listen to me boy. There are forces at work here which you cannot understand. Help me out of my unfortunate predicament, and I will give you power you have never dreamed of. - What good is power if you don't have your friends? Or your family, or your home? No, I'll never help you. - Then you've sealed your own doom, Josh Kirby. (squishing) - Oh yuck. I'll help you out of this mess, but only so Irwin 1138 can take you back to the 25th century nut house, where you belong. - Only a little fool could be taken in by that jealous old man. - Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me. - How about giant mutant spiders of 70,000 AD? - Don't try that trick on me. Maybe I'll quite this nice guy routine, and leave you stuck in this web until your friend spider really does come back. (dramatic music) (growling) (laser blast) - We must hurry. The kid could return at any moment. - Hey Irwin, you think he'll be okay up here? - Yes his time armor will protect him from the rigors of chronoal displacement. Besides he's too big to go into the time pod. And I can't figure out how to get him out of that blasted thing. - [Zoetrope] I'm still smarter than you Irwin. Nothing you can do can change that. - Oh. (beeping) - Well have you made up your minds? - Yeah. We took a vote and it was unanimous. Even my Nordic ancestor Guntag Muntag over here agreed. After he regained his senses. - Yeah. - That was my idea. Democracy in action. - Stupidity in action would be closer to the truth. None the less your jump start seems to have given Brunhilde an endless power supply. So it shouldn't be that dangerous for us. After all we could live for a year off the table scraps from one of these creatures between meal snacks. We will explore far and wide. Seeking for others, others such as ourselves. Perhaps I will even find Heidelberg again. There is, however, one problem. Brunhilde simply cannot carry more than four persons. And that's stripped bare and with this cow poker strapped to the wing. - Now that sounds right fun, Heidi. What part is the wing? - Josh if your own theory is correct. Once we've traced Dr Zoetrope steps back through time to the 25th century, Azabeth Siege will be blinked back to her own time where ever that is, and you'll never see her again. - Well at least we'll get a chance to hang out with each other. - Well put. - Yeah, thanks. - Listen Azabeth, if you want to come with Irwin and me, it's no trouble, really. I mean I think it would be great if you came. But it's all up to you. - Of course I'm coming with you. Josh Kirby how many times must I tell you, in solemn accordance with the 12th code of Kang, I must remain by your side until I have saved your life. In return for you saving mine. - What if you never get the chance to save my life? - Then we must spend the rest of our days together. - Well. Yeah, I can live with that. All aboard, all aboard. - Schnell. - Azabeth is coming with us. - Au Revoir, mes amis. - Au Revoir. - Nice knowing you, buckaroos. Hope we cross paths again sometime. - Yeah. - Well come along you two. Time is one thing we can't afford to waste. (dramatic music) - You think they'll make it? - Well as long as they don't strangle each other they should be okay. (plane propeller humming) - Woo! (plane whooshes by) (crying) (beeps and bops) - Prepare for the storm. (time pod humming) (dramatic music) (yells and cries) (engines blast) - Here you are young lady. Now it's perfectly safe for you to go out in time periods other than your own. Like our next stop, 1994. That's where I'm from, you know. - That'll be interesting to see. - Well, it's not exactly how it's supposed to be. But we're gonna fix all that. Right, Irwin 1138? - Right. Prism, don't touch that button. (dramatic music) Grab him, Josh. - Prism stop! (whoosh) (beeps) - I don't believe it. Prism's gone wrong. - It just goes to prove number 18 of the 21 codes of Kang. Anything too cute can't be trusted. (dramatic music) - Help, help. (alarm blaring) - Josh Kirby. Hold on, Josh Kirby. - Azabeth! Come on, reach. (alarm blares) - Josh. - Josh Kirby. - You can do it. (yelling) Reach. - Hold on. - [Josh] Come on, come on. - [Irwin] Well done, Azabeth. - Josh Kirby, are you alright? Are you hurt? (chirps) - I don't know. I could have grabbed for him, but my side kind of hurts. - Where? - No, no lower. No lower. Lower. Right there. Yeah. Owe. - That's what you get for faking an injury. - Okay, okay geeze. - Look, will you two stop fooling around. Zoetrope is gone. And so are the Nullifier components. - I saved your life just now Josh Kirby. My debt to you have been repaid. - Yeah. You know I don't get it. I thought Prism was on our side. - Yeah was on our side. But somehow Zoetrope must have turned him. This is terrible. What's worse there's no way of telling which time period they've fled too. - Excuse me. - What? - I think I know where we need to go. (computer beeps) Yeah, yeah I did this right. Didn't I? - Brace yourselves. Prepare for the storm. (explosion) (yells) - [Announcer] On the next chapter of Josh Kirby, Time Warrior. (yelling) - Look my name's Josh, and I'm afraid I'm lost. - Don't be afraid, Josh. (growls) - [Josh] This place is really weird. - [Doll] No it's not, you silly. It's toy world. (cheering) - I have tried every trick in the time travel book to locate Josh. - I've got to get back to the time pod. - There is an off chance that Zoetrope's slightly superior intellect may enhance his ability to pinpoint Josh's location. - [Zoetrope] I'm here for one reason, and one reason only. - What is it? - It's a piece of the Nullifier. - [Zoetrope] The component, Josh. Now. - Alright. New game everyone. Keep this glass bulb away from the big scary guy, what do you say? (laughing and clamoring) (laughter) - This is getting really good. - [Zoetrope] Come back here, Joshua. - Josh and I are going into Nightmare Forest. - Nightmare Forest? - Nightmare Forest? Isn't there some way we could talk this out? - [Zoetrope] It's true, he is a time warrior. - Whoa. I'm some kind of warrior. Call me Time Lord. - Wait a minute. - [Josh] Unless you toys are with me. The universe is doomed for destruction at the hands of this mad man. (dramatic music) There's some way out of here. - Well I say we take care of that big bully once and for all. (boing) (smack) (yelling) (squelch) (squish) (laughter) (dramatic music) (whimsical music) (MultiCom Jingle)
