Executive Producers: TSUI FAT, DANIEL CHAN Producer: TSUI FAT Associate Producer: KEN LO Screenplay: HUNG HIN-PANG Production Manager: LAM TAT-YEE Thailand Production Manager: SUPHAK OU Action Choreography: LUNG SANG, CHOI HIN-CHEUNG, TONY TAM Art Director: RUBY KO Director of Photography: PHILIP MA Music Coordinators: SIMON LEUNG, TONY TAM Action Director: TSUI FAT We arrested Tung-Yeung on the 7th during a raid on the Big Circle gang. We caught him in the middle of brokering an arms deal with them. Upon investigating, we found that Tung-Yeung's not just any old run-of-the-mill arms dealer. This is why we forwarded his information over to Interpol. Only then did we learn your government has a warrant for his arrest. I want to thank the Hong Kong Police for their courtesy and cooperation. As the crimes Tung-Yeung is accused of involve state secrets, we need to take him back to the US for questioning. The two investigators accompanying you back to America are in charge of organised and serious crime teams. They also took part in the Big Circle Gang raid. - Hi. Superintendent Chan. - Sir. The two of you come here for a moment. Let me introduce you. This is Mr Wong from the US Consulate. This is Peggy. John. Ann. All three are agents of the CIA. - Inspector Kwan Ching-Kin. - Call me Cutie. - This is Inspector Ng Lai-Yung. - Call me Sonny. - Come! Let's have a chat. - Sure. Sir? We've prepped the intel on Tung-Yeung's crimes in Hong Kong. Cutie, could we have a look? - Hand it over. - Alright. Inspector Kwan? This is it? Is there anything else? That's all we could find. Oh, that's right... So where's Tung-Yeung now? He's being escorted over from a different station. He should be here soon. Co-starring: SHING FUI-ON, KEN LO Director: THOMAS YIP Mark, go with them in the van. Let's get going, then. Hey, Cutie? Don't drive so fast. We all gotta follow ya! Got it... Over. Hey, Sonny? Superintendent Chan says we're gonna be in LA for three weeks. You... take this chance and score with a white boy! Keep me out of it! You go score with the white chicks. You're such a dirty slut, you better watch out for AIDS. Don't end up infecting me as well... Peggy? Seems the intel on Tung-Yeung's not much use. They don't have what we're looking for. It's not their fault. Our government never contacted Hong Kong. They don't even know what we want. - What's going on?! - Are they for real?! They're not messing around! - Looks like they're here for Tung-Yeung! - Cover me, then! Go! You alright? Mark?! Hurry up! Go! Go check it out! - Stay and keep an eye on him! - Okay! Mark? Are you alright?! Mark? Mark?! Sonny?! Let 'em go! Let's get back to the van. - You okay? Where's Tung-Yeung?! - He got away. - Did those people rescue him? - I'm not too sure. Peggy?! Mark and the others in the van are all dead! I don't care whose fault it was or wasn't. You're both writing me a report! The higher-ups now want us to cooperate fully with the CIA, and retrieve both Tung-Yeung and the chip! Sir, what chip? It's a memory chip for our country's advanced missile systems, a national security asset. Now that it's in Tung-Yeung's hands, it could be bought by ambitious countries. We came here because our mission is to retrieve the chip. Interpol sent word that someone from the Third World has bought the chip and that Tung-Yeung may have sold it through a middleman. Therefore, Tung-Yeung's kidnapping and the sale of the chip must be related! So who were those people that kidnapped Tung-Yeung? It was like they knew he was being taken to the airport. Their whole operation was planned! That's why we have to find these killers. That's how we'll find Tung-Yeung! Right... You better get it through your head that this is Hong Kong. Any action must comply with Hong Kong law. It absolutely won't tolerate your recklessness! Superintendent Chan, rest assured. I promise we'll cooperate. We won't undermine Hong Kong's rule of law. We have an understanding, then. Oh, and Peggy... The Consulate has arranged accommodation. Someone will drive you there soon. Mr Fok? You have a call. Mr Fold! Sorry for botherin' ya. - I wanna ask if there's any news. - Do it later... Why are you so impatient? You're staying at my hotel. I guarantee no one will find you. My men are also outside keeping an eye out. Just relax and enjoy your stay. You don't get it, Mr Fok. The cops and the CIA are everywhere lookin' for me. The faction's guys are here too! It's real dicey for me right now. You worry too much. Once the date for the exchange has been decided, I'll let you know. I'll give you the rest of the money and the passport then. Oh, yeah... It's better if you stay out of sight for a while. If there's anything you need, I'll have someone bring it to you. So? You happy with the girl? I'm happy! I'm happy! She's got Veronica Yip's face, and a body to kill for. There isn't a man who can resist...! Mr Fok's hospitality sure can't be beat! Am I right? As long as you're satisfied. Alright, I'll be in touch. Gimme that. Oi, this is yours! Oi?! So how was it? Anyone tail you on the way back? Of course not! Hey, where's the prizefighter? Hang in there now. Hang in there! Boxer?! Water! How's Long Hair? Are they finished? They're not done yet! You can't rush these things! Yeah! It takes time! I'm gonna get going, then. Thanks. How are things on the outside? Any word on Tung-Yeung? Nothing as yet. But we've gotten word from the general. Tung-Yeung's got a guardian angel in Hong Kong. This guy wants to sell the chip for him as well. Do you know who's looking out for him? That I don't know. That double-crossing rat... He sold out the faction. If I get my hands on him... there'll be hell 10 pay! The Hong Kong cops and the CIA are looking everywhere for him. Guess we have to get to him first. Who do you reckon will find him first, the CIA or me? That Fok Chi-Kin sure loves... We've received intel from both Interpol and the CIA naming Fok Chi-Kin as the middleman in Hong Kong. We all know the one. Fok Chi-Kin is a business magnate. He commands influence in Hong Kong. So, until we have sufficient evidence, we mustn't jump the gun! Sir? What is it? We just received a tip-off the kidnappers are hiding in Yuen Long. Could it be?! Everyone, listen up. The cops are here. Prepare to pull out. Open the door. Go! Freeze! Move, and I'll shoot! Didn't see you there. Peggy? Who is this? Don't point that thing at me! Cutie, this is Ronald. He was sent here by Langley. You're not a bad shot. A bit better than you. Water! Hang in there...! Are you a man or not?! This is nothin'... Looks like the police in Hong Kong are something else. If we weren't so prepared, we'd be toast. I've never underestimated the CIA. But I never would've guessed... the cops here in Hong Kong would be so effective. We almost died at their hands. The most important thing now is to contact the general for instructions. - Alright. We'll do just that. - Okay. Bro! He's hurt real bad. He might not make it! Go do something else. Give me your gun. Long Hair, don't do anything stupid. Don't you do anything stupid! Boxer... Do you even know what you're doing?! I know exactly what I'm doing. Don't make me shoot you. This is Hong Kong, so I'm your boss! You may be my boss, but I have the right to disagree. Just kill me. I don't wanna drag our brothers down! Kill me! Whatever happens... you're not going in the clink. Don't worry. I'll find a doctor to fix you up. Boxer... hurry and find a place our brothers can rest. Those guys only got away through dumb luck. We're sure of one thing, though: they're also looking for Tung-Yeung. Exactly! So you have to be one step ahead and find Tung-Yeung first. In order to find him, we need to focus our efforts on Fok Chi-Kin. Peggy? Now that you have Ronald here, I think we can split into two teams. Sir, I'll leave this up to you. Very well. Whitey, meeting's tomorrow at 3 pm. Let Peggy know if you see her. Hmm? They're back already. This is a nice place...! And it's close to the city. Oh really? - C'mon. - I can do it myself. Ronald, want some soft drink? Thanks. Oh yeah, Ann? How's it been working with the police here in Hong Kong? It's been fine... But don't you feel they work too slowly? They've got zero initiative. Can't do a thing without their superior's say-so. Peggy hasn't said anything? What can she say? Even she takes orders from them now. I think you better have a chat with her. Oh really? I never would've guessed that after two years... this is where we'd see each other again. Ronald, I think you and I are perfectly clear about our mission. I hope we can cooperate and get the job done. What makes you think I'll be uncooperative? That's not what I'm talking about! This mission relies on teamwork, not on you flying solo. This is Hong Kong, not the States. You better get this through your head. - Open the door, please. - What is it? Ma'am, this is a court-issued search warrant. We're cops. We suspect the owner is involved in an arms trafficking case. - We wanna take a look around. - How long will you be? - It'll be quick! Thank you. - Does Mr Fok know about this? You search upstairs. I'll stay down here. Okay. - Hi, miss. - Hi. Is Mr Folk Chi-Kin in? Mr Fok's in a meeting. See his secretary. Miss? Is Mr Fok Chi-Kin in? May I ask who you are, please? Do you have an appointment? We're cops. We need to see Mr Fok. Can we pop in real quick? Mr Fok's still in a meeting. Why don't you take a seat over there? I'll ask him when his meeting's over. Alright. Thanks. Hey?! Which department you with? You think a warrant's all that?! Don't you know this is Mr Fok's home? Don't bother me when I'm working. I only just had dinner with Superintendent Tsui. He's a real good mate of mine. Hey, you deaf?! Can you hear me?! What's your warrant number...?! Show me the proposal before tomorrow's meeting starts. Okay. Mr Fok, there are some officers over there who want to see you. Mr Fok, I'm Inspector Kwan Ching-Kin. These two are agents of the CIA. - I want to ask... - If you have questions, ask my lawyer. If you want to chat, make an appointment with my secretary. Mr Fok, we suspect you're involved in the Tung-Yeung arms trafficking case. - Please cooperate with us. - I'm warning you! Don't go slandering me. I don't know any Tung-Yeung or Yung-Teung! Mr Fok? Mr Fok, your lawyer Mr Yeung says it's urgent. Hello? Hello, Mr Fok? Two cops tore your place up like dogs! One of 'em even hit me! Hey, take it easy now! I'm a lawyer. I can sue you! Hello, Mr Fok? Your lawyer's breath stinks! Janet, tell security to get rid of them. Call the Commissioner of Police and the US Consul General. Ask them what they're trying to pull. I went too far?! If his breath didn't stink so bad, I wouldn't have hit him! Like I gotta be nice to a bootlicker like that! Your manners are another thing entirely! You know we don't have the evidence. How can I justify your actions to the Hong Kong Police?! Don't forget who you are. And don't forget why you're in Hong Kong! I haven't forgotten. I'm also not taking sides. I'm looking at the bigger picture! Don't forget you got put on desk duty for using excessive force on a perp. Now you've got a chance to come back to the field, you should be grateful! Is this you teaching me a lesson? I'm not teaching you. I'm just reminding you so you don't mess up again! You listen here: I haven't done anything wrong! Just let it go, Peggy. Maybe Ronald didn't even mean for it to happen. Or maybe I know you too well. You're the same person today you were two years ago! Hey, Peggy?! Well...? You have an update for me? Yeah. We've confirmed Fok Chi-Kin's role. He really is helping a Third World country buy the chip. - So it really is him. - There's more. Those killers and Tung-Yeung were originally part of the same group. Tung-Yeung sold them out, so they've come over here to find him and the chip. Fok must know his whereabouts, then. Right. We need to close in on Fok. Oh, yeah... I'm sorry about what happened at Fok's place. Don't be silly. It had nothing to do with you. Here's your chance, okay? I'll go inside and tell them the news...! Let's take a walk over there. My hunch was right... I said it was him from the start! So can we take action, or do we have to wait for your superiors again? Let's tail Fok Chi-Kin first. - Hey, Whitey, where are you going?! - Could he be going after Fok? Whitey! Don't be brash. I'm telling ya, I ain't waiting around like you two! Whitey?! Ann, go after Whitey, or we're in deep shit! - What about Peggy? - There's no time, c'mon! Put it on hold for now. We'll discuss this another time. Fok Chi-Kin! Where's Tung-Yeung? What do you want, pal?! Let me tell you something. I just make one phone call... and you'll be out of a job. Your breath stinks as much as your lawyer's! So you're the one who made a mess of my home. Start the car! - Out! - What are you doing?! - Where's Tung-Yeung?! - I don't know! You don't know?! - I know nothing! - Where is he?! - Where's Tung-Yeung?! - I don't know... Don't know, huh? Where's Tung-Yeung?! You gonna tell me or not?! - You gonna tell me?! - I don't know... - I'll beat you till you know! - Whitey, stop it! Get a hold of yourself! - Right on time! Charge him with lynching! - Shut up! - Charge me, then. C'mon! - Whitey, stop! This will end badly! - Stop it! - Step aside! 'Lynching', huh? I'll show you! Where's Tung-Yeung?! There, lynching. How fun is that? So much fun, right?! - Whitey! Calm down! - Stop it! Sir?! Over here! My boss is here! Charge me, then! You gonna charge me?! Do you think you're Inspector Tequila, or do you think you're Rambo?! We might know Fok is the middleman, but we don't have the evidence! He's now suing you for false imprisonment and attempted lynching! How many times have I said it? This is Hong Kong! You follow our laws! Otherwise, go back to America! Superintendent Chan, I'm going for a piss. What's the law say about that? Sir, my apologies for putting you in this position. What's done is done. There's nothing else I can say. Fok has petitioned the court for a writ of ha be as corpus. From now on, we can't go near him. Everyone, listen up! We have confirmation that Tung-Yeung is indeed colluding with Fok Chi-Kin in the sale of the missile chip. That makes it easy, then. What were Tsai-Fu's instructions? All he said was that we must retrieve the chip by whatever means necessary. Just who is this Folk Chi-Kin? He's ostensibly a businessman. This time, he's brokering the purchase of the chip to the Third World. From what you're saying, Tung-Yeung's got someone backing him. So what? Like I care who's backing him! If they're in our way, they're going down! Brother? Then we do make our move?! - Yeah, when are we doing this? - There's no rush. When the time is ripe, the faction will let us know. - Go make some preparations! - Let's go! Some game! Don't worry. We'll take the pot for sure! Mr Fok? The cops are still waiting outside. If they like waiting, then let them wait. Besides, waiting around's what they're best at. Understood, Mr Folk. Calling Sonny. Keep your peepers open. You're not just here to hit on boys. Over. You're the only one I'd hit on! Hey?! Don't go calling the kettle black now. Thanks for the heads-up. Hey? You've been partners a long time? Yeah, we've been working together for years. So... why are you called 'Cutie'? My name's Kwan Ching-Kin. Ching and kin put together spells 'cute'! I'm not actually that cute! Hey, you hit on Cutie yet? Don't you dare. We're only talking shop. I should try hitting on Ann, then! Hello? Calling Ann. Ann? Ann? How are things on your end? It's dead outside the house. Not much movement inside either. Got it, over. Hey, Whitey? Have you three been working together long? I've worked with Peggy in the past. Did you know you'd be working with them when you came here? Nope. When I was transferred two years ago, I was separated from Peggy. Separated at work, and separated at home. Sweetie? What do you think of how we operate? It's pretty good. When the higher-ups give us a mission, they don't care how we do it. All that matters is we get the job done. I get that. Attention everyone. There's a taxi pulling up. A girl in red has gotten off. Over. The girl's an assistant at the TV station. She's now gone inside the house. Over. - Ah, Michelle! Finished work early? - Yes. - Mr Fok is watching TV upstairs. - Thank you. Copy. Everyone, continue surveillance. I'll get it! There's an incoming call to the house. Hello? For Mr Fok? Please wait a moment. Hey?! Trace the call already! Don't you worry. Our arrangement remains the same. I'm being followed by some dogs. No, you go alone. Did you find the source of the call? The call was too short. We couldn't trace it. Over. There's no more movement at the main entrance. Over. Why haven't you called me...? You don't have work today? Can't I knock off early today...? What are you watching? A LaserDisc. Let me finish watching Madonna first. You'd rather watch Madonna than watch me...? Hey?! What are you doing?! Hey?! Where's Tung-Yeung? Where are they making the exchange? Tell me! What... What are you talking about? What's happening in there? You... You know this already. I'm just a middleman! Since we all benefit... Ann? How are things on your end? Ronald? There's no reply from Ann. Quickly go check it out! Peggy?! Ann's been injured. Everyone in the van is dead. Sonny and I are heading inside. An ambulance is on its way. Peggy?! The killers got away. Be careful! Got it! We'll pursue at once. We'll stay in touch by phone. Over. Peggy? Do you know where they're headed? No, I don't. They could be going after Tung-Yeung. What a shitshow! Hello?! We're on their tail. Good chance they'll lead us to Tung-Yeung. Let's hope so. We still don't know where they're making the exchange. When you find out, contact me immediately. Okay. Ronald?! We're heading into a tunnel. I'll be in touch when we come out. Okay. Peggy? Hey, Sonny? Contact our guys. Call an ambulance too. With me handlin' this, you can relax! Mr Fok already examined the chip ages ago. It's gonna be totally fine! So what if he did?! He's not the one buying it. Our country is, so we'll examine it! Don't be such a busybody! True that... - How'd it go? - It's fine. Definitely the one we want. Take it! Right... What about the passport?! Like we'd forget! Here! Ronald? Where are you now? You're still in Sha Tin?! We're at Kwai Chung Container Terminal, terminal 5. Contact Superintendent Chan on the double; have him send backup. Looks like this is the place. The time has finally come. Cutie, let's go keep an eye on them until backup gets here. Cover me, okay? This where the boat will be tomorrow? Oi, what's with you? I'm askin' if this is where the boat'll be tomorrow! Think I wouldn't find ya? Where's the chip? I already gave 'em the chip. If you want it, ask them! Stop screwing around! The chip is ours. Hand it over! Says who?! Don't kill me! It's not my fault! They forced me to do it. Don't kill me... It wasn't my fault...! I'm beggin' ya, don't kill me! Don't kill m... Don't kill me. Don't kill me! Don't kill me... Long Hair?! We've retrieved the chip! We're leaving. I can't let them take the chip! We're out of time! Don't do it! You're throwing your life away! Run her down! This way! Go! After 'em! You okay?! Peggy?! Is anybody there...?! Have the area sealed off at once! Everyone else, with me! Peggy...? Answer me! Peggy...? Are you alright?! Peggy?! Are you okay?! Answer me! Didn't you say you'd wait for me before taking action? Peggy?! Peggy...? Peggy, you'll be okay. You'll be fine! The wounded's over there. Cutie?! Are you alright?! I'm fine... Whitey?! You... Didn't you say you'd wait for me?! Why didn't you wait?! Ronald?! Could you calm down before we know all the facts?! So, Cutie... Just what happened here? Don't be so hung up about it. It wasn't your fault. The doctor called this morning and said the surgery was a success, but due to severe concussion, she'll be in a coma for the time being. She'll be under long-term observation. Sir. We shouldn't be so upset. None of us wanted to see Peggy like this. The Consulate has arranged for her 10 be taken home. Sonny. Cutie. You two will go to Thailand and continue to assist the CIA. You'll have the Thai military's support, but it will still be dangerous. Sir, it's both my professional and personal duty to go. I thought as much. Cutie? I'm really sorry about that night. Don't be silly. If I'd gotten there sooner... Peggy wouldn't be in this mess. Well, I'm also responsible. You didn't do anything wrong. I need to shoulder part of the blame. I shouldn't have let her go out there! Inspector Kwan, please take a seat over there. Sure. Hey? Oh yeah, Whitey? Why did you two break up? No... We didn't break up. We had a divorce two years ago. She said I had a rotten temper. That I was unpredictable and brash. Like being with a machine and not a man. C'mon, Whitey. Cheers. I never would've guessed we'd meet again in Hong Kong after two years. You went for drinks without me...?! Now we got two blokes drinking alone like losers...! Luckily, I know what's what. Right? Madam? It's last call! In that case, XO on the rocks, thanks...! Thank you very much! Hey... We're off to Thailand the day after tomorrow. Any thoughts, you two? We're officially going to find the chip. But we're actually going to draw out the killers! So you haven't forgotten? Haven't lost your head after drinking all night, huh?! - I'll get you tonight for sure! - Wanna out-drink me?! Bring it! - Whitey, you too! C'mon! - C'mon...! C'mon...! Count me out! It's not my thing... Not my thing. - Hey? You're not yourself tonight. - Better you don't out-drink me. - Bottoms up...! - Hey, what's with you?! Drop the act! They're back! They're back! C'mon, c'mon! Hurry! - They're back. - Tell General. Right! - Oh, they're back! - They're back... General! I have the chip right here. As everyone knows, over the years, a mountain enclave has become a nesting ground for vermin. Our government has always wanted to uproot those in the mountain enclave. And so, having been approached by both the CIA and Interpol, we offer up our complete support. As for Tsai-Fu's mountain stronghold, it is strategically located on dangerous terrain. Therefore, we must first destroy their fortifications, allowing the army to then launch a pincer attack. General? Can the four of us accompany the vanguard up the mountain? Have the four of you thought this through? This is an extremely dangerous mission. General, you don't have to worry about that. It's true, these guys aren't a walk in the park, but we've faced off against them in Hong Kong. We know how they operate. We'll be an asset to the mountain assault. Very well. The four of you can lead our special unit. I hope we can completely eradicate the mountain enclave. Hey...?! We going out for dinner yet...?! What's wrong with eating in? The barracks are so far from the city, it'll be such a hassle! - It's better to stay in. - That's true... Looks like a decent feed. I bet Cutie made it! As if! The general had someone send it over. - Pretty good... - Hey?! Hands off! - Where are your manners? - Soup's here...! Soup's here, soup's here... - Whoa! What kind of soup? - Canned! Turning canned into shark fin soup's not too shabby. Where's Ann? On her way, I guess... By the way, why did the general send a mix of Chinese and Western food? Whitey told him to. He says it's what he likes. Here. We're Chinese! Of course, Chinese like eating Chinese food! Get your girl some soup, will ya...?! Oi, put a sock in it! I'm not his girl until he has a taste. Hey, better have a taste soon, or I'll take a bite tonight. I'll come and have a taste tonight! Hey? Level with me. You said you'll taste her eventually, so have you? And why do I have to tell you?! - Just to be safe... - Taste your soup instead...! We got a fax from Superintendent Chan this morning. - Any news on Peggy?! - Is she okay?! He didn't say... Maybe there'll be some news soon. Geez... Why'd you stop? Keep eating...! Watch out, Sonny! Wait! Ann might still be in her room! It's only us! Are you alright? We're alright. - Did you find the gunmen? - We're still looking. - Are you guys alright?! - Where did you go? I saw a bunch of gunmen suddenly go into the garden, - so I rushed out to follow them. - Whitey, let's go look for them! Okay! You two stay here. - Thanks. - Are you really okay? I'm fine. I was packing in my room when I heard gunshots, so I rushed downstairs. You didn't even bring your gun just now. That's awfully risky. No, I didn't. I thought you guys might be in trouble, so I went over to help. This yours? Yeah. Impossible! There's no way she's a spy! This may be our first mission together, but every agent undergoes a severe vetting process. If something didn't check out, they would've let me know. Whitey, just listen to me first. There have been too many coincidences. Sonny and I have noticed a lot that's off. That's why we're telling you. So why do you suspect her? Why do you suspect her?! Tell me! The killers knew about Tung-Yeung's escort right from the start. Then they showed up at Fok's house, killing all our guys. Ann only got a gunshot wound though. Last night, we were attacked by gunmen. She rushed out without even arming herself. Later on, I found a knife in her luggage. I'd seen this knife before at Folk's house. I absolutely know what I saw. I get the position you're in, but it's obvious Tsai-Fu sent those gunmen to stop us from going up the mountain. It seems for every single move we've made, the enemy knew in advance. How can you explain everything that's happened since?! We need answers before heading up the mountain. Otherwise, we'll never get that chip back! Men, our assault on the mountain today will be extremely difficult. Due to the extremely precipitous terrain, the special unit will travel up the mountain by water and launch a sneak attack on the armoury. The main force will then launch an all-out assault, completely eradicating the mountain enclave! Failure is not an option for today's operation. May you all exercise extreme caution in carrying out the mission. The details are clear to everyone. I wish you all the best with your mission. Deploy! Hello? This is Sonny. We'll scale the mountain around eight o'clock. When we reach the top, I'll contact you again. Son of a bitch! Ko? The enemy already knows our location. Looks like we need to change route. We won't travel by water, then. We'll go by land instead. Chiu?! Inform the general we're now travelling by land! Calling HQ! Calling HQ! Do you copy?! Do you copy?! No longer travelling by water. Now heading up by land. Over! What are you doing here all by yourself? Wanna tell 'em about our new route? I don't think so. You think no one knows what you're up to? So what if you know? Freeze! People who betray their country... must die. - Mr Kwan! - Ko, how's it on your end? - All under control! - The general wants you! Thanks. General? All good here. We'll reach the foothills tomorrow. The army can deploy at any time. Alright, then. We'll be in touch. Thanks. Time for some grub! Just shut up and eat! - Hurry up! - C'mon, c'mon! - Let's go, let's go! - Hurry up! General, we're at the base of the mountain enclave. Yes. We'll attack them from three directions. We'll attack the armoury first. The main force can deploy at any time. It's settled, then. We'll be in touch. Yes. Thanks. Follow me! Be careful! DANGER Why aren't you dead yet? Let's go, mano a mano. Charge! Attack! The chip's in his mouth! Whitey, watch out! Whitey?! Stay back! Whitey?! Whitey?! Whitey?! Whitey? Last time, it was Peggy in your arms. This time, it's me... You'll be alright! Tell her that... I'm sorry. I won't have a chance to tell her myself. We'll visit her together! You have to visit her...! - Whitey! - Tell her... I still... love her so much... Whitey?! Whitey?! Whitey...? The general's asking if you've found the chip yet.
