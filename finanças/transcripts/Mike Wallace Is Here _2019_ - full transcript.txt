[bucket clatters] [water runs] [scrubbing] There you are. Hey. You gonna tell me what we're doing out here? Come on. All right. [snakes hiss] - Oh. - Wow. There's even more than last time. Are you sure we're supposed to be sneaking up on a nest like this? It's a maternity den. The rocks keep them warm. Helping their babies grow. [snakes rattle] They're so beautiful. You're beautiful. [woman pants] [dog barks] Mara, I hate doing this, you know. Hush up and smile, Dilly. [dog barks] Hey, we're looking for a ride to town. Come here, Bo, come here, Bo. [dog barks] - Come here. -[barks] [door jingles] Hey, how are you? I'm fine. Hi, Sister Slaughter. Pastor know you're here? We'll be quick. It oughta be around here somewhere. [phone rings] [woman] Hello. No, we're closed. Oh, got it. - You all right? - Yeah. [faint country music] Just getting ready for tomorrow. Is that all you're looking for? We should get some of these too. These too. You girls gonna be late for worship. You walk here? Yeah, but it ain't so far. I'll give you a lift. I'm closing up. We got a dog outside. I'll meet you in the lot. Can't believe the party's tomorrow. Are you excited? Yeah. Course I am. He's late. We don't mind the wait. Hey, y'all get in trouble with my ma? Hey, Augie. Come on, girl. [dog barks] Here, let me hold your purse. Hey. I missed you. Hey. So you been good? Yeah, you? All right, I guess. All right, scooch in. [grunts] - Ready? - Mm-hmm. Here, careful. [dog barks] Do you some good to join us today. [sighs] Thanks, Ma, but I'm already pretty full up today. That right? Any more I'd just be plain greedy. [woman scoffs] [wind howls] [engine turns over] Mara! Come on, we're gonna be late. [man shouts indistinctly within] - Amen. - Jesus said, go ye into the world and preach. - Welcome, sisters. - The gospel. - Amen, amen, amen. - Amen? [All] Amen. - Amen? - Amen. He said, those that believeth in me and are baptized -shall be saved, amen? - Amen. But those that believeth not shall be damned. - Shall be damned! - Amen, amen! Hallelujah. These signs shall follow them that flee in my name, In my name, shall they cast out devils. - Amen! - They shall speak -with new tongues, amen? - Amen. - They shall take up serpents. - Amen! - They shall take up serpents. - Amen. And if they drink any deadly thing, -it shall not hurt them, amen? - Amen! [snakes hiss] - And so what happened? - Rattler got him on the neck. Family prayed all night, but he couldn't fight off the venom. And once he passed, the law was up there in no time. Hmm, I see. And since the deceased was still a minor, it ain't gonna stop with him neither. [snake hisses] -[snake strikes] -[quail squeaks] [snake hisses] They out for blood. [Lemuel sighs] Sorry, Daddy, there was a bit more cleaning tonight. It's all right. Garret and I just having a moment. You hungry? Yes, sir. - Well, let's go eat then. - All right. Did Charles say what time he wanted us to be down at the church tonight? I think he said he had to pick something up at about 7:00, so he could make it there at about 7:30. 7:30. All right. Big weekend ahead of you? For all of us. Yes, sir. Well, I'll go rest these old bones. He's a good man. You try not to keep him on hold too long. No, Daddy. You kids get some rest now. Yes, sir, just got to clean up. [water starts] Mara? I just wanted to say... [clears throat] [dishes clink] Well, I never thought I'd have this, you know, a girl like you, taking me on. But here you are. You're a beauty, Mara. Not just talking about that pretty face of yours. Sometimes I worry you might think too much of me, Garret. It's just the God's honest truth. Thank you, Garret. Well. I better head out. Night, then. [water starts] [door creaks] [liquid trickles] [girl sniffles] Oh, loving and kind God, have mercy, have pity on me and take away the awful stain of my transgressions. Oh wash me, cleanse me from this guilt. Let me be pure again. For I admit my shameful deed, it haunts me day and night. Create in me a new clean heart filled with clean thoughts and right desires. Don't toss me aside. [Both] Banished forever from your presence. Or take your Holy Spirit from me. But restore to me the joy of your salvation and make me willing to obey you. You all twisted up about Garret? Nerves ain't a sin, you hear me? Now you just follow the spirit as close as you can, he'll guide your path. 'Cause the devil's gonna do his damnedest to ruin the goods you got coming your way. [water trickles] [water trickles] [dog barks] Hey, girl! How you doing? How you doing, sweet thing? Hmm? [sighs] Come to help? [dog barks] Bye. [door opens] Sorry, Mara, I thought there was more. It's fine. Still no word from your mama? I'm sorry, Dilly. Let's not talk about her, not today. - Okay. - All right. Better hustle up, then, see what these old hens have in the store for us. All righty. [women laugh] Two colic babies? She wouldn't feed them her milk, you ask me. And that Casey Jay. [women laugh] Curse on her poor mama, that girl. All right now, a proposal's been made. And as sisters of this community, we are charged with a serious business, an important decision. Figuring what kind of woman you hope to be and finding the man who's gonna help you do it. Think Connie Ray missed that point last time around. All right, hush up. Harold ain't so bad. So we'll spend the rest of the morning making the quilt and by sundown, Mara's mind must be made on Garret Booner. Oh, it's the young 'uns you got to keep a watch for. They barely bit me, still took my thumb. Holy Ghost shine through me more than once. No doubt about that. What about that boy you raised? [Zeke sighs] All right. Let's get after it, then. [Man] Last spring there was some down here. [man sighs] You hear that? [snakes hiss] Hiding in those rocks, who knows how many? Well, I ain't gonna let you leave here emptyhanded. Go on. [Garret pants] [snakes hiss] Now remember, we respect the serpent but we do not cower to it. Go on, son. -[snakes hiss] -[Garret pants] [Garret sighs] [snake hisses] [Garret gasps] [snake rattles] [door opens] So this is where you ran off to. Needed a minute, I guess. Can't seem to rid myself of the damn things. My only vice. But we all got our sins, don't we? You know, I lived a whole lifetime before I found this place. For years I was lost, wasn't anybody looking for me. But that's what it's like off this mountain. Buncha dumb sheep, just wandering in the dark. And that's when Zeke found me and brought me here. - He found you a shepherd. - Mm-hmm. 'Cause who you choose, girl, chooses your whole life. Guess that's why I'm circling. 'Cause when the devil creeps in, shrinking you down, taking your love, you need someone to see the truth even when you don't. Well, I'll leave you to it. [sighs] Augie? You shouldn't be here. [Augie] Don't, Mara. Don't what? Don't talk to me like I'm someone else. I'm sorry, I just don't know why you're doing this. Making it harder. Making what harder? Mara. You used to say we was like the wind, 'member? No beginning, and no end. I know. But things were never supposed to get this far. And they can't go any further. I mean, we're never gonna make any sense. We are the only thing that makes any sense in this goddamn place. What's keeping us apart ain't even real, your daddy, his religion, it's got nothing to do with us. It's not just his, it's mine too. I've got the same spirit in me, why don't you see that? I'm the only one who does see it, okay? I know who you are, Mara. You don't know anything. [Augie sighs] [footsteps creak] Shoot, Mara, you got to hurry. I'll hurry, don't worry. Still want me to braid your hair? Yeah. All right, come sit. [girls laugh] So you made up your mind, did you? You gonna braid my hair or stick your nose in? Fine. [laughs] Well, I mean, he'll probably treat you nice. Garret's a good man. He hears the spirit in a way that I can't even, you know? Mm-hmm. I just thought... [Mara] What? Maybe you didn't like him much. I like Garret. Maybe it's just time that I grew up and choose a life for myself, and it ain't just a matter of choosing for this life, is it? And you should think about that too. [sighs] Braid's done. I'll be downstairs. Your mama's dress. My, you look just like her. Could hardly believe it fit. But you ain't her. The Holy Ghost never saw you as a stranger. Now go and take that off. - Praise God today, amen? - Amen. Well, I'm not gonna preach much today. I just wanted to say a few words about my daughter. The Lord... He tested her at a very early age, taking her mama. But Mara has turned into a fine girl. And a good man, a Holy Ghost man, has asked for her hand. So then, you settled on it? My answer is yes. [congregation exclaims] Hey, Augie. You ain't at the party with everyone? Just tired, that's all. Yeah, ain't much in a dancing mood either. Come on, I can drop you. All right, thanks. We're hooked up off the edge of the pastor's lot. Oh, well, ain't that something to hear. There's a lot more to him, you know. If you just let yourself find out. Why don't you just shoot where you're aiming, Dilly? Just be nice to see you at worship. Yeah. -[Mara vomits] -[toilet flushes] [Mara pants] Mara? Your dad and I are heading out. ♫ Love came that morn ♫ ♫ Now it's faded out of sight ♫ ♫ I keep living and losing ♫ ♫ That's how it used to be ♫ They must have been waiting for us. Just let 'em pass. God's on our side, boy, remember that. Mara? Mara? - What? - There's trouble at the church. What is it? - Wait, what are you doing? - You coming? They walked into our house, into God's house, and they took the very thing that allows us to show our devotion to him, our love for him. [crowd murmurs in agreement] And why? Because they don't understand it. Because they look down on it. Because they look down on it, they look down on you! On you and you and you! But our struggle is not against flesh and blood. It's not against the man who stands in our path. Our struggle is against the devil that put him there, amen? [All] Amen. But our God, our God is a conqueror and our belief in him is a sword against those that would undo us, amen? [All] Amen. And this mountain? This mountain is our shield. [crowd murmurs in agreement] Excuse me. [crowd murmurs] Your hands aren't meant for driving, you know that. I got scared you was in trouble like last time. Garret wouldn't allow it. He said the serpents were his. How long will they keep him? I can't say. He's gonna lose his job at the weld, that's for sure. Come on, let's go home. [someone knocks] [someone knocks] [Dilly grunts] Morning, Dilly. Pastor. Is everything all right? Everything's fine, Dilly, just came to check in on you, that's all. Oh. Jolene still gone? Yeah, gone for about a month now. Dishes been spoiling for a while. Yeah, for too long. Yes, sir. But that ain't on you, girl, do you understand me? And you ain't got to drown in it no more and you gonna stay with us from now on. [Dilly laughs happily] A child ain't meant to be separated from her blood, but your mama... She made her choice a long time ago. Now you got a choice you got to make. She can't be a part of you no more. Well, what if she comes back? Well, then she'll come back to an empty house 'cause there ain't gonna be nothing here for her. You understand me? Yeah. [Lemuel] All right, then, I'll leave you girls to it. [Dilly] Hey, can I ask you something? [Mara] Mm-hmm? It's just... My ma never told me much. About what? Well... You know what happens before a wedding can take place? [Mara sighs] I'm supposed to see Sister Slaughter, that's all I know. Oh. [Mara gasps in pain] Did you hurt yourself? Garret, you're back. I didn't expect you so soon. Even a week in jail's hard on a man. I'm afraid the troubles ain't over yet. Tell me if I hurt you? They came for us before. They tore up the church, took Daddy in the middle of the sermon. I don't know how long he was gone. I was little, so a while I guess. Must've been scary. Garret. What you did for the church, for Daddy... Thank you. [laughs] I did it for you, Mara. You must know that. Now I love your daddy and the church, well, the church gave me a new life, you know. It drove the demons from my heart. But it is you that keeps 'em gone. Ain't never laid eyes on something so pure. I would do anything to keep you, Mara. Anything. [Garret laughs] Jesus shed blood for us. For our healing. He died on that cross to break the devil's power. [crowd murmurs agreement] Now the devil, the devil, the devil, the devil. The devil has made home in this little boy, in this little child of God. - But the Lord can save him. - That's right. - Oh, yes he can. - That's right, that's right. [Lemuel sighs] Now we must not be deceived by the lies of the material world. The Lord is the only medicine that this boy needs, amen? [All] Amen. Look at me, son. [sighs] I say out, sickness, I say get out, get out, get out, devil, Get out, you have no place here, let the Holy Ghost shine through, heavenly father, shine through him, clean his heart, clean his lungs, get out... [speaks in tongues] Get out, get out, get out! Mara, you'll see Sister Slaughter first thing in the morning, you hear me? Yes sir. [door knocks] All right, stand up then. Go on, lay back. Why? There's a process has to happen before a wedding can take place. We all had to go through it, come on. Okay, hold yourself there now. [Mara grunts uncomfortably] You can sit up. Leave us? [door closes] Does Garret know? I suppose your daddy doesn't neither. No. Best keep it that way for now. [water trickles] Thank you, oh Lord, for this bounty. May it nourish our bodies as you have nourished our souls. In Jesus' name, amen. - Amen. - Amen. Mmm, mmm. That's good. [laughs] What's rustling you, girl? You all right? Think I'll turn in. You know how females are, always getting riled up about something. Damn, this is good, Dilly. [laughs] Just wait til you try the sweet potatoes. That's where I'm headed. Mmm. [Dilly laughs] [sander drones] Hey. Hey. Hey! Hey. Didn't mean to interrupt. No. Everything okay? [Mara sniffles] Everything's just so mixed up right now and I'm trying to see it and I'm trying to see his plan, what I'm meant for, but I can't see it. - Hey, hey, hey. - I can't see anything. It's all right, come here, it's all right, it's okay. [Mara sobs] I'm sorry. Mara, Mara, don't. I think you should just go, okay? I don't understand. Look, I'm trying real hard to do what you asked. To walk away? I got a place down in Leedsburg. Lined up a job. You're leaving? Yeah. I mean, there's nothing left for me here. I better let you get back to it, then. Maybe I'll see you before you go. Yeah. Okay. [sander drones] [door opens] You been messing around with the pastor's daughter? What? No, Mama, I got to go. She's pregnant. What? You tell me, is that your baby, August? My God. You could burn for this. Just leave God out of this for once, Ma, please. You'll be punished in this life and the next. Stop! God'll have another man raising up your own, claiming yours for his. Don't say that! You have to repent, you have to beg for forgiveness or he will deny you as you have denied him. Okay, you have to make this right, August, please. You have to. [Augie] Hey. Hey. I'll take one of those too. Of course. Thank you. You know, I took a walk in nature this morning, my property, and I just looked and I listened. He calls to us, the Holy Ghost does, whispering in voices in the wind, in the rain, in the serpent's rattle. But if you get quiet, you can hear him. Can you hear him? [snakes hiss] I do. I do. [crowd whispers in surprise] Why, the Lord calls a child of our church home. Come on up here, Augie, come on up here, he is calling. [crowd whispers] Are you ready to submit yourself before the Holy Ghost? Yes, I am. Hallelujah. [crowd murmurs in appreciation] Praise Jesus, hallelujah, praise God. [snake hisses] Thank you, Jesus. [snake hisses] Holy Ghost. Praise be to God. Thank you, Jesus. Praise be, thank you, Jesus. - Hallelujah. - Thank you, Jesus. [snake hisses] [Augie gasps] [snake hisses] [Augie gasps in pain] Okay. ♫ Up from the grave he arose ♫ ♫ A mighty triumph o'er his foes ♫ ♫ He arose a victor ♫ ♫ From the dark domain ♫ ♫ And he lives forever ♫ ♫ With his saints to reign ♫ ♫ He arose ♫ ♫ He arose ♫ ♫ Hallelujah ♫ ♫ Christ arose ♫ [Augie] It burns, oh, God, it burns, it burns so bad. [Augie sobs] Okay, let's see how bad it got you. [Augie whimpers] Please, I need a doctor, please, please. A doctor ain't gonna do nothing for you, son. Only an honest faith is gonna get you through this, Augie, an honest faith and your belief in him. He's asking you to believe in him, son. Believe in him. [Augie sobs] Ma, Ma, please, please. Please. Please. You listen to your pastor, boy. [Augie sobs] You have to save your breath for your prayers. You're being tested. We're all being tested. Come. [Augie sobs] Jesus, we pray that you'll hold him and you'll surround him and he's loved, in this moment. [Lemuel prays inaudibly] [Augie sobs] Came to see if you needed anything. No, darling, just prayers. And rest, best we go downstairs and give it to him. Oh, God. [Augie pants] [Augie sobs] The Lord said when there are two or more gathered in my name, there will I be also. Let us lift up our dear Augie with a song of our Lord Jesus Christ, help him beat the devil that is cutting like acid through his veins. You remember, the devil made a home in this young child, young Jed's lungs, and the prayers had cast him out? He cut himself trying to get rid of the venom. Those were your prayers that saved this innocent child and the Lord will hear our call again. He will join in our song. Let the prayer of the faithful raise the one who is sick and the Lord will heal him, in Jesus' name, amen. [All] Amen. He's gonna be fine. Just cut a little too deep, is all. Better stitch him up quick. We got clean rags. - Can't keep still. - All right. I can do it. Um, is he gonna be okay? Hush now, girl, let's let them do this with a little privacy. You as good as lied to me. Let me thinking Garret was the daddy of that baby. I couldn't find my way to the truth of it. Well, God's punishing you both now. [group murmurs indistinctly] Mara's still tending to him? Well, we all got to do our part. Think she's done more than enough now, Lemuel. We're a community, son, and he needs her help. Poor boy was asking to go to the hospital. He goes to town, the law'll be here in no time. It'll be for you. Well, then pray, and quiet your heart because mine ain't even whispering. [sighs] Mara. Mara. [Mara gasps] I've got to tell the others you're awake. You have to help me. [Mara] I have to tell the others you're awake. No, no, don't, stay, listen, listen, I need a hospital, please, I ain't gonna make it otherwise. Don't say that. The Holy Ghost called to you in the night and you heard him. He called to you, you heard him. - No. - He ain't gonna abandon you. Listen to me. I didn't hear the Holy Ghost, okay? I never have. Mara, I did it for you. Please, Mara, I will die here, you have to help me, please. - Please. - I think you better rest, okay? [Augie sobs] And if you won't pray, then I will. Okay, okay, okay, then can you at least just do it here with me? What in Christ-- What are you up to, girl? - Get off me. - You tell me. Take your goddamn hands off her. - Get off me. - You tell me, what are you up to, you tell me. That's enough, boy! Devil's at work here, poisoning her, poisoning you. Now you take yourself home, girl, too. Come on. Go. You will stay away from him and that house. [Garret pants] Mara? What are you doing? Just listening to the wind. [hisses] I made you a plate if you're hungry. Thanks, Dilly. Mara? Where are you going? Looking in on Augie. You coming? Oh, you're gonna be the death of me. - Yeah, I'm coming. - Hurry. [car approaches] Do you hear that? Morning, Pastor. I ain't got business with you, Dilly. Get in the car, Mara. [Augie whimpers] Thought he'd find his way out of it by now. I'm so sorry. Sorry? My boy's still fighting, what are you sorry for? I... It's... It's just sad seeing Augie this way. Go on, finish your prayers. [Hope pants] [truck approaches] This ain't gonna end well for you, son. She'll settle down after the wedding. Not if you don't start acting like a man. Teach her to be a wife, it ain't my place to. That's God's law, that ain't mine. [water runs] [Mara sniffles] [faint country music] Mara? Better get the soaking tub. [faint country music] Mara? Go on. [faint country music] [Mara sighs] There are limits to what I'll let you do to me, Garret. This is our fault, Zeke. We let him slip away. Just sat here. Waiting by as the devil hisself crept into his heart. And now we're gonna lose him, we're gonna lose our boy. He ain't gonna make it through another night. Not with that arm, he ain't. Zeke, what are you saying? I'm saying we ain't gonna stand by no more. But it ain't supposed to be up to us no more. The spirit must run his course. God took your thumb, wasn't your daddy. He would've if he had to. Dilly, how is he? He's got that look on him, same as the rest. No, he made it through the first night. You best say your goodbyes. I know you two was close. [Mara sighs] I'm sorry. [Mara sobs] This is my fault. Not his, I'm the one that should be punished. Hey. Loving somebody ain't a sin, Mara. It's all right. You don't understand. [Dilly] What? I got his baby in me. Oh, no. Oh. Mara. [dog howls] [dog howls] [Garret howls] [Garret howls] Would y'all go get him? Tonight ain't the night for that kind of behavior. I'll go get him. [door creaks] Garret. [Garret howls] Hey, there you are. [Garret sighs] The pastor send you to get me or... Do you just love me? [laughs] Please, Garret, stop, what are you doing? Stop acting like that. Oh. [laughs] Okay, Dilly Pickett telling me how to act. [laughs] Okay. This ain't about me. Mm-hmm. I came to talk to you. Go on. What important thing do you have to tell me? Um... Go on, little bird. It's about Mara. What about Mara? I'm worried that she's losing herself. She ain't listening to the spirit no more. What makes you think that? Because of Augie. Better go on, tell me. Matthew 7 tells us to ask and it shall be given. Heavenly father, I am asking you to reach your strong hands inside this young man's heart to be his strength in his time of need. [door creaks] You trying to make a fool of me, huh? No. Everything that I got, mm-hmm, everything that I am, I fucking gave to you, Mara. All of it. I loved you, Mara. I loved you more than anything. Christ, I still do. But it is killing me. You're killing me. You understand that? - I'm sorry-- - Beauty, oh? Why'd you lie, huh, why'd you say that you loved me? I didn't. Whoa, whoa, hey. What'd you say? You're hurting me. What did you say? Garret, you're hurting me. -[Mara grunts] -[glass shatters] [both shout] Garret, Garret! What in God's name? You don't understand, just let me, let me-- [Lemuel pants] Lemuel, she's a whore, Lemuel. Hey, wait a minute, no, no, hey, hey, just wait a minute, no, hey, hey. You get outta here right now. No, you can't put this on me. Go or I swear to God I'll bury you. Don't put this on me, Lemuel. That's not my baby in her. [gun clicks] [gun fires] [door opens] [truck starts] [Lemuel pants] [Mara sobs] Daddy. It's time to get clean, girl. [Augie pants] Harold got more from the vet. Tell the boys we're ready. [snakes hiss] [Lemuel sobs] Satan seduced Eve. [sniffles] So that he could pollute all mankind. Woman is the first sinner and she must be cleansed. [snakes hiss] Come on, girl, come on and get clean. [door opens] [snake hisses] All right, let her get cleaned, let her get cleaned. By the serpent we'll purify you. By the serpent we'll cleanse you. The serpent will cleanse you. [snake hisses] Hold him down. Augie, I'm here, I'm here, boy. [knife whirs] [Augie sobs] [Hope sobs] [snake hisses] [snake quiets] [Lemuel sobs] The Lord has forgiven you. The Lord has heard your prayers. He has forgiven you, Mara. [Mara sniffles] Augie needs help, and not the kind that we can give him. Hey. You walk out that door, you don't come back. You understand me? Bye, Daddy. Mara, Mara? [Mara pants] What are you doing, girl? I come for Augie. He needs a doctor. What he needs is to find his faith and God'll answer. He won't, not Augie, he's not like us, he never was. I won't hear this, what you're saying'll put my boy under, bury him so deep Jesus himself won't find him. Hope. We ain't got no more time. He'll be gone before sunup. - That's enough. - No, it ain't, honey. We ain't got no more time. You told me that I needed to find someone who sees me like you see each other, through and through. [pants] That's Augie for me. And I aim to be that for him. And I ain't gonna let him down anymore. He asked me to take him off this mountain. That's what I'm gonna do, you hear? I hear you. Come on, keys in the truck. Come on. [Augie pants] [Hope] You're gonna be okay. [Augie moans]
