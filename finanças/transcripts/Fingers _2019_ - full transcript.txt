What do you want from me? What do you want from me?! - Hi. - Hi, what can I get for you? Can I please get one each of the two fritters. One lemon filled. One of the chocolate sprinkles. Yeah. And then can I get one each of the cakes, the blueberry and the cinnamon? Excuse me, what is that on your hand? It's a birthmark. Hey. Walter's missing a pinky. What? Well, Walter's pinky is gone. And he just shrugged, like, "Hey, no big deal." And I thought you should know because it's gone. Get him out of here. What? I can't do it, I'm just an intern and I don't have that kind of power and... You doing all right? Lizzy told me what happened. We're not firing our programmer. We will schedule a meeting. We'll talk about whatever needs to be talked about. He'll tell us what's going on and then he'll go back to making us money. Let's get someone else. We make a mental health app. Use it. You know, it's like he didn't want anybody to notice. Like, if he just ignored it, then we all would ignore it too. It was that weird. - Damn. - Yeah, the bone was showing. - Oh. - No bandage? - Ew. - No bandage. Jesus. No, there's nothing wrong with you, okay? If that happened to me, I would react exactly the same way. I wouldn't be that far behind. I hope he gets hit by a bus. Last week, there was this one day I walk into this shabby, little store, and I rang the bell, and I just kept waiting and I kept waiting and I kept waiting, and then this little guy just came in. Can I help you? He was just so small and he was so dark, and I just flipped out and I turned around and I ran out. What did he do? He blocked me into this parking space. Look, Amanda I know somebody that could really help you, all right? Dr. Scotty. All you have to do is look at me and tell me you want help. I'm not gonna go into detail with what I was struggling with, but it was a struggle, you know? It was bad. It was real bad. But, Amanda, you gotta know that fear is a monster. And you have to be willing to destroy the monsters. If you're willing, then you'll get better. Just let me know when you're ready for him. Or we can just get better by ourselves. No, I'll text you his number. What do you do, Pete? - What do you do again? - We make a mental health. Okay, so you guys could work together. No, or maybe not. What the fuck is your real problem? I don't think I'm in love with Peter anymore. Yes, you are. No, I'm not. And I have something growing inside of my body. I'm pregnant. Well, is it Peter's? Yes, of course, it's Peter's. Thank Jesus. I can't keep it. Why not? Because I'm a monster. Amanda, you are not a monster, okay? You need help. You're thinking stupid thoughts, but you can be smart. It's your choice. I don't think I really understand what the real issue is exactly. I already told you. I'm not ready to have a baby. What if there's something wrong with it? Maybe I wouldn't love it. You would. No, I read a story the other day about a woman who thought that her son's penis was too... - You are not that woman. - She held her son in a bathtub. - She drowned her own... - Amanda, stop. I'm not ready for this. You are. You're having false realities in your mind. You don't understand, these thoughts explode inside of me. If these thoughts were real things, I'd be missing body parts. They'd be all over the floor, and that would be really... Bad. But you have us, you have family. Open up. Look, Derrick used to eat his hair when he was little. And after we met, I caught him eating dirt at a family reunion. And once, I caught him eating, you know. What? It doesn't matter. He's cured. This guy is gonna change everything for you. Don't tell Derrick, okay? This is our secret. Okay. I swear on my nipples. Both of them? Yes. When I was a little girl, I used to raise my finger and point at people and laugh. What I used to laugh at, now, scares me. This next part is going to sound racist, but know that I am not a racist. Short, black men freak me out even more. The darker the skin color, the more my stomach turns when I look at them. I saw a tall woman with a short man the other day, and I instantly felt this pity for her. Maybe they're happy, but it just doesn't look right. I had a friend who had a baby, and I drove eight hours to see him. But he has Down syndrome. When I was 10 minutes away from her house, I just turned around and drove away. Do you speak with your friend? Did you ever see her baby? How long were you friends with her? I just cut her out of my life. I wanna kill these things that slip in my head like a snake. Each and every time they show up and leave, they take a piece of me with them. They own me. You wrote this? You look at that. It's just ink and paper, right? But know that there's ideas in there, little seeds you pick up with your eyes, and plant them in your brain and you let them grow. I want you to read that. Okay. It's only $50, but you're not paying for the words, you're paying for the seeds. The conversation we will have after you read that book will change your life. That's what books do. Just by that book being in your hands, you're already changing. You gonna be okay working with Walter today? Okay. Is he here? Yeah. Is everything all right? He's missing another finger. Do you have something to break this window? No. I can't see him. I cannot see him, okay?! I need you to get rid of him! I need you to get him out of here! I don't care! I just need you to get him - out of here, okay?! - Yeah, okay. I can't see him! Get him out of the hallway! And, Liz, text me when he's gone! Okay, okay. Hey, hey. Amanda. Walter's missing another finger. Whoa, what, what, whoa, whoa, what? He's missing another finger. Whoa, calm down, you're being hysterical. - What's going on? - I need you to go get him away, go! - What's going on? - Go make him go away. I need you to go, go! Make him go away! He's missing another finger. What? Okay. - Go, go! - Okay, I'm going! What happened to your hand? I sliced off another finger, all right? Some people never learn. I'm not Jesus. I'm never gonna be a carpenter now. I mean, who needs 10 fingers, right? Eight is enough. Used to watch that show all the time, with my sister. We loved it. You did this to yourself, that's your answer? That's my answer. Don't worry about my hand. Please? Just ignore it. He's missing another finger. It made me so sick. I had this sharp pain in my abdomen. It felt like a worm with razors for legs crawled up my body and burrowed into my stomach through my belly button. I couldn't stand up straight. I have something for you to sign. Tomorrow, you and your friend with the fingers will have a meeting. I have the perfect place in mind. Did you start my book yet? No. You've got to do that. Sometimes, what we feel, or what we see on a stage like this, can make us laugh. Sometimes, it can scare us. It can even cause anxiety for a little bit. But I want you to know that there is nothing to fear. There should be no fear. Amanda, I want you to close your eyes, and you're going to feel something. Whatever you feel, it's not real. Open your eyes, Amanda. No, I can't. No! No. Can't, I can't, I can't. One day, you're gonna open your eyes and see the truth, and you will not be scared. It might even put a grin on your face. Walter, tell Amanda there's nothing to be afraid of. Please, don't be scared of me. Walter, Amanda's being brave. We want you to be brave too. So go ahead, Walter, tell us the truth. I recently bought a table saw. Oh, Christ, no! I wanted to make those animal shapes, put them around my yard. And Jesus was a carpenter, I thought maybe I could be a carpenter too. Walter, you're saying you had an accident. First, you lost your pinky. You have another one, and then you lost another one. Tell us the truth, Walter. They keep coming back. They just show up, out of nowhere. They slip in like a snake. Once they're there, they just laugh and play and they dance. They just show up. And when they leave, they take a part of me with them! They take a part of me with them! Okay, Walter, I need you to sign something for me. Maybe you can use the other hand. He's cutting off his own fingers. Would you like to help me save him? But what were those things that he was talking about? It's his psychosis. They're not real. But what if they are? He'd call the cops. But what if he was too afraid? He'd call them anyway. Amanda, what is this worth to you? I mean, think about this morning, think about yesterday, think about right now. It could be anything, from 100 to $2,000. It's whatever you want, more or less. Okay. You're gonna be all right. I'm not being an asshole. Clearly, something is wrong. This book is starting to help me think. Read a passage out loud. "Now that you have the key, I want you to get closer. "Shock yourself. "If God himself was watching you, "I want you to shock him too." What does that even mean? It's saying be brave. You are brave. It's telling me to get close to my fears, to look at them. I froze when I saw Walter come on to that stage, but when we left, I didn't feel cold anymore. This is a bear. I saw it today and had to get it for you. Bears are warriors. You're a bear now, a brave bear, and you can fuck up whatever it is that you want to fuck up. I love you. I'm sorry for being a dick. Throw away the book. If you fear flight, spend a day at the airport. Spend all day at the airport. Think about every soul that passes by. This will be the last page you read today. You have an assignment now. Go out and chase the fear. Hey, Walter. No! Walter, don't fight, don't run. Goddammit. Get him up here. ♪ Ring around the Walter ♪ ♪ Gonna cut his thumb off ♪ How old are you, Walter? Huh? I mean, what I'm getting at there is, aren't you a little old to be jumping around on a trampoline? It's kinda weird. It's fun. I'm having fun. It's gonna be fun. Hey! Come on. Wearing myself out here. Come on, buddy. It's fine, there we go. Yeah. Upsy-daisy. In you go. Ready? Breathe. - No, no! - Breathe, Walter. - One. - No! Two. Shit! Oh, my god, that thing just popped right off. I followed them home last night. I know where they live. There you are. Fucking door. This shit is so dope, man. Yeah. I'm making some more. You make this shit? Yeah. What? Nothing, it's just, you know, if I didn't know you, I mean... If I saw you doing this, I... You'd what? I would think you were a real faggot. Maybe I am. Shit. My grandma used to do this. So I got a question. Before I go again, I need to get paid. You know how much this beer cost? You ever spend $14 on a beer? Yeah, I'm a Natty Ice guy. No disrespect, but I don't drink that pussy shit. Yeah. See, people look at me and they see one thing. You know, the way I live, what I look, but then, you know, I can sew and spend $14 on a 12% alcohol German beer that's been aging for four years, and it's complicated. I'm a complicated person. Yeah, you are. You're not. You're simple. You do what you're told. You'll drink whatever piss they put in a can. Ain't that right? Guess so. You wanna try it? Nah, I'm good, man. Oh, fuck! What the fuck, man?! Oh, fuck! - Oh, fuck! - Can't say faggot anymore, man. What the fuck?! Oh, fuck. Bastard. Jesus fucking Christ. Jesus fuck. I got 'em. Sit down. You're one of three things: stupid, which will get you killed; funny, and that'll get you killed last; or just crazy, which is okay as long as you don't get yourself killed. You know, everybody saw you walking across the lot with this baggy of fingers. Nobody saw shit. I'm not stupid. I am funny, though. Let's see. An index, a middle, a ring finger, and a pinky. Where's the thumb? I need these fingers for what I'm doing. Okay, it's kind of a funny story about the thumb, actually. Let me tell you. I like my stories like my women, short and sweet. Okay, look, this kind of work, what you got me doing, it's not me. Okay, you know, this is not who I am, you know? I'm not, I don't do this. I have to build up to it, you know? I have to get there, here. Short and sweet. Where's my fucking thumb?! Mm! Oh, I forgot about there's a bone in there. I don't even eat bone in wings. Oh, the nail! Oh, come on, man. Mind over matter. I ate the thumb. Right in front of him, I just. When I hired you, I wasn't sure you were right for this job. Clearly, I was wrong. Thank you. Uh, so my partner's been bothering me about money. Later. Next time, shoot a video. I wanna watch him squirm. Okay. Yes, sir. Scott, listen to me. We're gonna drop the black Dr. Phil thing, okay? Instead of having a whole bunch of people come to you, we're just gonna have one. For a whole season, it's gonna be you and her. I'm still the main guy, right? I mean, it's still my show, right? Not her show. It's your show, baby. It's called "Dr. Scotty," okay? The show is still yours. Listen, close your eyes. I want you to feel something, okay? She's gonna be mulling through all her fears, and you are gonna be right there with her, right by her side, whole way. The audience is gonna wanna know what's gonna happen next with Amanda. What's she gonna do? Where are those dominoes gonna fall? What's Amanda gonna do next? Something scary? Something sexy? Is she gonna kill somebody? Is she gonna fuck a lot of guys? Let's hope so, but we don't know. 'Cause what I'm talking about right now is suspense. I record all my sessions. I have hundreds of tapes. All kinds of people. It's the "Dr. Scotty" show. Don't worry about that, all right? Have you seen the guy that eats shit? You should be talking to her right now. We should be on the phone with her, and you should have your camera and we should be recording her right this second. Scotty. Scotty. What are we missing? Start your journey. Amanda. Amanda. You changed me, Walter. We're changing each other. You know, I took a little piece of you. It started growing all those years ago inside your mama's belly, and has been with you your whole life, and I've put it inside me. And then my body took what it needed, took all the nutrients, and just shit the rest out. I flushed a piece of your body today. I know who I am. I know what that makes me. I'm a monster. I eat people now, I guess. I guess that makes me a cannibal. I'm a cannibal now. I didn't even think about that when I was doing it. It only occurred to me today, when I shit you out. You fight us too much, Walter. I don't want any more fighting from. That's really the only reason I came over here tonight. God, you're so sweaty. Why do you sweat so much? Jesus, you sweat so much. Relax. There we go. Mm. Tastes like fear. Don't be afraid, Walter. Why don't we play a game? Hide and go seek. How do you play? Are you being truthful with me right now, Walter? Yes. You never played hide and go seek? Not even when you were a kid? No. Who are you? I'm just a man. I'm very scared. Well, what did you do? Nothing. No, you did something. - No, I didn't do nothing. - You did something, buddy, or I wouldn't be here. Please leave me alone. No. No. Let's play. And hey, if you hide well enough, maybe we'll never find you. Go hide, Walter. Go! Go hide. You're first. Come on. I'm gonna count to 10. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. 10! Ready or not, here I come. Really, Walter?! - The fucking closet again? - I'm sorry. You can't keep hiding in the closet, Walter. You can't keep hiding in the closet. It's a simple game, and you're ruining the game. You're ruining the game. You just fucking hide, then we find you. Hide somewhere different next time. You know what this fucking reminds me of? Reminds me of this fucking prick I used to know in high school. He was always ruining shit, ruining jokes, ruining games, ruining fucking magic trick... Shh! Shh. Hey. Go, go answer the door. Walter, who's at the fucking door? Go look out the window. Hey, you're not fucking moving, buddy. Go. Did you bring your gun? You can talk now, asshole. So fucking scared right now. You're gonna pay for this. Shh. Walter. Shh. Walter, shut up! Goddammit. Are they gone? Are they gone? You must take something from wherever your fear lives. You take this. You keep this. This is going to power you for your journey. Hey. Come on, hey. Okay. Yo, man! You here? Hey, buddy, you in here? Where the fuck did you go? Yo, man, you back here? Yo, man, what's... - Oh, shit! - Oh, god, I'm sorry! - Who are you?! - I'm just a friend! - I'm sorry! - Hey, wait, listen to me. Come back! If that guy that I fucked last night knew you saw my tits, he'd kill you! I didn't see your tits, lady! - What the fuck?! - If you say that you saw me, he's gonna think we fucked! - I - didn't see shit, lady! Amanda, take the dog. Toad boy! Toad boy! Toad boy! Toad boy! Toad boy! Aw, hell yeah. Toad boy! Come on, boy! Toad boy! Come on, boy! Hey! What the fuck? Buy a new dog. You don't just buy a new fucking dog. A dog is like a person. You kill people. Well, yeah, but I don't kill dogs! Worse. Worse? Fox, look, someone's spying on us, okay? Don't worry about it. Just tell whoever it is you bought in on this job the job is over. Tell them to go away. I'll call you later. No, look, it's the fingers guy, okay? He's talking. He's telling somebody, and he knows who we are. The fingers guy doesn't know shit. He's so meek. I mean, it's pathetic. I mean, is he really that bad? What could he have done to you, huh? I wanna know why I'm cutting his fucking fingers off. When you do business with a guy like me, you do business. When the business is over, you take your money and you go away. Now go away, now. Please? I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go find out where my fucking dog is! I once knew a man who liked to play with fire. I burned him alive. Oh, you did, did you? You burned him alive? Is that a threat? You fucking threatening me? I'll burn you alive, do you hear me? I'll fucking burn you alive! And I'll burn Walter McFucking Fingers alive. I'll burn the whole goddamn world alive. And then I'll saw on the field while it burns. Fuck you, old man. Fuck you! Hey! Want your cash? Fuck. Yeah. I need that. Apologize. I'm sorry. It's my fucking dog. Use your head. One of your stupid friends is trying to rip you off for money. What? No. No. It's one of your friends, and that kinda scares me. Pisses me off at the same time. Think about it! Use your head! I don't know who you stole that dog from, but there is no them. It's fake. Amanda, I'm going to say something and I don't want you to get offended. But did you know that someone's psychosis can be contagious? Walter is cutting off his own fingers. This is what he sees in his mind. And because he's telling you this, you're seeing it too. They're not real. I didn't see her tits, bro. I swear to God, I didn't touch her. What? Where's my dog? Your dog? Yeah, yeah, yeah, my dog. Where's my dog? What'd you do with my dog? Who rang the doorbell the other night? The fuck are you talking about, man? Look, I know what you're doing, you little fuck! And I'm desperate, man. I mean, I'm desperate. My soul is in fucking ashes about my dog, man! I love my fucking dog! I didn't touch your dog, bro. I fucking love dogs. I mean, a man's best friend is his fucking dog. Everybody knows that shit. Like... Hey. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, look at me. Just tell me you took my dog. Tell me you took my dog to try to make a little extra money, okay? - I didn't. - No, hey, come on. You took my dog and you sent a friend over to ring the doorbell, just say that. You're fucking crazy. No, no, no! No, listen, just say it and I'll let you go, okay? Hey, come on... I know, I know you didn't take my dog, but I wanna hear you say it, okay? I wanna hear what it sounds like in here. Don't cut my fingers off. Just... - Hey, hey, hey, hey! - Don't cut my fingers off. Don't cut my fingers off. Look, tell me that you took the dog, okay? And that it was all a fucking joke and that you didn't hurt him, okay?! Just tell me that, all right? And tomorrow, he's gonna come back and he's gonna be fine, everything's gonna be fine! Say it, say it, just like that. My fingers, - don't cut my fingers. - Don't what, don't what, - don't what? - Cut my fingers off. Cut your fingers off?! Is that what you think I do?! You think that's my thing?! I'm not gonna cut your fingers off. I won't, I promise. I won't cut your fingers off. I know where your dog is, bro. What's that? It was just playing a prank. Your dog is alive and well. Where is he? - I think... - Where's he at?! You have to find him. It's part of the game that the old man you know wanted to play with you. He wanted to fuck with you. I don't know why! Man, the fucking old man. Son of a bitch. Of course, you're telling me the truth. No, man, I'm just role playing. No, no, no, oh, my god, the old man, the fucking old man! Oh, that makes so much sense. No, I was making shit up. You told me to make it up! Oh, bullshit you're making it up! No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on, man, I was just making shit up! Come on. Where's he at?! I don't know, man. Maybe your girlfriend took it! Maybe she was fucking mad at you! I knew, too, a girl that killed my fucking cat when I broke up with her. Girls be freaking out when you fuck with their hearts, bro! - Bitches be freaking out, man! - Bitches, they be freaking out, I know! But I don't got a bitch. I don't have a girlfriend. Look, just tell me what you said was true, okay? Tell me, I know it was. It's over, just tell me. Tell me! Fuck! Tell me the truth right now! Your dog suffered. We cut and gut him slow. Your dog is dead. We burned his eyes. We were gonna fuck with you first, but we started poking your dog with a machete. He was so scared. We laughed so fucking hard. You're telling me the fucking truth, aren't you, you're telling me the truth! Instead of using him for ransom, we were having too much fun killing him. Oh! We did to your dog what you did to that fucking guy. One little paw at a time. You deserved it. You deserved it, you psychotic fuck! You deserved it, you fuck! You fucking asshole! - You fucking... - Yeah, there's the truth! Now we got the truth! Gonna fucking die and I don't fucking care! Just... Look, it's the guy's house. Just protect him. No, don't break in. Just wait for him to show up. Look! I have to do that! You have to do what? Kill my fears! Okay. What does that mean? Read the last chapter! Sorry, man. I didn't hear you come in. My name's Big Ted. I'm gonna make sure you're okay, make sure nobody fucks with you. Sorry about breaking into your place. Who sent you? I got you, you're safe with me. Oh, shit. - Shit what? - Oh, shit. Come on, come on, come on. - Shit what? - Come on, come on. Get in your room, get in the back, get in the back, it's going down! - What's going down? - Get in the back, come on. - What's going down?! - Oh, shit! Oh. Today! Walter! Wins! Walter. I'm impressed. I did this to him. I'll do this to you. Have a seat. You're a pussy. Hey, what's with all this shit? What are you, planning to booby trap the house? What gave you that idea? I was watching "Home Alone." "Home Alone"? Oh, god, that's so cute. Who are you? Nobody. Well, listen, Walter, don't think for a second I'm not enjoying the fuck out of this, because I am, okay? But I'm not here tonight as the crazy Talky Panda man, okay? I'm here as me. And I need to ask you a question, so you need to sit the fuck down. Sit down, Walter. Holy shit! Oh, look at what you did to Big Ted's head. Thank you. I mean, this guy was here for me. Hey, isn't it ridiculous that the guy that's paying me to cut your fingers off is paying this guy to come here and stop me from cutting your fingers off? I mean, what the fuck have we gotten ourselves into, Walter? Hey, listen, I know I ain't so pretty without my mask, but just be nice to me, okay? And I'll take this big guy with me when I go. Hell, I'll even clean up the mess. Just tell me what you know. Who's calling? I don't know. Hello? This is Walter's phone. Ding dong. One more finger and your dog is gone. Who is this? I'm the mama bear. You fucking listen to me... Who the fuck is outside, Walter? I don't know! Don't you fucking... Come here. Get over here. Let's fucking find out who this is. Hello? Ding dong. One more finger and... Fuck you! I own you. And if you don't listen, I can kill you. Are you gonna fucking kill me?! Fuck you! On your fucking knees. On your knees, Walter! You listening to this? You listening to this?! You're gonna fucking kill me, huh?! Lay down, Walter! Lay down! Oh, shit. One more fucking finger! Give me my fucking dog! No! Fuck am I fucking... Walter. Walter. Walter, are you okay? Go, please! - I'm sorry, Walter. - Go. I'm sorry, Walter. What did I fucking do? Let me see. What did I do? Oh, god! Walter, what did I do that for?! I'm so fucking stupid! You have one finger? You still have one finger, though, right? Hey, hold on. - Please, please. - Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, I have a plan. I can fix you. I can fix you, listen. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, I'm gonna choke you. - No. - You're not gonna die, okay? You're not gonna die, you're just gonna pass out. And when you wake up, you're gonna call your friend and you gotta tell them that I fixed you, then they can give me my dog back, okay, 'cause I'm gonna put your fingers back on. I'm gonna put your fingers back on so they're gonna give me my dog back, Walter. Walter, I'm sorry. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck! How far is Walter? He's up the trail right here. Why don't we just knock on his front door? We're not here to see Walter, we're here to see the monsters. You don't need that! Yes, I do! Come on! My name is Fox, not Mr. Fox, not Dr. Fox, not The Fox. Just plain old Fox. And I'm here for a reason. What happened to you was supposed to happen to this prick fuck lawyer. It was a silly mistake. I came here today for your forgiveness. I don't wanna just hear your forgiveness. I need to feel it. I'm getting better. What's that? This is going to help us with the healing. Let me get a good look at our surroundings. This is Amanda. She's going to show us her fears today. Hey, I'm Amanda Flynn. And today, I'm gonna kill my fears. All right. The work I do, and the people I do it with, is so wrong. I kill people. I've killed many. But I hate it when somebody who has nothing to do with this gets dragged in and made to suffer the consequences. Innocent people shouldn't know anything about our life. Our job is tough, but we chose it. Like, coroner, he has a tough job, but he chose it. But it just isn't right for somebody who has nothing to do with this to have to suffer like this. I don't know how I can make this up to you, but I need to, I desperately need your forgiveness. How did this happen? I just wrote the address wrong. Amanda, that's a loaded gun you're playing with right now. Who you gonna shoot? Where do you want me to hide? He's right there. Just hide, just hide. Amanda. It's not real, Amanda, it's fake. Amanda, I'm here to help you. It's all in your head. Hi. I'm Dr. Scotty. You can just call me Ryan. I'm nobody. I'm just a man walking down a nature trail, enjoying the trees and the sunshine, that's all. I'm gonna walk right past you and you're gonna let me go. This is fascinating. You look so real. What is that? It's a hundred-dollar gift card to Best Buy. I, at the time, was thinking, "Ah, 10 bucks a finger." After seeing what's been done to you, I clearly see I've made a big mistake. I was just so wrong. I wasn't thinking. I just... I don't know. I need to do more for you. You're scaring me right now. It's not me you want. I'm nobody! It's her! Look! Right behind you! Hey. The only reason you're not dead right now is that silly fucking smile on your face. Who are you? I'm the one at your yoke. Oh, my god. What would it take... What can I do for you? An eye for an eye. "An eye for an eye." You want my eye? I want nine of your fingers. My husband's pointing a rifle at you right now. Hey, I would look, but I don't quite trust you just yet. No, he is. He's got his rifle pointed at you right now. And I'm falling in love with him all over again, because honestly, I wasn't sure if I did love him, but I do. You're fucking crazy! Jesus Christ, you're crazy as me. You're like a spider. I hate spiders, always have. I never understood them, you know? They got so many legs. But now, now I think I'm starting to get it. And I want you to do something for me. I want you to do me a favor, okay? Please. I want you to fuck me. And then I want you to eat me. What do you say? Fuck me and eat me? Hmm? That's my one wish. Fuck me and eat me. Please. Please. Did you hear what he just said?! Yep. Found this while snooping through your stuff. Yeah, we're having a boy. I'm scared. I'm not, of anything. Think Dr. Scotty might be dead. No, he's not. Dr. Scotty didn't really follow me here. He's just a voice in my head. Congratulations, Amanda. You killed your fears. You want my fingers? Would that do it for you? Could you be satisfied if I gave you my fingers? You got a sink? Got a garbage disposer? Doesn't work. My hand is too big. Won't fit down the hole. I got a table saw in the shed. You could use that.
