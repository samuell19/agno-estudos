(dramatic music) (high-pitched alarm wailing) (explosion bangs) (horse neighing) - What's the matter? - [Lapporte] I've had enough of this damn digging. And that drunken bastard doesn't do a thing. - If you've had enough, then take off. - Everything looks real enough now for our claim. - Don't look real enough for the people who are supposed to believe that we've found gold. Do you understand? Let 'em think it's a mountain of gold. (explosion bangs) (mellow music) (dogs whining) - Good, good. Hello, hello. Go on. Good, good. (whip cracks) Go, go! Go, you huskies. Hey, hey! Hey! Go, you huskies! (speaking in foreign language) (mellow orchestral music) Hey! (whistling) Go, go! Go! Hey! Hey! - [Sanders] Help! Help! (gunshot bangs) Help! Don! It's me, Don! - Sanders? - [Sanders] I need help. - I'm coming. Ho, hey! Get moving, get in there. Go, go! Sanders, your leg, what happened? Where's Billy? - Billy, my son's down in the mine. He's trapped there. - Since when? - Dunno, three or four days? But Billy's still alive I can hear him. - [Don] How did it happen? - [Sanders] Oh, some boulders suddenly rolled down. I tried to move them but they're too heavy for me. - [Don] Sanders, I warned you not to take him. It's a pole of today Indians. It's sacred. - Hogwash! I don't believe in any taboos, in any Indian hocus-pocus. I believe there's gold there. And plenty of them. - Buck! Wait. Wait, Buck, hold on. Leave it. Okay, Buck, here we go. (grunting) - I'm coming, be patient, son. Hey Buck. Billy? Billy. (grunts) Go. I got you. (Billy groaning) Billy, Billy. You're hot. It'll be alright now, Billy. Sanders! - Billy. (Billy groaning) Billy. (Billy groaning) (Billy groaning) Is he? - No, no, he's got a very high temperature. He's gotta see a doctor right away. I'll take him to Paradise Creek. I'll take the sled across the glacier, down to Honie River. - Yeah. - There, I'll get a canoe and head to Camp Keno. I'll get some supplies from the store at Lonesome Corner. - That's sure real nice of you, Don. - Yeah. (Billy groaning) Let's move. There's long ways to go. (brooding music) (Billy groaning) - Thanks, Don. - Don't mention it. (brooding music) - Pa. - Get the best doctor in Paradise Creek. - You're not coming along? - No Don, I'm staying here. I'll just be in the way. Without me, you'll travel faster, you'll see. - [Don] But your leg, if you don't come with me, you'll get gangrene. - Two legs or one leg, doesn't matter. I ain't leaving here. There's gold here. And Billy's gonna have it better than I ever did. Take it for the doctor and you. - Not for me, for the doctor. - But you tell no one about the gold. No one has to know what I found here. - I won't tell anyone. I just saw the today Indians. They'll find out about it. - Don't worry, I've got Buck. - Okay, if that's the way you want it. We'll be back as soon as I can and bring some medicine for your leg. Here! (whistles) (yells) I'll be back in two days! (yelling) (mellow orchestral music) - Well boy, it's just you and me now. (yelling) (whistling) (speaking in foreign language) - Whoa. - [Man] My nuggets are in there. - [Mover] Then you found lead, not gold. Alright. (grunts) - [Man] Damn wheel. Can someone give me a hand here? - [Mover] There goes the rest of it. - 10 ounces. - [Cotton] Mr. Fox, 10 ounces. - Sheriff, I hope that you're aware every prospect in Camp Keno has given you for safekeeping. All the gold is mine in the last five months. - I'm aware, Fox. But I'll deposit it safely in the bank at Paradise Creek. Rose. - The last one. - Alright, I'll put it with the others. - Have we got it all up? - [Rose] Captain Brandy hasn't been here yet. - Tell him to hurry. As soon as Buffins get here, we'll start moving. We wanna make to at least north river it gets dark. Better go see what the captain's up to. - Alright, I'll get it. - [Man] I just can't free (grunts). - [Tinker] Come on, let me try again. - What's the matter, people? - It doesn't concern strangers especially a black man. - [Man] These aren't black. - [Man] Here it goes, once more now. (grunts) Oh, gee! - [Ham] Here let me give it a try. (grunting) - [Man] Hey, thank you, stranger. - My name is Ham. - [Man] How'd you get so strong? Eating corn pone? - [Cotton] How's it look, Buffins? - The trail at Lonesome Corner looks alright, Sheriff, but I can't swear the Bear Path is safe. - Well, we'll see when we get there. Worst come to worst, we'll cross over at Eagle Gorge. - Shall we move out, Sheriff? - No, just a few minutes more. Captain Brandy's late. - [Buffins] Again? - Captain Brandy. Captain Brandy. - What's the matter? - The transport is leaving. Only the captain hasn't brought his gold. Do you know where he is? - Of course, I know where he is. He's probably still sleeping. I'll go and look for him. At this hour, no one can talk to him, you know? (yells) Oh, hey, captain. - Ahoy! - Captain, the transport's leaving. - [Betty] Come on, get up. - Full steam ahead. Breakfast. - When do you you expect to send your money along? You have to hurry. - Second breakfast. - Captain, they're leaving without your gold. - I can't remember where to find it until I'm dead drunk. - How long is that? - Least, two or three bottles. - That's impossible. (laughing) - Then let them sail without my cargo. Ship ahoy! - Well, it's your gold. - Betty, my third breakfast. - [Man] Everything we own on this world's on that wagon. - I know. I'll defend it with my life if I have to. - Dad, you can go. The captain's not sending his gold along. - Okay, let's go. We wasted enough time. - Why isn't that old sop sending his gold along with the other men? Smells fishy to me. - That's enough of that. - [Man] Your own mother smells fishy to you, Tinker. - [Tinker] You can say that again. - [Man] Alright, out of the way. - Goodbye, Rose. - Dad, I'm afraid. - Nonsense, there's nothing to be afraid of. In about six days, I'll be back here. Don't worry. Let's go. Bye. Go! Alright, move! (man yelling) (people yelling goodbyes) (mellow music) - You wait here. I'll go ahead and scout around a little and see if we can use the Bear Path. - Good idea. - If I think we can get through without much trouble. I'll give a signal. Three pistol shots. - Alright, Buffins, see you later. - [Buffins] Later. - Hello, Shat. How about offering us a drink? - Ho, ho. If anyone around here knows whether the Bear Path is clear, that old geezer does. - Maybe, but he won't tell us. - Why not? - Because no one in the world has ever heard more than three words from old Shat. - [Man] What were they? - Come along and listen. Since when have you work for Lonesome Corner, Shat? - I don't recall. (men laughing) (mellow music) - You weren't born here, Shat. What did you do before you got here? - I don't recall. (men laughing) - [Don] Shat. - [Cotton] Hi, Don. - Oh, Cotton. Where are you headed? - We're going to Paradise Creek. - Cotton, this boy is very sick. He's got to see a doctor. Can you take him along? - Certain thing in the world, Don. What's more, he'll have the most expensive bed in the world. A bed of gold. Come on, let's go. - Yeah, I'd rather sleep on gold. Better than anything. - [Man] You can say that again. - [Buffins] Hello, boys. What's catching so long? - [Mark] I'll ask the questions. How many are there? - The sheriff, four men and deputy. - Not even too many for each of us. - Easy boy, slow don. You'll live a lot longer that way. We can ambush them right there. We'll catch them off guard like sitting ducks. How long before they get here? - About an hour. Hey! - [Mark] Let's go to work. (brooding music) Over there. (somber music) - For the doctor. - Don, why don't you come with us? - No, I can't. Billy's father has a bad leg. I have to go back. - Now, tell him there's no reason to worry about his boy. He'll have the best doctor there is on Paradise Creek. - Thank you. (gunshot bangs) - [Buffins] The Bear Path is all clear. - Alright, men, let's move on. Let's go, round up. (yells) - Shat. Shat, I need medicine. Medicine. Medicine. Medicine. - I don't recall. - Over there? Here? Shat, I'll take these. Here. It's more than enough. Thanks. - You know, if you ask me, it's pretty suspicious. The Bear Path being so quiet all of a sudden. - I agree with you. It's a real death trap, usually. No one knows we've come this way. - Yeah, I hope you're right. (grunting) - [Mark] Alright now, get out of sight. (suspenseful music) - [Cotton] Ho! Hey, couple of you guys, get up here and move that tree out of the way. - [Mark] Hands up. - [Robbie] Get off your horse. (gunshot bangs) (horse neighing) (gunshots bang) (grunts) (grunts) (grunts) (fast-paced music) (punches thudding) (somber music) - [Lapporte] Hey, we've got the gold. - [Buffins] Come here, Mark. - [Lapporte] What's the matter, boss? - My brother, Robbie, is dead. Get the horses. (Billy groaning) Well. - Ho! Where'd he come from? - He was in the wagon. - I didn't see him. - What kind of a man are you? The kid's sick. Come on, put the gold in the sandbags and let's take off. Robbie and kid come along. Buffins. - Yeah, boss? - Take your share. - [Buffins] Is this part of my share? - That wound wasn't planned. It will help make the people believe in your story. - [Buffins] Maybe. - [Betty] Here. - Thank you. Must be a pretty rich land here, we can ship at all that much old. - You want to by yourself a plane? But with that broken hand, you won't be able to do very much. - That's not broken? - So why is it in a sling if it's not broken? - Well, that's a long story, madam. Did you ever hear of Hammer Ham? - Nope. - Hammer Ham? He was the best boxer that ever was, real champ. - Thank you, mister. - Only he once had the bad luck to kill another fighter in the ring with a straight left. Pa! And the man was dead. - No, mister. With a right hook! - Huh? What makes you so damn sure? - Because it was this right hand that did it, mister. - What? (laughs) You, you're Hammer Ham? Man, you're making fun of a old seaman, aren't you? - I can prove it, mister. - Mister, Hammer Ham, that's the real one, would've busted the wooden barrel with good punch. We can bet that you can't. A barrel just like that one right there. - Woody now, wanna bet I can do it too? - [Brandy] Bragging, and you do it, I'll eat my hat. - You saw me, mister. - Hammer Ham. - [Man] He really is Hammer Ham. - Why do you hide your hand in a sling? - Well, it's just because, you see, if I don't hide my right hand in a sling, gonna kill else somebody else because when I give that right hook, there's bound to be a corpse. - Hey, what happened here? - He just opened a new barrel of whiskey. You wanna taste? - [Man] Hey! Hey! Deputy! - [Man] Hold him, hold him. - [Buffins] The transport. - [Man] What happened? What happened? - The gold transport was attacked. I got away but the others, the others, the others are all dead. - Dead? - All dead. The sheriff and the other men, all dead. - Give us a little water. - All dead. - Rose! Someone attacked the gold transport. - My father. - Buffins is the only one who. - I knew it, I had a hunch. - A hunch? Maybe you had something to do with it. - You damn fool, if I was in cahoots with him, would I have sent my gold along? - Yeah, that's true enough. - Yeah, but there's someone who didn't send his gold along like everyone else. - [Man] Yeah, the captain for instance. He still got his tugs away. - [Brandy] What are you talking about? - Listen, I have something to say. - You have nothing to say here. - I believe I do since we've no longer a sheriff. - What happened to my father? - He was, he was killed. (sobbing quietly) I won't need my badge now. No one will want me to be sheriff after this? - What do you mean? I say Buffins should be appointed sheriff. - [Tinker] That's right. (men talking over each other) - Then I demand that the new sheriff find out who the murderers are and see the guilty come to trial. - Swear, I'll do everything in my power, Rose. (mellow music) - [Mark] Ho! - What happened to Robbie? - He's dead. Take care of the youngster. We'll bury him over there. What about him? - I think that I can pull him through. - [Mark] Good. - Are you crazy, Mark? Let him die. That little bastard's dangerous for us. - We'll save him, Doc. They took my brother and gave me this little boy. - Hoo, ya! (speaking in foreign language) Ho, ho. (suspenseful music) (Sanders screaming) (gunshot bangs) - [Don] Achua! - [Achua] White man, I can see you. - I can only see a coward who has tried to kill a defenseless man! Who does not have courage to fight a free man with his knife in his hand. - Achua doesn't fight over a knife. What do you want? - That man there. That man is mine. We'll fight over him. That man is mine! - Go ahead. If you can defeat me, that man is yours. (suspenseful music) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) Kill me. - No! I won't kill. I just want your prisoner. Does he belong to me? - He belongs to you. (groaning) - Buck. Buck? Easy. Sanders, Sanders, they're gone. You'll be alright. I'll get my sled and take you to Paradise Creek. - I'm finished, Don. They burned me out first. That mine, everything's burned. What about Billy? - Out. - Billy, put my claim in his name. - I promise. I promise. - Look after Billy. - I promise. - Thank you. Remember your promise. (gasping) (somber music) (Buck whining) - Lost a good friend, didn't you, Buck? I know. And Billy, we'll take care of him. - Mm? You feelin' better? Mark! Mark! Mark! Mark! - What is it? - The kid's awake! Come on. (mellow orchestral music) - How do you feel? - I, where am I? - Well, what's your name? - I'm, I'm, I've forgotten. I don't know. - [Mark] I'll move here. - Take it easy, kid. - I can't remember anything. Where am I? - Just keep quiet. - Doctor. Now, what's he got? - Dementia. - No medical terms. - Happens very frequently, especially in cases of high temperature. - Lost his memory, that's good. What else? - Nothing else, but I'll get him well again, just as soon as Lapporte gets here with the medicine from Camp Keno. - Lost his memory? - We won't get our money back with any poster. I say we get it! - Captain Brandy? - Right. I'm sure he knows plenty. I say let's ask him a few questions. (men clamoring) - Tinker, that's enough of that. Stop stirring up trouble. As long as I'm sheriff, I'm keeping order in this place. - Yeah, why didn't you say that to those murdering bandits, huh? - Miss Cotton, don't forget, you're not the daughter of the sheriff from Camp Keno now. - Don't worry, I'm not stealing anything. This Colt belongs to my daddy, and I wish I could fire at the men who, in cold blood, killed my father. - I understand how you feel but they just disappeared without a trace, no wagon tracks, nothing. - [Rose] Then I'm gonna keep on looking. - It can be very dangerous, Rose. You mustn't do anything without asking me. - Since there are no men in Camp Keno to avenge his murder, then I have to do it alone. - Yes, Buck. I know, I know. We'll find Billy. We'll find him. We'll find him. (soft mellow music) - [Shat] Boo. - Thanks, Shat. It's alright. I understand you. You've been alone so long here. Forgot how to talk. See you. (Buck barking) Come on, Buck. (melancholic orchestral music) - [Rose] Halt. Hands up. Don't try anything. - Rose, it's Don, don't shoot. I'd give myself up without a fight. - [Rose] Don! - [Don] What are you doing out here, Rose? - They shot my father and the other men who were with him on the gold transport. The only one who got away was Buffins. - I'm sorry, Rose. Did they get the men who did it? - No. - I only count five graves. What about the kid? - There was no kid. I was there when they buried the men. - Rose, I gave your father a boy to take along with him. His name was Billy Sanders. It's either he escaped or still with the men who did this. Where's the deputy sheriff? - Buffins? He's now the sheriff of Camp Keno. - I wanna talk to him. If we find Billy Sanders, we'll find the men who killed your father. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, listen, I know everything again. I know my name. I know who my father is. We've got a mine in the mountains. - The boy, hey! - What's the new idea with that new get-up? What did you pay for it with? - Where's the nuggets, boss? I told them how we did just get rich. - You idiot, why now? It's too soon after the raid on the gold transport. They'll put two and two together and figure out our plan. - [Lapporte] They ain't that smart around here. And Buffins has agreed we are to get rid of the kid. - Buffins? Buffins hasn't anything to say. That's my business. - Did you bring the stuff? - [Lapporte] But I wanna tell you something. That kid's dangerous for us when he starts remembering. - [Mark] That aint likely to happen soon according to what the doctor said. He won't remember anything for quite a while. - [Lapporte] And another thing, that kid's got parents somewhere. They'll be looking for him. - [Mark] And by then, we'll be far away, Lapporte. - [Lapporte] I don't care, I believe in playing it safe. And the safest way is to get rid of him. - [Mark] Shut up, that kid might hear you. - Hey kid, how do you feel? I see we're wide awake. So, there's our little man. What's your name? What's your name? - Bill. - Why don't you wanna tell us, kid? - I don't remember, sir. My head is empty. Can't remember anything. - He's lost his memory, you idiot. I'll tell you who you are. You're Robbie. Robert Monty. - Robert Monty. - Believe me, men, I know what I'm talking about. Jason, you lost all your savings when the gold transport was held up, didn't you? - Sure, lost every cent. Why, can you get it back? - [Tinker] Possible. - You know where it is? - Yeah, it's in the safe in Captain Brandy's house. - Then let's go get them. - Wait a minute, take it easy. It's in Captain Brandy's safe alright but in the backroom on the first floor. We gotta get the key or break the safe open. Go get your hammer. - I'm sorry, Captain. - [Betty] What's the matter? - I'm skippin' out. - You're so afraid they've got you shaking in your pants just because of that troublemaker, Tinker. - Well, there's talk going on around that you had some connection with the transport attack. - That's a lot of stupid joke. - It's gonna get hot and I don't wanna get holes in my skin where they don't belong. - Whom will you rats? That sort of sinking ship? Pay them what we owe him, Betty and throw that coward off our boat. - Right! - Captain! I'll tell you a tornado is blowing and it's about to blast through here. - Oh! (gasps) Good afternoon, gentlemen. Is there anything special you'd like to drink? - We came for something else besides that rock out of yours. We came here to get our gold. - But this is a saloon, not a bank. - We'll settle accounts with you later, Betty. But first, we'll settle up with the captain. - Mutiny! I'll have you shrunk from a mat by a heat. - You're gonna hand over your share of that money. Where have you got it hidden? In a safe? - Listen, now, stop it! - [Tinker] Jason, the hammer. - [Betty] Oh! - [Brandy] Beat them with a law, son. Get this bastard 15 lashes. Idiots. Get down from the command breach, hold it! (punches thudding) (punches thudding) (grunting) (mellow music) - [Betty] Where's the sheriff? Hurry, they're gonna kill the captain. - Rose, go get him. Buck, stay there. (men grunting) (punches thudding) Hey, my name's Don. Who are you? (punches thudding) - There! (giggles) - [Don] Huh? - [Ham] My name's Ham. (grunts) (punches thudding) - [Don] Huh? Outta here. - There! - Give me the key to the safe, you damn drunk. - [Brandy] All hands on deck! All hands on deck! Puny villain! Hold me the keys! - Help! Help! The captain, come up stairs. Tinker's gonna kill him! - What? - Hold them! - He needs help. - [Brandy] Stop it! - [Don] Here, you guys (grunts). - [Brandy] Gracious, help me! Help me! (punch thuds) - Alright. (grunting) (Betty gasps) (grunting) (punches thudding) (grunting) (punches thudding) (grunting) (grunting) (punches thudding) (grunting) (gunshot bangs) - [Buffins] Hey, are you crazy? What's going on, Betty? - How should I know? Ask Tinker. He's the one who started this. - What happened, Tinker? - Nothing. We was just letting off a bit of steam. (scoffs) - It would've been a lot of steam. If Don Rutland hadn't come, it would've been much worse. - Oh, thank you very much mister-- - Rutland. - Oh, Rutland. - Don Rutland. - Our fellows are a little bit nervous over the attack on the gold transport. - I wanna talk to you about that. - You know anything about it? - Maybe. - Oh then, let's go talk in my office. - Don. Thanks a lot. (laughing) - Thank you! The fighter I had in years. (brooding music) - [Man] Alright. What are you doing? Now, what's the problem. Right, who doesn't like a good drink after a good fight? - [Man] There ain't no fighter in you. (laughing) - Secure the ship. Hand around the whiskey for the whole crew! (men celebrating) (laughing) - Captain, your face! I better get you some iodine. - Where are you going? We're having one hell of a party. (laughing) My kind of iodine. (laughing) - You mean you tell me you gave Cotton a kid by the name of Billy Sanders at Lonesome Corner. - That's right. - And what are you going to do now? - I'm gonna look for Billy Sanders. - I'm sorry to tell you, we didn't find even the slightest trace. - But I found that. Billy Sander's father gave me this bag of gold. It weighs about 10 ounces. I gave it to Sheriff Cotton. Cotton is dead. Now, one of the murderers lost it in the saloon. - And I'm supposed to believe you, Rutland? - You believe what you want. But I know at least one of the killers of Bear Path is here in Camp Keno. - But you, you're also here. - Billy Sander's father is dead. And this gold belongs to Billy. And I'm gonna find him. You see, I figured it. One of them lost this pouch. The pouch I gave your father. - [Rose] But who? - Who? I don't know yet. - [Rose] What's wrong? - Buffins. He's riding away. - [Rose] I wonder where he's heading. - Maybe he's delivering a message. - [Rose] Seems to be in a hurry. - Yeah. Message for whom? - Don, I'm afraid. - You needn't be afraid for me. I can take care of myself. It's the others who have to be afraid. Sit down. I haven't any proof Buffins is involved. At least not yet. But I do know that one of the murderers is here in Camp Keno. And I promise, I promise you, I'll find him. - It ain't a palace but it should do. See for yourself. It's the finest room in the whole hotel. Yeah, just take a look at that view. And a real bargain for the money. - [Don] Yeah. - There ain't no more comfortable bed in all Alaska. Fit for a king. Well. And you can't find fresher eggs for breakfast than right here in Camp Keno. Fine. The rooms is yours. But you have to pay $5 and what's more in advance. - Yeah. - Well, come on. (laughs) Thank you. I promise you, you'll sleep in here just like a newborn baby in a cradle. Alright, alright, I know that I'm not wanted. So long, buddy. See you gentlemen. (sniggers) - Well, Buck, what do you think? Home. (Buck whining) (hushes) Don't you make a. (Buck barking) Buck, Ham, I. - Is that the way you greet your friend? - I'm sorry, Ham, I wasn't expecting a friend. - I'm your friend. - I know. - I just came to tell who lost the bag of gold. - Who? - Buffins, I just saw him. - I thought so. - What about the bag? - Gold, rotten gold. - From the gold transport? - Yeah. - What can I do to help you? - Ham, we gonna keep an eye on Buffins. And make him a little nervous. - I'll make him nervous, alright. (gun clicks) (hoofbeats approaching) - [Lapporte] Hey Mark! - [Mark] Huh? - [Lapporte] Someone's coming. - [Mark] What? (Buffins yelling) What's the matter? You got in trouble? - There's a guy named Don Rutland in town. He's looking for a kid, Billy Sanders. - His name is Robert Monty. Who is this Don Rutland? - [Buffins] A fur trapper. But he could become a problem. By the way, Billy's, er, Robert's father is dead. - That's good. What about Rutland? - Kill him. - And real legal-like. Just like we do everything. Wait a minute. - [Buffins] Have you got anything to drink? - [Lapporte] Take it. - You gonna kill the people in Camp Keno that Rutland was the one who attacked the gold transport. Then you'll arrest him and put him into jail. Give him a chance to escape and then when he does, you could shoot him. You better practice your aim so you don't miss. - Okay. - Well, now we've had it. Just because of that damn kid. - Shut up. What you did is 10 times worse. Because of you, we've gotta play our bonanza game earlier than we wanted to. - The sheriff? - Yeah, the sheriff, Buffins. They won't believe Ham. He's just a black man. They won't believe in him. Well, now I know who my enemy is. And I am a hunter. We've got to find Billy. - [Rose] Yes. - Will you help me? - Yes, darling. You know I will. - [Buffins] Ho, ho! Well. What are you doing here? - I'm looking for you, sheriff. How could you leave lovely Camp Keno unguarded. - Ah, I was looking for the little kid. You know, Billy Sanders. Ain't that what you wanted? - [Don] And? - Nothing. Absolutely nothing. - Can I give you a little tip? - [Buffins] Go on. - I know for a fact that one of the murderers in Bear Creek is here at Camp Keno. But don't tell anyone. - I'm warning you. If you make a false accusation-- - No, no. I wouldn't accuse anyone without definite proof. But you could help me. You are the sheriff. You should investigate, cross-examine each everyone of these people until you have the murderer, you understand? You'll have them trapped. Oh, I'll be around again. - Hello, I was wondering if you could help me. Has anyone seen a young boy about 10 years old? His name is Billy Sanders. - [Man] No, I haven't seen any youngster around here. - You're good men, I'm gonna appoint you my deputies. Tinker. - [Tinker] Thank you. - [Buffins] My pleasure. - [Frank] We'll do our best for you, Buffins. - [Tinker] Yeah, I'll promise you that. - I think we're gonna have company. - Yeah, who? - Don Rutland. The guy's been snooping around and I don't like that. Oh, Mr. Rutland. What gives me the honor? - Billy Sanders, I was just curious. Did you find out anything? You know where he might be? - I don't know anything yet. But I'll know something soon. I and my deputies here are gonna search every house. And when I catch the murderer, better watch out. (gunshots bang) - [Mark] Bonanza! Go, bonanza, bonanza! - [Townsman] What's going on? What's the shout for? - [Mark] We found gold on our finders! Gold in our mines! - [Townsman] Really? When to strike? - [Mark] Right now, bonanza! Alright, everybody! Let's go and celebrate! In my mine, everybody's great. The whole town is invited, you hear me? The whole town. Alright, everybody, into the saloon. Come on. (men laughing) - Might as well go have a drink. It's free. - Oh no no, you don't, Tinker. No drinking while in you're duty. Go search the houses there. I'll check the hotel. - [Man] Let's go there! There's gold in there!. (excited townsmen talking over each other) - Hello! - Hello, captain. - Hello, Don. Glad to see you. Come on, have a drink. No, no, you have a drink for both of us. (men celebrating) - Hello there. Something like hella lumba. Another drink! Ai, a drink hey! A drink here! - Congratulations. - Thank you. Thank you. Have a drink for you. Come on, let's have a drink! - Congratulations. Gold, he found gold. - You look a little pale! (men laughing) - Listen, listen to me. - Yeah. - I never found gold. - Here have a drink. That's right. - Excuse me, mister. I never found gold. - Nevermind, me, I found it! I did! - I never did. But I wonder, I wonder. I was wondering, I lost a boy. - Yeah, you like it? - A boy, a boy. His name is, it's Billy Sanders. Did you happen to run across him? - Boy named Billy Sanders? - Yeah, about that high. - No. I never heard the name. I found gold! A bonanza, mister. Mister, ah? - Rutland, Rutland. - Mr. Rutland? I never heard about you. Doesn't matter. You're my friend. Come on, get my friend a drink. - [Buffins] Well what did you find? - Nothing. - [Tinker] Now, we searched every place in town. - Just gotta keep looking. Let's go. Frank Fox. - But that's the pouch that I gave to the gold transport. - We've got him. (townspeople laughing) - Hey yo. There's a whiskey bottle on the deck. - No. - Even in the woods. - No! - [Mark] Come on, honey. - Without holding on to anywhere. Even on this deck. What do you think, you land rat? - Another drink for everybody! (townspeople cheering) - Ahoy, later! Push sail! Now, full speed ahead! We're heading into the heart of sea! (townspeople vocalizing) (townspeople celebrating) (laughing) - Quiet! Quiet, everybody! We know who attacked the gold transport. I found this on a saddle back on horse stitched to a post not the 60 feet from here. My two deputies will testify to that. This bag of gold belong to Mr. Fox. It was on the gold transport. And the bag and the horse belong to that man standing right there! - [Man] Let me at him! Who is this guy? (men clamoring) - Get back, get back all of you! I'm in charge here! I tell you it was that man. They killed Cotton and stole the gold. - [Man] Let's string him up! - Don't try anything. If we string this fellow up right here and now, we might just as well say goodbye forever to our gold. (men clamoring) - Captain, oh captain! They've arrested Don Rutland. - [Captain] Ahoy. - Wake up! (men clamoring) - Hey step back, watch it, come on. (men clamoring) Come on, I'm the sheriff here. Let me through. Like I told you before, the murderer better watch out. (men clamoring) - Quiet! We captured the murderer! Now, we have another reason to celebrate! (men celebrating) - [Man] That's what I say! (men celebrating) (melancholic music) - Well boy, Buck. We can't do a thing. Not a thing. - [Rose] Whoa! Hello, Harry. - [Harry] What are you doing here, Rose? - Have you seen a little boy about 10 years old? - [Harry] I haven't seen a fellow long as I've been padding here. (suspenseful music) (spade clacks) - Have you seen the kid today, Doc? Robbie! (fast-paced music) Robbie! That damn little brat. Now, where's he gone to? (suspenseful music) (yells) (yelling) (yelling) (gunshot bangs) Little brat. What you think you're trying to do? I'll teach you to take off. - [Billy] Aw! Aw! - Go wash the blood off your hands and get back to the tent. - Who are you? Aren't you Billy Sanders? (brooding music) - No, I'm not. I'm, no miss, I'm, I'm Robbie! (fast-paced music) - Is Don Rutland home? - Don Rutland? Don Rutland's a thief and a murderer. Well, he's the man who attacked and held up the gold transport and killed your father. - No, that can't be true. - What's true enough? You can ask him yourself. He's over there in jail. - Don! Don, tell me the truth. Tell me, well, did you? - Get out! What? Get out of here! - [Rose] Tell me it isn't the truth! - [Buffins] Get out! - Come on! - Who's gonna do it? (melancholic music) - Don't be sad, miss. Don is innocent, I know it. Everything will be clear enough soon. - Thanks, Ham. (lively music) (townspeople celebrating) - I just wanna dance! - Leave me alone! I don't feel like dancing! - Why you? You don't wanna dance with me? - No, I don't! - He was your dream man, that Rutland. Now, it's quits with him. I like you, really. I'm gonna buy you again. I can buy everything. - No! No! (men murmuring) - Just you wait. I'll get you. Music! Come on, dance! Dance, everybody! (lively music) - We'll do everything we can to see that they give you a fair and square trial. Except first, you gonna have to tell us, where you hid all the gold. You should be ashamed to yourself though. Stealing money from respectable hardworking decent folks. Another thing. I don't plan to miss the celebration at the saloon on account of you. And you better not get any foolish notions about escaping while I'm gone. I'll give you another piece of advice. Don't be sitting too hard on that chair next to the wash down. The legs are very wobbly. (townspeople celebrating from a distance) (grunts) (townspeople laughing and celebrating) (grunts) (punch thuds) - Like you said, I should get on Buffins's nerves. - You sure did, thanks. (window tapping) (gasps) - [Rose] How did you? - Close the curtain. Rose, listen. Do I have to explain? - No, you don't have to. I'm just happy. - So am I. - But you got to go. - I know. I got to find Billy. - Yes, I saw a young boy but I couldn't get near to him. There was a high ledge on the river between us. I heard a shot and then I saw him. He was below me and he has blood on his hands. - Did you talk to him? - Yes. I asked him if he's Billy Sanders. But he said his said he's name was Robbie. But he said it in a strange manner and as if he was under pressure. - Rose, can you take me to him? Do you remember the place? - Yes, yes! - Good. Rose, did your father have a rifle? I need a rifle. - Yes, had one. But it's only got a few shells. - That's alright, a few is better than none. Now get dressed, go on. (door banging) - What do you want here? - Don't scream or I'll kill you. (Betty screams) You know what I like about woman? You! Right there! You, it's you! (Betty grunting) - Betty! (grunting) (yells) - No! No! No! (grunts) (Brandy groaning) - Over there! That's where I saw the boy! - [Don] We better go on foot. Buck, come on. - There, see the blood spots? They must be from that boy. - Buck here, here. Come on. Do it. Let's go. (Buck barking) (gasps) - Captain. - You're really, you're really a first class seaman, Betty. I'll make you fist mate. Ahoy. (groaning) (Betty sobbing) (somber music) - Murderer! Murderer! Murder! Mark Monty has killed the captain! He murdered him! - The sheriff. - Come on! - Come on, get the sheriff. - Alright, follow us. - [Frank] Come on, Doug. Come on, let's go ahead. - [Man] Here we go. - [Tinker] We're gonna find the sheriff. He's over here. (men clamoring) - Sheriff. Buffins, what's the matter? Where's Rutland? Don't let him go away, he let Rutland go free. - [Man] Let's get him. - [Frank] Hey, get him! Don't let him get away, come on! (horse neighing) (punch thuds) - [Man] Our gold! - [Frank] There it is! He had it all time! - I think I've gotten on his nerves again. (laughing) - [Don] Hold it. Come on. - [Mark] Pack everything, we're getting outta here. Get the horses. - You've finally come to your senses. We should've done this a long time ago. - [Mark] Shut up and start packing. - Hey, you're not leaving me here. Your gonna take me along with you, aren't you? You just can't leave me here. I wanna come along. (suspenseful music) - They're leaving. I have no idea what they're planning to do with Billy. Buck, Buck. Billy's in there. You gotta go get him. Go get Billy. Go on, go find him, go on. - [Doc] Don't leave me here alone! - Hurry up! - Take everything with you. - We haven't got much time. - What did I do? - [Mark] Lapporte. - [Doc] Please, please. - [Mark] We'll take Robbie's horse with us too. We can put the ammunition and provision on him. Hurry up! - [Doc] You can't just leave me here. - [Lapporte] You can die with the kid. - [Doc] Please. - [Mark] Robbie's coming along as a hostage. - [Doc] Listen to me. - [Lapporte] Which way we're headed? - [Mark] South, to the border. California. - Take me, Mark, please. Take me, please. You can't leave me here. - [Mark] Doc, stop your blubbering. - [Lapporte] I'll stop him for you. - [Mark] Let's go, come on. Come on, help me take down the tent. - I've gotta stop them. - [Doc] Please, you can't just leave me like this. - [Mark] Doc. - [Doc] Please, I don't wanna die. Please, Mark. - [Mark] Robbie, Robbie! - Billy! (gunshots bang) Rose, take Billy back to Camp Keno. Get going, go on! - [Lapporte] Out of the way, you quack! - [Doc] No! (gunshot bangs) (Lapporte grunts) (brooding music) (whistles) - Hey! (gunshot bangs) Hold it right there. Or the next one, I'll put between your eyes. (suspenseful music) Hold it, Mark. I could kill you but I won't. I'm gonna take you back so you can face a trial. (gunshots bang) (gunshot bangs) (gunshot bangs) (suspenseful music) (gunshot bangs) Mark, hey, hey! Might as well give up! I'm not gonna let you go! (gunshot bangs) (gun clicking) - [Mark] Hey! Here, I'll throw my gun away. Come on and get me. (explosion bangs) (grunts) (suspenseful music) - [Ham] Hold there. - [Betty] Rose, what are you doing here? - I've just come from the Monkey Mines. - Well, that's where we're headed for. - Man and his man were the ones who attacked and robbed the gold transport. - Don Rutland is innocent. - Buffins confessed. Now, we're gonna get the real murderers. (suspenseful music) (rocks thudding) (explosion bangs) (knife clanks) (grunts) (suspenseful music) (punch thuds) (grunts) (punch thuds) (grunts) (punches thudding) (grunting) - Give up, Mark. Give up, you haven't got a chance. - I give up. - Put your hands together. Keep them there. (grunting) (Mark yells) Hold on! (groaning) I'm coming! Hold on! (Mark screams) - [Ham] We've got the gold! - [Tinker] We've got the gold! (townspeople clamoring) - [Billy] He's trying to save me. They shot at me and killed Buck. - [Don] Rose. - Look, here's comes Don. - Don! - Billy? (mellow uplifting music) The men that killed your father, Rose, are dead now. - [Billy] Don! - [Don] Billy. - Rutland, we all ask you to forgive us. - I think it would be better if you ask him if he wants to be the new sheriff of Camp Keno. - [Man] Yeah, that's a good idea right there. - No, no. No. I promised Billy's father that I'll be his friend and take care of him. So if you want to, let's go back to the mountains, huh. - Yes, yes. (Don yelling at huskies) - [Don] Go Mariacha! (Don laughing) (Don yelling) (Don and Billy lauging) Go, go Mariacha! (Don yelling) (mellow uplifting music)
