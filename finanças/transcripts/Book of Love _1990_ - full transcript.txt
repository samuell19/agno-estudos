The Book of Love is a book that's written in the heart of every horny teenager. And, believe it not, it's based on a true story. Hey, Jack, it's Crutch. Your divorce papers just came through... and you're flying solo again. Um, the judge did give her the house in the country. But we had to expect something like that from a wife... who is also a lawyer. Anyway, speaking of divorces... guess who's back in town visiting her mother? A certain old flame of yours from high school. Does cute, dark hair, and a pistol ring a bell? And, Jack, she asked about you. See ya later, alligator. You big stud. Dark hair and a pistol? A pistol? I wonder, wonder, who, oh, who. Who wrote the book of love. Tell me, tell me... OK. An old flame from high school. Connie? Cute but no pistol. Bunny. And me. Who wrote the book of love... So, we got shot down, Captain Midnight. Life does play its tricks. But hey, you wanted to be successful, you are. You fought for the girl... you got her. You expected a wonderful marriage... it was terrible. Don't you wonder if life could've been different? Come on back, Jack. Remember who you really are. I know some things you've forgotten. Some very important things. Baby, baby, baby, I love you, yes, I do... I got to meet the plumber in 20 minutes. Let's go! Be very careful. You guys want to ride with me? Yeah, yeah. Can we, Mom? Well, OK. We don't have much room anyway. Jack, please be careful with the china, Chapter two, you tell her. You never, never, never, nev-never gonna part. In chapter three, remember. The meaning of romance. In chapter four you break up. But you give her just one mere chance. See that? That's smoke from the slag pile. Used to walk up there, you'd be dead in no time. Goal gas. Wow, a mountain on fire, What a great neighbourhood, huh, Jack? You know what happens to you in a new neighbourhood? What? You get your ass kicked. I a-love you, darlin' Baby, you know I do. But I've got to see this book of love. Find out why it's true I wonder, wonder, whom, ba-doo-000, who. Who wrote the book of love? Chapter one says to love her. You love her with all your heart. Chapter two you tell her. You never, never, never, ne-never gonna part. In chapter three, remember. The meaning of romance. In chapter four you break up. But you give her just one mere chance. Hey, Mom, did you see the blazing mountain? You die in minute if you went near it. Oh, we'll never smell that up here. I wonder, wonder, who, ba-doo-000, who. Who wrote the book of love? Hey, oh, be very careful with that. It contains a very valuable comic book collection... including White Rider. In reality, of course, I am White Rider. Well, ride this. Ugh. I wonder, wonder, who ba-doo-000, who. Who wrote the book of love? I wonder who. Yeah! Who wrote the book of love? You're the Twillers, right? Yeah. I live down the block. My name's Paul Kane. Hi. But everyone just calls me Crutch. You know, Crutch, Kane, Get it? - What happened to your leg? - I got hit by a beer truck. I'm going to get hit by a beer truck when I grow up. Yeah, it's a pretty good deal. You don't have to take out the garbage. You get excused from gym class. Peanut! - The chicks love it. - Coming! Come on, I'll show you around the neighbourhood. All right, I'm glad you came along. You know, I thought a new neighbourhood might be trouble. What do you mean? Well, you know, I thought since I was the new kid... and everything, somebody might think they had to kick my ass. Oh, never happen. Not with me as your pal, at least. I pull a lot of weight around hers. Uh, Crutch, who's that? It's Angelo Gabooch and his gang. Um, just act natural and ['ll handle everything. OK. I thought you said you carried a lot of weight around this neighbourhood. OK, so we got depantsed. Worse things could've happened. Come on, my house is just right around the corner. - Ahh! - Ha ha ha. Holy shit! Hi, Crutch, love your outfit. Ha ha ha. Oh, my God. A blue colossus with red cape. He's strong, he's brave, he's... He's going to sit down and eat his breakfast. Boys, I hope you're going to try and mingle... with the other students today. Your first day at a new school is very important. All right, Mom. Mingle. Ahem. Mingle, Peanut. Just be prepared to knuckle down, young man. Jack, I know it's not going to be easy... entering a new schaol in the middle of your sophomore year. He's afraid they're gonna beat the crap out of him. Peanut, such language. Don't talk to your mother like that. Take off that cape and get dressed properly. I'm taking you to school. I'm fighting for the cause of justice. How will it look if my mother takes me to school? Up in the morning and off to school. That teacher is teaching the golden rule American history and practical math. This is where Spider Bomboni lives. His old man's in jail. Hello, Spider! Yeah, yeah. I'm coming. Spider's a real jerk-off artist. 17 times in one day. Oh, that's a lot of pounding. It's true. But he's got inspiration. Oh, I wish I had a sister. Crutch, hey. Don't skip a-school today. Yeah, yeah. Right. Keep your shirt on. Mrs Bomboni, I'd like you to meet a new kid in the neighbourhood. Ah, you're all fucking bums. Ma, can I have a quarter? I'll give you a quarter. Spider, meet Jack Twiller. He just moved into the neighbourhood. Hey, if you lay a buck on me and uh... you come around tonight and you can watch my sister take a bath. He's got a hole drilled in the bathroom wall. The perfect view. Worth a buck. Every Friday night. Right, spider? - Right. - Sounds good to me. So you got any new hot books, Spider? Oh, yeah. Check this out, huh? I just got these in yesterday. Look at this. Candy and Derwood Go Camping. Sounds educational. Hey, you learn something new with me everyday, jerk off. It'll cost you two bucks. No problem. That's what lunch money's for. Look at this one. This one's my favourite right here. “For not by any calm and indolent spoutings... “net by the peaceable gush... “of that mystic fountain in his head... "did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity..." "but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching." "Rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths..." “the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk... "" into the pure element of air... “and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam... "shows his place to the distance of 7 miles and more." "In these moments..." “the torn, enraged waves he shakes off, seem his mane. “In some cases this breaching is his act of defiance. "There she breaches, There she breaches', was the cry..." "as in his immeasurable bravadess..." "the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to Heaven." All right, class, for tomorrow, chapter seven, please. Hearts made of stone... Hey, Spider. Will never break. For the love you have for them... That's Gina Gabooch. She's cute but don't go near her. She's Angelo's sister. And all of your love. Is there to take. Remember Lily's friend Wanda? Bazungas really make a statement, don't they? Actually, Wanda and I have a little something going there. Hey, Wanda, I can finally introduce you to Jack Twiller. Get lost, creep. Please, please, please, break. And all of your love. Here comes Lily. Smart, rich, and the princess of my wet dreams. Hey, let's try to make an impression. Did you see that? She couldn't take her eyes off of me. I got to go to class. I'll see ya later. No, no, no, no, no, no, everybody knows I told you you should have spent your time looking for gold... instead of those worthless old relics no one would want. Oh, fine relic hunter I am, Tim, Yeah. I just missed a chance to get a silver bullet... from the Lone Ranger. Hi-Ho, Silver! Away! Get washed up, boys. And now a word from our sponsor. You better get Wildroot Cream or, Charlie, Start using it today. You'll find that you will have a tough time, Charlie. Keeping all the gals away. It isn't any news who Lily will choose. The Wildroot guy. Come on, Twiller, give it a try. Go get some right away Jack, you OK? I'm fine. The Lone Ranger. A copyright... I met a girl today. Her name is Anita Krump. Her braids stick out. She wears white socks with little flowers around them. 1 love her little socks. Well, she says if I gave her a ring, 1 could go out with her. So, help me pick out one. Let's see, maybe the, uh... zombie skull ring er... Ah, my Straight Arrow Golden Nugget Picture Ring. Did you meet any girls today? - Yeah. - Did they want a ring? No. Well, if they do, you can have one of mine. Boys, dinner! You're a good man, Peanut. Oh, we're the men of Texaco. We work from Maine to Mexico. There's nothing like this Texaco of ours. Our show tonight is powerful. We'll wow you with an hourful. Of howls from a showerful of stars... Jack, are you meeting any girls? There are kids in my class, Ma... and, yes, some of them are girls. Oh. Ha, Did you know that I once won a ballroom dance contest? Quiet, please. I am trying to watch this. Dancing is a very important part of dating. The boys who can dance... have their pick of the girls. And since I know that you would never do this on your own... Crutch's mother and I have enrolled you both in dance class. Mom, I do not want to take dance lessons. Oh, don't be silly, dear. You will love them. Shh! Ma, I'm aclod. I can't... I can't do that. Jack, you're going to love dancing. Won't he, Joe? Mmm. Clod. Absolutely. Mm. Shh, and this is a wonderful programme. It isn't just ballroom dancing but tap dancing as well. Oh, that's different. Tap dancing?! Let me see those taps. Let me hear them. Very good, boys and girls. All right, and a turn. Right. Watch your arms. Make me believe. Let's keep smiling. Everyone, keep smiling. All right. Shuffle, two, three. Keep smiling. What is she doing here? All right and up these stairs. Hokey pokey and up the stairs. Very good. Good. Very, very good, Lily. All right, now. Beginners in the next room, please. Boy, am I glad that's over. Yeah, no kidding. - How's your knee? - It's killing me. But dancing's my life. I'm dedicated. You know what I mean? Jack. You know what, Crutch, I... I've been thinking about the, um... the stair routine and, uh... there's definitely something that just doesn't work about it. Wait. Jack! - Aah! - Jack! Uh! Ah! Are you all right? Um, yeah. Uh... Uh, a special roll-you do it right, you don't get hurt. Look, you've a huge lump on your head. Um, i-it's part of the routine. Well, I hope you're OK. - Yeah, I'm fine. - OK. - Thank you. - Bye. Think Lily was impressed? Oh, definitely. I mean, the way you took all these steps on your head. Hey, she had to be impressed. Ah, I think I broke a rib. I think she's going to remember that number for a long time to come. Guy rolls down 26 stairs, comes up dancing. Hey, tell me about it. It's Angelo. Gina, Gather. Round me, buddies. Hold your glasses high. And drink to a fool. 'Cause I'm that fool... My problem is I'm just not cool. I gave Anita Krump a ring with her name on it. Yeah, where did you get that? I sent away. It took six Crispy box tops. Ahh. Her name glows in the dark. Ahh. Now, I have to meet her at the movies every Saturday. She wears a training bra, What, is she going to do tricks with her tits? Is that something girls have to train for? I suppose you went through this when you were my age, huh, Jack? No. You bring something all your own to it, Peanut. OK! Time for bed, boys! - Come on! - Aah! My tent won't stay up, Jack. A good stiff pole is the answer to your tent, Lily. Open your flaps, and I'll take a look. Oh, Jack, you've really got me pegged. So, what are we gonna do do for spring vacation? Oh, you know what? I think Lily and Wanda... are going to be camping up at Blue Lake. Oh, this is it. You hang around, you tap dance... and then finally you get a big break. Long walks, private picnics, just us and them at Blue Lake. What an opportunity! Crutch's mother and I have already discussed it. You're going to Ranger Camp together. Mom. Ma, you cannot do this to me. Crutch and I already made special plans. You are going to Ranger Camp. You know, Jack, I don't like to say this... but you are too much involved... with your small clique of friends. Just moping around the neighbourhood. Now, at Ranger Camp... you'll learn to mix with new boys from all walks of life. Mom, I haven't been to a Ranger meeting all year. I know and it's been a great disappointment to me. The uniform is so becoming on you. The Ranger's creed we can't forget, hurrah, hurrah. We're lighting the signal lamp again, hurrah, hurrah. The compass points the way to go. We'll sleep beside the fire's glow and we'll all be there when the Rangers go marching home. You know, boys, as we come to the close of the first day of Ranger jamboree... I would like to remind you of the Ranger credo. Serve your friends, surmount your foe, and do your duty. Good night, men. It's not so bad after all. Yeah, yeah. I guess it's OK. I mean, it seems like a pretty good bunch of guys. You know, that's it. Later for the girls. We're in it together, till the end. Bonds of new friendship. Camaraderie. - Ha ha ha ha. - Hey, I wonder who's in our tent? Ha ha ha ha. Hey, join the party, dorks. It's Sehank's birthday, so we decided to give him a candle. Ha ha ha. Happy birthday, Schank. Guys. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Schank. Happy birthday to you. Ha ha ha ha. - Make a wish, Schank. - Uhh! Um, guys the mosquitoes are going to eat him alive. I'm gonna undo him, OK? Don't touch these chains. I was just joking, Angelo. I mean, sitting around by candlelight, that's what scouting's all about. Yeah, tomorrow we got a big pink candle for you two. We'll light 'em up real nice. Right? Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha. All right, men, extinguish that candle. - Ow. - Shit, Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Yeow! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Sweet dreams, Twiller. Ha ha ha. Shh, What about Schank? You're right. We can't leave him here. They'll hear us try to take his chains off. They'll beat the crap out of us. Then we'll take him, chains and all, Shh, Turn left, turn left, Uhh. Look out. Watch your step. Ow! You OK? No. - Uhh! - It's-It's no good. I can't see where I'm going, Cruteh. We need a light. Sorry, Schank. - Mmm. - We got to do it. Come on, guys. Aren't we safe yet? Ahh. You broke your father's heart... by leaving Ranger camp after only one day. Yeah, but, Mom, that one day was so perfect... nothing else could hold a candle to it. Oh, Jack, you've got to start thinking... of your future, of expanding your boundaries. Have you given any more thought to becoming a teacher? I've thinking about becoming a writer. Oh, Jack, everybody knows writers starve. I think it's very nice that Floyd asked you over... while we go out to play canasta. I understand he's quite a gentleman. Ohh. I hope some of that rubs off on you. Hello, hello. - Hi, how are you? - Fine. Come on in. - Oh, what a lovely home. - Welcome, Jack. Hi. Floyd, I want you to meet Jack's mother. Very nice to meet you, ma'am. It's very nice to meet you too. My. Oh, what a lovely living room. Your father's going to Rotary, Floyd, and we'll be home around 11:00. You may have a get-together of friends. Thank you, Mother. You boys enjoy yourselves. Have a good time, sweetheart. Mother thinks you'll be a good influence on me. Earth angel, earth angel. Would you Will you be mine? My darling dear. Whoa, whoa I love you for all time I'm just a fool I'm just a foaoool. A fool in love with you. Yooooouuu. Ooh, ooh, ooh. Whoo, that was fucking great! That was great! Music. And now, and now... What? For something a little special. Oh, you can't sing. - Yeah, right. - My famous créme de menthe. Ohh. Rock-n-rye. Peppermint Schnapps. Peach flaveured brandy. Some of that, whatever it is... high ball... a garnish of raisin, perhaps. For you, Twiller, this is for you. My friend, Jack Twiller. - That's your drink. - It's good. Ugh. Mmm. Yeah, that's, um, smooth, - Good. - Hey, hey. Very, uh, smooth. Hey, make some calls, huh? We want some pussy. - Yeah. - Go to "I." That's a good idea. I. There's nothing but sluts in here. Yeah, - That's what we want. Sluts. Uh-huh, OK, well, just tell her... Tell her Jack Kerouac called. That's right. Well, thank you, Mrs Zimmerman. By the way, what are you doing right now? Oh, OK. All right. By, Smooth. Very smooth. So? So, I made 23 calls. - And? - And nobody's coming. Damn it, I never get any breaks. Looks like one more party with the boys. Oh, shit, it's going to turn into another dick measuring contest. Hey, guys. - The back door was open. - Schanky! Hey, Schank, you see any chicks on the way? I just saw Lily and Wanda. 1 told them te pop by. Lily and Wanda? Lily and Wanda! They're back from Blue Lake. Do you realise what this means? Crutch! I've never been drunk before. It's... Gettin' high, gettin' high. Gottin' high, gettin' high. Gettin' high, gettin' high I'm just a fool... 6 and 2/16ths, Um... Schank is the winner. Give me that fucking thing. You missed a half-inch of root. - You would have lost anyway. Look. - Bullshit. Guys, it's not the size of the ship. It's the motion of the ocean. Shh, A toast... to the gang that will never die. Huh. Here's to the future. To the future! I'm just a fool. A fool in love. So, we got older and the hormones got bolder. We noticed other girls. We knew they were there, but, uh... it always came back to Lily, Lily, Lily. Uhh, - Uhh, Ahem. Ahh. I wish Lily could see me like this. Forget it. She and Angelo are going steady. How can she go steady with a prick like Angelo? The worse prick you are, the more chicks seem to like it. The thing you get to do is practise on your sneer. Like this. Higher. You look like you got your nuts caught in a meat grinder. Yeah, but the basic attitude is there. You know? You guys hear that Angelo's got colleges scouting him already? I mean, he's probably going to go on and play pro football or something. Yeah, I got my career choices narrowed down... to either dentist, chiropodist or a certified public accountant. Hey, you'd be a certified public asshole. Give me the work light over here. - Uhh! - Hey, Spider, what do you figure on being? Hey, I'm going to marry some rich old lady who's soft in the head. Hold the light right there. Oh, right. You've got a plan. That's what I'm always saying. You know, like for the senior prom. It's only 66 days away... and already I'm working overtime to get a date for it. Ah, fuck the prom. Only squares wear tuxedos. Crutch, the light. Ugh, that's just about got it. Uhh! You got to know how to find a bargain like this and fix it up. You know Snake's junkyard has a'63 Chevy convertible... for sale for 60 bucks? - Yeah, what's wrong with it? - Well, it needs a little work, It's underwater. Oh, great. Just right for you, Twiller. Heh heh. Ahh. I wish to hell I was mechanically inclined. Yeah? Well, you can start by getting me the vice grips on the workbench there. Hey, big guy, wanna change my oil?

Jeez. That was great. That was... You took complete control of the situation. Whoa, Wait a second. I just pointed a gun at Angelo's sister. He... he's net going to know... that this... this is... This is a cap gun, Floyd. He's going to pound my head into pepperoni. To hell with him. OK. To hell with him. - To hell with him. - To hell with him. I love you so and I want you to know - I need your love so badly. - Ha ha ha! Wop! Doo, doo, doo. Doo-doo-whoa! Doo, doo, doo. Doo-doo-wop, doo-doo-whoa doo-doo-wop. Uhh! Smooth. Very smooth.

It was a surprise to me too, Mom. And the couch? Jack, something very odd went on in this house... while we were gone. All of my jewellery and underclothes... have been rearranged. Could've been panty raid, Mom. My panties are not in the habit of being raided. You are trash and your friends are trash. And, Jack... if you do not get into some college... I don't even care which one any more... You are not my son. Oh, Then whose son am 12. Ahh. Mr Smart Alecs. Twiller, I've read your career folio. It doesn't seem realistic. Sir? Your career folio isn't grounded in reality. Now, these folios of your fellow classmates are realistic. They're based on what I like to call the facts of life. The facts of life, my boy. The facts of life. Now, what would you say to a job in the button mill? Uh, well, my... you know, my parents want me to go to college, sir. With your grades, they'll have to build you one... unless, of course, you have any other ideas. Um, well, I like to write. You know, uh... I got a vivid imagination. Uh, Twiller, you're what I like to call a daydreamer. In my experience, daydreamers don't go anywhere. Yeah? Well, I can't believe that, sir. Twiller, I couldn't even get you into bird grooming school. Bird grooming school? - Yeah, - Probably canaries, stuff like that? You ask anybody yet? You think I put off something that important? - My own senior prom? - And? 26 definite turn-downs. You know, I think Lily's really starting to like me. - I'm going to ask her. - Too late. She's going with Angelo. Are you sure? That's what Wanda told me. No, a... are you absolutely sure? Yeah. I'm sorry. Hey, let's go by the fairgrounds on Saturday.
