- My parents are still up. - Okay. - Come in and say hi. - No, I can't in this outfit! - Hi. - Hi. - Well, I'll be darned. - This is Carsten. Hi, Carsten. I'm Birgitte. It's nice meeting you. So this is what you look like. Come on, get a hug. - Hi and welcome - Thanks. I'm Carsten. - It looks like you've had a good time. - Yeah, so much fun. - We've had visitors. They just left. - Nice. Very nice. Are you two drunk? Dad! We just wanted to say hi. We'll be upstairs. Wait. Take some beers too. Come here. - There you go. - Thanks. - What are you dressed up as? - Erh, I?m Aladdin. Just Aladdin. I see. What about Melissa? She's Hitler. It was a theme party. Okay. What was the theme? Historical people. I guess I misunderstood. - Thanks for the beer. - Wait, have some more. I think Aladdin and Hitler should have a drink. There you go. It's Friday after all. - Thanks Melissa?s dad. - Melissa's dad is called Stig. I?m sorry, but we're going to bed, and this is too loud. - Dad. - I'm sorry, it can't be this loud. - Okay? Sleep well. - Go! I'm sorry my parents are so embarrassing! I think they're nice. And the worst part is that their bedroom is right in there, you can hear everything! What, they snore? - Well, that too. But... You know... - No! - When they. Ah! Ah! - No! They don?t! They do, Carsten! My dad is WAY gross when he groans. It's like: Oh! Birgitte! Oh! No! That?s too gross! Parents fucking, that?s the most disgusting thing ever! - No, you are. - I am? "Oh! Birgitte!" - "Oh! Birgitte! You're so lovely." - "Ah! Stig!" "Oh! I'm cumming! Are you?" - Carsten. Have some water. - Thanks. See if you can get some down. Let me take the glass. - Will you be okay? - Yeah. It's okay. - Hi Carsten. Good morning - Good morning. Do you want some breakfast? No thanks, I was on my way home. Have you seen Melissa? Yes, she and Birgitte are out playing racquetball. They?ll be back in an hour. She didn?t tell you? No. - Well, I'm going home so... - Excuse me, are you only wearing that? Don't you want to borrow a sweater? - Yeah, I do actually. - Yeah? Let's see. - Okay, you just take that. - Thank you. - So. - So. - I'll return it in a few days then. - No, never mind that. I never wear it. Birgitte bought it for me sometime. - Okay. - Yeah. Why are there two ducks here? Because I shot them. - So you, like, go hunting? - Yeah. I'm not a professional, it's just a hobby. Amazing. Everybody should try that sometime. It's not just about shooting, it's about being out in nature. Sitting by a lake in the forest in the early morning, drinking tea and Underberg. Then at some point the ducks fly by. And then you shoot, that's why you're there. I think my parents really like you. They asked us to go with them to the summer house this weekend. - Okay. What did you say? - No of course. Then we'll have the house to ourselves. If you want to come over mean. Of course I will. I mean, we could go with them, to the summer house if you want. No, it'll be fucking freezing now. Maybe it'll be nice to go away then. Just the two of us. Wouldn't it be nice to go away... ...somewhere, where we're not bothered all the time. I mean, it's just that I know that if we stay at home. I'll probably have to help with something at home all the time. So maybe it would be nice to get away a little then. Just the two of us. Okay then. - You mean that? - Yes. Okay then. If that's what you want. Perfect, just put it here. Thank you. Hey, Carsten. We'll stay here. Yes, that's your house. Awesome. - Can you handle it? - Of course. - Hi. - Hi. Can I help out somehow? Yeah actually, you can put some firewood in the basket. Sure of course. - Its a nice summer house you've got. - It is, isn't it? You can be damn sure I like it. It's nice that you two went along. Yes. How long have you and Melissa known each other? We've known each other for some time. But we've been together for almost a month. A month? Shouldn't you celebrate that? - One month anniversary? - Yeah. Yeah, we will actually. Don't tell Melissa. It's kind of a secret. But I bought two tickets for this concert, with this band we really like. So we'll go see them. - And she doesnt know? - No. But we'll kind of celebrate. - She'll like that. - Yeah. - Have you ever tried chopping wood? - No! You have to learn. Come here. It's important for a man having chopped wood once in his life. Come. It's really useful if you want to impress your girlfriend. Take it. It's heavy, but you need the weight to hit right here. Like that. Just let it drop, no need to use your strength. - Give it a go. - Okay. Again. Or you could turn it. - That's it! - That's it! - Yes. - That's it, and almost on your first go. - Well done. - Yeah, I was okay. Then there's this whole pile you can start on. So, anybody want to go hunting with me tomorrow? Birgitte? - No. - Oh. - How about you, Melissa? - No, I don't think so. What do you say, Carsten? Do you want to shoot ducks? - Seriously dad, he doesn't want to. - No. No thanks. - That wasn't a big seller, huh? - Nope. - Then I'll have to go alone. - Again. - Again. Poor me. - Poor you. - It's great you decided to come after all. - Yeah. Of course. It sounds like great fun. I've always wanted to try duck hunting. - Really? - Yeah. Well, it is pleasant. But don't expect a warm welcome home, if we do shoot any ducks. - They hate it. Especially Melissa. - I'd imagine. She's called me all sorts of things "Dad, you murderer!" It's true. But she'll eat it anyway on Christmas Eve. So, there'll be a lot of ducks there today? Yes, it's peak season. There'll be lots. They are out there, waiting. - To get shot. - Right, to get shot. But you should know it can be a while, sometimes you wait 2-3 hours. You never know. That's what's amazing. - It just takes patience. - Thats okay. - I've got plenty of patience. - That's good. That's what matters. It's just beyond those trees. In a minute you can see the lake. Then well. Oh no. My duck call, did I leave that at home? If I'm lucky it's in here. Hm, I wasn't. Then what. There it is! - What does that do? - This. - Good, huh? - Yeah, it's fun. Do it again. When the ducks hear that, they fly up. It's indispensable. I'm sorry. I dont think there are any ducks here today. - No. - I can tell. - We'll go home, okay? - Yes. - Hi. - Hi honey. Hi Carsten. - So you went along anyway? - Yeah. - That was a short trip, huh? - Yeah, well. No ducks. - Too bad. - Yes. Can you put on some water if you want eat? - You like my dad, right? - Sure. He's nice. I can tell you think that. What are you talking about? At the summer house. It just seems like you two hit it off. We didn't hit it off. You and I hit it off. I know. I'm just saying that I'm glad you like my dad. Stop talking about stuff like that. Is it bad that I say you like my dad and that I'm glad you have that man to man... Man to man?! You wanted to go to that summer house and what was the point? That you and I could be together, not that I'd be man to man with your dad, which I wasn't! I'm sorry. Sorry honey. - Stupid. - Sweetie. - That was a good meal. - Lovely. - Really tasty. - That's good. - You can help drying the dishes. - Sure of course. - It was delicious honey. - Good. I thought I'd just apologize for that thing that happened last ime. Well, that's okay. Fine. Calm down already! Your'e done helping out. My gosh, you scared me! What's up? Want to hang out later? I'm going to that racquetball tournament with my mom. I won't be home until late. Sorry. What about tomorrow then? I've got plans with Amalie. We'll never get together. - We'll never get together. - You really miss me that much? I have to go now. I'll call you later, okay? Sure, that's how it is. Hi. There's no doubt about it. And he knows. Mads, I have to go. Okay. Bye. - Hi Carsten. - Hi Stig. Is Melissa home? No, she isn't. She's playing racquetball with Birgitte. I think it'll be late when they get home. - I just got home myself. - Oh. Okay. I brought that sweater I borrowed. - Okay. Thank you. - You're welcome. - I hope you've worn it. - Yeah, all the ime. - I'll tell Melissa you stopped by. - No, that's okay. No need for that. - Well, bye. - Bye. Hey, Carsten? Do you want to come in? - There you go. - Thank you. Well. How's school? Oh, it's okay, had to skip biology today. I forgot to do this report that was due. It was better to pretend I was sick then I'll hand it in next time. Okay. Actually it's Melissa's fault. We've spent so much time together lately, she told me no to do the report. - So, it was Melissa's fault? - Yeah, actually it was. - She's so fond of you. - Yes, it's lovely. She talks about you all the time. Like it's the real thing. It's wonderful to see. Skipping classes was never my thing. I don't think I ever did. I'm sorry. I don't know what's wrong with me. I know how you feel. I don't understand. I don't understand. I do. Believe me, I understand. - Hi. - Hi. - It got cancelled! - Why? Not cancelled, too many signed up. - How annoying. - Yeah. - Hey Carsten. - Hi. - How nice. - Yeah. He just stopped by. - What are you doing here? - I was just... He was returning my sweater, the one you got me, the one I like so much. I was in the neighborhood so... I've been telling him to give it back. - You got to see me after all. - Lucky me. Do you want to stay for dinner? - Sure. I'd like that. - Wonderful. - I'd like that. - That's nice. Annoying it got cancelled. - Are you coming up? - Yeah. Why are you so cross? Huh? Mr. Cross. Don't. What's up? Is something wrong? There's something I have to tell you. Okay? What? I've met someone who I... I've met someone, who I've been with. It's got nothing to do with you, at all. It's just... Who is she? Huh? It's not a she. It's a guy. Maybe it's just a phase. I don't know. I think you should leave. Melissa, I'm so sorry. Don't touch me. Don't touch me! Get out! Get out! I'm leaving now. Okay, yes. See you. Stig, can I talk to you for a second? Yes, of course. Yes? Well... I just wanted to tell you that Melissa and I aren't together anymore. What? Erh, okay. I'm really sorry to hear that. And also I thought I'd ask... I still got these tickets for the concert. No. Carsten, listen to me. I can't. I'm glad you're asking, but I can't. I just thought I'd ask. I'm glad you asked. But it won't do. - We could just go for a walk? - No, no. I have to tell you I can't see you again. We can't see each other again. It... it has to be that way I hope you understand. - I understand. - Good. - Stig? - Yes. I'm going back to watch the movie, okay? - Sure. I'm going home anyway. - Okay. Coming! Ride safely then. I don't have a bike. Oh. Then walk safely, okay? Sure. - I will. - Good. I just want to say that I'm so happy got to know you. Me too. - Take care. - Bye. You have to go now. Bye. Stig, are you coming? Yes. I'll be right here. (Subtitles: Lalandian) (No copyright infringement is intended)
