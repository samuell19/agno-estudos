MUSIC BRASS HORN Around the world, another morning. Not so very different from the morning before or tomorrow morning. TICKING BRASS HORN This day on which man will leave Earth to walk on the Moon. Three billion people went about their daily lives. Some in the way in their ancestors did centuries before. Others in a world shaped by modern technology. It seemed that most people were unaware that this event might change the history of the human race, that this morning would be marked in history books and learned by their children's children. At what age of man will the meaning of this morning be understood? TICKING This is Apollo Saturn and launch control. We passed the six minute mark on our countdown for Apollo 11. The flight to land the first men on the Moon. We are on time at the present time for our plan lift off on thirty two minutes past the hour. Coming up shortly that swing arm up at the space craft level will back to its fully retracted position which should occur at the five minute mark in the count. The swing arm now coming back as our countdown continues... informing the astronauts that the swing arm now coming back. Four minutes and counting. We are go for Apollo 11. We will be coming up on the automatic sequence about ten or fifteen seconds from this time. The vehicle starting to pressurize as far as the propellant tanks are concerned and all is still go as we monitor our status for it. Firing command coming in now.

When Apollo was safely under way, control of the mission was switched to Houston. The months of tightly focused work at the Cape were over. It could honestly be said that this was the culmination of the dreams and fantasies of men and women over twenty five centuries of recorded time. APPLAUSE NAMES FROM HISTORY LISTED APPLAUSE And Robert Goddard, the American rocket pioneer. Yanky inventor, dreamer, they called him the Moon man and laughed. But on his own, he went ahead designing, inventing, and testing. His first proving grounds were on his Aunt Ethyl's farm in Alborne, Massachusetts. The neighbours complained. With a grant from Daniel Guggenheim, he moved to New Mexico with his wife Esther who was also his camera woman. Goddard had invented and launched the world's first liquid propellant rocket in 1926 and in the end he accumulated more than two hundred patents for everything from multistage rockets to fuel pumps and clustered engines. MUSIC By the year 1930, his rockets achieved a speed of five hundred miles per hour and an altitude of two thousand feet. This was the year in which the three Apollo astronauts were born. Goddard had a vision of the age of space, but the world was too slow to make it happen before his death. Thank you Robert Goddard for your inventiveness and perseverance. For most people, a trip to planets was easy. All you needed was a ten cent movie ticket and a nickel bag of popcorn. MUSIC Retard your speed to one half. ENGINE ROARING EXPLOSION What was that? I don't know. ENGINE ROARING One of killer king's ship coming up fast behind us. ENGINE ROARING EXPLOSION EXPLOSIONS ENGINE ROARING MUSIC ENGINE ROARING ENGINE ROARING MUSIC Come men. Thanks for saving us. Stand back! You're prisoners! Prisoners? ENGINES ROARING Uh-oh. Here they come. You better put in reverse Doc. Oh Flash!! What science fiction in the childhood of the space age could've guessed the shape of reality? The Saturn five rocket. Three stages, twenty eight stories tall, with eleven engines as powerful as all the waterfalls in North America combined. Years in the planning, months in the building and testing, the Saturn first stage lived but two minutes, forty one seconds. Staging and ignition. Eleven Houston, thrust is go. All engines are looking good. I Roger you loud and clear Houston. Two minutes, forty one seconds. Time to throw Apollo forty miles up into the sky and then an empty shell to fall back into the sea. MUSIC We got skirt sep. Roger we confirm skirt sep. Tower is gone. Roger tower. Neil Armstrong confirming both the engine skirt separation and the launch escape tower separation. Hey Houston, Apollo 11 and Saturn gave us a magnificent ride. Ah roger 11 we'll pass that on and it certainly looks like you're well on your way now. 11 Houston, your guidance is converged, you're looking good. Down range one hundred forty miles. Altitude sixty two miles. Velocity... - Mission control in Houston, Texas had taken over from launch control at Cape Kennedy for the duration of the eight day mission. The complicated technology of Apollo Saturn evolved from an ingeniously simple concept. Lunar, Orbit, Rendezvous. This requires a rocket made in many pieces that discards the useless weight of each piece when its function is completed. The flight began with a vertical lift through the heavy lower atmosphere and a tilt to the east at six thousand miles per hour the empty first stage is discarded to save weight. So is an adapter ring in the unused escape tower. With the second stage firing, it reaches fifteen thousand miles per hour when it too is jettisoned. The third stage places Apollo in Earth orbit at seventeen thousand four hundred miles per hour. When the space craft has been thoroughly checked out by the crew, the third stage fires again. Its speed now tearing at free from the grip of Earth's gravity. BEEPING While coasting outward the command service module separates and docks for access to the lunar module. And the empty third stage is left behind. BEEPING Apollo losses speed throughout nine tenths of its journey until the Moon's gravity overcomes the pull of Earth. Apollo fires in reverse direction. Slowing down enough to be captured in orbit about the Moon. Armstrong and Aldrin entered the Lunar module Eagle which separates leaving Collins in the command service module in Lunar orbit. BEEPING Eagle slows still more and breaks to a touch down on the lunar surface. BEEPING After the Moon walk. The upper stage of the Eagle lifts off leaving behind the now useless landing stage and swings into orbit to dock Columbia once again. When the crew and Moon samples are transferred to the command service module the lunar module is discarded. The command service module fires itself out of lunar orbit and falls back to Earth. BEEPING As it approaches the re-entry speed of nearly twenty five thousand miles per hour, the service module drops away. The command module plunges into the atmosphere protected by its heat shield. Slowed still more by the heavy lower atmosphere it parachutes into the sea. The command module, Columbia, is all that remains of the original three thousand tons of rocket fuel and cargo. Apollo 11 this is Houston over. While in Earth orbit, the Apollo crew had less than two hours to check out all their space craft systems. The last chance to discover and correct any malfunction before the third stage engine is restarted to break them free of Earth. The translunar injection. We're ten minutes away from ignition and translunar injection. Apollo 11 this is Houston. You are a go for TLI over. Apollo 11. Thank you. Roger out. Apollo 11 this is Houston, slightly less than one minute to ignition and everything is go. Roger. Ignition. We confirm ignition and the thrust is go. Apollo 11 Roger. Guidance looking good. Velocity twenty six thousand feet per second. Telemetry and radar tracking both solid. Velocity twenty seven thousand eight hundred feet per second. Through the window of the command module, the Earth gently slipped away. Apollo 11, this is Houston. Thrust is good. Everything is still looking good. Roger. Twenty nine thousand feet per second building up toward thirty thousand feet per second. Apollo 11 this is Houston. Three and a half minutes and you're still looking good. Your predicted cut off is right on the nominal. Deep space tracking antennas. A third of a world apart. Listen to Apollo and spoke to Apollo. As the Earth turned, at least one of them would have contact with Apollo at all times except for when it passed behind the Moon. Thirty four thousand feet per second now. Altitude one hundred fifty two. STATIC Thirty-five thousand feet per second. Cut off. With sling velocity thirty five thousand five hundred seventy feet per second. Altitude one hundred seventy seven nautical miles. At three hours eleven minutes into the mission, distance from Earth three thousand one hundred forty nautical miles. The SIVB is reported in a stable altitude for the separation. Apollo 11 this is Houston. You're go for separation. OK... will be coming... down. My tendency is to use bottle primary one for proven checklist, therefore I just turned down. - Roger we concur with the logic. We are awaiting confirmation of separation. Roger. We confirm the separation here on the ground. Apollo 11 this is Houston, radio check. Over. STATIC The Goldstone station reports a very weak signal. We believe that Mike Collins is now manoeuvring the space craft in the transposition and docking manoeuvre and the antenna patterns aren't too good at the moment. So we have a weak signal strength. The command service module separated and turned around to dock with the Eagle of the lunar module. Apollo 11, Apollo 11 this is Houston broadcasting on upline. Request Omni bravo if you read the request. Omni bravo. Out. Apollo 11, this is Houston, how do you read? STATIC Apollo 11 this is Houston radio check over? Roger we are copying you about five by two very weak. Can you give us a status report please? STATIC AND CRACKLING VOICE Loud and clear Mike and we understand that you are docked. That's right. Apollo 11 Houston. We recommend you accept a noun forty nine continue through your sequence of sightings and then we'll analyse the data afterwards over. OK. On board was a fourth brain. A small computer called DSKY which solved problems and helped for the long sequences of systems checks and data exchange with Earth. Houston, Apollo 11, star forty has just disappeared now in the sextant. Could you turn your angle to forty seven... high. Standby. Apollo 11, Houston we like you to press on the star forty four over. Yeah. Roger. They found their way across the sea of space navigating by the same stars that guided Columbus to shores unknown. 11, Houston we copy. Two good marks. Over. OK. Drogue removal is coming next. Roger. Neil Armstrong up in the tunnel at this point removing the probe and drogue assembly, in preparation for the ingress into the lunar module. OK. It's moved now. Coming down. Roger. After docking pressure was equalized. The hatch was open so that the crewmen could float through the tunnel between the two craft to give Eagle a detailed inspection. Its navigation, communication, propulsion, and life support systems. Hey ah vehicle is surprisingly free of any debris floating around it. It's very clean. Roger. Three days falling to the Moon. Free of the gravity of Earth. No up or down. No day or night. A sense of stillness while travelling at the speed of a meteor. Is that about how long it will be before you start closing the LEM back up? Over. An invisible speck in the night. Somewhere between here and there constantly monitored from Earth. Within this tiny space craft a temporary Earth environment. Warmth, air, food, water. Everything necessary to sustain life. Beyond these fragile walls nothingness. Absolute cold. An end to life. The most important function of the space craft, life. Was also monitored constantly through telemetry. The heartbeat and breathing of each astronaut. Although each breath was thirty thousand feet farther from Earth than the breath before it. Should one heart flutter it would at once be a matter of concern to millions worlds away. Unlike any other place man had travelled before, space could provide him with nothing. It is a vacuum. Devoid of every element needed for life. To send man into this nothingness to protect him. It was first necessary to define him. What is the human machine? How does it function? What is the nature of its nervous system? It's respiration? It's circulation? Digestion? Sight? Hearing? Balance? Its endurance? HEARTBEAT What gasses to breathe should he take with him from Earth? What atmospheric pressure suits him best? Is it possible to give him a more efficient atmosphere for space travel than nature provides on Earth? HISSING The Moon is two hundred and fifty degrees hot in Sunlight and two hundred forty degrees below zero in the middle of its night. How long can a man bake or freeze? What protection will he need from this inhuman environment? What strains will the heart take when the pressure of gravity is removed from the limbs? ELECTRICAL HUMMING EXPLOSIONS What protection will the body need from sudden deceleration? Or acceleration? EXPLOSION ELECTRICAL HUMMING Man's sense of direction, speed, and balance are easily fooled. Can his mind be trained to ignore false signals from his senses? ELECTRICAL HUMMING ELECTRICAL HUMMING AND BUZZING BEEP HEART BEATING ENGINE PURRING ENGINE ROARING We were defining the physical man in absolute terms. ENGINE ROARING Once we knew Man's limitations, we could build him an artificial environment for space travel. Columbia, the Command Module was a supreme achievement of the technology of its age. It was a mini planet complete with its own environmental control system, telecommunications, electrical power, guidance, navigation, stabilization, propulsion, reaction control. It provided hot and cold water, and removed carbon dioxide from the air. Three men could live here for more than a week. Eat, work, sleep, shave, exercise, and listen to music. It was micromedia proof, burn proof, and sea worthy, and it could tilt itself in any direction. In short it was the most intricate and sophisticated machine ever made by man. As for man however, was stuck with the original model. All we can do is add an outer layer of things he does not naturally have. Space medicine showed us where man is vulnerable and we learned to compensate for most of the weaknesses with technology and careful workmanship. I made boxing gloves before I came here and the fact is I was an experienced sewer but I had to learn all over again because ah it was completely different from what I had sewed before. This was getting right down to a sixty fourth of an inch and where I sewed before you just sewed on a production line. And this here is quality more than quantity. - Like we always think, our job is the hardest. Whatever we're doing we got the hardest job. But when they say, well who maybe do so and so, and you'll find out that job is harder than yours. And a lot of times we're sewing or making things and maybe the girl next to you she is doing the same thing but we never see the suit put together. We don't know whether this part goes or the other one don't know where the other part goes. Like the gloves, if they give a glove to sew you wouldn't know where to start. - Well when they're up there in space, you know what parts you've worked on and you just say well I hope that part don't fail because I'd feel it was my fault if it did. - My sentiment, just what Hazel said, well I just wondered if my pair of gloves was what he had on. - So if you make a mistake, if you don't admit it you have to think about the astronaut too. Like a needle hole in a bladder or something like that. Well if you don't admit that, that would be on your conscience all the time seems to me. Cause I remember Armstrong and all them used to come in and they would look around to see what we were doing. Once in a while they would talk to us and we'd get them to sign their autograph. Some of them were real comical. We got a kick out of them. We all want to talk to them again. I remember one of them going down the isle and everybody looked at him, looked at him afraid to talk. I said hi buddy. - Oh. I'd love to go into space. I think it would be really thrilling. Just to get in there and just blast off. I'd love to go to space and just live there. Everyday you get up. You come to work. You go home. You clean house. If you go out there, there's no house, no kids, no problems! I like to ride an airplane and I think I'd like to go into space. And I'd like to wear our own suit that we make. I think I can depend on it. ELECTRICAL HUMMING MUSIC After body electrodes have been attached to monitor heart beat and breathing, the first items of clothing are the water cool underwear and a urine collector. A space suit is basically a sealed bag of atmosphere. Stiffened balloon pumped up to counteract the vacuum of space. It might be called a one man space ship of the smallest possible dimensions. The pressure suit has to guard against extreme temperatures. Hard radiation from the Sun and tiny meteorites, yet it must have the flexibility to allow man to function as he would in his natural Earth environment. MUSIC MUSIC The back pack cleans and cools the suit's oxygen. Cools and circulates water through the water cool underwear and provides radio communication. Over the pressure helmet is a clear visor. Then a gold coated visor to protect against micro meteors and solar radiation. The final test was how would the suit work in the silent, weightless world of space? MUSIC Weightlessness on Earth can be experienced only under water or in an airplane following a parabolic flight path. MUSIC The only true test was in space itself. MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC No up or down. No day or night. Only the slow creeping of the harsh Sunlight through the windows as the space craft rotates to keep from getting too hot on one side and too cold on the other. MUSIC They carried with the them the biological day of the Earthling. Three meals, a snack or two. Eight hours of sleep. Time to work. Time to relax. Time to reflect. Three days falling upward to the Moon. Look down. Look down. That fragile bubble of life afloat on a sea of nothing. Space ship Earth.

OK first off looks like it is going to be impossible to get away from the fact that you guys are dominating all the news back here on Earth. Even Pravda in Russia is headlining the mission and calls Neil the Tsar of the ship. I think maybe they got the wrong mission. Among the large headlines concerning Apollo this morning, is one asking that you watch for a lovely girl with a big rabbit. Very interesting! Hello there. An ancient legend says a beautiful Chinese girl called Chango has been living there for four thousand years. It seems she was banished to the Moon because she stole the pill of immortality from her husband. You might also look for her companion, a large Chinese rabbit who is easy to spot since he is always standing on his hind feet in the shade of a cinnamon tree. The name of the rabbit is not reported. Okay, we'll keep a close eye for the bunny girl. And in Corby England, an Irishman John Coil has won the world's porridge eating championship by consuming twenty three bowls of instant oatmeal in a ten minute time limit from a field of thirty five other competitors. Over. I ought to enter Aldrin into the oatmeal eating contest next time. He's on his nineteenth bowl. Roger.

MULTIPLE LANGUAGES REPORTING And the world waited. July 20th, 1969. It is said that five hundred million people gathered at TV sets around the world to wait for the first Earthling to set foot on the Moon. Countless millions more listened on the radio to the voices from the Moon. Houston, ah, this is Neil. Radio check. Neil this is Houston loud and clear.... Never before had so many people been attuned to one event at one time. MULTIPLE LANGUAGES REPORTING The world waited. Curious, wondering, aware like a sleeper wakened in the night by a far away sound. A moment sensed more than understood. BEEP OK Neil. We can see you coming down the ladder now. Okay, I just checked getting back up to that first step. It's not even collapsed too far, but it's adequate to get back up. Roger we copy. I'm at the foot of the ladder, the LEM footpads are only depressed in the surface about one or two inches. Although the surface appears to be very very fine grained as you get close to it. It's almost like a powder. It's very fine. OK. I'm going to step off the LM now. That's one small step for man. One giant leap for Mankind. That's one small step for man yet one giant leap for Mankind. MULTIPLE LANGUAGES REPORTING MULTIPLE LANGUAGES REPORTING Ah that looks beautiful from here now. It has a stark beauty all of its own. It's like much of the high desert of the United States. It's ah different but it's very pretty out here. Are you getting a TV picture now Houston? Neil, yes we are getting a TV Picture...now. OK ready for me to come out? All set. Okay I am on the top step at the very simple matter to hop down from one step to the next. You got three more steps and then a long one. Okay I am going to leave that one foot up there and both hands down about the fourth rung up. There you go. INDISTINCT CHATTER A little more about another inch. Hey you got it! That's a good step. Beautiful view. Ain't that something? Magnificent sight out here. INDISTINCT CHATTER Very very fine powder isn't it? Isn't it fine? And Neil, didn't I say we might see some purple rocks? And the purple rocks. Yes. Very small sparkly fragments. Okay Houston, I'm going to change lenses on you. Roger Neil. You're going too fast on the panorama sweep. You're going to have to stop for... I haven't stop. I haven't set it down yet. That's the first picture in the panorama. Okay I am going to move it. Tell me if you get a picture Houston. We got a beautiful picture Neil. Okay we got that one. Okay. There's another good one. For a final orientation, we'd like it to come left about five degrees over. OK. Okay that looks good there Neil. Buzz is erecting the solar wind experiment now. Every precious minute of their two and a half hours on the surface was programmed. Rock and soil samples were to be collected. Photographs taken. Experiments set up to catch unfiltered particles from the Sun. To record Moon quakes. To measure precisely why laser beam reflection the exact distance between Moon and Earth. Columbia, Columbia. This is Houston AOS over. Houston, Columbia over. Roger the EVA is progressing beautifully. Setting up the flag now. I guess you are about the only person around that doesn't have TV coverage of this scene. That's alright. I don't mind it a bit. They've got the flag up now and you can see the stars and stripes on Moon. Beautiful just beautiful. How is the quality of the TV? Ah, it's beautiful Mike. Really is. I'd like to evaluate the various paces that a person... travelling on the lunar surface can make. You do have to be careful to keep track of where your centre of mass is. Sometimes it takes about two or three paces to make sure you got your feet underneath you. At about two of three to four easy paces can bring you to a fairly smooth stop. Like a football pro just have to cut off to the side a little bit. A kangaroo hop. That works on your forward stability, but not quite as good. It could get rather tiring after several hundred but this may be a function of the suit as well as a lack of gravity forces. ELECTRICAL HUMMING AND STATIC I noticed in the soft spots where we have footprints nearly an inch deep that the soil is very cohesive and it will retain a slope of probably 70 degrees on the side of the foot print. Buzz is making his way around the LEM photographing it from various angles. Looking at its conditions on all sides. Now right here in this area there are two craters. The one that is right in front of me now is as I look off in about the eleven o'clock position from facing that. It's about thirty to thirty five feet... Roger Out. HUMMING AND STATIC In the foreground Buzz Aldrin is collecting a core tube sample. I hope you're watching how hard I have to hit this into the ground to the tune of about five inches Houston. Roger. It almost looks wet. Ah, Buzz this is Houston. You've got about ten minutes left now prior to commencing your EVA termination activities. Over. Roger. I understand. It's marvellous. - Absolutely fantastic. - The first person on the Moon. You know it's just too much. I can't get over it. - I don't know how to put it. You know, but it's most marvellous thing it's a miracle. - This is... I don't know. - We are really thrilled. - For every American this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world... - I think it's great. Really great for the whole world. - This means a lot to all the countries not just for America. - And being out of it and being closer to the Moon makes us realize that we're all human beings together. I hope this brings unity amongst all countries. And I just hope it helps you to solve all the internal problems you may have. - Well I think it is a waste of a lot of money that could be used for something else. They holler about the people being on starvation. - It's huge amount of money American spend to see what the Moon is like. What's for? - It's disgusting. It's a pity that they haven't got something else to do. Been better if they done something for the old-uns. - What if Columbus had decided that he just couldn't get the money from Isabella, where would we be? - That's one of God's celestial planets and he put it in the sky for a purpose. And he didn't put people to clutter up like they have the Earth. - Myself, I'm really interested to see what's up there. - We must open all secrets that are opening to us throughout the ages. - I think that the dream of the man from the beginning of the human race is coming now Alone forty five miles above the Moon's surface, Michael Collins completed an orbit every two hours. He listened to the progress of the Moon walk and awaited the moment when his companions on the surface would lift off to rendezvous with him. ELECTRICAL HUMMING AND STATIC For thirty times he saw the Earth rise over the horizon of the Moon. Twelve thousand miles of twilight. A line that divides night from day for three billion people on space ship Earth. It is good to see the whole Earth. To see the Earth whole. SLOW BEEPING HUMMING AND BUZZING HUMMING AND BUZZING The Eagle had left the Moon and returned to Columbia. HUMMING AND BUZZING Within this strange ship two astronauts and a treasure. Triple sealed vacuum boxes of rocks and soil from the surface of the Moon. HUMMING AND BUZZING Locked within these rocks were secrets of the ages to be studied and deciphered by the scientist of Earth. The age of the Moon. The age of the Sun. How the Moon was formed. How life began? Was there ever life on the Moon? Was the Moon once molten and volcanic or has it always been cold and dead? Was it once part of the Earth? Or was it a wondering planet captured by the Earth eons ago? MELODIC BUZZING AND HUMMING How hot was the Sun three billion years ago? BUZZING AND HUMMING When Armstrong and Aldrin with their precious load of Moon rocks had transferred to Columbia the faithful Eagle, its task completed, could be cut adrift. Columbia fired out of lunar orbit to begin its three day fall back to Earth where the recovery fleet was waiting for its splash down in the Pacific. MUSIC Apollo 11, Houston with a little recovery force information. Over. Go ahead. Roger. The Hornet is on the station just far enough off the target point to keep from getting hit. Recovery one.... July 24th, the Hornet was on station and the President of the United States was aboard. Re-entry into the Earth's invisible atmosphere carries with it one of the most critical moments. Travelling nearly twenty five thousand miles per hour, the command module can miss the angle of re-entry by only several degrees and disintegrate into flames or bounce off into space never to return. Velocity 33,000 feet per second. 35,000 feet per second now. 36,000 feet per second. Board entry time. LOUD STATIC There's black out.

MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC SIRENS AND MUSIC MUSIC CROWD AMBIENCE What was it we were really celebrating? Three men who had done what no man before had done. A technological feat was believed beyond the realm of possibility. The fulfilment of an age old dream? Were we celebrating simply because it had been a long time since we had anything to celebrate? Or was this something that touched an irrational unthinking instinct in us all? MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC HISSING AND RINGING ELECTRICAL HUMMING A treasure of the ages. Stones from across the night. Unrubbed by wind. Unwashed by rain. Scattered on tranquillity. Bombarded by solar particles for billions of years but unchanged in any other way. A Moon rock is like a diary of the Sun. An eye unblinking since time began. It stared across the sea of space. It watched the blue planet when life began. RATTLING RATTLING Remembered in these rocks are ancient Sun spots, solar flares, solar storms who's fiery arms reached out a million miles. CLICKING By making ourselves very small like Alice, perhaps we will see what these rocks have seen. And remember back those billions of years to decipher the life of the Sun. MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC Locked within our Sun are answers to mysteries that have confounded man since time began. We have reached out with our telescopes. We have reached in with our microscopes. Seeking. What is the source of life? What combination of energies and elements brought it into existence? What is the relationship between the non living and living things? How delicate is the balance? Man slowly begins to realize how fragile is his bubble of life? MUSIC Ours is one Sun in a sea of Suns more plentiful than all the grains of sand on all the shores of all the seas of planet Earth. MUSIC Now that we are free to wander from Earth. Perhaps we will find the answers to our questions. Someday we may know where we've come from. Where we're going. We may know where is the end, where is the beginning. MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC We have walked on the Moon. We open our minds to the universe. MUSIC
