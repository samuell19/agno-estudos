There's an area for, too babe. We have to remodel it a little bit, you know? But it's there. And what are we supposed to tell my parents, Marcus? Tell 'em the truth. Marijuana's legal now, babe. So we're not doin' anything wrong, it's a business opportunity. Just please give it a chance, baby. Please give it a chance, baby. I promise you. I promise gon' love it. Sure, whatever. Oh my god, this place looks like a hotel or something. Yeah, just wait 'til you see the inside. I did not expect this at all. Okay, so the furniture inside, it's pretty old, but don't pay any attention to that, all right? Just look at the design of the house. You'll love it. It's so dope. Okay. Hey, what are you doing? Isn't it tradition to carry you into our new home? No, babe. It's a tradition to carry your bride into a new home. We ain't married yet. Whatever, girl. Lemme just get you in this house before my back go out on me. Wow. I knew you'd like it. Trust me, baby. Once I get these weed plants goin', we gon' make so much fucking money that we can make this place look dope. It definitely needs a thorough cleaning, but it's amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my god. This is beautiful. Told you. I'm gonna help you with any remodeling ideas you like. Help? Well it would've been helpful if you came and talked to me before you went to this auction. C'mon babe, stop that. But, I'm so glad you did. This place is the bomb! Yeah, it's yo kitchen, girl. We're not there yet? Jeez. There's no service up here. GPS keeps saying it's loading. So we're lost? I guess so. What? Aw crap, I don't have signal either. What's the address again? 1517 Springcrest Road. Turn left here. Left? Left. Okay but I don't wanna get lost, Miss Leah. Trust me. Something is telling me this is the way to go. Just turn left, go. Okay, now we're on a dirt road. Oh. Wait, it says it's right there. See? Told ya. Damn, that was a lucky guess, Leah. Call it a woman's intuition. Happens to me all the time. This is really not what I was expecting. Not at all, no. Wow. Wow. Did she talk. Now I'm like excited. What? Seriously, how did they get this place? That is the question. Seriously. Okay. Here. Thank you. Yeah. Wow, this is crazy. Here you go, babe. Oh,. Yeah. Oh sorry. It's so big, wow. Hey. Welcome, welcome. Hey girl! Hi. These boys didn't drive you crazy on the drive up, did they? Oh, not at all. My man. They're so sweet and I slept the whole way up anyway. My man. Whassup, baby? Yo, I'm so happy to be here. Man, you didn't tell me this place was this big. You said you bought a little cottage or somethin'. This is crazy. Can you believe this? It's amazing. Like I had no idea. This is why I said it was a steal, bro. Like it's massive. I don't know what I would do without you. You're gonna help me decorate everything. I got you, girl. Super. I got you, girl. Yes, great. Welcome, man. Thanks. Oh hey. What up, sis? Hey, sweetie. Look, thanks so much for coming and thank you for giving my girl a ride up here. Of course. Grace, this is Dominic. Hi, beautiful. Hi, Dom. It's so nice to finally meet you. Nice to meet you. Thanks for having us. Of course. Hey, congrats on the new digs. Y'all are big time now. Yeah, don't congratulate us just yet. Let's see how Marcus can turn a profit first. Hey, put that down. We got everything. You just show me the house. This place is amazing. I'm so happy to be here. I was a little worried, not gonna lie. Did you get lost? Yes, yes. A little bit? Wow. Oh wow, the house came furnished too? Yup, the old owners left everything except their personal belongings. That's cool. But it hasn't been cleaned yet, so we're leavin' it covered for the weekend. Oh my god, I am a sucker for fireplaces and this one is beautiful. I know, right? I love it. It's gonna be so cozy when it's cold out. And I can totally see like a beautiful painting or a mirror up there. See? That's why I called you, girl. I need your eyes and interior decorating skills to help me with this place. Yup, this house has definitely a lot of potential. It is stunning, actually. I'm sorry, Leah. I didn't quite get that. What'd you say there? I said this house has a lot of potential. See, baby? Whatever. You're not outta the doghouse yet, mister. Lemme show you guys to your rooms. Is over here? I'm trippin' over this place. It is enormous. Well here you go, Leah. The room is small, but the beds seem comfortable. I'm sure it's fine, thanks. Well make yourself at home and come down whenever you're ready. I'll make us skinny margaritas. Yes, please. And you two'll be sleepin' right over here. And this room is for you guys. Nice. Ooh. Sorry. The mattress pad and sheets are new, but not the mattress. But trust me, we disinfected the hell out of it. Hey look, Marcus already told us there's old furniture in here, so we're all good. It's like we're camping. No it's more like glamping, honey. Hey, thank you for everything. No, thank you guys for being here. I swear if you weren't here, I might kill your best friend. I now have hope that this might not be such a bad investment. Are you kidding me? This house is incredible. You guys are definitely gonna make that money with the Mary Jane. Well let's hope so. Look, relax a bit. Marcus is gonna start barbecuing soon and he got tequila. Hey! So make sure you hydrate. Hell yeah, mama. Thanks, Grace. Okay. Hey, you're gonna have to chill with the remarks. What? I didn't even say anything. You didn't have to. Your face said it all. Look, my boy's trying really hard to get his girl happy about this house, so try to be optimistic okay? I am being optimistic. I just told her how much I liked the fireplace. Good. Keep it up, playboy. Now roll me one of those signature joints so I can decompress. We both need to decompress. I know that's right. Here is your prescription. Ooh, shank you. Boop. A? I mean it ain't gonna light itself, babe. So this motherfucker decides it's time for payback two fuckin' years later. Told you I never forget. That's right. So we're all in the auditorium for a rally right before the game and this fool is in the front row. He's clappin', he's hollerin' all loud. As soon as the guy gets up to speak, you see Marcus' whole demeanor change. His eyes get all dark and shit. And not two minutes in to the speech, he gets up, he runs over to this sucker and pulls his pants down around his ankles. Everybody saw his tiny little pinky dick and busted out laughin'. Yo, that shit was hilarious! That poor guy. That is so awful, Marcus. Is that why you didn't graduate high school? Hold up, hold up. I graduated; I just wasn't able to walk the stage for my diploma, but I didn't give a fuck. That prick was so damn cocky and bullying everybody. Did you get your ass kicked after that? Yeah, by his mama. Yeah, she beat my ass that day. I mean he did too later that summer, but I didn't care. I mean I feel like I wasn't gettin' payback just for me, but for the whole damn school. Yes. You know what I'm sayin'? Like fuckin' Brian Miller, man. Yeah, jackass. The little-dick jackass. Oh no no, I can't take another one. I'm drunk, guys. Hey, you have to. Yes. Plus, I'm faded already too. Come on, Leah. I got you a big one. Fine, but you are cleanin' up my vomit later. Cheers. Is it like that? I didn't know that. Cheers. Salud! Brian! I got to piss like crazy. Where's the bathroom again? Babe, can you show him where it is? I got you, man. C'mon. Oh my god. Come on. All right, end of the hall. Yeah. To the left. Got it. Shit, it's a closet. I know you have some embarrassing stories about Phil too. I wanna know everything. Leah? Oh shit. My bad, bro. Had to get a towel. Your new boyfriend spilled his beer all over me. He did? Yeah. It's all good though, man. 'Bout to take this shit off anyway. You know what they say, "It ain't a party 'til somebody spills a drink." I think this party's over anyway. What? It's like 10:30. Yeah, I know. But me, I'm not tryin' to be hungover for tomorrow. You know Grace about to put my ass to work. She sure is. You know she is. C'mon, man. Gee. Your hair, I just love it. Yeah. Marcus tell you I spilled a beer on him? I'm such an idiot. He did. I was way too animated, tellin' a story and just knocks you right into it. Seriously, bro. It's all good. I'm 'bout to change and go to bed anyway. Yes, we should all go to bed because we have a busy day tomorrow gettin' this place in order. Actually I'm exhausted from the drive, so we're ready for bed too. I brought our coffee pot with us and I got some good stuff for breakfast. Ooh, I can help. I have an inner Ina Garten inside of me just dyin' to get out. Ooh, wonderful. Seven a.m., you guys. Oh c'mon, babe. Seriously? More like nine please? C'mon. It's the weekend, come on. Fine, nine it is. Wow. There's some bottles of water in the fridge, you guys. You'll thank me in the morning. Thank you, babe. Thank you, Grace. So what do you think of Dominic? He's cool. Phil seems to really like him. Yeah, I can see that. He's really nice. As long as Phil's happy, I'm happy. So. Are you happy or are you still mad at me? Still mad at you. Baby, this house was a steal at the auction. All I was tryin' to do was invest in somethin' to make us some money for our future, that's all. I know that. But you have to talk to me about these things, okay? We're a team, so I wanna be a part of all the decisions from now on. Got it. Understood. Now get over here and gimme some booty. Lemme clean up first. I'll be right back. Hurry up. Marcus! Marcus. The hell is this? Hey girl. Hey. Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the bed. I'm sorry, guys. I just didn't sleep well at all. Oh, you too? Marcus couldn't sleep either. I just had a really bad dream. All that alcohol. I always have crazy dreams when I'm drunk too. It was just terrible. You'll feel better once you eat somethin'. Yes, eat. I need you today. I brought all of these with me to give you an idea of some of the things I wanna do in here. Okay I'm sure once I eat, I'll feel better. Let's do it. Yay, I'm so excited. Lemme grab these plates. Can you tell the boys that breakfast is ready? They're outside. Sure. Strike. Damn it, man! Man, you cheatin' bro. Strike. Damn it! Hey guys, breakfast is ready. Oh hey, Leah. Hey, Leah. C'mon man, one more bro. One more. All right. All right man, don't be mad when I strike your ass out. Yeah, baby. Hell yeah! That's what I'm talkin' 'bout, P! That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. Why you mad, P? Don't be mad. Don't be mad, P. Finally, I thought I was playin' with my grandma there for a minute. Oh really? Okay. Your grandma, huh? Yeah, my grandma. Okay. Please, you know my grandma. I know, she's humongous. Humongous? Yeah, but she's got a donk. She's a good cook. She can cook really good. That looks good. Ooh okay, babe. Look at you. Damn, this look good. Thank you. Don't thank me. Dominic basically did everything. I practically took over her kitchen. Sorry, Grace. Please, I loved it. Look, we're gettin' pizza tonight, but you can help me make dinner tomorrow since you love to cook. My pleasure. Whoa, Dominic. I don't know what you put in these eggs, but they're the best I've ever had. All the praise goes to Barefoot Contessa. Her recipes never fail. Oh no, none of that. You need to drink more coffee, Marcus. I don't know, I'm just so tired though. You mean hungover. Nah man, I couldn't sleep with all the noise. I'm still surprised none of y'all heard it. Leah, you didn't hear it? I didn't, no. That shit is crazy. It was so loud like scratchin' or somethin'. I think we might have mice. Mice? Yeah. You guys need to check that out today. I can't live with rodents in here. I mean maybe there's some traps or somethin' in the shed out there. Don't worry, we take care of it. Oh no no no, I don't do mice and sheds and stuff. Just kitchens. Fine, us real men will tackle it. Real men? I got your real man right here. Yeah, man. The hell is this? I have no idea. That shit has a little spring thing on the door for opening and closing. That's pretty cool. Wow, there's a lotta shit in here. I know, right? We need to get rid of it before Grace sees it. Definitely. Then maybe you could turn this into a game room or somethin'. Yeah, maybe a workout room. My punching bag, boxin' equipment and shit. Look at you. You know, I could be. Damn it, man. Who am I kiddin', bro? This room's gonna be whatever Grace wants it to be. Exactly. What the fuck? Exactly, knowin' that is half the battle. Shit! That fuckin' spring thing. Hold on, bro. I got a flashlight. There we go. I wouldn't even fuckin'. What we lookin' at? So they left you a horse. Cute. That's funny? How are you gonna find anything up in here? We just fuckin' look at everything. Fuckin' see. Shit, so much random shit in here. Oh okay, okay. Hold this for me, brother. I got you. Thanks, man. A mixture of kid toys and shit. What happened? Where's the flashlight, bro? I dropped it. I'm tryin' to find it now. God, dude. Oh man, c'mon bro. Phil? Yeah. You find it now? I got it. What'd you see, man; A rat or somethin'? Nah, I thought I saw somethin'. But I was trippin'. Here. Maybe there's somethin' in there. All right. Look, this is what I was talking about for your bedroom. It's rustic chic, but it still has those warm tones so you can relax. Yes, I love that. Yeah, with those curtains too. Cute. It's gonna look so good, plus it's gonna help you guys get in the mood. Yeah we'll need it, girl. You know, Marcus is like a old man. He passes out after five minutes of being in bed nowadays. Oh no, really? Yes, girl. I tease him and tell him he's not supposed to be actin' like that until after we're married. Yeah, that is true. But enough about me, how are things with you in the love department? Nonexistent. Really? Mm-hmm. So you haven't been with anyone since Kevin? Nope. My god, Leah. That was two years ago. Don't remind me. Do you miss him? Not anymore. And what about sex? Please tell me you're at least gettin' some. Nope, not that either. In two years? I know. Did I just hear you say two years? Whoa, you eavesdropping on us? No, I was going around the house tryin' to find a place to get reception so I can Snapchat, but there's not a single fucking signal in here. I know, sorry. We're havin' someone set up the cable and wifi next week. Okay two years without sex is unacceptable, honey. What's really goin' on? Exactly, that's what I wanna know. Look if I had a choice, I'd be having sex all the time. But I don't. Ooh yes you do, girl. You're a hot piece of ass. Don't give us that shit. I've been busy getting my business off the ground. I've had more than eight clients this year and thankfully, it's been great. Been super busy. Babe, you've got to find time in your life for yourself too. And now you sound like my mother. Listen, when the right guy comes along, I'll be so ready. But until then, I'm focusing on me and my business, okay? Well at least get yourself a vibrator. Who says I don't have one? Ooh, I don't know. Oh hey, guys. Thought you were never comin' back. Bad news. There's no traps in the greenhouse. We have to go in town to get some. I'll roll with you if you want. Well, I wanna go too. See the town. All right, cool. So y'all wanna go now? We could set some traps before dark. Yeah, let's all go. I just got to get my shoes. Let's see what's in here right quick. Random lady. Wow, they're pretty. Oh my god. What? What is it? Remember when I told you I had a really bad dream last night? Yeah? This young girl was in my dream. Get the fuck outta here. No way. I swear to god. She was in my dream and it was creepy as hell. What happened in the dream? She was living in this house. But the house was different. That don't sound creepy to me. It got creepy after that. She was painting and then she got all scary. I don't remember. Guys, I'm serious. She was in my dream. I believe you. It's just weird as hell. Look let's go into town, get the traps and grab some lunch. I wanna see what this city has to offer. And I wanna get a tour of the grounds before it gets dark. All right,. Let's do it. All right, let's just get outta here. - Where are you takin' us? - You? Damn, this is almost as big as the house itself. It's crazy, bro. It was probably, dude. Actual greenhouse. Yeah. It's like actually green. Of course I can help you with the door. This right here is where we gon' make our millions. Gonna use that area over there; It'll turn it into like a greenhouse, you know? We'll grow the best weed in California. Yeah. That's what's up. Do you already have all your seeds and stuff? Nah but you know, I get 'em. I'm takin' an online course on how to grow right now. It seemed pretty easy. Hold up. You don't even smoke weed. How you gonna grow it? It's agriculture, man. I'll figure it out. Well you are in Ojai, where some of the best pot comes from. See? Look man, I can help you out with this if you want. I mean if you need a business partner. Get the fuck outta here, man. You are the last person I need around my weed plants. Oh, it's like that? Yeah, it's like that. Okay. I'm just sayin' I'm here if you need me. Okay. Or if you need someone to test that shit out. We got you, right? If he needs somebody to test that shit out right, babe? Hey, what are you lookin' at over there? Oh nothin', it's just a lotta wood. I know, right? It came with the property too. Hey, you guys should bring some of that wood up to the house. We could use it by the fireplace 'cause you know it's gonna get cold later. For sure. Not now. Let's go and try and get the traps before it gets dark. All right. "Not now." Man, Grace got you pussy whipped. Yup, just the way I like it. You don't know what you're missin', bro. Get off me, fool. Gracie come to me, baby! Hello. Hi, I'm Grace and this is my fiance Marcus and these are our friends. We just moved into the house here. Oh wow. Welcome. Listen, you happen to have a card on you or somethin'? We're gonna need a good gardener or someone to help us out with all this land. Sorry, no. Okay, do you know anyone around here that may be able to help us out then? No, I don't. You are a gardener, aren't you? Yes, I am. Listen man, is there a reason why you can't help us out? Look, I'm just you know, really busy. I have a lotta clients. Do you know who might've worked with the people that lived here before? No. Did you even know the people that lived here before? I didn't know them, but I heard about them. Heard of them? What do you mean? I meant I heard that they lived here. Okay look, I really got to go. Okay. Is it me or was that guy kinda weird? Yeah, he was interesting. Do you think he was crazy or something? I don't know, just weird. And did you hear what he said about the people that lived here? He heard they lived here. Maybe he just meant he heard of who they were. I don't know, somethin' was off about him. I know that's right. Let's go. Let's get tequila. Yeah, tequila. C'mon, babe. You got this. Doin' it, baby. Doin' this for you. Yes. Baby. Yeah! That right there. Woo. Nice. All right Marcus, you're up. Okay okay, let's see what we got. I'ma go with this one. C'mon, get out. Get out. Yes. Two for you, baby! Your turn. Wait, whoa whoa. Why are you guys picking on me? You just gave me a shot before Grace! Oh no it's nothin' personal, man. I'm a gentleman, so I'm not gonna be handin' out drinks to the ladies. You just give me a shot. I'm not gonna be handin' out drinks to the ladies anymore. Babe, you don't let me finish. Just take your shot, Dom. C'mon, you're slowin' down the game. Whatever. I told you guys it's literally impossible to get me drunk, so you can just ganging up on me if you want, all right? Yeah! Who the fuck is that? I don't know. Maybe they were just turning around. Seriously, turnin' around all the way up the damn driveway? You guys should keep that gate locked. Probably right. Whose turn is it? Mine. Let's see what I do. Two for you, baby. No way, you guys are definitely cheating. No fucking way! Come on. C'mon, take it. Shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot. Yeah! 'Attaboy. That's how you take it. So are you gonna tell me why you're upset or are you just gonna stand there, give me the silent treatment? Do I have to tell you what I'm upset about? Well I'm not a mind reader, Dominic. So please, by all means. How 'bout you and your high school sweetheart, Marcus, down there? Oh my god, high school sweetheart? He's my best friend! My oldest friend. We should be best friends. Are you really gonna make this a competition now? You're my boyfriend. Now of course you're gonna turn this into pitting me... okay, I would just never treat you like that with my friends and you know it. Oh, god. I've been nothing but good to you. Yeah because you're so perfect. I know. Hey, stay outta their business. Shh, be quiet. Can't hear. You shouldn't be listenin'. You are turning this into something that it's not. We were just fucking with you. It's like an initiation! It's something we used to do back in the neighborhood. Well excuse the hell outta me for not understanding the rules of your neighborhood. Fuck this. You could've at least warned me, Phil! Warn you? You need a warning? It's a simple fucking game, what's the big deal? Jesus. And any fucking time you open your mouth around him, I don't even understand who you are anymore. Seriously, Dominic? Yes! Fucking relax! We were just fucking with you! Turning this into a fuckin' now you're a victim again. Typical. You got to take the attention and make it all about you. We were having a good weekend. It was a simple fucking game. We were all having fun. Yeah, we were teasing you a little bit. Big fucking deal. Fuck you, Phil. Great. Shit. Come on. Seriously? Fuck. Come on, c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon. Wait. There. There we go. C'mon, stay stay stay. Yes! Okay. What's up, y'all? I know it's been a while since you've seen me, but I have been stuck up here in Ojai for the last couple of days with zero reception. Plus no cable, no phone, no nothing. I realize now that I am addicted to social media and so this is the first and the last time that I will be coming up into the boondocks. I mean unless of course someone wants to invite me to a five-star vineyard and then count me in. Anyways it's two a.m. and I can't sleep, so I just thought I'd come up here into the wilderness. See? Okay, you probably can't see because it's dark as fuck out here. Anyways, I just wanted to send you guys a video and see what's goin' on in the real world. See you soon, bitches. What's up, y'all? It's about two a.m. right now and I can't sleep, so I thought I would just walk all the way out here into the wilderness. See? What the fuck? Hey guys, did you see that shit or am I goin' crazy? Maybe it's just cabin fever. I got to get the fuck outta here. He's coming. Ow. Oh my god, what are you doin' in here? I heard loud screaming and I wanted to check on you. Screaming? I was screaming? I had another nightmare. Something's not right, Grace. What? What do you mean? What was your dream about? Someone was killed. It was awful. I'm so sorry. Do you want me to stay in here with you? Please, please. I can't stay here alone. It's okay, just close your eyes. It'll be okay. Good morning. Hey, Leah. Morning. I see you finally got some sleep. Oh yeah, finally. Well, coffee's hot. I just made a fresh pot since you all missed the first one I made at eight a.m. I can't tell you the last time I slept this late. Well I'm just glad you were able to go back to sleep. I was worried about you. Grace told me. You had a nightmare? Yeah it was so strange, but I was able to sleep like a baby after you walked in. What's up, guys? Morning. Yo. Hey, Phil. Here, take this one. Oh, thanks. I didn't cook this morning, but there's bagels and cream cheese in the fridge. Cool. Where's Dominic? We haven't seen him this morning. We thought he was with you. No. When I woke up this morning, he was gone. That's weird. I've been up since about 7:30 and I haven't seen him at all this morning. Whatever. He probably just wants me to worry. We got into a fight last night. Really? We know, man. The hell were you guys arguin' about? What, you heard us? Of course we did. I'm pretty sure the whole fuckin' neighborhood heard y'all. Damn. It was stupid. Nothing, really. But Dom gets so worked up about these things; Maybe he went for a walk or something. It's a pretty long walk. Are you sure he didn't leave? Is the car still here? Yeah, I already checked. The car's outside, all his stuff is here. Trust me. Guys, he's just looking for attention. He probably went on the longest walk so that I could be worried about him. I know him too well. Where could he possibly go around here though? Yeah, man. Maybe we should go look for him. We should definitely go look for him. No! I mean this is exactly what he wants, attention. I'm not giving it to him. Maybe he took a walk and got lost. You should be worried, Phil. I agree. And I'm sorry guys, but I don't have a good feeling about this. Fine, I'll go look for him. Can I finish my coffee first? I'll come with you, bro. We'll all go. Wonderful. What'd you do, Dominic man. Dominic! Dominic! Dom! Dominic! What the fuck, man? I feel we walk at least two miles already. Why can't we just get in the car and drive around? Dominic! You're right, Leah. Let's just go get the car. And what, drive all the way back into town? That's at least seven miles. What else do you suggest, Phil? I'm telling you if he walked seven miles, he wouldn't come back. He's probably back in LA laughing at us right now. But didn't you say he left all his stuff in the house? Exactly. The only thing I didn't see was his cellphone, which doesn't surprise me one bit. And what about this morning, you didn't hear him wake up or last night? You kiddin' me? Phil could sleep through a hurricane. I'll tell you one thing, I'm gonna kick his ass when I see him. This shit isn't funny anymore. Let's just walk down that way and check here real quick. The fuck is he at, man? Dom! Excuse me! Excuse me. Hey. Sorry to disturb you, but we're lookin' for our friend. Have you seen anyone wandering around here? Is someone missin'? Yeah, we have a friend who wasn't at our house. We thought maybe he took a hike and got lost, but we haven't been able to find him. Caucasian, 'bout six feet tall, blond hair. Here here, this is him. Sorry man, I haven't seen anyone. But I just started my shift and I'm gonna be workin' late tonight, so I can give you a call if I see anything. Yeah, unfortunately our phone service doesn't work out here. Can I give you our address? In case you see him, maybe you could ride him up to the house. Sure. Our address is 1517 Springcrest Road. Got that? You guys bought that house? Yeah. Wow. Yeah, I drove by there last night because I saw lights on. Oh, so that was you in our driveway. Yeah, I came up because I didn't know the house finally sold. I was shocked to see people moved in. What do you mean by that? Well there've been a lot of people and animals that went missing here, so most people sold their homes and left town. Wait, really? So the town is deserted? Okay look, I'm not gonna bullshit you guys. Did your realtor tell you about the people that lived in that house? No, didn't have a realtor. Okay look, I've only been working security for over a year, so I don't have details. But a couple years ago, the people in that house went missing. What? Were they ever found? Actually it was a woman and her daughter and no, no one ever found them. Their blood was all over the house, but no bodies. Wait wait, are you serious? As a heart attack. It's the same woman and daughter from my dreams. I mean at first, they thought it was her ex-husband, but his alibi panned out. This is fucked up. Look, you guys seem like really cool people so I don't wanna lie to you, okay? There's just been way too many people that have gone missing in this area; Dead animals and shit. That's why they hired me. Oh my god. Wait, so how many people have gone missing? So far, think like 30 people. Oh my god, get the fuck outta here. But it's been happening for years. Well that's why everyone moved outta the neighborhood, especially because they can't find one of those children from that cult. Danny, somethin'? I can't remember. A kid in a cult? Yeah, there was a big cult here back in the day doin' crazy stuff, then they did a sting operation. But by the time they caught up to them, every single member had committed suicide besides one of the children, Danny. He got away and no one has ever found him. Come on, you guys seriously don't know any of this? Hell no, man. We're from LA! I knew there was somethin' wrong here. I'm sorry, guys. I just thought you guys should know what's up. Look, I wasn't even gonna take this job because all this stuff. But you know, I just had a baby girl and I need the money. One thing for sure, I don't get outta this car if I don't have to. You guys should take care of yourselves out there. We won't be living here after all, so don't worry about us. Look, I'll my eyes open for your friend. If I see him, I'll drive him to your place. Thank you. Of course. Good luck. I can't believe you didn't look into the history of the house before you bought it, Marcus. I did. I Googled it and saw nothing. Aren't they supposed to tell you that by law? They didn't mention it, bro. Okay you guys, I'm really worried about Dominic now. Yeah. I think we should just pack our stuff and go. And what if he comes back to the house and we're not there? I'm not leaving him stranded out here. Look, let's just go back to the house. Maybe he's there. And what if he's not? I'm not spending one more night in that house. I wanna leave ASAP. Yeah I agree, I'm ready to go. You guys, we cannot leave him out here. I'm not doing that. Look there's only a few hours of daylight, man. We'll go back to the house. We'll pack our stuff up. If he's not there before we leave, then we'll go see the police. Is that cool? 'Kay. All right, let's go. I don't wanna be here when it gets dark. Fuck! All right, bags are packed and ready to go. Great, this is ready. We can eat then go. I'm not hungry at all, Grace. I just wanna find Dom. You said you wanted to wait a while in case he came back. I know, but it's dark already and now I definitely think we should go to the police. Fine. Lemme take this out and clean up. I'm gonna just drive my car down to the street real quick and see if I can get reception. Maybe this time he'll answer. All right,. Finally, a signal. Jesus Christ. What's up, y'all? Dom, where the fuck are you? We've been lookin' for you for hours. This shit isn't funny! I hope you're okay. Just call me back and let me know that you're okay so I can stop worrying. What's up, y'all? I know it's been a while since you've seen me, but I have been stuck up here in Ojai for the last couple days. This motherfucker. Dominic, what the fuck? Dom, Dominic! Dom! What the hell, Dom? Dom! Dominic, Dom! Dom, what the hell? Dom, what are you doing in here? Dominic! All right, we are all done. We can get outta here. What's taking your boy so long? I don't know. Let's just finish loadin' the car and drive down there. This is bullshit. Make sure you guys bring everything you need. The fuck?! Go, get inside! What the fuck is that? Call the police, Marcus. Shit! I don't have reception, remember? What happened to Phillip? Should've just run straight to the car. Can't believe this shit. What are we gonna do? We got to get outta here! No, no, no, no. Somebody's out there! Yeah it looks like a deserted car, but it's in the middle of the road in front of the Springcrest residence. Go find out if it's their car. If not, tell them we're gonna have to report it if it's in the middle of the road. Man, you know I don't mess with that house. It's Rashad. We have to make a run for it, you guys. It's our only hope of gettin' out of here. I don't know. How do we know that's Rashad? Are you kiddin' me? He told us earlier that he'd be on patrol. We have to go now before he leaves. All right, let's just leave it here tonight. If it's still here in the morning, we'll tow it then. Come on, man. Are you serious? You're really scared of that house? Yeah, I ain't goin' up there. It's dark as hell right now too. Rashad, this is your job. This is what you get paid to do. I suggest you do it if you wanna stay employed. Copy that. I'm goin' now. Man, hell no! That's a long run, Grace. I don't know if we could make it. You know what, Marcus? I'm no longer listenin' to the shit you have to say. You're the reason why we're even in this mess and every time I follow your lead, you take us to some bullshit. I'm tryin' to keep you safe. Listen to me! No, I'm not doing anything you say because you fuck everything up. I'm gonna run to Rashad and have him take me to the police. You guys can stay here if you want. Fuck! Grace, no! Leah wait, I'll bring her back! Rashad! Rashad! Rashad, you got to take us to the police! Grace! Leah. Leah, open the door! Leah, open the door! Leah, please! Open the door! Leah, Leah. Not here. Open the door! Leah. What the fuck, Leah? Open the door! Leah, open the door! Fuck, Leah! Open the door! Come on, Leah. Help with this table. Fuck. Get the fuck outta here! What was that? We got to get the fuck outta here or we gonna die. Where's Grace? She's dead, Leah. Motherfucker killed her. What do you mean? What happened out there? He killed Grace. He killed Phil. He killed everyone. No. We got to figure somethin' out. No no no. If he comes in here, we have to fight his ass. What? No, no! Fuck, get over here! Fucker!
