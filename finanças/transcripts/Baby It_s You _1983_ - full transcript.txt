They say, "You'll never get another woman "to look at you." Oh, sure. In the play, they castrate him. You're making that up. So how did he look? He had a cut on his face. Big deal. He's still gorgeous. Hi. Hi. I think I'm gonna pee in my pants. Do you know him? I never did before. I think he's so cute. If it wasn't for his name. Jack and Jill. (ALL LAUGHING) Do you know him?

We can learn from the most unlikely sources, which is why I continue to bother calling on Jill. Okay. Monarchy, oligarchy, democracy, plutocracy, anarchy, meritocracy... I think about him all the time. I dream about him. I dream about being near him for the rest of my life. I dream of having children that look like him. I wouldn't be an actress all the time, only until I found him and fell in love with him. After that... After that, we'd take a train and go to the beautiful cities and see the wonderful people everywhere. And whenever people were sick, he'd go to them and make them well again. That's enough. Very nice, Jill. I'm sorry. I went off the wrong track. I'm sorry. An actor never apologizes for an audition, dear. Next, please. Got the mail already? MR. ROSEN: Hiya. Hi. Anything for me? Nope.

You can't act on a full stomach. You're quoting Stanislavski or Audrey Hepburn? MR. ROSEN: A body cannot function properly on a diet of tomato pies. You need protein! You need fiber. You need complex carbohydrates. When do you find out? JILL: Tomorrow. MR. ROSEN: What's the play? The Time of your Life. I wanna do Kitty. There must be other parts besides Kitty.

Something or other. No. Christ! He looks like he should be selling used cars. Or stealing them. This macaroni looks like it's been left over from last year. Do you think I'm too skinny?

And number two, The corresponding sides must be proportional. Also, since the definition is reversible, if two polygons... (BELL RINGS) Hey, congratulations. I'm going to pretend you're not there.

I heard a rather distressing rumor in the faculty lounge the other day about you and some young man. About me? I've seen many a promising young actress betray her talent for the sake of a few careless adventures. Yes, Miss Vernon. A theater professional is dedicated to the pursuit of excellence. If you strive for anything less than excellence, you're cheating the people who come to see you perform and betraying your own talent. Yes, Miss Vernon. (ITALIAN FILM DIALOGUE) Don't. What?

I told her you had too much sense for that to be a problem. Mom, just do me a favor, all right? Just stay out of my personal life. She's got a personal life. What's wrong with that? I thought you lit up the stage. That does it. Of course, it would be great to go somewhere where it's warm.

They write each other. Every day. A bit of a wimp. So what about you? You leave anybody behind? No. Nobody? Well, there was this insane character in high school. He was really a greaser. Almost...

(JILL RETCHES) JILL: Help! You okay? Miss, we seem to have a slight problem. (JILL RETCHES VIOLENTLY) I don't think I have anything left. I did it on the train, too. Well, just in case. Would you dial this for me? Sure. Yeah, I'd like to call 305-866-5050, please. Ask for Albert. Mm-hm. (COINS JINGLE) Yeah, is Albert there? They are getting him. Thanks. Call out if you need any help. Okay. Sorry I woke you. No problem. (EXHALES) Sheik? Hi. It's Jill. Yeah, I'm in the dorm. I called your house and I talked to your mother. She gave it to me. Think I woke her up. What is it? A restaurant or something? No, no. It's a club. I'm doing my act here. Yeah, I'm singing. Yeah. So, uh... What are you doing? I've been sort of bummed out. It's different here. Um, there's a lot of pressure. I don't know how you are supposed to act. No. Only for this girl Shelly. And no one likes her either. So, you thinking of dropping out? No, no... No. I was thinking of coming down to Miami, though. I got a friend down there. Remember Beth Liebo? And there's this guy Bill, whose family is in the toy business. Zelmire Toys. Yeah, Leonard. His family is the Golden Meat Company. Beef by-products. How are your classes? Classes? They're not real high on the list down here. Oh. Anyhow, who we're meeting now is this guy Curtis who's very sweet and is bringing someone for you. What do you think about that, Lew? A whole school full of horny women. (LAUGHING) CURTIS: I had a cousin who went there once. She was a freedom rider, back when they had those. But she was always weird. Who wants to go in the water? CURTIS: I think I'm ready for another brew. Listen, there's some bills in my wallet. Why don't you get us another six? Okay. I'll go with you. CURTIS: And get some smokes, too, okay? Okay. Listen, if we are not here when you get back it means we met a couple of hot ones and took them down to the grove. (BOTH CHUCKLE) I was wondering if you'd be up to go see Sheik tonight? He's down here? Yeah. What's he doing? Running a kidnapping service? He is performing. He's got a nightclub act. If you really think that you want to see him. We could just take a peek and not let him know. If it's too awful... What about Lew? We'll drown him. That's Curtis's Eldorado. Where do you meet all these guys? Through the sorority. You still in? Sororities aren't real high on the list up there.

The chairman of the board, ladies and gentlemen. And now another request. Arthur, J-12. This is for all you ladies who keep the home fires burning. A one, a two, a one, two, three and... ( WIVES AND LOVERS BY JACK JONES PLAYS) JACK JONES: ♪ Hey, little girl ♪ Comb your hair, fix your makeup ♪ Soon he will open the door ♪ Don't think because there's a ring ♪ On your finger ♪ You needn't try anymore ♪ SHEIK: You order anything you want, okay? It's pretty expensive. Hey, you go to the Fountainebleu, you go first class, huh? That's the point. Anything you want. Thanks. Isn't this fantastic? Miami Beach is the greatest place in the world. I think back on Trenton sometimes. It's like years I spent in prison. You like it? What, are you kidding? The people you see down here. I've seen women, their hands never been near dishwater. Till they're 20 years old. They go to these debutante parties. Look for a husband. They have a big wedding. And then for the rest of their life they go shopping. So, are you seeing anybody? Not really. How about you? Not really. So, how's your singing career? Que sera, sera. You know? I just need the right break. Are you working on your voice? Voice? Voice is not that important. I mean, you look at a guy like Dino, okay? You look at the clothes, you look at the style. Voice is not the whole story. You ever been to a place like this? My parents used to bring me here when I was little. No kidding. Well, next time, some of the things I got working for me, they come through, we'll book a room here. Nothing but the best. (STAMPS FLOOR) It's the mice. Got to let them know you're home. You want some coffee or something? I got my own kitchen here. No, thanks. Like the tux? It's nice. It's custom-tailored. I had it made. Where did you get all these pictures? Remember that little squirt that took pictures for the yearbook? I sort of bought the negatives off him. Does it pay pretty well at the nightclub? Monday through Friday, I wash dishes. Then on the weekends they let me do the act. People seem to go for it. That's how Jerry Lewis got his start. Lip-syncing records. Oh. I haven't decided though, whether to bill myself as just the Sheik, or...I don't know, use another name. You never told me why people started calling you that. It's a kind of protection. A what? A kind of rubber. You know, Trojans, Ramses, Sheik. Speaking of which, are you on anything? Are you on the pill or something? Oh. No. Well, I got that covered. Turn the light off. Don't take any shit up there. I don't even know why you're going back. I got to work some things out. You ask me, it's a waste of time. (BOARDING ANNOUNCEMENT) I should go. I'm going to call. So will I. I'm going to write, too. So will I. I love you. I know. ( VENUS IN FURS PLAYS) GIRL: So anyways, I figured it was okay, getting it on with my English Lit tutor because he wasn't married. What's that got to do with it? I don't know. Get good grades? A's. But I earned them. Bet you did. (ALL CHUCKLING) Couldn't have gotten away with that for long in high school. JILL: I used to go out with this greaser. (ALL CHUCKLING) GIRL 2: Leather jacket! JILL: He was a small-time hood, right? Wanted to be the next Frank Sinatra. (ALL LAUGHING) (GIRL LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY) GIRL 3: Cheer up, Shelly. GIRL 4: So, what was this guy? Polish? JILL: Italian. (LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY) His name was Sheik, like the prophylactic. GIRL 4: Sheik? (LAUGHING) And he was crazy about me. He followed me round, called me up. Once him and his friend Rat kidnapped me. LESLIE: We've heard this number before, Rosen. JILL: Such a fuckin' loser. They borrowed the car and had to have it back by midnight. (ALL LAUGHING) Did you use to get it on with him in cars? GIRL 2: I'm gonna make it with somebody named Sheik. All Rosen does in cars is boot on the upholstery. SHELLY: Somebody change that record, please. I'm scared. LESLIE: Of the record? It freaks me out. LESLIE: Never smoke dope with amateurs. GIRL: Think we could make a food run? (OVERLAPPING CHATTER) I don't think I can make it. GIRL 2: Come on, Jill. Maybe we'll meet some bikers for you at Dunkin' Donuts. (KNOCKING) Hey. Steve. A bunch of the guys, we were road tripping. I tried to think of who I knew on campus. Like to come in? Sure. May be small, but it's ugly. You look different. I'm not throwing up. (CHUCKLES) You were pretty sick. I don't remember a whole lot of that night, just that it was a mess. I've seen worse. Do you smoke? Sure. So, what do you do when you road trip? Well, Phillip went to see if he could find Leslie. The other guys went to the library to see if they could pick anybody up. Good luck. Philip says you're an actress. That's the rumor. So, you want to stay the night? Sure. (CHUCKLES) (CHUCKLES) Phillip's driving down right after his poli sci exam. He'll be pretty wiped but he'll get here. Chrissy's got this guy who's flying down from Harvard then taking the train. JILL: Christ. Karen's got this dude from Columbia, but he's okay. Shelly's guy from high school is coming. She wouldn't dare. He's in love with her. That's what psychotherapy is for. Bet they still jerk each other off. (SCOFFS) 8-Ball. You can't beat me, Rosen. What'd I tell you? Speed kills. What about you? Steve's coming. Oh yeah? Good. I was worried about you. Why is it such a big deal? It always was and always will be. Off the cushion. Thanks. Hello? Sheik? What's wrong? Nothing is wrong. No. Did I wake you up? Of course you woke me up. It's 2:00. I'm sorry. I just had to talk to you, that's all. Oh, things are coming along, you know? A lot of things are gonna happen for me soon. I can feel it, you know? I'm really tired. Can I call you tomorrow night or something? Well, I'm out of the dorm a lot. All right. Will you write me? Yeah, I will. All right. Goodnight, Jill. You waiting for a call? From Boston. Sorry about that. I'm so mad! I mean, he just does these things! I can't control... Is it exciting? Sort of. That is something you can use. That sense of excitement that goes with fear. But he's such an asshole! And he's fucking kidnapping me! Is that all that you feel? You Albert? They call me Sheik. I was told to see Albert. I'm him, too. You're supposed to fix me up. Oh, you bussing? Am I what? You bussing? No, no. I'm singing. Singing? Yeah, I'm the new singer. Vinnie Franco. I don't get it. What don't you get? They said you were going to run a microphone check for me. You mean, you really sing? Now, I move my lips and they play the fucking jukebox. Does this work? They wanted real singing, why didn't they ask me first? Why didn't they give me a shot? I figured this would be a toilet, but this is ridiculous. You're a real singer, huh? How come I never heard of you? If I had a voice, would I be working in a place like this? (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) It's not like it's the senior prom or anything. I just thought... Yeah, I know. I can get somebody else to go with me. Sure. Okay, give me a call sometime, all right? Have a nice flight. Okay. Bye-bye. Shit. I don't know what I'm going to do. You were talking on the telephone. Mmm-hmm. That must have been interesting. Remember I told you about Steve? That was him on the phone. Rick isn't coming either. I called him and told him Shelly died. They buried her behind the biology lab. It was beautiful. You know Jill Rosen? Do you know Jill Rosen? You know Jill Rosen? Yeah. Where's Jill? Where's Jill? What are you doing here? I came to see you. Sheik... You didn't write. I know. I'm sorry. It doesn't matter. I'm here. All my stuff. I got to talk to you. I think about you all the time. What do you mean? I want you. Sheik... Damn it! You shut up and you listen! You never give me an inch! Not in high school, not ever! And we're good together! I know that! And all the rest, all the college, all the jobs, all the bullshit, it doesn't mean shit! Just you and me, that's what's important! I'm not in love with you. Why not? It just doesn't work for me. What the fuck does that mean, huh? You don't even give me a chance! It's because of who I am, right? Don't hand me that shit! Don't hand me that shit! On account of what I'm gonna end up, right? Right? You've got your singing. Oh, bullshit! I ain't... I ain't ever going to be anything! I'm gonna end up a fucking garbage man like my father! That's not true. Don't fuckin' talk down to me! Sheik... Don't you look at me. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I do love you, you know. Just not the way you want me to. I got some feeling in this, too. I'm trying to be somebody up here and I'm a complete washout! Hiding in my room all night because some guy won't go to a dance with me. You think I've got it made or something? You lied to me. I didn't want to hurt your feelings. What about when you came to Miami, huh? What the fuck was that? What do you want from me? You want me to quit school and get married to you and have kids? What the fuck is so awful about that? That's not who I want to be! I don't know what I want, but it's not that! When we were in high school... We're not in high school anymore! You don't want to see me anymore? No. You shouldn't have slept with Jody. Yeah, that was stupid. (JILL SNIFFLES, SIGHS) So, what are you going to do now? I don't know. (KNOCKING) LESLIE: Jill? You in there, Jill? BOY: We should get a move on. LESLIE: Maybe she crapped out and took the train home already. (GROANS) Is this dance a big deal or something? Everybody tries to impress each other with what guy they can get to go to it with them. And you got stood up? Shot down. Fucking guy is an asshole. You could take me to it. I can't have everybody thinking I'm a cootie sitting alone in my room. You don't want to go in there with me. Yes, I do. What they going to think? You walk in there with some meatball? There gonna think I've got the best-looking guy in the whole place. I seen some of these guys when I was looking for you. They dress like shit. You must've terrorized the place. (LAUGHS) Yeah, I did. So, how about it? You gonna bail me out? (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) Ladies and gentlemen, we just got a weird request. But we're gonna do it anyway.
