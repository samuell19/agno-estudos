Shall l tear it up? Yes, tear it up, do. l'll tear it up, l promise. You brought me luck. l was losing. Why did you keep looking at me? Are you annoyed? No, but why keep looking at me? Was it so noticeable? l asked you why. Why? You're a girl. You're pretty. And l like pretty girls. You'll take me for an ogre. May l? Why? Because you're an ogre. Go along. Take the wheel. Not frightened of being with an ogre? Not a bit. Suppose l tried to... kiss you... What'd you do? Put you in your place. And if l used force? l'd fight. Let's go on. You shouldn't have... Why not? After what l said. Why? lt puts me at a disadvantage. Don't be so proud! Coming, idiot? l've torn my pants. What do you do? l draw does. Does? Yes, does. lt's too long to explain. l'd rather be kissed. Very well! Wait, l'll tell you why. Two guys, Rob?que and Riais are following us. Disappointment for them. l'm broke. l'm not joking. They were playing poker at Fr?d?rique's. She asked them to. She told you so? l just guessed it. But why should she? No particular reason. She's bored. lt amuses her to know what l do. She'll be happy. Happy l kissed you? Of course. You've a great sense of friendship. Oh, the dirty bitch! Shall l make a fire? A pity. There'd have been a justification for the fire and the music... and the whisky l'll offer you. What justification? Making love to you... Make yourself comfortable. Do you know why we were followed? l don't give a damn. l must tell you something. Tell me. No, l don't want to. Tell me. Why not? No, it'd be silly. And it doesn't matter. Tell me anyhow. Please don't insist. Tell me. Can l see you? She's back? She's at his place. l must say she only put up a slight resistance. First he took her round the citadel. We couldn't hear... but l suppose it was the usual. She played it cool at first. But finally she must have been overcome by his patter. The two of them looked very... touching. A romantic ballad... an idyll. A petting party... Think it funny? Damned funny! What do girls think of? You can go now. A slight formality. My check. You lout! The laborer's worthy of his hire. Night, sweetheart. Go and buy some new pants. Glad you noticed. Hallo, darling. Know where l've been? With a man. You don't ask if l love him. Do you? l don't know. l think not. And you don't ask... what l did. l can guess that easy enough. Want some tea? - Yes please. Drink from my cup... if you don't mind too much. Not too much. Bread? So... what's the young man's name? Paul Thomas. Not the architect? You know perfectly well. He seems all right. l hardly know him. l hope you'll be happy. That's all l want. How nice of you to call. l'm not disturbing you, am l? Not at all. l came to see what you do. You weren't too bored last night? No, it was a very pleasant evening. Three hours of poker... a bit boring, eh? The faces of your friends were funny. Let's go over there. You like that? An ingenious idea! Yes, very much. Should be finished in two months. An amusing idea. Houses all the same... but all different. Anyhow, it's cheap. You seem happy. l am. l'm happy that you're happy. Let's drink to that. Terrific! You really know what's what in comfort. To your very good health. You like that girl? What girl? Don't be a hypocrite. Why. Who? You know quite well who l mean. The girl who's living with me. Couldn't keep your eyes off her. Her name's Why? l didn't know. You didn't ask her? l must have forgotten to. You don't love her? l don't know. Why should l? But you slept... spent the night with her. Oh yes? You're trembling. - Not at all. Yes you are. l'm not. Another drink? What's the time? Ten past three. l had a date with your prot?g? at three. l'd quite forgotten. Your turn, sweetie! Not many people here. lt's Saturday. l think... l've drunk too much. Can't you stand it? Yes... But l'm a little tired. What's up? Why not go to your date? Think l ought to? She'll be hurt. Not so much as if l dropped her in three or four weeks. Want to give me to her? l must go home. l feel as if... my cheeks are burning... This bed's not been used! No, don't touch me... Yes, touch me. Kiss me. You know Paul Thomas? - Yes. Seen him today? - Not today. lf you see him, ask him to call me. Okay! Come in, sweet child, and have tea with us. We're playing animal noises. You know it? l make a noise... you have to guess what. Like this... A dog. A sheep... Understand? Your turn. Listen! Now what's this? l'll begin again. A wolf. Yes. Your turn. l know. Well, Why? A hyena! Your turn, Why. Just do any animal... a snake, a pig Dear little Why... What's that? Do you know, Albert? No, do it again. lt wouldn't be a crocodile? Of course. You're right! A crocodile! Visitors! Ah, there you are! l'm sorry l didn't turn up for our date. Not annoyed? No, why should l be? Let's stop play-acting. Listen! l'm going to Paris with Paul. How about that! Shut up, you two! You must hate me for it. You don't know me. l'm sorry, Why... it's all my fault. Please understand... l'm trying something out... You have to read between the lines What lines? l want you to understand... and then forgive me... Can l stay? Of course. l realize that... l'm very selfish. Forget it. l'll wait for you here. We'll look after her. Behave yourselves, you two. Sex! We'd rather stuff ourselves. Come and eat! Where is the kid? lt'll be uneatable. l used sea water. An asado is moistened with sea water! Know what an asado is? ln the South American pampas... the 100-m.p.h. wind... throws burning coals on meat like this. We've a grill. Silence! Go back to your kitchen! Tell me if it's good or not. lt's very good. ''lf you see an animal, come for shelter. ''lt's probably a man.'' A Finnish proverb... ''Girls are nice, why are there nasty women?'' Meaning? ''A baker shouldn't be a butter-head.'' Understand his proverbs? ''The devil had no goat... yet he sold all sorts of cheese. Red, white and blue...'' ldiotic! At home with a fire and a full stomach is better than begging out of doors, eh? Yes. She's spoken! My little ones! We thought you were dead. How sad! My nightingale. How are you, darling? She's been nasty to us. Jealous! But we said... That you made money and weren't afraid of men. Don't listen. They're hateful. You're not dressed. Headache still? Just a bit tired. So l lay down. Here's your dessert. lt'll turn your head. They've drowned it in kirsch. Oh, those two! Let's talk. Go on. Don't interrupt me because... it's a complicated story. Paul and l... l'm listening. Don't keep interrupting. The little affair... the two of you had... wasn't really... very serious, was it? What happened to me... was terrific! l don't easily fall for a man... but with Paul... When l suggested... going with him to Paris... he said yes immediately. Of course. What man wouldn't? Not angry? Not at all. l was afraid you'd be. Nonsense! Don't be silly. l'm very pleased. lt was lovely in Paris. We went for long walks... and to the Louvre... He took me to his sites. He loves his job. He gave me books on architecture. He's charming with me. He's funny, you know. l like being with him. At first l thought... But an odd thing happened. You're in love. l must be mad! And him? Yes, he is too... or so he says. But it must be true. When l suggested he live here, he said yes. He'll live here? Think it's silly? Not at all. lt's wonderful for you. lt's the best thing in life. There's nothing silly about it. l am so happy... Sure you're not angry? On the contrary. l'll go back downstairs. How they annoy me! They annoy me! Who do? Those two... the lovers... Look at them. No time. Holding hands... and whispering At their age! l can't stand him. He's after her money. Look who's talking... Tell me what you think. lt's shit. Anyhow... Everything is shit. l'm cold all of a sudden. Aren't you? Want to go in? l'll get your shawl. Where is it? ln the cupboard. My dear little Why. Would you get me a glass of water? You're lovely. Very much on form now. What's up? My face needed doing up. You look odd. Well, so do you. Fr?d?rique lends me everything... whenever l want. Using other people's things... is like changing your skin. l don't see that. Because you're a man. Because you're a man... She lends me her things. Does that surprise you? Nothing surprises me in this house. What's the matter? Nothing. How long have you known Why? l thought l'd told you. A month and a half. And the two fairies? That's lost in the mists of time. Why do you ask? l think they hate me. There's something morbid about this house. l think you're exaggerating a little. l can't say l adore them. Shall l send them back to Paris? Let's not go as far as that. Can we talk a moment? What do you want? - We'll be quieter in there. Are you... happy here now? Why? Fr?d?rique's quite... mad over that dirty beast. So what? You don't think you can do anything but l'm a revolutionary. l take action. l'm fine as things are. Don't try to teach your grandmother to suck eggs. Are you happy? Leave me alone! Stupid bitch! l want to talk to you. That should have been done long ago But why did he ask you that? They're jealous of our happiness. Are you happy with us? They think Paul has changed their lives. Bastards! Cheer up! Till tonight. What's up? Someone's put something in it. - lndeed. Get out! l've had enough of you. Get out! We did nothing. Leave immediately. l want you out of this house. Explain, darling. We didn't do it. Get out, l say! Must l use other methods? Let's not argue. Come along. Can't even defend ourselves. What is all this from a cosmic standpoint? Why not ask the cook? Get out! We haven't a penny... lt's not enough even for second class. And a taxi to the station. And dinner on the train... 600 miles without food. Well, we don't hold it against you. So long, darling. Till next time. - Come on. Breakfast is ready. What did you say? Breakfast is ready. Up already? - For 2 hours. l've been for a walk. And l've made breakfast. l've picked flowers for you. l'm beginning to live again since they left. l feel rather guilty. Enough of them was as good as a feast. Collecting types like that... Darling, would you... go and get some butter? Till this evening, darling. Drinking on your own? - l like cognac. No criticism. Give us a drink. Let's get drunk. Shall we, Why? Yes, why not? l always have good ideas. Put on a record. Why, give us some music. A man wanted to discover wisdom. He read all the books, but he didn't find it. So they told him to go to lndia. So he saved up and went to lndia but when he got there, nobody knew But they said that up in the mountains there lived an old sage who knew what wisdom was. So he went to the mountains and walked He climbed... He climbed for months... and at last he found the sage. He said to him... Good morning, sir. They say you know all the truth about Existence. No, human wisdom... No, the sense... What was l saying? Darling, change the record... Well, then... the sage said he didn't... Listen! The sage didn't know. He said: Come back in 40 years and l'll tell you. But there's an older man than me. He'll tell you. So the man walked on for months to see the older man. And said: Sir, what is wisdom? And the old man... the old sage 1 10 years old... He said Human wisdom is a river... And he said... he... he said And the man said: l've walked for months and all you say is wisdom is a river. And the sage said... Wait a bit... Don't be a pessimist. l'm not a pessimist. l don't give a damn! Let's go to bed. You're both lovely... my darling does. Coming? Why did we get drunk? Just to drink. l love you both so. Dear Why We didn't want to wake you Paul has to go to Paris on urgent business. l'm going with him, of course. We'll be away a day or two. The house is yours. Try not to get bored. There's money in the drawer. Kisses from us both... l'm going with him, of course. Try not to get bored. Try not to get bored. Kisses from us both. There's money in the drawer. Kisses from us both. The house is yours. We didn't want to wake you Paul has to go l'm going with him, of course. l'm going with him, of course. We'll be away a day or two. There's money in the drawer. Kisses from us both. l want a taxi... Villa La Rebijoye. You're leaving? Yes. Goodbye, Violette. Thanks. When will you be back? Never. Why did you come? l was bored alone. Alone in that empty house. l need people. l'm cold. Awful things would have happened there if l'd stayed. What things? l don't know. Never heard shouts? What kind of shouts? ln your head. People quarrelling. lt may be in my head. Who knows... Sometimes they sing... and insult one another endlessly. They don't talk to you... But when they do, it's worse. They shout louder. What do they say? They've nothing against me. They just shout, that's all. They're tired of shouting at each other. They want someone else. As luck would have it, they choose you. l won't go back there. l'll stay with you. With you and Paul. Keep me with you. Oh, it's you. Of course l was waiting for you lmmediately? Very good. Of course l don't mind. Me too. l'm dining with him... Hurry! He's waiting. l've finished. l can't go on as l was before. l can't live without them. Who's them? You and Paul. Get out! l loved you both so much. You're frightful... You're disgusting! Why? Your love disgusts me. Can't you see you're not wanted? Goodbye to you. What shall l do? l'd like to throw someone out. l'm fed up too. Not easy to leave now... Now that l'm used to it. Why are you angry, Fr?d?rique? Because l love you? Because l love you or because l love Paul? You're all l've known. Why hold my happiness against me? My meeting you and loving Paul. l'll go. Don't worry. l'll go immediately. You'll never see me again since that's what you want. Don't be afraid... And now, Fr?d?rique, l can tell you Have you noticed we look like one another? The same skin. The same hair. The same mouth. The same expression, sometimes. The same tastes. How should l not love you... and love Paul? As you yourself... Paul, my love. No, l've changed my mind. You come here. We'll dine in our room. No, l'm not mad. l want to be alone with you. No, l'm not mad. l want to be with you... all alone.
