Bravo. Bravo. Young man, that was a beautiful melody, why haven't I heard it before? Because my dear friend I only wrote it last night. - Well, it was very good. - Good? It was magnificent. You owe 8.50 Francs for the wine. Our bargain was one concert for one dinner without wine. Our bargain my dear sir, was music in exchange for indigestion. We have both fulfilled our contract. You are not going until you pay me 8 francs 50 centimes. The man is money mad. If you don't pay for the wine I send for the police. Very well, have them arrest me for eating your horse meat. Pig. I served you chicken, breast, wing... - chicken. - Horse meat. You won't pay for the wine and insulted my food, will you? Give me back my music, you horse killer. Joseph, here. - How do you do? - This cab is occupied. Beautiful. - Driver, driver. - Allow me. - You see. - I see. - He congratulates you, he approves. - He would, an idiot. But romantic. - Driver, driver, take me to the Pension... - La Tour. - La Fitte. - Thank you. Thank you. I just wanted to know where you live. Oh, very clever. But you won't like the La Fitte Miss Sheridan. - Oh, so you can read. - Six languages. But the language of love is universal. Lovely name Shirley, mine is Victor Florescu. Very interesting. Pension La Fitte. Oh but Ms. Sheridan, it's a terrible hole that La Fitte. Now, the La Tour is the finest Pension in Brussels. Clean, comfortable, congenial people. I live there myself. Oh, how interesting. Pension La Fitte. The roof leaks, the coffee is chicory. - I love chicory, La Fitte. - La Tour, there are insects. - La Fitte. - La Tour. - La Fitte. - La Tour. La Fitte. Pension La Tour, Pension La Fitte. Do you hear that trio? 12 hours a day, that's what you'll have to put up with if you move into the La Fitte. They are deaf and dumb, they play only for the exercise. 12 Francs. Oh no, allow me. - I will not allow you. - But I insist, you're my guest. 12 Francs. - Will you go away? - Miss Sheridan, everything I have is yours. Say the word and I'll buy the cab for you. - You want to buy my Teresa? - If the lady wishes. The lady wishes she never seen you. You make a big a mistake, 102 horsepower, strong, And look at the seat, real leather and the horn.. - Here, can you resist that horn? - Easily. Miss Sheridan, every morning you and I'll ride Teresa through the park. The sun will shine, the birds will sing, the flowers will dance. And I'll yell for the police. - Oh Miss Sheridan. - I think I'll start yelling now, let go. You ruined everything, get out of the way, for heaven's sake. Bring the rest of my things to La Fitte, will you? I'll pay you there. I'm taking the young lady's things upstairs. So, there are insects in my house and the roof leaks. The lady says that's your tip. You want to buy my Teresa, my beautiful Teresa? You may as well note now my friend, I can't buy your Teresa, I can't even pay your fare. - I haven't a suit. - Oh, no? What you going to do? - The young lady will pay. - You don't want to do that. - I want my 12 Franc. - Look here... Take anything I got, but please, for the love of heaven, don't ring that bell. - You are in love? - Terribly. - What you got to pay? - My hat? - My coat? - It's not worth 3 Francs. - My shoes? - They won't fit me. My trousers? They crease in the front. I like mine to crease on the side. What's this? - My portfolio, but I carry my music in it. - I carry my lunch in it. - Wait, wait, I just want my music. - No, no, no. - Idiot, my songs are no use to you. - I give them back for 12 Franc. - Why you, you. - No, no, no. That's not true, my mother, she was a lady. But how will I ever find you again? Nobody is got a horn like my Teresa. But where will you be? I can't go listening all over Brussels. Well, in the evening I am generally at the fountain of the Brussels Ball. On the left side of the street, opposite cafe of the Dead Rat. You'll surely be there? Nothing in life is sure. Sometime I'm in the park, sometime I'm at the station. Maybe I go back to Italy, who knows? I am a philosopher. - But how I'll have my music? - You get 12 Francs, you find me.. Professor Bertier, this is an honor. Have you been waiting long? - Only an hour Victor. - I'll never forgive myself. My teacher comes so far to see me and I have an engagement. - So, I see. - Professor, I assure you... You don't deserve the good news I bring you. Good news? What would you say if I told you I've arranged for Daudet to hear your music? - Daudet? - He's coming at five to the Conservatoire. - Professor, I'm rich, I'm famous. - I'm not finished. - If he likes your music, if... - If he? - He'll commission you to write an operetta. - Oh, professor. Richard Strauss is already turning green with envy. - My operetta, my music in Paris. - Yeah, but it's 3:30 now. We, we just got time to order the arrangements. - You want me to play it for you? - Yes, where's your portfolio? - My portfolio. - Where's your music? You lost your music. - I? Why, professor... - Don't lie. It has something to do with that chemise business. - Oh professor, my word of honor. - Oh, what you going to play for Daudet? - Answer me. - My songs, don't I know my own music? No. Oh professor wait a minute. Here it ism here is the theme. - What theme? That isn't it. - I'll get it, I know I get it. Ah, here it is. That's enough, I don't know what you did with your music but you got to find it. I'll find it. - Daudet comes at five. - I'll be there with my music. You can throw away the biggest opportunity I can ever give you. - You can also break my heart. - Oh, professor. That's all. There, take it all. You butcher, you tin pan alley composer, you thief. For the love of heaven stop that noise. Stop it, stop it. Do you hear me? Do I hear you? I can hear you in Moscow. - Was it you who... - Operating a boiler factory, yes. Oh, it was beautiful. Such melody, such spirit. Such tin pan, such butchery, such boiler-works. - Anything else you can think of? - I? I haven't said a word. I have been sitting here in my studio, dreaming. And the dream was so beautiful, so real that when I woke up I found this. Well, it isn't mine. I bought it to give to my aunt. I came to return the property of your dear old aunt. - That's very kind of you. - It's in good order, undamaged. I'm happy. Darling. - Take my hand. - I've got it. This other hand too. Isn't this lovely? - Oh, you're impossible. - You saved my life, I forgive you. - Well, then, please go. - Through the window? No, the door. So, you permit me to enter here and only to kick me down to that other place. - Where you be more at home. - In that case, I choose the window. - I hope you break your neck darling. - Such passion, such fire. - Do you want me to call the concierge? - No, let's be alone. - Oh really, you're making me miserable. - Am I making you miserable? I'm sorry. Well then, go. And you'll remember me as the man who made you miserable. I'll go only if you say, Victor, I forgive you. Alright. Victor, I forgive you and now, will you go? - You forgive me Shirley? - Yes, yes. I forgive you. - We're friends? - Yes, yes, we're friends. - We're not friends. - Yes, we are. Now, will you please go. And from friendship to love only one little step. Shirley, we can no longer be friends. I adore you, I'm mad about you, I... Shirley, may I claim the privilege of a friend?

Music seems to do something to me. - You know why I like music? - No, why? I don't know, that's why I asked you. You know, it's a peculiar thing, some people like music and other people don't seem to like music. You said, you would kind enough say that you'll advance me the.. Oh, so I did, getting back to what we were talking about. Oh, yes, my late uncle. I became rich at a single stroke. - My uncle had it two days ago. - I don't know how to thank you? Of course I'm not really rich... I just have enough money now to get a harp and so I can play it. You shall, you shall play it for me someday. I'm certainly looking forward to that moment. And I shall always remember you as the man who saved my life. Not at all, I'm glad to have been of service. - The 12 Francs? - Oh, don't mention it. But you haven't given me the money. - I haven't? - You put it back in your pocket. - You sure you're not trying to hoodwink me. - I assure you. My uncle said I was very gullible. - For the love of heaven. - Oh, don't get excited, here. My music. Oh, here is my card. Come and see me soon. And thanks again for the 12 Francs. Not at all, hope I've a chance to do a favor for you sometime. When you are in Paris on the holiday professor, come and see me. I'm sorry but I'm sure something must've happened to him. Oh well, let's just forget the young man. You couldn't possibly wait just not a few minutes... - I know it's asking a great deal but... - No, no, no, no, professor. Au revoir. - Stupid. - Why you impertinent.. Why don't you look where you're going? - Victor, what have you done? - Oh, I have been delayed professor. - Has he been waiting long? - Why, you little pup. Are you still here? We mustn't keep him waiting. This is Monsieur Daudet. Oh, I'm charmed, I'm Victor Florescu. Yeah, I'll remember the name and the face. You're not going away without hearing my music. I shall deprive myself of that pleasure. Alright, I made an enemy today, I lost my career today but I don't care. I'm happy. Today, I found the most glorious girl in the whole world. I kissed her. What's a career? I tell you she smiled at me, she slapped me. I'll give all your music, all your art, all your success for one of her smiles. I'll give you money, fame, what do they mean to me? Today, I found love. - I'll listen to your music. - You will? Monsieur Daudet, thank you. Pardon, will you tell me where I can find professor Bertier? - Prof. Bertier, where can I find... - Sishhh. I won't sishh. He's coughing. - Who? - Daudet. - Daudet is coughing. - Daudet is coughing. Daudet is coughing. He's coughing again. Look out, look out. - He's coughing, professor? - Yes, yes, - It's a cold? - No. - He doesn't like it? - No, no, he's eaten some pretzels. - Pardon me, Professor Bertier? - Yes. - I'm Shirley Sheridan. - How do you do? - I've just arrived from New York. - And I hope you had a nice trip.

Now I know why I came to Brussels. Oh, but Monsieur Daudet, allow me to present Miss Sheridan, my fiance. - Your what? But I'm nothing of the sort. - It's alright for him to know. But I'm not your fiance, I'm no one's fiance. Bravo, let me congratulate you. It's delightful to find a beautiful young woman who is modern. What are you going to do about the opera? - Opera? - Yes, the operetta, my music. - Oh, yes. - You don't like it? - Do you? - I think it's superb. - He's a modest young man, isn't he? - I'm speaking of my music, not myself. I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll produce your operetta. - Victor. - Oh, professor. - And now, what can I do for you young lady? - For me? - Yes, what do you want most in life? - Me.

Oh yes, another music monger, eh? Seems me I'm always meeting these music mongers. Charmed. You, you know Pop Goes The Weasel? - Now, there's a song. - It's the only song he knows. - I know it, I can play it for you. - What instrument do you play? I play the harp, I brought it along for just such an emergency. Do you mean to tell me that you came here just to play that thing? I thought I'd get a little drunk too. I'm terribly sorry but he has absolutely no ear for music whatsoever. - Would you like to hear Pop Goes The Weasel? - Oh, thank you so much, some other time. Why not play your operetta for me? I want to go back to the stage. Why not come back in something you've already done? The Merry Widow for instance. I want to come back in something new. Have you changed your mind about that Pop Goes The Weasel? No, thank you. Well, in case you do just let me know, I'll be around. You will come, won't you? My dear lady, you are very charming, you got a glorious voice, you're the toast of Paris. It will be an honor to have you in any work of mine but... the opera isn't done, it's not finished. Thank you just the same. Now will you excuse me please. - Charming party. - Yes, isn't it? - Have you a light? - Yes. You made quite an impression on Odette. - Delighted. - Would you kindly hear me play the harp? No. - Allow me. - Oh, thank you. Yes, with Odette your operetta stands a great chance. If there were an operetta. Do you mean to tell me you haven't done any work? Do you mean to tell me you don't know it? - Well, that's too bad, what's wrong? - Laziness. No my boy, I know what's wrong. There are too many distractions here for you. Instead of furthering your own career you're absorbing Shirley's. May I ask why the sudden interest? - I'm fond of you Victor. - I never suspected that. - And I have great faith in your talent. - Nor that. - Very well, Il be frank. - That will be a relief. Shirley wants to drop everything and go back to a garret in Brussels... where the atmosphere pleases you. - Did she tell you that? - She's in her room packing right now. Packing? I can make Shirley an international figure. - But I'm in the way. - You are. - Very much. - Very much? You want her to give up all this to wash dishes? Oh, that would never do, she's not good at washing dishes, she breaks them. Do you want her to give up everything that a beautiful and... talented young woman is entitled to, just to wait on you, you understand what I mean? - Perfectly, you want me to give her up. - Well... - Are you going to let her wreck her career? - Why not? Other women have done more for love. Bon voyage monsieur, so sudden you're leaving. We are not going. - Going places? - Going Brussels. Pension La Fitte, Pension La Tour, and I'm taking my own umbrella too. Well, I'm afraid you won't like leaky roofs now after this. Nonsense, we'll find Teresa and that silly horn. How does it go? How does it go? Honk, honk, honk. - And that funny driver. - He was a bad salesman. - Oh, 102 horsepower, strong, eh? - And the seat, real leather. We'll make him drive us all over Brussels. I won't leave the station until you do find him. - But you said he was an idiot. - And you had said he was romantic. - Shirley. - Yes? Has it ever occurred to you that I might not want you to go with me? Don't say that Victor, not even in fun. - But in Brussels I'd still be your guest. - Oh no, you wouldn't. Victor... will you marry me? I'm afraid I would make a very bad husband. Have you ever been one? Then how you know? It's too monotonous, a man, an artist needs change, variety... - otherwise there is no inspiration. - I don't believe that. But, I'm not an artist, I'm a woman. That's why we look at things so differently. Now you want marriage, next you'll want a home, children. Of course. Can you imagine me, Victor Florescu with a family? - Boy, it's laughable. - I don't understand you. Oh Victor, don't let your pride come between us. Today happens to be my day. Tomorrow will be your success. - Why, doesn't matter who's lucky now. - But it isn't that. All my life I've loved and be loved. A lovely interlude, an experience but when it's over, it's over. Just, just something to remember the moment... - then on to a new one. - Why, yes. Have you, have you arranged for your new experience? I'll let it happen. I must look to my own success first. - Of course. - But, don't you see? Odette is thinking of backing my operetta. If I fancy, she'll do it. If not, well you know how women are. Oh yes, I'm learning fast. All new love becomes old Shirley. I've written a song about ours. - Song? - Would you like to hear it? Yes, I'd like to hear it. ♪ She brings you a new smile, for new lovers do smile ♪ ♪ She tempts you and you smile, a new love is told ♪ ♪ She brings you some new thrills, some tender and true thrills ♪ ♪ But after a few thrills ♪ ♪ Your new love is old ♪ ♪ If you're for me, then I'm for you, what more is there to say ♪ ♪ The rattle of the drum and the flute goes high. ♪ ♪ When you feel you got to share of the blues and black despair ♪ ♪ Just repeat this maiden's prayer ♪ ♪ Which means that you are all for me and I am all for you ♪ Start from the ballet and run through, ballerinas get ready. Charles, you can play your harp. Odette, mademoiselle Odette. Madame wants to see you in her dressing room right away. - What's happened? - Madame says it's very important. Come. Odette, this is our only chance to rehearse without interference. I know my part, is that all you can think of? - Yes. - How young you are. - I admire and respect your husband too much. - Your a liar. Odette, I like you tremendously but I don't love you. Who mentioned love? I was in love once. So I married Rudy, for security. But I deserve a little happiness now and then. But the show opens tomorrow night. Yes, the show opens tomorrow night thanks to me. Aren't you grateful? Of course I am, I'm tremendously grateful. I don't know how to thank you. That's evident. - Call for Odette. - Oh, alright. Help me up. If you don't, I won't get up. I mean it. - Why? - Because I'm in love with someone else. Is that enough? Oh. Come in, darling. Victor and I were rehearsing the love scene. Yes, I came back too soon. - But, I assure you. - I didn't want you to go back to the stage. - I know now I should've never permitted it. - Why darling, you're being absurd. An old man in love with a beautiful woman is always absurd. - My word of honor monsieur. - You're young, I'm not. You're attractive, I'm not. But I want to keep my wife. And I see now the only way I can do it is to keep her out of the theater. So you must decide what you want, the theater or your husband... - such as he is. - You're taking your wife out of the show? Show, that's finished. Odette, I'll be in the car. I'll wait five minutes, make your choice. I'm sorry Victor. We could've been very happy if you'd been discreet. - You can't go. - I don't want to. I'd like to sing again. How do I know I'd be a success? The public may have grown tired of me. May have forgotten me entirely. My husband is very kind to me. I need him. - The show means everything to me. - You're young, you'll have other shows. Goodbye Victor. - Mr. Florescu? - Yes. Monsieur Bertier tells me he's no longer connected with the production. Without his guarantee, I must've one week's rent of the theater in advance. - Ten thousand Francs. - But why? The show is going to be a success. Of course, every composer thinks his show is going to be a great success. - And yet, there are failures. - Bring me a blank check. - You have the money? - Of course. But you haven't got the ten thousand. If the show is a success the check will be good. If it isn't? If it isn't I can not go back to Shirley... If I can't go back to Shirley, I might as well be in jail. On what bank? - What bank would you like? - Oh, Bank Deno. - That's as good as any. - You sure this check is good? If it isn't, you know the law. Yes monsieur Florescu, I do. Don't like the way he said that. Attention, everybody. Attention, attention. My friends... it's written in the stars that The Cat And The Fiddle will be a great success. But I feel I must tell you that Mr. Bertier has withdrawn his support from the show. Nevertheless, we'll open as scheduled. I need your help. I want it. I know I'll have it. That's all. Thank you. - Just one little question. - Yes? Monsieur Bertier guaranteed us two weeks salary. Well, I'm in no position to do that. But I'll share my profits with you all. I can't gamble Victor, you know I've a wife and two children. - But... - Sorry. You'll stand by me. Well, nothing would give me greater pleasure than to stay with you here Victor. - I knew it. - But it isn't fair to the boys. Before I carry this lamp any further I want to know what all the rest of them think. I'll stay Victor, I don't mind no salary, just so I get it regularly. - I'll stay, Victor. - Thank you. I'll stay. Oh, thank you, thank you a thousand times. Everybody dismissed, back at 8 o'clock. Eight o' clock, don't forget. Why so gloomy? Just thinking about that new pair of shoes that I'm not going to get. I'm not worried. - I know, they're for my feet. - Forget it, this is Paris. Look. No shoes today, Rolls-Royces tomorrow. Say, who was it that said that? No shoes today Rolls-Royces tomorrow. Oh, it was you, wasn't? This show is going to be a great success. And when it is, I can go back to Shirley. A newspaper a day keeps the shoemaker away, that was me that said that. Paris wont let us stay but we must work fast. There's something you ought to know. I know, we need a leading man and a leading woman. Well, I'll get the leading man and you get the leading woman. Go see every manager in town, here's the score. Go. Well, there's something else, there's something you got to know. Well, what is it Charles? An orchestra? I thought of that too. Professor Bertier and his students, they are my friends. Hello? I want the Conservatory of Music in Brussels. Oh, Charles will you please go and do what I tell you. Professor Bertier. What? A hundred Francs? Reverse the charges. - I'll call for you in an hour dear. - Alright. - Why, Charles. - Good afternoon Miss Shirley. Haven't seen you in a long time, won't you sit down. - We have to sit down quick or don't you? - I'm sorry. Tell me all about yourself? Are you married yet? - No, but I'm engaged. - Well, that's as good as been married. Oh, it's much better, I see you're moving. - Yes, I'm to be married tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Going to be very happy. - That means I can't play the harp. Why not? - You see I counted on you. - On me? I can't play the harp unless we have a show. We can't have a show without a leading woman. You know most of the score. - The Cat And The Fiddle. - There's only one new song. - Try To Forget. - I don't want to hear it. Take it away boys. But Miss Sheridan... Miss Sheridan, you got to do something about it. But it doesn't concern me. - I know you can't feel that way. - I do. Shirley, you don't want Victor to get into trouble. - He'll take care of himself. - No, he won't. No, he won't. He gave a bad check, he's going to jail. The producer walked out on him. He was desperate if he doesn't... Oh, I'm not interested. Miss Shirley, you got to listen to me. I tell you I'm not interested. Just a moment please. - It's a splendid book Miss Sheridan. - Yes, it must be. Probably the work of genius. - This is not a passenger elevator. - Don't you care to hear the new melody? No, thank you. Try to forger, it's a great title, don't you think? Marvelous. Couldn't write it while I was there. No, he couldn't, the lyrics are lovely too. Try to forget all that you've meant to me.

Monsieur Florescu tell me, have you an orchestra? - Do you have to do that? - That's good luck, Sir. - Have you a leading woman? - Carmine. - A leading man? - He's here. You? I couldn't find anyone half as good for the price. - More good luck? - Double good luck. - Victor. - Professor. - Victor. - How are you professor? - I knew you wouldn't fail me. - Victor. Victor. Why, everybody is here, I hope the Conservatory... Oh, we closed it and took the first train. - Did you get the score? - We sat up all night. - Copying the parts. - All night long. - Not so loud, not so loud. - There are people in the theater. - Did you get a leading lady? - I got one but I don't know how good she is. Please, hurry get ready, there's no time. - Come on. - Professor. Fifteen minutes. - Who? - The leading woman. - She's here? - Who is she? I'd quite a time persuading her. - Is she singing? - Just warming up. - Oh Victor, I'm happy tonight. - So am I. - Thirteen minutes. - Professor, you remember Ladia Ringle? Ladia Ringle? Of course, she was a star when I was a child, this height, she was lovely. That's very interesting. Oh, may I present Ladia Ringle. Mr. Florescu, professor Bertier. And Mr. Ringle. I understood the part was for a young girl. A love story, a romance. Oh, I've taken care of that, I've changed it all around. Instead of playing the part of a young girl she plays the part of your mother. What? Don't you get it? Mother love, it's a big novelty. Gentlemen, you're disappointed. I don't fit the part? I think she'll be sensational. You know, a boy's best friend is his mother. This is impossible. - But Victor... - Imbecile. I know she's old but she's got good references. The pretty ones couldn't sing, I played it with Shirley. Shirley? I told her you gave a bad check to get the show on. - I told her you'd go to jail. - Victor? I told her your life was at stake but she said she's going to marry Daudet tomorrow morning. It isn't true. That's what I tried to tell you yesterday when I saw it in the paper. Monsieur Florescu, it's 8:25, time for the overture. Victor, please. Forgive me professor, but you don't know how funny it is. - The joke is on me. - Monsieur Florescu... - No performance tonight. - No performance? You can't do that. You need at least two performances to make good the check you gave me. If you call the show off, I'll let the law take its course. - Very well, send me to jail, who cares? - Alright. Victor please, you can play two performances. The critics will hear your music or the managers will hear it. What for? I'll never write another note. You got to go on Victor, for me. - It's no use Professor, it's no use. - Use? My students spent their last pennies getting here and so did I. We've gambled everything on you. Are you going to desert us? Leave us here, stranded in Paris? No, Professor. Charles, you're the prompter. - I can't play the harp? - Not tonight. - Professor, start the overture. - Good. I'll have to take care of that. - Overture. - Come in. Oh, triple good luck. ♪ This is the day when the masses, they rally round for a look at the king ♪ Dance all you lads and you lasses, you know that laughter and song is the thing ♪ ♪ Come everyone to your classes ♪ I think you better come up to Mrs. Ringles dressing room. - Why what's the matter? - Think she has a sore throat. Sore throat? Whenever she has a sore throat it seems she gargles with rum. - Rum? - I think she swallowed a little the gargle. I'll see you later. I think she's dead. - I think she's drunk. - Dead drunk. I'm no good, I'm no longer beautiful. I'm a grandmother. Is that so? I didn't know that, congratulations. Well, that settles it. Bring down the curtain. - How about this check? - Just call for the police. Get the police. Wait. What's that? Can it be? - Wait a minute, you'll ruin the show. - - I don't care about the show. I do. It's Shirley. I don't care who, she's just sen from heaven. I had a little to do with it. ♪ But after a few thrills ♪ ♪ Our new love is old ♪ Shirley darling... How could I've ever believed, even for a moment... that you were going to marry someone else? - But I am, tomorrow. - Shirley... Shirley, don't say those things even in fun. I'm the one to do the walking out this time, after I've save you from jail. Shirley, please. - Slip my costume. - Shirley darling. When I hurt you, it was because I love you. - Oh, Monsieur Florescu... - Quickly, I got to change, the next scene. Oh, what do I care about the next scene, the next moment, anything. All that matters is that you are here and I'm here. And I am here. You look charming darling. You were marvelous sweetheart, wonderful. Perhaps I better explain you just why Shirley is here. Why? There's nothing to explain. You knew I needed you and you came. - She came because I insisted on it. - You insisted on it? You insisted that Shirley should come and save my operetta, my life? Of course, I didn't want Shirley to reproach herself. You'd be a ghost between us. Now, when she's rescued you, she can despise you. - Isn't that right darling? - Yes dear. - I don't believe it. - Five minutes Miss Sheridan. Five minutes? My costume? I have to change. - Justine, unhook it. - Just a minute darling. - My fiancee wishes to change. - I got to run over my lines. Will you go please? Of course you forget that Ms. Sheridan and I were, well... The situation with you is different Monsieur Daudet. Why you? We're going to to go over our lines together. I can hold the book. Please Jules, do you mind cueing me? Start with the interior of the castle. Go on, begin. The scene where the king makes me a countess. Something about the theater has gotten into my blood. It makes such interesting men. Will you begin please? You should know the lines of your own silly play. It isn't a silly play, and I don't know the lines. About those five minutes I mentioned. Well, there's just two of them left. Jules dear, please. Rudolph and his now lieutenant is greeted by the people and Annette. Oh Rudolph, I'm so glad you've come. I've great news for you darling. You're to be made a captain, you'll receive a captain's pay. Well, that's your cue Monsieur Florescu. I've heard the news. Oh Rudolph, and I wanted to be the first to tell you. And I want to be the first to tell you I can't accept. Can't accept? But... but what of our dreams, hopes and plans for the future when you'll be made a captain and we could get married? - For the day when I would... - Rudolph goes left away from Annette. For the day when I would earn a captain's pay and I would be promoted by my own efforts... not through your favor with the king. Everything I've done I've done for you. You have achieved something and I haven't. We can never be happy and the king knows it. Don't you see Shirley darling, that's how it was with us. I would've lost your respect, I would've lost your love. Just a minute, you're getting away from the play. I wouldn't be dependent on you, I know I hurt you. But I wanted to save our love. Curtain is up. That line is about as original as this silly play. Shirley. I won't let you give up your career for my sake. That's why I pretended I wanted to leave you but I was wrong. But you deserted her when she needed you. Oh, we would've been so much happier without success without anything but each other. - Miss Sheridan you just have a second. - Shirley, you must understand.
