I have won & lost matches But I was never scared of losing... ... now the fear is haunting me If something happens to me... ... I have the fear of losing you That fear... it's defeating me even before I enter the ring For me... my dream is important I don't need... you... or your love or anything Don't take any decision in haste... ... whatever it is, let's meet - No... ... if I see you again... ... I will get the feeling of wanting you Ok Bye How can I forget you, Arjun ... tell me Arjun... Good... good job You did it naturally, I liked it very much... ... let's work together, I will inform you After many years, I heard the applause and it's because of Meera I don't know why, Meera appeared to me as Goddess I don't know if it was love or something else... ... that's when I felt she is my right life partner Hey... you fool, you have failed in the audition called love Baby... Hm... He has no love for the girl he married... He wanted to marry the girl he loved... nothing wrong in it It's ok, please sit and talk Sir, what I did was wrong My desire for Meera was my big mistake Hm... - I have regrets for that Thanks Meera - Why? Had you not come into my life... ... I would have spent my life doing a job, I don't like hm... - No Meera... ...we should do the job we like Now, I won't let it go, I will try in the same field Arjun, you are a good actor. Try it out, you will get good opportunities Meera... - Hm... ... the scene you gave for audition was super... ... make a film on that subject, it will be a super hit That will not be possible Arjun Why? I tried to make a film on the subject about a year ago ... the shooting got stalled within ten days Stalled!? - Hm The producer asked me to cast his son and make the film I realized that he won't fit into my film on seeing him But, not wanting to lose the opportunity, I accepted it He did not perform well even a single day of shoot and... ... I am short tempered and used to scold him in front of others It hurt producer's ego and he stalled the film Forget him. You could try some other producer One could get a second chance in life... ... but cinema... Excuse me Meera... Meera... Meera... Meera... Don't lose confidence You will get an opportunity No Arjun... ... not just cinema... ... even in my life... my ambitions remain unfulfilled See you, bye Anu... Anu... ... there is nothing as you think... She... Anu, why did you slap me? You have not come to office and even your phone is switched off Having searched for you all over the town I came here... ... seeing you engrossed with some girl... ... seeing her off with hugging & caressing After seeing all this, do you expect me to canoodle you and not slap you? Anu, don't talk rubbish There is nothing between both of you, right? If so, call her right away and address her as elder sister... come on Anu, there is nothing between both of us, Anu She referred me for a film audition and I did it What?... Film... and you acted? Oh... nice... This is a new excuse for you to meet her, right? Anu, you shouldn't be talking light on someone unaware of the facts I had the desire to act from childhood, and so, I attended, that's it If you were interested in acting, you should have tried earlier... ... just because you met her, your acting desire blossomed, right? Tell me the truth Arjun... Are you interested in acting or her? My interest is on acting and not her Hm... I can't keep sitting on the commodes, checking the comfort levels... ... and tolerate the torture of your dad Arjun... ... you are incompetent to talk about my dad Hey...stop... ... I told you to stop What did you say? I am not competent... ... is your dad owner of Apple Company... - he is just running commode company My competence is more than enough for this You were loafing around without a job... ... my dad has given you a job and his daughter too, and you are talking big Shit... Hi aunty Hm Hey... Both of them seem to be angry Did I ask you to marry me... ... did I ask your dad for a job? ... because I nodded my head for whatever you both said... ... so, I don't have the competence Of all the people I married you... shit... Correct... had you not married me, you could have had jolly time with her... ... you could have done anything You are getting irritated because I am questioning you Hey... you are again pointing at her Yes... had I not married you... ... I would have been happy with her, ok? Ok? Then why did you agree to marry me? If you had not agreed, I would have been happy with him Even now you can go and marry the boy of your dad's choice I will give you divorce if you want - Divorce!? Divorce...? So, you have reached that stage? Then what? There is no love or understanding Rather than living like this, let's divorce and live peacefully Don't you have love for me? No... no... To summarize... ... not confining your love to one girl... marrying another girl... ... having troubled her and yourself... ... and now troubling us too So, it is entirely your mistake - Yes boss So, you are found to be guilty How can you make me responsible for everything? Hm..? Making me marry a girl who should have been my best friend for life... ... the God who is watching us quarrel... ... he is responsible for all this He is the one who destined my fate and he is the real culprit Hello... The culprit is nowhere else... ... you said God... ... he is sitting right in front of you He...!? - Yes brother Poor guy... how can he be responsible?
