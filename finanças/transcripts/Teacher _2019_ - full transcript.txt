(DARK LOW MUSIC) (LOCKERS SLAMMING) (HALLWAY CHATTER) JAMES:(VOICE OVER) They make you give in. Eat their poison, bit by bit. Years pass. The shame changes nothing but its clothes. (LAUGHING) Ah! No, no! Come on. Today, you drown, faggot. No, God, please! Let me go, please! No! No! (GURGLING) (SPLASHING) I changed my mind. You can drown tomorrow. (COUGHING) He hath disgraced me and hinder-ed me half a million laugh-ed - It's 'laughed', Bill. Punctuation is different, it's just pronounced the same. Oh. Okay. That was... good. Okay, who's next? Mocked at my gains scorned my nation thwarted my bargains... Somebody likes to open their mouth for teacher. (MOANING) Aided my enemies. What was that, Tim? Oh, nothing, Mr. Lewis. We were just talking about the play. Mm-hmm (AFFIRMATIVE). Okay, what's the title of the play that we're reading? Uh. (LAUGHTER) Yeah, okay. Who's next? Daniella? You can do it. Is it okay if I don't, Mr. Lewis? Just read a little bit. Everybody reads. And what's his reason... B-b-brain damage. (LAUGHTER) Excuse me? The next person who disrupts another student reading can hock and yuck their way all the way down to Vice Principal Olsen's office. Got it? (BEEPING) I forgot, short period. Okay, Act Three next time, folks. Chica needs to learn her englaciona. Hey, Mr. Lewis. Is it still okay if I take pictures later for the paper? Of course. I'll be there, okay? Thanks, Mr. Lewis. What can I do for you, Daniella? I was wondering if, if there was any extra - (BANGING IN HALLWAY) (CROWD JEERING) Hey, hey, stop! Right now! Come on! Stop! What happened? What happened? Preston? I-I didn't see anything. You don't have to worry about him. What happened? Tim started it. Fuck you! That is enough! Against that wall. Come on, against that wall. Juan over there. (BEEPING) Back to class. I'm sorry Daniella, let me write you a pass, okay? We'll talk later. Let's go, now. Get your stuff. What's it to be, gentlemen? You think my hallways are the place for UFC auditions? I guess you want a six-month summer vacation. Get suspended? No sir. I could expel you for this, young man. But if you can grow up for five seconds, apologize and shake hands, I'll talk it over with your parents. It's your decision. Sorry. It's cool. Alright. Get a pass from the desk. Don't quote me, but paddles were invented for kids like that. Maybe you shut them up for a while. Harold, can I ask how things are looking for me? Enjoy the uncertainty. After tenure, you'll be stuck here forever. TODD: Are you sure Tim threw the first punch? Yeah, one of my student witnessed it. He's honest. Tim actually picks on him a little bit. Well that's great, it just turned scouting season, too. Idiot. Straight at him, Tim! I've got to get back to work. Yeah. You can come inside, you know. I didn't want to bother anyone. We're not wildlife. Well, except for Tim Cooper. You should go sit next to Daniella. Come on, give her some pointers on her homework. Hey, um. Mr. Lewis said it would be okay if I came up here to take some pictures? Yeah, that's fine. Are you here for Mr. Lewis? My brother drives me. Ooh. Amigo. Nice. That's a really cool camera. Thanks, it's my dad's, but I'm the only one who knows how to use it. Because you're like a genius, right? You're probably smarter than me. That's so stupid. No it's not. What part are you on? MEDIATOR: A major point of friction at our last session was the house. [ MALE ATTORNEY] We've agreed to equal distributions. We asked for a full vacancy by May. School's still in session. Look, I'm working and I'll be moved out within a few days. It's second semester. I'm in ACT Prep, Finals, I've got my tenure. I'm being really nice about this, James, considering the way you've been. Look, Sarah, I'm not saying that we were Ozzie and Harriet, okay, but it's not like I ever touched you. God, no, you just punched holes in walls. That happened one time. I was terrified and you... I am, I'm done, I'm done. With your mood swings, and the drinking, and I need this to be over with, and I need you to be out of that house, please. I'm sorry. Sorry that this divorce isn't convenient for you. I am sure, phoenix that you are, you will rise from the ashes and be just fine. That'll be enough of that, Mr. Louis. (TYPING) JAMES:(VOICE OVER) This isn't the life we promised each other. (TYPING) Ourselves. The past is too present. They say that we can never go home again. In truth, we never leave. (YELLING) MAN: Don't you worry about me and my job! WOMAN: Of course I worry - MAN: You don't have to worry about that. I'm worried about it all the time! (GLASS BREAKING) (ARGUING) Well of course, they're expecting you because you're the town fucking drunk! Ow! Go ahead, you coward. MAN: Say it again. You're a fucking deadbeat, drunk, coward man that's a piece of shit! (DOOR SLAMS) James? Oh my God James, what happened to you? I slipped and fell into a lake. Dammit James, don't get it all over the house! Come here! Geez. Take this off. Come on, hands up. What really happened? Geez. I wasn't looking. Yeah, so what else is new? Goddammit James. If your father saw you like this, God only knows what the hell he would do. This is a brand new sweater! I want to put this on the fridge, okay? Okay, mom. I wanted to get money, right? Come here. (UPBEAT MUSIC) (GLASS SHATTERS) You're already there. Might as well contribute. Make it whole. Make a whole fucking family. Ow. Fuck. I haven't seen you this year. Car broke down. Ooh, hey pussy. Miss you buddy. Preston the pussy. I think you got some cum in your hair. Oh, you like that? I know you like that. Huh? Harder? You want it harder? What are you looking at? What, are you in love with me? DRIVER: Stay in your seat, please. Yeah, stay in your seat pussy. Fucking. Huh. To Shylock, the Venetians are oppressive racists, but to Venetians, Shylock is a vindictive murderer. Who's right? There's two very different moral centers there. Which one do you believe has the moral high ground? Mm-hmm? Well, if Shylock is planning on cutting out Antonio's stomach, then he is a murderer, right? Absolutely. A murderer. But. Isn't Shylock also a victim? I think he has to be both. That's the paradox of it. Continue, Preston. I mean, does being a victim make a person good? I mean, that's something that happens to you, not something that you do. What do you guys think? Anyone? Claims of obsolescence have been levied against English teachers for years. We need to prove that we have practical utility. There are many discussions in the department about that, as you know. Many discussions. James is also working on a novel. Really? Yeah, it's about a man who's going to lose his tether on reality after his wife passes away. Not autobiographical, I hope. No, not at all. I understand you witnessed an altercation between Tim Cooper and another boy earlier this week? Yeah, just outside of my classroom. WARREN: You reported that Tim instigated? Another student witnessed the start of it. You didn't witness it yourself? No, but I assure you the student's trustworthy. It's Preston Walsh. I'm sure he is. Thank you, James. I think that about does it for this round. Okay, thank you. Oh no, it's okay. What was that? Juan's parents called Warren out of the blue and asked him to show mercy on Tim. I have a hard time picturing that. No suspension, no detention. Warren's call. So now I'm in Warren's crosshairs? Everything's fine. This isn't Kafka. (AIRPLANE ROARING) We should probably grab seats. There's my friend. I should say hi. Do you have a lot of studying to do? Hi. Hey. How are you? Good. Oh, these are my parents. Hi, Eugene. Rosa. Lisa. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you as well. Tim Cooper punched a kid in the nose, gets the boys will be boys treatment. Oh, you've met his dad. Clouds need permission to rain on his lawn. He probably paid that family off. I don't want to think about that. Well, you know how it is. If you're born poor, you wish upon a star, if you're born here, you just write a check. So how's it going with you and Sarah? Couple more boxes, that's it. Bachelor pad, U.S.A. Freedom! No. Go get them! No. I don't know, maybe I'll open a wine bar, call it Middle Aged. I don't get it. Oh, because you age the wine. That's very funny. You know her? Her? No. Never met her. Go talk to her. Nope. Just go talk to her. Todd, my marriage is fresh - Arrabella! Get over here girlfriend! How are you doing? Good, how are you? Good, good good. Good. Oh, you're like an Olympic hugger. Well, someone has to make you feel loved, you sad, sad man. Oh! Do you know James Lewis, from the English department? No, hi. Hi, it's so good to meet you. Oh, what happened to your hand? Oh, just bumped it moving furniture. It's stupid. Weak bones. We've known each other since college, actually. I actually brought James here from the city. Got him a job. And now he's facing judgment soon. Tenure. Oh, wow! Congratulations! That's great. Yeah, we'll see. I feel like Warren's got it out for me. Well, he wouldn't have kept you around this long if he didn't want you here, right? That's what people said about my ex-wife, and... Ah, I would not have said that out loud. Anyways, there's a, I've got to get back to work. It was great to meet you, thanks. Yeah, it was a fun conversation. Go get them. It was nice meeting you. You too! Charmer. He, he's sweet. I mean, he mentioned his ex-wife within ten seconds of us meeting. I think that's an Olympic record. He's bitter-sweet. Hey, Mr. Lewis. Hi Tim. Good to see you again James. Mr. Cooper. Bernie, please. We don't want to take much of your time, but Tim would like to apologize to you for his behavior. Yeah, I'm really sorry about that. Won't happen again. I appreciate that, Tim. Feel like you still owe an apology to Juan. Definitely Preston, for what you said to him. Yeah, I'll talk to them. That's great. Alright Tim, thanks. Give us a minute, will you? So, about our pain in the ass kid. Julie and I are deeply concerned about his grades. Especially in your class. Just stay on him. And then call me, anytime. Well we certainly appreciate that. Yes. Oh, and congratulations on your tenure. I hear it's almost complete. You certainly do your homework. No, it's nothing. Warren and I golf, my kid's in your class. You know. We would love to put in a good word for you, and you know, if there's any attention that you could pay to Tim, to help him keep his grade up? It would mean the world to us. Yeah, I'll do my best. Home number's on the back there. Great, thanks. Good luck. Yeah, have a good evening. You too. (TYPING) (BEEPING) Hey, how's it going? Hey. I'm good. I didn't know you had this lunch hour. Yeah, I saw you here the other day, and I thought, just saying hello. Hey. Where do you sit? Over there, normally. Anyway, there's this project that I'm working on, and I don't know - Watch your ass! Right, I've got it. Maybe you should leave him alone. Maybe you should tell me what his cum tastes like. I'm so sorry. He's a jerk. It's not your fault. No, for what he said. You didn't say it. Well no, but, sorry. What were you going to ask me? Okay, uh. What is this for? It's for a photo project I'm doing. Uh, what do you want me to do? I need a human subject. I think the camera's going to like you. Cameras hate me. They like send out newsletters about it. I'm camera-cursed. Come on, trust me. Open your eyes. Preston! Look. Let me see the camera. Uh, hey, no. Alright. Alright. (DOOR SLAMS) So you have until July to sign these. I appreciate that. Give me a couple days to look it over. For what? Just sign them. Alright, do what you want. Sarah, I never meant to scare you. Okay? You know that I'd never hurt you. Yeah, alright. God. Same words, different day, James. JAMES: Pages of a calendar thrown away. Days, months, years, all the memories and colors run together. A smear of brown, maybe that's all we are. (BACKGROUND CHATTERING) (LIGHT HAUNTING MUSIC) (CROWD CHEERING) Alright buddy, you can do it! One, two, three come on! Come on, Tim! I come from a sports family and I love track, but I wasn't tall enough and I got left behind, literally. Oh. Yeah. Strike! My parents were professional complainers. Oh yeah? Oh yeah, very, very good at it. Strike two! Any chance you'd wanna grab a beer after this? Yeah. Alright buddy, one more time! I want one more. Come on, shut him down. COACH: One more, let's go, buddy, here we go. STUDENT: Woo, one more time! STUDENT: Yeah Tim, you got this. (LIGHT HAUNTING MUSIC) (CROWD GASPING) It's okay, it's okay. Come on! Shake it off, buddy, come on! One more time, come on! (CROWD ENCOURAGING) (CROWD GROANING) (BACKGROUND CHATTERING) (LIGHT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (CROWD GROANING) This is a waste of time. Every home was slaughtering a goat for the end of Ramadan and the streets were literally flowing with blood. Well, yeah, that is horrifying. Yeah, especially when you're trying to be a vegetarian. (BACKGROUND CHATTERING) What's on your mind? It's not date worthy. Oh, come on, I mean you don't have to talk about it, but... But you do have to talk about it, You do, yeah. You don't have to, but you kind of do. I can tell it's super juicy. Do you play the tiny violin? I play the trombone, Oh! That would even be... Actually. That would be funny, wow. (LAUGHING) I, (MUMBLING) ugh, dumb, my divorce, I gotta stack papers and, Yeah. Just need one last squiggle and then it's off to eternity, you know. Hm, I know how that goes, I actually got a divorce too one year before I came to Prairie Trail. He accepted a promotion that sent him overseas, he told me he didn't want any kids and that was that. Dufus. ARABELLA: Idiot. Idiot, dum dum. ARABELLA: Dork. I'm sorry. No, no, don't be. You need to perk up. Come on, you got the pretty science nerd to imbibe with you on a school night. You know, I'm an English teacher. ARABELLA: Okay. I got one good joke in tonight. ARABELLA: You got one. It's pretty good. Call me. Absolutely. I'll see ya. Okay. Okay, bye. (LIGHT HAUNTING MUSIC) Hey, close that window! I feel sick! DRIVER: Close that window or I'm gonna stop this bus! STUDENT: Yo, I'm about to throw up, fuck off. What's your name? Look, man, I'm sorry, I'm just sick, I don't know what to tell you. Close that window or I will throw you off this bus! Ah, ah! My God, okay, I'll just fucking throw up all over everybody. Uh! Hey, you're scared of me, right? Just say you're afraid of me and that you're a worthless fag and I'll stop. I'm scared of you, I'm a worthless fag. That's right, that's what you are and if you talk to anyone about me again or you take my picture, I'll kill you and your spic girlfriend. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Thou calledst me a dog before thou hadst a cause, since I am a dog, beware my fangs. Doing great, keep going. Why doesn't he just take the money? Why do you think? Maybe because it won't stop anything, like Antonio might be nice to him for a week or something, but he'll do it again and I think Shylock just wanted to stop. Does Shylock believe it will stop if he takes Antonio's flesh? No, but people would take him more seriously and maybe they'd be afraid. They're only begging him for mercy because they're scared and I can understand why he's saying no. Why? Because he knows they hate him. Daniela, Dan... (HUSHED CHATTERING) Hey, hey, hey, what's wrong, what happened to your back? It's nothing, Mr. Lewis. It's not nothing! How long has this been happening? Search my computer, check my handwriting, I didn't do any of it. Why would they lie, Tim? I don't know, Mr. Olson. What about this assault on the bus? He can't just say something and get me in trouble, no one saw it because it didn't happen. I promise this isn't going to happen again to either of you. Is he gonna get in trouble? We're looking into it, either myself or Mr. Lewis will let you know. This was by the book assault. The only way to prove anything is to send this to the police, the school doesn't want that and Daniela's family doesn't want that, trust me, it's going to stop. We need to hang on until summer, please work with me. (PHONE RINGING) JULIE: Hello? Hi, Mrs. Cooper, this is James Lewis, I'm Tim's teacher. JULIE: Yes, I remember, of course, how are you? I'm fine, how are you? I'm fine. It's Tim's teacher. BERNIE: Hand me that. Hello? I'm sorry to bother you, Bernie, but, well, we've had a close call with Tim's behavior. BERNIE: What happened? I'm actually in the neighborhood and I was wondering if maybe I could swing by? We could talk in person? Is it serious? It's moderately serious, it's something that I'm hoping we can work together on and prevent from escalating, I don't want this to get any worse. BERNIE: Okay, yeah, sure, come on by. Great, I'll see you soon. Hey, Bernie. Thanks for letting me stop by. Sure, no problem, come on in. (BIRDS TWITTERING) (CLOCK TICKING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Here you are, James. Thank you. The house is... Thank you, darling. This is lovely, it's amazing. Oh, it's all Julie, I assure you and maybe a couple of family photos for me and of course the big boys on the mantle, but otherwise it's all her. You were in the service? No, just an enthusiast. In any case, James, what is going on with Timothy? Okay, this isn't easy, but it's gonna be fine. Today Tim was implicated in the assault of another student and in the creation of a pornographic website targeted at this student and his girlfriend. Well, you say implicated? Yes, there's, allegations that Tim pushed a needle through a bus seat into the student's back. Now, the injuries aren't terrible, but this has got to stop now and that's why I wanted to come here, so that we could come together on this and unify, so we can help Tim, I mean, I want Tim in my class, the team needs Tim. Oh yes, of course and we're certainly grateful for you coming to us with this. Did you say a needle? Yes, sir. Well, that just sounds insane. Well, we don't even know if he did it yet. Of course he did it, James wouldn't be here unless there were witnesses. (DOOR CLOSING) That's gotta be him, Tim, Tim! Come in here, please! TIM: Yeah, give me a sec! Hi, Tim. BERNIE: You wanna tell us what the hell's going on here? I don't know, what is going on here? Mr. Lewis was just telling us about some stunt on the internet. I didn't do that. Look at me, when I'm talking to you. Bernie. And you assaulted a student on the bus? I didn't do that. Be truthful, Timothy. I didn't. Maybe I push him around a little bit, but I didn't assault him. And what about this website? That was Scott's, he made it as a joke to show us and I guess someone shared it, he took it down. Well, there's nothing funny about it now, is there? I didn't tell him to make it. Alright, well you need to promise both of us right now, that you're done with these guys. School and sports, that's all you have time for, promise us. I swear. BERNIE: I'm so sorry you had to see this. Of course, not at all. Thank you for coming. Of course. I'll show you out. I gotta say, you really had me and my wife thinking that our son was about to be arrested, I mean, she's in there crying. Bernie, I just wanted to get this... Did you talk to Warren or the other one, Harold before coming here? No, this is a conversation, you know, just between you and I. Right, right and you arrived here what, two minutes after calling? Yeah, because I was in the neighborhood, I thought this was a conversation best had face to face. Right, okay, thank you. Of course. Remind me to buy milk in the morning. Hey, (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE). Hey, how was the game? We won, it was alright. He hit a home run and a double. You always do better when I'm working. You should stop working so much, you won't miss out. Hey, how about you stop costing so much, tough guy? Hm, you have homework? A little bit. Well, you'd better get to it, it's getting late. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hey, sorry, are you busy? It's fine, I'm done. How is it? Hard. It's not hard, you're not really learning, right? I guess. What's going on? You know my friend, Carlos? Yeah. He, he sent me this drawing, it's of you. I guess kids at school are texting it around. Show me. It's really dumb. You know it has nothing to do with how you are in reality, right? (LIGHT HAUNTING MUSIC) They said they'd delete it, but it's on the internet, it's gonna be here forever. Who drew this? (DOG BARKING) (LIGHT HAUNTING MUSIC) Uh, ah! Uh! Ah! Uh, uh, uh! Uh! Okay, there's only a few short answer questions, so you should choose your time focused on your essays. These aren't text messages. (STUDENTS LAUGHING) Whole words, please. Get started. Mr. Lewis, can I get a pass? Let me know if you hear anything. (LAUGHING) (PHONE RINGING) LISA: Daniela? I'll be right back. (SOBBING) What's going on, what happened? He's in Saint Augustine, somebody robbed him. (LIGHT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Who was it? I don't know what you're talking about. You think this is a game? Mr. Lewis. (STUDENTS EXCLAIMING SURPRISE) You're a fucking perfect sociopath. Tell me now! Or what? Excuse me? Or what, Mr. Lewis. I will... Mr. Lewis? Principal May. I have to go. I actually studied really hard for this, as if you give a shit. (LIGHT HAUNTING MUSIC) I just heard, I think there's somewhere else you need to be, hm? It's alright, I'll tend to your class. Sorry, everyone. (MACHINES BEEPING QUIETLY) (MELANCHOLIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) I am so sorry. They, they have him medicated, so he should be okay. Lisa, please sit down. No. I wanna stand. He can see me better if he wakes, when he wakes, I can be standing here. You said he was attacked by two men? That's what the police said. Okay. I'm sorry. You know who did this? I don't, Eugene. It's those boys from the team. The police are saying that the parents provided alibis, they say that there are no witnesses. You must have seen, I haven't seen. You have to do something. They broke his glasses into his eye, he can't see. I'm sorry. I'll do everything that I can, I promise. (MELANCHOLIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Daniela, eat. I'm not hungry. Eat anyways.

It's gone, Bill. Sports is entirely out of the picture. How old are you? BILL: 16. PRINCIPAL: 16-years-old. Your parents had high hopes for you at 16. You realize what this has done? (SIGHS) Danila Lopez tried to take her life last night. She alright? HAROLD: Yeah. The family... They found her in the middle of it. Christ. Scott and Bill confessed to the assault on Preston. The police are letting their parents pick them up and take them for booking. Yeah, what about Tim? Did you go to Bernard Cooper's house the other day? Yeah, he gave me his card. I stopped by so I could speak with him. And you berated Tim during a test in the middle of the classroom. All due respect, Harold, two of our students almost died. Tell me about it! As if there wasn't enough chum for Cooper's lawyers. They're now saying that you've been coaxing Preston to lash out at Tim! That's fucking absurd! That man may be rich, but he cannot buy reality. The card from Preston's camera was found after his attack. It has dozens of photos of Tim. It's like he was obsessed. James, you go to the man's house and don't tell me? Because you're fucking afraid of him. You're right. Bernard and Julie Cooper's names are etched in brick outside. They paid their lawyers more in a week what I make in a semester. But you ignored those realities with this undercover righteousness of yours! I'm making a statement to the police. Do whatever you want and then go home. As long as your name is being bandied about in this, we can't have you and Tim in the same classroom. And frankly, I doubt that you'll be joining us next fall. I'm sorry James, but this is all too much. Oh, you're right. It is. Fuck it! (DOOR SLAMS) (SINISTER MUSIC) (DOORBELL RINGS) Hey! Sorry for just dropping by like this. Hi Bernie. What can I do for you? I was hoping we could chat for a bit. This actually isn't a great time for me. It'll just take a minute, and I promise what I have to say is quite beneficial. Okay. I suppose I could use a drink. JAMES: You got it. Are you moving? (SIGHS) Yeah. I'm actually going through a divorce right now. (DRINK SPLASHING) I have to be out by summer. I don't have any ice. Neat's okay. That's fine. Well, I'm sorry about the ball and chain or congratulations, perhaps. (CHUCKLES) It's been a long time coming. I see. Why don't I get to the point of why I've come today? I wanted to tell you face to face that if you were thinking about getting another teaching job anywhere in this state, you should think again. Bernie. Bernard. I work 80 hours a week for 35 years to make sure that my son will get the best education and the best school in the best part of town. Instead of teaching him to be a man, you liberal arts pansies would rather he massage the clit of his inner child and philosophize about why his father is a bourgeois monster. You drag 'em in, you make accusations, you lie to the police. I didn't lie. What the hell do you know about anything? All you fags are just too goddamn sensitive to see the world for what it is. Now, you should take my advice and start looking for a new life and never talk to my kid again. And just so we're clear, princess, this is the nice version of things.

Forget about it, okay? He's just an asshole. Fucking asshole. James. I wish I'd pick the can up off the table and smashed it on that guy's head. Hmm. And then what? And then he would have said Au. You think someone might have done that to him when he was younger? That's... You see what's happening? No. In our world right now? It's ridiculous. It's like people like you and me, we're getting walked all over. Oh my god, you're educated, you're smart? Fuck you. The meek inherit nothing but false promises and maybe sometimes we should fucking strike back, right? No, I don't believe that. We can move past our sorrows, it's not for them. (HUMMING) (LAUGHS) It's such a happy thought but it's like this bark in the dark, it just it means nothing, it's... Dies. No, you're just drunk. I'm not drunk. You're so drunk. I'm not so drunk. Listen. Think about it. A guy like that, right? They're just wrong, they're wrong, but nature rewards them for it, okay? Like our bosses and politicians and the elites of the world. They're thriving on their sociopathy and their narcissism, their fucking cruelty, but there's just no amount of after school Warm Fuzzies that are gonna change the beat of human history. I wish that things were different. They're just not. It's like sometimes you gotta pick a side. I see. Yeah. That's how you feel? Yeah. Okay. Say a girl, a really happy, healthy girl gets raped her sophomore year of college. This guys she was seeing is senior. He was perfect, he was the nice guy, clean cut, handsome. And... She passed out in his bed and she... She woke to a... (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) She went to the administration, to the police. He said, she said you know. And the case just died. And he graduated with honors. And she fucking hated him and... She did a lot of stupid things to herself, but she rebuilt and she's a really happy person. As hard as this feels right now, James, it is not the end. You'll make it past this. Statistically that was not the first time that guy fucking did that and it wasn't the fucking last time that he did that and now he's sitting somewhere and he's rich, and it's like if you'd allowed yourself to hate him, then you could have stopped him from doing it to the next person. I'm just saying it's... Go fuck yourself! (KEYS CLACKING) (CHUCKLES) (KEYS CLACKING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) I feel sorry for him. I feel sorry for all my students. I can make him safe as a victim like the rest of us. There will be no more broken bones or locker notes. There will no more hospitals. There will be no more, there will be no more, there will be no more. (THUDDING) No. (WATER SPLASHING) (INTERCOM BEEPS) (WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON INTERCOM) Hey, Ms. Walsh. Hi sweetheart. Another day, big man? That's what they tell me. BOY: Hi, thank you for coming. Watch your legs. Thanks. Hi, Mr. Willis. Hi. How you're holding up? Is everything okay? I heard you were in trouble. No. The whole school is in trouble. You don't have to worry about that, okay? How was it today? I made it the whole length. Really. Well, that's really good. It's fine. No. That's really good. I need to be going, guys. I just wanted to stop by. We'll see you soon, right? You bet.

(SCOFFS) I don't think I've ever run into a student here before. Meeting somebody? No, I'm... Wait, why are you here? I used to live right down that road. My buddy manages the shoe store inside. How about you? I had some plans that fell through. Some neat stores in this mall. Need a pair of shoes? No, I'm... I'm gonna head home. Alright, I'll walk with you. What's wrong? I'm not sure I'm supposed to be with you. My dad said... I'm still your teacher, Tim. We can walk together, I promise. Yeah, okay. You're parked over here too? No, I'm a floor up, where are you at? This is me right here. Drive safe, okay, Tim. Yeah. Thanks. Hey, it looks like someone was having some fun out here. You should come and have a look. What the fuck, are you kidding me? Security's terrible here. You have a spare? I don't have two! Right, yes, I guess that's why I'm an English teacher. You know where I can get a tow around here? JAMES: Yeah, I know a couple of places, it's gonna really cost you though. I'll just put it on my card. You know what, I know a place, auto parts, tires, 10 minutes from here, I'll take you, we could change the tire together, that way you don't have to sit around waiting for a tow. Come on. No, I'll just wait, I'm fine. Tim, if you wait here for a tow, you're not gonna be on the road until rush hour. I tell you what, I can give you some tips about the final exam. TIM: Okay. Thanks. I'm just gonna take a short cut through the nature preserve. Cool. I used to come here on field trips, when I was a little bit younger than you, I always liked it, but the other kids thought it was boring. Yeah, there's no service out here. Preston's blind in one eye. Probably hard to take pictures without any depth perception, he may even have a limp, but his brain's okay, so he can remember all of it. Are we lost? No, it just goes around and around in circles back here. I remember when I was your age, Colin Dalton and his friends. Why are you stopping? What are you doing? When I was 12, I found my father with one of these stuck in his mouth, he's drunk and he beat me to a pulp for walking in on him, then he finished the job a couple of years later in a motel room somewhere. I'd say that my aim is pretty foolproof from this range, wouldn't you, Tim? (LIGHT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Please. I don't wanna hurt you, Tim, okay, you just do what I say. We're gonna be driving home soon, I promise. Do you understand? Okay. Okay. Good boy. Don't do that, open it, open the door. No! Now! No! Open it! No! No, no! Tim, Tim, Tim, the nearest police station's 10 miles from here and you wouldn't even know which way to go, okay. Come on, stand up, come on. Just walk, it's okay. Little bit further. I need you to confess, Tim. Confess what, what do you want? You got Bill and Scott to destroy Preston's life. You tormented Daniela, you're the ringleader of all of it. I didn't make them do shit. You set an example, you drove that poor girl to try and kill herself. Live with that, huh? I need you to admit it. Admit it! Come on, Timothy, I need you to say something, for the love of fucking God, say it! Fuck you. You'll never understand. Oh, I understand, I understand that you're a privileged, spoiled little shit, who can destroy a kid's life one day, fucking blind him and the next day you're online bragging to some girl about how you were partying on a yacht with your rich friends doing fucking blow! What do you know about what I do? Teachers know their students. No, no, no, no, no, no., no, no. You're hurt, you did all of this, you're a fucking psycho, you're a fucking loser, you will always be a pathetic, fucking loser psycho, uh! Uh! Uh! Please, please. Why did you do it to him? TIM: Please. (SOBBING) Why did you do it to all of us? You and your damn father, Goddamn you! Please, uh! Damn you! Please, uh, uh! No, no, no, no! Please, please, you don't understand, you don't know what he does, please. He does it to the bottom of my feet, so that no one can see. He calls it training. When I've done something wrong, or he just had a bad day, he uses his belt or sometimes the grip of his putter. When I got taken out of the game, my Dad locked me in the furnace room for the night and after you left our house, he made me run on the treadmill till I threw up all over myself and then he made me clean it up. Tim. And Bill and Scott were the only ones who ever tried to protect me. They blinded Preston, they put him in the hospital. They made a mistake! Haven't you ever made a mistake? And now you wanna fucking kill me. Tim. No, no, no, please, no, no, no! Tim, Tim, it's okay, it's over. It's okay. (MELANCHOLIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) We can pick up your car tomorrow. It's fine. Tim, just think about who you'd be, if you hadn't been raised inside this house. I think about that every day. Tim. I'm sorry. Me too. (PHONE RINGING) OPERATOR: 911, what's your emergency? I need to report a domestic assault, 1218 Darrian Road. OPERATOR: Are you inside the house, sir? No, I'm outside, I came to tutor a student and he's in danger, his father's attacking him, I'm afraid he might kill him. OPERATOR: How old is the child? He's 16, he's just a kid. OPERATOR: What's your name? James Lewis. There's guns in the house. OPERATOR: Does the father have a gun now? Yes, he does, please hurry. OPERATOR: Okay, the police are on their way. Stay safe, stay calm and stay on the phone. How long will they take? OPERATOR: They'll be there within five minutes. Where are you, sir, can you see what's going on? Oh, God! (LIGHT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Who is this girl? I met her online. BERNIE: You're a fucking idiot, you know that? You're an idiot. Yeah, okay, I'm an idiot. Just calm down. Why didn't you call us? My phone is dead. You charge it in the fucking car! The car battery died! Why are you lying? Enough, okay, I've had it with this, do you hear me, I've had it. You're okay that our son thinks we're fucking morons? We're just an ATM to you, is that it? The fucking car battery died! Son of a bitch! Uh! JULIE: Bernie! Jesus Christ! (GUN FIRING) Get away from him, I'll blow your fucking head off, Bernie. What the fuck are you doing in my house? Julie, Tim, go outside. Go! (SHRIEKING) Mom! What do you think you're doing? Why do you do it, Bernie, why do you do this to your family, hm? Come on, tell, me, you! (SHRIEKING) You're a fucking coward. I'm protecting them. You may not like this, but fear is how you gain respect. No. No? What's the gun for then? Stopping you. Yeah, then what, you gonna shoot me? Do you even know? Okay, I'm done, shoot the scary man. Oh, God. Set the example for the student, be a hero. Come on! Oh. I'm not like you. No, you certainly aren't. Bernard! (GUN FIRING) Oh, God, stop! Stop, stop! You come into my house and threaten my family, you're going to the morgue. Tim, no, no, Tim. Tim, what are you doing? Timothy, Timothy! You have to stop. It's over. Put it down, Tim. I'm gonna tell 'em, Dad. You're gonna tell who what? The police. Either I tell them everything or you kill me. No, Tim! I can't fucking take this anymore. Tim. Don't talk to him. Tim. No! Mr. Lewis, you were right, I have to do something. I have to. It's okay, it's okay, sweetheart, Timmy, put it down. (LIGHT HAUNTING MUSIC) Put it down. TIM: It has to stop. (POLICE SIRENS APPROACHING) Alright. Oh. Alright, tell 'em whatever you want, just put it down, I'll do what you want. (SOBBING) (LIGHT MELANCHOLIC MUSIC) What do we do? Tell the truth. Be brave. (MELANCHOLIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) I'm starting to recognize myself again as I survive in this place. I've written everyone bartering words for seconds off my time here. Life now is a cycle of routine and regret for how I treated those who loved me, those who hated me and those like you, whom I punished for trying to reach me. I'm so sorry. I wish I knew you better, I wish I knew you now. So we're at one of these oxygen bars. What the fuck is an oxygen bar? Basically you put this like tubing up your nose, like you have emphysema and then you just breathe this like flavored air. Like incense? No, no, no, no, it's like pure oxygen, it's supposed to be relaxing. Sounds like it. Yeah, I'm gonna see him again tonight, I'm gonna cook dinner for him over at his house. How is everybody? Tim accepted a partial scholarship to State, not the best, not the worst, but I'm sure that the headlines helped. Preston is settling in, but still going strong with Daniela. (BACKGROUND CHATTERING) Arabella? Yeah, I've got something to give you, took three minutes for the damn guards to approve. Just tell her I, nothing, just leave her alone. Is there anything I can do for ya? Keep showing up, it's enough. (LIGHT HAUNTING MUSIC) Everyone has their own opinion, their own perspective, but whose perspective is valid? Anyone's? No one's? Hm? Yes? The villain's. Okay. The liar. The liar, so say dishonest. (PRISON BELL BUZZING) GUARD: Count, back to your cells. Count, let's go. DWAYNE: So they called this play a comedy? Well, any play that didn't end in a bloodbath was considered a comedy in Shakespeare's time. Ah, I guess that's one way of looking at it. I'll see you tomorrow, good work, Dwayne. DWAYNE: Thank you.
