And you will be telling me you have to leave. - How do you know so much? - I don't know so much, but I do know you are going to go. - I won't be long. In fact, I'm only going so that I can come back. - Now, I have to go to albertstrasse to meet some liar from Romania. Nasty piece of film, stennings. I wouldn't like to think of fassett seeing it. He didn't know we had a surveillance system in operation. What exactly was the wife's category? - She was a Cypher clerk in the Polish embassy. They, ah, ran her as a string on fassett. - And why did they terminate her? - We're not certain, but it did clear up a potentially messy situation. We were having trouble in that area, as I'm sure you'll recall. - And fassett? He never knew you made a trade with the kgb, sir. He didn't know you sanctioned her killing. He went wild trying to find her killers. - And in the process he uncovered omega, did he not? He uncovered Joseph cardone, stock manipulator with a low profile, heavy clients, tax shelter expert. Richard tremayne, prestigious plastic surgeon with more than his share of patients and a wife with a nose problem. Bernie osterman, midnight financier, TV writer/producer with three series on the air. Clean, but very liberal. All, surprisingly enough, connected with our old friend, Mr. Kgb himself, andrei mikalovich. However, I think that fassett's premise is dangerous because it's based on the non-benevolent ambition of one man, John Tanner. His whole plan depends on their mutual friendship. As you know, Tanner's your number one critic. My advice is to turn them over to my section. However, I might be wrong. - Being wrong, stennings, is not nearly as important as not admitting it. Not these days. - He's excellent, there's no denying it. But you don't like him. He's too much of an individual. Takes too many shortcuts. - Well, maybe the time for shortcuts are upon us. - I think the way fassett wants to handle omega is a high-visibility risk. With your political prospects, well, it's an unacceptable element. - You think I'll get where I'm going without risk? - There are degrees of acceptability, sir. Omega in itself is a, well, it's a highly sensitive matter. If it were to become public, I think it could be disastrous. - What if it became public at exactly the right time? - I think fassett seriously complicates any such timing, sir. The man, well he's... - He's something you're not and never will be. - He's a field operative. - I don't think nostalgia is the right instinct at this time, sir. - Bring in Mr. Fassett. Mr. Fassett? - M r. Fassett, I must tell you I was impressed by your presentation. Most impressed. - Thank you, sir. I'd be giving away no secrets, however, if I told you that Mr. Stennings here has a less positive attitude. Walter. - Well, you've uncovered three agents in the omega network. Your data indicates they're very high-level. Probably the highest below their kgb control, our good friend Mr. Mikalovich. I think they should be picked up and turned over to debriefing. - You can't pick them up without ringing a bell. No, I think the best and the most efficient way of unravelling omega is to turn one of these three. Then you get a very powerful reaction. Betrayal. Even traitors feel betrayal. - And you propose to use John Tanner to effect this? - Well, I've studied him and they say that converts make the greater zealots. Well, it's certainly true with Tanner. He's more American than Americans. He's a bigot about truth, democracy, and justice. If we can convince him that his friends are spies, and we can convince him, then he will feel compelled, compelled to aid us. And with Tanner's help, then we can break these three. Break them and omega. - Let's take a look. Mr. Tanner should be getting nicely warmed up by now. - Welcome back. We 're not talking about agent orange. We 're just talking - to general keever. - Ready two. Take two. Stand by, camera three. - General, you have the responsibility for American germ warfare research. - Take three. - I'm very surprised that you would ask me questions on a subject which you must know is restricted. I'm in the bedroom. I have on that, um... You know the black gown you gave me? What do you mean underneath? Oh, underneath. Let me see. Well I can feel my breast and, ah, my nipples. They're getting very hard now. I'm getting very wet. - You said the Japanese developed German chemical warfare systems. Well, you have to remember the political climate at the time. The Soviet menace was becoming more and more apparent. - There aren't no problems, are they? - Just mine. You're the best. - Yeah, I'm an ace. Hello, gorgeous. - Oh. I thought you said you're not gonna bring the here anymore. Isn't that what you said? - What the hell am I supposed to do? Can't take her to a hotel. - What about a nice, secluded retirement home? - Joseph? Joseph, I'm waiting. - Coming. - Can I rest assured that you'll be able to find my little nest egg a nice profitable short term home? Turn off the TV. - Most of these boys were American. Most of them died. - Still, you're not seeing a single thing, Mr. Osterman. You're seeing possibility. In that, you're an imperfect machine. For these last two moments, we will engage conditions of maximum equality. Excuse me, doctor. Oh, baby. - This just arrived. - Can I open it? - No, thank you. - How much I need... - Fine. - Did you hear what you wanted to know? - I already know what I wanna know. I diagnosed you years ago. - "Diagnosed", you make me sound like I'm some sort of disease. - I got your picture back. - I think... I think that you should hurry up and come right home because I'm very sick and I need my doctor. - Aw, fuck. - What's the matter? - Ah, hello? No, no, nothing. I-I dropped the phone. - My poor little dick. - Ginny, I'll see you soon. - Okay, and darling? - Don't forget my medicine. - That was a lot better, wasn't it? Very well, sir. Hello? Telephone's for you, Mr. Osterman. - There are many reasons for such action here. - We 7! Take a commercial break now. - Cue commercial. - For germ free soap. Next up will be general keever's service record. We 7! Be right back. - Very good. I'll be fascinated to see you work on him. - Yes. And I'll be interested to see your progress reports, Mr. Fassett. - You'll see my requisition list first. - A moment, Mr. Fassett? In considering your proposal, I have cross-read your files. This, ah... This matter of your wife. - Accidents happen, sir. - There are no accidents in war. You were screwing your wife in a foxhole and a mortar shell fell on it. In this omega business, there will be no place for such indulgences. - It's a mistake I'm not likely to make twice, sir. - Good, good. - Oh, in this matter of Tanner, I'm sure that the evidence we have will convince him intellectually, but I think we might need something more. Your presence. I'm sure that you're aware of the technique "hard and soft"? - And what role, Mr. Fassett are you assigning to me? - I think in view of your rank, sir, then you may choose which suits you best. - Best of luck. - Thank you, sir. - This is of great importance to both of us. - Yes, sir. - Hi! Hi, boy. Come on. What about the welfare of the American prisoners, sir? That is not something I can comment on. I think dad's home. Prisoners of war were deliberately wounded. - Yeah, it looks that way. Then their wounds were infected with different kinds of bacteria and intentionally left untreated. Most of these boys were American. Most of them died. As I say, Mr. Tanner, you had to... - Let me make this very clear. No one should mistake the deadly real nature of this game. They are out there. And by "they" I mean the enemy. You asked about coexistence. Yes, coexistence is a fact of life, but really the ultimate goal... Hi, dad! Hi, frank! - Hi, scout! Where've you been? - Went hunting with mom. - Camped out last night. - Get anything? - No, couldn't get a clean shot. - Yeah, they were down in this little ravine. Then they caught wind of us. We needed your help. - Did you teach mom to hunt? - We taught each other. - Gonna take a bath. - Mom says you're a big trophy hunter. What does she mean? Is she just bullshitting? - Come here, you. Come here. Sit down and watch TV. - There's a war being fought now, as we speak. All over this country, all over the world. And, yes, we do have troops in it. And, yes, they're dying. - What do you think of this guy? - He sucks. - You up for this weekend? - Well... guess so. - You used to think they were great. - Hm. Times change. - Not for the better. Huh? - No. Joe didn't used to worship money and hate women. And we used to think that Bernie osterman could actually heal people by making them laugh. And dick was a doctor once upon a time. Now he's a pussy-whipped mechanic who repairs people. Yes? - I have Maxwell Danforth on the line for you. - Hang on. - John Tanner? Maxwell Danforth. - To what do I owe the pleasure? - I need a favour of you, Mr. Tanner. - I 'd like to hear what it is. - Well, I wonder, could we meet? - In person. Face-to-face, as it were. - When? - Today. Transportation is being arranged even as we speak. - Your trophy buck just broke cover. - This way, Mr. Tanner. Fourth floor. - I have an appointment. - Mr. Danforth won't be here. You'll be talking to me. My name's Lawrence fassett. Please. - Maxwell Danforth wanted to see me. - Are you, ah, expecting house guests this weekend? Joe and Betty cardone, Richard and Virginia tremayne, Bernard osterman? The men were from your graduating class at Berkeley. This is the seventh such reunion, events known among you as "ostermans". In honour of their original sponsor. These people represent a grave threat to the security of the United States of America. - Uh-huh. - It's my job to convince you of the truth of these allegations. We could arrest all the conspirators now, but it would be more helpful to the interests of the nation if we could have your assistance over the coming weekend. - What the hell are you talking about? You could arrest who? For what? - If, after I've presented you with the initial evidence, you're not convinced then of course you may go. Keeping your mouth shut, of course. All right, listen carefully. First I wanna know when the weekend is scheduled. - May 17th, at the tanners'. - You have no apprehension of Tanner? He knows nothing of our business, suspects nothing, can have no possible danger to us. - Nonetheless, we think it would be better if he were targeted. - Now that's absolutely unnecessary. - This is not an area in which you have a lot of choice. - This is our deal, Petrov. Nothing happens to Tanner. Otherwise, we meet some place else. - Your partners don't wanna postpone this. - Just remember, we're calling the shots. - They'll be there if you need them. If I ever saw a setup for doctoring tape, this is it. - Be my guest. Cut, cut, cut! The sound's not good 'cause we had them on a directional. That's how long some operations take. We would like to see... - Then we got lucky with a concealed. It would take me considerable time to be ready. You know, I have, uh... I have patients, not clients like cardone. Bernie, he has no loose ends. He just picks up and goes. - These are not my concerns. - I don't wanna be in the country when it comes down. - I think you will find that when the time comes... You will be able to leave the country very quickly indeed. - Who's the man? Andrei mikalovich, kgb. Russian passport. CIA report on mikalovich. Russian technology clearance file. - You know him? - Personally. If you can call tailing somebody for three months personal. Now, this next bit with your friend Bernie is a real gem. I've seen some of his shows. He's very good, isn't he? - Sure, I think the system's in need of radical change. How radical is radical? - Hmm. Extreme, violent, chaotic, apocalyptic, somewhere in there, I think, you know. - Are you willing to help create such conditions, or are you just a coffee-house revolutionary? - No. No, I'm not a revolutionary. What I am is a nihilistic anarchist who lives on residuals. - 50 money would help form your decision? Oh, yes. Yeah, it always has. But what are you asking me? For your talents and your time, we would pay generously. - Numbered bank account. - Swiss? - Where else? - Very good. I will bring you considerable details next time we meet. - Fine. - And I promise you it is simple. There is more, but it's of no consequence. - All right. What's the bottom line? - This is the official secrets act. If you wanna go for the jackpot, then you must sign it. But I warn you that after the signature, then there is no walking away. You sign it and your life isn't gonna be the same. - I'm not your man. I'm cloak, you must be dagger. Mr. Danforth, I won't betray my friends. - You don't have any friends, Tanner. You're on intimate terms with three Russian agents. - I don't believe that. - Oh, yes, you do. That story you were pursuing on your last programme. About germ warfare. - What about it? - Why do you suppose it surfaced after being submerged for almost 40 years? - I had a reliable source. - To whom the Soviets conveniently leaked the story. They knew that you or someone like you would pick it up, make a fuss and, with luck, there'd be a congressional investigation and perhaps appropriations would be held up. You see, the Russians don't suffer from the same restraints of our system when it comes to national security. - I know how you'd make the system work. - Tanner, you know nothing. You're guessing. And your guesses are pathetically short of the Mark. - Big brother Max knows everything. - Suppose I was to tell you that our enemies are capable of impairing rational thought. Of dismantling our willingness to defend our self, of disassociating whole societies from their value systems. - You mean they've got television as well? - We have such substances. It's only prudent to fear they do. We believe that your friends are in control of a Soviet network and that they have a list of agents whose task it is to release these substances on command. Now, I'm asking you as an American to help us to protect ourselves against them. - You want something from me. I want something from you. I want you on my programme. - Ag Reed. And if this turns out to be more CIA self-abuse, I'll have it out of you on the air. That's a promise. - I would expect that. I think Mr. Fassett is waiting for you to sign the paper. Comfort yourself with the thought that you never did have a choice. It's usually the case. - What is it you want me to do? - Just behave normally. You don't have to do anything. We do it all. In this world that you have entered, things are rarely as they seem. To us, an enemy agent is potentially our agent, if we can turn him. - Why don't you just have them arrested? - We don't want to arrest your friends. We want to turn them, one or all of them. In this you can help us, believe me. You shouldn't be so dramatic. It's only two days out of your life. - Am I getting old? Your not competing, Ginny, remember? - Yeah. - That's why you married me. - And you married me because... 'Cause I'm little less expensive than a Maserati. And easier to park. You left Ali? No, not yet. - Oh, good, I'm relieved. Do you wanna drink? Well, what's wrong, John? - I talked to Max. - Danforth? What are you gonna do to get rid of him? I know it doesn't mean anything. I know she's old enough to be your mother. - Don't tell me about business. All right? Okay. - I know how you feel. Believe me. - What's that, "omega"? Who's omega? Mrs. Hazeltine's uncle or somebody? Joe, what is that? What's going on? - Why Marsha? Why kill her? - It's a warning, I've seen their work before, it's kgb. - Oh, so what do I do? - You go home. - Just hide in the closet? What about the police? - I have everything under control. - The press is gonna be all over me. - I told you, Mr. Tanner, I have everything under control. Now let me play the beginning game, you play the middle game. Okay? - What's the trouble? - Can I see your licence, please? - Hey, I wasn't speeding, you know? I've given that up. You know, I've cut way back on speeding. I've cut, cut it way down. - Oh, I thought that was you. You write for TV, don't you? - Yeah, that's me. Yeah, I'm on my way to catch a plane, though. - Oh, don't worry, you'll make it. I like your stuff, Mr. Osterman. Only sometimes I think you tend to, ah, be a little strident, you know? - Strident? Oh, you're giving me a ticket for strident writing, are you? That means the death penalty for Beverly Hills parking violations is coming back, too, huh? - Have a nice day. - Yeah. - Bernie! - Hey, paisan. - Yeah. Doc. Somebody's on to us, huh? - Who the hell wouldn't be on to us? Look where we are. - Oh, now, wait a second. I control this place. I mean, those, ah, those guards you saw? They're mine. Those gates are locked. I mean, this is a natural place here. - This area is all right. - There's a good boy, eh? And what's your name, eh? What's your name? What's happening? - I'm... taking my wife and son out. - That's not very smart. The object of the exercise is to make everything seem as normal as possible. - I'm taking no chances. - We can protect them better here. How are you gonna explain the fact that they're gone? - Well, pm, I'll tell them we had a fight. Won't be hard to make that sound real. - I'm sorry, John. Just hang in, you'll get through it. Yeah? Where are you putting all these cameras? - Everywhere. The whole house will be covered. - Not in my bedroom. - Of course not. - This is frank. - That's a boy. Just one thing, John. I don't wanna come home to an empty house and find some kind of long, logical letter. You understand? If you're bailing out on me, tell me now. - I'm not. I'll get the tickets. - Hey, mister. We're looking for a place to stay. Mommy! - You know, we're looking for some place with a bridal change suite, you know, ah... - What the hell's going on? - Move over! I need your help, god damnit. Oh! - What is the matter with you? - That is my wife and son! Look out! - I'm gonna count to three! Let us go, just go. One! I'm telling you... Two. You let me out of here, you fucker, right now! - Oh, shit! - All right, get out! Come on, come on. Some honeymoon! Dumb, son of a bitch. Oh, honey! - Stupid idiot! - My god. Come on, let 'em go. Oh, my god. Honey. Come here. Hold me. Open your eyes, honey. Hey, take a breath. - Come on, then, son. Come on. - That's it. Take it easy. - Chris! - Okay. Huh? There's Chris. - There's a boy, come on. - Here. You all right? I should've listened to you. - Luckily, we had it bugged. But from now on, we do it my way, okay? You're gonna be all right, Mrs. Tanner. I'm fassett, FBI. We'll have you back home before you know it. Do you wanna ride in a helicopter, son? - Mm-h m. - Come on. What the fuck happened? - He's dead. - So you're telling me that that man didn't really mean to kidnap Steve and me? The FBI thinks he couldn't afford to be questioned. - The FBI. Magic little elves that drop right out of the sky. How come they happened to be there so quickly? - We're tailing him! God, I thought you were dead. - I'm not dead yet. - John. Time for a face-to-face. - I can't lie to Ali. - Practise. Look, I'm sending over a tape of your friends at one of their board meetings. - The kidnapping shows they know something. That's mikalovich protecting his investment, kgb. I'm certain that your friends knew nothing. But the closer you stay to the house till this is over, the better. No one's gonna get in, I promise you, except your guests. - We've been working on them. They're getting a little unglued. But you're gonna have to split one of them off. And you know which one you have the best chance of getting close to. Now, once you've made that contact, then we 're in business. - What if none of them break? - We'll think of something. - Are you enjoying this? - Let me show you something that I keep just in case I get to enjoying myself too much. You got your wife back from those bastards. Puts you way ahead of me. And you will be telling me you have to leave. - Hello, doctor. - Hello. - Yeah. - Is your back all right? - Yeah. - Hi. Hello. - Yeah. Somebody's on to us. Well, I'll tell ya. - Dick, who wouldn't. - Come in. They're here. Well? Come on, shake a leg. It's what you've been waiting for. Okay. - Everybody out of the pool. - Hey, champ, how are you? Let's see that left again, come on. Oh, keep it up. Come on, keep it up. - Raccoon. Hello, Christopher, look at you. Mm, you're getting big. - How are you? - Hello, darling. - Good to see you. Maybe he just wants to be cut in. I'll cut him in. In half. This area is all right. - Gentlemen, whoever's fingering us has got a lot of pull. Video hookups, phoney cops, the mails. Betty! Oh, Betty. And that's government, isn't it? So if it's the government, why haven't they stuck us before this? - Yeah. - Why haven't they busted us? How about your friend? The interviewer? - John Tanner? - He has contacts. He might have a motive. - He does! - No, no, what? - He's the king of the exposes! Self-righteous hypocrite. It's cocktail time! How dumb of me. - Hi, doctor. - Howdy. Same rooms? - Yeah, same rooms. - Okay, then we oughta cancel the weekend. No, I don't think we oughta cancel the weekend. John Tanner's a friend of ours, right? - He's a friend of ours. - Well, so let's go to our friend John Tanner's house and set him up. Fake bricks or whatever you have in here? Set him up. - How you doing, John? - How's your back? - How are you? - You know. Okay. - Hey, uncle Bernie, wanna go for a ride? - Huh? - Wanna go for a ride? - Sure, ride. Bike, yeah. - Gunga din, yes. And water boy, one of the great moments in literary history. Oh, refreshments. Oh, look, how beautiful. - All right. - Thank you. - How sweet. - A treat for the folks. - I got a toast. Here is to John Tanner kicking ass on TV. - Oh, yes. - Yes. - Here is to John Tanner kicking ass anywhere. Whoa! All right, let's hit it. - Here's to John Tanner's ass. You never stop, do you? - Not bad, not bad. Hey, what's the name of that guy that you grilled that day? Keeler, keever? What's his name? General...? - Keever. - General keever. Now, what I wanna know is why these people, a guy like that, would sit still for that shit? I wouldn't. No way. - Bernie? - Mm-hm? - I really like your moustache. Sort of makes me wanna curl up in it. - I lick the ends of it. Go to it, Ginny-Ginny. - She's serious. - You want some vitamins, Virginia? - What, pills? Oh yeah, that'd be good. - Put you right. - Here baby, here baby. - You want a vitamin, dick? - Ah, no thank you, I ah... I had mine this morning. - You certainly did, darling. This weekend could be fun. That was a nude thing. You go in wet, all right. Here comes the double fuck. All right! There he is. Oh, there! Whoa! Boy, he could swim. - Bernie! - Great. Wonderful stuff, you know? - Nice, Virginia. Ah, yes, there we are. - Virginia, what is it that you're wearing there? - Oh, isn't she cute? - I need a drink. Betty, you look great, look at you. You were very drunk that day, weren't you? - Need some help? - No, no. - Oh, Jesus. Look, honey. - She just loves doing that stuff, doesn't she? - Wait, wait! - John? - Time for a face-to-face. - Would anyone like more coffee? - No, interesting piece of film. - Could you roll that back to the beginning? - I'm gonna get a drink. - I mean right where John was... Exactly how much we took off. I'm gonna get a drink. - You kept it clean. You want a coffee? - When you get a chance, we must talk. I '/I meet you in the pool house. That was omega. He's on to us. - Come on. Come, bloody thing. Too early to start bribing friends. - State-of—the-art, damn it! The forecast calls for continued good weather through the weekend with our current civic centre temperature at 68 degrees. - Ah. Can I get you guys anything? Nightcap? - Look, I wanna know who the... - Joe. - What we'd like to know is who transferred the old movies onto videotape? - Oh, I had it done at the studio. Saves a lot of trouble. - And that sign at the end, ah, the omega? - Lab guy. Why? Is something up? - No, I thought they were nice. I like my walnuts that way. The air quality index is rated for fair throughout the, ah... I think I just had another, another little bulletin come in here... Ah, would you excuse me? - Oh. Gee, it was great seeing those movies again. - And steady, and relative humidity is ah, is - 20 degrees, falling to... - See you in the morning? - Yeah. - The air quality index... - Yeah, let's uh, let's take care of the ladies, huh? - Yeah, good night. - Good night, John. - Good night. - With gusts up to 15 miles per hour, levelling off to a gentle 5 - 8 miles per hour by... by breeze tomorrow where the Baromatica pressure is 30.18 and steady, um, the - with gusts of up to 15 miles per hour, levelling off to a gentle 5 - 8 miles per hour breeze tomorrow. And the barometric, ah, pressure is 30-point... And in the central areas it is possible that they will be just hanging in there. Um... - So. Why didn't we put it to him? - Because I believed him. Didn't know anything about omega. - Yeah, I believed him, too, I guess. - You did? - Maybe. - Maybe. - What, he's s-st-staring you right in the face. You didn't believe that crap about the lab. Look, it said omega. O-m-e-g-a, omega, do you...? - Won't be necessary. We rely too much on sight, don't you think? Appearances being what they are. - What's wrong? - Oh, no, nothing, nothing at all. You're doing very well. Just keep it moving along. Tomorrow night, shortly after dinner, I'll turn the TV on. Just watch their reactions to the programme. I think you'll find that one of your friends might indicate a willingness to confide in you. Okay? Who is it? Are you busy? - No. - Um, I heard about Marsha and I'm sorry. You must've been chewed up a lot. - Yeah. - I don't have to tell Ali, though. - No. - So what are you worried about? - I'm not worried. - Well, it's not the same old, light-hearted osterman of yesteryear, is it? - No. - Yeah. - Well, we all got problems. So who's your next victim on the show? - Maxwell Danforth. - Oh, yeah, big one. What did you have to give up to get him? You know, it's amazing to me how you invite these gentlemen on your show and then you rip them up and spit them out, you know? They keep coming back asking for more, I don't know. Why do you think people would do something like that? - It's a ball game. - No. No, maybe they thought they were right. I think everybody thinks they're right, deep down. - Don't we all? - No. You know, there's a principle I like to live by. The truth is a lie that hasn't been found out. Maybe you ought to bear that in mind. These are strange times, amigo. Why only survive? - Yeah. - Let's you and me survive them together. - Checking in, sir. - Thank you. - That exciting, huh? What's wrong? A lot of bad shit going on. - Well, maybe I can just help you forget about all that bad shit that's going on. Ow. - First, the gum. - Why? - You need to ask? - Wanna shtup? - I bet I could get a little... "Something" out of Mr. Tanner. I'd just coke him a little, stroke him a little. It's all for a good cause. - You know. I don't think that'll get it. - You're afraid of him, aren't you? Well, listen, darling, he's only a man. And what works for one, works for another. - You know something, Virginia? I'm tired of you talking through your nose. Talk to me, Bernie. - Feel better? Thanks. That was great. - Don't! - Don't grab me! - Throw it, dick. Get off my back, John! - Come on! - Throw it! - Okay. - Throw it! Dunk that sucker! - You know, Ali, your old man is really quite something. I wish I could offer you a better swap. Ah. Maybe I could give you dick on a three-to-one basis. What do you say? - Virginia, don't you ever get tired of playing the bitch in heat? - Come on, are we gonna play? - Let's play. - Okay. - Hey! What are you talking? - Don't hit me with the fuckin' ball. - It was a mistake. - Come on, Joe. Come on. - No, throw it! Stop it, all right? - That's it, Martini time. - Joe, come on! You got money on the game? Hey, come on, will you...? - Allow me. - Joe, come on! - Come on! - We got one more, come on! - It's just a game, remember? - Come on, Joe. - Yeah, but it's my game and I'm playing it. - Oh, "it's my game and I'm playing it". - Yeah. - Come on, just one more! Come on! Piss off. - Joe, what's wrong with you? That's good. Ah, let him work it off. I love watching them get into it. - Shall we sit here or talk? - No, let's talk. Why don't you tell us who done it, John? - Who's done what? - Well, it seems like some of the bad memories from the past are catching up to us, Ali. - Who's catching up with us? - Stop playing games. - I think that ah, dick is just... - What is this dick shit? - Let him speak for himself. - And I'm gonna speak for myself, and I'm telling you I'm not gonna put up with this anymore. - Try being more specific, Joe. - What are you talking about, specific? You know what the hell I'm talking about. - Why don't you try to get along a little better? I mean, after all, you are friends. - Why don't you just shut the fuck up? - Excuse me. - For Christ's sake, Virginia. - The investigator is trying to put these assholes through a few of his own hoops, right? - More than any other issue, more than the economy, more than crime and the streets, this country now in greater danger than ever before in its history. And that danger is the indifference of people like you indifferent to your responsibilities as citizens, tax evaders, traitors in the pay of foreign governments, seeking to destroy our defence budget. Citizens will laugh at the brush fires sweeping central and South America. Well, I warn you, my job is to destroy any threat to this nation. You who are guilty, look at me. Now while I'm not in a position to share much of this information with you, I think every American should know, know that I'm coming after you. That you will be found. I promise you that. - The son of a bitch is mind-fucking us. - If you men had a pair of balls between the bunch of you, you'd take this bastard outside and straighten his... Just one more word out of you, you... Ali, just calm down! - That's it, that's it, that's it. - Joe, come on, let's just go. - You okay? - No. Bravo, John Tanner. It's getting tricky now, isn't it? It's a mystery. Have you written the ending yet, John? I know that something's wrong, damn it. And either you tell me what it is, you tell me what I'm mixed up in, or I'm leaving with Chris right now. - You can't leave me now. I need you here. - Mom! Dad! - What? - The fridge! What is it? - What is it? - What's wrong? In the fridge! - What's wrong? - Bastards! Sick bastards. I'm gonna... Joe, I'm gonna kill you! - John! - John, let go of him! - Let go! - Leave him alone! - Why don't you tell us what happened, John? Bastards. I wanna know... Who did this? - It's not real, John. - It's a fake. - It's not a very funny joke. That is sick. - Why are you doing this to us? - I want you out by tomorrow morning. Please? Oh, he's fine. We'll find him. He's outside. - It's a ketchup bottle. It's not even a good fake. - Maybe it'll be gone in the morning. - We better be gone in the morning. - Early. - It's okay, come on. Listen to me. Now you stay here and do as your mom tells you. I'm gonna find him, okay? - Dad, I'm scared. - Come on. You're gonna be fine. Lie down. - John, what are you doing to us? - I'm gonna go for help. You make sure you lock the door, please. - Kelly, Tanner's coming out. Let him through. Don't want him wandering around out there at night. - Well, what are we gonna do? - Pack. I'm getting out of here. Got any brains, you'll do the same. - Right. - Fassett's waiting. - Follow me. - You don't need the gun, Joe. - It's Ali. - Don't worry about it. I mean, she knows something. - Chris, here. - Come on. Quit screwing around, Ali. Open the door. - Get away from my door, Joe cardone. - Would you put that gun away? - Look, I'm tired of getting stepped on. - He's right. - She knows something. I'm gonna find out what. - Somebody please tell me what's going on. - Yeah, we're getting out of here now. Come on, Joe. Come on. Come on, Joe! Joe! - Get your bow. - All right, fassett. That's me, I'm finished. I've had it. I want out. - And where might "out" be? - I'm fed up! - Do what you have to do. Arrest them, I don't care. Just get them out of my house. - We have a single male adult out there. Osterman. Terminate on contact. - Son of a bitch. We've got one dead. Grab what's necessary, that's all. Come on, move it. Move it! Go on. - Why don't you get them? - There's no need. They're going nowhere. All this activity and for nothing. - Yes, that was nice. - Wait a minute. - Wait! Camper, come on. - He's got my motor home. The keys in there? Yeah. - I didn't leave my keys in it. There's no need to worry, John. Everything is under control. They're just on a very long leash. What about Bernie? He can take care of himself. - Who's pulling your strings? - Now, you must go home now. They're pinning osterman down at the far end. And straight home now. Remember, out there you're a single male adult, too, you know? Kelly, follow him out of this area and eliminate him. See where you're going? Mm-hmm. - Just wait, son of a bitch. - You want me to finish this now or shall we talk? - You traitor. - I'm gonna kill you like a chicken. But I'm not gonna let you die so ignorant, John. Now what is this traitor bullshit? We're just saltin' some money away for good times, that's all. Now it ain't legal, but it sure as hell ain't traitorous. I'm gonna let you up, John, 'cause I want you to talk to me. But if you make a move for this bat, you'll be wearing it in your ass for a month. - Do you understand? Good. I'm awfully tired. - Where's my dog? - Not in there. Who's in the Van? - A CIA man called fassett. He says you, dick, and Joe are working for the Russians. - That's bullshit. - I saw a film on you talking to the kgb. I saw you make a deal with a guy called Petrov. You remember Petrov, the independent film producer? To help create such conditions, or are you just a coffee-house revolutionary? - No. No, I'm not a revolutionary. What I am is a nihilistic anarchist who lives on residuals. So money would help form your decision? - Don't you feel better now that you know that all your old friends are just tax evaders after all? Or are you just a little disappointed? - You were setting us up. Why? - We're in prime killing time. All it took was to have my wife murdered while my employers watched on closed-circuit TV. I t's just another episode in this whole snuff soap opera we're all in. - Switch it off, John. - You know better than that, Bernie. It's your business, both of you, addicting people so they can't switch off. - Smash the set. - Smash it! Switch this one off. - What's the rush, Joe? - I got a lot of things to clear up. - You know what we need right now? A spaceship. Come right over those trees, invite us in. J“ Jesus loves me j“ j” this I know j” j“ for the Bible j“ - Betty, get out there! - Joe, Joe, get out! Virginia, come here. Do you see what I see? - Betty, get out! - They can't hear us. - Joe, get out! - Things could be worse, right? - Right. Oh, I see. You want to send them a message. Just wait. - Betty, get out. Come here. Come here. - What the hell have you got all over your face, Virginia? - Come here. - Come on. - Get out of the camper now. - I don't wanna be in the country when it comes down. I think you will find that when the time comes, you will be able to leave the country very quickly, indeed. - Joe. - This is our deal, Petrov. Nothing happens to Tanner. Your partners don't wanna postpone this. You've already been consulted. - Just remember, we're calling the shots. - What the hell is he trying to pull? - I don't know but we better get out of here. J“ Jesus loves me j“ j” this I know j” j“ for the Bible... j“ - we're all gonna die. - Get out! - Come on. Let's go, come on. - Betty, get out! - Come on! Move now! - Come on! - Come on. Betty, come on! Betty, come on, damn it! J“ for the Bible j“ j“ tells me so j" J“ little ones to him belong j' J' we are weak but he is strong j” - And then there were two. You crazy, murderous bastard. He's mad. - Try to think of them as fleas on a dog that gets hit by a stolen car driven by a drunk teenager whose girlfriend had just given him the clap. It will help your perspective. All agents move in to execute termination procedure. Repeat execute termination procedure, all agents. - Have you got a gun? - No. - You got a gun? I - no! '- Agent Kelly, they're going out of the backdoor. Stop them. It'd be nice if we had a weapon. I have bows. - Oh, bows, that's keen. - In the bedroom, go get 'em! - Shh. - Kelly? - Kelly, do you read me? Kelly? Oh, god, what's the matter with this thing? - Kelly, watch it! - Rotten commies! Kelly? Can you read me? - Get the - get the gun! Do you read me? Kelly! - I know what to do. - The pool house. - They're making for the pool house. - Oh, my god. - No! God, wait! - Sure. - I had bows in here! - Is this what you want? - Shh! - I'm ready - oh, that's good. You're gonna shoot mice with that, right? See you later, bye. - Bernie! Bernie! - There's someone out here with a bow. They got agent brick. - Damn. - Blue-eyed bitch. Mrs. Tanner. Just keep them in the pool. Don't move. Mikalovich, can you read me? There's gasoline behind the pool house. Use it. Agent donner, do you read me? Keep them in the pool. Repeat, keep them in the pool till further orders. You're gonna be all right, I'm fassett, remember? FBI. Do you want to ride in a helicopter, son? Come on. Chris? - Mrs. Tanner. I'm fassett, remember me? I don't think we'll need the bow, huh? Gonna take a little trip, the three of us. Come on. Come on. Come on. - I think we got him! Don't walk away. - Uh-huh, right. Ah, next time, I'm gonna wear my own clothes, babe. Strident son of a bitch. John. Worshipping graven images again, John? Be of good cheer. Salvation is at hand. John, I don't want you to do anything wrong. I love you. - I'll be in touch. - What the fuck's going on? He found out Tanner's friends were funnelling money out of the country. Then he uncovered their bag man, mikalovich, and he tamed him. Then he fabricated a kgb dossier on him. - I told you he was a very skillful operative. - But why? Why did he make us try to believe omega existed? - Stennings, stennings. The existence of omega has not been disproved. Don't you understand that? Omega is as real as we need it to be. We have enough evidence to convince any congressional committee of that. One thing our enemies fear is that someone who knows them for what they are might come to power in this country. And they're right to be afraid. Now you find fassett! Before that damn show tonight. Stennings, give me central control. - Repeat. - Launch all helicopters. Launch all helicopters. Codeword, omega. Seek out and destroy. Roger. Good. I approve this list of questions you've submitted. And I'm glad to see that you acknowledge that you are bound by the security articles you've signed. We're in accord. It should be an interesting evening. - Um... Just kinda wondering how we got in this mess. - It's called being programmed. Good evening, welcome to face-to-face. The title of our programme tonight is Alpha to omega, the first to the last. First, we talk to Maxwell Danforth. Mr. Danforth, tell us your policy, please, regarding the present Soviet missile buildup. - Take three. - This is the end of the 20th century in which we live and no nation can expand further without coming into conflict with its neighbour. We are being forced into playing a game in which there will have to be a winner and the Soviets intend it will be them. - And you, sir, have a solution to all this? - Our people must be educated to the realities of this crisis. We have always been ignorant of our destiny, and yet our destiny is simple. Not easy, mind you, but simple. Our destiny is to survive. - Do you have ambitions to be president? - That's a very pointed question, Mr. Tanner. And my answer is no. My ambition is to continue to serve my country with all of my talents and energies. However, if it is my destiny to be called on by the American people to assume that exalted office, I should feel compelled to accept. I have always sought out my country's enemies and foiled their designs against us. As president of these United States, I would continue to do so. - At this point, I 'd like to introduce a man until recently employed by the CIA. While at the same time, moonlighting as kgb agent. A man who has worked closely with Maxwell Danforth on a covert operation that cost the lives of four innocent people. A man who represents the hidden side of Maxwell Danforth's power. - Central control? - Ladies and gentlemen, Lawrence fassett. - This is stennings. Red alert, he's surfaced. Mr. Fassett, what can you tell us about the director of the CIA? - I know Maxwell Danforth very well. Ah... He killed my wife two years ago. Not with his bare hands, of course, but... The danforths of this world don't murder in that fashion. - Launch omega termination. - Immediate launch omega termination section. - Now, calm down, be quiet. - They make telephone calls, write memos. Use jargon words like terminate and eliminate. - Erase. - Location confirmed, sir. Get me network control now. This is priority, get it... So that their mouths don't have to touch words like murder. Or kill. To you out there, my fellow Americans. The man you have just seen is a Russian agent, and a killer of innocent people. And with the connivance of John Tanner, he has been allowed to appear here and to make allegations against me, which he has no possible means of proving. - Take one. - This piece of film was taken by CIA surveillance cameras. The woman is Mrs. Lawrence fassett and the killers were kgb. - It is true. It is true that I have killed innocent people. But then my guilt is not in question. But the guilt of this man is. And it will continue to be so until he is... Exposed. A man that is prepared to use the power of his office and all its techniques in order to further his own personal ambition. - Any comments, Mr. Danforth? - Comment? Yes, I have a comment. You and this man fassett are traitors. An archaic term, but it fits. When I realised what you had done by bringing this murderer onto your programme, I was shocked. But now I'm glad. 'Cause you have illustrated, better than I ever could, exactly how dangerous our enemies are. And by their presence here, they bear witness to my assertion that not until we have a leadership in this country committed to rooting out this disease, not until then, can we have a healthy nation. I say to you all, all of you watching, without a healthy america, we live in a hopeless world, indeed. Well, why don't you kill me, then, Max? Use your powers. Show your audience how you're going to save them from what lies inside each of them. Kill me, Max, and pretend that you're killing their fear. Be the new saviour risen in the hour of need. - Don't think you won't be found, fassett. And don't think you won't be exterminated. You have my word on that, you hear? Do you hear me? Take three. - Where's my wife? All eyes, pull back. Widen out, two. Oh, this is nice. Okay, get ready, one. Just get eyes, get eyes on Tanner, one. Take three. - What you just saw, was in a way, a life-sized video game. You saw a liar talk to a killer and you couldn't tell them apart. And who cares? It's only television. - And hold it there. - As you all know, television programmes are just the fillers between attempts to steal your money. So if you wanna save some, switch off. It's simple. It's done with a hand and what is left of your free will. This is the moment. My bet is you can't do it. Go ahead and try. Am I still on? Cue Tanner, take one. Well, why don't you kill me, then, Max? Use your powers. Show your audience how you're going to save them from what lies inside each of them. Kill me, Max, and pretend that you're killing their fear. Be the new saviour risen in the hour of need. - Don't think you won't be found, fassett. And don't think you won't be exterminated. You have my word on that, you hear? Do you hear me? What you just saw, was in a way, a life-sized video game. You saw a liar talk to a killer and you couldn't tell them apart. And who cares? It's only television. As you all know, television programmes are just the fillers between attempts to steal your money. So if you wanna save some, switch off. It's simple. It's done with a hand and what is left of your free will. This is the moment. My bet is you can't do it. Go ahead and try.
