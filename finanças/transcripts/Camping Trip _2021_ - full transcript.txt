Okay, I get to choose the track now. That's what you were just saying. No, I'm gonna choose the track. I... I get to listen to the music, okay? He's supposed to be here. Where... where the hell is he right now? Okay. I'm going to go get him. One sec. Enzo! Enzo! Hey, babe, have you seen my fishing rod? And not the one between my legs. Just beside the tent, and you would have known if you had helped me pack the car. Love you, too. Hold on. What's up, motherfucker? I've missed you. Hey, hey, hey! Stop that, pendejo. I told you not to do that. My neighbors are watching. So? Turn the music down. It's too loud. You can't do that anymore. I don't wanna get a fucking ticket. Who the fuck cares? We're loud. I'll pay the fucking ticket. Okay, man? I missed you, too, you fucking monkey. Come on. And put your mask on. Okay, so what do you got? - Hey, Coco! - Hey, beautiful. I've got six boxes of beer each. - How have you been? - I'm good. Still haven't killed him? No, not yet, but I have a feeling that I will soon. Oh, my God, I can't wait to hug you. I've missed that French accent. So did I with your English one. Oh, Enzo, can you put that purple bag up front, please? ...I... I brought, like, a mini bear-trap... Hello? Can you hear me? - Huh? - The purple bag. Oh. Yeah, sure. My God, I swear he has got more and more deaf over the years since we got together. Yeah, I think I have to call Ace at least 20 times when he's in his man cave. Ugh, I hate it when they do that. So, did your work start back? Uh, no, not yet. And I heard I might get cut off. - Are you serious? - Yeah. Tough times are ahead. Even Ace got cut off. Oh, I didn't know it was that bad. Yeah, but don't bring it up. He gets all sensitive and it hurts his ego. So, what are you guys gonna do? Don't know yet. He says he'll find something quick, but... I don't know. What about you guys? Um, yeah, I work. I... I can't work for another four weeks, the government have said. You know, got to respect the guidelines. But, anyway, Enzo works from home now. He's started to reduce some of his hours. And it's our only income at the moment. Well, at least you have an income. - ...$1,500 fine. - Are you fucking serious? - $1,500 fine for a party? - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Did you find out who snitched? No, I didn't, but I got a pretty good idea who did. Don't look now. But do you see my neighbors to my right? Yeah. They're, like, always spying on me. I'm pretty sure, like, they're spying on us right now. They're so suspicious about everything. Anyways, tell me about you. You got cut off, man? Yeah. Yeah. Fuck. Fuckin' sucks. Holy shit. Okay, what happened? - Covid. - Oh, fuck. Okay. Got an email talking about expenses being too high, cost of business, blah, blah, blah, blah, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. Yeah, and I got cut off. - I'm out job hunting again. - Ah, that sucks. Hey, um... - can I ask you something? - Mm-hmm. Look, I hate to ask, but... Do you think you can lend me, like, $2,000? I'm kind of scrambling right now. Holy shit! Two Gs? Uh... I'm not sure. We're pretty short right now. But, uh... I can manage to lend you 1,000. But you can't say anything to Polly, or else she's gonna cut my balls. We wouldn't want that. Okay. I'll make your transfer when we're on the road. Thanks, man. I really appreciate it. I'll totally tag you back when I'm back on my feet again. Ah, no worries. Get back on the job hunt. - Find a job in no time. - Mm-hmm. You know me. Who wouldn't wanna hire this? Don't worry about it. You'll end up back... What are you two bitches plotting? Uh, nothing. We're just, uh, talking about, you know, uh... all the situation, and, uh, the neighbors are watching, and the Covid stuff. - Bullshit. You know. - Okay. So, are we all set and ready to leave, then? Let's do it. I can't wait to be on the road. Okay, then. What are we waiting for? Wait, wait, wait. You ready? Camping trip! Nice! About time! My butt is killing me. Oh, yeah. Help me with this? Okay. All right. You got it. Okay.. - One, two, three. - Yep. You lift it? Oh! - Nice. Like that. - Okay. Whee! Did I tell you about the, uh... The biggest fish I ever caught with this pole right here? Enzo was there. He saw it. - Uh-huh. - Yeah. Hey, honey. Hey, beautiful. - Ready? - Okay. One, two, three, yeah. Okay, it was a bit lighter before. Oh, wait. Fuck. So, is that it? Uh... Yeah, that's it. Hey, nice seeing you, Coco. Same. It's been a while. - How've you been, Polly? - Yeah. I'm fine, Ace. - Thanks for asking. - Good seeing you again. Come here, you. I wanna hug. - You. - You. That feels so good. - Missed you, man. - You look beautiful. You look beautiful. - Feels good. - Yeah. You have no idea how long we've just been cooped up... Hey, I've been meaning to ask you. How's your grandma doing? Oh, she's fine, I guess. Better than she was, but, you know... not fully herself yet. And I honestly don't think she ever will be. Must be so much harder recovering by herself. Yeah, I... I try to call her as much as I can, but it's just not the same, you know? How are you feeling about it all? It's heartbreaking, honestly, and... I think everyone is kind of feeling anxious. Like, my anxiety has never been this bad. Yeah, no, I know what you mean. I'm definitely drinking - more than usual. - Same. I'm considering a... A career change as a sommelier. No way. Have you seen this mess? I need you. Yeah, I wasn't going to say anything, but, girl, this is not you. Coronavirus! Shut up, Ace! There might be people around. Babe, there's no one around for miles. No, last time you said that, the cops came. Is that the time he was arrested? Yep. My boy's tough, man. He went to the slammer! Enzo. I'm sorry. Mr. Ace. Could you kindly turn down your volume? Because you might disturb the trees and the fish in the lake. Mr. Enzo. I shall turn it down for the trees. - What? - What if Coco's right? What if someone heard us and comes here? Still gonna laugh then? Okay. I'm sorry to have laughed. I mean, we are sorry to have laughed. But what Ace is telling you is the truth. There's no one in miles of this place. I used to come here when I was a kid with my family, and a couple times with Ace. There's no one. The cellphone don't work here, because there's no network, you understand? Wait, what the hell? There's no... How the hell am I supposed - to post on my Instagram? - Babe. We don't need that material shit here. Us, now... is real. This present is real. Not that fake social media shit. I like it when you talk that way. Mm-hmm. I love this place so much. It completely disconnects you from the outer world. But at the same time, it connects you with your own roots as a human being. - I love you. - I love you, too. What? What? Ah, come on, let's go make dinner before you guys need a room. Or a tent! Come on. Coronavirus! Shut up, Ace. There might be people around. There's no one around for miles. The last time you said that, the cops came. My boy's tough, man. He went to the slammer! Enzo. One. What are you guys having? Do you want wine? Wine? Anyone? - Camping trip! - Yeah! Everybody, friendship. Friendship. - To friendship. - And fuck Covid. - Risk, risk, risk... - Rest. See? You see? That's... that's why he's... That's why he's my best friend. Stand in line. Excuse me! Thank you. Do you want to take over? Do you want me to cut it for you? No, you... You cut it if you want. - I think you've got it. - No, no, no. Stop. Okay, okay. You want a hot dog? Uh, not a hot dog, the bread? I think we need a sharper knife. - The buns. - Yeah, yeah. So, then we hear... And here's the catch, okay? You guys ready for the scary part? Fuck no, I'll have a heart attack. Oh, come on, it's good to have your blood pressure rise every now and then. Don't start with me, Ace. You know I hate it when you do that. Just take a chill pill, babe. - Oh, my God. - Okay, okay. We get it. Let him finish. Thank you, love. So, like I was saying. Here's the catch. Where the sound came from, I should see it in front of me. But I don't. Understand? It should be five feet in front of me, but it's not, so... I point my flashlight in the direction of the sound, and I say, "Who's there? I am light!" I hit my chest just to pump myself up. Meanwhile, my ex is in the car, all scared. And she's saying to me, "Enzo, come back in the car and just leave." So, I go back to the car, open the lights, and point it in the direction where the sound came from. And I say again, "Who's there? I am light." Okay. And now the people hiding in the woods are probably laughing their asses off. - Shh! - No, no, no, no. You're right, bro. You're right. If there was people in the woods, they would have been probably laughing by now. But there was nothing. Not one word. And, suddenly, we hear... So, me and my ex, we look at each other and we say, "What the hell is that?" And she says to me, "Is that a sort of gorilla monkey?" So, we waited 30 minutes for the sound to come back. But it never did. So, we left. And where was this? Here! Oh, my God. You are so mean. You... hey, you know what? I've got an idea. Back to back shots. Back to back shots. Oh! Shots! Finish it! No, no, not another sex question. Why don't we go in the more intellectual one? Like... do you think everything will go back to normal? You know, with the Covid and everything. Are you serious? Is... is that your question? No, no, no, no. Find another one. No, no, no, no. I'm actually also curious. You always have an interesting opinion. And you're not allowed to lie. Ace, come on, man. Help me here. Don't pull me into this. I'm with the girls. Rules are the rules, man. Okay. So, you want the truth, right? Yeah. Fine, okay. But, um, you have to promise me that you're not going to get frustrated or mad. - Promise? - I promise. I promise. I promise. Okay. Hmm. So, how can I say this? No. No, I don't think it's going to go back... "normal" like they say. Wha... why? Because before, it wasn't normal. Look, I... I... I don't want to be a pessimist, but... you do realize that before, we were over-consuming, over-eating, over-exploiting, over-polluting... I mean, you do realize that the world was sick before, don't you? And then I'm going to give it to the virus. It showed us that we were doing so many wrong things. Like how society is today. Yeah, it's all work-work-work, pay-pay-pay. - Like zombies. - Exactly. I mean, is that what really life is about? We don't see it pass? And now, with the pandemic going on, we see the true, real nature of people and what they're going through. Yeah, I've seen people fight over masks, food, toilet paper. It's insane. So, you don't have even just a little bit of hope that things are going to go back to normal? No. No, no, no. That's not what I'm saying, Polly. I'm just saying that things will change and we have to be ready for it. Because there will be people that won't be ready for it. That's it. I mean, look. I know that I'm going to be ready for it. We're going to be ready for it. The question you have to ask yourself is... are you going to be ready for it? You know what? Yeah, and... I hate to admit it, but it's probably for the best, what's happening. But I think right now, we should savor each moment we have together, because we never know if we're going to be able to camp with each other again. This will be the best weekend ever. And I just wanna thank you for being who you are with us. I'm out.. - I'm not sure. - On the table. - Oh! - Coco, are you okay? Let me see your hand. It looks good. Come on, Billy. Let's do this. Uh. Goddamn keys. Covid game ain't no joke. Come on, Billy. We got a lot of work to do. Don't give it up 'til I say so. Don't fuck it up this time. - Got it? - Yeah. Got it. Let's check the car. All right. Come on, Billy boy. Let's blaze. There you go. Uh, where do you think you're going? I think Enzo said something about a rock beach, - or something. - Okay. And is there, like, a lot of sun where I can tan? - Yes, of course. - Okay. - Do you want a tea? - Yes! Oh, my God, it's so nice. Yeah. Good morning. Oh! Good morning, beautifuls. Now, how was your night? Hmm? Yeah, we're good, thank you. We were just talking about going to one of the rock beaches you mentioned yesterday. Yeah, sure, uh, I think it's around 30 minutes. - And we have to take a canoe. - Okay. Aw. He doesn't wanna go in the canoe. No. That sounds good. Oh, my God. Ace! Can you put some pants on? Didn't we all just have sex? You guys have seen me like this before. Besides, this is... au naturel. Oh, my God! Ace! I swear, sometimes... What did I say? Nothin', bro. Come on. Put some shorts on and let's go to the rock beach. Awesome. - After I get a breakfast beer. - Yeah, sure. Ah... - And don't forget four for me. - Ah. One left. You lose. Hey, have you seen my sunglasses? Uh, yes, love, they're, uh... in the violet bag. Get on board, brother. All right. You want me to get in first? Yeah. Go ahead. I'm holding you. What a gentleman. I think I'm gonna fall out. Let me put it this way: you'll know if you're sinking. Are you ready? - Ready. - Yeah. Let's go. - Awesome. - Whoo! Nice push, sir. Whoo! Oh, my God. Huh, wow. - Is this it? - Yeah. Oh, wow, it's so cute. This is pretty nice, eh? Oh, yes. Awesome. Yeah, it is. Did you check the ingredients? Yeah. I made sure. I made sure when I got it. Exactly. You made sure. Oh! Oh! I love you. - I'm such an asshole. - Yeah. Yeah, you are. - It was illegal. - It was legal. - It was legal. - Always get my back. No, I didn't. We're not talking about that time. Hey! How ya doin', Doc? Can you, please, gentleman, respect the six feet? And I specifically asked you guys to wear masks, so where are they? There's a frickin' pandemic happening out there. People are dying from it. What are you guys thinking? Fuckin' Christ, I cannot breathe in this shit. What the fuck? We're in the middle of the woods here for fuck's sakes. Take your mask off. I need to see your face. Well, back off. - You're late. - Yeah. Took my time, making sure nobody was following me. Being safe. You know what I mean. Well, next time, just be on time, got it? The people I work for have no time to waste. So, did you bring what I want? Yeah. You got the money? - Yeah. - So? Where is it? First, let me verify the merchandise. Please, just drop it right here. Please. Much obliged. So? Everything's there. You're a happy camper now. So, hand over the money, buddy. Just wait a minute. I just need to double check everything's on the list. So, just please, wait right here, I'll be right back. I'm tryin' to be nice. Now give me the money, or I'll blow your brains out. Okay, let's just all calm down here. I'll give you the bag. Hey, hey, hey, hey. This is a detonator that will blast the ink I booby-trapped in that bag of money. Now, all I need to do is just press this button, and your money is useless. So, let me just go make sure everything's on the list. I'll come right back, remove the trap, so everybody can go home safe. Deal? You got five minutes. Why'd you let him go? I had no choice. He rigged the bag. But how do you know that? You saw the fucking detonator. What the fuck did you want me to do, heh? But why didn't you ask him to open the bag so we could see it? How can you be so sure he wasn't trying to screw us? Okay, Billy. You open the bag. That's not what I'm saying, Orick. - What I'm sayin'... - Billy! Open the fuckin' bag. I won't tell you twice, now. It's your funeral. Motherfucker! - Fucking told ya. - Fuck. Let's go get this son of a bitch. Damn fucking straight. Holy shit, honey. I swear you get better every year. Thanks, love. Wouldn't wanna piss her off. Maybe she should teach me, then I can kill you when you get on my nerves. Oh, my God. Come on, Billy, get him! Hey, Doc! Yeah. So, you thought you could screw me, huh? Now, listen, shithead. Give me the money and I'll let you live. Wait, wait, wait, wait! You fucking prick! Where's the fucking money? Wait, please, please, let me sp... Stop! - No, don't. Please. Stop. - Where's our fuckin' money? No, please, stop, stop! Please, stop! Please, stop! Billy, Billy, let me handle it. I... I... I hid it in a different bag. It's somewhere else. Hey, look at you. You'll never find it without me. Yeah, well, listen to me carefully. All right? You still wanna see your family and loved ones? Hey. I'm so sorry. I panicked. I fucked up. With the virus spreading around and... and... and the market going to hell, I... I know. Please, listen to me. Listen to me. I know I can do so much more with this money. I... I... I can develop my own vaccine. I... I... I... I can save people. It'll make billions. I'm the best shot. I'm the best doctor you got. You gotta hel... You gotta help me out. You gotta let me go, please. You two know... you have no idea who you're dealing with. Of course not. You know nothing. You... you... you don't even have the intellect for it. You're just... you're just a bunch of fuckin'... Two fuckin' brainless clowns. Clowns? Fuck you, man. No, no, no, no. Wait. It's... it's... It's a bit of a tough... What the fuck was that? I don't know. Did that come from the camp? Should we go and see? What the fuck, Orick? - You killed him? - So what? Told him not to fuck with me. Why? So you could fuck with both of us? We're in deep fuckin' shit, man. Someone's gonna notice he's missin'. They're gonna call the cops and I can't go to fuckin' jail, man. Calm the fuck down. We're not goin' to jail. We need to find the money, all right? We'll be free as a bird. No one will ever know what happened here. Come on, Billy. Search the body. All right. Come on, let's start with the car. - Okay. You got it, Enzo? - Yeah. Hold on, we're here. Go ahead. Okay. Fuck. Where the fuck is it? Maybe if you hadn't've killed him. Shut the fuck up, Billy. Don't even think of saying it. I swear I'll kick the shit out of you. So, what do we do then? If we can't get this money by tomorrow, we're fuckin' dead. We're fuckin' dead, Orick. You understand that? I fuckin' hear ya. Let me think for a second. Holy Jesus! Fuck! Shit. Ah, fuck. You guys! Guys... guys, come fuckin' see this. Hey, that was fun, eh? It was a lot of fun. Yeah, I told you would like it at the rock beach. Hey, guys! God, what does he want now? Probably, show his penis again. I have never met someone so obsessed with their dick. - I know. - Guys! It's probably nothing. - What is it? - You gotta come see this. Ooh, it looks to be more important than it is. Oh, well, I will chop it off if it's nothing important. Why did you went to pee so far, man? So, what do you want to show us beside your dick, man? Least he's got shorts on. So, what is it? Holy Jesus fucking Christ. That's what I fuckin' said. Is he dead? Well, what does it look like, genius? How the hell am I supposed to know? - I'm not a doctor, are you... - Okay, okay, shut up. Shut up, just two seconds, okay? Let me go check. Yeah. He's dead, all right. The... Those are gunshot wounds. Fuck does that mean? Is there a killer in the woods? I don't know. We need to call the police. Yeah. Let's go back to the campsite. Okay, so, we call the cops, and what do we say? Oh, hell no. They're gonna see a dead body and think we did it. I say we just split. But if we leave the crime scene, we could be convicted of fleeing, or negligence, or maybe even accomplice to murder. Are you saying we might go to jail? I don't know, I'm not a lawyer. I'm panicking right now. Hey, hey, calm down. Calm down just a second, okay? Nobody is going to jail. We did nothing wrong. Yeah? You think the cops are gonna see it that way? They're gonna see a dead body and they're gonna pin it on us, okay? I say we get the fuck out of here. Yeah, I'm tired of your stupid calm shit. There's a fucking dead body out there, and you're talking like if it was nothing. Okay. Okay. That's... that's enough, okay? There's no need to have a go at him. Things are bad enough as it is. We do not need to be fighting as well. Can I explain my plan now? - Yeah. - Yeah. Okay, so, this is what I suggest. We pack our things, and we leave here. Since we don't have any network, we call so... we call the cops when we have some. And then, we tell them the truth. That we were walking in the woods and we saw the dead guy. Okay? It's as simple as that. It's honest. It's the truth. And we are going to be fine. Okay? So, let's go pack our things and we'll be on our way. Agree? - Yeah. - Agree. As long as we get the hell out of here. Perfect. Oh, my God, you guys. You guys, come and look at this. What... Oh, my God. This is real and legal. Oh, my God. Holy, we're fucking rich. Oh, my God, this is gonna solve all our problems. I told you, babe. I told you it was gonna work out for us. I know you did. Oh, God, this is amazing. You guys. There has to be, like, a million dollars in here. That is enough money for us to do whatever we want. Yeah, and we're all gonna split it 50-50. - Yeah. - Yeah. No, no, no, no, no, no, we're not. - Sixty-forty. - No. Okay, whatever, 70-30. Bud, that's my final offer. Ace, you're going too low. Wh... What? It was his idea to bring us here. If he wants the bigger share, that's his prerogative, okay? No, no, no. Don't touch it! Nobody is taking this money, okay? We're going to give it back. We're going to give it to the police. - Fuck that. - Are you crazy? What's wrong, Enzo? Why don't you wanna keep the money? I think that this money comes from the dead guy that we found, and it's only gonna bring us trouble, okay? Okay, stop, what are you talking about? I found this near the dead body. Oh, my God. This says, "It's the final results of a phase three testing for a potential vaccine." This is worth fucking billions. Holy shit, we are insanely fucking rich. - Oh, my God! - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What... Do you really think this kind of money is left like that? Who the fuck cares? What if you're wrong and then no one actually cares about this money? You wanna call the cops and give it to them so they can keep it for themselves? Don't get me wrong. I completely understand that you need this money because you're past due on your debts, and all the Covid-19 situation, that doesn't help. We got overdue payments? Yeah. On the house and the car. Well, now I really want the money. And I know that you, Enzo, are also in debt because you could only lend me one thousand dollars instead of two. Is that true? Did you lend him money without consulting me? Answer me. Yes, I did. I'm... I'm sorry. I was just waiting one moment... How much are we in debt? For fuck's sake, Enzo, just tell me. Tell me, how much are we in fucking debt? 150K, okay? I'm sorry, I didn't want to talk to you that way. I just didn't want you to worry about it. I know that you could sell this formula to one of your contacts with no problem. And it would actually help the planet. So, for once, can you just put aside your morals. Because if you don't take that money, I will, and I don't care what you think. - Wait a minute, Polly. - What? Okay. Okay. We'll keep the money. And the envelope? Yes. And the envelope. So, where is it, Billy? - It's here somewhere. - Goddammit. I've got an idea. Huh? Hey. Hey, hey, hey, wa... wait. I don't think you should turn that on too loud. What? We just found a million dollars, maybe millions more. We're in the middle of the woods with our loved ones, our best friends. Enzo, man, just relax and enjoy the moment for once. Come on. Okay. Just for once, eh? Listen, listen, listen. Wonder what that excitement's all about? Hey, come on, Billy. Let's go check it out, man. Come on, man. Woo-hoo! Yeah! Oh, sorry. Didn't mean to scare you. Can we help you? Yeah, my name is Orick. This is Billy. Our car broke down by the road. Uh, our friend went looking for help, but hasn't come back. Maybe, uh, you saw him pass by? We haven't seen anyone. Isn't that strange? I'm sure he went this way. Maybe he passed, and, uh, you guys weren't there. We're here since yesterday. Like he said, we haven't seen nobody. - I'm sorry. - That's fine. Listen, is it okay if we stay here with you guys? If you guys don't want, we'll understand, but, uh, we just don't know when he'll be back. We don't wanna wait standing by the road. Right, Billy? Yeah, he's taking his sweet-ass time. - Yeah, sure. - Hey. - Go ahead, sit down. - Thanks. What the fuck, man? Why'd you say they could join us? What were you thinking? I didn't want to look suspicious. It fucking complicates things. By the way, thanks for the hospitality. - Yeah, no problem. - Yeah. Listen, uh, I don't like to ask you this, but, uh, do you mind if we stay here for the night? Or 'til our friend gets back? I don't know. Listen, I'd really appreciate it. You know, uh, I'm a big guy. I don't wanna sleep in the car. Look, Orick, uh, I understand, but we don't know you. And I think your friend is scaring the girls, and we don't like that. All right, I'll make you a deal. You take care of your people and I'll take care of mine. This way, everything is going to be under control. After tomorrow, I'll be on my way. That fair enough for ya? Yeah, but just for tonight, okay? Hey, thanks. Hey, Ace, come and pick out some wood with me? - For the fire? - Ace. Come. Yeah. Sure, man. Hey, Billy, why don't you go help them, will you? No, no, it's okay. Me and Ace can handle it, thanks. Hey, come on. This way, we do our part. I insist. We're just a big family here, right? Okay, fine. Come then. No problem, brother. - What did you wanna say? - Shh. Is he looking at us? - No. - Keep picking up the wood while we're still talking, okay? O... Okay. These are the people that killed the guy that we found in the woods. What? You're fucking with me. Shh. Not so loud, man. He might hear you. Yes, I'm almost 100% certain. I just need to confirm a couple of things. Shit. If you're right, we gotta take him out. Take him out? Are you out of your mind? - We're not murderers. - What else can we do? We can't go to the cops now, and if they find out that we got the money and the envelope, - they're going to fucking... - Shh. They're going to fucking kill us like they did that guy we found, so we gotta act first. So, where you girls from? - From the south. - South? Wow! That's kinda vague. Fair enough, I guess. Hey, I'm from California, but I'm on vacation here on the east side. And Billy there is from Virginia and so is our friend. How long are you planning to stay here? We don't know, we're thinking... We're leaving tomorrow morning. Yeah, right, tomorrow, I forgot. Tomorrow? Mm-hmm. I see. You both are having coffee, yeah? I'm gonna go grab a beer. That fucking pervert. He was looking at your ass. Yeah. I know. I did it on purpose. Why? Because now we know their real intentions. Orick, could you help me with something? I just can't really reach it. What do you want me to do? Oh, do you see the lantern? - Just here in the tree? - Yeah. I just need you to take it down so I can change the batteries. All right. - Here you go. - Thank you. You're welcome. Hey, Billy. That's it. You got some wood. See, Enzo. I told you, he would help. - Yeah, thanks. - You're welcome. Hey, Billy. So, what do we got on our foursome? Well, they're definitely up to something. The guys went off and talked all quiet like. And earlier in the tent, I think I saw the money. No fuckin' way. - Let's go get it, then. - Hold up. We can't just go on up in there. They'll never go for that. Well, we'll just have to check it out, then, won't we? Get ready for plan B. Okay. So, I think that Orick is not stupid. And he knows that we know. And he's just waiting for the right moment before killing us. This is insane, man. We're gonna die, man. Would you two just shut up! Wait a minute. Hey! Here you go. Hey, thanks. Night, y'all. Night. Well, well. I was waiting for you to make that first mistake. I'm curious. Where the fuck are you going? Billy, wake up. Come on. Listen, Orick. We're... we're just going to the car to drop off some things, and come back. You don't need to point a gun at us. You know, you're good, Enzo. Hey, you really got some acting in you, you know that? Right, Billy? Yeah, put him in a telenovela. Gimme the bag. Wh... what bag? Hey, listen. I know you're a smart guy. Hey, I don't like killing smart guys. And you knew that I knew our friend wasn't a friend. He wasn't coming back. Because you guys saw him in the wood back there. Dead on the ground. Hey, here's the deal. All I want is my money. And I'll be on my way. Promise. Hand over the bag. Throw him the bag. Don't do it, he'll shoot us. No, I won't. You watch too many movies, boy. - How can we trust you? - Yeah, that's true. Well, you're just going to have to trust me because you know what? If you don't, I'm gonna kill you all. Believe me. I won't hesitate. I saw him kill the Doc just like that. So, don't fuck with him. Just throw him the bag, Polly. - It's not worth it. We tried. - Come on. Throw him the bag. Yeah. - It's all in here. - Good. Even the fuckin' envelope. You got what you wanted, so go. - Let's go, Orick. - Wait. You see, um, we're always stressed. Getting these needs. Haven't you, Billy? - Yeah. - Yeah. Big urges. What the fuck is wrong with you? You got your money, now leave. No, we're not. We have a situation here. First, you lied to us and, uh, you shouldn't have. Then... you tried to steal my money. That's a big mistake. Now we have no choice. Fuck, he's gonna fuckin' kill us and... I said... you watch too many movies, big boy. If you're not gonna kill us, what are you gonna do with us? Well, first of all, Billy here is gonna take care of that little Coco of yours. Yeah. Right, Billy? Yeah, I will. And then, I'm gonna take your woman on, and you're gonna watch me. And not say a word. Yeah. Hey, Billy. That's the price you'll have to pay for me not killing you. - Motherfucker. - Hey, don't move. - Don't move. - Don't fuckin' think about it. I'll put a fuckin' hole in your head. Okay. That's better. Coco, come over here. - Come on. - Please, no. I said, come over here. Come on. Come on. Come on, princess. I said, come on. Be nice to her, all right? Don't mess her up like you did with the last one, - all right? - Yeah. No promises. Fucking kill you... Hey, hey. Don't move, bad boy. Hey. I'll fucking kill you! - Stop. - Bad boy. Think of it as a tax on life. Come on, Billy, give it to her. That's it. Come on. Yeah, come on. Oh, oh, oh. That's it. Make sure she remembers you. Oh, yeah. It's always the pretty ones that struggle the most. I think your boyfriend's jealous. Oh, yeah, give it to her. Ooh, make sure she remembers you. No. Get the fuck off. Jesus. Get the fuck off. Okay, Coco, you killed him. Stop it, stop it. Stop. Stop, stop. You killed him. Okay, stop. Polly! Polly! Ace? Ace? Are you okay, buddy? Are you okay? We just killed two people. Yeah. This is fuckin' bullshit. All of this is fucking bullshit! We should a never come here. This is all your fault, man. This is all your fault, Enzo. You and your stupid camping trip. We should have stayed in the houses like the government said, but no, "It'll be good for us." Huh? Well, is this good for us? No! It's not. You and your arrogant knowledge of shit. Where did it get us now, huh? Where'd it get us? What about all your years of university? What is that worth now, you fucking pipsqueak? Hey... hey, man. Wait a minute. Calm the fuck down, okay? What's the matter with you, huh? It's not my fault all this happened. It's out of my control. I didn't know someone was gonna put a fuckin' bag in the tent, man, full of money. Huh? You really think I... I tried to do the best I can. I told you to leave that money alone. You are the one who told me to touch it. I'm sorry, ah... It's not my fault that you can't... You lost your job and you can't provide for your own fucking family. Fucker. Fuck. Ace, you hit Enzo. What's your problem? - What? - He was just trying to give us a break over the lockdown. Hey. He was asking for it. He fucked us... Stop fighting. What for? He's your best friend for as long as I've known you. How could you not see the fucking situation we're in right now? How fucking dare you? Just because everything is going bad doesn't mean you have to bring it everywhere. Don't let this break anything. I'm sorry, bro. I just really don't know how to fucking deal with any of this right now. You're right, Ace. I did fuck up. I never should've brought you here. You, Coco, Polly. I'll take that fault, okay? I'll take that fuckin' responsibility. Fuck! This right now, is just fuckin' too deep. Before, you asked me... if I knew what I had to do. Fuck yes. I will do what I have to do. I know what I have to do. This is disgusting. Oh, fuck. Well, I'm gonna... Good night. Good night. You okay? I'm so sorry I let this happen. I'm scared. I don't know who to trust anymore. Well, we can't trust Enzo. He just had us bury three people. - What the fuck? - Why are we still listening to him? None of his plans have worked so far. Exactly. What are you thinking? I dunno, Polly. I'm not sure. Everyting's changing so fast. And I'm sensing all these bad vibes. Well, I'm not sensing that at all. They're our best friends. We've known them, what, like... ten years? They would never hurt us. Tomorrow, I'm gonna find a time to ask Enzo for our share of the money - and we're gonna leave. - Good idea. But in case things start to go south with Enzo... you understand? I need to make sure that I can rely on you. - Ace... - Because, if things get rough between me and Enzo, I mean, you know how hard-headed he can be. I need to know that I can trust you to do whatever it takes for me. For us. Because I'm ready to do whatever it takes for you. Ace, you can always count on me. We're in this together. The worst case scenario is they just take the money and leave us here. We can figure that out. Okay. But if it doesn't... we'll have no other choice but to defend ourselves. And defend you, Polly. I will with my life. You understand? Okay. I love you. I love you too, Polly. Where are you going? We need to talk. So, talk, then. Look, I've been thinking about it, and I have discussed it with Polly. The best option we have is just to give the money back to the cops and go back home. I don't wanna know nothing about this anymore... Why are you so goddamn stubborn and always ordering people around? Why don't you give us our share of the money, - and we'll part ways? - What do you mean? This is just bullshit. You want to blame it on us - and keep the money. - No, I don't. Why is it so hard for you guys to accept... Hey, we haven't accepted anything. - Give us our share. - Ace, I'm telling you, I think it's best for all of us. What do you know what's best for us? Yeah, you're not the one who almost got raped. Look, I know nothing I would say would ever take it back. And Billy deserved what he got. - Yeah. - But this is wrong. It's blood money. I know this Covid-19 shit is driving us crazy. No. It's not. You're just saying that because you're lucky. You don't have money problems. You don't have to pay rent or car bills. Just give us our share, now! Excuse me, we have debts as well, remember? Ace, I can't give you your share. It's too much of a risk for all of us. See, I told you, babe. They want the money for themselves. - Listen to me. - Give me the bag. No. - Back off. - If you don't give me the bag, Polly, I will fucking take it from you. - I don't want to, but I will. - Whoa, whoa, calm down! Try to reason with me. We'll get through these hard times. I promise, we will find another way. I've talked with Polly and we'll find a way to help each other. Well, we got a solution. Come on. Stop that. Give us our share. I'm sorry, man. I didn't want to do that, I was just trying to protect Polly. - You shouldn't have done that. - Ace, listen to me. - Please, let's talk. - You keep talking. Stop it, man. What the fuck are you doing? Fuck. This is where we are, huh? Best friends trying to kill each other? Okay, okay, okay. Put that fucking thing down. Stop this. Back off. - Back off. - What the fuck, man? Jesus. All this because of money? You're sick, Ace. - You need some help. - Me? You're the one holding a fucking machete. What are you doing? Stop. Stop. Jesus. Can't kill me like you did with Orick, you fuckin' pussy. Hey, hey, hey, guys. Stop it. - Stop it. - Don't touch me. Don't touch me. Stop it. What are you doing? - Go away. - Fuck, put that down. Put that the fuck down. - Just stop. - Stop, get away from her. I'm not doing this. No. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Oh, my God. Oh, God. Fuck! Fuck. Polly! Polly. Polly. Stop! No. Don't kill him.
