(bird cawing) (tense music) - [Narrator] They say there's a secret world out there. Some seek to find it, some get consumed by it, while others hide from it. (tribal singing) I read somewhere that Native American myths were created to teach us lessons. They're connections to the past sharing spiritual bond between us and animals. Though people have separated themselves from nature, like it was alien, the human mind can experience some of the most amazing phenomenons. Maybe it's our fear of the dark that allows our imagination to fill in the blanks. But what we can't explain, (tribal chanting) the confusion comes when you try to define those experiences (birds cawing) as real or not. (tribal singing) (woman screams) (Tom gasps) - "A Warrior is challenged to assume responsibility, "practice humility, "and display the power of giving, "and then center his or her life "around a core of spirituality. "I challenge all of today's youth "to live like a warrior." By Billy Mills. (school bell rings) All right you guys, don't forget your projects are due after spring break, okay. No excuses. (people chattering) - Did you get the information for our trip girl? - Yeah. I can't wait. - Hey Jess, how's it going? - Hey. - [Mike] Hey Andy. - What's up Mike? (students chuckling) - Look, Andy, you guys, come on, let's get together. - [Mike] Get together everyone! Come on, let's take a picture. - For the yearbook. - Okay. - Come on. - [Mike] For the yearbook guys. - I don't wanna do this. - Come on! - [Mike] You don't wanna take a picture with me? (girls laughing) - Okay, so I'll come over around five. - Hey Andy, Andy! Will you give Lizzy a ride home, I've got practice. - Okay, sure, I guess. Oh Jesus. That's so gross. Like go home. What did you assholes do to my truck! - [Lizzy] Oh my God! (boys laughing) - [Andi] Oh my God Kevin! - Hey, it wasn't that great of a truck! - Michael White! - Seriously? - [Michael] Miguel did it, all right. I didn't do nothing. - [Woman] Not Miguel, you get back here. Get back! (bells jingling) - Honey? (ominous music) Tom. Are you awake? Tom. (Tom grunts) - What happened? What happened? - What's wrong baby? Are you hurting? Is it your head? (floor creaks) - [Mike] Check it out. Kevin, what you think? - [Kevin] Rhythm destination. - [Mike] I'm gonna beat you at the-- - Cool, you found him. Mike, you know what, you're not getting in my car smelling like that. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! You didn't tell her? - No. - My new alter ego, it's Miguel. - Hey Jess, your Mom wants you. Hey, miss me? - Hey baby, of course. - I'll be right back guys. - [Kevin] Lovebirds. Shotgun. - What? - No. - [Jess] What's up? - I have to take your father all the way to Ann Arbor to see the doctor today. - I know. You told me 10 times. - The repairman is coming at four, I need you to let him in. - No, I can't. I have plans. - Don't move! This is Jennifer. No, I can't do that right now. Jess, lose the attitude. - What are you talking about? - I know you're all wrapped up in this ghost trip, okay. But this is a really difficult day for your Father. - Yeah, you won't let me forget! - [Jennifer] We all need to pitch in. - Then pitch in Mom! - Okay, you're gonna be here at four. - Whatever. - Listen, normal seniors take trips to Cancun or Florida or something! - Since when am I a normal senior, Mom? Since when? Okay then, good talk. - [Lauren] Hey! - [Jess] What are you doing here? - Good to see you too? - [Jess] I gotta go, I'm late for school. - What's wrong with her? - Teenagers. - Right. - [Jennifer] When'd you get in? - Late, I just, I didn't wanna wake anyone up. - [Jennifer] Have you seen your Dad? - No. Hey! - Lauren, what are you doing here? - I missed you? - Ah! Good to see ya sweetie-- - You look good Dad! - You look great too! - Hey! - [Dad] Oh, trouble. - Yeah. Good luck old man. - Thank you. - We don't have a handshake? - Oh hey, hey, hey! - We have our own handshake-- - [Jess] Can I still use the truck? - It's okay with me. - [Jess] Yeah. - I'm sorry, she gets to use the truck? - Yeah. For a ghost expedition. With her friends. - I never got to use the truck. - Curse of being the oldest. - Right. - Always working, huh? - One of us has to make an income. Don't do this, not now. - Don't do what? - You promised. You promised you were gonna be supportive of my business. With the medical bills, Jess graduating, Lauren in college? Look, my company's our only lifeline right now. - You know, you don't know what I'm going through right now! Okay, you don't know! You weren't there! I should be dead! - [Jennifer] Don't say that! - You don't know! Who's texting you? The phone just keeps going and going! - They're going to hear us, stop it! - [Tom] Okay, let me see the phone! - No! - [Tom] Give me the phone! - Stop it! - Give me the damn phone! - You're scaring me. What's gotten into you? - I don't know. I don't know what's - Come here. - [Tom] gotten into me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - It's okay, it's okay to be scared. You shouldn't be going through this. - There's so much pain. You're the only person I can let go with. (door knocking) - Hey. Jennifer, Tom, good to see ya. - Hello Doctor. - So, Thomas, how ya feeling? - Hanging in there. - Look, I'm not gonna lie to ya, I am concerned. But we are going to get through this, okay. Tom, let me ask you. Have you been having any shortness of breath, mood swings? - You think that's due to the injury? - Yeah, I think so, maybe. Maybe. We got your tests back. - Hey Mr. Mandl. We have a question. - Yes, what's that? - We've been doing a lot of research on those myths for our trip, but we can't seem to find anything on those old Indian burial grounds. - Oh yes, that's gonna be hard to find, and, well, for good reason. - I mean, all I found was a general map, but it doesn't even pinpoint the actual location. - If you can look right in here. Now, this is your spinal cord and here is the soft tissue mass that is jammed in there behind the spinal cord. And here is a major artery on top of it. Now, at least I think that's what I'm seeing. But, I need to make sure, okay. So I wanna send you downstairs for an MRA and some further blood tests. - When? - [Doctor] Right now, if it's at all possible. - All due respect Doc, this is-- - Tom, Tom! Look, I need to know what the problem is, okay. Now, quite possibly, we may not even need surgery. - But why? I mean, wouldn't surgery help him? - Maybe and maybe not. I mean, right now, from what I know, it's about a 50/50 chance. And even if it were a 100% successful surgery, it would take nine to 12 months to heal, so. - What would surgery potentially do? - Decompress the spinal cord. It would free up the major artery. But, look, it's a very delicate, difficult procedure. And frankly, I would not recommend it unless it were absolutely necessary. - Anything you can give me to deal with the pain? - Just take the pain medication that's been prescribed. Take it easy. Do not push yourself! Oh, and, no driving. Jennifer, okay? - [Jennifer] Yes, yes. - Okay, all right. - Doc, you're asking the impossible. My entire life I've been told to push through the pain, and now you're asking to just stop when I feel it. - Look, Tom, the prognosis of you pushing through the pain could be fatal. You understand what I'm saying to you? It could cost you your life. Okay? So you have new parameters now. Okay. All right kids, look, it's not gonna be easy, but, like I said, we're gonna get through this. Okay? Okay. Kim will be in in a minute to take you downstairs. - Thank you Doctor. - [Doctor] Okay kid, see ya soon. - It's gonna be okay. - Okay, I have a one of a kind ancient map that will get you to where you wanna be. It's very old, so be careful with it. - Thanks. - Careful. - [Andi] Oh my gosh. This isn't far from our campground. See here, look. - [Kevin] Hey, what burial ground? I thought we were going camping? - Kevin, we are going camping. See, right here. Near the river. - That is a sacred burial ground, protected by wolf spirits. Revered warriors are actually buried there. Now, it's a good idea to maintain some respect, so I think you guys should probably stick to the old haunted houses that you found. - But why? 'Cause, I mean I read bout the spirit wolves. - The myth originates in the late 1600s. Legend tells that witches came over from Europe to avoid the most vicious persecutions possible. See, when they arrived, the spiritual warfare broke out between the witch coven and the Indians who lived in that territory. The witches actually used shape-shifting in order to fool the Indian. - Shape-shifting. - [Mandl] And they cursed one particular warrior. - Okay, so where? Here? - [Kevin] I hate to interrupt, but it's almost four o'clock. - What happened? What happened over here? - The repairman? - [Jess] What are you, my babysitter? - [Mandl] The witch was very powerful and she actually cursed herself in aeternum vive. - Awe geez. Hey, no! - Kevin! - [Andi] Bye Mr. Mandl. (ominous music) (bells jingling) (slow paced music) - I can't wait to leave tomorrow. Since Dad came back from the Middle East, it hasn't been the same. (door knocking) Yeah? Oh Jesus. - Hey. - [Lauren] Pizza's here. So what is all this stuff? It's creepy. - It's nothing. - It's been a while. You have a boyfriend now or? - No. (slow paced music) Who has time for that? - I'm sorry, I just thought-- - Why are you home? - I'm worried about Dad. I already lost one parent. Not really ready to lose him too. And he's not getting better. - No, not really. - The doctors don't tell you anything? - No. It's all one big secret. Like some days he pretends he's okay, but I can tell, he isn't. - Yeah. He just seems so tired. I used to think he was indestructible. We were really close. - Yeah. He's just been gone for so long, you know. And Mom has been totally unbearable. - Why, what's wrong with Mom? - I don't know, she's just been acting weird. I just can't wait til I'm out of here tomorrow. I so need this. - That's right. - Yeah. - [Lauren] Yeah, your trip. Tell me about it. - You really wanna know? - Yeah. - Okay. Here. So we're gonna take the I-75 and then a couple back roads that I found and oh! Mr. Mandl gave us this one today. - What's this one? - It's an old Indian burial ground. Some legend about a wolf spirit. It's pretty cool. - It's pretty creepy. - [Jess] Yeah. (floor creaks) (ominous music) (wolf screams) (Jess screams) You jerk! (light music) - Come here, I got it. - Oh, thanks. - Sure. - [Kevin] All right, I got a full battery! We got a full day! Andi! - [Andi] Okay, senior trip, day one! - Okay, I think we're ready to go! - We're gonna die. - Do these belong to anyone? - Oh, yeah, thanks Mrs. Martin. - So you guys are really gonna go chase ghosts? - You can't chase them, but they might be chasing us! - No, not excited. - You can capture ghosts on that? - Well, we can capture apparitions Mrs. Martin. Right Kevin? - Well, be careful. You know how Jess is super sensitive. - Awe! - You big sissy! - [Jess] Stop! - Okay, group picture! Come on. - [Jess] Where's Dad and Lauren? - You know how the doctor said he can't drive? So Lauren took him to the store. But don't worry, he'll be here before you go, okay? - Okay. - Okay, come on. - [Jennifer] Group picture, come on, please. - No, Mom, seriously, we gotta go. - Come on Jess! Just huddle up! (everyone chattering) - Just one okay? - [Jennifer] Okay, you ready? Wait, wait, wait. Wait just a second. I'm not ready. - So you get landscape and portrait. - [Jennifer] Good, let's go! - That's not. - This is my good. - [Jennifer] Smile! - This is it guys! - Yay! Ghosts! - [Jennifer] Good! - Ghosts! - Thank you! - [Kevin] Don't post that on any social media. - Window! - Okay, be careful! - Bye Mrs. Martin. - [Jennifer] Bye! - Bye Mom. - Okay. - [Andi] It's really awesome that your parents let you drive this Jess. - Yeah. - So when are you two gonna tell us what you two schemed up? - Hey, Lizzy! - [Lizzy] Where'd you get all this? - Oh, you know, books, internet. You know what a book looks like, right Brandon? (Jess laughs) - [Brandon] Yeah. - Yeah. - Yo, Miguel. Where are those brownies at, I'm starving? - Be patient. They're a special treat for later. - I got something we can snack on. - Thank goodness. - Here you go Daddy. - [Jess] Me, me. - [Kevin] So, where does the car stop? - All right, so this first place that we're going to, they say this kid went mentally ill, or was possessed by a demon of some sort after finding a skull that was cursed by a witch. One day, after being trapped in his bedroom for years, he busted out, slaughtered his parents, cutting off their legs, their arms, and decapitating them. And then stuffing all of the bloody parts in a closet. - [Mike] Whoa. - But then, he fell to his death, plummeting, and landing on that same sickle. The bodies weren't found until months later. - Ugh. That must've smelled like some nasty-- - Ew, I don't wanna think about it. - Strange occurrences of people falling, the smell of decomposing bodies, and the sound of a sickle slicing through the air is all that's left. That's what they say anyway. - That was scary. - Yeah, I know, I try. - Can we put some music on? - Oh yeah. - Yeah. - [Jess] Pick a jam. ♪ And His blood has ransomed people for God, hey ♪ ♪ From every tribe and language people, every nation ♪ ♪ Where warriors have fallen ♪ ♪ There's a resurrection coming ♪ ♪ It's your time to rise and shine ♪ ♪ Oh wake up, you sleeping giant ♪ ♪ The wounds of injustice are being healed by the peace ♪ ♪ Of Yahweh, who's bringing us power through unity ♪ ♪ Where warriors have fallen, there's a resurrection comin' ♪ ♪ Dry bones, dry bones, come alive ♪ ♪ Yeah wake up, you sleeping giant ♪ ♪ Your heartbeat ♪ ♪ I feel it ♪ ♪ I feel it ♪ ♪ Your heartbeat ♪ ♪ I feel it ♪ ♪ I feel it ♪ ♪ Your heartbeat ♪ ♪ I feel it ♪ ♪ I feel it ♪ ♪ Your heartbeat ♪ ♪ I feel it, I feel it ♪ ♪ Yeah, I feel it ♪ ♪ Yeshua, bring us together, bring us together ♪ ♪ Together we cry ♪ ♪ Yeshua, bring us together, bring us ♪ (friends laughing) - [Jess] This way out of the car. - Is this where we're staying? - Wait, we're staying here? - No silly. Hang on a minute guys. I'm gonna check something out. - Be careful Jess! - Okay, who put her in charge? - Easy. - Well I'm not waiting. C'mon Andi. (slow paced music) (door creaking) Open it. - [Andi] I don't think we should. - [Lizzy] It's just an old barn house. - [Andi] Well then you open it. - [Lizzy] What, are you like--(Lizzy screams) I'm fine, I'm fine! - Guys, I think I just saw something in there. - [Lizzy] Oh my! (slow paced music) - Guys! Come check this out! I saw something move right up there. - What? Are you messing with us? - What? - The door, did you open it? - No. - Yeah. - [Jess] I was looking at that. See? See, there it is. - [Mike] Oh, it's the mental kid! - Hey, it's not funny! - No, I think it's just the wind. I mean, the back door wasn't even locked. This place is abandoned. - I'm telling you, I saw something move in there. - I saw something move inside in the back too. - [Lizzy] You guys. - Well what are we waiting for? Let's see if it's just the wind. - I don't think it's a good idea. - Well, there's a rational explanation for everything, right? (Mike scoffs) - I guess we'll see. If you guys find this tape, and not us, don't go in that house. For reals though, who touched that door? - Come on camera Kev, let's go! (door creaking) - [Andi] I don't think this is a good idea guys. - Maybe whatever she saw is trying to get out of this. Okay. I believe you now Jess. Somebody was definitely in here. They were trying to get the hell out. - Hello. - You really make me feel like the black guy. Look at this! I don't wanna be here! You're a terrible best friend. - I didn't know. - Oh my God. - [Andi] Ew, the sink. - [Kevin] Okay. (ominous music) (floor creaking) - Creepy. - Feel that? It's pretty cold right here. - Yeah, no duh. Cold everywhere. - Yeah. - [Mike] No duh. (ominous music) - What's that smell? - [Mike] It wasn't me. - Mike, I think you're rotting dude. - I don't smell anything. I don't know what you guys are talking about. - Be careful. - This is it. This is the room where he fell down the stairs and landed on the sickle, right here. Here. - Oh no. - [Brandon] Kevin! Yo, what are you doing in the closet? - Oh, I thought I was hearing. Hey man, I ain't in no closet. - [Brandon] Yeah you were. - What, do you wanna arm wrestle? No, you probably want a sword fight, huh? - You were in the closet. - No man. - Kevin was in the closet. - [Mike] Yo Kev, don't on those paranormal TV shows they try to talk to the ghosts? - Yeah, they ask them questions and collect EVP. - What's EVP? - Electronic voice phenomenon. When the paranormal voices get trapped in the background hisses of the recording device. Don't ask me how I know that. - Hello? Is anybody there? (ominous music) Yo Mike, ask them a question. - Y'all smoke trees? You guys like pot man? We come in peace. Hello? Nothing. - Hey Andi, Jess! Awe, I see the real party's down here, huh? Got a whole 'nother video going on. Yeah, raise that shirt up. You guys on spring break or something here. Get it, get it. Oh damn! Hey man, that's your girlfriend. That's a little too much. - Jess? Andi? (ominous music) (door clanks) (Mike screams) - You guys okay? - No! Don't do that! - This has gotta be the room where we saw the figure standing in. Look. Hair standing on my arm. - Look, I don't wanna be here anymore. Can we go? - No, wait, it's the master bedroom. It's where he did it. (door slams) (everyone screaming) - Go go! - [Brandon] Yo, what's going on? Why are you screaming like a little girl? Yeah, I think they're just messing with us. - Brandon! - Shit! - Brandon! - Come on! (door slams) - [Andi] Where's Lizzy and Brandon? - They're right here! - Let go of my hand, you ass! - Ass, bitch, I just saved your life! - You almost broke my ankle! - [Lizzy] Don't call me a bitch. - Look, can we talk about this in the car, please? I'm freaking man! - Come on, let's go! - [Jess] Mike, wait, hey! What happened guys? - [Brandon] Something pushed us. - [Jess] Us too! - You know what, we should all take a hit, it calms the nerves. - [Everyone] Get in the car Mike! - [Brandon] Mike, get in the car! - All right! Go! What was that? - That was a waste of time. - Guys, is everyone okay? - [Mike] Waste of time? What are you talking about? Didn't you get? I didn't touch anybody! - Guys, calm down! - You saw us. - Just calm down, okay? - [Kevin] You guys gotta see this. - I'm not calm, I didn't even get to smoke. - Hey! - What? - [Kevin] Pull over! Pull over! - Let's not pull over. - What are you talking about? - Jess, just pull over the car! - All right, all right, I'm pulling over! - [Lizzy] We're in the middle of nowhere! - I'm pulling over! (Lizzy scoffs) Calm down guys. - [Lizzy] Seriously Jess? - Look, right there. - Yeah, right there. Is this the ghost that stood behind Jess? Right here. - That's him. - Oh my god. - Who is that? - [Andi] That's the kid who killed his family. That was on the camera. - The mental kid? - [Andi] I don't believe it. - What are you doing? You eating a freaking flower? - No, it's a dandelion. I read about it in one of Jess's Native American books. - God Mike! - Good for you. I got the munchies! - [Jess] Let's go Mike. - So, where to next? - What's more exciting than the last one? Hey, can I see those notes? - Sure. - Okay, you guys, this doesn't look any better than the one we were just on. How about the graveyard from the late 1800s? - [Jess] No. Too far from here. - Okay. The forest with the burial ground? It says it's supposed to be one of the most haunted place around. - No, you know, I don't think you guys are ready for that yet. - Why are you two the only ones that get to decide where we go? - [Brandon] Easy. - No, I'm serious. Like right guys? It's not fair. - [Jess] You're right Lizzy. You're right. We could go to the burial ground. - [Andi] Jess, I thought we were-- - [Jess] Andi, she's right. We have to go. - Thank you! Now we get to do something we all want to do. - [Kevin] Hey Jess. - Okay, stay on this for another 15 miles. - Okay. - So, does anyone know what we're actually supposed to do if we run into a ghost? - Apparently run and scream like a little girl, right? - No, you know, (Andi laughs) I read that you're actually supposed to make the sign of the cross and then you ask the spirit if you can help. - Guys, I'd really hate to interrupt this little prayer session that we have going on, but we have got to stop for food. I am starving. - Dude, you just ate like a pound of bacon and eggs. Are you serious? - Yeah, and a protein shake. - Okay, that is literally all you do. - Well, I have a fast metabolism. - [Lizzy] I have to pee! - This looks like a pretty cool place. I'm starving you guys. - What are you talking about Kev? - So where are you kids headed? - Haunted forest. Know it? - Yeah, there's a lot of myths up here. What forest you looking for? - Well have you ever heard of the burial grounds with the witches and the wolves? - Yeah. - Yeah, it's a tourist attraction for wanna be ghost hunters. - Yeah, but is it like really haunted? - Oh sure. Ghosts, witches, bigfoot. - Oh wow! - Bigfoot. - [Jess] That's funny. (Andi laughing) - They say they're not just ghosts you know. They're demons. That old burial ground is protected by wolf spirits. Anyone who disturbs their rest will have a rest themselves. - Excuse me Stan. - [Jess] Thank you. - Hey. Still haven't heard from her? - No. - No. - [Jennifer] We're going crazy. - I'm sure she's fine. I'll check on her on my way back to school. - You know where she is? - [Tom] Where? - Yeah, you don't? - No, she doesn't tell us shit anymore. - Sorry. (Kevin speaks too low) - So it's a wolf-like demon that runs the heart of the forest, attacking anyone who crosses the fence. The first one to jump the fence is the last one to die. They say that demon drove 'ol John Baxter crazy. Hung his family, set fire to the house, then killed himself. Never found his remains. You think I'm playing, huh? Never found his remains. - I read about that somewhere. - Yeah, could have happened not that long ago. But this one don't read, does he? - [Jess] He doesn't take too kindly to it. - I read. - Do you think we can get a map? - I'll be right back. - Thank you. - Jess, we don't need his map. - [Jess] What's wrong with another map? - Yo, I read. - I just don't buy - [Jess] the part about... - There's a lot of abandoned cabins around here. The owners were run off by the demon. Can't say you weren't warned. Two roads in, (ominous music) you looking at me? Two roads in, no ways out. The route off the old fire road is rarely patrolled by the Rangers. Now this is on the house, but you should go home. - So we eat first. (Lizzy giggles) - He was weird. - You guys are toasted. - What the kids asking you about? - About the burial ground. Tried to scare 'em off. - Sure you did Stanley. Sure you did. - All right look, I don't like this, okay? I want you to call me the second you get there, all right. Better yet, write down the address where you're going. - Yes sir. - [Tom] Lauren I mean it. I've already got one daughter missing, I don't need two. - Okay, two daughters missing, got it. - Following this. The store guys map - You sure? - [Andi] said to keep following this road. Yes. Can I have the map please, thank you. Okay. - You said I'm fine? - Yeah. - So this is the right road, right? - Yeah, this is State Road I think. - Everything's a State Road. - Thank you Brandon, that was very informative. - Oh Jess, whoa. You're not gonna believe this, but, we're literally like right next to the burial ground. Look, we're coming up on. (slow paced music) - [Mike] Where are we? - [Jess] Come on, maybe we can stay here. - [Lizzy] Are you crazy? - Maybe I am. Brandon come with me. - Yeah. - That was some nice driving Jess. - Oh, thanks. - [Brandon] I wonder if somebody's home? - Looks empty. Hey, can you guys go check in the back? - [Brandon] Hey Mike, how about a little help? - Hello! - [Brandon] Mike! - Will this help? - [Brandon] Give me that dumb shit. - Hey, it's locked back here. - It's okay. Lizzy, come on. - [Mike] Take your time princess. - Holy shit. - Dude. - What if somebody catches us Jess? - Yeah, we should-- - Stop worrying so much. - We should check the - [Jess] place out guys, before we go too crazy. Know what I mean? - Are those all real? - [Jess] That's a moose. - They forgot to save a spot for Jess, Andi, and Lizzy. (Lizzy chuckles) - That thing could eat you Kevin. - I'll go find a pillow. - They eat grass. (slow paced music) - [Kevin] Yo Mike, is anybody up there? - [Lizzy] We have this whole place! Awesome! - It's kinda cool. - [Andi] What's with all these animals? - Yes, seriously. I mean. - [Andi] Right Jess? - Oh gosh, it's creeping me out. - It's weird but it's cool, kind of. - Seriously. Did you guys bring like something to drink? - Oh gosh. Oh, we need that stuff. Hey guys! Why don't you put those muscles to good use and go and grab our bags. - Yeah. - Yeah. - [Lizzy] Please? - Okay. - Oh. - It's a hat. - Come men. We'll let the ladies clean, while we go use our muscles. - Ladies, prepare yourselves for magical-- - Okay Mike, okay. (Jess screams) - What's happening right now? - I hope you turned your smoke alarms off. 'Cause it's about to get hot! (swanky music) - Oh yes! (Jess and Andi laughing) - [Andi] He just messed up her hair. (men chattering) (Mike imitates sizzling) - Let's go get them things, you know what I'm saying? Slap my ass. - Isn't Brandon beautiful? - Oh yeah. - Yo, we found a fire pit. - Did you just say fire pit? - [Kevin] Mm-hm. - 'Cause look what I have. - Oh sweet! Marshmallows. I don't do those. You know I don't smoke. Yeah, stop trying to get us to smoke. Do you really believe in this paranormal stuff? - Oh, well yeah I do. I mean, don't you? - I didn't. I mean, but after today... (slow paced music) - I don't know, I think it's fascinating. Trying to decipher what exists and what doesn't. Dealing with the paranormal, a lot of it is spiritual. But it's science that makes it real, you know? - Maybe. Really, if I wasn't there I wouldn't believe it. - Well, to tell you the truth, I didn't think we'd find anything. I was hopeful. I'm really glad we did. Can't wait to see the footage you captured. - Oh, I got some good stuff. - Yeah? - [Kevin] I got some good shots. - Hey. - What up, what up bro? - Nice fire. - Impressive! - [Jess] Ooh, our city boys. - This guy right here. - I do what I do. - I taught you well. - Here you go Jess. - [Mike] Let's get those snacks. - [Girls] Marshmallows! - Where's your chocolate Daddy? - Here, catch it Andi. - Go get them sticks. - There you go guys. - [Mike] Here we go. There we go! - Oh! - Catch it! - [Lizzy] I call the first one. Give me the bag. - Deal, deal. - [Kevin] Sticks, sticks, sticks! - Oh yay! - [Lizzy] Thank you. - Kevin, where's my stick? - Here, the big one's Daddy's. (Kevin laughing) - Chocolate? Chocolate. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - [Kevin] Give me some marshmallows. - Marshmallows are a little busy. They're hogging them. - What's wrong? - Nothing, sorry.

It's okay. - Are you okay? - Something's roasting man. - [Jess] Yeah. Isn't that what you're doing? Huh? - Well there's nothing you can do for your husband. We have him stabilized. You go find your daughters and meet us back at the hospital, okay? - Okay. - Okay. - [Brandon] I'll be right back. Hey, you want these? - [Lizzy] Where are you going? - [Brandon] I'm going to the bathroom nosy. - And then there were three. - Jesus. - Four. - [Kevin] I always forget about you Mike, I'm sorry.

Why aren't you outside? - I just needed a break from Lizzy. - [Jess] What happened now? - She doesn't know what she wants. - Well she wants you. - Yeah, that's what she says. The way she treats me is confusing. I mean she's hot and then she's just, she's cold. - I can see that. Maybe you should just try and talk to her? - I tried talking to her. She just blows up. - It's okay. It'll work out, yeah. - [Lizzy] What's going on? - I'm just helping Jess with the pup. - No, I knew there was something going on between you two. - No, there isn't. - Lizzy. - [Lizzy] No, I knew I couldn't trust you! No, no, I've been thinking this for months! - Liz, you need to calm down! Okay. There is nothing going on, we're talking! We are friends, that's what friends do! - You're cheating on me! - [Brandon] No! - What was that all about? - Same old stuff I guess. - Yeah, but is she okay? - I hope so. - Hey. I've been meaning to tell you that I think this trip was a really good idea. (slow gentle music) I'm glad your Mom let you go. - It's my Dad. He convinced her. He told her it was like my walk about before I go to college. Sold. - You know, it's really great your parents are still together. You don't really see that much these days. - Yeah, I guess. Dad's gone so much, it's like they're not together. - Yeah, but at least he comes home right? - Yeah. - Did you see that crow following us this morning? - Yeah, I did. You noticed? - Yeah, you know it has the ability to magically change into whatever is required? - I did. Surprised you did though? - Well, they say the crows says, "My medicine gives you courage to try new things "and not be afraid of the unknown." Kind of like this trip I guess. (Jess chuckles) - You know something. You're kinda cute when you're not high. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Goodnight. (slow gentle music) - Come on Lizzy, it's time to go!

My little sister's in your class. - Yes. Eccentric young lady. - Hi, can I have a coffee please? In a to-go cup. Thank you. - So, hasn't your Father just returned from his tour in the Middle East? - [Lauren] Yeah, he's been back for a while now. - You know, him and I had the same MOS in the service. The exact same job description. - Really? So you're a Ranger too. - [Robert] Yes. So what brings you up here? - I'm, thank you. I'm actually looking for Jessica and her friends. - [Robert] They're up here too? - Yeah, they're on some ghost trip? They're looking at haunted places off a list that you gave them actually. - Oh, that was this weekend? - Yeah, I just can't find them. - You talking about that group of kids that came through here yesterday? - [Lauren] Probably. - Bunch of crazies if you ask me. I mean, who goes looking for demons on purpose, huh? Not me. They wanted to know about some Indian burial grounds. I told them, "Go home." Doubt they listened. - Lauren, if you'd like to follow me to my place, I can actually help you look for 'em. - Sure. Yes. (girls laughing) - Hey. Did you see that? - See what? - I don't know. I saw something move over there. A shadow or something. - Bro, come on. - Come on, let's check it out. - I swear, I saw something. - Go on. - Come on. - I saw something.

There's something back there! - [Mike] Where? - I don't know. It's big and it's moving fast. - Hey, did you guys see that dude across the lake? - There's no one over there man. - Mike. - You're high bro. - [Kevin] There's no one there. - I am not that high, yet. - I don't think it's anything. - [Jess] Nothing to worry about. - [Lizzy] We should start running. - [Mike] Hey, you guys hungry? Because. - Yes, I'm starving, please. - Wanna put your jacket down? - [Mike] I brought a special treat. - Okay. - Oh! - [Andi] Is that all you brought? - That's all he needs. - What'd you bring? - It's true. - Oh hooray! - [Jess] Brownies, my favorite. - Just one? - Are they fat-free? - [Mike] Yes. - Are they fat-free. - Thank you. - Are they organic. - [Kevin] Oh, I got some size on mine. - Nah, nah. - No. - Not happening. - Sorry, it just, it just, no. (Kevin groans) - [Kevin] These are amazing! You my friend have been holding out. Now toss me another one. - Do you think this is the lake they threw the witches in? - What? What witches? - Oh 'cause, I read somewhere that in the late 1700s the way they were able to tell if women were witches or not were. Well there were two ways. So one was either pricking them all over their body to see if they were bleeding, or they would tie their hands and feet behind their backs, throw them in the lake. - Like this lake? - They said if they floated they were witches, but if they sank, they were not. - Basically, these women died. - I would think so. The witch that cursed the Indian, was supposedly beheaded. And they tied her up and they threw her in this lake. Yes. - Why are we here? - Ain't that something? - I don't know. I'm gonna listen to some music. I'm kind of freaked out. - Oh yeah. Partying with dead witches! (upbeat music) - [Jess] You scared?

You didn't believe me. - So, the guy at the restaurant. He said they didn't patrol here, so either we just go back to the car and we'll find them, okay? - Okay. - We're gonna find them. - It's all good. - Why? - [Mike] What good is it gonna do?

Come on. - [Everyone] Surprise! - [Jess] Oh we so got you! - [Lauren] Totally got you! - This is for the last four years of torture you put us all through! - This was all fake? - All right guys, so hey, how about a bonfire, huh? - [Mike] I like it, I like it. - Hi! - What are you doing here? - Mom and Dad were worried so I came to check on you. Happy? - Yeah. Mike scared the crap out of me when he told me you were dead. You suck! - I'm sorry. - You suck. - [Lauren] I'm not dead though. - You suck. - I ran into Mr. Mandl at the diner and he said I should get in on the prank, so. - Really? - Yeah. - Wow. - But I can't reach Mom and Dad. - I can't either, it's all dead. - Oh, we'll try after the bonfire. - Yeah. For sure. - And you don't hate me? - [Jess] Of course I hate you. - What? (both laughing) - I'm kidding! - [Robert] You boys okay? (Andi laughing) - My heart is still pounding. You guys really had us going man. - So you're telling me this was all planned out? I mean, the ghosts, the demons, all of it? - Yup. - Wait. - [Kevin] So none of this was real? - Nah, it was real. Real as can be. - Well this house is actually in between the burial ground and the other myth locations. I mean, I've been studying this area for years and no ones ever seen anything from the side you guys came from. - Really? 'Cause at one point I seriously thought we were being chased by a pack of wild dogs or something. Guys! (Lauren laughing) - Seriously, when I was at the lake by myself you guys, I saw something. It was like glowing. Almost. - Yeah. I saw too. - [Lizzy] Me too. - So Mr. Mandl, will you tell us more of those myths? Please? - Yeah, come on, tell us! - Yeah, please, come on! - [Jess] Story time! - I think you guys have had enough. - [Girls] Come on, please! Tell us! - Okay, okay, okay. All right. All right, let's see. So it's been said, that there was a horrific spiritual battle between light and dark. An absolute slaughter near the river. Now the warriors who fought in this battle were buried at this site. And they were given a rare ceremonial burial where they were appointed wolf-like spirits to ensure that they would rest in peace. The leader of this battle was known as the protector. His spirit appears as a white wolf. - How did the battle start? - Witches trespassing on Indian land. See, the witches would shape-shift into wolves and try and fool the tribe. But the elders, they wouldn't fall for their tricks, except for the chief's very own son. The next in line to lead the tribe. See, the witches, they put a curse on him. Humiliating him. Causing disgrace between him and his Father. So see, the evilest of all witches put a curse on the warrior so he would bring death and devastation to his very own tribe. Kevin, you know this from the other day. - So! The elders told the warrior that he was disgraced, and if he wanted to break the curse, he had to bring back the head of the demon. They say, spirit wolves protect it so no one can disrupt the demon. So, anyone who removes the skull from it's burial ground will be possessed by the demon. Obtaining all the witches powers, driving any man crazy, ultimately leading to his death. - So what does the demon look like? - It is said they have eyes that glow yellow. As a wolf-dog that takes shape as a man. (tense music) Wolves have the strongest supernatural powers. - I think he's taking a leak. (rustling leaves) - [Robert] The hunt is usually settled in the first moment of staring between a predator and prey. - He's got you guys. - Now this encounter - [Robert] is known as the conversation with death. - I think I should head back to school, it's getting late. - Oh no, stay. You can leave in the morning. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - With all your friends here? - Don't be crazy, come on. - Okay, I'll stay. - He's just trying to scare us. - Yeah. We're not falling for that again. Right Kevin? - All right, we'll be right back. - We're getting firewood. - Bowchickawowow! (rushing winds) (Lizzy screams) - [Woman] Somebody, what's going on? (rushing winds) What's going on? - Go! - Hurry! - We gotta go, we gotta go! We gotta go, we gotta go! I think it's gone. - Stay here. - You gotta go to the cabin okay? All right, you gotta go! You gotta go now okay! Go! (rushing winds) (Lizzy screams) - Get inside! - Lizzy! (window banging) (Lizzy screams) (ominous music) (rushing winds) (tense music) Lizzy! - Hey, you okay? Hey, young lady! Hey! You gotta be kidding me. God. - Officer! Officer! - We need help! - [Officer] Hey, someone tell me what's going on here! Someone tell me what's going on! - It caught him! - Relax! - [Jess] It caught him, it caught him! - Listen, one at a time. - You don't understand! It got Lizzy and Brandon! - What got Lizzy and Brandon? - We heard wolves howling and this thing! - This thing, it came out of the woods so fast man. - Mandl's gone! - What do you mean Mandl's gone? - I don't know. - A wolf attacked him - [Kevin] or something. - All right listen, I want you all back in that house now. Do you hear me? Move! - Mike, get in the house! Mike, get in the house. Over here! - [Kevin] What the hell was that? - What are we gonna do? - I don't know, I don't know! - I vote for leaving. - We need, we need weapons. - Jess. - [Jess] We need something to protect ourselves. - I saw a crossbow in the garage. - Can you go get it? - No, we need to get to the car, and we need to get out of here! - I'm not going anywhere without protection. - Mike! - Mike, Mike, no! - Mike, don't! - Mike, where are you goin? - [Lauren] Mike, don't! Jessica. (ominous music) (wolves howling) (door creaking) - Well that's not good. (wolves howling) (ominous music) (Mike grunts) (flashlight rattles) - I'll go. - No, wait, I'm coming with you. - No you're not! You're staying with Andi, let's go. - Be careful guys. (ominous music) - Mike! Mike! (dramatic ominous music) Hey man. Here he is. - [Lauren] Mike! Mike! - Here, hold this, hold this. - Give me that! - Mike. - Get him up. - [Kevin] You all right? - [Lauren] Let's get him inside. (ominous music) - This is all my fault okay. - [Lauren] Come on, bring him inside! - Mike! Mike are you okay? - Here, sit. - What happened? (door banging) - [Jess] What the hell was that? - Maybe it was the police officer? - [Lauren] Do tell, Andi. Mike. Here, put this over here. Put this on your head. Put pressure on it. - Where's Mr. Mandl? - That thing. - [Jess] Did you see it? - No. It happened so fast. He came out of nowhere and just took me out. Why didn't it just kill me? (door banging) (everyone gasps) What the hell was that? - Jess! Jess! Jess, get away from the window! - Come on Jess! - Get away from the window! - [Andi] Come on Jess! - I don't understand, why is this happening? - This is insane. This better not be another prank. - It's not a prank Mike. We were all there. - Where is everyone? Hey, Jess! - Shh. Look, where does that door lead to? - Hey. Don't. - I'm fine. Yeah, it's just a closet. Hey. Hey, look at this. (suspenseful music) - [Kevin] Let's go find the others. - [Andi] Give me your flashlight. - In the living room. Come on, leave it. Jess, Lauren. - [Andi] Mike.

(ominous music) - If we can get to Lauren's car-- - I don't have my keys, I gave them to Mike! - Mike. - No. - Yes. - I thought I have them - [Mike] back to you. - No. - Well there's the cops car too. We could just use that. - Not enough light out there. - [Lauren] I'm sorry, I should've taken you guys home when I had the chance. Dad's gonna be worried sick about you. - You can't blame yourself, okay? - You guys, we just gotta make it to sunrise, right? - Mike, what the hell does sunrise have to do with anything? (wood creaking) Idiot. (ominous music) (bells jingling) What the hell was that? - [Jess] It's playing with us! - I can't take this anymore. - [Kevin] Only a couple of hours til sunrise right? Let's go find another closet. - You know what, maybe it is safer down there. - There's not even a ladder to get us down there. - You know what, I'll go check it out. - No you won't, you're staying here. - Why are we even checking out the basement? - Maybe there's a way out Mike. - Yeah, so is the front door. - We can't go out the front door Mike! You wanna die? - Okay, I'm gonna go down. - No wait! Let me go. I'm the smallest one. I can fit down the hole better. (ominous music) - You sure? - Just give me the light. I'll be okay. It smells. I think I see a machine of some kind. I think it looks like an elevator. Have you seen an elevator down in a basement before? - [Jess] No, what else is down there? - I don't know.
