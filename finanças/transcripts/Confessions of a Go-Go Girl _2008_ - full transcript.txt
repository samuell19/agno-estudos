You guys really shouldn't have. Listen, there's something I have to tell you. I'm not going. To law school, I mean. What the hell are you talking about? We've already paid your tuition. You're going to law school. I want to act. You want to be an actress? Kind of snuck up on me. I took a couple of classes and then I was the second lead in the senior play. The head of the darrow theatre academy saw me and told me I should audition. I did, and I got in. You guys both wanted law school for me so badly that I thought I did too. But I don't. Did you know about this? You're her boyfriend. Yes, but... Can't you say something to her? Who's going to pay for this acting school of yours? You pay Jamie's tuition. Your brother is getting his masters. He's going to be a psychologist. If you want to go to a real school well that's fine.

(Laughs) It probably works out to about that. You're right. I don't know what I'm going to do about money.

I could at least help you with that. - Present. - Really? - Yah. - That's sweet. - It's nothing. So this dinner with your father tonight, it's all his lawyer firm friends, right? I'm going to be the only civilian. You might want to save that little piece of information for desert. I haven't told my father your news yet. Why not? It just hasn't come up. I thought you understood. I do. But you just can't expect everyone else to. Could you maybe act like a lawyer? Just for tonight? Sure. I'm a professional. I'll fake it 'til I make it. Thank you.

A friend of mine took these. Hmm...ah, that's... That's really sweet. But it's not really a portrait, you know, it doesn't tell me the truth about you. What do you mean the truth about me? Have you ever heard the old saying that a picture steals a part of someone's soul? K, well I think it should if it's any damn good. Yah... I know what do with you. Babe, you think we can cut Jane a deal? Like, three-fifty? Sure. Why not? As long as she stays for dinner. You know, people say I look like Marlon Brando and I think that he's my old man. I'm serious, okay? I know it sounds crazy but him and my mom went armadillo hunting just outside of Albuquerque once when he was there, you know, doing a movie I can't remember which one, but he picked her up at a diner and anyways, they never did get any armadillo. Well, I think your much handsomer than him. How'd you two meet? Ah.. I took her picture. He...he set up the camera and he looked down the lens and he said the greatest thing. He said you're a woman warrior. Then she said the greatest thing back. She goes, let's make this a big deal. Ah-mm. Okay. Hmm. That was, uh, three years and four months ago. And he's been sober ever since. Only one drink a day, right baby? That's right. I got it down to a science. Alright, I got to, uh, go to work. Oh, babe! Um I'm running a little low again, okay?

Your father kills himself all year for this. It's a time where we can go away as a family in a beautiful place. What's gotten into you little girl? It's not like you to rock the boat. I'm not trying to, but acting is important to me. Why can't you guys just take that seriously? Well I'll tell you what? I'll take it seriously on the plane back home. I can't go.

This is your big chance to let them out. Each of you are going to create a character. Give them a back story, an objective, a point of view. You are going to eat, sleep, live, and breathe them. You are going to wine and dine them. Do whatever it takes to bring that character to life. Later this term, you will perform a monologue as that character at our showcase.

Oh wow, she's beautiful. Hm-mm. Straight-a student. She wants to be a doctor. Does she know about this? Oh yah, she's fine. I mean I get a sitter for her three times a week while she's sleeping and then I'm home all day every day with her. You know what you need, is regulars. Guys that call in just for you. They come on your nights. I mean, the more you have the better the shift. The better the shift, the better tips. I have regulars coming out of my ears. How do I get a regular? Well, when you're out there and you get a little extra attention from a guy show him a little extra attention back. You hook him, and you reel 'em in. It's nothing. Look, all they want is for you to notice them and then they start bringing you things like underwear, jewelry. I mean one of my regulars is a podiatrist and he gives me an orthotic. I mean, just because I have go-go toes. Wow! You look amazing. Well, this work certainly keeps you in shape. Keeps your mind off your crows feet and your laundry. You know it's an amazing feeling. It feels like your getting daddy's attention at the dining table. Alright, you need this for under the lights so you don't look splotchy and pale. Body glue so nothing pops out, and you need a costume something that you can't see through. I get mine from Donna. We all do. She's good. She should get herself a rocking chair and stick to sewing. I've been thinking about a name. Good! You need a name. It's like a theme. It helps you pick your music. Plan your moves, you've gotta have a theme. That's like what were talking about in my acting class right now. Creating an identity. I think my girl, she's been told what to do her entire life until now. - Who? - My character. Oh, ok...Whatever. (Laughs) Ah, cute, cute...But after tonight I want you to get yourself a real costume. You want to look the part. - I will. After tonight. - Alright. Now, let me see you do the look. Chin down. Eyes up. Eye contact, very important, eye contact. Let me see that smile. C'mon, that's it! Remember, these guys they don't want to be reminded of their wife or their mother, god forbid. What do you want me to call you? I'm Dylan. Dylan! A guy's name. That's sexy. Alright, Dylan.

Well, not featured, but ranked. You're definitely teacher's pet. He said he wants to adopt you. Oh yah? Why don't we adopt her? Yah, you stay in the spare bedroom. You guys go to work together.

Why? Nancy called. She went to buy makeup yesterday. They said you don't work there anymore. I don't. I'm a floater now. I go to whatever department needs me. I got a letter from your law school today. They said they'd refund the tuition but not the deposit. You better keep that job. You're going to have to pay US back. I know it's tough, but fair is fair sweetie. 2,500-- here, I'll pay you back with interest. There's the down payment. By the way, I'm moving out. Isn't it like something out of a magazine? Where do you want me to put this? Hey, who wants coffee? Hi, I'm Angela. I'm Eric. Thanks, but no thanks. - Hey babe. - Yes? Is this for work? It's for you...Sorry. Hi, you're gonna enjoy the perks, man. What, what perks? - He means US being able to hang out without my parents. - Oh. Yah, you got a real sweet one there. I'd be careful if I was you. Thanks. (Donna) Okay, hold still. (Jane) This is cute. How much is this one? The outfit is sixty and the shoes are thirty. But they'll pay for themselves in one night just ask Angela. So, how's it feeling? Good. Um, what do I do about this? Ah, double-sided. Tricks of the trade. Tie it on the top to make you look Fuller. Higher on the sides to make you look taller. Just an optical illusion. Hey, honey. Jane this is my daughter Elizabeth. Your mom talks about you all the time. Yah, she has a habit of doing that. Are you going to stay for lunch? We're having salad. You're welcome to. I'd love to but I have to go. Mom's teaching me how to cook. I can't just make it up like she does. Honey, could you get my purse for me? Her father left when she was a year old. He never said a word. I should be thankful really. I mean, he taught me a valuable lesson. Be careful who you let into your life. So how long have you known Angela? Not too long, but she's great. She's really been helping me out a lot. Just be careful. Unhappiness is a sickness. It's catching. You're doing good work. Today is the first day that I've seen you free yourself up in an improvisation. Jane sticks to the script but Dylan isn't afraid to wing it. She's real to you. It shows in your work. Telling the truth is not easy. Wow! Look at you! I told you my outfits pay for themselves. You know what? I think you're ready for another one. Maybe something with a little bit more flash. Oh, no you don't. No you don't. She's got a good thing going with this girl next door routine. Maybe you can come up with, ah, ooh, a candy-striper costume or something. You know what, Nick? You remind me of my ex-husband. Ah, that's funny because you remind me of my ex-wife. Hmm...which one? You! I'm giving you the eight o'clock shift starting Thursday night. Comes with a raise, seven bucks an hour. - The eight o'clock? - Yah. 50 bucks more tips working the night crowd at least. Oh my god! Thank you. Wow! You're welcome. Uh, I, I don't think she's ready for Thursday night. Why don't we start her on Tuesday and see how it goes? No, she's got a nice following. Regulars, guys calling in. Thursday Dylan's going prime time. You know what honey? You're not going to get done working until midnight and then you got to be at school in the morning. You're burning the candle at both ends. I can handle it. Hey sis. How you been? Good. Hi sweetie. You look all grown up. It had to happen some day. Hi Jane! Here, take a look at the wedding invitations. Oh! Aren't they absolutely perfect? Perfect. So, what are you doing in town? There's a conference. The American society of family therapists. My professor's presenting a paper and he asked me to come speak. He's the only graduate fellow that was invited. And Lily took a leave of absence from the network so she can stay and plan the wedding. You only get married once.

Mom and I were thinking of something more simple. You're calling her mom now, that's cute. Expensive too and you paid cash no less. I did what I said I would do. I went out and got a job. What else do you want from me? Return the dress. I'll buy you the other one. Thanks but I think it's suits me. It's okay, mom. Remember what Jamie said. (Nick) Angela, would you slow down? Angela!
