♪ ♪ ( people clamoring ) Veteran #1: Pay the bonus now! Newsreel announcer: The climax of the bonus army's two-month siege is rapidly developing in the shadow of our nation's capitol. Since early June, nearly 18,000 veterans of the Great War of 1917, many homeless and starving, have been camped with their families on the flats of the Anacostia River, demanding payment of their promised soldier's bonus. Today, one policeman and one bonus marcher were killed in skirmishes with local police, prompting President Hoover to order the U.S. Army, under the leadership of General Douglas MacArthur, to remove the veterans. 1500 federal troops, a combined force of infantry, cavalry and the newly-formed armored division, have responded to the president's call to put an end to the veteran's rebellion. ( clamoring ) Veteran #2: That's right! Veterans: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! ( clamoring continues ) Reporter: General, any thoughts about going against former soldiers? Watch me. Reporter #2: Sir, are you concerned at all about how many troops... Veteran #1: We want what's coming to us! Now! Veteran #2: We want what we deserve! Regimental sergeant, break out the colors. Major Hardesty, sir, I think they know what army it is. Do as ordered without insubordination, Sergeant Libbey. Veteran #2: Give us our bonus! Break out the colors! Hardesty: On command! In line right! And hold! Veteran #1: We stand together! We want what we deserve! ( yelling ) Veteran #2: Stay together! Veteran #3: We want what we deserve! Draw... Veteran #4: We are your countrymen! Hardesty: ...sabers! Veteran #2: What are we coming to? Veteran #4: Do not pat us on the back! Veteran #3: We gave our blood, give us our bonus! Veteran #4: Pay the bonus! Pay the bonus! Veteran #1: Sir! Congress must not adjourn! ( overlapping shouts ) Veteran #2: Pay the bonus now unless you're gonna let 'em get by... ( sheathes saber ) I gave an order, sergeant. Your order goes against my conscience, sir. Veteran #2: Do not pat us on the back! These men served with us in France. They're only asking for what they were promised. This is mutiny, Sergeant Libbey. Veteran #3: Pay the bonus now! You're under arrest, mister. You and these other men return to post... Under your own recognizance. ( clamoring continues ) Veteran #1: Give us what's coming to us! Veteran #1: We want what we deserve! ( crowd cheers ) Hardesty: Seconds! Keep back! Get back, get back. Stay back! Get your hands off that woman! Soldier: Don't move any further. Stay back there! ( radio static ) ( tunes ) Radio announcer: The attack is on. General MacArthur is in command. The army of the United States is attacking its own veterans. Their camps are being destroyed. This is a national disgrace, one of our country's darkest hours.

Marsh Buxton, ma'am. Only my good friends call me an idiot. Jessica Stuart and I'm not your good friend. ( engine starts ) Kind of takes your breath away, doesn't it? Cowboy soldier... I should have guessed. Excuse me. Sir, bachelor officers' quarters are the last building at the left side of the drill field. Regimental HQ is right in front of us. Thank you, private. Private: About the woman, sir. Lady friends are off-limits at this time, sir. With all due respect, she isn't my friend. I'm Jessica Stuart, private. Stuart? As in Colonel Stuart, ma'am? Holy Moses. The commanding officer's daughter? It kind of takes your breath away, doesn't it? ♪ ♪ Let's see, you were fourth in your class at West Point. You speak three languages. And, according to this, you're just about expert in everything. I don't understand something. Why would they take a man so special as you and waste him by send him out to a godforsaken place like this? I don't underst... Stuart: Now I understand. I see. Uh, listen. Maybe you'd like to enlighten me as to this incident here of you... striking an officer at your last post. It was a soldier's fight, sir. He was abusing his horse and I stopped him. Did you win? Yes sir, I did. Let me ask you a question. Uh... do you have trouble with authority? Yes sir. Well, you will have no trouble with authority here, my lad. Let me explain that to you, all right? The cavalry isn't in enough trouble now and discipline... It is critical to our morale and essential for our survival, yours and mine. Is that understood? And you'll carry out your orders and you'll do 'em smartly! And if there's one iota of insubordination in your eyes, you'll face charges! Am I understood? Yes sir. I can't hear you. Yes sir! That's much better. Okay. Now... ( sighs ) since you're attached to the 12th and I had the honor of serving with your father, I'm gonna have Sergeant Rutherford here, he's gonna amend your records. And then you'll be able to start here with a clean slate. Thank you, sir. Dismissed. ( door opens ) Jessica? ( sighs ) Father. Man: Ho! Hup! ( horse nickers ) Man: Back back back back back. ( clicks tongue ) Oh, back. Back back back back back. ( clicks tongue ) Whoa. ( spits ) Good evening, Mr. Quinlain. Afternoon, Top. Got that stud working pretty good, Tom. Yeah, he's coming along. Hello, Ahab. Afternoon, sir. Buxton: Gentlemen. Master Sergeant Libbey. Marshall Buxton. May I present Sergeants Quinlain and Mulcahey. Pleasure, sir. It's an honor, sir. I've been assigned officer in charge of remounts and stables. Regulations call for a quartet of horses for each man in the cavalry. These all the horses we have? There's a few more. Sergeant Quinlain, sound the recall. They're still grazing, sir. ( bugle playing ) Libbey: By any chance would you be related to a Thomas Buxton, sir? He was my father. May I say, sir, that he was one hell of a fine horseman? The best, sir. God love him. Seems like everyone in the cavalry knew him. We had the pleasure of wasting the better part of our youth in the Mexican Campaign. "Wasted"? Hell... they got the medal of honor in the same ceremony. It was a sight to behold, sir. What in God's name are you doing here? It's a long story about a quick decision. ( horses galloping, neighing ) Men: Yah yah! ( men whistle ) It's an old cavalry trick, sir. If a soldier got separated from his mount, a bugle call would bring him back on the double. Man: Let's go! Ha! Aw, damn it, Quinlain! Is this some kind of a joke? Sergeant Shattuck, can I introduce Lieutenant Buxton? Pleased to make your acquaintance, sir. Every officer can choose his own mount, sir. Personally, I favor that sorrel mare. ( horse blows ) ( nickers ) Soldier #1: Hey, Gordon, get a load of these. Soldier #2: What the hell are those things? Soldier #3: What's going on here? Soldier #2: Hey, troops, come over here and take a look. Officer: Get those horses out of the way, soldier. God damn it, we got tanks coming through here. ( indistinct chatter ) Not Hardesty. John. Owen. It's a surprise. They didn't tell me it was gonna be you. I wasn't notified until 10 days ago myself. This is my ADC, Major Forrest. I'd like to be shown to my quarters now. I'll take formal command at 0900 tomorrow morning. So that's the future. Oh. ( bugle playing ) ( reveille plays ) ( horse neighs ) I feel like an idiot. I don't think I've ever seen you out of uniform. I haven't worn one of these... ( inhales deeply ) in years. You look handsome. Darling, I am a soldier. And it hurts me that you disapprove of this. I don't disapprove of you. I'm proud of you. Sure, 'cause I'm out of uniform. I don't hate the army. It's the systematic stupidity of it that galls me. ( clears throat ) I'm glad that you write for the newspapers, 'cause you got enough opinions to choke a horse. ( soldiers chattering ) ( hoofbeats approaching ) Libbey: Sir. Uh, you don't have to do that. I'm not in the army anymore. Sir, we'd like you to have the Felicista standard we captured at Carrizal. But I wasn't there. I was... I was at Guerrero. Yes sir. And if you hadn't been at Guerrero, not a man in our unit would have walked out of Carrizal alive. Sir. It's been an honor, sir. Thank you. Miss Stuart, Colonel. Goodbye, sir. Listen, if you're ever down Tucson way, drop in and say hello to an old war horse. Thank you, sir, I will. Stay out of the brig, Mr. Buxton. I'll do my best, Miss Stuart. Gentlemen, in compliance with War Department orders, 12th Cavalry is to be incorporated with the 23rd Infantry. I'll expect the utmost in cooperation from all officers and men. I will brook no slackness within my command. Additionally, by special order AG-474.71, subject salary: "Salaries to all enlisted personnel, including officers, shall be reduced 15% henceforth." By special order AG-474.72, subject saber: "The saber is hereby discontinued as an item of issue to the cavalry." Finally... it has been directed by Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur that in these times of increasing economic hardship, the cavalry is to dispose of excess horses. Accordingly, with the cooperation of the Mexican government, these said remounts are to be driven across the border to be thereby disposed of two days hence. Lieutenant Buxton, you will be in charge of this exercise. Details will be worked out with Sergeant Gruber. Hardesty: I'm sorry, gentlemen, but army is the whipping boy of Congress. Our supporters are either in insane asylums or the movies. Major Forrest, dismiss them. Uh-hup! Dismissed! Sir, I respectfully request permission to be excused from this detail, sir. Request denied. Sir! I cannot in good conscience be part of this, sir. Cannot?! By God, you will do as ordered, mister, or face a goddamn court-martial! Your conscience be damned, man! May I see a written order, sir? ( quietly ) You may not. Is there a written order, sir?! You're insubordinate, mister. Dismissed. ( big band melody playing ) Hand it in, son. Mr. Buxton! Lieutenant! Better come quick, sir. It's Libbey. ( mirror breaks ) ( grunts ) Sergeant! Sir! Libbey: Beg your pardon, sir. I will straighten it up. ( crashes ) ( gun clicks ) You go to hell. I'm already there. There's nothing left. No horses, no cavalry. No honor. God damn it. ( sighs ) I hate what this world is becoming. So do I, sergeant. Sergeant. Carry on. ( door closes ) ( sighs ) ( motor whirrs loudly ) ( rattling ) Man: These guns are moved over there. They should've been here by now, sergeant. They'll be just a couple minutes, sir. All right, have these men fall back. Platoon, fall back. Man: They're 80 yards apart. ( Buxton whistling ) Mulcahey: Giddyap now! Giddyap! ( whistles ) Hyah, hey! Come on. Hee! ( whistling ) Yah yah! Giddap, giddap! C'mon, Muley, giddap, giddap! ( whistles ) ( horses whinnies ) Yah, come on! Ha! Come on! ( men whistle ) Man: Yah yah! ( whinnies ) 506 remounts as requested and ordered, sir. May I remind you we are soldiers, not cowboys? Cowboys use lariats, Mr. Buxton. Soldiers utilize crops. Well, 500 head are a lot to handle, sir. The pit can handle only perhaps 100 at a time. Instruct your men to divide them up and bring them forward in order. Yes sir. Forrest: Sergeant Gruber, prepare your men. I'm not happy about this, sergeant. No sir, but then we're cavalry. You're artillery. There was a time when artillery depended on horses, you know? And they were properly retired to Fort Sill. They weren't murdered. I won't bandy words with you. Carry on. ( kisses ) Giddap. All right, let's cut out 100 of 'em and drive 'em down into the pit! C'mon! Hew! Shattuck: Yew! Hup! Hup! ( whistles ) Hold on, whoa. ( neighing ) Get around there! Come on, come on, come on. Yah! ( whistles ) Get that little gray mare. Hold the middle. Hold it. ( shouting continues ) ( neighing ) Yah yah! All right now. All right. Giddyap giddap. Come on! Come on, there you go. ( neighing loudly ) Ho. Get! Come on! Those two also, let's go! Man: That's it, that's it! Move it. God, I hate to see this. ( neighs loudly ) Platoon, lock and load. ( gun clicking ) ( loud neigh ) ( horses neigh ) Ready. Take aim. Fire! ( horses scream ) ( screaming continues ) ( grunts ) ( firing continues ) ( gunshots ) ( neighs ) God help us. We never even killed the enemy like that. Shut up, Tom. Mulcahey: God damn it, Jack, We got to do something. Like what? You got General stars on your collar? ( horses wheeze ) ( flies buzzing ) Finish it, sergeant. First platoon, pick your targets and fire at will. ( gunshot ) This ain't right, Top. ( gunshot ) ( gunshots continue ) ( horses scream ) We can stop it now before they shoot any more. Stop it, sir? How? By moving the remainder of the horses to safety. ( gunshot ) You suggesting we steal the herd, lieutenant? I'm suggesting we take them into protective custody before they murder any more. ( horse screams ) ( gunshots continue ) Take them where, sir? Away from those guns. Shattuck: God damn it, I love those horses, but this smacks of insanity, sir. That's insanity. ( gunshot ) I suggest you decide now, lieutenant. Let's go! Come on! Watch it, hey hey! Man: In there! Get out of my way! I'm just doing the job! Huh? Watch out! Watch out! Look out, look out! What are you guys doing?! What are you doing?! No no! Don't let them... Lieutenant Buxton, what the hell do you think you're doing?! Saving the remainder of the remounts. This is mutiny, mister! No sir! A cavalryman's first duty is to his horses. The regulations specifically forbid endangering their lives outside of enemy engagement, sir. I believe this expedition to be an illegal act conducted on the part of the War Department. Illegal act? Yes sir! Have you seen any written orders? As remounts' officer, you are in charge of this, mister! I merely command the infantry. It is also my belief, sir, and since I have seen no written orders, I believe that my first duty is to the horses. Lieutenant Buxton, you've lost your wits. Yes sir. Forrest: Have your men cut loose those machine guns immediately. No sir! Sergeant! Yes sir? Forrest: Have your men take possession of those guns. Damn it, Jack, don't do this. Now we will take possession of the remounts, sir. This'll mean Leavenworth. I will await the results of the court-martial. Sir. Yah! ( Mulcahey whistles ) Get! Hyah! Come on! Yah yah! Yeah, come on, come on! Ha! Giddyap giddap! They have to be stopped! Any suggestions as to how, sir? Arrest them, damn it. Well, I doubt they'll submit, sir, not without a fight. I've known Jack Libbey 20 years off and on. Not a man I care to tangle with. Damn them! Yes sir. ( shouting ) ( whistling ) ( neighing ) And you just let them go? Begging the colonel's pardon, but we thought it was the best course of action... I will remind you, major, we were under War Department orders! Where are they now? They could be anywhere, sir. But I think they'll head north. North? North indicates a vast area, major. North is all of America! Officer: Yes sir. Sergeant. Cable the details of this fiasco to the War Department requesting instructions. Yes sir. Major, assemble a regiment. I want B-troop patrolling the Mexican border. The mechanized column will move north. I want those men taken. I want their hides framed and hanging on my wall! Yes sir. May I speak, sir? Be concise and constructive, sergeant. There's a lot of open country out there. They know how to move quietly and cover their tracks. 400 horses are not easy to hide, sergeant. No sir, but there's desert and canyon land to the north and not many paved roads. So your vehicles will be all but worthless. My vehicles will do quite well, mister. They will transport a squadron of your fine troopers to within striking distance. And you will affect the capture of the renegades. Yes sir. ( engines revving ) Colonel. If they refuse to surrender, then shoot them. ( whinnies ) ( sighs ) Well, the genie's out of the bottle, sir. You don't have the cork. What now? To tell you the truth, sergeant, I haven't a notion. Aw, what in the Sam Hill have we gotten ourselves into? Trouble. We've gotten ourselves into a lot of trouble. Sir. Colonel Hardesty is bound to come after us. And soon. ( sighs ) Head north by northwest. Meet me in a place called Broken Hill. You know the spot, sergeant? I do indeed, sir. And you? Well, if I ride hard, I can make Tucson by tonight. I'll catch up with you sometime tomorrow. ( clicks tongue ) ( horse departs ) Quinlain: Well now. ( scoffs ) We're out here on our own, with no plan, an officer that couldn't lead flies to shit, and Sean here says, "Well now," just like a priest. That's one scared little lieutenant, Jack. Well, let's not count him out... yet. ( motor revs ) Soldier: It's the tread. This tank's not going anywhere. Officer: Move it! Move it on that truck! You shut that tank, soldier! That truck's full. Use the other one! Lock down that equipment. ( chatter continues ) Officer: Double time. I need to speak with your father. Oh, God Almighty. The army has gone mad. Ohh. So then... you and your men, you conspired to mutiny. There were no written orders, sir. I don't consider it mutiny. May I remind you of something? That you are an officer in the United States Army and you have taken an oath to obey orders whether they're written or not! ( tray clatters ) ( Buxton sighs ) Sir, General MacArthur has decided that the cavalry is obsolete. He may be right. I do not know. But when they muster out the troops, they thank them for their service and they wish them well. They do not march them behind the barracks and shoot them! The cavalry is men and horses. And we have a tradition and a duty to protect them. They fight beside us and they die beside us. They deserve the same respect and the same honor. Well... It's a point of honor, all right. Given the situation... if I was in your position, I hope to God I could do the same. Oh, stop gaping, woman. Now what's your plan? Well, Hardesty is south. So... I thought we might move north. That's not a plan. That's a direction. The truth is... ( clears throat ) with all due respect to the army, nothing at the Point prepared me for this. I don't know what rules apply anymore. I was hoping that... that you could help me. I don't know what to do, sir. Well, first of all, sit down. Well, you've fallen out of the fold, that's for sure. The War Department'll give you little mercy and General Douglas MacArthur will give you none. So now you have to make a choice, you see? You can either fall back or you can go forward. Back is wrong, sir. There you are. Now that's your first willful conscious decision. And that's what makes a leader. You got a map? No, I haven't, sir. Here you are. One map, one compass. That's about all the help you'll get. Thank you, sir. Another thing. Listen to Sergeant Libbey, my friend. He's a hell of a soldier. I will, sir. Lieutenant. Good luck. Thank you. You're a damn Boy Scout, aren't you? What do you mean? Stealing 400 horses from the army to save them. You're out of your mind. Well, I don't exactly consider it stealing. They were about to be destroyed. I wish you luck, lieutenant. Thank you. You'll need it. ( door closes ) You could have been more generous. Well, I gave him the best advice I could. You gave him a map and sent him on his way. What do you want me to do, ride out and join him? I don't know, but you can't just leave him out there in the wind. I did everything that I could do. You're retired, not dead. I know what I can do. Sure, you're gonna write your article. You know what'll happen? There's not a publisher in the country that'll print it. General Douglas MacArthur will see to that. You know MacArthur. You go to him and tell him to stop this. Oh, come on now, please, don't be ridiculous. You just go ahead. You write your article. ( sighs ) Let me... think about it. ( sighs ) Papa! Papa, there's lots of horses. There's lots of horses coming. In a minute, son. I have a problem over here. Hell's bells, I can't see through all this steam. ( hoofbeats rumbling ) ( neighing ) ( soldiers whistling ) ( loud whinnies ) Come on, yah yah! You sure this is the right place, Jack? It's Broken Hill. Jack. ( horse whinnies ) Shame, he gave up a damn good career. Shattuck: Hell, we threw away a damn good retirement, didn't we? ( approaching hoofbeats ) Hey. Welcome back, sir. ( sighs ) You seem to know this country pretty well. ( exhales loudly ) Yeah, well, uh, my father and I used to hunt up here when I was a kid, but that's about it. From here north it's... It's nothing but guesswork, mapwork and a whole lot of luck. North, sir? Well, we got to keep moving, find a place to wait out the army. Quinlain: It's a bit like waiting out God, sir. It can't be done. North is either sparse and dry or wet and cold this time of year. North is as good a choice as any. Travel at night, sir? May I suggest, sir, that we travel by day as much as possible? Make better time. Good then. We'll leave in two hours if you men are up to it. We're not that old, sir. We just look like it. ( chuckles ) Libbey: Mulcahey, you and Quinlain and Shattuck attend to the horses and then get some rest. ( coughs ) ( spits ) What do you think Hardesty'll do? I think if he finds us, he'll try to engage us, sir. I've never been in combat. You have. Perhaps you're better qualified... ( clears throat ) Beg your pardon, sir. This is your detail. I hope it doesn't come to combat, but if it does, there's nothing I can tell you that you won't learn in the first five seconds. ( teletype clicking ) Soldier: Sir, Hardesty's traveling nearly 30 miles an hour. Soldier #2: At that rate, they should engage them by nightfall. Thank you, ma'am. ( phone rings ) ( clicks ) Hello, Flagstaff station. Stationmaster. Where do you think they are now? They're probably in the White Mountains somewhere. And the army? They're probably running around the mountains, looking for a paved road, no? Trying to catch 400 horses they know nothing about. How long since you were in Washington? Oh, Washington. Oh, I bet it... eight... Eight or nine years. You know, uh... the last time I was there, I... I was with your mother. She loved army life. But she hated to travel. Mother did not love the army. She loved you. Well, same difference. Big difference. Let me ask you a question. Are we gonna go on for the rest of our lives just butting heads? Probably. You're just like your mother. No, I'm not. I'm like you. Hey. I'll tell MacArthur you send him your love. How's that? Easy. Whoa now. Whoa. Steady. Shh. Shh. This is just the damn beginning. ( shushes ) Well now. Good boy. ( gun cocks ) ( gunshot ) ( thuds ) We're pushing 'em too damn hard. It's hopeless, God damn it. I'll let you know when it's hopeless, Mr. Shattuck. Until then, we're moving north, hard and fast. Yeah? How many more die before that? I don't know. Some will. If you want to quit, why don't you quit right now? No sir. Well done, sir. ( motors idle ) Damn it. This'll cost us a day. Captain Overton. Sir. You'll proceed north across the river with the mounted troop. Yes sir. And you'll remain here? No, we'll move to the northwest. We'll operate as a pincer with the deserters between us. You will locate them, drive them to us and bring this matter to a close. Yes sir. ( engines crank ) Hardesty: Major, offload the horses. Get these goddamn trucks turned around. Sergeant! Sir! Break out the mounts! Yes sir. Sergeant: Hold up! Turn these trucks around. ( whinnies ) Come on! Soldier: Can I get a mechanic over here? This goddamn radiator's shot. Come on, come on. Yah! Let's go, come on. Giddap. That's it. Come on. Boy, come on. Go go. ( teletype clicking ) ( phones ring ) 15 miles should take us just west of Rock Springs. Jack! Address the lieutenant, Sergeant Mulcahey. Sir, dust, sir. Libbey: That's a mounted patrol. They're at least 30 miles off. So much for grazing the green pastures. Let's get that herd moving, sergeant. Moving where, sir? Up there, Mr. Quinlain. We go up there. It's our only choice. You heard him, boys, let's go. The general sends his apologies, but his schedule is full right now. It can't be that busy. You tell him I'll be back, okay? I don't know... You tell him I will be back tomorrow and the day after that and the day after that! I want a word with that man. It's a fascinating story. Why're you giving it to me? Because there isn't a paper in the country that's willing to be the first to criticize MacArthur. So if I publish photos and file the story in London... Jessica: The press over here will have to pick it up. ( nickers ) Good boy, Ahab. Buxton: Indians! Shattuck: How many? A thousand or so. Damn it, I knew it. Where? ( chuckles ) Montana. What are you talking about, sir? The horses. I don't follow your thought there, lieutenant. ( sighs ) The Sioux reserve is right here just below the Canadian border. There're about 1,000 or so Indians on a lot of land. And they all love horses. Buxton: Well, it's good grazing country too. Are you suggesting the cavalry give its horses to the Indians? That is exactly what I'm suggesting, sergeant. Well, don't that beat all? Army'll just go in there and get 'em back. No, that's the beauty of it. By law, they have to be treated as a separate nation. No federal troops are allowed on the reservation. ( inhales sharply ) It's a fine plan, sir. Well, it's decided then. Indians. Mulcahey: The Indians riding cavalry mounts. My granddaddy'd never forgive me. So when you get to hell, don't tell him. ( sighs ) ( phones ringing ) ( teletype clicking ) Beg your pardon, colonel. These are my men. You mind if I take a look? I could get my ass handed to me for this. ( wind blowing ) Libbey: They're pushing us straight to Hardesty. The main unit'll be ahead. ( indistinct chatter ) Right up there on the ridge. ( clicking ) Soldier: Red mount ready! What's that? It looks like they got us all sewn up. There's nothing that's sewn that can't be un-sewn. Well, I just don't see any way around 'em, Top. Go back to your cavalry tactics manual. Genghis Khan knew a trick or two. You know what that means? Yes sir, I do. Tonight. Lead with the geldings. That way they won't nicker. No mares, no warnings. Let's get back. What if they're ready and waiting? Yeah, what if they shoot? I mean, do we shoot back? They're not the enemy. Like hell they're not. Didn't stop them at Anacostia. To them, we're deserters. They'll be shooting at us. I'll be shooting back. ( gun cocks ) We are not shooting back. Look, all we have to do is break through and we're gone. It'll take them time to regroup and follow. ( sighs ) We're in Montana now. We have a chance. Unload your weapon, James. ( gun clicking ) ( sighs ) ( gun clicks ) ( fire crackles ) ( pans clink ) ( indistinct chatter ) ( hoofbeats rumbling ) What is that? You hear that?! Everybody up! ( shouts ) It's a stampede! It's the horses! Officer #1: Get up! Get up! Buxton: Ride forth! ( overlapping shouts ) Soldier #1: Take cover! Soldier #2: Get out of there now! Officer #2: What's going on there? Soldier #2: Get out of the way! Soldier #1: Look out, they're coming through here. ( shouting ) ( pots clattering ) Yeah! Shattuck: Get out of here! Come on, come on! Buxton: Move move! Work that mount. Quinlain: Come on, yah! Keep 'em moving! Quinlain: Let's go, come on! Yah! Officer #2: Turn 'em round! Turn 'em round. Yah! ( gunshot ) Soldier #2: All right, sir. Buxton: We're leaving. Get them to Ellsworth! ( laughing ) Whoo! We did it! See that captain go down? ( indistinct cheers ) Whoo! It'll take them soldiers days to regroup. It got yours up. Yee-whoo! Still a mounted patrol behind us. Now they know where we are. ( inhales sharply ) Libbey: I'd suggest deliberate and steady going. Take no chances and little forage, sir. All right, Top. ( clicks tongue ) ( sighs ) Quinlain: Christ Almighty. We're gonna have to close that wound or it'll take infection. God. ( breathes deeply ) You ready, Top? Yes, God damn it, do it. ( sizzles ) ( Libbey grunts ) ( ragged gasps ) ( door opens ) The general will see you now. It's been two weeks. I'm getting calls, Owen. Calls from a newspaper in London. Today, I even got an inquiry from the Washington "Chronicle." Rumors are rampant. The President is asking questions. I'm to meet with him next week. I hold you and your daughter responsible. Well, you always did blame somebody else when your plans failed. I have to battle Congress and Roosevelt on a daily basis to keep this army alive. I understand. No, you don't. Hitler is rebuilding the German army. Last month, he met with Mussolini in Venice. There's talk of a pact. Come on now, it's peacetime. The Japanese are expanding into China. War is just around the corner, Owen, modern war. And we're not ready. Damn it, Owen. I have nothing against the horses, but they've outlived their time. But they're soldiers to us. They go in battle with us. They get wounded. Time and time again, they saved our lives. They are not worth what it costs me to feed them. The Germans and the Japanese have tanks. Good tanks, fine tanks in great numbers. We have 12. 12 tanks in the entire United States Army. I can't afford a cavalry we can't use. What about the men? They're good men. They're just trying to do their duty. Put yourself in their shoes. But then... who would be in mine? No, Owen. These soldiers of yours, these renegades, will be caught. They'll face a general court-martial. They'll be convicted and they will be punished appropriately. The horses will be destroyed as I have ordered. This is the time of a Great Depression. The people need heroes! No! Well, God help you when the public finds out about your actions! They'll devour you! Even if they could, they wouldn't. I'm General Douglas MacArthur. The country needs me. And they know it. You're dismissed. General. I'm not in the army... anymore. ( clicks tongue ) Hup! ( whistles ) Lieutenant! Lieutenant! Mulcahey: These six are finished. Ahab's feet are split clean through, Top. They're finished. They'll slow us down. We can't compromise the herd. Form them into a parade. And do it quick before the 12th is on us. Top? Do not look to Top for confirmation! I gave a direct order. Oh, shit. It had to come to this, didn't it? At least we're not herding them into pits and slaughtering them. ( gun clicks ) Libbey: Lieutenant. I'll handle it. ( gunshot ) ( gunshot ) ( gun clicks ) ( gunshot ) ( gunshot echoes ) We've got them, sergeant. Let's go! ( gun clicks ) ( gunshot ) ( thuds ) ( gun clicks ) ( gunshot ) ( thuds ) ( nickers ) I'll see you in hell, Ahab. ( gun clicks ) ( thuds ) Let's move out. ( engines rumble ) Colonel! Sir, they were sighted northeast of here. My opinion is they're attempting to cross into the Sioux reserve. Very well. We'll move to flank them. Sir. Move about smartly, corporal. ( phones ring ) Good move, Buxton. Soldier: As reported, they may be planning on crossing into the Sioux reserve northeast of Colonel Hardesty. Oh, good move. ( man chatters ) Montana. I'll cable London. Man: Uh, usually within two hours. Yes, we do handle it. ( whinnies ) Come on, come on. ( phones ringing, teletype clacking ) Soldier: They cut 'em off. Hup! Mulcahey, scout the left and southern flanks. Hup! ( kisses ) ♪ ♪ Whoa! Get after him! Yah! No! Sergeant, I order you to stop! ( gunshot ) ( sighs ) Ain't nothing more that can be done for him now. He was following an order. My order. You gave a soldier an order. He obeyed. There's always a price. We've got to keep moving, sir. We've got the 12th on our ass and we're flanked over there. ( sighs ) You think we can get past them to the reserve? No sir. Well, then it's Canada. Canada? Buxton: We'll have to make a run for it and... just pray there's no one at the border. Mount up. What about Mulcahey? If you want to give him a funeral, Shattuck, start digging. Ready when you are, sir. ♪ ♪ Corporal, organize a detail. Prepare Mr. Mulcahey's body for transportation. What are you doing, sergeant? We have to keep after those men. Take charge of it for proper burial. Sergeant, this man was a renegade and a thief. There's been no court, no review. This man was a soldier. We'll treat him with dignity, captain. You'll face charges for this. Sir, if you wish to pursue and single-handedly capture them, I'm sure the War Department will commend you. But not one of my men moves till this soldier is taken care of. There's no sign of 'em. How do you figure that? Libbey: It's Mulcahey. He took care of their horses better than anyone. They're paying their respects and giving us time. You used a dead man, Jack. Goddamn right, I did. And I'd do it again. That'll be Hardesty coming to intercept us. ( Buxton sighs ) All right, this is us. This is Milk River at the Canadian border and this is Hardesty. Buxton: The main body of the 23rd will probably cut us off about here. I'm too goddamn old for this, Jack. Quit. A whole goddamn regiment's chasing us, Jack. I don't even know what we're doing anymore! You're free to back out, James. You too, Sean. With your permission, sir. ( sighs ) We traveled nearly 2,000 miles together. If you men want to stop now... ( grunts ) you go right ahead. You got no blame from me. Christ on a crutch. Hell, boys, I... I've never been a quitter. And neither is Shattuck. Are you? No, I'll stick, goddamn son of a bitch! Come on! Well then, let's go to Canada. ( clicks tongue ) Come! Hyah hyah! Hey hey! Hey! ( whistles ) ♪ ♪ Shattuck: Go! ( shouting, whistling ) ( soldier shouting ) All right, you men, this is... Libbey: To the right is Milk River and the Canadian border. ( men shout ) That's the main encampment over there. Two miles, I'd say. They're in a good position. They'll move fast when they spot us. I suggest we move slow so we don't raise dust. We'll rest the remounts for the final dash. We might just make it. Yes sir. We might. Good afternoon, this area's restricted. We're the press, corporal. No, civilians allowed. This is Miss Jessica Stuart. And I'm Evan Buckley, a photographer with the "London Tribune." Please step out of the car, Miss Stuart. I'm going to escort Miss Stuart to Colonel Hardesty. We'll have to detain you here, sir. ( car gear shifts ) Am I under arrest, colonel? You're way off-limits here, Miss Stuart. You will be detained until this exercise is over. As for the deserters, I've been ordered to shoot to kill if necessary. That's official from MacArthur himself. Not many men get that order. I have the privilege of attacking my own men... again. Twice in one career. You could choose to ignore it. I won't. I've been taught to obey and follow orders. No, I will not do otherwise, Miss Stuart. Being army yourself, you should understand. The Chief of Staff is building a new modern army out of the ruins of the old. This is insanity. ( scoffs ) Certainly. What would you have me do? Give them a chance. File a protest with MacArthur. I already have. Then file another. I've sent a wire. Wait for an answer. I have my answer, Miss Stuart! If you think I won't report this, then think again. When you fire on those men, I will witness it and I will not be silent. Corporal. Corporal: Sir. Keep Miss Stuart company. Officer: Can't you give me a hand here? Soldier: Yes sir, what do you need? Officer: I got four of these. You want to spread 'em out? Soldier: Right. Soldier: Chaps are right here. Contact headquarters. Advise them we have the renegades in sight and under the gun. Soldier: Yeah, right there. Buxton: Mounties. Think they're there to stop us? No, Sean, they're waiting with cookies and milk. A damned white flag? Maybe they're surrendering. ( light laughter ) ♪ ♪ You're outmanned and outgunned, lieutenant. It looks like you've lost a good number horses. We can still save what's left. You'd risk your life, your men's lives on a whim? They're on the table. Christ, Jack. We got four 75mm howitzers on your flank. Orders are "Shoot to kill." Give it up, man. Stand at court. At least there's some honor in that. We're not surrendering the horses. You do whatever you have to do. Forrest: He's young and he's headstrong. You and the others are just plain fools, Sergeant Libbey. In your eyes, I suppose so. ♪ ♪ Let's go! ( engines start ) Officer: Forward! Soldier: Move it out! Look sharp! ( soldiers shouting ) Well, we're pretty spread out for a dash. And it's gonna have to be a dash. Spread out ain't so bad. Is it, Mr. Quinlain? Not a bit. Looks like I lead... with your permission, sir. Take the point, sergeant. ♪ ♪ Take the right flank, Mr. Shattuck. ♪ ♪ I reckon we can take it from here, sir. Meaning what? Shattuck, Quinlain and me, we're kind of like the buffalo. We've had our day. Hell, we're lucky we lived this long. But it doesn't have to end for you here. You can turn back now, stand the court. Hell, even blame it on us. I'd be honored to take the blame for any crime you committed. Are you suggesting I relinquish command of this detail, sergeant? No sir. Good then. Carry on. ♪ ♪ Come on, Quinlain. Hello, darling. Did you miss me? ( bugle playing ) ♪ ♪ Follow them, follow them, follow them! ( bugle playing ) Shattuck: Yah yah! ( whistling ) ( soldiers chatter ) Ready 5°. My God.

( whistling ) They fired high and wide. Yeah, it would appear so. Forrest never was much of an artilleryman. Like hell. We under arrest, sergeant? Have you broken a law in Canada? Well, we came over the river uninvited. That you did, but I consider it a minor infraction. What are your plans for the horses, lieutenant? Well, only to keep them alive. And what about you lads? Are you gonna make yourselves useful? Well, it'd be nice to have a new bunch of fellas to tell my lies to. ( chuckles ) ( clicking ) ( chuckles ) Well... I'm glad somebody else likes horses. Well, we made it, sir. 2,000 miles. It was a long story about a quick decision. Where are you headed? I reckon I've spent enough time in the army. Thinkin' about the Yukon. See what that looks like. Alaska? Good God. Well, we've been heading north for so long, it's kinda hard to change direction. ( chuckles ) And you? Well... you told me once that you hated what this country was becoming. Well, I do too. I want to help change it. I'm gonna go back and stand the court. I hope you kick their ass, lieutenant. I do too, Top. ( chuckles ) You take care, Jack. You too, sir.
