Are we getting together tonight, my little love muffin? - Del, please be serious. You've gotta sell your songs to Mister Mega or we'll never get together. In fact, he's here now to... - Come on, my little minuet. I know you love it when I bite your little earsy wearsies. - Del. - And you've got the cutest little earsy wearsies I know. - And you've got the cutest little buns in the business. - And you've got the cutest little... - Hello, mister romance in the pants. If you wanna live in hearts and flowers land with your sweet bunny muffin, then why don't you bring all your brilliant new tunes over today. Or maybe... - Great, Mister Mega. I'm working on a real hot tune now. It's a fabuloso fave classic hot number one with a bullet top 10 killer ground breaker hit, smash-a-roo chart buster. I just need one more line. - Try the unemployment line. Listen, Del, you've got 47 minutes to deliver your nothing-burger hit. - Wait, Mister Mega, listen to this. - Yeah? You listen to this. - Call for you on line number 726.

What a great tune. I can actually remember it. Did you write that? - In Flooby Nooby, songs like that, they write themselves. - What do you mean? - You think too much to write a great song. You've got to feel all the emotions. Passion. Pain. Pasta. Follow me, son. I'll show you what I mean. - What's going on? How come the trees are getting smaller? - Don't you know? Perspective is a myth. In your world, all objects are afraid of being eaten by humans so they puff themselves up, but here in Flooby Nooby we all love everything. So there's no need for puffery. Don't believe me. Go ahead and pet that dog. You're a stranger here so he's not sure whether you're gonna eat him. All you have to do is let go with some music. You're not feeling it, Del. It's got to come from your heart. Oh that's from your pancreas. Up a little bit and to the right. You're just not getting it. But I know someone who can show you how. - Who? Who? I've got to know. - Well, he's really quite busy. You know these intellectuals. - Please. Who? - Some call him a brilliant scholar. Some call him a learned guru. And then some call him the all knowing sage. But most folks call him the wise one. Course I get to call him Gus. - Yeah. That's what I want. Where is he? - Well fortunately, the wise one is everywhere at all times. Remember, only a few mortals are lucky enough to be in the presence of this enlightened being who I call Gus. - This has got to help me. How else am I going to write that perfect tune?

He changed my life. - Oh please. Wise One. Tell me how to write the perfect song. - My poor wandering pilgrim. The truth path is not to be found outside but within you. You must be cleansed and when you have made your soul calm and pure, the proper road to enlightenment will be revealed before your eyes. Discover the purity of perfection, not the perfection of purity. Remember my son, just as one slice into a loaf of bread produces two pieces, you must multiply your wisdom. Oh my innocent one, listen not with your ears but with your heart. See not with your eyes but with your soul. Feel not with your fingers but with your spirit. Smell not with your nose but with your essence. Like a jewel ring hidden in a loaf of bread. Take only the wheat. Leave the chaff behind you. You are hungry my son and wisdom nourishes us all. Your goal is the state of oneness of being, not the being of oneness. My lost young traveler, like the sands of time through the hourglass of our lives, mourn not the wild seas of yesterday, but wind yourself round the ship past of today and let the winds of wisdom blow you to a peaceful tomorrow and to the calm safe harbor the day after tomorrow.

Oh Didi, I'm so happy to see you. - Come on quick. We've got to hurry. - Am I late for the meeting? - Oh Mister Mega's not happy. Where have you been? - Didi, you won't believe what happened. I got lost in some weird cloverleaf and I ended up in this odd town called Flooby Nooby. Then I met this hamburger and fry. I danced on a beach with an ear. Then I was trapped in this hotel room with a psychopathic bellhop. And the wise one kept having these things rollover his head. - Mister Mega will never believe you. - Well he'll believe these songs. - Wait. This isn't the way. You know as long as I've worked here, I still get lost. - Look at the time. I've missed my meeting for sure. Wait, I hear someone coming. We're saved. - Did you hear about the man who's always bald? His mother was frightened by a nudist. Why does an ostrich have such a long neck? Because its head is so far from its body. Why must you be careful when it's raining cats and dogs?
