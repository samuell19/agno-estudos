[ Panting ] [ Dogs barking ] [ Panting ] - US Marshal! Stop! Stop running! Hold it right there! Get on your knees! Hands in the air! Where is he? Where is he? [ Dogs barking ] - [Man]: With your support, we can make this community our family. [ Applause ] - Run! Run! - Melanie? Tom just finished his speech. Now, this is a prime photo op. Remember to make eye contact, especially during the walk to the car. - OK. I've done this dog and pony show for two months now. I think I have it down. - Of course you do. Now, let's get you by your husband's side. - Thank you very much. - Hi, honey.- Hey! - Can we get a shot of you two together? Thank you! Very good! - Try a warmer smile next time. That one felt a bit forced. You look beautiful, though. - You never even voted before you met him. It's Tom's dream, not yours. - I voted! And I'm doing this 'cause I love my husband. - Yeah, but you're not in love with him. - Oh, I'm happy to hear you believe I've spent the last 8 years in a loveless marriage. Gee! - Mm-mm. No. I think you've spent 8 years hiding in a controlling one. - [Sighing]: Look. I chose to marry Tom. And everything that entailed. - Hey, don't think I don't see you! I want you here 5:00 sharp tomorrow. We need to double your sprints! [ Laughing ] What? - Sorry. - Someone has to crack the whip with you gone! - You're doing an amazing job. Really. To tell you the truth, I really miss this. I like the satin. - Thank God. Me too. - Yeah? Oh, it's gonna look so pretty. - Come on! - Tough break, man. - Stay back! Stay back! - Don't start something you can't finish. - You're the one that gonna be finished, punk. [ All cheering ] - Sir, take a look. There's a situation brewing in the South Block. It's Carlson. The man with a target on his back. Give him a second. He'll take the third one down. - Let him finish. Then end it. [ Grunting ] A safer future... Today. [ Tape rewinding ] [ Knocking on door ] Enter. He'll be right out, George. What is that? Four fights this month? - Self-defence. - Assault. But that's beside the point. You're a marked man, top of the food chain, and I can't have that. I need to get you out of the equation. - I'm not going back to solitary. - You'll go where I say you go. I'm putting you on work furlough. It's hard work, pays $4.84 a week... ...and it gets you out of my prison. But I can't put a murderer into general population. Doesn't look good. So I'm assigning you to my farm detail. Starting tomorrow. [ Knocking on door ] Enter! - Oh! I'm sorry. I saw George. I didn't realize-- Oh. - Nonsense. We're done here. - Thank you. - Hey.- Hi. - Mr. Carlson! This is my wife. She teaches GED classes here at the prison. She also oversees everything at the farm. George? Mr. Carlson will be joining us at the farm tomorrow. - Oh. - Yes, sir? - Could you take this prisoner back to the block, please? We're having an impromptu strategy session at the house tonight. You'll have to make some appetizers. - Oh. OK. - Oh, Melanie. There's that tone again. This is for us. You know that. Mayor is just one step in the long path to governor. - To governor. OK. - We were just assured a prominent placement in tomorrow's paper. - Hal keeps flip-flopping on his contribution. - You get his wife to sign off on your platform, and Hal will follow. - I didn't know how many people were coming. I hope there's enough food. - Oh, I should have called. No one else was able to commit on such short notice. - Oh. OK, well, more for us! - I'm sorry, Melanie, but I had dinner on the way over. - No apology necessary. Tom, can I speak-- - Not right now. We should go work in the office. - Mm-hmm. No need to put you through the boring details. - Why don't you have a bath? I'll be up in a while. [ Scoffing ] [ Grumbling ] - Carlson? - Yeah. - Welcome to farm detail. Just call me Dale. I don't care much for that last-name thing. So what are you good at, Jack? - I'm a mechanic. - Well, I can work with that. Lot that needs fixing around here. - So you found her earring? That's a little odd, don't you think? - It was probably just a loose backing. - Hmm. So what'll happen after the election? Will he finally let you go back to coaching? Or the big question, children? - Well, Amy, it's not that simple. There are huge expectations of Tom, and-- - Oh, Melanie! You used to love life! You'd take it on! Now you just let it pass you by! Being with Tom's changed you. - I need to figure some stuff out. Let it go. - Well... I'm feeling a bit parched. - Amy! - I think a tall glass of hot prison men will do nicely, hmm? - You're about to be married! To a prison guard! - Fantasies? The stuff a good marriage is based on? Maybe half-up, half-down. I don't know. The hairdresser thinks-- [ Clearing throat ] Mmm! That hit the spot! Oh, I'm so sorry. - I apologize. She didn't realize the drain was open. It's fine, John. It was our mistake. - No, you know what? It's my fault. I should have warned you. - Here. - Appreciate it. - Anyway, um... We'll leave you to your work. Amy! Amy! - See ya. - Paula and I met with an image consultant today. She had some interesting suggestions. I think she'll be a big help. - Great! Oh, my Saturday class is ready to take the GED. Just need to set up a testing time. - Whenever you like. So, we talked it over with the image consultant, and we agreed that it's best if you aren't in Amy's bridal party. We'd like you to step down. - What? No! Absolutely not! - Darling... Impression is everything! A candidate's wife shouldn't be in a prison guard's wedding party! It doesn't look good! - Amy and George are my two oldest friends! Tom, they introduced us! - I know, and I'm thankful. But we've outgrown those friendships. Deep down, you know we have. - Did you return Paula's earring? - So that's what this is all about. Paula is my campaign manager. Nothing more. Trust me. Trust me. - I trust you. - Good. Then you'll do this. For us. [ Engine sputtering ] [ Grumbling ] [ Phone ringing ] - Dale here. - Hi, it's Melanie. My car won't start. Could you send someone over? Thanks. - Jack! Get on up to the house. - I know, Tom. I should have left earlier. No, don't send a car yet! Just wait and see what happens. I apolo-- Tom? Thank you for coming. It just-- it won't start, and I'm running really, really late. - Well, late's my specialty. At least that's what Mother told me. [ Engine sputtering ] - It's old. [ Engine starting ] Thank you. You really saved me. - Well, I know cars. I'm sorry. Someone needs to tell you this. You look beautiful in that dress. - Thank you. - Melanie! Where are you going? Tom hasn't even given his speech yet! - Um... I'm not feeling well. - There's a lot riding on this appearance. Your husband needs you at his side. - He'll be fine. He's-- he's got you. - Is this about that earring? Tom told me all about it. You've got the wrong idea, Mel. I see Tom as... a mentor. We don't want your absence to become a focal point. - I'm confident you'll make sure that doesn't happen. Just make any excuses you need to, OK? I'm gonna go. Look, they're taking their GED. I should get back in there. - I wanted to see how you were feeling. Paula said you were very ill. - I'm feeling much better today. - Good. Have you told Amy you won't be part of her wedding? - No. And I'm not going to. - This isn't something I expected to debate further. I made a simple request, and I feel strongly about it. That should be enough. - You know, I've also decided that this is my last GED class. - I don't think this is an appropriate time to have that discussion. - There's nothing to discuss. For years now, I've put my life on hold, while helping you get whatever you want out of yours. I'm not your campaign manager, and I'm not one of your subordinates. I'm supposed to be your partner. - You picked a hell of a time for this! But I see your point. You've made a lot of sacrifices, and I appreciate that. - Thank you. But right now, I just wanna get back in there and do my job. OK? - By all means. It's time to make our dreams of tomorrow a reality today. Under my leadership, this city will-- [ Knocking on door ] Enter! New growth... and vitality. Well, this is a surprise! Did I forget a meeting? - No. I just thought I'd familiarize you with some hot topics for the debate. - I'll, uh... ...consider them. Very carefully. [ Knocking on door ] Enter. Mr. Carlson! Have a seat. I'll be right with you. Miss Simms! Thank you for bringing this by. You've given me a lot to think about. - You're more than welcome. - He'll be right out, George. So! Mr. Carlson. How are you enjoying work furlough? - It's fine. - Good. Here's the rub. You're gonna be charged with assault on those other inmates. The injured parties are willing to testify that you attacked them. - Like I said, it was self-defence. - Next, you'll be telling me that you're not a killer. That's a nasty bit of business you did to get in here. Yeah... Two years in on a 16-year sentence? Throw in the assaults, we're talking about life imprisonment. [ Beeping ] [ Gasping ] - What are you doing here? - I'll take that. - You should be gone. They'll be looking for you. - That's the beauty of an electric fence. No one thinks you're gonna run. Take your passport. - What? You have a gun, money, my car. You don't need me! - We both know I'll never make it off the property without you. Come on! Let's go! Let's go! You need to get out of that Barbara Bush outfit into something less conspicuous. I'll turn around. [ Grunting ] You're making really hard for me to be nice to you. - OK, I'll get you off the property. And then you'll let me go! - Put the bag in the back seat. Get in! Close the door! - I said I'd get you off the property, OK? So just trust me to do that. Why don't you get on the floor, and I'll honk the horn as I approach the guards' gate. They'll let me pass through without stopping. - Start the car. [ Engine starting ] Nice and slow. Like normal. Relax. [ Horn honking ] Just relax. - We're through. - OK. OK. Well done. - Just, um... just pick a place to stop, and I'll get out. You can go wherever you wanna go. - That's not an option. - We had a deal! - No, you assumed we did. - What? - We gotta change the plates. Keep driving. [ Both laughing ] Just relax. Just hug me. [ Engine starting ] Get in the trunk. - What? - Get in the trunk now. - No! No! - Get in the trunk now! - No, please! - Get in! [ Sobbing ] [ Engine starting ] Hello? Help! HELP, I'M IN THE TRUNK! HELP, SOMEBODY! SOMEBODY HELP ME! I'M IN THE TRUNK! [ Rumbling ] - Who's winning? - Cougars. You a fan? - Aren't we all? I don't suppose you could tell me which highway would take me to the Canadian border. - I could tell you, but I won't. - Really? And why, may I ask, is that? - Well, because then, you'll leave! - For now. I'll be back later this week. What are you doing Thursday? - Working here till 6:00. - I'll see you at 6:00 on the dot, then. How about those directions? - Oh! Nothing to it. You just jump on the 5, and keep heading north. If you don't hit Canada, you're going the wrong way. - Well, see ya Thursday. - See ya. - Help! Somebody help me! Help me! Please, help me! [ Train horn blowing ] Help, somebody! Somebody, I'm in the trunk! [ Engine starting ] - Get out! Come on! [ Both grunting ] Dammit! Dammit! You-- Come on. [ Grunting ] You stay here. You hear me? Don't move. Turn around. Turn around! Don't move. Let's go. Walk this way. Straight ahead. - You were in prison for murder. Weren't you? You gonna kill me too? - Any reason to believe your wife was a willing participant? - Willing? How dare you? - Our preliminary investigation suggests it is a possibility. She did drive off the property with Mr. Carlson. - He had a gun on her. He stole it from the safe, along with some cash. - And your wife's passport. - You don't know Melanie. She's... I don't know how to describe it. She's not capable of anything like this. It's not in her nature. - And you are? - Paula Simms. I'm Mr. Stone's campaign manager. - Mm-hmm. - Mr. Stone, do you think any of this has to do with your running for mayor? - My wife's been kidnapped by a convicted murderer, and you're standing here asking me questions like these? Find my wife! - There is an APB out, and I'm confident we'll get a hit. There are roadblocks on all the highways, although by now they may be out of state. We're checking with other jurisdictions. In the meantime, I recommend that you put out a plea. A personal plea. It may go a long way with people who may have seen them. - Mr. Stone? We'll give you time to collect your thoughts, and then advise you on what you need to say. - I know what to say. - Mr. Stone will be more than prepared. If you'll excuse us. - Certainly. - Those two are sleeping together. - Definitely. - Tell me something. Was the flirting all part of your plan? To gain my trust, so my guard would be down when you made your move? - No. - Then you must care for me in some way. Means you won't kill me. Why are we stopping here? - We'll spend the night here. Turn around. - Why? - I have to tie you up again. Turn around! - In times like these, it's important to remain focused. Bringing Melanie home, and the capture of Jack Carlson, are my number-one priorities. I stand firm thanks to the support of this community. Melanie... If you can see this... I love you. Thank you. - Mr. Stone! - Now, I wanna make it clear that Mr. Carlson is considered armed and dangerous. If you know of his whereabouts, or Mrs. Stone's, please don't hesitate to call your local law enforcement. [ Panting ] [ Both grunting ] - Get off of me! - You better hope I remember the way back! - So why don't you just shoot me? Get it over with! - The gunshots might have drawn attention. We gotta keep moving. - Great, thanks. Wyatt just took a statement from a gas station cashier. She said Carlson asked for directions to Canada. She also said he seemed like he was posing for the security camera. Wyatt is sending us a copy. - Sounds like he was planting a witness to make us believe he's headed for the border. Smart move. It'll be fun tracking this boy. - Wait here. Come on. Come on! Let me get some air in here. - You owned a garage? That your wife? Your brother? - Ex-wife. Ex-friend. - Did they have an affair? - I wouldn't if I were you. You'll get lost, and you won't like what finds you. - Are they the reason you're in prison? Why are you doing this? No! - I'm getting supplies. - Help! Help! Help! Help! - Yup, that's definitely our guy. - He chose a couple maps. Did Wyatt find out what they were? - He said the cashier didn't know because they were free. - I need to know which maps he chose. - I'll get on it right away. I hope they can enhance the image, but don't expect miracles. - Thank you. [ Grunting ] - Need some lures? - Uh, I'm OK, thanks. I don't suppose you got some electronics? [ Scoffing ] - You city folk are all the same, eh? Come up here to get away, and just can't live without your camcorders and video games. There they are. [ Grunting ] [ Grunting ] - Yeah, I'll take the phone and the recorder. - Phone, and recorder. Think you could use some batteries, too. Here. On the house. - Thanks. I'll need 'em. Heading up to Oregon. - Oh, it's beautiful up there this time of year. Yeah. [ Grunting ] [ Dialling ] - [Woman]: Hello? - It's Jack. I need to see you. - Oh! [ Grunting ] [ Screaming ] [ Grunting ] [ Rustling ] [ Gasping ] - Melanie! - I'm over here! Something's chasing me! - Are you OK? - Thank you. - You're bleeding. Let's get outta here. - You sure about that? All right, great. Mrs. Stone's licence plate was tagged in Portland. Except it wasn't on her car. Switched with an SUV. Driver says it only could have happened in one place: a rest stop. Troopers have started to canvas. - Should we inform the husband? - Let's see what shakes out. He's too busy giving interviews. - He's working that press angle pretty hard. - More like the election angle. Courting the sympathy vote. - Yeah? If his wife dies, he could end up in the mayor's office. - You're lucky you don't need stitches. - Yeah, I don't feel very lucky. - OK. I'm gonna tell you why I did this. And then you can decide what you wanna do. This is a recording of your husband... ...blackmailing me to kill you. [ Scoffing ] - You're just trying to manipulate me. It's part of your sick game. - Listen to this. - You're gonna be charged with assault on those other inmates. The injured parties are willing to testify that you attacked them. That's a nasty bit of business you did to get in here. Two years in on a 16-year sentence? Throw in the assaults, we're talking about life imprisonment. - You can't do that. You can't. - But I have. I just gave the other inmates the opportunity to flip their assault charges onto you. - You bastard! - I'd be willing to bet you'd do just about anything to get out of here. For a chance to be a free man. - What do you have in mind? - Only what comes naturally to you. Kidnap my wife and kill her. [Echoing]: You'll be a free man. Kill her. - Why? - I've seen the way you look at Melanie. Know what you'd like to do to her. I'll make sure you escape and aren't caught. - You can't guarantee that. - I can... ...and will. To start... The security code for my house. Use my wife to get off the property. Do what you want with her. Dump the body and escape across the border before nightfall. [Chuckling]: Well done, Carlson, well done. - Take this... ...and the tape, to the police. Your husband doesn't realize he left the recorder on. He doesn't think any evidence exists. Melanie. The best way to protect yourself is to go to the police. - All right... - Delaney here. That's great. Listen up! We just got another sighting. Store owner, just outside of Pullman. Our suspect used to own a cabin in the area. So pack it up, we're going in! - I hate that I had to do things this way. But I needed to get you away from him. If I didn't, he just would have found a better inmate for the job, and you would have been dead by now. I don't expect you to believe me. But my ex-wife and her boyfriend framed me for the murder of a man who's still alive. I need to find him. - Why didn't you just tell me? Give me the tape? Why did you have to kidnap me? - 'Cause you would have helped me escape. I needed out of prison. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! - Why? Why would he do this? - We don't take cards. - Thanks, Bernie. Wyatt! Our man purchased a disposable phone. Nearest cell tower should give us a run-down on any calls. - And then what? - Start calling and cross-checking. Find out if he reached out and touched someone. Once we get a number, we should be able to triangulate his exact location. Red-flag anything in Oregon. - Oregon? - That's where he said he was headed next. - Right. Just like he was going to Canada. - Maybe we can knock on his door and ask for ourselves. All right, guys, let's find Carlson's cabin! - You said if I listened... you'd let me go. - Wait. - You can go anywhere you want. If you decide you wanna call the police, just dial in your number from the cell phone. They'll track the signal and find you. I only spent $100 on supplies. The rest is all there. I'll walk you to the access road. - US Marshals! - Dammit! Where the hell is he? - It's just... just hikers. You should probably catch up to them. - Suspect was here just a few hours ago. He may be close, if he's on foot. Mrs. Stone may or may not still be with him. Fan out in circular sweeps. There's a lot of other cabins. We're gonna check 'em all. - John! Forty-nine calls went through the local cell tower since 3:00 this morning. One call was made to a Joyce Winters. That's Carlson's ex-wife. She's in Everett, Washington. - Nice job, Wyatt. Looks like we're gonna meet the ex-Mrs. Carlson. - I don't think we should stay here any longer than we have to. I've been throwing the cops off our trail wherever I can, but it's only a matter of time. - Jack, how can you be sure this man you're looking for is alive? - I'm not. I just know a woman saw him board a bus to Idaho the day after I supposedly murdered him. - And the police didn't look into that? - Too much circumstantial evidence already stacked against me. To them, it was open and shut. - Well, obviously they didn't have a body! - Doesn't matter. There was blood, DNA, a murder weapon... And the false testimony of my wife. Let's go. [ Knocking on door ] - Yes? - Stephanie Baker, John Delaney, US Marshals. - You're here about Jack? - That's right. - No offence, but we don't wanna get involved. Jack Carlson's been out of our lives for years now, and we'd like to keep it that way. - We know about the phone call he placed to you this morning. - He said he needed to see me, then hung up. - Yes, we know. The duration of the call was only 6 seconds. Do you think Mr. Carlson was reaching into his past for help? - He won't find that here. Licensed, loaded and waiting. - Well, I guess we're done here. Thanks for your time. Doesn't make any sense. They're so afraid, they keep a loaded gun by the front door, but they won't take 5 minutes to talk to us? - You think they know where he went? - That clever son of a bitch has led us astray again. He's somewhere we haven't even considered yet. - Why do you think your ex-wife lied? - My guess? So she could sell my business, clean out my bank account, and marry the man she was having an affair with. - Oh, Jack, I'm sorry. - No, don't be. She was with a doctor who got his licence revoked for selling illegal prescriptions. I believed her when she begged for a second chance. - Yeah, well, I think anyone would make that mistake. - No, no. They would have seen the signs. My business was thriving. I had 8 mechanics doing custom work. And exactly one week after I took her back, Tim, the young guy standing next to me in the photo, he starts an argument with me out of nowhere. Makes sure I threaten him in front of everyone. Next day, Tim's blood is found all over the garage, in the trunk of my car, and my hunting knife is found in a nearby dumpster, with traces of Tim's skin and DNA. I can't believe they found us. We need to move, fast. - OK. - Get that tape to the cops as soon as you can. I'm gonna find Tim, and get my life back. - Now boarding for Sandpoint! Now boarding for Sandpoint! - OK. - So where do we start looking for Tim? - What are you doing here? - I don't know. - Come on, come on. I love that you want to do this with me, but I'm a fugitive wanted for murder. And kidnapping! I'm being hunted. I can't make you an accessory. - Then we'll go to the police. You'll turn yourself in. Once they hear that tape, you won't be charged with kidnapping. I'll make them re-open your case! You'll get a fair trial, Jack, I promise! - The system failed me once already. And it cost me two years. I can't do a full 16! I have to do this on my own, OK? - We'll figure out how to do it together without getting caught! Jack? Jack? We gotta go. - OK. This is an old bank statement. I got it right after Joyce cleaned out our account. She made two $10,000 wire transfers to someone at the mail stop in Standpoint, Idaho, right after my arrest. - You think Tim's there. - Tell video forensics I want my map. Now! - All right. I've got the husband on video conferencing. Here we go. - Have you found her? - No, I'm sorry, we haven't. - Then why are we talking? - There are signs that Melanie may have been injured by Mr. Carlson. We found a bloody cloth and a torn T-shirt. We're running some tests. - You think he killed her? - It's too early to determine anything like that. It wasn't a significant amount of blood. - I see. Why don't you contact me when you know for sure? - I really dislike that man. - Just be glad you're not the one married to him! - Hi. I'd like some information regarding two wire transfers. - You sending or receiving? - Neither. It's actually transfers my wife sent a few years ago. I'd like to know who claimed them. - Why not ask your wife? - We're not on speaking terms. - Messy divorce. - Let me see some ID and I'll see what I can do for you. - Yeah, great. Uh... I actually got this bank statement confirming the wire transfers. - I'm still gonna need to see some ID. - I lost my wallet. - That right? Well, for all I know, you two could be dumpster diving to commit identity fraud. I can get in a lot of trouble. [ Clearing throat ] - Nice shoes! Listen... Help us out, and, uh... They're yours. - Give me the dates, the amounts, and the sender's name. - Joyce Carlson, May 26/05 and June 19/05, both in the amount of $10,000. - Those are large amounts. They'll definitely still be in the system. Hmm... Yup! Here they are. They were sent to a Terrance Scott. I have his address and his driver's licence number, if you'd like. - First, it was directions to Canada. Then he tells the shop owner he's going to Oregon. Next, he phones his ex-wife, and makes us think he's going up there for help. Now, he wants us to think that he's working north-south. Where were those other 3 buses headed? - These are from the gas station. He's grabbed the maps from Idaho. - One of the buses went to Idaho. - Find out where it stopped. Let's mobilize. - Hi. - Who will you be visiting today? - Terrance Scott. - Let me just get you his room number. Scott... - By the way, are these apartments? - Kind of looks like it, doesn't it? No, Windbrook is a long-term care facility. We provide a stable living environment for residents who are unable to care for themselves. Let me get you that room number. Oh! That's cool. You're his first visitors in two years. I'm sure he'll be psyched. - This isn't him. - What? - He's the same age, but that's not Tim. - His chart says he's been in a coma for 5 years. Terrance couldn't have claimed the money! - Well, whoever did must have had his driver's licence, at least. - Tim must have assumed his identity! Which makes sense, given what the guy said about a visitor a few years ago. - One way to know for sure. We'll just check the exact date of the visit and see if it was before the wire transfers. He needed enough time to apply for a driver's licence. - We have to find the new Terrance Scott. - Check witness testimonies, arrest documents, anything in Idaho. All right? - Breathe carefully, people. [ Water running ] [ Sighing ] - I take it the Internet search didn't turn up anything. - Not a trace. No phone, no address, no e-mail, nothing. - I think I have a way to find him. Tom's computer at the prison has access to federal databases. It can link a driver's licence number to a Social Security number or tax information. So if Tim has gotten a job, bought an apartment, rented a car, it'd instantly register his current address. I can do this. I can find him. - It's too risky. You'll have to go back with Tom, pretend you're his wife again. - Well, I think that's my decision to make. I can handle Tom! Jack, you saved my life. I can do this. - You'd actually risk your life for me? But... The answer is still no. I couldn't live with myself if something happened to you. [ Moaning ] [ Ringing ] - Great, thanks. Just picked up a signal from Carson's phone. [ Dog barking ] - US Marshals! Stop! Hold it right there! Get on your knees! Hands in the air! Where is he? Where is he? [ Dogs barking ] - I need to make another public appeal for Melanie. - We picked up 7 points in the polls after the last one. Mentioning the bloody cloth and the T-shirt they found was key. You really think she's gone? - Bet my candidacy on it. [ Phone ringing ] What? I'll be right there. - Melanie, I'm John Delaney. This is my partner, Stephanie Baker. We're the marshals assigned to your kidnapping. - We're very happy you're safe, and weren't seriously hurt. It doesn't always go down that way. - Rarely does. You're lucky we found you. If you'd stayed in his company a little longer, you would have been one hell of a liability. - He had a gun. He said he was gonna kill me. - I guess that's all we need for now. I think your husband's on his way. He'll take you home. - Melanie! We were so scared! - Don't go getting yourself kidnapped again, all right? - I'm so happy you guys are here. - OK, well, we just wanted to see with our own eyes. Get some rest. We'll stop by tomorrow. - Yeah. Tom made us promise we'd only say hello. - Thanks for understanding. Come on, honey, let's get you inside, OK? - Can you give me a minute? - Yeah, sure. - George, keep this safe for me. - Yeah. See you tomorrow, OK? - I'm so glad you're home. I've been lost without you. Haven't been able to sleep. [ Door opening ] - I know why Idaho. - They're having a press conference to talk about your safe return. It's important that you be there. - It should be at the prison. - Why is that? - To show that I still have faith in you, and your ability to protect me and others from harm. I mean... If we could show all those people that I could stand comfortably by your side, among all those prisoners-- - It's a good idea. I'll call Paula, have her arrange it. Thank you all for coming. I'm sure you've heard the miraculous news. Miraculous. Mir-a-cu-lous. Is "miraculous" too much? Yeah, it's too much. - Oh, honey, your tie. It's crooked. - Oh! Thank you. - You know, I was thinking, we should ask Paula to organize some private interviews. You know, get something on the national news? Could really help with your bid for governor. - You're right. - Yeah? - Paula should be on that. I'll be right back. Paula! - Oh, come on! - Paula loves the idea. - Yeah? - We should really be getting down to the press conference. Melanie? - Huh? Yeah. Let me just put my shoes on. - You ready? - Tom? - Mm-hmm? - I missed you. - I missed you too. - Hey. Let's get down there. - Now, remember to hold hands. We want people to see your strength and support for each other in this trying time. - Oh, gosh! I forgot to check a mirror. - No need. You look great. - I'd feel better if I did. I'll be a second. I'll meet you there. George? Thank you! - We gotta go. OK? Thank you all for coming. I'm sure you've heard the miraculous news-- - Sir? Gift from your wife. - What do you have in mind? - Only what comes naturally to you. Kidnap my wife and kill her. - Why? - I've seen the way you look at Melanie. - Mr. Stone! - Know what you'd like to do to her. I'll make sure you escape and aren't caught. - Call my lawyer! - What's going on? - Sir, is this true? - Paula! - Wait till you hear this. No one followed up with the witness who saw the dead guy board a bus to Idaho the day after his murder. - Incredible. Carlson provided copies of bank statements showing wire transfers from his wife to a mail stop in Idaho. How the hell do you just dismiss that? - The case was a lock. They had DNA evidence, and witnesses testifying Carlson fought the dead guy the day of the murder. His own wife helped put him away. - They railroaded him. - Yeah! - Wyatt! Where did those wire transfers lead you? - This is unbelievable. Terrance Scott. He's been living in a vegetative state in a private facility for 5 years now. I pulled his social out of the federal database, and he's got a current address in Portland. They stole his identity. - Federal database. - That's the only place you can get a current address. - She's helping him. That's why he let her go! Track down Mrs. Stone. We're going to Portland! [ Knocking on window ] [ Gasping ] - Oh God! - You found him? - Yeah. - Oh, thank you. Thank you. - Oh God! Come on, let's go. - OK. I don't know how this is gonna turn out. I just wanna say thank you. For everything. - We're gonna prove you're innocent. I promise. Come on. - Yeah? - Hi! I just moved into the building, and I locked my keys and purse in my car. I can't get into my apartment to call AAA. Can I borrow your phone? He's coming. - Make it quick. I'm on my way out. - Thanks. I don't suppose you have the number? - Yeah, I'll get my wallet. - You son of a bitch! [ Grunting ] Two years, Tim! Two years! - What are you gonna do, huh? You gonna kill me? - I've already been convicted of it! - Jack, don't! Don't! - You're gonna confess everything to the police! - Screw you! - It's not worth it! - Hit the ground now! Let's go! Down! Now! - Down! Hurry up! - Get down! Let's go! - I want a deal! I want a deal! I want a deal! You gotta guarantee I don't do any major time. - We already tied Joyce to the wire transfers. - Trust me. I'll give you a nice bow to wrap it all up with. I'm not saying another word until I get a deal. - Give it up, and if it's any good, I'll take it to the DA. - Better not do bad by me. Joyce's husband, Ron. He took care of the DNA. - Oh yeah? How's that? - Mother stabbed me, stitched me up, took bags of my blood for him and Joyce to plant. - It's a good story. Got any proof to back it up? - Yeah. He wrote me two bad scrips for antibiotics. The pharmacy kept them on account of him being on some watch list for selling illegal prescriptions. Check it out. They were written the day after I was murdered. - Give me the name and address of that pharmacy. And if it pans out, I'll get you a deal. - We should charge you with aiding and abetting a fugitive. - Step inside, please. - Seems like your husband was just arrested for the solicitation of your kidnapping and murder. I don't suppose you know anything about a recording that was played. - Jack gave it to me, and he gave me that. It's the alarm code to our house. It's Tom's handwriting. So I hope you can see, Jack kidnapped me to save my life. - So it appears. Mr. Carlson was also wrongfully imprisoned. We're arresting his ex-wife and her husband right now. - So he'll be let free? - I'll do what I can, but ultimately, that'll be up to a judge. - I'd like to see him. - Of course. My partner and I have decided to talk to the judge, see if we can't get you off with time served. Five minutes. - Hey. - Wow. Time served. That's... that's good. - Yeah. Yeah, very. You OK? - Yeah. Hey, you need to follow your strokes through more, so just reach farther. OK, I wanna see some more sprints. Come on! Don't roll your eyes at me! You're on scholarship! I got you for two more years! Let's go. Come on! - Why don't you cut her some slack, and come play hooky with me? - Hi!- Hey. - You just got really lucky. Go. Have a good weekend. - Thanks. - Practice! [ Chuckling ] Wow! Well, you got off work early! - Yeah, you know, thought I'd work on my breast stroke. - Oh yeah? I could help you with that. - You think so? - Uh-huh. Closed captions:Global Vision
