CO-PRODUCERS SUPPORTED BY STARRING IN A FILM BY COUNTRY TEACHER Do you knowwhere I can find the principal?. It's you. I was afraid you'd changed your mind. Wait a moment. Everyone to the playground! No slacking! I see everything! Come along. Sit. Please welcome Mr. Odehnal. He will be teaching you natural sciences. Remember, he has taught truly intelligent children... at a city prep school. Please, colleague, the class is yours. My name is Petr Odehnal. Together we'll study nature. Like it or not, all of us are units of nature. And that's why we have to try to understand nature. If we don't understand nature we can't understand ourselves. I'm going to show you something I found. Can anyone tell us what it is?. - A snail. - No, no, no. Not a snail. What is it?. Come on, children, who knows?. Who knows the correct answer?. What is it called?. - Terezka?. - A snail, what else?. A garden snail! No one's ever heard that before?. No one knows anything, no one's interested, no one cares. Good luck, teacher. It really isn't a snail. Not even a garden snail. What is it?. Just a shell, a little house for a snail. The tenant died, only dead nature's left. There's nothing alive here. But from the shell, we can learn about its life. It's all recorded here. Born here. A tiddler here. It grew and grew. Looks like it got through its first winter here. Here, something happened. Look. Something cracked his shell, maybe a rock, but it mended. You can see it perfectly here. See it?. The little scar. Listen, what are you really doing here?. What do you mean?. What can we offer you?. I don't need anything. You're young, free, taught at prep school in Prague. What are you doing here?. I'll tell you. You messed up. You don't have to say anything. I'm not interested if you're in trouble or were in trouble. But if you actually came here of your own accord, you're crazy. An idealist. And from an educational standpoint you offer us nothing. So... two thousand a month. - Is that OK?. - Of course. "Geist und Nature". Spirit and Nature. 6 months! You'll last no longer. No luxury but for us this is also an investment. This way, you'll get some privacy. - Turn it off! - Why?. Someone's sleeping. Jesus, turn it off! - Why?. - Because someone's... Excuse me. Sorry if I'm in your way. It's OK. Sleep. Just loading some hay and we're off. Goodbye. You dropped something. Thank you. Move it! Start throwing. - Mr. Teacher... - Yes. Please leave it on. That way, I'm less afraid. Excuse me. - May I turn off the light?. - You may. - So, goodnight. - Goodnight. Thank you. Let's try again, Marushka. We're not giving up. Let's press it together. You can investigate up here. You focus here. See?. - Sir, I found something. - Show me. That's moss. You have to soak it or you get nothing. Sir, I've got it! I found a tardigrade! - Let's see. - Show me. I think we've got it! Martin, have a look. See the paws?. - Like a bear. - I want to look too. - OK. - There's another one! - They're in there together! - No. Not together. Each of them lives alone. They don't know about the others. Hello, Professor. Hop in! You're very kind. - Good day. - Good day. - Come sit up here. - Thank you. I have a grandson. It's his birthday soon. He's crazy for that microscope. Know where I can get one?. I'll get you one. Hi. Cheers! Will you be coming to our haystack again?. - I'm very sorry. - Forwhat?. - Forwhat?. - Mary. - What are you doing to me?. - Nothing. - Why don't you notice me?. - Leave me alone. - Can I help?. - Throw me some hay. Up there. Stop it! So what's up with the hay?. Hi. Excuse me. Professor?. Bara?. What are you doing here?. Throw it down here. Walk with me. I'll show you paradise. Your paradise I don't want to see. Can I call you Dad?. You?. You need to be kept on a short leash! - Smoke, Dad. - Stop fucking me around. - Calm down. - When he stops fucking with me! - Chill, Dad. - That's enough! What do you mean, you little shit?. - Please, go and sit down. - Are you going with me or not?. - Leave me alone. - Are you going with me?. - You're coming at least?. - I'll come with you. Don't be stupid. Josef, don't be silly. Fucking wreck! - Put it in first. - What else?. Clutch! Would you like a hit?. And don't be so formal with me. It's funny, professor, meeting like this. Chance is the mother of change, as we've learned, Bara. - Have you tried going deeper?. - We're already at bedrock. My husband dug to here, it let him go no further. Your husband?. He's dead now. I'm sorry. He was such a beautiful young man. I loved him very much. Than he ran off with another woman. Lada was still a baby. I guess she kicked him out because he came back. I made the mistake of taking him back. But... I couldn't love him again. It didn't work anymore. He started drinking. Started beating me up. I know it sounds awful, but when the truck ran over him it was like my salvation. He was on his way back from the pub. Not there. The bathroom. Thank you. I've brought water. - You're wasting water! - She needed to wash up. Tomorrow you bring up the water. Open! You want to break the door?. Let her in. Come. - Can you put it there?. - Yeah. I can do it. Turn it around. - Sweet dreams. - You too. - Thank you. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Hi. - Good morning. - I'm picking cherries. Please, pass me the basket. - Can I help?. - Yeah. Come. - Is it ringing for mass?. - I don't know. Do you believe in God?. I'd like to. But I don't know how. And you've got a girlfriend?. I had one. What happened?. She got married. She's pregnant. I think she's happy. You must be a very good man. Why?. Wishing her so well. I could never do that. I neverforgave him forfinding another. It was too big a betrayal. Why did you leave the prep school?. Imagine teaching at the same school as your mother. Madame Curie. I get it. Is she the same at home?. - No. She's worse. - Jesus, I can't imagine that. Don't you miss Prague out here?. - Not really. - I couldn't be without people. So we're not people?. - Did I say that?. - It's what you think. What do I think?. How can you know what I think?. - To you, we're not people. - Drop it. I've had enough. I don't think like that. - I really like you. - Eat. I've been thinking, we don't fit together. Why?. Next to you I feel really stupid. - That's so not true. - It is. We don't fit together. It's not true. Good. That's enough. Catch! I had a wonderful grandfather. Once, there was a huge boulder in the neighbours' yard. They wanted to build. It was in the way. They tried everything: drills, a jackhammer. No luck. Grandpa couldn't stand the noise any more. He had them bring him a chair. He was blind, he couldn't walk. He felt the rock with his hands and asked me what I saw. We looked for the veins. For me, that boulder was a mountain. He examined it a long time then took a chisel, hammered it, and that huge boulder split in two. It was the most beautiful thing I ever saw. Smells good. Try it. - It does. - It's last summer. You smell nice, too. Sorry, I forgot. I'm an old woman. Coming for lunch?. - I think I'll head home. - Right. You want some coffee?. Yeah, thanks. Hi. Listen. We can't both teach at the same school. I have a proposition. You go back, I'll leave. That's nonsense. Why do you always run away from everything?. You wanted to be a scientist, you ran away. Wanted to teach at a good school, then ran away. Running. You're always running from everything. - Hi, Dad. - Hi. - They treating you well?. - Yeah. I'm glad. Glad?. That he's destroying his life?. It's his life. He's an adult. Deal with it, honey. I'd love your ability to enjoy your own mediocrity. Our mediocrity shouldn't influence his choices. Thank you. Have you called Alena?. She's married, Mum. I don't want to interfere. I still don't understand why you two broke up. You understood each other so well. I'm a homosexual, Mum. But... intelligent people... can still have a quality relationship. Alena needs an ordinary guy, not me. Sex isn't everything. She'd understand. Did you evertell her?. I told her. And everything beautiful between us ended. We can't tell Dad about this. He knows, Mum. He plays it three times a day. I can't stand it anymore. - Give me one. - You shouldn't smoke. Do you have a boyfriend?. No. You shouldn't be alone. Loneliness is terrible. Mum's right. Vlasta... I've brought something! - Hi. - Hi, thank you. - How are you?. - So-so... There comes a wind and there will be misery. And what did the Sybil say?. Winter will follow winter. Paths will not cross. And men will not understand one another. - Don't worry. It'll be OK. - I know what I know. Hi. I have a favourto ask. Could you help my boy study?. I don't know if I'll be much use. But sure. If he wants. I was a poor student too. He probably takes after me. Do you want milk?. I've got one bottle. Yes. - Here. - Thank you. What are you listening to?. Very sad! - Do you want me to explain?. - Yeah. Please, can you turn that off?. We're trying to help you. - Can you pay attention?. - There's no point. - Give it to me. - I will not. I said I'm not giving it to you. Go and study! I apologize. Your average worker bee, the one outside. They're neither male norfemale. They have no gender so can't reproduce. They're there only to work. What we know is that the queen secretes chemicals which suppress the worker bees' sex drive, so they don't goof off, so they work for her. Excuse me. Hello. I'm the school inspector and I'm here to observe. Please, continue... with yourwork. Carry on, teacher, as if I weren't here. But we can look at it another way... we can say that a worker bee's brain... ...is wired to serve its queen. The worker bee is no longer a loser... They... it fights for... Can you explain somehow?. What's that supposed to mean?. I'm waiting. Stop it. Let me go. Why did you come here?. I miss you. Sorry, but it's really over. Coffee or tea?. Peter, I can't stand it without you. Hello. Peter, do you have any coffee?. - Of course. - It's all too much today. Thanks a lot. Do they know about you here?. No. It would make your life a living hell?. I suppose so. So you'll have a sweet life, Mr. Teacher. - That's enough. Thank you. - You're welcome. Have one. No thanks. - You've got somebody here?. - No. Be hard to find someone, wouldn't it?. - I'm not even looking. - I don't believe you. I want to be alone. I told you. For me it's the only solution. Solution for what?. Sorry. I forgot you're such a spiritual guy. You need to be alone with the divine order of nature. Stop it. - Jerk off alone too?. - You're disgusting. That doesn't bother me. I'm a man, I don't get how we're together and I can't touch you. I don't love you. I didn't fall in love with you. It didn't work. The whole thing was a mistake. Can you forgive me?. Of course I forgive you. Now let's fuck. No need to talk about love. For me it makes no sense without love. Good evening. Salutations, Professor. We're happy you could come. I gave the boy that microscope. - Did he like it?. - Sure, but he's bored already. Kids today have everything and nothing interests them. We had nothing but there was always something, some way to goof off around the duck pond. - You can't imagine. - That's beautiful. Gentlemen. A little something. I'm here with Peter. Kids, stop snogging. To the beauty of life. - You promised not to. - One won't hurt. You promised me. - Leave me alone. - Come on. It was only one. - So, ciao. - Cheers! Hi. Fuck, it's dry here! I'm going to fix that. This is my friend. He's come to visit me. Hello. I'm George but everyone calls me Mihi. Mary. Haven't we met before?. I don't know. Where?. I don't know either. Do you work in law?. No. Don't talk to me so formally. - Of course. Sorry. - Hi. Where have I seen you?. Do you work in news?. No. I herd cows. - If we met, it was here. - How big's your herd?. - Big. - Big?. Who am I confusing you with?. Do they get high here?. - Shall we?. - Not me. - What's that?. - Dutch skunk. Want to try?. - So come on. - You coming?. - He's yourfriend?. - Yes. Known each other long?. Boys, drink. You too. - Mary, let's get together. - Give it a rest. You're alone. I'm alone. What do we get?. Nothing! - What's up?. - I've had enough... - Enjoy yourself. - Hold on. You're going already?. Yeah. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Night. When I was a boy, I roasted snails. When the shells cracked we knew they were ready to eat. That's disgusting. How did they taste?. - Like chicken. - I ate worms when I was a girl. I couldn't do that. I ate little children. You used to be more fun. Hey, do you think animals have souls?. - Why shouldn't they?. - What kind could a worm have?. - Small, probably. - Small, big, that's the mystery. I wouldn't want to be a worm. I would. I'd dig into the earth and only come out when I wanted. It's a pity you left. The idiot we've got now's useless. - Wait. - What?. - Back off the boy. - And what am I doing?. Leave him alone. Sonofabitch, you're in love! Hey, don't be afraid, Petey. Be happy you're young. - Why aren't you dancing?. - It's not for me. - You're an idiot. - I am. You're young. A man should dance when he can. Gentlemen, to the beauty of life! What are you really doing here?. I only come at weekends. My grandma lives here. - What do you do?. - Me?. I work with people. - How?. - I headhunt brains from the East. - What kind of brains?. - Capable ones. - That's interesting. - I try to understand people. If you want to get someone you have to map them out, find their weak point. Everyone has one. You have to sense it. It's pretty hard work, but I like it. Have you found my weakness?. - Are you capable?. - I am. Excellent! That's an excellent start. I want to go to law school. Good choice. There are many opportunities for lawyers. Lawyers only steal from people. Why would they steal?. It's just anotherjob, right?. Lawyers are all the same. Stealing from ordinary people! You're talking shit! Do you know any lawyers?. No. And I don't want to. You're such a loser! Hey, kids, enough. Can I have this dance?. - Yeah. - Excuse us. Go after her. Come on, go. - We're going home. - I'm not going anywhere. - I said we're going home! - Let me go! What are you doing, man?. Is this how you treat girls?. - What?. - What're you doing?. Calm down! Get off me! Go with him, please! No way. Peter! Come for a dance. Come dance with me. And you know what?. You can call me Milena. - Peter. - Nice to meet you. How do you like our party?. I'm really enjoying it. There's food here. Come here. We should be quiet. Quiet! She's asleep. Turn it off. Do you hear me?. I dropped the bucket. - A hat for you! - Are you insane?. Be quiet. We have to be quiet! What are you doing?. Sorry. I killed the TV. I better go to bed. - Sorry, Peter. - Get off me! We can go for a threesome. That make you horny?. Go fuck yourself! Let me in, it's my bed. Leave her alone! You hear?. I'll sleep with you then. Quiet. Is she there?. Don't go in there. Hear me?. Let me go! Let me go. Vlasta?. Vlasta, you're still sleeping?. Vlasta?. - What's up?. - Get out of here. - What?. - Get out of here. Wake up. - It's not like it looks. - I don't care. Get going. What's happening?. What is it?. Ciao. What happened here?. Tell me what happened here. Vlasta is dead. - What's the big hurry, man?. - Get that out of the way! So wait! - Here you are, gentlemen. - Thank you. - Hello. - Hello, Professor. - Another beer. - Pay up and go home. - A beer or some food?. - Just a beer. Calm down, boy! - Give me a beer. - Pay and get out. - Give me a beer! - Don't shout. Get out. - Shut your cunt! - What did you say?. - Shut your cunt! - Get out of this bar. - You showed him. - Enough of his shit. - I'll pay for him. - Everything?. - Another beer?. - No, thanks. What's up?. I tried calling her. She hung up on me. I'm sorry about what happened. Don't worry. She'll come back. She won't. You have to learn to believe in yourself. You're right. I should. But how's it done?. Try liking yourself more. That doesn't work. There's no reason. Eat up, girls. Aren't you a hungry one?. Hi. Can I come in?. Hi. Hi. - What do you need?. - Will you help me?. Of course. Sit here. - Would you like tea or... - No thanks. - Let's see. - I understand Pythagoras, but I don't know how it applies to this. Wait. Let's write this down. R- squared equals (R minus V)- squared... plus U-squared... Now... You try it. The parentheses first. R- squared equals... R minus V... times R minus V... - What's left?. - plus U-squared. Now multiply the parentheses. R- squared is... R- squared is... R-squared... minus RV... minus RV... minus... V times... minus V equals... Negative times negative gives us... - Plus. - So negative V times negative V... - Positive V-squared! - Excellent. - Is it part of an engine?. - Something smaller. A little engine?. - A watch. - Really?. What is it?. I don't know. Hi, Betty. Good girl. It's herfirst one?. The head's swelling. It has to come out. Grab on to her hooves. 10cm up. Push, Betty! Mary. The cow's giving birth. Mary, get up. The cow's giving birth. - What?. - The cow's giving birth. Let's go. You were supposed to watch her. I haven't seen her like that in a long time. She reminded me of Dad. I got this scarfrom him. What happened?. When he started hitting Mum again, I grabbed a chair... I hit him over the head. - How old were you?. - I don't know. 8 or 9. They always fought. The worst was when Mum started drinking too. She turned really nasty. Dad tried to be better then. I hated them both. Just stay calm, don't panic. You know this stuff. I know you'll pass. Ciao. Hi. How'd it go?. I aced it. I'm so happy. Know what?. You're a good kid. - Thank you. - Come sit a while. I've got work to do. Thank you. Sit with us. Don't go. Stay a bit, Mary. I'm going, 'bye. - I'm going to call her. - What?. - I'm going to call Bara. - Fingers crossed. You're a good influence on that boy. The boy badly needs a dad like you. Drink, guys, drink. A shot. What's up?. She's in Germany with your mate. I'm supposed to say hi to you. Give me one, too. One more. I'm going after her. Where's that shit live?. Go home. And please take care, OK?. This is nuts. - Are you OK?. - I'll batterthat shit... You fool! Hey, are you OK?. - Where's that shit live?. - Doesn't matter. - Where?. - Far away. Leave it. - Where?. - Let it go. What are you doing?. OK?. - Where's he live?. - In Halle! - What kind of hall?. - Forget about it. - Here's a clean towel. - Thanks. You can wearthis. Sit down. I came to apologize. For what happened. Go away. Go. Can you forgive me, please?. Fuck off! You hear?. Defend yourself! What's going on?. Leave him alone. What happened?. - I raped him. - What do you mean, raped?. Can you forgive me, please?. Get out of here! What happened?. - What happened?. - I don't want to talk about it. What did he do to you?. What did he do to you?. He touched me. How did he touch you?. - How did he touch you?. - On my dick. Hi. Sorry it's so sudden, but you know, time is short. I found you a place. Not as cheap, but closer to school. Your things are already there, just have a last check. Leave that alone. Over here. Can you explain why you left school today?. I'm sorry. I'm not feeling well. Can I have a few days off?. - Have you been to the doctor?. - No. Do me a favour and visit the doctor. - Dear God! What are you doing?. - What's up, honey?. - Why did you hire this idiot?. - He told me to do this. I don't understand what's wrong here?. Everything. I made it clear that the tiles be left alone. So make up your minds what I should be doing. We agreed that the tiles wouldn't be touched. Come on, girls! Get up. Wake up. Wake up, you shit! Is this all you know how to do, you cowardly shit?. Try again. Good... Come on. Don't sleep. Come on. - What's he doing here?. - He tried to kill himself. I want him out of here! Can you help me with him?. Go! Get out of here, faggot! Leave him alone! He can't defend himself. Have you forgotten what he did to me?. - You want to let him die?. - Yes. I'd like to see that fucking faggot dead. - Where are you going?. - Leaving. Dinner's at 8. Come on. Stand up. Ciao. What are you doing here?. - I want to talk to Bara. - But Bara's not here. What's up, man?. Get her. Come in and check if she's here or not. Come on. You can look wherever you want. There's the bathroom... Bara! There's the bedroom. Be my guest. - Where is she then?. - She went back home to Prague. I don't believe you. Look, if you think I slept with her you're wrong, OK?. I'm a fag, get it?. Are you hungry?. - No, I'm not. - Wait. Wait! Have some food. I'll take you to the station then. You can go to her. OK?. Problem?. Here. Wait. - Take it. - Thanks. Give my regards to home. Ciao. - Wait for me at the car?. - Sure. Hi. What are you doing here?. Can I crash at your place for a couple of days?. It's impossible. Just a few days. I want to find a job. Why?. I want to be with you. Go home, Lada. You don't belong here. I can't be without you. Go back home. Please. You think this rock will lighten your load?. Bara called. Lada went to see her. Where is he?. I don't know. Why didn't you tell me you preferred guys?. I was... afraid. Afraid?. Of what?. That I would lose both of you. This is a functional group of prime halogen-derivates. I'll write down the shorthand. CH2X. That's the group. The entire prime halogen-derivate is RCH2X. That means this carbon bears one radical, one halogen and you can ration the amount of hydrogen... Hello. Excuse me, may I speak with Bara Panek?. Please. - Do you know where Lada is?. - He didn't go home yet?. - No. - Why are you looking for him?. - What's going on?. - So... Goodbye. Mum, can I move back home?. Can you please explain what's going on?. I can't teach anymore. I don't get it. I don't get you. Lada! Any news?. The world's a big place. And what about you?. I'm going back to Prague. I'll find work... All right. Come in. - Good morning. - Colleague, come on in. So what have you decided?. - Can I stay?. - Of course. Such an excellent teacher is an asset to the school. - Good morning. - You can start immediately. - Hi, Peter. - Hi. I must ask, it won't bother you that I'm a homosexual?. Well, today it's... an officially recognized thing. Isn't it?. Yes. We recognize the snail because it looks like a snail. But look at these shells. They all look alike, but if you look closer you'll see each is different. Nature produces only originals. We, too, are each different. Diversity is sometimes a trap and sometimes a gift. It depends what we do with it. Imagine how awful it would be if we were all the same. Imagine if we were all like me. Or like Spejla here. - Or like Strouhal! - Or like Soucek! Or like our principal. So I guess I should leave again. Wait. Lada. I'm happy you're home. - What happened to you?. - He's living here?. Yes. Are you fucking each other or not?. - So you're into girls too?. - Don't worry. I'm leaving. Please, come in. Are you hungry?. - What's going on between you?. - Nothing. So what's he doing here?. Everybody needs somebody. And you've got me. I want you to know that. Mary, she's started giving birth. Lada... please... Forgive him. Please. You have to forgive him. Otherwise this bad feeling will eat us up forever. Do you know what I mean?. Lada. Please. - Wait. - Grab it, OK?. Good girl. Pull! Now. Let's do it. Good, good... Almost there! Come here. Little one, you're so cute.
