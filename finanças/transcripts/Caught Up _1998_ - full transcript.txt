Captioning made possible by lions gate entertainment yo, peep this. The story i'm going to tell you is wild. Some of it's real serious. Some of it's real funny. But it's all the truth. So go ahead and laugh and go ahead and cry. But listen up. I'd been out of jail two months, and i wasn't getting any sleep. That's 'cause i was thinking all the time. My mind wouldn't rest. I was smokin' indo, waiting for my boy trip to drop by the crib. Trip used to work for me. But he went solo while i was inside. As usual, trip and his fucked-out afro were late as hell. God damn it do i look like a deaf nigga to you? Hey, yo, daryl, she ain't around is she? Hell, no. I never tell you to come by when she's here. Cool. 'Sup, man? Cool. Yo, man, how come your mom hates me so much? 'Cause you's a no-good, dope dealer exploiting his own people. So what? Your ass is one, too. That's past tense, nigga. I got me some other plans now. What you saying? You ain't going back into the gang? That's bullshit. You just got jail hang-over, nigga. That's all. You're goddamn right. I never thought those stupid-ass cops would ever catch my ass. I damn near went crazy in that motherfucking cage. It ain't that bad, man. Shit, that was your first big. I been up in that motherfucker four times. That's 'cause you're crazy. Just like the rest of them. Half of those motherfuckers like being locked up. I ain't built for that shit. So what you gonna do? I'm going into business. Opening up a club. A club? What you mean a club? A club, you ignorant motherfucker. A dark place with liquor, freaks, music, dancing. C-l-u-b. You know i throw the livest sets in the hood. And there's this warehouse on 133rd that's perfect. Yeah, that could be cool. Niggas do like to get their groove on. Can i get in free? Hell no. Charging niggas like you extra because you make me hire more security. So when you going to open this shit up? Soon as i raise the money. Right, right. Well, how much you need? About 25 grand. You got that much grip? I got 15 grand, so i need 10 more. What i need you to do is ask around, see if anybody wants to invest. You tell whoever puts up the duck i give 20 % of the profits. How come you don't just ask me for it? You got $10,000, trip? What you think, i just blow all my dough? You think i'm stupid? Huh? Go ahead, motherfucker! I got it up in the bank. Let's race. The bank. I'm offering you money, nigga. You going to sit there or what? Yo, damn, yo, ow! Ha ha! Hey, trip. You need to calm down and put your seatbelt on, man. You're dangerous. Well, check this out. Your name martini? No. You ain't my goddamn mother either! Ha ha ha! There's a cool space. Pull up here. * Everybody, hands up * az and jd, whole club getting' crunk * * the trace is on me * on the dance floor you got your money up in there? Yeah. I'll be right back. All right, man. Partner. Give me that. All right. What's happening, brother? It's all good. All right. Man, was i tired. Tired from stress. And tired of living like an animal in the fucking jungle. I started to nod off. Dreaming about my girlfriend trish. She was all that. A bag of chips and a free soda. She was smart and down. And she waited for a nigga while i was in jail. Plus, baby was fine as all hell, too. A few days back, she told me she was pregnant. At first i was pissed. But then i started hopin' for a hard-headed little boy. I knew if i was going to be a father, i had to get my life straight. Hmm? Ohh. Uhh! Drive, nigga. I got the money. You crazy-ass motherfucker! What the fuck are you doing? Have you lost your fucking mind? You said you needed money, didn't you? I got it! Oh, shit. My shoulder's fucked up. You didn't say nothing about robbing no fuckin' bank! I ain't gotta tell you everything i want to do. What the fuck? Motherfucker! Oh, shit! We got to bail! We got to bail! Son of a bitch. Fuck! 20, 40, 60. Trying to help a nigga out, and he don't even appreciate it. You stupid motherfucker! What's your problem, punk? Don't shoot at the fuckin' cops! You're going to get us both killed. Oh, shit. Shit! Don't do that. Don't do that, man. Don't you fuckin' move. That was almost five years ago. I don't know if i'll ever stop having nightmares about that day. I sure wish trip had survived the crash though. That way, i could've killed the stupid motherfucker. You want to know what those five years were like? Hell. The fire burning me up 24/7. I started thinking about death all the time, maybe killing myself. Then i found a better way to escape. The books took me outside the walls, outside me. This greek philosopher went by the handle epictetus. He said only the educated are free. Prison is crowded as hell. I got early parole. I dreamed of this moment for five years. My beautiful woman and my young son waiting to take me home. But that wasn't happening. Trish got married while i was in and moved away. Nobody was waiting for me but a dude named destiny. So i walked off to meet him. You're late! You knocked, which means you can read. Congratulations. Sit down. Daryl allen. Recent graduate of the university of san quentin. My grandmother told me never to trust a man with two first names. Was she right? Nope. She wasn't talking about me. Then how come you've spent most of your voting age years behind bars? There wasn't anybody that i wanted to vote for. Very funny. This isn't your first dance, but i got to read you the rules anyway. You're to report to me as often as i say. You don't leave the county, you don't carry a gun, a knife, weapon of any kind. You don't consort or associate with known felons. No use of illegal drugs are going to be tolerated. Now, you break these rules, or any others that i decide to make up, you're going to be sent back to the university of san quentin to work on your graduate degree. You understand? Are we finished? Where are you staying? The foxy lady over on la cienega. The last time you were out you stayed with your mother. What happened? She got tired of you fucking up? No, sir. She died. Two years ago. You probably worried her to death. You know, daryl, i look at this rap sheet and i see... a felony conviction for possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute. That's strike one. And then there's the bank robbery conviction. The subject of our current association. Strike two! Now life is harder than baseball, daryl. You don't come to bat but once. You get that third strike, then you're heading back to the dug-out for 25 years to life. I looked everywhere for a job. Everywhere. Did you ever see a want ad for a bald ex-con with big ears? I didn't think so. For a second i thought it was her. But it wasn't. This girl had a totally different vibe about her. I figured it was time to see just how rusty my rap was. Would you please stop staring at me? What's your name? My first name is go away and my last name is leave me alone. Hi, i'm daryl, miss leave me alone. I want to show you something. I don't recall offering you a seat. Her name is trish harland. You favor each other so much you've got to be related or something. I don't have any family that i know of. You just got out of prison, didn't you? Say what? Is it that damn obvious? Actually, yes. And besides, i'm sort of gifted. I can read a certain type of person's mind. Is that right? Mm-hmm. And what type of person is that? Men. Don't trip. I used to tell fortunes for a living. You learn to be sensitive, spot for clues. And by the way, my real name is vanessa. How ya doing, vanessa? It's nice to meet you. So are you one of them psychics on them tv hotlines that be ganking folks? Something like that. But i never ganked anybody. Ok. If you're a mind reader, tell me what i'm thinking right now. You love my lips. You'd like me to wrap them around you. God damn. Wow, dionne warwick like a motherfucker. How do you do that? Like i said, it's just the tricks of my trade. And anyway, a man had been locked up, usually they have sex on the brain. So, you haven't had much luck on the job market, huh? Nobody wants to hire an ex-convict. What were you serving time for? Making a large withdrawal without my instant teller card. They're getting a little picky about that lately. What type of work have you done in the past? I was a salesman. I done a gang of marketing to the public. I'm sure you have. You seem like a real customer service expert. Satisfaction guaranteed. Or your money back. So, what are you into... jewels, huh? Mm-hmm. They say diamonds are a girl's best friend, so i thought i'd get to know them better. I think that's bullshit. A good man is a girl's best friend. You always let convicts walk you to your car? I'm a psychic, remember? I know who's ok and who's not. Well, here's my car. Well, listen... i could use a good psychic to help me predict my future, so why don't you give me your telephone number. Look, daryl, you're really cute and i've had a lot of fun talking with you, but i'm working on my future now. Well, instead of trying to read my mind, why don't you look inside my heart. Oh, shit! Ohh! Oh, god, what's happening? We're getting jacked! Come on! Come on! Come over here, come over here! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! This motherfucker's crazy! Come on, come on, come on, come on! Come on, come on! Oh, shit! Shit! Don't leave me! Shh! Shut up! I ain't gonna leave you. Wait a second. He's coming. Here's a gun. Thanks for not waiting till after we got killed. Does this thing shoot straight? I don't know. I've never used it. Don't move. Aah! You better leave us the fuck alone before you get fucked up! Aah! Fuck it. I ain't going out like no punk. Aah! Nice cell you have here, daryl. Decorate it yourself? Well, i guess you get used to things being a certain kind of way. You don't mind if i stay a while, do you? You stay as long as you want. I ain't got no appointments. Go on, this indo's really smooth. No thanks. I make bad decisions while i'm high. Let me ask you something. You got any beefs that would make somebody want to put a hit out on you? Of course not. Maybe i should be asking you the same thing. No, all my accounts are settled. Or closed. Why are you carrying this gat around in your purse? A friend gave it to me for protection. It's registered. A weak-ass chrome ain't good for nothing. I knew a guy who got shot five times with a fuckin' .22. He chased down the motherfucker that shot him, stabbed him 30 times with a butcher knife, then drove himself to the emergency room in the fool's hoopty. Would you please stop talking about people getting killed? I'm sorry. Ohh. Daryl? Do you believe in fate? The dictates of the heart are the voices of fate. I am the master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul. You poetic bank robber. That's what i call flavor. I believe us meeting is fate. I didn't see it at first. Well, almost getting your cap pilled has a way of changing your perspective. You haven't been with a woman in a while, huh? Don't worry. There are some things you never forget. Ahh. Uhh! Ahh! Ohh! Uhh. I ain't trying to front or nothing, but considering it had been 5 years, i handled my business damn well that night. Hey, it's the big, bad wolf... come looking for my little red riding hood. How ya, daryl? My name's billy grimm, but my friends call me wild bill. Aren't you gonna say something? Huh? In the movies guys always have some witty wisecrack when someone sticks a gun at their head. Uh, uh, an inventive insight, a clever comeback. A pithy parable. But alas in real life people aren't that quick, are they? They just shut the fuck up and they wonder whether or not they're going to die. Who the fuck are you, man? I'm a special friend of your friend vanessa's. And, hmm. I have a very unique sense of humor. You see? There's no clip in the pistol. Ha ha ha! Uh! Uhh! Son of a bitch! Ha ha ha! Hold it right there, partner. You're gonna have to wait till i get some feeling back in my jaw before you hit me again. Damn it, billy. I told you to wait for me outside. How'd you get in here? Asked the clerk for the key. I am so sorry, baby. I called billy because i wanted him to meet you. Yes. Vanessa says you need a job. And i'm in the market for drivers. I was just testing to see if you have a cool head. Because you see, i'm sleek fleet limos. So, let me know if you want to join my team. You stick a gun at my grill?! And now you're offering me a gig? Starting pay is 750 a week plus tips. Hey, i got your big tip hanging right here. Daryl. Daryl. Daryl, stop it. Don't be hasty. Who else is offering you a job? Look, does he want the goddamn job or not? You shut the fuck up?! Please, leave us alone for a moment. Ohh. You better check that fool and get him out of my face before i strangle his ass. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And you can forget about me working for him, too. Ok? Ok. Ok?! Ok. Oh, daryl, you have made a wise decision in taking vanessa's advice. She's a very special woman. She's never steered me wrong yet. Yo! Ha ha. Billy, my man. Yo, my nigga, what's up, homey? What's happening? So this must be the new guy. Daryl, herbert. Herbert, daryl. Assign him a car and give him a schedule. All right, baby. Hey, welcome aboard, young brother. Look here, you an ex-con? Oh, yeah. Motherfuckers ain't been letting me forget about that shit either. Hey, i did a dime in marion myself for killing a cop. You killed a cop? And you only got a dime? He was a crooked cop. Stabbed me in the eye with an ice pick while i was strangling his ass. But i watched that bitch die with my good eye though. Come on, man. Go, come on. Man, you're taking all day, man. So does billy always hire dudes fresh off the joint? Hell, yeah. He knows we can't afford to fuck up. Sucker loves that control, man. You don't much like his ass, do you? Hey, come on now, young blood. Shit, man. Billy's given me a chance to turn my life around. Let me make up for the mistakes of my past, my brother. I hates that dick-eating motherfucker. The job was real simple. I picked people up all over the city... this was the first regular gig i ever had. A lot of the passengers didn't seem too legit. But who is in l.a.? I just did what i was paid for, which was driving. I didn't know nothing about any of these fools' business, and i didn't want to know. I was putting money away. Planning for the day i'd be able to step up to my son, tell him that i'm his father, and have him be proud of me. I asked vanessa to read my fortune. At first she refused. But i wouldn't take no for an answer. Ok. Cut the cards into three piles. All right. What am i supposed to do now? Concentrate. The tarot feeds off of your energy. I only function as the interpreter. This first card represents you, daryl. The fool? Why i gotta be the fool? Don't take the cards literally. This is just your symbol. Well, then why can't i be the player or some shit like that? This next card tells us what your situation is. The wheel of fortune. You're at a major turning point in your life. This next card tells you what will hinder you on your journey. The six of pentacles. You lack resources, knowledge, and power. Tell me some shit i don't already know. This next card reveals your past. The three of swords. Heartbreak, isolation, desertion. Damn. On target like a motherfucker that time. This next card tells the source of all of your problems. Hell, yeah. I've been battling devils all my life. Now, the next two cards reveal alternate possibilities for your future. The tower. Signs of sudden crisis and chaos, followed by revelation. I don't like that card. It looks like a prison. Turn over the next card and give me something better. I ain't fucking with that shit no more! Daryl. Where's my fucking coat? I told you not to take the cards literally. They have many meanings. This is the only card i want you to think about. Everything's going to be fine, baby. I love you, daryl. What are your dreams, daryl? I'm saving up to open a big club, a classy place, fly music. Big video screens. You probably think that's kind of silly, huh? No. You are a strong black man who's been through hell and been able to keep your pride and your character intact. You can do anything you wanna do. Vanessa suggested that we go check out my competition, so we peeped out this spot called the paradise. It was all right. I suddenly got the feeling i was being watched. I figured i must be paranoid. I found out pretty quick that the dances had changed since i went to prison. My club's going to be much better. And i'll be right by your side. Look at this ugly piece of shit. Fuck! Aah! Got to get the fuck out of here. Why are we stopping here? All right, god damn it. It's time for your ass to come clean, girl. What the fuck is going on? Why are you asking me like i'm supposed to know? Why? 'Cause i was a hustler for 10 years. And i only got busted on once. Now, all of a sudden, i'm getting chased and shot at like a fucking mark every time i turn around. And guess what? Every time that shit happens i'm with your ass. Now i ain't stupid. And that ain't no motherfucking coincidence. So? I suggest you start breaking it down! I think that it might be a man that i used to be with back east. I moved out here to get away from him. Look, baby, i don't know how he could have found me. Come on. You telling me... that this dude is trying to shoot you for dumping him. He probably sent someone to do it. But that don't make no motherfucking sense! You don't know ahmad. He is very psychotic... and very dangerous. I don't give a fuck if he's the terminator's daddy. Niggas who trip over women terrorize their asses in person. They don't send somebody else to do that shit. I knew niggas in the joint that killed their women. They all did that shit up close and personal, usually by hand. Now give me the real scoop, girl! I am giving you the real scoop, daryl. But you're not telling me everything. Yes, i am. I swear. There's got to be more to this than just a bad case of pussy fever. Ahmad is crazy. He can't stand the idea of me being with anyone else. Ok. If this ahmad character is really that dangerous, then maybe what you need to do is report his ass to the cops. Come on. No. I don't want to do that. I can handle this myself. I don't see you handling shit. We're lucky to be alive right now. I say we go to the cops. And i say this is none of your business. This is my problem and i'll handle it in my way. Look, i'm trying to be down with you right now. But i'm living on the edge of a cliff. I can't afford to get mixed up in no shit where i might have to kill someone. In other words, you're abandoning me. It ain't even like that. You don't want to level with me, you won't go to the cops. You want to handle this shit your own way, cool. That means i might have to step off... at least until you get your shit straight. Whoa. You're a little jumpy there, aren't you, daryl? What the fuck are you doing here? I'm everywhere. So how's it going? It's going good. I just finished speaking with your boss. You mean billy? You talked to him? Standard procedure. I told you i was going to be checking you out. He said that you're doing a great job. I'm glad to hear it. Congratulations. Ok. Ok. Yo, larry. What you doing on the boards, man? Where's herbert? Billy finally got smart, fired his ass. I'm the scheduler now. You know what? You got some real serious ass stank breath, you know that, brother? Oh, man, why you got to go there? I can't help this halitosis thing. It's a genetic condition. I don't see no women flocking around you either! Brother! There he is! Hey! What's up there, boy? Ha ha ha ha ha! Hey, what's happening, baby? Ha ha! Damn it, nigga. I thought i'd never see your ass again. Shit. As much as you me been hanging, you know goddamn well i wouldn't do you like that. Look here. Do you feel like having a drink with an old man? I'm over! Ha ha ha! Shit. You ain't said nothing about bad luck, young boy. Shit. I got up to a fucked up start when my mama named me herbert. Herbert! Now what kind of name is that for a nigga? Ha ha ha! Man, you should have become a muslim when you was in the joint that way you could have changed your name. Uh... uh-uh. I can't do it. I love me some pork ribs. And i ate one of them moon pie one time, boy, gave me some fierce gas. Like to blow a hole in my ass! Ha ha ha ha! Well, i guess you got to live with herbert then. I tell you what i got to do. I got to find me another job. My old lady about to kick my ass out the house. I'm sorry you lost your job, man. That nigga billy is a punk. Fuck it. I needed to leave that place anyway, before i end up back in the joint. Back in the joint? What you talking about? Come on. You mean to tell me you ain't noticed nothing funny going on in there? I thought you had your eyes open wider than that, brother. I keep my eyes on the road. That way i don't crash. Vanessa, if this is you, i told you not to call me till you got something real to tell me. Ha ha ha. No, daryl. It's not vanessa. It's billy. I'm glad you're there. Everybody else has fucking disappeared on me. Yeah? What? I need you to do a special pick-up for me. I know you already worked your shift, but there's a very nice bonus in this for you. Yeah, whatever. Just give me the address. Sit tight. I'll send cool kitty cat by to get you. Ok? Thank you. Asshole. Fuckin' weirdo. And there i was, laying at the crib, 10 inches deep in some of the finest motherfuckin' pussy in the hood, and i get a call to pick up your bitch ass. 10 inches? You sure you ain't exaggerating there a little bit, cool cat? Exaggerating? Nigga, my shit is certified by the government. U.s.d.a. that's united states dick association, fool. As a matter of fact, we're here, nigga. Get your ass out. Deliver the car to the address, nigga. God damn it. Come on, come on, come on! Where's the fucking nuts? What seems to be the problem here? Uh... i had a blow out, officer. I was just changing the tire. Is this your car? No, sir. I'm the driver. I was just delivering it for a client. It's dangerous to leave your trunk open. I had two choices-- try to fuck up this cop and take his gun... or try to convince the d.a. i didn't know there was a dead dude in the trunk. A guaranteed third strike. Fuck that. It was on. You should get yourself some road flares. Have a good night. Jesus! Who the fuck is trying to break down my door?! I'm working. Oh! Oh! Ah! Oh, oh! What's the matter? Did you have a hard night last night? If you ever come near me, call me, or even speak my name again, i will kill you. Mm-hmm. Uhh! Ohh! By the way, i quit. Daryl allen! Ohh! Behind your back! Wait a minute. I didn't do jack. What are y'all arresting me for? Surprise, daryl. Ah! Ha ha ha ha! Close your mouth before some jailhouse faggot sticks a dick in it. My name is not herbert. Detective frank lewden. My friends call me frank. You can call me detective lewden. Now, i guess you think what i did was fucked up-- pretending to be your buddy, kicking it with you at your crib, talking about life and pussy with you. Now you feel betrayed. Let's get one thing straight, darryl. I don't give a fuck how you feel, so let's skip the bullshit and get down to the question. What question? You punk-ass nigga. Let me give you a little background information, daryl. See, i been undercover at sleek fleet for the past two months, and the only thing sleek about the fleet is his clientele. Drug carriers, bag men, hookers, fences, bookies, any and every body looking to move illegal goods, money, and/or pussy around. Now, billy used to be a heroin dealer, but the gang got too rough for his little punk ass, so billy being the enterprising little miscreant that he is, came up with a new idea. Providing transportation at outrageous prices for all the lowlifes coming to town to do their dirty work. Now, me, personally, i think this shit is a rip-off, but with great marketing and a paranoid customer base, that shit will get you over every time. What you got me down here for? You don't need me to bust him. See, i'm not trying to shut down billy's little chicken shit operation. I just want to co-op it, go after the heavy hitters. Now you made a lot of money at the sleek fleet, daryl, and out of the blue you just up and quit. Why? Tell me what you saw that made you so afraid you quit, huh? I wasn't scared of nothing, just got tired of driving, is all. Do i look stupid to you, motherfucker, or you just got bad eyes, boy? I wish i did have bad eyes, 'cause then i wouldn't have to look at your ugly motherfuckin' face! Wow. You got me pretty good there, boy. Listen to me! You going back on that job on monday. This time you working for me, you understand? You gonna do it, or else i'm gonna kill you, nigga! Come on in, daryl! Door's open. We gotta talk! Ow, daryl, you're hurting me. You need a drink. I don't want nothing to fucking drink! I want you to tell me what the fuck you got me mixed up in. I will tell you everything you need to know when you sit down, chill out, and have a drink with me. All right, vanessa... i ain't playing with your ass no more! Start talking. I met billy when i first moved to town. I was working as a psychic from a store front in venice. Billy was a regular, he loaned me money, said he wanted to be my best friend. Somewhere along the way he heard about ahmad, who had put the word out that he was looking for me, but billy kept quiet, he said he wanted me to use my gift so i could help him check people out. Why did you hook me up with his nefarious ass? No one's ever got busted working for billy before, i swear, i only wanted to help you. Yeah, ya helped me all right, right up to my eyes in shit! Now, what's the real reason that this ahmad character is trying to kill you? Ahmad gave this to me. When i left, it's the only thing i had to show for two good years of my life, so i didn't give it back. That is one hell of a piece of ice. How much is it worth? My life. I want you to hold on to it for me. So i can get smoked over it? No thanks! My name is bennett and i ain't in it. I'm out of here. I'm sorry i lied to you, but i was afraid! Can you please trust me again? You want the truth? Hell, no! I know i blew it, but i never had a man i could trust before. I didn't know how to act. I'll make sure you're with me, baby. I need you so much, just once more, no one's ever made me feel the way you do, nobody. How much did you say that diamond was worth? Over a half million dollars. This is gonna be so good. I feel real freaky! Ohh! What the fuck?! What the fuck?! Aah! God. What the fuck? Oh, shit. Miss dietrich! This is the police! Open the door! Miss dietrich! Oh! Bro, you got a dollar? And the question angelinos are asking themselves tonight is simply this, where is daryl allen? The alleged perpetrator of a vicious beating, knife murder, that took place in this building right behind me. Wait a second. They're bringing the body through. Ah, i think you might want to move--remove children away from the television set. This isn't a pretty sight. The alleged perpetrator daryl allen, 27... do you believe in reincarnation? I do. You know why? 'Cause the only reason i can think of for god to fuck with one person as much as he has me, is if i did some really messed up shit in a past life. I had to find out who really killed vanessa if i didn't want to burn for it. But first, i needed to go back to the hood and get strapped. Yo, what's up, man? Look at these soft-ass niggas. I could recruit a crew, run up on these fools, and get the... damn! Stop that bullshit, nigga! See, that's why i keep my ass from down here. The thrill of the game never leaves your blood. You gotta remove yourself from temptation. So it's time to accept the fact that life prohibition, the so-called war on drugs, is a total and absolute failure, and who are the causalities of this war? Our children incarcerated by the millions, without adequate access... this motherfucker really pisses me off! Who's that, strap? This dude on the tv? Yeah, this punk-ass mayor scrotum nigga. Liquor and cigarettes are best controlled by... daryl, i thought yo' ass was still up in the penitentiary? Anyway, this mayor scrotum nigga talking about legalizing drugs! Saying put all the police and jail money into treatment and prevention. Can you believe that ill shit? Do you know what that's going to do to the prices? It's gonna put a lot of niggas out of business. Hell, yeah! This mean no more fights over territory, which gonna cut my business down about 90 %! These damn politicians always trying to fuck up the economy! What's up, g? What you need? You need some tools to spread a little love? Am i right? I got what ya need, g, don't worry about nothing. I got these .22s, .38s, .45s. I got glocks, i got these-- look, i got these tex, uzis, aks, huh? How about this sawed off? How about this super nigga bulletproof vest, to relieve your stress? I was just planning on getting me a nina, man. What, just one? Oh, ok. Take your time man, look around. Why did vanessa have to get killed? I was supposed to take her. I'm the big bad wolf! I'm the master of mayhem! Yo, big bad wolf! Guess what? Little red riding hood is strapped! Oh, christ, daryl, what are you doing here? I came to learn how to be a lethal enforcer. Start the game up again, i wanna play. I guess i won that round! Now who do you think that i should shoot next? Why did you kill vanessa? Hey! I didn't kill anybody, fool! I hate to argue with you, seeing as you're the one holding the gun! But your prints were found all over the place. If you didn't kill her, then who did? That's what i came to ask you. Now stop crying like a little bitch and tell me about this ahmad dude. Daryl, i would certainly like to help you except for one little problem. I don't know what the fuck it is you're talking about! Now! See! You picked the wrong night to talk shit! 'Cause tonight i'm a nigga with nothing to lose! And that's a very dangerous type of nigga to fuck with! Absolutely. So, i suggest you check your memory banks! Ooh. Well, that must be bebe! You remember my buddy, don't you? He's 300 pounds of pure muscle with a mean sadistic streak. He'll be happy to show you out. Brother. We ain't finished here! You better get rid of him fast, because if you don't, i'm gonna start blasting. I promise you, even if bebe gets me, i'm gonna smoke your ass first! Oh, bebe! Bebe, i have a job for you! Uh! You must be billy, right? Sorry for the unannounced intrusion, but your big guard boy was very rude! Who the fuck are you guys? My name is ahmad! You don't know me, but i hear plenty about you, billy! I come for some information that you might be able to share with me. What is with all the fucking questions today? Did i wake up looking like some goddamn encyclopedia or something? You don't look like no damn book to me. You look like a fast bat boy! What the fuck did you just say? Did you just call me a fag? You dreadlock wearing son of a bitch! Ohh! You know me mother? I don't appreciate rude talk about me mother! Do it again, i'm gonna deck you! Ahh. Get him up! You're not on some fucking island. You're out in the valley, all right? I got friends out here in the valley. Fuckin' cocksuckers. A good samaritan send this story to me. A woman i used to be associated get dead. Now, i don't mind that because she's a bad sort of woman, but she had some property that belonged to me-- you see a man named daryl allen deadar. Me know that he got my property, so they and bob and me, we come to this city of fallen angels to find this man. We here say, who the dead wicked woman, and this daryl allen, work for who? Billy! The cowboy! You! So, billy, where is this daryl allen? Well, i think i can help you with that... but first i would like to know what it is he has of yours, and what's in it for me to turn him over. Fair enough. I hear you have a reputation for being discreet. So, i'm gonna share a tale with you-- a vast fixation unfold fuckery! A brilliant and handsome appropriate was taking a holiday in miami, when he meets this beautiful siren... so pristine he can feel the burning flames of love just looking at she. He investigates! Finds out she has a gift, reading man's thoughts, things only god and him should know, so the man seizes upon this woman, thinking all the time, how is going to utilize her talents to enrich himself and his brothers. Now this pandula was a supreme grinds master, a master of taming any feline. But he had never pleased his massive tool in a poom poom like this before. The sweet agony. Addictive. Now soon after, he reads a notice in the paper, auction, major diamonds in miami, 20 exelcia diamonds, 20 flawless, brilliant, colorless stones to be auctioned starting at half- million dollars each! He send vanessa in, for job interview at the diamond exchange knowing she can get close to the head man, and everything else they need, she can get. No problem. The security codes, to deaden the alarm system. Done! The 7 vaults, which one the diamonds going to rotate through, done, and yeah, the combination to the vault. Done! They plucked the sacred forbidden fruit like adam in the garden of eden. But while in this state of revelry, the appropriator was bitten by the serpentine judas, blood clot, wicked red eye bumble craven. Spiteful! Wicked! Betrayer! But jano, he did love she. She tiff the secret hiding place of the diamonds right over his head, and she take off! I have been looking for her ever since. I know she can't easily find a fence for that type of material, so daryl allen kill her for the stones! Bastard. I am willing to give you one diamond for your help to help me find this daryl allen. So, where is he, billy? He's in the closet! Fuck! That--that--that is funny, billy. That is funny, but not now, eh? This is not time for no stupid foolishness. No, he's in the closet! No, really he's in the closet. Ollie, ollie, oxen free, you motherfucker. I share my pain with you? Treat you like a man, and you laugh in my face?! Uh-uh. Mummify him, till he makes some sense. In the closet! Daryl! Get your bald ass out here! You see, me can't stand the rope mon! Hold it! I have a better idea! No! This is very crucial for you, billy. Ya force my hand. There's a million and one ways to get a man to talk! I got this. Ya see this? It got this through the mail order! Sulfuric acid, 98 % concentrate! Oh, billy, you gonna piss, you gonna beg, you gonna cry but you wanna tell the truth! The whole truth, billy, and nothing but the truth, so help ya! Put a proper drop on the top of his head! Bob? How much acid you put on the man's head? But we did what ya said to do! You said give the mon a proper dropper. A dropper? I said a proper drop! This is a waste! Dead mon don't talk! Look, you burned through the mon's head! You can see his brain. We have to find this daryl allen! So let's just get your black ass and leave. Hold it! What the fuck now? Bob! Yeah. Go check the closet! Go check the closet, mon! Oh, mon. Come on. Now can ya see? It's empty! Ya see, yo? You don't say nothin' to me, all right? What? Uh! I took one of billy's rides, got on the freeway, and hauled ass! I read once that some people are so fond of ill luck that they run half-way to meet it. Maybe that's true, but i felt like luck always came looking for my ass, and it was usually ill as fuck when it found me. Damn! I needed somebody to talk to. I had to make a call i'd sworn not to make till i was ready. Hello? Hello, um... you must be roger, huh? Yeah, who's this? This, uh... daryl. Daryl allen. I heard that name a million times. Was this a bad time to call? Is trish there with you? Put her ass on. What? Hold up, man. I haven't talked to trish in years. I just called to say hello, ya know? Oh. Well, she ain't here. She's gone. Gone? Gone. Out of here, bailed out. How many ways you want me to say it? Something happen to her, or what? This ain't nothing new, man. Last time we got into a fight, she ran off to her girlfriend's crib for 4 days. This time she's been gone over a week. She still hasn't called. She said she was going out and never came back. I'm tired of this shit. Being married's gotta be worse than being in jail. When did you get out anyway? Not too long ago. Listen, sorry you're having problems, man. Yo, is... my s... jerome ain't there, is he? Yeah, he's here. I suppose you wanna speak to him, huh? Yeah, if it's ok? Just for a second. Ok. Hold on. Jerome? I have somebody who wants to talk to you, all right? Hello? Hello, jerome? Hi, this is daryl. I'm a friend of your mom's. How ya doing? Fine. I'm playing football. That's great! Listen, jerome... i know you probably don't remember me, but i knew you when you were a baby. I wanted to tell you... do good in school. Study hard. Listen to your mama. Stay out of trouble. Be a good boy. Will you do that for me? Yes! Good-bye. Bye! I said fuck it. I'd always hoped that one day i could be a part of my son's life, now that dream was dead. And this county had nothing to offer me but a jail cell. My mind started playing tricks on me. Torturing me with bad memories and crazy ideas, and them tarot cards-- all the shit i was running from. Then i thought of my card, the fool. The fool. Maybe that shit about people chasing after ill luck is true, because i was headed back to l.a.! Aw, man, i didn't know it was so far out here! Shut up, and do what i'm paying you for! Whoa, whoa, here it is. Vanessa dietrich. This is the one you're looking for, right? Yeah, that's the one. You really serious about doing this, dude? I'm as serious as a motherfuckin' heart attack... dude! Let's go! Get the fuck out. Ok, dude. Man, this is some twisted shit. Dude, what the fuck are you doing? Noooo! Thinking is as addictive as crack. Once you start, you can't stop. The answers of life are usually right in front of you, waiting for you to open your eyes and take a look. After what i'd seen in the grave, i figured out who had to be mixed up in this mess, and then i stalked him. I guess this must be the night of the living dead. I dug up the body yesterday... vanessa. But how did you know it was trish? You're the mind reader! You tell me! A tattoo? She has your name tattooed there? Why? She didn't want her mama to see it. I don't know how you know the things that you know. Maybe you sold your soul to the devil or something, but you're not as smart as you think. Looks like i'm smarter than you. Bullshit! I figured out that you couldn't do it by yourself, that you needed help! So you go and kidnap my ex... and kill her... and frame me? Someone to help you fence your fuckin' diamonds? I spotted him early, when billy had me check him out. Why did you have to kill trish? She was a good woman. But she abandoned you. Baby. I mean, how is that good? I guess your bad luck rubbed off on her. She had the wrong face at the wrong time. You're not answering my questions. Why did you make it look like i killed you? Because i had to get ahmad and his bros off my tail before they deaded me. I figured while they were out chasing you, i could get rid of the diamonds and get gone. Well, you're gone, all right. Straight to the cops with me. If you give me any shit... i'll smoke you before we even get there. Come on, get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of here! I'm psychic, too! I see jail in your future! Get your lying ass out there! Get the fuck out there! Uh! Sure took you long enough to get him out here. He felt the need for conversation. Needed you, babe. Let's get this ice ready to move! Ohh. Boo boo, you found someone that could handle him. How much is he going to give us? 2 million dollars in clean cold cash. 20 cents on the dollar? Is that the best you could do? Vanessa, do you have any idea how hot these fuckin' rocks are? I think so, frank. I'm the one that took them, remember? It took me months to find somebody who'd even touch this shit. Now, word is already starting to spread that somebody's looking to sell, and pretty soon those island niggas are going figure out we fooled them. When that happens, if we haven't cashed out and booked, somebody is going to end up dead. Just might be you, vanessa. So, do both of us a favor and shut the fuck up, please. Thank you. I'm sorry, you're right. So what do we do now? We sit tight and we wait for a fence named hands. Hands. Is he the fat chinese grifter, with the limp you told me about? No, that's hung lo. Hands is a short spic with the bushy moustache. You mean like that guy there? Cut the fuckin' light! Cut the fuckin' light! You serpa! Make it easy on yourself. Put down the gun, or get shot, no! Don't do anything stupid, rasta. I think you should know i'm a police officer. Police?! Dark! With rotten teeth! Good seeing you, ahmad. I missed you and your magic... snake. And the serpent had seven heads... and all that looked upon it turned to stone! You broke my heart. You broke my heart! Easy, rasta. There's no need for that. Ahmad! Don't kill the chicken before she lay the golden egg, mon! Slow your roll there. The money first. The money first. You thought you could sell the stones without me finding out about it? I have eyes everywhere! Ears everywhere, dopies listening to hear this crackle of ice! Gimme the diamonds. Gimme the diamonds now! Ahh! Your light still shines! So, pretty lady... what do you think i am thinking now? I never stopped loving you, baby. I never stopped loving you. I always thought that... i'd find you some day. I hear what you're thinking. Hello? It's me, mr. Sep. It's daryl allen. Daryl! You really disappointed me, you fooled me, man, but we gonna catch up to you sooner or later. Wait a minute. Ya gotta listen to my side of the story. You go ahead. It's your quarter. And they're all lying in there along with the diamonds. Check it out! But daryl, your story's inconsistent. Inconsistent? What you talking about? Well, you said this all started after the jamaicans had found vanessa, they were trying to kill her? Right. Like i said we go chased and busted on twice. But the rasta said they didn't even know where vanessa was until after they read the story about her being murdered in the newspaper. So daryl, who was that shooting at you, those other two times? Jake was right. The shit still didn't fit together. It was a big piece missing from the puzzle. Fuck! If it wasn't vanessa's enemies who tried to smoke us, then who was it? Oh, you're finally waking up. That's good. That's ok. Take your time. I've waited 7 years for this moment. Oh, shit. Who the fuck are you, man? Who the fuck am i? Who the fuck am i?! I am justice, fuckass! I'm the conscience you never had! I'm the revenger of blood sent to deliver retribution! I'm the grim reaper! I'm a cat playing with a mouse! You sound like a crazy motherfucker. Wrong! I'm not a motherfucker, or a woman fucker, or a man fucker, or any kind of fucker! Because, you see, those titles they require certain tools, that i no longer possess, thanks to you! I lost them a long time ago. I want to show you something, daryl. Daryl! Oh, shit. I knew you were a freak! Turn around! Yo... pull your pants up, man! You ain't got nothing i want to see! If you don't want to die right now, you will look between my legs, and tell me what you see! Fuck! Turn around! Oh, shit, man, what the fuck happened to you? What the fuck happened to me? Ha ha ha! You happened! You and your home boy, that smoked out motherfucker who blew my dick and balls off with a magnum .44! That is what happened! In another better life, i was the security guard in that bank you robbed. Ohh, yeah! I am a man who fortune hath cruelly scratched! Yo, man... i'm sorry about what happened to you, but that shit is not my fault! I didn't know that trip was going to rob that bank! To be or not to be, that is the question. Cut the shakespeare, and listen to me! I'm not the one who shot you! A plague on both your houses! Vanessa thought it was the jamaicans that was after us, those two times we got busted on, but it was you? Ha ha ha! Life is as tedious as a twice told tale. You have no idea the amount of shit that has gone down because of your dickless ass. The fuckin' party stacked up! Trish would still be alive today if it wasn't for you! Eyes, see your last. Fucker, see this! Untimely death! I'm lucky strap's a good salesman. He finally talked me into buying a bulletproof vest, along with the nina. He took 10 % off, too. So, after i got done with the cops, i counted the money. There wasn't no two million in there. It was more like 500 grand, but it was enough for me to get started. So that's it. There ain't no more to tell. Anyway it's time for y'all's shifts to start, so get up off your ass and get to work. Things are ok now, except i can never feel completely happy. I keep seeing trish's face and thinking she died because of me. I'm sorry, trish. I've got my son living with me now. He's the most important thing in my life. I love him. And no matter what else happens, i'm going to be the father to him that i never had.
