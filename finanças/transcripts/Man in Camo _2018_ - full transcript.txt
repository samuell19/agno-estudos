- Hey, come on in. When you were born, it was 25 hours of labor. When they pulled you out, you had the umbilical cord around your neck. - I was born in Boston in 1969. A year later, my parents got married. They were both hippies. They met up in the universities up there. My father later became a lawyer for Richard Nixon and worked for him for the next 30 years. We're all Democrats. That's just how it is in D.C. You work for the Republicans because they have the money. - So the doctors took you away, put you an an incubator so I never held you until three days later. My mother was organizer and draft evasion counselor for SDS, Students for a Democratic Society. - You had these little turtle eyes and you kind of looked at me like who are you? - I'm dyslexic. - We went to New York. We went with this group that specialized in testing dyslexia and developing exercises that would help you progress. They just remembered sitting in this office and they came up with these silly exercises telling you to crawl on the floor and it would be embarrassing to you. Then we'd crawl and I didn't think we had confidence that it was helping in any way. In retrospect, that was not a particularly good idea. Sad business. - Your dyslexia has been one of the most formative factors of your life. Diagnosed at a very young age and the whole way you interact with the world has been through the way your brain processes information. It's cording who you are. - I'm not sure where dyslexia comes from. In fact, nobody really knows. I suppose if I had to guess, it would be from having the umbilical cord wrapped around your neck when you were born and cutting off oxygen. - When you're a kid and you're anything different, you're ostracized, you're picked on, called stupid. People in my school wondering why this seven or eight year old kid was falling asleep in all of his classes and it was mostly because every night I would go home to a screaming match. When my parents finally did get divorced, they decided to stay in the District of Colombia. ♪ Burden child ♪ I'll see when I'll smile 1977 so it was kind of close to the end of the Vietnam War. Every night when my father would come home, he would turn on the nightly news and there would be images of war and death and violence. Asked my mother what did it mean to die. My mother said, people have different beliefs. Some people believe you die and then you go to heaven or hell. Some people believe when you die, you're reincarnated and I looked into her eyes and I was like, well, what do you believe? My mother was everything. This was like the center of knowledge for every kid and my mother said, oh that's it, the end. When you die, it's like a switch going off so it's just a void of blackness. And for me at like that age, I was like, what the hell? I was afraid to go to sleep, I was afraid to go out. I mean, I didn't want to meet this void because I was terrified of it. A seven year old kid really can't comprehend that. After that, I went through this whole period of being afraid to go outside. I would stay home and watch movies so this is right around the same time that Betamax came out. We had one of the early first Betamax decks. I would stay home and watch like three or four movies a night and I did this for maybe two years or something like that until I finally said, I can't take it anymore and instead of hiding from things that might hurt me, I ran head long into it. You are now watching Russian TV. This is no way influenced by the government. - Good morning fellow Russianers. Today in the weather, there will be 60 percent chance of showers. Hell, I can't take anymore, it's hell. - Oh my god. - You okay? - That is a film from when I was 14 in 1984. My background in film is that I started making movies when I was seven years old and never stopped. I never signed up killing myself a lot in these videos. This is shot on Betamax before VHS and this is me playing myself in both roles. I play the two guys. It's upstairs guy versus downstairs guy. Because I'm the only one, I have to keep coming to the camera and turning it off by hand. I knew exactly the timing so I could turn it on, get in the frame in the position and walk towards the camera and turn it off. Not good aiming, a lot of shooting. This is the big finale coming up. Did you have a happy childhood? Did I have a what? - Turn it on, oh. - Film was like a salvation for me. ♪ Once upon a time there was a dream ♪ ♪ Biggest in the world ♪ You know what I mean My grandfather gave me his old Super 8 camera, which was a hand crank and you had the cartridge you had to put into it and you had to get the film developed. The first time I got that film back and projected it on a wall, it was just splashes of light and I was hooked. ♪ Castle by the flame ♪ She said I'll show you something ♪ ♪ Like you've never known before ♪ Then once camcorders came into reality, I started shooting these videos and the videos were one Betamax tape containing three hours of skits and shorts and I would spend probably about six months every day shooting these little videos. In my mind, these were epic movies that I was making. - Hey Bobs, what's happening, man? Hey yeah, it's a really nice day, isn't it. - Yes it is, Bob, yes it is. It's a real nice day, it's just terrific. - Yeah, I raped your girlfriend, you know. - What? Oh my god, no no no. Freeze, asshole. - Wait, wait Bob, wait Bob. I was only joking, Bob. - Doesn't matter, doesn't matter. You're fucked man, you're really fucked. - I was joking, man, I was joke. - I went to a private school for kids with learning disabilities and at a certain point, I outgrew the school. Then I had to be in a special ed class. We're gonna send you to just go look at this public school. I went into audit the class and these were kids that were like severely physically and mentally handicapped and the teacher really didn't teach so much as acted like a nurse, made sure they were eating and using the bathroom and all of those things and the teacher at the end was like, look, you really can't go here. Just go anywhere else but you're not suited for this. My mother basically had tricked me to go to a boarding school in Boston. - I completely deny that. - Every weekend I wanted to go into the city because that's where the punk rock shows were at this place called the Rath. I started dying my hair black and dressing more punk rock and this was a school with a dress code so I had to come back to school and then hide everything. You know, put it under a bandana when I had a mohawk and all of this. Oh. God, I hate morning. Shit. Going to school, god damn. - We put in a lot of hours. I guess that, comes with being a lawyer in D.C. Ethan! - I became very depressed. One night I was with my girlfriend and we had just come from seeing a show, Hayden Hall in Boston and we were walking back to her neighborhood in Brookline. That night I had been drinking a fair amount as I did every time to get the courage to go to these punk rock shows and the car was driving up the street and I ran and I dove in front of the car but I was so drunk instead of going in front of the car I actually landed right in the door and the car stopped. The guy was like opening his door and then I got up and started screaming at him, like, you fucking asshole, why didn't you hit me? I started kicking the door and the driver looked at me like, what the fuck? This kid's totally crazy and drove off. I was 16 years old. After I had an epiphany and you're gonna die so why would I give the satisfaction to the rest of the world by ending my life early? Why wouldn't I just sit here and try to do as much damage and make as much art, put myself out there as much as I can, and after that, it made me more aggressive about pursuing what I wanna do in life. I'm not recommending it to anybody else, but that's what it did for me. - You had blond curly hair, wholesome looking teenager and I went to the airport to meet you and then this creepy looking kid gets off. He's got a Mohawk, chains around his neck, looked like he hadn't had a bath in weeks, and I'm thinking to myself, oh, his poor parents. Can you imagine having that kind of kid? And all of the sudden I hear from behind me, hi mom, and I turned around and that creepy looking kid was you. My first impulse was to take my raincoat and throw it over your head so no one would see you, but you were my son, so I gave you a big hug and said, welcome home. - Film me, I'm gonna have to hurt you. Why, it's your camera? You should be. - I don't wanna be filmed. Really think about it hard. - A lot of the reason I got into punk rock at such an early age was because of my parents' divorce. My mother moved to Georgetown in Washington D.C. which is a neighborhood where there was a lot more alternative stores, there was punk rock kids hanging out. ♪ Can't do something just don't get it ♪ On M Street, there was a record store called Smash and in there, I would go ask the clerk, what do you think is a really good record to get and then I would run home and then play it over and over again. ♪ Dead end's best ♪ Just like the rest Part of helping me learn to become a better writer is I would take the lyrics sheets, 'cause every punk rock record has a lyric sheet and I would hand copy out every word for word onto a cassette tape and make mix tapes that I would then give out to my friends. ♪ Down and everyone here ♪ Trying to do something they just don't get ♪ Prior to punk, everything was what you can't do. If you can't read, you're inferior. Punk rock was that key that said none of that matters. It was like Occam's razor. It leveled the playing field. It was a sign on the door that said there are no boundaries. You can kick this door in, you can walk through this door, you can open other doors. - Fuck you, man, fuck you, fuck your family. ♪ Fuck this town and everyone in it ♪ ♪ Trying to do something and they just don't get it ♪ - Once we became teenagers, it was pretty much us on our own. We didn't really see any adults until later in the evening and just did what we wanted. - My house became the place where everyone hung out and everyone was drinking and having sex and doing whatever and me and my sister basically raised ourselves like feral little animals that we are. This is a day of a normal boy's life driving through the suburban neighborhoods. And this is my brother. - Go away. - One of the very first creative things I did, I started making silk screen shirts. ♪ 20 dollars it's all I got ♪ 20 dollars and it give me a lot ♪ When I went back to Washington D.C., I started printing these shirts. I just wanted people to see it. I wasn't trying to make a profit and I didn't realize I was ripping off the artist who designed the flyer and I didn't realize I was ripping off the band the Bad Brains which was also a D.C. band and I started selling these shirts in Smash. I had put my name Ethan M on the bottom of every shirt. The owner off Smash coming up to me, going like, look, your shirts are really great but you got to do me a favor, kid. Take your name off of that because Daryl from the Bad Brains has been coming in looking for you and he is pissed. I stopped making shirts after that and that's when I noticed the fanzines. We're here with Project Nerd. - See, this guy's got it. Speaking of this guy, this is Ethan joining us for a very special episode of the Nerd Cast. So what is a zine? - You have fan, a fan of something specific, and magazine. Put the two words together, fanzines. Magazines that are independently published, sometimes Xeroxed, but the one thing they're not is polished. I would look at these zines and go like hey, this is all kind of a mess and I think I could do this too and I really got into it. - It's a passion project. Nobody makes money, it's just artists who want people to see their artwork. - How many of you were born before 1988, anybody in here? Okay, this is me in high school. My fanzine developed from a music centered zine to something that was more focused on the arts. ♪ Let's go get lost somewhere ♪ Where only love is in the air ♪ People started recognizing me. It gave me confidence to keep trying to pursue something creative because it was the first time that not only was I able to express myself, but I felt like I was affecting the community at large. - If he was a boss, I would find this very difficult but since we were friends before we did this, we can both call each other on our shit and that's how we talk to each other. - I've never read a single fanzine. I've distributed them at coffee shops everywhere, but I've been in them. I don't think I've ever really read it. - Slightly irritated at the way people sometimes misuse words or they won't use the proper form of a word and so maybe part of the reason that I helped selfishly is because it reduces irritation when I read these stories that I wanna read. - He handed me a zine, and I think that was his way of hitting me and now we're married. Bye! - For me personally, my parents are both workaholics. My father would sit at the office every night 'till about 9 or 10 o'clock at night, so that meant after school I was taken to his office and would be put into a conference room. In that, they would bring me a pad of paper. They would bring me pencils, staplers, you know, stuff in the office and I would make artwork. I would put them into little books. I would go over to the copy machine, I would make copies and make multiples. At age seven, I was technically making zines. I'd bring them into school and on the school bus or whatever I'd give them out to my friends. - Every issue has a different artist on the cover and has their bio on the back. It inspired me to do my own zine. - You're gonna go through the art world and community realizing that every time you try to do something, there is somebody in between you and getting to success. There is going to be art directors, there's gonna be curators. The fanzine side steps all of that, just like your portfolio and then you can leave that anywhere in the world. The good thing about doing a fanzine opposed to doing a blog, accessing people you would never have contact with a lot of times happens through a fanzine. We leave it on the seat of a train, we leave them in banks, we leave them in coffee shops. By leaving it in a random location, somebody who picks that up who knows nobody in your circle is not interjected into what you're doing automatically and that's a really powerful thing. - Every issue of the zine we've got one artist of the issue that we award that title to. It's that person that gets the cover. - I did this cover photo for the zine. That zine sat in front of the right person who then hired me and then it was like a chain effect. It led to me photographing for several magazines. Wow, damn, things just changed right after that. - What's your best zine story? - There was Faction Five and Maximum Rock and Roll and all of these zines that used to review zines and I would put free for prisoners so I would mail it. I'd have to from the publisher's meet because that's the only way a lot of the zines would get into the prison system would get letters from prisoners all over the world. I started receiving letters from a gentleman named John Wayne Gacy, notably known as a serial killer who killed I think 32 people, buried them under his house. My roommates at that point were like, hey, do you mind never putting our address on the zine because we have serial killers writing you letters. ♪ I would blame you so much more ♪ I've hand stapled, I don't know, 100,000 zines. I've gone through staplers, like had to buy new ones 'cause I've worn them out. I got into writing, I got into doing art, I got into everything flowed from doing these fanzines because if you feel like you are lonely and isolated, it's a great way to bring you out of that and connect with others. The fanzine helped out a lot of people but for me personally, I think it took me as far as I could go. I'll always make the fanzine, but at a certain point, I wanted to do something bigger. I wanna reach a large number of people and affect change in a greater sense. At this point, I was willing to try everything and anything. For the man in the family. - See, so apply old fart for that man in your family. - Got a call in the middle of the night from you and you were in a panic. You told me you had just attacked somebody with a machete. - We had a show in Rhode Island and I had a pin on my shirt. I was very excited about the show. I jumped on Ethan's back and accidentally stabbed him with my pin which must have been pretty painful. Next thing I know, I'm kind of just being suspended off the ground in a choke hold from Ethan and he's, don't ever stab me again, what the. After like two seconds, he realized that I didn't mean to do it and he was the look of sheer fear of my own life and he let me go. - My first question was, well, were they dead or alive and you said alive. Said, okay good. And then you described that you were having a party and there was a, I guess a drunk football player from Colombia who was being very obnoxious and so you threw him out. He came back with buddies and at that point, you took out the old machete that I gave you when you were 10. - Basically mugged him. Went to get his wallet but couldn't get it back easily so ended up just taking the kids pants off completely and then took the wallet and told the kid that when he came back with the money that he owed us, he could have his wallet back. But he was too humiliated to ever come back in the bar. - Chopped his arm, not off, but cut him up. Bleeding, he fled. You called me as not your mother, as your lawyer and asked what you should do. I said, okay, if he's alive, call the police. Report a home invasion and when the police come, explain what happened. Whoever gets to the police first, the police is gonna believe. - One day, two detectives came to the door looking for him. Apparently he busted some kids tooth. They went to the bar and arrested him. - Do I think you're a tough guy? No, you're a marshmallow. - Later on, you called me back, and I said, well, how'd it go? And you said, they wrote it down as a home invasion and then you said as a young cop was leaving he turned around and he said, did you get him good? And he said, yeah. - I was two blocks away when Ronald Reagan got shot. I was three blocks away when a guy tried to blow up the Washington monument. I lived in this world where I always thought at any moment I could get blown up or killed by some nut bag or some foreign power. I got into a lot of violence. Got in fights, got arrested. I had a reputation as being someone who was violent and in the high schools and I remember there were a lot of people who were afraid of me. But I came to this realization that all of that posturing was related to this fear, this deep seated fear of getting physically hurt or dying and then I started looking at all of these other tough guys around and I started realizing that wait a minute, all these guys that are really tough are actually completely terrified. I know they're just like me. They're frightened little boys who were afraid of the big black void. Ethan. - Hey bud. Is it on? Turn it off 'cause we're gonna get a fire extinguisher. Okay, say your last words. Look, there's cars behind you. Bye. - The violence in D.C. sort of had rules to it. You'd be put in violent situations but you weren't doing drugs or you weren't in-confrontational that the rules sort of applied that you wouldn't get hurt. Very time you stepped across that line, then you would be in a world of extreme danger. I know people who were shot and killed. - The thing about the punk rock scene during the time period was a collision also of crack cocaine hitting the city and violence escalated. I had one friend and somebody went to his house and he let the person in and the person shot him six times and executed him. The killer then calmly closed the door behind him and left. A girl who was my friend's older sister, she was gang raped and strangled and left on the side of a road and it was her aunt that found her car and then found her body. Christina, she was an older punk girl from the scene. She was known to be pretty tough. She carried brass knuckles around with her. She went to Boston and then started dating this guy who she broke up with. He went and executed her and then killed himself. Rob, I ran into him in New York and then three hours later, he had shot six bags of heroin and overdosed. My friend Matt, almost like my brother, him and his wife were separating and the wife got a gun and walked into his work and shot him like six times, leaving his daughter without a dad. - Your friends death. I remember I put my arm around you and sitting down and talking with you about because you were terribly upset. - I've had probably a dozen friends die. The violence and the bad things that have happened in my life is one of the major things I use to push me to do something creative because when you get into those dark moments, you have choice. You can go and be more destructive. You can sink into a dark hole, or you can use that as something that allows you to do something to better yourself. To make art was a way to cope. There was no reason to have a fear of failure because I knew I'd be dead soon. I was contemplating my options. I had the choice of either going to art school or staying at home. If I had stayed home, I'd probably be dead now. - We are destination downtown and we're documenting the stories of these amazing people. Located to the Lower East Side from Washington D.C. and he is an artist and a film maker, one of the founders of the Antagonist Movement. - But the concept of coming to New York and knowing a couple of things and one was like The Warriors, the movie The Warriors, so I was like, I'm gonna come, I'm gonna have to join a gang. I'm gonna be knife fighting with everybody and then the other part is my family, we live, we have relatives in Rhode Island so we'd take the train from D.C. to Rhode Island and in that passage, all you would see is the very worst parts of New York like just rubble and burnt down buildings and all of this stuff and I was like, my god, New York City is a wasteland. I knew a lot of the local gang kids that were much tougher than me so the very first week I was there, I saw this kid walking our of Mona's Bar and crossing the projects on 11th Street and just kids from those projects throwing 40 ounce bottles at him and him running away and me going like, oh my god. This guy is covered in tattoos, he's way tougher than me, local Puerto Rican kid, there's no chance I'm gonna make it. Two days later, I was walking out of my building and another friend of mine that I had known from the punk scene drove up in his car and he's like, oh you know, how you doing? Blah blah blah and I'm like I'm good but I'm a little nervous about the neighborhood, like am I gonna get murdered in my sleep here? And he's like, no, no one's ever gonna bother you here and I go, why's that? He goes, well I happen to be in this time period, you're pretty much like the only white guy here and I'm a parole officer and I'm all of these guys' parole officer, so look at the corner. And like all the kids were watching us. And they're like, yeah, they think you're a cop now. And I was like, oh okay, great. After that meant not only did I ever have a problem. None of those kids ever talked to me ever. I came from a place where violence and death was something that was normal. Still to this day when I walk into a restaurant, I have to have my back to the wall and my eye on the door because I don't want somebody sneaking up behind me. That carries over to what I do creatively. I have anger and violence that simmers just below the surface. A little bit dangerous, a little bit rebellious and maybe a little bit criminal. - When you were about, must have been seven or eight, we took you to a psychiatrist who wanted to put you on Ritalin because the psychiatrist said that you were hyperactive, which I completely disagreed. If you were interested in something, you would sit there for hours and work on it. So I told the psychiatrist that I absolutely refused and she kind of went into a god like how dare you disagree with me, you're a bad parent, this is like child abuse. I said, well, that's the way it is. This child is not gonna be on drugs and that's the end of it. - Say no to drugs and that is probably because I don't drink or use drugs. - Your dyslexia which I think is more severe than people realize in unmanageable on alcohol or drugs and I think you like to be in control. - In order to be the best version of himself, I think Ethan's got to stay sober for the most part. - It was 1990 in New York and I started working in the bars and that's when the big change happened. There was one night I was bartending and in front of me was an actor who wasn't acting, a musician who didn't play any music, a painter who didn't paint, and a writer who didn't write and these were people I saw day after day, week after week. They were there 'till the bar closed. They stayed there after hours with me. The one thing they have in common is that they're here in the bar drinking all night every night. You have to be willing to give up something. - There was a point in time where a lot of people that we knew were doing drugs, specifically like a lot of people got into heroin. Few of those people died. Ethan's reaction to that was super worried and did whatever he could to convince those people that they should stop doing it. I'll kick your ass, I'll steal your drugs, I'll call your parents, et cetera. - The stories you hear of artists having addictions and those addictions actually helping their art, a fallacy. The reality is most people are hobbled by their addictions. I just wasn't willing to risk that. - Not everybody died, so I guess it, maybe it worked with some of them. - I remember being in a hotel with Ethan in Nashville and watching MTV and all of the sudden there was this video that I had written music for and Ethan had directed and it was so exciting. I remember sort of jumping around in a hotel room. Thank you for watching the film. I'm gonna say I'm recording now so you kind of get this thing that I record everything in my life. - There was always like a strange Hitchcock almost cameo where Ethan shows up mostly semi nude. He's usually washing some part of his anatomy or the other. - It's unfair because he always ambushes you. I have to film this thing by this date tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. I will film you. You will be filmed by me. I am Ethan Ethan Minsker. But now you're in a bunch of films. Let's talk about that, the films. - It's weird. He kind of brands it Ethan and then the artist Ethan. He puts himself a lot into movies. I don't think it's bad. There was nobody else doing it at the time. He was the only one that showed up with his camera every week and would edit it religiously and most people would have given up after the first flop. On tonight's program, we're first showing a film by Ethan Minsker. - We're here down on the Lower East Side. - I'm taking myself very seriously as a collector. - I went to New York and went to art school and then switched to film. I made a documentary called Anything Boys Can Do which covered the women bands on the Lower East Side between 92 and 94. - When I first saw Anything Boys Can Do, I was blown away that a film made in the 90s and a film that showcased rampant sexism in the music industry could still be so relevant today. - It played in over 50 festivals around the world. It was my first time of having any taste of success. - Ethan's films aren't about stories that are contrived or follow some mold. I mean, they're, all of his films are very personal. ♪ Any fool can tell what's happening ♪ ♪ When you're caught without your friends ♪ He is going to make something with the community that he's built. It's going to be about building spiritual currency and raising other people up and creating art. - All these movies have the same cast of characters so for the past 16 years, I'm in whatever it is, five, six films. - The things that I talk about today, I'm not necessarily saying that you should follow what I'm doing because what we have done before could possibly land you in jail or prison. There are local gang members in this, so we pretty much use our whole community. Once we started making the film, we had people coming up to us saying like, I hear you're making a film, I wanna be in it. I'm like, all right. Some of these guys were like, we got to put them in the film. We can't cut them out. Using guns in New York City in this time period and still today you have to have a permit to be able to rent a prop gun from the store. The permit means you have to have insurance and insurance is $2,000. This budget of the entire film is $2,000. That money went to drugs and a limo rental. That said, I had provenance from when I was a kid. The criminal element that I kind of mentioned before, we show up and be like, well, I've got this sawed off shotgun. Why don't we use that? And I'm like, all right, well now we're using real guns in the streets of New York. Two weeks before that, a gentleman was shot and killed pulling his wallet out in front of the police, so the whole neighborhood downtown was on edge. We literally had people standing on corners going, cops! And then we would break up. Everyone put the equipment away. The criminal with the gun would then take the bag and go another direction. It was just like we were dealing drugs but were dealing art. It was filmed in one scene two weeks before September 11 happened, two blocks away from the Twin Towers. The neighborhood shut down below 14th Street for three months. We still kept shooting. We kind of agreed to it. ♪ Isn't it right - Ethan works, he works a full time job. He earns enough money to pay his bills, and then he films. It takes him quite a while to finish his films because they're not financed. - I worked in the film industry. I did grip and electric. I would do assistant editing for cable networks and the thing I would find most common is that the projects I worked on were predictable and cliche. I will never be that theatrical success. I'd prefer to make my little odd films that are geared towards like minded individuals documenting subcultures and unknown artists. It inspired me to wanna get more involved, to have a bigger influence. I just really wasn't sure how to go about doing that. The dynamic of living in New York is everybody moves here because they wanna do something creative. If you don't wanna move here because of that, you're moving here because you wanna be around people who are doing something creative. Unfortunately, the rents make that very hard because you become a slave to your job so you're stuck in a cycle of having to work to pay your rent and not doing what you're doing creatively. The dynamics of the bars is they want people there and they wanna make money, so we said, hey, you got this room in the back of the bar. Why don't we do one night art shows. We did that for 11 years. We showed over 3,000 artists and the reason it worked is because you were giving people a chance without having to worry about the economics of a gallery. There was huge room for experimentation so you couldn't say that those same elements didn't exist in other cities, they did. There were other cities all over the world where there was cheap rent, but they didn't have as many art movements birthed out of them as New York City did, as Punk Rock, as Hip Hop, as the Beatnik. The thing about New York that's unique is that it brings everybody together and those people who have diverse perspectives can come up with something unique. ♪ Art talk ♪ Just doing some good old art talk ♪ ♪ With your host Ethan Minsker If you're trying to do something creative, you have to look at the resources and assess your situation in your environment and New York is uniquely suited to doing creative things. All of those materials and elements are there and if you become crafty enough, you can figure out ways you can do these projects for little or no cost. New York had all of the creative elements that I would need to be able to pursue my dreams. It's a city full of people just like myself who are desperate to do something. ♪ Not just a new idea but Building a community like that was the birthplace for starting the Antagonist Art Movement. We try to go into the community, engage the community, and then build our larger community through outreach. What kind of advice would you give to those people listening? - I'd say the major thing with us is that artists in general are solitary and by working together as a group, it gives you a lot more options open up. I'm the head curator and organizer for a group called the Antagonist Art Movement. We're based out of New York City but we work with artists around the world. Part of our mission statement is to create venues and projects that allow unrecognized artists to develop their talent. Our goal is to act as a laboratory to allow people to experiment without the ramifications of the economics that are associated with the art market. - It's known the art world now. It's just a place, it's about money and moving and shaking and it's not really about discovering artists or any of that anymore. So as artists, we have to carry on in our own sort of collective way. - Ethan hasn't just built an organization that's helped so many people and so many creatives in the Lower East Side, but he's helping to uphold the legacy of the Lower East Side and the creative history of his neighborhood. - We were gonna do our own thing and actually create things that are interesting and unique. - Antagonist Movement was my gateway to New York City. When I moved here, I had nothing and Ethan got me a job. - Huge part of my 20s and my development as an artist. - He got me writing. - The Antagonist art movement is a family to me. And kind of a cult, let's be real. - Comparing it to some of the other artistic communities which to me were much more elitist. - In a strange place where you never find a leader, we found Ethan Minsker or he found us, I don't know. - The art market, overwhelming percent of artists that are successful are from the same economic class that owns and runs the galleries. They go to the same few select master programs. We select art purely based on the content quality of the art. We separate the concept of who the artist is. The antagonist is the one who pushes the protagonist to action so we're not trying to be the hero. We're trying to get the hero to go off and do the adventure. I worked at galleries and art handler and it's a very closed off system. How can a gallery afford this space to pay my salary and everybody else is that they have to have artists that can cover that. It was 2003 when we met Arturo Vega. Arturo was the artistic director for the Ramones. He did their t-shirt design, they rehearsed in his loft. He was a mixing spoon where he would take people from different elements and backgrounds and introduce them to each other and try to get them to collaborate. Our art movement and all the work I've personally done has been always referencing punk rock so when you have somebody like Arturo who comes along and isn't just passing through but takes notice of what you're doing, gets involved, and wants to push you to do more and become friends with us is massive. Arturo would curate shows for us, he would mentor artists, advise us, but for me personally, he was like the artistic father that I never had. Arturo brought us Richard Hambleton who showed with us in the pop up gallery we had in the basement of a bar. He hadn't shown in more than 20 years so that was kind of a big deal for us. - If we were to stare. We love you Arturo, we love you. Who's the cutest? - I think an Antagonist is not about being beautiful. It's about being beautiful and getting away with it. - Arturo died suddenly in 2013. It broke my heart but Arturo would have been the first one to tell you that you don't mourn someone's death, you celebrate it. There are times when I felt like slowing down I could feel this kind of voice in the back of my head. What you're doing is good, it's good for the community. When you get in this conversation, like how do we know each other? Oh yeah, you don't remember? Arturo introduced us. He was bringing us these lost puppies but all the lost puppies is really what made up the bulk of our group. - And those people eventually got careers and became established and some of them became world recognized. There are a few people that have become successful, Jonah Hill. - 'Cause I'm a moron, dude. My shit's not very well spoken at all. Trust me, I'll be the first one to say. - He was a kid off the street that came in and started reading in our group. We moved him up to headliner. Dustin Hoffman's kids came in and said, I want you to meet my dad. He's doing a movie called I Love the Huckabees which was Jonah Hill's first movie and then took off. The whole point is to try to make it something unique that changes everything so if we make into mainstream status, that's fine as long as you keep the integrity of what you're doing. We had done so many shows in New York and felt like we weren't really getting anywhere so we decided to do shows overseas. - I actually find you guys really easy to deal with since you've done a lot of these exhibitions internationally. There was a lot of encouragement there. I like the fact that you guys do antagonize me 'cause when you've got a year to work on a show, you tend to sort of be a little bit laid back, especially if you're Australian. - I was brought to this project by Ethan. Conversation started about over a year ago. I met Ethan through some friends at a barbecue in New Jersey in the Hoboken of all places. - The overseas projects, we would work with local artists in tandem to come up with a theme. - Back in 2007 in Berlin I met Antagonist. We did an art show there together. They influenced us to do these art shows where everyone can show. I'm living in New York and the Antagonists helped me find jobs. - By doing those, we would make connections that would last for years. - I came to New York and they introduced me to a lot of people and opportunities. Then I started working on some of their projects like zines and films and art shows. Now I'm trapped forever. - October we're doing the Dwelling Project in Sydney, Australia. We're asking people to make buildings out of recycled materials and then we'll construct a city in the gallery. Half the buildings and works you see here are a performance art. I will come in as Godzilla and destroy it because I love doing that. The deeper part of it is that it's about the loss of your home and how people all around the world constantly there's someone losing their home and a lot of people watch it on the news and don't really feel it personally. ♪ Lemonade lemonade ♪ Lemonade lemonade gimme gimme lemonade ♪ ♪ Lemonade lemonade oh - One of my first shows I've ever done as an artist kind of gave me an early sense of a feeling of community. I designed the latest Antagonist movement logo and traditionally, the logo itself has been designed by a different artist every couple of years keeping the same theme of a ninja inside of a black circle with Antagonist Movement around it. - If you get that collective Antagonist stuff in enough different spots, somebody will discover it. ♪ Places will be hard to find - This neighborhood really represented this sort of spirit of independent art and making something that was new. When I came here, I was like, I wanna start a group. I wanna make something new. All I wanna do is at least be the liner note in somebody else's story where we're like, we helped that person make something huge and change everything. The Antagonist Movement for me was a school. It taught me how to work with other artists. It gave me a greater and deeper understanding of all of the possibilities of art out there and not to be limited by just trying out one genre. It gave me the courage to try things that were risky and in doing so, it sharpened and honed my ability. - Affecting individual peoples' lives in New York which is such a dehumanizing place at times. - And I think it's good because I think we're some of the last left in the Alamo. - In 2011, we lost the space where we did our events. It's not really about the actually shows. It's not about the physical art. It's about the connections and the personality of the people we work with and those connections are what are really the fundamental crux of the Antagonist Movement because those carry on much longer than the show. - I think his strongest talent is building communities. - It started with me reading Ernest Hemingway and Henry Miller books. There's these parts where they talk about going to the beach and vacationing with a group of artists of different backgrounds. ♪ Words that calm me It would be the starting place for new concepts and ideas so once a year, I would get a bunch of artists and we would save up some money and split the rental cost of a house. There was something about getting outside of your environment that led to new concepts that it gives you more opportunity because you're tapping into the knowledge of all of the different people. Over the years, the artist retreat morphed into the art brunch and the art brunch now is something we do once a month. I think as an artist it's easy to get stuck in your projects so you should have something built into your routine that is a social element. All of my friendships and socializing are done through what I do creatively. The art brunch is a place where people can give me critical feedback on my projects. I started trying to think of what could be the next step that could supplement those things. - In 2011, Ethan and his family and the Antagonist Art Movement sent me back to NYU to study philanthropy and fund raising. From there, I learned how to do grant writing, accounting, budgeting and everything under the sun for non-profit organizations. With these art projects we do, we go to other countries and then we search out kids from disadvantaged youth, hard backgrounds and we try to teach them in workshops. The thing I found amazing about that is you see these kids who maybe are not interested in writing or not interested in art but are very creative and once you show them that sort of avenue of expression, then it flips everything around. Like the same thing with myself. - Shannon, Ethan, and I are all directors on the board for the non-profit Citizens For The Arts. - In 2013, we were granted non-profit status. - This is the next step. It's opened a number of opportunities. We don't only do art projects. We do things that are kind of in a humanitarian realm. - When you feel that you've been doing the same thing for a certain amount of years, you have to actively go out and try to do something that you're not comfortable with. - There is a lot of challenges that we're facing. - I had this idea in my head that once we became a non-profit that everybody would just start throwing at us, but it's like hard to get five dollars out of somebody, let alone 500 or 5,000. - You went from having a large base of people but at the end of the day, there's only three people doing it so it's starting at square one and we end up putting our own money into it. I think we've done quite well. - You're never going to progress if you just stay in the same place. Hello. Today on Film Festival, we'll have a couple of boys trying to make fools of themselves. Now, let's go and watch. I think as an artist you also should be a collector. It's a good way not only for you to collect great work but it's also a way for you to get your work injected into somebody else's collection. I use my hallways like a mini gallery and this reflects the work from all of the one night art shows we did for 11 years. Come on in here. When we used to do the pop up gallery, one of our things was doing group shows based on a theme. For this painting, it was obscure dictators. Normal people portrayed as great dictators. And over here is a painting from our great Caffeinate and Decimate show which was the combination of mixing caffeine and handguns. - Oh god, it's so narcissistic. Who would make the film about themselves? What I find frustrating today in making art is that it's this celebrity cult that is the fascination of making success, especially within the media. If I write a book and try to get a publisher or an agent to pick it up, the first thing they wanna know is, well, who did you kill or who did you fuck? Do you have an Instagram account? - Ethan is like the most horribly obnoxious self promoting person I know. - Hashtag us, join us on Instagram, join us on Facebook, tell your friends, spread the word. We're famous for four blocks on the Lower East Side. Outside of that, nobody seems to know us. - Why is anyone going to pick my book off the shelf? Here there's always a choice, so if we don't self promote, I don't know how anybody discovers our work anymore. - Because I don't expect anybody to come down and save my ass. If I don't do it myself, it ain't gonna happen. - You have to embrace the egotistical side of making art. If the average person picked up a Picasso and looked at it, they would go, what the fuck is this shit? But Picasso was an expert at making sure that people believed it was the absolute best art that ever graced this earth. So did Andy Warhol. You have to have the personality behind it. I'm ready for combat. This is apart of the outfit I'm wearing is actually like my event suit so I have to show this part too. Oh, very nice. - I feel art is combat. You have to be ready for war. Here you go, sorry Mis. Most people are consumers. I personally would rather be a producer. ♪ Take my winter When people see me in my camo suit, this is a reference to writers like Truman Capote or Mark Twain. Even though their suits were white, your outward appearance is an extension of your creative expression. I decided I would start focusing on my personal projects. I'm never gonna be satisfied with what I do creatively. That's probably at the same time the part of the machine that makes me keep taking on new projects and trying new things. I just have to learn to give up the concept of mainstream success but it would be nice to have a paycheck. - As long as I've known you, it seems like your whole style of creation has always been collaborative. I don't know how you get so much fucking shit done. It's crazy and you don't care if it's not perfect right away, you just make it and that's admirable to me. - I wanted to try to make a book. The first book I wrote was Rich Boy Cries for Momma. - You weren't able to find a conventional publisher, so you resorted to self publishing. - He self publishes his own writing but he goes to great lengths for the quality of every zine and book that he does. He gets great people to do the artwork and to help him design the book, to edit the book, so in the end, what he has is just a really great piece of art in itself. - This one is about the D.C. punk scene, about some of my friends getting murdered, but it's a comedy too. And Barstool Prophets, that's about the New York City bar scene and all that. - I read Barstool Prophets and just thought it was great. It was a great introduction to the city of New York, especially the East Village because it takes place between 1993 and about 2014 and you get to see all the changes that go on through the eyes of a bartender and of course, bartenders have the best stories, so. - I just knew that he wrote and I knee that he was dyslexic but I hadn't really considered what the two of those things meant until after I started editing his raw work and then I was like, shit, this has to actually be a struggle. I admire that you still choose to do it. I would have to read everything out loud so that he could hear, visualize and edit in his mind. - Being dyslexic and writing a book is on the level of a blind man painting. It's a thorough process of editing and normally a book has one editor and has a copy editor while I have six people who help me edit the book and dozens and dozens of people who read over it. It's a collaborative effort. I'm never gonna be able to just take a typewriter and write out a book without a lot of supervision. - His work is a lot like the films he makes. Everything is within the frame. - Making my art, I recognize I'm making a deal with the devil and in the details of that contract state is that you have to be willing to put more of your private self out into the greater world. You risk being criticized and ridiculed. The art world is full of bullies just like any other part of society. - Now I've been getting criticized since I've been a kid. It's one of the byproducts of being learning disabled. I've collected the criticism and bad reviews. I call them my little family of enemies and I keep them around and use them as something that motivates me because I need to prove them all wrong. - Ethan is always ready for the consequences. Actually, he's looking for the fight. - It pushes my art to be better. I don't think any artist starts out polished and perfect. It's in your failures that you become better. This man is up here 30,000 feet above the World Trade Center. Sir, do you have life insurance? What? I guess he didn't. - When September 11 happened, I got a phone call at nine in the morning. My phone never rings at nine in the morning and when I came out into the living room, after the buildings had fallen, you could see ash right outside this window. Picking up my camera and filming gave me the illusion of control. It was a way of processing the events that were unfolding around me. By me is where the World Trade Centers used to stand. It's now been a week. I don't have the ability to suppress emotions so I have to figure out ways I can work through them and doing something creative has always been that key for me. It's the one thing that keeps my sanity in check. Those were tapes I hadn't looked at in 17 years. It was just something I filmed and put away. Couple of the people that used to come in the bar are definitely now missing or, I guess the word isn't missing anymore. They're dead. I was nervous about doing the performance art. Once I started, I fell into this meditative state. There's a feeling I derive from the work that I do, a mixture of comfort and satisfaction and that feeling can be a very powerful and addictive force. You can't help thinking about the people who lost their lives. I understand when they're watching the performance art it's going to look very childish, it's going look like a kid just having fun again. I want the viewer to have that disconnection, not to understand the real kind of personal emotion behind it. Maybe later if they see this film, their concept of what they saw will change. Living in New York right now is just like living in a war. ♪ Stay ♪ Trading laughs again Okay there's a story you like to tell about me over and over again. - We were walking from the 9:30 Club to D.C. Space which was a smaller club a couple of blocks away down a dark street and a crack head comes up to us with his hand in his jacket as if he has a gun and Ethan says, you don't have a fucking gun and you better fucking have a gun if you're gonna pull that shit and I'm just terrified because if I was that crack head, I would have just shot Ethan, but the reality was, the guy didn't have a gun and when Ethan challenged him, he just said, yeah, I don't have a gun and turned around and walked away very matter of factly. - I've had guns pulled on me three times. The project I've been focusing on in the last year has been Ghost Guns and the concept is related to a lot of my friends who died as a result of gun violence and I wanted to make these paper mache guns that act as a memorial to the victims of gun violence. The thing in the United States is everyone feels it's impossible to do anything about handguns and I don't believe rolling over and giving up is the answer. ♪ They say I enjoy shooting guns but if it meant saving one life, I'd be happy to give up that right in a moment. As a kid, you watch these movies where the gun is always presented as the catalyst for action and adventure but the reality is is when you become an adult, you can see the gun being unmasked for what it truly is, a tool of death, destruction, and sadness. I'll always incorporate guns into my artwork, but its symbolism has changed from being the hero to the villain. ♪ Who denounces all of you ♪ Bad manner round me My bed and my shelving I designed. This is based on Frank Lloyd Wright and his designs but the funny thing is is that Frank Lloyd Wright, he did storage, so almost every one of his houses was build without any storage so what I did is I built storage units based on his aesthetic and design. It's pretty rude, right? - Any project that he does, it drives me insane because the space is very small and he takes up the whole space whether it's the kitchen, the living room. - In here's where I put my shitty paintings. The latest works I've been doing have been called A Boy's Dream where I make a variety of different war scenes where there's like battleships from all different eras and tanks from all different eras. - I get claustrophobic and this shit is everywhere. - This wall is a collection of all the weird sort of things that have inspired me and then just pieces that I've worked on and then ended up on this shelf. - It's like I'm living in an art studio. It doesn't feel like a home. - Seven years old, I made this box. How did you make it? Wood and paint and then stripped off many layers of paint. - It just feels like somebody vomited art everywhere. - Any good tips for good parenting? - You only have two functions as a parent in New York and every parent should learn it. As long as your kid does not join gangs and does not become a drug addict, you've done a great job. That's it. ♪ Turned on the light when I needed the dark ♪ - He was a little reluctant to become a family man. I think he's worked through that and he's kind of the best version of himself now because of it. ♪ Took a swim when I needed to drown ♪ - My father was one of the greatest workaholics of all time. Your mom and I would say that was one of the things that led to our breaking up. The expectation that we would equally divide the work up then that's involved with the care of children and your mom thought that I didn't participate in my share and she was right. I was so wrapped up in my career and working for the firm and succeeding on my cases and I neglected to spend time with you and Natasha. ♪ Took a walk but I needed to run ♪ - When I first met Ethan, one phrase stuck with me and he told me that he's never going to stop creating no matter what and I thought, never? That's crazy. After we started dating, I saw how incredibly persistent he was. I admire him tremendously. I didn't want him to stop making art but after we had the baby, I hoped that he would be more involved with taking care of the kid 'cause when you have a baby, you got to sacrifice some stuff so it really annoys me, irritates me that he's constantly making art, but at the same time, I see that he is making art now with his daughter so that it became their project, not just his project. That's pretty amazing. ♪ There are times in your songs ♪ - I like bed that you made. Do you wanna see it? Come. - Yeah. So who's the best dad ever? If your kid is afraid of monsters under the bed, you know what you got to put under there? Lights. Lights under the bed. Yeah. Yeah, why? - So the monsters won't, the monster will go away. - Because if you're a monster and you're hanging out under a bed then you better have sunblock 'cause this is a darn bright bed. - Yeah because you can't add it like at the light store. - Yeah and before you skeptics out there say, yeah, but you're gonna catch your kid's bed on fire, these are LED and they're not hot and they don't put out a lot of energy so energy efficient keeps the monsters away. Any last words? - Yeah and it puts, LEDs explodes the monsters. But now we spend a lot of time under the bed, right? Yeah and now we can explore it. - Okay so best dad ever, yeah, right here. My very first girlfriend, I was like deeply in love with her and it turned out she slept with basically everybody I knew. It was hard to really trust anybody thoroughly after that had happened to you. I didn't date anybody that I didn't like. I think my major problem is that I always felt like I was going to be abandoned so if I had the opportunity to fall in love with somebody, I would. The problem is is that I've probably fallen in love with too many people at the same time. I don't think I ever did anything really bad to the girls I dated. I really did care for every single one of them, but I dated multiple people and feelings were hurt. My friends who worked in the bars were always saying, like look. If you have a kid, it's definitely gonna be a girl and you're gonna suffer the consequence of all the things you've done to these women you've dated. As a kid I was watching PBS and there was a documentary on an animator who worked on the Betty Boop shows. The guy just seemed to emanate happiness and then the name comes up on the bottom of the credits and his name was Grim, the most depressing name you could ever have on a person is name your son Grim. I had this thought like, well, there's so many people that I know that are named Happy and Smiley and they're all miserable fucking people so if I'm gonna have a kid, I'm gonna name it something sad but I'm not gonna call him Sad and I'm definitely not gonna call him Grim, so Blu was a name that I came up with because Blue represents sadness, it represents color. It could potentially be the name of a stripper, but for my daughter, I felt if I gave the Johnny Cash name A Boy Named Sue element to it and name her something that's sad, she'll have a life filled with joy. ♪ You're walking with an angel going home ♪ You look silly. You should look at yourself. When I did have a daughter, I had this first instinct of like all these boys are gonna do such horrible things to my daughter. Then I said, wait a minute, that's ridiculous, and in fact, I'm gonna give her all of the knowledge of what it's like coming from a boy's perspective. If anything, I think I'm gonna have to be pulling aside that little boy and saying like, I'm really sorry whatever my daughter's about to do to you. - I'm sure having a kid changed your world. I'm sure on a certain level, not that you weren't serious about your art before, you were probably serious as death, but this is a different kind of seriousness. It's a more mature kind of seriousness. Bigger pressure. ♪ Took a smoke 'cause I needed one ♪ - I want the door. - All right, now flat. I want the door to be open. Okay here, here you go. Lie down and flat. Okay, where should I lie down? - Here. That one. - Blu sits in a bed and her father sits next to her reading a book. You know, I spend a lot of time reading kids books and the majority of them are horrible so yeah, I'm gonna make a kids book with my daughter. ♪ Someone has told me Oh no. How many kids out there can say that they actually have a book about them? I don't see a difference between parenting and being an artist. My daughter is the greatest art project I've ever made. - One of Ethan's gifts and I'll give him this begrudgingly because he doesn't deserve any praise whatsoever is that his entire life from when he wakes up in the morning from the very first moment he opens his eyes 'till the moment he closes his eyes, he's thinking about ways he can challenge himself and his cohorts into being creative and do acts that transcend the banality of daily life. This is the third year here and we're trying to build community really of the avant garde and conceptual artists and creative people that have made major contributions to the scene that we know.
