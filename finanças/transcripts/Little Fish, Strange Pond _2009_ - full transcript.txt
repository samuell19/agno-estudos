I GOT SOMETHING YOU CAN SLAM; I GOT SOMETHING YOU CAN SNORT; I GOT SOMETHING YOU CAN SWALLOW; I GOT SOMETHING YOU CAN CHEW; I GOT SOMETHING YOU CAN SMOKE. YOU STILL LIKE WEED? WEED'S ALL RIGHT, BUT I WANT YOUR SOMETHING SPECIAL. - H? - NO. - HOW ABOUT METH? - I THINK NOT. I WANT YOUR SOMETHING SPECIAL. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, MR. JACK. PEOPLE COME TO ME FOR ONE REASON, AND THAT'S BECAUSE I SELL THE BEST SHIT IN THE CITY, IN ADDITION TO THE BEST PORNOGRAPHIC CINEMA FROM HERE TO VENICE. AND PEOPLE THAT DO COME IN HERE, THEY KNOW MY ONE RULE. AND THAT'S &quot;DON'T FUCK AROUND.&quot; I MADE THAT UP. I MADE THAT SIGN. REMEMBER THAT LITTLE SQUIRT THAT WAS IN HERE EARLIER? WELL, HE LIVED BY MY CREDO. HE KNEW WHAT HE WANTED AND HE DIDN'T FUCK AROUND. AND I RESPECTED HIM FOR IT. THAT'S WHY I SOLD HIM HIS FILM. AND HE'S GONNA BE MORE OF A MAN THAN YOU CAN I COULD EVER DREAM TO BE. NOW, MR. JACK FROM THE OUTBACK... I'M NOT FROM AUSTRALIA. LIKE I GIVE A FUCK WHERE YOU'RE FROM. IF YOU'D QUIT FUCKING AROUND AND TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT, WE'D BOTH BE HAPPIER MEN, YOU SEE? I MEAN-- DID YOU EVER THINK MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT? I'M FULL OF SHIT? YOU SAY, &quot;I HAVE A CREDO: DON'T FUCK AROUND. BLAH BLAH BLAH.&quot; WELL, BUCKY, I'M CALLING A SPADE A SPADE AND A HYPOCRITE THE SAME. - ( laughs ) - YOU WANT ME TO ASK FOR YOUR SOMETHING SPECIAL. WELL, I DID. SO PULL IN THE LINE YOU'VE BEEN FISHING WITH, BECAUSE IF FUCKING AROUND WERE A BEAUTY PAGEANT, YOU'D HAVE A GOLD SASH AROUND YOUR WAIST RIGHT NOW. KNOW WHAT I MEAN? ( laughs ) I LIKE YOUR STYLE, MR. JACK. I DON'T LIKE YOUR CLOTHES, BUT I LIKE YOUR STYLE. SO... AHEM. THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. IT'S THE, UM, SOMETHING SPECIAL. WHAT'S THE DAMAGE? - WHAT, TO YOUR BODY? - NO, TO MY WALLET. - FIRST ONE'S FREE. - OH, I LIKE THAT PRICE. WELL, HERE'S TO SOMETHING SPECIAL. ( instrumental music surging ) ( bells ring ) OH, FUCK. HEY, MR. RED EYES? MR. RED EYES? YOU EVER BEEN IN A ROBBERY? - COME ON. - ( snapping ) STORE CLERK! AND STORE OWNER? FIRST NAME BUCKY. AND UNKNOWN CUSTOMER #2, GET AWAY FROM THE BACK ROOM AND JOIN UNKNOWN CUSTOMER #1 AND COME FORWARD. - HELLO. - OKAY, WHAT DO YOU WANT? AND LET'S SPEAK CANDIDLY HERE, BECAUSE I HAVE THIS CREDO THAT I LIVE BY-- DON'T FUCK AROUND, FRIEND. OH, GIVE THIS MAN A CIGAR! YEAH, THAT'S MY MOTTO. YOU WANT SOME DOUGH?

YOU WON'T BE LEARNING MY LAST NAME, BUT DON'T LET THAT GET YOU DOWN. IT'S AN UNREMARKABLE NAME. I'M THE ROBBER AND YOU'RE MY VICTIMS. - UM... - YES? - VICTIMS? - JUST POOR CHOICE OF WORDS. AH, I AM THE HOLDER-UPPER AND YOU ARE MY HOLDER-UPPEES, BETTER? - BETTER, THANK YOU. - GOOD. OH. REAL QUICK ABOUT ME-- I LIVE HERE IN L.A. ANYBODY ELSE HERE FROM L.A.? YOU GOTTA LOVE THIS CITY, RIGHT? LITTLE CRIME PROBLEM THOUGH, YOU KNOW? THIS GUY I KNOW-- REAL FUCKING CRIMINAL-- HE FOLLOWS THIS OTHER GUY ON FOOT FOR HALF A MILE WEST. FINALLY, THE OTHER GUY HANGS A RIGHT. HI, BUDDY. FOLLOWS HIM. SON OF A BITCH TURNS AROUND, MUGS HIM. IT'S GETTING DANGEROUS OUT THERE. ( laughs ) GETTING DANGEROUS. GETTING DANG-- OH. THIS IS MY FIRST ROBBERY. UH, I'VE DRIVEN GETAWAY A FEW TIMES. AND THIS IS MY FIRST LEAD JOB HERE AT THE BEAUTIFUL SKIN TO WIN VIDEO ESCAPADE. AND I AM DAMN GLAD TO BE HERE. OH, TWO-- INTENTIONS AND REQUEST. MY INTENTION IS TO ROB YOU. AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO IT WITH NO LIP. OR AS BUCKY-- AS YOU SO ELOQUENTLY SAID, &quot;DON'T FUCK AROUND.&quot; RIGHT? SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, I WOULD LIKE YOU ALL TO EMPTY YOUR POCKETS. OH. ( gunshots ) OH GOD, THAT MUST HAVE COME OFF AS REALLY CRASS. UH, SIR? COME HERE. COME ON. COME ON, COME ON. OKAY, I-- I SHOULD EXPLAIN. ALL RIGHT? I GOT THIS LIST. IT'S MY FIRST ROBBERY. I BROUGHT ALONG A RUNNING ORDER OF HOW THINGS SHOULD BE DONE CORRECTLY, CHRONOLOGICALLY. AND THIS LIST WAS MADE BY THE BEST-- MR. LAVEL JOHNSON. WHO THE FUCK IS LAVEL JOHNSON? HAVE SOME, UH, RESPECT FOR THE DEAD, BUCKY. SEE, FIRST I DID #1, THE INTRODUCTION. I SAID MY NAME AND A FEW THINGS ABOUT ME. AND THEN I DID #3-- THE INTENTION AND THE REQUEST. YOU KNOW, I SAID WHAT I WAS DOING AND WHAT I WANTED YOU TO DO. BUT YOU SEE WHAT I DID THERE, RIGHT? IS I SKIPPED OVER #2. RIGHT? THE SERIOUSNESS FACTOR, WHICH INVOLVED WASTING A CLERK. I MEAN, YOU DO THAT, NOBODY IN THEIR RIGHT MIND IS GOING TO GIVE YOU ANY SHIT. &quot;AND IF YOU'VE GOT SOMEONE NOT IN THEIR RIGHT MIND, THAT'S CALLED DUMB LUCK. YOU JUST GOT TO SAY A PRAYER AND RIDE THAT STORM OUT&quot;-- LAVEL JOHNSON, 2004. YEAH? WHAT'S #4? AH. OH. ( laughs ) WE REALLY SHOULD JUST PRESS ON. SOME OF THE TITLES ARE FUNNY. JUST TAKE WHAT YOU WANT AND GET OUT ALREADY. HOW LONG IS THIS GONNA FUCKING TAKE? DON'T MISTAKE THE FACT THAT I DID NOT KILL THE STORE OWNER FOR A SIGN THAT ANYBODY IS IN CHARGE BESIDES ME. DO YOU HAVE ANY OF TRACI LORDS'S EARLY WORK? - YOU LIKE TRACI LORDS? - YOU TOO? - YEAH. - NO I DON'T. IT IS ILLEGAL TO CARRY THEM. SHE WAS 14 WHEN SHE MADE THEM, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. EXCUSE ME? QUESTION. YOU'RE ROBBING A PORNO STORE? WHAT OF IT? WHY WOULD ANYONE DO SUCH A THING? ( laughs ) MY OWN BUSINESS, MY OWN REASONS. THAT'S WHY. WELL, YOU MIND IF I THINK ON IT AWHILE? I'M AMAZINGLY RESOURCEFUL WHEN IT COMES TO THINGS LIKE THIS. SURE, GIVE IT SOME THOUGHT. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? - MR. JACK. - SWEET STEPHEN. I WAS TALKING TO MR. JACK, SO YOU CAN SHUT YOUR CAKE. - SHUT YOUR CAKE. - ( laughing ) I LIKE THE ACCENT, MR. JACK. - LIVERPOOL. - SORT OF. - HE'S NOT FROM ENGLAND. - CAKE! NICE NAME YOU'VE GOT, PHILLY. SHORT FOR PHILLIP? - NOPE. -PHILADELPHIA? MINNESOTA BY WAY OF MISSISSIPPI. BIG CREAM-CHEESE FAN THEN? HATE THE STUFF. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? YOU DON'T SEEM THE TYPE TO FREQUENT SLEAZY VIDEO STORES. I'M GETTING IN TOUCH WITH MY MANLY SIDE. OH. WHAT ABOUT YOU? I'M MAKING ENDS MEET. OR MAKING THE ENDS JUSTIFY THE MEANS. - WHAT? - YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. YOU ROB A PORNO STORE; YOU CARRY A LIST-- A LIST WRITTEN BY A DEAD MAN. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO KILL THAT GUY, YOU KNOW? A FEW WELL-PLACED THREATS, WE'D HAVE BEEN IN YOUR HANDS. BUT YOU NEED TO FOLLOW A LIST. DO YOU EVEN HAVE A GETAWAY PLAN? DILLINGER YOU'RE NOT, MY FRIEND. AND I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE OF THE MULTIPLE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS? WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT. MAYBE I SHOULD START MAKING MY OWN DECISIONS. DECISIONS ON MY OWN. I MEAN, I CAN JUST SEE THOSE HEADLINES: &quot;PORN STORE ROBBERY BECOMES BLOODBATH. NO SUSPECTS.&quot; - NO, IT'S NOT IN YOUR NATURE. - HE'S RIGHT. WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS? &quot;MY ROBBERY WITH ANDRE&quot;? JESUS CHRIST. WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I KILLED THIS GUY. I HATE TO KEEP HARPING ON THIS, BUT THE ONLY REASON YOU KILLED THAT GUY WAS BECAUSE OF THAT LIST. FACE IT, MAN, YOU'RE NO KILLER. IN ORDER TO KILL SOMEONE-- TO REALLY KILL SOMEONE, - YOU'VE GOT TO WANT IT. - Stephen: YEAH. HMM? IF I KILL-- IF I KILLED BUCKY-- IF I-- IF I PUT THIS GUN UP HIS ASS, PULLED THE TRIGGER TILL HIS COLON SAID &quot;NO MáS&quot;... COULD THE TWO OF YOU ADMIT THAT I COULD BE A KILLER? I THINK YOU COULD DO ANYTHING YOU WANT. BUT I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO DO ANYTHING YOU DON'T WANT. YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT. YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT. YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT. - YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT. - THE FUCK I WON'T. ♪ YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT, YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT ♪ ♪ YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT, YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT ♪ - ♪ YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT, YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT... ♪ - FUCK! - ♪ YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT. ♪ - AH! GOD DAMN IT! YOU'RE RIGHT. I CAN'T KILL THIS MAN. NO, I CANNOT KILL THIS MAN BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT TO. YOU TWO, ON THE OTHER HAND, I THINK MAYBE I COULD WORK WITH. ( gunshot ) ( applause ) PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE EXCUSE ME. ( voice breaking ) I'M... I DON'T-- I DON'T LIKE LOSING IT LIKE THIS IN FRONT OF YOU PEOPLE, YOU KNOW? SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO BE THE ROCK, THE ONE THAT TAKES IT ON THE CHIN, THE STRONG ONE, THE ONE THAT PRESSES THROUGH; SOME TOUGH GUY TO BE THE FATHER, MOTHER, BROTHER AND FRIEND OF EVERY GUEST ON THIS STAGE. SO IF I-- IF I LOSE IT EVERY NOW AND THEN, THEN THAT'S THE PRICE A LIVE TV SHOW, OKAY? YOU KNOW? AND IT'S ABOUT YOU, MA'AM. - OH MY GOD! - AND IT'S ABOUT YOU. AND YOU, SIR. AND YOU. AND ABOUT YOU, KENNY EDWARDS. ( applause fades ) WELL, LOOKS LIKE I'VE GOT JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING I NEED. SIR, HOW-- - HOW'D YOU SPELL MY NAME? - HMM? IT-- I SPELL IT WITH A P-H, YOU KNOW? S-T-E-P-H-E-N. NOT S-T-E-V-E-N. GOT IT. AND SWEET IS WITH TWO Es, I SUPPOSE? PERFECT. THANK YOU. SO THE GUY WAS REALLY ROBBING A PORNO STORE, HMM? MR. JACK? WHY DO YOU THINK THIS GUY WAS ROBBING THE SKIN TO WIN? I HAVE NO IDEA. 'CAUSE IT'S A STRANGE CHOICE. OH, I ALMOST FORGOT, I GOT BUCKY'S STATEMENT RIGHT BEFORE I TOOK YOURS. HE SAID-- AND I'M PARAPHRASING SO NOT TO OFFEND YOU TWO-- UH, THAT YOU ARE BOTH UNWELCOME IN HIS STORE FROM NOW UNTIL FOREVER. - BANNED? - BANISHED? - EXILED? - FUCKIN' HORRIBLE. YOU TWO GOT A THING TOGETHER, LIKE A TALKING THING. - LIKE WE... - ...TALK OVER EACH OTHER? - NEVER. - EVER. YOU MADE A REAL MESS OF OLD PHILLY BACK THERE. LET ME GUESS: HE DIDN'T MAKE IT, DID HE? NO. NO HE DIDN'T. I ALMOST SHIT IN MY PANTS WHEN YOU SHOT HIM IN THE HEAD. MIND YOU, WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD IT ANY OTHER WAY. YOU TWO ARE FUCKING STRANGE. WELL, WE'RE FREE TO GO THEN? NO. YEAH, YOU CAN GO. AH, YOU! THERE'S SOMEPLACE I GOTTA BE RIGHT NOW-- DISTURBANCE COMPLAINT. I WANT TO THANK YOU, TOMMY THE COP. OF COURSE, ALL YOU REALLY DID WAS WALK INTO A SITUATION YOU HAD NO CONTROL OVER, PULL OUT YOUR GUN, FIRE IT LIKE SAM PECKINPAH JUST CRIED &quot;ACTION.&quot; I GUESS THAT'S RIGHT. ♪ SOME HIT JACKPOT, SOME GET LUCKY ♪ ♪ SOME THEY RUN, THEY DON'T WANNA BE FUCKED WITH ♪ ♪ SOME HIT JACKPOT, SOME GET LUCKY ♪ ♪ SOME THEY RUN, THEY DON'T WANNA BE FUCKED WITH ♪ ♪ SOME HIT JACKPOT, SOME GET LUCKY ♪ ♪ SOME THEY RUN, THEY DON'T WANNA BE FUCKED WITH... ♪ SO HEY, DO YOU KNOW WHY PHILLY ROBBED THE PORNO STORE OR NOT? THE ANSWER IS YES. AND IF YOU GAVE IT SOME THOUGHT, YOU'D KNOW TOO. I DON'T LIKE THINKING. YOU JUST TELL ME. THE ANSWER IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR STEPHEN-- EVIL BEGETS EVIL. WELL, WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? IT MEANS THAT THERE IS A LOGICAL AND NATURAL FORCE IN THE WORLD. IT PRESERVES THINGS SPHERICALLY. EVERYTHING THAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND. WHAT GOES UP MUST COME DOWN. - YOU WITH ME? - I'M WITH YOU SO FAR. GOOD WORK AND HARD EFFORT WILL UNDOUBTEDLY REAP REWARD. DO SOMETHING GOOD; SOMETHING GOOD WILL COME FROM IT. - RIGHT? - RIGHT. WELL, THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE-- DO SOMETHING WICKED; SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES. EQUATE THIS TO THE FUCKING PORNO STORE. WELL, CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF, THE SELLING OF SEX IN ANY FORM IS WRONG. I'M NOT SAYING I AGREE WITH IT, BUT CHECK YOUR BIBLE. THEY'RE NOT GOING FOR IT. IS MASTURBATION EVIL? ACCORDING TO MY MOTHER, YES. THANK GOD SHE'S DEAD. ♪ SOME HIT JACKPOT, SOME GET LUCKY ♪ ♪ SOME THEY RUN, THEY DON'T WANNA BE FUCKED WITH... ♪ ( screaming ) ♪ SOME THEY RUN, THEY DON'T WANNA BE FUCKED WITH ♪ ♪ SOME HIT JACKPOT, SOME GET LUCKY ♪ ♪ SOME THEY RUN, THEY DON'T WANNA BE FUCKED WITH ♪ ♪ SOME HIT JACKPOT, SOME GET LUCKY ♪ ♪ SOME THEY RUN, THEY DON'T WANNA BE FUCKED WITH ♪ ♪ SOME HIT JACKPOT, SOME GET LUCKY... ♪ SO THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THE PORNO STORE WAS CONCEIVED IN EVIL? WICKEDNESS, YES. AND BUCKY HAD SOMETHING COMING TO HIM BECAUSE HE SATISFIED MY DESIRE TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE FUCKING. VOYEURISM, CORRECT. GENTLEMEN. THOUGH IF PHILLY WAS SENT IN TO EVEN THINGS OUT-- AN EYE FOR AN EYE-- WHY WOULD HE GET HIS HEAD BLOWN OFF BY TOMMY THE COP? THERE ARE VARIOUS LEVELS OF EVIL. SELLING PORNO IN A CRAPPY LOS ANGELES HELLHOLE IS NOT AS EVIL AS ROBBING THAT SAME PLACE AND SHOOTING AN INNOCENT CLERK. THERE'S AN IMBALANCE THERE AND THE FORCES OF NATURE DON'T ALLOW FOR THAT KIND OF THING. SO BECAUSE THE EVIL COMMITTED BY PHILLY FAR OUTWEIGHED THE EVIL COMMITTED BY BUCKY, AN ARBITRATOR HAD TO BE BROUGHT IN. - AN INTERLOPER. - TOMMY THE COP. - PRECISELY. - AND EVIL BEGETS EVIL. BY GEORGE, I THINK YOU'VE GOT IT. ( knocking ) MISS SINCLAIR? MISS SINCLAIR, PLEASE OPEN THE DOOR. MISS SINCLAIR? WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU GOT HERE. I CALLED OVER AN HOUR AGO. MA'AM, I'VE ALREADY KILLED ONE PERSON TODAY. DON'T MAKE ME KILL ANOTHER. ( laughs ) ( mimics laughter ) SO WHAT'S THE DEAL? WELL, I GOT THREE PHONE CALLS-- THREE-- AT 3:00 A.M., ALL NOISE COMPLAINTS. THEY ALL SAID THEY HEARD SCREAMS COMING FROM THIS APARTMENT-- BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAMS. AND YOU WENT TO CHECK IT OUT? NAH, WENT BACK TO BED AND WENT TO SLEEP. I FIGURED IT WAS NOTHING THAT COULDN'T WAIT. OF COURSE. SO AFTER I HAD MY BREAKFAST AND WENT FOR A WALK, I CAME TO INVESTIGATE. AND I KNOCKED AND KNOCKED AND KNOCKED. NO ANSWER. AND HOW DOES SHE SIGN HER CHECKS? - WHAT? - WHAT'S HER FULL NAME? STEPHANIE SINCLAIR. - LIVES ALONE? - FAR AS I KNOW. REPORTS OF SCREAMS, HMM? - MM-HMM. - HMM. THINK SOMETHING HAPPENED? WELL, MA'AM, I HOPE SO. ( both laugh ) - BARETTA! - WHAT THE FUCK? WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? - YOU STEPHANIE SINCLAIR? - WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? SHE'S NOT STEPHANIE SINCLAIR. - AW, FUCK IT. - YOU'RE NOT STEPHANIE SINCLAIR. GEE, IF I'M NOT STEPHANIE SINCLAIR, AND YOU'RE NOT STEPHANIE SINCLAIR AND THIS IS STEPHANIE SINCLAIR'S APARTMENT, THEN WHAT THE FUCK ARE WE ALL DOING HERE? WHAT MADE YOU SO SURE HE WOULDN'T TURN OUR LIGHTS OUT? YOU SAID IT YOURSELF IN THE PORNO STORE-- WASN'T IN HIS NATURE. REALLY, STEPHEN, YOU DON'T GIVE YOURSELF ENOUGH CREDIT. COULD HAVE BEEN WRONG, YOU KNOW? IF THAT COP HAD COME IN TWO SECONDS LATER... ( fires ) IT WAS FATE THEN. FATE'S WHAT PEOPLE BELIEVE IN WHEN IT'S THE LAST CHOICE THEY'VE GOT. OH MY, I DISAGREE. I THINK FATE HAD EVERYTHING TO DO WITH IT. IT WAS FATE THAT WE WERE IN THE STORE TO BEGIN WITH. IT WAS FATE THAT THERE WAS A CLERK BEHIND THE COUNTER AND IT WAS HIS FATE TO DIE TODAY. I BELIEVE IN FATE AS MUCH AS I BELIEVE IN LOVE. I KNOW YOU DO. BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE. YOU DIDN'T KNOW. WELL, I TELL YOU THIS: I GO BY TWO THINGS-- - INTUITION AND ASSUMPTION. - ( siren wails ) INTUITION TELLS ME WHAT TO THINK AND HOW TO ACT. AND ASSUMPTION RULES OUT THE REST. AND YOU'D RISK YOUR LIFE BASED ON THAT LINE OF SHIT? IF WE STOP ASSUMING, WE'LL LOSE SOMETHING IMPORTANT. AN ASSUMPTION IS A LEAP OF FAITH TO BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING WE REALLY WANT TO BELIEVE IS ACTUALLY TRUE. IF WE STOP MAKING ASSUMPTIONS, WE MIGHT JUST LOSE OUR FAITH. I WAS SCARED. AND THAT'S OKAY. - HEY! - HEY, FUCKER. DON'T TOUCH THE FUCKING DICE. HEY, FUCK, IT'S MY DICE, MAN. DON'T-- WELL, DON'T TOUCH-- DON'T FUCKIN' TOUCH-- - WHAT IF-- - Man: FUCKER! --WHAT IF MY INTUITION TELLS ME THAT WE'RE BOTH GONNA DIE SOON? SWEET STEPHEN, EVERYTHING DIES. THE WORLD IS A CIRCLE AND EVERYTHING DIES. ( grunting ) SO HOW'D YOU GET A KEY TO THIS APARTMENT? I WORK AT THE SAME RESTAURANT AS STEPHANIE-- THE BEEHIVE ON MELROSE. SHE LETS ME CRASH SOMETIMES. - HOW'S THE JOB? - IT'S OKAY. SO THEY MAKE US WAITRESSES WEAR THESE BLACK AND YELLOW OUTFITS LIKE WE'RE FUCKING BUMBLEBEES OR SOMETHING. - HA. - IT'S REAL SHORT AND SOME DRUNK ASSHOLE IS ALWAYS TRYING TO PULL ON MY STINGER. EXCEPT FOR THAT, THE JOB IS COOL. WELL, HAVING A COOL JOB IS IMPORTANT. OBVIOUSLY YOU THINK YOU HAVE A PRETTY COOL JOB. I'M A COP. I KNOW-- BARETTA. SO FINISH YOUR STORY. I GOT INTO A FIGHT WITH MY BOYFRIEND TYLER THIS MORNING. HE CAN BE A REAL HAIRY FUCK WHEN HE WANTS TO BE. TYLER SAID HE WANTED TO SEE MORE OF MY FRIENDS, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS GREAT. DIDN'T KNOW HE MEANT NAKED. PRICK. HE SLAPS ME AROUND TOO. ANYWAY, I THOUGHT I'D CRASH HERE ON THE COUCH. STEPHANIE WASN'T HOME SO I TOOK THE BED. ANY SIGN OF TROUBLE WHEN YOU GOT HERE? STRUGGLE? I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING LIKE THAT. IF I WAS TO PAY YOU OR SOMETHING, COULD YOU GIVE TYLER A SPECIAL VISIT WITH YOUR NIGHTSTICK? OR COULD I GET IN TROUBLE FOR EVEN ASKING YOU? HE LIKES TO BEAT ON YOU, HUH? I DON'T KNOW IF HE LIKES IT OR NOT, BUT HE DOES IT. WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT-- HERE. WE'LL FIGURE OUT A CONVENIENT TIME FOR ME TO MEET YOUR FELLA. SO THERE A PICTURE OF STEPHANIE SINCLAIR AROUND HERE ANYWHERE? MEET STEPHANIE SINCLAIR. THANKS, NORMA. - THINK SHE'S OKAY? - I'M SURE SHE'LL TURN UP. IF SHE DOESN'T, YOU GIVE ME A CALL. I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL EVEN IF SHE DOES. YOU KNOW WHOSE THIS IS? I'VE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE. HA. ( applause ) JUST HELP ME OUT HERE A LITTLE BIT, OKAY, KENNY BUDDY? 'CAUSE I'M-- I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MADE YOU TAKE THAT LONG WALK DOWN THAT HALLWAY. Crowd: DENNIS! DENNIS! AND I JUST-- I'M JUST-- I'M JUST NOT GETTING IT! - ( crowd cheers ) - I'M SORRY. I'M HAVING-- HAVING A HARD TIME HERE BECAUSE I JUST KEEP SEEING THOSE-- THOSE TWO LOVELY PEOPLE, THOSE... TWO HUMAN BEINGS. Both: THANKS! YOU DON'T LIKE BUTTER ON YOUR POPCORN, DO YOU, HONEY? - Man: I HATE IT. - Woman: OH GOOD! - HI, SARAH. - MY NAME IS JILL. HELLO, SARAH. I'D LIKE ONE TICKET. ONE TICKET WILL MAKE ME A HAPPY MAN. MY NAME IS JILL. WHAT THE HELL? I'LL TAKE ONE TOO, SARAH. SARAH, I CAN'T TELL YOU THE LAST TIME I'VE BEEN TO THE PICTURES. Stephen: LAST WEEK? NO, THAT WAS A SPECIAL PICTURE. SPECIAL PICTURES DON'T COUNT. - OH. - DO THEY, SARAH? JILL. SEE YOU AT THE CINEMA, SARAH. ( suspenseful music playing ) ( man shouting ) No no! Please don't!

RAN INTO SOME HARD TIMES LATELY, BUT NOW I JUST DO THE CONCESSIONS. AND YET YOU MAINTAIN SUCH A PLEASANT ATTITUDE. KUDOS TO YOU, BARNEY. WELL, I DIDN'T GET AS FAR AS I DID IN THIS LIFE BY BEING AN ASSHOLE. HA HA! I LIKE THAT. I LIKE THAT A LOT. RIGHT, WELL, I'LL HAVE A LARGE TUB OF POPCORN AND-- DO YOU USE BUTTER OR THAT CHEAP GREASY SHIT? THE CHEAP GREASY SHIT. AH, GOOD.

Dentist: Seymour, who's the dentist here, you or me? I'll find that tooth. - IS THIS THE GREASY SHIT? - ABSOLUTELY. NAPKIN? OH. SORRY. Is this Dr. Farb's office? I DIDN'T KNOW JACK NICHOLSON WAS IN THIS. MM-HMM. IT WAS ONE OF HIS FIRST MOVIES. HOW RUDE. MMM. DID YOU KNOW HE AD-LIBBED THE &quot;HERE'S JOHNNY&quot; LINE IN &quot;THE SHINING&quot;? Woman: I DON'T REMEMBER THAT-- THEY ARE SO FUCKING LOUD. SOME PEOPLE HAVE NO MANNERS WHATSOEVER. Man: HE CHOPS UP THE DOOR WITH HIS AXE, STICKS HIS MUG IN AND GOES... - I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. - ...&quot;HERE'S JOHNNY!&quot; Woman: OH, THAT WAS GOOD. DID YOU KNOW HE'S SUCH A LAKERS FAN THE PRODUCERS HAVE TO SCHEDULE HIS SHOOTING DAYS AROUND THE LAKERS' SCHEDULE? DID YOU KNOW I'M TRYING TO WATCH THIS FINE MOVIE AROUND YOUR FUCKING CONVERSATION? SHUT THE FUCK UP. HOME VIDEO FIRST CAME OUT IN THE LATE '70S, RIGHT? IT CHANGED THE MOVIE INDUSTRY FOREVER. CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING IN YOUR HOUSE WATCHING A MOVIE? WHOA. WELL, YOU COULD PUT IT ON PAUSE. YOU COULD TAKE A PISS, FUCK THE WIFE, MAKE A SANDWICH-- ANYTHING YOU WANT TO DO, YEAH. - WHO ARE YOU? - SHH. ( laughs ) HOME VIDEO AND EVENTUALLY DVD ALSO TAUGHT US SOMETHING ELSE: A NEW FORM OF RUDENESS. NOW IF WE CAN WATCH MOVIES IN OUR OWN HOME, THERE'S NOBODY TO OFFEND BUT THE PEOPLE IN THAT HOME. RIGHT? SO NOW WE'VE GOT PEOPLE WATCHING MOVIES, TALKING ALL THE WAY THROUGH IN THEIR FUCKING HOMES, RECONDITIONED TO THINK IT'S OKAY TO DO IT IN PUBLIC, WHICH BOTHERS PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO COULDN'T GIVE A FUCK WHAT YOUR FUCKING OPINION OF THE MOVIE WAS OR HOW GOOD THE BLAH BLAH BLAH WAS LAST WEEK. LOOK, MAN, IF WE DISTURBED YOU... I HAVE A GUN IN MY WAISTBAND. RIGHT NOW. YEAH, I DO. AND IF YOU TWO DON'T SHUT THE FUCK UP, I'M GONNA STICK IT UP BOTH YOUR ASSES AND I'M GONNA PULL THE TRIGGER UNTIL YOUR COLONS SAY &quot;NO MáS.&quot; ENJOY THE SHOW. ( laughs ) MY MOUTH'S DRY. Most people don't like to go to the dentist but I rather enjoy it myself, don't you? WHAT'D YOU SAY TO THEM? OH, I SAID THAT WE WERE TRYING TO ENJOY THE MOVIE AND IF THEY COULD KEEP IT DOWN TO LIKE A DULL ROAR, WE'D APPRECIATE IT. I'd almost rather go to the dentist than... YOU THREATENED THEM, DIDN'T YOU? NO. I DON'T KNOW. I-- Oh goody goody, here it comes. I DON'T THINK SO. I TOLD THEM TO ENJOY THE MOVIE. IS THAT THREATENING? I-- I CAN'T TELL ANYMORE. Dentist: Well, I made a lot of holes and now I've got to fill it up with this here silver stuff. ( slow rock playing ) ( slow instrumentals surge ) SO I'VE BEEN WORKING IN THIS PLACE FOR LESS THAN A WEEK. YOU KNOW, I'M STANDING BY THE WATER COOLER AND I'M TRYING TO GET THIS HOT LITTLE TELEMARKETER TO NOTICE ME. I'M STARING AND I'M STARING. I'VE BEEN HAVING A THING FOR HER FOR A WHILE.

I ONLY HAD THE DAMN THING ONCE, SO... MY PARENTS GOT DIVORCED WHEN I WAS FOUR AND I SAW MY DAD AT THE WEEKENDS, RIGHT? BUT MY DAD DOESN'T WANT TO BOTHER WITH SOME FUCKING DUMB KID. YOU KNOW? HE'S A SINGLE DUDE IN A LOOSE MOOD. SO HE DROPPED ME OFF AT MY GRANDMA'S APARTMENT. NOW MY GRANDMA-- STEPHEN? BREAKFAST IS READY. --SHE WAS A QUEEN. YOU KNOW, A REAL NICE LADY. AND I WAS A REAL FUCKING TV HOUND AT THE TIME. SO I'D ALWAYS FALL ASLEEP IN FRONT OF THE TUBE. Grandma: Stephen? Wake up. Stephen? Breakfast is ready. ( birds chirping ) Eat your fucking breakfast. Now! EAT YOUR FUCKING BREAKFAST. SHE WAS A REAL QUEEN. AND THE THING IS NOW I THINK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME. WHY DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT SO MUCH? WELL, MY GRANDMA WAS THE GREATEST LADY I EVER KNEW. AND SHE WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO CALL ME SWEET. AW, THAT'S... WELL? WHY WOULD I HAVE THAT DREAM? I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT A MIND-READER. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY? MAYBE ONE OF THOSE LITTLE PEARLS OF FUCKING WISDOM YOU'VE BEEN SPITTING OUT ALL DAY. ALL RIGHT. GIVE ME A SECOND. I DON'T BELIEVE IN DREAMS. YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN DREAMS? WHAT KIND OF SHIT IS THAT? THAT-- THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. ( laughs ) WELL, I WISH MY LIFE WERE MORE LIKE A BURT REYNOLDS MOVIE. YOU WANT TO BE OLD AND BALD? NO, I DON'T WISH I WAS BURT REYNOLDS. I WISH MY LIFE WERE MORE LIKE HIS MOVIES. YOU KNOW, LOTS OF HIGH-PITCHED LAUGHS, FAST CARS, BAR-ROOM BRAWLS, FUCKING COWBOY BOOTS. ( imitating laugh ) HA HA HA HA! JUST FUN. THE GUYS WERE GUYS, THE GALS WERE GALS, AND NOTHING REALLY MATTERED. YOU CAN HAVE YOUR DREAM, I GUESS. YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE IN DREAMS. NO, I SAID YOU COULD HAVE YOUR DREAM... I GUESS. AH. Mr. Jack: UH-OH. I'VE SEEN THAT LOOK BEFORE. - YOU COULD PICK ONE OUT, YOU KNOW? - IT'S NOT MY BAG. ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW IS WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR AND BE ABLE TO SAY IT WITHOUT SOUNDING LIKE YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT. BELIEVE ME, YOU'RE A TERRIFIC BULLSHITTER. - HEY. - HEY. BUY ME A DRINK. - BUY YOU A DRINK? - YEAH. - WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? - JESSICA. WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? PAUL SPINOZI. EVERYONE CALLS ME SPO. I LOVE TO EAT ITALIAN. - YOU DO? - YEAH. YUMMY. WOW. WELL, MAYBE-- MAYBE YOU WANT TO LEAVE AND GET A BITE TO EAT THEN? HUH? SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD START. - REALLY? - YEAH. HAVE FUN. - WHAT? - HAVE FUN LEAVING. NOW GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME.

I'M JUST NOT THAT SORT OF CHAP. CAN I GET YOU GUYS ANYTHING ELSE? STRAWBERRIES? HA HA HA HA! YOU KNOW WHAT? TODAY WAS A GREAT DAY. IT WAS A DAY. THE PERFECT MIX OF INTRIGUE, DANGER, TRAGEDY, LOVE, SEX, VIOLENCE AND PLAIN OLD AMERICAN FUN. YOU'RE NOT FROM ENGLAND, YOU KNOW? SOME DAYS GO BY AND YOU DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT BEING ALIVE. IT'S A SHAME, DAYS LIKE THAT. AND THEN THERE ARE OTHER DAYS... WHEN EVERYTHING IS JUST PERFECT. - TODAY WAS ONE OF THOSE DAYS. - YEAH. I REMEMBER THE EXACT MOMENT I REALIZED I EXISTED. - REALLY? - YEAH. GO ON THEN. WHEN I WAS SIX, I NEVER THOUGHT OF MYSELF AS BEING ALIVE. LIFE WAS LIKE A MOVIE-- SOMETHING I WAS WATCHING OUTSIDE OF MYSELF, YOU KNOW? AND IT WAS THIS INSTANTANEOUS THING-- THE REALIZATION THAT... THIS WAS IT. I WAS IN THE THICK OF THINGS. I WAS ALIVE. I WROTE A WILL THAT WEEKEND-- SIX YEARS OLD. BECAUSE... WITH THE REALIZATION THAT I WAS ALIVE CAME THE REALIZATION OF DEATH.

Dennis: I HEAR YOU, MA'AM. OH YES, HERE. KENNY, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING-- YOU NEED TO CHECK YOURSELF, OKAY? 'CAUSE KILLING YOUR PARENTS IS MESSED UP. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'? YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'? ALL RIGHT! - LEAVE THE LAD ALONE. - Man: WHAT? OH, WHO WAS IT SAID THAT? I DID. HUH.

DENNIS. - PLEASED TO MEET YOU. - MY PLEASURE. I'VE NEVER SHAKEN HANDS WITH A MAN THAT CONDONES MURDER AND PITIES MURDERERS. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT'S ME? I AM AMAZINGLY RESOURCEFUL. OY. HA! ALL I'M SAYING IS THE LAD SEEMS TO BE A BIT OUT OF SORTS ALL ALONE ON THE STAGE THERE BY HIMSELF. WELL, PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO JOIN HIM? - Woman: YEAH! - PERHAPS I WOULD. - ( cheering ) - CAN I BRING SOMEONE? BE MY GUEST. I'D LOVE TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS SUBJECT. - AUDIENCE? - All: YEAH! COME ON. ALL RIGHT. TELL 'EM. THAT'S RIGHT. ( chanting ) DENNIS, DENNIS, DENNIS... COME ON, WELCOME. WELCOME. THERE YOU GO. Dennis: Okay, here we are talking to our spontaneous guests straight out of the studio audience. Their names are Mr. Jack and Sweet Stephen. And they subscribe to the belief that people like Kenny Edwards, a convicted murderer, ought to be left alone. All: BOO! NOW MR. JACK, WHY WOULD YOU SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT? WELL, A CRIME IS A CRIME-- WHICH IS TO SAY? MURDERING YOUR PARENTS IS WRONG, CUT AND DRY AND SIMPLE AS PIE. BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT CRIMES. MURDER IS A CRIME. BUT ISN'T EXPLOITING THAT MURDER FOR PERSONAL GAIN, MAYBE SOME HIGHER RATINGS-- ISN'T THAT A CRIME TOO? WELL SEE, I WOULD HARDLY COMPARE RUNNING A TELEVISION SHOW TO-- YOU SEE, I LOOK AT YOU AND I LOOK AT THIS LAD AND I CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE. ( audience jeering ) WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT HIM. LET'S REVIEW WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT YOU. YOU MAKE YOUR LIVING OFF OTHER PEOPLE'S MISERY. DOLLARS IN YOUR POCKET-- THAT'S ALL HE MEANS TO YOU. THESE FOLKS IN THE AUDIENCE-- CHUMP CHANGE. ( all jeering ) WHAT THE FUCK MAKES YOU SO MORAL? NOW MR. JACK, I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU TO WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE. ALL RIGHT? WE'RE LIVE. AND RIGHT NEXT TO MR. JACK IS A MAN WHO CALLS HIMSELF SWEET STEPHEN. NOW DO YOU SHARE YOUR FRIEND'S POINT OF VIEW? WELL... THAT WOMAN THERE-- SHE USED THE WORD &quot;EVIL&quot; TO DESCRIBE HIM, LIKE IT WAS A LIFESTYLE CHOICE. IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CHOOSE LIKE AN ICE-CREAM FLAVOR. IT'S-- IT'S A WARM AND SAFE, INVITING FEELING. AND THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACTING BAD AND BEING BAD. ACTING BAD IS A MOMENT; BEING BAD IS AN ADDICTION. I SHOULD KNOW. SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU-- YOU ENJOY BEING BAD? ARE YOU ADDICTED? BEING BAD IS FUN. - BEING BAD IS FUN? - YEAH. IS THAT YOUR MESSAGE TO THE YOUTH OF AMERICA? - SWEET STEPHEN? - YEAH? ARE YOU EVIL? ISN'T EVERYBODY? I HAVE A QUESTION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT'S TOMMY THE COP! Dennis: OKAY, MIKE HIM. SOMEBODY GET A MIKE ON HIM. ( all chattering ) ALL RIGHT. YOUR QUESTION, SIR? I JUST WANTED TO ASK IF EITHER MR. JACK OR SWEET STEPHEN HERE CONSIDER STABBING A WOMAN AND DISMEMBERING HER CORPSE - AN ACT OF EVIL? - WHAT? AND WHO ARE YOU, SIR? I'M THE ARRESTING OFFICER. I'M THE HERO TO BE NAMED LATER. ( cheering ) WELL, I'D LIKE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, TOMMY. BUT WHAT'S THE POINT IN EXPLAINING SOMETHING YOU'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND? RIGHT, WRONG; GOOD, EVIL; GOD, SATAN. PLEASED TO MEET YOU, TOMMY. WANNA GUESS MY NAME? ( audience screaming ) ( gunshots ) WE SHOULD TALK, YOU AND I. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO TALK ABOUT? THESE STANDOFFS ARE INTERESTING, AREN'T THEY? HOW NEITHER OF US HAS AN ADVANTAGE? WELL, THAT'S NOT EXACTLY TRUE, IS IT? ( laughs ) I'VE GOT A HUGE ADVANTAGE. I'VE GOT A GUN ON YOU. YOU KNOW I'M A GREAT SHOT. WHAT DO YOU HAVE? YOU HAVE A KNIFE AGAINST THE THROAT OF A TABLOID TELEVISION JOURNALIST WHO'S BEEN SLAMMING THE L.A.P.D. FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS FOR BRIBERY, KICKBACKS AND BRUTALITY. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THAT YELLOW BASTARD? HOW DID THIS BECOME ABOUT ME? WILL YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP ONCE AND FOR ALL? WHY DON'T YOU PUT THE KNIFE DOWN, MR. JACK, HUH? OR BETTER YET, MAKE A MOVE FOR RIVERS'S JUGULAR. EITHER WAY, I WIN. THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU, ISN'T IT? PLAYING THE ROLE OF THE POLICEMAN. BUT YOU AND I AREN'T THAT DIFFERENT. WE GET THE SAME URGES. LOOK, HE'S A TRIGGER-HAPPY COP AND YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A PSEUDO-INTELLECTUAL PSYCHOPATH WHOSE REALITIES MEAN NOTHING TO ANYONE BUT YOURSELF AND YOUR DEAD SIDEKICK.
