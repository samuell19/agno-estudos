Stupid bitch! SAME SEX PARENTS Stop! It's just a bit of fun! So... did you...? After all this time. You didn't sleep together... Almost. Almost? We caressed each other. It was great. He said I was beautiful and sweet. Really? He said he loved me! Oh yeah? You think that's stupid. No, but... That Leo's a fast mover. You're jealous! We've been thinking about it for weeks. We wanted to but we didn't dare. Come on... Don't look so sad. Leo's not the only boy around. Here's hoping! You're sweet but if I were a guy... But you're not. We'll invite the best looking guys in school to my birthday party. Great! I'd better be off... I didn't know you liked boys. I assumed you took after your mother. Get lost. You stole him, bitch! I did not, let go! Keep away from Leo or I'll tell everyone What I know. Such as? Don't act dumb, you know. Lie low and I'll keep quiet. - Let me past. - No. Go away. Screw you! Just you wait! Are you OK? Alone? Do's working late, she's on duty. Did you have fun? Have you eaten? Are you in love? Leave me alone. Love's always a bit complicated. - I was the same... - I doubt that. How about some herbal tea? - Come on. - I don't want any. Olympia! What? Coming? You can't stay in there all day. I don't want to come. Suit yourself. We're going out. The male sperm is deposited into the female genital passages during ejaculation. How do you spell that? - Who cares as long as you squirt? - Come on! Act your age. So how did they make Dolly? There's no hanky-panky with a cloned sheep! Yeah, Immaculate Conception! For the time being, reproduction needs a male and a female. Mutual attraction is instinctive. What about test-tube babies? That's not funny. It's a law of nature. Some people go against nature. Like sexual perverts. - Know any, Olympia? - Shut up, Géraldine. Regarding next week's test... Sit down. - But that was the bell. - I said sit down. Next week there's a test on mammalian sexual reproduction. Poor girl. Shame about her mother. Don't you like her mother, then? As long as her mother doesn't like me! Look at that slut gazing at me. Scared, huh? Well, it's too late. Stop it. We all know about your mother. She should be burned at the stake. Shut up! You bitch! Knock it off! Go on, then! - Leave me alone. - What have I done? Stay away from me! Say that again. Have you forgotten Saturday? It's all I've thought about. Watch it, Leo, her mother's a filthy dyke. Shit! What's going on? Now just calm down! It's nothing. Go to the sick room. Olympia, in my office! You never usually come to see me. You're put out. Not at all. I'm delighted to see you. So, What's going on? Still lovesick? - I don't want to talk about that. - Fine. I'm not here to confide in you. More the opposite. Did you and dad ever live together? - Well, no... - You were never in love. In love, no. You must have made love. Look... We did What we had to to have you. I already explained... But some things you won't talk about. Like your love life. - Not here, not now. - To hell With them! It's never the right time or place. I'd like to know...! I respect your father very much but we were never madly in love. No point pretending otherwise. Silence is like a lie. Look, darling, we'll talk about it later. See What you're like? I'm not going back to that crappy school. What's the problem? You're hiding something. That's a good one! You're the one with a secret life. I don't hide anything. Liar! I've always been honest. Not always. Some things are hard to talk about. Well, everyone else is talking about it! And not in glowing terms, believe me! Everyone knows about you and Do. #It's Leo,# #I wanted to talk to Olympia. #Anyway, thanks. 'Bye... Coming... - Me and Leo were looking for you. - I've finished with him. Are you crazy? I'm going to Paris to live with my dad. I'm sick of that school. So I lose my best friend and have to face those stupid bitches alone? Is it true What Géraldine said about your mother? Are you high? Géraldine's a bitch but you're stupid. Didn't you get it? You never noticed anything weird? Well, now you know. Like everyone else. So if you don't like it... Wait! Hi, girls. Here... this is from Leo. I'm glad I ran into you. Isn't your cousin Dominique a nurse? Does she do homecare? My father's sick and I live just opposite. - She only works at the hospital. - Pity. Time to eat. - We've called you 3 times. - I'm not hungry. Being a secret part of your life is hard for me too. It can't go on forever. I'll talk to her. This isn't the right moment. In 2 years of living together it's never been the right time. Do got you some tickets for the show. How does Saturday sound? - I hear it's great. - I'm going to Dad's this weekend. Since when? Some things in life aren't planned. Do you mind my going to Paris? I mind your talking to me like this. Your sulking at me, being so tense. I have my reasons. Undoubtedly. - Can we talk about it? - No. You're the last person I can talk about it to. I'm fed up with living here, and with both of you. Can't you see I'm suffocating? - I'm repressing it. - Repressing What? Your daughter knows about your life, about us. She just wants too hear it from you. She's fed up With having to work out everything for herself. I can't do it. Marion! What are you doing? - Can you do me favor? - You look lovely! Can you do this favor? - Tell Leo to go to the bridge. - You're skipping class? Never you mind. Your make-up's lovely. Hurry! - Where'd you get the skirt? - Go! Hi. You OK? Leo... do you really love me? Yes, I love you. I love your eyes... your mouth... your hair... And your laugh too. Don't I scare you after What you've heard about me? To hell with What people say. I loved you the moment I saw you. It was raining. You were late, remember? I'd just changed address. Again! We'd already sat down. There you were, standing on the platform. Bolt upright in front of the teacher. In your red coat, dripping wet. You were cute. Really cute. Lucky I changed. Changed... To me, you're not like the others. Not like the others. Yes, I am. You're not. Why aren't I like the others? You're unique. Different. Well, you're not. You're just as stupid as the rest. Why am I different? Because my dad's gay and my mom's a lesbian? I only care about you. I don't give a damn about your parents! Well, I do. Olympia! Bet you cause quite a stir on your bike in that skirt. Did you hurt yourself? I'm bleeding. It isn't your day. Do dropped by. Her Wing mirror was broken. But pretty girls are always welcome here... You think Do's pretty? She's not bad. I just meant... She's not my type but... What's so funny? Nothing. Looks like you're tire's had it. It'll cost you. I'm broke. I'll come back later. Hey, wait! I'll buy you a drink. You can't say no... I'm on my break, boss! I know a nice bar. Space Café! Really! Do you know it? It's a cool place. You're cramping my style! Not bad! Let me try on my own. You're a champion. You know... you're not usually so nice to me. Forget it. Ever notice anything funny about Do? Like What? Is there anything to notice? OK, she and your mother are a bit... They're dykes. How did you know? You can just tell. Not that I mind. I had a friend Who turned gay. I don't care. As long as he doesn't poke me! Hey... Don't tell me you're one too. Are you crazy? Prove it. DYKES Gone off motorbikes? Have fun. Give Antoine my love. How's it going? Still pleased with it? Great. But if you know of any 5003 going... Well, we get all sorts in here. So I see. 2503 have plenty of power. - But I fancy... - Something faster? Can we go now? I'll miss the train. Fill her up. What are you doing? Olympia! Please... I'll take the bus. I know you've got worries but Why take it out on me? Saying nothing isn't the answer. You resent our not helping you but you say nothing. I didn't start it. You're right. But listen, I really like you a lot. I want you and Martine to communicate. Then we can get back to having fun. I'm not a little girl any more. You haven't been for a While. And you're not perfect. Fortunately! But we can easily sort all that out. - I get fed up too. - I'm fed up all the time. Dad! Let's go... So What's wrong? - I went out with a guy named Leo. - "Went out"? Meaning? Went out. Do I need to spell it out? The problem's Géraldine. You know, that slut Who thinks she's Demi Moore. I hate her, she's a real bitch! How can I have been so dumb? Anyway... I should've listened to Marion. What was I saying? She went crazy With jealousy. Know What the bitch did? Who, Marion? No, Géraldine! I should've killed her. I didn't for Leo's sake. He was already freaked out. Imagine if I'd beaten her up! Shall I tell you What she did? She said Mom was a sexual pervert. And put graffiti in the toilets. Now everyone hates me. Good thing she doesn't know you're gay! So? Just tell her there's nothing wrong with it. Some of the world's greatest men have been gay. Churchill, Plato, Verlaine... Leonard da Vinci... Shit! It's burnt. To a cinder. This Geraldine's a snake. Defend yourself. Stand up to her. "Fag" is the worst insult. Even worse than asshole, jerk or mental case. It's just the worst. Apart from "dyke". Is something burning? Christophe... this is my daughter Olympia. You OK? Something is burning... Looking for Olympia? She's gone. - I know. - No, you don't. I can give her a message. I'll do it myself. Look, she's done with you. She came for a spin with me. Know What I mean? I'm looking for Olympia. She's not here. #Who is it? Where can I find her? -# It's urgent. #- She's at her dad's. #Who are you? For Gay Pride, he made himself a leopardskin jumpsuit with a tail! A tail in front or behind? Careful, you'll shook my father. Your father isn't easily shocked. Excuse me a moment... How long have you known Dad? About a year. No, only 11 months! Why haven't I met you? Well, I'm very shy. Drinks all round. I sign the contract next week! Get some sleep, it's late. We have an early start tomorrow. Tell me about Christophe. What about him? How did you meet? How did we meet? On a site. That's original! I couldn't resist his bulging muscles. Dad... I like it here. That's all we need! But it's true. Everything's easy with you. Your life, your friends... And Christophe. I know Where I am. - It's Martine. - I'm asleep! She's waging war on me. Naturally. You have to make peace. You couldn't talk to your mother, now it's the same for Olympia. You're complicating matters. Don't be afraid. Whenever I speak, it's a disaster. It's for your daughter's well-being. You slept round the clock. Sleep well? Christophe's not here? No, he's at a family lunch. We could take in a movie. If you don't mind, I'll take you back early. I've got a meeting tomorrow morning. We'll tell Martine... What's wrong? Are you crazy? Skip the movie! Don't you have any homework? None. Really? How did this term go? Isn't the staff meeting coming up? I know a weekend isn't very long. I'm working a lot right now. But I'll take a break soon and we'll spend time together. Meanwhile, your life is with your mother and Do. Martine's wonderful. She loves you more than anything. The mother/daughter thing is tricky. Not tricky, just crap. Why don't you tell her What's going on? - With Leo? She wouldn't get it. - Not Leo. The insults. I only care about Leo. Your mother can help you With the other things. She can't, she's too ashamed. - I know Martine. - No you don't! You never lived with her! Is that a reproach? Look, maybe... she's unsure how to go about it. It's because of her I get screwed and frighten guys off. Life in that apartment is hell. She and Do just want me out. Don't be silly. That's unfair! Dad, I want to live with you. I'm hungry. Isn't it nice? You can't be hungry. Want anything else? I don't know. A dessert. Shit! We forgot to call your mother. I'll do it. Was she there? So What do we do? You wanted dessert. Let's get out of here. OK, I'm coming... Shall I come up? No point. You're tired and it's along drive back. I'll give you a wave. A dry dressing. No damage to the tendon. Close call. She's fine but I'll keep her in for observation. Put her in 17. We'll give her a pain killer. How did it happen? I'm not sure. "I'm not sure." I'm sick of your bullshit! Come on, tell me What's going on. I don't get it. It's my fault. You and your damn guilt trip! Spare me the moaning, just explain. She interrupted our lovemaking. You weren't due till tomorrow. But she called to tell you. No, never! Oh, I see. Olympia's mad at you. We need to have a chat about it. Come on, let's go to your place. I don't want to discuss it now. What happened to you? I left loads of messages. Are you OK? Here... I can't come. If you change your mind... I need to see you after class. Quiet, please. My name's Paul Dumont, your new literature teacher for a few weeks. To get to know you better... "Who am I?" You have 2 hours... Christ, you wrote a Whole book! Self-ignorance. I had a lot to say. Anything to say to me? I have a question. - Who's this guy? - What guy? That asshole of a mechanic! You're jealous? - How did you find out? - I just did. It freaked me out. I don't care. Anyway, he's nothing. You don't care about who? I don't like anyone. Forget about me. So it's over? It's OK. We'll remove the stitches tomorrow. That hurts. Let me do it. If I don't do it, another nurse will. The cut needs proper dressing I bought all your favorites. So, is it healing? Tell your girlfriend not to touch me. She might grope me. Your kid's totally crazy! Who do you think you are? A fool Who's had enough. Deal With her yourself! She says silly things but don't hit her. I was wrong to. It should've come from you. Yeah, right. Go on, leave us alone! I hate the filthy dyke. Make her go. If she stays I'm going back to Dad's. Wait, Do, please. It's her or me. If I get my hands on the culprit... You'll do What? Go on, tell me. You look better in a skirt. Shall I take you for a spin? This is 3 Rolls Royce. Beats your mother-in-law's 250 hands down. She's not my mother-in-law. Climb on, we'll go to a party. No thanks, I'm expected. Is it OK now? Some weird guy was looking for you. Hanging around outside your place. Is he sniffing round you? Is that it? Have you been crying? Was she that important to you? Then you're lovesick. Sorry. How was I supposed to know? You should have told me. Are you mad at me? Say something for God's sake! Like What? That I'm unhappy? That Do's the woman of my life? That I'm lost Without her? Well, now you know! - What's up? - I thought you'd gone. There's trust for you! I promised you I wouldn't. - Come in. - You come out. Mom won't let me. Then don't tell her. Come on! He said he wouldn't come. Serves her right! It's cool of you to come. Thanks. I'm difficult at the moment but I'll get over it. We had this teacher in my final year. She was young. Not much older than us. She was exciting. She'd leave her office to come and be with us. She had this way of telling you things. We were under her spell. One day she said, "This may shock you but... "it doesn't matter Who you love "as long your love is true." It changed my life. And she was beautiful. Very beautiful. - She had lovely skin... - OK, I get it. And? My mother was delighted. I had excellent grades in philosophy, she was delighted With my reports. Mom even invited her round for dinner to thank her for her "good influence". What about Grandad? He never had a say in such matters. Is that Why they got divorced? They never divorced. When you were born, Grandad caved. He came to the maternity ward. We made up after 10 years. But he knew there was no going back for your grandmother. So he made up that story for you. To simplify matters. Then she still lives with Grandad. - But she refuses to see me. - No, she's rejecting me. When she realized I was mad about this woman, that I had a romance with a female, I ceased to exist for her. Since then, she's ceased to exist for me. Typical. He's only doing it to piss you off. Come on, we'll be in trouble. You go on ahead. Tristan, 6 out of 20. The bit about having a double baffled me. Elodie, 11 out of 20. Could be bolder. Olympia. 19 out of 20. Splendid. The lucidity and sincerity in the writing is deeply moving. A pleasure to read. Stéphane. 14 out of 20. I've ruined everything. Don't say that. Nobody loves me. Well, I do. I adore you. How could anyone not love you? You've got it all. Beautiful... intelligent... And funny, when you want to be. Your hair's soft. You're the ideal girl. You know What? I Wish I were you. I knew it! Can I sleep with you? Dad? Still got nothing to tell me? #This is Antoine's. Please leave a# message... - Moving out? - It's Christophe's gear. He's moving in for a While. #Olympia? Pick up the phone. #It's midnight, I'm very worried. #Antoine, tell her. #I know What's happened. Marion's mother called me. What? It doesn't matter, darling. It's no crime to kiss a girl. It matters to me. What matters? She kissed a girl. 30 What? You're sure homosexuality isn't hereditary? Maybe you passed it on to me. If heterosexuality isn't, Why would homosexuality be? He's got a fat ass. Pity, he's cute. What about him? Oh no. He's a macho poseur. Can't stand macho-types. Fancy anything? Can't say I do. He's gorgeous. Look! You're eyeing up all these guys. Is it over with Leo? He's moved on. And you accept that? You get over it. Anyway, he was too old for me. We# have# to punish her! Lateness, aggressive behavior, awful marks... 19 for her essay. She's an excellent pupil. Precisely! Her attitude is intolerable. A few days' suspension would be... Disastrous! Olympia's going through a bad patch. She needs help, not suspensions! She's suspending herself With her antisocial behavior. Not to say abnormal! The kid has problems, I've asked the other pupils... Well, maybe the pupils have something to say. She is weird. She spurns help. Except from classmates Who are fatally attracted to her! I dare not repeat the things I've heard. A school cannot tolerate such behavior! It's outrageous! What's a snake like you doing here anyway? Mind your manners! He's right! We're here to defend pupils, not knock them. She's a good girl, she harms nobody. Whereas you're a bitch! Leo, calm down! That goes for everyone. I think we need a 15-minute break to clear our heads... So, did I get a suspension? The math teacher had a go... Come to see how you're doing? They spent 2 hours on you. Apart from that other fag, they're all against you. Poor Marion! Victim of sexual harassment. Rather her than me. Knock it off! You talk out of your ass! They all defended her. They're not the problem... Come on! Quiet, please. Today, we'll carry on with reproduction. Starting with chromosomes. First, I'll bring you up to date on the staff meeting. Overall, your results are satisfying. But some individual cases do present problems. Olympia, Where are you going? That's enough. Silence! Are you crazy? What's wrong with you? Who wrote this? Before we go any further, I want to know who wrote this note. It's intolerable! This intrigue has gone on long enough. You go too far. Géraldine. I thought you were an example to your classmates. You want to die? I want to be left alone. Come on... I'll buy you a drink. This isn't about the staff meeting. Something happened this morning. What's going on now? I know it's none of my business but you know What kids are like. It's appalling. - Where is she? - We don't know. She vanished this morning. I'm on my way. Sorry, I have to go. 30 soon? What's happened? We'll have to do this another time. My daughter's in trouble. Not serious, I hope? Daughter? I thought he was... So? Great! Let's go for a ride! Hello, is Olympia here? Are you Leo? Any news? No, I've called everyone. Nobody's seen her. Not since she left school on her bike. Light grey. I'm on my way. - Will you stay here? - OK. If Olympia comes home, keep her here. We get more suicides in Winter than summer. Especially teenagers. My daughter's father. I was telling your Wife, we found her bike near the bridge. We've searched as far as the lock and found nothing. You're very tactful. Thanks! Teenagers are so impulsive. Some of them jump. OK, thanks. Call us if you hear anything. She's just disappeared. I was way off the mark. She's been playing truant. I didn't realize the stick she was getting. If anything's happened to her... Look. "Lesbian plus fag equals Olympia the dyke." Did you anticipate this? We should never have had her. I can't bear to hear you talking such crap. We both wanted her. We both knew What to expect. This doesn't make us wrong. It does. It was foolhardy and selfish. All parents have trouble with teenagers. Just like us. Hi. Isn't Martine here? Did you find her? - Who? - Olympia's gone missing. Missing? Bet it's that mechanic... Olympia's great. She has guts. She won't be cowed by a few insults. Pull over... What? - Leave me alone! - What's the matter? I'm fed up with your preaching, of listening to you! It's easy for you! You live in a cool part of Paris, you have a good job. You ride into town to save your daughter. I live here! Among people Who Whisper and avoid eye contact. I'm doing my best! Ever wondered Why I keep changing address? Hi, guys. This is Olympia. Hi. I hear you like bikes. Especially the vibrations, right? Wanna try mine? She's hot! Aren't you? We aren't going to eat you. Less cocky now, aren't you? Well? You want to screw me, right? Go ahead! We're not here to chat, are we? Go on, then. What? Do I disgust you? Don't I turn you on? What are you waiting for? Come on... Are you chicken? Come on. - We're not gonna beg. - Knock it off! No one touches her, OK? Come on, What are you waiting for? Let's split... I'm sorry. Olympia's not a kid any more. You were young once, you had parent problems. Everyone does. I'll leave you to your family. See you tomorrow, OK? - Don't ever do that again. - Sorry. I don't know What got into me. I thought I was protecting you. Far from it. I love you. Stay with us. I'd like to.. but... I'd really like you to. It's like waking up from a nightmare. I've been such an idiot. Don't say that. - About the other day... - Forget it. You're my best friend. Did you see how Leo tore into Géraldine? She didn't know Where to turn! I invited her to the party. Stupid bitch won't dare come. - You OK? - Give us a hand... I'll be right back... - Fancy a dance? - Yeah, OK. Leo... What? I love you.
