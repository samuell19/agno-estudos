Stop. Stop! Hey, Violet. [breathing shakily] ["The Mountaintop" by PaintSmooke playing] [indistinct chattering] Hey. Do you have plans this weekend? My parents are gonna be out of town. I was thinking about having a party or something. Violet? You OK? [man] How's everything going? "Everything" is a really big word. - Let's start with... - [boy] Do you mean physically? Emotionally? Those both could encompass "everything." Or is "everything" encompassed by both things? Are you feeling overwhelmed by anything? If "everything" is encompassed by both things, are they a part of our reality, or are they somewhere else? This isn't funny, Theodore. Finch. I need you to take these meetings seriously. I get it. OK, do you "get" that you're on probation, and in danger of not graduating? You've already missed two weeks of school this year. Yeah, um... - my grandma... - Stop one second. I just wanna clarify real quickly. Is this the grandma who's died four times over the past three years? Five times, actually. This is the fifth. She's our miracle. I really wanna help you, but you've gotta take this seriously. I mean, you agreed to these terms, these weekly counseling sessions, maintaining a B-average, extracurricular participation. And I am loving pottery. Come on, man. Look, I get it. If I screw anything up, I'm out. We're not askin' a lot of you, Finch. You just need to show up. [girl] My parents are pissed because I missed early admissions, but it's not like that matters, anyway. I mean, I know I'm gonna get in. Did you apply anywhere yet? - Hey. - Hi. So, you going to Amanda's party? [boy] It'll be fun. So I've heard. It couldn't hurt to have a little fun, right? Yo, do you think it'd be weird if I named my kid after a famous person? Like, if I named him Danny DeVito Donahue, do you... do you think he'd be mad about it? Is "DeVito" the middle name? Yeah. Follow-up question: how high are you right now? [giggling] On the scale, I'd probably say very... this way. - [Finch] On the scale... - [boy] Yeah? What are you looking at? Just admiring the social norms of teenage angst. - Are you looking at Violet Markey? - Yep. Her, um... her sister died, right? Yeah, dude. Hm. Why ask about her all of a sudden? I'm intrigued. A guy can't be intrigued? Well, a guy can be intrigued. You being intrigued is weird. - [boy] Definitely weird. - No, I don't think it's weird. I wouldn't say "weird." Wait, if you don't think you're weird, well... - Yeah, that's true. Very true. - [boy] She has a point. [tires screech] - [woman] Your guidance counselor called. - Embryo? [woman] What? [Finch chuckles] His name's Embry. I call him Embryo. It's the little things, Kate. Did you do something I should be worried about? I'm genuinely offended by that supposition. - Finch. - No. It's fine. I'll deal with it. - [Kate] I hate when you say that. - Why? Because what you really mean is that I'm gonna have to deal with it. Did you cut class again? No! For fuck's sake, just go hang out with Tina or whatever it is you do. I'm fine. OK. I'm gonna be home late. There's food in the fridge. - Mm-hmm. - Real food, Finch. Where's Mom? She had to go to Chicago for business. Remember? - Oh, yeah, right. Cool. - Love you. [Finch] Hey. - Love you. - Love you. [Kate] No more cheese, Finch! I'm gonna get the dessert.

To wander them, if you will. For your class project, you must report on two or more wonders of Indiana. You will write about them, explain their significance to you and to Indiana, and why you chose to visit them. I want you to take time on this assignment. Be thoughtful. [students laughing] [teacher] OK. What just happened? That was so weird. - What? - [teacher] All right, settle. Violet, are you OK? All right, let's take our seats. Let's focus up. If you're done, Mr. Finch? Yes, I am done, and can I just say you are doing a fine job teaching this class. My young brain is plump with knowledge. - [teacher] Thank you, Mr. Finch. - You're welcome. [teacher] As I was saying, you'll be taking photos, doing some drawings, capturing detail. You will be doing this in teams of two. Can we choose our partners? Yes, Mr. Finch. Hey. So, um... do you think that there's such a thing as a perfect day? I'm the last person you should be asking. [microwave pings] [Violet] For my geography class, this teacher wants us to do this project with a partner, and I just don't wanna do it. Well, did you ask for an alternate project? Yeah, he just... he wouldn't listen. Well, maybe it's time to get back out there. That's the same thing he said. I know it's hard. - But you just don't go out anymore. - That's not true. When's the last time you hung out with your friends? I think it would be really good if you'd spend some time with them. So, if I hung out with my friends, you'd get me outta this assignment?

Why does he keep doing this? I don't know. Have him call me when you hear from him, OK? Yeah. - [Kate] Bye. - Bye. [footsteps receding] [Amanda] I heard you beat the shit outta Roamer. Why do you keep doing stuff like that? Aren't you tired of people talking about you all the time? People are always gonna talk. It's their specialty. Are you OK? I don't know. I feel like I keep messing things up, and I'm not sure I know how to not do that. Does this work? It's better than the alternative. [knocking on door] [Kate] Your girlfriend's pretty worried about you. She's been at the house all afternoon. What's going on? I don't... really remember... Dad that well. And everything I do... remember is... is bad. Are there any... good memories you have of him? [Kate sighs] Well, the fact that he would beat the shit out of us kind of negated all the good times. But why was he like that? Was he like that because of us? Was he... like that because of Mom? He was like that because he was a shitty person. [Finch] There has to be a reason, though. Because if there's a reason, then he could get better. Something or... someone could make him better, right? I don't know. Who cares? Dude, he's someone else's problem. Why are you asking me about Dad? What's going on, Finch? Come on. You can talk to me, man. Nothing, Kate. Sorry. Nothing. I'm good. Are you sure? Because I have to open the bar, - but I can find someone to cover me. - I'm good. [chuckles] You know I love you, right, Theo? I know. [door opens] [footsteps approaching] You scared me. What is all of this? [Finch] I'm trying to focus. [Violet] Focus on what? On staying awake. I don't understand what that means. Sometimes I... go blank. I... get into these dark moods. I think too fast to keep track of anything, and then it's like... all my thoughts are gone at once. And sometimes, if I put 'em up there, I can... focus and slow down, but... I can't right now. I can't. OK. [Finch] And this usually works. Maybe there's too much clutter. I can fix it. I just... I just need time to figure this out. - [Violet] I'm trying to help you. - I don't need your help! This is on me! This isn't about you! You need to tell me what's wrong. You don't get it. [sobbing] You're right. I don't get it. Don't you know, Violet? I'm "The Freak." I'm fucked up! I need you to leave. Go! [footsteps receding] [door opens] [door closes] [birds chirping] [indistinct chattering] [brakes squeak] [ringing tone] [voicemail] Hey, it's Finch. Leave a message. - [Violet sobbing] - [voicemail beeps] Hey, Finch. Um... [sobs] I'm sorry. I'm just sorry that I pushed. And... I... just need you to come back. I just really need you to come back, OK? [breathing heavily] Hey, kiddo. Hey. Dad? Yeah? On Eleanor's birthday... I... I wasn't really thinking. I found myself at the bridge. I was standing on a ledge. That's how I met Finch. He found me there. He saved me. You... you weren't gonna... I'm OK. I was... confused. I was sad. I'm OK. I'm better now. Wow. Well, I'm glad Finch was there. Me too. [Violet] I just wish I knew where he was. Well... you two have been a lot of places. Is there any place else he might go? [buckles seat belt] [exhales slowly] [engine starts] [adjusts gear] [breathing shakily] [panicked breathing] Finch! [panicked breathing] Finch! Finch. [panicked breathing] [Violet sobbing] Marco! [somber instrumental music playing] [strained sobbing] [man] On behalf of Finch's family, I wanna thank you all for being here today. We've gathered to celebrate and to honor the memory of one who will be incredibly missed because he has been so dearly loved. The events of these past few days... [mournful instrumental music playing] [indistinct reading] I'm gonna say bye. OK, we'll wait for you. [girl] Hey. I should've been there. I miss him. Just so fucked. [Violet] I had no idea. Sorry that I wasn't there for you. It's OK. I didn't know how to tell you. I would miss you. Yeah, I know you would. [chuckles] [mournful instrumental music playing] [thunder rumbling] [uplifting instrumental music playing] [Violet] "Travelers' Prayer Chapel, created as a sanctuary for the weary travelers to stop and rest along their way. It was built in memoriam to those who have lost their lives in auto accidents... and as a place for healing. We remember those who are no longer here, who were taken from us too soon, and who we will always keep in our hearts." [chuckles lightly] [sad chuckle] [Violet] I used to be worried about everything. Things that seemed meaningful... were actually meaningless. I worried about life. I worried about what would happen if I let myself feel again. I thought I didn't deserve to. Then... without really knowing... I changed. I wasn't worried about what would happen if I lived. I was worried about what would happen if I didn't. What I would miss. I worried about not remembering. Not remembering all of the moments... all of the places... [chuckles] ...and that's because of Finch. Because he taught me to wander. [breathes shakily] [Violet] He taught me that you don't have to climb a mountain to stand on top of the world. That even the ugliest of places can be beautiful, as long as you take the time to look. That it's OK to get lost... as long as you find your way back. But in learning all of that, I missed seeing something more important... seeing Finch. I missed that he was in pain. I missed that he was teaching me all along how to move on. Finch was a dreamer. He dreamt while he was awake. He dreamt of all the beauty in the world, and he made it come to life. Finch taught me that there's beauty in the most unexpected of places. And that there are bright places, even in dark times. And that if there isn't... you can be that bright place... with infinite capacities.
