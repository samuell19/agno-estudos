Where's Dylan? - It takes girls longer to get dressed. - Yeah he needs to put on his makeup. (boys laughing) - Boys, be nice. - You just take him back, he don't fit in. - Elijah, stop it! - He doesn't, he's gay. - Michael you don't even know what gay means. Now shut up before I send you all back. - Where? - [Mom] To the home, now hush. Dylan, Dylan baby, Dylan baby. (gentle piano music) (knocking) Oh Dylan. - Now they're gonna make fun of me and say I look like a girl. I hate my voice. - Oh baby, you can't spend your whole life afraid of what other people are gonna say. How many times do I have to tell you that, huh? Baby, your voice is a blessing from God. Now you wanna know something else? - What? - I love your voice the best. - Really? - (chuckles) Yep. Now let's go take this picture and get you on a bus. - [Dylan] Okay. - Okay, gimme a hug. (laughing) You are so silly. (laughing) Go downstairs. (sighs) (camera clicking) (gentle piano music) David, your dinner's ready, baby. - Mama, how did you deal with this? - (exasperated sigh) I ask myself that same question. (laughing) Come on, let's eat. - [David] Well I'm surprised I'm the only one here. - Well Dylan wanted to come, but he had a show in London. Xavier got a new job and he needs the holiday pay and well, Elijah was deployed again. Mm, I worry about my baby Elijah, Mm, off fighting that white man's war. - Well, better that he be serving the country than serving time. - Amen. - What about Michael? - Malachi is at Emani's family. - (coughing) Malachi? - David-- - You mean Michael? Look, I'm not calling that man Malachi just because he decided to marry a woman who turned him Muslim, it doesn't mean you gotta change your name for all that. - David, you have to respect the man's wishes. - Respect the man's wishes? How about he respect the woman who adopted him and come home for the holiday that he can actually celebrate? - We talk. - No, I mean, when's the last time you actually seen him? - The wedding. - Exactly, the wedding and that was almost a year ago. - But we talk though, okay? And everybody's got their own careers and families and I get that. - Yeah right, whatever. They should still be here. I mean you are our family. Who else is gonna sacrifice their life adopting five boys? Ma, why you ain't doing your cooking show no more? - (clears throat) How's that fellowship program? - Come on, ma. - David-- - Don't change the subject. - David, how was your fellowship-- - Ma. - Look, I've been busy doing other things, okay? Okay? Now how's your fellowship program? (sighs) - It's almost over. It's okay. The trial didn't go so well. - Mm. - I mean, I'll just start going to medical school where I'll be actually saving lives. - What about Megan? How's she doing? - We broke up. Which is probably the reason why she's not here. - Oh Lord. What was the fight about this time? - (sighs) well um, she wants to leave Atlanta. - Mm? - She wants to go to a hospital in Seattle. She's been keeping up with this general surgeon named Miranda Bailey, wants to work for her diabetes trial. - So what's wrong with Seattle? - Seattle? - Yeah. - (laughing) Come on, ma, ain't no black people in Seattle. (laughs) Like, come on, you know that. - David, why are you so afraid to leave me, huh? You went to Morehouse to stay close. You went to Emery to stay close. I think you should leave Georgia for a while. It'll be good for you. And you love that girl. (laughs sarcastically) There was one time I thought you loved her more than medicine. And I think it'll be good for you to go out there and support her. And there's nothing keeping you here but me. - (laughs) What? I have more here. - [Angel] Oh really? - Yeah really. - [Angel] Like what? - (sighs) I got friends. - (laughing) What friends? - I got friends. - (laughing) oh stop lying. - I do. - Oh, I can always tell when you are lying. - I'm not lying. Plus, I think I found someone. - Oh. You got you another girl. - Oh, no. No, not exactly. Um-- - Wait a minute. (sighs) - No, don't, don't give me that look, okay? - Okay. - Dylan is the gay son. I'm not your gay son (laughs) okay? That has nothing to do with this. It's not that. (laughs) Um, no, I uh, think I may have came across some new information about finding my birth mom. - Oh. Oh. - Yeah, um, but I'm just curious, okay? - Okay. - I mean, being involved with this trial, I just learned how this disease is linked to genetics and everybody else is talking about their family history and then they look at me and I don't know how to react. I don't know anything about my genetics. I don't know if my mom was a diabetic. I don't know if she's ever had a tumor. I mean all of these questions, you know? - Okay, so you find out. Then how will that help you, hm? - I don't know. Maybe it'll tell me how I'll die or something. You know? - (laughing) Oh, now that is a pile of bull. - I mean, come on, I mean listen, if I find out who she is, maybe I can find out who my dad is. Maybe I can find out if my hairline is gonna be receding before 30. I mean, you just never really know, come on. - (laughing) You are funny. Mm. - Doesn't mean I'm replacing your or anything, okay? If that's what you're thinking, okay? - Well I know that. Ain't no replacing me, baby. (laughs) 'Cause she ain't got nothing on me, you hear? (laughs) But you do that if that's what you wanna do, but you be careful. And if you need me to help you, just let me know. - I will. I promise you, I will. - Oh, I am so glad to see you. - Oh gosh. (laughing) I'm glad to see you too, mom. - Eat up. - Okay. Here I go. So, you're turning the big 50 this year. - Yeah, 50. (foil rattling) - Are you not excited? - Yeah. (laughs) Yeah, I am. - Okay, so what's the plan, ma? - Well it's Christmas, so it's gonna be the usual, toy drive and dinner at the boy's home. Why? - You're turning 50. It's time to, you know, it's time to turn the fuck up! - Oh, watch your mouth, boy. - What? (laughing) Okay, okay, I'm sorry, but I mean, we are. Look, I'm running to the bathroom, once I get back, we're planning the biggest, most spectacular birthday party ever, okay? My mom's turning 50. (claps) I don't know what you thought this was. (laughs) - Woo, um, use the one upstairs, the one in the hallway is broken, baby. - [David] All right. (coughing) (gasping) (gasping) (coughs) (clears throat) (labored breathing) (gentle piano music) (water trickling) - Did you wash your hands? (water trickling) - How long has it been back? - (clears throat) What baby? (bottle slaps counter) - The cancer. - David-- - How long, ma? - Not too long. - How far along are you in this treatment? - I don't, I don't know. (exhales) I don't know. (sniff) I don't know when it came back. They caught it a few weeks ago in my blood work, so. - Is this why you haven't been doing your show? - Yeah. I've just been so tired. (coughing) - So what did they say? You gotta do chemo again? (sighs) - It's bad this time, David. - How bad, ma? - It's everywhere. It's in my blood. It's in my bones. (exhales) It's just spreading too fast. (slaps legs) - What's next? - No, I can't go through that again, baby. - Oh man, that's the only option, mom, we-- - No. No, it's not the only option. - So what you gonna do, huh? What are you gonna do? Just gonna sit here and die? - Baby, sometimes you just gotta know when it's time. - What do you mean when it's time? Man, you're 49 years old, dammit! - Don't you curse me. Now you don't know how it felt to watch my boys just fall apart because y'all didn't know how to function without me. (crying) Baby, the pain that this cancer has caused your hearts is way worse than the pain that it's made me feel. No, and no matter what, it's gonna keep coming back. That girl down at the church has has had cancer seven times in 15 years. Oh God, I just, I just don't wanna spend the rest of my life fighting something that is not curable. (water trickling) - So how long did they give you, huh? - (crying) Six weeks. Six beautiful weeks. (sighs) - When were you gonna tell me? - I don't know. - (slams counter) You don't know? - Yes, I don't 'cause I don't know how to pick up the damn phone and tell the people that I love that I am dying. How do you do that, huh? How do you break everyone's heart, huh? You tell me the words. Mmhmm. It is better like this. David this is my wish. This is my last wish. I just wanna enjoy the time that I have left. So see, you can get on that plane and go to Seattle. I'm gonna be okay. - You know you can't expect me to keep this from everybody, right? - Oh, you have no choice. (sniffs) - Selfish woman. This is selfish. If they had any idea, they would be here right now, they would be here everyday! - Yes, yes, they would be here everyday falling apart and I just cannot watch that. - Well sometimes it's not about what you want. - Excuse me? - Yeah. We're gonna fall apart anyway and that's something you're just gonna have to deal with.

You know I'm not calling you Malachi. - [Malachi] Whatever, man. - How are you, Malachi? - (laughs) And how are you doing, my beautiful black, my beautiful queen? - (laughs) You know, I was good, but now I'm great. - Amazing. (laughs) - [Megan] I'll see you inside, okay? - All right. Hey brah, man, why you gotta be so difficult, huh? - What you mean, man? I don't really see it that way. I mean when you so used to calling a man by one name your entire life, all of a sudden you call him by another name just because his bougie ass wife told him to? Doesn't work like that. - Well, all right, whatever well, I see somebody still is afraid to put a ring on it. (laughs) but you know what? I understand because it takes a real man to step up to the plate. (laughs) Oh, snap, look at this, pretty boy Zay. (laughs) You mean to tell me that this dude stepped away from his player's life long enough to come and spend Christmas with us? Brah, how did you make that happen? - Hey man, come on, that's my brother. Leave him alone, okay? - You know I heard you, right? - He's a changed man now. - (laughs) Yeah, still good at changing women. What, no. This dude opening doors for women now? (laughs) Hot damn, pigs must be flying. - Very funny, fake ass Malcolm X. (chuckling) - Oh man. - Okay, what's up, brah? - What's going on, Zay? (laughs) - I'm doing good man, long as you don't sell me none of them stale ass bean pies. - [Malachi] Well, whatever, brah. - (laughing) He got your game, brah. - Whatever, both of y'all hush. Oh man. - Hey, baby, this is my brother David and that here is Michael, aka, Malachi, aka Louis Farrakhan's bastard lost child. - [Malachi] Whatever man, how you doing by beautiful black, (laughs) come on, man, let me greet your beautiful woman here. How you doing my beautiful Nubian goddess. So good to meet you. - You too. - Brah, why must I have so much hate in thy spirit when you have such a beautiful Nubian goddess by your side? - Gosh, it's overkill at this point, Mike, cut it out, dude. - All right, man, where is everybody at, man? - Everybody's inside, man, except for Elijah. - All right, well come on baby, let's go. I'm going inside before I get converted to a Muslim. (laughing) Come on. - All right. (laughs) You okay, bro? - No, I'm not okay. My life is in a million pieces. - You'll be fine, you just gotta let shit smooth over, okay? I mean Kevin Hart cheated on his wife. R. Kelly had people trapped in the basement and Usher gave all his groupies herpes and they all bounced back. - Yeah, you're right. - Yeah. - Right, I just don't know how to handle it, you know? - I mean shit man, can't do what you been doing. Keep sucking and sucking-- - Xavier. (laughing) - It's like a shit man, look, listen, look at it like this, you don't have to sing about women anymore, you could start singing about men. You know what I'm saying? You ain't gotta act no more, brah, start living your truth, the faggot that you are. (laughing) Shit, you know what I'm sayin'? - Yeah, I might be a faggot, but I'll whip your ass. - Try it here. - Hey y'all come on, chill out, all right? - Fellahs-- - Relax. (sighing) - [Angel] What's going on up there? - [Dylan] Momma. - Yeah, we're fine, all right? Just happy to see each other. - Yeah. - [Angel] Dinner's ready. Wash your hands and come on down. - [Xavier] All right momma, I'm coming. Shit, I wanna try your food anyway. Okay ma. - I'm gonna whoop his ass. I'm not playing that shit today. - You don't have to do all of that, all right? There's no need for violence. Can we all just get along for mama please? - We are non-violent with those who are non-violent with us. - Nigger, did you just quote Malcolm X? - Come on, let's go eat before the great menace, Malachi starts to speak in tongues. - Muslims don't speak in tongues, brah. - [David] Whatever. ♪ I just wanna keep on waiting ♪ ♪ Underneath the mistletoe ♪ ♪ I will make a list and send it ♪ ♪ To the North Pole for Saint Nick ♪ - Bartholomew.

The boys, they love their new school. - I mean, they're getting so big. I'm just glad they're doing okay after they lost their mom. (people agreeing) - Yeah, the boys, you know, they understand that she's in a better place, you know, they get it. - Just glad they were able to spend some time with her before she passed. I mean, just imagine what it would be like if she were to pass away and nobody got a chance to say goodbye. - Um, yeah, Megan, I just love your blouse. - Oh, (clears throat) (laughs) why thank you, Mama Angel. - Yeah, the earrings are lovely too. - [Megan] Thanks. - Yeah.

I'm sure he'll run away then. - Oh, don't come for my man. - I'm just letting you know the truth, that's it. - Okay, be quiet, eat.

Now, the Koran teaches us that we should avoid harming each other. We should be generous to one another and we also should behave in the best manner. - Mm, beautiful words, baby. - [Malachi] Thank you, mama. - And the Bible say something similar. In Romans 12:10, it says, be devoted to one another in brotherly love and preference one another in honor. - Angel, how do you feel about two Muslims raising children that don't know Allah, but know Jesus? - Well, I mean, I think there are many inter-religious households out there, but as long as you believe in a higher being and have guiding values, I believe it could work. However, I gave my boys the freedom to choose whatever religion they wanted to. - So you were flexible? - Yeah. My babies came from all different walks of life and I felt that it was important for them to hold on to whatever was important to them. - Hm. So do you feel that the lack of a strong religious structure had a negative outcome on their relationships? (clears throat) - Mama, damn, what did you put in this pie? This thing is good. - Mama, this pie is delicious. (people agreeing) You know what? I think I'm gonna have me another piece. Better yet, you should cook this on your next episode. - Maybe I should. Now Emani, back to your question-- - Mm, matter of fact, you know what? You should do a Christmas special. That's what you should do. - Yeah, that's a great idea, son. Now Emani, like I was about to say-- (doorbell rings) Oh, I wasn't expecting anyone. Excuse me. (whispering) - Don't start this now. (arguing quietly) (doorbell rings) - [Angel] Oh, why Charisse, what brings you here? - I'm here 'cause I'm bringing her here. I heard her daddy was in town and what he's not gonna do is continue to act as if my child does not exist. So what I'm gonna need for you to do is go on inside and tell him to bring his black ass out 'cause he's got about 13 years worth of Christmas gifts that he owe us. - Now this is not-- - First of all, don't Charisse me. Xavier! Get yo' black ass out here because I know you in there! - Okay, let's be reasonable about this. There's a child involved. (laughing) - Let me tell you what reasonable is, reasonable is a grown ass man taking care of his own child even if he's a broke ass nigger. He still need to have some type of presence in his own child's life. My daughter is becoming a teenager. She needs her father. - This is not the way to do things, not like this. - I'm sorry, what is it that you're not understanding 'cause I've been trying for years, okay? Now Miss Angel, I understand that that fool of yours is your son, but I ain't never took you to be no dumb bitch. - Dumb bitch? - Hey man, don't you come talking to my mama like that. You tripping, tripping. - Daddy. - I told you. (laughs) Okay, this is what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna leave her here for a reasonable amount of time with that fool. Um sweetie, Zooey, you wanted your daddy. There his big ass is, okay, boo? I'm out, all right? - [Zooey] But ma, I would-- - Don't but ma me, okay? You already got your Christmas gift early. I'm out. Bye. (laughs) I'm out! - Well everybody, this is Zooey, Xavier's oldest daughter. You hungry, baby? - Not really, I just ate. - Okay, well, let's get you settled in upstairs. You must be tired after that long drive. (sighs) Come on. - Uh, bro, you need to go. - Go where? - Go check on your daughter, dumb ass. (sighs) (slow walking footsteps) - Are you sure this is a good idea? They got a lot of shit going on. - Well damn, there's a lot of people in there. (exasperated breath) Let me think. Let me think. I think we should come back during the party. - Right. - 'Cause they'll be distracted. It'll be a good way to get in. (labored breathing) Now let's go. - Which way? - Down there. (bells jingling) (sighs) - I am so sorry we had to meet like this. - It's not your fault. - Are you okay? - I guess so. I wanted to meet him, maybe ask a few questions, but not be dropped off. - Yeah, I understand that. (laughs) Well I hate we had to wait this long to meet, hm? Oh. - I should be the one apologizing, not you, mama. - Oh well, I'll let you two talk. Okay. - Why didn't you want me? - Huh? - After all these years, you never came to see me. No birthday gifts, no Christmas. - I never meant to let so much time go by. See, when you was a baby, I got into some trouble. I got put away for some time. - How much time? - Seven years. - For what? - I stole a couple cars. - How many? - About 30 that they know of. - So what about after you got out, why didn't you come see me then? - I felt like I ain't had nothing to offer you. I've been trying to get myself together. I didn't want you to see me like that. - Are you together now? - I'm working on it. - (sighs) When I was a little girl, I will cry for you, I will cry myself to sleep. All the other girls would always have their dads for the father daughter dance and I would just have my mother. Grandpa came one year and then he died. - I'm sorry, baby. - (sighs) There was always this song that came on. Mama said it was a classic. The other girls would go crazy. It was called, "Dance With My Father". - (chuckles) Yeah. Yeah, it's a classic. You know my brother, Dylan. - Really? - Yeah, he made a cover to the song. - Your brother's Dylan? - Mmhmm. - I thought I saw him downstairs.

So, it would be perfect for the boys to stay here. - (sighs) Look, I'm going to sleep, all right? - Oh no, we need to talk about this. - Emani, baby, you talked. All right, I have nothing to say. - Conversation is not over. I didn't sign up for this. - (sighs) Woman, do you hear yourself right now, huh? You asking a man to get rid of his own flesh and blood all because it reminds you of their dead mother? - Wow, you have no idea how heartbreaking this is for me. - What? Do you think you're the only one hurting, huh? I lost my wife. I lost the love of my life. My boys lost their mother, the most important woman in their lives. We're heartbroken so fuck your heartbreak! Your ego is what's broken. Our hearts will forever have a hole in it. So you can do one of two things, you can help fill that hole or you can get the fuck out of our lives! - Excuse me? - I've been waiting to say this shit for a long time, Emani, I'm tired of your bullshit! I'm tired of it! - Malachi, my feelings are valid and my feelings should matter to you! Hey, don't you want me to be happy? - Look, okay, I love you, all right, but I'm not gonna choose you over my children. That's just something I'm not gonna do because at the end of the day, you can decide to leave and then what will I have, huh? My boys and my mother are all I have. I'm not gonna leave my kids on the curb like my mother did me, okay? I was in therapy for 10 years, 10 years in therapy. My mother left me on the curb. I'm not gonna do that to my boys. It took 10 years for that woman to love the fuck outta me for me to realize that I was worth something. She adopted me when I was 10 years old. So for 10 years, for 10 years I went from house to house. For 10 years, I felt like nobody wanted me. She adopted me at 10 years old. So for 10 years, I went from house to house. For 10 years, I thought I was better off dead. For 10 years, I didn't think anybody wanted me. For 10 years, I didn't even know what love was. I don't want to hear you say another goddam thing about my boys. You can either step up and be their mother or you can get the fuck out of our lives because there is no way in hell that they gonna go through what I went through. Do you hear me?! (door rattles) (door slams shut) Mama, thank you. (crying) If I've never told you anything before, I just wanna let you know, I appreciate you. I wouldn't be the man I am today if it wasn't for you, thank you. (crying) (crying) Thank you, thank you. (sobbing) - It's okay. - None of us would be who we are if it wasn't for you, mama. - I don't know what I would do without you, mama. - Yeah, I'd probably be dead if it wasn't for you. Thank you for saving me. (sighs) (sobbing) - It's okay, baby. It's okay. (sobbing) (coughing) (knocking at the door) Who is it? (clears throat) - [Emani] It's me, Emani, it's me Emani. - Come in. Hi, you okay? - Um, I think I owe you an apology. I'm sorry for my behavior. - Oh, Emani, I get it and I get you. - I don't know how to be who they need. - (sighs) (chuckles) I fostered five boys. (laughs) Five unruly boys and everyday I had to look them in their eyes, knowing that I wasn't their mother, that I didn't carry them and that I wouldn't have the connection that I wish I could. (coughs) - So how did you do it? Because (sighs) I feel like such an outsider and walking around my house looking at pictures of their mother, it's killing me. - Yeah, well I took it day by day. (sighs) Emani, I know we both have two different religions and but I do know, is that we believe in one higher being, a higher being that brings us, brings us things for a reason. And Emani, God brought you those boys for a reason and whether you believe it or not, those boys need you. (laughs) And you just gonna have to understand that. And everyday won't be easy, but it'll get better. But it won't get better if you look at those boys like they're a foreign object. - I have a question, what made you wanna adopt all these boys? And I mean, at such a young age? - Get on up here. (coughing) Well, (sighs) (laughs) a failed marriage will make you do some crazy things. (laughs) We tried to have a baby for a few years, but I just couldn't. So my husband left me. He said I was only half of a woman. So during the divorce, I got this house paid in full and a large lump sum of money and that's when I met your husband stealing out of the grocery store. (laughs) Oh, I stopped him, paid for the food and we became fast friends. Every week I would see him standing outside of that grocery store and then finally I said, "Where are your parents?" And that's when he told me his heartbreaking story. So I went home, slept on it and I adopted him. And after a year of us being together, Christmas came and he made a Christmas list and on that list he asked for a little brother. (laughs) There I was again, having to relive the fact that I couldn't deliver, but then God, he spoke to me. So I, I adopted Xavier. (laughs) Good God and then the next year, Xavier put on his Christmas list that he wanted a little brother because he didn't wanna be the youngest. (laughs) So I went down to the agency and they showed me these two little boys, Elijah and David and I just couldn't make the decision. So I choose both of 'em. There, there, I was done, four was enough. Oh, but then one of my friends died during childbirth and that's how I got Dylan. Now Dylan was the only one that I had from birth. - So all these boys, you never wanted a little girl? - Yeah, I wanted whatever God would bless me with. (laughs) Oh but honestly, I couldn't handle a little girl with all these boys. (laughs) You see 'em. - And here I was trying to give you two more for Christmas. He won't tell you, but I was trying to convince him to let you take the kids. I wasn't seeing straight. I feel so selfish. - Oh baby, don't you beat yourself up. The problem is, we all have this dream picture of what, what our lives should be and what our families should look like and as women, we see that at a very young age. No woman every pictures themselves as raising somebody else's children, but sometimes we just gotta let go of that dream and open up our hearts to what God has for us. - Yeah, you're right. - Take your time. It'll all work out, I promise you that. - Thanks. - No problem. (laughs) Now, I know you don't celebrate Christmas, but in this house, we like to love on one another and celebrate family, okay? So no more fighting. - No more fighting. - That's right. (coughing) - Are you okay? (coughing) - Just a little cough, I'm gonna be all right. (coughing) - [Emani] All right, let me get you some water. - [Zooey] Are you okay, Miss Angel? (coughing) - [Emani] Are you okay? I'm gonna, (gasps) you're coughing up blood. - [Zooey] Daddy, daddy! - No, no, don't call 'em, they'll just panic. - [Xavier] What's going on, baby girl? - [Zooey] Grandma is sick. - Sick? (coughing) Is it back again? - [Emani] Is what back? - What's up? - Answer me, mama, is the cancer back? - Yeah, it's been back for a few weeks. - What you mean it's been back for a few weeks? You ain't tell nobody? How long have you known about this? - Come on, man, she wanted to tell everybody herself. - How long, David? - Since Thanksgiving. - Thanksgiving and you hold something like this from us for that long? - Zav, calm down. - Calm down? How you expect me to calm down, huh, how? - Hey, hey, what's up? What's going on? - Man, mama's cancer's back and this nigger been knowing since Thanksgiving. - What, mama. - Is this the reason why you wanted us all to come back home? - Yeah, it is. All right, but I shouldn't have to make anybody do anything. Y'all shoulda been here for Thanksgiving. - [Angel] David. - No, come on, they shoulda been here. I mean, y'all shoulda been here for Thanksgiving to find out for yourselves. - David-- - No, come on, ma. - David, don't do this-- - No, it's true. They never come by. They never check on you. Phone calls and text messages don't count. You make time for the people that you love. - (sighs) Look mom, I'm so sorry. I mean, have you at least started treatment yet? - (coughs) We need to talk about this. - Oh mama, hey, we all here, so we're listening, what's going on? (sighs) - There is no treatment. - What do you mean there is no treatment? - I have chosen not to take treatment this time. This is my third time and I am tired. - So you're just gonna give up on us? You can't leave us, we need you. - I already tried to talk about it. - What are her options, David? - Well my friend knows about this new trial that she can be a part of, but she has to agree to it first. - I need to go get a drink. - Mama, where you going? - To get a drink of water. (coughing) (slow somber music) - Mama, you gotta sign up for that trial. - Oh, she's signing up for this trial. - Mama look, no is not an option. - Mama, I'm taking you in after Christmas. - No. Now I have fought and I have fought and I have fought and I am tired. My body is so very tired. All I want is to make it to my birthday and spend my last days with my boys. I'm not doing chemo. I'm not doing radiation. I'm not doing a trial. I'm not doing any treatment. Now y'all are grown. You have your own lives and it's time for you to grow up! Now there is life and there is death and you have to understand it. Now I have prayed about this cancer so much that my knees have blisters. Every time they tell me that it's gone, it comes back over and over and over again. This is not the life that I wanna live the rest of my life fighting this disease forever. Now instead of telling me what I need to do, you need to be men, men I raised you to be! Get your shit together. No, don't touch me, don't touch me. Now I am tired and I'm gonna go upstairs and I'm going to sleep. Now tomorrow's Christmas Eve and I'm gonna wake up and we not gonna talk about this. I just wanna enjoy my Christmas. (coughing) (labored breathing) (coughing) - I tried to talk to her. - Why didn't you just tell us? - I promised her I wouldn't. You know, I figured if she didn't say anything during this visit, I would just sit you all down and tell you myself. - So how long does she have left? - The doctor says six weeks. - Six weeks, what? - The cancer's more aggressive this time, guys and by her not doing the treatment, it's taking over. The blood is a sign that it's moving to her lungs. - So we just need a miracle then. - I mean this trial would be the miracle, but she has to be a part of it first. It's literally her last option. (sighs) - I mean, what are we supposed to do, huh? Are we supposed to just all sit around and just watch her die? - We can't do that. There's something we gotta do to be able to get through to her. - I don't know how. - Elijah. - Huh? - He's always had mama's heart. - Well you know they've been at odds ever since he went to the military, but it could work. - They haven't really spoken in five years. - Well look, if that's our only option, then what we need to do is we need to get Elijah on the phone and tell him that he needs to come home. - I already tried. They denied his leave. - No! You need to get Elijah on the phone and tell him that mama is dying, all right? He needs to come home and he needs to come home now. Davey, call him again. Tell him to bring his ass home! (gentle somber music) - Hey bro, what's going on, man? Yeah, yeah, no, I'm good, I'm good, um. (gentle somber music) - G-ma, are you cooking pancakes? - Yep, I sure am. - I love breakfast food. - I love your pancakes. My new mom can't cook. - Really, Malik? Is that how you really feel? - You can't cook like G-ma. - Hm. - Our old mama couldn't cook either. Daddy has a thing for women that can't cook. - Excuse me. - Uh, Emani, why don't you come on over here and help me. I'll teach you my recipe, come on. (laughs) So, what I do is, I put a cup of all-purpose flour, take a little pinch of (voice trails off) - Hey mama, you need some help? - (sighs) I'm good, baby.

Let me go, let me go! - [Angel] Get your ass in the house. - [man] You know you still love me. - Fuck you! - [Man] Yeah that's what you've been doing the last four years, remember? - Oh baby, look at you.

Now if y'all want my annual Christmas breakfast, I need to get some sleep. (coughing) - All right, mama. - Goodnight, sis. - Let's go get some cake. - (sighs) Wait, wait, wait a minute, why does everybody keep asking her how she feeling? - Yeah, like she dying or something. - Well I mean, she didn't look her best. - Faith. - What? - (sighs) It's back. - What's back? - The cancer and she not taking the treatment and I need to have a talk to her. - Well, how long has it been back? - I don't know, but the doctor only gave her six weeks. - What? - There's this new trial at my hospital, but she is refusing to be a part of it. - Yeah well as fucked up as that may be, we are going to have to respect her wishes. None of y'all truly know what she went through that last two years. I was there with her, every minute and it wasn't nothing pretty. - Wait a minute now, sis, so we're supposed to sit back and just let her give up? - We are not letting her give up. Roy, it's a transition. Life is a transition. Death is not the greatest loss in life. Death is just a part of life. - But no one wants to see their mother die. - No baby, but eventually you're gonna have to. (sniffs) Roy, you remember that riddle grandma used to say? - Life asks death, "How come everybody love me, but they hate you?" - Hm, and death responded, "Because you are a beautiful lie "and I am the painful truth." - (sighs) Look, boys, it's true, death ain't something you can prepare yourself for so you just gotta live each minute like it's the last. (doorbell rings) - Who is it now? Damn, the party over. (claps hands) - I'll get it. (knocking on door) Elijah? - [Elijah] What's up, man? - [David] How did you even just-- - [Elijah] Oh now, I moved Heaven and Earth to get here, man. Just pray I don't go get arrested for going AWOL. - [David] Well look man, you just missed the party. Step in. - [Elijah] Hey everybody, how y'all doing? (group greeting Elijah) - [Malachi] What's up bro? (grunts) - How y'all doing, guys? (group responding) Where's mama? - Eh, she, she went to sleep. (sighs) - All right, cool, I'm gonna go say hi. (sighs) (gentle quiet music) (knocking) Mama. Mama? Mama? Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! Oh shit. (gentle somber piano music) Mama, Mama? Mama? Come on mama, get up. Mama get up. Help! Help! - Hey mama, you gotta come down and see. (laughs) Mama. (sobbing) (muttering) What's going on? What's going on, mama? - (sobbing) I found her on the floor and she wasn't moving. - Come on. - Ah, how bad is the cancer, yo? How bad is the cancer, David? - Listen man, calm down. We just gotta get her some help, man, calm down. - I'll call 911. - Megan! Megan! - Oh my God. - Baby, you gotta help. Baby, she's not breathing. - Mama Angel, Mama Angel, can you hear me? - This 911? Yes, it's my mom, she's a cancer patient. She's unresponsive. We're at 630 Echo Street, Atlanta. No, when was the last time she had chemo? - [David] She's not on chemo, man. - What do you mean she's not on chemo? - She didn't want no radiation. Just tell 'em to get the fuck here, man. - Okay, okay, no chemo, no radiation, they're doing CPR right now. Yes, we have two doctors in the family. Okay got you, hurry up please. - Wait, what's wrong? Mama! - [Dylan] Is she okay? Oh my God. - [Malachi] Oh my God. - I just found her. She was in the bathroom passed out. - [Xavier] Come on mama, come on mama, stay here for us, come on. - Why the fuck wasn't she getting treatment? David, you're a fucking doctor, man. What the fuck's going on, man? - She refused the treatment, man. - What? Wait. Did you know when you called me? Did you know when you called me? - I've known since Thanksgiving, man, she wanted to tell everybody herself. - What the fuck and you didn't say shit? You was gonna leave us in the fucking dark? (yelling over each other) - The fuck, don't talk to me like that, all right? You're the one who been gone for five years. You ain't called her, you ain't sent her a letter or nothing like that. So don't come at me talking about what the fuck I coulda been doing when you ain't been doing shit, nigger. Come on! - Goddammit, goddamn. - [Malachi] Calm your ass down, boy! - He shoulda told her! (screaming) (siren blaring) Somebody call an ambulance. - I think I hear 'em outside. Let's go, let's go, let's go, come on. Come on, let's go. - [Xavier] Come on, I need you, mama. I need you mama. Oh mama, be strong, mama. Mama. (crying) You're a fighter, you've been here before. This ain't your first time, this ain't your first rodeo. I need you to ride this one. (people muttering) (praying) - [Uncle Roy] I pray that you lay your hands on my sister. Keep her with us just a little bit-- - [Malachi] This ain't your time! - [Megan] Come on Angel, come on. - [Roy] Come on, it's gonna be all right, she gonna be all right. Be strong now. - (sobbing) Please get up. - [Xavier] Damn, where's that ambulance! (sobbing) - [Xavier] Come on mama, come on mama. - One, two, three, four, five. - [Roy] Where's that damn ambulance? (people muttering) (crying) (slow somber music) - You got to stay with me, you got to stay. Now Angel, you better come back to me! (sobbing) (gentle somber music) - Now listen, I know this is tough on you guys, but we gotta stick together. Now she needs us to be strong. She's a fighter, but we gotta let the doctors do their job. - Dad, dad we should pray. - That's right, we should pray. And you should lead us. (sighs) - Dear heavenly Father, we ask that you send your angels to help heal an angel. Lord please cover her in your anointed and protect her body from foreign intruders. Father we ask that you empower the hands that are working on her for we know that all things are possible through you and your grace and we ask please extend her life so that she may receive our love and we may continue to receive hers as long as you can, Father, please. In Jesus' name, I pray. Amen. - Amen, amen. That was real nice, son, I appreciate it. Pastor Jordan, you made it. - Yes, sir, where is she? - Oh she's in ICU. - Can we see her? I wanna pray over her right now. - Uh (sighs) - Hi, are you all the family of Angel Williams? - Yes, we are, how's she doing? - She's not doing too good right now. - What you mean? - Her heart rate is extremely high and her blood pressure's really low. Now I put her on a few steroids to see if I could slow down her heart rate. Just wait and see how that does. - Can we see her? - I'm afraid not right now. There's just way too much going on in there right now. - Ma'am, we need to see her right now. - I'm sorry, that's impossible. Any extra excitement will only raise her heart rate. - (laughs) May I ask a question, what is your job, ma'am? - I'm the cardiologist specialist. - Ah, ah, cardiologist, you're a heart doctor. - No, I'm the cardiologist specialist. - Mm, well what's the difference? - You see, I'm the one they call when the cardiologist fails at his job. That's why I'm here. - I understand, but you're missing part of her treatment. I need to be in the room right now. - And who are you? - I am Joseph Jordan. - Okay and what is it that you do, Joseph? - I work for the man that we all call on when you fail. Can you please escort us to the room? - Please. - Listen, at least let the pastor and her sons go in. The rest of us, we can wait out here in the lobby. - All right, it has to be quick. ♪ Never could have made it without you ♪ ♪ I would have lost it all ♪ ♪ But now I see ♪ - I'm sorry, mom. I'm sorry, but you can't leave me. - Everybody put a hand on your mother. Lord, we come before you ever so humble. My heart feels as if there's 1,000 knives running through it. I am weary. I am spent and I am very sad. Please help me, Lord, please hear my prayer. Hold me and my family up. Please give us the strength to walk through. Please be present, be persistent with your love. Carry us through this heartache, sustain us, give us joy, give us hope. First Corinthians chapter 15, verse 54 and 55 say that death is swallowed in victory. Oh death, where is your victory? Oh death, where is your sting? Where is the sting of death for the believer? It's ripped out. At the cross, Jesus ripped the stinger from death so us, as Christians, we should no longer fear death because our souls will forever be with Christ as we walk in your truth, Lord. Please keep our eyes fixed on heavenly things and though we know there will be terrifying events that we will face through this life, but ultimately, the victory belongs to you and as we continue to walk in your truth, Lord keep our eyes fixed on heavenly things. Oh Lord God, we trust you and if you see fit, give Angel the strength, give her the strength, Lord, to fight and live another day. We are forever grateful that we are forever covered in your grace. In your son's name, Jesus, we pray. Amen. - [Group] Amen. - Mama, if you can hear me, I love you. - We all love you. (crying) - We gotta sing for her. She used to love when we sang some of her favorite songs. - Which song, bro? - Boys to Men, of course. - All right.

Now we are gonna go ahead and bow our head for prayer. Lord Jesus, we come before you today ever so humble. Today I cry tears that mean 100 different things at once, happy and sorrowful and desperate and hopeful. I trust you to sort them out as you catch them. I hear an answer. I hope you hear an answer each prayer they represent. I cry for those of us left behind for the lonely ones with hallows in our hearts. I ask you to comfort us, give us peace, restore hope and lavish us with love, family and belonging. In the depths of loss, meet us with yourself. I cry for the legacy this loved one leaves. (sighs) For the ways the world has been made better by her presence, for the memories that become both more beautiful and more painful on this side of death and I pray that the work you have accomplished in this remarkable life will grow deeper, wider and stronger in the days to come and for all the ways you're making it right again. I ask that you make me part of your work into bringing the Kingdom of Heaven to Earth. I cry knowing you are here for me and because you are here, even my tears have meaning. Amen. - [Everyone] Amen. - We will now open the floor for reflections.

She was trying to get a part-time job so she could get our Christmas gift off of layaway So we could have 'em in time for Christmas. - (sighs) I looked at the line that asked about past professions and I remember thinking to myself-- - It's too small to write down what she's been. - Everyday, everyday my mother worked that job, (crying) everyday, my mother, she helped me with my homework. Everyday, my mother, she cooked us dinner. - Everyday, even though she was tired, she loved us no less. - (crying) We never wanted for anything. Nothing. - She raised me to be the best man I could be. - So when I sit back and I think about everything that this woman has been to me, how she showed me unconditional love-- (sighs) - My mama had this favorite song. It was by Trevor Campbell, "I'm Ready". ♪ I'm ready to love you forever ♪ ♪ Hey love now, come love me forever more ♪ - I'm ready to love you forever. (crying) This woman had so much love. (crying) They say that God will send you angels while you're here on Earth. Well God, I want you to know, I'm very thankful and grateful for my angel because I was blessed to call my angel, mama. - My mama. - My mama. - All my mama. - Be able to call my mama. - My mother. (crying) - I love you mama, forever. - I love you, our angel, and I'll never forget you. I'll always remember to do what you told me to do and keep God first. I just ask that you send me a woman down here that can cook half as good as you because I don't know what I'm gonna do without your cooking. - Not many black women would accept a white girl dating their son. (laughs) I always feared going to meet Mama Angel for the first time, but they named her Angel for a reason (laughs) 'cause that's what she was. I am so, so grateful to have been in her presence and to have been able to accept her love. And I'm so grateful for all the nights that we stayed up and she taught me to cook. (laughs) Her recipes, collard greens, macaroni and cheese. (laughs) That is priceless. I love you, Angel, thank you. I'll take good care of him. I promise. - I'm sad that I only got to know you for a few days, but to think of the possibility to have never met you, I appreciate the time we had together. I have always loved to cook and just in those few days, I've learned so much. When I grow up, I'm gonna own my own restaurant and name it Angel's Heavenly Kitchen. There will be a big picture of you on the sign so everyone knows how much I love you. - Mama Angel, thank you for always accepting me. Thank you for loving Dylan and I regardless of what society had to say. When my mother disowned me, you took me in so today I feel like I lost a mother as well, but through it all, I have to remember what you told me when my grandmother died, you said, "When you loose someone special to you here on Earth, "you gain a powerful angel "fighting for you on the other side." So I'm happy to know that I have the most powerful angel fighting for me now. - [Together] Thank you G-ma for teaching our new mama how to cook. - I know that my family and I share a different religion than all of you, but I think it's safe to say that, we all know what it's like to lose someone that we love. Angel and I had a lot in common, (laughs) a lot more than I ever wanted to admit to myself. We are both mothers who (crying) to children that we didn't birth and it wasn't until after talking to Angel that I learned the true meaning of loving someone unconditionally. Loving someone so much despite their flaws and despite them not being yours. (crying) Angel, thank you for making me see the value of life, the value of love and the value of family. I will forever be in debt to you. - You know, I didn't know Mama Angel that long and I wish I woulda got more time to spend with her, but the time that we did spend was some of the best moments that I'll cherish forever. (crying) She was always so loving and kind. (crying) She opened up her home and her heart to me and taught me the true value of family. I'm gonna miss you, Angel. - My sister, she was a gift, a gift from God and she always held a special place in my heart. She was my mini-me when we were growing up and I never thought, I never thought (crying) I never thought that she would leave this earth before me, but God, you called my Angel home. (gentle somber music) (sighs) - When the boys asked me to deliver the eulogy, I was afraid, but I was honored. Now I had to ask myself, what what can you say about a woman so great as my sister, Angel? (sniff) I um, my sister, she was the baby. (laughs) But she was the bossy one. I mean, she was special and as a little girl, she would always remind me, she would always say, "My name is Angel "and my sister is Heaven and we are special (laughs) "and you just Roy." (laughs) But hey, she's, she was my little sister so I just let her say what she wanted to say because I love her. I love her. You see my sister was special because she was made different. You know, she was made kinda like her world famous banana pudding. I mean, there's so many ingredients, so many layers, but she was still the sweetest thing you ever come across, but my son, R.J., and he would call it Nana's Pudding and everybody loved Nana's Pudding. I mean there was just something about that pudding. You know when I was thinking about my sister last night, I thought there had to be something in that, I mean to make people that excited, there had to be something in that that we could take away today for ourselves and add to our lives and remember her always. You see, in cooking, there are three stages. First you have the prep time. Now first you have the prep time and that's when you, that's when you set the temperature and when you're making a banana pudding, you gotta make sure that the oven is warmed in advance. Then, then you got the cook time. That's when God is working, working with us and getting us in that space, that's when God is getting us situated so that we and we're prepped for this life. We live. I want somebody to turn to your neighbors and say, "It is time for somebody to live." - [Group] It is time for somebody to live. - Yes, and we ask, we ask what are those ingredients that we are needed to give us that expected outcome? First we have flour. Now flour is in the Bible. Now flour represents the truth of God. Now God, God will pour that flour into a sifter. Amen and some of y'all don't, y'all don't know the point of the sifter. Now the sifter will separate all of the clumps of our life, all of the arrogance, all of the anger, all of the uptight-ness. See, God, he would pour us into a sifter and we come out fine. I want you to look at somebody and say, "You, you, you are fine." - [Group] You are fine. (laughing) Now my sister never judged anybody. she just had a way of sifting all of that stuff out of your life. Then you have sugar, pure cane sugar. Now the sugar, what that represented was the boost of energy. Now look, I know that, I know that sometimes we all get down, but there was just something about when Angel came around with that banana pudding, would just give you a boost of energy. It was hard to be around her and still be sad 'cause just like her sweet banana pudding, she was a ball of energy. Salt. Salt is of the Earth. Now we use salt to preserve our covenant with God. (laughs) Now my sister, she was big on the church. You can ask her boys that now, she was serious when it came to waking up in time for church. (laughs) She would always say, "I'm gonna make sure "that they have a strong foundation with God. "I'm gonna make sure that they maintain "and preserve that foundation "because I'm gonna keep them in church." And she did. But most importantly, she preserved the word of God. So when she dropped that salt in her pudding, she was saying, there are some things that we, some stuff we need to preserve. Now I know that there are some of y'all here that are hunkered down because she no longer with us, but you need to know that that merengue on top was important and she took the yolk from an egg and she made that merengue light and fluffy. You see it's no coincidence that we loved this dish because each time she was ministering us every time she made it. She was saying, "Baby, I'm making your stress light. "I'm making your situation easy." And when you think about it, Angel really was an angel. I mean, she was just like Jesus. I mean she was loving us and not judging us and just being what she needed to be and even in her transition, she made sure she did not leave these boys uncovered. She taught Malachi how to make a banana pudding. She taught Xavier, she taught Elijah, she taught David and even Dylan. She made sure that even in her absence, that we all had what we needed to keep moving forward. Ezekiel 16:13 and then I'm gonna close with that. Thou eats from fine flour and honey and oils and when you mix all that together, you've got something exceedingly beautiful and thou didst prosper into a kingdom. When she made her banana pudding, she only used three bananas, one for the Father, one for the Son and one for the Holy Ghost. And if your vision, if your dream is all about you, then it's too small. Now she took the bananas like Jesus took fish and if I give you fish, you will eat, but tomorrow you will come back hungry, but if I could teach you how to fish, then you can feed and take care of yourself. You all need to listen to me, when Angel shared her recipe with those boys, she was making sure that they could take care of themselves and survive in her absence. Not only did she make sure those boys was covered, but she made sure that for generations, her family would be loved, blessed and fed. Y'all should hear her right now. Say well, well, well. (clapping) (sighs) Look uh, if there's any of you here in this time, in this moment that that your vision, your dream is just about you and nobody else, then I encourage you to be like Angel and change.
