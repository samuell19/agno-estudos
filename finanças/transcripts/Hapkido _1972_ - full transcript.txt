1934, SEOUL, KOREA Hmm. All right. (Korean) Young lady! Mind your manners! l'm not Korean. You are Chinese, eh? Good, Chinese girls are very nice! Very nice indeed. The Great Japanese Empire will soon take over China. You...! Chinese girls are my favourite. - Bastard! Come on, kill them! - Yes! HAP Kl DO HEADQUARTERS Hap Ki Do? Master! Well done! You're quick-witted and intelligent enough not to force your way out. Master! Wei, you're hotheaded. You're courageous, but you lack strategy. There's no place for such recklessness in the martial arts. You should learn to use your wits and be patient like Ying. Yes, Master. Master, don't flatter me. l only acted opportunely. l knew that l couldn't beat Wei, so l used the bouncing force to escape. That was where you showed your quick-wittedness. l've learned from the escape technique of Shaolin Kung Fu in China. The basics of Hap Ki Do are derived from the ''locks and breaks'' of T'ai Chi. They are easy to learn, but difficult to master and to apply. The way you fought your way out was not bad, although it lacked agility. Let's talk inside. THE EAGLE SCHOOL OF HAP Kl DO, KOREA lt's been over five years since you came to Korea to study Hap Ki Do. As you are Chinese, you inherit a wonderful national heritage. You are smart, quick on the uptake, and you have excellent moral values. Unfortunately, you beat up those Japanese men and got into trouble. You can't stay here any longer. So, today l've promoted you to the Seventh Degree Black Belt of Hap Ki Do. l want you to set up your own schools in China to teach this martial art. Thank you, Master. You do well in the basic movements, but those are rather formulaic. Now your Big Brother will demonstrate. Starting with the basics, using the muscles around the waist. Stand back. Ying, you give it a go. Yes! These are formulaic movements. The targets are at a fixed distance. When you fight against your enemies, those are live targets. They're constantly moving. So, you must react quickly to situations, and be able to apply what you've learned. Although you often practise fighting with one another, that's not real fighting. lt's easy for you to predict each other's moves. Earlier, the three of you were unable to beat your Big Brother only because he was more experienced in competing. During a fight, you must watch your enemy's eyes, so that you know where they'll attack. Only then can you pre-empt their attack. Let me show you how. - Come on. - Yes. - Stand in position. - Yes. - Your turn. - Yes. Come with me. Forbearance. lt is the hardest ability to acquire. Yet it is the spiritual core of Hap Ki Do. lt is also the greatest characteristic of the Chinese people. Hap Ki Do is based on the ''lock and break'' of T'ai Chi and other martial arts. When you return home and set up your own schools, you must remember this idea and work together in this spirit. See everyone as your family, and be tolerant of different ideas. Respect your elders. Help the weak and the poor. l know you are young, hotheaded and full of ideals. You're belligerent. The saying goes, ''A warrior dies in a war.'' You must remember not to be overconfident and pick fights. You must learn forbearance. - Do you understand? - Yes, we do. My wife embroidered the eagle motif on these Hap Ki Do gowns. Take them with you. - We will always think of you. - Thank you so much. We... FORBEARANCE Master, what should we do when things become unbearable? Let me be honest with you. We Koreans are living in hell, under the oppressive rule of the Japanese authorities That's why l've invented Hap Ki Do, in order to gather all the courageous and ambitious young people in Korea. The aim is to end the occupation. We must forbear, so the Japanese do not know until we're ready. When you return to China, you must watch the Japanese closely. They've got Manchuria, but they won't stop at that. They want to occupy all of China, then the whole of Asia. Master... When it becomes unbearable... Here is a letter. You could call it a wise man's advice. Open it when things have become unbearable. Ying, your elder brother is honest and kind, your younger brother is brave but rash. You need to look out for them. l will do everything as Master has taught me. This discipline rod of our school is also a powerful weapon. Take it, to defend yourself. Thank you, Master. You have to set off early tomorrow. - Now go and pack. - Yes. Wait! When you set up your own school in China, remember to respect your elders, - and visit local martial arts masters. - Yes, we will. THE EAGLE SCHOOL OF HAP Kl DO, CHANG ZHOU - Let's make a few courtesy visits. - Yes. - Brother? - Yes? We'll go separately. You know the places? - Yes, we do. - Let's go. Wait! You go first. l want to have a word with Younger Brother. When you meet the other masters, remember to be polite. - Don't be brash. - l know what to do. Look! FORBEARANCE T'Al CHl SCHOOL - Young man, you're too kind. - No. You are well respected here. l had to pay my respects. The martial arts community is like a family. You've come back from Korea to set up a school here. l should be looking after you. lf you need any help, just let me know. - l will often need you to guide me. - You're too modest. Young people make great heroes. The world belongs to young people. But the situation here is a bit unusual, particularly in the martial arts world. l know you youngsters are hotheaded and you have a strong sense of justice. But you must not offend the Japanese-run Black Bear School. You should also pay them a visit, out of courtesy. Thank you for your advice. Goodbye. l'll see myself out. Please tell your brother that this old man will pay him a visit. We will need your guidance. Goodbye. SHAOLlN BOXlNG SCHOOL Why wait? We can go now. We only just met. We get along so well. What's more, you're the guest. l should buy you a drink! Come on! LlNG-LAl HOUSE RESTAURANT - Please. - Thank you. Tiger! Half a catty of wine and 20 dumplings, as usual? No, l've got a guest. Let's have something nice. We'll have beef, dried tofu, 50 dumplings. - One catty of sorghum wine. - Yes. You're too kind. Just a quick bite would do. lt's not much, really. lt's all l can afford. - l'll raise five... - l'll raise six... - ..six and... - ..seven! Drink up, drink up! - ..six, six and five... - ..three... - ..wine... - ..drink to life... - To you! - Thank you. - They've left without paying, again. - What? - Eh? - Let's go. Hey, sir! Your bill has not been paid. - On credit. - Yes, on credit. What? You can't do this. What did you say? You old bastard! - Damn them! - l hate those thugs. - Who are they? - Black Bear School. Black Bear School? They're allowed to bully people because the master is Japanese. Don't the police care? Police in the big cities are afraid, let alone a small town. l'm not afraid of them! Good! l think you should stand up for the Chinese people. Teach them a lesson! Miss Sau is here. Hello. Can l have half a catty of rice wine and a packet of peanuts, please? Little One, get the wine for Miss Sau. Miss Sau, how's your father's rheumatism? - How can it improve if he keeps drinking? - How can he stop? - Why cut out such wonderful stuff? - lndeed. Wine brings so many wonderful things, especially women... What are you doing? There are laws in this country! How dare you interfere with my business! Get him! Let's go. Hold it! You're not going anywhere. What do you want? You have to kowtow to me, nicely, three times. FORBEARANCE What's the problem? Lost your nerve? l must have been blind to choose you as my friend. lf you're afraid, leave! Why practise martial arts, if you won't uphold justice and protect the innocent? l'll deal with them myself. This hand is too naughty. Well done! Don't you dare molest ladies again! - We'll meet again soon! Be afraid! - l look forward to it! Do you have the balls to tell us who you are? Fan Wei, from Eagle School of Hap Ki Do in Chang Zhou. Let's go! Well done, Fan Wei! - This is for the damage. - Eh? We have to go. Hey, Miss Sau, your wine! l've heard that the Eagle School is run by three schoolmates. They're from Korea. - Which discipline? - Hap Ki Do. They've been visiting all the other schools today. Have they been here? lf they had a modicum of respect, they wouldn't have attacked your pupils. l'll go and trash their place. - Hold on! - And let them mock the Samurai spirit? No, the Samurai of the Great Japanese Empire is invincible. Hap Ki Do is an anti-Japanese underground group in Korea. The three of them might have been sent by the Koreans. So, we must destroy them immediately. Let's stay calm and get more information about them. Yes, we'll question them when they come to visit. What if they don't come? We'll show them what we're made of! - How do you feel now? - Much better. - Take this and come back tomorrow. - Thank you so much. - This is a little something... - We treat people for free. You're too kind. Thank you very much. - What do you want? - Do you know them? No, l don't. Sir, you are...? - He's ill. - Yes, l am ill. This way, please. May l ask you how you feel? What l have is a strange illness. l want her to treat me. All right, let me help you. - l'm in pain! - Where? My...my hair is in pain. - Your hair? - Yes. ls it possible? They're here to cause trouble. Oh...it's unbearable! l'm sorry. We only treat minor injuries, not such complicated illnesses. - So, why are you here? - That's right! - You call yourself doctors? - l can treat you. - Are you sure you can treat me? - Of course l'm sure. l guarantee instant relief. Which part is aching? Eh? Well, it hurts here. l pulled out the roots to prevent future problems, like dentists take out whatever hurts. l'll pull out some more, if the pain persists. Wait, Brother! You want to fight? Come on! Let me tell you, l'm not afraid or l wouldn't have come. Please don't be upset, it's a misunderstanding. Nonsense! You're supposed to be physicians, who treat patients. Yet you're hurting people. l've never heard of hair-ache before! - That's just your ignorance. - What did you say? l want you to put back every single strand of hair that you've removed. lt's my brother's fault. Please accept my sincere apology. You pulled out a whole bunch of hair, and think you can get away with an apology? - Let me compensate you. - That's not good enough. So, you want... lf you can't put his hair back like it used to be, you can't practise here. Take down the Hap Ki Do sign, and go away. - You son of a bitch! - Stop. The reason you're here today is to pick a fight. You've got it. Very well, in that case, l accept the challenge. Go on! - Let's go! - Quick. You know these people, don't you? - l had a fight with them yesterday. - You always get into trouble. They didn't pay their bill, they molested a girl, and they beat up Tiger of Shaolin! Are they street thugs? - They're from the Black Bear School. - The Black Bear School? - ls there such a school? - Yes. Did you visit them yesterday? - No, l didn't. - Why? Because it's a Japanese school. Big Brother, have you forgotten what the Master taught us? The martial arts community is one big family, regardless of nationality. Why should we show the Japanese respect? Wei, you mustn't say that. Now that you've gotten into trouble we've got to visit them, or it'll get worse. - Brother, get changed and go at once. - Yes, l will. - l'll go as well. - You shouldn't. You'll make the situation worse if you go. THE EAGLE SCHOOL OF HAP Kl DO, CHANG ZHOU - Take it down. - Yes. Who's the master here? - You are...? - We're from the Black Bear School. My brother is on the way to visit your school. Oh, what a coincidence! He chose this time to visit us, when we've come here. Why would l lie? You can go and see for yourself. You...! You couldn't beat a cat! With those skills, you want to teach? We're the true Hap Ki Do! What is Hap Ki Do, anyway? The Koreans are Japanese slaves. What about you? l am... l'm the chief instructor of the Black Bear School. See you there. - Let's go! - Yes. See you. Hey! Give me three catties of chicken. Fish also. l want the big ones. Three and three quarters. That'll be 36 fen. Three and a half. 75 fen will do. - On credit. - What? l said on credit! But l don't know you! How can l allow you credit? l'm from the Black Bear School. Got it? No. l don't care what school you're from. Go to hell! You're an animal. First you don't pay, then you hit me! Everyone! ls this fair? He refuses to pay, then he attacks me! How can this be right? Everyone, is this fair? - Watch where you're going! - Don't let him go! Beat him up! You refuse to pay and then you hit him! Go to hell! Bastard! These dogs must be blind. No one can survive here not knowing the Black Bear School. You won't give us credit? Let me show you what we're made of! Where are you going? My lord, please forgive us! lt won't happen again! Today l won't let those shameless beasts get away. Go and get him! You're seriously hurt. Please go to my school to be treated. - Your school? What school? - His school? Hap Ki Do. What's so great about Hap Ki Do? Master Toyoda, l'm not saying that Hap Ki Do is great. We practise it to get fit, that's all. China used to receive tributes from Korea, yet now you lower yourself to learn Hap Ki Do from Koreans! Not only that, you even help to establish them here! lt's ridiculous! Outrageous! Not really. ln the past, Japan paid China tribute as well. We Chinese aspire to a more peaceful, loving and equal world. Korea is our friend, and so is Japan. You're not our friend! Very well, goodbye! - What's this for? - You know well enough. - l'm here for a friendly visit. - And to harm us as well. See what you've done! - Nothing to do with me! - lsn't the Eagle School yours? - Who did this? - Fan Wei! Let me investigate. lf it really turns out to be Fan Wei, l'll punish him. - l won't let you off so easily. - So, what do you want? lf you can leave by this door, we'll let it rest. Don't worry, we won't gang up on you. - lt'll be one-on-one. - l'm not worried at all. l just don't want to fight. Don't push your luck! Carry him back, and give them three days to hand over the murderer! Yes! This young lady is so clever! - They say she surpasses Fan Wei. - Does she really? lt hurts! Please be careful. - lt looks bad. - Yeah. He's Fan Wei. Take this. lt'll help. Let's go! - Big Brother! - Big Brother! Don't! Let's save his life first. Get the medicine, quick! - Big Brother! - He's been badly beaten. Big Brother! What happened to his arm? He's coming round! He wants to speak. - Help me to my room. - Yes, let me carry you. - Poor man. Will he live? - l doubt it. Dear neighbours, you're all right now. Please go home and rest. - Yes, let's go home. - Come. - Big Brother, what about your injury? - lt's really bad. Even if l recover, l'll never... be able to use this arm again. - lt's all my fault. - l don't blame you. You did the right thing. A martial arts practitioner ought to help those in need, and protect the innocent. They're doing this to drive us out of Chang Zhou. They're giving us three days to hand over Wei. - What should we do? - l'll go there. l'll avenge him! Stay here! You're too impulsive. You're belligerent, and you never listen. - l don't want to get you involved. - lt's too late now, we're all involved. Let's talk and find a way out of this. Open our master's letter. See what it says. Of course! How could l forget the letter? - What does it say? - What's inside? Let me see it. FORBEARANCE Our master tells us to forbear. We'll do as we're told. But how can we hand Wei over to them? For your sake, l'll go to the Black Bear School and apologise. No, you'd be committing suicide. - Go and hide yourself away somewhere. - Hide? For now, that's the only way. We'll take our chances. Go and hide. What about the school, the clinic and the pupils? l'll take charge. Get out! Who gave you permission to study Hap Ki Do? Get out! Do you hear? Why are you being so unreasonable? We can study what we like! You have no right to interfere! - You can study anything but Hap Ki Do! - Why? Because Hap Ki Do is from Korea, colony of the Great Japan. You need permission from the Japanese authorities. This is China, not Korea! You just don't get it. Every Korean belongs to Japan. No means no. You can't study Hap Ki Do. Get out, all of you! Bastard! You Japanese dog! Hey! What, you want all these people to die in your school? Very well, l'll ask them to leave. That's right, that's a smart girl. But l need to remind you, the deadline is only two days away. Hand Fan Wei over to us, all right? l've been thinking. This is the safest place. They'll never find this place. So, bear with it, stay here for a few days. Damn it! A real man adapts to adversity. l just can't take this insult. Had it not been my master's order, l wouldn't be hiding. lt's all right, no need to lose your temper. Let me get something tasty. We'll have a nice drink together. Don't go out, OK? l'm already a coward. You think l'm going to show my face? On your way, please go to my school and tell Ying that l'm here. See if the Japanese have bothered them again. Thank you so much. Does your master know about this? Yes, he does, and his heart goes out to you. But they are Japanese. My master can't do anything. Please tell Wei to stay calm. We've already written to our master. Yes, l will. Please take this, and get some food for Wei every day. l will. l have to go now. Wait! Please tell Wei that l'll visit him tonight. l will. The saying goes, ''lf your days are numbered, nothing can change it.'' l don't think we're going to make it this time. So, you are saying... l'll go to the Black Bear School and apologise. All right, as long as they don't pursue Wei any more, we'll agree to anything they ask, for now. But you can hardly reason with the Japanese, so be careful. - No more confrontations. - l promise you l will... FORBEAR LlNG-LAl HOUSE RESTAURANT Hello, l'd like one catty of sorghum wine, 50 dumplings. - You're not eating here? - Take-away, please. - Have you won the Lottery? - No way! - l'm buying it for someone else. - Who? Fan Wei. He had a fight here last time. Him? l haven't had a chance to thank him yet. Next time he comes, the drink's on the house. - He's in trouble, he can't come. - What happened? Yesterday the Black Bear people were at it again. Wei fought and killed three of them. The Japanese are after him now, and he...is in hiding. This is... He's our hero. l can't take his money. Little One, 50 dumplings and roast beef, quick! - Right away! - Take a seat, won't be long. You really shouldn't. Tiger! Tiger, l'm looking for you. - What can l do for you? - Take me to the Hap Ki Do School. Why would you want to learn Hap Ki Do? Don't you know? Yesterday at the market, a Hap Ki Do man killed quite a few Black Bear School people. Now everyone learns Hap Ki Do to fight against the Japanese. Are you crazy? Shut up! People might hear us. Loads of people are studying Hap Ki Do. - They're in deep trouble. - What? Can l go and see him? - You'd better not. - Your dumplings, Tiger. - Your dumplings are ready. - Thank you. You killed my people, and you think a mere apology will do? What do you suggest, Master Toyoda? Hand over the murderer! What about my brother, who you almost killed? That's because he wasn't skilful enough. You bunch of idiots study rubbish like Hap Ki Do, and have the cheek to found a school in Chang Zhou? You don't know what you're doing. - How long have you studied Hap Ki Do? - Five years. - Which level? - Seventh degree. Very good, let us compete. lf you win, you're allowed to keep a school here. l'm very sorry. l've come here to apologise, not to fight. Are you scared? What is it? You're petrified, aren't you? Look at you! How can such a weakling compete with me? You'd be better off being my mistress. What a wonderful idea! You're wise not to compete with us. But l still want to see what's so great about Hap Ki Do! Come here! Yes. - You used to practise Hap Ki Do? - Yes. - Which level? - Fifth degree. He's studied Hap Ki Do. He'll fight me in your place. Watch carefully. Yes. Wow! Brilliant, marvellous! Clever! Remarkable, extraordinary! - What do you say? - Thank you, Master, for showing mercy. Master, you're indeed the best! Hap Ki Do is indeed inferior! Young lady, Hap Ki Do is such crap. - Where did you learn Hap Ki Do? - ln Korea. And you are Japanese? - Korean. - So, why are you here? Everything in Korea belongs to the Great Japan. Shouldn't l bear allegiance to Japan? Do you recognise this? This isn't Korea. l'm not going to be intimidated by a mere rod. Very well, l'll use this to purge our school of scum like you! Wait! Hold on! Let her go! Why let her go? This girl is good. l'm taking over Hap Ki Do, it'll be part of our school. - Did you see my Big Brother? - Yes, l did. You can't go out at this stage. Your brother has written to your master. - This is from your sister. - You keep it. Tomorrow... - You... - Shut up! You scumbags! Acting like bullies! l won't stand for this! Tiger! Tiger! Bring him back! Hap Ki Do is just peanuts. Hap Ki Do! l'd call the damned thing ''Crapkido''. - Let's go! - OK. Tiger! Wei! Wei! l don't think anyone will come. The martial arts community here only mind their own business. Can't blame them, really. The Black Bear School sent letters warning us Hap Ki Do was against the law. People are afraid! - ls this true? - Yes, l also got the letter. Are we all cowards? No wonder foreigners take advantage of our lack of solidarity. You mustn't say that. lt's right to keep oneself out of harm's way. Yet we have three elders here who have risked their lives to come to this meeting. We are grateful to you. Don't mention it. As we say, ''The teeth won't survive without intact lips.'' They will certainly treat us the same way as they have treated Hap Ki Do. Therefore... CHANG ZHOU HAP Kl DO, BRANCH OF BLACK BEAR SCHOOL What a lively crowd! T'ai Chi, Shaolin, Pingjin School. How come you're all here? Lady Ying, you're hosting a meeting of martial arts schools here. - Have you quite finished? - lt's none of your business. Very well, let me tell you... Master Toyoda has decided to acquire Hap Ki Do as part of Black Bear School. lt'll be called ''Chang Zhou Hap Ki Do, Branch of Black Bear School''. What's the point? We're so different. lt's in your own interests, really. Once you become part of the Black Bear School, we can stop fighting and live in harmony. You can start the classes right away. lt's for your own benefit. Please tell your master we don't deserve your interest! l'm warning you, you're going to find out the hard way. Let me be honest with you, nobody's ever disobeyed Master Toyoda. Whether you like it or not, you'll do as he says! Give it to them. Hang it up! Hang it up, now! Stop sulking. Everyone who resists will share his fate! This is outrageous! Absolutely outrageous! ls this how you martial arts people deal with these thugs? What can we do? The Japanese are behind them. lt's a crucial moment for the martial arts community in Chang Zhou. - We must fight for what's right. - Yes. - Fight tooth and nail. - No! This is Hap Ki Do business. l don't want to drag you into it. Now, please leave. l know how to deal with them! - She's the one? - l've come to see Master Toyoda. The master is not in. What do you want? l want to return something to him. What is it? You can give it to me. - Are you in charge here? - Of course! He's the head pupil. Good, take it! l've come to see Toyoda. l hold no grudge against you. l hope l won't be forced to act. You want to go just like that? ln your dreams! Stay where you are! My lady, l am...l am Chinese. l'm not...Japanese. Please...have mercy on me. Tell Toyoda, there is a limit to what Hap Ki Do will tolerate. Tell him not to push it too far. Or else...this is the best example! - Ying! - l trashed the Black Bear School! They won't accept it easily. So, we must keep a low profile. Let's go and hide, quick! - What if Master comes? - Miss Sau will contact us. Let's go! - Find them! - Yes! Master, there's nobody here. - Trash the place! - Yes, Master! Let me see if you can fly! - Secretary Zhang! - l'm here. Keep a watch on this place! Me? You want me to stay here? They'll certainly come back here. But you... But l am... l... Are you afraid of a girl? No, of course l'm not afraid! Don't worry, Brother, this is the safest place. They won't realise we're hidden here. Have you contacted Sau? l've asked her to stay at our school and wait for Master. ' l dream of... There's someone here! Go after her! Stop there! Don't run! - Where is she? No one's here. - No one. - You must have seen a ghost! - No one! Waste of time. l wonder if Master will come. Whether he comes or not, l'll fight them. We're outnumbered, we won't be able to fight them. Of course, not face-to-face combat. We need a strategy. l'll divide them up and beat them one by one. - Who's that? - lt's Sau! - Sau! What's wrong? - Ying, there are people in your school! - Who are they? - lt's that scum, Secretary Zhang! You stay here, l'll have a look. - Be careful! - l will. Let's go. You! Grab her! - Lock the doors! - Yes. Don't kill me. l beg you...have mercy on me. You scumbag! You've caused so many deaths! Today it's your turn to die! Please, spare me! - Ying! - Let's go. - Ying! - Don't be afraid, open the door, go! - Who's there? - l'm from Korea. Head Brother! Head Brother! Where's your brother? He's injured, disabled. l have him hidden somewhere else. - Sau, tell him Head Brother's here. - OK. Who did this to you? Damned Japanese! l didn't expect them to do this to Chinese people as well. How is Master? ls he well? The Japanese have discovered our organisation in Korea. Our people were either killed or forced to flee. What about Master? He's been captured by the Japanese. Head Brother, our countries, our people have had enough. We must rid China and Korea of this devil! What do you want? Why can't you leave a disabled man alone? Shut up, bitch! Go away! Go, quick! Tell my sister! Don't let him go! - Let's go! - Yes. - Who is he? - He's my Head Brother. Chief instructor at the Headquarters of Hap Ki Do in Korea. Why don't you stay in Korea and devote yourself to Japan? - What are you doing here? - Toyoda, beware! Today, the Chinese and the Koreans take revenge on you! Bitch, shut your trap! You're dead meat! You shameless dog! A Chinese man, you'd rather slave for the Japanese and bully your own countrymen! Tell me, where's your conscience? Get them! Let me deal with him! l'll avenge my brothers! Head Brother, how are you feeling? l'm all right. Let's get out of here.
