[SKATEBOARD ROLLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Calendar says it's your big day. Cell 16. [DOOR BUZZER] Something wrong with your hand? No [CLEARS THROAT] [DOOR BUZZER] [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, Barrows. If I was going swimming today, are you still too chicken to get in the pool, huh? BULLY: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yo, don't. he doesn't know how to swim. He might drown, huh? TAB: Give them back. Just hang on a second, Barrows. We want to make sure you're getting a good education, buddy. TAB: Hey, give it to me. BULLY: What's this [INAUDIBLE]? Look at me, guys, I'm Supergirl. Come here, man. [LAUGHTER] BULLY: Open up, give me some more. SCHMITTY: You just broke the law, buddy. Schmitty? Littering on city streets can cost you a fine or community service. Uh. I'm just screwing with you, James. How the hell have you been, man? Listen, I just finished my shift. Let me buy you a drink. JAMES: Shouldn't you be dealing with that? Bye. BULLY: Come here. TAB: Stop it. Is that good Barrows? He likes it. He likes it. [MUSIC PLAYING] [EXPLOSION] Hey, do you know where I can find Julie Gardner? SUSIE: James? It's Susie Schmidt. Schmitty told me you were back in town. It's great to see you. It's multiple sclerosis, James. You can't catch it. JAMES: Right, no, I-- uh, yeah. I'm so sorry about your dad. My dad? Well, yeah, I mean, isn't that why you're back? Well, what happened to my father? He had a stroke, James. I think he's still in the ICU. My god, didn't Werber tell you? No, he didn't. Susie, we'll, uh, we'll talk soon. [MAGIC SOUND] [VIDEO GAME NOISES] [CONTROLLER CLATTERS] FATHER: Shoot. [GROAN] How long you been standing there? I was hoping to be there to pick you up when they let you out, but, uh-- Yeah. Come on in. Sit down. Tell your old man a few lies about how much you missed him. What kind of blockage did you have? Your brother's taking good care of me. [SNORT] How long you been in town? Uh, I just-- just got here. And you rushed right over to see your old man, huh? Yeah. You're a lousy liar, James. James. James! Ah, shoot. [VOMITING] [DOOR OPENS] Now, that's just how I remember you, little brother. James. I'm so-- James. Julie. Hi. Hi. Uh, you have-- It's vomit. I, I, I-- I tried to get you some messages at the-- Yeah, uh. I don't mean to interrupt here. I just got to say something real quick. There's a conference in Chicago this weekend. I thought we could use it as our little getaway, you know? Sure, I just have to check my schedule. I say cancel whatever you've got, and I'll get us a room by the lake. [PHONE RINGING] Yep? [DOOR OPENS] James. Jimbo, wait up. Do me a favor and let's not make a big deal out of this, please. We were engaged. I know. And then you were in-- let's just say, you left. This thing with Julie, it's [CLEARS THROAT] new, OK? It's brand new. Just don't screw it up for me, please. [SIGH] And by the way, I know you could probably use a couple hundred. [SIGH] I know. Here, just take this. I insist. All right. Welcome home. -Hey listen, Werber. I got to ask you for a favor. I need a job. All right, just something to tide me over until Dad gets back on his feet. Right. I was kind of hoping to find something here at the hospital. I don't know, James. I mean, with your history-- Don't you mean my record? Yeah, well, look. All right, I'll, uh-- I can talk to human resources, OK? Seriously, let me, let me, ask around. I'll see what I can-- see what I can do. All right. And by the way, you're going to have to tell me the story behind this whole thing sometime, please. Not tonight, I'm-- I'm a little booked, but-- and, uh, you know what I was going to ask you, I'm thinking of putting a little more gray in around the temples. I think that would make me look more distinguished. How do you think it would make me look? Fat. Fat? Come on. Always the wise-ass. I love you. NURSE: Rise and shine, Mr. Clark. [MUSIC PLAYING] Come on, Dad. Let's go. I love you, hotshot. Love you too, Dad. Come on. [THUNDER] [RAIN] [DOG WHIMPERING] KID: It's OK, he won't hurt you. Up here. Come, Chlorian. [FART] I named him Chlorian. It's from Star Wars. It's where the Force comes from. Is there a reason you're sitting on my garage? My name is Tab, like the pop. My parents didn't want me to have a name that could be changed into a nickname. What's your name? Listen, kid. You should probably learn not to talk so much. Maybe then, you wouldn't keep getting your ass kicked by your buddies at school. Unless, of course, you like eating comic books. Keep Chlorine out of my yard. -It's Chlorian. [WIND HOWLING] [CRACK] [GASPING] James! I didn't see you there. How's your arm feeling today, Suzie? Actually, I was just calling a nurse. A nurse can't help you. And there's no one here that's going to be able to explain why you can use your arm today. It just started yesterday. After I touched you? Yeah. You know it doesn't have to stop there? What do you mean? My MS can't be reversed. And they probably also told you you'd never regain feeling in that arm again. -Yeah, they did. And you're paying a deductible with your insurance here, right? Yeah, but-- Good. Let me tell you how this is going work. [MACHINE BEEPING] [GROAN] [BREATHING HEAVY] James. Schmitty? Suzie just told me you said you'd cure her MS for $2500. What's wrong with you? Why would you do that? I thought that's all she could afford. Do you know what it's like not to be able to walk? Yeah, actually, I do. You know what, James. Go to hell. You want to go back to prison, you keep it up. And stay away from Suzie. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, how come I've never seen you around here before? (LOUDLY) How come I've never-- I heard you the first time. So how come I've never seen you around here before. [SIGH] I've been on vacation. My mom said that your dad's in the hospital. She said he had a stroke. Hey, did you know that my grandmother is in the hospital, too? But she didn't have a stroke. She's just old. Anyway, she has cancer and I think she's probably going to die. -(SARCASM) Wow, that sucks. Now if you don't mind? What are you doing? I'm gardening. Why? Because it's a garden. It doesn't look like a garden. It looks like weeds. Hey, what's your name? It's James. Wait, this is the Bond house. Your name is James Bond? My parents named me after a pop. So, what did you used to plant in your garden? Nothing. It was my mother's. Did she tell you clean it up? Look, kid, let's make a deal, OK? You stay on your roof. I will stay-- [GATE OPENS] What are you doing here? Me? I'm just picking up your dad's mail. Uh, you want to stay for beer or something? No. You know, I can do that. I can pick up the mail. I can pay the bills. You don't need to-- [LAUGHTER] -OK. You know, I had a long day at the hospital. But now that I know that you're doing whatever it is you're doing, I am going to go home, take a shower, and go to bed. What? You knew I was going to be here, didn't you? Are you kidding? Oh, come on, admit it. Come on, you knew I was here, right? Ju-- in three years, you haven't thought about me? JULIE: Goodnight, James. [CAR STARTS] Julie, come on. Come on. Shoot. [PHONE RINGING] WERBER (ON ANSWERING MACHINE): Oh, hey, little brother. So listen, I pulled some strings and I got you a job at the hospital. It's a, it's a janitor's position, but beggars can't be choosers, right? And hey, I smoothed it out, so they won't ask you about your, you know, prison record. It's good to have you back, buddy. By the way, you're welcome. [DOG BARKING] Damn it. Ahhhh, God. Oh, keep your freaking Star Wars dog off the lawn, Tab. How'd you make him bark? The vet said he never would bark, some virus or something. Yeah, well, he doesn't have much trouble with the other end. Get a shovel and clean this up. Hey, did you plant these yesterday? [MUSIC PLAYING] You know, my mom said smoking will kill you. It helps if you start young. James. Oh, Schmitty, come on, man. I just want to go see my dad. No, I don't-- it's, uh-- Look at you. You just did that. Yeah. They want to run some tests on her. Let 'em. How did-- what did you do? [MUSIC PLAYING] [WIND HOWLING] [GASPING] TAB: Are you a gamer? Are you a gamer? What did you just call me? Graphic novels? Hey. TAB: Do you like anything? -Privacy. Everyone said that you fixed Ms. Schmidt. I think I know how you did it. Oh, yeah? Yeah, you're some kind of superhero. Are you a superhero? If I say yes, will you get the hell out of here? You know, you probably shouldn't swear. You're supposed to be a role model. Can I see that comic? Yeah. [MUSIC PLAYING] Damn. [SIRENS] [KNOCKING] GRIGG: Come. -Hey. I'm the new guy. What, you need me to fill out more paperwork or something? Put this on. It's the only clean one we got. None of this sanitary engineer shit. We're janitors, you got it? Something gets dirty, we clean it. Something gets broke, we fix it. Get into your uniform and get to work. Perfect. Are you here with more light, Cindy? For my reading lamp, I need better light to work on my little hobby. -I'll get you a brighter bulb. -Thank you. Look, let me ask you a question, Mrs. Barrows. Are you happy with your treatment here? I beg your pardon? Well, judging by your progress, whatever they're doing for you isn't working so well. I don't understand. Are you with the medical staff? Maybe it's time you tried something else. What are you talking about? I'm talking about the way a woman within MS walked out of here. Look, you have an aggressive stage of ovarian cancer. A first-year med student would be able to tell you, you don't have much time left. Who are you? I can fix that. -I'm calling the nurse. -Ms. Barrows-- -That's enough! -There's a man, here in the ICU. His name is Mr. Clark. Now, his chart says he sleeps 20 hours a day. He's in pain the other four. I just want you watch him, carefully. I'll be back. [MUSIC PLAYING] [HEART BEATING] [BAR MUSIC] What can I get you? Uh, I'll have a beer. I don't mean to pry, but can I ask you a question? You're the guy who fell from One Fall, right? Yeah. It must be 200 feet. How long were you in the hospital? Look, it's just that everyone is saying you fell from the cliff and then walked away like after week. Is a true? No. It was four days. Complements of the gentleman in the corner. It's cute. So what is this, a peace offering? You should follow her back. Go, and don't let her see you. Look, I don't know what kind of sick stuff you're into, old man, OK, but I'm not going back to jail. Hey, we're not here to pluck chickens. Go. [COUGHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Have they checked her heart rate lately? No. Can I get you anything from the vending machine? Mr. Clark, what are you doing out of bed? Well, I'll just surprise you. What the hell was that? You do this? You did a crappy job of sewing that up. What, you're going to stay up there all night? Yuck, you like this stuff? It's an acquired taste. What's your story, anyway? I mean, don't you have parents? Don't you get a bedtime or something? I don't sleep so well. You don't sleep so well. Join the club. What, comic books giving you nightmares? You know, yesterday, for a while there, I really thought you might, you know, the way you fixed Ms. Schmidt, making the flowers bloom. It's just like they talk about in the comic books. It was like you had real superpowers or something. So what makes think I don't? I mean, come on. I fixed Ms. Schmidt. I fixed chlorine. Chlorian. Whatever, look kid-- My name is Tab and you're supposed to do things because it's the right thing to do, not because people pay you. Yeah, well I'm sure that's really convenient in Gotham City, OK? But Batman's a billionaire. Charity don't pay. -My grandma's going to die. -Yeah. That sucks. Did you ever know anyone who died? See that car? You know I was born in that car? Yeah, my parents didn't make it to the hospital. And my dad, he delivered me right there in the backseat. That's why he didn't junk it after the crash. We all lose people, kid. [BURP] [BELCH] [MUSIC PLAYING] Where the hell is everybody? They're in the lounge, playing cards. They're in the lounge. Isn't that nice? What is this? We're having trouble getting them to take their meds. Having trouble? Well, they don't want to take them. Well, that's what suppositories are for. How you feeling? Like a grown man who needs help to pee. [LAUGHTER] Come on, Cliff. Stroke recovery is complicated. Yeah. You know, I was just thinking, I taught the boys to fly fish not far from here. Yeah? Same place my grandfather used to take me fishing when I was young. Victoria and I wanted the boys to have those kind of memories, good memories. Well, as soon as you are feeling better, I think a fishing trip with the Bond boys will do everyone some good. Yeah. It's OK. I don't mind if you lie. You get used to them over the years. They used to be so much alike, my boys. Well, I guess I don't have to tell you that. [LAUGHTER] Then after Victoria's accident, I don't know. I look at them now, I hardly recognize the men my boys have become. I think Warber-- God, I love Werber, I do. Are you trying to convince or you? I just-- I keep looking for the James I knew. And? I think the boy I love never made it off that cliff. That boy never came home to any of us. One thing is for sure. My boys have good taste. [LAUGHING] [CRYING] I understand you taught my grandson to drink beer. He looks up to you, you know. [TOILET FLUSHES] I'm done in here. I thought about what you said. The way that woman with MS suddenly got better and Mr. Clark. I'm not too proud to admit that I'm a little scared of my future. [MUSIC PLAYING] You want me to help you? I don't trust you. It doesn't work on trust. That's what my grandson says. He thinks you're some kind of hero, you know. Look, I assume you have some kind of retirement money stashed away? James, what are you doing? What in God's name did I just hear? Have you been telling a terminal patient that she could pay you, and you'd make her better? What are you, insane? Or just stupid? I mean, I know you don't have an awful lot of respect for yourself, but you damn well better respect this hospital. My God, and by the way, remember you're a janitor, and not a doctor. You walked away from that years ago. Yeah, go ahead, walk away. Hey what's the matter? Going away to jail wasn't enough for you? You had to come back here and screw everything up for rest of us? And another thing-- are you aware that I've got patients in the ICU who are off their meds because of you? I'm just a janitor, Werber. Oh, don't I know it. Because if you were doctor, you'd know that 48%-- 48%-- of stage 2 ovarian cancer patients go into remission? Why are you yelling at me? --Because I'm a good doctor, that's why. And if my patients continue to ignore what I prescribe for them, then they're all just going to start getting sick again, or worse. And that's going to be because of you. What's going on, here, Werber? No, seriously, what is this? Is the great Dr. Bond jealous, because his little brother can do something better than he can. Is that what this is about? Don't be ridiculous. You've never been able to do anything better than me in your life, ever. Listen, sooner or later, you're going to have to acknowledge the fact that these people are walking around because of me, not you. See, unlike you, I can actually heal people. Oh, really? Well, why don't you start by healing yourself? Oh, that's disgust-- Oh my. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, that hurt, you jerk. [GROAN] Sorry, it's OK. It's my brother. [LAUGHING] [COUGHING] Oh, great. [SIGH] Uh, Cindy? I wondered if you had a moment before you left? Good. Let me tell you how this is going to work. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, Julie. The years have been good to you. JULIE: You know, they arrest perverts in this town. Hey, come on, it's nothing I haven't seen before. Besides, I was almost a doctor. Well then, enjoy the view. [BREATHING DEEPLY] Mr. Clark, if I have to ask you one more time about the legs-- please, stop. [KNOCKING] NURSE: Mr. Bond, I think you need to come see this. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] [BED SQUEAKING] What's the matter? I think Mrs. Lazenby's hip is better. [MOANING] [BAR MUSIC] MAN (OFFSCREEN): I need to ask you a question. Who's was driving the vehicle? I was. [DOOR CLOSES] [MUSIC PLAYING] [GLASS BREAKING] Hey, are you all right? CLAIRE: It's okay. My back gave out. I was trying to lift this stuff into the dumpster. I can fix you. James. Just, stop. James, this isn't cool. Just stop. James, please don't James, stop. [CRYING] -What the? -Hey! CLAIRE: Please don't. [GRUNT] Say something, damnit. What is this? Damnit, you better start talking, buddy. Or I swear to God, I'll kill you where you stand. -What's going on here? -He was trying to rape Claire. He didn't try to rape me. Don't you know she's sick. Go. Get away from us, now. [MUSIC PLAYING] Werber, slow down. You're not making any sense. What the? Oh my God, it's James. I'll call you back. James? James. Say something. Say something. Ow. Stay still. That's pretty deep. See, I think you might have tapped into something, James-- the healing power of suggestion. Whoa. Positive thinking. What are you talking about? Well, I've got investors lined up to, you know, help me get my clinic started. It's going to be like the Mayo Clinic, only more exclusive. Why are you telling me this? Because I think you should join me. I mean, think of everything we could do, James. All the people we could help: families, babies, fathers, mothers. [GROAN] That's the best I can do. James. Are you OK? It's more dangerous in there. Your car is still at the bar. I can give you a ride. They really did a number on you. You all right? Oh, I've had worse. Three years is a long time. No phone calls. No letters. You know, it wasn't just me you left. Why did you come back to One Fall? Ow. You can get out now. [MUSIC PLAYING] [WIND HOWLING] Can I come in for a sec? You need the right uniform. I've been doing some research, and here are some options for you. Is that your breakfast? See, you can go with this kind, because it really fits your personality, I think. Look, Tab. Shouldn't you be in school or something? But we haven't even gotten to the cape yet. Right. OK. Did you see my cigarettes? Yeah, I threw them out. You what? Superheroes don't smoke. Go to school. Take underdog with you. That's good. You doing fine. I want to make you a preposition. Let's just focus on walking. I got a bottle of whiskey in my room. It's so smooth, it'll make you tear up and cry. You shouldn't be drinking. Flush. Woo! I love this game. Not while I'm in here. I'm want you to help me drain it when I get out. [BREATHING] With you, handsome? Any time. But for now, let's just focus on the walking. -Was that Mrs. Barrows? -Uh-huh. I thought she was terminal. [SPLASHING] Hey, Barrows. Gonna play drown the shithead. Want to join us? Oh, did I get you wet? I'm sorry. Loser. Hey, Grigg. Yeah, I got a question about some of these cleaning supplies. [SPLASHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] JAMES: Hey, Julie. [LAUGHTER] Steaks, huh? Thank you. What happened, James? You were a promising med student. You had so much going for you. But to end up in jail for-- Deformation of a corpse. I was over in Waterville. I was drunk. You know, I had been wandering around for a while. And uh, there was this girl. She couldn't been more than 20. She was on her cellphone, talking to her mom or dad, boyfriend. So what happened? Um, a bus blew the light. So that night I broke into the Waterville morgue. And I tried to fix her. Fix her-- how did you think you could fix her, James? She was dead. Something happened to me, Julie, the night that I fell off that cliff. Look, you want to know why I left this town? I left because God, the universe, whatever you want to call it, it has a sense of humor, and it's messed up. Whatever happened to me, it happened too late for me to save my mother. She sat in that car and she bled to death, because-- [SIGH] Look, I know how this sounds. It sounds like you're getting ready to make an excuse for why you ran away from everyone who loved you. And there were a lot of people here who loved you, but if what you are saying is true, then why don't you just go march right into your father's room and make it all better. Why don't you go fix him? Something's wrong. Werber is really upset. And he spoke with Schmitty, and people are talking about you like-- like you can walk on water or something. Would that convince you? What? If I walked on water? James, come on. Oh. [MUSIC PLAYING] No. Hey, hey. I'm contemplating, hold on. You're going to hurt yourself. Oh my God. [LAUGHING] It's always the last step, isn't it? [SIGH] [MACHINE BEEPING] [GLASS BREAKING] Ow. [HEART THUMPING] People run from me. Don't you get it? These kids at school took off when I came near them. I made them run. This is fantastic. I think I'm going to call myself Repeller Boy. It's not a superpower, kid. It just means you're irritating. Hey, what happened to your hand? Nothing It's just-- I was visiting my father. So why don't you heal it? Have you picked a name, yet? For what? Your superhero name? It's just as important as the costume. Hey, what's wrong with that one? You're a terrible superhero. JULIE: James. Hey, you got a minute. JULIE: Not right now, actually. This isn't a good time to talk. Julie, Julie I need to talk to you, OK? Not-- not right now. I know that sleeping with you was a mistake, OK? It's just that-- I mean, you felt so good. I'm sorry. I'm just dying to hear how you finish that sentence. How did it feel, James? Hmm? I'd like to know myself. Werber, I can explain. Don't bother, Jules. Very disappointed. Very-- Werber, I-- -Julie, let him go. -No. Werber-- WERBER: Walk away. Rise and shine, Mr. Clark. Don't you have your card game today? Mr. Clark? [DOG BARKING] [COUGHING] I figured something out. Your dog is drinking beer. Oh. Your hand didn't heal after seeing your dad. You cut it while he was there, right? So? Don't you see, James? It's just like Martian Man Hunter and his vulnerability to fire. English, please. Do you know about Green Lantern and the color yellow? Superman and kryptonite? Tab, what are you talking about? It's a simple superhero formula. They all had weaknesses, a vulnerability. The more time you spend around your dad, the weaker your powers. That's ridiculous, Tab. I've spent years around him. He's my father. But not since the fall. That's why the garden's dying. That's why everyone's getting sick. Don't you see? If you don't find a way to get past this, I think they're all going to die. And if you don't get out of One Fall, I think that means you too. That's ridicul-- [COUGHING] [SPITS] -Oh, damn. Yeah, so why can't you heal yourself? Haven't you wondered why your dad hasn't even gotten a little bit better while you're around? OK. So how does Superman get past his kryptonite thing, in the comics? Well, actually he can't. But don't you see, James. If you find a way to get past this, you'll be doing something that even Superman can't even do. I mean, it'll be like saving a man made of kryptonite. You want to know my professional opinion. You should just leave this town. I mean, no offense, but look at you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Come on, Dad. Mom's already in the car. How much have you had to drink? You better drive. You're supposed to be a role model, you know? You know, I love you, hotshot. Love you too, Dad. Yeah, I know. I will drive safely. [MUSIC PLAYING] [FOOTSTEP] You know, I was just standing here thinking about med school. Mine, not yours. Are you still going to open that clinic? Why? I think I would like to reconsider my answer. [LAUGHTER] You know, I think you need to come with me, little brother. I'll drive. [MACHINE BEEPING] Susie's had a bit of a relapse. They're all sick again, James. All of them, Mrs. Barrows. Everyone on this ICU, just like I said they would be. Which is why I have taken the liberty of sending in your letter of resignation. But I've also done you the favor of not reporting your actions to the police. But, from here on in, if I see anywhere near this hospital, I'll have no reservations about having your ass arrested for endangering the lives of my patients. You understand me? -Warber-- No, listen. Sorry, Jimbo. This is how it has to be. How's your girl? She's hanging in there. Your buddy's out in the hall, waiting for you. Tom, I think it's best if you just disappeared for a while, kind of like the last time you left town. But this time, don't come back. You know what I mean? Schmitty, I-- [GROAN] [COUGHING] [BAR MUSIC] What's happening to me, Grigg? You know, I watch you every day trying to finish the job you started up there. You see, I don't think there's anything accidental about you falling off that cliff. I know that whatever happened when you took that leap, it should have killed you. But instead, it put something right in you. And look at you. That rock has taken a lot of lives in this town. So my question stands, why you? I don't know. Yeah, I know you don't, but maybe it's time for you to find out. It's time for you to make a choice. I'm no hero. Do you know what the difference between a hero and a coward is? Both are scared. Neither wants to do what needs to be done. But in the end, the hero does it anyway. MAN (OFFSCREEN): I need to ask you a question. Who was driving the vehicle? I was. [MACHINE BEEPING] Hey, hotshot. I wanted to talk you. Come on in. I can hear you fine from here, Dad. All right. Well, suit yourself. You know, I always did my best for you, James. I hoped that I would be able to give you a chance at life, a future. Now, it looks like I'm the one that's not going to have a future. I love your brother. He's a very smart man, but he's not making me any better. I'm getting worse. And I don't want to try things his way anymore. You understand what I'm asking you? I don't know what it is you do, light incense, or flip tarot cards. I don't give a shit if it's a goddamn magic eight ball. I need you to help me. [HEART THUMPING] (WHISPERS) I can't. I am so sorry about what happened, what happened that night. But I can't change that, James. I lied for you. I lied for you every day for three years about who was driving that car. I can't help you. I have some money put away for retirement. Oh, Dad. How much do you want? Dad. OK. Maybe you should just go. Just-- just go. [GROAN] I was supposed to die. [GROAN] Why? Why couldn't you just let me die? TAB: Who you talking to you? Oh, shit. Tab, what are you doing here? I don't sleep so well. You don't-- right. -Are you OK? -No. I can't do this. Superheroes are not supposed to just-- Stop. Stop! I am not a superhero. Can you get that through your skull? Go home, Tab. Just leave me alone. Oh, Tab. Tab, what are you doing? Tab. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, crap. Tab! [COUGHING] See? You saved me. Get a super suit. It'll help. [CAR STARTS] [MACHINE BEEPING] [HEART THUMPING] Werber, we need to talk. Have you seen James? No, but I just received his resignation. You wouldn't happen to have anything to do with that, would you? He's not the guy we used to know, Julie. Cliff? I think you owe me a drink, sweetie. Dad, hold on, please. Just wait, one second. Listen to me. I'm going fishing. You want to join me? [STAMMERS] I haven't fished since I was-- You got a light? [PHONE BUZZING] Dad. Dad, hold-- Dad. Dad. Dad. God! Isn't somebody supposed to be fixing these things? James. Julie? What the hell did you do to him? He thought you healed him, you bastard. [MACHINE BEEPING] -Shit. I need [INAUDIBLE] now. Hey, Dad. It's Werber. I'm here. You're OK. You're having a stroke, here. Dad, come back to me. Come back. Look at me. It's Werber. [GROAN] -James. [GASPING] What did you think you were going to do? You put all these lives in danger? You put his life in danger. And now you've killed him! I'm calling the police to make sure they put you away for this. And this time, nobody's going to be around to take the blame for you. James. James. James, what happened? Was your dad OK?
