In the beginning... There was the soulless creator, Demiurge... Idea, the true figure of the world... and only shapeless chaotic souls had existed in the entire universe. Demiurge does not know of the existence that created him. Nor the existence of the soul. Nor even of Idea. The world he created was merely a shadow of the true world... Investigations as to the cause of the mass blackouts in Kawasaki Area are underway. However the cause is still unknown. Hey, Taichi. Wake up. Taichi! Taichi. Time to get up. Come on. You'll be late for training in the morning. Is that the time? See you! Take care. My wings are full of images of holding back They are still weak but I'm sure I can fly Oh My Love I become a happy butterfly and fly on the shimmering wind And I will go to see you right away Better you forget about unnecessary things There's no time to joke anymore I wonder what will reach the sky But don't even have a plan for tomorrow Living in the world of nothing after the infinite dream My love to you is growing weak My wings are holding back They are still weak but I'm sure I can fly Oh My Love I become a merry butterfly and fly on a swift breeze And I will go to see you anywhere in the world "Ambiguous words are actually handy" The lyrics of a hit song I'm listening to Good. Let's keep going! You're lusty. Let's just take a rest. Oh, Hikari? Taichi, you forgot your lunch. Sorry about that. Thank you. You owe me a convenience store ice-cream. Strawberry Choco Bomber Crash seasonal Hyper Tropical Espresso. Ah, okay, sure. Taichi! Next set! You guys wanted to rest. We've no time to rest! Our only direction is forward, right Hikari-san? What? Well... Yes. Good luck with your training. This Sunday? Yeah. Oh, good morning. Morning. Hey. Good morning, Yagami. G... good morning, sir. You still haven't brought it? Yeah, well... Sorry, sir. You're the only one left. You're unbelievable. Come to my office at lunch time. Well? Yes sir, I understand. What's that about? My career planning form. You still haven't handed it in? No. You'd better get it soon. Sure. We're playing a gig. Wanna come? TEEN-AGE WOLVES? We broke up and changed the name. To what? KNIFE OF DAY. Why did you split up? I guess you could say musical difference. Oh, really? Musical... You wanna make me vomit? I'm having a gorgeous lunch. Sunday? I have a soccer game. Right. Okay then. Pass it over. Stop. This is a special treat for you. Cut it out! Stop being stupid. You need the right amount of pepper. I'm particular about my ramen... That's just like you, KNIFE OF RAMEN. Shut up! Well, what's your plan, Yagami? You must have some idea. My future? Nothing special... Oh, sorry. Sir, do you mind if I have this? You've bitten into it! Go ahead. Thank you, sir! Is there nothing you're interested in? There must be something. Not really, sir. Just put anything down. I like being with my friends. But they live too far away to see them. I used to go there regularly. "OVERSEAS" Kind of like that, sir. Then maybe you should study languages. There are many schools. Then find your field once you're there. Dream big, boy! Koshiro! Sorry. I appreciate it but that's my parents' wedding anniversary. So you can't come? How about Yamato-san? He has a concert that day. And I can't really ask Joe since he's studying for his exams. I'm going to ask Hikari and Takeru, but who knows... It's hard to get everyone together these days. That's okay. I just figured you might be free so I asked. Oh, I know. I'll text Mimi-san, just in case. But she's over in America. No way she can come. Never. But it's Mimi. She could get here with unexpected ease. I wonder how she's doing over there? She replied. That was fast. Hello! Thanks for the invite. I'll come, so cover my airfare, okay? Mimi What? She's coming? Round-trip weekend airfares from NY to Tokyo aren't cheap. Full fare is 1.08 million yen. Plus, all major airlines slap on extra fees. Things like fuel surcharges. They're added to the base price. Here's a comparative fare chart of all the airlines. But one thing. It's Mimi, so we'd better check business-class fares. Forget it. Sorry, I'm busy Sunday. So you can't come? I'm taking a friend to my brother's concert. You're taking a girl? Yeah. Oh, you're a real babe-magnet, Takeru-kun. It's not that. She's just a friend. I bet. What was that? Nothing special. Come on. Are you jealous, Hikari? Not a chance. If no one turns up, he'll be disappointed. My brother is actually hoping that they can attend his concert. Really? He'd never admit to it, though. We sure have our hands full with them. Some other time. Sure, bye bye. "PREP SCHOOL" Seating will be based on your results from the recent test. Top marks start from the front. Here, 4th row back is for D grade students. Those at the back need to work harder. I'm in the 4th row... "Sorry can't go. Have to study for entrance exams." Yes, witnesses are starting to appear. I understand. No attacks so far, but not for long. Be careful. "NO SIGNAL" Damn. Reports of recent widespread blackouts in the Kanto region... Sorry I can't make it. Don't worry about it. Someone's birthday, right? Yes. It's also been suggested that there could be a connection between... ...the close emergence times and locations of the frequent electrical interferences. Taichi... Forget it. I know you're all too busy to come see me play. So, you do mind. No way! You do. There's no mistake. Or rather, maybe you're disappointed? Not over something like that, no way. Thanks. Wait! Look... Beaming freshness! You must try! What? Nothing. Forget it. Good luck with the game. "To: Sora Takenouchi" "Sub: Today" "Are you going to Yamato's concert?" why ask?" "I have a soccer game." "Kickoff is 2pm at the Daibacho Ground." "Come if you have time..." Sorry, we'll soon be out of your way. Taichi should've asked me earlier. Then I'd have time to get ready. Soccer is from 2pm, so even if I rush... It'll take 30 mins to get to the concert venue. Oh no! What do I do? Leave right after the game and... When does Yamato's band play their set? If they're first, I'll never make it in time. What if I go see them first? What's wrong with me? Get it together! Why do they put me on the spot like this? Enough. I won't go to either of them. I won't! I'm running late! What? What's going on? That must be a good sign! No it's not! Where's my cell phone? Excuse me. It's me, Sora. Sora-san? Sorry. Is this a good time to talk? Forget that. Is this an emergency? Yes, it really is. Yes, okay. I've got that. Onion soup, please. My phone is acting weird. That sounded like English. Maybe crossed lines. The same thing's happened before. It starts with communications in the digital realm. Duck Breast in Orange Sauce and oolong tea for her. Please. It's no good. I don't get it. I'll call you back. Hey, Sora-san? Hello? Tickets are selling well. They all look excited about seeing your new band. What do you call yourselves? Not the TEEN-AGE WOLVES...? KNIFE OF DAY. What? That's weird. "#%% Y gtr'DX$" What's going on? I told you to bring your sister no matter what. What was I supposed to do? She has plans. Look. What's that? Hey, Taichi! What? Hey, are you there? Why? I can't get through. Mom, it's acting weird. What's going on here? Why is Kuwagamon here?! It will be open until the end of the month. We've just received breaking news. An unidentified creature was spotted flying over Odaiba, Tokyo. That area also reports major electrical interference. Issues with traffic lights and trains are causing major delays and confusion. No way, could it be... I think so. Look, about today's concert. It may get canceled. Sorry about that. Catch you later. Your girlfriend? Don't worry. I still love you the most. What are you talking about? Don't be stupid. I can't get through to Taichi. I guess he's playing soccer now. Hello? Look, about the concert. Excuse me, may I have another Oolong tea? Why now? How come? "#%%DSD" "DyY gtr'DXM" "Y gtr'DXM" I'm ruined. "NO SIGNAL" There! I don't believe this. No chance. Alone, I'm powerless. Taichi. Agumon! Long time no see! Taichi, you have grown up. And you've shrunk. No time to talk! Agumon, we must stop this rampage. Got it! Agumon evolution! Greymon! Taichi! It's much stronger than the last time we fought. How come? I'll stop him anyway. We're counting on you, Greymon! They disappeared! Greymon! Hey! Where are you? Hikari? Big problems here. According to the news, Digimons were seen at Haneda Airport. Haneda? But, how can I get to Haneda? Listen Hikari, you need to... Need to what? No, forget it. Thanks, that helps. Don't hang... Yagami! Mr. Nishijima? Get in! Miss Hikari Yagami? What's going on? What's the problem? Control, this is Benten Bridge. Control, roger. Over. The site is blocked. Call for the special unit. What exactly are you...? Th... thank you sir. CODE-01, dispatched, sent under escort. We're counting on you, the DigiDestined. Greymon! Greymon! Taichi! You're all here. You don't get it, right? Neither do we. They suddenly grabbed me. We just got here. You too, Patamon? Before we knew it, we were here. Are you okay, Taichi? We'll help you. We need to confront the enemy first. Right, let's do it. Wait a minute. Where's Mimi? Joe isn't here, either. Oh no! Why won't Taichi-san take my call? I flew all the way from America. Haneda? There's no signal here. Mimi, where are you? Greymon! No way. Three of them? Agumon! Damn it! Gabumon! Yo! Gabumon evolution! Garurumon! Are you okay, Agumon? Yeah. No, they're splitting up. Let's do the same. Damn! That was close. We can't let them get away. - Biyomon! - Let's go. Biyomon evolution! Birdramon! Nice! Let's go help. It's showtime! Tentomon evolution! Kabuterimon! We must catch them. Stop them here. Okay, Takeru! Leave it to me, Hikari! Patamon evolution! Angemon! Mimi, hurry up. I can't evolve by myself. I'll go get Joe. Passengers and crew have begun evacuating Haneda Airport. So this must be it... You're blocking the TV. The news from Haneda? No need to watch it. I'm taking you there now. What? Welcome back, Miss Mimi Tachikawa. They did it! Are all of them there? How many? Is Palmon there, too? 'Cause I have to give souvenirs to all of them. This is good! I was wondering how to hand them out. It's disappeared. There's one left. Get up Garurumon! What was that? No idea. Is it over? I'm glad we managed to beat them. Yes, but look. There's so much damage. Who are those guys? The way they escorted us and their post-handling is too professional. I asked, but they wouldn't answer. So much has happened, I don't know what's going on. We're totally lacking information. Actually, Mr. Nishijima is the one who brought me here. From our school? He must be with them. Then maybe we can get some answers from him. Maybe. Palmon! Hello, everybody! It's Mimi! Long time no see! It's lovely! - Mimi! - Mimi-san! Did you miss me? You're back? You came back for this battle? No, that's not it. I was planning to return anyway. Then I heard about Taichi's soccer match. Yes, that reminds me. Souvenirs for all! The gummi candy I'm addicted to recently. Weird colors but you can't stop eating them. Mimi's choice! Here, Agumon. That'll cheer you up. Delicious! Me, too. One for me. Eat your fill, I have plenty. I will! One for me, too. Me, too! There's plenty for everyone. Thank you. But how do we get back home? My driver is waiting over there. Who is she, anyway? She looks scary. I'm glad we're all going home safely, anyway. Where are Joe senpai and Gomamon? We don't know. Maybe something stopped him from coming? Yeah, maybe. He's in his final year after all. His final year, huh. What is it, Koshiro-kun? No, it's nothing. What? Have I gotten so cute that your heart is racing? No, that's not it. I was kidding. You came back to watch Taichi-san's soccer game, right? Oh, I remember! Give me the airfare. I'm just kidding. I'll be back for a while because of my dad's work. So take good care of me. "Unidentified creatures seen at Haneda Airport" Gomamon! I'm here! Yesterday's unidentified creatures... ...caused major damage in Odaiba and at Haneda Airport. Although miraculously there were no reports of anyone being seriously injured, all Haneda Airport flights were suspended and transportation was seriously affected. Action needs to be taken as quickly as possible. This same creature has appeared a few times in the past. Each time it's caused serious damage. Yesterday's outburst of several monsters all at once created even more damage, and served as a reminder of their menace and destructive power. Here's some public reactions. I'm really worried that they'll come back. They're treating our friends just like the enemy. Even though we fought against Kuwagamon. The children were terrified. I hope they never come back. The government has called an emergency cabinet meeting, while the police and Self-Defense Forces are working together on a response. Oh my, there's nothing scary about you little guys, right? Right! They just don't understand, right? Right! Now the weather. The rainy season will soon end. Yamato. Did you see the news? Tanaka-kun's dad was at Haneda. Seriously? He got injured and was hospitalized. Let's go, Taichi. Mr. Nishijima is not here today. We have so many questions for him. Excuse us. Mimi-san? How come you're here? What? Didn't I tell you? I'm enrolling in 1st year as of today. Same class as you, Koshiro-kun. Your friend? No, she recently transferred here, too. In 2nd year. Maybe she'll be in your class, Sora-san. Really? Can you escort me to class, Koshiro-kun? Yes, sure. Of course. See you, Mimi-chan. Later. Oh yeah, I heard both the concert and game were postponed. I'm sorry. Until things settle down. Maybe. "MEIKO" M... my name is Meiko Mochizuki. I transferred here from Tottori. N... nice to meet you. Let's begin the class. So anyway, what exactly were those unidentified creatures? I dunno. Two monsters showed up and had a wild fight. It's for real irritating. I hope they all just hurry up and die. Don't. But Taichi... No, it's nothing. There's no point in us getting upset. What? What's going on? No... It's nothing. This morning's news? Obviously. Let's all meet up after school. Here he is. Hey, Joe senpai. Sorry I'm late. It's been ages! A souvenir for you. I'm so happy to see you. You haven't changed, Mimi-kun. Sorry to drag you away from studying. That's okay. I also have something to say. First, let's sort out the current situation. I made a summary of six recent, strange events. First... The gate to the Digital World has been closed off for at least a year. For some reason, Digivice was malfunctioning. That's the second event. Third... Regional radio disturbance occurred mainly around Odaiba. Right after, we had that mystery blackout. The 4th was... Radio disturbance brought down the networks, except for wired ones. There was poor reception for cell phones, radiophones and TV broadcasts. Yes. The 5th event. For unknown reasons, space has been distorted... ...which created a new, non-gate connection to Digital World. That's how the Digimons got to this world. Like yesterday's Kuwagamon. The 6th event. The Digimons emerging through these distortions in space are all new to us. They went through some unknown mutation. I suspect all events were caused by the distortions in the curvature of space. Distortions in space... Initially, I didn't know why the first two happened. But now I'm sure it was the same cause. It's clear that the radio disturbance was due to the distortions in space. Most likely caused when Digital World connected to our world. When Digital World... Did you talk to Mr. Nishijima? No, he didn't come to school. Did you see the news? Isn't it terrible? Poor Patamon and the others. I'll ask my dad to make a complaint against the media. They're whipping up attention by using scare tactics. But some of the reporting is true. The airport and Odaiba were totally destroyed by Kuwagamon. I saw the site, so I cannot... It would've been worse if Agumon hadn't tried to stop them. She's right. It's wrong to blame our Digimon friends. I can't accept that. What? Taichi, what do you want to say? No need to hesitate. As Koshiro said, something very bad is already happening. There's something that only we can do. - But... - But what? Have you forgotten, Taichi? All we experienced in the Digital World, the battles we fought to save the world. I'd never forget that! Then why? Come on Taichi! Calm down, Yamato. Taichi. If you are so vulnerable, then... I've had enough. There's no point in having this meeting. Yamato, wait! Taichi. I may as well go back myself. It's okay, I'll talk to my brother later. Me, too. Shall we all go home, then? I'm so hungry. Will someone grab a bite with me? I have to study. A break would do you good. Not me. I don't even have time for my girlfriend. Girlfriend?! You have a girlfriend, Joe senpai? No way! I don't believe it! Is she human? That's a nasty thing to say. You all think I'm lying. I'm the oldest one here. So I have the first right to be happy. Let's all believe him. We believe you. No you don't! Mimi, I'm here. Palmon? Biyomon and Gatomon are here, too. Look. - Biyomon - Gatomon? "MONJA Tonkichi" You have some unusual friends. Enjoy the meal. Let's eat! This is delicious! I always wanted to eat this when I came back to Japan. Naturally. The taste and melting texture are amazing. That is so true. What were we talking about? Taichi and Yamato's fight. Just leave them be. But... Can't do it? They've both grown to be very handsome. What're you gonna do, Sora-san? What does "handsome" mean? I don't get it. Alright then, what type do you prefer? The thing is... You prefer head-some? I like the foot-some. Isn't that Mochizuki-san? Another helping, please. Me too, please. Alright, just a minute. Excuse me. How come you're here? That's my line. I came to see again if Mr. Nishijima is here. Hi. What a long job description! Incorporated Administrative Agency, National Data Processing Bureau... Information Strategy Section, Information Management Office... Grade 2 Management Officer, Daigo Nishijima. So you're not a teacher? Being an agent is my main job. Recently, the distortions have emerged between the Digital World and our world. Digital monsters are using those distortions to come through. So far we've handled them, but more powerful ones are turning up. That's why we asked for your help. We call them "Infected Digimons." Infected Digimons? Some powerful force has infected them. They lose control and start running wild. So we call them Infected Digimons... What force? Sorry, we still don't know that. Is there a way to turn them back to what they were? Perhaps, but we haven't found a way to do it yet. There's so much we don't know. Anyway for now, in order to prevent any further damage to our world. All we can do is drive them back as soon as possible. How do you know so much about them? You even know our secret. After the Hikarigaoka and Odaiba incidents, more people know about Digimon. A walk-in, named Gennai, gave us information. It allows us to make an organized study of these digital monsters. So you know Mr. Gennai? Only from his information. But he seems to know all about your group. He was very helpful to us in the past. If any more powerful Infected Digimons do turn up, we may need to ask for your help again. We'd appreciate it. Yes, of course. Foreign countries are demanding information about the digital monsters. We still don't have all the facts, sir. Can the walk-in, Gennai, give us any more details? We're unable to contact him. Anyway, gather up whatever data you have at hand. Certainly sir. Yes? I passed "it" on to the children. Good. Koshiro-san, I thought you came out to buy clothes, didn't you? Online shopping proves to be a much stronger ally than going to a store. Online shopping? I'm ashamed to admit it but my mother always bought my clothes. Now that I'm in high school, I figure I want to try choosing my own. That's good. But dealing with the sales clerks was too much for me. No doubt. Doing it online is easier for me. No special reason, okay? For this sudden interest in fashion. Of course. Because of Mimi-san? I've developed dress-up software which accurately mimics my body size. I just enter the size and the colors in here. See. I never imagained I'd see you looking for fashionable clothes. Don't cry, Tentomon. Taichi. What are you doing? Taichi? What's wrong, Yamato? Taichi... I wonder if we'll all change? Yamato... Yamato hasn't changed. I can understand why he's mad at me. Maybe I am wrong. What do you think? I don't know. I'm scared. I've destroyed so much without even knowing it. Not just buildings. People, too. Maybe I'll end up killing someone. Why am I rambling at this stage? Taichi. You brought Agumon along, Taichi? Yep. Gatomon and the others are all waiting at home. Yamato has something on. Joe senpai called to say he can't make it. Is this your famous place? Yes, my much-vaunted office. It really is fantastic. Yes, who is it? It's me. Hello. What a fantastic place! It's Koshiro-san's office. What? Seriously? It's our first time here, too. I'm helping out a firm my American friend started. Awesome! I'm impressed. That's everything we heard from Mr. Nishijima. So they're Infected Digimons. And maybe they'll come back again. How annoying. I'm so glad you guys came to help us, Biyomon. Koshiro, maybe it's time to show them what you've made. Yes, I should. Do me a favor, guys. There you go! - Agumon? - Biyomon? Don't worry. They're there. I created a virtual cyberspace within the server here. It's an evacuation strategy for Digimons in an emergency. Text message from Biyomon. How do I read them? Agumon sent one to you, too. We can communicate with them by text, or the monitor. That's really useful. Can they get out? No problem. That's a relief. Can we call them on cell phones? No, phone processing speeds are too slow. But if I use my laptop to access large monitors connected to the network, they can slip in and out of cyberspace. So can we call them anytime? Yes, they'll either be in my office, or in virtual cyberspace. Look at the time! I have to leave. Oh, I'm relieved you and Taichi-san made up. You didn't come today, so I thought you're still sulking. I'm not sulking. We're all meeting up again on Saturday. Make sure you come this time. Bye. You worked all night, Koshiro-san? You need to sleep. I got about 3 hours sleep. I finally finished making them. Try them on, Taichi-san. Okay. Theoretically, you should be able to see the distortions in space. Hey, Taichi. We'll head back to the cyberspace Koshiro made for us. Your computer's their gateway, isn't it? Any monitor connected to the internet will do it. That one should work. Call us if you need us. Sure. So what do we do now? According to my research... ...the distortions seem to occur where mass data concentrates. With those goggles, we should be able to see the data flow. Colors mark the difference in data format and strength. For example, when I connect to my sewer... Yes, the light gets stronger. The red spots are the concentrations related to the distortions. It's highly possible Infected Digimons could appear from large distorted areas. Oh, I see. Let's check for distortions in this area... ...to see in advance whether there are any dangerous spots here. Huh? What's wrong? Did something happen? Well, you see... I was looking for something but I ended up getting lost. Shall we show you around? But... It's okay, we're also searching for something. So it's alright. Hey! You guys come, too. Anyway, what are you looking for, Mochizuki-san? Well... it's a kind of a cat. Kind of? How's this area, Taichi-san? It looks safe. You think it might be here? No, sorry. I was just hungry. Those beyond the 4th row need to work much harder, or you'll fail. Ah, no good... Thanks for this. I'll keep looking by myself. Will you be okay? Yes, thank you for your help. Listen, Koshiro. What is it? These goggles can't see very far. I wonder if there's a way to check everywhere at once. Maybe from a high place? What's tall around here? That's it. Go on. Yamato? Don't push me. You're too complicated. I'll go join Agumon and the others. Why ride the Ferris wheel? Taichi can explain everything. Hey! What? Are you for real? Look, we've put Taichi-san and Yamato-san together. I hope they can make up. Are they fighting? They're still a bit touchy after that last encounter. Perhaps both of them. I bet they're like caged lions. They sure are. Hey. What? About the other day. I shouldn't have got angry, but you need to pull yourself together, too. Infected Digimons could appear at any time. Still hanging up? It's not like you. Not like you used to be. I can't help it. I'm not what I was. Now I see more and understand less. I'm not sure if what we're doing is right. Or maybe... We're doing wrong. I know only we can do it. But it's not that simple. That's just running away. What are those two talking about? I'd love to eavesdrop. Why are we up here? Right, I forgot. What's that? I saw the distortion over there! Attention all visitors. An abnormal climatic event is centered on Odaiba. To avoid injuries, an evacuation warning has been issued. Please leave the area in a safe, orderly manner. This is an emergency. Evacuate immediately. What's happening? What about the children? I can't get through to them. Mei-chan, come here Mei-chan. What is that? Never seen that before. Got it. That's Alphamon. Alphamon? Sorry, that's all the information I have. We must do something. Koshiro-kun, summon Palmon and the others. Right away. There. The precious one. Where are you, Mei-chan? Mei-chan! Meiko! Mei-chan! I'm so happy now. It's okay. You're safe now. Why? What are you doing, Taichi? This way. Are you okay? Yamato! Gabumon? Leave this to us. Come on, Gabumon. - Birdramon! - Kabuterimon! Taichi! Omegamon! It's your turn, Palmon! Okay! Palmon evolution! Togemon! Let's join them. Needle Spray! Taichi. What should I do? Never... I'll never let you have Mei-chan! I must fight. Taichi! If you won't do anything... If you won't do anything, you're just running away! At this rate, everything will be destroyed after all. Not just the city, the people, too! Only we can save them. Let's go, Agumon. Leave it to me, Taichi. Omegamon! They did it. It got away. Taichi. Yamato-san. Is that who you were looking for? Yes, my friend. Is her name Mei-chan? Her real name is Meicoomon. Meicoomon? Mei's my partner Digimon. So you're the DigiDestined, too? Yes, I guess so. That's wonderful. Sorry I didn't tell you. Our band is growing bigger. Fantastic. Mei-chan, these kind people all helped to save you. How good you are safe. Ta much. Ta much What? It's dialect for thank you. Wishing on the stars throwing my pride to the wind I will see tomorrow no matter how hard today I bet I wish Please tell me why we are here right away That which you can see isn't everything I'm freezing so that I'll wear my jacket Finding it becomes transparent and turns into my desire Have you decided? I appreciate that at least you didn't run away.
