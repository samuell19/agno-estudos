(♫ Radio plays Orff's "Carmina Burana") (Train whooshes) (Whistles) (inaudible) (Shouting) (I Punk music) (Shouting) (I Punk music) (Train clatters) - Hello, Henry. - Good afternoon, Mr Cracknell. - Any messages? - Just a cheque come through, sir. Oh, great. Where is everybody? They're at the Chambers meeting in Mr Featherstone's room. Oh. We have these get-togethers regularly to discuss major policy decisions. Very democratic. Oh, and I've put your application to join us on the agenda. - Featherstone will put it to them. - Oh, much obliged, I'm sure. (Featherstone) Well, all assembled? This will be... Oh, I'm sorry. This will be our first Chambers meeting in the absence of a once familiar figure. He's referring to Rumpole, who's at last retired from the Bar. Oh, yes? This set became known as Rumpole's Chambers, very galling for us. For the benefit of newcomers, I'll explain. Rumpole's no longer with us. He's given up the law. His son has been trying to get him to live in America. It seems he's succeeded. He has a son at the University of Miami. We thought we'd never get rid of him, kept giving him farewell dinners! All the same, Chambers isn't Chambers, not without Rumpole. I quite agree. We've at last got rid of the stink of cheap cigars in the passage. There do seem to be fewer villains loitering about Chambers. Do you know, I recall once, one of Rumpole's clients rolled up the waiting room carpet and took it away in a holdall. I shall no longer have the embarrassment of judges raising the question of Rumpole's hat as a disgrace to the legal profession. However, l-|-l digress. Er, Rumpole's final retirement, much delayed as Uncle Tom reminds us... He kept making his positively last farewell appearance. Like a bloody opera singer. Rumpole's final departure has left a considerable gap in our ranks. You might say the loss of one Rumpole has made room for at least two other members of the Bar. We are fortunate indeed Owen Glendour Owen has joined us from Cardiff, with his useful connections in car insurance. Hear, hear. They call me 'Knock for knock Owen' in the valleys. (Laughs) Er, yes, I-I'd like to take this opportunity to raise the question of the other candidate who might share Rumpole's room with you, (Handout Owen. Now, Cracknell has been with us for the past few months as a squatter. I must say it doesn't do a great deal for the reputation of Chambers having a man turning up at the London Sessions on a motor bicycle. Cracknell? Is that the fellow who looks as if he's just dropped in from Mars? I saw him in the Clerk's room. I assumed he'd come to deliver a telegram. Oh, yes, yes, I know you're all against Ken. Well, erm, young Henry tells me that Cracknell gets a fair amount of work. That is absolutely right. He's doing a long fraud with your wife, then a dirty books case in the north. Do we want dirty books in Chambers? Probably more amusing than the Law Reports, eh? And Cracknell tells me he's keen to do cases connected with Civil Rights. - Exactly. - What's wrong with Civil Rights? Better than Civil wrongs, wouldn't you say? Of course, Ken is a radical lawyer. I know that's the sort you don't want to have the key to the lavatory, like women and blacks. Darling, what's come over you? Oh, blacks! They tried to wish a Hindu on us once. I voted for you, old fella, even though you're Welsh. I've had the chance of seeing Ken in action once or twice at Bow Street, and believe it or not, Ken Cracknell is a very attractive advocate. Hello, Ken. - Oh, aren't squatters invited? - Yes, of course. Help yourself to tea. You won't be a squatter for ever. We've been discussing the position of accommodation in Chambers, now Rumpole's left. Everyone's always talking about Rumpole. I've never met the man. (Rumpole) "Kentish Town mystery. The Honourable Rory Canter, "younger brother of Lord Freith and wealthy Hampshire landowner, "stabbed to death in Tube station." My God, that is a mystery! What's an Honourable doing down the Tube like a common barrister? Good Lord! (Girl squeals) - That's nice, Rumpole. - Mmm. - Rumpole! - What's nice, Hilda? Her Majesty the Queen honours Mrs Whitehouse and Mrs Thatcher's milkman. Oh, to be in England now that Maggie's there. Mmm. "Mr Canter had abandoned his Volvo estate car "and gone down the Underground." The honourable gentleman must have been a Tube spotter. I'd wish you'd stop worrying about things like that, Rumpole, now I've persuaded you to retire. Hilda, you did not persuade me to retire. His Honour, Judge Bullingham, persuaded me to retire. I lost ten cases in a row before the Mad Bull. I'm sick of leaving the Bailey with the screams of outraged relatives in my ears. I couldn't have shovelled more customers into Wandsworth if I'd joined the Old Bill. I think Nick and I rescued you just in time, Rumpole. You were looking distinctly seedy. Huh, not half as seedy as my clients. I used to sneak down the Temple Station every night like Napoleon retreating from Moscow. But, Rumpole, we're here in this marvellous climate. We shall have Christmas in the sunshine. Yes, excellent climate I'm sure, if you happen to be an orange. Nick's inviting university friends over for a barbecue, poolside. He's asked the Professor of Law, so you'll have someone to talk to. Oh, what can I say to him? I'm not a lawyer any more. Why would a man abandon his car and dive down the Tube? Oh, well, never mind. Can't possibly be my business now. 'Farewell the ancient court. 'Farewell the wigged troupe and old judge that made oppression virtue. 'O farewell, pride, pomp and circumstance 'of glorious London Sessions. 'Rumpole's occupation's gone.' (Horns blaring) Take me to Coral Gables, please. - It's a sunshine day. - Come again? It's a sunshine day for you and me. Praise to the Eternal Sun, our sunshine message. - You selling something? - Sunlight! I have no need of double-glazing, patio doors or picture windows. We might open a few windows on your soul at Meet and Talk. What? We shall meet and talk as surely as seeds grow in sunlight. - We shall meet and talk. - Excuse me. I've got to get home, my son's giving a party poolside. Sunlight to the Children of the Sun. Blood to the Children of the Dark. A very happy Christmas to you, too. (Knocking) (Woman) Mr Simpson! Come on, Mr Simpson. You've got to get up sometime. How are they going to do without you down the Inland Revenue? Let me in, dear, if you're feeling poorly. Go away, will you? Please go away. This total stranger comes up to me in the street and hands me a sunburnt daisy and suggests we meet and talk. Meet and talk about what? Well, it may seem crazy to you, Dad, but people here like to rap about garden life and such like. Mmm, I thought of charging him my usual conference fee. You're going to have to learn how to communicate with strangers now you've given up the rat race. - Oh, I'm not sure I like that. - What? The world I used to inhabit. Cloud-capped assize courts. The solemn temple, great globe of the Old Bailey itself. Penge Bungalow Murders and the great Grimsby Fish Fraud. Is that all it was, a rat race? Erica! Excuse me, Dad. - Nick, what is this fluid? - That's claret, Dad. - Californian claret. - Claret, is it? It's not bad. Chateau de Menthe Gulch. Ah, it reminds me of the old days to see you cooking on a camp fire. - Remember the beach at Lowestoft? - I must have been nine. Good God! - Nick. - Thanks. Don't you think Dad will be able to make a space here? I think he'll be able to find himself. Oh, I don't know. I might not like myself once I've found me. Anybody home? (Erica) Hi. Come on in. Dad, this is Professor Nathan Blowfield of the Law Faculty. Honoured to meet you, honoured to welcome a trial lawyer from England. Oh, am I a trial lawyer? I always thought I'd passed the test. This is my mother. - Delighted meeting you. - How do you do. Oh, I'll get you some drinks. Mum, Dad, this is Tiffany. Tiffany Jones and Paul. Paul Hayes, from the Department of English and European literature. - Nick tells us you're retired now. - Oh, yes, I've dropped out. I've bought a couple of sunshine shirts and... Hilda and I spend our days bumming round the beach. (Laughter) You've found time to breathe a little? Oh, strangely enough I used to breathe down the Old Bailey. Drinks, everyone. - Miss Jones, is it? - Oh, please, Tiffany. Ah. What department are you in? Statistics. I cover the economic side of Nick's Department of Sociology. Ah, yeah. (US accent) How many one parent families in non-supportive situations, in inter-city areas take to pinching milk bottles? It's a lot of crap, isn't it? Wherever we come from, we can always choose between God and the Devil. Can we? Fate dealt me an old devil called Judge Bullingham for ten cases running. Anyone can choose between them, as sure as seed grows in sunshine. We must meet and talk on this subject, meet and talk. You Americans are so hospitable, Erica. Well, erm, you and Dad are welcome here for as long as you like. For ever. (Hilda) Do you hear that, Rumpole? - She Who Must Be Obeyed. - Are you listening, Rumpole? - Er, what's that, Hilda? - Erica says we're welcome for ever. What do you say to that? Have you anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed upon you? - I'll tell you a bit of law. - I wish my students could hear it. Mrs Rumpole, I'm getting your husband to give a seminar in the Law Faculty. That's very thoughtful, Professor Blowfield, but I really do want Rumpole to rest. There was this old Lord Chief Justice... ...an enormously unlovable character. Used to order muffins in his club after passing death sentences. Well, on this occasion he was about to pass sentence in the usual manner, the Clerk said to the murderer, "Have you anything to say "why sentence of death should not be passed upon you?" The murderer said, "Bugger all, me Lord." The Chief turned to the murderer's counsel, a nervous fellow called Bleaks, "Mr Bleaks, did your client say something?" "Er, er, 'Bugger all, my Lord'." "How extraordinary, I could've sworn I saw his lips move." Poor Nick. He was brought up on that story. It was Winnie the Pooh to him. Er, Mr Rumpole, what would you say was the most important case during your career? The most important was undoubtedly the Penge Bungalow Murders. The Penge Bungalow? Well, what did that decide, exactly? It decided that Rumpole could win a murder alone and without a leader. Did it turn on a nice point of law? Oh, no, Professor. It turned on a nice drop of blood. I - I just thought I'd slip round to the cleaners. All right then, Mr Simpson. I know. I've sinned. You're saying you're guilty, aren't you? How long you known this man, Hubert? How long have you known Honourable Rory Canter, the one you cut? - I didn't know him. - Don't lie to us, lad. It's true. I'd never seen him before. Course, I knew he'd come, sometime. - So, you went after him? - No! Oh, what's the use? They'll never let me escape now. This in your handwriting, Hubert? - Pretty strange sort of letter. - Perhaps. To you. It's written in blood, isn't it, Hubert? Look, we've had the forensic on this document. You wrote this in the blood of the gentleman you knifed. His blood? No. It's not his blood! Hubert... Unless, something miraculous... You're lying to us again, lad. That's no use, you know. Of course. Nothing's any use. They've got the power. I can't fight it. He can't fight it. He tells the police he's guilty. The knife's in his dustbin. He's identified by at least three witnesses, and he writes some spooky letter in his victim's blood. The defence is as dead as mutton. - A defence Rumpole would've enjoyed. - Just my bloody luck! This solicitor mate picks up a fabulous legal aid case for me at Hampstead Magistrate's Court. I thought I'm going to do my first murder on my own and score a triumphant victory. Now, no way. In fact, I'm going to be a triumphant loser. - That letter in blood... - The jury's going to love that. You don't only knife a member of the aristocracy, but you use him as an ink-well to write your correspondence. It's a case that's going to do my career at the Bar no good at all. I must say, Ken, you're frightfully ambitious for a radical lawyer. Even radical lawyers are meant to win their cases. Erm, do you fancy a hamburger or something, then we can talk about it. I can't, Ken. Honestly. My husband will have dinner ready. French traditional from the "Observer" supplement. Ring him, tell him you've been kept late in Chambers. - A late con. - No, I can't. - Another time. - Another time. - You promise? - All right. I promise. Er, look, Ken, about that defence of yours, there is somebody who really knows about blood stains. Professor Ackerman. He's giving evidence for the Prosecution. No. Someone as good as Ackerman. I could write to him, if you like. (Grating noise) (Woman) Good morning, Mr Rumpole. - A letter from London, England. - Oh, really? - Have a nice day now. - Yeah. Rumpole? - Something in the post? - No, Hilda. Just a little gossip from Chambers. - You look happier today, Dad. - Do I? Where you going to? Erica's taking me down to the drug store. Oh, what's the matter? Feeling seedy, are you? Don't be ridiculous, Rumpole, to get ice-cream and candy. She Who Must Be Obeyed is beginning to learn American. Now then. (Muttering) Ah! "The Importance Of Blood Stains In Forensic Evidence". "Professor Andrew Ackerman, MRCP, FC Path". Lovely. I wonder if the Professor's ever received a letter written in the victim's blood? There we are. Blood stains on clothing, on floors, on innocent bystanders. No. Oh, come on, Ackerman, me old darling, you must have considered this problem. Vanished? She couldn't have just vanished. She spent yesterday selling her car. How the hell do you disappear without a car? - Nick! - Dad. What are you doing here? I've just taken your name in vain, borrowed a library book. - Morning. - Morning. You're looking incredibly serious. - We have a mystery on our hands. - Mystery? Fate's been rather generous with mysteries lately. Tiffany Jones seems to have disappeared. My girlfriend. Oh, yes, of course, the statistician? Do statisticians ever disappear? She'll be back, I guess. I don't suppose it's anything. Maybe she melted away in the sunshine. Yes, erm, if you'll excuse me, I have a class to get to. - Be seeing you, Counsellor. - Yes, probably. Nick, I've got to talk to you. I can buy you lunch. Not in the canteen though, somebody keeps dropping nuts into the salad. What manner of stimulant is that? It's the Pilot's Paradise Punch. Try it. There's no way of drinking it without getting a nose full of umbrella. - Listen, Dad... - Where's the straw? Dad, if it's about money, look, just forget it. There's absolutely no hurry. I know you'll chip in when you can. It's not about money. Listen, Nick, when I finally gave match point to his Honour Judge Bullingham and hung up my wig, if I'm not mistaken, a great sigh of relief went up in Chambers, but now they've discovered they can't do without me. - They want me back. - Dad, what are you cooking up? I've received a letter from Miss Phyllida Trant. It seems they've got a murder which raises a few nice questions on blood, so the cry has gone up from Equity Court in the Temple, "Bring back Rumpole!" You're thinking of going back. - Dad... - Ah! What on earth is that? It's a frozen fork for your salad. Look, Dad, I wanted... Good Lord! And this? Thousand Island dressing. It takes a thousand islands to make salad cream and tomato sauce? Excuse me, I'll just "chambrer" my fork. I just thought, and Erica thought this, too, I thought now we could really get to know one another. Oh, come on, Nick. You've always known me better than anybody. Besides, you wouldn't like to watch an old man dying of boredom in the sunshine, would you? - What do you want to do? - I want to go home, Nick. You're in our home, Dad. Yes, I know, dear old lad. But it's not mine. Travelling narrows the mind extraordinarily. And what about Mum? I intend to have every consideration for your mother's feelings. (Means) Rumpole? (Whispers) Goodbye, Hilda. Er, Gaelic, please. 'Gaelic Airlines, who offer you all the luxury of the Bakerloo Line... '...plus the element of fear.' (Laughter) Oh, come on! What about that hamburger? - Not tonight. - Why not? Claude's booked the babysitter. We're going to Festival Hall. - Look, Ken, I promise... - What? I promise I'll turn you over in my mind during the Verdi Requiem. - Thank you very much. - We will be together tomorrow. For a hamburger? For our long firm fraud down the Old Bailey. - Who's that? - What? Up there, in my room. - Good Lord! - What? I only wrote him a letter. What have I done? (Cracknell) Can I help you? No thanks, I've got what I want. - Don't think we've met? - We haven't. I'm Ken Cracknell. Ah, new in the Clerk's Room, are you, Ken? I hope Henry hasn't been caught in the coffee money. - Horace Rumpole. - I'm not a clerk. I'm a member of the Bar. I was a squatter. I hope you're not going to squat in here. I was a squatter until they knew that you were retiring for good. Featherstone gave me a place in Chambers, your place, Rumpole. I share this room with Glendour Owen... Guthrie Featherstone, QC, MP, our head of Chambers, gave you my place? With full support of a Chambers meeting. By the way, that's my brief you're covering with cigar ash. R v Simpson, it's a murder. Ah, yes! A case where I gather from Miss Trant, you're out of your depth. I've come over to see if I can help on the question of blood. Thank you. It's my first murder and I intend to cope with it on my own. That's the spirit in which I took on the Penge Bungalow Murders. You've got your line of defence worked out? We'll talk about it in the morning. Two heads are always better than one. Oh, dear, oh dear, oh dear. I would be obliged if you kept private reading matter at home. - I get very sensitive criminals. - That is not my reading matter! Those are exhibits in an Obscene Publications case. Obscenity, murder! You're leading an exciting life, for one so young. I'll talk to our Head of Chambers about you in the morning. See if we can fix you up with a little annexe. I just don't believe it. If he's back so soon, I don't know why he left. He left, because he lost ten cases in a row before Judge Bullingham. He got deeply depressed about it. I only wrote him a letter. It's probably just a visit, he won't be staying long. I gave you full warning. Always bobbing back, making his positively last appearance. Anyway, Mr Featherstone wants to see him, he'll sort it out, I'm sure. And now then, how much longer in your fraud, Mr Cracknell? Another couple of weeks, Henry. I'm afraid it will clash with your Obscenity up north. We have to return the brief, then there's the murder coming up... You'll be getting awfully rich, for a radical lawyer. I can't leave the fraud, Henry, so I may have to give up the dirty books. (Clears throat) Horace! (Laughs) My dear old Horace! How good of you to look us up while you're in England. We've all missed you terribly. As everyone says, Chambers just isn't Chambers without old Horace Rumpole. - Is that what they say? - Hardly a day goes by. 'Our Head of Chambers looks like an heroic Macbeth, 'forcing himself to invite Banquds ghost to take a seat. "'Would he care for a cigarette?"' - Would you care for a cigarette? - No thanks. And you look so well, so remarkably well. I've never seen you looking better. Hilda enjoying it there? I'm sure she is. Oh, She Who Must is perfectly content, thank you. She was never particularly interested in blood. - I'm not quite with you, Horace. - I've had enough compassionate leave. I've come to fight it out down the Old Bailey. Horace, do you think that's wise? You-you-you were looking dreadfully tired, as I remember. "Oh, for my peace will I go far as Wanderers do, that still do roam. "But find my strengths, such as they are here in my bosom and at home." - Horace... - Ben Johnson, if you remember. - Farewell to the world. - Rumpole... This is my home, Featherstone. These chambers have been my home for 40 years. And, as you so aptly put it, "Chambers just isn't Chambers without old Horace Rumpole". Rumpole... I am glad you said that about missing me. Up to now I hadn't noticed the red carpet, cut flowers on the desk, courtesy of the Management. I poked my nose in the Clerk's Room, champagne was flowing like cement. (Laughs) Well, the fact is, er...you see, my dear Horace, your coming back would rather rock the boat of Chambers. I am back. Since your departure we've taken on two new members. We reckoned you were worth at least two barristers so we've put two in your room, Glendour Owen and Ken Cracknell. I've met young Cracknell. He's got himself a nice murder. I might just be able to help him out, well lead him perhaps. - Ken's got your room, Rumpole. - He was hanging about in my room. Quite welcome, as long as he doesn't continue to litter the place with licentious comics. How were we to know that you were ever coming back? It's a fait accompli. We've given Ken a seat, and Glendour Owen, who has a huge practice in motor insurance. (Laughs) 'Knock for knock Owen' they call him on the Welsh circuit. We've promised them both seats. Well, can't you find them seats in some passage? - We've promised them a room. - Well, rent more accommodation. - Think big, Featherstone, expand. - I'm afraid we can't afford it. We've got to cut back, reduce our cash flow. England is in for four years hard. Are you trying to tell me, Featherstone, in your devious and political kind of way, that there is no room for Rumpole at the inn? I'm afraid, Horace, that that is exactly it. I see. Well, I know exactly what I shall do. Go back to Florida? Of course you should. Huh, I'm sure we all envy you the sunshine and-and-and wish you many long and happy years. Back to Florida? No, I don't think so. I'm going to give up being an orange. I shall squat. Hello, hello? Is that Austin, Swink & Pardoner of Grimble? Mr Handyside, please. Did you say Handyside? Not old Albert! Ah, Albert! It's Mr Cracknell's Clerk here... It's about our Obscenity in the north. Mr Cracknell's going to be tied up down the Old Bailey for two weeks. - Miss Trant's in the case with him. - Henry. Mr Glendour Owen? - He's doing a long rape in Swansea. - Henry. I'm sorry I can't oblige you. There just isn't anyone in Chambers. Henry, a moment of your valuable time. Mr Rumpole, I am on the telephone. Yes, to Albert Handyside who was my Clerk when you were in rompers! I'd like a word with him when you've finished. Put him through. - Will you be in Mr Cracknell's room? - I'll be in Mr Rumpole's room! Albert, Mr Rumpole would like a word with you. (Buzzes) Hello? Albert Handyside? (Laughs) Yes, it is. How are you, Albert? How are the tomato plants, flourishing, are they? Oh, yes, December. Yes, I am and I'm delighted. Henry tells me we're doing a case in Grimble, looking forward to that. Oh, he didn't tell you? He told me. Well, I expect it slipped his mind. Yes, I'll put you back on to him, you can make sure I'm available. Oh, yes, quite a lot, I'm snowed under in fact, but I'll find time to squeeze your little Obscenity in. Yes, so am I looking forward to it. All right. Give my love to Lancashire. Bye. Henry, Albert wants a word with you. Quite like old times. - Isn't that Cracknell's brief? - Er, yes, yes. Just erm, just having a friendly look at it. You must be Glendour Owen by the sound of you? Yes. I share this room with Cracknell. Oh, well, always welcome, of course. But, er, I'm afraid things are going to be a bit of a crush until we get things, er, sorted out. But you can find yourself a corner...somewhere. - Rumpole... - Glendour Owen. I was given to... It seems Albert Handyside wants to instruct you in this Obscenity, sir, Mr Cracknell being in a difficulty. Does he really? Good old Albert. I'll try and squeeze it in of course. I don't mind doing returns until things get going again, Henry. - Things, Mr Rumpole? - Yes, my practice, Henry. - Solicitors been asking for me? - No, sir. Not exactly. Seems the word's got around, sir, about you losing all those cases down the Bailey. A protracted run of Judge Bullingham, Glendour Owen. That won't happen again. How long will you be staying? Yes, Rumpole. How long will you be staying? Well, I don't really know. There's nothing the matter with the ticker, thank God. And a good intake of claret keeps me astonishingly regular. I could be here what, oh, ten, fifteen years. Gentlemen in Chambers getting their own work, Mr Rumpole? It's not in the best traditions of the Bar. "Not in the best traditions of the Bar." He sounds like Judge Bullingham. - Rumpole... - Glendour Owen. Let's get one thing clear... You're not the Glendour Owen, the one that does the car insurance? Well, yes, as a matter of fact, I am. I didn't realise. I was a guest at the Sheridan Club last night. The Lord Chancellor was talking about you. The Lord Chancellor? "That 'Knock for knock' Owen, does all the car insurance. "Make a wonderful circuit judge, just the type we need in Wales." - Oh, he couldn't speak too highly. - A judge? I've never even considered the idea. Well, consider it, Owen. Turn it over in your mind when you're on the Tube to Uxbridge County Court. The Lord Chancellor's got his eye on you. "The expense of spirit in a waste of shame is lust in action, "and till action lust is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame, "savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust. "Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight. "Past reason hunted "and no sooner had, past reason hated, "as a swallowed bait on purpose laid to make the taker mad." (HHdE) Rumpole? Yes, Hilda. - Hilda? - Rumpole! Where are you, Rumpole? I know perfectly well you're here. I can smell your cigar. Rumpole! Ah, Hilda. What a lovely surprise. Why weren't you at the airport? Well, I can hardly be expected to hang around Heathrow every night, in the vain hope that you're going to descend from the skies. - I wired you. - You what-ed me? - I sent you a telegram. - A telegram? You certainly didn't! Oh, well I must have thought it was from the Inland Revenue. This place looks like a rubbish tip, Rumpole. I don't suppose you've done any washing up. And why has the 'To Let' sign been taken down? - Because I'm living here. - Why are you living here? - Because it's my home, Hilda. - Our home was in America. We were perfectly happy there. You were perfectly happy there, Hilda. Sneaking away like that, leaving me that ridiculous note, telling me to stay behind and be happy. I hated you, Rumpole. What is at the bottom of all this, hmm? Hmm? What is at the bottom of your extraordinary behaviour, hmm? I shall find out. You can't hide anything from me, Rumpole. I knew it was too good to last. "School Girl Capers - Number Four". Where the devil is...? - Rumpole? - Ah, Featherstone! You play golf with old Keith from the Lord Chancellor's office! Couldn't you do something with that Celt that hangs round my room? (Handout Owen'? Breaking his heart to be a Circuit judge. Couldn't you do something? There must be vast, lawless stretches of Wales where he could be useful. Rumpole... Can't you see I'm about to have a conference? I hope this is a one-off, Rumpole. Where the hell is "Schoolgirl Capers - Number Four"? Henry tells me you've helped yourself to this Obscenity. I trust you won't make a habit of it, we haven't got the accommodation. I've beet making a habit of it for over 40 years, Featherstone. (Buzzing) Hello, Henry? Oh, old Albert's here and the client? Shoot 'em in, will you? - I'll talk to you later, Rumpole. - Yeah. I happen to be sitting on the Committee on Pornography. I wonder if I could have a glance at those, er, magazines later? Purely as a matter of public duty, of course. Oh, dear. This Alderman Pertwee, Chairman of the Watch Committee, Member of the Festival of Light, President of Clean-up-Grimble Society comes into my Sowerby Street shop while I'm out at a Rotary lunch. Mr Meacher owns Adult Reading Mart with 20 branches in the north of England. 'Eldorado, a promise of briefs untold.' And my damn fool of an assistant, Dobbs, only sells him 150 quid's worth of adult reading matter, films and visual aids. Of course, Pertwee's round to the constable with them in five minutes. Mr Rumpole'll have your defence worked out, Mr Meacher. I'd like to go for this Pertwee. The man's a hypocrite. There's been nasty rumours about the Alderman. Mr Meacher, this adult reading matter of yours, is it put forward as something likely to drive a young man's fancy wild with unsatisfied desire? To conjure up for the lonely and unfulfilled citizens of Grimble the abandoned delights of the bed chamber? Well, to be quite honest with you, yes. Let's be really honest, Mr Meacher, no. There is only one word for this rubbish, off-putting. The Prosecution could have done you under the Trade Descriptions Act. I'm not with you, Mr Rumpole. Mr Meacher, what are the least aphrodisiac conceptions, the things most deadening to lust? Income Tax? Flannel vests? Fish fingers? Woollen socks worn with sandals? Party Political broadcasts? No, no, in my opinion they all come a very bad second to "Schoolgirl Capers" and "Double Bondage in the Tower of Terror". Oh, and you can throw in "Manacle Me Darling" as an additional extra. - Mr Rumpole! - "Schoolgirl Capers"? There isn't a schoolgirl in there under 40. However, attractive as it would be to point out that this material is merely a boring waste of money, I shall not take that line. I'm very glad to hear it. This is a serious case. Very serious, Mr Meacher, far more serious than that tripe taken away by Alderman Pertwee. That is stock valued at 150 pounds. Stock valued above gold, Mr Meacher! Our priceless heritage. The birthright of the Briton, freedom of speech, Mr Meacher. That is how we are going to win this one. - You mind? I'm having a conference. - This is my room! Some other time. I must talk to you about that murder of yours, I've had a few ideas, bye. "Words," we shall say to the jury, "words must be free." For freedom is indivisible. Man has the freedom to read the boldest speculations, the most dazzling philosophy, to question God, to explore the universe, to follow poetry into the most exquisite sensuality or the finest religious ecstasy. So, must he have the freedom to blunt his brains on "Schoolgirl Capers"? I utterly deplore that rubbish you are selling, Mr Meacher, but I will defend to the death anyone's right to read it. I like it. I mean, I really like it. As a defence, if I might say, it has a certain amount of class. (Chuckles) Oh dear, oh dear. What are you reading now, Rumpole? The obituaries. Oh, that makes a change, I suppose. Change? I always read the obituaries in "The Times". "His Lordship, Freddie Foxgrove, is dead." Judge Jeffries without the laughs. Is that really lively enough reading for you, Rumpole? The obituaries can never be lively reading. Are you feeling all right, Hilda? I'm not sure, Rumpole. Are you? What? Feeling quite all right, because if you're not for any reason, I asked Dr MacClintock to call in this evening for a glass of sherry. I've never felt better in my life. Yes, well, he's only dropping in for a friendly call. You could discuss with him any little difficulties you may be having about anything. I've got to get an early train to Grimble tomorrow. Grimble. Isn't that where you did the case with that actress? Ah, yes. What are you going to Grimble for this time? Sex. Well, some would say sex. Some would say...freedom. Oh, my God! Splendid sherry, Rumpole. Amontillado? Pommeroy's Pale Plonk. Doctor, I hope you don't mind me asking you, but why have you dropped in like this? I mean, apart from mopping up the Spanish-style rot gut. Rumpole, Hilda came to see me. Oh, she's feeling seedy, is she? Ah, she should have stayed planted in the sun. I told her she should never have come over to England this time. She was concerned about you, Rumpole. Do you really like that stuff? I stick to claret myself. As I explained to Hilda, it's nothing to be ashamed of. I don't feel ashamed about drinking... Everyone has their little kinks, their little peculiarities. You know, sometimes a doctor wonders if there's any such thing as a normal man. Do you? Now, I have been married to Marcia, as you know, for going on 30 years. Yes, how is the good lady? And I can't say that I've never been tempted to throw the whole thing up. I-I won't say for a gym slip and a pair of pigtails but... What you? You, too? Sometimes I think the whole world's going mad. But we've got to try and see this in proportion, Rumpole. Now, it's nothing to be guilty about. Good. Hilda was telling me you're up north tomorrow. - Ah, that's right, yes. - Ah, the best thing. A bit of a winter break. Ah, Marcia and I went to Malta last year. You're not going with anyone, are you, Rumpole? - No, of course not! - Well, that's what I said to her. I said I didn't think anyone would be interested in going to the north of England, er, with you, Rumpole. Oh, thank you very much. No, no, no. I hope this has made you feel better. As a matter of fact, I feel considerably worse now. You're not to worry, Rumpole. You see, we all have our little guilty secrets. We all have, problems. 'I dare say. But why does this quack have to work his out on my sherry?' What's the use? I can't fight against them, not the miracle workers. Mr Simpson, you've certainly got a difficult case. But Mr Cracknell's a barrister who's had a good deal of success. I've briefed him in a lot of cases. They can change the blood. They can change the blood on a piece of paper. How can I fight against that? He's got a whole lot of acquittals to his credit. I have sinned. L-|-l appreciate... What can I do? Mr Simpson, who had the knife? He gave me the knife. They wanted me to kill myself. That's the cunning of them, you see. So you had the knife, Mr Simpson? Now, why did you use it? I'm so tired. Was it sex, Mr Simpson? Had he come down there to make sexual advances? Were you trying to fight him off? That's the defence that appeals to me. He was that sort of bloke, Eton and the Guards. That sort of character, your class 'A' gay. Please, I can't say any more. Come on, Ken, you'll pull off something. You've always done up till now. You don't want a silk, do you? Not a silk, no. But perhaps a very experienced member of the Junior Bar. You know, Mike, if you've got to insult an aristocratic corpse, grey hair might be a help. An experienced junior? Who? You got any ideas? Alderman Pertwee, did you visit the Adult Book Mart in Sowerby Street on the afternoon of January 10th last? I did, Your Honour, and I found books and magazines of the most flagrant immorality on open display. Your Honour, I must object. Yes, Mr Rumpole? If the Alderman could restrain himself from treating us like a Sunday night gathering in the Baptist Chapel. Confine yourself to the evidence, if you would, Alderman Pertwee. It will be for members of the jury to decide on the exact nature of the articles for sale in the bookshop. And, Alderman, did you purchase at that shop the following articles, "Schoolgirl Capers", volume one, numbers one to six, "Double Bondage in the Tower of Terror", "Manacle Me Darling", and the five films the jury have already seen? I did, Your Honour. Now, just a few questions, Alderman Lancelot Pertwee. You say that this shop, The Adult and Continental Book Mart, is a source of corruption? I regard it as a terrible source of corruption. Oh, standing, as it does, between a betting shop and the off-licence of the Grimble Arms? Who is more corruptible, Alderman, the punters or the boozers? I object. How can this witness possibly answer such...? Oh, can you not? I thought you were here as an expert on corruption. Does not the Grimble Arms have Topless A-Go-Go on the bar as an attraction on Friday? I believe that it does. It's regrettable. Well, don't you think it's preferable to have sex neatly packaged in books and magazines, rather than knocking over pints of Newcastle Brown? " (Laughter) " (Judge) Silence! I don't know. I've never been to the Grimble Arms on a Friday night, nor to any other bar, either. I am a total abstainer. Not from the bookshops, however. Tell me, there are no convent schools or kindergartens in Sowerby Street, are there? - No, there are not, but... - Abide me no buts, Alderman. Does not the Adult Book Mart have written over the door in large letters, "Entry to Minors Prohibited"? I can think of no sign, Mr Rumpole, more immediately attractive to modern youth. Be that as it may, there were no kiddiewinks present when you were in the shop? Not when I was there, no. In fact, the clientele consisted of three middle-aged gentlemen during their middle-class lunch hour. Oh, I know, perhaps they were all Aldermen of the fair city of Grimble. They were all middle-aged men. - Of perfectly respectable appearance? - I suppose so. No one was actually slavering at the mouth or walking around with their knuckles brushing the linoleum? I really don't understand what my learned friend is getting at. The Prosecution says that this rubbish depraves and corrupts. Er, it's not rubbish, Mr Rumpole. The Defendant will remain silent. It's adult reading matter of an exotic nature. This 'unmitigated rubbish' which you encouraged, Alderman, by spending £150 on assorted magazines and films. - Was that ratepayers' money? - I took a float, yes. Er, when I made this investigation on behalf of my committee. Oh, and do the ratepayers of Grimble know you are spending their hard-earned pennies on "Schoolgirl Capers"? Mr Rumpole, no doubt you have more questions to ask Alderman Pertwee? - A few, Your Honour. Only a few. - Then, we might have them tomorrow. Meanwhile, members of the jury will read these books and er, magazines. There's absolutely no need to bore the jury, Your Honour. The Defence will rely on general principles, our ancient freedoms, above all, the freedom of speech. Your Honour, I would like the jury to read every single word. There you are, members of the jury, the Prosecution's always far more interested in sex than we are. (Telephone rings) Hello. Rumpole, what are you doing? What are you up to? Hey... What? Nothing special happened last night, Hilda, we were reading the porn. PornograPhY- Well, I don't know how long. Another night at least. Hilda. Hilda! (Man) Oh, very clear. Thank you very much indeed. And a very good day to you, too, Mrs Pertwee. - What did you call her? - Albert called her Mrs Pertwee. That's who she is, wife of the Alderman! She came about her divorce, but wants you to use her statement to cross-examine her husband. Go on, you read that. It'll straighten your hair, it will. I'm used to a respectable business. He's been keeping this young girl up Pond End, been going on for years. And she had to leave as she failed to agree to a certain practice. It's all in there, read it! No, Mr Meacher. I told you, we are going to win this case on liberty, on the freedom for everyone, including Alderman Pertwee, to please themselves, to do as they like, providing they don't do it in the street and frighten the horses. "It is not to be thought of "that the flood of British freedom, "which to the open sea of the world's praise from dark antiquity "hath flowed with pomp of waters unwithstood, should perish." (Clears throat) Members of the jury, freedom is indivisible. You cannot pick and choose with freedom. And if we allow freedom for the opinions we cherish and hold dear, so must we allow the same freedom to opinions we detest, and even to works of such unmitigated rubbish as "Schoolgirl Capers" volume one, numbers one to six. Let those who wish to read them, do so. They will soon weary of the charms of elderly schoolgirls. You and I, members of the jury, stand, do we not, for tolerance? We are not intolerant of Alderman Pertwee. He has the freedom to express his opinions. We do not seek to call him a hypocrite or have him banned. Ours is the tolerant approach. And if we are tolerant in great matters, so must we be in the little trivial matter of these puerile magazines. For once we start in the business of censorship, and the banning of books, at that moment we say... farewell to freedom. Eighteen bloody months! Yes, well, try and look on the cheerful side, Mr Meacher. You'll be in an open prison, hobnobbing with bent coppers, twisted solicitors, all the toffs. I wouldn't be in prison if you'd done your job! - You didn't like the speech? - I told you to go for that bastard! - "Go for the jugular," I said. - It was Mr Rumpole's decision. Crucifying the Alderman would not have got you off. Look, how can he be on the Council, hey? Oh. A lay preacher chairman of the watch committee and that judge gives me 18 months for defacing the fair city of Grimble? That was a bit steep, yes. The Station Hotel may have a certain macabre Gothic charm, but Grimble's hardly Venice in the spring time, I grant you. Well, I'm going to appeal. That, in my opinion, would be quite hopeless. I don't give a damn about your opinion, all right? Albert, I want you to get me a young brief, somebody with guts who'll tell the truth about Lancelot bloody Pertwee. You're just like the old punters I get in my shops, Mr Rumpole, blokes what's past it. (I Radio plays romantic music) (Door slams) Rumpole, is that you, darling? What did you call me, Hilda? I called you "darling". Can't I call you "darling", Rumpole? Oh, I suppose there's no reason why not. There's a rather odd smell in here, isn't there? Oh, is there? Yes, a distinctly strange sort of smell. Like a mixture of RC churches and old flower vases. Oh, dear, that's not very romantic, is it, Rumpole? It's, er, lavender water. It's the lavender water that you give me every Christmas. I'm sorry, I didn't recognise it. Since we met, you've given me 40 bottles of lavender water. Well, I don't know what else you like the smell of. Case at Grimble was an unmitigated disaster. Very unsatisfied client. I say, Hilda, have you got a cold or something, been in bed, have you? - What do you mean? - You've got your dressing gown on. Well, it's really more of a negligee. Oh, yes, of course. I made the mistake of appealing to their ancient British sense of freedom. Freedom's gone out of fashion in Grimble. Oh, God! That singer appeared to be in some pain. Oh! That was "These We Have Loved". Oh, we're not too old, are we, Rumpole, to enjoy something sentimental? No,no,no. You don't need to read those magazines. After all, you are married. - What magazines? - A dreadful thing about schoolgirls. I found it in the magazine rack. Number four! Well, of course I had to read it, it was evidence in the case. In the what? The Obscenity case I have just lost at Grimble. Good God, you don't think I enjoyed reading that rubbish? - I was never so bored in my life. - Bored? Is that what you were? - Well, naturally. - What, you didn't read it, did you? Oh, no, of course not. It was your work, was it? - That's all it was? - Absolutely all! Well, I've got to get on. No good hanging around in the sitting room all night, chattering away to you. I've got a meal to prepare. It'll be something cold, I'm afraid. ' PIN“? ' Hmm'? Do you think...? Did Rumpole leave the Bar because he was losing all his cases? Only in front of Bullingham. It was a run of bad luck, it was bound to end some time. But he lost his nerve? Possibly, yes. I think losing your dirty books case in Grimble's shaken him a bit. I wonder what would happen if he lost a really big one? Hmm... Oh, morning. Ah, Ken. Do you mind if I call you Cracknell? I'm afraid I didn't do too well at Grimble. Henry told me. Very dissatisfied client. He got 18 months. Oh, well, it wasn't your fault. It seems Rumpole spouted Wordsworth at the jury. It went down like a lead balloon. Yeah. I must admit, I found the result a little disappointing. There'll be other cases. Meacher's got 20 of those dirty book shops. They're all coming up for trial, I doubt if I'll get a brief in any. As a matter of fact, I was thinking of asking you to lead me in a murder. - What, me? - R v Simpson. I think you're absolutely right for this. My dear fellow, I won't argue with you. I don't want some smooth silk who'll make him plead guilty. - Never plead guilty! - I don't know what the answer is. It's not an easy case. Worry not, old darling, your days of anxiety are over. My dear Cracknell, may I call you Ken? The answer to this, as in so many cases... ...lies in the blood. - It's a miracle. - I wouldn't say that, Mr Simpson. It may seem miraculous to you. A gift from heaven, is that how it strikes you? What? My being here. Oh, nothing more miraculous than the Gaelic Airlines cut-price budget special, which is a little like being shot across the Atlantic in a rather unclean corner of the Tea Bar at Kings Cross Station. About the blood. It must be a miracle. Mr Simpson, if you have one tiny fault, could it be that you are a trifle ready to assume the miraculous? I can't fight it. Oh, you can fight it, Mr Simpson, and you will fight it. You're going to ask me about what happened in the station. Am n They can work miracles, you see. - They always told me they could. - They, who are "they"? I can't tell you that. Oh, never mind. Never mind. I'm sure you will be able to. No, I was going to ask you a few questions about yourself. Now, you work, do you not, in the office of the Inspector of Taxes, Clapham Division? Yeah. Not a criminal offence, although it'll hardly endear you to the jury. I've always been good at figures, since I was quite a kid. Figures hold no mystery for me. Oh, you like your work, do you? Oh, yeah, I do, very much. Oh. Every Thursday after work, I go to evening classes in Advanced Accountancy. Did you travel regularly to your evening classes by Tube? - I don't run to a car, Mr Rumpole. - Yeah. What about supper, when you went to your evening classes? I'd always buy a take-away chicken, and then take the Tube on to my bedsit. Who'll talk about your character, friends at work? I haven't got any... I don't know many people. They call me The Duchess in the Inland Revenue. They what? It's a bit of a joke on my name, I suppose. Mrs Simpson...the Duchess. Yes. - I suppose it's a funny joke. - Yes, richly entertaining. You've always been in the tax gathering business? Since I left school. I came in as a tea boy in the Pay-As-You-Earn. Now, I'm number two accountant in the Schedule D. A meteoric rise. Now, what about your spare time, holidays, that sort of thing? - Spare time? - Mm-hmm. Well, it's television, and I bring work home. Oh, do you? Well, speaking as a tax payer, Mr Simpson, Duchess, couldn't you be a little less dedicated to your calling? What about holidays? Hmm? Holidays... I used to stay with my mother in Worthing, until she was gathered. Oh, I'm sorry. Only this year, I managed a holiday abroad. I went to the sunshine, on a package. Sunshine? Not the Sunshine State, Duchess? - You didn't go "there", did you? - Yeah. Florida. You took your annual leave in Florida? When did it happen, Mr Simpson? When and where in Florida did it happen? All right. All right. You can tell me later on. Later on we'll meet and talk, friend and brother, as sure as the seed grows in the sunlight. We shall meet and talk. They sent you! - They sent you! - Of course they didn't! I do wish you'd get your mind off miracles. I told you, I came over on the Gaelic Airlines budget special, held together with chewing gum and Welsh harp strings. The only miracle, Mr Simpson, is that I got here at all. - Is he insane? - Oh, really, Ken. Who's sane? You, I, the learned Judge? Or those screws in there who sentence themselves to life imprisonment? - All right, is he fit to plead? - Of course he is. And he's fit to be acquitted. I see by your brilliant cross-examination in the Magistrates Court, you're suggesting that Simpson did it, protecting his honour against a homosexual attack. It seemed about the only line. The Guardsman's defence? Isn't that rather old-fashioned for a bright, young, radical barrister? You don't think it'll work then? I don't think the Guardsman defence works particularly well, if you have a client nicknamed "The Duchess". - Do you want a lift? - Er, thank you, no. I had enough excitement on Gaelic Airlines. (Engine revs) You might make a few tactful enquiries about the Honourable Rory Canter, deceased. - About his sexual habits? - Oh, dear boy, no. About his religion. Rumpole's ringing his son in America. I'd say he's thinking of vanishing back into the sunset, as likely as not. Handing out flowers? Well, yes, yes, of course I'll try... Listen, it's all... It's all in your letter, is it? Well, anyway, you sound happy. Yes. Yeah. Bye, Dad. Oh, love to Mum. He doesn't want to come back, does he? No. No, he wants me to find Tiffany Jones. And she left no message, nothing? Not a thing, but at least she's alive. - How do you know? - Someone came for her things. - Someone? Who? - I don't know, I wasn't there. Sort of crazy, the things they took. No clothes, no make-up, none of the things you'd expect. What things? Her maths books and calculators, things she works with. Meet and talk? Yes. Why, yes, I'd like to. Sure thing, you and I have all the time in the world for each other. You haven't done much talking lately? Just exchanged words, not real talking? Exchanged words. - Yes, that's exactly it. - That's all you do on the outside. But, never talk, one heart to another's heart, beating as one. They never know that, the Children of the Dark. It's just I've been feeling lonely... Come with me, friend and brother. The lonely days are over. Call me William. A family name's the first thing we give up as Children of the Sun. - Children of the Sun? - We shall inherit the Earth. The Master gives us everything. He protects us with his power. - His power for the miraculous. - Miracles? Oh, sure. He's not bound by the laws of Man or Nature. Well, I must say I'm interested. I'd like to visit you. To visit with us, is to stay with us. Well, I don't know what I've got to lose. Only the chains of Darkness, Nicholas. Where's you car? Well, let me tell you, if you decide to stay with us, there is a contract. Do I have to sign something? You just write the words of power, but in rather a special way. - What sort of way is that, William? - In your life blood, Nicholas. Everyone does it. The Master, Nicholas. A new friend and brother. - The name's Nicholas. - Be very welcome, Nicholas. Be very welcome, Nicholas. I'll go find the Parents in Love to greet you. Tiffany... Tiffany! - Nick, have you come inside? - What are you doing? - Paul's gone crazy looking for you. - I'm working for the Master. We're not supposed to talk to outside people. What the hell at? On books, using my skill in figures. - Tiffany, now tell me... - I can't tell you anything. The last guy they had for accounting, he was a traitor. He betrayed them, that's why they needed me. - Who was he, Tiffany? - Some guy from England. Nick, I can't stop. Hey, you, friend, you own that \/\N? Yes. Tiffany... - Be welcome, Nick. Be very welcome. - Tiffany, let me take you hone. Don't be ridiculous, Nick. I am home. Drive it round to the car port with the other gifts. (Shouting) "'Nor for my peace shall I go far as travellers do, that still do roam "'But make my strengths, such as they are "'Here in my bosom and at home."' 'Huh, it's quite ridiculous, of course. 'Home is Ludgate Circus, usually in the rain. 'Home is breakfast in Rex's caff. 'And the friends and relations of various villains, 'reading the lists of forthcoming attractions. 'Home is climbing into the full fancy dress 'in the robing room. 'Home, God save us all, 'is his Honour Judge Bullingham. 'Oh, excuse me, His Lordship, 'now promoted to a senior Old Bailey Judge, 'entitled to try murder cases.' Mr Rumpole, do you appear for the Defence? Er, yes, Your Honour... My Lord. I have the honour of representing Mr Simpson. And may I take this opportunity of saying what a great pleasure it is to be appearing before Your Lordship once again. (M utters) 'l have the distinct feeling 'that the Mad Bull is even less delighted to see me 'than I am to have drawn him for the eleventh time.' Very well, let's get on with it. Mr Colefax. May it please Your Lordship. Members of the jury, in this case I appear to prosecute, with my learned friend Mr Magnus Piecan. 'Moreton Colefax, QC. I knew him when he was doing dangerous drivings 'round the Thames Magistrates Court. 'The poor fellow's totally ignorant on the subject of blood.' Members of the jury, this case concerns the knifing of a perfectly respectable citizen, a member of a well-known family in Kentish Town Underground Station. It is a somewhat squalid story... 'Oh, Colefax, my poor old darling, 'you shouldn't touch it with a pair of silver tongs. ...squalid motives have been suggested for this killing... 'The Guardsman's defence, 'put forward by young Ken Cracknell here. 'It never had a hope.' ...but you will hear the deceased, known as Rory Canter was sexually perfectly normal, a young man of strong religious convictions... 'Did you say religious? 'There, now, Colefax, you may be onto something.' - Benjamin Dole! - Here. You say you saw the deceased come on to the platform first? Yes, Mr Rumpole, he said that. And then you saw my client, Mr Simpson, come down afterwards? Following him, Mr Rumpole. No, My Lord, he did not say 'following him'. He said, and I have my learned friend Mr Cracknell's note, he said, "He came down afterwards." Well, if you think it makes the slightest difference. The difference will become apparent by the end of this case. - Even to Your Lordship. - Mr Rum...! For all you know, the Honourable Rory Canter came down the Tube to look for Mr Simpson? For all I know, yes, sir. If a person ever goes out looking for the man who's likely to attack him, Mr Rumpole. Oh, My Lord, I should say that that frequently happens. 'I came halfway round the world to find you.' Very well. Just get on with it. So, you saw Mr Canter waiting on the platform? He was sitting there, yes, sir. He made no attempt to get on the train? He didn't get on it. - Though the train was waiting? - Yes, sir. He sat there, waiting to accost my client... By 'accost' I suppose you mean 'sex', Mr Rumpole? 'Oh, the poor old Bull has a resolutely filthy mind.' Oh, Your Lordship, we mustn't jump to conclusions, however sensational. I thought we were going to be treated to the Guardsman's defence. Oh, Your Lordship has the better of me. - Is that a legal or military expression? - You ought to know, Mr Rumpole. You've used it in a number of cases when you were practising regularly. 'Regularly? What d'you think I'm doing now, playing Tiddlywinks? Mr Dole, you did see Mr Canter speak to my client? I see that, yes, sir. - Then the beginnings of a struggle? - Yes, sir. - Then your train left the station? - Yes, sir. Tell me, Mr Dole, how long it'd be before the next train would arrive? - I think about five minutes, sir. - Five minutes. Thank you. Now, my last question. Good. You never saw my client produce any sort of knife? No, sir. He never saw any knives at all, because his train had left. Yes, Mr Colefax, who's your next witness? (Usher) Diana Revere! - Are you Miss Diana Revere? - Call me Smokey. Were you going down into Kentish Town Station on the night in question? Yeah, with me mates, we was going to Public Execution in Watford. Do they still have those in Watford? - No. It's a band, innit? - (Laughter) 'Good Lord, the Bull's made a funny.' Did you notice anything on the platform? - I saw two blokes, yeah. - What were the two men doing? Well, one was on the seat, and the other... Him what had the bag from the... My Lord, there is no dispute that that was my client, Simpson. I can imagine there's no dispute about that. I'm obliged. What happened then? We all got on the train, and I saw the one with the carrier bag get on. He come in our carriage. Now, Miss Revere, let me ask you this. Did you notice the man on the platform seat when your train was pulling out? Yeah, I saw 'im, I saw 'im topple over. - Topple over? - Well, sort of slid sideways. - He went all limp and boneless. - Why do you think that was? I thought maybe he was pissed or on the needle. You get a lot of them down the Tubes. Did you notice Mr Simpson in your carriage? Yeah, he was looking in his plastic bag. Then, he leant back and closed his eyes. - Looked like he wanted to sleep. - Thank you, Miss Revere. You saw my client close his eyes. As though he were tired? Looked like it, yeah. Members of the jury, you may know that that is a very common reaction to be exhausted after you've made a violent attack. And you may also know that people are frequently exhausted and in a state of shock after having been attacked. Miss Revere, at no time did you see my client writing on any sort of scrap of paper? - No. I didn't. - Thank you, Miss Revere. - Rumpole must be in his element. - I'm not so sure. He looked a bit grey around the edges by the end of the day. You're very sweet, Ken, to have wangled this brief for him. - It's just what he needs. - I hope so. I hope it does the trick. Ken, Claude and the baby are going to stay with his parents next week. I can't get away, it's this endless robbery I'm doing. We might have that hamburger you're always on about. - Well, Rumpole, how was court? - Terrible. The client won't talk to me and the Mad Bull's madder than ever. I wonder what I'd get for doing grievous bodily harm to a judge. That's what you came back to. - Don't tell me, Hilda. - I will tell you. I know now. It wasn't even another woman. Sometimes I think you care more for Judge Bullingham than you do for me. Hilda, if you really think that, don't you think you'd be happier back in America? I don't know. - I shall have to think about it. - Is that a threat or a promise? And so, Lord Freith, your younger brother, Roderick Canter, had a fiancée and was engaged to be married? Yes, they'd both dined with me that night at my club. There was absolutely nothing of the Oscar Wildes about Rory. (Colefax) Thank you, Lord Freith. I suppose you have some questions, Mr Rumpole? Just a few. Lord Freith, your club is where? In St James's. After dinner, did Rory drive his fiancée home? - To her flat in Chelsea. - He lives in Eaton Square? Eaton Place, actually. - Another address in southwest London? - Yes. Lord Freith, have you any idea what your brother was doing as far north as Kentish Town? No. As a matter of fact, I've wondered about that. Yes, so have I. So may the Jury. It was nowhere near his route from St James's to Chelsea, was it? - No. - Or from Chelsea to Eaton Place? No. If you're suggesting this gentleman's brother went to Kentish Town for immoral purposes, I think you should put it fair and square. My Lord, although I am well aware the dirty mind is a perpetual feast, I am making absolutely no such suggestion. I'm very glad to hear it. You have told us your late brother was of a profound religious, er, disposition. (Judge) He's told us that! But you didn't altogether approve of his religious views, did you? I didn't approve of all he did, no. Had he given away his farm in Hampshire to the particular religious sect that he favoured? He had. He was staying on as manager. Had he not also given them a great deal of money? I believe he had. - All the money he inherited? - I think most of it. And was his fiancee of the same religious persuasion? - Yes. - She was an American, I believe. Yes. They'd met when Rory was in Florida, playing Polo. I believe she converted him. So... So, he gave all he had to the poor? We have a pretty good precedent for that, Mr Rumpole. Except that you believed he'd given all he had to the rich. Didn't you, Lord Freith? You believed that this organisation was extremely wealthy? I thought perhaps they were exploiting Rory, yes. Perhaps my learned friend would be good enough to give us the name of this alleged organisation? Doesn't my learned friend know it? The name is to be found on the Prosecution's Exhibit One. Usher, if you please. The name is written on this blood-stained piece of paper. It reads, "Sunlight to the Children of the Sun". - "The Children of the Sun". - Yes, that's what they're called. And they offer blood to The Children of the Dark. We've been told that that document was written by your client in the deceaseds blood, Mr Rumpole. My Lord, there has not been one scrap of evidence about it. Colefax has told us that he's calling Professor Ackerman. No man knows more about blood than Ackerman. - Your Lordship will find somebody does. - That would surprise me. Life in Your Lordship's court is full of surprises. I suppose that's why so many of us find it so enormously enjoyable. Have you any further questions to ask Lord Freith? This must be a very painful experience for him. 'Well, it's hardly a night out on the town for my client.' May I have Exhibit Two, please, Usher? I believe your brother went to Sandhurst? Yes, he did. And he spent some five years in the army? Until my father died and left him the farm. Do you know that this is a regulation Army knife issued to officers and men undergoing special commando training? I didn't, but I accept that from you. And didn't your brother tell you he had enjoyed such training during his time in the Army? I believe he said something of the sort, yes. Thank you, Lord Freith. Thank you, Lord Freith. - Your ordeal is over. - 'Ours continues.' What are you up to, Rumpole? Cracknell, perchance you wonder at our show, then wonder on till truth make all things plain. - Who's the next witness? - Inspector Wargrave. At least you won't discuss religion with him. Oh, will I not? I'm not so sure. Detective Inspector, you say my client told you he was guilty? That's what I've got in my notebook. Because you have it in your notebook, it has the authority of Holy Writ? Mr Rumpole! I suggest he never used the word "guilty" at all. My client told you that he had sinned. Doesn't it come to exactly the same thing? Oh, hardly, My Lord. Every clergyman at morning prayers says, "I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is before me." But, that is hardly an admission of stabbing people in the Underground. Inspector, this appears to be the fatal weapon. It would seem so, sir. There were two sets of fingerprints found on this knife, were there not? Those of the deceased and those of my client? That is so, yes. Well, what might that indicate to you, Inspector? It might indicate that there had been some sort of struggle for possession of the knife. I am extremely grateful to Your Lordship. Your Lordship is always the first to appreciate points in favour of the Defence. - Now, Inspector... - We'll break now. - What...? - Be upstanding. Members of the jury, it may come as a relief in this somewhat sordid case to know that England are 85 for 2 in the test at Melbourne. 'Oh, Bullingham, you old... 'That really wasn't cricket!' Oh, dear, oh dear, oh dear! Why the gloom? I get the impression we're doing rather well. There's still the letter, you don't write a letter in your victim's blood not unless it's a deliberate murder. The Master is not bound by the laws of Man and Nature. His is the power of the miraculous. It's no use. You're not going to help me, are you, Duchess, until you lose your faith in miracles? Well, I can tell you, that is about to happen! Prof Ackerman, have you ever tried to write a message of this sort in blood? For the purposes of this case, I did so. It is quite possible, yes. Now, normally, blood clots in two to three minutes, does it not? Yes, but there would have been a continuous supply of blood from the deceased in this case. Quite so, however, Simpson would've had to have written this message while he was still on the platform, and had he taken blood away with him, it would have clotted. That is so, yes. Now, the evidence is that he was unobserved on the platform for a period of about five minutes, between the arrival of trains. He could have written these words in so short a time? It is possible. Oh, possible, yes, but an extremely strange thing to do. The suggestion is, you have an extremely strange type of client. 'Sorry, Duchess, I left myself wide open to that.' Professor, we've known each other many years? Yes, Mr Rumpole, we have. And we have discussed a good many corpses. Is this to be a time of private reminiscences, or do you intend to cross-examine? And of course the jury may not know as much as we do about blood. So, let's get down to basics. Now, everyone's red blood corpuscles are the same, are they not? They are, yes. What varies are the agglutinogens which must combine with the appropriate agglutinin. Mr Rumpole, I'm sure you and the Professor understand... The system can be made perfectly clear to even the simplest mind, by saying that human blood can be classified into four distinct groups which are called Group A, Group B, Group AB and Group O. That is exactly so. Now, Group O is rather common and flows in the veins of 45% of the population. It flowed in the veins of the Honourable Rory Canter. The deceased was class O, yes. Yes, whereas my client is of the 41 to 43% whose blood is A. He is A, yes, from the sample I took from him. Now, you came to the conclusion that the blood that had written this message was class O blood, and therefore likely to be Mr Canter's. It responded to the test in that way. You took a minute fragment of paper, treated it chemically to detect the antigens and examined it under a microscope? Precisely. Professor Ackerman... ...suppose this message had been written months before. Suppose my client had joined some dotty religious sect, a sect which required him to write a motto or an oath in his own blood? It was not his blood group. But suppose it had been, and had been done months before. Would not the antigens have perhaps faded in their strength? I suppose they might. I hadn't considered that. Oh, then consider it now, Professor, I beg you. The various constituents of blood fade with time, do they not? Yes, they do. Blood becomes more difficult to classify? I would say, less easy. Well, less easy, then, yes. Thank you. Now, you found that my client's blood was A and that of the deceased was O, and after that classification you carried out no further tests? No, I did what was asked of me. The situation was perfectly simple. Then, is it not possible that after my client had written this absurd message in his own A blood and kept it, the antigens would have faded and the blood become less easy to classify accurately? That could be so. And in that case, would not the blood on this paper give you, as indeed it did, an O result? I think the hypothesis you advance is a possible one. 'Ah, bless you, Ackerman! 'May you have many happy years in the mortuary ahead of you!' Thank you, Professor. Er, Professor, let me get this quite clear. Are you saying that that letter may have been written by Simpson months before, for some religious reason in his own blood, and has nothing to do with this case? I think that could be so, My Lord. And that you can't be sure, in fact, that it was written in the victim's blood? In view of the possibility that Mr Rumpole has pointed out...no. Yes. Thank you, Professor. I think I understand. 'My dear old Bull, I think you do!' No miracles. No. The universe has recovered its balance. There is a perfectly clear scientific explanation. I suppose so. You can tell the jury the truth now, Mr Simpson. Well, there's nothing to be afraid of. Isn't there? You've got to tell it, Mr Simpson. For your sake? Yes, if you like. But also for the sake of all the other lonely people looking for miracles. Now, Mr Simpson, I would like you to cast your mind back to the summer. - You went on holiday to Florida? - Yes. And did you meet someone in the street handing out flowers? Yes. He seemed so clean and respectable. We started to talk. Yes, yes, go on. Erm, ab-about loneliness and how to make friends. - He took me to meet his friends. - And where were they? In a big house somewhere in the middle of nowhere. They-they sang a lot and they seemed to work very hard. Later, I met their leader. He was dressed a bit like a clergyman. - They called him the Master. - Yeah. And what did, er, the Master have to say to you? He told me I must work for him in their accounts department. He said when the Children of the Sun took over the government of the world I should have some great post in world economics. Mr Simpson, did you believe him? Yes. L-| did. And you started work on the books? - Almost at once. - And what did you find? Oh, there were hopeless discrepancies. A great deal of money was coming in, the friends and brothers gave all their worldly goods. None of this money was accounted for. I came to the conclusion it was all a gigantic swindle. And did you tell that to any of your new-found friends? We weren't allowed any close friends. They told us that would destroy the loyalty to the group. But, there was someone I worked with. I told him one night. He said he'd have to go to the Master and denounce me as a traitor. That's when I decided to escape. Mr Simpson, why didn't you tell all this to the police? I was frightened. I thought... I thought it was a miracle. And how do you feel now that you know it was not a miracle? In away... ...disappointed. No miracle! Perhaps you are disappointed, too, members of the jury, to find this is just another case of human greed and human violence. Mr Simpson had discovered the secret of a gigantic fraud practised upon the gullible and the lonely. Mr Simpson was to be killed, or terrified into silence. And Rory Canter, a fanatic disciple of this bogus Messiah, Canter, a man trained to kill, was to be the agent of death. You have heard of my client's desperate struggle to defend himself, during which the knife accidentally entered his assailant's body. And it was a desperate struggle, members of the jury. For Canter was more dangerous than any thief or sexual molester. He was a man who believed he had God on his side. (Liquid sloshes) (Phyllida) Happy? (Cracknell) Are you? Yes. You had a marvellous win. - Of course, Rumpole did it. - Yes. Blast the man! Rumpole pulled it off! - What's wrong with that? - What's wrong with it? It means he'll never go. He'll be around my neck forever, swamping the desk with his papers and scattering ash like a bloody volcano. That's not why I got him the job. - Why did you get him the job, Ken? - Hmm? Why did you get Rumpole to lead you? It's obvious, isn't it? You wanted him to lose! It seemed a hopeless case anyway. You thought he'd vanish back into the sunset if he lost another case? You got him the job, you wanted him to lose! Yes, I did. He's over the hill and I've got my career to think of. As a radical lawyer? - Well, yes. - Oh, no! Ha! Rumpole's the radical, you're not. You'll grow up to be a Prosecutor, or a Circuit Judge. But Rumpole never will because he says what he thinks, and because he doesn't give a damn what anybody thinks about him. And because he can win cases you're afraid even to do on your own. Oh, come on, Phyll, who do you really care about, him or me? You? Oh, you're a pretty face around Chambers, a little bit of fluff. A reasonably good spot of crumpet. But don't ever think I'd risk a good husband, who knows how to cook, for you, Ken Cracknell. (I Congregation sings "O Come All Ye Faithful") (Engine revving) (indistinct conversations) (Henry) Quiet, everyone, please! Pray silence for our learned Head of Chambers' Yuletide address. Time goes so quickly, it always seems to be Christmas when I drop into Chambers. Happy Christmas, Judge. What are you handing out this festive season, an extra six months with holly on it? Well, er, Christmas has put several gifts in our stockings this year. Rumpole has won his murder at the Old Bailey. Oh, did that surprise anybody? It surprised Ken. Rumpole does have a talent for getting murderers off. I'm not sure I find that particularly reassuring. Owen Glendour Owen has been appointed to the Circuit Bench. (Rumpole) That's splendid news! My dear, Owen, welcome to the Bench. You'll find it a rather lonely life, I'm afraid. But there are compensations, you don't give a damn who wins. Which, of course, leaves an empty place in my old room. Er...yes. Well, we'll discuss that, of course, at a Chambers meeting. - Meanwhile... - Meanwhile? We'll discuss it now, hmm? No, I-I'm sure it's a matter you'll want to discuss with your family. I don't think so, Guthrie. We don't want to drag you back because we have a gap in Chambers. - I'm sure Hilda has views. - Yes, as a matter of fact, I have. Oh, well, Mrs Rumpole. Since we got back from our holiday in the States with our son... Did she say holiday? I thought they'd gone out to grass for good. ...and since Rumpole has got back in harness and he has won a most important case in a murder trial, I'm quite convinced that his real love is Judge Bullingham. - Oh, really, Hilda; - I'm joking, of course. Most amusing speaker, your wife. But I'm also convinced that my duty is to be beside Rumpole. So I shall stay in England and look after Rumpole. Are you sure, Hilda? And we're all so glad to be back in this happy family of Chambers. Oh, lovely. How long will you be staying with us this time, Horace? How long? Oh, who knows how long? You know, I well remember that awful old Lord Chief when I was first at the Bar. He gave an eighty-year-old man fifteen years for persistent theft at Bodmin Assizes. "But, My Lord," the old man said, "I shall never do fifteen years." "Well," the old Lord Chief encouraged him, "you must just do as much of it as you can." (Laughter) And I will do just as much of it as I can. And a very merry Christmas to you, too.
