I'm 17 years old. Never I've been away from home before. What... Wait! Let's get him. Behind the black! I will not tell send the black man to jail. I will not say to condemn you to death. "You raped that girl!" - I was in a fight. I was just fighting with white boys. "You raped that girl!" "I did not see any girl. He held a knife against her neck. "I did not rape anyone. Guilty or innocent, let's go get rid of these blacks. Good day sir. O Mr. Wolcoff is looking for you. "Do you remember Leonard George?" "Yes, of course I remember. "How are you, Lenny?" - Very well. I saw that the verdict of Coll became headline. If I were to receive a penny to every case that wins ... Would stay on the Ferris wheel of Coney Island all summer long. I want you to meet a friend of mine. - How are you? - Pleasure. William is the head of an organization ... known as Defense International Labor Office. That is, Communist Party. Let me ask you a question. Why DIT is so interested in these boys? They represent a nation of millions of people oppressed ... fighting against dehumanization, and inequality that ... I'm not interested politician here, Mr. Patterson. We win cases with facts, not rhetoric. These boys pick up of the guards every day. And to make matters worse, they think that the world has forgotten them. We do not have the money to pay it. I would not take any money for this case. And you do not have to like me nor of what I defend. But for these boys ... may be the only way out. It is the transcript of the Scottsboro trial. A jury of twelve white farmers ... took twenty minutes to consider him guilty. Take a look. I expect talk to you again. "It was good to see you, Sam. "Lenny, too. Twenty minutes. We're talking from the south. You will never find a twelve-man jury ... to absolve nine boys blacks from a rape charge. You can not win in Alabama. Honey, how was your day? The usual. The boys can hardly wait let baseball begin. Marjorie thinks that piano it's a waste of time. She wants to tap. Is that you? "I could not put my shoes on." - Very funny. Leonard George came to see me today. He asked me if I want work in the case of Scottsboro. If you go there, come back with one head less. "Where is Mr. Earl?" - It was coffee. Can you take a look at my article? And then? The composition is good, but the model is wrong. - As well? He put the word black in quotation marks. When you use colloquialism, Do not call attention to it, Calvin. "That makes you look pretentious." "Maybe I want to look pretentious." Mr. Earl? Remember the story we publish a year ago about the Scottsboro case? - Yes I recall. - Look this. The Scottsboro verdict was overturned. The Federal Supreme Court has ordered a new trial for the nine defendants. And the vote for a new trial was seven to two. Seven to two, Mr. Earl. It is unprecedented that the Supreme Federal Court ... It's a great story, sir. Someone has to go over there to cover it. Someone has to do this. I agree. This story has to be covered. You can go, William. I doubt I'll find support there, but if you send the story, we will publish it. One of them held a knife in my neck while the others raped me. As soon as one ended, the other began. It seemed to last for hours. I was with Victoria when they got into the freight car. They took off my overalls. I got stuck... while they ... they had relations with me. I do not know how much time it took. I have no idea. I can only say ... to hide it. Hide them all. "We, the jury ... we consider the defendants guilty of charges ... and we sentenced them to death in electric chair. May the Lord have mercy of their souls. " The kids are sleeping. The press in the south arrived at its peak, Belle. And they continue. Each article, each subject is more cruel than the last. Listen to this. "The charge against the nine blacks seems to be the most revolting ... in the criminal records of our state. The girls attack has Such horrible details ... that facts can not be printed. Looks like there are still savages on the loose. Let us have the comfort of knowing ... that we are at least up of the justice of the savages. " And this continues. Those boys did not even have a chance. The twins want to know if can go to a Dodger game ... when you go to Alabama. Do not say. I have to go. I mean... I asked you not to tell me. What can I do? Belle, can I read this to you? Belle, what are you doing? One page is missing. That's it, a page is missing. - What are you doing? - A pair of extra socks. Socks? Belle, I'm sure that there are socks in Alabama. What kind of socks? And if there is a storm or a flood? I'll never get tired of seeing this. I work with insurance. You can get insurance against almost everything nowadays. Fire, theft, tornadoes, floods. Yes, say and you will be assured. - It is true. "I'm talking like an old street man. Do not. - What is your job? - I'm a lawyer. A lawyer? Why did not you say it before? - Now I feel silly. - Because? Trying to sell you something which will not be useful to you. "What good would it do?" - Do not know. It's all right. Do you know the true of the word security? - Which is? - "It's a game of chance ... in which the player can take advantage the comfortable conviction ... ... that he's winning. the man who has the bench. " What a northern lawyer does it in the south of Mason-Dixon? I'm on my way to Decatur, Alabama. I'm going to defend the boys from Scottsboro. The blacks who raped two girls on the freight train. - No, that's what everyone says, but ... "They do not need defense." They need a rope stuck in their necks until they die. All of them. Anyone who says otherwise is lover of blacks and a damn idiot. But I hope you find out for yourself. I expected it. "How are you, Wade?" - Magnificent. My son grows like grass. Those blacks are receiving more attention ... than a blind man in a gallery of shots. I'm afraid it's just the beginning, Wade. Before they are finished, they will be selling tickets in front of the court. I never thought it would come to that, Tom. I need a good right arm. Someone familiar, someone who understands the finer points of Alabama law. You're not going to drag me into this case, Tom. I will not leave any northerner come to my city ... and tell me how to care of my business. This will not happen. Great! He's Jewish. As? The northerner is called Leibowitz. He's Jewish. Of course yes. I thought you should know. Excuse. Can you tell me where it is? the Cornelian Arms Hotel? That way, on the edge of town. For there? On the edge of town. "Good morning, Elizabeth. - Good morning, Judge. Good morning, Judge. The newspapers ... It's ok. It's twenty cents. I think these locks are here from Jefferson Davis. I can try? - I appreciate it. - Clear. Yes. It's very hot. Can you repeat that, son? I'm looking for men like you to sign my petition. Your what? I write for a newspaper. They said that I need signatures of workers ... to enter court. Yes, put the hay there. I just got back from Chicago. - I need signatures. - Subscriptions? To sit in a white men's court? I hoped so. The people here are not going to give it to you. your names just because you asked. In addition, it is not advisable to a Negro walk in Sunday clothes ... on a weekday. The whites they'll think you're arrogant. Okay then. Sorry to bother you. I did not want to disrespect them. Have a good day. Wait. Come back here, my friend. Come here. Let me see that. I'll sign it. Everyone here. I appreciate it. - Mr. Leibowitz, I'm Joe Brodsky from DIT. - How are you? - This is Mr. George Chamlee. - How are you? - Nice to meet you. - Equally. We told the boys that and they were very excited. Lets go in? Yes sir. Time to get up. I will not talk again, son. My name is Sam Leibowitz, I'm from new york. I will take care of the defense of you from now on. The farmers and merchants of Scottsboro put them here ... but they do not have the last word. Good. Your judgment will be the first. Followed by Clarence ... ... and Eugene will be the last. Where is Eugene? Right here. He does not talk much. No one from his family came to see him ... almost two years ago. Let's make a very good defense. The truth will appear in court. I promise. Everyone will have a fair trial. Mr. Leibowitz? Yes. There are not enough blacks to defend in New York? I'll let you get this one, but Do not you ever talk to me like that again. Now I want you to calm down ... and try not to worry ... and we will do everything for you. How long have you been giving candy and cigarettes to prisoners? Since we arrived. I understand. Is this how DIT operates? Leave the boys happy because they signed your contract. I do not mind to facilitate a little life for them. I'll tell you what the Bad on it, Mr. Brodsky. If the promoter comes here and to see the prisoners ... receiving special treatment, will use this information in court. And you will not find a only jury in Alabama ... to vote for the acquittal. This is evil. Mr. Leibowitz, we've been here for weeks. I think we know what it is. best for our customers. Mr. Brodsky, I suggest that you find a better way to be useful. Good. Now, listen to me. I have come from New York here so that these boys have a fair trial. This can be done there and here in Alabama ... if done correctly. Right. How did you get the scar on your face? "A soldier did this to me. - Soldier? Yes sir. It happened at the Scottsboro trial. During the trial? I was in court ... while one of the girls was witnessing ... and an officer leaned over me and asked me if I would testify. I said no. Who knew nothing about the trial. So they took me to a room behind where the judge sits ... and they beat me up. They hit me so hard I thought they were going to kill me. While they beat me, they said, "Now you're going to talk? And they kept repeating. After a while, no I bore and said yes. And on the way out ... a soldier hit me with the bayonet. Welcome to Montgomery, lawyers. - It is a pleasure to be here. "Why do not you sit down?" What can I do for you? We met up with Leroy Wright, in the Birmingham prison. He states that he was assaulted by an officer in Scottsboro. Apparently a soldier started a piece of her chin with a bayonet. I did not hear anything about it. As a former public prosecutor ... and esteemed member of the Superior Alabama court ... we think maybe order an investigation. Investigation? Do not you think we should leave the black to identify the man who cut it off? Bring the boy. I will see to it that justice is done. Is good to hear that. I'm sure he'll be happy. to travel along with the white officer ... that left a scar on his face. Mr. Leibowitz, ... some of us read and write ... and wear one leg at a time, like you. Sir, I do not have intolerance and racial hatred. But believe me when I tell you ... that we understand black ... and we know how to deal with it. Let me ask you something. Why Blacks in Alabama can not be on the jury? "We do not need to talk about it. - I need. I am compelled to do so. The New York Bar Association will accuse me of professional negligence ... unless I claim that the indictment was flawed. But I'll tell you what you can do. You can avoid this question. As? All you have to do is remove the charges and cancel all that. You can go straight to hell. If I go, sir ... You will come with me. I assure you that. With all due respect, Mr. Leibowitz, I do not think it's appropriate ... talk to a member of the Supreme Alabama court that way. Why not, George? Is he going to judge the case? "No, but your son does. - Exactly. I'm not a student of first year of law. I'm not a soldier for the cause. Mr. Chamlee and I debated this case in the Federal Supreme Court. And we got a new one. trial for these boys. I'm sorry if I offended you. This is a list of doctors, teachers and professionals ... who live and work in Morgan County. Everyone on this list is qualified to be on the jury. And everyone on the list is black. Thanks. How are you today, Haywood? The girls said that they took the freight train ... from Huntsville to Chattanooga to look for work. They said they night in a hostel on the road. When they did not find work in the mills the next day ... They took the train back home. Down below is the Walker's Grove. Yes, the wanderers go there when they need a place ... to spend the night and set up a campfire. Does anyone live there? Spent the night there some years and never left. Mr. Lewis? Can I talk to you for a minute? We just want to help those boys And just what we want to do. Help those kids. How are you? I thought it would be good to go over some things this afternoon. This is the freight car. You know I do not want to condemn no one who is not guilty. I just want the truth. I already told you the truth. What was Victoria Price wearing? A coat... men's overalls, a dress ... and panties underneath. I need to understand that right. The train leaves. 45 min later, a of workers back ... to report a fight in which they'd been involved minutes before. And they called the sheriff, who called his officer ... and ordered him to arrest all blacks who left the train at the station. It makes no sense. Do you remember how it went? Tell Mr. Knight what happened in the freight wagon. Come on, count. Ladies. How are you? Can you sign it for me, please? Here it is. - Go ahead, sign it. - Thank you. In between! My name is William Lee. I write for the Chicago National. They told me that I needed a petition with names of Alabama residents ... to enter the court. Here is the petition, sir. Did you come from Chicago? Yes, sir, I came. A young man like you can scare a jury. Not to mention the scare that this city can give it to you. I'm aware of that, Judge. "And you want to go to court?" - Yes, sir, I do. - Because? - Good... I believe that people deserve to hear more than one side of the story, sir. Good... I'll see what we can do. Is the catfish biting? First, I tried liver of chicken and crayfish. Now I'm out of bait. I do not know why I come Here. I never catch fish. I just burn. Mom said I wanted to ... What? - She said she wanted to see me. "Give me the metal bucket." Yeah, you better be prepared, boy. They will attack you with force. The court will be full of journalists and nervous neighbors. Let's show that the Justice in Alabama ... is so fair and impartial as elsewhere. I do not want this to come back. to the Supreme Court. The governor is watching you, Tom. Sir? As far as I know, he does not to re-elect. If you take good care of this case ... may be your ticket to Montgomery. Good morning, Judge. Welcome to Alabama. All standing. Please sit down. Before we start the selection of the jury ... the defense has a motion to do, Mr. Leibowitz? Yes, Excellency. Thank you. I want to call a witness and ask that Mr. James Benson ... be under oath this time. The State does not object. Mr. Benson. Place your left hand over the Bible and lift the right. Solemnly swears to tell truth, the whole truth ... and nothing more than Truth, may God help you? - Swear. - Sit down. - Mr. Benson. - Yes. He is one of the commissioners of the jury. Jackson County, correct? Yes sir. I am also the editor of "Scottsboro Progressive Age" ... and member of the Association of Alabama Press. I'm the president. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Do you recognize this book? Yes sir. It's the list of jurors of Jackson County. For all you know, there are names of black people who live ... and work in the county of Jackson on this list of jurors? Not that I know of, sir. It's a great book. "There are several names here, right?" - Yes sir. But no black. Can you explain... why the blacks were excluded from this book? It is question of selection, sir, not exclusion. Some black people have a good reputation ... but were not well trained to act as jurors. Because? They have no capacity for judgment. And I would say the same about of the women of the people. I understand. Let me ask you a question. The trial of a black man, ... pastor, teacher or deacon ... is worse than a illiterate white man? No, sir, many blacks have a good education ... but they lack character. When speaking character, Does it mean honesty? Yes, sir, some blacks steal. - I did not know that. - Yes. Did not know. I told you before that you were who were not trained. What does it mean? Can you tell court what do you mean training? They are trained every day of your life in what you do. Are they trained with what they do in life? But this has nothing to do with the jury service ... because this is something that any citizen who lives in the USA ... of suitable age and without criminal record can do. I'd say it's a fair interpretation of the code? Yes sir. So, in fact, there could be in this book, but there is not. - Right. - Thank you, that's all. Yes sir. You may withdraw, sir. Excellence,... the defense motion ... is canceling the indictment ... because blacks were excluded from jury lists of Jackson County. Motion denied. Please, call your first candidate. Your Excellency, I ask the Court to examine the list of Morgan County jurors. For what purpose? For the purpose of determining how many blacks were selected ... - to serve as jurors. - Judge? If you permit me... Mr Leibowitz, I see that there are members of the black community ... in court today. I suggest that we start the procedure, calling these candidates first. After all, it looks like it's going follow that same path. Thank you, Your Excellency. I would like to introduce my first candidate. Sir, I want to ask if it's a professional if you have a job. Yes sir. - And you're over 18 years old? - Yes sir. - Any criminal convictions? - No sir. Okay, you've already been invited. to participate in a jury? - No sir. - Because? One by one, the blacks were called to testify ... businesspeople, doctors, educators, civil leaders. Many had higher education complete. Some, more than one. More than a dozen of the best of Morgan County ... presented himself to the court, the press and the nation. Above all, Leibowitz proved that qualified blacks ... were deliberately excluded of the jury service in Alabama. And they continued to be excluded. How is today? I can not help it if not help yourself. You will not talk. All right, Haywood, it will be your way. Sheriff! How are you, sir? Good to see you. Remember, son, who are your neighbors and this is your yard. All standing up! The Honorable Judge James Edwin Horton chairs. Please bring the jury. Let the indictment be read. The grand jury accuses Haywood Patterson ... to rape Victoria Price and Ruby Bates ... against peace and dignity of the State of Alabama. Thank you. Please call your first witness. The State calls for Miss. Victoria Price. Solemnly swears to tell truth, the whole truth ... and nothing more than Indeed, may God help her? - Swear. - Please sit down. "Your name is Victoria Price?" - Yes sir. On March 25, 1931, where did he live? That day I was on a freight train, traveling through Jackson County? Yes sir. Was there anyone else with you on that train? Where was the train? In the freight wagon. While the train he continued his journey ... Did anyone else get into the freight wagon? Some black people entered. And what did the defendant do? He helped me get undressed. What clothes were you wearing? Overalls, shirt ... dress, panties ... a coat and a feminine hat. MS. Price ... Please, check out these clothes. Were you wearing those panties? Yes sir. "We present it as evidence. - Excellency, objection. The panties were not shown on the first Scottsboro trial. But now, yes. This court will not allow clutter. I'll empty the court. if necessary. If they can not contain their feelings, the right place is out there. Did this defendant have a relationship with you? Yes sir. MS. Price ... resisted the defendant? I fought while I could. The witness is yours. Good. O... I should call her Miss. Price or Mrs. Price? Mrs. Price. It is very similar to a freight car, right? No sir. Does not it look like a freight car for you? No sir. Like your load is different from that? The freight wagon on which I was much older. This is a toy. Right. Yes, of course. How old was he ... ... on March 25, 1931? He was 21 years old. Where was born? Lincoln County, Tennessee. - What day and year? - On the 20th of January. What year? Do you have to think about it? To discover? I do not remember what day I was born. Do not you remember the day you were born? What's it? Can not Think fast enough? Find out how much is 1931 minus 21? - Protest. - Protest maintained. MS. Price ... came here today, prepared ... to say that this defendant ... - You raped her? - Protest. Yes. "Have you ever been raped before?" - No sir. I did not go. At? No, sir, I did not go. Do you know a man named Jack Tiller? Yes sir. She was your boyfriend, was not she? Yes sir. And you two have been convicted together for obscenity? Protest. It does not matter if she has been convicted for 40 crimes, the charge is rape. She has never been convicted of commit adultery with a Negro. Is that what the defense wants to show? Protest maintained. I will prove, Your Excellency, that Mrs Price had relations with blacks several times. And I'll prove it without a shadow of a doubt. So try instead of saying. Excellency, I present as evidence ... an attestation of conviction case number 5437 ... town of Huntsville. Protest. It's insignificant and irrelevant. It is a certified copy and shows that Mrs. Price ... was convicted of adultery. Yes, it's the code of the city of Huntsville. And it's adultery. - Protest denied. - Excellency ... I do not know if the witness understands the meaning of adultery. Yeah, I'll explain to her. I explain to her, Thank you, Mr. Leibowitz. Adultery means live with a man without being married. It means having sex with him without being married to him. You see? - You see? - Yes sir. You can go on. "Thank you, Your Excellency. So we all know that Mrs. Price ... has already been convicted of adultery. MS. Price, you know one man named Lester Carter? No sir. Never heard of him in your life? No sir. Wait a minute. Has... Are you sure about that? I'm sure. MS. Price, I'll ask again. ... and I'll give you a chance to change your response if you want. He knew Lester Carter before of March 25, 1931? At? I think I met him on the Scottsboro Prison. Sorry, you think you met him ... or did you meet him at the Scottsboro jail? I met him in Scottsboro jail. So you know Lester Carter. I know one thing! That those blacks and Haywood Patterson raped me. I think you're a bit of an actress, Mrs. Price. - Excellency ... - You're a good actor, too ... Mr. Leibowitz. Let me see if I can refresh your memory ... about what happened in Chattanooga. Arrived there with Ruby and Lester on the afternoon of March 24. They walked along the rails, where found Orville Gilley. So you four went down even a grove of trees ... called the Walker's Grove. I've never been to a place. called Grove of Walkers. Nor is it true, Ms. Price ... who is known to have spent the night ... in the hut of a black man named Lewis ... on several occasions beyond of that? In the same forest? Protest. This line of interrogation is a discussion with the witness. Excellency, the promoter public asked me to prove ... Mrs Price's association with the blacks. I'll prove it now. Are you hoping to continue and prove the call? I'll continue to where You allow me to. Protest denied. Is it a picture of you and Ruby Bates? - It's me and Ruby Bates. - Wait a minute. Excellency, the public prosecutor said he could not prove ... her association with blacks. Here's a picture of that. Protest. - It does not show when or where ... "And you and Ruby Bates?" Yes sir. Okay, I present this photo as evidence. Mrs. Price, who's Callie Brochie? A woman in Chattanooga. And what does she have to do with you? She hosted me and Ruby Bates when we went to Chattanooga. Are you sure? I'm sure. As he was sure about Lester Carter, before I give you a chance ... to correct the record, because actually knew him, right? I... I should have said that the name Callie Brochie ... which was presented as the girl who hosted it ... is actually the name of a pension girl used in a fictional story of the "Saturday Evening Post". "Is not that where you got the name?" - That's absurd! I want to make a statement. I do not think the court should allow the use of this photograph. Are you sure you do not Want to change your story? Can change the story about Callie Brochie ... Being seen close to a non-black it means having relations with him ... - How did you change your story about Lester? "As the defense wants us to believe." - Change your story! - It's a rape case! - Gentlemen, please. - You can change your story several times ... - But this photo ... - Mr. Leibowitz. Speak for yourself. MS. Price, ... the reason for making these accusations ... it's because I was wandering on a train ... and thought she would be arrested for vagabondage ... for being in the company of blacks? And to save himself, he alleged rape? No sir. I have no further questions. Do you have socks? Yes, under the sweets, in the drawers down there. - They're soft. - It's all right. Right. - Good afternoon. - Judge. Mr. Leibowitz. - Good afternoon, Judge. - Good afternoon. Taking advantage of the rain? Beautiful rain. Can you give me a can of grease, please? You are having trouble to find what you want? Not... You want to tell me something? Yes, I have something in mind, Judge, and I hope you do not consider it inappropriate. Why did you accept this case? It's a strange question coming from you. Could have refused for reasons and avoided this confusion. Just like you. After this is over, I'm going back to New York. You live here. Let me ask you for that you accepted this case. Those boys never had a chance of truth. Not adequately defended in the first trial. So I thought ... good... To answer your question ... I come from a long line of lawyers and judges, Mr. Leibowitz ... and if you wanted to avoid this confusion, as he called it ... would have chosen another occupation. I'm here listening to this case, tried to find out the truth ... and that's what I'm going to do. My only interest is doubt my obligation ... is to get justice done. In short, that's it. "It's good to see the sun again, is not it?" - Yes. - See you later. - Bye, Judge. Is it cold lemonade? I think so. Would you like to drink with me? Clear. A bit of... Do not. Thank you. Beautiful night. Yes, beautiful night. It's a quiet moment. When the sun goes down, we can smell of eucalyptus in the air. A Famous Southern Writer was referring to this ... like the secret shadow of the approaching night. Gave a show both in court today, Mr. Leibowitz ... and I do not remember the last one I got a beating. Yes well... we're just in the beginning. I bet the little dogs they saw the belly for you. The little dogs, yes. This is good, I have to remember it. Things are slower. here, Mr. Leibowitz ... and I do not know if Alabama is ready for a city guy like you. But I have to admit that I admire your tenacity. And I say it as a compliment. So, I accept. It was a long day. Thanks for the drink. "Under rigorous interrogation, Samuel S. Leibowitz, of New York ... Victoria Price clung to the story of Haywood Patterson ... was one of the six blacks who attacked her with savagery ... ... on a freight train of Alabama two years ago. " Yes, that was ... There is also a letter of a local minister. "Mr. Leibowitz, you dirty reputation of one of the best young people in Alabama. What a shame." Got it ... like the trees ... seem to grow in different directions here? - The trees? - Yes, the trees. I mean,... it's like... each branch ... I tried to reach ... the sun, but in different directions. I mean, it's ... a variety of trees and ... There are a variety of trees. Mr. Leibowitz. Good Morning. Yes, I saw him in court, making notes on his desk. It seems like the good people of Alabama They want to keep us in our places. Yes,... but made some friends here. Thank you. I see now, Governor. Do not worry, we have a case strong. We'll get a conviction. So far, no problem. nor a sign of violence. Where were they? In the same room. Good,... When did you attack Victoria? Price attacked her honor. "And everything they stand for here." - Wait, her honor? Mr. Knight, sir. Yes. - Ruby Bates is missing. - What? How are you missing? You can not come to the south ... and hope to win such a case. I said what I wanted, but cases are overdue with evidence and facts. You do not need it, son. Victoria Price already gave her story and the jury heard loud and clear. Defend the boys. Make them see you as human beings ... and maybe they have a chance. It was a pleasure to meet you. And I hope we can discuss this again, in the future. Let's go over there. How are you, sir? The State calls Dr. R. R. Bridges. On March 25, 1931, the Have you examined Victoria Price? Yes sir. And when he examined Victoria Price on that occasion ... it was evident to you that Had she had sex? - Yes sir. - And it is possible, in your opinion ... that nine men had had relations with her? - Protest. - Denied. It's possible. Thank you, doctor. Dr. Bridges, when these two women went to your office ... Were any of them hysterical? - No sir. As a doctor ... can conceive, imagine, that two women ... through the horrible experience of being raped by nine blacks ... and being thrown from a freight wagon ... and appear in the office no sign of hysteria? Protest. Dr. Bridges, the male egg is called a sperm. - Yes sir. "And he moves like a tadpole." "It has a head, a body, and a tail." - Right. And if you removed a spermatozoon or tadpole of a woman's womb ... and put it in a microscope, would you see it move? Yes sir. Under favorable conditions, how much time can a sperm ... live inside a woman? About 24 h. You have removed a sperm from Victoria Price? - Yes sir. - When? The afternoon of the 25th. And put the spermatozoon in a microscope? - Yes sir. "Was he moving?" No sir. He was without mobility. In other words, he was dead. - No mobility means dead. - Yes sir. So the most you can say is that the two women had sex. With how many men and when it happened ... "No one can say. - No sir. - Not a doctor. - No sir. Thank you very much. You may withdraw, sir. Excellency, the State calls Dr. Marvin H. Lynch. Judge,... ... Dr. Lynch should be our next witness, ... but his testimony would be only one repetition of Dr. Bridges' testimony. I do not see why to call him ... and I ask that he be exempt from the testimony. Very well. - It's all right? - Yes. "If you know what's best for you ... buy a ticket for the first train. We do not need your justice here. Leave our blacks alone. " It is not signed, of course. Can I call and ask what Be here taking care of you. "No, it's just a letter. "Just call me." Only that. Yes. Thank you. The defense calls Lester Carter. Who introduced you to Ruby Bates? And where did you and Ruby Bates meet? On the rails of Huntsville. And he spent that night with Ruby in an enclosed car. - Yes sir. "How would you travel to Chattanooga?" In the freight train. And who would? The three of us decided to go it alone. "Victoria, Ruby, and you." - Yes sir. When he got back on the train in the morning Next went to Paint Rock? I stayed on the train until blacks are arrested. I want you to look at us. Eyes and tell me the truth. He saw the defendant, or another person that day ... attack or rape Victoria Price or Ruby Bates? No sir. Thank you, Lester. Thank you. No further questions, Your Excellency. He was chasing an ass in the pasture when the freight train passed? That's when I saw the "blacks" and the white girl in the freight wagon. One of them grabbed her and tossed her into the wagon. "This picture from your farm?" - Yes sir. Right. I studied it ... and from that position, side of the stack of firewood ... it seems that the barn blocked the view of the rails on one side ... and the house blocked on the other side. are you sure of Did you see a girl on the train? I think so. She wore women's clothing. Wore women's clothes? She did not wear overalls. or a female coat? No, a dress. Do you own a car? "Yes, sir, a Ford pickup." A great vehicle. He Can you run? Of course yes. Tell me something. If you saw a white woman being attacked ... by a Negro on a train ... Why did not you jump in? your powerful pickup truck ... and informed the police or complained to anyone? Why did not you do that? I have no further questions. Willie, why was he in that freight train two years ago? Well I... I was going to the clinic. For what purpose? Did you suffer from any illness at the time? Yes, sir, he suffered. I had syphilis ... and gonorrhea. Willie, I do not want to embarrass you, ... but if you can count to the jury, please ... the condition of their intimate parts at the time. Protest, Excellency. We do not want to hear that. I hold the protest. Could you walk that day, Willie? No sir. I had to use my cane. Had relations with woman that day? No, sir, I did not. Thank you,... Mr. Roberson.

I was taught when was crawling. My father learned that way, the father him before him and so on. Things are like this. But it does not make them right. When I was eleven, I memorized the Gettysburg Address. I can recite them from behind to front, anyway. Most Americans can recite a line or two ... and remember the reason why what the speech was made. But they do not know if Lincoln was invited ... to talk about something he thought about. The main speaker of the day was famous. His speech took two hours. No one remembers his name today. Lincoln, his speech ... his speech lasted two minutes. I carry this with me and ... It's from Lincoln. "The world will not even notice remember for a long time Whatever we say here ... but will never forget what they did here. " Stay. "That's right. - Let's kill them.

This defendant has the right to a fair and decent trial. Any man who tries solve that outlaw ... do not need protection of the State of Alabama ... and the citizenship they enjoy. I have no patience with the spirit of gentalha. And if there are meetings where such matters are discussed ... those who attend these meetings they should be ashamed of themselves.

I suggest you go straight to the matter, Mr. Leibowitz. Yes, Your Excellency, I will straight to the point now. In your opinion,... would be sitting here today and would by this judgment if it were white? Protest. Excellence... I will deny the objection. It's his opinion. Would not be. Where would I be? Going to school, maybe. Somewhere far from here. May I ask you a question very important;... perhaps the most important of your life? Did you rape Victoria Price? No sir. I certainly did not rape her. Thank you. Good. Yes sir. Do you consider rape a serious crime? Yes sir. He was tried for this crime in Scottsboro? I was charged in Scottsboro. Who told you to use the word "incriminated"? Nobody. I meant. Good,... I do not know what this means. But I know what that means. Let me read something for you. When asked in Scottsboro ... "You saw the other blacks rape that girl? "... you answered, "I saw all but three"? It's wrong. They asked you ... "Say the names of those who raped that girl "... and you answered, "I do not know your names"? It's wrong. I told Ozzie Powell at Kilby Prison ... "If I had killed those girls, I would not be here. " Protest. The witness was coerced under pressure ... during that trial, before the trial ... since the trial, and right now, right now. "You said it or not ..." - No sir! Did not say! All right, Haywood. So I think this registration is wrong. Mr. Knight, just because he made a It does not mean it's true. With all due respect, Mr. Chamlee.

I have to tell you something. Since I've been here, you know what I think? Without fail. That summer in Pines. You playing the piano, it was a girl ... Waiting on the side of out of my cabin. Waiting outside of your cabin the next morning ... you appeared and I said: "I'll tell your parents ... ... that I love their daughter and that ... " That she was going to marry she. Did you forget that part? I did not forget. I remembered of what his father said. "Get a number and wait in line." And I said, "Yes, but the difference ... ... I'm going to marry her. " You know... be prepared when you go to court. It's not very good. IS... Everyone is talking about this case. "You must be proud of Sam," they tell me. "It should be nice to know that he fights for a good cause. " To say the truth, I feel safer here ... than at home, waiting the phone rings. Wait and not know what goes happening is the hard part. I'm sorry to make you go through that. I made both of us go through this. I do not regret it. Are you sorry you accepted? Do not. - All right, let's go ... - All up! Sit down.

Victoria never told you what to say, ... because you were raped by those boys. And now you're ashamed of admit. Is not that the truth, Ruby? It's not the truth, so How are you sitting here? No sir. I've never been raped by anyone in my life. I have no further questions for this witness, Your Excellency. You can withdraw. Excellency, the defense ends. Very well.
