Long ago there lived a sailor, who bravely sailed the seas. He only failed to conquer the Cape of Storms. Thus he boldy swore never to rest before he did. Satan heard this vow. and held him to his word. Since then has the sailor been damned to sail the seas. Immune to crag and storm. To this day, horror seizes all sailors who catch sight of him. But once every seven years is the wretched one allowed ashore. Should he find the love of a woman. true to him unto death... THE FLYING DUTCHMAN A film based on Richard Wagner's opera How often have I thrown myself with longing into the ocean's depths. There where the ships lie wrecked, I drove my ship into the abyss! Nowhere a grave! Death never comes! This is the dread sentence of damnation. I ask you. Blessed angel of God. Who won for me the condition of my salvation: was I the unfortunate object of your mockery. When you revealed to me the path to my deliverance? Empty hope! Dreadful vain delusion! Everlasting faith no longer exists on earth! Only one hope remains for me. Only one stands unshaken: Though the earth still sprouts its seeds. It too must one day perish! Day of Judgement! Doomsday! When will you dawn and end my night? When will the boom of destruction toll and with the world collapse? You worlds, cease your course! Eternal extinction. Fall upon me! Eternal extinction. Fall upon us! Now helmsman. You will take the watch for me. There's no danger. But it's good to keep watch. Have no fear! Sleep well, captain. With thunder and storm from distant seas am I close to you. My dear. Across towering waves from the south. My dear. I am here! Thanks to the south wind. my dear. I bring you a golden band. Oh, dear south wind. why don't you blow? My girl'd like the bauble. Were there no south wind. dear... Hey! Helmsman! It's nothing, nothing! Oh, dear south wind. blow some more! My girl... You see nothing? Right! You're keeping watch, my boy! There's a ship there. How long were you asleep? Oh drat! Forgive me, captain. Who's there? Who's there? It appears they are just as lazy as we. Answer! Ship and flag? Stop. Methinks I see the captain! Hey! Sailor! Name yourself! And from what land? I come from afar. Will you deny me. A place to anchor in this wind and weather? God bless! Sailors know hospitality! Who are you? Dutchman! God bless you! Has the storm driven you too to this naked, rocky beach? I couldn't be doing better: my home is only a few miles away. Nearly there. I had to turn away again. Say. whence come you? Have you any damage? My ship is sturdy. There is no damage. Grant me for a little while your house and your friendship. You'll not regret it. My ship is rich with treasures from all regions and zones. If you wish to trade. It will surely be to your advantage. How wonderful! But shall I take your word? It appears an unlucky star has pursued you until now. To be of help. I'll offer what I can. But may I ask. May I ask. What your ship contains? The rarest of treasures, priceless pearls. The most precious of gems. Look here, and convince yourself of the worth of this prize that I offer you for a hospitable roof. How? ls it possible? These treasures! Who is so rich as to pay such a price? The price? I just named it. This for a single night's shelter! Yet what you see is only the smallest part of what my ship bears. Of what use is this treasure? I have neither wife nor child. And I'll never find my home. I offer you all my riches. If with you and yours you give me a new home. What do I hear? Do you have a daughter? Yes indeed, a faithful child. She shall be my wife! What? Did I hear him right? My daughter, his wife? He proposed it himself. I fear if I remain undecided. He will change his mind. - Oh! I'm without wife and child! - Am I awake or dreaming? - Nothing binds me to this earth. - Could a suitor be more welcome? - Fate's pursued me relentlessly. - Iâ€™d be a fool to pass this up. - Torment was my companion. - Gladly, I accept, gladly. - Accept the bond of marriage. - I'd be a fool to pass this up. - Please take it. - Gladly, gladly. - Please, take my treasure! - Gladly, I accept. Indeed, stranger, I have a beautiful daughter, devoted to me with a child's love. She is my pride. My most prized possession, my comfort in sorrow. My joy in happiness. May she always love her father. If she is true to him. She will be true to her spouse. You give jewels. Priceless pearls. But the greatest treasure is a faithful woman. Will you give this to me? I give you my word. Your lot moves me. Your generosity reveals your nobility and intelligence. I've wished for such a suitor. Were your wealth less great. I still would want no other. My thanks. Will I see your daughter today? The next favorable wind will bring us home. You shall see her. and if you like her... Then she's mine! Will she be my angel? When, from the fearful violence of my agony. Longing drives me toward deliverance, am I allowed to cling to my one remaining hope? Bless you. Bless the force of the storm that drove me to this shore. When, from the fearful violence of my agony. Longing drives me toward deliverance, Bless the force of the storm - Am I allowed to hold on to -that drove me to this shore. - The one hope that remains to me. - Bless you winds as well. - I'll give my house and daughter. - I give myself over to hope. South wind! South wind! Oh, dear south wind. blow some more! Whirl and hum, good wheel, happily keep on turning. Spin, spin a thousand threads, good wheel, whirl and hum. My love is out at sea. He thinks of home and his sweet child. My good wheel, roll and roar. Oh, if you made wind. he'd get home faster. Spin, spin, diligent girl. Hum, whirl, good wheel. You're a naughty girl, if you don't spin. Your love won't bring you a present. She needn't be in a hurry. Her lover is not at sea. He brings no gold. but rather game. Everyone knows a hunter's worth. So long as there's no brawl, because Erik is hot-blooded; hope he does no harm! Say nothing! Or he'll be enraged and shoot his rival. Say nothing! Silence your great laughter! Do you want to make me very angry? Oh, stop this silly song! The whirling and humming hurls my ears. If you want me to listen, then find something better. Good, then you sing. Listen to my suggestion: Mary shall sing the ballad for us. God forbid! Just what I need. Leave the Flying Dutchman in peace. - How often I hear that from you. - God forbid! I can't. I'll sing it myself. Listen well, ladies. Let me speak to your hearts. The wretch's lot will move you. Yes, do go on. Mark every word. Still the spinning wheels! I'll keep spinning! With vicious wind and a storm's wrath. He once wanted to sail around a cape. He cursed and swore with great courage: In all eternity. I will never give up. Hui! And Satan heard! Hui! Took him at his word! Hui! Now, damned. he roams the sea without rest. Yet the pale man can still be delivered. If he finds a woman, who remains true to him unto death. Oh, could you. Pale sailor. Find her? Pray to heaven. That soon a woman will hold true to him. Laying anchor every seven years. To court a woman he goes ashore. Courting every seven years. He still hasn't found a faithful woman. Hui! Hoist the sails! Hui! Raise anchor! Hui! False love, false loyalty. Out to sea, no rest, no peace. Oh, where does she dwell. Whom God's angel once foresaw. Ah, where will you meet her, she who'll be true to you unto death? May I be the one to redeem you through my devotion! Let God's angel reveal me to you! Through me shall you be delivered! Shall be delivered! Heaven help us! Senta! Senta! Senta Senta! Do you wish to destroy me? Help us, Erik! She's lost her senses. I feel my blood curdling. Free me from my torment! My heart is true unto death. With my meager possessions. my hunting skills. May I ask for your hand? Won't your father reject me? If then my heart breaks in anguish, Will it be Senta. who speaks for me? If then my heart breaks in anguish, Will it be Senta. Who speaks for me? What? Do you doubt my heart? Do you doubt whether l am good to you? Oh, tell me what causes you so much pain. What clouds your mind with distrust? Your father! He only craves wealth. And Senta. how can I count on you? Have you fulfilled even one of my requests? Do you not wound my heart everyday? Your heart? What should I think? That picture... The picture? Won't you quit your infatuation? Can I help where my gaze finds sympathy? And the ballad... you sang it again today. l am but a child. and know not what I sing. Oh, say! Do you fear a song, a picture? You're so pale. Tell me, should I not fear? Should the poor man's dreadful fate not move me? My suffering, Senta, doesn't it move you anymore? Oh, don't exaggerate! How could you be suffering? Do you know that unfortunate's fate? Do you feel the pain. The deep grief with which he looks down upon me? Oh, how his peace was taken forever, sends sharp pains through my heart. Woe is me! My unhappy dream warns me. May God protect you! Satan has ensnared you! What frightens you, so? Senta, let me confide in you! It's a dream. heed its warning. I lay dreaming on high cliffs. Saw the ocean tide below and heard the surging waves. As they broke with frothing rage upon the shore. I sighted a strange ship on a nearby beach. Odd, wonderful. Two men neared land, one of whom I saw. Was your father. The other? Indeed, I recognized him. With a black vest, -his pallid features. -his dire look. The sailor, here. And I? You came from the house and flew to greet your father. But hardly did you reach him. That you fell at the feel of a stranger, and I saw you clasp his knees. He raised me up... to his breast. You clung to him with fervor. Kissed him with hot passion. And then? I saw you both flee out to sea. He's looking for me! I must see him. Appalling! - It's becoming clear to me. - With him I must perish! She's gone! My dream... spoke the truth! Oh would you. Pale sailor. Find her. Pray to heaven that soon a woman is true to him... My child. You see me at the doorstep. What? No embrace? No kiss? You stand frozen in place? Senta, do I deserve such a greeting? May God greet you. My father, tell me. who is this stranger? Are you urging me? Would you, my child. welcome this stranger? He is a sailor like me and requests our hospitality. Long without a home, always on distant voyages in foreign lands. he has gained many riches. Speak, Senta. would it annoy you if this stranger were to stay with us? Say, have I lauded her too much? You see her for yourself... ls she fit for you? Shall I go on singing her praises? Confess, she adorns her sex. If you'd like, my child. to kindly approve this man. He too wishes to accept the gracious gift of your heart. Give him your hand. as you shall call him groom. If you second your father. tomorrow he'll be your husband. Look at this band. look at these clasps. These are but a small part of what he owns. Dear child. do you not desire this? It's all yours. If you exchange rings. Yet neither speaks...? Am I in the way? That's it! It's best I leave them alone. May you win this noble man. Believe me. such luck will never come again. Believe me, she is as true as she is beautiful. As from a distant time this maiden's appearance speaks to me. As I've dreamed for all eternity. I see her here before my eyes. He stands before me. With such sorrowful features. - As I've dreamed - His unspoken grief -for all eternity. -speaks to me. Can the voice of deep sympathy deceive me? - Before my eyes. - He stands here. - I see her here. -as I've seen him before. - The dismal fervor - The pain that -that I feel burning here, - I feel in my bosom. - Shall I call it... - Ah! this longing- -love? -what shall I call it? - Oh no, it's longing -lt torments you with desire -for salvation. - What salvation it would be - How it would be -you poor man. - To share with such an angel. -to share your burden with me. Do you not despise your father's decision? What he promised. could it hold? Could you give yourself to me for all eternity? Will you give your hand to this stranger? After a life of torment, shall I find in your true love my long-sought rest? Whoever you may be and whatever ruin your cruel fate has bestowed upon you. Whatever the lot I shall acquire. I'll always be obedient to my father. What? So absolutely? Could you be filled with deep compassion for my suffering? Oh, what suffering? I could bring you comfort. What lovely sound in the turmoil of the night. You are an angel! An angel's love knows to comfort even the wretched. Oh, if I may still hope for salvation. Let it be through her! Oh, if he may still hope for salvation. Let it be only through me. If you could sense the fate that awaits you with me. You would be warned of the sacrifice that you'll make for me if you promise to be true. Shuddering, your youth would flee from the fate to which you wish to dedicate it. One calls fidelity a woman's highest virtue. But you cannot know what it means. I know very well a woman's sacred duties. Thus take comfort. Wretched man. Let fate judge who can defy its verdict. In the purity of my heart I know the sacred law of fidelity. To whomever I vow. He will I bestow with loyalty unto... death! Excuse me. My people won't wait much longer. You know. upon each return there's a feast. I'd like to embellish it. Thus I've come to see. Whether it can be combined with a betrothal. I think you've courted her to your heart's desire? Senta, my child. Are you also willing? Here is my hand and, without regret, I pledge my loyalty unto death. She gives her hand! Through her troth I defy you, Hell! To the feast! Let us all rejoice! Helmsman. leave your watch. Helmsman, come here to us. Furl the sails! Drop anchor! Helmsman, come! We fear neither wind nor crag and now we want to be merry. Each has his girl on shore. Superb tobacco and good brandy. We laugh at crag and storm outside. Furl the sails! Drop anchor! We laugh at crag and storm. Helmsman. leave your watch. Helmsman, come here to us. Helmsman, come drink with us! Crag and storm... are gone! Come and drink with us! Hey, look! They're even dancing- they've no need for girls. Girls, slop! Where are you going? Wouldn't you like some fresh wine? Your neighbors there should have some too. Are food and drink only for you? Forsooth! Take some to the poor lads! They seem weary from thirst. We can't hear them. Ah, but look! No light. No trace of the crew. Sailors! Would you like torches? Where are you then? We can't see you! Don't wake them! They're still sleeping. Hey, sailors. Answer us! Sailors, sailors! Wake up! Wake up! Sailors, sailors! Wake up! Truly, yes- they appear to be dead. They need not food or drink. You've all heard of the Flying Dutchman, his ship, how it sways, lives you see before you. Then don't wake the crew; they're ghosts. we swear upon it. How many centuries have you been at sea? Storm and crag surely do you no harm. They don't drink. They don't sing. No light burns in their ship. Have you no letters. no messages for those on land? We'll hand them to our great-grandfathers. They're old and pale, not red. And their loved ones are... dead. Sailors, tauten the sails, and show us the flight of the Flying Dutchman. They don't listen! It's horrifying here. They want nothing. So why do we call out? You girls, let the dead rest. Let the living feast! Go ahead. as the neighbors scorned it. What? Aren't you coming on board? No, not yet- it's not late. We'll come soon. Just keep drinking and, if you wish, dancing too. Now grant our tired neighbors peace. Let them rest, let them rest. Hey, there's plenty! Dear friend, have thanks. Everyone fill his glass to the brim. Dear friend, bring us drink! Neighbors! If you have voice and speech. Wake up now and join us! Wake now and join us! Helmsman. leave your watch. Helmsman, come to us. Hoist the sails! Drop anchor! Helmsman... come! Some nights we watched in awful storms and often drank the sea's salty waters. Today we watch in luxury and the girls give us better drink from the barrel. We laugh at crag and storm outside. Furl the sails! Drop anchor! We laugh at crag and storm. Helmsman. leave your watch. Helmsman, come to us. Helmsman, come drink with us. The storm is over. Come drink with us! Stormy wind, give it your best, you won't disturb our sails. Satan made our sails immune, they'll rip nevermore! What a song! ls it ghostly? How it scares me. Is it ghostly? Start to sing! Our song-sing it loud! Sing loud! Sing louder! Stormy wind, give it your best, you won't disturb our sails. Satan made our sails immune, they'll rip nevermore! What I am hearing! God, what I'm seeing! Is it delusion, or truth? Is it so? Oh, don't ask. I dare not answer. Dear God! There's no doubt, it's true! What unholy power pulled you in? What power seduced you, seduced you so quickly. Only to break this truest of hearts? Your father, ha! He brought the groom here. I know him. I can imagine what happened. Bu! you... is it possible? You gave your hand to a man. Who'd hardly crossed your threshold. I must not see you again or think about you anymore. My great duty demands it. What great duty? Is it not more honorable to keep what you once pledged me: to be forever true? What? I pledged you eternal loyalty? Senta! Oh, Senta! Do you deny it? Won't you recall the day you called me to you in the valley? When, to pluck you mountain flowers. I carried countless burdens? What coursed through me as our hands touched- tell me. was it not the assurance that you would be true? Yes, your promise to be true? Lost! Ah, lost! Deliverance forever lost! What do I see, God? Senta, farewell! Stop, wretched man! What are you taking on? Into the sea... into the sea for eternity! I'm done with loyalty. Your faith and my salvation! Farewell! I do not wish to bring you ruin. Terrible, that look. Slop! From here you were never to flee. Hoist the sails! Raise anchor! Unfortunate woman- know the fate that all incur. Who break their loyal oath: Eternal damnation is their lot. Through me. countless have fallen victim to this sentence. But you shall be saved! Farewell! Sail away. My salvation, into eternity. Help! Save, save her! I know you very well. I well know your fate. I recognized you at first sight. The end of your torment has arrived! It is I, through whose faith you shall find your salvation. Help her! She is lost! What do I see? God help! You don't know me. You have no idea who I am. Ask the seas in all directions. Ask the sailor, who's crossed the ocean. He knows this ship. The dread of all the pious. They call me the Flying Dutchman! Senta! Senta! What will you do? Praise your angel and his bidding. Here I stand. True to you unto death!
