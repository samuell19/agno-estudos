How about my usual? Okay. Did you have a good Thanksgiving? It was busy. I had a nice dinner with my dad, covered the Turkey Trot Marathon and covered the bus driver strike. Always on the go, nonstop. You are a chip off the old block. Well, it's the only way I'm gonna make editor one day. How about editor-in-chief? Even better. - Promise me one thing. - What? Will you take some time off for Christmas? My dad's going on a cruise with some friends, so I was thinking of covering this year's consumer trends. - If you say so. - Mm-hmm. You know, with all this Christmas stuff around, you kinda look like, uh... Don't say it. [chuckles] Bye. - So? - So? The guy I was telling you about, my cousin's roommate's brother, he was supposed to call you on Thanksgiving. - He did. - And? And I'll tell you the same thing I told him. I don't have time to start dating again. You know, you have to have more going on in your life than just reporting other people's news. Ever since you and Luke broke up, this promotion is all you ever think about. Who's Florence talking to? I don't know, but I wouldn't worry about it. Everybody knows that you're a shoo-in for news editor position. That's Melanie Dower. - Uh... - CEO of Dower Media? One of the biggest digital media conglomerates of the west coast. What would someone like that want with our paper? Can you imagine if she bought the Chronicle? Think of all the stories we could report on. I'm talking Pulitzer categories. Aren't all her papers digital, though? Yeah, but it's a whole new world. At least this way, we won't go under anytime soon. Jackie, Kat, conference room, 10 minutes! Here it comes. As most of you are aware, there's been a steady decline in our paper's circulation. Fact is, in this day and age, people would rather watch their news on a screen, which is why I just made a deal with Melanie Dower for our very own Sunshine Chronicle to join her Dower Media digital news empire. Thank you. Thanks to your hard work, this paper-- your paper-- has become a trusted name in news, and will now continue for many years under our Dower Media umbrella. Um, hi. Sorry. Jackie Evans. What does this mean in terms of the current news editor opening? Inevitably, there will need to be some changes made, but over the next few days, I'll be meeting with each and every one of you to find where you best fit. [applause] You mean if we fit. Uh, Florence, wait. Don't worry. I told Melanie that you are my top choice for news editor. That's, uh... That's not what I was-- Okay, yeah. That's what I was gonna ask. You are a great journalist, Jackie. - I'm sure she's gonna see that. - Thank you. But being a good editor is about more than just recognizing a good story. Yeah, totally. I get that. Mm-hmm. I once reported on this dive team that discovered this new species of coral right here off the coast. That article went on to win awards, got me my first promotion. But what I had to learn first was what it was like to breathe 30 feet under the surface. Do you understand what I'm trying to say? Yeah. It's one thing to report about something, and it's quite another to live it. Never forget that. Okay. Did I hear they're gonna close the newspaper? Oh, actually, it's being acquired. Well, I suppose if things don't work out, you can always try this. What is it? There's a small town newspaper up for sale in Lantern Grove, Alaska. I can't afford to buy a newspaper. You wouldn't have to. They're giving it away for free. Free? Yeah. All you have to do is keep it running. I am not moving to the middle of Nowhere, Alaska, to write about deer crossing. I know, I know. You're a big-city journalist. Why do you have a Juneau Weekly? I used to live up there. Oh, you used to live near the North Pole? Thanks anyway. Why don't you hang on to that? Packing material for when you move into that corner office. [chuckles] Free newspaper. Nice. - Very nice. - Thanks. You're a good writer, Jacqueline. Jackie. Oh, everyone just calls me Jackie. Florence said you were being considered for the news editor position. Yes. It's been a lifelong dream of mine to run a newsroom, and promotion to news editor is the first step. Unfortunately, with the size and stature of our company, I'll be needing someone with more... experience. Oh, but Florence said-- Jacqueline, I have no doubt you're a talented journalist, but being a supervisor requires someone with a whole different skill set. Would you consider staying on as a staff reporter? That was my title five years ago. And who knows? In a few years, we may have something for you. [scoffs] I took the staff job. Oh, well, maybe I should have accepted it too. It's just-- I worked so hard for that promotion. I know. It feels wrong to start all over. And I know I have what it takes. Any clue what you're gonna do now? Do you think I did the wrong thing, quitting like that? I think you've worked very hard to get where you are, and you've never been a hamster on a wheel. What does that mean? Running fast in the same place, not going anywhere. Then I'm not crazy for considering this? Do you remember that ski trip we took up there when you were eight? Vaguely. You got snow in your jacket and cried for hours. Dad, I'm being serious. Then seriously, I think you need to see what it's all about. Some of my best years were from when I worked for the Berkshire Gazette in Nowheresville, Indiana, and look where I ended up. Your lifetime achievement award. You always find a way to insert that into our conversations. Worked my whole life for it. Gotta show it off. But look what happened to the Sunshine Chronicle. I mean, print is on the decline. Would this really be a step in the right direction? Local news is the heart of our country, no matter how it's reported. And "editor-in-chief" will look great on your resume, no matter what. No one's saying you have to live in Alaska forever. Just go get the experience. You have nothing to lose, except your fingers. - What? - Frostbite. - It's cold up there. - [laughs] Okay. P.A. ANNOUNCER: Passengers on Flight 14 to Tonsina and Valdez please line up at gate two. "Looking forward to meeting up. I'll be the one in the hat with the flaps." Great. Uh, Finn Thompson? No? - No, not me. - Right. Sorry! - Uh, Finn Thompson? - Uh-uh. Sorry. Ugh! Everyone has flaps. - [clears throat] - Oh! Finn Thompson? I didn't realize there was a person underneath all that. Well, I like to be prepared. Evidently. Hey, listen, sorry I'm a little late. Traffic was a little backed up, uh, for an elk herd. Hope you weren't waiting too long. What do you say we jump in, I'll blast the heat? Okay. So nice of you. ♪ So are you a newspaper or a glassblowing company? No, the newspaper was my father's. After he passed, I was tasked with finding someone to take it over, and, well, here you are. So why not just do it yourself? I guess you could say I never really had the, uh... intuitive journalist gene. Ha! So you really never worked for your dad? I had a paper route. - Okay. - Here's what I don't get. You spent the last 15 years working for the Sunshine Chronicle. Yes. Why Lantern Grove? Well, as it happens, the Sunshine Chronicle was recently purchased by a large digital media conglomerate. You got fired. No. They just didn't recognize everything I had to contribute. You quit. I just figured that the best way to prove them wrong would be to run my own newspaper. I do get to be editor-in-chief, right? Sure! Okay. Huh. You folks really like Christmas around here. This close to the North Pole, how could you not? My parents usually worked every Christmas, so I never really saw it as that big a deal. Well, get ready to find out just how big a deal it really is. Ugh. Wait. This this can't be it. Allow me to present the Lantern Grove Press. Okay, but what happened to a proud institution forged in the great journalistic tradition? Nah. No one really reads it around here anymore. At least not since it went down to just doing one issue a month. Coming? [exhales] Yeah. FINN: Knock knock! EDNA: Finn, is that you? Come on over and say hello to your new editor-in-chief. Edna, this is Jackie Evans. Pleasure to meet you. Welcome to Lantern Grove, Alaska. Thank you. Edna here runs our printing press and rents the apartment upstairs. Daniel was a good man. It's been hard with him gone, but it'll be nice having a boss again. Thank you. - You're here! - Hey! - Hi! - Hi. Ooh, hi! Dolores here is our newspaper's photographer. Daniel took one look at her work and knew she would be perfect. Really? And what work is that? I took all the menu photos for my husband's diner. Best gingerbread in the whole county. Well, I look forward to working with the both of you. So we have a photographer and... - Head of operations. - Yes. Okay. Where's the rest of the staff? Well, uh... Edna and Dolores are pretty much, uh, it, in that they are it. So two people for the entire newspaper. I'm no writer, but along with some of my photographs, we've included the latest weather reports. - And traffic. - Yes, and fishing conditions. Always. So that's what you've been printing? Uh-huh. Well, with Daniel gone, there's been no real direction. Yeah. Until now. And here you are, our saving grace. Well, first thing, we need to hire a full staff, and then maybe get some new computers. None those things are in the budget. Well, what's the budget? Oh. Oh, oh, okay. It's okay, it's okay because once we start printing issues and things pick up, it'll be the first thing on the list. Well, we've already printed the December issue. Well, fire up the presses, ladies, because we are going daily again. Well, you just tell me what you want me to print, and I'll print it. Great. Now, do you have a place to stay? I can always share the upstairs apartment. Oh, that is very kind of you, but I just rented a place right outside of town. Well, should we hit the road and get you settled? Great, thanks. Um, Edna, Dolores, I will see the two of you first thing in the morning, okay? - Okay. - We'll be ready to work. - Bye. - Bye. Ah! [laughs] Huh. It's secluded. Now, the town butcher used to live here, so there's like a weird stench. Just open some windows. I'm kidding. Hey, so, uh... you need any help getting settled? It's a rental, so the heat probably hasn't been on. Well, I know how to run a thermostat. It's a wood-burning stove. - Funny. - Not kidding. Well, I'm sure I know how to light some wood on fire. Why do I get the feeling you're trying to get rid of me? Maybe you have the intuitive journalist gene after all [laughing] Okay. Huh. [shivering] Ooh. Huh. Heat. Heat, heat, heat, heat. Huh. No wood. Great. I'm gonna bundle. I'm just gonna bundle up. I'm gonna bundle up. [groaning] Bundle up. ♪ Oh, you must be Jackie Evans. I'm Dolores' husband, Teddy. Oh, nice to meet you. I hear you have a good coffee, and I am desperately in need of coffee. Oh, we have good everything. Wanna make it a gingerbread latte? A gingerbread-- A gingerbread latte? Oh! Ooh! Gingerbread is our seasonal specialty. You got gingerbread pie, gingerbread soufflé, gingerbread pudding, gingerbread muffins, gingerbread bread. Okay! Gingerbread... A gingerbread latte sounds delicious. - Well... - Thank you. Have a seat, and we'll have that right out. - Ooh! - Hi, Mayor. I'll get my usual to-go today. Lots to get done for the Christmas tree decorating. Bacon and eggs to-go, coming up. Oh, Mayor, this is Jackie, the new editor-in-chief of the Lantern Grove Press. - Hi. - You don't say. Well, that's wonderful news. Daniel Thompson was a good friend of mine - and a very lovely man - Oh. That paper meant a lot to him. Glad someone is showing an interest in it. That wouldn't happen to be a dig towards me there, would it? No, of course not, Finn. I'm happy that someone wanted to take a chance on it. - Oh, but I must tell you-- - Let me guess. The people around here don't read the newspaper. Oh, good. You already know. Well, I hope to change all of that. It only takes a few good articles to spark some interest. I'm sure the people of Lantern Grove are interested in... something. ALL: Christmas. Oh, of course. She doesn't like Christmas. I-I didn't say that, exactly. This close to the North Pole, how can you not? What I meant was-- What kind of news interests people here? Oh, I think... good news. Okay, well, I better go and figure all that out. Thank you for the latte. Pleasure. Huh. They sure do love Christmas. Of course, when you're this close to the North Pole. [laughs] So I've heard. Finn's father used to throw a massive Christmas party every year right here. Well, what happened? He got sick. Wasn't really the same after that. Oh. But there. That's every issue for the last 10 years. Whoa! You got your standard small-town stuff. You know, store coupons, good recipes, town elections. Here's a good article on our mayor. You know what? I think I just met him at the diner. Does he always dress in three-piece suits? Owns hats in every color. William's a snazzy dresser. - Always has been. - Oh! - They go back. - Uh-huh. We went to high school together. Prom date. Then he married someone else, and I got busy doing other things. Oh, I didn't see a ring. Because he's divorced now. Isn't that right, Edna? It's never too late, Edna. Can we get back to the paper? - Okay. - So... were you serious about going daily? Of course. I mean, news happens every day, right? So first things first, we should publish a short issue as soon as possible, announcing our return to the town. - Love it. - And then we should reach out to our subscriber base and let them know what we're up to. Is there a list? Mm. All of our records were done by hand. Huh. Okay. Huh. I don't suppose either of you have a key. Oh, Finn might. Hmm. Of course. I'll go get it. You two stay here and start brainstorming ideas for our "we're back and better than ever" edition. Aye-aye, Captain. - Hello. - Uhh... Almost done. Oh, it's stunning. Thanks. It's part of the Christmas ornament series I'm doing for the town Christmas tree decorating. Of course you are. Come on, I'll show you. Every year, we put up a tree at the old firehouse and then folks come, and they put up their own decorations. Welcome. When you said you made glass, I thought you meant like mirrors and windows. Oh, sure, I could do that too, I suppose, if you really wanted me to. Do you sell these? Some. Online, mostly. Oh. So this is what you did instead of following in your dad's footsteps? Yeah. He thought it was just a hobby, something I'd outgrow. But, boy, was he crushed when I told him I didn't want to grow up to be a newspaperman. Funny. All I've ever wanted to do was run a newsroom. - Really? - Yeah. Like since you were a kid? Yeah. Before my dad retired, he was the editor-in-chief of the San Francisco Star. [whistles] Yeah. My mom was a journalist too. That's how they met. I spent most of my childhood in a newsroom. I loved the energy of it all. So basically the complete opposite of me. Mm... So I'm guessing you didn't come by to admire my art. Oh, um, right. Do you have the key to your dad's files? I need a list of all your past subscribers. Thank you. Actually, though, you should come to the firehouse tomorrow night, see what we're all about here at Lantern Grove. You know what? That would be a great place to hand out the first issue. Or you can just come and enjoy it for yourself. Okay. You sound like my friend Kat. Business comes first. But thank you. [door opens] [door closes] Okay. I'm about to... Oh, no, no, no, no. We don't need my picture in the paper. Are you kidding? The readers would love to get to know you. Yeah, but this issue is supposed to be about our reintroduction into the community. You have to write a little about yourself too. - You're the big news. - Mm-hmm. Let the town meet the new editor-in-chief. You think I should? Oh, totally. It's a small town. People like a personal touch. Yeah, but the best journalists always say keep yourself out of the story. Just a quick intro, not your autobiography. [laughs] And see? You look great in this picture. Okay, well, you do have a good eye. Oh, thanks. Okay, fine. I'll mention myself on the last page, if you think it'll generate more interest. Thank you. You're welcome. ♪ ♪ Hi. Would you like an issue of the Lantern Grove Press? We are relaunching under new management. - Excuse me, would you-- - No, thanks. Should have put your picture on the front, not the back. I think they're just not interested in a newspaper. Oh! I got it. No, no. Sorry, sir. That's not what that is for. - At least he took one. - Yeah, ha ha. Something to cheer you up? Try it. It's Teddy's secret gingerbread recipe. Your husband loves gingerbread. It's the flavor of the season. Wow. Every year, my grandmother used to make gingerbread ornaments for the tree. And she'd always donate the extra dough to anyone who couldn't afford Christmas cookies. That's so sweet. You guys do this every year? TEDDY: Yeah, for the last 60 years. Oh, that's incredible. So all these ornaments have individual significance? Most of them, yeah. That's what makes our town tree so special. Yeah. FINN: What? I just got a great idea for a story.

Did you know that the Ronsons always knit their ornaments in memory of their aunt? Or that Patrick Brewer's ornaments are from his childhood pen pal, who lives in Vietnam? I did not know that. I was thinking. Since this town loves Christmas so much, why not kick off the first issue writing about something they care about? What about your ornament? My ornament? I don't-- I don't have one. You can't come to the Lantern Grove tree decorating and not put up an ornament of your own. Okay. Now you do. And I think I see the perfect spot. Uh, I better get going.

Let's see how many you can do. [scoffs] It's just a story. - Ah-ah-ah. - I was just-- Well, I guess we're gonna be wrapping some gifts. ♪ [click] Hi, Finn. Uh-oh. Delores with her camera, always. [camera phone clicking] Uh-oh. Let me guess. Phone died again. No. I just kinda took a liking to it. You know, my dad used to go on and on about how it was superior to any technology. I kinda see what he meant. My dad used to keep his right here in his front pocket. So what do you do here? I am in charge of sorting the toys into age groups, which basically means I get to try some of them out. - Is that so? - It's so. - For instance, this ball here? - Yeah. Now, I, okay, have to bounce it to know how high it goes in order to know if it is safe for small children. That is very scientific. - I know. - Mm-hmm. - Matter of fact... - What? You try. No, no, uh-uh. No, no, no, no. I'm not-- If you can throw this Frisbee, then we know a six-year-old could too. - Nice. - Try. No, I'm reporting. I'm not participating. Journalism is objective. Oh! Christmas is subjective, and these kids deserve to know if they're getting good toys or not. Hmm... Fine. I'll go long. Okay. [clears throat] Ooh! Oh! [laughs] I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! Look what you made me do! Yeah, but now we know it's not safe for small children. Okay. [chuckles] Perfect. [camera phone clicks] [click] Um, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna get back to reporting. And I'm gonna get back to, uh, sorting. JACKIE: Looking at all the presents, one can only imagine the smiles and wide-eyed excitement of the children who get to open up these toys on Christmas morning. For the volunteers at the toy drive, it's the thought of making a kid's Christmas that much brighter that warms the heart. So whether it's a handful of clay or the throw of a Frisbee, thanks to the community of Lantern Grove... Christmas just got a little more fun for everyone. ♪ - Hey, how are you? - How are you? Are you getting one too? [laughs] I mean, it went flying. I'm just glad it didn't hit the guy in the head. Sounds like you and Finn had fun. Oh, yeah. Almost getting kicked out of the toy drive, a lot of fun. I don't know. You're smiling a lot more than when I first met you. I'm just glad there's a line outside. What? I think Finn is very handsome. - If I were 30 years younger... - Edna! I'm just saying. Look, I don't understand him. It's like every time I feel like we're connecting, - he just shuts down. - To be continued. Hey, Finn. Am I crazy, or are people lined up for the paper? Well, get used to it because there are a lot more Christmas activities to cover. I'm gonna get some more string. Well, does that mean you're coming to my ice sculpting? Your what, now? Every year I sculpt ice for charity. All the money that we raise from the auction goes to provide meals for the homeless. Now, that sounds like a front page story. You know what sounds like an even better story? What? Helping me. - She'd love to. - Edna! - Great. It's settled then. - No, no. Besides not knowing the first thing about ice sculpting, I told you. You told me. You're reporting, not participating. - Exactly. - Except my dad always told me the best stories are the ones that are personal to the writer. Yeah, well, you're the artistic one, not me. Yeah, but you are logical and hard-working, and I think we can make a pretty unstoppable team. What do you say? - [sighs] - Yes, yes. I-I say... I say you're nuts. And I say if you... are gonna keep writing about Christmas in this town, then you need to experience Christmas in this town. - I guess it couldn't hurt. - Good.

JACKIE: Mrs. Adams, one of the oldest citizens of Lantern Grove, recalled one special Christmas memory from many years ago. A young man named Tom would come to her window and serenade her with a different carol every night, leading up to Christmas. On the last night, as he sang the chorus to "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing," he got down on one knee and gave her a ring. ♪ Hark! The herald angels sing ♪ Glory to the newborn king ♪ ♪ Peace on Earth and mercy mild ♪ ♪ God and sinners reconciled ♪ [door closes] - ♪ Joyful all-- - [clears throat] [gasps] Got a beautiful voice.

You know, when I was a kid, my dad would bring me up here all the time, and I'd stare through the telescope, and he'd tell me all about the constellations and the planets. At least for a little while, all our differences would be just put aside. Dads are the best. Yeah. I was always worried I was gonna let him down, but... not anymore. Thanks to you. Okay, what am I seeing? What is this? Let's see. That... is Ursa Major. Is it? The great bear. Native to Alaska. The Inuit actually called it "tukturjuit." The caribou. Okay. Reindeer? Hey, I told you Christmas is a big deal around here. Anyway, in the fall, when the caribou would rise up on its hind legs, that's when the Inuit would know that midnight was approaching. Really? That's how the ice hunters knew that they could find their way back to land. Alaska's a pretty magical place. Yeah. So I'm learning. - Wanna see something cool? - Mm-hmm.

Edna here runs our printing press, and we have a great photographer. You got this. Is it true you became editor-in-chief after seeing an ad in another paper? Yes. The son of the previous owner had been looking for someone to run the place, and of course, when I got here, I realized there wasn't much of a paper left. How did you turn things around so quickly? Christmas editions. People want to read about news they care about, and I discovered that people in this town care very much about Christmas. Here in Lantern Grove, Christmas isn't just about gifts and cookies. It's about people coming together to create memories and show support for one another. I mean, the whole town is like one big happy family. So what will happen to the paper after Christmas is over? What do you mean? Do you have plans for the rest of the year? Um, well, you're just gonna have to wait and see. Well, folks, while many newspapers around the country have been moving online, the Lantern Grove Press has started to thrive again, thanks to one woman and the vibrant community of this small Alaskan town. - Thanks. - Yeah. Very cool what you've done here. Thanks. Um, hey, excuse me. - Can I ask you something? - Sure. Who runs Buzz News? - We're a subset of Dower Media. - Of course you are. They pretty much own everything these days. I'm sure it won't be long till they wanna buy this place. Thanks. [sighs] We have tripled our numbers. I've got subscription requests from Winter Pines. That's 20 miles away. And look at the stack of resumes we got from people applying to work here. That's good news, Jackie. What? Oh, yeah. It's fantastic. Then why does your face say otherwise? She's right. What's gonna happen to our paper after Christmas? I mean, what if people lose interest? They won't, not as long as we keep giving the community what they like to read. I just wish there was a way to keep their attention. Something that could bring the whole town together. Something they all enjoy. A symbol of what this paper means to the community. A way to take our success and keep it year-round. Are you saying what I think you're saying? I mean, when you're this close to the North Pole, why not? We're gonna need a lot of tinsel. Fresh-baked gingerbread cream puffs! Oh, you magician! And you seem to be in a really good mood. What are you talking about? It's usual mood. Dolores said she saw you and Jackie driving down Main Street together the other night. Fine. Yeah, I like her. See? That wasn't so hard. Yeah, but admitting it is not the hard part. Telling her is? What if she doesn't feel the same way? What if something better comes along for her? Then give her a reason to stay. Cream puffs? No. Telling her how you feel. But yeah, those will get the ball rolling. [sighs] You're a genius. [door opens] [door closes] Left one. Other left. Santa. [laughs] Thanks. Hey, I, uh... brought you cream puffs. - Ooh. - Gingerbread. - Teddy? - Yeah. I wanted to talk to you about something. Mmm. These are so good. Do you think we can get some for the party? What party? Ah. I've decided it's been too long since Lantern Grove Press has had their annual Christmas party, so... this year, we're bringing it back. You're gonna throw a Christmas party? This close to the North Pole, how could I not? That's okay, right? My dad lived for those parties. When? The 23rd. Christmas-Eve Eve. - Mm-hmm. - Love that. So you approve. - On one condition. - Hmm? You let me... help you decorate. Deal. So what'd you want to talk to me about? - Hmm? - Just now. You said there was something you wanted to talk to me about. Did not. I did? Forgot. Okay. Well, if you remember, let me know. KELLY: Is it true you became editor-in-chief after seeing another ad in another paper? JACKIE: Yes. The son of the previous owner had been looking for someone to run the place. Of course, when I got here, I realized there wasn't much of a paper left. KELLY: This is only your 12th issue. How did you turn things around so quickly? Oh, Christmas editions. People want to read about news they care about, and I discovered that the people here care a great deal about Christmas. Here in Lantern Grove, Christmas isn't about gifts and cookies. It's about coming together to create memories and showing support for one another. The whole town is like, I don't know, one big happy family. Jacqueline. Hmm. Brianna, get me the numbers for a paper called... the Lantern Grove Press. Think there's too much? Um, how much garland is too much garland? This much garland? [laughs] It's fine. What are you working on? It's a new weekly feature I came up with. It's a spotlight on local businesses. I thought we could start with a business that specializes in Christmas items, but also sells other items throughout the year. Oh, you mean like maybe the town glassblower. Okay, fine. I was thinking Finn would be a great business to kick things off. His work is stunning. I just don't think a lot of people know what it all entails. So it has nothing to do with the fact that you're falling in love with him? Oh, Dolores, I'm a journalist. I'm impartial. Then pretend I'm asking my friend Jackie and not journalist Jackie. I... Yes. I knew it! I could've told you from the moment you got here. I didn't even like him then! And what is your excuse now? I don't know. It's like he's still afraid to get involved, like he thinks he's gonna jinx the paper or something. Well, the only way to find out for sure is to tell him how you feel. Yeah, well, first, I'm going to see how he does his craft and then write a great article. And then you're gonna tell him. Mm-hmm. I'll think about it. FINN: Come in! That is incredible. Thank you. Thought I'd experiment with some different colors, and I'm still finessing the details, but I thought it kind of reminded me of... The Northern Lights. Yeah, exactly. So what are you gonna do with all these, sell them? Actually, no. Um... I made them for the party. Your party. The big paper's party. I thought you could hang them on a tree or put them up in the office or... Thank you. Thank you. Means a lot, what you're doing. I'm sure he'd be proud. Yeah. Of many things. So what do I owe this drop-in to? Oh, I was thinking of starting a feature on local businesses, and, well, I thought you should be the first one. Did you? Yeah. I mean, if you're up for it. - Well, that depends. - On what? Well, I think if you're going to properly convey my techniques, then you need to try it for yourself. You want me to what? Safety is our first priority. Okay. All right. Careful. Careful. Oh, so it's hot. Yeah, it's about 2,500 degrees. - So what you're gonna do... - Okay. - You take this. - All right. - Just like that. - Mm-hmm. Oh, God. You're gonna dip it down in the flame. - Just like that. - Yeah. And you're gonna roll it. - Am I doing this right? - Yeah. All right. This just helps to distribute the heat evenly. Yeah? And then once you start to see that the glass is starting to soften... - You see that? - Yeah. Then you can take that and put it into the crushed glass. That's perfect. And then you go back into the heat. Mm-hmm. You roll it, and now you're ready for the best part. Now we just blow? - Yeah, you blow and roll. - Okay. - Like this. - Mm-hmm. Just even breaths. Every like 10 to 15 seconds apart. [blowing] Now it goes in the annealing oven, which is only 1,050 degrees. And then we let it cool down over the next 14 hours. Oh, I'm sorry. 14 hours? Yeah. This way it doesn't crack while it hardens. It's a slow process. So sort of the exact opposite of working at a newspaper. Probably why my dad and I were opposites. He liked the constant go. I like the constant slow. Hmm. So I've noticed. I know you were close, and I just need you to know. I won't let either of you down. [phone buzzing] Sorry. I don't-- I don't know this number. Sorry. We should go to the party together. Together? As in a date? Yeah, like a date. Okay, yeah. That sounds great. JACKIE: Watching the glass take shape was like watching magic. I had to remind myself that it was just physics and chemistry. Definitely a lot of chemistry. But the way the glass moved and the colors blended with only the slightest guidance, it was otherworldly. [phone ringing] Hello. Jacqueline, finally we connect. I've been trying to reach you. I'm sorry. Who is this? Melanie Dower. I just touched down in Juneau, and I'm heading your way. Why? I want to buy... the Lantern Grove Press. I underestimated you. What you've done here is nothing short of a miracle. A paper that was basically dead is now profitable again. Thank you. I appreciate you saying that. When I saw your interview on our Buzz News site, I knew I had made a mistake, Jacqueline. Uh, it's... Jackie. Jackie. Let me make it up to you. I want to buy the Lantern Grove Press, which in turn will free you up to come back to the Sunshine Chronicle as editor-in-chief. Oh. That's my dream job. So that's a yes? Uh, technically the paper still belongs to the Thompson family. It's not mine to sell. Then I'll call him. I'm sure we can make a deal. Okay, assuming all that happens, who's gonna oversee things here? No one. It will just become an outlet for our regularly syndicated news, which is a win-win. As part of Dower Media, the Lantern Grove Press will be available for its readers for many years to come, across the country. [chuckles] Just not in print. You know we're a strictly digital company. Yeah, yeah. Um, can I think about it? Sure, but I fly out tomorrow. I need to know then. Christmas Eve? Is it? Oh. I'm so busy. Hard to remember. How do I find this Finn fellow? Um, uh, actually, would it be okay if I talk to him first? Of course. I'm staying at the B&B on Main. Just let me know. Okay. [door opens] [door closes] Hot off the presses! Not so bad, if I don't say so myself. Jackie? What would you do... if someone offered you your dream job, but it meant leaving Lantern Grove? Well, that wouldn't be my dream job. Exactly. Lantern Grove has everything I could ever need. What's wrong? Dower Media wants to buy Lantern Grove Press. Wait, what? So what would happen to you? I'd go back to the Sunshine Chronicle as editor-in-chief. [sighs] - That's a lot to process. - Mm-hmm. It would also mean that Lantern Grove Press would be an online newspaper. You are... talented and hardworking. You deserve to go as far as you can in your career. It's the job I always wanted. Then you have to take it. Mm-hmm. But the idea of of leaving both of you and Finn, I-- We know, we know. We know. It's Santa hat day. Won't be served without a Santa hat. Hey, Finn, I need to talk to you. Which one should I wear to the party tonight? Oh, no, it's not-- It's not about that. Jackie, I hope you'll be joining us for Christmas Eve dinner. Oh, I make the best roasted potatoes. Hey, can we take a walk? - Yeah. - Yeah, okay. So? Dower Media Group wants to buy Lantern Grove Press. Well, that's great news, isn't it? That ensures my father's legacy. He'd be thrilled. Yeah. It wouldn't be printed. It'd be online. Okay, but you'd still be running the paper, wouldn't you? I won't sell unless you're running it. [sighs] You would still be in charge, wouldn't you? I've been offered the editor-in-chief back in San Diego. Wow. The job you originally wanted. Better than the job I wanted. What'd you tell her? That the paper isn't mine to sell. That she'd have to talk to you, but I wanted to tell you first. No, I meant what'd you tell her about taking the job? That I'd think about it. Do you want it? I do, but it's not-- It's not that easy. When do you get to decide by? Soon. Tomorrow. Tomorrow? Well, I guess we better make tonight count, right? Still pick you up for the party? Yeah, yeah. I mean, if you still want to. Yeah, of course. A date's a date Okay. MR. EVANS: This job was just to help give you experience, boost your resume. - And it did that, right? - Yeah. You were so successful with the Christmas edition that now the bigwigs are calling. That was the plan, but I guess I didn't account for... - Mr. Handsome Glassblower guy? -Okay. Amongst other things. It's weird, but when Melanie first offered me the job, the only thing I could think of was... missing the smell of fresh ink from the printing press. Random, I know. Sometimes it's the little things that add up to what we love. Every time I was offered a position at a bigger paper, I had to decide what mattered most to me. And what was that? You and your mom. I knew I'd be working an insane amount of hours and barely get to see you guys. Just wasn't for me. But you're a free bird. An independent spirit. The little girl that played pretend New York Times newsroom. Okay. Oh! I have to go. Finn will be here in a bit, and I have to get ready. Have a fun date. And, Jackie, whatever you decide, I'm here for you. ♪ JACKIE: It's open. Wow. I, uh... love what you've done with the place. Well, when you're this close to the North Pole... Wow. Stop it. No. I mean... You look stunning. Are those for me? Yes. Those are for you. And those are, um... - snapdragons. - Oh! Which is actually one of the only flowers that grows in the wintertime here in Alaska. Wow. What are some of the other ones? No idea. That's just what Gilda at the flower place said. Listen, about the job... No, no, mm-mm, no. Not tonight. - Okay? - Yeah. Tonight we're going to a party. Okay. Um, you just put these in water? ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la La la la la ♪ ♪ 'Tis the season to be jolly ♪ Fa la la la la La la la la ♪ ♪ Don we now our gay apparel Hey! - Mayor. - Great to see you. Merry Christmas. How are you? Well, mighty fine party you two pulled together. Oh, this is all Jackie and Finn. Give yourself some credit too. I know how hard you work. Have you seen the updates on our new printing press? Oh, no. I'd love to see. Follow me. Ooh! You throw a nice party. I only hope we live up to your father's legacy. This... is much better. You sound so certain. I am 'cause you're here. Finn, listen. No. No. Jackie? Melanie, I didn't expect to see you here. Well, I heard this is the place to be. And you know me. I like to have my finger on the pulse. Well, I'm glad you're here. This is Finn Thompson. Finn, it's a pleasure to meet you. This is Melanie Dower. Dower Media. And hopefully the future owner of the Lantern Grove Press. Well, whatever Jackie decides, I'll go with. Well, that's great news. We don't need to talk shop right now. I just wanted to experience this lovely little town for myself. And right now I see there's some homemade gingerbread that needs experiencing right over there. Excuse me. Well, so much for not talking about it tonight. Are you serious, that it's up to me to sell? Yeah, of course. But if you left... who would run the place? I'm sure I'm not the only one that can run this place. No one would do as good a job as you. [tapping on glass] WOMAN: Jackie, speech! MAN: Jackie, speech! Speech, speech! No one. Um, I didn't... I didn't prepare anything for tonight, but I want to say a few words about all of you and this wonderful paper. My father once told me that I have, and I quote, "never been a hamster on a wheel." apparently that I've been incapable of staying in one place for too long. If you'd have asked me a couple of months ago where I saw my future, I would have told you... news editor of the Sunshine Chroniclein San Diego, where today it was a wintry 66 degrees. [laughter] But something happened. And thanks to a little article in Juneau Weekly, I found a little newspaper in a little town looking for someone to run it. I'll admit I, uh... I really just needed a job, but what I got was a family. And thanks to all of you, an adventure. Alaska is a magical place. Thank you, all of you, for sharing it with me. Merry Christmas. ALL: Merry Christmas! Hi, guys! Can I get a picture? Perfect. Perfect. You're doing great, okay? What a great party. Wow. She is something. Yes, she is. That was amazing. Thank you. Jackie, take the job. Do you really mean that? I have this feeling that... It's like this overwhelming sense of just wanting you to be happy. Yeah. I have that same feeling for you. Go on. Tell her. Hey, you need a hand? No. Not much to pack. Mm-hmm. I got this for you as a thank you for everything. I love it! [laughs] Oh, you do look good in that hat. - Thank you. - Uh-huh. I know you've only been here a month, but... it seems like I've known you a lifetime. Yeah, I know what you mean. Do you, um... Do you think I'm doing the right thing? Maybe there isn't always a right thing. I think there's always a best thing, and that's different for people, depending upon what they want. Hmm. And that... is a clever way of not answering my question. [laughs] That's 'cause I can't answer it. My best thing is different from yours. Mm. And your best thing would be finally asking William out on a date. In due time. There is no rush. Yeah. Not here in Lantern Grove. I sent you the latest issue of the Christmas edition, and I guess my last. I know you're gonna be headed out soon, but I think this issue deserves a letter from the editor. Hmm. I'll see what I can do. Jackie! - I'm gonna miss you so much. - I know. I'm gonna miss you too. Keep taking pictures, yeah? I promised Melanie you'd keep 'em coming. Of course. But it's not gonna be the same without you. Yeah, I know. Listen, have you seen Finn? I actually leave tonight on Melanie's plane. No one's talked to him since last night. Jackie! I'm glad you're here. Great news. I've had so many businesses asking if you can feature them in the Lantern Grove Press, some even asking for ad space. William, you haven't heard? Jackie won't be running the paper anymore. - What's that now? - It'll still exist. Just as a syndicate to Dower News Media. Oh. What about Edna? She'll shall stay on as community liaison to Dower. Oh. I better get going. I am so sorry that I'm gonna miss Christmas Eve dinner. - Me too. - Yeah. Come here. JACKIE: I always thought being a good journalist meant keeping an outside perspective. My entire adult life, that's what I did. I observed other people, other places and other things. Christmas to me was no different. Just another subject to report on. I've written articles about Christmas parades, Christmas charity balls, Christmas consumerism, but I never experienced a true Christmas until I came to Lantern Grove. The beauty of this place is you can't just be a bystander. You have to be a part of it. This community embraced me and allowed me to live inside the narrative for the first time in my life. And let me tell you, it has been more wonderful than I could have ever imagined. People want to read about things they care about and can only do so if it's clear the writer cares as well. Let me tell you, Lantern Grove, I care. I care about your traditions, your ornaments, your memories, your kindness and your talents. But most of all, I care about all the people that encompass this place. As I bid farewell, I take with me the notion that it's never enough just to report on life, but it's imperative to experience it, to hold in your hand just like this newspaper. Christmas may come just once a year, but I've learned here in Lantern Grove that it's a feeling that I never want to live without. [ding] Hmm. Okay. Are you ready? Well, you travel light. What, no bags? Uh, Melanie? I'm so sorry, but I've changed my mind. What? I don't want to leave Lantern Grove. I want to stay here and print newspapers as editor-in-chief as long as I can. So you don't want the job with us. I'm so grateful and flattered, but everything I ever wanted and never even knew I needed, I have right here. You do realize you're giving up being a part of the largest digital news community in the country. Yes... because I found my community, and it's here in Lantern Grove. I want to spend Christmas here every year and life here every day. I've been here a few days. I can see the charm. I wish you all the best of luck, and I hope the Lantern Grove Press stays in business for many years to come, even if we don't own it. Thank you. Oh, thank you for understanding. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. [sniffs] Oh, this is my famous gingerbread stuffing. What? No gingerbread crusted casserole? - That is still in the oven. - Good job. Teddy, it looks delicious. - It smells wonderful. - Mmm! Let's eat. Jackie! Uh, Teddy, help me get the rest of the food from the kitchen. You too. To the back. Oh! Thought you left. I, uh... I said no to the offer. You're not selling? You're not leaving any of it? Mm-mm. I'm here to stay. For good. What about your dream? Well, my dream was to run a newsroom. But in this town, I get to do that and be with you. Merry Christmas.
