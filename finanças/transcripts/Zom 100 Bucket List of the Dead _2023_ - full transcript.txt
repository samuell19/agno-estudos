[panting] [runner] What the hell are those things? Zombies? They're clearly zombies, right? - [neighbor screams] - [runner gasps] What do I do? At this rate... At this rate... They're gonna mark me late today at work! KEISEI UNIVERSITY THUNDERS All right. [chuckles] Hello, sir. And good morning! [chuckles] You're quite cheery today, huh? Don't you know it's early on a Monday? I'll be off, sir. Good morning! My thrilling, first full-time job. Good morning! Hello, morning! The company I chose for my new career. A future full of stardust and glory. EMPLOYEE ID I'm Tendo Akira. I'm joining the commercial production division starting right away. In college, I played as a wide receiver, so I've got some strength. [whooping] How energetic, I like it. I've got high hopes for this one. Kosugi, you were energetic just like him once, huh? Hey now, Director. You know I'm plenty fresh still at my age, right? [laughs] [staff laugh] Tendo, your seat is right there. And if you need help at all, then Chief Kosugi has the answers. That's right. Thank you so much. Okay. Back to business. [staff chattering] [Tendo] A job I can be proud of, in a homey atmosphere... - [coworker] Are you using the fax machine? - [coworker 2] I'm one of the... producers here. Ohtori, hi. See you around. Th... Thank you very much. [Tendo] I even have a beautiful senior coworker? This is officially, without a doubt, the perfect place to work! Hey, congrats. You're with Master Shot now. I work on your team, too. Yamaguchi. - Let's work hard, okay? - Let's work hard! - And so do I. Yoshida. - Nice to meet you. - And we have our leader, Kosugi-san. - He already knows. Come on. Kosugi-san is pretty great, you know? - Wow. He is, huh? - Uh-huh. How's that? Huh, how? Just legendary. - Ridiculous! - [Yamaguchi] He's basically a god. [Yoshida] Give me a break, will you? - Hey, Tendo. Sorry, I've got to head out. - [Tendo] Sure. - Good luck. - Thanks. [staff chattering, laughing] How I feel so lucky that I'm working here now. - Hey, knock it off. - That's too soon. - No, no. It's totally true! - All right. Let's wrap things up here. - Let's head out, guys. - [staff] Yes, sir. Uh... Thanks a lot for the welcome party. [Kosugi] Sure. See you tomorrow for a great start! I said, you'll be coming right back in tonight. Right! Huh? [coworker 1] Oh, you shouldn't have crossed him. [background chatter] [coworker 2] What's that? The aquarium set? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm on it. Here. Shooting location maps, so put those in order. Right away! - Right. - Print some sheets. Copies for us all, stat. Uh, right. W-Well, I guess overtime on the first day isn't that unusual. [background chatter continues] I can't believe I pulled an all-nighter. This presentation's stuff's got to be memorized tonight. Keep at it. See ya, folks. [Tendo] This is a second, straight all-nighter? You're back just now? Uh-huh. The perfect workplace. Or so I thought. But really, it's just... toxic as hell! - [Kosugi] Okay, 13, 14, research... - Just Tendo is free right now. - Tendo, you got it? - Uh, yeah. [Kosugi] Okay then, location scouting... - You gotta learn that. - [Kosugi] Tendo, you got it. - Yeah. I'm on it. - [Kosugi] Okay, it's Tendo. - [Kosugi] Tendo's got these. - [coworker] That's perfect. [Tendo] A workplace that feels like home. Where everyone gets together even on our days off. They meant it literally. When the office is your home, there's no commute. And without train fare, you'll be saving money. Ohtori, your presentation, amazing as usual. - Thank you very much. - [applause] MARINE PARADISE AQUARIUM [Tendo] Excuse me, sir. Which do you like better? Think for yourself. Quit asking about every little thing. All right. Then I'll give this one... Hey! You can't just make decisions without my approval, you know. - [Tendo] Then there's Kosugi-san... - I'm sorry. A true leader who can be flexible with orders and expectations while guiding his subordinates. [friend] Just give up already. Better yet, find a new job. [background chatter] [Tendo] Kencho was a teammate who shared the triumph and tears of college football. He's also my best friend in the world. But even so... [sighs] This is actually a serious issue, you know? That's why I'm saying that it's best to just quit. Akira, man. Just live your life the way you want, okay? [background chatter continues] That's your great advice then, huh? Now you're checking your cell phone instead of listening. Hey! This is work related, okay? The daughter of one of my clients is really into me. And she's some kinda active model. [clicks tongue] So you call that work, huh? That seems pretty easy. So should I act like you instead? Just be a loyal dog to please the higher-ups? No, you're the big baby, right? Huh? In that game, you kept bungling opportunities to throw. That's why we lost, coward. [shouting] You're still angry about that, you sad little virgin, aren't you? You're just some second-string hack. Come on then, fight me! - Like that's gonna happen, not a chance! - Step outside! And? Why should I, huh? - Let's settle this! - Not a chance, moron! [crew] Excuse me. Rail's coming through. Coming through. Please make way. If you have some questions or if I can be of help, then please, feel free to ask me. [client] Wonderful. We'll leave it to you. [Ohtori chuckles] - So, uh, let's continue. - Yes. [crew chattering] Akira, you look kind of pale. Are you okay? I... I'm just fine, thanks. You spaced out for a second. [sighs] I'm sorry. Watching your process could be helpful, is all. - You think so? - Yeah. Seriously? Seriously. You're just able to do exactly what you want. And I think that's really impressive. That's not how it is though. Huh? What we really want to do, just falls to the wayside, right? - Ohtori-san! - Yes? - Over here? - Uh, right. Drink these. Take a break, okay? Uh, thanks so much. [Ohtori] Sorry about that. Can you just explain... [Ohtori] Oh, of course, yes. [Kosugi] Tendo! The budget chart's not done. You've been gone for ages. Huh? There's two more days. Are you going to argue or get it done? [scoffs] Just because you were a college athlete don't pretend you're a star, all right? In the real world, that stuff isn't worth anything. Got it? Keep your head down and do what you're told! Come on. I'm sorry. Complete the budget! Don't sit here saying sorry. Hurry! Just do it already, damn it! Do the budget! And order the tools and all the vehicles, then do the cast list. Got it? And you better have it finished when I come back later, okay? Uh, right. Also, oh! The jellyfish. - We need a shot of a jellyfish. - [Yoshida] Yeah. [Tendo] This company is super exploitative. I didn't need Kencho to tell me that. But still... I was lucky to get hired in the first place. And I know I don't have the guts to quit. [announcer on PA] Attention. A train is approaching on track one very shortly. For your safety... [train horn blows] [Tendo] I wish these weren't in the way. If these gates weren't here, I could avoid having to go to work tomorrow. [choking] ALARM - SNOOZE [phone alarm chimes] I don't want to go. - [alarm continues] - I don't want to go. I don't want to go. I don't want to go. I don't want to go. I don't want to go. - [gasping] - [chewing] Uh, hello, sir? Sir, good morning. [chewing stops, slurps] [breathing raggedly] Huh? [groans] [grunting] [Tendo] Huh? [bones cracking] Huh? - [screaming] - [snarling] [panting] - [zombies groan, snarl] - [Tendo gasps] - [zombies groaning] - [Tendo screams] What the hell are those things? [Tendo gasps] Zombies? They're clearly zombies, right? - [neighbor screams] - [Tendo screams] What do I do? At this rate... - At this rate... - [grunts] [panting heavily] They're gonna mark me late today at work! - Whoa! - [zombie shrieks] [panting] [grunts, pants] [zombies hissing] Ooh! Ooh! [grunts] [snarling, hissing] [Tendo exclaims] - [shouting] - [airplane passing overhead] [sirens wailing in distance] [Tendo] Hey, wait a minute. Could this mean... Maybe, just maybe... today I don't need to come into work? Hell yeah! ZOM 100: BUCKET LIST OF THE DEAD [birds chirping] I didn't know just how beautiful the world is, huh? [snarling, groaning] [grunts, chuckles] Not going into the office today - is so great! [laughs] - [zombies groaning] Oh, what should I do then with the day? I haven't had a free day in ages. Wait, since when? Did a year pass? But that's so long! Then I shouldn't just stay in and rest, right? [laughs] - [zombies groaning] - [Tendo continues laughing] [grunts] [sighs] Ohtori-san, are you all right? [typing] ARE YOU OKAY, OHTORI? COME HERE. SAORI OHTORI Yes! [reporter] Attacks by people gone berserk are increasing throughout the entire city. The cause is believed to be a disease, though the origin is unknown. TOKYO SHIBUYA NEWS FLASH - RIOTS ACROSS KANTO - According to posts on social media... - We're done for, aren't we? [reporter] ...most cases involve people who turn violent after they are bitten. Sumire? [reporter] It's important to avoid anyone with these symptoms. Let's keep on hoping. - We'll keep on taking things day by day. - Be serious! We can't even step outside our house! [Tendo] Oh, good morning! [chuckles] Oh, sorry I'm in your window here. Uh, it's fine. Uh, what is it? I was heading into town and stopped to ask you if there are any supplies you might want? I'll stop by a convenient store. Oh, I guess cup ramen, if you don't mind. Uh, and fruit, if you could possibly get some. Okay. [grunting] [upbeat music playing] HOSPITAL [zombies groaning, snarling] - [bicycle bell rings] - [zombies groaning] [screams] I'm on my way, Ohtori-san! - [music ends] - [doorbell chiming] Oh... Ohtori-san? I... I'm sorry I kept you waiting. I'll come in, okay? Sorry to walk in like this. Ohtori-san? - [gasps] - [panting] [sighs] Akira! Are... Are you here alone and scared? No, he's here! - [thuds] - [zombie gurgling] [groaning] [bones cracking] D-Director? - Wh... What? Why are you... - [snarls] - [Tendo grunts] - [thuds] Come on. You've been hurt?

Ohtori-san? [bones cracking] Those wounds... [bones crack] [groaning] [snarls] [Tendo grunting] - [Tendo grunts] - [body thuds] [Tendo pants] [Ohtori groaning] - [groaning continues] - [bones crack] Ohtori-san!

[Ohtori groaning, banging] - [grunting] - [zombies snarling] [Tendo gasps] [no audible dialogue] [sobbing] [sighs] What we really wanna do just falls to the wayside, right? What I... really wanna do. If I can't live my life the way I want... I'm better off as zombie food. Mm-hmm. Okay. Let's see... [scribbling] 100 THINGS I WANT TO DO BEFORE BECOMING A ZOMBIE 1.

[chuckles] Please no. [grunts] No, come on. Now of all times? Really? [sighs] If I have to eat to eat this delicious steak plain after all my efforts to get it... I'm better off as zombie food! Found it! YAKINIKU SAUCE All right! Whoa, salt. Okay, nice. What else do I... [clattering] [Tendo grunts] No, no, no, no, no.

[sighs] [survivor grunts] Why are you here? Going on a rampage all of a... [pants] What is it? Uh, I just... I was startled. [chuckles] But I'm sure with things like the way they are now, I can't blame you for being so distrusting out here, can I? You scared me too just now. With how things are, I never thought someone would go out for luxuries like that. [Tendo] Huh? Yeah, but... SAKE That... This is just for cooking, that's all. [stranger] Help me! Please help me!

It's just, it's been kinda lonely and you saved me from that guy... Please. I didn't save anyone. I'm simply keeping myself alive, okay? [chuckles] Come on, now. There you go again. - Hey! Don't get any closer. - Huh? Men like you are always rescuing somebody. Bringing trouble along with you wherever you go. And you'll just keep attracting more and more danger. Yes, but when things get hard, we... No. When things get this hard, the risk is too great to help anyone. [zombies groaning] [sighs] [Kencho] Akira, man. Just live your life the way you want, okay? You're still angry about that, you sad little virgin, aren't you? You're just some second-string hack. Come on then, fight me. Why should I, huh? [sighs] [zombie wheezing] [cell phone rings] [zombies snarl] [line ringing] [Kencho] Akira? Oh! You're there. Kencho, you're all right! What do you want? Don't startle me like that. Well, that's not nice of you. I've been, you know... It's just... Well, that's why I called. Huh? [sniffles] What are you talking about? I... It's cause I... wanted to see if you're all right. [scoffs] Oh, thanks, Dad. [chuckles] So how are you? Well, I might die soon. Tell me where you are. Huh? A love hotel. Huh? - I said a love hotel, dude! - [zombie snarling] It's in Kabukicho. A place called Sweet Magic. I can't make it past all the monsters, here. So I might die here. All right. I'll come to you then. Huh? Man, stop being crazy. I'll still go. If losing you is the alternative, I'm better off zombie food! [alarm blares] [grunts] [zombies snarling, hissing] [zombies continue snarling] - [Tendo grunts] - [body thuds] - [zombie wheezing] - Whoa! - [engine revs] - [tires squeal] Just hang on, Kencho! - [zombies groaning] - [Kencho gasps] - [Kencho screams] - [zombies snarl] - [pounding on door] - [chains rattling] - [whimpers] - [rattling continues] [pounding continues] [Tendo] Hey! Hey! [audience cheering] Kencho, hurry! [Tendo] In that game, you kept bungling opportunities to throw. That's why we lost, coward. [Kencho grunts] [whistle blows] [sobbing] - [pounding] - [whimpers] Oh, shit! KABUKICHO ICHIBAN-GAI [zombies groaning] [motorcycle approaching] [brakes squeal] [chomps] [snarling] [engine stops] [speaker chimes] [upbeat music playing] [zombies groaning] [music continues] Here goes nothing.

[grunting continues] - [Tendo grunts] - [zombies snarl] [pants] [Tendo shouts] [panting] [zombie wheezing] [Kencho screams] [Tendo] Kencho! Akira. - Oh, man. You're here... - Kencho. I'm sorry! The things I said that night were wrong. You were successful at work, and having so much fun. I was jealous and I took it out on you. Kencho, I'm sorry! So you just came to get me out? No, I was the one. I'm sorry... - [footsteps approaching] - [zombie wheezing] [whispers] We're gonna head to the roof, okay? [zombies snarl] - [both panting] - [zombies snarling] [Kencho] All right, looking good. Let's eat! Wow! Man, it looks good. Amazing, Kencho! It's great. Wow! I definitely used up all their ingredients. - [Tendo laughs] - Here. Well, let's drink to our reunion. [both] We're back! [Kencho sighs contentedly] That hits the spot. [Tendo] What a great meal! I'm way too full now. [both laugh] What's this? "Wine and dine a flight attendant." "Go on a road trip in a camper." [chuckle] Level with me. You're pretty far from a hundred here. [Tendo chuckles] Then try to make yours. It's harder to pick than you think. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. 12. FIND MY BEST FRIEND AND APOLOGIZE PROPERLY [Tendo grunts] - [glass thuds] - [Tendo sighs] [clears throat] [both chuckle] Well, thanks for risking your life like that. Of course, man. Why wouldn't I? I think it might be guys like you who keep on protecting us from danger during hard times like this. [chuckles] Protect... us all? Huh? What is it? It's like my greatest wish come true. Huh? I didn't think dreams could happen in real life. If... If it's what I really want, should I put all my effort in? Uh... Sure. Do your best, right? Why not? You only live once, man, right? You've got me at your side too. Kencho! You're the best friend I could ask for. I got it. All right. What do you think you'll do for work then, huh? [scribbling] Yeah. What I truly wanna do as I go forward is right here! 13. BECOME A SUPERHERO WHO SAVES EVERYONE So, like Superman, huh? [chuckles] Exactly! - Or Spider-Man, right? - [chuckles] Yeah, totally. That's pretty cool, just... [Tendo] Hmm? Look, man. You can't fly, or, uh... shoot anything out of your hands, right? [radio host] ...Really surrounded and are in great danger. Electricity, running water, and other city infrastructure have grown unstable, and food shortages occur throughout Tokyo. Anyone listening to this should... [people screaming] [Kencho] Man, this is really bad, Akira. Central Tokyo is a total mess. We should probably get out of Tokyo as soon as we can. I've got a place already. Huh? Where's that? In Ibaraki. At the Marine Paradise Aquarium. [Kencho] But why an aquarium? They have a certain something I'd like to get. Huh? That? [Kencho] Hmm? A shark suit, you see? It's a diving suit they developed that can protect your entire body from sharks. With a steel suit like this one here, zombies can't bite through my skin. Superhero's need their suits to fight off evil, you know? I mean, that's... That's totally... Great idea! Nice, dude. Let's get that suit, huh? Okay! So then, let's see where we can get some supplies, okay? Isn't there a Don Quijote right here? UNBELIEVABLY CHEAP DON QUIJOTE [zombies groaning] [Tendo] Huh... A camper, right here. Hey, we need to get our supplies. Come on. Huh? Yeah, but it's a camper, right here... Just save it for later. - What? - Come on. Let's go. - It's here. A camper... - [shushes] KABUKICHO LOCATION [both] One, two... - [tires squeal] - [vehicle crashes] - [thudding] - [glass shatters] [people screaming] [whimpers] - [screaming continues] - [zombies snarling] [screaming] Over here! Over here, everyone! Hurry! - [Kencho grunts] - [shutters open] Hurry, get inside! Get in here! Hurry! [survivor panting] - [zombies snarl] - Zombies! [survivor grunts] You again? - [zombies snarling] - [survivor grunts] Hey, behind her. Look out! Your six! [grunts] Hurry! [grunting] [gasps] [both grunt] - [panting] - [rattling, banging] [all panting] [sighs] Oh, my god! Thanks. You saved our lives just now. Thank you. [panting] You actually did it! You really are a hero. Look at you, huh? - Wow! - [Tendo] Come on. That hurts! [Kencho] Just like Superman! Spider-Man! Anpanman! [both laugh] [driver] We heard there was a place where we could all be safe from the zombies. [inhales sharply] So we were on our way there. - There's someplace that's safe? - [passenger] You don't know? I thought everyone had heard. Ibaraki. It's got that Marine Paradise Aquarium there. Marine Paradise you said? [driver] Uh, yeah. With barricades so the zombies can't get through, and with all the fish, there's no chance of a food shortage. So, you boarded to go there, miss? Yeah. I'd heard it was a secure way to go all the way there. It's my fault. All this, I know. How could I ever apologize to everyone? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry. Oh, no man. It's fine. What's done is done, right? Yeah. Please forgive me. [passenger 2 exclaims] [passenger sighs] Oh, man. - What is it? - Uh, it's nothing. You seem to be enjoying that. At times like this, who wouldn't drink? [both] Right? - [sighs] - Want some too? Thanks, no. I'll take a walk around since the perimeter needs guarding. Serious type, huh? And? You two joining? - [passenger] Hey! - [driver snoring] - Stop! [giggles] - [all laugh] Anyway, we were on a return flight out of LA, right? - [passenger 2] Yeah. - We got back, it was like this. - Man, this sucks, huh? - Mm-hmm. What do you guys do for work? Are you, uh... Flight attendants. [chuckles] [flight attendant] Hey, look, look. [flight attendants giggle] [flight attendant] Oh, man. He gets drunk so easily. HAVE DRINKS WITH A FLIGHT ATTENDANT [flight attendant 2] Super easy. [laughs] Hey, wait. Who's going to drive us home now? [flight attendants laugh] [flight attendant] Even though it was his fault. [flight attendant 2] I'm tearing up. [flight attendants laugh] - [flight attendants sigh] - Uh, you know... Reika and Maki, I was wondering if you're single. Huh? Your timing sucks. [Kencho laughs] I'm sorry. My mistake. [Kencho] Please forgive him. He's just not used to being around women. That's all. [Reika] No, it's fine. It's fine. [Kencho] Hey, your nails are really pretty. [Reika laughs] What? - Yeah, they're super cute. - [Reika] Oh, you noticed. You noticed. - [Maki] Huh? - [Kencho] What? Hey, you've got muscles, don't ya? - [Kencho] Oh, really? - Yeah. Well, I'm strong, you see, so that I can make sure my Maki's safe, right? [laughs] Please protect me. Please, Kencho. [Reika] Hey! Can you carry us away to the little girls? Hey, Reika, you're not trying to get Kencho on his own or something, are you? - Hey now. - Yeah, but what if I am, huh? - [speaks indistinctly] - Okay, please ladies. I've got an idea. Why don't the three of us go together? - [both] Shall we? - Shall we? [both] Let's go, yeah. - [Maki] Oh, man, I'm so drunk. - [Kencho] Too drunk, I'd say. - [Reika, Maki laughing] - Can you walk? Can you walk? - [Kencho grunts] - [Maki] Be careful, don't... - Hey, sorry. - [Reika] Hey, look, there are costumes. [Maki laughing] There are costumes here. - [tapping] - [Tendo groans] - [thuds] - Ow. What are you doing? Uh... Oh, I've just been resting. Well, thanks for patrolling. [scoffs] Please don't. I'm protecting myself, that's all. Right. Of course you are, yeah. [stammers] I'll introduce myself, finally. Hi, Tendo Akira. Pleasure. - [survivor] Your hand... - Huh? Oh. When I closed the doors, I guess I must've cut it, huh? - I'm all right. It's just a... - Let me see it. Right. Um, so, are you like a nurse or anything like that? No, but I studied to be a doctor once. That's all. So, how about now? You don't need to know all that. Anyways, aren't you guys... Yeah? Aren't you taking this situation way too lightly? What's that mean, though? I just wanna keep myself away from the zombies and survive all this. You guys do whatever you want and pretend it's fine. Do you truly think you'll survive that way? [nervous chuckle] That... They always say that guys like you get targeted first in this kind of situation, right? You just let your guard down and bang, you know? [driver snarls] [survivor] Hmm? [gurgles, spits] [bones crack] [groans] [ragged breathing] [bone cracks] [bottle clinks] - [snarls] - [Tendo screams] - [Kencho] No, not that one. - [Reika] What about this one? - [Maki] No way. This one. - [Kencho] Matching? - [indistinct chatter] - [laughing] [both] Attention, please! [guffawing] Hot damn! Real flight attendants! Seat belts should stay tight and low over your waist. If you please, sir. - Yes. [laughs] - [chuckles] [Maki giggles] And as we're approaching altitude, things could get just a little bit rough. Right. [chuckles] Sounds all right. [giggles] You're happy with our service, then? Thrilled, ladies. [chuckles] Preparing engines, we're ready for blast off. - [grunts] - Looks like we've begun climbing, sir. - Oh, yeah. It's climbing now. [chuckles] - [both giggling] So if you please... [both] Enjoy your time in the sky. Turbulence! - [giggles] So good. - [Kencho groans] It feels good? - Wow. - What shall we do with this? [Reika giggles] - [chomps] - [Maki screaming] - [chewing] - [Kencho] Maki! - Get off! Stop it! [screams] - [chewing continues] - What are you doing? - Let her go! - [Reika] You dirty old man, stop! - [Kencho] Bad timing! - Get off of her. - What are you trying to do? Just get off! - [zombie snarls] - [Reika screaming] - Get off! - [chewing continues] [screams] [panting] [both panting] - [whimpers] - [Maki gurgling] - Maki! No! - [gurgling continues] Reika! Hey! [zombie hisses] I'm sorry! [whimpers] [Kencho screaming] Kencho. Hang on! Where are you going? It's not safe alone. - 'Cause you guys don't cause much trouble. - I guess, but... I've survived all alone this far. So I'll keep surviving on my own. [Kencho screaming in distance] - [Kencho] Get away from me! - [driver snarls] [driver hisses] [panting] [toy squeaks] [hissing] [muffled gasp] - [hissing continues] - [neck cracks] [music playing on speakers] - [snarls] - [Kencho gasps] [gasps] [music continues playing] [driver snarling] [grunting] [Reika and Maki snarling, groaning] [bones cracking] [grunts] Come on. This is why I don't work with others. - [Maki snarls] - [bones crack] - [music continues] - [survivor grunting] [driver snarls] [survivor grunting in distance] [music stops] - [grunting] - [zombies snarling] [fireworks crackling] [metal creaks] - This way. - [fireworks crackling, popping] [fireworks continue crackling] [all] One, two... [straining] [fireworks crackling in distance] Let's find a car. Shit! There's no key! This one's good! - Oh! - [zombies banging on shutters] [zombies snarling, hissing] [engine cranks] [engine starts] Hey, you! Get in! Hurry! - [survivor sighs] - You really cut it close there. So, I'm confused, guys. Why did you save me in there? You don't get it? You needed our help, of course. You could've been killed helping like that. - It was just stupid to come back in. - That's just what a superhero does. Huh? What was that? - So brainless. - He's not brainless. Akira truly wants to be a superhero, you know? [sighs] I just can't take this. Let's get to the aquarium and then I'll get out there. Oh, actually, you know, reaching the aquarium was our plan, so we were heading there too. Why don't we be teammates? [scoffs] No, thank you. Yeah, but you could get hurt by yourself. Especially with no car. Have you ever even driven a car? No, I don't have a license. Then it's not a great idea to try and start learning now, right? Shizuka. Huh? My name, okay? So that you can stop calling me "hey, you." It's annoying. [chuckles] Shizuka-san, huh? - Oh, this here is Kencho. - Don't bother. What sort of attitude is that, huh? Try saying, "Thank you so much" or "Let's have a good trip", you know? Try a little, huh? I never asked you guys to help me out. - Why, you little brat! - Stop, stop, stop it. [nervous chuckle] Um, until we reach the aquarium, let's... let's think of this journey as a road trip with the three of us, all right? - We could visit an onsen. - Impossible. No way I'd go. - You need to take this seriously. - [Tendo] Oh? But this drink is just meant for an onsen. - It's sake. - Sake? [gasps] Just think, this deliciously chilled sake - as the hot spring waters revive you. - [gulps] [Tendo] That would be so much fun to try, right? W-Well, it's true the driver needs to rest a little, right? And a hot spring certainly wouldn't delay us a whole lot anyway. [Tendo chuckles] Well, you sure changed your mind. In-In any case, you guys are sort of stinky. Huh? [Tendo sniffing] [Shizuka sniffing] [continues sniffing] [chuckles] SWEET POTATO JERKY [Shizuka] You okay? Are you hungry? - [dog whines] - You are, aren't you? - Why dye your hair blond all of a sudden? - [Shizuka] You need food, huh? Dropouts are always the blond ones. [Tendo chuckles] [dog whines, barks] [Tendo] Hmm. Here. - [dog whimpers] - Yeah, you're hungry, aren't you? There. - Let's unchain you. - [dog whimpers] [Kencho and Tendo] Mm-hmm. [Tendo] Take care. [Shizuka] Wait, I've never done this. [Tendo] It's my first time too. It's okay. - [Shizuka] But I... I just can't! - Hey, it'll be fun though! - [Shizuka] No way, I'm going back. - [Tendo] Going back where, Shizuka? - I just can't do it, okay? Let me go. - We'll have fun, I swear. [Kencho] Left hand raised and keep it held right there. - Okay. - And your left leg points straight back. - Wh... Whoa! - All right, next. Your arm comes straight forward. TRY SUP YOGA - Oh, man. - It's pretty hard, huh? - Like this? - [Kencho] That's it. - Akira, you okay? - Oh! - Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. - [Kencho] The crescent moon pose. Well done. You're pretty good at this. - [Tendo] Whoa! - [Shizuka grunts] - Whoa! [laughs] Nice. - Check this. - Pretty cool. - [Shizuka] Impressive! - Skilled. Then you twist down like this. - [Tendo] Yeah. - [stammering] - [Tendo laughs] - [Kencho gasps, pants] - [laughs] - It's freezing! - [Tendo laughs] [Kencho] The water's cold. It's freezing. [coughing, gasping] So cold! [laughs] [Tendo cheers] [zombies grunting] [Tendo] Kencho! - [laughs] - Akira, feels great, right? - [laughs] - Oh, my God. Don't look. - We're so high! - [Tendo laughs] We are! - Wow, but... This feels great. - [Tendo] Yeah, it's great, right? [Tendo cheers] GO PARAGLIDING - Yeah! - It's so fun! [all] Let's dig in! [Kencho and Tendo] Mmm. - Oh, it looks good. - Amazing. [laughs] [loud slurping] Mmm. Wow! [moans] So good. [moans] It's yummy, I swear. - Look, it's already melting! - Oh! - [Kencho] Come on. It hit mine. - Ah, it did not. - [Kencho] No, it did. I just saw it. - It did not. MAKE A CAMPFIRE - [Kencho] I can't believe you. - [Shizuka] Yeah, yeah. - [Shizuka] Whoo! - [Tendo] Whoo-hoo! [all laughing] SHINTANI HOT SPRING 1KM [zombies groaning] [unintelligible grunting] HANAZAKURA [gulps] [sighs deeply] So delicious. [Kencho sighs] I can feel it in my veins. This trip has been long. We should reach the aquarium tomorrow. Then I guess Shizuka will make her own way? [Kencho] What is it? You're about to get the suit you wanted. Be a little happier. You're right. It's just that... It's been a... a lot of fun, hasn't it? [Kencho] Yeah. Yeah, it has. [Tendo] Oh! Sh-Shizuka-san, come over here! [chuckles] It's lovely, right? Just this once, you'll get to hear me say this out loud. Th... Thank you for helping me in the store that day. Shizuka-san. You're starting to chill out a little, huh? Aren't you? Don't you even think of trying that again, you idiot. - [laughs] Idiot? Come on. - Yeah. - Hey, that's going way too far. - [Shizuka grunts] [all laughing] [Kencho] That's way too far. [snoring] Mmm... I want sake. Make it hot. Hot sake. [sighs] Hot sake. [Kencho continues snoring] [chuckles] Is that it? - [Tendo] Whoa! - [Shizuka gasps] Wow! We're finally here! - [Kencho] The aquarium. - [Tendo] Finally. [Kencho] There must be giant fish, huh? [Tendo] Yeah, and a whole bunch of sharks, right? [tires burst] [tires squeal] [loud crash] [air hisses] [Kosugi, echoing] Tendo! Tendo! Wake up, Tendo! Hey, Tendo! [normal] How long are you gonna lie there asleep? Wake up already, Tendo! [gasps] I'm so sorry, sir! [chuckles] [sighs] I see. Dreaming, huh? Still sleepy, huh, Akira? [gasps] Kosugi-san! What... Ah, it seems you're up at long last, huh? Great. Let's get going. I'll show you around. Huh? - [survivors chattering] - [worker] Uh, yes. I have eight boxes of this one. [Kosugi] This is a perfect fortress for us, - where our food supply and our safety... - Hello, chief. - ...are completely guaranteed. - [worker 2] Hello, chief. [Kosugi] Or I guess we could call it "our company." The pandemic struck right as we were filming that commercial here. But it was my decision to turn this into a shelter that led to our success. I mean, food's not a worry here, right? [chuckles] - [worker 3] Hello, chief. - [Kosugi] Yo. Hello. [chattering continues] [worker] I feel like I haven't done anything and I'm still exhausted. Exactly. - Oh, it's you! - [worker] Can you hand me that... [gasps] The man. Sumire. [worker] Um, maybe you guys can unload some of those boxes. - Both of us were worried. - Yeah. Tendo! Quit talking. Hurry. - Uh, yes. I'm sorry. - [worker] He's so grumpy all the time. And pushy. What does he expect us to do? They treat us like crap here. - [sighs] Hey. - Hello, chief. - Oh my gosh. - [worker 4] To the right. All right, right there. Perfect. All of these people heard rumors of safety and made their way here. - [Yamaguchi] Be precise. - [worker 5] The boss is coming. - Just do it right or I'll... - Hey. - Oh, hello, chief. - Yeah. [Kosugi] Teams for transport, waste-processing, and lots of others. We've got them all working for the sake of the company. They're potatoes, they're not that hard to peel. - Uh, hello, chief. Hello, hello. - [worker 6] No, no. Not like that. [Kosugi] Oh, the quotas might be a little strict around here. But if we don't run a tight shift we can't take care of all these guys. - [worker 7] Fly it right over here. - [worker 8] Hey! [worker 7] Yeah, fly it right over here. Hey, come on. Do this over again. Over here. Shizuka-san! Kencho! Now then, Tendo. It's time we bring you onboard again. - [worker 8] Just go already. - It's just... Oh, that's right. You haven't met our security team yet, have you? Hey, Tendo! - Hurry. This way. - Yes. [zombies groaning] [Tendo] What is this? They're... Our supply and resource team is heading out. Watch. [siren wailing] [zombies snarl] And that right there is our zombie security team. Our company has built quite the reputation, to the extent that bandits try to raid our food supplies. [dispatch] The buses are here. [Kosugi] Those zombies are the perfect way to scare off anyone looking to steal from us. [transporter] Roger that. Truck coming through now. - [siren ends] - [Kosugi] If you use them right, it turns out, they actually make a great labor force. In fact, I'd say they're exemplary employees who work without complaint. Tendo, you were that way too, weren't you? Huh? I always had high expectations for your career. I thought you might even become my right-hand man one day. [chuckles] You were molded with that very intent. I'd be pleased to have you back at my side once again. [Tendo shudders] The bucket list, I haven't finished it yet. Got a list, do ya? And is that list worth more than your friends? Huh? Your friends will be safe forever if you decide to stay here with us. So make the only moral decision... and choose to remain with us. Okay? [Kosugi chuckles] - [dishes clank] - [chattering] EMERGENCY FOOD SUPPLIES LONG-LIFE BREAD - [Yamaguchi] Mmm. - [Kosugi sighs] Delicious. Tendo! Seconds! [stammers] Oh, yes, sir. Right away. - [Yoshida] Delicious. - [group cheers] - [Yamaguchi] Tendo, for me too. - Oh, right. - So fresh, right? - So fresh I shouldn't have to tell you. - [Tendo] Oh, I'm sorry. - Yeah. - Oh, Tendo, me too. - Uh, right. - You can't! - [Tendo] Uh, yes, sir. If you say anything, they'll kick you out. Yeah? That sounds all right. The whole unit. All of us get thrown out. So please, sir. Hold it in. - [group chattering] - [utensils clanking] [huffs] [chattering continues] [Yamaguchi] Sunfish. - [Yoshida] Sunfish. - [Yamaguchi] Mm-hmm. [laughing] - [Yoshida] There's shrimp too? - [Kosugi] You look like a sunfish. - You, you're a sea anemone. - [Yoshida] What? Sea anemone? [Kosugi laughs] Why don't you get in that tank, swim around a little bit? [Yamaguchi] He does though. He really does. - [Yoshida] Hurry up, will ya. - [Kosugi] Keep your clothes on. - Go do it now. - [Yoshida laughs] Take a walk. We need more ice here! In your condition, it's not enough. - Well, yes, but... - Please go ahead and eat. All the bonito's got iron which is what the child needs so it can grow even stronger. [Kosugi] Tendo, come here. Come back. Get over here. Thank you very much. I could try to get you out of here if you'd like. [Kosugi] Tendo! Don't wait until you're told. - Think ahead. - [stammers] I'm sorry. - [Yoshida] Quiet down. - [Kosugi] Make it again. - Hey. Just shut it. - I'm sorry. [zombies groaning] [snoring] [whispering] All clear. NAKAYA FRESH FOODS [sighs] [grunts] - Mmm. - [lighter clicks] [thud] [Sumire's husband] These are the cars of all the people who fled here. If one's driveable, then you can use it to run away. Yeah, but if we take... It's all right. No one here intends to leave this place. Those of us who can't survive alone out there, this is where we must remain. It's how it is. [siren wailing] [dispatch] Delivery truck coming through. Return the bus to its original position. [transporter] Roger that. Turn the bus. - Go ahead, bus. - [dispatch] Okay. [zombie snarling] [screams] - Hey! - [zombie snarls] - [grunts, screams] - [crunching] [dispatch] Stop, stop! Hold it! Stop the bus! Reverse it! [guards screaming] [dispatch] Hurry! - [people screaming] - [zombies snarling] - [cleaner] All clear? - All right. SHARK EXHIBITION - [cleaner 1] Okay. Let's get started. - [cleaners 2 and 3] Yes, sir. [zombies snarling] [gasps] [gurgling] Take a look. I got the tire fixed. What do you think? All we have to do now is load the camper and leave. Now you can tell Chief Asshole goodbye for good. Uh, listen. Hmm? To what? Shouldn't we just stay here together? What? Why stay here? W... Well, it's... The aquarium is... It's way safer. My thought is just that going away isn't the best choice, really. And Kosugi told me that too. Hey, Akira. What's happening? You're acting so different. Actually, Akira, you're not wrong about being safer here. I guess I'll go back to work. [Kencho] Damn it. Well, I... won't just stay here and rot. 100 THINGS I WANT TO DO BEFORE BECOMING A ZOMBIE 13. BECOME A SUPERHERO WHO SAVES EVERYONE [chuckles] 14. TRY SUP YOGA 15. GO PARAGLIDING 16. MAKE A CAMPFIRE [gasps] You're so... brainless, huh? - [Yamaguchi] Aren't we short on staff? - [Yoshida] You're right. Where did the others go, huh? [Yoshida] There's way too few of you. [Kosugi] Hey, where are those two slacking off, huh? - Answer me now! - [Yoshida] Don't just stare. - Hey! Is it really true? - [Yamaguchi] Say something! [Yoshida] This isn't what's on the schedule. - [Yamaguchi] Talk now! - Hey, where the hell were you guys? Hey! [Yoshida] Hey, you! Cut it out! Stop! [Kencho] Let me go! [grunts] Let me go! We're gonna head out now, the two of us. So let me ask you again, will you go with us? I mean, we're... Being together is really important, and I think right here's the best place to stay safe. [claps] Tendo, you are so right. [clicks tongue] A bunch of pitiful weaklings like you guys couldn't survive without me, as you all know. - [laughs] - [grunts] - [Yoshida] Hey. Hey! - [Yamaguchi] Don't. We should stay put here. Just be compliant. You shouldn't rely on anybody. Things we've been told will keep us secure. Well, I believed all that. I'll break free of it now! You chase your dreams no matter what. Being with you this last week, I saw more than I ever had before meeting you. I tried new things I wouldn't have before. And I just thought it was all... lots of fun, you know? [scoffs] When a tomorrow isn't guaranteed, no one know exactly which decisions will end up working out. But still, at the very least, I know this much... we're just zombies if we stay here anyway. Unbelievable. This is why women are always such pains, huh? They get hysterical right from the start, so talking is just a waste of time. Right, Tendo? Zombies can't have bucket lists. And this is your list, so let's go. Isn't it? Akira, it's your choice now. Hurry and choose. [Kosugi] Hey, you can't just make decisions... - Gotta be memorized tonight. - [Tendo] Yeah. I don't want to go. What we really want to do just falls to the wayside. Keep your head down and do what you're told! Tendo! [Tendo] Today, I don't need to come into work? - Hell yeah! - I've been in love with you since then. 17. CROSS-COUNTRY TRIP AS A TRIO If I can't live my life the way I want, I'm better off as zombie food. I didn't think dreams could happen in real life. If what I really want, should I put all my effort in? - Well, thanks for risking your life. - Thank you in the store that day. [all cheering] We're finally here! 17. CROSS-COUNTRY TRIP AS A TRIO [Kencho] Akira, man. Just live your life the way you want, okay? Nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. - Get lost! - [Shizuka grunts] What kind of a sad list is this? Come on, man. - [Kosugi grunts] - [Kencho] Hey! Hey! You can't do this, you bastards! [groans] What do you think you're doing? [Yoshida] Are you okay? Kosugi, sir, I've made many immature choices since I started. So thank you for guiding my way. - Huh? - [Tendo] However... I want to say that I, Tendo Akira, as of today, will no longer work for the company, sir. [grunts] What's that? Sorry, I can't keep working for you anymore, sir. In fact, sir, I never want to see you again. - You're gonna regret this! - [Tendo] Even so... it's still a whole lot better choice than such a zombie-like existence. - [screaming] - [zombies snarling] Over here! Everyone, this way. Hurry! That way! Hurry! Hurry! Quickly! Come on. [zombie snarling] [stammers] What about our security? [Yoshida and Yamaguchi grunt] [Yamaguchi] Kosugi-san! - [Tendo] Get going! - [screams] [both] Kosugi-san! - [screaming] - [zombies snarling] - [Yamaguchi] Hurry! - [Yoshida] Help me! Hold it! Hold it, hold it, hold it! [Tendo grunts] - Go, run! - Tendo? - Hurry! - [Yamaguchi panting] Oh, no. Hey! Hurry, hurry! Akira! Akira! [banging on door] [zombies snarling] [banging continues] [panting heavily] You rescued us, Tendo. Thanks for that. [Yamaguchi] Thank you. Let's all head away from the door. [Yoshida] Yamaguchi, let's go. [door opens] - [gasps] - Whoa! Hey! [Kosugi muttering] [scoffs] What the hell? It's that asshole. - Out of my way! - Are you okay there? - Hey! - You bastard, you just ran away! I thought you were the chief here! Aren't you? - [Kosugi] Let go. - Kencho. - [Yoshida] Leave Kosugi-san alone! - [Tendo] Let go, man! - Go on and say something, dumbass! - Ow, ow, ow! What, is that all you can say? - [rumbling] - [survivors gasp] - What was that? - [rumbling continues] Whoa, Kosugi... [zombie shark gulps, burps] [gurgling] [Tendo] Hurry! Run! - Go! Hurry up! - Hey, don't panic. - [zombie shark gurgles] - [Shizuka] It won't attack on land. - What the hell is that gigantic thing? - Well, take a look. Lamniformes. Lamnidae. Great white shark. - [zombie shark snarling] - [bones cracking] You're kidding, right? [zombie shark snarls] We better run! [people screaming] Uh-oh. Not again! [all gasp, scream] [zombie shark gurgling] - [zombie shark snarls] - [all scream] [Tendo] We can't stay here. This way! It can't get in here! Hurry! Get in here! [gurgling, squelching] - [Kencho] Hurry! - [Tendo] Kencho, stay back! [zombie shark gurgling, squelching] [panting] - [loud bang] - [survivors scream] - [grunts] Push at it! - [zombie shark snarls] [loud bang] [zombie shark gurgles, snarls] - [loud bang] - [all grunting] - [zombie shark snarls] - [bang] - [bang] - [zombie shark gurgles] - [metal clanks] - [Kosugi squeaks] [squelching stops] [gurgle] [all pant, sigh] Just calm down. Breathe nice and slow. You're okay. [Sumire] Yes, thank you. [pants] [all panting, groaning] Uh, Kosugi's not here. He's still out there, huh? That seems fair. [sighs] I need to go out there. Why would you? All that your dumb boss does is treat you like dirt. I know, but... my boss getting eaten by a giant zombie shark right outside is not on this list! But first... a superhero would wear a suit, right? - [screaming] - [zombie shark gurgles] - [gasps] - [snarling] [footsteps approaching] - [screaming] - [Tendo shouts] [zombie shark groans] You'll be okay, Chief Kosugi. [stammering] Tendo! Just let me take care of this. You came up with some great ideas, right? Nope. No ideas. Not at all? [yelping] - [zombie shark snarls] - [Tendo grunts] - No, don't! Leave it shut! - [zombies snarling] [Kosugi screams] Tendo. Tendo! Just hang on to that thing, okay? - [zombies snarling] - [Kosugi screams] [Kosugi] Hey, quit following me! [Kencho] Akira! Hang on! Leave it to me! [engine running] [panting] Kencho! [strains] [engine revs] - Come try this on! - [tires squeal] - [zombies snarling] - [Kosugi panting, screaming] Come on! Chief! Hey! - [grunts] - [zombies snarling] Just run! - Ah! - [gasps] - Tendo, best of luck! - [Tendo struggling] [zombie shark snarls] [tires squeal] You're a gigantic fish, aren't ya? [tires continue squealing] Well, mankind has got gigantic brains, all right? - [zombies snarling] - [Tendo grunting] Huh? [gasps] - [Tendo shouts] - [zombies snarling] [tires squealing] This thing's super strong, huh? [snarl] - Okay. - [zombie shark rumbles] For now, I'll let you off easy, bro. [zombie shark snarls] - [zombies snarling] - [Tendo] Whoa! It's no use, zombie creeps. - I'm resistant to your attacks. - [chomps] Ow, ow, ow! [whimpers] All your teeth are blocked! Still pinches like crazy though, I guess. Ow, ow, ow! [panting] [zombie shark snarls] [zombie shark snarls] [coughs] [zombie shark snarls] - This is bad. [grunting] - [zombies chewing] [music playing] [zombies gurgle] [music continues playing] Shizuka-san? [grunts] [zombies snarling] [Shizuka grunts] Run away! Try and do your worst! [music continues playing] [Tendo] Whoa! Amazing! You're so cool! Shizuka-san! [laughs] [music ends] - You okay? - Uh, it-it hurts. [chuckles] Thanks so much. [groans, sighs] - [Kencho panting] - Oh, Kencho. - Akira, you all right? - [panting] Yeah. - What about you? - Yeah. See? [laughs] I've been decorating the walls. [zombie shark snarls] [all laughing] [groans] Ah, that hurts. [all laughing, panting] [Kosugi] Tendo! [laughing] You did great! You've got moves, I'll give it to you. - [sighs] Kosugi-san? - You prick. Calm down, calm down, please. The zombies all met their ends, and that big shark must be kaput. [laughs] - Look at... - [zombie shark snarls] [zombie shark squelches] Hang on! Chief! Say something! - Chief! Please wake up! Chief! - [zombie shark snarling] Akira! [snarling] [grunting] [winces] - [grunts] - Shit, no. What should we do now? We don't have time for whining. Just try to focus right now. [thudding] [Tendo straining] - [gasps] - Hey! [zombie shark snarls] [Shizuka grunts] Here's something, I think. - It's all we have. - What are you gonna do with that? Hone in on its weakness. - [Kencho] Weakness? - [Shizuka] Inside a shark's head, it has an ultra-sensitive tool for detecting its prey. If we give it a jolt of electricity there, it'll be done for. Zombie sharks may react differently though. It's a guess, huh? Yeah, but how do we shock the bastard? Akira's got on a steel suit right now, so he can just be like a zombie shark conductor. I'm just not sure how to get it to Akira. - [Tendo grunts] - [zombie shark snarls] I got this. [strains] [zombie shark gurgling] [Kencho] Hey! Ow! Akira, look! The batteries Kencho's about to toss, you smash into the shark's nose. - Huh? Why its nose? - [Shizuka] I'll explain later. This is the only way we might beat this thing. And the suit's the key, so, Akira, only you can do this now! Okay! - [zombie shark snarls] - [Tendo grunting] Akira! - [zombie shark gurgling] - [Tendo grunts] [gasps] Look at me, asshole! [zombie shark gurgles] [footsteps approaching] Akira! - [gasps] - [Tendo] Kencho! Hurry! Kencho! Kencho! [snarls] [Tendo] Hurry! [sobbing] [snarling] [Kencho] Akira! Catch this! [grunts] - Nice pass! - [loud bang] [gasps] Ke... Kencho! [snarls] [grunting, panting] [shouting] - [snarls] - Now, die! [electricity crackling] [grunts] - [zombie shark gurgling] - [electricity crackling] - [gurgling stops] - [Tendo pants] [sighs] Kencho. Kencho! Kencho! Kencho! Don't you die! Kencho! Kencho! I'm sorry. I was just faking dead. [chuckles] [grunts, groans] - [chuckles] - [sighs] [both sigh] Are you joking? Sorry, sorry. I thought you could only play dead to fool bears, though. It won't stop a bear either, you guys. - Huh? It wouldn't? - Mmm. - Oh. - [chuckles] - [Kencho] How's your leg? - [Shizuka] Huh? Oh, something fell on me and I got stuck for a second. [Kencho] Gotcha. And you're okay? [Shizuka] Yeah. It just hurts a little. [zombies gurgling] - [survivor 1] This one will do. - [survivors chattering] You need anything? [indistinct chattering] - [survivor 2] Nice. - [survivor 3] Help me. - [groans] Help me. - Why are you in such a hurry? Relax, man. We can take our time. - [Sumire] Thank you. - [chuckles] - [Sumire's husband] Don't push yourself. - [Sumire] Mm-hmm. - Whoa. - [Sumire] All right? - Okay. - [Sumire chuckles] Hey, stop! Wait! Where are you going? I didn't say you could go! - Hey! - [people gasp] - [survivor 2] Hey, stop that. - That asshole. We're all leaving this place! So please don't try and get in our way! [laughs] Come on, man. You think weaklings like you can make it alone, huh? - [laughs] - [Sumire] It's true that we're not strong. I'm sure we can all become better to defend our baby. [Yoshida scoffs] We're leaving too. We can't work under a guy like you any longer. But guys... You used us both as shields. What kind of leader are you? A much better leader helped us all. We saw how Tendo was much more of a leader than you. - Right? - [all] Yeah! - [Yamaguchi] Yeah, damn straight. - Morons! [grunts] All right. Let's get everybody ready to go, okay? [all] Yeah. [survivors chattering] Hey! [survivor 2] Sorry, coming through. Kencho. - [Tendo] Just about ready. - Hey! - [huffing] - [Kencho] Let's go. [engine starts] Thank you so much, guys! Bye now! You take care! No bites, you got that? - Hey, Tendo. Bye now. - Take care. Yeah. [Tendo] All right. Ready to go? - Yeah. - Yeah. Tendo. Tendo! Tendo. [stammers] I was wrong, all right? I got it. Suppose I make you the leader. You'll stick around then, won't ya? [chuckles] I decided which team I'll be a part of now. [engine cranks, starts] I'm sorry. [chuckles] Right. It's been nice knowing ya. - [chuckles] - [car honks] [Kosugi] Hey, wait! Tendo! [sighs] [chuckles] [sighs] That's the end of that career, so... can a guy who's as indecisive as I am still get a job these days or what? [Kencho and Shizuka chuckle] Hold on. This is a serious issue. Akira, just try to build the life you always wanted. And have fun, no matter what. [Tendo] Hmm? So that one day, you can work on the things that only you can do. [chuckles] Shizuka-san. Besides, I thought you had a job, huh? Being a hero, isn't it? [chuckles] Kencho. Oh. How about you two add on to the list? - Mmm. Okay. - Wow, cool. Then I can start. [Tendo] Right. [scribbling] 18. BECOME A COMEDIAN AND MAKE PEOPLE REALLY LAUGH - Okay. There. - Thanks. [scribbling] [Kencho and Tendo chuckle] 19. BECOME A DOCTOR WHO SAVES MANY LIVES - There. - Okay. [chuckles] 13. BECOME A SUPERHERO THAT SAVES EVERYONE [scribbling] 20. MAKE BEING A SUPERHERO MY NEW JOB! Well, this is our list now. We're agreed? - [Shizuka] Mm-hmm. - [Tendo] Yeah. [Shizuka sighs] Yes! Well... [brake thuds] ...until we reach a hundred... [engine revs] ...let's all just give it our best! [Kosugi sighs]
