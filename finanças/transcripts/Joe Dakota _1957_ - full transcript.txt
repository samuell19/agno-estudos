Hello! Hello! Hello. Imagine my not seeing you. What kind of a town is this, anyway? It's a small town. Oh, I can see that. Where's everybody else? Or are you the only one who lives here? Everybody else is working. And they left you here to run the town. Did you want supplies? No. Wind always blow like this around here? Sometimes. Sure you won't just vanish the minute my back is turned? I'll be here, I live here. I'll be back. All right, men, pull it up again! Pull! Let her go! All right, take it up! Pull! Pull, steady, pull! Pull! Let her go, now! Pull it up again. Hold it. Cal, we got company. Hi, something I can do for you? Oh, I'm just riding by, and I noticed you were drilling an oil well. Yeah Looks interesting. Thought I'd stop and watch for awhile, if you don't mind. No, no, I guess it'll be all right. Thank you. Who is he, Cal? I don't know, just riding through, I guess. Wants to watch. You want him to keep on going, just say so. No, no, I don't think he'll get in the way. Pull it up again, now! Pull! Let her go! Look, mister, just because I said you could watch, doesn't mean you have the run of the place. This is private property, you know. Where's the fellow who lives in the shack? Nobody lives there. Where's the fellow who owns the property? I own it. If it's a job you're looking for, I'm afraid we can't use you. This is what you might call a small, private operation. And as you can see, we're quite... Oh, I see, I won't bother you. Hello, how long you fellas been diggin' this well? I don't think you got a good look at that No Trespassing sign. We could read it to him. Yeah Hey, mister. Excuse me. Let me give you a little tip, friend. People in a small town don't like strangers very much at any time, and when these people are diggin' an oil well, they don't like strangers at all. You know, I think you'd better get on your horse and ride away from this small town. You understand? Yeah. All right, take it up! Bring that drill over here! I thought you were leaving. How long do you say you've been drillin' this well? I didn't say. That shack up there. Did you build it, or was that here before? I don't think that's any of your business. What about this pool of oil? What about it? Well, it doesn't look like you've hit oil yet, so it must have been here before. You're just full of questions, aren't you? Made it pretty simple for you to figure out where to put this well down. Aw, you fellas shouldn't have done that. Well, you seem to be having a problem about our oil pool. Yeah, we wanted you to get to the bottom of it. See you boys around. Ho, there. Now, don't try to be funny. It's me. Who is he, Cal? I don't know. From the questions he was asking about the oil well, my guess is he's a wildcatter. Isn't that a pretty rough way to treat him, Cal? Best thing to do is get rid of him, Frank. I know these wildcatters. Once they smell oil and start asking questions, they try to figure out a way to cut themselves in. Myrna, you don't suppose that Jody told him what we were doing when he came through town? No, she wouldn't talk to a stranger, Dad. She hardly talks to us any more. Maybe she did, but don't worry about it. I don't think he'll be back. All right, boys, get the drill. If I'd known where you were going, I could've told you they don't like visitors. Thanks. Thanks a lot. This your store? My father's. If I had some coal oil, I could clean some of this stuff off. Got any money? This is money. It is? Will be, after I clean it up some. It's not gonna help your clothes much. I think you need some new ones. I think you're right, you find my size? I'm pretty dirty to come inside. Shirt large, pants small. Ahh, better make the pants medium, socks large. Sure could use a bath. There's a public bath upstairs, you could use that. You know it sure is a funny thing. What is? Oh, you're being so friendly and so helpful. Look at the way they treated me. How come you're so nice? I'm not as interested in that oil well as they are. That's good. Neither am I. You're not? Then why'd you go out there? Came here to see the old man. The Indian. Joe Dakota? Who? The Indian. What'd you call him? Joe Dakota. You came out here to see a man, and don't even know his name? That's nothin', I don't know your name, either. Jody Weaver. Jody? Well, Jody, I know that's Joe's shack out there, but one of the men told me it's his property. And nobody lived there at all. Is that right? Farm used to belong to Joe Dakota, but he doesn't live there anymore. Hey, where you goin'? Hey, Jody, wait a minute! Hey, Jody, you can't leave me out here like this! What about my bath? ♫ There are fools who must always wander ♫ And go wherever the winds have blown ♫ I heard the call, and I rode out yonder ♫ So far from my home in San Antone ♫ I want a love so sweet and tender ♫ The dearest love I'll ever know ♫ Hey! ♫ In my heart she'll bloom forever ♫ Hey, mister! ♫ So far far from San Antone ♫ Hey! Hey! Get over, Blackie, get over, get over, come on. Get over there, boy, get over there. Hi! What do you think you're doing? Taking a bath. You shouldn't be taking it in there. You shouldn't have locked me out! It's the only place in town that was open. You'd better get out of there. What'd you run away for? You're in trouble now. What in blazes is he doing? That man, taking a bath! Jody, get away from that window! Rosa, take Maddie inside, right away. That fella's got a lot of gall. Gotta get him outa there. Thing like that could give this town a bad name. Come on, Sis, that's nothing for you to be looking at. Scandalous! Well, you don't have to keep looking, Ethel. Myrna, take the women and kids into the store. Keep 'em off the street. We'll handle this. I guess maybe I'd better explain this, huh? Go ahead. Make it good. Well, to be truthful, I, I didn't expect you to get back so soon. And, took me a lot longer to get this stuff off than it did for you to get it on me. That's no reason for makin' a public bath out of our water trough. It is a little more public than I figured, at that. You oughta be thrown in jail. If you jail him, you gotta feed him. Horse whippin's cheaper. I thought we made it clear before that you're not welcome here. Oh, you made that clear enough. May need a little help. Just what kind of help you think you'd get from us? Well, now the way I see it, we got two choices. We can wait here until it gets dark, or you fellas can make a tighter circle and I can get up outa here. Would you please throw me the towel off my saddle bag? I think you've stalled around long enough. Money for the new clothes is over there on the bench. How'd you get the stuff, anyway? Just go in my store and take it? Nope. Your lovely daughter got them for me. You mean my Jody was out here when you... No, of course not. We were over there, talking about the Indian. Joe Dakota. She ran inside and locked the door. Hold it. I'm afraid I got the water pretty soapy. Are you gonna get on that horse, or are we gonna make other plans for you? I don't suppose any of you boys like to tell me where the old man went, would you? Nope, I didn't think you would. I don't think we'll be bothered with him coming around here again. He sure don't discourage easy, I'll say that for him. I don't feel right about it, Cal. I think we handled that fella all wrong. Jim, you worry too much. You know, if you go on like this, you won't be able to shave yourself, let alone your customers. I don't know, Cal. Rosa and me's been talking. It seemed to us our town is a'changed. It used to be a nice, friendly place, but no more. Used to be a friendly people, open, kind. We're still the same people. Ah, but we're not the same people. Look at what we do to that man today. And look at what we do to Cal. Just a little while ago. When he's coming, we say, come in. Sit down, have a glass of wine. We shake his hand, we listen to his talkin' nice and friendly-like. That's because you were friendly. And because you did listen to me when I told you about the oil on Dakota's farm, we're all partners in a venture that will make us rich. That's why we have to be careful about outsiders. You know, no other stranger would walk in and give you an oil well. He'd only trying to take it away from you. But that is not the reason we throw this fellow out today. It's because we're scared. We're scared somebody's gonna find out the truth about what we do. We so scared, we, we don't even wanna talk to each other. We're not scared of that, Mark. We only did what we had to do. I don't think any of us should be ashamed of it. We did it to keep this a good town, a friendly town. But it's nobody else's business. And we have to see that it stays that way. Forget it, Mark, you'll have plenty of time to be friendly when that well comes in. When we get our hands on some of that money. That's the day I'm waiting for! I might even buy me a shave! You have to talk to my assistant. Well, even without help, Jim, you're the unbusiest man in town. How much longer we gonna have to wait? Cal says it could come in any time. Mark, let's have round of drinks on me. I didn't realize it was so soon. Just like I've been telling Bertha. Little farmers like me ain't gonna get rich no matter how many times we pick up and move on. But this time, I think we're located to stay. It's gonna be real nice for Sis, too. Ethel never was pretty enough to catch herself a husband. She deserves something outa life. I think maybe I talk too much. Come on, bring your glasses, wine is on the house. Come on. You go on, I'll be over in a minute. How do you do, honey? I saw you outside a minute ago. Did you go for a walk today? Jody, wouldn't you feel better if you came out to the well once in awhile? I'd stay here. Jody, this is ridiculous, you can't go on not talking to me. What's that? I knew he'd come back. What'd you say? I knew he'd come back. He told you this? No, he didn't tell me, I just knew. Well, he's gonna be sorry he did. You stay here. Sure is quite a town. It's always empty, except for one pretty girl. You're a different pretty girl. Where's Jody? Never mind about my sister. If you think this town is empty, you're in for an unpleasant surprise. Wait a minute, I'll go with you. Cal, Cal, he's back! Glass of wine, please. Wait a minute, Mark. Thank you. I don't think he'll be around long enough to drink that. Maybe I won't, at that. You answer a couple of simple questions for me, maybe I can leave you for good. Let's hear the questions. All right, where's the Indian? The old man, you know, as Jody put it. The Indian doesn't live here any more. You mean, he left town? Yeah, he left. When did he leave? Oh, two weeks ago, maybe, maybe more. Where'd he go? He didn't say. Do you know where I can find him? No. Does anyone know where I can find him? No. Well, looks like I'll just have to stick around for awhile. For what? Maybe I like it here. It's a pretty little town. Nice people, friendly. Why don't all you folks have a drink with me? Why not? Let's have drink with him. You remember what Mark told us last night? Let's show him how friendly we really are. Where? Why don't you and Adam see if our friend would like to join your club? Sure, Cal. That's a fine idea. Of course, it's a pretty exclusive club. Yeah, but we're always lookin' for new members. And if you plan to stay around here, you'd better join, it's the only club in town. Sounds interesting. Who's in your club? Just us. Me and Aaron. What do you do? Oh, we drink, mostly. Yeah, drinking club. I'm in favor of that. Only we play a little game, first. To see who buys the drinks. But I already offered to buy. No, that'd spoil all the fun. And it's against the rules. I figured there'd be rules. It's real easy, it goes like this. First, I try to knock Adam off his stool. But I only get one punch. That's a rule. And I can't hang onto nothing with my hands. That's a rule. If Adam falls off, he's gotta buy. But I didn't, so now it's my turn to try to knock Aaron offa his stool. But neither one of you fell off. Yeah, that's a tie. So we keep on going 'til somebody wins. I understand why you have a limited membership. Well, it's a small town. We don't get visitors very often. Well, I don't join many clubs. When a visitor does come to town, he's too busy trespassin'. Or pokin' his nose into somebody else's business. Or takin' baths. Or maybe he's just yella. Yeah. Couldn't I just buy a round of drinks for the house, and let it go at that? Not without joining the club. No, we couldn't drink with you, if you're yella. Well, sounds like a harmless little game. I'll join your club. Please, mister, why don't you just leave town, huh? What do we do first? First, we have the initiation. You just turn around and face Adam. My younger brother's still a growin' boy. Probably doesn't have his full strength yet. I thought he did pretty good for a young fella. My turn, now? Looks like it. Yes, it is. Ready? Yeah. We're ready. Who's first? I guess I am. Looks like you fellas buy. You boys really like to fight, don't you. Yeah, we sure do. And we get awful tired of fightin' each other. That was a very impressive demonstration. Thanks. But it doesn't mean a thing. There isn't any place for you to stay in Arborville. And that includes the street. Well, don't worry about me. I own a little piece of property around here. It's got a shack on it. I'll spend tonight at my place. Wait a minute, mister. It's about time you stopped bluffing. We know every piece of land in this area, and who owns it. Which piece do you claim is yours? You're drilling an oil well on it. You're getting unfunnier by the minute. Who do you think you are? Thought you'd never ask me. The name is Joe Dakota. That's right. And the Recorder's Office, County Seat, shows clearly that the property is registered in my name. Since I don't remember selling it to anyone, I figure it still belongs to me. You're wrong, mister, that's my land, the old Indian sold it to me. Frank, get my envelope outa your safe. Sure, Cal, we can put a stop to this mighty quick. Joe Dakota? How could his name be Joe Dakota? Could be the old man's son. No, he couldn't, he's not an Indian. Could be a half-breed. He looks enough like an Indian to be a half-breed. Sure fights like a savage. Here you are, Cal. This paper's worthless. Worthless, just because I haven't had time to get it recorded doesn't mean a thing. It's legal here as it would be at the County Seat. Except that the Indian didn't make this mark. I say he did. I doubt if he's ever seen it. He saw it and he made the mark. Then there's only one way to settle this. Let's get him. Bring him back here, find out from him. We told you, the old Indian is gone. That's your problem. And you can forget about any more drilling out there until we get this thing settled. I told you, we don't know where he went. Well, then we'll just have to wait until you find out. Or until one of you... Remembers. Frank, you better put this back in the safe. I wonder what Cal's gonna do about this. What does it mean, what is he trying to do? Oh, he's just some wildcatter trying to bluff his way in. I had him spotted right the first time. How can we be sure he's bluffing, Cal? That's right, he seems to know more about this Indian than a stranger should. Look, I didn't say he wasn't smart, he's proved that. With one quick trip to the County Seat, he gets just enough information to make it sound like he knows more than he really does. Maybe we should ask him to prove he's Joe Dakota. My guess is, that he can do it. And a lot easier than we can prove that he wasn't. Right now. You think he's telling the truth? No, of course not. But you can be sure that he took the trouble to get some kind of evidence, just in case we did ask for it. Could have been anything with Joe Dakota's name on it. Phony letter or something. I don't know, Cal, he seemed awful sure of himself. Wait a minute, Jim, what are you getting at? Well, nothing, Cal, I was just thinking that maybe. Thinkin' what, that he's right? Because if you are, you know what that means. Means you think that I'm wrong. He as much as said that I stole that land from the Indian. Is that what you believe? Oh no, Cal, no! Nobody thinks that, Cal. Nobody here believes anything that fella told us. We all know about the paper. Jim, you saw it go into the safe. Yeah, I did. Bud, you were here in the store. Yeah, I remember. Myrna opened the safe, I put the paper in, and locked it. And we all know when it was done. Nobody doubts you, Cal, not after what you've done for us. For all of us. I know, Myrna, I know. But that's not what concerns me. Well, what is it, then? Well, it's something I should have thought of before. There is a chance the Indian sold me a piece of land that he didn't really own. Something he had no right to sell. You think such a thing is possible? Well, the well this close to coming in, and him sitting out there. We need to find out. I'm going to County Seat. I'm scared, Cal, I'm afraid it's all gonna fall apart. I couldn't stand that. I wanna walk down a street that isn't dirty, where everybody's different, not always the same. It means a lot to me, too, honey. That surface oil pot, as shallow as it is, will be the stake to get us started on the next one, and the one after that, I don't wanna lose that stake. I don't wanna lose you. You won't lose me. I used to pray that somebody like you would come here. I was so grateful when you did, even before I knew you. Ever since you've been here, it's been wonderful and exciting. I don't want anything to happen to our plans, Cal. Nothing is gonna happen, Myrna. If I find that the Indian really owned that land, we'll have very little trouble with the new Joe Dakota. Supposing you find something else? The worst that I can find out is that this fellow really owns the land. I figure that if he does, he's the only one who knows it. Hold it, right there. And I don't think you'll have any need for that rifle. I didn't come out here for any trouble, but I think you and I had better have a little talk. What for? Nothing to talk about unless you found the Indian. You know, when you first came into town, I had a feeling that I've seen you someplace before? I don't think so. Oh, I spent a good many years around the oil fields. Maybe it was Pico Canyon I saw you. Is that where you're from? Nope. Well, sooner or later, every wildcatter winds up at Newhall. Is that so? Well, it's the only oil refinery in the state, isn't it? Newhall you say? Yeah. Never heard of it. Well, you are an oilman, aren't you? You know what I think? I think you ask an awful lot of questions for a man who says that I am bluffing. Hold it. Well, now just a minute, friend. I was trying to be nice to you. I know we were a little rough on you, and I'm sorry for that. I'm even willing to overlook the fact that you're trespassing until we get this thing settled. Well, as I understand it, possession is nine points of the law. And as you can see, I'm in possession of this place. So until somebody changes that, one way or another, it looks to me like you're trespassing. Let me give you a friendly tip. People in a small town don't like strangers prowling around their places at night. So why don't you just climb on your horse and ride away from this place? Are you listening, Jody? Sure. This is important, I don't want you to talk to him again. I think he's nice. Well he's not nice. If he's that Indian's son or any relation at all, it's not safe for you to get near him, and you know why. I wish you'd stop talking about it. Well, I'm only doing it for your own good. Cal says he's dangerous. Cal's afraid of him. Cal's not afraid of anybody. He's not? No, he's not. Neither am I. All right, keep your shirt on. All right. Come in. Ask for a shave, I guess. Must be 1 o'clock in the morning. Yep, a shave. You said, shave? Yeah, cash customer. That'll be something different, too. Time I get a sack of potatoes. Maybe a chicken. I'll have to use cold water. That's fine. What's your name? Jim. What's your last name? Jim Baldwin. Good to know you, Jim. I guess you know my name. Yes, yes I do. Jim. Huh? This fella Cal, lived around here for a long time? Oh, Cal Moore? No, not as long as the rest of us have. He seems kind of like one of us, now, I guess. You people are pretty lucky to have an oil expert here, just when you found out that there was oil here, weren't you? Yeah, I guess we were. Only he said he wasn't looking for oil, when he came. I thought wildcatters were always looking for oil. That's what I figured, too. Only according to him, he's just looking for a nice piece of farming land. Said he was through with oil, wanted to settle down. That's why he wanted to buy the Indian's place, farming? Yeah, that's what I figure, I guess. Jim, let's talk about the Indian. He didn't really wanna sell his farm. Isn't that right, Jim? And when he couldn't persuade him to sell his place, he tried to force him into it, even threaten him. He ain't gonna get me talking about that, no sirree. Jim? Jim? Well, hello. I thought I might be having all kinds of visitors out here. I sure didn't expect you. Not this time of night. It's almost morning. I had to come out, while everybody was asleep, or I wouldn't get a chance to talk to you at all. Come in. Well, what'll we talk about? I wanna know who you are. Thought you weren't interested in the oil. I'm not, but there can be other reasons. Well, as I said, my name is Joe Dakota. That's not true. Isn't it? And you're not his son, like they say in town. Joe Dakota didn't have a son. How do you know that? He told me. I used to come out here to see him, lots of times. He'd talk, he'd show me how to make things or would tell me stories about when he was a scout for the cavalry. Sounds like you knew him pretty well. I did, he was my friend. If you came here just to steal his land, why did you have to steal his name? I didn't steal his name. As a matter of fact, he borrowed mine. You're making that up. You didn't even know his name until I told you what it was. I just didn't know he was using it. I came up here because the old man sent me a telegram asking me for help. He sent for you? He was my friend, too, that's why I came. You came too late, he's dead. I was afraid that might be it. Do you know who killed him? Everyone. They hanged him. Hanged him. Why? Because he wouldn't sell his farm? What kind of a town is this? They hanged him for what he did to me. For what he did to you? I came out here one night, and Joe was drunk. He grabbed me, tore my clothes, and hit me, and I got away from him and ran off. When they heard what he tried to do, they came out here and got him, and hanged him. Who sent you out here to tell me this fantastic story? It's not a fantastic story. It's the truth. I don't believe you. He couldn't have done a thing like that, drunk or sober. That's what makes it so hard to understand. Maybe it was my fault. I don't believe that, either. Your story just doesn't make sense. It didn't take an expert to figure out there was oil on this land. Almost anyone who saw that surface pool out there could make a pretty good guess. Well, somebody made that guess. Now there's an oil well here. And the Indian is dead and the whole town is trying to hide behind a phony piece of paper. But Cal put that paper in my father's safe two weeks before the hanging. Then why was the old man still here? Cal said he could stay until he was ready to take possession. They gave you all the answers, didn't they. Nobody told me what to say. I'm telling you the truth. Well, go back, and tell them it didn't work. I'm sorry that's the reason you came out here. I'll tell you the real reason. I came out here because I thought you were nice. And because I hoped what they were saying about you wasn't the truth. That won't work either, Jody. You're a lovely-looking girl. I'm sorry you're not as honest as you look. I hate you. What are you doing? Getting dressed. Jody, you've been crying again. Wait for me, honey, let's have breakfast together, and we can talk. I don't want any breakfast. Dad, I think you'd better have a talk with Jody. She was crying this morning, and it looks like it's starting all over again. Myrna, I don't know what to say to her. Well, you'll have to say something. She won't even talk to me. Where is she? Out front. Hello, Frank, kind of nice to have a day off from the oil well at that, isn't it? Gives us all a chance to catch up on things. Myrna's inside. Hello, folks. Oh, Frank! Has anybody seen him yet, today? Who? Him, you know. No, not a sign. If I don't watch that boy, he'll hand his hand in your candy jar. Don't you worry, we'll count the pieces. Missed you at breakfast this morning, Jody. I wasn't hungry. Honey, I hate to see you get like this again. You were so much better. Was I? I suppose there's that fella coming into town, asking about the Indian, made you start thinking about it again. Is that it? Something like that. I know it's no use to say, don't think about it. But at least we made sure nothing like that will ever happen here again. Did the oil well have anything to do with it, Dad? What do you mean by that? Did you hang Joe Dakota to get the oil on his farm? Jody, that's a terrible thing to say. You shouldn't even have thoughts like that. What kind of people do you think we are? That's what I'd like to know. Jody, I don't think there's one person that knew there was oil on that farm the night Joe Dakota was hanged. I didn't know it. The two things just aren't connected at all. Where'd you ever get such an idea? From him, that's what he said. You mean you talked to him again? I went out there this morning. Jody, that was dangerous and stupid. Don't you care what happens to you? I had to talk to him. Then you told him what happened to the Indian. Yes. I just don't understand you. What made you do a thing like that? I guess because I had to talk to somebody about what happened, because I feel like it's my fault he died. And if he's related to him, or even just a friend, I could try to explain. Because it just didn't seem right that he was looking for Joe Dakota, and nobody was gonna tell him he was dead. You're the last person to go telling a story like that to a stranger. If there's nothing wrong, I don't see why it makes any difference. You have a responsibility, Jody, to me, and to the others. Because of what we had to do. I didn't ask you to do it. I didn't want him to be killed. Neither did anyone else. Dakota had to be punished. We did it because it was our job. I don't know what I'm gonna say to the others. They were helping me protect my family. And it turns out, my family isn't very grateful. Jody, go to your room. Stay there 'til I tell you to come out. What's he trying to do? I don't know. Doesn't have to mean anything. Maybe he was just fishing, hoping we'd give something away. Did you see the cross hanging from the saddle? I'm a'wonder what he's gonna do with that? He knows, all right, he's goin' out to mark the grave, that's where he's goin'. Yeah, it looks like that's where he's goin'. We can find out, easy enough. I know who you are. You do? That's a cavalry pistol belt, isn't it? Yes. I should have known before. But I thought you were lying about your name. So I didn't believe anything you said. Well, that makes us even, I didn't believe you, either. There was only one person Joe Dakota would have asked for help. Only one man he ever called his friend. That's who you are, isn't it. His captain. That's right, Jody. I wonder why he never said your name. Probably because he was using it, himself. But why? Well, he put my name on his land deed. The only reason I can figure is because my name is the only one he knew how to write. I didn't think he could write at all. He couldn't, really. But he could write, Joe Dakota. I taught him. Then that's how you knew Cal's paper was no good. That's why the story you told me didn't make sense. But now that I know who you are, you've just got to believe me. Well, that's a pretty big order, Jody. Either they hanged the old man to get the oil for themselves, or... They didn't even know the oil was there. Then for some reason, they did it to cover up for Cal. No, they did it for me. Well, that's the part I can't believe. I didn't make up the story, it's true. You have to believe me. Maybe there's a way I can believe you and not believe your story. What do you mean? It's like that paper of Cal's. You and I know that it's no good. But as long as the people believe in it, they'll believe anything he tells them. And what can I do to convince you I'm telling the truth. Tell me what happened that night, Jody, everything. Little details, anything that comes into your mind. All right. Was it dark here? Very dark. Well, where did it happen? Right outside, there. My father didn't like for me to go out to see Joe after dark, sometimes I did anyway. When I was almost to the door, somebody grabbed me. I couldn't see him at first. He held me so tightly, I couldn't even turn my head. I remember his breath was hot on my neck. I could smell the wine he'd been drinking. And I remember his face was rough against my cheek. When I fought to get away, he hit me so hard that everything went black. When I came to, I saw Joe standing there. I could see him clearly. It was Joe Dakota, bending over me, reaching out for me with his hands. Jody, you said that his face was rough against your cheek. What did you mean? It hurt. Scratched. His whiskers, I guess. His whiskers, Jody? Joe, when he was bending down, reaching out for me, he was only trying to help me. Wasn't he. Yeah. Hey, that's Cal. What's the matter? He found out about the Indian. He hung this on our sign. Who told him? Nobody. We don't even see him until he come in town with the rope. Well, somebody must have told him! Jody, Jody did it. Jody, why would she do that? Some strange reason of her own. Where is she? She's in her room. Tom, I'm beginning to wonder if something didn't go wrong and Cal isn't telling us about it. So am I, he sure seems awful worried about something. Cal, nobody likes what's been happening here today. Oh, you mean about the noose? Not only that, he's make a wooden cross and put it on the Indian's grave. Today he ride down the middle of town, with a cross and a rope hanging from his saddle for everybody to see. Just like he's trying to be the conscience for the whole town. Conscience, we've got nothing to feel guilty about. You said that yourself, Frank. I know I said it, Cal. I hope we haven't... You hope! Say, what's the matter with all of you people? A man comes riding in, goes through a lot of hocus pocus about a cross and a noose, you all start to fall apart. Well, you know he did it just to scare you. He's not interested about the Indian being dead, or how he died. He's interested in but one thing, that oil well. I only wish we could believe that, Cal. We can! That paper that we have is just as good as gold. The old Indian really owned that land. The clerk at the Recorder's office remembered him. We can prove it, any time we have to. Now, wait a minute. Now, you all listen to me. That's my land, but your money is invested in it. Our entire futures are tied up in that oil well. That's what he's trying to take away from you. You gonna let him? Well, what are you waiting for? Cal's found proof of our rights! He's only asking us to stand up for what's ours. You can't let him down, now, you can't let yourselves down. We'll hook up the wagons. This time, we'll run him out for good! Rosa, I'll stay here with the children! Good! If it weren't for me, he'd still be alive. Jody, what we've just discovered proves that it wasn't your fault. You mustn't blame yourself, ever. The well! Ho, how down, ho there. We gotta get out there and stop that gusher! What about him? First we gotta cap that oil well. We'll take care of him later, let's go. Right! Joe, what are you gonna do? Have a little talk. Don't go out there, Cal may have a gun, he'll shoot you. I don't think he will. Joe. You stay inside. Myrna, Myrna! You stay with the women! Can he stop us, Cal? Don't worry about him. Go ahead, get the plugs and the sledges! He's coming down, Cal. That's far enough. You wouldn't shoot anybody, Cal. You get other people to do your killing for you, like you did with the old Indian. I figure any man who'd use a girl to frame an old man hasn't got too much daylight courage. You had to get rid of the old Indian by having a whole town hang him for something he didn't do, then you're not going to shoot me. You wouldn't shoot anybody, not in front of witnesses. Not when there's proof that the old man didn't sign legal papers with an X, and you found that out at the Recorder's Office, didn't you. You're wasting our time, mister. Nobody believes that story. Everyone here knows what happened to the Indian, and why. No, you don't, Dad. Jody! I know something the proves we're all wrong. What you been telling this girl? Jody, don't talk any more. I thought about it all over again, step by step. Don't pay any attention to her, he's told her what to say! I remember a man's hot breath on my neck. I could smell the wine he'd been drinking. And I remember his whiskers scratching my cheek. Well, Mr. Weaver, do I have to explain to you what Jody just told you? The old man, like most Indians, didn't have beard. Which just goes to show that there was somebody else out there that night, too, someone who had a beard, whose whiskers scratched Jody's face. Someone who got there long enough ahead of her to get the old man drunk. Who was already back in town waiting for her to come in to make sure that you'd hang him. You're a little liar. Someone who had to get rid of the Indian because he had a forged document planted in Frank Weaver's safe. You don't believe that fantastic story, do you? I don't know what to think, Cal. I'm beginning to wonder. Think, what's there to think about? I gave you the oil well, money, look at it going to waste! Didn't I give you... A murder? He's just an old Indian. Nobody's hurt, the girl's all right, what's an Indian against an oil well. All right, mister, let me have your gun. I'll show you who's a coward, and I'll show you something about killing, too, if I have to! Adam, Aaron, pick up that plug! Sam, Tom, give 'em a hand! This is my oil well, and we're gonna cap it. Mark, get the sledges. And Frank, you're gonna help, too. Don't think I won't use this gun. Remember, it's all I got left, now, move! I said, move! Come on, come on, get it in there! Come on, hurry up, lift it higher, higher! Ready, easy, Tom! Get him, Joe Dakota, get him! Stick him in the oil, Joe, stick him in the oil! Get your hand off that wrench, Cal! No wrenches, that's a rule! This time we handle it legal, right, Frank! Yeah, we'll turn him over to the county. Look, look! Get out of here, up on the hill! I had to do it. Now maybe we have our friendly town back again. If God will forgive us for what we have done. Come down. Adam, don't you ever talk me into an oil deal again. That's a new rule. Joe Dakota, we can't undo what's already been done. It's not really a bad town. And we're not bad people. I know that, Mr. Weaver. I kind of like this town, too. Maybe that's one of the reasons I'm coming back. He borrowed my name, Jody. This is just to let him know, it's all right.
