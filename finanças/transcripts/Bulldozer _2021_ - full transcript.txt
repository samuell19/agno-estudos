We targeted a drug trafficker working with a paramilitary group in Texas. He had a girlfriend with a case pending. 50 kilos of Bolivian cream. We knew it wasn't hers. Oh, he had her thinking she would bust the case, but, she knew she was looking at a decade in dry storage, so... I found her in two days by tracking his phone. Then I found her irresistible. They call it killing two birds with one stone, but um, I call it de-railing my fucking life. I was making her promises I was actually going to keep. A bullet for me. A fucking bullet meant for me. Hey. Don't think they're gonna be hiring anybody for a while. That was nice last night. I really enjoyed that. I love the food there. But we shouldn't have spent that much money. Yeah, we have to do that more often. I mean, we don't get out enough together. All work, no play, right? You have to run them, you know. - Huh? - See? You forgot what you said, when we first got together. No, I didn't forget. Okay, then tell me. "A beautiful woman is like a Ferrari. You can't worry about where you park it, or you're never really gonna enjoy it. They're like racehorses. If you don't take 'em out and run 'em, they get bored." Um, can I be honest with you? Oh-oh. No, I'd rather you just lie to me. Oh, my god, I can't talk to you because you're gonna get mad. Try me. How would you feel if I went home for a while? I miss my family. I thought you said you were gonna be honest? I am! You don't have to ask me to go see your family. I know what this is. This is... It's the first step in you leaving me. I didn't say that. You didn't have to. Look, I know that things have not lived up to expectations. You know, when we first got together, I had money to burn and I did, but that does not last for anybody, Tina. I mean, everybody we know is going through hard times right now, they're all under water. Look, I have been good to you. I've been patient with you and I've been loyal to you. As a matter of fact, I moved to this desert to be with you. This place has no culture, no class, no future for me. I mean, us. There she is. Okay, okay. Mostly me. Now you're telling the truth. I don't apologize. I wanna go somewhere where people have roots or substance. That's not too much to ask. I have responsibilities here. Responsibilities? You're a grease monkey, and you smell like oil and gas. Tina. Stay. You could do something else. You could be so much more, baby. Look, I'll think about it. It's not like I don't wanna do something else either, okay? Don't think. Let's just do it. If you really love me. Stay up and wait for me. Hurry. I intercepted his text to you. Yeah, just be there early, and I'll find you through your phone. Don't worry. You won't be alone. - I'll be right there, okay? - Okay. Don't leave me hanging. Okay. Is everything good? Yeah. What time are we gonna meet to pick up the rest? We gotta go soon. Do they have the same guys working all the time? - No, it's a big operation. - Okay, good. What do you think? All the cops are busy with all that rioting and shit. They're thinned out but I have a spot, quiet, by the lake. - That's far. - Nah, it's perfect. It's industrial. All this shit's closed down. How much money? I don't know. Why are you whispering? I don't know. Hey, I'm seeing jobs for drivers. Trucks? Not 18-wheelers, right? You could drive a truck. I can't drive those kind of trucks. Excuses. Hey, do you think I like this? Okay, so then what're you doing? What're you doing to fix this? I'm selling my business? Your business? I'm getting rid of the fucking business, Tina, okay? You don't have to curse, you know. I'm selling my equipment, okay? I am dumping a lease I'm responsible for. And then, yeah, I'm gonna have to go work for somebody else. Okay, so make it happen. I'll be right there, okay? All right. I'm making this recording today, July 22nd. I'm in Las Vegas. In case I get killed or disappear, I'm intercepting payment from the Riva cartel to the LEO group. With the money I intercept, I'll make the payment for the weapons promised to the Verde playa cartel. Paul, Paul, wait a second. You're telling me this guy can just... Wait, I've got over $2,000 just in parts. That's not even counting labor. And he come in and just this car and drive away? I'm the one that should be doing bankruptcy. You know what? Goodbye. Hello, I need money. - Today? - Yeah, like right now! I have to pay bills, you know. Okay, I'll get my magic wand. I'll make some money for us, okay? Yeah, do that. Hey, what're you doin'? Makeup. Yeah? Where are you goin'? Why? - "Why?" - Yeah, why? Because that's what people say when they're together. Oh, my god, why are you trying to start shit with me? You know what? Forget about it, okay? So annoying. I'm gonna buy a boat. 30-footer, twin engines, something with a cabin. - We're in the desert. - Lake, stupid. Get the kids off the video games and get in the water. That's good. You don't have to worry about nothing on a lake. You probably don't even have to use the anchor. I'm tired of this delivery boy shit. I wanna make some real money. What do you wanna do? Invest? I wanna put a few kilos out on the street. Do you think they're cool with that? They're getting a police escort. This is a good fuckin' deal for them. Police say protestors sent rocks, bottles and explosives raining down on them. They responded with force of their own in the form of flash grenades and pepper spray. Police say that there were at least 75 arrests as the riots continued until dawn. There were 21 police officers injured. No count on how many protestors were hurt. He's gonna sell my equipment. He put a lock on the place. I needed to sell that stuff. I'm counting on that money to pay my own bills. Do me a favor. Let me borrow your truck. Yeah, sure. You wanna get your shit? I'll actually go out there and help you. Ah. I could do it. I'm just gonna cut his chain off. I fuckin' hate this guy. He can't give you a break with all that's going on? What a fuckin' dick! We gotta get a side hustle. I'm burning through my savings. I'm way past that, man. And let me tell you, Tina couldn't be nicer about it. Really? No, not really. Not at all. What happened? Nothin'. I just gotta, you know, pick up some stuff. What is that, a riddle? What does that mean? I'm working on it. You're getting mad at me? Didn't I tell you you could sell the company when you could? Well, I couldn't, okay? I couldn't sell the business. Of course you couldn't sell it, 'cause you don't own the building, you don't own anything. And you never will. Oh, my god. Hey, what's up, guys? You guys got the number? Yeah. Okay, you're gonna go in there, pay them, collect the product and just get the hell outta there. Cool? Copy that. Can we talk about investing? You guys wanna be managers instead of laborers? I mean, you guys are just starting out with us. We just don't think we should take a backseat to anyone in this shit. Listen, 'cause we don't need you guys. You're only here because it's convenient for us. No disrespect, my friend. We just think we have a little more to offer than your regular fuckin' transportation. Okay, listen. Just go in there and make this deal go nice and smooth, and we'll talk about expansion, later. - Capice? - That's all we're askin'. We'll see you in a couple of hours. All right, guys. It's a lot of money. What would you do? You mean after the party? Life'd sure get sleepless. I'd do a lot better than that screw. Yeah well, that screw points his finger, your ass is dead. I'll blow a fuckin' tunnel through that guy. That's them. Should I get out? Man, they should get in our car. Fuck it. You wanna get in? What's up, guys? What's up? - You guys wanna do this here? - Yeah, this is fine. Pop the trunk. Let me grab my bag. He's a cop. You sure? I don't like the way this feels. Steady, man. Steady. Listen, just know, and be ready to drive hard, if I end up shootin'. I ain't lyin' down. Get your fuckin' hands up! Hey! Get the hands up! - Gus! - Hey, shut up! Let's go! Put your hands up! Get your hands up! Get your hands up! Let's go! You and your friends are going to jail. These guys aren't with me. Shut up! Move! Move! Let's go! Let's go! You guys are going to jail! Yo, what the fuck? - Get your fuckin' hands up! - What? Oh, shit! How much is there? A lot. Help me sell it, you can have half. Man, I don't even know what it cost. I don't, either. Well, Google? Let me think. Let me think. I mean, between the two of us, there's gotta be somebody we know. Man, somebody's gonna be looking for it. What was I gonna do, not take it? Man, you should've booked. You should've ran. Just take the money and go. I got the dope. We gotta try to sell it. That's money, man. You see the bag? You see the bag I left? What is this? "What is this", with an attitude? Come on, it's money. Do you see how much money there is? You think because you put a bag of money on the bed you think you can talk to me this way? Did you see how much money there is? Well, where did you get this money? I told you. I sold the shop. Okay, so do you see me wearing a clown suit? Listen, some guys were doing a drug deal in front of the shop, I found the money. What did you do? They're going to come looking for it. It's your shop. They're gonna come here, you idiot! - Hey, watch your mouth. - Watch my mouth? You're no hero here. You just put us all in danger. What should I do, Tina? Should I just leave the money? Exactly, and call the police like a normal person. You're not gonna get away with this, you know. We're getting away with this, okay? You start packing and quit making this harder. Okay, so what are you gonna do? I just gotta go somewhere and just drop something off. What? I got some tools I gotta drop off. No, you're not. You're lying. I got the drugs too, okay? I gotta get rid of 'em. Oh! So now you're a drug dealer? Would you stop, okay? Stop! You're supposed to be with me, not against me. - Guess what. - What? He's done. He's going straight, he's gonna disappear, but I have his money. You have the money? Fuck him. I hate quitters. "Rehabilitation, redemption, serving time." They pump it in your head like a fucking mantra. You're the hero, the good side. They wanna make you into the honorable one. I have the keys, the title, the power to change. Nah, I went behind that curtain. I saw what was there. The Wizard is a politician who never took a punch in the fuckin' mouth. All I want is revenge. Change your ways? Live the straight and narrow? Fuck You. You took away my smile. The only thing I want now is your virtue on a plate. What if she's right? What if they do come looking for us? How would they? Gus can't say nothin'. He really shot at you? He thought I was one of them. He came out there with a head of steam, my man. He's got a big gun. They're all big when the barrel's pointed at you. For sure. Oh, my god. They killed that old man. Look, I was just feet away. There was bullets flying everywhere. I cannot believe I didn't get hit with anything. Man, listen. It's not as easy as you think. You'd think that these drug dealer types would know what the fuck they're doin', right? Yeah, most of the time, these fucking guys, they get their guns out, they shit their fuckin' pants, man. They're just sprayin' away and don't hit shit. Where is this from? - Columbia? - Columbia? It's good shit! You've seen these before? The last time I seen this shit, a bunch of guys ended up dead. - What're you talkin' about? - Somebody didn't pay on time? Look, you're dealin' with big boys. You can't buy one or two. You at least have to purchase 50. Who do you know? I don't know anyone. Look, I'm having a blowout sale. You got a buyer, I'll split it with you. But it's gotta be tonight. First you have to rewrap these, and even then, I don't know if I wanna touch 'em. Look, man, we'll rewrap 'em. Let's get this money. Listen, I found these. I don't do this shit. "Found"? Yeah, he did. He didn't burn anyone. Shit just fell into his lap. Yo, check this out. Steal a car, put these in the trunk, tell me where you parked it and I will try. Cool. That's all I can ask for. Yo, did you bring somebody else? No. You have to, you... - I know. - Do you? Yeah. I can't hesitate like that. Yeah, 'cause if you do, you'll sit there and watch yourself get shot. What the fuck was with the masks? The masks? They're smart. There's cameras everywhere. Hello? You're not a very good shot. Well, maybe you're the lucky one. That wasn't me. I was just watching. You're the lucky ones. Look, the dope, the money, just take it back. "The dope"? How old are you? You fucking entertaining yourself? You want the shit back or not? They've never taken it back before. Why would they start now? 'Cause I'm not a drug dealer. Yet here we are. Who is this? Who are you speaking for? - You have all the dope? - That's right. I'll tell you where to bring it. No. We'll call you back with a place to go. Hold that thought. Fuck. T! Tina! Yeah? You still wanna tell me what to do? What's goin' on? You got greedy. You could've walked away. These are the consequences of being greedy, Nick. What is this thing? That's what was in the money. That's what lead me to the money. That thing is what lead me to your wife. Where do you want this stuff? I'll bring it to you right now. You just wait for my call now. Wait, hang on a... How did it get to this, man? They took the money and the coke. Why? Transponder was with the money. Someone else sold the coke. Where are they? Who fucking cares, man? They've got my wife! Take it easy, take a breath. One minute at a time. Look, I'm gonna get you in deep water with this shit. I'm just gonna go to the cops. FBI, I'll go to the FBI. They handle kidnappings. Listen, listen. You got bodies, coke and Gus. All of that. How are you gonna explain all of that? I'll just tell 'em. I'll tell 'em- - Tell 'em what? The truth? Yeah, that keeps everybody out of prison. Hey, this is Tina. Please leave a message after the beep. Hey. It's me. I just want you to know how sorry I am. I love you. God bless America, land of the free. I found the land of the free. It's a 24-hour neon vacuum. Viva Las Vegas. Home of the worker bees. The place you make it when you can't. Cookie-cutter houses surrounded by $50 hooker billboards. Every Monday is New Years Eve. Sunday is church, otherwise known as the sports book. 4 AM lobster, 10 AM happy hour. If this is the end of the road, then I've found Shangri La. I'm right at home. I'm just gonna go. I'm just gonna go down there. I gotta get her back. Whoa. Just in case they try to burn you. You don't gotta go. It's okay, I'll go by myself. I'll get her. Listen, listen. You can't go alone. That's what they said. They want me to go alone. I'll go ahead of you. I know the place. I'll get there early, lay low, just in case. Okay. The dark night has brought everything but peace. The entire metro police force finds themselves outnumbered by rioters that have spread destruction all over the city. Protestors faced off with police, throwing rocks, setting cars on fire and looting... You killed a good man today. I don't think there are any. Oh, that's convenient. Well, that's my reality. Yours is going to be short if you don't look out. You still have their product. They are coming. What do you care? You got your money. Why aren't you letting her go? Because I see an opportunity that you created. You hesitate when you're in danger, but if it's someone you love, then you are a bulldozer. You want your wife back? Be a bulldozer. Separate yourself from emotions and just act. If it's any consolation, we're the good guys. You're supposed to be some dangerous whatever. You know what I think? I think you're just a paper tiger. I stop time, asshole. You don't wanna do it? Fuck off and find your wife. I'll do it, okay? I just hope you know what you're doin', because I am far away from this kind of life. They play checkers. I'm Bobby Fisher, and you? You're the lone wolf. I'm gonna level with you. I gave myself an extra day to get things right. I mean, things get fucked up all the time but not like this. Not like this. - Who called you? - I don't know. Whoever called me said the product would be there and they would be there with it. You guys got there and just immediately got ambushed? Pretty much. We got ourselves a true blue enemy here, don't we? What did he say? He said somebody come up behind 'em and started shooting. You end these cowboys' parade, you understand? Copy that. Go back and get the other guy! What the fuck? Hey, fuck you! No, fuck you! Hey, he's coming. He's following me, man. I see him. - How? - Quiet. He's staying back. Just drive. I'm gonna tell you where to go. Yeah, they just shot Doyle. I need some guys out here ASAP. We're on Trop and Russel. Just pulling into this parking lot. Yeah. Don't move or I will cut you in fuckin' half. Get back in your fuckin' car and get the fuck outta here, thinking you're gonna get the drop on me. I wasn't gonna do anything. I just wanted to fuckin' talk to you. Just don't leave me in the dark, okay? I just wanna know what's goin'... You pulled the trigger. Well, that's nothing to be proud of. - It kept your wife alive. - Who are these guys? They don't look like drug dealers. And what does a drug dealer look like? Who are they? They're greedy people, like you. People that wanna take what's not theirs. Riddles. Just a bunch of cute riddles outta you. They have no interest in talking to you. They want you dead. Who are you and who are you with? 'Cause I know you can't be doing this alone. I keep the order. Yeah and I'm just a pawn you like playin' around with huh? Stop feeling sorry for yourself. I'm texting you an address. Go stay there and keep your phone on. Hey, how's it goin'? Can I help you? Yeah, um... I hope so. Um, what you looking for? I'm not really looking for anything. I know that you're sellin'. I'm lookin' to sell, too. But not like a competition. Listen. I got somethin' I gotta get rid of. "Rid of"? I got a bunch of coke. I'm lookin' to sell it at a great price tonight to somebody. All right, well, how much you got? I got a lot. Okay, so why me? You kinda got like a drive-up window here. No offense. I was just thinking maybe you could use it. Well, you never bought from me before, and I never see you around here, Officer. I'm not a cop, I'm a mecha... Look, I'm a mechanic, okay? Listen, I got a shop. Somebody left this car inside my shop. It's been there for over two months. Nobody has come around lookin' for it. Nothin'. I open up the trunk, it's full of coke. Let me just pull over here and show you what I got. Maybe you've got somebody that'll buy some. That's all I'm sayin'. All right, pull up. Yo, is that real? It better be. I mean, how did you get so... I mean, look at all this! You know somebody? I mean, maybe. I mean, but with all this cream... You definitely don't look like Cartel. What are Cartel supposed to look like? Well, they got a wild look in they eyes, and you definitely don't have that. Yeah, I'm classy, okay? Yeah, me too. So what do you think? I mean, you can give me a couple of these and, uh, I got a guy and, I mean, if the price is cool, he'll buy it. You set it up and I'll give you five grand, just for the introduction. All right. Call him. You know, I think I've had enough of Vegas. Just wanna... Wanna go someplace where people are more accountable. Why don't you try Tampa? - It's like that there? - No, but it's got the beach. Okay. Good enough. Tell me about this guy. He's, uh... He's a thundercat, but he's cool. - What's makes him cool? - He ain't cheap. So if you're not cheap, you're cool? I mean, do you know anybody that's cheap that you thought was cool? That's a good point. So, what're you gonna tell him where you got all this from? I'll tell him I pitched eggs in a basket and won it. Good answer. And, uh, how much have you snorted? I haven't touched it. So you got tons of coke and you didn't try it yet? I don't like drugs, man. I'm a light beer guy. - What, like Coors Light? - Coors Light! - That's like water! - From the tit of an angel. Oh, wow. That should actually be in a commercial. "Coors Light, from the tit of an angel." That's right. It'd make a hell of a billboard, huh? Yes, definitely. So does your wife know you a coke dealer? Why don't you call this guy? I mean, is that a sore spot or somethin'? Look, I'm just a guy who's trying to make a quick buck here, all right? And that usually doesn't work out. So let's just see if we're the lucky ones tonight. All right. So, they left this behind, huh? They must be dead. I mean, that's good for you, right? Depends. On what? If you're tellin' the truth. I've seen these markings before. That's a LEO. What's LEO? It's the dark side of the fucking moon. Well, you wanna make a deal? How many you got? I counted 30, at 25 apiece? I'll give you a half a million for all of 'em. That's a hell of a discount, man. You don't have to play poker with me, man. Shoot him! Yeah. Jesus, that was close. I almost fucking shot you. You think it's easy finding a major coke buyer? Then why don't you set me up? The drug business doesn't recruit from MENSA. Hey, fuck you! You entertaining yourself? Why don't you just watch me take a shit, too? Ah, you're embarrassed. - Oh, that's funny. - Don't worry. Not a lot of guys could play that game. You know what? It's a filthy fucking business, and I want nothin' to do with it. Yeah, but just like all the rest, you found the bitch, so you break all the rules- - Hey, Hemingway, do me a favor. Save me the lecture, okay? When I am done with this, I am gone forever. For a while. Then you'll be on your couch for another night of network TV wife and kids sleeping on you, and she'll start calling. You think you've got me clocked, man. I am not who you think I am. I know exactly who you are. You're a killer now. You know what? You're the fuckin' devil. Nah, I just drink his wine. The playa verde cartel gave me three million in cash to pay off Nogalus DEA. I marked all the bills, which, mind you, took fucking days. I delivered the cash to Agent Martin Kemp. He offered me $350,000, which I took, marked, and turned in to my supervisor Jack Winston. When I asked for a salary advance for personal needs, I was declined. Next, I was transferred to the Nova Scotia office within a month. Guess they sent me to clean things up. I guess I was too clean for their liking. - How is she? - Good. Let me talk to her. Finish the mission, you get your wife. The mission? What are you, CIA? DEA? Maybe. Or, um, maybe I'm just a rich citizen with a hard-on for scumbags. Great. Now you're Batman. Jerk. Welcome to the wild west. Riots, protests, keeping the cops busy. Scared locals off the streets. Only people left are the players, making for prime killing conditions. You make it sound like a sport. There's no sportsmanship. But if that works for you. What works for me is getting out of this. You follow my directions, you walk away from this clean. Clean? You just got me a front-row seat in hell. You bought the ticket, pal. I'm just taking you for the ride. Now, pay attention. You've got a busy night ahead of you. Where am I going? Take a left. Tell me where I'm going. You're going to school. Hookers are your entry into the underworld. You need a gun and you're in a town you don't know anyone? Find a hooker. But drugs, volume drugs? Strip club. Five AM is prime time. It's drug dealer happy hour. Everything is closed. This city is shut down. Business is booming. So, where are they? I give up. The situation tonight is very fluid. With looting underway, police seem to have had enough. The scene tonight opened up with destruction. Fires burned as first responders struggled to keep up with the pace of the flames. With tear gas choking the streets, police battled protestors to keep control of their headquarters. - What am I getting into? - It was Plan B. This is Dom's operation. - Who's Dom? - Dom is a man with a plan. - And you know him? - I know what I need to know. You ask for him. You tell him Nero sent you. - Nero, who's Nero? - The Ghost of Vegas Past. You gotta really get a grip on that, you know? The way you talk? - He's a gangster. - What is he, 100? There haven't been gangsters here in 50 years. Jesus. I could fill a stadium with what you don't know. Who's that? It's Nick. Nero sent me. - Come in. Are you alone? - Yeah. I call Nero, what's he gonna tell me? Well, he's gonna tell you to get ready to make the best deal of your life. So what do you think, 23 apiece? Okay, but I was... Look, I just don't wanna go back and forth all night with this. - Then just say yes. - Yes. There we go. So how's business? Up is down. This virus fucked the whole world up. Everybody wants an escape. People don't got a spaceship to get off this planet and the only other way is through the end of that straw. You got a hell of a set up here, man. We got it all. Girls, gamblin', the whole floor. Come by later and check it out. So how do you know Nero? Good, I don't want you talking about me either. I like that. Now that wasn't so hard, was it? Why was he the second choice? Because of who he works for. So you don't fuck with gangsters? South of the border are the most violent gangsters in the world. I fuck with them, day and night. What's the difference between their gangsters and these? Here, they use violence as a tool. There, it's most like an addiction. You think being a monkey wrench in their world makes you the good guy? I lied. About what? Just drinking the devil's wine. Well, hello. It's nice to finally meet you in person. So, what's this good deal you have for me? I can make your problems go away. So you're a cop? No, I'd say more like the invisible man. All right, well I don't have time for this shit. Listen, listen. Your boyfriend? He has too much money. Oh and I guess you wanna take it? Yeah, I do, and uh... How do you feel about that? Well, I guess I feel really expensive. Okay, I'm here. What are we doin'? They're bringing in a heavy hitter to clean your clock. And what is that? Some kind of mob shit? Get the drop on him before he gets in the car. You gotta be fucking crazy. I'm at an airport. There's an army of cops here. You're in the fucking parking lot. You can get away, as long as you do what I say. Yeah? And what if he takes a cab? He's got a ride coming. I'm reading his texts right now. Yeah. You drop this on me right now? You know what a carrot sounds like? Really? - What's up, man? - What's up? - How you doin'? - How was the flight? I haven't been here in years. Yeah, well, it's a real city now. Football team, stadium, everything. You go to a game? No, man, they might as well play on the moon. That's such a fucking shame. All that money. So what're you, uh... What're you doing? What? Where I'm staying? Well, no. Well, yeah, that too. But, uh, why are you here? Oh, I'm here to work. I came here to collect with you. You know you're being followed, right? Yeah, I figured. And as far as collecting, we're not collecting. We're taking. We have to take it. You really got this guy turned around, huh? So, uh, have you heard from, uh, "them"? What would they say? They got greedy, they're on the run. Ah, we outgrew 'em. Yes, yes. I like that. Exactly. We outgrew 'em. They bought the ticket! Right? I mean, it's cops that wanna be gangsters. Now they're nothin' and they've got no home. What is this guy just taking heads? Well, if you take a man's wife, you give him all the motivation he needs. He's doing things he never thought he would do. Kidnapping women? Well, you've gone ahead and taken this to a whole another level. I'm just doing what I have to do. You deliver the goods! I control information. - Yeah. - Forget about him. Can't do it now. Get him tomorrow. Oh, no way. No, let's do this right now. Let's get it over with. Listen, you don't tell me. I tell you. You told me. You said he goes away and my wife goes home. If you're not gonna stand by that, you're not gonna stand by anything. Let's do this. Listen, you heard me. I said- - Oh, yeah. Hey, hey, you know what a carrot sounds like? Whoa, whoa! Hang on, hang on! - You got the wrong guy. - Oh, no, I don't. It's gonna be me or you, right? Huh? It's gonna be me or you? That son of a bitch. He lied to you. Look, listen. He don't have your wife. Look, all he told me was that she was gonna leave you. He was gonna use you until you either found out, or got killed. He can lock, he can block, he can change your number. As long as you have a phone, he can control you. Prove it. She left a note. But if you call her from any phone, he's gonna know. Look, she's on the run, and he's focusing on you. So she's safer. What did he tell you about me? He said you were some hitter they brought out to kill me for the coke. Oh, that fuckin' screw. He wants it all for himself. So you're telling me the two of you are in this together? We were. He wanted me to wait until tomorrow. I'm the one that came here to kill you tonight. Because he found out he needed me. For what? Another night of protest and riots. Tonight, the governor says he's calling on thousands of soldiers to quel the violence. Early this evening, police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protestors. Police are at full alert, working double shifts, in an attempt to control angry protestors. We are only two hours into the curfew, and police are stating that they are stretched thin. All just a big fuckin' game, huh? My wife, my life, my family. Just a big fuckin' joke to you guys. Joke's on me. I'm supposed to be dead, right? What'd your wife take off on you for anyway? I don't know, why? We just weren't getting along. She just... What? Actually, nothing. It's none of your fuckin' business. Look, man! I don't know what you got planned- - I do. Yeah, you're gonna take me over to him right now. Oh, what, and act like everything's cool and just drop you into his lap? Yeah, I can live with that. Do you even know why he wants you to kill me? No, and I don't give a shit why. We were gonna be taking a lot of money from someone tomorrow. He's cutting me out! And then, he kills you. That's nice. You know what I'm thinkin'? That me and you take the money? Well, that didn't burn a whole lot of calories, but yeah. How much? Five million. How about that? We both act like we're gonna call him, and... Hey, where's your cell phone? It's in my car. Perfect! He's clocking me right now. I am sure of it. He thinks I'm off running around, and you're waiting for me back in the car. So? So we keep it that way. As long as you have the code, you're good anywhere in the world. Well, I'm gonna need the code to verify. If you don't mind. Really? That's part of the deal we made. I will give you the code, as soon I have the confirmation of the delivery. What's this? He's with me. Delivery confirmed. That was fast. And payment in full. Well, I guess cash isn't king anymore. People used to think it was impossible to make money out of thin air, but here we are. So what's the code? I just gave you the code, didn't I? You're in my phone! Come on, come on! - Tell me you got it! - I got it. What the fuck are you doing? Motherfucker! I was thinking about what you said about me being greedy. Do you need some closure, sweetheart? You just fuck with people's lives. You don't have the decency to admit it, do ya? I have an ex-wife for these kind of conversations. You have an ex-wife 'cause you're a piece of shit. You digress. Oh, I'm serious. Yeah but I don't take you serious. Was I greedy, hm? Was I greedy when I gave up everything and changed my life? Put everything into that shop? Was I greedy then? Is there a point to this? Yeah, you don't deserve this. You're not greedy? You're a born fuckin' loser. You're that guy that quits before the finish line because his daddy's not clapping. You want something to cry about? I'll show you the meaning of regret. Telephone tough guy. Yeah, try me. Your wife will be pulling gang bangs at zoos in Mexico. You're still trying to pull that card, huh? Oh, make no mistake. I'm always up for some scorched earth. Yeah, you like this, huh? This high-stakes dance? No more than any other tango. You can still be a rich man, if you play your cards right. You're right. Yeah? Yeah. We do need each other, don't we? But as soon as this is done, we go our separate ways and you stay the fuck out of my life. There was always a plan for this to end, and that is tomorrow. Tomorrow it is. So what do you need from me? Can you get me the keystrokes off of that? I mean, it's a little advanced, but I think I can do it. Okay, so let me get this straight. You go out and you cut yourself a deal, using my name? I had to make that deal, man. You had to make this deal. And then you go out and you sell a stolen load that implicates me. Look, I didn't... You didn't what? You didn't what? You didn't think? And now you come walking into my place, and you're offering me money for what? For fucking me? I'm here to give you a way better deal. Listen, I don't know you, all right? But I do know that you use my name. Do you know how that makes me feel? It's five million dollars. Five million? Buddy, I seriously don't know you. I don't know if you're SI, if you're the state police. No. I'm a mechanic, okay? - A mechanic? - Yeah. I got a shop over on boulder highway, all right? The other night, some guys do a drug deal in front of my place, it goes south, I ended up with all of this stuff. Okay, so you're telling me that was you? Yeah. Okay, well, now that we know who you are, let me ask you, how the fuck did you know who I was? I don't, somebody just gave me your name and I used it to make the deal. That's not quite clearing it up for me, buddy. Look, I'm sure people use your name all the time to get shit. This time, you're gonna get something big for it. This time, my friend, I better. Hey. It's me, Nick. So were you able to get the keystrokes off of that phone? That's great. That's it? Just four numbers. Oh, thank you very much. So all you need is the codes for this? You have access to that kind of cash, right? Yeah, I do. I have access to a lot of things. But what I need to know is whether or not this is real. It's very real. And out of this, all you want is two million cash? I get three million, and why is this again? Because you're gonna inherit my enemy, and I'm gonna take off with my cash and disappear. You're talkin' the hacker? Mm-hm. Well, I think I can handle a hacker, but what I'm not sure about is whether or not I can believe and trust in you. - Why? - Well, why should I? Remember, you went out and lied about me. What makes me think you won't lie to me? Well, you're still talking to me, right? That I am, but I have my own vetting process. Okay, I'm here. I'm gonna text you the address. Just ask for Chic. And what's that got to do with me? I want you to put a bullet in his head. Forget it. Just forget it, the deal's off. Listen, I don't forget anything. You kill him, or you have a new enemy. No, I didn't find anything. No, the place is clean. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'll get back to you. Okay. You call that clean? You mind pointing that over here? Don't worry about where I point, 'cause I haven't shot anybody in a few hours. Is this your friend? That guy? I don't think he has any friends. How'd he end up like that? I don't know, I just found him dead. I'm not a cop, and you sure as fuck ain't no tourist. You don't wanna end up like that, you're gonna tell me what the hell's goin' on here. I didn't shoot anybody, okay? This guy over here? He owes a lot of people money. I don't even know him. You're a pro. A pro? Me? I'm no pro. I'm a scout leader. Yeah, and I'm the fuckin' Pope. Bro. Relax. Chill. I don't wanna be involved in any of this shit. Just let me disappear. I got a better idea for you. How you doin'? I'm different. I just feel different. You remember what you told me when we got married? Yeah. If you meant it, then- - Well, that's because I wanted to share my life. I didn't wanna be alone. I thought it was sad to be alone. I just didn't know. I didn't know I was always alone. Always gonna be. That's not true. Don't say that. Look. I don't want to stop. I don't want to now, man. I have got only so much life left, and I don't wanna spend it under a dirty car. That's crazy. Take what you got and go. You stick to your plan and don't look back. You didn't want me before, anyway. No, stop. Don't say that. Go be happy, T. Don't get blood on your hands for money. Money's more loyal than love. So, I hear, uh, auto shop went out of business last night? Caught fire? Yeah, it wasn't a bad location, either. So, how is this business? The pot business? Well, if you've gotta ask, then maybe you better stick to brakes. Let me see that thing. Money. You'll smell the money, as soon as I know it's real. It's time for you to disappear, my friend. Look at you. All grown up. You didn't really think I was gonna let you ride off into the sunset with that, did you, Nick? No, I figured you'd be right up my ass. Nicky. I can call you Nicky, can't I? Listen, Nicky, contentment? Being content? It's for cattle. What? The auto body shop, the wife. That's not for Nick. That's for another breed. I released you from that. I set you free. Now, you can be you. You're telling me that I'm gonna walk away from this car alive? Well, the devil offered Jesus the world, didn't he?
