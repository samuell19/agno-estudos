(violin note) - [Violinist] This time, I'm ready. I'm not going to choke. (violin music) (metronome clicks rhythmically) (violin music) - Pound the onions, ginger and chilies with the garlic into a smooth paste in a mortar. You know, Grandma cooked a curry that was so spicy and rich, and she made it without any fucking appliances. - Housewives don't want tradition, they want convenience. Trust me. - Mom always grilled it. She said it produces an infinitely richer flavor. - I'm following Dad's recipe, and he told me that I cooked this dish better than you. - Shut up, Dad never said you cooked this better than me, and you're cutting the ginger too thin. It needs to be thicker. - I've got to get to work, chopping is chopping. - "Chopping is chopping." Crazy they haven't offed themselves yet. - People need help sometimes, and believe it or not, I'm making a difference. - Yeah, yeah, sure. You're making a difference, but right now, you're fucking cooking paratha, so cut that shit thicker! (phone rings) - Answer the phone. - Yes, hello? - [Man] Yeah, you promised me this place was quiet. Every day I deal with the same bullshit. Until you take care of this, I am not paying rent. - Please calm down, I can't hear you. - [Tenant] No shit you can't, no one can, and I'll calm down when you kick her ass out. - Okay, okay, I'm coming over! - What's going on? - That crazy lady in 15. I'll be right back in one minute. (violin music) (metronome clicks) (knocks) (metronome clicks) - Oh, hi. - You're late, again. And you're too loud. Look, if you can't pay rent today, you're out, okay? I've been patient with you, and now you're bothering the paying tenants. - Hold on, I'll get it for you. - I've heard this before, when are you going to get it? - Now, just, just give me a second. - Pay it today or pack your shit! - Oh, my gosh, I wish I was in New York, too. I'll be there soon, though. I told my brother that I'd meet his stupid friend tomorrow. (speaks foreign language) - Hey, uh... This may not be the best time to ask, but, I was thinking, if you're free tonight, I'm cooking some partha and my brother's out for the evening so if you want to come over, you know... So, what do you say? (wind chimes ring) Shit, the fucking fire escape? (speaks foreign language) - Did you deal with her? - She wasn't home. And put the fan on, yeah? - She slipped away? You don't have to cry, it's okay, she'll be back. - You're cutting onions, you fuck! - Mom didn't like it when we fought. Especially when we were cooking. "Cook with love, better, and don't fight." (both laugh) And then, Dad, "But if you must fight, make sure you win!" - Yeah, "Make sure you kick some ass!" (both laugh) Everything seems so much fresher back home, you know? The fruits, (sniffs) the vegetables, the spices. - No preservatives. - Right. Are you done with those onions? Give them to me. Think they should go in now. - You know, Dad would have loved this. (somber atmospheric music) - Otis! Otis! I'm home! I know you're not still sleepin'. I grabbed the clothes from the drier. Help me put it all out. - Hey, baby. - Hey! - That didn't take long. - Ah, they cut my shift, they didn't need me all day. - Let's get some coffee. - Okay, but let me change into my slippers first. My feet are killin' me. - Relax, I'll get 'em for ya. - What's the matter with you? - That's alright I'll get 'em. Baby, Barbara... - Touch me again, Otis. - Baby? - I swear. - Baby? Baby. Baby. They say timing is everything. But in my case, timing wasn't on my side. Hell, to tell the truth, I don't even know why I did it. I could say it was my first time, but I'd be lying. I was good at that. We all are. Telling ourselves that everything is okay, and we're going to make it, and this is the last time, I promise, when we know, deep, deep down, it's the exact opposite. - Here you go. - Great, thank you. - And then, I slapped her. (laughs) - Can we get two more shots, please? (chuckles) - She looks like Jessie. - Well, we're in LA. Everybody has blonde hair and blue eyes, except for you. - Well, here is to making a shitty day better. I didn't think it was possible, but it actually happened. - No worries. You can cheer me up next time. - Yeah. - Shit. - I don't fucking believe this. - [Otis] My dad used to say that opportunity makes the thief but I think stealing does. (woman sighs) And when you get caught, it's always the same question. Why me? Sometimes, you are your own worst enemy. - Are they like sweet or they are more like bitter? (melancholic violin music) I'll come back. (woman laughs) - Oh, oh, and then he said, "I wanna wake up next to you every morning." (friend laughs) Can you believe it? - After four dates? No, he didn't, sweetie. - What should I do? He's sweet and all but... - It is so much better to bruise his heart now than to break it later. It's for the best to move on. (phone rings) - Hello? - Hi, honey, it's Dad. How are you? - Great, busy day, I got an oil change, picked up my dry cleaning and then a few groceries. I'm going to a party with Jill. Hey, I gotta run, can I call you tomorrow? Dad? Is everything okay? - [Father] Honey, I... I have to tell you something. I wanted to do it in person, but... - What's wrong? - I hate to bother you with all this. I know you have a ton on your plate with school and work. - Dad, what is it? - [Father] I have cancer. - No! - Pancreatic, the doctor says... - You can't, you're fine. - Darling, I need to tell you. It doesn't look good. They can't really do anything for me. - The doctor's wrong. The doctor doesn't know that you're a fighter. We all are. We'll beat this. - He told me to come home and put everything in order. - How long, Dad? - I know you have your life there, and you've worked really hard at your job to get ahead. - How long did the doctor say? - And I'm proud of you. I really am. But I need you to come home. Take care of your mom after I'm gone. Can you come home? (daughter sobs) - I, I... (sobs) - Shh, it'll be alright. You'll be okay. You'll be able to dust off your violin when you're back home and play that song I love so much. Remember? (hums melodically) (daughter sobs) - [Daughter] I love you. - I love you more. (daughter sobs) - Excuse, ma'am, are you okay? - Oh, I'm fine, thanks for asking. - [Otis] We all play parts in each other's lives, and you never really know how small or large your part will turn out to be. - God bless you. - [Otis] I just know that if I had it to do over again, I'd play my part differently. She deserved that much, at least. - I said I was sorry, what more do you want? Just forgive me already. Jess. - Leave me alone, Luke! - Jess, come back here please. Jess, would you please come back here? God damn it, Jess! Would you come back here, please? - [Otis] I keep hoping I might bump into her. (solemn organ music) Maybe coming out of church. ♪ Put down your troubles ♪ ♪ And take these keys I'm offerin' you ♪ ♪ Unlock the door and finally ♪ ♪ Be freed ♪ ♪ Live in the sunshine ♪ - With nothing left and nowhere to go, I spend my time now with the ones who will have me. I got what you want, I know. (chuckles) There, my babies. (chuckles) Alright, alright, alright. Settle down. Yeah, you're looking good. We gonna have a good time today. Nice to see you today. Y'all in good spirits, I see. Yeah. Oh, yeah. (chuckles) Aww. Ah, oh! There, look at you. (chuckles) You too good to eat with the others, huh? Puttin' on airs, you think you better than them. You never did just wanna be one of the flock. Think you special, I take it? (chuckles) Nice to be special. Different. Maybe that's why God made us all unique, yeah? That's what I thought, yeah. Well, it's gettin' kinda late. It was good seein' y'all today. Goodbye, my friends, it's gettin' late. Got to check in at the metro hotel. No muss, no fuss, all night bus. Bye bye, babies. - What're you mad about? Where are you going, Jess? Jessie, can you come back here, please? Come on, I said I was sorry. It was just one drink, she's my co-worker! She was fired today and I was just tryin' to cheer her up. I mean, why are you getting so crazy? Jess, where are you going? - Getting the hell away from you! You're a dick, Luke. You always have been and you always will be. - Jess, you need to calm down, you are acting... - [Otis] Funny how the honeymoon always ends. For better, or for worse. Ain't that a fact. In sickness... And in health. Till death. - Excuse me, sir. - I can't help you. - You know I needed you today, to be there for me? - [Stranger] I'm lost, I don't know how to go! - Too busy comforting a co-worker. Really? - Hell, we all lost, brother. - Damn. - Nothing you ever say is true, Luke. You only think about yourself. You need help, you need professional help. - No. - [Jess] Really? It's not a big deal? I needed you to be there for me for one hour. - Where are you goin'? - (chuckles) Central City, starting my new job tomorrow. - Work, huh? - Yeah. - Good for you. Take the big blue bus, number five. - I'm tired of this all, Luke. And I'm done. - And you can't miss it. - Thank you. I appreciate your kindness. Thank you! - [Otis] But life keeps rollin' right along. Whether I like it or not. Honestly, I think I've missed most of it. It seems everyone has a purpose. A place to be. Regret can take a hold of you when you least expect it, and only God knows how to shake it. - So, do you know where Beth is right now? - (sighs) Where? - Third Street Promenade. And where are we? - [Young Man] Wait, wait, I got this, I got this. Excuse me, sir, wait, hold on. - What you need, son? - I need smokes and a bottle of Jack. - Tall order for a short guy. - Who're you callin' short? - Inward, please, I got suits older than you. - Suits, really? Please, you were young once. Just this once. Thank you, thank you so much. I got this, Amy. What the hell is this? - Taxes, shorty. - And where is my Jack? - Drinking's somethin' you wanna start late in life. Trust me. (somber atmospheric music) - [Old Woman] Sort these out. That one's brown, this one's green. Green over here, brown over there. No, you can't sort them for me, you never could sort. I'm the sorter, you're not the sorter. I'm the one who should do that. - Hi. (Otis belches) - [Otis] Bring me another cold one. - Why do you do that? - Good luck. What did the doctor say? - The miscarriage was bad. (sighs) But the medicine should clear up my infection soon. So we can try again, when you're up to it. (phone vibrates) Hello? - [Woman] Hello, this is the DA's office for Barbara Clark. - Mm-hm. - [Woman] I'm confirming your deposition next week. - Okay. - Monday at 10. - I'll be there. - Room 102, end of the hall. - Okay, thank you. - Thank you. - Mm-hm, bye bye. - Goodbye. - [Otis] Before Barbara, I had a kid. (sighs) If my son could see his old man now. Damn. He probably wouldn't even recognize me. Nor me him, to be honest. But I still search for him in the faces of every young black man I see. It's a habit I can't break now. - Jess. Jess. Jess, how long are you gonna stay mad at me? Look, we belong together, you know that. It can't be over, this is silly. - You don't get it, do you? I deserve someone that makes me feel better, not piles more shit onto me. - So I'm shit? I'm shit? - I can't do this with you anymore, Luke. You need help. You need professional help. - Jess, Jess! You come back here. - Hey, you shit-head! You want a face full of mace? Go crawl into a bar, she clearly doesn't wanna talk to you! Hey, you didn't get my message? - Apparently not, I've been sittin' here for 20 minutes. - Sorry, something came up. I can't hang out tonight and I gotta catch the bus. - Forget the bus, I'll give you a ride. - [Woman] Alright. - It'll be a fun ride. - Alright, but not drinking while driving, that's illegal. - Hey, who's driving? You don't see the keys in the ignition. (homeless man groans and coughs) - Jesus Christ. We were blessed yesterday. It's time to share our good fortune. He doesn't need it. She gave us the money, he's just sittin' there, askin' for a hand-out, fuck him! You're wrong. That's not what the Good Book says, we're better than that. Are we? We're hungry, too. You gave away all our food to the pigeons. We're all God's creatures. Bullshit. - Maybe, but when it comes to our weather and our beaches, nobody can touch us. - Cheers. - Cheers. - That's very true. - And plus, I love it out here so much because, you know, it's like anything is possible. - Yeah, it's possible that you're gonna get stuck in horrendous traffic and everyone you meet is gonna be a rude actor. - Yeah, seems to me like you fit right in. - Hey, I try. - (sighs) Man, I don't even know why I agreed to take you out in the first place. (moody atmospheric music) (homeless man coughs) - That nigga about to die. He won't need his things. Now is your chance, man, go on, take it all. - I'm more... - Rigid. - Structured. - Which explains why you don't like it here. - What? What do you mean? - See, LA required a certain mindset. A certain letting go of expectations and your frustrations and, well, your inhibitions. - Looks like you're about to make your move. I should let go of inhibitions, huh? - (sighs) Man, you don't get it. You're just so focused on yourself, you're so self-absorbed. You realize you haven't asked one thing about me this whole entire time? - Messin' with somebody, that's not who I am. Fuck him! No, no, uh-uh, no. No, that's not, that's not, that's not, that's not who I am. That's not who I've become. I am learning, in whatever state, to be content. - Truth is... I couldn't fit in here. I didn't make any friends. - Well, you have your brother, and me. Just show me the real you. - No, it's okay. Let's talk about you. What do you do? - I work with autistic kids and I love it. I mean, it's hard work but, for me, the worst day on the job is better than the best day at any desk job. So, we work on starting over. You know, it's kinda like havin' a record player and takin' the needle, and putting it all the way back to the beginning. I bet there are times when you get caught in the loop. - Yeah. - You just need to be reset. Start over. (woman chuckles) You could always do it here. You don't have to go 3000 miles across the country to do it. (melancholic piano music) - [Otis] I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me. (car starts) - I thought we were having a good time? - (chuckles) Exactly. If we have too much fun, you may give LA a second chance. - (chuckles) Unlikely.

I have tried everyone and you're the only one who answered. You know, I've never gotten through to Sarah on this number. Between you and me, I bet she put down the wrong number. Not that she would work a shift for someone else, anyway, I am in a real bind, you are my only hope. What I would not give to just drop the kids off somewhere for the weekend and have a... - And the salt? - [Judy] Is there any way you could cover my shift tonight? That would be the best, and I will make it up to you, I promise. - Of course, I'm free. - You are a life-saver. - [Barbara] I'll leave now, if you want. I just need to grab my things. - Thank you so much. - Okay. - [Judy] Okay, gotta run. - Alright. - Thanks. - Bye bye. - Bye! - You never use enough salt. - Whatever you say, dear. - What can I get you? - Scotch, a double, please. - No, you got it? - Yeah! - [Woman] Oh my God, that's amazing! Aw, cheers to you. - Cheers. - Here is to the newest cast member of America's Most Eligible Bachelor. - Thank you, thank you. Thank you. - Thank you so much. - Well, look, it's just a reality show, so it doesn't really pay that well. - Hey, you may have started off as a hair model, but you got talent, kid, I know you're gonna make it. You just needed a break, that's all. - Um, I did wanna ask you somethin', though. - I really love being with you. (chuckles) - No, I know, I know, but look, don't interrupt. Let me just, let me just get this off my chest. - Oh, okay, (chuckles) go for it. Don't be shy, I won't bite. Unless you want me to. - Okay, um... I can't catch what you have, right? - What do you mean? - Well, you know. Your disease, why you don't have any hair. I mean, I just need to know, because my hair's my career right now and, you know, if we, well, if we go all the way, that I can't catch it. - "It?" - Yeah! - It's alopecia! I just can't grow hair, it's not contagious. (sighs) No, you're not gonna get anything from me, ever. - Good, 'cause that's what I was really worried about. Grace, come on, I didn't mean it. (sighs) - [Waitress] Is everything alright? - Just the check for that asshole. - Double. - [Luke] God. - That egotistical, shallow bastard. I deserve so much better than that. You don't need him. I don't even watch his stupid show. (sighs) I'm better off without him. (phone chimes) I'm better on my own, I'm beautiful on my own. (chuckles) (chuckles) Mm, kinda hot. - Fuck it. (phone rings) (phone rings) God, where are you? (phone rings) - [Jess] Hi, this is Jessie's cellphone. If you leave a message, the real Jessie will call you back. Have a beautiful day. - Hey. It's me, uh... If I get some help... Then I think I can be what you need. Because you're right. You deserve better. (Grace chuckles) - His loss. Hey, I'll close up tonight, you can get outta here. - You sure? I hate to leave you alone. - I don't have any plans tonight. - Thanks. Hey, text me when you leave, okay? - I can't, phone's dead, but I'll call you when I get home. Should I grab that? (phone rings) - Fuck it, we close in 10 minutes. Let that fucker go to voicemail. (waitress chuckles) Hey. (phone rings) Have Carlos toss that motherfucker outta here, okay? Just close, go home. (melancholic piano music) (car alarm wails) - [Otis] And when all is said and done, and you're left with yourself, you have to live with the choices you've made. - Eddie! - [Voicemail] Auto-play is on. You have 37 saved messages. - I'm the popular one tonight. - [Voicemail] Saved message. - [Woman] Hello, this message is for Mandy Gates. I'm calling from St. Joseph's Hospital. I'm so sorry, but your brother was brought in this evening in critical condition. You should come down here immediately. - [Man] Honey, your mom and I are still at the hospital. Come down, sweetie, we need you. - [Woman] Mandy, you know I'm here for you. Call me if you need me. - [Woman] Hey, Mandy? It's Aunt Edna. I'm at the hospital with your mom and dad. It's Evan, he's in bad shape. We're all praying, but it doesn't look good. Please, get here as soon as you can. - [Man] Hey, it's Robbie. Oh my God, I just found out what happened to Evan. I'm so sorry, I can't believe this. I mean, I just talked to him this morning, I thought, we were supposed to go out but something came up and, I can't believe he went through this and he was by himself, I just, I wish that I had been there. I should've been there. I just wish there was something I could do. Can you give me a call? (overlapping voice messages) - [Woman] Oh, sweetheart. He's gone. We need you here. I can't do this without you. (sobs) He was my baby and somebody hurt him. Where are you? - [Man] Hi, Mandy, this is Pastor Murrey. Faith in the Lord is even more important now. I'm praying for you and your family during this difficult time. - [Man] Hey, it's me, it's Al. Look, so I just got home and your Dad left me a voicemail, I raced back to the bar but you were already gone by then, so, um, please. Look, I'm sorry. Just call if you need anything and, uh, I'll be there. Just let me know. - [Woman] Mandy, your brother was so young and it's just not fair. Please, let me know if there's anything that I can do to help you. I'm right nextdoor. - [Man] Mandy, it's Uncle Henry. We just heard the tragic news. If you need to be with family, our door is always open. - [Woman] We're grieving with you, honey. All the girls here. Call us when you can, we wanna help. - [Evan] Hey, Sis, check this out. I just got off early, I'm serious, and I am literally in your neighborhood, okay? Let's go party, okay? Give me a call. Hey, Sis, it's me again. You know how you were saying I never call you? Well, this is me calling you again, (chuckles) trying to find you, I just wanna know, I tell you what, why don't you just tell me when you get home, and then I will go ahead and drop by. So just let me know when you're home and I'll drop by. Okay, call me. Hey, Sis, I am literally at your door. Eddie is barking, but no one is home. Oh shit, you're probably working tonight, aren't you? Right, I tell you what, why don't we do this? Why don't we, uh, I tell you what, I will find a dive bar, and I'll go hang out for a little while, and then you're done, you'll call me, we'll meet up, but the big part of this, like what I really need, to make this a reality is you actually need to call me. So if you could just call me when you get this, and I will be there waiting on you, I will push guys outta the way off the stools so I have a spot for you all night. I can't guarantee, but give me a call, okay? Call me, call me, call me. For this to work, you gotta call me, (chuckles) alright. Call me. - [Voicemail] There are no more messages. (phone keypad bleeps) (dark atmospheric tones) (phone rings) (phone rings) (phone rings) (phone rings) - Suicide Prevention... (busy tone hums) (sighs) - Slow night, huh, B? Only two calls for me. - Be thankful it's quiet tonight. - So quiet you can cover my lines, too? - Let me guess. Candice? Shirley? - Hot date, that's right. - Does this goddess have a name? - If I play my cards right, she'll be calling out my name at the end of the night. (both chuckle) - Go on, Raj, get outta here, and have yourself some fun while you're still young. - Thanks, I owe ya. - You do. (chuckles) (sighs) I don't have a hot date tonight. But I can still get me somethin'. What's sweets without milk? (phone rings) (phone rings) (phone rings) (phone rings) (phone rings) Hold on, hold on, hold on. (phone rings) Suicide Prevention Hotline. We're here to listen, let me help you. Hello? Is anyone there? I hear you breathin', that's good. That's real good. You keep breathin' and I'm gonna have a snack. And then maybe you'll be ready to talk. (sighs) Hm, sounds like you're havin' a snack, too. - Yeah, you got me. Liquid snacks are my favorite. - (sighs) Everyone needs somethin' to get through the day. - And night. - [Barbara] Amen. - You need faith for that. - I'm guessin' faith is on short supply in your house. (Luke sighs) Let's talk about it. Why the sigh? Regret? Guilt? Sadness? Sir, I got a long list, I can go on all night. - Don't call me sir. Regret. Always regret. I've wasted my time and now time's up. Jessie's gone. I'm completely alone. I'm Luke. And you are? - Hi, Luke, I'm Barbara. Nice to meet you. - What's your story, Barbara? Your life as empty as mine? You have any kids, any family? Is the thought of dying the only thing that gives you any hope? - No, Luke. (chuckles) My life is just great. - Bullshit, Barbara! Bullshit! I thought we were getting close. Developing trust. And then you go and lie to me? I'm hurt. Try again. Do you get paid to listen to losers like me all night, or do you volunteer your time like a good Christian woman? And if you are Christian... Will God get pissed at me for ending it all? Or is he as understanding as everybody says he is? - I never said I was Christian, or good. People gotta make a livin' somehow. Nothin' wrong with takin' pay for an honest day work. - If you call sitting on your fat ass while you drink your life away work, well hell, you deserve a fucking raise. - Luke. Only selfish people kill themselves. - Fuck you! - Did I strike a nerve? Is that you? Life got too hard. White boy done ran outta people to blame and booze to drink. Well, I'm no booty call, so get real, or go jump your ass off the bridge for all I care. - The thing about life... Is that you can fool others, but you can never fool yourself. (tense atmospheric music) I've tried. It's too hard and I'm too tired. (gun cocks) Goin' big, huh, Barb? One last drink before I go? Drinking on the job, fuck. Maybe you should kill yourself, too. - No, Luke, I'll pass. To be honest, you are a fuckin' loser. (chuckles) You know, LA would be a much better place with a little less traffic. And you're right, life is shitty. It beats you down until you pray for it to end, but the hurt keep on comin'. So, Luke. Either you end your whining, or you end your fuckin' life, you fuck! Fuck you. - Barbara? Fuck you very much. (gun clicks) Fuck! (gun clicks) Fuck! - [Otis] You hope and wish and pray for it to be different, but from where I sit, God seems to have better things to do. I don't blame him. I would, too. - Don't worry about Luke, he should worry about you. Not the other way around. - It's kinda hard. 'Cause today's the anniversary of my brother's death. So, everything reminds me of my brother today. It's stupid, but true. Even the smell of burnt waffles in the hallway. - What? Your brother liked burnt waffles, too? I thought I was the only one. - Yeah. Especially with chicken. - Your brother and I could've totally hung. - Have you ever heard of Rosco's? - As if there's anything else? - Fun-filled fact, syrup will kill you. I used to drown my waffles in it, but Americans... Seem to get fat so easily from it. - Really? (sighs) (somber atmospheric music) - [Otis] We met through a friend at work. I'll never forget our first date. She ordered a virgin daiquiri, and I ordered two shots of rum. One for me, and one for her. By the third round, we were sharing the same side of the booth, and I knew we'd be together forever. Here's to forever. (door opens) - [Woman] Otis Clark? - I want you to drink plenty of fluids, and get a lot more rest. The medication should start working immediately and you will be feeling better and healthier in no time at all. - Thank you, Dr. Thompkins. - You're welcome. - We'll see you next time. - Just give me a minute with your wife. I want to review your diet. Come with me. Mrs. Clark. (sighs) I don't want to see Otis again. - What do you mean? He's not well yet. And don't have another doc... - Let me finish, please. I don't want to see your husband here in my office again, because I suspect that what's making him ill will stop after today. Right now, in fact. I don't know why you're doing it, but I'm gonna tell you something, if you poison Otis again... - I have never been so insulted. I love my husband, Doctor, and I have stood with him through the worst of times, and it cost me everything. Everything. - [Thompkins] I'm notifying the authorities. - [Barbara] I just... (sighs) (doorbell rings) - What are you doing here? I don't wanna see you, will you please go away? - Please, I just need a minute of your time. I took the bus a long way to get here, I came to apologize. - Okay, then. Make it fast. - I didn't mean any disrespect. I just wanted to join in the conversation. Make friends. I'm sorry. - It's okay. I understand. There's no way that you could've known. - When I said... I could have drowned... - Please stop, or else I'm gonna start crying again. - Do you want to talk about it? - Not really. I know you mean well, but it hurts too much to talk about. I just, I just broke up with my boyfriend. Normally, I'd talk to him. - How did it happen? - The break-up or my brother? - Whichever you'd like. - He was my strong, funny, smart big brother. And I loved him more than anyone, even my parents. He went swimming in the woods with friends, and I was at camp that day. He, he hit his chest and he slid into the lake. And nobody knew it, but, he couldn't breathe or scream for help. And we searched for his body for five days. Before we found him. I know it happened 15 years ago, but not a day goes by that I don't think about him or miss him. He loved chicken and waffles. (chuckles) Rosco's was his favorite. - I understand. I love it, too. - Come on inside, Takashi. - Oh, baby, can you let me come home? - What're you doin' here? - I promise. - Otis, move. - If you give me another chance, we can work it all out. - I need you to go. - I know we can. Just, just let me explain. - Let you explain? I'm so tired of your explainin', Otis. - I know it's hard, I do, but together, we can work through this. (Barbara chuckles) - Together? Together. Well, please tell me. Tell me. I would just love to hear about your sexual exploits. You just had to share your VDs with me. Now I gotta go to the doctor every month to get that taken care of. Oh, and a never born child. I'm listenin', Otis. Explain. Go ahead, Otis. I'm listenin'. - I'm so sorry, baby. - You gettin' ready to cry now? Because I don't have time for that. - Please. - Put your god damn hands on me! Now, that is enough. I want you out of here, Otis. Out of here, it is over, done. I can't take another second with you, Otis. - Give me another chance, baby, I've changed. Trust me. God reminded me how to love. - God? So we gonna play the God game, Otis? We gonna play the God game? - God reminded me how to love. I can love you. - "God." - The way we used to. - Mm. - Let me take care of you, of us. (glass smashes) - Don't you put your god damn hands on me, Otis! - What you tryin' to do, kill me? - I've changed, too. And I don't have to put up with anyone's shit anymore. Now get your ass outta here, Otis. Get out. (car starts) - Death is hard to handle. Period. I'm sorry. I just don't know how to make peace with his death. - Life is a miracle. Don't regret that yours continues. Your brother would want you to live a life to its fullest. I brought for you. Well, actually, for him. - Is that chicken and waffles? - Your brother's favorite, right? In my culture, we honor the person passing into the next world by remembering how they live, what they love, what gave them joy. These are the things we cherish. I would like to perform a ceremony for your brother. And offer this food to him, to comfort him, wherever his spirit may be. And by comforting him, maybe you can gain some peace, too. - Where should the ceremony take place? - [Takashi] Did your brother have a favorite spot in the house? - [Jess] The bench outside. He used to read out there for hours. - [Takashi] Perfect, grab a photo of him and meet me there. - [Luke] Magic hour, my ass. Life sucks. You can have it. - [Otis] My son you're not the first one to contemplate that and my guess is, you won't be the last. - God? - (chuckles) No. Just a lonely man lookin' for a conversation. One last smoke for the road? - Thought I was losin' my mind. - (chuckles) I was thinkin' the same thing, when you climbed up on that railing. - Look, it's none of your business. I wasn't hurting you. - You're right. You're not hurting me. Just yourself. And God. - God? (chuckles) God's not here. He left a long time ago. We've always been alone, don't you know that? - I used to think like that, when my wife left, aw hell, when she... Kicked my confused ass out. - Why? - She felt like I, took everything from her. Maybe I did. I don't recall. - Well, either you did, or you didn't. You can't have it both ways. Great. Have a crappy life. - Are you ready? - [Jess] Yeah. - Follow me. (melancholic music) Alright. - Okay. - Right. Now, offer a prayer for your brother. Tell him anything you want. Whatever is in your heart. - [Jess] It's been a long time, Taylor. I hope that wherever you are now, you know you are loved and missed. I think about you all the time, and I hope that your spirit is at peace. - When you're done, set the incense in the sand. The smoke will waft and find your brother's spirit, bringing the food and prayers to him. - I don't know how to thank you for this, Takashi. Remembering him right now, it didn't hurt so much. I thought of all of the good moments we had. Where I would laugh so hard I'd cry because I was so incredibly happy. - I'm glad that you invited me in. - Where did you learn to handle death so well? Who died? - My father. He passed away last week, but, I never got to say goodbye to him. I will, I will perform the same ceremony for my father, but not now. - Is there anything I can do? - It is like you said. Death is hard to handle. Period. But time will help. - My brother loved to share. One of the best things about him. Maybe he could share the chicken waffles with your father. - Do you have any hot sauce? My father loved spicy food. So do I. My mother always said I get this from him. (Jess chuckles) - Yes, I'll be right back. (Takashi laughs) - That's actually my favorite. - [Otis] Weddings and funerals are reality checks. One contains the promise of a fresh start. The endless hope of a future together. The other is the slate being wiped clean. No words left to say. Nothing more to explain. - I am going to fuckin' miss you. - I proposed to my wife on this bridge. A long time ago. And when you're homeless, (chuckles) you spend a lot of time in the library. I picked up a few stories. - Really? - Out of all the jumpers, only one survived. A baby girl. Janette Ward. She didn't jump. Her mother, Mertelle, threw her over. That was in 1937, in the depth of the Great Depression. That poor woman thought she could spare her child a life full of suffering. That sound familiar? - How did she survive? - One of God's trees caught her in its branches. Saved her from a 15-story fall. Her mother, Mertelle, she wasn't so lucky. Some say she wanders the bridge at night, lookin' for her little Janette. - That's a good ghost story. I'm too old to be scared. - There's another spirit that haunts this bridge. The Man in Black, some say he's an undertaker. Out to usher the souls of the dead back to the old mortuary. Others say that he calls the people in crisis here to jump. - These are urban legends. I wasn't called here, I came on my own. - I came on my own, too. This is where I was the happiest. But not happy enough to jump into permanent residence. But, have it your way. Knock your socks off. But, uh, one favor, before you go. - Why're you takin' your shoes off? Is this some kind of Titanic moment? I go, you go, you plan on following me down? - Oh, hell no. You goin' down by yourself. No need to waste those shoes, though. How about you give 'em to me now? I don't want 'em messed up with your piss and shit. - Are you fucking kidding me? - Am I? You know what saved me when I hit rock bottom? He did. - Mm. - I took whatever faith, what little I had, and offered it up to God. - So God's the answer? - He is. You just have to believe him. He will guide you, if you let him. - Trust in him, huh? - Yes. You just have to surrender. - And he can save me? - Yes! Have mercy upon us. Forgive us our sins. All these little moments, tiny accidents that we overlook now, but later regret, propel us along, creating an intricate tapestry of our lives. And once in a while, we get a chance to make a difference. Even a small one. But I learned for it to work, you've got to have faith that all of this, everything and everyone, is connected. For better or for worse. That's up to us, our choice to make. - [Luke] So I just have to surrender. - [Otis] I mean, isn't that what it's all about?
