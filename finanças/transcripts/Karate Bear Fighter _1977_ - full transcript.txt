SHINICHI "SONNY" CHIBA YUTAKA NAKAJIMA YUMI TAKIGAWA JUN FUJIMAKI MASAYUKI YUHARA MASASHI ISHIBASHI MASUTATSU OYAMA Directed by KAZUHIKO YAMAGUCHI Masutatsu Oyama was expelled from Japan's karate circle. He trained hard, seeking the true art of karate by himself. He was trying to make his fists the world's strongest. 1951, RENSHINKAN GYM Is that your "harmless" karate? It can't hurt anything. I'm Funayama, 3rd grade of the Renshinkan Gym. Wait. No matches against him. He's the notorious karate fighter, Masutatsu Oyama. Why stop them? A fight that ends with blood is out of date. Karate is a clean sport to help young men grow up strong. Are you running away? I'll challenge you... No! If we accept your challenge, we'll be blamed. You scared? Oyama! You die here! "Karate Fighter Runs Wild Again!" "Is Karate a Weapon of Beasts?" More sake! Hurry, bring sake! What are you doing? Shut up! Shut up? Drink quietly. Oyama! It's me. Kimura? Is it you, Kimura? I didn't expect you'd recognize me. Imperial Air Force pilot turned gangster. You haven't changed. You only have karate. Always barreling ahead like a boar. That means you've made no progress. Honesty is no good. It got you expelled from the karate circle. Right? In this world, only smart guys survive. The Korean War, for instance. Some made a lot of money from it. Kimura, what are you trying to say? I want to live like a king in the underworld. Oyama, help me. You won't be sorry. I'm Oyama, karate champion of Japan. As you probably know... I fought against a bull and knocked it down barehanded. What made me so strong? Hard training and something else. This herb I found in the mountains. Take it for a month, and you'll be strong too. I named it Mankinko. It works miraculously. You can have it at cost. 50 yen! I'm buying. 50 yen, not expensive. What a fake! I'll fix him. We sold a lot. If you're Masutatsu Oyama, break this stone. What?! It's an easy job for Oyama. Don't try to push me, or you'll be sorry. What's this? Beat him. Don't look for trouble. - What are you doing? - Watch it! - He's Masutatsu Oyama! - I know... What?! Forgive me. I didn't know. I'm sorry! Apologize. No! Masutatsu Oyama is nobody now. - Shut up! - You shut up! I knew him as a karate expert. Not as a bouncer for a gang of musclemen. If we're cheap... ...so is Masutatsu Oyama! Just a moment. I'm sorry. He's crazy. I'm sorry. What's his name? Ohashi. I'll buy you a drink as a token of my apology. Welcome, Mr. Oyama. Come in. What's the matter? Close the door. Come in. Sumiko. Another rose? Madame. Look. He should think of something else. Who is this gentleman? Mr. Oyama teaches me karate. That's right, he's my pupil. Be nice to him. Look at her. She's the main attraction here. Beautiful. Too nice for a shop like this. Thank you. You're hurting me. Let go of me. That was rude! I have many other customers. Sit down! Apologize to him. Behave yourselves, men! Madame! Sumiko is being molested. Sumiko? I'd better go see. Where Sumiko is concerned, leave it to me. Be careful, they're karate experts. Don't worry, they're no match for Mr. Oyama. My eyes! - What's wrong? - I feel dizzy. Oyama. A bodyguard, huh? It suits you. Who's the new girl? That's Chiyako Fujimaki, a hostess for Americans. She speaks English. Bring that Scotch called Vallen or whatever. Clark seems to have a crush on Miss Fujimaki. He has good taste. By the way... ...will you tak her into being Clark's woman? To be his mistress in Japan. She'll serve only him. "Only"? It's a deal. You buy the whisky. What are you doing?! I apologized! Stop it, Ohashi! Get Oyama. What happened? He hit an important customer. Mr. Oyama. Chiyako! He apologized... ...but they treated him badly. Oyama! What are you doing? I don't like bullying. The landlord heard that you're in Ikebukuro. Why not come back to your apartment? I've been living there waiting for you. Why not tell me what's worrying you? I love you. But there's something... You love karate more. I know that much. But you've forgotten the spirit of karate. No. Yes! You can't take off your sunglasses at night. I heard you were peddling. I looked for you. The peddler was a fake. But you're a fake, too, of Masutatsu Oyama. Take off your sunglasses! Fool! The Americans were important customers. You worked him over and took the girl away. Why? Oyama, you were my buddy in the lmperial Air Force. So I'm taking care of you. Am I wrong? You mean you're doing me a favor? Of course. I thought I was helping you. You're like a dog that bites its master. You can't just walk out on me. You must die. All right. Stand up. That's all for today. Put out the fire. Wait, Oyama. Masutatsu Oyama? I'm Kanbe. I'm here to kill you. Die! He has a threatening air about him. - I'm back. - Welcome home. Did you see him? I wonder what he's doing? I'm sorry. I wonder where Oyama went? Chiyako. Chiyako. You'd better give him up... ...and marry me. Please. I know he'll come back to me someday. Chiyako! She's mean. What does she see in him? You're hurting me. Don't scratch me. How do you like the local food? - Very nice. - There's more. I hear you're going to Hokkaido. We'll take a trip for a week. Why not settle down there? Get married to Kozuru in his home town. That's impossible. Don't you want to marry her? I do, but... ...it's so sudden, I'm not ready. You're always ready. Propose to her. What are you saying? Look. She's embarrassed. Mr. Kozuru... If you're willing to accept me... Sumiko! Let's drink to their happiness. Old man. Please wait. Are you Mr. Gunji Uchiyama, master of rod fencing? Just an old man now. I can see a threatening air about you. A threatening air? I don't think so. Master... Instruct me. Try to beat me, if you can. I can 't attack, or even touch him. No chance. Why? What's wrong? I lost! Mr. Oyama, you're strong. Too strong. You should be weaker. You should withhold your strength. You felt a threatening air about me. But it was yourself. You were scared of your own reflection in me. My reflection? Your aggressiveness straightens your strength into a line. Your attack flowed away along the circle my stick drew. After all, a line is subject to the movement of a circle. What's the "circle"? "The movement of a circle"? Goodbye, Tokyo. I was an orphan. I was lonely and unhappy. Fortune never smiled on me. Sumiko, I'll make you happy. I have a dream. I'll have a farm at the foot of Mt. Daisetsu, Hokkaido. I'll buy some cows and milk them everyday. Leave it to me. Welcome home. It's been a long time, brother. I just got back today. Come this way. Did you train hard in Okinawa? Have a drink. Brother, this is no time for drinks. I hear Oyama insulted our school. Why did you hire killers? Why didn't you challenge him to a duel? He's been an outcast. If I fight with him, it'll degrade me. People will laugh at me. I never thought you'd talk like a woman. Oyama is pretending he's strong. He can't do much. You think too much of him. Don't you believe you can beat him? What?! That's an insult. Shut up! What a bunch of cowards! You're all scared of him. You behave badly! I don't ever want to see you again! These are the last bottles. Come here and pour me a drink. You're going to Hokkaido? No use marrying a punk like him. I'm sorry! Oyama's here! Ryudoji, stand up! Oyama, I did it in self-defense. Shut up! Brother! He will live. But... his body... I'll get revenge! I'll send Oyama to hell with these hands! Listen. Don't let the world know about this. It's shameful. My brother was injured in an accident, that's all. All right. I'll train you in his place. Line up! I'm the boss now. I'll train you hard, unlike my brother. HOKKAIDO Where's the sake?! Rintaro! I asked where the sake is! What's this? What are these?! Urns! How did you get them? Nobody gives me sake on credit. No money, no sake. So you stole the bag?! Rintaro, who told you to steal? Daddy, forgive me! I told you... ...to buy sake on credit, didn't I? But you stole these urns! Damn brat! Who are you? Daddy, the bag belongs to him. You want to drink, so you make your son act like a thief? What a father! Shut up! You broke into my house. I'm free to have my son work for me. Get out! Get lost! If you want a fight, come on. I'll see what you can do. All right... ...I'll kill you! Daddy! You can fight all right. If you want to drink, work. You can work. Shame on you! What are you doing to him? Let go of him! You love your drunken father? Of course! I see. - Daddy! - Rintaro! Kozuru. Sumiko. You 're now at the foot of Mt. Daisetsu. Rest in peace. Wow! What's your father doing? He's at work. Work? Cutting down trees. So he got a job. That's great! Eat the fish. It's good. Naturally. It's the season for trout. Rintaro, where's your mother? Dead. She'd been ill for a year. Daddy nursed her day and night. He started drinking after she died. He's lonely. Don't let it beat you. You're a man. A man should be strong. When I was your age... ...I had no parents. I was lonely. Loneliness almost beat me. That's why I started this. What's "this"? - Karate. - Karate? Yes. Nobody can beat me at karate. But I can't fight the coward in me with karate. Rintaro, every man has a weakness. He has to fight the coward in himself all his life. Understand? Rintaro, it's terrible! Your father was hit by a falling tree. He's going to die. - Why not take him to the hospital? - He has no money. Once we get hurt, we're finished. His arms hurt, but he kept working. - Arms? - Yes. So he swung his axe and missed. All right. I'll give you money. But you must risk your life. You killed a bull barehanded. Try a bear this time. A bear? We caught one a week ago. A bear is a fierce animal. If you win, you'll get the money as a prize. If you lose, you'll lose your life too. You have a week to get ready. Excuse me. What is it? Please look at this newspaper. "Karate Death Match against Bear!" He's so desperate for fame. He escaped to Hokkaido. I never thought of it. Can he beat a bear? Not unless it's a trick. It's the end of Masutatsu Oyama. He asked for it. But I hope he'll win the match. His life should end... ...by my hands. How's the bear? It hasn't eaten all night. It'll kill him quickly. Are you ready? Hey! Release the bear! Uncle! Uncle! Win! Uncle! He won! Auntie! Auntie! He won! Uncle! Tell him I went home. When my mind was clear of thoughts, I killed the bear. Is this the movement of a circle? I hear your father's recovering from the operation. He'll be released soon. That's great! What's the matter with your hand? What happened? Does it hurt? It's nothing. The bear scratched me a little. The doctor applied some ointment. Stay here until you get well. When you get well, let's go fishing again. You promise, right? All right. I won't go away. Why are you leaving? You said you wouldn't go away. Don't go! Stop! It's dangerous! Stop! Uncle, you're a fool! Fools! Lay off! This is my duel. I'm stiff. I have to loosen up. Relax, boy. Are you crazy? Or scared? He 's wasting energy. When he stops, it's my chance. Now! A circle is a mind without thoughts. The power of nothingness. That's what the old man meant.
