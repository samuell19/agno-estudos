This is my fiancé, Ahmed. I can barely talk to him. Oh, he's so handsome. May God bring him back safely. - My son's name's Ahmed. - Really? - Yes. - Do you have other children? - Yes, Mostafa and Manal. - God bless them all. You too dear. He's an army officer in Sinai. - I'm always worried about him. - Of course! Whenever I see clashes on TV, I get way too anxious. Of course! - I will wait till after the finals. - We are a couple of days away. Not really, my school is different. Where do you study? - Medical school in Zagazig. - Oh, God bless. You're a doctor! Yes. - I come from a long family of doctors. - God bless. They doubted my ability to study medicine but I told them I won't be less than anyone. Where is your engagement ring? We didn't have time to celebrate, cause he got called for duty. So we agreed to do it when he's back. During school break, should I stay with his family in Ismalia or with my aunt in Mansoura? - You should go to his family. - Really? Yes, so that you get used to them. - I feel shy. - You shouldn't. - Does he have a sister? - Yes. - Then you should be friends. - We're actually very close. She always talks to me, and texts me on social media. So don't be shy. You're already part of the family. Ahmed says his family likes me a lot. He says his family had been praying for a good wife for him, and God has answered. - You're adorable, and I'm sure they like you. - Thank you. It's all because of his sister! - She's in her thirties, and not married yet. - Oh... She always nags about whatever I do. Whenever he gets me a gift, he also gets her something to shut her up. - What does he do? - He's a surgeon in Cairo. - God bless, God bless. - Is it my fault that I'm with a doctor?! No, of course not! I told him I want nothing from you, I just want to know you better. You're right. I asked him to come over frequently, Zagazig is not that far. We need to know each other. Be patient, and wise. And how do you feel now? Sometimes I'm fine, and sometimes I feel like dumping him. It seems you're not praying properly. You should pray right before going to bed and see how'd you feel after you wake up. Don't chat with your girlfriends on Facebook, or WhatsApp. I don't. I pray and then I sit with my family for a while. Don't even talk to your family. Trust me, people are jealous! Even your close ones. I totally rely on God in everything. I have strong faith. You're absolutely right. Yet, my advice is not to confine in anyone, and just keep praying. - God will help me. - I'm sure. You are late! Get your bag and let's go. I've been waiting, and I refused to go home with Toka out of respect to you! Rabab, it was out of my hand! The bus was slow, and then it stopped. I had to look for another one, and that took a lot of time. And I was stranded in the sun as well! - Bring your bag, and let's go! - I can't handle you anymore! Shut it. Watch your mouth! - How was your exam? - It's done. - How was it? - None of your business. Rabab, what's wrong with you! I did well. Leave me alone! If you really did well, you would've looked happy. I did well, just leave me. Rabab don't be mad at me. You know what... I swear on the holy Quran, if you get good grades... I'll get you a beautiful gift. - Oh yeah, I believe you. - Trust me I will. SOUAD - Lemon makes you brighter. - Brightens the skin, or the mind? Wessam, it fits you! No, it's to brighten the pussy. Do you know what's a black pussy? - Yeah, it's the one you have. - No, it's like yours my dear. - I meant the skin tone. - Look how different my skin tone is, Amira! I told you before I need your help. - It's because you are black inside out Wessam. - Shut up, black bitch! - Listen, go with the lupin beans. - Yeah, grinded lupin. I know that! And add lemon and honey, it will brighten your skin - Look, they're wearing Hijab and dancing! - What kind of Hijab is this! That's shameful! - Respectful girls don't do these things - Oh yeah, you're right they don't... They do more than that! - Do you want to do like them? - Yeah, why not. What is that?! Oh, I got it with my mom. It's for my dowry. So why is it on the bed now? Are you warming up? It's very nice, but what's this hole? I was just checking its fabric. You said you wanted to pray 2 hours ago. Yeah right, I have to pray. Why don't you pray? Do you want to pray with me Souad? - I'm on my period. - Really? Stop it! - What about you? - I'm on my period as well. Let's celebrate the period day! - Girls, you really need to pray. - Really? - Yes. It brings huge blessings. - Why is that? - Don't you love our Prophet? - Indeed, God Bless His Soul. The Prophet once said: "If you love me, you should follow my steps". Oh, I'm touched! Now I have goosebumps all over my body! Let's go! - Thank you. - You're welcome. Wait, aren't you buying anything? - You're pissing me off! - Shut up, and let's go Rabab. What a bummer!! How old is he? How would I know? He looks older, and Radwa is pretty. Why would she accept it? It's her destiny. That's strange! No, it's not. He's smart and rich. She goes to medical school, so she should end up with someone like him. Is he a doctor? None of your business. Get aside to let me sit. You'll burn me! Told you to get aside! I don't know how you can stand this! I like it. Won't it burn you! No, it won't "burn" me! Do you remember that Study Center we used to go to? Yes. There was this dark corner, behind the building. I don't know, I didn't notice it. Anyway, I'll tell you... He took me there. I asked him if I could try a cigarette. I kept coughing after the first puff. Then he pushed me to the wall, and kissed me! He's a really good kisser. - Did you let him kiss you? - Yes I did! - How come? - Just like that. Why are you surprised? He just did it. But I thought he liked me! Who is this? - Is this Ahmed? - Yes. - Show me. - He just posted a new video. He's sexy Souad! I stopped talking to him. Why? He even has a nice name! - Where does he live in Alexandria? - Ibrahimia. - In the avenue next to the train station... - I know it, I know it. He says his mom met his dad in a street fight. Yeah, street fights can be a real turn-on! He says his mom cursed his dad in the fight and that's when he decided to marry her! So strange! He came to my college once, but I didn't go out to meet him. - Why did you do that? - I felt he's not serious. He waited for 2 hours, and we kept texting all the while. Then he got bored, and decided to leave. But I didn't come out to meet him. Ahmed, I don't want to talk to you again. You never reply back, yet you're online and I'm sure you read my messages. You should've had the guts, and told me that you want to end it. It's my mistake that I've shared my photos with you. Please delete them all! You should've had the guts, and told me that you want to end it. I won't call you again. It's my mistake that I've shared my photos with you. Please delete them all! Get out of the room Rabab. Are you going to pray? No, I'll dance! I won't make any noise. Get out!! I'm glad they've left us a space to walk in this city! I'll keep this one short. I just came back from shooting a TV Ad in a beautiful village... I would like to thank Mr. Nasser. He showed us what does it mean to be a true villager. Real generosity that you can't get from people living in a city. He kept feeding us, though we're causing a mess with our equipment. Beautiful people, with beautiful souls... Once again, thank you Mr. Nasser. And I have to admit, People living in the suburbs are nicer than people living in urban cities. Check this out‚ at last, I can see the beach! I've been walking for an hour, the Corniche is full of... Leave this and wash the pot. I saw them coming back. - Do you know when is the wedding? - No. I just saw them now. Were they carrying furniture? I don't know. I saw big boxes, chandeliers, and carpets. Listen, you're not like her. You're naive and you'll remain naive! She's different! Anyway, I really wish her good... I have nothing against her. Here you go. Move this away from here. Make tea. And get some cookies for me. Okay. Go move the TV. Where is your sister? Still sleeping. - Till now? - Yes. Let her rot! - Where is he? - Who's calling? - Are you the rabbit? - No, I'm the cat. No problem, I'm here to eat anything. Stop it... Stop it. Stop it! - What have you done to me in the morning? - Stop it... Aunty is coming next week? - Do you want me to imitate her? - Can you? What are you wearing young lady? Do you want to go out like this? You're almost naked! Go wear something long. - This is long Aunty! - Long how! Are you kidding? You have to wear a proper Hijab. This colorful piece of clothes is nothing! Are you trying to fool God? This curtain is forbidden! The mobile you're using is forbidden! - This lamp is forbidden! - Oh my God... You're nasty! Hello? Hi Ahmed. - Switch off the flashlight! - Wait a second. I swear I didn't want to answer! You kept asking for my photos, and when you got them you started your bullshit! By the way, I knew you were going to do this! Really? If you do this again, I swear I won't talk to you again! Actually your videos are becoming boring! Seriously, quite boring! At the beginning they were interesting, but that's not the case anymore. I'll unfollow you, and I'll look for someone else who cares! All your photos are crap. What!! Mine are crap?! No, yours are shit! I want to show you something. Hold-on... Who's prettier, me or her? Okay‚ I got it! No it's okay, you don't need to explain. Really?! Well, I'm talking about her face. You're looking somewhere else! Stop it! What's that? Didn't I tell you to delete those?! You're just bluffing Ahmed... Stop bluffing! Really?! "You know if you are in front of me, wearing this shirt, I would've..." What would you have done? You can't do anything! Oh my God, stop it! What else? I would've kissed you... Your neck... Your chin... Then I'd go down on your whole body... Bit by bit... Ahmed! Ahmed! I want to tell you something! Please don't disappear again! Otherwise, I'll never talk to you again Did I get you out of the mood? - My dear, those are not fresh at all! - This is the best I could do. Well your dad won't eat it, and he'll throw it in your face. - What do you want to buy? - Fresh lettuce. - Good morning. - Good morning. - How much is the lettuce? - Free for you. - Thank you dear. 6 for 10? - For you, it's 5 for 10. - Okay, get me good ones. - Sure. - How can I cook this? - This one is good. - Consider me a bad cook! - I'm a good cook. I'll do it for you. Well, you're a good seller. You sold me what you want. Goodbye. - You're giving away your family's clothes! - We don't use them anymore. Aren't these your brother's when he was fat? He was a bit chubby. - No, he was obese. - He was a bit chubby. In my eyes, he's smart and handsome! Leave this now, and sit with us for a while. - This used to look nice on you girl! - I don't wear such clothes anymore. Take it if you want. No, I have a lot of sexy stuff. I don't need yours. Let's sit and chat. - I want to see the new thing that you got. - It's there on the balcony. - What is it? - I got a new blender. You don't need to know everything. She's crazy. Oh, I was about to fall! Apparently someone has an evil eye!! I wonder who! Wait... You don't have nails to open this. I'm trying to help. Look at my beautiful nails! - Where did you get it from? - From Tafahna. His mom got it for you? No, I paid for it. It's much cheaper there. She just delivered it to me, because I couldn't carry it all the way. Oh, are you still talking to that guy? The young Sheikh? - His mom is pushing you to accept him? - No, she's not. She's just being nice to me. I just go to his lessons in the mosque, and I leave afterwards immediately. Stop it. The guy is interested in you. It's so clear from the way he looks at you! Nonsense! - Do you have him on Facebook? - Now she's shy! He added me, but I didn't accept. Why? And why would I? There is nothing to talk about. How would he even know it's you? You don't have a Facebook photo, and you're hidden! He's a respectful man, and he's not into social media crap. Why are you laughing? You used to hide on Facebook as well. Not anymore! - Look how beautiful we were! - Move away, let me see. You have a lot of photos for this engagement party. Move!! It was nice. We look really pretty here. Your dress was beautiful. - It was tight, and I'll never wear it again. - Why? It is really tight. Well, I thought you'll wear it to Radwa's wedding. I don't know, no one invited us yet. We also didn't get an invitation yet . - Your ass was so curvy Amira! - Stop it, girl! We all looked sexy. - Yes, we looked very good. - Move away. What? Let's try it in the kitchen! Oh my God, I have hair all over my arm! I told you, I can remove it for you. Don't you wax? Not a lot. Aren't you going to Alexandria? I don't think so. - Why? - I'm worried about my grades. - Why don't you go for just one day? - Amira, aren't you going to Alexandria? I can't. My brother, Adel, is here, and I need to stay to cook for him. - My dear brother, Adel. - My dear love, Adel. - I'll go talk on the phone. - Okay. Yeah please, leave us alone. - I will leave you alone Wessam! - Good, give us some air space! Wessam says you have a crush on my brother, Adel. No Way! How dare she! He's like a brother to me. How could you let her say these things! She's the one with the crush. She has a crush on them all. - Souad, I don't like the way you talk! - Really?! But you love how she talks! Why didn't you defend me? She doesn't mean it. Also we saw you standing with him without your Hijab! I was just saying hi. I treat him like a brother, Amira. Enough, Souad! You always believe her. No I don't, she was just joking. You know that she smokes and drinks. She's a whore! Souad, what's wrong with you? She's your friend, you can ask her. - Don't cry. - I'm not. I'm just worried about my exams' results. Are they released? No, not yet. May God help you! Don't worry, you'll pass. And we'll go to Alexandria together. You're an asshole! I keep calling you, Wessam. Why don't you pick up? Don't remove it. You've messed it up. Hold this. Wait, wait! Hold this! So you look sexy! - Take another one. - Show both of your shoulders. The other one. Take another picture from the back. Look! Here... Very nice one! Take another, show my face in it I won't show him... - Who's him? - No one. Don't tell Mom. - She'd kill me! - Yes. You have big lips. - Watch out! - Move your lips. Fix it. Dumb! It looks really nice, right? - Yes - Let's take a selfie. I told Toka I might go to the school trip I'm counting on you to convince Dad. Toka is afraid of being alone; She always wants me... I don't know how she'll... I might go to her this afternoon... I forget it with her while studying. It's hot. I'm thirsty. Should I get you some water? Are you thirsty? Calm down, calm down. Come on, Nagwa... Calm down. It's God's will. - Calm down, she's in a better place. - It's God's will. She's now a bride in Heaven. Someone help me! - We can't object God's will. - We can't mention God's name in the toilet! Hold her with me, Rabab. RABAB Do you need help? No I'm done. She was untouched (virgin). God bless her soul. She's now a bride in Heaven. Yes, it's exactly what happened to Khalida. Yes, she was fixing the curtain, and then she fell off the balcony. Yes, it was diabetes but she was rescued cause it was the 2nd floor. Thank you, Kawthar. Thank God. No, no, she was perfect. Yes, Rabab is inside doing the laundry. Thank God, how are you? Good. Yeah, the forensic report says she was untouched (virgin). Thank God. It's her destiny. Yeah, it's her destiny. We won't object God's will. There is no strength save in God. No don't come. The house is small. God only knows what's hidden, Hassan. Fine. Okay. I will... She's always sleeping. Pray for her. I left you food in the fridge! I'll talk to Kawthar. - Abdallah! Abdallah! - What? Hassan wants to talk to you. Hello! Yeah, we finished everything. Thank God. It didn't take much time. Don't worry Hassan I know you're busy. Thank God. We can't object God's will. Who got her this mug? Perhaps her friends for her birthday. - Who exactly? - Maybe Amira and Wessam. Tell me... Was Souad seeing someone? Seeing? - I mean dating. - No! - No one? - No! Aunty... Is Souad going to Hell? Why do you say so? Cause I heard God punishes those who do what she did. Pray for her dear, pray and read a lot of Quran. No one knows what really happened Rabab. She just called me 2 days ago Asking for food recipes! And told me she'd prepare some when I visit. God is great (Praying) Open this thing. Open her Facebook account. Go do whatever you were doing! Why are you doing this? My dear, it's better to donate her stuff. We're seeking mercy from God. You don't want her stuff to trigger Nagwa. It's all for God my dear. No! What? - I want this! - Okay. - Give me her mobile. - No, I want to keep it. Ladies and gentlemen! Tonight, Hisham, my dear doorman, who sleeps all day long, Decided today to do his job, and stay awake! Why? Cause we want to kiss upstairs! - Stop it! - I'm upset. We've been driving all over Alexandria looking for a place to kiss. - Just one single kiss! - Stop it! It's unbelievable! We drove for 3 hours! Wherever we go, we find lights! Everybody is on the street! A conspiracy against kissing! Listen listen... Since we're already here... And we've got nothing to do... And we want to kiss... Let's just kiss here! - Stop it! - No, no... Stop it! - Yara, Yara... Just one kiss! - Stop it, stop it! - Give me the phone! - No, no! - Wait, just wait... - No! One kiss, Yara!

You don't have work today? What? - Thank you. - You're welcome. Please. So, Souad left something for me? Yes, but I can't give it to you now. - When was that? - 2 month ago. - She was supposed to come here then! - I don't know. - Is this Souad's mobile? - How did you know? I saw it with her in a photo. Are we close to Stanley bridge? Not really. Can we go? - Are you meeting someone there? - No, I just want to go. - Sure. Let's go. Shall we go? - Where are you staying tonight? - I'm not staying. Rabab, was Souad talking to you? About? Her problems, life? Sometimes... Was she talking to you? Yeah, but just about simple stuff. She said she was worried about her grades. Yeah, but she actually passed in all exams. Really?! Rabab, what happened? I saw it on Facebook, but I didn't get it. - She fell down. - How? She just fell from the balcony. I'm sorry to hear that. You know how much she was dear to me. - What's wrong? - Stomach ache! - What did you eat for breakfast? - Nothing. You had coffee on an empty stomach? I don't know what to do! - Do you want to go to the toilet? - Yes! I need to use the toilet. No, no need to talk to her. It's just that... She's my mom. I don't want her to be alone at home. Don't worry, I won't be late. But I need to stay with my mother. Okay. Okay, okay. Bye-bye. Souad had a much better hair! Better than whom? Better than that girl you were looking at! Okay. I mean when she used to take off her Hijab. I'm not as pretty as her, I look like my dad. - You're pretty! - Not like her. Would I look good in Hijab? Are you planning to wear it? I should, next year. I haven't decided yet. Would I look good? Sure! I'm a bit hungry. - So, what did Souad leave for me? - Not now. I'll give it to you at 7 pm. Are you sure your parents know you're here? I told you yes they do! Why did you ask Souad to stop talking to you? - I never did that. - Yes you did. She asked you not to talk to her again, then you said "that would be better". Listen... Souad and I... We used to fight... And... How do you get all these likes on Facebook? I don't know. People like what I write and post. I like to write as well. What kind of writings? - Personal diaries, but not to be shared. - Personal diaries?! - Good that you're not posting them! - I will soon! Do you live nearby? No, I live at Ibrahimia. Do you live in a villa? No. Sea view? No, just a normal apartment. No, I'm busy now. Okay. Okay, okay, I'll... Okay, finish your part and I'll let you know once I'm done. Don't worry. Okay okay... Bye. Bye. Let's go. - You can leave if you're busy. - Come on! I've got a lot to do, and I still need to drop you off. - Go do your stuff, and I'll wait for you. - Here alone in the street! No way! Listen, I'll drop you off at the station. - No... - I'm getting a taxi. Don't worry. Let's get this done, and give me what she left for me! Not now, at 7pm! - Rabab, l'm done! - Done with what? It's over! Is my mobile with you? I can't find it! - What mobile? I don't have it. - I lost my phone. Look for it, because I can't find it! Taxi is 1 minute away. - Check if my mobile's with you! - What mobile? Your mobile? - Yes, my mobile! Who else? - I'm sure it's in your pocket! I can't find it. Check if it's with you! - What do you want me to do? - Look for it! Do you think I stole it? - Stop being silly, and help me! - You stop it! - I'm not leaving without my phone! - Don't you ever touch me! - I'm not leaving! - The car is here. I'm telling you it's not with me! You're driving me crazy! - Go now, go go... - No, don't push me! You'll find it in your bag. - I looked! - Please drop her off at the train station. Come on, go, go! Look in your bag. You'll find it. I've paid for the trip. Goodbye. Next train is at 4 am. - What about the one at 7 pm? - It's in the schedule... This is the old schedule. - Listen, there is a bus leaving at 9 pm. - No, that would be too late. I can't be at home after 11 pm. Yes Dad. I'm good. No, we haven't started yet. We're still shopping, we have a lot to do. We'll start around 7pm. She's asking me to sleepover. I'll let you know if I will. How's Mom? Okay... Bye-bye. What is it that starts at 7 pm? My friend's birthday. You're supposed to be there now? Yes! - Where does she live? - In our neighborhood. What if he called her? You're asking too much! Are you an engineer? I hold the degree, but never practiced it. So what do you do? Content creator for social media... Facebook, Instagram, TikTok. I make videos and I write. - I make a lot of things. - Oh right, I saw your videos! Really?! What do you think of them? - I didn't like them! - Why? A lot of blabbering. - Hey, how are you? - What a surprise! - What's up? - All is good. - Lina, how are you? - How are you? I'm good. Rabab, my colleague's sister. Khalid, and Lina; my friends. - How's it going? - Good. - What's up? - All is good. - How's Yara? - Busy with her work. - You saw Dalia's exhibition? - No, I'm not into art. I saw Yara over there. She attended the Q&A, and even asked! Oh God! That's a sign to break up with her. - Okay, we'll see you around. - Bye. Rabab! Rabab! Where are you going? - Where are you going? - None of your business! - Why didn't you say that I'm Souad's sister? - They don't know Souad. Why? And who's Yara? Yara... Yara... Yara is my girlfriend. Your girlfriend? What about Souad? - What? - What? She told you she loved you, and you said‚ I love you too. I used to love her... Of course, I loved her. Listen... Throw a coin and make a wish. It might come true. Really? What was it? I want her to go to Heaven. The same wish? I don't want to fall in love. - How long will it take you? - 2 hours maximum. Her dad might ask me to stay longer. - Bye for now. - Bye-bye. Not everybody knows the Taymour Mango. The real one with a fruity taste. - Before, we had different kinds of mangos. - There still are. Yeah, but not like before. - Ahmed doesn't eat mango. - What?! - You don't drink mango juice? - At all? - I mean I could eat it. - You could eat it? Are you kidding? Mango is quite important... It's good for your health. Oh, there are many benefits in it. What did you do with your summer house? Don't remind me... I love it! But she doesn't, and she doesn't, and even he doesn't! So usually I go there alone! They want me to sell it, and get a new one in a remote area, close to Libya! - It's called Rass... - El Hikma! Rass El Hikma! Listen to this! - Oh, it's a beautiful area. - It's beautiful, right? Look at how skinny you are? Do you even eat? You see! I'm not the only one saying that! Okay... We're worried about you honey! I do eat well. I never see you with a dish! Some meat, some chicken... You don't know what food is like! - Everyone we know goes there... - So they want me... So they want me to go far away, and pay a lot of money for a tiny house! - Not all of them are this small. - 90% of them are. It's unbelievably expensive, I don't get it! Why would I go that far, and pay millions for a tiny house with no sea view! Everybody believes it's a nice place, and it's only you who's arguing! My opinion is the only one that matters, cause I'm the one who's paying! Honestly, I think you should sell your house, cause it's really old. It's quite cold. - Do you want to sit somewhere? - No, it's okay. I've never been out this late. Hold on a second. Hi babe. I'm still busy with my mom. I'm sorry, I'll call you when I'm done. Did you enjoy the gathering? No. - Are you always like this? - Like what? Always looking at girls? - I didn't look at anyone. - You did! - I didn't look at anyone. - You did, I saw you... Stop lying! Look who's talking! Come here! - Hey... Stop looking! - What? What do you mean what? Do you want to take a selfie with him? No, I want to take a selfie with you! Okay. - And I want you to post it! - Why should I? - Why not? You post a lot of photos. - Yeah, but that's work. Those silly posts are all for work? Come on! Okay, come next to the sea. Nice one. Now it's posted. Thank you. Your girlfriend won't get mad at you? If she did... Would you be my girlfriend? Let's go! So your family is from Sharkia? My dad is, but mom is from Banha. Your dad is, but your mom's from Banha. - You? - All my ancestors are from Alexandria. What does your dad work? He used to teach in Kuwait, then he came back, and joined a company. Doing what? A manager! Managing what? - I don't know! - You just know that he manages! You know, my mom met my dad in a street fight. She was cursing him in the street... A true Alexandrian woman! So you read all the messages that I've sent her? Was she talking to anyone else? Yes. The way she talks to me? How old is Yara? My age. Do you have a photo of her? Pretty. Why did you tell Souad that you love her? Because I did love her. But you love Yara! Yes. I wanted to see Souad. I went to her college one day. We kept chatting for 2 hours, but she never came out to see me. - I hope she's happy now. - I hope so too. Let's pray for her. Can I ask you for a favor? Kiss me... You promised Souad you'd kiss her on the beach. You live alone? Yes, but... My family owns the building. They live downstairs. Hello? Hi Dad. I was sleeping. Okay. How's Mom? Thank God. Yeah, I'll sleepover. I'll be home in the early morning. Okay. Bye-bye. All is good? Yes. No brothers, or sisters? Nope! - So you'll live here with your future wife? - That's the plan. What music is this? I'll keep it low. What are you doing? Rolling a cigarette. If my aunt was here, she would've gone crazy! Why, is she a doctor? - No. - So? Let me show you... Are you smoking Ahmed? Your health! You must be joking! To hell with the money! It's your health! You are joking! What would you benefit out of this! You're just buffing! Oh mighty God! Such a spoiled generation!! - Are you teasing me! - I'm sorry Aunty. - Your aunty must be exhausting. - Yes, she is! Do you want me to imitate Souad? Yes. Okay. Hold this. I told you before not to use my mobile. Why don't you listen to me?! Ask me first and I give it to you! You don't listen to me. You can't take it now, cause I want it. Hello... I didn't want to talk to you again. Yes. You've started bluffing, since I sent you my photos. Yes. My photos are not cool enough? You think yours are? Come sit down. It's ok, calm down... 10 minutes to go. Do you want to drink anything? No. Not even coffee? No, it's fine. She has beautiful hair. - Yara? - Yes. You too have a nice hair. Open your Bluetooth. I'll send you something. It's now open. - Which one? - This one. (A Song) He's the man I love He has beautiful dark eyes Oh my lonely nights, I'm sleepless... ... Listening to his sweet words, sweet words... (Souad's Voice) I won't send it to you now. I'll send it to you later... When I feel like it.
