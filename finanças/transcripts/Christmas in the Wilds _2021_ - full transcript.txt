The herald angels sing ♪ ♪ Glory to the newborn King! ♪ Jess, where's the fire? Too quick for you? No. But I am in no rush to get back to Thanksgiving craziness. Yeah, I'll second that. I have everything that I'm thankful for right here. I did not peg you for an expert snowmobiler? Wait till you see me on skis. And snowshoes. And I can build a pretty mean snowman. How did I not know that about you? You know, a true lady always preserves an air of mystery. Too late for that. I already know how amazing you are. Come on. We're sticking to trails this time! Oh come on, Buck Thompson. Take off your Ranger hat for a minute. You're off duty! It's spectacular, right? Definitely. I love this. When the temperature drops, the stalactites aggregate and beautiful crystal formation. I'll be studying the physical underlying structure of this land. Geology rocks! Geology puns? We've been having a lot of fun, Jess, these last few months but... That was rock bottom. Although getting to know you has made me want to be boulder. Oh! I'm impressed with that one. Thank you. It really is beautiful. Every time I take a deep breath, and my lungs freeze, I respect how dangerous it is out here. Well, we should probably get back. Your Mom is never going to warm up to me if we're late for Thanksgiving. Mom is going to warm up to you. Store-bought apple pie notwithstanding. Everyone knows it's pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving. I don't! I don't know these things! Are your big city Thanksgivings too posh for pies? No! No, it's not... My family is just a little less traditional. Mom's just been hard to connect to ever since Dad died. She's even more protective of her traditions. Well, you're still really lucky to have such a tight-knit family. I'm just not really sure how I fit in. You're doing pretty good so far. - Really? - Uh huh. Once they get to know you like I do, they're going to love you. Do you want to maybe spend Christmas together? We can go somewhere, just the two of us. Spend a few hours by a fireplace? Yeah. My uncle's got a cabin near Howler's Bay. Maybe. We will see. I mean, we don't have to spend Christmas together if you don't want to. In my line of work, I can't make plans. Accidents, natural disasters, they don't really happen on schedule. I just don't want to let you down. I'm crazy about you. And I'm lucky to spend any day with you, Christmas or not. Okay. Okay. - Hey Mom! Hey! Oooh! These are for you. Oh honey, these are beautiful! Thank you. Beautiful. I thought maybe you could put them on the table, in memory of Dad. Oh, that's really thoughtful of you. - Thanks. - Of course. Okay, let me have it. What's the plan for this year? Well you get to guess. Okay, um... Small to large? Nope. Ah... Shiny? No. Well, a little. Antique? No. - Vintage? - No. Okay. I'll tell you. In honor of my Scottish heritage, I thought we'd go with plaid-chic. I love it. It's genius Mom. It took me awhile to paint all of these, but... Hang on. You hand-painted these? I did. Of course you did. I had nothing else to do. Decorate. - They look great. - Thank you. I'm really happy you're here helping me with this. Gosh, it's too bad you have to work the holiday shift today. I know. I'm sorry. It's just, it's my turn. You know who's going to eat everything in sight? Oh yeah. - Buck? - Yes! Can you just put a plate aside for me? I will. Oh! Good idea. Okay. Oh my step ladder. It already looks great. It does! Hey! Aunt Janine says dinner's up in ten. Last one there is a rotten eggnog! Yeah, you'll smell like Pyrite! What? It's a rock. Smells like sulfur! I like the joke! You know what? I'm walking. Then I'm walking too! Well then you're going to be a rotten eggnog! I'd rather be with you. We'll find some time for us. Just you and me. I promise. Maybe we could go for a walk after dinner. It's the Leonid meteor shower tonight. Should be pretty spectacular. - It's a date. - Okay! ♪ ♪ So that's what the Thompson family sounds like. ♪ ♪ ♪ Deck the halls with balls of holly ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la la la Come on Jess, take it away! Oh, uh... ♪ 'Tis the season to be jolly! ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la la la la la! ♪ Don we now our gay apparel ♪ Fa la la la la la la la la! Okay you guys. Everybody sit down. Janine, this looks incredible. Oh, thank you. T'was nothing. Um, she has been preparing for weeks! Everything on this table has been grown, gathered and hunted by Aunt Janine. Really? What can I say? My family deserves the best. Well, every dish smells amazing! Thank you. We did really well this summer with the gardens. Finally we were able to pick more than the wildlife could eat. What does your family like to make for Thanksgiving? Nothing nearly as impressive as this. If you think this is impressive, wait to see what she does at Christmas. Surely Jessica's parents will want to see her at Christmas. Well, actually, my family has never been big on celebrating "commercial holidays". The town is honoring my Dad with a Christmas Eve service this year. Candlelight Christmas Eve service. I just want to say how special it is to have my family here with me. It's another Thanksgiving without Walter, but as I look into each of your eyes, and of course Roma, I can really feel that he's here with us. Sorry, Mom. No worries. Is everything okay? It's Avalon County. It's an emergency. Wayne Rangers to Avalon. Buck? If you can hear me... This is Buck Thompson. Go ahead. It's Meg Rogers up in Avalon Pass. Meg? Long time. What's going on? Level two avalanche. I've got skiers trapped somewhere out there. Current weather? Visibility is low. Storm is pressing in. My team is stretched thin. We could really use your expertise. I'm on my way. Over. Avalon has had a level two. I'm sorry but, I have to go. What's a level two? It's an avalanche. I'll call Roma. Get her ready. Not yet. Let me assess on the ground what rescue efforts they need and if they need air support. Meg and I have worked together before. We've got a shorthand. I'm going to need you to cover for me while I'm away. Meg. Who's Meg? Let me pack you some food. No time. Duty calls. Honey, you need to eat something! You're the one who taught me to live a life in service of others. Everything's good. Excuse me. This is Buck Thompson. I need my plane ready to go down at the hangar. Thank you. Do you think there will be more avalanches? It's always a possibility. You'll be safe in your plane, though, right? This isn't my first avalanche. I know. On a scale of one to ten, how dangerous is it? I don't know. Best-case scenario, I could be back in a few hours. Worst-case? There's never been a worst-case scenario that I haven't been about to get myself out of. And I don't intend to. But... Jess, Rescue Services is the life I've chosen. You're my girlfriend. I need you to understand. I have to go. Wait! Take this. A geologist with a lucky rock. What's it mean? It's a meteorite. That little hunk of rock is what started my fascination with geology. And yes, it's my lucky rock. Be safe. Come back to me. I will. So where was I? Um... Cheers. To us ladies, to lost loves and realities. Now dig in. Please. Don't worry. Buck is an excellent pilot. With years of experience with search and rescue under his belt. I know. It's just hard to turn the worry off. You learn how to live with it. Pass the potatoes, please. Sure. And don't worry about Buck. If he's with Meg, he has absolutely nothing to worry about. Who is Meg? Did they serve together? No, Meg and Roma served together in Afghanistan. And Buck and Meg were co-pilots in the Avalon Pass. Carrots? Co-pilots? Yeah. Beets? Sure. The Buck Thompson! Ted. I didn't realize Meg was calling in the big guns. It's good to see you. Likewise, brother. I only wish it was under better circumstances. Prep the dogs and stand by. Fueled up and ready to go. That's why you're the best. The skiers are experienced. They have a transceiver, but we haven't located the signal yet. If they've been pushed off the trail they could be anywhere down here. Hopefully nowhere near that cliff. With the amount of snowfall and debris... They could be buried deep. Exactly. I'll need you to fly as low as you can. I'll be your eyes and ears out there. Let's go! Do you want me to start hanging these? Yes, please. And this is our Christmas Countdown Cookie Counter! Christmas can officially begin. Is that like an advent calendar? Sort of. But you roll the days back until Christmas and have a cookie for each day. Because? Cookies! Well, I think that's a really cute tradition. This is such a beautiful tree. Smells so fresh, like you just took it out of the forest! Ah! Never from the forest. From Dana at the tree farm. You know what could be good? If you talked with Aunt Janine about working the Thompson Tree Detail. Yeah, sure! I would love to. But what is the Thompson Tree Detail? It's an old forest ranger tradition. She heads it up. I think you'd like it. Yeah, I'd love to. Steady Ted? Come in Steady Teddy. Nobody calls me that anymore, Buck. Well they should. You earned it. Thanks for guiding us through the peaks, buddy. Hey man, it's awesome to have you back on the team. We should catch up later. No, I better get back. Not tonight, you're not. You've just completed a high-stress search and rescue. You need to take a break. Okay okay. I guess I'm going to see you at the mess hall. Over and out. Copy that. Hey Buck. Would you consider staying longer? I can't, really. I'm in for a rough winter. They're forecasting record snowfall. And I'm seriously shorthanded. We need avalanche control and we need to start blasting it now. And quite frankly, there's no one east of the Rockies that has your skills. Please. Please please. Fine, I'll stay for a bit. Good. ♪ Hey, can you give me a minute? I'm just going to call home and let them know I'm staying. Okay. I'll get you some punch. Buck! Jess! Hey! Hey? Buck? Hey, can you hear me? Jess? Jess. The reception's bad. If you can hear me, the rescue went well. The skiers are safe. But I'm not going to be flying home tonight. You're flying home tonight? That's great! No! I'm staying. For a few days actually. A few days? Meg needs help with the avalanche control. All this early snow is wreaking havoc. Oh. Okay. Well, ah... You know what, we can, we can decorate our Christmas tree on the weekend. I'm not really sure how long the blasting is going to take. Blasting? Isn't that kind of dangerous? Buck! Come on! Friends are waiting! Look, I don't want to keep you from your work Sorry, what? Look Jess. We're going to decorate the tree next week, or the week after. I miss you. Me too. I know. Duty calls. Look, I'm really sorry about this. I didn't... Jess? Hello? Buck? There he is. The man of the hour trying to hide. Get in here. Introducing your local hero. Buck Thompson! You all did great today. To you! Cheers! - Hey! - Hey. Is Buck okay? Did he find those skiers? Yeah. Everyone is safe. Here let me. Thank you. That's great. Well, he will be starving when he gets back, so Aunt Janine has his plate over there. Oh, he's, um... He's actually not going to be home for a couple of days. Meg needed him at Avalon. It must be serious then. Yeah. I'm sure. Buddy, you just saved two lives, man. Don't look so down. Is everything okay at home? My girlfriend's disappointed I'm staying on. It's our first Thanksgiving. What, you're not home to hang some decorations together? Rescue Services, man, it's unpredictable. It's hard to find people that understand the stress and demands. Come on. Let's play! Don't worry. I'm going to let you win this time. Because I feel bad for you. That's what he says every time.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas. Only twenty-five days left to go! Soon. Okay now! Right. A huge amount of early snow plus warm weather gives us a weak layer in the snow blanket. Yeah. Weak snow pack on the steep eastern slopes, it's a double whammy. We use digital detonators now though, so it's more controlled. And a lot safer. Uh huh. Let's plan out the charges. All right. So I'm thinking we start here, then we go... Yeah. And then we'll just wipe them... Exactly. Okay. So then Josh and I have to go to his stepmom's for a second Christmas dinner on the 25th. And then we have to go to my Dad's for brunch on the 26th. Hey. Are you even listening to my holiday crabbiness? Yeah. It sounds like a lot of food. Maybe you just need to remind Buck what he's missing. Hey! Why don't you take a pic with this little gem? What did you do to her this time? I just replaced a pump. Still can't seem to get her to go, though. I haven't looked at her yet. Yeah, you give it a go. You know, Buck, I ah... I heard you been having some trouble. After you came home. Because of the dogs. It's tough to get Afghanistan out of my head. I'm still jolted awake some nights. Cold sweats. Yeah, man, me too. Me too. You know, I never told anyone what I see in my nightmares. Not even my own wife. She already has a pretty good idea. Listen, I started to talk with somebody. It helps. It's still there but, less. I'll shoot you the number? Yeah. Yeah, less would be good, man. So, what do you think? What did you do to her? Let's see you work your magic, Bucko. This is Buck Thompson. I'm up in snow country and I can't say when I'll get back to my phone. But leave a message. Okay! Here we go! Any info on the guy's injuries? Upper body. Maybe a broken collar bone. It's going to be difficult to transport.

Meg, I agreed to a few days. It's been a few weeks. And I am so grateful. But if you ever need a change of pace, maybe consider transferring up here for a season. That's an enticing offer, but... Ah, you can't blame me for asking. Look, we make a good team. We're good together. Yeah, we are. But I've got to get home. I've got to make sure I've got time to fuel up and beat this storm. You're not fueled up? The storm last night blocked all access to the road on the north side. Cars and fuel aren't getting in or out. I'm sorry Buck. Looks like you're going to be grounded here a few more days. Hey Meg. Are you coming? Yeah. Hey you! Hey... I was just going to call you and tell you that I... Jess... There was a storm last night. The northern road to Avalon is blocked. Oh. Well, if it's that bad, it sounds like your plane is grounded too. The problem is the fuel trucks. They can't get through so I can't start back until they clear out. Okay. No worries. I'll just... See you when I see you. Okay. Did you hear me when I said I can't make it? I did. I heard you. I just... I'm not surprised. I know the weather's bad, and your work... It's just the realities of our life together. And I am making peace with that. New Year's, then? So you're completely snowed in? Not completely. The northern road is blocked, the other roads are bad, but they're plowing them now. If I had my truck, I'd be there in a heartbeat. Well, you may not have a vehicle, but I do. Oh yeah? I'm coming to you. Jess! Jess, that's nuts. The weather's horrible, the roads are bad. There's black ice. Accidents happen fast and this temperature, it's brutal. I can handle winter. Snow shovel, bag of sand, warming candle, blankets. I got it covered! How about I grab a snowmobile? I could meet you half way. What do you say? Howler's Bay? Howler's Bay! That's right by your uncle's cabin! That's the one. I'll send you the coordinates. Okay, this is perfect. Although we don't really have a very good history with cabins, do we? Yeah. It's a good thing bears are hibernating this time of year. Although the weather can be just as dangerous as the bears. Well, I'll get a good night's sleep and leave first thing in the morning. Kiss you soon. And Jess... Be careful. I will. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ O come, all ye faithful, ♪ ♪ Joyful and triumphant ♪ ♪ O come ye, O come ye... ♪ Meg, are you sure you want to come? Look, no one knows these backwoods like I do.

No problem! It'll be fine. No thank you. How do I get him to stop staring at me like that? Oh. That's just how he shows affection. He likes you. Oh. Cute. Um... Hi! Here's a nice pat for ya. Yeah, I'll be honest. I'm more of a cat person. Because we, you know, mutually respect each other's independence. But family helps one another out. So. You consider me a part of your family? Look, ah... I know loving someone who's devoted their entire life to the service isn't easy. I'm just not really sure he even wants a relationship. He struggles to commit to the tiniest things. Try not to blame him for that. It's the job. I know. See? You're more of a Thompson than you realize. This is for you. A compass? It was my Dad's. It's for good luck. On a long trip. Oh, I don't want to take something so personal. Please, I want you to have it. Just bring it, and Buck back to us for Christmas. I will. And I'll make sure we get back for Walter's candlelight service. Okay. You be a good boy for Roma. Okay. Okay? - Thank you. - Uh huh. You kind of smell. We're going to take a shortcut. But we want to go south! Just trust me! Make sure you stay on my tracks. Hey! How's the Thompson Tree Detail this morning? Any suspicious behavior? Nothing suspicious. Only delicious. Jessica dropped these off this morning on her way to go meet Buck. Oh! She really went to meet him. Must be real feelings there. She also promised to have him back for Uncle Walt's candle light service. Cookie? To have the metabolism of a twenty-seven year old again. We've got to stay alert for last-minute shoppers today. Definitely. It's still pretty early, though, if you want your morning coffee. I'm good to start watch, thanks. Aunt Janine. Is there a reason you didn't you let Jess help with the Detail? And I quote "we have it covered this year". It's a Thompson family tradition, that's all. She makes Buck happy. I know you see that. Roma and I see that. She might be part of your family one day. When Walt left, he entrusted the Detail to me. He felt it was important that people respect the trees in our state forest. Now I'm in charge of protecting those trees. Okay. And by not inviting her to the family tradition you're just trying to protect the forest, right? Not Buck? Hey! Too many rocks. It's too dangerous. Let's head back to the trail. Come on, we've driven through much worse before. Let's keep going. We're almost at the pass and then we're not much farther from there. I've seen too much. Let's go! Come on. Okay. Okay! Enough with the staring. You like me. I get that. That's great, but enough. At ease, boy! Eyes front! Fine. Don't listen to my commands. I don't care. Hey! I was using that. No respect for rank! Are you okay? Okay. Let's get you up. I should have seen that log! It's okay. It's not your fault. But that log came out of nowhere. Well. At least we're close to the cabin. What about your shoulder? You're not wincing for nothing. You don't miss a thing. Nope. Do me a favor? Let me tell Ted about his machine. Ah. But it would be so much more fun if I could tell him. Meg! This old thing. He won't care. His wife's getting him a new one for Christmas. Buck! Buck, it's okay. You're safe. Come back to me. Okay. I think it's time to go home. Okay. We'll get you there. Let's just take a little break first, okay? I'll make us a fire. We can have some coffee. And then we'll keep going. Sounds good. What about that storm? It's not supposed to hit until later tonight. Long after we're both back home. Come on. No! Argh! Oh! Good morning. Good morning. My vehicle got stuck in all this snow. Do you think you could help me out? My truck won't be ready for a couple of hours. I'm getting it ready for the Christmas parade in town. Sorry, I don't have another vehicle to offer you. You have some beautiful dogs. Yup. The best. Fast as anything. Yeah, I can see that. Every winter, I spend a few weeks with my aunt and uncle up in Alaska. They have about fifty dogs. They train them. - Fifty? - Yeah. It's the best way to travel. Yup. It sure is. Your best trail is over here. You just have to watch for a few turns. I am here. You want to head all the way down here to where the path opens. Now to cross the pass and there's the cabin. Just over the river. So it's not too far? Not too far at all. Good for the pups. They need a good run. Thank you for trusting me with them. I'll have them back before the storm sets in. You're welcome. Hike! I just don't know if Jessica has the grit she'll need to be in a relationship with Buck. You saw how upset she was when he had to leave at Thanksgiving? Seems more like love to me. I don't understand not being with your family over the holidays. I mean, does she come from a solid family? Yes. They just celebrate differently, is all. Buck says she speaks to her Mom, Dad and brother almost every day. They're artists. They travel around a lot. Just a little less traditional than us, is all. Well it's fine that not every family is the same, as long as she's a good fit with ours. Aunt Janine, I know this time of year is hard for you and you're missing Uncle Walt. But remember how he'd always make room at the table for others? If he hadn't done that for me, I wouldn't be here. - Oh! Wait a minute. I've got one! Wait a minute. Two! Greedy grinches! Amara! I'm on it. Whoa! Okay guys. Good job, guys. Good job. Stop right there! Back away from the tree! Do you have a permit to cut this tree down? What's a permit? Come with me. Who sent you? No one. Stealing trees from the Wayne National Forest to sell at Christmas is not allowed. Are we in trouble? Oh, I'd say so. Please, ma'am, you can't tell our Mom. I can. And I will. They're just kids. Then I think you're the perfect age to learn about the consequences of your actions. Don't you think? Ah, good job guys. Good job. I got to figure out where I am. Okay... We're here. We're close. We have to be close. Okay, guys. Don't even think about going anywhere this time. How often are you still having PTSD episodes? Not as much anymore. Not since I met Jess. I'm seeing someone about it. Sleeping better too. What about Roma? What about her? How has she transitioned back to civilian life? Did she ever remarry? Re-what? Oh. Sorry. I... Meg. Spit it out. I don't think it was official. It was just a private ceremony at the base. I thought you knew. Roma is definitely not married. Well no. He went missing on his tour. He never made it back home. She never said anything. We've all been trained to set our emotions aside. That doesn't make it any easier. I know what it's like to love somebody and to not have them in your life. Meg, I... Would you reconsider moving back to Avalon Pass? I think there's more for you in the mountains than you think. Meg, I... Merry Christmas Buck! I hope I'm not interrupting anything? Jess! What are you doing here? Why aren't you in your car? Well, my car conked out. So I left it with a mechanic. Really nice guy. His name is Bob. I borrowed his dog sled so I could go on a romantic Christmas getaway with my boyfriend. Hey, I'm Meg. What brings you to these snowy parts, Meg? I was... I was just trying to show Buck a shortcut through the backwoods. And then... It's actually quite a funny story. We were racing through the forest and we had a bit of an accident. And then... It was pretty thrilling, though, wasn't it. Anyway, then we had to double on my snowmobile to get... Jess! Jess! What? Jess. Jess, where are you going? Home. I thought your car needed repairs. Yeah, it does! From the Santa parade than watch you have lunch all cozy with Meg. Nothing is going on! I was coming to see you. Meg was just helping me get there faster. And then I hit this log... Jess, please. We haven't seen each other in weeks! And I missed you. I didn't want things to start off this way. Me neither. We're off to a bumpy start, but, the cabin, it's going to be nice. Okay? You know, all I wanted was just to spend a few hours with you. No work, no rocks, no agenda. No other people. You know? I do. So when we get to the cabin, Meg is going to leave and it's just going to be just you and me. Meg is coming to the cabin? Your head is full of jingle bells if you think that's happening. Buck! Meg? Here! Bring your pack! What's going on? I was taking him down to get a drink by the river. And the poor guy stepped right into that fox trap. Meg, antiseptic, gauze, water. They're in the bag. Jessica, hold him by the shoulders. Steady. So he can't bite himself or us. I've got him. It's okay. I got him. - I'll be right by. - Okay. I shouldn't have taken him that way. I shouldn't have taken him to the river. I could've made a few trips and just brought him water. I could of brought all four of them water. I'm so sorry. It's not on you. It's not your fault. The trap is old. It looks like it's been there for a long time. His wounds aren't that deep. It's going to be okay. Meg. Listen. I need you to know how important Jess is to me. I care about her a lot. More than I've cared about anyone before. More than you care about me? We make a great team. We wouldn't have been friends this long if we weren't honest with each other. - Yeah? - Yeah. I can see how you feel about Jessica. I saw the way that you looked at her. You should tell her. She knows how I feel. She drove through a blizzard and rode a dog sled to get to you. You should tell her. Okay. Okay, seriously, this is a lot. I already have a best friend.

Yeah. Look, I'm really sorry about all that. She is really just a good friend. I can't help how 'handsome and brave' I am to other people. Oh, please. We'd better get going. I don't like the look of the sky. Looks like the storm's moving in faster than we thought. The cabin is just on the other side of the pass. We'll be fine. Right. In just a couple of hours and we'll be curled up by a fireplace. Visibility is getting worse. Temperature is dropping. And we're losing daylight. Three worst-case scenarios, all actually happening... Right now. Did you hear that? Are those what I think they are? Wolf tracks. Great. Welcome to Howler's Bay. Like this? That's it! And it you want, you can eat some. That's the fun part! When you're finished you can take it home for your tree. We don't have a tree this year. Mom said we can't afford it. That's right. We wanted to surprise her with one for Christmas to make her happy. She's been sad? That's thoughtful of you. Hey, can you make me one? I'll be right back. Aunt Janine, they weren't taking the tree to sell it. Sounds like they're having a hard time at home. Well that's still no reason to resort to petty crime. Behavior like this would never have been tolerated when I was a Junior Ranger. I know. We have to protect the forest. Oh I think their Mom's here. Sorry, I got here as soon as I could. Not to worry. They were stealing a tree? Really? I'm sorry. My kids are good kids. I just haven't been able to keep them in line and do everything without James being here. James is your husband? Yeah. He's a petroleum engineer. He's away on an oil rig for six months. I worry about him. It's hard to celebrate when he's gone. If you were to come to the bakery, I'd be more than happy to make this up to you with some fresh cinnamon rolls for Christmas? Mom! Hi sweetheart! I'm sorry, Mom. Are we in trouble? We just wanted you to have a tree. Can we go home now? Rachel, Marcus... I'm afraid you can't leave just yet. I expect you to make this right. Are we out of gas? That's impossible. The gauge says full. I guess the gauge is broken. Great. Well... How far is the cabin from here? Just across the river. Are you up for a hike? Yeah. Let's do it. There you go. Go ahead. So these decorations need to find a new home. On your tree. The one you didn't cut down. Thanks, Ms Thompson. Can we go decorate it now? Off you go. Follow me. Thank you! You're welcome. Thank you for making them happy. You know, the Rangers and I could always use help in the forest. Maybe your kids would like to join the Junior Rangers? They would love that. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Go on! Is that my Father's compass? Yeah. Roma gave it to me. For our trip. She did? She must like you. Yeah, I like her too. She's actually watching Charlie for me. Roma is dog sitting? Wow. She must really like you. Well, she kind of seemed happy to have some company. Although, she's more of a cat person. Roma to Charlie... Roma to Charlie, requesting permission to land. There you go. Of course I brought a treat for you. I am your Santa. Just don't tell Jessica I'm giving you treats, okay? Otherwise she won't let me dog sit you anymore. Where is she? We should be getting ready by now. Pretty quiet up there. You're way too quiet for Jessica. No I'm not. Yes you are. You talk endlessly when you're excited. You laugh when you're nervous. But you laugh when you try not to laugh at your own joke and you are quiet when you're over thinking. You know you don't know everything about me, Buck Thompson. We've only been dating a few months. But I like everything I've learned about you. Especially your rock puns. Well. I've missed you. I realized all I wanted to do was just be with you. And you were up there with Meg, rescuing people and saving people's lives, and making the world a better place and... That's just it, Jess. You make the world so much better than I ever could. Just by being you. Get back. Yeah. I know... Scary foxes. Can we please just shake this whole Meg thing off? I can't control how she feels. All I can control is how I feel. And I really want to spend Christmas with my girlfriend. Better? Much. Thank you. I know how I feel about you, too. And the jumping helped. A little. I can kind of feel my toes again. Sort of. We can cross through here. The river's just over that hill. Well, I read the map too and... It's not going to take much longer if we stick to the safer route. Okay. You lead the way. ♪ ♪ ♪ You think Dad would like this? How could he not? Look how beautiful it is! Yeah. He'd think it was perfect. Well, you can come back next year and decorate it again. Plus everyone who comes to the woods can see it. It's beautiful! Thank you, Amara. Hello! Hi Charlie! Merry Christmas Eve! Hello to you too. Hi. So how're your first dog adventures going? Oh, I'd say we had a really good time. Didn't we? Yes we did. Oh! Didn't think you were much of a dog person. I'd say I'm more of a Charlie person. You guys ready to go? Yeah, I just need to grab my coat. And, of course, his squeaky toy. Come on! Hey Aunt Janine. Roma and I are getting ready to go. Hey. Listen. Have you heard from Buck? I'd like my son here for church on Christmas Eve. Jessica promised she'd call when she gets to the cabin. They're just catching up. Right. Well, okay. She knows to drive him back in time for our family celebrations. So if that doesn't earn the girl some serious points in your books, I don't know what will. Okay. So where on earth are they? I don't know. But Buck wouldn't deviate from the plan. They must be close. Right. Well, I suppose if anyone could make it through the wilds, it's those two. You know, singing might help warm us up. No chance. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's that sound. The howling. I know. It's haunting. We're getting close. I can hear the river. It's going to be dangerous, but it's the only way to get home. Hey. I know. We need to get home. Thank you. A guy could really freeze up out here. Don't even joke about frostbite. Come on. The river sounds like it's running fast. It sounds dangerous. The river looks higher this year. Well... Looks like we're spending Christmas in the wilds. We either cross the river or we sleep outside. We have no idea how deep that is. What will kill us first? The freezing cold river or the current? Let's find a better place to cross. The water's shallower here. Even in the middle. It should only go up to about mid-thigh. It's narrower here so it will be quicker to get across. It's easy. We're not going to find a better way to cross. The current only gets stronger the further down we go. I, I know. I'm not going to let anything happen to you. Just think about that cabin on the other side of that ridge. A big warm fire that's waiting for us. You're making future plans now? Jess, I need you to trust me. We can do this. You and I. Together. Okay. Okay. Wait wait! I don't think I can do this! Jess, you keep going. Quick, but steady. Buck! Buck! Buck! Buck! Come on! Come on! We need to get your boots and wet clothes off now! Okay, I'm going to make a fire. And call your Mom and Amara. So, how do I look? Very handsome and brave. Festive. Thank you. Here. Let me take those. Sit down. Is the radio working this time? Yeah. I radioed in our position to Amara. Your Mom was relieved to hear we were okay. Another hour, she would've sent out the search party. But, she did manage to save us some of her homemade egg nog. She's starting to like you. Well, I am the beautiful, courageous woman who made it through the forest and across that river with her son. Jess, Jess. Please. I'm more likely to die of blanket suffocation than hypothermia at this point. I promise, I'm good. Just one more. There. You're looking better. Blue lips weren't a great look for you. I'm going to remember that for next time. You know Buck, thank you for getting us across that river. But I'd appreciate it if you'd stop doing such dangerous things. I'm tired of having to save you! - Oh really. - Yeah! Well, I think we saved each other this time. Come here. Well, it looks like we get to spend Christmas Eve together after all. I'm grateful. Me too. Hey Jess... Ever since I got back from Afghanistan, I've been keeping the ones I love at a distance. Even you. And I know that these last few weeks have been difficult, being separated, but if we weren't away from each other, I wouldn't have realized how much I want that to change. Forever. I want you to have something. My lucky rock. It's just a stand in. For now. Until I can get you a much more sparkly one. Jessica Alaway. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Will you marry me? Yes! Yes! I love you, Jess. I love you more. Ah, that's not possible. You do realize we have to get home for Christmas Eve dinner now. Or Mom's going to kill us both. Yeah, I know. I can't believe I have to do this again! Admit it. You like it. Wow! That is quite the outfit! Very festive. Yeah. It's keeping me warm. I can see that. Well, we have a Christmas Eve to get to. We cannot be late for service. You're welcome for the rescue. Rescue? That's not what this was! You just came in to give me fashion advice. Come on. Thank you so much for bringing him home in one piece. I'm so glad to be here. Me too. Congratulations! Thank you. I'm proud of you. A rock, though? Yeah, it's a long story. Maybe I'll tell you another time. Okay. I know I didn't get you for secret Santa this year, but I did get you a gift. What are you talking about? I made some calls. And we're going to find him. Your missing soldier. Thank you. You know, it helps to talk to somebody. Take it from somebody who knows how hard it is to come home. Yeah. Yeah. Hello! A toast! Yes! Come gather around, kids. Nothing formal. Nothing fancy. I would just like to make a toast to love... And to family. To Uncle Walt! Cheers everybody. Cheers. Oops! Buck! Every year! It's time to go! - Oh goodness. - It is! You need a jacket. I lost my in the river, Mom. I'm just glad I didn't lose you in that river. Stand by. Okay. Dad's coat? Yeah. You need it now, honey. This will keep you warm. Oh my gosh! Look at this. It fits you perfectly. You look nice. Thank you. - Are you ready? - Uh huh. All right kids. Jessica, after you. Okay. Let's go. Nice jacket. ♪ ♪ This is so beautiful. ♪ Dad always taught us, especially at Christmas, you should share the joy. Well, that's easy for you guys. You all have beautiful voices. Um, I've heard your voice. It's beautiful too. ♪ It's so beautiful. It makes me think of Dad. Me too, sweetheart. We light these candles to keep him safe. ♪ ♪ Silent night ♪ Holy night ♪ All is calm All is bright ♪ ♪ Round yon virgin Mother and Child ♪ ♪ Holy infant so tender and mild ♪ ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace Merry Christmas! Thank you. Thank you. These are adorable. She does them every year. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. You know, this has been a pretty great Christmas Eve. You're the best present I could have ever asked for. You're mine too. You know, I don't think we could have planned a better holiday if we tried. Other than the blizzard, extreme cold, and icy river. The cabin was nice. Yeah! There's no meteor shower tonight. That's okay. I think I've had enough of the wonders of nature for now. I am perfectly content with a boring life with my fiancé. I think our life together is going to be anything but boring. I think so too.
