As we ... Sunset on the lake. One of the last few days of ice on Björkvattnet-Jön. You can hear the geese. Beautiful sky. You can hear the water and the ice cracking. And in just one week this will be transformed as the snow is gone, and spring arrives. Welcome to the wonderful forests around me. They are full of biodiversity. Red List biodiversity. Peace and tranquility, beautiful trees. But it’s all under attack. So, you know, this is .. This is today. And ... welcome to the future. You probably see behind me ... absolute devastation. They’re really shocked at how big this wind farm has become. I mean it is ... just .. jaw ... Jaw dropping !! And this is just a little section. There are 33 of these. Spread across ... the area. The biggest turbines in the world. The GE Cypress. Built ... as we are claiming. illegally ... Exploiting the environmental permits, lying ... That cannot deliver .. any climate change benefit. It’s crazy. Gotta look for beauty. We have to be creative. We have to be creators, and contributors. And not destroyers and ... consumers. That’s not the way it should work. This is not a future, that I think we should be proud of. This isn’t progress. This is the opposite of progress. This is what happens, when parasites destroy their host. You know, 8 billion people is not too many people. Too many people doing the wrong things. If we had 8 billion people creating and contributing ... the planet would be fixed in a second. As a filmmaker, I’m receiving stories on a daily base. From gardeners, farmers or individuals, who were all working with and in nature. Finding innovative ways in order to create the balance we need, to simply survive and protect. They’re all sending me their view, how we can contribute to our planet and at the same time leading a rich and fulfilled life. And it’s the complexity of the day, right ? Because to be honest, we're all fed by the monster of world uncertainty, driven by politics and institutions of fear. Where the Hollistic puzzle of life has become a psychedelic artwork, which no one understands anymore ... Unless you’re on drugs ... which, in some extent, I believe we are. But this story somehow was different. So I asked him for more details. Everyone seems to start with their credentials on these types of videos. Alexander Pohl. I’m in my almost mid 40s. I've studied civil and environmental engineering, been fascinated by engineering and the environment. So that was all about building infrastructure to fix the planet’s problems ... I spent four months in Grenada doing my thesis on ... waste management and rubbish on little islands in the Caribbean. Or had a year off so I could travel ... I’ve, I've, I met, I met a girl, had, had a romance, uh ended up getting married, and then I came back to London. And that sort of starts my story .. in London. And I spent five years with KPMG doing .. all types of things. I did a lot of sustainability, in the early days of something called the "Clean Development Mechanism." This was the early days of climate change. So this is 20 years ago. Climate change is a thing people are starting to care about it. And, uh, the United Nations set up a program with hundreds, if not billions of dollars, to incentivize companies to reduce emissions, um, and we help them. We did the auditing. We did the validation. And ... it turns out it was all corrupt. I worked with the biggest companies: BP, Shell, Enios, ah.. you know these uh .. Hitachi, when we helped them greenwash some of them. What do you mean by greenwashing ? I do a little bit of good, that I talk a lot about, and then that hides ... You know, it’s like an iceberg. I have a green tipped iceberg, with everything under the water being black. We helped a lot around auditing, because you know, a lot of people rely on numbers to make decisions. You know this is a zero and one’s world. And if you have a company like KPMG saying the numbers are good ... well, even if the numbers aren’t good ... People still believe that they’re good. And an auditing firm puts so many caveats. Why do companies go bankrupt when they’ve been audited ? Well, it’s because there are so many caveats that say, well, based on the information we saw, it looks OK. And it’s always: it looks OK. It’s not .. it is OK. And that then allows, this underworld, and undercurrents of ... I will pay you some money to say this looks OK. You will not be held account, but you can do that across financial numbers, climate change numbers, amounts of pollution. I talk a lot about the little bit of good I do, so that everyone is distracted ... from all of the bad. It was all about money. So I said, OK, well, who controls the money in the world ? Well, it’s the banks. So I said, OK, well I need to go to a bank. And so I found a bank, a job. I’m looking at risk, and it was at HSBC ... Which prides itself on being one of the most sustainable banks in the world ... That green finance provides ... a once in a generation opportunity, or a once in a multi-generation opportunity to at the same time, be bankers and doing the right thing. So I did hundreds of millions of lending to big projects, power stations fueled by trees, big wind farms, big solar farms, and I thought we're good. But, but the whole time things started feeling funny. It was like a glitch. I was like, well, this doesn’t feel right. These people are doing these big projects making lots of money, but they are not sustainable. You know, these are some of the most ego-driven .. uh monsters. There’s a lot of dark stuff in these companies' supply chains. It’s all about money, and they were using the sustainability agenda, just as another tool, another stick to beat their suppliers with. So there was nothing about ... nobly saving the world. It was about more profits. And at that point I was like: This is a broken system. Yeah. Then I got fed up. Then I said enough is enough. I need to do something different. This is killing me, and I decided I was going to leave. I looked at places like New Zealand. Beautiful place, good for sustainability, but it’s already been bought up by Chinese and Silicon Valley billionaires. Then I looked at Chile and Patagonia. Politically instable. Then I looked at Canada. Too close to US, and the industrialization of nature is pretty advanced there. Then, then there’s Russia. Didn’t really work. And I was left with Sweden. Sweden has the word Eden in it. You know, I was looking for my own Eden, where I could do ecovillage or permaculture, agroforestry, grow your own food, live um.. sustainably, Uh ... and this fit the bill. It feels so good, to be safe in nature, and to be in a place where I feel that I could breathe fresh air. Ahhh .. I mean, it’s just so good ! I wanna get away. I wanna be free. And here is the waterfall ... Wow ... Here we go, absolutely incredible. Double, complete rainbow ... Baby reindeer. Isn’t that incredible ? One of the greatest things about being out here in .. in Sweden is the fact that I’m in the country and uh ... and it’s beautiful, and it’s natural, and fresh air. Thinking about our our individual purpose, my purpose for the moment is to get cold. Ahh ... So ... today’s ... conversation in the cold. With Alexander ... Yeah. So what’s going to come next ? First thing I gonna do is uh ... I’m gonna spend a lot more time with people. I need to balance my "me time" with the "we time." And making sure that that "we time" is constructive time. So ... helping .... make other people’s lives better, helps make my own life better. Help create, to build, to share. So my wife will probably give me a hard time, but I wanna ... gonna have people over for dinner. Want to go over to people's houses for dinner. Well, play dates for the kids. I want the kids to play in groups. And to run around, and run a bit of riot. I want to give more than I take. And that’s a really tough one, because you do need to balance. Taking care of yourself. Uh, in the context of taking care of others. But if we all give two and take one ... You know that’s going to be net regenerative. It was only through random conversation with someone locally, who had said there had been a meeting about a wind farm. And we said "Wind Farm ?" We didn’t see any wind farms. You know there were none to be seen. And so then I started to dig. And it turned out that this was a wind farm in development. They had already been building for 3 months. It was the biggest wind farm in the world. It was all really confusing to me. I’m in a natural place, with "Natur2000" protected. Everyone talks about nature, and how important nature is for health and well being. And then there’s this ... basically industrial power station, over hundreds of kilometers, square kilometers of forest. It just didn’t make sense. And then I started digging. I ... I removed the facades, and I could see behind the curtain. And then I started seeing the money. You know this money thing, that I had tried to run away from. These people are everywhere. You know, this is a systemic corruption. And, and that’s why I’m, I, I persisted with you. And when people listen to our conversation and see the broader story, they can start recognizing those patterns in their own lives. Hi Alex, this is Marijn ... I'm I think we should do the story together. You know ? Well, justice is an easy word to pronounce, but you know it can be a hazard to receive, when you're alone, right ? So, um ... yeah, I’ll be on my way. Hey Marijn, thanks for the message. This is um ... ah, it's a big risk in in, certain respects, but you know a risk worth taking. It says, you know the ... Yeah this, this movement that’s rising the big, you know, positive system that’s trying to reclaim this world for the better. And, and it is, you know, I just had lots of bad experiences with these .. um, you know, people in the old system. And they’re not ready to be woken up, and they all become, you know, violent, and uh .. negative and destructive, but I really just want these people all to, uh .. you know, to have their "Aha" moment. and to rise up in a positive way. OK. Anyway, let’s speak on Friday ... So that we are in nature. What does nature mean to you? Nature for me is ... the foundation of everything. Uh .. I am nature. Everything is nature. So it’s this, it’s this ... the ... what was already there .. that we didn’t create .. that makes it special. And uh .. this place for me is much, much closer to nature, than where I came from, when I was in London. And now you know, I hear so much about climate change and nature, but .. I don’t just necessarily disagree with, with that. It’s just the order. It should be nature first, and then, you know, we deal with what’s left. If there’s still a climate problem afterwards. I just don’t understand why we’re so focused on climate. And ... their solutions are destroying nature. You know, we almost treat the climate like a living thing. But it’s, it’s not alive. It uh ... what do you mean ? Well, if you think about it, and, if you, if you take care of nature, uh .. nature gives back, you know .. You grow a tree, it will provide you food and shelter. You know, it provides our basic human needs. The weather doesn’t do that. You know climate doesn’t do that. It’s a .. it’s a facilitator. Maybe, you know, it’s one of the inputs. But ultimately .. it’s nature that you need to take care of, because that’s what takes care of us. How do you see the solution ? Look uh ... this what I have here, was what I thought was better. I thought, you go to a place where you live with less. You’re closer to nature. You do a bit more work, but that work is for yourself. You know you’re no longer working for .. the corporation or uh .. and you do it in a, in a nature sympathetic way. You know, you're living in nature, you’re living with nature. Everything you do, you do with consideration for nature, and you do it in a community with other people. So, you know, coming from a city where I lived for 20 years, and I knew no one. You know, I knew of my colleagues at work, but I didn’t know any of my neighbors. Certainly, I couldn’t rely on any of them, and then suddenly to come here, where, you know, if you don’t ... if you don’t work together, you could die, uh .. freeze in the winter, or something. Yeah, that’s what I think the solution is, is that it’s, it's actually going back to nature. I’m no different than a typical person living in a big city. But now I am, you know, I’m .. I’m myself again. In the city, I wasn’t me. I was, I was a product of the .. the system. I was a slave to my job, uh .. to materialism, to ego. And out here, you know, I look a lot of the time, I look .. very natural, and you know, to be able to just spend some time .. not having to .. just stress about things ... that don’t matter, you know, nature matters. But windmills aren’t bad, right ? Well ? I’m not against the wind. We’ve always used the wind, you know, thousands of years for sailing and mechanical movement. I just have against, something against using it really badly, and in a way that actually makes the problem worse, than actually fixes it. Uh .. a wind turbine is made of plastic. Uh .. you need to use a big area of nature. To ... make electricity. So the wind turbines are just another .. inefficient tool to exacerbate our electricity problem. Once a wind turbine's been put in ecosystems, that ecosystem is broken. You know it will never be its full potential. But somehow oil plants are doing the same, isn’t it ? You are right. An oil plant done badly is doing the same. But, if you think about it, an oil plant takes a smaller amount of space. It can be put somewhere for a long period of time, and if we spent the money to do it properly, you know, a lot of our industrial infrastructure, would not damage nature the way that, you know it does now. So, rather than putting up windfarms, I would argue we should be improving the quality and technology of our existing infrastructures. This place is untouched in a way. But they’re filling it full of turbines. No people, no animals. The only things that can really survive in a wind farm and thrive, are machines. So I’m asking myself, are we solving for machines or for humans in nature ? So basically they’re giving it a death sentence. It’s a old family property, a couple of 100 years back .. ah .. to the farm. There is about 10 hectares of uh .. fields around here. I’m, I’m uh, managing the forest. Last autumn I did uh .. I got a very big surprise walking there on the property with the beautiful mosses and the old forests that we kept. And out of the fog ... I started to see some new creatures. It was like steel buildings. And then I saw it was huge windmills. Before 2019, they were not there. But you didn’t know anything about the wind industry before ? Triggered by this, I started to study the, the issue. But do you think one day wind energy can become a solution ? My answer is no, definitely no. I don’t see a future with windmills. Um ... as traveling around the world, and working in the forest sector, I have enjoyed, where they put windmills farms in, in cooperatives in rural areas in Africa and South East Asia and so on. But when they started to build these huge parks, into the national grid, I don’t understand. Um, and uh..the uh .. the problem I see is a .. a global problem, because studying this from, from scratch, the, the, the mining and the, the refining and the production, and the fabrication of the windmills. And all these metal materials that is needed, uh .. consumes a huge amount of energy which is 100% fossil ... These rare metals, are to a big extent Chinese. They have, they are dominating the market. And now, people around the world are looking for new .. uh .. mining to to uh .. assure or safeguard their um .. their supply of these metals. So we are going from a fossil society .. to a metal society. And I don’t believe it’s the right thing. Swedish people are a nature friendly people. They're destroying the nature, for both humans and animals. And, and I have been there since I was a little kid. I know this place. I love that, that place and seeing, and now when I see, how they’re destroying it, it’s make me sad. How do you think it’s destroying ? Yeah, they are placing these monster turbines in a quiet area. There is only forest. You don’t hear any other sounds as the wind and the birds and, some, maybe some trucks, some cars, but it’s a very quiet place. It’s no city environment, and they, I think the government now knows that there are these ... people are raised against it. I think it’s a big problem for the government. Now, they want to force ... for a ... remove the communal veto. Every commune has the right, has their right to say no to wind farms, but now the government wants to remove it. But many people are scared, especially here in Jämtland, I think .. Where from ? .. I think people are scared from .. from authorities ... from the government, from, from the big companies. I think people are told to shut up. I’m really, really excited in a way, because our court case has been brought forward. Hopefully, that’ll take place around the 30th of November. We could stop the wind farm. That the people, who were doing it, that we’ve identified, that the fraud is happening all over the place, and they’re all being caught with their trousers down. You know they’ve become so brash, that you know, and so audacious that, uh .. you know they, they started to make mistakes. You are one of Alexander’s lawyers. Ah .. it’s quite a brave action to challenge windfarms as a private person. I mean you’re fighting against big corporations involving millions of dollars. Why do you believe in this case? Alexander has identified uh .. errors in the environmental legal system, and by trying to solve this with legal tools. Then, we have discovered further errors. And these errors that, is hard to catch legally. And that is basically, because the environmental code in Sweden, and the environmental legal process, is based on the trust of the developers. And besides that, the legal force of a permit at .. is strong, and the public interest is in the hands of the authorities. And this is one of the big problems that we are meeting and struggling with. I just got an email from my lawyers talking about challenges in accessing justice in the Swedish legal system. We’ve been highlighting the fact that they’ve been committing fraud and doing illegal activities, but the courts have not been giving us access, and actually it’s reached the point, now that they’re just dismissing our cases. Citing the fact that we as citizens don’t have the legal right to question permits issued by the government .. or even really to question the government at all. And so it’s super strange, if we don’t even have access to justice. How is the government accountable, if citizens can’t hold it to account ? May we have all the evidence, but if the evidence doesn’t even make it into the courts, this is as if our evidence didn’t exist. There are some big system shifts ahead of us. Uh .. and they’re they’re pushing the narrative towards green renewables. How do you see this green Wonderland they’re creating, out of a juristic point of view ? I'm painfully aware of the climate changes, and ah .. that we are standing in front of a crisis that claims actions. And I fully, fully support the idea of green electricity, of course. The problem is, that there, there is no such thing as green electricity. As long as as their production is done at the cost of the land, libelt and the culture of the indigenous people. Wow, they're massive ! Wind turbines are, are surprising machines. You know, I’m, I’m an engineer by degree, so ... I used to love these things, but you know it's ... each turbine takes about 30 truckloads to get here. Steel towers, plastic blades. The blades of the turbine actually are a little bit like an airplane wing. But they’re made with layers and layers of Bisphenol-A plastic, usually around a core of carbon fiber or balsa wood from the Amazon. And then on the outside they put some kind of an epoxy paint or something along those lines. I .. actually overtime they degrade. Just like a propeller on a boat or a propeller on a plane. So over the life of a turbine they're, they’re throwing out kilos and uh.. tons of microplastics. These turbines are 140 meters up to the the generator, and then each blade is approximately 80 meters long, weighing 20 tons. The generator on top is probably another 60 tons. There’s about 100 or 120 tons, uh .. so the equivalent of maybe 120 cars. uh ... on top of this ... steel tower, and then what lurks beneath is a massive raft of concrete. Thousands of tons of concrete. Down there ... massive holes. This is ... this is what they call progress. It’s always .. carbon dioxide, always carbon dioxide, no talk about poisoning the planet through heavy metals. No talking about poisoning the planet through uh.. plastics. You know, if you stop burning fossil fuels, but you keep making plastics, you still kill the planet ... Crazy ... Insanity ... Yeah, so you could just see the scale. These steel towers are being produced in China ... The reason ? It’s cheap. They’re manufactured in coal fired steel plants. As we’re being told, not so environmental friendly. Made in China and shipped in large cargo ships all the way to Sweden. Driven hundreds of km through the forest. And finally be constructed. to last 20 years .... Just to produce some electricity. And all the energy that went into it ... could be used for other things ... You know, this is the reality of ... wind farms' devastation. Clear felt ! This is wind farms. I just thought you’d like to see how they line them up. Line them up. Cut em down. Rows and rows ... Ready for the machines to come ... And collect them to be liquefied, shredded, whatever they get used for ... You can see they're gonna be blasting this out. Ooh ... That’s scary. Those are all explosive holes. And as you could see ... Yeah. This isn’t pretty. But if it’s hidden away and people don’t see it, people don’t have to deal with it. This used to be the top of a hill. They blasted it away with great violence. You know, one of the things about wind farms that I’m learning is, that it’s involved. There’s a lot of violence involved in, in wind power. Uh .. starting from how it’s made through to where the minerals come from, that they use in the supply chains, through to those who speak out, questioning, whether this makes sense ... It’s not a surprise. Wind mills heavily rely on critical minerals. Neodymium, Praseodymium and Dysprosium. And these rare earth elements rely on volatile and Chinese concentrated supply chains. It delivered 70% of the global demand in 2018. The good news ? The Chinese markets will go wild. The bad news ? It’s damaging a lot more than it will fix. The environmental impact of the extraction is estimated to be more damaging than fossil fuel extraction due to the toxic effluent emissions and waste, generated from the intensive mining activity. Tons of radioactive waste is generated as a result of the refinement of the minerals. It has impacted the access to fresh water, and food production in local communities surrounding the mines. In some regions, vegetation has stopped growing. Cattle that died from toxins in the soil, and drinking water has been contaminated. But there’s more. Windmills also needs cobalt. A lot. Again, a rare mineral. 70% of the world supply comes out of the cobalt mines of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. You know, that African country, which strangely enough, is in a bloody conflict for generations. To say the last words. We're creating a bit of a mess. And no ! We’re not saving the planet with it. Yeah, you’re in the city ... and your comfortable space, and you don’t know what’s going on in the middle of the forest. When I was sitting in my office in London, I used to finance wind farms and I, I believed in this. But I didn’t know, and, you know, as soon as I got more information, and I started looking behind the propaganda I, I just I couldn’t believe it. I had cognitive dissonance, and and I never thought I would be that kind of person, who would just ignore something. So then I went into it, and you know, I’ve come into these wind farms now. I’ve looked at the devastation. I’ve spoken to the people who built them. They even admit that this is ridiculous, but they’re getting paid, and they’ve got bills to pay, so they just go along with it. But at some point we’re all going to look back and say ... Why were we such idiots ? So yeah, this uh .. This should save the planet ? You know, if it’s .. if this saves the planet, sign me up. I’d grab a shovel, I’d be digging here. But now that I know, that this is actually going to destroy the planet, I’m raising the alarm. You know, every time I go out and talk to someone, I’m trying to make them .. convince me, that this makes sense. No one’s convinced me yet ... Let me give you an overview of uh .. what I like to call the front line. I live here, Björkvattnet. There were some windfarms when I first arrived to it, but I didn’t see them because they were hidden quite far away. Yeah, and then I discovered, that there were a total of .. 10, 9-10 wind farms around me. And then, the first one that I discovered by accident, which was Bjorklund net, is here. I have a court case against that in the Supreme Court. But then, there’s also Hocksjön. This one is owned by Jämtkraft and Persson Invest. I have a court case against them as well. But there are a number of other wind farms, and they all seem to be coming closer and closer to Björkvattnet. It’s like an army marching closer and closer and I had to ask myself why ? Why here, why so many wind farms? All these companies wanting to build wind farms here, where it’s not windy, but it’s remote. So I wondered: is this really about saving the climate or could it be a different motivator ? So this is Björkvattnet, 33 turbines. And it’s being built by a company called infra Via, a French private Equity House. They talk about this, as being their gift to the world, you know, it’s going to save the planet, gonna save climate. What’s a French company ... doing in the remote forests of Sweden ? However, you can’t build a wind farm on your own, and it turns out that this wind farm was originally developed by General Electric. Just that little company from America, that uh .. needed a place to launch their new prototype mega-turbine, and they found a remote place in the middle of a Swedish forest to do that. Of course, they couldn't build it launched, so they found a company called Stenger and Ibsen, which is a Danish company. They came here, not with a scalpel, you know, because this is del ... delicate forest and actually it’s a it’s peat forest and peat is so important, if you care about the climate. It’s also so important, if you care about the environment. But they came here with basically a sledgehammer and a chainsaw. It just hacked up this place. Of course, you can’t build a wind farm without someone to take the electricity. And in this case the poster child is Google ... They’re going to save the world with the wind farm. Why do they need it ? Oh well, Google is building a new data Center for the cloud in Finland a thousand kilometers away. So the electricity here, will probably go to Finland. Yes, most of it will go to Finland. And why is it going to Finland? Because it’s cheap ! Why doesn’t it stay in Sweden ? Sweden doesn’t need it ! Sweden met its 2030 renewable energy target in 2018. This place is, is full of hydroelectric from 1930 and 1940s. So they don’t need the electricity and actually most people don’t realize, that a lot of wind farms, and other renewable energy projects are to feed new infrastructure that was never there before. So it’s not even fixing, you know, the existing energy. It’s all new, but of course, infra Via can’t build it on its own. Infra Via doesn’t have any money, they’re just a manager, So they have to find people. They have a fund in Luxembourg because it’s good for tax, you know, tax avoidance, and they found investors who are happy to put their money into Luxembourg to get a tax efficient way of doing business. This wind farm will never make money. You know, these windfarms are designed to make losses, so they don’t pay taxes here. They take all that money to Luxembourg so you can get, you know, you can get the maximum profits. Who did they find ? They found Munich Re, one of the largest reinsurance companies in the world, that just talks about how great it is for the environment there, from Germany. Of course. Munich Re’s not alone. This is a super secret Luxembourg fund as most Luxembourg funds are. You know, you don’t want to know who’s tax avoiding because it doesn’t look so good ... But they got themselves the Oslo city pension fund from Norway, WNW a pension and insurance company in Germany, and finally a Dutch company: The physiotherapists pension fund invested in the remote forests of Sweden. I wrote to all of them and said: Hey, do you know what people are doing with your money ? You know, maybe they’re not telling you the truth. None of them really cared. So you know, of course you can’t build wind farms without banks. BNP Paribas, a top bank. More banks, Dutch banks: ABN, Amro. Another French bank: Soc Gen. (Société Générale) And finally I discovered that the fund in Luxembourg, has an SDG-linked equity facility. That means, they borrow the money. You know, even for the little bit, that they are supposed to put in themselves, I said yes, HSBC, the bank I worked for. I wrote to my old boss. And I said, hey, you guys are the top, you know, the pinnacle of sustainability and SDG-linked, so sustainable development goals ? Linked facility ? What if they're lying, and it’s not sustainable ? They basically said, hey, you know, we’re not really that bothered what they do on the level. We just take an average, and you know we just look at it from a, uh .. you know, an umbrella perspective. So again, you know, no one cares about the detail. It’s just about the profit, and you know, the, the image. And that really hurt. But of course I thought, hey, you know, there’s a United Nations of players here. The United Nations is actually involved. Infra Via has .. proudly wears the United Nations' "Principles for Responsible Investment" badge, which is supposed to be the gold standard, that this investor actually cares, and that he’s .. he's honorable, and trustworthy with regards to his sustainability standards. I wrote to them and said hey, infra Via is misusing your .. you know, badge of honor and the CEO, Fiona Reynolds, came back and said: look, we spoke to the company. They said everything is OK. They did their paperwork on time, and they paid their fee, so therefore we’re not going to .. do anything else. You know, I understand, there’s a lot of money at play here, but you know, all of this just seems to be smoke and mirrors. You know, sustainability is just distracting you. You know, you hear the words, you don’t actually look at the detail. And the only conclusion I could come to, based on all of these players, what they’re doing looking at the projects, looking at the actual impacts, the benefits. It’s just all about money. But this whole thing makes you mad, right ? It makes me so angry, I .. I don’t have the words to describe it. But, but angry .. to whom ? Ha ... I make it everyone, you know I'm, I’m angry at the company that’s building the wind farms. I’m angry at the companies that make the, the turbines. I’m angry at the politicians and the regulators who gave the permits. I’m angry at the NGOs, who tell us that, you know these turbines will save the world. And then I’m angry at, you know, Greta, Al Gore. All these celebrities who could do so much good. And they’re saying wind turbines are good. Well, that’s fine. Quite confusing and complex is that, you know, what I think is that the science is being hijacked in a, in a too early stage by NGOs who can use it for their own, you know, profits. The NGO’s are hijacking politics, and the politics and NGO's are being hijacked by corporates. So it’s .. it’s very confusing and complex, you know, to blame someone, right ? It is ... But what you just described me, was following the money. You know, money is driving this. But equally, I’m just trying to figure out ... Yes, money corrupts. But how can it corrupt so many people ? These people can’t all be bad. You know, I don’t understand what they’re thinking. There’s just, there’s so many passionate people, you know. I, I look at a WWF or Greenpeace or in here in Sweden they’re called Skydda Skogen or uh ... The Sweden National Conservation Society. Where is Greta ? These are passionate people. They’re just shouting ... about the wrong things ... You know, I’ve tried many other options. I’ve tried fighting. I’ve tried the courts, I’ve tried complaining. The only thing I haven’t tried yet, is actually going up to these people, and asking them openly and honestly questions about why they are doing what they’re doing. So we went to Stockholm. To ask questions ... Oh hey, thanks. Keep it up. Thank you very much. Today, SEA is ah .. Europe’s largest private forest owners, and the .. it is the forest 2.6 million hectares of forestland, and an area about the size of Belgium, uh .. that is the core of the company, and around this resource of, of well managed well growing forests, we have built an industry, uh .. and other activities designed to create as much value as possible in and from these forests. Our ambition is to manage these forests, so that they should be as rich in timber, in biodiversity and in experiences ... uh.. tomorrow as they are today. Uh ..at the same time, we see these forests as a key resource when it comes to combating climate change. You spoke about SEA and the value of the forests, the trees. I guess the, the fact that they grow on their own with careful stewardship .. How does that connect with wind power ? We have two value streams, uh .. connected with this land resource. First, and we manage and use the forests, and when the tree is harvested, uh .. we make sure that all of it is put to good use. The other value, value stream, is that our land resource also, is well positioned for, for uh .. for wind power. Uh .. for historic reasons, SEA owns a lot of land on the ridges between the rivers. Uh .. and these uh .. areas make good sites for wind mills. A wind farm in a forest uh .. is a degraded land use. For many reasons. How can SEA manage that conflict, without being true to itself ? You say you want to improve the biodiversity, and then, the second pillar is industrializing the forests. Uh .. uh.. most of the forest, uh .. is outside of these wind parks, and it is unaffected by them. And then within the wind park, uh .. I mean the distances between these wind turbines is a matter of kilometers. Uh .. I myself, I, I hunt in an area which is a wind park and I mean for, from most perspectives, the forest in the wind park is the forest. There are roads there. There are wind turbines there. But the area that they sort of Mmm .. make use of, or industrialise if you want to um .. use that term, is fairly small, so most of the land even within the wind park is still forest. And there are some challenges, for example, when it comes to uh .. so .. some birds of prey and so on. But for most animals, and for all plants, I mean that the wind turbines have no effect whatsoever. Thank you for the pleasure to introduce (Tack så mycket för det var roligt till inte prantera) Alexandra Anstrell of the Moderate Party (Alexandra Anstrell Moderaterna) You have the floor: (Varsågod:) Thank you for your words, thank you, Minister of Defense. (Tack för uttarman, tack minister försvaret.) For me it is very important (För mig så är det väldigt viktigt) to highlight the disadvantages (att belysa på därför nackdelar) of expanded wind power. (med en utbyggd vind kraft.) It’s about the bigger picture (Det handlar om vad det betyder) and what this means in the future. (i ett svalt större perspektiv när det gäller.) Alexander, you asked some critical questions to the Parliament about the construction of wind power in Sweden or what exactly did you ask ? I ask the Minister if they have a a research about microplastic or if they have research .. enough research to know that we are taking the right steps into the future. But I didn’t actually get any good answers on that one. They said we have research, but not so much research. I think about the microplastic and uh .. about animals. But mostly, the steps into the future. We have to put the effects of uh .. the wind energy, to what are we doing to our nature, and to our people, and to the animals. And I didn’t got any good answers there. Does it give you concerns ? Yes, because I would like to take decisions, that I know are built on uh .. research, and not just that ... it could be good. We have to know it’s good as much as we can know, and I think, we can have some more research on this one. It’s quite a romantic vision. People living in nature, in the country being free. How do you see that conflicting with an uncertainty regarding the buildout of wind power, which clearly will conflict with many of these natural places, that people may want to move to. Very secure conflict there. Ah .. when we look at the expansion of wind power, and which areas are suitable and not suitable, we do it mainly from a nature conservation perspective. And there’s plenty of organizations which drive a kind of push against wind power, based on social impacts. Uh .. this makes my view ugly, or I can hear the noise, um .. which I fully respect, but it’s not part of our job. Uh .. when we go into the wind power debates today, we do it, because we know that we will have to get our electricity from somewhere in order to get rid of all of the fossil fuels. So that’s the sort of climate aspect of it, and, at the same time, we want to do this without contributing to further degradation of biodiversity and that means that we have to be a little bit more pragmatic, right ? So, we see that there is a need to build wind power. Let’s make sure that it’s built in areas with lower biodiversity sensitivity. And that’s possible. Is a forest with a wind farm, um .. equivalent to a forest without a wind farm ? There are definitely differences. I mean sort of the share of of the area that is, uh .. covered by roads, is higher in wind parks than it is in a forest, outside of the wind park, even though there are forest roads there as well. Uh .. and bear in mind that the, the share of the forest that i.. is in wind parks is very small compared to the rest of the forests. So you I could stop there, and say that it’s so small, it has no significant effect on on the large forest landscape. But if there are local effects that that uh .. from one or other reason uh .. would be severe. .. one good thing with wind turbines, is that you can put them down. In any case, it’s good to know we have that option right ? Yeah. What is the purpose and mission of the "Vinkraft Centrum" ? One of the purposes that we have, is to help to reach their goal of 100% renewable energy to 2040, and we also have a goal uh .. to help develop uh .. the village where the wind .. where the wind power are established .. yes .. And why is that so important ? Yeah, it creates new jobs. The wind power's uh ..for people living around there, during the operation and uh .. during the construction, it is important to reduce emissions. And so we need wind power. Yeah .. Yes. Everyone does. A piece of the puzzle: Vinkraft Centrum. You’re only focused on the economic side of a project. Local development benefit. You don’t look at any of the issues around noise or health or nature or those types of things .. You’re really about a, an economic development agency, focused on using wind to help local .. the people living there. Economic development, yeah. Yeah. If the paper says we will create 20 jobs, uh .. which the developer might say, but then it turns out that the 20 jobs are foreign workers. So no one then checks in the material sense: did those twenty jobs actually, um .. did they actually happen ? And that’s why, uh, uh, and that's just one question that .. you .. don’t have to answer if you don’t want to. But ... Who ... checks that the developers actually do what they promised at the beginning ? Yeah .. I actually do not know. But maybe you can talk to Tolvien, I think I think, you better note ... Is that ... he's my .. my boss .. OK. Let's see .. OK. Here we go .. OK ... Hello Tolvien, my name is Alexander Pohl. Ah .. we have spoken to Linea, and she had one or two questions that she referred back to uh .. that we should speak to you. Hej Tolvien, it’s Alexander Pohl again. Just trying to catch you to finish up this interview ... Hej Tolvien, it’s Alexander Pohl trying to catch you for a third time. Um .. It would be great to to finish up the the interview we started with Linea .. I, I hope to speak to you soon .. Hej Då .. The region of Jämtland has taken a proactive role, in implementing wind power through the launch of the Power Region Initiative. Wind power is an industrial solution. And to be honest, with some negative impacts on the environment. And if it's a specialist who's reponsible for permitting and monitoring the construction of the wind farms, how does it ensure that these impacts are understood and monitored ? The application for a permit (Ansökan om tillstånd vid en etablering) is examined (den prövas vid) in accordance with the Environmental Code. (enligt miljöbalken.) It then says that (Ach den säger då att) a consultation must be carried out (han måste genomföras) together with the County Administrative Board, (tillsammans med Länsstyrelsen) with the municipality, individuals, (med kommunen, enskilda,) the general public and organisations, (personer och allmänhet och organisationer,) and authorities that may be concerned. (och myndigheter som kan bli berörda.) And then they announce their decision, (Och då meddela de sitt beslut,) and it obtains legal force. (att de vinner laga kraft.) But it is very common for it to be appealed, (Om det överklagas väldigt vanligt att överklagas,) and that process takes several years. (och den processen tar flera år.) Does that mean that old promises can be changed, because of new standards ? In the course of the process, (Underhåll processens gång så,) it is very often the case, that (har det väldigt ofta så att) technology has evolved. (tekniken har utvecklats.) Quite a lot has happened. (Det hänt ganska mycket.) We can come to new knowledge, (Vi kan har kommit till kommer ny kunskap,) and even new technology of, uh .. (och även då ny teknik hos .. äh ..) of wind power itself. (av själva vi ka oss wind kraften.) So ... round can become square ... and cheap ... can become expensive ... Saving the climate ... can become saving the corporates. Or better said, all this ... is a shot in the dark. But hey, we’re doing good, right ? So they went in 2008 through the financial crisis .. They went to the Länsstyrels (County Boards) ... And they said: Hey, can we build a wind farm with these turbines ? And back then everyone was desperate, and "Klimat" was new and stuff. So they said OK. Hey, you can do that. Then in 2015 they said: We're really sorry. We’re not going to make any money with this little stupid turbine. Now, the turbines can be much taller, so can we put it on a stick .. and then, make it much taller .. But, by the way, don’t worry about the new turbines, because they're so much higher, the birds will fly underneath. It’s much further away from the ground .. You don’t really need to worry about it. So they they said, OK, you can do that. They had to do some studies, but of course the company pays a company to do the study for them. So the studies are always ... "Everything is great", and then, when they build the wind farm, they do this here. So they went from this .. mm .. to this .. yeah .. And they never got an approval for this. If they would have asked for this at the beginning, they would have said: you guys are idiots. And so here now you can see, what the wind industry has given the local people. This is called .. uh .. vinkus. This is like a little grill place, where you you can sit outside on the island. They even .. uh .. splashed out for the outhouse In the background. So, you can even take a shit ... And then .. uh .. yeah, and then here you go. Ahh .. how beautiful .. the village. What do you look out onto ? Uh, and then yes, the wonderful view of all the wind turbines which will soon be repeated across .. all of this ... So this little donation from the, uh .. the wind farm money .. becomes an insult as they can sit and watch their village be uh .. overrun and destroyed by wind turbines ... They have not been the best, but hey, that’s that’s natural. The solution to the problem (Det lösning på problemet) for most of the people here (för de flesta som är här) There is now this problem, yes. (Det är en nu Det här problem .. ja) Thank you. My name is Alexander Pohl, um.. (Tack. Jag heter Alexander Pohl um...) I have to ask my question in English. OK. Because I’ve come from Jämtland, where we have the same. Yeah, my question is: how will these windfarms fix climate change, when they don’t calculate the CO2 that they’re going to save ? We'll come to you a little later (Vi kommer till er lite senare bara) if it comes to that question (om det kommer till den frågan) Who are you ? (Vem är du ?) No, but it is advisable. (Nej men alltså der är ju rådgivande.) The answer ... We don’t know. But all experiments are allowed in a global crisis. And everybody wants to do good. And do business ... And that is double trouble ... You have involvement in the early days of helping Greta Thunberg build her awareness platform. Could you tell me a little bit about it, because it’s been seen as a pivotal turning point in the climate debate. Yes, so I mean, what we are trying to .. what we want to do, is to help everyone, that are acting for the climate. It could be a business leader, grounding a large corporation. It could be a 15 year old girl outside the Swedish Ricksdag. Uh .. and uh.. I came to hear about this joint goal that uh .. that was supposed to start something, in outside the Swedish parliament. Uh .. so I wanted to go there and see what what it was all about, and uh .. I was expecting um .. uh, something very differently .. Uh, I, I was expecting kind of a group of kids, that they’re going to demonstrate .. uh .. shouting angry with science and all that activist stuff. But it was nothing like that. It was only a young girl sitting in uh .. at the side on the street. And I just stood there uh .. before approaching her, like uh .. taking in the situation, because it was so clear, that everyone on the street, they didn’t even look at her. They just walked by, carrying on with their business as usual. And there you have this .. child .. with a sign and, and this .. and the weight on the shoulder screaming: We need to change ! Uh so, so the greater fundament is both very much timing, and the picture of a child telling the truth. Do you therefore think that we need to have more friction and more .. No ! .. challenging ? No ! No, I don’t believe nothing at all. Uh .. we can’t portray people like enemies. Like portraying "Big Oil" as enemies. Or portraying Jeff Bezos as enemies. I don’t think he’s an evil person. I don’t think he’ll think that he can do better. Uh .. I, I don’t think we could have a bad person change, if you're portraying them as an enemy. Maybe they’re not going to change anyway, but if you take a big corporation .. it's I mean it’s based upon their employees. You have 1000 employees. And that means that if the organization is doing something wrong, the only ones that are going to change that organization, is the people inside. And if you're portraying all of them as bad people, they will be bad people. If you understand, or, or trying to nudge them to change, and if you see someone inside doing something great and helping that person, you would have a much, much higher probability to change that organization to not be bad anymore. I mean, organizations don’t want to be evil, but if they are evil, there’s still a lot of people working for them. Try to help the good ones win inside that company. So, we don’t have time to portray people, businesses, as our enemies. We need to talk to even dictatorships. We need to have them to do this, because we don’t have time to replace them. We don’t have time for war. We don’t have time for a loser, so we don’t have that time. We must act within how the world looks today, with the leaders we have today, and we need them to change. And if we are making enemies out of people, and and having a big conflict, I don’t believe that, that will help. That’s an interesting point of view. But it has to be said: this "we don’t have time" thing ... somehow forced me into a one way direction. I’m meeting Jens Orban, executive director of "Global Challenges Foundation." We’re helping out to meet against the global catastrophic risks. They like to reform organizations as WHO, or United Nations, as more powerful crisis platforms. And better said: a one world governance ... Jens, why are we needing more power to these organizations ? Because if you ask people on the globe, what are the biggest risks towards humanity, they will answer climate changes. And we have a Security Council that doesn’t deal with climate changes. So in that sense, some of these very good institutions are getting a little bit irrelevant. And in order for them to get relevant, they have to handle these issues as well, I would say. The United Nations is .. is not an elected body. Is there some type of model ? Um .. are you looking at reforming these organizations, and turn it into Democratic local citizen-led organizations ? Yes, they need to, because if you have some legal power, you have to have legitimacy. Today, the Security Council has legal mandates, so it could also be that they expand their legal matrix into other security risks. But if you want to make bigger shift, you also need to look into .. to the Constitutions and, and if you would have some sort of executive organ, this organ also has to have legitimacy, and then we need to talk about the development of of the general examples. So, it’s more mandated in a democratic way. And the reason I asked the question, is because it feels sometimes in society today, um.. the parties have to stick to a certain position, because they would be showing weakness of some type of .. I guess you could say non-purist motivation. And if you scale that to a global level, that builds in a lot of extra risks, that you may end up going down to the root of uh .. "Asbestos" Let’s say that everyone thought "asbest" is what’s the best viral target, and they put it in everything, from floors, cars, to God knows ... Yeah, I think we've .. we will always be wrong. And, and uh .. I mean, if somebody before said that the Earth was round, he was so wrong, that he had to be killed, because he challenged the, the, the scientific thoughts of that time. So I, I think we need a political system that can adjust, and a movement that could .. move with, with the different knowledge. So, but at the same time, we then need some place to discuss that. And I think democracy is, is the least bad system that we have found so far, because it could have uh, freedom of speech. It could have some sort of freedom of research, freedom of assembly and so on. But, I think that system has, has a better possibility in the long run, to adjust to new knowledge. I think authoritarian systems can do things fast, in a way, if it’s good for the leaders. But in the long run, I think we need the tracked institutions to, to adapt to new knol .. to new knowledge. You made some very good points about a direct democracy. On a global basis, the individual can plummet to insignificance or can be over prioritized. Does the Global Challenge Foundation have any view about .. the value of the individual within global governance ? Yes, very much. I think that for me, living here close to the Baltic sea, if uh .. if I see that the sea is polluted from a neighboring country, I would like to have the possibility to go to court with that country, with maybe with help from my country to see, how could this dispute be carried out. We are not doing that today, and the Baltic Sea is dying ... And sometimes, when you look at global decisions, you think they .. take away possibilities for individuals. I would say it’s often the .. the other way around, like, for instance the .. human rights that we have: Freedom of speech, freedom of assembly. They give freedoms for individuals not only to .. move around on the globe, but also to affect their policies. So I think that the policy decision on, on the global level to .. to, to large extent, should .. secure .. the freedom of the individuals, but at the same time, you as an individual need some sort of place on the global level, also to secure your future. And, and, and if decisions will affect you, you need some sort of democratic path also to have an influence on that. But to say I decide myself, so I stay in my village. I don’t think that’s the right answer today, because there is a road from that village. There is air coming to that village. There is water coming into that village, that you as an individual also need to .. have some sort of influence on. Global governance: a good idea ? I don’t know. Because who at the end decides whether there is a crisis .. Based upon what, and who is steering it ? How many rights do we have .. to go against the narrative ? Because a crisis doesn't have time .. for a democratic system. You know all people we met so far were pretty interesting, but all conversations we had, were sort of based upon the premise that climate change will kill us. Therefore, we need to get rid of fossil fuels, and we need to build a lot of renewable energy, right ? It’s true, though .. The fundamental underlying question is: Do we need all this energy and electricity in the first place ? Yeah .. I .. I’ve got enough electricity. Do you have enough electricity ? I think most citizens have enough electricity, and even if you go to the developing world, they probably have enough electricity. So who needs all this extra electricity ? You know it’s .. it’s not, it’s not necessary, it’s just factories and heavy industry that are building things, that people don’t need. To drive the, you know, the capitalist model, which is owned by, you know, just a few people. So I just I do get frustrated by the fact that they’re telling us that we’re all gonna die. Uh .. in response to something, that no one has actually asked if we actually need ... So, and people talk about putting a price, a price on carbon, a price on nature. Uh, but that means that you treat them like commodities, right ? As long as you can pay the price, you can use it and actually, this using and abusing, you know. ru .. raping nature, it’s disgusting and no price can make that OK. But .. we need to figure out how to get these individuals to no longer be motivated by money ... Greta, before you get started, I’m doing a documentary film to save forests. I’ve come from Jämtland, from up north. You’ve spent almost three years now, raising the alarm, and you’ve met .. you know you’ve met Obama. You’ve met all these politicians. You met a lot at the World Economic Forum etc ... Um .. I’m proud of you, and I think that you raised the alarm. Um .. what do you think is the next step ? Because we know who’s to blame. We know we’ve got the, the climate and ecological emergency, which I call a resource consumption, land use, and a pollution emergency. But people kind of get confused by that. Um, what do you think is the next step ? Raising awareness. Raising awareness ? Yeah. That's our goal and we still haven’t achieved that. Um, we have a level of awareness right now which is close to non-existing. Yeah. And, in order to make any changes whatsoever .. we need to raise the level of awareness. Because, if we don’t have people who are aware in the official chain, then we won't see that change. That is such a good point. Hey. Good stuff ... Hey. The other conspiracy, the other fraud, the other exploitation. Where there is fear, there is money. I'm a 20 year banker. Trying to tell the truth. Hey !!! ... Shame on you ! Shame on you ! Shame on you ! Shame on you ! Shame on you ! Shame on you ! Shame on you ! Shame on you ! ... Hi, you've reached the voice mail of Alexander Pohl. Please leave a message ... The moment a democratic global governance has selected the crisis and the route ... It starts to protect it. And sees the public doubt as a threat to disrupt, on which totalitarianism falls ... Hello ! I’ll be interpreting for you this morning and sworn to silence. OK. OK .. um .. Okej, ..... We want to start our questioning and it will take place at 10:00 the 19th .. Excuse me .. Wait .. Can .. can I just can I just um .. can I just ask a few questions first ? Um .. I don’t know who .. you are. I don’t have any evidence, of who this is .. Uh, I don’t have a telephone number. I briefly got the name .. of the, the person who’s supposedly calling me. Can I please get details of who, who you are ? What evidence I have, of who you are ? Um .. because, I feel very uncomfortable being called out of the blue, um, on an unlisted number, with someone suggesting they are the police. You are suspected of a crime called refusing arrest .. refusing .. resistance. Why ? Why is this ? Why is this taking place three months .. after whatever we are referring to ? Because it takes time for us to investigate minor things .. Hopefully, we can finish this incident today. I have to admit, um .. No one has told me .. what my rights are. I don’t .. um, I feel very uncomfortable, because of the experience that I had. And the fact that the police is now accusing me of a, a crime, um .. when I was not arrested, um .. Excuse me .. excuse me .. the police was not accusing .. If I translated wrong. It was, it was a suspicion, not an accusing .. Indeed but, based on what happened, if I am now being suspected of a crime, um, that makes me feel very uncomfortable, and I don’t know what my rights are, um .. So I, I would not like to proceed without knowing what my rights are, having appropriate representation. Um .. and I would prefer to do this in person um, so that I can be .. so that I, I know what’s going on. But .. I do not feel comfortable to do this type of thing on the telephone. So, so you will have your rights, all according to, to the system, the plan, once we start the questioning .. But we haven’t started, we haven’t started the questioning yet. No. He informed exactly when it would start in the beginning of the conversation .. Exactly. So I do not feel comfortable having .. uh, being questioned, um .. at present, because I did not .. I was not aware that this was a formal questioning. Um, I, I, I, I do not, as I said, I do not feel comfortable answering questions under these circumstances. Um, I’ve .. What are my options ? ... I’m taking charge here. I’m going to start, and first, I’m going to inform you about your rights ... No, no. .. Yes .. No, I do not feel comfortable with this. I will come to Stockholm if I have to and sit in a room with you. Um, I’m, I’m .. The police treated me very badly. I filed a complaint about the treatments. Um, I feel that I’m being treated badly again here. Uh, it’s suggested that this is a minor, a minor situation. I don’t understand why I’m being forced into having .. answering questions, that I don’t feel comfortable with .. because I don’t understand the situation. You will be able to express your discomfort during this questioning. However, like I said, I, I don’t want to be questioned like this. When I .. this experience is, is is, it was, it was one of the scariest things I have ever experienced and certainly did not expect it of the police in Sweden ... .. this is, this is the fact .. Meanwhile, you are suspected of a crime. .... Swedish police officer .... That's the situation, and there’s nothing you can do to decide about the formalities ... Hello ... ? I’m not ..I’m not able to take this call. I, I have to go. This is it, I can’t handle this. This is too much for me. I’m .. I’m sorry you’re going to have to .. You’re gonna have to call me back. I can’t I can’t take this .. OK, bye bye. Three months later they call you out of the blue. Say you are suspected of a crime. I, I never experienced anything like that. You know, six guys in gas masks .. Don’t even say anything. In silence, grab you from behind. They they don’t speak, you know, they pinned me down for 15 minutes, handcuffed me brutally. Smashed my uh .. everything that I had with me .. They treat me like I’m a piece of dirt. Um .. and all I did was just .. get freaked out by .. by six guys in gas masks. And now they’re calling me, and say that I have no rights. Um, I’m, I’m, I, I had to hang up, because I can’t. I can’t. I can’t deal with that. If they want me .. they can come and get me. But I mean, this is police brutality of the uh .. you know intimidation. Total intimidation. I can’t .. I can’t .. I can’t talk to them. Lawsuits, problems with the police. You lost friends .. I mean, how far are you willing to go, to you know, reach your own justice ? Yeah .. I've asked myself that .. pretty much every day now. It’s really hard going, but .. I feel like if I don’t give it one big push .. and I’m almost at the crest .. You know, either I’ll find the truth, and uh, that will set me free. Or, you know, I gave it my best and I failed. And then I kind of just move on with my life. But I feel like I’m close. Hopefully, I won’t end up in jail. But uh, you know, that, that would be for .. for reasons outside of my control. You know. But, you know .. one way or the other I will .. I will end up somewhere. You’re hungry ? .. Cool. Our world is freedom ... and its future is at stake ... we must build back better, but better for the good ... Have we to turn the tide, yes ... Have we to turn the tide, yes ... Our world keeps spinning ... It is time to pull the brake ... We must come together and reset for the good ... Have we to turn the tide, yes ... Have we to turn the tide, yes ...
