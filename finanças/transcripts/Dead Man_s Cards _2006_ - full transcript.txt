Has he told you what the wages are? - No. - Right. It's 20 during a weekday, which you work on your own. And then it's uh, 25 on weekends, but you don't start until 11. So you get the same as someone who starts at six. And you get a complimentary drink on the house. - Sound. - It's alright... As long as you don't get pissed. That was Cole Youngers that. - Really? - Yeah. I bought it from a fella who's Uncle was given it by a Yank, Sailor from Missouri. That's the gods honest truth. Come on.

Argh! Fucking bit my hand! - Ah! Get him off me! - Look at me! Look at me! Get off! Get off! Out the back! There's cameras in the front. Who are you phoning? - The police. - What fucking planet are you from? You say nothing! Understand? See nothing, know nothing. Do you hear me? - Do you hear me? - Yeah... Everybody off! Back off. He's had enough. Are you alright matey? Well cop for that. You're gonna fucking kill him! Leave it out Paul! Oh, fucking hell. You take from me. I take from you. Ten years of pain, mother fucker.

You were swinging wild. I never. Take no notice, he just doesn't want to up your wages. You did alright kidda. Just don't expect any praise from round here. Bling. Are we going on a holiday or what? Cos we're in deep water now. Do 'em the dirty lads. Do 'em the dirty! What's that about? That's Billy the Cowboy man. I'm in up to me fucking eyeballs here. He pays us protection if we don't deal with this, we'll be a laughing stock. Who's laughing? All I'm saying is get him on the firm, we need guys like Paul. What about Romeo? Give him a bung, tell him we dropped it on Paul's toes, and he's coughed up, it'll soften the blow. I ain't putting my hand in my pocket. Well tell him he's gotta cough up, look he'll forget it. He'll be having murder with someone else next week. But he's had a bitch slap and ended up in intensive care, for fucks sake! Your mates got no sense of what's right or wrong. You don't know who you're dealing with. With. Okay so the club's a shit hole, but don't mistake who Paul is. This is his idea of fun. Three tours of duty in Northern Ireland. I've done one with him, I'm telling you, he's the type of man you look to in a situation. Romeo's got dough, but he'll end up getting us all down the swanny. What do you want me to tell you, because I won't lie? You can tell me what you like, but when Romeo's out troubles on its way, and ya know it. Back of the queue lads, alright. He's slipped that under my nose the sly old bastard. What's the problem? You book the wrong music, you get the wrong crowd. You book R n B, or Drum and Base, you get all the Fifty Cent wannabe's from the area. Book this shite and every ginger nut, trumped up coke dealer in the city will be here. This particular night soft arse booked in no one will touch with a shitty stick, not even Chongi. There's always murder at it. ♪ If you're all not in it ♪ ♪ we could have wedding bliss ♪ ♪ if we'd all be beginning ♪ ♪ I'm feeling low down ♪ ♪ you know what I'm talking about ♪ Sorry lads, your mates wearing trackies, you can't come in. Since when has this gaff had a dress code? There's only one with trackies, let them in. There's only one with trackies, let him in! You sure about that? Let them in. Alright, it's your shout. Whatever you say. Watch your look. - What's this now? - What's up? I give this ten minutes, before it kicks off. - Let's go and get them-- - Whoa, hold your horses, Geronimo. How'd you think I survived so long? They're in now, let them kick off, then we'll pick up the pieces. And I know for sure that, that little twat in there is a shooter. Get off me! Hey, hey. Buddy. Stop! No! Get off! Get him off! Get off, get off! Put the gear away, put the gear away! Somebody help! Somebody do something! Fucking help us! You fucking idiots, one you fucking do something. Fucking do something! Help him! Please, stop! I'll suck the cock of any man, who will tell me his pin number. All that dosh, loads of it. You're too much, I can't believe the mouth on you. I just spiked his ale with half a gram of wiz, and a liquid Viagra. That should get things moving very nicely. You're going straight to hell, he's a married man. Who wants to sit on a fluffy cloud. Nah, I know what I want, and I'm not afraid to get it. I tell you what. I'm gonna get us some extra dollar for that. Set us up Billy. He's a fucking hero, this man. Not yet, I'll tell you when he has. He's just holding it. He's so pissed. He's holding it. He's drinking it... My eyes killing me. Go on, go on. I might as well join to his arm. Billy, what's your answer? It's OK. So it's true... Randolph Scott was getting stuck up Audie Murphy on a regular basis. Hold on, hold on, you've got that one wrong. It wasn't Audie Murphy. Audie Murphy was the most decorated man of his country. Audie Murphy was a crackerjack Marine for Christ sakes, I mean he was a war hero. Well who was it then? It was Tyrone Power. That's him, that's him. Tyrone Power, Zorro! Yeah that's it. Hey, hey. I'll tell you who else was as bent as a nine bob note, Lee Marvin. Oh fuck off, I'm not having that. You're not telling me that Lee Marvin was gay. I'm not having it! It's true, Lee Marvin used to go shopping in a floral dress. Can I have a napkin? I'm glad you're home. I want to do something today. Like a normal couple. We need to talk to somebody. Don't ignore me 'cos at least I'm trying. What should I say? My husband the big time boxer... blew all his money, got poxed up. And now he's infertile and for some reason I'm feeling a little bit resentful? I let you down badly. Let's just change the subject. I don't wanna change the subject. You know I could put my hand in the fire and watch the fucking thing burn. You have no idea... How I feel. That's why I think it's time we went and spoke to somebody, but you're so fucking ignorant. Hey, come on, come on. Talk to me. Come and finish your tea. Tell me how you feel. - Do you really want to know? - Yeah. I feel like someone's booted me in the back. That's alright, because that's just the usual period pain. It's much worse than that. I feel like death. Because this month is the anniversary of last month. And every fucking month... I hope I won't come on, and it's all your fucking fault. You fucking soft bastard. Kris! Kris, wait! Just leave me alone. Leave me alone! Fucking leave me alone! You fucking-- Fucking-- Take your fucking wedding ring. - Bang, bang you're dead. - Hey kid, fuck off. Mom! Hey you, what's wrong with you? You freak? Picking on a kid. Go and get my fella for you, shall I? Well go get your fucking fella. Anyway what you doing bringing your kid up to shoot people for? You dense bastard? I can't believe you've done that. Read the sign, ya smackhead! Wanker. Hey... Hey mate, I know you... Hey! Could ya see your way to help a fella out who's, who's down on his luck and... Please. Okay buddy. Oh thank you mate, thank you! Any small amount will help, it's my dear... dear Mother... Back home in Belfast. She's fallen ill, she's got nobody to help her. I need to get a ticket back there before it's too late. And go no-one here... That's either the saddest story I've ever heard. I've ever heard, or the worst lie. Either way you deserve that. Aw bless you mate, bless you. I'll never forget this. I'll do you a favor back one day. You'll see! Night lads... Aye Paul... What's up mate? I can't work Billy's Bar no more. Not in that hell hole. I don't want to let you down Paul. I like you. You're sound. But I tell ya, I don't know what I was thinking. Listen, I've seen you in that ring... You had balls of steel man. What's the matter with you? There's nothing wrong with you. You'll be OK, trust me. I've seen a lot of life. Now common. It'll be alright. So you want me? - Give us your hand. - Why? You'll see. Uh... Spread your fingers. Like it? - How much? - Mmm. To you a kiss. Come here. No more Jargune gems, for my baby. What the fuck are you up to? There you go. The real McCoy. - Looks like a piece of junk. - Oh, listen to him! Some people have got no taste. That soft arse is worth five and it's yours for sweet F.A. Oh yeah? It's too much. It's my present, I want you to have it. - I don't want it. - Don't kick a gift horse in the mouth. Look babe, don't expect too much from me. I'm a married man. I know, I know that and I don't care. Just take it as someone to be nice to you, OK. If ever you need a shoulder to cry on, you know you can come to me any time. I'm fine with that. Don't think I don't appreciate it, cause I do. It's just, I don't want you to... - to get carried away. - Get you, big head... Who's getting carried away? - We're just mates, aren't we? - Yeah. So take the ring and the watch and don't insult me, OK? OK. Don't I get a kiss then? Oh, just a thank you kiss? Fucking hell. Don't spoil me, will ya? Is that mine? - It's right. - Don't you look lovely in that! That'll keep you dead warm on the door. Don't you know? - It's right! - Yeah? I just don't think I can take it anymore. You and Tom should talk. Get counselling. We've talked and talked, we've had treatment, counselling. It's an impossible situation. Not for me, for him. I think you should get out, get your life back. Took me a long time, after I left Rachel. But it was worth it in the end, because I just didn't love the woman. Kris... Are you OK? Yeah. Oh, it's you Tom. Come in. That's crunched a lot of bones, that has matey. You waiting for world war three, or what? Toys, just toys matey. What's that? That, is our queen. Why? Because I watched my back for her. Eighteen years with a bunch of racist motherfucker. And that earned me the right to hang it there. So are you a Prody then? Orange through and through. The sash my father wore. That's me kiddo, Mr. Fucking awkward. It's Bob. Chongi wants us to join his firm. Pass me, me boots over. Help me get into them. Well? I'll think about it. Don't fuck with my ear Paul, I'm not a banjo you play a tune on. Yeah? Extra twenty for what? Selling drugs to kids? I might be cabbage looking, but I ain't no fucking turnip! No, none of that. We're strictly legit. Oh I'm sorry, is that a fucking flying pig I see up there? Listen I'm doing you a favor, getting you out of a major situation... And putting an extra dollar in your pocket. Don't kick a gift horse in the mouth! Yeah? Well here's my answer. You tell Chongi, if he fucks with me he'll be pissing blood out of his fucking arse! Do I look worried?! Eh? Do I look fucking worried? Oi! This is your friend talking. I went through the same shit you did, and I'd be there for you if I could! You're fucked! - Alright. - Here's the paper. Cheers. - How much is there? - 500. - You sure that's 500. - 500. - Jimmy, does that look five? - 500. Right. What are you doing tonight? Going to the club. OK. Any chance? Oh Jimmy, I wanna get a bath and wash my hair, and I'm a bit tired, I need some kip. - Alright. - OK. - See you later. - OK. - See ya. - Ta. Who was that? Never mind. Tidy few quid. I've got this if anyone tries to take it. You're nuts. Let's have a look at that. You could make a few quid you know, if you stopped listening to everything your uncle Paul says. How? Easy, just start knocking a few people out and demanding it. What's this? It's cool. I'm grafting with Mary, my woman. You're out of order. Smoke it outside. Fuck off! Do what the man says or I'll part your hair with this bottle. You're all right, you. But I'm not sure about this prick brother. - I'm not your brother. - It's alright he's with me. It's ok Tom, just leave it. Leave it, Jimmy. What the fuck are you doing Jimmy? You're really fucking bringing it on top for me do you know that? You're gonna get me the chop. Those two pricks are living on borrowed time. It's so fucking blatant what you were doing. You were winding them up. Hit me with a fucking duster. Robbed me wallet, my chain! My fucking chain! And now he's fucking with your man Jimmy! I want him done! This is bad for business. I'm not asking you, I'm fucking telling you! Don't point that at me. And I'm telling you, don't you ever point a gun at me again. You're getting soft Chongi, man. You're like a soft business man. And I'm from the street. If something's not done about this... every knob head that comes along is going to think he can us off. And what am I supposed to do lads, grease my arse like a fucking bitch? Hey. Church is over there. You alright Bob. How's Tommy? Not too bad. Want some? Yeah go ahead. I've got no beef with you, you know. Here. How long have you got before work? Couple of hours, why? I wanna show you something. - Oh yeah. - Yeah. What's the matter? Don't you trust me? Paul won't push. He's got rocks in his skull. That's right. But the time is right, for someone like you. You could be head doorman for a new gaff, we're opening. You could take home ten grand cash from the Christmas bucket, after you've chased some upstairs to me and Chongi. And all you have to do is turn the other cheek every once-in-a-while. Fuck me, that sounds good. Open your eyes mate, you're living in the dark ages. Welcome to the here and now Tommy! The Marquis of Queensbury is dead. This, is what it's all about! Kicking in are we? Anyway... this is all small potatoes. I've got a sure fire winner, going down with a big time property developer, for serious wedge. All legit and all by the way. And I take it your man Chongi's, none the wiser? Correct, and do you know what? Even if someone let slip, he wouldn't believe them anyway. - Alright Chongi. - Bob. - Chongi you know Tom don't ya? - Course I do. You alright Tom? Good to have you on board. Come on. Get on. This could be good for all of us if it's done right you know. Get on this Tom. How much cash you got on you Chongi? Nice. This is small change mate, and how much have you got on you? Fuck all. Exactly. Now this could be yours, and working with us no fucker would ever take it from you. Ever. Here. Take it. Go on. No strings. No sweat. There's plenty more where that came from. I know how things should be done. That's good to hear, because it needs doing, right now. Here! It's not friendly like this over in Northern Ireland you know. Oh here we go! Soldier bullshit! It's not bullshit mate, I've been there remember. Those IRA boys are bad. Piss off those crazy Prody bastards in East Belfast, and if they're feeling charitable they warn you with a bullet in an envelope. And if they're not, which is most of the time... They shoot you in the head before they even worry about whether you're the right fucking person or not. And that's the truth. Paul would know all about that wouldn't he? Being in to all that orange shit. He had a rep over there true enough. Well he would do wouldn't he. It's not often you see a crazy black man down the Shankhill road. Chalky Mandella, they called him. Well Chalky Mandella ain't on Shankhill road anymore. If you don't get me a result pronto, you need to back away. Cause gonna start making Billy's Bar my local. Hey Tom... What's that Paul? I've been thinking about this lot, you know. Yeah? Yeah. I just want to say I appreciate you standing by me y'know? This is my shit, and I'm asking you to step down while you can. What do you mean? You're sound Tom. You're sound you know? But this kind of shit, one way or another... Turns you bad, without you even knowing it. And I'd hate to think, of that happening to you. No way Paul! I'm there for you, it's just.... What? Well, I think we should throw in with Chongi. That's all. I see. I mean what's the big problem? We'd be making big dough. We met before you know, a long time ago. When? When you beat that Yank, got your title shot. I came into your dressing room afterwards.... You were fucking buzzing, you know? Everyone wanted a piece of ya! You don't remember this, but I offered you a wedge... You wouldn't take it. I've never forgotten that... How much did they offer ya? I was gonna be a world champion, remember? Remember? And what I know now, I'd be a bit of your fucking hand off! You know? You know, cleaned up. Tickets to all the fights, that kind of thing. You got any kids? What? What are you going on about? I do. A daughter. She died in a junkie flat. Hooked on smack. I never even knew. I was too busy making a fortune selling the stuff. I don't even know if her fix came from me. But it may as well have done. Soon I... I'd understand better than most if you throw in with that lot. But if you do... Just make sure you give me a wide birth, aye? Yo Who's this? - It's Tom. - Tom. What's going on? Count me out Chongi.
