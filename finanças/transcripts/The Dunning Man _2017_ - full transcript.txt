I can put you in touch with someone. They might make you an offer, OK? It would get you out of the hole. Hell, you might even make some money. Think about that, huh? Don't walk away. I'm giving you an opportunity here. You asked me for help. Whoa! Oh, my name is Jock Stewart. I am a canny gun man and a roving young fellow I've been. So be easy and free when you're drinking with me. I'm a man you don't meet every day. Well, I took out my dog and him I did shoot all down in the county Kildare. So be easy and free when you're drinking with me. I'm a man you don't meet every day. So come fill up your glasses of brandy and wine. Whatever it costs, I will pay. So be easy and free when you're drinking with me. I'm a man you don't meet every day. So be easy and free when you're drinking with me. I'm a man you don't meet every day. Christ, kid. What happened to you? You stumble drunk or you lose a fight? Hey. That little thing? Just some rough loving. Whoa. Big women. Hey. Named Herman. Oh, god. That's disgusting. Ugh. Let's just say my last few days in New York sucked. We'll leave it at that. Yeah. So uh, I guess you found some other place to live. I mean, you called me. You say you might need a place, and then I call you back and I don't hear nothing. No matter how many messages I leave for you... OK, I'm a shithead, all right? But yeah, I got an apartment at Beachgate. I'm going to stay over there. Empty units. That's not good. You got something else going? I got one tenant. I barely charge him enough to cover the mortgage. Yeah, well, that's smart. Thank you for that. But I got another one I just leased. Short term, big money. How big? $3,000 a month for six months. At Beachgate? No, no, no. Something fishy going on there. I need the cash. Didn't I tell you not to invest your own money in those properties? Yeah. Lost all Ursela's money on that other deal. Shit, what's safer than invested in New York City? It's a fucking island for Christ's sake. So's Atlantic City. Bottom fell out of here a dozen times over. But if you kept your money out, it'd be somebody else holding... this does give me the opportunity to say, I told you so. But at least you're out clean, right? I still owe Ursela. About $20 grand. $20 grand, ladies and gentlemen! $20 grand. Well, you're on your own, kid. No, I'm not asking you for the money. But thanks, Uncle. Now tell me, how's she coming after you for it? Shit, she don't even want it. All right. She's not pissed off about the money, so how come you guys aren't together right now? I don't know. I guess I feel bad about it. Oh, get over your fucking self! Please! Please, go back to the rich girl. Ask her to stake you again. I mean, she's a fucking faucet. And that ass of hers... Stop, all right? That's just wrong on so many levels, you old man. You know people need money, right? Yes, of course, I know people need money. Just... I hate thinking that the best I got coming for me is being Mr. Roper. You're not going to be Mr. Roper. Don't worry about that. Mr. Roper had a wife. You're... you're like that other guy, the alone fuck. Mr. Furley, you depressing fuck... What's your plan? Well, the first thing I'm going to do is try and get in shape. - Bought myself a bike. - Oh, yeah. I hear there's a lot of money in that. No, I... a real plan. Is there still a game at Lucky's? Oh, that's a bad plan. I've got to pay my mortgage. Well, sell the piece of shit condos and cash out. No. That's the only thing I've ever done on my own. That was with my money. Yeah, bullshit. I know why you want to keep them. But if you want to gamble, go to the casinos. Hit on the fish. No. Casinos are falling apart, just like the rest of this town. You know what I should've done, I should've gone to Vegas. Oh, fuck Vegas. You know, that's as phony as fucking Disneyland. They've got gondola rides. They've got an Eiffel fucking Tower. It's a copy of 100 fucking different things. And you know the first thing they copied, A fucking C, baby. Atlantic City. This is the real fucking deal. Pick the right party, get the night started. She carrying the fake if they try carding. Every night is the same mission, living life like we about to hit the age limit. Says she do it for the if she could get hit off a gram or a line. Taking vodka shots, selfies at the popular spots. Fuck. Hey, Alice. Well, if it isn't Connor Ryan. Whoa. Wait, what happened to your eye? Don't ask. Uh, brought you something. It's for the banging. This is a noise machine. Noise I got. Helps with the other noise. Just going to plug it in. Thunderstorms, I don't know what else. Ooh, shamanic flutes. Shamanic flutes? - That's what it said. - I'm excited. You ready? Yes. Sounds real. Fuck me, Daddy. Now, in my baby hole. Oh, you meant banging. Mm-hmm. Baby hole. Their bedroom's on the second floor. How... how do you hear it down here? I don't know, but Ava hears it too. She's nine, Connor. I ain't trying to let her hear all that. Yeah, I know. That's messed up. Yeah. Listen, they're not my tenants, but I'll go talk to them. Yes, please. Tell them to bite a pillow, at least. The girl was yelling like a cat in heat when I got home from work. Shit didn't even sound fun. Probably wasn't. I mean, you know... Hey, baby. You and these braids. What you doing at school that your hair looks like this at the end of the day. Hi, Ava. Hey. Hello, Mr. Ryan. Hello, Mr. Ryan. What's that in your hand? It's a good luck charm. I made it. Oh, do you know how badly I need one of those right now? Yeah. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Oh, here's my bookbag. Excuse me? Sorry. Mm-hmm. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye, Mr. Ryan. Bye, Ava. All right. I got to take off. But listen, I'm going to go check in on the upstairs. I mean, she can't be hearing about baby holes. Hey, before I go, um, do you think I could get the rent check for this month? You know what? Why don't you come back and tell me how it goes with the kama sutra club upstairs, and I'll get you then. Yo, who is it? It's Connor Ryan. I own the, uh, unit downstairs. Karma Lion? All right, come on up, Karma Lion. Atlantic City, bitch. Atlantic City, bitch. Atlantic City, bitch. We don't give a shit. On the beach, getting raunchy with a ..

Karma Lion. What's that, a stage name or something? Uh, it's Connor, actually. C... Connor Ryan. Yeah, but, but, but that sounds kind of nice, right? Karma Lion. Karma Lion. Who is this cat? Karma Lion? He's just this cat. Just this cat. Karma Lion. Good band name. Yeah. Maybe. Um, album title. Yeah. Yeah. Hey. You need something pressed? What? Oh. He the one that kicked shit on your car? I... no, I didn't. I mean, I... OK, wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. So you come here to apologize? No, actually. I came... No? So what? Kicking shit on a man's car doesn't warrant a sorry about that? Or is that just for a white man's car? I just came up to ask you a favor, OK? And now I just... this is fucking nuts. Yeah. I'm just fucking with you. He's about to walk out. Where the fuck you going? Hey, hey, hey. It's just dog shit, all right? I mean, she said you cleaned it off, right? Yeah. I mean, what else can you ask a man to do besides take care of his own shit? In this case... Dog shit. There you go. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. What can I do for you, Karma Lion? Are you William Jones? Yeah. Yeah, that's me. D... do you want to go downstairs and maybe just talk down there? I mean, I don't... I don't want to disturb her, uh, her work. We good. We cool, right, baby? Always. OK, um, the thing is, I have a couple apartments in here. Three, actually. And I got one right below you. And there's this... there's this really, really sweet lady who lives down there... Ooh! That honey-coated sister with the pretty face? Yeah, yeah. That's her. Alice. Nice. You... you... you... you hitting that? No, I just... I just rent my unit to her. Shit, I'd rent my unit to her too. It's not like that. Give her a long lease. You know what I'm talking about? Listen, the thing is, she's been complaining about the, uh, the love sounds. Love sounds? Yeah. You mean fucking? Cause what we be doing in here is fucking. Yeah, I guess that's it. I guess that's right. You saw Bree downstairs, right? Sharon here. What you expect a man to do? OK. Well, uh, the thing of it is, see, she's got... she's got a nine-year-old girl, right? She's got a shorty down there. Yeah. Hey... Yeah. My... my bad. And those... those sounds, they're... they're difficult to... to, uh... Shit. ...categorize for a kid, you know? Mm. I bet. So maybe we could try and keep it... keep it down? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. OK. Thanks. Thanks... Yeah. Jesus. AC, bitch. Yeah. I'm sorry. At least they're not in my ceiling. What about my AC? Yes, yes. Um, does it work anywhere? Oh, the bedroom is a furnace. Getting to where I've been keeping my drawers in the freezer like Marilyn. You put your underwear in the freezer... I pay for air conditioning. OK. You're right. I'm on it. I promise. Oh, these are good. I'm on it. I promise. Did you make these too? I piddle a little. Oh, come on. A dog? You know the rules! You're going to upcharge me for a dog? Really? I'm broke. That's $150 bucks. Shouldn't I? Come on. Ava loves that dog. And I already wrote you the check for this month. And... and maybe it wasn't even a dog you heard. I mean, as far as you know. Maybe it wasn't. I'll see you later. Wait a sec. Here. Luck charm. Thanks. What's up, Jerod. Ryan. Uh, how's the, uh, the limo thing going? Why, you going to write a book? Connor's here about the air. Good. Connor. Shit's getting hot in here. Best hop to it, landlord. Throwing money on the dance floor. Shorty, what you spend a couple grand in the club, empty hand to the landlord. We be getting it for damned sure. Getting it for damned sure. G... getting it for damned sure. Say you want to party, pop that molly, grab a handful. We getting it for damned sure. G... getting it for damned sure. Say you're trying to get hot. We got and more. What's up? Did you deposit the check from the new tenants yet? No. No, I'm not coming to a golf course. I just need to know if you put the check in the bank. Gillian, I'm not coming to a fucking... Yes! Gil, you know I love you, but you're horrible, and you drive me fucking insane. Relax and enjoy your life, honey, or you're going to have an aneurysm. I do relax, all right? I do enjoy my life. No, you don't. You're so stressed about last week or next week, you never enjoy the middle. What's up with your scorecard, by the way? You've got fucking smiley faces all over it. Those are the holes I'm happy with. I have some frowny faces too. Why so angry today? Because I got zippo fucking money in the bank, that's why. I should have, what? $6... $6 grand, security rent from what's your name? Erika Dietz-Hoffman. Whatever. Where's my money, Gil? I sent you an email. Her air conditioning doesn't work. Oh, her too. Fucking... these fucking air conditioners. They won't pay till it's fixed. So what? She hasn't paid me anything? I didn't want to sign her, sweetie. She won't put the lease in her name, no utilities in her name. - I said, there's something fishy. - OK, look. Her dad owns the bank. That's where they keep the fucking money. I'm just saying, I don't trust show people. The deposit never covers the damage. What do you mean, show people? She's got a magic animal act at the Taj Mahal for a few months. Magic animals? Magic and animals. It's called Untamed Illusions. Shit. I'll send another notice today. I need more than a notice, Gil. I'm about to lose everything, and the bank is coming at me with the fucking F word. That's your favorite word. Fore-fucking-closure. I have her lawyer's number, Sandone. All right. Look, give me that. I'll go check on these piece of shit air conditioners. Come hit a golf ball before you go. You'll feel better. Not a fucking chance, Gil. Credit card's declined. What'd you do? Run the whole thing? No, I just ran the half I need up front. You take a check? On a declined credit card? No. Come on, man. Listen, my rent is due in, like, two days. Can you just cut me some slack? I'm sorry, man. I got two chihuahuas at home to feed. Jesus Christ. Christ. The fuck? Oh, shit! Fuck! A tiger? You have a fucking tiger in my apartment? The fuck! Who are you? I'm your fucking landlord, freako. Landlord? Freako? This is my apartment. You... you rent me! You... you. No! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You not leave. Oh, I leave. I leave. I very much fucking leave. Fuck! You take off clothes. What? You take off clothes! The fuck is wrong with you? Ferdinand. Who this? Something wrong? We got problem. JOSEPH This is Joseph Sandone. What the fuck is happening in my apartment? JOSEPH That sort of language isn't helpful, Mr. Ryan. No. No, I... what the fuck is happening? There... there is thousands of dollars worth of damage! JOSEPH Calm down, please. Your clients have a tiger in my apartment. And that's not the fucking weirdest shit I've seen in there! JOSEPH What can I say? They're cat people. Listen, those crazy ass fucking Russians... JOSEPH Ramos and Ferdinand are Chechen warriors. I don't give a fuck what they are! That doesn't matter. JOSEPH Oh, no? The big guy? He tried to get me to take my clothes off. That matters. And I'm calling the fucking police. That fucking matters! JOSEPH You're way out of your depth. Are you kidding me? JOSEPH I'm not. You know you're late on your fucking rent, right? JOSEPH Not when the air conditioning doesn't work. Air? JOSEPH Air. Air. JOSEPH Exactly. Do you know your clients dress up like animals... JOSEPH No, I don't. But I do know the lease states that all appliances will be kept in working order. Oh, that's your game? JOSEPH This is not a game. That's your fucking game, dickhead. Well, guess what? You're going to pay me my fucking rent, you're going to clean up my fucking apartment, and you're going to get the fucking crazies out of there, or I'm going to call the police. And then I'm going to shut off the fucking power that your client wouldn't put in her own fucking name! JOSEPH That's pretty scary, Mr. Ryan, but you're also lacking a certificate of occupancy, which you are required to have. A what? JOSEPH Which you are required to have. If the police become involved, that will be reported, and you'll most certainly face a fine and a substantial legal fee. Fuck you and your fine. JOSEPH I don't think you're hearing me. Rules don't concern them. They're warriors in the spirit of the wolf. They don't fear death. They attack when they're wounded. Trust me, today should best be considered a misunderstanding. Are you shitting me? JOSEPH Good day, Mr. Ryan. Fuck me. I couldn't be what you wanted me to be. That's OK. Just time to leave this city. I've got a plan like the man in the sand. I'll change things. It'll be OK again. Atlantic City. I am the man in the sand. Don't look back. Time to get on track. Don't ask why. Keep looking at the sky. Just want to be free, break these chains off of me. Going to roll that dice. Don't have time to think twice. I am the man in the sand. Now I am a man with a plan. , asshole! light up before my eyes. What kind of game would that be? My dad used to play here. Frank Ryan? So you're Frank's boy. Haven't seen you since you were little. And Bishop's your uncle. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. You can't play. Why? Your uncle called. He said you'd want in. He told me to be discouraging. What's your name? My name is not relevant to this conversation. This other cop goes through my bags, and he gets out all my pills, and he lines them up on the counter like this. And he goes, hey, lady! These all your pills? I'm like, you took the bag off me. You know it's mine. And then he goes, you take all these fucking pills? I said, hell, yeah. When I get twitchy. MAN MAN Yeah? MAN He's here. MAN Really? MAN Yeah, it's not pretty. You might want to send someone to clean up. MAN All right. MAN By the way, who the fuck is Ursela? MAN Are you fucking kidding me? Uh-oh. Hey. You sick, Mr. Ryan? Do I look sick to you? Yeah. You got throw up on your leg. Yeah. That's gross. Mama's boyfriend looks like that sometimes too, only he ain't really her boyfriend no more. Why do you say that? Mama said he wasn't her boyfriend no more, and for me not to call him that. Huh. Yeah. And she said he could pack up, and he yelled. And then she said some bad words to him, and he left. Well, she was probably just mad, right? I mean, you know she didn't want you to hear those words. Oh, I didn't hear them. She got an all close and said something real quiet. But I saw his eyes get all big. He shut up right quick. So I know. That's... that's funny. Bad words aren't funny, Mr. Ryan. You're right. Bad words are not funny. OK. Bye, Mr. Ryan. Bye, Ava. Stupid dog! Ugh! Help! Zorro! Shit! Here. Calm down. You OK? Zorro. Zorro. Good boy. Good boy. Calm down. Calm down. Good, good, good. Sorry for the scare, shorty. There you go. You're Stryker Jones! Come on. Whatever. Come on. Let's go. That was Stryker Jones! Look at Karma Lion, going all hero and shit. Come on, Zorro. Whatever you say. Ah! Mr. Jones. Call me Stryker. How'd you know I live here? Did you think you Batman? Walk off and nobody see where you go? No. Little something. This for me? How'd you know I drink Irish? Didn't. Don't like it, don't drink it. Thanks. Hey, oh, let me, uh, ask you a question. What were you thinking today when you snatch up the little girl and the ugly ass dog? You had no stick, you had no gun, nowhere to run. I guess I just thought it was better for the dog to bite me than her. Hmm. OK. I mean, he wouldn't have bit her. The dog, yeah, but not her. Well, that mama says she loves that dog, so... All right. Hey, have a good night. Thanks for that. There's a in an old hotel, and a waitress and a bartender and no one else. Connor Ryan. You're not supposed to be here. Oh. Sorry. No, no, no. I'm baking you a cake. I was going to surprise you. Why do I get a cake? Because I heard what you did for Ava. Hey, how's your, um... Oh, it's... it's fine. It's just a nip. What are you making? I really don't know yet. I'm just being creative. I've got to go pee. Thanks for my charm, by the way. This guy is really peaceful. Mama says they know what matters. Says, makes it happy where they are. Says you give that to somebody when they need to remember that. Now. That's some good cake. And the milk? Mm-hmm. What's all this now? We're just eating some cake. Uh-huh. Y'all ain't mind if I join? Not at all. Feels all heavy in here. So what are we talking about? Uh, we were just, uh, talking about what Alice is working on. What was that again? What's this? Um, Revel. Dealing. Put an application in. Man, that place ain't going to do shit. They put all that goddamn money in the boardwalk, and it's going to be closed in five years. See if it ain't. Well, when it opens, I need a job. You hear from them? I'm working on it. Man, me and that motherfucker up there going to have words. He keep that shit going all night. Yeah you've probably got to get your sleep for work, right? What's the matter with your hiney, honey? Nothing. Were you just listening to me, or not? Sure, sweetie. But you know what I know. They do a magic show with animals. Real animals, I thought, but... Do me a favor, Gil. Dig up some dirt on these guys, please. Dig up, honey? I can Google them. I need more information on this Hoffman chick. Look, if I don't have any leverage, I'm not going to get paid. You could ask your uncle. I'm not borrowing money from him. No, about the Russians and Erika. OK, you don't understand. These guys are into some serious criminal shit, all right? They've got crates of... fuck it. What's he going to know? Well, he knows Atlantic City. He's worked for everybody from Mayor Langford to Skinny D'Amato. Skinny D'Amato? Oh, just forget it, honey. What do I know? I said this was going to be a flaky deal, and it's turned out to be a flaky deal. But why listen to me? Maybe it's time to raise the white flag and sell. Not a chance. So what? This piece of shit's a job? Some interested people want to know if it's too far gone to turn in into their condos or something useful. All right, well, listen, Bish. As much as I like watching you tap the wood over there, I'm, like, this close to losing it, so please tell me you have good news. No. Not even fucking close, kid. The best I got is the Hoffman girl is crazy. Downhill from there. A certifiable fucking nut job, that one. And I think she's hooked up with one of the Russians. The small one, I think. Yeah, Ramos. Chechen. This guy has sex in a bear suit. With other animal people. Yeah, well, anyway, you can't mess with these whatevers. They clean money for some important people who do not like any attention. That little Russian... Ramos. Yeah, whatever. He's what they call a layer. Like in a cake, you know? He filters money down through the Hoffman girl, their show, to her daddy's bank. And then they move it to rigged internet gambling sites to wash it, move it. That show's fucking stupid. Yeah. Phony ticket sales. Means lots and lots of cash, which they then lose online to the real owners, or pay it out to dummy accounts. What, I... I got a bunch of Russian mobsters throwing crates of cash in my Beachgate fucking apartment? No. Not unless they're stupid enough to shit where they eat. Look. The people they're doing this job for are from Philly, and they are connected. You cannot shed any light on them or their place. All right. Fine. If these guys have so much fucking money, why can't they pay me my fucking rent? Because it's not their money! Listen, how... how do you know all this anyway? You're... you're not connected, are you? Are you fucking kidding me? I'm Irish. The Irish do not get connected. No, I got a friend at the paper. He's a reporter. He's old school. He knows a bunch of stuff. Well, what about Skinny D'Amato? What about him? I don't know. Jill said you knew him. Yeah, a little bit. I know him a little bit. Your dad introduced me to him. You know that. No, I fucking didn't know that. Yeah, I mean, you know, he did, like, handyman jobs, odd jobs. Things like that. liked him. I mean, Skinny, he liked everyone. But when he found out that you dad, he played gin... your dad was a fucking great gin player... Skinny took him on. And then he bought him some suits and let hang around the club. The 500 Club? Yeah. My father was in the 500 Club? Yeah, when he was 18, 19. That's where he met your mother. I know that your mom, she talked her father into bringing the whole family for her 16th birthday. I mean, it wasn't like Sinatra was there or Martin and that goofball Louis or something like that, but your dad was there that night, dressed to the nines, I am sure. So I think they both sort of thought maybe they were stepping up in the world. The next thing you know, they're dating three weeks. Then it's three months. So the story goes. Yeah, I was thinking about them the other day. I remember them dancing to this stupid song at Beachgate. I think that's the last time I remember them happy. I... I should have told you about a lot of this shit earlier, but... Look. I had you for four years. Boom, you're off to college. I don't know anything about kids. Nada. You did great. But I know about this other business. You've got to stay away from these Russians. You got to let this go. Hey, Alice. Hey. What the hell happened? Stryker had a party, and... Jerod went up there? Smart cookie, that guy is, huh? They kicked the shit out of him. How bad is it? He bruised and beat. Why didn't he just call the cops? He was unconscious and bleeding. No, I know that, but before he went up there... I did call. Two fat cops went up and partied with them for half an hour. Stryker probably sicced one of his skank hoes on them. How's Ava? She's fine. She's with a friend. And you? I'm going to go talk to him. Again. Thanks. Again. Sometimes we don't see the point in pain. Karma Lion. That's bullshit. You missed my party tonight. Yeah, I, uh... I heard I missed a lot, actually. Hey, man. I respect the fact that you're looking out for shorty and her moms, but that motherfucker was way out of line, coming in my shit, fronting and drunk. Say, bro, the way my boys are, you lucky all he got was a busted head. I wish you could understand how I don't have the space in my fucking head for this right now. Hey, man. You gotta go over that shit with what's his name. Jerod. Whatever. I'll call him the motherfucker that fell down the flight of stairs. Damn it! Have a drink with me. You scared? No, I'm not scared. Come on, man. Have a drink with me. I'm trying to have a drink with you. You play? Fuck golf. All right. Goddamn. Sorry ass attitude made me think you didn't know how to play. Well, it was, uh... it's part of the uniform. Translation? Ah. I used to play with my, uh, my almost father-in-law. Uh-oh. Lion's got a story. I need to hear one. Father-in-law mean there's a girl. Tell me about her. What's up with your shirt? I mean, the Knicks didn't win in '99. The Spurs did. Fuck the Spurs. Make my own world. Ah. And don't dodge the question. We're just two individuals out here, just living. Come on. Have... have some drinks with me. Tell me about the girl. She was too good for me. How so? Well, she came from money. Yeah, well, I met a bunch of vulture motherfuckers with money. I mean, that doesn't mean... No, no, no, no, no. I mean, she... she came from money, and I knew it. She was cool, you know? Confident. Easy. She, uh... she always said she was going to have some huge fashion career in New York. Well, did she do it? Fuck yes, she did it. She's the fucking editor of "Vogue" now. Everything came easy for her. I guess I wanted that. So you think the cool and the ease came from the money. You don't? Mm-hmm. I think it comes from knowing your power and being in your moment. I mean, I got money now, so I mean, you... you didn't know me before I had money, so... How'd you fuck it up? Who said I fucked it up? Come on. Pretty girl, rich. Are y'all together? No. How'd you fuck it up? I left her, actually, a couple times, if you want to know. All right. Don't tell me you're one of them. She got your balls in a jar, and then she got the dog whistle. Ding a ling a ling a ling! No. Ring the bell for you to come home. No. She came back to me, actually. Even gave me some money to start up my own stuff. Shit. I'll be damned. So... fine woman, rich, chasing after you and putting you up? Your ass need to beg to get back in that bed. Where's your second album? Say what? Your second album. Oh, yeah. I've been doing some research on you, you know? On the computer. First album, sold a shit ton of copies, right? Millions. On the cover of fucking magazines, and no second album? I mean, I think it'd be easy, you know? Just pop some fucking fools and slap some bitches asses or shit. You're Stryker fucking Jones, right? No, no, no, no, bro. It's not... it's not... not fucking like that. You know, I mean, it's not about the money. You know what? I'm fucking sick of the... You good. You good. OK. Touch, motherfucker. Fuck the Spurs. That was the theory, right? See my way, though, my way was so fucking hard and slow. And her? That money was just easy. Yeah, but you got your own thing, right? You got the condos. Yeah. Oh, you have no fucking idea about the condos. - I saw the notice on your door. - Yeah. Look here. It's AC, baby. Anything could happen. Something doesn't pan out, fucking dig in, and you hold on. I mean, you've got a little something cooking with your girlfriend downstairs. She's not my girlfriend, all right? Come on. Hey, hey, hey. You ain't tried to fuck her yet? No. Not one time? Not one time. What we got over here? Look like Tiger Woods and shit. Hey, hey, hey. Look here, youngsters. Why don't y'all keep it moving, man.

Yeah, I can't believe I got you. ERIKA I've been meaning to call. I'm so sorry about the rent mix up. That's OK. It's all right. You know what? I'm really sorry about the air conditioning too. Yeah, I know. I hear the boys made a bit of a mess too. You know what? I can forget about that right now. If you could just get me the rent and the deposit, I... I just really, really... ERIKA Why don't you come by the show tonight and we'll clear it up? You know what? I'm at the apartments right now. Maybe I could just stop by and grab it. ERIKA No! I... I'm not there now.

What do you mean, no? You didn't look. You're playing with your phone. I don't have anything. Next. Next? There's nobody fucking here. What are you talking about, next? You've been looking at your fucking phone the whole time, so I suggest... Sir, that kind of language is not... Not helpful, I know. People tell me that all the time, honestly. Look, I just need my ticket, all right? Erika Hoffman left me a ticket. You mean Ms. Dietz-Hoffman? Dietz-Hoffman. Erica Dietz-Hoffman, I don't fucking care. Just give me the ticket.

You listen to me. That crazy bitch is obviously off her fucking meds, and I don't give a fuck what you or the fucking Putins are doing. I just want my money. I want what's owed to me, $6,000, right fucking now. I suggest you put some thought into how you want this to end. I'm the fucking victim here. For the sake of argument, let's say that you are. The relevant question is, does anybody but you care about victim and perpetrator, right and wrong? Does the bank care? Will the legal systems act quickly to redress your needs? My client's happiness is your only salvation. Look. You're a nice enough fellow, so I'll be as plain as I can. My client will be in town for another week or so. These fuckers signed a six-month lease. Circumstances have arisen. All obligations will be met when their business is concluded. Now just don't do anything rash, and we won't have to meet again. Hey, holds the leash? You or the girl? in the country so on a street by the river where the rent, it was cheap. always a roof under which you can sleep. when you go, you're all alone. ALICE Hey, Connor. It's Alice. I know it's late, I just... I found something. Jerod brought it home for Stryker and his gang the next time he has a party. This is crazy. Drinking every day, talking shit. Shit, I thought I solved all the problems with the noise machine. Yeah. Too bad didn't have those shamanic flutes. Look at me. If you get into trouble, you call the cops, and then you call me next. We'll figure this out. But hey. If he cracks my hand open, you've got to sit in the ER and hold my hand like you did his sorry ass. I can do that. I'm going to take this gun. Just tell him, I, uh... Fuck it. Tell him I took it. Thanks, Connor. I'm saying that a lot lately. Oh, shit. We taking the train, bitch. Because that cab ride is a .. That cab ride is a. That cab ride is a. We taking the train, bitch.

You got money to pay me my fucking rent. Ferdinand. With Ferdinand, anger bad. Oh, you know what else is bad? Bunch of spoiled shit in your fridge. Ah, you're a funny man. I am not. Don't sell yourself short, dude. You're fucking hilarious in that bear suit. And don't fucking threaten me, you piece of shit. You know what? I can't go to the cops. Fine. But I do know that I've told a bunch of fucking people about all the fucked up shit you're doing, right? Something happens to me, they come for you. So piss up a rope. Jesus Christ, Jerod. It's 2 o'clock in the fucking morning. Go pass out like a real drunk. You stole my fucking gun. All right, buddy. Turn me in. Get your fucking hands off me! Ah!

I know y'all got something going on. I ain't fucking stupid. I'll nip that off real quick. A pop in the mouth for you and her. You fucking son of a bitch! You listen to me. You hear me? You lay a hand on her, and I'm going to get un-fucking-civilized on your ass. You drunken leach! I'm going to get my gun! Go knock on 128. Tell him I sent you. Ask for Ferdinand, and remind him he's Russian. He likes that. Oh, Connor. Did Jerod do this? Well, it was either him or my crazy Russian buddy. You mean the bald guy with the loud dogs? It's not a dog. Not quite sure what the upcharge would be on that one. I can... I can give you a ride if you want. Nah, I got this. Go on. Have a good shift. Yeah. I got this. I'm all over this place. Don't worry about me. You must have some sort of admirer. We put the tires on, we took it out for a spin, fixed the windshield, she quit. Now don't be pissed off, but somebody put sugar in your gas tank too. Oh, that's sweet. JOSEPH Car trouble, Mr. Ryan? Listen, I'm thinking about how I want this to end. JOSEPH I'm listening. You want your clients happy, while I want the roughly $18,000 that's owed to me for the term of my lease. So if I'm patient, I get my bank to work with me, you going to guarantee me that I get my money at the end of this? JOSEPH I can guarantee you that if it goes any other way, you won't see a dime. All right. You let me know if I'm too noisy for you next time. Yeah, OK. What good is blame, my love? What good is shame, my love? It only brings pain, my love. I'm far away from you. I need the space. You too. ALICE Hey, you've reached Alice. Leave a message after the beep. You can come in. Hey, man. What's up, dude? What, you surprised I can read? It's just your glasses. I've never seen them. Well, women love these. Speaking of, I met your tenant last night. So I saw. She's confident, fine. Nice little... nice little frame. I give her an eight. Jazz it up a little bit, add a little sugar and spice. Eight and a half. Yeah? What's wrong, Lion? Why you look constipated? You said she ain't your girl. She's not my girl. OK. So if she's my pussy wipe, you wouldn't have a problem with that. Your what? You know, when you need a strong little piece to make you feel like top dog again. Wipe away all the negative bullshit with flow. You know what, man? I'm going to go. Oh, come on, now. Karma Lion. Karma Lion. Fuck you, man! All right? Fuck you. Come on, man. I'm just fucking with you, man. Come on. I wouldn't mess with you girl. Look. The way you feel right now, thinking I've been in that, if that don't convince you, I don't know what will. Karma Lion. Starting to sink in? Did she tell you what these mean? Yeah. Yeah. Shit, she got me revisiting something I read once before. This? Mm-hmm. Maslow's hierarchy of need? Yeah. I mean, old Maslow gives it a nice little try, but you know, he bugs me. He only studies Einstein and Henry David Thoreau, people like that. And, uh, what does it say right there? The healthiest 1% of the college population. Come on, man. And he didn't study no normal people, people I grew up with, people from the bottom. That's just a sample. There's exceptions. People are fucked up. But for the most part, people are people. You know, I'd be cool with that, if he was just taking a sample, but that's not what he's doing. He is taking the 1%, and he's saying that they're the ones who can understand need. But why are they healthy? Exactly. That's what I'm saying. Just because, what? The famous, got money, and went to college? Who's to say that they know anything more about loss, love, or life than anybody else? Shit, my moms was poor as a motherfucker, but she was in her bliss watching me eat pancakes she'd made. Now she knew more about need than some motherfucker who got everything. He ain't real. You know what I'm saying? I mean, come on. Uh, physiological needs must be met and security of resources and self-actualization. Come on, man. I need to fuck and get high and make music. You know what I'm saying? Those things make me forget I'm going to die. That's the shit that make me keep motherfucking living. Sex, mm. Music. Love. Those aren't just words. Them shits breathe. They got life. It's not some fucking pie in the sky. You think the fucking average Joe is sitting around, thinking about spontaneity and self-actualization? You know? But I bet you he knows when his dick get hard when a fine ass woman walk by him, huh? And... and forget about if he had stress a minute ago. That's over with. And he knows how he feels when he's with a girl you loves, now doesn't he? Because that's real. Joe not putting that shit in no hierarchy. Joe just living, man. Trying to figure out who he is and where he really wants to spend his days. That's a need. Maslow, man he cloud the shit up. Take all the life out of living. So what? Is all this shit going to be on your next album? Shit, it could. I could spin some shit on that right now. I want it. Let's go. Right now. Come on, man. I'm a bad boy now. Watch out. Hey, reminds me. I'm out next week. What do mean, out? Like, gone? Yeah, I'm out. Shoo! Gone. I've got all the words now, man. All I need to do is lay the tracks to the album. Like I said, this one here, it's got to be righteous. So throwing myself a little rap party. Here? Yeah, before I go to LA. Um, Saturday night. Shit, you always said I made too much ruckus, and I need a little ruckus to write, you know? So I figure I won't be so selfish, and I'll throw a party in honor of everybody who tolerated me. A little food, little drink. You know, music. All right? I even invited your circus folk to come, man. Fuck. I think they're, uh, magicians, actually. Yeah, whatever. Whatever What... I don't give a shit. They got a fucking tiger, man. And I want it. Mm-hmm. You know what, man? These guys, they're into some serious, fucked up shit. Fuck them. I want my party, Saturday night. And I want my tiger. Lions and tigers. And bears. Oh, my. Not unless they're stupid enough to shit where they eat. Take off clothes, now. What's up with you and the fucking clothes, fucko? Naked man cannot sneak away so easy. Mm. Our money, now. Not a fucking chance! Fuck you! This is a very simple tool. Yet, you know how much pain I could cause with such a simple, tiny thing as this? I'm Irish. You have no idea how stubborn I can be, motherfucker. Hmm. In my experience, stubborn burns away very easy. But as you say, you are Irish, and I do not know how stubborn you could be. But we will find out, yes? How to begin? Your fingers? Your nose? Your penis then. Fuck you! You can say whatever the fuck you want, but you're not getting you fucking money until your deal is done here and you're off my fucking property. I know you don't have a fucking choice, because the money's not yours. Yeah. Yeah, motherfucker. Oh, yeah. That made you stop, didn't it, motherfucker? I know more about you and your fucking money than you think. You know nothing. Then why'd you stop walking, fucko? Stop! We can't complete our business without that money. Oh, I know that. I know that. And I know the fucking people who you work for. They keep a really tight fucking account, so now it's all y'all's fucking chance now to make me really fucking happy. Monday morning. Ramos will get his money returned to him Monday morning, and then we part ways. If anything happens to me or that girl, I can promise you I got people here and in Phila-fucking-delphia that are going to be pissed the fuck off. If we do what you say, you will guarantee us we will get all our money. If you don't, I guarantee you ain't going to see shit. I'm getting into the fucking insurance business. Scare this kid. Do you fully understand what will happen to you if anything goes wrong? And what I will do to your friend over and over? You know what? I thought you were a criminal. But you're a straight up fucking villain, aren't you? Fuck you, shorty. Ferdinand, come. Karma Lion. What's up, Ramos? The Russian. I'm not Russian. I said this before. OK, whatever. Hey, look. Where's my fucking tiger? My brother will bring her soon. You sure about that? Uh, perhaps now we, uh, can take care of business. You take care of business where business is taken care of. Then you pay your rent. Fuck him. Thanks for that. You see her? Who? Who you think? Yeah, I mean, I... I saw you guys talking. I set you up, motherfucker. What do you mean, you set me up? Hey, what do you really need? Fuck the Spurs. Huh? My Knicks always win. That's right. Lion. I ain't seen you all week. If I tried to explain to you how shitty this week has been, you would never believe me. Oh, yeah? I might. You think? You look, uh... wow. Thank you. Karma Lion. You know that's what Stryker calls you. Uh, yeah. I don't think either of you guys want the karma I got coming my way. Oh, well, you've been doing all right by me. I'm going to go get us some real drinks. OK. This stuff is terrible. Yeah, it is. I'll be here. Ride through the city, my city got .. My city like the video game. with my city, my city .. Sipping my city. I ride through the city. My city send me no pain. like the video game. my city. My city. Sipping my city. All we needed was love. Feed me all of your pain and all of your drugs. Fuck, dude! Shit! He does not deserve Jezebel. The black motherfucker! You fucking weird ass racist. What the fuck is wrong with you? Look, now... look. Nobody here wants any trouble, OK? Why don't you just let me go back to the party? I give him exactly what he deserve. your tiger! Get the fuck out of my face. You got a dude dressed up in makeup in a motherfucking cage. I want a fucking tiger. Where's the fucking tiger? That's not Jezebel. That's the broke motherfucker that lives down the street. touch me, motherfucker! Ah! Your uncle says to call him. May want to put some clothes on first. He's not dead yet. They're going to want to talk to him. Come on. Mother fuck. I thought we were different. It was just a figment of my imagination, ation, yeah. Shit. What's up, man? I throw a hell of a party, huh? Yeah. It's not St. Paddy's Day at the Irish pub, but it wasn't boring. You know, Batman only wears a costume when he's jumping off of balconies and shit. Yeah, well, you don't got what I got. You know I'm going to name my album after you. Karma Lion. Where's my gun now, shit biscuit? Never got that drink. I'll make it up to you. And so my friends would surely like to locate that excess paper. Of course, they figure it's not all going to be there. I mean, feeding that tiger must have been fucking expensive. $20 grand. Shit, $50,000. That's a big fucking animal. Yeah, any more than $50 grand would be a real fucking greedy animal. OK, why don't we have supper tonight? I'll get a table at Vola's, all right? All right. Sounds good. What do you think? She's a big girl. Think she's going to make it? Hey it's AC. Anything can happen in Atlantic City. Well, I'm almost home, and I know all the roads. And they look the same as they did when I was young. It was years ago I was half baked, bright eyed, but all hope. And the things I didn't know. And I'm still all hope, but now I'm almost home. Too many sad days, too many Tuesday mornings. I thought of you today. I wished it was yesterday morning. I thought of you today, and I dreamt you were dressed in mourning. But I knew that you, with your heart beating and your eyes shining, would be dreaming of me lying with you on Tuesday morning. I fell through the window, and I found that I was still breathing. I thought of tomorrow, and the fear that you might leave me. I thought of tomorrow, and I wished it was Monday evening. But I knew that you, with your heart beating and your eyes shining, would be dreaming of me lying with you on a Tuesday morning. Turn your face from me. I will cover myself with sorrow. Bring hell down upon me. I will surrender my heart to sorrow. Bring hell down upon me, and I will say goodbye tomorrow. Because I know that you, with your heart beating and your eyes shining, will be dreaming of me lying with you on a Tuesday morning. And I know that you, with your heart beating and your eyes shining, will be dreaming of me lying with you on a Tuesday morning.
