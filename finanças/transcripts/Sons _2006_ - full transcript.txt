Careful! Thats what it is, check it out. There's no movement now, it's silent and resting. Hell! - What happened here? - What do you believe? Did you take a bath with your clothes on or what? You should better change, Lars.. Thought I'd find you here. You know, if Anja finds out, she'll kill you. - Yes, yes, but the child isn't born yet. - You're nervous about it, aren't you? Yes. J?rgen, I think you'll be a good dad. You would be a good one as well. - You sure it's today? - Yes. You sure this will work out? - Come on! - Almost finished! Here it is. - It's certainly hot in here. - Shhh! Turn off the light. That's Lene here. She sure has big tits. Now let me see. Do you... do you see anything? Mirror! Give me the mirror, fast! Does it work, can you see something? Not much, now let me try. Fuck! What a babe! Let me see! O my god! Shit, shit, shit! Oh no, fuck! Hell. The bar, the bar! I think there's someone in there. I cant open the door. - Come on, lets go. - No, no! - What about staying in here and sit it out? - We are stuck in here. - They are even older than my mum! - This one is my neighbour. - Whatever, open the door. - No way, no way! Two. Three! Hey, you! Out of my way! Let me go! So whats your name? Tim. So this whole mess was your idea? No. And what about your comrades, Tim? Left you back alone to deal with this shit? Did you try this mirror? Well, when I was your age, we tried the same trick. Glanced at the mirror a few times. So did you see anything? - Something interesting maybe? - A little bit. But we dont hit older ladies, Tim. Thats when troubles start. But mister, they started it. Nobody will believe you they started it. Not the lady at the entrance. I struck down a lady myself once, when she tried to stop me after we stole something. And when the cops arrived, I honestly said I was sorry to her... and I had to pay damages, otherwise my mother would have been involved. So you have to do the same thing here, otherwise you will be banned from this place. We are so sorry this happened to you, there will be consequences for sure. - How could he do this to me? - This shouldn't happen at all, we have guards... Here is the boy, he has something to say to you. - I'm sorry. - What did you say? I'm really sorry. You can say sorry to your mother, when we tell her about this. - Look at her lips! - And what's your name? - So whats your name? - No, damned... - Shouldn't you try to stop him? - What the fuck is wrong with you? Assholes. - Lars, what are you waiting for? - He just apologized and said he was sorry! - Ball for Lversen. Pass it to Flo! - No! Big chance for V?lerenga. There it goes. These are the Bortimot 20 Players going for the 16 meter. But whats that, it is over. Of course its quite hot in here. This is the seasons best match: Winner is V?lerenga, the first time since 1984. Hi. Shut up! Gimme that wallet. Forgot to pay up, he?! Lowlife! Hi. - Did you have a good time? - Yeah I guess. And what about you? - Whatever, he has to pay you for your services. - I was lucky you were at home. Lars? - Want a beer? - I was watching the game. And here comes Valerenga. With Magne Hoseth. Yes, Iversen! Steers to Steffen Lversen, but gets blocked by Espen Johnsen. Now the suspense kicks in, the game is almost over now. - M?kkalag. - A Top Player. ...had a bad start after halftime, but gets better by the minute. There's a lot of pressure on Ballf?rer. No? He wont make it. He needs more time to practice. So how do you know about these things? Well, men are going crazy over soccer, the talk about it all the time. - Not all men are like this, Norunn. - Yes they are, its a fact. ...this is the decision everybody is waiting today. No! No! Fuck! The final decision in this season! And it was this game! Who would have guessed? He sure has a lot of time now. - Rosenborg... - Norunn. it doesnt matter. - Rosenborg... - You, let it go. No. Norunn, I believe it. - Trondheims soccer games... - They are no fun anymore. You! Time is up for the ones with yellow ribbons. Okay, come on. Up! - Lars, non of my business... - This is the one. According to you, almost everyone is, Lars. - This time, I know it. - How do you know? He was here 10-15 years ago, and then he went away. - And who says that? - It is something everyone knows. So everyone knows? J?rgen obviously knows nothing. Yes. he has no opinion about anything. He thinks that everything ist just fine and good... Watch this! - Was there something more you would show me? - We did not catch him this time. Let it go, Lars. J?rgen! Didn'drive Hans boys around when we were young? Hung out in front of the school ans stuff like that. Yes, you did spread some rumours about it, but I know nothing about it. It says that you are at the back of the hall in uniform and during working hours smoking pot. But I wont fire you before i have proof, got it? I think that maybe... we will deny him admission here next time. Babyswimming is in about a quarter. Get ready. Thank you. Go away. Who are you?! Who the hell are you? Let go! Get away from my car! Stop! What were you doing with that camera? So why did you film this? It has nothing to do with you. It's him I am after. - Ok, so can I get the tape then? - No. No, I need it. Need it for what? At least do not show it to anyone. - Tim, I will show it to my boss. - No! Its so she realizes that Hans cant come to us anymore, all right? No, thats not ok, it's shit. I can give you money. Here. So how much does he pay? 100? 200 krones? - do you think it's worth it? - Just give me the tape, please. You dont realize what you are doing, Tim. - Cant you just give me the tape? - Tim, no one will know anything, ok? But they will see what I did! Please! You had many chances, not because I thought you are a good pool attendant- - but because J?rgen and me want to help you. - If you had seen what I've seen... - You're not gonna get away from babyswimming again. I'm so fucking tired of being lenient with you, got it? Whats going on here? - I did it only because of her. - Yes, and what? - I've got proof here. - Ok. Let me see it then. - The camera is broken. - It's broken? Did you destroy the office camera? I have one at home. It's much better than yours. You can have it. - Whats this on your arm? - It's blood. Mitt, I had to do something, I could not just stand there... You cant follow a customer in uniform and beat him up! I did not beat up anyone! Although he would deserve that. J?rgen, you know who the guy is. He should not be in here anymore. No, he definately should not be here anymore. It's decided. Decided? Is that all? There are procedures, but you wont think about them before you take your shortcuts. You must start to think before you do anything. Grow up, Lars! - If you see the film, then... - I'm not interested in your film! Go to the police, do whatever you want. And keep J?rgen, me and this place out of it. So you think it's ok these people are still welcomed in here? Get out. I am sick of you. Give me your uniform and never come here again! Out! J?rgen! Hi, this is Eriksen from the police. It's regarding Tim. Hey you, it looks like this bullfighting. What? What, you are sorry? You did a good thing, Lars, he fully deserves it. Yes. But what now? He cant get to this pool again, but that wont stop him. There are hundreds of game halls, swimming pools and young boys. - He just goes on. - But you have the film. I cant go to the police with it, you know what happens to Tim then? - Tim? He is the boy, isn't he? - Yes. Well it's certainly no ballet he did with the guy here...? What you did was good... the thing with the film. Yes. You could have given me support there. Yes, but Anja is my girlfriend, Lars. Yeah, and your boss as well. - So what are you going to do now? - I dont know. - Shouldn't you go to the police with it? - Maybe. He would be executed in prison, I guess. Ronny told me that Ken once said so. Anyways, at least what I heard was this: Hans takes pictures of... the boys that he has at home, when they are alone. So when you report him, and the police finds the tape... there will be trouble for both parents and kids. It's like evidence, even if you can get him in trouble, it could come back even worse for you. - And he is quite smart. - But we have the film now. Are you going to talk with him, or what? - Put a bit of pressure on him maybe? - Yes. Yes, that would be cool, but... I know that I cant do it. Why cant you think for yourself? This is not about Anja. - Yes, clearly it is. - So what about it now, J?rgen? - Even you say we should do something. - And what if we do it? It helps a lot of kids if he gets frightened and stop. So you do not care anymore? - Yes. I dont like that. I care about Anja not leaving me. I care about the baby and about the car. and about the rent, and even the fucking baby-ultrasound. I care about trying to be a little bit positive here. To be honest... I look a little bit forward! Do you think I dont want a day off? Just hang with you and not think of any consequences for one day? I started to use a helmet when I cycle, Lars. Do you understand? So what you are saying is that you would do something if you were me? - You know who this is? - Yeah, maybe. - I should get some money from you. 10000. - Now thats a little bit fast. Otherwise everyone you know will soon know what you are doing. - I dont know what you think you saw, but... - I know where you live. - So this is no joke? - No! - It's him who was talking to me right now? - Yes! You see how serious this is for both of us? In case he wont get 10000 till tomorrow morning, he'll send the tape to the police. They'll speak with your mother, and then they'll come for you. No one will understand that we two are together. Should I drop you off somewhere? You cant stay at my place now, we cant see each other for a long time. - You do have the money, right? - Not 10000 Krones till tomorrow. - Damn, I must have that tape tomorrow. - I will take care of this. Just tell me where to drive you. It's ok. I can walk from here. - Take care. - Stay in the car, Tim. Close the back door and buckle up. - When was the last time you ate something? - I dont know. You only eat junk food anyways. I'm just thirsty. No cola until you have eaten something. I mean it. - Is it hot? - Yes, but good. I think you had a bad dream. - Can I sleep with you tonight? - Yeah, sure. - So here you are. - Yes. You can get 5000 now, and a little later you'll get the rest, ok? Hi. Just wait here, ok. Come in. So, did you start all over again? Or did you do it the whole time? When was it you started to think that what I do is so terribly wrong, Lars? Hm? Is it because you read it in the newspaper? - Or do you visit a psychologist, maybe? - Shut up! You know exactly what the fuck you are doing. Yes, I know what I am doing, but why is it wrong? So the Germans, where the age of consent is 14, are wrong then? And you? You like them even younger. So in Spain, where the age of consent is 12, it would be fine? No, its shit. Do you think that is what this is about? For me it is, its what this is all about. Because here the age is 16, just because of a legal trifle... I did not have my own apartment for 10 years. I am free game, am i? I know why you take pictures of them. It's not just to look, isn't it? You should just take your money. They should not tell anybody about these pictures, am I right? Isn't that why you take pictures of them all? Here are 5000 Krones, and you'll get another 5000 soon. It's terrible for whom exactly? For the boys, or for other people? For some of the boys, I'm the closest they get so far. So far?! Damn, you are sick, aren't you? - Fathers dont do these things! - No. No. How do you know? As far as I remember, your dad wouldn't talk to you. - You... You! - I should have these pictures! - No, you have to go now. - No! No. Go now. You've got the money, now go. - Fuck! Give me the pictures. - No. Is ist in here where you have them? Go now. Go out of here and away. Give me your password. Give me your password, fuckin' Pedo! Give me the password! Oh! You. Come in here. Come in! Sit down. Give me the password. Give me the password! - P 13, 19, 14, 25. - Write it up. Write it up! You have reached Hans. Thanks for calling but I'm busy right now. but you can leave a message after the beep... You see what I mean. Bye then. Why are you doing this? Dont you hate him? I hate that you've seen the pictures. This is not about who bullied you in grade school, Jokke. Joakim. - Will you do it, or wont you? - In this case it is up to me. No. I wont do it. Its nothing new a man and and a boy have sex. Should I tell my editor I found the tape in the streets? I dont care how you do it. Just make sure that nobody will identify the kid... and that everyone can recognise Hans. Without knowing who made the tape, or even why, it wont work. Just do something! He must be stopped. Now you can take revenge! Revenge? I dont want revenge. I had forgotten about the whole thing. He probably has thousands of pictures on his computer. And for me, it really wasn't a big thing anyways. He emailed pictures of you around the world. Jokke. Jokke! My name is Joakim. Lars? Come to me. Hi, this is Joakim speaking. You can get your tape back. I made a case out of it. It's on the news tonight at nine. - Hello? - Hi. Is Tim here? Hi. - Are you... Tim's sister? - I'm his mother. Thank you. Who are you? Lars. Is he at home? Come in. - Cant he just come out? - No, he isn't home right now. I wanna know what you want from him. You look a little to old to be his buddy. Yes, she was here, she hit Tim. A really terrible woman. You came here and want to know about my children. - You understand how provocative this is? - Yes. But... - I wondered how Tim is. - Everything is ok with Tim. He's angry now but he will get over it. You dont look to be someone who goes up to other people asking about how they feel. Not really. No, but when they mentioned Tim, it was really - - quite unfair, the whole thing. Because it wasnt his fault. It wasn't? I almost thought so. Maybe he wants to be a girl. Just take some chili nuts, if you want. Hi. - What the hell are you doing here? - We just had a little talk. Did you say something? Did he say anything? What the hell did you say? What? - Don't worry, Tim. - He's a liar! He's a fucking liar! - I haven't done shit. - Tim! Tim! Tim! Wait! Tim! Tim. - Dont you think she has her own thoughts? - I didn't say anything. You promised me, asshole! We only talked about the woman who hit you. I came to talk to you. - Is that the truth? - Yes. - Do you swear? - Yes, I swear. So, can I get the tape? Nobody will recognise you, he made a promise to me. You promised me no one will see it. And then you hand it over to TV? But they will edit it. It's the gossip you're worried of? They will cut out your face, so no one can recognise you. Understand? It's a good thing we did. You will remember it that way. We did something about it. - So it was you who beat up Hans? - Yes. - So you know him, or what? - Everyone knows who he is. But it was only him and you alone? Well, my buddies almost went with me. The things he does, its much worse than you think, Tim. It gets worse and worse the older you get. For some, its perhaps not that bad. But for others, it's a heavy blow. They cant look other people in the eye anymore. Muslims and Pakistanis especially. They get completely confused. - It's not gay, wether you believe it or not. -I don't think so. Look. This is for you. Take it. It's for the tape. But this shit is important, so don't tell anybody about us and what we do. - Well what did we do? - Lets just say we let Hans bleed a little. He deserved it. Hm? So what are you planning now? I feel that all this is pretty idiotic. But quite typical for you to do. Yeah... Did you get a new guy for my old job? No, actually... ...there has been much less to do at work, after you quit. Awaiting someone? Hi. Did you get new clothes, or what? Yes. - Hello. - Hi. - Who is he? - This is J?rgen. And this is Tim. - J?rgen is with us. - Hell, I'm not. - Here. - Thanks. - No, really, fuck you. - Quiet, it starts now. Unknown group taking revenge against pedophile. An assault was filmed before the man pressed for money. And more and more people leave the church for good. Other religions and organsisations face a growth. An anonymous group called Anti Pedo Action... - Anti Pedo Action? - Is it you who said that? I didn't say this shit. TV2 got admission to a group of them. Activists of the Anti Pedo Action work in pairs. They set the trap by offering sexual services for money. You have to look on the screen. While one works as bait, the other one captures whats happening. Then they blackmail the men for money. Watch this. Who the hell are you? Go away... Hot shit, isn't it. TV2s source inside Anti Pedo Action said they intend to continue the attacks, and that so far none of the men reported them. - This was a big thing. - A big thing? And nobody will think it was you. So there will be no gossip. - What the hell is wrong with you? - Don't you understand? You can't do anything against him, without this kid. You only scare the shit out of people who pick up prostitutes, and earn money for it. - Don't you think Hans deserves this? - Of course. It's not what goes on. The kid should be in school and not on TV. I still think this one of the best things I have done so far. Okay, what will you do now? More of the same stuff? - Anti Porno Action. - Pedo. Anti Pedo Action. - Just listen to yourself, Lars! - There is not any group. Joakim can find out something. He is a journalist. He also was with Hans, when he was younger. We have taken Hans down, and the rest of them is pissing their pants right now. And what about the pictures? If the cops find Hans, they find the pictures as well. - No, the won't. - They won't? - No, because I have the pictures now. - Have you seen Hans' pictures? No, I don't bother to look at them, but I have Hans' computer. - So you have the pictures? - Yes, in the computer. At least I am doing something. You are such a fuckin' coward, J?rgen! If you had any balls at all, you would support me! And you look like a dick-head with your helmet on! - What was his problem? - Just forget it. He is just a coward.. Always has been one. What, why are you stressed? You are the hero now. You were great. Yeah? - But I gotta go now. - You do? - Where are you going? - Some mates. It's some sort of party there. Hey Tim! Remember, only me, you and J?rgen know about this. - Yeah, and Hans. - Yes, and Hans. And the journalist, but nobody else. TV2 has found a group with a special mission. Activists of the Anti Pedo Action work in pairs. Hey, that is Tim! Thats shit, wow. ...then blackmailed the man for money. Hey Tim. Can I be a part of this Anti-Whatever too? - No, I dont think so. - Come on. But I might check it out. Torgeir! Get a beer for Tim. - So, did you see it? - No. No? I told you to watch it. You can't decide what I do, Lars. Yes. I'm not finished with you! What is it you want? You will be recognised. Somebody will get you. On the job, for exapmple. Or on the bus. I am a human being, not an animal. I am not some pig. Sure! Hi. You, wait - I have a great idea... - Tim? Are you drunk? - I cant find my cell phone. - Come on. Come on! Cant you stand up? Let me go! - Are you finished? - Mm. Lie down. Lie down, I said. And take off your sweater. There's plenty of puke on it. Take it off, come on. Up with your arms. There, great. Disgusting! - You like girls, right? - Yes. Yes, of course. Hi, it's Lars. Sorry to bother you. I need some help here. - Hi. - Hi. Who is this? This is Tim. Oh. - He was at a party. - And is drunk. - Cant you comfort him a little? - Why cant you? Maybe it's better for a girl... to do that? Ok. Hi, Tim. This is Norunn, Tim. A friend of mine. Hello, you little drunk. You have to think of something nice now, Tim. And sleep well. Thank you very much. I will leave now, ok. We all need some comforting. Do you plan on sleeping on the mattress? Yeah. If you dont want to join him, then I have a much better place. No, thanks... it... Or you dont. You dont have to. - Not like that. - No. - It's not something dangerous, you know. - Well... So this the place you work? It's nice what you do with Tim, by the way. He's just a boy. Yes. Wont you take the call? - How do you know it's a client? - Who else could it be? a girlfriend or something? - Do you think I'm disgusting? - No. No. Norunn... Relax, Lars, it's just me. But I don't want it, damn! You can see I dont want it! But... Lars. Lars! Tim. Hello, you need to wake up. I have to go Tim! - So where are we going? - Just wait and see. - No, come on, tell me. - It's a surprise. Great. Get out. I am not your father. This one is for the hall. And for the car too, it's parked outside. I said the car is outside. Hey, Lars. Lars! Have you seen this one yet? Here, there's even more. Hey, they are my newspapers, Lars! Are you Tim? - Who are you? - Joakim from the news. - Is Lars here? - No. - I got a lot of mail here. - Mail to whom? Fot the Anti Pedo Action. What the hell are you doing here?! What? - What's this here? - That's mail. Check this out. There is a boy, only fucking 12 years old. Every Wednesday night when his mother works, a neighbour watches after him. He forces the boy to do sick things. And now he wants us to help him. Yes I see. - So Joakim was here? - Yes. - It is tonight. - Was that why Joakim was here? It's somewhere in Asker. - Haven't you been in school today? - You must read these too, there are so much. And what are you doing here? Looking for a job? What the hell do you mean? Read this! He is only 12 years old! Should we just go to Asker, walk into a house, and bust an complete stranger? - Yeah. A little pushing. Film it. - Just think about it! There is no Anti Pedo Action. And we are neither. Didnt you read the papers? We are all over them! - Should we just let them continue? - We can call the cops. He is just a child, alone without his mother. He's asking us for help! Are you a coward now? I'm not a coward, Tim, But we cant play god here. - Tim, you cant, you are to small! - Let me go! I have seen the pictures. - What? What pictures? - Holy shit, you are just a fuckin' coward. You cant even admit it. It is you who's too small. So she wasn't worth your money? Or do you like it for free? What? No! Help... Lars. Lars! Stop it. Calm down! Let him go! Lars. You... oh my god, slow down! Calm down! Lars. Lars! Relax. Shit, I dont know where he is. Anything can happen there. - You are not his dad. - No, but he is all alone now, isn't he? - I forgot to take his wallet. - It's ok, dont you think? - Do you want a beer? - Is this your money? The money over there. It's a fuckin' lot of money. What are you talking about? Has he paid you? Has he paid you? - Do you think it's not enough? - Oh fuck. Is it a possibility? What do you know? They deserve it, every single one. All of them? What? So every guy I took the wallet from was innocent? Innocent?! Have you fooled me everytime? Did they pay for the sex? - I thought maybe you knew it. - Of course I didn't know! Holy shit, you just used me. To get back at all men, to get them for your revenge. And what are you doing with Tim then? What? - Who was that? - Relax. It was a signal, ok? This is how we work. Ok. It will be fine. Come on. This is Lars. I need one of the emails you gave to Tim. He didn't give them to you? He fiddled around with them. He is trying to fix the issue himself. I need the Adress from one of the emails. There were over 70 of them. This was from someone from Asker, and the boy was 12 Years old. Yes. I'll read it to you. Why isn't this your job then? You are the big and strong one. Tim is only 14! What do you think will happen? - Drive to Asker and let him off. - Do you only write articles? It's you who makes the news here. Not me. There is no group. It's just something you made up. Maybe, Lars. But it doesn't matter now. This is Anti Pedo Action and it's good. I need your police radio scanner. - What are you up to? - Do you still..? - I must borrow it. J?rgen, listen to me. Dont come here and ask me about that. You'll get nothing, understood? I won't cause trouble. I just need the radio. Hi. What do you want? Please. J?rgen! What are you doing? Where are you going with that radio? - Fuck you. - I can do it alone. No, because you are too damn stupdid! Drive on! What if he's not here. He is with the neighbour. Just relax. Wait. Be quiet. - Can you repeat the last one? - We sent the T-38 there. Over If it gets serious, it will take do it. Over. 01 to all units. We have an emergency call from Solli way 33. An old lady is drunk and threatening the neighbors. Received. Thanks a lot. I know it's difficult for you, with Anja, the kid and stuff. - By the way, it's a girl. - You know it for sure? That's big, really fucking big. - And I thought I was ready. - You are, you cant bail out now. Look at me, Lars. I'm back right where I was ten years ago. Ok, lets go. - Wait. - What is it now? Piss off. Fuck! - No! - Who is this? Hello! - Stay put! - What are you doing here? - Stay where you are! - Easy now. Easy now. What are you doing with that camera? Son of a bitch..! Come here! No! Stop it! Stop it! Why do you want me to stop? You asked me to come here! If you touch the boy again, - - I'll send the tape to everyone you know. - This is the police. - Help! Whom are you calling? Whom the hell are you calling? We have an emergency call from Elgesetervei 14. It's probably nothing, but we lost contact. There seems to be a fight going on in the background. 0105 on the way. 01-B-60, how far away are you from Elgesetervei? This is B-60, we are 2 minutes away. Go to the left her now. Nr 14, this yellow one. If the cops arrive before us, I'm out. Are there more of your kind? I'll break your arm! Answer me! Are there more? Run. Run out that way, run! Hurry up! There was a break-in. There was a man, and he didn't look like us. We know what you are doing every Wednesday. If you tell the police anything, so do we, understood? - Fuck, Fuck, this is shit. - Have you seen Tim? Where is he? You were supposed to get him. - He is here somewhere. Did they say anything? - I have not heard anything. Signs of burglary, but no suspect. Send an ambulance. Ambulance is on it's way. Over. Look behind us. There are probably people who have fled the scene. One or more persons. They are looking for Tim, not us. We would like to check a car. Registration DE-7376... got it? I can't be in jail when the baby is born. You know how fucked I am now? Calm down, J?rgen. And don't look in the mirror so much. - We have the scanner, we can fix this. - Car is reported stolen in the afternoon. - Fuck! I can not take the blame, Lars! - You know you can run them out. So we are fucked. Run! We can not give up now. J?rgen, please. Yes, the car stopped. We are waiting. Is there a roadblock set up? Over. We set one up at Jutul Way, southbound turn. I give you 20 seconds max. Find Jutul Way. 20 seconds ahead. Get your finger off, Lars. Are you ready? I have it. Run! They ran off! They are on the way to the roadblock, over. - Is it far away from here? - It's 600-700 m to the roadblock. - Exit right in front of us. - Up here? The one right here? - Here? - Here! Lars. Hello there. You have reached Tim's crappy telepho... J?rgen, take a taxi home, okay? - What the hell are you going to do then? - I have to find Tim. He can be anywhere. If they didn't get him, there is only one place he could have gone. Tim, you are so naive. You don't realize that Lars is just exploiting you. If you hang out with him, you'll end up like him and the others. Which others? Take off your sweater, you should get a new one. - But he helped me. - He helped you? Are you that stupid? It's him who is up shitcreek without a paddle. He only uses you for his revenge on people he doesn't like. Can't you see he is just using you? It only ends in one place, and that's prison. And you would not be the first. Hey? It's not you I'm angry with, you know? I am angry at him. He can't see you are only a little boy. See, now lets take this off. Aw. It will hurt a little bit. There. That's a brave boy right here. Hi there. I live at the fourth floor, and forgot the keys again. Wait, Lars. I have been with Hans a little more than what I actually told you. - I have been with him alone, too. - I know, J?rgen. - What do you mean? - I've seen the pictures. - He took pictures of all of them. - Yours too? J?rgen, everyone was there alone, and everyone thought they were the only one! I have seen the fucking pictures. There were certainly thousands of them. He put them on the web, and shared them with others. There are probably perverts in Greece or South America... and they have naughty pictures of us when we were 13. Understand? So when he calls you... Tim? When he calls you, - - then don't pick up the phone. After a while, it's over. Right? Hello? - Is Tim here? Where is Tim? - I... I don't know. You, this, this... You have gone too far. This is enough, now go, I say. Where is tim? - Answer, you..! - At the bathroom. The bathroom. Tim. I know that you are in there. Come out now. Tim, don't fuck around. Tim! Calm down. - Let me go! - Tim! Tim, calm down! You stay where you are. Sit down. Everything's ok. Everything's ok. Did you talk to the police? - I was asking, did you talk to the police? - No, okay? - Did you talk with someone else? - No. Good. Do you remember me, Hans? It's been a long time now, but... I was just a child then, you know. Look at me. I used to come here on weekends, when I was supposed to go to my father. Eventually he found out I went here instead, and he wasn't even bothered. So in the end I only stayed with mother. J?rgen. Is that you, J?rgen? You used to blow me. And took pictures of me afterwards. You came here voluntarily, J?rgen. No one forced you to come here. - I was 13 years old. I had not! - No. You had it good here. Don't try to say you didn't have it good here. You liked the sex, and... J?rgen! J?rgen! - Slow down. J?rgen! Calm down. - Damned fuck! Relax! Relax now. No! Tim. Don't help him. He is going to kill me and then you will end up in prison. - Stand still! - Tim. - I won't go to prison. - No, you won't go to prison. - This is not your fault, Tim. - Don't listen to him. He is lieing to you. - You Liar. - Yeah. You are 14 years old. You won't go to prison. Don't let him persuade you. Don't trust him. - He was in there. - Tim. Give me the gun. How many had you since then, Hans? 100? Careful! 200? 500? See, here is one of your sons. Do you remember him? Do you remember Eric and Petter? This was before J?rgen and me. And Karl-Einar. And Ahmed and... and Tim! Shut up, okay? And stay where you are! Have you posted all our pictures on the web? He has posted pictures of all of us on the web. Yours too. I haven't lied to anyone. You can be as angry as you want, but I never cheated on you Damn, and you liked it, didn't you. Can't we be a little honest now? So what are we then? Boys who like to play with fire. - No, Tim. - Shit! Shut up, okay? You must turn the safety off, Tim, otherwise it won't work. No, Tim. Come with us now, Tim. What if I go to the police with your computer? Well if you have to. Yes. You know what they do with people like me in prison, do you? Tim. Tim? Are we away? Yes. So is it over?
