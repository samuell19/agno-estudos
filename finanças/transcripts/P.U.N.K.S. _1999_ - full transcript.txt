That just sucks. -So much for student council. -Too bad, Drew. You ran a clean campaign. I guess you're not leadership material. -Like you are, Spangler. -Oooh, big talk, science fair runner-up. -Yeah, well, my dad is smarter than your dad. -So what happened to you? -Hey, chill. My dad's smarter than both your dads. VOICE OVER LOUDSPEAKER: This is a restricted test area. Crow employees with security status of G5 or lower must vacate the test area. Security team to BioLab, security team to BioLab. This is a red security live subject test rated highly dangerous. Authorized augmenter technicians only. T-minus 60 seconds and counting. -Mr. Crow, we can't test the augmenter on a human subject until I finish the other test. It's too soon! -Seize the day, Mr. Utley There is no time like the present. Proceed. -But they augmenter is designed to help paralyzed people to walk! I designed it specifically to regenerate atrophied muscles with electrochemical bio-static stimulation! But there could be serious side effects! I mean, he could become psychotic. He could go into cardiac arrest! -Relax, he's a convict and he signed a waiver. -To do community service! Not light up like a Christmas tree! -Nonsense. We have taken every precaution. Thank you for your concern. VOICE OVER LOUDSPEAKER: Pulse 50. -BP 140 over 85. The doctor said it would take ten weeks for me to be walking again. -Heh, ten minutes. -Set it at 400 MIU. -400! That's too high! I didn't authorize that! You didn't pay for it, either. Sit down. Hit it! -I can walk! I can walk! I can walk! I can walk! Hey, look! VOICE OVER LOUDSPEAKER: Code blue. Code blue Electrobiostatic generator is unstable. Repeat, generator is unstable. Code blue. Alert! Alert! -Pulse is 200 and rising. Blood pressure 220 over 140. VOICE OVER LOUDSPEAKER: Fire. -His vitals! They're off the charts! We-we've got to shut it down, please Mr. Crow! -Absolutely not! Keep going. VOICE OVER LOUDSPEAKER: Insulin surge! Override failure. System failure. -Should I tun it off? Should I shut it down? -Absolutely not. That barrier can stop a tank. Keep going. VOICE OVER LOUDSPEAKER: Danger! Please proceed to the nearest exit. Critical system overload. -Shut it down! Shut it down! -How's his pulse? -It's strong. -No kidding. [bell rings] What are -You eating? -A rickecake. It's high in complex carbohydrates. -Ew. -What's up, Joe? -Taking the bus? -Nah. Mom and dad are picking me up today.

But he's going to try and meet us at the pizza place. -Whatever. -Hi. Hi guys. Hi. -Hey, honey. Your friends are here. Why don't you give them some cake and save your dad a piece. -Why do you let him eat that fat, buttery, death food, mom? -It's angel food. -You know it's bad for dad's heart. -Oh, sweetheart, I've been with your father long enough to know that he's going to do whatever he wants to do, anyway. Hey, boys, this is you. -How was pizza? -Great. My dad was a no-show, as usual. Hey, I'll get back to you. I'll make it up to you, I promise. -Bummer. -Oh, here. Happy birthday. Apple cinnamon crisp. Nature's gift to you. -You shouldn't have. -Happy birthday. It's a computer pad. See? -Gee, thanks. -We just have to hold on for a couple-- -More weeks. I know this is a special project, but you've been saying that for a few months now. -Well, does it mean anything that I'm doing something that's going to help mankind? -Of course it does. But that is no consolation to a kid with a broken heart. -Did you tell him how sorry I am? -That's you job, mister. -Stupid jocks. I hate them. -You know, I bet we wouldn't get picked on so much if we band together like the X-Men. -Yeah. That way we'd get beat up as a group. -no, I'm serious. Ever notice how jocks like Ronnie always travel in packs? They're a team. -We'll never beat those guys. -Maybe we could. If we started a club or something. Strength in numbers. United we stand. That sort of thing. -What do we call it? -Guys who like to get beat up. -I was thinking more like, The Action Adventurers. -Ooh, A.A. That kind of has a ring to it. -Who would join? -No one likes us. -We'd be like the X-Men. Everybody has something they're good at. Miles, you'd be the science whiz. I'd be the idea man. And Lanny, well, Lanny's got to be good at something. -You know what, I have a better idea. Let's start a Wrestlemania club. Right now the Undertaker's having is way with Mr. Perfect. Get up poor boy. -Come here. Here comes [inaudible]. Drops him like a bad apple. -One, two-- MOM: What are you kids doing up there? -Uh, aerobics. Ow. MOM: OK, work those bodies. -[inaudible] -What's this? [inaudible] under the ring. -[inaudible] -Oh, yeah, yeah! -Happy birthday, 13-year-old son. I'm sorry I'm late. I'll make it up to you, though. I promise. -No big. -DId you, uh-- -Yeah. Sang it. Ate it. Opened it. -You didn't open this one. -What's this? -It's a fish tank. -Where are the fish? -Well, you can use it as a terrarium for other pets. It's your call. -Thanks. -Say, how would you and your friends like to come to work with me tomorrow? You can play on a supercomputer, and surf the net. huh? How does that sound? -Sorry, Mr. U. I can't. Tomorrow's Saturday. WWF Royal Rumble? Don't miss it! Yeah! -Is he on steroids? VOICE OVER LOUDSPEAKER: Project desigates [inaudible] report to research. -Go, go, you've almost got it. Dang, you lost. -You having fun? -Yeah, this is cool. -You boys are really good at this. -Apple? Crow wants you. -I-- I gotta go. -OK. Dude, what does your dad do here? -He's a biochemical engineer. He designs this robotic gizmo to stimulate muscles or something -These files read like a top secret defense project. I can't believe it. Everything's classified. What do you think APR means? -Advanced project research, maybe? -Couldn't tell you. -There's one way to find out. -Do it. -Enter. -Classified. -With all due respect, Mr. Crow, I designed the augmenter specifically for civilian rehabilitation, and the control motion unit as well. Heck, in the wrong hands, something on that scale could upset the whole balance of global power as we know it. -I will not even dignify that with a response. Why don't you just worry about what you can actually do. Like get the control motion unit online before the next demo. -It won't be ready, sir. Not even for a hardened convict. -You're absolutely right. It would be much more impressive to the investors if the inventor himself wore the augmenter. -I'm trying to tell you it's not safe. -Right. So make it safe, because you're wearing it. -What? -Well, let me put it this way. If you don't want your life's work going up in smoke, if you don't want to be taken off this project for good, you'll go to the mat for this project. Got it? -Yes, sir. -Good. Hey, you know what we're doing this weekend? We're going to take the corporate jet and we're going to go squirrel hunting . You want to come, Hutley? Huh? A gun like this almost shoots itself. -What's the sport in that? -It's the way I like it. Would you go back to work? My bird hates you cologne. -Yes, sir. I'm sorry. -Looks like I found something. An electrobiostatic stimulation augmenter. This is cool. -This classified augmenter thingy sounds dangerous. Crow wants to test it on my dad. -So? -So, my dad has a heart condition. I mean, maybe they're trying to get rid of him. You know, make it looks like an accident. We've got to find out more. -OK, let me try this. I can't. Not without Mr. Crow's super user password. -Drew? We have to leave. -You don't think Utley is going to cause us any trouble, do you? -No. No, he still thinks we're going to use the augmenter for medical purposes. The idea would never occur to him that we're going to sell it on the open black market to foreign regimes. -Poor sap thinks he's going to win the Nobel Prize. -Well, he might. Posthumously. You know that if this contract fails, I lose my entire company. I'm banking everything on this. So this is your job. I want you to keep those big, beautiful eyes on tall boy. And I want you to keep him on schedule. -Even if it kills him? -Especially if it kills him. The government sells to every Saddam, Dick, and Harry. Why can't I? -Hi, Dad. -Hi. -I thought we were going to go fishing today? -I'm sorry, son. I have to test something for Mr. crow this weekend. -No, no, no, let's go go-kart racing instead. -Drew, things will be totally different after this weekend, OK? -But you always say that, Dad. Why can't work wait? Come on, please? I mean, just a few days. -I'll make it up to you, OK. I promise. Where's your mother? -She's in the kitchen. -Brad. Oh, they're plastic. They're beautiful, you shouldn't have. -Honey, I have to work all weekend at the office again. We're testing the augmenter. -You know, you promised. I mean, fist it was his birthday, now this? -I know, Honey, I know, but I just can't blow it now that we're so close. I mean, there's too much at stake. Mr. Crow could pull me off the project and I'd lose everything. Besides, he already-- he already thinks I'm a big wiener. -Hey. Buck up, pilgrim. You know what they say? A wiener it's just a winner spelled wrong. -Hello? -Miles? We're on. -Ronnie. Ronnie! Ron, listen to me! I'll get you the money that I owe. Ronnie, big guy, I'm paying you 50% for protection as it is. OK, OK. I said I'll get it, and I will. Later. -Hey, Johnny. We're starting this club and it's for these guys-- -For what? Nerds of America? -No, no. We're embarking on a clandestine, highly sensitive, dangerous operation, and we need your expertise. -Gee, thanks. But spying doesn't pay well. And besides, I'm booked solid. -OK, tell you what. If you don't help us, I'm going to tell Ronnie and those jock friends of his that those autographed Seattle Mariners baseball cards you sold him are fakes. -Fakes? -OK. I'm going to kick your butt. You're gone. -Uh, you know what? My schedule just opened up. -Wow, cool garage. -Yeah, it's my dad's old home lab. Never comes out here anymore. -I'm in Radio Shack heaven. Electronics, amps, transmitters, receivers, robotics, surveillance equipment. Could I borrow a few parts? I'm going to come up with a science project to beat that Marty Spangler. -Lofty goal. -Oh! Aw! -What is this? -Hey, hey hey. I wouldn't-- -Oh! -Touch that. -I'll be down here. -Oh, uh, stun gun. He'll revive in a few minutes. Come on. CROW (VOICE): This is Crow, and this better be important. You've got 30 seconds. So do make it short. -I've recorded his voice into the computer. And I'm editing it. CROW (VOICE): So do make it short. Make it short. Do it. [inaudible] This is Crow. This is Crow. Crow. Crow. Crow. -Aw. [inaudible] Do you have any snacks? COMPUTER VOICE: Crow. Crow. This is Crow. -A radio [inaudible]. OK, I'm tapping into core research. Main menu. I'm into the directory. Changing Crow's number to here. And I'm out. -Twinkie lite. -Call this number right here. -[inaudible]. Carlson speaking. - Yeah, that better be you, Carlson. I got Crow calling me about a problem with the server. -Server problem? -Yes, now do you want it fixed, or are you just going to repeat everything I say? -Sorry. -Darn right, you're sorry. Now I'm going to need you to type in the super user password. We're going to get this thing straightened out pronto. -Not unless Mr. Crow tells me. -No kidding, genius. I'm the one who installed the system. Now, you got the dad-gum mouse in your hand? Be a good little boy and go to the directory. Select Edward Crow. CROW (VOICE): This is Crow. -This is Carlson in systems. Sir, we got a computer fix-it guy who wants a password. CROW (VOICE): You've got 30 seconds. -He says you called him. Should I give him the go-ahead? CROW (VOICE): Do it. -Okey doke, just wanted to clear it. CROW (VOICE): Do it. Do it. Do it. This is Crow. Make it short. [inaudible] Do it. Crow. -I beg your pardon, sir? CROW (VOICE): Do it. -All right-y, then. -We did it, Miles. -Way to go, Miles. -Hey, what are you cool cats scratching at in there? -We're stealing top-secret technology from corporate databases, mom. -OK, daddy-o. Don't break anything. -Well, you've got your disrupter, your neuralprocessor, and you megabyte deck, micro-surgical CPBs, adrenal boosters, and electrochemical amplifier. If I didn't know better, I'd swear it's that electrobistatic augmentation unit. -The what? -An augmenter. An enhancer. A booster for the nervous system. Pretty powerful. Judging by this gauge here, I'd say in 20 minutes, you could fry your whole nervous system. -So what would it do to someone with a heart condition? -Kill them in five. -Guys, my dad's in deep. -It's bad news if your dad straps this thing on. -But they can't make him wear it if we-- -Steal it? -Are you insane? We'll get so busted. -I really need your help here. Let's make it our first official mission. -Hello, security everywhere. How can we possibly break in? -No prob. I got this cousin. Sam. -OK, I'm about to charge us $1 a mile. Pay up, everybody. Come on, come on. Cough it up, there you go, good boy. -You know, wouldn't it be dope if we made up a name with our initials? -That'd be cool. -Well we've got a Pasiotopolis, an Utley, a Kitchen, a Nygren, P.U. K.N. -Pukin'? That doesn't sound very rad. -I like A.A. Personally, but what about K.N.U.P.? Silent K. -Oh, you're going to make my K silent? I don't think so. Let's make your N silent. -K.N.U.P.? -On that's strike fear into the hearts of our enemies. Watch out, guys, it's K.N.U.P.? -Hey, hey, wait. What about P.U.N.K.? -Yeah, P.U.N.K. -That sounds rad.

So what's shaking? -Oh, no, not this. -Guys, meet my cousin Samantha Swoboda. Sam, the guys. -These are them, huh? -Yep. -Who's the guy eating styrofoam? -That would be Lanny. -Um, it's a rice cake. High in complex carbohydrates. Um, less than a gram of far and six grams of fiber. I just thought yoou should know. You weren't even close. -And, uh, where'd you get this one? The weenie factory? -Excuse me. I have an I.Q. of 160. -Oh, really? Well I've got a calculator. -No way. She can not go with us on the mission. -Says who? -She's a girl. Drew, back me up on this. -Well, technically it's not in the bylaws. -Technically there are no bylaws. -Who cares what she is? I mean, Jonny says that she can help us. -Her name's Swoboda for crying out loud.

It's no wonder you're out like a sack of spuds. I mean, look at this. Where's your fiber? Where's your protein? My god. What is this? You can't even salvage this. And peanut butter.

Mr. Pena, can't rule him out as a suspect. -Are you two finished? -We've got some prints, here. -I want you to find out who was in here tonight with their security card. What did I just say to you? -Done. Done. -Things are starting to calm down. -Nice work. -Thanks. You know, you're not too bad yourself. -This is the bomb. We could sell this for a fortune. -Whoa, Jonny, this is classified intelligence. I mean, we should be camouflaging this. -Yo, wouldn't it be phat if we painted it like cherry red with flames? -It's an augmenter, not a Camaro. -So what's your idea, wastoid? -Hey, wait, wait, everybody. -Knock it off, you guys. -What are you're looking at? -I don't know. I thought it was a girl, but I'm open to suggestions. -Ooh, shot fired over the bow. Boom! Direct hit. -Quiet! Knock it off you guys. This isn't about being cool or making money. It's about saving my dad. And if you guys-- -Hey, dangerous. CROW (VOICE): Mr. Flutey? -Hey, it's Crow. CROW (VOICE): Unfortunately, Mr. Flutey, they took the augmenter and they erased most of the files, but hey, I always say, thank god for back ups, you know? -Back ups? -Shh. -No. Your buyers are covered because we have the prototype augmenter, that's why. Well, it runs a little hotter, it reds a little higher, but it will do just fine for the demonstration. Yes. We're still in business. Yeah, I'm right here. You know what, I can't wait to show you the CMU. The controlled motion unit. CROW (VOICE): Well, it's an add-on to the augmenter. -It allows you to control who's ever in the suit. Oh, it's wild, you're going to love it. Well, of course I'm confident, because the police have prints. I promise you Mr. Flutey, that in 90-- make that 48 hours, we will have the thieves. Goodbye Mr. Flutey. -Hey, at least none of us have police records, so none of our prints come up on file. -Well, uh, that's not entirely true. -Oh, don't tell me, you guys have records? -You know what? This whole operation is just really starting to suck. Beaucoup. Excuse my French. -He's right. If we go to the feds with nothing on Crow, we'll all go to jail for grand theft. -I was just talking about we're all out of granola rice cakes. -I say we give up Samantha and Jonny like ugly stepkids. It's their stinking prints mucking up the works. Oh. -Yeah, right. We are not going down our accomplices. We'll name names. -I told you she was trouble. She's evil. -No. No, we stick together. United we stand. To protect the underdog. -Not if the dog leaves fingerprints. -We hit Crow where he lives. We tell him if he doesn't turn over the prototype augmenter backpack, we'll go public with the one that we have. -Mr. Crow? It's gonna go down like this. We're gonna meet in a public place. Golf course. Seventh and Main. I'll be dressed as an Egyptian. Be there at 4 PM sharp. And bring the prototype, or the deal is off. Got it? Have a nice day. -All right, hubcaps. Be back in an hour. Stay out of trouble. -Always, Mom. [music playing] -Hey, Drew, Miles, Lanny. Nice. -Some disguises these are. [radio whistling] -Hole 9, please don't climb on those sphinx. Thank you. So, uh, what's with the outfits? -What's with yours? -I'm working. -So are we. Five putters, five balls. Straight up. -OK. -Good, King Putt. -So, uh, you seen any suspicious characters around? -Besides you? No. -That's what happens when you don't stay in school. -I heard that. Ugh. [radio whistling] -Hole 9, I mean it! Don't make me ban you from the course. -Nice outfit. You've got some nerve. -Well you, you get used to it, you know? [groans] -Where's the backpack? -You have a claim check? Oh, gee. [man gasping] -I don't-- ugh! -Uh-oh. Crow's goons are about to embalm King Putt. Let's go, guys. Plan A. [grunting] -Hey, you want some of that, huh? -You guys want some free tokens? Or something? -Start talking or you'll be swallowing the whole River Nile. DREW (ON PA SYSTEM): Hey, over here. -Leave the king alone. DREW (ON PA SYSTEM): You want the unit? -Come and get it. [spluttering] -Ah! -Come on! -Run, guys. -Let's get him. -Got him. -Ah! -Oh! Whoa! -Ugh. Gah! -Damn. -Get back here, you little twerps! [shouting] -Yeah! -Whoa! -Look at them roll! [laughter] -All right, guys. Let's go. Come on. -Let's go. [ball falling in hole] -Come on! Into the crypts. Let's go. Let's go. -Can I borrow these? Thank you so much! -Here, give me one. -Fore! -Ah! -Hey, nice slice. -Yeah, well it drifted a little to the left, but I'm happy with it. -Golf clap? -Golf clap. [soft clapping] -Oh. They didn't bring the Augmentor! [heavy breathing] -Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Move! -Let's go this way. Let's go the other way. Uh. -Uh. -Jump? -Jump! -Whoa! [laughter] -All right, man! Yeah! All right! -Hold it right there. JONNY: Uh. Miles, come on. Help us out. -Get your hands up. [electric static] [yelling] [grunts] -Come on. Crow's still got the prototype. -Which means he's still going to test it. -Hurry, Mom. Step on it. These goons are going to hop us because we're about to blow up in the whole operation. Go! Hurry! -Great. OK, 007s, I'm going. I think you kids can sit up now. The coast is clear. Oops! There's one! -Huh! [giggling] -Just kidding. -Oh. -What? -Mom! -What? I think you kids should cut back on the TV. [projector clicking] -Oh, great. We're back to Pasiotopolis again. Go through it again. Come on. Right now. Are you telling me that you don't recognize one of these kids from the golf course? Not one? -They were wearing sunglasses. What can I say. -(HIGH VOICE) They were wearing sunglasses! All right. What about the security card? -Sir, they crashed the entire system files. We're doing everything we can around the clock to rectify the situation. -It is somebody close to us. We're going to hear from them again. I can feel it. -Are you with me? -Yes. CROW: Are you with me? -I'm with you, sir. -You stay on top of your game. -Yes, sir. -You find them. -Crow won't come to us, we'll go to him. -We'll set up a surprise meeting. Get him alone. -So how do we do that? -My dad says Crow hangs out at Kramer's Bar after work. [music playing] [cases dropping] -We're the band. -What'll it be, gentlemen? -Chocolate milk, uh, on the rocks. -Ha. Well, this is all we have right here. -We'll have three 57 T-birds on the little plates. -Right. -So when's your birthday, big boy? -Uh, September 5, 19-- LADY: You're a Virgo. Virgos are very creative people. They have these really powerful auras. You have a very powerful aura. -Thanks. I have been working out. [coughing] -Excuse me will you? I-- I have to speak to someone. -You like baseball cards? -Yeah, sure. -Check these out. You're going to flip. -Edward Crow, you have something I want. -You little punk! -I wouldn't. It's a very public place. -August 2, '84. -In return for the Augmentor prototype, I will not release the countless required conversations, photographs, the memos, et cetera, et cetera, and I will not expose you for the criminal rat that you are. Fail to cooperate, we'll take you down. It's that simple. -Are you finished? I don't think you know who you're dealing with here because I would squash you like a little bug. I will squeeze your guts out until they become juice. -$50 huh? -Yep. It's a '79 autographed Lyman Bostock. Very rare. -Yeah. Rare. Except Lyman Bostock died in 1978. This little hustler is trying to con me in my own bar. Boys. -Uh, you know what? If you're a little light on the cash today, I could always-- -Uh-huh. -Come on, you. [electrical hum] -(WARBLING VOICE) Yeah! And you! [inaudible] It's a battle royale. -Ugh! -(WARBLING VOICE) Last man standing kisses the trophy girl! You Scottish Nozzola, how does that feel? I'm such an animal but with a sensitive side. You realize this is going to hurt, right? Good! [thunk] -(WARBLING VOICE) Oh, that had to hurt. Ugh! Stay there! -Hey, kid. Come here! -(WARBLING VOICE) Woo-hoo. [grunting] -Jeez. [grunting] -(WARBLING VOICE) How's that feel? Hey, I'm talking to you. How's that feel? Ah. Who's next? Listen up, cheese butt. Hey, listen to me. Failure to comply with our demand will result in the all time greatest, King Kong monster wedgie of the century. And it feels a little like this. [fabric ripping] -(WARBLING VOICE) Got that? -Oh yeah. -(WARBLING VOICE) Good. Get out of here. Mwah! Dig it! [static] -This is a fiber-optical video system. My dad's a surgeon. -This is a trans off of a '73 hardtail. It turns rotational energy or torque into electrical energy. -This, my friends, is a leaf blower. It blows leaves. Illegal in 40 states. -Crow's going to be out for blood. So we better make ours better than his. Miles, Samantha, do your stuff. -Done. -Sh! Crow's on the phone with that Flutie dude. [clicking] CROW (ON RADIO): This is nothing we can't handle. Well, we already have IDs on two of these petty criminals. Believe me, that will be my pleasure. -I will take care of them in such a way their mothers won't recognize them. CROW (ON RADIO): You just show up at the-- -Shareholder's meeting, OK? I will make it worth you while. CROW (ON RADIO): Bye-bye. -We better crash at your guys' places for a while in case they come after us. -Oh sure. Hi, Mom, Dad. This 14-year-old girl is just sleeping over tonight. Don't mind me. I'll be upstairs, in my room, entering puberty! Are you nuts? -You guys can crash in my basement. Just don't steal anything. -We won't. -So what's with this big shareholder's meeting? -I don't know. But my dad's been working on a remote for the Augmentor, night and day. In fact, this is the prototype. CROW: You just refuse to put yourself on the line, don't you? Are one one pathetic weasel, Utley. Do you know that? I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'll wear the Augmentor. Does that make you happy? Because I don't want to leave one scintilla of doubt about this thing's safety. -But sir-- -Sh! Is the remote control unit online? -Well, technically, yes. I've been working out the bugs on the prototype at home. -You see? We are ready. Don't peck Daddy. Don't peck Daddy. [gasping] [beeping] [typing] -Guess what? I've got the prototype suit online. -What does that mean? -It means I booted up the controlled motion suit we have here. And it's talking to the Augmentor down at Crow Research. Someone could be testing even as we speak now. -Wait! What if they're testing it on my dad? -T minus 10 seconds for a picture. -Ladies and gentleman, this great day for Crow Electronics. What you are about to witness is a first in the history of technology, the coupling of two fields, both in their infancies. On the one hand you have electro-biostatic stimulation. On the other, controlled motion robotics. Coming together for the first time ever! [cell phone ringing] CROW: It is unbelievable and unparalleled in history, ladies and gentlemen. -Mm? Hello? -Dad, it's me. -Son, what, what, what are you doing calling me at work? -Are you all right? -I'm fine. OK? I'll get back to you. Um, bye. -All right, boys, we've got a picture. And guess who's on the Augmentor. CROW (ON VIDEO): Complete mobility. I would very much like to-- -Demonstrate this for you. To show you just how simple it is. [electric static] -(WARBLING VOICE) My colleague, Ms. Grimes, is wearing the controlled motion unit. Now the computer is going to interpret her motion. And it will send CROW (ON VIDEO): Those impulses to my Augmentor. An easy way to say it-- when she moves, I move. Ladies and gentlemen, our demonstration. [beeping] -Like that? -Mhm. Yeah. [metal scraping] [bar drops] -It wasn't me. I swear! -(WARBLING VOICE) Well then who-- [blowing raspberries] [zapping] -(WARBLING VOICE) Will you please turn it off? [barking] [laughter] JONNY: Cartwheel! Whoa! Whoa! -Moonwalk! Moonwalk! [laughter] -(WARBLING VOICE) Help us, please! [laughter] -Go! Go, Michael. Go, Michael! -(WARBLING VOICE) Ow! Would you please! [laughter] [shouting] [laughter] [shouting] -Is this part of the demonstration? [zapping] -You're doing great. -This is your fault, isn't it? [knocking on glass] -Somebody! Somebody! Somebody! -Ow! -Yeah. Bust out the karate moves. SAMANTHA: There you go. [punches] COMPUTER: Abort. -Utley! UTLEY: Are you OK, Mr. Crow? CROW: Will you get over here, please? -Mr. Crow! -Get me out of this, will you? -Let me help you up, sir. CROW: You better figure this out. FLUTIE: Crow. Crow! Obviously you have to work out some glitches. -Mr. Flutie, it will all be worked out. -Call me tomorrow. -I will. I have you on speed dial. UTLEY: I'm sorry, sir. But I told you there were bugs. -You are a bug! Now you're going to wear this Augmentor tomorrow for the demonstration. Or you're fired-- no benefits, no pay, no nothing! Help me up! Help me up! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Grimes? -Yes, sir? -Follow me. -Yes, sir. -Are there any messages? -Just one. [slapping computer] MILES: Check it out. Eyes and ears of the augmented P.U.N.K. Everything you see, hear, and say in the field is transmitted right back here to master control. -Hey, good job, man. Good job. JONNY: This is so cool! -Incoming, guys. Guys, come on! CROW (ON RADIO): As a matter of fact, we're trying to handle the situation as we speak. Well, I think we're just going to have to bring in that very special extermination team right away, don't you? Well, I've identified two targets already. I have great leads on two others. -And I think we're just going to have to silence them permanently. Mhm. All right. Now there's one other thing. There's an FBI agent. Houlihan. Houlihan is Crow enemy number one. As soon as we terminate these punks, I want to take care of Houlihan. The address, 1140 Peach Street. Thank you. -You know what? Too rich for my blood. It's been real, guys. -Hey, wait! Maybe we can go to this Agent Houlihan guy and ask him for help. -The already know me. I trust no one. SAMANTHA: JONNY: Me either. -We could get nailed on the way over there. -Then I'll wear the Augmentor, and I'll go to Houlihan's. -Yeah. I'm sure you will, Drew. I say we cut our losses, disappear for a while. Every man for himself. -Maybe we'll all be better off on our own. -You know what, Drew? They're right. Let's just lay low for a while. -Totally agree. You know I'm on probation right now. [interposing voices] -Wait! This isn't just about you. It's about all of us. I mean, don't you guys get it? Crow is the bully now instead of Ronny. And the bullies keep on winning because we all bolt instead of sticking together. I mean, we've come this far together taking chances. And now when my dad needs us the most, how can you all bail? What happened to the P.U.N.K.S.? United we stand. -Nice speech, Utley. I'm gone. -I just thought we were all friends here. -My friends? -Yeah, Jonny, why? -Nothing. I just never really had any real friends before. I gotta do what I gotta do. -He's right, Drew. We're in over our heads. We're just kids. Let your dad handle it. Make him turn in Crow. -Drew, I'm sorry. I just-- I can't. You gotta understand. I just-- I can't. See ya. -I'm too young to die, Drew. -Go then. Get out of here! [beeping] [phone ringing] -I'm not here. Just picking up something for the office. -Utley residence. It's your boss. He wants you back at the office immediately. [grunts] -Pat, if the horse is dead, get off. [door opening] -Hey, Drewster? Drewster? Son, there's something very big that I have to do today. And I need your support. Dad, don't go. -I have to. If I don't do it now, I might not have the courage to do it all. I need to take this. -Dad. Dad, please don't go. Dad. Dad, don't go! Dad, please! -Drew, please. Now don't make this any harder. Are you all right? -Dad. I have to get back to you on that. [tape rewinding] CROW (ON TAPE): Oh, and then there's one other thing. There's an FBI agent. Houlihan. Houlihan is Crow enemy number one. The address, 1140 Peach Street. -Hi, I'm Special Agent Houlihan. You must be Drew. Are you alone? -Uh, yes, ma'am. -I'm glad you called. You're doing the right thing. Come in. Make yourself comfortable. Thirsty? Can I get you anything? Lemonade? Soda? -No thanks. I'm fine. -Well, I'm glad you came. Tell me what's going on. -My dad's in trouble. He works for this guy named Crow. -I know. The FBI has been investigating Edward Crow for some time now. Your testimony is just what we need to solidify the case. You were right to come in when you did. -I was? -Absolutely. Have you ever been deputized? -Deputized? -We're allowed to deputize civilians under special circumstances. Here. This badge represents your official appointment. Hmm. Hmm. Now, where is that little Augmentor? SAMANTHA (ON EARPIECE): Hey lover boy, pay attention to what you're doing. -Is this what I think it is? -United we stand, right? -You betcha. You're a full-blown deputy now. -Gee, thanks. -You're welcome. -I hate to say it, Romeo. But I smell a rat. -What? -I said you're welcome. -Get her out of the room? -How? -How, what? -How did I get so thirsty? Maybe I will have that lemonade, please. -Drew, it's Miles. Put your glasses on so we can get a visual. DREW (ON MICROPHONE): She sure drinks a lot of coffee. -You smoke? HOULIHAN: No, I don't Why? -Tell her you smoke. -Just wanted to bum a cigarette is all. HOULIHAN: Smoking's bad for you. You know that? -Yeah. What can I say. I'm trying to quit. Hey, uh, can I use your bathroom? -Upstairs. The second door to the left. -Thanks. -Come on. Man. I gotta eat. -Drew to master control. Samantha, Miles-- DREW (ON MICROPHONE): I'm glad I have you guys back. -We're all back. We decided you're hopeless without us. -Gee, thanks. Listen, I think we've got a problem here. I'm thinking this is a trap. SAMANTHA (ON EARPIECE): Affirmative. -We tried to radio contact Crow but the signal was dead. He must have found the bug. Abort the mission. Get out of there. -Way ahead of you. -Going somewhere? [woman screaming] [grunting] -Hey, check this out. -Ah! -He's getting away. Get him! What are you waiting for? Move it! Move it! -That's all right. He's not going to lose us. Let's do it. [tires squealing] -Yo, base. This is Drew. I've got a situation here. They're creeping up on me like a pair of ladies underwear. Any ideas? -Go faster. -I can't lose them. They're going to run me down. Augment! [zapping and yelling] -Go right. Go right. Go right. Left! Left! Left! -Is this map right? According to this tracker, he just got on the freeway doing 60 miles an hour? [cars honking] -Oh my god! -(WARBLING VOICE) Guys, I'm on the freeway. [cars honking] LANNY: Oh, watch out! [cars honking] -Don't worry, Drew. I got you covered. Take the next exit. I gotta plan. [tires squealing] -Where is he? -Looks like the U-district. -Oh yeah. That's the ice cream shop right off Pioneer. I'd know that in my sleep. [tires squealing] [truck horn honking] -Look out! [truck horn honking] [screaming] [cars crashing] -Miles says to watch your gauge. More than 20 minutes on the Augmentor could permanently fry your nervous system. [panting] [tires squealing] -Drew, it's Lanny. In this movie on Mars with Arnold, you know, his eyes were like popping out of his head. They put a homing device in his head so that he could track him. Did anyone, like, you know-- DREW (ON MICROPHONE): What? Put anything up my nose? No! Jonny, when does this great plan of yours kick in? -Right now. Remember Bruno? He got his BMW back. [glass crashing] [car alarm blaring] -(WARBLING VOICE) Deputize me, huh? Chase this. Ugh. [tires squealing] -(WARBLING VOICE) Hey! Hey, guy! There's this guy who's trashing your car over there. [gun cocks] -Car shopping? -Stop right there. Not one more step. You were supposed to mow the lawn today. Dad's orders. -I will later, Mom. -No, not later. Now. And when you finish mowing the lawn, blow the leaves. And you gotta rake the grass and put it in a pile. -Come on, Mom. -Come on, just pretend you're on one of your little missions, you know? And that like you're this big international spy, right? And it's like all cloak and dagger and the danger's on. And your cover will be, let's see, I got it! A kid doing chores. -I'm in the middle of a delicate mission. -There you go! That's the spirit! -Unbelievable. -Just do it. [zapping] [lawn mower] [zapping] -Hey, Drew. See, that wasn't so bad. -Mr. Crow. -We've been waiting for you. -Sir, I've been agonizing over this for weeks. And I've come to the conclusion that I can no longer condone or be a part of what this project has become. My family and my peace of mind must come first. Therefore, I am resigning. -Are you sure? -Yes. -Nothing can change your mind. -No. -All right then. -What are you doing? -Make a fist. -Arg! -Enjoy your peace of mind. Good boy. Good boy. [door opening] [wires sizzling] [static] -Hello, Drew. Guess what? You've got exactly one hour to get that Augmentor and the files back here to the lab or your little friends get it. -Drew, hurry. -Drew, oh please, help! [door slams] [lock clicks] -Got it? On your mark, get set, go. [laughter] -A good general knows that giving a directive is one thing, having it carried out is quite another. With our Augmentor, not only will a soldier have super human strength but a general can virtually send him into the teeth of battle with 100% percent certainty that that directive will be carried out. Now we are very fortunate today that our demonstration is going to be carried out one of our creators, one of our designers. Say hello. [mumbles] -Thank you. I know that you will be impressed. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the demonstration. [mumbles] [groans] -Yah! Ha, ha, ha! Watch this! Hiya! -Now, sir? -No, no. Not yet. Give him a few more seconds. -He's never going to show. I mean who are we kidding? -Hey! You can't come in here. Hey, you can't come in here! [air gun blowing] -Whoa! -Oh! Hey, shut that thing off, kid. Shut that thing off. [punches and groaning] -Now? -Hit it. [machine whirring] [zapping] [warbled yelling] [punching] [bones crunching] [screaming] -Pulse is already 210. His heart is racing. BP, 240 over 150. -What you're seeing is completely normal. [punch] [yelling triumphantly] -Hey! Don't mess with my dad. -All part of the show. Just adding a little spice. -(WARBLING VOICE) Dad! [punch] -Oh! -I knew he'd show. Believed in him the whole time. [screaming] -(WHISPERING) Get the Augmentor off him. [beep] -Untie us! -Get it on me. Get it on me. [murmuring] -All right, let's get out of here. Hurry up. -(WARBLING VOICE) Jonny, go call the cops. -Come here, you. -Hey! [punching and groaning] -(WARBLING VOICE) Yo, scumbag! Let's rock. -I want my Augmentor back. -Come and get it. -Oh yeah! [zapping] -Come on! Hurry! Hurry! -Come on! -Cover! -Get lost! -What the? -Now let me just tell you something. My Augmentor has twice the power of yours. -Oh yeah? -Oh yeah. [alarm blaring] -Hey, have you guys met? [groaning] -Come here you little-- [grunting] [laughter] [grunting] [stick falls] -Hey, get over here. I need a cop up here now! [clicking] [air blowing] -Stay back. Or I'll Poupon you. Get it? Poop on you? [splattering] -Ugh! [laughing] CROW: Come here. Ugh. [groaning] -You've got the wrong person! -Do not let her pretty face fool you! Take her. Go! -Oh. -Get up! Boy, I want you to really feel this. [machine whirring] [punching] -You had this coming, mister. [punches and groans] [glass breaking] -Drew! Yo, Drew. Wake up man! Yo, this isn't funny. Come on! Wake up, brother! -Ugh! -Yeah! [cheering] -Drew! -What on earth happened to you? -Long story. How's Dad? -He's sleeping. Sh. -No, I'm not. I'm awake. Son, we know where you were today. -You do? -Mom said she saw you heading toward my office on a mountain bike. You were there watching the police take over the building, weren't you? -Sort of. -I want you to know that your father had nothing to do with any illegal activities. -I know. -All I ever wanted to do, son, is help people who were weak. I'm sorry I neglected you. I was weak. I was a weak father. I let you down. But no more. No more, mister! -It's OK, Dad. -Ha, ha, ha. [yawning] -Guess we better do something about that black eye. -Why is he so tired? -Well, he did mow and rake the lawn today. -Oh. MILES: Let me go. Get your hands off of me. All right. Let me go. Let me go. You don't know who you're messing with. Oh no. Oh no you don't. Oh no! -All right, creep. This is safety commissioner Utley. Put the kid down. You're in violation of safety code B-1523. -What happened to Spengler? -He got lead poisoning trying to invent cold nuclear fusion. There's a new sheriff in town. -Yeah? So what are you going to do about it you little punk? -That's Mr. P.U.N.K. to you. You're going to the principal's office one way or the other. Now we can do this the easy way or the hard way. -Make me. -Bad choice. [zapping] -(WARBLING VOICE) Come to papa, Ronny. [yelling] -Whoa! -Ah! -Hey, you guys listen to this. "Conspirators Edward Crow, accomplice Denise Houlihan, and arms dealer Jack Flutie were arrested Saturday for attempting to sell sensitive defense technologies to Middle Eastern buyers. Now authorities claimed the perpetrators were brought to justice by a special covert team of operatives code named the P.U.N.K.S." -Oh yeah! -Baby baby! [music playing]
