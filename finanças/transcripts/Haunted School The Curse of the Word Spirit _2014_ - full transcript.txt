"A... B... C... D... E..." What are you doing? It's a secret Practicing your writing? Hey, isn't that a Ouija board? Ouija board? You don't know? I know. We did it in middle school Pretty retro It's not a game to play in high school It's not a game Wasn't Ouija banned in middle school? As if the school could control Ouija! In middle school, a girl in a seance suddenly started gasping Wasn't it just anemia? You ask it stuff like, "Who has a crush on me?" It could be more fun to play now! Stop it. You can be heard By whom? Once you call a spirit, it lingers Lingers? Why not? A mysterious transfer student Stop it! Why are you so serious! This coin could hardly move on its own, right? You move it yourself In other words, it's like a frank conversation Finished Hold on Where's the shrine gate? Both of you, put out your hands Our hands? Ah, you mean for palm reading? Put your hands on mine You sure this is the Ouija game? It's scary What do we do now? Move the coin with our other hands? Apologize Huh? What do you mean? Both of you, apologize Apologize for what? Forget about that. Let's start the game Apologize Forget it. I'm sick of this Who the hell are you! Let go of me! KOTODAMA - SPIRITUAL CURSE Huh? What? The 10 yen coins What is it, mom? "YEAR 1 CLASS 3" A once sullied conscience will never be pure again "YEAR 1 CLASS 5" What are you doing, Mei? What are you standing here for? Just thinking about the room next door Room? It's a classroom That's all, right? It's Year 1 Class 4, right? It was Class 4 There used to be more students so we had Class 4 and 5 Now there are only three classes But there's still Class 5 Half of this school building is unused Even with fewer students, the building stays the same It's probably a storeroom Storeroom? I don't know for sure, but I think so Mom Do you want to tell me something? All four coins are dated 1988 Mom What is it? Did something happen in 1988? "DIARY 1985" "DIARY 1988" Isn't it weirdly hot today? It's too hot! I want to dive into a pool of iced water Don't keep saying how hot it is. It feels even hotter If it's hot, you say it's hot! It's hot in there too, right? Class 4 What is it, Yuri? Nothing Class 4 is next to Class 3, right? Stop it. There's no Class 4 That's right. There is no Class 4 So why was it abandoned? Abandoned? Just Class 4... yet Class 5 remains Just bad luck Eh! Is that true? Because 4 can be read as "death"? So there was no Class 4 from the beginning? No. If that were the case, Class 4s would disappear from all Japan But there are hotels with no Room 4 You mean like buildings abroad with no 13th Floor? Stop this creepy talk! Room 42 is seriously weird Weird, how? I stayed at this hotel once... and saw this boarded-up room It was room number 42 Stop it! I went to the room in the middle of the night There was this rattling sound... like something trying to get out of a well A woman's hoarse voice saying... "Let me out!" "Let me out of here!" Stop it! Well, you said it was hot That cooled you down a bit, right? It's just a silly story, Mei It used to exist Next door used to be Class 4 So why is it like that now? It was sealed up after an accident An accident? How do you mean, sealed up? There was a poison gas incident Gas? Poison? Did someone release gas in the classroom? It came from underground Underground? Is this for real? Yeah Suddenly gas leaked in the middle of class Students started falling unconscious... one... after another... they bowed down at their desk The teacher who noticed the change... thought they were all sleeping at first Even the English teacher giving the lesson... collapsed over the teacher's desk Was it natural gas? It could have been a chemical weapon... developed during the war and buried underground Did they die? They were all rushed to hospital... but only a few came back to school Why was only Class 4 affected? The gas was buried right underneath it So Class 4... was the "death class" after all Yuji, how long ago was this? I dunno There should be records, news articles, on such a major incident Someone's tricked you, Yuji Believe what you like But that's the true story of next door... Year 1 Class 4 "August 5. I need to write down my feelings about Class 4 vanishing" "It happened last month, July 18" "An unidentified gas rose up in class. The teacher and all the students... were rushed to hospital" "But only 8 students returned" "The death of a single classmate is painful enough" "Their parents gave me 10 yen coins" "When I die, I hope you'll all come see me" "I'll bring the 10 yen coins with me" July 18 Uh, first, calculate cosine theta... AM = MD... = 2A So, sine... What? Don't mess around I'm not Can't you hear a strange noise? Noise? I can hear a weird noise from behind me No You're such a scaredy-cat, Mei It's an old building. The steel frame shrinks, pipes creak... it happens all the time And the sound of Class 4's footsteps They died in their sleep, so they've not realized yet... You mean they're still studying next door? Stop it You know Mei's a scaredy-cat Don't take any notice Looks great. We can shoot something awesome here Which room? The science lab? The toilet of course The toilet? It's gotta stink Deal with it. Anyway, the stink won't show on screen Kazuki! Let's go back Don't worry What happens if we're found? Don't worry about it.

Don't scream when you see Yoshito The set up is that you only notice him in playback, not during the shoot I can't do it Don't say that. We've come this far Hey, come here a minute This story's so unrealistic No girl would be so stupid as to come in here Why don't you do it yourself! You idiot. It's scary because a girl's doing it That's what horror is about A helpless girl in a place she shouldn't be... that's horror! - I'm not helpless - What? Shall we do a test? A test? Make fox heads with both hands Twist them around and join your fingers Peep through the window you just made Can you see anything? Um, no It's called the Fox's Window. You can see the spirit world Huh! Stop it! It's fine. You're helpless enough See, you are helpless What's your normal temperature? Around 35 degrees Well you don't have a fever then You'll recover if you sleep Yuri, what happened? What happened? I'm fine. It was just anemia Sorry Sorry for what, Mei? I'm such a scaredy-cat, it's affected you too No It's not that. It's not your fault Let her sleep Yes You're OK, right? Thanks Now, you have a good sleep Nurse! What?

Just go to sleep Don't think about anything, just sleep On a day like today A day like today? They say this used to be a hospital Really? Oh no, stop it! You really love urban legends It's true! I checked the town records It's not something I heard from someone Do you know the story about the girl who vanished from the hospital? - No! What is it? - You don't know? This little girl in hospital woke up in the middle of the night... and went out of her room looking for her mother A nurse realized and started looking for her... but she was nowhere to be seen anywhere in the hospital In the morning, all they found was her sandals Her sandals? She'd kicked them off in front of a mirror A mirror? Where had the girl vanished to? The rumor was she'd been sucked into the mirror That mirror is still here You don't mean, that mirror? Yes! That one. The large mirror on the staircase Stop messing around This was never a hospital Why are you so mad? It's all just a made-up story right? Stop! Even if it is just a story, you shouldn't tell it What is it, Mei? Don't you know about Kotodama? Kotodama? The power of words to attract Attract? When you say something out loud, it can make it real The spoken word has that power I want a hot boyfriend You'll get one soon! Now you've said it That's what you mean, right, Mei? Hey, Yoshito. Are you ready? - Yeah, in a minute - Let's shoot OK, let's do it We're shooting Yoshito! Creepy! Looks like something will appear At first I thought, "Why would a girl come to this weird place?" But then I thought again, and it's still... stupid! It's scary! Ah, gross! There's not going to be anything in here, right? Creepy - Wow! Did you see that? - I saw it! Fantastic work! Wow! It's the real thing! That'll get over 100,000 views on the net We'll get loads of sponsors Hey Yoshito! Come see this Yoshito You can come out now What's he up to? What the hell is he doing? Using the toilet maybe? No shit What? Taking a dump Seriously? What if we shoot the ghost taking a dumpâ€¦ could be fun? Where the hell is he? Idiot Yoshito! What's up with you!

Where's she gone? Who cares? We got something awesome here! If we get a bite here, we need a 2nd and 3rd clip or we lose out on the money Which way did I come in? They think I really am a stupid girl Huh? This is where we came in right? We must have gone wrong somewhere Maybe someone fixed it while we were shooting? No way How did Hitomi get out? Oh no I never took this route What is this place? I hate it! Which way? Which way is it? Yuri? Excuse me Where's Yuri? She went back Went back?

What the hell? Miyu! Miyu! Miyu! Hey, Miyu! What did you see? We didn't come this way I know. Do you wanna find the exit or not? Where are we? Something's not right Shut up, Yoshito Where's the exit? How about thinking for yourselves once! Something's definitely not right Shut up! I shouldn't have been on the video When you came in to shoot in the toilet... I didn't show my face I was squatting down What were you up to? In that case... What the hell is that? I don't know! Don't get worked up! I don't know what that is on the tape! But... Isn't this you, Yoshito? Give it to me! What the hell? What's going on? It's fine If we've captured the real thing, it's even better! Bullshit! I'm the one who shot it Shut it! No need to tremble just because you shot a ghost! You're like a person from the past afraid that a camera will steal his soul Don't say that That means, since I shot a ghost, I captured its spirit! Even better! A ghost's spirit resides in this video! Don't say that! Forget it! Just think about getting out of here! Hold on Before that, you'd better apologize Apologize? If you don't apologize... it'll probably... follow us That's bullshit Yoshito's probably right Not you too! Why should we apologize? We've done nothing wrong! We're just trying to entertain people! - Who's that? - How do I know! She photographed us! Maybe she knows where the exit is? Maybe she does, but we shouldn't show our faces! She's already seen us, and photographed our faces! Is she human? Maybe it's the thing that's following us? Enough of your bullshit! We've been seen Maybe We've definitely been seen! So why didn't she react to us? I don't know Because she's not human Shut up Yoshito! What are you doing? We can't take this with us. We have to dispose of it here Don't! I'll take it back What are you going to do with it? Put it on the web of course! Don't! Putting it on the web is no joke! Don't you want the money? I don't want money from this! Who knows how we'll be punished! What a pair of spineless losers! Even if ghosts did exist... we living things are stronger You've not seen one You've not seen one, that's why you can say that Yoshito... What did you see? Hey... tell us! What did you see in the toilet? How can we know unless you tell us? Apologize? Who are we supposed to apologize to? When you were shooting in the toilet... the face that appeared... wasn't me Hey, Yoshito. Are you ready? We're going to shoot Yeah, in a minute OK, let's do it We're shooting Yoshito! Yuck! It's creepy Looks like something will appear At first I thought, "Why would a girl come to this weird place?" Gimme, gimme! Gimme, gimme! Gimme, gimme! Gimme, gimme! It's scary! Ah, gross! There's nothing here is there? Scary Apologize Though you probably won't be forgiven Welcome back Hey, something's wrong Wrong? Nobody's around Nobody? We're the only ones in school! The only ones! What the hell is going on! You gotta be joking! You gotta be joking! This can't be right This is the same corridor as before! What the hell! Stop it! Stop it! What's this? What the hell is it? "Year 1 Class 4" Why are we locked in? What's happening? We're being punished Punished? We... were laughing and talking nonsense Nonsense? This used to be a hospital, and... there was a gas incident next door in Class 4 That's why these three... as if sleeping Hold on! The story about Class 4 is true! Did we attract this? Is this Kotodama like Mei said? Calm down everyone Now we can't get out of here And this is my fault now? That story about Room 42 in the hotel You saying my story is the cause of this? She didn't say that It was just a made-up story There's no locked Room 42... and I never heard a woman's voice You idiot! That's exactly what Kotodama is! Something said carelessly... that becomes real Shall we get out of this classroom? We should This is where we told the weird stories Yeah "Broadcasting Room" What's this? Dunno They're looking at us Shit. They could report us Wait It's the same for them What is it? What are you doing here? Same for you. What are you doing here? Same as you What do you mean? We came into the school building... out of curiosity What do you mean, curiosity? We're students here How do we get out of here? We can't open any of the doors We don't know But you're students here, aren't you? Leave it Something's not right with them Hello Hello, Kitayamada High School What's that? What's what? Who is it? My name is Shiori Did you hear something? I'm a graduate of this school Now, it's a school with no students But... it's full of its graduates' memories A school with no students? Unfortunately... my year was the final graduation year Did she say, final graduation year? This school building... will only exist in our memories Kitayamada High School... will be a school that only remains in our memories What nonsense is this? What does she mean, a school only in memory? We're not someone else's memory! What's wrong with them? What are they talking about? Let's go, before we go crazy too Soon... the school building will disappear Disappear? This old building... so familiar to all its graduates... will be demolished soon Demolished? When was that decided? The three years I spent here were brilliant However... to the graduates... not all the memories... were enjoyable "Diary 1988" Today... when I read the diary of my mom, who also graduated here... I discovered this school's sad memory The end-of-term exams were over... after school on a summer day near the end of the semester... the accident happened Accident It was... during English class Gas leaked into the classroom... killing students in a terrible accident A gas leak? This accident... Is it the one... that Yuji was talking about? My mother... was a student in Year 1 Class 4 The class in the accident It's a lie! What's wrong, Yuji? That day... mom's class... Year 1 Class 4 disappeared She... recorded that day in her diary By chance, that day... she... caught a cold and stayed home And so escaped the accident But... in an instant... she was pulled to the depths of solitude To my mother... of course, losing her close friends from middle school days... and then the whole of Class 4... was really painful Stop it! But... Your story was true, right? I made it up It was a made-up story Of course it was a made-up story! A story told becomes real Kotodama The words attracted it! Shut up! Stop your nonsense! Mom... when she entered here in the spring... the four friends... took 10 yen coins minted in that year... placed them in the palms of their hands... and pledged their friendship... with 10 yen coins dated 1988 1988? 1988, what? It's 1988 now! That's right! This year is 1988! So she's saying... the gas incident has just happened? What's going on? Hey, somebody explain! My mother... passed away last year She... kept those precious 10 yen coins... until the very end Today... I discovered those 10 yen coins left to me... and, for the first time, their meaning And today, July 18... is the day of the accident So I decided to come here... on behalf of my mother to express her gratitude... to the vanished Year 1 Class 4 of 1988 Especially... the girls who were close to her... and the owners of the three other 10 yen coins Ayano Miyu Yuri Thank you so much... for being good friends to my mother She... used to dream about meeting you again right to the end... so she wrote in her diary If you see her over there... please be good friends again I'll never... forget you Thank you... and goodbye Say... what year is it exactly now? Isn't it 1988? That means I'm in Class 4? She called my name too! Am I in Class 4 too? That means me too? Stop talking nonsense! Class 4 is dead! What the hell is going on! What the hell are we?
