[man coughing] - Jesus said, Matthew 5:38, "I know you have heard it said, "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, "but I say on to you, "resist yee not evil "but whosoever shall strick thee on the right cheek "turn to him the other cheek also." - [Man] That's right, Preacher. - Not that sounds like a Jesus of love to me. - [Congregation] Amen. - The Jesus we all love. Love lifted me. Love lifted me. When nothing else could help, love lifted me. Now I like that. Now we talk about love and we talk about turning the other cheek. We have a good example here today. Brother Dean's with us today, hasn't been here in a year or so. It's awfully nice to see you again, brother. For those of you who do not know Brother Dean, he used to quite a heavy drinker. Is that right? [Dean chuckling] When he met his wife, Pauleen, in fact, the way he met his wife, Pauleen, he was driving through town one day drunk as a skunk. [congregation laughing] Jumped the curb, hit Pauleen's mailbox. Two by four hit her across the jaw and broke her cheek. [congregation chuckling] Now the way I see it, she only had two choices. One, turn the other cheek, take a chance on it getting broken. [congregation laughing] Or snap him like a twig, I think she could've done it. [congregation laughing] But what did she do? She showed him love. She took him in and showed him love. - [Man] Amen. - And what did she get for it? Three of the most beautiful children in the world. Four? Well, congratulations, Brother Dean! I see now why you haven't been to church lately. [congregation laughing] Of course, the other side of that coin, I was in Madison County preaching and I heard a story about a man came in late one night after gambling all night long, lost every bit of his week's paycheck. Well his wife had just about all of that she was gonna take and she hauled off and hit him as hard as she could hit him. And what did he do? He had the same choice as Pauleen did. Did he turn the other cheek, no-ho-ho. Knocked her across the room. [congregation murmuring] Now what'd he get for that? A divorce and two years in jail. [congregation laughing] And what'd she get? 150 acres of the best bottomland in the county and the last I heard, she was off with the man that won the money from him in the poker game in the first place. [congregation laughing] Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord. - Amen. - Amen! - [Man] Amen! - And you know, we all have out fights. We all fight in our own ways. But our fight is not with men, our fight is with the devil! Am I right? - [Congregation] Amen! - Now the devil, you gotta be careful. He'll sneak up on you when you're least expecting it. He'll jump up and he'll grab you and he'll tear at you. He'll try to take you down with him. But you gotta fight back. It's the only way you're gonna beat the old devil. - Right. - The way to fight him is you gotta get right down in his face and say, Devil, you ain't getting this soul! Now isn't that right? That right, boy? Amen. Now what we all need to do it try to be more God-like. - [Man] Amen. - Brother Hofelter, you're trying to be more God-like, don't you? - Oh, do-do-do, Matthew, that's a fact. - Good, I need you to help me show something up here, Brother Hofelter. I wanna show the people how the Lord works. - Okay. - Now Brother Hofelter, let me ask you something and you answer me truthfully. If I should draw back and hit you, could you turn the other cheek to me? - Why, Matthew, I can't answer a question like that. - Well, Brother Hofelter, I have an answer for you. I want you smite me on the right cheek. Well, smite me, Brother Hofelter. There was a time when you gladly smote me with a beer bottler, as I remember. [congregation laughing] - That was a long time ago, Matthew. - It was. And we were young, that's true, and children of the devil. We stand here in the name of the Lord and I want you to smite me, I want you to hit me as hard as you can. - You mean it, Matthew? - In the name of the Lord, smite me, Claude. [punch thudding] [congregations groaning] - [Matthew] Oh, baby. Oh. - Matthew. - [Man] He's gonna hit him back. - No, Claude. Love lifted me. - [Congregation] Amen. - Love lifted me. - Amen. - [Man] Amen. - I'll say this. You got the power of the Lord in your arm, Claude. [congregation laughing] Kinda expected on the right cheek though, Claude. [congregation laughing] Don't mind, I think we'll ask Brother Toomb's latest benediction. [congregation laughing] - The Lord bless the and keep thee, the Lord make his face to shine upon thee and be gracious under thee. The Lord lift up His countenance upon thee and give thee peace. Amen. - [Congregation] Amen. [people chattering] [somber organ music] - That was a fine sermon. - Thank you so much. - Good sermon, Reverend. - Brother Adams, nice to see you in church again. - Real fine sermon, preacher, we enjoyed it. Had us worried a little though. - Why didn't you hit him back, preacher? - Because, son, that's exactly what I was preaching. Turn the other cheek. - I woulda knocked his block off! - Didn't learn very much, did he? - Enjoyed it. - Thank you. - Was a really good sermon. - You look just like my mother. - God bless you. - Thank you. [motor puttering] - Thanks for your help. [people chattering] - Good sermon. - Will you lock up for us? - Sure. - Thank you.

You and your mom can take care of things until I get there, can't you? - Folks will be expecting you to run the cakewalk like always. - I'll be there, Emma. Just need to look in on Brother Simmons. He's been feeling kind of poorly lately. Likely as not he's coming down with something, seeing as how he wasn't in church this morning. This will perk him right up. - Uncle Matt? You want us to wait for you? It's a long walk up up to the Grange Hall. - No, I'll catch a ride, I'll just meet you there. - Mr. Simmons did leave work early on Friday. [motor rumbling] [birds chirping] [children laughing] [somber music] - Good morning, Matthew. - You're looking mighty pretty this morning, Brother Simmons. [woman chuckling] [church bells ringing] - [Emma] That's Becky Wagner, isn't it? - Yeah. She's Jimmy Joe's girl. I really don't know her that well. - You two been in the same class since the first grade, what do you mean you don't? You like her, don't you? - After we load up the food and all, do you think we oughta stop back by Mr. Simmons, pick up Uncle Matt? - Ed Simmons is gonna have a sore belly for a long time if he's waiting for your Uncle Matt to comfort him.

Cakewalk's gonna be starting soon. We've got another chance. - And thanks too to the Top Notch Lumber Company, Dee's Hardware Store-- - Two points. - Ruby's Luncheonette. And thanks, of course, to Hayden Lowery for these beautiful Christmas cakes which she's made us again. And now it's time for the cakewalk! Will you move... [people chattering] Oh, certainly. - May I have your attention up here, please? [people chattering] May I have your attention up here, please? - What is it, Preacher? Taking a collection? [people laughing] - Now you hold on there, Gatlin. I've got a very important announcement to make here. I know we all came here to have a good time but I'm afraid I have some bad news for you. The Japanese have just bombed an American naval base in Hawaii called Pearl Harbor. [people muttering] - Does that mean we're gonna have to go to war? - I don't know what this means. But I do know one thing, we're all gonna be forced to make some very serious decisions very quickly. - Tommy, what are we gonna do? - I don't know. I'm gonna go. - I want everyone to go home, stay calm, stay close to your radio and for God sake pray. [people mumbling] - There are West Virginians in Pearl Harbor. Bill Tucker's son. - Okay, boys, I'm signing up first thing in the morning! Who's coming with me? - I'll come with you, you can count on it! - [Roosevelt] Yesterday, December 7th, 1941, [airplane buzzing] a date which will live in infamy, [bombs rumbling] the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory!

[guys laughing] - There are no other scouts boys. [people chattering] - [Young Man] Go on, look! [guys cheering] - Keep it down, boys. There's more where that came from. I'm gonna get you a ring and I'm gonna send it to you. - Jimmy Joe. - And I'm gonna put your picture up too. I betcha I got the prettiest girl in the outfit. - Jimmy Joe, I'm not your girl. Jimmy Joe! - Now what're you tell me? - The same thing I've been trying to tell you for a long time. - At a time like this? Now you are my girl, you have always been my girl and everybody knows that. - Telling everybody doesn't make it so. - You are my girl. Now I'll only be going to bootcamp for eight weeks. So I don't want you seeing anybody while I'm gone. - No, Jimmy, please! Don't say things like this, okay? - This is not the end, Becky! You can bet on that! [upbeat marching band music] [crowd cheering] - Folks, folks! Please be quiet. I have asked Matthew Spencer if he would say a prayer on behalf of our boys going to basic training. Matthew? - Seems mighty funny to me that the preacher who's offering up the prayer to our boys that are going away to fight has his nephew living at home with his mommy. [people chuckling] - Would you mind bowing your heads in prayer for a moment, please? We thank thee, most heavenly Father, for this opportunity to come together to say goodbye to our boys who are off to basic training. Take care of them, look after them, train them well so that they might defend this country that we love so much. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. [crowd cheering] - All right, men, on the bus! - Hey, Tommy, what're you doing here with the men? [people chuckling] Will you take care of my girl, Paul? Make sure that nobody comes near her. - Don't worry, Jimmy. I'll take care of her real good for you. - [Lem] I want you guys looking out after each other, you hear me? Remember, you're brothers. Get tough. Take care of yourself. - [Jimmy] Bye, Daddy. - [Lem] Take care of yourself. You get mean. You get tough now. [guys chattering] - All right, knock it off, you meatheads! As of right now, you're in the United States Army and I expect you to act like soldiers! Sound off when I call your name! Carver, Joseph. - [Joseph] Here. - Dawn, Albert. - [Albert] Here. - Gatlin, James Joseph. - Yo. - [Sergeant] Luke. - Here. - Next time I lay eyes on Tommy Spencer, he better find a hole to crawl in. - He always does. - [Sergeant] Did I tell you to talk, mister? - No, sir. - [Sergeant] Then don't! - Yes, sir. - [Sergeant] Knowles, Benjamin. - [Benjamin] Here. [birds chirping] - [Matthew] You know, Tommy, I brought you along for companionship. You haven't said a word all morning. - I'm sorry, Uncle Matt, I was just thinking. What happened to my pa? - You know what happened to your pa, everybody does. - Yeah. Did he have a mean streak or was it just something that happened? - Your pa had no more of a mean streak than even I do, Tommy. - Well, he died in prison, you ended up a preacher. - You know, when I was 10 years old, my mother took me to see a traveling preacher. Boy, he could preach that hellfire and brimstone unlike anything I've ever seen. Not sure at 10 years old I knew what he was talking about but the people responded. Tommy, they would've jumped off this bridge if he had asked them to. I think that man changed my life. - Well you were a hell raiser just like my pa. [Matthew chuckling] - I was a hell raiser, till the day your pa went to prison and when I promised him I'd look after you, I realized I had to start looking after myself too. - I guess promises are a lot easier to make then they are to keep. But it's not just that I made a promise to my father, I really believe that fighting's not the way. And it just makes me sick to think that the whole world's fighting. But it is. So what am I supposed to do? - I don't have an answer for that, Tommy. But, you know, I think your problems are a lot like that old tree stump you been wrestling with. If you work at it a little bit every day, sooner or later, it won't be there to be in your way. [engine rumbling] [tires screeching] [man shouting] [metal clattering] - What're you doing? Get that thing out of here! - Sorry. [engine rumbling] - Him carrying lumber to build the volunteer roster, it doesn't seem right to me. I wonder what he told the draft board to keep from going. - Maybe he told them he as a girl. [Paul chuckling] I mean, we all seen him drive like one. - Yeah, I think he's starting to look like one too. [guys laughing] - Thanks, Tommy! We appreciate that! - Yes, sir. Mr. Henderson said anything you wanted. - Hey, Tommy! - Hey, Tommy boy! - Hey, Tommy! - Hey, when we join up next summer, you be sure to spell our names right! [guys hollering] All capital letters! You make sure you do it right! ♪ I'm gonna find me a feller ♪ A feller who is yeller ♪ And beat him red, white and blue ♪ [guys laughing] [water splashing] [guys groaning] - Jimmy Joe's gonna get you good! He's gonna get you real good! Maybe teach you how to be a real man! - Stupid commie! - Tell him, Billy! - [Paul] Yeah, come on back here, commie boy! [machinery hissing] [metal clattering] [machinery rumbling] [whistle blowing] - Hi, Uncle Matt. - You look like you're on your last leg. You getting enough to eat? - Yep. - Let me see this. That's just what I suspected. You really oughta start eating right, you know? You're too young to die. - I will. - You hurt your mama's feelings when you don't eat your food she fixes for you. And I care way too much about your mom to let you hurt her feelings. [machinery rumbling] [bell ringing] You get home this evening and make sure you get a good supper. - Oh, I'm not gonna go home. I volunteered for night work at that parachute factory. - Why would you do a fool thing like that when it's hard and as dangerous as this job is? What do you need two jobs for anyway? - I just felt I ought to. - Hard work is a virtuous attribute. Too much of it getting in the way of living. A boy your age oughta be out having a good time, shooting a little pool, chasing some of those pretty girls. - That's not what you preach at church. - I didn't say anything about catching them. I just said chasing. We got everybody here, Charlie? - I don't know what they sent you up here for anyway. - I just got hired on for night work. Mr. Woodward said you could tell me what I could do. - He did, huh? He also expects me to turn this sock factory into a parachute plant. - Well, I'm here to help. - Help what? All I got is a bunch of women and old codgers and you're gonna help? How come you didn't go help fight the war where you belong? What's wrong with you anyway? You got flat feet or cold feet? - Neither one, sir. - Well, get this thread to the women and be sure that they don't run out because those machines are real tough to set up if they go down. [machinery buzzing] [car engine rumbling] - Hey, Misses Quigly. - [Woman] Hello, Tommy. [pleasant music] [tires screeching] [upbeat instrumental music] [faint radio chattering] [engine rumbling] - [Girl On Radio] Can I speak with you? I can't help it because I always know about you because I wanna be just like. - [Woman On Radio] You are more like me than Erin is. - [Girl On Radio] Sure, she's like Jane. I'm like you. - [Becky] I'll be right back, okay? - [Clerk] That'll be fine. - [Girl On Radio] I wanna be like you. I wanna be like you when I grow up. I think you are the nicest lady in the world. I wanna sing just like Mama does. - Hello. - Can I help you? - Yes, do you have any asprin? - Sure do, what size? - Regular, I guess. - Regular. - [Woman On Radio] It'll be the happiest day in my life. - [Girl On Radio] I wanna sing better than anybody in the whole world. Maybe she doesn't like... - That'll be 16 cents. - Oh. That's not the brand I wanted. - Well what brand do you want? We have all brands. - Um... That's okay, my headache's gone. [cash register bell ringing] Becky, hold up, wait a minute. I think there's been a mix-up. I think... I have your magazine. They mixed up mine. - I don't think so. - Oh. How'd that happen? - Got me. - So how have you been? - Oh, fine, just fine. - You know, I'm sorry about what happened that day at the carnival. Jimmy Joe was awful. - That's okay. - Was that you that ride up on those grain sacks the other day? - Yeah, that was me. Some guy, he just wasn't watching where he was going. I had to swerve to miss him. [tower bell ringing] You know, it's almost lunch time. - Oh, don't let me keep you. - Oh no, no, no, that's not what I meant. I was gonna say that the cafe is right down the street and I thought maybe... [tower bell ringing] You know, we could... We could get a bite to eat. - Sure. Let's go. [Becky giggling] [faint upbeat music] Sure, I remember. That was the craziest Halloween I ever had. - How do you think it was for me? My truck broke down and I had to walk there all the way in the rain. - You looked so awful. - Sure I did. The coloring came out of my paper mache turned my skin orange. - You were the sorriest looking pumpkin this county's ever seem. - I won first prize. - Yeah, but Miss Quigly thought you were supposed to be a carrot. [Tommy laughing] I remember Jimmy Joe got so mad because he thought for sure he was gonna win. - What do you hear from him? - Not much. - I thought you were supposed to be his girl. Doesn't he write? - Well, he writes me but I don't write him. You see, I'm not his girl. That's what he tired to make everybody think but I'm not. [faint upbeat music] - What kind of pie are we gonna have this afternoon? - Oh. I think I'll have pumpkin. - So will I. [Becky and Tommy giggling] [car motors rumbling] [distant dog barking] - You're late! I was about to take your mother home myself! - Got a little held up. Something wrong with the Buick? - Putting her away for the duration. Old man Henderson has got a C sticker. But the Ford gets better millage. - Oh. - He'll sell this Buick for twice the price when the war is over. - Yeah, I guess if there's a dollar line around, Mr. Henderson will figure out a way to pick it up, huh? - That's for sure. Yeah. How's Miss Becky doing? - Just fine. - Yeah, Ralph's asking about her. - Is Ralph home from college? - Yeah, come in last night. He joined the Navy. Said he was gonna finish up school when the war was over. Miss Henderson just about had a hissy. - Guess it's a good thing they made the volunteer roster as big as they did, huh? - Yeah. I reckon. My nephew's going in. Every young man's got to have his war, I suppose. Part of the human condition. Oh, I had mine all right. Never told you about that. - No. - Damn German whiz-bang got both my ears. Part of my brain too, I recon. Why, I couldn't stand up straight for a full year. Sometimes, late at night, I can hear 'em. Whizzing and banging and raising all manner of hell. But I don't hear the birds sing and I ain't heard thunder in over 20 years. ♪ Over there ♪ Over there The Yanks are coming. Why in the hell do we have to do this all over again? - You know, the draft board says I don't have to go because, you know, being the only son and taking care of my ma and all that. Do you think I oughta enlist? - Nobody can tell anyone what to do, Tommy, you know that! Mr. Jefferson used to say to me, Car-Wash, the most important thing in the world is what a man thinks of himself, not what anyone else thinks. All that does is clutter up his head. [Car-Wash chuckling] - Which Mr. Jefferson might that have been? - Why, that'd be Mr. Thomas Jefferson, of course. - Of course. - He'd sit out on the porch there at Monticello and I'd bring his rig around and he'd say to me, Car-Wash, if people don't quit telling me what they think, I ain't gonna have time to write this here constitution. [Car-Wash laughing] - [Emma] Oh, Tommy, you're here, good! - [Tommy] Yep. See you later, Car-Wash. - [Car-Wash] All right, son. - [Tommy] Mom, what're you doing? - Oh, Flora couldn't get the laundry finished today, so I'm taking it home. With Ralph here, there's extra meals and all. Bye, Car-Wash! - [Car-Wash] Bye, ma'am. - Mama, you got no call doing this. Washing the Henderson's dirty underwear. - It's honest work. It's just a favor. Besides, Mrs. Henderson pays fair and it helps out. She's been good to us. - Mama, I should be the one that's taking care of us. - You? You should be taking care of the farm instead of working two jobs. - I will, Mama! - [Emma] Let's go. Ah. - I'm glad the mill's closed on Saturday night. I heard this is a really good picture. - Yeah, it is. I just wish they'd get some newer pictures here. - Like what? - Well, I hear they got "King's Row" over in Charleston. - Joan Henderson saw "King's Row." - Really? - Yeah, but she said it was horrible when Ronald Reagan loses his legs. - Well, I like pictures when they're real. You know, that's real life. - Not me. I like Walt Disney movies. Really! "Fantasia" is the best movie I've ever seen. [Paul spitting] [guys laughing] Somebody oughta teach you some manners, Paul Gatlin. - Oh yeah? Well somebody oughta teach this creep some manners. Splashing mud on folks. - Your mother would like to see you, I expect, chewing tobacco and acting like trash. - And my brother would like to see you hanging around old yellow belly, here. - Come on, Becky, let's go. - Hey, what's your hurry, Tommy? Have a cut of tobacco. - No, thank you. - Go ahead, come on, try it! - I said, no thanks. - Hey, look out, Paul. He's turning pale. I think he's liable to throw up on you. - No, now, now he ain't pale. No, that there is his natural color. Aint it, Tommy? Yellow. You know, you should naught be out with Jimmy Joe's girl. - Especially with him away, defending the country and all. - Jimmy Joe ain't got nothing to worry about. Look at him. He ain't no man. Come on! - Just fight him down and see what kind of a man he really is. - [Thug] Yeah, let's depants him! - [Paul] Come on, grab his arm while I get his belt! - Hold it, boys! Knock it off! Let him up! What're you boys doing? - This has got nothing to do with you, Preacher. [guy laughing] - You know, foolishness is bound in the heart of the child. The rod of correction shall drive it far from him. [guy laughing] - You use the good book for your own purposes. My pa says that. Yeah, well I'll see you in church preacher. - Yeah, say a prayer for us, preacher man! - Yeah right. You too, Mr. Yellow Belly! - I'm awfully sorry about that, Uncle Matt. - Don't worry about it, son, it's just horseplay. Why don't you go on upstairs and get cleaned up? You don't wanna keep the young lady waiting any longer. These boys, they're always in to something. - So why does he take it? - He's keeping a promise, Becky. - Yeah, I know. I just wish for once he'd knock 'em flat! - You know, his father killed a man. It was a fair fight. The jury paid no attention to that. Being locked up that long, I think that's what killed him. Something like that could change a boy's whole life. - But it's not only tonight. They're always picking on him. - You know, a flock of crows could take an eagle down. Don't make the eagle any less. He's had it pretty tough, you know. - Okay, Becky, I'm ready. Uncle Matt, you wanna go to the movies with us? - No thanks, Tommy, you see, I'm taking up a collection upstairs for the church robe fund. - In the pool room? - Seems like Brother Thomas slept through my sermon about the evils of gambling. He's donated three dollars already. - Oh. - You kids have a good time. - Good night. - Good night. - Night. - [Tommy] Oh. - [Becky] You all right? - [Tommy] Yeah, I just clunked my head on the steps. Look, we don't have to go to the movies. - [Becky] Come on, Tommy, forget about them. - Oh, it's not them, I can take that. It's... It's me! It's Uncle Matt fighting my fights. - Oh, Tommy. - Sure am glad he showed up when he did though. [Tommy laughing] - You know, I really like you. - Well, the whole town still thinks you're Jimmy Joe's girl. - I already told you, I'm not. - Well, it just doesn't feel right, me being here with you while Jimmy Joe is off in the army. - Well it wouldn't have made any difference if he was here because I already told him. Besides, you can't live your life to please other people. [Tommy chuckling] - That's easy for you to say. - Come on. I don't wanna miss the movie. - [Tommy] Oh. Two please. [explosions rumbling] [plane zooming] - [Announcer] German bombs fell across Europe this week as Luftwaffe attacks killed thousands. [explosions rumbling] Axis troops rolled into Russia and crushed local resistance. In France, the Fuührer's troops goosestepped along the Champs-EÉlysées as thousands of French patriots despaired. [boat horn blowing] German authorities in Paris have announced five executions and the deportation of 100 persons to Eastern Europe because of bombings and other underground assaults on German troops. [airplanes rumbling] In Burma, American and British flyers scored their most spectacular victory when the broke up bombing attacks on Rangoon by down at least 10 Japanese raiders. [airplanes buzzing] [Matthew snoring] [birds chirping] [rooster crowing] - Good morning, Matthew. - Oh, Emma, I'd give thanks to the Lord everyday for a week if you'd just make me a pot of coffee. - Oh, is that right? - I feel like I'm gonna die. I'm afraid I won't. - Well if you're looking for sympathy, you've come to the wrong place. [truck door thudding] - Oh, that's mighty nice of you. Just what's got you in such a bright and cheery mood this morning? - [Emma] Nothing! - [Matthew] You're burning about something. I can smell the smoke all the way over here. - Doesn't do me a darn bit of good to fix a fine big supper and then sit down and eat it by myself. You were gone all night. - When I am a preachin', it's my business. You can't put a clock on it. Folks out there need ministering to. - Oh, the whole county knows about your all night ministering. Matthew, if you're gonna expect people to keep coming to church on Sunday, you best keep your ministering confined to the needy. - That's what I was doing. Ministering to the needy. - I just bet you were and I bet she's just lying there smiling this morning. - Emma, sometimes you act just like a wife. Other times, dang, if I don't think you might like to take up preaching. - Oh, listen to who's talking. Matthew, when are you gonna stop playing at preaching and settle down? - If you hadn't married my brother, I would've settled down with you. One other thing, Emma, if it was me, I'd either hang 'em up or take 'em down. I don't think I'd do both. - Oh!

[military drumming music] [dramatic music] [saw buzzing] [machinery clattering] - Hey! Hey, Tommy, take five! [machinery powering down] [distant steam hissing] [machinery rattling] [gears cranking] [ominous music] [machinery rattling] - Hey, Charlie! Is Tommy still working with you? - Yeah, he's still up top, Matthew. [machinery buzzing] [ominous music] - Hey, Tommy! Tommy! [saw buzzing] [machinery rumbling] Get down from there! What the heck are you doing? What's wrong with you anyway? - [Tommy] I'm all right, Uncle Matt, I'm all right! - All right? I don't call falling asleep on dangerous equipment all right! - [Tommy] Oh, come on! - Come on, Tommy, you damn near got debarked up there! - Would you stop making such a raucous about it? I need this job! - You got your job! You're gonna work with me on the fields. - What're you talking about? - David Willis enlisted yesterday and I need someone to help me! You get in the truck, I'll show you what hard work's all about! [saw whooshing] [horse huffing] - Enough, boy. Get out of there! You keep up with me! [axes clanking] [saw whooshing] - There she goes. [tree crackling] - Timber! Look out, boys, here it comes! [tree rumbling] [horse neighing] [men chattering] How's he doing, Lem? - He ain't cut nothing but wood so far. As far as work, don't show me spit. - Well, what's your version of the story? - Well, I'm staying awake. Haven't cut off any toes yet. - Never got this much work out of Lem Gatlin. He's trying to run you in the ground, you know? [Tommy laughing] - I think he's doing a pretty good job. - You know, Tommy, you don't have to take this. Not from the old man, the boys, any of them. - Oh, it's all right, Uncle Matt. - Even a man of God like myself loses his patience every now and then. - I'm okay. - You know, man's only got two cheeks. He don't say what to do after that. I'd think about that. - I am thinking about it. [birds chirping] [cathedral bell ringing] - Well he has to go on Friday. - Gosh, that's a short visit. - I know. - Hey, Tommy, how're you doing? - Hi, Ralph. - You remember my sister, Joanne. - Oh sure, how're you doing, Joanne? - Hello. - Ralph's invited us all to the Daniel Boone for lunch. - Oh, I don't think so. I got a lot of work to do back at the house. But you go, Becky! - Please come, Tommy. Take at least one day off. - Well, you know I can't. Sunday's the only day I get some work done around the farm. - Every been to the Daniel Boone? It's very nice. - No, I haven't. - Well, if he doesn't want to go. - Hey, Tommy, if it's the money, don't worry about it. My treat. - No, it's not that, it's... I really do have a lot of work to do around the house. But you guys go and have a good time. And thank you, thank you. - Okay. Becky, see you later. - Let's go. [birds chirping] - Here we go. I wish you'd change your mind. - Thanks anyway, Ralph. Maybe some other time. - You name it. - Thanks. - Hi, Mrs. Spencer. - Hi, Becky. Ralph. Tommy said you were going on down to the Daniel Boone with the rest of them. - Well, I decided not to go. Where is Tommy? - He's out and back there wrestling with that big old tree stump again. You go on back. Here, let me take your coat. - Thank you. - Isn't that pretty? He's gonna be glad to see you. - Me too. - Oh. Becky, oh... [Becky laughing] [mud splashing] [Becky laughing] I thought you were going to the Daniel Boone. - Changed my mind. I wanted to be with you. - Oh. Really? [water sloshing] All right. Come here. - You wouldn't... You wouldn't dare. - I would! [Becky yelping] I'm gonna get you, Becky! - [Becky] Come on, you're slow! [pleasant music] - [Tommy] Why you running away, Becky? [Becky laughing] - [Becky] Come on! - Come on, Becky, just one kiss! [Becky laughing] - [Becky] Oh! - I'm gonna get you, Becky! Gotcha! [pleasant music] [Tommy chuckling] [faint radio chattering] - How's your mom, Tommy? - Just fine, Mr. Adams. - And your Uncle Matthew? - Same as always. [Tommy chuckling] - He sure does sell that fire and brimstone, don't he? - Hey, the Second Corp is in Africa. Isn't that where Jimmy and the boys are headed after basic? - Yep. They'll get to come home once before they go overseas. How're things going out at the mill, Tommy? - Just fine. - Hello there, Jess! - [Jess] How're you doing, Mr. Fouche. - [Fouche] How you doing, boy? - [Jess] Good to see you, sir. - [Fouche] Good to see you too. - How you doing, Jess? Good to see you, boy. - Fine, Mr. Adams. Great to see you, sir. - You're looking good. - [Jess] Thank you, it's been quite awhile. - Come right on over here and have a seat. - No, I just came by to say hello. Seeing as the army's already given me a pretty good haircut. - Now listen, we've been taking care of you since you were two years old. We'll tell you when you need a haircut. You sit down right there. Besides, it's free to any man in the service. - Thank you, Mr. Adams, I appreciate that. How're you doing, Tommy? - Hiya, Jess. - That'll be 50 cents, Tommy. - Yes, sir. - [Fouche] Hey, Jess, didn't I hear your pa say you're going overseas soon? - Yes, I'm going in a couple of weeks. - [Fouche] Yeah, I thought so. - Jess, it's really good to see you, boy. - [Fouche] We're proud of you. - [Adams] We really are. - [Fouche] Looking good, isn't he? - How about that hair? [men laughing] [tower bell ringing] [engine rumbling] [hammer thudding] [hammer thudding] [engine rumbling] - Hey, there goes Tommy Spencer! - Yeah, Tommy Spencer! - Come on, let's go! [guys laughing] - Hey, wait for me, you guys! [upbeat music] [engine rumbling] Come on, wait a minute! [tires screeching] [upbeat guitar music] [guys shouting] [thug banging] [metal clattering] [tires screeching] [exciting music] - Hey, commie boy! [bullies laughing] [metal clattering] [bully laughing] [tires screeching] [truck whooshing] [crows cawing] [birds chirping] - Tommy, what the hell are you doing out here anyway, boy? - I had a little accident. - Mama fretting over you, you're working too hard, you ain't eating right and... look at this mess. - Well, you tell her not to fret. I'll be home in a little while. - I ain't gonna drive off and leave you, son. - Oh, don't do that. What're you doing? - Working. Work is supposed to be good for a man's soul. Of course, if that was the case, yours would be as big as all outdoors. - Well, I get a lot of thinking done while I'm working. - Thinking, huh? - Yep. - Mr. Webster was about the most powerful man I ever knew for thinking. Car-Wash, he said, thinking is just about the finest thing that a man can do. [Tommy chuckling] - Mr. Webster, huh? - Mr. Daniel Webster, of course. He wrote right in his dictionary, "Worrying is about as useful as hitching up "a 20 mule team to pull down a mountain." - Well, I thought you was gonna help me pick up this number, huh? - Yeah. [Car-Wash chuckling] - [Woman] Hi, Tommy, how's your mother? - Fine, Mrs. Worthington. - Hey there, Tommy boy. Heard you finally signed up. - What're you talking about? - Paul said your name's going up on the volunteer roster. In fact, he's putting it there himself right now. - What the heck you think you're doing? - Hey, hold on, Tommy! There's nothing to get excited about. We just wanted the town to know how we really feel about you. [paint splashing] [Paul laughing] No doubt about it, that there's your color. - [Bully] It sure fits him! [bully laughing] - Come on, Paul! [horn honking] [tire screeching] Watch out now, Paul! He's gonna get you, he's coming up colorful! Come on, colorful, come on! [bully shouting] - Let go of me! [ominous tempo music] [Paul huffing] Come here! [Tommy huffing] You're not worth it. [dramatic music] I don't think I can take it anymore, Mama. Move, cow. [cow mooing] - Paul Gatlin and his buddies, you can't let them get to you, Tommy. - It's not just them, Mama! It's everybody in this town! The way they look at me and the things they say. And it's getting to Becky too. Of course she doesn't say anything, like you, she wouldn't. [Tommy sighing] It'd be easier going to war. - Now, Tommy, listen to me. You can't just go against your own feelings. Now if you make a decision, it's gotta be for your own reasons, not because you're being pressured by some folks. - But maybe they're right, Mama. [cow mooing] - Well I don't want you doing something foolish like your daddy did. - I gotta go. - You go on now, I'll finish up. - Tommy! See you next week. I'm on my way to Logan County for the revival. It's gonna be a good one. - Matthew, Tommy's talking about enlisting. [engine rumbling] - You know, I'm not sure he shouldn't. - What're you talking about? I need that boy here! I need him on this farm! - You know and I know that's not the reason. He is a grown man. Don't you feel what he's going through? - Matthew, I'm asking you to help me keep him home. - So what you want me to do is ask this boy to do something he knows is wrong. - Yes! Yes, that is exactly what I want you to do. And you're right, Matthew. This doesn't have anything to do with the farm. I'm scared. I'm frightened to death. I listen to that radio every day and I hear about boys dying over there and I don't want that child to die. - I don't want him to die either, Emma. We gotta have faith in the Lord. - The Lord? [Emma laughing] The Lord, oh! It sure is easy for you, Matthew. If something gets too tough or you don't have the answer, you just dump it off on the Lord. When you gonna stop hiding behind Him? You see, I'm calling on you, Matthew. I'm not calling on the Lord. - And I'm gonna be right here to help you. Just not today. I've got folks waiting on me and I've gotta go. He ain't gonna do nothing till I get back. - [Woman On Radio] I'm sorry, Herman. You see, there's a big, big war going on. [faint radio program chattering] - Mmmm. Delicious. Did you make these? - With my own little hands. [Becky laughing] Gracie Allen, I just love her. She really tickles my funny bone. - Funny bone? [Becky giggling] - Yeah. - Nobody really has a funny bone. - Oh yeah? - Oh, Becky! [Becky giggling] Becky, don't, please. - I didn't know you were ticklish. - Stop, Becky! [Tommy laughing] - I knew I could get you to laugh! - Oh, Becky, the news is on. - Come on. - Let's listen to the news, okay? - You haven't laughed in a long time. - Becky, please. - Come on! - I said, knock it off! - [Radio Announcer] Over one thousnad 292 dead or are missing. - Sorry, Tommy. - [Radio Announcer] While American troops face overwhelming odds on the far east. - I didn't mean to get you upset or anything. - [Radio Announcer] Meantime, in the South Pacific, the Japanese advance down the peninsula of Bataan and had laid siege on the island of Corregidor. American loses are reported heavy. And on the home front, 100 thousand volunteered to join the Navy since December 7th-- - I gotta go, okay? - [Radio Announcer] We'll have more news at our regular time. And now back-- - Tommy! [upbeat radio jazz music] [people chattering] [upbeat jazz music] - You want a cold one, Tommy? - Oh, no thanks, George, but I do need change for the telephone, please. How much do you think it'll cost me to call Logan County? - Oh, let's see, 60 miles, 45 cents, okay. - Logan County? They don't have no pretty girls in Logan County. - Is that a fact? - Mm-hmm. Give us two beers, Georgie pie. - He don't want none. Tommy said he don't want none. - Put your teeth in, George, I cannot understand a word you are saying. Two beers, I said. - I've got a phone call to make, Violet. - You know, Tommy, I never thought you were a dull boy. You sure are all work and no play. - Well, I wish I could stay Violet but I can't. - That'll be 20 cents. - Tommy doesn't have to spend his hard-earned money. Put it on our bill. - Does your date like you buying beer for other guys? - You know Ralph. He won't mind. [Tommy chuckling] Come on. Just one little sip. It'll start your feet moving. - I'll tell you what, Violet, you let me make my phone call and I'll come back right away and have that beer with you. - Come right back. - Promise. - Okay. I never knew you to tell a lie, Tommy. [people chattering] - Hello? - [Tommy On Phone] Hello, Uncle Matt, it's Tommy. - Tommy, are you okay? - I'm fine. - [Matthew On Phone] Is Emma all right? - Yeah, she's all right. Listen, Uncle Matt, I need to talk to you. I'm thinking about enlisting. - Enlisting, now Tommy, your mother and I have discussed this. If you wait till I get home, we'll all sit down and talk about it. - [Tommy On Phone] I need to talk to you now, Uncle Matt. - I'm sorry, Tommy, what'd you say? - I told you, I'm thinking about signing up. - You can't just up and do that, boy. Wait till I get back. - [Tommy On Phone] Well when's that gonna be? - Now, Tommy, the war's not gonna be over in a week. I'll be home in a few days. Where are you calling from? - I stopped by the Blue Room to use the television. - That's good. You know, Tommy, there's an old saying, give wine onto those that be of heavy heart. They've got beer at the Blue Room. It's about the same thing. Gladden your heart with beer, my boy. It'll make you feel better. - Uncle Matt, that's not going to help. What kind of preacher are you anyway? Sunday sermon's all you're good for because that's just talk. Gladden your heart. Just wish my pa was still alive. - Tommy. - I wish to God he was. He'd be here! - Tommy? [people chattering] [faint beat music] - Gladden your heart, Violet. [Tommy sighing] Gladden your heart. [somber piano music] - Did I hear you say something about giving wine? Sounds like you're having a pretty tough time. - On the phone? That's my nephew. He's having a tough time. - Well, if you need someone to talk to. - You know, I'm just not sure talking would solve a thing though. - Well maybe it's not talking you need. - My God, my God. Why has thou forsaken me? Why art thou so far from helping me? - You sound like a preacher. - It's because I am a preacher. - Well, I suppose a preacher has feelings and needs like any man. - Not a good preacher. And you know, that might be just what my nephew was trying to tell me. - Ralph's gonna be okay. Car-Wash will take him upstairs to go to bed. - Good. Now, come on, get going, get away from here. - What're you doing? - If his mother saw me out here. - Oh. Ralph's mother is a very nice lady. - I'm just afraid we'll wake up the whole house. - Oh. - Now, come on, let's go. - Where? - Well we could go back to the Blue Room and pick up some beer. - Oh. Give wine onto those with a heavy heart and gladden your heart. - Huh? [Tommy laughing] - Oh, nevermind. Oop. Here we go. [Tommy chuckling] Uncle Matthew has a forgetful nature. God bless him. [Violet chuckling] - Tommy, you are changing right before my very eyes. - Oh. How beautiful are thy feet with shoes. Oh prince's daughter. [Violet and Tommy giggling] - What? - And the joints of thy thighs are like jewels that are the work of the hands of a cunning workman. - I don't understand a word you're saying but I sure am beginning to love it. - It's the Bible. - That's the Bible? - Mm-hmm. "The Song of Solomon." Uncle Matthew is always quoting the Bible. Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times and be thou ravished always with her love. [Violet chuckling] - No wonder your Uncle Matthew's in such demand. - Hmm? - With ammunition like that. [Violet moaning] - [Matthew] Tommy. - Uncle Matt. What're you doing here? You're not supposed to be back till next week. - You know, Tommy, a lot of things between me and you haven't been right lately. This old stump's one of them. What do you say we get rid of it once and for all? - Okay. Real glad you're back, Uncle Matt. And what I said on the telephone, I'm sorry. - Never need to apologize when you're telling the truth. You know, you're right. I've been laying things on the Lord way too long. I've been getting the feeling He was getting a little tired of it too. You know, Tommy, if you were to enlist, Emma and I can take care of this place just fine. - What about the promise I made my pa? - Well, there's a difference between a barroom brawl and defending your country. I think your pa would understand. What about you and Becky? - Oh, well... I'd like to marry her. But... I've been acting pretty stupid lately. - Well, Becky's a fine girl. Man's lucky to love one good woman in his life. Especially one that loves him back. To have somebody that cares about you is the most important thing in the world. If you wanna marry her, sooner or later you're gonna have to ask her. - I will. I will. [wick sizzling] - You will if we hurry. - Yep. [explosions booming] - Yeehaw! [Tommy and Matthew laughing] Why, we made toothpicks out of that tree, didn't we? Let's go see it. - [Tommy] Your hat. - Oh, leave it, let's go! Yeehaw! [exciting marching band music] [crowd cheering] - Hey, there's Becky. Wait a minute, Pa. Be back in a minute. [exciting marching band music] [crowd cheering] Hey, Becky, hey! Hi. - Hi. - Well don't I even get a welcome? - Looks like the whole town's giving you a pretty big welcome, don't you think? - You didn't write. No picture neither. - Jimmy, I thought we settled all that before you left. - Yeah but I was hoping maybe you changed your mind. - Jimmy, I'm getting married. To Tommy Spencer. [upbeat marching band music] ♪ When my eyes are closed in death ♪ ♪ When I rise to worlds unknown ♪ ♪ And behold Thee on Thy throne ♪ ♪ Rock of Ages, cleft for me ♪ Let me hide ♪ Myself in Thee - Amen. - Wednesday night, when I was preparing my text for today's sermon, I decided on the 10 Commandments. And the more I thought about the 10 Commandments the more it reminded me of a story I heard. Preacher came to church one Sunday and the old deacon said to him, Preacher, what're you preaching on today? The preacher said, you know, Deacon, I don't know. I had a sermon all prepared. I got up this morning and someone had stolen my bicycle. And I was so upset, he told me I forgot what I was gonna preach about. The old deacon says, you know, if I think if it was me, Preacher, I'd get out there and I'd preach on the 10 Commandments. And when I got to thou shalt not steal, I'd lay it down and I'll tell you one thing, whoever stole your bicycle the Lord's gonna make them feel guilty, they're gonna bring that bicycle back. So preacher got up there and preached one of the best sermons he's ever preached in his life. When it was over, he came up to the old deacon and said, Preacher, mighty good sermon, very inspiring. I gotta tell you, I was a little disappointed. When you got to thou shalt not steal, I expected to hear you really hit it. I didn't notice any difference. Preacher says, you know, Deacon, I got to thou shalt not commit adultery and remembered where I left my bicycle. [congregation laughing] That's a funny story and I know that but, you know, sometimes funny stories have a way of hitting home and that one hits way too close to home for me. The 10 Commandments are for everybody, even preachers. There's another commandment that says something to the fact that thou shalt not lie. And I've done that, I've lied to you people. I've lie to the people who've care the most about me and I've lied to myself. Now some of you may have seen me out drinking, seen me in places I shouldn't have been with people I should've never been with and there's no excuse for that. So until I can straighten out some things in my life and get right with God, I can't be the minister of your church anymore. I'm truly sorry. [congregation murmuring] [birds chirping] [somber piano music] - Where do you figure they'll be sending you, Jimmy Joe? The Pacific, I bet. They say them Japs is all over their mileage down there. - By the time you get finished there ain't gonna be none left. - Hey, it ain't gonna take me as long as it took you two. I went up and volunteered with the Marines. - Hey! Little brother's a gyrene. You hear that, Jimmy Joe? - Hey, Marine green. Yeehaw! - Woo! [Luke burping] [Paul laughing] - Three more days. - Three more days? No, we got another week. - Yeah. - Three days, she's getting married. - Well you don't care nothing about that. - She ain't worth worrying about. - He just stays here. I mean, how'd she take up with him to begin with? I'm off fighting and he just stays here! - Will you forget it? - Hey, George, three more beers, huh? - It ain't worth thinking about, Jimmy. - Becky was my girl. Now come Sunday she's marrying him. Let's get out of here. - Hey, where we going, Jimmy Joe, huh? - I'm going to take back what's mine. [engine rumbling] [tires screeching] [ominous music] [door thudding] - Mama? I'm up here. Daddy? Is that you? I didn't hear the car. [eerie music] Jimmy Joe. What're you doing here? - I come a calling, Becky. - Jimmy Joe, please leave. - It was supposed to be you and me. Well now it's gonna be you and me. - Get out of my house! Get out of my house! - We'll see if he wants you then. - Joe, please leave! Go, just leave! No! No! No! [Becky crying] God, no! [sinister music] Please, leave me alone! Please, leave! [Becky crying] [cloth tearing] - [Jimmy] Shut up! [Jimmy slapping] [Becky crying] [sinister music] - Woo! - Yahoo! Come on in here, buddy! [upbeat jazz music] [people chattering] - Listen, Joanne, you gonna give me a little something to fight for? A little something to remember you by? Good evening, Preacher. - How's the army treating you, Jimmy Joe? - Fine, just fine. - [Man] See you later, Matthew. - Well, you knew I always liked you, Jimmy Joe. - Is that a fact? - Uh-huh. - How about a bottle of beer, George? [people chattering] [upbeat jazz music] - Hi, Tommy, where you been? - Let's go outside, Gatlin! - But what do I wanna go out in the cold for, Tommy, when I got me a nice warm girl, right here? - Go away, Tommy, we're enjoying ourselves. - Yeah, get out of here, get! Go on! Come on, go on! [people giggling] [upbeat jazz music] Get going, yellow. [Jimmy Joe laughing] [Joanne laughing] Come on, Joanne, do your thing. Go on, yellow! - Hey, commie! Yellow-belly! [thugs laughing] [door clicking] [crowd silencing] - Get him, Tommy! Hit his jaw! [punch thudding] [crowd shouting] [jukebox crunching] [exciting jazz music] [glass shattering] - Get him, Jimmy Joe! Get him! [chair clattering] [punch thudding] - Come on, boys, get up, he ain't hurt. Get up, he ain't hurt. [punch thudding] - Oh, no, hold it, boy. It's not you I want, it's your pa! [Gatlin boy grunting] [punch thudding] [Lem laughing] [punch thudding] - Hit him again! [crowd shouting] - That ain't bad for a preacher man. - I'm no preacher, haven't you heard? [punch thudding] [piano keys banging] [crowd shouting] [piano rumbling] [glass shattering] - Come on, Pa! Get him! [boys cheering] [wood clattering] [upbeat jazz music] [punches thudding] [people shouting] [punch thudding] [wood banging] [glass shattering] [glass shattering] [punches thudding] [crowd shouting] [punch thudding] [crowd cheering] - Come on, Lem, eat him alive! You got him right where you want! - Doing fine, Lem. [punch thudding] [bells ringing] [punches thudding] - Get off! - Watch it now. I got him. [heads thudding] [crowd shouting] [punches thudding] [punch thudding] [door clattering] [crowd cheering] Let's go home. [people muttering] [leaves crunching] - Glad you felt up for taking a walk. It's a real pretty day. - [Becky] Mm-hmm. - You're looking pretty too. - Do I still look pretty to you? - You look beautiful. You'll always look beautiful to me. [somber piano music] Becky, it's an unfortunate thing what happened but it didn't just happen to you alone. It happened to both of us. - Tommy, it felt so awful, I'm so ashamed. - Becky, we're gonna get married. Nothing's changed. I'm still who I am and you're still who you are and I love you, Becky. More everyday. - I love you too. [pleasant music] - [Tommy] It's all right now. It's all right. - You want to enlist, don't you? - Yes. Because I have so much here to stand up for and to protect. And I feel I ought to. But, Becky, you, you're the most important thing in the world to me, so if you need me here. - I want you to do what you have to do. You go on. I'll be here and I'll make us a home worth fighting for. And after you get back from basic, then we'll get married. [pleasant music] - I'll have leave in a few weeks. - [Becky] Okay. - And I can wear my uniform when we get married. - [Becky] Okay. [Becky laughing] - [Tommy] We may not have much of a honeymoon. I might have to leave right after the wedding. - [Matthew] Emma! - Out here! Did you hear anything about the jury? - Sure did. Will be a long time before this town has to worry about the Gatlin boys again. - Ah. - Only took 30 minutes to convict all three of them. - Oh, I wonder if Becky knows. - Yeah, I went by and told her on the way over here. She looks good, Emma. She's got fire in her eyes again. You know, she says Tommy writes her regularly from bootcamp. - Oh, I'm glad that's behind us. How're you feeling? - I'm okay. Feel a little awkward sometimes, you know, without my ministering. I did it for so long. But I'm okay. [child laughing] - You look beautiful. - Were you this nervous on your wedding day? - Oh, yes. Every bride is. - I feel so grown up, like a woman. - I always kinda hoped that you and Tommy would get together. I'm so happy to have you as a daughter. - Oh, thank you. - Careful now. - [Becky] Oh, sorry. - Your mama and I are just about to be seated but I just had to take a look at you before your daddy came in. - Is Tommy here yet? - Don't worry, Matthew's gonna pick him up just as soon as the bus gets in. - I'm so glad they let us get married before he ships out. - A few hours isn't much time for a bride and groom. - I know. But it's enough for now. - I better get out there. Good luck. - Thank you. [pleasant organ music] [crowd cheering] - Thanks for coming. Mr. Wagner. - Good luck to you. - Beautiful! - Take care of her. - I will. I'll take care of her even better. [engine rumbling] [horn honking] Mama. Take care of yourself, I'll be back. [Emma mumbling] Okay, okay. I love you, Becky. - [Emma] Aw! [crowd clapping] - I'll write you all the time. - I'm proud of you, Tommy. - Thank you, sir. Take care of Becky for me. - Of course I will. It's the least I can do. I haven't been much of an uncle to you. - No, sir, you haven't. You've been more like a father. - Thank you. - I love you, Becky. [crowd cheering] [engine rumbling] - Give 'em hell, son. [Emma whispering] - Matthew, the deacons say that the church just isn't the same without you. - Thank you. Thank you.
