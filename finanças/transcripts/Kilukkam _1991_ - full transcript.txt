Oh! - Tea.. - Coffee.. Tea.. - Take this bag as well. Welcome.. Your dream in mist. Honeymoon cottages, five-star and three-star accommodation. Rooms available at cheap rates. Tea.. - Dormitories for Rs. 20 per bed. Welcome.. Mr. Mishra, don't shout. Porter.. Porter, coolie.. Guide.. Porter. Welcome.. Your dream in mist. Greetings, sir. Go and find Inspector Jayan. I'll finish that job today. Yes, sir. Your father, Judy, made me a horse betting fanatic. He was a wonderful jockey. I have not seen my dad. - I know that. Your mom was from the Odikkumad family. Mr. Achu was your grandfather. Somehow he ended up here in Mettupalayam to manage the accounts of the Englishman. Sir, the past is the past. Sir, you should be concerned about me. I need a job. I'm retired now. I can't find a job for you. Can you cook? Can you look after the house? I won't let Judy's son do such odd jobs. Let me see. I'll try talking to someone. Okay, sir. We will meet tomorrow morning. Thank God! He's not coming this way. I'll teach him.. Look at him coming. Why did you bring him this way? - My job is to be with him. He walked this way. So did I. Hey, Joji. Hey.. Did you say anything about me? - What should I say about you? I did say something.. What did you say? - It was not about you. So, you didn't say anything. Thank God! He is after me for the last two years. - Why? Even though he is retired, he won't leave me. - Did you take his photo? Yes, I did. - What happened? There was no film in the camera. Give me a drink. It's over. He finished it. We don't have his photo. We must take a copy of it. It's an absolute disgrace not to have our father's photo. For whom? - The neighbours. So you are concerned about them. You don't have any issues. It's not like that.. I have not kept this photo here to please people. If it was not for this great man Justice Pillai would have been nothing today. I have read the notes. The prosecution is weak. They have presented the case beyond a doubt. It's a case deserving life imprisonment. If they appeal, the case will be dismissed. Seven years of imprisonment can be given. Did you eat anything? - No. Kittunni, haven't you finished cleaning? No, I will teach all of you a lesson! Have you finished washing clothes? - Yes. I will teach him a lesson one day! Did you iron my clothes? - Yes. My God! This old man is such a nuisance. Come here. - I'm coming, sir. Did you change the bed covers? - Yes. Does he have the problem of peeing in bed? Idiot! Do your work diligently. - Yes, sir. He shouts as if he does all the work! Bring the plates. - Is he going to beg? I'm coming. I can't hear you from there. So.. Have you been calling me for a long time? Damn! Oh, were you here? I just saw her. Why are you gasping like a dog? - I was busy with the chores. What's this? - That's a plate. Is there anything to eat? Give me two hours. I'll prepare something. - What? Just give me two hours. I shall prepare something. Wait! - Yes. Go out and buy something. How can we wait for two hours? Idiot. No one dared to arrest me till date. You are the first one to commit this mistake! When I was jailed I had told you that I would take revenge on you! I'm not afraid of you. Let me see what you can do. I have come out of jail for the same reason! Scoundrel! Imbecile! How dare he arrest and handcuff me? He jailed me. I chopped both his hands off. Now he will beg on the streets. Hello.. - Oh! Joji. It's like.. It is like? Let me know when you retire. What a job! Joji, please ask someone from S. B Sounds to come. The assembly mike is not working. - Okay. You must take your medicines regularly. Don't lift any heavyweights. Be careful about your back pain. I'll leave now. Did you ask the manager to give you the estate account details? Yes. - Why? I'll check the accounts starting this month. - Don't you trust us? You and your brother-in-law have mismanaged the estate. Last month, both of you spent around Rs. 24,000. He was very upset. He shared his grief with me yesterday. Did he tell you? Are you God to listen to his grief? Listen, if you say such things to brother-in-law your disabled daughter would be back home forever. Let her come. She is my daughter. I will take good care of her. I have adequately compensated him for her shortcoming. Both of you are trying to take advantage of her. That's their problem. What about my issue? - What issue? Give me my share of the property, I'll take care of it. What if you don't have any? - What? Stay at the estate and take care of it. Then you'll get a salary. Or else, come and stay here. I'll look after the estate. - Okay. He is my son. He's well-mannered, isn't he? The present generation is like this, sir. I called you to pay the electricity bill. If I send him, I'd have to starve for the next three days. Let me tell you something. You have built such a big house. I find it difficult to manage the household chores. If you do not keep a cook here, I'll be a dead man! Oh! Joji.. - Yes. ...find someone for his funeral. - What? No, I mean a cook. I will bring the bill and money. He did not become this way for no reason. Did you see his son? His wife is no less than her son. She plays cards at the club and gossips about other men. She is pompous and wears sleeveless blouses. She'll never get into the kitchen. It has been 20 years since he settled here after a tiff with his family. I have stood by him. He vents his frustrations on me. That is my fate. Hey, what are you.. - Can't you keep quiet? So you are also with him. I shall not spare you.. What is this? Is it a firefly? There's hardly any light here. Can't you adjust the wicks on the lamp? Where's the kerosene? I am here to buy everything and you finish them. Get some water and a glass. I have gas trouble. Why did you get two glasses? - Why? Are you not drinking? Only I am going to drink. Once I am drunk, you can have the rest. You don't have to show mercy. You can have my share as well. Hey, idiot. When two people share a room one may fall short of some money. I can adjust to a certain extent but no one would like to stay with a penniless person like you. Hey, whose house is this? This house belongs to Late Bhoothalingam of Coonoor. Now it's in Karuppaiah's custody. I buy him alcohol and stay in this house without paying any rent. Now you have joined me as my roommate. Listen! I'll make it big someday. You have been telling this for a while now. You moron! If you plan to become rich by saving your life will be useless. That's why I save all my earnings and gamble on horse racing. If I win, it's a jackpot. Otherwise, it's a gamble. You just wait and watch. At least for one day before I die I will live like a king in Ooty. This is Nischal. Stills photographer of India. 'KILUKKAM' Coolie. Yes, ma'am. Can I help you? - Here. - Oh, sure. 'If I impress her, I'll get Rs. 100.' Ma'am, are you from Kashmir? - No. Okay, so you are a Malayali. You must be from Kochi or Thripunithura. Only women from royalty would have such good complexions. You are a princess, aren't you? I shall not ask you anything if you don't wish to answer. Ma'am, there are a lot of places here to visit. I'm a porter-cum-guide. Pushpa! - Yes, sir. Haven't you loaded the flower baskets yet? - Ma'am. Please come. - I did, sir! - Antony! Start the vehicle. - Hey, auto. Ma'am, please get in. This is a good customer. Don't make a scene for money. I'll sort that out for you. Let's go. This is the best hotel in Ooty. Narayanankutty. Na.. Ma'am, he is Narayanankutty. He is my friend. She is Princess Nandini. She hails from the Thripunithura royal family. She owns three to four hotels like this. Your keys, sir. Yes, ma'am? How can I help you? I want a room. I want the biggest suite. There are no suites available now. - Narayanankutty, don't say that. I requested her to come. Please don't insult me. Please. They will vacate the room in 15 minutes. They have gone out. They told us that they'd check out in the evening. Ma'am, please wait in the lounge. I'll inform you when the room is ready. - That would do. Wouldn't that be enough? Yes. Ma'am, please take a seat. It's tough to get a room here. Ma'am, you'll like this place. All facilities. Health club, swimming pool, vegetarian and non-vegetarian. Wonderful restaurants and 24 hours service. He cancelled the booking to allot us a room. He is a decent guy. Mr. Narayanankutty is a gentleman. Ma'am, I think you are lost in your thoughts. You don't need my assistance. You will get your room immediately. This is my job and my source of income. This is how I make a living. So, if you could give me something.. This much money.. - Isn't that enough? Yes, that's enough. I shall come tomorrow as well if you wish. Narayanankutty, please give her the room. Mr. Potty, I owe you Rs. 82. Take Rs. 100. Shall I give the change? - Keep the change. I think he has got a good deal today. Hey, catch. Open your mouth and gulp it down. This is chapatti and chicken fry. Eat your fill. Let your hunger go away. Where did you get the military liquor from? What do you mean? I bought it with my money. I am not a miser like you who do not spend money. This is a 100 rupee note. Have you seen this before? Did you rob that? - That's your father's job! Where else would you get so much money? Have you heard of luck? - No. Such a thing exists and it's in my horoscope. My luck has changed since this morning. A princess came with that luck to me today morning at Ooty railway station. Who's she? Tell me. She is so beautiful. Her eyes are.. Here. Hold it. Her eyes are like diamonds. Her nose is beyond description. Doesn't she have a nose? - Yes, she does. But not a flat nose like yours. Her face and nose are rosy red like apples! I thought she was a foreigner. Her attire was awesome. Her English is fluent. Enough of your description. No, you must listen. She was impressed with my style and asked me if I would like to have a nice time with her and enjoy before we came back. - Stop.. What does that mean? - I meant.. Oh! I forgot that you don't know English like me. You know only two lines. 'Welcome to Ooty' and 'Nice to meet you'. That knowledge is enough. I have managed to take care of a glutton like you with it. What if I don't need any more favours from you? She addressed me as handsome! She said that she would take me with her. She meant that she wanted to adopt a charming guy like me. I agreed to it. She gave me Rs. 1,000 and said goodbye, goodnight see you tomorrow and sweet dreams. That's how it went. - Hey.. Where does she stay? - What? Where does she stay? - She stays at Hotel Royal Tower. Princess Nandini is resting in her royal suite. We're meeting tomorrow morning. I want to take a few photos of her. You must introduce me to her. Don't even.. I won't do that because you are a scoundrel. You don't have the status to meet her. You are cheap. I'll do a favour in the memory of our friendship. - Okay. We'll probably go to Singapore next week. Where to? - Singapore. While we are leading a flamboyant lifestyle you'd be roaming around these streets photographing tourists to make a living. Showing sympathy to you I shall send you some dollars occasionally. I mean, Singapore dollars in a money order. How? In a money order. Now, you can gorge on this as a treat on my good fortune. Sir. - Yes. What's it, Antony? - You're wanted at the hotel. - Oh. Buddy, let me go to the hotel. She might need my assistance. I may not come tonight. I might have dinner with her and sleep there itself. Please don't misunderstand me, okay? If someone asks for me, don't say that I'm at Hotel Royal Tower. It may be a disturbance for her. Okay, bye, see you. You are responsible for all this! What's the matter? - Are you blind? Can't you see? You brought her here. Princess! There she is. Ask her. What happened? He promised to give me a room and is now backing out. If you are unable to give the room, please don't make a person wait. Didn't you promise me to give her a room? This is not a shelter home to give a room for free. Who says she doesn't have money? - Ask her. Did you tell them that you have no money? - No, not at all. This is not fair. Don't lie. I know she won't say that. You just ask her what she said. - What did you say? I said that my uncle was the Prime Minister of Angamaly and he would send the money if they call him. Didn't she tell you that her uncle would send the money? Can't you call up Angamaly.. Who is your uncle at Angamaly? Prime Minister! This donkey told me that this hotel doesn't belong to my uncle. Then I asked him if this hotel belongs to his uncle. He hurled abuses at me. I abused him back. One guy came to hit me and I poked him with my umbrella. When they pulled my umbrella, I broke the portrait hung there. When another guy tried to hold me, I hit him with the phone. Some other guy said that the hotel belonged to him. I abused him a lot. When he told that he would inform the police I hit him with the flower pot on his head. He was taken to the hospital. I didn't do anything else. They are shouting for such a trivial issue. Are you mad? Many people ask me the same. Why is that? Narayanankutty, what should I do? I have not called the police since I know you. She has done damage worth around Rs. 500. If you give the money, we will settle the matter. Do you have any money with you? I gave you everything that I had. I have 50 paise. Ask him to give me the room. Narayanankutty.. She is mad. Take her away before she creates a scene. Narayanankutty, I.. Will you take her away or should I call the police? Don't call the police. This idiot has come to Ooty with just Rs. 500. I thought she is from a royal family. The Princess of Thripunithura! Cars, bungalows, hotels and what not! I have never gotten into such trouble in my life. I didn't say anything. - Sorry. It was my mistake. This is the first time that a beggar has come in front of me in such attire! That's a parrot. - To hell with the parrot! I have seen many mad ladies. She is stylishly insane. My God! There is a squirrel over there. Please catch it for me. Not squirrel. I will get you the moon if you get out of my life. Return my money. I'll go back. If I had the money, I'd have given that and hit you as well. I'm hungry. Then look up and eat whatever you get. I thought you were rich when you gave that hefty tip. It's quite heavy. Do you have any stones inside? Do you have anything to pawn? I saw a mule when I got up in the morning. My situation is the same now. I can't carry it anymore! My God. What's this? Were you a street hawker? You damaged my stuff. Call someone else to carry this crap. Put them back. - Why do you.. I will hit you. You took my money, broke my suitcase and now are you shouting at me? Give me my money. I'll go back. Don't cry.. I'll put it back. Do not cry. She is truly insane. She has started harming me. I must be careful. "You are in front of my eyes and close to my heart." Is she the one? Hello, ma'am. Welcome to Ooty. Nice to meet you. Don't you dare touch me! Donkey! What is this? Is she mad? Yes. - What? Then what were you talking about the Princess of Thripunithura? Come with me. - Oh, God! I told you the truth. She is mad. - My God. I think she got out from a mental asylum. If you lend me Rs. 500, I will drop her somewhere far away. You deserve it. You were showing off. What did you say? You will send me money orders from Singapore! When you do, send Rs. 500 less. I won't give you a penny to help a mad girl. Please don't ditch me. - I can't help you. I have no sympathy for you! You were so bossy that day. That's your good fortune. Enjoy. - Then do this. Let her stay here for one night. She might kill me with a dagger. I'm already repenting for allowing you to stay with me. I can't tolerate this nuisance.. - What do I do then? Throw her somewhere. - Is she an animal to throw? You must let her stay here tonight. I will do something about it tomorrow. Hey. - Yes? Okay. Hey, be careful. Stay away from her. I'm hungry. Sit here. I'll get food for you. Bring it fast. Otherwise, she won't spare your pigeons. I want two ice-creams. - Is that enough in this weather? What else would you get here? - Well you get elephant eggs. Do you want that? No, I don't want that. Buy some plaster too. I want to seal her mouth. She is so irritating. Get some medicines for my toothache also. Hey, monkey. - Leave my Dhoti. He is the monkey. Come here.. - Will she come in? - Get lost. Where are we going? - We.. Have you seen hell? - Yes, I have heard of it. People are fried in oil and given a bath in ice water. - Yes. I don't want to go there. Where will we go now? Let's go to heaven. I have heard that it's very beautiful with many heavenly beings. It would be awesome. Where did he go? Hey.. Hey.. Hi.. Hi.. Oh, my God! Doesn't it feel nice to run early in the morning? I didn't find much joy in that. Were you in a circus before? - No. Why didn't you join? You have good stamina. For how long have you been doing this? What? - Globetrotting. Don't you have relatives back home? Where will we go now? - Now, we shall.. I will take you to a place. Oh, my God! There is no temple to pray. There are no temples. Who needs deities in temples? They only hear prayers of temple priests. If they get paid well, they will praise God! Gods get pleased when they hear praises! They're Gods, after all. Gods showers all their blessings to these idiots. They sell these blessings in lots at the black market. You won't find any middlemen here. You can say your grievances and seek blessings. There are no coupons or money. Come with me. I'll show you. Let us stand here and pray. What are you going to pray? - I shall pray to God to take me. I'm fed up. Then.. - Then nothing. I have come here to take a decision. God is the last resort! How do we pray? - Pray? You must look there and close your eyes. Okay. Don't open it for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes you would hear a voice asking you to open your eyes. Then open your eyes. You will find a light in the sky. I know Jyothi. She was my schoolmate. She was your schoolmate. This is the light appearing in the sky. Haven't you heard of 'Makarajyothi' at Sabarimala? Fire! What should we do after that? You can ask for blessings to that light. If you wish, this highland would turn into a garden of roses. If you wish for oranges, there will be oranges. Ice cream? - Yes, sure. Chocolate ice cream? - Yes, but you must pray earnestly. You must look in that direction. Don't avert your eyes. You must make your wish once you see the light. When you wish for money talk about me as well. - Yes. - Don't be in a hurry. Did you understand? Look over there. Keep your umbrella aside. Did you close your eyes? - Yes. Don't open your eyes. - No. - Don't peek. Pray now. - Okay. You will be able to see it now. The light will come now. Do not open your eyes. - Okay. Please appear soon. Please come soon. I ditched her.. Oh, God! - Where did you leave her? I left her at the top of Mukurthi cliffs and ran back. - Oh! Sinner! That place is filled with wild animals. There won't be anything left of her. Don't be sentimental now. I left her there because of you. I'll bash you up if you pity her. I had my wall to the back. - It's 'back to the wall'. It all means the same. Get me a drink. I'm going to sleep. Have you stored some liquor here? Where's the liquor bottle I bought the other day? - That.. I couldn't tolerate her and I finished it. Did you finish it? - Yes. Let her go to hell! I can eat with peace of mind now. Don't touch that drink. Hey! - I don't trust you. Damn! She used to eat everything I bought for us. She was always hungry and wanting food. Beggar! Oh, my God! It's the dress I have dry cleaned for tomorrow. There are six Parathas here. Two Parathas are for you and four for me. This is chicken curry. The chops for you and half the gravy for me, right? Gravy is enough for you. - Once a miser, always a miser. Beggars will always remain beggars. God is with me. What did you tell me when you had gone for dinner? Please don't misunderstand me. Isn't that right, scoundrel? It might be Mr. Muniswamy. Please give him the photo. That's not his photo. - Is it? This is it. - It's a colour photo! Give it. Neither was there a fire nor light. In fact, I saw nothing. I found my way back with great difficulty. As I was running, I saw an elephant. But I escaped. - How? The elephant would have run away after seeing her. I'm feeling hungry. I'm feeling hungry. Have you decided not to let me live? Right? - Hey, keep it back. That was my dry cleaned shirt! Nischal, don't get agitated. I may go mad any time. I won't get agitated. But I want to know your decision. You have suffered a lot. Just bear it for one more night. I'm unable to think straight now. We'll do something in the morning. What will you do? If nothing else works, I'll strangle her and go to jail. Do as you wish. If we take out the dinner now, she will eat everything. If that's the problem, let's wait until she falls asleep. Yes, it's a problem. Monkey. Hey, monkey. I can smell chicken. I saw a chicken somewhere in the fields. No. I can smell chicken curry. That might be a chicken which ran away while being cooked. Go and sleep. - Please. She has slept. Let's have dinner. - Okay. Come with me. - Okay. It is very spicy. Come here. There is some food left. Do you want it, monkey? I know what her problem is. She's gone mad due to gluttony. I had told you that I could smell chicken curry. This monkey always lies. You devil! I'm a chimpanzee and not a monkey. Do you know what they do? They bite, scratch and hurt. Leave me. I'm hungry! I shall buy you Paratha and chicken. Where the hell would you get Paratha and chicken at midnight? I'll die of starvation tonight. If so, feed her my corpse. This glutton would eat that too. Take her and go away right now. Where do we go on this chilly night? I don't care! Just listen to me. - Don't say anything. You're not staying with me anymore. Just listen to me. - Don't say a word. Will you leave or should I? - Damn! Did you see that? - Yes. Then what are you looking at? Please leave now. Get out. - What? - Get out. - What? Get out! Get lost. Get lost. Chicken thief! Oh! Please take away this devil! - Come here! Get lost! - Move! Don't put me in a mess. Show some mercy. If I roam around with a girl at midnight people would misunderstand me. All I have left is my self-respect. Don't make me lose that. I'm begging you. That's fine but massage my legs properly. My legs are aching. I shall pull your legs and.. - Hey! I'll be hurt. No matter what happens I'm sending you back on this train tomorrow. If you try to get down, I'll commit suicide on the tracks. I must find a solution for it! Either you or me. I promise that I would take a decision. I hope they are here. One is here. Thank God! The girl is also there. Buddy.. Buddy. - Shut up. Just listen to me. - Get lost. - Buddy. Buddy.. - Don't touch me. I blabbered something yesterday because of hunger. - Something? Please forgive me. Fights are routine among friends. Hey.. Okay, then. Give me Rs. 50. - What for? I shall go to Gokarna or Coimbatore and do odd jobs. Don't say such harsh words. - We can get rid of this girl. Don't get upset. We shall find a way for everything. - Speak softly. She will wake up. I must leave before that. You keep quiet. Didn't she wake up? - No. - Dear Nandini.. - Hey.. What are you up to? - Nandi. - Oh! Dear, are you asleep? My princess. I'm hungry. - The glutton has started whining. Come out. - Wait.. Poor girl. Dear.. She is like our own. Come here. What's wrong with you? - Come here. I'm hungry. Do you know me? You are a monkey! - This monkey will buy you Appam, eggs, Paratha, chicken curry Idli, Sambar, Dosa and curry. Oh! - What are your intentions? You just come with me. - Dear, come with me. Come along. Come on. Here's your breakfast. Idli, Bhaji and Sambar. You can eat anything in this shop. Go on, eat! Hey, it's my breakfast. Oh! Here. Why are you creating a scene just because this little child touched your food? I shall buy you more. What happened? - Nothing. Come with me. What about her? - She will sit there and eat. Come.. This is a newspaper wrapping I got yesterday. Here. '20-year-old young girl is missing.' Gosh! I-Isn't this her picture? - Yes. She escaped from a mental hospital. We will get Rs. 15,000 if we help find her. This newspaper is ten days old. Here. This newspaper is three days old. They have increased the reward to Rs. 25,000. I conducted a thorough research on this matter. Shall we hand her over now? She is our golden goose! Don't kill it. What do you mean? - I mean that we must keep her in our custody for ten more days. The bounty will definitely go up. We will get double of what they are offering now. How can we bear her expenses for another ten days? I'll take care of that. Don't worry. - Talk sense. We must get it done somehow. If we struggle a bit right now, all our miseries would vanish forever. Look, she's the Goddess of wealth. Don't push her away. Damn. - Please, Joji. Shake hands. Shake hands with me. Really? - Yes. - Really? - Yes. This is absolutely her. - Yes. "Let us nurture our life in Ooty town." "Let us build a beautiful castle here, but keep quiet as of now." "In this horse race" "there's no one to compete with us." "We would hit the jackpot" "and buy the whole town of Ooty." "Let us nurture our life in Ooty town." "Let us build a beautiful castle here, but keep quiet as of now." "We shall bid adieu to photography." "Why not own Photo town itself?" "We shall shoot many movies and you will be the superhero." "Then money would multiply. - Yes, definitely." "I'll go around the world. - Yes!" "That's a good idea." "In fact, it's a great idea." "Hey idiot, today we are here on the highland." "Tomorrow we'd be on foreign shores. - Yes!" "We must travel in a foreign car with a bunch of notes." "We must spend lavishly and drive the car at insane speed." "I think the tyre condition is not good." "Apply the brakes." "There seems to be a puncture. - That's dangerous." "This is the best chance of our life. Don't let go of it." "Let us nurture our life in Ooty town." "Let us build a beautiful castle here, but keep quiet as of now." "We shall have everything in life! TV, AC and everything in Ooty." "Let's convert the notes to votes. I shall be the PM and you the CM." "Oh!" "Don't scare us." "We shall overcome all hurdles." "We need not beg. We can amass" "a lot of money. We must rule forever." "That's right as per the law. This is just the beginning." "Let us nurture our life in Ooty town." "Let us build a beautiful castle here, but keep quiet as of now." "In this horse race, there's no one to compete with us." "We will beat everyone." "We would hit the jackpot" "and buy the whole town of Ooty." "We must travel in a foreign car with a bunch of notes." "We must spend lavishly and drive the car at insane speed." Hey.. Who is the girl staying with you? Which girl? - What? Who is that rich girl staying with you? She is not rich. She is very poor. She is mad too. Let me go now. - Hey.. I know everything. It's not what you think. She isn't well. I bought medicines for her. Don't lie! You swine! - I'm telling the truth. I'm not lying. She is really mad. Hold me.. - What are you up to? I think the news has spread. What happened? Street rogues have started questioning me. They must have found out from you. You must have told everyone about the money. No, it's not that. You must stay at home with this mad girl. Don't take her out for fishing and bird watching. I'm saying the same thing. Didn't I tell you to fix the deal? Idiot, we can't recover her expenses if we let go of her now. Let this drama continue for a few more days. I have spent Rs. 460 for her today. It's my hard-earned money. Listen to me. I have found a suitable hideout. You must move there with her. - Where is it? The place where the washermen wash clothes. The Dhobi Ghat. There is a vacant house there. There are a few idiots staying nearby. The washermen would go in the morning. They don't read newspapers. You can stay with her for 10-20 days. No one will recognise you there. The reward would increase by the day. We can fix the deal as well. I'll hit you. - No, don't hit me. Do you want me to go around with this crazy girl for 10-20 days while you enjoy life here? Anyway, you have no job as such. You won't be able to hold the old man's coffee flask for some days. That's a small loss. He need not drink coffee for a few days. Hey, do some job that fetches you money. Listen to me. You need not say any anything. I'll tell you. Come here. Hey, that's enough. Let's go. Hey, girl. - It's me. What were you about to tell me? - We must change her appearance. Even her father must be unable to recognise her. How do we do that? Let's behead her. - Don't make fun of me. Don't do it when I'm talking seriously. Listen, people might recognise her. Her photo is published in the papers almost every day. That's why I asked you to change her look. Then tell me in a way I can understand. Let's do one thing. Come. Let's crop her hair until here. Then we shall make her wear spectacles. What do you say? That's fine. Shall I suggest something? Let's give her a moustache as well. People might recognise her? - No. It will be nice. Then, not just a moustache let us make her wear a beard, a turban and make her a Sardar. How would that be? - That would be nice. I have not seen a moron like you before. Moustache, my foot! Don't mess up everything! Call someone to cut her hair. Bring a mirror too. Go. I'll cut her hair. - That's the perfect job for you. Let's get this done by someone who knows it. Just go! Monkey got scared! I promise that I will hand her over only after I slap her. Where's monkey going? He has gone to call someone. - Who? An uncle. - Uncle! That's nice. Stop there. Don't run. Don't touch me. - Get hold of her. Oh, no.. Hold her. - Cut her hair. Oh, my God! She's biting me! Oh! I need something like this one. My God! Hey, run. Stop there. Oh! Please don't hurt me. Okay. Stop. You need not cut your hair. I'll cut your hair today. Leave me. Hold her.. Yes. Looks fine! Lollipop. Ice-cream. - Ice-cream. Oh! - Come. Hold it. Give me the monkey. - Only I'm left. Okay, this one. Here. - Hey, come here. I have arranged everything for you. My total expense was Rs. 750.60. The rent is separate. All the groceries are.. Let that be. Come here. What happened? - Actually.. I will be staying here with this mad girl for a few days, right? Yes. How do you wish to proceed with the deal? Do we need to have accounts between us? Yes, we do. If we don't finalise things now, we will fight later. Don't you trust me? - No. You are the only one whom I don't believe. You are like a chameleon. No one can guess when you would change. Okay, Then it's a deal. - Tell me the deal first. You must make it clear what my share is and what is yours. Suppose we get Rs. 1 lakh, how much do we both get? If it's Rs. 1 lakh, you can take Rs. 40,000 I need only Rs. 60,000! Okay, that's fine. But you must stay here with her. - Jeez! I can't do that. - So you can't do that! I'm risking my life staying with this girl. I shall take 60 percent and you can take 40 percent of the money. That's because I'll have to suffer her. I maintain my body with great difficulty. Leave that topic. I'm the one spending money on her. What about that? You can keep that account separately. I need 60 percent of the money and you can have 40 percent. Do you accept my deal? Otherwise, I'm backing off. Hey, don't be so hard-hearted. I have hardships too. Okay, then add Rs. 10,000 more. - No. Rs. 5000? - No. Okay. Rs. 1000. - Keep quiet. Okay, Rs. 500. - No. At least Rs. 200.. Rs. 100.. At least give me Rs. 10 more. Don't be so greedy. Take your share and eat it. Monkey.. - What? - Little monkey. What's this? That's powder. - No, it's a phone. Okay, I agree. Can't you make out a phone? What's this? - It's firewood. No, it's a spear. - So be it. What's this? - Keep it there. It's a mouth organ. Keep it there. What's this? - Your father! Is that so? I thought it's this one. Come fast. There are so many flowers up there. They are so beautiful. You are spoiling the kids as well. You troubled me there and so I brought you here. But here too.. This is for my Joji. You look so good now. "Johnny, Johnny. Yes, Papa." - Don't cry. You can say that you were late because the horse's leg slipped. "Eating sugar. No, Papa." "Telling lies. No, Papa." - Come. - "Telling lies. No, Papa." "Open your mouth. Ha ha ha." Why are you late? - "Open your mouth. Ha ha ha." "Johnny, Johnny. Yes, Papa." - Why are you crying? "Johnny, Johnny. Yes, Papa." - Why are you late? - "Yes, Papa". "Eating sugar. No, Papa." - Show me your hand. You! How dare you beat her? Poor girl. You! Stop! Stop it. Stop! How dare you misbehave? Don't you know that this is a school? Where did you get her? You will spoil the kids as well. If she comes again, I will call the police. Hey.. - Don't talk. I'll kill you! Go to your classes. - Silence. Silence, please. - I don't like you. You are not handsome. Today, I won't spare you. I had a permanent job. I lost that too. I'll slap you. How dare.. - My God! Who are you to push me? - I'll chop your limbs and throw them away. Do you think that I would let you do that? I should be slapped for taking you to school. Oh, no! You! I don't need any of your things here. My clothes and doll.. - Take them and go away from here. Get lost! Your bloody clothes. Your dirty stuff. You.. You hit me. You took money from me and hit me. I'm going. I'll tell everyone. I'll tell them that you took money from me and then beat me. Go and tell them. Let us see what happens. Get out.. I'll not go until you give me my money. I'll not give you any money. Go and file a case against me. Hey, open the door. - Get lost. Open the door. Open the door. Get lost, donkey. Laxman, take all the newspapers that have come today. It's over there. - Give it to me. Here is the money. What would happen if you don't read the newspaper? Have you stopped taking photos and started selling groundnuts? Yes, do you need some? Mind your own business. Who does he think of himself? - Nuisance! Nandini. Nandini. Nandini. Nandini.. Nischal.. - What? He might be calling me for money. Hey, did you see her? - Whom? That mad girl is missing. Oh, God. Damn! Do you know where she has gone? Why would I ask you if I knew? - Where were you at that time? I must be blamed for giving you this responsibility. Would she have committed suicide? - Hey.. Why don't you look in the trench? - Don't talk such things. God, we must be able to find her. We could give her corpse at least and get the money even if it's a small amount. Stop murmuring and search for her at the junction and park. I'll search for her at the suicide point and lakeside. Go! God! Let her be safe! I made a mistake. I hope she is alive somewhere. Hey.. Don't cry. I'm here. Hey. You were hiding here and you made me run around Ooty! So you like me. Yes, I like you so much. Then bring the ladder. I'll come down. How did you climb up there? I used the ladder to climb to the ceiling. After that, the ladder fell down. Go and bring it. I've heard of human monkeys. Now I saw it. I can't take the ladder. Just jump. I will catch you. - Okay. Will you catch me? - Yes, sure. Just jump. Do you promise? - Definitely. I will catch you. You are my darling! Jump. Please jump. Oh, God! If I leave you inside, you will play with fire and kerosene. If I leave you outside, you will trouble others. If I take you with me, my job would be in peril. So, you can sit here and enjoy the nature and people around. This is the only way out. It's better that I tie you up rather than others doing it. You sit here. Okay. Hey, Muniswamy. The ox.. Run! Shankili's ox is on the loose! Oh, God! Hey, the ox is behind us! Run! Run.. - Oh, no! You must be tied to a pole and beaten up. - What happened? Are you a human being? Why did you tie that mad girl here? You're laughing? Shankili's ox almost killed her. When we saw her, she was being rammed. Her face was smeared with blood. She was tied up. She could only cry. You are heartless! No, lie down. Don't get up. Is the ox all right? Did the ox hurt you a lot? Poor thing. Everyone beat it badly. Did you eat anything? - No, I don't want to eat. I was trying to sleep. - Then sleep. What is it? It hurts. I'm not able to sleep. Try to sleep. You'll feel better. "The mind is like the pinwheel top" "that spins with thoughts." "Go to sleep, my darling." "Let the gentle moonlight caress your cheeks." "Feel the mist slowly." "The misty month of 'Medam' has engulfed the hill." "Sleep on the couch in the moonlit night." "Let your disturbed mind find solace." "Go to sleep, beautiful girl." "The stars are shining in the dark night." "The mind is like the pinwheel top" "that spins with thoughts." "Go to sleep, my darling." "Did the darkness of the new moon cocoon your eyes?" "Which fragrance of the flower" "did you take in your soul?" "Did your memories fade by itself?" "Was it the time that betrayed you or was it the witchcraft of life?" "You are the fading moonlight. Go to sleep." "Let the gentle moonlight caress your cheeks." "Feel the mist slowly." Hey, Muthu! I searched for you everywhere. Where were you? I had gone to vacate a house in the neighbourhood. You have time for all that. But you can't vacate the Dhobis from there. Your master, Khan.. He took Rs. 20,000 from me. He went to jail. My job is still unfinished. Don't get angry. I'll figure out a way. We won't vacate this place at any cost. We have no other place to stay. This land belongs to the judge. Let him come. If he tells us, we will vacate. - Yes. Otherwise, won't you vacate? Get lost, you scoundrel! We won't vacate. Hey, old woman.. - He is trying to kill me. Help! This man is trying to kill me. Oh, God! Leave me! Hey! Please get off me! I will chop you into pieces. The scoundrel is down and out. Hey, where is that girl? Mr. Muthu, I'm sorry. Forgive her. She is mad. I apologize on her behalf. Please forgive us. - Okay. I don't want to see that girl anywhere here. I will keep her locked inside the house. Please. Follow me. - Hey, scoundrel.. I'm talking to you. If I hit you, you will lose all your teeth. Catch her! You.. I'll.. I am not feeling good for the past few days. What happened now? Many kinds of nightmares. Thankam is getting more depressed every day for not being able to bear a child. All these might be the result of my sins. Did you come here to say this? If you get emotional, everyone will find out. Let everyone know. Do you have the courage to confess? Do you? No! Then don't open your mouth. Do not talk about this topic in the future. Joji.. What am I hearing? A dog is moaning. - Yes. If that Khan comes here you'll have to moan louder. Why did you hit that Muthu? They would have killed her if I had not hit them. You should have let her die! Don't think that you can let her live here, even if you get Rs. 10 lakhs. I'll write a letter.. No, I'll write a telegram.. No, I will call them. Or else, I will visit their place. Otherwise, I will ask them to come here. What will we do? We must know who they are. We must know why they need her. Why do you have to bother about that? Let us take the cash and leave this place. He will be out on bail anytime. He'll come here for sure. Who? - Samad Khan. Do not mess with his men again. We will look very ugly without arms or legs. We must plan something and leave this place immediately. Shall I send a telegram.. No.. Shall I? Tell me something. We will gain nothing and lose everything. Or else.. Do anything! What? Tell me what is in my hand. Phone. No, a powder tin. What about this? I know that this is not a mouth organ. It is a knife. Nandini.. Please forgive me. I am not mad. I was acting. Please don't let them take me. They.. They will kill me. Please, Joji. Please. I have never seen my mother. During childhood, I had fantasies about how my father would be. I was at the monastery since I could remember. The only things that reminded me of my father were the chocolate boxes and clothes that came regularly. All those were given to the hostel warden. But he never came to meet me. I hid and saw him one day. I used to call that man who sent me sweets as Sweetman. He later stopped coming. But the chocolate boxes came. Later, chocolates were replaced by money orders from various places. He advised me through the letters to study well and get a better life. I did not have an address to write back. I came to know that I was his illegitimate child. After that, I received a letter saying that he had deposited money in the bank in my name. Every month, the bank would send me the money for my needs. That was the last letter. I came here in search of my father who did not call me his daughter. He is here now. Who is he? - Retired Justice Pillai. When I joined the monastery I went to meet my father once. Father was not at home. Even though as a guest my father's family treated me well. Ruku told me that my father stayed separately from his family because of me. I do not know what happened after that. I was in a mental asylum when I regained consciousness. All of them were actually cheating me. I could not prove to anyone that I was not mad. Everyone was on their side. Who would rescue a person like me who had no one in her life? I thought my life would end in that room. But I got a chance to escape from there. My memory of a father is limited to the sweet boxes that he used to send. I want to see him, Joji. I need to talk to him. I need to hear him call me his daughter. That is my only wish. When I saw you, I thought that I could depend on you. That is why I pretended to be insane and stayed with you. Don't sacrifice anything for me. Let me see my father once. Then you can let them take me and collect the money. Joji, please. Please, Joji. Joji. Joji.. Joji! Come here. They called me. They are on their way. I have fixed the amount at Rs. 80,000. I will ask for Rs. 5,000 more when they come. But I have not told them the place. Once we get the money, we will enjoy! Both of us have won the jackpot together. She is not the person we assumed her to be. What do you mean? She is not mad. - What? She is an innocent girl. I was sure that there was something wrong. Otherwise, why would someone give so much money for a mad woman? Leave it. Let's just mind our own business. They will kill her if she goes with them. Let them do anything. Why should we bother? We must get our money. That's it! Don't include me in the money business. Why? Don't you need any money? I don't want any money by harming others. Oh! No problem. I'll take the full amount. Whatever, I'll not let go of Nandini. What did you just say? You would not let go? - Yes. She is not your property. You need not talk much. - I will! I entered this business to make five times my investment. I'll make that money somehow and I'll give it to you. Yeah, right! I don't need anything from you. - Then get lost. No, I won't. You fell in love with the girl whose expenses I bore. Have you started liking her? Is that why you are hesitant to let her go? What is your intention? Do you want to sing a duet with her or do you want to make money by selling her? Damn! What did you say? Don't talk nonsense. How dare you hit me! I will not spare you. Nandini. It is not safe to stay here anymore. He will not let this go. That is for sure. People may come at any point in time to take you from here. Let us go to Mr. Pillai's house. How can we go there all of a sudden? If you want to realise your wish you must first understand your father. You must understand his mind. He should get to know you too. Human affinity is more important than relationships. Also, the only place where no one will come searching for you is Mr. Pillai's house. It is best for you to go there. How can I get in there? There is a way. So, shall we go? Hey, Joji. I haven't seen you in a long time. In your absence, I miss the tea during the morning walk. I had gone to Balussery. Did you manage any deal? - Yes. Here is the deal. - Who is she? She is a distant relative of mine. She stayed with her mom. That lady died recently. I went to enquire when I heard about it. Now she's my responsibility. - I see. After the funeral, her relatives went on their way. When she asked for a job, I thought of bringing her here. What's her caste? Her mother's caste. I can see that on her face. But she looks a bit sneaky. That is because you are analysing her from a judge's point of view. She is innocent. - Okay. We cannot believe anyone these days. Will you stay here without creating any problems? Initially, they would listen to everything. Once they take charge, they will change. She won't create any trouble. Will you? The house must always be clean. There are other chores too. There is a jackass here. You must make him do his work. Where is Mr. Kittunni? - He has gone to buy lunch. He may come back by dinner time. Then, your.. I forgot his name. Nischala? - Nischal. Tell him not to come in front of me. What about her salary? - Give her anything you wish. Go inside. - Go. Joji, I hope she's not your girlfriend.. - No. I know that you are a judge. Have you told that to her? - Yes. Sir, I have a doubt in this calculation. Sir! This is Rs. 75,000. - Yes. This is Rs. 5,000. - Yes. Total of Rs. 80,000. I have just agreed to show you the person. - Yes. Your people must do the rest of the work. - Yes. Hey! Two of you go to the back. Fast. She might get out and run. Be careful. She is harmful. "Whatever Nischal does never goes wrong." Actually, this is not enough. - Okay, I'll give more. - Nice. She stays here, right? - Yes. Isn't she inside? - Come with me. I.. Come here. Come on! - Yes. - Quick. - Okay. Come! Did you come here to see if I am dead? I am not dead. I will die only after I get to know about her whereabouts. Please listen to me. - I do not want to listen. If you are planning to make money all for yourself before I get out of here that wish would remain a dream. Do not move your body too much. - There's nothing more to move. They've already done the damage. - Lie down. Just listen to me. - Do not touch me. Don't become emotional. - Yes, I will. Both of you spent my money all these days. Both of you roamed around spending my money. Finally, I was thrashed for your deceit. Do you still think that I cannot be emotional? I came to talk to you with all seriousness. I am so sorry for what has happened to you. I am so happy that you are so sorry. Do not expect any compromise. I am not ready for it! Just listen to me. - No. I don't want a compromise. Just listen to me. - No. Please. - No.. I wanted to say that a fool should not be advised. - Is that so? Yes, I came here to tell you that fact. Not to console you, idiot! - Get lost. - Goodbye. I will find her wherever you try to hide her. I did not understand anything. What is the issue between you both? Nothing! Get lost. Go out and read the paper. To hell with him. What is it? - Chicken curry. - Okay. What are you doing? - I thought I would greet it before I eat it. It's older than me! You are just wasting my money. Is there anything else left to eat? Give it here. It's fish curry. Will you get me a stick? - Yes. Why? - To kill the fish and eat it. You have put the fish as it is, sans any salt or even cooking it. I shall bring the salt in a bowl. - Okay, do one thing. Keep around 10-15 vessels on this table with different spices in it. I'll then serve myself. - I'll do that hereafter. Shut up. I am to be blamed for giving shelter to people like you. Can't you wash the plate? - I have done it. - In cold water? No, hot water. - W-Who asked you to wash them in hot water? Let me tell the truth. I washed the plates in cold water. What is it? I thought you might need my help. Haven't you kept your food inside? - Yes. Then, why do you stand here while I eat? Do you want me to get a stomach ache? My God! Rs. 400? Doctor, the bill is too much. The more the injuries, the greater will be your bill. Doctor, are you joking? - Get lost, fool. Take care of your hand. - Okay. Hey.. Greetings. Where is Joji? I fought with him. What? - I fought with him. Fight! - Do you want to fight with me? Yes. Are you mad? - No, I am Nischal. Actually Joji and I fought with each other. Enemy.. Are you my enemy? - Yes. Joji beat up my men. If I get him, I will kill him. Otherwise, I will kill you. Tell me! I know.. How can I explain to him in Hindi? I know.. - Then tell me. I know.. My God! Someone tell this man that I do not know anything. Tell me! Rs. 10 lakhs and a car! Whoever buys lottery from me will surely win. Do not talk much. Give me a ticket. - Is that so? You'll surely win this time. - Will you win this time at least? Do you want to get beaten by me? Sit there. Why are you sitting here like a fixed pole? Why the hell are you laughing? Useless fellow! Mister.. - Yes. Give me your ticket here. - Why? Give it here. Do you know about it? 'KL 720' '78431.' Almighty! Mister. - Yes. - You'll win this time for sure! I guarantee it. You must think of God before you buy tickets. Do you have a silver tongue? - Mine? - Yes. - Just see.. It looks like what you say will come true! How can I speak? As soon as my father gets up in the morning Mr. Kittunni follows him like a tail. There is a way out. Kittunni will go by himself. This is his lottery ticket number. He is illiterate. You must read the newspaper and convince him that he's won. He will leave immediately. Okay? - Okay. Mr. Kittunni. - Yes? - The lottery results. Lottery results. Oh! I forgot. Dear Sun God! Make my lottery ticket win at least this time. Okay, read it. - 'First prize' 'is Rs. 10 lakhs and an Ambassador car.' - I have heard this before. 'First prize, ticket number' 'K..' - Heard of K a lot. 'L..' - Okay. 'Seven.' - Seven. 'Two.' - Two. 'Zero.' - Zero. 'Seven.' - Seven. 'Eight.' - Eight. Is it correct, Mr. Kittunni? Yes. 'Four.' - Four. 'Three.' - Three. 'One.' - What did you say? One. - One? Yes. I won! Hey. Where are you looking? Are you acting crazy? I called you. Hey, no one becomes a foreigner just by wearing expensive clothes, smoking a cigar or driving a banged-up car. I will fix your waggon today! You idiot! You have been abusing me for a long time. I've heard it for all these days because I had no other choice. Any rich man can abuse a poor man. You have abused me for 35 years. I am now giving all that abuse back at you. Hey.. - Mind your words. I'll smash your face in! What did you think about me? Did you assume that I would serve you all my life? I'll teach you how to behave with servants. I am appointing a few servants in my house. Then I'll take you there. Look here. Here! You may be thinking that you were feeding a rattlesnake. Yes, you are right. I am a rattlesnake. You have given a death sentence to many people. Their curses will haunt you till you die. If I go away from here you will end up counting the stars and struggling each day. I'll come here in my own car to see that. I repeat, my own car. I am not being arrogant, you son of a bitch. Shut up, rascal. - Get lost, you di.. No.. Dumb-ass! Come here if you dare. Come.. I see.. Dumb-ass, I'll kill you. How do I start? Daddy? No. Father? No. Papa? No. Sweetman. Shall I call him by that name? Sir. - Please don't kill me. Where.. Where do I keep all these? Keep them on my head! You scared me! The milk.. Are you my wife to get me milk? Get lost! I thought I would keep these here before you sleep so that you are not disturbed. Then you must have kept it somewhere and gone away. Is this the time for sweet talk? Why do people write such scary stuff? Damn! I have been sitting here for a long time. Do you need a royal welcome for you to come? You must have done all these earlier. Is this glass so heavy? Is that why you did not bring it with the plate? Why can't you answer me? What is this? - Apple. I know that. Are you bringing the dishes one by one? Only this is there for lunch. Why? Didn't you cook food today? - No. Eat the apple and drink the water. If needed, I'll give two more. - Give it to your husband! I have not appointed you to act according to your convenience. What is such a Himalayan task at this house? A Himalayan task is better than this. - How dare you backchat! You have a problem when I do not speak and also when I speak. What kind of nuisance is this? You don't even let me do my work properly. Why can't you work properly, useless girl? Mind your words! Then I'll call you Queen Mary. You are not my daughter. You are the servant here. - I can do only one job at a time. Kittunni! He went away because he could not bear your tantrums. Wait there! I want to know why the food was not cooked today. When I went to cook rice, you asked me for hot water. But I took my bath in cold water. You asked me to heat oil when I went to fetch the hot water. Did you do that? You then asked me to go to the grocery store. Did you buy the grocery? No. You asked me to mop the house and then go. But even that is not done. That's when you asked me to serve food. I have washed some rice. I'll give you that. Go and tell that to your father. I am telling it to my father. What? I'll make lunch for you if you remain quiet for one hour. I don't need it. I will not die if I don't eat lunch for once. Where is the apple? Where is the apple? - I ate it. So, your needs are being satisfied fully. Go inside and get me something. Give me some apple. I am hungry. - I ate all of it. Who asked you to eat it? You will not die if you don't eat for once. Damn! We have not gotten any news about her. I had asked the Inspector General to take the matter seriously. We will get hold of her if she has not left this state. He has promised me. I just hope that she does not meet her father. This is wrong. He's her father too. Mother has kept father away from this house by abusing him. No one must blame mother for anything in this house. Get lost. What have you done here other than spending father's money? Your father was the judge. Go and preach to him. If I am spending his earnings, that's not for free. It's the cost of bearing the burden of a handicap like you. Do not talk nonsense. Our need is to get hold of her before she meets uncle. We should do that rather than blaming each other. If she meets uncle, things will go out of our control. People will support her if they get to know the truth. Yes. People love to insult rich people. Okay. Come with me. I was sleeping peacefully. Why are you troubling me? I thought this would get worn out if kept unused. Servants need not bother about that. There are many chores left to do. Why can't you do that? I have finished all the work. Why don't you wash all the bed sheets and pillows? That is the job of the washerman. - I have no money to give them. I am giving you three meals a day. Then why don't you do it? Go! Stop it. Idiot! Are you deliberately doing all this to trouble me? I will not let you stay here for a minute. Get out right now. I will not go out that easily. Oh, do you want provident fund and gratuity? - I don't. I'll go only with Joji. Is that so? - Yes, it is so. Then I shall bring him here right now. I will not let you stay here at any cost. The judge? Where is Joji? - We haven't seen him for two days. Tell that scoundrel to come to my house. Is there any problem? - He needs a tight slap from me. What is the issue? - I need to get a slap. Is that so? - Yes. Why is the old man searching for me? - No idea. Do not lie. He wanted to slap me. What happened? - We fought with each other. He is searching for you to send me back with you. Why did I leave you here? To fight with him or to sort everything out? What can I do? I tried every possible way. He is so arrogant. You are talking about your own father. Does that mean I must not complain? He creates some problem every day. He'll trouble me even if I'm sitting idle. Okay. I'll stay away for few days. You must reconcile within that time. He is innocent. He just pretends to be stern. Joji, do not worry. Nothing wrong will happen. Hey, who is this? What? Hey.. Where is my moustache? It is on your face. - I asked you where the rest is. I do not know. A cockroach might have nibbled it. I know the cockroach very well. You look good now. You looked like a wild boar with the pointed moustache. Now it is good. At this rate, you might chop my head off citing beauty issues. There's a limit to everything. I spare you because you are a woman. Otherwise, I would have.. I would have beaten you black and blue. I would chop and boil you on the stove. Then, I would pour kerosene on you and burn your body. I'll send you packing within 24 hours if I am alive. To hell with your cockroaches. Pull the brakes. The canal is close by. Your horse might turn that way. How much? - Rs. 20. Rs. 20? - Yes. - I don't need your horse cart. It was better to lie in the hospital. Heck! These birds have dirtied the premises. Hey, stop there. I will not stop. I can recognise you even without the moustache. I do not want you. - I know that you want the photo. No. Wait there. Let me tell you. I don't want to hear anything. - Where is Joji? So, did Joji sent you here? Isn't he happy yet? Would he be happy only after I die? Hey, there's a pit over there. - Pit.. No.. Hey.. What is it? Hot water for you to take a bath. - Keep it there. Keep it there! Do not touch it. Do not touch anything in this house. I understood everything. Joji is hiding from me. You will not get anything from this house till he comes. You will starve and turn mad. There is a limit to subduing someone. Oh! - Do not try to subdue me. Get lost. No one can rule me. What happened? - Do not touch me. Oh! Hey, lift me up. Can I touch you? - Yes. Oh! Where is it? What? - Car? I am hungry. I have not eaten anything for seven days. Where were your servants? Master, do not flog a dead horse. You did not call me master on that day. I might have called you sir or judge. Is that wrong? No. You had called me another name on the day you went to buy the car. Will you believe me if I tell you a truth? Yes, tell me. I do not remember that. I remember. You had called him dumb-ass. - Are you still not satisfied? She is the one responsible for everything. She lied to me that I won the lottery. She said that if I buy a house and car she would leave this useless job and work at my house. Look at her.. Hey, he is laughing! "My footwear is from Japan and the trousers from London." "My red hat is from Russia, yet my heart is Indian." "My footwear is from Japan and the trousers from London." "My red hat is from Russia.." Has he gone mad? No. He laughed loudly. He really did! Okay. Let me see if it's time to tell the truth. He likes me a lot now. I vanished a few days back, and I will reappear here tomorrow. Then we shall discuss his likes and dislikes. Who is it? First, I thought that he is mad. Later, I understood. Kittunni's case is enough to prove the judge's change in nature. He has stopped swearing at me. He now creates a fun atmosphere. - That girl is smart. She made the judge dance to her tune. Who is she to Joji? He said that she's his distant relative. I did not die because the old man doesn't have good aim. I removed five bullets from your body. Was there a missile inside? I just remember the sound of a bullet and a spark. Police are standing outside. - Ask them to come inside. You've been charged with attempted robbery. Make it a case of attempt to murder and ask them to hang me. Where were you? Sir, I was at Cuddalore with two foreign ladies. I came to know everything when I came here. Where is she? Nandini.. Come here. I must be beaten for helping her to find a shelter. Let go of her. She is a kid. Sir, keep quiet. She is grown up. She is not a kid. Just listen.. - Do not say anything! You addressed me as scoundrel because of her. When? - You called me a scoundrel at the tea shop. - Y-Yes. Who was responsible? She was responsible. You said that you would file a habeas corpus against me. - Yes. Who is responsible? She is responsible. You said that you would tie me up and kill me. - No. - Slap me? Y-Yes. - Who is responsible? It's her. And look at her! You! - No! - Go and get the luggage. Come with me. Get out. Go! - Joji. Yes? Enough. - What? It is.. - What? She is.. - I know that I am wrong. When she requested me, I thought she was an innocent girl. Actually, she is innocent. - But she is a brat. - Keep quiet. I will not let her stay here. I just made a mistake.. - I know, sir. You gave her a job here listening to my request. I am ready to take up any punishment for that. Why don't you go to Palani and shave your head bald? Get lost. - Okay, I see. Actually, I wanted to say.. I did feel bad initially, but now.. Now, you are angry at her, right? - No. - Get out, idiot. You came into this house like a kitten and enjoyed the royalty. Get out now! - Let me say.. - Get out. Her face says that she is arrogant. - I told you not to interfere. Go! Then.. Joji! - Yes. I scolded you. - It's because you could not scold her. I understand your feelings. I am not angry at her. - Yes, there's a limit. After that, you must beat her up. You did not hurt her because she was a girl. - Listen to me. You must have beaten her to death. No one would question you. I was ill. - She wouldn't have cared. It was because of her.. - That all problems were created. I know. She must not stay here anymore. Go! Joji! - What? - Don't utter a word. - What? She will not go from here, no matter who asks her to go. She will not go from here. I will not allow that. We have no issues between us. I like her very much. Just listen to me.. - You need not say anything! Can I call you by a name? - Okay. Thief Pillai.. "In the warmth of the month of 'Meenam'."

Get out. - I-I won't. Won't you? What is this? Your father has let her stay here. Where is dad? - He has gone to Coimbatore. She must go from here before dad comes back. Otherwise, things will get worse. What is it? What is the matter? Where can I find Joji? Move your cart aside. Sure. But before that, I need to tell you something. What is it? - Did you slap Nandini? Who are you to ask that? When did you start to disrespect me? I was the one who left Nandini in that house. So, you have such a job too! - Damn! Don't dare to touch her again! I will throw your bike off the cliff! You may go. Dad, do not play games. Joji, what does this hide and seek mean? You are playing hide and seek. Dad, daughter and her guard need not act in front of me. Shut up. Do not tell me to shut up which you do when you fail to find an answer. Do not stand here for a minute. Get out. I'll go now. But I will come back with everyone. Nandini.. Mercy. So my daughter has come to meet her father. But why did you act for that? To take revenge or to claim your rights? Joji, your act was very good. You were close to me. So you understood me completely and made me a fool. Leave that. What do you gain from this business? I did not do anything intentionally. I did it for Nandini.. - Stop. Do not elaborate. You will take time to explain as your plans were twisted. I am not in a mood to listen to it. I am.. I am shocked. Do not ask me to go away. I will not go even if you ask me to. I struggled a lot to see you and talk to you. I wanted to go back without hurting you. I did not intend to hide anything from you. When I became close to you I felt the greed to see you more. I knew that it would not be possible if I tell the truth. So I kept postponing my departure to the next day. I got the love that a father could give his daughter for a lifetime, in these few days. Those memories are enough for me. I have a request. Don't sacrifice anything for me. Do not lose anything. Kittunni! Why did all of you come here? All of us have decided to stay with you henceforth. What if I do not like it? We know your likes. That is why we've come here to object to them. We felt privileged that you were a supreme court judge. But, now.. - Oh! What happened now to damage your honour? - What can be worse than this? If you forget your family and walk around with your illegitimate daughter, how would anyone respect us? Damn! Stop it, swine! What will you lose, other than what I have given you? I live on my terms. My job is not to create honour for you. Father. I am never against your wishes, Father. But you must remember that you're choosing this life by giving up your family. Mr. Pillai, do you know all these people? No! No one is aware of the relationships. But luckily, the children know their father. What wrong did we do to force you to hate us? When we stopped you from meeting this girl, you ditched everyone, including her. Now, when she came into your life, you forgot us. We need to know whether you need your family or that girl? Father, just tell us who is supposed to get out from here. Father, please tell us. Let there be an end to this. I'll never ask you to go from here. You can consider this as my selfishness. This is a matter of the lives of many people. Nandini, I hope you have the heart to understand everything. Muthu, where is Samad Khan? It's urgent. That girl has left the house. If my father-in-law changes his heart, things will get worse. She must die at any cost. Khan! Khan.. Khan.. Where is Nandini? So, are you Joji? You are the one who beat my men up. I was waiting to meet you. I have come to get Nandini. I could have killed that girl if I wanted to. But I did not do that. I kept her here. I knew that you would come here for her. Where is Nandini? Do not touch him. This market belongs to me. These people would beat you up on my command. I will give you another chance. This is my kerchief. I am keeping it here. If you manage to take it from here you can take the girl and leave. I've heard that you are very brave. I want to see your might. What are you people staring at? Go and do your work. Mr. Pillai, come out! Mr. Pillai, come out! I know that you wouldn't have slept yet. You wouldn't be able to sleep. Your daughter, whom you threw out of your house was attacked by some thugs sent by your son and son-in-law. I had to fight in the marketplace. Your daughter is alive because I am even worse than them. I know that you are aware of everything. You have a lot of money. You can hire many more thugs. I am ready to face them. Just tell me the time and place. You are a judge who has given justice to many people based on truth. How could you let go of your daughter when she came yearning for you? Why didn't you think about respect and honour when you begot her? I will take care of her if you do not need her. She lived without a father until today. She will live like that henceforth. But if anyone has an objection, let me know right now. I know that the father does not have the guts. Let anyone who has the guts come before me. I came to know that. Does no one have the guts? Goodnight, Your Honour. Goodnight.. Sir. Last night, I was drunk and I said things I shouldn't have. I want to repeat my words today in sobriety. That is why I waited here to meet you. I understand a drunkard's truth and a normal person's lies. Joji, I have no one to call my own either. My family comprises of people who just need my wealth. In a way, I am also an orphan like you. I had only one godfather. Barrister Govinda Menon. I used to take tea to his law office. He supported me in my journey to becoming a supreme court judge. I had to conceal many truths for that person, whom I worship. But it is not required anymore. Your Nandini will soon get her father back. I give you my word. Believe me. I am going to pass the judgement of a case that was pending in my conscience for years. I brought up and educated Nandini. I had to let go of my family because of my relationship with her. I had to do it. I abandoned her as well and stayed here alone for many years. Most of you would know how she ended up in the mental hospital on the day she came to meet me. I know the reason for it as well. But she has come here searching for her father again. But that is not the case I am judging today. Do you remember Nandini's mother? Years back, when I was the judge and you were the prosecutor you met Devaki, a beautiful girl who was charged with prostitution. I do not remember. - Really? Why do you have to drag unnecessary matters here? Answer to the point. Do you remember? - No! 22 years back, you came to me saying that Devaki was pregnant and that would cause dishonour to your family. I remember that scared face of yours. Are you trying to frame him and escape? - No. There's no question of escape at all. I did not feel sympathy for you. But I feared that your father, who made me what I am today, would commit suicide. I took responsibility for the mistake you committed. So, Nandini's father? - It is him. Your husband. Why? Is it so hard to believe? There is only one witness to this incident. It was Devaki. She is not alive today. But do you disagree with what I said? Then I am ready to accept her as my daughter. I do not deny anything. Yes, she is my daughter. If you would accept her as our daughter.. No. Any passer-by can be a father to an orphan. If this is pleaded and proven in court the father would have to bear a daughter's expenses. But will she get care and love? Would that father call her a daughter with all his heart? I met the father whom I had come in search of. I do not need anybody's approval. This is my father. I need only him. Please do not deny my request. I had already decided in my heart. I can't erase it. Daughter! That is enough for me. I will not disturb you again. I'll never meet you either. You must allow me to love you, at least in my heart. She is alone. If you could take care of her.. Sir, I do not know if I could take good care of her. But I do have a heart that knows how to love and two hands to cuddle. But that is not enough to survive. Do you love her? - Yes. What about her? I have not asked her. I must go back. To the nuns who brought me up. I have a room there. I have a plate to eat food and a glass to drink water. There are many sisters who know to love. I will stay with them for the sake of the children like me who come to the monastery. Hey, hello. - I got to know that you came here. To be frank, I faced only difficulties after we parted ways. Why did we fight for a girl who came from somewhere? We did not fight. You fought with me. You.. Leave it.. A princess from Thripunithura came here to witness a puppet show with me. She went away after the show ended. We are left behind, right? - Did that girl go away? She is going tomorrow. She's gone to say her goodbyes. Didn't she say anything to you? Yes. She said goodbye. People who became close to us can gesture a bye any time without bothering about the depth of that relationship. Let it go. If it's goodbye, let it be so. Everyone who comes here is a tourist. They go back after enjoying here. People like me and you are just clowns who keep them happy to earn our living. We have no right to love or desire them. We can say just two words to them from the depth of our hearts. Welcome and goodbye. If we limit ourselves to that, we will always be happy. Always.. - Happy. - Happy. Coolie!
