Hey, this is Kat Oden, and you're watching my debut music video for "Selfish Girl" from my album, Gun To A Knife Fight right here on Radio American Music Channel thing. What's this called again? Hey, what's up? This is Kat Oden, punk rock phenomenon, and you are about to watch my music video Selfish Girl right here on RMV TV. That's not it at all, is it? Good day! My name is Kat Oden, and even though I'm an American now, the producers wanted me to sound more Australian. And you are about to watch my music video here on RMV TV. Hey, what's up? This is Kat Oden. You're about to watch my music video, Selfish Girl, from my new album, Gun To A Knife Fight, right here on RMV. I want you to listen. I want you to love me. I want to know how much you care about my new hobby and haircut and whether I choose truth or dare. Your girl, selfish girl-- We've got a wage increase, all right. But it couldn't raise the price that much. It just takes a little wood, rubber, paint, cloth, and a phony wig to make that doll. There's only about 10 cents worth of materials in the whole thing. You pirates, crooks, bandits, you-- you robbers! You're right about the cost of raw materials in that doll, about 10 cents worth. Raw materials in practically everything we buy are worth little until labor transforms them into finished products. For example, how much do you think the raw materials cost in that car? Well, about 300 bucks. You've got a surprise, John. It takes 4 and 1/2 tons of coal, 2 and 3/4 tons of iron ore, 50 pounds of cotton, 14 pounds of cured and finished wool, aluminum, zinc, lead, copper, and countless other raw materials to make an automobile. Without the addition of labor costs, these things are worth about $22. The raw materials require the accumulated labor of thousands of people in countless crafts to transform them into a finished automobile. Miners dig the coal and iron ore. Railroad and maritime workers transport these materials to the steel mill, where workers convert the ore into finished steel. The wages of railroad workers add to the value of steel when it is transported to automobile-- --factories that goes into a car and accumulates labor costs from the farmer who tills the soil, from workers who sow the seed and help to raise the crops. I'm not a scaredycat, and I'll stand, take a stand for that. I won't wait or be a bureaucrat except for when or when I'm wrong 'cause then I turn around and run. I won't mention it. I, I wont mention it. I, I won't mention it. Day after day after day after day, a little bitch. I'm a little bitch, oh, no. A little bitch, yeah. And I'm not a scaredycat and I'll stand, take a stand for that. I won't wait or be a bureaucrat except for when or when I'm wrong 'cause then I turn around and run. I, I won't mention it. I, I won't mention it. I, I won't mention it. Day after day after day after day after day, I won't mention it. I won't mention it. I won't mention it. Day after day after day after day after day after day after day. Dispatch for Detective Dobson, over. Dobson? Dispatch for Detective Dobson, over. Over, Dobson? Are-- Yeah, Captain. Yeah, I'll be there right away. Watch your step. A lot of refuse around here. Victim's name is Kat Oden. She's an Australian musician. It looks like she's about to take off her tour. So, she lives in Australia? No, she's from Australia. And she was leaving to go to Australia. Well, she's kind of a big deal over there. So, here, she's only achieved a modicum of success. Modicum? But basic Hollywood party, you've got food everywhere. Haven't found any drugs yet, but we're looking. They took my twisted knife. My twisted little knife-- Who's the douche bag in the video chat? Oh, that's Nick Boon. Have you heard the band Adorn? It sounds familiar. Wow. He has a big deal here. And he knows it, too. Yeah, they're all big deals, until they're not. Well, it looks like they're about to interview me. Wish me luck getting grilled by the cops. Boom, out. No offense, Officer. Detective. Who are you video chatting with? Video chat? No, man. This is just some of my fans. No big deal. Come on, let's get this over with. Let's start at the beginning. Look, man, I woke up to this. I mean, your guess is as good as mine. I called you right when I woke up. That's it. That's the beginning. That's the end. That's everything. So, you didn't hear anything. You didn't see anything. We've been sick-- for weeks, like, the flu or something. So, I may have passed out on cold medicine. You know how it is, pharmaceuticals. Sure, I know how it is. Lieutenant, I need a word, please. A little busy in here. It's very pressing, sir. Nick here didn't see anything, anyway. He's sick. Don't go anywhere. What? Sir, we have the media outside. What channel? It's not local. It's NIN. NIN? National Independent News. Yeah, I know who they are. But why are they here? This could be a cluster fuck. Get your shit together. Oh, man. What are you people doing here? I'm not going on the record. Your Honor? Did you see Nick Boon's livestream? His what? Livestream. Son of a bitch. I thought it was video chatting. Well, if you hate that, take a look at this. You think this guy knows where she is? Fuck, no, man. He's got over 10 million followers. This is a crime scene. Make sure you stay on the public street. And I'm not saying anything on or off the record. We're not your enemies, Detective, the USBCN is. I arrested my first one. You never know who you're going to meet on this job. Where'd the little prick go? I think he just left, sir. Fuck! Did I hear it correctly? Did-- did you let a suspect leave a crime scene, Dobson? Yes, Captain. Unbelievable. Unfucking believable, Dobson. We'll get him back. Don't freak out. Who the fuck are you? Where the fuck am I? Everything's going to be fine. My name is James. You've been kidnapped. What the-- by who? By me. What the fuck? Why are you in that stupid bear mask? It's not stupid. It's foreboding. Can you help me? And anyway, it's not a bear, and I can't have you recognizing me. It is a fucking bear. Why did you tell me your name? I didn't. What the fuck? Yes, you did. You literally just walked in here and said, "My name is James." Shit. Well-- Ow. --it's not a bear. It's the Idyll-Beast. What? It's a mythical creature. What the-- It lives here in Idyllwild, and it roams the forest. What the fuck? Are you fucking with me? No. And you're going to have to behave or else. Look, I don't have time for this. I don't have fucking time for this. I have a meeting at 2:00 with my manager. You mean your dealer. Yeah, same person, man. It's Hollywood, you fucking prick. If I don't get my medicine, I'm going to make your life a fucking nightmare. So, do us a fucking favor. Look, here's what's going to happen. Soon, you're going to be going through some pretty bad withdrawals-- and it's going to hurt. But the worst of it should be over in a few days. What-- come on. What are you even kidnapping me for, man? Nick's worth more than I am. Just try to relax. I've made some suggestions-- Sorry, sorry-- --here in the TV Guide. What the fuck, a TV Guide? The guitar is in case you get bored. Fuck! The democrats are well-known as a country. Is there a reason to be concerned about a second wave? Fucking-- Quantity is not quality when it comes to the multiple accusations against our commander-in-chief. These are all from his past. Did he, one day, decide to suddenly not be a sexual predator? Another woman from decades ago has accused our fearless President of unwanted sexual advances. Now, I am not saying we should not listen to her side of the story, but it is decades old. I can't remember what I had for breakfast yesterday-- --let alone someone who hit on me decades ago. I was so wasted. I was a hippie. I was a burnout. I was a dropout. I was out of my head. I was a surfer. I had a skateboard. I was no heavy, man. I lived on the strand. I was so wasted. I was so fucked up. I was so messed up. I was so screwed up. I was out of my head. I was so jacked up. I was so drunk up. I was so knocked out. I was out of my head. I was so wasted. I was wasted. We've received word that a Los Angeles-based musician has been kidnapped. Oh, fuck. I understand you all want information on this Kat Oden kidnapping. But listen very carefully, up to this point, we have not been in contact with the abductors. So, obviously, nobody has issued us any demands, all right? Captain-- Wait a minute. No, I'm not going to take any questions now. Dobson, I want to talk to you. Captain, captain-- Stay behind the line, folks. Stay behind the line. Come on, folks, you heard the captain. Do you think it's weird you are not in this conference? No. Someone told me you used to be an actor. And? Hero detective saves washed-up rock star? It's got a nice ring to it. I could get you some parts. That was a lifetime ago, lady. What do you want? A little preferential treatment, nothing scandalous. An insider's tip maybe? History has taught me there's no upside in feeding reporters. Maybe you just haven't met the right one. Excuse me. Well, it stops and look who graced us with his presence. What's this junkie doing back at my crime scene? Oh, well, I'll tell you a secret. He thinks he's here to give a TV interview. But the real reason he's here is to give you a second chance and not fucking up again. Let me ask you a question, Dobson, what the fuck were you doing on social media yesterday? I don't know what you're getting at, Captain. Well, let me elucidate you. Oh, yeah, the guys back at the station, they fucking love this. You're a fucking star. Once I fire you from this fucking case, you'll have plenty of time to go on the road. Hey! How the fuck is it that you haven't found anything I can use yet. Well, actually, sir, I've been looking for you. Where the fuck did you find this? In the guitar case. Perfect. Let's do it, man. Hey, guys, can I have the room for a minute? Now, let's go! Not you. You stay. Look, man, I told you everything I know. We fell asleep early watching TVs, bad cartoons. That's it. We were sick. We're fighting the flu or something, whatever it was. We just passed out-- on cold medicine, which to be honest, I need more of. So, I should probably get out of here. Don't worry. We found your prescription. Nick, I don't know what it takes to be a rock star. I assume probably requires a certain style of life. But do you know what it takes to be a detective? No, not really. Well, it mostly requires just not being a total fucking idiot. It also requires living in fucking reality. And in reality, I don't win anything by busting you for some smack. But I swear to Christ, if you hold out on me in this fucking interview, I will drop you into a world of shit. Yeah, man, we've been strung out for weeks, all right, maybe months, I don't know. I spaced out. Keep going. Keep going? Man, look, we wake up. We get high. We fuck. We watch bad TV all day. We get high again, rinse, recycle, repeat. This is my life. So, you got nothing for me. Oh. Nick, the last rock start we busted for this year, he got sentenced to six months mandatory rehab. Ooh. All right. No, wait, wait, wait. I might have something for you. But I need your discreetness. Discretion. What? The word is discretion. Yeah, man, that. Whatever, man. Look, I'm only interested in getting her back. You saw that bunny rabbit in the living room? It's a nanny cam. Sometimes when-- when we get fucked up-- we do some freaky shit. I'm going to need that footage. Well-- I can give that to you. But I need it back. And-- I need that. Shut up. Hey! Hey. Just give it up, dude. Just give it up. What do you want? I've had time to think. About? Whatever you want, you can ask, money, attention. I don't fucking care if you keep me here. Just go and get me some fucking medicine, please. Are you that desperate already? Yeah, I'm a fucking junkie. You feel like a big man now? Come on. You're no good to me if you'd OD'd. You want to fuck around, sir? Is that what you want? Captain! Today, we're joined via satellite by Andrea and Jack Oden, the parents of Kat Oden, and their lawyer, Kirby Smothers. Welcome. Yes, thanks for having us on, Hank. Now, before we get started, I'd like to say that Mr. and Mrs. Oden understandably are very concerned about their daughter's whereabouts. If anyone has any information, you can contact us on the website that we've just started Well, the website certainly sounds important to you. Yes, yes, look, if you're a fan and you'd that's the way to go. My biggest fear is that they're going to find her dead in a ditch somewhere. Well, hold on, just a second, this is just coming in. Breaking news, authorities say that they have released a partial photograph of the kidnapper. This was taken from security footage. Oh, damn. Hold on, more breaking news, sources say that the alleged kidnapper has been identified as James David Winandi. Is that Winandi? Winandi, James David Winandi. Oh, damn. Jimmy, they know who you are. This photograph was taken from an old Myspace profile. It's only a matter of time. Well, it's apparent that authorities are leaving no stone unturned in this manhunt. Yes, Kirby Smothers, please. I'd like to talk to him. Dobson, where the hell are you? Tell him Detective Dobson from the LAPD called. And I'd like access to any tips that you get. You can call me anytime. Thank you. - Yes, Captain. - Am I bothering you? - No. - Oh, good. Dobson, can you tell me how USBCN made his identity before you did? Word is they didn't, sir. Apparently, it was a Redditor. What the hell is a Redditor? Reddit is a website where people exchange information-- it was a guy on the internet. You're killing me. Are you telling me that a person on the internet cracked this guy's identity before you did? Yes. If you can't solve this crime before some Jack off on the internet does, then you can kiss your job goodbye. And then, I don't know where you're going to find your holster-sniffing, Donut Dollie badge bunnies to bang anymore. I'll do my best not to disappoint you, Captain. You've already disappointed me. Why don't you do your best to keep your fucking job. And another thing, this circus, it stops. Your job is to solve this crime, not ham it up in front of the goddamn cameras, understood? Copy that. Copy that. Hey, you two-- Hi, Hank Flowers with this USBCN exclusive interview with Kat's long-time boyfriend and lead singer of the rock band, Adorn. Thanks for joining us, Nick. Welcome. Thank you, Hank. Happy to be here. Happy to do whatever I can to get her back, so. So, Nick, the question that's on everybody's minds, I think, everybody wants to ask you right now, did you do it? Did you kidnap your girlfriend? God, no, Hank. Oh, how worth it to get the exclusive for this. What? Before you open mouth, look for the term "rhetorical." I don't have to Google it because I went to writing school. Thank you very much. You did, did you? Fuck these assholes. --right now in on all major musical platforms, streaming-- How does USBCN keep getting these people? Everybody's got an angle. Rock star sells his music. Flowers gooses his ratings. And the owners keep pushing this website for some reason. Of course, they are. Yeah, but why? I can't get access to the tips they're getting. Well, have you seen how much revenue the site is bringing? And here I am thinking, you're a detective. Ever seen a missing person site with ads on it? And how much do you think they're paying them to be on? It's gross. Well, you're profiting, too. You're in for a promotion if you crack the case-- You will have folks-- --unless that's not what you want. I became a cop at 30. Nobody who wants to be a cop becomes a cop at 30. Starring lead singer Nick Boom allegedly not-- So, you'd rather be in front of, what, the camera on NIN? Here's Goodnight by Adorn. Keep your phone on. - By Adorn. - It's great. Wonderful, Nick. Nick-- Nick, what if Kat were out there right now, perhaps listening, perhaps watching this very interview, what would you say to Kat if you could talk to her right now? Gorgeous lying bitch. Well-- do you want me to... right now? Go ahead. Talk to her. Honey, come home safe. You know, like, um... Just grab a knife and like stick it into him, stick it into this James guy. Kill him. Do whatever you got to do, baby, because I love you. And I want you to come home safe. And I need my twisted little knife back. You willingly have sex with this guy? Yeah, sometimes. What a douche. Why are you with him? Do you want me to share my innermost feelings with you, Jimmy? Is that what do you want? I don't know. He fucking scores drugs for me without being so goddamn fucking nosy. That's why I fuck him. And you don't think you're better than that. Mr. Kidnapper, living high atop your mountain of superiority... why don't you tell me more about how to live my life, huh? Your parents really did a number on you, didn't they? You have no idea. It's all we want to a guy. Everything you're looking for. What it takes to be a hoe, taking now the shot. humanity Please, stop. Please, stop. Yeah, I'm in. You're going to have to behave for this. Do you understand? Easy. It's OK. Just water. Sorry. Well? Come on in. Want one? No, thank you. Take a seat. Julie Martin, a.k.a. Julia Gonzalez Martinez, born in Mexico City, 1985. Why the name change? It tested better with the network. We need to keep this classy. This isn't an episode of Cops. Sure. Whatever you want. If this happens, I need to know I'm being taken cared of. This? I have an exclusive. And you're going to want it. That's pretty unorthodox. And this isn't? I deserve mine. Let me talk to my boss. Not good enough. This isn't the spotting of some suspect. This is much, much bigger. And if I give you this, I'm going to need assurances. Like? I want a pilot. For what? A plane? Don't be cute. But it's a huge request. If I'm going all in, I need to know what cards I'm holding. Come on, it's about the case. Half-hour pilot, nothing fancy. But if it doesn't work out, we'll hire you on as a crime expert. What does the Russian government know that the American public does not? Tonight, we discussed the possibility that the Russian government is sending spies into Washington, D.C. to influence our elections. Investigations have proven-- hold on. We're getting breaking news on the Kat Oden kidnapping case. Oh, wow. It's now being reported by NIN that Kat Oden was raped in the months preceding the kidnapping. Fuck. Apparently, footage is being released of several of the incidents. Am I hearing that right? I guess they have no shame. Well, this, no doubt, adds fuel to suspicions of Nick Boon's involvement-- Maybe you shouldn't. --in the kidnapping case. As many of you know-- Ladies and gentlemen, we've just received footage from an anonymous source. The images we are about to show you are highly upsetting. Viewers discretion is advised. Here, we see Nick Boon taking drugs with what seems to be Kat Oden. This is just beyond words. As per FCC regulations, we have blurred out the next section of this footage. Ladies and gentlemen, this appears to be footage of Nick Boon-- Did you know? Of course, I fucking knew. --of drugging and then raping Kat Oden. I mean, the piece of shit was videotaping it. But I know what he does. I'm not a fucking idiot. Why do you let him, Kat? I don't give a fuck. The piece of shit was probably going to try and extort me with the footage, anyway. I wish he had. I don't know what to say. Do you want me to change it? No. Don't bother. I deserve this. I'll make us some dinner. The old days are gone. Ooh, time goes so fast. Like the cars or the trains, we'll watch them go past. But the feeling's still here. Ooh, it won't leave me be. I didn't waste no time. But time wasted me. Hmm. When the chariot-- I didn't-- I didn't have any butter for the toast. Sorry. But they could not carry me home. Then the circle was broke before I could speak now. Ooh, my faith is gone. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. You mean to tell me you've had burgers here the entire time? Fuck, at least, I could go and smoke when they stuck me in rehab, fuck! God. You're fucking cleaning me up, aren't you? What the fuck! Is that what this is? You're cleaning me up, aren't you? Why? Because you need it. Oh, fuck you, man. Fuck. What are you thinking handling zombie monster with your hands? I have no fucking idea. Today we come live from Winandi Publishing, owned by Marshall Winandi and brother of Kat Oden's alleged kidnapper, James David Winandi. The Winandi Publishing Company was once the biggest-- that's him. That's him. That's him. Mr. Winandi, Mr. Winandi, any comment about your brother? Unfortunately, my brother is a very sick man, and I can't make any further statements to the press, which, as a publisher, is kind of ironic. Strange world, huh? That was Marshall Winandi, brother of James David Winandi, commenting on his mental instability. How do I edit a tweet? Do you have to do that right now? Yeah. Hey, hey, hey, I'm on the phone. Well, you didn't tell me to stop. Hold on. Go ahead, you find me anything? No, sir. His previous residence is empty. But I tell you, he's got to be loaded because that house is designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. His house is made by the man that created planes? Good for you, sir. I'll be in in a minute. --of an NIN exclusive interview with Kat's long-time manager, Bernie Blathe. Welcome to the show, Mr. Blathe. Thanks. Let me start off by saying, Kat is like a daughter to me. As soon as she made that big leap across the pond, I took her under my wing, groomed her as a performer and a non-me-too kind of way. Of course. Kat has been described by many as the arm candy of Adorn's singer, Nick Boon. However, she does have her own much smaller career in the sub-genre of punk rock. Kat insists on waving that egregious punk rock flag, even though the genre hasn't been profitable since Devo. Motherfucker. Well, since Kat is from Australia, she doesn't actually have family out here. You were saying-- Like clockwork. Is that your-- My manager and dealer going on about my dependency issues? Yeah, it is. So, I'm guessing you're a fan, hmm? More or less. I guess I get that. But what gives you the right to try and clean me up, huh? Because nobody else is. And that fucking matters to you? Because-- --everybody in your life is just messing you up. Those are big words coming from my kidnapper. That doesn't make them wrong. You're worth so much-- to so many. And you're just too damn beaten down to realize it. Why do you let yourself be abused by the people who are supposed to be looking out for you? So, what? Do you think I've got some great insight into humanity or something, man? I hate to tell you, I'm just a used up junkie, anxiously awaiting the day that she can join the 27 Club. That's it. You do make a difference to a lot of people. - I don't. - You do. - I don't. - You do. - I don't - You do. I don't. I can't. Besides, my family just doesn't not constitute a lot of people. I don't know if you know that. I'm not a rock star. I'm a sheep in wolf's clothing. Everyone builds me up to be this fucking icon or something, man. I'm just a bitch that likes to play the guitar. That's all I want. Oh. So, that's why you murdered it. Pfft, yeah. Kat's mash on. Obviously. Look, you need to eat. You got to keep up your energy. I got an errand to run anyway today. Be careful. Just try not to get shot. Every two minutes, they've got your picture on TV. I'll be fine. Eat, food. I'll be back in a bit. Hi, I'm Detective-- Just a second, please. Yeah, I'm working on it. Oh, him? Yeah, he's here, too. Mr. Winandi will be right up. He's been expecting you. Charming. Charlotte. Yes? Make sure the car is brought up. Of course. What are you up to here? Hmm, hmm. Fuck! Aah! Detective Dobson, right? Yes, sir. Thought I might see you earlier than this. Well, I'm investigating quite a few leads, Mr. Winandi. Well, unfortunately, I haven't seen my mentally ill brother in a number of years. So, it looks like you've made this trip in vain. I don't know about that. I've got a few questions I'd like to ask you, sir. Sure, you do. And I'm sure you can appreciate, as a private citizen, I'm going to have to insist that my lawyer be present. So, maybe we can contact the Department and set something up for tomorrow? I'm already here now. Ha. Let's take a couple of minutes and we can sort this out. Yeah, again, gonna have to insist? You see, unlike my brother, I have a legacy to protect. Charlotte, always be thinking three steps ahead and never be a pawn. As we all hang on to every detail of the case, still no word from the abductor, from the abductee, from no one. And worse than that, according to sources, no progress has been made by Detective Dobson in the kidnapping of pop star, Kat Oden. Pop star? Fuck you. I'm a punk rock, bitch. The Winandi publishing company was once the-- Still breaking things, I see. That's him. That's him! Reality TV can be so fake. I have a feeling I can relate. I'm glad you made it back in one piece. What was so pressing that you brave the legions of people calling for your head on a stick? It's just cold. I had to pick this up. You know you and I have a bad history with guitars, right? Yeah. Well, here's hoping you don't try to kill me with this one. Hey, are you gay? Oh, wow. My brother really does have an effect on people. No, no, it's just you're obviously a fan. But you don't want to fuck me. And I take it that's abnormal. Yep. No. I'm not gay. So, you kidnapped me to clean me up. But you don't seem crazy enough to actually do something like that. What gives? People like you-- they saved me. What's that mean? You remember the first time you ever listened to The Clash or Bad Religion, or the Stooges or the Pogues, or Minor Threat or-- that music didn't just get me through the day. It gave me something to live for. Bit of a drama queen, aren't you? Well, like it or not, religion is embedded in us through evolution, tribalism, herd mentality, or just the intrinsic desire to belong to something bigger, bigger than us. That's what punk rock is to me. That's what your music could be to a whole generation. I don't think so. You put on this self-destructive persona because you've been hurt. Here we go. You've been betrayed by everyone you ever trusted, and yet, you hold out hope, regardless. You sure about that? George Carlin once said that if you scratch any cynic, you'll find a disappointed idealist. Your music, your lyrics, they weren't written by someone who hates people, Kat. So, what? People like that are rare. They need to be protected. The few-- critics-- --that bothered to listen to this album-- were floored by the lyrics of a 19-year-old girl. And then your next album went silver. Yeah, I saw that coming. You may not be embraced by the masses yet, but people are listening. And the people that matter, they're starting to pay attention. But if you don't fuck it up, you could be the voice of a whole generation. God knows we need one. Flattering will get you everywhere. Look, I-- I know that this is all-- It's insane. It's-- it's insane. But it's not for you. It's not for me. It's for all the lives you can save through your music. Creating music, it's not the same as being a cop or a firefighter or first responder. But musicians are just as important. They may not save one life at a time or hell, maybe they do-- but at a minimum. Musicians, poets, they can affect mass change in the conversation. Just... consider not wasting your gift. Yeah. What about you? I'm not a optimist. I'm not a pessimist, either. I'm-- I'm a realist. None of this is going to end well. Welcome back to KLOS, your home for modern rock. Have you heard about this Kat Oden situation? We all love the band, Acorn, or at least we used to. But who knew the singer's girlfriend was the one with all the talent. Here's Kat Oden's single, Up My Skirt, from her second album, Gun To A Knife Fight. He looked up my skirt on the escalator. He saved that thought. Hey, another time, I did it again and never learned, So I want to win. Hold on, I'm going to put you on speaker. Hey, Julie, when are we shooting my pilot? Very funny. Look, we're still in business. But we're going to have a hard time spinning the skills of someone who's coming up empty. I'll have you know I'm making excellent progress. I hope so. You got nothing to worry about. Glad to hear it. I assume that you interviewed Marshall. He lawyered up. I got an interview with him tomorrow. But I don't think he's a talker. We're joined by Marshall Winandi, brother of the alleged kidnapper and CEO of Winandi Publishing. Welcome. Thanks for having me. So, at a young age, could you tell that James had mental problems? Well, James was always a bit different, very quiet, kept to himself. And then, I guess you could describe him as a loner. He would only speak to about two, maybe three people. And-- I mean it, then nobody else. It doesn't sound totally abnormal. He would spend most days in our maid's quarters, just staring at her family photos. The maid? You see, our parents were incredibly busy people, both of them working professionals. So, I guess-- I don't know. My brother saw her as more than a maid, a nanny, a substitute mother, maybe. I don't know. I was young, too. This lasted how long? Her employment, about 10 years. Why did it end? She was caught stealing my mother's jewelry. So, they let her go. Well, yeah. It sounds was like they took away someone that he cared for. She was an employee. She worked for us. And she wasn't a very honest employee, either. You don't keep someone around just because a child has grown attached and attached to a thief. It looks I'm not the only one with family problems. What's your biggest worry about your brother's current situation? The situation? You mean, that he's kidnapped someone? Well, I guess-- well, obviously, I'm worried about my brother's welfare. And God forbid that he's torturing her. After your parents passing, how did you handle it? I stepped up. I had to take over the empire. You got it? And I became my brother's legal guardian. I did my best. We had just lost our parents. Somebody had to step in. It was me. I was all he had. At a point, you just throw your hands up. I did my best. I had to run the business. I had lost my parents, too. I'm not a babysitter. I'm a brother doing the best that I can. Did you-- I'm his brother, not his daddy. I lost my parents, too. Everybody has pain. You have pain. I mean, I wish it could have been different, of course. You think I wasn't lonely, huh? I lost my mom. You just put your head down, shoulder the wheel. You keep going. Some people just aren't equipped. They fall apart, weak. Some are weak. I hate to say it. My brother-- he-- his mind wasn't strong. Maybe I was born with a better mind-- Come on. --or resolve. Some might say better character. Shouldn't you get that? Intuition. Stay in your lane. Yeah. Thanks for your time, Marshall. No problem. That's Marshall Winandi, alleged brother of the kidnapper. Tell me you have something for me, something from the website, or something from fucking anywhere. We finally received a tip from someone The problem is it's over 30 hours old by now. Give me something I can use and I'll get you a raise. Well, a gas station attendant reported someone matching Winandi's description driving through a few days back. All right, text me all the details on that and anything else that you have. Should I get an Uber? Julie, yes. Sorry, I was looking into a lead. How soon can you meet me? You're still getting me out of this parking ticket, right? Oh, God. Jesus. Hey, cuffs are only fun for about a half hour at a time. Am I right? How did you-- how? I've always wanted to learn how to pick locks. I don't know if that's what I did, or if it was just dumb luck. Kind of impressive, huh? I really thought this was a fake. Good on you for committing. Ha. Thanks. You got to work on your nerves. Really? Hey, it's OK. You're in charge. I'm just sick of that goddamn bed. Want to eat at the table like a couple of humans? Sure. OK. Me? Yeah. I haven't have an appetite in years. Fuck, yeah. Damn, I'm starved. Why didn't you shoot me? Intentions. I'm not sure I follow. You know how people say intentions are meaningless and so, results that count? I think that's a bit drastic. After all, a bad act can still have a positive result. But equally as important is the intention, and the result is the action. You know, they say America might have known Pearl Harbor was going to happen. They let it because it forced us into a war which defeated Adolf fucking Hitler. Are you sure about that? Kidnapping someone? Dragging them into your car to an unknown location and chaining them to a bed? It's pretty disturbing when you think about it. I suppose I would be forced to agree. But as horrible is your action was, your intention was noble. And your result, well, I guess, well, you had to see that. But I'm leaning towards the results being at least, in part, positive. I'm glad to see you're feeling better. At the moment, you're two out of three. And according to the great prophet, Loaf, it ain't bad. Oh, not fucking Meat Loaf. What's going on? What happened? Well, we got a positive ID on Winandi at a gas station about two hours east of here. Seems legit, so I'm going to run out and take a look. Great. But do you want my honest opinion? All right. It's past midnight. If we shoot something right now, no one's watching. But if we roll it tomorrow early in the morning, it's breaking news. Do you want me to sit on this? It's better for you if you do. Look, it's only a two-hour drive. You can go back home, get some rest, and we'll hit it again in the morning. If anybody finds out about this, I am fucked. Text me the address of the gas station and the time you'll be there. We'll make it look classy. Your parents, accident happened around this time? I don't know why you're putting that in quotes? They were my parents. They had an accident about a year after the maid was let go, yes. What happened? How did they-- the accident? They died in a freak car accident. The papers reported that they had been drinking. What papers, a tabloid? A rival tabloid? Not surprising. How did your brother handle the accident? James? Shut up. Do you want to talk about it or something? Oh, there's not much to talk about. My parents were luscious. They just didn't want to have anything to do with me. Oh, she was such a clever girl growing up. Oh, just in time. When she was a teenager-- Let's turn the subject back on to you, shall we? She was the one who cracked the premiums. One minute, I see her out there chatting up the cable man, and-- next minute, we got pay-per-view. I mean, I got to tell you, they don't look that bad. We've set up this page on the world wide web to go to www-- Once they realize I was talented, they wanted a piece. --findkatoden-- Somehow, someway, those three idiots made all the money off my first two albums. How did they do that? Gun was released when I was 19, but I was fucking 17 when I recorded it. So, yeah. Well, at least, they didn't ship you off to half a dozen boarding schools. Really? If we're measuring dicks, I think I had it a little rougher than you. How's that? No offense, but you had money. That makes life a lot easier. Oh, yeah? So, how's that working out for you since you've gotten so rich? Fuck, man. It's different. No! When you grow up without the love of a parent, money does not help. Sometimes it can make it worse. The only family I ever really love was-- Your nanny, right? This is really annoying. Yeah. We could stop. You don't have to-- When my parents fired her, I just-- I realized that not only did they not care, but-- they had the power to take away the people that I cared for. It must be weird when people are paid to love you. Oh, no, Camilla loved me in her own way. But ultimately, also, I was a paycheck. And there's nothing wrong with that. He said she stole from them. Is that right? I knew she didn't have much. So, I took a pair my mother's earrings, and I put them in her purse. Fuck. I just-- wanted her to have something nice. I'm sorry for what I said. Oh, it's all right. Shit happens. You get over it. You move on. No, you don't. It's a load of bullshit that teachers push on you. The reality is shit's going to follow you around for your entire life. Yes, you cannot forever blame your bullshit on your parents, but like, fuck. When you get that fucked up in such an early age, it's in your DNA. It makes you look for acceptance in other places. Yeah, exactly, music, punk rock-- Punk rock? Separate yourself from the masses, become untrusting. Just like Kurt Cobain said, just because you're paranoid-- It don't mean they're not for you. The President's bungling of the strike response, especially in places like Seattle, where protests have been known to turn violent, has made Democrats nationwide-- Oh, wow. I'm pretty gross, time to bathe. I wasn't going to say anything. But you do smell pretty ripe. --has led the Democratic hopefuls finally seeing the spotlight. I would wrap that ankle. They shift toward the younger and more liberal-- Oh, wow. Thanks for your concern, Mr. Kidnapper. I think I'll be OK. Let's take a look at the latest-- It's over before it starts. Oh, don't you know? So, on your mark, stand by, ready, go. From London to New York, Montreal to Tokyo, I see visions of her everywhere I go. What have I become? Now, I'm on my own. I'm just looking for a way to break on through these walls. And I'm just looking for a place that I can call my home. Does anybody out there got a soul? 'Cause I'm just looking for the girl, the girl with a heart of gold. The country, is there a reason to be concerned about a second wave? Well, recent studies are suggesting that-- Thanks for the-- Maybe we shouldn't be as worried-- --Seattle flannel. --as many health professionals. According to him, it doesn't matter. There have been a lot of cases of this Chinese-born virus. But according to the surgeon general-- Do you mind if we watch something else for a bit? Go for it. We should be concerned over the failing economy. Well, recent studies are suggesting that-- Oh, my God. Have you ever watched Sea Hunt with Lloyd Bridges? It's amazing. He narrates the show like God, while driving around and saving the world like an underwater MacGyver. At the end of the episode, he gives a little more. It's epic. I take it you watch this growing up. Reruns are actually how I fell in love with America. What'd you watch? Not much of anything, really. Old Andy Griffith episodes, mainly. We didn't have cable. I mean, don't get me wrong. I love Andy Griffith, but all rich people have cable. Well, you don't get rich spending frivolously, as my father always said. My parents insisted on cable. We couldn't afford it, and sometimes we didn't eat. But we had it all the same. That's despicable. You can make it without a snorkel? Don't worry. I'll get one. There are plenty of skin divers on this part of the coast. The night after tomorrow night, I'll be waiting two miles off Rocky Point. Check. It was late afternoon by the time he got back to Marineland with the day's catch. I was especially excited about the new young porpoise Kate and I have caught that day. Like all porpoises out of water, he lay still, not moving a muscle. Perhaps-- Meet Joe, the king of the workers of the world. Hi, folks. Joe is the king because he can buy more with his wages than any other worker on the globe. Now, what makes it possible for Joe to have such good living? He can go smarter-- - Hello. - Where do I meet you? I'm over here at the gas station. Give me about 15 minutes. And when you show up, act like you tailed me. Don't get scared, Detective. I told you. We'll make it look classy. All right. Hello! Anybody here? Hang on. Oh, look at this. I assume you're the person who called in the Oden family website. Guilty. You said you had some security camera footage of the kidnapper Remember anything about him? Was she in the car when he came in? I'm not allowed to comment on ongoing investigation. I would've ripped his fucking balls off if I knew. Well, lucky for him. He seemed squirrelly kind of cute, not really the kidnapping type. Not the kidnapping type, great. Any other observations? I've got a few I could share with you. I bet you do. Just show me that footage. Jesus. Let's go. Let's go. You talk, I'll shoot. Detective! Detective, a couple of questions, please. How did you find me? Is it true that James David stopped here at this gas station right after he kidnapped Kat? I can't comment on an ongoing investigation, except to say we're making progress. Well, has anybody seen anything? Oh, well. That's cut, I guess. How was that? Oh, you looked great. Are you serious? Again? Man, like, news team. It wasn't too forceful? No, you were fine. So, what did he buy? Where are we going? Head east towards the high desert. That's all I have right now. But I will text you as soon as I have more. All right. Kevin! Where did you go? Let's get a wide shot of the gas station. Owens. Yeah, I need you to run a plate for me. Jimmy! Jimmy, Jimmy. Oy, James! It's a long story. I feel like I missed something. I had a rough night. Damn. I'm almost proud. As thanks for my liberation, I shall make breakfast. Ooh. This is the gas station where James David was last seen. What did he buy? Where did he go? Did anybody see anything? Comment? Yeah, I've got a comment. Oh, God, that smells amazing. Yeah, well, it's ruined now because you don't have any milk for the gravy. Gravy, huh? You're spoiling me? Well, not anymore, I'm not. They saw that car at the gas station, Jimmy. They got to have an APB out for it. Fair enough. No, it's fine. Come on. What are you going to do? Walk? It's half a mile. It's not safe, is what it is. Do you want me to miss the first homemade breakfast I've had in 20 years? No, thanks. I'll be fine. I'll be back in a bit. Owens, what's up? Just checking on you. There's a lot of rumors going around the station. Like what? Oh, just crazy stuff, like, you're leaking info to the press, or that you're more concerned with having your face on TV than you are catching the perp. Look, Owens, Chad, the work that I do, that we do, it's important. We're working for the little guy or in this case, the little girl. And nothing's more important to me than getting this girl back alive. So, if I'm not at the office as much or worshipping at the feet of the Captain, it's because I'm out here doing the hard work, the Lord's work, our work. Just do me a favor. And if you find them, please call it in, and don't be a hero. There's no police presence up there, maybe a few fire trucks. And if anything happens backup is at least an hour out. Well, I can't tell you what it means to have you there working with me, pal. As soon as I know something, I'm going to give you a call. Go and grab your gun. You got him on the run 'cause he's an alien. They hurt what they don't understand. There we go. So you've got to turn away. There's no other way 'cause you're an alien. They hurt what they don't understand. Ow, fuck! Got him on the run, go and grab your gun 'cause he's an alien, alien, alien, alien boy. Kat, it's the police. You're safe. Where are you? Kat, the kidnapper is not in the house. You can call out. Where are you? This is my kind of town. Are you kidding me? As soon as I win an Emmy, done. I'm going to retire up here in Idyllwild. This is beautiful. You get here late all the time. And you want to win an Emmy? It's adorable little town. You didn't smoke right now. Of course, I did. You're driving high right now. I'm not going to drive to Idyllwild sober. Of course, I'm stoned. But look how well I'm doing. Like, we didn't miss anything, every stop sign there is. Hi. We've got to go, James. They found us. That's the-- that's the cop from TV. Mm-hmm. You can't do that to a police officer. We've got to run. You've got to run. He's trying to help you, Kat. Mm-hmm. I mean, how the hell did you even tape him up? Oh, Jesus. Please, we don't have time for this. He had to have radioed for backup before he came. So, let's just leave. This isn't right. Oh, thank Christ. Are you all right? She hit me with a fucking frying pan. I think I have a concussion. So, you weren't even really kidnapped. Oh, no, he fucking kidnapped me. It's a long story, man. Do you want a glass of water? Yeah. All right, look, hey, if we don't get out of here this second, you're fucked. Julie Martin, the NIN reporter? Hey, what the fuck is going on? It's professional courtesy to alert the media. No, it is not. All right, here we are. Make it look classy. Here's your Emmy, Kevin. Let's go. Talk. Now. Look, we all play this right, everybody leaves happy. You do minimum time. Your album sales are better than ever. Everybody wins. What is it that you win? I get a TV show. Oh, this motherfucker. Ladies and gentlemen, we may very well be witnessing the final moments of Kat Oden's kidnapping. Our sources say that lead detective Dobson is not only hot on the trail-- Let's just make a break for it. I don't want anybody to get hurt. Nobody has to get hurt, not if we're on the same page. Look, I march him out. I tell the judge he cooperated. This is all over. No, no! He's right. He's right. We have to let him go. Take it away, Julie. You're insane. I'm standing in front of the cabin, where allegedly, Kat Oden is being held. The kidnapper, James David, walked from the gas station until here. Detective Dobson is inside. We're coming in very close to the-- Oh, you fucking bastard. See? Hey, drop that fucking knife, or I will end you. He's not only hot on the trail-- You take care of yourself. I didn't want this. I want this thing to end quietly. And now, you've given me no choice. I'm standing in front of the cabin, where allegedly-- Don't. I'll stab the bitch! James, you dumb fuck. Oh, my God, there's been a gunshot. There's been a gunshot. Fuck! You fuck! We're going to get closer to the window. Detective, what happened in there? Kat Oden knocked me out and tied me up. I was able to escape, incapacitate her, and neutralize the kidnapper. She had time-- so, Kat Oden attacked you. Well, I think we have a case of Stockholm syndrome. When people are left in isolation with their captors, sometimes they get brainwashed by them. Thank you. Thank you, Detective. That was Detective Dobson, the man who single-handedly saved musician, Kat Oden, from her kidnapper, James David Winandi. This is Julie Martin reporting for NIN tonight. Today brought the end of the American media circus that was the kidnapping of musician Kat Oden. In the end, Detective Dobson appears to have saved the self-proclaimed punk rocker from an inevitable death at the hands of James Winandi. Look, you're absolutely right. But the fact of the matter is that this Kat is not the Kat that we all know and love. Two weeks on and the Kat Oden case continues to make stunning headlines. Investigations into Dobson's activity as lead detective in this case came to a close today. And although District Attorney did say that Dobson indeed violated protocols, no charges will be filed in the case. This, of course, comes on the heels of last week news that Kat's boyfriend, Nick Boon, will be cleared of all rape charges. I would like to personally reintroduce you to Charles Dobson, former detective and now host of his own show on our network, The Dobson Files. Thank you, Julie. And let me say how pleased and proud I am to be the newest member of the NIN family. Each week on The Dobson Files, I'll be taking a look at a major criminal-- Six months after her kidnapping, a self-proclaimed sober and stronger Kathleen Oden is set to return to the stage next week. Miss Oden. I told you, call me Kat. I'm not going to do that. I'm going to need you to sign these for the house. I'm on it. Oh, by the way, your ex is here. Oh. He wanted me to give you this. I said no. But he gave me $100. Smart girl. You want to split it? No. It's all you. Rad. And you're up in 5. Copy, 5. No sympathy. For delayed reactions. No sympathy. For a lazy transaction. No sympathy for my needs. I ain't got no sympathy for me. No sympathy. for distractions and frustrations. No sympathy. For a raw temptation. No sympathy for my needs. I ain't got no sympathy for me. One point if you try. Two points you deny. Three points if you pry away your eyes. One point if you try. Hey. Two points you deny. Hey. Three points if you pry away your eyes. No sympathy.

Dead weight fucker. No sympathy. I got no ideas about where I'm going. No sympathy. I'm a stupid sucker, dead weight fucker. And I got no ideas about where I'm going. One, two, three, go! Well, all my life this music saved me. I can't afford no therapy. My frustration, it needs release. So cut me open and hear me bleed. Playing punk keeps me sane. I don't need drugs to numb the pain. It keeps me alive. I hope it helps you. I won't let your worthless America ruin me. No way! I'm screaming out, somebody listen. It feels so good, this therapy. I'm screaming out, somebody listen. It feels so good, this therapy. I lost control and hurt myself. I knew deep down that I need some help. This self-abuse, it would not stop, no matter how hard I tried. So I lied when I tried to pull myself together. Am I going insane? Think again. I got so fed up with being unstable. No more! I'm screaming out, somebody listen. It feels so good, this therapy. I'm screaming out, somebody listen. It feels so good, this therapy. I'm screaming out, somebody listen. It feels so good, this therapy. I'm screaming out, somebody listen.
