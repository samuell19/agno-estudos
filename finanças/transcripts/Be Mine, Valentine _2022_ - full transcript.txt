This is gonna be so awesome. Six days and counting, George. Best Valentine's Day ever! No question. Oh, I'm so nervous, I don't think I can stand it. We've been prepping this for months. Everything's gonna go according to plan, trust me. Yeah, I know, it's just, I've never proposed to anyone before, you know? And I've never wanted to until... until I met Lisa. You two are perfect for each other. - You really think so? - Yes! Of course. I could tell that the moment I first saw you two together. I have an instinct about these things. OK. This has to be spectacular. It will be. OK. What if she says no? George... Close your eyes. Come on. Come on, close your eyes. Now... Hmm. Picture Lisa. Imagine the moment you're about to propose. What does you heart tell you she's gonna say? Yes. See? Hold on to that moment! You've waited all this time for the right person to come along. True love is something two people experience together. It's what makes them one. That means she's feeling exactly what you're feeling. - OK! - OK? - Thank you, Piper. - Yes, of course. Hey! It's gonna be great. Oh! That was really beautiful what you said. Thanks, Bree. It's the truth. OK, I have 6 bookings on Valentine's Day. Why doesn't anybody want to propose on the 15th? Um, because that would be anticlimactic? It'd be unexpected. And a waste of time if your honey breaks up with you 'cause she was expecting a ring on the 14th. Yeah, I suppose. OK, closing time. Hey, will you help me pick out a Valentine's Day card for Ethan on the way home? If I have to. Oh, wow! Your enthusiasm is really overwhelming. You know how I feel about Valentine's Day. How could I forget? A proposal planner who hates the most romantic day of the year. Hey, shhh! What if my clients find out? Your secret is safe with me. Oh! Proposals by Piper, this is Piper. Hey, Piper! Um, my name is Jordan Freeman. I was hoping you could, um, help me propose to my boyfriend. Yeah, sure. When are you thinking of proposing? Valentine's Day. The Valentine's Day that's 6 days from today? Uh... Yeah. Um... I mean, it's really short notice. Oh, I know, but when you know, you know, right? True. And it's gotta be, like, perfect in every single way, including the perfect day. Jordan, I... Please! Look, I don't know how to explain this, but, uh, it's just, I'm... I've never been more certain about anything in my life. And I just want to tell the man I love that, as soon as possible. Sounds like it's meant to be. It is. OK. You know what? Why don't you text me your details, and I'll see what I can do? Excellent. Excellent. Thank you. Thank you, thank you! Thank you. I was wondering what was taking so long. Lucky number seven? Yep! I really need to learn how to say no. Uh-huh. Hey! You OK? I might have pulled something. - Oh no! - Yeah. Driving range hazards. I see a huge improvement, Simon, especially in your chip shot. Only you could turn a programming geek into a golfer. It's cause you're such a great teacher. Yeah, well, you know. I love your geekiness. I love you too. I better run. They're holding my spot at a Catan table. Would you mind dropping me? Sure. Sure. I just don't get why a computer guy gets so excited about moving little wooden pieces on an imaginary island. Feels good to flex the analog side of my brain once in a while. Right. Analog. Too many to choose from. Just choose one. The sentiment's all the same. Excuse me, but the wrong card could totally send the wrong message. You know? Mmhmm. Ethan and I have only been dating a couple months. No one's talking about love yet. All right, I get it. You don't want to come on too strong, but you want to let him know how much you care. Exactly. How about this one? "Valentine, how do I know we're a perfect match? Because you light my heart on fire." No? No. This one's pretty. "Love you forever and ever." Too much. What about this one? "Be my bestie, Valentine." Don't you think that's something you'd give to your friend? What's wrong with that? I mean, statistics show that successful relationships are built upon a foundation of friendship first, where the couple gets to know each other over time. What about love at first sight? Infatuation at first sight, yes. But that isn't the same thing as love. So you're saying that undeniable feeling when you first meet someone and it takes your breath away isn't love? I'm saying it's probably adrenaline. - Oh. - And hormones. Oh! Wow. How romantic. I'm all for romance. Buying a Valentine, aren't I? What? Nothing! Oh, look, perfect. A blank one. Write your own message. OK, I fail how to see how that's gonna be any easier than choosing one of these. It won't be, but it will get us home faster. Don't worry, I'll help you. OK. He was cute. - Who was? - Seriously? He was buying a Valentine for his girlfriend or wife. He wasn't wearing a ring. I checked. OK, that doesn't mean he's available. Maybe it was for his mom. Bree, stop. Can you please start taking your own advice? What's that supposed to mean? Piper, you tell all your clients that they should believe in love. You even told that stranger in a card shop! When are you gonna start believing in love again? Just let me get through Valentine's Day first. Piper... Here's my Valentine's Day wish for you. - That's not even a thing. - Shhh! Somebody comes along and takes your breath away. Adam! You made it! Ah, when my buddy calls, I answer. Ah, thanks. What's up? Sounded urgent. Mmm! Well, um, I decided to do something really special, and I want your take on it. OK... I'm quitting my teaching job to go pro. You think you're good enough. Totally. What do those golf pros got that I don't have? What does Simon think of all this? He's on board, 100%. Simon? He didn't know a putter from a pitching wedge before you met. Ah! Ah... Nice one. Gotcha. OK, what's this really about? OK, here it is. Um... I'm gonna ask Simon to marry me. Very funny, Jordan. No, I mean it. Come on! No, really. I've decided I'm going to ask him on Valentine's Day. Hey, buddy. Try to contain your excitement here. I... Sorry, it's just, uh... unexpected. That's what's so great about it. He won't see it coming. Hey, man, don't you want me as a brother-in-law? Of course I do, Jordan. It's just... You and Simon have been dating for less than a year. Adam... Don't you think it's a little soon for that? The way I feel about your brother, I don't need any more time. Well, what if he does? I do know Simon. And I love everything about him. Pretty sure he feels the same. I'm not arguing with that. You know, I knew you guys would be great together. I mean, that's why I set you up. Yeah! Right, see? This is technically your fault. All right, all right. I'm on your side, remember? Great. Hey, come with me to this appointment I made with a proposal planner? A what? It's a proposal planner. It's like a wedding planner, only she plans proposals. You... you need to hire someone for that now? Get with the times, bro. So, can I count on you to help me pull this off? You know Simon better than anybody, and I want this to be perfect for us, and for him. OK. I'm in. Nice! I like the enthusiasm there. Finally! A proposal planner... Hey, we shouldn't be too late. Piper, why did you keep those? I didn't realize I still had them. Actually forgot Greg and I used to have fun before he single-handedly ruined Valentine's Day for me forever. Greg broke up with you last year. That's just one Valentine's Day he ruined. It's up to you if you let him ruin the rest of them. Yep. You're right. I don't need these hanging around. Done and done! That's my girl! Hi! Hey! Gorgeous... Hi, Piper! Hey, Ethan! Oh, get this: I landed us a table at that Italian place you wanted to try. I may have bribed the manager, but it will be totally worth it for our first V Day together. Oh! I thought that we weren't gonna make a big deal about Valentine's Day, like just a... a card or whatever. No, yeah, of course. But gotta eat. Right? Right. Who doesn't love Italian? Exactly. - Yeah! - Yeah. - Yeah. - OK! Uh, we should go. Uh, the movie starts in 40. Let's go. - Bye, guys! - Bye, Piper! It's fine! You'll be fine. OK. Ugh... Oh, come on! "Happy Valentine's Day, Ethan." What else should I write? I don't wanna go too overboard. No, I get it, but you can still be honest about how you feel. "I'm so lucky I met you." It's perfect. Wait, should I sign "love" or just "Bree" and a heart? OK. You are overthinking this. Don't let the Valentine's Day pressure get to you. - I'm just gonna go with Bree. - Great! And a heart. Wait, what if he gets me a gift, and I don't have one for him? That client one of yours? Mmhmm. Cynthia! Come in! Come in, come in. I'm so sorry, did we have an appointment this morning? No, but, Piper, I need to talk to you. Of course! What's wrong? My mother says I'm humiliating myself by asking Brad to marry me, that he should be asking me. With all due respect to your mother, she's from a different generation. True that! There is nothing wrong with us ladies taking matters into our own hands. I know! But what if she's right? OK. Let's go to my office and talk about it, OK? Come on. So I'm thinking of proposing on the 18th hole. - Really? - Yeah. You expect Simon to last for 18 holes? Dude, you'd be surprised! His game is really coming along. If you're going to all the trouble of hiring a proposal planner, maybe you should listen to her ideas. Well... Although I still don't see why you need one. Because that's what people do now, Adam! You're... You've been out of the dating game too long. I date! Mmm, no, you first date. But when was the last time you second dated, huh? See? It's my line of work. I see all the pitfalls early. You gotta open yourself up to love, man. I don't want my best friend winding up alone. Well, listen, as your best friend, I just gotta say I can't help feel that a big showy proposal is gonna set things off on the wrong foot by raising expectations to a level that no couple can hope to sustain later on. Well, you said it. And this is me ignoring it. Just stick with the plan, Cynthia. Would you like me to book you a manicure the night before? Oh... I never bother. Working on cars all day. Of course. I'm sure Brad doesn't care at all, one mechanic to another. - Let's do it. - Yeah? OK. Thank you, Piper. It's my absolute pleasure. - Hi! - Oh, hi! Uh, we're here to see Piper. Oh yeah, it's... Oh, hi! Hi! Uh, did you end up finding a card? Yes, I did. Uh, but now I need to find a gift, so... Ah... Uh, yeah, just right through there. - Yeah. Good luck! - Thanks! Uh, hi! - Uh, bye. - Bye. Uh... Wait. You're the proposal planner? You're Jordan? Uh, I'm Jordan. Oh, hi! Nice to meet you. You two know each other? Well... We met at the card shop yesterday. Although we didn't officially meet. Uh, Adam Taylor. Piper Davis. You're obviously not Jordan's intended, or you wouldn't be here. I'm Simon's brother. Simon's your boyfriend? Yes. Uh, Adam introduced Simon and I. I asked him to come because he knows him so well. Oh! That's, uh, awesome. - Oh! - Here you go. Take a seat. So, uh, I offer a wide range of services, all the way from recording a digital proposal to staging elaborate events. So, what do you have in mind? Uh, OK, here's what I see: Simon and I are having a romantic dinner in a fancy restaurant, when all of a sudden, the wait staff and the other diners get up and do a flash mob song dance to... Love lifts us up where we belong Oh, and then I get down on one knee. You know, the 14th is in 5 days. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. OK, oh... - I'm just messing with you. - Oh! He does that. No, I know, I'm moving fast on this, so I am open to suggestions. OK. I tried to tell him he's rushing into things, but he won't listen to me. You'll have to forgive my buddy. He's romantically impaired. Yeah, I kind of got that impression yesterday. I recall saying I believe in romance. Just not love at first sight. Yeah. Guilty as charged. You know, it's his work. It has him focused on too many of the pitfalls. Oh, uh, what do you do? I'm an uncoupling mediator. A what? It's like a divorce lawyer with less fighting. That... is true. Oh. So the exact opposite of what I do. Well, I guess you could say that. Are you, uh, here trolling for future clients or... No, I'm here to help him. Mmm, yeah. Except he's against marriage. Are you? No! Only some marriages. Ah, OK. Well, look, I like to meet the intended before I come up with a proposal plan, so we're gonna have to act fast. Right... Oh, that should not be a problem, because Simon and I are having dinner with Adam tomorrow night. Come join us. But how are you gonna explain what Piper's doing there? I mean, won't Simon get a little suspicious when he finds out you're a proposal planner? He won't find out. I'll be undercover. Oh! Oh, I'm loving this. It's all part of the job. In the past, I've posed as a barista, a travel agent. I've even pretended to be a dog walker, and I am seriously allergic, so... So, what are you gonna tell Simon? You and I will be on a date. - Ah! - A what? That is perfect. We'll tell him that you two are dating. Mmm! OK, boom, done! Bye! Bye! We'll see you tomorrow at Chez Michelle. Yeah. It's a date. Say what? Uh, it's not what you think. It's a fake date. Sure. Strictly business. Oh, before you go, can I ask you guys a question? Sure. I'm deciding on a Valentine's Day gift for my boyfriend, just in case he surprises me with one. Would courtside seats to a Hawks game be too much? What? Yes, of course that would be too much. What about, uh, nosebleeds instead of courtside? Yeah, but then you might as well watch it on TV at home. Yeah, I don't want to look cheap, wait, or extravagant. Why not have a conversation about whether you'll exchange gifts? OK. What did I say? You can't just come out and ask. What, having to guess whether to get a present is some kind of test? Uh, totally, dude. Yeah. I mean, in my experience, that kind of lack of communication is a major factor in breakups. Mmm. Yeah, I guess you're right. Thank you. If you want to eliminate the element of surprise! Why is Valentine's Day so hard? Well, it's... No, don't say anything else. It's not a good idea. - Hey, Piper! - Mmm. We'll see you tomorrow night! Yeah, hold on. It's my address. You can pick me up. I can? Yeah, I live a couple blocks from Chez Michelle, so I thought we could talk about Simon on the way. That's a great idea. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Yeah. - Did you catch that look? - What? Someone has a thing for you. Were you not listening at all? We disagree on virtually everything. Yeah. Has the ring of a classic rom-com. Oh, rings! Oh, I forgot to ask him if he wants a ring. OK. "If you want to order Simon a ring, must order pronto." She was nice. She has a boyfriend. No, I meant Piper. Did you see the way she challenged me on practically everything I said? Yeah. It's 'cause she likes you. Hey, this is her. She wants to know, oh, if I plan on getting Simon a ring. I don't know. Do you think Simon would want a ring? I guess so. I mean, he still wears his school ring. Right. Yes. "Do you know a good jeweler?" It's her. She's on it. Man, she is top-notch. It's too bad you're not into her. Piper, Piper, Piper! Greg! What are the chances? I've, uh, been coming to this spin class for years. You know that. You know, I guess I forgot. What are you doing on this side of town anyway? I bought a condo nearby. Just moved in. Great! - Yeah! - Congratulations. Yeah, you know, I never pictured doing it on my own, but there you go. I did it. Great! You know what? That was my subtle way of trying to tell you that I'm still single. That's funny. So, uh, how have you been? Good. You know, busy. Right. Valentine's Day. How could I forget? Look, I'm not gonna get into this with you. I'm sorry. I... It didn't mean anything. I'm not that guy anymore. I promise. Well, enjoy class. Hey, mind if I ride beside you? Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's cool. Can it be a coincidence that he winds up in the same spin class? I don't know. He seemed pretty surprised to see me. Still, I mean, he shows up almost a year to the day that he broke up with you. Do you think this is too much? No! For dinner at Chez Michelle? You look... So, what else did he say? Are you kidding? I made a beeline for the exit as soon as class ended. Piper? What? - You're over him, right? - Completely. It's just... What? I wish I knew when I'd be over the hurt. That's him. I'll get it. I hope you guys have fun. I'm working. There's no law against mixing business and pleasure. Hello! Did I get the address wrong? Right address, wrong girl. Hi! So you two are... Roommates. You work and live together? And we grew up together. Huh. Friends for life. Which only proves my point. Which is? Strong relationships take time. Ready? Sure am. Thank you. I'll see you later. Have fun! Thank you. Tell me about Simon. He's a computer guy. Very talented. Uh, he moved from Silicon Valley about a year ago. That's when I introduced him to Jordan. Where did you guys grow up? DC. Both our parents work in government. - How about you? - Me? Where are you from? Oh. Indiana. How did you wind up here? Actually, Bree moved here first. She inherited the bridal shop from her aunt and convinced me to come work for her. So you used to work in the shop? Before I started my own business, yes. And here, I'm supposed to be interviewing you about Simon. Right. Simon. He's kind, thoughtful. Lives in his head a little bit. Jordan seems pretty outgoing. I guess opposites attract. Yeah, but they have a lot in common too. They're both fun-loving and they both love the outdoors, but in different ways. Hmm. Sounds like the perfect match. Uh-oh. - No, they're a great couple. - But? I just worry Jordan's caught up in a bit of a fantasy about this proposal. How do you mean? It's like he's writing a script for a movie, starring him and Simon. Because they're in love. Yeah, but love has to be grounded in reality, right? At least, I think so. You hungry? I am. Famished, actually. I was kind of nervous. Hmm. Adam, that's really not necessary. No, it's part of our disguise. After all, we're supposed to be on a date, remember? That's pretty romantic for a realist. Hey. Romance and reality don't have to be mutually exclusive. Jordan? What's up? Uh... I'm just, uh, curious about Adam's new girlfriend. Aren't you? The mystery woman. She must be pretty special if he's actually introducing us. Here they come. Hey! - Hi, guys. - Hey, bro. Good to see you. This is Piper. - Hi. - Pleasure. - Great to meet you. - You too. Adam's been keeping you a secret. Oh, what's a romance without a little intrigue, huh? And you know what a romantic I am. Yeah. Yeah. - That's sweet. - He's always making me laugh. So she's like, "It's on your chin," and I'm like, "Which chin?" So, how did you two meet? - Online. - Spin class. It was an online spin class. - But how did that work? - Hmm? The only people you can see on screen during a live stream is the instructor. Piper is the instructor. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh man, I am all about clipping in and pumping that swerve score. Right. What she said. But the one time you did a spin class, you hated it. All that work that got you nowhere. Uh, that was before I met Piper. Ah, it was hard not to notice this guy popping up on my screen, like, 3 times a day. Ah, I just couldn't get enough. But how did you know to join her spin class if you hadn't met her yet? Um, that's a good question. How did you? I, uh, watched a demo. But... Don't mind Simon. His favorite game growing up was 20 questions. - Mmm, fun times. - They were. You remember family game nights? Oh, how could I forget? Simon and Mom used to gang up on Dad and me at Scrabble. Do you like board games? Mmm. Mmm. He's crazy for them. He's a regular at this place called Board Game Bistro? I work with computers all day, so I prefer to go old-school in my free time. So you're a bit of a traditionalist. In some ways. Adam and I had such a great childhood growing up. I try and recreate that. I was an only child, so I was always envious of my friends who had brothers and sisters. Oh, I want at least 3 kids. Me too. Uh, what about you, Jordan? Uh, kids? To be honest, I haven't really thought much about kids. I mean, I'm a teacher, so I kind of get my fill at school. - To each his own. - Yeah. - To each his own. - Mm-hmm. Uh, speaking of Mom, I got her a Valentine card if you want to sign. Yeah. - What? - Huh? Nothing. Baby We've been wasting too much time And why am I only meeting this fabulous woman now? Ah, I guess I didn't want to jinx it. I'm sure we'll be seeing you again. Well, I certainly hope so. Goodnight, guys. Goodnight! Oh, uh... Well, I think we passed. Yeah. I think we did too. Ah. Feel like a nightcap? You know, to debrief? Yes. Why not? Mmm. So, what do you think of Simon? Simon. Um, OK. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess he was the fun one growing up? Hey! OK, that's about right. Ah. But you see what I mean about Jordan rushing things? They haven't even talked about whether they want kids. I mean, it's kind of fundamental. Well, you know. They say love conquers all, right? - Do you believe that? - Yeah! I want to, I just... I wish Jordan didn't have his heart set on proposing on Valentine's Day. Yeah. It puts a lot of pressure on you. Mmm. No, not just me. Valentine's Day puts pressure on everybody. It can make you feel so... Alone? I mean, not that you have to be in a relationship. No. Uh, no, obviously, no. I mean, who has the time, right? I've got a business to run, making other people happy. - Exactly. - So... But what about you? You're successful and, I guess, reasonably good-looking. Thanks. I think. I don't know. Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm too much of a realist. Well, everybody wants to be in love. It should be the easiest thing in the world. Why is it so hard? Ah, if I had the answer to that, I'd have to find another line of work. Oh, cheers to that. So, did you end up getting those Hawks tickets for Ethan? Ah. I'm still thinking about it. Uh, Valentine's is a few days away. I know, I know! I just have to think quickly. So, when are you gonna talk about last night? Talk about what? Your date with Adam! Oh, Piper! I... I learned a lot about Simon and Jordan. And, uh, what about Adam? What did you learn about him? Um... That Valentine's card? Yeah? - It was for his mother. - I knew it! I knew it! Look, he's a really nice guy, but we're so different. You just met him. How could you possibly know that? Well, he has about as much time for dating as I do, so... Piper, you have to make time. OK, I know how badly you were hurt, but Adam isn't Greg. At least he's got that going for him. OK! So give him a chance to break that Valentine's curse. Oh, this has got to be fate. - Good morning! - Hey there! I've never seen you running here before. Yeah, I usually go to spin class. It was getting a little crowded, so... So you actually do spin class? Yes, but I'm not an instructor. That was totally made up. - Oh. - Sorry, hold on. I'm sorry, I have to take this. - Oh, yeah. - Hey, Bruno! She wasn't kidding about Valentine's keeping her busy, huh? Yeah, it was like this last year too. I'll have everything ready. It's gonna be amazing, Bruno. That's OK! It's normal to be nervous. Yes, I talked to the supplier. Everything is completely organic and... I get the feeling it isn't her favorite day of the year. That's not true. What makes you say that? So I'm right. OK, put it this way: There are 364 days that she likes more. Any particular reason? Yeah. Everything is gonna be taken care of. We'll... I'll be there. It's going to be completely fine. I can't say. Can't or won't? You know another thing that makes relationships last? Respecting your best friend's privacy. Ah. I... Yeah. I mean, you know... It's true love It's true love It's true love It's true love That's it! Hey, bro. Running late? Oh. Literally. Ran into Piper while I was out on a jog. - She jogs? - Yeah. Plus she teaches spin class. How do you keep up with her? She keeps me on my toes. Maybe I should sign up with her. Uh... She gets pretty booked up. But she teaches online. There's always room online. I'll ask her. - What's... what's her website? - Uh, I'll send it to you. You know what? I'll look it up. What is her last name? Uh... Oh, you don't know Piper's last name? Peppy. Piper Peppy? Peppy Piper. It's her online handle. OK. OK. Uh... So last night was fun. Yeah. Piper's great. Ah, she is, isn't she? I don't remember the last time I've seen you so head over heels. Did I seem that way? - Maybe. More headed there. - Mmm. So what are the... what are the plans for Valentine's Day? - Uh, dinner, I guess? - You guess? Adam, if you don't have a dinner reservation by now, forget it. I don't think it's a big thing for her. You really want to leave that up to chance? I'll tell you what. I got a dinner reservation for Jordan and me. You and Piper can have it. - I can't ask you to do that. - No, really. I'll just cook for us at my place or something. Jordan and I are practically an old married couple anyway. He's really the one, huh? He might just be. But what about kids? You seem to be on completely different pages. Uh, last night, we talked about it some more, and Jordan said he thinks he can get used to the idea of kids. I mean, hypothetically. Of course. Hypothetically. I better get to work. You too. Ah, I had a cancellation. Someone decided not to uncouple? Yeah, I call it the Valentine effect. Giving it one more shot. Hey! Hey! Those are some really nice rings there. Yeah, the jeweler just dropped them off. She, uh, had to run to another appointment, so... That's a lot of precious cargo. You must be on very good terms if she left you with it. You know, for some reason, people trust me. Well, and I give her a lot of business, so... Good point. Oh, by the way, if the subject of spin class comes up, your instructor name is Peppy Piper. Peppy Piper? It's a long story. OK. Uh, so, listen. I've been working on some proposal ideas for Jordan, and I think I've got a really good one. Do I get a sneak preview or... Yeah! Because it involves you. Uh-oh. I mean, I don't have to sing or dance, do I? - Only if you really want to. - Ah, OK. What's this plan? OK, so Simon likes to hang out at that place, uh, Board Game Bistro, right? Yeah. You can find him there a couple nights a week. OK. And at dinner, he mentioned he likes board games. I don't know if a Scrabble shark's a thing, but if it is, that's my brother. Great! So, the plan: We lure Simon to the Board Game Bistro on Valentine's Day. That's where you come in. And when he gets there, Jordan is waiting with a word game. Once Simon answers all of the clues, it spells out "marry me." He'll love that. That's surprisingly enthusiastic for someone who thinks they're rushing it. Maybe I'm wrong about that. Oh? I saw Simon earlier. He's really in love. That's what I like to hear. All right, come on. - Hi, Bree. - Hi! Wowzers! That's a lot of rings. Uh, well, this one's quite popular with the gentlemen. What do you think, Adam? It's nice, uh, but a little too flashy for Simon. Hmm. Mmm, oh! This one. It's made of ebony. It's a sign of protection. Now, that's something he would really go for. Yeah, it's just a little too simple. - Yeah. - Right? Uh... Oh! I really like this one. Can I see? Um... I think this one's on special order. It wouldn't be ready in two days. This shouldn't be so hard. I should be able to know the ring right away. You know what? Let's switch paths. Um, I've come up with a couple proposal ideas for you. She's got a great one. Adam brings Simon to the Board Game Bistro. No. Uh... Nah. I don't wanna do it there. But I thought that that place was one of Simon's favorite spots. Well, that's just it. It's his spot. The truth is, and I'm ashamed to say it, but I'm a little jealous of that place. But, Jordan, there's nothing wrong with you guys doing your own thing. I mean, having different interests can keep things exciting. Yeah! But I have a really great idea that I think is gonna work wonderfully. OK. I take Simon golfing. We get to the 18th hole. "Will you marry me?" is cut out on the turf by a greenskeeper. Huh? No, that's a good... That's a good one. That's good! Yeah, no. No. I'm dead serious. No, golf is something we do together. Oh! OK. Uh, OK. Um... Yeah, if... if that's what you want, I will make the call ASAP. Mm-hmm. He'll love it. Uh, I'm really sorry to pressure you, but if you want a ring in two days, you're gonna have to make a decision. See, now I feel like I'm just guessing what ring Simon would want. Don't be so hard on yourself. It takes time to get to know someone. You know, some couples actually pick the ring or rings out later together. - Great idea. - Really? That's a great idea. Well then, why don't we do that? - Yeah. - Right? Good. Oh. Um, I gotta get to class. Piper, thank you. You coming? Ah, I'll catch you later. - See ya! - OK, bye. OK. OK. Uh, line up a golf course in two days who is willing to carve out a marriage proposal on the 18th green. I can do that. I can do that. No problem! You could just tell him no. I mean, your idea is way better. Thanks for saying that, but my whole business is built on making other people's dreams come true, and if that is Jordan's dream, I'm... I'm gonna make it happen. I know what would help. - What? - Coffee. Ah! I like how you think. Thank you! Piper! This is so weird! Twice in one week. Hi, Greg. I'm Adam. How you doing? Adam's involved in one of my proposals. Oh, so, uh, you're... you're popping the question? Uh, my friend is to my brother. Oh. That... that should be fun. Yeah, it is, actually. Well, your friend lucked out when he found Piper. Um... Hey, you remember when my parents came to town, and you mapped out a 3-day itinerary for them? It was the best trip they ever made. They say hi, by the way. Oh. Well, that's nice. Say hi back! Anyways, um... Just, Piper aces everything. Not without coffee, I don't, so... Oh, hey, uh, so... I'll see you around. Yeah. Yeah. - Nice meeting you. - Same. Let me guess. That guy is your ex. Oh, well, you sure know how to spot 'em. Must be all that uncoupling experience. That, plus I'm a guy. I recognize the signs. What signs? I don't know what happened between you two, but... he wants you back. Well, that's never gonna happen, so... Oh no! What's wrong? I'm sorry, coffee's gonna have to wait. Cynthia's in meltdown mode. She wants me there stat. I'm parked nearby. - You don't mind? - Not at all. Oh no! That looks like an idea better in theory. She had her heart set on it. Careful what you wish for. Cynthia... I can't move. I can see that. You got a plan B? This is never gonna work. How am I supposed to get down on one knee when I can't even bend my knee! OK, do you want to get it off? - Yeah. - Yeah. OK. Here. I got the strap. Easy does it. Easy does it. It was a really cute idea, though. This is a disaster. My mother was right. I should just be patient and wait for Brad to propose to me. But what if he never does? Cynthia, if I may ask, what made you want to take the initiative and do the proposing? Brad always says he likes the way that I know what I want and... and I'm not afraid to go after it. I like that about you too. Yeah, so do I. So, when you think about it, the only thing that's gone wrong is your costume. And I'm pretty sure Piper can fix that. You know what? I have a supplier who's doing a monogram box of chocolates that spell out "marry me." If we call right away, I'm sure we can get another box. Brad loves chocolate. And he loves you! I... I could tell as soon as I met him. What does Brad think you do? Brad, uh, thinks I'm a dog walker who sneezes a lot. Brad and I belong together. What does it matter who does the asking? That's the spirit. I can already hear those wedding bells. - Thank you, Piper. - Oh, of course. So... why did you get into family law? I find it satisfying. I help people make a tough time in their lives a little easier. Mmm. Even if it means going their separate ways? Well, everybody wants love to last, but sometimes, it just isn't in the cards. Oh, believe me, I get it. Greg? Obviously, it didn't work out. You know. I'm sorry. Oh, I'm not. We would have wound up in your office sooner or later. So, you were gonna get married? Uh, we were headed that way. What about you? Uh, did you ever meet anyone you were serious about? My job makes me a little gun-shy. So much that you'd rather be alone? Maybe. Sometimes. There was someone, once. She turned out not to be the person I thought she was. Hmm. Well... Love has to be worth it, right? You still believe that? Even after Greg? Yeah. Of course. Do you mind me asking what happened? Maybe we should just stay focused on Simon and Jordan. Right. To Simon and Jordan. I'll drink to that. No, I understand it's short notice. I just... My client is willing to cover all the costs to repair the green. Yes, you can call me back at this number. Thank you. OK. She'll check with her manager. Adam! Piper! Simon! What are you doing here? My friend from work is getting married. We're just trying on a bunch of dresses. The better question is, what are you two doing here in a bridal shop? - Uh... - Uh... It's not what it looks like. Yeah, no. What is it, then? Piper works here, selling bridal gowns. - Really? - Mm-hmm. This place has such a tremendous selection. I mean, isn't it so great? Oh! We think that it is the best Atlanta has to offer. You know? So you work here, you do spin classes... I mean, how do you find all that time? Uh... I just really like to keep busy. - Wow, seriously. - Yeah. By the way, Adam tells me your classes are fully booked up, but I'd love to get on a waiting list if possible. - Well, the list is really long. - It's... Yeah, yeah. I know what's going on here. - You do? - I do. It's the reason he's been keeping you so private from everybody. He doesn't want to share you. Guilty as charged! I want her all to myself. Oh yes, we just can't get enough of each other. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I... I remember when Jordan and I were like that. Mmm, yeah. Uh, Bree! Have you, uh, met Bree, my boss? - Pleasure! - Likewise! - Yeah. - Big boss. Yep. These two are brothers. - All our lives! - Yep, brothers. - That explains things. - Yeah. How so? Just that you guys are both really nice. And have beards. Yeah. Yeah, nice and beards. Oh. This yours? You golf? No, I just... I'll call them back. We thought we'd give it a try this weekend. - Yeah. - Oh. I mean, Jordan's been trying to get me into it, and it is so boring. Honestly, if I go the rest of my life without seeing a green, I'd... I'd be happy. Listen, my friends are heading out, but it was good to see both of you. - Ah, yeah. - I hope to see you soon. - What a surprise. - Yeah! - Take care, OK? - You too! Uh-oh. Yeah. Jordan? Hey! Fancy seeing you here. You too! I was just looking at dresses with that colleague from work that I told you about. Ah, of course! And you're not gonna believe who I ran into. Uh, Pi-piper? How did you know that? OK, I can explain. Yeah, don't bother explaining. Adam and Piper told me everything. - They did? - Yeah. I know all about it. - You do? - Yeah. Frankly, I'm a little ticked at Adam for being so secretive about the whole thing, you know? You are. Yeah. I mean, I understand being a little possessive when you have a great new trainer, but I'm his brother, you know? I think he can keep it in the family, at least. Uh, yeah. Totally. Adam, you know? What are you doing in this area? I thought you had class. I did, but I... Then I had a spare, and, uh, there is my favorite sandwich shop that is, uh, right nearby. Your favorite sandwich shop. Why haven't I heard of it? Let's go! I'm hungry. I can... Come on! What is going on with you and Adam withholding all of this information from me? I'm not withholding it so much as I'm... Ah, shoot. My meeting got pulled up this afternoon. I gotta run. Oh, man. Can I raincheck on that sandwich, though? - Definitely. - OK, good. - I love you. - Love you. You know, I think this could be my very first flop if we can't convince Jordan to change his mind about golf. That's on him, not you. Yeah, but I really want this to work. Do you get this invested with all your clients? No. Not always. There's just something special about Jordan and Simon. You know, I just met them. I feel like I've known them forever. I know the feeling. Hey. Whoo! That was close. I just ran into Simon. Yeah, us too. So I hear. The subject of golf came up. He didn't mention it. You didn't tell him, did you? No! No, of course. We covered. It's just, um... How do I put it? - He hates golf. - Yeah. That's not true. Last time we went to the driving range, he did really, really well. That doesn't mean he liked it. Do you think it's possible he's pretending he's having a good time to make you happy? No! He wouldn't do that. Not that know of, but... Would you reconsider going with Piper's plan? It... It's just... I can see Simon's face when we get to the 18th hole so perfectly. Maybe that look is relief? - Yeah. - I'm sticking with it, guys. Look, Jordan. I'm really sorry, but if that's the case, I'm afraid I can't help you. You're firing me? No! No. No, I wouldn't put it like that. I just... I can't be involved with a proposal that I believe could fail. Wow! Um... Well, that's your right. And I respect it. But I'm gonna prove you wrong! Jordan... I really appreciate your time. And it was really great meeting you, Piper. Same. Adam, I'm so sorry. I've never... I've never rejected a client before. You did what you felt you had to do. I think he's setting himself up for heartbreak. I know. I'll try to talk some sense into him. Sometimes I think about the good days we had But there were bad days too OK. Bye! What's wrong? Ethan just canceled our Valentine's date. I hope he had a good reason. He does. One of the other nurses at the hospital asked him if he'd swap shifts with her so that she can spend Valentine's with her husband. His company is sending him overseas for 3 months. That was kind of him. Yeah. It's so him. He said he'll make it up to me another night. But still, you know? I know. - Ah... - I'm sorry. Well, I guess that answers the question of whether to get him a gift. You know he could still get you one, right? Ah! You're right. Why don't you just give him something simple, like, I don't know, a gift card? Oh! That could work. The gift that says: "I'm thinking about you, but only this much." Plus, if it turns out he didn't get anything for me, I can just spend it on myself. Thanks, Piper. If only all of our problems were that easy to solve. Piper, you have planned hundreds of successful proposals. Don't let this one get to you. I know! Just Jordan and Simon are... were special to me. I felt a connection to them. You mean because of Adam? Mmm! Spending these last few days with Adam has been... wonderful. I am willing to bet that he feels the exact same way. Except I just rejected his best friend as a client, so I'd be surprised if he ever wants to talk to me again. I would be. Surprised, I mean. Are you expecting someone? No, not me. These are for you. Really? Do you think they're from Adam? Why would Adam be sending me flowers? Because he's totally into you, that's why! Oh. Not from Adam? Greg. Greg? What does he want? He wants to talk. Ugh! I am throwing these out. Goodbye. Ugh. Just as soon as they die. Hey, Piper? Adam, hi! I didn't think I would see you again. I... I hope it's OK I dropped by. - Yeah, of course! - Uh... Well, in that case, it's a beautiful day out there. Uh, brunch? I got some bagels, and they're still warm. I've never said no to a fresh bagel, so... Ah. I even got cream cheese. Mmm! Pulling out all the extra stops. I go the extra mile. Listen, Piper, I just... Oh. I'm... I'm sorry. Uh, George, is everything OK? No. Everything's not OK. Everything is terrible. Uh, what happened? I came up to the roof to practice for tomorrow and, uh, I dropped the ring. I dropped the ring. And I can't find it anywhere now. OK. I'll be right there. Another crisis? Ah, a runaway diamond! Well, I'm parked outside. Oh. Adam to the rescue again. I'm getting to like being your sidekick. George! Ah, Piper! Thanks for coming. Of course. This is my friend Adam. Don't worry, we're here to help. I looked everywhere. What am I gonna do? I can't propose without a ring. It has to be here. Even if you don't find it, you can still propose! Ah, it's not the same. Hey, I've met Lisa, remember? More undercover work? Uh, yeah. I pretended to be George's career coach. You gave me some great advice for Linkedln. Look, what matters to Lisa is you, not some piece of jewelry. I've met so many couples in my career, and I wish them all the happiness in the world, but the type of love that you and Lisa have? It's rare. It's the type that grows. Could you imagine telling your kids one day about how Daddy lost the ring and Mommy didn't care, about how nothing could stop you from proposing on this Valentine's night, from being the best night of your lives. - It would be a great story. - Yeah. - Sorry to ruin it. - Oh! You found it? It must have rolled way over there. - Oh, thank you, Adam! Oh! - All right. OK, this is a good sign. I'm glad you could make time for this. I mean, tomorrow's your big day. Well, today is more the calm before the storm, except for George, but... What about you? Don't you have any clients? These are my least busy days of the year. Nobody wants to talk about breaking up around Valentine's Day. So, what's the plan with, uh, George and Lisa? I hope it doesn't involve jumping out of tall buildings. No. But it is gonna be pretty spectacular. Are George and Lisa really a good match? Yeah! Well, I think so. How can you tell? The way he lights up when he sees her. The way she laughs at his jokes, even when they're not very funny. And I suppose in the end, love is just a leap of faith, but to be able to find someone you can share that feeling with for the rest of your life, it has to be worth it. It must be a good feeling, helping people find happiness all day long. Oh! It's my joy. You know, to witness that "yes," that perfect moment filled with so much hope and happiness, pure love. That's why I had to say no to Jordan. I just... I couldn't watch his dreams be crushed. I know. Guess not every couple's meant to be. Like you and Greg? Well, for a long time, I thought we were. What changed your mind? Last Valentine's Day. I was just starting my business. Greg went ahead and made these huge plans, even though I told him I was gonna be busy. We got into a huge fight. He accused me of putting my business before him, which wasn't true. Giving someone your heart shouldn't mean giving up on who you are. Tell that to him. He broke up with me. On Valentine's Day? I mean, it was for the best. He wasn't really willing to give me the freedom to let me be me, so... When we ran into him yesterday, I got the feeling he wanted to make it up to you. What am I doing? Rooting for the other team? - There are teams? - Oh yeah. I'm team Piper all the way. OK... Well, in that case, uh, since you're not gonna be very busy tomorrow, I could use some help. Count me in. Gotta get me some of that joy. When you find a love Once in a lifetime Someone to cherish Happy Valentine's Day! Same back at you! Pancake? Oh, yes! Thank you. Cute! What's going on with you? Nothing! I'm just riding that Valentine vibe. Any particular reason? No. Oh. That'll be Adam. Say no more! Did I not tell you he was coming to help me today? Ah, no! Weird. No, not at all. - Hi! - Hi! Come on in. Part-time Cupid at your service. Cute. Total rom-com vibes. Sorry? I was just asking Piper why she's so happy. Why wouldn't I be happy? Nice! From your boyfriend? Mm-hmm. Ethan! I thought you were working a double! I'm on my way. Oh, hi! We have to get going. - OK, good luck out there! - Thank you. See you, Ethan. - Ah. Hey, I'm Adam. - Good to meet you. Nice roses. So? Who's first? - Cynthia and Brad. - OK. I, uh, just stopped by to give you this. Oh! I got you one too! Oh! I heart you too. I am the lucky one, babe. I, uh, also got you this. I got you one too! I got you this. I really hope you like this. OK, you go first. - The Hawks? - Yeah. My team from my girl. I really like the sound of that. - Open yours. - OK. Oh, Ethan! That's so gorgeous. Ethan, I... Bree, there's... Uh... I just wanted to tell you that I'm really into you. I'm really into you too. The beat of your heart Running through my chest Maybe you guessed You're where I want to be So make the moment last Here, let me help. Oh, thanks. There's Cynthia. You ready? Yeah. But I'm super nervous. You'd think I was the one proposing. Well, in a way, we are. Now you see why I'm so involved in my work. - There you are! - Right on time! Here are your chocolates. How are you feeling? Like my stomach is full of spark plugs. Which is totally normal for someone who's about to propose. OK. Where's Brad? I send him to get coffee and donuts. He wanted to know why I was wearing nail polish. - He'll find out soon enough. - Yes. Right! Hey! What's going on? Aren't you the dog walker? Yeah! Uh... I was just dropping off keys. Oh, I'm with her. Brad. I got donuts, so what's with the chocolates? Will you marry me? Say something. Uh... I didn't see that coming. That's it? Uh... No, yes! Yes! Yes! Wherever you are, I'll be there too 'Cause wherever you go, I wanna go there with you With you Whatever you dream, we'll make it true No place is too far I wanna go there with you With you With you I wanna go there with you I wanna go there with you I wanna go there with you I wanna go there with you Each city we'll leave will lead us to A brand-new world I wanna go there with you With you With you I wanna go there with you I wanna go there with you I wanna go there with you I wanna go there with you That never gets old. After a year of planning proposals, I can legit say that's true. Sure beats sitting in my office watching relationships fall apart. Yeah. That must be hard day after day. Ah, by the time they get to me, the worst is usually over. Although, believe it or not, sometimes I succeed in bringing couples back together. Isn't that bad for business? Yeah. But it's great for karma. It's Jordan. Hey. Uh, OK, OK. Slow down. What happened? OK. OK. I'll talk to him. Yeah. What's wrong? He and Simon had a fight. Oh no. They broke up. On Valentine's Day? Freebird How will you fly when the autumn wind... Simon, hi! Thanks for meeting us. I suppose you talked to Jordan. Yeah. You guys broke up? Kind of. Kind of? Si, you owe it to Jordan to make your intentions clear. Adam, I need you to be my brother right now. I don't need you to be a divorce mediator. OK. But you should know he's pretty upset. Yeah, breaking up is not what he wanted. It's not what I wanted either. So what happened? He just kept pushing me about going golfing, and it had to be today. I told him that's not how I want to spend Valentine's Day. I was gonna surprise him with a great meal at my place. But did he know that? No. Communication. I shouldn't have blown up about the golfing, but I don't see him making the efforts to do the things that I like to do. And that's what made me so mad. But I do love him. Like crazy. And now it looks like I'm gonna be spending Valentine's night playing Catan. Ah! I'm so sorry I didn't listen to you. It's OK. Look, you were stressing. I get it. It's all for nothing now. I'm not so sure about that. Jordan, Simon's in love with you. And I'm pretty sure you can persuade him to go golfing again. Just not on Valentine's Day. Look, you have to be able to show him that you're interested in his world too, right? And that your love is strong enough that you both can just be yourselves! And that you're willing to spend the rest of your lives learning about each other. Yes. Yes! I... And I can do that. I'm willing to try anything. So we go back to Piper's original plan at the Board Game Bistro. I mean, he's gonna be there tonight anyway. Right. Is there time, though? We'll make time. The plan is in here. I have to pick up a couple things for George and Lisa's proposal, so you guys have to go to the game store and pick up the board and the game tiles. They're expecting you. Oh. You got it. We'll take care of it. OK. Piper, I don't know how to thank you. Hey, hold off on that until he says yes. - Piper! - Greg? I know. I know. Please just listen to me. We're not getting back together. There's nothing left to talk about. Yes, there is. I need to tell you how sorry I am for the way I treated you a year ago. You didn't deserve that. Look, uh... I know, it's over between us. And, uh, I promise to leave you alone from now on. This doesn't say if the bistro knows we're coming. Uh... OK. Uh, maybe we can still catch Piper. Let's go. I just want you to know that you were the best thing that ever happened to me. Goodbye, Greg. I really hope you find happiness. I really do. OK. Hey. Come on. We can check with the bistro ourselves, right? Yeah. This is so Simon! I'm sorry about Piper, man. Don't worry about it. This is your night. You should talk to her. Find out what's going on with her ex. It seemed pretty clear. - Hey! - Hey! Is everything ready? Yeah, uh, the manager says Simon's reservation is in one hour. OK, that's perfect. Uh, I will be here as soon as George proposes to Lisa. Piper asked me to get champagne, just in case they don't have the good stuff here. They probably don't. Why don't we go ask them to put it on ice? Wow! This looks terrific. Jordan seemed pretty pumped about it. It was a great idea. Is... is something wrong? I saw you with Greg. I'm happy for you. Oh, Adam... Those roses, they were from him, weren't they? I can explain. You don't have to. Look, it's obvious he's crazy about you. Yeah, uh... He wants to get back together. We talked about it, but... You guys were together for a long time. There's history. I get it. I can't compete with that, and, frankly, I don't want to. You... Adam, that is not what's going on here at all. Piper, it's OK. People have second thoughts. It happens all the time with clients. Except I'm not one of your clients. OK, the bubbles are on ice and we're... I have to go. Wait, but you'll be back before Simon gets here, right? I don't, Jordan. I don't really think I'm needed here anymore, but good luck. Well... Woah! What happened? Buddy... Oh, Lisa just texted. She's on her way. That's perfect. I'm almost done setting up. Piper, you OK? Yeah. Everything's fine. I envy you, George. You found your soul mate. Hey. Yours is out there too. Thought so. Close your eyes. Close your eyes and picture him. We've got a proposal to get ready for. Oh. Thanks. Half hour to go. We're good. Nervous? Yes. Yes, I am. But, um... but I'm excited too. Mmm. If this all works out, you'll be my best man. Sure. Jeez. Oh, although Simon's gonna want you to be his. Oh yeah. I'll do double duty. All right. So that's it, huh? What do you mean? You're just gonna let her get away? I know how this story ends, Jordan. I've seen it often enough. Just because you've been hurt in the past, doesn't mean it's gonna happen again. You gotta fight for her, man. If she's the one, you gotta let her know. This is the time to start thinking with your heart, not with your head. Ah, Lisa's on her way up! - This is it! - Oh! Hi. George... Why did you want to meet up here? It's a perfect night. It is. The city looks so beautiful from up here. Not half as beautiful as you. That's so sweet. Not half as sweet as... Lisa, I love you so much. Make me the happiest guy alive and marry me. Oh, Georgie! Yes. Yes! I love you. Ah, OK, uh, the night's not over. How does, uh, dinner and dancing sound? Perfect. Best Valentine's Day ever! That's what I said! After you. It's OK I know someday I'm gonna be with you It's OK I know someday I'm gonna be with you George? Oh. - Hi. - Hi! Piper, this is... incredible! OK, here it is. I... I've never felt this way about anyone before. - Adam... - Please. Just let me say what I came to say. I was an idiot before. I... I should have listened to you, trusted you, but I let my ego get in the way, and for that, I'm sorry. I may be about to make a total fool of myself, but... a very smart woman I met recently says that love is worth taking risks for. Well, a very wise man once told me that communication is key. Hmm. That is wise. Sometimes, you gotta follow the heart over the head, don't you think? You know, for once, my heart and my head are in complete agreement. Uh... It's Jordan. He wants to know if we're gonna make it back in time. Well, I mean, I am his proposal planner. We can't miss the main event. All right. Ah! - OK. OK. - Last one! It's gonna be good. How do I look? - You look great. - Yeah? You promise? - It's gonna be great. - You promise? OK. - Oh, hi! - Hey! Hey. I see you two have finally found each other. Uh-huh. - We have. - At last. Jordan. Why are you here? You two are supposed to be at dinner. Uh... We'll... we'll explain later. Jordan, what's going on? Play the game and find out. How does it work? OK. Uh... I give you a clue, you fill in the answer. The point is to see how well I know you. OK. - You ready? - OK. - OK? - Yeah. All right. First word. What's your favorite lunch? Easy. Ramen. That's what I thought. OK, that's one. Ready for clue number two? Five down. OK. What's your least favorite yogurt flavor? Cherry. Yes, I got that one right. Oh, I'm good at this. I'm impressed. You are 0 for 0. OK. Four down. What's the name of your first dog? That's cheating. You asked Adam. I swear, you told me when we were hiking in the mountains last summer. Remember? Mumford. Mumford. Ding ding. OK. I'm impressed with that one. Let's see... OK... With your M-R-Y. M-R-Y. Mar... Marry? Simon. Oh, Simon, I... I love you more than I thought it was even possible to love someone. And I never ever want us to be apart, so... Oh... Will you marry me? Oh, please say yes. Yes! Yes! - You said yes! - Yes! He said yes! Yes! Oh! Congratulations! Yeah, we're so happy for you guys! You two were in on it the whole time? Uh... we have a little confession to make. Jordan actually hired me to plan this proposal. Adam and I only pretended to be dating. But now... Say no more. - Should we celebrate? - Yes! Well, my final Valentine's Day proposal. Not quite. Could I propose dinner? Yes. All right. Cheers! - To love! - To love! - And Piper! - Oh. Come on. What are you gonna get? Actually, I took the liberty of pre-ordering for both of us. What are you up to? Just learning from the master. I hope you like peppers. I love them. Thank you. It's just pizza. No. For giving me back Valentine's Day. I thought I'd lost it forever. And now? It's better than it's ever been. And I don't want it to end No, I want to fly there again 'Cause nothing else seems to matter When our hearts beat together Oh, I want to kiss you again I swear your lips are the sweetest Let's get high on the feeling Oh, I want to kiss you again When you lean in The rush begins And I can hardly breathe In your eyes I'm in paradise A place made just for you and me 'Cause nothing else seems to matter When our hearts beat together Oh, I want to kiss you again I swear your lips are the sweetest Let's get high on the feeling Oh, I want to kiss you again 'Cause life can be A little crazy
