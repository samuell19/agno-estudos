LOOKING BACK, YOU REALIZE EVERY COINCIDENCE IS INEVITABLE… You won't find me here. I haven't arrived yet. I've just come to take a look. This is where I will be born. My name will be Louis. The hardest part was choosing my parents. At least, I thought that was the hardest part. They have to meet first, which is easier said than done. Why? Follow me! That's Eric, my dad. Quite handsome, don't you think? No, that's not my mom. That would be too easy. That's Anna. She'll also have kids, three, in ten years, with a guy she's known forever. Hold on. Would you like to see him? There he is. They'll be a good match, don't you think? Should we go and see my mom? I warn you, it's a bit of a trek. Seatbelts on everyone. Let's go. That's her, Catherine, my mom. As soon as I see her, I go all soft inside and just get so excited. We're done with the introductions. I'm going back to where I come from to wait and send them little signs, which they may or may not notice. The rest is up to them. Which is what I'm worried about. Hello? Mr. Slansky. No, hold on! I sent them back home only once. One time! Could you be out on scaffolding in the freezing rain all day? Okay, I'll be expecting you. Come! There's another that won't last long. Why are you dressed up? We're going to my parents'. Thirty people are waiting. Oh shit! Your uncle's ceremony! - My dad's. - Yes, of course, your dad's. These are… I totally forgot. Fucking thing. Hang on. Eric, please. I'm coming. It's the same color as the carpet. Thanks very much, miss. Who's next? Hello. I'm going to sing "Tout pour un seul homme" by Maurane. Have we got your details? Right. Well, of course, family jewels. When's the next one? The day after tomorrow. I was really bad. It was awful. You'll be fine. Don't worry about it. Now, what do I want? Poached salmon. 137 francs. The menu looks really interesting. Poached salmon. So you don't want… Excuse me, waiter. I've got no money. Did you forget your checkbook? No. I've just got no money. So what now? You can search all you like. I haven't a cent. I'll need to see your ID. I don't have my bag. Follow me, please. We're going to see the manager. - Can I help you? - No, thank you. Some help you are. Police, please. This is crazy. It is crazy. Go on. Get out. Thank you. Bet she's not even poor. You really are an idiot. Wait! This is my place. Good evening. Good evening, Gino. Consuelo Bella! - A friend. - Evening. Two pizza royales and a carafe of wine. That's the second time I've done that. The first time was less of a risk. I was with my 85-year-old aunt. Where do you live? In a tiny studio flat. Stylish but cheap. And what do you do? I write music and play the piano. But what I love is what I do least. Singing. No way, really? Me too! You're a singer too? Where? At home, mostly. I earn a living by being a stereotype. Consuelo at your service. Isn't that right, Gino? Si, bella. I'm a flamenco dancer in this little tapas restaurant. I get paid in tips. Every now and then I get to sing a little. John! Come here. I want you to meet Catherine. She's a singer. John's a musician. Anything with keys. I also sell my voice for ads, jingles, and I fail every audition. My mom's the only person who thinks I'm going to make it. My parents never believed in me. That might be better. I would have loved to be Spanish. Stamping my feet for no good reason, singing, dancing. There's no humor, just heart. Adding humor to the flamenco would be like talking about AIDS in a musical. And why not? I like when music is like real life. Chance encounters, opposites attracting, the clash of personalities. When I like a guy, and I mean really like him, I get nosebleeds. Nosebleeds? Picture the scene. We're fooling around, and then bam, my nose starts bleeding. The poor guy is rubbing my back with ice cubes while I'm bleeding all over my new dress. Know what? Some guys like that, because it's different. Please, allow me. There you go. It's screeching. It's supposed to. Screech? Will you take Benny out? Are you listening? Life stops when you play. Yes, that's exactly how it is. Are you taking Benny out? Now? It's pouring. Ten minutes or he'll be blocked up. We'll see about that. Benny, come here. Go to Mommy. Go on. Shit, the rain. You stay there. - Hello? - Christian? It's Eric. Eric, no way. Where are you? Where do you think? Prague. What have you been doing? Suffocating in silence. Listen, that offer you made me, does that still stand? I just got the boot from the project. What about Anna? What will she think? It'll only take ten years to convince her. Especially if I've lost the dog. I'll call you back. Benny! A dog? Benny! Come here! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What are you doing? Your audition was unsuccessful. Here's your cassette. This isn't what we're looking for now. Hi. Come in. Thanks very much. This place really is tiny. It's cheap. Who is this? My mom, ten years ago. Your mom's a singer? She was. Tuna in your salad? It's my mom who sends me them. She says, "When you're not rich, you have to eat rich food." When she was trying to make it she ate so badly she caught scurvy. Did she make it? No, she never made it. Offenbach. Like that? No, let's rap. Okay, onto the serious stuff. Take a look at that. Azur Bar is looking for a female singer and a waitress. Thanks. - We should go. - No. You found it. Come on. There'll be at least 50 of us. They do want a singer and a waitress. It doesn't look so seedy. No, just ancient. Shall we? Thank you. Good night. Are you here for the audition? The stage is all yours. For your accompaniment, talk to The Beatles. Your turn. - That was great. - Thank you. Thank you. - I was awful. - Right. It's like throwing yourself out a tenth-floor window. I was happy with that. You can start on Saturday. If you're interested, I still need a waitress. I'd rather die. Travelling to Paris is hell, but living there isn't. I'm sick of packing up all the time, always on the move. This is wrong. So what are we going to do? Empty the washing machine. - We have to wait. - For how long? Five minutes. Not the washing. I mean us! If it's not dry by tomorrow... You want your laundry? What are you doing? Eric, stop! It's all good. Eric, come back! You drowned the dog! No funny faces today? Where were you? In there. Since when? We love your funny faces. I think my favorite one is… I like when you fix your hair too. What do you do apart from that? Do you know the Azur Bar? Is that the one with the bad singers? Yes. I work there. - Okay. So you're… - A singing waitress. Fancy a drink some time? Sorry. I don't drink with customers. My name's Julien. What an idiot. What an idiot. Yes, I know. Try listening. I won't do it again. It's not just that. Come here. It seems like, as soon as I turn my back, you're up on that stage singing stuff no one's heard before. They're my own songs. Listen, here, the customers, the Belgians, the Japanese, want the classics. Stuff everyone can enjoy. Do you get me? Loud and clear, boss. What are you having? That was great, by the way. Here for the bad singers? I'm actually here to apologize. Shit. Shit! You need to let him breathe. Perfect timing! We need ice cubes over here! - Sit down. - Head back. This is going to feel cold. More air! You'll be fine. It's clearing up. I'm sorry. It took me a long time to decide to write to you to tell you that I have decided to go to Paris without you. Farewell, my companion. That's all we were really. We were companions, but we didn't share very much. It's no one's fault, my dear Benny. We don't speak the same language. And that makes it hard to understand each other. I'll leave you to your moist carpet. Too many of my dreams died there. Tell your mom I did once believe and that her kindness did me a lot of good. Now the music is taking me far away from you, to battles you wouldn't like. Tell her, above all else, that I tried. Really stress that until she believes it. I tried. PS. Remember what I taught you. Loads of mom's friends have silly plants. Cut it out. Hello? Aline, guess what? Eric? Are you in Paris? That's right. Then come visit. Of course. Right. Okay. Well, I never. That was… Yes, I heard. Is he just visiting? No. He's back. With what's-her-name, Sonia? Anna! I don't know. He didn't… Yeah. What about the music? Is he still playing? I guess so. Don't start, Pierre. Eric was smart enough to understand he didn't have the talent to make it. It was about pride, not talent. It was soloist or nothing. And then he ends up in construction. It never made sense to me. I know. Which is why he never came back. Did he mention me at all? Or the music conservatory? - Not a word for his old teacher? - He's coming tomorrow. He told me he'd bring flowers. Just make sure you follow those directions. Okay? I'm counting on you. See you tomorrow. I'm sorry. What was I saying? I'm sorry. Christian Vedel speaking. You phoned at just the right time. I'm sitting with my new partner right now. I'll pass you over to him. It's just the hall and the corridors. Piece of cake. Plus, it's a concert hall. Hello? Yes, Mr. Bauman. The plans for the hall? I would say… We haven't got them. …we'll need them. Schedule a meeting. When can we meet? Tomorrow? Yes. At eleven o'clock? That's fine. - Make it noon. - Could we make it noon? All right. Perfect. Goodbye Mr. Bauman. How about that? We really need to make some changes. Number one, we're not trendy. You can say that again. I never know about any of the cool places. We've got no connections. We're ambitious, but only with what we like, which nobody else likes. I can't help it. No matter what I sing, it sounds like flamenco. We need a band. Instead of giving our songs away, we could keep them. I don't know. "Shut up and write," is that it? - I didn't say that! - But you thought it. I'm a crappy singer, aren't I? You're not exactly Barbra Streisand, but… But what? You never finish a sentence. What is it I don't have? Confidence! You're a good singer, a good dancer. And where does that get me? Your songs touch people, Catherine. Maybe more than that. You saw it the other night when we tried your new one. Yeah, but you were singing with me. I'm fed up with cold sores every audition, canned tuna, and nothing but rejection, year in, year out. You want to know the truth? There's just nothing special about me. I can't wait to tell my mom I'll never perform at a big venue in Paris. I love singing. But when I'm alone on stage it's like I'm too self-conscious. I can't lose myself at all. You don't have to sing alone. Sing with me. We could form a duo! A duo… What good would that do? We've got no money, no equipment, no producer. All we need to start is a vocal duet with strings. A friend of mine can play synth. We can work out the rest later. A duo… Sing it with me. My God, how boring is this job? Mr. Berthier, excuse me. Could I see you a minute? Mr. Vedel had a motorbike accident. What? Is it serious? He's at Cochin Hospital, room 222. That's all I know. Hello. - How is he? - Weak. He's asleep. Wake him up gently. Christian. I'm here. Can you hear me? - Who are you? - You're not Christian! There was a mix-up. I'm sorry! How is Mr. Verdier? Different. Very different. - But you're fine! - How am I fine? That was a brand-new helmet. Destroyed. The rear wheel's fucked. The mirror's in pieces. The frame's badly damaged. That's not nothing. Maybe, but compared to earlier. You should have seen room 122. Not a pretty picture, let me tell you. Bandaged from head to toe, eyes bulging. What are you going on about? I thought this guy was you, but it wasn't. - Which guy? - A guy I'd never seen before. He was in a really bad way. Eric, did you get a bump to the head? Everything okay? Huh? I'll tell you later. I need to go. You're looking well. That's good. I'll be back tomorrow. In the meantime, don't change rooms. It's not good for my nerves. See you. This seems wrong. It'll be fine. They don't use their basements for anything. So are the clocks going forward or back? Did they not say on TV? - They said an extra hour in bed. - That means they're going back. But then we'll be an hour behind. So we'll sleep an hour less, not an hour more. It must be forward. No. If you go forward an hour then tomorrow night it'll be dark an hour later. Putting the clocks back makes the days shorter. Think about it. That's what I'm doing. If the clocks go forward then tomorrow night it will be an hour later. So sunrise is later? No, it's earlier. That doesn't make any sense. So we get more daylight? You're not listening to me. Think about the sun. What does the sun do? I'm not a child! Forget the sun! Will I get more sleep or less sleep? One hour more. We can stay up an hour later! Cut it out! So if I set my alarm for nine o'clock. It will actually be ten o'clock. But that's one hour more. - Exactly. - What do you mean "exactly"? This makes no sense! You have no sense of logic. I've got no sense of logic? Take an hour off tonight, add it tomorrow… - I never said that. - Get up earlier. - Earlier at night. - That's correct! - But why? - That's another story… You, pick a side! Tonight, forward or back? I'm confused. You see? I say it's forward. If it's 11 now, I make it midnight. But the clocks are going back. So ten o'clock? In that case, I'm going to bed. We can't keep doing this, singing for Jesus and the saints. You're right. It's not much of a crowd. Where then? In the metro? - Azur Bar? - The boss would say no. Let's not ask him! We'd invite all our friends. My brothers and sisters, we are here to accompany Jean-Pascal to his final resting place. Ubi est mors victoria tua. Death, where is your victory? Your hand can take nothing from this wise man… from this wise man because… because your only domain is time. Lord, hear our prayer. Open your ears to my voice. So that man will fear you. Louder! Please excuse me. What are you doing? - Flamenco dancing. - In the middle of a funeral? I thought I heard something. It didn't bother you, I hope? Not before noon! I told you, never before noon! See? I told you the clocks were supposed to go forward. Sometimes I believe in fate. This is disgusting! I just used what I found. A bit of chicory, some decaf, and this diet thing Greta left me. Ultra brewer's yeast. Is this what the ladies get? No wonder they never stay. Plans for the morning? One of Aline's friends, John, has a friend who's leaving an apartment. Cheap, but tiny. I'm going to see it. Your cello can go outside. Do you not want to stay here? Since you're here, let's put the tree up. John's pal who's visiting the apartment is really running late. Let's not wait. Put the key under the mat. Is it not a bit early to move in with Julien? You can't imagine living with someone. I have before… and I loved it. - For five years. - You? When? Who with? In Saint-Denis. When I was 15. With my boyfriend. At 19 he left for some rich girl 12 years older than him, and I stayed in Saint-Denis, in an empty studio. Do you think because you had a nosebleed he's the one? It might not work out. We're missing the tip. - Huh? - You know, the bit at the top of the tree. Chloe must have taken it with her. You give them a tree, they run off with the tip. They're all alike. Long live the single life! Where are you going? To buy a tree. It really only snows at Christmas in films. You know, I read an interesting article about the brain. You're having a dopamine spike. - What? - Dopamine. It's a molecule produced in the brain which stimulates adrenaline. You're stimulating my adrenaline. Give me a hand. It upsets the part of the brain that controls logic. Jump up and down. The limbic system takes over. Shit. It's only when the molecules enter the cortex that you control your own decisions again. So should I tell Julien that I have to wait for my dopamine to enter my cortex? No, but… Then give it a rest. Look who's here. What do we do? We keep going. But we could... I don't care. NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT AGENCY What's that? The number 86. Hold on. Something's not right. Excuse me, do you need a ticket? Of course. Well, that's a day lost. Why didn't they say anything? - Who knows? - It says there. When do they close? I'd come back tomorrow at 8:30 a.m. On Friday, Sylvette's at window B. She's the best. That one there's a total bitch. Let's come back tomorrow. I'd rather the bitch now than Sylvette at the crack of dawn. But Julien will be in a huff. I promised to do a painting later. So things aren't perfect? No, it's worse than that. You know what I've realized? What? - He's got no spontaneity. - How do you mean? Okay, here's an example. When he says, "I'm dying for a bit of chocolate," he goes into the kitchen, opens the packet, and takes out one square. And the thing is, he never goes for more. What a weirdo! You must argue all the time. That's the thing. We never argue. If there's a problem then we talk it out. There are no raised voices or slamming doors. You can't stay with a guy like that. - That's for sure. - You were right. I was too quick. I need to be more like you. No ties, always someone new… - Dumping guys… - Or being dumped. "Always someone new" is an exaggeration. It's hardly the Bastille Day parade! Excuse me, are you that group… Le Douo? That's right. I was at Azur Bar with my husband. - Really? - It was great. It was John who invited us. My husband was his music teacher. What do you do? I'm a set designer. I just finished working on a film. I'm having a party soon for my 20th wedding anniversary. You could come with John. - Thank you. - That sounds great. Give me a call. That's me! - See you soon. - Bye. By the way, you really should dump that chocolate guy. What? It's 2,000 francs a night to rent the room? For 90 people? Any off-season reductions? You seem to draw a distinction between the concept of fate and destiny. That's right. Everything has a fate. Even a plant has a fate. But destiny implies something exceptional… - Something grand. - Determinism? I wouldn't call it determinism. I prefer to think of it as internal logic. For God's sake… It has nothing to do with chance. We are definitely guided in series of events in our lives by... Are you all right? I'm fine, but did you see what was in the trunk? Shit! I can't believe this. It's ruined! And I'm on my way to rehearsal. You're in that quartet, Voinel. Yeah. Do you know how much a cello like this costs? Try and guess! I can't believe this. A Bailly like this one? 250,000 francs. - I'll get it repaired. - My cello! I'll go get you mine. Stop, thief. Stop, thief. Could I stay to watch the rehearsal? You won't even know I'm here. You idiot! My dress! We have to wash it right away. Come with me. To the bathroom. Hurry. Come on! Oh! You caught us. - Come here, you! - How's it going? Was this you? No! Some clown bumped into me. Let's try salt on it. No, it's white wine you want. Mustard as well. Do you know Greece? No. - I'll just go home. - No. I'll go to your place for another dress. - Any preference? - The red one. Here it is. Aline, where's the bathroom? Straight ahead. Excuse me. Eric! This is Aline's director. Just a couple of minutes. Excuse me, in a hurry here! This is Eric Berthier. You need bleach and coarse salt. It's either this or nothing. In fact, I wanted to say. Take this. I'm going away for two weeks. Where are you going? Getting rid of this. Two days in hospital, couple of days of rest, and this summer bikini time. That's what you think. Next thing it'll be your stomach, your knees, your arms, your eyelids. I'm getting my eyelids done next Friday. - The bottom ones? - No, the top ones. Why? - What age would you say I am? - 54. Bitch! - How old is she? - 54. Can we come visit? Absolutely not! It's top secret. I'll be "at my mom's." Wait! My button's stuck. Ouch! - I'll be back. - No worries. I can't see anything. Don't come in. I'm naked! I've got it. It's fine. Thank you. Where is Consuelo? In the bathroom with Catherine. What's she doing? But anyone could walk in. Where do you want them to go? I'm off. - See you soon, darling. - See you soon. Bye. Look at you! That friend of yours… You get used to her. Two seats in the front row? You can have the whole row. - Feeling better? - Yes, thank you. - So? - Thirty's not bad, is it? - It's good! Excited? - Yeah! I just want to pay you back. Forget about that. On you go! Break a leg! For our first time on TV. Castanets! Where did you find them? Hold on. I'll put them on. Paella! - Wow! - Looks fantastic! Those sorts of impulses, guys have no control over them. Absolutely. Now we know that it's an illness. Nobody would have a go at someone else for having cancer, would they? We're talking about child rapists here. Did you see them on TV? Drop it! I'm not pregnant. Maybe for the best. That really hurts! What happened? I bit into something hard. - Didn't you cook the rice? - I did. Shit! But these are... Castanets. They're fine. Relax. These things happen. Castanets in paella? Yeah, all the time. - She nearly broke a tooth. - Did you? You see? I don't get you. You say nothing about child rapists, but when someone nearly breaks a tooth, you lose it. We weren't judging the guy. We were talking about impulses. And that stops you from reacting? I'm lost here. Try thinking about the victims! Feel something! How can you be so cold? We're not judging… - Thank you. - There it is. You're not judging. We're all becoming so politically correct. Let's not judge anyone. Tell people you don't like your concierge and it's a scandal. It's all about understanding, analyzing, putting things in perspective. But really, people don't care. You think you're open-hearted, but nothing seems to bother you. You never challenge anything! Where's your anger? If you understand people's impulses so well, then you won't mind if I get impulsive and do something really stupid. You see this chicken thigh? What are my impulses telling me to do? Cut it out right now! This is crazy! You see? You're not trying to explain now! That's enough. - Let go of me! - You'll just hit me back. I won't. Just let me go. - You promise? - I promise. That's disgraceful. And you're a coward. Where's my test? Get your castanets. We're going. You really went for it there! And what do you do other than bawl and shout? He's got some nerve… He's right, but it's better than nothing! That was the agreement. It's been that way for five years. If that happened, if I were you… - No one is irreplaceable. - It's a bit fickle though. No, it's not. We've hit a snag. Paul can't do the tour. How come? I'm joining an orchestra in Brussels. So what now? I'll play the first concerts in Paris, as we were just saying… then get someone else. Is this a joke? Eric, we've heard you. We know you're good enough. And you've been at every rehearsal. Mr. Berthier? I have a meeting. But you're crazy. What about my job? No. No. - Mr. Pieu. - It's Lieu. - Lieu. Have a seat. - There are no chairs. I'll go and get some. - Did you find someone? - In two minutes? No. We'll audition. Good idea. Forgot the chairs. Hello. Here are the chairs. That's kind of you. We needed some. Yes. I'm Ms. Brandouly, a lawyer, here for Mr. Lesure. Are you... Not at all. I've got a meeting with Mr. Lieu. Pieu. No, thanks. I don't drink. I do. Some say the better it is, the less they drink. I'm the opposite. Château-Beychevelle '82. Wow! Will we tell them? Tell us what? We found an apartment. We'll move Monday. - Already? - Quick, huh? Well. Here's to you two! To you two. You can tell us your story now. Yes, of course! Right, so, my concierge, always sick, poor thing, always goes on about her "sintrom." And what is that? "I'm better, but they can't seem to stabilize the sintrom." I never had the guts to ask her what it was. I looked in a medical dictionary but found nothing. Then I thought, maybe I've got a sintrom. It might not be stabilized. She was always going on about it. The next day, all casual, I ask her, "Mrs. Prieur, how's your sintrom?" "Don't start! I threw it out again." And then I realized it can't be an organ. I know what it is. But you can keep going. That was a real bomb. Excuse me. I have to take this. Hello? Good evening. Yes. - It wasn't intentional. - You sure? It's a client. It's important. You can tell the rest of your story now. Right, well, she takes me to her quarters and says to me, "Look, I'll show you." I imagined all sorts of things. Like her pulling up her sweater to show me some horrible lump, or some strange growth on her scalp. Awful. She goes over to the kitchen and opens the fridge! The sintrom was inside? I thought she was going to bring out a jar with a sintrom swimming around in it. - Get to the end. - Oh, right. From the fridge she brings out… We're still on the "sintrom." Ah, yes. It's a blood thickener, isn't it? Are you coming to get me from the airport tomorrow? Yes. Well, that was a bit of a disaster. But what can you do? These things happen with first encounters. She's nice! "Nice"? Why not "great" while you're at it? - I think… - Go on. That she's the perfect antidote to Anna. But not necessarily the one. I think you know that. I wish the two of you weren't quite so honest all the time. Don't you want coffee? Not anymore. At least let me see you out. Aline, when I first saw you, I thought… - Cut it out. - No, I want to hear. I thought you were a snob. - And? - I was wrong! No you weren't! I am a snob. And I can be condescending too. You don't get it. She makes me feel alive again. She's free. She doesn't depend on anyone or anything. She's so full of life, and I feel the same way. She gives me wings. Well then, fly. He'll come back. He always comes back. Bloody hell. I can't get through to her. I've barely seen her since we moved in. That's how it is with these high-powered women. Not worth it. Eric, we are supposed to be working. Lieu has suggested a velvet covering. Who? The set designer. - Pieu? - Lieu. Velvet? Right, that's fine. But before you said... Excuse me. Are you looking for someone? I'm looking for the quartet, Voinel. Where do they rehearse? I'm Lebon's replacement. Follow me. Wait there. Make yourself at home. I'll go let them know. I'll be right back. Eric, have you seen a cellist wandering about? Yes. Me. Stay right where you are. I'm your man. Sorry. They want to see your cello first. Come on. Let's get going. Hey! Don't tell me you're leaving already? I'm sorry. I need to be in Bordeaux tonight. Didn't you get my message? I did! I'm so happy for you. This is a last-minute thing. My clients want to appeal. We'll celebrate another day. Okay, I'll freeze this. Look, Eric, I don't have a choice. You know that. Living with me... But I don't! I live with your suitcase! Whichever one it is that you leave behind. But we both agreed at the start we would respect... Each other's freedom. I know. I wanted to live with a woman with passion, not with her perfume and her pumps at breakfast! Wait. What if I cancelled Bordeaux? Would that really change anything? Would it change my life? You don't want it to change? No, I don't want it to change. I can get someone else to go instead of me. You should've taken the big one. Aline? Were you asleep? It's only ten o'clock. I had a migraine so I went to bed early. Everything okay? I'm getting dumped. Beat her to it. And be the one who leaves again? Never. When I left Anna I'd have given anything to swap places with her, to be reading my letter. Aline? I'm listening. If with each new love we look for what was missing before… when will it end? Perhaps when we stop looking. Oh, and Aline? Yes? - Can you freeze taramasalata? - Bring it for lunch tomorrow. Bye. Could you watch him for me? - Yes. - Thank you. Someone's feeling the urge. Oh, hi there! Tell me about it. It's been this way ever since I turned 30. Thirty is so young. Are you coming to the concert at the Louvre on Thursday? Eric's pals. - Whose pals? - My friend Eric, the cellist. After Julien I told myself in a couple, passion has to be the dominant force. Now I know that passion can't be the dominant force. So now what? So nothing. One day you'll meet someone, move in together, put your head on their shoulder and stop thinking such things. Yeah, but when you still believe in true love at the age of 30, is that a good or a bad thing? People wait a lifetime for what you just described. Consuelo can't leave the married guy she's seeing. Then there's me… And all these single women around us. When did you meet Pierre? When I was 35. - And now you're... - Healthy with nerves of steel. That fools everyone. Consuelo! Three times today! Three times! It's all arranged! A 15-date tour for Le Douo! - Congrats! - And that's not all. We're planning a big concert in Paris in May! What? They make me think of a quartet. Some place, huh? Pierre! How are you doing? Excuse me. What are they doing? - Hello? - Hello, is that reception? No, who do you want to talk to? Backstage, please. Hello? Yes, but I'm not... Who is this idiot? Backstage, please! I want to speak to the cellist, Paul Lebon. Are you ill? How did you guess? Look, if you can't connect me with backstage, then someone who's at the concert. Is it busy? Yes. - How many people? - I don't know. Between 100 and 500, roughly. - What? - Hello? Pardon? Are there people on the sidewalk? Why not in the trees as well? Listen, miss, you're being deeply unpleasant. There's some lunatic on the phone. How dare you call me a lunatic! Give me someone normal! Look, I am normal. You've been going on for ten minutes, and I've had it up to here, sicko! You silly cow! Impotent! That's it, I'm going down there. - It's me, the sicko! - I'm sorry? - The impotent! - I don't follow. Cat got your tongue now that I'm here? Look at you with your huge gut! Like a worm that swallowed a meatball! That's enough! Say it again for everyone to hear. Are we going for dinner after? Let's get a move on. That's my daughter! Thank you! Thank you! Bravo! Girls, that was incredible! Hello. All I can say is wow! I think I'm in love. Since when? The day before yesterday. His name's Martin. He's great, not at all like Gilles or Julien. A friend of mine once said, "If with each new love we look for what was missing before, when will it end?" Come to think of it, how have I never introduced you and Eric to each other? Who? That must be Martin! This calls for a dinner party. There it is. Quick, a tissue! Come here. Give it to me. What's wrong with her? It's just the nerves from being on stage. A big surge of adrenaline and then… Tilt your head back. And what is it you do? I do spiritual formation at a Buddhist center in Porte de Pantin. Sounds fascinating! I didn't know you were interested in Buddhism. Take this, darling. Thanks, Mom. I need to go. I'll see you later. Will you be okay? I'll be fine. Bloody hell. Why does this only happen to me? If you keep this up you'll die. You'll have no blood left by the time you meet the one. Aren't you sweltering in that wig? Not at all. I like it. I didn't have time to wash my hair. To the Buddha of Porte de Pantin! I need a taxi. Shit, I haven't got any money! I'm in for a telling off here… - Hello, Aline? - Yes? Could you come pick me up? What's the emergency? - I'll tell you later. - What are those noises? Martin doing his sun salutation. What? I'm on my way! However much you might want to believe, when you see your guy at 5 a.m. in his pajamas, blowing into a goat horn, you know this isn't the father of your kids. Why not? They'd find it funny. Are you on a new diet? Are you worried about your weight? Oh, you know, it just creeps up on you. Some mornings getting old just seems too cruel. Anyway, I cracked. I'm getting my eyelids done. - Where? - Baudeloque Hospital. I was a moron. But you know how it is. It feels so good to be happy again that you make yourself believe. Come on. Forget about the Buddhist. The right person's out there for you. You're right. Maybe in order to love someone, you need to make room for them. Baudeloque Hospital. - Hello? - Yes? Hi there. Could you put me through to cosmetic surgery? We don't do cosmetic surgery here. Really? So you don't have an Aline Peraud there at the hospital? Peraud? One moment, please. I see she's in oncology. Is that right? I can't put you through. She's still in surgery. Thank you. Aline… Hello, I'm looking for Aline Peraud's room. - 440. - Thank you. Catherine? - Pierre! - Catherine. No, she can't be… How could she go so long without saying anything? She was convinced she would get better. And you coped all alone. I wasn't all alone. I had her. We didn't notice. She was losing weight, wearing scarves, wearing wigs, and we didn't notice. She was a strong woman. You're strong too. That's what she used to tell me. I need to phone Eric. Consuelo? He came back. Alain? He left his wife? Yes. - And you're crying? - Then he left again. - What? - He said it was for his daughter. - How old is she? - Thirty. Will you stay with me? Of course! We're going to Pierre's. I don't want to see anybody. He wants to introduce us to Eric, his best friend. You go. Let's compromise. I'll take you to Gino's, then we'll meet them for dessert. It can be very long, and we don't know why. Perhaps it's to hide real code, like a draft. It's nearly 11. She's late. She'll be here. …in the Bible, with this idea that the Good Lord… Did you know that Le Douo… Excuse me… Did you know that… Le Douo are planning a concert with a trio and they need a cellist. Seriously? Are they holding auditions? On Tuesday morning, I believe. Tuesday morning? Shit, I think I'm busy. I'd love to work with them. - They're great. - So you're a cellist? - You're a musician? - Yes. Have you seen the latest research on response curves? Do you recall? It's electronic... Excuse me. Is your friend not coming? She shouldn't be long now. She's quite elusive, this friend of yours. Are you sure you passed on Tuesday? Passed what? Your driving test. Why? Am I going too fast? Thirty. Thank you. - How many more? - Two. By far the best. Thank you. That was great. He's cute too. I don't think anyone else is coming. See you at the restaurant? Is the bathroom there? Anyone in there? Excuse me! The audition? It's finished. It was from ten till 12. - But it's 11:20. - No, it's 12:20. Shit! The clocks went back. - What time is it? - No, I'm not getting into that. - But what's the time? - I'm not getting into that. It's 12:20. Okay, let's hear you. Go on. Get yourself set up. - Get a move on! - I'm going. Calm down. Shit. It got stuck. I brought sheet music. No, we'd rather you improvised. Improvise? Please. Right, well… This is a real pain in the ass… So just improvise? - Yes, exactly. - At 12:20. Okay. What's she going on about? Okay. I'm ready. That's it. I'm done. Let's all go home. Hello. - Catherine? - Yeah. I'm Eric. Eric Berthier. I'm sorry. Auditions give me a rash. Me too. I'd be literally disfigured each time. So why make people audition? As a musician you must know how hard it is to improvise. What other way is there of hearing your music? - You could come hear me play. - It's not the same. - That'd mean watching a whole concert. - That's unfair. Much harder than just sitting there and judging. Okay, I'm off. Why are you so unpleasant? I'm sorry. It's my fault. What's worse is that I love your music. See you. Aline and Pierre always said you were nice. - Pierre's too sentimental. - Aline wasn't. With Aline, towards the end, did you… Know something was up? Not at all. Me neither. I was oblivious. Me too. That's one thing we share. Yeah, we're both idiots. Pierre seems better. He's talking about her again. Aline was something else. And she had it all. Well, almost. I don't know. You can be happy without kids, can't you? Do you think so? No. I just remembered something. I was talking to Aline once about some guy and she quoted you. It really struck me. What was it again? "If with each new love we look for what was missing before, when will it end?" - I said that? - Yes. It's very insightful. Have you still got split ends? - I'm sorry? - Split ends. When the ends of your hair get dry, brittle, and frayed. Aline couldn't... Right, got it. Aline said you had no time for that sort of... Nonsense. Exactly. You're more into underlining philosophical quotations, reading Paulo Coelho, full of oriental wisdom… - Are you Buddhist? - No, why? There are some really nice ones. Not in Porte de Pantin. You might be right. I don't spend much time there. - I have my mom's hair. - I heard she was a good singer. What's wrong? Nothing. I thought I had a nosebleed. Do you get them often? Yeah, when I'm… It's a stress thing. It's just us two. I love empty concert halls. Provided I'm not playing to one. Right. As a boy I got nosebleeds for big events… like the day of an exam, or the day before we went away on holiday. Or when a pretty girl sat next to me. That's crazy, right? Absolutely. I think if someone were to ask me if I was hungry, I would say yes. - Are you hungry? - Yes. Shall we? You have a dog? No, this is Eliott. He belongs to the caretaker. Do you not like dogs? No, I love dogs, but only really big ones. It's 11:45. Shall we go? It's 12:45. Yes, the clocks changed. So forward an hour? - No, back an hour. - Forward. No, back! Think about it. I have. It can't be back. - The radio said... - The clocks went back! No, the clocks have gone forward. I swear, you've got this wrong. We can't go back an hour… You've got it all wrong. Think about it!
