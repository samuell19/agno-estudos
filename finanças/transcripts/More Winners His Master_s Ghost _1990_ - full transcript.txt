[thunder crashes] [rain pours] [overlapping chatter] - Goodbye, Mom! [upbeat piano music] [children chatter loudly] [thunder crashes] [wolf howls] [thunder crashes] [eerie music] [water gurgles] [girl screams] [boys laugh] - Well, you scared her to death! - Hey! What are you two guys doing in the girls' dormitory? - Um, just helping Sara and Greta with their bags. - Yeah, so I see. You're supposed to be in the Great Hall anyway, so come on. Get a move on. [overlapping chatter] [claps] - Good evening, and welcome to this, our fifth annual music camp. Once again this year, we have with us some of the finest music teachers in Australia, and as I'm led to believe, some of the finest students. [students chatter] So, work hard, enjoy your music, and make the best of your opportunities. Those of you who've been here before will know the rules, but I'll go over them again for the newcomers. Most importantly, the dam and the caretaker's cottage are out of bounds, as are any other buildings other than those that we've been allocated. The girls' dormitory is out of bounds to the boys, [students groan] and the boys' dormitory is out of bounds to the girls. And finally, I'd like to have a word about the ghost, variously described as a ax murdering maniac or the creature from the old dam with two heads and an outboard motor. [laughter] Well, I can tell you all that there is no ghost. [students groan] Disappointing, I realize, but there you have it. So, I don't think there's anything else to be done except get on with our music. [kids shriek and mimic howling] Why did I mention it? - Ah, they'll settle down in a while. There are worse things than ghosts, you know. - What? - Theory classes. [laughs] [exhales sharply] [sniffles] - Take it. [shrieks loudly] [boys laugh] - Gotta hand it to ya, mate. [boys laugh] - Do you all have to make so much noise? - Aw, good one. - He's right, he's right. Look, I'm sorry, mate. My name's Colin Esh. My friends call me Flea. [buzzes] [gasps] [boys laugh] - All right, you lot, come on. It's lights out. You got a big day tomorrow. I'm glad to see someone's taking it seriously. - Please sir, can I have an aspirin? [boys laugh] [choral music] [orchestral music] [plays repeated tympani notes] [music stops] - We're not interrupting anything, are we? - No, sir. - Would you like to play it as a solo or play along with the rest of us? [students chuckle] - All right, then. Let's take it from the pick-up to bar 81. [light orchestral music] [off-rhythm tympani notes] [music stops] And the winner is... [students laugh] What are you doing now, making up for being late last time? All right, we'll take a five minute break. [class cheers] While! Tympani swats up on his music. And violins... [students groan] We'll look at bar 88. [mumbles] Hey Flea, when you have time, you can't read music. [girls screams] - It's not real, it's plastic. - It amuses you, does it? - It was during break. - According to Mr. Gwyn this isn't the first time. - It's not my scene, all this classical stuff It's boring. - It's not, if you give it a chance, Colin. You're self-taught; you're gifted. But there's more to life than garage bands. Look Colin, you have a wonderful opportunity here. You can waste it if you want to, but I cannot have you disrupting the other students. Do you understand? - Yes, miss. - Back to your music. - How's it going? - We get one every year. He'd much rather clown around than work. - Seize fate by the throat, boy. - Weird. [chuckles] [blues piano music] - Who's that? - I don't know. He keeps staring at me. - What a creep! - [whispers] What are you doing? - [whispers] Exploring. Wanna come? - No thanks. I'm busy. - Oh, Sara. Don't you think of anything else? - Not if I can help it. Watch out for the ghost. He walks at night. - Oh, grow up. [laughs] [ominous music] [water dripping] [glass breaks] [cat mewls] [grunts] [Flea screams] [laughter] - Just thought we'd keep you company, mate! - Come on, let's get out of here. [mimics ghost] [cat purrs] [upbeat orchestral music] [screams] - A rat! [students scream] - What do you think you're doing? Calm down! Stop it! - Well, been through your compositions, very impressive. And very long. Doesn't anybody just write love songs anymore? [class chuckles] What's this? Jason. Why didn't you hand this in yesterday? - I didn't think you'd understand it. - Oh, and now? - You might as well have a look. - Just a minor work, is it, Jason? [class chuckles] - Now, if we take it from bar... Ah, our caretaker at last, Mr. Bretherton. We seem to have suffered an infestation. A rat. Somehow, it found its way into one of our instruments, an appalling state of affairs. - There are no rats here. - What? - I mean, there is nothing for them to eat. - Then what's this? The ghost of Christmas past? [students chuckle] Now, where were we? Bar... I'd be grateful if you'd dispose of it, Mr. Bretherton. I have enough distractions as it is. Now, if we pick it up from bar 71, and violins, please. Sforzando and fortissimo. [orchestral music] [students chatter] - He was marking you. He did it! - How could he? - I don't know, the way he looked at me! I thought I was a goner! - What if he tells Miss Jonas. - Nah. - He's looking at me again! - Who? - Oh, the creep. Hey Greta, I think he wants a date. - A rat, Mr. Gwyn? - As thick as your wrist. - We have to sterilize everything. - Sounds like another prank to me. - And you know, all that old fool could say was there were no rats in the building. Well, who put it there, the ghost? - You don't believe those stories, do you, Mr. Gwyn? - Of course not! But the children do, and that's the problem. - If you like, I'll have a word with them. - Thank you. I'm quite capable of administering my own discipline, Miss Jonas. If it was a prank, you can be sure it won't happen again. - I was gonna put it in the dam, like a hand coming out of the water, but let's put it near the girs' dorm instead. - When, tonight? After lights out? - Why not? - Yeah, why not? [owl hoots] [ominous music] - [whispers] Get off! [shushes] [Flea chuckles] - [Mrs. Keane] Come on, girls. Lights out. Good night, girls. [girls chatter] - [Flea] I don't think they can see us! Come on, Sara, look up here. [intense music] Put your face up here. [stammers] - What? [boys yell] [owls hoot] - What the hell was that? It was the ghost, wasn't it? - Don't be stupid; it was the caretaker! - Carrying an ax! Why was he carrying an ax? - I don't know! [woman screams] - It's all right; it's only me. - How silly of me to make such a noise. - I was lopping a branch outside the window. Mrs. Keane said it was keeping her awake. - It's just that I came in and saw this man with an ax. - What's wrong? - Just a little misunderstanding. - We thought someone was being murdered. - Scared me when I saw him. What are all these ghost stories anyway? - Ah, this place is supposed to be haunted. Dates back to when it was an artist colony. I think the stories came about to keep people away. - Mrs. Keane believes every word of it. - I wouldn't be surprised. What are you reading? - Concerto for Piccolo, Pop Group, and Orchestra by Jason Pengalli. - Any good? - Well, it's either a work of genius or utter rubbish. I'm damned if I know which. [ominous music] - [Flea] Well, has he got it? - [Martin] I can't see. - [Flea] We've got to get that arm back. - I'm not going into his graveyard. - Martin, you can't, Martin, wait! [music intensifies] Martin, wait for me! Martin! - [Girl] He was just standing there with this enormous ax. - [Flea] Did he have anything else? - [Girl] What? - [Flea] Well, did he have a severed arm. - Get real, Flea. He was chopping off a branch that was banging on Mrs. Keane's window. - Perhaps he gave it to Mrs. Jonas. - No. - What are you two on about? - Flea thought he saw a ghost last night. - Oh, what an idiot! [upbeat orchestral music] [loud rhythmic tympani tones] - No! No, no, no! You're at least a beat late. Tympani, you come in with the rest of us at letter B. Look at it! Can't you see? - Yes, Mr. Gwyn. - [Mr. Gwyn] Let's try it again. [music resumes] [class cheers] Bravo, tympani. - Well done, Flea. - Bravo! - Now, the last day concert. What do we think about the original compositions? - Well... I think the symphony is quite exceptional, given the age of its composer, a little primitive, perhaps. - We all agree on the symphony, then? - What about the other piece? - [scoffs] Oh, you have to be joking. Concerto for Piccolo, Pop Group, and Orchestra. Whose orchestra, may I ask? - Well yours, we'd hoped. I can provide the rest. - But it's utter nonsense. - I admit, it's got it's problems. - Problems? - But I think it deserves a performance. - Well, I'm sure I don't know. - So, I get the casting vote. - Well, you gotta admit, it's original. - It's nonsense. - Well, I rather liked it. - What? - And I suppose you'll be doing some more work on it, Mike? - Of course. - Have you read the solo? It's unplayable. You'll need a virtuoso. - I agree, and we'll change it. - Let's rehearse it anyway. If it's not up to scratch, we can drop it. - Thanks. - The composer's got a right to find out. - But it can't be changed. It's crucial to the entire piece. - Look, I had to battle to get it this far. Don't push your luck. - I'm the composer; I know what I want. - Jason... - [Jason] It's a question of integrity! - Look, the piece is virtually unplayable! We're limited by our resources. - That's not my problem! - Well, of course it is! If it doesn't come up in rehearsal, the piece will be dropped from the concert. - All right, then I'm gonna have to decide which is more important, the composition or the performance. - Yes, Jason. - Flea, Flea, wake up. It's Sara. - What? - I was supposed to meet her an hour ago. - Don't you think of anything else? - But she isn't there. Something's happened. We were supposed to meet here! - Why so close to the old man's house? - [Martin] So we would get caught. - [Flea] Oh jeez, Martin! - I checked with the girls. She's not in the dorm. - What do you think's happened? - I don't know! [owl hoots] [ominous music] [Martin shushes] - What? - [Martin] What was that? - I don't know! [loud creaking] [music intensifies] - What do you think he's doing? [creaks] - We've got to get help! - Wait, what are we gonna tell them? - The truth! [Flea screams] [music intensifies] [Flea screams] [Sara laughs] - We got you! [Martin laughs] - Mr. Janovic, Mr. Janovic. - Yes. - I've rewritten the solo. - Great! - For violin. - What? - There's a girl in the orchestra; she's very good. She won't find it that difficult. - Jason, you've hardly changed it at all. - Yes, I have. It's for violin. - Jason, come on. - You said I had to take our resources into account. So I have. - Now, the second piece of music, if we can call it that, is a different matter entirely. The pop group elements will be provided by Mr. Janovic's class, while the rest, unfortunately, is up to us. The unenviable task of the solo is to go to Greta Thornsen. - Greta! - Good luck, my dear. You'll need it. I won't pretend that I approve of this so-called composition Decomposition I think, might be a more accurate description. However, we are going to treat it seriously. Well, as seriously as we can. In the meantime, however, the sanity and sanctity of Beethoven. Bar 23, please. With feeling. [soft orchestral music] - It's just signed with initial L. Did someone slip this under your door? - It was there when I woke up. My first thought was Mr. Gwyn, but he's married. - It's a very childish hand, Mrs. Keane. - You think it was one of the students? - Well, we've had our fair share of mischief. - A practical joke. [sighs] It's not a very nice thing to do. - No. No, it isn't. - "My immortal beloved." I was touched. [intense orchestral music] [Flea screams] - Get off me! Get off me! [class laughs] - You! [chuckles] - You can't help yourself, can you? And don't pretend it isn't yours. Colin, Mr. Gwyn said the other day you were perfect. How can you play so well one day and then waste everybody's time the next? - I dunno. - And what about this? "My immortal beloved, my angel, my all, my very self. "Wherever I am, you're with me. "What is life without you?" - What is it? - It's a rather infamous love letter by Beethoven. Somebody slipped it under Mrs. Keane's door last night. - And you thought it was me? - It's in the library. It wouldn't have been hard to find. - [Flea] It's not even my writing. - Isn't it? - How would I do it? - Why do you eat spider sandwiches? Any more trouble, and you're out. [discordant violin notes] - [whispers] It's impossible. - [Janovic] She's nearly got it. - [Gwyn] It sounds awful. - [Janovic] Give it time. - Greta, let's try it without the orchestra. [loud violin notes] [students chatter] - Greta, Greta! You saw him, you saw him! - [Greta] Who? - The caretaker! - Yeah, just before the solo. It was weird. He nearly put me off. - Put you off? It's how you go it right! - Get real! - Same thing happened to me! - What do you mean? - You know when I played like that the other day? It wasn't me, Greta! - You can say that again. - It's the old man! It's like he's got some sort of, some sort of power! - It finally happened; his brain's fallen out. - Flea, I'm afraid, is an idiot. [violin music] [clears throat] - Oh, hello. - Greta, I'd like to thank you for the solo today. - [Greta] Thanks, thanks for writing it. - I knew it was good, it just took someone to show them. - Would you like to join us? - No thanks, I don't play games. - Oh. - I'll see you tomorrow, okay? - Jason, Jason, wherefore art thou, Jason? [smooches] - Stop it! - Hey Flea, what are you reading? - Oh, just this book about Beethoven. - What? - Immortal Beloved. It's about this woman he loved and the letters he sent her. They're really hot. What a weirdo he was, ranting and raving about the place. He was as mad as a meat ax. - Never thought I'd see you reading about the masters, Flea. - Yeah, neither did I. [eerie music] [scream] [pants] [gurgles] [Flea breathes heavily] - [whispers] L... V, B. - Flea, what happened last night? - Flea, what's going on? - He saw something last night. He's just not talking. - [Sara] Why not? - You wouldn't believe me! - Come on, you lot. Hurry to class. Colin, can you take this mail the caretaker, please? - Yes, Miss Jonas. - [Gwyn] Come along, you two, you'll be late. - [Flea] Ludwig Von Beethoven. L.V. Bretherton. [harpsichord music] - Oh! You gave me a start. - Mrs. Keane. You know most of the stories about this place. Do you believe them? - Most of them, no. It never was an ax murderer, for instance. - Or a ghost? - Many, many years ago, we used to have a Beethoven festival here. One year, so the story goes, there was a pianist, a very fine pianist who was so obsessed with the Master's music, that he changed his name to Beethoven himself, and he went on to win the festival. He was brilliant, quite sensational. Then, for some tragic and unknown reason, he went and drowned himself in the dam. He's buried in the churchyard over there. And some say that his ghost has never left here. But it's just a story. [discordant orchestral music] [music stops] - Well, you heard it. It was appalling. - I've never heard it played so badly. - Don't blame the players. It's the music. - You've got to admit, it was pretty awful. - It's a terribly difficult piece. - I simply refuse to conduct it, and that's that. - Sure that's what we're here for, to encourage experimentation, innovation. Look, we can't take it out. - The choir could do another item. - The program's too long anyway. Mike, I'm sorry. [choral music] - [Greta] Jason. Jason! I'm sorry. - Look, it wasn't your fault, okay? You weren't up to it. - I was the other day! - Yeah? Not when it counted. - Poor old Greta. She thinks it's her fault. - Supposed you'd done the caretaker. - Cheer up. It was a revolting piece of music. - In the olden days, they had a Beethoven festival here. It was won by someone with the same name as the composer. Afterwards, he drowned himself in the dam. The caretaker's got the same initials as Beethoven, L-V-B, and he's got the hots for Mrs. Keane, who had one of Beethoven's love letters pushed under her door the other night. And the only time I've ever played properly was when he was there to watch. Same thing happened to Greta, but she won't admit it. Beethoven suffered from liver failure. He'd swell up so much that doctors would have to cut him to relieve the pressure. And last night, I saw the caretaker walking around in the moonlight streaming like a sprinkler system. But I wouldn't believe me if I was you. I don't believe it myself. - [whispers] Hey, wake up, wake up. - What's going on? - [mumbles] - [mumbles] - Yeah, I know. - [Sara] Martin, come over here. [overlapping chatter] - Oh, I think I'm going to be sick. I ate too much. - Flea, why don't you tell them about Beethoven's ghost? - [Sara] Yeah, go on, Flea. - What was that? - [Sara] What? [door creaks] - Someone's coming! [shushes] - Quick! Quick! Hide! [overlapping whispers and shushing] - Anyone for pizza? [students laugh] [Bretherton shushes] We wouldn't want anyone to hear, would we? I was sorry to hear about your composition, but don't worry. They wouldn't know. And you, you will play better tomorrow. - But... - A great musician wins his audience with his genius. He doesn't grovel for approval. He doesn't need it. Those critics, what do they know? Never trust a man whose only contribution to music is his opinions. His instrument is a monotone. And that is not music at all. You. You have done a lot of reading. Tell me, who was it who said to a performer who complained that his composition was unplayable, "Oh, but it's not for you." - It's for another age. Beethoven. [chuckles] - Hello. - Good on ya! You're a good sport. - What? - You told the kids? - About what? - Leaving in the Concerto. - I don't know what you're talking about. - It's in the program. - Didn't you type it again? - Of course I did. I changed the opening number, remember? - Thank you, Miss Jonas. We won't let you down. - You might have let us know! - Come on, Greta, let's go and tell the others. - Well, I'm not conducting it. - Don't look at me. - The next item on our program is a composition by one of our students, Jason Pengalli. I think it is fair to describe it as a rather ambitious work and one we haven't had a lot of time to rehearse. It is, however, yet another example of what we've been doing here this summer, and... Well, I hope you enjoy it. Ladies and gentlemen, to conduct the first public performance of his own work, the composer. [applause] [quiet, intense orchestral music] [music intensifies] [intense violin music] [gong rings loudly] [applause and cheers] [overlapping chatter] - [Mrs. Keane] Congratulations. See you next year. - [Gwyn] Very pleased with yourselves? - Greta, I'd like to thank you. - [Martin] What for? - Well, I thought she played fairly well. - She made you look like a genius. - All right, Martin. - All you can say is "thank you"? - What else should I do? - Give her a kiss. - [Martin] Hey! - [Sara] Yeah! [All cheer] - [Girl] Goodbye, Miss Jonas. [overlapping chatter] - Thanks. - Jason, it was a pleasure. - I told you it'd work. - Goodbye, Colin. Are we going to see you back again next year? - Maybe. - You did well. - Not too bad yourself. - Thanks. [buzzes] [Flea screams] [All laugh] - There are just some things we'll never understand. - Do you believe in the supernatural? - I'm more jazz and gin. - [Girl] Yeah, okay, I'll call you. - See you Jason. - Seize fate by the throat, boy. - Bye. [thunder crashes] [uptempo classical piano music] [thunder crashes] [maniacal laughter] [orchestral music]
