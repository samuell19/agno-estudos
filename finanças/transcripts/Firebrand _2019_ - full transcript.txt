FAMILY COURT, MUMBAI. Hello. I'm almost there. See you in a bit. Radha Mohite, Nilesh Mohite. Have you brought the property papers? Yes. Will the hearing take place today? Yes, the matter is on board. My client does not own any property. He is unemployed. Mr. Morarka drives a BMW. He lives in a four thousand square-foot apartment. It's located in South Mumbai. He might not own any property. But he does have a major share in the family accounts. He has enough money to sustain many generations. As the daughter-in-law of such an affluent family, my client deserves her share. The learned counsel is ignoring this. She is misleading the court, Your Honor. My client does not have anything that belongs to him. That's why it is impossible for him to pay any alimony. They got married at the Taj Mahal hotel. He has been featured in well-known lifestyle magazines. He is an heir to properties worth crores of rupees. Your Honor, I'd like to submit these papers. Copies of all his property and share documents. And a featured article. My client dedicated her entire life to this man. She bore him three children. I hope she doesn't have to be penniless, at this age. Let's schedule this for another date. Serious, as always. I hear a lot about you. You enjoy defeating male opponents in the courtroom. Good. I'm glad that they get defeated. I admire feminists. Come on, Freddie. Stop teasing me. You did that when we were in college. Spare me now. If you confront me in court someday... I'll be the one who will win. Come in. Please don't cry. I don't know what to do. My husband was having an affair. He brought that woman home. My children are extremely disturbed because of this. I feel like a servant in my own house. I need a solution. Otherwise, I'll go mad. Calm down. Don't worry. Everything will be alright. Are you a housewife or a working woman? I used to work in the banking sector. He made me quit that job. Now, it is very difficult to get a job. I'll have to start all over again. I feel like I've forgotten everything I knew. Have you spoken to him about the divorce? I tried. But he avoids every possible discussion. We will find some grounds for divorce. It definitely amounts to cruelty. What are you doing? That's a lot of food. Eat, my dear. You've lost weight. You need to get some rest. My work doesn't let me rest. Listen. There's a conference in Spain that I need to attend. -Come along. -I don't think I can. Dates have been assigned to the cases that I'm handling. I'd rather not postpone them. I don't think so. Those poor women! -What about your poor husband? -Come on! You have no time for me. -Why are you saying that? -Because it's the truth. -Do you know something? -What? There are many women who are jealous of me. Really? Shut up! All men have a guilty pleasure. -Guilty pleasure? -Flirting. Any woman will do. Me? With you around, I wouldn't dare to flirt. You will take me to court even if I talk to women. How dramatic! -Dramatic? -Of course. -I know you have a thing for Smita. -Do I? A soft spot for Renuka as well. -And your assistant Jacqueline. -What about her? We all have eyes. And the world is full of beautiful objects. What's the harm in looking? This! -This is the real problem. -What? The objectification of women. Eat. Yes, I will. Come here. Come. Why? Your neck pain. -Yes. -Sit down. -Are you feeling better? -Yes. You must be tired. You work very hard. Madhav, why didn't you wake me up? -I am late. -You were very tired. You were having a sound sleep. I just let you be. Have your breakfast. -No. -Eat something. I am late. -Breakfast is ready. -I'll have something at work. -Have it, quickly. -I don't want to. -Wait. -No, thanks. He'll tell you what needs to be prepared for dinner. -Take it easy. -Yes. -See you. Bye. -Take care! Okay. The case is yet to be argued. I'd like to remind the learned counsel that the supreme court has ruled that for an estranged wife, the family court cannot delay grant of maintenance. It is also stated that a husband cannot escape from the responsibility of providing financial support to his wife, despite soured relations. The petitioner should deposit money for the litigation expenses as well. My client is not obliged to deposit money for the respondent. The court has no such justification. Please enter the witness box. Why did you get into this litigation? You know that your son is unwell. Instead of spending money on his treatment you are fighting with your wife. This is injustice towards the child. Try! Try to patch up with your wife. And live together like a family. I am sorry, sir. I can't live with this woman anymore. If the husband neglects his financially dependent wife and refuses to take care of their sick child, an urgent hearing takes place at the high court and an order is issued to provide maintenance. Your Honor, this is not fair. The learned counsel mentioned something about the supreme court. Now, she's talking about the high court. She may have forgotten that she is in the family court. As per the judge's discretionary powers and the Family Court Act, the judges can overrule all the objections to make sure that the family gets justice. I request you to grant at least one third of his earnings as maintenance to my client. The court has an order for the petitioner Chandresh Keniya. The respondent Lilavati Keniya needs to be paid thirty thousand rupees, every month. From the fifteenth of this month, until the final argument. Let's proceed. Let me go. Let me go. Let me go. Let me go. Let me go. Let me go. Sunanda, what do you think triggered this pain? I think it's physical touch. Has it always been that way? Most of the time. My whole body seems to repel. Many years have gone by. Why are you still helpless? I think that's because I could do nothing to him. To be honest, I wanted to kill him. Didn't the outcome of the case provide you any relief? The case went on for five years. He was released after a three year term in prison. But I was the one who was punished. My parents did not want to file the case. I had younger siblings. An NGO helped me file the case. My parents were not involved in anyway. They left me and moved to Kolhapur. As if... I was dead to them. But I wanted justice. I was humiliated at court. They asked me indecent questions. They made me feel like I was at fault and that I must have been the culprit. With the NGO's support I was able to study Law. My husband. My friend. I owe my recovery and success to him. But, Sunanda... Consider this as your rapist. Hit him. Leave me. Let me go. Let me go. Let me go. You bastard! Bloody dog! You ruined my life! Let me go. Help! -Sunanda... -No. You bloody eunuch! You are impotent! A neuter! Bastard! Street dog! You ruined my life! Bloody dog! Drunkard! Scamster! Sunanda... -No. I won't spare him. -Sunanda! -Doctor. -He must be punished! Mr. Krishnamurthy. Then I told my mother and she told my father. Today I had a discussion with a client. Her husband is gay. What should she do? What's the point of a marriage that has no scope for physical intimacy? I realized something. I have not been a good wife to you. We're having wine and dinner. Talk about something else. Let me speak. Go on. I fail to understand. Though I love you, I allow that incident to affect us. Do you know why? Because... Well... Totally different. What do you mean? When there's a lot of love between a couple, there is no guarantee that their sex life will also be good. On the contrary, when the sex life is good there's no certainty that they love each other. Ideally, in married life, both partners should be equally involved. But no one gets everything in life. And in our case, we are already trying. Aren't we? Relax. Yes. Why aren't you drinking? I have to drive you home. I'm your chauffeur for the day. Did you like it? -Yes, it's good. -Okay. -I'll taste it. -Please do. To be honest... our marriage has lasted this long only because of you. You are having a good time, aren't you? You are intoxicated. Am I right? The wine was really good. The evening was... What are you doing? You crazy! There's traffic ahead. -Sunanda... -To hell with the traffic. -We need to watch out. -Look at your hair. What about my hair? It's always been like that. -It never falls in place. -Yes. I know. I know that my hair never falls in place. In place... Sunanda! You're behaving like a kid. Your hand... There's traffic ahead. There'll be an accident. There'll be an accident, darling. There's traffic out there. Let me park the car! Sunanda... Stop it. Sunanda, move aside. Sunanda! -No, don't do this. -Let me. Don't do that. Move aside. Wait. Check this out. Looks like they are having a good time. -They are making out in the car. -Madhav, no! Stop bothering us. Why don't you mind your own business? Get lost. Madhav, come inside. -Let's go. -We are married. You are my wife! -Let's go. -Crazy people. Idiots! When women and children get justice, it brings honor to our judicial system and the country. It is clear that the petitioner Harish Morarka has misrepresented the facts about his assets. That is why, the respondent Anjali Morarka is at a disadvantage. Mr. Morarka, sell your assets or withdraw your share from the family funds. Pay your wife a compensation. Or, an alimony. I order petitioner Harish Morarka to pay the respondent Anjali Morarka, a maintenance of five lakh rupees, per month. Or a onetime settlement of five crore rupees. He must take full responsibility of his children's education. And, every month he should pay one lakh rupees as maintenance, to each child. -Comments. -Ma'am, your comments please. -Sunanda... -Mr. Harish is here. Let's go. I'm filled with gratitude. Sir, what's your next plan? -Sir, please. -Listen to me. I have nothing to say right now. Have you seen this? Congratulations, buddy. Your wife is extremely successful. She's very dedicated and hard working. You know her. Harish Morarka is the same guy we spotted the other day. He was at the Trident hotel with a fashionista. -That's him. -Yes. There's no limit to such a person's debauchery. Do you know what he was claiming? He claimed that he doesn't have any money. I saw you on TV as well. So, tell me. He owns a big advertising agency. Well established MNCs are his clients. A family lawyer's duty is to always give precedence to the welfare of the family. I always advise an amicable settlement, because litigation can get very messy and painful. For everyone. If you think that this marriage is over... we can proceed. Is he involved with anyone? With anyone? There are many women he's involved with. Anyone special in your life? Of course, a long time ago... I used to have many admirers. They were desperate to fulfill every wish of mine. Do you have children? I have a daughter. She's 10 years old. If there's mutual consent involved, we can work out some terms. I need to meet him to take it forward. I trust you. I know that you will try your best to help a woman. But I have a condition. You will have to be completely honest with me. You will not hide anything from me. And please don't lie to me. Smita, please give her an appointment. I am submitting my client's medical reports of physical abuse. It's a made-up story. My client is at work throughout the day. He needs a place to rest at night. Most importantly, that house belongs to him. It will be wrong to dispossess him of his home. No, it is the petitioner's marital home. She has equal rights. Your client has been abusing her. In such a situation, she has nowhere to go. It will be unjust to keep my client away from his home and his wife. Do you have something to say? -Yes. -Please enter the witness box. I work hard the entire day. When I get back home in the evening, I don't even get a decent meal. Am I not working hard for her and the children? If I am thrown out of my own house, where will I go? You heard what my client had to say. If your client cannot respect and protect his wife, he does not deserve to be with her. I am hereby ruling that the respondent Sadashiv Thombre will stay away from his wife Malati Thombre. He shall also stay away from his home, until the final judgment. This matter is adjourned to the next date. -Thank you! -Please don't do that. Let's leave. Come on. -There you go. -Come on. Smita and you. -Follow up on the Manchanda case. -Okay. And try to get the earliest possible date. Have you discussed any terms? I want to be the owner of the Altamount road apartment. Also, the farm house in Karjat. And 50% of his advertising business. Really? Your demands have increased in three years. Your business has flourished in three years. This wasn't mentioned in the first petition. I wish you had agreed to that earlier. Both of us would have been free. You had filed a divorce petition earlier? Yes. The case has been going on for three years. And there seems to be no end to it. This time she mentioned mutual consent. I thought there'll be an instant resolution. My lawyer is no more. You didn't tell me that your case is already in court. Did I not tell you? Are you sure I did not tell you? Yes, Ms. Patel. You did not. I've been through a lot of torture for three years. -Before that-- -What torture are you talking about? I took fifteen years to establish this business. You want me to give you everything just like that? Yes, because that's where you deserve to be. Ms. Patel. Mind your language. That word does not exist in her dictionary. What about your dictionary? Those were not affairs. What would you call them, darling? You have no time for the family. That's not true, ma'am. Every year we take at least two vacations. -Two vacations-- -Stop it. I don't want to live with you anymore. I want to be fully compensated for the torture and misery you put me through. We will meet in court. I can see that you both are not going to agree upon anything. In this situation, there's no scope for a mutual consent divorce. Are you still living under the same roof? I would advise you to live separately. Get yourself your own respective lawyers. What happened to your lawyer? He was useless. He achieved nothing in three years. Listen to me. You need to defend my case. You need to be truthful. Divya. She has to know. I'll talk to her. I wish you had shown some consideration earlier. Suzie. Why don't you go to your mother's place? Why don't you live with one of the women you sleep with? Sometimes I wonder if you are having an affair. You're in such a hurry to throw me out of the house. You can go to your mother's place. Yes. That way, I'll be out of this house for good and you can claim it. What do you think? Do I look like an idiot, Anand? I can never have a sensible discussion with you. Have you stopped taking your pills lately? I don't want you in my house. Your house? This is not just your house. Are you insane? -You'll get hurt. -I'll show you. Divya, what are you doing? Why are you doing this? I'll get you some water. This is Divya Patel. I have been assaulted. He will kill me. Please help me. Who have you been speaking to? Have some water. Don't try to run away. Have you murdered someone? He looks like a gentleman. I think he's involved in a big scam. What have you done, man? There's something fishy. He must have abused his wife. Or, he may have molested a girl. -I'm sure he has molested a girl. -Quiet, you chatterbox. What is your name? Tell us. You will feel better. Speak up. -A big scam, I suppose. -Where do you stay? Anand. That's not possible until Monday. Are you serious? You mean, I'll have to stay here for the next three days? That woman is insane. Anand, there is a strong case against you. If you cut yourself with a piece of glass, you will obviously bleed. Anand, your finger prints have been found on the glass pieces. That's because I was picking up the glass pieces. A bail might not be possible on Monday either. What should I do? Anand, tell me something. Has she always been-- Shut up! Was she always aggressive and overtly dramatic? Did she injure herself, in the past? Nowadays, women are misusing law. I won't let you go. Wait. I won't let you go. Stop. -Let me go. -Wait! Stop! I won't let you go. Let me go. Let me go. Let me go. Sunanda. Sunanda! I am here. There's nobody else. Nobody is here. -He has come back again. -Who? He has come back again. He is always after me. Even after so many years, why is the nightmare still bothering me? You are far better now. You are far better now, my dear. After six months, I had that nightmare again. I realize that I am holding on to it. But I don't know how to let it go. You're right. We hold on to things. Do you mean I am holding on to the identity of a victim? That I have no other identity? -Doctor, may I say something? -Go ahead. I think Sunanda is very focused when it comes to her job. All the hard work and success... has something to do with what happened in the past. It has a direct connection. The passion to fight against injustice has got something to do with that incident. A woman who has been wronged is now supporting women who are wronged or abused to fight their battles and to fight the male dominated system. The court is like my battlefield. Regarding your job and professional status. If you function with a liberated mind, you'll achieve happiness and job satisfaction. But if you operate as a victim, your identity as a victim keeps getting stronger. How can I break this identity of a victim? I'll give you an exercise. Do it every day, without fail. -Okay. -Your pain will subside. But the real problem is that human beings like to suffer. They love to be miserable. And they don't know that there is a choice when it comes to suffering. But, Doctor... why would someone choose to suffer? Suffering or sadness feeds your identity. It fuels the identity you've created. When you destroy your identity, you destroy your suffering. Please pen down every detail about your rape. As if you were penning down your autobiography. All the pain, trauma and suffering you went through fifteen years ago. Write every minute detail. Then? Then, read the story out loud in front of a mirror at least five times. The next day, write the story again. Read it again, five times. But do this daily, without fail. Call me up next week. I'll check the progress. Sir? Ma'am. They bailed you out. Our marriage means nothing to you. I told you that I would teach you a lesson. Get ready for some more. Have you thought about its impact on Anuya? After all, she is my daughter. Anyway, the damage has been done thanks to your disgusting genes. I wish Anuya doesn't grow up to be anything like you! I would like to tell you this, once again. Anuya's problem is not genetic. It's neurological. Why don't you understand this? As far as bad genes are concerned, they could be yours as well. Why have you come here? I don't even want to speak to you. I don't even want to get close to you. I have come here to gather my belongings. I am waiting to get rid of you. Take her inside. On my way home from school... I entered a toilet. When I came out of the toilet... a man attacked me. He dragged me away. I tried very hard, but I couldn't stop him. He pinned me down. He... was drunk. He was stinking! He put his hands on me and tore my blouse. His dirty lips and prickly beard scratched my face. I couldn't breathe. I was feeling suffocated. He lifted my skirt. And... he... removed my underwear. His hands abused my private parts. I was screaming, but there was no one around who could rescue me. Then, he thrust himself into me and I become a victim of unbearable pain. He continued that for quite some time. Stop it now. You can continue tomorrow. Enough now. No, let me do it. I want to end this, once and for all. That's enough now. Go to bed. Come on. No, Sunanda. Don't. Sunanda. Don't, Sunanda. Sunanda. Sunanda! Sunanda... Sunanda. Please don't. I was just trying. Why do you need to? Things will fall into place. No. I've been realizing that you are not happy with me. Your life has come to a standstill. That's not true. That's not true. I think I should leave you. Only then, you will be able to move on and be happy. You can get married to a nice girl. You like children, don't you? You will have children. You'll be able to have a family of your own. Come on, Sunanda. Why are you being so serious? We are great friends, for now. We don't need to get into something that is painful to you. It's as simple as that. Listen to me. Forget about everything and go to bed. Sleep. You need to go to work tomorrow. No. I think it is time for us to separate. You will have to agree with me. It's not reachable. Jacqueline, keep trying. -I've already tried a couple of times. -Try to call Sunanda. I found some interesting material regarding Divya Patel. Really? Excuse me. Sunanda, Jacqueline here. Madhav has not come to the office. Do you know where he is? No. He left for work at his usual time. I don't know where he is. Okay. She has no idea. Ma'am, your tea is getting cold. Okay, I'll have it in a bit. Here's your order. I wonder where he is. When did they start having differences? I'll tell you. They were asked to take their daughter out of normal school and get her admitted to a special school. She created a huge ruckus at that time. She also sued the school. I need fuel worth two thousand rupees. This is Madhav Patkar. I need to speak to you. The exercise suggested by you... is very... stressful for her. I don't understand the point... of making her relive the trauma especially when she is trying hard to recover. When a person writes about his traumatic experiences in detail and reproduces it, its effect is real, emotional and experiential. But after repeated writing, it becomes a story. With every version, the emotional investment and the use of words keeps reducing. Gradually, the person starts disconnecting himself from that incident. Its significance decreases. And the impact of the trauma disappears. Wow! In that case, the chances are good. What do you think? You have been working with me for about six years. You must have an opinion. Please stop what you're doing and come here. Come on. I want to share something with you. I did not hit my wife. In fact, I did not even touch her. Does anyone have anything to say? We know the truth now. Radhika, you were working on the Save the Girl Child campaign. You thought I'll give you a few days off from work? I've been with the Zen masters for the past few days. Burning inch by inch That's how life progresses Human beings are not at fault Everyone searches for happiness Going with the twists and turns That's how life can be understood Burning down to the ground And touching the skies Burning inch by inch Burning inch by inch Sunanda. Sunanda. -Get inside. -Madhav? Where were you all day? I called you so many times. We have been looking for you all day. If you hadn't returned by morning, I would have gone to the police. I had gone to examine a client's property. Madhav, you're lying to a lawyer. You're lying to your wife. I just went to get some fresh air. Go to bed. What about you? I'll sleep right here. No way. Go to bed. I'll sleep here. Please go to bed. No. Go inside. I will sleep right here. This argument is going nowhere. You win. Come on. Come on. I told you that I'll handle your case. You will not hide anything from me. You will always tell me the truth. So? I think you're hiding something from me. I think you have been talking to someone else and you trust that person more than me. I have met him only once when you brought him to my office. After that I haven't felt the need to talk to him. Then, I don't understand. Why are you doubting me? I have my own judgment. If I come to know that you have been lying to me or hiding things from me, I will not handle your case. Go ahead. What do you want to know? What happened that night when you called the police and had your husband arrested? Come on, everybody knows. I've told you. People know. The press-- I am not interested in any stories. Sunanda! You are fighting my divorce case. This is not some criminal investigation. I want the truth. Fine, we got into a scuffle. He got angry and he injured me. Oh! We already have a new version of the story. Scuffle? Who started it? Obviously, he did. What provoked him? Come on, stop it. You have no idea. What is it like? He doesn't care. He ignores me and behaves like I don't exist. Here's what I think. After a few years into your marriage you have grown apart, like most couples do. That's what happens in marriages. Isn't this injustice? I am suffering while he enjoys with other women-- What happened that night? He doesn't care about me. I don't matter to him. This is common in 90% of marriages. What's the big deal? Do I have to tell you? Yes. Okay, we had a scuffle. I was angry with him. I broke the glass and hurt myself. Don't tell this to anyone. What else are you hiding? It's very important for me to know everything. His lawyer may bring up something that I'm not aware of. How will I be able to represent you suitably? Not much, maybe worth a few lakhs. Ms. Patel, the diamonds and solitaires you are wearing are worth fifty lakhs. Alright. I won't wear them to court. I won't. Please leave. The jewelry is worth three and a half crores. Anything else? My other clients are waiting. Wait, give me some time to think. I need to recollect. I have a car worth fifty lakhs. A farm house in Karad worth seven crores. And some shares in Tatas and Reliance. I am absolutely fit. In fact, I can walk the ramp even now. About six years ago, when Anand had an affair and he wanted to leave me. I used to bang my head against the window. I went into depression. I tried slashing my wrist. Then I began to see a psychiatrist called Dr. Sheth. You have no idea what I had to deal with... and what I had to go through. My daughter is autistic. My marriage was falling apart. I was depressed and helpless. I couldn't control my anger. I abused people. Once, I was walking down the road. There was an old man out there. Are you still on medication? On and off. Tell me something. You already have a lot of money and property. Why do you want more? I want to make sure that he is poor. He has destroyed me and hurt me. Because of him I had to deliver a child who is not perfect. I was a runner-up at the Miss India contest. But I gave birth to an imperfect child. It is beyond my tolerance. What's the matter? Why aren't you coming to bed? I'm busy with work. Sunanda, what are you doing? I am working. I am working. I know that you've been very disturbed. That's because I discussed separation. Try to understand. Why should you suffer, unnecessarily? If we can't be happy, we must separate. I don't want you to sacrifice. I'm afraid that I might lose you completely. After the separation, we can be friends. I don't want to talk about this. I mean it. Please go to bed. You will have to think about it. Divorce is the only solution. Enough. Please go to bed. Let me do my work. Listen to me, please. What? Let's separate, for a few days. One of us needs to leave. We will meet after a few weeks and discuss about how we feel. Please, don't say no. Madhav. Madhav. Madhav. Madhav, where are you? Sunanda, think about what you really want. You can call me once you've made up your mind. Ma'am, he doesn't seem to be around. Has he gone somewhere? Yes, Renuka. He's out of town. -What do you want for breakfast? -I don't want anything. Please leave. Okay. I'm glad you are here. People who go to the city, never bother to visit us. But I visit you frequently. Yes. At least, for a bit. But you've been away for a long time. You weren't here for Chimnee's wedding. Sorry about that. -It is Raghu's final year at school. -That's good. We need to plan his future. What do you want to pursue? -I don't know. -Don't be shy. -Speak to him for some guidance. -Yes, I will. Sister-in-law. How is Chimnee? Chimnee is fine. -She's into the sixth month of pregnancy. -Wow! Any particular reason you dropped in without informing us? I finished a whole lot of work and wanted to take a break. So, here I am. What about your wife? She is very busy. -She doesn't get time off work. -Okay. But you should plan a family. That's right. Don't delay it. People in the cities are late when it comes to planning a family. Don't delay it any longer. Then, he lifted my skirt. And... On my way home from school... I entered a toilet. When I came out of the toilet... a man attacked me. He dragged me away. I tried very hard, but I couldn't stop him. He was very strong. He dragged me to a corner. And then, he pinned me down. He tore my clothes. You should try saving rain water. -I've been thinking about it. -Good. I've heard about it and I want to try it out. Okay. I hope it rains. -It won't be possible if it doesn't rain. -That's true. I need to ask you something. Please, go ahead. Your wife is a lawyer. Yes. She handles divorce cases. Yes, she is a divorce lawyer. Strange things are happening in the village. Really? Yes. Four girls from our village have returned from their marital homes. Their marriages are over. They wasted their money on the wedding. They are dependent on their parents now. It's very disheartening. People are impulsive. They are getting more and more reckless with relationships. I am worried. About what? What if Chimnee comes back? Come on, brother. Don't be silly. Why worry about something that hasn't even occurred... and something that's never going to happen? -True. -Don't worry. I'm there. My client has already given the petitioner financial security worth twenty crores. Properties, shares, diamonds and jewelry. That should be enough for the petitioner. The wealth will also suffice many future generations. My client has earned these assets after several years of hard work. Do you mean that the petitioner's demand for money... is a mere tactic to appease her frustration? My client is going through a lot of trauma. The respondent assaulted her. He was jailed for that and the case is still in court. How much can a woman tolerate? Yes, I know about such cases. The client you are representing considers money as the solution to all her problems. We have to examine the custody angle. Let's proceed to the next date. At least you should have argued the matter. Mayuri Gupta. Rajesh Gupta. Listen to me. -Come on. -Listen. What did the judge mean? What have you done? You've ruined the case. Anuya. Anuya. -Yes, Anand. Tell me. -Freddie. Give Divya everything she asked for. Please make sure that I get Anuya's custody. Especially, when we seem to be winning. I don't care about winning or losing. Let's have an out of court settlement. I'll talk to her lawyer. I don't want to see you anymore. Really? Focus on the tasks at hand. Let me focus on my studies. I have something important to share. -Come on. -No. I'm quite sure about this. Let's not see each other anymore. Please leave. What are you so serious about? I don't understand. I am not leaving without you. I'll be right here waiting for you. -Come on. -Let's go. -Are you comfortable? -Yes. What did you want to share? Let's get married. What? Are you crazy? I want to spend my life with you. I know that you like me. I know, for sure. Listen to me. We are good friends. But, marriage? I cannot marry anyone. The trauma that I've been through... will always come across as a hurdle between us. What if we don't allow it to? I don't think it is possible. Sunanda. Many women face such incidents in their lives. Every day. Do they live a hopeless life? They may be able to handle it. I cannot. What about your family and your relatives? They... will never accept me. I belong to a lower caste family. And... I am a rape victim. You're none of that. Is that clear? That's not what I think of you. Don't bother about my family and relatives. I don't even remember when I lost my parents. I was raised by my uncle in some distant village. I shifted to the city for a living. Now, I am independent. To be honest... if I don't see you even for a day... I feel as if my life is at a standstill. Don't say that, Madhav. We are all individuals. No one can depend on another. Why can't we be together? -I've decided to marry you-- -You're going to regret this. Don't blame me later on. Brother. Chimnee! When did you arrive? -Come here. -A little while ago. I see. Sit down. Be careful. Chimnee! It's been so long. I couldn't attend your wedding. Is everything okay? You used to be very talkative before you got married. Why are you so quiet? Chimnee, if there's an issue please share it with me. Chimnee, say something. I should not have left school. I should've continued my studies. Does your husband take good care of you? Does he drink? Does he beat you? Yes, sometimes. But don't tell my parents. I suppose it's bad luck. I'll deal with him. -Please come. -Hello. What does your client want? His child's custody. What will you give me? Five crores... in addition to what you have asked. Take everything you want. Please let me have Anuya's custody. -Anand! -Don't... You need to set aside a considerable amount of money for your daughter's future. Give her whatever she likes. Very soon, she will claim custody of the child. She'll claim that you are not capable of bringing up your daughter. Because you'll have no assets left. Anand, I will never give you what you want. Even if you beg or cry. Anand, I don't think we can have any settlement. Divya, please don't do this. You know that Anuya wants to be with me. I am her mother. She is just a kid. She doesn't understand what's good for her. Anand, let's go. That was good! I will not let him have Anuya's custody, at any cost. On my way home from school, I entered a toilet. When I came out of the toilet a man attacked me. He dragged me away. I tried very hard, but I couldn't stop him. He pinned me down. He tore my clothes and thrust himself upon me. This is repetitive. I am fed up of this. Madhav. And finally, Your Honor, I appeal on behalf of my client. He should be given custody of his daughter Anuya. I will take good care of my daughter. I'll be a very good father. Please note that the child is a ten year old girl. She will grow into a young woman, very soon. At that time, in her journey from puberty to adulthood she will need her mother. And no one can do this better than my client. The petitioner is a depressive manic. For her temper outbursts and self-injurious behavior... she is under psychiatric treatment. To entrust the custody of the child to her... could be a dangerous proposition. How can you say that? Ms. Patel, please maintain the decorum of the court. But... Ma'am, please calm her down. Ms. Patel, please calm down. Or else, you'll be sent out. If this is how she behaves in court, you can imagine... her behavior outside the court. I've heard the final arguments. Now, I am ready to give my judgment. The respondent must give the petitioner a two-bedroom-hall-kitchen residence in a locality that matches her status. Similar to the one she was living in. Minor child Anuya's custody will be given to her respondent father. The child will continue to live with her father. The petitioner will have certain visiting rights. The rights will be mutually agreed upon by the parents. How can you do that? -Make him understand. -Please calm down. -Ms. Patel! -I shouldn't have trusted you. -Calm down. -Ms. Patel, please leave the court. Otherwise, I will have you arrested for contempt of court. -Please understand. She's my daughter. -Let's go. -He is useless. -Let's go. She is my daughter! Is this the way you fight a case? We still have hope. Really? I can't talk to you if you behave like this. Call me when you have calmed down. I will not calm down. You have to listen to me. -Listen to me! -Divya. Stop! I can't talk to you when you are in this condition. -I want my daughter! -Divya. -Listen to me... -Please stop it. Please talk to him. She's my daughter. I want her! Come with me. Listen to me! -You can't leave. Listen to me! -Divya! -Divya, stop it. -You can't leave. Listen! What have you done, Anand? Everything was fine between us. You destroyed it! You destroyed everything! Anand. Ma'am, are you not feeling well? No, I am okay. I am going home now. Postpone all my appointments. Both of you can go to the office. Let bygones be bygones Let the mind be free Let bygones be bygones Let the mind be free Let go of the past Let the heart sing in the present moment Take a new birth Once again Every day I want to spend my entire life with you. To be honest... if I don't see you even for a day... I feel as if my life is at a standstill. We are great friends, for now. We don't need to get into something that is painful to you. Isn't it simple? Hello. Please come in. I'll come in, some other time. This door is very unique. Madhav. He likes such unique and antique things. Wow. Actually, I came to apologize to you for Divya's behavior. Please don't. It wasn't your fault. Actually, I feel bad for Divya. She has everything. But she has to suffer because of her condition. Divya attacked you. She abused you. I am surprised. You still have compassion for her after what she did. Not sure how men react. But when a marriage falls apart... women breakdown completely. Women cannot bear the pain. She simply could not lose with you by her side. That could have been possible. But it wasn't. Divya said that I betrayed her. Maybe I did. I was under the influence of my own judgment. Instead of fighting for her I was fighting for your daughter. I can't thank you enough for that. Are you in a lot of pain? Do you need a massage? I am used to it. I have been seeing you since the case started. A lot has happened over the days. You had to go to jail. I'm sure that affected your reputation. You also had a major fight in court. In spite of that, you are very calm and composed. How do you manage that? I live by a simple rule. It's not that simple. Things that hurt us, have an impact on our lives for many years. But only if we allow that to continue. Here's what I mean. All of us are victims of... something wrong that may have happened in the past. Water keeps flowing under the bridge. Similarly, the bad incidents also disappear from our lives. Something that existed, doesn't exist anymore. We can't control the things that have already occurred. What is this? It's a painting. What's it all about? It's about a bunch of women waiting for someone. They look sad. Really? I don't think so. That's what I see. That's your interpretation. -The painting means something else to me. -What do you think of it? They've come together. But they are different. They look similar. Neither sad nor happy. So? This is what I mean. We make sense of it all. That creates problems. For example? This is a painting that contains portraits of five women. Now think about something that happened in the past and what it means to you. -It shouldn't have happened. -But it happened, right? I once stole a book. Does that mean, I am a thief? I spent three nights in jail. Does that mean, I am a criminal? What are you supposed to do? Please shift. But-- Turn around. Acknowledge it. Forgive. Forgive yourself. Forgive others for whatever they did. Forgive God. Forgive your parents. Forgive your siblings. Forgive everyone. Because, if we don't forgive... we end up suffering. They don't. Yes. Let's play a game. Share an incident from your past. And I'll respond by saying... Then, I'll share an incident from my past. And you'll respond by saying... My father used to beat me when I was a child. My father disowned me. I failed the sixth grade. I was treated as an untouchable all my life. My wife says that I beat her. People have bullied me for being dark skinned. I was beaten up so badly that I had to be hospitalized. I was raped-- Let bygones be bygones. I want to live in the present! I never thought of it like this. I changed my point of view. Are you always so tensed? Don't you get enough rest? I'm a workaholic. Even an entire day, is less for me. Lie down on your stomach. -Lie down. -No. You lost the game. Excuse me. Madhav. Yes, Sunanda? When are you coming home? You sent me away. Don't say that. Please come back home. I am missing you a lot. I miss you too. What happened? Do you need my signature on the divorce papers? Why are you saying that? You said that we need to get separated. Oh God! Just come, will you? Listen to me. And don't be late. We'll have dinner together. I'll be there. Renuka. Yes. Please grind the spices for the stuffed brinjal. I am going to prepare dinner. Okay, ma'am. A little bull. What's up? I'm preparing your favorite meal. Are you trying to impress me? Please freshen up. -I'll bring the food to the table. -Okay. He left the bag here itself. Wow! You are looking quite different tonight. What happened? Anything in particular? Looks like you won the high-profile case of Divya Patel. No. I lost that case. You look amazing. Very radiant! I can't take my eyes off you! Keep looking. Shall I? Are you trying to flirt with me? Tell me what happened. It was a miracle! As per the doctor's advice, I kept reading that story. I got extremely bored of it. I was surprised. I was holding on to the past for so many years. I felt free. How did that happen? I realized that I'm in the present! If I waste these precious moments, time will slip away. Let bygones be bygones. Should I cry over it, all my life? Good! Very good! Finally, you understood. But, how did this happen? I've found a simple solution. Let it go. -Okay. -Let it go. I met someone. And he made me understand. Do you know what happened after that? I spent an entire night with him. We were as intimate as a man and a woman can get. We had sex. But I didn't feel anything. No pain, no suffering, no trauma. The doctor's therapy actually worked. You used to say... that love and sex are two different things. Yes. I agree. Last night there was only a man, a woman... and their hormones. I was not a rape victim. I was not a rape survivor. And, you know what? I wasn't my usual self either! Shall I ask you something? About him? No. I had no control over what happened. As I was letting go of my past... I felt as if my body was coming back to life. It was time to confront my problems. It needed courage. But I won this case. You still have a question, right? You need to know about my feelings for him. Your feelings are yours. Your life is yours. You will have to decide what you want to do. What about your feelings? To be honest... Why are you confused? I can understand. It is very shocking for a husband. But you have the right to express your feelings. You can get angry. You can shout at me. Please say something. It's not about my rights. I love you. I will continue to do so. Your love... Do you have a doubt? Not exactly. Sunanda, relationships are interwoven very intricately. They are very fragile. Balances shift. New equations are created. That's why... It's true. Let bygones be bygones. Can we try living a new life? Why do you think I'm still standing here? You know it very well. I was never into middle class moralities. I trust your love. I mean it. I swear. So, tell me. How could you stay away from me for so many days? I missed you a lot, Madhav. Didn't you miss me? I missed you a lot. But I was scared. I was afraid that you would leave me. I don't think I could have handled a divorce. No way. -Even I couldn't have handled a divorce. -Damn! I will never let you go. I'll take you to Spain. Of course, I'll come. -That's great. -Yes.
