[INSTRUMENTAL SOUL MUSIC PLAYING] Levi Lewis! Now I know who's been doing this. You're gonna hear about this from your father! Mother! Time for supper. ♪ I've been waiting for this moment ♪ All of my life ♪ I've been reinventing myself ♪ Lucia Marie, take those out! [MUSIC BLASTING ON HEADPHONES] Girl, don't you make me have to... Now, Mama. You know where that's gonna lead. You know it's in my nature, child. [EDITH LAUGHS] You are so irritating. Really? [DOOR SLAMS] MARGARET: Marcus, I asked you to please not slam the door. [MAMA GRUNTS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Bow your heads. Father God, thank you for this family, this food and your many blessings. Bless this food that will nourish our bodies in your name, Jesus, as we all say... As we all say... ALL: Amen. Levi, really? Slow moving. So annoying. You know why I'm late, Levi? Because I had a call from Mr. Thompson. Dad! I have enough stress, with you once more running over his leaves is the last thing I need. Dad, I said I'm sorry. That's what you said the last time, Levi! I was sorry last time, too. Don't you mock me, boy! Marcus, please. You got something to say? Dad, truly, I apologize. [METAL CLATTERING] Pick that up! I'm getting it. MARCUS: You gonna go in the morning and you gonna rake his leaves for him. But I have practice in the morning and... You should've thought of that before. You love your neighbor as you love yourself, Levi. You got that, boy? Yes, sir. Huh? Yes, sir. [CHUCKLES] STEVE: You were quiet last night. A woman cannot survive on peanut butter spoon alone. Not much else to survive on. Out of milk again? My bad. Milk bad. Oh. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] If you can't beat 'em... Uh, you need to be dropped off at work? Um, yeah. Please do. I'll be ready in ten. [DOOR CLOSES] [ENGINE STARTS] Bri! Dad! Dad, you okay? Dad, it's okay, I'm okay. Do you need to go back and get your meds, or... No! No! [PANTING] No, I'm fine. It's okay. I'll be fine. Just go ahead. [ENGINE STARTS] [PLAYING PIANO] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] All good here, Bri? Yeah. My hand just slipped. You working on what we talked about? It's not that easy. It's up to you. LUCIA: ♪ Baby don't want that booty ♪ Girl don't want that delicious flavor ♪ Drink that love from my... ♪ What, what, what ♪ Booty, booty, booty booty, booty, booty bootylicious ♪ [LAUGHS] Girl, don't you make me have to... You got a lot of learning to do. ♪ Mmm, mmm, take that, take that, take that ♪ Mama, please! Don't please me, please yourself. Girl, you're like water been on too long, you're 'bout to boil off. Get up off that table. ♪ Bootylicious ♪ ♪ Booty, booty, booty, booty ♪ Take that, take that ♪ [SCREAMS] Miss me, now you gotta kiss me. Oh, girl. You gone be the death of me. Mother, I asked you not to hide the remotes. You know how Marcus feels about it. Well, when he get to the point where he wants 'em, Marcus know where to find 'em, now don't he? All righty. Uh-huh. You sure you don't have something else to do until I finish? I mean, I'm gonna be here for a while. I think this about as far as Mama wanna go for a while. [WHISPERING] Point to point. Mother, why don't you just let me help you with that? Well, who taught you? Well, then, that answers that then, don't it? [DOOR OPENING] Huh. That'll be the number one prodigal returning safe and sound. Hallelujah. I guess I will go on to the bathroom before dinner. Everything's moving, and Mama grooving. MARCUS: In Jesus' name, let the good children say... ALL: Amen! Amen! So, Janay's having a sleepover tonight and she invited me. Is her parents going to be there? Her mom will be. Not her father? I'm sure, Mama, if she knew who her father was she would let you know. It's "Mother." I'm sure, Mother, if she knew... Girl, is the light bulb over your head burnt out? Let me help you with that, Mother. MAMA: I got it. Well, all right. You can go, baby girl. Thanks, Daddy. Mmm-hmm. I promise I'll clean up my room and do my homework in the morning. Okay. Hey, Marg, I got to go into the office tomorrow for a while. Here we go. I thought you said that you were done with Saturdays and that that project was over. MARCUS: I guess this is a new one. This is a new project. Well, this is the sacrifice you gotta make. You want food on the table? It's either this or Sunday. No! No! I understand. Well, if, if I was gone... [CHOKING] MARGARET: Mother! LUCIA: Will water help? Come on. Lift 'em up! Woman, if you didn't take such big bites... Marcus, not now! Don't disrespect me in my house. Lean back. Work is calling. LUCIA: Okay, gross. I'm going. I'm going to get dressed. Thank you, Jesus. I thought I was gonna meet Jesus. [BREATHES RASPILY] But at least it was nice to know it would have been over some fine home cooking. [LAUGHING] Oh-oh. Ooh. [EXHALES] Saturday's all set, baby. Be available for you all day Sunday. Not a problem. Mmm. This is the best salad. ♪ I have hurt ♪ God ♪ I have sinned ♪ I have idols I have scars and addictions ♪ But by your love, God ♪ You called my name ♪ And I am saved ♪ I am saved ♪ That was good. It started good. That's all. Thanks. I was working on the ending when I got home. I like your bridge, though. It's what's been missing. You're too quick to keep the G. It shouldn't resolve so easily. [CHUCKLES] That's what I was thinking, too. Maybe not the way people think it should. I can go get my guitar and show you. Yeah, you're probably right. I'm right a lot. Not that it matters. [DOOR OPENS] What's wrong? MARCUS: Levi. Levi Lewis. Get over here! [HORN HONKING] Bye, Daddy, see you tomorrow. Uh-huh. LUCIA: Hey, ya'll. Turn up. Hi, Ms. Thompson. How you doin'? [ALL CHEERING] MR. NORDOFF: That was good, guys. See you later. Brianna, you ready? No. Why not? Can we talk in private? Sure. Come in my office. Everything okay? Look, I'm trying here. I'm not trying to be BFFs or anything. It's personal. You wouldn't want to be involved. Rock the boat. Boat's already rocking. Is it the same thing? You know? I've always known. You haven't fixed it? Too many things to fix. Low priority. Look. We haven't been talking, but it's got to start somewhere. I could help you, you know. We could help each other. Then you won't feel indebted. Good job. Thanks Mr. N.Yeah. We'll talk again soon, Brianna. Don't forget what I said. You really would help me? I said I would. You said a lot of things. Double driven. You know? I'm not hopeful. Hope is all we have right now. Like I said, I think this could be the start of something new, a fresh beginning. For everyone. I don't know. I got a lot going on. Yeah, right. You don't know me! Enough to know you have time. It's been long enough. Meet me here. Safety zone! I guess we can try. Okay, then. Step one. Check. [CELL PHONE BEEPS] [CLEARS THROAT] MAMA: Lord have mercy. I am about to stick my foot all up in this. Mmm-hmm. [CHUCKLES] I have to work again tomorrow. Boy. Mmm-hmm. Mmm! Ain't nothing like the good cooking of a woman who loves Jesus. We're studying the dynamic of family in sociology, Mama. Oh, really, is that right? Well, tell me. What does the school book say that the good book can't? Well, we're talking about family and the connection of roles and how the lack of socialization within a unit. American studies show that American families are just not happening anymore. Any, more. Roll those eyes again. It's very interesting. Do you know that out of eight of my homegirls, only two of them have parents that are still together? Hmm. That's because they don't value the home. Do not value the importance of sitting down together each evening and reconnecting. Well, back in my day, it was a given. You'll get whooped silly if you missed supper time. Oh, that's right! You would get whooped for disrespecting the family that way. What do you know about respect, Levi? Oh, he knows, son. He knows. I'm asking Levi! Here. Here's your pills, Mama. Go on, pass those to your grandma. Dressing it up don't make it a thing you, know? Anyways, um, I asked my friends if they all sit and have dinner with their families. And they had some interesting stories. Mmm-hmm. You know, this gathering is a bit archaic. You know, a TV dinner in front of a box don't make a family. Mmm-mmm. Silent gatherings don't either. Are you okay, Levi? Yes, ma'am. I'm fine. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Got anything else you like to say there, Levi? LEVI: No, sir. Huh? No, sir. What's that? No, sir. [GLASS CLINKING] I'm proud to announce that this Saturday, I'm sorry, this Sunday, I'll be serving for the pastor. Seem to me it ain't the pastor who needs protecting. I think it's actually a great thing. And I can assure you that me and the family will make sure that we're there on time ready to support you. It's the least we can do. Go on and take your pills, Mother. Mama is fine. See? No, no need to fuss. Everything's perfect. ♪ Search me ♪ Oh, God ♪ Know my heart ♪ Trust me ♪ I am trying! This is trying? Get over yourself. See the chord in your hand, an open chord. These are the corresponding notes. This sucks. Yeah. But you gotta get this right or Nordoff is going to kick you out, so it has to sink in. Fine. [PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] No, stop. That's not right. It's better, but it's not what's on the page. Are you making it up? Sounds better, anyway. Not the point. You have to read the notes. C. A. D. F. Good. Now, play it. [PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] Better. You need to feel it more though. Ooh. [GRUNTS] Okay. Ooh. Thank you, child. You welcome, Mama. Oh, thank you, child. Whoo, Lord, yes. Mmm-hmm. Ain't nothing 'bout the good book say anything about smoking. Boy, let me indulge in my prevention from insanity in peace. It's enough judgment going on around here. Like the pastor said to me once, it ain't a sin, you just get to heaven faster. Lord knows that's gonna happen soon enough. [CHUCKLES] Not like this family needs some more drama. [LEVI CLAPPING] I think she's got it. Thank you is always nice. Thanks. So, um, show me what you been playing. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] No, no, no, that's not right. You gotta break the chords up.

Hey, you guys, that song is amazing. Definitely keep on working on that. The other song, it's going to be amazing. It's gotta be big for the showcase. So, we got to come clean about what we're doing. Why? Everyone's gonna freak. Uh, not that I care. I just have to worry about my dad. He's fragile. Oh, yeah? It's been hard on him. Can I ask? If it's cool and all. [EXHALES] There can be things that we don't have to talk about, you know. That's cool, too. Man, Bri, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. That's just it. No one ever talks about it. It's like, time stopped and I, you, everyone kept going forward, but life, you know. I get it. Do you? I mean, of course you do. You lost so much. How can you even look at me? Help me do what we're doing? God driven. Forgiveness has to start with me. For him. Not the same. Bri. Look at me. None of this is your fault. None of this is my fault. Been locked into that day. But it doesn't have to define today. Not anymore. This has to stop. It's not healthy for anyone. It's the only way to move forward. It's like I keep hearing at church. If you don't forgive, it's just going to eat you up inside. This thing just keeps growing. It's like a cancer. And it's killing everyone. You checked out! I've had no one to talk to. Everybody checked out. I lost. I even lost you. [CRYING] Come here. [CRYING] Forgive me. I'm sorry. He would have wanted it. Just let it out. Just let it go. LUCIA: Mama, what's up? Devil got a foothold, child. One drop gonna ruin us all. What are you talking about? Where's Mama? Mother. Whatever. Where's my mother? Guess the Lord getting ready to do something. Because he's been so faithful until now? Girl, you don't know until you know. You think the good Lord gonna let us just sit here and die? He loves you too much, child. Yeah, whatever. Now, that may work on your mama but it don't work on me, and if I was quick enough... Yeah, I heard it before. Well, you gonna hear it again unless you get it twisted. It ain't me twisted. You sure about that? Pizza? Lost your mind, haven't you? Ow, Mama, okay. Stupid is the devil's playground. What's that boy thinking? [CHUCKLES] Boys think? [CHUCKLES] [BOTH, IN SING-SONG VOICE] Hey! [BOTH LAUGHING] Extra cheese? Don't put none of that pineapple on there. Lord knows if God wanted fruit on a pizza he'd have dropped it from a tree. Okay, Mama. Hi, I'd like to order the extra-large. Oh, the trip was crazy. [EXHALES] Problem? You already prayed? I don't get it. Why now? Something must have set her off. She was finally getting back to herself. Mmm-hmm. Sure she was, darling. You know what? Unfortunately, I have a work emergency. So I'm gone head back to the office. You sure you don't want to check up on her, Dad? You trying to start something with me, boy? No, sir. I'll get a tray. You bring it upstairs to Mom. Boys are dumb. Keep the faith, darling. Good Lord sees it all and he loves us just the same. Dang it. I said no pineapple. That's not pineapple, Mama. That's artichokes. It's good for you. Well, where in the blazes kind of place did you order something like this from that they would put something like this on here? Next you'll have mayonnaise to dip it in. Maybe ketchup, but not mayo. Let's not get crazy. Already there, baby doll, already there. [BOTH LAUGHING] You know, Levi? The elevator may not always go to the top floor, but you got the goings on of what make a fine man. I'll take it to her, but you know she's not going to eat it. Well, baby, it's just the thought that counts. Giving her some love, that's all. Back in my day, I could have been a master pastor. But I didn't have all the right body parts to fit the bill. [BOTH LAUGHING] Whole new world, Mama. Aw, not my world. I'm ol' school, baby. You know, if the pipes a-knocking, don't bother rocking. [BOTH LAUGHING] Something like that. You got some lyrics in you, Mama. Oh, I got a whole lot in me, child. Ooh. That's where all this noise coming from. Hurry up, boy. Get me outside because I'm about to blow up. Yes, ma'am. I'm gonna explode. Child. [GRUNTS] Don't let the lady gas upset you. Girl, don't pretend you don't see me. And I won't pretend you didn't see me smoking. Little girl, I've known you since the day you were born. Then why wouldn't you have been talking to me this whole time? Now, see, you got something there. Yeah, blood is thicker than water. Blood spilling gets thicker than water, too. Meaning, it gets tangled with the water and it can't flow. Nothing to do with you and me. When you were a little baby, you would fall down and not cry. Then jump back up again. I'm not a baby anymore. You sure ain't. Look at you. All grown. But you still sucking on that stick like a little baby. You the pot or the kettle? Oh, see, there you go. There you go. [LAUGHS] Spunky baby B. I missed that. [LAUGHS] What you doing with a mouth full of peanut butter anyway? Ain't no cooking going on over there since your mama left? Nothing to cook. Mmm-hmm. Ain't nothing much going on over here, either. Somebody dropped artichokes on my pizza today, ungodly decision. Artichokes are good for you. Everybody keep telling me that. Those aren't so good. Everybody keep telling me that, too. But what they don't know is crying about it ain't good for they health. You're so tough. Take one to know one. You think I'm tough? One drop toughens up your skin. You've been telling me that for a while. Get your math right, though. Some of the blood left you when she left. But don't listen to the rants of an old woman. I just call it like I see it. Life too short to play make believe. I missed you, Mama. Private party? No, just keeping me company. Giving me wisdom, you know? I sure do. Levi. This poor girl wasting away on PB and J without the J. Why don't you take her on inside and get her some of that gas pizza? Lord knows I'm done with it. No, that's fine. Now, shut now, you already said you like it. We gonna put your money where your mouth is, huh? Thanks, Mama. Oh, I can hold my own. Most of the time. Oh, Lord. How's ya... Ya pa, child? Okay. Don't lie. We all lie. Isn't that what we do now? From your mouth to God's ears. He's fragile. So are we all. He just wears his on the outside. The meds help. They make him tired. Um... He had to take a different job. The partial disability helps. We get by. At least the house is paid for. But that's probably TMI. He got that TMI? That's one of them new diseases? [CHUCKLES] It means too much information, Mama. [ALL LAUGHING] Shut. Both of y'all. Didn't say anything. Since when anybody gotta speak to say anything around here? But it is nice to see you two back together again. Glad you're happy about it. Lincoln is rejoicing, too, with Jesus. Yeah, that's right, I said his name out loud. 'Bout time somebody started to. Not healthy, all this silence around here. Oh, Lord. Both ends starting to reject it now. I should've stuck with that fruit pizza. Come on, Levi, get me on inside before I explode out here on this porch. Yes, ma'am. Lord have mercy. I'm telling you. Child, back in 1960... No, no, that's all good. No need to share. Oh. That's TMI, right? [ALL LAUGHING] Come on. You can bring my walker in behind me. Yes, ma'am.Okay. There is a slight chill in the air as you heard from Raindrop Bob in his report. So get ready, looks like there is a storm coming. In other news, two youth in North Carolina are brought to trial for pushing a young girl down a storm drain. Authorities are calling it a hate crime. [ENGINE REVVING] Jesus! Bri, whatever is said right now, just stay out of it, okay? What the hell is going on here? Dad! Get in the car. No, Dad. Get in the car! Dad, wait! So this is what got your mother upset? I don't know is it? What are you doing on a Saturday night? Boy. This ain't over. This part is. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Had to happen eventually. I'm so sorry, Levi. It's all good. No, it's not. There's no excuse for that. Not that. But the rest. Just feels good to be free. Enough to write a song about it. Let's do it. Yeah. [CHUCKLES] Hey, Dad! Hey, Bri. Wow, you sound happy. You know what? I think I am. Nice change, huh? Very nice. Say, can you help me with this? Yeah. Thanks. Wonder Girl. Woman. Huh? Wonder Woman, Dad. Not 14 anymore. Oh, yeah? Uh, we're good on milk and stuff. I went to the store and... Sometimes I just wish she were here, you know? She could talk to you about things I... I don't know how to talk to you about. She sucked at it anyway. You're doing great. In fact, uh, you're doing so great I want to talk to you about something. Oh, yeah? Well, I don't know about that, but what's up? You know I'm here for you. And I'm here for you. How would you feel about going to a counselor? Huh? Uh... Well, uh... Look, I mean, I know they're nice, but you know, I'm already taking too many pills and I'm shaky, I need to focus at work. I was thinking maybe not that kind of counselor. Just someone you can talk to one on one without having to be prescribed something. [SIGHS] I was talking to Levi and... You mean you were talking to Levi? When? No, Dad, it's okay. He talked to me first. We sort of came to an understanding. We've even been writing music together. And he's been teaching me to read music. It's pretty cool. To have someone to talk to. Oh. Anyway, he told me about this gal at his church. She's a pastor but also a licensed counselor. He said she helped him through a lot. And I met with her too, and she's pretty cool. Did you tell her about me? About what happened? Yes. Oh. It's not her place to judge. It would really help you, you know? Talk to someone. Don't I have to go to church there? No. It's totally for anyone who needs help. Ah. Three or four on that day. Three, Dad. Oh, yeah. Anyway, um, I spoke with her and she's totally open to meeting with you. I even made you an appointment. I can cancel it at any time or you can, but I hope, I pray you'll consider it. I haven't been to church in a long time, Bri. Doesn't mean you don't believe. [CHUCKLES] You have her wit. I missed that. Please, Dad, talk to someone. Please, Dad. It'll help. I'm tired, Bri. Okay, um... I will seriously think about it. Thanks for thinking of me. I'm always thinking of you, Dad. Singing about me? Everything seems to come up in a song one way or another. [DOORBELL RINGS] I'll get it, Mom. Do we have to wait for Daddy or can we go ahead? Ladies. I think you know this stranger. Honey. Aren't you gonna welcome baby B into your house like you would any guest? It took a lot for her to trust to come through this door. Brianna, let me go and, uh, set another place setting for you. Mother. She can sit next to me. Come here, Bri. Follow me. It's not you, B. She just waiting on Daddy to show up and pray. Mmm-hmm. Every night we wait seven minutes or at least until the food gets cold in hopes that he is going to show up. Every night, every day. Tick. Tock.Lucia. The truth hurts, Mother. Levi. Go ahead. LEVI: Father God, thank you for your grace, your mercy and your hope. Thank you for our guest today, Lord. Bless the food to nourish our bodies. In Jesus' name... ALL: Amen. Mama. I'm a growing woman.Mmm-hmm. You practicing at being grown. Now, I don't know about the rest of it. Ha, ha. Mama got jokes. [LAUGHING] Anyway, what did you learn in school today, child? That Suzanna Moore is a liar and a boyfriend stealer. Can't steal what ain't available to you, honey. I didn't know. Nobody told me. Everybody knows that, Lucia. Doesn't matter. She had a nice little surprise in her locker today. Oh, my. LUCIA: Mmm-hmm. Yeah, she was crying and fussing on. Kicking and screaming. They had to escort her out. MAMA: Well, serves her right. If she not guilty. Oh, she's guilty. Right, Bri? Uh, I mean, kind of obvious, but I'm not sure. What are you talking about? She made out with half the football team. Ooh, child. Just half. The other half is the basketball team. MAMA: Oh, no, child. Now that's what you call, back in my day, a lady of many colors. [ALL LAUGHING] Is that why they called you colorful back in the day, Mama? MAMA: Oh, you stop that, girl. Hush now. Don't be spreading that rumor around. Back in my day, now, I was... Bootylicious! LUCIA: Bootylicious! What the hell is going on in here? Marcus. Shut up, Margaret. Dad. You shut up, too. Someone tell me why she at my dinner table. Marcus. I said shut it up. LEVI: Dad, stop. Someone better tell me why she's at my dinner table. Maybe I should go. No! You're not going anywhere. It's always like you, Levi. Getting in business that don't belong to you. Stirring things up. This is my house. And this is my table. [MARGARET CHUCKLING] Woman? Mama? It's mother. Mother. Mother. Mother! Mo-ther. It's your table? Hmm? It's your table? Look at you. You disgust me. I'll do what I have to do. But no more. No more! No more dealing with this false pretending! False pretending. Margaret. Don't you freaking even fix your mouth to Margaret me. You dirty, slimy dog. [CRYING] I had enough! I gotta, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta stand here and watch her sit in my dead son's chair. He ain't sitting here smiling. She is! Get up! And you. Just say whatever you want out of your mouth like it doesn't affect me. And then you. I'm talking to you, Levi. Yeah, you're not going to get off easy either. Golden boy. I got to watch you giggle it up. Like it's a joke. And bringing her here. And Mama, you go ahead and you look off into the sunset. The first time in how many years that your mouth is finally quiet? But you know what? Most of all I'm tired of you. You disgust me in so many ways. You know why? 'Cause you left me here to grieve the death of my son all by myself, while you went out there and entertained every woman you could. You're disgusting. You're not a man! I can't take it anymore. Oh, God. Oh, God. Mama, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it. I'm sorry. I love you. I love you, Mommy. LUCIA: I'm so sorry. MARGARET: Oh God, please. I just want my baby back. I'm tired. I'm tired. [THUDS] Who the hell do you think you are bringing her up in here like that? Whatever it is it's ten times more than the man you'll ever be. Oh, yeah? Well, I'm going to get her out of here right now! Stop! Somebody stop them. Somebody stop them. Please. BRI: Dad! Don't you come back in here again. Don't you come back. Get your hands off of her. Come back here. Huh? Huh? [GRUNTS] Go! Get out of here. LEVI: Are you okay? Dad! No, stay back. Daddy! BRI: No, stop! You want some of me, Steve? Huh? Stop! [GRUNTING] You're killing him! No! Stop! Please! Let him go. You want to know what's wrong with me? You got the nerve to ask what's wrong with me? You know darn well what's wrong with me. You killed my boy. LUCIA: Let him go! You killed the one that carried this family. You killed the one that was good. No! Then you sitting there like you all good and you're sorry. But sorry doesn't bring him back! I'm going to break your neck, Steve! [GRUNTING] LEVI: Let him, let him go. You're killing him! You want to try your father, huh? Stop! You're a big man now? [COUGHING] You want to come at your father like that? Huh? Daddy! I never did like you. LUCIA: Daddy, stop. Marcus! No, Dad. I'm going to take your head off! Dad, stop! You need to get control of yourself. Stop. I wish it was you that day that got hit with that car. Oh, my God. You should have been the one. I wish you were dead! MARGARET: Marcus! No, no! MARGARET: No! No! No! Oh my God. Levi. MARGARET: Levi! Daddy why? Oh, my God. Mama, what did I do? What did I do, Mama? [LAUGHING] Well, Mother, when you done cutting up out here with the youngins, come on in, 'cause dinner's almost ready. All righty. All right. And, Bri, of course you know you're welcome to stay. Yeah, baby.Thanks. Now, where was I? Oh, yeah, skating. That's easy, even a girl can do it. Hey! Bri, I guess I'll show... Uh-oh. Uh-oh. That girl shouldn't be on that board though, should she? She gone kill herself. She can handle her own, Mama. All righty. Mmm-hmm. Look, I can't take this anymore. You can't take it? Where are you going? You going to see her? I can't take you anymore, Sara. Now just stop it and let me go. Daddy, where you going? I gotta get away for a while, Bri, I'll be back. Run away, Steve. Just run away from your responsibilities just like you always do. Oh, fine. Run away, you son of a bitch! I can't take it, all right? Go! Bri, watch out! Lincoln. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

I'm gonna miss you a little. Time to put you down. What? Nothing. Just time you stop wallowing. Started acting neighborly again. Been a long time since I sat on this swing. [BOTH LAUGHING] Feels good. Yes, it does. Mmm-hmm. Mama always know better. Mmm-hmm. You know, baby, it was time. Doesn't make it all better. Hasn't that poor child been in pain long enough? And haven't you? So why don't you go on over there and make amends, 'cause it sound like what was said needed to be said a long time ago. Go on over there and make amends, child. Don't let that devil get all up in here no more. I love you, Ma. Hi, Brianna. I brought something to eat for you and your father. It's not much and I know it doesn't make up for what happened, but I just figured you know, maybe you guys would want something warm to eat. Thank you. Are you okay? I offended you, and you ask me if I'm okay. I... I didn't mean those things I said about you, Brianna. That was hate talking. Not God. For three years I sat there and I set a place setting for Lincoln. In my mind, he was coming back. I thought I would see him running through the door, telling me a funny joke. He always does. Then sit down and take his place next to his brother. But last night, when I saw you sitting in his setting... Lincoln saved you, Brianna. He saved you. My boy is a hero. He's a hero. And I can't be a happier mother. I want you to know that. And I'm sorry. I'm just, I'm so, so sorry. I just need you to forgive me. I just need you to forgive me. I forgave you a long time ago. Yes, sir. I'm gonna miss you. Well, maybe just one more. LEVI: It isn't a hit. But you may get it in a catalog. Levi! I knew you missed me. Ow! I'm sorry. Too soon? No, just giving you a bad time. How are you? I'm good. Teachers let me make up all my school work, so that's good. Dang, should've thought of this a long time ago. He's got jokes now? What else is going on? Well, Dad's out of jail, but Mama won't let him back in the house. If she ever does. Skirting around a lot as Mama puts it. That's a deep wound to heal. So, how are the songs coming? Is that all you can think about? No, but I been sitting in the past for way too long. Lucia's thinking about joining the dance squad. I think she has a good chance. I know she does. Your mom's been bringing us meals every day. I heard that rumor. Got broken bones, not a broken brain. Not any more broken than it was before. How are the songs coming? Jeez, one track mind. Driven. I haven't written anything. You stopped writing? That's dumb. Not as dumb as you inviting me to dinner that night. Not to sound like a jerk, but I didn't invite you. What? I mean, I would have. But it wasn't me that invited you. But I got the note. I saw it underneath my door when I came home from the store. It said, "Come to dinner. All clear." It wasn't me. Then who? Dang it, Mama. She's such a... Takes one to know one. So, what about the music? Yeah, what about it? Welcome back, Levi. You ready to get to it? I am so ready, sir. Good. You think it's a good idea? I think it's the best timing ever. Mama, Lucia, and even Mama is going to be there. It's going to be so much fun. I hope my dad can come. How's he holding up? He took a real hit. He's been out of work for two weeks. His nerves are shot. The meds don't help. Just... I know. Dads are the biggest struggle. Lord, I hope I don't end up like that. That's where free will comes in, boy. Too good of an imitation. Kind of spooky. MAN: All right, so what do you guys call a bagel that can fly? A plane bagel. [ALL LAUGHING] MC: That was great. That was great. That was great. Thank you. Thank you, guys, for coming out to this showcase of some of our best talent. We would like to conclude the evening with one final song. This song is special. It's been a rough few years. But with our faith in God, we've learned that all things are possible. We never knew we would be up here playing together. You see, we've been neighbors since we were born. AUDIENCE: Aw. Yeah, he's been bugging me for years. True. But it's hard to be bugged by somebody that's as beautiful as this lady has become right here. ALL: Aw! But seriously, this is for our friend. Our brother, Linc. He's no longer with us. But we know where he is. We miss him. But we also know that we will see him again. This is for you, Linc. ♪ Your sacrifice paid the price ♪ For all of me ♪ Your sacrifice paid STEVE: I tried. ♪ For all of me I'm sorry.

Dad, what's wrong? Do you need to sit? No, I'm fine. Bri. Bri, I haven't been fine in a long time. It's like God reached down and pulled a mask off my face. Sweetheart, I was just about to... Jesus, please forgive me! [CRYING] I was so caught up in my guilt. If I hadn't cheated on your mother... If I kept my composure, then Lincoln would still be here. It's okay, Dad. He saved you from me and my selfishness. He stepped out when I was about to... How can I ever repay him? Lincoln saved you. Oh God, please help me. I'm so sorry. BRI: You can't repay him. But you can thank him someday. In the meantime, you can honor him by how you move forward. Mom's gone, Dad. You are stronger than you think. You stayed. You have so much strength. You just need to activate it. You are so strong, Bri. That's just it. I'm not. It's who is in me that is. In my own strength, I'm so weak I can't handle anything. God saved me that day because he wasn't done with me. He's not done with you, either. I need you! I need you. Enough. Let's both get on with life. No, no minor chords. Don't be so major about it. You're so pun-y! That was so lame. I know. My brain's fried from all these chords. You want to take a break? Yeah. Not what I meant, but I'll take it. Hold this. Don't start something you can't finish, little sister! Hold your water, child. Looking all fine for his woman. Mama, trust me. That's what you said 22 years ago when he walked up here the first time. Well what's up, man child? Hi, Mama. Hello, Margaret. I think I'm just gonna go inside, see what's shaking on the wheel. Look like God not done with you yet, my son. I'm not done with him yet either, Mama. Oh, that's a good answer. Good answer, boy. Good, good answer. Oh, God is good all the time. Yes, ma'am. All the time, God is good. Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed. I gotta go practice for my Vegas bus trip. You know, on the wheel, big money, big money. Gloria be in the bathroom all the time, so I can't be doing that. You know? Y'all go on. Mama, Mama. This is for you. All right, now. Mind if I have a seat? Oh, I didn't say you could have a seat. You can have a seat. Yeah, it seems like I forgot a lot of things. I been working with a counselor at church. But all I'm asking for now, Margaret, is for you to give me a chance to show you I've changed. You know, Levi has been pleading your case, too. I don't know why. Yeah. I know it's hard to go back to that night. It was pain that led me down that rabbit hole that I thought I couldn't get out of. All the extra I tried to fill it with didn't heal the hurt that was within me. Like Levi said, we've been working out him and I. Mmm-hmm. He says, "Pop, you gotta let the pain go "if you going to move forward." And now I... When Lincoln died, a part of me died. You know we all had those thoughts. Who should have been the one to take the loss? I took so much for granted. You know what my mother would say? You just buttering my toast. She would. She would say that.Mmm-hmm. I miss Mama. I miss you. I want to earn your heart. And your love. I mean... You'll always have a special place in my heart. Just don't know if I can trust you with it again. I deserve it. But I'm not going to lose you. Not forever. Well, I have a gut feeling that you really mean that, too. I need to go put these in some water. You, uh, mind if I wait? For you? You can stay for dinner if you want to. It's only pizza. MAMA: And none of that fruit or weird anchovies or artichoke things that make you pass gas. I can't take it. Just a plain pie. Please, that's all an old woman is asking for! All right, Mother. Thank you, child. Can we buy... E! Always order an E, you fool. How'd they even get you on this show? What do they do, pick these people up off the streets? I'll be back.Okay. Just got to do the extra step. I'll be here. Daddy! Oh, my God. Hey, baby girl.Hi. Wet! Jesus! Are you staying for dinner? Your mom invited me. Yes! Score. [BOTH LAUGHING] Hey, Steve. Hey, Marcus. Look, uh... We don't have to do this, Marcus. Yes, we do. We have to do this. And we're going to do this. Friends? Friends. You got my back? I got your back, man. I got your back. And your family's, neighbor. Neighbor. Come here, man. All right. You got it. I'm not gonna help you. No, no, no, no, no, unless we do my car next. You're all right. All right. Oh, God is good all the time.
