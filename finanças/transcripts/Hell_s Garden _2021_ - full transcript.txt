In every world, be it politics, show biz... companies or schools, there exist "factions." Female office workers are no exception. A peaceful exterior can hide fierce factional war. Like this. Got it, bitch? You're a billion years too early to be acting up, Wimp! Shall we? My uniform is wrinkled. Wimp. The Satake faction controls the Sales Department. They're led by Shiori Satake. Once a tough queen in control of five high schools. An unbeaten fighter. Capable of anything if she snaps. Hence the nickname Mad Dog Shiori. In gang comicbooks... Mad is a common name for the violent type. As a rookie... she quickly sought out the strongest chicks in Sales... and crushed 'em all. On her first day, she formed her faction. And looked to dominate the company. But standing in her way was Shuri Andoh R&D. AKA "Shuri the Demon" A notorious ex-boss of three biker chick gangs. She was even scouted by the yakuza. She caused a riot on her first day in the office... when sailed into the bathroom by senior ladies... and beating them to a bloody pulp. Mad Dog Shiori's Satake faction. Demon Shuri's Andoh faction. These two main forces have fought each other repeatedly. But today, finally, the two bosses meet. Satake, you "disciplined" one of ours. What about it? Would you like to receive the same treatment? Don't get excited, Shorty. Just shave your head, beg for mercy and pay us a million yen! Very funny, Clown! I'll make sure you can never do Pilates again. How do you know I do Pilates? You go first. I'll have tea. That route. - Go ahead. - Yeah? This one. Just as I thought. With Demon's victory, Satake was now under Andoh control. But that didn't mean Andoh had total domination of the company. There was one mere in Manufacturing. WeIcome back, Commander! Welcome back! The firm actually has three factions. Satake, Andoh and Kanda. The largest and most militant faction is run by Etsuko Kanda. AKA "Etsuko the Beast." Undefeated in 300 one-on-one duets. Six months ago, she was besieged by another firm's "ladies." She went to jail for nearly killing five of them. Today marked her triumphant return. Andoh's path to company domination must go through her. What a cool hobby! Today, history will be made. You're back. You the welcome committee, Andoh? What brought this about? Isn't it obvious? I plan to make you a valuable game piece in my ambition. Me a game piece? Yours? You've grown funny in my absence. I'll show you funny, Smartass! Pipe down, Peon! Hey Andoh. Learn your place or I'll stomp you to bits! Bring it on! I'd like to see you try! I lost all my text threads when I got this new phone. Yeah, same here. Lose anything important? Come to think of it, no. Me, neither. Ladies? Hello. No way! Listen up! I am the strongest! With Shuri Andoh's victory... the split power structure in our office changed... and the Andoh faction ruled the roost. In the world of office ladies... might makes right. Where only a true woman's woman can rise. But... not so for us ordinary girls. jigoku-no-hanazono -Office Royale- My name is Naoko Tanaka, 26. Ordinary employee at Mitsufuji. What an episode. Of Love P.I.? I'll watch it tonight. Then I won't spoil it. Anything exciting? There sure were! Tell me. I'm curious. - What? - Seriously? I don't care about spoilers. Won't it ruin the fun? I hate to be kept wondering. I see. I need a drugstore. I'll wait. Come on. Hang out with us. I can't. Why not? - Stop. - Come on! He's cute. Don't be such a killjoy. Satake faction girls They're harassing Mr. Matsuura of Human Resources. Stop touching me! Ow, ow, ow! You broke my arm! Look what you've done! You've committed battery. That's straight out of a comicbook. Should I call the police? It's busted. Just let him go. You've annoyed him. Who are you? Look, Sister. Nice look, but watch who you mess with. Hands off my clothes. I just bought it. I'm gonna kill you! Sonofabitch. You're free to go. Thank you. Comicbook appearance, comicbook strength. Sorry, the checkout line was long. No problem. Let's go. Can we make it? Let me introduce our new mid-career hire, Ms. Hojo. Ran Hojo. I was in sales admin at my last firm. Nice to meet you. Comicbook turn of events. Which means... Of-course. Take your seat. You. Oh, it's you girls! Same company, huh? Nice to meet you. Follow us. What a surprise seeing you here. Yeah, we owe you some payback from earlier. What're you doing? - Instagram. - Instagram, my ass! - You're coming with us! - Why? Don't underestimate us. That's an order. Underestimate you? Why should I follow orders from people weaker than me? Are you stupid? Peons shouldn't get cocky. You have two ways to make me comply. By physical force, or by bowing your heads and asking nicely. Which will it be? I've got things to do. Tell General Affairs we need more tea. Yes. Do it. So you tried physical force and she beat you up again? Sorry. Sorry. I see. Fine. I'll go meet her myself. Last one gets the fan. Well hello there, Newbie. Hello. You are? I'm Sales department leader Shiori Satake. I'm sort of their senior colleague. Oh. Can I help you with something’? I'm here to return the favor for your assistance. What? Like a present? Something like that. How about a trip to the hospital? Three months for full recovery? A punch like this doesn't make much of a gift. Nice weather! Good day. Good day. -You all-right, Ms. Shiori? -No way! - It can't be! - Ms. Shioiri! -Carry her! - Got it! Dethroned already? The new kid in town appears to upset the power structure ? Classic comicbook plot! Needless to say, what followed... I'll condense into digest form. Satake defeated. - Shiori was dethroned? She also met Etsuko the Beast's revenge... and squashed it. And ultimately, Demon Shuri, too... proved no match. Any others above her? May as well/fetch her. Then are we done? I just got my hair done. What a mess. Anyone got a comb'? Thanks. Much obliged. Hey! What? What are you? Isn't it obvious? An office lady. Like a comicbook plot, the newbie conquered the firm on Day one. Several weeks passed. With the leadership hierarchy now dear in both worlds... nasty battles disappeared from view. But there was orfe surprise left. What was it? Did you see Love P.I. yesterday? I did! The plot thickens. It's so entangled! She and I became good friends. Crazy love triangle. From a week ago. What, what, what? Thank you. Same firm, right? Yes. If you ever need help, I'll protect you. After that, we got to talking a lot. Taking the same bus, our friendship grew. - Made it. - Barely. I'd always my distance from that other world. And she was just an ordinary worker. This side's missing. You did it. You're amazing. She wasn't great at her job, but she was honest. I grew comfy with her as a friendly co-worker. But she was always in demand from- the other world. You're Ran Hojo? Who asks? Mao Shiratori, head honcho at Wakui Trading. Never heard of her, Buzz off. Word is you've made a pretty name for yourself here. I said buzz off, Maggot. I hear you're one tough cookie. I'm the strongest in these parts. I don't give a damn. Buy our lunches as penalty, for the interruption, and disappear. Step outside or I'll make a scene here! I'll be right back. Sure. So sorry. No worries. She wants to buy us lunch. Really? Out of 2,000? I feel so bad. This happened a lot. Dressess like that only look good on models, right? Definitely. I hear you're Mitsufuji's Hojo? Maybe another color? We're the Oshiba Sisters of Yazawa Foods Inc. You must've heard of us. "The War Gods of Yazawa!" Which would you buy? If I had to, I guess the pale blue. Agreed. Can we drop by Lumine? Buying something? Face toner. Oh, right. Shops close at 9 p.m. Ran! Momoka! What's wrong? Back there. Got in a fight with Takaguchi Co. Ten of them appeared. There were only three of us. Pissed off, I told them... "Don't diss Mitsufuji". So they said, "Bring your boss." Understood. Sorry, Nao. Will you excuse me? Sure. We'll go another time. No, I'll be done quickly. Mitsufuji losers! Come back in 800 million years when you're ready to take us on. Kaede Shindo, Takaguchi Trading Co., Ltd. Go and tell your head bitch Hojo... her dirty peons are not allowed to scurry through our territory. At least not without a leash! Who are you? Hojo of Mitsufuji. You asked to see me, but make it snappy. I'm shopping. You two okay? Sorry, Ran. Don't worry. I'll avenge you now. Well, hurry up. You need to die quickly before the stores close. You outhouse flies. So you're Ran Hojo. You've got nerve. I'll honor that and give you a duel with Takaguchi's Kaede Shindo! Forget that. I'll take you all at once! You're wasting my time, Bush League. Bush League? Let's destroy this bitch, Ladies! Sorry. Done so soon? Is Lumine still open? We're good. Great. Let's go. But I'm used to it now. It's my bad for being a slow worker. You knew you were slow? Compared to you, Nao, yes. When you're so good at fighting. The thing is... this food isn't spicy at all Is it supposed to be here? "Spicy stir fry." It's not spicy in the least. Ran, may I? What? The Takaguchi, Wakui and Yazawa Food bosses all want in under us. Do we incorporate them? Sounds like a hassle. They've all come heads bowed in unison with their territories. It's an opportunity. What say you, Nao? Who, me? Let them in? Your honest opinion. It's always good to have more friends. Agreed. Let them in. We'll have Shiori and Etsuko They're management now. Got it. - Sorry to disturb you. - Not at all. It's more sweet and spicy. Yeah, it tastes okay knowing that. I'm not complaining. None of this should affect me, anyway. It's late. I'll see you later. See you tomorrow. I'm glad Ran's adjusted well. Me too. She's outgoing so it's fun. She's even popular with the squares. She's nice. But more than that... Hello. Matsuura's so cute. - Yeah. - Is he seeing anyone? - He must be. - Really? I want a boyfriend. He's too cute not to. But viewing myself objectively, I get worried. I'm the comicbook hero's boring friend. I like Ran... but I d rather not be a character in "that" world. In comics, / usually get entangled. Say an attack in a dark alley. Put her in the car. "We have your cute colleague." "Come alone at 9 p.m...." That's Ryoko Akagi's company. "Come alone at 9 p.m...." That's Ryoko Akagi's company. Devil Akagi. Once they target you, they'll do anything to crush you. With five times our number, too. And stock exchange listed. We made a troubling enemy. It was an inevitable clash with Ran's name rising. But kidnapping is harsh. What do we do, Ran? We're with you if you go. We'll gather as big of a force as possible and have at it. I'll call Shiratori for support. Wait. I'll go alone. That's crazy. That's their demand. What choice is there? They could be hiding in numbers. It's too risky to go alone. It may be risky, but they've got Nao. I know how you feel about her, but you're our boss. If they beat you, we become theirs to control. Well, I'm not abandoning her. Let me go. I'll free Nao and see what happens. No, I'll go. We can't risk our Number 2, either. In an all-out war, we need your command. Hold it. I think you're all misunderstanding something. This is not the military. I don't consider myself above you. Shuri, Etsuko and Shiori, you are my co-workers. So there's no boss or any expendables. What's more... Nao is the least involved with this. She's the only priority. Therefore, as requested, I have to go alone. Understood. In exchange, if it gets bad, call us immediately. And besides... I'm not going to lose. It's me, remember? Will she be okay? Yeah, she will. She prefers doing things herself, even times like this. I didn't mean that. She crushed that can. Her hands must be sticky. I'm sure she'll wipe or wash somewhere. And she didn't recycle. - She didn't. - You noticed? I knew she tossed it in flammables, but I hesitated to say. Me, too. You, too? Evening. Evening. - Any hot water? - Plenty. Great. I need some coffee. - Everything okay? - Yes, fine. I let my guard down. This is where the useless friend causes trouble for the here. I am so totally lame! I've become the most annoying comicbook character. What now? Pardon me. Am I in a hostage situation? I think so, yeah. What should I do to be released? Thai all depends on my boss. I see. By the way, who would that be? Ryoko Akagi, Tomsun Co., Ltd. Frightening. What does she do? General Affairs. General Affairs... An lady? Obviously. Not really. Yeah. Have you awoken, Miss? Yes. Sorry for the rough treatment. Blame your friend. Excuse me. What? What will you do with me? Let me see. Theoretically speaking, it's this. Ms. Hojo will come alone, after which we'll beat her silly. We'll then own your company, and that's it. But I don't expect your top chick to some alone. In that ease, I have you as a bargaining chip. I understand. Typical story pattern, which means... she'll come alone, of course. She's the hero after all. Where's Nao? Nao! Here. You all right? I'm sorry, Ran. Sorry to involve you. I'll save you now. Welcome, Ran dear. Look how you came alone, undaunted! You told me to. I met my end so let her go. Relax. Let's have some fun. Nao's innocent, jerk! Let her go, Watch your mouth! Silence! I keep my promises. But first, in this corner...! "Clash! Melee Medley!" This is where Ran takes on three of my top aides one by one. Can Ran defeat our company's proud elite? What a pain in the ass. Send them all at once so I can get to you. Save the trash talk for AFTER you win. Ready? Appear! Tomsun's Three Musketeers! Appear? They've been sitting there. First is this she devil. "The Seven-Fisted Woman," Sanae Kudoh! She's a toughie, Ran. Can yow beat her? Pathetic. Hojo. I regret to say... this is where you end. Uh-huh, the words of someone before defeat. Nobody will interfere. Feel free to kill each other. Ready... fight! Yes, just two more. Not bad, Ran Dear. Next up then! "The Shimonoseki Pufferfish," Mari Fujisaki! So she's expensive pufferfish. Well, Ran. How will you face her power? Will you shut up, Blabbermouth? This is your end, poor thing. You're just repeating the same line. You die. Ready... fight! Forget these three. What comes after? Excuse me. If she beats all three, will it be the boss's turn? Seems most logical. I see. But I doubt she'll beat Pufferfish. Okay, next! Well, Ran. You've reached the third opponent. Last is this woman! "Blue Lightning"... Taeko Saeki! You ripped off a song. My advice? You may want to rest a bit first. I don't need any rest for you. Come get me. Such disrespect. You'll regret that. She must be a total idiot. If Ran's an idiot, she's thoroughly so. That's, how she's able to defy all common sense. Ready? Fight. She's pretty good. But even if she beats Saeki.. Boss Akagi's on another level. Ran's in a different dimension. Okay, done! Give her a hand! She lost? To a third aide? What a mediocre ending? Shouldn't she struggle tout std! win? That's comicbook. That's the hero! This makes her just one of many! I had more events planned. For example, look here! I was going to take her on in Twister. Twister? With what rules? How disappointing, Ran. You could've tried harder. What do we do with her? Let me see. Since they'll come under our rule... have her call their executives. Very well. This is a lame turn of events. Really? Call your company peeps. Right now? Yeah. Unshackle her. Hojo has lost in hand-to-hand to a Tomsun manager. So Mitsufuji comes under Tomsun. Tell your top staff to come for those discussions. Why don't we have them do Twister matches? Great idea. Between colleagues. We'll eat expensive grapes while they fight it out. It's so blue-blooded. Hurry and make the call. What're you waiting for? Hurry. What do I do ? Calling will only make things worse. It's bad enough now. Stop dilly dallying! - Make the call! -You deaf? Make the call! You wanna end up like her? Sis, your whole company's coming under our umbrella. The sooner you call, the better. Is your hearing bad? Make the damn call! What the hell! Why you! Kill her! I've kept it hidden, but I'm a good fighter. Heartbreakingly strong. I don't know why. It's just a God-given talent. What is she? Not bad, Sister. Meet your death! Why you little...! I grew up with only brothers. Their legendary status as local hoods must have rubbed off on me. Call it DNA. She's interesting. Worth killing. My father always said while watching his kids fight... "Naoko the baby has the most potential of all of you." "An ordinary girl, but carried the strongest genes", he says. As a girl, that didn't make me happy at all. But I do know gang comics thanks to may brothers. While other girls read romance comics... I read "Bebop," "Shobaku," "Rokudenashi Blues" and "Crows." That's all we had Blinder! Hey. What are you? An office lady. Hello, Shun? I'm fine. How's Ran? She's still inside. Come get her. Please do. Hello? I can't find her anywhere. The Akagi gang's all beaten. Did she go home? But she really went wild on them. I'll keep calling. See you. Did she go home alone? Looks it. Ran's so amazing. Different level charisma. One against many. Great. But Ran never showed up. You're on a no-carb diet. You've got potatoes. They're okay. But they're carbs. They're vegetables. Yes, but they're also carbs. Really? Did you know that? Nao, may I? What? Still nothing from Ran. You? Not a word. I wonder what could've happened. Yeah. She probably lost her smartphone. Probably. Possible. Sorry to involve you. I don't know how Ran reacted when she awoke to that scene. But I pretended to know nothing. Did you hear what Ran did? In their world, the rumor was Ran had beaten Tomsun by herself. Her legendary stature had risen even mere. Everyone has something they're good at. Maybe it's academics, sports or singing. Even I had something to be proud of. I could fight. Who're you? You're in the way. Move aside. Only cowards hurt the weak. Ran, please. Don't worry. I will protect you. Come on. I'll show you. - You'll be sorry! -We'll be back! Thank you, Ran. Since I could fight, my classmates all relied on me... when harassed by hoodlums or rival school gangs. I always came to the rescue. I took pride in my fists of justice. And I hunted for the comicbooks. Full of heroes, defeating roughnecks. They became my heroes. I began to see myself as a comicbook hero. So I never bullied the weak. And fight only when it's inevitable. Just like a comicbook hero... I took on the role of the clumsy, naive and likeable friend. All while having super hero strength. But I'm no longer undefeated. Like a comicbook hero, I faced the enemy alone. But failed to rescue my friend. That wasn't all. Hey. What are you? An office lady. I witnessed something. An ordinary office lady, Naoko, succeeding where i had failed. I didn't have what it takes to be a hero. I'm just a supporting character... who falls short as a plot device for the true hero to shine. I believed myself the hero. What shame and humiliation! Thanks. Ran didn't come the next day either. What's with Ran? Caught a cold? Probably. Fighting so many people must've exhausted her. No doubt. She's tough. Give her a day or two. She'll be fine. The big incident occured during lunch. Nice company. What're you doing here? This is our turf/ You looking for trouble? That was stupid. We're Tomsun Company. Bring your boss forth! Be snappy. I' should've chosen that. Why did you, then? Ms. Andoh. The Tomsun gang has invaded. Let's roll. What do you want!? Hi! I'm Akagi of Tomsun Co., Ltd. Charmed. What? That crushing you got wasn't enough? Obviously, it wasn't, Stupid. Where's your boss? Ran Hojo took the day off. Hojo? I don't want that peon. Peon? What're you saying? I want the other one₇ Bring me your boss. Ran is our boss, Numbskull. The one who kicked your asses. She did no such thing. She was beaten by Saeki here. What have you been smoking, Idiot? We were beaten by the other one. Bring her out! What other one, Fool? Ran took you on by herself. What bull crap. Nao? Yes, that's the one. Nao. Your boss, right? Nao's our boss? I think this dude is punch drunk. And Ran can’t be beaten. Just bring Nao out here, okay? Come on! Akagi! I'm getting bored here. Who's this now? I'm sorry, Ms. Onimaru. Give me a minute. The legendary Reina Onimaru? World's toughest office lady She's real? Not an urban legend? How insulting I'm not fool’s gold. Reina Onimaru, World's toughest office lady Your strength is so legendary it's only natural. Since we're gathered here... let's recount some of Ms. Onimaru's best legends; Her top three among so many. "Real History! Reina Onimaru Legend" Bring it here, thank you. Are you all with me? Okay. Legend number one! "Reina's unplanned rail trip battle." When traveling the country by public rail... Ms. Reiwa was challenged at a sudden stop... by an office lady horde.. She proceeded to send 322 of them to the hospital. That's a true story? Number two! "24-hour battle: Let fists save the world! Ms. Onimaru stayed up 24 hours... taking on tough customers from across the nation... completing her pledge drive! She collected 3.48 million yen in donations! You mean a shakedown. Number three! "Surprise! Lunch is Served!" Ms. Onimaru paid unannounced visits... to company cafeterias to sample their best dishes. And then fight their leader... receiving a suggestion of who to visit next.. Why eat lunch? All of these stories are true. And she's taken the time to be here today. So hurry and bring 'out this Nao! What'll we do, Shuri? Nothing. Nao is part of the normal world. We can't involve her. She's normal? Don't make me laugh. After the violence she unleashed? Are you nuts? You're the one who's crazy! Our boss is Ran Hojo. With her gone, you'll have to settle for a beating by us! Have fun! Have fun! Take that, you pansy flash mob! Nice trash talkers. Mad Dog Shiori, Etsuko the Beast and Demon Shuri. They're well-known around here. They'd be bosses anywhere else. You don't say. Been to the gym? Not lately. What a waste of money. It's on the other side of the station. A bit inconvenient. You go to the cake shop there. Yeah, belt sweets go to a efferent stomach. You just indulge yourself. That was warmup. Let's get serious. We pound them! Turn them to cream. Ball 'em up to deep fry. Dip 'em in tartar sauce! I'm so sleepy after lunch. I could use a nap. I'm sleepy either way. Me, too. I slept for 12 hours the other day and it's still not enough. Basically, I'm always sleepy. I realized that humans are actually meant to hibernate. We're defying our nature. I blame modern heaters. Good point. Hibernation vacation. That'd be great. Paid? Of course. Still got something in the tank? Absolutely. Yeah. Piece of cake. Okay, then. Sleepy. Nao! - Oh my God! - Come with me! Why? Tomsun's gang has invaded us, and they're winning! What would my going do? You defeated them, didn't you? You're really our strongest, right? Ran isn't here. You're the only chance we have! What are you talkin about? I'm begging you. Help us! At this rate, Shuri and Shiori and Etsuko... are going to get killed! Aya, put this in the locker. How much longer will this take, Akagi? Soon, I promise. I canceled my wax treatment. So you did. Okay, I'll end this. Please wait. I'll end this right new. Listen up, ladies! Attention, please! Can you pick up the tempo? Onimaru's growing irritated. Do this for me. Can you believe that? I'll kill her later for sure. Who's going to go? I'll do it. No, let me. Okay, but first we need to finish off all these losers. Okay. They're tougher than they look. Time to get serious, I guess. Me too, then. They're good. They have more fight than I expected. You three show great guts. Wanna joint us? Don't be stupid. You come join us. You start from the bottom, though. Fools. Ms. Tanaka. I left some fruit jelly in the staff fridge. Help yourselves. We will. Thanks. Ms. Tanaka. There's not much. Don't fight over it. Noted. Thank you very much. Nao, find cover. It's dangerous here. Don't worry. We'll beat them momentarily. Shall we finish them now? Nao, stand back. It's dangerous. You'll be okay. Just rest. At last the freak has wived! You won't be so lucky this time. You made me wait so long my phone's down to 5 percent. Ms. Onimaru. It's her. I've only wanted... to live my life as an ordinary office lady. Say what? To just do my work. Stop by the store after work. Go out for dinner with co-workers on early days. You're babbling. I'd say, "I ate too much. Tomorrow, I go on a diet" I might even get a boyfriend. You're just not out out for that. You've ruined it all! Nao! No way. I'll kill you all at once! Get Her! Go! Is that really our Nao? Maybe we're hallucinating. Blinder! Just what are you? I told you. I'm an office lady! Naoko Tanaka, was it? It's nice to finally meet someone worthy of a fight. You'll regret that? in one minute. Don't panic. Let's take it slowly and enjoy. I've traveled the whole country on business trips. But I've never found an opponent to satisfy me. People calling themselves "The Reaper" or "The Tank." But they're all disappointments. As I squashed them one and all... people started to call me world's toughest office lady. Is your speech going to be long? So impatient. Let me speak since I've come all this way. At any rate, if you beat me.. you'll be crowned "world's toughest office lady" so good luck. I don't want to be called that. Don't worry. You won't. Because I'm going to kill you. What's that? Nao's amazing. She's super strong. It's so supernatural, I can't focus. Not human fighting. Like a comicbook. This is fun. You're a blast, Nao. By far the best I've ever had. Please. Don't die on me yet. That was a pretty good punch. I'm glad I canceled my waxing. Wait a second, am I on the defensive? That's a hoot! Imagine that! I'm getting chills. Good work, Naoko. This is a first for me. But trust me. I'm a long way from being done. You ain't seen nothing yet. Now it's finishes! She did it. She beat Onimaru. Nao! Wow. Toughest fever. And so I defeated Reina Onimaru. I'm the world's toughest office lady. God, I hate that. Several weeks past, and the company returned do normal. The ladies of that having seen the word's best fighter.. lost interest due to the gap in levels. One by one, they quit and became regular office ladies. Of course, I'd been that all along. So I just returned to my old life. Meanwhile... Ran hadn 't returned to the company. One day, Shiori fold me something. Ran lost by trying on her own. She doesn't know how to face us. Looking back now, fighting was all so stupid. Our relationship hasn't changed, so I hope she comes back. You're right. Then several days later. Ran. Where've you been? We were so worried. Two weeks ago. Awesome cake! - So good! - Let's go again! It was featured on TV last night. I should be a regular office lady. Locking good! No, it's not over. I can't let it end here. I can be stronger. To become the toughest office lady, I had to visit someone. Her name is Sayo Nanase. Everyone in office lady gang society knows her as the first "OL." Who the heck are you? Mitsufuji's Ran Hojo. Mitsufuji? An office lady? Yes, Ma'am. What do you want? To become stronger. Than anyone. But why? When you'have such a darling face? What will you do with all that strength? I want to stand atop the OL world. Please. Teach me your secrets. It might kill you. I'm prepared. Change clothes. First show me what you've got. Come on. Try to kill me. Or I will kill you. Very interesting. Right here. You're awake. Your problem... is you don't know what you're missing. Dignity. Dignity? Yes, your fighting lacks elegance. That's not office lady fighting. It's just street fighting. It's obvious to me that you're not... very good at your job. I knew it. Listen carefully. How you conduct yourself during business hours... the basics are all found in there. How I conduct myself? Drafting documents, making copies, answering the phone. You haven't put much care into those activities, have you? That is why you show a lot of unnecessary movement. Leading to fighting without dignity. But your potential isn't so bad. You might be worth the training. Ready... begin! You've reached Mitsufuji. Elbows in. 1,000 more times. Chin down! But don't curl your back. Speak from your belly button. Slow! You're wasting my time! Slow! Ow! Hold it! Stop, ow! You've reached Mitsufuji. Thank you for calling. Inside out? It's correct. You've grown strong, Ran. I have nothing left to teach you. You've attained mastery. Thank you, Mistress! Being an office lady is a way of life. Now go and show that way to the world. By the way, this Naoko Tanaka you spoke of... Where'd you go? Well, she just happens to be my granddaughter. Are you okay Pochi-Pochi? You did so well. I want to travel. So do I. But there are no holidays coming up. Bad timing. Is that no calorie? - Yup. - Don't tell me. lt suppresses fat absorption. The very one. You're dieting. I see you drink it a lot. I do. Does it work? Not sure. Makes me pee a lot. I will never lose again! I'm the toughest! Ran? Where've you been? We were so worried. Fight me. I can't advance till I beat you. What're you saying? We've stopped fighting. Get up. Get up and fight me! Witty that punch, I understood. She d spent the past 2 weeks enduring extreme hardship. It's what the frustrated hero does in comicbooks... to redeem herself. In other words... she's treating me as the last boss. What's so funny? You involve me, go and lose and I'm your enemy now? Shut up! You've been putting on an act. You're one of us! I just wanted to be an office lady, But I can't. Very well', then. I'll kill you. I'll defeat you here... and become the No.1 office lady! Keep dreaming, Bitch! You never be No.1. You're a supporting role! So began the final battle for pride and OL supremacy. The winner would be the hero, the loser a supporting character. Damn you! Ran! Why are Ran and Nao fighting? Stop that, you two! Now that's a fight. Bigger than Onimaru. Ran is stronger. Now the clincher. The winner to be the world's toughest office lady. Nao. It's okay. I'm going to... protect you, Nao. Ran? Let's go. Really? It's between them now. You're right. See you tomorrow. Let's go for coffee. The winner pays, right? Are you kidding? We go Dutch. Cheapskate. Ran! You okay? Why're you all beaten up? Shinji. I lost! Fighting was my only skill! How can I go on? Don't be silly. You don't have to be a good fighter here. I've always wanted to tell you. That's meaningless. - It is? - Of course! It won't raise your salary or get you promoted. In fact, it scares people away. Seriously? Seriously. What's more, I'm crazy about you for things unrelated to fighting. To me, you are... the world's best girl. You don't have to fight. Shinji. I love you, Ran. Shinji! "Game Set" Seriously?
