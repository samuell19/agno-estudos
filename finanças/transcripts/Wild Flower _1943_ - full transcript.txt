Wild Flower All these lands belonged to the Castros. On them lived thousands of families of farm hands. The cattle raised on the plots of the estate... ...was one of the best... ...and most numerous of the region. It was a large estate for just one family. The owners could tour it for days and nights... ...and not reach its boundaries. Few were those... ...who had so much land. On the other hand, many had none at all. However... No one can live without a small piece of land. Love for the land... ...is the greatest, the worst of all loves. I didn't know that back then. Painful days came until I learned... ...that everything men fight over... ...boils down to possession of land. Here's where... ...your father was born and died. And where we got married. The chapel is still here. On that hill. All this occurred... ...many years ago. But it dwells in my heart... ...as if it just happened. It was a morning of San Juan. And there were flowers... even in the briery and caltrops. That great love of ours... ...made of tears and sorrow... ...was to receive God's blessing. I'm afraid, Jose Luis. This seems so strange to me. I have a dreadful feeling of bad things to come. We are so different that... ...your family won't accept me. Don't you mind leaving it all? Losing it all to marry me? You're everything to me. That's why I'm marrying you. That was the happiest day of my life. So much joy enveloped me. I threw myself into his arms. And we kissed. The new life I had dreamed of... ...opened before us. My granddaughter was taken by Jose Luis, Mrs. Clara. And I need to see Master Francisco. Oh, my God. Be quiet, Melchor. This can't be true. My son couldn't have done such madness. He knows his place, his heritage. This time he forgot, Mrs. Clara. So, if you don't mind... I insist on seeing the master. He has nothing to do with you. * And my son is a free man. Are you sure Jose Luis? She has had no other boyfriend. I'm as certain as there is a God in Heaven, Mrs. Clara. Who would dare to court her... ...knowing she was Jose Luis' sweetheart? Look, Mrs. Clara... Since she was this little... ...she'd run through the furrows among the flowers. Only Jose Luis would approach her. Melchor, I know nothing. When he returns, I'll talk to him and let you know. I'm sorry, Mrs. Clara... ...but she's all I have in this life. I'm so proud of her, she's so good. Such a good student. She was about to be the town school teacher. I'm sorry, Mrs. Clara. Well, Melchor, this will remain between us. I'll reward you for it. I want no reward. I want my grandchild. - Where's Jose Luis? - I don't know. - Maybe in Leon. - Look, Clara. He's been lying for days. * Do you realize the magnitude of this? He must be in a terrible mess. This house has its rules, and I won't allow this. He'll soon be back, I think. He must be courting that maid... ...embarrassing himself, and us. He'll be here tomorrow to brand the cattle, Dad. Who asked you? It must be Jose Luis. Don't be too hard on him. - Come in, Colonel. - Is Francisco home? Yes, Colonel. Have a seat, I'll announce you. Tell him it's urgent. Colonel Pe?a y Berlanga is here, Master. - Did he step inside? - Yes, Master. He's in the living room. You fill this house with joy, Ruben. What brings you here? Let's drink cocoa, here's Clara. Forgive me for not accepting, but I just stopped by. - What's wrong? - It's serious, Pancho. Do you know about a journal... ...against General Diaz? No. - Why do you ask? - You see. The Supreme Government... ...took the press that printed it. They executed the editor last night. But there's something worse. Jose Luis is involved in this. Which Jose Luis? - It's impossible. - It isn't. The files include his name... ...in the headlines with Col. Rodriguez. The Revolutionary Movement. Ruben, it can't be true. My son belongs to a decent family. Sorry, I've seen the files. I know who Jose Luis is and what your rules are. But he's involved in this. Now, don't worry... ...I destroyed all the evidence. Thank you. Maybe it's written... ...that our own children... ...will hurt us cruelly dishonor our house. We can't change what's done. He mustn't get involve further... ...and mustn't go to the Revolution. Hey, Pancho. Send him to the U.S. Or Europe. Maybe he'll forget until the danger passes. No. I don't know, I don't know. But I will tell you this. I'll kill him before a Castro... ...becomes a renegade of his tradition and family. I won't allow it. I swear I'll lead that fool in the right direction. Nicanor, Reinaldo. You called, Master? Yes. Find Jose Luis wherever he is. Haven't you seen him? You may find me dumb... ...but we haven't seen him. What do you mean we haven't seen him? Didn't we see him this morning... ...at the foot of the hill with Esperanza? I didn't accept her as his sweetheart. Courting the daughter of a cattleman. That's about all I needed. - Go and get him. - Yes, sir. Well, my friend. They say that God gives plenty... A rabbit will always be a rabbit. Why did you say that? My friend. I thought you had forgotten. Well... Don't call me a rabbit. One day I may lose my grip... ...and beat you to death. Walk, you idiot. The land belongs to those who work it. And dream and suffer on it. Still worried? A little. About my grandpa, you know. He's so good, so honest, so worthy. He may not understand the legality of this. When a decent woman elopes... ...without her parent's consent... ...there's no legality to justify it. You're wrong, Esperanza. Didn't God bless our love? Besides, how else could we have married? If we'd asked our parents... ...we wouldn't be husband and wife right now. I sent word to your grandfather... ...announcing our wedding... ...and that we'd see him tomorrow. Yes, you're right, but... What about your father? And your family? How will they take this? Since I married you, Esperanza... ...you're all that matters to me. They can think whatever they like. No. No, don't say that, Jose Luis. God willing... ...l'll win your parents' hearts over. I'm sure of that. When father comes to know you... ...he'll fall for you, like I did. And so will mother. She'll love you as her own. Master Jose Luis. Go and see who it is. And watch your mouth. You're always shooting it off with sayings. Flies don't go into shut mouths. How are you, kids? All right. Come in, Jose Luis is eating. We'll wait right here. How did you find us? Well, we saw you together on San Juan's day. And we nailed it... What nail, buddy? What happened at the house? Well, yes, Esperanza. Master Francisco sent us to fetch master Jose Luis. Does he know we're married? Holy Mother of God! You got married? You and master Jose Luis? Yes, Reinaldo. - Is there something wrong? - No. Not wrong, but... It will be worse than Judas in hell. Don't jinx them, be quiet. Jinx. No, Nicanor. Maybe I caused the jinx. Because I'm poor, like you. And Jose Luis... ...is the master's son. God forbid this to be the cause for disgrace. Come in, friends, come in. See what you caused with your foolishness? What foolishness? Come on! It's Nicanor and Reinaldo. - Nicanor and Reinaldo? - Yes. Well, come on in. - What are you doing here? - We came to fetch you. I knew you'd find me. Well... You're the first to visit us. By the way, have you eaten? Yes, master, thank you. Then, have a cup of coffee. Stand up, rabbit. I haven't said a word! We can't, Jose Luis. You're the master and always will be. God's law is respected here. No, Nicanor. It's no longer God's law. God made us all equal... ...and that's why the Revolution started. Because in Mexico we want... ...poor and rich to be as brothers. You're my friends, you'll sit at my table. Sit down. You say they're looking for me. May I know why? Well... Master Francisco wants a word with you. - What's it about? - Well... ...we're not sure. But he was furious... ...after talking to Colonel Ruben... ...who arrived to speak with your father. They talked about you. Master Francisco was worried. All right. At the branding tomorrow. I'll take Esperanza to announce she's my wife. Although my friend won't let me speak. It's my duty and... ...l'd advise master Jose Luis... ...to wait until next year's branding. I think Reinaldo is right, Jose Luis. Speaking of branding, did all the cattle arrive? Just a few, master. The Torres brothers... ...attacked the plots and even took the oxen. See you tomorrow at the hacienda. Oh, they truly are pretty. Really lovely, the parties at my ranch. With their mariachis and songs. And these cowboys with big sombreros. So lovely. This sorrel-colored pretty mare. To teach her tricks. And ride her and take the wild out of her. Country parties are so pretty. Its girls and sun are bright. Piece of land that I love. Darling, my heart belongs to you. And this is when. Show him you're a rabbit and ride it. So, I'm a rabbit, my friend? Set her free, boys... ...and I'll show my friend I'm a man. And I don't even have one rabbit's hair. Five pesos she plants you, my friend. Hey, I'm not corn. No, but she'll plant you. Release her, boys. - Holy Mother of God! - You'll see, my friend. Such rearing on her hinds! Wow, my friend, what a trick! Oh, buddy, hold on! - Oh, buddy. - Oh, mother! I won five pesos. The countryside is so pretty. Its girls and sun are bright. Piece of land that I love What happened? You said she wouldn't plant you. - Give me my five pesos. - What? - What, buddy, did you fall? - No, I stepped down. Truth is you were born to be a rabbit and nothing else. Come on, man. Country parties are so pretty. Its girls and sun are bright. Piece of land that I love. Oh, my love, my heart belongs to you. I'm a bit scared. Let's go, Jose Luis. Don't worry, darling, everything will be all right. I hope so. But I'm very scared. Father is worried. Jose Luis' mess is driving him mad. Last night, he couldn't sleep... ...and I heard him get up asking if he had arrived. Don't you think Jose Luis isn't a child anymore? Besides, why can't he be free... ...to love whomever he pleases... ...and do whatever he wants? Are those words for a lady? - Jose Luis. - Mother. Hi, Ana Elena. You know Esperanza, don't you? - Good morning Mrs. Clara. - Esperanza. Sit down, sit. Sorry, I'm going to see father. Jesus, here comes Francisco. Mr. Francisco. What are you doing here? That's the place for cattlemen. Go away, don't embarrass us. Where are you going? Stop it. With her own, where she belongs. What have you done to my wife? What did you say? - Your what? - My wife. Esperanza is my wife, father. She used to be the object of your spite. Now she carries my name. No one... ...not even you, can offend her. - Father. - Son. - Please, behave. - Go away. Go I way, I don't want to see you. I'm sorry, mother. I'm sorry, Father. I regret what happened, but I cannot and will not keep silent. I married them myself. I came to talk to you because they asked me to. Have faith in the Lord. Jose Luis's presence may help save Esperanza. I'm sorry about what happened. I swear it won't happen again. You and I alone... ...will fight the whole world... ...if necessary, to save our joy. But now, what matters is for you to get well, Esperanza. Do you hear me? Nothing will tear us apart. So, you need to get well, Esperanza. Do you understand? Yes, Jose Luis. Yes. Now, let her rest. If you please. Good night. I don't know what to say. I feel embarrassed and guilty. You have nothing to regret, son. This is just a means God is using... ...to prove the strength and loyalty... ...of your love for Esperanza. All right. Not another word. What's done is done, and God knows why He did it. Go and have a drink as you should. Talk as father and son which you now are. Shall we, Mr. Melchor? Mrs. Clara. Where's Esperanza? I need to talk to her. - She is quite ill, Mrs. Clara. - But I want to see her. I think... I said I need to talk to her. Let her in, Father. Please, Mrs. Clara. - Good evening, Esperanza. - Good evening, Mrs. Clara. Please, leave us alone. Ana, make him company. Have a seat, Mrs. Clara. I'll be brief, it's late and you're not well. I'm sorry to see you like this. But this cannot go any further. What happened today proves... ...you shouldn't tie Jose Luis down. Can you see what you've done? How could you drag my son... ...compromise him in front of everyone... ...making his father confront him? God knows that wasn't my intention, Mrs. Clara. His father kicked him out, that's why I'm here. He was kicked out. But... It can't be true. What crime did he commit? Loving me? Marrying me? No. He's reasonable, he'll understand. Understand what? You should understand, Esperanza. You and he are different. Besides... He's our only son, we had dreams for him. Look. Give back the peace to a home that lost it because of you... Give him back his freedom. - You ask me to? - Yes. To leave him. I'll talk to your grandfather. I'll establish a business for him, anywhere. Wherever he chooses. What about Jose Luis? What will Jose Luis do? I'm willing to do anything to... ...spare him the pain of being banished from his home. - But what about him? - He... He'll forget. What about our love? You think you can simply... ...wish it away, Mrs. Clara? Ever since we were little, running in the fields... ...you pulled him from my side to stop him from seeing me. How can I bear to see him part? How can my heart endure his calls? If you had seen how happy he was... ...when he took me to our home. I knew this would cause great pain. And I was afraid. I thought... He comes from so high and I, from so low... My duty was to conquer through love and sacrifice... ...a position that wouldn't shame me in his eyes. When the Priest gave us his blessing... ...everything in the world disappeared. Even myself. And in my soul, there is only Jose Luis. There is no joy for me but to serve him. To guess his every thought. To give him strength. Do you know what I even dreamed? That I was his shadow. Always following him. Kissing his every step. Those are immature dreams. They aren't real, dreams pass. We all have a place in life. People underneath can dream, but will always be below. Have I made myself clear? Below. Do with me what you please, Mrs. Clara. Tell me what to do. I only ask one thing of you. If Jose Luis asks about me... ...tell him I died. I couldn't bear the thought of his misery on my account. I would hear him call at night. Claiming my evil. Evil? No. Why? Maybe someday I'd explain... I'd tell him... Esperanza. Don't look at me so sadly. See? I don't know what I'm saying. I thought I could. But I can't. I'm sorry, child. I was blind. No, Mrs. Clara. You're a mother and you hurt over your son. I have nothing to offer him. I'm so poor. I'll leave. I'll go far away. With my grandfather. Where Jose Luis... ...will never find me. God help me. And you say you're poor? I'm the one who's poor. Thinking of society and money. Now I see why my son chose you. Esperanza. My child. What's wrong? Father. Ana Elena, come here right away, please. Esperanza. What is it, mother? I hurt her, poor thing. Forgive me, child. Forgive me. Hey, Gorgonio. Bring another bottle. This one's on me, Mr. Melchor. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, don't disrespect me. You may be the boss' son, but no one pays for my vices. Especially you, who are now my son... ...and I am your father. Why did you push me, Gorgonio? What's wrong with Melchor? I try to please you and end up ridiculed. Cheers, Mr. Melchor. Look, son... You just hatched from the egg. But I'm quite old. I know very well that stars will fall from the sky before... ...a landowner like your father... ...accepts your marrying the granddaughter... ...of a Mr. Nobody. Social differences don't vanish with good intentions, son. That's nothing but the truth. The difference is so great... ...that even God Himself messed up making some men poor... ...and other rich. But I'll tell you one thing, Jose Luis. All the Castros' money... ...or all the money of all other rich men in the world... ...would be enough to build the gifts my granddaughter has as a woman. She's so kind. So sweet. So pure. That she resembles a flower. Even if it's a wild flower. Why do you think I married her, Mr. Melchor? That's precisely why. I'll bring down the stars. Not to the ground, as you say. But to my wife's feet. You and I will go the hacienda to speak to my father. No, son. What's the use? It's pointless. I'm quite drunk, but not... ...so much as to not know that it's impossible. All this we've talked about. They... ...wouldn't understand. I think they would, Mr. Melchor, my father loves me. And if he doesn't understand... ...l'm also a man and have my dignity. I know how to be respected, you hear me, Mr. Melchor? And no one insults my wife. Not even my father. Come with me, Mr. Melchor. If you please. Let's go, boys. Wild country flower. Such a simple and natural flower. They don't think you're fine growing next to cacti You're not a rose, you're not a lily. Much less a fleur de lis. Your perfume is my torture and with it you give me joy. Like you, my wild flower. There was once a love in the mountains. She never knew of luck but knew much about pain. Humble flower, field flower. Who adorns the briery. I give you my song, angelical bud. While you sleep on the ground. The thorn-bush protects you. And the bluffs and rye make your nuptial line. I always carry your hope. Pretty heavenly flower. I've given you my trust, my little flower bud. Come in, Mr. Melchor. Make yourself at home. Jose Luis. Ana Elena! Where have you been? - With Esperanza. - Look at you. Don't let father see you like this, come. - I need to speak to him. - No, no. He's drunk, some other day, come. - I tell you I must talk to him. - Jose Luis. Father, father daddy. - Daddy. - Get out of here. I said, get out of here. What are you doing here? Come on, out! I'm sorry, father. I drank too much. So you're back? And in what a state! You're a shame to this house. I came back because... Miserable, disobedient son! You have no fear of God. Besides being a revolutionary... ...to your parent's disgrace, now you come in this state. Disrespecting your family, but before I tolerate this offense... ...l'll kill you. Coward. Disobedient son, bad son. Father, father. - Francisco, don't. - Don't hurt him. - Son. - Father. Son. V ile, you're vile. You're heartless. They're outside, master. Excuse me, they're outside. Oh, yes, show them in. - In the living room? - Yes. Are your shoes clean? Not too clean. Come in. So, you want to leave too? Well... The truth is, we do, master. We don't really want to leave. But... But what? You see, master... We were all born here. You know that. You know we love this land. Our hearts are rooted here. Like the wheat. And the maize that grows here. There's no better crop in the region. Even worse. We're like... ...the trees that grow outside. That no one or anything... ...can uproot. To move them from there... ...well, you'd need an axe. But the thing is... Master Jose Luis is gone, and... ...we can't let him go alone. Please remember... That my friend and I... ...were almost his nannies. We taught you to walk. I tamed Casimira, the mare. For him to learn to ride. You see, master. Roots that grow together... ...can never grow apart. Never. Ever. Master Jose Luis and us... ...are like roots. The strongest... ...pulls the rest. That's why we're leaving. To serve him as we've done all our lives. I mean... If you're so kind as to let us go. Go on, boys. And don't tell him you saw me. But first, tell the butler that I said he must... ...you two month's salary. May I take the Winchester? Yes, you may take it. So may you, Nicanor. And the horses, and everything you need. Thank you very much, master. And with your permission... ...we're leaving. Goodbye, master. THE REVOLUTION SPREADS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY MEXICO AGAINSTDICTA TORSHIP PORFIRIO DIAZ FLED THE COUNTRY THE REVOLUTION FIGHTS AGAINSTSOCIAL INJUSTICE PRESIDENTMADERO ASKS FOR UNIFICA TION Halt. Who hails? It's me, Pancho. Ruben. I'm coming. - What is it? - I don't know. What is it? You're hurt, what happened? We suffered a terrible defeat. The whole area surrendered, Porfirio resigned. The Revolution swept away with everything. They sprout from the ground everywhere and at any time. All hell is loose, Pancho. We're running away, I don't want to leave you alone. Those bandits will come. I tell you they've been doing terrible things. It's a punishment from Heaven. I'm not leaving. Don't be stubborn, Pancho. Listen to me. Do you think they'll respect you? You're their worst enemy. You stand for everything they hate. Wealth, tradition, lands. They're trying to shed the last drop of blood... ...of the last landowner alive. No, Ruben. I won't go. Mi life is here, and my dead loved ones, too. That's why we belong to the land. We're... Like these trees... ...that no one can uproot because their roots are too deep. They only fall... ...with an axe. I'll take whatever comes. Whatever God, our Lord, has in store for us. Hey, buddy! Help, I'm drowning. My friend. My dear friend. What happened? Help, help, my friend is drowning. Master Jose Luis, help! Buddy, hold on to the rope, my friend. What happened to you Reinaldo, Reinaldito! Hold on, my friend. - Oh! - Oh! Jesus, he fell again. Master Jose Luis, help me. Esperanza. - Jose Luis. - Master Jose Luis. - Jose Luis, help. - Help us. Reinaldito will drown. Come on, Nicanor. Help me. Reinaldito, are you all right? I swallowed a frog. It's your fault, my friend. - Why did you push me? - Liar! Rabbits always throw you into wells. Come on. Use this blanket. See? Now I have a cold. It'll be your fault if I catch the puerperal fever. Be quiet. Boy, Panfilo. Hey, Nicanor. Yes? Bring guns and ammunition. All right, boy. - How are you? - Hello, Jose Luis. I came sooner than I promised. - Do you have the guns? - They went to fetch them. Hello, cousin, congratulations. Uncle Menchor told me. I swear I'm so happy to see you married. This is how we know... ...that new generations aren't... ...prejudiced as their parents. I told you I was marrying Esperanza and we are at your service. Thank you. How about a drink? Lt'd be great. Please, bring us the tequila. Sit down. All right, tell me. What news do you bring? Lots and quite important. President Madero wants to reestablish peace in the land. The Revolution won, so now comes the hard part. We have to end with the bandits. And that's what I came to say. What is it? The bosses want to have... ...honorable mates like you. To control all this we've unraveled. You, the son of a rich man... ...has set an example to us all... ...who dream of fairer times. That's why I was instructed... ...to beg you to join us. Thank you, cousin. - Cheers. - Cheers. You who feel the Revolution... ...and know these lands better than anyone... ...should help rid it of bandits... ...like the Torres brothers. And many others. Sheltered by our cause they steal and murder. Those are the Revolution's worst enemies. You, who from the beginning helped... ...our cause with money and conviction... ...are bound more than anyone to end this. Look, Panfilo. I'll go with you, but later. I can't right now. I cant' leave Esperanza alone. Jose Luis. Don't worry about me. Either I stay alone... ...or I follow you wherever you go. That's how we speak in Mexico. See, Jose Luis? Even my cousin who's a woman stands... ...at the height of circumstance. - Why don't you? - No, Panfilo. Don't insist. I said I'll catch up. As soon as my child is born. And you know you count on me... ...for whatever you need, as usual. I'll join you as soon as I can. All right, Jose Luis, whatever you decide. But believe me, I'm sorry. I'll leave now. Every minute is precious and there's much to do. We're getting close to those bandits... ...led by the Torres brothers. - Are the guns ready? - They're outside. Well, Jose Luis. I'll see you. - Bye, cousin. - Goodbye, cousin. Remember me when it's time to pick a godfather. Don't' worry, we'll pick you. I could never repay what you've done for me. You fill me with joy. However... I feel sad. You lost everything. Family, social position... ...money, peace of mind. And now, this. You're sacrificing one of your greatest dreams. I'm holding you instead of giving you strength. Many times it's the woman... ...who makes the man a coward. A coward? No, it's all the opposite. What would I do without you? I'm sorry. I'll set the table. I'm taking these 12 men, master. - Are they enough? - Yes, master. Especially when the rest carry their guns. Well, if you don't mind. They attacked a plot again last night. It must be a big group, they killed six men. So, be careful. You're taking almost all our corn. If you come across those bandits... - Burn it. - Don't worry, master. We know who they are. Ursulo and Rogelio Torres, after years of being cattlemen... ...are now road bandits. Jose Luis did well in firing them. Because they are evil. All right, go now. - Excuse us, master. - Yes, go on. Those carts in the front and the mules. Let's go. Now, boys. Hurrah, let's go, go on! Continue, continue, and let's go. Hurry! Jose Luis. You can't sleep, can you? That howling. It gives me the chills. You'd better go inside. It's late, you could catch a cold. No. I'm staying here with you. I can't sleep, either. Tomorrow we'll take you to the doctor. I'd rather see a woman. Or do it on my own. Why spend what we don't have? Many have their babies like that. - Why shouldn't I? - Oh, no... You deserve the best. Master Jose Luis. Master Jose Luis. Master Jose Luis. Master Jose Luis. Master Jose Luis. Master Jose Luis. They killed the master. They've taken the hacienda. What did you say? Speak, speak! Mr. Francisco. Bring me the gun. Take Pedro to look after him. Saddle up and follow me home. They just killed my father. Stay with them, I'll be right back. Let's go. Hurry up, boys... ...for there's no other God than Ursulo Torres. Yes, General. The hanged man is giving me the eye. Excuse me, I'll execute him. Would you like some, General? It's very good. Stop that nonsense. I'm really angry now. I feel my head being tightened. These remedies are so useless. Hey, General. Could it be typhus? It's killed so many people. Don't jinx me. Get out of here, Sico. See if my brother is back. Come on, drink! We haven't killed you because... ...Gen. Ursulo wants you to sing when his brother arrives. He's another one of the great generals. Don't be scared, boys. Now, you're in the company of real men. What are you looking at? Drink! My brother Rogelio is here. You went ahead, Ursulo. Little brother! You're the youngest, and... ...you're making more noise than me. What's wrong, brother, do you have the flu? I don't know. I feel like I was beaten. I feel awful. That's why I came ahead. We cleaned the hacienda and I killed Mr. Francisco. I even sent the boys ahead. I just waited for you. I swear I can't take it any more, brother. Don't worry, you'll go away now... ...to get well. I'll look after everything here. All right, brother. Take a few men to take care of you, brother. My horse. Look, Reinaldo. Stay here and shoot whoever comes out. Yes, master. On a Sunday, while branding cattle, two young men met. Holding their irons as if looking for a fight. As they were fighting, the father of one of them arrived. My dear son, don't fight anymore. Step aside, father I'm angry as a lion. I may pull out my sword and cut through your heart. Dear son, for what you just said, before the sun goes down You will lose your life. I ask of my father not to burry me on sacred land. Burry me in coarse soil where cattle may step on me. With my hand sticking out holding a note in a golden envelope. And a sign that reads: Jose Luis was an unhappy man. The scarlet horse was born a year ago. I leave it to my father for the upbringing he gave me. The three horses I have there, I leave to the poor. So at least they may say: Jose Luis, may God forgive you. They brought down the black bull they had never brought down. But now he came down with all the cattle. With this song I bid farewell. With the star from the East. This is what may happen. To the disobedient son. Mother. How could this happen? Poor thing. Let's get out of here, mother. No. Francisco. Francisco. Oh, my God. Francisco. Should we bring the mistress? No. Let's take mother and Esperanza to town. - Wait here a while. - All right, master. It's a boy, Jose Luis. Poor thing, is she all right? But he's ugly. He's horrible. They're born like that, but they improve. What happened at the hacienda? We'll talk about it later. The blow was terrible for mother. I'm taking her to town, to the doctor. She doesn't recognize anyone. Poor thing. Take her to my grandpa's. As soon as I', well, I'll take car of her. That's what I'll do. Why does he cry so much? Is he sick? Maybe he's choking. Babies cry like that. Take your mother, don't worry about us. I may be away for a few days. Don't worry about me. I know I shouldn't meddle in your decisions. I imagine what you want to do. And I'm afraid. V engeance never ends, Jose Luis. Blood summons blood. Take care. My sister Isabel will be here soon. She'll take care of Mrs. Clara as she deserves. Take her to her house. Don't let the doctor leave her side. Don't worry about her. Jose Luis. I know the law of our land... ...when a loved one is taken away from us. But I'd rather you forgot about this hatred. Not only for Esperanza, but for your son. For my grandson who must be beautiful. You should know that. Don't worry, Mr. Melchor. We'll soon be together again. God willing, son. - God help you. - God help you. - Where was the master? - There. - And you? - Here. Hey, cattleman. You who come from there, tell me. Do you think there's of plague over there? Plenty. It seems like God's punishment. The end of the world. Every house has a soul to mourn. And it's worse at the ranches. No one wants to carry the dead to the cemetery. I can tell you our shoulders are... ...scraped from all the caskets. You should know, my friend... ...that I get the shivers... ...from the very thought of going there. Why are you going there? To heal, what else? I'm a medicine man, and I have a special recommendation. To cure a certain man. Mr. Ursulo Torres. They say he's got a bad case of the plague. I told you, master. My friend is a rascal. Maybe he'll spill it out. Look at that. What could he be talking about? I like your innocence. And I'll tell you the truth. You'd better not go. If you don't get killed... ...General Ursulo Torres will shoot you. The disease seems to have put the devil inside. He shoots his own men. - And they've all run away. - Oh, my God! - How do you know that? - Well... Look, sir, I'm a cattle hustler. I'm his assistant. And I'm running away too. Don't move, I'm not a medicine man. What, what? Don't be a rascal. What? I wont' allow that from anyone but my friend. I'm sorry, General, but all the men deserted. Even your assistant. The truth is that with this plague going around... ...rumor has it that you're going to die. You're just a bunch of cowards. You let them go. Why didn't you tell me? Well, General, we want to go too. That's nothing but the truth. So you want to go too, men? You came for my permission, did you? Well, here it is. They had him. But master Jose Luis wants him alive. And that's what's wrong. He had me. You were right, my friend. I'm nothing... ...but a rabbit. No, my friend, you're no rabbit. You are a real man. No, my friend. You're just saying that because I'm dying. But all my life... ...l've been nothing... ...but a rabbit. Don't move, you bastard. Jose Luis Castro. Mr. Francisco's son. No. No. Don't kill me. Have pity on me, no! No, look at me. Look at the condition I'm in. I'm sick. Don't kill me, no, no! No, no. Don't kill me, no, no. Don't kill me, no, no. Don't kill me. I'm sick. Don't kill me, no, no. For the love of God, don't kill me, no. Forgive me, father. For everything. I may have been a disobedient son, not a bad son. Here's the one who took your life. I came to settle it, according... ...to the laws of our land. Nicanor. Put the noose around his neck. Master. This man is already dead. - What? - He's dead. You disappointed me. I'll hang you anyway so my father can see you from his grave. The rope. Where is he? I said, where is he? Let me go! I said in Leon. No, Jose Luis is close by. He still has the blood of my brother Ursulo on his hands. I told you he left. And he won't be back soon. Yes, well... I'll wait for him here. No. Shut that boy up and feed my men. Did you hear me? We haven't found him yet, General. - Well, keep looking. - All right. Esperanza. Esperanza. - They're waiting for you. - Where? Behind the river. They're only waiting for you. They're sure you'll bite the bait. That bandit. Rogelio Torres was very angry... ...when he heard that Ursulo died. He's spread the word that if by tomorrow you're not dead... ...he'll kill your wife and son. The worst thing is he'll do it, he has no fear of God. He brought many men, Jose Luis. Even Colonel Rodriguez... ...hasn't dared chase them. - Where's Rodriguez? - Here, in town. Behind the bar. God help you, master Jose Luis. Please, Panfilo... Help me. Remember I told you to join us? I could see this coming. In the name of the Revolution... ...the fight for the poor... ...many bandits roam the land. I know what happened to my cousin, I'm sorry. I'm expecting reinforcements from the mountain range... ...to go after Rogelio. We're leaving with them tomorrow. No, Panfilo, I can't wait 'till tomorrow. But you have to. There could be a thousand of them. Don't seek personal vengeance, it leads to nothing. It isn't only Rogelio Torres... ...but all those bandits who infest... ...the country we must get rid of. Listen to me, Jose Luis. Forget about vengeance. All right. If it can't be done... ...well, all right. Jose Luis. Jose Luis. One, two. Long live General Rogelio Torres... ...father of more than four. I'll settle the life of my brother Ursulo. No one knows what he meant to me. We've felt each other's insults as our own since we were little. But I'll tell you one thing. If Castro doesn't bite the bait I laid out... ...l'll kill you and that boy. Do you hear me? I'll kill you and your boy. - Did he fall for it? - He did, General. When he heard we had his wife... ...he headed here like a thirsty horse to water. And that's the truth, General. He headed here like a real man. Offering his life in exchange of his family's. There's only one condition, General. What? That you don't tell the woman. Where is he? At the old barracks. - Should we kill him? - No. The men who killed my brother... ...will get special treatment, with drums and all. Bring him to me. Squad formation. There's a wall waiting for him outside. You've cried for him ever since I took you. Stubborn and loyal to his memory. Well, now you'll hurt over the death of a loved one. Go. You'll see. Stop that thing. Women. Boys. We're going to celebrate, the end always comes to everyone. Didn't I tell you to come out? Come on, out! Jose Luis. Jose Luis. Out, bring her out! Jose Luis. Go away, Esperanza. Please, leave. Go to your grandfather's house. I'm telling you to go. Can't you hear me? Find Colonel Rodriguez to protect our son. I said you should go. Can't you hear me, go away! Squad, ready. Steady. Jose Luis. Jose Luis. Don't kill him, don't kill him, don't be cruel! For God's sake! For our son. Jose Luis. Go away, Esperanza. - Go away. - No, no! I don't want you to see this. - No. - Please, go away. Lieutenant, please, take her away. For the love of God, I said you should leave. No, Jose Luis, no! Hurry up. Don't take me from him, no, no! Don't take me from him! Jose Luis. Take that woman away, or burn her too. Lady. Come on, woman, I'm talking to you. Damn it, let her go! I said, let her go! Let's go, ma'am. - Jose Luis. - Out. Let go of me! No, let me go, let me go! - Hold that woman. - No, let go of me! I want to die with him, I want to die with him! Let go of me! Let go of me! Stand up. I have no strength, Lieutenant, forgive me. I want to die with him. But you have a woman and children. You'll understand. Esperanza. Son. Steady. Fire! No! Now you know the story of this land... ...which is the story of Mexico. As I... ...many mothers in this country... ...felt the greatest joy... ...and the worst pain. Our dead ones lie in this land. My dead ones... ...who are also your dead ones. Son... The blood spilt in so many years of fighting... ...by thousands of men who, like your father... ...believed in good and justice... ...was not fruitless; On it stands... ...the Mexico of today. Where new life flourishes. THE END
