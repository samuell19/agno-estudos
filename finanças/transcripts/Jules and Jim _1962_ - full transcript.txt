You said, "I love you." I said, "Wait." I was about to say, "Take me." You said, "Go away." Jeanne, do you remember when Fran?ois Truffaut first spoke to you about making Jules and Jim? I couldn't tell you the exact date... but we were introduced by Louis Malle... in the corridors of the old Palais du Festival. He got in touch with me right after Cannes. He hadn't yet made The 400 Blows? That was a charming house. I wonder if it wasn't near P?re-Lachaise where we filmed. Maybe it's gone now. As Jules rummaged through the clothes for a slave costume, Jim's friendship for Jules was born. It grew at the ball as Jules looked on, his eyes full of gentleness and good humor. The next day saw their first real conversation. Then they met every day. Each taught the other his language and culture till the early hours. They shared their poems and translated them together. They also shared a relative indifference towards money. They chatted easily. Neither had ever had such an attentive listener. Jules had no girls in Paris, and he wanted one. Jim had several. He introduced Jules to a musician. Things started out well. They were in love for about a week. Then a free and easy girl came along who stayed up all night in caf?s. Next it was a pretty blonde widow. The three went out together. She confused Jules, whom she found nice but clumsy. She brought him a quiet friend... too quiet for Jim's taste. Finally, against Jim's advice, Jules took up with professionals but found no satisfaction there. Truffaut sent pictures of you to Henri-Pierre Roch?. Yes, to get his approval. The reaction was positive. And he must've had in mind... Ah, Marie. Marie Dubois. He must've had Jules and Jim in mind already, but he didn't tell me right away. Well, I talked a lot. We met once a week in a caf? or a restaurant... on a certain street. It was where I'd shot Louis Malle's Elevator to the Gallows. Just off the Champs-?lys?es. I talked a lot, I told stories, I sang songs, because he just loved Charles Trenet like I did. Later he'd write me letters in which he'd respond... to things I'd said at lunch. I did a walk-on in The 400 Blows. It was during The 400 Blows that he told me about Jules and Jim and gave me the book. Madeleine Morgenstern sent me the copy Fran?ois had used while working on the script. - You'll sleep here and I'll sleep there. - That's right. Got any cigarettes? - Of course. You didn't follow the work on the script? No, that was a time in my life when I placed myself passively in the hands... I just love the steam locomotive scene. It still impresses people today. The sun'll be up in ten minutes. But everything to do with it... It was a really joyous time. If I stayed tomorrow, we'd be as good as married. Isn't that against our rules? - What logic! Meeting Fran?ois... the special atmosphere that prevailed... In any case, special for me, someone who was interested in film and who was only too glad, after 10 years in films, to break out of the routine and the hierarchy, which has come back, of course. The celebrities, the stars, the pyramid. There's something special in the tone, even the image. I'd rather watch than talk for a moment. Nothing is played out through dialogue. There's a kind of... simplicity. What I'm saying isn't intellectual, but there's a distancing in their manner. They are what they are. They're not acting the lines. You see what I mean? And the fluidity of Coutard's camera movements... it all goes together. It's really filmed like a song, a well-crafted song. Let her go, Jules. Lose one, find ten more. The theme is harmony. Yes, harmony. It's a musical film. Even when we were in preproduction. The gaiety in choosing costumes, scouting the locations we'd be shooting in, the hairdos. There was no elaborate idea of reconstructing a period. We didn't cram our heads full of details. There was no great anxiety over that. We seemed to be skirting things, but we were going right to the essential. You see? The film is in that gesture. You see? It was inspired by a drawing, by what Picasso did. This film fed on everything. Albert? This is Jim, a French friend. There's Serge. Danielle. Serge Rezvani and his wife. Yes, Rezvani and his wife. See that youth? It's not an adolescent youth. It's a youth that's adult, deep, and yet carefree. This one's more exotic. She looks like an Incan statue. What happened to Roch?'s diaries, the ones Fran?ois had? I brought you this. You know this book? Roch?'s notebooks. With a preface by Fran?ois. You can have this one. It's a superb text. You know... lots and lots of secretaries typed these and got depressed because they found it very macho. And too blunt, perhaps. His relations with women. Love, women, and sexuality. But those secretaries might have had problems in their love lives, so that aggravated things, because Roch?'s levity could seem like cynicism. In The Man Who Loved Women, there's a secretary who refuses to type the protagonist's text. They both had the same light suit made. It's superb how you first appear as a statue. They walked rapidly around it in silence. They didn't speak of it till the next day. Had they ever met such a smile? Never. What if they ever did? They'd follow it. See how the stock shots are used? Just incredible. Truffaut didn't trouble himself with complicated reconstructions. But it's not a problem. - No, it's not. That explains the film's lasting quality. What's magnificent... is that young people everywhere still see it. It's being watched right now. I haven't seen it myself... in years and years. And the format is magnificent too. - The wide-screen black and white. - Magnificent. "Jacques and Julien were inseparable. Julien's last novel had been a success. And all the young people... Two days ago, I was at Ladur?e's to buy macaroons, like Marguerite Duras, who loved them, and all of a sudden, three young people rushed up and began kissing me. They were Argentines who had just arrived and had been to a screening of Jules and Jim. And the emotions they felt... were joyous, even though the ending is tragic. And what happens in the film is both lighthearted and somber. It's a film that has traveled well. It's the Truffaut film that has traveled best. Both in terms of time and space. Her face bore the nobility of a province she personified as a child in a religious celebration. It started like a dream. As the organizer of this gathering, I propose we abolish forever monsieur, madame, and mademoiselle by drinking my favorite Nussberger wine in brotherhood. Instead of linking arms in the usual way, the feet of all those partaking will touch under the table. And thus they did. In high spirits, Jules moved his feet away. Jim's feet stayed a moment near Catherine's, who gently moved hers away first. A shy, happy smile played on Jules' lips and told the others he held them in his heart. Truffaut says you played a pivotal role in getting the film made. Of course. So much so that... I'd earned some money, and the film had run out of money... so I bailed out the production. Also, at that time I owned a secondhand Rolls-Royce. Friends had suggested I buy it. My son had had a serious accident during the filming of Moderato Cantabile, in a small Dauphine Gordini. People said I needed a big car for a child. I bought this massive car at a garage. It came in handy. We fitted it out with... what do you call it?... a roof rack, and we transported set elements. I really enjoyed helping out on certain sets, settings where I lived. In fact, I've always had a penchant for selecting objects... And costumes. - Sure, but... - More than that. Yes. The things we hung on the walls, not to reflect me, but my character's personality. This is the disguise scene. Naturally it brings to mind Sylvia Scarlett and other films, where women dress up as men. And everyone's handsome. There's that shared dandyism, insouciance more than impertinence. Yes. But insouciance is impertinent. Thank you, sir. Catherine was proud of her successful disguise. The men were moved, as if by a symbol they didn't understand. - Either it's raining or I'm dreaming. - Or both. If it's raining, let's go to the seashore. We leave tomorrow. This track looks excellent. I propose a race. There was never any sense of ponderousness. There can be a huge difference between the film you imagine when you start making it and the film you end up making. Suddenly the production drags down the lightness. And there's the low budget too. Even at our most numerous, actors included, there were only 21 or 22 of us, 22 the day we had the sound man. So that created a certain lightness in moving about. It's a New Wave film in that sense. Yes, but it also resembles the economics of certain great American films in black and white that some directors shot in two weeks or 17 days. I don't remember... there being any multiple takes, for instance. There was a real rapidity to the shooting, because everyone knew... We were all making the same film. That's not so usual. I'm almost ready. I just have to put on my dress. Never put a hat on a bed. - Are we taking the bike? This is a nice scene. Packing the suitcase. The bag too? What are you doing? - Burning these lies. Give me a match. It's very mysterious. My God! Don't move. You know that the entire film was dubbed. It's incredible. I just loved that period. We did that in the old studios on the Rue Forest just behind the old Gaumont Palace. It's a little-known fact that Truffaut's first films were entirely dubbed. The 400 Blows, Shoot the Piano Player. It made me fond of dubbing. Often, when a film's finished, the actors balk. "But I'll never find the tone I had!" But sometimes you go even further. Can you help me? So in fact truth in acting has little to do with creating. Acting isn't lying. We're taking that too. What is it? Sulfuric acid, for the eyes of men who tell lies. That bottle will break and burn all your things. Besides, you can buy that anywhere. - Really? - Yes. But it wouldn't be the same bottle. I swore I'd only use this bottle. There's a shift from euphoria to something harsher. Because inner realities loom up from time to time without warning. And the music is just right. The musical shading is nice. Your hat. They searched up and down the coast before finding the house of their dreams. Where was this? It was a house in the hinterlands of the Var. It allowed us to discover... Me, at least. Later, I bought a house at La Garde-Freinet. But this was closer to Sainte-Maxime. Not above La Garde-Freinet. Hurry up. We're going to the beach. Come on, Jim. We're off in search of the last signs of civilization. A piece of tire. - Look. - A bottle. It's as much about a three-way romance as friendship. - I was about to say that. - Really? I was about to say that. Look at the simplicity of their relationship. That explains why nowadays young viewers only retain an image of happiness. Who hasn't dreamt of not having to make choices? It's true... you can love two people at the same time, for reasons that are different, or similar, or complementary, or parallel. One may be the mirror image of the other, his reflection. It's like an ideal image of romantic life, minus the cruelty brought about by the desire to possess, which leads to jealousy. - The other's not a rival. - There's no rivalry. What matters is that joie de vivre. And there's no ambiguity. Nowadays people would see homosexual connotations between the men. They'd imagine sensual perversion in a three-way romance. But it's two couples. When the film came out, did people sneer, or were they shocked by this three-way harmony? I don't have any recollection of that. I must have the ability to block out any unpleasant memories. Because it was so enchanting. The shoot was exhausting, like all shoots. You had to get up early. You had to be really receptive, yet at the same time concentrated. And since it was a small group, we were closer. And I had such affection, such respect, even admiration, for Fran?ois that I couldn't help but be aware of what was on his mind. This scene was shot near St. Tropez. This scene was shot near St. Tropez. I'm sure it's all been developed since. Truffaut, in his preface to Roch?'s notebooks, tips his hat to you, saying he often had doubts, and that you were there to give things a boost, give the film a boost. Almost like the character herself. Because of what I just said... this absolute faith in Fran?ois' cinematic genius. We were perfectly in sync. Perfectly. And I knew we were making something special and unique. But it wasn't like, "Oh, boy! We're gonna have a runaway hit!" There was a real joie de vivre. Nor a masterpiece. No. It was nice, very harmonious. Truffaut was afraid of betraying Roch?, who had died two years earlier. He had a high opinion of Roch?. And since I didn't share this elevated opinion... I'd read the novel, but for me the novel belonged to Fran?ois, and the idea was his. What I wanted was... It's vital that everyone be making the same film. That doesn't always happen. That doesn't mean that the technicians, who are sometimes wrongfully called "the hired help"... Sometimes you can round up the best talent, but without the same sense of purpose. Whereas here there was an unspoken intimacy. I thought it said "who arts in heaven." I imagined my father with an easel painting outside the pearly gates. I believe I just said something funny. In any case, amusing. You might at least smile. Will anyone present scratch my back? Heaven scratches those who scratch themselves. What? See that slap? It's nothing, but... It's nothing, it's not mean, but... Some freeze frames, barely perceptible, but they're not just gratuitous. When you look at someone, sometimes you do a freeze-frame. Expressions you save. And about that slap? - It looks harmless... - But it's a small rupture. Which has echoes later. It's a small gesture of cruelty between Catherine and Jules. I miss Paris. Let's go back, please. I wonder what happened to that house. Here's a side of Roch? coming out. The art collector. This is for Catherine. This is for you two. Nice Picasso. - What is this? - A little hand to scratch your back. Very practical. You see? That slap left its mark. That's what this film means for me, who experienced it intimately. But films don't always leave this impression. It's a moment fixed in time. It's a period of life fixed in time. But you can feel life's intensity. Lots of films come and go... films you watch with pleasure, and yet... It's very moving. All the same, I like that girl. She wants to be free. She invents her own life every moment. Jim doesn't look pleased. Frankly, no. It's a confused and self-indulgent play. Another writer who revels in vice to preach virtue. Ah, the scene on the embankment. I had a stand-in waiting to jump into the Seine in my place. She was so nervous that she asked for rum to work up her nerve. There was none left for afterward. When it was time to jump, she was so drunk that I did the leap myself. There were some guys... Wait, we'll come to it. The most important factor in any relationship is the woman's fidelity. The husband's is secondary. Who was it who wrote, "Woman is natural, therefore abominable?" Baudelaire, but he was describing a certain world. Not at all. He spoke of women in general. What he says about a young girl is magnificent: "Horror, monster, assassin of the arts, little fool, little slut. Amazing macho tirade! Wait. I'm not finished. This is marvelous: "I'm always astonished they allow women inside churches. What could they possibly have to say to God?" - You're both fools. - I didn't say anything. And I don't necessarily agree with what Jules says at 2:00 in the morning. - Then protest. - I am protesting. So that's you. And the hat had to float. There were some guys yelling, "Go on, jump!" Because I hesitated. He imagined himself swimming with her and holding his breath to frighten Jules. Catherine, why? I was in bed for two days due to the dirty water. But we did it in one take. There were several cameras? Yes, two. Jules was pale, silent, less self-assured, and more handsome than ever. Catherine wore her same smile, like a modest young general after his first brilliant campaign. The voice-over works well. Is that Michel Subor's voice? Fran?ois could have done it himself. I think it's better this way. It increased the distancing effect. That was the challenge: to make it from an old man's viewpoint. Roch? was over 70 when he wrote it. Truffaut was concerned about maintaining that distance when he wasn't even yet 30. - You're joking. - I never joke. I have no sense of humor, I assure you. Jean-Louis Richard. I know people who do. My wife's friends, coworkers. But personally I have no sense of humor. With his usual optimism, Jim had arrived late. He was upset with himself, afraid he had missed her. He thought, "A girl like that might well have left at 7:01. A woman like that could have rushed across the room, never noticing me behind my newspaper, and left." He kept repeating to himself, "A woman like that." But just what was she like? For the first time, he began to really think about Catherine. I hear Catherine's son... the real Catherine... is quite a character. Lots of people have told me about him. He was in the diplomatic service. I think he lives in Paris. I was always a bit fearful about meeting him. But I hear he's very charming and has quite an original personality. He's Jules's son, so to speak. Not Jim's. Jim? Did I wake you? Catherine and I are going to my country to get married. Bravo, Jules! Please tell her I'm sorry I was late. I waited until ten before 8:00. She's more optimistic than you where time's concerned. She was at the hairdresser's and arrived at 8:00 to dine with you. You see, the crossed wires. Hello, Jim? I'm very happy. Jules is going to teach me French boxing. With an Austrian accent. Me? I've lost my accent. My pronunciation is perfect. Let me show you. Isn't the cinema magnificent! This fixing of time... nullifies everything, even death. War broke out a few days later. War broke out a few days later. Jules and Jim were called up by their respective armies and lost touch for a long time. I suppose that in the novel the Great War takes more space. It feels like Truffaut wants it to be a hiatus. The images are superb. The archival footage is superb. It's not the choice... His focus isn't history here. How could you include the Great War? It would be a four-hour film. What matters is the story. The two friends. The images encapsulate the Great War. It depicts very well the hideousness. The difference between war and peace. And that war was like no other. The war dragged on and on, and men settled into it. Gradually a normal life emerged, marked by the different seasons, with its down time, routines, pauses, and even distractions. Even though we're now used to this from all the TV programs, some of which are quite good... we're used to seeing stock shots of the past. But here they're part of a film, part of a story where we expect to find the characters. It's just right. It's juxtaposed with the fictional element. But I wonder how far... It's like I was saying: Fiction is as valid as reality, only better. It's the dream life of movie people, not angels. The love of letter writing, too. You know, when you're caught up... When your life's caught up in the workings of filmmaking, theater, music... and the film reminds me of this... you live a double, triple... quadruple life, different from other people. That's why I don't like separating the notion of life and work when talking about a career. That notion... seems dated and a bit alien to me. You're consumed. Look at that. It makes you think of Apollinaire. His poems from the front. See how it nourishes us? It makes you think of poetry and painting. We saw the statue. And the mass graves, too. Of course. It doesn't help us escape reality. It helps us understand every aspect of it. And your sensitivity grows with the passing of time. Look. It's magnificent. Jules' country had lost the war. Jim's had won. Hugo wrote some superb things on the War of 1870. In the Chamber of Deputies, he spoke about there being neither victory nor defeat. Jim wrote Jules, "Should I marry and have children too?" Jules replied, "Come and judge for yourself." Catherine added a few words of invitation. Jim left. It was such an important event that he took his time. Superb, the arrival in the Vosges. It was the most dramatic phase of the shoot. There was a sort of weariness. Fran?ois was probably going through... a moment of doubt. We used the Rolls-Royce a lot there. We went looking for pieces to decorate the chalet we lived in. I brought in Florence Malraux, who'd been working at L'Express. One night, Malraux called to say Florence's half brothers had been killed. Little Sabine Haudepin. She's so cute. We had a helicopter that day. It was in an accident later. So the mood was... - So Florence left. But she came back. We took her in my car to find a chaplain whom Malraux knew well from Resistance days. He came along in the car as well for the funeral services. We were in a hotel where De Gaulle once slept. I heard Florence typing. I only broke the news to her the next morning. - She was the script girl? - Yes. The film's tone changes here. You hear it in the music. - You haven't changed, Jim. - Nor have you, Jules. So no one has changed. All of a sudden, there was... Jules was anxious, and Jim was too. It infected me. So we stopped. That's the flexibility of a low-budget film. We stopped. We didn't shoot for two days. Time enough to recoup. That melancholy is in the film. It's part of it. That light quality. That's why I pointed out the slap, the little shadings. Time's going by. Sabine's presence means years have passed. - She was born during the war. - Of course. An angel is passing by. Of course. It's 1:20. So? Angels always pass by at 20 past the hour. - Really? - So I've heard. I didn't know that. - Neither did I. - It's true. Everyone knows the angel of silence passes... And at 20 before the hour as well. I believe it. So you won the war, you louse! I'd rather have won all this. You must be hungry. Let's eat. You can detect what's unspoken in their looks. The crossed wires. Jim there, Jules here, and Sabine next to me. I did the cooking for a while. The house looks large, but it was really tiny. I have to think about them all week, write them Friday night, and send them off via airmail. And you? I received a commission for a book on dragonflies. And Oskar Werner? I think he's superb. Superb. He was in an Ophuls film. Lola Mont?s? That's where Fran?ois saw him. In the garden. Surprisingly, they had a falling-out later on. No, it's not so surprising. You know, there are many sides to a person. Oskar wasn't at ease with himself. When you take to drink... it's not easy. It's a sickness of the soul, in a way. Perhaps there was a sense of mutual disappointment. There was an underlying tension. When I talk about harmony and happiness, it wasn't something corny or rosy. It was something very alive, very keen. Maybe it was because everything had gone so well that... It's like when you enjoy a place and say, "I'll come back again." But I never go back. Never. In this case the context had changed. It was another film, another story. - And in another language. - Fahrenheit 451. Don't forget that Fran?ois spoke no English then. They disappointed each other. And Werner wasn't his first choice for Fahrenheit. - I forget who he wanted. - Terence Stamp. That would've gone better. There might've been the usual actor-director conflicts, but without the prior experience coloring things. But he's fine here. He's wonderful. But that means nothing. You can be miserable while making a film... yet still give a lovely performance. What's amazing is that this triangle is not about fusing into one. Each is an individual. Each is a pole apart. No one is lost in the other. That's what gives this relationship its strength. They're individuals, three individuals. Love is usually depicted... and it's an amazing lie... as a desire to merge. - To disappear. - Into the other. So when it's not pure love... it's engulfed by sensuality. "The flesh is sad, alas, and I've read all the books!" That's true freedom. Jules and Jim resumed their long-interrupted conversation. They talked about the war. Jules avoided talking about his family. Catherine was both kind and stern with Jules, but Jim sensed something wasn't going well. A moment of grace, then suddenly, a shadow. Exactly, shadows. To bed, sleepyhead. The bedbugs are hungry. Once upon a time... there was a nice little bedbug. Good night, Sabine. Good night, Jim. See you in the morning. You can see it's love. Love, if not desire, is casting the shadow. Marriage and motherhood suit her. She's less the grasshopper now and more the ant. Don't be deceived. True, she brings order and harmony to this house. But if things go too smoothly, discontent sets in. She lashes out at everything with her gestures and expressions. I've always thought as much. A little Napoleon. She claims the world is rich and that one can cheat a little now and then. See? She begs God in advance for forgiveness, certain she'll obtain it. I'm afraid she may leave us. It's very unusual for the character of a woman... to be... described like that. She's no longer altogether my wife, Jim. She's had lovers... three that I know of. One on the eve of our wedding... It's rebellion. That's what's so particular. I'm not the man she needs, and she's not the kind of woman to put up with that. There's still a misunderstanding, since the man says, "I'm not the man she needs." There's still the notion, now that they're married, that one man is enough for one woman, and vice versa. Catherine's encouraged him and given him hope. It's beautiful that a man can have that sort of clarity, saying he isn't enough for her. I can't remember a single film that says anything like that. With such finesse. Yes, and with real feeling. Not with resentment, but with feeling. Accepting it as a given. Look at the lovely lighting. Isn't black and white beautiful? Listen to that mole cricket's song. It's a kind of mole. I love these framing effects. So Catherine, the radiant queen of the house, was ready to fly off. Jim wasn't surprised. Why is it, now that we have so many technical means, that we don't use irises? It's as if people are afraid to do what's already been done. I recently saw one used in a film by Arnaud Desplechin, Esther Kahn, who's somewhat inspired by Truffaut. He uses devices from silent film, He uses devices from silent film, from the early days of cinema. Diaphragm effects. The glasses. I still have that sweater. A lot of the clothes... were mine. Keep in mind that words can't have the same meaning across languages, because they're not of the same gender. Unlike in French, "war," "death," and "moon" are masculine in German, while "sun" and "love" are feminine. You can sense it's not a large space. Yes, just large enough. Believe me, it was smaller than it looks. In France too, skirts became shorter the longer the war went on. It caused many a shouting match for married soldiers on leave. Men felt they were played for fools. But the reason was that fabric was scarce. Yes, just as women cut their hair short for safety around factory machinery. Fran?ois always had this need to introduce information. - Not at all. - What? France has the greatest variety of wines in Europe. In the world! Look at the Bordeaux: Ch?teau Lafite, Ch?teau Margaux, Ch?teau d'Yquem... I studied up on all this. And even better ones too, like... wait a minute. Clos-Vougeot, and the Burgundies: Romane, Chambertin... And the Beaujolais: Pouilly-Fuiss?, Pouilly-Loch?, Moulin-?-Vent... All eyes were fixed on the mortar shell as it rolled down the steps. Three steps, two steps... Hit the ground! Catch me. The grays and blacks... Yes. There's arrogance, yet it's not unbearable. Just enough. This may be the Truffaut film where nature is most... Where he accepts it most. He's not a nature lover. No, but in Two English Girls... And he loves... Nature has to be there for the rapport among the three to be... Yes, it went with the characters. - All right, but tell you what? - Doesn't matter. Just talk away. Jim began, "There were once two young men..." whom he didn't name. He told of their friendship in Paris before meeting a certain girl, the impact she had on them, and all that ensued. Even the line, "Not this one, Jim." There he couldn't avoid saying his own name. He described the trio's outings, their trip to the seashore. Catherine saw that Jim remembered everything about her very clearly. She argued a few points on principle and added other details. He described the missed rendezvous in the caf?, and the three of them seen through his eyes. He spoke of Jules' hidden qualities and how he'd sensed that Jules could never keep Catherine. - You'd have told me all that in the caf?? - Yes. Go on. There's nothing more to say. There was the war, my joy at finding Jules again, you coming to the station, the happy days I've spent with you here, what I've seen, what I've learned, what I've suspected, this cloud on the horizon... I mean Albert. - Are you for Jules and against me? - No more than he is himself. I'll tell the whole story now the way I've experienced it. It was Jules' generosity, innocence, and vulnerability that dazzled me and won me over. He was such a contrast to other men. By bringing him happiness, I hoped to cure him of his insecurities, but I realized they were part of him. They're moving away from paradise. I mean, it's paradise lost. There's also her hatred of lying. It's wrong to lie. It's nice to watch a film and not think about style and form. Of course one's sensitive to it, but I think... it's nice when a film provokes... the simple desire to talk about life, our experiences here and now... in the 21 st century. He wrote me ardent love letters, wonderful letters. From afar my love for him grew. I gave him a new halo. The real break between us occurred during his first leave. I felt as if I was in a stranger's arms. Truffaut liked the idea of correspondence. People built strong connections via letters. It's a sort of tie. - Yes, it's a tie. - A very strong one. He'd be disappointed to see how little people write now. The fax makes you write, but it's different now. But it's nice anyway. He didn't like the phone either. I don't like to talk a lot on the phone. Cell phones are handy. I can't believe people spend hours on them. Portable, dispensable... it's all about speed. Don't feel sorry for him. The distractions I provide are still enough for him. Then there's Albert. He told me of that statue you three loved that I apparently resemble. I flirted with him. The black and white is beautiful. And see how the dialogue... Because there's lots of dialogue... and the way it's filmed... It's splendid. - Incredible. Because that happens. When you can talk all night... It's almost dawn. It's part of the seduction process. When you want to tell the other everything. A whole night's gone by. Perhaps she was seducing him, though Jim was far from sure. It was impossible to tell. Catherine revealed her goals only when she'd achieved them. That's a fine line: "Catherine revealed her goals only when she'd achieved them." - This was the sound man's day. - What do you mean? We had no sound engineer during the shoot. When I saw Rezvani arrive with his guitar, I thought... - That meant... It meant we'd be recording the song. It was the only day we had a sound engineer. - So you sacrificed your mustache too? - Like everyone else. But I don't like it. I feel naked. I'm going to grow it back. Albert was wounded in the war. In the trenches. I'm all right now, but when I woke up and saw the doctors probing inside my skull, I thought of Oscar Wilde. "O Lord, spare me the physical pain. I can cope with the spiritual pain." What's appalling about war is that it deprives man of his own individual battle. Yes, but I think he can wage his battle outside the field of war. I'm thinking of a gunner I met in the hospital. Returning from leave, he met a girl on a train. They talked from Nice to Marseilles. Stepping down onto the platform, she gave him her address. He wrote her frantically from the trenches every day for two years on bits of wrapping paper, by candlelight. As bombs rained down, his letters became ever more intimate. At first it was "Dear Miss" and "Yours truly." By the third letter he called her "My little lamb" and asked for her picture. Then it was "My adorable lamb." Then "I kiss your hand." Then "I kiss your forehead." Later he described the picture she'd sent and wrote of her breasts, which he thought he glimpsed under her robe. Soon he was addressing her intimately. "I love you terribly." One day he wrote to her mother, asking for the daughter's hand. He became her fianc? without ever seeing her again. I wonder if that isn't a reference to Apollinaire. Yes, it is Apollinaire. When she replied rather coldly, he was enraged and begged her not to flirt with him, for he could die at any time, and he was right. You see, Jules, to understand this extraordinary seduction by mail, you have to have known the violence of trench warfare, that collective madness where death is present every moment. So here's a man who took part in the Great War yet managed to wage his own individual battle at the same time and win a woman's heart through long-distance persuasion. Like you, he had a head wound when he arrived at the hospital, but he wasn't as lucky as you. That's so typical of Truffaut's films. The idea of a wild passion... "Your breasts are the only bombs I love." I'll show you some pictures of him. Flip through them quickly and he seems to be moving. Beautiful story, Jim. Jules wrote me beautiful letters from the war too. Hello, Albert. Did you finish my song? Come up and let's work on it. The rocking of this chair calls us to the pleasures of the flesh. - What about the song? - We've just about got it. We do, don't we? Shall we? It's too good for them, but one can't choose one's audience. The song wasn't planned. It wasn't planned in the film? Serge was very close to my son's father, Jean-Louis Richard. We'd known each other since we were young. There were songs that cropped up like that, without being professional, inspired by things that happened to us, by stories we'd tell, sometimes by a newspaper item. I sang a lot with Fran?ois. This song came back often. The song had been written when Jean-Louis Richard and I broke up. It was the whirlwind of life. Even apart, we'd always meet again. And then, gradually, it became an integral part of the film. When I'm acting, I'm happy, so I sing. So there was this song, there was "Angora Rose," and songs like that. Had you ever sung professionally? Or just for friends? I'd sung as an actress at the Com?die Fran?aise in interludes, Moli?re plays... in The Marriage of Figaro. That's a director's inspiration, to suddenly pick up on something in the air, and it fits in so nicely. Sometimes you get ideas, but later you cut them. You don't hear it like a song. It has a dramatic effect on the foursome's relationship. - Were there several takes? - I don't remember. No, just one... since I made a mistake but Fran?ois kept it in. Catherine meant different things to each and couldn't please them all, but too bad. Jim could only admire Catherine unreservedly on her own. In the company of others, she changed in his eyes. The movement flows. The film wasn't in opposition to the written word but in celebration of it. And it did wonders for an unknown novel. You were very much in love, Jim. I can feel that. Why didn't you marry her? - It just didn't happen. - What's she like? - Sensible and patient. She says she'll wait for me forever. Her name is Gilberte. Do you still love her, and she you? Don't cause suffering, Jim. I need adventure and risk. That was a blue scarf... the one I was wearing. Blue. I remember it. The color. You mustn't forget him. You must warn him. Translation, Catherine? "Hearts yearning for each other O God, O God, the pain they cause" Not bad. Though "O God, O God" was your addition. Good night. Give my regards to the others if you see them. Would you lend me Goethe's Elective Affinities tonight? - That's Goethe. - Of course. The quote. I'll bring it tomorrow. Do you think that's the idea, the contradiction in both life and the film, between time that is... It's painful, because things can't last. A moment can be intense, but it can't last. And love is caught between the two. There's a moment when... I get the feeling that... Jules senses that. I think Catherine is full... of desire and curiosity. - Is that answer good enough? - Of course. Because it's cruel. Living free is cruel. It demands more... that you be more available. But it's cruel to others. Hence the quote. Same thing here. Truffaut didn't like love scenes. No, and he was right. So he used shadows. He was right. Delerue's music helps a lot. And the gestures, pushing her hair back. What bothered Fran?ois most was Henri Serre's height. - He was tall. - He sure was. He always had trouble with tall people. Except women. But very tall men... He couldn't imagine Jim lying in a bed. That's terrific. A sex scene would be unbearable in this sort of film. You'd made a film with Louis Malle earlier. It made a lot of noise. Yes, The Lovers. But that was... It came at the end of a very prudish period. It was all suggested. Maybe that made it more striking. I've asked Jim to move into the house. He'll take the small room. Be careful, Jim... for her sake and your own. In romance there's always something hovering. It comes up in Mississippi Mermaid, in The Last Metro. Vultures hovering over love. There's always a threat. It's dangerous. Enriching yet destructive. You have to experience it. You have to see it to believe it. From here on it's a mess, but there's nothing to be done about that. What's on the other side? What's wonderful too is that your character isn't an activist. She lives only for herself, not for other women. She's independent. But that's the best way to live for other women. To be a role model. The moment a woman needs to take refuge in a group, it can only be a rejection of independence. Activism is a way of escaping personal responsibility. The 'we" takes priority over the "I." That doesn't get anyone anywhere. Maybe on occasion, but... That's a nice image. Many Americans told me the film did a lot for them. - Really? - For women. Coming from France... And for men. Many young men still talk to me about it. So some of them see things differently. I think US filmmakers were able to deal more freely with emotions. The village was the table. They took turns as the idiot. Sabine especially set them roaring with laughter. It's incredible. Just when things verge on disappointment, drama, bitterness, everyday life takes over with its share... of little moments, and passion is lived on a parallel track. You mustn't be a burden to others. Catherine had said, "One only truly loves for a moment," but for her, that moment came back again and again. Life was one long holiday. Jules and Jim had never handled such large dominoes. Time passed. Happiness isn't easy to tell of and wears out without anyone noticing. One Sunday, Catherine decided to seduce Jules. While Jim read downstairs, she took Jules into her room. That's good. The rape is amazing. Of a man! Yet it's a game. Though Jim told himself he had no right to be jealous, he was anyway. Catherine noticed this and never repeated the experiment. One day, the four walked around a lake hidden in the mist of a lush, humid valley. He really was a romantic. Catherine had a brief headache. Jim had worse, from fatigue. He thought, "if we had children, they'd be tall and thin and have headaches too." On the shore of the lake they played with pebbles. She made them throw them endlessly. She and Jules learned to make them skip. A far cry from the Riviera. It's pure romanticism. The mist, the lake. Yet something dark hovers over them. Another helicopter shot? - It was all shot the same day. - Very beautiful. See how the wind from the rotors is stirring up the bushes? It suddenly adds drama to the action, thanks to the rotors. That's a real departure. Not just for the train. And the fact the train goes from right to left... Writing goes left to right. We arrive from left to right and leave from right to left. And the fact the train moves down the screen turns it into a fall or a breaking-off. Henri Serre at times seems very French as an actor, almost traditionally French. But he has an Anglo-Saxon side, a refined side. He reminds me of Paul-Jean Toulet, whom I admire immensely. I love his poetry. He looked like him. He traveled a lot. One of those dilettantes... Dandies, people who lived on curiosity. You could picture him in a London club. Roch? was like that, they say. A biography of Roch? came out recently. I'll send it to you. - I'll read it. Marcel Duchamp was his best friend. - Is Jules in Paris? - No, he didn't come. Too bad. ...I head home to break up my cousin's marriage and marry him. - Hello, Jim. How's your buddy? - Just fine. - Still with the same girl? - Yes. Must be doing well. ...a respectable man. I pursued him, but he wasn't interested. The husband I abandoned finally divorced me. The undertaker finally marries me, convinced at last. It's a perfect marriage, but no children. The only man I could never cheat on... he leaves me no time or energy. Those people were no dummies. - Their attitude to art... - All of them. Even the supporting characters. Good-bye, Th?r?se. - Hello there. - Hello, Jim. How's Jules? Just fine. That's more the atmosphere of 1920s Montparnasse. She never talks. She's not an idiot. Just empty. Nothing in there. She's just a thing. - A pretty thing. - Yes, a beautiful object. It's just sex. Unadulterated sex. Say good-bye to the gentleman. - Good-bye. The painters, the artists of the 1920s. Catherine spent the winter at home before the fireplace. She was Jim's fianc?e, entrusted to Jules. She asked Jules every day, "Do you think Jim loves me?" Listen, Gilberte. If Catherine decides she wants something and thinks no one will be hurt... though she could be wrong, of course... she does it for her own pleasure and to learn from the experience. She hopes this way to attain wisdom one day. The other side is fidelity. Being faithful, but what... You can see for yourself. There's an attempt to overthrow something established. It's sad. There's something heartrending about it. This desire for coupling... I don't mean only in the sexual sense. Being a couple... brings with it pain... and imprisonment. It's a choice that involves a loss. I find it unbearable. I don't know why, but I do. It must be overcome, but how? He goes back, and he's welcomed by... Exactly. Why didn't Catherine come to meet me? She wasn't happy with your letters. You wrote too much about your work, your farewells. The way it's told is wonderful. Even when absent, she's present all the more. - But she's waiting for us? - Yes, I think so. Of course. It was wonderful, having the chance... to make films like that in a period like that. Really? In the early '60s. I don't think... many young actresses nowadays are given such a wonderful gift. It's more than the pleasure of acting. It's a wonderful personal enrichment. When you've made films, one after the other, like Elevator to the Gallows, Jules and Jim, The Lovers, it's just incredible. To draw close... to characters, inspirations... Because being an actress in that sort of context, or the ones I mentioned before, is to be in tune with the fantasies of a man. What woman hasn't dreamt of that? And being in all these different settings... Catherine can't achieve that, but an actress can. And you think it's because in the early 1960s young filmmakers had hope? Not only that. I think the mindset, society, the world have changed. What's no longer central in today's world... or is less talked about is feelings about love. We're about to see the advent of a third sex. But here, the only subject is heterosexuality. It's a period piece, sure, and homosexuality remained in the closet. But now it must be taken into account. As I said earlier: We can't imagine there being any sort of ambiguity between Jules and Jim. I'm not questioning directors' talent... we won't get into discussing that... but it was a major concern: how to live, how to love. Hello. What's the matter? You just arrived. There, now you're mine and I'm yours. All is well. But in your letters, you spoke so much of your affairs. Well, I have my own. You spoke of bidding farewell to your loves. I decided to bid farewell to mine too. It's important. It's still as important, but its importance is overlooked. It's a kind of neglect. There's been a change. And that's what's crazy, fabulous... scary, and thrilling all at once. The film, aside from its beauty... and integrity, awakens in us a sort of... I have enough distance to say: a sort of nostalgia for the way we saw life back then. That's why I think films are so important. Films made today... the best ones, and even the lesser ones, say something... about what's at the center of our concerns. THE PROMISED LAND ABRUPTLY RECEDED When they were ready for a child, Catherine didn't become pregnant. They saw a specialist, who told them to be patient, that these things took months with many couples. Loyalty is a very powerful theme. Loyalty, not lying, integrity. It affects everything, even money. There's no duplicity. Morals aren't discarded, they're reinvented, and they remain loyal to them. It's a nightmare when the evening comes. I think of the child we'll never have. I feel I'm taking some test. I can't stand it anymore. - Our love is all that counts. Those concerns are so strong that they block out curiosity about the outside world. If I find out too late I still love you, that's the risk I take. Go back to Gilberte, since she writes you every day. - You're unfair. - No doubt I am. But I'm heartless. That's why I don't love you, and why I'll never love anyone. Besides, I'm 32 and you're 29. When you're 40 and I'm 43, you'll want a girl of 25, and I'll be left all alone like a fool. Maybe you're right. I'll leave tomorrow. Let's separate for three months. Are you hurt? Then I'll stop being hurt. We mustn't ever both suffer at once. When you stop suffering, I'll start. Am I disturbing you? They're ferocious. It's like roulette. I can't take it anymore. It reminds me of Duras' work as well. Funny, no? I can't stand him any longer. I'm going mad. There's the dramatization of things that might seem... excessive. An excess of life. They want to live every moment fully. To go for absolutes... Yet it's not neurotic, not at all muddled. I can't help it if we couldn't have a child. They want everything to go well all at once: themselves, maternity, love, friendship. Growing old. - Want me to talk to him? - No, please don't. No one smokes in films anymore. Except grass. Too bad. We've decided to separate for three months. What do you think? He's wonderful. He's so moving. I know very well you despise me. I will never despise you. I'll always love you, whatever you do, whatever happens. This scene was practically all improvised. I love you too. We did just one take. We really were happy together, weren't we? We still are. At least I am. Really? Yes, we'll stay together always... like an old couple, with Sabine and our grandchildren. We missed the superb opening lines because we were talking. Which were? You said, "I love you." I said, "Wait." I was about to say, "Take me." You said, "Go away." Then you stay here. I'll sleep downstairs. My little Catherine. You often make me think of a Chinese play I saw before the war. In close-up. Never be afraid of faces. I was thinking the same thing. Faces. Only Bergman did that. But with more emphasis. I think Truffaut admired him. I took him to see his first Bergman films. There was a small cinema on Rue Caumartin that showed films... It showed Bergman films in subtitled prints. The first one we saw was Monika. Those were things I shared with Fran?ois. Henry James. You had him read James? That led to The Green Room. And champagne. Jim left the house the next morning. Catherine wanted to take him to the station once more. A mist had settled over the meadow during the night. The rest of the hive sensed confusedly that Jim had lost favor with its queen and thus naturally should leave. The house has already disappeared. The autumn railway schedule had just taken effect. There was no train until the next day. One always feels guilty in a hotel room. I may not be very moral, but I have no taste for secrecy. But you do. Don't deny it. I wouldn't believe you. Jim thought of the children they might have had. He imagined a houseful of handsome children. He also knew that if they had none, Catherine would take up her adventures again. They didn't speak, but they made love in that cold, sad hotel room, not knowing why... perhaps to bring their story to a close. It was like a burial, or as if they were already dead. It's crazy because this scene could've been... He avoids obscenity by having her do something very beautiful and ordinary that a woman does every day. It avoids banality. Or at least repetition. The next day she took him to his train, but they didn't wave good-bye. They parted on the verge of tears, though nothing forced them to. See? Right to left. He goes off. We're so used to our writing conventions that when he goes against it... Here's your inhaler. There was a letter too. I think I'm pregnant. Come. Catherine. Gilberte, please give me some writing paper. Catherine, I'm very ill, in no shape to get out of bed, and I've no desire to come see you, most likely pregnant by another, for our pitiful good-bye couldn't have succeeded where our greatest love failed. "...where our greatest love failed." You're right. I don't believe a word about this illness. I'll write him immediately and say you wish to see him. Dear Imaginary Invalid, come as soon as you can. Catherine awaits a letter. Write in large letters, for her eyes are tired. Suddenly it becomes a war. A war of letters. With the abandoned husband as accomplice. My doubts are well justified by our past, Albert, and all the rest. But it's not shocking. Because the character isn't shocked. - It's daring. - Since the husband's not shocked. Some critics, now that I think of it, were shocked by the audacity. There were some bad reviews. I think it was banned in some countries. Wasn't it banned... In Canada, probably. I love you, Jim. So many unbelievable things we can't understand turn out to be true. I'm finally going to have a child. He did this again in Two English Girls. I'm absolutely certain you're the father. The same intensity. Your love is now alive within me. You must believe me. This paper is your skin. This ink is my blood. I'm pressing hard so the ink enters in. Answer me quickly. Darling, I believe you, and I believe in you. I'm coming to you. I know whatever bit of good I find within me comes from you. They'd promised never to call each other, fearing to hear each other's voice when they couldn't touch. The mail took three days. Their letters crossed. "My doubts are well justified by our past, Albert, and all the rest." I'll think no more of you so that you'll stop thinking of me. You disgust me now, which is wrong... I hope I won't anger you, but it's as if all the drama around love is tougher for men to deal with than for women. They're rather fearful. Like the scene on the Seine, I might say. The image of a woman is always threatening, always scary. - Frightening. - More forthright. But a bit sorceress-like, frightening. I'd forgotten their desire for a child. It will come to play a role later, because there's something sterile about their relationship. It can't be. I can't believe it! You gave up your chalet for good? Yes, we prefer to live in France now. We've rented an old mill on the Seine. The Moulin d'And?. Please tell me about Catherine. They also play dominoes in Two English Girls. It's a period game. One that takes some thought. It seems childish and simple. - And peaceful. It's not just because it's a game from that time. It's the pieces, and the sounds they make. They're nice to look at. Picasso again. Does Catherine know you've come to see me? Yes. She invites you for a ride in her car. I hope you'll accept, and perhaps your wife... She won't accept, but I will. I must be going. No, Jules! You can't wear a hat like that, at least not in France. Take mine. - Very well. That's the Moulin d'And?? Truffaut often filmed there. Some of The Soft Skin. A lovely spot. She's in very good spirits this morning. Please don't upset her. - Me? It's wonderful here. That's Catherine's car. Come. Jim's here. Catherine was smiling, but she had a look of intrigue about her. She wrapped her white pajamas in a parcel just so. Jim wondered why but then forgot about it, and they left for a drive. I'm so hungry. Shall we eat here? - Time's passed. - You can feel it. There's a more serious tone. More sadness. More hats. Glasses. - You have a date in town perhaps? - Perhaps. The pajamas. Serge. The festive atmosphere is gone. It's more organized, more planned. This premeditated adultery... without enthusiasm. Give me my little package. Good night. Well-played second act, including the bit with the white pajamas. I wasn't expecting it. I'm surprised she didn't give that role to a new leading man. It's so childish. But why? He was perfect for tonight. Leave her the car. Catherine's maxim is: At least one party in a relationship must be faithful. The other party. There's always a little moral, a way of summing things up. In today's scripts, no one would dare comment after the fact on an event that has occurred, to define it. But here there are statements defining how one should live. But that's something Fran?ois perhaps remembered... from an interview with Howard Hawks, who said that everything should be said three times in a film so that it strikes the viewer. Right. Once doesn't work. Twice isn't quite enough. What an awful night. I don't know what I was doing there. That kind of life was dead for me. It was a desert to die in. You mentioned Duras. What reminds you of her? Her writings? The characters. I often teased her, saying she had a gift for tragedy... and melodrama, which made her laugh. But her main concern was love between men and women. She had the taste and disposition for it. She couldn't imagine meeting someone without there being some sort of resonance, some potential for a hint of passion. That's how you explore the universe. I feel that keen curiosity too. Perhaps everyone does. I control it for your sake, but I'm not sure you do for mine. I agree with you that in love a couple is not ideal. You only have to look around. You wanted to invent something better by rejecting hypocrisy and resignation. You wanted to invent love. But pioneers must be humble and unselfish. We must face the truth. We failed. We made a mess of everything. You tried to change me to suit you. I tried to spread joy, but I've created only pain. My promise to Gilberte that we'd grow old together means nothing because I can put it off forever. It's like a counterfeit bill. I no longer hope to marry you. You must know: I'm going to marry Gilberte. She and I can still have children. That's a beautiful story. But what about me? Here she looks most like the statue. What about the children I wanted? You didn't want them. Yes, I did. They would have been beautiful. I wonder if cinema wasn't invented to manufacture regrets. There you sense they'll... This is the only time I'm not as fond of the music. It doesn't go with the spirit of the film. No, because it illustrates this sequence. Catherine betrays her character a bit here. Catherine betrays Catherine. What Jim told her is a bit disappointing. He resigns himself to marriage. The revolver... I'd forgotten about that. SEVERAL MONTHS LATER Here it's much later. The auto-da-f?, the books. Terrible images. It's the Studio des Ursulines just as it is now, with those columns. Inventing love and the couple... it's the basis of Truffaut's cinema. A couple is... not the best solution. And yet it's the one we must try to accept. "Can't live with you or without you." I read a magazine that spoke of Truffaut's levity, but Truffaut wasn't that way. He's always been misunderstood. Something's always hovering. He deals with serious matters, but with a light touch. His touch is deft, but not superficial. - Now they're burning books. - It's unbelievable. See how handsome they look. That's a great shot, with the three glasses. For Catherine, you were easy to get and hard to keep. Your love waned and soared with hers. I never knew those ups and downs. Mr. Jim... I have something to tell you. Would you come with me? Jules, watch us carefully. - It's Catherine who decides. - Frightening. She always decides. This ending is frightening. It's not in the book. It was Truffaut's and Gruault's choice, I guess. It's terrifying. Jules would no longer dread, as he had from the start, that Catherine would cheat on him or quite simply die, since it had happened now. The narration here is fantastic. Jim's coffin was even larger than life, dwarfing Catherine's at its side. They left nothing of themselves, but Jules had his daughter. Had Catherine loved conflict for conflict's sake? No. But she'd bewildered Jules with it to the point of nausea. A sense of relief flooded over him. Relief! Jules' and Jim's friendship had no equivalent in love. They delighted together in the smallest things. They accepted their differences with tenderness. From the start, everyone called them Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. Here's Fran?ois' concern for detail. Technical accuracy. When Hitchcock saw the film, he was very intrigued by the incineration and asked if that was really done. Did Catholics accept that? That detail struck Hitchcock. The economy of style is very much like in a Hitchcock film. It's amazing. It doesn't render it any less sacred. It's beautiful. And people forget. They only speak of the beauty of their friendship and love. You've always felt that people only remember the euphoria, not the love unto death. The ashes were placed in urns and sealed in separate compartments. Jules would have mingled them. Catherine had always wanted hers scattered to the winds from a hilltop, but it was against regulations. It's magnificent. Thank you for the chance to watch it again. It's nice to see a film during the day.
