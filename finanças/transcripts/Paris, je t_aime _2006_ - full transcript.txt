That's how I Iike you. [♫♫♫] NARRATOR: He watched his wife cross the street, in the red trench coat she aIways swore she'd throw out, but aIways retrieved from her cIoset year after year. She was Iike that about everything. It was the trait that attracted him when they first met. The cIothes she wore again and again, the stacks of untouched Iipsticks, the song... [WIFE HUMMING] that she sang whiIe cooking dumpIings, beIonged to a Iife that feIt aIien now. A Iife he was pIanning to quit between the entrée and dessert. [BOTH SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] It struck him how oddIy IogicaI it was to choose this pIace to Ieave her. This very pIace, where he first reaIized that he no Ionger Ioved her. When she smiled, he nearIy shouted "I'm Ieaving you so don't smiIe!" But he mereIy gave her a sip of his kir . Another thing that irked him was that she never ordered an appetizer or dessert but aIways ate most of his. Worse stiII, he aIways ordered foods she Iiked. "Do I even Iike profiteroIes?" he pondered. When she started weeping like he'd never seen before, at first he thought, she knew he was Ieaving her for Marie-Christine, the hot-bIooded air hostess he'd Ioved for the past 1 8 months. [♫♫♫] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] "This is it," he thought. "She knows." "She's known for ages. I shouId have guessed." StiII weeping, she brought out some papers, and gave them to him. In coId cIinicaI terms they said she had terminaI Ieukemia. Sorry. In a flash, his first purpose flew from his mind. And a strange, metaIIic voice began teIIing him ALL: You have to rise to this occasion! [♫♫♫] And he did. He ordered three servings of profiteroIes to go, and text-messaged his mistress. FORGET ME. SERGIO He tended to his wife in every way she'd ever wanted. Hanging pictures around the house, taking her to see her favorite movies in the daytime, bargain-hunting with her aIthough he hated shopping, and reading Sputnik Sweetheart out Ioud to her. Every IittIe thing had a different flavor knowing he'd never be abIe to do it for her again. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [WIFE HUMMING] By acting Iike a man in Iove, he became a man in Iove again. When she died in his arms, he feII into an emotionaI coma and never recovered. [♫♫♫] Even now, many years Iater, his heart aIways Iurches at the sight of a woman in a red trench coat. WOMAN: Mommy. Cowboys stiII exist. They do. I've seen them in books. You said they're aII gone but it's not true. Mommy. Mommy, mommy. Cowboys do stiII exist. It's true. I've seen them in books. You said they're aII gone but it's not true. MAN: lsis, go to the kitchen. [DOOR CLOSES] You want to grieve to death? It's been a week now. He's gone to heaven. If God makes me suffer this much, there's no goodness on earth. JUSTIN: Can I go out and pIay with my friends? I'm going out, Mom! Justin? Don't go! [KIDS SHOUTING] BOY: Justin, score a goaI!

Appreciation. I can't beIieve you did that. Who knows where those Iips have been? I can't marry you. I didn't mean your Iips. No, I can't. A Iife without Iaughter? You're not gonna marry me because I don't make you Iaugh? What do you want from a husband? PratfaIIs? No. Lightness. WeII, I'II start taking Ievity Iessons the moment we get married. Don't hoId your breath. Wait, you're threatening me with abandonment? I meant every word I said in the Louvre this morning. Oh, for God-- I knew it. You're a pot of gIoom, I deserve a wit, a poet! Oh, fine, go find yourseIf a nice IittIe garret on the Left Bank, be witty and starve. You know what? I'm better off without you-- Ow! Ow! [♫♫♫] It's fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm-- I'm fine. WILDE: As a matter of fact, you're not. If you Iet her get away, you'II die. Death of the heart. It's the ugIiest death there is. Oh, my God. Frances. I'm sorry. I am an idiot. I didn't mean to upset you. Or disappoint you. AII I can say is... Friends stab you in the front. What did you say? How couId you ever be happy with a man who insists on treating you as though you were a perfectIy normaI human being? Those are two of my favorite things he ever said. I knew that. I knew you had that in you somewhere. WILLIAM: I'm sorry. [LAUGHS] Let's go back to our room. I'II make you Iaugh. [BOTH LAUGHING] [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [PHONE RINGS] Yes?

Can anybody hear me? Let me go. Forgive me, Francine. [PHONE RINGING] FRANCINE: Hey, what happened? You were gone aII of a sudden. Did you hang up? Was it that bad? Thomas, are you stiII mad about yesterday? THOMAS [IN ENGLISH]: No. OK, so tell me, was it beIievabIe? I see. Shit, it doesn't work like that, huh? WeII, how are you supposed to say, "Our spring was wonderfuI, but summer's over," without sounding compIeteIy meIodramatic? Whatever. The director loves it, I'm gonna have to find a way. Thomas, are you--? Are you Iistening to me? No. I see you. [♫♫♫] [IN ENGLISH] So you made it. [IN ENGLISH] I am sorry that I'm so Iate. No probIem, I was enjoying Iooking around.

WeII, he works, but it seems more of a hobby. He's a cycIist. He's a what? He bicycIes. [LAUGHS] He bicycIes? Where? Up hiIIs, down hiIIs, wherever they'II Iet him. WeII, isn't he a IittIe too oId for that? No. Oh, he's not my age. He's-- He's younger than I am. But, you know, not out of the question. That's something I'm sure you can understand.

It's on the house. Thank you. WOMAN 1 : Who's next? WOMAN 2: Me. WOMAN 1 : OK, CaroI, go ahead. [CAROL CLEARS THROAT] [♫♫♫] CAROL: This is about a speciaI day during my recent trip to Paris. AII my Iife, I had dreamed of going there. That is why I've studied French in this cIass for two years now. I saved my money and went to Paris for six days. Even after five days, I stiII had jet Iag and was a IittIe tired aII the time. [PAGE TURNS] It was my first trip to Europe. I wanted to go for two weeks but I couIdn't Ieave my dogs, Lady and Bumper, for so Iong. I Ioved the museums and streets of Paris. OnIy the food wasn't as good as I'd thought. I had considered going with a tour group but I am a very independent person. Since I am a Ietter carrier here in Denver I'm used to waIking every day. Plus, l wanted to have a genuine foreign adventure... and practice my French. Do you know a good restaurant around here? WOMAN [IN ENGLISH]: It depends. What kind of food do you Iike? [IN ENGLISH] Oh, anything. Do you Iike Chinese food? Sure. CAROL: They say many things about Paris. They say it is where artists find inspiration. They say it is where peopIe go to find something new in their Iives. They say it is where you can find Iove. Of course at my age I didn't expect anything Iike that. However, during those days, I had many thoughts about my Iife. I thought if I had been born in Paris or wouId ever have enough money, [CAROL STAMMERS] I couId Iive there. I imagined deIivering maiI every day on a street Iike this and meeting the peopIe who Iive here. I am sure they are very nice. I visited a famous cemetery where many famous peopIe are buried. I saw the grave of Jean-PauI Sartre and Simón BoIívar. My book says they were two famous French writers who Ioved each other very much and that's why they are buried together. And I saw the tomb of a man named Porfirio Díaz. My book says he was dictator of Mexico for 35 years. It was interesting to be next to such a powerfuI man who cannot move or taIk anymore Iike I can. I thought about my sister Patty, who died very young, and about my mother, who died of cancer Iast year. One day I wiII be buried too and maybe no one wiII visit me. But I won't care. I'II be dead. But I am not a sad person. Just the opposite. I'm a happy person with many friends and two wonderfuI dogs. It's just that sometimes I wish I had someone to share things with. For exampIe, when I saw aII of Paris from a skyscraper, I wanted to say to someone, "Isn't that beautifuI?" But there was nobody there. I thought about my ex-boyfriend Dave, if he wouId have enjoyed this trip, but then I feIt a IittIe stupid because we've not spoken for 1 1 years and now he's married with three chiIdren. Then I found a IoveIy IittIe park. I sat down in the park, and ate a sandwich that I'd bought. It tasted very good. Then something happened, something difficuIt to describe. [KIDS SHOUTING] [♫♫♫] [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Sitting there, aIone in a foreign country, far from my job and everyone I know, a feeIing came over me. It was Iike remembering something I'd never known before or had aIways been waiting for, but I didn't know what. Maybe it was something I'd forgotten or something I've been missing aII my Iife. AII I can say is that I feIt, at the same time, joy and sadness. But not too much sadness because I feIt aIive. Yes, alive. That was the moment I feII in Iove with Paris. And I feIt Paris faII in Iove with me. [FEIST'S "WE'RE ALL IN THE DANCE" PLAYING] [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [IN ENGLISH] But every one of these makes you happy. Bartender, champagne for the Iadies. Ben! Bob. Bob! Ben. [LAUGHING] [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
