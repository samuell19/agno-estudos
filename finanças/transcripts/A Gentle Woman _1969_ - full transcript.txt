Digitized and restored by Groupe ?clair A Gentle Woman She looked like a 16 year-old. Remember? Yes. I didn't notice her at first. I tried to be witty. A wonderful item! From that moment, I saw her in a particular light... Thought of her in a particular light... The next time, she brought a jeweled amber cigarette holder... Nothing special. I'm doing this only for you. She took the banknotes. I knew she'd return. When she did, we spoke. Her parents had died. She lived with relatives who made her wash dishes and floors. I spend what little they give me on books and paper. This is all I have left. After... After? - I'll have to manage. - How? I don't know. Maybe I'll place an ad, like this one. No... This is how to do it. Young student... Young student seeks position babysitting or housecleaning. Come. Your gold interests me. Better if you keep the Christ and I take the metal. Me? Why? No. Don't scorn what is offered. I've been poor before too, I've seen it all. If I do this detestable job... You avenge yourself on the poor, but not on me? I am part of that power which eternally wills evil... ...and eternally works good I know this quote. You've read Goethe? Not very deeply. Mephistopheles says it when he introduces himself to Faust. You're strange. She meant: "I didn't expect you to be an educated man." I'm sure she thought it. I had pleased her. Museum of Natural History Zoological and Botanical Gardens Say yes, and I'll make you happy. It all seems impossible. All what? Men... a man... And love? You don't love anyone? No. Not yet. It isn't love you want. You want me to agree with you. What do you want? I don't know...something bigger. Contracts bore me. Think about it. Millions of women hope for marriage. Maybe. But there are the monkeys, too. Don't drive around or walk with me, it's right here. I asked you not to follow me. - Why? - This house is sinister... The people are sinister. Say yes, and you can leave here forever. Say yes! Say it! Given your assertions and vows, I declare you united in matrimony. I put a damper on the exhilaration. The apartment and furniture will do until we can afford better. We can go to movies often... ...but rarely the theatre, that's too expensive. We'll need 4 or 5 years to save up capital. What capital? I know you despise money. - I don't care. - Broaden your outlook, you'll see things differently. I wanted settled happiness. Oh, why did we take to silence from the beginning? - Stand up straight, Branchaud. - Smile, Louisette. - Who are those girls? - Peasants, come to lend a hand. How fresh and beautiful they are! What rosy cheeks! I see someone whose eyes are bigger than his belly. - We should have stopped there, I think. - Yes, madame. - Good day, sir cousin to the Count. - Good day, madame. I'm pleased. You're as handsome in the sun as yesterday by candlelight. I'm not quite so pleased. I find you're dressed... - You don't like this dress? - I'm trying to imagine... That it's not there... - Do you know, deep in the park... - The pavilion? I know it. Meet me there after lunch. - After lunch? I can't. - Why? - My tutor is giving me a lesson. - Even on a holiday? He's a very strict man. Poor boy. And when does that lesson end? I can be there at 5 o'clock. Benjamin, where were you? Neither you nor the Count were there to greet your guest. I was sure of her love then. She did love me. Or wanted to. Or wanted to love. During that time, I suffered from incessant jealousy. Where were you? She had a passion for books and records. You know the Natural History Museum? You must go, it's awesome. The same stuff makes up all animals, just arranged differently... ...for a mouse, an elephant, for a man. The Louvre's Venuses and Psyches made me see women as instruments of pleasure. We're also a pair. All within the same pattern - Don't you like flowers? - Me? - What are you looking at? - You. Isn't this dangerous? No. The first quarrels arose when she would pay for anything... ...and overspend. Thank you, thank you. It's easy for you to be generous. It's my money. Maybe. But it gives you no right over me. I have a right to ensure our livelihood. Don't try to rule me with money. I don't want that, understand? Idiot! Coward! Her face changed in an instant. Kindness was replaced by defiance, revolt. I waited all day for her. I'd been given Hamlet tickets. Hurry! Where were you? I need to know. What don't you know? - Judgment. - A hit, a very palpable hit. Stay... Hamlet, this pearl is thine. Here's to thy health. Pass him the cup. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come. - Another hit; what say you? - I do confess. Our son shall win. He's fat and scant of breath. Here, Hamlet, take my napkin... The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet. Gertrude, do not drink, I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me. - It is the poisoned cup: too late. - Come, let me wipe thy face I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by. Part them. Part them; they are incensed. Look to the queen there, ho! They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord? How is it Laertes? Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe; Osric I am justly killed with mine own treachery She swounds to see them bleed. No, no, the drink, the drink O, my dear Hamlet! The drink, the drink! I am poisoned. O, Villainy! Ho! Let the door be locked! Treachery! Seek it out. It is here, Hamlet. Thou art slain. The treacherous instrument is in thy hand unbated and envenomed. The foul practice hath turned itself on me. Lo, here I lie, never to rise again. Thy mother's poisoned. I can no more: the king, the king's to blame. The point! Envenomed, too! Then, venom, to thy work. Treason! Treason! O, yet defend me, friends. I am but hurt Here, thou incestuous murderous damned Dane Drink off this potion. Is thy union here? Follow my mother. He is justly served. It is a poison tempered by himself Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet. Mine and my father's death come not upon thee, nor thine on me! Horatio, I am dead; Report me and my cause aright to the unsatisfied. Never believe it. I am more an antique Roman than a Dane As thou art a man, give me the cup. Let go. By heaven, I'll have it! What a wounded name, Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me! If thou didn't ever hold me in thy heart, absent thee from felicity awhile And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain, To tell my story O, I die! The potent poison quite over-crows my spirit But I do prophesy the election lights on Fortinbras He has my dying voice, so tell him with the occurents, more and less, which have solicited The rest is silence. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince: And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest! Why does the drum come hither? I knew it! They omitted this, so they could bellow throughout. This is Hamlet's advice to the players: Speak the speech as I pronounced it to you, If you mouth it, as many of your players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines do not saw the air with your hand..for in the very torrent, tempest, the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that will give it smoothness... Et cetera... Acting as if nothing was amiss infuriated me. I no longer questioned her. I feared going on without any answers. That night as every night, we drew great pleasure from each other. But she didn't change her ways, and I sought only to possess her body. My real jealous torment soon started... You moved it without telling me. This was his third visit. Suddenly, I wanted to shoot him, shoot her...to destroy them. Do you know what it is to suffer with such a gentle woman? So beautiful? It's a rending, a burning agony. I was sure I'd find them together. She was back, as if nothing happened. Since then, everything was an excuse to quarrel. I believe in fate. If it wasn't the flowers it would've been something else. I thought you didn't like flowers. Who gave them to you? - No one. - Someone did. You're lying Tell me! Let me go! - Where are you going? Stay! - It's no longer possible. I know where you're going. Operation Adler was to destroy the R.A.F. prior to invasion. G?ring promised troop transports would be unopposed in the air. This great air battle lasted from July 1st to August 20th. 1,300 German bombers and 1,200 fighters, against 57 British squadrons. The entire R.A.F. I feared if she stayed out, she might harm herself. Just to torture me. Is it true what they say? You were fired from a bank you managed 3 years ago? I had never told her. Why would I? From pride, I wanted her to guess. I wasn't fired, I resigned over a mistake I didn't make. Then you became more or less a beggar. I was desperate, out of work. And now you work, you've became a financier again. Who had told her? I went to her former home. I needed to know. Was it the boy who came to the shop? They game me a name and address. Boulevard Lannes. I'd forgotten about the gun in my pocket. Why did I decide to walk that way? Suddenly, she sat up and spoke. Get out. Come on. I'd made out a few words. They were to her credit. She might've seen me in the mirror, and thought quickly. No, such doubts were impossible. She had rejected his advances. I expected this. To hurt me, out of hatred, she'd seen this boy, whose face I didn't even try to look at. She was deeply affected... It lasted till we got home. I was exhausted. She just sat in place. It was the first time she didn't sleep beside me. When I woke up, daylight came through the curtains. I pretended to be asleep. I had glanced so quickly, she may have thought I was really asleep. It wasn't likely I'd close my eyes having seen what I had. The thought I'd seen and expected death may have caused her to hold back. She couldn't doubt it. The bed told her I had seen. That I knew. The revolver remained on the table. I'm here, alive. It's me. Look. For 6 weeks you and the nurse cared for her. I spared no expense. I was even happy to spend on her. But I avoided her eyes. After the funeral, I'll go away for a week. No, Anna. Later, wait, stay. To sleep... I'd want to pray, but I can't stop thinking. When she was able to get up, you sat her in that armchair. Thank you, Anna. She also seemed happy to speak little. I told myself she needed time to forget, to get accustomed. Winter went by like a wait time. I often brought her on walks, exercising, and not always in complete silence. PALEONTOLOGY - COMPARATIVE ANATOMY Open Daily (Except Tuesdays) I tried to make it seem like we were never silent. You were right: The same raw materials for all animals. - It's extraordinary. - Yes. Strangely, I could never catch her looking at me. Was it timidity on her part? She seemd so gentle. NATIONAL MUSEUM OF MODERN ART - It's quite a leap from painting to this. - No. I was irritated sometimes, but without hatred. I didn't see her as a criminal. I had forgiven her entirely. She seemed so beaten, humiliated. I felt great pity for her. But also felt a type of satisfaction. I enjoyed our inequality. I bought a few worthless things to help some people as a gesture. I sensed it pleased her to learn of it. She was so pale and had thinned, I was struck by her air of dreaminess. She's weakened from her illness. Take her to the sea... or to the mountains. I feel quite well. Quite well. I didn't realize then, I was still her husband And took care of her like one. She was ashamed. But a month later... Remember? - Is she singing? - Sometimes, when you're away. In my house! Has she forgotten I exist? It wasn't pity for her, it was something else. I was elated for reasons no one could ever understand. Let's talk. It's all my fault: A man's foolish image of women. I wanted to take and not give; take you and give back nothing. You'll have it all, I'll build you a paradise, you'll see. Say something. I want to believe in you, to be bound in utter faith. I love you. I want you. Don't torment yourself. We'll go away, it's decided. This pawn shop is a mistake. We'll go wherever you like. Tomorrow, now, right away! I love you. And I thought you'd leave me. She let those words slip I felt them like knife stabs. As long as I was near her, I couldn't stop hoping. I was happy. I wasn't considering her fear. She said: I thought you'd leave me. Now I move towards her, the husband in need of love. Is the young bird's ability hereditary? When it sings its species' particular song? Or is it learned by listening, through imitation? What will we do? It seems almost certain that, to a variable degree, every bird is predisposed to its characteristic song. We must drop everything and go. Where? I thought only about going, that going was the best solution. Anywhere. Far away... With space and sunlight. We'll live new life together. But we won't be new. We will be. - Can one change? - Completely. Our quarrels and unhappiness will all disappear. Nothing will remain from before. You'll let me adore you, worship you. I want something else. Why? I love you. I'll always love you. Isn't that enough? I love your intelligence. That horrible night I found you on Boulevard Lannes, I saw how kindly you repulsed that boy. With such innocence too. This morning she was still alive Her calm amazed me; I'd tossed all night I shall be a faithful wife. I will respect you. I kissed her wildly, like a husband after a long absence. But why did I then go out? And why did she...why? What's wrong, Madame? Nothing, leave me. No. Come here Are you reconciled? Happy? Yes, Anna, happy. Open your eyes. One second. Just one second.
