I am the servant! H?, servant! where are you going with this step? I'm going to look for my master. I must face the cold to find him. I must find him, come what may, even if I have to face wind or snow. hard is the servant's life! it's not an easy life. very true! Genta, pour another one. hurry up I've had enough. let me go, master what are you talking about? serve me, I'm telling you! nothing left if there's nothing left, have them bring some more - bring some more sak? ! - no don't bother! Genta! you disobey your master? this is intolerable stop, master if you go on drinking they'll kill me Genta... you were talking about being true to sak? at the inn, what exactly does it mean? drinking secretly without the master knowing, what exactly does it mean? I want an explanation! "My master has bad wine." "when he drinks he becomes another man." so you heard everything Genta ! we are in the same boat so let's make up, you and me let's drink a jug of untrue sak? Untrue sak?? what on earth is that? yes, untrue sak?! peddlers! you've been laughing at me for a while. why? we're not, Sire! we're not laughing! I saw you laughing what made you laugh? Sire, I assure you I didn't laugh. you dare lie to me? look at me. you're right. you're not laughing so you agree. if fact, I'm not laughing however, your nose, it's convulsed with laughter I don't like this nose it laughs all by itself it laughs I'll change that nose come here no, master! stay there where are you? master! it's your fault, stupid! idiot! he's dead drunk I'm ashamed of you! wash this for me. Master... Pardon me. I should have looked for you. it's my fault it's my fault I've let myself be distracted by a woman without any worth Sire! thank you Jiro, you can go to sleep. but you're before me. you're sleeping here? I see in this case hold this. shall I give you a hand? could you help me? yes, a worthless woman will help you. what shall we do with him? kick him in the arse. it's over there Sire! Mr. Lancer! H?, masseur! did you come across a certain Tozaburo? he has a beard what did he do? answer me. Ah, pardon, you are blind. it's a thief a thief! little one, nothing broken? Gonpachi, I'm alright? you ointment, please. ah yes! give it to him. breathe. it hurts! we'll soon be there. pull yourself together what an idea to climb a tree my stomach hurts stomach? that's strange you fall off a tree and your stomach hurts you shouldn't have given him money he stuffed himself with kakis. that's what made him sick living in the trees, the idea! I don't agree monkeys live in trees you're right. monkeys live in trees clothes too everybody is against me I'm getting the colic! what? - pull yourself together. - I can't! he's really a nuisance Master, wait for us - I can't hold it any longer. - I see. wipe yourself with it. over there! what's going on in front? they're having a tea ceremony. really? a tea ceremony in the open? - what's that? - a ceremony in the open. oh really? so that's why we're stuck but what's going on? no idea there surely must be something, since we're blocked it looks like we'll be kept waiting for a long time he's a great Lord, surely - it'll take some time. - Surely. what sophistication! you appreciate? it is a unique spectacle! it seems to take a long time tell me peddler, what's going on? an outside tea ceremony my nose does not laugh funny guy Genta, look. hold on, Jiro. we have a sick child can we pass? wait, I'll ask help yourself I thank you no passing. what rotten luck! - I can't hold it! - patience. another colic. - do you have some paper? - I have. the sky looks threatening and we're still blocked! sophistication takes precedence the tea bowl one brings to Edo is still more sophisticated that's true there is a strange cloud at the Fuji's summit bizarre. keep your temper it's a rare phenomenon called "the Fuji umbrella". isn't it? Yes Sire it's due to steam rising from the foot of mount Fuji the wind carries it up to the summit thus taking the form of an umbrella - isn't it so? - yes sire. - good day! - you have a room? how is the sick child? he's got out of it it was indigestion. I was right we must squeeze ourselvers between three customers excuse us Gonpachi, look after the child tonight. dinner is ready here are your plates Otan?... I'd like to drink a little sak?. Miss, bring a jug. Kumakichi may say that the family is sacred he refused to help us. on cannot count on one's own family one had to arrive at that to understand reality. I'm an unworthy father. I've done nothing for you. your sak?. Otan?... would you pour for me? take good care of yourself. I swear... that I'll come and fetch you. Father, don't talk like that. I know very well that I'll never see the village again. I want to tell you... when I left home, I said terrible things to mother. let's not talk about it. tell her I am sorry don't mention it you know... I wanted to leave with a smile but I was violent with her Father, you're leaving already? I mustn't be late. otherwise, I won't have my 30 gold pieces. give me your comb. I'll arrange your hair. is there really no other solution? for 30 pieces... it's disgusting! BUYING AND SELLING WEAPONS is everything alright? since last night, a thief is in the vicinity be on your guard I beg your pardon a thief? where is the master? the spear! Mr. pilgrim! - you're leaving already? - I'm an early riser. it seems a thief roams in the vicinity since last night so it seems the world is an unsafe place you're telling me! impossible to sleep undisturbed it's the thief! don't panic, let's go! the thief, it's him! you must have been dreaming even if he's tatooed? - are you sure? - it's Roku?mon. - he's tatooed. - what? show me your arm it's the thief! if you come closer I'll kill you don't come closer! Master, enter please scum! that's the thief. it's Roku?mon! really? give me your mask! you squeezed it! "you've arrested Roku?mon risking your life. "Accept this award as a token for your courage. "The grateful justice. Onishi Gengobei, commissary. "to samoura? Sakawa Kojuro." this exploit will shine on all of your clan take it. I did nothing it was my servant carrying my spear who... the servant acts for his master it's an individual act. - it was he who... - without his master, he is nothing. this is the police's attitude at least let's recognise these people's bravery take your award one moment please - this is the award? - it is. did you hear? the award, it's this piece of paper they take me for a fool but not at all your ancestral spear has gained in reputation not really, Gonpachi. this spear is a fake. - what are you saying? - impossible! but it is! in fact, I wanted to sell it to help the old man's daughter but it's not worth a penny. this relic of my ancestors' arms bequeathed to us by Ieyasu at Sekigahara, it's trash! I don't believe it the merchant must have lied what does it matter, Gonpachi! finally, this fake spear has brought us nothing but a fake reward. good day. come in please are you Yomosaku's daughter? rather pretty where is your father? we couldn't get here yesterday because of the rain he went out he did? we must have crossed him is Mr. Kyube in? he went out I don't know you Try to remember. I entrusted my daughter to you 5 years ago. I'm Tozaburo. really? Tozaburo? how is my little Oshina? I've brought the money. I'll take her back. Oshina? but you're too late! too late? what do you mean? Oshina... My contract with Mr. Kyube was clear on that point! I can buy my daughter back. for this I've slaved day and night in a mine. here are the 30 pieces plus interest it's that Oshina... she died two years ago what? she died? Oshina is dead! this is too cruel! here you are, the money. well let's go are you ready? Father farewell take care of yourself farewell, father. farewell I thank you all wait! stop! Kyube ! you remember me? Oshina's father, Tozaburo ! why, Tozaburo ! you're a monster! you killed my daughter! if Oshina died it was not of my doing she was ill you're telling me now? don't worry. I'll take you home. give me that girl's contract! take the 30 pieces! give me her contract! give it to me! who do you think you are? one moment! Kyube. still in this dirty business? you never change! let go of him! I should never have doubted you. I beg your pardon! your goodness is an example to all of us excuse me Kyube. hand me the contract at once! in the name of the law! go on! Tozaburo, is that it? thank you! scum! you have nothing more to fear let's go back together. my village is close to yours a great many thanks to you. you've saved us thank you sire! don't mention it when I look at you I feel that my daughter is alive and I tell myself that I didn't slave for nothing. let's stop crying and get ready make way for the great Lord! Master.... are we leaving? I'll range these things thank you very much! you're leaving? let's say farewell to each other why? Me, I'm going in the direction of Izu. really? our ways seperate yes that's so! where is Jiro? he's playing with Okin on the beach. I see your things, master. Mr. Samoura?. I can never thank you enough may God protect you Thank you everything ends well yes, thanks to you I'm beside myself with joy we are so happy for you thanks to Otan?, I'll be able to overcome my grief I hope we'll see each other one day destiny is strange I wish you a lot of luck good-bye Genta. I envy those people I like their simplicity they have the true spirit of fraternity where are you going? Master! where are you going? Master! good day. come in Master. we must take the road bring us sak?. stop it, no sak? ! be silent you'll drink in Edo. be patient. I want to drink don't say anything get up but get up it's just that... sit opposite of me Genta. you are Genta. you are not Kojuro. it's very simple. you are you, and I am I yes that's fair Kojuro is Kojuro. he is not Genta. as you say Genta... listen Kojuro is Kojuro, Genta is Genta. agreed? you are not you master's shadow where are you going? - to Edo. - all alone? No, with Mr. lancer ! - Jiro, you have a daddy? - No. - and a mummy ? - Neither. - what about you? - I've a mummy ! we, the samoura?... do we deserve our high station? Me, I envy the people we just saw their hearts are pure and their acts sincere for fake exploit a fake award. what can one do? if you are your master's shadow then I am my master's also. it's logical. but in this case, whose shadow is my Daimyo? it's insane! toast with us excuse me whatever next! a servant sitting at his master's table... it's inaceptable! a samoura? unworthy of his rank. why unworthy? what does it matter if he's a servant! we're just drinking together, that's all - I'm embarassed by your inanity. - what? it is I who is right every samoura? must keep his rank. you are dishonoring us how dare you! come over. come take position! stop it I beg of you I beg of you stop it I beg you for the love of heaven! stop it stop it where is the lancer on the beach this is horrible! Lancer! your master is in danger! several men against him! make way! scum! I'll let you have it, worm! come here! come! well? get going, coward! My Master! My Master and Genta. under the circumstances Gonpachi, who has shown great bravery avenging his master will benefit from our leniency. the police pleads in his favour with the Daimyo Matsuda?ra. Our Daimyo's answer is after all logical: "Noone in our realm is fool enough "to let himself be slain by a servant." consequently, for the murder of five samourai, Gonpachi won't receive any punishment. he's a good Daimyo. let him pass Sire! take me with you! you mustn't follow me any more I want to become a lancer! - Lancer? - please, take me with you! Idiot! you should never become a lancer! be off! he's mean! he left THE END
