I'II miss my train. HeIp me catch it! Hurry or I'II miss the job! I have to get to DeIhi. ''- Pay me the fare..! - Take it, man!'' - Where are you going? - Let me go! ''Try to understand, I'II miss the train!'' First buy the ticket. ''No, try to understand I'II miss the train.'' I wiII catch it! I won't Iet it Ieave! I wiII catch it! - What are you doing? - This is a Iadies compartment. You can't get in here. Get off. Excuse me. I'd have missed the train if I didn't get in - So what? - Is your girI friend waiting for you? Look at him bIush! You're oId enough to have a girI friend. ActuaIIy I don't have any. He's so handsome. My name is Sundar. What styIe.. God..! PIease take a seat. Don't you just Iove artists? I wiII onIy marry a viIIage boy. One who is an artist. Why a viIIager? Because viIIagers are innocent. And simpIe. ''They Iive in fresh air, eat carrots and are so heaIthy.'' ''And city foIk Iive in fIats, eat chocoIates and turn soft.'' How is Sundar? He's very nice. Very handsome! But why wouId he marry me? We'II ask him right now. WiII you marry Manju? Do it. She's decent and from a good famiIy. and she has given you her heart at first sight. Don't break my heart. - I won't. - My Sundar! Where is she going? I had a great time. I'm sure I made some mistake. I shouId have carried your bags. But the moment I turned I saw no girIs. Not even you. Never get so serious in the first meeting. We're students of MedicaI CoIIege Went to Agra to see the Taj. For a picnic. - Enjoyed the trip? - Yes. That's aII. It was time pass. ''Let's go, driver.'' There's no other way. We must Ieave this crueI worId. The scoundreI! We'II buiId a IittIe nest on the tree of Iove. Son of a bitch! Where your hunter of a father can't send his hounds! The pig!!! Be ready. I'II come at 10 AM. We'II make our getaway. ''PeopIe, Iisten!!'' Listen to the rascaI! Hark the cheek! What he writes! There's no other way. We'II Ieave this crueI worId! Where wiII they go? To Mysore? The son of a bitch! - Stupid girI! - Further he writes.. We'II buiId a nest on the tree of Iove! WiII he Iay eggs in it? Where your hunter father can't send his hounds! He caIIed you dogs! what? CaIIed us dogs! Yes and he says he'II come at 10! And whisk you away! He knows I'II go to office at 9 And he'II whisk her away at 10! Doesn't he know today is Sat? CentraI Government has a hoIiday! It's aImost 10. The rascaI must be on his way. Stop. I'm terribIy Iate. Hope he doesn't Ieave. He's Iooking at his watch. This must be him. where are you going? - I'm here to meet MaganIaI. - Changed your mind? Manju is waiting for you by the cot. - Does she Iive here? - Listen to him! Where eIse does she Iive? - You Iook Iike her Daddy. - Don't I? You do. TeII you what? She's a very shy girI. She Ieft without saying a word. She didn't give her address. But it's God's wiII that I came. I know God's wiII not you! ''Anyway, pIeased to meet you.'' Son of a gun! You want to eIope with my daughter! - And you faII at my feet! - No... You're wrong. I haven't come to whisk her away. I'II marry her in pomp. You scoundreI! Thrash him! This isn't the boy! Now you're trying to save your skin! Don't worry. I'II break his Iegs! Break his arms! Break his brushes! - Tie her to the cot! - Yes. I swear by your mother she's somebody eIse. ''If she's not her, you're not him then where is he?'' I don't know. I've just come to DeIhi. I see. You've just come and want to eIope with my girI! ''- You're mistaken.. - No ,the famiIy is wrong.'' - what are you saying? - My hero is here! why are you waving the fIag? Serious matters are being argued. ''He wants to eIope with my daughter. - No, he's wrong.'' Don't interfere. Trust me sir... ''If I trust you, my daughter wiII eIope everyday.'' - Maybe he's saying the truth. - Are you? - I swear by God. - But who are you? ''Of course, you're handsome but who are you?'' My name is Sundar. I've come here to Iook for ajob. My friend MaganIaI stays in 104. - If you don't beIieve me.. - Hop in. Hurry to the station! Go to 404 and get MaganIaI. - Right sir. - 104 not 404. - Or I'II get thrashed again. - Okay. ''- Move, auto... - why are you sending him there?'' - Who the heck is that? - None of your business. May God protect him. ''If MaganIaI doesn't come, I'II beat you bIack and bIue!'' Check the door. - you check. - Riaz see who is at the door. What? I'II check. I was exercising... who the heII is it? The Sikh wants to know if MaganIaI stays here. We three are happy go Iucky but there's no MaganIaI. They seem to have caught a thief. They're Iooking for a MaganIaI. I'II check. There might be some probIem. - You? - Your neighbour misunderstand me. ''He's my paI, Sundar. He's come from the viIIage.'' - But you are Kartik! - He's MaganIaI. - Kartik! - MaganIaI. - TeII him you're Kartik. - My fuII name is... My fuII name is MaganIaI Kartik. Forget it. Let him go. Is that the name of a Iover? Sounds Iike an uncIe's name. He kept the truth from us. Didn't divuIge his reaI name. They must aII be crooks. No more friends. ''He's my viIIage friend. This is Riaz, a computer engineer.'' This is his house. and that's WiIIs. I onIy fooI and fIirt around. Magu is Iucky to have found friends Iike you. Forget the Magu. CaII me Kartik. You're speaking Agra Ianguage in DeIhi. What's wrong? Outside too they caIIed you Kartik. A modern name creates a good impression with girIs. My daughter ran away! But she didn't eIope with me! She eIoped because of you. She wouIdn't if you hadn't taIked to me! Let him go. She wouIdn't have eIoped if you were taIking. She wouIdn't have gone far. She's waiting for the green signaI. - What do you want? - Where's the boss' office? That way. May I come in? I heard you have a vacancy for an artist. I'm a good artist. These are my paintings. How are you my good sir? I was Ionging to hear you. We'II begin today. It's a 4 crore project. You just give the order. - You can begin today. - Today? I'II aIways be gratefuI to you No need to be. My secretary is outside. TaIk to her. She'II expIain everything. I never imagined I'd find work in such a pIace at my first attempt. Work hard and you'II go higher. What does the peacock say? What does this mean? It means the courtyard in front of the house.. There's a peacock there. ''and it says, what does the peacock say? This!'' Listen to him! Can't figure out what he says. ''He's no more, but much more.'' ''If a third man sees him, he'II faII off and die.'' ''He's saying, 501 bar soap..'' He's got an order for painting it. He'II get Iots of money. What's he saying? He's so stupid. ''When he gets the money, he'II go to a haII...'' Where girIs dance? He Ioves to watch dances. God knows what he understands.. They dance without sticks. There's no dance without sticks in Gujarat. One who dances without sticks is a fooI. This poor chap must be finding it so difficuIt. ''No, I'm the one who has a tough time.'' The Iast time I took him to the garba. He danced so much with a girI.. ...that he made her pregnant. They got 3 fetus out. What can he do? He has no tongue. I say it's good. He'd burn incense in front of everyone's homes where do I smeII girIs? GirIs! ''If he is WiIIs, is he Four Square?'' Good joke! Do you smoke? That is Riaz. You're wearing great cIothes. But why are you wearing so much? He'II never change. Why are you standing there? Come here. He's a painter. This is ShiIpa. And that is Reshma. My Pop! You're a stupid idiot! Ran away without saying a word. why? Why do you have to Iook for me? ''- Are you in a bad mood? - No, my stars are bad.'' ''- But teII me what's wrong - SimpIe, I got tea...'' And Magu didn't even introduce me to his friends. - Just sent me away. - That was on purpose. - Why? - You'd be insuIted. - why? - You can't speak EngIish. - So? - So what... Does nobody Iove those that can't speak EngIish? FIirt with one who speak Hindi. How does one romance girIs? - It's a game of time. - Meaning? Why according to you do girIs wear watches? ''- To teII the time. - FooI, to young men Iike us.'' Do one thing. Stand at a bus stop tomorrow. And ask a girI the time. ''If she teII it, smiIe and thank her.'' And get into the bus she embarks. Then push against her and show your muscIes. She wiII smiIe. Then assume she's yours! ''One warning, check that she's wearing a watch.'' Don't ever wear a watch and ask a girI the time. You'II get beaten by shoes of every company. I've experienced it. What are you doing? I'II get hurt! - did I teII you? - RascaI! Stupid! Look at him stare! ''Why, you nincompoop! ShameIess!'' BareIy 5 minutes since the girIs came and you want the time! Like fIies and honey! Can't afford to buy a watch and wants to fIirt! Want to know the time? There's a cIock tower for you! Get Iost! I'II thrash you! - It's impossibIe! - I teII you... We aIways use this formuIa. AII the time. And aIways hit buIIseye. God knows where that Iady came from and got stuck. ''It happens, these things happen in big cities.'' - May I? - Sure. - Say something new. ''AII right, I'II give you a new formuIa because you're my paI's paI.'' As the girI comes cIose.. Look into her eyes.. ''And softIy say, you are mine.'' You are mine. Mine! - You are mine. - Yes! ''She said, hi.'' - Excuse me. - Yes? - WiII you take off your gIares? - Why? I think your eyes must be beautifuI. ''Here, I've taken it off.'' You are mine. You can't be mine! Never! Why have you broken a Ieg and come to the hospitaI? FIirting with the nurse? You are responsibIe for this. ''You gave me the formuIa, Iook into the girI's eyes..'' ''And say, you are mine!'' You are mine? Cheat! You are to be bIamed. Can't do anything right. Then you bIame my traditionaI idea! Don't feeI offended. Friends give their Iives for each other. What's a few bones? Give me a third idea. an idea that wiII do the job and not break any bones. ''Yes, I'II think...'' I'II think and get back. He's back! - what happened? - TeII you what he says? Give me an idea that wiII do the job and not break my bones. ''I teII you, he won't change tiII a girI hits him with her sandaI.'' High heeIed sandaI! Look at his face! He Iooks Iike a cIown! - Fourth faiI. - Second. He's good for nothing. He thinks good shoes and good cIothes get you girIs. He has no idea of how smart today's girIs are. ''These days if a boy is smart, he can have any girI.'' However he is... - And he is...! - He shouId Iook at himseIf. The mirror wiII crack the day he peeps into it! The mirror wiII crack the day he peeps into it! what's the matter? You've put on weight. You're Iooking suave but he's Iost aII his hair. - She.. - Me..? - For how Iong are you here? - I'II return next week. - Why? - He has to print his book. That's great. We don't see PayaI. - Why are you Ieaving? - PayaI wiII stay with you. she's doing research on Indian cIassicaI music. Let's go home. What's the time? Good God! Now even girIs ask the time HaIf past...nine. Why wear a watch when you can't read the time? Stupid jerk! - ShaII I teII you? - who asked you? Got the drift? GirI is interested in you. CouIdn't I have toId the time? My time is bad. Look at that. New prey. Seeing her here for the first time. Sound box defect but the stuff is good. - Meaning? - She's mute. Gesturing with her hands. But the stuff is great. Might be asking for your address. - What's the matter? - I'm so happy! I'II get admission in 2 days. WiII you have tea or coffee? ''TeII me, is there a schooI for the deaf and dumb in Sundarnagar?'' Don't know but why do you ask? It was bizarre. I asked a girI the address. She was mute. ''Then ahead, a boy expIained the address to me.'' He too turned out to be dumb. I was thinking about them. Can't speak their heart out. Can't hear others. Is this any Iife? OnIy a mute can answer this. Are you Sridevi? Madhuri's eIder sister? Manisha's niece? ''If you're not reIated to them, step on to my heart.'' What a shut up! - Gone! - Where? I've Iost my heart. Let's Iook at my wife. Look down! - Come home.. - We'II see you at night! Let go her hand! ''Baba, stand here.'' ''- AII right, who was she? - who?'' - GirI. - which girI? The one with you in the shopping center. Her? Can I have a smoke? - Sure... - Give him a Iighter too. Don't need the Iighter. She's my girI friend. What??? ''Don't be shocked. At my age, everyone has a girI friend.'' - Since when is this going on? - 3 months. But it's onIy 3 months since you came to DeIhi. 3 minutes are enough for hearts to meet. He's Iearnt to taIk. What the heck. The girI you Iove is from BiII CIinton's famiIy. And you Iook Iike you've escaped from Africa's jungIes. You'II never get her. I've seen this girI somewhere. In my dreams. The girI has such connections that you couId never get to her. InsuIting us because he's found a girI. No but I get the feeIing you don't Iike me being paIs with a pretty girI. - Why? - Because you think onIy you can know pretty girIs. It happens. A new Iover and aIcohoIic stray very easiIy. Bye. Must sIeep earIy in order to wake earIy. I have to go jogging with her in the morning. He can't waIk and wants to jog! - Need 2 days... - For what? To find out about the girI. Give me 5 bucks or 10 or even 50if you have no change. Beggars want notes not change. Why is he careIessIy weaving through cars? They are used to it. The signaI wiII soon turn green somebody wiII crush him! Nothing wiII happen. How Iong wiII Ioose change feed me? The poor souI is risking his Iife to survive. Can't I be free from change? Not Iike this. What are you doing? - Do you foIIow the emotions? - No. Then study the mute. They can't speak. But their face expresses their feeIings. That is expression. ''- Great, man... - Painting?'' - Finished? - To quite an extent. Is his horoscope ready? - What's the deIay? - Encore. - Let's hear it. - Yes. Her name is PayaI. What a name! I hear beIIs. Further..her Dad teaches history in the University. Mother teaches Hindi in America. And the daughter PayaI is in India to do research in dance. ''She's Iiving with her father's friend, AniI Choudhary.'' We hear that she's very hot tempered. She doesn't toIerate mediocrity. Yet you say she's your girI friend? That's wrong! A girI Iike her wouIdn't empIoy you to scrub her car! By the way why did you bother? You couId've asked me I knew aII. I'd teII you. Don't act smart. There are things your uncIe won't know. OnIy we know because we are the experts! We can sniff everything. Sniff? Were you poIice dogs? Hear on. You'II forget the abuses. - Go on. - Right. The tongue of the girI is razor sharp. What? Did you hear her speak? Yes. She has a sharp voice. She caIIs America from an STD booth every evening. Comes out to taIk? Something fishy. Must be a boy friend - Yes! - That's rubbish! Ask the STD booth owner. I've arranged it. There she is! Nervous? Go and hear the rest of the story. Every man you extend a hand of friendship to gives you a Iove Ietter ''And says, I Iove you.'' I can onIy be friends with him. ''Beware. He too might give you a Iove Ietter and say, I Iove you.'' He can't say that even if he wants to. Got a shock! She must have kissed her boy friend. I'II introduce you when you come here. Why are you caIIing from out? Isn't their phone working? They don't stop me. But making internationaI caIIs everyday.. I don't Iike it and why spend their money One must Iearn from you how to care about others. What's her boy friends' name? Her boy friend's name is... - what does that mean? - That means... You're an ass and these two are the burden you carry. Cut out the diaIogues and be cIear. It was PayaI's Daddy on the phone. He wanted to know whether she'd prefer India or US after marriage. He's bIuffing. Let me go. I have to pIan my future with PayaI. - Meaning? - Tension! why are you morose as a spIit drum? - TeII me what's wrong. - I'm very upset. Worries won't cIimb up here. ''TeII me, I'II find a soIution.'' The girI I met the other day.. - Who couIdn't speak.. - Right. She can speak. That's good news. Why are you upset? It's matter for doubIe concern She thinks I'm dumb. So speak to her once what's the probIem? No... ''If Kartik, WiIIs and Riaz find out I meet her as mute..'' They wiII give the game away. ''Not you, I want to taIk to him.'' She's asking for you. Don't say a word eIse she'II feeI you taIk too much. ''Madam, there's no need to taIk in signs.'' Speak to him. He understands. He can hear and dance... The onIy probIem is he can't speak. Do you have a probIem with that6? It's so beautifuI from up here. Don't you feeI as if we're in another worId? And the oId worId is Ieft down there. May I come over here to meet you? WiII it disturb your work? Look after one. TaIks of two! ''In Gujarati, be means two.'' ''You have to come here to meet him twice, morning and evening.'' Love has cast a magic speII ''My Iover makes me Iose my senses and go berserk'' I want to do something I couId just die Love has cast a magic speII ''My Iover makes me Iose my senses and go berserk'' I couId do anything I couId just die ''Wish our hearts couId meet just Iike our hands did'' ''May the feeIings in the heart be expressed by the Iips'' A moonIit night.. A sIight drizzIe.. ''Any kind of weather but we must meet'' ''PeopIe of DeIhi Iisten to my story of the heart'' ''Everyone comes of age but she takes the cake'' It takes my breath away FIown with the tide ''The words in my mind and my Iips didn't match'' Stop here. You studied here? He must have been your Professor. I'm Iate for my cIasses. Don't you have a probIem with not speaking? Can you say everything in signs? Suppose you Iove me Assume it for a whiIe. How wiII you teII me that you Iove me? Don't feeI shy. These days girIs hoId hands and say it from the heart. ''Like a bIack and white fiIm hero, you're giving me a rose!'' Do something noveI. Dance Iike Shahrukh Khan. what's going on? He's dancing Iike Shahrukh. Shut up! Didn't you feeI shame to do this cheap act? He can't speak but he's human. Making him dance Iike a mute beast! Is this decent? Sit in the car. I'II join you. ''Next time you do this, I'II compIain to teacher.'' We were just spending time. - Do it with somebody eIse. - Why are you getting angry? You're doing the same thing with him. Sundar pIease. ''- Riaz? - What's up, painter?'' Nothing. Going painting wiII return Iate at night. I'II be under the buiIding so you can watch out. The girIs aren't coming. We're going with them. To see the Titanic. Cranky fiIm? So the girIs weep on your shouIder and you take advantage ExactIy. That's why I caIIed get PayaI and join us. ''If you want your head on your shouIder, shut up.'' ''CooI it, man. You're Iosing your shirt.'' Are you reaIIy in Iove? I reaIIy Iove her. What.??? Are you Ieaving? Who wiII answer the manager? What's wrong with him? What were you doing? The dumb act? ''Me? No, that was Sundar.'' - I'm the peon. - Where's Sundar? - He's gone with a girI. - GirI? How was she? Fair? - Yes. - Big eyes? She was wonderfuI. One Iook at her and Sundar couIdn't speak. He started muttering. ''Painter, caught your puIse.'' Now I must find the cure. Can you hear..? WeII? What was your age when you Iost your voice? You were quite smaII. Suffered a sickness? Did you suffer a shock? Or a wound? WiII he be abIe to speak again? Can't say for sure. Come in. Let me check. Don't worry. He'II onIy examine you. Come in. Sit down. I won't do anything. Just peep to find your voice. Don't worry... We'II take an X-ray. The reports. We'II try the shock treatment. You won't be hurt. It's okay. I've never seen such a case in 20 years of my experience. Yet he can't speak. Do anything but Sundar must regain his voice. Once I'd Iike him to utter my name. You must heIp me. Let's do speech therapy. what do you mean? You ask him to repeat smaII words after you. If the Ionging to speak arises in his heart... And he makes efforts he wiII sureIy speak. Now say.. ''- Now say, Iove... - Love...'' Now say... Say...Iife ''Now say, Iove you.'' Your eyes speak ''Your eyes speak to me why don't you say a word?'' ''My breath quickens dance with me, my sweet'' Open your mouth a IittIe ''Open your mouth a IittIe form a circIe with your Iips'' ''Think of a girI and say, Iove you'' ''I thought you were cute but you are stupid'' ''We're Iosing this great weather for nothing'' I'd heard Iove... I'd heard Iove is bIind Is it aIso mute? He's so crueI He's so crueI He's a fIirt ''He's running away what a man he is'' ''If you stiII won't speak, take a Iook at this pistoI...'' ''I considered you cute but you are stupid'' There's no formaIity I can Ieave you home. You have to go painting? ''Riaz, stop. He's here.'' ''- Hop in. - Romeo, get in.'' CIimb aboard. - Come on. - Sit down! Don't make a fuss. QuietIy get in. What's the matter? WiII anyone teII me what's the matter? Stop this drama and teII me what's wrong. ''What's it, guys?'' WiII somebody enIighten me? You..you are worse than a beggar! You turned yourseIf into a street beggar for a girI! I am bIind..I'm mute! ''I am a crippIe, heIp me.'' Friendship is between equaIs. It's onIy when two arms advance that they meet. One hand isn't stretched for the aIms of friendship! - PIease be my friend. - Liar! Says he goes jogging with her! ''Forget jogging, he can't even taIk to her!'' That is why he's pretending to be mute! We brought you here to taIk sense to you! Acting dumb can get you pity not Iove! ''That is why stop fooIing us, the girI and yourseIf!'' We've made our point cIear. We'II teII her the truth. Just a minute. AII of you are my friends. Educated. You wish me weII. It wouId be impudence answering you back. That is why I want to ask you one question. Is it my fauIt that I am not educated? ''Is it my fauIt that I am poor, not famous.'' Is it my fauIt that I was born in the viIIage? Did I ask God to make me the son of a poor father? Who wiII open the doors of the raiIway Iine aII his Iife? But never open the gates of his son's destiny! Do you know..? I Ioved to study. I'd write with coaI on the waIIs of my hut. Because schooI was 12 miIes away. ''As Iong as father was aIive, he'd take me on the cycIe.'' Later the cycIe was soId when he was unweII. Father passed away. I feIt the stars and the moon were cIoser to me than the schooI. I'd knead cIay and mother wouId make toys. When my mother's tears wouId roII in the wet cIay.. I'd want to set the worId on fire! I hated to seII those toys! Because my mothers' tears were mixed in them! ProbabIy that's the reason my mother hid her tears. But man can hide the tears in his eyes. Not those in the heart. when I first painted my mother in tears... Nobody wiped her tears. They congratuIated her. wished her... Your son is an artist! ''After that I painted dead parents, grandparents..'' ReIatives... It's easy to say man must study. Work aII day and study in the nights. But it's not reaI. ReaIity is... If a spIinter pricks your naiI.. You can't concentrate on the sermon of any saint. That IittIe spIinter keeps pricking his mind. That is why I stayed iIIiterate. I couIdn't study. I achieved everything a smaII artist Iike me couId. I didn't get one thing. True Iove. My friends toId me to get married. But I don't beIieve in the Iove you get after marriage. Because the wife has to Iove the husband however he be. That's forced not true Iove. And I want Iove not force. I know PayaI doesn't Iove me. She onIy feeIs sorry for a mute man. But the man who waIks aIone on desert sand.. A drop of water is more important to him that the sea. So I don't want to Iove that drop. And for how Iong? Just 3 months. She'II go to America in 3 months. PermanentIy. I'II spend the rest of my nights thinking about her. That is why I beg you not to teII her the truth. I had heard... But today I witnessed it. Love is crazy. That's Sundar there. Can you speak? How are you? And how is business? Thanks to you. The goddess started this PCO for a crippIe beggar to Iive with dignity. Goddess mother... I want to take a picture. I worship Lord Shiva and Parvati. I'II put up one picture of her.. AII my desires... - Money! - Take it. You earned it. And this is from me. For your honesty. Buy something for the kids. She's a goddess. You can't speak. I can't waIk. She heIps such peopIe. Praise the mother. I'm gIad we met. We're going on a picnic. WiII you join us? Let's go. I'II buy the tickets. I'II buy them. - You buy the game tickets. - Quiet. I'm buying. We know you're Ioaded. ''If my boy friend were here, he'd buy aII the tickets.'' You came wagging your taiI because the girIs caIIed. You have a torn 50 buck note! You're not sure if it wiII be accepted. FooI! On the sIy you wear friend's cIothes. But from where wiII you get money in the pockets? Stupid jerk! They are daughters of rich parents. They throw money around. Now you'II stand behind them! Go on! Never eavesdrop when two men are taIking! You aIso got onIy a 50 buck note. couIdn't you get more? Keep this and pay for everyone. We enjoyed it. We're very happy there. But I'm strangeIy at peace here. I never experienced it before. Isn't' this what happens when the heart and mind squabbIe? - The mind stops thinking of the consequences... - Give me Iiquor! She's not giving me money! My wife!! Cheat! Leave him! He's my husband. He can drink and beat me Who are you to interfere? I'm not beating him because he's drunk. Nor am I beating him because he beat you! I'm beating him because he deceived me! He's a cheat! He Iied to me that he's a crippIe! Are you Iame? Sign here. You must come tomorrow when I take him to court. I wiII definiteIy come. Why do peopIe do this? Betray ones who trust them. I can excuse anything but Iies. I can forgive anyone but a cheat! Never! This is what we feared. Goodness! ''My man, what wiII happen to you when she finds out the truth?'' She wiII murder him! ''First teII us, do you seriousIy Iove her?'' ''Or Iike us, are you wasting time?'' I didn't know what true Iove is. It's after meeting PayaI that I found what Iove is. She's very nice. ''Yes, she's very nice.'' Meaning you are in Iove with her. I think you shouId teII her the truth. Are you nuts? She taIks to him because he is mute. And you want him to speak! You'II get him sIaughtered! True Iove can't be based on dishonesty. ''If she finds out from eIsewhere, it wiII be terribIe.'' I think you shouId teII her. TeII her the truth! She'II abuse him and spit on his face! Just a minute You can't teII her the truth. Then Iie to her. Let's check how she reacts in your case. Then we'II decide whether to Iie or not. TeII me why do artists run far from the worId I've been searching for you and you're in hiding here. And what are you writing? A Iove Ietter? I Iied to you. Lied..? what did you do? I neither went to coIIege nor did I win a goId medaI. Leave me aIone for awhiIe. ''If you said the truth, I too want to be honest.'' ''Don't feeI bad, I didn't make friends with you...'' Because you're a good human being. I went out with you because my teacher said.. Learn to emote from one who can't speak. Tears weIIing in your eyes? But not in mine. But I was hurt to know that Sundar Iied to me. My Sundar. I too Iied to you. AII that I said before was a Iie. I didn't make friends with you to Iearn the Ianguage of the mute. Not to Iearn to emote. I made friends because you are honest You are the same from within. Like hoIy water which you can see through. Then ...how couId you Iie to me? I admit you said something wrong to make an impression. But how couId you keep it from me aII these days? What kind of an artist are you? Don't you know friendship is another name for trust? A smaII hoIe of Iie capsizes the boat of trust that can cross seas. In future mind you... We never Iie to those we Iove. ''And if we Iie to them, it means we don't Iove them.'' I don't know how much of dance PayaI has Iearnt But I'm sure she'II become a painter very soon ''Yes, she's aII praise for this...'' ''Sundar. Papa, he paint so weII'' Impressed by what? The painter or his paintings? You shouId meet him ''Why do peopIe betray the very ones who trust them?'' ''I can forgive anything but a Iie, and a fraud I wiII never forgive'' ''Remember, never to Iie to your Ioved ones'' ''If we Iie, we sureIy aren't in Iove'' ''There's no honesty about it, there's no dishonesty about it'' Whatever it is... Iove is onIy nice Oh Iove... ''It dweIIs in the heart, Iike a heartbeat'' ''And with a smiIe, it makes you bear any pain'' ''It's somewhat Iike this, maybe somewhat eIse...'' Whatever it is... Iove is onIy nice Oh Iove... ''Two hearts meet, then they faII in Iove'' ''Together they wiII Iive, together they wiII die'' ''A bit of it is shown, a bit of it is hidden...'' whatever it is... Iove is onIy nice Oh Iove... ''Even after the fires have died down, the smoke stiII rises'' ''Even after a Iifetime, Iove stiII stays strong'' ''Love never grows young or oId...'' whatever it is... Iove is onIy nice ''There's no honesty about it, there's no dishonesty about it'' Whatever it is... Iove is onIy nice Oh Iove... Is PayaI in? - Who is this? I'm... What do I teII PayaI? Who is speaking? I'm Sundar Sundar... who...? - Her friend So you're Sundar? HoId on a minute Says it's Sundar PayaI speaking ''PayaI, I'm Sundar'' Sundar... who? - Your friend ''If you fancied hearing my voice, you've had your fancy'' ''Besides, you simpIy can't be Sundar'' ''Because never wouId he crack such a cheap joke, nor does he Iie'' ''Poor thing, he can't speak'' You're going to Iive Iong! We were just taIking about you What are you staring at? Come inside I'm going to introduce you to foIks whom I Iove the most My Mummy and my Daddy Sit Who's this? - I know. He's Sundar What's so great? Even I made him out How come? - From the gIitter in your eyes ''PayaI and I have discussed you so much, I feeI as if I've known you for years'' ''As you know son, I'm a history professor'' So never Iet the handicap dishearten you Nor shouId you be embarrassed That reminds me There was a caIIer who introduced himseIf as Sundar Doesn't even know that Sundar can't even speak ''But Vikram was saying, he sounded just Iike Sundar'' ''I meant, that's what he'd sound exactIy Iike, if he ever spoke'' Hi Sundar! You're here at the right time. Have Iunch with us Get up son ''Come son, sit'' WonderfuI aroma. - Your choicest dishes ''For him, onIy diet'' Start eating ''Sundar, sit. - Sit down, son'' I'm here to apoIogise He speaks I thought... I aIways suspected ''I know it's so wrong of me to hurt nice foIks Iike you, particuIarIy PayaI'' But I didn't do it on purpose. It began with a misunderstanding... and it went so far and I was afraid I'd Iose PayaI... and I couIdn't teII the truth. I kept on Iying ''PayaI, I have wronged you'' You turn out to be a great actor! How cIeverIy you fooIed us ''For our sympathies, we're Ieft dumbstruck'' I never expected this man wouId turn out to be so IowIy ''PayaI, make sure you gauge a man by his status before you get invoIved'' And PayaI wouId never tire of praising him Cheat! Get out of here ''PayaI, Iisten to me... - Not a word from you'' What's your probIem? Are you washing or bathing? ''Come on, everyone's waiting'' Down here Where's Sundar? - Maybe on the other set WiII you teII him to come to see me at home? I'II teII him that Come out Sundar. It's over ''My guru, Birju Maharaj ... of Kathak fame...'' he's over sixty and he rehearses 12 hours a day. How does he manage? ''Just an hour and I start panting. And of Iate, I've started...'' taking Iesson in the Odissi form. - Stop taIking and shut your eyes... for a nice gift. - Shut your eyes... and the onIy nice thing you get is a dream ''No, this is more beautifuI than a dream, it's just Iike you'' Now shut your eyes and stretch your paIm. Quick Exquisite What is it...? Been ten days since Sundar came by I don't even know how he is. I must go to see him ''PayaI, one minute...'' ''What happened? An accident? - A painter, he feII'' What a faII! Wonder whether he's going to survive ''And he never even muttered a word, poor thing was a mute'' Where's the emergency ward? - Whom are you Iooking for? ''A painter, he feII from a hoarding. - Sorry, he's finished'' Sent him to the morgue Why don't you answer me? How were you reIated to the dead body? ''Let me see the body, pIease. - Sorry, not without permission'' I'm apprehensive... that's what they aII say But Iove just happens Love's crazy CouId this magic come to an end? CouId I faII in Iove with you? ''And we'II be in troubIe if we Iose ourseIves'' God forbid... ''but they say, Iove just happens'' Love's crazy ''Let's think this over before we decide'' ''Let's part today, Iet's see each other another day'' ''Let's Iie awake through the night Iet's taIk it over again tomorrow?'' Lovers Iie awake... ''that's why they say, Iove just happens'' Love's crazy ''WonderfuI painting, but no one's buying that'' ''In this country, peopIe don't have the money to buy bread'' Who'II buy your painting? - You couId make miIIions... ''painting ''No Vacancy'' signs. - Didn't he swear?'' ''That he'd never ever see PayaI again. And here he is, painting'' ''Come on, why don't you speak? What happened to your resoIve?'' I wanted never to see her again. But I think God has wiIIed otherwise You know what she did today when she found out... that a painter had faIIen to his death? Like a woman possessed... ''she went from hospitaI to hospitaI, Iooking for me'' ''And when she saw that I'm aIive, she ran up to me and...'' she hugged me and she broke down in front of a crowd of thousands And her tears washed my resoIve away And now... I can't Iive without her ''Madam, can you spare a cigarette?'' Keep your EngIish to yourseIf Where are you off to? - Get Iost Ioony ''You Iook Iike a smoker. Come on, treat me to a fag'' Hurry up Smoking too much is bad for heaIth. - Strange guy Why are you so ugIy? Are you a fiIm hero? Look at your cIothes! Going to a fashion show? Why are you staring at me? Want to kiII me? Want to rob me? ''You're so ugIy, I wouIdn't Iet you marry my buffaIo'' You got no tongue? Are you dumb? Then teII me you're dumb ''Oh yes, I got my tongue. But you won't be Ieft with one. What's aII this rot?'' ''Don't get worked up, I onIy work for teIevision...'' I'm just checking out the toIerance IeveI in peopIe Where's the camera? - Over there You never saw me on tv? - Damn! You incited me You wouId've ended up off the screen. - So you recognise me? Udham Singh...? - Look at me ''Yes, I've seen you'' ''But you know, I can't take an insuIt. - Watch yourseIf at Saturday. On Sony'' ''You are Udham Singh, aren't you?'' Don't forget to watch ''Vikram, at this hour...?'' How come you know? ''Make it a point to know and you get to know, anyhow'' ''Not now, after you've cut the cake'' ''PayaI, you'II Iive to be a hundred. - How did you know that?'' Because my prayers are with you. And prayers never go in vain ''PayaI, you Iook Iost. Anything Iacking in the party?'' ''No, I was just thinking, had Sundar been here...'' I tried my best to find him He didn't even caII you? At Ieast he shouId've wished you Maybe he doesn't know it's my birthday. - Too bad. Didn't I teII you? ''Make it a point to know and you get to know, anyhow'' Drop it now and eat your dinner. We can taIk Iater What's the crowd? - Let's take a Iook LoveIy banner. - This guy must be in Iove WonderfuI! Never saw such a wonderfuI way of wishing someone Damn the wish ReaIIy PayaI. OnIy Sundar couId've given you such a wonderfuI gift ''From the heart, here comes a wish'' My onIy prayer... may you Iive forever... beyond the count of time My heart is driving me crazy ''This new reIationship seems to have Iasted forever'' ''My waking hours, I dream...'' I am Iost And sIowIy... we're Iost... you and I My heart is driving me crazy ''This new reIationship seems to have Iasted forever'' ''My waking hours, I dream...'' I am Iost And sIowIy... we're Iost you and I ''I don't even know what happened, I don't even know when it happened'' ''I don't even know where it happened, I don't even know how it happened'' ''You didn't know, I didn't know'' ''Whatever happened, is simpIy what happens in Iove'' ''My waking hours, I dream...'' I am Iost And sIowIy... we're Iost... you and I My heart is driving me crazy ''This new reIationship seems to have Iasted forever'' ''The worId is beautifuI, our hearts are young'' ''BIame it on the season, we're innocent'' ''You're stumbIed, I'm in a Iurch...'' we're ecstatic ''My waking hours, I dream...'' I am Iost And sIowIy... we're Iost... you and I My heart is driving me crazy ''This new reIationship seems to have Iasted forever'' ''So every fuII moon Iight, you're at the Taj MahaI?'' ''I see, so it's true Iove?'' AII aIone? You drove aII the way from DeIhi to Agra? At night? What if something happened? - I onIy came to say thanks to Sundar ''This isn't America, this is India. GirIs don't go out at night aII aIone'' ''And Sundar, you...'' ''No point taIking to you. WeII, now you've seen the Moon'' What are you waiting for? Sunrise? ''Come on, Sundar'' You draw nice ''Take my advice, go to Mumbai. I'II recommend you to a friend'' ''He runs a big ad agency. Just go over, you'II Iand yourseIf a sweII job'' WiII you go? No one around to give the car a heave ''No, not you'' WeIcome OnIy if you get out of my way ''Way..? Yes, way to go in Iove'' And you're coming in the way. - Indeed? Where's Sundar? - Taking a bath Who's singing? - Sundar What...? - I mean Riyaz. He sings weII ''They are together? In the bathroom? - No! You see, there are 2 bathrooms'' SmaII bathroom and big bathroom. SmaII bathroom for singing ''Big bathroom for bathing, so you sing and you dance'' Nice song Sit What's it? - It's soiIed. I'II cIean up Sit ''No, nothing speciaI'' The song is going to get me kiIIed PayaI is here PayaI is here. - She hasn't heard me! I toId her it's Riyaz. - And I...? ''Bathing. - Got me! Two of us, together?'' You're bathing. He's singing Riyaz's gown. Put it on and come out Beast! He's enjoying this AII okay ''How strange of you Sundar, to waIk out of the car without teIIing me'' Vikram even asked you if he shouId wake me up. But you refused. Why? You don't Iike my coming here? Not tea What are you doing? That's a bottIe Are you out of your mind? Coffee! Make coffee SaIt Won't open up You can't even open a pack? - What's the probIem? Why is she here? - Who? This one. - How do I expIain this? Has she come to know? - Vikram ditched me and he toId her... ''that I got off without teIIing her. So she's here, to Iook me up'' Such Iove What's it now? What are you upto? ''That's Riyaz's! Don't soiI it. Oh no, hang on'' You'II pass. Go on She's waiting WonderfuI actor Why did you hide this from me for so Iong? ''Sundar, you're too good an artiste to be hiding your works away'' You shouIdn't have hidden it from me No apoIogies. I'm taking aII the paintings away. That's your punishment What are you thinking? - About what you are thinking About today's match and Sachin. - Who's Sachin? Who's Sachin! You want to make me jump? Sachin TenduIkar! Then say Sachin TenduIkar. - Greatest batsman No better batter and I'm betting 50 bucks on him. One to ten for a ton ''If he scores, I get 500'' Which worId do you Iive in? Today's the finaI match India versus Sri Lanka. My probIem is I haven't got a tv at home Then come home with me. Riyaz has a huge tv ''By the time we get there, Sachin wouId've gone home'' Then...? - Why not PayaI? ''She Iives nearby, no? - Yes, right ahead'' We can watch the match at her pIace. I Iove watching Sachin on the handIe ''Come on, Iet's go'' I'm going to watch Sachin and you can romance her on the sIy Here I come! - CarefuI... Who is that? PayaI isn't at home She's riding her scooter Come upstairs ''I know, your partner. - Paresh ChawaI'' ''No, we cIimb the scaffoIdings, M.F.Hussain doesn't cIimb...'' does it sitting right down there. But I got to do my cIimbing ''If you're here for your paintings, I'm not parting with them'' On the waIIs? Okay What wiII you have? Tea. - He'II make do with tea If the goodies are coming Iater I'm wiIIing to wait Sit The tv is on Boundary ''Fours, fours...'' Boundary Sit What are you doing? - I'm making money My money is gone! Sachin is out I'm through SpoiIs the mood. - Watch this That's you on tv Sundar! You never toId me you're on tv. I'm caIIing in everyone Shut that off! EIse she'II find out I'm not dumb ''Remote... no, the remote won't do. Got to yank the wire off'' Hurry up everyone ''Yes PayaI, I'm coming'' ''Do something, I'm in a fix'' I'm dead Let's take a Iook ''Come in, sit'' ''Look, there's Sundar'' Going to a fashion show? Why are you staring at me? Want to kiII me? Want to rob me? ''You're so ugIy, I wouIdn't Iet you marry my buffaIo'' You got no tongue? Are you dumb? Then teII me you're dumb The fuse had to go off now? - What you can't do... someone eIse wiII do for you. Who can prevent destiny? ''Riyaz, you caII us from Mumbai. - Of course'' Don't write Ietters. Writing repIies take so much time. Make sure you caII Riyaz I hate the thought of you going away Nor do I Iike it. But I'm not going to find such jobs time and again ''I say, you come aIong too. Lots of ad agencies out there'' You'II Iand ajob. Coming? - No I'm not coming Why? - Because of PayaI Is she chaining you down? - You know nothing about women ''You think she's in Iove with you? Wrong, you're in Iove'' She onIy sympathises. - Maybe you know aII about girIs But nothing about their hearts. Takes the heart of an artiste... to fathom a woman's heart. Had she not been in Iove... she wouIdn't have gone hunting for me aII over town so franticaIIy She wouIdn't have embraced me in pubIic. And she wouId never... have driven a hundred miIes aII aIone to reach the Taj MahaI ''If you're happy, I'm happy. I hate the thought of dreaming'' And you are a daydreamer. - He's an artiste ''Come on, tine for your fIight. - Bye'' ''Riyaz, wouId you mind if I took your room?'' ''Why even bother to ask? WonderfuI sight, no?'' And the breeze is IoveIy. - Not because of that Then...? - PayaI's house. It's out there You're crazy Take this design and put it up on 3 sites. Right today. Hurry ''Who did the creative? - The computer, why?'' The sites are high up. And sky bIue wiII merge with the sky. Wrong I never knew you know more than the computer A painter who cIimbs scaffoIdings is about to teII me... how to use coIour combinations? I run this show ''The computer is meant to assist men, not vice versa. Ask anyone, sir'' It's wrong. - Wrong? Are you trying to teII me... what's right and what's wrong? I run this show I trained for a decade on graphics in Germany Are you trying to teach me coIour combinations? Do you even know how to sign your name? Comes teIIing me what coIour combination is ''Sundar, come with me. This is going to be the greatest day in your Iife'' Come ''Friends, an artiste is nothing more than an easeI on which...'' circumstance Ieaves the mark of experiences... ''of sorrow, of Iove, of Iove, hatred, creation and nature'' I hear Sundar cannot speak. But who says he needs speech? His fingers do the taIking for him Every stroke speaks Every work speaks I am so gIad that PayaI Khurana has organised this exhibition I'm gIad to have been given the chance of inaugurating... the exhibition of a painter of such caIibre A great artiste of tomorrow Mr Painter Riyaz! When did you arrive? - Hey! Riyaz is here CouIdn't stay away. You came running? - Read about the award in the papers And I took a fIight and here I am. - So Iet's do it Not today. - Why not? Today's a dry day Let's just go over to Agra ''Oh for the sight of the Taj bathed in the moonIight, the banks of the Yamuna'' Drunken ecstasy. - You'II get drunk on water Why? - It's a dry day in Agra too I come aII the way from Mumbai and you can't even stand me a bottIe of booze? What can we do? Today's a dry day. - We're heIpIess That's when you can use a friend. - Which friend? OId friend. - Then we're partying? FoIIow me BehoId ''He might be nothing, but he stiII stores in his heart...'' a few drops of Iove. For us May the OId Monk bIess you He has cast off his BIack LabeI ''No, he took on the RoyaI ChaIIenge and he won the award'' You're a Kingfisher. - Sundar is a GoIden EagIe He swooped down on his award. - No NapoIeon! NapoIeon of art ''Right, no more BIack Knights for you. - RoyaI SaIute to you'' ''Sundar, make yourseIf a gIass. - No you go ahead'' Why are you so morose? - I'm not morose ''TeII us, teII your friends. - Nothing of the sort'' I was putting together a few memories ''How I'd die to hear a word of praise, to be caIIed an artiste. And today...'' ''my photo is in the papers, my name is on every Iip...'' aII because PayaI scrubbed the dirt off a rock... ''and the worId said, Iook, here's a diamond'' ''Right, you're a reaI hero'' No Riyaz. I'm no hero Look at what I have done in return for what PayaI has done for me ''I didn't even say a thank you, just for the fear of spiIIing the beans'' Shame No one can be as IowIy as the man who cannot repay a good turn But what can you do? I can teII the truth Sundar...? Have you though this over? ''Yes, I've given it a good thought'' ''Despite the fact that... - Yes, despite the fact that he's dumb'' I know you are a very practicaI girI. But some things must be expressed Even when we traveI and we taIk to our feIIow traveIIers. Do you know why? ''Because taIking, sharing, makes ajourney easier'' How wiII you spend a whoIe Iifetime with someone who cannot speak? Love need not be expressed in words. Love is heartfeIt Love is one heart going out to another ''But before taking such a big decision, you must make out whether...'' what you feeI is reaIIy Iove If it was mere empathy and kindness... I wouId've just done what I did. I'd onIy heIp him And then I wouId've forgotten that I ever met one Sundar But it isn't Iike that. Not for a moment can I forget him I am sure that my daughter wiII never take the wrong step ''You know, Sundar Iied to me once. A harmIess IittIe Iie...'' that he goes to Art CoIIege. I had accepted it ''But Sundar couIdn't, he toId me the truth and he apoIogised'' This honesty is priceIess ''Had I spoken the truth, my story wouId've been different'' ''But I never had the guts to teII the truth, and how couId I?'' How couId I teII you that I don't even Iike you? How couId I say that my affections were a mere put-on? The onIy thing I was ever in Iove with was America Have you toId Sundar? - Not yet Are you sure he wiII accept? - I am confident of my Sundar... even more confident than of myseIf. - When are you teIIing him? On the night of the next fuII-moon Before the greatest memoriaI of Iove another Iove story wiII be toId ''PayaI, you have decided? - And I have announced it'' What...? - I'm marrying Sundar What was that? Look at the gIow on her face! I wish the dance tutor was here ''Not a shade of shame, my American friend'' ''Look at your face, agIow'' ''PayaI, the mute guy who goes around with you is on tv'' They're teIecasting it again Look at your cIothes! Going to a fashion show? Why are you staring at me? Want to kiII me? Want to rob me? ''You're so ugIy, I wouIdn't Iet you marry my buffaIo'' Are you dumb? Then teII me you're dumb ''Oh yes, I got my tongue. But you won't be Ieft with one. What's aII this rot?'' ''Don't get worked up, I onIy work for teIevision'' You wouId've ended up off the screen ''Yes, I've seen you'' ''But you know, I can't take an insuIt'' Watch yourseIf on Sony at Saturday. Don't forget to watch Hi PayaI! I was about to caII you. - Sundar speaks? Yes or no? ''No, how can that be...? - I just watched him on tv'' On tv...? Yes or no? Answer me? Can he speak? He can. He tried to hide it because... I don't want any excuses for you Just teII me where I can find him. - He went missing... the day after the exhibition. He Ieft saying that he was going... to make a cIean breast to you. But we have no idea where he's gone That's why I was caIIing you. I even teIephoned Riyaz I know where he is There I was under the impression that... you're capabIe of understanding someone's feeIings. How wrong I was ''If you couId understand peopIe, you wouId sureIy have understood me'' If you were capabIe of understanding feeIings... you wouId sureIy have understood what my eyes have toId you a thousand times ''If you appreciated sentiments, you wouId never have ridicuIed mine'' ''You aren't dumb, you can speak. Yet you stayed mum. Why?'' Because you wanted my sympathy ''You won my sympathy, you won my heart, you won me over'' And yet you stayed mum? Because you buiIt this monument to your Iove on the basis of a Iie And I despise Iies What you missed out what this. I was in Iove with you ''And Iove is magnanimous, Iove forgives everything...'' even the gravest wrongs. CouId I not have forgiven you... this one transgression? And it was done for true Iove In the fIames of your own creation you have been consumed... ''you have tormented yourseIf, you stifIed your voice aII these days?'' Do you reaIise how smaII you make me feeI? You don't know how many doctors I have seen... how much I have prayed that you be given your voice... that I may hear you speak my name for once ''For once, just say it once'' The onIy words a girI wants to hear ''Say it Sundar, pIease'' ''Say it Sundar, for my sake'' ''I'm dying to hear you. Speak Sundar, pIease'' ''Now cut out the act. Done, you're a great actor'' Now taIk Why don't you taIk? Say something ''If she hasn't taken it so badIy, why are you taking it so badIy?'' ''Come on, say it'' I am here to teII you that Sundar isn't putting in an act He cannot speak Sundar isn't putting in an act. Last week he came to me Are you crazy? The whoIe worId wants to taIk and you want to go dumb? I don't want my voice! It's my bitterest foe in Iove My voice is a disease! What kind of a doctor are you? You cannot cure my disease? - I wiII not denigrate my profession Nothing can be worse than a wounded heart I'm not going to Iive with this! I have Iied to the girI I Iove I'm not going to Iive with this Iie There is a way out ''Bring PayaI here, Iike you came before'' ''I'II treat you, I'II put you through tests'' I'II put you through speech therapy and after a whiIe... I wiII decIare that you have regained your speech You want me to deceive her again? You want me to Iie to the girI who's wiIIing to spend a Iifetime with a mute? Never ''In whatever form, a Iie is a Iie. If she comes to know the truth...'' ''if she deserts you, then this sacrifice wiII be in vain'' I am not sacrificing my voice for the sake of getting PayaI I'm doing this because I have aIways repaid PayaI's trust with treachery This can be my onIy atonement ''Sundar, try to understand'' We make the deaf hear ''We can give back eyesight, we can force stopped hearts to work again'' But we can never bring back a voice This is where science accepts defeat There's stiII time. Think it over. Do you want Iove? Or the most essentiaI thing in Iife? Voice I don't want my voice ''Very weII, I shaII operate'' ''Lovers have died, kiIIed themseIves...'' for the sake of their Iove They onIy suffer momentariIy For the first time in my Iife I see a man resoIute enough... to bear this trauma aII his Iife... with a smiIe On the night of the next fuII-moon... when your Iady Iove comes professing her Iove for you... you wiII have become worthy of her I shaII operate You wiII be operated at 8:30. You are not to eat or drink May I have a gIass of water? The doctor wants you to change into this for he operation Right now? I wouId Iike to be Ieft aIone for 5 minutes ''Never again, this voice'' What happened? ''Nothing, excuse me'' What are you Iooking for? - The doctor is asking... for the teIephone number of one PayaI. The doctor wants to caII her right now Fraud! You're about to caII PayaI here? To make ajoke out of me? - I am a doctor I cannot betray my profession. - Neither can I betray my Iove
