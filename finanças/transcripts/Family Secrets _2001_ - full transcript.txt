FAMILY SECRETS Good morning! - What time is it? - Nearly 6:30. - I had this wonderful dream... - Well, you'd better get moving. Gosh, you scared me! - Where are you going? - To do my morning rounds. Hello? Good morning. Asta? - Is that you, Ove? - No, it's your nurse: Mona. - Ove's in the States. - But... Here's your medicine. No, he won't be coming. Please try and wake up a bit. - He told me he was coming today. - He did? - When did he say that? - Yesterday, when we had a phone call. - Today is Friday, isn't it? - Yes, today is Friday. Well, I expect he'll turn up, then. "You feel strong and purposeful, and people are drawn to you." "But beware, great changes are imminent" - "A new friend might be the one he or she appears to be." - Do you believe in that crap? - What of it? Let's read your sign. "You're an ugly jerk who has no friends." - Cut that out! - Why did you give it to him, then? I'll be serious on Monday. Listen up everybody: on Monday there's a ban on cheerfulness. - What a sick family! - Ola! Hi... I saw a crack in the foundation, behind my roses. - I don't think it's a big deal. - It worries me. - Come on, what's going to happen? - Our house could collapse. - Someone should take a look at it. - I'll make some calls. - Promise? - Yes. Well... I guess I've got to go. I'll see you this evening. Toodle-oo! - You are so stupid! - I won't listen to you any more! Go away! Hello! Is Kjell at home? Kjell! Someone's here to see you. Hi... - What do you say? - Nah... - Why not? - I don't feel like it. "The Osprey" "The Society for Young Biologists is a non-profit organization." ..."and field trips in the wild." ..."listen to lectures, discuss issues and go bird-watching." - "protects a pair of ospreys nesting at Närsjöfjärden." "The osprey is an endangered species." HELL! - Hello... - Kjell, come along. - What's this? - Kjell and I are moving. - You can't just barge in here... Yes, I can. I've already talked to the principal. - Come on. - I don't want to... Say good-bye to your classmates. Good morning! Hi there! - Onwards and upwards! - Yes? - Bo? Börje wants to see you at 11. He says it's important. - It's been ages! - It sure has. Would you excuse me? - Hello, Asta, how are you? - I'm not very well. - Have you talked to Ove? - Yes, we said hello. I told him you were coming. Get some rest now, the heart is a serious matter. We might as well admit her to a ward for a few days, just in case. Yes... That's right. I appreciate it. Good bye. - What's the deal? - They'll be here in 20 minutes. - Is it serious? - I don't think so. - She'll be released in a few days. - In a few days? Oh... Well, I won't be here then. You have to figure out your priorities, then. - Call me if you like. - Right, but say... - Can't you stay for coffee? - Sorry, I have to run. - What are you up to? - I'm just clearing up. - All right if I grab some coffee? - Go ahead. I'm really bushed, I hardly got a wink last night. - Why is that? - I don't know... - Is it that bad? - Yeah. Do you know what struck me the other day? What if you never got to fall in love again? That would be so sad... - and I couldn't tell him what was wrong, right? So I told him I missed Dicken, and now we're going to buy a new dog. I'd better be going. - I'll see you tomorrow for dinner. - Right... Bye. - Come on in, Bosse. Coffee? - Sure Gudrun, could you bring us some coffee and Danish, please? Take a seat. - Thank you, Gudrun. - Here you go. - Sugar? Cream? - No, thanks. Black's fine. Right, we've had a few rough years - - but it seems like business is looking up. And on Monday... If we're in luck, they'll place the substantial order we really need... Otherwise we might as well shut down the plant. So, I'd like you to give them the grand tour. You know what to do. I'll do my best. Hey, you know what? In England, there's this band called "The Clash"... Guess what they do. - They piss and shit on stage! - No! Then there's this other band, "The Sex Pistols"... Just guess what they do. - Not in front of everybody? - Of course! There's no point in screwing on stage otherwise. Would you do it in front of an audience? What the hell, why not? - Have you ever? - Screwed for an audience? Maybe I have... It's scary the first time you do it. - But after that, it's a major rush. - Holy shit! But you have to bring your own girl. - Hi! - What are you doing here? - I have the right... - Can't you see we're talking? Go away! Go away! I don't mind having her here. - Mom! - Sorry! I was just going to put some stuff in the freezer. - Why aren't you out playing? - Don't feel like it... Why not? Is anything wrong? Morgan? Kjell is moving down to Skåne. My poor sweetie. Oh, honey! You poor little thing... - The wren. - That was the yellow bunting... Listen... - Could I tag along? - Not on your life! - My friend, Bengan. - That's not true. I don't want you there. Then I'm going to tell Mom and Dad about your shoplifting. How did your report go, Ola? - Did you recruit any new members? - No. - I didn't know you were into birds. - She's not. What about you, Morgan? Anything nice happen to you in school? Kjell is moving away. His parents are getting divorced. Bad news! Well, these things happen... How about Mom... What was your day like? - What's wrong? - Nothing... - You're a million miles away. - I'm just a bit tired. - Have some wine. - No, I'm on call. Again? That's a pity... Can anyone guess what happened to me today? Well... Börje called me into his office. Some Dutch and Belgian buyers will be visiting us next week. He asked me to take care of them. We haven't been doing too hot lately... ...but I just know this will generate a substantial order. If I pull it off, I could be promoted to vice president this autumn. That wouldn't be too bad, now? Wouldn't that be great? Mona? - Wouldn't that be nice? - Sorry... Could you repeat that? Only if you tell me what's on your mind. - It's nothing... - No, we see that something's up. No, I was just thinking... Well, I was just thinking that it might be fun to do something. - Great, what did you have in mind? - Maybe we should move. - Do you want to move? - Yes... Well, I don't know. - Why not? - What do you have in mind? - Do you want to move into town? - No, I thought perhaps... abroad. How about the US? Salt Lake City, where the Osmond Brothers live. It's a lousy place, they have all that air pollution! - Aren't we doing fine here? - A change might do us good. - What's wrong with what we have? - There's nothing wrong with it. I just thought it might be time for a change. If we're fine, why change things? - Are we fine? - Yes! Gosh, we live in a great house that's coming along nicely. And you have your roses. We have... two cars. - And the boat. - Right, don't forget the boat. I've got a good job and we have three great kids. What more can you ask for? Jesus! - You think everything's fine... - Just forget it! - It makes no sense... - It was just a suggestion. I'll get it. Don't worry, if Mom wants to move, she'll have to do it on her own. You can stay here with me. - You can visit her in room 23. - What are you up to, then? - We're having dinner... I was hoping to see you before I leave. What's the point? We don't have anything to say to each other. - Take care! - You too. Bye. What was that all about? I'd better go now. Oh, honey... What's wrong? Honey... Oh, dear! We're not going to move, all right? Nothing's going to change. You know what, let's go buy that denim jacket you wanted tomorrow. Would that cheer you up? - Will it take long? - That depends on how serious it is. Bye. We can't sit here all night. - Anything good on TV? - "The Avengers". Well, hello... - Come in. - I won't stay long. Can I get you anything? Coffee? - and I'll come running like in the old days. Like I've spent the last 20 years waiting for you to return! - That's not the case. - Mona, please... My husband adores me and we have three great kids. I live in a fantastic house with a fabulous garden. My life is perfect. I have everything I ever wanted, and I wouldn't change a thing. Right. - Well, then... - What about you? Why did you come over? Let me know when it starts. I realize that I let you down. Let me down? No, you were a real dickhead. Hey, that was 20 years ago and life goes on, right? I bet you're better off not being married to me anyway. - How can you be so sure? - I don't think it would have worked. You like living here, being married and having kids. - What makes you so sure? - You told me so. There's nothing wrong with that life, it's just not for me. I thought I could do it... ...but as soon as I left I realized... ...that this was the life for me. No... Isn't this just the best, us watching TV together? Isn't it great? - I really enjoy this. - Quiet, the show's starting. - and hit his temple, and there was blood all over the place. I had to send for an ambulance... ...and get him to the emergency room. No, it was awful, I don't want to talk about it. Well, look who's here! The poor man had a head wound and there was blood everywhere. We had to send for an ambulance and get him to the emergency room. I don't feel like talking about it. I'm going to take a shower and go to bed. Mona... Sometimes I feel like... ...like we're drifting apart. - You think so? - Yes... All we talk about are practical matters. I don't know... But I... I miss you. I miss you too. Hi there... Did you call that contractor? Yeah, he'll be coming over tomorrow. - On a Saturday? - Yes. - Do we have to talk about that now? - No, sorry... Honey... Bosse, what is it? - Aren't you in the mood? - No. It's just typical. We haven't had sex since New Year's Eve - - and when we finally get down to it... - Good night. - Listen, I'm sorry... Suit yourself, you airhead! He's here. You can't go dressed like that! You'll freeze to death. - What do you know?! - Suit yourself... Hi! Tell her that she can't go dressed like that. She looks fine to me. - Hi there! This is Katta, she's Ola's sister. Today we're going to go check on our ospreys. In order not to startle them, we'll pair off into smaller groups. At 8:30 we'll meet at the regular place for a snack. You can show them the way. And you can come with me. So, this is it. Welcome! - Can you see anything? - No... Is this better? Where are they? The old pine down by the waterfront. - At the very top. - Now I see them. Aren't they great? You know, there are only 1 ,000 pairs in all of Sweden. Take a good look, this might be your only chance. - Hello! - They flew off. Be quiet! You scared them off. Good morning. - Why have you...? - I just wanted to cheer you up. - Why today? - Because I felt like it. I didn't forget an anniversary, like it's been 20 years since we met? I don't think so. - Why do you have to spoil things? - It was just a simple question. - I just wanted to make you happy. - But I am happy! - Mom? What's wrong? - Nothing. Let's get ready and go shopping. - What about this evening? - What about it? - The stuff we talked about? - Nah, that's off. Give me a call if you change your mind. Hey... - What are you up to this evening? - I have no idea. Hold on... Let's go in and have a look. - What do you think? - Nice! - I don't know if I should buy it. - I think you should. - Really? - Definitely. Could I borrow'your sleeping bag? Biggan asked me to sleep over. - It'll cost you ten kronor. - Five. - 7.50. - All right... - Bloodsucker! - I'll charge you interest after 10. Jeez, this doesn't look good. Bloody hell... - Didn't you have it inspected? - No... Big mistake, you've got a waterway under your house. Are you sure about that? Nobody noticed anything when we put the house up. I bet that was in the summer. But that's not the same now. - Isn't there anything I can do? - Sure... But it won't be cheap. - What are we talking about? - You'll have to drain the lot. Then you have to pour a new foundation. What happens if I don't do anything about it? One fine day it will bloody well fall apart. Boom, boom, boom... - What's the matter? - Something just occurred to me. - Can I come along? - No, you'd better guard our stuff. I'll be right back. Hi. About what you said yesterday, I'm not mad at you. If the tables were turned, I probably would have done the same thing. I just wanted you to know... ..that I like you. Well, that's all I... - Will I see you again? - Sure, I'll call you. Let's go home and make pancakes. - What did the contractor say? - That our house will fall down. - What? - I'm joking. Just add a little more mortar. - Ola and Katta, come and eat. - How are you doing today, Morgan? We found some great sneakers and a terrific denim jacket. - Right? - Whose turn is it? Morgan's? - I don't want any. - You've hardly touched your food. - I'm not hungry. What about you, Mom? Didn't you find anything? Oh, I found a dress for tonight. - Don't you want to see them? - They're so full of crap. - Isn't it a bit late to back out? - You're right. I'm sure we'll have a great time. Look, may I sleep over at Biggan's house tonight? - Sure, but why? - Her Mom's gone to Åland. - Ola will be here with Morgan. - I was planning to go to a party! You're a big boy, Morgan. - You don't mind being home alone. - May I be excused? - But you're not finished. - I feel sick to my stomach. Go have a rest, you can eat later if you're hungry. - What's up with him? - Too much candy, I suppose. - What are you doing? - Nothing... Do you want to play? - Hi. So, you're sitting here. - Yeah. Hey, Dad... Have you ever felt despair? Despair? Nah... Despair of 'dat pair, it's all the same to me. - Maria! - I've got to go home for dinner. - You know what fucking sounds like? - No. - Sort of like monkeys... - So what? - Wait! - Let go! - Why not? - Because I don't want to. - Please, it won't take long. - Maria! - Sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you! - Daddy! Daddy! Where did he go? Where the hell is he? I'll kill that little creep! - Where did he go? - I don't know. - Where does he live? - In that white house over there. - Do you recognize this bike? - Yes. - What's the matter? - Your son, that's what! Presumably, he bothered our daughter ... I don't understand... Damn that kid! Why don't you answer me? Answer me... Your mom wanted me to talk to you. You see, some people came looking for you. Maria's dad. He said you had done a bad thing to her. Is that true? Had you? Tell me... Are you and Mom getting divorced? What put that in your head? Where on earth did you get that idea? Is that what made...? Son, your mom and l are not getting divorced. Hi, it's me. - Why not? - I can't go into detail. But things are pretty complicated at home. Hello? And then he says: "Are you and Mom getting a divorce?" And I went: "Is that what's been bothering you, son?" And it was. So he asked me to promise it wasn't so. And I said: "We're not getting divorced, we love each other." - I don't want to go out tonight. - So now you don't want to go? - You weren't so thrilled yourself. - But then you wanted to go. Can't we just say that Morgan doesn't want to be all alone? I'll wait downstairs. Some Cheez Doodles? Would you like some Cheez Doodles? Listen... We can stay home if you like. He can handle it! It's all set. Come on, Mom. Call if you need anything. The number's in the book. - Bye-bye - Bye, son. - Maybe I should... - Remove the wrapper. What's up? You have that fresh-out-of-bed look. I do? Don't, you'll embarrass him! Nice dress. So you're hitting the booze. Pour me one. I thought you were going to a party. I'm feeling kind of out of it. What's the matter, Morgan? - Is anything wrong? - No... - You want to do something? - Like what? Come on! - It was obvious they would split up. - We could hear them yelling. - But I do feel sorry for the boy. - It's always hardest on the kids. Anders said she came to school and picked him up during class. - No! - It's true. - Pass the butter, please. - That's terrible! - Well, she's always been a bit odd. - What do you mean? She wanders around in her robe all day long. I call them as I see them. And it wouldn't surprise me if she had a lover. - What makes you say that? - I don't have proof... - But I bet it's true. - I would, with a husband like that! I was just kidding, honey! - Cheers! This is it. Hold it open. Guess who I ran into? Ove Skoog, of all people. - Who the hell is Ove Skoog? - The guy with the Elvis hairdo. - Oh, that guy... - He was an odd-ball. - He was very good-looking. - I agree. - Mona, didn't you date him? - Oh, that was ages ago... - Where did you run into him? - He was filling out a prescription. His mother is seriously ill, that's why he is in Sweden on a short trip. - You must have run into him too. - Of course. Well, she didn't tell me! - Does he still live in the States? - Yes, on the outskirts of Boston. What does he do there, chase women? No, he runs a small hotel. That's what he told me. Well, I own hotels... in Monopoly! I think you're full of crap. You don't know what you're talking about. You're green with envy. To hell with you! - What's your problem? - They are so narrow-minded! I'm leaving, are you coming with me? Mona's not quite well... She's been working too hard lately, I think she's overdone it. Thank you very much for a lovely evening. - I hope we haven't spoiled things? - These things happen... Well then... Toodle-oo! Start spinning it when I say go. Go! Faster! Mona! What's up with you? That's the problem, you just don't have a clue. - What don't I have a clue about? - Life! You don't have a clue! You think happiness is having a house, cars and kids! But I'm not happy, and I don't think you are either. And I don't... Let me be! This isn't what I want in life. I thought I did, but I don't. This is not about you or the kids, I love you with all my heart. But I feel like I'm missing out on something. I have to figure it what it is, or my life will be pointless. That's why I'm leaving you now. Cool, isn't it? "Eeny, meany, miney, moe"... - What are we going to do? - You'll see. "If he hollers make him pay"... Katta! - I don't want to. - Of course you do. - Haven't you ever fucked before? - Yes, I have... Well, what's the fuss then? Come on... - Where are you going to go? - I don't know... I'll call you. - Are you going to him? - No, I'm not. What about things here at home? The kids? Me? You'll manage. Mona, please... - Let's just calm down. - Let go of the car! Mona, please! Go, Bengan! Take my sweater off. Hey, little guy. - Are you still up? - Yes. Where was Mom going? They needed her there. She's on call. She had to go into town. Go to bed... Mom will be here in the morning. Good night. I thought I heard something. My goodness, what's the matter? - Open the door! - Leave me alone. Give me my sleeping bag back, or pay interest. - Open up! - Take your damn sleeping bag! What have you done to it? It's completely... Where's the cover? The cover for the sleeping bag! - How should I know? - Well, you were the one using it! Did you leave it at Biggan's house? - How do you know it's not there? - I wasn't there. I partied with your fucking buddies last night! That bastard! Well, there are only 1,000 pairs in all of Sweden, you know... So their having chicks is a pretty big deal. This won't do, Bosse! You've got to pull yourself together. Let's see... Look at that... If we put them here, we'll know where they are. Actually, I have no idea. I really don't know. Now that I could do whatever I please... I don't have the faintest idea what to do. - I hope I didn't... - What? - That I didn't cause all this. - No. Goodness, no. We're going to fix this. - What do you want? - I think Dad is losing his mind. Take it easy now... Damn it! What the hell are you looking at, you fucking losers?! Take it easy, Dad. - What's wrong with you?! - I don't know. I just don't know... I don't know! You're the greatest... Let Daddy get some sleep, and he'll be just fine. Find anything interesting? Could you do me a favor and just hold me? A, A, A It's a w'onderful day, day, day... A, A, A... We're starting today, today, today! So say hooray, hooray, hooray The letter is A, A, A! Hello, w'elcome to the letter A. Isn't it a beauty? It's a big teepee w'ith a bar in the middle... How are you, Dad? ...much better, thanks. Onwards and upwards! - Did the world change color? - Was it like a sneeze? - Tell us what it was like. - I can't! Open your books to page 10. - Ola can start reading. "This means the truth may cause a great deal of commotion." "It's no coincidence an indiscreet man is called a menace to society." - They're here. - Who? Right... I'll be out in a moment. Oh, shit... Come on, Bosse! I hope I haven't caused you any trouble. - What do you mean? - Well... - I have no idea what you expected... - I didn't expect anything. - So you're not upset that l...? - No, I knew you would. - What? - It's just the way you are. There's nothing wrong with it. - Don't you have school today? - I'm playing hooky. Then you haven't been able to show off your new jacket. I'm on my way home, you want to join me? Mom! Oh my God! What's he up to? Subtitle Preparing for DVD: Satellittext AB Stockholm
