♪ Opening Song So, what's this one called? You know, I'm not sure. Any suggestions? Wow, this one actually smells really good. Gee, thanks. Well, you did have the one that smelled like fish. There wasn't even any fish in it. You guys trying out lotions? Mmm hmm. Don't make Margarett throw up again. No, this one actually smells really good. Mmm, that's actually better than the pineapple one you had a while ago. See, I'm improving. Did you take your medicine today? - Yes. - Yes. I already have one mom. Girls, your father's here with the cake. CAKE! I can't believe I finally finished. I know it's about time. Hey we can't all graduate in four years. Oh, John's here! Elinor? Yeah? I heard the Porter account came through. Yes, just yesterday. Good job. That's a huge client for us. Thank you. I know. - John, welcome - Hi. So what do you think? You're in the presence of a remarkable woman. Poised to take on the world of... um? English. After all those semesters that's what you ended up with. Dad! Just kidding. That's not funny. Well, I'm proud of you. Thank you. Mmhm. Thank you. John when do you leave for Switzerland? Uh, in a few months. The beginning of next fall. Thanks again for opening the door for me with that company. Happy to. So far away, though. What are you going to do without Marianne? Well, we won't be apart for very long. Um, this sounds like this is getting really serious. It is. Apparently the job that dad got him is going to put him ahead like 10 years. Wow! I mean I'm gonna miss him but... You never know what may happen before he leaves. Well, take it slowly. I mean, you don't know him that well. Trust your heart. That's what I always say. Oh right 'cause the heart is never wrong. When did you get so practical? Is it because you haven't had a boyfriend in two years? Okay. I know for you that would be like a biblical drought. How many boyfriends have you had in the last two years? It's not about quantity, it's about quality. Well, at least we agree on that. Mmm hmm Oh, I'll get it. Hi. Can I help you? Special Agent Wayne. Is Henry Dashwood here? Uh, is there a problem? Elinor. Henry Dashwood we have a warrant for your arrest. What? You have to come with us now. Daddy. It will be okay. Daddy. What's happening? Call our attorney! Henry? Dad? You have the right to remain silent. What's going on? I don't know. Your husband is accused of fraud. What's commonly known as a ponzi scheme. What does that mean? Well, basically it's when a person takes an investor's money, promises a big return and is paid with other investors' money, but in reality most of the money is pocketed illegally by whoever is running the scheme. My husband would never do that. Well, I will defend the best I can but the government's case... If they win Mr. Dashwood would owe a lot of money. The authorities have a list of a couple hundred investors. So, what comes next? Well, they have a search warrant to search your home and they'll take any evidence with them. The government will also seize any valuables such as cars, art, jewelry, any and all assets in Henry's name. His accounts have already been frozen, so there will be no access to any of his money. But what about the house? What about my home? Well, remember he hasn't been convicted. If Henry is found guilty they'll most likely auction it off, but for the time being they'll put a lien on it. Do you think he's guilty? Well, what I think is irrelevant, but the authorities seem to be building a good case. I'll do everything I can. So, what's the worst case scenario? If convicted, major prison time. The family seems subdued today for the sentencing of Henry Dashwood. Convicted of securities fraud, money laundering, and several other federal charges, Dashwood was sentenced to a maximum 75 years in prison. Mom.. Please turn that off. We have enough to worry about. But your father, we have to appeal this. We don't have any money. If dad hadn't prepaid our rent then Marianne and I would be out in the street. I cannot believe he did this. I know, but there's evidence that he did. Guess what? We made the front page of the tabloids. Oh as if that's something to be proud of. Uh, I look pale. Oh please, we're famous. No, stop it. You guys throw that out. You know those papers exaggerate. What are we going to do? Marianne and I are going to get jobs and we're going to pay our own way. We are? Yes. Well, what about Margarett? Her medicine is more than $3000 a month. Plus doctor visits. Before that was nothing, but now? Okay but don't we have health insurance? That's with health insurance. We've lost everything. I am not going to lose Margarett too. No, mom, we will get her enough of the medicine. I mean, do you think we can make enough? Well, your aunt Charlotte has offered a place for me to stay, and so if I work in her shop, I may be able to bring in a third of what we need. Okay. Alright. Well, Marianne and I will just make up the rest. I mean all we need are jobs. Yeah, this looks promising. Hi, I am calling about the job listing. Okay, thank you. It's already been filled. Ohhh. ♪♪♪ Yes, I will see you in Paris. Thank you. Sorry to keep you waiting. No problem. Name is Dashwood, correct? Oh please, call me Elinor. Dashwood, where have I heard that name before? I'm concerned your work experience is insufficient for the required qualifications. Um, but I have worked extensively with- Good luck to you. Hi! I'm calling about the executive assistant position. Okay, thanks. Elinor... I'm sorry to waste your time but we have decided to hire from within. Yeah, hi. Is the clerical job still available? Work experience? Um, none. Dashwood. Hmm, I, I don't know if you're the best suited for this job. But you haven't asked me a single question. I just, I don't think you fit into the culture we have here at the office. Sorry. Hey. Uhh... You calling about a job? If you're calling about the file clerk job, it has been filled. For all other inquiries please press 0. Uhh, and the ones that aren't filled, you need more work experience. This is way harder than I thought. If it makes you feel any better, having work experience doesn't help either. Everybody takes one look at Dashwood Investments and promptly kicks me out the door. I'm sorry. I mean there are jobs out there. They're just not quite as glamorous as I'd hoped. Okay, this is a job. This is a job. This is a job. I am getting paid for this job. I'm dancing with my banana. Helloo. Hey nice coconuts. Oh, thank you sir, thank you. Oh my goodness. Hello, it's my money time. Hello. AAAHHH! AAAHHH! OHHHH NOOOOO! Ugh, who knew this would be so hard? That costume stunk, too. I can't believe you got fired. I know. How was I supposed to know that the sprinklers were going to go off and that the suit couldn't get wet. I didn't know. Well that's why it smelled. It's never been washed. Can it get any worse? I don't think so. I just got fired from a job where I wore a gigantic gorilla costume and waved a banana at cars passing by. I... Just wait here a moment Okay. I don't think she's for us. Why not? Recognize her? Uh, so. She's cleaning. How hard is that? I don't want the customers to be uncomfortable thinking that she might steal from them. She'll be out of sight and she's got to be pretty desperate. Alright. We'll give her a chance, but you keep your eye on her. Hi. Hi. Any luck? I don't know if you call it luck but I got a job. I am now the new custodial technician at the spa on Main Street. Custodial Technician? Janitor. Sounds lovely. Yeah, but I think it's going to be enough to cover our expenses. I'm just worried about Margarett's medicine. Well, my options were fast food, which pays nothing, or a grocery bagger that pays even less. I was really starting to give up, but I checked the internet one more time and you are now looking at the new copy assistant to a marketing firm. You're kidding! That's amazing. How did you do that? Well, I think you'd do great here. Can you start Monday, Ms. Webb? I think he thought I was cute. Wait, so are there any other jobs available? No, but um, I should be bringing in enough to cover us. Okay, well, we still need to be frugal. Yeah, how am I going to get to work? Ugh, the bus is stinky and always running late. We need a car. Well, I could actually walk to the spa from here, but a car would come in handy. I'll start looking for something cheap. Something nice. Of course. Alright, well, I gotta get ready I'm going to dinner with John. John? I haven't heard about him in a while. I think he was worried about the job that dad got him, but he sounded happy so it must still be going through. Good. Have fun. Thanks! Ai yie yie. How are we going to be able to afford a car? Have you heard from your dad recently? Um, my mom's talked to him. She fills us in. Hmm. It's been really hard on everybody. I mean my poor mom she just didn't see that coming at all. She could really use some good news right about now. Well, I have some. Really? The Switzerland job. I thought they were going to dump me after your dad was arrested, but they're flying me out to start the job. That's great! Yeah, I'm going out there to get trained, start workin', and I will get to explore Switzerland. So, when do you leave? This week. Ohh, and any idea on when you're going to return? I don't know. I mean, no exact dates yet, but the plan is to get started, and then transfer me to one of the offices here in the US. Oh, good. Hey, I'll miss you. I'll miss you, too. I'll call you every day. Guess what? I got us a car, actually it's a truck. What happened to our TV? Yes, I had to pay for the truck, somehow. Listen, it's not what we're used to, but, it's going to get us from a to b. Come look, come. You're gonna love this. Come on. Well, it can get us from point a to point b, but can it get us back to point a? My friend gave me a great deal 'cause her dad doesn't need it anymore. I already miss the flat screen. No, need. I got us a replacement. This keeps getting better and better. Doesn't it? So what happened on your date last night? Nothing. Well, something. The job came through in Switzerland. Oh good. He leaves right away. Oh bad. Well, do you wanna take it for a spin? Honestly, no. Yeah. All right so here's where we keep all of the fresh linens. We have sheets here, towels here. Everything's organized by size so it's face, hand, and body. Got it. Um so, each customer's going to get a set in their locker when they come in and so you need to refill the lockers as each customer leaves. Also, put extra towels in each treatment room. Okay, I think I can handle that. Okay good, ummm and your uniform. Uniform? Yeah. Great. How's the work going? Oh, it's fine. Uh, the bathrooms need a deep cleaning so you can stay late one night this week and do that. No problem. I'm Hannah the office manager. I'm not going to sugar coat it. You've got a lot of work ahead of you. We come up with marketing campaigns for tons of accounts. People will come to you throughout the day with presentations, contracts, whatever to copy. And this will be your domain. Good luck with the machines, but don't sweat it if you go through a few reams of paper trying to figure it out. Just be sure to log in the copy job with what client it goes for. That way we can bill them. Okay. Big talker aren't ya? Well, I was just wondering... I'm at extension 377 if you get in a panic. Hi! Oh, you're new here aren't you? Yes. I hope you can do this. I need 50 copies collated, 3 whole punched and bound. Okay, don't use those coil things. Brads or brackets will be fine. I will be back in a half an hour. Okay. Brads, brackets. Okay. This goes there. Uh, yeah, well that was easy. Ugh, Come on. What did I do? What is with you? Don't stress. It's just a jam. Thank you. I'm Brandon. You must be the new copy girl. Yes, Marianne Da--, Marianne um Webb. I just need a copy Okay, um. I got it. Wow, that was... easy. I think the user manual's on that shelf. Really? Thank you! Good luck. Hey. My hands are killing me. Mmm, I'm sorry. Mmm hmm. Oh, you wanna use some of my lotion? Yeah, thanks. Mmmm, I forgot how good this one smells. Hey I've come a long way. Remember when I used to make those concoctions out of clovers? Oh yeah, how could I forget that? Wow this already makes my hands feel better. Really? Yeah, I'm not even just sayin' that to be nice. Can I keep this bottle? Yeah, go for it. How was your day? It was stressful. I mean who would have thought making copies could be so difficult? What are you watching? I have no idea. The reception on this thing is terrible. Well with all that tinfoil on the antenna I bet you we could pick up a talk show from Mars. We good? Okay. Hey. I was just looking for you. Oh. Um, can you put together five packets from the file on this drive? Oh. Uh, okay, when do you need it by? Um, after lunch. Is that enough time? Sure. Great. Be careful dear. My arthritis is acting up so my feet are awfully tender. Oh, ok. Uh, excuse me. Sorry I couldn't help but overhear. Try this. What is it? It's a lotion my sister makes. Okay. Ohhh that scent. What is that ambrosia? Uh, I don't know. It's fruit, flowers, I'm not sure. Mmm. Very refreshing. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay. Let's see. Alright. Okay. Print to copier. Huh. Uh, I T apostrophe S. It's a contraction. Yeah, no, that is the amount. Okay, bye. Hey, Hannah, um, I noticed a type-o on one of the copies. Print it anyway. Are you sure? It's pretty obvious. Our people know what they are doing. It might be a play on words. Yeah, I'm just going to ask Brandon. Double check. It's for Brandon? Definitely. Just print it. He's senior management. I'm just trying to help. I know you think you are but your job is simple: copy, staple, hole punch. Don't overstep. Ooohhh, my feet. Was there something wrong with your pedicure? Oh no. I feel like I'm 20 again. This dear girl gave me some lotion. It's really easing the pain. Oh? Well, that's good. Do you know where I could find her? The girl who was gathering the towels. That girl? Oh miss, miss. Oh hi. How are your feet? Oh, they feel better then they have in years. I'm wondering if you have any more of that magic lotion? Oh and Betty, she has terrible backaches because of her mattress and her husband's too cheap to replace it. He always says what's not broke don't fix it, but he's just a tight wad. I think this lotion is just what she needs. But I, I don't make it my sister does but- Oh honey to feel like this, I am willing to pay for her time and ingredients. You talk to your sister and let me know next week. Okay, I will. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Sorry. Just don't let it interfere with your work. Got it. Hey. Hey. What are you doing? Saving money. Are you washing those? Hey, whatever cuts costs. Alright, alright. So, mom called. Oh, how is she doing? She's been better. She is gonna send Margarett to visit us. Is everything okay? Yeah, I think so. I think she's just having a hard time at school, just kids. Poor thing. Like she doesn't have enough to worry about. Yeah. Where you goin'? Oh, I'm gonna go back to the spa. I'm gonna pick up some extra hours, so don't wait up. I won't. Oh hey, uh, can I get a couple more bottles of that lotion? I just gave you a full bottle. I know but there's this customer there who loves it. She wants to buy some. Really? Okay. Okay. Bye. Bye. Yeah, I'm here. Yes, I'll get it. Okay. I've been workin' in the bathroom all the... ...bathroom just to make the tiles shine white, ba boom ba boom ba boom. Can't you hear my alarm clock goin' off. It's gonna go off so early in the morn.. Wuh wuh wuh. Can't you hear Fran sayin', please Elinor scrub the floor! Elinor clean the floor. What? Elinor clean the floor. Who? Elinor clean the floor. Please clean. OH MY GOSH! Uh, it's okay. I'm a lawyer. How, how does the fact that you are a lawyer make me feel better? I just stopped by to pick up some stuff from Fran's office. Oh. And you are? Yeah, I'm the uh new custodian. I didn't think there was anyone here. It's okay. It's not everyday I get a live concert. Yes, yes well you know I was just trying to prepare for my, my career in reality television. Mmm hmm. Yeah, I thought I would start with uh singing and then I would move onto dance and then you know the survival one I wanted to try and and maybe the one where I can choose my own husband would be good. I'd vote for ya. Elinor? Uh yeah. Um I should go back to work here. I'm trying to impress my boss. I could put in a good word for ya. Oh no no that's okay. I'm, I need to earn my reputation. Um, hey maybe we could keep the singing thing between just you and me. Yeah, of course. Um but only until you're on TV 'cause after that I make no promises. Ooohhh that was awesome. Fran? In here. My sister cooking. I took a look at everything. What do you think? I think you have to make some decisions. The spa can only bring in so much. You owe a lot of money. Yes, thank you for stating the obvious. I don't suppose anybody owes you money? I did loan Lucy a twenty. How did you get into so much debt? Oh you know start up costs, bills, blaahh. Maybe it's time to give it up. Shut down the spa? No. You could move. Maybe some place cheaper. Change your lifestyle. Not an option. Fran! I'm just trying to help. You're losing more money every month. Getting second, third, fourth notices of default on your loans. What if I got another loan to float the others? That's just gonna make it worse. I mean how long before they threaten to take everything away? Have they already threatened that? I'll figure something out. Fine. Oh, hey I was surprised to find someone working so late at the spa. She was cleaning the locker room. Oh, that's Elinor. She didn't give you any trouble did she? No, not at all. She been working for you long? No, our janitor just quit. Why all the interest? Not interest, curiosity. Her father is that fraud, Dashwood. Ugh, I mean she's just a janitor so I agreed to let her work for me but, woo. How gracious of you. Go go get on the left I got the guy on the right. Shoot, shoot. Oh yeah! Guys, hold on a second. Hi. Hi. I didn't wake you, did I? What time is it there? Uh, it's it's ten. Ten? I thought you guys were nine hours ahead. Yeah, uh, I must have set my watch wrong. You poor thing. So, how's it going? Good. It's good. Everything's very Swiss. How so? Uh, there's holey cheese everywhere and, uh, yeah it tastes a lot better than the stuff we have here, there. And, um, how's work going? It's great. It's great but it uh would be a lot better if we were together. Well, you better hurry up and impress them so you can come home. I'll do my best. Uh look I gotta go can I call you later? All right. I miss you. All right, you too. All right guys I'm back. Ah, come on. You completely embarrassed me. What? There's an error in this. I presented this last night to our CEO and a client that would have been worth five million dollars to this company. I was just told to copy it. Typical. Just do the bare minimum, right? Just enough to get by. Never thinking. I saw the mistake. I took it to my boss and she told me that you would know what you're doing. Wait, you saw this and you let it go? Well, why didn't you see it. Had I seen it, I would have fixed it! Don't blame me because you don't take pride in your work. You know this is what I get. This is what I get for expecting a copy girl to understand. Just go ahead and have a seat, your pedicurist will be right with you. Oh thank you. Oh Elinor, uh, wash the bowl first and then the step. Thank you. Anything to make you go faster. Excuse me. Yes, ma'am? No, I meant her. Are you the one that makes that special lotion? Oh yeah, that's me. Well, it's actually my sister. Oh, Mrs. Jennings could not stop talking about it. She's the biggest gossip, but when I heard I figured I need to try some. Do you have a bottle I can buy? I do. I do, you know it's actually for Mrs. Jennings, but I don't think she comes in until the end of this week. Oh, I'd love it. Okay, I'll go get you one. Thank you. Anything wrong? Elinor's selling lotion. Yeah, a customer came in earlier asking about that today. Let me know if any other people are looking for it? Are you going to stop her from selling it? No. Not yet. Well if it isn't the midnight idol. Oh yes, just one of my many secret identities. Mind if I sit? No, please. You on a break from work? Yeah, the brownies here are amazing. I've never tried 'em. We weren't properly introduced the other night, Edward Farris. Elinor Dashwood. Farris? You're not by any chance related to- Yeah, Fran is my sister. Oohh. Yeah, don't fault me for that. Well, I won't hold your relatives against you if you don't hold mine against me. Oh, that's right. The investment guy. Yeah. So, what're you doing? I'm, um, I'm actually trying to make ends meet. Looks intense. Yeah, it's amazing the things you just can't do without. Like that brownie. And groceries, and medicine. Medicine? Um, not for me, for my little sister. Oh, what's wrong with her? Um, she has a type of leukemia. It's treatable but the medicine is really expensive. Yeah, money's heartless that way. You know take us lawyers. Without a good one your life could be destroyed. Lawyers and doctors. What kind of law do you practice? Patent law, mostly with corporations and stuff. Ahh. Yeah, that doesn't make me any more likeable does it? Well, I'll see if I can maybe overlook it. Good. Hey. Hey, dinner's almost ready. Macaroni and cheese? It's a budget meal. Elinor, you and your budget meals. Are you okay? Yeah I just, uh, I had a bad day at work. Already? Mmm hmm. I don't really want to talk about it though. Are you sure? Yeah, I just left John this whole long voicemail about it so. Okay, so I've been going over our budget... Ugh. No, it's good news and bad news, but the good news is we have enough to cover our expenses. The bad news is we're way short on Margarett's. Do we really need to talk about this right now? I have an idea. Okay what? Your lotion. What about it? It does something to people and the smell is amazing. So, I don't know if it's the scent that just makes people feel better or if there's actually something in the lotion, but those bottles you gave me the other day, they're gone and not to the people they were intended for. Really? Do you think we can make more? Yeah, sure. I, um, just gonna need some extra ingredients. Let's see calendula, and passion flowers, cream, fruit. You should buy it in bulk. Are you feeling okay? Yes. Okay, are you sure that we can make this back? I mean, I'm gonna raise the price so yeah. I get to go shopping! Just for the ingredients. Okay, all right. I'm on it. Kay! You can have the mac and cheese without me. Thanks. Hi. Hi. Um, I came by to apologize. I was upset yesterday, obviously, but even without the typo my proposal wasn't what the client wanted. But, what you said about me not taking pride in my work, you're wrong. I do take pride in my work, I take too much actually. That's why, uh, that's why this is a little hard for me to swallow. Okay. Hmm. Thanks for your understanding. Here you go. Ooh, I can't tell you how excited I am about this. Well, good. I hope you enjoy it. Oh I will and I've been telling everybody about it. I'd buy them all a bottle but nobody ever pays me back. Oohh. Uh, it's wonderful. Have you smelled this? That is good. What is that? Lilac? Uh, I don't know flowers, and this and that. Well, I am off ladies. Goodbye. Goodnight. I have never seen her that happy. Good. So listen I am taking off. There's a bunch of towels in the dryer. They're going to be done in like 45 minutes and I'm gonna fold them tomorrow morning. Okay, great. Edward! Hey. How are you? Starving. Have you eaten? No. Of course not you just got off work. Do you want to join me? Yeah, that'd be great. Awesome. Thanks. Of course. I am not ignoring the letters. I understand that you can take everything. That's what will happen if you don't make a payment by the end of the month. I- Thank you. Edward didn't come inside? Apparently not. He just picked up Elinor. I need you to get something out of Elinor's locker. What? A bottle of that lotion. You want me to break into her locker? Yes, is that a problem? No, she just sold some today, though, so I don't think she has any left. Well, then you wait until she brings some more in and then she won't notice there's any missing. Okay, but you have to set me up with Edward. Done. Yeah, this probably isn't what you had in mind when I mentioned dinner. No, this is perfect. Thank you. My pleasure. I didn't think a place like this was your style. Well, I wasn't always a lawyer. This is, uh, kind of reminds me of growing up. Growing up I went to garden parties and golf tournaments, but this feels more real. I like it. Good, 'cause ladies first. Uh-oh. Yeah. I don't think this is going to go very well. Well, we'll see. Kay, uh uh uh. Mmm hmm., interesting. Oohh, that wasn't- All right. - Great was it? Um, no no. All right let me show you a better way okay? Yep. Okay, step up to the line. Okay. Hold the ball about here. Yes. And then as you let the ball come back step forward and then release. I mean isn't that what I did basically? Uh no. So aside from being new to bowling, tell me about yourself. Oh, you don't really want to hear about the investment manager turned custodian. No, no. Skip the dirty laundry. I don't know if it's that easy. You know we get a lot of letters from investors, angry, distraught, letters. It was a lot of money. Sometimes I hate my dad for what he did but I love him. Sounds confusing. Yeah, sometimes I wish I could go back in time. My life was nearly perfect. Nearly? You had garden parties. Woo! That was amazing. Yeah, that was okay. Then again, you know, if nothing every changed I'd still unknowingly be helping my dad steal from people, and I would never have learned how to bowl. Speaking of, your turn. Look out. I'll be watching. 'Kay. All right. Oh oh oh. Good form, good. Thank you. Mmm hmm. Don't talk, you'll mess me up. Okay. Huh. Ugh. Ohhhh. All right. Yeah. Um, can I help? Yes. 'Kay. All right hold this. Put your fingers in there. Done. Good. Okay step up to the line here. This line? Yes, very good. So you want to center up on that. Good. 'Kay, and then hold the ball up to about where your chin is and then step forward as you bring the ball back. I'm scared. Good. Now you're all right just don't drop it on my foot. Aaahhh! Oh, you did it! OH! Wow. Thank you for your help. Anytime. Oh. Um, it's my phone Mmm. Hello. Right now? No that's fine. Totally, of course. Okay bye. You okay? Yeah, um, my sister is visiting. Tonight. Oh, uh, I'll take you home. Is that okay? Yeah, yeah. This was really fun though. Yeah, no, um, I'll tell you what. Promise me a re-match to show off what you've learned and we'll call it even. It's a deal. Hi! Hey. Hey. Margarett is going to sleep over. Fun! Yeah, we are hard at work making some more Soothing Scents. Ooh, I wanna scrub in. Okay, water's boiling so we cannot skip this very important step. So, why do you have to boil it? Oh trust me you want to, otherwise, your skin itches. So, what are you guys making? We're trying something new. It's called 'Elinor's Love Potion Lotion'. Designed to do what? Oh, get you a date. Okay. I was just on a date, I think, when you called. Seriously? You think? Well, details. There aren't any details yet. Maybe on the next date. I said I would take the couch. She had so much fun tonight. You wanna know what she asked me while you were gone? What? She wanted to know if dad stole all that money to help pay for the medical bills and medicine. Dad siphoned away more money then we could ever need for medicine or anything else. I know. That's what I told her. We're gonna make it through this. Marianne we are. Uhh, it's John. Okay. Hi. Hey, it's me. I know. I just wanted to call you and wish you goodnight. Oh, that's really sweet. Hey, where are you? It sounds kind of loud. Uh, about to go in a meeting. The conference room here overlooks these beautiful snowy mountains. That sounds amazing. So, you can't talk for too long? No, I'm afraid not but I was just thinking about you and had to talk to you before you went to sleep. Well, I'm really glad you did. Sweet dreams. Sweet dreams whenever it's night time in Switzerland. Bye. Bye. John, how are you man? Starving. Her name's Patrice. Her father owns five restaurant chains across the country and she's the one that inherits them all. I can't wait to meet her. Hey, did you need something? What? No. Okay. I was gonna go grab an early lunch. Good. Do you wanna come? Uh, sure. Great. You wanted to see me? Yes, the toilet is backed up in the men's locker room and I need you to deal with that and quickly before any clients notice. Okay. Also, the tub in the couple's room needs to be scrubbed. Check that drain for any clogs. We have a client booked for treatment room 5 and she's allergic to all sorts of laundry soaps so what you're going to have to do is take a set of sheets and hand wash them with baking soda. Use the scrub brush. Be very thorough. Okay. Oh and our client scheduled for room 2 has requested satin sheets, she'll be here at noon. Okay. ♪ OH! Ugh Uh. Oh. OH OH! Whoo. Oh no, did uh Fran say room 2 it's room 4. Uh, if you hurry you can just make it before the client gets here though and be sure to put the regular sheets back on that bed. Excuse me. Yeah. Can I help you? Uh, I'm looking for a certain lotion to buy. Oh. My aunt has been talking about it. Oh yeah, yeah. I'll get ya one. Just one second. Thank you. Hey Big Al, the special please. Um, I'll have one too. I got it. Oh, thank you. Thanks. You're welcome. Mmm. It's better than I thought. So, do you come out here a lot? To the park? Mmm hmm. A lot more relaxing than a break room. Mmm. Well it's all the flowers. Do you know that there are 35 different kinds of flowers in this park? Is that a lot? Yeah, can you name even ten different types of flowers? Red roses. Okay. White roses. Mmm hmm. Yeah, I can't. No you can't. I can't. Exactly. It's hard. How did you know that? Flowers are my thing. So, what brought you to the copy room and not a greenhouse? I mean a girl like you seems like she could get a job anywhere. I tried, but I don't really have much work experience. Now my sister, she could run circles around me. What does she do? Um, she recently got downsized so she works at a spa. Well, if you like I could, you know, ask around HR, see if there's any positions opened up. That's okay. I think she's warming up to it. Edward, wow, um, what brings you here? Just visiting Elinor. Really? Yeah. She's working. Didn't you guys just close? She does all the behind the scenes things. Besides, I think you could do a lot better... Edward? Hey! Are you done working? Yes. Excellent. How does Indian food sound? Indian food how delicious. I'm getting hungry myself. Lucy? That sounds delicious. Yes. 'Kay, well I should probably get going. It's been a long day. Do, do you wanna ride? No, I'm okay thanks. Well, shall we? Yeah. What happened? I don't know. It just died. It barely made it home. Now it won't start. Okay, pop the hood. Let me take a look. Okay. Is that it? Yeah. I think so. So, how was your day? Ugh. I don't know how much longer I can stay working at the spa. Any jobs opened up at your office? No, not really. Hey I had lunch with a coworker today. Guy or girl? Guy. Oh, naturally my next question is, is he cute? Uh, I don't know I mean, I guess. Is he like John cute? Huh, I don't know. Besides it doesn't matter. John and I are together and Brandon he's just like way too serious. Oh, and the mature thing isn't really for you. Hey! Ha ha ha Okay try it again. Let's see. All right. Yep, no. I'm officially calling it, time of death 6:13 p.m. No, no. You know what, it just needs maintenance. We don't know the first thing about repair. Well then we're gonna learn... and tomorrow we're gonna walk. Mmm Ahh, isn't this cool crisp air invigorating? Yeah, it feels like a glacial lake. You know we wouldn't have to walk if you would've gotten a better car. Hey, you know what? Cars break down. Yeah but sometimes when you spend less money upfront it costs you more in the long run. Wow, that's like the smartest thing you've ever said. Rude. So, uh how much lotion have you sold? Shhhh. What? You got a place... In the Hamptons. In the Hamptons. Yeah. Oh, oh. Is that John? I didn't tell you but you look beautiful today. He's back? I can't believe he did that to you. He lied. You know there was always something about him that bothered me. Okay, Elinor I really don't want to talk about this right now. Let's just go to our work. He lied about Switzerland. We don't know that. Are you kidding? It could be a misunderstanding. That could be his cousin or something. They looked really chummy to be cousins. You know this never would have happened if dad hadn't stolen money. Please, don't make this about dad. It made John very uncomfortable. It's been hard on him. This has been really hard on all of us. When times get tough you see people's true colors and now we've seen his. You don't know that. Stop defending him. Are my copies ready? Oh, yep. There you go. Hey. You okay? Yeah, tough morning. Um, I wanted to show you something. Maybe after work? What is it? I can't tell you. I want to but I can't. It's sort of a surprise. Uh, okay. Yeah? Sure. Done. Good. I will have this analyzed. Figure out what's in it. Why? Mmm. I know somebody who would be interested in buying this. Something that heals would be worth tons and you keep quiet about it. This could save you your job, could save the spa. You ready? Still not gonna tell me where we're going? Nope. So, um, how long have you been with the company? Five years? Yeah, five years. Hmm, and family? Out of state. Pets? None, but I did have a goldfish when I was a kid. Girlfriend? Uh, no. I was engaged once years ago. We were probably too young, but it felt right. What happened? Her family really wasn't into it. Mine either come to think about it. They sort of persuaded us to, uh, call it off. Oh. I think she went on to marry some oil tycoon or something. And what about you? Did you move on? Took me a while, but yes. And here we are. Wow, this is amazing. So, can you tell me how many flowers are in this park? No. Come on. I'll show you my favorite and you can tell me what it actually is. Hey! Hi. Looks like you're in a good mood? Yeah, I had a really good day today. What about John? Oh well I have found someone to distract me, Brandon. Oh, man I just bought all this ice cream thinking you would be wallowing tonight over John. He took me to the most amazing garden. Oh, a garden. Good thing I got a flavor I like. I mean he must like me right? And John? Jerk. Huh. Marianne. Hey. Hey. Thank you so much for taking me to the garden. I had a really good time. So did I. I was actually looking for you. Do you wanna get some, uh, lunch? I'm actually gonna get lunch with my sister. Hey, I thought we were meeting at the cafe. I was early, so, I thought I'd come by. Hi. Brandon Hurst. Elinor Dashwood. Dashwood? I thought your last name was Webb? Um. It's my uh mother's maiden name. No jobs open, either, huh? Elinor! Hey. Must be so nice. Having a good job with people around you who don't care what your name is. I didn't want all the questions. Uh, I probably wouldn't have gotten the job if I hadn't- Lied to them. To Brandon, to me. I just, I just had no idea how selfish you are. Selfish? I have been doing pretty well considering we don't have, I don't know, a TV, a car. I haven't complained once! All you do is complain and while you've been wallowing in your own self pity I have been trying to make this work! Do you think it was easy going around from interview to interview with each person judging me and laughing me out the door? Okay so that's why I did what I did so the same thing wouldn't happen to me. No, what you did was worse. You told me there were no jobs available at your office. I have been scrubbing toilets and cleaning out clogged drains with Fran watching over my shoulder. Do you know how much more money we could have made if I had a better job? You're assuming they'd even hire you. Uh, yeah I am. Then again I also assumed that you cared about Margarett. Hey. Hey. You okay? Dashwood? Yep. It fits you better. So you're not upset? I know you. Your name doesn't change anything. Well it does to a lot of people. Well not me. Are you and Elinor going to be okay? I hope so. Gotta make you feel better. Sweet, thank you. All right, I have to ask. What is all this? Well, you know my obsession with flowers? Mmhm. This is what I do with them. You destroy them? No, I make scented lotion. Here do you want to try? Sure. Put some petals right there and just go ahead and start mixing them around. One more for you. But in a circular motion. Really? And you'll start to see some oils and then you just keep on going until all the pieces are gone. Smells planty. You need to mix some more things in it. Ow! Oh. Ow. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah. Oohh. I'm fine. I'm fine. Yeah. Well, that is not going to help, here. Let's try this. Right there? Yeah. How's that feel? Better. What do you mean it doesn't work? I tried the lotion myself. It causes an itchy rash An itchy rash? Well then, you got the ingredients wrong. Did you double check the analysis? Yes we did. We triple checked it. Well then, then there's got to be something in the process. Uh, uh try some variations. Okay extra costs will be incurred. I am paying you plenty for this. The time and resources cost money. Okay, okay. Good. Fine Good. Fine! It's Fran Farris. Well, that wasn't a very nice thing to say John. I need you to do something for me. I don't care what you're in the middle of. You do this for me and I will conveniently forget about Eliza Williams. Rumor has it that if your family were to find out about her that you would be disinherited. You understand? Good. You need any help? I'm really sorry. I shouldn't have lied. You hand me that pan? All right. Okay, just put it under the engine. Do you want me to climb under there? Okay, okay! I've been through worse things at the spa. I'm going. Okay. All right, pan's in place. All right, here we go. Aahh! What happened? Oohh. Oh no. Oh no. Don't laugh. Oh no! It's not funny. Yes, it's very funny. Hand me that towel A clean towel. Okay a clean towel. Ughhhh. Everything okay? Yeah, it's peachy. What's wrong with the truck? Um, I don't know. It won't start so I tried changing the oil but it didn't work. Do you mind if I take a look? No, oh please yes. So, how's work going by the way. Work is fine, most days. I did have to scrub a pair of sheets by hand the other day. Ew, you're kidding me. I wish. And, uh, my sister? Your sister's good. She's fine. Huh, you're holding back. Um, I uh, I get the feeling that she doesn't approve of me or something. I don't know how much longer I'm gonna be working there. Yeah my sister can be a little judgmental sometimes. Sometimes? Okay, give it a shot. Okay. How'd you do that? Hm, it wasn't the oil. I watch a lot of car shows. Trust me Dillan, once we get the bugs worked out this is going to be very lucrative for both of us. I think your company's going to be blown away by the potential. You realize that going to bat for this puts me at risk, Fran. You mess this up my reputation suffers. Oh, you won't be disappointed. Neither will your company. When can I expect this to be fixed? My people are asking about it. I have my entire team working on it as we speak. Surprise, I'm back! What are you not excited to see me? Oh oh are you talking to me or the blonde girl you were holding hands with in the park while you were supposed to be in Switzerland? Uh, look it's not what you think. She's just a friend. Oh, that looked like more than a friendship and that still doesn't explain what you're even doing here. I know it looks bad, but after your dad was arrested I was tainted. The job in Switzerland fell through. You said it was still going. I know. I didn't know what else to do. Maybe not lie. And I was afraid that being with you would make it even harder for me. Because I'm a Dashwood? Stupid, I know. Who is she? Crystal? It's just someone to talk to. It meant nothing, honestly. Look I made a mistake. Can't we just start over? I don't think I'm every going to be able to trust you again. Let me make it up to you. By the way, how's the uh hobby going? It's good. Well you should show me how you do it. I love to watch you work. You've never cared before. I do now. Maybe some other time, not tonight. Later then. Just the two of us cooking up flowers. Hey John. Yes, I got them. They're beautiful. Yeah, I miss you too. That was a fun date. Tonight? Um, hmm, well what time? You know I'm actually still at work so do do you mind if I just call you when I leave? Okay, bye. Hey Lucy, um, listen I just noticed that there was a little bit of damage to the lock on my locker. I was wondering if you knew what happened? Why would I know that? Oh no, I don't know. I mean I... You know what I wouldn't worry about it it's just that, um, I think I'm missing something. You think? I'm pretty sure. It's nothing huge I just I thought I should mention it. Well, if it's nothing huge don't bother me with it then. You shouldn't even be selling those bottles anyway. I didn't tell you that that's what's missing. Oh. Lucy did you have something to do with this? Uh okay, it wasn't even for me. It was for, it was for Edward. Edward asked me to take it. Why would he do that? Um, he wanted it to sell to some cosmetics company. A cosmetics company? Yeah, he says it's worth a fortune. Men, huh? Uh! Oh! Sorry. Watch it. Sorry. Elinor you really need to maintain a much more professional appearance. Okay, I'm sorry. Um, Lucy was just telling me about she and Edward, um... Elinor. You didn't really think that Edward was hanging around you for your personality did you? Brandon, hey. How was your day? I've had better. I'm sorry. Hey you wanna, uh, come over? Elinor's making chicken cordon bleu. Thank you, but um, I think it's best if we just kept this professional. Hey. I was just calling you. What's up? The lotion. Edward stole a bottle, actually he got Lucy to do it. What? Why? To sell it to some big company. But that's my lotion. How do we stop them? Well I don't think we can. It's not protected by a patent or anything. Uh, a patent? Yeah, Edward's a patent attorney. I can't believe I didn't see this coming. We were just getting started. Well, can't we get our own lawyer? Well what lawyer can we possibly afford? Brandon blew me off today. Yeah John lies, Edward steals, and Brandon blows you off. I thought he really liked me. We're doomed. Excuse me. My romantic sensibilities refuse to accept that. Mmm staunch denial. I like it. What are we doing with our lives? I don't know. I don't want to keep working at the spa but we need the money. Just quit. Yeah, I should get like a temporary job at the mall or something. I'm just tired of us having to fight so hard to get what we need only to be disappointed. Things used to be so much easier. Taser smoke, woo! Don't breathe this? Hello? Fran, yeah I'm working on it. I just need a little more time. We don't have more time. I keep calling her. She's not ready. Everyone is just waiting on how to make this healing lotion work. You have 24 hours or our deal is off. Hey John. Oh, uh, tonight, let's see um. .. Yeah that sounds great. Elinor, hey. I tried calling you. Yeah, I've been really busy. Can I give you a lift home? No, I'm good. How can you trust John? He called and apologized. I think it's worth another chance. He lied to you and pretended to leave the country. It's not like I have very many options now that Brandon's blown me off. You know you could go a week without a boyfriend. Come in! I was just taking off. Hi. Hi. Hi. Thanks for letting me come over. I missed you. So, are we going to cook up your little hobby? I thought we were going to dinner? Sure, after this Okay? Okay. Here it is. How was dinner? Fine. So we're good now right? You're not gonna say anything. Yes, if the information on here is accurate then your secret is safe. Edward? How are you? Uh good. Is Elinor here? Uh no I haven't seen her. You free Friday? Uh I'm busy. Thanks, though. Fran. Shhhh.... Yes? You seem awfully excited. New business deal coming through. Oh? Um did you need something? Yeah where's Elinor? I don't know. She didn't show up today. It's unacceptable really but what can you expect from people like that? Can I buy you a brownie? Think a brownie can undo what you've done? Okay, you have to help me out here. Your scheme. Stealing the formula for the lotion to sell off. I haven't stolen anything. Okay a technicality counselor, you got Lucy to do it for you. Lucy? Oh, you can't even admit it. Admit what? You really don't know what I am talking about? No. You didn't ask Lucy to steal a bottle of lotion from my locker? No. She said you did. Who did? Lucy. Okay you trusted Lucy? And then Fran said that... I don't know who to trust. You can trust me. Elinor, I would never do something to hurt you or your family. You have to believe me. I'm so sorry. I thought it was you. Don't be. I understand why you'd be upset. So wait. Did, did Lucy steal it? I don't know. And if not for you then who? Wait, what was this formula to, a lotion? Yeah it's that lotion that Marianne makes with the flowers. Flowers? Fran. Fran? Yeah Fran. She had something in her office instructions, ingredients. Instructions? What was she have..? Wait a second. Marianne was going to teach John Willoughby. I have to call Marianne. Hi I... How could you? Calm down. You stole it! Don't be so naive. It's worth a fortune. It's wrong! You're such an idealist. Don't you see? This solves everything for me. You actually think you're right? Well, it's not that black and white Edward. Give it back. The formula? It's too late. Fran. I sold it. I'm just waiting for payment to come in. Don't you see? I took care of everything. Hey I got your message. Ooh whoa. Did you really think that I wouldn't find out? Look, look it's not what you think. Oh, okay so you didn't steal my lotion and sell it to Fran Farris? Okay that part's right but I had a reason. Oh a reason. Wow, what a relief. Look Fran's been blackmailing me. It's a tough situation. Try me. All right. I had a friend and she got pregnant. If my family found out it would be a disaster for me. For you? I cannot believe I ever loved you. You only care about yourself. Hey now that's pretty hypocritical coming from you Marianne. Well at least I am ashamed of it. It's not my fault. Fran made me do it! Oh please. Don't tell me you didn't have a choice. I didn't. Look if your father hadn't been arrested everything would have been fine. Until I found out that you lied to us all. Why didn't you just break up with me? Because, I love you. Let go! Get off of me! Hey hey hey hey! Stay out of this! Just let her go man. Fine. Let's go Brandon. Wait you know this guy? Who's cheating now you little skank? John and Fran tried to steal the formula. Tried. They did steal it. Fran's been drowning in debt. She must have seen this as her way out. So, what are you going to do? I mean you can't let them get away with it. Can't you call the police. No, that won't amount to anything. This is a nightmare. There is one thing we can do. What? We can beat Fran to it. All right this pitch has to be perfect. It's a long shot, but I'm hoping they'll listen to me. And how do you know them? They're one of our biggest accounts. Here you go. Elinor? Hmm? Can you make a smaller version of that so I can give everyone a sample? Yeah. Great, and can you proof this? Yes, definitely. Your honor, yes, I wanted to check and make sure a courier delivered a filing for my firm. Great, well thank you very much. Sign here and here. We ready? Yeah. Are we sure this is gonna work? It will. And what about Fran? I'll take care of Fran. This is a great deal for you. Yes, you've mentioned that once or twice. Excuse us. Uh, this is a private meeting. Edward? Sorry to interrupt but you should have all the facts for your company's sake. Facts? This man is obviously in the wrong room. The formula Ms. Farris is trying to sell you is stolen. Which we can prove quite easily with Ms. Dashwood's documentation. How do we know this is legitimate? The proof is all there but in the meantime we've filed an injunction against Ms. Farris that prohibits this sale. Edward are you sure this is the right time to be... Yes. Definitely. We'll need our team to get to the bottom of this. That's understandable. We wouldn't want you to become victims of Ms. Farris' actions as well. However we've presented this lotion to another company that has agreed to purchase the formula. But from us. It's rightful owners. I don't know where these people came from, but there's clearly been some sort of mistake. Edward? I'm your sister. And you should know better. You completely swindled me you know that? But Dallin it's not my fault. Our biggest competitor just applied for a patent on the lotion. Our company lawyers are breathing down my neck because of an injunction they received about stolen property! It's not like that. Our lawyers are going to sink their teeth so deep into your scheming hide that not even your little lotions will help heal you. In case you haven't heard, the lotion deal was finalized today. You know the irony with this is that you were so mean to Elinor thinking she was going to steal from you, then you stole from her. I guess I have to be careful now, I don't want everyone to know that my sister's a thief. Edward I... By the way, Elinor quits. I'm doing this all wrong aren't I? No you're, actually you are. Yeah wait, let me show you. You have to move your wrist. Um, you're actually still doing it wrong. Legally were not supposed to be making this up anymore now that you sold the formula. This is a new product. Yeah. Brandon thinks we need to develop more to sell off. [Phone beeps÷} Oh... Margarett says they got the check. Mom must be ecstatic. You should be too. Margarett's gonna be okay. You did it. We all did it. Hey will you hand me that flower over there? Yeah. Oh no, not that one. The other one. Really? Wait. Are you okay? Yes, yes. I was just thinking about how I'm going to miss her. You're not wishing you could go back and change things are you? No, no. Everything worked out perfectly for her. Not just for her. For us. For us. ♪
