Scott. - I'm Jeremy. - Can I sit? - Sure. - I don't mean to be weird but the first couple of days that you were in class I kind of thought that maybe you were staring at me or was it the guy next to me that caught your eye? - It was you. - I knew it. - You just reminded me of somebody. - Who? - My roommate. - Dorm roommate? - No, I live off campus. - Oh, me too. Yeah, I got a great place near campus. I love waking up late walking no class no rush. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Pretty lucky. - Yeah. I just started learning how to cook.

Made it from scratch. - Thanks. Mm, this is delicious. - Always is. - Wow, it seems like you want a career as a chef. - No, only as a hobby. See what I'm really into is engineering like mechanical engineering like love machines making them work perfectly. What are you into? - Um, just having a nice quiet life I guess. - No, I meant like what do you study? - Oh, linguistics. - I don't know anything about that. - Um, just basically the study of language how it's formed, how it's structured. Yeah. - All right, what kind of jobs are there for that? - Not that many. But I mean you know if I get into a really good grad school then I'll probably find a job. But I have to get my GPA way up. I'll find a job. - You know I got something that would go perfect with this pasta. You're gonna love it. - Okay. - No wine for me. - You don't like wine? - No, I do. No, I really like it I just um Not tonight. - Why? - Uh, I got my reasons. Look I should've told you this. My roommate he's uh He's not just my roommate. - Oh. - I mean he's been telling me we should break up. He wants to end it then he doesn't. And he says he's just trying to get over his issues. - Yeah, everybody has issues. - Yeah, well, his issues just happen to be other guys. - Oh. - But you know he says a lot of couples have open relationships. But then he comes back to me and he apologizes for days and says he won't do it again and tells me he loves me and - How long you been with the - Elliot. - [Jeremy] Yeah. Um, two years. Yeah, two really good years. Yeah, he's the only guy I've ever been with. - You wanna change that? - Maybe I don't know.

Hey, Gavin. - Hey, mom. - Hope you're having a great time. God knows we are. - [Jeremy] We're gonna go on the Ferris Wheel later. (slow tempo drum beat) - Hi. - Hi - Jeremy. - I don't wanna hear it. - Let me explain. I'm just not ready to be in an exclusive kind of relationship. It isn't fair to you or me. We're way too young to know what we really want. - You sure about that? - Yes. - Then you should move out. - Jeremy, I love you. - I don't wanna hear it. - Come on look at me. Don't you believe me? - No. - All right I guess I guess I'll move out. Love you. (water running) - Is everything okay? - I hope you're hungry. - I was just about to start cooking. That's not the leftovers that I gave you. - I made it from scratch. Maybe we could try it with some of the wine you said was so good. - I've got a couple bottles. - That should just about do it. - Oh (laughter) enter, sir. (heavy breathing) Want me to take off my shirt? - Yeah. - [Scott] I got the drawer full of Bull. (birds chirping) - Hey, Rachael. Hey, Gavin. - [Jeremy] Hey, mom. - Hope you're having a great time. - They used to look so happy together. - Jeremy acted happy so you wouldn't worry. He wouldn't talk about it but I knew there was something wrong with them. - He looks happy with this one. - Hey, mom, dad check it out. - I know I'm sure as hell am happy. He's gonna be an engineer. - Job security. - Yes, thank God. - [Scott] Hey. - So this is the guy. - I'm the guy, hey. - He's pretty cool. (electronic dance music) (inaudible dialog) (girl laughs) - All right, pour me some. - [Female} He looks like an angel just like me. - There's angels everywhere. - [Male Partygoer] Hey, see you. You are so cute. - And you are so buzzed. Oh, I'm just getting started but I do have an idea. - Hey, I'll be back. - Don't go. - [Scott] Hey, what the hell are you doing? - [Male Partygoer] Hey, Scott, I was just telling your very cute boyfriend that it would be so nice to see you on the left side of the bed him on the right and me right in the middle. - Is that what you want? - He's just buzzed. He's only joking. - [Male Partygoer] No, I'm very serious. - Thanks but no thanks. - Male Partygoer] Okay, I'm not going anywhere.

(doorbell chimes) - [Scott] Hey. - [Bill] Hey. - Hope traffic wasn't too bad. - [Bill] It was bad. - Yeah, well, you made it here on time dinner's ready. - Happy birthday. - Hello, sir. - Sir, I think you're uh making your friend nervous. - I'm not nervous. - Right. Something smells good. - I showed Jeremy how to make your favorite. - [Bill] My son's a good cook. I hope you are too. - [Scott] Dad, you mind if I open this? - [Bill] Yeah, yeah go ahead. - [Scott] Thank you. - Okay, let's eat. So, Jeremy, do your folks live around here. - We're from New Hampshire. - That's far away. - His folks will be here in a month. They want to meet me. - So they know all about you two. - Yeah, they have no problem with us. You have a problem with us? - When do you finish school? - Next year. - Scott will be done this year. He's got engineering jobs waiting all over the place Texas, Oregon. - I don't think I'll be doing that. - You're taking one of those jobs. - I'm gonna finish my Master's here first. I don't know it depends. - It depends on what? - A lot of things. - Scott, those kind of offers they don't come around every day. - I know. - I don't think you do. - I can do whatever I want that's what you don't understand. It's my decision. - Yes, it is. Time to hit the road. - You can't drive back tonight. - [Bill] I got a job to finish tomorrow. I can't be losing customers. Good night. - [Scott] What the hell is wrong with you. (electronic dance music) - Scott. You gotta get more sleep. - This is the best work I've ever done. Check it out. - It's a lot of numbers. - I told you math was my thing. It's not right. It's absolutely not right. I got a lot of studying to do just let me finish this. You'll figure this out. You will figure this out. You'll figure this out. You'll figure this out. You'll figure this out. You'll figure it out. You'll figure this out. (faint ominous laughter) - Hey, Scott. What's the matter. - Man, we need to get some more wine a whole lot more. Some fine wine. - You studied all week for this. - The professor's out to get me. I know he's talking behind my back that asshole. Can't concentrate. - That's 'cause you're not sleeping enough. - Yeah. - Here come here. Come here. (faint voices whispering) (sinister laughter) My parents will be here tomorrow. Let's go get some sleep. - [Rachael] So your father found this great restaurant. - [Gavin] If your friend doesn't show up soon we're gonna lose or reservation. - [Jeremy] He should be here any minute. - [Rachael] Well, if he's too busy we can meet him tomorrow. - [Jeremy] No, he's just been studying a lot lately. He's got a few tests but he really wanted to meet you guys before he gets even busier. (knocking) - Oh, that should be him. (slow dramatic music) (door opens) - [Jeremy] Hey, is everything all right. - [Scott] Yeah. - It's a pleasure to meet you. - You too. - Nice to meet you. Can I get you something to drink? - Sure, thanks. - Anything in particular? (faint whispering voices) Something the matter? (faint whispering voices) - Mineral water is pretty good. - All right. - [Jeremy] Are you okay? - [Voiceover] Don't be nervous. (slow ringing tone) - Why didn't you let me open the bottle? - Excuse me. - There's something in the water. He's trying to poison me. I won't let him. - [Jeremy] No. (faint whispering voices) (slow ringing tone) (sinister laughter) - [Scott] Go away, get away from me. (indistinct dialect) (slow ringing tone) (inaudible dialect) (pulsating drum beat) I can't concentrate. - [Jeremy] Look at me. Look at me. - I'm here. (crying) I'm here. I'm here. (machine beeping) - [Operator] Dr. Montague, please call extension 13301 (indistinct mumbled voice) - [Operator] Dr. Montague, please call extension 13301 - We've given him medication that calmed him so he's sleeping. - Scott told me that his head was hurting. Do you think that he has some kind of brain tumor? - We'll be checking on all possibilities. - The young man kept saying he heard voices that wouldn't stop screaming at him. - So this is a It's a symptom of schizophrenia. - Like a nervous breakdown from stress? - After some tests we'll know more. - [Gavin] Has any of Scott's family been contacted? - [Doctor] We're trying to contact his father. - [Gavin] Anyone else? - The only contact information we do have is for his father. I need to continue my rounds. - Do you know how to get a hold of Scott's mother? - No, he never wanted to talk about her or any of his family just his dad. - Well, there's gotta be someone. Maybe you could call one of his friends and ask? - Gavin, leave that for later. The doctors will take care of him. (slow dramatic tone) - I ran into an old friend from college. His daughter had to be taken to the hospital. It was schizophrenia. - Is the girl better? - No, my friend spent every penny he had all kinds of hospitals. His daughter ended up running off. She hasn't been found. If Scott has the same thing, he'll need full-time care. Jeremy shouldn't do that. He has his whole life ahead of him. (rapid typing) (slow dramatic music) - Yeah, that's it. - What is going on with me? I got so much studying to do. I got to get out of here. - Scott, I need the truth about something. Did you ever take drugs when I wasn't around? - No. - How about before you met me any of those years that you lost from school? - No, maybe it's a brain tumor that's causing this. They can fix that can't they? - Yeah. - I'm so I'm so tired all the time. (machine beeping) - [Operator] Dr. Montague, please call extension 16601. - The hospital called and told me that my son might have some kind of mental problems. - It might be drugs that caused all this. - Drugs. - Scott swore that he never took any but if the blood tests show that he did then he could get better. - [Bill] Who would've given him drugs? - I don't know. - You know he had some wild friends. You hang out with them too? - Sir, I promise I - Don't sir me. Do not sir me. I'm gonna stay here. (heavy breathing) - You are correct. Taking some drugs can cause symptoms of schizophrenia but taking drugs doesn't cause it. The test were repeated several times. No drugs were in his blood, no signs of brain tumors. But Scott is responding well to the medicine. It was very helpful that you brought him in right away. - I read online that if someone like Scott is not violent or suicidal that he can decide what to do. - Correct. - Doctor, tell my son how difficult it is to take care of someone with this condition. - I can handle it. I'll learn how do whatever it takes. (door opens) - I've been telling my dad that I feel fine and pretty soon I'll get out of here studying back to it, graduate, get a job all that. - [Bill] Yeah, no doubt, no doubt no doubt in my mind. - But I'm staying with Jeremy if that's what he wants. - It is. - Well, listen, maybe you should rest. - No, listen I'm sick of laying around. Look I'll make a kick ass dinner. - My parents really want to meet you. - Yeah. (machine beeps) - Would you like some more Mrs. Driscoll? - It was very good but I'm full. - We still have some white wine if anybody wants some. - [Gavin] Thank you but we have to go. - Okay. - I can make some coffee. - Not for us son. It'll keep us awake. We have a very early flight. - I'm glad we met. - Same here. - [Rachael] I'll call you the minute we land. - No need to worry. - [Gavin] Honey, we can't be late. - I'll walk your parents out. Get the coffee ready for my dad. - It'll be ready. - [Scott] Well, just give me a minute with your folks, okay. - [Jeremy] Okay, okay. (slow dramatic music) - Cab will be here in a minute. I hope you believe you understand that I care for him so much. Yeah. We'll be all right. - [Gavin] Honey, the taxi's here we gotta go - [Rachael] You take care of yourself. - Sir, thank you. (door closes) - [Jeremy] Is everything all right? - [Scott] Yep. - [Bill] It's time for me to hit the road. I'll be back next week. - Call me whenever you get home. - [Bill] Will do. (door opens) (door closes) - Is everything okay? (bell rings) - Hey stranger hanging out in your favorite spot. - Yeah, I guess so. - I called couple times left messages. - I've been busy. - Me too. Heard you moved in with somebody. - I did. - How's that going? - Good, really good. - Glad to hear it. When I walked up you looked at me a certain way. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Think you do. - I got to finish reading, Elliot. - Okay. I'll see you around. - Hey. It says they just need to be taken exactly as the instructions say. - I'm good doing that. - Good. It's important. You been reading all night. - Got of lot of catching up to do. - We have a lot of catching up to do. - Doctor said I can't do that for a week or two. - Why? - Mine's not working. - With the medicine. - Yeah. - Oh, okay. Okay. - But yours shouldn't have a problem. - Scott, oh man. (slow dramatic music) (slow dramatic music) - We're celebrating. - What's the occasion. - I checked my grades got an A in everything. Yeah. - That's good. - Now for the surprise. All is working like it should. - No problems at all? - I did a test run. - With who? - A good friend whom I cheat on you with from time to time. - Okay. Well, here - The wine's all yours. I don't, I don't need it. - To good friends. - Cheers. (slow somber tone) [Scott] You never gave up on me. (car alarm) (phone chimes) (phone dials) - [Scott] This is Scott leave a message after the beep. - Hey, Scott, it's me. Just wondering where you are. Just give me a call when you get this. I'll talk to you soon, bye. - You'll figure this out. You'll figure it out. You'll figure this out. You'll figure this out. This is not possible. - [Voiceover] You failed it. He's worthless. (slow ringing tone) - Quit hiding behind the bushes asshole. (slow ringing tone) (faint voices whispering) Whoa, all right I'm coming over there. (sinister laughter) (slow suspenseful tone) Wait until I grab you by the balls. (dismal dramatic beat) [Scott] Not gonna happen. Stop moving, stop moving, stop. (dismal dramatic beat) He'll kill him. Stop following him. Following him. Stop following me. Stop following me. Stop following me. Stop following me. Stop following me. (tense dramatic beat) - [Jeremy] What happened? - Somebody's been following me. - There's nobody out there. - He's out there, listen. - Yeah, okay, I think I can hear him. - Listen. - Sounds like he's walking away. - Liar. (dark malevolent laughter) - [Voiceover] He'll kill you run. - I won't let you poison me. (faint whispering voice) - I'll kill you you understand. (faint whispering voice) - [Operator] 911. - Yes, hello I have an I have an emergency. (slow ringing tone) (rhythmic drum beat) - Where's dad? - Back home he has to take care of some troubles at our store. - Is he - No, he's fine. In a couple days the problems will be fixed and he'll be here. - Is that what's really going on? - Yes. I'll clean this up. Looks like you haven't been sleeping much. - As much as I can. - Does Scott wanna keep living with you. - He doesn't want me near him. He was telling everyone that I've been putting poison in his pills. - Might be a good idea if you took some time off school, came home. - Yeah, I been thinking about that. - Good. - I've also been thinking about all the times that dad would get depressed. He'd just lay on the couch all day with that weird look on his face I just never want to be around him. I'm just nervous all the time. - Any five year old would be nervous around someone like that. - When you first met dad if he would've gotten sick Scott do you think you would have left him? - There was a time he had been depressed for a year. We were in debt, bad debt. He couldn't work. I couldn't take it anymore. You were too little to remember. I left you with your grandmother. Truth is I wanted to runaway from everything even thought your grandmother could raise you. I was so close to getting in my car and never coming back. Back then I was so busy taking care of everybody I didn't know what I wanted, still don't. Maybe now I I need time to myself. - So you're leaving dad? - Not sure. - I don't know if I can leave Scott. - Depends on how deeply in love you are. - Yeah. I'm tired. I don't know who I am anymore. I just, I need someone to I need you or somebody - I love you. You need no listen to me this is you need to think about where you are in life right now. - Look around you. Look at where what I'm living in. I feel like I'm going crazy and where are you? - I'm here, I'm here. - No, I have to take care of you now, you see. Because you come in here and you tell me all your problems. - Jeremy, I'm here for you. I am here for you now. - Yeah, okay. (slow somber tone) - Maybe just son you - I don't want to talk about it. (crying) (phone rings) - Hello. - [Rachael] Elliot. - Hey, Rachael, how's it going. - [Rachael] I've been better. - What's wrong. - [Rachael] He's in some serious trouble. - Oh. - [Rachael] I'm over at his place. - Is he okay? - [Rachael] No, I need you I need you to come over, okay? - Yeah, yeah I can be there soon. I'll head out now. - [Rachael] Okay, I really appreciate it. - No problem at all. - [Rachael] Thanks. - All right, bye, bye. - Make sure that anything sharp is locked away. - Uh, huh. (door closes) - I have to leave tonight. Your father needs me back home. The money troubles are worse than we thought. - Anything that I can do? - We'll handle it. I told your dad that if you decided to live with Scott then there's no way I'd go back home till I knew you'd be as safe as possible. If you could let Elliot stay here for a while I'll be able to leave. I'll get sick, sick worrying if you don't let Elliot stay. Talk to your father he'll He'll tell you it's the right thing to do. (slow melancholy tone) - If you want me to go I will. - Scott was fine before he stopped taking his medicine. I'll make sure that doesn't happen again. - After I talked to your mom I read on the internet that schizophrenia mainly happens to guys between 15 to 24. - Yeah, I read that too. Did you see that it could get you at any age? There's not even a cure. - Yeah. - They don't even know what causes it not really. (crying) Goddammit. - Okay. - [Jeremy] Dammit. (machine beeps) - [Jeremy] He said that his medicine started working again? - [Bill] Right now it's better if he comes back with me. - [Jeremy] I can go with you if you want to help out. - [Bill] If you go with us what happens to your grades? - [Jeremy] I can take the classes again. - [Bill] And if it takes years for Scott to get better you gonna stay with us? - [Jeremy] Yes. - I'm gonna make this easy for you. Stay away for a little while just until he calms down. Can you do me that favor? - Yeah. (slow somber tone) Scott's dad took him back to their town. - For how long? - He, uh, didn't say. - I guess it's time for me to get my stuff out of your place. (bells ring) - If when Scott gets better I'm not sure what I wanna do. I was wondering if you could stay until I figure that out. - Yeah. - Good. - How is it? - It's delicious. It's my favorite. - I have another one of your favorites. (laughing) - Thank you. (slow tranquil music) (slow tranquil music) (applause) - [Voiceover] Graduating class of 2015. (applause) (slow tranquil music) - [Gavin] Congratulations great job. - [Rachael] Open it. - [Elliot] Wow. - [Jeremy] It's too much. - We've had a very profitable year. We'll be sending a little extra cash each month. There'll be no starving graduate students in this family. - [Rachael] I want a photo of Elliot and Jeremy. - [Gavin] Let me take it. Okay you guys ready. Nice. (slow somber tone) - [Scott] I'm too far behind I need to study. I need to study. I need to study. I need to study. I need to study. - Scott, I made you some toast. - [Scott] Ice, ice, ice to wash it down. - [Bill] What? - [Scott] Ice to wash it down. - [Bill] Wash what down? - [Scott] There's a spider in my throat. It's in my stomach. (dark dramatic music) (water running) (door opens) (door closes) (water running) (climactic dramatic tone) (inaudible dialogue) (doorbell rings) - Who's that? - Come in. - Hi, I'm Bill. - Elliot. - I need to talk to you. All week Scott kept saying over and over he was going to finish school. Then he didn't say anything for days. I looked everywhere. Local police they're looking for him to, nothing. I thought maybe, maybe he'd come back here or someplace you guys hung out. - Did he take his medicine? - No, he left all of it. He's out there all by himself. - I don't know if I can help you out. - Jeremy. - We'll find him. - We have to. (electronic dance beat) (indistinct faint conversations) (indistinct faint conversations) - We can keep going I'm not that tired. - I'm almost out of gas. - Well there's a station near here. - I think I spent about everything I have. I got to figure out a long term plan. I got some land up north that I can sell. Maybe I can hire somebody that finds people professionally. - Here. - No, no. I'll pay you back every penny soon as I sell my stuff all right? (engine cranks) You even think of somewhere he might be you call me. - [Jeremy] Yeah, okay. (doors close) Maybe we can get the landlord to let us stay just a few more months. - [Elliot] We have a lot to do before grad school. - [Jeremy] I know. - A lot to do. - I know. - Do you still love him? - Yes. - [Gavin] I would like to take you to dinner later on when I get home from work if that's okay? - Maybe. - Works for me. - Works for me too. - Business has been good this month. We can afford to send him a little extra, huh? (slow somber tone) - [Jeremy] Hey, Scott. We've got your apartment all fixed up and ready for you. Why don't we go home. - [Voiceover] Don't listen to him. - Let's go home. (slow ringing tone) (dark whispering voice) - [Voiceover] They will kill you. - [Voiceover] Stab them. - No. No. No. - [Jeremy] Scott, wait. Scott, Scott. (faint mumbling voices) - [Jeremy] Scott, stop. Scott, stop. Stop. (mumbled sinister voice) (slow ringing tone) We got to get him away from here. - How. - We have to find a way to force him into a hospital. (sirens) (indistinct conversations) (car alarm) - Scott, look. - Here, Scott, this belongs to you. (inaudible voice whispering) (crying) (mumbled voices whispering) - [Voiceover] You're worthless jump. - [Voiceover] Hey, Scott. - [Voiceover] Hey, Scott. - [Voiceover] Scott, what's wrong.

(voices whispering all at once) - [Voiceover] Jump. - [Voiceover] Jump. - [Scott] No, no. (crickets chirping) - You're doing much better very soon you'll be up and about. You're improving I can tell. Got to go. Got to go work to do. - Scott, let her go. Let go. I have something that's yours. - I can't leave him with anything sharp. - I just wanna see if he remembers it. It belongs to him. Can he just have it for a minute? - All right. (inaudible dialogue) (slow ringing tone) (inaudible dialog) (upbeat contemporary music)
