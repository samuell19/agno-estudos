it's not late not at all don't waste your energy a needle in this accupoint.... and then a second one... and then it won't hurt a bit when you die you haven't died how do you know if it hurts or not? your needles are good for sneak attacks in open areas this house is so small, so using needles is not ideal you don't recognize these two swords? impossible we've already killed you these are urgents documents get them to the courier on time or you will be blamed the senior eunuchs felt sorry for you so i kept you as a messenger if i havdn't,you'd have starved to death already cao feng,you wait here here, wait here! good morning good morning eunuch tang it's still morning if it wasn't for cao feng i'd have been here a long time ago i've been hoping to try eunuch zhang's special tea we are all envious of you who would imagine that the dark stone's wheel king is a low-ranking palace eunuch?

you haven't realized? you were only struck by a little sword energy unclog your veins,and you'll be fine there won't be a scar did you withhold anything when you taught me swordplay? i wouldn't treat you like that you... i am you...you're a eunuch i am for now i've abtained bodhi's remains in a few more days. i'll be a real man you're not a man i will be when bodhi came to china to live in the palace, he would have been castrated but the remains show that bodhi was not a eunuch, but a real man why? this is bodhi's secret kung fu i see from the intersections of the veins,i can follow the movement of bodhi's internal energy the flow goes through the main meridians of his body he could regenerate organs even if they have been cut off i entered the palace when i was twelve after fifty years, i am just a eunuch of the ninth rank i hate eunuchs i hate the way i talk i hate that i can't grow mustache i hate... i've had to hide my kung fu skills once i understand the secret of bodhi's remains and restore myself,we can retire from this world we can live freely just the two of us you really think it will grow back? we're all been fighting over the remains, and when we get them,they turn out to be a big joke do you know why i killed my first husband? because he was just like you impotent no,you're not impotent there's just nothing there this is what i am owed i am not taking any extra you! karma really is a bitch it's tough being a person you've died once before this time, it shouldn't be too difficult your name is not zeng jing and my name is not jiang ah-sheng my real name is zhang renfeng my father was minister zhang hiaduan my family is dead they were all killed by you and the dark stone most people can't survive a chest wound like this, but your internal organs are reversed most people's heart are on the left,but yours on the right doctor, can you give me a different face? then doctor li performed the surgery and told me that after your surgery you moved to nanjing you want to rent a room? what is your name my name is jiang ah-sheng thus i changed my name to jiang ah-sheng and went to nanjing looking for you i could have killed you any day however,in order to wipe out the dark stone first, i have waited until now turn around and look at me you know everything ah-sheng before you kill me. i want to ask you something did you ever love me? not at all i have no feelings for you at all! i don't care that you thought you killed me, but you killed my father! there is no way i can forgive you! go! if my father knew i killed a woman, he would never forgive me i don't ever want to see you again just go fine do you know why i am burying you under the bridge? i like you to much! this way i can see you every time i cross the bridge close your eyes good,close your eyes everything will be finished soon where do you think you're going? go back,go back go back! the two of us; we're not over yet may buddha have mercy please protect my husband jiang ah-sheng and let him live a long life the 10th yamma palace the wheel king lives alone in the 10th palace. putting souls on trial and determining life spans dividing the rich and the poor, and sending out souls for reincarnation before wisdom died,he told me the reason bodhi's remains are so renowned is because of his high level of spirtual culvation your heart overflows with violence even if you learn how he moved energy, what is the use? in this life, you will always be a eunuch you can start over why not me? i just want to be a real man is that too much to ask? i'm the one who taught you the water-shedding sword maneuver but you did't master it, and there are four errors in your technique today,i'll teach you again there are 4 sword strokes that you haven't masteres i worry that one day you'll meet a real master these four moves can beat your water-shedding sword if you don't master them you will certainly be killed! let me reap the consequerces of karma hide weakness in deathness hide weakness in deathness. use both darkness and light use both darkness and light reveal clarity in obscurity in surrender become strong how did you suddenly strike me eleven times? i would willingly turn into a bridge for 500 years and endure the wind, the sun, and the rain ah-sheng, this is tortoise powder within a few hours, your heart and breath will stop,and you will apear to be dead when the wheel king sees you,he will think you're dead i will make sure your father's death is avenged i changed all of my money into gold and paved it on the floor of our house after i die, take the money and leave the capital get married and raise a family your heart will not stop beating come on, let's go home after we get home,draw up the divorce papers don't be silly we have years ahead of us help me i down here
