[MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Sandra? In here, Charles. Oh, you're home early. Yeah. How was your day? Well, clients, clients' problems, retainers, pay outs, all very boring stuff. What have you been up to all day? Cleaning and some reading, but mostly cleaning. Cleaning. Well, it is a big house. Well, you always said you wanted a big house. Well, I do. It just takes a lot of time to make sure it's the way I know you like it. Well, you do a great job. Thanks. Come on. [MUSIC PLAYING] Want me to make you drink? You look like you're stressed. You're the one that looks like something peculiar is going on. You OK? Well, now that you mention it, I've been feeling a little strange lately. You know, it's like I'm outside of my body, watching. Like an out-of-body experience? Yeah, you know, like I'm-- like I'm a spirit from another world. That's pretty heavy. How long has that been going on? Well, ever since you gave me this old book. That thing? Listen, I'm telling you, there's nothing special about it. Well, where'd you get it? Old estate sale that the firm handled. I thought you might like it, so I picked it up for you. Who's estate? Old movie star, Vera Montez I think her name was. Her career was washed up when sound came in. She invested well, spent the last half of the century studying the occult. The occult. Wait, you don't think that this book could be cursed, do you? Will you stop it? Just enjoy it for what it is, just an old book with some naughty bits in it. Charles? Mm-hm? I want you to make love to me, now. Right now? Call it silly or superstition, but I'm on fire. Well, honey, now's not really a good time. What? I've got some important things I got to do. You've got to be kidding me. It's no joke. I-- I just said, it's just I'm busy right now, just a couple of things. That's all. Oh, you're unbelievable. Maybe you ought to stop reading those little sex novels. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [DOORBELL RINGING] Sandra, can you get the door, please? All right. Who the hell could this be? [MUSIC PLAYING] Can I help you? Is Mr. Maitland home? Yes, he is, but it's a little late. Is there something I can help you with? You have a nice house. Uh, thank you. I think I'll like it here. Excuse me? Can I speak to Mr. Maitland now? You know, just wait right here. Um, there's a girl at the front door, and she's asking for you. Really? What does she want? She didn't say. She just said that she thinks she'll like it here. How peculiar. Maybe I should look into this. Yeah, I think you should. Hello. Mr. Maitland? Yes, but you can call me Charles. I'm Constance, but you can call me Connie. CHARLES: Call me stupid, but what's going on? Sandra, meet Connie, your new live-in. Live-in? Maid. It's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Maitland. I don't get it. Honey, you've been working so hard to try and keep this house together, and you look so tired all the time. I just thought I would surprise you. With a maid. A live-in maid. We can afford it. You're serious. Dead serious. Now, what do you think about that? Oh, I don't know, but thank you. Well, maybe you could show Connie to the guest room. All right. You ready? Of course. SANDRA: Great. Follow me. Thank you. SANDRA: So I guess this will be your room. I hope you'll like it. Oh, it's fine, Mrs. Maitland. Oh, call me Sandra. Mrs. Maitland makes me sound so old. I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything. Of course, you didn't. This is much nicer than the last place I worked. It's so comfy. I don't think I'll ever want to leave. Well, make yourself at home. There's food in the refrigerator, if you get hungry, and I'm sure you'll find your way around this house in no time. What are you doing? I was just going to put on my nightgown, but if you don't want me to. Uh, no. It's fine. I'm sorry if I offended you. I come from a large family of sisters, and we're always changing in front of each other, and I forgot my manners. It's all right, Connie. I understand. I'm glad, Sandra. I'm glad they understand. I didn't want to start off on the wrong foot. Oh, I don't think we will. All right, well, goodnight, Connie. Goodnight, Sandra. Charles. So what do you think? Well, I don't know what to think. Aren't you happy? It's what you wanted, isn't it? Well, it's just, you know-- Just that what? You said it yourself, this house is too big. It's taking up all of your time, and that's no way for a beautiful woman like you to live. Am I not doing a good job? I mean, is that it? Oh, nonsense. I was just trying to do you a favor. Look at it this way, you can have all of this free time on your hands now to pursue your own interests. But to have a live-in, I mean, maybe that's a little overkill. Listen, I've got her at a one-month retainer. We owe her that. If it doesn't work out for you after a month, you and I will sit down, and we'll figure something else out. Well, I just don't know if I want a stranger living in the house. I mean, when did you even think about doing this? I don't know, actually. I wasn't thinking about it, and it's hard to explain it. Just one day, the idea popped into my head, and then Connie came into my office, and the rest is history. Let's give her a chance. What could it hurt? Well, there's something about her. She's strange. Please, you're acting like you're afraid of her. She just started. I'm sorry. I didn't think anyone was in here. That's OK, Connie. We were just having a little nightcap. Would you like me to do that for you? SANDRA: Uh, no. We can manage. All right, do you mind? Uh, no, not at all. As a matter of fact, I think a little toast is in order. To you coming to live with us. Right, Sandra? Sure. OK. Thank you, you're both so kind. Think nothing of it. Well, if you two will excuse me, I'm going to bed. Goodnight. Is she upset about something? Don't mind her. She's just had a really long day. Excuse me. [MUSIC PLAYING] You know, mixing booze and sleeping pills will knock you on your ass. So what? I can sleep in tomorrow, right? Yeah. You know, I don't get you, Sandra. I work so hard to give you the things that you want, and once you get them, you seem so unhappy. Oh, don't mind me. I don't know. I guess I'm in a bad mood. I know you're trying to help, but I don't know what I really want. Well, you sleep on it. I think when you wake up tomorrow, you'll find you have a great day ahead of you. Uh, aren't you going to come to bed? A little later, I have a few things I want to finish up. Love you. Love you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Is everything all right? Of course. I know Sandra very well. What you're doing is certainly a bold move. Yeah. Well, with great risk comes great reward. But to bring me right into your home, right under your wife's nose, you're a very wicked man, Charles. And you're a very wicked girl. Listen, we have to be careful. A little plotting, a little planning, we could do whatever we want. Right? Not yet. I know she's asleep, but she won't wake up. Because I'm married to her. She's dead to the world right now. It's booze. It's pills. It's every night, and that's how she goes to sleep. Go check. OK. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, Mr. Maitland, is there something you require? Of course, there is. [MUSIC PLAYING] What are you doing? I've brought you breakfast. You were touching me. I was trying to wake you. Where's Charles? He's gone to work already. He said not to wake you till 9:00. Yeah, right. I don't have anything to do today. Do I? You have a 1:00 lunch with your friend Sophia. How did you know that? She called earlier to confirm. Is everything all right? Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you for breakfast. Will there be anything else? No. No, that's it for now. CONNIE: This is a very old edition. Where ever did you find it? Well, Charles gave it to me, but have you read this? Once. It made me all hot and bothered. So much sex and wild abandon, it makes you think. Think what? That you can do anything with anyone. After all, it's just sex. Oh, look, it's inscribed. Wait, oh, I have never noticed this before. What does it say? Well, it says, Vera, may your hot nights be filled with passion, Joan. You see? Passion goes on forever. It never dies. Even beyond the grave? Who's to say? [PENSIVE MUSIC] [PHONE RINGING] This is Charles. Charles, it's Sandra. Well, hello, honey. How are you feeling today? Oh, fine. Why? Just asking. Well, I'm sorry. Don't mind me. I guess I was asleep when you left this morning. Well, that's OK. You're allowed to sleep in every now and then. Yeah. Well, I just wanted to say thank you for Connie. Well, you're welcome. SANDRA: (ON THE PHONE) No, I've been childish, and I don't know why I've been acting that way lately, but I want to make it up to you. Well, what did you have in mind? Well, I don't know, but I'm sure I'll think of something. Well, I can't wait. Any big plans today? I'm meeting Sophia for lunch, but other than that, no. Oh, well, tell Sophia I said hello. Will do. Love you. Love you too. KEITH: Morning, Sandra. Oh, Keith, I didn't know you were working so early. I've got some projects out back that require more attention than others. Those are pretty. Yeah, I didn't want them to go to waste. Do you have a vase? I thought they'd look nice in your kitchen. Sure. This'll work. They have a certain beauty to them, don't you think? A fresh, unspoiled sort of beauty. Yes, they do. Will you be here later? Most of the day. Well, I have a lunch appointment, but I'll see you later on this afternoon. I'll be working in the backyard. Have fun. It's going to be hot today. You new around here? Yeah, I just started last night. I didn't know the Maitland's were even looking to bring out a housekeeper. Mr. Maitland hiring me as a surprise for his wife. KEITH: Was she surprised? I believe she was. Not as surprised as she's going to be, I suppose. What's that supposed to mean? Gardener's intuition. A psychic gardener? Wow, who would have thought it? Look, I like Sandra. I like her a lot. I don't want to see her upset. I like Sandra too, and I think maybe with a little time that she'll like me as well. I am here to serve. Didn't you think there'd be enough work around here to bring someone on full time. There's not. In fact, I have a little free time right now. Is that right? Yeah, and the house will be empty for the next few hours. I think you and I would make much better friends than enemies. Don't you think? [MUSIC PLAYING] Is this what you want? Yes. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hi, I hope I'm not late. I already knew you were running late. You're funny. No, I'm serious. You and those cards. Next thing you know, you're going to be trying to tell me my fortune. You shouldn't be so quick to laugh, Sandra. If you know anything about me, it's that I never joke about the supernatural. Well, OK, I'm not laughing. Actually, I've been thinking a lot about the supernatural lately. Really? Tell me about it. Well, it's nothing I can put my finger on, but there's a lot of strange things going on around my house. That, and there's like a presence or something hanging over me. I want you to tap the cards four times. Oh, OK, eeny, meeny, miny, mo. OK, let's see, and describe how you're feeling. Charles gave me this book, "Lady Chatterley's Lover," and every time I read it, I have the most vivid daydreams, like I'm inside the book. And there's something wrong with that? Well, no, not in this book, but then I found out it belonged to a dead woman, a silent movie star, Vera Montez, and she used to practice the occult. And then, this woman, she shows up in my house, and she becomes my maid. Wait, slow down. You're going too fast for me. Well, that's exactly how this is all happening, way too fast. Then, this girl, Connie, she keeps undressing, OK, and touching me while I'm sleeping. OK. So you think this all has something to do with that book. Oh, that would be impossible, right? Well, there's definitely something unnatural going on in your life right now. Are you and Charles happy? And I mean, you know, like happy in bed. Uh, there is nothing going on in that department. Actually, maybe that's the real source of your problems. You're not getting what you need, so subconsciously, you're sending out this sexual vibe that others are picking up on, or-- Or what? Or the ghost of Vera Montez is possessing the book, and she's living out her undead sexual fantasies through those around her. Oh, holy shit. Wait, what can I do? What you need to do is fix your sexual problems with Charles, and see if that takes care of the problems in the rest of your life. You know what? You're right. That's exactly what I'm going to do. Good. Let me know how it turns out. I will. Thanks. That or you're bat shit crazy. [BUZZING] Yes? (ON SPEAKER) Your wife is here to see you. My wife? Send her in. Charles. Sandra. I thought you were having lunch with Sophia. Yeah, we met, proved very interesting. Yes. Well, out of all of your friends, she is the most interesting case. Everything OK? Yeah, everything is fine, Charles. How's Sophia? Very enlightening, as she always is. Again, with the fortune-telling cards? Well, she has a very real talent, and she always amazes me. What did she say this time? She told me that the old book that you gave me is possessed by the spirit of its former owner. The book, possessed, by like ghost? By ghosts or-- What? Well, it's either that, or we're just not having enough sex. What do you think it is? Well, that's what I'm here to find out. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh my god. That can't be. [MUSIC PLAYING] It can't be, but it is. It's true. I've got to warn Sandra. [CHIMES RINGING] Oh my god, you must be-- Yes, I'm Vera Montez. But you're dead. Yes, but thanks to "Lady Chatterley's Lover," I'm enjoying myself much more now than I ever did when I was alive. So your spirit's trapped inside that book? I wouldn't say trapped, but possessed, definitely. But why? I was once a big star, the biggest in Hollywood, and then talking pictures came along, and nobody wanted me anymore. Fortunately, I had saved my money and invested well and I lived my life in luxury. But I was alone, starved for the attention of men. And now, in death, you're young again. And able to indulge in whatever I desire. You can't possess Sandra. It's wrong, and I won't let you. I'm not possessing anyone. In fact, I'm just helping them free themselves from their own sexual hang-ups and enjoying myself a little along the way. But they can't resist your magic. They have no will of their own. You've had a spell over them. Not a big one, but I do get what I want, and so do they. How does it work? First, I look at them, and then I touch them, and then they want me, just like you do right now. Your touch is like a drug. All I can think about at this moment is how badly I want to make love to you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello? Anybody home? [MUSIC PLAYING] Connie? [PHONE RINGING] This is Charles. Uh, Charles, it's Sandra. Oh, hey. You made it home OK. Yeah. Um, yeah. I'm at the house now, but there's no one here. Oh. Well, go ahead and start dinner without me. I'm going to be working late anyway. Just don't let it get cold. All right, well, dinner's on the table, you know, and that's what worries me. CHARLES: (ON THE PHONE) Oh, don't worry yourself. Connie probably started dinner and forgot something, went out to get it. Yeah, you're probably right. Well, what else could it be? You're making a big mystery out of everything lately. Yeah, you're right. Of course, I am, and um, thanks for this afternoon. We should do that more often. Any time. Bye. Bye. Is it possible? Could this book be possessed? CONNIE: It could be. SANDRA: Oh, I didn't hear you come in. I'm light on my feet. Where have you been? Oh, around. That's not a real answer. Well, if you must know, I went to visit your friend. Sophia. Sophia, why? Let's just say we have some common interests. Is she all right? Better than all right. In fact, I think I helped to relieve a lot of tension today. May I? Oh, yeah. "Lady Chatterley's Lover." do you know how many times I've read this book? No. Too many to count. I've spent many years pleasuring myself to this book. I've almost worn the pages out, and now it's yours. Have you ever touched yourself while reading it? Don't lie. A few times. It's good, huh? Are you the ghost Vera Montez? Well, I guess the cat's out of the bag. Are you scared? No. Good. I just want to get you and your husband back on track, get you guys interested in each other again. And then what? And then I want you to pass the book along to one of your girlfriends, a hot one. I can do that. Good. Now, let's lay down. OK. What are we going to do? I want you to read your favorite part of the book while I touch you. We can enjoy this book together. All right. [MUSIC PLAYING] Sandra. Where the hell is everybody? [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Charles? It's Sophia. Oh, Sophia, you're looking for Sandra. SOPHIA: (ON PHONE) Yeah, is she there? I don't know. Well, I just go home. I don't see anybody. Charles, listen to me. Your new maid is a ghost. She has the power to hypnotize people. It's like witchcraft or something. Listen, this whole business is just getting crazier and crazier. Next thing you're going to tell me she turned into a bat or something. Charles, stay away from her. She could be dangerous. Well, thank you for the warning, but I can handle Connie. Heed this warning. I found out the truth from myself today. I hear you loud and clear. I'll tell you what, I'll have Sandra give you a call as soon as I find her. Charles. Bye. Ghosts, witches wow. [MOANING] SANDRA: That feels good, right? CONNIE: Yeah, it does. SANDRA: Yeah, you like that? CONNIE: Yeah. Oh, Charles. Don't let me interrupt. Why don't you join us? I don't think that's going to be a great idea. Charles, if we help her now, then her spirit will leave the house and everything will go back to normal. Like a sexual exorcism. Exactly. Well? Well, since I don't believe in any of this spiritual mumbo-jumbo, I guess it wouldn't hurt. Not unless you want it to. Stand back and let the sexorcist do his thing. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHIMES RINGING] What have you been up to all day? Cleaning. I mean, some reading, but mostly cleaning. Call me stupid, but what's going on? Well, it's either that, or we're just not having enough sex. Listen, this whole business is just getting crazier and crazier. Next thing you're going to tell me she turned into a bat or something. Yes. Well, out of all of your friends, she is the most interesting case. Maybe you ought to stop reading those little sex novels. Mr. Maitland hired me as a surprise for his wife. I was just going to put on my nightgown, but if you don't want me to. I was once a big star, the biggest in Hollywood, and then talking pictures came along, and nobody wanted me anymore. SANDRA: Thanks. That or you're bat shit crazy. You can't possess Sandra. It's wrong, and I won't let you. Are you and Charles happy? And I mean, you know, like happy in bed. They have a certain kind of beauty to them, don't you think? A fresh, unspoiled kind of beauty. I like Sandra. I like her a lot. [SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]
