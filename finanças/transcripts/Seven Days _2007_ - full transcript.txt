You should know me. I never forget debt I owe. Come see me if you need anything. Any time. I don't think we should meet ever again. It's a gift. This is the court evidence. Are you sure you can give me this? If we had lost, you would've served 15 years. Put this instead in your closet for 15 years. It's a superstition, but it's supposed to work. So, this thing will do time for me? Like a living dead, in the closet? You've never lost a case. Did you expect to win this time again? Lawyer Yoo Jiyeon Bring the record of prosecution as a problem _ Again? _ Yep. You want a lot today. Making three wishes? What did you wish for this time? It's a secret. If you don't tell me, I'll let Huijin's mom win the race tomorrow! No! I've got to beat Huijin! I want to sit with Dongjun... - Dongjun? - The boy who sits with Huijin. So, that's why you want to beat Huijin so bad? Jisoo saw Huijin and her mom practicing. She said they were really fast! You didn't know? I used to be in the school track team. How would I know without any proof? Here is the proof! Can't you tell I'm fast? They'rejust old lady legs. Liar! You really think I'm lying? Come in first tomorrow. Then, I'll believe you. Hey, hold on. Ms. Lee, what's the matter? Good morning! Thursday - Morning! She's out of the office today. Yes, I know she's not in. Hey, I told you she's not here. Hello, hello. Have you been working out? - Did you have breakfast? - Mr. Kim, - you really are too much! - What's the fuss? This is just a personal visit. Personal. OK? It's alright. Let him be. I told you, man. Ms. Lee, espresso for me. Hey, when are you going to fire that old ass? He has some temper. Did he really think I won't be able to find you just because he won't tell me? These old people are so insensible. How much are you paying him anyway? Watch your words. He's like a father to me. And I told you. I can't take your case. How long have we known each other since grade school? You just can't do this to me. See, your friend is about to go under. I can lose everything! You are the one to blame, not me. Those fuckers are going to bury me and wrap this thing! I've been taken off duty, and even the internal investigation is on! Why did you have to cut off electricity? You think you work for Con Edison? The fire alarm was ringing. The light was off. You set the place on fire, and took money from them? So, you are going to take my case! That's where you got it wrong. Mr. Would never give away money like that. What kind of a cop dares to take bribes these days? Okay, just get out of here. Thanks a lot, Jiyeon. You are my best friend. Are you still here? This is the kind of place you have to go before you die. You been there, right? Isn't Hawaii great? Remember how I used to be faster than you? Faster in what? I'm running a 100M race today. Is that right? Good luck! Don't worry about a thing. Even if you come in last, I'll catch everyone up. That's Huijin's mom. Okay.

Radio them to back off! Patrol car! Can't you see the police following you? Quickly! Speeding in the tunnel in front of the Assembly Hall in Yoido, Over! When you come out of the tunnel, turn left at the alley! I was just here! What do you want? What do I want? Cut the crap. Take this money and let my Eunyoung go... I told you not to call the cops! I turned them away! You turned them away? The deal's off! Everything that happens from now on is your fault, because you broke the promise, You will never see your daughter again, Eunyoung! Eunyoung! Eunyoung! Eunyoung! * Let's go to the mountain or the sea Saturday * with mom, Start without me. - Do I have to eat alone again? - You'll be late for school. It's Saturday. No school on Saturdays. You are right, It is Saturday. You promised! Did you forget? Right, the roller coaster! All my friends said they've been on it! Okay, mark my words. We'll definitely go today. The babysitter will be here any minute. Are you going to call the police again? No. Hi, chief. It's Saturday today. I will give you one last chance, Take it easy. I can see you, So, don't mess with me andjust go turn on your laptop, Hang on, chief. This is your last chance, Tell them that Eunyoung is at her grandmother's, Get out of there, right now, Are you all right? Yes, I'm fine. Just heard Eunyoung is at her grandmother's. Apparently, someone brought her there in the morning. I will give you a call once I know for sure. Could you all leave now, please? The money is with me. Just tell me where. Don't worry about the money, I was just testing you, I hate cops, Then what? Why do you think I kidnapped a lawyer's kid? Why the best lawyer's daughter? What are you saying? What do you think about the death penalty? What about it? I'm all for death penalty, I believe those trashes deserve death, they should get rid of statute of limitations and all that shit, Anyways, there's someone who's been falsely accused, He was sentenced to death at the trial court and filed an appeal, It breaks my heart, whenever I think of him, Because he was framed, What does he have to do with my daughter? I'm losing sleep over him, He has a court-appointed lawyer and you know what it's like, I want you to get him out of there, The court of appeal is next Wednesday, so you have exactly four days, The time is running out, but what can we do? You're the one who wasted time with the police, Case number 2007 NOH 2357. Hang on. I don't get this. I know you've been recording this conversation, Get him out at the court of appeal, Whatever it takes! If you fail, you will never see your daughter again, Eunyoung! Eunyoung! Eunyoung! Hello? Sorry for calling you so late. We have a new case. Sunday a 23-year-old art student. Jang Hyejin, aka HJ, went missing at her studio. A milk delivery guy called the police after seeing blood oozing from under the door, HJ was found about a fortnight later on August 16 at a marsh in Misari, as a dead body, So the murderer killed her at her studio and buried the body in a marsh, Surprisingly, the killer was arrested quite soon, two days after the crime, Jeong Cheoljin, aka CJ Age 35, He's been to prison five times on charges of rape and violence. The fingerprints and footprints from the scene match his perfectly, HJ's wallet found in the living room contained both HJ's blood and CJ's fingerprints, He denied everything, but was prosecuted after the body had been found, The court of appeal comes within three days, At the moment, he's most likely to get a death sentence, This case is proceeding way too fast. Can you find out who is behind the victim? From the circumstances and evidence, he's the killer. Who was the coroner and the officer in charge? Who could the coroner be? Of course, Dr. Jo is. You know he digs whatever that's gross. - What about the officer in charge? - Can't get hold of him. I don't want to hear that you can't. What's in it for them? Do you think they'll take our calls? The CJ case? Sure. That case is closed, but why? What? What about me? Hey! The internal investigate Don't make this difficult. Motherfuckers! We are a family. I hope you spend the rest of your shitty life chasing after other people's asses, you bastards! From now on she will be defending you in court. She's very talented. At least, you'll be saved from death sentence. So, sign this form to change lawyers and cooperate. The trial is only three days away. What are you doing? Listen! You said you were going to save my life! You told me to trust you. She's the best lawyer in town. She may even prove you innocent! Don't fuck with me! I will make you innocent. Trust me. Fuck you! Counsel, help me. Please, I'm begging you. Don't! I want to live. There's only three more days to go. You have to stick with me. Please? Fuck! I didn't kill her. You all know that! Let me go. Jiyeon, the internal investigators are after me. Where are you now? Did you get what I asked for? What are you talking about? I'm in deep shit. Aren't you being selfish. I need to see them tomorrow! What do you want to meet HJ's parents for? Don't tell me you took on the CJ case. Did you? - I know what I'm doing. - No, Jiyeon. No way! He's a pervert and a killer. Money is nice, too, but if you have the time to defend that asshole, think of Eunyoung first. I think I told you. Eunyoung is fine. But according to our records, your paralegal never called you. Do I have to repeat myself? Would I be here if she hadn't come back? Then, tell me who brought her. We can't just let him go away. If the police moves, he said he'd kill her. Let us catch him, then. Catch him? He knew your every move. You get it? - Ms. Yoo. - If you guys move, she's dead! Monday. Hello? Hi, this is Park Gibok, the court-appointed lawyer, I just got a call from CJ, Now he wants to change lawyers, All right. You needed money for your widowed mother's medicine. She had diabetes. So, you needed money for her insulin shots. You knew it was bad, but you had no choice. When you went to steal just a few things, she was already dead. So, you rushed out. That's how the fingerprints and footprints were left on the scene. How is Prosecutor. He's the best candidate for a senior prosecutor position. I hear you are, too. I still have a lot to learn. Come on, there's no one else of your caliber. I hear your winning rate rose to 90%. With your support, I have every confidence. Which brings to my mind... Do you know about the CJ case? I want you to take that case. The CJ case? The appeal court is in two days. Yoo Jiyeon is his lawyer. She's already trying to change the court date. What do you think? Get even with her this time. It's a great opportunity. No, it's you who should be helping me, - not the other way round. - The trial is in two days. If I get caught, I'll be arrested for sure. My whole retirement plan, pension plan will be gone. I'll be damned. I took care of it, for now. You won't have any problems. What is this? These bastards should be arrested. Not me. Aren't you amazing, Yoo Jiyeon. Fighting corruption with corruption, huh? All right, way to go! No wonder, they stayed so quiet. You know Dr. Jo, right? The fat pervert? There are usually two reasons for disfiguring a face like this. One is to hide the victim's identity. The other is more psychological. The killer knows the victim and cannot bear her watching him. So, the killer wants to deface the victim and turn her into an object, instead of a person. You mean they knew each other? That's all bullshit! Theory and practice rarely match. Crime scenes don't show those patterns. He's either a wacko or a revenge freak. And there's something interesting about this case. A mixture of chaos and order. It's typical of the disorganized crime. It wasn't planned enough. Was done impulsively, outofangen. You see, the scars are random, This type is not thorough, They usually leave their marks all over the scene, But a professional took care of the body, He shaved off her pubic hair and cleansed the body with alcohol, This is typical of the organized type, The corpse was thoroughly disposed of, with no proof left, Good way of putting it. By the way, what's the murder weapon? The stab marks are horrendous. A sculpting knife shaped like a saw. You should know this stuff. It is a saw, not a knife. Must have hurt like hell. Consider this as the sculpting knife, and this steak as muscles. At the right side of your body. What are you doing? Eat your steak. Once you put a knife in muscles instinctively stiffen. And they hold on to the knife. Until now, there isn't much pain. - Because it all happens in an instant. - Could you stop already? The problem begins when you take out the weapon. The difference between a knife and a saw is enormous. Imagine it grating against your muscles and bones. What's the important thing you wanted to tell me? Drug was found inside HJ's mouth. It was so little that I wasn't sure at first. But then, I looked more closely, and it turned out to be phencyclidine. A hallucinogen, also known as 'angel dust'. Still haven't found the sculpting knife yet? The murder weapon is the most convincing evidence. What's that thing? A talkie? How is Eunyoung? She's fine, though there was a slight problem this morning, She had a tuna sandwich for breakfast, No! She's allergic to tuna! - So it was the tuna, ,, - She needs to go see a doctor. Soon, her face will swell and she'll have trouble in breathing! It's not that bad yet, Take her to the hospital right now! How can I take the kid I kidnapped to the hospital? Tell me where I can meet you. I have medicine at home. We can't meet outside, I will never call the police. Please tell me where. It's not that bad yet, I'll go back and check up on her first, By the way, why are those two guys arguing like crazy? We're running out of time, Did you see who was sitting here? - Get off! - Stay still! What's wrong with you? If you keep calling me, I'm going to tell your wife, Yes, the CJ case! I've come to meet with the victim's mother. How do you do, professor? Remember me? I'm Officer Kim who was right next to CJ when we caught that bastard. I did everything I could do. I don't even want to think about it, so pleasejust go. The thing is... Your daughter's not his only victim. He's accountable for five other crimes. I know. That lady over there... She's the sister of his third victim. I'm Yoo Jiyeon. Han Sookhui. Ms. Yoo here is a writer. She wanted to write about the suffering and pain of the victims' families... So I brought her here. I can still vividly remember. She was so happy to get her driver's license. So I bought her a car. In her favorite color, red. How about relationships? At that age, she must've had some guy problems. More importantly, I heard that CJ has a new lawyer. A very good one, too. What if they reduce his sentence? That's not even remotely possible. The death sentence will hold. He shouldn't be ever set free. At least for my daughter, he has to pay for his sin. I can't open it. Can't open it? Giving it up that easy? If a locksmith can't open the door, what good are you? Get your dad over here then! Even my dad can't open this Unican lock. It's very well known, but I don't think it's been imported to Korea yet. You don't even try it, you little brat. You sure there's no way to open it? There is one. Just one. Are you sure you want to do this? Trespassing and damaging properties. Well, you're the lawyer... Wow, this is the real thing. I didn't trust him to be this good. Look at the blood! It began at the sofa. This is where he beat and stabbed her. HJ wasn't dead yet, And she tried to hide in the bathroom, And he finished her off in the middle of the living room, Why start at the sofa? It means she was talking with the killer when he attacked her. Did she know the killer? - No. - What about CJ? You keep saying that, but those of us who do the dirty work also have work ethics! We don't accuse innocent people! What about what Dr. Jo said? Don't take his bullshit! That's just a presumption. Chaos and order do not co-exist in the crime scenes. Any other police officers would have pointed their fingers at CJ! No one is 100% sure. What makes you so sure? Look. The fingerprints are all over the place. So are the footprints. The killer is clever enough to shaved off her pubic hair to get rid of evidence. Shejust doesn't satisfy about it. Maybe CJ was right. Maybe she was already dead when he went there. Someone came back to the studio with her that night, HJ must have been drunk, They were talking on the sofa, Something happened between them, And she was killed right then and there, CJ came into the studio, After HJ was murdered, he got scared and ran away, Someone came back to the studio with her, killed her, and cleaned up after himself, Someone was there on the scene, We need to find him! The card is mine, but I have never heard of CJ. He had your card. Think again. I usually run out of these in a couple of days. Every show, I shake hands and give out my cards. I don't remember 90% of those who I meet. Like I said, I mostly deal with upper-class clients. I have a show on Wednesday at the Continental. Please drop by. A lot of people you know will be there. And celebrities. You don't have another one? That's for VIP. I had only one left. Get me every document you can find on the CJ case. Including the photographs. Everything. Could you find me the HJ's car ASAP please? It's not that easy to steal info from the police system. It's been over a month. - It's probably already been scrapped. - We gotta find it as soon we can. Even if it means we have to search through everyjunkyard in the country. You are scaring me now. Are you working for the President or something? We need to find the murder weapon before the prosecution does. I know you're a workaholic, but isn't this too much? Is there a reason why CJ shouldn't be the murderer? What is it?! Whatever she does, CJ will get the death penalty, Yoo Jiyeon is a tough nut. I have all the circumstantial evidence I need. I'm going to beat her this time. Good luck. It feels lousy to lose at the last minute turnarounds. About your request yesterday... That... As you said, he's a middle boss. He owns a few shops, He's the dirtiest trash, Fraud, Violence, Murder, Instigation Yang Changgu He's the one, With this kind of record, I can get him to do anything. Thanksalot. May I ask what you need him for? Just an errand. By the way, did you find the sculpting knife? Well, it doesn't really matter. That money you gave me. Wasn't that a bribe? No. Who bribes a cop these days? Just some pocket money. It's okay. Mr. Hwang masterminded all this, didn't he? Hey, Ronaldo! Get me kimchi! Yes sir. Fuck! That damned internal investigation. We both owe you a big one. We'll do whatever you say, I'll do whatever you tell me to. Then, you call Mr. Hwang right now. Yes, that will show him how generous you are. On August 2, 2007 A red Elantra disappeared. He says a red Elantra disappeared on August 2, 2007. - 61 RA 2843 - 61 RA 2843 - Find it by tomorrow. - Find it by tomorrow. Isn't it too soon? Even with all the boys working? If you don't find it, I'll have to kill you tomorrow. Come on in. - Hello? - Where are you? Don't you sleep at all? You've seen the reports? I'm going to find Wolf, Come quickly, The Rolling Stones? The last place HJ visited before she was killed, That club? We have a suspect there called Wolf, He's a band member, A regular Sherlock Holmes! But you've got the wrong guys. You're talking about the band Joplin? - They have an alibi. - You can make up alibis all the time, And you can't trust the police investigation, What time is it now? You spent the whole night up. I'm looking for Wolf. Mind your manners, bitch. Weed. What a way to start a day! Hey, you, got any more weed? Who the hell are you? You son of a bitch. Who do you think you're talking to? I'm a cop. Ohhhh, a cop. Fuck. Who the fuck are you? Cops? I'm here to get you, you crackheads. Get them! Tuesday. Hey, you! You're Wolf, right? I want to hear about HJ. Fuck you! Tell me, what happened that night? You were with her! First of all, you've been arrested for violating hemp control law. Motherfucker. You have the right to an attorney, which won't do you any good. And you have the right to remain silent. But if you exercise it, you die right here. Understand, motherfucker? Tell me about HJ. What happened that night? Fuck. They caught the murderer. You could be the murderer. Maybe you're all in it. Fuck you! Fuck what? Fuck what? Motherfucker, what the fuck do you want me to fuck? Huh? Huh? Own up. Come on! What happened that night? A cigarette would be nice. She had really been a nice girl. Before she met him. - Met whom? - We met at a club. He studied in America. He had his nose pierced. Pierced? Go see what's in HJ's computer. She took photos with him with a digital camera. What happened that night? You went to see her. She changed completely after meeting that asshole. She didn't even properly break up with me, I went over there, really pissed off, But then I saw her car coming out, I thought what the heck, and followed the car, And I saw it hit a Jaguar, But it just turned around, I thought it was strange, so I followed it again, I had a feeling that she was with him, After about ten minutes, her car came out again, I felt lousy, so I just came home, I felt like I could kill a person if I had followed it, Stop beating around the bush. Just tell the truth! Smoking weed makes your head clear. What is this all about? I told everything I knew at the police station. There's something wrong with Eunyoung, She can't seem to breathe, Where shall we meet? The light plane Runway. Yes, that's the place, A little far but, ,, Whether you call the police, you'd better come quickly, Eunyoung doesn't look good, There's a box behind you, A little gift to cheer you up, No time to be sentimental, Put the car key and the medicine in the pocket by the dog's haunch, What are you doing? Untie the dog! The medicine is only temporary, Looking at Eunyoung's state, she needs to go see a doctor quickly, To do that, your client has to be set free soon, Eunyoung! Eunyoung! Eunyoung! You're faster than I thought, Your car key is in the mailbox, No time, Run! I trust you'll do the right thing, I'm kinda tired of riding in the trunk, now. - What are you doing here? - What about you? - Who asked you to be here? - You did! Your face, your eyes, your awkward behavior! - Where is Eunyoung? - At her grandmother's. I heard you talking in the trunk. Where is Eunyoung?? She's been kidnapped... Get off. You stay away. So, the ransom was to prove CJ's innocence? So that's why you took on this case? They'll kill her, otherwise. All right. Now that I know, you do your job and I'll do mine. - No, don't! - Hey! He's been watching me. He was listening to everything we said at the restaurant yesterday. Did you know Eunyoung used to call me once in a while? Uncle! Can you please play with me? Mommy is "always busy." 'I want to ride the roller coaster.' 'Everyone has ridden it, except me' Eunyoung is important to me, too. Now only three of us know she has been kidnapped. You, me and... that motherfucker. Let's get going. The trial is tomorrow. The kidnapper is definitely somewhere near CJ, I'm going to find out about CJ's friends, Go to HJ's studio and search the computer, If you find anything related to the piercing, send it to me, I'll do some background checks, No one came to see CJ other than the lawyer? Okay, I got it. Hey Jo, you know about the CJ case? Look up his records and get me the list of CJ's former cellmates. What threat? I'm asking you. Is there anything else you needed to take apart other than the door lock? Well... I'm trying to keep this place as if she was alive. So I can still feel her presence. I'm really sorry. What brings you here today? I wanted to look into HJ's computer. For research... Look all you want. Everything in this room is the same as when HJ was here. Except the lock, of course. Do you have a child? I have a little girl. She's eight years old. She's... traveling right now. A Thursday's child. Monday's child is fair of face. Wednesday's child is full of woe. Friday's child is loving and giving. But Thursday's child has far to go. An old English nursery rhyme. Come to think of it, my baby was born on Thursday. They say his sentence might be reduced to lifetime-in-prison at the trial court. His lawyer is so good that it's possible. What if that man gets away with the death penalty? What if hejust walks away? What if... I get to live under the same sky with the man who brutally killed my little girl? By the way. I heard you're a lawyer, not a writer. And I heard who your client is. Jeong Cheoljin - CJ. Have you found any evidence that might be in his favor? I had no intention of lying to you from the beginning. Then, were you going to tell me that you represent the man who killed my daughter? You are making a big mistake. Yes, hello. Do you know Choi Gyeongsook who used to live next door? No. You know, I just wanted to know whether she'd moved. - I don't know her. - Excuse me! Hey! Old ladies have such hot tempers. Hey, Officer Jo! About Choi Gyeonsook you know, CJ's girl. Yes, yes. I came by to see her, but she's moved. I thought maybe you knew. Yeah, the address. Am I really going to get out of jail? Meet me on the 6th Floor of Yongsan Station parking lot, when you come out, I thought Yang Changgu was bad. But now CJ? That trash?! Are you trash, too? Fuck. So what if he's a prosecutor? Calling me a trash? I'm going to kill him one day! What about the guy with the pierced nose? His name is Gang Jiwon. 23 years old. He took some language courses in America and he's in rehab right now. Gang Jiwon was most likely at the crime scene. He probably parked the car for her. But he's not our guy. Gang Jiwon has been in this hospital since July 26, 2007. A week before HJ died! A typical case. He goes abroad, doesn't fit in and starts marijuana. Then he moves on to LSD and phencyclidine. Are you sure Gang Jiwon was admitted on July 26, 2007? Yes, I'm positive. He was admitted at 4pm on July 26, 2007. You remember HJ? She was an angel. I was really comfortable around her. I didn't hear any damn thing andjust felt good. Could you stop that, please?! What? That recorder! It's driving me crazy! Hey. he)”. What's going on here? Gang Jiwon is a Class A patient. Did you forget only his guardians are allowed to see him? That guy's a wacko. Did you see how he went crazy all of a sudden? No.1 law court Trial starts 11 am, That wacko. Are you all right? - Turn it around! - What are you talking about? Turn the car around! Now! I know who killed HJ, No longer than three minutes. Thanks. Good to know I'm at least good at something. One... Two... Three, Four... Five, Six... Sevenun. Okay! Why did you come back? Who killed HJ? You said you know who killed her. Who told you that? I did? I don't remember... Come on. Tell me everything you know! Whatever you do, they're always a step ahead of you. You'll never win. They? Who are they? What happened that day? Tell me! This is so much fun. I know who killed HJ, Wednesday. Hello? No, she didn't notice anything. Yes, I'm fine. Yes, the kidnapper was you, Choi Gyeongsook... There's more than one? Do you remember me asking you to open the lock for Apt.306 at Geonyang Villa two days ago? Do you remember? - Yes. - Did you open it? No. Why not? As I told you, that's the latest version from America. My dad has been in the business for 30 years, but he can't open it either. If a professional like you can't open it, it will be hard for most people including sneak thieves, right? That's why I took the whole thing out. Did you perform an autopsy on HJ's body at 3pm on September 18, 2007? Yes. What did you find during the autopsy? A small amount of chemicals was found. Which chemical exactly are they? It's a form of hallucinogens called phencyclidine. What kind of daughter was HJ? A very precious one, like to all mothers. When did she start living alone? Since the third year at college. So, it's been two years. How were your daughter's relationships with men? Objections, your honor. This has nothing to do with the case and is clearly to defile the victim. It could be a vital information to find the real killer. Objection denied. Continue, counsel. Did you find your daughter promiscuous? I repeat, did you find your daughter promiscuous? It doesn't matter. What matters to me now is... my daughter is no longer alive. Every time I dream about her, she begs me to return her life. Then, I cannot sleep for many nights. I'm scared of looking at her disfigured face. I feel sorry. Too sorry to see her. Did you know your daughter was on drugs? No. If a female in her early twenties lived alone, she's sure to have many men in her house. HJ was on drugs and promiscuous. If the lock was opened that night, it means HJ opened it herself. It is highly likely that the killer who came into the apartment that night is probably one of the many men that HJ invited herself, not some petty thief who had to steal to pay for his mother's medicine. That'll be all, your honor. Recess. The trial will continue in a hour. Ms. Yoo! Whatever you say, she means everything to me. Let's go. Yes, go on. Get moving. You should be curious about how your boyfriend's trial turns out. Captain. It's a kidnapping case. I need backup. I tell you there's more than one. Did you see the look on Prosecutor Choi? Huh? Her mom is too calm! Maybe she's a stepmother. It doesn't usually go like this. You know I have a lot of experience in this field. They usually can't wait to get their hands on me. Maybe she's the second wife. Yes, that's it! Fighting over the family inheritance. You have no idea how a mother feels. Han Sookhui is suffering from this more than anyone else. Shejust has a different way of showing it. She knows sobbing won't solve any problems. As I told you already at the trial court, she was already dead when I went to the studio. That means the defendant saw HJ for the first time, then. You didn't know her? I told you already. To be accurate, you never saw HJ alive. Because she was already dead when you went in. How many times do I have to say it? I don't know that bitch. When I went in there, she was already dead! The prosecution calls the next witness. You are Choi Gyeongsook? Right? Yes, that's correct. I see that you are legally married to CJ. Right? Yes. Let me get straight to the point. Did CJ know HJ? Yes. Can you be more specific? He started selling her drugs two months ago. What kind of drugs? All sorts. Ecstasy, marijuana, phencyclidine... Where did he say he was going that night? He said he was going to collect money. From whom was he going to collect the money? He told me it was HJ. From the deposition, it is clear that CJ had known HJ before she died. That'll be all, your honor. Who brought in that bitch?? Why didn't you tell me you'd known HJ all along? Fuck, is it that important? I decide what's important or not. I asked you to tell me everything. She said she'd pay up. It's true. That's why I went there, but she was already dead. Was she really dead? Yes, I killed her. I got so horny that I wanted to do her. But she put up a fight. So I killed her. Is that what you wanted to hear? 300 thousand won? Yes, When the old lady dies, the insurance money goes to CJ, What if CJ dies? He is legally married to Choi Gyeongsook, Holy cow! Ms. Yoo Jiyeon, right? I had to look everywhere to deliver this package. Please sign here. Expect the real hand tomorrow, About CJ's woman, that Choi Gyeongsook, If CJ dies in prison, the insurance money for his mother goes to her, So that's why she testified, He started selling her drugs two months ago, Ecstasy, marijuana, phencyclidine, ,, She changed completely after meeting that asshole, She is an angel, I just felt good with her, Drug was found inside of HJ's mouth, called phencyclidine, A hallucinogen, also known as 'angel dust', But I had a feeling she was with him, The videotape of the funeral? Yes. I heard you took it. What do you want with it? Is my daughter's promiscuous life taped in there? I am still not positive whether CJ is the killer. That's not important! What's important is that you discredited my daughter! Thanks to you, she's become an object of ridicule. You said you had a daughter? Was that a lie, too? If you had one, you will know what's important to the dead girl. You'll know what it's like to have her buried in your heart. I feel your pain. I do. I thought... for your daughter... No, the only thought going through your mind right now is to watch that tape. I wish you were right. If CJ is innocent and there is another killer, then I'll hate you a little less. Gang Jiwon wasn't at the hospital that day. He had been in Seoul until HJ's funeral. What are you talking about? On August 19, 2007 Gang Jiwon was at the funeral. How do you know if he was in the hospital? Well, our records show that he was definitely in the hospital that day. We'd like to see Gang Jiwon first. That won't be possible. He was discharged. How can you discharge him in that condition? We have to do what the guardian requests. Who is his guardian? It is the hospital policy never to reveal personal information. Fuck! Who's the guardian that took Gang Jiwon out? Let me see the hospital records! If you want to see them, bring a warrant! Motherfucker! She's a part of it. She got him out after we left! All the records have been forged, too. Mr. What? You found it? Way to go! Okay! They found HJ's car! I'm going to the station to get a warrant and find out about Gang Jiwon. You go to the dump and ask for Mr. Looks like a piercing. Why is your friend so eager on this case? So are you. Why did Gang Jiwon say that to me at the hospital? Maybe he doesn't know what he's done. Phencyclidine, mescaline, they're similar to LSD. They're all hallucinogens. If you take it for too long, even a normal person hallucinates. But can't you still remember when you wake up? If you take phencyclidine for too long, you show symptoms of a schizophrenic. Even if he had torn someone apart, he may not realize what he has done. DNA analysis is almost over. But we need a sample from Gang Jiwon to crosscheck the results. I have a piece of paper at home with Gang Jiwon's blood on it. Blood? That should do it! What? I checked background on Gang Jiwon. You know Gang Sangman, the top dog at the Eastern Seoul Prosecutor's Office? That old man is Gang Jiwon's father, He had to hide his son to protect his career. That's why he rushed the trial. I have a bad feeling about this. Hello? Hello? Counsel! How have you been? What are you doing here? Excuse my intrusion. But what else could I do? I'm just a messenger. Gang Sangman put you up to this? Sorry, counsel. Yesterday's partner are today's enemies. Still feisty... Get me every account of insurance payout to a Jaguar owner from August 2, 2007. Isn't it obvious he called the insurance because of the the crash? Get back to me, motherfucker! Yes, officer! What? Someone came to see CJ? Yesterday? Yes, name. ChOOnggeun? Ms. Yoo. I believe my son has nothing to do with this case. That's why you forged the hospital records and got your boy out? Listen to me. He came back at dawn that day, still high. I told him to stay away from drugs. He was carrying a girl's body in the trunk of some car. Listen, this is very important, He doesn't remember anything, Not a single thing, When he woke up, the living room was a bloodbath, How fortunate, though. The killer was caught. I mean that CJ. Right now, Gang Jiwon is more likely the killer than CJ. That's why I'm here tonight! I know who willed HJ. Don't! No, no! Gang Jiwon might not be the killer. So, please... I'm running for an office in the next election. I'm going into politics. Whether he's the killer doesn't really matter. A scandal like this could end my career. You know what it's like. Show? I want you to put him on right now! Are you the stage designer? Hello? Come on, pick it up! Why is it off?? Anyway, we found the crash marks on HJ's car bumper. The tests show it was a Jaguar. The owner called the insurance on August 2, near HJ's studio! And the Jaguar owner is that fashion designer Bruce Jeong, The one who was hitting on you, with that VIP invitation to his show, He won't answer his phone, Usually, he's so sensitive during a show that he turns it off, Anyway, I've got some place to go, Why don't you go to the Continental Hotel? He probably saw the driver who was carrying HJ's body in the trunk, There's a witness? This is getting more complicated. By the way, counsel. Do you really think I'm innocent? Oops... Hello? Son of a bitch Captain I found him, I need backup. What? This is the real thing! Hello? Fuck, what am I? 'The boy Who Cried Wolf? 911? We have a burglar in the building. He's got knives and everything. Okay. They set the date for the last trial, When is it? Tomorrow morning, Everything has been taken care of. Choonggeun, you motherfucker! Where is Eunyoung, you motherfucker?! Answer me! Bastard! She's dead. I killed her. Fuck you! Hey! You fucker! Hey, you bastard! When the fuck did I call? What are you looking at? Find that bastard! He's still nearby. I'm a cop, you idiot. Hey! Wake up! Remember the accident at Ahyeon-dong about a month ago? That accident... It was my fault, but the manjust left. Remember that young man? With his nose pierced? - Pierced nose? - Think hard. I gave him my card. To call me if there was anything wrong with the car. Was that him? Yes. This is him. I'm positive. Mom! Mom! Eunyoungg! I had a visitor, so I had to cut off her finger, No, no! You have exactly twelve hours left, I can't wait any longer, Don't go in there! What about Bruce Jeong? No! Jiyeon... I said no. Don't go in there! What's going on? Please... Counsel. Thursday. They're both alive? I'm sorry. My boys seem to have made a mistake... No, it's probably for the best. We have witnesses now. By the way... when people get older, they get uglier. Take your ugly face out of this country today. Ha. Did Newspaperjust beat me? The footprints and fingerprints from the victim's studio, the fingerprints on HJ's wallet are indisputable evidence that the defendant CJ is indeed the one who murdered her. And his past records of rape, using women as a means of satisfying his sexual needs, is also a solid evidence of his motive. Did you meet Ms. Yoo, the counsel for the defendant, yesterday? What did you talk about? The prosecution's witness is a drug addict undergoing psychiatric therapy. He is unsuitable as a witness and his statements cannot be trusted. That's for me to decide. Continue. Let me ask one more time. What did you talk about? I know who killed HJ. Does the witness know who killed HJ? Is the killer in this courtroom? As you can see, the witness is a drug addict undergoing psychiatric therapy, just as the counsel said. The witness is not credible, and therefore any evidence gathered or statements made based on his interview with the counsel are not also credible. First of all, I stand in court today, relating to Mrs. Han - the mother of the victim. I cannot say I fully understand the agony of a mother who had lost her daughter, whose face had been too brutally disfigured to be even recognized. But I can say I am trying to understand her. And I do understand her. Get to the point, Counsel. As the prosecution asserts, the murderer of HJ is. CJ sitting right in front of me. Continue. As I said, according to my investigations, CJ killed HJ. However, at the time of the murder, there was someone else at the scene. For your reference, the defendant was supplying Gang Jiwon with drugs, Gang Jiwon had constantly been threatened by the defendant to pay off and the victim HJ promised the defendant she would pay her boyfriend's debt on the day of the murder. The typical disorganized crime. Hey, just once, huh? Eat it. And the typical organized crime. The counsel is merely conjecturing. There is no evidence that Gang Jiwon was at the scene. Right. There is no evidence to prove that. The statement I just made is merely a speculation, and I do not have conclusive evidence. But can the prosecution present the most decisive evidence, the murder weapon? In other words, the sculpting knife? Where is the murder weapon with CJ's fingerprints on it? In criminaljustice, the responsibility of proving the defendant guilty belongs to the prosecution. When a court of law finds a defendant guilty, it has to be based on credible evidence obtained through legal procedures. This is the very basis of criminal law. Whether it be deposition by the prosecution or the police, the defendant and his lawyer must acknowledge its contents to admit it as an evidence. The prosecution found no credible evidence that will prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. That evidence is the knife CJ used to kill HJ. The footprints and fingerprints cannot be the decisive evidence. Unless the prosecution finds the weapon with the defendant's fingerprint on it, the defendant cannot be proven guilty. In order to prove that CJ was innocent, the first thing I tried to find and destroy, the most damning evidence of all was the weapon. There is a witness who saw the defendant driving HJ's Avante on the night of the murder. The prosecution calls its last witness. Do you remember the accident with a red Avante about a month ago on August 2? Yes, I do. He had blood all over his body. Do you remember the driver? I gave him my card. If he's here, can you point him out for us? Ms Yoo, I believe my son has nothing to do with this case, What's your opinion? That's why you forged the hospital records and got your boy out? Listen to me, He came back at dawn that day, still high, He was carrying a girl's body in the trunk of some car, Listen, this is very important, He doesn't remember anything! Not a single thing, When he woke up, the living room was a bloodbath, I took care of the car and body, I didn't believe he'd done it, but he was at the scene, I told you. I never forget debt I owe. When people get older, they get uglier. Thanks. Why did you put the car back? The Jaguar ran into me, and there was a police roadblock not too far. Plus, Gang Jiwon was still at the studio. What did you do with the knife? I don't know. It kind of disappeared after I stabbed her. There it is! Over there! Eunyoung! Wake up, sweetie! Eunyoung. Let's go home, okay? Eunyoung! Eunyoung is alive! My baby... Eunyoung is alive! My baby, my baby's alive! Eunyoung! Mom! I'm here, baby. Eunyoung, mommy's here. Mommy! I did everything you told me to. The police? Probably lost on the express train to Busan. This is so fucking great! Cool cellphone, too! 4 -, motherfucker, talk properly! 20, 27. ChOOnggeun! Choonggeun! I'm back, babe. You know what I went through to get you out? Who are you?! I did an awful thing to that poor child, because of you, What's going on? The most painful way of dying is being burnt, That bitch!! What's going on? I just got out for fuck's sake! You don't even deserve hanging, You don't deserve it, Fuck. Was that you? I am really sorry. I sincerely apologize. No, it's me who should apologize. She is no longer a Thursday's child. She came back from afar. Mommy! Look!! They should be here in a minute. Will you be my lawyer? I'm just asking... You don't have to. Where is it! Get out of my way! Kim Yoon-jin, Kim Mi-sook Park Hee-soon. The voice of murder Kim Mi-sook
