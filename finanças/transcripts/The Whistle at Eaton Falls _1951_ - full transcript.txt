More than half the people of the USA live in small towns, places no larger than ours, Eaton Falls, New Hampshire. With most of us here in Eaton Falls, our ties are so strong we just couldn't be happy living any place else. But you never know how tightly chained you are to a town until real trouble sets in. Like that morning last fall when our whistle didn't blow. Why, as long as anyone could remember, that whistle marked the beginning and end of every working day. It was our curfew and our fire alarm. Why, we even set our clocks by it. Well, we soon found out the whistle was silent. The old Granite State Shoe Company had closed down. Closed down for good. And that meant a lotta folks had lost their jobs. Therefore, the court directs the sheriff of Rockingham County to sell the said property of the Granite State Shoe Company at public auction. This is now up for sale. What am I offered? I knew this would happen when those strangers bought the plant. What do they care about us? How can you keep 'em from carrying off the machines? Now they can open some place with cheap labor and no union. Sold one time. Sold two times. Sold three times. And sold to the First National Bank. That whistle had become a kind of symbol, I guess you'd call it, that everybody in town went by. So, it was shifted over to the only place left going, Doubleday Plastics. About 20 years ago, Dan Doubleday took over the empty textile mill for his new up and coming business; Turning out buttons, combs, toothbrush handles and a lot of other fancy things. Nobody knew what moving that whistle was going to mean. It was just the beginning to what you might call a drama of real life. And before it was over, every single person in Eaton Falls was a part of it. Especially Brad, Brad Adams, Chief of Machine Maintenance and President of the Plastics Workers Union. It began the last day of October, Halloween. Kinda funny that it should be Halloween. Good morning, boys. - Brad. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning, Mr. Doubleday. - Mornin', Miss Russell. Sit down. Brad, I want the union to know what we're up against. The company's headed for trouble. Miss Russell's just made up our quarterly statement. Business is way off. If this nose dive keeps up, we're going to bust wider than the Granite State Shoe Company. Why, what's happened? Every customer I talk with says the same thing, our prices are too high. And they can't come down until we lower our costs. We can do that by junking our old equipment, installing new molding machines, high speed, semi-automatic. Take a look, Brad. They'll boost production 30%. Don't know yet when we get delivery. But once they're here, we can meet competition. Abbie, Bill, come here. Ah, gee, this is terrific, Mr. Doubleday. The fellas in the shop are really gonna go for this layout. There's a catch to it, Brad. One man has to operate two machines. It means laying off half the men in the molding department. Hawkins and I have discussed every conceivable plan with the engineers. This is the only way we can stay in business. What happens to these men? Who's gonna pay their bills, feed their kids? Brad, I don't like this any better than you do, but we either install modern electric saving equipment or our competitors put us outta business. I can't buck the future, neither can you. But junking half the workers along with the old machines? Bill, this layoff won't last forever. If we're able to get new business, new business means more production and the men'll be hired back. It's just a matter of time. But time is one thing you can't pay back, Mr. Doubleday. If you lay these men off even for a few months they're sunk. And with so many out of work, somebody's bound to get the bright idea to lower wages. It's happened before, Mr. Hawkins. Not in my company, you know that. Won't you try to convince the men that we've got to do this? I can't very well convince them if I'm not convinced myself. Local 145 is supposed to protect all of its workers. The union can't oppose new equipment. Read your contract. I don't have to read it, I know it by heart. We don't have to argue with you. We can go right ahead... Oh, now, Hawkins. Only a scab would be run two machines for ya. Easy, Brad. Do you think for one minute that I'd hire scabs? You wouldn't want to, Mr. Doubleday, but you might have to. Think what would happen to us. Why, this layoff would split the union wide open. It could break us. Which is better, half of 'em working or the whole company bankrupt and everybody out of a job? Well, you'll have to figure other ways to cut your prices. Go without your profits for a while. You can stand the loss better than the men can. Our profits have gone right back into the business, and we've borrowed money besides. Look here, Brad. If the union will go along, you'll see more money and more jobs for everybody in town. That's a theory, Mr. Doubleday. And I won't let my men lose their jobs to prove a theory. Mary, can you spare Jean for a little bit? I got some new ideas we wanna work on at the shop. Sure. Ted, will you tell your sister there's a tall, skinny, ugly looking ghost waiting for her. Okay, Eddie. Look, Brad, if costs have to come down, let the union find ways. We're not dopes. There's not a single thing about running that plant that our people don't know. Suppose that 200 of us come up with ideas for saving a buck a week. Eddie. I've come to your rescue. Hey, my hair! What's the matter with your hair? It's beautiful. So, the trouble with the Doubleday products are they all lack imagination. Hey, lift up. Can't get much eye appeal outta combs and toothbrushes. Put your arm up. Yeah. That's pretty. Now stay just like that. Products oughta be jazzed up a little bit more, made a lot more dramatic. What Doubleday really needs is a high power idea man. That's me. Jean, couldn't you look more tropical? You know, gentle waves lapping at the rocks. You're in Bermuda. Bermuda my foot, I'm in Eaton Falls and there's a draft in here. Now, can't you hurry? Hey, that's it. Hawkins is right, you know? We can't stop 'em from bringing in that new stuff. Nobody wants to. But he can't make one man run two machines. As a matter of fact there's even gotta be an agreement before we work one. Mr. Doubleday should know what would happen to this town if he laid off half his men. Oh, I asked him to forget layoffs if we could show him other ways of cutting cost. What'd he say? He'd give me Hawkins' job if we could figure how to save 2,500 bucks a week. 2,500? Ah, the old man's got his troubles, Joe. You know, the Gibson Company is our biggest customer, takes more than half our output. They're not renewing their contract. Why, what happened? Our prices. Doubleday and the sales manager are flying to Cleveland tonight. Wish him luck. He's one of the first guys to be laid off. You got a good union fighting for you now. You know who this is? Could be my grownup daughter. You know, Mary and I are wondering whether we'll wind up with a Thomas Edison, Irving Berlin or a Fire Chief for a son-in-law. You'll get 'em all, and an industrial designer besides. Doubleday's plastic mermaids. Management, that's just a fancy name for bosses, and you can't change a boss anymore than you can change a mule. There's nothing wrong with us trying to help him. Look, Doubleday's out for every penny he can get. Just what do you think the union's for? To look out for the workers, get 'em fair pay, decent working conditions, job security. Then what business have you got asking us to worry about Doubleday's headaches? Because if he can't compete with other outfits, we're all washed up. Hawkins is getting a good, fat salary to look after those problems. If the factory don't make money that's his hard luck. You wouldn't last 10 minutes in a real union town. I was a boy scout once, but I grew up fast. Nah, don't tell me about management. Pretty? A fink in Seattle gave me that back in '45. That was a real fish fry. It started over layoffs. Brad says he won't stand for none here. I say Brad Adams ain't got it in him. Everybody knows he and old man Doubleday are palsy walsy. That stuff don't go. Maybe we oughta run you for union president at the next election. Yeah. Say, no kidding. You've made a lot of friends since you've been around here. You could sure dish it out to Doubleday okay. There's one thing for sure, you wouldn't catch me cow tailing to him. And I'll tell you something else. A labor leader don't belong in fancy pants at a gab fest. The company'll walk all over us if we just sit around and talk. Labor's gotta fight for every inch it gets. Fight or you don't eat. The new equipment should be ready in a few weeks. I'm going to tell Gibson that we'll cut our prices beginning tomorrow. And gamble on the union going along with you? We've never had labor trouble and I doubt we're going to now, provided we can keep Hawkins quiet. He hates unions and he doesn't care who knows it, but Brad sees what we're up against. He's asked everyone for suggestions on cutting costs. Well, you can't blame him for fighting layoffs. We don't want them either. There's George now. Good luck, darling. I know everything's going to work out just as you want. Good night, sweet. Hey, fellas! The new machines are here. Take a gander at the babies that are gonna put half of us on the bread line. Starvation Annie's, I call 'em. You mean one guy's gotta handle both of them? Brad says never. - Got the bugs out yet? - I think so. Okay, get 'em started. Hey, Joe. Start number two. Watch this. Nothing to it. Try it, Joe. No thanks, Mr. Hawkins. That's right, Joe. You're trying to get him to set a precedent. The union hasn't accepted these new machines yet. Read your contract. I'm making this a grievance. It's under protest, go ahead. Well, what are you waiting for? Okay, Joe. Start it. You're kiddin', aren't you, Mr. Hawkins? Mind your own business. Go find Brad. He's the man to decide. Operate that machine, London, or draw your pay. Okay, boys. Let's walk. Come on, Joe. You men, stay on your machines! Ah, come on, let's walk. What's the matter, fellas? Joe's been fired. Are we gonna lay down and walk all over us? Wait a minute, Brad's the head of Local 145. Pull that switch. - Come on, let's go. - Come on, let's walk. Yeah, we're walking. Hey, boys, they fired Joe London, we're walking. You stay here, Joe. Hey, fellas, come here. They fired Joe London, we're all walking out. - Who are they? - Hawkins. I'm going down to spread the message about what's- - Go. - Goin' on around here. - We're walking. - Why? Ask Al, he'll tell you what's going on. They fired Joe London, we're walking out. We're walking, are you coming with us or not? - What? - They fired Joe. Told everyone to pull their keys and walk. I ain't walking... It's unavailable. Hey, Bob, come here. We're walking out, they fired Joe London. Hawkins fired him for not running the new machine. - Are you with me? - Yeah! - All right, let's walk. - Come on! - Walk. - Walk! - Walk! - Walk! Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk. - Let's go! - Walk, walk, walk, walk! - Walk, walk! - You got no right - to simply walk out. - Walk, walk, walk. - Come on back, you fools. - Walk, walk, walk. - Go back to your machines. - Walk, walk, walk. - Come on! - Walk, walk, walk, walk. What's wrong with you? Hey, what's happening here? Oh, Hawkins fired me for refusing to work with them Starvation Annie's. - Fired you? - Yeah. Well, I'll talk to Mr. Hawkins. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Why are the rest of you fellas off the job? They wouldn't listen. I told 'em I'd take full responsibility. - Al's right! - No, no, he isn't. - Are you crazy? - It's the only way. Walk and call a strike. No, you listen, you'll wreck us. This is just what Hawkins wants. What are we, a sewing circle? We're not moving. If you stay out you'll break your contract and the union won't be able to do a thing about it. Come on, get back to your jobs. - Come on, fellas. - Come on, boys. I'll take care of this. I'll talk to Hawkins. - Come on. - That's it, fellas. You're chicken if you go back to work. Stay here! Quite acting like a hothead. Grow up, Al. I want Joe London hired back. Nothing doing, he disobeyed orders. The walkout's a violation of the union contract. It was a misunderstanding. They're all back now. I've got the right to fire every one of 'em. You better not try it, Mr. Hawkins. Let's stop kidding each other. Kidding? Four new machines will be ready next week. One man'll work two of 'em. That's final. Are you sure it's final? Okay, Mr. Hawkins, you want a fight you'll get it. - A good one. - Yeah? Why don't you and your union get wise to yourselves? I've been in touch with Mrs. Doubleday's lawyer, Dunbar. He wants the old lady to sell the plant. Kit and caboodle. If you fellas don't get in line I'll recommend it too. I've got a buyer. Is that a threat? Whoever buys can close the plant, wait till you're all down and out and then rehire on their own terms. Think it over, Adams. I don't have to think it over. But Helen, as your lawyer, I must urge you to sell the plant. Put the money into a trust fund that will provide you with a comfortable income. No, Horace. I might if someone in town could buy it, but we know that people from outside aren't interested in Eaton Falls. I am. Good for you, Mrs. Doubleday. I'm not worried about the future. With the money due to the bank and serious labor trouble on our hands, a strike mostly likely. This meeting was to discuss the appointment of a new president. Well, since you insist on holding on to the company, I guess Dwight Hawkins would be the logical candidate. He'll keep a firm hand on the labor force. I've worked closely with him for a long time, Mrs. Doubleday. You couldn't make a better choice. My choice for president is Brad Adams. Adams? Well, you can't be serious. Well, the union would like him of course, but he's completely unqualified; No managerial experience, no knowledge of finance. It's impossible. He'll need help, certainty. But he has you to guide him with finances. However, as you say, we do have a labor problem, and Brad is better equipped to handle that than anyone else. I think my husband would have agreed with me too. Mrs. Russell, would you ask Mr. Adams to come in? He's in the library. Helen, I want it clearly understood this is entirely on your own responsibility. Naturally, Horace. Good morning, Mrs. Doubleday. - You've met Mr. Dunbar. - Yes. Sit down. Brad, I'd like you to be the new president of Doubleday Plastics. President? Oh, Mrs. Doubleday, I... You really think that I'm qualified to run your business? You can learn and you're the one man the union trusts. You're putting me on the spot. How can I switch sides when I'm just getting ready to negotiate on the new equipment? It's either you or Dwight Hawkins. Hawkins? I want you because we need someone who understands our labor problem. But it may look as though I've sold out. And without the respect of the workers, I wouldn't be any use to the company. Well, will you give me 24 hours, Mrs. Doubleday? I'd like to talk it over with the union. Certainly, Brad. Well, now's your chance to be the kind of management that labor says it wants. You need to get some sleep. I'll be expected to do a lot of entertaining. We can get a new car now. Oh, Brad, Brad, you know that beautiful old house out on the edge of the river? It could be bought for practically nothing. Just wait a minute. - Not so fast. - Oh, why not? Oh, darling, I feel wonderful. Well, I'm scared stiff. That doesn't sound like you. Holy smokes, sweetheart. The head of Local 145 stepping into the boss' shoes. If I have to do something that's good for the company, the union'll say I've sold out. If I make a decision the boys would cheer about, Hawkins, Russell and Dunbar'll say the union's got me in its here pocket. Look, I'm not worried about this one one bit. Not one single bit. Does Mrs. Doubleday think we'll take the layoff if you're head of the company? I hope not. I've already told her that Joe has to be hired back. Thanks. She won't have no picnic. Right now you've got a lot of friends, and some of 'em just ain't happy unless they're battling with bosses. Don't make much difference to them whether the name's Adams or Hawkins. Oh, Brad, you've gotta take it. Doesn't he, fellas? Labor to management's a big jump, but I think you can make it. You can't blame me for wanting to try it. I'm for it. Second the motion. Oh, can't you just see him sitting there behind old Dan's desk? Right now I can hear Dan sayin', That old lady of mine, that Helen, by golly for 35 years she made me a mighty clever wife. Now who'd of thought she'd make a downside smarter with her? - Oh, congratulations. - Hi. Thank you. Hello, sweetheart, how are ya? - Bye. - Bye. Hey, Al, I uh- - After the whistle blows, mister. I got no time to talk to the boss outside of hours. Oh, Al, let's forget about what happened- - I'm forgetting nothing. In this game, you pick sides early and play on your own team. Anybody who changes is a traitor. Make way for the finishing department. Honker down. This curves right now ain't doin' it. Sit down. Morning', Chief. Brad, we all chipped in and bought something we think you'll need. Just like Mr. Doubleday's. Oh, read what it says, Brad. "To Brad Adams, from his devoted friends in Local 145." - Speech, speech. - Speech. - Speech. - Speech. Thank you, Abbie. All of you, thanks very much. I never thought I'd have a job that needed one of these. Oh, all big shots carry 'em. You can bring your lunch in it. It looks better than a dinner pale. Meet the Local's new president, Brad. Bill, congratulations. - Thanks. - He beat Al Webster - by a landslide. - Oh, yeah he did. I'm gonna need a lot of help on this job, Bill. I wanna form a labor management committee. You'll get the pick of the union. - Thanks. - You sure will. Hey, Brad. Are you gonna use the briefcase for other things besides sandwiches? Yeah, a couple of blackjacks. I may need 'em to beat a new contract out of the Gibson Company tomorrow. 'Atta boy, Chief. - Go get 'em. - Thanks, Bill. - Good look, Brad. - Come on, everybody. We'll all be rooting for you. - Congratulations, Brad. - Abbie, thanks. - Good morning. - Mr. Adams. Uh, the name's still Brad. Hey, why don't you sit down? This the report? Financial statements. They're a little technical. Thank you. Morning. I thought you'd like to put your initials on a few things. Hi. These are discharge notices. Sure. Some of the men in the molding department. Six new machines are ready, so three men have to go. Those men are staying and I'm hiring Joe London back. You think you can run this plant with men standing around getting paid for doing nothing? There are other ways of cutting costs. Did you look these over? Those dopey things? Soap's being wasted in the lavatories. Remove the pay stations so the girls won't fiddle away time on the telephone. Some of them are very good. How about this one? Grind scrap at the machines. A conveyor belt to the finishing department. What of it? Shows that everyone wants to help. Have you forgotten? You're not in Local 145 anymore. Meaning what? That being the patsy to a bunch of union men is no way to run a business. Before you fire me, buster, I quit. I got myself a good job with a real company yesterday. That suits me fine. Your check will be mailed to you. Have your fling, union boy. It won't last long. You'll never find anybody to fill his shoes. Yes, Mr. Adams? - Get me Jim Brewster. - Certainly. How do we stand with the bank? We owe them $150,000. - 150,000? - For the new machines, plus interest at 4%. A payment of 25,000 is due next month. If not met, the entire amount becomes payable at once. What do you suggest? Try to get an extension at the bank. - Congratulations, Brad. - Thanks, Jim. - You wanted to see me? - Yeah. Hawkins just resigned. - Well, that was quick. - Hey, Jim, you've always been a very good foreman. How'd you like to be our new production manager? Me take Hawkins' job? Well... Okay, sit down. We got a lotta work to do. You know, Glenn Sewell, the fella that put Martin Plastics on the map? Well, I heard of him. Well, Mrs. Doubleday suggested him for sales manager. Glenn Sewell? He's tops, but you can't get him. He wouldn't work for a small outfit. I hired him last night by phone. Now, I've cut the price to the bone, Mr. Gibson. You can't get a better finish at double the price. Can you tell me which one of these your company made? No. Why should we pay Doubleday more than we do other manufacturers? Would you if you were in my place? No. We're assembling television sets. I can buy these for less money than it would cost you to make 'em. Adams, I'll tell you just what I told Dan Doubleday. Get your new equipment operating efficiently. When your prices are down, we'll be able to do business again. - Hello, Brad. - How do you do? That's just like Dan's. Oh, yes, the union gave it to me. That's as of the 30th. Sales still falling. Costs up. Did you renew the Gibson account? No, sir, but we'll get somebody else. We've got to. I'll be frank, sir. We can't make the payment next month and still meet our payroll. So, you want an extension? Yes, sir. I'd like not to make any payments for the next three months. Well, after all, the bank's money is safe. The way I understand it, the machines are worth a lot more than the loan. I wish it were that simple, but it isn't. No? The money your company borrowed belongs to our depositors. If Doubleday should do a Granite State, the people in this town would start drawing out their savings. Business would drop to nothing and every merchant would go broke. Would you extend the loan if a man with more experience was in charge? We'll go along with you for 90 days. Thank you. If we don't start showing a profit by then, I'll resign. Sure glad you're here, Mr. Sewell. I found out at the Gibson Company that I'm no salesman. Selling can be an easy game, unless the other fellow rings the doorbell when you do, and offers the lady a brush at half your price. When I called you I didn't know this company would be fighting for its life. I hope you won't regret coming with us. Right now we have no business. Give me a quality product at a competitive price and I'll sell more than you can produce. These high speed machines will take care of that. We've only got six of 'em. It may be spring before they're all here. That's not too far away. A lot of Fridays between now and spring. And every Friday a payroll comes due. This is what I'm counting on. An invitation, a bid and a big order. Buttons for Navy uniforms. Doesn't take a sales manager to sell to the Navy. You're a low bidder or you're sunk. We'll be the low bidder. That's all there is to it. Well, we can't make these buttons for less than 45 cents a thousand. - Are you sure, Jim? - I am. 44.98 to be exact. And if you bid more than 47 you won't get it. Is that the correct time up there? We're opening our bids by it. Some outfits here I never expected. Look at 'em sweat it out. They trimming their bid? Probably. Is 47 as low as we can go? Can you knock off another penny? Not and pay off the bank loan. But you wanna get the plant running. Okay, make it 46. Here we go. Make it 45. Bid opening for invitation 102S-7842, plastic buttons. Hench and Lee, 48. Philadelphia Plastics, 48. Maybe I didn't have to take off that last one. Hutchins, 47. Doubleday, 45. Maryland, 46.5. How long does this last? Northern Industrial Chemical, 44.3. Let's go. Ajax, 45. Hello, Ruth. Hello, Mr. Sewell, how are you? What, I'm driving. Are you crazy, we can't afford a new car. Our car's in the garage getting a new clutch. They let me borrow this to meet you. I'm sorry. Guess you didn't get the Navy contracts? Let me off at the office. I've got a lot of work to do. Not tonight. You promised to go to the Granite State benefit. - I'll have to skip it. - You can't! Everybody's expecting you. Okay! Get down with me, folks. Get your longways sets in order. Think we sang all right? Oh, I don't know, I got sorta scared the last minute. Oh, me too. Hey, I almost forgot. What? Here. What's the occasion? Oh, just 'cause I love you. J.L. You like it? I was wondering what the consumer reaction was gonna be like. If this nosedive keeps up, we're going to bust wider than the Granite State Shoe Company. Our prices are too high and they can't come down until we lower our costs. This is the only way we can stay in business. I can't buck the future, neither can you. Cut prices, cut costs, cut, cut, cut. Brad? Brad, darling. Come on, fella, you need some sleep. Joe, our ideas, they're not enough. I know. You're up against it. Things look different I guess when you're on the other side of the fence. A lot of people are gonna get hurt. I've been thinking about you and Mary. It's not your fault. Last hired, first fired, that's labor's rule. Oh, no, Joe. Brad, there must be some other way. No. Old Dan was right. Brad's gotta layoff half the molders, don't you? Worse than that, Joe. The warehouse is jammed with stuff that we can't sell. We're losing money in everything that we make. I've gotta close down the plant and layoff everybody. Everybody? - Everybody. - For how long? For as long as it takes to turn our inventory into cash so that we make the payment on the loan. To get delivery on the rest of the new machines, and they're held up for motors, probably for a couple of months. Then we've gotta get enough new business to take care of our costs and meet the payroll. You can't buck the future. You've got to become a part of it. Send them in. Hello, Chief. The job seems to be agreeing with you. - Sit down. - Abbie, Pete. What's the news, Chief? Everyone here? Yeah, I think so. The management regrets to advise you that because of critical business conditions, all manufacturing activities are being suspended for an indefinite period. The plant will reopen as soon as the new machines ordered for the molding department are delivered and installed. This drastic action is necessary to protect not only the future of the company, but also the welfare of its employees. That's a lotta hooey. Bill. Mr. Doubleday only wanted to layoff half of us. You come along and throw us all out. Either we close down temporarily or for good. Why didn't you tell us this before? I made this decision at three o'clock this morning. Let's get outta here. I'm sure glad I don't have to live with your conscience, Mr. Adams. This is how Brad gives us a vote of confidence. First Granite State, now Doubleday. What do you say, Joe, Brad Adams still your best friend? He's a prince, ain't he? Bradford Adams, you're a hero. I just hope the credit company don't carry off my new Chevy before I can crash it into Brad's rear end. When all our bellies are empty, Brad'll have one man run three machines. Well, they wouldn't listen to me. I guess they see now Brad's just out to make a fast buck. Why don't the union do something before it's too late? You know if we stick together, Brad's racket'll blow up in his face. How's it going? Eddie, you'll have to look for another artist. Why, don't I pay you enough? No, I'm serious. With Pop laid off, Mom and I have to find jobs. Ah, don't be silly. It's not gonna be for long. We can't wait, honest. On the 15th, there's a payment for the house. Next, the oil burner and on the first, Pop's life insurance. Ah, if we could only hit the market with these babies. A cigarette lighter in every lamp's a wonderful idea. Yeah, kinda corny though. Doubleday's plastic mermaids. Now, that's really a hot number. Look, if you don't start doing something about selling these things, I will. We will never have that fortune you're always talking about unless we cash in on our creations. Ah, if you'd only run off a few thousand mermaids we coulda been out on the road now selling 'em. Might've helped some. Here. How many box tops do you have to send in for one of these? Oh, I'm sorry you don't like it. If Doubleday had anything half as good as this the town wouldn't be in the dumps now. Oh, Eddie, I didn't say that. Oh, I think it's swell. Premium houses'll really go for it. For prizes on giveaway programs. Well, that's not much of a compliment. Hey, hey, what's this? Oh, nothing special. No, what's it for? - Hey, Ruthie? - Hm? - Got a pie? - I got a cake. How many pieces you want? - Uh, seven. - Seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven pieces. Exactly equal and cut clean. Cutter, huh? A cutter that cuts clean. It's funny, I've been thinking about a cutter myself. You have? The trick is to be able to sell your stuff for less than the other fellas. Let me sleep on it tonight. I'll talk to you about it in the morning, huh? Okay. I tell you what. Get a hold of Jim Brewster and Ike Pinkery. Tell 'em to meet us at your shop first thing in the morning, say seven o'clock. Seven o'clock. See you then. - Night, Ruthie. - Bye. Thanks a lot. Morning, fellas. Before I explain why I asked you here, I want you all to give me your word that you won't talk. Certainly. I don't want any false hopes to build up around town and then bust 'em. Well, I'll go along. No one's ever been able to find a way to trim these sprues automatically, have they? We still have to do it by hand. Every company has tried to dope out an automatic cutter. Uh huh, so did we, but with a traveling slicer. Eddie's pie cutter started me thinking. I wonder what would happen if we built the cutter right into the mold. You know, a contraption like that gives me a mighty poisonous idea. What do you mean, Ike? I'll tell you. It could send every girl in the finishing department to the county poor house. That's where you're wrong, Ike. We'll be able to turn out stuff faster and cheaper than anyone else. Television parts, for instance. - Ike. - Yeah? We'd get enough new business for a second shift, and that'll mean everybody works. Automatic cutter, huh? That'll take a mighty doing. But good seed usually sprouts a rich harvest. Yeah. You don't need the money. Four, long. Two of your are right, gentlemen. I'm gonna need one bet. - You're on. - One bet here. Four or an eight, four or an eight. This brew gets worse and worse. Sure, it's absorbing your personality. With no paychecks to feed your kids, you crack wise. Paycheck, paycheck, you sound like my old lady. Yeah, can't blame her for throwing you out, losing all your unemployment dough on the whores. Want your puss slapped too? I, uh, I see it's about time for Doubleday's to open up. No kidding. How do you know? Just by looking at the two of you. You've touched bottom. So has the rest of the town. Now, all Brad's gotta do is go to the union and say take it or leave it. That guy's not gonna tell us where to get off. That's the beer talking. When Brad blows the whistle, you and all the others'll come on the run. Give me the thickness gauge. Oh, what's the hitch, what's the hitch? She's off three thousandths of an inch. Open it up, Eddie. You don't think we oughta try the jukes, huh? No, you'd smash the plate. You know, sometimes I think we got a big, fat goose egg here. Here. Tighten that lower bolt. All right, Eddie, close it up. It seems to do it. All right, Eddie, turn it on. All right, keep your fingers crossed. There's still something wrong. It's not cutting clean. Well, at least it doesn't jam anymore. Let's pull the mold up out again. By morning, we're gonna have this last bud licked. Morning? A lotta folks are climbing outta bed and thinking it's that now. South End, have to go. Somebody else trying to collect his insurance. Three of 'em landed in the county jail this week for trying that. Yeah, I tell ya we're in a race with the devil. And if folks don't start drawing wages pretty soon, old lucifer is going to take over this town. Well, I'm hungry. Let's get some breakfast. After that, Brad, we'll help you find that confounded bug. Those are the very terms you told Mr. Doubleday the union would never agree to. Yes, you've heard it before, but you do it this way or the plant folds for good. What about those men who will still be on the streets? - The other half? - Unemployment money doesn't exactly nourish the soul. - We've found that out. - Abbie, if the union will agree to one man at two machines, I hope, and it's still just a hope, that it won't be long before everyone's back on the payroll. Yeah, it's just a matter of time. We've heard that one too. Bill, the people in this town are so badly off, they'd take any offer that's made to them. Why don't you admit it? I don't know what you're aiming at, but you haven't been able to bust the union yet. You think I've been trying to? Well, do you? I took this job with the union's blessing. And what said then still goes. I want a company where the workers will prosper with the management. What you don't know is that I promised myself I'd quit if I couldn't find a way to keep the other half working. If I don't succeed I'll be without a job too. Our policy is still the one you set. One man to a machine. Brad, we can't talk for the union. There has to be a vote. What are you grinning at? Every one clean as a pickerel's tooth. How do you like 'em, Brad? We did it, huh? We finally did it! We licked it! Well. Well, I guess I oughta treat you guys to something special. A honeymoon in Bermuda. You're entitled to it. I'll settle for a ride down to Portsmouth and a lobster dinner. Okay, Ike. I'd just like a long, cool glass of beer. Anything you want, boys. Anything you want. We have all our new equipment and the union's voting next Sunday. I like your plan, Brad. Now it's up to Mr. Sewell. Does that mean you approve? Of course it does. Got a whole new line of merchandise for you to sell, TV parts, bushings, channel selectors. I want orders for a million of these units before we reopen, and that may be next Monday. Now, wait a minute. Look what we're able to sell 'em for. But a million? It'll take me a month to see enough customers to ring up that much business. Mr. Sewell, wouldn't it be easier to find us one big customer? You wanted a quality product for a competitive price, didn't you? Now you've got it. Very few outfits'll buy in the millions. I could put in a call for Ted Wagner in St. Louis. He's the head of the National Company. Get to St Louis as fast as you can. These prices are sure on the low side. How can you do it? It's still a secret. Has to be until we find out about the patents. But you can't promise deliveries until you hear from the union. Will you please let me do the worrying? I want an order for one million units before we reopen next Monday. I'll try to catch the last plane. If it should take Sewell a month, you stand to lose the plant, your home, everything. And if he's successful. Well, that's another story. But I want you to realize, Mrs. Doubleday, just how a big a gamble you're letting me take. How soon can you start deliveries? 10 days. We're way behind, Philco, Dumont, RCA, must be six million units on order there. Oh, excuse me, Dad. The production chief wants to see you for a minute. We have a new plant, but it'll be months before we can get in the equipment. I'll be right back. All right. How long are you staying in town? Long enough to get that business. I think you should try to buyout Doubleday Plastics. What on earth would we do with a factory in New Hampshire? They're installing a lot of new molding machines. We could rip them out and put them in our new factory. I'd rather give them our business. Their prices are just about what it costs us to manufacture. You know why? These things weren't cut by hand. You mean an automatic cutter? Absolutely. Look here, smooth. We've spent a fortune trying to develop something like that. Mr. Wagner, I'm sure we could buy Doubledays. Patents, new machines, everything. They'd be fools to sell. I understand the new management is causing a lot of unhappiness around town. The lawyers have always been after Mrs. Doubleday to sell. If they'd rather sell than have our business, I'll make them a good offer. Let me go up there and scout around. I'd like you stall off Sewell on our orders for a few days. Be just as well if no one got wind of our plans, especially about taking away the machines. I couldn't take an offer like this to Mrs. Doubleday. It'd be different if the plant were on the market. I remember not so long ago you were urging her to get rid of the place. Yes, but that's when we seemed to be facing difficulties. The Boston Trust Company seems to think you still are. Their money's on deposit. Just waiting for the due date. But your labor troubles are still with you. Well, that's why we put Adams in there. You know that if anyone can handle a union, he's the boy. Then, we can't get together? No, Dwight. Certainly not with an offer like this. You know, Dunbar's a cagey old cuss. He wouldn't go to Mrs. Doubleday with such an offer. Bet he had her on the phone before I was outta the building. Don't misjudge Yankee shrewdness, Dwight. You may find you can't pay what he'll want. I'm prepared to raise my offer. Just to be working with you again is worth something. You don't fool me, Dwight. Why after all these months of complete silence you suddenly come back? You guess. - Good morning, Horace. - Good morning, Helen. - Good morning, Miss Russell. - Good morning. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. Helen, I'm rather pleased with myself, and I want you to know how helpful Miss Russell's been. Dwight Hawkins came into my office this morning. $400,000 he'll give us. That's more than double his first offer. Good heavens, Horace. Who's putting up all that money? Well, I haven't asked him. But I checked, the cash is in Boston. It's yours when we sign. I presume Dwight Hawkins will be in charge of the plant? - Probably. - Uh, if the sale goes through he wants me to continue as treasurer. Until Brad comes to me and admits failure- - Helen, if you have any further labor trouble, you won't get enough for the plant to pay your debts. You may thank Mr. Hawkins, but tell him I don't care to sell. Well, I'll tell him you need more time to consider. You know, your predators to force you to sell. Horace, if this is a bonafide offer, a few days delay won't make any difference. I have complete confidence in Brad. - Mr. Hawkins. - Hello, Al. Your message sorta surprised me. Brought you some news. I hope it's good. We've got enough of the other kind. I came up here with the dough to buyout Doubleday. Very interesting. When we take over the plant and we're going to, there'll be jobs for everyone. So, lets me and you start off by understanding each other. How do you mean? Old lady Doubleday thinks the union will do whatever Brad says. She won't sell until she finds out differently. You oughta know how to handle this situation. You want all the men back on the job. I'm in a position to do it if the union turns down Brad's proposition. There's not much time. We're voting Sunday afternoon. That's why I'd like you to get busy. 200 signatures demanding that. Mrs. Doubleday sell her business. And I'd wager that there's not one of these people who knows what he's signing. Who originated this petition? Look here, Sewell. Tell Wagner that National either signs now or we're going after someone else. I don't care how much business he's talking about, it'll be no good to us unless we get it now. Well, you're darn tooting I'm impatient. Okay, so long and good luck to you. - Brad? - Yeah? Could you take an hour to go over these with me at the house? The contractor wants to start working the 15th. The 15th? You'll have to put him off a little longer. Look who's coming. Our ex-boss, Mr. Bradford Adams. Let's give it to 'em. Come on, boys. Would you look at that. What do you say, Jack, 5% of his windshield. How's that pretty boy? Can you see us out here in the front line- - How's that big fat paycheck? What's the matter, can't you take it anymore? Come on back here. Tonight's the most important meeting we've ever had, but a lot of 'em won't go. Crap game means more to them then the voting. People are saying things can't be any worse, why worry about who's boss? Mary, what do you say to our packing up and moving to where I can get steady work? Joe! Good jobs are going begging in places like Pittsburgh, Detroit, Los Angeles. Leave Eaton Falls and all our friends? Take the kids out of school? We wouldn't be happy living anywhere else. That's just why we don't want an outsider running Doubledays. Most folks here are like us, natives, they own property, have mortgages. Let's admit it, we're tied to this town. We can't escape, we're prisoners. I keep asking myself why Hawkins wants the plant. One thing I'm sure of, if he gets it he'll make us work at his terms. He'll move the machinery to some town that's worse off than ours. If the union votes yes, half of you will still be outta work. Vote no, the old lady'll have to sell, then we know we'll go back. - All right. - Yeah. Come on, all of you, you'll be late for the meeting. Get away, you're a jinx. Just started, come on, let's go. Outta here, Joe, before you're throwed out. Look, we got a good union. This is our last chance to have good management. What do we care? Bosses are all alike. Ah, come on up and vote. You'll be playing with bottle caps. That unemployment money can't last much longer. Mr. Hawkins is gonna see us through. Aw, look, fellas. Are you all right, Joe? Yeah. Now, why'd you have to hit him? You might say history is repeating itself. We've gotten together today to deal with another Benedict Arnold. And the funny thing is he's got the same initials, B.A., Brad Adams is a traitor of Eaton Falls. He's right! Order, order, order, order! This is before the union is to hear the report of the executive committee and vote on it. - Go ahead, Al. - I demand the point of personal privilege. And I'm gonna keep it anyway. Is there anyone who hasn't heard Brad Adams say no layoffs? That he'd fight and die to keep one man to a machine? He's right! All right, all right. What'd he do? - What'd he do? - He sold us out! That's right. Order, order! Quiet, quiet! A speaker's out of order and a sergeant in arms will remove that man from this meeting. Nobody's removing anybody until I'm finished. What'd he do? He sells out. And with the blood money, he buys himself a new house. He's gotta live in style while the rest of us starve! That's right! We're all starving! - Who's working, no one! - Shut up, you guys, shut up. - And you know it! - You're crazy. That's not so. They've given us the house and once more, Brad cut his salary the day the plant closed. We gotta stick together. Either none of us goes back or we all go back! - Right. - Right. Wait a minute! I say let Doubleday make jobs and pay half of us out of its profits. Isn't it better for half of us to have a job then for all of us to starve? Folks, folks, Brad's doing all he can to take everybody back. When he took this job, we all gave him a present. And it said, "to Brad Adams, from his devoted friends in 145." Tell us what Brad's been giving you, junior. I'll knock your teeth out... Hey, hey, hey. Well, we're supposed to vote. That's what the meeting is for. Quiet, please, quiet, quiet. I'm sorry to say that brother Joe London has met with a serious accident. What's happened? Nobody knows yet. He was taken out of the river below the falls. I guess we're ready for the vote. No, we aren't. I say let's postpone the meeting till next week. Then we can vote on Mr. Hawkins's proposition. I say we vote now. We know Hawkins isn't buying the place because he loves us. The chair recognizes Brother Ike. In case some of these Johnny-come-lately's don't know it, I was the first person of this Local. Yes sir, some of us old timers went up to Boston to get the charter from the International. Ah, sit down, you old goat. Just a minute, squirt. Now, I've been around a good bit. And I generally size up the bait before hooking on, and I'm holding with Brad because he's just doing what old Dan woulda had to do anyhow. - Oh, that's telling, Ike. - Talking about right here. Let's vote. Hold it. It's been moved and seconded. All those in favor of going back to work, signify by saying aye. Aye! - Oppose? - No! The aye's have it. Yeah, well just try and make it stick! Al Webster says that the whole thing is just a stunt to make labor look bad. Anything to say? How about you, Dr. Payson? I have a statement to make. The death of Joe London is needless, tragic waste. Tell your readers that the same violence and confusion that killed Joe London can destroy this town. So far, only one we can prosecute is the fella who threw the bottle. I'd better have a squad of men outside the factory just in case there's trouble. Thanks, Captain, I'd rather you didn't. I'll call you if we need help. Okay, we can get here in a jiffy. You've sent for me? Yes, I did. Have you seen Dwight Hawkins lately? My personal life is none of your business. Mr. Hawkins happens to be a very dear friend of mine. I understand he's trying to buy this place. Well that's no secret. He's dealing legitimately with Mrs. Doubleday's lawyer. You'd like him to get it, wouldn't you? Yes, certainly. I've even urged Mrs. Doubleday to sell. - Why does he want it? - Ask him. I don't need to. He's production manager for National Company. They were ready to give us a big order until he came into the picture. I know nothing about any order. But you do know that he's here in town organizing a campaign against me, don't you? And he's trying to corrupt the union. I hold your friend Hawkins responsible for Joe London's death. Don't you dare say that! You've wrecked this town. And unless Mrs. Doubleday sells she'll be penniless. I'm quitting. I'm doing just what Dwight did, union boy. Only now, you've had your fling and it didn't last long. Did it? Operator, long distance please. I wanna talk to Mr. Ted Wagner, President of the National Company in St. Louis. What do you say, Bill? I never crashed a picket line in my life and I never will. But this ain't picketing, it's wildcatting. They're a bunch of goons trying to wreck their own union. - Let's go. - Come on! Duck down and hold tight. Hey, wait, wait. This is no ride for a lady. Mr. Wagner? This is Brad Adams speaking, Doubleday Plastics. You better send for your production manager before he gets run outta town. Yes, I mean Hawkins. This company is not for sale, Wagner. No, not at any price. No! You can all go home now. We've been home long enough. Why can't we work? Why? You see why. They brought in scabs. - That's a lie! - Yeah? Who do you suppose is running those machines? Who, the president of our union, that's who! What's the matter with you people? Look, we voted didn't we? Are you gonna let this hooligan wreck our union? Nobody's going to work until the old lady gets rid of your hero. Webster, I know all the words and if I wasn't a lady you'd be hearing them now. Hello? Who? Yes, it is, Mr. Wagner. I told Sewell to call on other customers. Yes, those prices still stand, but we'll have to have a deposit. Yes, I'd be glad to. Just a moment. All right, what's your order? You will give us the whole lot? Yes, at the price that Sewell quoted. Will you send us a check for 30% with the order? All right, thank you, Mr. Wagner. Goodbye. Yahoo! National Company, six million TV channel selectors. R-U-S-H, rush! Get me Mrs. Doubleday. Get me my wife and I wanna see everyone, everybody! Isn't there a man here with guts enough to follow me? Come on! Mrs. Doubleday, I wanna read you something. Come on, let's start our jobs. Come on. - Good to see you. - Hey, same here. Yes, Ruth. Of course it's true, darling! Yes, they're coming in now. So long. Come on in, everybody. Come on. Quiet, listen, listen, everybody. - Everybody's here. - And we're all ready to go back to work again. Everybody? You don't mean that do you? All those you need on the new machines. Are you willing to go to work in a night shift, Abbie? - What? - We're working at night? The layoffs are over. There will be jobs for everybody. Starting right now, Doubleday Plastics will work around the clock. Three shifts! Eight million? Well, that's what happened in our town, and it's happened in a lot of other towns too. With us here in Eaton Falls, thank the good lord, it turned out just fine.
