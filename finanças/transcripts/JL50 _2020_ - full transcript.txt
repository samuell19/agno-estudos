Pass.. This way. Give it.. Pass! Pass! Pass. This way. Come on. Shoot this way. This way. This way. Okay. - "People will say something or other.." - Amazing. - "It's the job of people to say.." - Very good, very good! Wait. Please let me sing.. Unnecessary disturbing in between. - Come on, sing. - Yes. - "Forget all those useless things.." - Very good, very good! Amazing! Done. Done. Thank God! No one has respect for an artist. - Okay, it's time to change the singer. - No, no.. - "Forget all those useless things.." - Enough! Enough! - Good night! - Good night! Good night! "We're lost in these colourful moments." At least say, 'Good night!' Good night! And, happy birthday.. It's not my birthday, it's your wife's. Oh, yes.. - "Happy birthday.." - Don't you feel shame? Let's go now. - Don't let him drive. - No, no.. I'll drive. No! No, I can drive. I can drive. You can drive, but today I'll drive. Please, allow me. Thank you! And thank you very much for the surprise party. It's not my idea but this idiot's, but you are very welcome. - And happy birthday again. - Thank you so much. - Good night. - Good night. - Did you saw? - Yes, I did! Let's go. - Hey, wait.. my wife.. - Let's go. 'The whereabouts of missing flight 'AO 26' are still unknown.' 'The Aviation Ministry..' '..has assured the family members of the passengers onboard..' '..that the location of 'AO 26' will soon be found.' 'The whereabouts of missing flight 'AO 26' are still unknown.' 'The Aviation Ministry has assured..' "The tears on your lips." "Makes me want to ask what's missing." "Why the branches don't shed leaves?" "Or why the lines of destiny.." - "..can't be erased." - Yes, tell me. I am just leaving. - I am leaving. Bye. - "Can't be erased." "Can't be erased." "Can't be erased." "Yes, it's me.." "Just me.." Is boss inside? He is waiting for you. Friday we have to meet Shriparna, I hope you remember? Yes, I remember. If you don't come Maitri will be upset, I'm telling you. 40 passengers, and eight important delegates. There's a lot of pressure. It must have crashed somewhere. What can we do? Look! We have information that 125km from Bagdogra. Some villagers have reported a plane crash. This is not the location of the flight, this is off route. This flight has been found where it shouldn't be. Has any other flight been reported missing? This is the only flight missing Shantanu. Maybe the plane was hijacked? There are some very important people on this flight. Finding flight 'AO 26' there, something's not right. - You should leave today. - Yes. Give me the Home Ministry please. Yes, sir. Sir, the chopper will be here any minute now. We are trying our best. Sir! Sir! Over. - Hi! - Hello, I'm Shantanu. And this is my colleague Gaurongo. - Hello! - Hi! - He's from CBI. - Yes, of course. I was told that you were going to come here. I hope you didn't have any difficulty finding the place? No..absolutely not. So any progress? This crash has taken place on top of a hill and so the rescue is slow. We have discovered 7 dead so far. Any survivors? Because of the impact the cockpit separated.. ..and stayed on the hill.. There are two survivors, but they are in critical conditions. One of them is a pilot. And the rest of the plane fell between the mountain.. ..and is completely burnt. There is no chance of survivors. One of them is a pilot? So you mean to say that the other survivor is not the pilot? Someone from the crew then? Well from the clothes is seems like a civilian, passenger. Maybe. What was a passenger doing in the cockpit? Can we see the crash site? Sure. Come with me, I'll take you there. Okay. I am sorry, I forgot to mention something important. This is not the plane that you are looking for. What do you mean? I mean, this plane is not 'AO 26'. Please, come. My work is just like my wife. There is no excitement. What did we come looking for? And what did we find? We should have a good looking girl by our side.. ..and our cases should be like Hollywood. If this flight is not 'AO 26', what flight is this? Bihu. How's breakfast? It's good. So how long will you be like this? Lots of things happen in life.. ..but it doesn't stop. Do you think, we are happy looking at you like this. Your dad's blood pressure is high these days. Mom, I am okay. Please. I slept really late last night, and I am tired, that's all. Your dad have talked with Mr. Mukherjee and his family. They are coming with his son for lunch on Sunday. I am getting late. It's time for my flight. At least let me finish what I am saying. Mother, I have a flight on Sunday. Time! My grandfather used to tell me, Time never stops. Time keeps moving. But after devoting my life to Physics.. ..I have realized he is wrong. Actually time never moves. Time is always present. Time's still, time is now. Sir, the principal has called you to his office. Das come in, meet them. He is Mr. Shantanu, a CBI officer. - I am sorry.. - And he is his colleague, Mr. Gaurongo. Hi! Nice to meet you. Pleasure meeting you. - They wanted to ask you something. - Of course. We have gone to your house, but found out you were here. Yes, sometimes I come here to give a lecture. You went to my house. CBI? Actually, I'm a little confused. What possibly can I do for you? Actually, we are here regarding a plane crash.. ..we want to talk to you about. I think your mistaken. I have only bought a flight ticket once in my life.. ..and that too a very long time ago. But. Actually, I have a phobia of flying. The plane that we have found.. ..took off from Kolkata 35 years ago and then went missing. The Plane went missing 35 years ago and you just found it? In India everything is slow. This plane crashed only last week. Now the question is, where was this plane for the past 35 years? I think you are at the wrong place. I don't think I am of any help? I have records.. ..that show you have bought a ticket for this flight.. ..but you did not board it. Why? I have a phobia, remember I just told you? Look I can understand that you have lot's to find out. But I don't think I can help you. And now if you'll excuse me, my students are waiting for me. Yes of course. - Thank you. - Thank you. Professor? Can you tell me why your were going to board this flight? It's been 35 many years. I don't remember anything. One more thing. Don't let anyone know about this conversation. Otherwise you could be in a lot of trouble. This is a matter of national security. I hope you understand. - Thank you! - Thank you. Have a nice day, Professor. Not even one body has been recovered in good condition. They are all terribly burnt. What is the condition of the survivors? Both stable, but not conscious. Can I see them? Not yet! I just want to see them. I mean no trouble. Due to the impact, he is still in shock. It will take time for him to regain consciousness. Though most of the injuries are internal.. ..but he's out of danger. Please, don't touch him. What are you doing? I cannot allow this, please leave. Can I see the other survivor? As soon as the patient regains consciousness I will call you myself. - Okay? Excuse me, please. - Of course. ABA claimed the highjack 'AO 26'.. ..and have asked for the release of their leader, Partho Mojumdar.. ..who is on death row. - Must look at this. - What is this? This tattoo is the sign ABA. 'Azad Bangla Association, whose only aim is to separate Bengal from INDIA.' 'We have just got the news that ABA claimed the highjack 'AO 26'..' '..and have asked for the release of their leader, Partho Mojumdar.' 'For further information let's go to our correspondent Rajesh.' The question here is about two planes, not one. 'AO 26' which has been hijacked. And the other that crashed in the lake.. ..and the government is telling us nothing about. Yes, Gaurongo. Yes, I am coming, right now. Hey, Shantanu! This is our neighbour, Mr. Chatterjee. - Hello! - Yes. - Shantanu! - Hello! Shriparna! Okay, Shriparna! Please sit. I am sorry to interrupt your party. No, sir. Actually, I have come with an old colleague for dinner.. ..than I saw Gaurango.. ..and thought I would chat for a bit. It's a pleasure to meet you. Nice. Thank you. Shantanu, tell me something. Other than investigation what else do you do? I mean any hobbies? Not hobbies, talk about skills. - What? - Yes. Like me, he can cook, he do his own clothes. In short your wife will be very happy. Just like your's. Come on, eat. Your growing your beard? No, just trying out a new look. I am moving to Bombay. Bombay, what are you going to do there? I applied for an advertising job. They're giving me a good package. I thought I should ask you as well. What there's to ask? It's been months since we spoke. You know what, I think you should go. It's good. At least you'll enjoy what you do. Just like you enjoy what you do. I can't. You've always been looking for something. That's your only interest. Not interest, but habit. What are you looking for Shantanu? I think we should go inside, they must be waiting for us. Bihu, how are you feeling? Better. Bihu? How do you know my name? Your badge shows it. I guess JL 50 you were flying it? Yes. How did this plane crash? We took everyday as normal at 3pm. And for ten minutes, everything was normal. Then suddenly.. ..a man came in the cockpit.. ..and stabbed Abhijeet. Abhijeet! My co-pilot. Then a second person came inside. And the first one took Abhijeet outside. Until now I had understood.. ..that our plane's been hijacked. He asked me to change the direction of the flight.. ..then moments later we came across bad weather.. ..because of Heavy turbulence the plane went out of control.. ..and I think we crashed. I have four questions for you. Where did this plane take off from? And where were you taking it? What's your real name and how are you connected with ABA? Are you mad? My name is Bihu Ghosh. The pilot for JL 50 who took off from Calcutta. The last time this flight took off from Calcutta was 35 years ago. What is the date today? I said what is the date today? 3rd August, 2019. What are you lying to me? I know this is 1984. Hey, what is going on? What are you doing, Shantanu? I told you she is still in shock. Please leave. Come on. When can I go home? When you answer all of my questions. Sir, a plane crash was reported near Neora valley.. ..and as per our sources it was a passenger plane. Is there something the government is trying to hide? Look I have already clarified that it was a cargo plane. So why hasn't the press been allowed to visit the crash site? Sir ABA has given on 10 days time for the release of their leader.. ..otherwise they will kill all the passengers. Please ask the home ministry. I am not the right person. Sir otherwise they will kill all the passengers. - Sir! - Sir! Please! The government is going to have to release him. They don't have any other option. You tell me where you have reached Shantanu? What we have found from the flight is 35 years old.. ..all the dead bodies are all burnt.. ..but definitely not the same people from 35 years ago. What about the survivors? Did you get something from the pilot woman? She has not fully recovered yet, we cannot interrogate her. But she must have said something? Sir, she says she is the JL 50 pilot.. ..who flew it 35 years ago from Kolkata. - Really? - Yes. Don't have you the original pilot's photo? I have requested a photograph from aviation.. ..but it will take time. But I don't think that the photograph will help us. She is saying her name is Bihu Ghosh. Her name matches the originally pilot.. ..but if she's the original pilot she should be around 60 years old.. ..and clearly she is no older than 25 or 30. She is lying sir. Is this some kind of setup? Look, I think there is a big game behind this. Anyway, do what you need to, but we need more details. - Please! - Yes, sir. Here are some of the things that we have recovered in good condition. These are some ID's which 35 years old. It's of those people who sat on the original flight 35 years ago. The radio is of a make 35 years ago. As per the reports, the food is of the same day as the crash. - Hotel Blu Star! - Yes. This hotel only use to supply the food 35 years ago. So we got a lead from this hotel. This hotel shut down 12 years ago! Where were these food boxes made? I will find out. Shantanu, have you thought about this.. ..over the entire flight not one trace of a cell phone. Maybe the woman isn't lying? This flight has been completely recreated after a lot of research. Everything is identical, but not original, including the pilot. This is definitely a setup, we just have to find out why. But everything the woman has told us matches the pilot's original profile. Profiles can be stolen. This woman is putting on an act. 4:30pm. No, it will not get late. You just come on time and everything else will be okay. Okay, okay.. What happened? What's that? What's what? That in your hand? Are you crazy? It's a mobile. What are you looking at? Those cars? You've never seen cars? I haven't seen cars like this. Time for your medicine. Tea!

"..or have you gone mad." - Yes? - Hello. Hello. My name is Gaurango. He's my colleague from CBI. We are from CBI, we want to ask you some questions. Baapi's dad! What did you do? CBI is here! Why did you have to act smart, saying CBI? It just came out. - Yes? Tell me. - Hello. This is Mr. Gosh's house right? No! My name is Bose. Mr. Gosh used to live here, who had a daughter.. a pilot? For the last 10 years we have been living here. Before that, I don't know. Is there anyone around who could tell us more? Nearby? Across the street Dr. Saab lives.. ..and his family has been here for a really long time. Maybe he can tell you something? His name? Name? Dr. Vikram.. Chakroborty. Vikram Chakroborty. Okay, thank you. Let's go. Bye. After that plane incident Mr. Gosh and his wife left the house.. ..and we never heard anything since.. ..not even if they are still alive or not.. Do try the biscuits, we make it at home. Thank you. Dr, are there any relatives of Mr. Ghosh that you can tell me about? Its been so many years.. ..I can barely remember their faces properly. Bihu must have been your age, can you tell us anything about her? She was very open minded.. ..and had a baby as well but we heard it was still born. Baby? According to our records she wasn't married! Exactly, that's what I just said, she was very open minded. She was not married. Just shut up. You'd say anything. She was in a relationship. The guy was from the army. They were going to get married. But he was killed in an encounter with naxalites, sad. Doctor, how was she to look at? What? Height, complexion, etc? Get the old album from the other room. - Which one? - The old one. Go My sister and Bihu used to dance together during a festival. I think I have a photo. What happened? Did you find it? Bring it. Is this the one? Yes, yes. Here take a look. This is my sister and this is Bihu. You're lucky. I've only one picture of her. Which we found now. Goodbye. Goodbye. Doctor, Bihu's child? Was it a boy or a girl? Mr. Gosh didn't tell anyone about that. Thank you. Could that girl be telling the truth? I don't think you heard, Bihu had given birth to a baby. But the baby was born still. Did anyone see that? You mean the Doctor is lying to us? I don't know. It is possible the baby did not die.. ..and it was spread that it did because she wasn't married. Look Goaurongo, say the baby was born still. But it is possible two people can look quite similar. Don't believe me do you? Come to my house tomorrow, my milk man looks exactly like you. Okay, tell me what next? Let's go to the hospital and check their status. Fine. Doctor.. What happened? I can't breathe. Wait a minute. Nurse. Take him to the doctor immediately. Come on. We'll take you to the doctor. Yes, to the doctor. Nurse, if someone is very ill or injured where do you keep them? 2nd floor, ICU ward! Where else, why do you ask? If I get really sick at night.. You don't have to worry. Wear this mask. Lift your head slightly. Now get some sleep. Goodnight. Yeah, I am trying to figure my life up. Nevertheless, good to have you back. Like you said. Amit. - Hey..get out. - How can you come inside? What are you doing? - Come outside. - Okay. Okay. Come on. - Tell me what to do. - Don't do anything stupid. Rewind. Don't move. Don't move. - Tell me what to do. - Don't do anything stupid. What are you doing? Hey girl, do as he says. Okay. Please. Look at this. We've to head in this direction. I want you to change the direction. - Do it now. - Okay, okay. Sir for a long time there's no activity.. ..then at the end there's something here. 'We are seconds away.' Is this the last recording? Yes, this is the last. What time is noted for this recording? Sir..28th August, 1984. 4:30pm. How is this possible? Are you sure this is the last recording.? Sir, I am very sure. Is it possible that the blackbox has been tampered with? No, not possible, sir. But If the FDR circuit breaker has been pulled.. ..because of power cut, the recording can be stopped. So is it possible that the FDR circuit was pulled.. ..and nothing recorded after that? In the case of this flight it is possible.. ..because it is an old model plane.. ..and the circuit can be pulled disabling recording. So if we imagine that the circuit breaker's been pulled out.. ..then maybe the recorder was turned off. Thank you. Please give me a copy of this recording. Sure. - And can you give us a minute. - Sure, sir. So this is certain that 35 years ago this flight was highjacked.. ..and the FDR power was cut disabling recording. We didn't find anything concrete other than a name from the recording. Chandra was definitely involved in the highjacking. I don't know about the people who sat on this flight 35 years ago.. ..but the highjackers might be alive. Chandra might give us a lead. Identify the passengers by the name of Chandra. I will go to the central jail. Okay. Where am I? Yes tell me. - Yeah, Gaurango. - Shantanu. In the list I only found one man with the name Chandra. Really? Okay, I'll call you later. Sir. Let's go. Partho Mojumdar! I'm Shantanu, from CBI.. How are you? Don't waste your time.. ..just tell me what you are here for. What can you tell me about JL 50? Why do you think I am going to tell you anything? I know that you're behind the disappearance of JL 50. You know it right. What are you going to do? After 3 days you have to release me.. ..then I will come back for my revenge for each hit. Tomorrow our forces are going to surprise ambush the plane.. ..and you will be hanged until death. You are lying. You know that you are lying. That plane has important people on it. Yes. Your going to have to release me. Where did you hide this plane for 35 years? What is the deal with all this drama? I told you.. ..your wasting your time. Mr. Shantanu, can you please step out for a moment. I cannot allow you more than this. I just need 10 more minutes. I had to do a lot to get permission for this. Look, he is not less than any VIP.. ..and if something happens to him it will come down on all of us. I had orders for only 5 minutes. Please. Nothing can be done now. It's done now. Hold his hand. Doctor. We should celebrate this moment. We need to celebrate this moment. - Hold him! - This calls for a celebration.. I thought you would take me to a special place. This place is special. Why do you come here Shantanu? I come here to find answers whenever there is a question in my heart. Did you get your answer then? When is your flight? You know what? Some questions in life have no answers. My flight is early, I should go. Bye. Yes. Okay. Okay, sir. There was a phone call from the hospital.. ..and the other survivor has regained consciousness.. ..but we can talk to him for 10 days because he is unstable. There was no one by the name of Chandra on the list. Of course. We will receive the DNA reports from the bodies in a few days. That's not going to help.. ..who are we going to match the DNA reports with.. ..we don't even know whose bodies these are. The people who sat on the flight years ago. These are not the same people. It's not possible. Body count exactly matches this 35 year old list. Men women children, everyone is the same. Even to agree, it is impossible.. ..to rule out the potential of these people.. ..being the original people from 35 years ago. Lets say, even if there is a chance to find their DNA.. ..we will have to the homes of these people.. ..what are we going to say to their families.. ..your missing loved ones have landed? This is a bloody top govt secret investigation. Sorry, I have to take this. Hello! Yes, tell me. Yes. Indrani.. Shriparna I Banerjee. I for Indrani.. yes. Whose phone call was that, I hope everything is okay? The divorce Lawyer called. Some confusion about the middle name. - Come on. - What happened? What are you searching for? Look at this B.C. Mitra. Whoever this kerchief belongs to was on the flight, correct. Yes. Mitra. Biswajit Mitra. B for Biswajit and Mitra same. Then what is C? - Chandra! - Yes. Middle name. You mean Hollywood twist? Shantanu, Biswajit Mitra is Biswajit Chandra Mitra. Chandra Mitra, was an integral part.. ..of the Kolkata of Physics science centre. He was an important man. A man of a communist thought process.. ..who took part in a lot of protests against the government. Yes? - Greetings. - Greetings. My name is Dibakar. I am here from the Astronomical part of the science centre. Yes, tell me? Actually, next week we are presenting an exhibit on Indian science history.. ..and would like to display some work of Prof Mitra. Can I get something written to make part of the exhibit.. Look I only have a few files, other than.. If you don't mind, can I see those files? Are all these books yours? No, no. These are all my father's books. I hate reading. - Professor Mitra was your.. - He was my father. Here you go. Thank God, I'm not a scientist. So, what do you do? Actually, quite the opposite. I am an artist. A scientist is also an artist. Yes, you're right. After all we're also creators. Yes. You take a look at these files while I prepare tea. - Thank you. - Okay. The tea is ready in 2 minutes. Actually, some other time as I have to leave. I will take this and drop it back next week? Okay then, when you come back then we will sit. Sure. Thank you. Your welcome. That's my dad! When was this taken? Right before he left. This is his last photo. Eat some food. If you don't eat how will you be okay. Only two of you survived. You're lucky. Who is the other one? Help me.. Help me.. Help me.. Get back! Get back! - Relax. - Relax? I don't have time to relax. Don't do this. Let her go. I can't let her go. - Look, we can talk. - Is it? There's nothing to talk. Move away. Just stay there. Who are you? Now that's a nice question. Keep guessing. Darling.. Wait. Wardboy. Where's the security? Security. They were here a minute ago. Follow that ambulance. Come on. Hurry up. Be quick. Come on. Take left. He is taking left. Hurry up. Fast! Keep the change. Move. [Regional song] [Regional song] [Regional song] [Regional song] [Regional song] Yes, tell me. The police is on high alert. He will captive soon. Okay, listen. I have talked to Dr. Bishwa in Kolkata Science Centre. He tells so much stories. But you will get all the information about Project A. To understand project A we will have to go back to 263 BC. Emperor Ashoka, after seeing many dead bodies after the Kalinga war. He realized that science, politics.. ..and technology was being misused in war. That is why he picked.. ..the 9 most knowledgeable people from the world of.. ..politics, warfare and science and created a secret society. Their knowledge was divided into 9 different books. And it was decided that these books.. ..would always remain a secret so that this knowledge.. ..doesn't get into the wrong hands. Of the 9 books the first book.. ..was about propaganda and phycological warfare. The most dangerous.. How to influence the thought process of people to rule them. Today as well.. ..through media and press this method is used to rule over people. The second book.. ..was about how you can kill a man just by touching him. They say some pages of this book were leaked into the hands of people.. ..and this is how martial arts was born. The 3rd book, was about all sorts of communications. Communications with people from within earth and beyond this earth as well. Yes, in fact in one of the books there were instructions on how to make a UFO. You can name them as UFO or Flying Saucer. The kinds that are being spotted numerous times around the world today. The nine books spoke about nine different topics. And one of them was about time travel. - Time travel? - Yes. You're right. Time travel. During excavations the British found some pages of this book.. ..and brought together a group of scientists to further research on them. This research drug was named Project Ashoka. In fact, in short Project A. But nothing really came out of this project.. ..and many years ago it was shut down. is time travel possible? Only in books. To travel time, man needs to move at the speed of light. And the amount of energy needed to do that is not available on this planet. 1 trillion electrowatts, can you imagine? This is just a waste of time. Professor Biswajit Mitra, how was he connected to Project A? He used to work here for sure. But never shared a lot with anyone. However, Professor Das can tell you more about him. - You mean professor Shubrato Das? - Yes. Professor of physics? Not physics, quantum physics, the study of space time. Das assisted Prof Mitra for a few years.. ..and was also a close confidant to him. Professor! You lied to me Professor Das. Yes. If I spoke truth, you wouldn't believe it. How was Professor Mitra connected with Project A? Professor Mitra's father Dr. Debochandra Mitra was a part of Project A. After Indian independence the government stopped the funding.. ..and this group got dissolved. But Dr. Mitra continued his research independently. After him, his son BC Mitra.. ..continued his research and finally broke the code. - Broke the code? - Yes. You mean he made a time machine? No, he found it. Professor, I don't have time for this nonsense. I know 35 years ago he hijacked this flight. I also know that this hijacking is being staged like a time travel. And they got this idea from this Project A. I just want to know.. ..that why is it being staged like this? Shantanu, it's not being staged. This is time travel. I can explain. Come! Come, please sit. Shantanu, sit. Many scientists including Einstein have proven.. ..that time and space are the same thing. Space time is like this piece of paper. But it is not empty. Look, the earth is not hanging in mid air. But is set on this time space. Lets take for instance that this paper is a piece of time space. Then this is past and that is future. Because of earth's rotation and revolution.. ..there are folds that have been created around this time space. Like this. Now to get from this past to this future we have two ways. One from here, like we all travel through time daily. And the other one.. Allow me. One minute. Like this. Look, the space time around our earth.. ..has many folds like this. And many holes like this exist between them. That can take us to the future or past in very little time. We call these wormholes. To put it differently, these are doorways.. ..through which we can travel through time. The pages that the British found during excavation.. ..had some incomplete formulas on them. If they are solved, we would find some readings. With the help of these readings and a topo sheet.. ..the exact location of these worm holes can be determined. Project A was looking for these doors. And Mitra solved the formula.. ..and broke the code of Time travel. - Fascinating. - Yes. This is not the answer to my question professor. I'm coming to that. Look, Professor Mitra was a genius person. And also very lucky. He inherited everything from his father. Everything. Money, fame, and also Project A. Project A was the only goal in his life. He used to be stuck in his formulas all day. Nothing else mattered to him, including his family. He was a crazy man. They say Mitra had a brain of gold and heart of stone. He worked day and night to complete this formula. He struggled a lot but only got disappointment on his hands. That day when I went to meet professor Mitra.. ..he was going crazy with excitement. He had broken the code. - And was convinced he could time travel now. - 'I did it.' 'Oh, my God! I did it.' 'Das, I did it. I broke the code.' 'Yes, I broke the code.' 'It's time for celebration. Don't stand here like morons.' 'Das, I can do anything now.' 'I can do anything now.' 'Thank you very much.' 'Oh, my darling..' 'I am conqueror. A great conqueror.' 'Look at this. Das, look at this.' But he needed a plane for the experiment. Prof Mitra and myself were supposed to fly to Madras for a conference. And he decided to use that very plane for his experiment. He wanted to make big impact. For Prof Mitra this was not a problem. Apart from being communist minded, he was also a member of ABA. Within ABA, aside from Doctors and scientists.. ..there were also people like Partho Mojumdar.. ..and he is the one who provided men to Professor Mitra.. ..for the highjacking of JL 50. Because I knew that this flight.. ..was going to be highjacked I got really scared.. ..and therefore didn't board the flight. So you knew that this plane was going to be missing for 35 years. No! No! No! According to his calculations.. ..the plane was supposed to return in 35 hours. He misread his own calculations.. ..and it returned after 35 years instead. Professor, your story is really interesting.. ..but it is just a story. I know it is very difficult to believe. At first I didn't believe it either. In fact for last 35 years I have been thinking that this experiment was a lie. But then when you came to meet me I was shocked. I visited the crash site as well to confirm.. ..that you are not lying to me. I still did not believe it. So I followed you to the hospital. And Shantanu when I saw Prof Mitra lying on that bed with my own eyes.. ..I was flabbergasted and in shock. Oh, my God! He looked exactly the same as he was 35 years ago. If this is not time travel then what is it? So you mean that the person on the hospital bed is Prof Mitra? Yes. Absolutely! Professor Das, without permission from me you cannot leave this city. - Got it? - Yes. Shantanu! Professor Mitra came here last night to meet me.. ..after running away from the hospital. 'Sir!' 'I have finally realized the dream that I saw so many years ago.' 'I can't tell you how happy I am today.' 'I feel like the most powerful man on earth.' 'Sir, a lot of innocent people lost their lives on that plane.' 'Hey, I could have lost mine as well.' 'Das, I could have lost mine as well.' 'Sacrifices for the greater good.' 'But that pilot woman has to die as she knows the way to the wormhole.' 'Sir, you can't just kill someone.' 'I can do anything now, Das.' 'I will come to see you again..' '..but I have to go meet Partho Mojumdar first.' - 'Bye. - But sir.' 'Partho Mojumdar is in jail.' 'He will be released in 3 days.' 'I have read the newspaper, Das.' Shantanu, it is extremely important that Prof Mitra is caught. In the next 48 hours Partho Mojumdar will be released.. ..and if the two of them meet.. ..you can't even imagine what will happen. You only have 48 hours.. ..to catch Prof Mitra and that is impossible. It's impossible. Impossible. But there is one way out.. ..we can go to 1984 ourselves.. ..and stop them both.. ..and if we do that.. ..then JL50 would never crash. AO26 would never get highjacked. ABA would be finished even before it starts. And this knowledge would be safe from getting in the wrong hands. You don't believe me. Yes. You don't believe me, Shanatanu. Look, if something like this was to happen in America.. ..it would be a phenomena. There would be researches on possibility theories. But If it happens in India it is just a story isn't it? You know Shantanu, what the problem with our country is? In our country.. ..we just never try to get beyond.. ..Hindu, Muslim, Temple, Mosque, Politics and blind faith. If we see something in the sky.. ..we just fold our hands in front of it and call it God. But we never try to ask questions like why what and how. Never. Shantanu, why don't you believe it? Prof Mitra looks exactly the same as he did 35 years ago. If that this in not time travel, then what is it? Okay. Can you prove that this in not time travel? Can you prove that this is time travel? Yes, I can. I need 1 hour from your 48 hours. Please, Shantanu. He's on the line with us. 'Rajeev, tell me what is the situation?' 'Barkha, there is no official statement from the home minister.' 'But it for sure that in next 48 years..' '..the government will have to free Partho Mojumdar.' Special helpline services for the family of the passengers. Gaurongo.. We need the readings of that exact location from you.. ..that Prof Mitra told you during the highjack. Why? Bihu! Bihu, it's very important for us to fly to that location. But why? I.. I promise I will you. But we don't have time now, right? On one condition. I will fly. That's not possible. Then I am sorry. I don't remember. Please Shantanu. it's Just a matter of 1 hour. Your work will be also done and we will create history! I mean correct it. Please.. Shantanu! Everything is ready. Okay! Bring it back properly. Because if not then even after.. ..selling my house I won't be able to pay for it. Sir! I think she will be okay to fly this plane. - Yes. - Where is Das? He is waiting at the plane. - Shall we? - Okay. And listen, do one thing for sure. If you reach there, then disappear my mother-in-law. Shut up. [Radio chatter with control tower] VTEF to ETC request and start. [Radio chatter with control tower] VTEF to ETC ready to take off. [Radio chatter with control tower] [Radio chatter with control tower] Taking off in 30 seconds. [Radio chatter with control tower] [Radio chatter with control tower] [Radio chatter with control tower] Do you miss your child? Are you asking me out of concern.. ..or do you still not believe that I'm the real Bihu Ghosh? Even if I answer that, is your answer going to change? My baby was born dead. Do you remember exactly what time.. ..your plane reached the point Prof Mitra told you? It was 4:30 pm. Remember, whatever we have to do, we have to do before 4:30 pm. If JL 50 is highjacked.. ..nothing will change in the future. And if the high jacking is stopped, then what? Then exactly at 4:30 pm we will all be where we are supposed to. If JL 50 was never highjacked it would have never crashed. Then why would we even come here. And if you still don't get it, you will. In one minute, we will be reaching the point. Please hold tight. This doesn't look good. Because of you I almost lost my life. Idiot! There's no reception in the phone Shantanu. We made it. Your one hour is up Das. Now move. Shantanu..no phone reception, try to understand. Professor, we have landed outside of Kolkata.. ..and no reception is normal here. Now do as I say. "No one stop my heart's flight.." "..there goes my heart." "I want to live again." "The Prime Minister of the country Mrs. Indira Gandhi.. ..made a proposal for the country's diplomatic relationships. 'For that can't we make an agreement..' '..of friendship, of help, and of peace.' 'So that was our Prime Minister..' '..Shrimati Indira Gandhi addressing the parliament.' 'Now let's start the Rock N Roll hour on Calcutta's favourite station.' 'This one is for all the rebels out there..enjoy.' Yes. We made it. And we are not dead. "Come on..amidst the questions.." "..we'll find.." "..all the signs." Come on..amidst the starts.." "..we'll find.." "..the same old dawn." "Now I am here and breathing." "Now I am here and screaming." "Now I am here and breathing." "Now I am here and breathing." "Now I am here and screaming." "Now I am here and breathing." "It's a game of the heart and mind you'll never get your hands on it again." "Is Time is like sand or will it stop like water." "It's a game of the heart and mind you'll never get your hands on it again." "Is Time is like sand or will it stop like water." Brother.. Can I borrow that paper for a minute? 19th August 1984. Shantanu, we don't have a lot of time. JL 50 will fly tomorrow. Thank you. Where to? - Chowrangee. - No no, Ballygunge. 40 cents. What's this? I don't have any change. Get down of the bus. - But why? - Get down. Stop here. Get down now. Get down now. Giving me fake money? Let's go. Shantanu, the was no 10 rupee coin in 1984. I know that. I want to go home, Chowrangee. If you want to go somewhere else then just go. - Bihu, you can't go home. - Why? Because your already at home. What do you mean? Look, JL 50 has not flown yet. And until it does you are already at home. If people see two of you that could be a problem. Everything will be ruined. Please. So I can never go home? No. Don't worry. Tomorrow at 4:30 pm you will be home. Believe me. Until then where do we go? How will we go? We have no money. Let's go sell this. - Yes. - Let's go. Let's go. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Excuse me, sir. Date, please.. What's the date today? 19th August 1984. - Sir it's 19th August 1984. - Yes. Thank you, sir. You check in I have some work to do. Where did he go? I don't know. Excuse me? Someone drop a baby here today? Not yet! Think about it again. 15 days he has been with me. Do you think it is easy for me to do this? She is going to be home today.. ..and I cannot keep him any longer. Excuse me, who are you? Whose child it is? - Yes, tell me? - Move. Let me go. Quickly take the car out. Hurry up. Just outside this city is an old warehouse. Very old warehouse. Before going to airport Professor Mitra will be meeting Partho Mojumdar. From there he will leave for the airport.. ..along with the hijackers. We will stop them right there before they leave. How do you know he will be meeting Partho there? Instructions. You see, I had instructions. That after college, me at 22 years.. ..will go there to pick up his car. We will need a car? Yes. I can arrange the car. How? For that I'll have to go home. It's risky. You can't go home. A lot of people have lost their lives once because of me. I can't let that happen again. It's my duty. Bihu? Where are you going? Mom! And what are you wearing? Trisha's car broke down. I am lending her mine. Okay. Mom! I will be back very soon. Mom! Who was it, mom? Let's go. Start the car. Hurry up. Let's go. Let's go. Yes. Hey look, Professor Mitra. He owns this car. - So shall we go? - Okay. You stay right here. How did you know that your baby was born dead? Did you see him? Hey Shantanu, what shall we do? Yes.. - These people will go with you. - Okay. And take care of everything. Thank you, Partho. Thank you, very much. Okay. You just come back successful because if you are we will win. Absolutely. There's no chance of failure. Future is ours. We'll create history together. I don't think so. Who are you people? Sir! It's me, Das. What? Get out. Hurry up. Come on. Get out. Who are they? You go. Get me out of here. Kill them. Partho! Chandra sir. Who are you? Who are you? Hey! Rascal! Partho! Who are you? Who are you? Rascal! The formula is definitely inside this. But I don't know the code. I have a solution. Just step back a little. What are you doing Shantanu? I don't think anyone should have these. You can't do this? What are you doing? Look Shantanu, I strived my entire life for this formula. You cannot let you burn it. Give me the formula. Don't be stupid Professor. Look Shantanu, I didn't come here to help you. I came for the formula. Give me the formula. What's the use even if I was to give this to you? At 4:30 pm all of this is going to be over and you won't have any time. Neither JL50 will be hijacked and nor we will come here. Is it? You're very smart Shantunu, but you're not a scientist. I am going to come here at 5 pm today. Let me explain myself. Me at 22 years old will come here.. ..to pick Professor Mitra's car These papers will be right here, and I will have the formula. - Give me the gun, Professor. - Shantanu, stop. I will fire. I don't believe that you'll shoot me. If I can shoot Professor Mitra twice then why can't I kill you? I don't get it. Shantanu, I lied to you. It true that Mitra came to meet me, but he didn't left. I tortured him for the formula, but he died. Yes. Dead! Poor Genius.. Then I was thinking about getting this formula. But the next you came to me on your own. I apologize, Shantanu. But I have only used you to come here. No.. Don't get me wrong. It's not that, that I can't crack this code. I can crack the code. If I had money.. ..and like Mitra I too had gone to London for studies. So you see.. ..I don't have any other way. This is the only way. So give me those papers. - Give mt gun professor. - Give me those papers, or I'll shoot.. - Give me the gun Professor. - Shantanu.. 'At 4:30 pm we will all be where we are supposed to.' 'Did you get your answer then?' 'What are you finding, Shantanu?' 'Shantanu, your mom is here to take you.' 'Shantanu, your mom is here to take you.' Where is my child? Sorry, dear. Doctors couldn't save the baby. Shantanu! Shantanu! Wake up. We are about to land. What happened? Nothing. 'Flight AO 26 will land in the next 5 minutes..' '..at Kolkata's Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose airport.' 'Please fasten your seat belts. Thank you.' Yes, I have just landed. Yes. Yes, I have taken your mother's medicine. Yes. Okay. Sorry. Yes, I am coming. - I will reach home. - Okay. Shantanu, why do you look so upset? It's such a special day for you. Please smile. - Let's go? - Yes. Let's go. Shantanu. Your mom is here to take you. Shantanu, your mom is here to take you. I'll be there. Thank you. - Here you go. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Do you remember, I came to take you from here today? I was five years old yet I remember. - Like it was yesterday. - Thank you. What were you doing there by the bench? I was just thinking that if grandma never told you about me.. ..and you had never come to get me, then what would it be like? - Son, what's the point of thinking.. - Thank you. ..about something that never happened? Take it. - Thank you. - Take. For you. Thank you. Okay. - Who's left? - Here you go. - Thank you. - Welcome. This one. Hi! - Thank you. - Welcome. "Hope to find a home in a snap!"
