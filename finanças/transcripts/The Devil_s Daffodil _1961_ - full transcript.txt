Special edition! Daffodil killer strikes again! Special edition! Special edition! Scotland Yard, please. Hello? Hello? Attention, attention! Global Airways is now announcing the arrival of the flight 246 from Hong Kong. - Shall I open it, Mr. Tarling? - Yes, please. We promptly stopped everything when we got your telegram from Hong Kong. Hm, good. Who else knows about it? Nobody outside of this room. And the are all addressed to Lyne? Lyne & Co, Chinese-Imports, London. - Heroin! - You were right, Mr. Tarling. - When did the package arrive? - 3 days ago from Hong Kong. A parcel. And nobody from Lyne came to pick it up? - No. - Keep everything under lock. Who is there? - Smith! Mr. Tarlings car is here. - I'm coming. Mr. Tarling is coming... - See you soon. And thanks for the car. - I didn't call a car. - You? - Smith! Did something fall down? - Ling Chu! What are you doing here? - Greeting a high official, who is also a friend, meaning: Combining business and pleasure. - What's going on here? - Something ended up in smoke. Lyne & Co, Chinese In-and Export. Good morning. - These daffodils don't smell. May I? - Don't you like them? Now, when there are real ones? Why would someone import fake ones? - Mr. Tarling, I'm just employed here. - But not for very long, eh? Matter of opinion. Apparently many things changed here, since the old man is dead. For example this room here. Presumably the atmosphere too. May I ask, how you mean that? In other words, I mean: Ray, He can't possible change so suddenly? As I said, I'm just employed here. May I help you with something else? Yes. Tell me your name, Anne Rider. Is that all? No. Something else... Do you know this? "To: Min Ho, Hong Kong. Request urgent repeat order plastic flowers shipment by Global Airways. Repeating: Urgent! Lyne, London." - Yes, I've seen it. - The shipment is here for 3 days. If it was so urgent, why wasn't something done, to collect them? To collect what? The daffodils, Mr. Lyne. - Who posted this? - I don't know. Ask Mr. Milburgh, My dear Tarling, let me know, when you come to England! I would have arranged a big welcoming party. I've had that. With fireworks. So? C'mon in! - Tarling. - How is going, Milburgh? I didn't post it. There is no carbon copy in the correspondence. - Why do you know that? - It is my job to know that. - But Miss Rider remembered it. - There... she has to be mistaken. - The post office too? - Is it that important? - Possible. - Maybe Baker knows something. - Baker didn't come in this morning. - Who is Baker? My head clerk. He shall come to me as soon as he is here. Yes? - A call for Mr. Tarling. - For you, Tarling. Thanks. Yes? Mr. Tarling, a gent wants to talk to you. His name is Ling Chu. I'll put you through. - Anne, what are you looking for? - The telegram. - The telegram never existed. - But it was here. Anne! I'll be back. If you should find out anything about the telegram. Then, call me please, at the Brunswick Hotel. - Maisie, call Mr. Baker at home. - I already tried. No response. Try it again, Maisie. There is a old Chinese proverb: No jetsam without flotsam. - Old? You just made that up. - Of course, The main occupation of the Chinese is to find old Chinese proverbs. - Do you know who that is? - No but I know who he was. Baker, head clerk at the company Lyne. Someone's in a blue funk. There is another Chinese proverb. Yes, save that one for Scotland Yard, they want to laugh too. To come to business, Tarling. You wish insight into the daffodils murder file. Why? Ling Chu belongs to my drug department in Hong Kong. He thinks, he has found a lead. And why did you never get in touch with the police? Talk is silver, silence is golden, Sir Archibald. Sir, when dealing with drugs... in such an extent the amount earned goes into millions. - Even police officers get bribe-able. - In Hong Kong maybe, - but not in London. I hope. - An old Chinese proverb says: Hope is the earning of innocence. Suspicion is the punishment of experience. We won't come far with your Chinese double-dealing, Ling. Would Sir Archibald like a more modern wording better? - Best we stay focused. - Yes, and the matter is, that all these girls were killed, after Ling Chu talked with them, - Do you know senior Inspector Whiteside? - Whiteside? - No, why? - He works on this case. Talk with him. You'll reach him at the Cosmos Club. Why Cosmos Club, if I may ask? Because all these girls worked there. And each girl was there at the night they died. In there, inspector. Mademoiselle Gloria currently rehearses here new act. - Hands off, Trudy! - I wanted to change your flowers. - Take care of your own work. - But this is my job. - Shall I keep them or throw away? - Neither. - What shall I do then? - You ask too much. Are you looking for somebody? Yes, Inspector Whiteside. Is he here? - Yes, in there. - Thanks. Yes, she was here. Alone? - This sort of girls are never alone. - Well then: Who was with her? I said, I couldn't remember. Why do you ask just me? - Do you know him? - Why? - Please wait in your wardrobe. - Why? I've told you what I know! Do what he says, sweetie, it's best not to tangle with them. - Yes? - Jack Tarling, security service at Global Airways. The commissar sent me to you. - Why? - We shall work on the case together. I see. - Hello? - It's me, Putek. Tarling is here. - Who? - Tarling! He is in the club... and talks with Inspector Whiteside. I thought it would be important to you. - Trudy, where are... - Katia! What are you doing here? - The police are here! - The police? - Is that all? - Isn't it enough? 1. Heroin in daffodils-stipes. 2. Ling Chu questions the girls. And 3. Daffodils on the corpses. Why doesn't your Chinese tell me of that, if he knows so much? I'm sorry. Ling Chu has his achievements, but his own working methods. What does that mean, own working methods? We are in England, we are not in Hong Kong. I still assert that the culprit is a crazy sexual offender! But why? 1. Three girls with mannequin-figure, means sex! 2. Three girls killed with the same knife, means murder! 3. Three corpses with daffodils, that's madness! You have told me, your Mr. Ling Chu is on the lead of gang of drug dealers. Of course he has talked with over 100 girls! All from the type, who run into ruin. Very well. Assuming there is a connection. - What would you like me to do? - Keep me informed. - I'll do the Same for you. - Is that really necessary? Pardon! If I get something out of Lyne, I'll make sure you're informed. Tarling... I know, it's a hard nut to crack, hm? Block all exits, nobody leaves the house! - Pardon! - Who are you? - Trudy Mahler. I work here. - What happened? The cat knocked the vase over. That shocked me! A shock? Come with me. I have to talk to you, - About what? - Murder. We have an old proverb: The English brought 3 benefits to China. Irish gin, Scottish whiskey and the English tailoring. Did anyone leave the house on this side? I don't know. I was in Puteks office. - There I found this. - Have you looked for this? No. I was looking for the address of a girl named Katia. Oh... her? - Yes. Is she dead? - It was a close call. Oh, I ask for... Hello, Tarling! You are everywhere, aren't you? Hello. - Do you buy all your stuff here? - Oh, only in case of need. - Poor Baker. Have you heard? - I have. Now we don't get to know anything about the telegram, eh? Tarling, come visit me. You are welcome at any time. - That's very kind. - Gentleman! Anne? What's wrong? Do you still think about the poor Baker? The telephone, Mr. Lyne. My friends call me Ray, Anne. Would you like to have dinner together? - I'm sorry, I have an appointment. - Tomorrow? Shall I answer, Mr. Lyne? Anne, you have no heart at all, though it is the most gorgeous spring! - He doesn't pick up the receiver. - Never mind. I know the way anyway. Mr. Tarling, please! You can't go in there without registration! - Oh! - What do you want? Didn't you tell me, that I would be welcome at anytime? - Can I go now? - For the moment yes. Wait a sec, Miss Rider. Do you know by now who sent the telegram? That's all! Tarling, you've already been told, that Miss Rider was mistaken. She has never seen the telegram. Why did Tarling come back? He is still looking for that telegram. Doesn't he believe, that Baker mailed it? Oliver... why did Baker kill himself? I... I don't know. And why is the telegram so important? It's obvious, Baker was involved into some drug dealing affair. In doing so he used the good name of company as a disguise. Does your company still have this good name? - Yes? - Charles brought Mr. Keene. He'll wait. Where are you going? - I have to talk to Miss Rider. - That's completely needless. Tarling, come, come! Sit down. I want you - to meet Peter Keene. - Peter Keene, who is that? His father was a commander in my squadron, in the second World War. But he was shot down and since then I've taken care of Peter. But he got into bad company, he lost his way. Debts, - unfunded cheques, black market... - Lovely! Yes, yes, Poor fellow. He was a good for nothing. - Wasn't even a good criminal. - Like who for example? Let Mr, Keene come in. All friends of his father have slammed the door in his face, only I did not. - Morning, Ray. - Hello, Peter. If I ever exit a train and your car is not standing there, - I know what's going on. - You talk to much, Peter. You embarrass Mr. Tarling. Mr. Tarling is a friend of the company, who thinks my dad is a saint and I am a monster. Have you ever been in a dilemma? Like really down the drain? There you get to know your friends. Looking good! How were the holidays? I've sent Peter to recovery, after hard work. - He means forced labour. - I'm sorry. Nobody asked you for sympathy. It was my own bloody fault, that they caught me. - I'm leaving now, Mr. Lyne. Good bye. - 'Til tomorrow. Good bye. - Who is this cutie? - Not for you. Are you after her? Then she is of course off-limits to all. You embarrass Mr. Tarling again, Peter. The chicks think they are in seventh heaven, if he is around. Peter, do you want to be a waiter at the Cosmos Club? - Oliver, who is this Peter Keene? - One of Lyne's drilled dogs. - Another one? - Yes, but in this case without a whip. - That's almost worse. - Anne, did you perhaps anger Lyne? He wanted to go out with me. I told him that I had an appointment. - Do you? - No. - You do. With me. - See you later. - Katia? - Who are you? To know oneself is the unreachable goal of all wisdom. What's with that rubbish? An old Chinese proverb, I just composed. Get lost, Confucius! For Katia! I think she will need it. You very well know, you son of a bitch! Over the ancestors of my ancestors... - Alas, you mean scoundrel! - Where is she? - At the Cosmos. - Silly cow. - Doesn't she know that... - She does! But she must have the stuff. And from where else should she get it? I know it's not a big position, Peter, but there's something to do. Drive Mr. Keene to the Cosmos Club. Peter, would you do something for me? Naturally. What do you want? Pick up my new watch at Heilbronn, yes? He said it would be finished. I'll get it from you tonight. - Shall I pay promptly? - That's for you. You don't have to give me money, Ray. You've already done so much for me. - You can get anything from me! - You are a darling. Take it anyway. For expenses. What's so funny? Do you still think that my father inherited exclusive right on Christian charity? I think that if your father was looking for a job for a just released prisoner, then not of all places, at the Cosmos Club. Why? It's a respectable club. - And the owner is a friend of me. - Ah, Maybe he knows something about the telegram? Why don't you ask him? - Mr. Putek awaits you in his office. - Thanks. Someone told me you have a key, which can open gambling machines. - How much do you want for it? - More than you can afford, - Good thing you are here! - Why all the commotion? - We have to leave. - Yes, as soon as we have some money. No, at once! This morning someone tried to kill me. What? But Trudy, what are we going to do without money? Putek will spit something out, Charles, darling, talk with Putek. No, I don't want to have anything to do with that. Are you scared of him? Rubbish, I don't want to be involved in this kind of think. - Do you want me to talk to him? - Trudy, don't be so dumb! Don't get involved with Putek. And if you think you know something, forget it! - Max, where is Gloria? - Not again. - I have to talk to her. - Katia, get lost. Max? Whiskey. Yes. I already said there was a mishap. Your people will have to wait! - Alas, my people. I need it for myself! - Then get it somewhere else. - You don't get anything here. - I don't think so. The police will not believe you either after I've been there. You better not try that, Katia. And now get out of here! Gloria, for heaven's sake, just a pinch! Do I have to get Putek first so he can throw you out? - Do you know Max, my bartender? - Yes, I owe him 10 pounds. Peter, I only employ you because of a personal favour for Mr. Lyne. - No monkey business! - No worries, when Ray is vouching for me, you can feel certain. But... you better take this. - What's this? - That's the key to heaven's gate. They have offered me a lot of money for this. Charles! I've asked you to not visit my employees during their working time. I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Putek! It won't happen again. I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Putek. What's wrong with him? Hello? Ling, where are you? I've found the chick with the golden hair. - Have you talked to her? - No. - Well, and what now? - Now I've ordered Chop-suey. - You talk to her. I meet her later. - Hopefully at a safe place. The safest place for a grain of sand is the beach, - says an old Chinese proverb. - Ling, where? As long as the British empire stands, the safest place in the world... Piccadilly Circus, The safest place in the world. Good, thanks, The police doctor confirms that she was addicted to drugs. It's always the same! You seduce the girl so long with heroin until they are ready to deal the stuff. If the supply stalls, the girls become dangerous... Are you convinced now, Whiteside? About the motive yes. But I'm still working on a murder case, Sir. If Mr. Tarling meets a victim again, it would be better, to inform me beforehand. I can only inform you, if I know something myself, I'm sorry, That seems to be the privilege of this Mr. Ling Chu. - Where is the geezer anyway? - No idea, Sir. He was in a restaurant, from where one could precisely see the murder, - Now you are barking up the wrong tree. - Maybe. But it doesn't make a man unbribe-able if he works for you. The secret service of an airline is a convenient cover for drug dealers. - Maybe. But it isn't. - Or for a smart killer. I will talk to Mr. Ling. Send him to me when he shows up. - Anything else? - Yes, Sir. - Someone should deal with this Trudy. - Who? Trudy Mahler. She is a waitress at the Club. And she is scared of something. - And sooner or later she will tell us. - Then she needs police protection, Thanks, Mr. Tarling, I've already arranged that, - I'll be leaving now, Mr. Putek. - We will miss you, Trudy. The police questioned me. I haven't told them anything yet. Not yet! - Do you know anything? - I could tell something about daffodils. I think that should be worth a lot for you. Think about it, but not to long. Tomorrow it could be too late. - What did she want? - Bidding farewell, she is leaving us, - Wasn't she a friend of Katia? - I don't know. Why? Ahh... nothing. - Well, where are you headed? - Who are you? - Police! - I want to go home. Problem with that? I'll accompany you. Where do you live? Victoria Route 114, Alright. Lock the door. I'll stay outside. - But why all this? - Orders, young lady. May I? Please. And now Ladies and Gentleman, Mademoiselle Gloria! I've never hidden myself in the woods. I've discovered as a child the one thing. When a man sees me, he immediately thinks about I' amour... because I'm totally natural. When the men try, like so often, to seduce me with diamonds and mink, I know, that's just because of my body.. Because I'm totally natural. When someone comes, who I really like. I'm humble and small. Then I wish for nothing else in this world, he just has to be a millionaire. I'm a girl, pure like snow... Where is the man from Haute volé? Who is looking for a woman with heart and culture.. Because I'm totally natural. People say, my behaviour isn't very good, but humans, all they do is lying. One look shall be enough, Ladies and Gentleman, I'm totally natural. Who knows, eventually the day comes for me too, that I meet the one I really like. I will tell him: Come, don't be so stubborn... because I'm totally natural. Oliver, what's with you? - Tarling is here. - So what? I've told you that you should throw everything away. Good that the police didn't find this in your coat pocket, - Ray, I need that! - You won't get this in prison. - You've got enough. - Ray, I'm totally done. Nothing can happen to you as as long as you don't lose your head. How? The police is in the house the whole day and Tarling ask questions, - Who did he ask? - All the people here. - Me and Putek and Peter Keene. - Peter Keene? What can he possible get out of him? How one plays at gambling machines... - and never lose? - Don't talk like that about Peter! He is a scoundrel but he loves you. Doesn't that mean anything to you? A lot of people love me, huh? Yes, but only the lord knows why. Who else did Tarling question? He especially has it in for Milburgh and the girl. Anne? Darling, leaver her alone! May I? - Yes, gladly. - Thanks. Peter, hands off! Ah, Ray, you don't have to worry. You know, what I promised you. I even gave Putek the key. - Good evening, Sir. - Good evening. - Anne? - Yes? This morning you could still remember the telegram. Who mailed it? - It wasn't Baker, or? - I don't know. I've been mistaken. - I've never seen it. - Oh, Anne... And who told you to say that? Was it Lyne? Or Milburgh? Why do you care so much about finding a lost telegram? Why does someone care so much about concealing it? The telegram was mailed openly as a business transaction. And you have seen it, Anne. Then something happened in Hong Kong... and the telegram became explosive. The copy disappeared from the folder. - Who was it, Anne? - I don't know. It was handwritten. Whose handwriting was it? Anne, try to remember! I'd hoped for a dance, Mr Tarling. Apparently it has become an interrogation. Milburgh had to go back to the office, a important call from Hong Kong. He asked me to excuse him and to represent him here. Thanks. Thanks for the dance, Mr. Tarling. Do you want to dance? Thanks. - Do you want to dance? - No. - And why do you put up with that? - Ah, leave me alone. May I come in for just a moment? - No, absolutely not. - As you wish. - Good night, Anne. - Good night. - What's going on? - Nothing, Sir. Then don't smirk like that! I'll go on foot. Pick me up tomorrow. Very well, Sir. Good night, Sir. - Who is there? - Police.. There is someone who claims to be your husband, - Charles, is it you? - Well, who else? Come in, darling. I didn't expect him tonight. Rider put a bug in the chiefs ear. What does that mean? - As I said, we have to leave. - Without money? Why are you saying without money? I've talked with Putek. Say, have you gone mad? I said you should forget that! The smart man wears a weapon. - Only the fool pulls the trigger. - Ling! How did you get in here? Ling laughs at locks. My family motto. The hard-boiled leaves deliver bad news to the recipient. - But not this early in the morning. - Shall I tell you the truth? - Yes. - Trudy was caught. What? But she was under police protection. Sadly nobody was there to protect the police. Even I arrived there late. Why did you go there anyway? Too many people were roaming the streets today. - Who? - Putek, Lyne, Milburgh. And who of these three could have done it? That's the question, my friend. Putek worries, Milburgh is scared, Lyne is angry. Facts, Ling, only facts. Good. Trudy became dangerous to Putek. Putek became dangerous to Lyne. And both together, were dangerous to Milburgh. - Can't you be more clear? - Milburgh lead me to Katia. One evening in the club, she became sick. As a favour... Milburgh brought her home. Hm. Pretty poor story, huh? - Nearly poorly enough to be believable. - A likely story. - Do you have more of these? - Yes. Lyne wanted to attack Miss Rider. But he didn't even reach the penalty area. I borrowed my analogy, .. - From football. - How witty. You wanted to talk to me, Sir? Have you read the morning news? Does that mean I should leave? What would you say, if I hand the case over to someone else? If you think someone else will do better. - Ling Chu was here right now. - And he clarified everything? No. But he gave me more information than I ever got from my own people. First Tarling asked us for help. Now he seems to be the one, who helps us the most. I want to hear your plans, Whiteside. You will talk to Sir Archibald right now! I won't make anymore excuses for you! I've talked to him a moment ago. He was really understanding. Why shouldn't he? Whiteside's old fashioned methods weren't exactly successful, And where are you going now? Even a objector to old fashioned methods needs sleep. When you see Whiteside tell him, to keep an eye on Lyne's car. - Why? - The killer drove away with it. Nice car, Mr. Lyne. Where was it this morning? Where it always stands. In front of my flat. And how did it get there, Mr. Lyne? - My driver put it there. - Your driver was dead. Have you ever thought about that he put the car there, before he died? Neighbours are very curious, Mr. Lyne. Charles visited his girlfriend nearly every night and left the car in front of your door. Same as last night. Isn't it very unlikely that he left your room, drove the car to you... and then went back, to be killed? If there is another explanation you are welcome to find it. - Ah, Whiteside! He has his car back. - He didn't miss it at all. The car was in front of his door, this morning. He could have driven it himself, Yes, he could, but who can prove that? Hm. And Milburgh? Chews his nails and moans about the police bothering him, but no hint of a wrong answer. If I don't achieve more with Putek, I'll pack my suitcases. Whiteside, Wait with that for 24 hours. - Is that long enough for a miracle? - Maybe long enough - to refresh Miss Rider's memory. - She didn't come in, this morning. - What does that mean? - I don't know. One moment, please! - Where is Anne? - Miss Rider doesn't work here any longer. - Why not? - Why don't you ask Mr. Lyne. - Where is Mr. Lyne? - Just left. I believe he went home. These workers are so careless. That could have ended badly, huh? What are you doing here? I had to deliver something for the cutie. What did you deliver? She lost her glass slippers at tonight's ball. Ah, and you're her prince, returning them? - Yes, but she isn't here. - Let's look together. Excuse me, Ray. I'm really sorry. It was just bad luck that I clashed together with Mr. Tarling. I don't care about that. But the doll saved her bacon. - What do you want here? - I work here. Do you remember? I'm the honest Peter Keene. Or does the bar stay closed, out of respect for the dead? Ach, shut your mouth! Put that stuff away! - Be still, Gloria. - Give me a drink. - The bar is closed. - C'mon you idiot! Very well, but just one. What are you doing here? I'm trying to figure out, why you got fired. Probably, because my efforts weren't satisfying. During or after working hours? Do you think your question is very tactful? I'm sorry. But I believe, Lyne doesn't like it, when somebody smashes the door into his face. Then that was probably the reason. Maybe. Or have you taken 500 pounds out of the cash box? Pardon? Did someone suggest that? Not to me, but the police know about it. The police? They searched the house. Good work, but... they didn't find this. 500 pounds in your laundry. Did Milburgh put it there? No. How can you be so sure? - Is he your lover? - No! But he was here last night, after Lyne was gone. Then he could have hidden the money easily. No, he was only here, for a few minutes. Do you want to say, that you have stolen the money? - What do you think? - What I think? For example, Peter Keene placed this rotten egg. - Peter Keene? Why should he? - Because Lyne told him to do so. - Lyne could have fired me without that. - Of course, Or do you think all this, is because I didn't let him seduce me? And why not? He wanted to incriminate you. Why incriminate? Whereby incriminate? As a convicted thief your testimony wouldn't have much value in court. Testimony? About what? About the question, who mailed the telegram. Anne! It was Lyne himself, wasn't he? My god, always about that telegram! Do you only have that ridiculous order for tasteless flowers in your head? No! These tasteless flowers were an order for heroin, worth more than 200.000 pounds! What is he doing here? He is after Putek. Give me a double. C'mon! - What can I do for you? - Only death, Mr. Putek, can obliterate the chatter of the fool. A old Chinese proverb that's no longer true nowadays. Listen to the chatter of two fools, who went to their ancestors last night. What can we do without money? Putek will spit some out. - But that doesn't prove what you think! - Mr. Putek. In this country a audio tape maybe doesn't count as proof. But the police always look forward to listening to one. And fear of blackmailing is a good motive for murder. Mr. Putek, please don't run away. After you, Mr. Putek. - What are you doing? - Helping you to leave the city. May I at least ask, why? Lyne probably heard everything from Peter Keene, and from the police. So what? He laid me off. What else can he do to me? Nothing, besides you are to close to him. But he has a criminal-instinct. He knows he has no other way to save his skin! - You mean... - Murder! That's what I mean. Ray Lyne? I don't believe that. Anne, pack your suitcases. By the way, does Lyne know where your mother lives? No. You? - There was a letter from her. - You have awkward habits. The end justifies the means. You stay at your mother's place tonight. Tomorrow I'll find another place for you to stay. - But darling, I have to talk to you. - You are drunk, Gloria. - Of course I am, what do you think? - Go home. - Are you coming to me? - I'll try it. You have to! I can't stand it anymore. The police were here for half the day. - And Putek left with the Chinese guy. - What? Where? How should I know? Stay in the house. And talk with nobody but your mother. And don't pick up the telephone. If someone should ask for you, then your mother doesn't know where you are. I'll come tomorrow whatever happens, Alright? Yes, it's fine. Take care, Anne. That was a very touching farewell. Ray, do you want to leave already? I know you want to get rid of me. You are hot for that little goose in your office. What are you doing there? Just a warning that you will choose your friends better in the future... than Putek. No! No! No! No, no! No! No! Good day, I've received your message. And you didn't hand in your resignation yet? Well let's wait for 24 hours, yes? - Have you found Miss Rider? - Yes. She is in good hands, - Do you really think that is the best way? - Sadly yes. - Oliver, is that true? - What? What Jack Tarling says. That Lyne... Please try my number once again? - That he deals with drugs. - I... I don't know. - Still no answer. - Let it ring longer. Let's assume, he doesn't believe me. He will! He knows that women fall for him. - Hello? - Ray? This is Anne. I've tried all evening to to reach you, Ray. But I couldn't get rid of Tarling. You are a reasonable girl, Anne. We'll meet at 10 o'clock at the phantasie-bar. I have to take care of some things before. See you later. What would you do if you were in my shoes? Arrest Lyne. Because he laid-off a secretary, who is not interested in him? After all, he was trying to incriminate her, Try to make that plain to the court. I'm a police officer, Tarling. I can't access a theory that easily. You claim that Lyne is a killer, who deals with drugs hidden in daffodils. Yes. But your evidence has been destroyed. If I try to arrest a man like Lyne, without evidence, then I won't have to resign myself. Then I'll soon be patrolling again. You rather wait for a new corpse? I... I will talk. - I'll tell everything. - Not everything. Just the truth. Yes, yes. You have a very plausible theory, but it fits just as good to Milburgh... and to Putek, But only Lyne could order Keen to incriminate Miss Rider. That doesn't have to be in connection with the murders. At least have Lyne watched. Will do, as soon as I'm back at the office. We still pull together, Tarling. In the meantime find out, what Ling Chu does behind closed doors. Thank you for the drink. Are you going to travel, Mr. Putek? Have you already said good bye to Mr. Lyne? No bad injuries, only your head worries me. - Yes, me too. - Do you know who it was? I lit a match and suddenly I saw a knife coming at me. - Excuse me, are you Mr. Lyne? - Yes. A letter for you, Sir. Just delivered by a messenger. Thank you, Sir. Let's see if that is the size of your head. Ling, why did you shut yourself in? Who was with you over there? - Someone, who calls himself Putek. - Putek? In Germany he is wanted for murder. Lyne found that out. That means Putek has to do what Lyne says and has to shut his mouth. And he told you all that himself? In a little chat, hm? I've asked him about it. Ach, you just have asked him, and he told you that he is a killer. My persuasion is boundless. I understand. Say, is it true that according to the English law... a wife can't be forced to testify against her husband? - Yes, why? - That would explain why... - Lyne married in secret. - Lyne? Married? Who? Gloria. - What's this? - Opium and mandragora. Calm down, the doctor prescribed it. Ling, what else did Putek tell you thanks to your persuasion? That he visited Trudy last night, to warn her that she... - is blackmailing the wrong guy. - What? Trudy blackmailed Putek? - She did. - Did you know this before? - I did. - Why didn't you tell me? - The inscrutableness of the Far Fast. - Oh, Ling, don't start it again! Jack, listen, I have to be one step ahead of the police. - Yes, fine, for all I care. But why? - Because a lunatic can't be held... responsible for his actions And I have... other plans for the daffodil-killer. What have you got to do with it anyway? - The main thing is he will be disarmed. - The Chinese girl, who was killed... She was not like the others. - Did she work for you? - She contributed. She was my daughter. Sleep well, my friend. You'll read more things in the morning news, - Where are you going, Ling? - I'll find Raymond Lyne and kill him. Ling. Ling, come back. Ling Chu! It was him! Come here, boy! I know what Lyne meant to you. But if you can't behave I have to lead you away, understood? Come, Peter, come. Let's go. Peter! Peter! - Ling Chu found him? - No, we were watching him. And we lost him at 00.30 o'clock. Lyne was killed before midnight. I'm still looking for the daffodil-killer. But that's impossible. You've had a nice theory, but she wasn't hole-proof. - Where is Anne Rider? - Why? - I want to interrogate her. - For what reason? Because Lyne wasn't killed at the cemetery. - But where? - At Miss Riders home. Give me the file for a sec? Thanks, We have found this in Lyne's pocket. If Miss Rider didn't kill him, she certainly did lure him with her invitation into death. "Ray, my darling. Tarling just showed up," and I can't get rid of him without making him curious. But I'll try to shake him off fast. Meanwhile I send you the key to my flat. Wait for me. I'll come as soon as I'm free. "I have to talk to you. Your Anne." - This has to be fake. - We'll get it checked by graphologists. But the fact is that Lyne had her key with him. - Hello? - Tarling speaking, a friend of Anne. - Can I talk to her? - Anne is not here. I know you've been told to say, she's not there. Tell her, Jack Tarling wants to talk with her. I don't know what you mean. Mrs. Rider? Hello? - Just a moment! Where are you going? - I'll tell you that when I'm back. - Shall I go after him, Sir? - No, he'll come back. - Osborne? - Yes sir? Have you found the messenger, who delivered the letter? Yes, Sir. His order was to meet a young lady a the Piccadilly subway station and to bring a letter for Lyne to the phantasie-bar. Did he recognize Miss Rider on the pictures? Yes, Sir. And we found this here in the hall. I'll let the number be determined. West to headquarters, Sir, you are expected in Lyne's office. - Where is she? - I don't know. Where is she? - Does everything look like this? - The whole flat, Sir, I've ordered our people here. They'll have quite something to do. Who is there? We found him unconscious here. The doctor has just taken care of him. - What are you doing here? - Good morning, inspector. - I wanted to visit Raymond Lyne. - How did you get in? I don't know. They always ask me the same question... Through the door. But someone was here before me. - At what time was that? - About I am in the morning. Raymond Lyne was killed at midnight by the daffodil-killer. I see. Then Putek told me a lie. It wasn't Putek. We arrested him at 22 o'clock at the airport. - Milburgh. - Have you seen this before? Yes. Yes, in a women's hand-bag. Actually I was looking for something different, but I didn't find that. I'm afraid, inspector, my actions were completely against the law. I'll note it on your long accusation list. - Thanks a lot. - Whose hand-bag was it? Anne Riders? No, it belonged to Lyne's wife. Gloria. Inspector! May I come with you? If you want to. - Dead? - No. Your ancestors can call off the welcoming party. She would come quite along at the Hong Kong police, inspector. Inspector - Yes? Maybe Milburgh was looking for this. What's this? Evidence of fraud, which Milburgh committed at Lyne & Co... before the death of the senior chief. Apparently Raymond Lyne was smarter than the old man and found it, but preferred not to file a complaint. That's why Milburgh had to keep quiet, about what Lyne wanted him to do. - Murder included. - I don't think so. Why did you kill her? - My own mother? - Your mother? Yes. I'm Anne's half-brother. We grew up together in this house. My mother was sick. Heart disease. We both knew, If something happened to me, the shock would kill her. And now she is dead. What should have happened to you after you eliminated Lyne? Don't move! Should Anne send him your key because of this? No, I had to find something. I thought it would be in Lyne's house. Anne should distract Lyne. - And to be sure you killed him! - For that, I sadly wasn't brave enough. What did you look for in Lyne's home? Freeze. More! What was it? Fine. Lyne's father discovered that his son was a crook. It nearly broke his heart. He sent him away, And he begged me to cover him. I was stupid enough to say yes. I faked the books, I mislead the accountants. Then the old man died. And Raymond Lyne, inherited the company, with the evidence of my frauds. - Did Anne know about it? - Of course, I hired her at the office, when her predecessor became to nosy, - Did you know about Lyne's drug dealing? - No. - But you! - I couldn't prove anything. That's why I had to keep my mouth shut. Not only, did you have to keep your mouth shut! - You had to kill, when Lyne ordered it! - No. Who was it then? I don't know. I thought it was Lyne himself. But now.. Who knew that your mother lives here? And who had a reason to kill her? It surely was someone looking for Anne. - Did your mother knew where Anne was? - No. And where is she now? At the Queens Hotel. As Anne Stevens. Leave me. After him, go! I'll call Anne. First call Whiteside, he will pick her up immediately. Hello? - Hello? - What number do you wish to call? That's enough. She has to be hospitalized. You can try it again tonight, What did you find out, inspector? Nothing we wouldn't have found out ourselves. She was crazy of jealousy and went there to kill Anne. She was there when Lyne was killed. Everyone kills... Everyone kill, what he loves the most, but not everyone dies. - What does she mean? - Don't you see, inspector? It's Peter Keene. The man who was obsessed with Lyne and hated everyone else, when someone was standing in Lyne's way. He just had to wave, and Peter eliminated the danger. And still he killed the man he admired? Yes, a mistake. - A mistake? - That's the only explanation. He went there to kill Anne, right? But he didn't know, that she sent Lyne her key. The door opened, he threw the knife. Without hesitation. The ambulance is on it's way. What happened? Scotland Yard. Inspector... Whiteside. Hello? Speaking. I asked once more at the Brunswick Hotel. Mr. Tarling isn't back yet. Yes, good, thanks. One more thing, ls there really no message for me from Mr. Mil... from someone else? - Certainly not. No message at all. - Thanks. - Where is Peter Keene? - I don't know. You were with him this morning Where is he? - No idea. - What did he say? - He moaned about Mr. Lyne. - What did he say? - That Miss Rider killed Lyne. - Will he now find Miss Rider? - I don't know! - Tell me exactly what he told you! - Police. - Yes? I'm Inspector Whiteside from Scotland Yard. Call Miss Stevens. Oh, she will thrilled. She has been waiting all day for you. - I'll wait outside with the other guys. - Miss Stevens, the police are here. Peter, what are you doing here? - Tarling! - Did he get her? 2 minutes ago! A light blue standard-vanguard, Nr. NUD 264. I repeat: 264. Alert phase 1! Clear all radio communication. I repeat: Clear all radio communication. We can't be more than a quarter mile behind him. He's turned into Swain's Lane. - Where does he want to go? - To the Highgate-cemetery. - One more. - Yes, of course. That cost Peter his life. And Ray was the donor. A limitless, free supply that eventually drove him mad. When he killed Ray Lyne, he condemned himself to death, - Did you have to kill him? - It was self-defence.
