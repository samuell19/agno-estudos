Still in bed? It's 7 a.m., Max. Can we take a dog? Have you seen your room? Do you want to add a dog to this whole bazaar? But one day can we? I just answered you. You can't even take care of your room, so of a living being, let's not talk about it. The report has been on Neretin's desk since yesterday. The meeting is at 10 a.m. Have a good day ! Do your dishes. I arrive. As you know, my nanobots are able to grow and change shape on demand. Whether to block a virus that is constantly evolving ... create an organic firewall to counter hackers ... or provide protection databases that contain top-secret information ... Nothing and no one is more reliable and efficient than my nanobots. When will the field tests start ? I will be ready in a few days. The data will follow soon after. Consider that your funding has been extended. Don't cry victory too quickly. We are not sure that robots adapt to real conditions as quickly as in theory. Sorry, can I come in? Between. I hope you have a good excuse. Watch where you walk, loser. Enough, both of you. Focus on your textbooks. Complex nanotechnology. Who transforms endlessly, the ultimate hacker. It exists ! And should that interest me? It can infiltrate security systems. It's a kind of technology ... alive, like mercury. It can hack into banks, stock market prices ... This is serious. Go get Gecko. The lake is asleep, just like the forest and the reeds. As the willow creaked ... As the willow creaked ... Where's the willow? Sleep! Sleep! I had wonderful dreams, covered in white. On their silver case rested sparkling stones. On a carpet made of grass and flowers ... I was sleeping, my breathing lifting my chest ... You lost the ball, you moron? Are you drawing my girlfriend? What is that ? I will teach you life. Gift ! ... pure and sparkling white. The silent and tender stars fell from the heavens ... What is going on ? Skoryk! Do you want to set the school on fire? At the director's! Come on, my little ones. In bed. I hate new technologies. They will take me straight to a museum. No museum will want you. You talk too much. Sweet dreams fragmented. I could easily break into the laboratory, but ... this safe ... It's a state-of-the-art, fireproof chest with 5 cm steel walls and advanced protection system. At this level, I do not guarantee anything. Non... No, forget your guarantees. Refresh my memory, why are you working for me Because I am the best. Non. The real reason, clever boy. That is what I thought. So bring me those nanobots. He drew all night again ... And the dishes, as usual. Sorry, darling, but you won't have a dog. USER PASSWORD The system is ready. Alert... Stop ! More a gesture. Bizarre... I do not know this brand. It was you who did it ? Yes... Cool. Your tag is really ... excellent. Thank you. Did you hear that? You're cool ! An idea came to my mind. And if we separated ... of our business partners? All the serious guys have switched to cryptocurrency. It's a virtual currency, on the computer. You just have to find a way to extract it. A mission for nanobots. I am a genius ! Chose promise... It's empty. What do you mean ? What is that thing ? Where are the robots? Everyone will know the name of Myron. Everyone will respect me. And will be afraid of me. With these nanobots, I will finally have the power! Read and sign, please. So, did we do something stupid? There is one that will end at the museum! The farm, tin can. What happened ? I did not see anything. Skyba. Yes. A burglar broke into the lab. Security agents chased him, but he escaped. The police are viewing the video surveillance images. I'm sure it will help us find our robots. Or at least the one who stole them. Non. These are my nanobots. My creations. I know how they think and operate. I will find them on my own. What happened here? How awkward you are! Is that your kit? I said that new technologies were a source of trouble. They wouldn't steal me that easily. I should hire him as a security consultant ... What is that ? A pulse neutralizer. It against electromagnetic waves, it can deactivate any device and separate nanobots. Put them in immobility mode, or turn them off. Encoding completed. COMPLETED Given my budget, I think my only option is theft. Theft: taking possession of the property of others Society: punished by law Buddhism: bad karma Christianity: buttocks thrown into the flames of hell Hey, kid! Are you stealing from me or what? Thief ! Alert: nanoactivity identified. Well... It's weird ... They could have repainted over it. To do what ? It's a work of art! Health. Your brain produces an excess of cortisol and adrenaline, which increases your heart rate. How can you be here? You have to calm down. Start by breathing. Do like me. He seems to confuse breathing and song. Maybe I should have started with word-of-mouth? Can I help you ? I would need to see the pictures from this last hour. Are you from the police? Non. So I ask you to leave. Thank you. Extraction of surveillance data . DOWNLOAD I have hallucinations ... To answer your question about my presence here, it's simple: you created me by getting me out of the bomb in the form of graffiti. But it was just paint. Faux. I am made of microscopic nanobots. You wanted paint, so I changed. You wanted to paint a robot dog, so I became a robot dog. I am programmed to serve my creator. Your creator? You created me, Max. You said I was cool. Wait ... So this fight at school ... It is you who fought you with my bag? Your hypothalamus has sent a signal to your nervous system which I interpreted as a desire to beat you. And I helped you a little ... Wait, and at the store ... At the store I kept you from committing a crime to avoid bad karma and your buttocks are thrown into the flames of hell. Besides, what is buttocks? This is what you used instead of your head! Not only do I no longer have any pens, but I'm going to be in trouble with this brute Dan. - Hide. - To hide... It's to make sure that you can't see me anymore. I can do that. "Invisible" mode activated. Hi Dad. Sorry, I have an urgent call to make. Which of us is more invisible? The "invisible" mode works. Where are you ? You are the ? Bizarre... I really hallucinated. Drawing contest. The big price : one year of training in Levram studios. It is the last day to submit your application. I have no chance of winning ... So what's the point of trying? Hey, kid! Are you stealing from me or what? What are you making, my little robots? Your coffee. - Thank you. - Good tasting. Alert! Nanoactivity spotted nearby. Here you are... SUBMIT Health. Cool, this place. Say ... I'm looking for the tagger who signs like this. Does not ring a bell. Non. We play ? Max ! You created a dog. So let's do human-dog activities! According to my analysis, the park seems to be full of popular activities. Max... But ... you disappeared yesterday. Mon mode "invisible" ? You told me to hide. - Do you want us to go to the park? - Yes. - Like that? - Like that what? Did you look at yourself? I thought you made me look cool. Yes, it's true. You're cool. - It's just that ... - My tail? What's wrong with my tail? Nothing, let me finish. It's just that you don't look ... like a real dog. I think I understood. You want me to look a real fox terrier, right ? - Exactly. - No problem. It is true ? Can you do it? Yes. Can we play now? Yes, we can play. But we would need a leash. No problem, Max. Behave like a real dog. You promised me. Anything you want, Max. My information was correct, activities at the park are fun! Are you crazy or what ? Don't speak in public! Someone is going to have a heart attack. You think ? I have an idea. Max, put this on. Max, here Foxter, finished. So ? - Very good ! - I'm not telling you. Max, what are they making? What strange and irrational behavior ! Don't worry, it's nothing. This is how dogs greet each other. Come on, get to know each other. Okay. So... Let's see, how to do ... Okay. Sorry to bother you ... Well. Itâ€™s really weird. Max, this is wrong. Nobody wants to play with me. Like me at school ... Did you feel their backside? Yes. Your smell ! You don't smell like a dog. You are smart! For a human. I reproduce the olfactory molecules ... It worked, Max! Hello sir... Nice to meet you. It's really cool, Max! It's great to be a dog. You should try. You have to clean up behind me. I won't touch your droppings. But that is part of the role of dog owners! I don't have a bag. Use your hand. They are not even real. Come on, Max. - Go on ... - It's okay. Come on, Max, pick them up. Come on ! And here is an extraordinary discovery: the very first flying poop! Make sure it's mine ... I've got you ! It looks like mine. Max ? What is that ? Nothing special. Oh, how cute! It's your dog ? Yes that's it. My real dog. From tail to truffle. It's nice... What is his name ? Foxter. His name is Foxter. Sonia ! We're going to the Art Platform. See you later. Hi, Foxter. Health. So say Max, I perceive a large secretion of dopamine! And your serotonin level is exploding. Shut up. Looks like you like it. I have no chance with it. Maybe you should sniff her behind? It could work. I have the impression that relationship problems between humans are due to their lack of tail. Why are you so sure you don't have a chance? Because she already has a boyfriend, Dan. What is a "boyfriend Dan"? A bully who spoils my life. She told you she was going to the Art Platform. According to my information, it's a place where young humans go to spend their parents' money. So what ? So what... I may have an idea. An idea ? I do not believe it. Nanobots have turned into dog. They are programmed to take the form of the desire of their master. If this boy wanted a dog, that would explain everything. The most amazing thing is that the dog seems to lead, not the boy. It means that the artificial intelligence module is working. No I do not know him. Hello? What are you doing ? I'm investigating. Do you think you are Sherlock Holmes? - Look, I'm trying to ... - Are you trying ? If I don't get the nanobots today, I mug you in a small package ... and I send you to Timbuktu. It is very far. Pigeon? What are we doing here? You will see. Trust me. Weird, why do I want to catch these bubbles? Max, look, she's in the crowd. Is this boy sick? The one who makes weird movements? He dances. I see ... Wouldn't it be Dan the bully? This funny behavior begins to please me. - Let's move on. - Hold on. Congratulations to the winner of this battle! Applaud! I analyzed what captivated the girls. I know how to get his attention. We need a quiet place. Otherwise, your haircut is called "bowl cut". The rest, you shouldn't know. Children's problems are complex. Here. Here is good. What is your plan? No no... Why not. Here. Cool. Yep! And the final touch ... That's it. According to fashion blogs, you officially look cool. Are we going to funny movements? What is he drawing? It's you ? Health. Health. Health. Ah yes... Do you know the DJ? It's cool. So like that, do you know everyone? So what ? Does this signature speak to you? Here, would the loser be in trouble? Where is he ? Pass your phone. I would love to see its execution. Here is his name and address. Tell him you're coming from Dan. It works. That's it. It's over for this loser. It's cool. Okay, come on ... Okay, well ... By the way... It's you... who drew that? Yes it's me. - That's wonderful. - Wow ! Health. So that's the famous "hugs"! They are proof of affection. It's much better than sniffing the hindquarters. Did you just make a joke? I don't know, was she good? The nanorobot-dog learns to take care of others. My mom doesn't want me to have a dog, then go... Switch to "invisible" mode. And now ? I think we should tell her the news. Do it yourself. It's for your work that we have to move. Max has no friends here anyway. A new school ... Calm down. Obviously, it's easy for you! "No friends" ? You didn't even ask me for my opinion. What am I, too much baggage? A stain on pants? Don't be cheeky. You don't care about me. Both. - Hold on. - Go! I will be better off without you. Max. Max ! Non ! Pavlo ! Call an ambulance ! You're welcome ! He could have saved him. Why didn't he do it? Patron. What do you want ? Come when I call you. What is that ? A handful of nanobots. To make it short, nanobots took the form of a kind of super dog. And then it vanished. And that's all there was left. It stinks. What do we do with it? Let's ask our scientists to analyze them. Yes... I have an idea. Have them analyzed. We will reproduce them en masse. Tons at a time. Excellent plan. Yes. It's a great plan. Napoleon! Its analysis results are correct. He can come back in two days. What do you mean, "evaporated"? Since when haven't you slept? Whatever. Nanobots have learned to control their environment. Impressive, but Gearz Robotics management is concerned. Are you covering me? As long as I could. How is dad He had surgery. Doctors say he will get out. Excess adrenaline and bile is indicative of great emotional stress. - Why didn't you help him? - Not helped? I have seen everything. You were running fast, you could have pushed him off the road. But you wanted to run away! I only helped you, Max. Help me ? My father is in the hospital. I thought you were my friend and you ... Do you know what you are? Max... Well... I do not understand. What do you mean you can't reproduce them? It is almost impossible to reverse nanotechnology. And it's almost impossible to survive my fist, but you can try. - How long will it take? - A year or more. Un an? - Where is the boy ? - Which ? You told me about a kid. Go and get it. He is just a child. You work for me. You do not have a choice. Your father owes me a debt. You owe me. The kid doesn't know anything. He made a dog out of nanobots. Go and get it. You understood ? Executed. Come on! Follow him. Madame Skoryk? Hi, son. Approach. You look even worse than me! It's my fault. Max... I'm just a mistake of nature, a failed designer. If you want to move, then let's move. I do not care. I will draw other friends. You were right, we should have consulted you. We won't leave if you don't want to. Everybody makes mistakes. Honey... Max ! You know, Foxter, everyone makes mistakes. It is true. I'll try to explain it to you. I know you were trying to help me run away. Okay. I was running away because I thought Daddy wanted to get on my skin. Is that so ? What did he want to do with your skin? Nothing, it's just an expression. Okay. I ran away, but I didn't want to. Ah! I don't understand, explain to me. Sometimes humans do things they don't want to do. But why ? Well, imagine you like a girl and pretend to ignore it. Why ? To get his attention. Humans are strange creatures without logic. But hey, I was created to obey you. Non. You should make your own decisions. When a car hits a human, we don't care what i want. Should I have saved the human? Obviously! Human life is much more important than my little moods. I see. We don't care, I have to make decisions, life is more important than states of mind. - That's it ? - Pretty much. You're cool. - You too. - High five ! Max, look! Sonia? What are you doing here ? I learned for your father, I decided to come. Honestly... I'm very happy to see you. You came... sans dan? Well... He invented that I was his girlfriend, but I think it's a moron. You are not allowed to park here. So move it ... Little smart. Can you imagine yourself in this car? You imagine us, both on an endless highway ... extending to the horizon? - Max ... - That would be great. Tell him you can drive. - Leave me ! - What? Sit behind the wheel, I'll drive. She will be impressed! You know, I can drive. It is true ? You're crazy ? After all, he asked me to move his car! Try to look natural. How are you going to start it? Put your hands on the wheel, tell him you have magic fingers and presses the button. Well ... I have magic fingers. Let's go. And now ? This toy will show us what it is capable of. Who are you? This beauty has dog! Take this ! It was Dan! You saw ? When did you learn to drive? And like that ? This is madness. It's ... not that difficult! I didn't think you were that cool. Dating site tip: give him a compliment. Thank you. You too are cool. Really cool, my hen! Great advice ... thank you! You start to tire me ... VOICE COMMAND 4x4 black: 0808-AI. Owner of the vehicle sought by Interpol. There are people behind. We should let them pass. You have nothing ? What took you? We almost died. I told you not to take my orders literally! How can you be so stupid? Sonia. It's not what you think. Didn't you yell at your imaginary friend? No ! I yelled at my dog. Finally, it is not really a dog. He's a top-secret super robot. OUT OF SERVICE SYSTEM RESTART You have nothing ? No, I'm fine. I'm from the police. I would like to see your license, but I suspect you don't have one. This car is not yours, is it? My friend asked me to move it for him. I know you have something else that doesn't belong to you. I'm not sure I understand. You know what ? You will follow me to the station and everything will become clearer. We prefer to walk, thank you. Do I have to drag you there by force? Isn't that a police car? Keep you busy Emergency mode ... Mode... Do not worry. I am a friend. I didn't mean to cause you an accident. I was trying to slow down those chasing you. Who are you ? Let's say it was I who gave birth to you. You can trust me. He got Max and Sonia on board. I couldn't help them. My nanoconnections are very weak. You have to help me find the kids. Sorry, my program tracks nanobots. He is unable to find people. Max wears an earpiece. I made it from nanobots. Where is the dog ? Let Sonia go. No no no... What would you do with such a flea bag? It doesn't concern you. He stayed in the hospital. I personally intend to snatch him ... The paws, tail and ears. I will reduce it ... in pieces ! You will no longer recognize him. Then I will use nanobots to conquer the world. Like Napoleon. If the dog is not in the hospital as you said... It is of interest to you that I find it. What are you hiding from me there? Give me that. Right now. Soon the city will be mine. I am on the verge of realizing my childhood dream. If the owner of this building kidnapped them, so our chances are pretty slim. Is your "invisible" mode still working? Yes, it works. But it has bugs because nanochannels are interrupted. It's incredible. I don't get over it. The kids are inside, we should call the police. We cannot intervene alone. I'm going to record everything you see. I will send the pictures to the police. You are a very intelligent human specimen . Thank you. I lied. Foxter is in the car, not in the hospital. Foxter, is that the robot they talked about? He can make himself invisible. So it was about him that you were yelling. How is it possible ? What is it exactly ? Some kind of nanorobot, I think. It can turn into lots of different things. It's fantastic. Can he drive a car? Yes. He can drive. Not me. I'm not cool. I am a loser. It's not true. Nobody would have stood up to this man like you did. You really have to be very brave. Thank you. So the big guy, How are we going to get out of here? Hi guys. Have you seen Arcan? He went out. He's here, grab him! INVISIBLE MODE SYSTEM ERROR He's there ! - What's the matter ? - It's that thing! Get up ! Is! Help me ! You are useless ! Catch it! It's over. Now let's have fun. Why robots don't change shape without kid's order? They use their owner's code . If you want them to obey, you will need a good hacker and it will take time to reformulate all the encoding. I see. I have a hacker. You will do it. Non. Non ? I do not know this word. I can reformulate it for you: I will never do such a thing in my life . I created these robots for a good cause, not for you. Good... So in three seconds, the lady will discover the joys of aerobatics. A ! Of them ! - Three! - Stop it! Yes ! We can't leave them Foxter. You can't imagine what they want to do. I have a plan, but I need help. What is that ? No idea, but he neutralized the car electronics. It could be useful. Good game. How should I encode robots? What should they do? I want them to turn into an unstoppable virus, barrier-proof, they steal cryptocurrency and let them obey my orders. Once I have all the money I want, I can go everywhere. I will be master of this city. I will control all the computers. Everyone will obey me and be afraid of me. Nanobots will be my secret weapon. At this moment, no one will dare to disrespect me. I get it. The bell must first be removed. Glass blocks the signal. Okay, but don't try anything. Or I'm reducing you to molecules. Remove the bell. I turn off the system ... Something has to be done. We are not programmed to oppose humans. ACCESS DENIED Why is it so long? Reprogram me this pooch! Max... Approach. Do you remember when you said that I had to make my own decisions? I don't want to become a weapon in the service of this psychopath. I made a decision, but i need your help. Max, you have to order me to disintegrate. To disintegrate? I can not do that. Afterwards, you will no longer be my Foxter. I will always be with you. It was you who created me. Be strong. We will always be together. I promise you. I will have you all! I am sorry... Disintegrate. Go get the car. The cops know you kidnapped the kids. And... I sent a video to the media showing the junk that you are. You're screwed. Find a landline phone. Call my helicopter! Max, remember: I am you and you are me ... You're stupid ? You are nothing without your little dog! Let go! I would play well with you, but I have to go. Come on! Come over there! Come on! It's time to get out! Throw me the ladder! Max ! Let go! You want ? No problem ! You go-y, Max. You are the hero of your universe. Remember : I will always be with you. WIND - WEIGHT SIZE - DISTANCE CHUTE I will break you. We will see. Sonia ! Can you teach him to fly? Attention ! My hero... Let's go home, my little ones. I'm sorry for your dog. He was cool. He was a true friend. Yes, it is true. Mum ! Max ! Max! You are alive ! How are you ? You made us one of those fears! Come on, we're going home. Health. Health. You know, Gearz Robotics has a bright future. I really need a professional to strengthen our security system. Are you interested ? - Max, can you go open? - Hush ... I have a letter for Max Skoryk. Here. It's the contest. I won a drawing contest! And a year of training with a real artist! That's great. I didn't know you participated. Neither do I. Bravo ! Take it, it is for you. Just for you. Hi, little father! What are you doing here ? What are you going to call it? Me ? If you could arrest the city's worst criminal, is that you are responsible enough to have a dog. So what is it going to be called? Foxter. His name is Foxter. Go for Foxter. It's okay with me. Come on, Foxter, we will make you a real dog! Adaptation : Kim Bento-Parry Subtitling: VDM
