Where might she be? Aren't we going to a movie? Now you’re going to have the movie. What’s up, Venya? Mark Oan. Does the name Mark Oan tell you anything? Yes. He’s the head of Christian Dior Fashion House. Why? He's sent an invitation to Paris. The French had to send one for the Paris Fashion Week. He sent a personal invitation to Paris. Addressed to you. And what’s the use of it? They won’t let me out anyway. Why you told me this? To spoil my mood? What are you doing? - There was a meeting. - I don’t even want to hear it. You’ve been approved. Panova, you are flying to Paris. - Venya, is that a joke? - No. No. Yekaterina Mikhailovna, our state gives you an enormous credit of trust by sending you abroad. Do you understand? I do. Perfect. Do you realize your guilt to the Motherland? - Where is my guilt? - Don’t you see where it is? You knew about your husband’s moods. And you didn’t tell his management about it. I did not know. You probably didn’t and we believe you, but what does that mean? What? It means, Yekaterina Mikhailovna, that you weren’t vigilant, while you had to be. A Soviet person should always be on the alert, especially while abroad, surrounded by enemies. For example, you will be asked at the press conference whether any obstacles had been put to you after your husband’s betrayal. What will you say? There were no obstacles. The answer is correct. And what will you say if they ask you why you didn’t go with your husband? Well... What will you tell them? That I love my motherland and I don’t need any other. Good answer, Yekaterina Mikhailovna. But hmm... Display more vividness, more optimism. - Any other questions? - Oh yes. I’ve got a list on the international situation and the communist parties of Capitalist countries. So, let's start. Hello, hello, Rem. Can you hear me? Hello... Hello, Katya. Hi, darling. - Katya, I missed you so much. - I miss you very much too. SPEAKS FRENCH And I’m dreaming of you. Reme! It’s a victory. I don’t know how you managed to organize this invitation from Dior House, but they couldn’t help letting me go to Paris after that. I told you I’d do everything for us to be together. And I love you very much too. Kisses, darling. I love you, darling. Goodbye. Thank you for coming and helping with the formalities, so that Vera Ivanovna didn't have to go downstairs. This is a great honor for me to help such an honored person as Vera Ivanovna. Will you keep the documents in your office? Yes. I hope it won’t be lost. And all that will remain between us. Don’t worry. That’s our job. Nothing shall be lost. Oh, let me see you out. My honor. - There? - Yes. Have a nice day. The gate is totally broken. Who was that? A doctor? Yes. A great specialist. A really great one. I’ll finish the watermelon and go. So what? You’re a fool, but a lucky one. Now, calm down. Don’t jump like that. Especially on the stage. - On the runway. - Exactly. Thank you very much. Take care. And I was informed who helped Yekaterina to go to the Paris Fashion Week. Yes, it was me. I confess. What do you need that for, Toma? Listen, she is a nice girl, and she does her job well. And she can adequately represent our Soviet fashion at the foreign show. In case you don’t know, a personal invitation was sent to Panova. And if you don’t let her go to Paris, you will create additional idle talk. And was it the only reason you helped her? No. I haven’t forgotten how she helped me to return you to the family. Toma, I’ve got a meeting in five minutes. All right. We’ll talk at home. - See you in the evening. - Bye. Have you ironed a shirt for me? It is Marianna who should do the ironing for you. - There you go. - I do. You stay at Nechaeva’s house day and night. I told you. I’ve got a business there. I see your business. Don’t shout. Quiet. I visit her aunt, Vera Ivanovna. What do you need from this mad old woman? We need. You, Sasha and me. We need her house, and it will be ours. Very funny. You are crazy! Idiot! Valera. - Valera! - What? Tell me everything. Iron me a shirt first. Shall we have some tea? I’m afraid to go. I’m afraid to think that we may never see each other again. Yes, I understand. It’s scary. In fact, it is always scary and responsible to make a choice. Yes. Well, come on. Don’t dramatize. You won’t be alone there. You’ll have someone you love nearby. It’ll come out right, Katya. And the main thing you should remember is that your daddy will always be here waiting for you. Thank you... daddy. Katya, my dear Katya. Well, let’s have some tea with raspberry jam. I’ve made it myself, all myself. Go ahead. Valera, you’re eating too much. Give this to Vera Ivanovna. And remember me to her. If she asks you to make her some porridge again, do it the way I taught you, with milk and... ...and a pinch of salt, Galya, I remember. And a pinch of salt. Right. That’s a good wife. Well, I have to go or I’ll be late. See you in the evening. Hello, Vitya. Have you taken the edge off? Vera Ivanovna, take these 20 drops one hour before meals, and these 15 drops one hour after meals. I’ll get it all wrong, remind me next time. I’m afraid we won’t see each other in the near future. I’ve found a very good nurse. She’ll come to you to make injections. Here’s her phone number. Give it to Valera, he’ll remember, and I’ll forget it anyway. Aren’t you going to stay in Paris, by the way? I’ve got no one there. And thanks for the patties, Katya. The patties are mine. Galya has made them. Really? Well, thank you. And give my thanks to Galya. Here you are, it’s a gift from me. Give it to her. Thank you. Wouldn't such present be too fat a lot for Galya? Don’t envy her. - Goodbye, Vera Ivanovna. - My dear Katya. Take care of her. You’d better bring back some chestnuts. Shall we have some patties? I’ll go and make some tea first... Food goes better with tea. What do you think? It’s very beautiful. Indescribable beauty. Thank you. Katya, and what are the gifts about? Just for fun. I wanted to make something pleasant for you. You’re pampering us, daughter. I’m going on a long business trip. So we won’t see each other for a long time. Take care of yourself. I wish your mum could see what you are like. I’ll miss you very much. Well. Bye. She’s gone mad. She ate lemons the day before yesterday, and onions yesterday. Can you imagine? She’s put on some weight, but it’s no problem. She’ll have a baby and I’ll take her in hand afterwards. And then I’ll be a father. It will be a girl, I am sure. She thinks it will be a boy. But I am sure it’s a girl. That’s it. Girls, here we are. Get off. Get off in a group, comrades. Get off, move. Why are we sitting? We have very little time left. Venya, I want to tell you something. We are flying to Paris now, I’ll stay there and never return. - I do not understand. - I’ll stay to live in Paris. Are you mad? That’s a disaster. Katya, you have worked so much to return your name. People got to love you again. You are a star. And now you are going to ruin it all. They will destroy you. They will never forgive you. Venya, it’s of no importance to me. I was given a second chance. I will have a baby, Reme’s baby. He’s waiting for me there. I am sorry, you must have confused something. You are mistaken. Venya! There must be some misunderstanding. I need to take the plane. It’s a mistake. Venya! - What's going on? - It’s a mistake. What's going on? Where is she taken? In you go, to the plane! - Katya! - Venya! Now our enemies in the west think that all Soviet women are whores. You’ve disgraced yourself all over the world, but you’ve also put to shame all Soviet women. Well, Katya, your Frenchman has lied to you, right? Go to hell. What a translation... What a shame all over the country. Panova has long been looking for trouble. Hush, hush, Lena. They seem to be happy that the whole world will see her breasts! Do you think the Frenchman paid her for that? Nobody has ever seen a naked Soviet woman. What has she done to herself. And what has she done to us. Bonjour Hello. Excuse me, can I see Katya Panova? Katya... Panova. Wait. Wait a minute. What's going on here? Have you got what you wanted? What do you mean, monsieur? You perfectly know what I mean. Comrade monsieur. Where is Katya Panova? There is no Katya Panova any more. Is there anybody here? Does anybody hear me?! Untie me! Untie me! Is there anybody here? Untie me! Untie me! Untie! Let me go! Let me go! Is it all your doing? Yes, our department is not sitting idle. We have timely prevented a possible scandal in Paris. And someone showed political short-sightedness and incompetence in staff recruitment, and contributed to a possibility for Yekaterina Panova to defect abroad. You are a bastard, you know. Why don’t you leave the girl alone? Simple as that. Your surname, name, patronymic. Panova Yekaterina Mikhailovna. Where do you work? A clothes presenter in a fashion house. I’ve never thought it could be called a job. Are you married? - My husband perished. - I see. Do you know where you are? You are in a psychiatric hospital. I am the Chief Doctor. My name is Zinaida Alekseevna Ivanova. We are going to treat you. No. I don't need any treatment. I am not insane. I am healthy. Can a healthy person cripple her face like that? It was Shnyrev who did it. - Yulia, please, put in order... - It was Shnyrev who did it. - And then come to my office. - It was Shnyrev, can you hear me? Listen, it was all done by Shnyrev. You know it all, you are acting in concert. It was done by Shnyrev... Please untie me. No, don’t. I can’t take these drops. I’m begging you. Don’t give them to me. I can’t take them. Please don’t. Hush. Don’t wriggle. - May I come in? - Yes. Come in. It looks like we’ll have hard times with this Panova. What’s happened to her? She’s gone off her mind over her fame. I had a call from KGB. They asked to put Panova under special supervision. It’s a pity. She was so beautiful. Keep a close eye on her. Stop any contacts with relatives. Immediately inform me about any psychic deviations. Got it? Yes, Zinaida Alekseevna. Well, so what. We’ll treat her until she turns into a vegetable. You can go. Is that your dirty article? Yes. Why have you done that to her? Is there any other way? Yekaterina Panova disgraced the image of a Soviet woman. As I remember, you wrote about Felix Krutskiy as well. A while back. Well, Yura, are we going? That’s our job. A dirty one. Help me! What have you put on yourself? Come on, stand up. - What’s that? - A dress. Get out of here. Sit down. Your bed... Hush. Get out of here. Off you go! A dress... Look, a dress... A button. Styopa, I’m totally confused. Is it one hour before meals - or one hour after meals? - Let me see. - What are you reading? - A newspaper. Give it to me. Gosh, this is Katya! What? Well, that’s ridiculous! Vera, do calm down. It’s a misunderstanding. We’ll check it out now. Comrade Trofimov? Hello. Good afternoon, Vera Ivanovna. - I’m glad you’ve recognized me. - How are you? Nothing to complain about. I’m doing fine. Anatoly Ilyich, I am calling on a personal business. I think you know that we, the old Leninists, do not separate the personal from the social and the social from the personal. - Is that so? - Of course. I understand you. Yes. I am glad you agree with me. Well, a friend of my niece Marianna, you probably heard about her, An actress... Yes, that’s right, an actress. Katya Panova. Yes. I know. The wife of a traitor to our country. The scandal with her husband has no relation to her. The poor girl fell victim to man’s folly. But you know where she is now. She is currently in a psychiatric hospital. But it would be much better for her to receive treatment at home. That’s not a decision to be made by us. She should ask specialists. And I do fear her request will be declined. Yes. But this is still within the psychiatrists’ competence. There are relevant instances. Listen, I am calling you, ot the instances. Dear Vera Ivanovna. This is out of my competence. - So you’re refusing to help me? - Of course, I’m not. Stepan Arkadievich, can you hear it, he’s refusing me in … Vera Ivanovna, I’ll try to sort it out. So will you put this matter on notice? - I’ll give you assistance. - And give assistance. I’ll do my best, Vera Ivanovna, of course. I am very grateful to you, Anatoly Ilyich. Goodbye. Goodbye. Don’t put Nechaeva through to me any more. Work. Was it Shnyrev who did it? Dina, what do you want? Are you here to enjoy a triumph? I would have probably done so under other circumstances. However now, my soul is wounded same as yours. Between us, there can be nothing in common. Now we have one common enemy. This is Shnyrev. He has used me and then threw away like a cloth. My congratulations… It was me who hinted him about bringing down Krutsky the Senior and taking his place. Therefore, he planted the documents to Felix. These were the damaging materials against his father. Then they decided to use you. In London, he showed Felix the photos where the German is putting the make on you, and persuaded him that you were not faithful. And Felix stayed in London. And this accident with Felix is also Shnyrev’s business. Bitch. You’re such a bitch. Why are you telling me all that, eh? I just wanted you to know everything. So you wanted me to know everything. And why are you so kind, Dina? Felix had died because of you?! Slut! Pest on you! Got it? I hate you! Thank you. How many weeks? No weeks at all… I’ve just got poisoned with something. Do I look like a fool? I am a nurse. Do you understand that the drugs we are giving you may kill the baby? I am not your enemy. I just want to help. Everybody will find out sooner or later. If your chief doctor finds out that I am pregnant, she will kill the baby. A baby, a baby will be born. A baby will be born... So our patient is pregnant. Yes. A little baby will be born. All right, all right. Go. - Where? - There. Come on, go. Hello, this is Chief Doctor of the psychiatric hospital. Please put me through to comrade Shnyrev. Thank you. I’m holding the line... Hello, you asked me to inform you about Panova. I have some news. Katya is pregnant. What will the orders be? Zinaida Alekseevna, who is the doctor here? You or me? So make a decision. An abortion, of course. We can’t allow to deliver foreigners’ bastards. Excuse me. Goodbye. Olya, that’s nice. Make one more circle, and hold your back straight. Move from the hip, from the hip. Well, that’s a good girl. One more circle, yes. The back. Yes. Excellent. Well done. There, if you do well, you’ll get to the Fashion House. Yeah. Keep your chin higher. That’s a good girl. Yes. Good. Look, look. Get out. Look. Get out. Somebody, put him away. Look, this is your baby. Your little baby. I told them everything. Everybody knows. Look how little it is. Where are you... And where are we off to?
