That night, I dreamt of a woman I had seen a while before. I had crossed Paris to visit her. I went there because I was hanging on to something, because I had nothing else, an empty future. And I left with this ridiculous prediction: "A man, in September... "A man who would set me free." You can hold a masters in econometrics and applied statistics and consult fortune tellers. That night, Lila fell asleep right after we made love. She said "Thank you", then began snoring. Lila always snored when she'd been drinking. Lila said thank you for everything: thank you for the meal, for the night, for the weekend... But in reality, she didn't give a damn. UNDERGROUND TIME For a long time I wanted to know how it all started. The very beginning. How did it happen? How did it start? Each time I came back to that February morning. The head of a polling institute we had commissioned two months earlier had come to present the results of his survey. After the presentation, Jacques, who commissioned it, should have said something. Many of them are hesitating and getting it wrong. First, I'd like to thank Mr Semler for coming to present this project, and to congratulate him for his very precise analysis. I now hand over to Mr Pelletier, whom I also thank for his trust in me, despite the internal debates prompted by the innovative methodology used to conduct this study. Thank you. Except that I think the study's conclusions are wrong. I don't doubt the reliability of your results, but if you don't take into account the lack of knowledge of EU action in the areas of consumer information and protection as well as the price of organic food relative to the various sales outlets, the presence of a label identifying those products would be utterly pointless. Well... With all due respect to the doubts expressed by our marketing director, I think Mr Semler's suggestions deserve consideration, first, because of recent market trends, and because all of our internal studies came to the same conclusions. - Goodbye. Thank you. - Thank you. How do you think it went? - All right? - Yes. Was I too hard on Jacques? Did I overstep the mark? You did the right thing. - It was good. - OK. Before I met Lila, I had never loved in that way: a constant state of loss, a feeling of abandonment. But I had lived enough to know that what we had wasn't love, and that to preserve my self-respect, I had to put an end to it. Morning. As absurd as it might appear, before that meeting, nothing was wrong. Everything was normal. It took me several weeks to realise that Jacques' attitude toward me had changed. - Hello? - Hello, Mathilde? Yes? Mr Pelletier asked me to cancel your lunch tomorrow. Shall we postpone it? He didn't mention it. Fine. Then he decided that the few minutes we spent together each morning on current projects were a waste of time. Just manage on your own, and ask me if necessary. But the following Monday, he came to the planning meeting I ran every week, which he hadn't attended in ages. So that we have time to get replies to the invitation... He asked for copies of certain documents, checked the work of our product-development heads, and reviewed resource allocation on our projects. - Mathilde. - Yes? - Did you write this report? - Yes. Why? No reason. - What's going on? - What's up with him? He systematically questioned my decisions, asked for details, expressed recriminations. Then he started attending every Monday planning meeting. What are our true ambitions? It made no sense, and I assumed that Jacques was going through a bad time. I even imagined he was ill. A disease that was silently eating away at him. I refused to betray him and told no-one. I kept quiet. But Jacques' odd behaviour continued, forgetting to invite me to the unveiling of the ad campaign that our agency had done for a new range of products. Really? You weren't told? No! Hello. I moved here in 1970 and converted to organic farming around 15 years later. It was a long road that brought me here. - He's good. - Very good, yes. That's when I realised that his efforts to undermine me weren't limited to our department, but that he had discredited me elsewhere. Jacques, I need to show you the new mail shots. You haven't approved them. This isn't the time. I've got a busy week. We'll talk later. OK? Thanks. Finally I cracked and burst into his office to demand an explanation. I've no idea what you mean. Really I don't. Everything is perfectly normal. I'm doing my job, that's all. You must realise that I don't have time for your mood swings. It's true. What's wrong with you? Have you done something wrong? Need a holiday? It's been a tough year, it's true. It's only natural you're burnt out. You're looking tense, tired... No-one's indispensable, you know that. Just take a few days off, and you'll see things more clearly. From that day on, Jacques stopped talking to me and communicated with me only via email. I'd met Lila 2 years earlier at the bar des Oies. Before then, we had only met near my place, by the swimming pool or near the baker's. But this time we were so close we couldn't miss each other. After that we just kept seeing each other, as many times as we could. Yes, lovely. Once you've seen the port and Erik Satie's house, there's not much left to do. What's the weather like in Nantes? No... How many of you were there? And they said nothing? Er... I don't know. I'd like to move on. Go to New York, maybe. I've a friend there and she'd lend me her apartment. You're so clumsy! We'd had other weekends like this one. But this time it seemed we'd reached a limit, a saturation point beyond which it was impossible to go. Lila... what I'm about to say may seem harsh... maybe even cruel... but our relationship can't continue like this. It's over between us. We have to stop seeing each other. Lila. Yes? I have to... I have to go and pay the bill. - See you in the car? - I'll be down in 5 minutes. Shit, I'll never do it. Your call is the next in the queue. Please hold the line. - Hello? - Rose, hello. It's Thibault. Yes, Thibault. Sorry but I'll be half an hour late. Don't worry, we can cope. The rush hasn't started yet. - OK. Thanks, that's good of you. - You're welcome. - Take care. - You too. See you later. - Can I put the radio on? - Of course. Thanks. Mum, it's 7 o'clock! Shall I wake the twins? Yes, and tell them to get their gym stuff ready. OK. What if it was just a question of language? Maybe Lila was just like that, and her indifference to affection was simply her nature, a given that I had to accept and about which I could do nothing. Or maybe her attitude was reserved for me, a silent way of reminding me where we both stood. Shit, shit! - Hello, Mum. - Careful, you'll cut yourselves! Sit down, I'll be right there. On Mondays the twins started school at eight, but that Monday I'd have given anything not to go to work. At first I told them I had problems at work, but they'd pass, and tried to explain the situation in a language they could understand: my boss, the woman who runs personnel, the man who looks after advertising, the big, big boss... But it was like telling them a story about murderous Smurfs killing each other silently in a village cut off from the world. Help yourself. Let's go, boys. Come on. Have a good day, darlings. Bye, Mum. See you tonight. - Give me a kiss. - Bye, Mum. - Be good. - Yes. Don't fight on the way. Simon! Welcome to Medical Emergencies. If you wish to see a doctor or need medical advice, press 1. If you have called before and wish to make a change, press 2. If you're calling about an administrative problem, press 3. Shit, my keys... Most mornings, on the platform of Bonne-Nouvelle Station, I saw the same people waiting, like me, always in the same place. It was already 29th September and nothing suggested an event that could change the course of my life. Lila. Yes? We have to stop seeing each other. I can't go on like this. I just can't. I'm tired. OK. Thanks. Thanks for everything. Your call is the next in the queue. Please hold the line. - Hello? - Hello, Rose? It's Thibault. - Yes? - I'm here. Good. Where do you want to start? I have 2 visits: one in the 13th and one in the 11th. I'm nearer the 11th. Headaches and coughing fits, avenue Parmentier, 50-year-old woman. OK, I'll take it. OK. See you later. - Hello. - You again? - Sorry? - I'm right! You were here two weeks ago. Are you sure? Well, yes. I don't have Alzheimer's yet. - Do come in. - Thanks. Go through! - This way. - Right. Breathe in. Breathe out. Cough. And again. - Turn round, please. - It hurts here. Right here. - Did you keep my last prescription? - Yes. - Could I see it? - Yes, of course. Here. Dr Thibault Béranger Are you OK, madam? Do you need help? Oh, dear... Do you want to get off? Let's get off. I'll get off with you. Breathe deeply. We're nearly there. Let us through, please. Let us get to the door, please. Come on, madam. Let's sit down here. Are you OK? Shall I get you something to eat or drink? No, thank you. I have to go. I'm going to be late. Just my luck. I just found a temp job, but... I can't get back on the train. I can't. What's the matter? I'm claustrophobic. Normally I'm OK, but with all those people... Go and get help. - You'll stay with her? - Yes. Thibault, I just got a call about a panic attack, Charonne Metro station. - Are you still nearby? - Can't the fire brigade go? No. There's a fire in rue Saint-Maur, and the ambulance is snowed under. - Thibault? - OK. I'll take it. - Thanks. - You're welcome. See you later. The doctor's here. He's on his way down. I'm sorry, I have to go. I'm already late. Will you be OK? Thank you. Just breathe slowly. You have too much oxygen in your system. This will help balance you out. Just breathe a little more carbon dioxide... and that will calm you down. I sometimes thought of the girl who joined my school in my final year. She was from Caen. Or was it Alençon? It was odd thinking of her. Thinking of her more than 20 years on, 25 even, back when my left hand still had five fingers. Excuse me. Do you when the RIVA suburban train arrives? You've missed it. Just hop on the ROVO or the ROPO trains. The BIP, the RIP and the ZIP are non-stop to Villeneuve, and the NOVO... only stops at Maisons-Alfort. - So the ROVO or the ROPO. - ROVO or ROPO, OK. Thank you. Have a nice day. I sometimes wondered if it would be easier to stay there underground and wait for the hours to pass. In any case, I had nothing to do any more. Jacques had so isolated me that no-one spoke to me or came into my office for fear of reprisals. I did have one ray of hope, when Jacques' PA called me. Hello, Mathilde? It's Barbara. Jacques agreed to write an article for the in-house journal on product innovation for Taste Week, but he's been held up and won't have time. He wanted me to ask you to write it. The article must be on his desk on Monday morning. The timing could have been better, but still... Like an idiot, I agreed and said I'd cope somehow. Sure you won't come with us? Mum, I told you, I can't, I'm... Tell Marie and Georges I'll call them this evening. Mum. Thanks. I worked all weekend, and on Sunday evening e-mailed the article to Jacques with a feeling of achievement I hadn't known in long time. My article! Where's my article? I e-mailed it to you. Didn't you get it? No! I didn't get anything! Not a thing! I waited all morning. I looked for you everywhere. I had to cancel a lunch to write the bloody thing which I asked you to write on Friday night! I suppose you had better things to do than devote a few hours to the company. Jacques, I sent it to you. If I hadn't, I'd tell you. You can no longer be trusted. From Mathilde Debord: Article Sunday 7/9/14 at 7:41 pm There it is. - Jacques... - No! I didn't receive anything, and to hell with your probity! ...southbound trains from Paris serving Maisons-Alfort, Le Vert de Maisons, Créteil Pompadour and Villeneuve-Triage will not stop at those stations, and from 23:10, inbound trains will start from Villeneuve-Saint-Georges. - Hello, Thibault? - Yes, Rose. We have a problem. Can you take sector 3 as well as 4? - Why, what's wrong? - Frazera's broken his wrist. We can't find anyone to replace him. - Isn't Didier in Paris? - No. He's stuck in Marseille because of the strikes. OK, I'll take it. But I'm knocking off at seven. Thanks, Thibault. I owe you one. You're welcome. Café de la Gare - Hello. All right? - Fine. You? Yes. You weren't here for the loto on Friday. No. I took the twins to Versailles. Was it good? Yes, but it rained all day. Oh... - You're a bit off-colour today. - Yes. Right now I'm off-colour every day. Not true. The other day with your flowery dress on, it was like spring had arrived. Right, Laurent? To Mum Mum, I'm giving you my Argent Defender card. It's rare, but it's OK. I have two. It's a hero card that will protect you all your life. Morning. Mathilde, hold on. I'm sorry I didn't call you to warn you. I think he's replaced you. - What? - Friday, when you weren't here, the trainee in communications took your office. They took your things and moved her in instead of you. They said they're making her permanent. - In what job? - They wouldn't tell me. Thank you. Hello. Mr Pelletier, Mathilde Debord is here. I'm on my way. Is there a problem? You're two hours late. Yes... I mean, no... Are you feeling better? I hope you had a good rest. Only you've been looking tired recently. As you can see, we've made some changes in your absence. I've sent a memo laying out the aims of the new organisation, which includes a new office layout to improve the flow of information. Also, it's my pleasure to welcome Corinne Santos, who joined us this morning. Corinne has the same training as you. She spent several months at Nestlé working internationally, and has just completed a communications internship, where she performed miracles. She's going to help us roll out the product plan. You'll find the memo in your pigeonhole. In your absence, I took the liberty of moving your things to room 509, the empty office. Rather than disconnect and re-connect everything, Corinne will be using your computer. Nathalie copied your personal folders onto a disk. You can ask her for it. IT should be able to sort you out a new workstation before too long. Any questions? Eh? - Rose, it's Thibault. - Yes? After rue Bobillot and avenue Dorian, I'm going to rue Sarrette. Does Francis want me to cover both sectors all day? I don't know what's going on. It's been crazy for two hours. We've got calls everywhere, and the ambulance service has us running all over the place. If you like I've got a 15th, rue Sicard. A man having a delirious episode. His wife called. Can you take it? Yes, OK. I'll take it. OK. Great. I'll send you the info. See you later. OK, thanks. See you later. Keep your hair on... In my 2nd year at medical school, when I went home to my parents, I'd have a drink on Saturday with my old school friends. Then we'd go to the Marichavry in Pierre's van. That night, Pierre and I fell out over nothing. It got out of hand: something erupted between us out of nowhere. Shut your mouth. It's none of your business. Shut your mouth. - You, get out. - Come on... I won't get in the van until you get out. I'll... - Shit... - OK, I'll get out. - What? - Shit! Open it from outside! I'm trying to, it's stuck! I'm sorry, Thibault. Sorry. Thibault, calm down. I don't know how long it went on. Half an hour, an hour... Maybe longer. But I know that when they got it open, my hand was literally flattened. Your little finger and ring finger have no blood supply and are too damaged to be repaired. We'll have to amputate them. That's when my dreams of being a surgeon were... crushed. After my internship, I replaced the doctor in my home village, one week a month and two months in summer. When he died, I took over his practice. Events could have taken their course. I'd have married Isabelle, the notary's daughter, or Élodie, the insurance agent's daughter. We'd have had 3 kids, I'd have expanded my practice, bought an MPV, found a locum for the summer. Things would have been easier. But after 4 years I'd had enough. I sold the practice, packed my bags and left for Paris. Yes, Simon. What's happening? The maths teacher's away. Can I eat at Hugo's place? I'll come back to school this afternoon. I don't mind, but don't hang around in Sébastopol. OK, I promise. How did your test go this morning? - Fine, but his mum's waiting. Of course. See you tonight, then. - OK. Love you. - Love you. Philippe died 10 years ago. For 10 years, his death had been part of me. For the first time since the twins' birth, we'd gone away for the weekend without the kids, just us. Théo and Maxime had just turned one, and we'd left them with Philippe's parents in Normandy. I'd booked a hotel in Honfleur. When I went back down, Philippe had lost consciousness. He died three days later. I had just turned thirty. After the funeral, the boys and I moved in with my mother. I thought I could have spent the rest of my life there, looked after, sheltered from the world, with nothing to do but listen to my sorrow. And then one day, I felt afraid. So little by little I re-learned... ...everything. To eat, to sleep, to look after the boys... And finally to work. And 10 years later, Philippe's death was less a pain than an absence I had learned to live with, a stupid bastard in a 3-piece suit was destroying me. My husband's in the bathroom. When I said you were coming, he called me a bitch. Now he won't answer me. When did the crisis start? Er... A few days ago. He threw out everything in the fridge, saying it was poisoned. Then he kept checking that the gas was turned off. He refuses to turn on the light, sit, lie down... He spent last night standing in the hall. Then this morning, after explaining that the forces of evil were invading the house via the phone, he locked himself in the bathroom. Has he been hospitalised before? Well, yes. Several times. For depression. I see. He said he's going to do himself in to protect me and my daughter. He wants me to leave the apartment, to go as far away as possible so as not to be contaminated by his blood. He's just waiting for me to leave. - Aren't you at school? - No. I couldn't take her and leave my husband alone. Go to your room. I have things to say to your mum. Is that OK? Go on, go and play in your room. Hello. After the tone, this call will be charged at 34 cents a minute, plus the cost of a mobile call. Terms and prices are available on 30 08. Welcome to Paris Health Insurance. Press 1 for an existing case, press 2 if you are a member or 3 if you wish to join. Please hold. A counsellor will be with you shortly. I'll try and persuade your husband to go to hospital. He'll probably have to be committed, and you'll need to sign. Do you agree to that? Sir? Can you hear me? It's the doctor. I don't need a doctor. Your wife told me you'd been poisoned by gas. Are you feeling better? Hello. Can I come in? Thanks. Don't be afraid. I'm just here to help you. I'm going to listen to your lungs... to check everything's OK. Do you mind? Breathe normally. Breathe in. Cough. Cough again. Your lungs are congested. It's best you get them checked in hospital. I'll give you an injection to relieve you. OK? Good. This will sting a bit. Hello. They told me you'd changed offices. I didn't know. I wasn't here on Friday. I must admit... I just found out. Yes. Me too. I see you have no workstation. We'll take care of that. It's just a temporary solution. I... We'll find... Did you pass Jacques' office? Yes. - Was he there? - Yes. Did you speak to him? No. I wanted to see you first. OK. Fine. I'm going to call him. I'll call him in front of you and ask to speak to him for the tenth time, because I'd like to know what to do. Do you see? What kind of work can I do in an office with no computer, without having been to any meetings, without having been copied in on any e-mail for over a month? - You don't know? - No. Nor do I. I'm going to ask Jacques Pelletier to come here, because he's my line manager. I'm going to tell him that you've come down, and I'm going to ask him to join us. Don't worry, Patricia, he never answers. But you'll see when you pass his office that he's there, and you'll understand the situation. Hold on. You never know. Jacques complained you'd been aggressive to him. He says it's become difficult to communicate with you, that you show strong signs of resistance, that you're not on-message with the direction of the team or the company. Is that right? Look, I don't know what to say... It's been 3 months since I had a conversation worthy of the name with Jacques Pelletier, and nearly a month since he last spoke to me. Apart from this morning, to tell me he'd given me this office next to the men's toilets. So I really don't see what he means. Right. I... I mean, we'll resolve this problem. Of course, you're only here temporarily. This can't go on. I can't go on, Patricia. I want you to know that, it's important. I can't take any more. There. I... I've reached the limit of what I can bear. I've done everything in my power to sort things out. I've been patient. I've tried to get a grip on myself, really I have. But now I can't take any more. So you... I can't take any more. I understand, Mathilde. This office with no window, no light, so far away... You know very well it's not about the office! I want to work. I'm paid ?3,000 a month and I have no work. I want to work, not change offices. I'll take care of it. We'll find a solution. I'll start by calling IT so that they send someone to install a computer. I'll take care of it. Can you get in on your own, sir? Yes? I'll help you. - Hello, Rose? It's Thibault. - Have you finished? Yes. Are you OK? Have things calmed down a bit? Yes, a little. Just to please you, I've got another job in the 15th. Mrs Bernard. Her baby has a temperature of 39ºC. What do you think? It's hard to say with her. OK. I'm nearby, I'll call in. She's starting to get on my nerves. In any case, she won't see anyone but you. OK, great! I'll call you when I'm done. - Oh, hello. - Hello. Yes, please come in. Hot today, isn't it? - It's going to last all week. - Lucky us. Right... There you go. Hey! You can't park there! You can't do whatever you like just because you're a doctor. There you go. By default, you're linked to the laser printer on this floor. If you want to print in colour you'll need to select another. - OK. - There you go. Ah! The Argent Defender! You're lucky. My son would sell both his parents for that card. - Is it yours? - Yes. My son had two and gave it to me. - I'll buy it off you. - No, I couldn't. Come on. 10 euros. I'm sorry, I can't. - 20. - No! It was a gift, and anyway I really need it. OK. - Have a nice day. - Yes. Thanks. OK, put him down. Don't put it in your mouth. It's to listen to your heart and lungs. Can I have it back? Let's look in your mouth now. Super. There's nothing to worry about. Give him paracetamol every 6 hours for the fever. Maybe a tepid bath if his temperature is too high. Call me in two days if he still has a fever. - Hello, Lætitia? - Yes. It's Mathilde. Fancy lunch? Sorry, I can't today. I've got a dental appointment. - I hope you don't mind. - No. I saw Patricia on her way up. Did she come to see you? Yes. She said she was going to try and find a solution. It's time she faced up to the problem. I know she's caught between two stools, but she has to choose, take responsibility. She won't be able to look after the fox and the goose. The fox ate the goose a long time ago. I've got another call. I'll call you when you're back from the dentist. OK. Take care. Mathilde, it's Patricia. I've sent your CV to all the group's subsidiaries, and I've had several job offers that might interest you. I'm going to see Jacques to discuss it with him. We'll get this sorted out. - Hold on! - Yes? I wanted to say, maybe I didn't understand your problems soon enough and I'm sorry. But I want you to know I'm taking care of it, I'm making it my responsibility. Goodbye. - Hello. - What can I get you? A ham sandwich and a beer, please. - Enjoy your meal. - Thanks. Hello, sir. - Enjoy your meal. - Thanks. - A coffee afterwards - Yes. How should I know if I'm well or not? What's it all for, what's it all about? With all the crap that's going on! I don't believe in it any more. You're right: I don't believe in it. Stop it! Enough. I'm scared. That's right. Exactly. Yes... That's right. OK. - Maybe I shouldn't laugh... - She's great. - What do you think? - Wow! It's great. It suits you. Did you buy it at the weekend? Yes, but I already had it in grey and black. I felt terrible when I got home. Not at all. Your purchasing strategy is perfectly logical. Your approach to clothing is very consistent: you always buy the same thing. Are you going to see Paul Vernont? You need a union behind you. You can't do it alone. The guy's crazy, and he hasn't finished. You won't escape that easily. It won't get better on its own. - This office is a disgrace! - Wait. Patricia just called. She's taken things in hand. She's trying to find me another job. Everything will be OK. I hope so. But you mustn't give in. Protect yourself, act like the war's going to go on. Prepare for the worst. Be careful. The war... Promise me you'll see Paul, even if just for advice. You have to get help. Don't go it alone. What's that smell? Air freshener. Right, I'm off. Lætitia had a simple vision of the company, similar to the one that rules Azeroth. Once, her way of dividing the world in two amused me. Now I wonder if she wasn't right. You absolutely must not resign, whatever happens and on no account. You must keep records of everything, note every detail, describe factually what has changed, the objective development of the situation. I suggest you write a sort of chronology that recaps the deterioration of your relationship with Jacques, stage by stage, noting the key dates. You must compile a dossier. A week had gone by and I hadn't done it. I hadn't written the document he'd asked me for, and I hadn't told Lætitia because I no longer had the strength. Because it was too late. - Éric. - Yes? Can you come in for a minute? I want to talk to you. - What, now? - Yes. Please sit down. - Here? - Yes. Éric, I'd like to ask you something. Yes? Could you write a letter with some precise, concrete facts? Not a letter against Jacques or against anyone, more like an account of the current situation. For example, that I no longer have control of the team, I don't run the planning meeting, that I'm not involved in any decisions... That kind of thing, to record that I'm not involved any more. I can't, Mathilde. You know I can't risk losing my job. A letter like that... My wife's pregnant, she's stopped working. You're asking me for a report. Look... I'm sorry but I can't. - I understand. - I can't. - I'm really sorry. - It's OK, no problem. - Hello, Rose? - No. Rose has gone home. - This is Audrey. - Hello. It's Thibault. Hi, Thibault. I'm at rue Villemain. Got anything that's not too far? I've got one in the 11th district and one in the 13th. - Want the 13th? - OK. 13th is good. 92-year-old woman. Fell and was injured. - OK, I'll take it. I'm on my way. - OK. See you later. See you later. The codes... IT, can I help? This is Mathilde. You installed a PC for me this morning. Yes? I have a slight problem: when I try to access the marketing directory, I get an error message on my screen. - Did you click on the icon? - Well, yes. - Hold on, I'll check. - OK. It's nothing to do with your PC. You don't have authorisation to access that directory. Sorry? We got a memo on Friday and you're no longer on the list. What? What list? Each department has been asked to update its access authorisations at directory and sub-directory level. The request from your team doesn't give you access to that directory. But... Who signed the document? - The manager, I expect. - Yes, but which one? - Mr Pelletier. - Oh, no! I... I can't believe it... Right. Come on... - Hello? - It's Mathilde. Yes? Apparently you've denied me access to the departmental directory. That's right. Patricia told me you've asked for a transfer, so for obvious reasons, I can't give you the same access as the other team members. You know that our marketing policy obeys particular constraints of confidentiality, in-house included. Wait, Jacques. Give me 5 minutes, we need to talk. I wouldn't have asked for a transfer if things hadn't gone this far... Well, that's the result. Let's not go back over what happened in the past. We both have better things to do. No, Jacques, that's just it. You know very well I have nothing to do. Don't talk to me like that. What... You have no right to speak to me like that! Don't talk to me like that, Mathilde! I am your direct superior! You've no right to speak to me like that, Mathilde! What's got into you? You're becoming coarse, and I refuse to have this conversation with you! - Hello. - Hello. - Mrs Driesman? - Yes. - I'm the doctor. - Come in. Thank you. - How are you? - Hello, doctor. Hello, Mrs Driesman. Let me help you. There you go, sit down. Thank you. So, Mrs Driesman, what's the problem? I'm tired, doctor. Since when? Oh... I don't know. - I'm going to examine you. - Yes. Give me your finger. This one. Good. Do you live alone? Yes. My husband died in 2002. Do you have children? I have a son. - Does he come to see you? - Eh? Does your son come to see you? No. No, he lives in London. - I'm going to check your heart. - Yes. That's all fine. Do you go out at all? Yes. Did you go out yesterday? No. - And the day before? - No. When did you last go out, Mrs Driesman? Oh... The best thing would be to go to hospital. No! I don't want to go to hospital! I want... I want to stay here, in my apartment. Just as you wish, Mrs Driesman. That is your right. I'll need to get the lab to call... Yes. ...and do a blood test. Do you agree to that? - Yes. - Yes? Yes, of course. I have to check that you can stay at home, without help. Yes. I want to stay at home. That's all. I want to die at home. Doors closing. Doors opening. Ground floor. His figures were good last month. He's doing well. What's happened now? Audrey, it's Thibault. I'm leaving Mrs Driesman. Her condition is worrisome. I've not been able to reach her son, but I've asked the lab to do a blood test. Can you tell me when the results are in? - OK. - Thanks. See you later. I can't believe it. For things to get this out of control, there must have been something between you. No. There's never been any ambiguity between us. Are you sure? Even when you both stayed late at the office... When you had lunch or dinner together? No, I'm telling you. Even when travelling, in a car, on a train, in a plane, there was never any ambiguity, no inappropriate touching or words. He was the perfect gentlemen. Perhaps you don't remember, but there must have been some detail you've missed which, in hindsight, proves that he had feelings for you. He addressed me informally once or twice, but that's hardly proof. No. And after eight years, it makes no sense. He took you under his wing from the start. He made you his closest collaborator, his right hand even, when we know he doesn't trust people easily. That means something. How do you explain it? He's singled me out, that's all. Exactly. During your job interview, what did you both say? I did all the talking. He asked the questions. OK, but how did it go? Same as the others. I didn't say I was a widow, just that I was a single parent. - Why? - Why? Because it's the truth. I didn't want to arouse pity or compassion. And when he hired you, did you tell them? Yes, but just in conversation, without going into detail. It was on a train to Marseille. We'd been working together for a year. He remained discreet, and didn't change his behaviour towards me, and that's important. Though he annoyed me outside work, sometimes drove me up the wall, professionally I couldn't fault him. You see? The man taught me everything. No. I keep turning things over in my mind, but I always come back to the presentation in February. I didn't think it could be that. - Hello? - Yes, is this IT? Yes. What is it? Could I speak to the man who came to my office earlier? He was tall with wavy hair and a white shirt. He's on a call. I'll get him to call you back. OK, thanks. Ever wanted to get married? No. Well, I don't think so. Why do you ask? Don't worry, it's just a question. In any case, I couldn't wear a wedding ring. And you? - What about me? - Have you ever wanted to marry? Once, yes. - To whom? - I don't want to talk about it. Why not? I said I don't want to talk about it. Do you have a problem? Well, yes. Look. When I turn it on, I get this. That's nothing. I'll reboot it. It just happens. But I'll need to... Oh, yes. Sorry. I went out for some air for about 20 minutes. Do you think that while I was gone, someone could have tampered... I mean... interfered with my PC? No! It's nothing like that. It's a configuration problem. - Really? - Yes. I can assure you. There, it's working. - So it is. - Yes. - Thanks. - You're welcome. By the way, about the card, I'll talk to my son and see if it's possible. For your son, we'll see what we can do. Ah! OK. That's great, thanks. - Bye. - Bye. - Yes? - Hello, Mathilde? Yes. A vacancy has come up in the research centre of a subsidiary. A senior role in the New Products and Sensory Studies Department, including the direct management of a team of four. The post's been vacant for two weeks for lack of an ideal candidate to be promoted internally. Given the economic situation, external recruitment was out. So I sent them your CV and called the director, as I know him personally. Obviously I recommended you. They're looking at one or two other candidates, but it seems that your profile is the best match. I was most insistent. I'll hear back very soon. He needs someone urgently. The post can't remain vacant long. I didn't think it necessary to mention your current problem, as it would have put you at a disadvantage. You've been with us for eight years, so it's quite legitimate that you'd want a change. I assume you're interested? Er... Yes, yes! I'm very interested! I'll call you when I have news. Goodbye. OK. Thank you. Goodbye. - Hello. - Hello. - Would you like a cigarette? - Thanks, but I don't smoke. I just wanted to get some air. My name's Élisabeth. What's yours? Mathilde. Which department do you work in? Marketing, for now. - Been here long? - Yes. Eight years. I've been here two months. - And do you like it? - I love it. It's exactly the job I wanted. Have you tried the gym classes? Yes. I used to go to the sports centre on avenue Leclerc. But I don't go any more. And is the pool at the aquatic centre good? The pool... Yes. It's a 25-metre pool. It's open lunchtimes. Very handy. I'll have to go. - See you soon. - See you soon. - I hope to see you again. - Yes. - Hello? - Are you Mathilde Debord? Yes. Hello. I'm the director of the FlavaTech Centre. I have your CV here and I wanted to know if it was possible to meet. Yes, of course. When is convenient? The sooner the better. Does tomorrow work for you? Yes, yes. Where are you? In the 14th arrondissement, near Porte de Vanves. But I was wondering: are you the Mathilde Debord who wrote a series of articles in the group journal? Yes, that was me. Then I'm delighted to know you. I confess that I always look out for your name. It's a shame you don't write any more. I suppose you don't have the time. It's the same for us all: nose to the grindstone. I'd be delighted to meet you tomorrow, if that's OK. I'll be in a meeting all afternoon, so would 6.30 suit you? - Yes, that's fine. - That's perfect, then. I won't keep you any longer. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. You have 1 new message Interview information and directions FlavaTech Research Centre Right. Hello. It's the doctor. - The building across the yard. - Thank you. - Yes? - Which floor? - Seventh. - Thanks. Hello, Théo? Yes. Did you get back OK? Good. Can you put Maxime on? No, don't disturb him. Just tell him I found his letter and I was very pleased. That's right. OK. Me too. Yes, me too. See you tonight, darling. I have to go. See you tonight. This is Simon's voicemail. Please leave a message after the tone. Simon, it's Mum. Don't be late back from judo, the twins are at home and I don't want to leave them too long. Don't let me down. See you tonight. - Hello. - Hello. - A coffee, please. - Sure. - Where is the washroom? - Right there. Thanks. I must have misunderstood. Can you repeat what you just said? Jacques Pelletier asked HR to send you, by recorded delivery, a warning letter which he wrote himself. He mentioned instances of verbal aggression against him, insults that you hurled at him and that you had slammed the phone down on him. Hold on, I'll read it to you. He complains about your systematic opposition to the direction and strategy of the business. He also describes, with several examples, your self-inflicted isolation and refusal to communicate. The warning doesn't entail disciplinary measures, but it will be kept on file. It could be a determining factor in dismissal procedures for gross misconduct or a suspension. Moreover, Jacques formally opposed a transfer of any kind. The loss of a manager would jeopardise the team. He refuses to contemplate your departure until a new recruit has been trained. In his view, no transfer can be considered for four to five months. Yes... Sorry, I've got another call. I'll stop by later. Don't do anything till I see you. See you later. Verbal aggression Intimidation Jacques, I need to talk to you. I don't have time. You can't do this. We have to talk. Jacques, don't do this. Don't do it. Mr Pelletier won't be back today or tomorrow. He's away for 4 days. Hello. Can you let me in, please? Press the button and speak. - Can you hear me? - When you press it, yes. Hello. I'm a doctor. I'm here for a consultation. I've not been informed, I can't let you in. Only pre-booked visitors are allowed in. There's nowhere to park within 500 metres. It's an emergency. I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do. Can you call Mr Verdier and check? I'm not paid to do that, sir. It'll cost you nothing to call him and check. Hello? This is the parking attendant. I have a doctor here who says he has an appointment with Mr Verdier. OK, I'll let him in. Thank you. You need to sign where it says, "Receipt acknowledged by". Just there. If you want to go back on this decision, I'll say I never had this letter in my hands. But you have had it. And you've just signed it. You're exhausted, Mathilde. You need to rest. We'll find a solution. Wait till I've talked to him. No. I need you to take this letter on board. To regard it as final and irrevocable. As you wish. We'll talk again. You're very pale. I want you to take a taxi home and call a doctor. Have him sign you off for a few days. You're all in. - I'm taking the train. - Take a taxi and charge it. You're in no fit state to take public transport. I'm taking the train. OK. But promise me you'll call a doctor as soon as you get home. Mathilde, you have to rest. Promise me. You can't go on. OK. I'll call an emergency doctor. Good. Are we responsible for what happens to us? Do we always get what we deserve? What do you mean? Do you think you can be a victim of something like this because you're weak, because deep down that's what you want? Do some people unwittingly mark themselves out as targets? No. I don't think so, no. I think it's your ability to resist that marks you out as a target. I've worked here for 20 years, Mathilde. It's not the first time I've encountered this kind of situation. You're not responsible for what's happening to you. OK. Good. Call a doctor. I'll need you to leave me your ID. OK. Mr Verdier? Your visitor has arrived. Thank you. Go up to the third floor. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Hello, doctor. - Hello. - Please take a seat. - Thank you. I've got a throat infection. I need some antibiotics. I respond well to Amoxicillin or Zithromax, if you prefer. I'll just examine you. I've had a lot of throat infections. My meeting starts in 4 minutes. Most throat infections are viral in origin. Antibiotics are useless. Misusing antibiotics increases resistance, leading to... I couldn't care less. I need to be better in 24 hours. Yellow Pages Welcome to Medical Emergencies. If you wish to see a doctor or need medical advice, press 1. If you have called before and wish to make a change, press 2. If you're calling about an administrative problem, press 3. - How much do I owe you? - 45 euros, please. For a 3-minute consultation with no prescription? I won't write prescriptions without examining. - Audrey? - Yes? - It's Thibault. - Yes? - I'm knocking off, I've had it. - What's wrong? - Is there a problem? - No, I'm OK. - Mande will take over. - OK, great. - Get some rest. - Yes. Have a good evening. - You too. See you tomorrow. - OK. Ciao. Some tall figures are fragile and attract one's eye. You were wearing a beige mac and standing near the edge, unsteady, half stumbling, which those around didn't seem to notice. I almost told you to move back, you were so close. Once on the train, I sat opposite you so as to continue watching you. - Why? - I don't know. I wanted to talk to you. I thought, I can't keep staring at the woman like this, and that I had left Lila. That September day was unlike the one I'd been told about. I could have cried, without restraint, quite openly, just let myself go. But my tears would have recalled others, and reminded me that I missed Philippe. After a moment, it seemed to me that your face was changing imperceptibly. Even if nothing had changed, it seemed... How can I put it? It seemed that we already shared something. Subtitles: Eclair Group
