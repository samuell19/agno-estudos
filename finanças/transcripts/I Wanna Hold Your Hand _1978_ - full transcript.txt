[street noises] [horns honking] [whistle blowing] [horns honking] - [man on ladder grunts] - [men chattering] - [man shouting instructions on stage] - [man 2 reviewing cues on PA] [chattering] [man] Where's Vito? - Vito! - [man 2] On stage! - [man] Huh? - [man 2] He's on the stage! - [ushers chattering] - [man reviewing cues] [chattering stops] Now, I know a lot of you are wondering about tomorrow night's show. Just who are these youngsters from Liverpool who call themselves the Beatles? Just what can we expect? Well, let me put it in perspective for you. You know, a few years ago we had a young vocalist on our stage by the name of Elvis Presley. He... A few of you may remember, he caused quite a sensational reaction among the youngsters in our studio audience. Well, tomorrow night, right here on our stage, we're going to have Elvis Presley times four. - [chattering, grumbling] - Are you kidding? I don't get paid enough... Oh, all right. Simmer down. - [chattering continues] - Simmer down. Simmer down. I know. A few weeks ago, I went to England, and I saw these four youngsters perform. Both Sylvia and I agreed that what they do to an audience is truly remarkable. So I want you to be prepared for excessive screaming, hysteria, hyperventilation, fainting, fits, seizures, spasmodic convulsions, even attempted suicides. All perfectly normal. It merely means that these youngsters are enjoying themselves. Now, I want you to remember that tomorrow night we're going out live, coast to coast, to 90 million viewers in the United States and Canada. So remember, nothing must interfere with our really big show.

[DJ on radio] All right, baby. - This is Murray the "K" with the #1 song... - Rosie, wait a minute. - ...on the morning show in radio... - Excuse me. Rosie, did you hear what I said? I've gotta start saving my money for more important things. I mean, for God sakes, tomorrow night I'm getting... you know. All right, I'll buy it for you as an elopement present. Shh! Do you want to tell the whole world? Anyway, if you're gonna get me something, get me something practical that I can use, like Tupperware. [screams] Oh, my God! Oh, my God, it's Paul!

You only think that you do. - [girl] Punch her out! - [loud chattering] Rosie, you're not buying another one. - It's not for me, it's for Pam. - Oh, I don't want it.

You are picketing in my store. You are driving my customers away. - Why? - All I see around this store is Beatle albums. What about Bob Dylan? Joan Baez? How come they don't get equal floor space? The Beatles sell. "Jane" Baez doesn't sell. I deserve a little more respect from my own daughter. You are embarrassing me. I'm embarrassing you? I feel like I'm talking to a walking publicity stunt! [girl] Hey, Janis! Janis! Have you seen Rosie? - [Murray the "K"] Hey, just a reminder... - Rosie! Rosie, it's your 12th busy signal. You're not gonna get through. Rosie! Excuse me. Rosie, I got something to tell ya. But I want you to promise me that you're not gonna scream and you're not gonna yell and you're not gonna faint. - Oh, my God, Grace, what? - You promise? I figured out a way to get into the Beatles' hotel. - [screams] - Damn, Rosie. Control yourself. There's still a hitch. We gotta raise $23. [muffled] Twenty-three dollars? See, we have to hire a limo, a limousine. It's the only thing that can pull up to the front of the Beatles' hotel without get stopped by cops. - How much money you got? - Uh... - I got three dollars' worth of dimes. - That's not enough, Rosie. Damn! But it's enough to hire a cab. We could drive up in a cab! No, I already found out the cops are checking the cabs. See, we need a limo, and we need it tonight. I mean, I got a deadline to meet. - Tonight? We can't go tonight. - [door closes] Aren't you guys forgetting about something? Aren't you forgetting about this? Oh, yeah, that. This is my last night as a single woman. We were gonna do something special. We were supposed to spend the night at Rosie's, and it was going to be like my shower or something. Oh, hey, Pam, what could be better than for all of us to drive up to the Beatles' hotel together and see the Beatles in person? Yeah! Right, Pam. How much money ya got? I'm about to be a married woman. I can't go chasing after the Beatles. And it's not fair to Eddie. Pam, I want you to know something. You don't seem to understand how important this is to me. I mean... I mean, I have got to get through to the Beatles. My entire career depends on it. If I could get exclusive pictures of the Beatles... I mean, they'd run my story on the front page of the Suburban. I mean, I might be able to sell it to Life magazine or something. Can you imagine that? [inhales deeply] Jesus Christ. I'm gonna suffocate in here. [Grace] Hey, Janis. Hey, Janis. You got any money? - What do you want money for? - Don't worry. It's for a good cause. Grace, there's Larry Dubois! - [no audible dialogue] - [girls squealing, screaming] - So what? - So, don't you know who Larry Dubois is? Yes, I do. He's the boy that threw up in biology. His father's got lots of limousines. He's an undertaker. [playing chords] Hi, Larry. I didn't know you played a musical instrument. - Yeah. - Oh, you're so musical. This is ridiculous. He'll never do it. Um, Larry, are you busy tonight? I don't know. - [cymbal crashes] - He'll do it. [tires squealing] - [gasps] - I just ran over a casket. - What was it doing out with the garbage? - Is that where it was? - Uh-huh. - Oh, whew. Well, it's okay. It's one of those discontinued models my father's throwin' out. You know, nobody was in it, so the garbage man will come and pick it up. Goodness, Larry, didn't you even take drivers ed, for goodness sakes? I told you I didn't have a driver's license. All's I got is a permit. [gasps] Look, Grace, we just better turn around right now. It's against the law to drive with a permit unless there is a licensed driver in the car. - I've got a license, Pamela. - You do? - But, Grace, I thought your birthday wasn't... - I don't have any insurance either. Relax, Larry. Look, I have absolute confidence in your ability to handle machinery. Any kind of machinery. I mean, I've seen you threading up those projectors in the AV room. - You're just the best. - Thanks. - Yeah, I'm pretty good on those Bell & Howells. - [Grace] Yeah. [radio: "Thank You Girl," louder] Rosie, are we gonna have to listen to the Beatles all the way to the city? You know, I swear, Janis, every time something popular comes along you automatically think they can't be any good. I don't know why we let her come in the first place. She's helping to pay for the gas, Rosie. Besides, someone's gotta be there to speak the truth. Say, Rosie, what do you think of my new sign? I think it's disgusting. Who do you think's gonna look at that anyways? The press, Rosie, the press. Hey, Larry, you like the Beatles, don't you? - Yeah, they're all right. They got a good beat. - Aw, they're the greatest. - I mean, "gearest." Here, have a jelly baby. - Yeah, what? A jelly baby. You know, jelly beans. They call them jelly babies in England. It's the Beatles' favorite food. You know what their favorite drink is? Coke. With a little bit of Scotch. Yeah. What am I doing here? Eddie is gonna kill me. He's gonna kill me. Eddie hates the Beatles. He's gonna think I'm immature. I just know it. Do we have to hear about Eddie all the way into the city? Pam, can I see your ring? Please, just for a minute. Well, all right, but be careful with it. What do you keep it in your boobs for? You're gonna lose it that way. You want my mother to see it? - Pam, you're so lucky. - Yeah, I guess. No, I mean it. I'll probably never get one of these. Oh, don't be silly, Rosie. It's no big deal. Yeah. Well, there's really only one guy I wanna marry anyways. - [sighs] Paul. - Paul? Paul who? Never mind. You don't know him. - Larry, I think we're being followed. - Oh, God, not the cops.

That was Peter, Paul and Mary. You and your stupid protest music. That's just boring. Did you ever listen to the words? You ought to try listening to the words sometime. Did you ever listen to the words to "Louie Louie"? - Oh, Smerko, leave me alone! - [Murray the "K"] Who's still up at this hour? I'm gonna find out by givin' away two Sullivan Show tickets to the first caller who can tell me which Beatle is left-handed. - All right! - Oh, my God! I know it! It's Paul! It's Paul! I know it!

Take her down to the lobby and turn her over to Sergeant Bailey. Okay, Lou. Never in my life have I seen such a disgusting display of vulgarity as I've witnessed in this hotel. Young girls screaming and running about... helter-skelter. You should be ashamed of yourself. And as for this hotel, I was not aware its clientele included such riffraff.

[all clamoring] [man] Yeah, Harry, my eyes were bothering me a little, with the reading I'm doing around here. So I went and I picked up this lamp. It's a real great lamp. I mean, it's got, like, three switches on it to make it bright. Great for reading. Yeah, that's right, Harry. Yeah, did they change... What the hell's the matter with you? [scoffs] Why don't you watch where you push that thing? Harry. Hello, Harry? Stupid kid. He broke my lamp.

I should've known this all along. You ain't nothin' but a Beatles lover. - Here. You take him. - [groans] Here's some great snapshots I got when the Beatles arrived at Kennedy Airport. Oh. Did you get any pictures of the Beatles? Yeah, well, I didn't exactly see the Beatles, but I got some great shots of their suitcases. Wow. You know, you're the first boy I ever met that I could really talk to. I mean, really talk to. Yeah, well, if you think these are fab, I'll show you something that's really gear! [radio] ♪ I'm in love with you ♪ Hey, don't they ever make the beds in here? Nah. The hotel doesn't know I'm in here. Then how'd you get this key? I found it. Someone left it in a door, and I found it. Then I took over the room. The hotel doesn't know I'm here. If they knew I was here, they'd throw me out. Now here. Look at this, look at this, look at this, look at this, look at this, look at this! Let me open this. This is my masterpiece. Know what this is? This is actually a clump of grass that Paul stepped on. I'm not exactly sure which blades he stepped on, but it's all in there. - That's why I got such a big clump. - Oh, wow. Can I have some of this? - What are you, crazy? - Just a little bit. I'll buy it off of ya. No, I'm sorry, but it's not for sale. Say, kid, do you really have tickets to The Ed Sullivan Show? Yeah. I sorta lucked into 'em. My uncle's got connections. Would you sell one to me? Oh, no, I couldn't do that. I mean, heck, you just helped me out of a real jam. I'll give you one for free. It's the least I can do. - Thanks a lot. - Oh, here. - That's funny. I thought I had 'em right there. - [tires screeching] - [car horn honking] - I don't even have 'em! Peter! Hey, Peter! I got your tickets to The Ed Sullivan Show! - My tickets! How'd you get them? - Never mind how I got 'em, but I got 'em! If you wanna get 'em back, you're gonna have to get your goddamn hair cut! I found a barbershop that's open, so let's go! You can't do that. It's extortion! I can do any goddamn thing I want to! I'm your father! And no kid of mine is gonna run around looking like a goddamn girl! Wait a minute, will ya! - Well, I'm not gonna cut my hair! - And I'm not gonna argue with you! If you want these tickets back, you're gonna get your hair cut! - Now, you think about it! - I don't have to think about it! For all I care, you can take those tickets and shove 'em! - [radio: "I Saw Her Standing There"] - What's your name anyway? - Ringo. Ringo Klaus. - What? Well, actually, it's Richard. Richard Klaus. This is my official Beatles talcum powder. Anyway, like Ringo Starr, you know, he changed his name from Ringo... from Richard to Ringo? Well, that's what I did. My real name's Richard, and I changed it over to Ringo. See? You know how the real Ringo has lots of rings? Well, I got my own ring too, see? Just like Ringo. Good. I know all that stuff. Listen, I know everything there is to know about the Beatles! There's nothing I don't know about the Beatles! I'm the greatest Beatles genius in the history of the universe. Ask me anything about the Beatles. Ask me how tall John is. And the answer come back... 5'11". Ask me when George's birthday is. And the answer come back... February 23, 1943. There's nothing I don't know about the Beatles. Ask me anything there is to know about the Beatles! [Murray the "K"] Who is the youngest Beatle? - Oh! - I know the answer! Give me the phone! - Get away! I know it too! - It's my room, and it's my phone! - Hand it over! - Get away! Let me! - [line ringing] - [gasps] It's ringing! - All right, who's the youngest Beatle? - Ringo! - George! - Aww! It's Ringo! Ringo, you crackpot! You... You stupid idiot! It's George! Ringo's the oldest! Ringo's 23, George is 20! Well, it's a trick question. George is the youngest in age, but Ringo was the last to join the Beatles, therefore he's the youngest Beatle. The question was, "Who is the youngest Beatle?" And that means it's Ringo. See? You're an idiot. You're a fink. You lousy rat fink! I could've won those tickets! Waaah! Aah! Aah! Ah, now I got you, you little shitheads! - Who you calling little? - [growls] [officer] Oh, my God! He's a maniac! - [radio: "I Saw Her Standing There" guitar solo] - Waah!

Hey, you wanna get in and see 'em? Fifty bucks. - You don't like it, get the hell outta here. - All right, all right, I'll find the 50. Then what do I do? All right, listen now. Here's what's happening. The Beatles are the last act. Right? All right, you wait till the show starts, you come to this door and knock like this. [two quick knocks, one knock, two quick knocks] I open the door, you give me the 50, you're in. Right now, get the hell outta here. I gotta eat. Fifty bucks? Where am I gonna get 50 bucks? Mmm. Mmm!

[women chattering, laughing] [whispering] [chuckles] Is this seat taken? Say, how's the food around here? You guys eat here often? Oh. Well, then I take it that you're not from around here, huh? - Brooklyn. - No kiddin'. Me, I'm from Jersey. [patrons chattering] Hey, hey! Way to go! Nice play, Shakespeare! - [giggling] - [Tony laughing] Say, you girls ever been on top of the Empire State Building? Well, I was thinking about going up there later on this afternoon. And, uh, maybe you'd like to join me? - [woman giggles] - Hey, what's the gag? She thinks you look like Paul. Oh, yeah. Lots of people tell me I look like Newman. Not Paul Newman. Paul McCartney! Paul McCart... Never heard of him. He's one of the Beatles! [coughing] Oh! [clears throat] - [coughs] - What's with you? You got something against the Beatles? Who, me? Besides the fact that their music stinks, that I hate their guts, and they're nothin' but a bunch of candy-ass pansies? No. Listen, greaseball, nobody asked you to sit here, so beat it. Now, wait a minute. Everything was going fine here. We were having a nice, leisurely lunch and over a little chat, and then you had to go and mention the Beatles and make me choke on my goddamn food! Let's get out of here. Hey, wait a minute! What about the Empire State Building? Why don't you jump off it? Hey, you know what I do to Beatles? I stomp on 'em! - Oh! - [woman] Oh! - [chattering] - [woman] Smooth move, Ex-Lax! [gasps] Oh! Oh, wow. [inhales] Oh, my God. [gasps, sighs] [screams] [gasps] [gasps] [moans] Oh, my God.

They know even half my stuff's worth $500. I'll sue 'em. That's what I'll do. I'll sue 'em. I just think we're lucky they didn't throw us in jail. They can't throw us in jail. We're both under 18 years old, therefore we're both minors, therefore they can't throw us in jail. And that's the law. And if there's one thing I know, it's the law.

Okay? - Grace, I don't have that much left. - What did you spend it on? - On these. - Well, what are these? - Beatles bedsheets. - Beatles bedsheets? Those are the actual bedsheets the Beatles slept on Friday night. Only two bucks per square inch. You paid two bucks for this little piece of nothing? - They're worth at least five! - What time do you think we'll be going home? Oh, yeah? How do you know these are the real Beatles' bedsheets? 'Cause the guy that sold 'em to me said they were authentic. And you can't lie about a thing like that. That would be against the law. We should be getting home. I don't wanna miss The Ed Sullivan Show. Hey, tell me somethin'. Were there a lot of kids buying these things? Oh, heck yeah. You want me to show you where the guy is that sold 'em to me?

My whole life is ruined! - [sobbing] - Don't worry. I'll get us out of this mess. Somebody from the hotel's bound to save us. They'll rescue us, just like the cavalry. - [sobbing, wailing] - Don't worry! - It's not like we're gonna suffocate. - [screaming] We got plenty of fresh air. Oh, before I forget, here's a little something for you on behalf of the boys and myself, just to show there are no hard feelings. It's a pass to the boys' performance on the telly tonight. Oh, my God! Thank you. Oh, by the way, there's some members of the press downstairs. They'd like to chat with you a bit. You don't have any objections, do you? Reporters? Well... Well, what do they want to talk to me for? They just want to ask you a few questions. - [man on TV] And of course... - [woman] You must be Al. Hi. I'm Cindy. - Hi, Cindy. I'm glad you could make it. - [door closes] - Can I, uh... Can I take your coat? - Yeah, sure. - Can I fix you a drink? - A Coke, please. [man on TV] ...struggle almost endlessly for their freedom. Well, uh, what kind of party did you have in mind, Al? Well, uh, actually, Cindy, it was more like a... a picnic. - [man on TV] Look at that! - [Cindy chuckles] She's probably gonna end up in one of those houses. She is gonna end up in one of those houses. And it's all your fault. [burps] [man] Hey, here she comes. How 'bout a big smile for the cameras, baby? - Look over here, sweetheart. There you go! - [reporters clamoring] How does it feel to be in the limelight? Would you do it again if you had the chance? [Pam] I don't know. I... Hold it right there. Thank you. [woman] What is it about these, uh... about the Beatles anyway? [man] Different generation, yeah. That's what I mean. [woman] Have you heard their music? Okay, could the people in the front please sit down for the benefit of those in the back? Thank you. Now I'd like to introduce you to the young lady I told you about, Miss Pam Mitchell. [man] Miss, how does it feel to be the number-one Beatle fan in New York? [reporters clamoring, shouting questions] [inaudible over shouting] [man] Did you talk to them all? What did you talk about? - [woman] Miss Mitchell. Miss Mitchell! - [man] Did you talk to them all? Millions of young girls across the country dream about what you've done today. Perhaps you'd like to tell them, how did you feel actually being in the Beatles' hotel room? W-Well, I, um... It's kind of hard to put into words, but... I guess it... it... it was... - It was wonderful. - [reporters chuckling] It was the most wonderful feeling I've ever had in my life. - [TV continues] - Al, would you mind if I switched to Ed Sullivan? - 'Cause the Beatles are gonna be on. - I don't care. Anything you want. - Mmm. Thanks. - [man] Try to land one of these. - [applause] - Thank you. Thank you very, very much. Uh, something really, really, really nice just happened and, you know, the Beatles got a real, real kick out of it because we received a wire... or they did... from Elvis Presley and Colonel Tom Parker wishing them the most tremendous success in our country. I think that was really, really, really nice. Now, you know, this particular season has seen many, many exciting acts, like the little Italian mouse, Topo Gigio, Belgium's singing nun, Sister Sourire... [chuckles] Well, kid, looks like your old man really stuck it to you this time. The Sullivan show's already started. You may as well go home. Oh, no, they'll let us in even if we're late, just as long as we got the tickets. Okay? I'll give you one of my genuine Beatles bedsheets. Here, you can have a Paul. I'm gonna miss The Ed Sullivan Show. No, no, there's no way we can miss The Ed Sullivan Show. I know where there's a TV. And besides, the Beatles are the last act. They always save the best act for last. That way you have to sit through all the commercials. I got tickets to see 'em in person! [sniffling, sobbing] I won 'em on the radio. Yeah, well, that's what I was saying... You... We're... No... W-We're trapped! Oh, please, get us out! Somebody save us! We're trapped like rats! [bystanders clamoring] - Back off. - All right, girls, get back there. - [woman] Hold it! - All right, hold it down. Pam! Pam, did you touch them? - Can I touch you where they touched you? - I didn't touch them. - Oh, can I have your autograph? - Sure. Can we have your autograph? [girls shouting] [girl] Can I touch... Were you in the room? [Neil] We'd better hurry if you wanna see the show. - Can I touch you? - [shouting continues] - Excuse me. - Bye. - Bye-bye. You take care. - Bye. - Who's that guy? - Oh, that's Neil. He's really nice. - You'd like him. - Yeah, let's go. - You had me worried. I hope you know that. - Oh, I'm sorry, but today was so incredibly... Look, I'm gonna let it go this time, but you are gonna have to start acting more responsibly. You're hurting me! Pam. - Where's my ring? - What? My ring. I paid a hundred and... [quieter] I paid $175 for that ring. Where is it? It's, um... I-It's in my shoe. - I put it in my shoe. - Well, get it the hell out of your shoe. I thought that would be the safest place for it when I was running around here. I couldn't think of anything else to do with it. Because I lost my purse on our way here. It was just in the car and... I'm sorry, I... [crying] Come on. Let's get outta here. Hey. Psst. There he is. [thunderclap, thunder rumbling] - Hey, watch where you're walking! - This is a free country. I can walk where I want. Then walk on the expressway. - Come on. Let's go. - Wait a minute. Got the tickets? Of course I got the tickets. Come on! Let me see 'em! [thunderclap] There ain't no tickets in here! Look! Now come on. Let's go. No. Dad! No. No. No. [grunting] - Dad, no! Put me down! - Now, sit in there! - [grunting] - I said sit in there! Oh, Jesus, no. I said stay in that chair! Do you want to see that show or don't you? Look at that. - You ever see a haircut like that before? Huh? - Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm. Isn't that somethin'? How would you like to have a kid like that? Mm-mmm. Got into town last night, saw him from the back, I thought it was my daughter. Hmm. I told him, "If you don't get a haircut, you'll have to wear a sign." [chuckles] - Isn't that somethin'? - Mm-hmm. All right then, go to work. All right, now just take it easy. Nobody's gonna hurt you. Now, be a man and everything'll be fine. [rapid breathing] Ah. All right, kid, how do you want it? I want him to look like a marine. - [switch clicks] - [buzzing] [door slams] [groaning] [groaning continues] Oh, my God! He's just been hit by a bus! [groaning continues] I... I think he's in shock! Mister, please, can I use your coat? We've gotta keep him covered! [groaning continues] He looks bad! You better give him some mouth-to-mouth resuscitation! [moans] Uh, right. Uh, could you call an ambulance, please? - There's a phone booth right outside. - Okay, okay. Give him some mouth-to-mouth, huh? Did you hear what I said? Mouth-to-mouth. [moaning] [blowing] More oxygen! [moans] [Peter] Come on. Oh, great. Come on! What the... [groans] - Hello? Hello? - [hook switch clicking] Aw, it's dead. It's completely dead. Just like everything else in this roach trap. I knew it. I knew this would happen. It's because I'm being punished. I'm being punished because I missed mass this morning. Hey, a trap door. Of course! A trap door! All elevators have to have trap doors. That's the law. With this, you can crawl up through the fifth floor. Oh, no, you'd better not. That looks awful dangerous. Dangerous? Why, this isn't dangerous. I'll tell you what's dangerous. The time I got thrown off the Long Island Railroad. Now, that was dangerous. This isn't even moving! Oh, that's what I was afraid of. A safety interlock. - We'll never get these doors open. - Oh, it's hopeless. The show's already started. We may as well forget about it. Forget about it? Forget about the Beatles? What's the matter? You screwy or somethin'? What else can we do? We've tried everything else. It's only two-eighths-inch plate glass. These doors are pretty flimsy, like everything else in this fleabag. So? Come on! What are you waiting for? Just think. In a couple of hours you're gonna be Mrs. Eddie Lupus. Mrs. Eddie Lupus. I like the way that sounds. [chuckles] Hey, it's gonna be a great life for us, Mrs. Lupus. And why shouldn't it be? I've got a great job. Heck, I'm in on the ground floor of something really big. These plastic furniture covers are the thing of the future. Yeah, we'll have to skimp the first few years and we won't be able to go out much. But, uh, who cares? [chuckles] We'll have each other. Mr. and Mrs. Eddie Lupus, till death us do part. I'd rather see the Beatles. - What? - Eddie, stop the car. - I wanna get out. - What are you talking about? I've got this ticket to see the Beatles and I don't want to miss it. W-We're getting married! I can't do it, Eddie. I can't marry you. What did you say? I just can't marry you. I don't want to anymore. Pam, what the hell have you been doing here in New York? I've just realized that there are more things in life for me besides marriage. - Like what? - Like the Beatles! - Pamela. Pamela! - [horns honking] You come back here! Did you hear me? Did you hear me? Come back here! - [woman] Your luxurious sweetheart bath. - [spanking] - [Al chuckles] More, more. Oh, yeah. - In pure, mild SweetHeart soap. Faster, faster, faster! [groaning, panting] [announcer] When it's least expected, you're the star. Don't miss Candid Camera tonight at 10:00, 9:00 Central, here on CBS. [whispering] Candid Camera. That's it! Come on, Larry. Come on. [burps] Hey, Tony, what are you really gonna do with that ticket? I told you. I'm gonna scalp 'em. Do you mind? You know, Rosie could really use that ticket, if you're just gonna sell it to some stranger. [Tony] Look, how am I supposed to find Rosie? You want Rosie to have a ticket, you go find her and give her yours. Oh, my God! That's her! She's here! - Rosie! Hey, Rosie! - Janis! Wait a minute! I won tickets on the ra... You won 'em too! [laughs] Come on! - [Sullivan] And right now, from Paris, France... - [Al] Good. Rub it. Faster. Faster! [laughs] ...here is Pierre Poullier and his performing poodles. - Let's bring him on with a nice welcome, shall we? - [audience applauding] [Al grunting, gasping] Yes! - Oh-oh-oh! Get a little on the back. - ["Sabre Dance" playing] - ["Sabre Dance" continues playing] - [chattering] Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Excuse me. - Hey! - Excuse me. - Pam! [screeching laugh] - Rosie! - What are you doing here? - I got an extra ticket! Hey, get these mongrels off the stage! We wanna see some real entertainment! - Shh! - I hate dogs. I always have. - [Al] Oh, that's good. Oh, good, good, good. - ["Sabre Dance" continues] That's good... Ooh! Faster. Faster. Faster! [giggles] Oh, that's good. Uh, get the ketchup. Get the ketchup. Put a little ketchup on the side. Ketchup. - Smile! You're on Candid Camera! - [both screaming] - [Al] Hey! - Watch the birdie! - Say "cheese"! - What the hell are you doing? Don't worry. I'll have these proofs sent to your house. You and your wife can select the prints you'd like at your own convenience. What are you doing to me? What do you want? However, if you prefer to have the negatives processed somewhere else, I'd be more than happy to sell them to you at the incredible discount rate of only $50. Fifty bucks? That's blackmail! - Look, Al, I happen to be in a hurry. - All right, okay. Okay. Fifty bucks. Smart move, Al. You're never gonna regret this. You know, I'm letting you off easy. Here's your film, Al. [yelling] - [screaming] - Hold it, you little bitch! - You're not going anywhere with my money! - Oh, no! No! No! [Larry shouts] Get your goddamn hands off her, you big hot dog. - [Cindy screams] - ["Sabre Dance" ends] [audience applauding, screaming] Oh, Larry, you were just wonderful! - Let's get the hell out of here. - Come on. Come on. Come on, hot dog. [Sullivan] Just... Just... Just stay tuned. - We'll be right back with the Beatles... - Down, Larry. Down, Larry. ...after this word about Aero Shave. Now, ladies and gentlemen here in the studio audience, right after these commercial announcements we're going to bring out... the Beatles! [screaming] [Sullivan] All right, now, just simmer down. Simmer down. Relax. Let's just try to take it easy. - [screaming] - Shit! Hey, this thing handles pretty well. Now, I wanna remind you, all you people, to keep your seats. Remain seated for the entire show. All of you, stay in your seats, especially you folks up there in the balcony. Now, you. Young man up there. Would you please sit down there, please? - Who, me? - Yes, you. Now, will you please take off that ridiculous hat? Okay, Ed! How are people behind gonna be able to see with that ridiculous hat on there? All right, Ed. [Sullivan] So please, let's have no more outbursts like that. - Let's set a nice example for... - Would you like me to take my coat off too? All right, take that off too. But sit down. - Please! - [Richard gasps] Jesus Christ! - [tires screeching] - [horn honking] Whoo-hoo! - [horns honking] - [Grace screaming] What do you think this is, a funeral or something? - Uh, Larry, it's a red light! - I don't see no red light. [horn honking] - We want the Beatles! We want the Beatles! - [Sullivan] Now, you promised. - We want the Beatles! - You promised! So far you've all been very well behaved. Now, let's not spoil it. I don't wanna have to bring a barber out here. - [audience chanting continues] - That's why I have a barber station just in case. We want the Beatles! We want the Beatles! We want the Beatles! - [chanting continues] - ♪ Brylcreem, a little dab'll do ya ♪ ♪ Brylcreem You'll look so debonair ♪ ♪ Brylcreem The gals'll all pursue ya ♪ ♪ They'll love to run their fingers Through your hair ♪ - [screaming] - [horn honking] - [Grace] Get me safe, please, all right? - A near miss! - Hold on! - [screaming] Serves you right, you moron! [announcer] Pain mounts up. You feel dull, depressed. [director] Would somebody out there get those title cards in focus? You can't read this shit. - [man] How do I know which one's Ringo? - [director] I think he plays the guitar. [man] What guitar? There's three guitars. [director] I've got a headache that's gonna slam through my ears. Where the hell is Ed? [tires screeching] - It's a one-way street. - I'm only goin' one way. [girls screaming within] [thunder rumbling] [exhales] [whistling] [screaming continues, faint] [gasps] [police radio chatter] You got the 50? - Yeah. - Come on. [thunderclap] [thunder rumbling] [thunderclap] All right, kid, you're going down a one-way street the wrong way. - Let me see your license. - [sighs] I haven't got a license. You don't have a license, huh? Then who belongs to this car? It's my father's. You're gonna have to go down to the station house. You can call your old man from there. - Out of the car. - [Grace] Excuse me. Excuse me, Officer. This kid here. This kid, he's... he's my boyfriend, and, um, I was just wondering if there was any other way we could take care of this. Well, driving without a license is a very serious offense. I know, Officer, but, um, do you... do you think his fine would be more than $50? Well, that sounds about right. [thunder rumbling] Well, um, Officer, my friend and I, we're both really in kind of a hurry, and I was wondering, if we were to pay you the fine right now... do you think you could take care of it for us? Well, it's, uh, an irregular procedure, but in this case I'll make an exception. Thank you. All right, kid, I'm gonna give you a break this time. Thank you, sir. But let this be a lesson to ya. Whew. Hey, thanks a lot, Grace. Forget it. [Sullivan] Now, all day yesterday and today the theater's been absolutely jammed... Oh, my God. - ...with newspapermen and photographers... - I'm gonna see Paul. - ...and they all agree there has never been... - I'm gonna see Paul right here. [director] Stand by. One minute. When they come out there, keep that audio down, mister. I don't wanna see that needle... [thunder rumbling] - Tony, Tony, don't do it! - [screams] Janis!

What if everybody starts running around, looking like that? Oh, please, Tony, please, just listen to me for a minute! Forget it, Janis!
