- Good morning. - Morning. You look exhausted. You sleep okay? - Yeah, I was just up a little late talking with some friends back home. - How's everybody doing? - Good. Just miss them, you know? Still haven't made any real friends around here yet. - Yet. Listen, I know it's hard. But if you put yourself out there, you're gonna make some new friends. Just takes a little effort. - I know. - What do you want for breakfast? - No, no, no, don't worry about it. I actually want to get to school a little early to study, so. - Good morning, ladies. - Morning. - Aren't you going to be late for your interview at the youth center? - Oh, they pushed it to 11. I don't know why I'm so nervous today. - Please. You got a ton of experience, they'd be lucky to have you. - He's right, Mom. - Well, can I use family members as references? - You are awesome. Just know that. - According to? - Well, me for one. - And on that note. - I'll see ya, bye, kiddo. - Bye. - Oh, look at this. You can't wear this. I need to take you shopping. - Oh, no, it's nothing, don't worry about it. - Brooke, we can afford it, it's okay. - Yeah. Forget. - Okay, so first thing in the morning, me and you? Shopping? - Okay. I love you, Mom. - I love you too. - I'll see you later. - Have a good day. - You too. - Bye. - I am so sorry. - You're in my history class. Brooke, right? - Yeah. - Corey. - Um, well, did you study for that quiz today? - Nope. But it's not gonna affect my D average though, so. - Wow. My mom would kill me for anything less than a B. - Oh yeah? - Wanna mom swap? - Yeah. - I was kidding. - I know. - Um. - Yep. - Okay, well, I'm off to take that quiz that I wish I didn't have to take. Okay. Anyway. I'll see you next period? - See you next period. - Okay. - See you round. - Soon, in history. - Yeah, right. - Dude. That new girl is way out of your league. You know she lives in Westmont, right? Family's like loaded. - Hey, Brooke. - Hey. - I just want to make sure you heard about the class ski trip. - Oh, cool. - It's like spring break in the winter. All-inclusive, minimal supervision. Everybody's gonna be there. - Okay. Maybe. - Hope you can come. - So? Hey, I'll take one of those. - Oh, please. - Later, dude. - The Promise and Hope Youth Center opened its doors last June with the purpose of providing local disadvantaged children with a clean and welcoming environment. - On average, how long do they stay here? - Oh, anywhere from six weeks to six months. The goal is to eventually place them in permanent housing. - Foster homes. - Yes. It's not easy, but it's better than longterm group housing. - I agree. I've always thought at-risk children do much better in family environments than institutions. - You worked at a youth detention facility, correct? - Before I moved here, yes. I learned a lot. Mostly what a challenge it can be to reach these kids. Especially at first. - How were you able to connect with them? - Initially, by giving them space. They're guarded, understandably so. But then it's just a lot of listening. Honestly, they just want to be heard. - I agree. Let me show you the learning center we have. So we've got enough computers for everyone who's living here. - Well, I'm impressed with what you guys are doing here. Thanks for the opportunity today. - Thank you so much for coming in today, Mrs. Moore. We'll be in touch. - Great. - Let me walk you out. - You hustling for a job? Trust me, you don't wanna work here. - Jade, please. - It's okay. Why not? - It looks nice but it's a dump. The food stinks and it's too damn noisy. - I get it. Wondering if you're gonna be moved someplace new, not knowing when or where. Makes it hard to attach. - Sure. - It's okay. - That's Jade. - This is Jacob, your loan officer, returning your call. I'm sorry, Mr. Gilbert, you've already got a double mortgage. There's no further equity to pull from a loan. I recommend you continue to try to sell the home if you need any money. - Where's my 18 grand? - I told you, I'm working on it. - Work faster, then you can get back to your precious game. You got 24 hours. - Whoa, no, no, no, no. You said I got three weeks. - Yeah? Well, I changed my mind. Get up here. - Maybe later. - Take a look at the board coming in. Ladies and gentlemen, class does start at the same time every day. Come on, ladies and gentlemen, take your time. Who wants to be 30 in high school? I'm tired as you are. Okay, everybody, notebooks away. Yes, that's right, ladies and gentlemen, your favorite time of year, it is quiz time. Has anyone seen Corey Gilbert? Figures. Okay, everybody, let's head out. Quiz will be rescheduled for first thing Monday morning. Come on, ladies and gentlemen. - Yes. Burner heaven. - Hey, what are you doing? - What are you doing? - Are you serious? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, you don't wanna do that. - I'm sorry, just take it. - Yeah, that's what I thought. Your phone. Your wallet too. - Yes, okay, okay. - Come on. Thank you, Robert. You tell anyone about this, you'll expect a little visit, okay? - Damn it. - Hey, man. Here they are. - See what you got. Not bad. Let's say 20 each for these. - No, actually, let's say I take it all. Your cash and these phones. - Okay, easy there. I'll give you the cash. - Yeah. - It's everything I've got. - Hey, Fiona. - Anyone sitting here? Sweet. So, what's up? - Hey. Hey, did you pull that alarm earlier? - I have no idea what you're talking about. I heard you're really good at history. The thing is, I suck. Can you help me? - What do you remember about Charles Lindbergh? - Oh, I think I started that chapter. He is the guy who flew really far, right? - Across the Atlantic. Anything else? Um, in 1932, his infant son was kidnapped for ransom. The whole country was on edge. Everyone wanted to see if the baby would come home. - Wow, that's messed up. What happened? - You're gonna have to read it to find out. - Or we could, you know, study together before the Monday quiz. - Okay. I'll give you my number. - All right. - My mom and I are going shopping tomorrow morning, so just text me later. - Shopping, of course. - What's that supposed to mean? - It's just that you live in Westmont. It's like what you guys do, right? - Look. That's my stepdad's money, not mine. And FYI, when I was a kid, we needed food stamps to buy groceries and we lived in a tiny one bedroom apartment. So. - Sorry, I overstepped. - A little. Maybe I'm a little hypersensitive about it. Just text me, okay? I mean it. - All right. Right. Sounds good. - Hey, do you wanna go see that movie tonight? - Maybe we could just stream something? Trying to save up for new tires for The Beast. - Okay, lipstick on a pig. - Man, you ride a skateboard, bro. - That's by choice. Come on, man, give me a break. - Later, Corey. - You know she's never actually gonna go out with you, right? - Something wrong with me? - Oh, I could make a list. Starting with the fact that you're always broke. - So? Money's not everything, dude. - Exactly. That's exactly what broke people say. - Oh, whatever. - Hey. - We still on for shopping tomorrow? - Of course. - Well, anything you want. It's coming out of my first paycheck. - You got the job? - Not yet, but I'm feeling really good about it. - Good. - So who are you texting? Old friends? - A new friend. - Huh, a boy? - Maybe. - Okay, fine. I'll have some details tomorrow while we shop. - Mom, it's nothing. - Good night. - Good night. - Hey, little brother. - Hey. Where you been? - What are you, my mother? - Hey, hey, that's mine. - Yeah, what's yours is mine and mine is yours, right? How much you got in here, anyway? - I don't know, like 1,400 bucks. That I'm saving for... - For an emergency? Exactly, which is precisely why I'm taking it, okay? - Hunter! Hunter! - Hey. You ready? - Not until I'm caffeinated. - Ah. - Oh, girls' day out, that's right. - Yes. Are you sure you don't want to go with us? - No, no, golfing today. You have fun without me. - Oh, we will. - Bye bye. - Bye. - Okay, you ready? - Ready Freddy. - Okay, I'm finished. - Let's do this. - I'm telling you, man, she likes me. - She says she's gonna study with you, not go to the prom. - Why are you so negative? - Just being straight up. That's what friends do. Oh, great. Hunter's home. - Come on, help me. - What are you losers doing? - Uh, homework. - What are you doing homework for? You ain't going to college. - What are those? - Cell phones. Burners, untraceable. You want one? - Uh, I'm good. Yeah, yeah. Hey, I gotta run. My parents are gone but I gotta do... - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - I'll give you a ride. - No, wait a second, wait a second. Who's this? - Just someone from school. - You know this girl? - A little. - What's her name? - Brooke. Brooke Williams. - What do her parents do? They must be loaded, right? - No, I mean, her stepdad's loaded but I guess I don't really know what he does. - She lives in Westmont. She's crazy rich, off the charts. - Westmont, huh? Come on. - Wait, where are we going? - Eric's going home, right? I'm just going along for the ride. Come on. Hey, turn right at the light up here. - But I live straight ahead. - Yeah, nah, I forgot to mention, I gotta make a quick stop first. - I know you could've shopped all day but I'm happy to be home early. Yeah. - I love it. It looks so good on you. - It was expensive. - Brooke! You have to stop worrying. - Yeah. - Andrew is financially secure. - Yeah. - And you know I would never take advantage. - Okay, fine, I'll stop. - Okay. You never actually talked to me about the boy that you were texting with. Is he hot hot hot? What? - Oh yeah. I think we're gonna study later. - Oh, really? That's good. You know, I think this one is really more you perhaps than me. What do you think? - Yeah, it's 80s. - It's cute. You can have it. - It's cute, thank you. Well, anyway, me and that guy, we're just friends. Sort of. - Oh, okay. So you are at least making friends at school. - It's one conversation, one friend. Don't get too excited. Wait, before I forget. - What? - I do, I think I wanna go on this. - Class ski trip. I don't know. Is there gonna be any chaperones there? - What? Why? - Well, a bunch of teenagers at a ski lodge? Things could get pretty wild. - I can't go asking how many chaperones there are gonna be and if anyone's gonna sneak in any booze. I just need to say yes or no. - Then I feel you should say no. I'm not comfortable with it. - Not everyone is like those juvenile delinquents you work with. - They're not delinquents, Brooke. They just haven't been as fortunate as you have. - Okay, look, Mom, I had to leave all of my friends back home and now you won't let me go on this stupid ski trip where I could quite possibly make a friend or maybe even two friends, who knows? - Okay, I will think about this. Sorry, honey, I gotta take this. This is Shannon. Oh, I see. I, yeah, I could make that happen. I just need an hour. That was the Youth Center. They want me to come and do a session with a kid. - But they haven't even hired you yet. - I know. Honey, you know how much I want this job. So we'll get back to this, okay? - What's the point? Apparently you still think I'm five. - Brooke, that's not true at all. Just let me think about this. Okay? - Thank you for coming on such short notice. She missed curfew again last night. She's been spending all her free time at this shady tattoo parlor. And to top it off, Jade skipped school yesterday for the fourth time in two weeks. - That's not a good sign, but you already have counselors here. - You nailed your interview yesterday, Shannon. You blew me away actually. Consider this a field training exercise. - Excuse me, um, it's actually my daughter. Sorry. - If anyone can reach her, you can. Good luck. - Okay. - I don't think this is a good idea. - What? I just wanna see where Corey's new girlfriend lives. - She's not my girlfriend. And she's not home, she's shopping with her mom. - Wow. Look at that. All right, all right, park right here, park right here. All right, let me know if anybody comes up to the house, okay? - Wait, why? - Because I said so. I'll be back in 15. - What is going on? - I have no idea, dude. Just chill. - I bet he's gonna steal stuff. I can't believe you're letting him do this. You're... - I don't care about school, period. I feel more at home with my tattoo crew. They're like the only family I have. - Tattoo crew, what do you mean tattoo crew? - They let me draw art for them. It's like a family, a home. Unlike this place. - So you don't like it here. Probably makes sense why you don't mind cutting school. No education, no job, no money. You care about money? - There's other ways to make money. - And most of those ways lead to jail. Jade, you're smart. You can finish school, get an education, and build a real life for yourself. - I'm not smart. - You've taken care of yourself all these years, haven't you? - So? - Street smarts, instincts, intuition. That's intelligence. Look, I'm here now. I accept you. You can have more than a tattoo crew. You can have a real family, a real home. We can find that for you together. - Mom? - Where is he? - He said sit tight. - We should just leave. - I can't just leave him here. - Actually, you can. Come on. - He's gonna kick my ass, dude. - Nice. - Mom? - Oh. You must be Brooke. - What are you doing in my house? - What are you doing home? You're supposed to be shopping. - Hey, Brooke, why don't you just open the door, huh? Hey, Brooke, come on. - Pick up, pick up. - Why don't you just unlock the door? - How do you know my name? - Unlock the door, open the door, and I can explain everything. How does that sound? - All I wanted was a ride home. - All right, well, we're giving you a ride home. - I live two blocks away from you. - Then walk! - All right, now I'm getting angry, Brooke. I'm gonna count to three. One. Two. Three. No, no, no, no, no, no. You shouldn't have done that. - Get off me! Get off me! - Hello? Brooke? - Somebody help! - Brooke? - Sorry, no calls. - No, please, help. Please, don't... - You make another sound again, I'll make sure you never make another peep, okay? Now let's go. - Honey, it looks like I just missed you. Um, call me back if it's important, okay? - Come on, man. - Just do it! - Go, little brother, right now. - What the hell are you doing? - Corey? - Let's go, let's go. - Please don't kill me. - Where'd you get that? - I told you we should've split. - Please just let me out! - Stop it, I can't think right now. Okay, just stop it, shut up. - Okay, Brooke, trying you again. Still haven't heard from you, honey, call me back. - Where are you taking me? Hunter, what are you doing? - Just go, just drive. - Whatever you guys are up to, just leave me out of it. - You're already a part of it, all right, just shut up and sit tight. - Corey, please tell me what's going on. Is that my mom? I wanna talk to her. - Not yet. - Please just let me... - Just shut up so I can hear myself think. - Brooke! Brooke. I'm home! Huh. - Hunter, maybe we should think about this, man. This is bad. - Turn right here. We're going to Eric's place, it's closer. - What? No, no, no, no. - Okay, maybe if we drop her off, it'll be fine. - She's right. She's right, okay, we need to talk to her mom. We're gonna do this right. We'll go to Eric's place, he's a little closer. - Look, look, my parents... - Won't be back until later tonight, right? It's perfect. - Brooke, are you up here? Brooke, honey, are you here? - What are you doing? - What are you doing? No, no! - Where is she? Brooke. Brooke! Honey? What? Oh my god. - Hi, honey. - Andrew, I think something's happened to Brooke. - What do you mean, what's happened? - I think somebody may have broken into the house or something. It looks like Brooke's bathroom has been ransacked. - She's not picking up her phone? - No, she's not answering my texts either. - Okay, honey, let me wrap up here and I'll come home. - Andrew, I'm scared. I mean, what has happened to her? - Let's not panic yet. You know what, all of our phones are on my account. We should be able to track it by logging onto the carrier website. - Oh my god, you're right. Okay. I'll call you back. There it is. Okay. - Did you find her? - Not yet, but I tracked her phone. I'm gonna head there right now. - Shannon, you need to call the police. - I'm 10 minutes from her. I'll find her before they will. - Shannon, hold on, I'm leaving now. - I'm gonna call you as soon as I find her. - Shannon. - What now? - Hey, you got any rope? - Wait, what for? - What do you think for, genius? It's for her. - I don't think so. - Duct tape then, huh? Something to tie her up with. Do I need to spell it out for you? - Please just let me go. I promise I won't tell anyone about you guys. I'll say you wore masks and I didn't even know who you were. - No, no, no, no. We let you go now, we get nothing but five to 10 in the state pen. No, I want something for this. - What do you want? - How much do you think she's worth? - Meaning what now? - No clue? No clue, either of you? I'm sure her parents have a pretty good idea. - This is a terrible plan, man. - You got a better one? - Corey. - Let's go. - I'm coming, baby, I'm coming, I promise. I'm almost to you. - That's better. - Please, if you, look, if you just take me home right now, I promise, my mom and my stepdad, they will give me whatever you want. - Or we could just call them on this. Actual kidnappers do. - Promise... - I'm not an idiot. All right, I need to make a call. I'll be right back. - Corey, please. Please, you can just let me go. Please, please. Please, I promise I won't tell anyone. I won't tell anyone if you just let me go right now, please! - I didn't know this was gonna happen. - What are you doing? Are you crazy? Corey, please just untape me and please just let me go. Please, Corey, please, please, please. I just wanna go home, I just wanna go home, I just wanna go home, you guys! - Hey, Verne. Hey, what's up? I'm a little tied up right now. I'm always hustling, trying to get your money. What do you need? - I heard they found Barkley dead yesterday. In an alley, like day old trash. - Yeah, you gonna miss him? - Not really. Just wanna make sure I'm gonna get my money. Or you and him are gonna have something in common. - Yeah, don't worry, you'll get it. - What, you gonna rob a bank? - Better. Trust me. - Corey, I thought you were my friend. - I was. I am. - Well, this is not very friendly. - I know, I... Brooke, Hunter did that... - Oh man, I can't, I can't, I can't. - Hey, what are you doing? - Look, cutting her loose, man. - No, we can't do that. - We can't do this! I'm sorry, but we're holding a girl for ransom. Your brother has lost it. And look, even if she goes to the cops, we gotta tell them the truth about your brother. - Yeah, but we were the ones who led him to her. And dude. And dude, he's my brother. - You don't owe him anything, okay? - Dude, just give me a second to think! - Hey, it's Brooke. Leave me a message, bye. - Damn it. - Can I help you? Excuse me. - I'm looking for my daughter. - In the bushes? Who's your daughter? What are you doing to my flowers? - Hey, it's Brooke. Leave me a message, bye. - Excuse me. What are you doing to my flowers? I'm calling the police. - No. No. - What? - I was just thinking that maybe we should let her go. - Were you? - No, no, no. You wanted me to cooperate, that's all I'm doing. Please don't. No, no, no, I swear I wasn't doing anything. I wasn't doing anything. I will give you whatever you're looking for. - That's better. Little peace and quiet, huh? All right. It's almost showtime. I'm gonna need you to play your part. Remember, make sure they can't see my face. - I should record this. Yes, okay, record. Pick up, pick up. - Hi, mom. Welcome to the party. - I'm right here. I am gonna get you out, I promise. Oh, my baby. Please don't hurt her. - I see you got my message. - I will give you anything. - Good. I want $250,000 by midnight. - $250,000? - That's what I said. - I mean, that's just, it's a lot of money. I think I need more time... - $250,000 and not a minute late. Or I send Brooke home one piece at a time. - Stop! No! No. - If we don't get our money, I'm gonna cut off a lot more than that, you hear me? - I will get it. I will get the money, I promise. - If you contact the cops, the deal's off. In case that crossed your mind. - Damn it! - Hi, mom. Welcome to the party. - Oh, my baby. Oh man. - Hey, babe. - Andrew, I just talked to the kidnappers and they've got Brooke. They've got her. - Okay, hon. I'm stuck in traffic but I'm on my way. I'll get there as fast as I can. - That was well-played. - You're a sick son of a bitch, you know that? - I've been called worse. - Do we really need to do this? - Oh, did you not just hear what she called your brother? And where the hell are you going? - I was just going to get a broom. - A broom? - My parents will ask questions if they see this. - You know, wait a second. Go with him. I said go. - What are you doing? - Dude, we gotta call the cops. - I'm not doing that. It's my brother, Eric. - He's also a deranged maniac... - Look, he's not a murderer. We'll get the money. It'll be like the Lindbergh baby. - You still haven't read the chapter, have you? The baby died. - Shannon? Shannon! Babe. - Andrew. Why, why? Why? - Baby, we need to call the police. - No. No, they will hurt her. I will not risk that. - What about the phone number they gave you? - I already looked it up online. It's a disposable, there's no owner information. - Okay, so what, we just give 'em the money? - Andrew, we have to. They will kill her. Don't you get this? - I get that. That's not what I meant, babe, it's just... - Liquidate your accounts. Call in favors, do whatever you have to do. I am gonna try to figure out who these kidnappers are. - How? - If they took her from here, then maybe someone saw them. - Yeah, okay. Okay. - You tell your parents about this and I'll kill you. And them, okay? - I swear. - And how do I know I can trust you? - He wouldn't do that to me. - To us. You sure? - Yeah, he's not gonna tell anyone. - Dude nearly peed himself. And don't you get any ideas, okay? You're coming with us. - Corey. Fine. Where are we going? - Our place. So no one hears you scream if mommy fails. Come on. - Excuse me, how long have you been out here? Because I'm just, I'm looking for my daughter. Oh, hey, I'm sorry to bother you. My family and I live up the street. I'm wondering if you may have seen anything today. - Sorry, didn't. - Maybe a car that didn't belong or? - I gotta go. - Thanks. - Hold on, stop. - What? - Eric forgot his skateboard. - Okay, I'll go give it back to him. - No, no, no, no, it's okay, I got it. Hang tight. She gives you any trouble, you shoot her. - I'm not gonna do anything. - I believe her, I don't need a... - I said take it. - Corey? Just let me go. This isn't you. - Ever since my mom left us, he's taken care of me. - I understand. - I wouldn't have made it without him. He's all I got. I won't turn my back on him. - He's manipulating you, Corey. He doesn't want what's best for you. - That's enough! - We're getting there. Only 50,000 to go. - Thank you, Andrew. - Of course. - I mean, how is it that no one has seen anything? - Shannon, don't torture yourself. - I keep thinking about all those years that Brooke and I were on our own. All I wanted was to give her a better life. I thought that when we moved here, I really had. - You have. She's doing great. - Really? Wait. Andrew, I see something. - What? - It looks like some kind of snake or a serpent. - Okay, if we can identify that tattoo. - Then we could find her kidnapper. - Who are you calling, Eric? - What are you doing here? - No, no, no, I asked you first. Who are you calling? - It's just my parents, you know? I'm just trying to find out when they'd be home. Come on, no. - Corey doesn't know you as well as he thinks he does, does he? - I wasn't gonna! - Your parents are gone for the day. They leave you here by yourself. You try to clean the place up a little bit and have a freak accident. - No, no, please. - You just couldn't leave it alone, could you? - No, no! - Do you know how many tattoo places there are in the city? This could take hours. - Yeah, we could split 'em up. - What are the chances of these people talking to us anyway? - So maybe it is time that we go to the cops, get some extra help. - Oh, come on, you know what the kidnapper said about doing that. - I know, but... - No, you're right. We do need help. You know what, I think I know who can help us. - What's taking him so long? - That's a good question, Corey. - What's that supposed to mean? - How long does it take to hand someone a skateboard? - What's going on? - It's fine, I got it under control. - Of course you do. - Where to now? - Home. - Oh, hey. Can I talk to you? - Sure. - I need your help. - Yeah, Mr. Jacobi said you'd be coming. - Did Mr. Jacobi tell you what's going on? - He said you would explain. - This is my daughter. Her name is Brooke. She's been kidnapped and I'm trying to find her. - For real? - Yes, for real. - Then why the hell didn't you call the cops? - Because they said they'd kill her if I did. So it's just me and my husband. - What do you need me for? - So I'm looking for someone with this tattoo. I know whoever this is is probably part of your tattoo crew family. But I need to find my daughter and whoever this is has her. Do you recognize this tattoo? - Not really. Sorry, there are thousands of tattoos out there. - Jade, look, I know you want to protect your tattoo crew, but whoever has this tattoo took my daughter and she's in real trouble. Are you sure you don't recognize this? - No, I never seen it. That it? - Do you know where they might have gotten it? Jade, I know you must know something that can help me. Come on. Wouldn't you do everything you could to find your mother if the tables were turned? - Oh, no, don't even! - You know, I just wanted you to trust me. Right now, I feel how you felt when you lost your mother. - My mother? I knew her well enough to know I'm lucky she's not around. I don't need her anyway. - Right. But I am going to be here and I need you. - You're gonna be here for me? - Yes. - Fine, let's say I help you. You find your girl and you go back to your perfect house and your perfect husband and your perfect life. What do I get? - I never said life was perfect, Jade. It isn't. - You're just saying this because you want me to help you. - No. Regardless of what you think of yourself right now, I care about you. And maybe we can help each other out if you let me. So if you know something, anything, please, tell me before it's too late. Will you help me? - Just sit tight, we're almost there. What, you got a hot date? Huh? - No, I was just wondering about Eric. But there's no signal out here. - Yeah, well, you know how it cuts in and out out here. - Where are we anyway? I've never been out here. - We're just west of town really. Take Route... - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Mr. GPS, shut up, okay? She doesn't need to know where we're going. - Okay, fine. - Stay here. If she tries anything, don't hesitate to shoot. You understand? - I understand. - Good. I'm gonna grab some rope from the shed. - Please help me. - When Hunter gets his money, we'll let you go. - Corey, please. - It'll be all right. Just take my word for it. - It's not you I'm worried about. - Stop! - You won't shoot me. - Get back in the car. - No, I am getting out of here before your brother comes back! - No, you're not. - I have to. Let me go! - Why'd you do that? You know, I thought we could be friends. - Yeah, maybe I did too. - What do you want? - What do I want? I want to live in the same place for more than a year. I want a mom like you who'd do anything for her kid. I want a normal life. - I know. I know you do, Jade. I get it. But if you're willing to trust me, I will do whatever it takes to find that for you. - There's this girl named Skylar. She's a couple years older than me. We used to party together. She's into tattoos and stuff. - Can I talk to her, please? - She's works at Rabble Rouser. It's a tattoo parlor downtown? She's working tonight. - Thank you, Jade. - Your kid's damn lucky. I hope she knows it. - I'll be back, I promise. I promise. - What was all that about? Did I not tell you to shoot her if she tried anything? - I got it handled. - Without her, we've got nothing, okay? Do you understand me? Corey, I need to hear that you understand me. Now come here. Come here! Okay. Listen, little brother. We cannot afford mistakes here, okay? I'm doing this for both of us. Corey, can't you see that? This money is going to change everything. - You're sure? - Yes, definitely. I mean, we could finally get out of this debt. You know, get some new cars. You know, you could even go to college or whatever. But I need you to hang in there and do what needs to be done, okay? Okay? - Yeah, okay. - Right now, let's bring her inside. We can put her in the spare room. What the hell is she doing now? - Hey, what! - Think your mommy's gonna save you? Huh, do you? - Get away from me, you disgust me! - Everyone just calm down. - Until I get that money, you're all mine and I'll do whatever I want to you. You think this is some kind of game we're playing? Huh? Think again, princess. - Hunter, stop! - I know you, I know what you're like. - Stop, Hunter! - You think you're better than us because you have lots of money, is that it? - Stop! - You have your big houses and your fancy cars, you think you're something special? - Hunter! - You people disgust me, you know that? - You're gonna kill her, man, get off! - I'm telling you right now. - You're gonna be okay, all right? Listen to me. We gotta go inside. Come on, you'll be okay. All right, just come, come out. - Hi, can I help you? - Are you Skylar? - Who's asking? - A friend of Jade's. - How's she doing? - She's okay. Getting better. I'm trying to identify a tattoo and she thought you might be able to help me. Um, do you mind taking a look? Here. - You can't really tell much about it. Snakes are pretty popular, you know? It's definitely not my work, can tell by the way it's shaded. - Do you have any idea whose work it might be? - Truth is, it looks a little rough. Makes me think it might be Verne's. - Who's Verne? - Max Verner. He hasn't got a license or anything, just does it for fun. He's a loan shark who runs an underground poker game. - Any idea where I can find Verne? - Maybe. - Please, open up? Are you Max Verner? - What, are you selling Girl Scout cookies or something? - I'm trying to find my daughter. She was kidnapped today and maybe you know something about the guy who took her. - Okay. - I just need you to look at this photo. Do you recognize this? - What's going on? - Come on, let's talk somewhere a little more private, huh? - Maybe we should just head back. - We could, but then we'd miss out on seeing the most beautiful waterfall in the country. - What if we get injured, Mom? Have you thought about that? - Mother's intuition. We're gonna walk out of here together. We've made it this far, haven't we? This is not the end of the road for us, trust me. Come on, let's do this. - Okay. - Hey, you awake? - Where's your brother? - He's in the bathroom. Should be back any minute. Hey, I'm sorry for what happened out there. Just do what he says, okay? Don't piss him off. - Really think that's gonna save me? - Look who's finally awake. - Yeah, where are you taking us? - I like to keep my girlfriend out of my business. - But I'm just showing up at your house... - Let me see it again? Who the hell sent you? - No one. I swear! - I don't wanna have to hurt you, you seem like a really nice lady and everything, but I get the feeling you're lying to me. - I'm not, I swear to you. - Is all that stuff about your daughter true? - Yes. Please. You might be able to help me. - I'm a businessman. What's it worth to you? - What do you mean, what do you mean? - How much is it worth to you? - Anything. Whatever you want. - I like the sound of that. Let's finish this upstairs. Let's go. Bitch! Damn it! Get back here! - We should let her rest. - You don't give the orders around here, little brother. I do. Let's go. Move. Not bad. That should hold it for now. Let's go. - Corey. - What's going on? Wait. I might know something about the guy you're looking for. The one who took your daughter. - Get in, now! - What? - Get in now! Okay, I'll explain, go. - Okay. - You really think we'll get the money? - We better. What are you doing? - She must be hungry by now. - Oh yeah, and what did you make for me? Thanks. Delicious. - Well? - There's a guy who comes around. He has the kind of tattoo you talked about. - Who is he? - I've said too much already. - No, please. - He's gonna be so mad at me. - Tell me, please. You know something that can help me. Why else offer information? - What are you doing? - Hold on. I'm just pulling over. - Look, Verne's gonna hate me ratting out his guys but if your daughter's with who I think it is. Wait, no, I can't. What am I doing? What is this? - Take it. Take all of it. This guy with the tattoo, if you're this scared of him, how do you imagine my daughter feels? She's all alone. Talk to me, please. - His name is Hunter. - Hunter. Hunter. Hunter what? - I don't know his last name. - Where can I find him? - He used to go to my high school. - What high school? - Rosedale. - Rosedale? That's my daughter's high school. - I think he used to live out in the woods. - Is there anything else? I'm begging you. - I'm sorry, I don't know anything else. - What are you going to do now? - The usual. Tell Verne I went to go buy a pack of cigarettes and I got lost on my way home. - You don't have to go back, you know. - Yeah, I do. My life's not a fairytale, lady. Verne may be a jerk but he keeps a roof over my head. - Okay. - What's up, Gina? Where have you been? - I told you I was out buying cigarettes. - Cigarettes? I suppose you got one for me then, right? The hell is this? - Nothing. - This isn't part of your allowance. Who gave this to you, huh? Am I talking to myself? Who gave it to you? - The lady that was here. - What did you tell her? What did you tell her? - Hey. Got this for you. - Thanks, but I'm not hungry. Is that your mom? - Yeah. - You must really miss her. - Hard to really miss someone when they're home every third night. Even when she was, she'd reek like booze or worse. But... Hunter took care of me. - Is that why you're so loyal to him? - You have no idea. You have a mom. You have a really nice house, you have everything. You don't understand people like us. - We struggled for years. But we were happy. - Yeah, that sounds like some fairytale. - It wasn't always perfect. But me and my mom, we had each other. We have each other. But the difference is, my mom always puts me first, before herself, and I don't think Hunter does that for you, Corey. He really doesn't. - I'll leave this here in case you change your mind. - So at least we have a name. Hunter. And he used to go to Brooke's high school. - That's great news. - I don't know where to find him. At least not yet. - Okay, Shannon, let's take this to the police now. With the name and the tattoo, I'm sure they can help us. - But these kidnappers are serious about hurting Brooke. - Sweetheart, that may just be a risk we have to take. - No, I can't do that! - But Shannon. - Andrew, I've gotta call you back. "To reserve a spot, for more information, call Fiona." Call 323-555-0169. - Man. - Hey, can I borrow your phone to call Eric, since you broke mine? - Yeah, knock yourself out. He said something about going to a movie or whatever. - You ever think what it would be like if Mom was still around? - The way I see it, things'd be a lot worse. Why? - No reason, I guess. - Like I said, something's happened to Brooke and I'm trying to find her. Do you know somebody by the name of Hunter? - There's a girl named Hunter, she's a freshman. - No, no, it's a boy. Look at this tattoo, have you seen it before? - No, don't think so. Oh, wait. Brooke had lunch with this kid Corey yesterday. Corey Gilbert? He's kinda shady, dangerous even. Maybe he... - Well, where would I find Corey? - Oh gosh, I don't know where he lives. I'm sorry. But wait, maybe this will help. Here, I've got a picture of him on my phone. - Wait, wait, wait. Look. That tattoo. That's Hunter. Can you tell me anything else? - He hangs out with this kid Eric. He lives a couple blocks away. You find Eric, you find Corey. - How do I get there? - Come on, Eric, come on. Where are you? - Hey, it's Eric. Leave it on the beep. - Hello? Anyone home? Damn. Eric? - Guess you'll be going home soon. I barely even got to know you. Not hungry? - Eric! - I apologize our accommodations aren't up to your standards. Little Miss Perfect. Fancy life. Yeah. I'll give you back to your mom. But until then, I own you. - Hello? - What the hell are you up to, Hunter? - This is Corey, Hunter's brother. - Yeah, well, your brother's got himself in a real mess with that girl. - How'd you know about that? - How do you think? - Oh my god. - Where you gonna go, huh? - Get off of me! - Just tell Hunter she was just here. - Who? - The girl's mom. And if she found me, chances are she can find you too. - Hi. - It's me. I think I found one of the guys who may have taken Brooke, but he's dead, Andrew. He's dead. - I can't believe this. - What about Brooke? Maybe she's already, I don't know. - Shannon, I'm calling the police right now. - No. Do not call the police, Andrew, she is my daughter. - Get off of me! Corey, please! Let go of me! Corey! Please! - My baby brother's not gonna protect you now. It's just me and you. You gonna play hard to get? - Get off of me! - I like that. - Get off of me! - What the hell are you doing? - You ever hear of knocking? - Hold on, hold on. Corey. I've got it, I've got it. I know how to find the other two guys. It's at 706 North Ridge Road. - North Ridge Road? That's way out in the valley. - Exactly. - No, Shannon, listen, I've almost got all the money together. Let's just stick with the plan we have. - I don't trust these guys. They may still hurt Brooke. I gotta go! - We got a problem. - What are you talking about? - Your friend Verne called. Brooke's mom came by his house. - What? Why would she go there? Why didn't she just get the damn money? What is she doing? - I thought you were more careful. - Not careful enough. Your mom's gonna get you killed! - Hunter, leave her alone. It's not her fault, none of this is her fault. - You did this, didn't you? - Hunter, stop! - No, I didn't, I swear. - Maybe I should just end this all right now. - Hunter, don't do anything stupid. - One little squeeze, that's all it'll take. - Look, look, look. Maybe there's another way. Taking Brooke hostage isn't working. It's just gonna land us in jail. I mean, how did you expect this was gonna end? She could be on her way right now with the police. - She's not gonna come with the police. I told her not to do that. - Okay, but she's probably bringing them anyway. - No, no, no, I told her not to do that, I told her not to do that! Brooke, you're dead. I told her I'd kill you if she called them. We have to get rid of her. - Yeah, it's my stepdaughter. She's been, uh, she's been kidnapped and my wife has gone after her. I'm concerned about both of them and I think I know where they are. - Looking for someone, huh? - The police are on their way, you know. - Oh yeah? Does the SWAT team usually send soccer moms with tire irons? - Where's Brooke? - You want to live to find out, let go right now. Let's go make this little family reunion, shall we? - Let go. - After you. Look who I found. - Mom? - Brooke! - Mom. - Honey. - We need to talk, now. Okay. Okay, I'm gonna take the mom back to their place to get the cash. If there's any cash to get, I'm having my doubts. Problem? - What if the cops are there waiting for you? - No, she wouldn't do that. Look at her. - You okay, you sure? God, I was so worried about you. Okay, okay, listen. We have to find a way to get you outta here. - No, not get me out of here. Get us out of here. I'm not going anywhere without you. - Okay, okay, okay. Get us outta here. Okay, we'll find a way, okay? I got you. - Okay, let's do this. You go grab the rope from the shed and tie her up again. I don't trust her anymore. Now let's talk about my money since that's the only reason you two are still alive right now. - My husband's getting it for you. - I wish I could believe you but you've already lied to me once and you tried to kill me with a tire iron, so that pretty much makes our deal null and void. You, on the ground, hands behind your head. - Wha-Shut up. doing? On your knees, hands behind your head. Mommy, you can go to that corner. Facing the wall, please. - Mom, what are you doing? Let's go! - Brooke, just go. Go now! Go! Go, go! Brooke, no. Okay, listen. Okay. Corey, listen. Just let us go, please. I know that you're not a killer like your brother. - He's never killed anyone. And none of this would've happened if you just did what he told you to do. - Listen to me. He killed Eric, don't you know that? - What are you talking about? - I'm sorry, Corey. Come on, this is your last chance to do the right thing. - Yeah, sure is. - If you hurt her! - What are you gonna do, slap me real hard? - Hey! Did you kill Eric? - What? - Tell me the truth. - No, no, what, did they tell you that? Come on, Corey. I've always done what's best for us, right? I always have, haven't I? - Don't listen to him, Corey, he's lying to you. - Stay out of it. - Did you kill my best friend? Why? What did you do? - He was gonna rat us out, Cor. All right, I wasn't gonna let that happen. We'd be in a prison cell right now. Think about it, okay? You just had to go ahead and do that, didn't you? Huh? - No, I'm not going with you! - Stay down! Don't move. - College. You know, before I met your mom, I never even thought about it. - Hello, hello. How's the studying going? - I got a migraine from algebra overload. - Oh my god, did you guys leave anything for other customers? - It's for our ski trip. Jackets, sweaters, gloves. - And don't forget the waterproof socks. - I'm telling you, we'll need 'em. Jade, you sure you don't want to join us? There's plenty of room at the cabin. - Thanks again, but I'm a warm weather kind of girl. - Jade, I have some news. - What? - Your foster parents, they applied for adoption. - What? What? Oh my god! Thank you. Thank you for keeping your promise. - It's nothing. - Oh my god! Congratulations. - Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow, right? - Yeah. - Same time. - Yeah. - What? - Oh my god. Like a superhero, Mom. - You think? - Please, you guys. - No, seriously, you're like saving lives left and right. You're awesome. I mean it. - So are you, kid. I mean, it's genetics, right? - Right. - Clearly. Come on, you wanna see what's in those bags? - Sure. - Lots of good stuff. - Oh. - Waterproof socks are in here. - Oh, cool. - If you wanted to check those out first. - Oh god, I don't know if we're gonna need that. Those will make your feet sweat. I read up on it and they said... - Oh, you did, did you? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, they say...
