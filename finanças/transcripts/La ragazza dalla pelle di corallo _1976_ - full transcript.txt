Thanks. I love you. I love you! 'The Woman With Coral Skin' We'll reach the border soon. My plantation has produced around 1000 tonnes this year. But we're working up to 2000, and in a few years we'll reach 2500 We're also working on a deal with Italy where our tobacco will sell well. Until now we've been limited to cultural exchanges. Like in this case, unfortunately. - A phone call, the ministry. - I need to speak to them too. Excuse me for a moment. Please, continue the tour. - What do you think of this place? - I don't see anything new. Except for the tobacco selection. Well I've had enough. We haven't stopped for four days. - And the look on your face. - You think so? Listen, the old man is taking us out tonight. Have you seen the women around here? I'm telling you, they're not like our women, they're more feminine. Perhaps they're just a bit more altruistic. - Why? Aren't women all the same? - You think so? Perhaps you're forgetting about that pain in the ass? Take my wife... Our women, I mean. You want me to say you're right? Okay, you're right. Hello? She's not answering? Tell them to insist. Yes, it's a Rome number, 67 45 22 Mrs. Biagini. Maria. It's you! I didn't hear you. I prepared some veal but it's a bit cold now. No, it's fine, thanks. I paid for the dry cleaning and left the change on your desk. - If there's nothing else? - No, thank you, goodnight. Your wife called. She said she'll be late. Yes, of course. Still awake? It was very nice of you to wait up for me. - Actually I fell asleep. - Yes? Roberto gave me a ride. We were working on a project till late. You must be tired? You must be jealous. - Is it really worth it? - I don't know. But I'm not jealous, it's out of fashion. What are you doing? I drank from that. You're such a fool. I hope it hasn't come to that? Yes, you being upset I'm drinking from your cup. No, it's not that, but stop now or we'll end up arguing. No, I'm sorry, but you're the one doing everything to start. I've been working hard all day and what do I find when I come home? A kind word? A loving embrace? No, just your long face. It's not right. You make me laugh! You talk like you're the man. Even if I were, what's so fun about it? Right, there's no fun at all in this. It's Biagini. About that call to Rome? Yes, of course you didn't find me, I wasn't here! No, it's okay, it doesn't matter. Yes, Fabrizio, I'm sorry but I really have to go. Yes, I'm terribly late. We're having dinner with those folks from Milan, what a drag. Call me. Fabrizio, watch out for the Negroes. They're full of diseases! Bye! Do you like her? They call her the Antiguan hurricane! I've never heard a more appropriate nickname, what do you think? - She's not bad. - I think she's a bit small. Where I'm from, we say the smallest things are the most beautiful. - Excellent! - Don't exaggerate. Forgive her, my delightful little pet has taken leave of her senses. I've taken leave of everything, even love. Right, dear? - You don't seem to be enjoying this? - No, why? Quite the opposite, it was fantastic. Right, Fabrizio? Of course! Sorry, but I'm not the best company for these kinds of places. Great! Finally someone who has the courage to admit these places are boring. They're just for the tourists. I share the same view. - We are as well, in a sense. - Yes. At last! Here's the pleasant distraction I promised you. They're at your disposal. Except for the night, of course. What do you call them in your country? Hostesses for businessmen! Mr. Biagini, Mr. Varelli. You already know Dolly. - Lux and Milagro, I believe? - You're mistaken, my name's Myra. What a beautiful name. That says it all! I meant to say exotic. It's an exotic name. My compliments, you've finally managed to grab their attention. It means a lot to me that our Italian friends see the beauty of our country. I wouldn't say it all needs to be seen. Excuse me, this is my dance. I'm not used to this modern stuff, it's a little too fast. It's quite a success for my friend, getting a woman to obey him. - Some more? - It's your first time in Santo Domingo. How did you guess? You'd know that women here do what the men say. - Duty? - Let's say a vocation. - Are you Italian? - Yes, disappointed? On the contrary. We like Italians. Then it's the first time I'm not embarrassed to be one. Unfortunately, in many countries, we have a poor reputation. The Mafia, conmen, and other nice things. Frankly, we don't take too kindly to gringos, I mean Americans. - I hear you, when I was in Mexico... - That's a beautiful country. I was there two years ago, and you know what they say? Poor Mexico, so far from God and so close to the USA. It's true, unfortunately. What do you think of Santo Domingo? - Have you been here many days? - No, just four, I haven't seen much. Barrymore's only shown me plantations so far. You're hurting my national pride. We have many beautiful things here. You must see them. I couldn't ask for more. Actually, I'll start right away. - With me? - Do you want to dance? At last! It took this beautiful young woman to persuade you to dance. Sorry. I'm not very good at this. You're very good. Really. - Tired? - No. With you? Never. Besides, we had a deal, remember? You promised to show me some Dominican folklore. I'm a mujer of my word. - Don't you know mujer means woman? - Yes, hombre! How much? - Don't tell me you're a Taurus? - Yes, not you as well? Well I am! Two. Okay, here's 8 pesos. We need two chains, one for you and one for me. What do you say here? With pleasure! - Where are you? - I'm here. Don't tell me you brought that from Rome? Why? Don't you like it? - It's the ideal colour for Santo Domingo. - Sure, it's perfect! - How did it go? - I saw lots of interesting things. Interesting things? Sure you did, you son of a... Anything but history! You don't waste any time. To think that Lux told me... What's your girlfriend's name? Yes, Myra! That she's a bit shy. - So it's not true? - Cut it out. - You've gone all silent. - You never change... - You sing, I've already scored. - Have fun! Yes? Yes, thank you. Hello? Come on, Antonella. It's a pointless discussion. It's not me, you know what Mario's like. He says women should stay home with the children. - Why don't you rebel? - Sure I rebel! Fabrizio's always so kind. What was I saying? I was saying that I rebel. I do stay at home. I take care of my kids. But heaven help Mario if he doesn't take me to the cinema! Is that all? You're so strange sometimes. I don't get it. Don't you see? You're the servant, the babysitter, Mario's in charge. You just accept it... Let me speak, please. You accept his old-fashioned ways. And you see marriage as a contract that makes you inferior... but you accept it because he takes you to the cinema? Please! That's not true. I'm in charge in that house and I do exactly as I please. Yes, sure, maybe when you have to change colour of the carpet. Of course, he hasn't got a clue. Then he complains because I spend too much. But then we make up, and you know how it is. You mean you make up so he'll sleep with you? - What's wrong with that? - You're being conditioned. Don't you get it? Then sex isn't a free choice, it's the opposite. You're making yourself inferior. You have to submit. You think you're equal but you become an object. You think so? I just know I like it. All this stuff's so complicated and difficult. I don't really understand much of it. I just know I like it. What is it that you don't like? If you're referring to the cocktail, I don't know yet. If I was referring to what Antonella said? - Yes, Fabrizio, defend me! - I'm not sure it's worth it. - She says I'm an anti-feminist. - I'll say you're even worse. I say you're old fashioned and stuck in medieval times. - Aren't you free to do as you please? - No, that's too easy. What freedom are you talking about? The freedom I took? That's right. You don't discuss, you decide. Now he's playing the victim! You see? They're all the same. He'd like to see me at home all day, doing I don't know what? Polishing my nails or watching TV? And instead she's fulfilling her potential, isn't that it? Yes, and that's what upsets you. That I'm doing something, that I have a job, that I'm independent. It's you who refuse to understand what it means to me. It's ticklish! I've booked a table at place nearby, what are we waiting for? Yes, otherwise we'll ruin your night with these discussions. Look, the blame for our misunderstandings is your fault and your fault alone. - Come on, Laura, that's enough. - Sure, as you wish. You're independent, okay. But alone, all by yourself. I thought certain choices should be made together. Sure, I know all about your choices. The difference between us is that you exercise your superiority with money. - The master pays so they're in charge. - You know that's not true. It really, really bothers you that I earn my money and that I do as I please. I buy whatever I want and I even put money in the bank. - Certainly not in the house. - Now it's all coming out. You're never wrong. Never! - Why don't they have a baby? - How do I know? Ask them. Are you two having a baby? Yes? What a pity! I'd have a baby with Fabrizio! I'm just saying. I almost forgot... I'd like you to wear it. Keep it for as long as you're here. I soaked it in holy water. I love you. - Do you like it? - Yes, it's wonderful. Even in the ecological sense, and you're wonderful as well. - In the ecological sense? - I'm being serious! I'm starting to realise something important, that you really are a woman. You're such a fool! What else would I be? I mean you're different to other women I know. Especially your wife, right? If you knew how many times I've heard this. It's not just her. I mean women in general. They're becoming complicated in a world that's already very complicated. Maybe it's your fault as well, you men. Maybe you don't understand them. Maybe, but at least we try. With them, every conversation becomes a drama. With you I can talk for hours and hours, you listen to me... - and that already feels like a miracle. - Maybe because we're more submissive? Or dumber? Have you ever thought of that? Is it true or not that Dominican women enjoy doing what men say? It's not hard, you know? Deep down, you're just naughty and spoilt but you also inspire sympathy. Damn it, why won't you admit you're how women should be? Simple, instinctive, real. Careful, we're also jealous and violent sometimes. - Actually, always when we fall in love. - Yes? Myra! Come and see! There are cannons and anchors! Come! - No! I'm scared! - You can't swim? Not well, Dominicans don't love the sea very much. - Come! - No! I'm too scared! This is the bar. Mr. Biagini, a call for you from Rome. - Tell them I'm not back yet. - He's not here. - So you're leaving? - And you've decided to stay. - Yes, I think so. - You want to know what I think? It's probably bullshit, but I wish I had your courage. Saying to hell with everything; the wife, the house with a mortgage... - Your career, everything! - Don't forget that favour. Yes, don't worry, I'll say you weren't well. The doctor advised you to delay your departure, okay? How's it going? Everything okay? What's in there? A woman? I wish! No, just a gift for my wife. Listen, now you've decided to stay, don't disappear! - Okay, Barrymore. - You're a real friend. Just because I'm driving you to the airport? No, for everything else. Will you do me a favour? Seeing as Fabrizio's fallen in love and it's partly your fault... - Keep an eye on him. - Okay, but I can't make any promises! Let's go or you'll miss your flight. Good luck and bon voyage. Hi! How are you? - What do you want? - Don't be so fussy! - We know each other well. - Let go of me! Let go of me! Why won't you leave her alone? Do you know him? - I've never seen him before. - She knows me real well. - You mind your own business! - Drink less! - Come on, let's go. - What do you want? Go away! Quit bothering me! Go away! - So, 8:30. - Yes. - I'll be on time. - And I'll be beautiful! - We'll see. - Stupid! I love you. The Ambassador Hotel. - What you do you want? - To make love again. - You're crazy! Who are you? - You know who I am. Try to remember. We made love a few years ago and you weren't bad at all. - Go away or I'll scream! - No, it's not worth it. You wouldn't want people finding out you took part in an orgy. Try to remember. You were mine and someone else's. - Help! - Shut up! What is it? Who's there with you? Help! I've never told anyone. But it's different with you. It's right that you know. I was sixteen. But I might as well have been ten, twelve... I was a very happy child. I was a clerk in a drug store. My boss asked me to deliver two bottles of Coke and a bottle of whisky... To a customer's house. I went. A man answered the door. There was another one inside. They wanted to offer me a drink. They kept insisting. The room was all lit up by a multi-coloured lamp. There was little light. I don't even know how long I was with those two. - You didn't tell anyone? - No, they wouldn't have believed me. You should have told your parents. They would have reported it. I was staying with my aunt. My folks live in a village 50km from Santo Domingo. What use would it have been? - All they'd have done was suffer. - I understand. That thug who attacked you, was he one of them? Yes, it was him, the man by the pool. So he's stalking you. We've got to stop him. He won't do anything now. My friend saw him as well. - There are too many witnesses. - I'm starting to like this country less. No, he isn't a Dominican. I think he's Puerto Rican, and one of the worst kind. You can't stay here. I'll get you a room in my hotel. You'll be safe there. Now go and get ready. I promised you dinner, remember? - Hello? - Great, you've found yourself a Negro. Of course I know. Don't play ignorant now! Come on, stop it! Varelli's wife told me everything. Yes, she got her husband to spit it all out! You're all the same. So you're in love... What's going on? I can't hear anything. Fabrizio! I was saying, you're a real asshole! You've fallen in love with some Negro whore. The classic dumb Italian asshole! I'm not surprised. A coloured woman. Idiot! If anything I've been a fool right up until today, okay? Listen, I won't stand for... What? No, wait a minute. If you're done listening to yourself let me speak! Sure, I know, you'd do anything to upset me. You've never liked me having a purpose, a job... You've always tried to sacrifice my personality. You don't want a woman who thinks, you want an object to serve you. But the woman object, the woman robot, is finished! I'm tired of your nonsense and your feminism, got it? I'm just sorry I can't tell you to your face. No, I'm not done! You haven't understood a thing these last ten years. You make me sick! No, let me speak! I haven't finished! Being with you, I'd forgotten the most important thing. That there are women who just want to be women and nothing else! No, you're the one who just doesn't get it, my poor Fabrizio. How much does your whore charge to let you call her your slave? You want to stay a little longer? Sure, go ahead, I don't need you. I've never needed you. But come back? No! You have to! Because I don't give a damn about you but I give a damn about other people. I don't want them saying you dumped me for a coloured woman, got it? Go to hell! Myra. - Has Miss Suero gone out? - Yes, she checked out. Thanks. - Myra's not here. - Can't you tell me where she is? - Where can I find her? - I don't know. - Did she come home last night? - I don't know, Myra's not here. Barrymore! Dolly! Is Barrymore in there? - I couldn't sleep last night. - Where is he? Want to swim with me? I feel lonely and I want to make love. Dolly, please, you've got to tell me where he is? It's urgent! - Who cares? He's not here now. - Yes, but where is he? - Please tell me where he's gone? - I want to make love! Idiot! Follow that car. Don't lose sight of it. Stop. There's a woman in danger, I'll give you 20 pesos if you come in there with me. No, it's too dangerous. Thank you. My regards to your wife. A drink? How about a whisky? Bring us two whiskeys. Influential friends are always useful. That Puerto Rican will be dealt with and you won't have any more problems. But be careful, don't forget the police can have your repatriated. Remember, you don't have any money or an income in this country. Yes, I know, that's why I'm looking for a job. It will take at least a year to sort everything out with my wife. The house and all the rest. Italian justice is slow. Yes, my friend. Justice is lazy everywhere. Yes, unfortunately. If you've decided to stay, I'll tell you a story. Mine. You know I was a soldier the first time I came to Santo Domingo. I was a marine, we stopped here after twenty days at sea, you can just imagine! The drinking, the women, I lost all sense of time. Until one morning when I woke up half-naked and penniless on a beach. The military police took me back on a stretcher. And I swore I'd never set foot in Santo Domingo ever again. A marine's promise, no doubt, given that I came back. Even if it was for work. I've often tried to recreate the adventures of those first few days. But between you and me, I still haven't managed it. And that's why I stayed. - You've done well for yourself. - I can't complain. It's a generous country for anyone with the drive to succeed. - Yes, but... - Listen, I like you. I want to help you. I need a partner. I'm offering you a position in my company. I'm not sure, I don't know the language and that could be a handicap. I don't think so. Besides, Spanish isn't hard. How are you for money? A friend's sent some money from Italy and I've got enough for a while. - I have a problem, a house. - We'll fix that, I know someone. - Thanks. - What about that woman? - Disappeared, like that. - Don't worry, she'll turn up eventually. You see, women are unpredictable but they're not stupid. - 130 a month is a lot for two rooms. - But we're in the centre. Yes, okay, but I don't... I heard you talking to your wife. You needed time to think, to decide. - I needed you. - No, Fabrizio. You were about to make a decision that would have completely changed your life. My presence wouldn't have helped. Are you sure it's what you want? I am. I wanted to tell you that I'd left the past behind. And that I'd stay with you forever. I can't live without you anymore. I love you. This is our shack! - Do you like it? - I like it. How did you do it? Where did you get the money? Don't worry. Just tell me, do you like it or not? It's great, but sorry, why shouldn't I worry? - I did it all by myself with my savings. - Yes, but you shouldn't have. - Soon I'll earn enough... - I love you. You're crazy! Put me down! Thank you. It's great! Send this straight away, it's urgent, and check the order number on this one. Yes, he's here Mr. Barrymore. How are you? Good, excuse me for moment. Tell Matteo I'll be right down to check the paperwork. Excuse me. No, I'll take care of it. It shouldn't be a problem. Lucky you! Sure, have fun. Listen carefully. These sacks are ready to be shipped. Best to keep them near the door. - Then move those crates back there. - I'll move them over here? Yes, this area. The truck comes tomorrow. - I'm going back to the office. - Move those crates here. Come and see. These are the keys. And this is the car. What do you think? My goodness! Well? I'm supposed to get in that? Are you sure this thing starts? Me and her have a deal, if she doesn't start I'll kick her! - Shall we go? - Let's try. - Isn't she great? - Yes, this snail's fantastic! What did I say? We're near Barrymore's house, shall we go and show him this thing? Are you crazy? You should be at the office, he'll fire you! We've arrived. That's Barrymore's house. That's the Puerto Rican. That's strange. What's he doing here? Come in. I saw the Puerto Rican leaving your house! I don't have to explain myself to anyone. - He's a thug! - Christ, don't look at me like that! In business sometimes we have to look the other way. And unfortunately that man is the mediator in a deal I'm working on. I understand, but you can't work with people like that! Come on, less of the sermon. Believe me... As I said, sometimes we have to look the other way. I need that man but I'd never accept him among my circle of friends. That fact he's dealing with me should reassure you because he won't bother you. - Please, try to understand. - Yes, maybe you're right. Thanks for the maybe! Let's have a drink and forget about it. - Forget it. - A cigar? No, too strong for me. Sorry. Fabrizio. - What are you thinking about? - We've been together for four months. - Are you tired of me? - Well, let's see... I'm willing to love you for another 4400 months, not a day more. You're not homesick? No regrets? If you're alluding to my country and my friends, a few. But if you're alluding to my ex, none. - That's the nicest thing you could say. - I just told you the truth. Unfortunately, I don't really have a way with words. That's fine with me, I like what you say, I like how you say it. - And I like it when you're happy. - Tell me, do you like me when I'm sad? - I like you even when... - You're great! I'm not great, I just want to be your woman. Not your wife who ruins everything, just your woman. What do you call this marvellous planet? You were talking to that man, what did he ask you? - About this load. - This load wasn't scheduled. Mr. Barrymore told me about it. - I don't remember seeing it listed. - Shall we continue unloading? Yes, continue. I'll speak to Mr. Barrymore. Come, let's play a record. How do you not get bored? - I have a house and a man now. - Balls! I'm bored. I drink and sunbathe because he's useless in bed. They're part of that deal I told you about. Tomorrow a truck picks up everything and it's done. - Happy? - It's not about that. I just wish someone had told me rather than keep me in the dark. No one's scolding you. I'd have told you tomorrow. Come on, I'm sure it's also the presence of the Puerto Rican that's bothering you. But you see? He hasn't bothered you anymore. Believe me, business is business for everyone! Cheers! Good morning. Please. - Is the manager here? - No, he isn't, you can tell me. I'm lieutenant Gomez. This is a search warrant. We know this business is involved in illegal trade. Here? That's absurd. - Which ones do you want to see? - The ones with a red X. - Wait, I'll help you. - No, leave it. You see? Yes, but that's unbelievable. I had no... We were right. Thank you for coming of your own free will. I came as soon as I found out and I ask you to leave no stone unturned. Rest assured that's exactly what we'll do. - May I smoke? - You can smoke. Before Mr. Barrymore arrived you said the goods hadn't been ordered... and you don't know the name of the person who unloaded the crates. - So you have no suspects? - No. Nothing you can give us? You admit it's hard to believe? It may seem strange, but I don't... Mr. Biagini has been with me barely four months. Frankly, I don't see how someone can become a smuggler in such a short time. - They can, but we're not saying that. - I'm happy to vouch for Mr. Biagini. I have every faith in him. I want a list of all the staff employed by your company and trading partners. As for you, Mr. Biagini, we'll have to take your passport. It's just a precautionary measure. Yes, okay, you've got a clear conscience, you haven't done anything. But why get yourself into trouble to defend Barrymore? Don't forget, Barrymore vouched for me. He didn't have to do that. - That's all we need. - I know exactly what I'm doing. - Do I owe him or not? - Not this much. Listen to me, don't trust him. Myra, I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. Now relax. You'll see, the police will figure it all out. At least, I hope so. It's Saturday so let's have some fun. Go and get ready. It's for you. Hello? Yes, I'm Biagini. I'm Matteo, the warehouse worker. I need to see you about those crates. No, at the warehouse. It's a holiday, the place is empty. Hello? Hello? Police? It doesn't matter who I am, but if you want a lead on the smugglers... Go to Barrymore's warehouse. That's right, Barrymore. Matteo. Check the other exits! See if there's another entrance! So you confirm that Mr. Biagini didn't leave the house last night? Yes, how many times do I have to say it? - Just once if you'd tell us the truth. - But it is the truth. Fabrizio was with me all night. Why won't you believe me? And this? Ever seen this before? - Doesn't it belong to Mr. Biagini? - No, I've never seen it before. It's the weapon used to kill the warehouse worker. A pocket knife manufactured in Europe. What does that mean? You know the Puerto Ricans use them. Let's say also the Puerto Ricans. Did he receive any calls last night? We have reason to believe the warehouse worker made contact with Mr. Biagini. No, I didn't hear any call last night. We want to help Mr. Biagini but you don't seem willing to cooperate. - I told you everything I know. - It's what you haven't said. I'm warning you, I could arrest you for obstruction. Do what you want, I've nothing more to say. Okay, that's enough. Now we'll check. Bring in Mr. Biagini. We can speak freely here. I still haven't thanked you for not mentioning me or Jose to the police. Yes, okay, but I need a way out and fast. It's not just me now, Myra's involved as well. She even lied to the police and that's not right, she's innocent. It's the best I can do, if I confess I know Jose it would make me a suspect. - So the Puerto Rican is the killer? - Yes, I'm sure it was him. Now I'm not so sure. I can't believe a smart man like you let someone like him get the better of you? Yes, you're right. But you have to understand that I'm going through a particularly difficult patch. I've invested everything in the business and now I don't have anything left. That's why I didn't hesitate when he offered me the deal. Yes, goods at a reduced price, but I had to turn a blind eye to that delivery. That's why you didn't find the order forms. I see. Now what? - Now we're in his hands. - We are? The police don't have anyone else so one of us killed the warehouse worker. I'm telling the police I saw the Puerto Rican unloading those crates, okay? No, it's pointless. Where's the proof? The warehouse worker is dead. The Puerto Rican's disappeared. No, that scum has left us right in it. He's trying to set you up. He can blackmail me. He may even go after your woman. That bastard's capable of anything! No, god damn it! - If I could just get my hands on him. - Sure! And with a bit of cunning it might be possible. We need to find out where he's hiding and with money you can do anything here. - Okay, what are you thinking? - It's very simple. Find someone to get him to deliver him to the police. - I'd do it myself. - It's not your task. Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. Yes, I'm no hero, but the rage I feel inside I'd do that and a lot more! Listen, if I find out where he's hiding I'll let you know. Take it. Go on. You're in as much danger as me, perhaps more. You'll feel safer and no one's saying you have to kill anyone. - Yes, maybe you're right. - Good. We'd better split up. You hide somewhere. As soon as I find out something I'll contact you through Myra. Okay. Yes, Barrymore, I've got it. I'll write it down. Yes. Okay. Okay. Sure, don't worry. I'll go right now. Fabrizio, stop! Don't go! What about me? He'll kill you! - I have to do it! - No, please! Let the police deal with it! Don't you understand? I have to do it! I've got to make sure that man can't hurt us anymore, I have to do it! Please! Don't go! Please, let me go! Italian! Come and get me! Come, Italian! Come! You fell for it! Barrymore was right! This is patrol car 20. The yellow Volkswagen has just gone past. Biagini! I was doing some cleaning. You know I was worried about you? No, as you can see it all went well, it's a miracle I'm alive. - And the Puerto Rican got away. - I don't understand. Okay, then I'll be more specific. From my conversation with him, and it wasn't long, believe me... There's only one thing he said that I didn't understand. - What was that? - You fell for it. - That's what he said, you fell for it. - I still don't understand. Just stop! You're running the show and the Puerto Rican is your accomplice. You needed someone to put the blame on, that's why I had to die. Or rather, disappear! Isn't that it? I knew you'd figure it out eventually. Don't move! You're a smart man so you'll know I'm not kidding. The Puerto Rican is a bloodthirsty idiot but I'll fix his dumb mistakes! - What are you going to do? - I need you alive! Stop! How lucky, Lieutenant. You wouldn't happen to have a match? Yes, the Puerto Rican is just a hitman, Barrymore was running things. And we've been watching him for a while, along with our colleagues from the FBI Those forged dollars were being sent from the USA but we didn't know the receiver. It must be that blow to the head, but... Thanks. I can't figure out how they made you think I was guilty? It's simple, you weren't part of their plan at first. I believe Barrymore employed you based on your skills. Unfortunately, you were so good that you uncovered their scheme. So Barrymore tried to cast all suspicion on you, an Italian. And we thought you might be working for the American Mafia. - Damn, they had me good. - Precisely. And that knife was supposed to be used as evidence against you. But we know it was Jose Lara who killed Matteo, the warehouse worker. That's right, you should thank your girlfriend for that. She told us everything and I assure you she was very convincing. And that's where the Lieutenant's intuition and bit of good luck came into play. All we had to do was set up some roadblocks, we followed you... and we arrived in time to hear Barrymore's confession. Unintentional, agreed, but exhaustive. Thanks again. Couldn't you do me one last favour? Try to get that asshole. I tried, but I'm an amateur. I'd be grateful. Of course, when you want. Sorry, I forgot, can we make it Monday? Thanks. Goodbye. - What's going on? - I need to find a job. The world won't fall apart if you find one on Monday. Remember you promised we'd go away for a couple of days. - Where are we going? - I told you, Enriquillo lake. - It's a great spot. - Why didn't you add some rum? You'll have to get used to it, I like strong men. In that case, if you want a real kiss, get ready. I can't believe it's over, that you're free. Let's make a deal. We won't mention it again, okay? I spoke to the doctor, it's not serious. - What about you? - It's just a scratch. I didn't have any other choice. I'm sorry, Lieutenant. I don't know what you call it in your country, we call it self-defence. You're a free man, Mr. Biagini. - You're better keep an eye on him! - You can count on it. Thanks for everything. You know, I feel very weak. Let's see if that's true. Subtitled by the dogs with coral paws. December 2022 Many thanks to rgiff300 for the share God bless VHS
