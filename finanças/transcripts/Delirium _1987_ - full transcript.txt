Kim, put your head back slowly. More. That's it. Now move it forward again. OK, good. Caress her, girls. Act like you love it, Kim, come on. It's like you're feeling pleasure you've never felt before. That's it, enjoy it, yeah like that. Caress her legs now, Christine, that's good. Now, come on, Come on, oh! Move toward me. Show that you feel it, come on. That's it, that's it. Get her, Roberto. Ah that's fine, move. Great. Move around her, girls, and laugh. That's good. Look to your left, Kim. And keep laughing, all of you. Remember, you want to be possessed, Kim. Good, that's it. That's it. Keep laughing, good, sexier. Make it sexier. Just a few more, then we can stop. Keep it up, you're water nymphs, have fun, you're drunk with desire. Touch her lap, move around more. Offer yourself, Kim, you love it. You too, Christine, that's it. Good. More abandon, let yourself go. Surrender to pleasure. Now Kelly, take off your bra. You think it was a bright idea? Reshooting that story with Kim? Yeah, I guess so. Even if it's not the same thing. Don't tell me he knows his work, and Kim's beautiful. But you are something else. I'm getting cold in here. Well don't show it, you're supposed to be hot. I can't believe it's been three years. It's more like a lifetime. Where's the makeup artist? OK, come on out girls. Evelyn! Evelyn! Where's the makeup girl? I don't know, I guess she's inside. What do you mean she's inside? Here I am. Oh finally, I'm not paying her to sit on her ass. Look, the girls' makeup is running. Do you mind getting to work? How come your brother always get so mad? Look, we're losing the light. Here, let me help you. Gloria. Hello Mark. I'm watching you. You are? Yes, I'm going crazy. If I told you I was playing with it, would you come over to help me? Now don't be angry, it's not true. Don't hang up. I just have to tell you how beautiful you are today. More than usual. Are you wearing your panties now? No, don't pull down your skirt. You don't know how much pleasure I get just watching you. Do you want to let me see you in the nude? I'd be forever grateful. Listen, Mark. You've been watching a show right under your window that isn't so bad. Be happy with that, huh? You're not like those others, Gloria. You could put out my fire, all right. You're a sex goddess. You make my member throb with desire. It wants to penetrate your flower and explode- This is getting boring, Mark. And you're not very funny. Outline her upper lip a little more, here. Do you have much more to shoot? Oh, couple of hours. _ I'd say less. The light's going. Come on. Then I'll go inside and help Evelyn. You're all staying for dinner, I hope. Quel dommage. Kelly and I have to catch a plane tonight. We have a fashion show in Paris tomorrow morning. Sorry Gloria. Thanks anyway. Then bon voyage, au revoir. OK Kim, let's start over here. Tony, we're ready. Tony? Tony! This guy had just finished making love with a girl. I'm sorry, he said. If I'd known you were a virgin, I'd have taken more time. But honey, she says. If I'd known you had more time, I would've taken my panties off. You're a riot, Roberto. Evelyn. As usual the dinner was just perfect. Ah, what would Gloria do without you? You're the best at everything. Now now, don't be unpleasant. He doesn't have to work at it. It's a natural gift. Speaking of natural gifts. I found a gift for you. To my darling Gloria. Thank you. They're sweet. Well, after that little coup de theatre, I think I shall be going. Good night, thank you. Good night. I'm coming with you. The night is still young. Good night, Roberto. Thank you. Don't be late, Tony. Tomorrow we'll have to choose the pictures. OK, boss. Do you need a ride, Kim? No thank you, I'll stay a while longer. I came with my own car. OK. Aren't you scared to go home on your own? You never know who you might run into. Just as long as he's cute. Listen, honey. There are times when you and I have the same needs. I'm going to bed now. I want to be at work early tomorrow. The next issue has got to be especially good, seeing as you're back with us. I'm sure it will. Good night. See you soon, Kim. Night. Has it been long since you took an interest in the magazine? It's over a year now. Since the day of the accident. Feel like talking about it? Why not? You know, the day you married Carlo, a lot of people thought you were only doing it for his money. Well don't you believe it. I married because I was in love. No other reason. Never once did he ask me to stop posing in the nude. Instead he gave me the chance to start a magazine of my own. I was the one who decided to stop modeling and put all that behind me because I wanted to be with him and have his children. I was afraid I wouldn't have time for work. Besides there was Evelyn, always so efficient and ready to help. But maybe Carlo and I were too happy and Fate decided to teach us a lesson. I'll never forget that day he was killed. Awind came up and his speedboat turned over. He was like a child who was in love with a toy. Determined to reach a record of 200 kilometers an hour. Well he left me well off. The magazine, everything. And the memories of all we shared in this house. Now I have to start to live for myself again, as well as for Carlo. You're right Gloria. I'm afraid I bored you. Oh no, on the contrary. If I didn't have to get up early I'd stay here all night. You don't have to come with me, I know the way. Ah, it stopped raining. I'll call you tomorrow. - Bye. Bye. Hello? Your blonde model has just been murdered. Her body's floating in your swimming pool. Do you hear me? You're not very funny, Mark. I'd much rather hear your vulgarity than this stupid excuse to phone me. She was killed with a pitchfork. Believe me Gloria it wasn't a pretty site to watch. Didn't you hear anything? No. If you wanted to frighten me, you have. Now let me get some sleep, please. Too bad you turned the pool lights on. I might have been able to see the murderer's face. It might have been a woman. She had long blonde hair, are you listening? Yes. Do you want me to call the police? You're not putting me on, Mark. Oh, no way. So should I call the police or will you? No wait, let me go and look first. Listen Gloria, you'd better not. You won't like what you see there. Only a wild, crazed animal could kill someone like that. You'd better stay in the house. Evelyn! Evelyn! Evelyn? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just went into the kitchen to get a drink. Mark just phoned me. He said that he saw Kim murdered in the pool just now. And you believe him? That boy's sick, he's sick in the head. Don't pay any attention to him. Go back to bed, and forget it. Nothing has happened, I'm sure. Come on, I'll bet on it. Good night, Gloria. Good night. Shit on you! - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. Yes, the lighting's good, can you use that one? I don't know, I prefer this one, look. Yes, it's got movement, but so does this. And I like the line of her body. What do you think, Gloria? Oh they're all good, Roberto. Tony, I'll know you'll pick the right ones, and Kim is marvelous. OK, let's go with these three. ' Yeah. Oh, before I forget, Evelyn. Kim left her lighter last night at my house. Will you give it to her? She'll be happy to know she didn't lose it. Why don't you go into the other office to choose the pictures? 'Cause it's yours. Well in there I feel like a fish out of water. Well then put on your scuba gear. There's a shark waiting for you. Flora? I couldn't get her out. She knew you'd come in sooner or later. And so she waited. She's waited in there for a year? No, not quite, but over an hour for sure. Come on, find an excuse. She'll just come back another time. Ah, and I was feeling so good. Tear her to pieces, Gloria. Otherwise she'll tear you to pieces. Ah, welcome back, Gloria. And to what do I owe this pleasure? Are you here for the usual reason? I'd say suffering has enhanced your beauty, my dear. But not my willingness to deal with you. But why don't you want to sell me your magazine? I know there are better things you'd like. For example? To live. You might travel, you have plenty of money. Ah, my dear, when I think of how you were when I saw you for the first time. You were so provincial, and ready to do anything for money. I had to support Tony and my self. And as you can see, I did it. It's funny, now you're the one who needs me. Don't you ever think of thanking those who lent you a hand in the past? And who should I thank? Me, for example. You never helped anyone for nothing, Flora. Don't give me that. You're too selfish. But I was the one who got you started in modeling or you'd have turned into a cheap prostitute. You and your brother Tony didn't know where you next meal was coming from in those days. Why if it hadn't been for me you'd be walking the street. If you hadn't had the good fortune, darling, to have known me. Walking the street, no. A prostitute maybe. When there's nothing else, even prostitution's a way of keeping alive. How much do you want? This is funny, you know. Here I am the victor, when you fought off all those men. Oh, my men. They never meant anything more than a Kleenex. Something you use and throw away. You're all-so-precious, though. You know how to hit someone where it hurts most. _ldo? And you? When I said I wouldn't work for you any longer you did everything to ruin me. You even did your best to turn my husband against me with your vile lies. Well I'm not selling out, Flora. You better forget it. Now go. OK, when you're poor again and you're too fat to make outwith men, call me. You still have some capital. You know, those pictures you once posed for. I'd always be willing to buy them back again. I'm sure that you'd realize a good profit. Oh, naturally my dear, I couldn't offer the same price. Those photographs still have some value. But, mostly as souvenirs. There was another souvenir that you wanted from me and never got. And that you begged for. Be careful, Gloria. Don't make me change my feeling for you to hate. I warn you, the hate of a woman can be very bad. Evelyn. You know you shouldn't drink, it's bad for you. What's wrong? I found this under the door. Oh my god. Damn her! Inspector, take a look at this pitchfork. I found it in the gardener's tool shed. Looks like it's never been used before. Yeah. Strange. I've got a sample of the pool water. Take it to the lab for analysis. Don't think they'll find anything new. Just playing it safe. To the lab, too? Yeah. ' AW Sign of burglary? No, nothing. Did you see him? He looks like anything but a cop. Because you watch television too much. They always make us out to be different than we are. I'm sorry. Forget it. I'm used to it by now. Since I joined the force my hardest job is to get people to trust me. They usually take me for a hood. Please sit down, Inspector. I questioned that kid Mark. He didn't try to hold back. Told me exactly what he witnessed here last night. Appears absolutely certain he saw a murder. He's the only witness we have but I don't think he'll be very useful. All we know is the murderer was blond. But there are lots of blonds, both men and women, and wigs besides. But why send that photograph? And pose Kim's body in front of a poster of me? And why was she killed? Right here, at my house? If we had the answers to all your questions the case would be solved now. But by sending that photograph of her here it looks like it points to me, why? I don't know. And that's not the only thing that's baffling. It's either a warning or an attempt to implicate you. We'll investigate the background of that model and find out who her friends- Inspector Corsi. Excuse me. Can I send the men back now? Your breakfast is served. You know you shouldn't spy on your neighbors. It's not very nice. Have you finished? I'll do as I like. Your father called from London last night. But you wouldn't answer, he said he'd call back today. Well tell him I'm out. What about your mother? She's still on vacation. Enjoying herself. Anyway I don't give a good damn about either of them. Oh thanks. Holy god. The beautiful model's corpse was found this morning in a garbage bin on Via Calderara. Now you are the news vendor who discovered Kim's body, whose picture appears on the cover of this magazine. Tell us in your own words how it happened. Well, I'd finished unwrapping the new issue of Pussycat and was going to put the plastic in the trash bin when I saw her, poor girl. Then what did you do? I called the police. And how did you feel, what was your reaction'? Why, I was shocked and sick almost. The see her like that, eyes staring at me, dried blood all over her dress. Especially after seeing her so pretty and sexy on that cover picture. What, hello? You ought to thank the murderer, huh? Mark, how can you say that? The one who killed her did you a favor. Your magazine's gonna sell like hotcakes now with her picture on the cover. Isn't it? Now back to our studio for the rest of the news... A favor? Only a sick kid like him could've come up with an idea like that. Why do you talk to him? It's just that I pity the kid. Who are you calling, Evelyn? The printer. Oh Rogiero, is that you? Good, I was afraid you'd already left. Listen, I want another press run. Oh, you'd already figured we'd need one, good. Yes, that should do it. Thank you, I'll talk to you later. My god Evelyn, do you think we should be exploiting her murder? Gloria, you're a publisher, you can't afford to pass up this chance. No, it's a mistake Evelyn. Gloria, I'm always trying to increase our circulation, and now's the perfect chance- I want you to call Rogiero back and cancel it. What for? By doing that do you think it will bring Kim back? You know it wouldn't, so why? Yeah, I think Evelyn's right. Even though the killer didn't mean to do you a favor. How many copies are they printing? Well, come on. Here it is, the printer told me how many they ordered a little while ago. Oh this is awful. Pour me a martini. Oh, forgive me, Millie. Isn't it a little early to be drinking? It's not quite 9:30 yet. Oh well, my liver's about to explode anyway. The photographer said he should be finished with them by noon. And you say that Sabrina says she won't be coming back. That's right, she signed an exclusive contract with Pussycat. At double the salary that we offered her. That bitch is getting the best we have. Sometimes you just hit on the right idea by accident. Come on, I'll show you the studio. Fine, I'm curious. Here's the set. Well, what do you think of it? Like it? I think it's fantastic. And this is where I see Sabrina. Lost and alone in a world out of time. Haunted by surreal nightmares. Well, what do you say? It'll cost me a fortune, but how can I say no to you? I knew you'd like it, thank you. If you'd brought Evelyn, it wouldn't have been so easy. That's the reason I only brought you along. Oh, I've got to talk to the set designer. You mind waiting? How long will you be? 15 minutes. OK, I'll have a look around. Hey Johnny, you shouldn't scare the girls like that. Yeah, I suppose you're right. But if she'd seen you without your makeup, she'd have probably fainted. When you see the chief of the other tribe, you pick up your sword- Yeah, but don't forget in the last shot I had the sword, Gloria. Alex. How are you? Fine, and you? OK, let me look at you. Ah, you're prettier than ever. Listen, I've got a 10 minute break. Do you want to talk for a while, do you mind? Why not? I didn't recognize you dressed like this. I know. How longs it been? Over three years, hm? Yeah. And it was my fault. I don't want to rake over the past, but I want you to know that deep down I knew you were the right girl for me. And that if we kept going together it would've ended in marriage. And the very thought of marriage really scared me. You're born free, eh? There's a right time for everything. And what frightens you today, for example, tomorrow might seem a good possibility. You mean you're saying you're a changed man, you? I could. Ah, you'll never change. You'll be a villain till the day you die. Am I really that bad? No, but it's very disturbing for the girl you're with. I guess with Carlo it was different. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to talk about him. I don't mind. After all, if we hadn't broken up I would never have known Carlo. I guess I owe you one, Alex. Ah, well hang on, I'm about to make you a proposition. Come on, Alex, you've got me on pins and needles. What's the proposition? Am I supposed to believe that a leopard can change his spots? Yeah, why not? The big bad wolf's been changed into a lamb by a very sexy Bo Peep. Oh, Alex. Bang, bang- Gloria? I saw the lights on. I didn't know you had company. I'm sorry. Don't tell me you're upset because your little brother found you making love with a man? No, I'm not upset. Just a little uneasy. Hey, give me some more smoke over here. Now girls, try to move together, yeah. Now take that shirt off and get rid of it. Yeah, get rid of it, that's it, good. Good, now turn slowly. Lift your hair up for me. Lift it up. That's it. Fine. Good. Now you come out of the smoke but not too fast. That's it. Now the dream starts to change into a nightmare. Becomes macabre. Very slowly, remember. That's good, like that. Keep shooting, Roberto. Now, start undressing her. Sabrina, you've got to show disgust and excitement at the same time. You're being transported. And you mummies, you desire her, touch her legs, too. Open your eyes, Sabrina, more. That's it. Now, raise your hands toward her breasts. You want to feel the warmth of her skin but the bandages prevent you. Sabrina, start pushing them away now. Show you're frightened now. Now, change your expression to one of pleasure. That's it. Good. Thanks. Tony just called. He said the pictures are going to be great. I want you to have a look at the proofs for the next issue. Has Alex called me? Here? No. He's been gone more than a week and he hasn't even called the house yet. Maybe he's having trouble with the phones in Yugoslavia. I know the problems Alex has. They're either blondes or brunettes. Didn't you say he'd changed? Yes, but I don't know how much. Look. On page one, a photo of Sabrina. On page three, answers to Gloria's letters. Anne Wolff says she's almost finished writing them. Did Corsi call me? Oh, please don't mention his name or he might come back again. He spent days in here asking us all kinds of questions. Come on. Can we go on? Roberto? I'm going with Sabrina. I could see she's the kind of girl who's not exactly lacking initiative. I'll see you later. Tony- Yeah, what? You gonna take her back to our studio? I don't know. Enjoy yourself. It's so hot in here I can't breathe. The windows are all open. In fact, I'm beginning to feel chilly. Come on, darling. Don't take it so badly. You know it happens to a lot of men sometimes. Yeah? You must be an expert. You don't have to be insulting just 'cause you're angry. Better to just laugh it off. Yeah, you're right, I should. Guess I work too hard. Hey now, come here. Let's try again, sweetie. I'm not the kind of girl who'd leave a good-looking guy like you unhappy, don't worry. Hello? SDOIetQ? Hotel Grazia? Oh good evening. I'd like to speak with Signor Alex Wirth. He's an actor, he's shooting a motion picture there. Oh, there's no one shooting a film there now? I'm sorry, thank you. Good bye. Let me know if you need me to pose or for anything else. Yeah, sure. Ciao. Ciao. Good morning, Tony. Hi. I hear sales are booming. They should. Thanks to all the work you've done. I've been calling Sabrina for days. She's probably gone out of town. Perhaps on a job. Just like that? Oh come on, you know how models are. Yeah, I know. But I find it strange because she was expecting a call from me the next day to let her know how the pictures came out. If she was leaving the next morning why would she ask me to call? What you're saying is that she asked you to call the night you slept together, is that it? Oh! Oh, no... Not again. She was found this morning by some children. She was in a pond. The coroner says she's been dead a few days. I was probably the last one to see her alive. The last one, no. You're forgetting her killer. What's that strong odor of perfume I smelt on her, it's strange. That perfume helped kill her. Essence of tuberose. You mind explaining, Inspector? How could perfume kill her? It attracts bees. They must have been infuriated first. Then, attracted to the odor on the model's body, they began to sting her. It's certainly a devilish way to murder. What about that photo? You've convinced yourself the killer's real target is you, right? It seems to be obvious now. Look, try not to worry. And don't look for motives, because that's our work. I think from those photos it's obvious I'm going to be the next victim. And when I asked Corsi he said not to worry. He'll find the motive, he said. It's my picture with those dead girls. If it's not for that, for what? It's a threat, that's for sure. But maybe he just wants to scare you. But do you think that someone who's already killed two women only wants to scare me? To commit crimes like that, he must be paranoid. One can't guess what he's thinking. But there's something else. There's some detail I seem to have forgotten. Madame, may I go now? Yes, thank you. What were you saying? That poster of me with the dead girls, it's an old picture and only one person could have the negative. ' Who? Roberto. I gave him all those old negatives to hold that I got back from Flora. You have to tell Corsi. I better not. _ Why? The police would suspect him at once. They'd slap him in jail right away. Two girls, both were models, and he's gay besides. He probably doesn't have any alibis for either of those murders. How would you know that? I'm guessing. You know, he spends the night going around looking for men. I didn't want to tell you, stupidly. A lot of those negatives and a lot of valuable other stuff were stolen from my place. I'd invited around a couple of kids... Roberto are you trying to tell me those negatives are in the hands of the murderer now? Probably. But not necessarily. It's not absolutely certain that the negatives the murderer has are the original ones, Gloria. That big poster of you in the shots with the bodies could have been made from a dup. Sorry, I don't understand, Roberto. Technically, there's no problem. All you've got to do is take a photograph of a photograph. You've got as many negatives as you like. Obviously when you print them, the quality becomes more grainy. But once you've blown it up to six feet by six feet, it's impossible to tell the difference. Then we're back to where we started from again. Hope you're not too disappointed to find out that I'm not the murderer. Oh no, no don't think that, I never believed it was you. Don't turn the light on. I have light. Because I want to admire you, Gloria. No, let me go. Shut up, you'll force me to murder you. Want it? Tell me that you want it. Tell me! Gloria. Gloria, it's OK. It's OK, nothing's happened. It's just a bad dream. Oh god, it was terrible. Doctor Lorenzi's here. Thank you, you may go. Hello, Mark. What are you doing? I'm taking my daily walk. Just stretching my legs, Doc. Keep on treating it as a joke and you'll never get out of that chair, my boy. You quack. You think I'm enjoying myself, being nailed to this chair day after day? No, I know how much you're suffering. But I also know that your paralysis doesn't have any physical cause. That's what you say. My father, my mother, that's what you all like to think. You say there's no damage to my spine, eh? So you figure all that's wrong is right here. In my brain, huh? Therefore... It's simply my fault that I'm crippled. Sounds like you enjoy playing the victim. Yeah, sure. I like being that. You know what, Doctor? You're pretty smart after all. The truth is you don't want to walk. You have a mental block because you feel responsible for Cinzia's death. Yes, you're right. If she hadn't been in my car, Cinzia might still be alive. And I'd be walking. And we'd even have been married. MY god. Alex. Hmph. The only thing warm in here is the sauna. I called Spoleto. They told me you weren't there, and that you weren't expected. That's right. I went to Greece, because it's a co-production. Well the least you could do is pick up a phone and say where you were. What's important is I'm here. Am I important? Very- No... - Come! - No! No, please! She work in blue films, also? Only this one. But the public seems to have forgotten it. Gloria's quite respectable now. Do we have to watch any more? Leave it alone and sit down. Good morning. This must be important if you called us all here. I've decided to accept Flora's offer. You're going to sell the magazine? I have no intention of working any longer here after all that's happened. It seems the best solution. But it's not as though you killed them. But my picture's with those dead girls, are you forgetting that? Or doesn't it worry you? Well it won't help selling the magazine. If the killer wants you, it won't solve the problem. Or are you gonna go somewhere and hide'? Throwing away all your work and ours won't stop that crazy. But if I stay here he's sure to kill me. . HEY- What's your hurry? Oh, what a fright. Say, what are you doing here? I came to get you. Our appointment, remember? That girlfriend of mine is expecting us. But how did you know I'd be coming here today? I know everything. And what I don't know I imagine. Isn't today the anniversary of Carlo's death? Yes. There we are. Thank you, much obliged. Are you really sure you want to do this? Well, since I haven't sold the magazine yet, I thought I'd model again. Like in the old days. Hey, I haven't got anything against the idea. I think it's great. I'm coming. Sorry. Hi, Tony. Susan, this is my sister Gloria. I'm glad to meet you finally. Tony's always talking about you. Oh? What does he say? Oh, he thinks you're the greatest, the most beautiful, the most- Hey hey, come on now. Tony always exaggerates. Yeah, this place is perfect. What's over there? Children's clothes. Gee, I didn't know it was so big. Hey, be careful, she'll see us. Frankly Tony, I think you're asking a lot of personal customer service. How could I refuse Tony anything? He's filled the house with flowers and candy. Yes, phone calls, caviar, champagne. You have a very persuasive brother. What do you think if I posed with just this wind jacket on? Ah-ha, good idea. Or maybe better yet, nude on skis. While modestly wearing a scarf. Would you like to visit the other floors now? Oh yes, I would. Pretty good shot, huh? This is the men's department. This is still men's clothing. Men's sportswear, shirts, sweaters, underwear, slacks, you name it. They're as stylish as our clothes now, aren't they? Yeah, we do everything we can to please the ladies. They're all becoming more vain than we are. Oh, you're just jealous, come here a minute. Tony, please. Listen, what are you doing, later? Maybe we could have dinner, or- OK, but calm down. You come on strong, don't you? Hey! Hey! Come on, it's beautiful up here. Tony! Susan! Come on, you can play with fire later. You want to leave me alone here, huh? Come on up now, Tony. No, no! Tony, no! Not you. Oh, god. What happened to you, Tony? Now it's your turn, Gloria. You can't escape. It's your turn to die. Susan? Susan, where are you? Susan! Now it's your turn, Gloria. You can't escape. When we went to the department store there was no trace of either Tony or his girlfriend. They'll probably turn up in a few days, but who knows where? Gloria? Drink it. Evelyn, would you open the curtains? It's so dark in here. Oh... Is that better? It wasn't a nightmare this time, was it? You have to fight it, Gloria. We all have to. I know I have to, Evelyn. I have to go on living. I'll go get your pills. I won't be long. If you need anything, there's the maid. I'll be right back. Oh no. Oh my god! Wonder where we'll find the other body? Yeah, I wonder, too. Hey, wait. All right. Looks like the same killer, all right. Yeah, I'd say so. What do you think, Inspector? Am I going to be the next victim? Yes, hello? High Gloria, it's me, Alex. Alex. How are you? Oh I'm so glad you called. You finish your film? You back? No baby, I'm sorry. But I'll be in Rome Monday. Gloria, I miss you. Hello, who's speaking? This is Inspector Corsi. Stay away from that photographer Roberto. But do you suspect him? You mean he's the murderer? I haven't time to explain now. Just do what I say. And don't open your door to him. We're coming right over. Gloria, let me in. I have to see you. Evelyn. Evelyn! Evelyn, Oh! Gloria! Wait! Gloria! Gloria! Gloria, wait! Help me, somebody! Why are you running away? Gloria! I have to talk with you. It's me, Roberto. Stop, wait! Gloria, help me. I'm sorry. I can't understand any of this. Roberto obviously must have hated women. And especially you, Gloria. Then why did he kill Tony, he liked him? It's difficult to know a killer's mind. But in the department store, what I clearly remember had a woman's voice. No, it wasn't a girl. The voice you heard at that moment might have sounded like a girl's voice. Assuming you're right, why doesn't the rest of it make sense? The car that killed him, for example, why didn't it stop? I've got to blot it out or I'll go mad, too. Who is it? This is Mark. I see the police are there again, what gives? How does it feel to be surrounded by death? Stop calling, you fool! Our battle seems to have finished. Though you certainly were a tough adversary. I'm sorry my dear, I'm putting you out to pasture. You know I suppose I really ought to thank you. I'm getting rid of a lot of bad memories. It's a shame you're so insensitive, Flora. I would've given it to you for the asking. Are you so proud of yourself now? Evelyn? Evelyn? Kio, where's Miss Evelyn? She's gone, madame. She took all her things. She left this letter for you. Gloria, forgive me for leaving like this but I worked for you, not the magazine. So what sense would it make for me to stay on, regretting what we no longer have? Good luck. She must think I have a will of iron. She wanted me to go on with the magazine after all of those killings. Yes, hello? Hello? Oh no. Tony! Dear god, no. Now it's your turn, Gloria. You can't escape. It's your turn to die. Come out, show yourself! Kill me if you must, I can't take any more! It's your turn, Gloria. Now it's your turn, Gloria. You can't escape. It's your turn, Gloria. How would you like to die'? The police took the pitchfork I used to kill Kim. And I didn't have time to get more killer bees that liked Sabrina so much. But I'll think of something. Maybe on the order of how I did Susan. Tony? No. It's me. What's the matter? Don't you like me? Don't you like me? Oh no. I haven't become a transvestite. I'm not even very good at that. But why, Tony? But Why? You should know, Gloria. You're the only one I love. I've always loved you. Since we were kids. Tony, you killed those poor girls. What made you do that? You ought to thank me. Yeah. That bitch Kim was trying to take your place as a model. And Sabrina your place in bed. And I didn't want that. That little salesgirl Susan was trying to trap me. Even Roberto wanted to betray me. No Tony, no. I'm dead, Gloria. Everyone thinks I'm dead. I could have run away. But I figured while you're alive I'll never be free. But first, I want to see you naked one more time. No. No. No. No. No. Tony, stop! Help, help! And now, strip. My 90c- For the last time. Just for me. No Tony, please don't ask me that. No. Do you even know what you're doing? Oh yes, I do. You belong to me, only me. Go on. I've always loved you, Gloria. Every part of you. Your lips. And your tongue. And the curve of your white throat. That leads to the valley between those rose-capped hills. Now I want to see them. Nobody else will ever caress your body again, Gloria. Oh, no. No, no. Yes. Take this off, too. No. I said take them off. Oh Tony! Is my brother alive? Yes, he'll make it. Though I'm afraid he'll need a wheelchair the rest of his life. I'm sorry Inspector, she's still in shock. She has to sleep. Yes, I'm going. I hope that from now on, life will be better for you. We'll see. Get well soon. You must try to sleep now. Call me if you need me. Did I frighten you? I'm sorry. I just had to see you. Here. Thanks. Gloria, you won't mind if I phone to tell you that your beautiful? More beautiful? Of course you can, Mark. Do you know that I'm getting better? I'm beginning to walk a little now. _ I'm so glad. It's good to see you again. And you, you get better, huh? Yes. Don't forget me now, promise? I won't. :: Re-synchronisation ferneiva::
