The Copper You better leave that thing running. Good evening. Can we do it? -Yes, I'm ready. See you tomorrow. -Take it easy, Erwin. Keep quiet and hands up! Go quickly! Now go! This is the police. Hold up on post office eight. Thanks "Kruger one", a call: Hold up on post office eight. Perpetrators fled on motorcycle with a sidecar Escape route: Hachestrasse Bismarckplatz Over. Kruger One! Kruger One! Come in. Hold up on post office eight. Perpetrators fled on motorcycle with a sidecarbrother Send KrugerThree to the Gartenstrasse. Then escape to the allotments. Gruga 3 gruber 34 gruber come This is Kruger 3. -Drive to the Garten and close it off! Attention Kruger four. Follow the post office robbers to Pappelalle. Quick! Run! Stop or I'll shoot! Hands up! Freeze! Robbery Division, please connect me to Homocide. It's really strange. Your father gets all the interesting cases. Dennert 2 here. The Chief asked you to take over the post office hold-up. We're the Robbery Dept. but a wounded clerk died on the way to the hospital. So, can Dr. Screibner come to your office? Yes, I'll be done in a minute. Well... so if you don't want to admit it today, we'll just continue tomorrow, We have time. I didn't kill the girl. I didn't, Commissioner. Really. Five women murdered in six weeks. That's a lot. Oh my God, Commissioner, I didn't do it. Well, what else did you do on that evening in that area? Two people recognise you without a doubt. I didn't kill anyone. -Good. Tomorrow we'll hear other witnesses. -All right, Mr. Dennert. And first we'll have your wife, of course. Please! Not my wife! She won't survive that. -Gosh! You're under suspicion of murder! We can't consider any sensibilities like that! I'm not a murderer! But you stole something out of that car. You admit that, don't you? Well, finally. Write it down. So, now you tell me, and take your time... How long have you been married? More than twenty years. My wife is the best wife in the world. Then why did you do it? You've worked honestly all your life and done nothing wrong. But a couple of months ago the company fired me. And hired someone else, because he's...younger. So, that means he's cheaper. And I stood on the street and walked around looking for another job. But I couldn't find one. Everyone said I was too old. No over fifties, they said. And I'm fifty-five. They're throwing a man on the scrap heap. You wouldn't understand that. You have no idea. I'm similar to old scrap myself. The same could happen to me tomorrow. But you'd still have your pension. My wife has a heart condition. The doctor said she cannot be agitated. I can't tell her anything about my layoff. I left the house every morning like I always did. In the daytime I sat around somewhere in the city. And after closing hour, I came back home. And at the start of each month there was a shortage of money. Yes. And so I... In the evenings when I walked through the streets... I saw how careless people were most of the time. They left their cars unlocked. And in the cars, their coats, briefcases and what ever else. You only have to take it out. And how often did you do it? Five times? Ten times? Three times. And now my wife will find out about it. She won't survive that. -Don't worry about your wife. I will talk to her. I can deal with women, more or less. I'm so glad that its out now. And that you don't think I'm the murderer. I didn't believe them anyway. This man should wait outside. -Yes, Commissioner. Good day, Father. -Good day, my son. You had this poor guy under suspicion of murder? We won't make any progress this way. At the highest level, they're upset that the case isn't solved yet. Dr. Schreiber, you know how it is at the highest level. What's up with the post office hold up? Missing moneybag. 12, 000 marks. The third man must have fled with it. I'll go to the scene. I mean, it's my case. Do you want to interrogate those two? -No, no. I can tell you exactly what the protocol says. If its different I'll eat a small hand-broom! Commissioner, we were sitting in a bar. Then a stranger came by but we don't know what he looked like. Suddenly the stranger was gone and we were caught. This is about money. Money! Well, of course, we didn't know that! Mr. Dennert, if you're making fun of everything, we can't discuss it. Dr. Schreiber I take it very seriously! Maybe more than you. May I? -Yes of course. You shot a postal clerk! -I didn't! I didn't either! You didn't do it and you didn't do it. Nobody did it. As always! Lead them off for my son to interrogate! -Yes Commissioner. MURDER? 500 Deutsche Mark reward. Don't come outside, Uncle. I'll make my own way home. No, no. I'll walk you to the tram. I won't let you go alone until they find the killer. Oh, that short way! Good night! All right. Good night, my child. Here's the motorcycle's track. I took a sharp corner. But then had to brake because he didn't fit through with the side car. I know one of our customers drives like that. Willy Goede. Did you search this area for the money bag and bullet casings? Doing it twice can't hurt. Keep on searching. Come here! -Yeah? It's the lead seal from the moneybag. Search this area thoroughly! A five Mark coin. -Five Mark! The guy was in a hurry to get away from here. And? So you don't want to give a description of your friend? Spit it out! Well, we were comfortable sitting in a bar and a man came to our table and... I don't really know what he looks like any more. Me neither. He asked if we'd go to the post office with him. And so we went with him. Take them away! The old man is always right. It's no coincidence that he's one of the best Commissioners. If the criminals give him a title like that... "The Copper" Sounds so romantic. But when he takes a stab he usually finds something. Good evening, Mrs. Mertens. My name is Dennert, can I talk to you for a minute? Of course, what's it about? Don't be afraid. I'm from the Criminal Investigation Dept. What's that? -It sounds worse than it is. Sometimes we're very harmless. Your husband fell into a very unfortunate story. "Unfortunate story"? Did he do something unethical? -Unfortunately, yes. Is it bad? -It won't cost his head. He's been unemployed for a couple of months and... What? -He didn't want to tell you... And so that you didn't notice, he... He stole things. -Oh my God! And that's why the company fired him? Did he do something there? Oh no! He was honest and hardworking. Like thousands of others They're pushed out the door because they aren't young enough anymore. He lived for his work. Yes, that's exactly it. In his frustration, he did this foolish thing. He is a victim of circumstances. If I could change the circumstances... But I am also a handyman of so-called justice. And what will happen now? If he's lucky, he gets probation. But the most important thing is that you have sympathy for him now. That you'll faithfully stay with him. Always! Whatever comes! And later I'll ask some of my acquaintances... I have some connections. Maybe I can do something for him. And if you promise me... that you be really nice to him. If you promise that... then I'll ask him in. I made sure that for the time being he's free to go. Thank you. If you promise to come in quietly. Mertens! If you'd just said something. Now everything will be alright again. So, we got that done! Now we drive to Br√ºckengasse no. 8 where we'll sound out our friend Goede! Yeah? Open up! -What do you want? Open up! It's the Criminal Investigation Dept. Good evening, Commissioner. Good evening, Willy. I'm always happy to see familiar faces. Did I wake you? I was sleeping like a stone until now. -How long have you been here? I haven't left the house at all. I thought you might have gone for a ride on your motorbike. Oh, what are you thinking, Commissioner. How long you been sleeping? -All afternoon, I'm not well. Please let me try something here. Well the bed is pretty cold. You have a cold bum. Tiptop, your shoes. Clean and dry! I told you I haven't left the house today. But these here are wet. Probably a friend of yours put them here, right? Too bad the leather dries so slowly. I don't understand what you mean. You can't. It's beyond you. Please take these. Look at this! This is burdock. The little trip did happen after all. What did you want from me? I only wanted to show you something interesting. You drove your motorcycle. too close to the fence. That happens. But if daddy notices it, that's bad luck. Your bad luck! I object to these suspicions. -Don't talk nonsense! Get dressed. Or should I take you in your pyjamas? Open up, please. What's going on here? Who's that? Your fiance? If you don't mind. Ursula, tell them I haven't left the house all afternoon. Well then, confirm it to me! You sat all afternoon on his bed and pet his little hand, right? No, I was out. But if Willy says he was here, it's true. Isn't that so, Willy? Of course! -I'm moved to tears. But you expect me to believe everything he says. Who are you anyway? -He knows me very well. Chief Inspector Dennert. Your fiance is under arrest. A little involvement in a post office hold-up. Where a postal clerk was shot dead! Shot dead?! Willy? Say something. This must all be a big mistake. The don't worry! And if you're not back by tomorrow, I'll get you an excellent lawyer. And where will you get the money from? -Don't worry. Unfortunately, I'm taking him with me. Go! -Hold your head up, Willy! After you. There's a system behind these murders, Chief. All victims were blonde. And all murders happened around 11 o'clock at night. So we have to run the search using these facts. You're right, Dr. Schreiber. But I'm afraid our colleague Dennert is relying too much on intuitions. But we can't take this whole thing out of his hands like that. But I mean, he has to retire soon anyway... Almost forgot I've had the form lying around for weeks. Yes, one moment. I'll get it for you. Here you go. All right. Turned sixty four weeks ago. My retirement documents arrived. That's not why I said it. I know, but good thing you reminded me. This is where the girl was murdered. Around ten the doctor said, right? A dark Volkswagen was standing there around that time. I told you. My tank was empty. I went to the next station and bought a can of gasoline. Yes, the station attendant confirmed that. Come, I have a bigger map over here. This is the murder scene. Here is the car. Here is the gas station. So, you came this way? -Yes. And the same way back as well? -Yes. The murderer would have to go this way. But he couldn't have because people were here sitting in their garden. They would have heard a cry. But they wouldn't know where from so paid no attention. Are you sure no one crossed your way here? He could have escaped in that direction, but that way goes only to the water. No, this is the way in question. And this is where you should have seen him. -I didn't meet anyone. Sometimes one is mistaken in his memory. I didn't do anything. Excuse me, you were asked here as a witness. Because we have to follow every lead. So you have to give an account of yourself. Sorry, I can't tell you any more. -Well then, thanks and goodbye. One moment! Where were you last night? Last night I visited clientele and then drove home. About what time was that? -Ten past nine. Ten past nine? That's precise, isn't it? Did you check the time? -Yes. Family heirloom. They still work the best. -Nice. You can go. What do you make of that guy? -He's not important. Oh, I don't like him that much. Why is that? Every normal person gets nervous when dealing with the police. He doesn't! He has a firm answer and sticks with it. If you have a clear conscience! I'm afraid you let yourself be influenced by prejudice too much, father. I thank you for that tip. Hopefully you'll make something decent out of me some day. But tonight, I'll have a private life. Coming? -No. I'll do field work at some night clubs. When one of these boys gets money, he becomes careless and wasteful. I agree. Never knows how long he'll benefit from it. Well then, enjoy yourself Bye Dad. Ah, Mr. Dennert! - Mr. Doctor... May I introduce you to Mrs. Schramm our new investigative assistant? Good day. -She's from Southern Germany. Good luck in our department. -Thanks. She will work in Homocide. Not scared? -I know Ju Jitsu. My father says that's only good for Rock and Roll. Goodbye -Goodbye. His father is against all modern methods. He's head of the Homocide Division. But I don't think for much longer. Mr. Dennert! -What? Please give a speech. -Uh yes! Keep calm! A fanfare please! Quiet! Mr. Dennert is going to talk! Dear tough guys and tender girls! It's an honor and great pleasure to be able to be part of this party tonight. I thank you for the invitation! Can you please let me through? When I look around this room, I see at least 250... ...Maybe 280 jail criminals! And we don't want to make a social class divide between jail and penitentiary! I put some of you through a lot of trouble, haven't I? But in general we've come along pretty well. Bravo! Fritz! What happened? You're making a face like lemons at the door. What's the matter? I have to go sit in tomorrow. For six months! For the first time! -For the first time... For the first time! At the first time, it still hurts. You're still thinking you could never get over it. But after time, little by little, You'll be getting used to it. Her first one was a... -Sailor! He had a tattoo on his chest! He was wearing ocean-blue pants and she was so very embarrassed. He took her hand and promised her faithfulness! And he gave his word. He'd never take another one after her. And in the morning he went aboard! Fritz you choirboy, come sing along! All of you! At the first time it still hurts. You're still thinking you could never get over it. But after time, little by little, You'll be getting used to it! "Being faithful" he said: "I can do that!" "Can try it!" -"But I've never been before!" If its a boy I'll call him Johannes. If its a girl I'll call her Marie. He didn't show up at their wedding. And he wasn't around for his baptism either! Well and she... She took another. And now Johannes call this guy "daddy". At the first time it still hurts. And you? Why are you out already? Good behaviour! A good character is always useful. -Yeah! But you, Vest-Heini, you've got to find another job! Why is that? -Because it's nonsense! A pickpocket, that old fashioned! -Well, unfortunately, boss. Look over there, that's where the celebrities are! I believe that! And the sparkling wine is flowing like water. But just you wait, I'll get you too one day. You've got to be good for that, boss. And you old dear, where did we always meet? At the stocktaking sale! -Yes, at the stocktaking sale. But you're old enough for a pension, aren't you? Yes, I asked for it already. -Smart girl. Look at this! Our good old "Copper"! He knows everyone! Yeah, he isn't like the young ones. To them everyone is just a number. No, no, no Mr. Dennert. Why on earth did you become a detective? Because he wasn't good enough to become a good crook! Don't be so disrespectful! Did you hear anything suspicious? -No. But this evening may still become worthwhile. Hello, Uncle Dennert! Oh, there is my little cutie! My Evie! Come say hello to your uncle. Evie, what are you doing down there? -I can't open the door to the toilet. Well, you've got to push hard. But Evchen, you don't say things like this to guests. What a cute little thing she has become. She gets it from me. You wouldn't believe it. With that father... He always acts like she's only his! I mean, I have a part in this too. -Oh, my sweetie. Mr. Dennert! If I put 50 pennies in this machine here... And down here a chocolate bar comes out... To whom does that chocolate bar belong then? To the machine or to me? Listen to that, Mr. Dennert. He's only that cheeky when other people are around. When we're alone he obeys. Well I made a decent human being out of him! No. that was rheumatism! When you're climbing up a building and you notice that you can't move your left arm anymore. Then it's time to be honest! Oh Evchen, my goodness! I almost forgot. -Quickly! You can't fight nature. Was "Silver Franz" in here recently? "Silver Franz"? No! Hey honey! Are you gonna buy me a whiskey? Yeah, next time I get a raise! For someone who looks like you, I can't wait that long. Now leave us alone. We have to talk business here. Later maybe? -Much later. Anything else suspicious? I mean "well filled pockets". No one who comes here could have that much money. Not in the back room either? Which room? -Don't pretend! I mean, the gambling table! No, not there either. Today is a bad day. Cigars! Cigarettes! Ten filter tips please! Which kind? Those there. Maria, I'll be working with Branning in a bit. Isn't that too dangerous? -He doesn't want to drop the main act. Branning? The drunk knife thrower. No one wants to work with him anymore. But I need money! Wow! You're pretty brave! Are you going to drink something? -No, thank you. I'll keep my fingers crossed for you. -Thank you. You would, Mr. Dennert. Three at once! -Nothing less. You should know that. Come sit down with us. -I can't. I have to check on Evchen. Buy her a nice chocolate. With greetings from Uncle Dennert. Thank you, Mr. Dennert. Always a gentleman. When that stops, it's going to be pitch...Pitch... Pitch... -Black! Why is she doing that? They arrested her fiance. Now she wants to earn money for a lawyer because she thinks he's innocent. And he's been cheating on her the whole time! Somehow I feel sorry for her. And now I'll show you a shot. With a Mexican clasp knife. The target is only three centimetres and is in my partner's mouth. Good job! -Thank you! May I buy you a liqueur? -Yes, just let me change first. A rum! Double! M√ºcke! -Another round! This lonely young lady over there looks to me like she could use a drink too. If you're buying! Ma'am, do you doubt that I'm a gentleman? What's your name? -Helga Helga, my angel, come here. Sit at our table. Let her! Looks like you have a good stroke of luck! Every little bit helps! May I? What's your occupation? You must be new here if you don't know me! Joking aside. Well, first I was a specialist in pick-pocketing. Well, isn't that how you usually start? And then my child, I got so very bored with it. And so I specialised in international hotels, adornment, jewelry. Big things. And!? -Cheers! Are you still doing that? -No, no. Now I'm only dealing with the really big things. Also post...um. Bank robberies and such things? Well, whatever comes along! So you're a really prominent one?! Prominent one? How could you?! I'm an international one! Excuse me for a sec. I've got to go to the bathroom. My child, we all have to. Every once in a while! We're still here as well! -That's right! Yeah, you are! Investigator Schramm speaking. I have a man acting very suspiciously. In the bar Mucke on the Schwedenplatz! Of course! I'll try keeping him here until then. Thank you, Mrs. Schramm. We'll get on it! Policemen always assume the worse straight away. And if you saw the Commissioner who arrest him, you'd.... What was his name? Dennert, I think. Oh, him. Well. he's supposed to be a real good guy. You know him? I've read about him in the papers a few times. I just don't understand how you can arrest a totally innocent man! That seems to be a Miscarriage of justice. You don't believe me? -I do. I'd even help you if I can. But I haven't introduced myself. Dennert. What? -Yes, you understood it right. Dennert jr, his assistant. The old copper's son. They call me Dennert two. That is mean! You sounded me out! Not at all! All of what you just told me. I knew already. I won't be going home alone today! I feel like I've one foot in the grave. You have to bring me home, ok? I'm much blonder than you. Nothing will happen to you. You better take me home. -I'll take you both home! That's him! That guy over there? -Yes. Yes, that's him! What's the matter? You really made a good catch there! Dennert Two- do you want to arrest me? This is Lord High Commissioner Dennert. Well ma'am, it's not that easy to catch murderers. I beg your pardon, sir! You couldn't know that, you're new. Should we go? Hey Mucke, I want to pay for real now! Did you make sure your shoes were clean?! Yes, of course! Yes! -"Of course" nothing! Yesterday you brought all the dirt from the street inside! Dear Mrs. Kuppe, could we maybe get something to eat? What?! In the middle of the night?! Maybe we'll find something in the kitchen. But be quiet or she'll hang us! She has a screw loose! There are sausages. -But we'll have to heat them! Oh no! We'll eat them like this. And there's also potatoes. Well, with cold sausage you can eat cold potatoes. But only with mustard and pickles. Father? -Yeah? I have to make a confession. -What did you do? I met a nice girl today. She must be really special if you're crazy about her. I'll bring her home some time. I always like to meet nice girls. Is she pretty at least? -I think so. I can't count on your opinion, you're in love... I'll have a look at this young kiddy myself. You're pretty great as a father. Thanks for the flowers. Only in the office... What's with "in the office"? Well, let's not talk about it. I have a different point of view. By the way, Dr. Schreiber said in the office today, there's a rumour that you're retiring soon. He would like that! He's been waiting for my position for ages. But first I'll finish the ripper case. I won't let anyone take that away from me. That probably won't help you, father. Retirement age. Retirement age? Look! this is something I showed this morning at the office... to eight people who were a lot younger than me. And no one could reproduce it! You young people these days, sometimes you're little megalomaniacs. You think you're the centre of the world. Of course you can walk places faster than us old folks. Also you could possibly fly to the moon. But once there you suddenly don't know what to do. Because you're lacking experience. And here, heart, lungs and so on. It's all great! Look! Reproduce that, Junior! I'll try! See? And they want to put me on the scrap heap. I could do that a dozen times! That's unbelievable! In the middle of the night you're eating the sausages I got for tomorrow's lunch! And the potatoes were cooked for the potato salad! And making so much noise that one can't even close an eye! If you don't know how to behave yourself, I'll look for another position! Everyday I could get another! With my own car! And TV! -And with a helicopter! Uh, let that old spitfire leave! Did you say something? -Yes, exactly what you heard! I see! Then I'll leave straight away! This night! But hurry! the first tram is leaving in a bit! Should I help you pack? -Don't you dare! Now we're rid of her. That old spitfire! Well now? Who is going to do the chores? Me! You can hire me as a housewife once I've been retired. Good night, father! -Good night, my boy! Essen Chief of Police In my opinion, someone new has to take over. Someone with modern methods. But Mr. Dennert really wants to finish this case. You can't just take this thing away from him. Maybe his retirement is coming at the right moment then? I would never have guessed that Dennert was due for retirement. He looks like someone in his 50s I won't say anything against him. Mr. Dennert is a great colleague. But recently...well He's a little too intimate with the underworld. But that's why he finds more than the rest of us. He's often difficult but he's had great successes. "Has had", yes. Well, he reached the legal age! I won't let the Minister tell me again that we can't get this ripper. I took the liberty of... taking a closer look at your private life! Look here. We found that you obtained insurance of over 12,000 Marks for your mother. Where did you get the money from? -I saved it! We contacted the revenue office who said that it's impossible for you to have saved 12,000 from your salary. Uh yes! Well, I made various cut-backs, not always by the book. If you tell the tax investigation about... It's all a little strange You also could have paid the rate continuously. So you saved the money and deposited it on the 17th. Yes, I wanted to give it to my mother for her 60th birthday. When is your mother's birthday? On the eleventh. Then why didn't you give her the insurance policy on the eleventh? 100 marks were still missing! -Ah right. Thank you. That's enough for today. Why do you ask me here over and over again? Interrogating me like a criminal? Don't. It all has to be recorded for the files. We are a bureaucratic corporation. No offense meant! I hope I don't have to bother you again. Good day! -Good day. What is it about that man? You're giving him a hard time! Did you notice? At least today he exploded once! And what do you think that gets us? Do you think he did the post hold-up? No! But... he could have gotten the missing money bag somehow. Coincidentally, its exactly 12,000 Marks. But father, this is entirely circumstantial evidence. The circumstantial evidence interests me the most! Homocide Division, Dennert. One moment... For you! Dennert Yes, Mr. Chief of Police! I'll come up right away. So! Now it's time! The Chief of Police wants to talk to me. Don't worry too much about it, father. They can't just retire me now! Now of all times! Maybe its something entirely different. -No, no! They want to get rid of me! I've known that for a while. We all regret very much that you're leaving us. I don't want to! I'd love to stay here. Yes, we'd like to keep you here, but... You know exactly how it is with us criminal investigators. I mean, in the case of the ripper now. For me, it's an affair of honor. Maybe the climax of my life. And now that I've found a very explicit hint... You'll hand the files over to your successor. Files?! You can't deal with these things through files! I asked you Mr. Chief of Police, I ask you, please let me finish this one and only case. It's the rules, Mr. Dennert. My whole life I worked for laws and rules. And especially now... Mr. Dennert. The whole thing is decided. I can't change it anymore. Here you go. I wish you many happy years! In retirement. Thank you. Mr. Dennert, on behalf of my colleagues... I'd like to tell you how much we liked working... No speech! Tell me, did you go nuts? This gift must have cost a fortune. And all these pretty flowers for an old guy like me. How am I meant to get all this home? -We'll send an official car. At the taxpayers expense. You are some guys. I won't stay a minute longer! It's become too pathetic for me. As government property, the identity card, duty pistol and so on. Kuhnert, would you be so good as to hand those in? And send the receipt to my place. And the file about the ripper is part of it as well. And you, my Hansilein? You're singing so nicely. But you're getting retired anyway. So, gentlemen, goodbye. Goodbye! -Goodbye Commissioner. For the last time. Do you want to take this with you? "Dennert" No, no thank you. Do you already have the new one? Dr. Schreiber I thought so! Goodbye -Goodbye Commissioner. I'll drive you home. -That's nice of you, my boy! Bad situation for you, father. But... Make yourself comfortable at home. I'll tell you what happens at the office. And you have to get me a grandfather chair! And a long pipe. And you will have to teach me this head-shaking. By the way, I was put into the Homocide Division by Schreibner. Well, that's something. Congratulations! Thank you father. Put that stuff here somewhere. I'll put it away myself. I've got to clean anyway! It's all higgeldy-piggeldy! I don't have to! No one is waiting for me anymore. Hey Hanselein! You don't have to try that hard either any more! You're in retirement as well. And now the weather forecast choppy winds coming from the northeast will bring Good morning, father! Morning! I'd like to know what's "good" about this morning. An unidentified woman was found after midnight in Dreilinden. The woman was 28-30 yrs old. She had blonde hair and wore a blue dress, brown shoes and a rain coat. The circumstances lead us to believe that it's the same... ...it's the sixth one! To whom five other young women fell victim to in the last six weeks. And I'm out of action! I have to go to the office now! Have to? Shame on you! You're allowed to! It's not my fault! You could bring me a little memo, which is lying in my desk drawer. But father, I can't do that anymore! Why not? I just wrote it myself a couple of days ago! Then you were still in the office. Okay, it's alright... Goodbye father. -Goodbye. I won't let my daughter go to the factory any more. Woman murdered in Essen 5000 DM Reward! I've 3 who work at different places. I can't pick up all of them! The girls and women in the factories are beginning to panic, Chief. We got information that job performance has declined already. Maybe one has to increase the reward, Chief. You can't just make it happen with more money. But something has to happen on the police's side! The press is already rebellious. We'll do what we can. I put a very competent man in charge. Good morning, Mr. Dennert. -Good morning, colleague! Good morning, Mr. Dennert! -What? You still know me?! But of course! Sooner or later you'll give that up as well. But of course, Dr. Schreiber! I'll always be here for you Thank you! -I'll definitely find him again! Excellent! -I will never forget his face! Just call me when you need me! -Alright. Thank you. Uh! Commissioner Dennert! - Good day, Miss. Kuhn! I would love to... -Love to what? I know everything about you! Alright, goodbye Miss Kuhn. I know all about you! Good morning, Dr. Schreiber! Good morning Mr. Dennert -How is it sitting in my seat? This'll be interesting to you. I found the first reliable witness! The first woman who actually saw the man and can identify him! Last night he tried to hold her up! Make yourself comfortable! But fortunately she managed to escape! The woman who just left? Miss Kuhn? How do you know her name? -I've known her for 10 years. She comes as a witness for every murder to make herself look important! I based the search on new aspects! See: a murderer of women, that's a pathological case. Yeah. but I'm not a doctor. I know! See, I'm not even sure only one person committed these murders! Excuse me, that's a dull theory! I know. You tend to look at things more "intuitively", if I may say so. But I prefer to proceed systematically! I check on everyone with similar offenses... And now I have them all under control! What if its an outsider? Then you don't have him under control! Mr. Dennert, I respect you for your earlier achievements but I am now leading the department! You will have to let me decide how I go about it! Of course, of course! I only have one more demand. -Yeah?! Could I maybe get a little memo that I wrote, from the files? From the files?! But, you're misunderstanding the situation... You're sitting here as a private man now. Excuse me...I'm a little limited. -What? My time is limited, Mr. Dennert! -May I ask you to um... Yeah! Yeah, for sure. I'm leaving already. Kicked out of your own office after 40 years! Well, let Ms Kuhn explain it to you! Detention Centre Essen We knew from the very start that you did it. Your friend Emil said the same. -You're lying! He even claims that you shot the post office clerk! No, I didn't shoot him! Who then? You only drove the motorcycle! That would make things easier for you. It would be even easier if you hand over the money bag! You'd be in a better position in court! I don't have the money bag! Too bad! And who did you shoot?! Who? Emil. Well, Emil We already found that out. His fingerprints are on the gun. And why did you do it? I'm engaged! My bride is very demanding. She wanted a car, coats, jewelry. Miss Brand is a very nice and modest girl... She would never have had... Ups?! Why are you so upset all of a sudden? Because it's a dirty trick that you want the girl involved too! You seem very interested in my fiancee's fortune! Miss Brand denies knowing anything! Don't give her such a hard time! Please record that! My fiancee was well informed about our plan. You're a scalawag! Interrogations over. Let him sign and take him away! And? I'm sorry for you, he confessed! No! Willy! Is there anything I can do for you? Ask that guy! Come. I'll take you home. Attention! Kruger 25, come in for "Kruger"! Kruger 26 is listening! "Kruger 26", an assignment! Drive to Eichenalle at the corner of Birkenstrasse immediately! A suspicious man has been hiding in a phone booth for the last half hour. "Kruger 26" here. Understood everything. Help! Help! Over there! Behind the bush! What's the matter? Why are we always interrupted? No, ma'am, that can't be right! Yeah? -Thank you! So far 14 false alarms this evening. -Panic! There will be more! Only the one right alarm, that one doesn't come! Good evening, Mister -Good evening. Does Mr. Schmitz, who lives nearby, park his car here? Yes! -Is the car here? No, Mr. Schmitz left this morning. I see -For a little while. Thanks. I'll come back another time. Good evening! Could I talk to Mr. Schmidtz? Unfortunately, my son isn't home! That's too bad! I was just passing through. My name is Friedmann. Could we talk for a few minutes? -Yes of course. I'm a draper. Sadly my salesman died and someone recommended your son to me. It's all very nice here. Can I look around? I don't even know if he'd be interested. Please take a seat, Mr. Friedman. Before you give someone such an important job... ...you might want to know a bit more about them. Too bad he's not around. I heard good things about him. Yeah! I believe it. There are only good things to say about my son. He only lives for his work and his mother That's me. Yeah, that's hard to find among the youth today. I can only congratulate you. He hasn't married either? No, he was engaged once. But it didn't seem the right thing. He's on his own! He works a lot, right? -Travelling through the Ruhr area. Does he come home late at night? -Yes, often. May I offer you some coffee? -Yes, very nice of you. Sometimes I sit until after midnight and wait. Because I can't sleep if he isn't around. It's nice to have a mother like that. -But he's also a very good son. A few days ago he said: "Mommy, you don't have to worry. If anything happens to me, I've taken care of everything. -I see! He took out a life insurance policy. Only for me. I like that. Being cautious. It's something I'm asking of my employees. I can show it to you. -Yes. Where is it? He gave it to me as a belated birthday present. What? 12,000 Marks? Uh, where did he get all that money from? He won the lottery. Right after my birthday. 12,000 Marks. I see. The lottery. I'm sorry I didn't get to meet him. Don't you want to leave your address? I'll write him. Or may stop by again. Someone is always in, right? -Yes, but not Fridays! That's when I go to the movies. You shouldn't be afraid. Nothing can happen to you. Thanks for believing me, but the judges may have a different opinion. Let's see what my father wrote about it. He's rarely ever wrong. What did he write? "The arrested G's fiancee appeared, Her behaviour was odd as well." See! And your father's never wrong. Well, tonight he'll get to know you better. I believe you. Mr. Dennert, do you believe me? My father always said a cop must rely on his feelings. I never wanted to believe that, but... He's right. And? -I'm doing Miss Brandt's hearing. I see! You were thinking things would end differently, weren't you, Miss? I wasn't thinking anything. Your fiancee let you in on all of it. That's already on record. You're an accessory to the murder of an innocent. Is the protocol ready? Yes, one sec. Miss Brandy denies that she knew anything about the holdup. Of course, she does. What did you expect? Unfortunately, that won't do you any good, Miss. Sign here! Not there. Here. A nice bird! Did you ever cook a goose? No, but that doesn't matter. A son like you, a father like me! We could cook a hippopotamus! Didn't you get instructions? There must be a cookbook somewhere That's typical of you! Cookbook! You do it intuitively! You've got to take the feathers off, don't you? Plucking, its called! Why do they have feathers anyway? -So that they don't catch a cold! The geese in stores never have any. Well, I bought this one from Mucke and he probably hunted her down with his van! If I know him... I tell you, it's stinky in here. -Yes, I get the same impression. You can't breathe in here. The goose has been in the oven for a couple of hours, but its still hard. Even though I did it exactly as the cookbook said. Well, cookbook! Let your father do it! Open it. You forgot to disembowel the beast! Well, excuse me. Someone's got to tell me! That's Ursula! -Which Ursula? You know which. I invited her to dinner. Alright, I'll open up! Hopefully she has a cold! Good evening -Good evening Am I too early? -No. We aren't ready yet. But if you're lucky you're going to get roast goose for dinner. Tell me. Don't we know each other? Aren't you Willy Goode's fiancee? Yes. I didn't know that it was you, Miss Brandt. I'd like to talk to you now before you see Harry. Yes, go ahead! My boy really likes you. But he's still young. He doesn't understand his job, entirely. And now that he has his first big case, he starts seeing one of the suspects. Well, that's strange, isn't it? So you want to say, that isn't good for your son if... No! No! No! That's not what I meant. -I understand very well. You want to leave already? -Of course! That's what you want. That's why you said all this! Don't you want to say hello to Harry? -No! You're entirely right. I don't want to cause Harry any trouble. -I thank you. I'm definitely not leaving for you! You haven't set the table yet. Where's Ursula? -She left. Why is that? -She remembered she had to work. Something's wrong here! Shouldn't we eat first? You let her go by herself? -She came all by herself! I'll follow her! What about the goose? -I want to know what's going on! Ursula! Ursula! No! No! No! No! Help! Imagine that! Such a beast going around at night! And every time it strikes, a woman loses her life. And its always a blonde? Mr. Dennert, you know you've done some crooked deals, but... But something like that we don't understand. It's unbelievable! Someone like this is walking freely and we don't dare walk the streets anymore. So, do you want to help me? -Yes, sure! So long as it's not against the law! No, don't worry! Don't wear yourself down with it! Another round of schnapps! -Honey, can you pour them? And throw in a penny for some music!! Mucke! Dennert! If I didn't know you, I'd say you just made dastardly plans with my husband. Why are you smirking like that? I really don't like it when you... You have something planned. That's right! Did you forget who you're married to? Mucke, "The Night Terror"! That must have been before my time. I haven't seen anything from this "The Night Terror". Good one! Daddy will you take me to bed and sing me a nice song? Yes, my pretty girl! Tell me, Mr. Dennert: Does she look like me? My spitting image? Thankfully she has been spared that unpleasantness. Well then, Mucke... Friday at eight. Program change. At eight. Morning! -Morning, my boy. We've been out all night. But the guy is untraceable! -It was like that every time. But this time there is someone who saw him and who's still alive. And that's great! Father, you... You're talking as if it's just another case for you. But for me, it's about Ursula. -I know that. So?! You wanted to break us up behind my back! Otherwise none of this would've happened. Sorry, I only meant well. Why are you interfering? Because you're future matters to me! If I may! Please leave me to worry about that! Alright, whatever you want. You don't let me get a word in anyway! Leave me alone! I'm old enough now! Well, is that thanks to you?! I still have the honor of getting you this far... to where you don't poop in your pants anymore! Mr. Investigative Assistant! -Don't scream like that! In my house, I scream as loud as I want to! And if you don't like it....leave! If the thing with Ursula ends badly, it will be all your fault! Of course! Us old folks... It's always our fault! Yes, it is! So I'm also being retired as your father? Yes! And I'll be doing something about the private detective Dennert Senior as well! These old geezers. I really love them! You rug rat! My Hanselein! Maybe I really am crazy! Say: "Peep"! Here you go! -Thank you. Good day. I'm here. -Thank you. Uh, it was all like a terrible dream! But now it's over. It's good to have you here! Ursula! Yes? When you ran away from our place... I realized that we belonged together. No matter what happens. That's the reason why I followed you. Love is sometimes strange, isn't it? But I believe its all destiny Us two as well? I believe so! But now you... You've got to recover! I promise you'll get well really quickly! Tell me, Ursula! Can you still remember what that man looked like? It wasn't a face, it... It was horrible! And I don't see it clearly any more. You're the only eyewitness. Yes, I know. Time is up. -Yes, I'll leave! Goodbye! -Goodbye! Come back soon! -Yes soon! The window in the kitchen is open. You climb in. Open the apartment door from the inside. I'm honored to be working with you, Commissioner. But that's pretty high! -Mucke! Don't you chicken out like that! Mr. Dennert, back me up if anything happens. I wouldn't dare go home otherwise. My wife has a forceful disposition. Erotic literature! But not important. Happens in the best of families. Are you looking for something specific? -I like being surprised. What do you think these are? Those are two grenades! -Strange. I had one at home as well. As a reminder of the war. Probably deactivated. This one isn't. Mr. Dennert, can I take this watch, maybe? It's old-fashioned anyway. Or maybe this wallet. As a souvenir of our work together. If you steal anything here. I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget! What does it say here? My dear Joseph, this is in memoriam of our engagement. The hair colour seems to be blonde. Good evening, Mister. -Two litres, please. Hey, what's going on over there? Fritz! -Yes, boss? There's a suspicious light moving up in that apartment. The old lady went to the movies and the son's out of town. Burglars? -You better call the police. Police speaking. Burglary in Schutzenstrasse 4. Thank you, police are coming! Cops! Here, through the window! One escaped over the roof. We got the other one. And? He insists on talking to Dennert Junior. Bring him in. Caught red-handed! Father, you? What's the matter? I couldn't do a normal house search at Schmidtz's. So, I had to find another way. -And who helped you? That won't be revealed, its against thieves' honour! You got yourself in a very uncomfortable situation. Me even more so! -Am I going to jail? Well, you know what your colleagues will say! Mucke! Come here! Look at me! You! If you've got into trouble again I'll teach you a lesson! Give me a schnapps! You really can't be left alone for a second! Good day, Mr. Schmitz. -Good day! Back from your trip? -Yeah. Please put your car in the garage. Lot of action in your place last night. Why is that? -The police were there! The... Police? -The burglars! Was my mother home? No! She was at the movies, yesterday was Friday. Uh, right! -They got one of them! Good day, Mr. Dennert. Lena! -The apartment door was open. Uh, you still know me. -Yes, of course. Where'd you come from? How long have you been out? -For three days. So I thought I should visit you. It was so very nice of you to take care of my boy the whole time. So I baked a little cake for you. I hope its all right with you. Of course! Will you brew us some coffee along with it? Absolutely! Come let's go to the kitchen, us two beauties. And then we'll boil water and you'll tell me all your... What's happening now with "Klemm-Lange"? Did you already start with your stealing again? No, no, no. -You can tell me, I'm retired. No! I think I will stop that entirely. My boy started earning money himself so everything's a little easier. Don't you have your housekeeper? -No, thank God, not anymore. And who cooks for you? -The Copper himself. Here with coffee and sausages, that's high class. But I'm actually more of a canned food specialist. And that over there? I've got to take care of that next week. I don't have dishes anymore. And where is your son? Well, he's out of the house. He lives on his own now! He didn't agree with his father anymore. Then give me your apron! You know how I've longed for housework these last 2 years. You steal like a raven and have the heart of a gold pheasant. But I wouldn't steal anything at the "Coopers"! You know that, Mr. Dennert. Can I come with you, Daddy? No Evchen, Daddy will be right back. Just sit in the car for a while, alright? And then we'll go visit Aunty Elschen! He hangs out in that restaurant quite often. What does he look like? -No idea. I don't know him. Let's speak to the owner. Come on! Your car! Evchen! Evchen! I don't know how to... I can't talk very much right now. I don't know how to thank you! Here is my address! -One moment please! Please one more photo for the evening paper! I only want the best for his son! -I do too! The two of us want to stay together. So?! Forever? Yes, we want to marry. -Without asking me? Well, he is... old enough! And you seem to know what you've got to do yourself. If I offended you, don't be cross! But don't tell Harry I was here. And? How are you? You didn't even say hello to your father. Yeah, we're finished. I don't live at home any more. Because of me? -Yes and no. But, there are some extremes, you know? My father is still very active. -But that's great! Yes, of course. But that's exactly why we get in each other's way. Yes, I know. But you have to understand him. He has nobody else. So he told you all about me? -No, he didn't. He only apologised. - I brought you something. Thank you. Harry! I'm all alone. I only have you. And I can't lose you. Hey Harry?! -Yeah? What's the matter? That's him! -Who? The guy who attacked me! I am sure of it! The man my father always suspected! "A brave saviour, Josef Schmitz" Josef Schmitz My son! That I can read things like that in the paper about you! Mom! It's... It's possible that I'll have to go on a trip soon. Maybe all of a sudden and... for a long time. But why? Why is that? Where do you want to go? That's still undetermined but... Once I'm gone if you need anything important... Everything is in that drawer over there. I think from now on you'll have one less customer. Why? -You'll figure it out! Criminal Investigation Dept. Is Josef Schmidtz home? Yes. What do you want from him? Where is he? Josef, there are two gentlemen here who want to talk to you. I don't know. He was just here. Josef! Freeze or I'll shoot! Damn, too late! Sextuple Murderer of Women: 5000 DM REWARD! Josef Schmitz of Essen. That's a nice horsey, Uncle Schmitz! -Yes, my child. Cheers, Mr. Schmitz -Cheers! Uh, there you are! Evchen! This is Mr. Schmitz, he's the one who saved Evchen! We're just celebrating. For that you could have put up a new table cloth. I don't have to tell you how a mother feels. What? You brought this old cake in? I mean for Mr. Schmitz saving our Evchen... Mrs Mucke, please... That was self-evident. Look Mommy, this nice horsey! Oh, that's nice! But Evchen, you broke the nice chain. Uh, that doesn't matter. Evchen, you can keep this. Thank you. -That's nice, isn't it? Um, I'm still all nervous, I just came out of the city. They finally know who the guy is that killed all those women. Thank you. Supposedly all the roads are closed off. The reward is 5000 Marks now. -Hopefully they'll catch me soon! Attention! You're listening to a police announcement. Now listen! We're looking for the sextuple murderer, whose name is finally known. It's the 32 yr old commercial agent Josef Schmitz The fugitive is wearing a grey sports jacket, grey pants, and a dark red tie. One noticeable characteristic is his white blonde hair. The police started a manhunt and ask for the public's support. We'll be back in two minutes with the stock market report. So it's you! Yes! Come, Evchen, let's go to the playschool. Goodbye Uncle. -Go play and take your ball with you. You will ask me now... How I could do something like that. No. No, I don't want to know that... -But, I want to tell someone! A... A woman... is responsible for it. A blonde. She was the first woman in my life. But she... She cheated on me the whole time. And she laughed at me. She laughed at me at a time when no woman is allowed to laugh. And since then I made sure that... no blonde would laugh at me again. Leave! You saved my child's life, that's why... That's why we won't report you, but leave now! No! I can't do that! They're waiting for me everywhere! I need a couple of days. We don't want to be involved in this. I saved your child's life! You said it yourself! That's how I got into the papers. It's how I was recognized! You shouldn't do any good, it's not worth it. You swore eternal gratitude to me. Now, I come to make use of it! You have to hide me for three days so I can escape more easily. How am I supposed to do that? -You will find a way, Mr. Mucke. I see! And now we can look for him. Three times I had him in my office! But they all thought they knew better. Thing is: he did a good deed and someone is thankful for that. I mean, it's a child's life! If someone like that is being cornered... Prize question: Where would we go? He'll try to abuse the gratitude. The great saviour will say: "Do something for me as well" Give me another schnapps. You became so quiet all of a sudden. Good day, Uncle Dennert! Evchen, you little cutie. Come here to Uncle Dennert. Look what I have here. -That's a horse. A horsey. Who gave you that? -The Uncle. Which Uncle? The Uncle who saved you? Yeah. -When did he give it to you? Just now. Uh, can you lend me that for a second? You're not playing with me. -Uh, you'll get it back. Then we'll play together. -Don't forget. Dennert Two, please. Yes! It's your father, the old schmoe! Never mind! I can tell you where Mr. Schmitz is, the man you're looking for. Thank you, father. Schmitz is in Friedrichstrasse 9. Close off the whole block. This time they must not escape! This is the back side! From here he could only go this way. Close everything off! Good day. -Thank you, father. Is he still in there? -Where is he now? I am a...what did you say? An old geezer. Stop! Freeze! Freeze or I'll shoot! Stop! Stop! -Stay back! Get down! Quiet in that corner! Keep your mouth shut! Move it! If you shoot, I'll blow myself up! And with the children! No! Not the children! Uh no?! What?! A child brought me into this situation. And now you can all die for all I care! Damn! We have to get in a different way. Please let me through! Father, one moment please! Father, what am I supposed to do? I can't endanger the children. Go in through the back door. Take Mucke with you. I'll keep him busy out front. -Good. If I get to go down, then... I'll take as many of you with me as I can! Stop! Freeze! I don't have a weapon! I want to negotiate with you. I want to help you. Stop, I said! I can't scream like that. Let me come closer. All right! All right, five steps! But then stop! Schmitz! Gosh! You know you can't get out of here anymore! Alive, Dennert... You won't take me alive! If he hears something it's over. Schmitz! Be reasonable and listen to me carefully. It's best for you if you're reasonable! Schmitz! You're more attached to your mother than anything. Yes. What do you want? You thought you took care of your mom with the insurance. That's a mistake! If you kill yourself, it's suicide and your mother won't get a penny. And the 12,000 Marks you paid in cash... That'll be confiscated anyway! Because its from the hold-up. But if you come out willing, maybe we can do something for her. I'm telling you for the last time. Be reasonable, Schmitz! Otherwise, you'll have to take credit for everything yourself. There's a very high reward for you, Schmitz! No policeman is allowed to accept the reward. But me, I'm a private person! And if you come out now... then I'm eligible for the reward. And I'll give that to your mother. It's a trick! You want to trick me. Think about it, Schmitz! It's your only chance! -Don't move, Dennert! Father! Where did you get all these vases from? I feel like a mother who just had her first child. The Chief of Police and the Mayor called! They want to come by tomorrow afternoon. We have to get garlands and a red carpet for them. And don't forget the brass band! Hello father! I heard the doctor is happy with you. -But he should let me get up! You'd like that. Here's some letters. -Uh, put it with the rest. There's so many I'll be responding for the rest of my life! You won't have time for that! Hagen and Mollers A.G asked if you wanted to be their private detective. Private detective? But the Chief of Police wants to make you an offer as well. You could be an FSU. For Special Use at the police? Come on! Sit down here! What's with your Ursula? -Have a guess! We want to marry. -How's that? And what's with the testimony from this guy? This Goede? He retracted his statement. So don't worry about having a convict as daughter-in-law. Bugger! Mr. Dennert! -What's the matter now? A visitor for you! Good day, Dennert! -Hey Mucke! I have my rheumatism today, so I better come through the door. My wife says hello! -That's nice of you both! Put that over there, please. You have a black eye again. Hopeless! Yeah and I should give you something. When you were visiting Schmitz... -What is it? This was tantalizingly lying around. -I don't know how it happened. But my wife says... -Dennert two! Take that. This won't be recorded! - Uh- thank you! And you have to promise me, that's your last relapse! Definitely, Mr. Dennert. -Alright, let's celebrate! Reach under the pillow! Uh, empty! -Uh no, the next one! That is really quite something! But I won't drink, I am working! You fool! You'll never be your father's son! Lena! Lena should bring a couple of glasses! Lena, bring a couple of... Uh, girl -I'll go get the glasses! Uh, thank you. SAVINGS SOCIETY Carefree Harry and I have our difficulties. Maybe I really am a little old-fashioned. But you two should make sure that a new "Copper" is born. This way the whole problem would be solved. It can't be that difficult. With my nose. And with your head. And with your heart. Something great has to come out of it! But you don't have to hurry, right, Hansilein? The old Copper will keep on doing this for a little while. Did you hear that? These young people! They don't even listen! Cheers to my grandchild! The "new" Copper!
