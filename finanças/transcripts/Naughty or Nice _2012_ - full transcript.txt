No, don't put me on hold. How... You're the third person I've spoken to. Today, by the way. I have water. I don't have hot water, do you understand there's a difference? Can you get me some sugar, honey? - Okay, great. - Thank you. Then help me, please. I had icicles in my hair this morning. Do you know what that's like? No... Oh! Oh! Oh! - Oh, hey, are you okay? - Yeah. - I'm sorry. Come on. - Daniel! Tomorrow, please. Thank you. Oh. - I'm so sorry. - It's... Apologize to this nice lady. Boys will be boys. It's fine, really. No, it's not. Daniel, say you're sorry. Now. Or do you wanna end up on the naughty list? I'm sorry I ran into you. That naughty or nice list really works, huh? - What's she talking about? - Nothing, honey. I'll be right back. I'm guessing by your lack of stains, sweatpants, and bloodshot eyes, you don't have children. No, I don't. You probably popped right up after eight hours of sleep, took a nice, long, hot shower... Actually, no. My hot water heater's all... Leisurely got dressed, applied your perfect makeup while watching Good Morning America. - That is so not my life. - I love my children, but parenting is all your nightmares combined. The one trump card parents have is that kids know Santa keeps a list. So, yes, the naughty or nice list still works. The world is a better place because of it. What? Enjoy. Next. Hi, can I get a large vanilla latte with a shot... Make it three shots of espresso, and a mocha capp to go? - Okay. - Thank you. $7.75, please. Thanks. [chuckles] - Seriously? - Seriously. Krissy Kringle? Like Kris Kringle? [laughs] That's awesome. You want some milk and cookies to go with your latte? I can get you some carrot sticks for your reindeer. Do you think any of that is original? [swipes card] [beep] Sorry, St. Nick. Credit card's been declined. - Seriously? - Seriously. Well, I don't have cash. Here's... Ah. I need another quarter. Come on. Thanks, kid. You're off the naughty list. [cash register opens] - [Krissy] Morning, Michaela. - Morning. - [Krissy] Hey, Jack. - Hey. - [Krissy] Hello. - Hi. Hi. Everybody's a comedian. Hey, there. Hi. The usual. Ah, thank you. You're a lifesaver. You look nice. Oh. Meeting a friend for lunch. Does that say, "triple shot"? - Hmm? Mm. - Rough night? Rough morning. Jingle, jingle, Miss Krissy Kringle. And it continues. She's heard them all, Philip. Run along, now. Helen needs to see you in her office ASAP. Get your sleigh bells over there. - Thank you, Philip. Bye-bye. - Okay. Oh, how do I look? Like promotion material? I don't have any hot water at my house, so I'm a mess. You look great. You really think you're gonna get it? I don't know. I mean, I've brought in three new accounts in the last month, and the rumor is they're gonna hire from within. And two days ago, Helen smiled at me in the bathroom. No teeth, but the corners of her mouth did go up. Go get it, girl. [Krissy sighs] [tense music plays] [tapping keys] [exhales] Miss Kringle. Yes. We're setting you free today. You can pick up your final check from accounting. Thank you so much for your work. Have a good holiday. [tapping keys] I'm sorry, did you just fire me? We released you, yes. Released me. Like an animal into the wild. Why? Cutbacks. - Cutbacks? - That's it. Because I have been bringing in new clients every month. I thought I was getting a promotion. Oh. No. No, you know what? You just... You can't... You... You... You should know that... You are going on the naughty list. [scoffs] - Fired? - Released. Returning me to my natural habitat. Unemployed and going nowhere. I thought this was it, you know? I thought this was a place I was gonna make a name for myself. I'm clever-ish and funny and smart, right? Don't say anything if you don't agree. I agree. God, and right before Christmas. I knew her heart was made of ice, but this is really cold. I know. Well... I let her have it. Oh, my God. Tell me what you said. Told her she was rude and oblivious and just angry. And then I said a bunch of stuff I can't even repeat. You did not. What I actually said was more like, "You're gonna end up on Santa's naughty list." [chuckles] "Naughty" what? She's intimidating, and I'm weak. I'm gonna die in the wild. Maybe you should go back in and give her a time-out as well. Ha. You know what? They take all our best ideas, we never get a raise or a bonus, and nobody gets promoted. Maybe this is a good thing. I mean, what am I supposed to do? I literally had to borrow change from a seven-year-old today. Lance is making money. I mean, he's almost a partner by now, right? Yeah. Yeah, but I'm not gonna take money from him until we're married. It's been six years. I mean, how long should a girl have to wait? Apparently six years. Ah, Jill, my mom's gonna freak out. I mean, now I'm unmarried and unemployed. I know this seems terrible right now, Krissy. You'll land on your feet. Give me a call, and we'll grab drinks or something. Thanks, Jill. [sad music plays] [slow Christmas music plays] [Krissy sighs] I know, terrible. [Krissy puffs] [Krissy grunts] [grunts] Whoop! [mysterious music plays] Hmm. That's weird. [girl] Dear Santa, thank you for visiting me in the hospital. You forgot this. I know it's important for your job. Merry Christmas. Your friend, Katie. Okay. [knocking on the door] Hi, sweetheart. Hi. Sorry about your job. I tried to get out earlier. Mm, it's okay. I just didn't wanna go to Mom and Dad's for dinner by myself. I can hear the lecture already. Don't tell them. [laughs] You know nothing gets past her. - She's like a mind reader. - Yeah. Just go with the don't ask, don't tell policy and hope she's having an off night. Yeah. We make it to dessert without any mention of your job, you'll be home free. [Krissy chuckles] [Lance chuckles] [magical music plays] Wow. Hologram reindeer. Debbie's really going all out this year for the title. That's impressive. She's not taking any chances. She tried to get real reindeer. Apparently, they require a permit. You know, Miss Kringle, you should really get into the spirit. I'm getting a wreath. - A wreath. - A wreath. You're a Kringle. Be better than a wreath. Stop it. Everyone thinks I work with elves. It's horrible. I'm just saying... It fits my mood. - Oh, poor baby. - [Krissy chuckles] [Christmas music plays] Hello! Mom? Dad? - Ho... - Ho! Ho! - Oh, kill me now. - Just get to dessert. - Hey. - Hi, Daddy. - Hi, darling. - Hi, Mama. How are you? - Ah, pumpkin, I presume. - Mm. Carol, I love your sweater. Is it new? Oh, thanks. I made it myself. I made one for Krissy too, but she hasn't worn it yet. Oh, come on, come on. Food's ready. Yeah, yeah, come. You guys just wanna start with dessert? [chuckles] [both chuckle] [Lance] Thank you, Carol. Thanks, Mom. That was wonderful. Thank your dad. He did most of the cooking. And now the reason we have a main course in the first place. - No sugar. - It's the holidays. Every day is a holiday to you. Well, what do you expect? I'm a Kringle. See, that wasn't so bad. - We're almost there. - You're almost there. Portion control. Your portion control would starve a mouse. [sighs] - Here. - Thank you. I assume the other one didn't fit, so this one's a little looser. - Try it on. - Yay, bigger. I'll try it on at home. In private. I really wish you'd get into the Christmas spirit, sweetheart. Of course you do. It's why you named me Krissy Kringle. Oh, come on, now. Everyone always thinks that's adorable. - Daily. - You were named after a legend. Mother Teresa is a legend. We could be actual descendants, for all you know. Yeah, don't be such a sourpuss. You're the one who chose to live on Candy Cane Lane. No, no, no, they voted to change the name to Candy Cane Lane after I moved in because of this holiday house contest. Now every December, I can't even open my front door. You know, I think it's so sweet that kids still mail their letters to Santa Claus. Sure, it's adorable. Except all those letters end up at my house. Well, you could always sell the place. I can't, I'm totally upside-down like everything else in my life. What's the matter? Hmm? Nothing. You got fired. What? How does she do that? - It's a gift. - It's a curse. Wait, wait, wait. I thought you were getting a promotion. You've been talking about this for weeks. - [Carol] Yeah, what happened? - I don't even know. She said it was cutbacks. But that doesn't make any sense 'cause there's still a position open. Gosh, just before Christmas. What are you gonna do for a job? I don't know. I mean, look, I'll figure it out. It's fine. Let's just talk about something else. I'm gonna help her out till she gets on her feet. You are not gonna help me out. I am an independent woman, I can handle myself. You know, this really wouldn't be an issue - if you two were married. - Mom. Really? Well, you know, I would like to plan my daughter's wedding. Is that so wrong? It is not 1950. Women have other priorities than getting married. It will happen when it happens. Hmm. And I am not going to take "no" for an answer. No. Okay. [Krissy chuckles] Where is she going? She won't take "no" for an answer. I promise you. Now, look. Your independence is not gonna pay the mortgage or buy gas or... or... or put food on the table. You should've never bought that house. Wait, you are the one that told me to buy that house. You said, "Krissy, now is the time to buy," and she is the mind reader in the family. How come she didn't predict the crash? Well, she does... Doesn't see everything. Shh. You said if we got to the pie, we'd be home free. - We should have skipped dessert. - Mm. Okay. What is this now? [Carol] That is your next job. It's only temporary, but it'll do till something better comes along. Wrapping presents at the mall. - I'm not doing this. - [Carol] It's too late. I already texted Gloria. Her grandson is the manager. I told him you would be there at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. Mom! Hey, come on, it's the perfect job for a Kringle. Okay, you understand in other countries, they force prisoners to wrap presents. It's a form of torture. No! Don't be so dramatic. I'm sure that Lance agrees with me, don't you, honey? Don't. [chuckles] And you get to wear a cute little elf costume. Oh, that is definitely not happening. I think elves earn an extra 20 bucks a day. Seriously? Huh. Do you wanna come inside and watch an old movie or something? [Lance sighs] I can't. I have a pile of research. Big deposition tomorrow. Sure. It's okay, it's fine. Don't be mad. I'm an associate. It won't be like this forever, I promise. So why were you so quiet when my mom asked about us getting married? [Lance] So that's really why you're upset. Because I didn't jump up and tell your mom that she has a wedding to plan. Your silence was deafening. I don't talk about weddings, Krissy, because you hate them. - What? - You... The overcooked steak, the Chicken Dance, that Shout song. Everybody hates that stuff! My wedding's not gonna be like that. It is gonna be different, okay? Most girls wanna get married so they can have their own personal prom. I just... Ugh, I just want a new last name. So you're using me. Well, yeah. [chuckles] I love you, Krissy Kringle. Come here. I need you to. Good night. Debbie? Wh... What are you doing? Um, just some last-minute decorating. Oh... Candy canes. It's not really your theme this year. Yeah, I know, right? No, these won't... These won't work at all. You know... A porch light doesn't count as a decoration. It's a shame that someone with such a festive last name is such a grinch. This is Candy Cane Lane. Show some respect! It was not Candy Cane Lane when I moved in, okay? You are the nightmare before Christmas, Krissy Kringle! Yes, you are. [sighs] [shower running] [Krissy] Oh! Oh. [shower running] Oh, cold. Oh. Oh! [mysterious music plays] [playful music plays] Aw. [cell phone rings] Hello? [plumber] Yeah, this is the plumber. This Krissy Kringle? This is she. [plumber] That's your real name? Yes. [plumber] Krissy Kringle. Candy Cane Lane. Yes, Krissy Kringle, who lives on Candy Cane Lane. [rustling] [plumber] Ma'am, you there? Oh. Oh! Oh. [tinkling] Oh. Oh. "Loses patience with plumber"? [tinkling] "Opens other people's mail." Hmm. Krissy Kringle. [tinkling] [pants] [cell phone rings] - Hello? - [plumber] Hello. Miss Kringle? Who is this? Dean Patterson, Patterson Plumbing. We were cut off. Dean Patterson, right. I'm sorry. [plumber] Yeah, look, uh, Miss Kringle, I'm... I'm sorry, but my truck broke down. I'm not gonna be able to fix that water heater today. [Krissy] "Lies to customer about truck breaking down." [plumber] What? What was that? Are you in your pajamas, drinking coffee? [plumber] What? What are you talking about? - Plaid pajamas? - [plumber] No. I'm serious. I'm sitting here waiting for a tow right now. - You're lying. - [plumber] No. No, I'm not. Yes. Yes, you are. You're on your couch, aren't you? Admit it. [plumber] Okay, okay, I'm sorry. I had a late night, I'm going through some stuff. - I'll be... I'll be there. - Okay. Okay. The water heater's out back. - And don't overcharge me. - [plumber] I won't. I won't. Or I'll know. [upbeat Christmas music plays] [man with Australian accent] Yeah, that's it. All right, you take point. You gotta slay the minotaur first, then we get to the wizard. Hi. [video game sounds] Oh, now I'm surrounded. Hi. I'm Krissy. Joe, Chen, hold on. You're 15 minutes late. I know, I'm sorry. It was, um... It was a strange morning. I mean, like, beyond strange. I'm just... I'm in a bit of a fog today. Well, Grams said you're gonna be an elf. Yeah. Is your last name really Kringle? Yup. Well, then you've found your calling, mate. [chuckles] Put this on, and meet me in Santa's workshop. Oh, wow. Where is that, exactly? There's signs everywhere. [clatter] Are you... Um... - Okay... - God! [chuckles] What, you think I like all these extra decorations in my office? Is there no place else to put all this junk in the entire mall? I'm the only one that's gotta walk through this minefield because, hey, Justin won't care, will he? Well, I do care. For goo... [grunts] [clatter] [train whistle blowing] Hey. ["We Wish You A Merry Christmas" playing] Hey. Come on, come on. Pick it up. Marco, meet Krissy Kringle. Wow. You got a stage name and everything. It's my real name. Sorry, I thought you were kidding. Well, welcome to the fun factory. Hey, keep it cheery, mate. Or I'll make you wear the hat. All right, Marco will show you the ropes. For now, start wrapping. Let's go. What's his story? Well, to start with, he speaks with an Australian accent, yet he is not Australian. - Shall I go on? - What? Yes, please. Yeah, rumor has it he watches Crocodile Dundee every night and then on weekends goes on walkabout. - Amazing. - Yeah. Name a complex, he's got it. So how come the ladies don't have to wear elf costumes? That is a fair question. The blue hairs work at the senior center, so they don't get to be as fashionable as we are. Hey, Ruth. Hey, Phyllis. How's it going? They can't hear me. Uh, oh, did he tell you that the elves have to work at Santa's photo gallery as well? - What? - Yup. Put on a happy face. You're gonna need it. No, no, I'm not trained to work the photo gallery. Oh. Okay, well, question. Do you know what this word means? - Yeah. - Great. And... Can you do this? - Mm-hmm. - Okay, wait for it. And then back again. Got it. Guess what. You just got trained. [laughs] Merry Christmas. Got another load for the elves. What? I thought it was break time. You were 15 minutes late. That was your break. Another hour and a half till lunch. What is this, Santa's workshop or Santa's sweatshop? You know what? Let's get out of here. He's gonna be trying to level up for the next hour. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Honestly, I thought my old boss was bad. I went from Helen of Troy to a Napoleonic elf. - Who's also a liar and a cheat. - What are you talking about? All right, well, the wrapping station is sponsored by the senior center. Uh-huh. Justin's grandma is the chairwoman, so that's how he got his job. Well, I figured it wasn't based on merit. Okay, but they used to give a petty cash fund for the managers to buy snacks and drinks for the staff. - That's sweet. - Right? - So where are the snacks? - Exactly. Ever since Justin took over, he's like, "Oh, sorry, mate. We stopped doing it. You know how it is." He throws around the word "recession" like he knows what it means. So you're saying he's stealing. I think so. But I can't prove it, so what is an elf to do? I got bills to pay just like everybody else. Don't wanna go rocking the sleigh. ["Jingle Bells" playing] Stop it. Stop. [gasps] Ow! A kitten hugging a puppy? That's hilarious, Ruth. And, Phyllis, I heard you took second place at the gin rummy tournament last weekend. Congratulations. That's fantastic. Ugh. Excuse me, ladies. One second. Are you kidding me? I've seen five-year-olds wrap better. Let me explain. Right, you fold it straight... One piece of tape. You use more than one piece of tape, you're doing it wrong. Keep doing it wrong, and you're fired. Understand? Or should I speak slower? Good. Keep up the Christmas cheer. [Marco sighs] Hat on! [sighs] I'll be right back. Where are you going? Krissy! Justin Reid. [tinkling] "Plays video games at work." [tinkling] "Sleeps at his desk." [tinkling] Check... mate. [video game sounds] Please go back to the workshop. Okay. Hey, um, sorry. Is this about that thing that I told you about? 'Cause that's just between you and me. - It's okay. Where's the money? - Oh. - What is this, a shakedown? - Just... The petty cash from the senior center. I told you, cutbacks and recession. Oh. You're sure about that? Wait, what... [Krissy gasps] Justin. You thief! What would Grams think, Justin? [without an accent] Don't tell Grams. If she finds out, she'll cut me off. Please. I'll do whatever you want. It's okay, we're not gonna say anything on three conditions. One, you are gonna buy the staff snacks. And lunch for the rest of the week. Yeah, and that means actual food. Something that's not gonna make us diabetic. Two... Show some respect. Stop demeaning everyone. I do that? - A lot. - [Krissy] Three... You're gonna let me borrow all these extra holiday decorations. You're gonna take all of this stuff out of here? No, no, mate. You are. My address is right here. Forget that. I mean, it's cool. We can call Grams. Yeah, we could totally call Grams. She's really good friends with my mom. No, no, no, fine. Fine. You win. Uh, Marco, order lunch for everyone. With pleasure. Oh. There you go. That's better. [sighs] That was sick! It really was fun watching him grovel. How did you know where the money would be? Are you psychic or something? No, no, I had some help. Well, tell me about it over lunch. Oh, I have to meet my boyfriend. He's, um... where's... He's actually not gonna make it. - Oh. - Figures. Hey, it's all right, look, you know what'll never stand you up? A sandwich, my treat. Come on. Ah, I still can't believe you called him out like that. And blackmailed him. You should consider politics. We'll see how my yard turns out, right? Yeah, right? Uh, I need a Turkey, no Mayo, on wheat. I'll get a veggie wrap, gluten free. Excuse me, you guys not go to kindergarten? Don't know how a line works? - We were next. - Oh, no! We're not gonna get anything in our stockings this year. Wait, so you actually walk around in public like that? Aren't you taking the whole holiday spirit a little too far? Hmm, aren't you taking your makeup a little bit too... Psst. Save our spots. I'll be right back. I have to get a picture of this. - Putting this one on Facebook. - [Marco] Okay, stop. Stop. No, stop. [tinkling] - [Tiffany] Smile. - [Marco] No. Okay, that's... Do... Do not tag me. [cell phone camera clicks] [Tiffany] It's for Twitter. Hi, Tiffany, Brittany. A little holiday spirit for you guys. Brittany, stop telling everyone Tiffany's bulimic. She's not. - And, Tiffany... - What? Stop texting Brittany's boyfriend she's cheating on him. That's rude. Why would you do that? I would never do something like that. I can't believe you told people I was bulimic. - You know I'm not anymore. - I didn't say that! Happy holidays! It may have slipped out a long time ago. What do you mean, "slipped out"? Things don't slip out. Okay, what is going on here, all right? Are you... Are you like a witch or something? It's a gift. Hi. We're next. Spill it. Don't tell me it's a gift. I wrap gifts. This is not a gift, all right? This is like voodoo or something. You're gonna think I'm insane. Don't make me use drastic measures. I don't even know what it is for sure. All right, don't think that I haven't learned some tactics from these kids, all right? I have seen moms break in seconds. - I can break you! - Fine. I will tell you. But you are the only person, do you understand? 'Cause if anybody else finds out, I will end up in the loony bin. Okay, I'm like Fort Knox, I promise. [man] Number seven, please. [bell rings] What is this, your book of spells? Sort of. Can I ask you an honest and direct question? As opposed to a deceitful and ambiguous one? Proceed. - That's funny. - Thank you. Do you think there is a real naughty or nice list? The naughty or nice list. Every year, because of my name and the street I live on, I get thousands of letters intended for the real Kris Kringle. Right. I'm sorry, back it up. The real Kris Kringle? Santa Claus. Yes, I got the connection. So just for argument's sake, let's say he really is watching us, and he really does know whether or not we've been naughty or nice. - I know how it sounds. - Do you? Good. No, hey, sounds perfectly reasonable. Look, I do believe that somebody is watching over us and all that, but not Santa Claus, 'cause I was raised catholic. Can you just go with me here? [laughing] I'm trying. What if there is a little bit of magic this time of year? And what if the list is real, and it's not just this thing that parents use to threaten their kids to behave? And what if it was accidentally sent to me? Those are a lot of "what ifs." And you thought I wouldn't put you in the loony bin? - Okay. - Check this out. All right. Marco Webb. [tinkling] "Told girlfriend he was sick, then went to a sports bar"? How does it know that? Shh, sit down. And that... That is private. How... So crazy, but this might be the real naughty or nice list. Who else would have a book like this? The CIA. 'Cause they care that you lied to your girlfriend. Hey, I am a pretty important guy, so maybe. All right, this just appeared on your doorstep? - Yeah. - And have... Have you told anybody else? No, I don't want anyone... You know, let's make that two, to go. - [Marco] What's the matter? - Oh, God. It's my old boss and Jill. - [man] That'll be $5.50. - Okay, thank you. Which one is Jill? Is she foxy blue, or the ice queen? Shh! Just tell me when they're gone. Okay. - Thank you. - Let's go. [gasps] Oh, and she's looking at me. Are they gone? And we're clear. What was that about? "Foxy blue" is Jill. I worked with her at my old job at an advertising agency. Wow, you went from ad exec to elf. That is a letdown. I got fired, and now Jill is coffee buddies with the boss. Something's not right about that. Whoa, whoa. What are you doing? You can't just wield that thing. Jill Rhodes. Or maybe you can. [tinkling] "Stole promotion from Krissy Kringle." [man] Number eight, please. That backstabbing... [bell rings] All right, let's wrap this up before you go all Vesuvius on us and cover us in ash. Can we take these to go? Jill was my mentor. And, I mean, I thought she was my friend. What do I know? You two ever go shopping together? No. Not a friend. You know what? You're right. She wasn't my friend, she stole my ideas, she passed them off as her own, she told Helen I was hitting on her husband. That's insane. He's, like, 50. Wait, so you knew him, then. Yeah, we talked about reality television at company parties. Well, that can get passionate. Especially if they're about any of the Real Housewives. [chuckles] She betrayed me. I'm gonna go in there on Monday and just tell them everything. Tell them what, exactly? That you found Santa's naughty or nice list? They'll have you committed. And then what happens to the book if she gets her hands on it? Well, I can't just let her get away with it. That's fine, but we gotta be methodical about this. All right, now, probably got a line of kids waiting to see Santa. Let's deal with that, then we'll get back to "Operation Kill Jill" later. All right? Let's go. Let's go. And we'll go. [soft Christmas music plays] Unbelievable. [chuckles] Oh, gold star, Justin. Debbie. Hi. What do you think? Compliments the porch light, huh? [Debbie] Very nice. I love this little family of snowmen! They're so cute! Do you think I have a chance of winning the holiday house contest? Well, it's nice not to have a black hole on the street. I'm sure that's worth some merit. Hmm. I don't know, I think I've got a real shot. When do we vote? Check your newsletter. Huh. Excellent. [Lance] You've reached Lance Leigh. Leave me a message. [beep] Hey, Mr. Attorney. I got your flowers. Thank you. You're off the hook this time. But call me, okay? There's, um, some crazy stuff going on. I just wanna talk to you about it. I think. [sighs] - [sighs] - [Jill] Hi, this is Jill. Leave me a message if you dare. I'll call you back if I care. [Jill chuckles] [beep] Hey, Jill, it's Krissy, your great, great friend. Um, just wanting to get those drinks that we talked about. So call me back. I can't wait. Bye. [mysterious music plays] Debbie O'Brien. [tinkling] That little weasel. Excellent. [neighbors talking indistinctively] Hey. Wow! What is this winter wonderland? This is unbelievable. - I know, right? - Justin really did a good job. That Grams must be a real gravy train. Well, I just hope it's enough to beat my neighbor Debbie over here. I'm calling out that kleptomaniac tonight. All right. Thank you for coming, by the way. Ah, please. This is better than shark week. [both chuckle] This is quite the turnout. [Krissy] We're entering the lion's den. Ooh, maybe they got cake pops. I'll be right back. Marco. Krissy! I love what you did to your house. Oh. Everyone is talking about how beautiful it is. I posted it on Pinterest, and so far it has gotten over 2,000 repins! - Wow. - It's a sensation! Oh, yeah, thank you. Okay, let's everyone take our seats. The meeting is about to begin. Thank you. They've got mini cupcakes. Don't leave me alone with these people again. [laughs] [bells jingle] - [Marco] What does that mean? - [Krissy] I do not know. Take your seats, everyone. Welcome. Welcome, Candy Cane Lane neighbors. As you know, tonight we are going to select the best holiday house. But I think, with the huge turnout of spectators that we've had every evening that it is safe to say that we are all winners. [applause] [Krissy clears her throat] [whistles] Debbie. Krissy has a question. Oh. Krissy, I apologize. You never come to these things. You can imagine why I might overlook you. Oh, I just... I didn't get a chance to cast my ballot. Oh, that's unfortunate. The ballot box was right over there by the dessert table. Oh, well. That's why punctuality is the politeness of kings. Oh, come on, Debbie. - Just let her vote. - Yeah. It's so nice to have her join in this year. [applause] Let her vote! Come on! - Come on! - Thank you, guys. All right, okay. It is Christmas. Please, bring your ballot to my assistant. By the way, you can't vote for yourself. Yes, Debbie. I'm well aware. Okay. This is so exciting, right? Ahh! Do we have the results? Here we go. Second runner-up, winner of a 60-piece Tupperware set... Sixty. With four votes, Brenda and David Weir. That's great. We won. There's your Tupperware. [Brenda chuckles] Fantastic. [Brenda chuckles] [mild applause] You are gonna keep a lot of things fresh. And now the first runner-up, and the winner of a one-year membership to the cheese of the month club... Yum. [chuckles] Oh. With seven votes, Krissy Kringle. Hey! [applause] Huh. Huh, all right. - Whoo! - Congratulations, Krissy. You see what happens when you participate? You win nice things. Noted. Okay, okay, okay. And here's the moment that we've all been waiting for. The winner. Oh, my goodness! It's me! Oh! With eight votes, Debbie O'Brien. Thank you. Thank you all so much. It's such an honor. Hey, hey, let's give ourselves a round of applause, huh? 'Cause when Debbie wins, we all win, don't we? [applause] Thank you, Krissy. Now, I don't wanna put a damper on the festivities, but I do have to raise just a small, little concern. I'm actually missing some key pieces from my display. Does anybody know anything about that? Well, kids like to play pranks this time of year. - Oh. - No, no, no, she has a point. I had a bunch of my candy canes go missing. Brenda, it is so funny you would say that. I saw Debbie with an armful of candy canes just a few nights ago, walking across her lawn. Krissy. Is anybody else missing anything? One of my wise men and a camel are MIA. Yeah, and my North Pole gnomes have... psh... vanished. [Krissy] How about that? Now, look, I don't wanna jump to any conclusions, but my gut is telling me if we take a peek in Debbie's shed, we could probably solve this mystery. Wha... What? To the backyard! - [Debbie] No, no! No, no, no! - [Brenda] Everybody, follow me! - Oh, this is crazy. - No, no, no! No, no, everyone sit down. What are you doing? This is crazy! This is crazy! Go, go! Come on! [Debbie] This is ridiculous! Come back here! [Brenda] This way! [Debbie] What are you doing? [man] Definitely been missing. [Brenda] Get ready, everybody! Open the doors! [all gasp] [man] Oh, my gosh! Holy Moly! No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait! It's not what you think. I... I was gonna give it all back. Under the circumstances, I propose we revote for the best holiday house. - Yeah, I agree. - Wha... All in favor of my house, please raise your hands. - She did a good job. - Yeah. All in favor of Krissy's house, please raise your hands. - Yeah. - Whoo! - Great this year. - Come on! Finally, Debbie's house. [Brenda] Yeah, I didn't think so. Looks like you lost your title. Congratulations, Krissy! Whoo! [applause] Debbie, you've disgraced yourself. I am taking my candy canes and my Tupperware back. That I won, fair and square. - Congratulations, Krissy. - Oh, thanks. [man] See my wise man in there anywhere? - I'm sorry. - Thank you. [man] Honey, grab that. Grab that. That's ours. - That's our... That's ours. - [man 2] No, there's two. There's two of them. [sad music plays] Well, that was my first Christmas lynch mob. Hmm. I kept waiting for somebody to yell, "kill the beast!" What? Oh, don't tell me you feel sorry for her, do you? I didn't have to humiliate her. Ah, she humiliated herself. - Great. - Oh, don't tell me. Lance is working late again. It's none of my business, but why do you keep putting up with that? It's not his fault. He's trying to make partner. He's just trying to make a good impression. It's just sometimes I wish he'd try to make a good impression on me. So what's his deal? He doesn't wanna get married until his career is where he wants it. He says he's getting a good bonus this year. Like I care about that. So do you ever think about, you know, using the list? Like, to give you peace of mind. If I do that, that's like reading his emails. Where's the trust? Look, if it were me, I'd wanna know. I'm just saying. I'm just saying. Okay. Good night. [sighs] [sighs] Lance Leigh. [pages rustle] [tinkling] [gasps] [gasps] Oh. [tense music plays] Hi, um, I'm looking for, uh... He's a guy. He's here with... Found him. He lives! Krissy. Is everything okay? It was. Till I found out you are lying, cheating scum of the earth. Excuse us. You know what? They need to know your true colors. Especially you, Mrs. Harris. If you're considering making him partner, you should know his true colors, right? - Krissy, stop it. - [Krissy] I trusted you. For six years, I gave you everything, and this is how you repay me? By lying to me and cheating on me? What are you talking about? All those "late nights" you were working, you were really with Jill, weren't you? Guilty or not? Okay, that is not what you think. I knew it! You just admitted it. It's guilty! Krissy, my boss is here. I know. Ms. Harris, you're a lady. I'm sure you understand, right? [Ms. Harris] Oh! [man] Are you kidding me? [sighs] Excuse me. [Marco] Big smile. That's a great one. There you... Oh, even better. There you go. All right, what's a mouse eat? That's right. Cheese. Okay, all right. One more, just for you. Excellent. All right, good job. Merry Christmas. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, no. Up, now. That's not how we do things here. Did you hear me say "next"? - I wanna see Santa. - All right, great. You're gonna see Santa when it's your turn. What's the difference? That Santa's fake, and you're too big to be an elf. This is lame! Excuse me? I want you to know something. Santa's helpers come in all shapes and sizes. And some of us are just trying to make a living, okay? Whatever, lady. No, not "whatever." I want you to know something. Santa has eyes everywhere, and nothing, I mean nothing, goes unnoticed. Do you understand? Krissy. It's fine. I got it. He is watching and recording every naughty thing you do. And trust me, in your case, it is a huge collection. You're crazy. - I'm crazy? - [kids laugh] Oh, that's funny, huh? All right. You think you can just lie and cheat and not be held accountable? You're so wrong! Because Santa knows all! He's got a list. And one day, you're gonna wake up and think, "Oh, I'm gonna get this great present for Christmas!" But instead, you are gonna be single and unemployed and too weak and intimidated to do anything about it! Okay, all right! All right. Here we go. Her blood sugar's way down. Where are your parents? Come on, now. All right. What was that? I don't know, I don't know. Oh, God, Marco, I'm sorry. I lost it. Yeah! That's a bit of an understatement. What happened? I checked on Lance in the book. He cheated on me with Jill. Yeah. I guess I would've lost it too. Um... Maybe not in front of Santa. It started earlier in the day. At Lance's business lunch. It was stupid. It was so stupid. I know that. But I was just... I was hurt, and I was furious. Lance isn't that guy. It's not like him. I wish I'd never opened the book. [sad song plays] And initial. Thank you. [sighs] [reporter] We'll bring youmore on the story as it unfolds. Everyone's a little disappointed by the lack of snow on the mountains this year, but maybe now we know why it hasn't been a white Christmas. Things got pretty heated today when one of Santa's helpers had a meltdown at the mall. Shoppers captured this footage that went viral earlier today. Not be held accountable? You're wrong! Because Santa knows all! So one day, you think you're gonna get a beautiful present, but instead, you are gonna be single and unemployed and too weak and intimidated to do anything about it! Okay, here we go. It's okay, all right. Her blood sugar is... Where are your parents? You better not pout, you better not cry. This is one elf who will soon find out why. - [doorbell rings] - [reporter] I'm Jane Lei... Mom? Dad? [both] Oh. Your mom thought you could use some more ice cream about now. - Huh? - [Carol] Hi. How are you, dear? You guys know, huh? Of course we know, it's already gone viral on YouTube. Hey, this is about Lance, isn't it? She who knows everything. Well, I... Come on, tell us what happened, sweetheart. [Krissy] Oh, Daddy. He's cheating on me. With Jill, that girl I told you about. The girl that stabbed me in the back and got me fired and took my job. Sounds like a Country-Western song. Are... Are you sure about Lance? I mean, it just doesn't sound like him. Well, let's say I have it on very good authority. Sweetheart, you know, this would not be the first time you've jumped to conclusions. No, but I... Ugh. And this affair is... Is happening now? It's ongoing? I don't know. Does it really matter when? Could it have happened maybe two summers ago? When... When you took a break to find yourself? We were still together then. Really? Because I had a depressed boy calling me twice a day for over a month, asking how to get you back. He thought we were broken up? May I ask where you're getting all this information about his alleged tryst? Oh, I wanna tell you. I wanna tell you so bad. I can't, though. In mom's hands, it would be a loaded weapon. Well, it sounds like it already is. I will just say there's two sides to every coin. You flip it over, there's always another side. She's right. You're right. - You're right. - Mm. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey! Come on, it's the holidays. - I'm right. - What a gyp. [Carol chuckles] [playful music plays] Lance Leigh. [tinkling] Oh, that's so sweet. [Carol] I couldn't hear what you said, honey. [tinkling] "Has never lied to Krissy Kringle." [Krissy sobs] Just one sec. I'm sorry, honey, what'd you say? Just thank you. [Carol] Oh, honey. Oh. This better be good. We don't go on the clock for another hour. I have a plan to fix everything. With Lance? With everyone. All right, I'm listening. What does this say? Is that a trick question? Something like that. Just tell me what it says. - It says, "naughty or nice." - Except it's not "or." It's not one or the other. There's two sides to the book. Two totally different lists. Meaning you only had half the story. I never looked at it from the other side. - The nice list. - Yes. I mean, nobody's perfect. Just because you're on the naughty list doesn't mean you can't be on the nice list a whole lot more, right? That's fair enough. Lance wasn't lying. He really was working late nights. What about his little escapade with Jill? Yeah. They were together, barely. Once. When we were broken up. What? I missed that part. Turns out I missed a lot with everyone. Even Jill? The woman volunteers at a convalescent home. She probably steals their social security checks. Well, I know she stole my job. Get this, she's been on payroll at a rival firm, giving them insider information, so they can steal Helen's clients. - Really? - Mm-hmm. The plan is to cripple Helen's company, then buy her out, and then Jill will become a partner in the new firm. And the book had all of this? All of it, in great detail. This baby... Oh! Oh! Oh, no. Oh, oh, okay. No, I got it. - Come on. - [Marco] Oh. Oh, this isn't happening. Krissy Kringle. Oh, no, no. Please. Krissy Kringle! Oh, I ruined it. Okay, okay. No, you can fix this. How? Listen, remember when you had your little episode in front of everyone, and you said that you were gonna end up weak and intimidated? That is not the Krissy that I met here on day one. That's because I had this. No, that is just a crutch. You've always had that strength inside of you. But I didn't have all the names and information I need to make my case. Okay. Well, it sounds like you need a good lawyer. Well, we know Mr. Hennessy was innocent, because he was at a family reunion the night of August the 18th. [woman] Miss, you're not allowed to be on the premises. [Krissy] It's an emergency. [Ms. Harris] So if we do our job, we can get him home for Christmas with his wife and lovely daughters. - Hi. - Krissy. What are you doing here? Everyone, it's okay. I come in peace. I know that you hate me right now, but we really need to talk. This is not the time or place. Please, go home. Should I call security? - No. - Krissy... Lance, I was wrong. I jumped to conclusions, and if I'd looked just a little bit closer, I would have realized that you were only with Jill after we'd broken up. I was crushed. I wasn't exactly myself. But Jill? Really? No, no, no, I'm sorry. I was wrong. You are the most generous, loving, kind man that I know. And he's not a liar or a cheat. In fact, he's the exact opposite. He's everything we look for in a man, including being very kind to a woman in the middle of a meltdown. Wait, you're the elf on the news. It's not my finest hour. [woman] Oh, that's her? Lance, I love you. And I'm sorry. I should not have done what I did. Please forgive me. You should go. Can you at least please come over tonight so we can talk? It's important. I'm not gonna go until you agree. Fine. But we are not getting back together. I'll come by to pick up my things. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Debbie, hey! Hi. Look, I just wanna apologize. It's a little late for that. No, no, no. Come on. You shouldn't have done what you did, but I was really wrong too. [sighs] Look, I know that you are a generous philanthropist who donates a substantial amount of money to a lot of local charities. That's supposed to be anonymous. [Krissy] Candy Cane Lane... I mean, we'd just be an ordinary street if it weren't for you. You can't leave. [sighs] Do you know where this tradition came from? During World War II, wives and mothers would decorate a tree as a beacon of hope for their loved ones who were away at war. I didn't know that. My grandfather died in World War II. So this was my way to give back, a way for me to remember him. I realize that I went too far. And I know that's no excuse, but I meant no harm. Believe me, I have been doing a lot of that lately. Doesn't mean we can't fix our mistakes, though, right? Before you go, come over for coffee. Tomorrow, can we say, like, three o'clock? I'll try. Sounds like a yes. Okay. So you saw it, then? It was on the evening news, Krissy. Everybody saw it. Well, okay, to be fair, after the whole restaurant thing, I was pretty upset, and it was the last straw. I mean, I thought you cheated on me. We were broken up, right? I thought you were with somebody else in New York. Lance, there's never been anybody else. I know you're mad. And I would be too, so it's totally understandable, but this isn't about me anymore. I am really, really trying to do the right thing and help someone else out. And in order to do that, I need a good lawyer. Go ahead. You have my attention. Jill is conspiring with a rival agency to take over Helen's company. Everyone's gonna lose their jobs. And I respect Helen. You know, she's a self-made woman. She doesn't deserve that. And you have proof? I did, and then I lost it. So if you can just do a little bit of research and find anything concrete, I can take it from there. [sighs] Lance, I'm really trying to do the right thing, okay? Honest. All right. I'll research it. Well, I mean, you're leaving? I thought maybe you could stay, and we could work on it together. I can't concentrate here. Oh. Is it 'cause you still find me irresistible? Shouldn't you put that sign up outside? I have plans for that sign. Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. Good night, Krissy. [sighs] [doorbell rings] Debbie. - Hi. - Please, come in. [Debbie] Oh, why is everyone here? It's for you. We want you to know how much we appreciate you and everything you do, not only for our neighborhood, but our entire community. [applause] We didn't know that you helped build a rescue shelter for animals. Or that you sponsored our school's music program. And lots of other charities without receiving any recognition. Until now. I... I don't know what to say. Say you won't leave. You think any of us wanna organize the Easter egg hunt or the Valentine's Day party? [all laugh] I wish I could take back what I did. I'm so sorry. Oh, Debbie, there's so much stuff I wish that I could take back recently. But when you care about people, you give them the benefit of the doubt. And because you always take the time to make every holiday so special, we all would like to make your house the honorary holiday house. Not just this year, but every year. [applause] You know, this doesn't mean that we're ending the Christmas decorating contest. Everyone here still wants to beat you. - [man] That's right. - Fair enough. Thank you all for seeing the nicer side of me. Enough of the apologies. Let's celebrate. [applause] - Hey, there. - Hi. Congratulations, Debbie. I hope this means the hologram reindeer will be back in time for Christmas. Of course. I'll redecorate all night if that's what it takes. So looks like you were on to something with Jill. I feel a "but" coming on. But there's no paper trail. Without a bank statement showing that she's on another company's payroll, we can't prove anything. What do you need a bank statement for? Oh, my former co-worker is trying to take down my old boss at Purcell Advertising by poaching her clients for a rival agency. What company? Pogue and Price. They're an ad agency and PR Firm. I know them well. We do their payroll. Really? So you could see if Jill Rhodes was working for them. I could definitely look into it. Why don't you come by my office tomorrow around 2:00? I'll see what I can dig up. Debbie, thank you. Oh, thank you so much. I'm not doing it entirely for you. I also happen to know Helen Purcell, and she throws this huge Christmas party for underprivileged children every year. If she goes out of business, a lot of kids will have a miserable Christmas. Wow. I always thought she was such an ice queen. Well, there are two sides to every coin. So I've learned. Thank you. So... Looks like you really are doing the right thing. Well, I'm certainly trying. - Does this mean that we're... - No. You're still on the naughty list. [both chuckle] I bet Debbie wins best holiday office too. Where do you even buy a fiber-optic Christmas tree? Same place you get a hologram reindeer. Yeah. Well, Krissy, you are absolutely right. Turns out your friend Jill has been working for Pogue and Price on the side for over a year now. And here is your paper trail. That's public information, but if anyone asks, it just fell into your lap. My name is never mentioned. Absolutely. This is exactly what we need. Thank you. I gave a heads up to some of our clients who might have been affected. Really? [Debbie] Well, they're gonna be looking for an honest agency. I told them I know a bright advertising executive, that we'd all be fools not to give her our business. Debbie, I don't know what to say. Say "Merry Christmas." Merry Christmas. I'm really happy we're still neighbors. Me too. Now go and talk to Helen. These companies don't wanna stay in limbo for long. Thank you, Anonymous. So, um, how are you getting to the party later? 'Cause I'm probably gonna need a ride. [sneezes] - [Krissy] Bless you. - Oh, thanks, Krissy. Wait, Krissy? The product appeals to parents, and they're the ones with the pocketbooks, so let's make sure we take advantage of that. Um, also we're hitting both demographics with this. Miss Kringle, what are you doing here? - I'm here to save your company. - What? This is my... My attorney. Mrs. Purcell, with the help of Miss Kringle, I have uncovered some legal proof that you have a mole in your company. This mole has been selling key information about your clients to Pogue and Price and, as a result, picking off your clients one by one. - Who is this person? - Helen, are you okay? I knew Krissy would go postal one day. I just didn't think she'd involve you, Lance. Speak of the devil. If you take a look, you'd see that your employee Jill Rhodes is responsible for the leak. She's on the payroll at Pogue and Price. If her scheme works, she'll be made partner there. Helen, this is all a lie. Krissy is severely delusional. We've talked about this. Delusional? No, no. Delusional is thinking you can still shop in the juniors' section. So did you finally tell her about us? What little there was to remember. Enough. Miss Rhodes, these documents clearly show that you've been collecting a secondary salary for over a year. Helen, she's psychotic. She's got incriminating evidence. So what? Are you gonna release me? No. [chuckles] I'm firing you. Security? Please have Jill Rhodes escorted out of the office at once. Fine, do this. I'll take everything. It's not like I haven't already. That's not true. I actually have verbal commitments from all of these business owners who are eager to start accounts with your firm, if... If you work here? You can't do this. I hope you have a good attorney! Don't worry. I do. - [guard] Let's go. - Let go of me! Thank you, Miss Kringle. And welcome back. Well, before I come back in from the wild, I have just a few requests. I'd like an office. And a parking space. And a 20% raise. [chuckles] I was wrong to assume the worst, Krissy. You're very talented and an asset to this company. I agree to your terms, with one exception. The job comes with a 30% raise. I think I can live with that. [Philip retches] [coughs] I'm sorry. I know this might not be the best time, but, Mrs. Purcell, I don't think I can play Santa Claus tonight. [Philip coughs] Okay, Philip. It... Just go drink some tea. [coughs] Thank you. [Philip coughs] [Krissy] You know, I think I can help. Um, I know about the charity work you do and the party you throw for the underprivileged kids, so if you can just get them here at this time, I can schedule a private meeting with Santa. Are you serious? You know Santa Claus? I'm a Kringle. [chuckles] [kids screaming] Hi! Come on! Hi, guys! - [Marco] Hey, guys. - Welcome to Santa's workshop! We're so excited you guys are here, right? Absolutely. We have a really big night planned for you guys. Santa Claus is coming all the way from the North Pole just to see you guys. Are you ready? - [kids] Yeah! - [Krissy] Yeah? Good! 'Cause Santa Claus is coming to town tonight. [kids] Yeah! And I think I see him. Ho, ho, ho! [kids] Yeah! Merry Christmas. This guy's pretty good. Have you all been very, very good? [kids] Yes! Well, let me sit down and see. Who's gonna go first? ♪ Up on the housetop, reindeer paused ♪ ♪ Out jumps good, old Santa Claus ♪ ♪ Down through the chimney with lots of toys ♪ ♪ All for the little ones' Christmas joys ♪ ♪ Ho, ho, ho ♪ ♪ Who wouldn't go? ♪ ♪ Ho, ho, ho ♪ ♪ Who wouldn't go? ♪ ♪ Up on the housetop ♪ ♪ Click, click, click ♪ ♪ Down through the chimney ♪ ♪ With good Saint Nick ♪ ♪ First comes the stocking of little Nell ♪ ♪ Oh, dear Santa, fill it well ♪ ♪ Give her a doll that laughs and cries ♪ ♪ One that will open and shut her eyes ♪ ♪ Ho, ho, ho ♪ ♪ Who wouldn't go? ♪ ♪ Ho, ho, ho ♪ ♪ Who wouldn't go? ♪ ♪ Up on the housetop ♪ ♪ Click, click, click ♪ ♪ Down through the chimney ♪ ♪ With good Saint Nick ♪ Oh. Hey. Justin, that fits really nice. Yeah, not bad, huh? It's more comfortable than I would have thought. Right? Thank you so much for making all of this happen. It turned out really amazing. No worries, mate. [laughs] I'm glad I could help. Hey, make sure you tell Grams, okay? Yeah. Oh. Merry Christmas. You too. - Thank you. - You're very welcome. All right. Come on out this way. Can we all say thank you to Santa? - [kids] Thank you, Santa! - [Marco] Thank you, Santa! And you're very welcome. Merry Christmas to you all. You continue to be good, and all your dreams will come true. All right, Santa's got a lot of work to do tonight, so say thank you again. Bye, Santa! - [kids] Bye, Santa! - [Marco] Bye, Santa! Oh, this is very kind. Thank you. It's Christmas. That's what it's about, right? Merry Christmas to you. I hope Santa brings you something very special. Oh, he already has. Thanks. Can we all say thank you? [kids] Thank you. Oh, I'm so glad. Bye, guys! [Marco groans] [chuckles] This has been a great holiday. I'm glad you came to work here, Krissy Kringle. Marco, I wouldn't have survived it without you. Oh, please, I loved the drama. I was glad to be part of it. Did you get to ask Santa for anything? I just want off the naughty list. [both chuckle] I think you did that without Santa, all right? Merry Christmas. - You too. - All right. Hey, let me help you clean up. No, no, no, no. I'll do it in the morning. It's my gift to you. Thanks. All right. - Good night. - Bye. [chuckles] Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night. Bye. [sighs] [tinkling] I love Christmas lights. I do. [Santa laughs] Did you know that, before electricity, they used to light trees with candles? That sounds like a fire hazard. Oh, it was. That's why I made sure that little Tommy Edison had everything he needed in his science kit. [chuckles] This red suit is flammable, you know. Do you need a ride or anything? Oh, well, no, I... I have a ride. I came back for my book, Krissy Kringle. [tinkling] Wait, are you... No, no, I'm sorry. That's... That's impossible. That's for you to decide. It's a magical time of year. And you helped prove that tonight, right here with these kids. Alas, I must have my book now. Um... Thanks. You can let go now. I'm sorry. I ruined it. Oh, no. You haven't ruined anything. I've had many cocoa spills over the years myself. [both chuckle] And I knew you would work things out, even without it. Wait, did you send it to me? Oh, no. I just let you have it for a while. What did you say you wanted for Christmas this year? I wanted a new last name. No offense. Oh. I believe the last thing on your list was to be recognized for your hard work and talent and to be happy. That sounds familiar. And were you recognized? Yeah. And are you happy? I'm getting there. Everyone makes mistakes. It's how we respond to them that matters. Follow your heart, and you'll always see the nice side of others first. Thank you, Santa. [Santa chuckles] Merry Christmas, Krissy Kringle. [Krissy chuckles] And to you, a good night. [tinkling] [chuckles] [Krissy chuckles] Hi. Hi. I came here because I wanted to tell you I accept your apology. So does this mean you're my boyfriend again? No. I don't wanna be your boyfriend. Okay. I mean, I... I understand. [chuckles] I wanna be your husband. [Krissy chuckles] I've waited six years for this, since the moment I first laid eyes on you. Krissy Kringle, will you be my wife? Is that a yes? Uh-huh, it is. [Krissy chuckles] [Krissy chuckles] I love you so much. I love you. [both chuckle] What did you do? I didn't think you were ever gonna get to "yes." [applause] Mom. Okay, let me see that ring. [gasps] Welcome to the family, officially. Thank you. - Congratulations, Krissy. - Thank you so much. - Hi. - [Brenda] I'm so happy for you. How did you guys know about this? [Brenda] We're so happy for you. Marco, what are you doing here? Well, maybe there is a little magic this time of year. - Oh, buddy, thank you. - [Marco] Come here. Hi. - This is Lance. - Lance. - Well done, sir. - Thank you, sir. Oh, honey, it's beautiful. So that's why I've been working so hard. [sighs] I love it. I hope it's exactly what you wanted. You are all I ever wanted. Well, that, and my last name. Yeah, about that, um, I was thinking maybe I would keep my name and just hyphenate it. Hmm. Krissy Kringle-Leigh. [chuckles] It has a nice ring to it. - I like it. - I like you. [wind blows] - [man] Holy... - [woman] Oh, my God. Debbie, you didn't get a snow machine, did you? I had nothing to do with this. - I don't believe it. - I do. - This is wonderful! - This is perfect. Oh! It's beautiful. [romantic Christmas music plays]
