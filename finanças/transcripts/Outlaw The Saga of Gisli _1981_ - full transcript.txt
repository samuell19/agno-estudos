Here each affirms his faith with each for himself and his heirs, born and unborn, begotten and unbegotten, named and unnamed, prollering in return loyalty and everlasting loyalty to be maintained forever whilst man and earth endure. For Niord, Frey and the almighty gods. He is nothing to me. I'll have my hands full enough avenging you two without the responsibility for men who are nothing to me. Two can play at that game. I'm not binding myself to anyone who won't stand by Vestein. OUTLAW No, not like that. Not that one yet. in never get it right. Of course you will. It's almost the same as the plain weave. You're so much better at everything than I am. Couldn't you cut me out a shirt for Thorkell? So now you want me to cut out shirts for your husband? It's a shame to let the poor thing be seen in what I make. But he is always asking for clothes. If it were a shirt for my brother you wouldn't ask me to do it, would you? For him I'd do anything. I always suspected you felt that way about my brother. And always will. Well, least said about that, soonest mended. I've no obiection to being accused of liking Vestein. It's nothing new, anyway. All right, enough said. I've heard that you and Thorgrim were very friendly before you were married to Gisli. Since I've been married, I've never looked at another man. No, you wouldn't compromise yourself. But your brother and l... A good gossip may end badly. Hey, look! We've passed them. 0n claw of Wolf. 0n eagle's beak. 0n wings of blood. At causewayside. Vestein! Gisli sent this. He wants you to stay away for the moment. There's danger in the wind. Danger? I might have turned back, if you'd caught me sooner. But from here all the streams run onwards into the fiord. Sliced away The incised characters And stirred With the hallowed liqueur Scattered far On the wide ways To gods, to elves, To wise immortals Some t0 humankind. He's come! Well, what did you expect? So he's come. Look, what's all this about? You ought to know, if anyone. I've always been on good terms With Thorkell. And his Wife? Her as well. What are you suggesting? Ask Gisli. He tells a better story than me. He's gone. Well, what did you expect? So he's gone. That's him. He's got here quicker than I expected. What are we waiting for? Nothing. Except perhaps a change in the weather. I brought these for the three of you, you two and Thorkell. They're magnificent. Since he isn't in the mood to accept anything from me it would be best if you kept them all. My brother's moods are changeable. I don't want anything to do With his moods. I know my brother. He appreciates good things. Do offer them to him. I'd gladly give up my share. You're not sleeping here tonight. Never again. What do you mean? We both know what i mean. Though you've kept it quiet long enough. And it won't help your reput- ation ifI go into details. There's nothing I can do about the ideas you get into your head. I'm certainly not going to wrangle over this bed. Take your choice. Either move over and we'll behave as though nothing had happened, or I'll declare myself divorced from you. Then you won't have to worry about not having room in bed. Have it your own way. You know very well what my way is. Gisli is my brother, remember. I intended one of these for you. Your brother and sister-in- law want you to choose first. l'm hardly the right man to offer presents to. Look first, then decide if you're the right man. What have I done to deserve presents? Nothing. You are my brother. So that's my achievement. Do I get presents for that? This veil is 30 feet long With three gold threads running the whole length. These bowls are edged with gold. YOU have them. This hanging is 30 yards long, would go right round the room. Well, there you are. It's up to you to choose. No, I should be the last in line, if even that. I'm not his brother, not even his brother-in-law. By rights you should have everything. Please, take something, for my sake. Shall I decide for you? My decision is that you take it all. My decision is that we leave now. It's easy to see which way the Wind is blowing. I didn't come here to buy myself off. That was not a wise decision. We'll have t0 fasten down the hay. I'll come out with you. There's no need. We can manage all right. I hope that'll hold till morning. You'd better come and sleep over here. That side is hopelessly wet. Tell me about you and Asgerd. It's all too long ago. So long, We almost forgotten. Well, she hasn't. It's beginning to look like it. Anyway, it was always mostly in her imagination. Well, then, it still is. We were only children. I'm married now, I have two sons. The past is passed long ago. Vestein! Pull out that spear. l'd rather not. If you don't, Gisli Will do it. Then he'll be responsible for avenging the killing. You're not a free man, not responsible for anything. He'll come back and haunt me! Pull out that spear or I'll strike you. He wouldn't haunt you, not his own sister. Gisli or me, Gisli'd be responsible for vengeance. Vengeance? Gudrid! Get ready to go to Sabol. You're out early this fine morning. Vestein has been attacked. Is he dead? Yes. Who did it? No-one knows. Would have been news, once, Tell Gisli that I offer to undertake Vestein's burial. You? He merited respect from us all. Who killed our father? Do you know? It's stupid not even knowing where vengeance should fall. Have you any suspicions? None. Unless you count dreams. Who was it? How much faith can we put in our dreams? cattie perish Kinsfolk perish A man himself must die. 0nly fame endures. A dead man needs good shoes to get him to Valhalla. If those come undone, never trust me to fasten shoe-laces. cattie perish Kinsfolk perish Alone one thing survives: A man's renown. Your side is losing. Even though your best man is out. And hardly in a state to come back in. You won't catch me grieving. Out of the way, you! This hanging is positively antique. What are the spots? Where? All over it. Everywhere you look it's stained. A bit or damp in the chest, I suppose. Haven't we got anything better? I haven't, anyway. What about the one Vestein brought? I certainly haven't got that. It was offered to you. You have a right to it. You could say that formal acceptance got overlooked. I'm having no part in that tapestry. Is that final? Absolutely final. You could always borrow it. Oh no, I couldn't. Geirmund, I want you to go to Gisli's. Ask Gisli to lend met that wall-hanging Vestein brought. l'd rather not. Do you dare... I'm on my way. Very civil of you. I'd rather decide who strikes my bondmen. I'll strike whoever I like whenever i like. There, stretch it out a bit on your side.That's it. We weren't expecting any visitors from Sabol. Is that the hanging Vestein brought? It is. What do you think of it? Thorgrim wants to borrow it. He does, does he? He does. How interesting. Did he talk to Thorkell? He did. Didn't Thorkell like the idea? He didn't seem to want to discuss the matter with you. I quite understand. So the bondman got sent. He did. Paid in advance, too. Generously? With an open hand, in the face. How did you like your wages? DO bondmen have likes and dislikes? What do you say? Do you want to lend him the hanging? Do you need to ask? I have no desire to do them any favours. But my brother was party to this? He didn't obiect to my going. Take it down. It'll feast other eyes than ours this Yuletide. Shouldn't I carry that? You'll soon have quite enough to carry. I've done my best to make things easy for you. Would you do the same for me? In what way? I'm not asking much. Just that tonight two of the house doors be left unfastened. Meanwhile, think over your day's wages. Your brother, no harm will come to him? None. Then I expect l'll manage. What do you think of the hanging? lt W0llld have looked better at Gisli's. Nonsense. Gisli hasn't got the space to do it iustice. He's got plenty of patience though. Here you have at least got good-sized walls. But Gisli knows best how to be grand. He'd never even fit it all into his place. You can always count on me. The ways of fate are uncertain. YOU can count on me t00. Your need may be greater than mine. You gray-beards are such prophets of doom. Some prophesy doom in old age. Others take precautions. It comes to the same thing in the end. Just to see that our friend's horse has been fed properly. Will you fasten the latch after me? You'll wait up and let me in when I've finished? I will. Be sure and give him his fill. The horse. Make sure he gets his fill. You're freezing. Why have you got such cold hands? My hands are perfectly warm. They're frozen. Feel them, then. -Ah, no... not there. Would you like me to... - What, again. Yes, and again and again... What do you think you are? Don't tease me. Wake up! Wake up! My husband has been killed! Get the lamps lit! Eyiolf, make sure the outside doors are fastened. Helgi, you go and check the door to the cowshed. Have your weapons ready. The killer may still be here. The Outside door was fastened from the inside. Then he's still here. Is some- one on guard at the door? Two men. - He wonâ€™t get away. Be prepared for anything. Keep an eye on Thorkell. The door into the cowshed is locked from the Outside. Then that's how he got away. 0utside, everyone! Out of the way! 0ur Orders are that no-one is tO leave the house! I gave the orders, fool! Hurry, he can't have gone far. It's me. You made sure he got his fill? He had enough, and to spare. Don't spoil the tracks! - What tracks? There must be footprints in the snow. - Here! Those are my footprints. We're under attack! They're bristling with weapons and look desperate. There must be at least thirty of them. Your heart is whiter than that milk you're pouring. You crawl into your bed and curl up tight. Try not to let them hear your teeth chattering. Here's a fine-feathered company, up good and early. My brother Thorgrim was killed in the night. 0ne deed Of darkness follows hard On the heels Of another. Who did it? The murderer got away without being recognized. Any marks there were got confused with our own. That was a pity. Did anyone here notice anything unusual? Nothing more unusual than our dreams. Anyone hear people going by? Well, at least I can offer to take care of his funeral. I can't do less for Thorgrim than he did for Vestein. I'll make sure it's done with all becoming solemnity. Well, Thorkell? Of course. In that case... If this one goes adrift,never trust me to fasten a boat. Same old Gisli. How do you mean? Throwing stones. Thordis! It was him. We can't be certain. There isn't enough evidence. My brother killed your brother. What are you going to do about it? I'll do my duty when I'm sure of the facts. Take revenge? - Yes, take revenge. Good. I'll get the sorcerer to put a curse on the murderer. Then the guilt will come to light. No. There's something else you must do first. You can get yourself a wife. I see. First I must get myself a wife. Hey look! What is it? Isn't that were they burnt the boat? - What boat? The one with Throgrim in. Thorgrim's ghost is walking! The ice melted. Where the boat was burnt. Of course it melted. No, now! The water is all bubbling and boiling! So, the sorcerer is at his tricks. Isn't it obvious now who was responsible? It's a strange sort of proof. But incontrovertible. The guilty man gave himself away. It does look like it. Exactly. That's the way it looks like. Where are you going? Out to get together some men. Do you need others, iust to bring the accusation? We won't make it stick Otherwise. Aren't there enough men here? - Not against Gisli. I want to speak to you. Bork is gone to get more men. To formally accuse you of Thorgrim's murder. He thinks the sorcerer has proved his point. 30 does our sister. And what's your opinion? I thought it was time to warn you. And to stand by me? It's not my way to act against the law. i see. l'll warn you if they decide to come after you. But I won't do anything illegal. Killing Thorgrim was acting against me. Careful you don't get dirty. I'll have to leave tonight. Already? They're getting a gang together. - How do you know? My brother told me. Doubtless my sister put them up to it. Are we moving straight to the fiord? I'll go tonight with the bondman. You come later. Would you like this cloak? - Who, me? You've been faithful. This may be my last reward to you. Sit in my place on the sled, I'll lead the horses. There's Gisli. He's making a run for it. Try and give them the slip across the lava. It's his slave! What happened to the other man. He ran into trouble On the lava. What about Gisli? - We'll never find him now. We'll give it one more try. When will you get started? Earliest opportunity. Things should soon start to move. She's never going to tell you where he is. Where is he? Eyiolf! Up with her! You didn't need this tO charm me here. How far are you willing to help me? I'll do anything that isn't illegal. What is it you want? Nothing beyond your resources. A boat to row myself off into the sunset. I might be able to arrange that. l'd pay you back by never asking another favour. I doubt if we're likely to meet again. There's a dinghy coming in. How many men in it? - Only one, I think. It's probably healthier for me to disappear for a bit. l was all right to start with. Now I'm feeling really weak. Come inside and have something to eat. You could stay overnight, if you aren't pressed for time. I'm never usually ill. Might it do you good to come fishing with me? - Oh, no. What happened? It's this pain. I can hardly lie still for it. Try to get some sleep, that'll be the best cure. You're up! I'm feeling a lot better. What about the pain? Gone. Your cooking must have cured me. Thank your husband for me. Ship! Looks like your new brother- in-law. Any ideas? Is your wit as quick as your friendship. My wit may not be quick, but I can suggest one plan. We'll row ashore and fight for as long as we can stand. A fine way to pay you back for your help. I've got a better idea. They're getting close. Say I'm the half-wit. I'll fool about like him. They'll never believe me. Have you any better suggestions? Is Gisli Sursson there? I can't say. Someone is there, a bit out of the ordinary. Like your friend there? - That's the local half-wit. Yes. The crofter's son. Keep still, fool! Where is the proud papa? He went back t0 the island. - Alone? There was One Other man in the boat. Who was it? How am I supposed to know? it must have been Gisli. Have a good time with your half-wit. Do you reckon he's any use to a woman? It's them all right. They're expecting us. Where's Gisli? You rat! Give Gisli up or tell us where he is. I'd rather lose my own life. You're shielding the man who murdered my brother. l've every right to kill you. These clothes are well-worn enough. It won't distress me not to wear them any more. We'll search the island. Just a moment. This half-wit is in rather more places than I thought. Gisli was always a good mimic. Shame on us all if he gets away after this. Take these rings to your master. They'll buy your freedom and the bondman's. He won't get away this time. After him! More spears! Befur! Aren't you ready for bed yet? Do you intend to spend all night locking up? What are you dragging into our house so late? Gisli Sursson, iniured by Bork that fat windbag who is outside with a pack of sniveling curs. But they're not going to find him here. A nice change for you to have a man like that in your bed. I'll bet you wish this had happened a lot sooner. That old hog won't lay his trotters On a wounded man! I'll use all my cunning, you sharpen up your worst temper. Lay it on as thick as you like. You Others act innocent. Of course, you can go and search elsewhere for him when you've made sure he's not here. Who are these ruffians, crashing in on us? They've come to look for a law-breaker. What, in our house? And you stand by and let them do what they like. Pry about as though there were criminals lurking here. You haven't the guts to drive the swine out into the pigsty where they belong! - These men are our friends. Don't you dare come near me with your filthy paws and equally filthy minds. So that's really your game: to take advantage of decent women in their beds at night. Get away from me, you nasty-minded little rat! Keep your smutty fingers for fiddling in your own crotch. He's not here. You're not likely to get near anyone else's. No-one is likely to offer, woman or man, though you might try a man. That's she like when she says good morning? You shameless lecher, any excuse to get into bed with your friends' wives. It's getting dangerous, keeping you here. I quite understand. I'll be on my way tonight. You've been very good to me. We know you're in there! We've got you surrounded! Come out and face what's coming to you like a man. He's gone. After all that climbing! Shall we wait? He's not likely to come back here. We'll go. I've never seen a sword like this. May I have a look? I don't thing there'd be any harm in that. And may you lovely ladies be? You could say we are our father's daughters. 0n can never be sure, these days. Of course, we may be his sons. I never said you could take it out of the scabbard. After them! What are you doing here? We've done a killing. What sort of a ioke is that meant to be? It's no ioke. We were getting vengeance for our father. Who are you supposed to have killed? We did kill Thorkell. Children, children. Killing is a man's work. Vengeance has already been taken for your father. Not to the full. Why are we in exile, Gisli a hunted outlaw? Because he avenged Vestein. Thorkell was really to blame. Thorkell and Gisli were brothers. What possessed you to think of coming here,of all places. He was sworn-brother tO our father. He is Thorkell's real brother and will avenge him too. He's coming back. Hide! I'm sure I heard someone coming. It's all right, they've gone. Who's gone? - My nephews Vestein's boys? - Yes. What did they want with us? Hoping for my protection. They're on the run. They've killed a man. Your brother, Thorkell. How did they do it? I didn't ask. They haven't had much of a start. Which way did they go? Haven't you had enough of this vengeance? There's been no vengeance taken for Thorkell. Gisli, they're my nephews. Which way did they go? You're a changed man. -Did they take the cliff path? You're obsessed with killing. I didn't see them. I'm going to the cave. Have something to eat before you go. Could it have been your brother? Eyiolf is at the farm. Your wife is out of her senses. He offered her a bribe. She is counting the silver. You don't have tO be there when we kill him. Bloodsilver. I'll make sure you're taken care of. Thanks all the same. I can do as I like with this? Anything you fancy. And now, where is Gisli? It's all there, iust as you promised. Where is our man? Take that for your treachery, and much good may it do you. To believe I would sell my husband to a wretch like you. Get that bitch! May you always remember that a woman struck you. KiII that yelping bitch! We're not making ourselves thoroughly infamous. Are you always going to stand in my way? Think what you're doing. I'm not leaving any more. But they'll be coming. Yes. They'll be coming. Would you sleep better up in the cave? It's safer there. We'll search by the river. There he is! It's time to stop running. 0nly cowards die on the run. Come on, then. Attack. I'm not going anywhere. This will be our last meeting. You strike the first blow. It's your score to settle. I don't need advice from you. Get round below there! I always knew I had a good wife. Get up there and get hold of the women. So, the miserable coward has run off again. Very heroic! There he is! He's up there. The silver promised for my head will be dearly bought. Your final reward will be infamy and lasting shame. What do you think you're doing? He killed my brother. It was your idea in the first place, remember. Is the wound serious? A scratch. Name your compensation. I'll be happy to pay. Give me your hand on that. Are you really such a petty- minded wretch as that. I'll take compensation for two killings. I hereby declare: l divorce myself from my husband. Suits me if you'd like to count out the silver now.
