A NIKKATSU COMPANY AND CENTRAL MOTION PICTURE COMPANY JOINT PRODUCTION A NIKKATSU PRESENTATION 1958 TAIWAN STRAIT This is Captain McClaine speaking. Our ship "The Dragon" is due to reach Kinmen Island in a few hours. Here's the latest news from the mainland. Be advised! Yesterday, China's army opened fire on Taiwan. As of now, Kinmen Island's navigation routes are cut off. However, the restrictions only apply to military units. We, on the other hand, are classified as civilians. Therefore, we are under no risk. But the time frame for loading the cargo has been shortened from two weeks to ten days. Also, disembarking is strictly forbidden until further notice. Since the state of martial law has been declared on Kinmen Island, all crew members are expected to comply and stay aboard. Over and out. Damn, now we'll be languishing here for ten days. Think about those who are fighting now.

It's been three years since I left Japan. I've been to all the ports around the world. And my journey is going to end here in the port of Kinmen Island on Taiwan. But, the closer I am to the shores of Japan, the more acute is this strange feeling in my heart. I wonder why? Four years ago, it was exactly this time of year. It was a bloody and pointless war. Everyone was exhausted and covered in dust. And then one day, after a bombing raid, UN troops were sent to Japan. UN HOSPITAL Having just finished my internship in Germany, I was a surgeon in Keikai Hospital in Tokyo at the time. Every single day, hundreds of wounded soldiers were brought in. Mr. Matsuzaka! Look who's here. Collecting material? Yes. They say hospitals in Kyushu are full. War is a nightmare. Not everyone thinks like that in Japan. There are also those who benefit from war. I want to show them what's really going on. Fortunately there's one person in Japan who tries to ease the suffering. And he works 24/7. - You're here to visit Takei? - And I haven't come empty-handed. - How do you feel? - Very well. Great. - Take care of yourself. - Thank you. (Speaking Chinese) Excuse me. (Speaking Chinese) Are you looking for someone? Wan Yoo Se. A war correspondent, then. Have you come from Taiwan alone? Yes. I'll try to find out. Thank you. Is he your brother? Or boyfriend? Yes, here it is. Is anything wrong? "DEAD" What is it? What is it? Tell me. He passed away two days ago. What? He's dead. Are you alright? Doctor! We're ready for surgery. Please take care of her. Yes Sir. I've been looking for you. What for? Here you go. Wow! You haven't come to see me for a while. There's plenty of work here. We have a shortage of staff. - I'm going to perform yet another surgery. - Do you work late? - Why? - I wanted to invite you to the cinema. Can you go out from time to time? How about tonight at six? I'll try to make it. Great. I'll be waiting in the cafe of Japan movie theatre. OPERATING ROOM Scalpel! - Hello! - Hello! How's the surgery? It has just begun. Do you think brain surgery is a hard thing? What do you think? It's basically drilling someone's head. Damn. The patient has convulsions. Looks like we're not going to be able to remove it. The tests we ran suggested it might be a difficult case. It might be cerebral embolism. It might be. But we can't rule out other possibilities. If we carry on, it might kill the patient. We have to do everything we can. Clamp. The surgery is over. How did it go? The patient died during surgery. Was the patient's condition too serious? Or was it the surgeons' mistake? We did everything we could. The most recent innovations were applied, but the patient was too weak. No way! Mr. Ishiyama was in excellent health! That's right! I don't believe my father was too weak for surgery. It can't be true! You're mistaken. Doctor, we demand further explanations. Right, we won't accept claims that the patient was too weak. Brain surgery was successful. But the medication that was administered brought about convulsions and organ damage. In other words, the cause of death is anaphylactic shock? We can't say exactly. - Was the medication American? - No, Japanese. A new formula from Takagi Pharma. The problem must be this new medication. It's a new product. Anything can happen. Hold on. Antibiotics produced by Takagi Pharma are just as good as American ones. What do you know? What happened was partly our fault. Takei! The patient died of cerebral embolism. Cerebral embolism? It's a condition in which a clot is formed in the blood vessels of the brain. Symptoms are very similar to encephalopathy which the patient had been diagnosed with. Wrong diagnosis was the real cause of the patient's death. I can imagine how he must have felt at that moment. But where is Takei? He asked me to tell you that he can't come and that he's going to your father. Kaoru! You shouldn't meet today. But... I'm not going to sit and watch a movie either. Give him some time. I'm sure it'll be fine. So, you're saying our medication has nothing to do with it? Of course not. Still, your statement... is going to be a major blow to your stepfather head surgeon. But I don't have to tell you that. How about you come and work in our laboratory? Mr Takagi... You're my best friend's son, after all. When I sent you for that internship in Germany, I realized the extent of your talent. If you accept this job, you can do a lot of good. I'm flattered by your words. But I don't see myself working in a lab. Don't get me wrong. I am grateful. But I would really like to continue my practice as a surgeon. Takei! In each area, there are hidden forces. They are called "factions". If you think you can go on with your life like before after this, then you're wrong. I understand that. That's why I'm asking you to let me work on my own. I want to see what I'm really worth. If that's your decision, then there's nothing I can say. But please don't involve my daughter Kaoru. I know how much she loves you. But, as a father, I don't want my only daughter to suffer. Do you know what I mean? I understand how you feel. But... Please let us figure it out by ourselves. Hello? Yes, it's me. Doctor Incho? I'm sorry for all the trouble. Of course. I will tell him. Goodbye. Takei, he says you should get back to the hospital. Why shouldn't I tell the truth as a doctor? No matter how good a doctor is, he's bound to make mistakes. If doctors talked about it on every corner, all hospitals would be forced to close down. You're talking about mistakes, but each mistake is someone's life. I'm not saying I don't understand how you feel. But I want you to understand that you're a part of a team, not an independent practitioner. Also, you can't become a good doctor without cool judgment. I understand. I'm submitting my resignation. Why do you want to leave? I'm a doctor. And if I start thinking about slogans or codes of honor, I won't be able to save lives. How dare you? I quit. You won't kick me out. So, you're leaving the hospital, and you're throwing your lying boss under the bus. Also you're biting Takagi's hand which feeds you. Not funny. I've always wanted to be a real doctor. Oh, come on. What about Kaoru? She loves you. I love her too. But the question is how she's going to feel about me after all that's happened. That's what worries me. I don't want to criticize you. But maybe you should make up with your future father-in-law? Father-in-law? If I were you, I'd join his lab and marry Kaoru. That would be a great life. What's wrong with that? Watch where you're going! Hold on. What is it? Wait. What are you doing here dressed like this? You have a fever. Do you know her? She's registered in Taipei Taiwan. Yan Rei Chung. 19 years old. Yan Rei, huh? There's nothing but plane tickets for two days later in her purse. And 20 dollars. And a pack of Brovalin. She probably wanted to kill herself. Matsuzaka, sorry to ask this. Can you send the papers? Of course. Don't forget to call, though. I promised Kaoru that you'd call her. Do you remember me? From Keiai Hospital. (Speaking Chinese) Hold on. (Speaking Chinese) (Speaking Chinese) You're at my place. Calm down. You were walking in the rain. (Speaking Chinese) MEDICAL ERROR? EX-GENERAL SECRETARY DIES IN SURGERY POSSIBLE CAUSE - ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK May I? Come in. You probably already know something from your father. That's why I'm here. There's something I don't understand. What is it? I want to know what you think about us. You've never talked about it before. First, I'd like to ask you something. Go ahead. I left my job in the hospital yesterday. I'm going to start from scratch. Can you give up everything you have, and follow me into the unknown? That's what I want to know. I don't think we'll have to live in poverty. What do you mean? I'm going to have your own clinic built for you. Kaoru... If I ask my father, he'll do it for me. And then you... No. That won't do. I cut ties with your father precisely to avoid something like that. So, when you tell me to give up everything... do you want me to disavow my own father? Of course not. If I become a successful doctor. and you're happy with me, Mr. Takagi will be happy for us too. Surely you understand it's hard for me to give an answer right now. But... That's the decision we have to make. Kaoru... Hold on! You can't get up yet. Don't worry. She might be better off without me. Look. It's Tokyo. Beautiful, isn't it? Over there is Shibuya. And over there is Shinagawa. And that way is Tokyo Bay. Why did you save me? Why? My father was a war correspondent. He worked in the First Sino-Japanese War. He was killed near Shanghai. I was raised by my mother. Then, the Pacific War broke out. Bombing raids began. I was evacuated and stayed in a village temple. My mother worked hard, but always visited me once a week. I was counting minutes until her arrival. But, one day, she didn't come. Tokyo was bombed heavily. When I came back, there was nothing but ruins. Neither my house nor my mother were there. I was looking for her everywhere. And, then, I found her. All that was left of her was a handful of dust. I didn't know what to do. I didn't have any family left. I really felt like dying. But, as you can see, I'm right here in front of you. Sorrow is a part of life. It's still with me now. But I always look up at the sun and tell myself that, one day, it will shine for me too. I know it will. And it will for you also. One day, you'll meet a man who will love you. "So, how did you like Tokyo?" "It was great." "So, you won't cry anymore?" "Promise?" "Promise?" "Good." "Here's a small gift for you." "Come on, open it." Takei... I'm sorry. Sorry for all the trouble I caused. Don't worry about it. You were suffering yourself. Let's try to fix things together tomorrow. We might never meet again. But I'm sure you will be alright. TOKYO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT Goodbye, Rei Chung. All those words of comfort that I said to that girl... I needed them myself the next day when I went looking for a new job. Why should a doctor go against his conscience? After that incident in Keiai Hospital, no clinic would accept me. Matsuzaka, I decided to become a ship doctor. That will give me an opportunity to visit lots of fascinating countries. Every month, I will be disembarking in a different one. In Japan, I keep banging my head against a brick wall. But, if I was someone who's going to give up, I wouldn't have left the hospital in the first place. You will probably laugh at me as usual after reading this letter. But I will never turn a blind eye to wrong things even if it harms me. I chose the hard way and that's my choice. When you get this letter, I will probably be somewhere in the Pacific. I know that, in this endless ocean, I will find something to heal my wounds. Maybe I will even start living in the middle of the ocean. My jokes aren't funny as usual. Anyway, we might not see each other for a few years. Maybe I will come back to Japan a better version of myself. I'd like that. I'll do my best. I regret it now. Whatever happened, I shouldn't have let him leave. Kaoru... I wasn't sure that I could give up everything for the sake of my love to Takei. I realized it only after he left. Now, I know I don't need anything else. However hard it could be, I would manage. Listen... Do you really love him so much? It doesn't matter now that he's gone. Are you sure you're not going with me to the island? After this, there's only Japan. This stop is second to last. Attention all crew! Man overboard! I repeat! Man overboard! What happened? We fish. Bomb explode. Ship go down. I see. Sorry to hear that. It's going to be alright. (Speaking Chinese) (Speaking Chinese) What is it? It's the army. They look for us. Why are you worried? You're just fishermen. We go far, they see us. They catch us, they kill. No court. Please. - What is it? - I'm Captain Liu Choi. I think you picked some men. They were here. They're gone now. Matsuzaka! Takei! It's you! What are you doing here? I'm here on a business trip. Investigating a local conflict. What a surprise! I heard poachers were caught and then I see you. It's been a long while. When did you leave Japan? About three years ago. When you got on a ship, I packed my things and left. - Three years? - Yes. Arabia, Algeria, Laos. I've been places. It's ordinary people that suffer the most in this war. Take fishermen from Kinmen Island. There's constant firing by the shores. It's impossible to catch anything. So, they are forced to go further in the sea. And then they get killed. The right to live is earned in struggle, be it war or competition. Those who lose can't solve problems, they just keep running away. Matsuzaka, why are you here? What makes you take part in this? What do you mean? Japan just got too small for me. There is occasional fire along the shore. In the morning, behind the reef... What? Reef! In the morning behind the reef, a fishboat took fire and sank. I'll send details from the headquarters. And there's also... Are you Takei? You have a letter. It came through the naval office. Thank you. From: Kaoru Takagi To: Kazuo Takei From Kaoru? Singapore-Taiwan. It was sent two years ago. Read it. Don't be shy. Why did you do that? Nothing would change if I read it now. Don't you regret it? Not really. Are you happy with your life now? Yes. I chose it myself, after all. You haven't changed. Kaoru regrets it, though. Matsuzaka. It's been four years. It's over. Artillery. Rei Chung! What? Rei Chung! Rei Chung! Doctor! What's going on? I show you! Come! Come! Do you know Rei Chung? Quick! Quick! Come! Here. Here. Inside! It's our friend. Please help. Quick! Quick! I'm the doctor's friend. Actually, I want to ask you something. How do you feel looking at your wounded friend? I'm on your side. I want you to be heard by thousands of people around the world. Speak up. Hold on. My name is Tetsubun Wan. I'm the head of the community. You're Japanese, aren't you? Yes. He's a doctor and I'm a special correspondent from the Nitto paper. We'll sort out our problems ourselves. Leave. Don't you think enough people have been hurt? Why cause all this suffering? It must be the war. Why? You Japanese can't understand it. We're people too. We know what suffering means. Go away. But... The more you write stupid things about us, the worse it gets for us. Stop it. (Speaking Chinese) Rei Chung! Takei! I knew it was you! (Speaking Chinese) So, you are Takei? Mr. Wan is Wan Mira's father. He's our stepfather. I see. You're her younger brother? I'm grateful for your help to Rei Chung. Thank you. I've tried to write a letter many times. You wanted to write me a letter? I kept my promise. Remember? I do. When I feel sad, I look at it and remember you. And I feel better. I work as a teacher in a school now. I live my life to the fullest every day. Like you told me to. Rei Chung! You've changed too. You're probably right. I'm calmer and happier now. That's not true. Before your face was light. Now it's dark. You're not happy. Not true. I can see it. Become the way you used to be. Don't ruin my dream. My dream. Don't run away. Don't run away. What? Rei Chung! Where have you been? I understand that you're grateful to this Japanese man. But you have to pull yourself together. You're getting married soon. Congratulations! Let's have a drink to your happy life together. And where is Rei Chung? Takei! I came here to ask your advice. I wanted to do the same. Flowers? I picked them over there. What did you want to ask about? You're weird. Rei Chung! "So, how did you like Tokyo?" "It was great." "Will you go to Tokyo again?" "I can't." "No one will let me." (Speaking Chinese) Rei Chung wasn't wrong about me. When I look at her, I remember the old me. She is everything that I've lost. Rei Chung! Would you like to go to Japan with me? You can take your brother with you. I'm penniless right now. But together we'll manage. Besides, I'm sure we'll be happy. You should talk to Mr. Wan. Are you sure that's a good idea? Let's go together. I can't right now. See you later. Rei Chung! I heard about your recent exploit. As a Chinese, I'm grateful too. Have a seat. Thank you. (Speaking in Chinese) I'm glad that everyone is well. Takei! I wanted to talk to you face to face. Me too. That's a nice boat. We'll see how long it lasts. I have a limp because a Japanese soldier shot me in my leg. It was on the continent. After the war ended the government, everyone decided to forget the past and move on. But I don't like Japanese people. - People laugh at me saying I'm stuck in my ways. - No, I understand how you feel. But... I think you're different. You seem like a person who is capable of being a good friend. See that over there? Do you know what it is? It's the city of Amoi. A few decades ago, we left the continent. And settled on this island. Over there is our motherland. Our traditions, our history and our memories lie in that city. I'd like to go there again someday. My friends and Rei Chung's parents... ... they all died and filled my memories of home with grief. Can you understand how we feel? I think I can. But is war really the only way to return home? It was a difficult decision made after long considerations. We didn't want to choose the way of bloodshed. But if we don't fight, we'll never set foot on the land of our ancestors again. Our army is led by Captain Ryu Jo. But our main assets are loyalty and unity. I'm Rei Chung's stepfather. Ryu Jo is also close to me. It seems natural for me to want to tie them with marriage. I decided that they will get married once the war is over. I see. That's all I wanted to say. Now I will listen to what you have to say. I have nothing to say. I think I should go. Sorry I couldn't tell you myself. But I love you. Nonsense. Why couldn't you? Ryu Jo is a great guy. Except, I don't love him. I've loved you all along... Rei Chung, you must forget me. No, I can't do that. I can't live like this. I want to go to Japan with you. Listen, Rei Chung, you have a shared history that no one else has. I can't just brush it off. Wherever you go, you'll carry this history with you. And one day you will regret... that you left your motherland behind. Do you see what I mean? No. I don't want to. (Speaking Chinese) Xiaoei! Xiaoei! Takei! Be careful! It's not safe! Xiaoei! Wake up! Xiaoei! Clamp. Clamp. Tweezers. Do you have any medication? Not here. Only in the headquarters. I see... In that case, it's risky to carry on with the surgery. He might lose a lot of blood. We have to take him to the nearest field hospital. It'll be fine. I'll contact the base right away. Thank you. I'll go too. Xiaoei is my only brother. Go ahead. A wedding can be held anywhere, even in the field hospital. We don't have a lot of time. But, once you arrive, stay there. Takei! Please don't betray my trust. I'm counting on you. - I got permission from the Captain. - Thank you. Please take this to the headquarters. It's my manuscript. I'll catch up with you in a week. TAIPEI AIRPORT Excuse me, how do I get to Kinmen Island? To Kinmen Island? There's a ferry. Once a week from Kaohsiung Port. Kaohsiung? Here is Taipei. Here is Kaohsiung. And here is Kinmen Island. When is the next one? In five days. But there's no guarantee you'll get on it. What do you mean? There's heavy shelling. It's dangerous. Mr. Wan, you should go to the shelter. We can't run from this island. We already fled from the continent once. Mr. Wan, it's dangerous out here. I'm not going anywhere. Save the boats! If we lose the boats, we're dead! Move! Quick! Help the civilians! A letter for you. Ah, thank you. I'm in Grand Hotel in Taipei. Contact Takei - Kaoru. TAIPEI You're a lucky man. A couple weeks and you'll be out of here. Sister, shouldn't you be at your wedding now? Next ferry is in five days. What are you talking about? My brother wants to see a big city. Is doctor Takei here? It's me. I've just got to the headquarters. It's pretty hot on the island right now. Your ship sets off the day after tomorrow. So, I have to be in Kaohsiung, then? What should I do? There are no flights either. There's also a military ship. It follows the same route as the ferry. You should make it. So, I'll head for the port tomorrow. You're checking out of the hotel tonight. Don't be late. See you. Rei Chung... We need to separate here. Everyone will be there tomorrow. I feel lonely. Stay with me a bit longer. Divination. About our future. Is everything going to be OK? Rei Chung? Congratulations. It says that you will be together forever. When we first met, it was also raining. And now we're saying goodbye on a rainy day. Good song. It's about how a girl can't forget her loved one. I want to go to Japan with you. Please don't ask me such a thing. I understand. Can you do that? Then, just stay with me today. I'll buy cigarettes. Goodbye, Rei Chung. If someone comes or calls, I'm not available today. Well, you have a visitor waiting in your room. Oh, it's you. An express train leaves at 4:30 PM tomorrow. Goes straight to Kaohsiung. Thank you. And there's one more thing. Someone wants to talk to you. Kaoru! Well, I'll leave you to it. I wanted to see you, no matter what. And that's why you came here? I couldn't wait. I couldn't wait for the day you return to Japan. When my father learned about my feelings, he told me to go find you. But I'm not coming back. I will give up everything and follow you. If you want me to give up my father and his wealth, I'll do it. I ask you for one thing only - come back to Japan with me. Hold on. Kaoru... I'm not the same person I was four years ago. And my feelings for you... I wrote you so many letters. I didn't read them. I'm sorry. And one more thing. I'm going to be frank. I just broke up with the woman I wanted to marry. So, if now... after hearing you out, I say "OK, let's go back to Japan", what will you think of me? Takei! Cut the crap. Kaoru says she's ready to give up everything for you. I understand that. But... Have you thought about her feelings? Rethink this. Only you can make Kaoru happy. Takei! Say something! Stop it! Please stop! It's a shame your father can't see you like this. A parcel for you. Thank you. The ports are closing. Our ship is departing urgently. We may never see each other again. Be happy. We'll meet again. I'm sure of it. Don't be sad. Where is Rei Chung? She said she wanted to be alone. Orders arrived. We're heading for Kinmen. The wedding must be called off. Rei Chung! Rei Chung... Mira! Have you seen Rei Chung? Is something wrong? We can't find her. She's gone. The floor is covered in tears. She must have gone looking for you. Is Mr. Takei still here? He just went out. It's you? Where is Takei? He must be on his way to the port. Please help me find him. Let me introduce you. This is Kaoru Takagi. And this is Rei Chung. Nice to meet you. I believe we already met in Tokyo once. Kaoru has come all the way from Tokyo to see Takei. Takei is going to marry her. Matsuzaka! Rei Chung, please stop messing with Takei. You must hurry. I'm not going. What? I'm leaving with the ship. Do you think it's so simple? If you miss the ship, you might not get another chance. Let's go. Was Rei Chung here? She wasn't. Tell me the truth. Kaoru! That's not true, is it? I never did things properly. I hurt those dear to me, then tried to fix it and failed again. But now I've made up my mind. I don't want to go with the flow. I want to be a man. To take control of my life. Kaoru, forgive me. But I love Rei Chung. And if I don't find her, I'll be miserable. Go to her. Kaoru... She just left. The train leaves at 4:30! At last... he's found what he was looking for. I would have loved to hear those words... said about me. Rei Chung! Rei Chung! Rei Chung! Rei Chung! Takei! Mira! Where is Rei Chung going? Tell her there's ship that goes to Kinmen. It leaves today from Kaohsiung. I'll be waiting for her there! Understand? Hey, over here! Matsuzaka. I'll be the last to embark. I'll wait for Rei Chung. I'm sure she'll come. I told her you're going to marry Kaoru. You did what? I thought it would be better for you. Everything is ready for departure! Let's go. (Speaking Chinese) Why was the wedding cancelled? Rei Chung loves only one man - Takei. Nonsense! You should respect Rei Chung's feelings. You're going to yield to some Japanese scum? I'm sorry. But I think it's better for Rei Chung. No! No! You will see him soon. Thank you. Everyone, get in the LVTs! Everyone, get in the LVTs! Duck! LVTs are very safe. We won't let anything happen to correspondents. We're here to show people what's going on, not to hide! - We understand the risks! - Yes, tell them that. What the hell are you doing? Duck! Are you out of your mind? Matsuzaka! I think someone's got hit. Takei! Takei! Matsuzaka! Cut it out! Matsuzaka! Hold on! Matsuzaka! I've been in hot spots for three years! I'm not so easy to kill! Fire in the cabin! We're about to blow up! Get in the water! Matsuzaka, get up! - Sorry about this. - Imagine it's a swimming race. He will drown. I have an idea. Matsuzaka! Hold on! We're going to make it. Swim, you fool! It's all your fault. Matsuzaka. Dad! Why have you come back? Our ships sank! There are many dead. Takei is in danger too! Please help them. You disgraced our family and now you're asking me for help? Please! Send the boats! I'm not going to risk our boats to help the Japanese! We only have a few left. You're wrong! What? You just hate Takei and your hatred is killing people! We are all indebted to Takei. Have you forgotten how many lives he saved? There were so many innocent people from different countries on those LVTs. Why do they have to die? All they want is peace! Why aren't we helping them? And now you want to leave them to die? You're a disgrace to the Chinese people! Please! Save them! Please! Save them! (Speaking in Chinese) Wait! Let's go! Do you know a Japanese reporter and also doctor Takei? They're just ahead. Over there! Matsuzaka, get up. We're on the shore. Matsuzaka! Matsuzaka! Matsuzaka! Wake up! Matsuzaka! I see. Why didn't you say anything? Matsuzaka! You fool! Takei! Takei! Takei! Takei! Takei! Rei Chung! Rei Chung! Takei! Rei Chung! Rei Chung! Rei... Rei Chung! Rei Chung, hold on! Rei Chung! Finally, I found you. Shame it's too late. It's not, Rei Chung. This is only the beginning. Whatever happens, I'll never let you go again. I'm so happy. Rei Chung, stay with me! I'm so glad I met you. Rei Chung! Rei Chung! Stop it! Enough! Stop! Enough! Enough! Enough! THE END
