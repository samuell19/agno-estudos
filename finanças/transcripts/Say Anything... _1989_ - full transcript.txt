- I don't feel anything. - Come on. It's graduation. Did you see what Mr. Carroll wrote in my yearbook? Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, - "You're a real live wire. Love, Mr. Carroll." - You know, it's all so phony. He wants to leave things on a good note. Well, when Mr. Carroll uses the word "love," I look for a new word. Lloyd, she's being difficult. - I'm gonna take out Diane Court again. - That's unlikely. Is the movies a good second date, you know, as a date? - But you never had a first date. - Yes, I did. I sat across from her at a mall. We ate together. That's eating. - Sharing an important physical event. - That's not even a scam. - What's a scam? - Going out as friends. - No, it's not. Scam is lusting. - Then what's a date? A date is prearrangement, with a possibility for love. Then what's love? I'm gonna call her. Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you. She's a brain. Trapped in the body of a game-show hostess. Diane Court does not realize how good looking she is. This sounds great to me. I'm gonna call her. That's what's cool about her. Brains stay with brains. The bomb could go off, and their mutant genes would form the same cliques. I wouldn't get my hopes up, Lloyd. I'm sorry. It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want you to get hurt. I wanna get hurt! "Well, it's almost over. "We've gone to school together for three years." I might cut that part. Why? That's fine. It's nice. "Having taken a few courses at the university this year, "I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back." "Go back." What a great line. - You like it? - Yeah! - I didn't think anyone would get it. - Oh, no, no. It's-It's wonderful. It's- Yeah? No, don't worry about it. You're very funny. "Go back." That's great. - All right. No more. I'm gonna save it. - Okay. I love you guys. Thanks, bro. Party at Vahlere's. There's gonna be eight kegs. See you there. - Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe! - Thank you, Joe. Thank you. Thank you, Joe. And now it's time. I just can't introduce this person without saying... history, oceanography, creative writing... biochemistry. I think you know who I'm talking about. We're going to remember this student who said, "Hey, world, check me out." Giving a speech entitled... "Soaring Ahead," Miss Diane Court. Thank you. - The real world. - Look at those eyes. We're all about to enter the real world. That's what everybody says. But most of us have been in the real world a long time. But I have something to tell everybody. I've glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back. Well, it's almost over. We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot. But with that training net of high school gone, what's going to happen to us? We all know what the answers are. We want to be happy, go to college, work hard, maybe raise a family. But what if that doesn't happen? I have to be honest though. I have- I have all the hope and ambition in the world. But when I think about the future, the truth is... I am... really... scared. - All right. - Get up on it. - Yea! All right. - Hey, yea! - I'll see you at home. - All right. - Now, do yourself and everyone who loves you a favor- - All right, Mom. - And don't talk to Joe. - Mom, Mom- Stop. Okay? - Bye. - See you later, Mrs. Flood. - Bye. - Bye, Mrs. Flood. All right. Look at those eyes. - Lloyd, give it up. - Do me a favor. Take a picture of me with her. - Lloyd- - Just do it. Please? - That's just so embarrassing. - Please? - All right. - Just do it. All right. Okay. Sure. It's your life. - Wait for me when I get around her... together. - All right, man. I got it. Your graduation present is parked right over there. Are you kidding? That? - Lloyd? I'm sorry. - Hey, Sis. Sam had me do a new crown, we had two root canals to do, and Jason has a sore throat. Your big graduation, and no one was there. Hey, it's no problem. I called Mom and Dad in Germany. It's like they were there. - I hope you understand. - Hey, bad throat, J-man? - Yeah. - Yeah, he's not at full "Yeah!" strength. Poor little man. Why do you eat that stuff? There's no food in your food. Not too loud. The red line's there for a reason. How do you know how to draw the red line anyway? Because it's loud enough, and the neighbors don't complain. That's how come I know. Good thing there's not a red line on you, J-man. Yeah! - Yeah! - He's back! Hey, my brother, can I borrow a copy of your Hey Soul Classics? No, my brother. You have to go buy your own. Hook you off the jab. Hook up the jab. Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate? Jesus Christ. - What? - Get in a good mood. How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood? It's easy. Okay, I'm sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really. If it's such a big deal, I'll go. But remember this. You used to be fun. You used to be warped and twisted and hilarious. And I mean that in the best way. I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry... that T-I-M left you. But I am not T-I-M! - I was hilarious once, wasn't I? - Yeah. I still am. Dad, you have to teach me the stick shift this weekend. Okay, promise. Now, just don't go upstairs yet. Come here a minute. I want to show you something. - What are you doing? - Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend... - I had to get you two presents. - Oh, God! This is ridiculous! Now, this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours. Well, go ahead. Open it now. Oh, God! I don't need all these presents. I don't know any kid who got a car. I mean, it's- Oh, God. It's beautiful. They really applauded you today, honey. I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me. I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses off-school, 'cause... everybody thinks I- - Forget it. - No, wait a minute. Everybody thinks you're what? Everybody thinks I'm a priss. Diane, in a million years you could never be a priss. It's all working out for you, honey. Do you see? It's working out just like we planned. All the... All the years, the summer schools, all the vacations you gave up. - It's all working out just like we planned. - Stop it, stop it, stop it! Sorry. I love you, Dad. I love you too, honey. Come on, come on, come on! Come on, come on! Come on, J-man. Come on. Get the bag. Come on. Yaah! An exciting kick. My brother, let's go. Yaah, yaah, yaah! Put the gloves down. You're headed for day care, buddy. - Be tough, J-man. - He's a mess! I'll be in my office. I just washed this shirt, didn't I? - Yeah! - Please, not in my ear. Not in my ear. - Jim Court. - Hello. May I please speak with Diane, please? Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment. - Okay. - This the guy with the Mustang? - No. - The guy with the Datsun? No. - The truck? - No, not-not really. No, actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm- I'm a friend of your daughter's. Well, I sat with her yesterday at a mall. I drive a blue Chevy Malibu if you- I guess I'm pretty bad at this, but what I want to do is-Could I please- Why don't I get a phone number from you? That's usually how it works. Okay. Lloyd Dobler. 555-1342. That's 555-1342. - 555-1342. - Okay. I'll get her the message. - Okay. She's pretty great, isn't she? - What? - She's really pretty great, isn't she? - Yeah, she is. - Good luck, kid. - Good afternoon. Okay, bye. Jim Court. No, this is her father. Can I take- What? No, I didn't get the letter. Yes! Yes, right away. Ye-Thank you. Good-bye. Oh, Mr. Taylor, you're a vision in green. Here, let me mail this for you. Thank you. Yeah, you can trust a man who writes a letter every day. - Is Diane here? I gotta talk with her. - She's upstairs, Mr. Court. Okay. I gotta tell you this carefully. Oh, Lee, Ben, could you do me a favor? Just a couple minutes. - Yes, sir, Mr. Court. - Great. Won't be long. Thanks. What? I just had a phone call. Tell me. Is it bad news? No, just listen. You won the Reed Fellowship. Are you kidding? You're not kidding? You're not kidding! You won it. You're gonna study at the finest institute in England. - The toughest fellowship in the country, and you won it. - I won? You're gonna take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss. You stand up straight and admit you're special. God. I'll have to go on a plane. Worry about that later! Now, come on. Tell me that you're special! Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous. No, listen to me! You're the best in the country. Don't you understand? It's like... a pyramid. It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything. And all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person... who is so special they celebrate you on two continents. And it's you. So tell me something. Where's the flaw in that? There is no flaw. Hello? Yeah. Just a second, Corey. - Oh, sorry. - Diane Court. - Don't-Don't go in there! - Forget it! Forget it! It's mine, it's mine! Too bad! No noise, no sound, no movement. Nothing. Hello. Diane? Hi. You called me? Yeah, I read about your fellowship in the paper. I'm very glad you called me back. - Yeah? - Yeah. I just wanted to congratulate you on that scholarship to England, and I wanted to just tell you I thought your speech was really incredible. Thank you very much. What a day? Yeah, what a day. - Yeah. - Yeah. Quick question. Do-Do you know who I am? - Yes, we sat together at Bell Square. - Yeah, yeah. You remember. No, I read it on the message. Okay so it's Lloyd and let's go out. You wanna go out? Oh, thanks, but I'm busy. - Busy. - Yes. - Things are hectic now, but thanks. - You busy on Friday? Yeah. I have to help my father. Are you busy on Saturday? Saturday I have some things to do around the house. So you're-So you're... monumentally busy? Well, not monumentally. What about tonight then? You gonna go to that party at Vahlere's?- I can't allow you to leave the country without attending Vahlere's graduation event. This gentleman is-He's 22, and he comes out of hiding, like, once a year for this occasion. He dresses up as the Lakeside Rooster, and he makes this drink called the Purple Passion. - Actually, I think that... - You're not in England yet. You know that, of course. By the way, I lived in England for three months. My parents are in the army, so we lived in England and Germany. I could give you an enormous amount of tips-many tips, English tips. Well- - No tips. I won't give any tips of any kind. - I'll go. - Pardon me? - I'll go. You will? Excellent! All right. This is great. - You will? Really? - I'll go. All right. This is really great. All right. We're goin' out. It's a date. It's a scam. Whatever, whatever. All right. I'll pick you up at, what, 8:00? - 8:00. - 8:00. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. Lloyd Dobler. Thank you, little man. Now work that bag! Work that bag, J-man! Left hook! Hook off the jab! Straight left hand. - What do we love? - Pain! Work that jab! Work that hook! Work that hook! Okay, take a break, take a break. Be right there. Hi. Lloyd Dobler, sir. How are you? Pleasure to meet you. Hello, Lloyd. Hello. Heard about the graduation present. Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy. You don't have to entertain me, but you can trust me. I'll tell you about myself. I'm 19, been overseas for a couple semesters. Now I'm back. I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink. Ever heard of kickboxing, sport of the future? Don "The Dragon" Wilson? Benny "The Jet" Urquidez? Murray Smith? Champions of the sport? I can see by your face, no. My point is, you can relax. Your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours, sir. Fine, Lloyd. Come in. Thank you. - How you doin'? - Okay, fine. - Is she around? - Yeah. Honey? - Hi. - Hi. - Would you hold this for me? - Yeah. - What are these? - Bavarian Dutch-style pretzels. Would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early? No. Hi! Oh, my God. Hi, Lloyd! You okay? - Want a drink? - What's up, Lloyd? Hey! - Hey, Dobler! - We are out of control! Dude, that's not happening. I gotta go to summer school, if you can believe that. Dude, I know what- Hey, Lloyd! - Hi, Lloyd. - How you doin'? It's gotta stay purple all night. - Lloyd, buddy! - How you doin'? You know Diane Court? Diane. Well... Listen, man, I need you to be the key master. - I was just... - A very responsible young man you're out with tonight. - Thanks a lot, Lloyd. - I was just gonna kind of move around. - Thanks. - Key master? Yeah. I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I gotta keep their keys. So it's an honor. No. We finally graduated, big dude guy! All right! I'm so glad you came to this. I've always wanted you to come to one of these. Here's my keys! I wish you had done that without your keys in your hand! - Come with me. There are so many cute guys here. Come on. - Let go of me! - I love you, man! - I love you too! - Homeboy. - Hey! - Mike Cameron. How you doin'? - What? - Mike Cameron. This is one fresh jam? - Yeah! Yeah. Hey... Oh, God, listen. I- I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you. - How'd you get Diane Court to go out with you? - I called her up. But how come it worked? I mean, like, what are you? I'm Lloyd Dobler. This is great. This gives me hope. Thanks. All right. Key? I wrote 63 songs this year. They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight. I just saw Joe. He's here. Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it. You did try and kill yourself because of the guy. What was it like after it happened, Corey? I've always wanted to know. She explained it all on Wake Up, Seattle. Where were you? Stop! I am fine now. I'm all right. All everybody does is ask me about this, and I'm fine. Did Joe come with Mimi tonight? Keys. Keys, anybody? - All right, key master. - All right. - Hey, man. - Hey, how you doin'? - Good. - Lloyd! - Lloyd Dobler, I got you. - How you doing, Miss Evans? You missed every one of your career-counseling sessions. - Call me obsessive-compulsive, but let's do this right now. - No way! - Lloyd. - What? - Get away from me! - What did I do? - Don't even follow me! - Don't do this. - Leave me alone! - Don't make me sound like a counselor, Lloyd. I've got statistics I can show you. I have graphs I can show you. I got all this stuff I can show you. It all says the same thing. You have to decide on a career. My dad's a lieutenant-colonel in the army. He wants me to join. He wants to pull some strings. I mean, there's no possible way. Let me just make an appointment for you at Seattle Junior College. - You the key master? - Yep. I'm not gonna go to Seattle Junior College. I've gotta be honest with you. I'm not looking for that. I'm looking for something bigger. I'm looking for a dare-to-be-great situation. Lloyd, everybody in that party put something on their record except you. How many of 'em really know what they want though? A lot of them think they have to know, right? But inside they don't really know. So, I don't know. But I know that I don't know. Hang tough, Lloyd. I know we were "all too competitive" this year, but I just want to say... that if it wasn't for "Diane Court"- I probably wouldn't have gotten into Cornell, because you made me study twice as hard. - So thanks. - You did the same for me. I did? Did you really come here with Lloyd Dobler? How did that "happen"? He made me laugh. Yes. He's okay, Dad. I- You're welcome. I always call you. You know that. Call you? All right... Stop being so grateful. All right. I'll-I'll be home before dawn, okay? Bye. - Oh, would you guys sign my annual? - Sure. - Would you sign mine? - Yeah. - Did you really have to call your dad? - God, how nightmarish. - I promised. - Is he gonna wait up? - Tell him nothing. - Nothing. I make sure I enter the house crying. He leaves me alone. I loved in your speech when you said you were scared. Lloyd Dobler. All right. Hey, what's up, man? How's it goin'? I'll be in the kitchen, Joe. - Joe, Joe. She's written 65 songs. Sixty-five. They're all about you. They're all about pain. So what's up? So stop freaking with her head, man. Stop playing with her mind, you know? She's a human being. She's a person. She's very talented, you know? Dude, why do you think I keep her tapes, man? Gonna be valuable some day. Oh, my God! Joe was my first love. He was my first sex. And the whole time, he was going out with Mimi. He'll never break up with her. But if I see him, it's, "Hi, Joe. How are you?" And that is it. I'll be okay. Don't worry. He's at the other end of the house. It's too bad more guys can't be like Lloyd. He checks up on me. Look. I've got more songs to do. - So we can finally talk. - Yeah. Well-What? Lakewood, Lakewood have no fear! How about another year? He does this every year? The worst job since key master. Hi, Joe. How are you? I love you. I love you too. You invade my soul. I wanna get back together. Mimi's gonna go to college, and I'm gonna be alone. But I'm gonna break up with her before she leaves. Have sex with me. Good-bye, Joe. You know, every year I throw this party. Every year nobody helps me clean up. - Why am I yelling? - I don't know. I don't know. We're outta here, man. - All right, Lloyd. Thanks. - Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clean up. Diane, everybody loved that you showed up. - You're a great rooster. - Well- - Sign this? - Okay. Hey, Cor. So I'm single now. Everything's changed. I hate it. - Give me my Firebird keys! - You must chill! You must chill! I have hidden your keys. Chill! - I love you, man. - All right. I love you too. - Go to sleep. - We're full-on buds. Yeah, right! - Later. - Hey. You're such a great person, Lloyd. I'm a good person, but you are a great person. - We're outta there, man. - Yes. - See you tomorrow. - See ya. - Bye. - Bye, Diane. Bye-bye. Hey, drive safe. Thank you. I hereby surrender my duties as key master. Gimme a beer. Certainly. I'm happy to say that this sack is officially empty. The back bathroom. Let's go. - Oh, look at this gentleman here. - I gotta get home. Gotta get home. Excuse me. - I'm sorry. - How you doin', brother? You know, I don't even know where we are. I'm about to play you three hours of commercial-free rock and roll... I love this album. It's a good one. You like it? Do you recognize anything yet? Anything? Lord, have mercy. Three hours of commercial-free rock and roll. Good morning. Hey, that's it! That's my house! I live there. - Well have a good sleep. - Bye. Thanks a lot. Hey, you guys are the best. Give me a call, or... - Look at this one. - Did you... So what did they write in your book? What did they write to Diane Court? All right. Listen to some of the things they wrote me. "Glad I finally met you." "You always seemed nice." "Wish I could've known you more." Mine says stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe." Nobody knew me before tonight. They knew of you. Now they know you. Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I held them far away from me, so they did the same to me. That's cool then. Yeah. I'm so glad we did this. - We can walk from here. - Okay. - So it's just you and your dad, right? - Yeah. - That's a whole story you don't want to hear. - Sure I do. Well, my parents split up when I was 13, and- God, I actually had to- I went to court, and I had to choose between the two of them. So I chose my dad. Just felt safer that way, you know? Watch out for that glass. Thanks. - But either way, it's still... - Yeah, twisted. - You know what? - What? You're a great date. I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you. Basic. - So what's your job this summer? - Job? Being a great date. - No, I'm serious. - So am I. I want to see you again... as much as I can before you leave. Said it! I only have something like 16 weeks. Sixteen weeks is a long time. Then call me tomorrow. Today is tomorrow. - Then call me later. - Okay. Thanks. I'll-I'll call you later. Good morning, honey. Dad, I'm so glad I went. Good night. Wait, wait, wait a minute. How was Lloyd? Lloyd was such a gentleman. He was funny and nervous and strange. And I met people I would have never met before. And then I blew it. I called him "basic." Can you believe I did that? Well- I don't think he's reeling in embarrassment. - Good night. - Good night. Yes! - Lloyd is doomed. - Meaning? Meaning that she made the second date a family audition, - which is the kiss of death for Lloyd. - Why? It's too much pressure. It's not his crowd. - What's wrong with this girl? - I told him to be himself. But he's got that nervous talking thing. I told him not to speak. I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd. If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd? - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. - You think I should wear this dress? - Yeah. Or- Or I could always wear this one. That's nice. I forgot to tell you who'll be at the dinner tonight. My dad's accountant and two women that work in his nursing home. I know you don't know them, but it'll be fun. Boy, this is a mother dictionary! I know. I've had it forever. I used to have this thing with marking the words I looked up. Or I have this one. - That's a nice one. - Yeah? - Yeah, you should wear that. - Think so? - Get... Better get downstairs? - Yeah. I gotta change. It's a great meal, you two. - You just look beautiful, Diane. - Oh, thank you. Same eyes, same nose, same mouth. See what a few millimeters can do? So, what airline do they send you over to England on? - A charter. - She's not the world's greatest flier. Let me tell ya. - When she was eight years old, she- - Dad. - Now, why can't I tell the story? - What story? - If you're gonna tell it, let me tell it. - Well, let me start. I'm flying down to Los Angeles on business, and I decide to take her on her first airplane. I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous. Crash paranoia. I had a checklist in mind. I thought if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash. But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't. So anyway, they close the doors and she starts to scream. I never in my life heard anybody scream like that. - Then you got up, and you told them to turn the plane around. - Which they did. - Let me finish. - Okay, I give up. So anyway, these two federal marshals meet the plane, and they take our address, and they ask us never to fly the friendly skies again. You never flew? No. But there's more. Oh, yeah! There was... Somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio. And we get this telephone call, and this guy's making a sound-effects record, and he'd gotten our address, and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream. Which they did. And every once in a while on a commercial... you can hear me scream. You two are amazing. You know? They way-They way- The way you talk. I'm just like... I'm not even like that with anybody. It's a stellar jukebox, sir. Thanks, Lloyd. How do you obtain one of those? What did we pay for the Wurlitzer, Al? Well, that guy didn't want to part with it. A little matter of $9,000? - So, Lloyd, you graduated Lakewood, right? - Yes, sir. What are you gonna do now? Yeah, Lloyd. What are your plans for the future? Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves. Seriously, Lloyd. I'm totally and completely serious. No, really. You mean, like, career? I don't know. If... I've thought about this quite a bit, sir. I would have to say, considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career. I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought... or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed. You know, as a career, I don't want to do that. So my father's in the army. He wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation. So what I've been doing lately is kickboxing. Which is a new sport, but I think it's... got a good future. As far as career longevity, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell. If you're eight-and-six as a fighter, it's no good. You have to be great. But I can't tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked down yet. I don't know. I can't figure it all out tonight, so I'm just gonna hang with your daughter. Hello. Mr. James Court? - Yeah. Can I help you? - I'm Mr. Sims, and this is Mr. Talbot. We're special agents of the Internal Revenue Service. And we'd like to inform you that you are under criminal investigation... for the tax years 1982 through 1986. Jesus. What, I live in a palace, right? I have guests here. Understanding the following rights... Speak with my lawyer. So you refuse to answer my questions? Just come down to my place of business, for God's sake. I have people here. Mr. Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates- - This evening is over. - And your former wife. - Mom, please. - Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest. I see you so seldom, I'd really rather hear about you. This is me telling you about me. You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life. I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with Dad. If we could just talk about boys, everything would be so much easier. You know, your room is always ready for you. You can come home if you want. All right. What do you want me to do? If they ask you questions- and they probably will ask you questions- would you please say something nice about him, Mom? Help him? - All right. - You will? Okay. Oh, here's Ray. Just talk to him, 'cause when you don't, your mouth turns down. Hi, honey. Hello, pretty ladies. - Hi, Diane. - Hi, Ray. So what are you doing after work? I usually have a break after the dinner service if you want to stop by. Want to do something later? I know you think my job is strange. You don't like old people, do you? - Me? Sure I do. - Come on. Well, except for one thing. I used to work at a smorgasbord, and, you know, the old people would flock there, and they loved to eat. They'd just jam their mouths, you know? They just would eat with their mouths open. To be honest, it's just too much for me. I mean, you... you get to be thinking about how short life is... and how maybe... maybe everything has no meaning. Because you wake up, and then you're frying burgers, and then you're, like, 60 and 70, and then, you know, you check out. And what are you doing? I just don't need to think about those kinds of things. So that... that's the reason I was... But I'm not sure I'm right about any of that. I think that's ageism. That's being prejudiced against people because they're old. Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours. Really? I... Well... You're really turning me around here. I was just looking at it the wrong way, I think. Should I still come by? Stop by later. - Okay. All right, I will. - Okay, bye. I'll-I'll see you later. Bye. - You have to meet Bess. - Okay. She's amazing. She's 93, she's a writer, and I told her about you. Wait a minute. You told her about me? - Yes. - What'd you say? Just meet her. - Hi. - Hi. This is Bess. Lloyd, Bess. - Hello. - Hello. You're too tall. She likes you. Okay, how you doing? Hello. I'm Lloyd. We're gonna watch this movie Cocoon. I've never actually seen it. I hear it's very good. I hear it makes you very happy. I figure that's a good film to see... one that makes you happy. It's about a group of older people who go to outer space. Hope I didn't give anything away there. - The movie hasn't started yet. We're gonna have a good time. - Thank you. - Are you going to stay and watch? - Sure, we'll both stay. - Why can't I eat popcorn anymore? - I'll get you something. Okay. So, here we go with Cocoon. - So they're cool. - That was good. Good, good, good. I feel so bad being with you. I feel selfish. I feel like I should be spending more time with my dad. I mean, it's not fair to you, when half the time I'm with you I'm thinking of other things. - Thank you. - It's okay. Everybody does that. I just don't want it to get too heavy. I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence that good things always happen with bad things. I mean, like, I know you have to deal with them at the same, you know, time. But I just-I don't know why they have to happen at the same time. I mean, I don't know why. I just wish I could work out some sort of schedule. - Am I just babbling? Do you know what I mean? - No. I just can't have any social life right now. Don't worry about it. We're just having coffee. We'll be antisocial. - Be friends? - Yeah, with potential. Friends with potential. Yeah, keep going in first. Keep going around. Get the feel of it. - Feel the clutch. If you put it in a little? - Yeah? You know how it'll come out, and it feels, you know... Little more, little more. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's all right. - Go around just in first. Just feel it. - Right. - It's kind of all right. - Yeah. - But now when I... - When you feel confident- - Yeah? - If you'll just maybe ease it into second. - Well, all right. - Put it-Put it- All right, listen. Am I wrecking my car with this? This is very important. Yeah, you are a little bit. But listen. It's important. When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in. - When you feel... - I was putting the gas on when I felt... Yeah, 'cause then... A little more gas, more gas. Ease it out. All right. No... Minor setback. - Now that you're feeling confident, right? - Yeah? - You feel better about it. - Yeah? Now go into second. A little more gas. Yeah! You get this- You get this, no problem. Hey. Now maybe you'll downshift... to first. - Does it sound normal? - Well, no, it's not normal, but as you get better, you hear less of it. Brake, brake. Get the brake. - Let's switch. You wanna switch? - Yeah. I'll drive? All right. I'm sorry. - Let's get out of here. You want to? - Yeah. Okay. - Are you comfortable? - Yes. Are you shaking? - You're shaking. I don't think so. You're cold. I don't think I am. - Then why are you shaking? - I don't know. I think I'm happy. Here's some blanket. - Listen to this song. - It's a really good song. Good morning. - Dad, I'm sorry. - You should be. I was irresponsible. I should've called. You bet you should've called! You still live at home. Don't make me call the police at 3:30 in the morning. Don't make me call hospitals! Dad, I'm so sorry. I know this is a bad time. You've always called before, always. Now I'm not asking what you did. - I just wanna know if you're all right. - I'm fine. You wanna make things easier on me? Then tell me where you were. Because this is- this is bullshit! You can say anything to me. I hope you still know that. I know that. I spent the night with him. - Lloyd? - Dad, yes. And... I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now. Sit down. Dad, do you know what he did the first night I went out with him? We were walking across by the 7-Eleven, and... he pointed out some glass for me to walk around. And I always think of that when people say, "What are you doing with Lloyd Dobler?" And-And I never get nervous around him. So we started spending all this time together... as friends. But... I could feel him getting anxious. And then... I knew that there would be a confrontation over getting physical. He started to get that look at the end of the night. Do you know that look? And then, you know it's gonna be an issue. So I went through all the different feelings... and all the different arguments you're supposed to go through. - Did he ever get rough with you? - Dad, no. But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him. But then I attacked him anyway. It always feels good to tell you the truth. Because if I can't share it with you, it's almost like it didn't happen. Did you sleep with her? - I admit nothing. - Lloyd? It's us. Look at his face. He did the deed. You're an inspiration, Lloyd. You should go on The 700 Club or something. All right, all right, all right. Calm down, all right? Calm down. Nothing's different. Lloyd, listen to me. - Everything has changed. - You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two. You might be 60. You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever, but what you'll really be thinking is, "We had sex." - What's the point? - You've got to do something special. - You've got to make a statement. - Wait a minute. I- You've got to show her respect. - You've got to show her that you're not like Joe. - Wait a minute. And above all, just because this happened, gives you no right whatsoever- - I always sit here listening, and you never let me talk. - What? I'm sorry. Talk. I forgot what I was gonna say. Okay. Okay, I remember. - Let him do what he wants. - All right. Yes! Lloyd, send her flowers or write her a letter or something. - I already did. - What's it say? - Just read it. - I can read it? Oh, man. "Dear Diane," "I'll always be there for you." "All the love in my heart, Lloyd." I've never gotten a letter like this. Have you? I dream about it. So what do you think? Is it-Is it- You think it'll- Get ready for greatness, Lloyd. The Cynthia Bramson estate was worth how much? - Because her family... - What family? We never heard from them. I sold a house for her and made her money. - Your income, Mr. Court, hasn't changed substantially- - Thank you. - In 17 years. That's right. - Why would you stay so long with an operation... - Please, some coffee, Mr. Court. That is so clearly not a growth enterprise? Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr. Sims. I hope you write that down. I'd like your bosses to read it. Diane. Your ticket to England came today. Dad, maybe I shouldn't go, with all that's happening to you. - You're going. - But listen. If I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year. You're going. It doesn't feel right to me. I- I don't even have the right luggage yet. Bon voyage. - You're not listening to me. - Diane, all right. Now let's stop this right now. Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous. This isn't even smart thinking. Dad, why are you acting this way? Is this because of the other morning? Do you love him? I like him a lot. Well, listen to me. Now, I know you like him. I know he's nothin' like these frat kids you can't stand. But, honey, after the excitement wears off, then what? I mean, what are you gonna talk about? What do you have in common? You're gonna be part of an international think tank, and he's gonna be... kicking punching bags. - I just think you should break up with him. - Unbelievable. - This is nightmarish. - Diane, you owe it to yourself... to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings. Because after you get over there, things are gonna change. - People change. - Dad, you and I have talked about this. Lloyd and I have talked about this. Believe me, this is well-covered territory. Diane, I'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. I... Give him a present. Here. - Let him know you still care. Give him this pen. - A pen. Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen. - What's wrong with having some fun? I like him. - "I like him"? - I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent... - Dad, I love him. Great. No, that's great. I... It's great to hear you say that, because... I don't know. What, am I being selfish? I... I... Why am I so fixated? I guess it's because I got a lot of troubles with... I... Is that it? Am I- Am I being selfish? I just want you to have everything. Is that wrong? No... I owe you an apology. Just got a handful of weeks left with you, and we should... I don't know. I don't know what I'm trying to say. They think I'm guilty. Some computer spits out your name, and another honest man... What's the goddamn point? - Live your life. I love you. - Oh, Dad, I'm so sorry. All right. Now power left! Power right! All right, who's world champion? Who's your hero? Don "The Dragon" Wilson! Lloyd, telephone! Keep kickin'. Kick the- Hello? Hi. How are you doin'? Yeah, they actually pay me for this. Yeah. Yeah, I'll pick you up in an hour. See you later. You should check your mail tomorrow. - I sent you a letter, a blue letter. - Your letter came yesterday. It did? - It was wonderful. - I wish... Why didn't you tell me? It was wonderful. I never sent a letter like that, you know? I mean, I sent it. Well... I don't know. I felt like I wanted to tell you somethin' I didn't put in the letter. I didn't say it, but I think I wanna say it now. But I'm not sure if I should say it, 'cause people always say it when they don't mean it, but I think I mean it. - So I just wanted to tell you that... - No. We don't have to say it. - How do you know what I'm gonna say? - I don't know. - I was gonna tell you I love you. - But if you think you- - I said it. - I know. Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level. What? This is a good level. Isn't it? How can I look at you and say this? Say what? I think that we should spend some time apart. - What's wrong? - Well... - I need to study, and I... - You need to study? - Yeah. - Okay. How much time do you need? I mean, you know? I mean, you're gonna be leaving in a little while, so I'm just asking questions. We'll see. Okay. - It's good knowing this. - Yeah. Wait a minute. What did we just decide? We decided... - Because I'm worried. Did you just break up with me? - No. No... - It sounded like you did. - No. We decided that we're friends. I mean, I know it's a terrible word... Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other? I think that we should stop going out on dates. I feel like a dick. - You must think I'm a dick. - No, I don't. - I don't. - Yeah, you do. Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share. - You shared it with a dick. - No, I didn't. - Is this because of your dad? - No. - You talk to Corey? - Why? Did you tell Corey what happened? - She figured it out. I'm sorry if that upsets you, but... - No, that's fine. She'll tell everybody, but that's fine. - Did you tell anybody? - Just my dad. You told your dad? You have Corey and D.C. I have my dad. What? I'm sorry I said that. Forget I said it. I said what I thought I meant, but... - Lloyd... - Forget it. - I love you, okay? - What is that? What are you doing with your hands? - Don't... Don't be... - Talk to me. One party and you're talking like that girl Sheila. Don't be mean. This is hard for me too. Then don't do it. Oh, shit. Would you just take this pen, please, and write me? - I don't believe this. - You just broke up with me. Hello, Constance? It's me, Lloyd. Nothing, I'm just driving around. She broke up with me. What do I do? Think she'll come back? How can I get her back? Can't... Can't get her to talk to me. It's all so fucked up. I feel like crying. She gave me a pen. I gave her my heart, and she gave me a pen. Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay? I'll be home soon. My friends still don't know what they're gonna do after graduation. But I've already locked in guaranteed skill training... in the army. Qualify now, and you can reserve for even... the army's most sought-after technical training- up to 12 months in advance. It's me, cruisin' around. It's pretty late. I know I haven't called you lately, 'cause I didn't want to be reminded of the Diane nightmare. By the way, I hardly remember... I've wiped her from my mind. I don't remember the time and place when I knew her. Yeah, this is it... the site of our controversial first date. I met her in a mall. Should have known our relationship was doomed. To our left we have the street where she broke up with me. There's the path we took. Corey, I guess in a way I blamed you. I held it against you, lettin' me send that letter. But I don't know. I thought it was the right thing too. I think I know too many girls. You know, I should hang out with more guys. I should be like one of those guys... who hangs out at the am/pm or the Gas 'N Sip on a Saturday. But I don't know. Guys like that really know the answers? Lloyd, man, no babe is worth it, dude. - Listen, hang with us, man. We'll teach you bibles full of truth. - Right. Lloyd, man, you can't even trust 'em, man, because you know what it's about? They spend your money, and they tell their friends everything, man. - It's about economics. They tell 'em everything. - That's valid, man. Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, - nail her and then dump her, man. - Dump her, man! - Get her off your mind. - Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first. Diane Court is a show pony. You need a stallion, my friend. - Walk with us and you walk tall. - Walk tall, my man. Bitches, man. Hey, dude, I better bail. I got a question. If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at, like, a Gas 'N Sip on a Saturday night... completely alone, drinkin' beers and no women anywhere? Well, it's- - By choice, man. - That's right. - It's a conscious choice. - It's a choice, man. - We're choosin' to be here. - We all wanna be here. - I'm choosin' it. - Dude, where'd she dump you, man? - In a car. - Your car? - Man! Dissed in the Malibu? - Heinous! - Hey, that's your castle, man. - You never had a chance with a girl like that. Hey, man, I was in love once, man. I got hurt really bad. I never want to go through that again. - Man, you're bringin' me down! - Shut up, man. We're goin' to a kegger, Lloyd. We're goin' to a kegger, and we'd like you to come, man. We're gonna find you a girl. We're gonna find you a babe, man. We're gonna find you one hot-lit babe instantly! - Promise. - Nope, nope. - That's right, man. - One hot-lit babe instantly! - Look, I'm... I'm not going to meet somebody like Diane Court at a kegger. This girl was different, man. When we'd go out, we wouldn't even have to go out, you know? We'd just hang out. The girl made me trust myself, man. I was walkin' around, I was feelin' satisfied. Can you imagine that? Then she cuts me loose. I don't know why. - She won't tell me why. - Who knows the real reason? Maybe it's 'cause of her father. I don't know. - She won't talk to me. - She won't look at me. - Come on! You're freakin' out! - Christ, Lloyd. What is up with you? - You're wiggin', man. - Chill, man. Come on. - He's wiggin', ho... - Dude, I don't even feel that way about my car, man. Dude, name a babe, all right? Any babe in Seattle. - I'll set you up with her. Diane Court! Dude, I can't do it, buddy. - Hey. That was a mistake. The rain on my car is a baptism. I'm the new me. Ice man. Power Lloyd. My assault on the world begins now. I believe in myself, answer to no one. You probably got it all figured out, Corey. If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise. Look. Why don't you just call Diane again? - I draw the line at seven unreturned phone calls. - Lloyd, you have to understand, her family is being ripped apart- like you and she were ripped apart. Like Joe and I were ripped apart. - Visit her at the home. - I'm not goin' back there. - I don't even know who you're talkin' about. - Why do you have to be like this? - Because I'm a guy. I have pride. - You're not a guy. - I am. - No. No, the world is full of guys. Be a man. Don't be a guy. If she wants me, she can come to me. Hi. Lloyd. This is my eighth and final call. Well, go ahead, pick it up if you want. I just wanted to say that I thought about everything, and I decided something. I gonna give you another chance. Maybe no one's listening, or maybe your father is listening. Hey, Mr. Court. If you're listening to this, hello. How are you? - If I pick it up, we'll only get back together. - Then don't. - You know what's best. - Anyway, maybe I didn't know you. Maybe you're a mirage. Maybe the world is a blur of food and sex and spectacle, and everyone's hurtling towards an acropolis, in which case it's not your fault, you know? Maybe it's a good side to this. I've been thinking about things. You're probably standing there monitoring. So just one other thing. The letter that I wrote you- could you please rip it up? Nuke it. Flame it. Destroy it. It hurts me to know it's out there. Will you do that for me? All right. Later. Hello? - Hi. - Is it a gift for your wife? We could put a set together. - No, I'm not married. It's for my daughter. - Oh, going to school. - Yeah, she won a fellowship. - Good for her. - I'll take the whole set. - Excellent. I gotta tell you. You... You got the best smile I've seen all week. Thanks. I like yours too. Listen, I don't know your name, but... what are you doin' for lunch? I'm sorry, but they turned down your card. Well, here, then let me give you another card. - Thank you. - Thanks. I- I'm afraid I can't accept this one either. There's a... "decline" code on your account. I'm supposed to confiscate your card, but why don't you just- go ahead and take it? - Oh, keep it. - You sure? Yeah, I don't want it. Thank you very much. You've been very kind. Dad, are you okay in there? I'm just finishing up in here. Regarding James Court. - Room 14. - Thanks. I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship... that I worked for my entire life, and I don't even care. I met this boy over the summer, and I... I can't see him because of this, and I can't... I can't talk to him. I can't talk to my father about this. And I wore these clothes. I thought-I thought that... if I looked right, and if I acted right, then someone would talk to me. But I look awful, and I feel awful. Could you... Could you please talk to me? Be a little decent. All right. We believe that your father operates from a large pool of cash... that comes from phony billing, phony patients. We've been investigating him for five years. - We believe, when they die, he takes their money. - Pardon me? Look, why don't you check it out for yourself. See if your father fits the profile. - What's the profile? - Well, take a look around the house. Is everything nice but not too nice? Are there a lot of rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment furniture- a lot of things bought with cash? Does he give a lot of gifts? Do the major items in your house hover around the $9,000 range? You're trying to get me to say something. That's why you're telling me this. Don't let your father's business infect your life. How can you- How can you say that? - Because he's guilty. - No. He's not. We have the records. We have the proof. I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse. Now if I were you, I would take that fellowship. Dad? Anybody home? They made me doubt you. What happened to you? Dad, did you do it? Did you take that money? Sweetheart, no. Don't be ridiculous. - Swear to God. I need to know the truth. - Honey! - Swear to God. - I swear to God. I found the money. - Honey, it's not what you think. - What am I supposed to think? Well, honey, about what? You stole from them! You lied to me! How do you think that's supposed to make me feel? - Oh, think you know what this money is? - Yes, I... No, you don't know what it is! It's not for me. This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors, to set you up so you never have to depend on anybody again. Diane, I take better care of those people than their families do. I care for them. I give them flowers. I feed them. I wipe their mouths. - No, but you stole from them! - I make their lives better! You let me defend you. And you knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it! God, Dad, how could... All right. All right, go ahead. When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead. I trusted you. I stood up in court five years ago, and I picked you. Why are you being so hateful to me? - Is this because of Lloyd? - No. I told you everything, and you lied to me. - I would have done anything for you. - That's right. Work it out. No. I will. I don't want to leave something out, 'cause I know I can say anything to you. You're a liar and a thief. Take it easy how bad you make me. I'm the only dad you've got. I'm so ashamed. Dad. - No, don't say that. It's not good for you. Don't- - You're right. No, talk... Diane? Wait. Diane? Wait a minute! Now talk- Hey, Lloyd, someone's here to see you. Lloyd? God. Lloyd, I'm sorry. What do you want? I'm sorry. What do you want? My father's guilty. He lied to me. He lied to everybody. I just left home. I need you. - You do? - Everything else means nothing to me. If I hurt you again, I'll die. Hurt me again? There's not a chance. Don't worry about it. I love you. - What? - I love you. How many more times do I have to say it? One more time would be nice. I love you. Please. I love you. Wait a minute. One question. Are you here 'cause you... need someone, or 'cause you need me? Forget it. I don't care. I need you. I love you. - $75,000 fine and no jail. - I can't give you that. This guy's been rippin' off grandma and grandpa for 17 years. He's been getting it from every end. I'd love to hear his story. $100,000 fine and three months? - 125,000 and nine months. - I can accept that. Course, they're gonna want to turn the home over to the state. - He'd like to start serving immediately. - I can put that together. Confirm this with my office and my client. - I'll push it past my boss. - All right. Just sleep. I brought her all the way here. She said she was gonna come, and wouldn't get out of the car. I thought it was important to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere... and not deal with family stuff, that you're just gonna... she's gonna... all... I just... - You going to England with her? - That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about. - Are you? - Am I going? Am I going to England? I've thought about it quite a bit, and I've realized, what I probably should do is just carve out a goal, find what I want to do with my life... stuff I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right? What is she gonna do? Is she just gonna run off with some English guy? There's no way. Well, Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride. - You know, my daughter's a lot different from you. - I know. - She's very successful. - I know. - She's very talented. - I know. But then I reconsidered. 'Cause I figured, what I really want to do with my life... what I want to do for a living... is I want to be with your daughter. I'm good at it. You're not a permanent part of her life. You're a distraction. I'm the distraction that's goin' with her to England, sir. You all right, sir? You okay? I'm incarcerated, Lloyd! I don't deserve to lose my daughter over this. I don't deserve to have you as my go-between, and I can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion mediocrity... the way she's learned to around you! I have a letter from your daughter. Do you want it? - Thank you.. - Visiting hours are now over. All visitors must check out with the attending officer. - Visiting hours are now over. - I don't know which version she sent. - "You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel." - I know this part. Keep reading. She can't still be angry at this. - It's gotta get better. - It does. It does if it's the version signed "I still can't help loving you." It gets better. Just her name. Just knowing a version like that exists- that for a minute she felt that and wrote, "I still can't help loving you." That's gotta be a good thing, right? Gotta be a good thing. Hello. Hi. I don't know what to say to you, except good-bye. You could have told me the truth. I'm so sorry. I love you, Dad. Write me. Wing adjustments. It's like a big roller coaster. Everybody likes roller coasters, right? Blink twice if you're fine. I'm fine. Okay. Good. This is all very normal. - Very standard for a 747. - Okay. All right. High-level airline safety tips: If anything happens, it'll happen the first five minutes of the flight? Okay. So, when you hear that smoking sign go ding, you know everything's gonna be okay. Good to know. All right, I'm just gonna keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon. Okay. All right. Personalized flight gift from Corey: Books, cassettes, magazines, anything? - Not right now. - Thanks. How's it goin'? Nobody thought we'd do this. Nobody really thinks it will work, do they? No. You just described every great success story. All right. It's all right. It's all right. I know. Where's the ding? It's comin'. Any second now. Any second now.
