What the hell do you mean? How can he not qualify? Stacy, take your clothes. Well, I said-- Now, not later, now. Yes, I'm still here. Is that them? Look, how bad does he have to get before you people will lift a finger to help him? Let me talk to those bastards. You have to be a cripple, helpless, and would that be sufficient for you? Well, look, it's just wrong. The suspect's first vehicle snagged right here about five miles south of the facility. Second vehicle was found up here about seven miles north. Now, what this leads me to believe is he's not interested in escaping. What this guy wants to do is wreak as much havoc in this area as possible. Now, as an aid to our investigation, Mr. Spenetti's psychiatrist, Dr. Allan Koosman, has prepared a profile for us to listen to, and I suggest you listen very closely. Dr. Koosman.t you listen Vincent's been institutionalized most of his life. He just spent the last ten years with us. His condition's classified as a conduct disorder. He's undersocialized and very aggressive. When he was nine, he was found half starved tied to a tree abandoned by the parents. The father's dead, as is the mother. You okay, mom? I'm fine. What's happening to us? Just a stage, honey. All families go through them. We're gonna get through it. It's gonna be okay. The main state will have it's own quarter as part of the commemorative point program. In Vermont the state wants you to design... Sometime next month, the bank is gonna to take our house. Let 'em take it. We'll manage. No, Scott. No one is gonna to take anymore of our lives. Put that away, Terry. We have been inseparable since we were seven years old. Now we're dying. No, we're not. When was the last time you laughed at anything I said? And when was the last time I said anything worth laughing about? Well, this afternoon, the floodgates will open. The Manataug River will once again flow free. This will be a great day for many outdoor sports programs in the tri-county area bringing campers, kayakers, and fisherman back into the region by the dozens. The opening is projected to raise the river's current water level by at least four to six feet. Look, I am not gonna to let us die here. I'm scared, Scott. I am so scared that one of these days we're gonna to wake up and we're not gonna to have the foggiest idea of why we ever fell in love. Now, I don't know if this is right. I just know that it may help. And I'm not going to lose you, I just won't. Do you know where that is? It's the rocks. It's where we used to play. It's fitting, that's where Tommy always told me how rich he'd be when he grew up. I think it'll take me about an hour. No, no. No, I'm going to do it. My brother stole the money. If anything goes wrong, I'm going to pay for it, not my family. Look, I am in it, too. I've kept these secrets the same as you. I know we got a problem. I know, the river. What are you two talkin' about? What's that? It doesn't concern you, Stacy. What is that? Stacy, honey, please just go to your room. You're talking about Uncle Tommy again. I heard you. What's that a map of? We don't know for sure, honey. You said Uncle Tommy didn't do it. We didn't know until we found the map in his house. That was two years ago. You didn't even tell the police? What good would that have done? Might have made people like him again. Stacy, the world, it doesn't--it doesn't work that way. Well, it's wrong. It's stealing. Look, we need the money, all right? No one is gonna to pay for your father's knee surgery. Now, in about six months, he's gonna be done walking forever. You really want that? Stacy, we know it's not right, but-- No, it's not right. It's not even close. Maybe we should rethink this. Scott, it's now or never. We can't change the river. I'm not quite sure what we'll need, so let's just take it all. Okay. This place will be crawling with people soon. I know, we better be quick. You okay? Yeah, I'm all right. I got 'em wrapped pretty tight, so. Remember when we used to come out here? Yeah, I sure do and we're gonna to do it again. What time is it? Ten o'clock. They'll start moving water out of the dam at 12. That should give us enough time. Everything around here floods, right? But if we don't do it now, we're going to have to wait at least a year. You lied to me, Uncle Tommy. Why did you have to lie to me? You all right, Terry? Yeah. You stay there. Oh, Scott, be careful. Oh, they must have blocked that off, huh. Oh. It must be down here. You can't go down there. It's all right. We'll just tie it off with some rope. Hang on, let me get this out of the way. There we go. Okay. Throw me the rope. Scott, Scott, Scott! Scott, are you all right? Ow! Scott? I can't stand! Oh, God. It's bad, Terry. Stay back! It's almost 12 feet down here. Look, I'll throw the rope down maybe you can tie it around your waist and I can pull you up. Go ahead. Okay. Okay! One, two, three. Pull! One more time. Okay, okay. Let me try again. One, two, three. Ow! O-o-ow! Ow. All right, look. I'm gonna go for help. What are you gonna say? Stacy was right. We could go jail for this. I'll get Stacy, okay? Maybe the two of us can pull you up. Good. Hurry. I'll be back in 15 minutes. Look, Scott, I love you. I'll be back. Just hold on. Oh, thanks. Hi, what's happening? I got car trouble. She says she has car trouble. There's a little store down the road. I was hoping maybe you could give me a lift so I could call my daughter. Says she needs a ride. Oh, please, it'll just take a minute. I don't know. We're kind of in a hurry. You know, the refrigerator broke and it's starting to get pretty stinky back there. Oh, please, please. I won't be long. Okay, come on around the side. Thanks. Come on in, come in. Make yourself at home. Sorry about the smell. Oh, that's okay really. That's my mom. Hi. We're kind of having a bad family day if you know what I mean. So, what the hell is wrong with your car? I locked my keys in it. Heck, I can fix that in a jiffy. I got one of those police gizmos. So, where is it, right down there? Yeah, but it's kind of rough. No sweat. Yes, ha-ha-ah! Yes! Look at this. It is a little rough, isn't it? Is that your car right up there? Oh, yeah. Whoop. My name' s Vincent. What's yours? Hey, is it something I said? Hey, is it something I said? Boo. Be very, very quiet. Ow! Terry? Are you gonna play nice or do I have to get pissed off? Just take it. Take the money, take the car, everything, just let me go! Promise not to tell? This is just like in the movies. Then I say "No way." Get in the goddamn car! No, please don't. Please. And I bring on the bracelets. Oh, this is great! Say it again, "Please don't." Please don't. Get in. Ow! Then I say, "Drive, baby, drive." Which way do I turn? Tell me where. What's your damn hurry, huh? I got you going, don't I, hmm? A little bit? You're not funny. Ain't that the truth? Hang a left, get on the highway north. And then you'll let me go? I'll probably just tie you to a damn tree. Shit. You drive like I do. Baby, I got a road map inside my head and this street ain't on it. You said the highway, this is a shortcut. Better not be a lie. [phone rings] Hi, mom? Sorry, not interested. Speed it up. There we go. Yeah. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! I love it. Oh, Tommy... Tommy. Oh, man. Hey Mark, check this out. Were these to control his mood swings? Obviously very effective. My sense is he probably he took off in this direction. That road borders a camp ground. He knows this area, Danny. This is not a random killing. Maybe we'll just get lucky, he'll kill himself. That's pretty sensitive. Sorry. It's all right. Let's get the media in here. We're gonna have to have all the help we can get. What time you got? What is with you and the clock? What? Do you have a daughter and a husband, a family? Do they like you? Yes. Yes. That was really weird the way you locked your keys in the car, you know. Yes. You oughta try one of these. It makes it all taste better. Stop. I said stop! Hey, man, wait up. Wait up! Hey man, how are you doing? Here. No way, I don't want it. No, this is for you. No, I don't want it. Check it out, man. Go away, I don't want it. Come on, take it. Look, I'm trying to help you ya idiot. What's a matter with you? What, are you crazy? Look, he didn't understand. Just drive. Now! We need gas. That sounds like fun. Ow! What do you got? Some witnesses down by the river heard a woman scream in the woods. Did you hear the one about the serial killer taking a woman into the woods? No. She says, "Mister, I'm really afraid." The serial killer says, "You're afraid? I got to walk outta here alone." A lot of car tracks here, Danny. Yeah, they're fresh, too. That means he's either on foot or in a car, but he's still in the area. I think we owe it to the residents of this fair community to warn them they got a maniac in their midst. I'll start the canvassing. [alarm sounding] * Finish up the canvassing and you get back in touch with us, okay? What the hell is that? Oh, it's the first, the dam let's out. All right. You got any money? And remember, I'm the husband, you're the wife, maybe we'll find a baby later on. Bonnie, why don't you go snag us some brewskies and bologna, huh? Mornin', pops. Well, well. You know, today has been one big impulse, so bare with me, okay? Twinkies, Suzy Q's, Twinkies. Sorry, I thought it was a bathroom. Oh, pumpkin. Hey, spot the cigars. I can't smoke where I come from. Gimme one. No, make it five. So where are you from? Insane asylum. Swear to God, my whole life. I mean, you'd have to pretty crazy to do something like this. You got a bag, pops? Why don't you just get the hell outta here? I want you to take the money from the register and put it in that bag, not the pennies. You keep the pennies. Got something big down there, don't you? So do I. Please, just do what he says. He'll kill you. Come on outside, spoiler. Look, just leave him alone. You start to sound like a broken record. Now go on, get! I'm just gonna tie up his stinky feet. I'm just gonna tie up his stinky feet. What the hell were we talking about? I win. Young and heroic, you're all the same out here. You don't give a damn about anyone, do ya? Please, help me! Oh, please. Help me, please. No, that one's mine. We getting loud now. Now, I couldn't hit bull in the ass with one of these things. You crazy? That's pretty obvious, ain't it? So listen, I'm gonna go inside and make a sandwich. They're gonna come and get you, you know. Honey, no one's gonna spoil my plans. Now come on, let's throw a party. Come on. Well, hello, missy. What happened to them? What happened to who? What are you doing here? Well, I came to collect a kiss. Do I get a kiss or not? Get over here. Hi, Uncle Greg. That's better. Where's your mom and dad? Out shopping. Your dad went shopping? I don't know. Would you buy me a cup of coffee? I need to talk you. Stacy, do you have a boy in there? No. Well, you better not. He's extremely dangerous, probably the most dangerous criminal we've ever had in this area. This morning, by the dam. That's right. That's why I want you to keep all the doors locked. I want you to keep the lights on outside in case he's around. What's this, a homework project? Yeah. Stacy, what's going on? You know, with all these gas fumes, you don't wanna do any smoking, okay? Can I ask you something? Shoot. Did Uncle Tommy steal the money? Is that why he committed suicide? Sweetheart, we talked about this. He did not commit suicide. He lost control of his vehicle. On a bright, sunny day? I don't wanna talk about this. Okay, he didn't commit suicide. Then why'd he steal the money? Can we just change the subject? Please? Why'd he do it? He always made everyone so happy. [beeping] * This guy is out near Rutland. It looks like a hostage situation. Stacy, even if your Uncle Tommy did do it, it doesn't make him a bad person. He shoulda made it right, but sometimes really bad things happen to good people. All right, I'll be back. All right, let's go. All right, we know he's got a shotgun at least. We don't know how many hostages. Shit. What? Is that Terry's car? Son of a bitch. Look, we don't know if she's in there. Besides, he doesn't even know who she is. All right, I need to have a sharpshooter on this building right here. I'm gonna keep this whacko inside the perimeter. Jesus Christ, look at all this gasoline? One spark this whole place is an inferno. I just wish there was some way we could tell whether Terry is in there. Why don't I just ask him? Hi, Vincent. I know you? No, I know you. I hear you're quite a guy. Dr. Koosman told you all about me, huh? Yeah. Hey, what do you say we call this whole thing off? How many people you got in there? As many as I need. Yeah, I don't have time for answers like that, Vincent. Haven't got time, period. What do you want? My shrink! Get Koosman in here right away and get that sharpshooter up on that goddamn roof, now. away and get that sharpshooter up on that goddamn roof, now. Mamori, get these cameras outta my face. Welcome to the party, doc. Thanks for coming. Right. What do you want me to do? I want you to get this psycho to surrender. I want you to get him to let these hostages outta there. By the way, one of these hostages, doc, is my sister-in-law. If this guy harms one hair on her head, I'm gonna kill him myself. You got that? I know. I'll do everything I can. All right. Look out. Like I said, I want you to climb into this guy's head and find that part of him that's gonna let these people go. Give him a telephone. What are you doing? Let me go. No, I can't do that, doc. Distance and strangers aren't going to work. Distance and strangers aren't going to work. Vincent. He doesn't wanna talk to you. Vincent, it's time to stop. Tell him if he talks to me one more time, I'll burn us up. He says his mother wants him to come home. He says his mother loves him and she's really, really sorry that she forgot where she left him and now she just wants him to come home. The paper. He wants you to write down all the good things about him so that his mother can read about him before they meet. Are you all right? He needs help. Do you have a family? Yes. I have a wonderful, wonderful family. I can hear it in your voice. It's a funny thing about people. We tell someone we love them, but then it's so hard for us to really understand what that means until it's threatened. I'm sorry, Vincent. Please, let these people go. She's waiting for me. We've been through this a million times. She wants nothing to do with you. She wants me. No, she doesn't. We have a shot. No, not yet. I can't tell what they're doing in there. Tell 'em to hold. Hold. I wrote her letters, letters that didn't come back. I wrote her letters, letters that didn't come back. These? They never came back because they were never sent. I intercepted all of them. Why? Give them to me. No. Listen to me. Your mother's dead. No, no! She's been dead a long time. I was planning on telling you when you got settled in your new home. Liar! You come with me now, Vincent. You come back home. You're a liar. Vincent! Vincent, stop. Stop, stop! Vincent, stop it! What do we got? Eden, what do we got? Nothing. Damn it, tell him to standby. All right, all right. Look, here's the deal. I will help you find her, all right? I will help you find her, but then you're gonna let me go, all right? No more stalling, okay? Deal? Deal? Come on. All right, all right. All right. What the hell is he doing? Koosman! Koosman, what are you doing? All right, this matter doesn't leave the perimeter! Nobody leaves! Second hostage in the backseat. Do we have a shot? You're not going anywhere, Vincent! He'll kill me. Let us through. Vincent! I will kill this lying bastard right now. Let us through. You will never get outta here! Do we have a shot? For God's sake, let us through. Do we have a shot? Affirmative. Take him! Oh, no. Stop firing! Hold your fire! Don't lose him. Get up here. Drive, baby, drive. Whahoo! How about that, Bonnie? Just like in the movies. We gotta stop. You put your foot on that brakes and I'll kill you myself. I am not going to die here! What the hell are you doin'? Bonnie, you got a whole other side of you, don't you? Bonnie, you got a whole other side of you, don't you? Hey, Bonnie, that was some ride! I just want you out of my life. Yeah, but we have a deal, bitch. Shut the hell up and drive. Contact with suspect has been lost. Repeat, contact with suspect has been lost. Damn it! All units, this is Marks. I want every cop in the state down here right now. I want every cop in the state down here right now. "Dear brother, if you're reading this then I'm probably dead. I want you to do me a favor. I want you to save our family. I don't know why I took that money. I guess I figured it was so dirty, what would it hurt? But now, I think I've triggered something, something most evil. Think of all the bad things that have happened to this family, all the hurt and pain. I know you've always laughed at my superstitions, but I believe I've cursed us all and I feel the hammer's coming down. It's gonna hit so hard it could destroy this family. I need your help, brother. I should've taken the money right back. I know, but I was--I was just too ashamed. And if you're reading this, it means I never did. Please, please do it for me and hopefully it will set right all the wrong I've caused." Is this it? You said you'd let me go. You're coming with me. You said you'd let me go! This can go as fast or as slow as you want. This can go as fast or as slow as you want. Oh, my God. Is this where she left you? I wrote her to tell her what was about to happen. I thought if she knew that I wasn't saved that-- I'm just so tired. I'm-- * Lady's got a secret. Lady has a secret. Oh, yes, she does. Oh, yes. You sure as hell don't want me, but you don't want them either, do you? You been bad? Yes. Yeah. Yes, I have. And now, all I wanna do is just tiptoe right out of it like it never happened. All I wanna do is just to go back home to my quiet little house, to my quiet little family and pretend like none of this mess I got us into ever happened. Because of me, my husband is hurt down by that river and it's starting to flood. And if he isn't dead already, he's gonna be soon. I don't care about him. Well, I do! I do. Look, we found some money, a lot of money. You can have all of it. Just please help me get him out. Not interested. All right, all right, all right. What about me? I bet I know something about you. I bet for all your big talk, you have never really been with a woman, have you? Oh, you've dreamed about it. You have thought about it, but you've never really done it, have you? Vincent, look at me. Look at my lips. Look at my body. I can make you feel things. I can do things for you, really. And you can do anything you want to me, just please let me go get him. You. You would let someone like me do things to you to save him? Yes! Yes. No! No! No, no. I'll save him if you say drop me. Do it! Do it! Why, Why? Because I love him! Vincent, I don't know what's been done to you, I don't, but I didn't do it. Please let me help him. Please. A lot of money? Yes, yes. You better not be lying. Ready, honey? We're never gonna make it. Just keep breathing. Jesus! No, don't do that. You got a better idea? No, thanks. Hey, we'll get him. Listen. Sorry about this morning. I forgot today was the day Tommy died. And that's a tough anniversary and I miss my baby brother. Sometimes two years can seem like two days. You gonna yell at me now? Is that what I do? Sometimes, when things get a little personal you get a little tense and send me on some asinine errand. How long I been doing that? Let's see, how long have I known you, 10 years? At least I'm consistent. Look, I know things had been kind of tough the last couple of years, especially on you. It's got to be tough on the family too, huh? Well, has it? Yes, yes, Danny, it has. Jesus, I'm like pulling teeth with you. All right. I didn't really mind so much that Scott stole that money then, you know. He had some harebrained scheme about getting some kind of a experimental treatment for his legs, you know, something to keep him on his feet. Tommy was Stacy's favorite uncle and I think the thing that put him over the edge was he really couldn't stand the thought of her pushing him around in a goddamn wheelchair. Today, Danny, genetics are a bitch. First Tommy goes down, now Scott can hardly stand up. Some mornings I get out of bed, I can feel the cartilage dissolving in my hip. I dunno how much longer I'm good to go. It's kind of hard to catch the bad guys when you can't run. Hey detective. Looks like we got him. He's practically down the road. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Oh! Hey, wait. Come on! Wait for me, dammit. Come on. Come on! I'm not getting in here. I can't swim. We've got to go faster. We are so close. Did you hear what I said? I can't swim. I'm not getting in here. Well, all right then, to hell with you. I'll just do it myself. I'm not getting in this boat and if you do, I'll shoot you. Well, all right then, just do it. I mean is that the best you can do with your life? Please. All right, all right. I get in the front. All right, there's only one way they could have gone and that's downstream. Take a look, go around the point on those rocks. This is a News Channel 5 alert. At this moment, police appear to be closing in on Vincent Spinetti, the man who is believed to be involved in the brutal slayings that took place at the Brandon Psychiatric Ward late last night. Spinetti has been spotted just below the Pine Mountain Dam. Please be advised, this man is considered to be armed and extremely dangerous. Hello, Stacy, is that you? Stacy? Say something. Where's your father? Shit. Hey, Marks to Eden. Eden, get everybody down here. I'm gonna go to the house. Terry! Terry! Terry, is that you? Terry! Hello, is anybody here? Hello? Hello? On the river? About 15 minutes ago. They're headed your way. Goddamn it! Don't lose her, Eden. You line that river. Don't worry. Let's move. Let's go. Let's go. Stacy? Stacy! Stacy? Stacy, open the door. Stacy? Stacy, answer me! Stacy! Stacy! Stacy, come back here! Stacy! Stacy! Help! Help! Scott? Scott, we're here. It's very scary in here. Okay, you got a rope down there? Come on, throw it up. Marks. Marks, come in. Marks! Detective Marks! Try again, honey. Okay. Come on. I got it. No, no. Tie that to the strong box first. Vincent. That's our deal. Come on, this water's flowing fast. Pull! Hold on, Scott. Tie the other end around you now. Okay, okay. You ready? All right. You got to help me. Come on, honey. Come on, honey. Get him on the side. Help him! I'm gettin' outta here. Thank your wife, man Thank you. Yeah, sure. Oh. Better get you out of this. Go! Go! Come on, honey, you can make it. Scott, are you all right? Thank you. I made a deal. Terry, who is this? Later, honey. No! Please, just let him have it. Look, you don't understand. We need the-- Scott, let him have it. That seems fair. Oh, oh, wait, Vincent. Wait, wait! What? You've had her long enough. Vincent, I can't go with you. It's my turn to have something in my life. It's my turn. It's all I ever wanted. And I'll put a bullet in his head if you don't come with me. No. You are mine. Come with me! Wait, wait! Stop! Stacy! Stacy! Vincent, no! Stop! Why do you care, huh? Vincent, stop! No, stop it. Your husband made a choice. He took the money. Now, I get you. All right. You want me so bad? Then you come and get me. Terry, no! Terry! Oh, goddamn it, Scott. No, no, stay down, Scott. Stay down. Stay down. All right. Are you okay? Yeah. Terry, wait. Help me, I'm stuck. He took her up there, but I can't climb it. I know, I know. She's all I got. I don't care if I walk again. I don't want the money. I don't want the money. I don't want it. Bonnie? This isn't a good game. Help is on the way, brother. Greg, save her. I will, brother. I will. Bonnie? Where are you? I guess this is what you call prophesaic, huh? I wonder what they'll say on my tombstone. Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie! I'll allow you to go free. Why did you leave me? Why? Terry? I'm sorry, Terry. Are you still my friend? 'Cause I can't play anymore. I gotta go. Would you help me? Please. Help you what? Vincent, just give up. You can go back to the hospital. They will never let me live, Terry, not now. Please help me, Terry. I can't shoot you. Vincent, please don't. Terry it's better to have your life taken by someone you love than by people you hate. So please help me. Vincent, I can't kill you. I just can't. You have lots to live for. Please. I have nothing, Terry. I have nothing. Why, Terry? Put the gun down, Vincent! Put it down! Get him! No! No, don't! Don't do it, Spinetti! I'm gonna do it myself. Leave me alone, you! Greg, don't! What? Drop the gun, Spinetti! Look at me, mom. Drop the gun! Here I come. It's all right. Mom! Stacy! Mom! Dad! There's something in there we all need to read.
