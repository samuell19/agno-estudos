So I got the volume way down, all right? These chicks... I mean, these chicks just start going at it, right? You know, like no top, just action. And your mom walks in. Oh shit, busted. Yeah, and she doesn't say a word. She's just standing there. She's just fucking standing there and staring at me. I wish we had cable. And all she can say is, you're up awfully late, Eric. So you get caught watching porn in your house, and you didn't get in trouble? Man, I would be so dead. Have you ever seen a naked woman, Brad? To the teacher's strike, 10 days old, no end in sight. You know what I like about this though, guys? It's that even if I want to go to school, I couldn't. And so Eric, you must fuck around all day. Thank you very much. No problem. That's real intelligent. Like that? And I probably won't even be here for the summer, so. Why are you doing that? Why would you go to school during the summer? I hate programs. Well, he wants to be a pilot. It does make sense. If that's wrecking my summer, then I'll wreck it. I'm going to be flying planes. What are you going to be doing? Anyways, we always go this place, right, guys? Yeah. It's our shack. Like our apartment. Without neighbors. Yeah, and if I wanted to, I mean if I really wanted to, I could even do this. Who's gonna say anything? Turn it down, please! No way! You're ruining a perfect good song! Yeah! Woo! Are you mad? Why? Why would I be mad? Just because I came home and the grass isn't cut, and you haven't picked up, or done anything you said you'd do? I should be mad? Sorry, I'm going to do it. OK. Has Jake been home? Of course not. What are you looking at? The mail. Did anything come? Like what? Dad, the test results, whether I got in. It's coming any day. Starting pilots out. Yeah, maybe. I pull a double down at the hanger. And I come home. And I see that Nadia hasn't picked up even a finger to help me around here. But that's OK. I'm used to that. But unless your school takes Monopoly money, you're working for me this summer, boy. You want to learn about airplanes, I'll teach you about airplanes. You can start with the engines. Dad, what if I get a bursary? What if you get a bursary? So what? What? There's no competition? It's just you? I just thought I'd try. Whatever. Well, I just want to try to be realistic. Sometimes, I don't think you're too realistic. Well, then I guess it's time for bed, huh, Dad? Hold it right there. Whoa. I don't appreciate this sarcastic smart mouth, all right? Know what you're going to do? You're going to go outside right now, and cut the lawn like you were supposed to. Dad, come on. It's 10:00 o'clock. Oh good, he tells time, good. Right now, I'm sick and tired of this conversation. Don't say one more word. Mr. Airline Pilot. Fucking piece of shit! It's so nice. I want it to stay like this. I need to do something with my hair. - It's boring. - You should try that. It would look really good. Maybe. She just looked at you again. What do you want them to do? This is a blood bath. Give me your change. Kyle? Get a paper, the page three girl is ridiculous. We're out of here. Wait. What? Nothing, just... You're looking at Megan, huh? Want to talk to her? What's the matter, can't think of anything? I don't know. Forget it, we'll just say hello, OK? Just say some bullshit. I mean, you know Megan. Come on. I'll help you. Hey, what's up? So, how's the strike going? It's OK. It's kind of boring. Yeah, I know. So are you guys going to Killroy's party? Um. Well, maybe, we don't know. When is it again? What do you mean? It's tonight. Oh right, that's right. I guess we're not in that loop. Well, we sort of made other plans. Yeah. Oh OK, well, whatever. Yeah, whatever. Well, see you later. All right. Yeah, see ya. Well, Bradley, you are the master of babes. - It didn't matter. - Mr. Smooth. He was nervous. You're a chick magnet, I'm telling you. Shut up. I'm in the loop. What the hell is the loop? Enough already. It isn't complicated. Brad, you're our favorite geek. Oh, thanks. Wait up. Now you're in the loop. Those are cool. Do you like them? No. So, what do you say, did you ask Megan out or what? I don't know. I don't think she likes me. So where'd you get the sunglasses anyway? We forgot the batteries. Good. Don't move! Whoa! Don't do anything, OK? We're just guys. Oh shit. Who knows about this place? Nobody. Yeah, no one. It's all right. It's cool. Come here. Get in here. Move it. Name's Luke. And, uh, I'm a cop. I was scared. I've been shot. It's empty. I'm in trouble. I'm sorry I'm in your place. I guess I couldn't move anymore. Do you need a doctor? No, don't do anything. We could call the police. Don't do anything. It's the police I'm running from. The cops that shot me. Now, just forget it. Forget it. You'll never see me again. Just do me a favor, keep your mouth shut. And don't tell anyone. Where did this happen? Who cares? He needs first aid. First aid? You got a Band-Aid? No. There's water. We could wash it and tie the leg up. Sure, water, right. OK, Brad, water. I can stay here, if you like. Sure. What are you, a pilot? What is this? I don't know. We're going to find out. Why did Kyle have to stay? Now we have to go back. I don't want to. Would you put the bucket in? Yeah. Kyle, is it? Give him something. I'm going to poke around in my leg, see if I can get the pieces of pant out that got shot into it. So let me get this straight. There's the cops, right? Huh? Cops on the take? Where am I? I mean, like what part of the world? Emsley, Ontario. Emsley? You live around here? Nobody asked us. How'd you end up already here? I drove, limped, crawled, puked my way up here. Your buddy has got my sunglasses. Oh, I'm sorry. Thanks. How is it now? We're gonna see. Oh, dirty bastard. I'm going to rip his fucking life apart. I'm going to do it slow. I don't think I can travel yet. It's all right, just stay here. Just a couple of days, boys. Get on my feet, I can get to a phone. There's a guy I can call. It's OK. Yeah, right, guys? Yeah, but after, I mean the getting shot part? Oh, here. That I don't know. It happened so fast. I'm with this dealer guy, right? I'm shaking him upside down, shaking the change out of his pockets. I see my friend Bruce. He's a Sargent. He's my boss. He looks at me. So I smile. Then he pulls his .38 out of his pocket, ping. That's I guess, the mechanics of it. So how did you get away? Through the window. I fell out. Funny, isn't it? I start shooting back, missing everything. Bruce is coming out. He's going to do the same thing again. Then I see this cab on the curb just sitting there. So I jump in. No way. I got a few days on him, anyway. But this pain is real. I tell you. Do you need painkillers? Or booze. Can you guys get rid of a car? Sorry. How old are you anyway? 14. So? It's just off the road. It's in a ditch. It's broken. It's just sitting there. Push it down a hill so nobody sees it. Sure, I guess. Then do that. Don't make a mistake. This is hairy. You guys might not want to come back. And that's fine. But just tell me no one knows about this place. Just us. OK. OK. I don't know if you've ever been in a real situation. But this is one of them. All I got right now is you guys. And I need you to keep your mouth shut. You're 14. That's young. Have you learned to do that yet? Bunch of bored kids, huh? This is rash. This is the rashest thing that's ever happened to us before. What are we even talking about this before? Why not just go home? The guy is a fucking fugitive, man. Great. I hate this. What? What do you hate? Yeah, hilarious, the guy said it was the police that are after him. So why don't we just not do this, OK? Are you even listening to me? No. Look at this thing. What does this say about him? I guess he was a little disappointed. Come on. He's a cop, Brad. We got to help him. We don't even know the guy. There might be accomplices. Kyle, the guy's been shot. He needs real medical attention. I mean, we could have a real doctor go down there. And no one would know the difference. What? look, you heard what he said, right? The only thing he's got is us... us three, our shack, our fucking shit, OK? All right? Let's go, Kyle. One, two, three. This doesn't have to be a big deal, Brad. We push the car, so what? Here we go, Bradley! Are you in or out? Of what? Yeah! Oh, man, look at it! Wasn't too shitty. Why so hard? I'm just saying, we need to talk about it. Blah, blah, whatever. Is he getting it? 40. All right, guys, let's just talk about life for a second, what do you say? School? No. We have a cop who's been shot with the gun. And he's hanging out in our shack. And he's like our guest. This is so weird. He's pretty hardcore. Oh, God, he's been in a gunfight, OK? We've got hopeless face over there in the liquor store. And those Kilroy guys, those Kilroy guys could not handle a situation like us. I mean, get the fuck out of here. What's wrong? Cop. Don't look at him. We're just guys hanging around and stuff, all right? We're just talking. Yeah. So what are you going to do tonight, Kyle? Think he knows anything? There he is. What's he doing? Simon, over here! Simon, you got it, right! Yeah, thanks. Big surprise. He's taking it. Come on, don't be an asshole. Just give us our booze. What are you going to do about it? Are you going to fight me for it? You want it, come and get it. I'll give it to you. Come and get it! Come on! What about you? What are you going to do about it? Let's go. Woo! Beep beep, you going home? Your dick head friend ripped us off. Tell him to give us our booze back. Simon, give these children their alcoholic beverages back. Catch, boys! I did my part. Listen, tell daddy I'm not going to be home for dinner, because he's on the rag, OK? Yeah, well, I'm not going home either. Whatever. That's a good idea. Let's motor. It just pisses me off. That's all. Why, do you respect the guy? No, the dick-headed guy, Simon. Do you respect him? No. Then what do you care? That's what he wanted. And that's what he didn't get. Forget all that. I got problems of my own. I miss my girlfriend, right? Right, Brad? Yes. Well, there I am, alone in the shack, middle of the night, missing my girlfriend, with all those naked girls you guys got pinned up all over the walls. So off I go, maybe it'll help me sleep. The problem, something must connect your dick to your thigh. Does anybody know about this? Brad. Well, it hurts my leg so bad, I've got to stop. I'm talking about my health, boys. - Sorry. - No, that's OK. Yeah, it's cool. Everybody does it. It's good for the country. Especially your age, when girls are illegal. It's like they're fucking paid not to like you. You see them in the hallways, with their new cosmetics. Where do you think they get the money? Kyle? What are you thinking about? - I'm just listening. - Come on. What are you thinking about? Come on, Kyle. There you go. A girl? She's cute. I got ESP. I see her face in the river. Did you tell her you were a pilot? Might help. Hey, we shouldn't stay out in the open, should we? I mean, because... If I can't fix things, I'll be living in the open. When you leave. When I leave, I got an empty gun. I'm the type of guy, I like you have a solution to the problems when they come up. You understand what I mean? Hit me. Your old man has a gun. Yeah, he's got a box of them in the closet. Why does somebody ask for bullets? To shoot bullets, at people. What are we, five? He's a cop, smart guy. He's got to have some sort of protection. So we have to get involved in it? Look, if anyone gets hurt now, it's because of us. Or you two, because I'm out of this. Wait. We'll just tell him we couldn't get it. What? Fine, OK, I don't really care anymore. Eric, I'm right. Eric, back to the library? Hi, Mom. Catching up with some school, Eric? What she doesn't know can get us in a lot of shit. Study hard? Yeah, chemistry is truly fascinating, Mom. We're proud of you, honey. Learn from the master. Want some chicken? One for Bobby, and don't forget Kyle. I couldn't stop going on it. Bobby, come get your supper. I'll see you later. OK, see you, Bob. You want to tell me why what? Besides that it's demented and stupid? Come on, you like it a bit. No, this is more of a you and Eric thing. What does that mean? Oh, come on, it happens a lot now. You and Eric have your thing. And I'm kind of isolated. That's what this is about? No, it's just that Eric's always yeah, yeah, yeah. And I'm always the suck. And who cares what I think? It's like he just tolerates me so he can hang out with you. I don't need that. I think you're making a big deal out of it. How? I mean, look at you and your dad. You're not at home. You're here. Why? Because your dad a jerk all the time. And you don't like being around him. Sorry. My Dad isn't a jerk, Brad. He's just being a dad. You know, I know it sounds weird. But that's just all it is. Wait and see if I get into that school. Yeah, you'll get in. Eric likes you. He knows you're smart. If you want to bail, then that's it. I won't go back. Fine. At this point, do I want to shoot anybody? No. No, we're just sitting around talking. So why have a loaded and cocked gun? So I push this, and out pops the cylinder. Then you use the ejector rod, right? Very good, the ejector rod. The most important thing I want to teach you boys is that you never, ever point a gun at anyone, or yourself, even if you think it's unloaded. You don't look down the barrel when you're cleaning it. You just don't do it. But for me, it's a little different. I'll do it, because I know that there's no bullets in this gun. I just know it. What are they going to do, pop into the gun out of nowhere, just by fucking magic? So I'm not scared, because it's bullshit, because it's an empty gun. Now, that's an example of what not to do. I did it this once to prove a point. It seems irresponsible. Stuff it. I wasn't always a cop. When I was your age, I was a crusty little so-and-so. When we wanted something, we didn't tell anyone. We just used to steal it. Bang! Are you sure? I talked to him. He's gonna do it. Come on. Let's do this. All I want to do is get totally pissed, huh? What should we get? I don't know. Speak up, what should we get? I don't know. There you go. Kids, fuck. I hate them. Excuse me. I think you boys had better leave. We're just shopping. Yeah, we're shopping, pal. He said you'll have to leave, or we'll call the police. Oh, relax, OK? That's it, Barney. Call the police. Yeah, Barney, could you do that for us, big guy? Hey, do you like this? Put the bottle back, sir. You don't recommend this one? No, you know what? I think that was a yes. Oh, good, it's a screw cap. Put the bottle back! One large pizza, vegetable, thin crust. Look at that. Oh yeah. You guys were born to get hard, I tell you. What do we got here? Goodies. All right, what puts the ape in the apricot... courage. So stupid. OK. Go get her. Hey, Megan. Hi. Um, do you want to... could you come here for a sec? Sure. So, how you doing? You ever asked a girl out? Me? Yeah. No. How about you? Kinda. Kinda? Um, I was just wondering, do you want to go out any time with me? Sure. Yeah? Yeah. She said yes. She said yes. She said yes! I'll talk to you later then. OK. See ya. OK. Oh hey, Kyle? DC-10 Delta, too easy. You're incredible. How can you see from that far away? Because he's got good vision. Dad home? Are you smoking, you asshole? I just started. I'm quitting now. You better bury those ashes deep, or dad will find them. What? - Move, fag. - What's this? It was in the garbage. Is that your pilot school thing? Don't look at me. I didn't do it. Hey, they didn't take you? Yes, sir. Yeah, I know about that. Yeah, I know that. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. What's your problem? Guess what? Congratulate me. We talked about that about 20 times, didn't we? Wrong, they didn't accept me. But you didn't know that, did you? Because you didn't even read it, did you? Kyle, I just didn't want you to be disappointed there, son. Oh, Jesus, thank you fucking so much, thank you. Be careful, mister. You were so sure, aye, Dad? I almost got him. They want me to take the test again. I guess that never happened to you, huh? Kyle? You know, you're like a professional fucking asshole. Kyle, come back. Kyle! Just keep on going, Kyle. What if he does that, and that suit gets rouged up a little bit, is that OK? Get. You a big man? You gonna shove me around? Oh, come on. You think I fucking care? Oh, what? Come on! Let's go! Hey, Luke? Don't worry. It's me, Kyle. I'm up here, kid. It says here to take the test again. Yeah. I don't know why I came here. For guidance. It's all right. I need guidance on how to get to a phone without walking. You want to be a pilot, I can't help you with that. I know that, obviously. Listen to me, no one cares. Your friends, they don't care. They're good guys. But they really don't care if you're a pilot. Your school, they don't care. Your family, it sounds like they want you to fail. So why care about them? Why care what they think? I don't know. No one cared about me when I grew up. I can tell you that. You know what I learned about the world? You do unto others. You eat what you kill. And that's what life is. You're not a cop, are you? Your friends say that? No, no one, just me, kind of. OK, listen, this is hard trusting you with this. You're running from police. I can't give you details. And I don't deserve to get gunned down, not for this. You have no reason to trust me, but trust me anyway, Kyle. I guess that means I trust you. Your friends don't have know about this. When I'm gone, go ahead and tell them. You can have a big laugh. Yeah, but they're good guys. You can't expect things from people, Kyle. Do you care about being a pilot? If you do, if you want something, you just take it. And then it's yours. That's it. That's it. You already got the jacket for it. Guys! Hey, I thought you were supposed to be at the library. I hate books. That's because he can't read. Guess what I got? I know where I am. Why are you telling me? Kyle, come out here for a second! What? That was a long time ago. Give me a break. I'm thinking tonight. Can you help me? Yeah, sure. It has to look like a break in, Brad. What was he supposed to do? Yeah, but your own dad's car? So, what's your point? I don't know. It's just... it's weird. It's something Jake would do. Jake didn't do it. I did it. He pissed me off. Fuck off, Brad! I don't care. Hey, hey, relax, OK, guys? All right? Wait, the battery. Can you hear me? OK, fuck you. Now, you hear me clear that time? Listen, you're cutting off? Betty? Betty? Hello? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! He just trashed your dad's phone. About 10 times. Sorry. This thing is busted. You boys stay out late tonight? Just get me to the road. I can't stay here. No problem. And a road map. I gotta swipe a car. This is it, boys. Look, you go with her any night of the year. Why tonight? Because, I'll be there, OK? I'm going to meet you. Bradley, Bradley, come on, you gotta come. This is the cool part. Hey, I don't want to go there by myself. Maybe. Look, you tell him. He doesn't listen to me. Look, I can make my own decisions, if that's all right with you! OK. Hey, I'll call you, all right? No, he's a fucking cheese sandwich. I mean, he sucks about this. He sucks about that. He sucks about everything. And now the bullets. He can't even protect himself. He isn't a cop, aye? Yeah, he told me. What? Don't tell Brad. He told you? Oh, we're in shit. Eric, could you come over here, please? You too, sir. We're dead. We're definitely dead. We're dead. What are we going to do? Just act stupid as hell. Look, the cops didn't even mention you. It's just that if they do, my parents will kill me. You know what? The store does he even know anything is missing, all right? - OK? - Fine. Good, now shut up. Hey, Luke, I got you a little present. Well, well. That's what I call good timing, little brother. What can I say? Thank you. No problem. So what's with these handcuffs, anyways? What? Oh yeah, right. That's kind of a strange question. I'm a cop. Yeah, of course. I know that. I don't understand how it's a question. That's all right. Sometimes the brain misfires, Eric. So, um, I'm probably going to be a writer, or a poet, probably a writer, because I think they make more money. Yeah, I'm thinking about being a pilot. Oh yeah? Do you fly? Well, no, but I'm going to school for it this summer out east, just single engine planes, no big deal. That's cool. God, I shouldn't have told you about the shack. Eric would kill me. Well, I'll tell you. Um, Eric already told me, at some field trip or something. That dick. Whoops, sorry. You want to go purple hazing? What? Ow, I closed them too tight. How's it feel? No, Luke, come on. They're digging in. You're a criminal now, right, Brad? Come on, Luke. Take them off. Nope. Ha ha, very funny. You know what? Whenever you feel, all right? I know. Maybe I'll take this key, and chuck it into the woods. Shit. Brad, did you see where it went? Brad! No. I'm sorry, bad joke. I wouldn't have thrown it. Give me some credit. Come on, take them off. Man, this hurts. I'm sorry. But this is purple hazing. OK. You're purple. You're totally purple. Everything is purple. This cannot be too good for your eyes. Nope. Oh my God. That's So terrifying. You hear that whirring noise? Yeah. That's the pilot. He keeps changing the power of the different engines to control the landing. That's so cool. You don't see many jets here. What? I don't know. You're so lucky you're going away this summer. I don't think I can stand another summer around here. I know what you mean. It sucks. It bites, is what it does. Here. Geez, I can't believe I'm out with Jake McLaren's brother. What do you mean? Nothing, it's just kind of a reputation. It's interesting, no offense or anything. I'm not like him. No kidding, dug. Want to know what else? What? You're really cute. Yeah? Yeah. Piloting. Kyle, take it easy. Sorry. It's all right. It's OK. I don't know why I did that. Well, why don't you just relax? Why'd you ask me about Jake? I don't know, so? Kyle, I really didn't mean anything by it. The pilot stuff isn't true. I lied. What? - So you made it up? - There's no school. I didn't get in. Kyle, I don't even know what you're... You want to know about Jake? He smashed my dad's car with a chainsaw. Funny, huh? Oh. You see, oh? You said, oh. Kyle, come on. Sorry. I'm a lousy date, aye? I had fun. Kyle! Kyle! What do you say we have a drink, one for the road? So Kyle, did you fool around with her? I don't know, kinda. Kinda? What did you do? He's 14. He had a date with a nice girl. He's on the right track. Time will come, he'll move on to bigger fish, like sis over there. So what do you say we start talking about the plans? Yeah, pretty soon. I brought the bullets. You're a good man, Eric. Well, here's to the wind at my back. It's going to be hairy. But I'm sick of this hiding shit. Kyle? Hello? - Kyle? - Oh, Kyle. Megan? Get the fuck up. Hang on. I'll come out. Hold on. Let her in. She's already here, right? Hi. Um, oh, sorry, maybe this isn't such a good idea. Maybe I should just go. No, no, no, come on in, stay for a while. Yeah, come on in, welcome, have a seat. Thanks. Hi, Megan. Hey, Eric. This is my uncle from Michigan. Weird, huh? - Luke, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. Kyle didn't, like, tell me to come here or anything. I'm just kind of crashing it. Hey, you're Brad, right? Yeah, actually we met when... So, what do you think? What do I think? Do you really want to know? Just being a smart ass. I'm just being a smart ass. Yeah, well, everybody is a smart ass every now and then. We wont' hold it against you, Megan. Hey, guys, I mean, I don't mean to cause any trouble. But since when do we let women in here? Good point. I don't know. Those girls on the wall there, they see welcome enough. They're different. Look what they're wearing. Yeah, no women, unless those women are wearing no tops. Eric, that's' so mature. Actually, Megan, that's the rules, right, guys? Those are the rules. Well, if they're the rules, I guess I better follow the rules, hey? Now, we're talking. Take it off. Whoa. I actually thought she was going to do that. Yeah, you know what? That's because you're drunk. And whoa... whoa, so am I. I just shouldn't have gotten up like that. What are you doing? What? Go ahead. Oh, you mean, take... yeah, right. We've outlined the rules, very specifically. Women have to take off their tops. Right, boys? That's pretty funny. Go ahead. Turn down the music, Brad. Why? Brad. OK, hold on. Are you some kind of pervert or something? Let's say we talk about something else, I guess. Yeah, yeah. No, you know what, Kyle? I think... I think I better go. OK, I'm just gonna go. Luke, come on. She's my friend. Sit down. Look at me, Megan. Look at me. Do you see how I'm not laughing? OK, what... what the hell is going on here? What's going on is we're going to have a little show. And you're the entertainment. Take off your top. Follow the rules. OK. Are you guys just going to sit there? Yeah, they're just going to sit there. They're waiting, Megan. Come on, man! You gotta learn to like this. Have you seen this before, Kyle, huh? Now's your chance. Take it off. Take off the last button, Megan. Come on. That's a good girl. Ain't she a good girl, boys? What the hell are you, man? Big secret fucking hiding place here. It's a fucking nightmare! You better get her back. What are you reading, Brad? Megan! Get away from me! Megan, stop, please! Go back to your pig friends, Kyle. I'm so sorry. I don't know. You just stood there. You didn't do anything! I should call the cops. No, no, no, you can't call the cops. I know we deserve it. You know what? Kyle, my friends were right about you. You're a big loser, like your whole family. Megan, I don't know what that was. Fuck off, Kyle. You guys happy now! That was the grossest... Where is she? Your friend caught me. What? Fuck. Eric, your face is all bloody. What your mom and dad going to say? It's OK, man. Just don't hurt us, please. Fuck! Now I gotta kill him! You had to bring that girl here. You had to bring the little girl here! Eric, you're not going anywhere, buddy. You're staying right there. You two, get a fucking car! Do it now! Do it! Luke, man. You messed up. You really messed up. You talk to that girl. And Kyle, if you call the police, I'll kill him. You hearing me? Yeah, I hear you. It's weird. It don't take long, do it? It's OK, Eric. Don't worry. Oh, fuck! Kyle, please! Kyle! Get the car! How do you know Jake's even there? Because he is. I just gotta get the address. We go there. We get Jake's car. We get it to Luke. And they let us go. Cop killer, that's funny. Funny. We have to call the cops. No, no way, he'll kill him. Right. Stop throwing your bike! Kyle. What do you think he's doing to Eric? Forget it, let's just get the car. Um, those guys will get the car. You don't have anything to worry about. I'm not really paying attention kid, sorry. I feel kind of shitty. And you probably wouldn't have to do anything, because you know we're going to keep our mouth shut, right? You taught us that. No one even knows about this place. What'd you say? Um, I said that no one even knows about this place. You little shit. Wait, OK, Megan. Come on, man. What do you think I said? Turn around. Luke. Turn around. Luke, come on, man. Shut up. Keep your face forward. Give me my sunglasses back. You don't deserve them anymore. I'm taking them back. Bang. Hey, idiot! Not going to tell you again, turn the music down! Oh, no! Blow me! That's it asshole, I'm calling the cops. Wait till those stoners go inside. There's Jake. Wait, they're going in. This is it. You sure you know how to drive standard? I've seen Jake do it. I think we're all right. Yeah? We did it. Turn it off! Turn it off! Oh God, that was close. Jesus! Come on. Come on. I'm trying. Come on. It's stuck, Brad. Shift it, already. I can't get into first. It's your brother, man. He's stealing your car. What? Oh. Jesus. Kyle, he's coming! OK, I got it! Kyle, go! Drive! Go! Come back, you fags! I know you can hear me, shit face! Stop that car! Run! Run! It's locked. OK, what are we going to do? Kyle! Little brother? Are you in there? If you are, come out, and I'll break every fucking bone in your body! No, I won't. No, I won't. Kyle? Why my car? Woo! Looking for a light? Whatever you're doing, man, I really... I don't care. So I guess you're not my ride? Hey, what are you doing? Don't do that. Look, my brother ripped off my car, he wrecked the gears. I just came down to burn down his shack. But forget it. What's your name? Jake. Jake, I want you to very slowly close the door. Shit. Luke. Shit! There's a guy out there on the ground. Go out there and drag him in here. Move it! Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Jake? You all right, man? Fuck! Yes? It's Kyle. Did you get it? Listen, not yet, but we're going to have it. Kyle, I'm going to open the door. Come in with your hands held over your head, OK? - Where's Eric? - He's here, OK. I'm opening the door. Is that your brother? He came here to burn your shack down. Nice, huh? Put your hands up. Listen to me, Kyle. He's in shock. And I don't know what's going to happen. I'm not a fucking doctor. I said I wanted a car. And Jake's going to bleed until I get one. And I want all of you back here when you do it. Why? Because I said so. Help me, Kyle. Help me. Help me. This is a lot worse now, Kyle. Cops would be really bad, for me, and for your brother. Now go on, get out of here, Kyle? I am not going back there. What the fuck happened? Where's the fucking car? Kyle, are you OK? We gotta get a car. We'll get my mom's car. - We'll get my fucking mom's car. - Kyle! He's going to kill him, asshole. He's going to kill all of us, asshole. Do you understand? Guys, I'm just trying to think, OK? You weren't there. He fucking shot him. Guys, I'm trying to think, OK! What the fuck is happening. I'm calling 9-1-1. We're getting the cops in here. You fucking think he wants to hear that? You think he wants to hear that? You don't care if his brother dies, do you? I'm not the one who brought the bullets now, did I? Fucking punk. You are very average, boring, stupid guy with a big mouth. And I don't respect you. And I never have. Fuck you, asshole. You think I respect you? Stop it! Just forget it! Guys, stop it! Fuck you. Just don't do anything. I got to go see my dad, OK? Fucking pansy. Shut the fuck up. Dad? Give me a break, will you? I'm on my vacation. Don't look at me like that. Oh, here, look, you got some mail. I guess you got in. I need help. I don't know what to do. I've been thinking, I'm going to kick the prick out. I can't even stand looking at his face anymore. That's it. I mean, you, you're not that bad. You show some promise or something anyway. But that kid is nothing but a zero. Maybe if your mother was still around. I don't know. Forget it. I got to go to bed. I got some kind of virus, I think. I hope you don't need money. No. No, I don't need money. Eric, you can get your dad's gun, right? What? Yes, sure, I can get it. What about your dad? Don't just say it. Don't say it to me unless you're going to do it. Yeah, I'll do it. Good. I gotta go there. I'm worried about Jake. Shut up. He's going to frisk you. No, one of you. You, just get me the gun. Get it to me while I'm in there, some signal or something. Wait, you're going to be the one, right? I mean, you're going to be the one that does it, right? Stop. Could we actually talk about something? You know what? We know what we're talking about, all right, faggot? Shut up. Kyle, do you actually think you can just go up in somebody's face with a gun? - I don't know, Brad. I don't... I don't know what else to do. No, Kyle, if you do this, you wreck your life. That means you wreck all of it. Don't be part of it. Just take it. Just take it. Use it. Use it. Fucker. Jake? Jake, keep it to yourself, all right? You're going to be OK, Jake. You're stupid, you know that? You're really fucking stupid. Why did you run? I told you to close the door, and you ran. Now, look at the position you put your brother, me, and you in. Yours is worse than ours, but. You. Sit there and wait. Jake's going to be OK. He'll be fine. Kyle, listen to me. I want you to sit there and wait. Try not to piss him off. At 3:30 exactly, I want you to kick over that lantern. Then we're going to come in, OK? Kyle, kick it hard. Yeah. This is your fault. It's Kyle. What about the car? We're going to have it. It's totally worked out. It's Eric's mom's, OK? We'll have it by the morning. Before the morning. Yeah, Eric's grounded. We got to wait, you know? I was hoping I could see my brother. So you wanted to spend time with the family? Where the hell were you? Shut up. Hey. Whoa. It's weird loading it. Yeah. Hey, careful, all right? I think I should have something too, for protection, just to have it. Why? What? Eric, I hate this. When we're doing this, we'll be doing it. I can't even imagine it. It freaks me out, man. Look at this. Shit. This thing is totally wrecked. Like this? What the hell reeks? Oh, God, what is that? The cop I told you about, that's where I got this stuff. He wouldn't let me go. I tried to change. Oh, shit! Oh my God. He wouldn't let me. He just keep pushing, and pushing, and pushing. So I shot him. I don't know if I regret it or not. Probably not. I tell you, Kyle, I can't wait till the morning. That's when they can get the car. What can you do? Wait, wait, fuck. What are we doing? Just relax. Oh my God. Did you fucking see him? Why are you looking at me? You're looking at me like, I don't know. I don't like it. You know what kind of people I hate the most? People your age. Not just me... everybody does. Ask him. Why do you think he came here? He came here to hurt you, to really hurt you. He did. Girls with their menstruation, you guys with your squeaky voices, and your sticky palms, and your little fucking problems. Pathetic. Wait, wait, wait. I can't do this. Relax. Relax. You hear that? I didn't hear anything. You better hope to God you didn't. How you doing, brother? Who is this guy, man? Don't worry, OK? Trust me. Look at you two, so young. Nothing just waiting to happen. And you don't even know it. So, got a real bright future, huh? Got big plans? Ballsy. That's Kyle. He's getting beat around. We have to do something. What? Wait, you know what? What if we call the cops. It's too late. Let's go. We gotta go. Come on. Stay down. You looking at your watch. Look at me, Kyle. I got a funny feeling. I don't think the car is coming. Why do I think that? Of course the car is coming. I'm not stupid. Oh boy. What? Let's find out, because this is pretty important. Besides, I want to find out what you're made of. We've got to climb the roof. Go on. I can't do this. You have to. He needs u. He needs us. You may have more than one chance at this. So think really hard. Is the car coming? Yes! Fucker, they're bringing the car! I can't do this! All right. Fucker. Fuck you. Fuck me? No! One more time, same question! Is the car coming? Luke, come on, man. The car is definitely coming. I'm telling you, yes! I'm going to shoot him, right now. No! The car isn't coming! Now we get the truth. You should have said yes again. Want to make another smart ass comment? I didn't think so. I'm wiping you clean. You're going to get a good close look at the dark. Now, that's a noise. Get over here. Fuck. Oh shit. Anybody there? Come on! So you had plans for me? Get up there. Jake, don't go anywhere. Go! Go! Now! Stay on him! Grab him! Hit him! Stop it! Stop it! Hit him! Stop! He's not moving! Look who's in charge now! See how this works, you motherfucker! Not so fucking tough anymore, are you? Kyle, Kyle, come on! Look at me! That's what a gun's all about, you filthy fuck. So what? Use it. Don't do it, man. Kyle. Use it. Come on. Don't do this, man.
