You Tube - Video Running Time 02:03:54 You Tube search name - Yasmin - 1955 Your Excellency, this slave has brought... a letter from Her Highness at the palace. A letter? 'My beloved, salutations.' 'You've been camping in the desert... for the last four weeks, away from the palace.' 'And here our son, Ahmed is involved... in merry making at the harem.' 'Before he commits any mistake... it's very important for you to return here.' Damn! This boy has gone crazy in the excitement of youth. Make arrangements for my journey immediately. Where is he? Where is that disobedient guy? That wretched and ungrateful boy who wants to ruin my honor... and put a stigma on my family's reputation. Speak softly. Ahmed is immature, but you are wise. That disobedient boy has taken advantage of my absence. Today he'll be punished. It's not wise to raise a hand on our young son. You should be gentle with him. Meaning? Send Ahmed away for a few days on business. During that time we'll arrange his marriage. And what if he doesn't change even after marriage? Why wouldn't he change after getting a beautiful bride? Look at this. See the photograph of your would-be daughter-in-law. - Is this the photograph of Amir Kasam's daughter? - Yes. - Amir and his wife are coming here tomorrow morning. - I see. Inform Ahmed of my arrival. Ahmed humbly greets his father. Ahmed, I'm very sorry to see that instead of giving me happiness... you're hurting me. Hurting you? In what way, father? To collect the tax from the citizens... I've been camping in the desert for the last 4 weeks. But you didn't feel it necessary to help your old father. - Is this your duty? - I'm ashamed of myself, Father. To amend this mistake and to prove your decency... you'll have to go to the camp right now. And the work which I've left incomplete... you'll have to finish before you return. Father, your soldiers can do the work of collecting the tax... from the businessmen better than I. But it's important that you go... to keep watch over the soldiers. As you command. - One more thing. - Command me. It's beneath your dignity to go... and flirt in the area around the camp. The inns and hotels there are very risky for decent men. As you wish, father. Ahmed will reach his destination before sunset. Oh, oh! Excellent! So, this is the place where father has imprisoned me. God is great! But what arrangements were made for my entertainment? The cool strokes of hot breeze! And the piping hot desert sand! - Isolation all around! - No fair lass or damsel. - Spend the day in sighing. - And the night in counting stars. Alright. I'll have to obey father's command. Where are the businessmen? Your Excellency, they'll meet you tomorrow morning. - What will I have to do now? - Please, take rest... or entertain yourself with the beautiful damsel. - Damsel? Where is she? - There. - Here. - Oh! I thought something else. Your Excellency has the disease of misunderstanding? But what can be done? I'm helpless. Enjoy this. Hey, bring my horse. Huh? Horse? Does Your Excellency want to return? No, I'm going to the nearby town. One of my friends stays there. That place is very far from here, Your Excellency. And it's forbidden for you to go there. But not to visit my friend. Then let's go. I'll also accompany Your Highness. No! No! No! Farid! Ahmed! What a surprise? You? Here? This is father's doing. He sent Ahmed to the desert to bring him under control. I got fed up there, so I came to your place. I'm very glad. Tell me, how can I serve you? Take me to such a place where... there are fairies, a gathering of damsels. I've heard the inns of your town are very entertaining. Well, they are, but coarse people gather there. If you wish, those fairies can be invited here. Then what are you waiting for? You have a seat. I'll make arrangements right now. 'My heart is in a dilemma. It is difficult in both worlds.' 'Somewhere there is a group of fairies... somewhere a gathering of damsels.' Oh, oh! She left. But my heart is missing. Control your heart, my friend. The entire city is crazy about her. I am one more admirer! What was that damsel's name? - Her name is Yasmin. - Yasmin? It's a lovely name. I'm telling the truth, Farid. I never saw such a beautiful creation of God before today. I have heard, understood and realized it. Come on, rest now. - It's very late at night. - No, I'll return. You'll return? At midnight? I'm helpless. I can't disobey father's command. Got it? Goodbye. Wife, what is the age of Amir Kasam's daughter? - Nadira is three years younger than Ahmed. - Praise thy Lord! Then they'll make an excellent pair. Have you ever seen that girl? - No. And you? - I've never seen her, either. Well, let Amir Kasam arrive. We'll fix this proposal today. Your Excellency... there's a messenger sent by Amir Kasam. A messenger? Present him. This slave presents his humble greetings, Your Majesty. Master lnaamdar has sent this letter for Your Majesty. A letter? So, he didn't come himself? Master lnaamdar was not in a condition... to travel due to sudden illness. Oh! I deeply regret the news of my friend's illness. I will pray to God for his long life. You may go now. - What will happen now? - We'll have to wait. We'll have to wait until Amir Kasam recovers. Kaif, why have they gathered here? Your Highness, they've come to greet you... and to pay the tax. I accept their greetings. And I forgive their tax. - Bring my horse. - Horse? You mean you'll leave again today? You're very disobedient. I'll complain to father about you. The Junior Prince has excused the tax. But His Excellency will hang us. Got it? I understood. I got it. You may go. Go! Go! Come on, go now! Go! Please come Please come, oh beloved The heart's desires are still unfulfilled Make me drink the wine of love Show me the way to live Come on, please come Who has called me? Who is waiting impatiently for me? Who is he? Darling, I'm here. - I'm here. - I'm here I'm sitting close to you And I'm lying at your feet Serve me goblets full of wine Oh beloved, make me inebriated Come on, come on, come on, make me intoxicated I've come to serve the wine of my beauty through my eyes I've come to hypnotize everyone With my alluring panache I've come to give you a hint I've come to arouse the magic of love in hearts Serve me goblets full of wine Oh beloved, make me inebriated Come on, come on, come on, make me intoxicated If I look in your eyes, my heart gains peace You love my each and every style Pick up the goblet. This world is no less than paradise Drink it so that you believe Serve me goblets full of wine Oh beloved, make me inebriated Come on, come on, come on, make me intoxicated He smiles and looks in my eyes He spreads over my heart like a soul My eyes have met his eyes today Oh God! I am going astray Serve me goblets full of wine Oh beloved, make me inebriated Come on, come on, come on, make me intoxicated Serve me goblets full of wine Oh beloved, make me inebriated Come on, come on, come on, make me intoxicated Oh Creator of beauty, hats off to you! May I speak with you in private? Come with me. What do you want to say? Say it quickly. I want to say many things. But I can't say them quickly. Oh Fairy of the Desert, your love has captured my heart and mind. And you are smiling on my lips as my love. I am indeed very fortunate. As a souvenir, I give you this ring. I accept this souvenir as a token of love. Show me a place where I can talk with you to my heart's content. The talk of love. Our camp is far from the city, near the old ruins. If you wish, I can meet you tomorrow night. Alright. We'll meet tomorrow night. Yasmin! My tribe's men are searching for me. I'm going. Remember the promise, okay? - I will never forget. Goodbye. - Goodbye. My eyes are impatient, my heart is restless This heart is crazy for someone. Really crazy When will evening arrive and when will the lamp be lit? And when will the lover boy reach there? The lover boy The garden of the heart is about to bloom Someone will surely be coming Tell the flowers and the stars... to decorate the lonely place secretly. That lonely place When the night baths in dew, those wavy tresses untangle The eyes exchange a secret One heart sings a song to the other. A song Let the colorful atmosphere spread Let someone come as promised Oh friend, tell me; what is this heart? I'll even give my life for her as a gift. As a gift My eyes are impatient, my heart is restless This heart is crazy for someone. Really crazy 'Beware of me. I'll give a punch and pop out your eye.' 'I cast a spell and throw the card. I astonish everyone.' Oh wow! I've won! I've won! Evil man, with whose permission did you touch the dice? I didn't take anyone's permission. I've won. - Return my money. - Before giving you any money... I'll bang your head, scoundrel. Enough! Stop! You both wait for me here. I'm going in those ruins. Yasmin! Yasmin! Yasmin! Yasmin! I was waiting for you. My heart said you'd surely come. Here I am. Sweetheart, did you have to wait long? - I really enjoyed this wait. - Really? I feel like taking you in my arms and getting lost in love. I feel there should be no one in... that world of love except us Settle in my eyes and reside in this heart Smiles in the stars and blossoms in the flowers Settle in my eyes and reside in this heart Since I've seen you, since I've found you... I've lost my senses. Intoxication is spread all over Now whatever you want to say, express it through your eyes Settle in my eyes and reside in this heart Alas! If only my throbbing heart stops awhile This night of love shouldn't pass just like this I still have to sacrifice my life on you Settle in my eyes and reside in this heart Destiny should never bring moments of separation now The destiny of love should shine like this every night Oh moon and stars, you pray together Settle in my eyes and reside in this heart Very good! - Chief! Chief! - Yes? What a nuisance! Here you're enjoying your life... and there your daughter was away from her tent the whole night. - What are you blabbering? - I'm blabbering nothing. It's the truth Your daughter is having an affair. Wrong! Absolutely lie! Night is coming. See with your own eyes. Alright. I will see. - Ahmed! - Yasmin! My beloved, my desire! My love, my world! I've been roaming in paradise the last 15 days. You've converted my dreams into reality. Still I can't get you. For how long will you test my patience, Yasmin? I'm not testing you. In fact, I'm trying to make my decision firm. A woman's heart is very weak, Ahmed. One needs courage to reach the destination of love, Yasmin. - Will you come with me? - I will definitely come. But after a few days. Come, let me take you to the world of love. Let's go there together. I feel the time is favorable for me today. The aroused desires in my heart... are impatient to be sacrificed to you. Come, place your head on my chest. - Ouch! - What's wrong? Do you want to win the game of love with your sweet talk or... Meaning? My innocent soldier, when I've accepted... defeat in the war of love, then why this pistol? Oh! I'm not a soldier. I've the heart of a lover. Here's the pistol. Now tell me, what will be the consequence of this love? Consequence? What do you mean? I mean that this is the call of destiny. Listen to your heart and climb this horse. Before dawn, I'll take you to a new world. A new world? How is that world? Much more beautiful that this world. The days are more colorful than here, nights are youthful. No sorrows, no danger. - Who? Who's here? - What's wrong? I heard footsteps. My ears can't deceive me. Who will come here on this dark night? Sit. Today I want to rest in your arms and ask the secret... of your beautiful smile and its long journey. Catch this scoundrel. He shouldn't escape. Now where will you escape? Leave me! Let me go! - Ahmed! Ahmed! - You go. To hell with you! Come here. - I won't go. - Come on! Move ahead! Go ahead! Take this scoundrel inside and tie him up. Today I'll get the value of his dead body, too. Pick him up! Come on. Shameless girl! Do you want to defame me? Go inside. If you'll step out of the tent without my permission... I'll break your legs. Come on! Shameless! Wretched girl! So, how are you, brave young man? You were very proud of your strength, right? Now your grandfather and father will have to pay... 1000 gold coins to see your face again. - Tell me the address immediately. - I won't. - What did you all do to Yasmin? - Yasmin? Foolish young man, do you think she loves you? To trap important victims like you... we use Yasmin as a golden trap for us. And her false love is a beautiful deception. Definitely a deception! By offering the lure of her fabulous beauty... she has brought many youths to these ruins. And I have buried them alive. Shame on you and your status! How did you dare? How did you have the courage? I'll teach you a lesson right now! Wait! Let me weaken his foundation first. I don't deserve to be called as Jafar if I don't trash you. - Will you tell me your father's name now? - No. - No? - Give it to me. I'll see how long he holds out. Wait! Let me sharpen his senses first. Move! Whip him so much, so much that he forgets Yasmin's name also. It will be so. Get ready, scoundrel. Now I will deal with you. Kaith, go and sit there. The beautiful deer wanted to escape from the clutches of the lion, right? Coward! Rogue! Don't touch me. Get out of here. I should leave? But before leaving let me tell you that... I've thrashed your lover black and blue. I'd have felt very glad if you had seen the drama... of his desperation with your own eyes. Heartless fellow! You're no man. You're the devil. I'll kill you. Devils have a very long life. Got it? He's fainted. Let him stay in this condition. Let's return. We'll deal with him tomorrow morning. Where are you going? Will your father guard here? But who will guard me? Shut up, you coward! Sit here quietly. Let's go. Everyone gives me orders, as if I'm their slave. Wretched fellows! Father! Father! Let me go! Leave me. - Father, save me! Leave me. - What's wrong? Look, this evil man is harassing me. Why are you harassing her? I'm not harassing her. I'm asking for my rights. You promised to marry Yasmin to me. Yes, I remember my promise. Go and mind your work. You always postpone it. You always postpone it. I'm fed up with your promises. I'm fed up because of you. Go inside. What a nuisance! G... ghost! Oh my God! Where are you running now, kiddo? I am not a kid. I'm the father of seven kids, kiddo. And I'm your grandfather, kiddo. What are you doing? Leave me. What are you doing, father? Is anyone here? Where are you hanging me, brother? - Father! Grandfather! - Shut up! Jamaal. Grandfather! I say, grandfather! Listen here... Grandfather! Grandfather, here... Where are you leaving behind your grandson? Hey Jamaalu! Hey Kamaalu! My father shouldn't know about my condition. That's why, take me to my friend Farid. The gigantic sky above. The deep hell below. Tirumal is hanging in between. You have done this wonder! Someone please come. Someone please come. He went hungry the entire night. Huh? What's this? The ropes are cut and the victim has vanished! The cat ate him up. I see! The cat? Why? Why are you hanging on the tree? - I'm guarding. - Wretched bat! Is this a place to guard from? Then what? A place to rest? What are you staring at? Get me down. Get me down. Tell me. Where are the victims? Huh? The victim? He vanished! Really? Then I'll vanish you too now! - Ouch! My hand! - Missed it. Wait, Kiddo! Where are you running? I say stop! Stop! Help! Help! Save me! Leave me. When he used to writhe with pain... the lover boy used to weep and say... 'Oh God, convert everything in this world into my lover girl.' So, Your Highness, do you see the consequence of falling in love? I didn't know that damsel was a serpent in disguise. And you wanted to marry that wicked lady, right? That time I cared for my family's honor. I will definitely take revenge with that betrayer. Those nights are no more Those talks are no more The moonlight of my love is lost My heart and its colorful desires are ruined My desires and life are ruined Those nights are no more I was unaware of myself and my heart My days and nights were intoxicated My head was on your chest every moment Such a beautiful state of innocence is lost Those nights are no more Those talks are no more The moonlight of my love is lost Those nights are no more The flowers have withered. The moon has disappeared Darkness has spread over everything As soon you went away from my sight... I lost my eyesight Those nights are no more Those talks are no more The moonlight of my love is lost Those nights are no more You've been mourning for a month. Are you grieving over your death? If you don't stop lamenting your lost lover... and don't forget him by tomorrow, I'll teach you a good lesson. Go inside. Wretched girl. 'Yasmin, come to your senses.' 'If you're impatient for your beloved, then be courageous.' 'Search for him in the city, the market, in the lanes and corners.' 'One who seeks finds God also.' You've been waiting for that disloyal girl for 10 days. - What do you intend to do now? - Revenge! Forget the 10 days. The fire of revenge won't... die in my heart even for 10 years. Forget about taking revenge, Ahmed. It is a brave man's honor to curb his anger. Look at these wounds. They're burning my heart like embers. I will definitely mar the beauty of that deceitful woman. But think about the consequence, too. If His Excellency learns about this, it will be terrible! I'm not afraid of the doom's day. Now no power in the world can change my decision. My heart searches for him I am searching for my heart The misguided travellers are seeking their destination They are seeking their destination I am searching for you. Oh flame, where are you? I am searching your gathering like a fire-fly I am searching your gathering My heart searches for him I am searching for my heart The misguided travellers are seeking their destination They are seeking their destination The world says the custom of love is strange In the desire for survival, one seeks for the killer The misguided travellers are seeking their destination They are seeking their destination My heart searches for him I am searching for my heart The misguided travellers are seeking their destination They are seeking their destination A storm of desires has awakened in my heart I am seeking the shore like a wave I am seeking the shore My heart searches for him I am searching for my heart The misguided travellers are seeking their destination They are seeking their destination Ahmed! Wretched girl, you're going astray again? Come here. I won't come. Leave my hand. Leave my hand. Ahmed! Ahmed! - I feel like killing this disloyal woman! - Jamaal! - Even Ahmed can take revenge on her. - As you wish. - Respected sir, how are you? - Fine. What's this? You're still grieving? Get ready quickly. People are waiting outside. Let them wait. I won't dance. You won't dance? You'll have to dance! - Will you leave or not? - Oh! How dare you! Very good! People are waiting here... and your daughter is sitting arrogantly there. She isn't ready? I'll see what can be done. Yasmin, are you weeping? What's wrong with you? I'm weeping over my destiny. I'm weeping over that destiny which... is ruined before prospering. You may kill me, father, but I will never marry Jaffar. Then whom do you want to marry? Yasmin, you don't know the tricks of the rich men. They trap girls in love to satisfy their lust, dear. No. He loves me truly. Can't you fulfill your daughter's desire, father? I can definitely fulfill, but on one condition. Condition? What condition? Until you get married, you'll have to dance gracefully. So that a lot of wealth is collected... and your marriage is solemnised in a grand manner. Father, I will make today's musical party memorable! Very good! Then get ready quickly. People are waiting. - You go, I'll be right there. - Okay. - Be careful. What if he comes here? - I've settled everything. If that young man tries to enter here, kill him! These iron hands are stronger than the lion's paw! Throw a glance at the damsels with a smile Love everyone who loves you These tresses, this beauty and these long arms The silent eyes which strike lightning If you're brave enough to watch her then watch Throw a glance at the damsels with a smile Love everyone who loves you No one falls in love deliberately One also gets desperation in love Sometimes give consent, sometimes refuse Throw a glance to the damsels with a smile Love everyone who loves you Settle every style of beauty in your eyes Awaken the storm of love in your heart Get rid of your misfortune Throw a glance at the damsels with a smile Love everyone who loves you I'm going inside. You wait for me here. - Why are you risking your life purposely, Your Highness? - Shut up! Oh, my, my! Your killing gestures strike my heart! I feel like sticking a knife in my heart. - Will you accept this necklace? - Definitely she will. Let him fulfill his desire, dear. Your father has recommended me. May I? I have converted you into a fairy from a woman. Now I feel like embracing you. - Ahmed! - The courtesan who sells her beauty in public! Is this your reality? I've lost my temper! Who is this ill-mannered fellow? Oh God! Catch him! Catch this scoundrel! He shouldn't escape! Catch him! Catch him! Where is he? Catch him! You escape from here. I'll try to stop them. Catch him! Catch that scoundrel! Catch him! Catch him! Catch that rogue! He shouldn't escape! Where have you brought me, Ahmed? - What place is this? - Come on! The wanton courtesan who exposes in public! If you want to dance, then dance before me. So I can bid the highest price for your alluring gestures. I think there's some misunderstanding. Please tell me the reason behind this animosity. If you try to come near me, I'll become very angry. I'm innocent, Ahmed. Don't misunderstand my love. Shut up! A deceitful lady like you is a blot on love! I understand your lures very well. What you are, the secret's been revealed to me. To snare innocent youths in your trap of love... and bring them to the old ruins. Your profession is expressing false love and looting them. This is wrong! Absolutely wrong! My love isn't false, Ahmed. Huh! How can a seductress and a deceitful woman understand true love? How many men have you ruined before me? How many have you killed? Tell me, how many men have you ruined? I'm not a cheat. I swear by you. I'm not a fraud. I don't deserve to be called Ahmed if I don't... beat you to death. I swear by the power of my arms, I can finish you in a snap. What is Ahmed! And what is Ahmed's anger! You won't forget this for as long as you live. If you hate me so much, then why did you bring me here? To take revenge for these healing wounds. An eye for an eye and life for a life. That's my family's custom. No, no! You can't do this. You can't do this. The way I was whipped, the marks of my hunter... will remain on your body till doom's day. Move! Heartless man, I didn't know you were a vampire in the disguise of a man. Vampire? Don't forget, you're imprisoned... in Prince Ahmed's tent right now. You can't escape from here. Nor do your well wishers have the strength... to snatch you away from my custody. Why don't you pity my condition? Remember this! A helpless lady's tears will ruin you! Like the rose petals blowing in the breeze... your lips shivering in anger look so beautiful. But your magic won't work now. Because you're disloyal. Don't ever dare to run from here. What is this after all? And who is this woman? And why has Junior Prince brought her here? You're still immature. And this is the matter of lovers. Forget it, you won't understand. If His Excellency comes to know, he'll shoot both of you. Shut up, coward! Let me sleep. 'Pray for the success of our love.' 'Pray that our world prospers.' 'Pray that morning never arrives in this night.' 'Pray that we won't separate even after death.' 'Ahmed!' 'Yasmin is our golden trap to entrap innocent victims like you.' 'Yasmin is our golden trap to entrap innocent victims like you.' Ahmed! 'Yasmin is our golden trap to entrap innocent victims like you.' Ahmed! Zubeida! Zubeida! Where are you? Your Ahmed has become very disobedient. The job I sent him to do, he left unfinished... and he's been camping nearby for the last 10 days. And I had specially forbidden him. It's possible this is false news. Ahmed would never go against your orders. You're a mother. Being helpless as a mother, you want to hide his wrongdoing. But I will definitely punish him. And what if this news is false? Then I can embrace him and pamper him too. You must remember well how dear Ahmed is to me. I used to pray all night for his recovery when he was sick. But that doesn't mean he does whatever he wishes. Your Excellency, there is a messenger from the camp of Junior Prince. - He's brought important news. - Present him. Salutations, Your Excellency! Live long, oh Great Emperor! This slave offers his humble greetings at your service. Where's Ahmed? What's he doing? What his excuse? Tell me! Junior Prince returned to his tent last night after 10 days. Did you hear, Zubeida? Did you hear his misdeeds? Speak further! Speak further! My tongue doesn't permit me, Your Excellency. This slave can't dare to complain about Junior Prince. Carry out my orders. Tell me clearly. Junior Prince has forcefully brought one dancer to his tent. What's that? That miscreant has gone so far astray? That disobedient boy has gone so against me? Zubeida, Ahmed has aroused my anger. I'll give the severest punishment to that offender. No, no! It's not right to become so angry. You'll have to be more careful, beloved. We have to learn the reason behind young son's revolt. I'll see. I've not become so weak yet. I behead whoever goes against me. Get the horse ready immediately. Today it's the first war of love and duty. Pray for my success. Goodbye. I'm alleged to be a betrayer Oh Love, have mercy on me I'm alleged to be a betrayer He has decided to commit cruelities against me I have the courage to bear the sorrows To destroy the happiness like this... To destroy the happiness like this. To make it perish Today he has taken an oath Oh Love, have mercy on me I'm alleged to be a betrayer Tell me when you separated from my heart Say that you are upset with me You only say this with justice You only say this with justice. Please say Who has really been disloyal? Oh Love, have mercy on me I'm alleged to be a betrayer I accept your atrocity I agree to all your deeds I don't regret if I die, when it is the matter of love Oh Love, have mercy on me I'm alleged to be a betrayer Forgive me. Forgive me, cruel man. I beg of you. I plead before you. Set me free. Listen to the request of a helpless lady, Ahmed. I'll give you blessings. I can see your pride is bowing. The straight neck is bending. But remember, neither your tears... nor your appeals will have any effect on me. I thought you were a nice man. But you're stone-hearted! Foolish woman, a heart deceived in love... doesn't becomes stone but iron! Now none of your plans can be successful. I requested you. I begged for mercy. I was ready to place my head at your feet. But you didn't take any pity on me. I hate you. Hate you! Hate you! Today, you've spoken the truth for the first time. I will kill you. After all, you revealed your real identity. But your delicate wrists don't have the strength to kill Ahmed! Why doesn't God's fury descend on you? - Junior Prince! Junior Prince, he has arrived. - Who? Where is the disobedient one, that stubborn boy? The one who considers it beneath his dignity to come to greet me? Your Excellency, dear father. Your son presents his humble greetings. Ahmed, you dared to be absent from the tent... for 10 days against my command. What's the reason? I was sick, father. That's why I traveled to my friend's home for treatment. If you were sick then why didn't you inform me? Why didn't you return to the palace? I didn't want to disturb my father... by informing him of my illness. Nor I was strong enough to undertake such a long journey. How surprising! You couldn't come to me... but I could come to you. What was wrong? I had a chest pain. But I'm absolutely fine with your blessings. I want to understand the truth. Tell me clearly. I've told the truth, Father. Ahmed would never dare to lie in front of his father. Hey, why are you eavesdropping? Come this side. Hey? What was that sound? Who else is in this tent? Only this parrot, besides Your Excellency and me. - It was the parrot's voice, father. - Oh! So this parrot yells also? The African parrot shouts more and speaks less. To hell with you! You have bitten deep. I'm a wild cat. I will scratch your face. - Whose voice was that then? - The parrot. - The wretched one is shouting in spite of being full. - I see. The parrot! - Put that down. - No! I'll shout. I'll make noise. Don't try to fool me, Ahmed. You've forced a dancer into this tent. Why? With whose permission did you bring her? Answer me. It's my business, father. - Please don't try to interfere in this. - I will. Tell me what relation you have with this dancer? Don't force Ahmed to disobey. I can't tell you. You can't tell? Offender, you are revolting against your father. You'll have to tell me. I do want a reply. If you investigate further, I'll lose my temper, father. I have more temper than you. I smash the bones of a lion in anger. For God's sake, leave me alone. I beg you. I didn't know you were so disobedient. The hands which always prayed for your long life... those hands can strangle you to death also. Father, can I get a chance to prove myself innocent? I didn't bring this woman to this tent because I love her. In fact I want to take revenge from her. Eye for an eye and life for a life. It's you who taught me this lesson, Father. - See these wounds! - Huh? What do I see? Who gave you these wounds? Who gave you such a severe punishment? This deceitful woman is responsible for this. But I'll make deeper marks on her face. It's not right for a man to raise his hand against a woman, son. If you want to take revenge, take it from her supporters. I'm ready to support you. Father, you've made my intentions more firm. I'm ready to carry out your order. Then send this woman back immediately. Father's wish is my command! You please return. I'll send away this woman and be at your service before sunset. Well said. You'll be glad to hear Ahmed... that we're making arrangements for your marriage. Thank you. But I'll be happier when... - father gets me the bride of my choice. - May Allah will! This will happen. Goodbye. A narrow escape! His Excellency attacked Junior Prince like a furious lion! Alright. The lion has returned. Now your prince will also return. What? The fire of revenge has cooled down? It's against my honor to take revenge on a woman. Oh God, give me strength to... forget Ahmed's love. I should erase him from my memory. I should forget him now and forever. 'I have committed sins because of you, oh sweetheart.' The root cause of all the troubles in the world is woman. - It's the truth! - Alright. You'll have to escort Yasmin back after I leave. - And give her these gold coins too. - Gold coins? Go and get the horse. I want to be in father's service before sunset. Prince Ahmed, you're doing me a favor by setting me free. What is your command for me? I have forgiven you. Be thankful of your beauty, which is stopping me from punishing you. Goodbye, Ahmed. At least you took pity on me. But why do you want to send me back to that hell? You belong in that hell. A dirty fish can survive only in dirty water. No, I won't return now. Don't separate us, Ahmed. Your plentiful tears are worthless. I've lost all respect for you. Remember this; you will surely repent after I go. If I stay near, I can surely change your hatred some day. I can rid you of your doubts. Then you'll have mercy on me. You'll learn to trust me like before again. One who trusts a serpent can't change her nature. You're still wicked. Ahmed, if you ever tried to understand the reality... you wouldn't have made this allegation against me. Those rogues made their money by using me. Seeing me falling in love with you, they poisoned your ears. Don't try to deceive me again after deceiving me once. Now Ahmed doesn't trust any woman. You've misunderstood women, Ahmed. A woman even sacrifices her life to prove her loyalty. A woman can cross the vast sea with the support of love. And thinking this, I fell in love with you. Move away! A wicked lady like you has lost my trust. - Now you'll have to return! - No, no! I won't go. Don't hurt my feelings, Ahmed. You'll reap what you've sown! You're a burden on earth. I pray that you'll be punished for this atrocity Your heart's condition should... be like mine Oh heartless beloved... Oh heartless beloved, you'll also have no peace Your disloyalty will make you miserable Oh heartless beloved... You also spend the night of separation in desperation You also remember the past times Your disloyalty will make you miserable Oh heartless beloved... Your love will suffer agony Your youth will weep Each sigh will come as a complaint on your lips Your disloyalty will make you miserable Oh heartless beloved... You will be deprived of all your support No one will be yours Like me, you also feel pity on yourself Your disloyalty will make you miserable Oh heartless beloved... Ungrateful girl, you're cursing my master? Come on, get up! We've set you free. You're setting me free after making me helpless? Fear the fury of God! Be thankful to your destiny that you have... gotten permission to return safe and sound. Or you'd been shattered to nothing in the desert. Take these gold coins. Junior Prince has given the price of your deception. Huh! To hell with these gold coins! You mean I should keep them? Thank you. Thanks. Thanks. Come on, get ready quickly. I will, make arrangement for a donkey ride for you. A donkey ride! Oh Lord, is this the consequence of true love? Though he may change... my heart will always be desperate in his memories. Hey? My ring? Hey wicked girl, where are you hiding? Look at this! I'm looking for her there... and she's trying to hide under the chair. - Come on, get up! - Wait. Let me find my ring first. Instead of the emerald, my heart is studded on it. Huh! To hell with your heart. Get up! Come on! - No! No! I won't go. - Come on. - I won't go. No! No! - Come on. No, I won't go. Come on! Sit on the donkey quietly. Come on! Ahmed greets his mother with respect! Ahmed! My darling son! My dear child! So you've arrived, son? Very good. I'm proud of your uprightness and graciousness. If you're proud of him, then find a pretty bride for my son. - No. I won't marry. - Why? Won't you fulfill our desire? What's the use of doing the work which will be a failure? Just forget this thought. Right now there is a need to heal his wounds. If Allah wills, Ahmed will surely like Nadira. Your Excellency, Amir Kasam and his wife have arrived. So, Amir Kasam has arrived? He's arrived at the right time. I'm getting a ravishing beauty as your bride. We're arranging your marriage... with Amir Kasam's daughter, son. Mother, is it necessary to speak only of marriage? It will be better if you leave me alone. Listen to this carefully. You will have to fulfill our desire. Mother! 'Remember this! You will definitely repent after I go.' 'You will definitely repent after I go away.' 'You will definitely repent after I go away.' I used to pray day and night to God for the safety of my friend. Please be seated. Thank God you have recovered. This is due to the prayers of Your Excellency. I consider it as God's blessings. I wanted to ask something for a long time. But I don't understand whether I should... ask you or sister-in-law? Don't embarrass me. It's you who have provided everything to this slave. This is your humility. Actually I want Nadira's proposal for Ahmed. Nadira is also a slave of Your Excellency. Who can dare to refuse you? Then what should we think? You all have equal right on Nadira, like us. If Ahmed likes Nadira, then we accept this proposal. Ahmed will happily approve my decision. Get up, wife. Play the music of happiness. Make arrangement for a splendid party. We'll celebrate our Ahmed's engagement grandly. Congratulations, sister. Congratulations, brother. - Hearty congratulations to you also. - Serve sweets, serve sherbet Will you congratulate them only formally? I'll bring it now. Wait, mother! Ahmed? Come, son. Greet your uncle. - Ahmed offers his humble greetings. - Bless you, son. I also want to say something about the finalized deal. - Deal? - Sure, sure. Tell us happily, son. If I won't hear from my future son-in-law then who else? I'm sorry, uncle. I'm not fit to be your son-in-law. - What did you say!? - I'm telling the truth, father. Put me in hell if you like, but I don't agree to this marriage. You don't agree? But why? It's my wish, father. Your wish can't be God's wish. - Go and sit there quietly. - I'm going. But before going I'd like to say... I won't be able to do right by your daughter. - Do right? - Yes. If you're hurt by my refusal, I'm ready to apologise. Ahmed! Ahmed, what's wrong with you, son? I've gone crazy. But I don't want to ruin anyone's life. I didn't know you were so disobedient. Get out of my sight. Ahmed offers his last greetings to father. Now this disobedient son will never dare to confront you again. - Ahmed! Ahmed, please stop, son. - Let him go! I don't want such a disobedient child. My friend, I'm ashamed at this wretched boy's deed. And I apologise for this trouble. Yasmin! Yasmin! Yasmin? 'You had only one souvenir of my love.' 'And you've left it behind, too?' lt'd have been better if you'd erased... your memories from my heart lt'd have been better if these tears gave relief to my heart You should have taken away my desires and my hopes too You should have snatched your beautiful visage from my eyes lt'd have been better if more darkness had spread in these eyes lt'd have been better if you'd erased... your memories from my heart You never believed the love of my heart When you committed cruelties and when you hurt my heart... it'd have been better if you'd killed me with your hands lt'd have been better if these tears gave relief to my heart Forget me as you forgot my memory If possible, then return my sighs and my love lt'd have been better if I found my peace again lt'd have been better if these tears gave relief to my heart Why are you sobbing now? Whom are you complaining about, weeping like this? Foolish girl, I will make you mine forcefully. My arms are very strong. Your strength isn't enough to win over a weak woman. Oh! We'll see! I've created such hatred against you in that young man's heart... that he'll never accept you. And I also told him you express false love... and trap victims for us. Oh! So, this hatred was aroused by you. Because you are mine! Only mine! You have insulted my innocent love. If God wills, you'll die a miserable death. Stop your nonsense or I'll ruin your life! Jaffar! You're busy talking here... and we have to return home before sunset. And you wish to leave this damsel here? Come on, get up. Get on the donkey immediately. You go and make the other preparations first. - I'll handle her. - Oh, oh! Okay. Why? Have you come to your senses? Keep lying here! Come on, get on the donkey. I'll load the luggage and return. Do you see their brutality? Ahmed considered me disloyal and rejected me. But I'm thankful to God that you heard everything. If possible, then go to Ahmed... and tell him I'll try to forget him. This knife will be useful in cutting your ropes. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Get my horse immediately. Master! Jamaal! From where have you come in such a bad condition? What's can I say, Junior Prince? Following your command... I was going to leave Yasmin. Suddenly those rogues attacked and tied me up. And they've kidnapped Yasmin. That unfortunate girl is back in the same hell. Yasmin told me that day. I'm missing her very much, Jamaal. She was also desperate for you, Junior Prince. But the truth is, Yasmin didn't deceive you. What are you saying, Jamaal!? God has revealed the entire secret to me. A rogue named Jaffar was haughtily telling Yasmin... that he created the hatred against her. Junior Prince, I swear by these feet. That girl is totally innocent. And she is very loyal. Enough, Jamaal, stop it! Yasmin is really very loyal. Now no power in this world can misguide me. Master! Junior Prince! Stop! I will also accompany you. Bring the horse. Jamaal can't wait to sacrifice his life for his master. And I can't delay in informing His Excellency. Bring one more horse immediately. To get the child we fulfilled oaths at the shrines. That same child grew up and offended my feelings in old age. Alas! If only we had strangled Ahmed as soon he was born. Beloved, it's necessary to control your anger. It's our fault after all. Before fixing Nadira's proposal... we should have learned Ahmed's wish. If you want to know Ahmed's desire, then listen carefully. Your darling son has fallen in love with that courtesan... and he wants to ruin the reputation of our family. This is wrong! My Ahmed can never do this. You're mistaken. This mistake will become a noose of death for me in the future. If you want your safety, forget Ahmed completely. It is easy to say, but very difficult to do. Ahmed is our only son. You don't know a mother's love. My anger is more intense than your motherhood. I will definitely bring him under control. I will bring an end to his dirty love with my whip. Your Excellency! Your Excellency! There's a messenger from Junior Prince's camp. The messenger has arrived again? He must definitely have some bad news. Present him to me immediately. Your Highness! Great Emperor... for God's sake please help Junior Prince. What new trouble has arisen now? Tell me immediately. Junior Prince is totally trapped in that dancer's love. Instead of returning to the palace he went to her instead. Oh! I am fed up with that wretched boy! What does he want to do? He wants to risk his life and get her. Before he gets her, I will behead that disobedient boy. Get my horse immediately. Lovers taking the first step in love... take each and every step carefully This path is difficult. This goal is trying You also don't gain pleasure like someone One finds nothing but disaster in love What did I get by sacrificing everything in love? Don't be influenced by your heart Take each and every step carefully Don't ask anything about loyalty Don't ask anything about my mistakes I never considered my killer as my killer Take each and every step carefully Lovers taking the first step in love... take each and every step carefully - Wow! Fantastic! - Excellent! Well sung! - Superb! Very good! - Fantastic! Wow! - Praise thy Lord! Well sung! - Live long. Praise thy Lord! - What a performance! - This girl is mind blowing! Ahmed! Oh Allah, what do I see? My beloved, why did you come here to lose your life? Leave immediately. If anyone recognizes you, they'll kill you. I'm not a coward, I'm brave. And I've come here to you, risking my life. It's not right to invite death without thinking, Ahmed. They won't let you live. To sacrifice myself for you is called life. Please forgive me, Yasmin. I misunderstood you. Misunderstanding is the first sign of love. But now, now I don't consider myself fit for you. Return back. And try to forget me. I can never forget you, nor your loyalty. You are that pious woman whom I could not value. I don't have any complaints against you. I just have bitterness with my destiny. The ruined destiny prospers after a long time. - I'm going. - No, no, you can't go. Now I can't live away from you for even a moment. - Speak softly. Someone may hear. - I don't care. I can give up my life but I won't return empty handed. So the victim is trapped on his own. Don't you dare to move! The weapons of death that are present here... I will sacrifice them on the new guest. Get that scoundrel! Catch him! Catch him! Catch him! Catch him! - Ahmed! - Come with me. Come from here. Be careful! Help me! Ahmed! Ahmed! Help! Ahmed! - Ahmed! - Father? Don't you dare come near me! Today my anger will fall on you like lightning. No, no! You can't commit this injustice without knowing the truth. The sword in my hands can't go back to the sheath... without beheading the culprit. Culprit? I've not committed any crime, Father. You fooled me and hid your dirty love from me. This is your biggest crime. My love is sacred, father. I want to marry Yasmin. Marriage? And with a belly dancer? So you're angry because she's a dancer. Everyone is equal in love, father. I've risked my life to get her. Don't think your way is clear after defeating those rogues. A big stone, a strong mountain is still barring your way. Ahmed can't disobey you. This girl is very loyal. I command you for the last time. You have to leave this girl. That's impossible. I can give up my life but can't leave Yasmin. You dare say this? You have the courage? - I'll kill you. - No, no. I won't create enmity between father and son. Please let me go. Leave me, Ahmed. If I'll leave you, a storm will arrive in the world of love. Father, please have mercy on me. You can't get this girl without defeating me. You can't regain any honor without sacrificing blood. Take your sword. This lion-hearted son of a lion-hearted father... can fight against your entire army. But it's not right to use the sword against his own father. Now I'm empty-handed, father. And this is the reality, that it's against my honor... to live without this girl in this palace. If you can save the honor of the family by killing me... - then I'm ready for it. - No... I won't create a stigma on my name... by killing an upright and brave son. I consider this defeat as my honor. Your true and sacred love has melted my rigid heart today. And let the world say anything, I will embrace you. Father! - I didn't know you were so brave! - Thank you. Father, where is my sweetheart? There she is! Go and stop her. Now your way is clear. Yasmin! Yasmin!
