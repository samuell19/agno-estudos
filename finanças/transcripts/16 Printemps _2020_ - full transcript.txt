SPRING BLOSSOM She has a sort of intellectual side. With Gautier, it's always kind of weird. Hey, you know who I saw the other day? - Grenadine and lemonade? - That's for me. Thanks. You didn't tell me what happened with Théo. I don't know, I asked her but... Sorry, I have to go. You guys are so naive. Bye! Bye, Suzanne. I can't believe David. - You're the naive one. - No, I'm not. - How are you, sweetie? - Good. I think I passed Italian. Could you help me with biology? Exams are next month and I'm not ready. Sorry, I've got my own stuff to do. Ask Léonard. - What are you guys doing today? - I'm working. I have school. I have meetings all day. See you later. Have a good day! Bye, sweetie. You serious? We have a math exam. Is the weather okay for a boat party tonight? Who's this guy? Just a friend. But what's this about a boat? - It's a boat on the Seine. - I don't mean that. Where did this boat and boyfriend come from? - You have exams in one month. - I know. That's why I need to chill. Where are you off to? A classmate's party. Even though she's kind of a pain, it could be fun. This is new, you usually never want to go out. I want you back by 12:30 AM. - Mom... - What? You're the prettiest of all. 1:00 AM? 1:00 AM. - Bye. - Have fun. I have no authority over my daughters. Hi, Suzanne. Hey. What's up, you usually never come? I don't know, I felt like coming tonight. - I thought it could be fun. - Sure. - Who has the code? - I do. - You go first. - Thanks. 3rd floor. Ground floor. You like beer, don't you? You almost stopped breathing to drink it all. I don't like beer. - It's boring. - What? I don't like beer! It's boring. You can have mine if you want. Which boys do you think are cute? I don't know. Go on, rate them from 1 to 10. It's horrible to rate people from 1 to 10. If I really had to do it... I'd give everyone a "5." Excuse me, was there an accident? No, his scooter broke down. Thanks. What are you doing up? When an engine leaks, is it serious? I mean, can you repair it or do you have to buy a new scooter? What tool do you repair an engine with? I have no idea. It can't take more than 10 days to repair. Well, good night. Raphaël! I've been thinking of Éraste's role. We're not up to par. We need to bring the level up. Your acting needs to mark people. I want you to stand out from all the Érastes in theatre history. You need to give it more soul or something. Come on. Back to work. THE CONSTANT PLAYERS I'm going away with friends in July. - Great. - You are? Yeah. Girls, we're going out tomorrow night. To the theatre? No. Why, should we? I don't know. Since you're cultivated... I thought, "Oh, they're probably going "to the theatre." You know, for culture. I don't know. Maybe another time. - When? - But not for culture. No, not especially. But not tomorrow? No, we already told you. "Sailors for their sport, ensnare The albatross, "flying with languid sweep..." Oh shit. "For their sport, ensnare "The albatross, flying with languid sweep "Sea-bird companion... "companion soaring on the air." Do we have strawberry jam? Yes. Can I have bread and jam? - This goes in the back. - Over here? What's wrong, Mr. Merlin? You seem pensive. I'm out for a stroll. When you're out for a stroll, you ignore those who greet you? I'm absentminded on my strolls. What way is that to talk? I dare say, you are impertinent. One second... Raphaël, I'd like you to come centerstage. You don't have lines, but I need your presence. In the center, please. I want you to be a tree, Raphaël. Start over, please. What's wrong, Mr. Merlin? You seem pensive. I'm out for a stroll. When you're out for a stroll, you ignore those who greet you? I'm absentminded on my strolls. What way is that to... Why am I a tree? You can't be a tree. I don't understand. I don't feel comfortable. That's because you're a wobbly tree. A weeping willow. I want you to be... an oak. A big oak tree. Take it from the start. Raphaël, an oak tree! What's wrong, Mr. Merlin? You seem pensive. I'm out for a stroll. When you're out for a stroll, you ignore those who greet you? I'm... Raphaël. That's no good. That's not a tree. This makes no sense. I'm not in this scene, right? I'll come back for my lines. Good. Excuse me for interrupting. You can start over. Do you have a light? I'm not sure you really need one. Your cigarette is already lit. Haven't I seen you here before? Yes, I... I walk past the theatre on my way to school. - What's your name? - Suzanne. How old are you, Suzanne? Have you seen the play? I'm sixteen. And no, I haven't seen the play. But I might see it soon. I often eat at that cafe. I'm 35. I went to school here when I was little. Well, not little... when I was your age. I like the area. Yeah, I live close by too... with my parents and my sister. I like the area too. Come and see the play one night. Uh yes, and... Are you happy to be in this play? I mean, do you enjoy it? I love the play, but... we've performed it so often, it makes me dizzy. Every night, the same lines at the same time. Do you like school? Do you enjoy it? I didn't like it much. But now, I'd be happy to go. I'm tired of everything. The guys and girls at school. My teachers. My routine. I'm bored. Tell me... Do you like girls better in skirts or in pants? I don't know. Answer me. What if you had to choose? I think I prefer skirts and dresses. You see legs. But I like pants too. Hey there... It's late, shouldn't you be in bed? Tomorrow's Saturday, I can sleep in. Go to bed anyhow. Good night. - Here. - Thank you. That's a pretty color. What? It's... grenadine and lemonade. Do you like it? I love it. Waiter. - I'll have a grenadine and lemonade. - Sure. You like to read? Yes. Do you only read novels or other things too? I read novels. But I read other things too, like plays. And... I like poetry too, but not all the time. Do you like to read? Depends on the book. I don't read much poetry either. Here you go. Thank you. Is that a good novel? Yes, it's good. Well... Bye. Bye. Shit. Damn it. Suzanne! - How are you? - Good. I'm coming home from school. Nothing special. You never sound very excited about school. I told you, I'm bored at school. I'm bored with people my age. What are you looking at? I'm just looking at you. And I understand. - Are you going out tonight? - No, I have school tomorrow. At what time? 9:00. Okay. Breakfast tomorrow at 8:30. Alright. I knew you'd say yes. I've seen you walk past at 8:30. See you tomorrow. Bye. We're going for a drink. Want to come? No, thanks. Why not? Because I have to get up early. What for? To have breakfast. Suzanne, are you crazy? It's 8:20 and you haven't had breakfast. I'm not having breakfast here. See you tonight. - Mom! - What? Do you have 5 euros? Yes. I think so, take a look in my wallet. Thanks. Good morning. Morning. Waiter, please. Two orders of bread and jam, a grenadine-lemonade and coffee. Thank you. How are you? I'm fine. Then me too. Do you like music? - Yeah, a lot. - And classical music? Yes. Hang on. Don't move. Do you want to hear a beautiful opera? It's the overture of the play. In this play, I'm tired of my lines, the troop, and myself. But never this music. Glad to see you. Me too. I didn't see you this morning. I didn't see you either. But I looked. Want to take a walk? Sure. Hello. A pack of Gauloises Blondes. 8.50 euros. I'll get that. My first present. You look pretty with colored candies. Thanks. - Bye. - Have a nice day. Knock, knock. How's it going? Good. Real good. I was wondering if you'd like to join us for dinner tonight? Does Marie know? Of course. It's nice of you, but I'm not free. Why not? Because I'm busy. I'm meeting up with friends. We're going to... a mega party. I'd rather die than miss it. If you change your mind... you're welcome to come. Raphaël, sorry to bother you. Do have a throat lozenge? Look in the drawer under my jacket. No, too bad. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow... Christine. Raphaël, you coming? I can't right now, maybe later. Will you join them later? No. It was a polite way of saying no. I don't understand a thing she says. Do you? Like I explained earlier, the Christian religion ruled over part of medieval Europe. With Cassidy it's the same. All he does is shout. I don't understand a word. The Bible regroups texts inherited from Judaism. Early Christian communities appeared in first Century Judea. Hey, do you think Judea has anything to do with Judas? I don't know. They spread the message of the founder of Christianity, Jesus Christ. I don't get something. Was Jesus Catholic or Jew? Because it sounds like he was both. I don't know. In the Middle Ages, Christian believers were governed by men of the Church. You think Jesus really lived? Murielle, shut up! You okay these days? Yeah. You seem miles away. Lost in your thoughts. School's okay? Boys your age can be dumb. Yeah, they can be. Bye! You came on your scooter? I need to go to the theater later. My parents would kill me if they saw me on that. No way, I'm not getting on. Besides, I don't want to. Come in, Raphaël. I'll be done in a second. Have a seat. I'm afraid. I'm afraid I don't know how to act anymore. You're tired, that's all. Have a chocolate. It helps everything. Have a chocolate. Hang on, don't move. What'll it be today? A grenadine and lemonade. Coming up. I want to be... I'd like to be an accountant. No, honestly, I'd really like to do that. The cafeteria food is totally gross. May as well eat Jell-O. I'm the set designer. The guy in charge of designing sets. I designed the sets. It wasn't as easy as you might think. When you see a set, it looks so simple and easy. But in fact... it requires thought, you know. You see, for this play, I wanted a semi-vertical, semi-horizontal layout. Oh, right. Verticality represents Man standing. Man walking. Life. And the bench, which is horizontal, represents horizontality and rest. The Earth. Telluric values. I don't know anything about this. What a shame, it's interesting. Everything is done in mahogany. I love mahogany. It's a precious wood with many qualities. But its main quality is that... it's red. It's a red wood. And I love the color red. Red... Red is strong. It's a symbol with power. I hesitated between red and yellow. Lemon tree wood is nice too. But in the end, we painted everything white. To contrast with the actors' energy. After the first rehearsals... I knew it wouldn't work. Then out of the blue, I had this idea... of the screen. What's its meaning? Maybe you noticed that the screen is green. Green? Green. An unlucky color in theater. Normally green is forbidden on theater sets. The man in green, The Misanthrope by Molière. But I think it adds... It adds spice, even if it's green. Yes, sure. It's funny, the mahogany is red... like spice. But in the end, the green adds spice. I've designed three sets at this theatre. Three sets, great. Suzanne, René wants to see you. René? Oh yes, René! Of course. I have to go see René. I'll see you later. What are you doing? Are you okay? Sure, and you? What's going on? Nothing. Just making sure everything's cool. At 2:00 AM? Sure, everything's fine. We're great. I had a stomachache earlier, but it's gone. Well... Great. Goodnight. Honey... she's really acting weird. She still doesn't sleep nights? I'm serious. You have a new beauty spot. I'll give it to you. Can I help you? No, I was just walking past. What's wrong? What's wrong? I'm fine. But I need to calm down. What's going on? I fell in love with someone. I fell in love with an adult. And he's in love with me too. Are you alright? You seem elsewhere. I know, but I don't want to be. You seem elsewhere too. No. Elsewhere I'm bored. I have to go. - I'll walk you. - No, I have to go. - That's it. - Cool, school's over. - Where are you going? - I have my piano lesson. Bye, Suzanne. Bye. I hang around on city streets An apartment, a party Wanting for lasting impressions A boy, and summer holidays I hang around the square Wearing an impudent white shirt Wanting for something to happen A boy, and summer holidays I cry all alone in my room A bed, a poster and the years I know I will grow up someday Oh boys and summer holidays Adaptation: Julie Meyer Subtitling TITRAFILM
