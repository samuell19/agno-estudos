Is that me? It's me alright. OK... Is there sound? So I can prepare myself. My legs are shaking. There's sound. I filmed as they were charging us. I started filming really fast. Live from Rennes. That's great, motherfuckers! I remember trying to get up. When I saw this, I realized I wasn't trying to get up. For several weeks, some people, - I'm not saying you - completely sincere people, have expressed their convictions. But some decided to infiltrate and distort that. They have destroyed, threatened, assaulted the police. Meaning the people who defend you. Your words "repression and police violence" are unacceptable in a constitutional state. My name is Marie-Laure Leroy. I'm at the hospital, and I don't know what time it is. I obviously havent slept. I'm the mother of an injured... Your mother? Fuck. Mr. Macron, while you're being clever in some gym, soliloquizing hours on end, because you clearly enjoy talking alone... Meanwhile, your henchmen, Mr. Macron, are mutilating our youth. Those young people presented no risk. How many more mutilated youth will it fake before you realize that leading a country does not mean perching atop the verticality you praise. It means leaning toward people, and really listening to what they say. I'm not angry, and bear no hatred. You are worthy neither of my anger nor my hatred. I'm just sickened. THE MONOPOLY OF VIOLENCE "The state claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force." Max Weber. It's funny, because... It was at the heart of my first book. It was what I was criticizing. Weber doesn't discuss the monopoly of weapons, the state has that. He discusses the monopoly of legitimate physical force. He was seeking a way to link violence to its legitimacy. So it's a game of scale, of proportion between violence and the legitimacy of using that violence. What are you doing? You are crazy! For us, the United Nations, the state has the monopoly and the legitimacy of maintaining public order. But does that make the violence legitimate? That's another question. When the French government claims there is no police violence, though testimony, videos, and images exist; when we're told violence is legitimate in response to violent demonstrations, that's when we get to the real question. Come! Wanna use your non-lethal? Where are you going? They're looking for us. You can't shoot like that! - What's with you? - Nothing. See you! Stop! Open up! It's open! Stop! It's not me! It's not me! I would say legitimate. Legitimate. Maintaining public order is among the fundamentals in Max Weber's "Politics as a Vocation". It's an old text, from 1919, that examines violence in the balance of power. It was inspired by Trotsky, who said the state is based on force. Hannah Arendt disagreed. For her, the consubstantial principle of power isn't violence or force. It's different. This policing system, its approach to law enforcement, and the orders given, are inherently political. What's at stake is politics. It's politics vs. politics. But everything we see in the speeches is depoliticized, as if on the one hand... It's either: "Those horrible demonstrators break windows, so we reestablish order." And that removes the political. Or it's: "Those bad cops!" But all of that is political. We have to repeat that this system, this practice of [aw enforcement, is a political choice by the government. To arms citizens! Form your battalions! March, march! Our job is to make sure you don't smash anything, whatever your motivations. Whether you're far right, far left, far center, a millionaire, or working class, that's not the issue. Do we let you riot and ransack, do we let you bum people, mutilate or kill people? Yes or no? The legitimate power decides. To maintain order you protect institutions, before businesses and individuals. - There's a hierarchy. - Absolutely. Demonstrators might feel insecure, thinking: “The police aren't here to protect us." The police are there above all to protect institutions. We're in a republic, but a monarchy would be the same. We're taking the street and we'll be right there Motherfucker! The Arc de Triomphe is the symbol of the Napoleonic Empire. It is the very symbol of consecrated violence. Its state violence. Shields everyone! Shields! We have an image of a monument that celebrates a revolutionary uprising with police running after demonstrators demanding the right to occupy the public thoroughfare. It is a fundamental difficulty for a republic to break from its revolutionary roots. The gilets jaunes surged into that revolutionary mythology. It's very active! They mobilize resistance to oppression, for the right of insurrection. Everyone is struggling with their own republican mythology. With a very conflictual logic, and one of breaking away. No cause justifies attacking law enforcement, looting businesses, burning public or private buildings, threatening passers-by, or defiling the Arc de Triomphe. Those guilty of that violence don't want change, they want chaos. They betray the causes they claim to serve, and manipulate them. They will be identified and held accountable for their acts before the law. When people say the police use legitimate force - if it's proportionate, absolutely necessary, etc. - that means it's a legal use of force: the police can lawfully use force. There's a confusion with the political notion of legitimacy, which is the moral right to govern granted by the citizens to the state. And that's different from lawfulness. That's the problem now in France. The Minister can say. It's legal to use weapons that are classified as weapons of war even if they are not always deadly. It's legal to use those weapons, so there's no problem. I'm not shocked that the state needs the monopoly on violence. It's a condition of democracy. It's a condition of shared well-being. It's a condition of a modern republic. What makes democ-tatorship, mistrust and a logic of suspicion take hold, is when the legal is erased in favor of the illegitimate. What's at stake here is that the legal violence of the police is increasingly crippled by a suspicion of illegitimacies, in the plural, the multiple. Those illegitimacies have been piling up for decades. Guys, be careful. Get out of the way! I cant believe it. Go for it with your truncheon! Get out of here! Get the fuck out! That's enough! Fuck off! There have been a few rare moments in history when a country has had what we might call - I don't like the expression - "a republican police." That means there are times when we accept not the verticality of power but its horizontality. That is to say we're united because we form a country, a political community, but we're divided because it is the very nature of democracy to admit social division. Division in pluralism, in the multiple. So if we accept that, police should serve the multiple, be the guarantee of the multiple. We confuse the state and the police because the police is national. In most other countries it isn't national. So in France, that facilitates confusion between the central government and the central police. It's an error of interpretation both historically and geographically. The police developed with cities, not with the state. "Polis" means city. In France, the police became the national police via a nationalization carried out by Vichy in 1942. That's the origin of the French national police. It's a reinterpretation of the history of the local police. What we might call a republican police is at the service of the people, not of the state. Can I have your number, please? Try directory assistance! Why are the plates...? Nice move! I hadn't noticed that. Incredible. Their number plates are hidden! Incredible! Why are the plates hidden? Fucking incredible. The police force is clearly becoming increasingly politicized. It's the state's fire brigade. But I don't think the police should serve the state. We must disconnect the police from the authority of the state. I'm a judicial police investigator, and my boss is the Minister. You're defending the rich and Macron! Only the rich and Macron, nothing else! Shame on you! You beat us up in 68! Our brothers protested the war in Algeria! They would have beaten you up! You spend your lives beating the shit out of everyone who demonstrates for their freedom and their social rights! You're parasites on the nation, nothing more! All of our social rights... You defend the privileged and the bosses, that's all you do, nothing else. Not anything else! In 40 you served the Germans. That's what you did historically. Go ahead and make a fist. Shame on you! That's a nice yellow vest. I'm a gilet jaune! But not that kind of gilet jaune. We're not on the same side, ma'am. That is exactly the verticality of power. He is in the camp of authority and force and she is not. The illustration is exemplary. You OK? - He's bleeding! - Medic! Call them. We cant. Right, you've got your hands full! Fall back! He's bleeding... It's not the role of the police officer to know if there's state violence, if people respond with violence... No. We live in a republic, not a totalitarian regime. There's no hold-up of power, whoever you may have voted for. We serve the Republic. You say: "We live in a republic, therefore we respect order." But my question is much more fundamental, and you could ask it yourself in terms of ethics and deontology. "What order do the forces of order protect?" The tall guy with his am up, that's my husband. It's definitely him. He's six foot six. I'm next to him, or maybe a little ahead. You're all alone, man. Why are you doing that? Nothing at all. All I remember is the blow. And then my husband in the distance saying: "Mell What happened? "Get up! Mell" That's all there is. Motherfuckers! See what you've done! Clear the way. They award the violent. They give medals and bonuses to the most violent cops. So only the state has the right to be violent. It's violent through its police and through its reforms. When it reforms housing benefits, it doesn't affect the richest, it affects the poorest. They get help to pay their rent, because they subsist on basic welfare. The prefect in Amiens said that if no emergency housing is available, it's because asylum seekers are in the area. That's violent. It's violent hearing that. It's violent to see people who've always worked scrounging in bins. It's violent to come to Paris where people sleep in the street beside merrymakers having drinks. That's violent. The French state is violent. Their words and reforms are violent. The response is violent. They think we're violent? So? What have you done for us? The employment bonus? Seriously? 60% of minimum wage workers qualify. That's violent. When the president announces: "I'm raising the minimum wage 100." Liar. It's violent to be lied to by your president. To those who focus on the violence of rioters, who criticize the violence of demonstrators, I'd ask them to criticize the violence of the state, too. When our dear president says there's nothing that cant be fixed in what happened to the gilets jaunes, that's not violent? My cervical vertebrae will never grow back. Ever. Neither will Antoine's hand. What you've lost, you'll spend along time fighting to get it back. How long does trauma last? One year? Two years? Ten? A hundred? To the end of our lives? That's violent. Waking up 8 times a night in a sweat, that's violent. Being afraid is violent. I was never afraid before. It's violent. Only the state has the right to be violent. When we respond to that violence, we go to jail. We risk losing our children. We risk our jobs, our lifestyle. Even if our lifestyle isn't great, and I'm in the red by the 10th of the month, I still don't want to be in the red by the 2nd of the month. Yes, only the state has the right to be violent. Or at least it's legitimate. If we quote Hannah Arendt, the power has to be legitimate. There is no legitimate force without legitimate power. That power must be based on consent, on shared values, on shared interests. When whole populations are marginalized, in an increasingly unequal and harsh system, power loses its legitimacy. Power must come from the community, from consent, based on shared values. Where are those shared values now, when the economy no longer obeys elementary principles of humanity? But that's a problem of a political nature. We accept, as citizens, being subjected to such violence. But in exchange for greater safety. - That's the deal. - I agree. - It's what we call the social contract. - It's Rousseau. And what happens when we no longer have that safety? When the state no longer protects us? Not just physically. The right to safety isn't just physical protection. In time immemorial, maybe. It's also social, it's also about health. What happens when one protagonist no longer respects the deal? Does it still have the right to be violent? - Holy shit! - Are you OK? Wow! You've got a huge hole! How big is it? How big? Damn that goes fast! Ill show how many people are here. What's that weapon you have? I filmed a policeman 15 minutes before the impact. We asked: "Flash-balls aren't allowed anymore, are they?" He said: "It's a non-lethal LBD40." He saw I was filming. It's much more precise. - Why are we getting hit in the head? - Simple. We're not gonna wait to get hit! It's just human! Someone shoots at you, you don't say. "Go on, shoot me!" Recovery position! Put her in the recovery position! Should we call an ambulance? Yes, call an ambulance! I don't recognize my own country. And they are the leaders. They run the police. They should take care of the people, yet they give the orders to mutilate. Carrying out those orders is bad, too. I imagine the guy who's there to feed his family, who's stupidly doing a job when he's aiming at me, and who hits my eye, knowingly or not. For him it's about his conscience. I don't know if he thinks about my face blowing up in the evening, as he kisses his kids. I forgive him. It helps me. It keeps me from... indulging some hatred that would ruin my spirit. But those who give the orders, and who know they're leading their troops to commit slaughter... I cant forgive that. Some people use as a pretext that they speak for the people. But which people? How? They are in fact only the mouthpieces of a hateful mob. When they attack elected officials, law enforcement, journalists, Jews, foreigners, and homosexuals, that is simply a negation of France. Throughout the gilets jaunes demonstrations, we have heard declarations in the media, and from a whole range of voices, describing the crowd in animal terms. It's old rhetoric. Of the French Revolution, Gustave Le Bon said that a man in a crowd only listens to his passion, loses his reason, and deep down he becomes a ferocious beast. Those images are revolting. That horde, honestly... This is harsh, but when I see those people who want to attack, injure, or even kill my colleagues... Guys who attack colleagues, who are just defending themselves! Will the police be accused again of being violent? What did the police do to deserve that? Were they violent? Not a fucking thing. “National Police" on their uniforms, and those cowards picking on them. It's outrageous. There's only one place for people like that: prison. They shouldn't be anywhere else. What I see is that they are grossly outnumbered. There are five motorcycle cops. And there's still traffic, so it's a mess. Part of the street is still open to traffic. At the very least, there's uncertainty. We see the crowd keeping its distance. Is the crowd afraid? Are people afraid of the police? The official draws his weapon very belatedly. He draws it there. Do the people, through the gas, after dark, see the drawn weapon? It was only out for a second. But they don't want to isolate them, they don't want to separate them, they don't want to kill them. They don't want to butcher them, though they could. It's within reach. It's when they are sure the police can get away, when they're all on their motorbikes, that they suddenly start running after them. When the officers are almost down, knees on the ground, righting their vehicles, only a few people go after them. We see violence, of course. But we also see restraint of violence. It's glaring how the violence is ritualized on both sides. No one wants to overturn the situation. As if both the police and the gilets jaunes were satisfied that, in the end, the state, embodied by its officials, retain the monopoly on violence. I am among those who think the police, in a certain way, are also victims. Differently, but victims also of this dramatic shift in the way law enforcement has been managed over the years. When a young officer loses it because he can't take it anymore, I understand that mistakes happen. The problem is that the nature of the police violence, its frequency, its repetition and the images clearly show - every French citizen has seen this - that this isn't an accumulation of random and unfortunate freak outs or isolated incidents. This is the mechanical, deliberate consequence of excessive, disproportionate, and unaccountable violence. Last warning! We will use force! As you walk and talk, you hear the "booms", you see the flames, the smoke everywhere, and you think: "This isn't the kind of demo I wanted. "This is not it. This is a guerilla war. It's crazy." Copy that. Well leave it. They're sick! I don't know what's in my eyes, but it's bad. They gassed us like crazy. They're gonna arrest us. Just put your hands up. They can arrest us, we're innocent. That's when the police came in. Right before, Max told everyone to put their hands up: "We didn't do anything, so we're not at risk. "They can take us away. They'll have nothing against us, no problem." Maxime and I are right there. With the backpack. You can only see him, on top of me, you only see my legs and sneakers. I won't let you go. On your feet! We didn't do anything, Sir! At the exit, there was like a tunnel of riot police. I screamed: "Don't touch my boyfriend!" I could clearly see that... everyone was getting bludgeoned. Don't touch my boyfriend! Don't touch him! Don't touch him! - Clear out! - Stop! Stop kicking me! So clear out! I did! I'm in the street! It's OK! - Wanna see my card? - Fuck your card! Don't talk to me that way. That's enough, dammit! To employ violence like that, the riot police have to have rules. Meaning necessity. Here we ask: is it necessary to bludgeon people on the ground who are not dangerous. I have no doubt that it's not necessary and the violence is not legitimate. I see a lot of anger. I see a lot of anger, and law enforcement is not about anger. If there's misconduct, it's punished... This isn't misconduct! Holding someone down and beating them over the head? We don't need context. The people are on the ground. Is that bad or is it normal? Bad or normal? What I'm saying... The guy's on the ground screaming "Stop!" You can see him! Several cops are beating him. Is that normal? Every deviant action must be investigated and sanctioned. That's clear. Benoit, is that excessive? When you see the images, you can indeed wonder what really happened. We can see! In these images, what happened is shocking. OK. Our fellow officers! They're being attacked. We have to send reinforcements. Those motherfuckers. One man is down, look. Those assholes. Fuck, they should shoot! A couple of slugs would do it. The three regimes of power are fusing. The feudal regime of protecting institutions: the Elysée Palace is a fortified castle that mustn't be touched. The lord's domain, surrounded by a moat of cops. The disciplinary regime is going full speed: you pile on the tear gas, the sublethal weapons. You attack, strike, repress. And the regime of control doing prevention, collecting information, determining possible intentions, studying social networks. All three regimes are active simultaneously. It's no longer some relatively subtle control, identifying dangerous elements and controlling the stadium. They're deploying everything at once. I don't like calling it totalitarian because it's too easy to say, but it is totalizing to activate the three regimes simultaneously. We mobilized everything against them. We mobilized the police in great quantity. We mobilized the judicial apparatus, also in incredible ways, with a huge increase in immediate trials. That hasn't been done in ages. Immediate trials for demonstrators to that extent is unprecedented. Trials, prison sentences... Enough is enough! Trials that are practically bogus, along with the massive use of preventive arrest before any participation in a demonstration such as we haven't seen in France since World War II. Something has exploded into the public, police, and judicial arenas, whence an enormous pressure, with thousands of people in custody. In custody why? Some people had weapons, OK. But in most cases, what for? People were put in police camps, in police custody for 24 or 48 hours to keep them from demonstrating. It was a massive misuse of procedures to curtail the fundamental rights of freedom of assembly and expression. With unintended consequences for the police force... - For everyone! - Absolutely. The police don't want to hold all these people. They can't cope. The police are being sacrificed by politicians. The police and the law were sacrificed - especially the law - when the state of emergency became part of common law. - Symbolically, it was terrible. - Terrible. There's a well-behaved class! We should show their teachers. They've never seen anything like it. Eyes forward! They say it themselves: we're not even sub-citizens, or second-class citizens. They say it all the time: we're nothing. Not heard, not seen, not respected. We're humiliated, we're harassed. On that day, they weren't seen as young students demonstrating because they feared the new reforms, and what they meant for their future. They were seen as rioters. There's a well-behaved class. I don't dispute when the police say the skirmishes were violent beforehand. But you cannot end up here. If you do... The job was done badly. It's unacceptable. My son was on his knees for three and a half hours, hands on his head. I dare anyone to spend five minutes in those conditions. Then we can talk. There's a well-behaved class. The policeman him self is filming. It shows they're acting with impunity. He thinks: "Hey, I'll film it! "Il make a sarcastic joke. "Il laugh with my pals. I'll share it, and no one will do anything." And that makes you think. We know the extent of it, but here we can see they really feel they have complete impunity. This is no longer about the necessity of the circumstances. It's no longer a balanced negotiation between dignity and necessity. This is cruelty. The image tips just with those words. "Ah, there's a well-behaved class." What's unjustified and unjustifiable is the spectacle of enjoyment, the sharing of enjoyment. It's unacceptable. What was even more violent was saying: This is a message. Memorize it well. It means we're taking control. Tome, it's practically saying: We're back to a disciplinary regime. And that's fine. We're going to use a repressive approach again, get ready. We're heading toward a period not of control but of discipline. Bourdieu says for the state to successfully employ physical violence, there must be symbolic violence. Here we see very clearly that the police is claiming a monopoly of control over an age group, ora section of our youth, which is the youth from the housing estates. They can only access public education on their knees. That's what the images tell us. That violence has been inflicted for 30 years. Here they become aware that they live in a territory, a territory for testing police violence. It brings to mind Adama Traoré, Lamine Dieng, and Ali Ziri. People who died as a result of police operations. This issue used to be confined to extremely radical circles or the working-class neighborhoods that were laboratories for police violence and emergency laws. - Laboratory, that's rubbish... - Absolutely! - We were guinea pigs for... - That's harsh! I say what I think. You don't make concessions, and neither do I. We were guinea pigs for emergency laws and for the policing doctrine that is wreaking havoc everywhere that wasn't affected before. White people in the periphery were unaffected before. They've noticed now, and police violence has become central. As a police institution, you cannot maintain the status quo. At some point, it'll blow. We know that violence. I was born in my neighborhood, and I'll die there. I love that neighborhood. It's in my DNA. I'll never leave Amiens Nord. But it's become commonplace. Violence against kids in the housing estates is normal. They deserve it. The estates should be pressure washed. We didn't ask for it. We requested public housing and they put us there. "There are three kinds of violence. “The first, mother of all others, is institutional violence. "It legalizes and perpetuates domination, "oppression, and exploitation. "It crushes and eliminates millions of people "in its silent and well-oiled cogs. "The second is revolutionary violence, "which is born of the will to abolish the first. "The third is repressive violence, "which stifles the second "by making itself the helper and accomplice of the first violence, the one that causes all the others." Rémi Fraisse, killed by a police grenade. Sivens, October 25, 2014 "There is no worse hypocrisy "than only calling the second one Violence', "while pretending to forget the first one, that gives it life, and the third one, that kills it." Hélder Câmara, Brazilian Archbishop. To Malik Oussekine, student, aged 22, beaten to death on December 6, 1986 ...By the police Zyed Benna and Bouna Traoré, electrocuted in a power station after being chased by police. Clichy-sous-Bois, October 27, 2005 Zineb Redouane, fatally struck by a tear gas grenade Marseille, December 1, 2018 But it's Music Day! There are two guys in the river! Steve Maia Canico, drowned in the Loire after being charged by police. Nantes, June 21,2019 Who killed Steve? Fucking shit! His hand was blown off In front of the Assembly! I just bent over and it exploded. My hand was close, maybe 15 or 20 centimeters. And it went boom. If we were just marching and demanding our rights, without all of that violence, there'd be way more people. People are afraid. As soon as the demo starts, during the first minute tear gas is fired. People are afraid for their lives! It's not about legitimate violence and who holds it. It's who has the legitimacy to say who's violent. That's where the fight is now. Who has the media power and the statutory legitimacy to say: "You are violent, and we're enforcing the law." Or vice versa, the insurgents or militants who say: "We're not violent, we're making legitimate demands. But you are violent." Who will win the fight for the legitimacy to say what is violent? I'm inside Fouquet's. Fouquet's laid waste. This is what's left. Police! Get out! Get out! Get moving! Hurry it up. The idea is to get power to react. The encounter is broken, but the encounter with power in a demo is very particular. Generally speaking, power passes through us, at every moment of our existence. It constitutes us. It's a Foucauldian notion of power: indecipherable, with no center, but it produces effects in everyday life, and it's hard to remove it from our daily lives. So what does a demonstration do? It simplifies the relationship to power, makes it concrete. It suddenly appears, leaps out. The police with truncheons is the show of power. It's a bit grotesque, reacting in a naked, brutal way. It runs after you, it manifests unambiguously, unequivocally. This isn't the refined power we're used to. There's a form of enjoyment in it. I made power react. It exists in my perception. And I can touch it, affect it. This is all very symbolic, because obviously it remains... It's not much. As for property damage, it's very similar. To pick a piece of display window off the ground is to hold a piece of power. And the targeted institutions are always institutions of capitalism: real estate agencies, banks, etc. The idea isn't to materially affect power. However, what you perceive is the collapse of its display. When you pick up that piece of glass, you're holding a piece of power. And you're wounding its pride. Hey, they're afraid! Macron, we're on our way! Get the fuck out! We're unarmed! We have no weapons, we've got nothing! We have no violence! No hatred! We just want dialogue! Demonstrating on the Champs-Elysées is symbolic. There's also the proximity to those who fuck us over every day. They're so close. Protected by RoboCops, but within reach. You go when big demos are happening in Paris, and you hope it'll be the day you get to them. It's the day we're all waiting for. "Guys! We're inside the Elysée Palace." Macron said: "Let them come get me." It won't be long now. He's doing everything he can. That's the truth. - Will they invite us in for drinks? - We'll throw our own party! Obey the law! Disperse! We will use force! We are the people! We pay you! Stop hitting me! In point of fact, the gilets jaunes never employed firearms. In an over-armed country, with its hunting rifles, not one weapon was used. That's not a revolution. A revolution seeks to eliminate the seats of power. In this case, a few people approached the seats of power in early December. It's a fine line between ecstatic vision and murderous frenzy. Symbolic violence is one thing. But when you're facing people who want to mutilate you... Unbelievable! Who was in fact mutilated? ...you have to defend yourself. People stigmatize the police, but as Pasolini said: I prefer the policeman, son of a worker, to the student thug, son of a lawyer. During the 19th-century revolutions, like in Flaubert's "Sentimental Education": the people were drunk on violence, they wanted to storm the palace, wallow in the queen's bed, drink from the cellars until they were inebriated. This is not that. In this configuration, violence is unleashed in a tiny area. That's a well-behaved bourgeoisie. Reinstate the wealth fax! I know there are problems, I'm sick of taxes, too. I'm sick and tired of rising prices. But the people who work here, they show up super early, they're super nice, they come from super far away, and this isn't right! You're taking people's jobs! Good night, Mrs Macron! - It's not right. - They're getting paid, anyway. But who pays them? Everyone! Who is the state, Sir? Forme, the legitimacy of violence is absolutely democratic in the sense that anyone can endorse it, individually or collectively. The legitimacy isn't solely the state's for exercising violence. I recently reread a text by Jean Genet, the preface to a book about the Red Amy Faction. He contrasts violence and brutality. He explains that what the state and the police do is brutality, and that violence is very close to the notion of life. He provides metaphorical examples 1 find beautiful, and that seem very provocative today. He cites the gem of wheat bursting open, splitting the frozen earth. The tiny chick with its beak, cracking the egg and breaking free. The example of human birth, of budding trees... All of those acts that are concretely violent, because they are tearing, breaking, smashing, are essential gestures of life and the life force. We live in a society with very intense systemic violence: economic violence, political violence... It's violence through a very indirect system, with 2 or 3 or 10 or 12 tracks, but that, at the end of the line, produces something ferocious in people's lives. And that violence is very hard to outsmart. Its source is very far from the person enduring it, so it's very hard to find who is responsible for it. You tend to take it internally, be subjected to it, to endogenize it, and to inflict it on yourself. We know what it produces: somatic illness, anxiety, depression, suicide... Or you take it out on your family. That violence has to come out. It expresses constrained life forces that need to be freed again. Rediscovering that proximity between life and violence is very important. Violence seen as legitimate... It is legitimate once you experience it. Back up 50 meters or I pull the pin! You're mad! Calm down! You're holding a grenade! Back off We're hacking off! If the state holds that monopoly, what distinguishes it from a mafia, or from a family where the pater familias exercises violence without limits over his wife and children? If the state loses legitimacy, it will be challenged by groups and individuals who will point a finger and say: "Who are you to exercise this violence?" In the Benalla affair, we have a citizen, Alexandre Benalla, assert his proximity to president Macron in order to use force. Let go of me! Who are you? Listen to me! I filmed the event on my phone, and posted it on Twitter. It was only 2 months later, when we learned he worked for the President, that anyone took an interest. I thought they were plainclothes police, though the way they acted seemed a little strange, which is why I say in the video: "Look at his face! He beat a guy on the ground." No media were interested, as if a police officer beating a demonstrator or a passerby was normal. Benalla didn't choose just any uniform to beat that man. He chose a police uniform. It's symptomatic of police impunity. That picture is wild! There are passengers! There are kids here! Don't fire your non-lethals! That guy there! No, to the left! Get back! Calm down, man! Bring the kids through. My god, there are small children! Seriously! There are children here. Unbelievable! This is unbelievable. It's incredible. Film someone else, bitch! - Did you call me a bitch? - Yes. Film someone else. No problem, it's on film. - What's on that picture? - It's a video. Fucking leftie! Anarchist, leftist! You're against democracy! Where's your armband? Give me your collar number please, Sir. And you give me your name! Give me your collar number. You're required to wear it and give it. You called me a bitch, Sir. You called me a bitch, Sir. Give me your collar number. Fuck off! Beat it! We get hit with rocks, and you only film the police. Bravo. 1 will not justify my assignment. We'll show your kids what you're like. Bravo democracy! You're anti-democratic! Against the Republic and democracy! I'll take your name and take you in! Take me in where, Sir? Where will you take me, Sir? To the station, you poor little thing. The panopticon is a prison with a central tower that can see anyone in the cells without being seen. Since you don't know when you're seen or not, You exercise a very strong self-censorship because you don't know when the guard is watching you. The asymmetry between seeing and being seen founds the panopticon. The smartphone overturns that, and you can film the police bludgeoning, you can film mistakes, aggressions, police assaults on individuals and immediately upload them live, countering the usual media or police versions. That's a reversal of the asymmetry. We're making symmetrical something that was only one-way before. It's invaluable. Get back! I'm a journalist! Let me do my job! Lower that! I'm a journalist! I have the right! The right to be here! I have the right to do my job, OK? You see these videos: “Look, he hit someone!" But before you see the officer's final gesture of self defense, do you see what happened before? Do you see the officer being insulted? Do you see them being hit? Do I keep you from doing your job? Do I go to a police control and say: "Stop this control!” The police tell me: "Stop filming!" The phone is 3 cm from their face, and the images end up on social media. 3 cm? This close? I've never seen that. Every day I see my colleagues on social medial Do you know what it's like to work while constantly being filmed? Alright. "Article 12, Declaration of the Rights of Man of 1789." ...The Rights of Man and of the Citizen. "The safeguard of the rights of man requires public military forces: "these forces are thus established for the good of all, and not for the personal advantage of those to whom they shall be entrusted." Just what we needed! Very timely. Our revolutionaries were very smart when they drafted the Declaration. The public police force, one subject to public scrutiny... Technology may today be making that possible. All of a sudden Apple or others brought out the integrated camera, the smartphone, and suddenly, in my opinion, a logic emerged - to which the various forces are adapting very slowly - that makes the public police force possible, meaning the constraint of public oversight. Share this, friends! It's out of hand at the Bastille. Watch out, they're charging! They're looking for a guy. Put that thing down! Motherfucker! Son of a bitch! Medic! He's bleeding! We have a wounded man! Lie down. On your back. They took out his eye! Hold my hand, I'm here! - My phone... - It's on you. Call my family. We'll put it in your pocket. How the demonstration is represented is part of the demonstration. We're cutting the live feed. We needn't quote Debord, but we've long understood the importance of images and spectacle of what we show along with what we do. We're at a stage that's important for the horizontality of distribution. The power structure no longer decides what can and cannot be broadcast. The whole set of recordings, if we take them one by one, is very interesting. The ensemble shows which practices prevail at a given time. For the United Nations, it's a critical phenomenon. Fifteen years ago, many of the scenes we're seeing now were taking place daily, but were hidden because we didn't have the phones to film them. We didn't have tools to share the evidence immediately. That's a radical change that has transformed my methods. I now receive complaints on WhatsApp, people submit things on Signal, on Telegram. People send pictures and brief statements I can start working on, looking for more investigative elements. That's really central. Nothing is hidden, and what's happening is revealed to the world through videos that get amplified. Where's the police chief? He shot me with a grenade. Where's the chief now? Back off No, calm down! I didn't do anything to you! OK, forget it. - So, is it OK now? - Stop! It's OK! Why are you flipping us off? - I took a grenade! - I don't give a fuck! -Is it OK now? -No. Despite these videos from opponents that are necessary and invaluable, it feels like they can't quite stop the steamroller of the government line. They do become part of a strategic combat: When do I release the image? Quick enough to serve as a rebuttal? Given the unprecedented violence of the rioters, there were no excesses from the police. No deaths, no serious injuries, which all experts agree is proof of a great deal of control. Please show us where the police can shoot you with a flash-ball. They can shoot at the ams... The police are admired by many French people. I'm not sure, but they can shoot at this zone here, and at the legs. How are you experiencing the terrible accusations against law enforcement of hyper-violence? They must avoid the head. The government is not drifting toward authoritarianism, but is often much too weak. More than ever we need a strong and protected police force. If the grenade had hit his hand directly, OK, we could ask questions. But the images speak for themselves. He bends down and picks it up. He asked for it. More than ever, the media should protect the police. When I hear the deployment of terms like "unprecedented" or "extreme" violence"... No, that violence is not extreme. It's not "unprecedented". If violence is the only term we have to describe this, what vocabulary remains to describe the attack on the Bataclan by guys with Kalashnikovs who murdered 80 people? What words are let? France is being lectured by the UN. Is that right? Is it the role of the UN? Or is it unreal? Ms. Bachelet, who was a distinguished president of Chile, has totally lost it. It would be interesting to know who whispered in that commission's ear the idea that France doesn't respect human rights. I intervened because a matter was referred by a group of individuals who felt they were victims as human rights defenders, and who sent me a file. I asked the French government some questions. And they became indignant. The Minister of the Interior, the Prime Minister's office: "How can you cite France alongside Haiti or Venezuela? It's grotesque." I got both a good and a bad surprise. The good one was that I got a reply, which not all states provide. Butin it the government evaded the main questions. As a democracy, France has no police violence, so how could I assert that I'd received complaints? The narcissistic wounds some people suffered meant that the more pressure there was, the stronger the resistance was to calling in the UN. I kept hearing: "The investigation is ongoing, we can't comment. Let's let the complaints board do its job. We'll see later" But we never saw anything later. President Macron had to use the police and the army. No one likes that, but it had to be done. President Pifiera must do the same. His main responsibility is the security of the country. He will have to doit, within limits of course. My fear is, seeing how police violence is developing in France, how crowd control is done in France, that other countries - in Africa, but not only - will follow suit, saying: If the country that claims to be the homeland of human rights can act in that way, why should we be criticized for using the same methods? There are underpinnings to these emerging phenomena. It's interesting to note that, beginning in 2014, France was downgraded on the indexes that measure democracy. We were... moderately downgraded. We exited the group "full democracies" to join the category of "flawed democracies.” So France declined at the international level. We didn't fall below the level of Russia or Qatar, that's certain. But we did decline. The French president invited me, so it's uncomfortable to say, but during the gilets jaunes demonstrations, dozens of people were injured. Police officers were injured. We do not wan such events to occur in the Russian capital, but we will always respect the law. The president is right to make distinctions between the situations of our countries. There are currently demonstrations everywhere in our countries. We can see that. Nonetheless, France has always respected not only the rights in its constitution, but those of the Council of Europe. Freedom of assembly has been protected. When some disrupt the public order, it must be protected. It's the correlate of freedom of assembly. In France - and this is why the comparison does not hold - the demonstrators participated in elections. We are a country where people can express themselves freely, demonstrate freely, vote freely. We cannot accept that they riot and disturb the public order. That infringes on the freedoms of others. It's the difference between freedom, which presupposes public order, as protected by the constitution and the European Court, and the non-respect of freedoms when people's freedoms are reduced. This is central about what's at stake, meaning the place of the police in democracy and the very definition of what a democracy is. Democracy is a horizon. The question is whether we position it as the horizon, and if it's where we're headed. But it's been falsified, with a screen of false democracy in front of it. Democracy has been reduced to instrumental formulas. We're told that if we have free elections, the separation of powers, and a multiparty system, we're in a democracy. No. Those are some of the means of democracy. They're necessary. I don't disregard them. But they're not enough. The paradox is that, in democracy, we more willingly employ repression than prevention. We let people assemble. Sometimes we let them get out of hand, and commit abuses. And we repress. Or else the situation gets out of control. A preventive regime is one in which everything is done to avoid the risk of the slightest abuse. It's the Russian regime. To avoid demonstrations, everyone is arrested before they get off the subway, and the streets are left open to traffic. No one sees a thing, people are arrested at home, and they are jailed preventively. Preventively, their means of communication are cut off, and there is no public disorder. And you can see that Vladimir Putin plays on that opposition, saying: "I use less force than you do." Without mentioning that if the uses less force, it's because he has kept demonstrators off the street. And you get Emmanuel Macron trying to defend himself for using force because he can't keep the demonstration from happening. They're blocking us from our declared route. Declared and legal. The riot police are here. We don't know why. They think we're going to... What? As if we were planning to enter the National Assembly! In legal terms, a regime is authoritarian when it voluntarily lowers the level of democratic possibilities. We're not really there yet. Legally we cannot say this is an authoritarian regime. But that the power in place has authoritarian tendencies, you don't have to be a psychologist to see it. The debate is in the street That's very interesting for the future. Will democracies follow the lead of preventive regimes? Meaning regimes in which public order is a sacred good and in which disorder, anything that threatens order in the least - on the pretext that order is essential for freedom - and in which they will preventively keep demonstrations from taking place. These are two incarnations of the tension between order and liberty. Democracy isn't consensus but dissensus! If there is no dissensus, there is no democracy. If we all agree, something's wrong. Our freedoms have somehow been infringed. We can't all agree. It's a very old idea in political philosophy. Machiavelli wrote of the "tumult" in Florence. What he called tumult was the life of the democracy. It was the disagreement between the elites and the people. We have to accept disagreement and give it life in democracy, not reduce it or stifle it. The emergence of Russia as an ideological counterpoint, and we could add China, returns to Western democracies - and I remain convinced they are democracies - returns to Western democracies the duty to justify themselves, the duty to do better, to be exemplary. Fucking shit! His hand is ripped off In front of the Assembly! Don't look, sweetheart! Move aside! Apply a tourniquet! We've got it! Keep out of the way!
