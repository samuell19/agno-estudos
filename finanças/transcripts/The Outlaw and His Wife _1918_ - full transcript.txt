The Swedish Film Institute made a new dupe negative from an incomplete 35 mm nitrate copy, preserved by Cinématèque Royale de Belgique. Scenes were added from two b/w copies in the institute's archives. This negative is the source for the digital restoration made in 2015. The colors have been recreated from an analog copy as reference. A story in pictures (seven acts) about the destiny of two people. The story takes place in Iceland in the middle of the 18th century when the strict laws caused many outlaws to hide in the hills. The main characters' lives are based on historical facts. Halla is pronounced Hadla and Kári is pronounced Kauri. Halla is molded after a Danish woman's spirit. ACT ONE Björn Bergstéinsson, the county sheriff. "The sheep have been unsettled today." "The boy lost two of them up in the hills." Arnes, an itinerant worker. "Go and find those sheep right now!" "Heaven help you if you don't!" A stranger. "Have you ever seen such beautiful lichens before?" "I've got a whole bag full of them. Boiled in milk, they taste great." "Smart move!" "You call this lichen, too?" "You think it would taste great if you boiled it in milk?" "Put the knife away. You don't have to worry about me." "My name is Kári." "I come from the south, looking for work." "Do you know of anyone who can use two strong arms?" "Halla's farm is there, down below." "She's a woman of generous spirit. She might have work for you." Halla, a wealthy widow. The county sheriff Björn is her brother-in-law and neighbor. "Take this chest upstairs." "There is a man of mighty strength." "His name is Kári, from the south. He's looking for work." "I thought maybe you might find him useful on your farm." "You can stay for a month and try it." "The county sheriff is riding in!" "I saw that tramp Arnes out there." "My deceased brother wouldn't like to see the likes of him in his home." "And who is that fellow?" "He's a new worker I just hired." "I want to speak with you in private." "I'm not good with words..." "I'm 48 years old, but you're no youth either." "If we were to join forces, we'd have the largest estate in the county." "Would you consider marrying me?" "You find it so ridiculous?" "Now you're showing your true colors!" "When your brother told you he wanted to marry me, you said it was a disgrace for the family that he'd marry a servant!" "Your advice to him was to satisfy his lust, but without getting married!" "I have a hidden place where I hide the words my friends have shared with me." "You sure are your mother's daughter!" END OF ACT ONE ACT TWO Kári was like a man in a fairy tale. He fell down a deep well, thinking he'd never see the sun again. But suddenly he was in a green field and there was a castle... And the king's daughter walked towards him... "I thought you could have this quilt for your bed." "If I was a widow and owned a farm, maybe you would treat me differently!" "That big a farm doesn't exist in this country." In the county church on a Sunday in the late summer. "Who is that man?" No one can escape their destiny even if they run faster than the wind. "That man is not Kári!" "That is Ejvind from the hills down south." "A few years ago, he was the one who..." "Are you sure your eyes don't deceive you?" That same Sunday, there was a harvest feast at Halla's. "When you laugh, your hair rides up your brow." "If you have something you need to hide, keep your eyes and ears open. You have an enemy." "I was not aware that I have vexed anyone here." "Your very existence is enough to make enemies." "As of today, Kári is the foreman here on the farm!" "Obey him as you would obey me!" "I wish to speak with you in private." "Today I got some news, and as your brother-in-law, I see it as my duty to inform you." "A man from the south is staying with me, and he recognized your 'foreman' as a thief named Ejvind. I wanted to let you know so you can be spared any embarrassment and get rid of him." "I think I know why you are spouting accusations against Kári." "But you'll never make me believe that he's a thief!" "Come outside and tell him yourself if you dare!" "This man says your name is Ejvind and that you are a thief!" "What is your response to that?" "That's a lie!" "You come here to listen to untruthful accusations!" "I'll give you something more entertaining than that!" "You'll see how a man like Kári treats a mean backstabber!" "The county sheriff will have to fight the one he calls a thief!" "You're crazy! An honest man will not fight a thief!" "The sheriff says he won't fight a thief!" "He's just trying to get out of it! He's a coward!" "Björn Bergstéinsson has never been called a coward before!" END OF ACT TWO ACT THREE "Kári will be back in jail before sunrise!" "Give me your hand, Kári, and tell me you're innocent." "You don't believe me either." "Tell me you are innocent!" "In this matter, I am innocent." "I'm so happy to know you are innocent!" "I'm so glad, I could kiss you!" "Kári! Will you marry me?" "Halla! I can't!" "Are you married?" "No." "I didn't think that your eyes could lie to me." "You should go." "My eyes haven't lied..." "I knew a man by the name of Ejvind..." "He was poor and had many children." "They often went without food." "Ejvind went to the priest to borrow some food." "He offered labor in exchange, but the priest wouldn't help." "There was a snowstorm and it was late at night." "Ejvind went past the priest's sheep pen." "Temptation got the better of him." "The snowstorm would cover any tracks..." "And the priest was wealthy enough. I hated him!" "Late at night, Ejvind arrived home with a large sheep." "The next day..." "...a message arrived from the priest." "They found his mittens in the sheep pen." "They said they could prove he had stolen many times before." "He was sentenced to ten years in jail." "My name isn't Kári!" "It's Ejvind! I'm a convicted thief!" "I escaped..." "...and lived like an outlaw in the hills by the warm springs." "I have lost my faith in mankind..." "Do with me as you please. Kick me out of your house." "Turn me in to the authorities." "But you have to forgive me." "It was poverty and the snow that made me a thief." "I don't want to cry. Crying is ridiculous!" "Stand up! I am not a God from whom you should ask forgiveness." "There were many times I wanted to tell you the truth, but it became harder with each passing day." "I never understood why until now..." "...but now I understand and now I can tell you." "Kári has loved you..." "You are the only woman he's ever loved." "But Kári is no more and has never been more than a poor man's dream." "He's loved you for a long time, but has never seen your beauty until now." "Like a blue hill, rising from the mist." "Close your eyes, Kári, and sleep a moment longer." "Kiss me!" "I want to sleep with my eyes open..." END OF ACT THREE ACT FOUR "So, you see, there is no doubt in my mind that my sister-in-law's foreman is the escaped convict Ejvind of the Hills. You need to arrest him immediately!" "Where is Kári?" "You shouldn't have to suffer any longer on account of me!" "I will turn myself in!" "We will find him! He will not be free for long!" "Thank God, they are gone!" "I have to leave very shortly." "I've asked Arnes to help me." "When the sky is red in the morning, I will be far up in the hills." "God bless you, Halla." "Should I ask you to marry me a second time?" "I thought we were married!" "In God's eyes, we already are!" "In that case, isn't it customary for a wife to go with her husband?" "Will you be my wife and follow me through all suffering?" "Yes, I will!" "You can't run away with me, Halla!" "You don't know what kind of life that is." "And you'll forever be called a thief-- like me!" "You're such a child!" "If I can't marry you, I have to marry the county sheriff!" "You're so beautiful!" "All our time together is reflected in your face." "Your soul lives in your eyes." "When you look at me, I feel an invisible hand caress my face." "Tonight, we will ride together towards the hills!" "House, home and honor-- she gave it all up for him." "They reached the plains in the early morning." "Onwards and upwards!" END OF ACT FOUR ACT FIVE They had lived like outlaws for five years, hunted like animals. But they were the rulers of the hills! Everything they could see belonged to them. When the sun hits the edge of the glacier, you see the most beautiful colors even though it's colorless and full of mud and ice. Love was the sun in their lives... "...and now I'm an outlaw, too!" "I've lived in the hills alone for two and a half years." "When she arrived in this world, the sun was shining and the sky was warm and blue." They never felt alone. They were kindred spirits. There was a wasteland in their souls. "I will tie you now, Tota, so you won't fall in the river while I do laundry." "The sun is high in the sky already." "I better take this to Halla before we go on." "What do you say we go around the falls and try our luck getting to the lake on the other side?" "I think you were more scared than I was!" "Your whole body is trembling!" "There are human tracks here!" "Don't tell Halla about it. She'll just worry." END OF ACT FIVE ACT SIX God is sometimes far away, but the judgment of man is always near. "It's not impossible! It could be Ejvind of the Hills and his cohorts!" Love can make one person good and the other one bad... "I'm going to the river to wash up." "I need to get this sweat off my body!" "You should have a talk with Arnes." "He's more depressed with each day. I think he wants to leave." "Tell me, why should some men be happier than others?" "Kári has been happy for seven years." "One time when you were ill, I gave you some green shoots." "They had just sprung out of the snow. And you kissed me." "Is your soul at peace now?" "May I kiss you on the mouth? Just this once!" "Your lips won't hurt from it!" "I gave my husband everything-- including my conscience!" "I don't know what came over me. A devil dwells inside me..." "I love you..." "I understand now that I have to leave." "I can't stay with you two, and I can't live alone." "I will return to the people, and they can do what they want with me." "Farewell, Halla." "I will think of how lovely you are when I'm in jail." "Someone's coming!" "There's eight of them! You have to run-- don't waste any time!" "I won't leave Tota!" "It's too late! There's three of us against the eight of them!" "You have to give the child to them!" "Get them!" "It's Björn! I won't give my child to him!" "You devil!" Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. END OF ACT SIX ACT SEVEN After a long life together, desperate times struck. It was a winter night so bad, the grass trembled in despair. Starvation tore at the bonds the years had built up. "Close the door!" "This storm has lasted for seven days." "Do you think it can last much longer?" Hunger came to them in their dreams with sizzling meat that demanded their love as payment. "We promised each other not to speak of food!" "I want food! Food!" "Shame on you!" "Don't you think I'm suffering as much as you? But I'm silent!" "You made me stay here!" "If we die of starvation, it's all your fault!" "Who did the stealing? Was it me?" "You're ugly." "I never saw it before. Your face looks like a dead horse's head." "Is your hair coming out?" "I thought you were the only person that understood that I couldn't help what I did." "Are you leaving?" "I beg you, please. Stay. For my sake." "We've lived together for 16 years. We ought to die together." "You were happy once when I ran away with you into the hills." "You carried me across the rivers until I was strong enough to wade through myself." "All the nights we slept under the stars!" "Every morning we felt on our face was like a blessing." "You kissed me and said you loved me." "I would rather you kill me before you go!" "Stab me with your knife here." "I won't scream." "It will be like a bite from a breastfeeding baby." "And one of his disciples asked: 'Teach us, Lord, how to pray just as John taught his disciples.'" "He said to them, 'When you pray, say: Father, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come.' '...for thine is the kingdom and the glory forever and ever.'" "Amen." "I once had a dream about two people." "Their only law was their love." "After a long life, they came into hardship." "They looked into each other's eyes and went out into the snowstorm to die together..." "It's one's duty to live as long as possible!" "You don't love me anymore. You've never loved me." "Will you get some more wood? I'm cold." "God Almighty!" Death brought them absolution... Their one law was the love they shared. THE END
