Kate. Shit. Sorry, Kate. These fellas said that you've been expecting them. Of course. Thanks, Hank. Thanks. Hey. You forgot, didn't you? No, no. I just... Yeah. He just wanted to... Actually, this is him. Okay. I'm Dr. Sander Halvorson. Kate Lloyd. Yes. Do you know who I am? I do. Adam told me a little bit about you as well. He says you specialize in vertebrate paleontology. Primarily, yes. And obviously you've extracted specimens from pack ice. I've worked on several cold-weather digs. Good. Um... An old friend of mine, a colleague from Oslo, runs a geological research station in Antarctica. Forty-eight hours ago, his team found something quite remarkable. Really? What'd they find? We're flying down there tomorrow evening to examine the site and I need a paleontologist. Doctor, I'm sure you can understand that I need to know a little bit about what it is I'm being asked to dig up. There's a structure. A structure? Yes. In Antarctica? And a specimen. That's all I can tell you. And I guess I don't have any time to think about this? No, I'm sorry. I need your answer right now. Well... I'm in. Great. Adam will get you the details of our departure. I'll see you in the car. Yes, of course. Thank you. Adam. What the hell is it? You now officially know as much as I do. But I'll tell you one thing. I have worked for that guy for three years and I have never seen him this excited. Hey. She US? Mmm-hmm. Look at this guy. How is that even humanly possible? I was hoping maybe you could help me with something. I can't seem to get a hold of a newspaper that's not, you know, three weeks old, and I'm a man in desperate need of certain information. Carter, don't do this to yourself, man. And what information would that be? I wanna know how the Cavaliers are doing. Hmm. I don't follow football. It's a basketball team. They play basketball. Barely. They're the Cavaliers, man. Sorry I couldn't help you. That's all right. Hey, listen, so you guys know, whatever you all are doing, you might wanna wrap it up in a couple of days. Yeah? Why's that? There's a storm moving in. A nasty one. Good morning, Griggs. Yeah, he's right. And the last place that you wanna be is cooped up with a dozen Norwegian guys. Trust me. Base in sight at my one o'clock. This is H3 Sea King inbound for Thule. Do you copy? Hello, H3 Sea King. Please approach from the west. That path is clear. Throttle coming back. Good to go, Griggs. Dr. Halvorson? Yes. Welcome to Thule. Thank you. Edvard asked you to go to the site right now. Lars is gonna drive you. Hi. Hi, welcome. Please go in the Spryte. Thanks. Edvard! Yeah, this is Kate Lloyd. Columbia paleontology. Welcome. Adam Finch, my research assistant. Welcome. Hi. This is Edvard, my good friend. This is some of my team. This is Karl and Juliette. Both geologists. Hi. Welcome. Okay. Let me show you why you flew 10,000 miles. Holy shit. We estimate it's been here approximately 100,000 years. We picked up a signal transmitting. Some kind of distress call, perhaps. Incredible. We think the signal got triggered when the survivor exited the craft. Survivor? My God. How long will it take to get out? Do you know, Kate? Assuming you have the right equipment, I'd say, maybe a half a day. Good. Uh, the ice, I should ask you, how fragile is it? It's not in the fracture zone, so there's very little risk of fissuring. And the ice is quite dense, so we think we can get it out in one piece. Good. A rough estimate is about six by 12 feet, three and a half feet high. Probably someplace around three and a half... That's good. Make sure that everyone stays off the radio. We don't want any information out. And the crane, do we have something that's appropriate for this? Yeah, it's already there. It's all set up. I'm Peder, by the way. Peder. Nice to meet you. So you've got it all taken care of. I don't think you really need me. What about him? Is he completely disinterested or... Oh, that's Lars. He doesn't understand English, but he'll work like a bear. And as you can see from the scans, the ship carved a 200-meter tunnel into the ice. Wow. So let me get this right. You crash into a glacier, and then without enough information, you leave the cozy confines of your ship? Maybe it was hurt and wanted to find someplace warm. I guess it didn't find it. The first night is hard. I'm sorry. I don't mean to keep you up. No, no, it's fine. We'll never look at them the same again. ...93 pounds... ...complete pounds, about 1, 190. Yeah. What do you need for a transport weight? To cut it down to a portable weight, we'll have to take it from here to here. Start with four inches or so. I never believed in this shit. I always did. We all set? Nearly there. Good. But before we do, I'm going to take a tissue sample. Do you really think that's a good idea? Yes, I do. The conditions are so unpredictable and we don't have the proper equipment. Sterilization is an issue. Edvard, what do you have in the way of a small diameter drill? Up to 30 millimeters. Very good. I think somewhere around here. Kate. Just a second. In the future, don't contradict me in front of those people again. I just thought I'd... You're not here to think. You're here to get this thing safely out of the ice. I hope we understand each other. Here you are. So, have you ever tasted this before? No, I haven't. It tastes very bad. Gentlemen, ladies. After a short but thorough investigation of our visitor, I can say, unequivocally, that I have never seen anything on any cellular level like what we have in that other room. And the impact of this find will be felt for thousands of years. From this point on, the world as we know it has forever been altered. You, my friends, will all be immortalized as the people who made this discovery. Thank you. You think they're gonna pay a bonus for bringing home an alien instead of core samples? You got anything better than this cough syrup? Hey, Griggsey. Yeah? You wanna go out and get the captain's stash? Sure. No problem. I'm on it. Where'd I put those bottles? Boo! Jesus! Screw you, man. Son of a bitch. It broke out! Cuckoo! It ain't a damn joke, man! The frigging thing's alive! I was in the room, man, looking at the ice, the frigging thing jumped out! We will search in groups of two and three. The entire camp. If you find it, call out. Don't attempt anything on your own. And be careful. We don't know what condition it's in. Griggs. You leave that open? I don't remember. Shit. Hey, just be careful, man. That thing jumped through the fucking roof. Jesus Christ. Shh! Help! Over here! Help! Somebody! Over here! Where? It attacked Henrik! Come on! In there! Oh, God, somebody do something! Shoot it! Shoot the fucker! Hey! No, no, no, no! We gotta burn that fucker, man! Burn it! Throw it! Throw it! His blood pressure is low. Henrik had two small children. Yes, it's horrible. It was a horrible tragedy. We are all shocked at what happened to Henrik. But with due respect, we need to examine the remains before it all disintegrates. Hey, that was a man. Not remains. No, I'm talking about the creature. And I'm sure we're all aware of the importance of this discovery. This may be the first and only time mankind has been visited by an alien life form. And as scientists, we're obliged to study it. Didn't work out so well the last time, did it? I think you should destroy it. Completely. I think you've contributed enough to this endeavor. Really? Listen, your guy Olav back there, he's in bad shape. Now, we're gonna fly him back to McMurdo at sun up and take him to the military hospital. And what are you going to tell them? I'm gonna tell them the truth, as crazy as it sounds. Kate. Can you help here? Come on. Pull that side open. His face is encased in some type of amniotic sac. And the tissue looks almost new. What was it doing to him? It appears it was absorbing him. Some type of digestion. It's fascinating. It is fascinating. Hey. What's the matter? Are you okay? I'm fine. You sure? Yeah, I'm okay. You need something? No, no. I'm okay. What is this? It looks like a titanium plate. It's used to reinforce broken bones, compound fractures. Yeah, that's right. Henrik broke his arm last year. He had to go to Argentina to get it set. So if this was in his arm, what's it doing out of him now? That's a good question. What are you doing? I took a sample of Henrik's tissue. I want to find out what this thing was doing to him. I think you should take a look at this. These cells aren't dead. That's not possible. It looks like the alien cells are somehow attacking Henrik's cells and then they... What is that? It's like they're transforming into... They're imitating his cells. Okay, I don't know if that's what I'm seeing, but... They're imitating him. Place is giving me the creeps, man. No kidding. We're getting out of here not a moment too soon. Hey, yo, did you get that other thing? Yeah, all I could carry. It's going to be okay, Olav. A doctor will see you at McMurdo. Okay. Kate. Hey. We're leaving. If the weather holds up, we'll be back with help as soon as we can. Okay. All right. Keep him warm. I will. Come on, let's go. Sit down there. There you go. Let's get the hell out of here. Carter! Carter, wait! Come on! She's flagging us down. What's wrong? They shouldn't leave. Carter. Let's just get out of here, man. All right, fuck it. We're landing. Shit. Let's take her down. Is there something wrong? Uh... No, no, everything's fine. They probably just forgot something. We'll be in the air in no time. Okay? Don't worry. Hang in there. Something's wrong. Hailing McMurdo or any ears on emergency channel, do you copy? Over. I repeat, this is Thule Station. They crashed here, right behind this ridgeline. It's impossible to reach them. This doesn't make any sense. They had plenty of visibility, right? We're not going after them? Shouldn't we try? We need our chopper to even get close to them, and that's refueling in Halley. This can't be a coincidence. Radio's dead. It's fucking dead. The incoming storm. There's too much interference. Colin, Lars, get your gear. We'll take a snowcat to the next base. Lars. I don't think that's a good idea. And why is that? Because no one can leave this camp until we know more about what's going on here. I make decisions about this camp. I know, Edvard, but... Why did you flag down that helicopter? Because I thought it was in danger. Why? I took a sample of Henrik's blood. And I saw that the alien cells were still alive. They were alive and they were copying Henrik's cells. Replicating them. Adam saw it, too. Is that true? I don't know. I don't know what we saw. We saw something. I don't understand. What are you saying? That this thing can and probably has replicated a person. Yeah. Okay, okay. Kate, Kate. Okay. Kate. This is not the time to be yelling, "Fire." Let's stop, gather our thoughts, and discuss this in private. We don't need any private meetings, Doctor. We all want the fucking information. There's more. What are those? I think they're fillings from someone's teeth. I found them by a puddle of blood in the shower. A puddle of blood? It can clone cells, but not inorganic material. It couldn't copy these, so it spit them out. We've wasted too much time already. Lars... Listen. When I went back to check it, someone had cleaned up the blood. Someone had wiped it away. All right? So whatever it is, it is still here. I've heard enough. Lars, Colin, get your gear. Ten minutes. Please, Edvard. You can't leave. You can't leave. You don't know what we're dealing with. Well done. Kate. I don't know if I should be speaking about this. I don't wanna get anyone in trouble, but... Speaking about what? You were saying about someone cleaning up the blood from the shower, that someone here may not be themselves? Juliette, please. What did you see? After the crash, I think I saw Colin coming from the showers. He was holding something. It could have been a towel or a rag, something to clean up. Kate, I can't say for sure, but it's just the... He's leaving with Edvard. We can't let him go. We can't let any of them go. I know where they keep the keys for the vehicles. Okay. Where are they? In that drawer. This one? Yes. How many am I looking for? Five. There's three and four. You said there were five? Run! Kate, what happened? Karl! It got Karl! It got Karl! Kate... Burn it! What the fuck's happening to us? It attacks its prey, copies it perfectly, and then hides inside it, waiting. Is it still among us? It could be any of us. We've gotta get out of here. Yeah. Right now. Then you could be getting in a vehicle with it. You'd be alone. Vulnerable. That's exactly what it wants. Not to mention you'd be giving it a way out of here. A way to spread. It's like a virus. So what do we do with any virus? Quarantine. We isolate it and then we kill it. Yeah. We have to rely on science. Exposing our uncontaminated blood to the cells of the creature might create a reaction of some kind. So we take blood samples from everybody. Yeah, and we test each one of them. Yes. Adam and I can do that. Okay. Lars and I will disable the vehicles. We have to trust in this plan. It's our only chance of making it through this. Is that it? No more vehicles? Okay. What? Is everything all right? Yes. Yes, everything's fine. Good. Kate, we should go. The storm is getting worse. Who is that? Hurry, they're coming! The Americans. It's impossible for a human to survive that crash. We should burn them. Right here, right now. It could be murder. It could be survival, Kate. Yes, but we don't have to kill them. All right? We can just lock them up until Sander's test is ready. Please. So this is a good idea? Locking us up? You need our help. Okay. Kate. A bunch of scientists, they can't handle what we saw in that chopper. For all we know, you could be one of those things. It is pretty hard to believe you both walked away from that crash. Yeah, I get that. I do, but... We're preparing a test, and then we figure out who's who. It's all I can offer you right now. Someone sabotaged it. There's nothing left. Nothing. Now there's no test. How could this happen? It was no accident. You. You were in there with it. You were the last one. Why are you accusing me? Why not? He's got something to hide. What are you, an asshole? I was the one working on the test. I left for two minutes! You just don't want us to know the truth, do ya? Bullshit! Don't tell me to fucking calm down! Calm down! Calm down! This is a goddamn fucking nightmare! There might be another way. I think there might be another way to tell. Peder, give me your flashlight. Now tell Lars to open his mouth. Huh? Tell him to open his mouth. Good. Lars has fillings. So he's human. It can't imitate inorganic material. See? Good. Open. Okay. Okay. Good. Right now it's at least something. A way to eliminate some of us. So I'm gonna get killed because I floss? Nobody's getting killed. Kate. Kate, come on. Kate. Just do it. Kate. Open. Just go stand over there. You know as well as I do, there are too many variables. Open your mouth. Open your mouth! They're porcelain. Go stand by Adam. Anyone else with porcelain fillings? Or clean teeth? This is bloody absurd. This is wrong. Jonas, you and Lars go out, get Carter and Jameson and bring them in here. We'll check them, too. But why don't we just leave them where they are? They can't do anything. We need to know. Yeah. Lars. Lars! Lars! Lars! Lars! Peder. Whatever they're saying, right now it doesn't matter. You can't trust them. Watch them. Kate! Come on! Where are they? Where are the rest? They attacked him! Who? They got Lars! Peder! What happened? Peder, keep them back. Stay on them, Peder! We don't know if we can trust them! Stay on them! Stay on them, Peder! They're inside. Hey! Calm down! What have you done with Lars? I said calm down! Where the fuck is Lars? Drop it. Somebody tell him! Put it down! Peder. Peder. Okay. I just want to check my friend, okay? It's okay. He was gonna fire. It's gonna blow! Watch out! Edvard? Edvard? Pick him up. Okay. Get down. Get down. You. Yeah, you, help him! All right, show yourselves. Right fucking now! Everybody in the rec room. Pick him up. Come on. Sit down. Not all of us are human. Just put him over there on the couch. Get it off! What the fuck is this shit, man? Carter! Carter, burn it, man! There's something wrong with it! Fuck! God damn it, Carter, burn it! Shit! Carter, table! Carter! Something's wrong with the pressure. It's got air in the pipe! Watch out! We gotta get the air out! No! No! Burn it! I'm with you, buddy. Carter? Hey. Are you okay? Yeah. Are you? Not yet I'm not. We find it and we kill it. I think that was Sander. Yeah. Gross. Oh, no! Get it! You see it? Where'd it go? There! Get back! Don't. Don't touch it. Did you hear that? Yeah. Kate. Sander. Wait. So what? It'll freeze out there. And if it doesn't? If it makes it out of here, millions of people could die. It's got nowhere to go. Yes, it does. Come on. All right. What? What happened to Lars? We didn't kill him. Come on. Run! Run! Kate! Kate! Kate? Kate! Kate! So what do we do now? There's a Russian station about 50 miles from here. We should have enough gas. We're gonna make it back, okay? Okay. Let's go. I'll put this in the back. You know how I knew you were human when you showed up back at base? No. Your earring. It was your other ear. Kate... Kate, what are you doing? Let's talk about this. Talk to me. Kate. Kate! No! Hello? Edvard? Hello! Hello! Lars!
