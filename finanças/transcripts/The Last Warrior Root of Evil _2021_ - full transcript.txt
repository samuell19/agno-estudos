I told you. We didn't have to bring this beautiful girl with us. You see a girl in the mirror every day. Why did we have to leave so early, anyway? 8/Users/Claudine/Desktop 00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08,950 You could assume the villains fled after breakfast. I didn't even have time to drink coffee. Then return to your bedchamber. Otherwise, you'll flood the forest with tears. Really... I want to, but you can't do this without me. You know? Trouble! Trouble! Help, protectors! What is it, father? Speak. Where is the strength of knights needed? Monster... strange monster has appeared. Not a man, not a beast. We don't know what it is. People are missing from the village. The cattle are spooked. Ooo... Why you don't just tell us what we're dealing with? At least I'd know if I should bring a pistol. Err... Aren't you... - too few? - Few? - Are seven knights not enough for you? - Huh? Six and a half. Only six and a half percent of your brain works, joker. - Old man. - Yes. Tell me where the monster is. Yes. I am the son of Ilya Muromets... We'll deal with it! Over there. Hey! Where are you guys? Beard, is that you? Why do you come here? Human! Have you come for my soul? Who? I? No. I... I'm just passing by... Ok. I'm leaving. Where are you going? Where were you? I actually... found the monster. I'll go around from the back. And you from this side. Ooooh. Yes, you are not alone, I see. I haven't eaten knights in a long time! Now you have a chance. I will destroy all of you! What is this flying head? Huh? Kolobok. Kolobok. Kolobok? Shields. Ready? Remove it. Did the dough escape? Give it another go. On the buns! Now you know not to mess with knights. Back to the city. Get the pies... How did you get here, poor girl? Whose are you? Where are your parents? Don't cry, don't cry. Don't cry, I'll get you out. What an infection. 00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:12,121 The Last Knight: The Root of Evil Let's get you out of here. - Good morning! - Hi there. Have you been here long? I just arrived. How was it? Are you tired? Peasants... They complain about some animal. Incredibly, it turned out to be Kolobok. He's kind of... mad. He thrashed all the knights. If it wasn't for me... they wouldn't know how to handle it. I brought you pancakes. They've gone cold though. Don't sweat it. Pancakes. I have killed a monster! Now what? Not again? You are the monster! What is it with you knights? Always sorting things with your spears... Stabbed! - Van, calm down. - How do you calm down here? Third generator. In a week! Huh! All! - Dead. - Just pour Healing Water on it. It's never going to end. They keep arriving every day, for that... - knight's tournament. - Van. Everybody... nothing to see here! You can go... my dear. And take this. Van. Van... You didn't have to go off on him. He was just trying to save us. - I was too when I destroyed the first generator. - And the coffee maker. The television. You don't have to bring all this rubbish here. I'm actually doing this for you, for comfort... And to get used to them... before moving to my world, to get married... Ah! So if we don't move, we won't get married? - I don't mean... - Van! I don't want to move anywhere. This is my home. - And over there everything is terrible and confusing. - Oh yes... scary Wi-Fi! Cappuccino! Cinema! I just want you to... at least, experience where I came from. - Look what I brought you. - Hmm, you went to your world again. It smells like strawberry. - You like it? - Yes. I killed the talking stone! Come on. Come in, come in. Don't be nervous. So, tired. Do you want water? Father! Father, are you here? Gal, I can hear everything! Did you break something again? Ivan Ilyich, I was just wiping the shelf. It fell on its own. Right. The previous Galya was more careful. Do you want discount vegetables? No, there are enough vegetables. Maybe I get a couple more. That's all? Over there. I'm going to my father's... in the countryside. Hut! Give me wormwood. Hello, grandma. - What do you need? - I found an orphan... but she seems to have fallen ill. Look. An ancient darkness has befallen her. My advice to you... is to drown her. You are out of your mind, old woman! Buns are hot! Straight from the oven! Phoenix feather heals everything! It restores youth! We cut, we trim! We bring beauty! Fish! fish! Fresh fish! Come, have a look. Don't be shy! The freshest crayfish, dear. And what's with this rotten thing? What rotten thing? Wow, look! It moves! Whoa! Move? Of course it moves when you shake and wiggle it. Okay, mood killer, move along. You! Old man, are you interested? Soft birch bark, 40 rolls. It smells like coniferous forest, like the depths of sea, like strawberry. Next time I'll bring writing sticks. Keep it... free sample. All right. Vanyusha? Father. I'm here... looking at spears. So have you... decided to compete in the knight's tournament? No. How can I? I don't have a knight's strength. I can't cut down trees with my hands... crush stones. And then... Ivan was not afraid! He challenged the bewitched Dobrynya for a mortal combat! "I challenge you to a fight. Boy to boy!" - Draw out ... - Don't worry. When the time comes, the strength will arrive. I was 30 years old and I had spent waiting for 3 years. When will that be? The hour will come... Mother Earth will provide. All power comes from her. Listen, father, maybe I'm not a knight at all. Well... I mean, maybe I'm not like you, or like mother. What was she like? You never told. Well, what can I say? I couldn't save her. Van! Your Vasilisa is coming. I won't interfere. Van. Finist Clear Falcon has caught Miracle Yudo. Let's go see. Folks, witness the wild creature Finist the Clear Falcon has caught with his bare hands. No more running around the woods... eating people. If I knew I would encounter such beauty... I would have brought this monster yesterday. Hey, Finist Clear ostrich, did you know you caught a woman? I know. Is this your first woman? I'll teach you a lesson! Hey, how knightly of you to offend a woman. - Van, don't. - Not now, Vasya. So what? What are you going to do? Come on, Van. Tell me... are you finally... wearing the pants now? Well? How do you like the power of feminism? Hush, hush, daughter. It will pass soon. Come to me. I compel you. Obey me. Come to me. Darkness... awaits you. I hear you. I hear... you. Who are you? I am the one who filled you with darkness. And my name is... Rogoleb! Hello good people of White City, and knights of Belogorye. I see that you are ready to demonstrate your skills and powers. Therefore... I will not keep you waiting. Let it begin... the knight's tournament! Well, good man... Can you reach this well? Huh? Bravo! Bravo! - Vaskashi! What's the point? They'll get herniated disk. Back injuries. Finist! Finist! Finist! Come on sweetpie. Be my guest. Give me the next knight! This one is weak... He would be tested for doping. Vanyushka Muromets... Why are you sitting there? Come down here. Show us your skills. - Come on, Ivan! - Are you afraid? Can your fun contest wait five minutes? - I'll get changed and come back. Vanyusha! I'll show you, skinned peacock! How often do you go there? No, I... I decided to dress up. Retrieve clothes. Sneakers... Comforts. Well, two, three times... - per month! - Mm. - Five. - Mm. Okay, okay... every day. I can't live without internet! What about the sword, why doesn't it work? It's drained. What do you mean, drained? The power is gone. And when will this power return? Maybe there's a charger? In my lifetime, the sword has never lost power. Is it broken? Van. Van, don't go. It's a bad idea. When you finally have your power then you compete. - Wow, what's the matter? - 'Vanshka is weak. He won't make it.' - Van, what are you doing? - Nothing! I see you don't believe in me. Fine... Maybe you don't want to go to my world because you don't like me? Maybe I'm not right for you? - Van, are you stupid? - Oh, I'm also a fool. 'Ivan the Fool.' - Show us what you can do! - Come on, Vanyushka! Be brave! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! What should I do? The rope to you? Okay. I will grant you... great power. So that you serve me as I serve the darkness. What is your order? Wait... Wait for the hour when I get stronger... to be ressurected. Galya? I don't understand, what are you doing here? Oh, Vanyusha, I have business here. What business? You took my advance and disappeared. And what's with the outfit? Are you in the 'Battle of Magicians' reboot now? Where did this one come from? This cannot be. Where is the magic sword? Take them. Oh, it's time for me... to get out of here! Bring the sword. - The sword is in the tower. - Don't fail this, like last time. Thanks. Hey! Sword! She has the sword! Fenist, Fenist! I... I won't last long! Father, catch! The sword has no power. It's bewitched. Vanya! Run! The magic sword needs to be protected. Finist! You go with them. - And you? - I'll meet up with you! I'm getting wet. Soaked toast is disgusting... I hate it! Why you look at me like I'm your honey pie? Pfft. Please. Capture them! Failed again? All you had to do was bring the sword. Hut! What are you, a dumbass? Do you want to kill us all? - Sorry, I sneezed. - Then don't sneeze. Listen, what happened there? What were those roots climbing out? Why are Varvara and my cleaner Galya together? Do you know her? She cleaned my floors. What's all this about? An ancient evil has awakened. Why can't they all stay asleep? Varvara and this friend of yours, who rode the wolf. - Well. - They serve him. Who? It was a long time ago. There was a great sorcerer who lived among us in Belogorye. Everyone honored him, young and old. He was kind. Generous. Everything he touched came to life! Then one day... the sorcerer realised that he could die. So, he decided to become immortal. When the sorcerer was close to reaching immortality... To make it short and simple the sorcerer had a young student. Koschei, ready...spoiler alert.. the student killed the teacher. Right? I'm done, I'll be quiet now. I'll say no more. Koschei decided to turn to darkness. And let darkness into his heart. So he killed his teacher. That's how Koschei became immortal. And the sorcerer... buried for days and nights deep underground. For a thousand years he absorbed darkness. Slowly he began to grow... People he cursed came to me. There were many. No one survived. By then I knew... he was planning something terrible. Yes Yes. Now we know. Can we continue this story on land? Your hut has escaped. - And the eyeless knights are coming back here. - Where have you been? - Who? - You. - Me? - You. - I distracted them. - Distracted them. We need an escape route. Like a trip to Sochi on a banana. Nobody's here. Did you take a good look? You can check yourself. Burn it. Well, bubble, thank you. It was fast... Thank you. - We will continue on our own. - Take care of yourself, my little fish. Well, what are you waiting for? Follow me, stump. Hey! Is anyone getting me out of here? All my dough is numb being stuck on this stick. Ha! Chuppa-chups lollipop XXL! They must be here somewhere. What are we looking for? Your strength as a knight. A minute? - Did you tell him? - What? That I'm waiting for my powers. - Van, what are you saying? - I just told you about this. But this brainless gorilla already knows. Who is brainless? A gorilla is... a monkey.... a kind of animal. Ah! Is the animal like... a goat? - Yes, like a goat. - Van, why are you angry? 'I am a very strong and dumb person... No, no, Finist, you are very cool.' 'Even though you're so dumb...' 'You have the strength of a knight, not like this Vanya...' 'who only has a brain and a sense of humor.' Van... you look like a goat now. I found them. I found them. Over here. Pull it. Ah...you take this. Oh you. Half-cooked knight. I have to do everything myself. Well, don't stand there like a stump! Pull now. She woke up good. Pull! Whale! I thought they were extinct. We were lucky... This one went dormant in Bologorye 20 years ago. It's all great, yes. We're flying. Very scenic. But how will father find us? And, why are we fleeing from this sorcerer? We are going on a mission, yes, which will make us legends. We need Koschei. Only he knows how to destroy the sorcerer. What if he had died? Koschei is stuck in the Kingdom of the Dead. In the north. I heard the dead cannot return from there. In a thousand years many went there but none came back. It is certain death. Listen. If it's that dangerous, why are we going there? You don't have to go. We can manage without you. Am I right, Vasilisa? If you're afraid to go to the realm of the dead to save the country from darkness just say so. We'll drop you off. Stay put and wait. Haha. Well... Wait wait. I wanted to say... what... We all heard what you said. You were scared? Admit it. We must go and... risk our lives. - Yes, I you... - Yes yes... you don't have to say anything. We all understand everything about you. Let's not give in to Finist's cowardice. Granny... let's head to the realm of the dead. - Granny! - HUH? Yes. What did you eat just now... to lift the iron chain? Why are you asking? For general knowledge. Oh really. They're a type of berries. Usilika. What? - There is blackberry. - Yes. - And there's strawberry. - Yes. And there is usilika. What's not clear, ha? Mmm. Oh! I'm losing power. Finist! Help! - Let me help you, grandma. - Help. You better not get in the way, weakling. Grab hold. Gently... the whale likes it tender. You did it you bastard! Of course! I'm Finist... A knight. - You're not a knight... you're a gerilla. - Who? Gerrilla! An abomination! Long story short, you're a goat! I've been gathering strength for a thousand years to accomplish my goal... I was so close... And then you lost the sword! We needed help. How dare you contradict me?! Bring me back my sword. What are you doing, knight? She said don't drag her! I didn't! Is there anything I can do to calm her down? She's flying dangerously. - Pull towards you! - This whale is broken. It doesn't turn where it should. We have to get off. Come on, grandma. No, no. I'll do it myself. As you wish. Hey, don't forget about me. Van! Van! Jump! Van! Vanya. How did you manage to lift those rings? I don't know. Somehow... I suddenly felt the knightly power... came over me. Here, look. See, I'm the Hulk now. Idiot. So, Finist Clear penguin... You're not the only knight now. You know... Should we stop and rest? Let's rest up, eat and then continue. I'm hankering bread. What? Just eat the ice. Help me. Come on, knight. - Well, grandma... - Ha? - Where to next? - Where... There. How much farther, grandma? I'm not a white walker wandering the forest. Grandma! How much farther? Stop complaining. We are close. I can feel the cold grave. Everyone can feel the cold grave. Looks like we've arrived. So where is the entrance? Open sesame. Granny! Who are you? Uh... We would like to enter the kingdom of the dead. We need to find someone. It is forbidden to be alive in the kingdom of the dead. Many have tried... but everyone perished. We are not afraid! - Do you want to fight? - You want to pick a fight... with a mountain? I'll ask three questions. If I get the correct answers... the gate to the kingdom of the dead... will open. But if there are no correct answers... you will all die! Wait a second! What if the answer is not the most accurate, but it's roughly true, generally... Will this be considered correct? What are your rules here? For example, 'what, where or when', which one is important? Does this decide which answer is correct, and which one is not? - What about you? - Mmm, hey. One more detail! Can we discuss? How much time do we have to answer? - A minute? Two? - Are you ready to answer the question? Of course, we're ready! But, like I said, there are ambiguities to be cleared. Should we decide who will answer? Or can we all work together? - Do you have... what are the rules about this? - Only one will answer! - That's what I'm talking about. - There are four of us. Who shall answer? Me! Me! Then listen... I'm sorry, but can you explain a little more? Who is on duty today? What? I asked who is on duty? In English. Finist! He is on duty today. I'll freeze you first! I understand. I'll be quiet. Listen to the first question! Stop! Stop! Stop! Guardian. To the first question, 'Are we ready to answer'? - I answered. Did I answer? - Um, yes. Answered. To the second question 'Who will give the answer?' - I answered it too. Did I answer? - Yes! Answered. And to the third question -'What?' I answered that too! So you're saying there is a fourth question, and we agreed on only three! So! By your own rules that you've established for ages... you have received three answers to three questions asked. Voila! Sim sim, open up. Let us through. You've played me. This crystal... will carry the death... of the person you wish to take. Thank you for your cooperation! If the crystal stops glowing... You will not be able to return... to the land of the living. I'm going. If I die... write a legend about me. Why are you calling the shots? Whoever got the crystal will go. There's a chasm! What do I do? Maybe jump down? Grandma, are you insane? What? What? Come out, let me do it! Me, me. Always with your me! Okay... calm down. Breathe... it's not that hard. I give the stone, I take Koschei, I go back. Aha. Okay... just in case. Hey! What's taking you so long? Since when are you clever? You must think carefully first- understand... Father? Vanya... don't get off the boat. If you come to shore... you will stay here forever. What are you doing here? Didn't we agree to meet up... later. We meet here. Now, father... Don't you dare step off! But, father... Look. I have this thing which can get one person out of here. Hurry. Come to the boat. before the light goes out. No Van... my journey has reached the end. It's your journey now. Go through it with honour. You are a knight. You can do anything. Father, what's the matter with you? Come on, get in. The two of us must save Belogorye. You don't need me to save Belogorye. - but Koschei. - No! Father... come on. Come on, before it... goes out. Father, get in. We can come up with something. Don't leave me. Let's. Take care of yourself, Vanya. Father! Give it to me! Father, now. - Now. - Forgive me, Vanya... I wasn't able to tell you much. Vannya. - Guardian! - Van. Wait! Hey, you! You stupid head! Open up! I will answer all questions! Open up! Van. Shouldn't we look for the fugitives... not their rags? If you want to look, go. Find me Ivan. So quiet. Is your tongue frozen? Bony! Why so quiet like you're a stranger? Don't you recognise me? No. Who are you, mother? I'm not your mother... you rotten stump. I am Yaga. This is Ivan. This is Vasilisa. Then who am I? Rotten stump? You are Koschei! You broke the crystal that had your death and you saved Vanya. Don't you remember? Fool! That's right. I'm Koschei. Some help they pulled out! Koschei... we need to know how you defeated the sorcerer. Your teacher. I don't remember any sorcerer. We traveled a thousand miles to find you. I'd frozen all my crumbs. Remember! I remember. I remember the sorcerer. Remember the rest, you bag of bones! Well... how did you defeat him? Defeat him... Defeat... using a magic stone. What kind of stone is it? Where is it? In the White City. I say we don't go any further. I should have saved my father. So we're going back. Koschei-ling Did you know... you're my servant? Or have you forgotten that too? Servant? I don't remember that. Fool, I remember. You will carry me on your back. Come on, come on, I've no strength left. My hut. How is she now without me? She must be suffering... Take it, Koshchei. It contains your death. Don't lose it. Come on, move. You're in the way. We've reached home. So? Where to now? Koschei, where is this magic stone? I don't remember. Somewhere in the city. Don't pull our legs, you bastard. Where in the city? Come on, remember, bone bag! The stone is beneath the tower. Do you notice he remembers every time you hit him in the head? That's right. Oh, you'll remember everything! Beneath which tower? Huh? Under the tower... It was a thousand years ago. I cast a spell, threw the stone off the tower and hit the sorcerer. Go on. The stone contained his life. What are you doing? I'm not your servant, old woman. - I remember. - You broke my spoon. Listen. There is a stone on the square of White city. That must be it. If the sorcerer's life is in that stone... - we just have to break it and it will be over. - Aha. A glorious legend that would be. Finist enters the White City. And raised the mace over the sorcerer's stone. Only a magic sword can cut that stone. Ivan has it. - It's time to go... save Belogorye. - Yes. A great exploit. Ugh! This bone bag... broke my last spoon. Who will fix it now? - What? - Here's the thing, actually... the sword doesn't work. It's drained. How is it drained? Well, the magic is gone. After I opened the entrance to my world, it simply... - stopped working. - Why? I don't know why. It was working fine and then suddenly... it malfunctioned. So because of you... it's drained? Because you keep going to your world? How would I know it would break? Maybe... we need to wait. It might work again. How long? I don't know. Let's wait for darkness to fall. It's easier to enter the city at night. That's just great. I can... get a snack. You hot bastard! How darkness fell on the Russian land... and the clouds thickened over the White City... They came out of the dense forest... - and sneaked into the city covered in darkness. - Who wants cappuccino? Me, me, me. Oh, cappuccino. And Finist Clear Falcon effortlessly... - split the magic stone in the square. - It's okay, the sword has recovered. Recovered and you immediately went to get cappuccino? - the curse of a thousand years... - So? - I wanted to cheer myself up. - was saved... - from destruction. - Well... with the magic sword, I can enter the city myself... and maybe get you new diapers? Diapers. Sounds delicious. Is it some kind of bird? Me, me, me. Me, me. He defeated all the evil powers... and destroyed the enemies of Belogorye. And they write legends about Finist. A glorious hero... of his land. Well. We can rest until it's dark. Kill them all. I’ll tear you to pieces. There'll be nothing left of you. Van, the sword. - Faster! Not the heroic death I expected. Oh you! You fool! That's how you got your strength. You stole my usilika? Ha! We can't fight back. We have to leave. Leave them. The magic sword is here. Did we lose them? I think we did. - What were you thinking? - Tyuryukhaylo! Didn't anyone teach you not to take other people's things? - In what sense? - 'In what sense!' - I didn't do it on purpose. I wanted to help! - Help? Why did you do it? To get your knight's power? - How can we trust you after this? - What do you want from me? Van, I don't know what to expect from you. Tomorrow you might run away to your world again. - And you won't come back. - What do you mean? Because you already... escaped 'Knight'. That's right. Who would doubt... you prefer a knight. - What? - Am I wrong? You think I haven't notice how you look at him? Obviously, I'm not that strong. Nor smart enough to fly to you as soon as you wave your hair. That's right. I would give more. Can you argue some other time? This one won't last long. There is Healing Water in the city. What are we waiting for, fools? Lift him. - Maybe it's better... - You've said enough. Koschei, come on. Return to the city. Hey! We're leaving. Hey, wait for me! Come on. So you decided to run. Give me back my sword! That's how it is. Why didn't you go with them? You could have squeezed through. Didn't leave, didn't leave. None of your business. When my grandmother baked me, she forgot about me by the window. Then my grandfather dropped me to the ground. Nobody needed me. I wandered the White world alone. I hardened. I began to rob and steal cattle. People hated me. Only you... stretched out your hand to me. I also grew up alone. Listen, I wanted to ask... about the fox. Is it true? She didn't eat you? (Russian folktale) I chased the red snout through the woods for two days... until I got hungry. Since I messed things up, I have to fix it. We need to get the sword back. Fool. - He will destroy you. - Better to die than be like you. I do not serve him. but darkness. Then continue serving it. I should have drowned you then. We couldn't find the sword. We searched everywhere. Search again. Search thoroughly. This is the plan. Bring back the sword... cut this magic stone with the sword... Root enemy dies. We find everyone. I apologise and everything will be fine. Sure. And how exactly are we going to do all this? As if the magic sword would drop from the sky towards us. My beauty... Bring it to me. Drop it. Please. 'There is only you in my destiny' 'Rodna... my love and pain.' 'We met with you.' 'Rodna my woman.' Knock Knock. Is anybody home? Ugh. It's harder after eating chicken. "All for you, dawns and fogs." "For you the seas and oceans." "Flower fields for you... for you." "Only for you the stars burn in the sky." "Our crazy world was created for you." "I live for you and I under the sun... for you." Lie down warrior, you are still weak. Here it is! The stone! It's not the magic stone! Koschei, remember where the stone is! How can I remember? Ivan, that's the cursed stone. The sorcerer's life is inside. - Where? Point it out. - I can't do that right now. Ha, ha! Tough isn't it? The story of my life. Bon appetit, ball. Why did you ruin it? It was a perfect throw. I timed it so he would bounce off the roof and... I remember now. You shouldn't cut the stone. Stop! Asta la vista, baby. - The stone keeps him underground. - If you break it, you'll set him free! Too late. How long have I waited for this. Darkness reigns again. Hey! Stump! I'm sorry to interrupt your... meeting with this Gorgonzola. But I have this thing... it's this. How dare you turn the magic sword against me? I forged it. I gave its power. I am its master! Koschei, what is going on? Are you working for him? No, Ivan. I realised the truth too late. Koschei? Is that what they call you now? Did you give yourself a new name? Mikula? So you are not Koschei. But Mikula the Immortal? Belogor, forgive me, I was young. You remember my old name. There is no more Belogor! You had condemned him to bury underground for a thousand years. He rotted away, forgotten by all. They'd forgotten the kindness... he showed them. Now there is only... Rogoleb! You are wrong. There is still Belogor in you. Just like Mikula remained in me. And it's him, not Koschei... who gives you his life. You can kill me... if it quenches your anger. But let them go. Death... is liberation. How clueless people are to the simple truth that eternal oblivion... is much scarier. So enjoy your immortality! You will lie underground forever! Well, here begins 'The Tale of... how Finist the Clear Falcon overcame the darkness. Get her. Hey Belodrish! Take your roots off her! Submit to me. Oh, you, overgrown weed. I'm got an axe now... we'll see who wins. Don't, Vanya. You cannot defeat Rogoleb. He is not your enemy. Not my enemy? When he's trying to strangle my future bride to death? Listen, Galya... leave here! Get rid of it! They told me there is darkness in you. But there's only foolishness in you. Hello son. What is this? Am I dead? Mother Earth will decide that. She is the power of life and death. From her springs power both good and evil, and she decides everything. When darkness appears, so does a shining knight. Everything has a balance. Does this mean the power... comes from the earth? Why didn't I have the power, when I needed it the most? This I don't know. Maybe... it's too early? You weren't ready to receive it. It doesn't matter anyway. Now that I'm dead. It doesn't matter... whether you died or not. What matters is what is worth living for. Think. Vasilisa. She is definitely worth living for. And those annoying six. Kolobok, Baba Yaga, Koschei, Belogorye. And memories of you, father. If the earth gives me strength... it gives you strength too. His power is from the ground. - We must rip out the roots. - That can sorted. Finist, release Kolobok. What took you so long, Beard? Hey, hey, where are you throwing me? Hey! Rogoleb! - Understood? - I understand, I understand. Toss away! Ugh! Ha! Tastes like rotten chicken. Where is this? What kind of sorcery is this? This is what a city looks like. What sorcery? This is Moscow, man! Only asphalt and concrete. Here the earth gives no power. Dig as much as you want. You'll only find more underground floors. It's a long way from Moscow to Mother Earth. That's the power of concrete and asphalt. Know this... I am darkness. Darkness is everywhere. Even in you. Whoa! Haha. Dried root. - It's one of those days in the city huh? Where is Ivan? He fell into the portal, with Rogoleb. An excellent knight. An honorable death. Van! I am going to clean the soot out off her. It's over, Galya. Your root is out of the game.
