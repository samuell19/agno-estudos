"BLACK ANGEL" "March 25th, 1945 Year 23 of the Fascist Era." Hurry! Can't you go faster? The road's a mess. The car's doing the best it can. I promised your husband I'd look after you. You promised me something too. Don't worry. Our pact still stands. Our wicked pact. Livia, I want you. I can't wait to get to Venice. I know, but drive faster. The sooner you get me to Helmut, the sooner I'll honor our pact. You'll be with him today, and so today... Yes, don't talk anymore. Just drive. Let me rest for a while. Yes! So it's true, with some man off the street. And after, not knowing what to do... How to ask? Nothing, eh? It's true. It's true! It was the disgust, the horror of that vain, obscene attempt... Perfect. Perfect. Crying now? Why? At this point, no. Let me go now. What are you saying? Why? Now that you know this... But I knew already! How could you? I figured it out. I'm so ashamed! No one move! Any spies or fascist traitors in here must come out now! There's partisan lead for them! Venetians! Time is almost up for Hitler and the fascist traitors. Fight alongside us for national liberation and to crush Nazi-fascism once and for all! Death to fascism! Freedom for the people! Long live the Front for Youth! Ladies and gentlemen, good evening and enjoy yourselves. No one move. The theater is surrounded. Give it to me! I said, give it to me. It's an order! I won't give you a thing! You could have taken them from those men onstage! Slut! Cover yourself up. This isn't a whorehouse! The lady is with me. Give the leaflet back to her! Let's go. It's not allowed for... Of course it's allowed! Everything is now! Who is that lout? It. Helmut Schultz, of the German Film Unit here in Venice. A lecher who does what he wants. How's that possible? If you get the actress Lida Baarova into bed with Goebbels, anything's possible. Lieutenant. They're characters, these Italians. I realized that he'd done it for me. I felt his pressing desire between my legs. I felt it like I'd never felt a man before. His stare had violated me. I didn't back away. I wasn't ashamed. I had an orgasm. What did Ugo mean about Lida Baarova? She was Goebbels' mistress until Hitler made him give her up. What's It. Schultz's involvement? He was her escort. Escort? Yes, you know, he was pimping for Goebbels. And now? Didn't you see? He's a stud who fucks them all! How come you know him? Because he represents Germany at the Minculpop and Istituto Luce. He and I sign the agreements for newsreel exchanges with the Germans. Are newsreels the only things you exchange? No! Don't do it. It meant he wanted to make love. My husband only got aroused if I kept my stockings on. I'm keeping on good terms with him because it's all falling apart here. See what happened at the theater? We must prepare for the aftermath. Understand what I mean? Reciprocal favors. Ugo and I are taking steps... Friends, enemies. Everyone's got interests to safeguard. Helmut is one German that could prove useful maybe just because of his vices, eh? Turn off the lamp. There's the anti-aircraft searchlight. It's a beautiful night. There's a full moon. I enticed him up behind me so as to avoid looking in his face. That night, I couldn't have stood the sight of his hairy nostrils or his expression as he took me. What vices? What? What vices? You said Schultz could be useful because of his vices. Oh, yes, I meant that since he's amoral, cynical, a gambler, a degenerate, with women too... Why all this interest in him? I couldn't care less! Darling, you're so wet. Gorgeous, dirty sow. Like it, slut? Tell me truth. You like it, eh? Come on, tell me! Why had I married Carlo? If I'd ever loved him before, I certainly didn't now. I was also certain of another thing that thrilled and scared me. My body, my flesh, my senses desperately wanted Helmut. Like a bag, ma'am? Why not? Two liras. Hello, grandma! What does he want? Thank you. Hey, you little turd, stop there! What do you say, men? I haven't done anything to you. Did you hear? He hasn't done anything to us. If he says he hasn't done anything, well let's snip it! Now get out of here! Don't forget the lesson! Too many here are dancing while the Fatherland weeps! Pay no attention. They're crazy. Your change. Keep it. My heart skipped a beat. I'd craved to see him again, but at the same time I was scared it would happen. Without even looking, I sensed he was following. Blood rushed to my head. Like me to hold that for you? I must talk to your husband. He's not at home. No, no... You don't want to? No one's forcing you. I didn't know how to pull away. I didn't want to. I felt my submissiveness arousing his senses. I'll tell you again, you're free. See, you're mine! Ah, it's you, ma'am. It. Schultz is here for my husband. Of course. Excuse me. I love you. Go. Go. I loved him too. Yes, I loved him. Bloody hell! What is it? - A roadblock. - A roadblock? Partisans... Keep calm. I'll handle this. Turn of the motor and get out with your hands up. I have a safe-conduct. Cornelia, check the car. The rest of you, watch the road. Bora, search them. - Negative. - Relax. Now the woman. Negative too. May I smoke? Who are you? Where are you from? Where are you going? From Asolo to Venice. I'm Ugo Oggiano, a lawyer. This is my sister. Papers. Minculpop. Fascists, eh? Apparently. I have an affidavit. - What do you mean? - I'll show it to you. Let's see... "The bearer of this document has our guarantee." All right, you can go. - Thank you. - For what? We weren't expecting you. Move that tree! Found anything? Just this. Mauser 1936. A collector's item. German, but republican. It went through the war in Spain with the 5th regiment. Go! Red wins! Fanatics. We've got to make up the time they made us lose. Just wait, Bora. Just wait! Many will win when the right time comes. You'll see. Got a cigarette? I really need one. In my inside jacket pocket. One for me too. Matches? Left pocket. There's a partisan in my family too. My cousin Tommaso. An ex-army captain. There's been no word of him since September. Is he in love with you too? I think so. And you? No. He's too idealistic and virtuous. The opposite of Helmut. The exact opposite. I'm scared, Mario. Vito knows about us. Don't worry, Elsa. I'll handle your husband. No, Vito! Don't do it! I've redeemed my honor! This one's good! Well done! The master's good. We'll do close-ups next. In the meantime, let's raise a glass. "Betrayal." Well done! "Cinema is the strongest weapon." Friends, a toast to Betrayal! Long live Mussolini! The first take of this film in the new fascist and republican Scalera studios is a victory made possible by the recovery in Poland of a large part of the equipment erroneously exported by Cinecitta studios. Much merit for this goes to the generous support of It. Schultz, whom I urge you all to include in our toast! And you, Helmut? Would you kill for honor? What's honor? Lieutenant, a German soldier who doesn't know what honor is? Something to do with the military? And for love? Would you kill for love? Husbands kill lovers. Not the other way round. Isn't that right? Just as well. Also, husbands are more useful alive than dead. True, Lieutenant? From the way that slut was looking at him, I knew she'd been in his bed. I felt like I was dying of jealousy. The idea that their affair might still be going on drove me crazy. Aren't you feeling well? Just a slight headache. I have some pills in my dressing room. They're very effective. Come with me. Come on. Let's go. I'll come with you. Tell your boss that I appreciated his toast. My compliments again. The pills are on the table. Helmut? Yes? Lock it again when you've finished. It's a marvelous film. It'll be the masterpiece of Scalera studios. I didn't understand a thing. The gnawing jealousy of a moment ago had become a violent sexual excitement. Are you jealous? To death of all the women who look at you. Even of Elsa? Yes, of course. Why? Maybe I should be the jealous one. What do you mean? I'll explain another day. There's no time now. Are you free on Sunday? I think so. We'll meet at 3:00 at Nemo's. Do you know it? The shop that changed its name from Memo to Nemo. That's the one. You'll be there? At all costs. Kiss me again. This time I have something doubly exciting: Form and content. If you say so. Let's see. What a strange place. I didn't imagine it to be like this. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Shame it's empty. These days they break everything. Sit down. I want you to look at these too. When we leave here, I might not have them anymore. Strong stuff. Who is it? What? Don't you recognize it? I'm surprised at you. George Grosz! How could I? Isn't he one of the "degenerate school"? Did you kill him, by any chance? No, unfortunately. He escaped to America. Lucky him. I was upset. The men and women in those pictures were obscene, but something about them excited me. I had the impression that Helmut had dragged me into a whirlpool of perversion. They're marvelous! Really marvelous. That's why the man who did them was persecuted. 15,000 liras for the lot. You're a real scoundrel. That's a really Jewish price! Ex-Jewish, Lieutenant. I changed my name and was baptized a Christian. You should be reported. If you report me, who'll buy your watercolors next time? All right. 20,000. But you're still a scoundrel! Just like you, Lieutenant. Agreed. 20,000 liras. What will you do with it? What will I do with it? Simple. I'll use it to get out of the war. One day, two days, a week. There 20,000 liras for a week of desertion. Lieutenant, if you want your money, push me over to the safe. For 20,000 liras I can afford to be pushed by an officer of the 3rd Reich. What did he mean? Strong, handsome, perverse, filthy I liked him. Till next time. Shut the door behind you, please! Lieutenant, your briefcase! Keep it. It's included in the price. A memento of Dr. Goebbels, as a gift from me. Wait! One day, two days, a week. Do what you want to me. Against me, inside me. You liked my watercolors, eh? They seemed like your husband and his friends with their women. No, not me. I'm not like that. I could only do that with you... No, not you. Of course not. But they excited you. Oh, yes. Feel. Yes, I can feel it. I was at his mercy. No one had ever touched me like that. With the tip of his finger, Helmut had made me his slave. Take me here, now! Go! Run! Gino! Gino! Gino! Maria! Get back! Roundup! Stay here. Mama! Come away! What happened? The war. I wanted to bury my face in Helmut's chest. I didn't want to see, hear, or think. I just wanted to have him. Suddenly it was clear that only Helmut gave sense to my life, the sense I'd never found before. Come here, stupid! The sky was gray, but it wasn't cold. Helmut insisted I went with him to the beach by the hospital on the Lido. Can't you see it's raining? What do I care about the rain? We were alone with the sky, rain, sand, and sea. I felt immensely free: Without rules, duties, or shame. What are you doing? Who was that man? - A doctor. - Are you sick? No, I'm fine. What did he give you? - Money. - And you? - Vials. - Of what? Morphine. Removes pain; Brings oblivion. Will you forget me too? No, I'll never forget you. I want to forget other things: The rules, the uniform, the war. I'd die if you forgot me. Wait. It's stopped raining. The sun's come out. Come on. Let's take a dip. I finally felt that Helmut would be mine. I wanted him with my whole being. I wanted his body. I wanted to feel him inside me. Don't move! Because it's never been bombed, Venice is like a free port. Thanks for Chanel No. 5. Everything's on the black market. Even morphine? If you can pay, even morphine. Cocaine too. Who uses them? Lots of people. Maybe even people you know. For example? Actors. Some actresses too. Especially cocaine. Careful! Good Lord! We need more light. Can't see a thing here. My husband's lamp, maybe. And how! Carlo? At your service. May we use your lamp? Rosa needs more light. Of course. I'm off to the Giudecca. Would you get it off my husband's desk? You know where it is? At the end of the corridor. Thank you. I have an appointment at the Scalera with It. Schultz. A strange chap, that German. Why? Yesterday he told me about going swimming in the rain at the Lido. What's strange about that? Nothing, but it was the proposal he made. What proposal? The recovery of film rights in Germany that we haven't collected in two years, against a payment of 100,000 liras. Who must you pay? SS It. Helmut Schultz, obviously. How much are you owed? A couple of million. An advantageous proposition. There's no doubt about that, but can I trust him? Don't you? Well... The Lieutenant certainly needs money, and he's definitely unscrupulous. He doesn't believe in the Fuhrer anymore, if he ever did. He likes to live it up, not play the hero. I don't know. What would you do? I'd trust him. Maybe you're right. He needs us, and we need him. That's better. Aren't my wife's feet beautiful? And her thighs are even better. The most beautiful in Venice. I felt Carlo's eyes on the mark Helmut's teeth had left. Did he suspect something? I wasn't scared. On the contrary, I grew bolder. I'm sorry, but duty calls. Good-bye, Rosa. My respects, sir. What did Carlo want? To let me know he'd go along with my game, as long as I went along with his? Or did he want to provoke me? Still working at the Savine? Yes, we're building torpedo ships. We're at the watch factory, making fuses. We're extras at the Scalera. Venice acted as pimp to our love. I didn't care about anything or anyone. I had no remorse about betraying Carlo. I didn't feel guilty about making love with Helmut. I loved him even more. The first time we stopped in front of that door, my legs trembled, not with fear; With excitement. It was the secret lair that Helmut had rented at the Giudecca. Ah, it's you. Hello, Lieutenant. Hello. I can't stand it anymore. Not here. Wait. Helmut, put it inside me. Now it's your turn. Drink. Who was that woman downstairs? - A money-eater. - Meaning? The landlady. For this rat-hole and her silence, I have to pay and pay. Know what I risk if my superiors find out about this house? I'll pay for everything from now on. - I cost a lot. - How much? A lot. Gambling debts, bribes to keep me from the front, and all the rest. I told you. I'll take care of everything. Very exciting. I, Helmut, am being kept by you Livia, my mistress. Like Alexei Orlov and Catherine of Russia. Yes, very exciting. No. Just one. It's so peaceful. If you betray me, I'll kill you. I don't like guns. What kind of soldier are you? Don't you know war is waged with guns? Exactly. I don't like war either. Oh, no? What do you like then? You know very well. I want to hear you say it. Your ass. To fuck in the ass! To fuck the whole world in the ass! Fuck Hitler! Fuck Mussolini! Fuck Stalin! Livia, I'm drunk on your ass! Fuck the generals! Fuck the priests! Fuck the bosses! I want to go crazy in your ass! Tell me it's drunk! Say it! It's drunk. I can't hear you! Say it louder! Yes, it's drunk. My ass is drunk on you! My insides and my brain were frenzied with delight. Helmut had taken me beyond myself. He had shown me desires I didn't know I had. I had broken through the limits, crossed over the line. We need to be more active and not sit around anymore. Time's running out for Hitler and Mussolini. The storm's upon us. We've got to get through it unharmed. At the same time, starting right now, we've got to reemerge. Come back to the surface, as worthy types, if that's possible. In June, Carlo will be 69, 28 years older than I... Quite a few. Just Helmut's age. I'm handling the allied "Rocky" mission, not to mention contacts with the Curia mediators. In Switzerland I saw Count... Later, Emilietta, we'll ring. Count Leoni and he told me he's turned over gratis the majority of his "Gazetting' shares" to moderates in the CLN, and to keep his irons in the fire, he's giving millions to our friends in the Resistance. Yes, all right, but he's rich. So are you. You could do it too, if you wanted. What does that mean? For example, if the Minculpop gave you three million to produce three new films with Astra Productions... Which will never get made, naturally... Exactly. The Astra people will get the money to those partisans whom it's wise to support. I could stomach those repulsive men only because I knew I'd be making love with Helmut the next day. We can definitely do it. Ugo, fix me up a meeting with Mezzasoma at Salo tomorrow. There's another problem: Salvaging the film equipment from the Giudecca and Giardini when the Germans move out. All taken care of. We've got connections too: Col. Langhans of the technical divisions in North Italy, and It. Schultz, German representative to Minculpop and Istituto Luce. Trustworthy? Langhans, yes. Schultz, no. Why not Schultz? Recently, he procured some morphine for that hospital by the sea. He did it even though he knew it was for wounded partisans. He did it for money. He'd sell his own mother for gambling and women. We can corrupt him, but so can everyone else. It. Schultz is desperately seeking a way out of the war. Yes, but he has no principles. It's best we steer clear of him. They're bombing Marghera again. The allies should be more careful of the installations. They'll need them soon. You're radiant tonight. Why are you against Helmut? I'll vouch for him. I say this because I love you: He'll betray you like he's betrayed other women and his own kind. Forget him; He's a coward who only loves himself. I'll report him! Careful, Ugo. If you hurt Helmut, I'll kill you. Livia, Ugo, come here. What are you doing in the dark? I had to put Helmut on the alert: Warn him, help him, protect him. Next to those masters of deceit, the corrupt Helmut suddenly seemed like an ingenuous, defenseless boy. Try your luck! Luck is youth's friend! The Victory Lottery! Why was Helmut so late? Maybe I'd misunderstood the meeting place. Maybe he was at the apartment. Who is it? It. Schultz isn't here. Are you sure? I just took clean sheets up. I'd have seen him. Did he leave a message? No. You know what men are like. What are they like? Full of craziness, especially when it's about women. I was going mad. My heart was bursting with jealousy. Don't worry. He's not a bad sort. If he said he'd meet you, he'll show up. Wait at the tavern. When he comes, I'll call you. Will you really? I won't move from the window. Thank you. Look at that. 5 liras for the lot. 3 and we've got a deal! Hello. What can I get you? What have you got? These days, not much. Bitters, a spritzer. What's that? Wine, seltzer water, bitters, lemon. That'll be fine. Give me a kiss. Come on, Helmut. Where are you? What's happened to you? Got it! Shove it up your asses! Watch it. There's a lady here! Here you are? - How much is it? - One lira. - Your mirror! - Thank you. Your health! You can't do this! I was scared you weren't coming. That something had happened, that you were with... Another woman. Yes. Oh, Helmut, I'm jealous to death jealous of all of them! No women, they're not your rivals. But gambling is: A rival that damns my soul, clouds my mind, and empties my pockets. Swear it! Look. I had a copy made of the keys. This is for the entrance, and this is for the apartment. Now you can come and surprise me whenever you like. Here, they're yours. Let's go up. I want to talk. - They don't trust you. - Who? Ugo and my husband. They're up to something. Be careful! Carlo's gone to Salo. I can spend all night with you. Wait, Livia, we'll be together, but not here. - Where then? - Where they're expecting me. I must honor a gambling debt. That's why I changed uniform. Instead of scaring me, why don't you ask me for money? What have you got on you? 70,000, 80,000 liras. You're my salvation. I believe in a cruel God who created me in his image... This is yours. I was born from the life of a vile germ. I'm wicked because I'm a man. I feel the primordial slime in me. Do you like my party? Where's Helmut? Over there. Mussolini said, "The people are like women. They go with the winning man." The people are like queers! Long live Mussolini! Victory to the Axis! Helmut's lateness had thrown me into a panic. I realized I was entirely dependent on him. Even giving him money made me come. A card. Good-bye to your 80,000. What do I care? I'll have more tomorrow. In the meantime, I'm out of the game. Who says? I'll give you another chance. 200,000 against Livia. Winner takes all: The money and the girl. One roll of the dice. I'm game. Good girl, Livia. Thanks for the sacrifice. I won. She's all yours. Shall we go over there? Yes. My head felt light and free. Sounds and colors were magnified. Everything came into my brain without filters or obstacles. Everything seemed imaginary and real at the same time. I didn't care about anything. I would have done anything to please Helmut. I was his woman; He was my man. Elsa was just a dildo for our passion. My conscience dissolved into pleasure. You can go. I had to wait till curfew was lifted before leaving. Helmut went on gambling and losing. Elsa had lent him more money. I had the feeling that he was in the palm of her hand. It had to set him free. Move along! I've already seen four others. It's revenge for the killing of Badeschi. Don't look. Let's go. I said don't look. Oh, ma'am, it's you! The master came back last night. He was angry with me because I didn't know where you were. Ah, he's back. Where is he? In his study. Tell him I'm home. I'm going to change. Yes, ma'am. Of course. Would you tell me where the fuck you were? At your friend Elsa's place. I was surprised by the curfew. Know what they're saying about you? What? That you're a whore who does it with lechers! But it's not true, right? It's not the right moment to joke! I won't allow it! Certain relationships must be terminated immediately! You understand, don't you? You understand what I mean? I came back from Salé early because there's no time to lose, not just for me, but for you too. Get dressed and come with me. Your bath can wait. Our interests can't. All right. Play close attention. Press here and a false bottom opens. These are testimonials from the allies and the CLN. This is four million liras. Keeping it in Venice would be crazy. The city could become a trap at any moment. You and Emilietta will leave for Asolo tomorrow, to a villa that was requisitioned from its English owners. Ugo will go with you, and you'll stay there till the storm passes. It's just a matter of weeks, maybe days. And you? I have to stay here. I've got feet in both camps. You understand, right? When the time's right, I'll bring them together on the right side. I'm counting on you. Cover everything with stockings, panties, and slips, and lock it. When will I see you again? To just suddenly leave everything I'll join you as soon as possible. Go and take your bath. Then pack your bags. You leave early tomorrow morning. "I'm desperate. "My husband's sending me to Asolo. "We must meet immediately. "I'll expect you at my house at 4:00. "Carlo won't be here. I beg you, please come." I trust you, you know. Take this letter to the garrison commander at San Travaso. Ask for It. Helmut Schultz, and give it to him from me. But please, you must only give it to him. You know who he is. The man I saw at the entrance? Yes, that's him. Go! Go! And don't come back without a reply. I felt like I was dying. Leaving for Asolo, far from Helmut I was counting the hours, minutes, and seconds that we were apart. You're sure he said he'd come at 4:00?? Yes. See? - I'll get it. - No, I'll go. Darling, you're here! Come in! Come in! My husband wants me to leave tomorrow. He says events are coming to a head, but I don't want to go. I want to stay with you. You could hide me in your apartment. It's not possible. Your husband's right. His position here is too exposed. You'll be safer in Asolo. Don't worry. I'll come and see you. Swear you won't leave me! What are you saying? Don't even think it! It's a crucial moment for us all. I'm doing all I can to be rid of this. You want to desert? I want to get out. There's a group to help men like me. Oh, yes, darling, do it. It's not easy. They're not philanthropists. - It takes money. - How much? Lots. At least a million. Darling, don't move. Stay here. I'll be right back. Look! Darling! I love you! Take it! Count it! I don't even know how much it is. I'd never knelt before a man like that before. Giving him the money increased my excitement. Mad with joy, my throat welcomed the boiling spurts of his orgasm. Helmut was mine. Our destinies were intertwined. I needed him; He needed me. It's blown. We're on foot. And so? Nothing... we wait for a car to pass. - For how long? - Not long, hopefully. Let's get the car unloaded. I have to disappear for a moment. Be careful not to slip. Hello, my car broke down. Can you give me a ride? Who are you? Where are you going? Venice. Who goes there? Who's she? One of us. She's with me. Bigwigs from Minculpop. Get in! We're going to Venice too. Here we go! One, two, three, hup! On duty? Us two, yes. He's going home. On leave? Wounded. I'm sorry. At least for him it's all over. It'll soon be over for everyone. What do you mean? We'll be "the ones who lost." They'll be "the ones who won." That's why we're scarce. Everyone's changing sides. As long as whoever's left doesn't end up like that. Emilietta! Emilietta! Where are you? Stupid little servant! What was I doing in the labyrinth of that empty villa? Without Helmut, the peace in Asolo filled me with anguish. I hadn't heard from him in two weeks. I was raving like a nymphomaniac in a cage. "The strange weight of his testicles between his legs. She felt again the slow and fatal rise of his phallus." At 16, I was already masturbating over these pages. Maybe the villa's English mistress did the same. Maybe not. In Asolo they say she had an Italian lover. That's where she was, the sow. She hadn't wasted any time finding herself a good rod. For a moment I was attracted like a voyeur. Then I got hysterically jealous. Emilietta! Ugo! Finally! I haven't heard from anyone in 15 days. Keep calm. There's total chaos, but I've come all the same, and it wasn't easy. I've got news from your husband and... It. Schultz. "Darling Livia, I Kiss you frenziedly. "I'm going mad from the desire to hold you in my arms "and make you cry with pleasure. "You saved my life. "I paid doctors with your money. "Now I'm out of the service. "I've holed myself up in the apartment in the Giudecca Soon. "It. Herman Schultz will no longer exist. "He'll be away from the useless heartaches "of this lost, senseless war. "Then there will be only you, darling Livia, you forever, my one true love." Ugo, you're devoted to me, right? I love you. You know that. Then take me to Venice. Me? How can 1? I promised your husband. Choose: Me or my husband. What? You mean that... You understood perfectly. If you take me to Venice, I'll be your reward. We leave tomorrow at dawn. And us? When the mission's accomplished, I'll go to bed with you. Oh, Livia, thank you. What did I care about Ugo? If that was the price for going back to Helmut, I'd barter my body with anyone. Venice! We've made it! We're tired of war, and we want to go home. Engine driver from Treviso, oil your pistons. We're tired of war... We're splitting up here. I'm going that way. Can I go a little further with you? All right, what about this? Give it back to me at the hotel. All right, I'll wait at the Luna Hotel. Yes, of course. I love you, Livia. Don't forget it. Good-bye. Gino, I'm tired of hiding. What about me? Think I'm not tired of pretending? Why don't you come clean with your wife? Easier said than done, Rita. Pig. Bastard. You like it, eh? Stinker... Your balls too? Careful. I'll eat them! What do you want now? Shove it in. Wait. Wait. Like that. Go on, push! Well done, my big German. Was Livia as good as me? You're a thousand times better. Was she as beautiful as me? She was old, jealous, and dismal as the war! Liar! You told her you loved her! You know why. Without her money, you and me wouldn't be here now. Look who's here! Come in. I'll introduce you. Ninetta, Livia's here. You wanted to know what she was like. What do you want? You came to spy on me? You want to come to bed with us, beautiful lady? I'm sick of your jealousy! I'm sick of you! What do you want? You had the sex you paid for. That's it! I've got no debts with you. Don't you like the truth? Well, you've got to listen to it. The money you gave me was the price for my services. Love had nothing to do with it. I never loved you. You never loved me either. All you wanted was my cock! And you know it. Coward. Yes, I'm a coward! And thank God I am! If I'd been a hero, you never have been able to buy me! Coward! Run, run, your fucking ladyship! Get out of here, spy! And don't come back! Yes, you bastard, do it to me now! My cunt's on fire. Come on, you pig, give it to me. I've never come this much in my life! I want to die! I want to die! I want to die! I must speak to your Commander. Identification! Wait here! This is no longer a garrison. It is now SS headquarters. I must speak to your commanding officer. It's important. Follow me. There's an Italian woman who wishes to speak with Col. Pepper. A pass for the lady, quickly! Then take her to the Colonel. Leave that here and follow me. Colonel, Mrs. Mazzoni has arrived. Yes, Colonel. - Sit down. - I'd rather stand. Mrs. Mazzoni. What do you have to tell me? Hurry, I have no time to waste. Read this. It. Schultz is your lover? He's a traitor. And he dumped you. He paid doctors so he could desert. You're signing his death warrant! I've done my duty. Now do yours. Giudecca, Calle delle Convertite 23. - Third floor. - Good-bye, Mrs. Mazzoni. One last thing. If I should need you again, where can I find you? Hotel Luna. Show the lady out, and send in Major Brenner, quickly. Gastone, is that clock right? It's two minutes slow. It's 1:32. Keep me company. I'll buy. All right, Mr. Oggiano. Can I ask you a confidential question? Certainly. In your opinion, is it better to know everything or nothing about a woman you love? Nothing. Finally. I was scared you weren't coming. Why? I always keep my word. One for me too. And a cigarette. Your eyes have never been so bright. Another! Know why they're so bright? Love. Hate. You hate your husband? Why would I hate Carlo? He's so busy I can't even remember what his cock looks like. No, Ugo, I hate the man I loved. I told you to be careful. It. Schultz is a coward who only loves himself. Tonight's your night, Ugo. You're sublime extraordinary... sumptuous unique. Come on, Livia, let's go upstairs. Mrs. Mazzoni? Yes? From Col. Pepper. What are you going to do? I'm going to Lazzaretto Nuovo. I'll go with you. I know the way. No! I don't want to die! Fire! Take me, Ugo, here, now. Hurry. Livia, you're an angel. "26th March 1945.
