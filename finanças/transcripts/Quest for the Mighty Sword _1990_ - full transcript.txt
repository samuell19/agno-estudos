"Quest for the mighty sword" closed captioned This man has been found guilty of rape. He accepts prince ator's sentence. [ Horn sounds ] My son. I saw my death last night in a dream. An eagle flew above my bed. You will learn that men are powerless against the will of the gods. That is why I wanted you here with me today-- on the day of justice. The condemned have appealed to the justice of the gods. Prince ator has accepted their plea. He will spare their lives if they can overcome the divine power of the sword of the sacred graal in combat. Thorn, you gave me this sword to bring justice to men. Grant that it will once again guide my arm. Ohh! Auggh! When Thorn wills it, he will return to reclaim this sword-- either this sword or my life. Justice is needed more among men than among gods. So remember, son, whatever happens, this sword must belong to ator. Thorn: Ator! I recognize you, Thorn. Here I am. I'm ready. Before my people... Before my own son... I will not dishonor myself by surrendering my sword! No! Do not kill ator,thorn! He has shown wisdom in all his doings, and he has never offended you. He has always respected your will, and he has tried to create justice among the akili. You'll pay for this, dejanira! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! You will be imprisonedby fire until a mortal arrives and has the strengthto break through the flames. But on that day, you will lose the divine powerthat Thorn granted you, as punishment for havingpreferred a mortal to him. Poor dejanira. She's still servingher sentence, paying the price for having allowed herselfhuman feelings. What mortal would have the strength to overcome Thorn's fire? The man who willbe rendered invincible by the divine swordof the sacred graal. That sword belongs to me. My father left it to me! No, ator, not yet. Grindel has hiddenthe two fragments of the sword. And he will doeverything he can to break the promisehe gave to your mother, sunn. You-- you are grindel, aren't you? So, you know me. In that case,why are you afraid? Am I so ugly? No.ha ha ha ha! On the contrary,you find me disgusting! All women find the verysight of US repugnant. That is why wehave no children. No, you wouldn'thave cried out if I had been a handsome,blond prince. Ha ha ha ha! Especially now thatyou are a widow! I am sunn, Princess of the akili, wife of ator. Not any longer,my dear sunn. Not any longer. Now you are merely a woman. What do you wantfrom me? I have brought you the sword of the sacred graal. Why bring it to me? Only you can forge it and bring back its magic power. Its power is no use to me. I have my own power. It is for my son. You must re-forge it and give it to him on his 18th birthday. And why must I do that? Because it is destined so. Anyway, don't you regret not having any children? Raise him as you would your own son. Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha! But what aboutthe conception? The act of conceptionhas not been carried out. At least as faras i'mconcerned. Ha ha ha ha! Besides, I am entitledto ask you something in return. No, if you want to know, I never ask for anything. I takewhat I want! Can I do anything elsefor you? Yes. You can help me die. Death and beautyare unsuitable companions. Beauty soon fades in a widow. And the law does not allow that a princes's wife outlive her husband. The laws of menhold no sway in my cave. It is also the law of my heart. As you wish, but at least allow me to makeyour parting from this world a sweet one. Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha! Caw! Caw! Caw! Caw! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Are you sure I put in all the right ingredients? Caw! Caw! With this, death will come to youlike a sweet dream. Now I would like to be alone with my son. Soon I will have left this world forever. Soon I will be joining your father. We will watch over you together. From now on, old grindel will take care of you. And when the sword becomes yours, you will make the world ring with your exploits. Now sleep, my child... My son. Ha ha ha ha! Grindel gave heran erotic potion instead of poison. And for that onehideous embrace, the gods condemned your motherto eternal madness. Grindel... I'll kill him! Rest assured, ator, your revenge is not far off. So my motheris not dead. No. She wanders aimlessly throughout eressea, condemned to repeat her sin eternally in the most vile and depraved places. Why are youtelling me all this? Because you have been chosen by fate to accomplish great things. You must return to middle world. The path lies to the east, but it has been lost. You must find a way so the akili can return to their home. Don't worry, go on. Nephele: I will come back. Caw! Caw! I knew it! His head in the clouds, alwayswith his head in the clouds! And the nets are empty. Now what am I goingto bring the giant animals for their supper, eh? Your giants will eat well today. Good. I'm pleased, ator. Here, take this. Drink it. It will give younew energy. I'd prefer water from the river. I have a surprise for you. [ Crow caws ] Soon you will be eighteen. But I wanted to fulfill my promise in advance. Here is the sword of the sacred graal. [ Grindel laughs ] Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha! So, that's what you would have done if you had the real sword. I learned long ago that the race of man was not to be trusted. Since men came to this world, they have created nothing but evil and destruction in our land! You're like all men, ator. And when the moment comes for me to relinquish the sword, I'll know what to expect. Dejanira! It wasn't just a trick. I wanted you to see dejanira in the flesh. I have neverseen anything so beautiful! And she remains imprisoned by Thorn's fire. You are the only mortal who can overcome the divine flames. Where does Thorn keep her? When you have the sword, I'll show you where she is. [ Clang of hammer on anvil ] Ohh! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ohh! I'm going to kill you-- I don't trust youto be left alone anymore. You will regain your sight when I come back. Unh! [ Crow caws ] Caw! Caw! Caw! [ Crow caws ] Ha ha ha ha! Get up, beast! There's work to be done! I think I'll leave youin the dark a little longer. That way we'll avoidany nasty surprises. Grindel! Ha ha ha ha ha! Here--right in the middle. Caw! Caw! Caw! Caw! Caw! Caw! Nephele! Nephele! Where are you? Do you recognize this sword? This is the sword of the sacred graal! It will put an end to dejanira's punishment! Nephele! Keep your promise! Nephele: Follow the path to the east. Remember, ator. Every human, every animal, and every plant may conceal Thorn. Not even the sword is enough to defeat the king of the gods. I understand that now. What must a mortal doto free his love? You must free the treasure of the kingdom of the west and offer it to the gods. I'm ready. Nephele: My journey ends here, ator. Yours is still long, but you must travel it alone. And never rely on the gods to help you. Look at the remains-- that's what's left of those who tried to steal the treasure of the kingdom of the west. You still have time to escape your destiny. You know I can't escape. Dejanira is my destiny. The treasure is kept in the inner cave. But first you must overcome ider and erec. They're almost invincible. One attacks with his sword, and the other defends with his shield. But if you can separate them, perhaps you can defeat them. Goodbye, ator. I know I won't see you again, but who will show me the roadthat leads to dejanira? Your heart... And the glow of Thorn's barrier of fire. [ Clatter ] You are not real,my love... But soon you will be free. Great and powerful gods! I offer you the richest treasure in all the lands of the west! Ator. Yes... I am ator. Son of prince ator, who you once tried to save from Thorn. Now I'm here to save you. From now on, you will no longerlive forever like the gods. You will live and die like a mortal! [ Explosion ] It is the wrath of Thorn-- we must go! I may have lostsome of my immortality, but I brought secretsfrom the gods with me. You realize thornwill give US no peace. Love cannot be destroyed by force. When we reach the middle world, Thorn will stop chasing US. And it will never have to fear his magic tricks and deceit. And man's tricksand deceits? At least man's tricks are predictable. [ Exotic music plays ] I'’ll decide when the game is finished of course, why didn'’t you say so. I just did. Okay... okay, I heard you. It'’s all your fault, you bring bad luck It's not possible! It's not your day. It was you who insisted on playing. I'm sorry, but no money, no dice. Wait-- I'll bet the girl! She's mine, I paid for her! She's a good beast-- look! I'm sorry, I only play for money. No disrespect to you. Pick up those dice! Leave him be! Thanks, friend. It's real easy to play the hero with that. Get out! Out of here! Get out! Every time you come here, you bring trouble! It's not her fault! Not her fault?! Couldn't you have helped her? I couldn't. You just sat there. You will understand why,later, ator. Couldn'’t you have helped her? I couldn'’t you just sat there. You will understand why later. Who is he? He is ator, lord of the akili. His father, also called ator, was given the great sword of graal in order that ator might bring justice to his people and lead them back to their homein the middle world. He will be mine. You disappeared. You shouldn'thave been afraid. Why did you defend me? They were hurting you. That's part of my profession. Don't humiliate yourself. I have to repay you for what you did. What do you thinkyou're doing? I have to pay with the only thing I have. Please-- please. I don't want anythingfrom you. Why do youhumiliate yourself? Because that is the punishment the gods have inflicted on me. When doesthis punishment end? When a man looks at me not as a woman, but as a mother. What is your name? I am ator,prince of the akili. Mother? You knew. Yes, ator. I know the secretsof the gods. But now that I am mortal,i am not allowed to reveal them. Now your punishment is over, mother. At last you're at father's side. Beyond the swamps liesthe kingdom of the east, and further on liesthe path we seek. Do you really think a world can exist which is subject to gods different from our own? Even if such a thingwere possible, only the nameswould be different. Gods are the same everywhere. [ Grunting sounds ] Do you want to stop and rest a while? We can rest whenwe get out of here. What are you afraid of? The swamps are the hiding placeof the evil spirits. They are the spiesof the gods. I'm not afraid, ator. I just don't like it here because I don't likebeing spied on. Let's go. Where were you? I was waiting for you. Dinner is ready. Ha ha ha ha! Well, after what happened back at the tavern, I wanted to repay you. You don't seem the type to repay his debts. I've never had a debt before. I'm a cheat, remember? Ha ha ha ha ha! But there's one thing I regret. What? Well, that I don't owe you anything anymore. We'd have never gottenout of that swamp alive. No, that's not what I mean. It's just that, well, I don't have a reason to follow you anymore. Then stop following US. Join US... If you want. Where are you going? To the east. Why? To find the path back to the middle world. Aaah!!! [ Dejanira screams ] Ator, they were hagen's men-- soldiers from the kingdom of the east. You know no one is supposed to enter when I'm here, hagen. The importanceof the news I bring you forces me to disobeyyour instructions. I hope so-- for your own sake. It concerns dejanira. She has falleninto our hands. What did you say? In whose hands? If anyone has lifted a finger on her, I'll hold you personally responsible. We have done our best,your majesty. Where is she?Here. What? Here? In my castle? Oh, hagen, I don't know what I'd do without you. Take me to her at once. If you'll permit me,your majesty, I suggest you prepare yourselfproperly for the encounter. As you know,the first impressionis the one that counts. I suppose you're right. What shall I do, hagen? [ Woman screaming ] Aaah! That's enough for today. [ Bell rings ] I don't want those screams to disturb dejanira. Why were you so anxious for me to appear so proper? That's what you said, wasn't it? Are you afraid dejanira won't love me? It's only right. Dejanira is noordinary woman. It won't be easyto persuade her togive herself to you. Besides-- all I want to do is see her. You can hide me. Let me see her, hagen. Now do you understandwhy even a god wanted to marry her, hagen? I want all of my subjectsto be present at our wedding. Start makingthe preparationsimmediately. Everything will be as you wish, your majesty. But we have all the time in the world. We must make her forget ator first. It won't be easy. Ator again? I thoughti told you to kill him! Ator? Where isator? Your majesty. Be carefulwhat you say, hagen. Choose your wordscarefully. I'm not under your spell,like my brother. Ator will be yours, Princess, just as dejanira is prince Gunther's. Don't forget, Gunther-- until ator is mine, you won't lay a fingeron dejanira. Ator will do everything he can to get dejanira back. Don't worry-- he'll be here soon, verysoon. Now, with your permission... Well, they seemrelaxed enough. There's onlytwo guards. Ator: Dejanira! Ator, my love! We didn't want to start until you arrived. There is no need for weapons. It has all been a terrible mistake. Prince Gunther wants to apologize to you. It is a great honor for my master to receive ator, prince of the akili, in his castle. Tales of your deeds have even reached our kingdom. Enter, ator, and be seated at prince Gunther's table, so that he may repay you. Gunther's unfortunate sister, the Princess grimilda, has been kidnapped by an enemy. Our soldiers thought they found her when they saw dejanira. I can assure you they have already paid for their unforgivable mistake. So everythinghas been settled? My master is ready to Grant your every request if you will forgive the misunderstanding. We need suppliesfor a few days. You are as modest as you are brave. At dawn my servants will have everything waiting for you. I need them now. Your...mastershould not be insulted. We have far to go. Under the circumstances, your wish is my command. You're a genius. You're an absolute genius,hagen. I don't know how to thank you for finding sucha brilliant solution to our problems. I ask only to serve you still more, my prince. I want to lift the burden of government from your shoulders so that you can serenely dedicate yourself to the beautiful dejanira and to your works of art. Your wish shallbe granted, hagen. You know I haveno taste for politics. And anyhow, every rulerneeds a hidden accomplice. Right, hagen? Your majesty. Your life, my death-- what can we do? Those are the rules. [ Chuckling ] Is he alwaysunderfoot? What do you mean? Skiold saved our lives, then risked his own to free you. The honor of his deedsshould be reward enough. This doesn't sound like you. And your eyes are strangely cold. Did something happen in Gunther's castle? No, no, my love, it's only that I wantto be alone with you. Yes, but it's not up to US. Skiold's our friend, we can't ask him to leave. That would be wrong. Skiold? Skiold! Skiold! Skiold! Why?! Why, why, why?! Perhaps it is stilltoo soon, my prince. You must be patient. I'd do anything for her. I'd dedicate my whole existence to her. Bring her to me immediately! Bring her in! Release her! How can you do this to me? Why do you want to break my heart? I didn't need proof-- it was hagen's idea to test you. Wasn't it, hagen? But hagen was right, because you tried to escape, which is proof you'd betray me if you had the opportunity. Dejanira, swear you'll never try it again. I'll give you everything I have. I'll even give you my throne... In exchange for a little love. Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Take her away! Take her away! Only art never betrays. Look at them, hagen. My works of artnever try to run away from me. They're always therewhenever I want them. They let me touch them,caress them. Always the same,always smiling. Dejanira will neverleave me, either! You'll see, hagen! You're different. Something in you has changed. Are you saying youdon't love me anymore? Oh, no. Can a river stop flowing? Can the moon stop shining? Not loving you would mean not living. Not even the hounds of hell could steal my heart from you. You're wrong, ator.You are mistaken. Because I have stolenyour heart from dejanira. Even if only for one night, you have been mine,body and soul! You have given yourself to me-- grimilda, Princess of the kingdom of the east! Look at me, ator. You'll pay for this! Skiold: No! She's not worth it. Let her live--it will be a worse punishment. You knew. Dejanira would neverhave spoken to me like that. We have to hurry. Dejanira may be in danger. I think that dejanirahas nothing to fear for now. She's been kidnappedfor love. That's all the more reason to hurry! Are you quite certain of your decision, your highness? She will be mine forever.She will never escape me. And she shall be happy, because with my own hands I'll make hereternally beautiful. And she shall havepride of place, as her beauty deserves. Very well, your majesty. Everything is ready. Bring her in! [ Bell rings ] Leave US alone. What are you doing, you idiots?!Tie her up first! No! Now out of here, all of you! [ Gong sounds ] Let's... Remove this helmet. Nothing must spoilthe perfection of your face. I won't be ableto sculpt your soul, but it doesn't matter,because that belongs to ator. But your body will be mine. Don't be afraid,you'll be marvelous-- you'll be my...Masterpiece. But statues can't speak. How will I be able to answer your questions? I know, curse you,that statues can't speak! I wanted a real queen-- you force me to do this. Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha! Aah! Skiold-- take this... You might need it. Aah! Aah! Aaaah!!! Ha ha ha ha ha! Aaah! Aaaah!!! Ha ha ha ha! Ator is coming! [ Dejanira screams ] You will never kill me! I will become a statue... A work of art... A masterpiece--forever! No, not me! No! No!!! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha!
