The white snow falling on my shirtsleeves, Strong wind blows and makes the cherry flowers fall. Seems the fluttering white snow falls deeply into a love net. Tadeshina, I have a request to ask you. After Satoko grows up, she will certainly listen to Matsugae's words and get married. But before her wedding, You can let Satoko and someone she truly loves stay together for one night. I don't care who that man is, but Satoko must love him. But you cannot let Satoko stay virgin and marry the man that Matsugae chooses. This way, it will teach that rude Matsugae a lesson. This is what high society's way of revenge is all about. I understand, master. Just let me handle everything. The rapid stream obstructs the rock, one divides into two. No matter how far they're separated, sooner or later they will meet again. This is my favorite poem. Here, a present. Do you know this poem's meaning? Is it snowing? Today is so beautiful. Days as carefree as this one only comes few times during a lifetime. Are you talking about true happiness? That's too bold for me to speak. You're too greedy. Your desires are boundless. It can swallow you up like the devil. That's great. I'll be eaten up quickly & cleanly. You already have everything, what else do you need? I want things that are incomparable, although I don't even know what they are yet. You guys fed them too much. Come, open your mouth. We have guests. What brings you guys here? Hello. It's Kiyoaki-san, long time no see. What are you doing on the island today? I'm here to enjoy viewing the sky. Sky? What's so special about the sky? Kiyoaki-san is so interesting. Come, let's go. Who was she? She is the Ayakuras' big aunt, right now she is Yeshu Temple's chair. No, I was asking about the woman behind her. She is the Ayakuras' daughter. Ah, so she is Satoko. I've heard of her before, she's truly a beauty. Really? What's your relationship with Satoko? What relationship? How should I say it, we're friends from childhood. I once lived in the Ayakuras' home when I was little. Father wanted me to develop noble, graceful qualities. I see. So that's how it is. Honda, you seem to be very interested in her. No. This is really beautiful. What is that? It's a dog. A black dog's corpse. Oh my. Quickly, call the gardener to dispose and clean it. I'm sorry you had to catch such an ugly sight. Satoko-san! It seems like he didn't die until recently. Look, he's still warm. There must be a reason for me to see this. Let's help and bury him. I will get some flowers. Kiyoaki-sama, can you come and help? Why should we pick flowers for a dog? Kiyoaki-sama, look. Pretty things are born under an unlucky star. This is really pitiful, but it's only a bug. Bugs too have a life. Azrael (the Death God) will not overlook anything with life. Let's bury this butterfly together with the dog. What do you think about my friend earlier? He kept asking me about you. You two seem to be similar, you will definitely get along with each other. Kiyoaki-sama, how do you feel about me? What do you mean? Nothing special. Then do you know how I feel about you? God knows. You really don't know? If one day, I disappear suddenly, what will you do? Disappear suddenly? Why ask this kind of question? That child gives me a headache. I thought she has already made her decision. She's already 20 years old. Really is, making us worry so much. I know. What is Satoko-san unsatisfied with? Even though Ayakura is a high status family, they're declining. The Ayakuras possess future prospects for internal affairs. The terms are certainly good. I think so too. If she keeps declining, I don't want to care about her anymore. But the Ayakuras did help us, so we must stage a comeback for them. We must find a groom that she cannot refuse. What's so funny? Nothing. That's why she said she was going to disappear suddenly. Thank you for solving this riddle for me. Thanks. Thank you. It's so rare to see you here. I cannot stand this smell. You're really excellent at kendo. My only shortcoming is kendo. I cannot endure it. I hate these fellows' barbaric thoughts, I curse their narrow mind. I also hate those who worship general Maresuke Nogi. You too like to look for trouble. Honda, I have something important to say. What? Do you want to date Satoko-san? What are you talking about? Doesn't Satoko-san like you? Listen to me first. The other day my father asked me to play the billiards, and then told me something very interesting. Are you interested in Satoko? Not at all. Ah, I see. Then what kind of women are you interested in? Why ask me this? At your age, I had several women. I'm thinking about you also starting contact with women. I'll take you there another day ( We'll call a few geishas and have some fun. Or, we could also go to a brothel. My father believes that the age of female experiences critically shapes a guy's character & attitude. Then, father did something shocking. can I come in? It's so late. What do you want? What are you doing? What are you doing? Master Matsugae told me to do this. Now the important subject. If I wrote this incident in a letter, and mailed it to Satoko-san, with the brothel and the geisha experiences written on it... You're so senseless. I'm telling the truth. If you do that, Satoko-san will... she will feel humiliated. Wait, Matsugae! Now we wait to see the interesting things that will happen. There must be a reason why you're here. What reason? You're lying. You must be thinking about doing a joke on someone again. Whenever you lie, your mouth becomes lopsided. Just like your father. Excuse me. Kiyoaki-sama, please enjoy. Whenever you come, the girls here get excited. In my eyes you're only a little saliva flowing rascal. Grandmother, I'm already 19 years old. And saliva is no longer dripping from my mouth. Only weak little rascals are able to say this kind of thing. Don't ever be like your father, partying day and night. Spending money that way is a disgrace to our family. Thinking about the sons who died in battle, I don't feel comfortable living together luxuriously with your father. I don't even spend our family pension, it's always put on the altar, serving God. If sons had to die in battle for the riches bestowed on us from the emperor, then we shouldn't use these riches at all. If your uncles are still living, they definitely won't let your father do such disgrace. I understand. I will try even harder. Kiyoaki, why are you so late? I'm sorry. This is my son. This is the younger brother of Thailand's new king. Highness Barta, as well as his younger cousin, highness Chris Sada. They will study abroad here in the royal school. How do you do your highnesses, my name is Kiyoaki. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. That is the most magnificent ring. This is my birth stone, Before I left I got it from Jin. Jin is his fianc?, back in Thailand. Let him see Jin's photo. She's very beautiful. Kiyoaki, I'd love see a photo of your loved one. She is sure to be exquisite. It would be wonderful to meet some truly beautiful Japanese ladies. Ah. What did the princes ask? They said they wanted to see my girlfriend. This child still doesn't have any girlfriend. A big embarrassing, but he's still a kid. Kiyoaki, you must properly entertain the princes. This is the Ayakuras' home. Are you Tadeshina? Ah, it's Matsugaes' young master. Why call so late? I have something to ask you. Yes. I mailed a letter to Satoko-san, but when you receive that letter, do not open it. Burn it immediately. OK... Do you understand? Even though I don't know what's going on, but I will do as you say. Although this can't be a thank-you gift, I want to invite you to see a play. You can bring Satoko-san too. Wow, I haven't seen a play in a long time. Isn't that Satoko-san? Such a coincidence. Let's go there. Good night. Good night. Allow me to introduce my friend, Satoko Ayakura. This is highness Barta, and this is highness Chris. Good night. Good night. Good night, welcome to Japan. Tell me Miss Satoko, what school do you attend? He asked what school you're going to. You help me answer. Satoko is two years older than me, so she is already graduated from high school. I'm envious of your country for having such beautiful ladies. He said he's envious of Japan for having such beautiful ladies. Oh, you over praise. The letter? I've already burned it. Really? Kiyoaki-sama, that letter... I've talked too much. Tadeshina, I will depend on you to help me in the future too. I will await your instructions when necessary. So, is that your sweetheart? She is the most beautiful woman I've seen in Japan. How very lucky you are. You're actually quite seriously in love with her, aren't you? I mean, truly in love. For Satoko, you will be willing...to die. Please take care. I'm Yamada, can I come in? Come in. What do you want? The Ayakuras' daughter said today's snow is very beautiful. She wants to ride and enjoy the snow with you. Snow? Reject her. But she is already at our gate waiting for you. What? Then let's go. What do you want? When I woke up in the morning I saw snow everywhere. Suddenly, I really wanted to walk & enjoy the snow with you. This is the first time I made a selfish request, please forgive me. Did you talk a lot with Honda yesterday? We had a nice chat. What did you talk about? Look, it's so beautiful. Yesterday you introduced me like we were a wedded couple. I'm so happy. Matsugae, can I ask you a question? What? Last time when you told me the story with your father, you said your father took you to a brothel, also the geisha. Ah They were all lies. You made up everything. So what if it's true? Why did you write that letter to Satoko-san? Is it because of me? It shouldn't be me. You've liked Satoko-san for a long time, but you don't want to acknowledge it, because you're too naive. So naive that you cannot admit your own love. In order to draw Satoko-san's attention, you used me. You talk nonsense. I don't want to keep you in the dark. That night, after we left the play and I took Satoko-san home... Honda-san, yes? I know this may be an unusual question, but please understand. OK. This is about Kiyoaki-sama. Does he go to brothels often? Brothels? Does his father take him there often? Excuse me, I've heard him bringing this topic up. Then it's true? Can I ask you a question first? Do you like Kiyoaki? Even if this matter is true, will you still like him? Yes. This incident is not true, including the geisha matters. It's all fabricated? Yes, I see through him whenever he's lying. Then it's not true. Also, Kiyoaki wanted us to be together, but I think he actually loves you. He can only use this method to express his love. So can you forgive him? You should tell Satoko-san your true feelings. Satoko-san has always been waiting for you. That old lady, actually gave the letter to Satoko. So Satoko knew everything. I was deceived by Satoko. Your lady is here. Please can you avoid that topic today? So, your love is a secret? Well, something along those lines. Everyone, I'm glad to welcome you honorable people here. Your highness, we've waited long for you, honor. Our horse got a stroke on the way here. You really love to joke. Hello. So, are you getting used to the Japanese way of life? Yes, quite. Thanks to Kiyoaki's kind assistance, we certainly got along nicely. Looks like you're quite competent. It's been a long time since I've paid respect to you. Ayakura, hello. Oooh, I can't believe you hid such a beauty from me. Is it your first time seeing her? This is the Ayakuras' daughter, Satoko-san. Nice to meet you. It's an honor to be in your highness' favor. I'll help you to introduce. This is the third prince Hanoro Riyou your highness. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Let's immediately start our program. Everyone, please go on the stage. [Film Dialogue] Kiyoaki-sama, we can't do this right here. You're naive, you don't know anything. There are so many carps by the mountainside, more carp means more love in the air. After arriving here, every morning we play Mah Jong. Satoko-san, do you know how to play? No. She's still young at our home, we've never let her play Mah Jong before. Ah, Mah Jong is really fun. Hanoro may not understand affection too much, but don't worry, he has a good heart. His hobby is to collect Western phonograph record, play some to Satoko-san. OK. Today's weather is really nice. Hello, did you tell Kiyoaki-sama please ask him to pick up the phone. I have important news. Satoko-san, I'm really sorry. Kiyoaki-sama said he doesn't want to speak to you. Why? I'm really sorry. Prince Hanoro seems to like Satoko-san very much. Kiyoaki, you better make things clear right now. Do you have any objections to he & Satoko's wedding? Why are you asking me this? What does her wedding have anything to do with me? So you're saying you don't have any objections, right? Yes, I don't care. Really? Good. This is Satoko-san's letter to you. Today, the emperor of Japan grants the prince to marry Satoko Ayakura. Thanks to the emperor's vast graciousness. Satoko? Kiyoaki-sama. If I disappear suddenly, what will you do? Satoko... Satoko... Satoko... Kiyoaki-sama, what brings you here? Let me see Satoko-san again. Things has already came to this, what's the point of seeing her? The wedding has been decided, we must all listen to the emperor now. Even jokes should have limits. This is all caused by you too, it's you who did not keep your promise. It's you that have been lying with open eyes! At first, I thought I was helping both of you by doing that, but I've messed everything up. This is all my fault. But Kiyoaki-sama should think a bit too. When Satoko-san read that letter, she was so sad and frustrated. But when she found out it was a lie, she became so happy. She even calls out your name during her dreams. When the emperor wanted to discuss marriage, Satoko-san continued to wait for you to act and prevent this wedding. She put all her hopes on you. But you did not utter a word. Your request is too much. If your anger is still difficult to dissipate, you can hit me all you want. Right now I can't do anything to fix this. It's too late. Who said it's too late? If I show Satoko's letters to the emperor, do you know the consequences? Kiyoaki-sama... You know what Satoko wrote in her letters. Fine, I'll let you two see each other one more time. Are you a customer? No... Tadeshina didn't say anything to you? I understand. Please follow me. Excuse me. No... Emperor already permitted my wedding, if you do this you will be punished. What ever punishment comes I can endure. Gentle breeze, peaceful day, many things we cannot see now. Someone taught me this song, Everybody struggles to find a Mah Jong master. Put some clothes on before you get a cold. Kiyoaki-sama, you two should say goodbye. We've already agreed. From now on, please forget Satoko-san, please also give me that letter. We've already reached an agreement. Please give us that letter. I can't give you back the letter, I want to continue seeing Satoko. Kiyoaki-sama, how can you do as you please? Do you know the consequences of your actions? This will not only bring shame to myself alone. Tadeshina, it's OK. Before Kiyoaki-sama willingly hands back the letter, I will have to continue seeing him. Miss... If only we announced our love publicly, we wouldn't have to commit such bold acts now. You're too much. So this is how you really feel. People will pass by here, it's not safe. Walk there. If soldiers saw you two meeting dangerously like this, what should we do? Are there other places to go? Please go home for today, Kiyoaki-sama. I have many things to tell you. Well that's rare... what is it? I made love with Satoko Matsugae...Satoko's engagement... was permitted by the emperor! Did you think about the consequences? This is not only yours and Satoko's problem. Even the emperor is involved now. If this is exposed, your future will be ruined. Also Satoko-san's future. This is so beautiful. Honda, did I fall deeply in love? Coming to Kamakura is not for the Thai prince, but for meeting Satoko. I am a mean man. In order to satisfy my need to see Satoko, I threaten to show her love letters to the emperor. Matsugae, you shouldn't do this. I've already burned that love letter, I didn't read it but used it to negotiate. You want to see Satoko-san this much? Yes, I really want to see her. Honda, I beg you, please help me. Today, I talked with the Thai prince about reincarnation. Reincarnation? It's samsara (reincarnation). Even the Buddha is reincarnated from animals. We were talking about what we were going to be reincarnated into in our next lives. We who committed monstrous crimes, won't have a happy next life. But regardless what we become in our next life, I will always find you. Definitely. Miss, are you awake? Miss? Miss, how could this be? Ayakuras' Tadeshina, it's me. When can I see Satoko again? Satoko-sama can't see you again. What? Will Kiyoaki-sama come here? No, he won't show. I have something to ask miss, that's why I brought miss here. Miss, while no one has noticed yet, quickly get rid of the child. This is the only way. You must get rid of it as soon as possible. What are you talking about? Please face reality. If others hear about this, your engagement will be cancelled. You will bring shame to your father. This will also ruin Kiyoaki-sama's future. Right now you have only one choice, If you still worry, find a way to get the Matsugaes to stand behind you. Then you won't be scared. After all, this is caused by their family's young master. No, I will never do this. Miss... Right now I'm saying this for your own good. When it's too late... I will make you take medicine and get rid of this child. If you do such things, I will make public everything. Why are you still like this? Don't tell anyone this child's father, let me be the only one to take the punishments. This way, Kiyoaki-sama will be protected. I can suffer the punishments alone. Miss, you're going overboard. Tadeshina, I will not listen to you again. Matsugae... Matsugae, what's wrong? Matsugae... It seems like Satoko won't see me again. Dry yourself quickly, before you catch a cold. I wish an earthquake would come, so I can go save Satoko quickly. I wish a war would come, this way I can... use all my strength to break this deadlock. Money? Or power? Power and money won't work. Don't forget, from the very beginning you've chosen a path that won't be save by money or power. It's because this is impossible, it makes you even more lost, addicted. Aren't I right. A possibility has turned into an impossible dream. You've already seen the rainbow, what else do you want to be satisfied? I still want something even better... I want a better ending. Father, what happened? Stay here and don't go out. Father, father... Why suicide? Master Ayakura, please look. Tadeshina, what is this? Master, do you remember our promise 8 years ago? Why are you bringing that up now? That was only a joke. What happened is all written in here. Master, everything is finished now. Do you really want to die? I don't know. If you want me to die, whatever you say, I will do. The wedding date is near, you can't even manage your own people? It's just a maidservant's suicide. No need to panic. This problem is more complex than the suicide. I came not because of that. Tadeshina left a letter, it said, Satoko already is... pregnant. With who's child? On the letter it says... is Kiyoaki-san's child. Besides we who are present here, only Satoko knows this. Tadeshina did not tell Kiyoaki. It's really Kiyoaki's child? I've already asked Tadeshina... I don't care what Tadeshina says. What about Satoko? Did you ask her? Yes. She also admitted. Making the emperor's fianc? pregnant is truly something. This is something the weak men nowadays cannot accomplish. Kiyoaki is really worth being his grandfather's grandson. You still have the mood to say this kind of speech? If this continues, the Matsugae family will be ruined. Don't panic, there is only one solution- get rid of the child. Yes, we can only do this. I know a very good doctor in Osaka, if only you guys agree to it. We'll tell the emperor Satoko went there to visit the Yeshu Temple. So her trip won't bring up suspicion. Even when Satoko was little, her aunt (head of Temple) has loved her. So this trip won't seem unnatural. But getting rid of the child is... This is our only choice. My friend is this kind of doctor, I guarantee Satoko won't get hurt. But... We don't have time to keep discussing this. But this is also Ayakura family's problem. This is also Matsugae family's problem. I understand. You all leave. But I hope uncle can promise me one thing, you must not let Kiyoaki-sama know this. I understand. I won't tell him. I have another request, before I leave Tokyo, let me see Kiyoaki-sama one more time. If you let me meet him, then I promise I will never see him again. This I cannot comply. Please... I cannot let you two see each other. Satoko... Uncle, please let us meet... No. Please... Yamada, Satoko-san is leaving. (The New Bridge Station, Tonight at 8) (To Osaka, Car 5) Do you want to drink something warm? Satoko, what happened? Tell me what's going on? Kiyoaki-sama... Where are you going? Satoko, where are you going? Satoko, Satoko... Kiyoaki-sama... Good bye, take care. Satoko... The rapid stream obstructs the rock, one becomes two. No matter how far they're separated, sooner or later they will meet again. This is my favorite poem, a present. Do you know this poem's meaning? The river flows very fast, even if it's blocked by rocks, split into two, one day it will eventually come together again. Even if we encountered adversities, we will reunite again someday. This is the meaning of this poem. I get the written sign, you get the picture sign. Why give it to me? Even if we encountered adversities, we will reunite again someday with these amulets. Then let's hope to reunite someday. Satoko... Why can't you tell me what's wrong? Why can't you tell me at all? This matter does not need your opinion. Satoko and I love each other, Satoko is mine. Yours? Do you have the guts to say it again? What is "yours"? We're unable to separated from each other. You fool. Can you take the consequences? I will be responsible. I will do anything. Anything. She is the highness' fianc?, and you make her pregnant. Pregnant? We've already decided to get rid of the child. It's both the Matsugae's and the Ayakura's decision. Understand? (The matter is already smoothly solved) Welcome. Congratulations. The next time you come here, we will greet you as a highness. The chrysanthemums in the courtyard are really beautiful. The village gardener sends chrysanthemums every year. But he does requests us to teach him the Buddhist doctrine. Satoko, what's wrong? Nothing. Satoko? What are you doing? Mother, This is the only thing that I can do now. I knew things were going to turn out this way. Let me talk to Satoko alone. I hope to become a nun as soon as possible. You really want to be a nun forever? Yes. Only under one condition, you can never see the one you love again. Do you still agree? Yes. If you swear to never see him again, I will go through the ritual immediately. But once you've decided, you cannot go back. I swear I won't see him again. I've already said good bye to him. Most people pity the Ayakuras, but I think this matter has damaged the emperor's dignity. About Satoko-san going crazy, I only found that out afterwards. Why didn't they find that out earlier? I know. Hmm... (Royal Family Cancels Marriage Contract On Own Initiative) What happened? Satoko did not go crazy. In order to protect Matsugae's reputation, my father invented this lie. Then Satoko-san... She became a nun. A nun? I'm planning to see her right now. Matsugae, give up! You two are already impossible. Right now I finally understand what I really want. Before I go see her, I wanted you to know this. I'm very sorry, she can't see you. Is it the head nun's order? No. Then let me see the head nun. I can't do that. Why? Please go home. I won't go home, only if you let me see her. No matter how long you stay, you can't see her. Satoko won't see me? Why? Are you Honda-san? I am. Thank you for coming. He won't let me inform his family members. Please go in. Why injure yourself so much? What are you doing? You can't meet with Satoko-san like this. You're too sick. Come back with me to Tokyo. Matsugae! Today maybe Satoko will see me. I believe she will change her mind. Then I will go. Trust me. I'm your friend. I heard you especially came from Tokyo. Yes. I've once listened to your teachings in the Matsugae family. Really? But Matsugae's young master is really pitiful. Matsugae now has a high fever, no one take care of him. I got phone call from up, went here quickly as possible. Today I came here as represent of Matsugae Matsugae keep saying he should meet Satoko. He doesn't care about sick and pain in his body, I really should take him back to Tokyo quickly to see a doctor. But that's not what in his mind right now. Matsugae will keep searching for something important. I'm his friend, thus I cannot not help him. Please could you let him see Satoko-san just once. Please agree... Please raise your head. Guest, are you sure you're OK? You might think that it is I that persisted and kept them from seen each other. But this matter is not the kind that manpower can obstruct. Because Satoko swore that she won't see Kiyoaki-san again. Therefore the Buddha does not let them meet. Truthfully, I also think Kiyoaki-san is quite pitiful. He cannot see Satoko-san no matter what? Please go back. I suddenly feel so cold. It's snowing. Satoko, is this OK? Yes. Matsugae... Matsugae... Satoko? Where's Satoko? I understand. Let's go home. I just had a dream, We will definitely meet again. Matsugae... Definitely can...unite under the water fall. After the snow melts, spring comes. The distance between us seems to pull closer. The snow that fell on us has already changed into cherry flower's petals. Before the next winter comes, I will accept the abundant falling cherry petals' blessings. I believe we will definitely obtain happiness.
