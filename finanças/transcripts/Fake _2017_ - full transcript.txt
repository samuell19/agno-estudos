72 seconds FAKE : THE MAN WITH A THOUSAND FACES One of Nine Unlocking the door with pin number Almost there... Geun Ho, can I have 50 cents? It was when I was in high school. Your brother is studying, so quiet down. Just go and take out the trash. As an underachieving student, I was always compared to my older brother, who went to a good college. Hey, guys. "Stop it. That's enough." Ever since I was a kid, I was good at impressions. 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100! I'm coming to find you! Starting right now. Where's Geun Bae? Geun Bae is so annoying. Let's stop playing with him. - Geun Bae! - Geun Bae, where are you? Geun Bae's Grandpa. Seriously, what's wrong with your grandson? You're always asking me to kiss you on the cheek. Geun Bae. Oh, Hyung! And then ultimately I eventually tried to fool those closest to me. Even by changing my voice. Mom... Give Geun Bae some allowance. Just give that to Geun Bae. No, not like that. "Just give that to Geun-bae." Give it to Geun Bae. Give it to Geun Bae. I told you not to barge in like that. My goodness I thought I heard Geun Bae. Sorry. Can I get you something to eat, Son? Instead of me, just give some to Geun Bae. Okay sweetie. Sorry to interrupt you. I felt so loved. But it also made me that much angrier. I became more obsessed with disguises. When I became someone else, people respected me more. Kim Jae Hyeong. - Four eyes, go downstairs. and you two, heads on the ground. What's up with you today? From this moment on, we should feel remorse for bullying others and disband. To show your remorse, you are to stay in this position until the end of the lunch hour. What a hypocrite. He's way worse than us. My dear Kim Jae Heong ... Didn't I tell you Stop it! Are you Teacher Im? We spoke on the phone earlier. I'm Detective Geun Ho Kim from the Major Crimes Unit. There have been a lot of calls recently regarding a bullying problem here. I thought it best to discuss it in person. Oh, hello. You came at the perfect time. I'm outta here! - Why you little... - Geun Bae Yes. Hyeong? Let's talk. Not in the mood to talk, huh? She says the same thing every time. "Understand where Mom's coming from" But you shouldn't have ran away from home. Do you know what I've heard her say most often in my life? "A worthless punk." Geun Bae. Geun Bae, you're a capable person. You're very worthwhile. Liar. You're Alpha One. .Remember? I am Alpha One, warrior of justice! Alpha One? What's that? - I don't know either. That's my name now. What kind of name is that? My brother calls me Alpha\ One. Alpha: first. One: number one. You're going to be the best actor in Korea. You'll probably get into the best acting school and be top of your class. I had my application all ready for acting school. Our loving mother ripped it to shreds! Kim Geun Bae! Alpha One! Hyung. Do you really think that I'm worthwhile? I ran away from home after I graduated from high school. I wanted to live my own life. The first time I ran away, I came back a month later. The second time, six months later. The third time, a year later. Then... "Now, this card is all you need." "These days, this credit card is the gold standard." Cut! - Very good. Shall we watch the playback? - Sure. How about we change the angle of your face? - Change the angle? -Yes. - How about the card? - Geun Bae! Hyung. Geun Bae, come see Mom with me. Why do you keep pushing this? You're free this weekend, right? She's coming over to my house this Sunday. Have a drink with me on Saturday and sleep over. Hey, do this once for me. Alright? I never ask you for favors. I'll try to make it, but don't count on it. Mom wants you to forgive her. I gotta get back. I know your address. If you don't come, I'm going to take Mom to your house. Hyung? Hyung! Hyung! What happened? Hyung! Hyung! Get up! Hung! Please wake up! Hyung! Wake up! Hyung! Hang on... -Geun Bae.. -Yes, talk to me. What is this? Hyung! Hyung! Please! I'm calling for help! Stay with me please! Why did your brother have to die? It should have been you! Get out! Get the hell out!! Your brother is studying. Quiet down. Go take out the trash. I thought I heard Geun Bae. You're a capable person. You're very capable. "Just give that to Geun-bae." - Geun Bae. - Yes, Hyung. My brother calls me Alpha One. You're going to be the best actor in Korea. -Enjoy. -Enjoy. Do you mind if I sit down? How is it? Is it good? Thank you. Thanks to you, my son has gotten so much better. You don't have to thank me. It's my pleasure. Can you smile a bit more? Good. 1, 2... With all of your support, we'll be renovating the building. We'll be able to accept more patients. The time of death was 2:47 pm. The world still needs much more of our help. Yes, it does. Civil Servant Identification Kim Geun Ho Geun Bae didn't come? No. I think he still needs some more time. I'm sure he'll call soon. I know he will. Alright. Geun Ho. please find him for me. Our Geun Bae ... My baby... Please find him. I beg you. Yes, Mom. But Geun Bae wanted to go to acting school. He asked me to pay the application fee, but I refused. I was such a terrible mother to him. Geun Ho please find my Geun Bae. Before I die, I want to be forgiven by him. That's all I want. There's nothing else I want. Seoul Metropolitan Police Station. Three of nine Chief of Police Seol Ji Hwan. What's this? Why did you write it in Chinese? A letter of resignation? Why are you giving this to me? Give it to your team leader. Excuse me? Geun Ho, I like your vibe today. You're always such an attention grabber. She's over there. Hang on... I just... -Sit. -Excuse me? I said sit. Okay. I didn't know you could pull off an act like this. How dare you try to fool me? She clearly knows. If not, she wouldn't have brought me to the interrogation room. Starting now I want you to answer with absolute honesty. This is a problem. I thought I had prepared everything completely, but it wasn't enough. Saying the needed a moment to think ... she starts crying out of the blue. I should carefully try to talk to her. "Please don't cry, Noona." would be a good approach. Noona? Isn't she older? She clearly looks older than Geun Ho. Maybe they weren't close. Team Leader Woo Yeong Hui. I'm sorry, Team Leader. Team Leader? What does she want me to do? I can't figure her out. After your younger brother went missing, I know you've been trying harder than anyone to find him. She knows I ran away from home. They must have been close. -And? - I understood when I couldn't reach you for a monthn... - And? -However, you come back in a month and and hand in a letter of resignation? After my brother's death, I decided to live as my brother. On Sunday, I met my mom and resolved my misunderstandings with her. The next day, I decided to fulfill my brother's wishes to live for the benefit of everyone and disguise myself as him. To completely discard my identity, I reported myself missing. The chief gave me a month's leave, so I could go find my brother. And because I know nothing about being a cop, I resigned today. But why is she so angry? She's crying again. Hang on. Did Geun Ho date her? I should comfort her just enough to not offend my brother. It's alright. No matter what, we will endure forever and ever. That's... This resignation never happened. Why did you rip it... -Detective Kim? -Yes? - What's this? - It's a letter of resignation. -Then, what's this? -That too. You wrote two? I actually also wrote a third one just in case. Oh, now he's just asking for it. How about I make it easy for you. Get ready! You're dead! My gosh! Who are you? What do you think this is? A lounge? Move it! What a nut. Live in a condo by a lake. Available now. Enjoy a better life. Brought to you by Saenmul Construction, Inc. Cut! Great, Ms. Choi. Why don't we take a look at the playback? - How was it? - It came out well. This time, let's try it with a little more expression. - Let's keep this and do one more take. - Okay. Let's do another take. I feel so blessed to have met such an amazing actress as you, Sol Choi. Even Director Kim called me and asked where I found such a gem. To make sure he'd do his best I told him we were extended family. In any case, thank you for your hard work today. If you want to thank me, how about getting me a nice bottle of wine? It would be my pleasure. - How do you like the food? - Yes, it's delicious. Today, being a very special day, please bring us a very special bottle of wine. - Right away. - I'll prepare something extra special. Thank you. Choi Sol, how would you feel about continuing to work with me in the future? I would be thankful, Mr. Han. If you're thankful, give me a gift to prove it. But of course. What is this? How did you get in? You changed the pass code. I can't believe you didn't tell me. What are you doing? Sit down. -Yes, ma'am. -Ma'am? I mean...what? Nothing. Honey, are you really going to quit? You know I always go through with whatever I set my mind to. Dummy. You always go back on your word! Am I wrong, Mr. Flip-flop? - No, I don't. -You don't? Then, why did you do that to me? - What did I do? - You keep postponing our wedding date. Did you not? Mr. Flip-flop? Stop. What? You idiot! You just do that when you have nothing to say. I talked to the chief today. Considering your state of mind, we're going to forget your resignation. - What the? You can't do that... - Just hear me out. I changed it into a long-term leave. It's long-term, but it's not indefinite. You can take up to three months. On your break, find Geun Bae and set things right with your mother. You're coming back to work after that, okay? Okay. Lastly, we're getting married before the end of the year, okay? What? You want to marry me or die? What's this? - Marriage or death? - Is that a gun? Alright! Wait! Stop for a second. Stay still. Are you into men now? Please! Marrying you wouldn't be much different from marrying a man. Stop right there. Do you want to die? Freeze! I need you to look into that. I just can't stand to see you lose your edge. Think of it as helping me out on the side. Mr. Han, there are only 30 of them in the entire world. They are a special limited edition. There's only one in Korea. - I know that for sure. - I know that, too. Well then, shouldn't you of all people have it then? You have no idea how ashamed I am because of this. Losing this one feels like I've lost a piece of history. I will find whoever has it and get it back no matter what. - Darth Vader. - Darth Vader. It's the only one I need for my collection. It's really driving me insane! Are you looking for Darth Vader? Oh my God! I think I'm going to cry. Dark Vador, you're right here. I'll give it to you. In return, your company's next commercial campaign features me. Who are you, again? I'm an actress. My name is Sol Choi. It seems like you know me quite well. Well enough to know you've been looking for this. SCANNING... Have a good night, Mr. Kim! - Honey! -You startled me! Are you here to see me? No, I wanted to give you this. You're so unromantic. Don't make me break our engagement. There's an idea. I mean, I came because I wanted to see you to give you this. What is it? It can't be! Is this really the hard drive? You found it already? You think that was fast? Honey, you know how much I respect you as a cop, right? This is amazing! I think this might help us solve this case. Aren't you happy? This means I'll be able to earn more money. High five! What's this? Come on. You're giving me butterflies. I'm going to see what I can get off this. I'll make you ramen with rice cakes later. I'll even add some dumplings! Bye! Hi. Hey, it's you. Do you know who I am? Of course, I do. Who am I? You don't seem to remember. I'm Min Gyeong Eon. What was your name again? Right, Min Gyeong Eon! I'm Kim Geon Ho. Right, you're Min Gyeong Eon. Liar. You're not Kim Geun Ho. Who are you? fExcuse me. I'm sorry. I can't help you. I'm a foreigner. I can't speak Korean. Wait... I can't speak Korean. I'm sorry. I can't help you. Okay. That hurts! You're trespassing. I know everything! I know you're not Detective Kim Geun Ho. Look at this. You're Detective Kim when you leave your house. Then here, after the security officer goes to the bathroom... Wait a second. Look right here. This is you, isn't it? Then, at the corner. Here, you're the truck driver. Man, you're incredible. - Who are you? - What should I be? It all depends on who you are. I'm Kim Geun Ho of the Major Crimes Division, Unit 3. Who are you? You're not Kim Geun Ho. I know him. Please help me out. I promise to bring the money. When? I don't have the money right now, but I'll find the money soon and bring it to you. I'm sorry. It'll be difficult to get a loan, because under the Emergency Financial Assistance System, your mother is not an emergency patient. And she's already used up all her emergency welfare funds. I think it's time for us to give up. You haven't been able to work, and we don't have any money. You can't force what's not meant to be. So then that means you'll die soon. - Have you been eating? - Of course. I eat five meals a day. I want to go home. We don't have a home anymore. This is your home now, Mom. Did you give up the house as well? This place is way better. I can even take showers here. I wish this was our home, right? You knew I wasn't Detective Kim Geun Ho from the beginning. That means you already knew Detective Kim. And you're the only one who knows about my disguises. This unfortunately means you must die. Kill me then. I don't mind. Thief! You're under arrest for the crime of theft. Sir, wait! I have a request. Please give this bread to my mother. She's in room 803 at Gil Hospital. Her name is Jeong Soon Yi. What? My mom wanted to have the bread with peanut butter crumble on top but I don't have any money. I'll pay for this and this. Charge it on this card, please. Here, use this to buy your mother bread and something delicious. I promise to pay you back. Don't steal again. Come see me if things become difficult. Okay? He bought me bread a few more times after that, so we knew each other quite well. But you didn't even recognize me. That's how I knew you weren't him. Fine. Why were you looking for him? Because my mother died. - Enjoy. - Thank you. - Enjoy. - Enjoy. - Enjoy your meal. - Thank you. Compensate me. Revive my food! Revive my mom. Let her live, I said. Revive my mother! Save her, you bastard! Save her! So, you need money for your mother's surgery? Yes. You spent all the deposit on your house. Because I can't let my mother die. You're a good son, Gyeong Eon. Since you're a good son, I'll give it to you straight. You'll do whatever is necessary to keep your mother alive, yes? Is there a way I can do that? I'll give you two big ones. Two big one? Two hundred thousand dollars. Enough for the surgery. As well as As well as enough for a deposit for a new place. What do you want me to do? Just use that vicious strength you showed earlier and kill someone for me. Don't worry, he's a bad person. So there's no need to feel guilty. Remember this. Whatever you use to kill him needs to be taken from his house. - Geun Bae, in the bathroom. My door code is 1234*. If you don't, you're going to jail. I swear it was Detective Kim! The man I killed was Detective Kim! But he came back to life. He wasn't injured and was going to work like nothing happened. I was so relieved! I was so happy Detective Kim was alive! Then, my mother died. Detective Kim lived, but my mother died. That's better though, right? That's better than having the innocent detective die. It's better that my mother died... Mom... But then you didn't recognize me! Detective Kim Geun Ho said he didn't know me! Which means the man I killed that night really was Detective Kim! We have to get those guys. We have to get those men that killed my mother and Detective Kim! Once we get them and I have my revenge, I'll end my life. Whether it's at your hand or mine, I promise to die as well. So please help me. You know the detective was a good man. We should get them together. Let's find them and kill them all! Stop spewing nonsense and get out of my sight. Why? With your skills, I'm sure you can catch them! I am completely worthless, but you're not. You're not worthless like me. I promise I won't get in the way and do whatever I can to help. - Stay out of this. - I don't want to. - I want revenge too. - You'll die before you get it. - I don't care. - You don't care? I don't care if I die. You do whatever I say. Of course. Who are you? Alpha One. Are you okay? Should I take you to the hospital? - Take me home. - No! You're going to die! Police Line. Investigation in Progress. Who filed the first report? It's the woman in the picture. Her name is Choi Sol. She's 27. I think she was his girlfriend. Alright. I'm just going to ask you a few questions. When did you break up with Won Hae Soo, the deceased? About six months ago. Can you tell me why you went to Won Hae Soo's house and how you came to call the police? I got a call from Hae Soo out of the blue the day before. He wanted to meet me the next day. He wanted to get back together, but I refused. At first, he begged, but then he started to get angry. He said he had compromising photos of us together that he would spread all over the internet. I had no choice but to see him. When I did... When you went to see him, you discovered his murdered body. Is that it? Murdered? Yes, unfortunately, there's a high probability that his death wasn't a suicide. I'm just saying that's how things look at the moment. Alright. I think that's enough questions for today. Thank you. Cause of death: asphyxication, poisoning. The thing is, I found something else -that's strange. - Like what? Someone else had paid Won Hae Soo a visit that day. -Who? - Han Seung Wan. - Han Seung Wan? - Yes, the CEO of Saemmul Construction. The same company Choi Sol is the model for. By the way... They suddenly hire a rookie actress as their commercial film actress. Very unusual. And then her ex-boyfriend is found dead in a staged suicide. Something's fishy here. We'll have to wait for the autopsy report, but I bet this will cause a big stir. I almost had it! I'm gonna put the board down here. This is scary to me. -What's the point of throwing this, then? Without stress. - What? Right. Hold it over your head. I don't want to. Wait. Born in July 02, 1970. Kim Tae MIn. His registered address is 37-2 Sujeong-dong, Yangjae-gu, Seoul, His wife is Kim Hye Ji, ID# 781229. Son's name is Kim Hyun Joon, born in 2008. Saemmul Construction. What's up this early, Doctor? Scheduled check up. You didn't know? Kim Ta Min Sleep inducing sedative (VALIUM)... Flumenazil, antidote for valium Sungsil Psychiatric Hospital. Hello, I'm sorry to bother you when you are busy. It won't take long. We received Won Hyun Joon's autopsy report. They found traces of toxic level of a fast acting sedative, but the ultimate cause of death was asphyxiation. This is very strange to me. He was already going to die a fatal level of sedative. So why would the killer decide to strangle him? I checked his phone records from an hour before his time of death. It turned out he talked to just one person. Han Seung Wan. CEO Han Seung Wan? You've been dating him, haven't you? - Yes. - Is that why you broke up with Won Hae Soo? Because of Mr. Han? No, it wasn't that. As I became busier with work, he became more and more obsessed with me. After a number of such incidents, I gradually grew tired of the relationship. That's why. Did Hae Soo know about your dating Mr. Han? He stalked me for a long time. For now, Han Seung Wan is a prime suspect. CEO Won would never do anything like that. He didn't have any reason to either. I'm going to ask that you be strong through this process. We're finished. I should go. You need to get back to your shoot. Thank you. Promise me one thing. If you notice anything strange about Mr. Han, call me right away. Okay. -Hello? -Tae Min. Lower your voice as quietly as possible and turn away from the door. I'll get you out of there. Okay. We don't have time. Tell me everything you know about Han Seung Wan. - How does that sound? - Good. We're all set here. Great. Don't worry. I'll send you a fax of our new company registration. I set up a brand new investment company this time. What were you promising them about interest? Per mortgage, they'll make four thousand dollars. Allowing for the risk of loaning on credit, five thousand. How do you make money offering so much? When it comes to auctioned properties, buying a small apartment won't make you a profit. But if you get a big building, the profits will easily be in the hundreds of thousands. Hundreds of thousands? I was sold by the opportunity sounding like once-in-a-lifetime thing. So I took out every cent of my savings and gave it to him. Tae Min, what do you think about running this company together? -I'll start you off with 500K. -500K? Welcome, President Park. This is Managing Director Kim Tae Min. Han Seung Wan sweet-talked Park Sang Cheon, swindling him the same way he did to me. Then, a few days later... Our company needs to be registered under multiple names. And my name will be listed first on this 50 million-dollar building? That's right, as President. Or, how about as chairman? Managing Director, President, Chairman... If you could just sign here... -To people like us... -We need your signature, too. ...we weren't used to titles like that. However, it wasn't long until... -Get him! -Where is that bastard! - Where is Han Seung Wan? - Where is he? - You're the CEO, Park Sang Cheon, right? - Wait. -I'm also a victim in this. -A victim? You're CEO! You're not a victim. You're an accomplice! - We invested in this too! - We are victims! On paper, Park Sang Cheon and I were perfectly framed for the scam. We were taken in and questioned by the police. Detective... Mr. Park realized that we were finished. It was all wrong. And in the end... Then What about you? I knew Han Seung Wan a lot longer, so I knew his phone number registered under a borrowed name. When I called him, he said he wanted to meet. I was going to call you, old friend. Thanks for reaching out first. My money. Give me back my money. Managing Director Kim. Instead of getting angry, you should take a look at the contract you signed. You said it was a safe investment. What are you doing? That day, they took me somewhere, but I don't remember anything. -You have three minutes, got it? -Yes. Kim Tae Min? Who are you? I'm the one that called you a few days ago. We don't have much time. Do you know Detective Kim Geun Ho? Yes, I do. How do you know him? I'm a detective working on this case. He came to see me one day. He asked me about Han Seung Wan. - Han Seung Wan of Saemmul Construction? -Yes, that piece of trash. I'm gonna get you out of here. Can you walk? No... We have an intruder. Get up! I knew this would happen. I should have killed you earlier. Get up! Get up! We have to take Tae Min with us. No! He has a gun. We might end up dying first. Are you okay? Should I take you to the hospital? - Take me home. -No, you're going die! I'm not going to die, you idiot. That's right! Because you're Alpha One! You met with Mr. Han? Yes. I met him to ask why he went to see Hae Soo on the day he died. What did he say? I really didn't want to tell you this. He threatened to blackmail me. Said he'd ruin your acting career. - And? - I went to see him. - He asked me for money. - For money? 100,000 dollars. - Mr. Han gave Hae Soo 100,000 dollars? - Yes. We can confirm that by tracking Won Hae Soo's account. What else? That was it. He didn't know what happened after that. I'm really scared. Detective, I don't know what to do. If Mr. Han really killed Hae Soo, what am I going to do? He's alive. Alpha One is alive. I thought you said you wanted to see my face. Why didn't you look? I couldn't do that. Idiot... I'm going to go back there. Where? I have to kill that gunman. You're done now. I have to kill him. He's not the one who killed your mother. It's someone else. It's his boss. Who is it? Han Seung Wan. Who the hell are these guys? One of them is someone we know. Really? It's Min Gyeong Eon. He's the one we hired to get rid of Detective Kim Geun Ho. Who? Him? Him? - He's the one on the right. -Do you remember him? I've never seen him before. Find them and bring them to me. Both of them. -What of Detective Kim? -There's nothing unusual. He's been focused on finding his missing brother. You still don't get it. Someone is slowly wrapping their hands around my neck and choking me. But it's not Kim Geun Ho. So then who the hell is it? Who is that bastard?! I'll look into it. Today Choi Sol found Won Hae Soo dead and reported it to the police. But why did I have to find out from her? I'm sorry. I'm beginning to think that Choi Sol is hiding something from me. Perhaps, but Ms. Choi is someone you're very fond of. I never cared for someone as much as her. But if the thing you care about most has a defect .. Then, it needs to be thrown out. Did you say Mr. Han proposed to you? He invited me out to his mansion. Something's not right. I'm planning to just say I can't go. No, no. You should go. Why? Think about it. You have to be sure if Mr. Han was the one who killed Hae Soo or not. Wouldn't that put your mind at ease? Also, if he really is the culprit, refusing his proposal could lead to disastrous consequences. I'll follow you, so you should meet him at his vacation home. Won't that be dangerous? There's nothing to worry about. I'll go alone without reinforcements. Why? Because nothing can go wrong today and we don't know anything yet. If news of this gets out, it could put you in danger. Okay. I understand. Here. Just in case, hide this in your bag. This way I'll always know exactly where you are. I'm in San-491, .Umyeon-san, Gyeonggi Province, Come here quickly. You message has been recorded. What's up with you? Why aren't you answering? It's too long to explain now. Where are you? I'll explain in person. Han Seung Wan invited Choi Sol to his mansion. Something's fishy. - I'm following her. - By yourself? Why. Are you worried about me now? Those men are capable of anything. Wait until I get there. Don't go in on your own, okay? Okay. I left the address in your voicemail. What's he doing? Hello? -Detective Woo? - Be quiet. - Detective Woo, answer me. - He is coming to me. - What is he doing? -Hello? Detective Woo? Answer me! Woo Yeong Hui? Woo Yeong Hui! Did I make a wrong turn? Woo Yeong Hui! Stop screaming! Listen carefully. Wait until I get there. Don't go in on your own, okay? Is something wrong today? Why are you overreacting? Promise me you won't move on your own! Okay. Okay. Detective Woo! Detective Woo! Why would he be looking for Kim Tae Min? Only the one who knows of the existence of Kim Tae Min. It is only Kim Geun Ho. No one else. Could Min Gyeon Eon and Kim Geun Ho be working together? But Kim Geun Ho is currently on a leave of absence to find his brother. And who was that nurse he escaped with from the hospital? What is the name of the detective on Won Hae Soo's case? Woo Yeong Hui. She's the same detective who went to talk to Choi Sol, right? Yes. For now, if I keep my eyes on Choi Sol, I will get to know what is going on. The more I think about it, I'm really, really smart. How did I come up with this? Take Kim Geun Ho's gun, and use it to shoot Detective Woo. I'm really amazing! You chose to be stubborn. Since you refuse to speak, I need to get rid of you. Get rid of him. Let's go. Ta-da! Turns out your gift was a fake. Fake. But the more important thing is, why would I pretend not to know? What is this one? This one is real. Real. I wanted to make you like this. From something fake to something real. Fake to real. I don't know why you're doing this to me. Detective Woo is here. What? Detective Woo Yeong Hui came all the way to my home. Together with you. I don't know what you are talking about. She came to me a couple times asking questions about Hae-soo. That's all I know! Well then, how did she suddenly appear at my doorstep? She must have followed me! How could I possibly believe that? Please believe me. You look hungry. What? Let's have some dinner. - Hello? - Detective Woo! Why don't you stop wandering around outside and come on in. Welcome. Pleasure to meet you. I am Han Seung Wan. How charming. You made it just in time. Dinner is ready. We don't have any business dining together. Why not? Please sit. - Stop right there. - Do sit down. What are you trying to pull? Put your gun down and eat first. Get up! You haven't had dinner, have you? Mr. Han did say you might join us, and you really came. What is the meaning of this? What do you mean? Have a seat. Alright. Let's eat first. Let's eat. Before it gets cold. I didn't know what you like, so I prepared Korean and Western cuisine. I hope there's something here you'll like. Sol, is everything really okay? I'm fine. I don't understand why you're being like this. But, isn't it a bit odd for the person wielding a gun to be asking if things are okay? Let me ask you something. What have I done wrong? You really don't know? - I truly do not. - Won Hae Soo. You killed him. You are mistaken. I wasn't expecting a flat out confession. Unbelievable. No way. Well, anything else, Detective? Are there any other crimes you'd like to accuse me of? That must mean there are more. Okay. We're done here. Who the hell are you? Are you okay? Have you seen Detective Woo? You're saying you really don't know how she got here? I really don't know. Please believe me. There's no way she just found us here. I told you that she could have been following me. I'm not sure but... I don't think so. There. Let's wrap this up. His last bullet is for us. Detective Woo! Yeong Hui? Detective Woo! Detective Woo, wake up! Yeong Hui! Yeong Hui, get up! Yeong Hui! Yeong Hui! Please get up, Yeong Hui! If you stay here, they'll frame you for all this. They shot her with Detective Geun Ho's gun! There's no time. - Let's go! We have to get out of here quickly! - Detective Woo! - Let's go! - Yeong Hui! Woo Yeong Hui! Woo Yeong Hui! A police officer's body was discovered in the woods of Yangpyeong. The victim was Detective Woo Yeong Hui of the Metropolitan Police Dept. A colleague of hers, Detective Kim Geun Ho is currently the prime suspect. The news has shocked many. My vacation home is right up that road. Han Seong Whan: witness When I took my dog for our morning walk, he kept barking at something. Police are investigating Detective Kim's whereabouts, It's unknown why Detective Woo was there. as he is currently missing. Detective Kim is currently on the wanted list. Detective Kim went on a leave of absence Two were in love. Detective Kim murdered her who was his girl friend and colleague. and based on reports from fellow detectives, police have determined that the two were dating ... Tomorrow is the funeral procession. Shouldn't you go today? Mr. Han. I didn't expect to see you here. She died near my vacation home. I felt it only right to pay my respects. I meant to ask you why do you think Detectives Woo and Kim were in your area in the first place? I have no idea. That little... Another famous actress and businessman couple is born. Businessman Han and Actress Choi are getting married. They are none other than actress Choi Sol and construction mogul Han Seung Wan. The two have yet to make a public statement on the news. There has been much public interest in the announcement of their marriage. You know Princess Leia, right? Leia? Don't tell me you don't know who that is. Have you not ever seen Star Wars? No, I haven't. To be honest, I don't even know what the movie is about. We'll have to postpone our marriage. We'll get married once you watch the entire series. Okay. I'll start watching them tonight. Woo Yeong Hui. Welcome home, sir. Alright, so what you're saying is nothing was taken except for a toy. It's a figurine. Alright. No need to get upset. Pigure? It's a FIGure. A figure... It shouldn't be hard to find. I beg you. It's one of my most precious possessions. Sure. Jeonga Restaurant Damnit! Kim Tae Min! Jeonga Restaurant. What the hell are you doing? It's been a while, hasn't it? Remember this place? Of course, I do. I was a regular here. We used to drink a lot of rice soup here, didn't we? When we used to swindle people. Give it to me. You should try some. It tastes exactly as I remember. Stuff it yourself. Acting like this will make the owner upset. Owner Park, you remember Mr. Han, don't you? Why of course I do. How could I ever forget? You shouldn't waste food like that. Han Seung Wan. Do you sleep well at night? My, my. Who do we have here? My favorite real estate agent, Mr. Han! What the hell is this? Do you have no respect for your elders? You're under arrest for interference with a business and assault. What? I'm the one who was attacked! - Detective Woo? - Are you alright, sir? - Take care now. - Are you leaving? You were behind all this. If you put it that way, I sound like the bad guy. Murderer. Is it safe to be out like this? You're wanted for murder. You killed her, then framed me for it, and now you're looking out for me? - I didn't kill her. - Is that right? What about President Park Sang Cheon? It wasn't enough that you robbed him of his life savings. You also framed him for your crimes and drove him to end his own life without a hint of remorse. But who knows? You could have killed him and made it look like a suicide, just like Won Hae Soo. What is this? You looking for a confession? I must be close or you wouldn't send a hitman to kill me. - Do you have evidence? - No, I don't. However, I have someone who is willing to testify. Now you're gonna talk about Detective Woo, aren't you? You kidnapped two people, locked them in your basement, and planned to kill them both. But in the end only one died. Stop talking nonsense. This is exactly why I had to kill you. You're like a cockroach. No matter what I do to get rid of you, you always manage to stay alive. Why are you such a pest? Really isn't going to be easy. Not easy at all. Detective Woo was also a pest. I promise you, that night in my basement, she left to a quiet, beautiful final resting place. How? Don't hit him! Don't. Turn yourself in. Where are you? Get over here now! Over there! Hey! Mr. Han! That bastard. You´re dead! You guys are finished. I would suggest hanging up, turning on the news, and making a run for it. Breaking news. Detective Geun-ho Kim, the main suspect for Detective Young-hee Woo's murder, submitted video evidence clearing him of all charges. The video shows Saemmul Construction's CEO Han Seung Wan... This is exactly why I tried to kill you. Detective Woo was also a pest. She left to a quiet, beautiful final resting place. Police determined this confession was not given under coercion. Get the car! - Excuse me? - We have to run. Get the car now. Listen carefully. Wait until I get there. Don't go in on your own, okay? Okay. Okay. One month before Kim Geun Ho's death. - There's not much steak left. - This is so good. Yum! I said there's not much left. Seriously! How are they? They look happy. They're dating, right? I think they're still testing the waters. They're just like us. Our relationship is one-sided. - Is that a problem? - Kinda. They're leaving. What are you doing? We're here to work. Don't forget I'm still your superior. What are they doing? She's crying. - I have to go. - Sol. - I don't care. I just... - I slept with him. It's okay. You're pathetic. This all feels so predictable. I agree. An aspiring actress approaches a CEO of a major corporation to launch her career. Then, she breaks up with her ex boyfriend. It's nothing new. Which is why we need to be suspicious. Of who? Han Seung Wan? Choi Sol. Did you find out? Okay. I'll be right there. Hello? Where are you? I found Kim Tae Min's location. Really? Where is he? A psychiatric hospital. A psychiatric hospital. It's not far, so I'll stop by on my way soon. Really? Okay, I'll shop for my wedding dress alone. Yes! Then, I will get any dress I want! Please, just nothing too revealing. Get one that at least covers your neck, shoulders, and back. Why are you trying to keep me so covered up? You don't know? Because you're so muscular. Wedding dresses and muscles don't go together. What then? You want me to get married in a track suit? Can't we just forgo the ceremony? These days, all you need is a marriage license... Hello? Hello? Well I tried. Is there a patient named Tae-min Kim here? One moment. There's no one here by that name. There's no name on this door. That's correct. - Do you mind if I go inside? -Not a chance. Okay. Sorry to bother you. I can't take this. He is getting too closed. Right? It does seem like... We can't stand him any longer, right? Shall I take care of it? No. Let's not get our hands dirty. Find another way. Yes, sir. Kill someone for me. He's a bad person. So there's no need to feel guilty. Where are you? - I want a wedding. - What? When this is all over, I said I want a wedding. Fine. Just don't go in until I get there. Okay, you made a promise. Detective Woo. Detective Woo. Detective Woo, wake up! Yeong Hui! Woo Yeong Hui. It could be very dangerous. Are you okay with that? Yes. We'll prioritize your safety above all else, so don't worry. Make sure to act like your normal self and remember to keep the earring microphone on at all times. What's that? The key to my secret safe in Hong Kong. The value of this key? 300 million dollars. 300 billion won. Where are we going now? China. From there, we'll head to Hong Kong. Does that mean we're... We're going to Incheon, ma'am. They're going to Incheon. Hurry and call our guys in Incheon. Yes, sir. What a dinky little thing. When go from China to Hong Kong, we'll take the biggest yacht I can find. I don't mind. I promise I will give you the most luxurious life. What was that? The boat captain... Han Seung Wan, it's all over now. Drop your gun and come down. Who set me up? Who the hell did this! It was me. What? What are you talking about? It was all me. Han Seung Wan, I told you to drop your weapon, bastard! Please... Please. How could you?! Why?! Why?! Where did you say Detective Woo's files are? You went to the deceased's house and called the police. Can you explain what happened? I got a call from Hae-soo the day before. He threatened to spread photos of us on the internet. - I had no choice but to go see him. - When you got there, you found Won Hae Soo's murdered body. Is that it? He was murdered? It's clear he was strangled by someone. The autopsy report shows no special sign of a struggle or assault. Are you alright? Yes. Right there. Zoom in right there. What is that? Is that coffee? Have you seen any disposable coffee cups? I'll be able to find out which one of them is lying or whether they're both lying after whatever happens in this house today. If something happens to me... Mr. Han did say you might join us. This last bullet is for us. You should just remain unconscious. That way, you won't feel any pain. You were right. About what? You weren't the one who killed Won Hae Soo. You´re too late! Even if you believe me now, I can't let you live. Don't you want to know who the real killer is? No. I'm not curious. Liar. Believe me now? That I was never working with this woman? Detective Woo. Wake up, Detective Woo! Young Hui! Woo Yeong Hui! -Yeong Hui, wake up ! - We have to go. Don't you want to know who the real killer is? - I'm not curious. - Liar. Who set me up. Who the hell did this! It was me. What?! - Sol... - I was never Choi Sol. My real name is Park Hyeon Joo. Daughter of the late Park Sang Cheon. What?! Why are you telling me this now?! Please... My father who used to beg you to return the money you stole took his own life. You... -You! - I killed Won Hae Soo. And as you witnessed, I killed Detective Woo. You're finished. I won. How could you... Why?! Why?! You didn't go through all this to avenge your father. You did it for this. We already have Seung-wan Han in custody. What else is there to do? No, we're not done yet. The key to my secret place in Hong Kong. We'll head to Hong Kong from there. I promise I will give you the most luxurious life. Why?! Thank you to our Undecover Channel Manager: eun_soo_lee_2 Alpha One! Are you alright? Were you hurt? No. I'm fine. What a relief. Wait, how do I know you're not Han Seung Wan right now? You really are Alpha ONE. Right? Yep, it's you.
