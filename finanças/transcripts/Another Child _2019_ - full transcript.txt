Let's work hard! Let's work hard tomorrow, too! Good job today. Special thanks to Director Park for joining us! Mr. Park! Mr. Park! The future's so bright! - Let's go get some more drinks. - What? Go to the right and you'll arrive right away. Do you see 'DEOKHYANG DUCK' restaurant? Wait, I see you. - He has arrived. - Thank you so much for today. We had so many people. No problem. I hope the food was okay. Everyone loved it. - Thank you. - Where's the boss? The driver's here. Let's go in. - Get home safe, sir! - You guys had enough drinks? - Are you not joining us? - What? More drinks? I'll see you tomorrow, sir. Good night. - See you. - Good night. You didn't order more. Almost everyone's gone. Are you okay? What's with her? Do you know her? (DEOKHYANG DUCK RESTAURANT) This hers? What's wrong? Did you two fight? (ANOTHER CHILD) What's for lunch today? Curry! Curry? Hyun-joo. Strawberry or chocolate? Do you have yesterday's math notes? Where'd you disappear to yesterday? Home! Really? You skipped class and went home? You going to lend me your notes or what? Have you given up on life these days? Ugh... whatever. Give them back before you go home. I need it too. What was that? I didn't have breakfast. I'll get them back to you. Joo-ri! Someone asked me to give this to you. - Who? - I don't know. I'm going to eat! - Are you going to eat? - You go ahead. - I'm so hungry. - Hurry up. Guys, don't be pigs. Can you say hello? - Hello. - Hello. (STUDENTS CAUGHT BEYOND THIS POINT) (WILL BE PUNISHED FOR SMOKING) You called for me? What? You're just like your dad. A big coward. What? Hey, your mom seduced my dad. And they're having an affair, you see that right? How can I not? Her belly's growing. Her belly... She's pregnant? How many months? Don't snoop around other's houses, pervert. I wouldn't if your mom wasn't such a gold digger. What? My dad's not rich. Go tell your mom that so she'll stop. It's a warning. If they still see each other, I won't let it. - What're you going to do then? - What? If they keep seeing each other, what're you going to do? Is that my phone? Your husband's cheating on you with my mom, and now she's pregnant... Is it yours? Take it. What'd you just do! You asked me to stop them. Are you an idiot? Why are you making things worse? Idiot? Tell your mom to stop this, then we could've solved it without my mom knowing. And does it change the fact that it happened? What good comes from spreading rumors? What your mom did was adultery. I'll do you a favor and act like the whole thing never happened. What the heck is your problem? You idiot! Why are you so upset? Like you said, just act like it never happened. What? You bastard. (MOM) Jeez... - My math notes. - Here. They're not there. - I guess left them in class. - What? I got busy and forgot. Next week is the national AP exam. What're you going to do? And what about me? Will you stop nagging me? You're not my mom. How is this nagging? Joo-ri Kwon! This variable's value is unknown, and we need to calculate it, right? (How late in pregnancy) (can you have an abortion?) That crazy... Go ahead and eat. I got to go back. I haven't finished. I might be late. Of course, I ate. It's a company dinner. I'm the team leader. I can't leave early. Here we go again! Damn... There's no smoking in here. She'll go outside. Hello? H... - Shit... - The total's $32. Yoon-ah Kim. You're underage, right? It's illegal for you to work this late. That's a big problem. If I report you, you'd... Who are you staring at? I can tell you're underage just by looking at you. That woman isn't your wife, is she? Do you know me? I can tell by looking at you. There's CCTV in here. It's connected to the police station. It's $32. Do you have a discount card? Let's go. - Why? - Hurry up. Come on. - What'd she say? - Just hurry, will ya? Hey! Free of charge. - Why did you pick that up? - Let's go. Come on. Hey, sweetie. Coming from school? Yeah. Joo-ri, did you eat? Studying way too much. Hey. So you haven't had dinner? -Where's Mom? -At church. -Did you see her? -No. She texted. When is she coming? Don't know. Give her a call. Did your company have a dinner yesterday? Yeah. What's all that? Which do you like better? Are you getting a new car? No. They send these to the company to motivate sales. They send these to the company to motivate sales. Why? They think you're rich? Are you popular? Oh, yeah. Sure. Ow! What'd you do that for? - Did it hurt? - Of course, it hurt. - Really? - Yeah, you shocked my muscles. Where? Lay down. Why'd you hit me like that? Feels like I pulled something. - Here? - A little higher. - Here? - Yeah. You've gained weight. You need to work out. Tell your mom that. Mom didn't gain weight. She's still pretty. - How are your studies? - Okay. Shall I get you a new pair of shoes? - Why? - What do you mean why? Because you like shoes. Do you even know what kind of shoes I wear? NEW BALANCE. Size 225. That was my shoe size in middle school. Really? Joo-ri, did you go to your after school program? Yeah. - Hungry? - I ate. Get changed and go to bed. Don't oversleep tomorrow. Okay. Did you drink? Our house price has gone up again. Buying this one was a good idea. You have a good sense for that. - You're going to drink that? - Yeah. Joo-ri's grown a lot, right? She's all grown up. A lady now. - But still a baby inside. - True. You're going to sleep in that room? Yeah. Why? You've been sleeping in there for two years now. I'm used to sleeping alone now. And you're too, right? Good night. Why are you home so late? You're not still doing that part time job, are you? You never listen. I told you to quit because it's unsafe late at night. Alright. - Then get rid of the baby. - What? I'll listen to you if you listen to me. I'll listen to you if you listen to me. Get rid of it. Don't grow up to be like her. Don't you cook ever? I bought sandwiches. Why don't you cook at home? I had morning sickness all day because of the smell at the restaurant. Aren't you embarrassed? Do you know what people say about you? What's it to them? It's my life. Can you make the guy get a divorce? He won't, will he? Yoon-ah, it's a boy. I'm covered. Call him. - What for? - Ask him what he's going to do. What? He told you not to call when he's with his family? It's not like that. He's not that kind of person at all. Daddy's very busy, so mommy can't just call him for nothing, alright? "Daddy"? That guy is someone else's dad. Hey! Don't you have any compassion for your mother? As a woman, I've had the worst luck. Gave birth to you at 17, and had to pay off your dad's debt. Raised you alone. I've had no life of my own. Do you know that? You're my daughter! Why can't you understand me? (LAST LOVE) The person you're calling is not available... (The whole world knows about your adultery) Oh... Where are you going? - Why? - You're not going to eat? - I have a lot to do at work. - What? - Joo-ri, breakfast is ready. - I don't have time. Then eat on the way. I made rice balls. Dad! Dad! Dad! Mom knows... - Joo-ri! - Mom... I... Eat on the way. Yeah... Joo-ri. What? Don't let it get cold. (DEOKHYANG DUCK RESTAURANT) (The whole world knows about your adultery) (DELETE) Ah... shit... - What? - We're having guests from HQ. - Where should we go? - How many are there? Four. Should we go to the same duck place again? What's with the laugh? Huh? Nothing... never mind... Pick somewhere nearby. Okay. You have reached your destination. Welcome. Just you? Menus for one are below here. Are you waiting for someone? I can come back. What're you best at? Excuse me? I'll have the marinated duck. That's for two people. - If you're alone... - Just bring it. And to drink? Nothing. Payment is upfront. Many people leave without paying because a woman runs this place. Some people say they will pay later. So many weird people in the world, right? Thank you. - One marinated duck! - Okay. - It's so cold today. - Hello, welcome. I'm starving. Bring out some food. Your lunch break is early today. - Two lunch sets! - Okay. Hello. Where are you? Yeah, I can talk. It's alright... yeah? Here. Are you at the office? No, not busy... Uh-huh. Are you coming today? Can't you come? I'm not feeling so great. I want to go to see a doctor. Yesterday? No, I never called. Why would I text you at that hour? What did it say? Really? Ma'am! Ma'am, are you okay? You paid but didn't get the food. Oh... you've lost your appetite. You made the right decision then. If it's not right, it's better to stop. I've been running this place three years. I can tell just by looking. There are no good men left, right? Come have some tea. It's dangerous to drive in your state. What the heck's your problem? Congratulations. Because of you, my home is now Hell. How is that my fault? Hey! Hit me, then let's never see each other again. How? We have two more years left in this place. You're going to transfer? We just won't cross each other's paths. Ding. Time's up. I'm going to keep out of it. Stop bothering me. Sit down. You broke the reinforced glass. Even a guy like me would seriously get hurt if he hit it with his fist. So why'd you do it? What's the problem? You two came from different middle schools and different neighborhoods. You don't have any classes together, so it's not that. I need to know what's going on to help you guys out. Well? Joo-ri? Can you tell me? Yoon-ah, you can go. Bring your mom to school tomorrow. If she doesn't come this time, you're suspended. - Got it? - Yes, sir. Now, let's talk. Was she trying to take money from you? No. It's okay. I've heard stories about her. How do you know her? Are you guys close? Look, you have to pick your friends carefully. You don't want to ruin your life. High school records are very important. Making friends with the wrong people, a straight-A student like you... I hit her first. You did? And you shouldn't say things behind people's backs. You should say it in front of them. Hello... yes. Who is this? I'm having regrets about being a teacher. What did I ever do to you to be treated like this? What did I ever do to you to be treated like this? What do you want? Your mom's in the hospital. - What? - What? With my mom. They fought? Just so you know. You should go. Should I go too? (EMERGENCY ROOM) Being pushed over doesn't cause this. So there must've been warning signs beforehand. Tightness in the belly, baby drooping down, blood smears. When those things happened, she should've come straight to the hospital. Her age is a factor too, so we need to monitor her for a few days. Where's the baby? In the incubator. - Are you staying at the hospital? - Yes. What about relatives? What will you do about the academy? I'll still go. Did you two eat anything? Stop frowning. You guys look like you're dying. - Joo-ri, you got the card? - Yeah. Go get dinner. No junk food. Make it something expensive too. It's your dad's money. Where are you going? Where else would I go? Don't you two fight. What's the point? (DEOKHYANG DUCK RESTAURANT) Go on. Mi-hee Kim's family? Here he is. He's undergoing treatment, so be quiet and just look. (MI-HEE KIM'S BABY) Was it this big? It was this big. So small. It was born too early. I prayed for it to die. I wanted to punch my mom in the belly. But it was born after all. Little brother. Do you have a brother? I don't need one. Me neither. The second floor. Okay? (BABY GIRL JOO-RI) (In a meeting. I'll call you later) Dad? Dad! What's wrong? Dad! That guy? Dad! Dad! Dad! -He's not here? -No. There he is! Dad! Dad! Dad! What the... Dad! Mom, Dad ran away. Dad... Dad... Who are you? He ran away. Are you okay? Are you asleep? Eat, eat. I told you so. Serves you right. Why are you so jumpy? Were you asleep? I'm just laying here. I have a headache. I'm going out for a while. - Where? - The salon. - At this hour? - I called the owner. What? Should I stay? No, but... don't be long. Why? What if Dad comes home? Are you scared of him? No. - Joo-ri? - Yeah. Do you want spicy rice cakes? No, I'm okay. The IV is finished. - Oh, Room 8. -Yes. You're Mi-hee Kim's daughter, right? Yes. Here. Your aunt forgot this. - My aunt? - She said she's your aunt. She paid when your mom was moved to a room. She paid when your mom was moved to a room. ($512.00 / Paid by Young-joo Ahn) Your transaction is being processed. (TRANSACTION FAILED: INSUFFICIENT FUNDS) Please take your card. Your transaction is being processed. (INSUFFICIENT FUNDS) Please take your card. (DAD) Mom... did Dad come home last night? No. I packed your breakfast. Eat it on the way. Hey! Where are you coming from? Are you staying at the sauna? Yeah. For a few days. Do you have change? I want coffee. Hurry up. Not too cold anymore. Winter's almost gone, right? What about your car, Dad? Huh? You sold your car too? Why'd you call me? What'd you come here for? Your mom ask you to? No, why? - What's up with her? - Why? I don't know. She keeps asking for money. - You don't have money? - No, I don't. Mom doesn't either. She has her restaurant. Don't be ridiculous. She can't even make rent. You really don't have money? Man, you're getting more and more like your mom, huh? Especially when you don't believe what I tell you. If you don't have money, you can't do that. I'm just watching. Sometimes, if I feel lucky, I play a round, and if the luck's there, I play another. And if I hit the jackpot, I hit the jackpot. Can't you get a job? Mom's not doing well. A little time, just a little. Anyway, you're all grown up now, right? How old are you this year? Over eighteen? You got your ID with you? Apply for a credit card for me before you go. Won't take long. I'm only fifteen, so I can't do that. I can't get cash loans either. Oh, really? You're not eighteen yet? Hey, what's written on that car? - You can't see it? - My eyes are bad. - Hurry up! - It says "Sabuk Sauna". - I got to go! - The shuttle to the casino! You're leaving too, right? - I'll call you! - Hurry up! To casino! Dad! Do you even know my name? What? What's my name? Hold on. If I miss this, I'll have to take a taxi! I got to go! Let's never see each other again! Yoon-ah! I'm sorry! Stop... Sit down. The person you're calling is not available... (In a meeting. I'll call you later) Young-joo...Honey... I spent the night in the parking lot. Do you want to go somewhere? Do you remember my friend who runs a pension on the west coast. Are you listening? I'm on my knees now. Please forgive me. Remember when our company was having difficulties. Remember when our company was having difficulties. I worked several nights straight and didn't come home. Our team had a retreat, - and we went to a duck place... - What're you doing? I thought you were in there. The door's locked. Did you get a haircut? I locked it so you can't go in. All our valuables are in that room. Young-joo... I'm sorry. Please forgive me this once. When our company was in trouble and I couldn't come home for days... We had a team retreat and dinner at a duck restaurant, and I got too drunk... Your cellphone password is Joo-ri's birthday, right? So you entered your daughter's birth date and called her? You saw it? Honey, just give me one more chance. You and Joo-ri are all I have. Let's all go on a vacation together. Do you remember my friend who runs a pension on the west coast. You can go with Joo-ri. Just the two of you. Okay? I'll straighten everything out while you're away. Now? You're going to straighten what now? Yes... I'll straighten... Was it lust or love? Answer me. Lust or love? - I'm sorry. - Both? Young-joo, I'm sorry. It must've been love. Isn't that why she had your baby? That was an accident. Has she asked for money now? She's not that kind of woman. Then what are you! I'm sorry, honey. You are a liar. You deceived two... no, four people! Honey... Just listen to me. Do you really want to end things like this? Don't come in! And I've put the apartment up for sale. Young-joo... (CONGRATS! Joo-ri's First Birthday) (Registered owner of the house: Dae-won Kwon) Dae-won Kwon... Dae-won Kwon... (ACCOUNT HOLDER: DAE-WON KWON) Dae-won Kwon... What a dumb.. - Eat this. This. - I'm fine. - Hello. - Hi. You're not running away, are you? No. Cheer up, okay? Thank you. I can't pass this on. It might rouse suspicion. She's not home. Can't you call her? She told me to leave it with you, really. What's your relation to her? She's my aunt. There she is. Give it to her yourself. Ma'am! Hey, kid. Here. We have more. Thank you. Are you her daughter? No. Relative? If you're not her daughter or relative, then... I want one too. Hmm... delicious. Is it a new kind? Show me. I won't take it from you. Drink this. Mom wanted me to give this to you. - Your name's Yoon-ah, right? - Yes. - You were the one on the phone? - Yes. Did you tell Joo-ri too? She already knew. How did she know? I don't know. She must have seen them together. Do you hate your mother? Why would you ask me that? Thank you for taking my mom to the hospital. Yoon-ah, be strong right now. It's a very important time in your life. Ma'am, you should worry about your daughter. Thank you. Sorry. I can be a little blunt just like my mom. It's not because of you. You didn't do anything wrong. It's okay. You can go. The thing is, I'm $50 short. I skipped a few shifts this month, so I didn't have enough. But I'll give the rest to Joo-ri next week. I can't live with debt. So don't forget to ask Joo-ri if she got money from me. Okay, I'll ask her. (BIRTH DECLARATION) (REQUIRED DOCUMENTS:) (DECLARER'S ID, ORIGINAL BIRTH CERTIFICATE) Come on. Let's go. - It isn't right. - Mom... You don't eat right. You sleep all day. When you do wake up, you only eat snacks. You should get plenty of nutrition to breastfeed. If you can't do the most basic thing, why'd you have a child? How worrisome! Just a big problem. - Why are you talking down to me? - What? I don't know you. Don't talk down to me. Why are you talking like that to me! Cause you started it. How old are you? Huh?! How many years have you lived? Ridiculous! I'm concerned for you! What kind of response is that? - Let it go! Never mind her! - What? - This woman's ridiculous! - What? Who asked you to worry about me? What business is it to you? - Huh? She's nuts, totally nuts! - Stop it. Don't shout in here. Return to your rooms. - How ridiculous! That woman! - Ah, Mom! You're not my kid's friend, are you? She's not exactly friendly. She takes after me. I don't have friends either. I'll make them when I'm in college. Why are you smiling? What? You don't like how I smile either? What're you doing here? I'm here to catch my dad. Take this. What is it? Give it to the nurse and ask her to give you a birth certificate. - Why? - You file a birth declaration. For that, you need a birth certificate. I'm underage, so they won't give it to me. What're you doing? Taking a nap. Sleeping through all day? You haven't seen the baby yet, have you? What kind of mother are you? Don't come to the hospital anymore. Huh? You're causing more pain. I got it. Just let me get the birth certificate. Go back to school! I'm not an excuse to cut class! Got it? Keep it down! I can't make this easy if you keep making it hard. Why are you getting mad? What did you do so right? Did he grow since last time? He looks like a person now. Pretty. He won't open his eyes. Is he sleeping? Newborns are like that. When will they remove the stuff stuck to his body? Did he just smile? That was a smile? He smiled. When you smile, you get uglier. It's not easy to live in this world. Are you ready for that? Hey. Hang in there. (DONG-WOO PENSION FOR RENT) You closed the pension business? I got nowhere to go. You told me to come over anytime... - It's damn slippery. - Shut up and just drive. I came here alone. I need some time to think things over. Okay, then. Have you come for fishing? No. Is that your car? Yeah, why? What? I can't ask a question? Where are you from? Judging from the car, it's not from around here. Seoul? Are you here alone? Have you come to meet someone? How'd you know about this place? We're small. Why? What do you want? Pay me a parking fee. You come to my neighborhood. It's a great view. We got the ocean. And it's all for free. So pay me a parking fee. What parking? There's no parking lot. What did you say? You can't just park your car at someone's front door. You can't just park your car at someone's front door. Do you know how much trouble our people went through to build this place? - It's made in Korea. - That's a Grandeur. Hey! What're you doing? Don't change the subject! Give me the fee! The view is too great! If you sit here, time flies by... - How much do you want? - Give me 10 bucks. I usually take 20 from others. Hey! Stop it! What the heck? Let's get that idiot. Hey... want fishing? Need fishing rod? Get out of my turf, bastard! If you do, it's $10 more. - Hey! - Yay! - Awesome! Love you! - Who wants rice wine?! Why weren't you at school today? I'm dropping out. What? I got to raise the kid, so I'll work and be independent. How are you going to raise a kid? I'm more qualified than my mom or your dad. - And money? - I'll get a job. My mom had me in high school. Careful of the cuts. Time for my private class. You might be able to quit, but I've got a mountain of studies to do. Alright. See ya. Hey. How can a high school dropout raise a kid? The world's not that easy. If you do this, you'll... Then what do I do? Throw him away? Put him up for adoption. He'll get a better education. Think about his future. Hey! I'm his sister. Why put him up for an adoption? Even if he doesn't have a mom and dad, he has me. I can take care of him. Do whatever you want. Let's not see each other again. Yeah. Take care of your mom. What? Take care of your mom. You take care of your mom. In the name of the Father, the Son, and Holy Spirit, amen. It's been six months since my last confession. I hurt a person. It wasn't on purpose, but I pushed a pregnant woman and she gave birth prematurely. The hospital says it was caused by something else, but I still feel guilty. The child is a result... of my husband and the woman's adultery. I cannot... forgive this situation. My daughter is a high school student, and she knows everything. I am so tired. Those people caused all this. And I wish they were really bad people. I wish the child was sick, as God's punishment to them. Mom, where are you? Can I skip after school program and come home? I want to see you. I want to come home and eat with you. He needs a best of luck tonight. That caused his heart damaged as well... There's counseling available. You can talk to the nurse about it. You'll get through this. What about the mother? Okay, please take good care of her. (BIRTH DECLARATION) Where are you? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. I called the doctor. I should've been there. I'll check out tomorrow. They say you're okay? Yeah. Where are you? Shall we meet? I'm far away. Do you love me? Let's talk about it when we meet. When? I'll call you. Are you going home? You're not coming here? When can you check out? If you come, I'll wait for you. Will you take me home? Or shall we go somewhere else? I can't. Why not? Why? Now, I'm... I think it's best we take some time away from each other. Hello! Hey! Are you okay? Weren't you at the dock? Switch off the lights! He can see my face. Turn the damn lights off! You said not to see each other anymore. I'm going soon. I got private institute. I wanted to show you something, but I don't know your number. What is that? For me, it's proof of adultery. For him, it's proof of birth. When he gets older, he'll ask questions about how was he born. Where's this at? A gift. You came to see the baby? I didn't! You can go in now. I'm going to put this on him today. - 7th floor, room 8? - Mi-Hee Kim's baby. - Let me through! - You can't go in. Listen! It's true! All paperwork was filed yesterday. The baby's gone. Okay? I want to see for myself. - Calm down. Calm down. - You can't do this here. Talk to your mother. Yoon-ah! Yoon-ah! Listen to me. The baby was born with cerebral hemorrhaging. We did our best, but we couldn't save it. At least... you got to see his face. Where's the baby? Where is he! Ask your mother. Yoon-ah... - Yoon-ah! - You can't go in there! Was it adopted? You put it up for adoption, right? Don't do this here. Yoon-ah! Yoon-ah! Yoon-ah! Excuse me. Sir... is... He's the guy. - Stop the car! - Give me my brother back! Sir! I'll quit school, get a job. I'll make money, raise the kid. I'll get government support. I'll do it all myself. I'll be the mother, the father, and the sister. I'll raise him well. Please give him back to me. Give him back my brother... Are they all babies? Yes. This is all the filed documents. See if your brother's in it. My brother's not dead. So he's not there. And it's a lie. How can so many babies die the same day all together? Not the same day. A day, two days, sometimes a couple of weeks. I collect them all on the same day. (MI-HEE KIM'S BABY) Transport... cremation... Stop! Stop the car! It's all a lie! What're you going to do? You sure you want to do this? It's better to just take it to the crematorium. They'll all be burned together. If you move around now, it'll hurt later. I made some porridge. With abalone. Try it. It's all over. The doctor told me. Eat. You think I poisoned it? It's good. Have some. If you heard from the doctor, why did you come to see me? He hasn't been here. Okay? Go. You didn't know? Know what? That he had a family. I knew. Then how did you expect this to end? You try having an affair, and see if you can have it your way. Eat well. You're a patient Did you come here just to feed me? I have nowhere to go, so I came here. Hit me. And go. It's over. All of it. I came to see you in a hospital gown, pale faced, hair all oily, laying here. I came here to see that... and to feed you, to pass on comfort that won't comfort you, so I can catch a breath... and return to being a person again. Joo-ri, sweetie, Dad was on the way back from the business trip... But where's Mom? The baby is dead. But you were waiting for that to happen, weren't you? I don't want to be your daughter anymore. The fare's $480, alright? That's what it costs from Taean to here. You still can't honk at this hour. People are sleeping. - I told you to stop! - Take your hands off me Joo-ri! Joo... No, I can't get it for you. Let me do this then I'm angry to death. I know about it, but please calm down... I'm getting more angry. Please stop honking. I paid the taxi. And the hospital bills. Where's Joo-ri? You saw her? I think it's you who needs to go to the hospital. I think my arm's broken. Young-joo... I... Go to the hospital first. I was mugged. Joo-ri! Joo-ri! (YOU AND YOUR BABY) (BABY'S NAME: PUMPKIN) I thought it was your dad. Do you have to be just like him? You checked out alone? Yeah. Are you okay? It's a bit too late to ask that. You knew, didn't you? That's why you didn't go see him. Pumpkin. You're all grown up. And you've aged. You got more gray hair. I'm going to dye it. Mom. Couldn't you help me be fond of you at least a little? Why didn't you answer the phone? Why didn't you? Who are you? Do you know me? I don't know you. Shall we open it? You ran away, so you never saw him. It was you who said let's not see each other again. When did you ever listen to others? Where is your brother? I don't want to do this anymore. Is that so wrong?
