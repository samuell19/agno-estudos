My name is Christina Ruth Cromwell. I'm 17 and I live in New Rochelle. I think my stepfather is trying to murder my mother. I've told people that my stepfather is trying to murder my mother Nobody believes me. So, I'm writing this down, in case, something happens to me. It began several weeks ago. I was having a nightmare, when a strange sound echoed up through our house. Hi, Christie. I heard a weird noise. Like some kind of banging on the pipes. It must've been me. I was in the study doing some paper work. At this hour? I couldn't sleep. But I'm tired enough now. Aren't you coming? I think I'll have a snack. Make sure you turn off the lights. Good looking, isn't he? Nice too. Which is how he stole my mother away from my dad. He says, he's been working in his study. But his study is not back here. I should've sensed that something was wrong that night. But I didn't. If I had, things might've been different the next day. What happened? Just an accident. I thought this house had good wiring, though. You lived here long? Four months. When were you last in the basement? Me? Did you notice it? I was up here, waxing the floor when I heard this crackling sound like frying bacon. That's when the lights began flickering. About what time exactly did you find it? Mom? Shh. What's going on? Man from the power company came to read the meter and electrocuted himself. How did it happen? Mrs. Fox. Well, that's the lights on. Can I ask you a few questions? Of course. How long's it been since you had the wiring checked? Dumb son of a bitch. He never should've touched that box, not when it was wet. Must've seen the busted water pipe. Yeah, but who'd have seen it on the floor? Not me. Yeah, could've happened to anybody. Janey, I've got to talk to you. Jesus Christ, Cromwell! Don't you ever knock? Christie, wait in the kitchen. What's bothering you? You promised to tell me before you did anything with a boy, remember? It's because you're still a virgin, isn't it? That's why you're so upset. I'm upset because my stepfather just tried to murder my mother. No shit. I'm telling the truth, Josh Dealey. Your father is over at my house investigating it right now. What happened, anyway? A man from the power company touched that fuse box and got electrocuted. What's that got to do with Paul Fox? Well, he fixed it to kill mom. Anybody ever tell you you watch too much TV? Janey, you've gotta help me. I need your car to follow him, find out what's going on. Why don't you borrow your mother's? She's only got a dinky learner's permit. Shouldn't have flunked driver's ed. I didn't flunk. I dropped out, because I was sick. Yeah, in the head. Janey, please help me. No. Why not? You've been crazy to get Paul Fox ever since he married your mother. That's why you went to that shrink to get over your nutty fantasies. It wasn't a fantasy. I found the love letters Paul Fox wrote mom. They were mailed while she was still married to dad. That doesn't make him a murderer. Doesn't exactly make him a nice person, like my dad is. And when mom realizes that, she'll want him back. Christie, I said, no. I knew I was right about Paul Fox. I ditched school the next day. I waited outside the dealership my mom owned. She'd inherited it from her dad, along with a lot of the rest of the town. Paul Fox was just the salesman there when she met him. Okay, Mrs. Karen is coming in at three o'clock. And I want that car ready. I was embarrassed last time. I'm sorry, It'll be taken care of. - Okay, Marty. - Okay. He took a left then I lost him. The next day, I waited where he turned off. And sure enough, he came by again. Right on the other side. It was kind of discouraging, but I'm not the sort to get put off. I just came back a third day. I missed you. Won't be long before we're together all the time. What? Hey, you! It's Christie. He's back. Christie? Yes. Would you come in here a minute, please? I saw you at the Bohle house. Would you leave me alone, Paul? Peering through windows? That's wrong. Wrong? Well, what about you? Or don't you consider cheating on my mother wrong? Would you come in here, please? We have to talk. I don't have anything to say to you. Christie, I know you'd rather have your father here than me. But that's no reason for you to make up lies about me. Christie? I know that man getting electrocuted was no accident. I know you were in the basement that night shorting that fuse box. You can't be serious. Hello? Anybody home? Mom? I caught him cheating on you. What? That's just... He also fixed that fuse box that killed that man that was meant to kill you. Sweetie, calm down. You're hysterical. What is all this about? I gave a demonstration ride to a prospective customer today. Brenda Bohle. Christie did see us together. You never gave her any ride. I was about to, until you interrupted. Ms. Bohle asked me to pick her up at her house because she couldn't get to the agency. That's bullshit. Christie, don't talk like that. He's having an affair with this Bohle woman. I've been following him. Following him? How? On my bike. On your bike? Yeah, I just waited wherever I lost him the day before. Christie, would you please just stop? Okay, don't believe me. Just wait until he kills you. Christie, do you realize how you're hurting me? You're accusing the man I married of trying to murder me. But he is. Paul told me all about this Ms. Bohle. She's a nice girl. She works in Green's Department store. She even supports her older brother. He's out of work. Yeah. You should've seen the way she lit his cigarette. Everything getting straightened out up here? I'm afraid not. One thing I know for sure. You lied to me the other night about being downstairs working. You were in that basement. I know you were. You left the door open. You better show her, Paul. Look, Christie. This is just for you. I made it as a surprise for your birthday. That's what Paul was doing the other night. He was sneaking in from the car through this storm door so you wouldn't notice. Go ahead, open it. It's not gonna bite. Well, aren't you gonna thank Paul? Thank you, Paul. Is that the best you can do? A car would've been nicer. If you wanna follow me again, at least it'll be easier this time. That bike has 12 gears, you know? New Rochelle is the best. Mighty! Super! Don't stop! Let's do the same as last night. Slow down. Where's Janey? She's out sick, nothing serious. You all just have to help me follow my stepfather's girlfriend then. Christie, I haven't got a car, remember? Yeah, but my mother does. I just want you to ride with me, in case a cop stops me. You've the license, remember? I don't believe you. You're willing to steal a car. And you're afraid to get a traffic ticket. So long, nutso. I'll tell Janey, you've been coming on to Patty C, if you don't help me. Well, that'll worry her for five minutes. I'll tell your father, you've been sleeping with Janey. He'll congratulate me. I'll tell Janey's parents you're sleeping with her. This is a nice car. You sure you know how to drive? Yeah, sure. You flooded it. It always starts cold in the morning. Not this car. And it isn't morning. Fuck you, Josh Dealey. Where are we going? To Green's. That's where this Brenda Bohle works. When she leaves, we'll follow her. What if she doesn't leave? Well, we'll keep on waiting, until she does. Ah. Why did you stop like that? He cut in front of me. He was a mile ahead. Let me drive. I better go faster. Faster? I have to get there before this Brenda, what's her face, leaves. Hey, slow down, would you? Hey, slow down. I'm trying. The gas pedal's stuck. The brake! Hit the brake! It's no use. Nothing works. It's out of control. It won't move. Watch out. Oh, shit! The ignition, turn off the ignition. God damn it, kill the engine. Pull it over to the curb. I can't, the wheels' locked. You all right? He did this. What are you talking about? Paul Fox. He fixed this car, so it'll kill mom. You almost killed both of us, because of your lousy driving and then you wanna blame it on your stepfather? No, no way! Oh, shit. What almost killed you, the carburetor spring. Snaps a throttle back in the place after you step on the gas. It broke. How? Don't know. What's wrong? Nothing. Only they don't break often. In fact, that's the first one I ever saw. Goodnight, Christie. Goodnight. Mom. Oh, Paul, I love you so much. I love you too. Oh, Paul! I've been looking all over for you, I have to talk to you. I wanna talk to you too. You feel better today? Some. Shhh. Look, where can we get ourselves some privacy? You got your car with you. Come on. We can talk as you drive. Gotta follow Brenda Bohle. Well, don't just sit here, go to the motel. Christie, there's something I want to tell you. Later, this is more important than anything else right now. There, I told you. That's Paul's car. What do we do now? You just wait here. Oh, come on, Angela. God, you're just so typical. Soon as you get what you want you start bossin' around 'and treating me like shit.' You know, Paul, we can't go on like this, not forever. You can't rush something like this. I don't know. I'm trying, you know. Not hard enough. My brother keeps grumbling about all the time you're taking. Do we have to talk about it now? No. We don't have to talk about anything now. Our next song, "Here I Am." Janey! What? Come on, they're doing it! Would you forget locking the stupid car? What were they doing? Fucking. What? Yeah, you have to see it so when I tell my mom, you can back me up. Run! This way. This is crazy. Whoa! You watch where you're going. Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right? I'm sick. You're not kidding, come on, lean on me. How long has this been going on? Since last week. You gotta go see a doctor maybe. I did yesterday. Well, what did he say? I'm pregnant. Geez, no kidding? No kidding. It's what I've been wanting to tell you for the last three hours. Josh's? Yeah. Does he know? No. What're you gonna do? Get an abortion, of course. Don't you think, maybe, you should tell Josh? Why? It's not like he's gonna marry me or anything. I guess not. Hey, I like sleeping with him. I'm only 17, just like you. I'm not gonna settle down right now. I wanna party and travel. I have my whole life in front of me. Look out! Janey? Janey. Dr. Robinson, please report to the emergency room. Dr. Simmons... I'm sorry, Mrs. Rose, your daughter died. No! Okay, I'll tell her. Christie. Yes. She died on the operating table. The police commissioner would like to ask you a few questions if you feel up to it. Yes. Thanks for not telling your mother about what you saw today. Would she have believed me? Probably not, but I appreciate it anyway. I won't see Ms. Bohle again. Yeah. Police Chief's waiting, Christie. Will Dr. Ralph Applebaum report Dr. Ashby's office? I want you to tell me everything you remember about the accident. It wasn't an accident. Pardon? Janey was murdered. By who? Paul Fox. Why would Paul want to Murder Janey? Well, he didn't. He was trying to kill me. Why would he want to do something like that? Janey and I saw him at the Siesta Motel with this woman. Brenda Bohle, she works at Greens. He was afraid I'd tell mom. Only now there's no one to back my story up. For that he'd murder Janey? He's trying to kill my mother. That meter man was one of his attempts. That was an accident. They all look like accidents. Mom's car went out of control yesterday while Josh was with me. It almost killed us. Ask him. All right, I will. If that isn't enough, go to the motel. Paul's car was parked out back. It's a gray Chrysler Laser. You'll find Janey's car there. Paul spotted us and we had to run for it. Was it the Laser that hit Janey? No, but Paul can get whatever car he wants off of mom's lot. I'll look into it, Christie. Thank you, Mr. Dealey. Don't you worry, Christie. At last I had found someone who was going to help me. I just stay out of Paul Fox's way until the police commission had enough proof to arrest him. Karen. Hi, Bob. Nice to see you. I wasn't worried, even when commissioner Dealey came to the house and Paul seemed so friendly. That's how the police are with suspects, I guess. They get their confidence. But I'm keeping up my diary, just in case. What do you write in the diary all the time anyway, Christie? The life and times of a teenage sex maniac? Not only is he an incompetent murderer, he's a total asshole. Hi, I'm Christie Cromwell, Mr. Peacock sent for me. I'll tell him you're here. Well, if it isn't the undertakers best friend. Oh, what's that supposed to mean? Oh, you figure it out. No, you tell me. Okay, you asked for it. If it hadn't been for you leading Janey off on that wild goose chase, she'd be alive today. That's not true. Janey was my best friend. I didn't want anything to happen to her. Yeah, that's why she's dead. Out of the way, sicko. Take your hands off her, Charlie. Lighten up, Josh! We're just razzin' her a little about what happened to Janey. Yeah? Well, you've got a pretty sick sense of humor. Now, beat it. It's her fault. And everybody knows it in this school. I don't know that. And Janey was my girlfriend. Now beat it, both of you. Thanks, Josh. Christie, Commissioner Dealey is waiting in my office to talk to you. Come in. You wanted to see me, Mr. Dealey? You found out something about Paul Fox, right? I've found out you're just about the worst kid I've ever dealt with. What? Your stepfather, he was no more at that motel yesterday than he murdered Janey Rothstein. How do you know that? At the time of the hit and run, he was with your mother at the dealership. So, he had somebody else do it for him. He was still at that motel yesterday. He wasn't registered. Then Brenda registered. Her brother says he was with her on her lunch hour. He's lying! Someone at the motel must've seen one of them. Did you ask? Nobody registers at that place by the right names. And nobody sees anybody else there. At least they won't admit to it. What about Janey's car? Did you find that there? That proves you two were there. Not much else. We wouldn't have left the car if we hadn't been running for our lives. Paul Fox was chasing us. Don't you believe me? You know, you're a real little actress. I might even have believed you, if I hadn't talked to your mother. My God! You didn't tell her about this? I certainly did. And she told me all about how you blame Paul Fox for her having divorced your father. She also told me about your therapy. And the wild accusations you have been making. But they're all true! They're all true! Hi. Hi, come on in. Dad told me about what happened in school today. I thought maybe you could use some company. Where're your folks? They went to the Rotary Club Dance. Josh, would you help me break into Brenda Bohle's house? Oh, come on, Christie. Well, listen, it's only over on Stone Avenue. I'll break in, you just keep watch outside. Christie, stop it. Mom's gonna die, Josh. Just like Janey. Christie, shh. Josh, you have to leave. What are you scared of? Nothing. You're afraid of what you were feeling when we were kissing, weren't you? Josh. Come on. Josh, just leave, please? I'm sorry. It's just that, well, I'm missing Janey too. And suddenly you were sitting so close. Goodnight. Josh! What? Let's go up to my room, okay? No, don't. Josh, there's something you should know. I already know, Janey told me. You've never done this before. No, it's about Janey. You all right? I'm sorry, it just hurts so much. Oh, shit! Paul! Well, what have you two been up to? Please use the front door on your way out. So you don't run into my wife. She's making a pot of tea in the kitchen. What're you and mom doing home so early? Between you and the police chief today, she wasn't much up to a night on the town. God knows what she'd do if she found out about this. Look, Christie... Out! You're not gonna tell mom. I'm not like you, Christie. I'm very forgiving of other people's sexual foibles. Even yours. Goodnight. Oh, my God, I'm bleeding! What? No! I'm only going to the bathroom. What is it Paul? Are you all right? Yes, I'm fine. I just caught my finger in the door. What's wrong with you? You didn't catch your finger in any door. Gas! My God, you're gonna kill me too! I have no idea what you're talking about, Christie. Of course, you have to kill me. If mom dies, I get her money, not you. And if this had blown up now, you would have been killed too. There is a slight smell of gas. I'll have to have that heater looked at. Snap to it, Christie. I don't want you missing the school bus again. I'll put the coffee on, Paul. You did it! You finally did it! Oh. For Christ's sakes, call an ambulance. Just the clean break. You can stay tonight, or go home today if you want. I'll go home today. Thank you, doctor. Well, I should call the office and let them know where we are. Then I'll take you home. Telephone for Dr. Isaac Roland, Dr. Isaac Roland. Mom. What? Please don't go home. Not for a night or two, anyway. Why not? Mom, that riser was bent. So you tripped. Oh, Christie! Don't start again. I probably bent it when I fell. Mom, Paul did it, I know he did. Christie, stop. Here we are, darling. Christie and I can take turns wheeling you around. Can't we, Christie? Easy, ma'am, easy. You're gonna like this kinda treatment. I suddenly knew what I had to do. I went to the Bohle House that afternoon and waited till Paul showed up. Then I waited some more. Then I decided to make a run for it. Okay, do you wanna fight? Then fight and get it over with. Well, what are you waiting for? Yeah, yeah. Fuck me! Lacey! Oh, no! That was my goddamn stepdaughter. Don't worry about it, Paul. We'll find her. You better. I'm going. Which way did she go? How the hell do I know? I was busy. You check the side gate. I'll check the front. I can't see her around here. We haven't tried the back yet. There's no sign of her. Check out back. Hey, Brenda! Yeah? I thought you said you didn't like it. Like what? Fucking Paul Fox! What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about. Look at this! Where did you get that? That girl took it. So what does a picture prove, huh? I've told you, I've got to keep sleeping with him until he kills them. And then we can do whatever we want. Liar! I did it for you. Ow, ow! You're fucking him 'cause you enjoy it! Huh? That how you get off? By having him and me at the same time? Lacey, no! I told you, we don't get anything. We don't get anything until he kills them. Then we can blackmail him for everything! But he isn't going to do it unless I keep on pushing him! How? By fuckin' him every day? This is the only way! Lacey, please! You're my husband! You're the one I love! Let me in! Lacey! Just listen to me, for once. Let me in! Lacey, no, no! Don't bleed on the floor! Stick your head in here. Who's that? I don't know. Here. Clean yourself up and answer it. Is this the Smith residence? No one lives here by that name. Are you sure? I mean, this is the right address. Get lost. Hi! Here. Go on. Get outta here! That'll get you moving, Paulie. Josh! Hey, Christie! Josh, you saved my life! How did you know I was here? When you didn't show up for English class, I got worried. I kept remembering what you'd said about wanting proof. And I also wanted to tell you that I was sorry for last night. Forget it. No, It's important. Look, I didn't mean to hurt you. It's okay. I understand. You do? Yeah. Sex is just plain horrible. Look at this. I guess that takes care of your mother and Paul Fox. Christie, making love won't be like it was that first time between me and you. And it wouldn't be like in this picture. I promise. Josh, I don't want to hurt your feelings, but I don't want to go to bed with you again. I don't want to go to bed with anybody, ever again. I'm sorry. Mom? Give it to me! Give me that picture! Leave me alone, Paul! Let her go! What's going on here, anyway? I asked her a simple question about where she'd been and she called me a vile name. He's lying! Look, Karen, I can explain everything. It's not like it looks. Don't you touch me. I'm not gonna hurt you. It was a simple affair, nothing more. I don't wanna talk about it. We've got to talk about it. I just want you out of this house now. Oh! That's for every time I kissed you and wanted to throw up. You think it was for your money? You think that's why I've been trying to kill you. Well, it wasn't. I've always hated you. Ever since I was a kid, watching you drive pass with your rich daddy and his big car. Well, I finally got rich by marrying you. But I didn't love you. Touching you, talking pretty to you, made my skin crawl. Think about that the rest of your life. Oh, my God! You're bleeding. Go away, Christie. I'll get you a cold towel. No, just go away, please. Please. Everything all right, Mrs. Cromwell? Yes, Seudi. Shall I draw the curtains before I go home? He never loved me. All these months. He never loved me. That's how it happened. I guess it's just mom and me now. I'll have to help take care of her. To see nothing like this happens again. All my life I wanted to love and be loved. But love can sure do terrible things. At least now, it's all over. Oh, my God! Mom! Christie? I'm down here in the living room. Mom, quick, we've gotta get out of here. Christie, what is it? I saw Paul and Brenda Bohle outside. They're coming to kill us. Mom, please don't argue. Oh, my God! Paul, still got his keys. Hi. Oh, God. Just one big happy family. Ouch! Your fault, Christie. You should never have shown your mother that picture. No! Don't make her bleed, otherwise we'll have to clean it up. Sit! What do we do now? Put them in the basement till about two in the morning. That'll be a good time for a burglar to break in. What do you think of Lacey's plan, honey? I'll try to stop the burglar, of course, and then knocked unconscious. He'll kill everyone else in the house. Paul, you can't do this. Not me, baby cakes. Him. Look, Christie. Ah. No hands. Mom! Mom, are you all right? Oh, Christie, Christie. Come on get up. No. Cellar's this way. This is for every time I kissed you. I wanted to throw up. See you at two, Karen, darling. Help, we have to get help. We'll find a way out. Wait a second, Christie. Help, help, help. Mom. If you scream they'll hear us. They'll just kill us earlier. You're right, I just panicked. She stopped yelling. Let's gag 'em. Nobody's gonna hear 'em. We've got five acres of grounds here. Five acres? Valuable property. Mom, the storm doors, the storm doors to the outside they're not locked, are they? No, they're not. We can get out through the storm doors. Easy there. Here, let me look at it. Oh, we'll wrap this around it. You bastard! Hurting an innocent child! She's a slut. Caught her in bed fucking that little friend of hers, Josh Dealey. Okay, so maybe I did go to bed with Josh. But Josh loved me. It's not like you and Brenda, Paul. She doesn't love you. She loves Lacey. You think he's her brother, don't you? Well, he's not. He's her husband. And he hates you for sleeping with her. She doesn't even like you. She's only doing it so they can get mom's money. Once we're dead, they'll blackmail you for all the money you got from my mother. That's all right. No, no. You got it locked? Yeah. They're not going anywhere. Got some ketchup, honey? Thanks. There's got to be a way out of here. There isn't. There's always a way, Christie. Christie, what you said through the storm doors, prove it. How? I'm gonna take you up into the kitchen and you follow my lead. Slip into the conversation whatever you heard them say. I'll watch their reaction. Lacey, will kill us both. Do it. Maybe, I'll find a way out of this for you and your mother. You don't, you're both gonna die. You're gonna kill us anyway, no matter what you say. Leave her alone. Christie, do what he says. What's she doing here? She's gonna make blueberry pancakes. She makes great pancakes. I can make pancakes. Kid makes 'em better. How do you know? You ever taste my pancakes? Shut up, Brenda. The man wants the girl to cook for him. Let her do it. Right, Paulie? So, Brenda, how long have you and Lacey been married? You got it all wrong, kid. Lacey's my brother. Oh, come on, Brenda. I was hiding in your house when two were fighting. I heard everything. I know Lacey's your husband. Shut up! You bastards! Lying to me? I wanted to tell you, Paul. But I was afraid I'd lose you. Liar. No, I'm telling you the truth. He doesn't mean anything to me. It's you. You're the one I love. What happened? They're fighting. Come on. Oh, I'll never make it. Yes, you will. I can't. Here. I thought you'd like to see what your big mouth got ya. Nothin'! That's what it got ya. We're still gonna kill you. And Paulie here, is gonna say that he tried to stop it. That's why he got beaten up by the burglar. And then he's gonna give Brenda and me a whole big chunk of his inheritance. Aren't you Paulie, huh? The next time you hear me coming, it's to kill ya. That'll be in about two hours. Have a nice wait, ladies. We're dead. No, we're not. You're not gonna die, you understand me? That window I broke. Maybe you can squeeze through the bars. I'm not leaving you. Christie, you have to. I'm not leaving you! Josh. It's Josh, I know it is. I told you it'd stop. Answer it. If you don't, whoever it is may come over here. If that happens, maybe the cops won't be far behind. They've answered it. I told you, Josh. She doesn't wanna talk to you. Now please, don't call here again. That should take care of that little bastard. There's only one way. What? What do you mean, Christie? I'm gonna have to kill them. They're just waiting there on the ridge, why? They'll come at us soon enough. How many are there, do you think? 500, maybe a thousand. This is it. They're moving. You ready? On the count of 20. On the count of 20, slowly. From when you hear the door close. Hey, Brenda! Brenda! Brenda! What do you want? I have to pee. Squat and do it down there. The cops will find traces of urine. It won't add up when we're supposed to have been murdered in our beds. One, two, three, four, five, six. Taking her for a pee. Eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13 14, 15, 16 17, 18, 19. Leave it open. 20. Ow! What's goin' on? Brenda, is that you? She's escaped, Lacey! You little bitch! She got away! Stop her! She's got a knife! Brenda? Yeah? Where is she? I don't know. In here somewhere. Paul, you there? Yeah. You and Brenda stay where you are. I'm gonna flush the brat out. Bitch. Jesus, Brenda, stop it! You're gonna hit one of us. Will this help? Brenda, go to the basement, get the lights on. Bring the lighter. Come with me. Come on out, you bitch! There's no way out! Come on out! You don't want me to kill you right now. Come on out! Come on. Get away from the fuse box. Get away, you bitch! No, no! She's in her room. I'll take care of her. Go see what's happening in the basement. I know you're in here. I know you're not going anywhere. Not with your mother downstairs. So why don't you come on out? Aha! I know where you are. "Come out, come out," said the big bad wolf. "Or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down." Come out, you little cunt! Got her. Look at me! You did this. Time to die, sweet child. Who is it? Josh, Josh Dealey. One word, it's your brains all over the wall. Get rid of him! I can't, not like this. What is it, Josh? I wanna see Christie. Get her mother here. It's the middle of the night, for Christ's sakes! Go on home before I call your father. I'm not going home until I see Christie. Stall him. Okay, Josh. I'll get her outta bed, but it'll take a moment. Now, you listen, cunt. You get rid of him, or I'll kill not only you and your mother, but him too. Brenda, cover the old lady. I got her covered. Paulie, into the living room. You understand now? She's the first to go, then you and the boy. Open it. Hi, Josh. What're you doin' up this late? I called earlier. Your stepfather answered. He wouldn't let you come to the phone. So? He's an asshole. What's he even doing in the house? Didn't you show your mother, that picture of him and that woman? Yeah, I did. But she forgave him. She did? Even after seeing that picture? You know what they say, love is blind. Oh, Josh, can't you see I'm lying. Oh, he can, he can. What're you doing dressed? I was still up, doing some homework. At one in the morning? Look, something's wrong, isn't it? No, of course not. Look, I wanna come in and talk to you. Come on, let me in. Listen, you little asshole, I'm being punished. After you were through with me the other night I was bleeding all over the place. Mom found my clothes, I had to tell her why. What we did wasn't wrong. We care about each other. You can tell your mother that? I couldn't. Why not? Because I don't care about you, you stupid idiot. Don't even like you. I just wanted to lose my cherry to someone. Anyone, even a garbage man. Now leave me alone. Is he gone? Yeah. Oh. Let's kill them now and get it over with. Not until we clean this place up. Looks like a slaughter house in here. It's my ass. Police will be suspicious. If he gets busted, we don't get any money. We kill' em at two o'clock. Let's put' em in the basement. You all right, mom. Yeah, I guess. What happened? I heard you screaming. Tried to stop Brenda from turning the lights back on. Oh, mom. It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. Oh, Josh, please don't believe what I just told you. Please don't. You're gonna kill yourself. Not if I don't ground it. Where did you learn all this? Shop, it's the best elective I ever took at school. Even if all the other girls did laugh at me. Can I have the cover? Hey, you know, my wife went to the gym. Yeah, she lost 20 pounds in the first visit. Come on let's get' em. Didn't come here to watch TV. How long before it shorts out? On a guess, five minutes. They should be here soon. Where's Paulie? Finishing off the whiskey. Once this shorts, whoever tries to fix it is gonna die. What about a ground? That's the ground. Ready? Coming up or do I have to come down and get ya. We're coming. Where do we kill 'em? Upstairs in their beds. Come on. She's too goddamned much trouble to get upstairs in that cast. I'll do it down here. What about the cops? So they'll think she heard a noise. Got out of bed to investigate. Mom. Come here. The lights please, the lights. What lights? Goddamn it, come on. Go mom, run. No more running, baby. It's all over. Do you believe me now? Yeah, yeah, I believe you. Car 72, calling Central. This is the Police Commissioner, I am at 38. I'll deal with her. Go fix the lights in the basement. Goodbye, mother. Brenda. There's a way in around back. Let's go. I know you're in here. Come on out. Okay, make me stoop. But it's the last thing I'm ever gonna do for you. Oh, that's where you are. That's Christie's room. Oh. Oh. Karen? Brenda. Christie. Josh. Christie. Break that door down! Christie. Oh, mom. Oh, baby. You all right? Mom, do you have to go? Commissioner Dealey wants me to go through our house with him. He has a lot of questions. Still looking for Lacey Bohle, isn't he? That's why you are going back, to make sure he is dead. Don't even think it. Mom, I want to know he's dead just as bad as you do. You'll be safe here, this is the police commissioners house. I'll send Josh by to keep you company. Mom? Josh? Josh. Josh, is that you? Josh, I was so scared. About what? I thought, you were Lacey, coming to get me. Don't be dumb. He's a million miles away by now. Then he did escape, he's crazy. Don't worry, they'll catch him. You know something, I really do care about you. Crazy, huh, this is for Brenda. Yeah. This is Christie Cromwell. I'd like to speak to the commissioner. It's Christie Cromwell, sir. She'd like to speak to you. Hello, Christie. Mr. Dealey, I think this time you'll believe me.
