Where is it? What are you doing, Yuri? Where's my other shoe?/ You're holding it. I know, but where's the other shoe? You're wearing it. Yeah. Why did you drink, anyway? It was a moment of weakness./ Weakness? Weakness is this much, you drank the whole bottle. Turns out I like it. Sorry./ Yuri... Your breath stinks./ I already brushed my teeth. It stinks of alcohol. What should I do? What if they find out? I'm screwed./ That's your problem. Are we back in the club? We're in the middle of a road, Yuri. And it's eerily dark. That means the disco ball followed us here. Yuri... What is that thing? You can see it too? You're drunk aren't you?./ What are you doing? Do you know what time is it now? Do you know what the time is? Is the lamp broken? Don't ask about the lamp. I asked you what time is it now, not about the lamp. Where have you been, Ndro?/ Where's Ale? Is he asleep?/ Of course, it's 1 o'clock in the morning. He's definitely asleep now. There, you know what time it is now. Why did you even ask me, anyway? I'm asking you, where have you been? It's unusual for you to go out without telling... ...and coming home in the middle of the night and leaving your phone at home. What's the meaning of all this? Are you having an affair? I'm desperately in love with you. So tell me why did you came home this late? Where were you? Would she believe me even if I do tell her? I was with.../ With who, Ndro? Should I tell the truth? I was with.../ Your lover? Your mistress? Your new friend? Darn, how should I break it to her? I was with.../ With who, Ndro? I was with... Whatever. Worst case, I'll be sleeping on the sofa. An alien. An alien?/ Yeah, an alien. You're crazy, Ndro. If you want to lie to me, pick one that makes sense. I'm not lying to you. And you expect me to believe that you met an alien? Is that right? It is true, Nita. Now, tell me how did you meet the alien. I'm curious. Okay, I'll tell you. It's better than being accused of having an affair. Well, what are you waiting for? Okay, but you have to imagine it in your head. Fine. I was in a bus on my way to pick up my bike in the parking lot. Your alien is very scary, Ndro. Not that kind of alien. This one looks like it wears a costume. Like this? That's the Iron Man./ You said it wears costume. We're not talking about a super hero. Like this? Nita, that's an Ondel-ondel. No, I won't look at it. I'm too scared. Why did you do that? You know I hate horror movies. Your imagination is too wild, we're talking about alien. Not this kind of creature. Make it go away! He's sulking. Are you sure we're not talking about a long wavy haired alien? Yes./ Fine. Tell me what the alien looks like. Hey, boss. Even street singers, clowns, pick pockets, all pay the bus fare. I know it's hard for you to find any job with that hideous mask. But I'm working for a living too. Now, pay up. What? Now you're giving me big bucks? Are you showing off? That's too big. I don't have any change. We just began the trip. I don't have smaller money. I recently exchanged them from the money changer. Just use this. Here's the change./ Keep it./ Thanks. Unlike him who's stingy. Thanks./ No problem. By the way, I'm Indro./ Thanks, Indro. Are you going to a cosplay event?/ Sorry? Cosplay. People who wear costumes, like you. I wear this everyday./ No, what I mean is this. Sorry. This. If his beard is like this, how's his armpit hair? Let me introduce myself. My name is Alien. You can call me Al. Hold on. Hold on. How can I believe that there's an alien named Alien. And his nickname is Al? Why not call him Al-El-Dul as well? And don't tell me his mother is Bunda Maia. I don't know anything about his mother. But his wife's name is Elizabeth. And she is called El. Are you really an alien?/ I have proof if you don't believe me. We call this boomerang around here. You look like a president in this picture. I'm not a president, I'm a king. I'm the King of Aliens. Awesome!/ I know, right? It's getting more absurd./ It's real. Fake./ Real. If he's real, how come he can speak Bahasa Indonesia? Do you think there's a Bahasa Indonesia teacher that taught him there? Might as well tell him to speak Sundanese. I already asked him that. And you know what? He can also speak Sundanese. If you really are an alien, how come you speak Bahasa Indonesia? Fortunately, I have a gift to speak any languages in the universe. I just tune in the frequency. Can I test you?/ Sure. What's 'you be quiet' in Russian? In Vietnamese? In Sundanese? You're nuts, Ndro. You're story is way too absurd. What is 'cicing sia anying' anyway? Is he an alien or a comedian? Wait, where are you going?/ I'm getting something to drink. Listening to your absurd story makes my dehydrated. It is absurd. And why did he come to Earth? If that's the case, why do you come to Earth? I'd better tell you all about my home and what made me come to Earth. I live far away from Earth. These are solar systems. That small furry planet is my home. My planet's name is.../ Wait a moment! Since when is there a furry planet? Ndro, please tell your wife not to interrupt my story. She is distracting me./ You're a sensitive alien, huh? Let me start from the beginning again. That small furry planet is my home. It's called Alien us Planet. This is our planet. Although there's global competition, our citizens are busy fighting among themselves. We fight over the simplest matter, over the smallest cause. All nonsensical fights. Even among the same polka dots species, we fight a lot over nothing. We fight over choosing a neighborhood leader... ...to choosing different underwear colors. Our planet, which is supposed to go forward... ...went backward instead because of all the fighting. It makes me sad to see it. Even though we live in the most beautiful planet in the universe. Hold on, the most beautiful? Better than Earth? I don't believe you. I think you're confused. It's according to the statistical data. That's why I always go on a trip for comparative study. Just like the officials in your country. They're just taking a vacation. A vacation? I'm doing it for comparative study. Originally, I planned to go to Mercury, but our relationship is strained... ...due to the planet's name dispute. And I'm afraid to go to Venus. Why? Because there are only females in that planet. So what if it's full of females?/ Well... My wife. What about your wife?/ She's gets jealous easily. She never believes me. She's insecure. Whenever I come home late, she'd interrogate me. The smallest mistake can make her angry. Your marriage is so complicated./ I know. How about your wife? My wife is.../ Stop. If you want to complain about me, don't use alien as your excuse. What do you mean?/ It's obvious. You've been talking a lot about aliens and that rambutan planet. You did all that just so you can criticize me, right? No, I'm not criticizing you. I'm telling the truth. That's how Mr. Al's wife is. He said she loves to interrogate him. If that's the description of the alien's wife. How did you describe me?/ Don't interrupt me, then. How about your wife? My wife is nothing like yours. She's beautiful, smart, sweet, can recite prayers, a good cook... ...and very gentle. Did you really say that? Wow, she suddenly appeared. Just like a parking guy, appearing out of nowhere. Luckily I was saying nice things about her. I came to Earth to find "sumber damai" (source of peace). When I asked around, they told me to take this bus. To Sumber Damai? Have you made an appointment? Not yet./ Why did you nod if you haven't? It's true, I haven't. Okay. I can take you to that place. We're heading in the same direction. Stop here! Sumber Damai is famous throughout Jabotabek. Nothing comes close. Mom, can we have a picture with that clown? Okay. Thanks, Mr. Clown./ Bye! It's so easy to get money in your planet. We don't really need skills to get money on Earth. What do you mean?/ You don't really need talent. As long as you're not shy to claim that you're talented. People like them are the ones who will get lots of followers... ...endorsements, and receive a lot of money. But if we really think about it, do they really have any talents at all? In this episode, we'll talk about iron. We are going to use the iron as a weapon against someone. But you have to remember one thing. Don't use the iron for... My message to you, don't use it as a tool for domestic abuse. No talent whatsoever. But I think nobody have social media in your planet, right? Look. You look just like that person. Wearing ridiculous outfit, singing and dancing for money. So that means they're not talented?/ Not that, they just really need the money. When you're in need, anything can be claimed as talent. “Sumber Damai” (Source of Peace) Assalamualaikum. Excuse me. So you went to a massage parlor? We did. The reflexology massage. Liar! I bet you went to a shady massage parlor. It's a normal massage parlor. I took Mr. Al to a massage parlor. You went there too once. Ndro, why did the alien need a massage anyway? Was his feet sore? Listen to the whole story. Ndro, to get the source of peace, maybe I need to get a scrubbing? What do you mean?/ You know my planet is in chaos. Maybe scrubbing can bring peace to them. If you give them scrubbing, you won't bring peace to them. But they'll definitely be free of dead skin. Wait a moment. When you said source of peace, do you literally mean the source of peace? I'll explain it more clearly. I've received information that I can find the source of peace on earth. So I came to this planet to find it and bring it home. Then this isn't what we're looking for./ So where is it? So where should I go to find the source of peace? To be honest, I don't know either. But to make your travel worthwhile, how about we do this? How about if I take you for a cup of coffee? After that, I can accompany you go around the world. While we're at it, I can show you that our planet... ...is just as beautiful as yours. Planet Aliando./ It's Planet Alien us. What?/ Alien us. Aliando. Can we stop by the parking lot to pick up my bike first? It's not far. Hey, Swindler. How dare you trick me. Astaghfirullah. You should've begin with your greetings first. Assalamu'alaykum./ Wa'alaykumussalam. You swindler! How dare you trick me. What are you talking about?/ This thing. You said this marmot can shoot. I gave it a gun, and it just nibbled on it. I've already imagined that my son played a shooting game with it. Where the marmot hides. And my son shoots it. And the other way around. You lied to me. Astaghfirullah. I've never said that this marmot can shoot. When did I say that? Never! You tricked me and now you're denying it? Don't you know who I am in Deli Serdang? I was the leader of the flag ceremony. Check this out. Look, half right dress. Want to see me make you stand at ease? How dare you lie to me. I lied to you? I'm an honest seller. You can ask other sellers. I'm as honest as a person can possibly be. And if I lie, I'd be honest to them. And I'm honest right now, I'm honest! You're giving me a headache. I'm gonna... Calm down, man... Calm down, man./ Your hands... Lower your hands. Let's be civil. Let's talk in a friendly manner. Don't get violent. Calm down, you two. What's going on here? My friend said, in this market there's a marmot seller... ...who got a marmot that can shoot. When I bought it, it won't do anything. And your friend saw it himself? He knows it from his friend's friend. His friend's friend is a fabric seller in this building too. My friend got the information from him. Did you ever tell him that this marmot can shoot? No, I've never once said that. As you can see for yourself. This is just a normal marmot. But this is a Rainbow Edition. Did you hear that? All of you? This is Rambo Marmot. Rambo can shoot, right? If Rambo can't shoot, the name should be changed to Rempong. And this animal can't shoot. I'll shoot you instead. Hold on. Hold on. Put down your gun. Calm down. This is just a small problem. It happens all the time in my planet. It's called 'hoax spreading method'. I bet this began when you said... Ipah, your cake isn't the only thing that's rainbow now. Look at my rainbow marmot. Rambo? You mean the shooting expert? Thank you. That seller is crazy. He said his marmot is Rambo. Rambo? Our place will be peaceful if a marmot can shoot. And from that point, the news about the marmot spread uncontrollably. How's your new wife doing?/ She's happy at home. How about your first wife?/ She's still in shock. But I'm also in shock./ What? I've heard that a seller over there sells a marmot that can shoot. Marmot? The animal that looks like a rat? Correct./ It can shoot? The name Rambo explains it all./ I have to tell my friends. Here, I'll take this. A marmot that can shoot? Yeah. Hello. Are you still collecting marmots? I've heard that you went to Zimbabwe just to look for them. You don't need to search so far away. I found a marmot that can shoot in Pasar Rakyat (People's Market). I know. I'll send the news to our messaging group. Okay. Are you going to bring the marmot to your planet, Mr. Al? Yeah. A souvenir for my wife. Mr. Indro! Hey, Mr. Duda (widower). It's Didu. What took you so long? This parking lot doesn't allow overnight parking. I know. I was in a hurry yesterday./ Even if you're in a hurry, still. All I know is that your bike made me miss a concert last night. What concert?/ JKT, of course. I even bought the handshake ticket. You can do the handshake later. When?/ On Eid al-Fitr. Asking for forgiveness? Okay, give me your ticket. It's just that, it made me anxious. I couldn't sleep peacefully thinking your bike is still here. Thanks for caring a lot about my bike, Mr. Dadu (dice). That's for gambling. Here you go. The change?/ Keep it. That's more like it. I can sleep peacefully tonight. Hey, parking boy!/ Excuse me. Yes./ Ndro. Do you think the source of peace is in this parking lot? What do you mean?/ When you gave him money... ...he felt at peace. Even his face is glowing with peace. Money is just to make ends meet. It can't buy peace. There's a lot of rich people that can't find peace in their lives. We sentence the defendants with 20 years in jail. I see./ Let's find some peace. What is that called, Ndro? This is called a helmet. On Earth... ...we have to wear helmet when we ride on motorbike. In my planet we call it 'Darto'. Good morning, Sir./ Good morning, officer. When you ride a motorbike, both the driver and the passenger... ...should wear helmets. Does it apply to aliens too?/ Of course. Justice is blind. Not favoring some people, whether you have long hair or short. Everyone is equal before the law. May I see your license and registration, please? My condolences. Excuse me?/ Your registration is dead. Can you please follow me to the station? Yes, Sir. I think I need to give him peace offering. That's wonderful! Now I understand./ Understand about what? I understand why you're home late. You've got pulled over by the police, your registration is expired... ...and you were jailed, am I right? You're making it up. You're not the only one who can make up a story. I can do it too. Tell me your version of the story./ My version is simple. I don't need aliens in the story. The police pulled you over, and you follow the policeman. That's it. Let me tell you my story. Please continue, Officer. So, what are you going to do? If you ask me, "the orange smells fragrant" I can arrange what you want. You want a ticket, or you want help? When you mention help, you mean peace offering, right? What are you grinning about? Are you making fun of an officer? Get up./ Sir... Do 50 squat jumps! Officer, don't give him 50 squat jumps. Give him 100! Yeah, 100 squat jumps! There were no squat jumps in my story! He's talking back at you, Sir. Give him 150. 150 times! Now!/ Right now! Nita... You'd better tell me the truth. You came home late because the officer punished you. Being punished and coming home late are two different things. Look at the time now. What time is it now, Sir? It's 11 AM. I bet you got an F for creative writing in the elementary school. Why did you say I had to do squat jumps? Because your story is too boring. A tip for you, make the story short. Do you want me to continue?/ Yeah. But tell me the truth. The truth is... What is it, Ndro?/ Watch out. Don't cut in during my story. You'll ruin my story. Alright. I'm just going to cut my apple. Go on. So, here's the situation. Life is already hard. So don't make easy things become complicated. Let's make peace. Peace on Earth, peace in our hearts. I wonder who I quoted. That's right. I'm looking for peace. Peace is the most important thing in the universe. So, life is like playing football. You're the striker. And I'm the back player who pass you the ball. Know what I mean? But Ronaldo always dribbles the ball accross the field alone. But don't forget, even if Ronaldo has the ball... ...his teammate is the one who passed it to him. Please take this. As long as I can find peace. What is this? We're talking about football. Why did you give me money? Are you trying to set me up? You're nodding./ He didn't mean that. Do you think it's funny? You're nodding again! You really are trying to set me up. Recording me, and uploading it in your social media account. Is that it? He's nodding again! You want to set me up! Is there an antenna here? Turn your head over here. Are you recording me? Again? Lift up your t-shirt./ Just my belly, Sir. Close it! What's this? That's a marmot, Sir./ It looks like a color TV. I'm serious. I have a lot of money. You may take the money, Sir. If you want more... ...I can get you more from the ATM. As long as I can bring peace to my planet. Offside! You've been trying to provoke me all this time. You've made me mad. Take this./ Okay, Sir. I will take care of the ticket. I want to apologize for my friend. I promise you, we're not recording anything. Just go! Excuse me. What are you still doing here? Peace, Sir. Do you think I'm the kind of policeman who take bribe money? Never! Peace, Sir. Where's the house? I think this is the house. I think I'm right. Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me! Yeah, yeah./ 'Yeah, yeah, ' hurry up! Hello, Bro./ Don't you call me Bro. Why is there a bemo here? Ma'am. Good evening, Ma'am. Good evening. Excuse me, Ma'am. I'm here to take your heart. I mean, take the bemo. I wouldn't dare taking your heart. Okay, Ma'am. Man! You're so inconsiderate! Giving me a bike I can't start. The bike is cool but I don't know how to start it! After you gave me the keys, I had to push it to my home. And from my home to here. My legs are killing me. You just have to turn the key and push the starter. I don't know which one to push. Your bike has so many buttons. Why didn't you return my bemo?/ Sorry, I came home too late. I don't care. My wife will kill me if I don't drive my bemo tomorrow. You know how today's wives are, just like a lioness when angry. Not you, Ma'am. You're as sweet as a doe, stealing cucumber. You may steal my cucumber. I mean, no! What would I eat if you steal it. Okay. Where's my bemo? It's here! Fine. I'll take my leave, Ma'am./ Okay. Good night, Ma'am./ Night. Can you tell me about that bemo? Calm down. I'm getting there. Oh, my God. What was all the noise about?/ Why aren't you in bed? I was, but I woke up when I heard voices. I thought it was Batman. You just got home?/ No, I got home hours ago. Why aren't you sleeping yet? I'm telling your mom a story. What story? Better sleep now, or you can't get up early tomorrow. Come. I want a bedtime story! Okay, let's go. What kind of story do you want? How about a story about an alien?/ What does the alien do? He's riding a bemo./ How come? Of course. Because everyone is equal before the law. And peace is priceless. I think we have to find another ride, Mr. Al. There's no helmet that will fit on your big head. If we keep riding this, we'll just get pulled over again. Ndro, there's a purple monster! It's eating a human. Look at the half eaten legs. His legs are ugly. That's not a monster, Mr. Al. That's a bemo. It's a vehicle too. Just like a bus, a car, and bike. Let's go. Excuse me, Sir. Are you available?/ No. For the love of God! Gagay!/ I'm not gay, I'm straight. What's with his big head? He soaked it in kerosene? Can you take us? No. I'm still on my break. Find another bemo. There's no way you're not available. I'm waiting for my son. It's his birthday today. I want to take him to Pasar Rakyat (People's Market). What are you buying there?/ The people? Like for election?/ Why the stupid question? I want to buy him toys, of course. Maybe a pet. My son loves all animals. We have three cats, five turtles in our house. This is five./ It's in Roman numerals. That's why I will take him to Pasar Rakyat. I hear they sell pets that can shoot. They say it's called Marmot Rambo. I want to buy it for him. He loves all kinds of animals. Take this. For your son's birthday. What's that?/ It's Marmot Rambo. Can it really shoot?/ Maybe if trained by the military. The military can train anything. Are these fingers or toes? They're so big. How much should I pay?/ For you, no charge. That's too expensive!/ You don't have to pay. Why didn't you say it's free? You should've told me. Thank you. You're welcome. So, will you take us? No! I'm picking up my son from school. How about we rent your bemo, and you can go home with your son. You want to celebrate with his birthday, right? How should I go home without my bemo? Don't worry. I'm going to leave my bike with you as collateral. But the registration is dead and the police has it now. Rest in peace./ Here's the ticket. If you need me, my address is written on the ticket. See? Easy, right?/ Alright. But you have to return my bemo before dark. Before dark, okay./ I have to drive it tomorrow. Okay. We're going to go./ Okay. Where's the keyhole? Hey! How do I start this? You drive away so easy. Throw your ex in the right place! When it starts to flood, turn our prayers to the Lord. Ndro! Mr. Al, you startled me. We're not in bemo anymore, no need to shout. What? Seblak?/ No need to shout! You're crazy, Ndro! Since I got out of that bemo, I can't hear anything. That's how people feel the first time they ride bemo. Me too. First time driving a bemo, my leg is killing me. I wonder how that hawker feels. I drove a bemo one time, and I'm complaining. And look at him./ I know. There are people who have to work hard for a living on Earth. For today's legislative session, I would like to thank all of you... ...for all of your hard work. Well, you know. Let's get some fresh air. Honey./ Yes, Dear? This is a starfruit. Do you know the benefit of starfruit?/ Tell me. It's to lower your high blood pressure. You know how you always get angry? You should eat this fruit. Seeing you angry makes me feel sorry for you. I know that sometimes I easily get angry. You're right. Ma'am, how much is the starfruit for one kilogram? It's 25.000 rupiah per kilogram. It's 25.000 rupiah per kilogram, Honey. 25.000 rupiah per kilogram? From a street vendor? Hello. That's too expensive. Honey, ask for a discount./ Isn't that too expensive, Ma'am? You're selling on the street. 25.000 rupiah is too expensive. How about 10.000 rupiah?/ I'm sorry, I can't. Is she having a star syndrome? A street vendor who doesn't want to negotiate. Honey, starfruits sold by a person with star syndrome. No way... You're so arrogant. You're a street vendor but your price is so expensive. And you won't negotiate? I'd rather go to a supermarket. They have AC, fresher fruits, tastier. Yes, supermarket is better./ I know, right? Then, why haggle here? You're beyond arrogant. You're a street vendor, don't be so arrogant. I'm a customer, and customers are kings. I can buy it all plus the cart, and I'll turn it upside down. And if needed, I'll buy the road too... ...to ban you from selling here again. You're so arrogant./ Put the starfruit back. Take it. I don't want it. It chooses to go with me. No way. I'd rather go to the supermarket. Why did it turn out like that, Ndro? That's how life on Earth is like. You'd ask a crazy discount from a street vendor. While in pricey supermarkets, no one haggles for discounts. Nobody dares. I know it's not fair, Mr. Al. Want to buy fruits, Sir?/ Yes. I'll buy all the starfruits. Sure./ Can I? Of course. All of them, Sir?/ Yes, I'll buy all of them. I didn't know you were so kind, Mr. Al. What's wrong? I'm touched./ By my story? I'm touched... ...by my own patience to keep listening to your absurd story. It's hard talking to Moms./ What do you mean by that? Alright, Honey. Be quiet for a bit, okay? Ma'am, one kg of starfruit. Hurry up and wrap them. They're sold out. That man bought them all. How could he! You tell them. Hey, how high is your blood pressure that you had to buy all the starfruit? But you said you're too posh to buy fruit from a street vendor. The supermarket sold out all their starfruits. I'd buy them all if they had them. If you really need them, take them. You don't have to haggle, because they're free. What? Free? Honey, the word "free" is foreign to our family. You're right, Honey./ The word "free" is insulting. They think I'm unemployed and I couldn't provide for you. Hey, are you insulting my husband? Do you think he's unemployed and can't buy me starfruits? Don't give us free stuff! Just take them if you want. Else, they'll be a waste. A waste, he said? That means, he's giving us leftovers. They'll eat it first, and when they can't finish... ...we're given what's left. It's secondhand food. Both of you are really testing my patience. You have the nerve giving us used food? You dare giving us waste? This is unacceptable. You dare oppose me?/ Honey. Yeah?/ Show them your weapon. Show them you graduated from a brawling school. Great idea. I'll show them. Hold my purse, Dear. Watch where you stand. I don't want to accidentally hurt you. Come forward. Do you think I'm scared of you? Come forward!/ Attack! Retreat. Attack!/ You dare oppose me? Retreat. Attack again, Honey./ How dare you! Retreat, Honey./ You dare oppose me? Attack./ Ganging up on me? Come here! Fight me one on one!/ Honey. Mr. Al, I forgot to tell you one thing about Earth. Honey./ What is it, Dear? Don't ever fight a lady. Especially when they're having their monthly visit. What? People of the moon is visiting Earth? What? I'm talking about that lady! Don't hold your weapon like that. So how should I do it, Dear?/ Swing it over your head. So that they'll be more intimidated?/ That's right. Let's go./ To where, Mr. Al? We're going to disappear. They ran away! They're afraid. And I haven't even done anything. It's a good thing I'm a sweet woman./ That's right. I don't get angry or upset easily. Or this gear would have flown!/ Honey. They left the starfruits./ It'll be a waste to leave them. Walk slowly and pay attention to your surroundings. Wasting is copying the devil./ Three, two, one... Free stuff./ Two bags of them. No need to haggle. So, we need the fruit after all. Drive, Sir! Let's go. Hurry up! Don't just stare at us. Drive!/ Where do you want to go? We're looking for a place to eat./ Lots of places to eat in Jakarta. Which one do you want? I'll let you choose, then. What do you want to eat, Boss? He doesn't know anything. Soto Betawi. I've done some research before I came here. The food that I must try in Jakarta is Soto Betawi. I know a great place for that./ Great. What the... What is wrong with you? You startled me. You said you were driving a bemo, and now you're riding a taxi. Your story is inconsistent. Oh no! Oh my God! The bemo!/ Oh my God! Oh my God? Can you drive us back to the City Park? Are you sure? We're so close to the restaurant. You're right. Are you hungry? Alhamdulillah. I haven't eaten since morning. I'm not asking you. I'm asking my friend here. Are you hungry, Mr. Al? All right. We'll eat first./ Right, Sir. You can park the taxi when we get there. Park the taxi?/ Yeah, you're eating with us. You can't do that. That's unethical. A taxi driver can't eat with the passenger. Do you want to eat with us or not?/ Of course I do. Tonight's party's still on, right? Of course. I brought my party dress. Look. But we're not going to drink, right?/ No. Let's go./ Okay. Let's go. You're not a local. Behave yourself. You're just a migrant, but you're acting all superior. Don't try to win over the boss. Of course the boss favor me, I work harder than you. Are you saying that I'm lazy? It's normal. Some people just dislike outsiders. Even if they are just from the neighboring area. Blowing matters up over trivial things. Take a look at them. Alex, Albert, Asep. They're all lazy. Why aren't you? But he's diligent./ Who? Hey, where are you going? Welcome, Sir. Excuse me, here are the menus. Call me if you're ready to order. I have a story. It's about Mrs. Siti. Do you know her? Mrs. Siti.../ We are related. Hold on. I've never known that you have a family member called Mrs. Siti. I don't? Oh, she's related to Asrul. Asrul, my junior high friend. Asrul?/ Yeah. He's a Sundanese who lived in Jogja... ...and studied in the US. Never mind that. We're all brothers and sisters after all. I'm tired of listening to your story. I was about to tell you how Mr. Al was offered a job as an actor. An alien becoming an actor? Yeah. I was going to tell you about how he was offered the job. But you're tired, so.../ Can you tell me just that part? That's not how it works. It's connected to the whole story. But if you're tired of hearing it.../ No, I take that back. Ndro, tell me about how the alien become an actor! Enjoy your meal. Call me if you need anything else./ Thank you. Oh my God. Are you asking for trouble? I'm not. I've been avoiding you all day. What's your problem?/ You want to fight? Up to you. Whatever, let's go. Calm down. What's going on here? Brothers are not suppose to fight. We're not brothers. I'd rather go to hell than be his brother. Okay. Maybe you're not really brothers. But I bet you have some things in common. Such as?/ Do you know Mrs. Siti? I know her./ I don't. Mrs. Maria? Mrs. Layla? Mr. Marcus? Mrs. Susi? I know her. She's my neighbor in Cilincing. I bet you don't know her./ I know her. Who are you talking about? She's our Minister of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries./ Sink it! I know Mrs. Susi, our Minister of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. There, you both know a person named Mrs. Susi. That settles it. That's not how it works. There are a lot of people that are named Mrs. Susi. But out of all the people in the world... ...both of you know which one is your Mrs. Susi, right? Here's another example. You both like agate ring. I know it. In my planet we call them natural stone. We wear them as jewelry. My father usually rubs the ring. Where can I buy that? I want to bring some home. For my father./ The agate stone? Lots in Gang Kembang, the store at the end. His name is Mr. Slamet, right? I bought this from him too. Another thing you have in common. You both know a person named Mr. Slamet, right? That settles it. No need to fight. Another thing you have in common. Do you want to know what? No, thanks. You're giving me headache. Don't compare me with him. You're giving me headache. I don't want anything in common with him. Especially me. I never want to be the same as him, ever. Excuse me. Ndro, when can we go to that place? We can. But we have to get the bemo first. Okay! Indro! Want one? No, thank you. He's my friend from the countryside. This is his first time visiting the capital city. No wonder. That alien is amazing. He understand about the agate ring. I don't know if he understand about the stone. All I know is that he bought them for his father. The person who understand about agate stone is Mr. Slamet. Who is Mr. Slamet? He's this person. Let me introduce myself, my name is Indro. Slamet. Yes. Your friend seems to know much about agate. Is he a rich collector?/ I don't know about that. But maybe he wants to open a gemstone store someday. That's a gem dream. What do you mean by gem?/ Agate is a gemstone. Get it? Yes./ Am I right? Buy some too, Sir. Save yourselves! Why not save yourself too?/ Because my name is Slamet (Safe) Asep, where are you? You said you're coming around to pick me up. You said that hours ago. Come here quick. I want to leave here now. Do you want me to fire you? Ndro, let's go to another place./ Where to, Mr. Al? Hey, Mister. Did you see a clown, just there? What clown? Are you crazy? You're crazy!/ No, you are! You're crazy!/ No, you are! You're crazy!/ No, you are! You're crazy!/ No, you are! You're crazy!/ No, you are! You're crazy!/ No, you are! You're crazy! You're crazy! Hey! You're crazy!/ No, you are! You're crazy!/ No, you are! You're crazy!/ I'll slap you. You're crazy! I don't want to fall behind our schedule. We must begin the shoot right now. Why does she refuse to come? She's sulking, Sir./ Why? She asked for warm milk, but given hot milk instead. Of course, nobody wants to drink hot milk. At least she could wait until the milk was warm enough to drink. Why didn't she just wait? Tell Mira to get ready. She's sexy, right? She also said no. She swore never to do any movie with us ever again. Why? Is that because of me? She hates me? You can't tell anybody about it./ No, it's not because of you. She doesn't want to because the shoot takes the whole day. She has a store.../ Lower your voice. If everyone hears, no one will want to work with me. Filming is a long process, it's like that everywhere. Did I say that out loud? Mr. Al, where are we? You just disappear at random. We were being chased. So I teleported us randomly. But you're amazing. With power to teleport. So did you teleport here from your planet? Not really. The teleportation process has a certain range. I came here in a spaceship. Where did you park the spaceship? Oom, telolet, Oom! Parkir Timur! You know Parkir Timur! What's wrong? What's that? A demon? A ghost? A monster? Or maybe it's an alien? Mr. Al, you are the alien. I forgot. That's a ghost! That's not a ghost. That's a cat./ Ghost! But we call them ghost in my planet. They're evil creatures. They eat aliens. Are aliens like salted fish?/ Run! Mr. Al. Do you have any idea how to solve this situation? What are we going to do with this movie? A movie festival? What is this place, Ndro? I don't know either. But I think it's a filming set. Mr. Al is the Alien King. He didn't come here to be filmed. Exactly. In this movie, we want to show the people... ...that aliens are a part of our universe. She's right./ What's the alien role in the movie? It's like this, this movie title is The Last Kiss. So it's about the kiss between a human and an alien... ...in order to end their conflict and to create peace in the universe. And all of it's inhabitants. I'll let him decide. Because it's about creating peace in the universe... ...I want to be in your movie. Yes! Mr. Director./ Yes, Dolphin. Why did you dress him like that? Isn't he supposed to replace Diana? He's not! Clean his makeup! Go back inside. And action! Cut! Cut! Cut! Which one is the alien again? Hold on. What? Sorry. He's the one playing the alien here. Not me? He's the alien?/ I'm sorry. Why didn't you tell me?/ I'm sorry. Did you talk to him?/ I did. Ready? Camera! Sound! And action! Cut! Nice. Next shot. It was wonderful! Your acting skills are amazing! Right. Now, call Rada. We're going to do the reverse shot. It's Rada's turn now. Rada?/ Yes. Where's Rada? Rada's gone. Good job! You're amazing, Mr. Al. Hold on./ Now what? About the alien that turned into an actor. Is that the end of his career? There's nothing he can do, considering the other actor ran away. Maybe he was traumatized. That's disappointing. I'm going to sleep. I'm not finished! Now what?/ I'm almost done. Let me finish. Finish doing what?/ Telling my story! What else? Your acting was great. Are you a movie star in your planet? No, I'm not. Get Mr. Al./ Yes, Sir. Wait, Mr. Al! Put a mirror.../ He's gone! Gone? Who's gone? The alien is gone. Mr. Al's gone? So we've lost Diana, Mira, Rada and now Mr. Al too? They're all gone? This will send my career back to making wedding videos. Where are we, Ndro? We're in a cemetery. Why did you teleport us here? Why not to Dufan, or a disco, or Monas. Where people are. Why did you have to teleport us into a cemetery? That ghost eats aliens. Do you want me to get killed? Let's rest here for a while. Come to think of it, it's most peaceful in the cemetery. We've never heard about quarreling dead bodies. Or dead bodies involved in a brawl. You're right. Seems the most peaceful place is the cemetery. I've changed my mind. The kind of peace that you'll find in the cemetery is only for the deceased. But I don't think I share that peaceful feeling. Let's get out of here. Do you feel the air is heavy back there? What? Astaghfirullahaladzim. Stop! I don't want to hear anything about a pocong. Are you sure? Stop! Stop! I don't want to hear about it! You know I don't like horror stories. You can tell me any kind of story except horror. Okay, we'll skip the pocong part. Good./ Okay. Long story short, I got away from the pocong. Mr. Al was behind me. And from the cemetery, we went to get the bemo. Then we went to Sumber Damai. It's so comfortable. You know what, Mr. Al? I always come here after a long day in the office. It's refreshing. Have we met before? You were the waiter at the restaurant./ Yeah, that was me. What are you doing here?/ I work as a waiter until the afternoon. I work 2 shifts. The restaurant at noon and here at night. You're an amazing hard worker. Which one is your big toe? This one. Look. This one. You have giant big toes, I thought they were your calves. Since your feet are so big... ...can you give me a big tip? Okay. Who's going to massage my feet? I'm sorry, I have to work alone tonight. My workmate just quit recently. But there's a new worker. Maybe he will be here soon. What time do you close? It's almost time. We closed at 12 AM. What? It's almost 12 AM? My wife is going to kill me. Don't worry about it. Finish the massage. It's almost done anyway. Assalamu'alaykum./ Wa'alaykumussalam. Oh my God. It's you again. What have I done to deserve this? Do you know what else you have in common? Both of you are hard workers. I think I should step down as the king of my planet. Because even now, I still can't find peace. Let alone bring it home to our people. In my opinion, Mr. Al. You can't search for peace. Peace must be created. How can I create peace on such a big planet like mine? I think you could learn from your experience today. How you landed on earth. You've talked to its inhabitants. You've heard their life stories. You saw their struggles. Maybe you can share what you've learned to your people. Thanks, Ndro. I've learned so much from your planet. Once I return to my planet... ...I'm going to 'blusukan' (impromptu visits). He knows 'blusukan'. And that's the end of my story. Your story is full of morals. And you expect me to believe it? Just admit it. Don't use an alien for your excuses. Where have you been all day and night? All right. I'll finish it quickly. I was with Dono and Kasino. We talked in a coffee shop. Criticizing everybody. Just voicing the small people, we don't mean to be nosy. Did you really hang with Dono and Kasino only? I swear./ See, it's not difficult, isn't it? You don't need to beat around the bush. I don't mind if you want to hang out with your friends. As long as you let me know and not leave your phone at home. That's all I ask./ Alright. Stop being mad at me. I'm not mad at you. I was just worried. I'm happy to see you home safe and sound. Let's sleep. Wake up, Ndro. What is it, Nita? Someone's knocking at our door. Knocking door this late. It must be burglars. Burglars don't knock on your door. Can you please check it anyway? Nita. What are you going to do with that brush? This is all I can find. Are you planning to brush the burglar's hair to death? Hold on. I'll electrocute him./ Nita! Let's go. Who is it, Ndro? I'm scared. I'm scared! I don't want to see!/ What's wrong with you? That's Mr. Al. The alien from my story. Sorry to bother you this late. Ndro, I'm in big trouble for coming home late. Can you explain to my wife? That's her right there. It's an honor to be visited by a queen from Planet Aliando. It's Planet Alianus./ Yeah, that's what I meant. It's my husband's habit. He always comes home late. Really?/ Yeah. He never tells me if he's going to come home late either. Actually this is the first time Indro came home late. Don't let him make it a habit./ I won't. They make us worry, right? Yeah. I was worried. When he still wasn't home, I was so worried. I thought he was kidnapped, tied down, tortured, or mutilated. Or beheaded, or drowned into the river in cement shoes. And never resurfaced. It's horrible, right? If you didn't explain to my wife why I came home late at night... ...that's what she'll do to me. Beheaded, or drowned into the river in cement shoes. Your typical modern wife, right? You're not only right! Very! Your knowledge of slang words is amazing. Sright. Cray. Alright then, Sista. It's late, we'd better leave. Hold on. I want to give you my homemade jengkol crackers. It smells wonderful. If you like it, you can order more from me. I'm selling them online, on Instagram too. I've put my account on the label./ I see. But how do I deliver them to you? I have a courier company. I can send one of my couriers here to pick them up. What if we become partners? What do you mean? If you have celebs friends in your planet. I'd like them to endorse my product. I want my jengkol crackers to be more famous. More famous than the 'in' cakes of the celebs here. I have lots of celebs friends back in my planet. That's perfect! Text me./ Will do! Deal?/ Deal! Bye! Be careful./ Come visit us again! Pull over if you're sleepy! Now, do you believe me? I wasn't lying. If you believe my first story, I wouldn't have to lie about... ...hanging out with Dono and Kasino. You're still wrong. Leaving and coming home late without telling me. And you left your phone at home. She still won't admit she's wrong. Mr. Indro is a strong man. His wife is very controlling. And you're not? So, that's what you think? You can sleep outside tonight. It's your fault! I dropped the crackers! You can always order more. I'm Al. Aliando. Our names are almost identical, except for the -do. Are you Vanesha?/ Yes. My prediction is that... We'll be meeting each other at the canteen? I've already received that prediction from the owner of this bike. Even aliens give massages too now? And familiar with slang words too?/ Cray! Cray alien! I'm Mr. Spock./ I'm Mr. Alien. I'm Mr. Spock. You're crazy, Jef!/ You're crazy, Ndro!
