Prefiltered violence, fear eats the soul. Jacket metal bad life, fear eats the soul. I'm a-- A disease. Parasites, parasites, parasites, parasites. I just hope these fucking showers are working this time, eh? Not gonna get any shares with your enemy, you cunt. Make that some, eh? He's a light bulb. I'll tell you what, Boab, we'll put you in the showers without wee team. I mean, there's little chance of you catching it in our front. You'd never get near on my last team. Well, I'll sort him on this team here. Make sure you do, bud. Hurt 'em. Hurt 'em hard. That's the only way you'll stop that cunt, eh? Hey, it's only a fucking game. If anybody breaks any guys legs, he-- Have him fucking hard, Boab, doesn't he? Aye, he's right. Good. Tambo, he's a ball man. Right, come on, boys. Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Come on, let's go! Let's get to it! Fuck! Fuck. All right. Fucking rats! Play the fucking game. Play the fucking game! Come on, Paulie. Come on! Come on! Ollie, how you doing? Two pints, please. How'd it go? Necked it, 2-1. And yours truly played in the captain's part, in knocking him the win. We were a wee bit scabby, as the truth be told, but these mugs never made the best of the possession. You can have all the possession in the world, mate, but if you can't even make it count, eh? Still had something of a run, though? Aye. We're hoping for a promotion in going all the way at the Tom Logan Memorial Trophy. Just to get the full treatment at the park, with the nets, and all that stuff. The real fucking game, you kin? I mean, these cunts were disputing the first ball, eh? Aye. It's not the same as with the nets, eh? See, the ball goes at back of the net. That's the essence of the game. That's when you're playing real football, not just having a cock-about. Hey, just a fresh orange lemonade for me, pop. Of course, Tom. We have to affect the necessary personnel changes to ensure we make the progress required by the Granton Star Football Club AFC. So you're gonna tell Boab Coyle he's dropped, then? Look, I'll tell him, Tambo. I'll tell him. I'm the captain. Mates are me mates. The Granton Star, course, has to come first, eh? Boab'll understand it. Oh, aye. Yeah! Listen, mate, this isn't real easy to see. It's just that we all agree we gotta guarantee our game, innit? Eh? You see, it's all but. Well, I've got Tambo and Grant in it. This team's going places, man. Going places? Going places? And three. It's a cock-about, you pretentious cunt! A fucking cock-about! Well, you're right to be disappointed, mate. Disappointed? Too fucking right I'm disappointed! Which cunt washes his threads nearly every week, then, eh? Don't be like that, man. Have another pint, eh? Stick your fucking pint up your ass! Some mates you's is! Well, fuck you! If you take it up, I could break it up. We could say something new. Fucking orange juice drinking cunt, Tambo. He's only just joined the fucking club. Fresh orange and lemonade. Fresh orange and lemonade. I'll show these cunts. I'll get another club. No fucking bother at all. , Then. A real one. If anyone is to be fucking blamed-- fucking bastards. That's it, now, doll. Yeah. Have a look at that. That'll be him, then? Aye. I'll tell him. I'll tell him. All right, son. Wanting a word with ya. Oh, aye. It's no way-- like, say, we're trying to get rid of ya, son. That's enough, Doreen. Let me speak to the lad. Look, what's on for supper, eh? The thing, son-- staying here with us is-- you're 23 years old now, which is far too old for a laddy to be staying with his ma and father. I mean, I was away at sea with the merchant navy at 17. 17, boy. I mean, you don't want your mates to think you're some sort of queer fella, now, do ya? Anyway, your ma and me's not getting any younger. We're entering a funny phrase in our lives. Some might even say a dangerous phase. Your ma and me, son, we need time, you know? We need time, sorting our lives. Time. You've got a lassie, yeah, but you cannot score. Your problem is-- No, but-- It wasn't meant to be like this, Bob. It's not like nothing, no, Doreen. There isn't any hassle. Just father to son talk. All I'm saying, laddy-- all I'm saying here, Boab, is you're having your cake and eating it. And we pay-- ha. I'll tell ya, we're muggers here. Your ma and me. Now, I know it's not easy to find somewhere to stay these days, but your ma and me, we're prepared to give you two weeks' grace. Just as long as you're out of here within a fortnight. End of story. Aye. Right. It's not like we're trying to get rid of you, son. It's just that-- eh-- your father and me think it would be mutually advantageous to both parties if you, like, found your own place. That's it. Mutually advantageous to both pairs. Right. Don't go now, son. Sit down and watch a bit of the telly. Doreen, let the laddy go out. He'll want to be with his mates, or with Evelyn. He's not going to stay and watch the television with us. We're just here playing with our new toys. Aye. See ya, then. Evelyn. Thank fuck for you, hon. Maybe we should get a place together? Eve'll be in right now. Get on right, Evelyn, eh? Wake up to a blowjob every morning. Get me strips washed when I've got another club. Eve. Boab, all right? Aye. You fancy coming out? No. Why no? I just dunno. Aw, but why not? I just don't. Well, Eve, I've had a bad day. I need to talk to you. Aye, well talk to your mates. Don't be like that, Eve. I says I've had a bad day. Oh, what is it? What have I done? You've. Eve? It's not what you've done, it's what you've not done. But Eve-- Me and you Boab-- I want a guy who can do things for us. Somebody who can really make love to a woman. Not just some fat bastard who sits on his ass talking about the football, and drinking pints of lager with his mates. A real man, Boab. A sexy man. I am 20, Boab. 20 years old, and I'm not going to tie myself down to a slob. What's got into you? Hey, Evelyn, you and me-- you were just a daff wee lassy before you met me. You never knew, for fuck's sake. Oh, well that's all changed. Because I've met somebody, Boab. More of a fucking man than you'll ever be. Eh? Hey! Where is that cunt? That's for me to know, and you to find out. But Evelyn, how could you do this to us? You and me, Eve, it was always you and me. Engagement, and that. I'm sorry, Boab. But I've known you ever since I was 16. And I didn't know about love then, but I sure as fuck do now. You fucking slag. You horrible fucking hag! That's us finished, Boab. So who are you seeing? We are finished. Finito. Kaput. End of story. Goodnight, Vienna. Fuck. But Eve-- Eve, I loves you. You slut! Fucking slut! Fucking-- fucking-- fucking-- Our time is done, my love. We've laid it all to waste. 1,000 moons, the kisses caved. Sweet in this bitter taste. My desire for you is endless, and I'll love ya till we fall. I just don't want you no more. And then it's the sweetest embrace of all. So what's all been happening tonight, Brian? Well, there's the rapist, the guy who stabbed the boy in the shopping center, and this comedian in here. Well, I've had a wee word with your rapist. Seems a nice enough wee fella. Tells us the whore was asking for it, eh? That's the way of the world. As for the guy that stabbed the boy-- well, silly wee bugger, but, uh-- Boys will be boys. And what's the story with this tube steak? Caught him smashing up a telephone box. I want a wee word with you, cunt. So lay your weapons down. They said, no purpose in your hands. Come on. Come on. Get up. Come on. You kids. It just goes to show ya the effect of the privatization policies. Heh, heh, heh. As a BT shareholder, I feel I've got me at stake now, and I do not want some lumpin' proletarian malcontent threatening my investment. Yeah? Bastard. Michael O'Neill gushed in through the left. That's the action. He likes that, man. Must have bashed them on a real bullet. You should have been there, man. I'd not fucking win, like. Already went, eh? We had a game on, like, 1-2-1. I was up against this nappy wee wanger-- Fucking tube. Rafferty wants a word. Rafferty? Aye. Did he say what it was about, like? Like fuck. That cunt's not likely to tell the likes of me fuck all, is he? Fucking cunt. There's no more fucking work to do. Mr. Rafferty? Sit down, Boab. I'll come straight to the point, now. It's all about price these days, Boab. Bloody cowboys with their fewer overheads, lower costs. They're criminals, Boab. What are you trying to say? I've got to cut costs. Where can I cut costs? It cannot be capital cost, Boab. It's got to be labor. It's all down to market positioning, Boab. Well, I've got to find a niche in the market, and that niche is as a quality firm specializing in local moves for the A, B's, and C's. So I'm sacked, then? No, no, no, no. It's your post that's been made redunant, Boab. It's important to remember there's no other person to make redundant, it's the post. You're going to have to-- Into another tragedy. You also need to lose-- A man who dares. Welcome to our unhappy home. But I can't help you now. No one can help you now. This is the saddest thing I have ever heard. How did you manage to do such a stupid thing? Such a stupid thing. Such a stupid thing. You fucked this one up, you daft cunt. Eh? What? You. Boab Coyle. No house, no job, no bud, no mates, police record. On this space of yours. Nice one. Why the fuck do you get in my business, eh? What the fuck's it got to do with you, eh? It's my fucking business to know. I'm God. What the fuck, you old lad? Fucking hell. Another wise cunt. Robert Anthony Coyle, born on Friday, the 23rd of July to Robert McNamara Coyle and Doreen Sharpe. Younger brother of Kathleen Juon Shawl, who's married to James Allen Shaw. They live at 21 Parkland Crescent in Dumbarton, and they have a kid who is also called James. You have a crescent shaped birthmark on your inner thigh. Until recently you were working at Furniture Removals, lived at home, had a bud called Evelyn whom you couldn't sexually satisfy, and played football for Granton Star, like you made love-- employing little effort, and even less skill. If you're God, what are you doing sitting here wasting time on the likes of me, eh? Good question, Boab. Good question. I mean, there's been starting late, see-- on the telly, now. If you were that good, you could sort all that out, instead of sitting here bevvying with the likes of me, eh? Hold on a minute, pal. Let's get one thing straight-- every fucking time I come down here, so wino pulses up a bit what I should and shouldn't be fucking doing. Either that, or I have to enter into some philosophical discourse with some wee undergraduate twat about the nature of myself. The extent of my omnipotence, and all that shit. I'm getting a wee bit fed up with all the self-justification. It's not for youse cunts to criticize me. I give youse the place. I made you cunts in my own image. Youse get on with it. Youse fucking well sort it out. And that cunt Nietzsche was way off the mark when he said that I was dead. I'm not dead. I just don't even give a fuck. Well, you're a fucking toss. See, if I had your fucking powers-- If you had my powers, you'd do what you do you right now. Sweet fuck all. Look, you've got the power to cut down on the pints of lager, right? Aye, but-- No buts about it. You've got the power to get fit, and make a mere positive contribution to the Granton Star cause. You had the power to may more attention to that wee bud of yours. Brr. She was tidy. You could have done a lot better there, bub. Well, maybe I could, and maybe I couldn't. What the fuck's it got to do with you, eh? You had the power get out from under your ma and dad's feet, so's they could get a decent coping peace, but no. Not selfish cunt Coyle. Just sits there watching "Coronation Street" and "Brookside" while those poor cunts have gone up the walls with frustration. It's none of your business. Everything's my business. That cunt Rafferty. You didn't even tell the cunt to stick his fucking job up his ass. So what? So fucking what? Eh? So you had the powers. You just couldn't even be bothered using them. That's why you interest me, Boab. You're just like me-- a lazy, apathetic, slovenly cunt. Now, I hate being like this. But being immortal, I can't even punish myself. I can punish you, though, mate. And that's just what I intend to do. But I-- Shut it, cunt. I've fucking had it up to the eyeballs with all this repentance shite. Vengeance is mine, and I intend to take it, on my own lazy and selfish nature. On the species that I created, on their representative. That's you. You just look like I always imagined. That's because you've no imagination, you daft cunt. You see me, and you hear me as you imagine me. Now, you fucking. But I'm not the worst. What about the murderers, serial killers, dictators, torturers, politicians-- cunts that shut down factories to preserve the profit levels. Or the greedy, rich bastards. What about them, eh? Might get rid of them cunts. Might not. That's my fucking business. You're a claim cunt. You're a piece of slime cunt. An insect. That's it. An insect. I'm going to make you look like the dirty, lazy paste that you are. I'm over here. Some fucking day, this. Boab? Boab? Look, Boab, sorry about the other day, mate. Hey. I don't give a fuck about the other day. I played football, caught up with the Star. For the fucking. And I've just met God. Cunt's got. Aye, you're right. I suppose it will be easier than telling you you're not a football player, eh? I'm not fucking joking, man. You didn't huff up some shite, Boab? That's it. An insect. I'm going to make you look like the dirty, lazy paste that you are. Ignition. Lift off. Summer wind came blowing in from across the sea. It lingered there to touch your hair, and walk with me. Oh, summer love, we sang a song, then we strolled that golden sand. Two sweethearts in the summer wind. Like painted kites-- Boab? Is that really you? Fucking hell. That, uh-- what's his name? That God did this to you, mate? What the fuck are you going to do, man? Oh, sorry, Boab. Sorry. Well, this isn't even fucking real, man. Listen, mate, you're welcome to stay here, but keep out of Jilly's way, OK? Cause she hates flies. Stay behind the curtains in the spare bedroom, right? And no sneaking in to spy on us when we're on the job, you dirty cunt. Right. Keep fucking me, Tambo! Oh, yeah! Oh, fucking hell! I love a good fuck! Aw, yeah! Oh, yeah. The. Aw, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, right, it'll be quick. Ah-- fuck! Keep fucking me, Tambo! Huh? Ah! Fucking-- Come here. Are you only fucking real, eh? Must have fucking red raw balls here. So, you had the powers. He just couldn't even be bothered using them. You had to power to pay more attention to that wee bud of yours. She was tidy. Oh, yes, Mr. Monroe. That cunt Rafferty. You didn't even tell the cunt to stick his fucking job up his ass. You're just like me. A dirty, lazy, slovenly cunt. You had the power to get out from under your ma and dad's feet, so's they could have a decent coping peace. But no. You're selfish cunt Coyle. That'll do. Keep pushing. I can take more. I need more. Hurry it. Firmly. Sheila. We're nearly up to the hilt already. I don't know if you're man enough, Boab Coyle. Stanton. Black. Tell us where it is. Tell us, you fucking philandering bastard! I'll never talk. Edwards. Luke. Gordon. Crumley. Well, are you all right, bub? Major ass man now. Give me the pain, Doreen. Tell, us, bub. Tell us who you've been seeing. Dolly Parton. What? I can't hear ya. Dolly Parton! That fucking slut? I knew it. Who else? On the fourth. Not Madonna, but just the once. Scumbag. Bastard. You dirty fucking prick! You keen what this means, bub? No. No, Doreen. No! Not the shite, Doreen. No-- Not the shite. Oh, god! Oh, god, I hate the shite. I'm going to shake your moose bob, Coyle. That's what we both want. Don't even deny it. No! Don't-- oh, no! Oh, shite. Shite! Shame on both! Shite. That bloody fly. But you I'll need to get that, Boab. That'll be Kathy. She'll pester us all night if I don't answer it now. Don't you go away. Oh Doreen. Hi-ya, Kathy. How you doing, love? Oh, good. Good. Oh, just fine. Oh, just the usual. Uh-- you keen? Uh-huh. Oh-- your dad's fine. Aye. How's the wee fella? Aw, the wee lamb. And Jimmy? Oh, good. Good. Hey, listen, love, we're just sitting down to a tea, so, eh, I'll phone you back in about half an hour, and we can have a proper play, then, right? Aye. OK, love. Aye. Right you are, then. See you about an hour. Cheerio. Bloody fly! Got ya, ya swine. Nice one, Doreen. That fly was a bag of piss, and you bopped him. , Doreen. The nipples. Right. But by the time I get to Phoenix, she'll be rising. And she'll find that note that I left hanging on the door. And she'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leaving. Cause I've left that girl so many times before. And by the time I get to Albuquerque, she'll be working. And she'll take off time just to give me-- That's life. And I can't deny it. Many times I've thought of quittin'. But my heart won't buy it. But if there's not a-- I'm going to roll myself up in a big bowl, and die. Put your name up, mate. Right. Well, I may just do that. You're playing the bandit, then, Johnny? Aye. Looks like it, huh? You'll get the money to get us a drink? I see you're, uh, in the family way, then eh? Good to know that. So then we'll lose? Hey, mate? You're on, eh? All right. Good evening, folks. May I ask the bride and groom to come out and join us for their first dance. Ladies and gentlemen, your bride and groom. I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now. Back beat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out. I'm sure you've heard it all before, but you never even had a doubt. I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now. All the-- It's a good thing Johnny's been huckled. Who's that? Keeps the fucking CSE off your back. You're a nut. When was that? That's Sonia. I was with Sonia. Swapped 'em out. Naw, you're fucking assin', man. See, that. She was right in there for the fucking-- Hey, mate. Shut up. - Eh? - Just shut up. Eh? What did you just fucking say that, then? Hey, you. What did you just fucking say, then? I didn't say nothing, Alec. Didn't say fuck all, Alec. What? Just fucking pissed, eh? Eh? Just talking fucking shite with the boys. What? I was just saying-- ah! Eh? Just fucking saying, are ya? Eh? Well, I'm just fucking well saying this! Stop it! Stop it! And that! For fuck's sake! And this! Leave him alone! Eh? And this! Yep. That's what I'm just fucking saying. So, uh, what are you just fucking saying now, eh? Well done, son! This isn't a bad do, eh? That was so messy. A wedding needs a good, to-- to make it go off right. Yeah. Traditionally. Traditionally. Couldn't just leave it, Johnny? Eh? It was just all right, eh? John. There was no respect for you or my sister. You're family now. Any cunt that fucks with you fucks with me. Mind that. Any cunt that gets lucky with ya, just fucking ring back, eh? Yeah. Hey, there. Hey. Shh, shh, shh. Come on. There. Eh? Come on. All right, mate? Aye. You just moved into Mrs. Robinson's old house, huh? Lay off. What's it to you, like? I'm your neighbor, eh? I stay just below ya, eh? You want a hand there, huh? Cheers, mate. I'm Larry, by the way.

She's at your ma's. She's at my ma's? She's at my ma's. When are you going to fucking go down there and get her, then, eh? - Hey. Hey. That's not a crack you expect for your friends and neighbors, eh? We're at a fucking party. Gotta be social, eh? Gotta be social? She's the one who wants to be fucking social. Hey. Sit down, then. What? What? She's been sitting here all fucking day, on her fat ass. That's all you've been doing. But that fucking. Eh? Just left her there. Eh? Do you give a fuck? Do you give a flying fuck? Eh. Eh. Sorry? - Aye. - Oh, you do? Aye. Aye. Oh. Right. Right, well,. Ah, Tess. Right. What color clothes she wearing, there? Eh? What color clothes she wear? Do you think they fucking notice? Cerise.

So the doctor says to give up the cigarettes, John. I just turned around and said to him, take the fags away, you might as well put a plastic bag in my head, eh? Fags are the only thing that's keeping me going, eh? Well, that and making sure my laddy gets himself settled down properly. And no matter what I told him. I've come in person. Aye, aye, aye. All right. See, the thing is with you, John, you're a soft touch. People see that in you. Old sap Johnny. Man, they used to call you that at school. No, they didn't, all right? No they didn't. - I mind. I mind, all right. Weak, like your favor. Look, I'm not, all right? Well, that was the school. Oh, John, he was always good at the school. Not you, though, eh? Then came that whore. That was not a waste of time? - Aye. All right. Eh? But then came Chantal, eh? See, so it wasn't always that dire, right? Eh? See, if I hadn't have gotten together with Catriona, then we wouldn't have had her, eh? Aye. Little princess right there. Aye. You've gotta see her that way, right? Oh, well. Baby. It doesn't matter-- I end up calling-- Shh. Shh. Feeling all dread. At least when she's around, the troubles there, it's worse to wake up with her falling room the room. Listen, Johnny, you're like a mother to the girl you've fallen for. You're still falling. Listen, Johnny, you're like a mother to the girl you've fallen for. Never been humped like this before, have you, darling? Not so fucking hard like that. Fuck! Like fucking well. Aw, fuck. Just like fucking chocolate, eh? Well, Mom was right. She says I'm not family, and the fucking Doyles was rubbish, eh? Hey, Chantal. We are not up the shit, though, darling. Eh? Not us. Not us. That's him. That's him up there, huh? You're so fucking hard, like-- fuck. It's all right, doll. Push. You're all greased here, eh? We're broken here. I took away a. I can't leave anything here, though. Can't even show you the, eh?

Come here. Come here. It's OK. All right, mate. What's up? I need a wee favor, eh? These fucking electric cunts have gone and cut us off. That's me sorting it. I've got an extension block up the stairs, just for the power and electric fare, eh? That's a fucking hoot, man. That's my fucking electric. If you ever touch that fucking plug, or that fucking switch, Johnny, you're fucking dead. Fucking telling you. Listen, Johnny, you and me are still mates, huh? That's the way I see it. Forget any of this happened. To me, we're still mates, and that's that, eh? I mean, I'll go half with you on the bills, if that's what you're fucking worried about. What's that meant to mean, then? Eh? Better fucking not mean that. No bath radio, eh, John? I mean, don't have to move in here, mate, eh? Just wanted to hang. She was counting on it. All the way? Ever fucked up the ass? I started giving the message that way. I mean, I don't want her mistaking, you know? Fucking been daft, that cunt. I mean, what's she got, a slide up the stick, then they've got a hand in your pocket for the rest of your life? Not with my fucking shit, I'll tell you that front out. I'll keep my money. Tell you one thing, though, John. I hope you've not got that angel neck like that. Cause if you have, you'll give it to me by now. I never bob in. No fucking way. Rather have a fucking wank, man. No. Not going out like that. Just as well. You're a dirty, wee cunt. Tell you what else, John. It seems to me you've still got the bird, eh? She wants you back, you say no. Even though you can, and I fucking well can, and that bird belongs with this man. But no, I keep putting that daft cunt off, eh? Cause I'm than this. So it's thanks to me you've still got the bird, eh? Think about that the next time you start making accusations about other people, eh? Gonna have a mouth on her like her mom's, eh? Good for sucking on things. So it's off to the quarter finals, huh? Now, when. You've still got it, likes. We're all in, John. See, if you want to pork that again, just give us a shout, eh? I'll turn her to you. Chin up, likes. Does he know just where to touch you? Can he get you on your knees? That fucking smug-- Almost made me wish a-- a-- a disease-- I still love you. Good afternoon. Aw. Let's go. So I hear you, then. Johnny's, just cause it looks like you can't be on the pole. And I found out today that you've been shagging him behind my back, and we are still going out, but even still I'd wait for you. I'd wait for you. I'd still miss you. Fucking ass! Fucking-- Fuck you. You all right, Johnny? What do you want? Just to talk. Talk? Talk? What about? Not here, Johnny. Come on. All right, John. You took the piss, Johnny. No fucking cunt takes a piss with me. Ow! You fucking-- Fucking bloody the bastard! Fucking kill the fucking cunt! You fucking knob! He's stealing our fucking electricity! He's got my fucking baby! His fucking mother! Your ma! Fucking man! Ain't gonna. You can lick your fucking ma's puss, you fucking cunt! You fucking-- Where's the butter? No, no. I've got it. It's over here. Just-- Different versions of any man. Come before you can. Ha ha. Come here. Ah! Fucking check it out. I'm gonna get me a motorcar, maybe a Jaguar, maybe a. Gonna be a millionaire, some way to take me there, want to be wild, cause my life's OK. Hey! When I make love to your lassie, I never have a condom on me. That's me. What about you? Do you ever use a condom when you make love? Fuck you! And you can fuck out! Fucking slut! Fuck off! What the fuck are you all looking at, eh? What-- what-- Oh, fuck off, you fat cunt! Fuck that shite! Then eh? Listen, I wanna get my head done in a bit. Go with me? All right? Hey. So, where's Larry these days? Fuck knows? Staying with some fucking slut. Ah. It's not fucking like him, running off, eh? Soon as he found out I was pregnant, he just fucked off. Listen, Johnny, do you want to go out for a drink tonight? The Twin Lakes. Up the Bull and Bush? We were good together, Johnny. Everybody said so. We met the band out at the Bull and Bush, Johnny. Yeah. That was a good band, it was. Well, do you want to go out, Johnny? Come on. All right. You're still fallin'. Listen, Johnny, like a mother to the girl you've fallen for. You're still falling. And if they come tonight, you'll roll up tight, and take whatever's coming to you, boy. Fucking cut the beans. Kirsty? Kirsty! Susan was saying they were thinking of having a reception at the new function sweets that you so loved. I having it later. He'll want you to know. Aye, right? Resurrection bought the way. That was a cracker last night. Aye. They say they can have a party of up to 300 people there. I can get fucking 12,000 at Resurrection. Fucking Ingliston Showground. No, it was Mina and the Functions, sweets. It was. Oh, eh? Resurrection by the the fucking beats generated by the Shine was enough! But see, the Function-- Fucking-- The weddings, and that. You didn't even pay for the place. But you have to take their fee. You've got a choice spot. I'm getting me. I'm not getting all that fucking hardcore redneck shit. That's just for cunts, people like Cumbernold and Livingston. Places not fucking doing. I'm not gonna go for shit like that. Fucking shit, eh, boy? Fucking boy! Boy. It says at the. Must admit, Resurrection was a wee bit special, though. Aye. Wasn't it, though? Fucking well shuffling about now, though, eh? Eh? God, Jen, look at us. It's a pretty birdcase of sperm overdose. You know, I sometimes wish, looking back on that cold winter's evening, that I'd given Ian that blowjob instead. Hello. Hi, Rory. Hi. You all right, sweetie? One lump, or two? Heh, heh, heh. I'll see you later. I've just got to make a phone call. Call someone. How's Rory coping with all this? The same way Rory copes with everything. Makes all the correct noises, but doesn't actually do anything except stand around and irritate me. Wouldn't mind so much if he didn't profess to have a view on everything. Guys-- Boo! Mm! Aw, look at that wee soul. Shouldn't have babes in a fucking pub. I think it's nice. Means that people can't get hurt. They can get hurt easily whether they have fucking babes around. Can you handle that fucking shite? Wanting the milk. Oh, fuck. Whoa! Aw-- fucking hell! Well, if everybody was like that, there wouldn't be any human race. Fucking excuse me, you cunts. It's all fucked, anyway. I say, you live, you die, end of fucking story. Fucking having fucking babes around! Fucking skin puff! Keep your voice down, Coco. I'm not gonna keep my fucking voice down. Why the fuck should I, eh? Fucking, I tell ya, fucking straight peg shit. That's what this is all about, eh? Me and you getting fucking married. I'm not getting fucking married! But getting engaged. Skank whores! Fucking skank whore! Leanne, Leanne-- I'm Coco, you're Kirsty. Got that? Aye, but you couldn't call her a skank whore-- What did I fucking tell you? That is not fucking it! Fucking nosh, anyway. Listen, though, I fucking taste it, yeah? I've got the fucking nosh here. I just took the Super Mario in the back, and it's starting to kick in really good. Coco? Sorry. I can fucking handle my fucking drugs, eh? I mean, I've gotta get out in the flesh air. Hey. I'll get you down the road. I'll come over to yours in the morning, though. Eh? Raw fucking business fucking deal. Help! Fucking hell! Yes, I'm coming, Jen! I'm coming! My fucking waters have gone! Hurry up! Yes! Yes! Fucking hell! I'm coming! All right. We're on the way. It fucking hurts. Fucking dying here, Rory. Oh, darling, easy. Easy. We can get this clean. That's it. Breathe. Coco Brice! Brice! What are the odds, boys, of fucking top boy Coco fucking Brice? Oh, fucking hell! Oh, god! Grab her now! Breathe deep. Go ahead, love. Just keep breathing. We don't need the whole nitrous oxide thing. Push! It just makes the womb easy, it does nothing for babies. Just another example of patriarchal social control. Fucking Coco! Coco fucking Brice! Come on, then. No, we don't need that. We don't need that. We don't need that! Fucking business fucking deal. You hear me? Oh yes! Coco fucking Brice, you! Yeah, me and mine! Fucking Coco fucking Brice, eh? Fucking Coco fucking Brice! Fucking Coco! Coco fucking Brice! That's more fucking like it. Jen! Jen! That's more fucking like it. Coco fucking Brice! You hear me? What the fuck was that? Don't be afraid, son. Your mom would not let him hurt us again. Fucking regal. Fucking regal. Fucking regal. Fucking regal. Fucking-- Dad's coming back to us, Colin. Fucking regal. Dad's coming back to us. Dad's coming back. Fuck. Fuck. Fucking regal. I see 20 fucking regal. Dad's coming back to us, Colin. Yeah, you fucking well do, Colin. You cunt. Cunt! I see 20 fucking regal. Now move it! It'll be good for you, son. Your mom would not let him hurt us again. I wouldn't even let him back in the house unless he changed, son. The body of Christ. I'm in. Welcome to the family! Fucking come here, you fucking-- fucking-- you fucking ass! I'll fucking do that! Yeah! Hey! Fucking girl! Hey! Fucking girl! Welcome to the family. Move it. Kirsty. I don't love you. I don't even like you. I really like you, Kirsty. Aye. I really like you, and all. But I'm not really that good at talking like that. You came onto me, didn't ya? Huh? Eh? Aye. I love you, too. I love you, too. I love you, too. I love you, too. I love you, too. I love you, too. I love you, too. I love you, too. I love you, too. I love you, too. I love you, too. I love you, too. I love you, too. I love you, too. I love you, too. What? Who the fuck-- what? What? Push, hon! Push! What the fuck, mate? What-- It's coming! Oh, fuck! Sorry! Push! You've got to push! Push! Fucking-- Gonna be a fucking-- Jesus! Oh, dear. He's wonderful. Just support his head. Like that. See? Yeah. The waters are very muddy here. All right, Colin. Some fucking fucked up shit. What the fuck? Where am I? Eh? Mad fucking eyesight. Struck by lightning. On top of all this LSD friends he's taking. I'm very doubtful as to whether this is drug psychosis. If it is, it's the worst case I've ever seen. What the fuck's going on? He's a little darling. What are you? Mommy's little darling boy. You're not bad, eh? How is Thomas? How is little Tom Tom? Shut your fucking mouth, you specky git. Oh, this is-- oh-- what's this, here? Oh, you tubby cunt, you. You've got some pair of jugs, don't ya? Right enough, though. Whoa! I think he's trying to communicate with us. He's completely incapable of doing anything for himself, so when he needs food or the toilet, he just screams more. Yeah. Like a baby. Hungry today, aren't you? Mm. Best they fucking get. Really seems to be enjoying himself. Look at him. It's obscene. Shut up, you fucking specky cunt. I fucking told you, get the fuck. Jealous? Don't be silly. Jackpot. Well, I suppose I am. The books are right. The male parent feels excluded from the mother-baby bonding process. Maybe that's a good one to bring up at the men's group tonight. You don't mind me going, do you? Yeah,. No, no. You go if you want. Right, right, right. We'll amuse ourselves, hm? Whatever you say, doll. Get your gums on that. Coco's fucked. He's just lying there, grinning like a babe, eh? Aye, that's not Coco Brice lying there. All right, Coco, my man. Try and talk to him about some of the stuff you did together. You know, some of the things he'd been interested in. What do you mean? Well, you know, like, the schools-- What? That sort of thing. Aye, mate. You fucking-- Hey. Missed you the other day there, Coco. Semifinals came. With the for the Aberdeen cunts. But this fucking-- Coco, man! Fucking knob, yeah? What's it all about? The cunts, man. Hey, Stevie, how good was that? Aw, it's fucking , ya cunt. Couple of boys got-- Aye, that's just not Resurrection yet, Coco. And what was that? Aye, this. I fucking meant to, man. I thought they were a bit smacky, but this cunt-- this cunt was up all night. I just want to. No fucking use, man. He can't hear us, like. Turn that fucking light off. All right. Aye, aye, what have we got here, then, eh? You dirty cunts. Get a move on. What are you fucking waiting for, man? Her, man. Oh, god, that's fucking disgusting, man! You're fucking sly as fuck. Aw, that's right. Get in there. Get in there. Lose your fucking johnson in her. I'm with ya. I'm with ya. I'm with ya. Get in there. Fucking boobs! Fucking layer it on. Oh, god. Oh, my. What the fuck are you looking at me for, huh? Eyes on the fucking job. What is it? Plow that cow. What the fuck is it? What are you fucking waiting for? The baby. He looked like he was standing up in his cot and looking at us. Don't be so bloody stupid. Come on. Fuck me. I can't. Not with the baby in the same room. Oh, for god's sake! I'm sorry, Jen. It's just, um-- you and the baby, you're so-- you're so close. I just feel so redundant. Oh, shut up and go to sleep. Just because it's in the stupid fucking room. All right, Coco? Coco. Aye. Coco Brice. Coco. - I did, to get married. That's what I heard, anyway. They've been engaged, mind. Engaged. Mind. You don't know, do ya? Mind, we were going to get engaged. Mind, we were engaged. You were just going to get the ring. Engaged. That's right. Colin and Kirsty engaged. Colin, Kirsty engaged. Get the fuck off me! Not here! Not now! Colin! Colin, Colin. Shh. You see, miss, you must remember that your boyfriend has become like a child. But he's accumulating knowledge at such a rapid rate that it's perfectly feasible that he will become completely normal before long. The only problem is, of course, that he will in some ways be different from the Colin Brice that you know. How? Well, he'll have forgotten all of his life experiences, forgotten the good and the bad things he's done that have shaped him. In a way, Colin is like a blank piece of paper, waiting to be colored in by the people close to him. Aye. Well, I'm going to keep him away from all the mates he has in the casuals. And away from drugs, and all. And before this happened, we were going to get engaged. I did not think I was up for it at the time. But him being like a-- vegetable-- but I can make him better. I still want to get married to Coco. Coco. One for me. One for you. Mm. Yummy. Come here. No-- Bug off! Don't you know what that means? Go away. Assholes! Shut it, you, you stupid cow! It's all right. It's all right. It's OK. It's a little early for this, isn't it? Why do we have to devote our lives to structure? This obsession with doing everything at the right time, and having everything in the right place. We have a baby now. Or hadn't you noticed? I'm sorry. I'm confused. Last night-- Christ, do we have to talk about it? Yeah, I think we have to talk about it. I failed to sustain an erection because of my jealousy toward our child. We do have to talk. I mean, that's an issue in our relationship. Why don't you take an advert out in the evening news? Tell the fucking world you couldn't get it up. There, there. Did daddy's shouting wake you up? Oh, Tom. There. Come on, Colin. We'll relax, eh? That's it. And then you take my hand. Aye. You always take my hand, don't you? Eh? That's it. It's Coco, man! Coco, how you doing, mate? All right, man! He's all right. Come on. Is he still, eh? He's still-- - Come on. Coco. Look, man. Leave it. Well, tell me the minute he gets better, then, all right? It's good to talk. He's fucking lost it. We do not carry hatchets. We do not carry cheese. We only carry straws to suck our lemonade. Oh, fuck. That really was strong. Tom? How you doing? I can't-- Oh my god. Tom? This is bloody Rory's fault! This is all bad daddy's fault, isn't it? Well, I'm not going to let anybody hurt my little Tom Tom, am I? Daft cunt. We're going away. We're going away to mommy's mommy. To granny in Cheadle. That's in Manchester, isn't it, Tom Tom? What? Fucking Cheadle? Get the fuck, you daft shoe. I'm going nowhere. I'm not your fucking babe. So pleased to see us. Yes, she will. I'm fucking Coco. Please. Fucking hurts, oi! Fucking tool. Well, well, well. I've gotta get this daft cunt out of the picture. Wait. Jenny? Fucking hell. Don't look now, you daft cunt. Stay cool. Don't freak us out. You spoke, Tom. I did? I-- I did? You spoke. Are you accepting? I mean-- sit down. Fuck. Eh? What's she up to? Heh. You better not say nothing to any cunt about this, straight? I mean, Mother, they would not understand. I'm a sort of phenomenon, in that I've got special intelligence, and that, right? They'd want to take us away. Never. I'd never let them take my Tom away. Thank fuck for that. But this is incredible. My Tom, a special baby. Top, boy. Why? Why us? Why you? Just do. I mean, I smell destiny. Look! These have got numbers. Ah, yes, there's 1,095 pounds. Not the fucking park again. What is it with these posh cunts and fucking parks? Blech! Fuck me. Watch it, Ma-- uh, Jenny, one or two of these things. A? - What? The food. It's no good. I want what grown ups get. None of that veggie shit. Well, Rory and I believe-- I could not give a fuck what you and Rory believe! Eh? I mean, youse have no right to deny me my free choice. You're right, Tom. Well, you're obviously intelligent enough to articulate your own needs, and we must respect that. Tom-- Look at that. Boab Coyle. Why do you talk like that? In that accent? Eh, just keeping my ears and eyes open. The boy likes. Very clever, Tom, but you shouldn't talk like that. I-- I think you should have a more positive role model. Like fucking Rory, for instance? Huh. Well, perhaps not. Aye, well, then. I'm getting a wee bit hungry, though, eh? Well, I'll take you home, and make you something else. Eh-- I was thinking, eh-- a wee bit more of the, uh-- tit, and that. Hm? Come on, Colin. Don't be silly. Whoa. Coco, get up! What? Stand over there. Ah! Coco? All right, boys. Don't see why we had to come to the city central on a Saturday morning. I could have taken you to the park. You liked it there. Fuck, park? All the fucking time. Take away some enjoyment. Let's go have a wee drink, eh? Over there. Look. You're absolutely right. If Rory can do it. - Aye, right? - Fuck him. We'd better get going. Come in. In here. Go on. What are you looking at, you baldy cunt? Come on,. Here comes my boys. Kirsty, what are we doing here? You're going to the football. I want to go to the football. I don't see why we had to come in here. You gotta start in the pub. Part of the strategy. Tom, what are you talking about? Listen, Colin, football's just for silly wee laddies that never grew up. And you're a full grown man. Aren't you? There's my boys. Fucking. Start flinging the punches, diverting the boys. Fighting? Don't want to get huckled straight away, likes. The real starts after the march. Get this-- here comes karma. Coco? Who is this cunt? You-- you baby. Huh? He's lovely. How old is he? I sometimes have to ask myself the same question. I can't believe this. Eight months. Don't fucking touch what you can't afford, cunt. You're a lovely babe. That's right. Really beautiful. That cunt looks like-- me. Well, fucking shit, eh, boy? Boy. Me Coco. Fucking, boy. Don't say I look like that. A baby. What are you? Mommy's little darling boy. Coco Brice! Fucking shit, eh, boy? , Boy! Coco Brice! He's a little darling. Fucking kill ya, huh? Hm? Fucking Coco Brice. , Boys. A fucking boy! Coco fucking Brice, you cunts! Coco Brice! What are you? Tell me what you see. Was it a dream? Was I in it? Life seems so obscene until it's over. Who knows? All I want is someone who can fill the hole in the life I know. In between life and death, when there's nothing left. Do you wanna know? You come in on your own, and you leave on your own. Forget the lovers you've known, and your friends on the road. Tell me if it's true that I need you. You are changing. I've seen this road before, down on this floor. It is hitting me. All I want is someone who can fill the hole in the life I know. In between life and death, when there's nothing left. Do you wanna know? You come in on your own, and you leave on your own. Forget the lovers you've known, and your friends on the road. You go in on your own, and you leave on your own. Forget the lovers you've known, and the friends you have told. Lies. Can you fill this hole inside? Lies. Can you fill this hole inside? I'm coming in on my own. I'm coming in on my own. I'm coming in on my own. Can you fill this hole inside? Can you fill this hole inside?
