Find out what you've got and if it's one of 30 bulls of the whole pen, you're hurtin'. Your meniscus is hurting, your carpal tunnel is bothering you, and so you just pay a few then you leave. Call people out like for stealing your stuff behind the shoot again. Four-second ride, put that baby in slow motion, 60%. That's an eight-second ride on social media, people. I mean, you're at school in math class, like, oh oh oh. On to the next one. Every single post put "On to the next one." The last thing you wanna- - Lovely day, lovely day. Yeah. How you guys doing over here, huh? Another day, another dollar. ♪ Lovely day, lovely day ♪ Ah. ♪ Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day ♪ Oh. Pest control? - Oh. - Don't move. Don't turn around. - Don't turn around. - Okay. - Act natural. - Okay. That's fucking natural? Get the fuck in here, you stupid son of a bitch. What are you doing? - You stupid shit. - Okay, okay. Leave it. Let it bleed. What do you want? Texas Downs. Two weeks ago. You made a bet. I don't have it. Is that going to be your final answer? What do you want me to say? Look I have, I have kids at home- - They know that their dad's a degenerate piece of shit? Huh? The watch. The chain. The ring. That buys you two days. The ring? You either give me that ring, or you give me that finger. That choice is pretty easy. What? You ever bet on the horses? No. You ought to give it a try. It's easy to fix. Yeah. Jockey gives you the signal, the fix is in, odds go up. Just like clockwork. I'll remember that. Usually these envelopes are filled with cash- - He was light. And this? I gave him two days. That's a message so he don't forget. A message? From who? He's got three little girls at home. You want your money, or not? If I want you to send a message, I'll tell you to send a message. What do you want me to do with it now? Sew it back on? I want you to shut up and do what you're told to do! The finger comes out of your end. I'm going to need some time off after this. Time off? You own a time share that I don't know about? I'm done. Just go home. Okay? Get some rest. Come back in two days and we'll talk. See you, Boone. All right. How's the back? Hurts. The leg? Hurts worse. My brother had a picture of you from 2008. He framed it. Look at that. Good looking guy. Yeah. Hey look, I'm sorry to hear about your mother. Word travels fast in this town, don't it? Yeah, well, that's a small town for you. You can resent it but in the end you're just another part of it. Anyway, she was nice. The beer is on me tonight, okay? All right. Have a good night. Thank you. Goddamn it. I should have knocked. Can't seem to keep anything down. I'll call the doctor first thing. Take pills to go to sleep. Pills to wake up. What the hell is the difference? The difference is that something is going to work. Maybe. Maybe I'll just shut my eyes tonight and by the morning this nightmare is finally over. You can't talk like that. I saw the bank sent another letter. A few days ago. When were you going to tell me about it? - I wasn't. - Why the hell not? The letter was addressed to me. I'll call the loan officer first thing. The doctor after. In that order. Which one of these help you sleep? I already took them. Good. You won't mind if I steal a couple. There's the amount of the loan pay off, right there. Three copies. You've got to do the same to each. I sign this and hand you over that money and that house is mine? As long as the payment is made by end of this week. Once that happens, the house is untouchable. But you've got to give me a check by Friday. The bank closes at five. Otherwise, come Monday they will foreclose and take your mother's land. Well this takes care of the reverse mortgage and the back property tax. Anything else? That'll do it. How long have we known each other? Since we were kids. And I never once asked you how you made this kind of money. I told you. Rodeo insurance. Since when do they start giving out PPOs to bull riders? Huh? She can never know about this. Yes? Rodeo? Rodeo. Thanks, Billy. Bet you had a good time putting her in the trailer. This one? Goddamn, 1500 pound Texas tornado. You want to pet him? Maybe next year. So what brings you up here? Came to see Palmer. He bought a stallion. Bringing him in this afternoon if you want to hang out. I can do that. The boys busy? For you? They'll make time for you. Come on. Out! All right, listen here. I think we can make some money off of these guys today. The way they've been roping. What do you think? Man, I had a late night last night, but I think I'm up for it. I am too. How much you got? I've got 200 to put on it. Let's do it. Hey, boys. What you got? I've got 200 here that says you boys can't rope half as fast as us. I'll play with you. He'll play. We'll dang sure play. - Well let's see- - Show your money. Let's do it. I'm short. Short again? - Typical team roper. - Go figure. Let's do some gambling, boys. Sweet, thanks. Who's up first? We'll let you girls go first. There you go! About ready to give it another go? Me? Hell no. A lot easier than riding a bull. A lot safer for that matter. Goddamn right. It ain't that. It, shit. I don't know. You're afraid. Even cowboys get scared from time to time. Yeah. Maybe if you were a better bull rider you wouldn't have gotten bucked off to begin with- - You son of a bitch. Goddamn it. Hey, you all. Look who came to pay us a visit. I'll go get him. All right. Don't be greedy. My father used to say, if a horse could speak, you wouldn't like what he'd have to say. I didn't expect to see you up here. What can I say? I missed the fellas. Hey, I don't pay you all to clown around! Keep waiting for the day you'll sell him to me. He'd make a fine race horse. I didn't buy him to put him up for sale. Shame. Well, I guess it's like asking the barber if I need a haircut. Same answer, every time. Come on in the barn. You can watch me drink a cold one. Oh, that sounds like a lot of fun. The team must be doing pretty well. Not bad. It would be a whole lot better if you were still a part of it. Never was much for roping. Yeah, well these cowboys can't seem to grasp the one skill you always had. You knew it was better to keep your mouth shut and look stupid, than open it and prove it. I heard about your momma. Terrible thing. I appreciate that. You could come back to work? I already got a job. Yeah. Throwing your weight around so someone else doesn't have to. The bank is going to take the house. And you won't sell me the horse? I ain't having this conversation, Palmer. You've always treated me like a son. But you've got to stop. I can look after my own. Fine. You don't want to ride? Then you get back up on the bull. That much, you were good at. Bull broke my back. Bull broke your heart. Look, this life we choose will always give us something to fall back on. And sooner or later we all land flat on it. Listen to what I'm telling you, son. Boone, you chickenshit! Get your ass over here! Now! What the hell happened? Oh, you know what's going on, you son of a bitch. Yeah, yeah. You think you can sleep with my sister, and kick her the curb like a piece of trash? I didn't kick anyone to the curb. Goddamn it, she left me! Bullshit! Come on, Boone, get up. Be a man. You want to beat the shit out of each other for an hour over Brenda, goddamn it! I want to spend all damn night, you- Fuck this. - Come on, Jeremiah. - Goddamn it. You should have thought about it before you fucked my sister. You want me to break this up? No. This is cowboy shit. Yeah, come on, Boone. Don't nothing change with you cowboys, huh? Jeremiah told me what happened. Surprise, surprise. What the hell are you doing here? I came to bring your mother some flowers. Is she asleep? Yeah. I helped put her to bed. She isn't well. I know that. So, what are you going to do about it? Are you reading my mail now? This is addressed to your mother. Well that's something couples do. Read each other's mail. I just glanced at it. Yeah, well, we ain't a couple no more. That's right. You're an asshole. - That's why we aren't. - Okay. Come on, Brenda! Come on, goddamn it! Just stay! - Look, I can't- - Please. I can't. Why not? Because that's what couples do. - Asshole. - God damn it. Brenda! Brenda, hold on. What? I'm paying the bank Friday. And the house, it will be in my name. We could fix it up. Make it our home. Your mother used to tell me, never go someplace that you don't know your way out. I don't know my way out with you, Boone. Who says you've got to leave? I do. You got that money you owe me? Money? What money? I already paid Patty. What the fuck are you talking about? I promise you, sir. I am squared up. I can show you. What the fuck do you mean you already paid Pat? He sent somebody over to my house last night. Okay? What do you mean one of his guys? What the fuck are you talking about? I'm his guy. Another guy. You all look alike. If I find out you're lying, I'm going to come back and cut your dick off. Jesus Christ. What the fuck, Pat? You told me to wait two more days and you get another guy to cash in my job? Relax. Relax? That job was my mine. I need that fucking money. I said, relax. Give us a minute, will you? Who the fuck is that? That's my son. Your son? Yeah. Now I can explain everything, okay? Are you calm? Can you hold your fucking horses for a minute? And sit down? I said sit down! What I said was for you to take a couple of days off, come back, and that we would talk. I had Codi take care of Mr. Finger. You'll split the cut with him. It's only fair. He's fresh out of Huntsville. He still needs some work, but to the potter goes the clay, okay? Besides, I think I know something that will make everybody happy. I was out after this. You knew that. I heard you, yes. But I don't dig for water under the outhouse. Let me ask you something. Every time you got up on that bull, did you think to yourself, this is it. One last ride? The smart money says no. So there's some reason why you want out so bad, and I want to know what that is. My mother is sick. And the bank is after the land. The money I was making here is going to get us out of all that. Goddamn it, Pat, that's the reason I came to work for you in the first place. I see. I want you to work with Codi. One job, show him the ropes and when he's in a good place you'll get all your money and then you can do whatever the fuck you it is you want to do. We got a deal? I'm not a goddamned babysitter. No. But you're going to find out that letting the cat out of the bag is a whole lot easier than trying to put him back in. All right. Good. I'll be in touch. Fucker. What? Hold on, slow down. All right. I'll be right there. What the hell happened, Billy? You said I had until Friday! Just calm down! Calm down? Damn it! A third party came in. That's really all I can say? That's all you can say? Bullshit! Are you done? So what happens now? Can I... An appeal process? Anything? No, Boone. I'm sorry. But like I said on the phone, the house belongs to someone else now. You ain't going to tell me? I want to, I do, but I can't lose my job over this. Is there any way I can make a bid? Honestly, I don't know. That would be between you and the new landowner. Sorry about your office. We lost the house today. It is what it is. That's it? That's all you have to say about it? If there wasn't something wrong there wouldn't be anything right. Dad worked hard for this land. This house is all we've got. The only thing I got left to maybe give to my kids when I'm old. I never thought for you to be the having children type. What type am I? The rodeo type. Same as your dad. Drinking. Womanizing. He'd come home only one or two nights a week. Who taught you to throw a football? Me. Who took you to all your roping competitions? Me. I paid those gate fees. Not him. He was off in Arizona somewhere, maybe locked up for all I know. Same as your uncle. You cowboys, hanging on to this lifestyle likes it's, like it's a goddamn disease! God forbid you should have children. I'm going to find out who bought the house. Make an offer. With what money? I've got some saved. You could sell that horse of yours you never see. I ain't selling the horse. Well. Your Uncle Kyle's not in the will. I figured, figured you should be the one to tell him. Morning. Morning. Who are you here to see? Kyle Carson. All right. May I see your identification, please? Thank you. You've got five minutes. Nice pajamas. Thanks, man. I miss my Lucchese's, though. Yeah, I bet. How are they treating you in there? All right? Not bad. I'm up for parole in a month. No shit. Already? Yeah. It doesn't look good though. Why not? Fucking Mexicans. Always trying to act all hard. Let them fight the skinheads, man. Stay out of that shit. I don't know. It's just something I've got to do on my own, man. You don't forget all that shit. What's new with you? Same old. You back on a bull yet? Not anymore. A guy in here said a rodeo came through town, said you weren't in it. You working for Pat now? Yeah. Does my sister know? Fuck no. Do I look stupid to you? Yeah, kind of. Working for Pat when you could be out there on tour. I couldn't walk for seven months, Kyle. I didn't know what else to do. All right, man. I'm sorry. How is she anyway? Not good, man. Oh, coughing up blood and, I went and saw her doctor and, he said best case scenario, she lives another couple of months. Listen, I've got to tell you something. What is it? She left you out of the will. She said that? She don't mean nothing by it. Fuck that! Fuck that! She never given a shit about me. Don't say that. The only reason I'm telling you is just in case something happens to me, you need to know. You got heat? I don't know. You fucking know if you've got heat or if you don't got heat. Pat's got me in on something with a new guy. Codi. His son. I don't trust him. Listen to me. You still got that horse? The fastest way to double your money is you fold it in half and put it in your pocket. You hearing me? Look, I don't want to be asking permission to come to your funeral. You are all I have left. What about what I said? About the will? Fuck her. I'll be seeing you. Guard. Guard! Get the fuck out of here. What the fuck are you doing here? You been following me? The old man came through. Wants you to take me along. Where were you before prison? El Paso. Why? Who'd you work for? Guy named Ramirez. Ramirez from El Paso. A hotshot like your dad? Yeah, more or less. Which one was it? Does it matter? Guess not. I'm going to clean up. Take a shower. Well how long is that going to take? Well I ain't in a rush, slick. Cold beer in the fridge. Fucking asshole. How the hell are you Pat's kid? It's safe to say you don't look anything alike. You know, there's more to family than blood. Is it true you own a $100,000 horse that you won't sell it to anybody? Hey. You see that? Right there. That door. Yeah. That's what we call a dead drop. It's like a secret location when people pass packages, money- - I know what the hell a dead drop is. All right, smartass. Go check it out. There should be a package for you. Hey, it's how we do things in North Texas. What happened? No answer. No answer? You sure? What the fuck do you think no answer means? Shit. What's that for? Self preservation. Whoa, whoa, whoa. There he is. There's the door. Go get it. Easy now. Who the fuck are you? It doesn't matter. Come on, let me have it. Where Boone at? He's in the truck. You must be the new guy? Yeah. Something like that. Come on. Shit! Fuck. Put it down! You first. We're on the same goddamn team here, man. Then it shouldn't be hard for you to put it away. What the hell did you shoot him for, Codi? I've know this guy five years, he wouldn't do a goddamned thing. I'm just doing exactly how I was told. You were told to listen to me, goddamn it! Look, if you've got a problem take it up with pops. He's the one that gives me orders. Not you. Yeah, that's going to be good. I'm going to have to call you back. You look upset. Fucking right. Codi killed that man in cold blood. He knew about the drop and he shot him anyway. Is there something you're not telling me? I'm the one that gave the order to shoot the guy. He was talking to the cops. He was trying to get protection. And you weren't going to tell me about it? He pulled a fucking gun on me, Pat. Hey, who the fuck do you think you're talking to? I don't have to tell you jack shit. You work for me! Get that through your thick fucking skull! Anything else you want? Tonight's cut puts me where I need to be. I'm out. Is that right? I was always loyal to you, Pat. I never broke that trust. Like that asshole uncle of yours? Just let me have my money and get out of here. You're not thinking this through. You think I'm going to let you just walk out of here? C'est la vie? What's this? That's the deed to your mother's land. I bought it from the bank. You bought it from the bank? That's right. Now, I don't have any use for it, that's not why I did it. I did it to prove my point. You're only out of this business when I tell you that I have no further use for you. Right now, I'm telling you that I ain't done with your redneck ass. I'll kill you. No, you won't. You'll try, but see you're not thinking this through. You're not thinking about your sick mother and what will happen to her. Or that black girlfriend of yours. Not to mention that low-life, scum sucking, fuckhead uncle of yours. What? You think that I can't slit his throat from behind this desk. I make one call, they're delivering you an American flag. What do you want, Pat? I want a horse. Not your horse. A roping horse. Two of them. There's a rodeo in Childress in two days. Your old boss is entering two of his finest. I want you to steal me those horses. How do you want me to do that? Set a cartwheel up outside of town. No chance. Those boys know me. Everyone that you love, everyone that you call family will die if you don't do this for me! Is that clear enough for you? I do this, you hand over that deed to the house. That's mine. And my family ain't to be touched. Well it can't hurt your chances, kiddo. I'll give you until tomorrow to give me an answer. But if you don't show, I'll show you what it means to drive black cattle at night. I found out who bought the house. Now I've got to make a choice between doing something awful or something worse. Palmer always got me out of trouble when I was a kid. Uncle Kyle was always running from the law. And you were always sick. But you all got me through those years after dad left. I ain't never going to forget it. But now, I need someone. I need someone. I never asked you why he left. You always blamed uncle Kyle. But deep down I knew it was me. And I hate myself for it. I wish that bull would have killed me. Kept me going, knowing that some day that big boy was going to put me where I belong. Underneath that arena dirt. Always so dramatic. That's what you think this is? Your father, before he left, did one thing right. What's that? Talk slow, and think quick. You need something with a little more kick? Why the hell not? Because I know how you cowboys get. Here you go. Try that. Well, well, well. Boone "Lightning" Carson. Or is it just Boone now, huh? What do you say, Tip? Well it's been a long time, huh? Last I seen you they was carting your carcass off the Abilene Arena on a stretcher, huh? What are you doing back home? I never really left. You see, that's why they call it a circuit. Because eventually it ends. But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Well, I do know your old boss wants to sponsor me. Good for him. Very good. Say, the least I can do is buy you a drink. Huh? Taking your spot and all. Not tonight. What's that? I said not tonight. Hey, guys. If you two want to beat the hell out of each other, take it outside. I'm going to take a piss. Good to see you, Tip. Too scared to get back on the bull. And too proud to pass the torch to someone new. Say that again. I said you're too scared- - Oh! You chickenshit! Oh! Come on, Boone. She told you to take it outside. Oh my God, napkin. Shit. I've had worse. Lightning. Lightning. So what the hell, man? You don't answer you phone no more? Your mama's been calling for you. The bartender even called me to come pick you up. It sounds like you closed this place down. Literally. What time is it? Time to get your ass home. I got square hay to put out and a pasture to clear. Come on. Goddamn right. You got money for a cab to come back later and get your truck? Hmmm. Lost it. You lost it. Hmm. Goddamn. Boone, what the fuck is wrong with you? Do you know how much those boys at the ranch look up to you? Goddamn, there ain't one day that goes by that one of us ain't telling a Boone Carson story or laughing about one of the many times you came over just to give Palmer hell. If they saw you like this, it would crush them. Erase every good memory they ever had of Boone 'Lightning' Carson. That ain't me no more. That ain't you no more. Well they don't need to know that. And I sure as hell don't believe that. Change that shirt. You smell like a distillery. Get up. Hey. Good morning. You got my message? Yeah. I was asleep. It was three in the morning. What's going on? That day you always talked about that would come. It's here. Are you stupid? I told you not to get caught up with that guy. You've got to stick around to help take care your mother. Which is exactly why I'm going through with this. You know I worry when you get like this. I'm just trying to do the right thing. Not that. The drinking. The decisions. Hasn't your mother had enough? I was never good to you, Brenda. Everybody knows that. But I got to ask you for one last thing. Stay with mother. In case something bad happens to me. Of course. I'd do anything for your mother. I appreciate that. I'll be back when it's over. I'm pregnant. Say that again. You're going to be a father. July is 13.95. I'll do it. But it's a two-man job. Codi's your man. Not him. I need somebody who knows horses. Someone I can trust. No offense. Go fuck yourself. Yeah, you too. Okay. Someone that you can trust. Codi's still going to be there watching the job the whole time, just in case you try to get cute. It's got to be soon. These boys head out early. There's a place right along the way that's going to be perfect for this. And? We could run into some issues. These guys carry guns and they're not shy about using them. That's why Codi's going to be there watching. They can't even know he's around. They sniff someone is on their ass this thing is over. All right? These cowboys treat their prize horses like gold. They'd rather die than see them stolen. Just do it! And one more thing. When this is done and you try and fuck me, I'm going to walk in here and I'm going to put a bullet in your head. You, too, Ponytail. All right? You've got my word. Giddy-up. Go. Go. Play nice. What the hell are you doing here, Brenda? It's your nephew. I think he's in trouble. Not a lot I can do from in here is there? That's why I need you to make parole. I need you to get out. It's not that easy. It can be. Boone, he's about to do something and, it's just, we won't make it far if something happens to him. And you know that. I'll see what I can do. Well, you're going to have to because it ain't just him and me anymore. We're having a baby. You and Boone? Yeah. I can't do this alone. Please. Do you ever get the feeling that none of this means a goddamned thing? That none of it matters? Where I'm from, where I'm going. All this shit and mess we leave behind. I just don't fucking understand it. You know, when you figure that shit out, you'll be good to go. Driver! Put your hands up! Throw the keys out the window! Not today. Now get out real easy like. Get out! Keep those hands where I can see them! Shut the door. Come on, motherfucker. Get over here. Don't fuck around. Turn him around front. Get him on his knees. - Get him on his knees. - Let's go. Trailer, trailer. Come on. Get to the door. Open it. You sure you about that, partner? Did I stutter? Open it. Howdy. Hey, what's going on back there? Go, go, go! Put down the fucking phone. I said drop it. We've got to get the fuck out of here. Warden. On your feet. This ought to be real quick and simple. You give me one good reason why I should even let you sit down in front of that parole board? Always in the whites. Solitary. You know, you straighten up and we might just could move you to post. They got a goddamn tropical smoothie in there. So? I'm ready to go home. I'm ready. Get off me. What is this? What the fuck is this? Pops going to hit the fucking roof when he finds out what happened. Ah, I see. You set this up? Do you really think you're going to get away with it? Not if you're around to tell anyone about it. Okay. Look, I'll leave town. I can disappear. You'll disappear. Where do you think you're going to go where Pat's not going to find you? A rat? In the family? At what point do you think he's going to stop looking for a piece of shit like you? You'll never see me again- - You're right. Okay wait, look. I knew it. I knew you didn't have it in you. All right, can we quit fucking around and untie me? Come on. All right, what happens now. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Now you all here know me. If any one of you all has a problem with what happened here you can leave now. I ain't going to hold any ill will. It's all good with us, Boone. Damn right. I owe you boys my life. You were here when I needed you. And I ain't ever going to forget it. That's what cowboys do. Let's clean this piece of shit up and then let's get some beers. Yes sir. - Sounds like a plan to us. - Thanks, boys. Yes, sir. Pat. Easy! Easy! We're not armed! Where's Codi? Codi's gone. We came as fast as we could. Who the hell is this? Hey, he's with me, all right? Shit went south. They had the horses. It was all Codi's fault. Is that right? He got greedy. Why in the hell would he do that? The fuck if I know. But he's halfway to El Paso by now. You're telling me that Codi tipped off your guys? He was either in on it, or he spooked them. Okay? Think. Could he have called Ramirez in on this one, or what? Ramirez? How do you even know that fucking name? Is it possible? Yes or no? Well where are the horses? I don't know. Perfect. Nobody knows where the goddamn horses are? I do. Show me. I see an empty horse arena. The old man said that my horses would be here. Do you see any horses? They'll be here. When? Do I look like the type of guy that has time to waste? He says they'll be here, they'll be here. Well? Where are the goddamned horses? I told you. Go get my horses. I don't care how you do it, just do it. Old Creepshow wants the horses. What do you want to do? That son of a bitch ain't taking any of my mine. He ain't getting them without a fight. He ain't getting mine. There's a problem. Problem? What problem? They don't want to give you shit. Do they know who I am? No. But it wouldn't matter much if they did. You set me up. You set yourself up, Pat. Who the fuck do you think you are? The only asshole in Texas with a gun? You're going to pay for this. All of you! You think you can humiliate me? This is how it's going to work. You're going to get in that truck and you're going to drive your ass as far away as possible. If I wake up tomorrow and hear you're hanging around, I'm going to kill you. You can explain to the buyers why you don't have the horses, and why you're running with your tail between your legs. Big man. Big man! Yeah. What about your mommy's land? Yeah. Right? I own it! Remember that, you stupid prick? I have the deed! This deed? Sign it over to me right now, Pat. It ain't a discussion. This doesn't change anything. I'm going to come back and I'm going to press you. All of you! Hard! Unlikely. Try me. On the other hand, we can tie the other end of that rope to one of these horses right here and drag your creepy ass out of town with it. See how long it takes before your limbs start tearing off. That's a promise, Pat. Say goodbye to your uncle for me. Well we're all happy to hear you say that, because the boys are going to drag you anyway. Give him a ride, boys! All right. Everything looks good. You got a check for me? Okay. I'll get this to the loan officer downtown. Should have the new deed processed in about two weeks. Free and clear. Thank you, Billy. No hard feelings, all right? Take care of yourself, Boone. You too. Looks like you got your wish, Carson. So, darling, let me get another one of these. Here you go. Thank you. What the hell do you want? I brought you a beer. Yeah. Feel like you need to clean the bar with my face a little bit more? Look. Sorry for being an asshole. All right. Give them hell on the circuit. Hey. I hear tell you're going to be a daddy. Yep. Hey, here's to what the future brings. That bar is hard. I was hoping you were going to be here when I got back. I made you a promise. How is she? She's gone. Hey, hey, hey. Are you okay? Yeah. Okay. You two look good together- - Actually, I just stopped by to say goodbye. Goodbye? He's all yours. The way I see it, a horse ain't meant to wait around. Especially on some chickenshit bull rider. What do you want for him? Nothing. I know you'll do right by him. He deserves that much. You sure you don't need a job? What was that you always said about asking a barber if you need a haircut?

I ain't here about that. Then what is it that you want? Listen, man, I'm here to help, not hurt you. Take this card and call the guy. Get that finger sewed back on. - What? - Take it. Mention my name, he'll fix you right up. Thank you. There's something else. That security firm you work for, are they hiring? Are you asking me for a job? Yes or no? Well, I mean, I, I can put a good word at the main office, but it's not the kind of stuff you want to get into. Right? Unless you've got something bigger I can sink my teeth into. All right. How much do you know? I know about that game in Oklahoma. I know you're involved. Ah, the poker game. Well, that's not just a poker game. See, down south from there, there's a fortune buried underneath this old man's ranch. Yours for the taking. I can get you into. I'm listening. Well first, we're going to have to change your name. Jessup Cross. That's right. Hey, cheers. Cheers. What could go wrong?
