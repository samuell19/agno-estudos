Rebellion Images come back to me. Blurred memories that gradually come into focus... I'm trying to understand how we came to that point. At what moment it all went wrong. I'm a negotiator. My job is to save lives. But on that day, I couldn't do my job. I want to understand why. April 22, 1988 OK. I'm on my way. Be right there. ...he still believes he can win... Before his last key rally this evening at Bourget, Mitterrand is quietly confident of winning the presidential election. At 6:15, Jacques Chirac will be the guest of the RTL-Le Monde Election Special. Chirac, who held his final rally last night near Paris, pleaded for greater rigour... GIGN HQ 78000 Versailles-Satory - France Hi, guys. Captain, JM... A 30-hour flight ahead. Paris-Papeete, then Nouméa in New Caledonia, with a platoon of 50 paras. - How many? - Fifty. Four gendarmes are dead and 30 kidnapped. Leave your car keys, you'll be a while. Bloodshed in New Caledonia. Three gendarmes killed and 20 others taken by force into the bush by Kanak separatists, who attacked a barracks on one of the smaller islands, on the eve of presidential elections in France and regional elections in New Caledonia. The campaign continues... - Welcome, Legorjus. - General. Have you met Ct. Benetti, of the EPIGN? My pleasure. Any new information, Sir? Don't know what happened, but it's a mess. Gendarmes killed, others taken hostage. Even talk of beheadings and summary executions. No details as yet, but they were caught napping. Now the Gendarmerie is in the hot seat... Sir, the wounded gendarme is the father of one of my men. - Really? - Warrant Officer Moulié. A Mobile, he's been evacuated to Australia. - Work fast, Captain. - Yes, Sir. Vincent! It's about your dad. He was injured during the attack. Shit, I hope his dad's not dead. What are these Kanaks? Cannibals? You understand? I'd rather you took care of your mum. OK. Sorry about that... - Good luck. - Thanks. Gentlemen! Could I have your attention please? We're heading for New Caledonia, where 12 hours ago a group of Kanak separatists attacked the Gendarmerie of Fayaoué on the island of Ouvéa. Three gendarmes were killed, one seriously injured and thirty Mobile Gendarmes taken hostage. That's all we know for now, but I'd remind you that New Caledonia is a French territory and that Kanaks, separatists or not, are French citizens subject to the same laws, rights and duties. Our scope of action is like at home. We have a 30-hour trip ahead of us... Could you hand out these maps? I'd ask you to rest up and study the maps, thank you. Have a good flight. Bloody hell! It's tiny. We'll find them in no time. Yeah, we'll even have time to surf. Patrol Puma Fox Mac Delta, authorised for taxi-way 11. Nouméa Airport 98800 New Caledonia - Overseas Territory Christ, it's a bloody invasion! What the hell's going on? What's the Army doing here? Welcome General, Captain... Excuse me... Major Baucheron. General Vidal asked to speak with you. What's he doing here? Don't know. He arrived last night with his entire staff. Set up his HQ on Ouvéa. A helicopter's waiting, your men will follow in Pumas. - What's going on? - No idea. Must be a change of strategy. Philippe! What's happening? Heading for Ouvéa. You follow in Pumas. Take the bare minimum. See you later. OK. D-Day minus 10 Army HQ - Village of Gossanah 98814 Island of Ouvéa Sir... General Jérôme. Good day, General. Good to see you. Captain Legorjus, GIGN. Good day, Captain. So, how was your trip? Fine, it's the landing that's tough. Fall in! At ease. - Coffee? - With pleasure. Can someone make a coffee for the General? I know your problem. It's a Gendarmerie issue, for us to solve. Yes, I'd have gladly stayed home. But I was sent by the French Government. Faced with revolt, the PM decided to send in the Army. That's a first. On French territory, such things are the GIGN's job. But here we must work together. Not a problem, I hope? What's my scope? I'd like to have cooperation between my units here and yours in Nouméa. Other Gendarmeries on Grande-Terre are under threat, it's tense. I need your help to ensure that what happened here doesn't happen elsewhere. - Then I'm at your disposal to coordinate it. - Thank you. I'm sure Captain Legorjus can be of help. Yes, we can use your men and skills, but you'll have to abide by our way of working. General, my men and I are at your disposal. Thank you, gentlemen. No victory without cohesion. Safe return to civilisation. Thank you, General. Attention! At ease. So how do we handle this? You heard Vidal. We're under their orders. But it's our job! This is France, how's it possible? All is possible in wartime. Look around you. It's the first French Army occupation since Algeria. Well, we share the same goals. The same goals, perhaps, but not the same methods. I'll be at the Nouméa barracks, call if you need me. Thank you, Sir. Good luck, Philippe. He's heading back? To Nouméa, to handle support. We're now under Army orders. Lieutenant, can you find me 20 para uniforms? Of course, Captain. Here. As you know, separatists attacked Fayaoué barracks yesterday at 08:30. We're here, at Gossanah, in the north. Having emptied the armoury and butchered four gendarmes, they split their hostages into two groups, one south, the other north. South, is Colonel Benson, he knows the tribes. He's moved into place. Up north, all we know so far is that the key commando members are from here, the Gossanah tribe. How many men do you have? Two platoons positioned in Gossanah, and two patrollers. The Hubert Commando and 11th Shock are on alert. A total of 300 men. Captain, we've localised, 4 kilometres from here, the trucks used to transport the hostages. If your guys could help us comb the area? Sure, Colonel, we could use some exercise. Ready in 30 minutes. Thank you. Excuse me, you don't wear uniforms? Not really, Colonel, but we adapt. Very good. Well, thank you. That'll be all. "That'll be all." Not heard that in a while. Me neither. And did I hear "11th Shock"? You sure did. Great start to the holidays! Gents, the Captain wants a word. OK, guys,' as you've understood, the Army has taken over. The politicians chose to place us under their orders. So they'll give us missions and we'll execute them with zeal. OK? I'd ask you to blend right in, but to keep the group united. Is that clear? Thank you. We'll be wearing para fatigues, no GIGN insignias. Recce mission in 30 minutes, light arms, machetes. Welcome to New Caledonia. Clear the way! Captain Legorjus, GIGN. Good day, Captain. - All OK? - Fine. - Touch anything? - Ordered not to. Thank you. OK, guys, easy does it. Report: four cases of ammunition found. Second truck short circuited, kaput. Seems they know the equipment. OK. - No clues? - None. Found nothing. Listen... We're going in, OK? OK. Infiltration, guys. You take the right, I take the left. OK. Once you reach the military fringe, we regroup and line up. Right. See you in a bit. Two and a half hours for 500 metres? Yeah, with three hours left. So that'll make one kilometre in a day, in line, so we'll have combed hardly anything. In fact it's not that bad. I was a bit hard on the chef. Just some kids. So boys, where are the hostages? Let's go. We won't find them by searching at random. All armies are powerless against guerrillas. Our methods are totally different from those of the Army. The key to all hostage taking is the negotiation it engenders. They know where we are, let them make their demands. D-Day minus 9 D-Day minus 8 Attention! Good day, Sirs. Great to be here with you. I'm very impressed with your operation. - Colonel Dubut, Chief of Staff. - Colonel. Mr Minister. Mitterrand and Chirac must be at loggerheads. Who's the guy in blue? Pons, Chirac's minister for Overseas Territories. When's the second ballot? - In twelve days. - So he's piling on the pressure. What's he's saying? "The French Government will not be humiliated "by a bunch of savages within our Republic "that we cannot even locate on such..." ...a small island. The Prime Minister and the Government can no longer accept this insult to the very principles of our democracy. Gentlemen, I don't understand, with 300 men on this island and every available means, you can't find 30 hostages? So, what's the situation? We've begun our searches, but the vegetation's so dense, we're doing what we can, Sir. With regard to questioning, no significant results so far. Then you'll have to up the pace and get results, fast. We are counting on you and your professionalism to re-establish justice and peace in this French territory. I hear you, Sir. The Prime Minister assures you of his unfailing support for your every decision. Thank you, gentlemen. What's the story? They're beefing up the interrogations. I don't want us involved, so we're heading out. Prepare your stuff, guys. We're leaving in 10 minutes. The southern group has been freed, heading for Fayaoué barracks. I'll stay to save face, while the others recce. OK, see you later. Right. Welcome back, guys. Fayaoué Gendarmerie 98814 Island of Ouvéa - Samy... - Colonel. A pleasure to see you and thanks... - Talk to the chiefs in Mouli? - Yes, they'll do their duty. OK, now go rest. Colonel Benson? - Philippe Legorjus, GIGN. - My pleasure. So you managed to free everyone without a shot fired? That's magic. No, I just told them the north had freed their hostages. That simple? They weren't for this, so they're relieved. Those responsible decided to give themselves up. Incredible. No, you'll see, with the Kanaks, talking pays. Come and meet Samy. A gendarme here for 11 years, he was taken hostage. - Nice to meet you, Samy. - Captain. I'll let you talk. I'll head back with you. So, Samy... Still have your weapon? They freed us with our weapons, but no ammunition. They buried it, we'll retrieve it later. - And what's that? - This? It's Kanak custom for asking forgiveness. Incredible. So you saw the whole thing? It was very quick, very violent. It was morning, we were raising the flag... All was well, like every morning. Some of my colleagues were still at breakfast. It all started here. Three Kanaks arrived, one with lobsters, another empty handed, the third with a hatchet. They used to often come to bring us the morning's catch. With all the backup to feed their fresh fish was welcome. Good day, gents... But this time, they'd come for something else. Fancy some lobster? - How much? - Six thousand. Ten times more than last time! - You have no say here. - Yes I do. - Peaceful occupation. - What do you mean? Here, we're in Kanaky! - You're in a French Gendarmerie! - And you're in Kanaky! Don't you shout at me! The first down tried to intervene. Drop that radio! The second tried to sound the alarm. And then, all hell broke loose. The third tried to reach the armoury. And the two last victims were out of panic. Who was leading the rebels? Peaceful occupation! I think it was Alphonse... Alphonse Dianou. Who is he? A young guy from here. We played football as kids. He grew up in Nouméa. He's an intellectual, studied in Fiji. Even wanted to be a priest. Samy, I know you're tired, but I need you up north, can you come? Don't worry, Captain. I'll rest when this is all over. Now the first group's free, Vidal may stop warmongering and let you do your job up north. Vidal has cards to play and he will. But in the wrong game. Stop the vehicle! Head over to the right! Where are they? You bastard! You dirty nigger! You fucking ape! I order you to stop! Where are they? Talk! We'll do your wife and kids! I order you to stop! These are innocent civilians! Let go of him! Who are you? Gendarmerie? Go fuck your orders! No... Take it easy! Cyril! OK, head out! If you want to file a complaint, go to the Gendarmerie. What's going on here? It's like a trench camp. The Army in all its glory, they want results. Bloody hell! Who's that? Djubelly Wea, the village chief. Djubelly, how long have you been here? Since your general invaded my tribe! It's unacceptable. I'll free you, I'll see Vidal. It's too late! You treat us like pigs here. Look what you're doing! Go tell your General Vidal what you're doing here. Calm down. You are not on conquered land! How long must Kanaks endure this? From Atai to Machoro and you continue to trample and make war on us. I don't need your water. Away with you! This is Kanaky, not France. Be gone! Samy... What are you doing here? You no longer care for your clan? Your fathers, your mothers, and your brothers? You ignore them now! Proud of yourself? Go, Samy, away with you. - Out of my sight. - Let's go. Be gone! You're fuelling the fire by pressuring the inhabitants! Kanaks don't bend under pressure, they get stronger. 15 of your colleagues are still captive. We can't let up now! You're stupid and blind. Look around you! You're making your very own enemies. For your own little war! We don't need your advice. We came here for the Gendarmerie. It's your men who screwed up, who got taken prisoner. Stay in line, Benson, instead of criticising our methods. Methods? All I see out there is barbarity! Four gendarmes, hacked to death, and we're the barbarians? Gentlemen, please... His methods worked down south, maybe we can use them here and avoid imposing our superiority. That's enough nonsense! Colonel Benson didn't bargain for the release of the hostages. They were freed for fear of reprisals. Up north, it's totally different. We're dealing with ultra-violent radicals some trained in Libya! And our mission is to neutralise them immediately. When we find them, we'll talk and they'll listen. As for use of force, you can count on me, I'll use it! That will be all. Dammit! Good day to you, General. You all right, Colonel? Know what Vidal's after? To make his career. A little war in the Pacific was unhoped-for. He'll get his medal and double his pension. Putting us all in danger. I don't know how you'll manage to do your job, but as of today the Kanaks are your enemies. So good luck to you, Legorjus. Thank you, Colonel. So, guys, how's it going? What's new? It's beginning to stink here. - It's a free-for-all. - So I noticed. What's going on? It's a Kanak hunt. - The others are still on recce? - Yeah. OK, let's get out of here. UP! On your feet! Talk! Where's that fucking cave? Are you deaf? Talk, motherfucker! Where are your brothers? Want I shoot your friend? Want I give him one? Talk! Gimme that gun! Give it here! Up you get. You too, up. JP, look after them. But it's not even loaded. Are you fucking kidding? What difference to him? Back home he'll say you tried to kill him! He'll take his revenge sooner or later. What's got into you? Scare tactics, they may know the cave. And so? It justifies that? That's torture! We don't do that! Not us. We don't fall for that. We don't fall into that trap! Elric, Olivier, we continue our advance. OK, pack up, let's go. By pretending we're fighting terrorists we dehumanise our opponents making violence so much easier to the detriment of future negotiations. That's what I want to avoid. Good news at last, gentlemen. Thanks to the excellent work of our field units, the villagers have indicated where the insurgents may be. D-Day minus 7 Two of their elders and a youth will lead us there. Destremeau, you'll handle radio contact. Legorjus, you'll provide support to the combat unit. Benetti, the EPIGN will give backup. Dubut, you will coordinate the whole. Gentlemen, any questions? No, General. Then, let's go. Vince! It's me, Uncle. Alphonse! It's us, the elders. Antonin? This way? In this direction? Patrick to Philippe. We've stopped. They don't seem to agree. One wants to go straight, the other, to the left. Advancing anew, straight ahead. Over and out. Call them one more time. Who's there? What do you want? It's me, Uncle. Uncle, what're you doing here? - I'm with the elders. - We've made contact. Go back to the tribe! JP, they've made contact. Contact! Contact! The tribal elders want that we talk. The tribe is suffering. We have to be brave. No going back. We're determined. You must hold fast, Uncle. Our hearts must be one. I need three guys to come with me to see what's going on. You others stay here. Secure the zone. OK, go. On the left of the trail. You, soldier! Lay down your bag! Drop your bag! And bring that radio here! We'd like discussion. The children of the tribe are suffering. There's much pain in the village. And the children, they can no longer bear it. It's all right, Uncle. Come, come. Destremeau's bag is there. Don't shoot, they're firing in the air. We're Gendarmerie, we've come to talk! Talk? Talk With who? We don't talk. Go fuck yourselves! To hell with the Gendarmerie! Go home! Too risky. Fall back. Retreat. Guys, here's the situation. Destremeau has vanished with the radio. There's a sniper 70 metres ahead in that direction. Just a sec... There are five or six insurgents behind him. They threw rocks at us and fired over our heads. They can see us, we need a safety perimeter. We can't see them, so be careful. Sierra, receiving you, but faintly. Captain, the Deputy Public Prosecutor is on his way. Who? He's offering to help initiate dialogue. I see no one. He's on the trail. OK, he's here. Over and out. Captain Legorjus. Jean Bianconi. Deputy Public Prosecutor. Manage to talk with them? Won't talk with anyone in uniform. Listen, I probably know some of them. I could try to dialogue. That'd help, but what if they insult you? These folk don't insult, Captain. This is Jean Bianconi, Deputy Public Prosecutor. Some of you already know me. I'm ready to come alone to talk and serve as a mediator with the authorities. Talk about what? Your damn Republic has been shafting us for centuries, so fuck it! See? That's not insult. Then I'd like to know what is. Jean, what're you doing? - Wait here. - You're crazy, they'll shoot. Stay here. Gimme your canteen. Stay put, don't budge. Jean, what are you doing? Want them to talk to me? Here, people say things face to face, eye to eye. You're making a big mistake. You, over here! Hands behind your head. Hands behind your head. On your knees! Down, down! Who are you? Don't move. What do you want? I'm Deputy Public Prosecutor, we've come to talk. And what's that? Poisoned water? To drug me with? You may be a big wig in Nouméa, but here you're nothing. Who are you? What unit? Talk! I'm from Paris, dispatched here. What for? To take pot-shots at separatists? We came to talk. How many are you? How many! Answer me! - Six or seven, along with me. - Quit lying, talk! I came with six gendarmes, six! Bring your men here. You can't ask that. We give the orders here! You're not master. I can't bring them here, you're already 15! Vince, go get a gendarme from the cave. Call your men, or I'll kill a gendarme. Did you hear? - Don't do that. - Bring your men here! Head up! - Call your men! - Call your men! Stop this! Take your finger off the trigger! Bring your men here! On your feet. Call your men! Ever heard of dialogue? Come, all six of you! It's Philippe! Come, the six of you! Louder. Come, the six of you! Guys... I need five men to come with me. Philippe messed up himself. - He doesn't want us to come. - It's an order. The order of a hostage. We're dead men, it's a trap. Bunch of wimps! - OK, let's decide. - I'll go. - And me. - Not you, I need an officer. Antoine, leave the radio and come. Another two. Bloody hell! Captain, you'll need me too. Perfect. Leave the handguns here. Retreat 200 metres and get the equipment. OK, let's fall back. How many are they? On your knees, down, down! - Why are you with these guys? - Don't do this. Over here, in the middle. What to do with you? We'll soon have a full house. They're not gendarmes, they're GIGN! Not gendarmes, GIGN! Look, a list... Perrot? He ordered the shooting of Machoro four years ago. Is there a Perrot here? You, look at me! Did you kill Machoro? Who killed Machoro? Leave him be! Wasn't us! Take it easy. Talk or you're dead! Talk, or he's dead! Shut your trap! Enough! Enough of this, we're surrounded by the army. They're in the village. Why do you protect them? I'm not protecting them, you know me. You're protecting them. Traitor! I, Alphonse Dianou, with my club and my men, I defy the world's third army! You'll listen to us at last, or all die here! Take them to the cave! Uncuff the gendarmes and cuff the GIGNs! Down you go, you too! Samy, on the left! Left, soldier! - You, down! - Eyes down, what're you looking at? - Vincent... - Step on it! I ask but one thing of you... To have heart. They came to kill us, not to talk! We're fighting for you, for our country. These murderers don't respect you. They're occupying our lands. They don't know our customs. Did you hear the Elder? Are you listening? This is a sacred cave. When the Elder speaks, you must listen. The word must be respected. Vince, think of your children. That's what I wanted to say to you. Have heart, humility, consideration and respect. This cave is part of our values, our culture, our custom. I ask you to respect that. That's all I ask. He's right. What do you want? We need to negotiate now. Negotiate what? Let's think it over, together. So what's your offer? How long is it since you ate? Martin! Here, guys, eat. See what it's led to? They have eight hostages more, and I can't do my job. Not a good initiative. It was your initiative to follow me. They'd have never felt threatened by a civilian. I don't tell you your job so don't tell me mine. Ever worked on a hostage taking? Well, I... Reasoned with a fanatic in a courtroom four years ago. Here, the court is them. And our job is to lower the pressure. So we have to stay positive. We didn't intend to kill. That wasn't our plan. The operation was organised and vetted by the FLNKS. The plan was to peacefully occupy Gendarmeries on different islands. To obtain what? Annulment of the Pons Law and the territorial elections during the presidentials. Pons thought he'd push it through. Know what that law means for us? The end of our customs, our traditions, our chieftainships. We couldn't let that happen. Now, our struggle has broadened. We want what we've endlessly fought for, our independence. And the dead gendarmes? Those who killed are ready to go to prison. Every struggle has its victims, these dead included. And what does the FLNKS say? How should I know? Here, I've no contact with them. Alphonse, the FLNKS ordered no other attacks on Gendarmeries. You're lying! No, he's telling the truth. And we in the south were freed without a shot fired. Alphonse, we have to find a solution, together. What do you need? You must contact Nine Wea in Gossanah, he'll know how to join Franck Wahuzue of the FLNKS. From there, the politburo will tell us what to do. Otherwise, we maintain our position. Thank you. Thinking of the elders? Yes, of their words. I think of what they said. You're thinking of it too? Me too. What's that? It's coming from Gossanah! Philippe!! What're they doing? Killing the Gossanah folk? The Army could never do that. Oh yeah? You torture our wives and kids. It could be a massacre! We're all on edge, let's not do anything silly. - I'll go check and return. - I'll shoot you! I'll stay, to negotiate by your side. Let me take the sick gendarme. - Don't piss me about! - Tell me what you want. I want the Army to leave Gossanah, now. Now! Will you be all right? How are the guys doing? You put us in danger. They found a list in a bag. Talk about it later. So, Captain, you managed to escape, well done. No, they let me go with a sick gendarme to dialogue. With six extra hostages they can afford to be generous. What do they want? That the Army leave here by 6:00 AM. Is that a joke? No, General, it's a condition. Mr Minister, Captain Legorjus, freed by the rebels, is right here. He has information for you. Captain Legorjus, your liberation is the first good news we've had. So, who are we up against? Determined people, but who want to find a way out. They want a retreat from Gossanah. And if not? They threaten to execute one of my men. General, any objections to withdrawing from Gossanah? Tactically, no, Sir. We've located the cave, we can retreat to St. Joseph, but we lose the upper hand. I authorise you to withdraw as soon as you can. Very well, Sir. Here's Captain Legorjus. Mr Minister, the rebel leader, Alphonse Dianou, asked me to contact the FLNKS to negotiate with the government. Then do so, but only on humanitarian grounds and report back to me. Happy now? The sooner you order it, the sooner we can do it, Sir. Alphonse... It's Philippe. Philippe, what was that gunfire? Sentries, firing on goats. If you're not back by 6:00, I kill one of your men. Alphonse, listen. The Minister authorised the troop withdrawal. But it'll take a little time. I'm listening. I also need time to locate the FLNKS representative. I can't return right away, understand? I'll send kids to check the Army's leaving. Good, Alphonse. Don't listen to him, he'll betray us. Step on it. 30 minutes, guys. D-Day minus 6 Do we head north or south via the beach? Philippe, you wanted to see Mr Wea? He's here. Hello, Mr Wea. Are you well? I have a favour to ask you. I was with Alphonse, he gave me your name. He'd like you to help me contact Franck Wahuzue of the FLNKS. Could you do that? I don't know how I can. I can take you to Fayaoué by jeep. I can't cross the island in a military jeep. Then we go by helicopter, more discreet. They threw people overboard. Who told you that? An elder from Teouta. They even threw our chief overboard, from a height. You'll be safe with me. Good day. I need your phone and office, please. Thank you. It's ringing. Hello, Franck? It's Nine Wea. Sorry? He hung up. He thinks you're still a prisoner in Gossanah. We'll call him back. Tell him why and how you're here, OK? It's ringing. Franck, don't hang up. It's Nine Wea. I'm at Fayaoué Gendarmerie. I'm with a gendarme... - Your name? - Philippe. His name's Philippe. What? No, I don't have a gun to my head. He thinks I've a gun to my head. He was in the cave with Alphonse. He was released to talk with you. Can he meet with you? OK. Thank you, Franck. He agrees to meet you. Tomorrow at 8:00 AM. - Where? - On Lifou Island. Perfect, thanks a lot, Nine. I'm sure to need you again, OK? Philippe... You know they're not killers. Yes, I know. Of course I know. Two days without sleep, yet I feel good. At last, I've found my place. My enemy now is time. My goal is mutual understanding. High Commission Minister's Residence - 98800 Noumea Mr Minister, General Vidal and Captain Legorjus. Good day, gentlemen. Glad you're unharmed, Captain. Your exploits toured the ministries. - Hello, General. - Mr Minister. So, Captain. Did they mistreat you? They were fair, despite the pressure and fatigue. And your men? That's more tricky. They learnt that we're GIGNs. They may try to avenge Machoro, killed by the GIGN four years ago. - You fear for their lives? - Yes, I do. So we must negotiate as soon as possible. The troop withdrawal from Gossanah should help dialogue. Sure, but they killed four gendarmes and taunt the French Army. We won't kowtow to a bunch of fanatics. Those who killed will give themselves up. - These are family men, youths... - Family men? My thoughts go to the families of the murdered gendarmes. As do mine, General. Understanding our adversaries helps us find solutions. By leaving Gossanah, we've lost the chance of an early surrender. That's our objective. Gentlemen, my goal was to facilitate dialogue. Captain, have you contacted the FLNKS? I'm meeting a key member tomorrow. Glad to hear it. As you know, we consider the FLNKS a terrorist group and we rarely talk to terrorists. Yet the FLNKS ordered the attack on the Gendarmerie. The killing of the gendarmes? No, the FLNKS ordered a peaceful occupation. Against what? Your law, Mr Minister. Well... We'd like you to brief Army staff on the situation on the ground. You may take a shower in my bathroom. Thank you, Mr Minister. From what I saw, there are 25 to 30 insurgents within the crater itself spread out pretty much at random. There are combat posts on the heights. I spotted one here, another further north. We're awaiting reconnaissance from the EPIGN patrols to enable us to identify others around the crater. It's from here that one can access the cave where the hostage gendarmes are being held as are my men in somewhat tougher conditions. The insurgents know they are GIGNs? Unfortunately, they found a list forgotten by one of my men. Bravo, Captain. The work of an amateur. Not only are you all taken hostage, you also give them your brief. I warn you, if anything goes wrong you are responsible. Yes, General, I accept full responsibility. I had to decide fast in extreme circumstances. Yet oddly, our mistakes have let us make contact with the rebels and to ease the pressure, avoiding combat and initiating dialogue. That's what matters. I hope you'll be proved right, Captain. - Any further questions? - No, Mr Minister. Just a quick word, please. - What would you like to know? - An update... Mr Pons received us and gave us the government's instructions. He was surprised to learn that it's still unresolved... - Hi, Philippe. - Hi, Dominique. Heading back to Ouvéa? - Any room for us? - Sorry, I can't. Tell Mr Pons it's undemocratic not to let us report on site. We can't do our job. All we have is rumours, which Paris loves. Sorry, I can't say any more. We're at the Sofitel, if you want to talk. OK, thanks. Bye, Dominique. Meunier Gendarmerie Crisis Cell - 98800 Nouméa Wait, I'll be right back. General Jerôme's office? That way. - Philippe! - General. Glad to hear of your release. - Coffee? - Yes, please. So, how's it going? Well, it's not easy. Yet the men are OK and the fact they let me go is encouraging. But I just met with the Chiefs of Staff and I'm carrying the can. I told you, the elections won't make it any easier. They fear for their careers. If we can't talk to the Army here, imagine Paris. I can't deal with politicians, I need time to work. You should call your former boss. Prouteau? He has the President's ear, he can win you time. It's the President versus the PM? More than likely. I don't envy you, Philippe. You'll also have to handle the politicians. Massacre in Ouvéa Weapons of war in the hands of the FLNKS Christian Prouteau's Office Elysée Palace - 75008 Paris Hello? Philippe, I was expecting your call. How are you? Heard about our men? Yes, but I'd rather have your version. Well, I'm in a tricky situation, but it could work out well. Managed to start negotiating? The Kanaks are ready to talk, but not Pons. Does the President know? Here, we know nothing. News is filtered by the Chirac clan. What's your take on it? As usual, on the one hand we'll need time, on the other, quick decisions. What do the Kanaks want? Their independence. Isn't the President close to the FLNKS? Yes, he's friends with Tjibaou. Pass the message that we'll need them. They'll be key to dialogue. These are not fanatics, just guys who messed up. I'll talk to the President. Keep us posted. You're all we've got over there. Alphonse, you asked me to make contact with Franck Wahuzue, with the politburo, to see what they could do for us, by way of mediation. We had Franck on the phone and he gave us his agreement. He asked that we meet him tomorrow in Lifou. The token I have here in my hands is a little thought from the elders back home. From the mothers, the elder women, the children. Because it's true we have suffered and been mistreated. It was very tough what the tribe had to bear. But we know why. It's for our struggle. The struggle we continue today, that our elders began yesterday. The simple folk back home, all they ask, is that we negotiate, so no more blood is shed. The elders say what happened at the Gendarmerie is enough. That's all I wanted to say. I speak on behalf of the elders and the tribe. Boys, this is Nine's token. Thank you. Thank you. It is good news you bring us. We wanted an army withdrawal. And we hope this will soon be over. Many of us are fathers here. I too hope to go home soon to see my kids. Thank them for the gesture, on our behalf. Kojac? Lars? Jonas? Oleti... For the news you bring us. Because you've done what was asked of you. What happened at the Gendarmerie wasn't what we wanted. Now we find ourselves here. Thank you, my brother. Thank you too to all the mothers, all the fathers back in Gossanah, all the children. Oleti. As Vince said, we are all fathers here. All of us. Oleti. Alphonse, I've something to ask you. I know what it is. Go ahead, go see your men. Thank you. How's it going, guys? Holding up. And up above? They let me leave. Got the Army out of Gossanah, it's eased the pressure. Not like here, it's intimidation. But they don't know it's me. I'll find solutions, but I need time, OK? Don't worry, we'll manage. Guys, thanks a lot. You saved my arse. Checking out our defences? Daniel, Thomas, back to your posts. And you, come here. Sit down. I know who you are. You move like a GIGN, not an ordinary gendarme. No, I'm not... Don't worry. We won't harm your men. But I want you to promise me something. Whatever you want. All the men with me here are family men, fishermen, youngsters, not murderers. They're here because of me. But they don't deserve to die. In the case of an assault, promise they'll be spared. Why an assault? Because that's the logical outcome. It's how you solve problems. Alphonse, I'll do my best to avoid that. But you're right on one thing. The pressure's now on the military and they're scared. And that's never good. You ought to consider freeing the hostages to protect your men. You still don't understand. There's no going back. If we yield to your demands with no sure outcome, all will have died in vain. The gendarmes, Machoro, and our fellow freedom fighters. And you know why? For the nickel in the mountains of Grande-Terre, processed in Nouméa. The nickel without which we'd not exist for you. This red land that your ancestors stole from us for a pack of cigarettes, or a bottle of alcohol. The nickel for which you ravage our land, pollute our air, our seas, via which you've injected poison into our veins, money, drugs, alcohol. That money which guides your every step, that decides who's good and bad, that locks you into your dormitory towns. Living only to earn more. But when you'll have changed the world into money the last survivors of your apocalypse will be us. D-Day minus 5 Franck Wahuzue's House - FLNKS branch - 98820 - Lifou Island You're asking me to negotiate with a government that calls us terrorists who had our leader murdered by a GIGN four years ago. I'm asking you to help Alphonse and his men. To give them good advice. They need you. Alphonse organised his own attack. He lost control of his men. No one should've died. What's done is done, but what now? If the FLNKS claims responsibility, who'll protect us from your politicians' accusations of barbarity? You'll silence them by participating. Alphonse has 23 hostages. There are 300 soldiers in Ouvea. Before we can commit to this, your Minister must declare that we are not a terrorist organisation and accept the legitimacy of our struggle. Is that clear? We need to set up a negotiation table so the government can respond to your demands. We want to begin dialogue on our situation with the next government. The next? This government wants a solution before elections end. You can't close the door on them. I'm not closing doors, but I can't talk in a void. So when is the FLNKS going to show? Seems they don't want to commit themselves. Then it requires a mediator to begin talks with the FLNKS and who will stay on after the elections. - Appointed by whom? - The President. With the PM's agreement. Why not. Good. It'd help me plead our case outside. The government will not backtrack to absolve the FLNKS of its crimes. We'll not consider them differently under the cloak of negotiation. As for the next government, tell them this one prevails. And I have a condition for you, Captain. Do not return to that cave. For what reasons? We're responsible for your safety. Alphonse trusts me, I risk nothing. It's an order from above, Captain. Thank you. Mr Minister. Hello? Philippe! You want news? I can't reach Jean-Marie Tjibaou and Yeiwene Yeiwene. I'll keep trying- Call me later. Yes. Christian, Philippe here. What's going on? Here, the FLNKS is stalling and Pons is being difficult. What did they tell you? That they can't reach the leaders. They're pissing you about. Tjibaou is in Nouméa right now. Don't they want to talk? About what? Their independence? Think it'll be settled over four deaths and a few hostages? And the mediator? He's just been appointed by the President. We're waiting for Chirac to sign too and he's taking his time. What the fuck's going on? It's political. The stakes are beyond us. You're saying 23 hostages might die because of the elections? Wise up, the real war is here. The PM wants to silence us. Pasqua's preparing a hostage scoop in Lebanon. Well, these hostages won't be freed with bribes and no one's looking for peaceful solutions. Pons and his cronies don't want a peaceful solution. What do you mean? They need National Front votes to elect Chirac. So they want to seduce the far right by hammering the separatists. And risking our men's lives? It's up to you to find solutions. So I can't count on you? Count on who? Campaigning politicians? You can only count on yourself. I'll send you backup. I don't need backup, I need time. Time's running out. May I suggest, though its seriousness warrants more, that you both devote two minutes to the crisis in New Caledonia. Two minutes each. Mr Mitterrand? What matters today, now as I speak, is the liberation of the gendarmes and the magistrate being held hostage, which is intolerable. And I'd like to pay tribute to the bravery and sense of public service of the victims of this act. But what is essential today and for the future is dialogue. Yet the government has opted for brutality, forgetting that dialogue is the rule of the Republic. So dialogue must be renewed with all the stakeholders of New Caledonia. Mr Chirac, two minutes. I know Caledonia well, I'm very fond of it. I've been there 11 times. In actual fact, dialogue has been undertaken and has shown that the great majority of Melanesians today favour a solution that consists of remaining part of France. But there is a small group, that rejects Melanesian and Kanak cultural tradition and custom, namely, the FLNKS. They are a terrorist group. And I'll do my utmost to defeat this terrorist group, as I have done elsewhere. What we are witnessing, sadly, is the total failure of your policy. Mr Mitterrand, all we had during Socialist mandates was exasperation, thirty-two dead, hundreds injured... Your policy is only worsening the sense of injustice and intolerance... One cannot say things like that... D-Day minus 4 Gentlemen, what are our possible options? - Commander? - Mr Minister, General, Gentlemen, from our latest analysis of the ground reports, we envisage the firing of blank warning shots, perhaps even empty warheads, to create a diversion for the land-based assault. The joint fire power of our two patrollers should sow enough panic and disorder to allow our men to advance with maximum safety. Thank you, Commander. And then? According to reconnaissance by Captain Legorjus and the EPIGN there are two ways in. One, crater side, has the drawback of being known and hence protected by the rebels. While the other, cave side, is difficult to negotiate due to dense vegetation and rocky terrain. We envisage the "cleansing" of the zone using a 250kg laser-guided bomb launched from air or sea. To be efficient, it requires backup from helicopters fitted with 20mm canons. We are also considering the Napalm option, which would immediately clear access to the cave for an assault by the 11th Shock Regiment. Mr Minister, these warfare options are totally disproportionate to this crisis we face. Nor do I see the need for the 11th Shock and Hubert Commando. Such units are unsuited to the situation. Offensive action will lead to a bloodbath. Can't we await the result of Legorjus's negotiations? There's no hurry to employ force. What do we want? To sacrifice 23 hostages? Mr Minister, I am totally against any offensive that puts the hostages' lives at risk. General, I take note of your reservations. The hostages' safety must be ensured, strategically, if we do intervene. So I'd ask you to take all necessary measures to keep bloodshed to a minimum. Thank you, Gentlemen. What do you think? It's like being at war. It's nice to see you guys from the 11th Shock, but I don't know why you're here. Me neither. It's a job for the GIGN. But if we go in, we'll do ours. From the info you just heard could you estimate the losses? Sure, I'll send it over. Captain, a word in private, please. Mr Minister. The Government won't talk to the FLNKS. I want you to end your initiatives. I've just begun, Kanak time is different to ours. Legorjus, let's stop playing this little game. What game, Sir? As you well know, France is caught in a bind between a right-wing government and a hostile left-wing president meaning usual procedure is not on. This hostage crisis began over a week ago and the last round of the elections is imminent. If we don't find a peaceful solution within hours, it'll be out of my hands. Words always take longer than weapons. You speak like a politician. I'm not waxing political, but the death of a human being is a failure for us. For me too, I assure you. Yet sometimes it's the only way to restore order and morality. New Army HQ - Village of St. Joseph 98814 Island of Ouvéa Tried to enrol the archbishop, but no go. What happened? Officially, a technical hitch with the radio. But he got the brush-off. It wasn't funny. Sorry, I'm not surprised. - So they let you out? - Yes. The atmosphere is more relaxed up there. Well, gotta get back. Coming? No, Pons won't let me. Damn. What do we say to Alphonse? Keep it positive. It's Philippe. Thanks. Hello, Philippe. Alphonse, I'm stuck in Nouméa, I've got work to do. I can't return, is that OK? What's up? You haven't been back for ages. I'm working on the FLNKS, it's not easy. They're not answering? No, it's the politicians, it's another world. But I'll find a way. I'm counting on you. Don't let us down. IS it the FLNKS? Don't give up. There must be a solution. D-Day minus 3 Journalists' Quarters Sofitel Hotel - 98800 Nouméa All you've been told is false. Alphonse and his men are not fanatics. Neither terrorists, nor cannibals. There was no massacre at the Gendarmerie, no beheadings, no rape, just a panic reaction, which they fully admit. Those who killed will give themselves up. But first, they must tell the nation of the legitimacy of their struggle. In front of a camera. We can film and ask what we like? Yes, but no trick questions. It'd unsettle them and I need to keep control. Coverage in case of an assault? No, to avoid one. TV pictures would suffice? They'd at least serve as proof. Proof of what? Of how they treat the hostages. These are not savages. Why commit yourself? Got the Stockholm Syndrome? I just want to show Alphonse the exit he's looking for. Just doing my job. OK, we're in. We'll send it to the hierarchy, see how they react. Philippe!! The estimated losses report. It's totally unacceptable. We've all decided to resign. We're drafting a letter, will you sign it? I can't, I got my men into this. I understand, Philippe. We're not abandoning you, but we have to make a stand. Brave of you, General. Your backup has arrived, in the mess. Thank you. Hi, Philippe. Finished preparing, ready to head for Ouvéa. I can't take you there. I didn't ask for backup, I've no mission for you. There's guard duty here, if you like. We didn't come 25,000 kilometres for that. You messed up, you'll need us for an assault. Know what that'd mean? 10 to 15 dead, not counting the Kanaks. A bloodbath, like to join in? We can make the difference. What difference? The 11th Shock are going in. They want to set an example. I'm not involving you guys. You're digging yourself into a hole. Captain, mission cancelled. I just got orders. I'm cutting the engines. D-Day minus 2 Mr Minister. Come in, Captain. Have a seat. You were bringing journalists to the cave without my authorisation? No, to the island, to await your go-ahead. Think I'm a fool, Captain? And your contacts with the President's office? They in no way change the substance of what we discussed, Sir. I feel you underestimate the consequences of your acts. We have received a collective threat of resignation. Are you part of this group? No, I stand by my men. Very good, Captain. We'll be needing you. For what? Are you opposed to an assault? No, barring other options. That's not for you to decide, Captain. The President has signed the order to attack. This is top secret. The order came too late to attack tonight. Operation Victor will begin tomorrow night, for an attack at dawn. And the journalists' visit? It was refused by the Prime Minister. That was part of my negotiations. I'd have got results. We want results before the elections end, the time for talking is over, Captain. And protecting the hostages? That's your responsibility. But I've no longer access to the cave... You have 24 hours to find a solution. Mr Minister, do you realise how many lives will be lost? You mean soldiers or Kanaks? - Both. - We accept that responsibility. What do I tell Alphonse? You promised journalists, no reason he shouldn't have them. Your helicopter will show the assault troops the exact location of the cave. In the end, your idea will have been of use. - Mr Minister... - Thank you, Captain. That'll be all. Mr Minister, General... Hello, a line for Paris, please. Those Kanaks are bloody stupid. Killing people with hatchets! Christian Prouteau for Philippe Legorjus. Christian, what's going on? The President signed the order to attack? He just informed me. What are you doing? I'd found a peaceful solution. I'd found a way out. I know. And you're stabbing me in the back. Philippe, calm down. Endangering the lives of your men. Are you ready for that? Hopefully, it'll work out. It makes no sense! I warned you, it's beyond our control. Chantal, it's me. Darling, how are you? I've waited days for your call. Sorry, I couldn't until now. What's going on? Were you in the cave? We heard of beheadings, errors, that you got taken hostage. No, it's not true. I'm fine, don't worry. All is well. And JM and the others? They're still in there. And how are you doing? Chantal... I've never felt this before. For the first time, I feel useless. You can't control it? No, I'm doing the opposite of why I'm here. I've never heard you talk like this. I've never experienced this before. There'll be an attack? Yes. Whatever you do, there'll be no going back. Think carefully, my love. I kiss you, I love you. Don't worry, it'll all work out. Hi, Philippe. Hi, guys. Didn't bring the backup from Nouméa? No, I gave them a mission on Grande-Terre. Why don't you use them? I don't want us part of an action I disapprove of. I know what I'm doing. We hope so, it's our friends in there. My friends too. How'll they protect themselves? I'll find a solution. We need to get weapons to them. I told you, I'll find a solution. Captain... There's a Kanak who wants to see you. Thank you. And apart from the co-op, what happened? The soldiers, as they were leaving they smashed everything. They stole money. One even shit in one of the huts. I'll see what I can do to compensate you. We don't want compensation, just that you take note of it. I understand. What are they doing? Preparing gifts for the liberation of the hostages. Alphonse wanted us ready for tomorrow. He wants it filmed by the TV. It'll soon be over, I hope it won't have been in vain. Everything all right? So? They brought us breakfast, it was delicious. Fish, the lot. You'll see, the gendarmes go where they like, everyone is more relaxed awaiting the journalists. Alphonse has written a text he wants to read them. There'll be no journalists. In the helicopter, only soldiers. The President signed the order to attack. What? I thought the talks were moving ahead. So did I. That's absurd. Journalists were the solution. Alphonse was to liberate the hostages. I'm up against a brick wall. Seems no one wants a peaceful outcome. And what about us? I must find a way to protect you. From the outside? No, from the inside. What's your plan? You smuggle arms to my men. Sorry? What are you saying? They no longer search you. They trust you. I can stash two guns on you. Are you kidding? No, we've no other choice. Philippe, I'm a magistrate. Do you know what that means? I haven't the right. I can't bear weapons. We're betraying Alphonse, having just won his trust. Exactly. And if you can't find a way to protect us? The assault will still go ahead. You mean they'd sacrifice the hostages? I mean it's been planned from the start. What have they got to gain? There are no witnesses here, no one will tell. If the gendarmes are killed they'll blame the Kanaks. It'll be the end of the FLNKS, of separatism. I don't believe it. Our politicians wouldn't do that. Jean, we're 25,000 kilometres from Paris, with no control over their decisions. All that matters is the election. We've no room for manoeuvre. The only way to avoid carnage is to stop Alphonse from doing the irreparable. He won't stop. You know he won't. It's betrayal. We were all betrayed. Well? It feels OK. It's holding. Well hidden. The key for the handcuffs. Good luck. Well, he's got balls. Ideal weather for an attack, Sir. When it rains, no sentries. But it's not raining in Paris. They don't give a damn if the weather is with us or not. Their priority is freeing the Lebanese hostages. Let's not spoil their party with our Kanaks. But tomorrow, if we free the hostages alive believe me, they'll use it in their favour. And if it's a massacre? We take the rap. - Doesn't that make you sick? - Yes, but so what? You ask too many questions. As an officer you agree to obey orders even if they go against your personal morality. Look at me, I'm a general. I have two stars a 30-year career and the power to decide who lives or dies. Yet when some politician tells me to jump, I jump. Like you will tomorrow. That's being a true soldier. Still sure you want to be a true soldier, Philippe? That's all you should ask yourself. Mr President, we, the Kanak people, demand our right to exist, to survive. We claim the right to independence, recognised by international law, of all colonised peoples. Our legitimate armed uprising has already spilled too much blood. We have bled for 135 years in silence and ignorance. This ignorance is slowly killing us. We wish to engage in dialogue with the French people to find solutions to our common problems. Together, let us cease this violence. The only way to silence it is through dialogue, respect, listening and humility. D-Day minus 1 I hope, Mr President, that together we will manage to restore justice. That of men. I beg you, Mr President to come sign the act of independence with us in Watete Cave. What do you think? It's powerful. When are you coming? Tomorrow morning, with the journalists, by helicopter. That's good, Philippe. We can speak to the French people at last. Alphonse, tomorrow you must remain calm and composed. Don't worry about me. And keep your men under control, you understand? Yes, I understand. I just want it all to end well. So do I. I wish it were already over. Until tomorrow, Alphonse. Till tomorrow, Philippe. Gentlemen... Operation Victor will begin this evening at 22:00 and take effect at 05:00 tomorrow morning. A commando unit of 75 men, led by Lt. Colonel Arthur, will approach the target from the east. Reconnoitred by the EPIGN, it will be made up of the 11th Shock Regiment, the Hubert Commando unit, the GIGN, and a flame-thrower from the 17th RGP. I also inform you that inside the cave two of our men are armed with revolvers. Gentlemen, Operation Victor should be the consecration of your many years of training. Your honour, and that of the French Army is at stake. I put my faith in you. I wish you the very best of luck. D-DAY May 5, 1988 Let's go! We're under fire. Forward! Don't fire! They're unarmed. Where? Forward? Yeah, let's go. Group UP- Take cover! Advance! Cover me up front. The 11th has already made contact. Let's go! Message received. Hubert are firing up the flame thrower. Firing up the flame thrower. Take cover! They've taken out the A52. Mathieu, forward! The pump actions are no good. Empty them. Empty the pumps! Hand weapons from here on in. Gentlemen... Simon, guys, keep in line. Simon, you advance on the left, we'll go up the middle. Armel, where are you? He's up ahead. Watch out! You advance on the right. Step on it, guys, let's go! Go ahead, give them back up. Keep moving. Marco, I want you to advance up the middle. Back-up, hold your fire! Wait for us. No, we gotta hurry, our guys are inside. I don't know what's going on, I need a visual, we advance. We're 25 metres from the cave, with the 11th on our backs! Advance! Go, Marco, go! Group UP- Fucking hell, Marco's hit! Look at me. Take care of Marco. EPIGN! EPIGN! Man down, shoulder wound! Request evacuation, over! EPIGN! Bring a stretcher. OK, Marco. Keep still. You'll be fine. At 11 o'clock! Straight ahead, 11 o'clock! We're under heavy fire. Time is running out. Simon, I want a visual of the hostages. No sight. They'll be slaughtered! Two Kanaks at 1 o'clock! Advance. Cover them, cover! Any sign of the hostages? No sign, zero visual. Don't look at the bodies, advance. Keep moving, we're good. Advance. Don't fire! It could be the hostages. Wasn't us. It was the Hubert and the 11th Shock. We don't look, we keep going. Come on, guys. Where's that fire from? Where's it coming from? It's the 11th, they're firing on us! They've fallen back. Mathieu, tell them we're here, in the crossfire. Panther GI, we've entered your zone. Please fire to the right, over. Armel, go! - Hit the deck! - No, we continue to move forward. Simon, advance! But we're under fire! No matter, get to the hostages. - Across a wall of fire! - Let's go! There's no point. There's no way in. Keep in line. Advance. Don't fire blind! Don't fire without a visual. Might be one of ours. Simon, got a visual? It's about 50 metres in that direction. 50 metres? We're already under heavy fire. Let's go! A guy with a bullet in the head. Free the hostages! Come out! Surrender now, I give you my word as an officer that you've nothing to fear. About ten Kanaks dead. Two from the 11th Shock. We've localised the cave. Intervene. Tell them to stop firing. I can't, I betrayed them. Make them see, it's over. And the hostages? Not sure about your guys, the others are in the cave. I've one last option. But I need time. Hold the second attack. Give me 20 minutes. I'll try to negotiate one last time. Hello, I'd like to talk to Franck Wahuzue. It's Philippe. Tell him I want to see him, in Lifou. I'll be at the football ground in 10 minutes. Thank you. Captain, they've launched the second attack. Find the hostages... Maintain your positions... Move! Down! On your knees! Stop! There are enough dead as it is. Drop your weapon. Back up! Move! Move! Move! Take me to the cave! My men... You promised me. Go ahead. Now I remember... The actions and reactions, the decisions taken. And though these memories are painful, this reality, difficult, I stand by what I did. Because if truth hurts, lies kill. Alphonse Dianou died on the way to Fayaoué Gendarmerie... The Army claims he died from his wounds. The assault on Ouvéa Cave left 19 Kanaks dead, zero wounded. The Army had 2 dead and 1 seriously wounded. Among the hostages, only 1 wounded, by friendly fire. 3 days later, Mitterrand was re-elected president. PM Michel Rocard, the FLNKS and the RPCR drew up the "Matignon Agreements" opening discussions on self-determination... And making provision for a general amnesty. A few days later, journalists contested the official version of events. A Human Rights League inquiry confirmed army brutality in the murder of Alphonse Dianou and 5 other Kanaks after the attack. One year later, during the commemoration for the 19 Ouvéa martyrs, Djubelli Wea, former Gossanah tribe pastor, assassinated Jean-Marie Tjibaou and Yeiwene Yeiwene, the two FLNKS leaders. Captain Legorjus left the command of the GIGN. Today, New Caledonia is still a French territory. As of 2014, the New Caledonian people are to vote by referendum on their independence.
