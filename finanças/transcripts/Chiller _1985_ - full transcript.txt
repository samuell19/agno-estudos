- Hayes? Is that you? - Hayes. Very funny. You're late. - Dead battery. How are the guests? - Same. That's what I love about them. Never complain. - They're saying they might try to bring one of them back. - Heh. Don't hold your breath. I've been hearing that ever since I've been here. See, the trick ain't freezing them. It's thawing them. So there they sit. All frozen to death. Waiting for some miracle cure. All paying that monthly rent. Biggest game in town. See ya. - Take her easy. - What's going on here? Oh my God. This is Hayes. Get me the supervisor, quick. Emergency. Sir, we've got a malfunction on one of Stricklin's cylinders. Number 59. I don't know how low. The alarm didn't go off. It's up 159. It's too late to put him in the back-up unit. He's thawing fast. - Rectory. No, he's asleep. It's after midnight. Couldn't you call back in the mor-- Oh! Oh yes, Mrs. Creighton. Just hold on one minute. Reverend Penny? - Reverend Penny? - Yes? I'm sorry to wake you. There's a call for you in the rectory. It's Mrs. Creighton. She says it's urgent. - Felix. Felix, here. I'm so glad you made it. - What is this? What's going on? - Felix. There is going to be a miracle, and I wanted you to be with me. - What are you talking about? - They're going to give my son back to me. - What? - Yes. - Marion-- he's been dead for almost 10 years. - No, Felix. Not dead. Asleep. - Asleep. - Yes. - I was there the night he died. I conducted the funeral. - Excuse me, Mrs. Creighton? - Yes? - Would you sign this for me? - What is it? - Consent for surgery. - Ah. - Right here, please. - Yes. - I don't understand. Consent for whom? - Her son. - Thank you. - Yes. - Is this our patient? - Mm-hmm. --Mass due to circumscribed lesion in the mid-portion of the liver. - Hm. --...is definitely involved. It's remarkable. He should actually be dead. - He is. - What? - Complete liver failure. Hepatic coma. We tried to transplant, but we couldn't stop the subsequent rejection. - Rejection? With cyclosporine? - We didn't have cyclosporine 10 years ago. - 10 years? Dr. Stricklin? - Yes? We're at minus 22. - Thank you. We're coming. - But Phil-- what's going on here? - When I knew it was hopeless, I told the patient's mother. She was devastated. She begged, pleaded with me to save him. I was helpless. - Go on. - Well, desperate people do desperate things. Are you familiar with cryonic suspension? - Well, I know what it is, but I've never-- Phil, do you mean to tell me that this guy is-- - Frozen. - Frozen? - It was her only alternative. Since we couldn't treat him at the time, his mother wanted to save him until we could. - And you're going to try and bring back? - We have no choice. The cylinder has failed. He's thawing. - But this is all theory. Nobody has ever done a retrieval. - Nobody ever had the chance. - Look, even if we could, we'd have to redo the transplant. We need a liver. - We have one. Glen, help me. This is the opportunity of a lifetime. - Wait a minute. Phil-- what if we fail? Have you considered the consequences? - What consequences? The patient's already dead. - Then, the funeral to bury him-- this was all a sham. - Yes. - Marion. All this time-- why didn't you tell someone? Why didn't you tell me? - I was afraid. It was such a radical thing to do. I didn't know how people would react or if they'd understand. Please-- Miles is my son. He's my life. He's all I have. - Mrs. Creighton? - Yes? - I'm Dr. Collier, the surgeon. - Where's Dr. Stricklin? - He's prepping right now. Look, Mrs. Creighton-- I don't know exactly what you've been told, but I just wanted to make sure you understand the reality of what we're dealing with here. Look-- I just want you to know, this is all very theoretical. - I have faith, doctor. God wouldn't have brought us this far to let us down. - Just so you know-- this is going to be a long night. - I've been waiting for 10 years. Felix-- I'm going to the chapel. - Doctor-- is this possible? Can you now restore life? - Some seem to think so. - What will it be? - I don't know, Reverend. - Maybe that's a question I should ask you. - Is he ready? - Scalpel. - Clear the way. - Suction. - Sutures. - Nice work. - All right. Clear. - Flat line. - Again. - Flat line. - Charge me. - Flat line. - Dammit. Again, again! - Clear. - Flat line. - Charge me again. Clear. - Felix-- This really is the age of miracles. Isn't it? - Yes. I'm sure it is. It's just that it's a different kind of miracle than I am trained to understand. - He's alive. Felix. Phil.. You wanted to see me? - Yes. Marion, please. - Thank you. - Well, thank you. - Marion, I've been conferring with Dr. Stricklin and Dr. Collier about your son. It's been six weeks and, well-- as you can see, there has been no improvement. We've gone over this report very, very carefully. What I'm about to suggest doesn't come without a great deal of soul-searching. - What? - Termination of the life support system. - You can't be serious. He's alive! - He's functioning, Mrs. Creighton. That's all. - Then, there is hope. - Marion, it was a desperate attempt and you knew it. There were no guarantees. - I don't understand. It was a miracle. You said so yourself. Now you're telling me that we failed? - What we have done is extraordinary. Apparently, it's not enough. - Then we do more. - There is no more. - There must be more! If it's a question of money, or equipment, or-- - We're not God, Marion. We can't give him the will to live. - So close. It's so close. We must have some more time. - Marion, please listen. - Listen to me. I-- want to hold onto him for a little while longer. Even if it's like this. - All right. - Thank you. - Cooper? Your turn to give 507 his massage. - Me? - I did it last night. - But he's so-- cold. - Gee, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just outside. I heard sounds, so I-- came in to see what's going on. - Would you check the patient for me, please? Just check the patient. - Hey, it looks like he's awake. Hey. - Check his eyes. Do they look normal to you? - Yeah. They look all right to me. - How're you doing? That was really-- - Dr. Collier-- - Mrs. Creighton. Oh-- come on. You're going to be very happy. Oh. Please excuse us. Excuse us. Pardon me. Excuse me, doctor. Whenever you're ready. - Congratulations. - Miles. - He's hungry. - Careful. Welcome home. My son. Oh. Look who's here, Miles. You remember Mr. Hanna? - It's a miracle, Mr. Miles. A miracle. I got a surprise for you. Guess who's still here? - Shut up! What's the matter with you? - I think we'd better go in the house. - Wonderful, Marion. Absolutely wonderful. - Let me get you some more. - Oh, no. Please. - Don't be bashful. We have plenty of prime rib. Miles loves it. - Marion, no. Please. I would love to, but I simply must not overdo it. - Hi, Marion. - Hello, Stacey. - Hi, Mr. Beeson. - Hello, Stacey. - Is there anything left for dinner? - Elizabeth has kept it hot in the kitchen. - Oh, thanks. Bye. - She has certainly grown into a lovely young woman. I remember when you had doubts about becoming her guardian. - Yes. She's been a godsend. I was so lonely without Miles. Excuse me. I think I'd better go up and check. - Marion, you just checked him. He will be fine for five more minutes. Clarence. It's so wonderful to have him back home again. - I know. I know. It's written all over your face. Well. Now-- what are your plans for him? - Well-- truthfully, that's why I asked you over. To tell you. I want him to return to the company. - Well, he should. - Really? - Absolutely. His father would have expected it. - Oh, Clarence. I am so happy that you feel that way. You've been such a help to me in managing things. I-- I was afraid that you might resent it. - Marion. It's his. And we need new blood in the company. - You're not going to leave? - No. Heavens, no. I will be right there peering over his shoulder, keeping an eye on everything. - Oh. Dessert? - You are determined, aren't you? - Yes. To you. - To Miles. - Miles? Miles? I, uh-- I just wanted to say goodnight, son. - Goodnight. - I-- I didn't want to disturb you. I-- I realize you have a lot of catching up to do. Your uh-- your mother tells me you're coming back to the company. - That's the plan. - Well, fine. That's fine. If there's anything I can do-- - You're still at the company? - Yes, of course. - And what exactly is it you do there, really? - What is it I-- Well, I-- I've been looking out for the family's interest ever since you-- while you've been gone. - But now, I'm back. - Good morning, dear. - Good morning, Marion. - Here, Hap. Hap? Come on, boy. Happy? Happy? Hap? Mr. Hanna. Where's Hap? - You better not go in there, Ms. Stacey. - What's wrong? - He's dead. - No. - Some animal got to him. - Miles? - So, in addition to last quarter's profits, we were up again by almost two points-- giving us a total for the year of 5 %. Now, including that with the last 9 years' profits, it gives us an overall annual average of 6 %. Ladies and gentlemen, that-- that's our report, and I think we all agree that we seriously can this is very, very good. Miles? - I think it's pitiful. What's this? Donation. Contribution. Burn center, county hospital. West Side Fellowship Church. Let's see. A dozen more. I ask you-- how can you justify this? - Well, Miles-- - Mr. Creighton, I'm sure we'd all like to see the company more profitable. - And you are? - Leigh Kenyon. - Advertising and PR, Miles. - But don't you agree that we also need some sort of service of the public image? - The marketplace is cold-blooded, Ms. Kenyon. It doesn't care. - I disagree. Most of the large corporations have a specific budget for charitable work. - Charity does not increase sales. It's non-profits. - Mr. Creighton-- you've been gone a long time. We've put a lot of effort in this company. We've come up with a plan that we feel is pretty successful. Now, if you have something to add to that, something to improve upon that plan-- I am sure we would all like to hear it. - Would you, now? Efficiency, Ms. Kenyon. Efficiency. I'm going to take a hard, concise look at everything around here. Whatever I find that isn't working, that's obsolete or useless to me-- I intend to eliminate. Do I make myself clear? Good. Are there any further comments? Good. Beeson-- you stay. - Morning. - I don't know what to do, I-- Hold on a sec. Mr. Beeson? Mr. Beeson, are you all right? - Yes, Yes. I-- I'm fine. Thank you. - He fired you? Of course, there must be some mistake. Miles would ne-- Yes. Of course. Of course, I'll talk to him. Yes. I still can't. Yes. All right. Yes, I will. Goodbye. - Miles. Miles, please. I've got to talk to you. - You're drunk. - Oh, no. No, no, no. I-- I've just had a couple. Miles, please don't do this. Miles, if-- if I've done something wrong, please tell me what it is. I'm sure we can straighten it out. Miles, I was your father's best friend. I helped found this company. Miles-- Miles, please give me a chance. Talk to me. Miles-- Miles, please. If you want to run the whole show, fine. I have no problem with that. Miles-- Miles, please. Just let me stay until the end of the year. Until retirement, that's all. Miles, please. Don't take-- Let me keep my dignity. - Dignity? Is that what you want? Well, come here and let's talk about it. - I can't. - Of course you can. - I can't. - Very well, then. - No, please-- I'm coming. Miles, wait. - Come on. - Yes, yes. - Hurry up, I've got things to do. Miles, wait. Wait, Miles. Miles. Please, wait. Miles-- I'll do anything. - Now where's your dignity? - Why are you doing this to me? - Simple. I don't need you anymore. - Miles? Miles? Miles? What's the matter? Son, are you all right? - Hi, mother. I'm just cold. - Why-- it's burning hot in here. Miles, what is the matter? I tried to reach you all day. Where were you? - Busy. - Clarence called me. He said that you had fired him. Why? - We don't need him. - We owe him. - For what? - For past services. - Mother, he was paid. - I don't mean that. I'm talking about his loyalty. About his friendship. - All right, mother. You tell me. What do you want me to do? - I want you to rehire Clarence. I want you to tell him it was all a mistake. - Certainly, mother. - You mean it? First thing tomorrow? - First thing tomorrow. - I knew you would. Good evening, Stacey. - Hi. - How was the party? - Fine. - Stacey-- Is anything the matter? - Nothing. It's just a little strange coming home and not having our dog here. We really miss him. Don't we, Miles? - Yes, we do Stacey. - That's what I heard, mother. One of the security guards found him early this morning. I'm sorry, too, mother. - Hold on a second. Yes? Ms. Kenyon to see you. - Send her in. Mother, I have to go now. I'll talk to you about it later. - My report. I just wanted to tell you how deeply sorry I am about Mr. Beeson. - Mm. So am I. - Yeah, I can tell. - It's very interesting. I'd like to read it and discuss it with you. - All right. - Over drinks. My friend. Well, I see that you've made it. - Sorry I'm late. I stopped by the funeral home. - What'll you have? - I don't know. What are you having? - Cognac. Keeps you warm. - No, thanks. A frozen daiquiri, please. - I read your report. Pretty good, actually. - I try. - I'm going to let you in on something. I'm about to make some changes in the company. Fill in the, uh-- recent vacancy. You're involved, Ms. Kenyon. - No. I'm not. Why? - I'm looking for someone who can work outside the office. Flexible hours, that sort of thing. - What exactly will this job entail? - It's a-- new position. It answers only to me. And the pay is quite handsome. - This position-- will it include stock options? - Certainly. - Choice of cars? - Whatever you want. - Better office? - I see you're interested. - Well, Mr. Creighton-- - Miles. - Miles, I-- I'd certainly like to discuss it with you further. - I have a room in this hotel. That's not. - Don't play Miss Indignant with me. You sell it just like the rest. It's only the price we haven't established yet. - Oh, yeah? Well, let me tell you what you can do with your job. - Room 817. - Do you even like me? - What's that got to do with it? - You win. - That's what it's all about. - Like you said. Business is cold-blooded. - This goes beyond business. This is pleasure. - Pleasure doesn't have to be cold-blooded. - But that's how I like it. Yes, Mrs? I don't understand this. Ms. Kenyon? - Yes? - Uh, I'm Reverend Penny. I'm here on behalf of the West Side Fellowship Church. We have received this pledge card, and I'm afraid there's been some mistake. - How so? - Well, it's been canceled. - There's no mistake. - I don't understand. The family has always been so generous. We've come to rely heavily on their gift to run the church. - I'm sorry, Reverend. The company has changed its policy. All donations have been terminated. - Is this the family's decision? - Miles Creighton's. - All right. I think I'd best speak to him. - You're wasting your time. He won't see you. That's why you were sent to me. I'm sorry, Reverend. I-- I wish there was something I can do, but-- I'm leaving. - Good Lord. Who did this to you? Have you called the authorities? - No! Please-- for God's sake, no. You don't know what he is. - Marion. - Felix. How are you? - Do you know about this? - Oh, it's our pledge. There must be some mistake. - No mistake. - I'm sure there is. I'll talk to Miles. - Have you been to the office? - No. Why? - They're all terrified. - Of what? - Miles. Miles? That's ridiculous. You know what he's like. - I know what he was like. He's not the same. - Felix, it's been 10 years. It's a new world. He has to adjust. - Do you know that he fired Clarence Beeson? - That was a mistake. - There's a young woman in his office who has been beaten up. That is no mistake. - Did she say it was Miles? - No. She hasn't admitted it. - Well then, you have no clue. - Marion-- she is scared to death. Open your eyes. - Felix, why are you doing this? Why are you trying to discredit him? - I am not trying to discredit him. I am trying to get you to see what is going on here. - It's the money. That's what it is. The money. - Marion. You can't believe that. I'm concerned about you. I'm concerned about Stacey. There is something wrong with Miles. - There is nothing wrong with him. Everyone has been amazed at his recovery. - At first, I was concerned. Now, I am frightened. - I lost my husband and my son. Everything I loved was taken from me. You've never been a parent, Felix. You don't know how terrible it is to outlive your children. But you have Stacey, Peter, and. - And Miles. He's my own flesh and blood. I brought him back. I gave him life a second time. He is my son. - I said, gin. - Huh? - Well, what's the matter? - Hm? - I've won more games off you tonight than I have for a whole year. - Hm. I'm sorry. - Can I help? - When a man dies-- what happens to his soul? - So that's the problem? Well, I wish you wouldn't work on this so we wouldn't playing cards. - Sorry. - Reverend? I'm sorry. - Yes. When a man dies-- what really happens to his soul? - Well, scripture tells us we pass on to the spiritual world. - But we don't really know that. Not in fact. - We don't know the specifics. But it's an act of faith. - Once, we had faith that the entire universe revolved around the Earth, but science changed that. - Well, science has never disputed the presence of a soul. - We believe that man is made up of body, mind, and spirit. Now, the body is physical. You can see it. You can touch it. But the spirit-- they believe that when someone dies, the soul goes off to paradise. To heaven. To some hereafter. Now, suppose that a man died. I mean, really died. Not, uh-- one of those near-death experiences. And suppose that, in fact, he was buried for 10 years. And after that time, somehow-- he was reanimated. Brought back to life. If the body and the mind functioned-- then he would technically be alive. But what about the soul? Would the soul be required to rejoin the body? Or would it remain on the other side? - I don't know. I never questioned it. I would hope the spirit would rejoin. Or you would have something cold, unemotional, without conscience or-- - A monster. - This isn't hypothetical. It's Miles Creighton-- isn't it? - I'm not sure-- but God help us if it's true. - Where are you going? - For a walk. - But it's so late. - Reverend Penny. It's been a long time. - Who are you? - I beg your pardon? - I recognize the face, the voice-- but you're not Miles Creighton. - Of course I am. Ask Marion. Who should know a son better than his own mother? - She's blinded by her love. - You're meddling, preacher. What do you want? - I know who you are. - That's not what you want to know. You want to know what's on the other side. - All right. Yes. If you are Miles Creighton, and you really have been called back-- then yes, you've seen to the other side. - And you want to know what's there. I'll tell you what's on the other side. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You die and there's simply darkness. - That can't be. - No streets of gold. No harps. No halos. No angels and saints. It's all here. So you better live it up, holy man. Make the most of the here and now, because that's all there is. - You're lying. - Why would I lie? Tell me. Why would I lie? Now you know. I don't care to ever see you again. Not at my house. Not with my mother. Not with any of us. You understand me? - Wait. Wait a minute. Wait! Wait-- Wait! Let me tell you something. You're a liar. What I believe is true. And will always be true. - Open this door! Miles-- stop. Stop! Miles! Oh, God-- Miles! Please! Stop the car! Don't do this! Ah! Stop the car! Miles, stop-- for God's sake! - Excuse me-- is this the Reverend Penny's room? - Yes, it is. I'm sorry. You can't go in there. - I'm Marion Creighton. Couldn't I look in now, just for a moment? - Well- you can observe him from here. What happened to him? We don't know. He's been unconscious since they brought him in. - Is-- he going to be all right? - It's too early to tell. - I'm sorry. You're going to have to to leave now. Please. - Marion-- - All right. All right. Just for a moment. - Felix-- how did this happen? - It was Miles. - No. - Marion-- I understand what happened to him. The body you reborned is empty. He has no soul. - No. - You're going to have to leave. Get a doctor, stat! Please. - Excuse me, Mrs. Creighton. We're still trying to piece this thing together. Did he say anything that can help us? - No. I-- I'm sorry, no. Dr. Stricklin. Dr. Stricklin. Stat. - Stacey, get off the phone! - Marion? Elizabeth? Dotty? Marion? Miles. I didn't think anyone was here. - Only me. - Where's Marion? - Out. - Where's Elizabeth and Dotty? - I gave them the night off. - Did Marion say when she would be back? - No, she didn't. - I should go upstairs and get cleaned up. - Are you frightened of me, Stacey? - No. - Good. There's no reason to be. Here. Come on. Sit down. - I don't have the time, Miles. - Get down, you-- You've got time for me. - No. - Well, go on. - I don't want any. - It'll warm you up. - I'm warm enough. - Suit yourself. - Don't. - You don't need this. - No, I don't-- please. - You are afraid of me, aren't you? - Yes. - Why? - You're different. - No, Stacey. I'm not different. - Yes, you are. - I'm not different, no. - Yes, you are. Don't, please. Miles! Mary! Miles! - It's all right. It's all right. Stacey, darling. I want you to go upstairs. But Marion-- It's going to be all right. I'll be there in just a few minutes. Go on up. Go on. - What are you looking at, mother? - I don't know. What am I looking at? I didn't want to believe it, Miles. But-- now this. I've got to do something. - Do what? Do what, mother? - Don't, Miles. The police will be looking for you. - The police? Why? - Felix Penny. - He's dead. - No. That's why I was at the hospital. He's there. And so are the police. - Did he tell them what happened? - No. He told me. I had to see for myself. - Mother? Mother? Mother, I know you think I won't come in there. Mother? Mother? No! No, mother! Mother! Open this door! Mother! No! Stacey, unlock the door. It's me. - Marion? Marion. - It's all right. I called the police. Everything is all right now. - Where is he? - Where he can't hurt you. - Marion, I was so scared. - Stacey. I'm so sorry. I've been a foolish old woman. Trying to live in the past instead of the present. No one can do that. I only have today. Darling, it's you. - I love you so much, Marion. - And I love you more than anything in the world. - There are the police. Stay here. I'll be back. He's there. In the freezer. - With a meat hook? - A gaffing hook. - Mr. Creighton? - Miles? - Mr. Creighton? - Is there a light in here? - Yes. Right over there on the wall. - Careful. - Good Lord. - What is it? - Get the coroner. No! - Stop, Miles! No! Miles, no! Miles. Miles. Ah! Oh. Felix. Is there anything I can get you? Anything at all? - Mrs. Creighton. - Tell me-- is he going to make it? - We've done everything we can. - If there is anything-- - He's getting the best of care. The rest is up to him. - There must be something we can do. - I wish there were. We're just not there yet. - Anything? - I'm sorry. - Mrs. Creighton-- You know, there is one thing you could do. You could pray. - Yes. - It's Hayes. Get me the supervisor, quick. We've got a malfunction.. There's 33-- 35-- Maybe more. I don't know. Tell Stricklin we've got a problem.
