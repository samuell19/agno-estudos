- ...I don't know. - He's planning something again. You know... A few days earlier I met him on the street with a girl. THE BRAIN Professor? With a girl? He was drunk. It's nothing. He said: Swanski, can you borrow me yours... What yours? What do you mean what? I lend it... Do you know what he returned? O Swanski, Swanski.... Additional conditions which, according to my research, may result in causing danger to the people. I find those necessary. Founding of an independent commission which supervises experiments, a guarantee of not giving the results to the military complex, avoiding any pressure on the scientists. Conducting experiments will depend on fulfilling my desires. They will not accept this. I didn't ask you for advice. I'm afraid for you. This can be the end of a career. They will not stop, they'll push you, they will blackmail. You're not making a decision just for yourself. What will be with us? Will you sign this, Swanski? Don't be afraid. I've watched a show of humanoids at professor Durchim's place. An excellent one. I'd never think it's a robot. What's with the boss? He's still refusing to cooperate? Yeah. We can't fulfill his stupid conditions. He needs to be scared. It wouldn't work. But we have a method for him. Jola! Jola, make me a coffee. I've met a brilliant girl, doctor Julia Oswald. Big, beautiful eyes. I have something for you. They accepted your conditions. I already thought it's over. Call Jola. How? You don't know? She's ill. You haven't visited her? Make me an appointment for the analysis. When? What was in the reactor, some...? Necessarily. Alarm. What's the diagnosis? The patient is dead. - Whose results are these? - Mine. You'd not believe me without some doubts. My name's Julia Oswald. Szop. ("a racoon") Compy likes to scare patients. Compy, check your circuits. You've made a mistake again. Let's see the documentation. Only a photo of a great frequency. This is new. There's no Drexler effect which occurs in all the living organisms. This light right to the palm. More than 1000 analyses and one mistake. As a souvenir. Compy, you didn't make a mistake when doing a photo of an electromagnetic field? Examination correct. Result correct. Why there's no shine on it? I told you that it felt good. There are no properties of living organism. But I'm talking to you. I too am talking to you and I'm only a robot. It's absurd. You're evil, Compy. Oswald was right. - What's this mathematical method? - Where? This girl does a pawn movement with her feet. It's a game, named hopscotch. - You don't know it? - No. I visited Jola in hospital. Hopeless condition. She's dissappearing. Doctors don't know why. You haven't noticed anything, professor? How can one sit so aimlessly? When I get nervous, my heart works badly, lungs too. I have amnesia. Typical for an old man. Right. - I made a photo yesterday. - Like this? This is new. We're influenced by something that destroys this fucking glow. The third congress. You presented the solution there. So, theoretically you can destroy the glow with the Goldman's radiation. We are radiated. Why are you happy? At last something rational. Reactor doesn't react. How so? Aren't we radiated? Hear it yourself. It's a joke. Detector is okay. But how? Give me a medical diagnostics unit. When did the main computer crash last time? For sure? Okay. Send me the complete info on doctor Julia Oswald. How it's not in the system? Thank you. Swanski. This was the generation of the twin computers. If one breaks down, second or third will turn off. Everything was fine for 5 years. Compy! You've made a mistake again. Durchim, is that you at last? No, it's me. How do you know this charlatan? Excuse me, Julia, why did you say that Compy makes the false results? This is not true. If only have you seen your face when you read the diagnosis. This had to be a mistake. Why is your data not at the institute? - You were checking me? - Yes. You don't blame me for their mess? Szop, what do you want? Careful, Szop! What are you doing? Why did you run her over? Who is she? I had to be sure that Julia was a robot. Brilliant example. She's still going. Although the hit was hard. Let's go to Dorchim. Only he messes with humanoids. I didn't know they were among us. He doesn't see us. It's one of his robots probably. If so, he might have eyes somewhere else. Every 15 seconds another move. Swanski, we have to be on time. - Hurry. - We going togheter? - I'll go first. I'll give you a sign. Now! Swanski. Swanski. Oh God... What now? Why make it harder? If it weren't for you... there would be no tragedy, explosion. Your people died. And your brain is copied in the computer memory. I turned it off from.... ...reality. This is a brave experiment. How can I work not knowing what happened? There is a noise, deformation of the program. It'll be interesting. Even Julia, my invention, will not clear your doubts. We'll repeat the procedure but it's nothing. You're living only in that machine. What are you doing, professor? What's happening? The computer has to be found. Oh God. My brain needs serotonin.
