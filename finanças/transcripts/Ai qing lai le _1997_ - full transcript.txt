I thought you'd turned invisible I'd imagine you visiting me Couldn't see you, but you could see me I'd tell you things only you would understand My parents died in a car crash in my sophomore year It was hard for me But you saw me through, my invisible friend After junior high school... ...the memory faded I don't know what really happened Maybe your family had to move I know you didn't really turn invisible But I still want to thank you for being my friend My invisible friend all through those hard years Remember what we agreed?
