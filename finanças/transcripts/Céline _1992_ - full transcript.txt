"The Pharaoh has just died." "His immortal form was placed in the great pyramid." "There he rests, with his back facing west," "in the nether world, but facing east," "ready for rebirth, like Osiris," "at the dawn of every day." "As he wills, he can board the Sun God's boat" "and sail up among the stars," "those imperishable nuggets of gold flaming in the sky." Roll up your sleeve. What are you tops at? Everything. But I prefer ancient history. What interests you so in Antiquity? People's lives 5,000 years ago. I'd really rather have lived then. Don't get up. All done! Something wrong? Come on, I'll take you home. - Come on! - My car... You can't drive in this condition. Where do you live? The Old Mill. Here, this will put you to sleep. "Self-made Millionaire Fran?ois Giraud Comes Home to Die". You're C?line? The adman's daughter? Dr. G?rard Chesnaud... Genevi?ve. It's urgent. "Giraud Estate. "I, C?line Giraud, renounce my heritage from my father, Fran?ois Giraud, "without following your advice to think it over." G?rard? Can you come to the Old Mill at once? Suicide attempt: Sleeping pills and drowning. No, just enough for a long sleep. Don't tell the police. I'll explain. See you. Attorney... 45-20-18-12. Mr. D'Havr?, please. It's about C?line Giraud. Know why she did this? - Old Giraud. - The millionaire? He took her in when she was born, 20 years ago, and forced her on his wife. Whose daughter is she? An employee's, who died in childbirth. Giraud recently learned he was critically ill. He said nothing. He came here, told her the whole story and died in her arms. It was such a shock that she renounced her inheritance. She stupid? When her fianc? heard about it, he ditched her. You informed the family? They're settling the estate. But the mother's coming. Right now she's in shock. It can last for days. She didn't swallow too much water, but she'd be better off in a hospital. I'll wait for her mother. Your patients? Patricia will fill in for me. Jumping into icy water with your bad heart! What's that girl got that put you in such a state? Remember 4 years ago? I wish someone had done as much for me. So, puss, your mistress is late and you're hungry. Here you go. This is Mrs. Houdrichon. Can you come at 6 a.m. Instead of 7? There's trouble at the farm I must see to. Please call me and confirm. I saw your door. Did you make it? Yes. It's easy, with... flooring. Flooring? Flooring and oak struts. It's pretty. I have one at home that needs re-doing. We can go have a look later. Fine. Is it expensive? It's the cheapest way. You use third- rate flooring, even if the wood has knots in it. Everything OK? She's no longer delirious. Lies there staring into space, without a word. I'll go see her. She's not alone. - Who's with her? - The mother. Mrs. Giraud. Genevi?ve Teissier. Hello, C?line. Feeling better? Don't worry, you'll be alright. Can we talk? Of course. Let's go outside, so as not to tire her. You're a visiting nurse? C?line will be better soon, but... she'll need someone with her. You're... divorced. With your heart you can't take hospital work. Would you live here, with her, as long as you judge needful? You can go on seeing your patients, but you won't have to. Not as long as you're tending to C?line. Help her return to school. I'll pay you well. We've left her this... property... and a life income. Nothing regal, but comfortable. That's all? I see you're informed. I raised her as best I could. She renounced her inheritance, after all. I can't... deprive my real children, for no reason. Did her fianc?, Olivier, really love her? Both families hoped for a lot from the marriage. But the current situation makes... the union pointless. Losing everything in 2 days, at 22, is rough. Less than at 50. I need you. Why'd you go and hide like that? It hurts. It keeps coming back... I've already seen you this way... And worse. None of it matters. Never be ashamed in front of me. I'm sinking... Help me. The first thing to do is to go back. - Go to bed. - No! Here. It'll calm you down. Stay there. Try to tell me? I'm scared to sleep. It keeps coming back! What does? My father, dying. He says I'm not his daughter. So I wonder who I am. I ask Olivier for help... and he drops me. I feel I no longer exist. I wish I were dead! Go lie down. When I sleep, I'm defenseless. What I gave you will black you out till tomorrow. You're sure? I don't want to think anymore. Hey, puss... She sleep with you? I once felt I was no one, and that I couldn't go on living. I tried to kill myself. Know what stopped me? The cat! I thought it might die, too, and that wasn't fair. So I called it off. Get up? I'll make the bed. Go on, take it... I never thought I'd enjoy life again. Know what was really weird? I used to think I alone was unhappy. And that pleased me, so I had to punish myself. Seeing my patients' distress changed me. I began seeing myself from outside. I saw my unhappiness was like everyone else's: Trite. My pride was hurt, but it helped me recover. You can lie down. It's sunny, let's go out. Olivier... I knew you'd come back! It's your mother who... I don't know what to call her... your mother, or Mrs. Giraud? Be precise. Mrs. Giraud sent over your things. You were in law school? Did you look after me? Now Mrs. Giraud is paying me for it. But do you want me around? That's for me. I gave this number to my important patients. Thank you. Listen... I'll call you back... You haven't progressed a bit. Can't concentrate? The hell with all that! All I know is, it hurts. Give me a pill. No sleeping pills, no tranquilizers. When you really want to get well, say so and I'll help. In another way. You haven't lunched? Help me. I'm going back to work. I'll do my rounds morning and evening. Afternoons I'll have office hours. Why not here? The house is big enough. If you like. You can help me. You'll get up at 6:30 a.m., wash, make your bed, do your room, correctly. We'll both go on a diet. I'll make lists and you'll do the errands. Can you cook? Not very well. Not at all, in fact. You'll learn. I'll set up my answering machine here, but I want you to take calls, receive patients and have them wait. You were going to help me. I'm your maid. You said you didn't want to be anything. Not even exist. There. Straightened your room? You're sure? What's up? I'm no use here, so I'm leaving. That what you want? Then do as I say, no questions asked, even if you don't know why. I want every daily action to become a habit. You can rest later. Come with me. Why are you so hard on me? Hurry up. Empty your mind. It's not easy. Calm down. Let the thoughts filter in. Try not to dwell on them. I can't. What are you thinking of? Same old thing. Meaning? My father's dying, he's in pain... By "My father" you mean Mr. Giraud? He's dead and buried. His body's nothing. It's an object, like a piece of wood. Eventually he'll just be dust. Stay here! Why the needless cruelty? It's not cruelty. The man's dead. He's no longer in pain. Only you are suffering. But the problem's inside you. I know that. But I can't help it. Talking about it relieves it a bit. Sit down here. Shut your eyes. Open your eyes. Stare at the candle flame. Close your eyes when you need to. Do your eyes still see the flame? Hang on to that image. If others appear, start over and recall the flame. That's life still beating softly within you. Bring your knees to your chest... Now do a shoulder stand. I don't know how. You learned it in school. Make yourself do it, go as vertical as you can. Lower your arms. Place your hands lower. As low as you can to hold yourself up. Now... Look at me. You sliding downhill? Sit down. Genevi?ve will be here in 10 minutes. Were these stones tombstones, cult objects, astronomical observatories? What did prehistoric man seek... in the stars? Vanished souls, as the Incas believed? Were these gigantic birds, or trails for astronaut gods through the Nazca desert? Still on Antiquity? Your friend better? Read this in your car... Please? "Beauties, you both walk pure, "Made so by this hideous, ungrateful world. You are sisters, you are virgins, "As candles on an altar burst into flame. "Your souls' flames are on your brows. "Beauties, I would like to see your round arms, your bosoms, "And your hips emerge from the white gauze. "Beauties, I would like to see your naked breasts, "Your charming, modest, innocent feet. "And I'd like to see your shoulders, beauties, "To see where your wings were." There you are, Miss! Up! Feel better? That's it! Don't squirm like that. That's it! Little Miss Softy, it's nearly over. You're OK, why the groans? Folks will think I'm torturing you. I won't be back before 9 p.m. Don't mess up my room. Big hug! It's late! This'll be cold now. You stink of the hospital. I was with a dying patient. I couldn't abandon him for you. What's that? It's for you. This too. - For me? - Yeah. Thanks. It's fabulous. Hello. Can the nurse see us? Today isn't a visiting day. I'll go see. Shit! Sorry. Come in. She'll be with you shortly. You see him often? Just on the run Not very romantic. It suits me. You in love? I like him. I've decided never to love anyone again. My husband left me for a girl who was no prettier, but more available. I went through hell. I felt that I'd ceased to exist... Like you. Then I developed heart trouble, and I blamed myself for all of it. I know... You told me. I felt totally miserable. I screwed any guy I ran into. A doctor advised me to take up relaxation exercises... yoga... Couldn't hurt... He also gave me phrases..."mantras"... to repeat for hours, to keep my mind busy... It finally calmed me down... That guy's the yoga doctor? Cute guy... Yeah, but the fire's gone now. I like him. And him? - What about him? - Does he love you? I think he's fond of me in his fashion. We love each other in our own way, most of the time. All my affairs up to 2 years ago, weren't very reassuring. It's true, I used to feel quite lonely at times. I don't know that you and I live together. But one day you'll tell me to leave. It's late! Look! Christ! I'll go first, I'm really late. I ran it for you. That's really sweet. Could you fix some tea, with toast and juice? Here... It's all ready! Anyone calls, I won't be back till 12:30. It's ready... Wake up! Not like that! Don't cut them, pull them out! Or they grow right back. Alright. I can see you've done it all your life! Grab it at the bottom, so the root comes with it. Hey, girls! It's Jacquot! - How's tricks? - Fine, and you? Fine... What are you up to? Gardening. We'd love to see a flick, but my car's in the garage. I'll take you. Really? What's he say? He'll take us to the movies... We'll eat out afterwards. What is it? Not by car. Let's go on our bikes. 20 miles by bike? You nuts? And Jacquot's a good friend. You know him! We're going by bike. Sorry, I don't know what's got into her. She won't go. Your pal's real picky. She wants us to bike there. Well, some other time. You're a pain. Go ahead... Drivers license, please. It's Jacquot's car! What do you want kid? I hurt myself playing with my buddies. Nurse coming soon? Not until 3 p.m. Could you dress my wound? It bled a lot. Come with me. You're fine. Nothing at all. Doesn't hurt? There neither? Let's see. You put me on. Look, there's nothing. I swear... I bled... Look, there's still blood there. You put me on. Run along. I swear, ma'am. Tell your pals you really fooled me. You scared me. Why are you in your nightshirt? Roland! Wait! Your legs moved... Try again! Try to walk. Get up! Try again. Once more... Go on... You can make it... There... You're walking. You're walking! Look... He had no bone marrow there. That's why he couldn't walk. How did he get it back? Don't ask me. This one's 2 years old... It's undeniable. You can see the part that's missing. What do you think? Nothing. I'm like you. I wonder how it regenerated. And when... Tell me what happened to you... If you promise not to tell anyone. First, I started to see lights... Then some kind of apparitions... Then I heard strange sounds... Once... I felt like I was being carried off... It scared me... Several other times... it was as if my spirit, or my soul, whatever, was a fire with huge flames that grew bigger and bigger. Then something odd happened: I was carried off to another world... and then I was united... United with what? Words can't describe it... Let's say, with God... But not the way we see God... I felt like I was melting... that my body no longer existed... It was sheer delight... I was as one with the whole universe... bathed in an immense feeling of Love. When I awoke, being alive was unpleasant... Everything here feels strange... I feel torn apart... I can get no help from the world I just left, nor from our world, that I no longer really belong to. That's when I feel great pain... and also a sense of total detachment. At first I was really scared. I couldn't feel her pulse. Her arms and legs were spread apart, and very stiff. You saw her levitate? I think I saw her levitate. It's hard to be sure in the dark. Why her? Could have happened to me? Remember when I was doing yoga? One day, while I was meditating, I suddenly felt I was floating over a huge dark void. It so terrified me that I stopped yoga. That's what did it? At the time, I thought you were sick of me and had found someone new. You gonna give me a hard time over that again? Forever? Forever? Certainly not! Let's not break up over such nonsense. Listen... Meanwhile, don't tell that to anyone. No one? No one. You could get into big trouble. Please forgive me... I saw the door was open, so I came in... My name is Lucien... I came to ask you to heal me, without much hope... because being like us, isn't really a sickness, I spent ten years in a monastery... I suffered, I prayed, I implored... The only answer I got was silence. Then I saw Him... there, right beside you! Please, miss... When He returns, ask Him, beg Him to... to come to my table... Will you ask Him? Will I ask who? You know who. He was there beside you, on your right. Silent... I recognized Him. He was real, more real than reality. You know that, Miss, you're a saint. Please pray for me. - Where are you going? - To the nurse. What do you want from her? My cat got hit by a car. You should take it to a vet. Alright, get in. Come with me. I'll see what I can do. Huh? No, I want to see the other lady. I'm the nurse. But she works miracles. What miracles? Yes, miracles. Miracles work faster and are less painful than nurses. Go on in. - What's your cat's name? - Pussy. - You have an appointment? - No. I don't really work today. Anyway, it wasn't you we wanted to see. Will the young lady see my son, touch him with her hand? We'll wait as long as necessary. I'll see what I can do. What matters to us, is to be here, close to her. Both of you, come with me. There! You should still take your cat to a vet. No, to the lady. Go on... Why can't I show her to the lady who works miracles? To heal her. My cat never harmed a soul! You know there's no such thing as miracles. Well, good-bye. You've got to deal with them. I can't do a thing for them. How do you know, try? We came in, do you mind? They won't leave. What can I do? I don't know... Put your hand on their heads... Improvise! What's your name? Shebashtien... - What's your name? - Germaine... - What's your name? - L?on. What's your name? - What's your name? - Antoine. There, they've all gone. Don't worry, they left happy. I think you actually made them feel well. I'm leaving. You can stay here as long as you like... Where are you going? To a place where no one will think of looking for me. Which is where? Why? Is it because of me? Because of them? In two weeks, you'll be forgotten. Leaving for long? A very long time? Not for good? Back in this world, I feel torn apart. You're insane. I suppose I can't make you change your mind... All of this is just pride. Will you see me to the station? So you're running out on me? You've got your patients, your life... You were my life. Will you see me off? You're really leaving? Will you come to the train? Honey, it's G?rard. You there or not? I'm back from my convention. What's going on, I can't reach you? I heard things aren't so good with your patients. You get in late or not at all. You hurt them. They're starting to complain. You may lose some. What's going on? Call me soon, honey, big kiss. My dear Genevi?ve, I've spent the last few months in a convent. At first, to hide. And I found my calling there. I'm totally dedicated to it: My acts, their consequences, my life, are no longer mine. I'm nothing. I obey. I'm completely happy. I prayed and my prayers were answered. All the unnatural happenings around me have ceased. I have taken my vows. The order is sending me to a mission house near the Chinese border. For a long time, maybe forever. When you receive this letter I will be far away. I've made a settlement for you: You'll get the deed in a few days. The "Old Mill" is now yours. I hope to help relieve this world of poverty. Farewell. Be happy. Thank you. C?line. Dr. G?rard Chesnaud isn't in. Please leave a message after the beep. I'm in terrible shape. Can you come at once? Or else pick up the cat tomorrow. Never be afraid again. It will come for us, for both of us... We'll never meet again. But I'll always be beside you. Until we leave together... at the appointed time. Then you'll see, you'll bathe in an ocean of Love and Well-being. You alright? I just got in, I heard your message. You really scared me... I was sure you were dead. So keep warm, stay in your bed. I'll be right there. Let me say this... I'll never leave you alone again. You want... to live at the "Old Mill". So let's live together there... Married for good, if you want. Yes... I've got lots of ideas that we must discuss together. I'll grab my car and be there in 20 minutes. Meanwhile, as I said, stay in bed. Just want to say I love you before I hang up.
