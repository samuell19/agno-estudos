Fresh easterly breeze, with snow... ...warming love... So, you'd time to come now? Yeah... Here I am. I really didn't think you'd come. Teachers aren't afraid of a bit of cold. I get the binoculars and map... ...but what's the camera for? That raincoat will be just great... ...in the cold! So, when you're up on this slope... If we go round this way, it's more rugged. All in all, I think this way would be best. I wasn't sure you were coming. I usually turn up. He always makes a mess of organising things. He sure does. Gunter... You and I can stick together. Crummy weather. Yeah. Probably be like the hunt, year before last. Rain alternating with snow... ...and damned cold. The Hunt You three... You cross the creek and continue northwards. On the other side, that is. And Ollie and I will continue on this side of the creek. But that wasn't the idea. We weren't supposed to split up. But there are two of us and three of you. And you've got the dog and the radio. But where are you headed for? We need to know where you're going.. Out there somewhere. It depends. Are you nervous? Don't be ridiculous! I shoot as soon as I hear a rustling in the bushes. I don't like it with a lot of people. I mean, you don't want to have TOO many. Know what I mean? Two's company. Three's a crowd. I'll have a look if there's anything to see. At times like this, we have to think things through. We'll need to take a detour... ...to get ahead. A detour with a helluva lot of snow. Up on the high ground, yeah. It's not so bad here... ....but we could be in for more It is a matter of thinking and calculating. You do what you're capable of. Around here somewhere. It's starting to get too dark. Too dark? Yes, it'll soon be too dark to go on. So we'll take it easy and stay here. Are you off-duty, Charles Olofsson? Well... I guess you could say I am... ...at a time like this. - Cheers. - A votre sante! What did you say? Gruss Gott! Oh, I see. Are you trying to sleep? There's a cabin not far from here. Where? Far? Not that far. At Silesjaure. Fishing's terrific there. Why didn't we go there? Well... ...it's locked. What does that matter? Then we'd have to be on the lookout. Haven't been out like this in 20 years.. Cold and hungry. I'm not really cut out for it. It's a great cabin... ...that one. A real fishing cabin. Some corporate heavyweights own it. Are you freezing, Charlie? We should've brought a radio. I've got a little transistor at home. Weighs next to nothing. Almost news time. Sounds like you've upset someone... A fox. What are you thinking of? Nothing in particular. Are you worried? I don't think so. A bit nervous, maybe? Do I seem to be? Gimme the coffee. Hey, Charlie... Can I ask you something? Why did you only want ME to go with you? Well... Do you remember... when we... ...you and I... ...were dragging for that guy... What the fuck was his name? Remember? Of course I do. And the girl who picked cloudberries. I knew where to find her... ...but it was only you who came with me. Yeah, I remember it, but why are you bringing it up? Coffee time. Best we save the grounds. Will it be shaving water as usual? I shan't bother shaving or brushing my teeth. I shan't bother cleaning my nails, either. Damned stupid keeping watch all night for no reason. You can't be sure. The cabin you talked about. Where is it? How far from here? Two kilometres, three kilometres? Is it the other side of the creek? A warm cabin. Have you lost your tongue? He must come here over the bog, on this side the lake. Why not just as likely on the other side? He has to come from over there. And he also has to come on this side of the lake. Why is that? It's the only possibility. There's an old path across the bog. It's no longer used. It's hidden by snow. But he'll follow it. I know it. If he comes now... If he does that... What the fuck are we gonna do? Well... I don't know. You don't know? Well... It depends. I don't know. Are we gonna spend all day in this damned bog-hole? Not all day. There he is! It's him. It must be him. Now! See that? He's trying, of course. Take this. Stand up! Stand up! I hit his leg. Is it him? - Yes. Are you sure? Still have any doubts? What's your name? What's your name? Go and get the gear, Ollie. Does it hurt? It's not too serious. They'll sew it up at the hospital outstation. We can go down to that cabin. He came on this side of the lake... ...like I said. He'll be OK by tomorrow. Is it much further? Just a short way. Hear that?. Just a short way... and we'll have a cabin. Come on! Well... Of course I know how to handle this sort of thing. Give me that. Open the shutters. So you're the one they're after. But they can't see anything in this weather. Well, now... Can you get yourself inside, lad? Let him move under his own steam. He could at least crawl. Does it hurt? Not too serious. Lie down. Pull it off. How are you doing? I do what I can. But I'm a cop, not a nurse. I'm sure he'll be OK. What's your name? Eh? He's lost his tongue. Turn over! Turn over. There's no way you could've escaped. My name's Olofsson. His name's Stensson. He's a primary school teacher. Where are you from? Where do you live? Why did you shoot? Why did you do it? Leave off, Charlie. It'll be dark soon, and I'm starving. - Are you off-duty, Charlie? - Well... Actually we're on duty, both of us.... ...you and I. Who would've believed it'd be so easy to take him? Don't you agree? The forest is now armed. Need knows no law. Cut it out! Up you get! You bastard, Ollie! Scared now, eh? You bastard! Not there! I hereby christen you Ollie. Like a cigarette? Can I borrow this from you for a curtain? What's the point of that? I can't stand a draught. It's like the worst-ever hotel here. There's a place set for you too. Don't you want it? You have to be hungry. Cheese sandwich? Bread, butter and cheese! I'm freezing. It's cold. I'm freezing. Of course... Because you're hungry. All he needs is a bit of heat. You off-duty? That's a matter of opinion. Cheers, then... or... ...whatever the fuck it's called. Cheers. Can I have some water? "Me thirsty." Are you from Stockholm? Tell me... What was your name, again? How old are you... ...anyway. Milk? Sour. At least a week old. Fully charged. Norwegian stuff. He's a primary school teacher. Unreadable writing. And nothing but blank pages. Listen... Can I see what's in his pockets? That's all he had. Nothing with his name? No driver's license. He travels incognito. The last drop of kerosene. Fuck... It'll be alright. I've got three candlesticks. I AM cut out for it. Really? Surely you could tell us your name. Or at least how old you are. It can't hurt. We have to save on coffee. This pot this evening... ...and a pot for early morning. It's no big deal to get him to talk... ...if you really want to. Well... It can't hurt to wait... ...till morning. My patience has no end. But then... Yeah. I guess we can handle a few shots. I guess we expected someone different. Whadda you mean? He's just a boy. Shooting... without reason... ...killing three people. Or four. Yes, it may be four. It's sure to be four by now.. It must be the fucking worst... ...to get shot in the stomach. It's incomprehensible. Incomprehensible. It's filthy weather, with more snow. He's asleep. He's asleep. No... He's not asleep. He's just pretending. Look at his throat, Ollie. - What about it? - He's swallowing. You never swallow when you're sleeping. But if you're awake... ...you can't help swallowing. It's a fact. You mean...? Wait. This is a nice lantern. It's empty. There's no wick. Those corporate heavies have some nice stuff. Shouldn't we get some sleep? Yeah... We can draw straws. And take turns sleeping. My turn first. Shall we make it 3 hours? It's a shame if he's freezing. Try and sleep for a bit. Such damned clever advice. At least relax. Just lying down rests you. What is it? Did you sleep? No... It's your turn now. The other guys... I wonder where they are now. Certainly not as far out as we are. Did we decide right... ...you and I? You did the deciding. Where are my boots? Go and lie down. I have to go outside. Go and lie down! Where are my boots? Go then, damn it! Aren't you finished? Well? What is it? Go and lie down. Didn't you hear me? Don't touch me! Why can't you calm down a bit, Ollie? Could we offer you a drop of coffee? I don't drink coffee. Cigarette then? Stop fucking around! Or how about a nightcap? You talk too much, Ollie. Our friend seems to be something of an ascetic. He's asleep. He's not swallowing. That one can sleep as much as he likes. Are you tired? Tired? Yeah. How can you tell?! We don't even know his name. Go and sleep, Charlie. At least try and relax. "Just lying down rests you." Why was it only me you wanted with you? You know what I think? I think you were afraid... ...and you're still afraid... ...of that guy over there. That goddamned... ...lunatic. He's scared too. He is. He's so damn scared that he shat himself out there on the bog. I'm starting to be scared of you, too... ...Ollie. And that's why you wanted me to come with you. One has to think things out, and figure them out. Correct? Can take a break now... ...primary school teacher? It's no big deal to get him to talk. It's really not all that necessary. Not right now, anyhow. Go to sleep, Charlie. We've a long way to go in the morning. You haven't slept. You mean, you noticed? You know what I think? You don't dare sleep. You don't just watch him... You watch me, too. Correct? Know what I think? Up there on the bog... the one who was the most afraid... ...wasn't me... ...and wasn't him. It was me? Are you saying I was scared of him... That guy? Listen... What I mean is... ...that I don't think you appreciate... ...that I'm the one who's responsible here... ...and not you! You mean that it's you who makes the decisions. I don't like violence. I never have. That maniac. The mass-murderer. There he lies. It was no big deal to take him. So why take a goddamned primary school teacher with you...? Who was of no use to you! You regret bringing me. You just don't want to say it. The wind's died. It stopped hours ago. Want some? I don't drink coffee. Forget it, then. You should eat something. We've got a way to go, today. Not me. I'm staying here. You'll be coming, I assure you. We'll rig a crutch up for you. Well... Time we got things organised... ...and got on our way. Hear me? Get dressed. Start with your shoes. How's your leg feel? Don't touch me! Take it easy, Ollie! Give me that bar. I won't stand for any fighting. - He's crazy! - That's why. Give it to me. Pack up. So, old chap... what's next? I'm staying. Like hell you are! You're coming. Going to carry me? One of us can go for help. The other stays here. And watch for 24 hours? I can stay... ...if you're tired. Mind his boots. Would the boots be enough? His socks! His shirt. Get the fuck off me! Was that necessary? You goddamn... Get the fuck off me! The blankets. The rug, too. There's firewood in the shed. Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
