Why are you standing here? I don't need security, but this place does. Everything is under control, Roy? Sir, we are at India's safest place. You are fooling us! -Thrash him! -Thrash him! My son... my dear child. Stupid! He troubles his own child. And loves the car more than me. -Come here! -Yes. Did you bring the brake oil? -I forgot, papa. -You forgot my son's food! -Dad... -Not papa, it's "Dad." -Yes, papa... -Call me "Dad." -Yes, Dad. -Don't overdo it! Why are you quiet? Can't you speak? -I can, Dad. -You are arguing with me! Sorry, Dad. You make a mistake and then apologize! Next time I will apologize first. That means you will make a mistake later! Useless! Bring the brake oil today! Hurry up! -Don't enter this house again! -Papa. Say "Dad", you scoundrel. You scoundrels! Wake up! KARTAAR HOUSE I am fed up of them. They don't do any work and come late as well. Neither do they sleep, nor do they let me sleep. First, they were three, and now there are four hooligans in this house. Who is it? Your pizza, ma'am. Take this. For the past two months I have been asking for the rent... but they have not paid it. Today, I will make them pay for it! Oh, no! Open the door! Open the door. Aunt, the door is open. Stop this nonsense! Tell me where my pizza is! Aunt, what is a pizza? What are you talking about? I am clueless. I will slap you! Aunt, mouse! Where is the mouse? Hey, you... Hey, tell me, where is my pizza? Oh, God! Where is the cockroach? It ran away. Where is my pizza? We don't know, aunt. I swear on you. Don't swear on me! Why are you laughing? Shameless! Useless! You will never change. You will never change. -What are you hiding? -Nothing, aunt. Show me your hand. Your pizza. Oh really, papa! You don't even pay me the rent and you started stealing as well. Aren't you ashamed? Who will pay me the rent of two months? The one who will pay, he will step forward. Manav, you will pay me the money. How can I pay the money? Then, why did you come forward? When did I... Who will pay me my money? I will pay you the money! -Give her the money! -Which money? The money that I had saved for my sister's cancer operation. But, Adi, we are already short of 10,000 rupees... if we give that money to aunt, then your sister will die. Let her die! That's in her fate. Lord, my sister is coming to you and this woman is responsible for it. Enough, stop crying. And Manav, come with me. -Go, Manav. -Go, you scoundrel. Go... Don't cry. Your sister will be fine. I am not crying for that, aunt. Then, why are you crying? Adi never told me that we have a sister... and that she has cancer. -What? -Yes. You can enter this house only when you pay the rent! Shameless, go and look for work! We will have to look for work. -I found it. -What? -I found a job. -This dead man will give us jobs. -But he can give us money! -How is that? Manav, bring that painting where the horse is eating the grass. Go and get it. Be quick. And I have a mind-blowing idea. Where is the food? Ask them. -Was Mr. Trivedi your relative? -No. -Was he your friend? -No. -Was he your neighbor? -No. -Then why are you crying? -My foot! My foot... Oh my, god. Tell me, I am Mr. Trivedi's son. I have come to handover your father's memorabilia to you. Really? Some days ago, your father had come to our art gallery, and he liked this painting worth 20,000 rupees. He has given 1,000 rupees and he had asked to collect the remaining money... -on delivery of the painting. -Yes. That's strange. He didn't like paintings. -Did he want to die? -No. But still he did die. Sometimes, people do some things... which they are never interested in. Let it be. Please pay us. It will give solace to uncle's wandering soul. I don't know where it is. For papa's... Our money. This is twenty... -Here. -Hold this. Give 1,000 rupees for good luck. Greetings. Why don't you see the painting? Stop! Don't ask for discount now! -What is this? -It is a painting. What is this painting of? -Horse eating grass. -Really! Where is the grass? The horse ate up the grass. Then, where is the horse? Why will the horse wait after eating the grass? -He left, isn't it, brothers? -Yes, you are right. -Left. -The horse left, now we'll leave too. -Bye. -Bye. Thank you. Don't worry about anything. Once the grass grows back... the horse will come back. The grass will... Look, look my heart is beating Look, look it is saying to you Come on baby, let's have fun Fun!

What are you saying? We will have to pay the rent to aunt. Come on, give me the money. We spent it all. What will we do now? I have an idea. The next theft, I will do it. -Not you! -Hey, wait! We will go and bring it! Yes. I am Mr. Sameer Agarwal. I am inspector Kulkarni, from crime branch. The four people who murdered your father... the police suspects that they are the members of Pasha gang. Mr. Agarwal was murdered at 9 o'clock in the evening... but he had left home at 6 o'clock. Can you tell me why he had gone out? We want to meet Mr. Agarwal. What work do you have? He was saying on the phone... I can give 50,000 rupees now. So, he had given the money to you? Do you have a doubt? I remember. Papa said a phrase on the phone. He was saying that if the horse befriends the hay then, what will he eat? I think someone was blackmailing Mr. Agarwal. I think that the "horse" and "hay" were their code words. -Go and tell sir. -Yes. Seems like you have quite a good acquaintance with Mr. Agarwal. That's how we work. We need to keep contact with influential people. Hurry up, we don't have time. Are we insane? Hurry up! Why are you in a hurry? Let me see that painting. Why? Who are you? -He was asking! -He was asking! Come on, show me the painting. Hurry up! -Here. -It is upside down. The horse was lying down. Horse and grass! -Arrest them! -What are you doing? Now I will never attend anyone's condolence meeting. There won't be a need for it because people will attend our condolence meeting. Peter, did you recognize, this is Kulkarni sir's favorite road. Yes, the last time Tiku Tarzan was encountered here. I had seen it. Pistol in the hand, and the button of the shirt was open. As soon as the van stopped and he made Tiku Tarzan get down... he understood that he is going to die for sure. Sir does the right thing. He abducts him... and encounter. Do you know Mr. Kulkarni's score? What is the score? He needs four more to complete half a century. -Four? -What are you saying? No! I don't want to die! -Quiet. -I don't want to die. What? You have found out about Agarwal's murderer. Yes, sir. But, sir, the four of them... Yes, sir. The van... here. Today he will complete half a century. Open them. Stop! Come on, hurry up. -Come on, get down! -No! Come on, get down! -No, sir, we didn't do anything. -I know that. Please spare us. Don't talk about sparing us. Sir, please take us to the prison. Please give us life imprisonment. Get them all out! No! I don't want to get down. Please sir. Complete your half century some other time. Quick! Quick! You all are free. No! Sir, you will shoot us from behind, won't you? Can't I shoot you from here? Please, sir, please forgive us. Please forgive us, sir. We don't want to die. I can't die at such a tender age. -Hey! -We are your children, sir! He is gone. We are safe! -We are safe! -We are safe! Come on. Come on. There is no one in the car. Now if the car drives without the driver then, it will surely meet with an accident. There he is. Come on. We should take him to the hospital. I... I... I know that my end is near. Nothing will happen to you. -We will call for the ambulance, you... -There is no use. Listen carefully to what I am saying right now. Have you seen Goa? No, sir. Are you a travel agent? Go and bring water. Look, I don't have much time. In Goa, in St. Sebastian garden, below a big "W"... below a big "W", there are 10,00,00,000 rupees. -10,00,00,000 rupees! -10,00,00,000 rupees! 10,00,00,000 rupees! Yes... it is my life's earnings. But why... are you telling all this to us? Because... you look like good people. In today's world, no one comes forward to help someone. Anyway, all that money is useless for me. Take the money... divide it amongst yourselves... then the entire world will be at your feet. The entire world will respect you. Fulfill your dreams... with that money. And live your life like the kings. Like the kings... He is dead. Yes, and while dying he played a prank on us. Joke! A dying man... never lies! -No! No! -A dying man... never... Dead. Water. He is dead. What was he saying about Goa? Uncle was saying that there is a St. Sebastian garden in Goa... and he has hidden a 10,00,00,000 rupees below a "W". We have to go get the money. Why should we take it out? Are we his servants? 10,00,00,000 rupees! 10,00,00,000 rupees! We are millionaires! 10,00,00,000 rupees! 10,00,00,000 rupees! Are we going to play a game? Don't tell the police about St. Sebastian garden. And, what about the 10,00,00,000 rupees? Move! You escaped again. Who saw the dead body first? -Who saw the dead body first? -No one. What do you mean? I mean, when we reached here, he was still alive. -What do you mean? -He was just about to die. What do you mean? He was breathing his last breath. But he died right then. Come on. Stand in a queue. Now tell me, was he alive or dead? He was alive... He was partially alive. Did he say anything before dying? Did he give any information? He was saying something, but I didn't understand. But I did. -Constable. -Yes, sir. Take them to the police station. But sir, we... Come on! Hurry up. Sir, the boss is dead. What will you tell the commissioner? I was thinking about the same thing. Look for the dead body. Hey, get into the jeep. Come on. What are you doing? Get into the jeep. Why are we escaping? Or else, the inspector would have found out everything. He has a jeep, he can catch us in two minutes. He cannot do that because detective Roy has brought his jeep keys along. Whose keys are these? Sir, they took along my house keys as well. Not just the keys... they have fled with the secret to the chit fund fraud. I have been after this for the past ten years. We have 205 rupees in hand. Now only one person can go to Goa. I will go and get the money. -Wait. -What happened? Has the doctor restricted me from going to Goa? Either all of us will go or none of us will. Do whatever you want, but I want to go to the toilet. -Quiet! -Keep quiet! That inspector is after us. What if he nabs us? We have to reach Goa as soon as possible. If all of us want to go to Goa together... there is only one way out. My dad will kill me if I touch his car! That's not possible. By the time your father gets to know about it, we will be in Goa, right? You will have the money and he won't be able to do anything. -Right, Adi? -Yes! But... But... listen... Let's go. Go to the car and we'll get the keys. -Okay. -Come on. Where are you going? You're coming with me! Key... that's the key. No! Manav, hold this screwdriver. The car is right there. I am holding the screwdriver. Take a look at where it is! Let it be. -I can't even abuse you. -Why? Who is it? Hey... who is it? Why are you mimicking the sound of a telephone? You fool, the telephone is dead from the past two days. -I will not spare you. -No, Dad! Don't beat me! -Come out! Come on! -No, Dad! -You think I am a fool! -I made a mistake! How dare you come here! You were here to steal the car! -What did you do? -He is unconscious. Take the keys. I am here as well, brother. Kamble, until they are found you will not move from the airport. Appoint 25 more men at the railway station. I want all four of them under any condition! Until the four of them are caught... you will guard the place. Where can they go? You have maintained the car well. It doesn't belong to him. Come on. Boman, catch him. You don't know how to drive. -Why did you stop the car? -Look over there. According to me, inspector has setup this barricade for us. So... what should we do now? That's not a problem. I know a route that goes through the jungle and meets the highway up ahead. Turn the car. Turn the car, come on. You banged the car! Dad will not spare me! I was trying to save the bear, that's why I banged the car. You broke both the headlights! It will cost 18,000 rupees. Why are you crying? We will give you 6,000 rupees each. -Just a minute, which three. -We three. And Manav? We are not different, we are one since childhood. -We are brothers since childhood. -Yes. What do you mean? -My father will kill me! -I am telling the truth. Just a minute. We three will pay 6,000 rupees each for the light. -Let it be! -Why? We will have to spend the entire night in the car. We won't have to. I have an idea. Here I take the matches, light the fire... And the light... When I tried, all were burning. -Get it! -Close the door! Close it! I have another idea. Let us sleep here tonight. How did the boss die? -When did it happen? -Yesterday evening, sir. It happened yesterday evening, and you are telling me today! But... What were you doing until now? Sir, I was trying to call you but I couldn't reach you. How did all this happen? Maybe there is a problem in your network. There is no problem in my network There is problem in your work! It was so important for us to catch the boss alive. We have lost it! We have lost the information! I was going to be promoted because of the same. You have ruined everything! I am at a loss, sir. For the past ten years... you stopped my promotion as well. You care about the promotion! The promotion! I was after him for the past ten years. Not you, sir, me. -Who appointed you? -You did. You will have to go. Now you will have to go to Yavatmal. Where is Yavatmal? You will know it once you reach there. You will get it by tomorrow. What is this? You will get your transfer order by tomorrow. This is what I get for doing my duty honestly for ten years. Who are you? I am Nari. Yes. But you look like a man. Contractor! My name is Nari Contractor. My stupid son, ran away with my sweetheart. I have come to lodge a complaint for that. -But this is a car. -It is a sweetheart for me. And this is my son, Boman... who has stolen my car along with is three scoundrel friends. See... -Is he your son? -Yes. -And he has stolen your car. -He has stolen my sweetheart. What are you singing? The moving thing is called a car What will we do now? We will have to make the car jump. You will make the car jump. Have you gone mad? Let us go back to the highway, If we go back, then the inspector and your father will catch us. And if we cross this, then we will be rich. But... My calculation is absolutely perfect. How? This broken portion will be approximately nine feet. If we drive the car at 81 kilometers per hour... if we make it jump at a 45-degree angle, the car will cross the other side. I will demonstrate it right now. This is the car. This is the speed. And this is the angle. Now the distance is 20 feet, so, the speed will be 120 kilometers. You both have gone mad! You are talking nonsense! The car cannot go there. But... What a jump! Your calculation was right. The car is banged up. Boman, my brother... Listen... But listen to us... Why are you getting so angry? Scoundrels! My car got ruined because of you all. This is my father's car and not yours! My papa will kill me! Stop it. We were giving you 6,000 rupees each. Add another 5,000 rupees to it. Only the mudguard is banged up. You are reacting as if... As if your car blew up. Boman, no one can stop it. Your car was half dead... and it finally blew up. Don't worry. Don't worry. Your dad will die seeing the car. The car passed from here last night at 1 o'clock. STOP I have not moved from here since last night. This car didn't pass through here. They passed through the toll, but didn't reach here then, where did they go? There is a path that meets the highway up ahead. That's it! Left. Adi, where have you brought us? Believe me, I know all the shortcuts of Goa. Which shortcut is this? Once we cross around 60,000 trees four rivers... You are counting the trees, aren't you? You are counting the trees... Keep quiet. I didn't do it. What? What are you doing? Tying my shoelaces so that I can run fast. Do you think you can run faster than the lion? Have you gone mad? Who wants to run faster than the lion? I want to run faster than the three of you. Don't come behind me. -This is a broken bridge. -Yes. My son! My son! My son! Those scoundrels killed my son! My son! My son! I swear on your engine oil... I will seek out those scoundrels! And I will feed them to the crows. Yes. When will we come to the road? The road won't come, we have to walk towards the road. Here it is. -What, has the road come? -No, it's the dead end. Don't try to run. The bullet of my revolver is faster than you. Why did you think that we were trying to run? I was guessing. Did you think you could fool me? Sir, you are misunderstanding us... Our friend fell ill. That's why we ran away from there. But I had asked you to go to the police station. Are we your servants to agree to your orders? He was saying that, not me. Tell me, which one of you wants to die first? Are you in a hurry to die? Then, why did you come forward? When did I come in the front? I don't know, in such dangerous situations, how I always come forward. You will have all the time to think about it after you are dead. Look, please don't shoot. We will go wherever you want us to. We will go to our house, we will go to hell... we will go to the police station. Please forgive me! Please forgive us. We are not even married. What are you doing? Here I am. Even I have seen Sholay a lot of times. It is not your fault that he has seen Sholay. Enough, get ready to die. I am still not ready. Why don't you start from there? Until then, I will be ready. Every father has a father. Yes. And we call him grandfather. You were threatening us of death. We play with death every day. Let us play the game of death today. -There is a bullet in it. -I know. Roy, there is really a bullet in it. He will die. I know there is a bullet in it. You are safe. Now it is my turn. No! Roy, there is a bullet in it! Stop right there. This game of death is between the inspector and detective Roy. You will die! Enough. What did Bose say before dying? Subhash Chandra Bose said... "You give me blood and I will give you freedom." Victory to India. I will tell you! Have you gone mad? I value my life. I will tell you. Before dying, Bose said that he has hidden 10,00,00,000 rupees in Chiplun, 40 feet away from the main square and four feet under the tree. You cheaters, deceivers! You lied to me! You told me that before dying, the man said... that he has hidden 10,00,00,000 rupees in St. Sebastian garden under some "W" in Goa! You are not worthy of being called friends. -Enough, Manav. -Why? I have a proposal. We can distribute that money amongst ourselves. If you will give the entire money to the government, what will you get? I never got any reward after being loyal for ten years. Transfer to Yavatmal. That's why, I will take the money... -and not the government. -What? One more thing? You play the game of death every day, don't you? Let's have a game with me as well. -Hey, where are you going? -Hey, don't move. Manav, why are you laughing? That inspector is so stupid. He tied our necks, he tied our hands... but he didn't tie our legs. Come on, let's go to Goa. Hey! Have you gone mad? Stand straight. -Or the four of us will die. -All four? Of course! The noose around your neck has been crossed around the tree and is in Boman's neck. And the noose that's around my neck is been crossed around the tree and is in Roy's neck. If anyone of us moves, then we all will die. Adi, keep quiet! Especially don't talk to Manav. All this has happened because of him. What did I do? You told everything and he hung us here. What did you do when you had the gun in your hand? "I will play the game of death." Now we are all stuck. I was just... If you will keep arguing like this, then I am leaving. Don't move! Don't move! Don't move! Don't move from there! I will think of something. Yes, please think. Think something for me as well. -Cheetah. -Cheetah! -Cheetah! -Cheetah. Cheetah! Look, he is slowly growing bigger in size. He is not growing up. He is coming closer. Lord! Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord! Why am I sweating so much? He is not sweating. He peed his pants. Move! Move! I will thrash you! Don't move! Don't move! Now you are just drenched, if you move... then you become dirty as well. If we survive from here, I will murder you. Stop your nonsense! The cheetah is coming closer. -Scare him away. -How? -Imitate the voice of a lion. -Yes. Are you scaring him or inviting him? -Imitate the voice of a lion. -Yes. He ran away. Baban, he ran away. Manav, don't move, or all of us will die. Something has gone in my pants. It is tickling me. Don't move, or all of us will die. We are safe! We are safe! We are safe! Untie it. We are safe! Hey, save us. Careful. That scoundrel inspector must have gone quite far by now. No, he won't have gone very far. How do you know? Because when I had fallen unconscious, then... According to my calculation... that inspector might not have gone far. It will take at least 15 minutes. Until then, have some tea. -Hurry up. -Right now, sir. You are not a hero but a villain Didn't I tell you that the inspector didn't go far? I have a very good idea. Let us flee with the inspector's car. If we have the car, then what is the need to flee? If this time the inspector catches us then he will hang us in a different way. And before he can hang us again... we should take care of him. HOTEL KAILASH Yes. Yes. Where is Pasha? Yes, the man that came in that car. In this jeep? Yes, he is a very dangerous criminal. And he poses as an inspector. He first tried to kill us, and then fled with the jeep. What are you saying? Tried to kill us, and then fled without jeep. What? Tried to kill us, and then fled without jeep. What? I have already said it twice. Are you deaf? There is also a reward on him. -How much? -15,00,000 rupees. 15,00,000 rupees. -15,00,000 rupees. -15,00,000 rupees! -Careful. -What are you saying? That's right. And whoever helps us in catching him, he will get a reward of 15,00,000 rupees from the government. I will get the money. I will catch him! I will catch him! So, you survived. We survived, Pasha, but you cannot escape the law, Pasha. -Pasha? Who is Pasha? -You are Pasha. -I am Pasha? -He said that he is Pasha. Yes. What is wrong? Brother Pasha, when did you return from Dubai? I am not Pasha! I am not Pasha! Brother Pasha, inspector Adi is searching for you. Inspector Adi! Oh, God, Inspector Roy! Run! I will catch you and take you to the police station. I will get the money! Catch him! Catch him. Don't let him escape. HOTEL KAILASH HOTEL KAILASH Your mobile. -Stop right there, or else... -Or else? -Or else... -What? We will press the send button and all the information about the money will reach commissioner Chaturvedi. -We have typed the complete message. -Yes. -We just need to press it. -The button. But in that way, you won't get anything. I don't care if we don't get the money. But we won't let you get it as well. Stop there. My fingers move faster than your legs. Stop right there, inspector. There is no network in this. Got it! I got the network. I understood. Look, I have a solution for it. 80% for us, and 20% for you. -Really? -Yes. Do you agree or should I send the message? Give me the phone. I will send the message. If I wanted only 20%, I wouldn't be compromising with you all. I would have told the government about the money and then I would have received 20% officially. And then I would get a medal and an interview in the papers and television. Should I send the message? No. I have another solution. 60% for us and 40% for you. Don't create trouble for us. Leave something for us. -60% for you and 40% for me. -Right. According to that, how much will I get? 1,50,00,000 rupees. -How is that? -What do you mean? How much is 60% of 10,00,00,000 rupees? 6,00,00,000 rupees, right? And how much is one fourth of 6,00,00,000 rupees? 1,50,00,000 rupees. Why is it divided into four? Three of us and he is the fourth one. Both of you are the same unit. But actually... What do you mean? Last night you said that you two are the same unit. According to that, we will divide the money among three. That's not right. Really? Why do your rules change while accepting the money? While paying the money, both of you were a unit. And now, when you're going to get the money, you're two different beings. The money will be divided between Boman, me and the both of you. -How much money will I get? -Quiet! 1,00,00,000 rupees! That's all. Each of us will get 1,50,00,000 rupees. We will not take a penny less. -Are you being stubborn? -Yes, I am. What do you mean? Give me the phone, I will send the message to the commissioner. Just a minute. Why are you calling him? Listen to me, it's better to divide the money equally. -Hurry up. -How much money will I get? Each of you will get 1,50,00,000 rupees. And you can't disagree! Okay, then I want 9,47,000 for my dad's car! -But... -No buts! This will be given to me apart from the share that I am supposed to get. -Okay, keep it. -What do you mean? Boman, when your father kicked you out of the house... I took care of you. That adds up to a good amount. If you are adding that, then add the money that I spent on your merriment. You are so cheap. You have shown your true colors. You are not behaving classy either. You are the son of a cheapskate. You called me the son of a cheapskate! You pushed me! Why are you fighting? -To hell with friendship! -Yes, to hell with friendship! Hit him, Manav! Hit him! Not me, hit him! You foolish boxer, can't you see! What are you doing? -Be calm and decide! -It has been decided! The one who reaches Goa first, will get the money. How can you reach Goa? Will you fly? You don't even have a car now. Don't talk to me like that! Roy is escaping! He is taking my jeep along. The inspector has fled as well. Where are you going? Manav, catch him! You fool, why are you catching me? Catch him! -Catch him, come on. -He ran away. Manav, sit. Fool, sit here! Come! Quickly. There is no handle, how will I drive? The scoundrels want the money! They have not even seen a single penny yet! I have spent ten years looking for Bose. I will not let anyone get the money. I will see how they get the money. We will get the money! -Yes. -Why will we let the money go? Shut up! Do you think it's so easy? I will not give you a single penny. A fake snake! He wants to scare me with a fake snake. You want the money, right? Get lost! Let's see how you get the money. Hey, why are you looking at me? Look in the front. Why can't I see you? Look, I am warning you. Look ahead or else... Or else! Or else what? I will keep looking at you. I will see you. I will keep looking at you. Do what you can? What happened? Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! -Dad! -Say "Dad", you scoundrel. I have finally found you. Just like that, my son must have screamed when you made pieces of him! His bumper, his tire, his doors must have begged for mercy. -You're merciless. -Please forgive me.

Hurry up son, I can already imagine the money in our hand. Dad, Goa is that way. Why are you going on this side? Son, airport is 25 kilometers from here. We will reach sooner. What are you staring at? Move aside, come on. I will bear you. Give me a ticket to Goa, hurry up. Hey... I don't give tickets, I send people on the final journey. He is not the conductor.

Did you stop the car to give us a lift or to torture us? God. Why are you troubling us? Its capable of going in the pier and not on wheels. Oh, God! It doesn't even work properly. Come on, Manav, get out. Sell this car, add some more money and buy a pair of roller skates. The one's that Hrithik Roshan had in Dhoom. Yes, at least they will work! You wander around with a scrap car and then you call people to trouble them. To hell with you, I don't want to go to Goa with you! Brother, Goa. You scoundrel! -You scoundrel! -How dare you abuse me? My mother told me not to fight with anyone. You abused me. You called me fish curry. You, your entire family is a fish curry. Your car will meet with an accident.

Who is that traitor that has escaped my sight! -Who is he? -Brother, you are suspecting me again. I will deal with you later, first search this boy. Read, what is written in it?

My uncle was crueler than Dracula and Satan. He never gave me anything other than abuses to eat and water to drink. And you are asking me to do it for him. Do it for your father. Don't do that. Don't do that. Because I still don't know who my father is. My cheap father got my mother pregnant. -Really? -I mean, unmarried mother. Once I find him...

You are trying to teach me. Because of you we missed that bike. If we had that bike, we would have reached Goa soon. Because of you we hit the man. He was a respectable man. What do you want? Look here, I am looking like a fool. That man in the night dress, sat on the bike and left. We are still here and... -I was calling you. -But why didn't you say this?

Get lost! Babu. Hey, stop. Tie people up properly. They free themselves and do such crazy things. -Isn't it? -Yes. Tie properly. Catch him, don't let him escape. How can he escape!

Father says I'll do something Hey... -Here, hold this. -What are you doing? -Boy, come here. -No, sir... No. -Sit here. -But, sir... How can Boman fly the plane? Brother. Mr. Pilot. You made him emotional again. What was the need to play the song? He is drinking alcohol again. All this has happened because of you, useless! -God! -Oh, Lord! What are you doing? Pilot. -Boman. -Yes. The pilot is unconscious. -What? -Yes! Saved. -Seems like they left. -Yes, they left. -He ran away. -He ran away. What are you laughing at, catch him! Thank God I got rid of that child. Oh, sir! Oh, sir! All my dates were sold! -All my dates were sold! -Quiet! It is only you! It is only you! So many children. Keep quiet, you don't even let us sleep! Someone put a tape on his mouth. It is of no use, he sings from the nose. Then break his nose. Thrash him! Thrash him! Uncle, save me! Uncle, save me! Hail Ram! Uncle, where are you? -I am in the garden son. -In the garden. In the hanging garden. Hello! Can anybody hear my voice, hello! Dad, I can hear it! I can hear it! Not you, fool! Hello! Hello! I am Dev Kumar Malik. Welcome to Goa flying club. I am always available here... 24 hours for any emergency. They appoint anyone for the emergency services. He is so slow. You just tell me, what is your problem? Our problem is we are on a private plane and the pilot is unconscious! What should we do? Then who is flying the plane? I am flying it. Yes, Boman, Boman. My name is just Boman once. So Boman just once, have you ever flown a plane before? He has never even swatted a fly before. Tell us how we can land the plane. Before landing the plane, we should know about flying the plane. And before knowing how to fly, we should know about the plane. The plane that you are flying right now it weighs 2084 kilos and 300 grams. It's technology is comprised of two computers and two pilots control, it is a private plane. Two engines, two propellers and three wheels. How do we get down? There are two doors at the back and one emergency door in the cockpit to get down. And on top of that, that's almost everything. We should save uncle. He is not even our driver. So what? He is in this situation because of us. Why should we listen to you? Because I have all the chocolates. We will have to save him. -Come on, let us save him. -I will get the rope. Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up! Uncle, catch the rope and come up! We have tied the rope to the bus! Come on, uncle! Come on! -Uncle, save us! -Uncle, save us! Quiet! Do you think I was in the hanging garden that you came to play with me? -Uncle, save us! Uncle, save us! -Quiet! Stop this nonsense, and tell us how to land. Haste makes waste. Humans should have patience. Take a look at something right in front of you. -What do you see? -Death! No, before death. Is there a big, round wheel in front of you? Yes, there is! Is there a red button on the side of the wheel? Yes, I have pressed it! What's next? You shouldn't have. If you press that button, it shuts off the main engine. Useless! You've ruined it! Now the main engine is off... and the other engine is shoddy. The second engine is working. No, what I meant to say that... it's not genuine. The engine is bogus. It is on right now, that means it is working. But we don't know for how long it will work. -Oh, Lord! -Dad. Look ahead! No, uncle. Don't leave me. Wait, I will go up and save you all. No, uncle. I will come along with you. -Okay. -And, what about us? You both can come later. -Come on, brother. -Brother! Come on, mother. Uncle, come soon! Uncle, please save us. Please... Save us! Please, uncle! Uncle, please save us. -Quiet Save! Quiet! -Save us! I have come to save you, not to play cricket. Have some courage and patience. And stay calm. We don't have time for all that. Listen to me. Look at the indication on the fuel meter. The red light is on. That means, the fuel is about to end as well. What? What should we do now? -Now repeat after me. -What? Lord, all the sins that I have committed. -Lord, all the sins that I have committed. -Lord, all the sins that I have committed. -Please forgive me for that. -Please forgive me for that. We are coming to you. -We are coming to... -We are coming to... Hey! Shut up! We don't want to die! Whether you want it or not, everyone has to die one day. Because death is a truth that can never stay away from us. Humans are unaware, and death keeps coming closer to them every moment. And suddenly, it comes very close. Sir, death has come close to us as well! Stop! Oh, God! -Greetings, sir. -Excuse me, can you drop us to Goa. Come with me. How long will it take to reach Goa? We will reach as we finish introducing our names. He is Aditya Shrivastav. Adi, is he telling us his name or reading out the telephone directory of Chennai? Quiet! Quiet! Stop the car! I don't want to go anywhere with you! You are mad! I will drop you. Will you drop me? You scoundrel, I will not spare you! You have such a big name. No, sir. I will hit you! If this is your pet name, then what is your real name? -I will tell you. -You won't say anything! -Manav, get out! You won't say anything! -Your name... Quiet! Here, take this! You... Babu! Brother, please don't shoot! I have 10,00,00,000 rupees. 10,00,00,000 rupees. 10,00,00,000 rupees. We shouldn't hide from death. Because death can find us from anywhere. What is it? Have you gone mad? Are you asking for help or my life? Did I tell you to sit in the plane? I don't ask anyone for help. Why do you do such things that you have to ask for someone's help? Go! From that side! -Are you all right? -Are you hurt? Uncle, please take us to Goa. Our show is about to start. Your show is about to start, but my show has started. -Come on, come on. -Come on, come on. Brother, 10,00,00,000 rupees. We will divide it equally. Look, if it turns out to be a lie then I will shoot you. Babu, don't waste any more time. How will we find a car to reach Goa? I don't need to think about it. I hijack a bus. So, hijacking a car is not an issue. Do you want to see? Look! Stop! Stop! Old woman, get out! We need your car! Come on! Have your parents not taught you any manners? Is this the way you talk to women? She is asking you to get out! Aunt, please give us a lift. Excuse me, sir, do you know where St. Sebastian church? -Near the bridge. -No. -Behind the old church. -No! -Then. In the yellow alley? -No! -Then where is it? -I don't know. -Nonsense! You're wasting my time! -Don't get violent! -I don't... -What is happening? We have reached the runway. Land it! Land it! Land it! Dad, we have landed! Get away! Get away! Run! Dad. That scoundrel driver! Come on. Hurry up. Where do you want to go? Come on, hurry up! Come on. Drive fast. -But where do you want to go? -St. Sebastian garden. -Hurry up. -Quickly! Speed up! Speed up! -Fast. -But what's the hurry? -The money... -She stole my heart... Quiet! Come on, drive. You are such a well-mannered boy. But your friend is absolutely dirty... disgusting and manner less brute. What is she saying? She is praising you, Babu. Aunt, if you see a hardware store, then please stop the car. -Drive faster, boy. -Don't hit me! What do you mean? Are you driving a car or a handcart? Come on. Get down quickly! -Here, keep it. -Adi, the change... -Keep it. -Adi, take the change. The garden is closed. We will come back later. Greetings, Mr. St. Sebastian. Here. Take your money! Boman, come quickly. -Get down! -I am getting down. Hurry up. Where are you going with the shovel? To row a boat! Do you want to come? Come on, Babu. She is talking nonsense! -Come on, quickly. -You... We have reached St. Sebastian garden! Manav, I will look for the "W" here. You look there. As soon as you find it, please shout. Dear dad, you search for the "W" there. -I will search for it here! -Search for it quickly. Where is the "W"? The "W" is in this garden, we will have to search for it. You look for it there, and I will look for it here. What is it? -It's upside down of "M". -What is "M"? Is anyone here? Where is this "W"? It must be there. Where is it? How does this "W" look like? He is from Sholay. Are you searching for it or playing games? We can't find it. Let us look for "V". Why should we look it? Actually "V" comes before "W". Who was he? Must be the gardener? Gardener? Looks like a dacoit Mahakali. To hell with dacoit Mahakali! We have to look for "W"! A big "W". Come on. Babu, did you find it? No, I didn't, but I found three men with shovels. What? Who is he? Who is he? -And who is he? -Why is Nari uncle here? -And who was he? -He is Adi. Which one is "W" amongst them? You... All of us know that we are here. There is no use of hiding. Nari uncle, come out! What are you doing with the gardener? -He is not a gardener, he is a dacoit. -Dacoit! You scoundrels reached here. Not just us, four scoundrels! You are along with us. Look... Stop, guys. There is no use fighting amongst ourselves. Roy is absolutely right. There is no use fighting amongst ourselves. You can fight with Roy and I will fight with Boman. -Stop. -Shut up! All of us know, no matter who finds the "W", you cannot take the money alone. -Can he take? -No. So, it is better that we search for it together -and divide the money equally. -Yes, that's right. Come on, let us look for the "W". -Where can that be? -It must be around here somewhere. He said it was a big "W". We are not such big fools that we will miss the "W" right in front of us. You are all wasting time. Roy, both of you go to that side. Boman, you both go to that side. Okay. You come with me. Walk ahead. We have to look for " W"! Do you have a tissue? What will you do with it? The crow has flown away. It is crow shit. What is it? Dad! The "W". We have found the "W"! We have found the "W"! Congratulations, you have found the "W". Who is he now? Ask him yourself. Who are you? Prime Minister? Since I met you, my terror is over. Does anyone else want to say anything? Look, inspector, we won't let you take the money alone. -Not at all. -He was right. Who said? I am saying, let us take the money out and divide it equally. Give it to me. No, I will dig it. Don't take the trouble. -No, the mobile. -You want to make a call. -Come on, let's do it. -Come on. Let's do it. Dig it come on dig it! Come on, dig. -Come on. -Dig. Come on, Boman, dig it. I am tired. Manav, come on. Keep on digging! Hurry up, come on! Dig it! Dig it! -Dig it! -Manav, what are you saying? -Dig it! -Okay. -Dig it! -Dig it! Dig it! Bravo, hurry up! Hurry up! If you dig it, you will get the money. -Babu, give me your hand. -Come on. If you dig it, you will get the money. Come on, dig. Come on, Boman. Hey, you get out. Hey, talk to me with respect. Babu is another name for terror. Hey you terrorist, come out. Coming. -I have found it! I have Found it! -I have found it! The lid. Bag! Lift it. Open! Open! Come on, -let us divide the money quickly -Yes! One share for Nari. One share for Boman. And one share for Adi and Manav. Just a minute. -What do you mean by one share? -Both of you are the same unit. Yes! They are same unit! We are not giving a unit test. It is not so easy. We are two units. And Boman's car that you had wrecked... you will pay for that, won't you? The car is Boman's father and not Boman's. I want that money. Uncle, take that money from Boman's share. You had wrecked the car why should I alone pay for it? Then, who will pay for it? You three will pay for it. Just a minute Why will Adi and Manav pay for the car from their single share? That's injustice. Why are you considering us one? We are two people. How dare you ask for two shares? Did you talk about my share? He was not even a part, yet he wants the money. Roy has made a deal with him. How could you even think of dividing the money equally? Don't you dare drag my father into this! We will drag your mother into this! K.G class keep quiet! turn. What can you do, cheap detective? You coward, I will. Your father is a coward! Again father... Roy is not a coward. Yes, you dragged my father into this. -You! -Why did you hit my dad? Come on, hit him. Even you! Why did you hit my dad! -Boman, you scoundrel! -Sorry, dad. You had come for your 50 million isn't it? Then, what are you doing here? -Hey, leave me. -You are not alone, even I am with you. What are you doing? You shameless, what do you want? 50,00,00,000 rupees! 50,00,00,000 rupees! Did you get your 50 million? Old man, I will... Enough! Enough! He is running. -Shut up! -He is running very fast. -Hey, come down. -Please come down. It is coming down! Hey there it is. Come on, run. Hey Boman, take this money. Take more. Take more. -Who are you all, and what is all this? -Money! It is 10,00,00,000 rupees. 10,00,00,000 rupees. 10,00,00,000 rupees. Have you come to distribute the money? Yes, we are going to divide this money amongst all. They have come to distribute it. We will have to, because each one of us wants that. Wonderful! This money belongs to all of us, so, we have to distribute it! They have come to distribute 10,00,00,000 rupees. So, friends, now we will see what our total donation is. What? Our total was 9,11,000 rupees... but after their donation, it has become 10,09,11,000 rupees. We run the Help Orphans Organization... and these are some of our children. I always told my children... that you are not an orphan. But then I didn't believe myself. But today... I realized... that I was not wrong. Until people like you are in this world... no child can ever be an orphan. With your money, these children will have food to eat... a house to stay... and get good education. The seven of you are like the seven colors of the rainbow. And you have come to spread happiness in the lives... of these children. We can get your operation done and you will be able to walk again. You will be able to run now. I always said that you are useless, Boman. But today you have proved... that you are my true son. You are my wealth. -Love you, Dad! -My beloved son! Come on, Adi. Give them the money! Why should I? Have I gone mad? They have all gone mad. Come on, Adi. This money is for the orphans. We are orphans as well. Mom must be watching over us. What will she be thinking? Come on, Adi. Please do it for mom's sake. Come on. And now, I would like to invite our chief guest. He will come and thank our friends. Sir, I am ready to go to Yavatmal. By tomorrow, you will get this. -I don't want a snake, sir. -Not a snake, but this. -What is this, sir? -Your promotion letter. I am speechless. The money can't be put to any better use.
