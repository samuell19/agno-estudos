The rest is just kind of history. - I'm so happy for you. I always knew you'd make a great husband. - Oh really? I find that kind of hard to believe being that you broke up with me in the most worst possible way ever. - Bakari, I'm gonna own that. I should have talked to you, I should have. But I knew if I would've sat and had a conversation with you and looked into those puppy dog eyes, I would've folded. I had to go, I had to go right then. And you would've just talked me out of it and I couldn't have let that happen. - But did you have to leave the whole continent? By the time I heard from you you were already in Spain. And of course I was gonna talk you out of it, I was dumb in love with you. - And I was in love with you too but we were so young. I had all these dreams. I wasn't ready to be a wife or a mother. You always knew exactly what you wanted and I, you were just too much too soon. - Well, I guess thanks for not leading me on. - How about we get lunch, catch up, on me? - Tabi, I'm good, I got a lot of errands I gotta run. It was really good seeing you though. - It was good seeing you too. Congratulations on everything, you were always gonna go get her. - I'm gonna make sure I cop those covers too. I'll get like five of them, get you to autograph 'em. Then I'm gonna sell 'em on eBay. - Shut up, I got something better. Take a selfie. Now I'm gonna let everybody know I know the new Diddy. You gonna hit me up the next time you're in Miami, right? - Promise. - You always kept your promises. Talk to you later. [soft piano music] - Imani, Imani, let me get this straight. You got a brand new, big ass house and you still on my couch, can you please make this shit make sense? - I already told you, BK OD'd on me and I'm not about to let that nigga put his hands on me, period. - You said he choked you, but did he like choke you choke you? - It don't matter, that's how shit starts. - Okay, okay, better stop playing with that nigga. Okay crybaby, for real, for real, why he turn up on you like that? - We ran into Dre and that shit went low real quick. - Dre? Bitch, you still on that? Did you record it? Bitch, you know Instagram! - No, almost. But Dre told BK that I was texting him and-- - Wait, wait, what? - All I said was a couple text messages in my phone and BK-- - Wait, wait, why do you have text messages from Dre? - It was just simple shit, good morning texts, nothing serious. - Man, I ought to punch you in the face. Don't no married man want his girl texting no nigga. - Carra, it was not that serious. He went way overboard. He just a control freak. - Bitch, don't no man want his wife texting no other nigga. Then y'all see his ass and he got receipts? You the one looking dumb, and played. - Bitch, you been taking his side since I met him. He is not perfect. He want to control everything. He don't want me to work, he went and picked out this big house without my opinion, he always gone and-- - And what, bitch? And he's faithful, and he got you a big ass house and he fine as fuck. And, do he have a big dick? I knew it, bitch, okay! So it's 80-20, the pros and the cons. You better go home and get your nigga 'cause if a bitch like me come across a nigga like that, I'm gonna change his life. Okay, your dumb ass. - Bitch, go find you a man. You glad I'm your company.

You got that stuff prepared for the shoot today? - No, nigga, elephant in the room, man. You talking money and what not. She back at the house, all is well, let me know what's up. - Actually, none of that. But not really focused on that and we got a lot of shit to do. But while you're here. Cyrus, would you stop using the company credit card for your personal shit, bro? - Me, no. Who told you that? - I get the credit card statements, Cyrus. Fortunately, Tatiana found a discrepancy while I was gone. [mumbling] Huh? - Look, I do not recall. - Cyrus. - What? - We been friends since freshman year in college.

Why you keep playing with him like that? - Cyrus, BK is grown, he can make his own decisions and if he decides he wants to go to lunch with me that's what it'll be. - You know what, every time you come around you're on that bullshit, you know that, right?

So you just gonna expose your husband to all of social media like this? - Expose? I was just telling my truth, it's probably gonna help somebody. - Look bitch, shut up. So Aisha Curry now? - All my followers support me. You supposed to be my friend, you acting like a op. - Girl, now although I am here for all the drama, endless chasers, you really gonna air all your dirty laundry in front of everybody? I mean your husband is low key popping and this shit kind of messy. - Look, this is about me, not him. Look at my comments, they understand what I'm going through. - Girl, who, all these damn strangers? Do your husband even know what's going on? Do he even know what happened? You know I talked to Carra already and she said you and him ain't even talking. - First of all y'all bitches need to stop talking about me behind me back. Look, I'm gonna talk to him when I get ready. - Look Imani, all I know is if you would've told the man about your past this situation probably wouldn't have ever happened. Now, this post, about to have all these thirsty background bitches popping up out the wood works. Like The Walking Dead. - Look, my past don't have anything to do with me and him. It's none of his business. But if a background bitch can take him, he was never mine. - Girl, you giving the nigga away. You supposed to be covered. But you done sent his ass back on the display case for all these thirsty ass hoes out here and you know they window shopping with they broke asses. - He gonna have to learn a lesson about me. - Ooh, so my spider senses are tingling and telling me, you gonna take this L. Right. Well go get them sequins, girl. Come on so we can go tack this old tacky ass dress behind you. Smack this. [mumbling] - She owe this, man, she got my purse. - Yo, I can't believe she did this. She knows what this'll do to my career. - Man, we gotta get in front of this. The blogs will have a field day with this and I'm sure Imani not even thinking about the backlash. - Of course she not thinking about no fucking backlash. Her ass thinking about getting some damn attention. - God damn gotta know it, bro. Woo-wee. - Get me an interview, Cyrus. I need to be on the radio show first thing in the morning. I can't afford to have this type of press especially with Fax and Trans' project dropping soon. Hell no. - I got this. You know the folks at J96 love you man. They would want an exclusive from you. Where you going, man, you not gonna help me? - I think I'll pull up, this shit has gone too far. - You know where she at? - I got a good idea. - Mr. King, have you seen this? [mumbling] Jeff. - Yeah, yeah, snitch. Call Steve Harvey. [tense music] - I'm not mad, Cyrus, I'm just gonna pull up to talk to her. Look, this shit has gone on far too long.

[groaning] - License and registration. - Here you go, officer. - Keep your hands on the steering wheel too. Mr. King, where you coming from? - Coming from my office in Lenox. - Office? What do you do for work? - I work at a record label. - What are you, a rapper or something? You dress like one. - No, I'm not a rapper. I'm like a talent scout. Anyway, I'm kind of in a rush, officer. - You wanna tell me why you're parked back here then? - I lost GPS signal. I pulled over, I was looking for an address. I'm just trying to be on my way and I'm not breaking any laws so what's-- - Yeah' well see about that. Sit tight for me. Black lives matter. - [Cop] Mr. King, is there anything in the vehicle you want to tell me about? - No, nothing at all, sir. - Go ahead and step out of the vehicle for me. - [Bakari] Can I ask why? - Yeah, there's been a number of break ins in the area, you have a breaking and entering charge on your record. Now step out of the vehicle. - Officer, but that was a long time ago. - Step out of the vehicle. I'm not gonna ask you again, you understand me? Keep your hands in plain sight. Get out now. Slowly. - [Dispatcher] Calling all cars in the area of North Druid Hills, 211 in progress at Walsh Brother Jewelers, please respond. - Patrol car 1644 is right around the corner. I'll be there in just a second. Looks like it's your lucky day, mister talent scout. Move along and don't let me catch you over here again, you understand me? [door knocking] - I told you, keep that loud shit down around here. I got nosy ass white neighbors. Do not pull up, what the fuck? That's why she don't fuck with you, you don't listen. - Toccara, let me in. - Go home, Bakari. - Imani, come talk to me. - That's what we not gonna do. No, now I'm trying to help you and you fucking shit up. - I just, I just want to talk to her. I need to talk to her. - You gonna have to leave or you gonna make me call a security nigga. - I'll beat dude ass. - Probably, but he be calling the cops and shit, Bakari, and I ain't trying to get you locked up. - Well I'm gonna just sit here till y'all come out then. - Oh no the fuck you not, you not gonna have us locked up in here. Just be cool and go home. - Why's she doing this, Carra? This shit don't make no sense. - She said something about y'all moving too fast and all this but I don't know. But I'll just tell you all that later. - Moving too fast? You say that after we just got married and a brand new house? - You really want me to call security? Look, I don't know how much she told you about her past but one of her exes hospitalized her, like beat her the fuck up. - What, she never told me that. - Okay, she don't tell nobody that. So who knows what psychological shit you stirred up when you did what you did. But who knows, that's just the state that she's in right now. Just go home and I'll call you, just chill, damn! - Sorry for popping up at you. - It's cool, Bakari. - Imani, I love you, but I'm not gonna wait forever. Yes, Cyrus? - Hey man, I been calling your ass about an hour, nigga. - Man, look, yesterday I got caught in a whole Black Lives Matter situation. Yeah, I mean cop, gun, the whole scenario. - Damn bro, you good? - Man, I don't know what I did but it just seems like the universe has been taking a major shit on me. It seems like ever since I got that promotion everything's been going left. - You gonna be good, bro? - [Bakari] Yeah, I'll be alright. - You sure? - Yeah bro, but what's up with this radio interview? - Yeah, that's why I was calling you, man. You know what, talked to 'em, they said they're good with the exclusive and everything but they can only get you on the show Monday morning. - Fuck, it's Friday, so you mean I gotta let this shit marinate all weekend? - Hey, you try to talk to Imani, man? - I pulled up. She wouldn't come to the door. I started talking to Carra and then she ended up telling me some shit about Imani's past that really got me fucked up. - Really, what's up? - Man, I'll talk to you about it later. - All right man, look, you got till Monday morning to get all your talking points and shit together. Just go home, chill out, clear your mind. Just let this shit go for the night, alright, let it go. - Honestly Cyrus, yo, I hate being in that house all alone. It's like I bought the shit for her. It don't even feel right no more. But I'll just pulling up on Fax and Trans and work on some promo stuff and try to keep myself busy. - Alright man, the best thing for you to do is to dead all that social media shit. That's the best bet, alright? You still going on Saturday, right? - Yeah, I'll be there. - Alright, and you know Kurt is still doing the Fourth of July grill. - Alright, well I'll meet you later, alright? - Alright.

While we going through paperwork, do you know she leaned in and kissed me? - So did you kiss her back? - I ain't gonna cap, I kind of let it happen for a while. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, Tatiana kissed you? - Yeah. - Damn, man, I was gonna try to get that, man. - No, no, dog, never fuck with chicks you do business with.

Pop up at the office yesterday. - Excuse me, is your name Imani, right? - Um yes, do I know you? - I'm sorry, this may seem strange but I'm an old friend of BK's. I just see you guys all over social media and blogs all the time. Wow, you're even prettier than the pictures. Yes, body, yes, all of this. - Yes, and I'm feeling this bohemian vibe. Too cute! - Thank you. So I'm Tabitha, me and BK went to college together. - Oh, it's nice meeting you. - So, I don't wanna pry. I just seen all the drama online and I just want you to know you got my support. Even as a friend of BK's, just know that if the situation isn't safe for you, if you don't feel protected, you leave. You don't look back, okay? - I appreciate that, thank you so much. - You got my support, girl. Better go, it was nice meeting you. - You too. - Girl. - What? - Who was that? - One of BK friends from college, she's nice. And she supports me. [laughing] - The Walking Dead.

I'm about to pull right back up now, nigga. Stay right there, I'm gonna be right back. - So let me get this straight, alright? So your wife throws you under the bus on social media. At the same time, your intern shoots a shot and your ex, your first love, who is lit right now by the way, shows up to town looking for you? Man, you in some real drama in these streets. But look, I told him, I said don't get married. Now look at the universe showing you all your options. - All of 'em, HD. - What the hell are you talking about? Weren't you just in some weird love triangle? Shit, like a month ago. - Y'all just can't let me live, can you? That was the old Lance, I'm engaged now. Man, fuck y'all. [laughing] We talking about BK. - For real though, what are we gonna do about this post? You gotta respond. - Man, I'm going to 96 Jams first thing Monday morning. I gotta put a spin on this shit ASAP. - You know I got you on legal representation. We just need to see where her head is in this. You talk to her yet? - So I pulled up to Carra's house. - So no. - And I'm trying to talk to Imani, get her to come to the door but she won't fucking talk to me. Then Carra goes, starts explaining about some crazy ex that Imani had, said that nigga really fucked her up, put her in the hospital and everything. It's like damn, she never told me that before. - Damn bro, you know that might actually explain a lot. - Yeah, it's the same thing Carra was saying, saying it might be bringing up some psychological past shit. But still though, after all that we been through, as long as we been together and you never told me that? How could she not tell me that, I'm her husband. - You know, people cope with things differently, bro. Like instead of keeping all that put away maybe it's easier for her not to retell her story all the time. - Nah, she still gotta give my nigga a chance to explain. These bitches act like we gotta be perfect. - Bitches, why they gotta be bitches? - And they're doing bullshit all the time. - Damn, respect the ladies, bro. - How did a woman even agree to marry your ass? - Look at me, I'm an amazing nigga. Masters degree, education, looks, I'm the cream of the crop. At least she knows she's winning with me. - Winning! [chattering] - Alright nigga, I'm gonna pull right back up. - See, you niggas don't know your worth. These women got us running around like its all about them. But we know this is a man's world, fellas. We all know what it boils down to. They gonna return to our house when they want or need a man. Go to work the next day for their boss who's a what? A man, exactly. Besides, all you gotta do is have a little money, have a little swag, you got her. They're just as shallow as us. - Hell no, hell no, don't lump us in that shit. They're not as shallow as you, hell no. Keep that over there. - Fact and you sound like an old caveman right now. Women enhance everything. They make everything better. They make it smell better, make it taste better. Shit, a world full of niggas would be trash. - All I'm saying is look at us. We're educated, employed, we're young kings, the cream of the motherfucking crop, know your worth, know your worth. - I know my worth, nigga. - Hey, who gave you niggas permission to hoop over here? - Oh God, this nigga. Remember we had to roll up? - Oh! - Oh look, famous bitch niggas. - Yo, I'm really tired of seeing your fucking face and I ain't gonna be too many more bitches either. - What's up then? - What's up? - Corny ass niggas. Lucky I'm in a good mood today otherwise you'll end up dead. Feel real great, real positive. Black lives matter, right? I catch you niggas around here again, next time I won't be so nice. - Hey, I almost pulled a strap on this nigga, man. I got kids. - How this nigga gonna tell me I can't hoop in my own hood? This nigga crazy. - Fuck! Bitch ass niggas. - Yo, I'm trying to figure out where the fuck this nigga came from. Just pop up out of nowhere. Yo BK, you good, man? - I'm straight. - Man, fuck dude, alright? Let's go record this video for your IG, alright? Come on, man, come on. Man, this gonna come my savage out. [engine starting] - Alright, let's get it together, bro. Alright, let's get these ladies back on your side before Monday, you ready? Let's get it. - What's going on Instagram family and friends, I just wanted to come and first and foremost thank you for all the love, all the support, all the comments. It's been a really rough 24 hours but no need to worry. Monday morning I'll be on 96 Jams. Make sure you tune in for that. I'll be setting the record all the way straight.

But I really do appreciate you bringing me on. - You know I got you. And where's Cyrus crazy ass these days? That boy is so stupid. - Miss P, we go live in five. - I hope you're ready. - Four, three, two. - Good morning, Atlanta, it's your girl Miss P with the T and my guest is in the building to spill it. Live from the studio we have the Vice President of A&R at one of the fastest growing music labels in the city, Mr. Bakari King from Theory Records is in the building and in case you have been hiding under a rock than you have probably seen the post on social media that his wife Imani has posted and for reference sake, I'm just gonna read it verbatim. I usually don't get this personal online but I feel like I should share my truth with some other women around the world who may be going through the same thing in their relationship. Me and my husband Bakari have been married for almost a year and we just started trying to have a baby. Nobody has ever made me as happy as him, aw. I thought he was perfect until we got into a fight a few weeks ago. I won't get into any details but he lost his temper and put his hands on me. Well them sure sound like details to me. It was a side of him that I had never seen before. I been in an abusive relationship before and I promised myself I would never let it happen again. I've adopted a zero tolerance policy and that's how I've lived ever since. So I left my husband and our brand new house, really? Because I needed to be sure that this situation is what's best for me. Anyone who's in a similar situation, I want you to know that you are not alone. Do what you have to do for you. Love you babies. Okay well, Mr. King, welcome to the show. - Thanks for having me, P. - Now 96 Jams and Mr. King have a little history, Atlanta. BK, well that's what the boss man used to call him because his name was too long, BK was an intern here way before he was out discovering your latest rappers. So he's like extended family to us and so now you know we had to get him in here. - I appreciate you. - Okay so listen, I'm gonna shut my mouth and just tell me what's going on, friend. - P, you know and a lot of my followers know me or know of me. It's crazy what's being said. I love women. I support women. 80% of my staff at the label, they're women. So honestly it's really hard to see and hear all these comments on social media, people calling me a woman beater, just saying that I don't have any respect, saying I took it too far and that's just not me. I'm none of those things. My wife is telling the truth. I did lose my temper and I did touch her in a way that was too aggressive. What I should've done was just talked, communicated, asked questions, taken a step back when I was calm. But no scars or bruises, nothing like that, no cops were called, it wasn't a fight and I didn't beat up my wife. It was just two passionate people that let things get out of hand. [phone ringing] I just made a terrible decision. But you know me, P, I'm not really one to get too into my personal business so I'm not gonna take any calls or answer any questions or anything like that but I will say this, Imani, you're my friend, you're my wife. I love you and I just want you to come home. I'm saying it in front of the whole world. - Mm, Imani, forgive him, girl. He is out here looking too pitiful. And you know he too fine to be single. Well thank you for stopping by, Bakari. Even though you walking out on all these phone calls. We gonna take a pause for the cause and when we come back we will have new music from Theory Records camp, B-H in Fax and Trans, what are you doing up next in three minutes, 96 Jams. So how you just gonna leave my listeners like that? - Look, I gotta get to the office. There's a lot of work that needs to be done and I'm really not trying to stick around and hear the hate right now. I already had to turn my comments off on IG. - Well you know how that goes, you hood famous. [grunting] - It's good to see you. - Look man, this too shall pass. - I know, thanks, P. - This bitch ain't tell me nothing. - Hello? - Girl, why I gotta hear this drama on the radio? You ain't be answering my calls or texts. I had to call Carra and she acting all mysterious and shit. And she told me you was over Dre house though. You fucking Dre? - Y'all don't call me, Missy, let me clear this shit up real quick. I did not sleep with Dre. I crashed over there a couple days 'cause I knew BK would be calling all the hotels and shit. - So y'all ain't fuck. - No bitch, no. - Bitch. - What'd I just say? - Okay, that's cap, anyway, about the interview BK did, what the hell you talking about? - You didn't see my Instagram post? - Imani, you know I'm on social media detox. Damn, I'm missing everything. He beat your ass? You know I'll come air that bitch out. - Mm-mm, girl, calm down. He ain't beat me up but he did put his hands on me. - Okay so he slapped you, punched you, what? - No, he came in the house drunk and we was kind of arguing. He put his hands around my throat, I had to get him up off me. - Damn, wait, so was this after y'all ran into Dre at the restaurant? - How do you know about that? - Uh, Jordan, duh, so did you really think he was gonna hurt you? - I don't know, I didn't think so before but now I'm not sure. He just scared me. - Oh damn, boo, he don't seem like the type. But did he apologize? - He keep trying but I ain't really trying to talk to him. He popping up at Carra house and shit. - Oh, so you're not gonna forgive him? - See y'all keep saying that, y'all just don't get it. - Imani, I remember what you went through so I understand. - Y'all really think y'all some hood therapists. I'm not even talking about what Trap did to me. I think I might be pregnant. - Hey yes! - Don't tell nobody, bitch. - Lips are zipped. - I'm for real. - Me too, you been feeling sick, throwing up? Oh, Bakari don't even know. - Slow down. I just been feeling a little off so I'm gonna take a test. I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I love him but this little incident, I just never seen him like this before. - Well take the test before you start stressing 'cause if you are pregnant we're gonna have to kill all this little drama. It's not good for the baby and let me get on my mama shit. It was dumb for you to make that post. He still your husband and now possibly your baby daddy. - You know what, ever since we got together it's been BK, BK, BK, like a bitch invisible or something. - You know that's not how I meant it. Whether you like it or not, y'all are in the public eye now. Every little thing you say online, it's gonna be under microscope. So just saying choose your posts wisely. That shit never goes away. - Okay, thank you, talk to you later. - What, you got an attitude now? - Bye! - This bitch. She pregnant. - I'm not even gonna be petty about you standing me up 'cause I heard you on the radio this morning. - Tabi, I apologize. It's just so much shit going on right now. - I understand. I saw the infamous post. Bakari, I know you're not that guy, you could never be. - I'm glad someone knows it. - Can I ask you something? I was wondering how long you and your wife been together because I remember a particular day party. We were so happy to see each other, we had margaritas, we walked back to the hotel and made love the entire afternoon, it was beautiful. - Oh, 'cause I remember. I remember going to sleep and waking up to a note and you leaving me, ghost again, and some Polaroid of me sleeping, real cute. If I'm being completely honest, that was the day I made the decision to propose to Imani 'cause I knew me and you were a wrap. - Wow, that's kind of deep. I had an early flight and I didn't wanna wake you. Bakari, I still wanna be your friend. - You know what, Tabi? I'm tired of being nice and I'm tired of playing this little game. I don't wanna be your friend and I'm not gonna sit here and pretend like everything is okay and it's not. You really fucked me up, you broke my heart. To be honest, the only reason I keep letting you come back around is 'cause I hope you, it doesn't even matter. - Yeah, wow, tonight has been perfect. - And that's kind of why I wanted to make sure the time was right before I did this, make sure you're done with your finals and everything first. Tabitha, I haven't stopped smiling since the first day we met and no woman has truly ever made me happy and honestly, I've never felt this way about anyone before. - BK-- - Just let me finish. You didn't judge me based on my reputation. You never gave up on me when I was damn near was wanting to give up on myself. And to be honest, the way I feel in this moment, I want to feel like this forever with you. So, will you marry me? Well? - Um, BK, can I think about it? - Think about it? Okay. - I'm sorry, I just need more time. - Tabitha, I'm really fucking confused right now. We talk about marriage all the time. What? - Let's talk about this in the morning. Tonight has been perfect and I don't wanna ruin it. Let's just go home. [soft music] BK, last night was perfect. You did everything right. I love you with all my heart but I'm just not ready, Tabi. - Look Tabi-- - It's obvious your wife doesn't see the king in you like I always did. - Tabi, what do you want from me? - I want you to be there for me like you've always been. - I'm married now. Like that shit is over and done with. - I know and that scares me. - Oh, so I guess I'm like this security blanket, huh? Makes sense. Why I only hear from you when you're in town. What, to eat, have a place to crash, some dick. - Bakari, I know I made a mistake. I should've tried to make it work. But I'm not gonna apologize for taking control of my own destiny. But, I still want you. In the risk of being too bold, if things don't work out, I'm here. And I wasn't ready then but I'm more than ready for you now.

[coughing] - First time? - No. - Yes. - Yes. - Take your time. Why you sitting all the way over there like you scared of me or something? - Are you like a drug dealer or something? - I do what I gotta do. Don't you worry about that. Talk to your boss about me yet? - Yeah, I have an idea. I want you to come with me to this party tomorrow. I'll explain everything then. - Alright, I can do that. - No. [soft music] - Is this a check? That's a lot of zeroes. Is this real? [speaker voice muffled] Yes sir, woohoo. [chattering] - I could help you, me and my lady bought this, it cost a couple hundred thousand. I could hook you up with my realtor, bro. But forget Legal Zoom, call legal Kurt, I can get you hooked up. Matter of fact, I'm gonna hit you back later. Gimme a call, okay? - What's up, my guy? - Hey man, hey bro, I heard you on the radio the other day. - Yeah. - Very PC, real PC, man. - Yeah, I know, man, to be honest, I really wish something else would go viral so we could be done with this and this would just blow over, everybody move on. But you know there was no way I was gonna miss the annual Kurt Floyd Fourth of July kickback. - Kurt kickback, it's that hashtag. - Hey love bug, hi. - You're looking good, what's up? - BK, here, here. - Hey Sid, how you doing? - I should be asking you that. What's up with you and Imani? Y'all trying to get on a reality show or something? - Stop it, 'cause unfortunately this is my real life right now. - Oh, so sounds like you need to keep your hands to yourself, tough guy. - Chill, Sid. - No, you need to chill, little Ike Turner. - Baby, why you gotta be like that? Why don't you go have-- - No, no, no, Kurt, I got questions. I heard you on the radio but I need the real. - It's cool, Kurt. I literally had to have this little exchange with every woman that I come in contact with. But Sid, you've known me for a very long time. You know that's not me. - Well, something must've happened for her to post it. - Her posting it was nothing but an attention grab, cap. It wasn't no cry for help. - But what if it is a cry for help? See, that's your problem. Y'all always dismissing and minimizing a woman's experience. - Why you pointing at me, we married, we good. - All of y'all, all of y'all! - You know what, believe what you want. I'm tired of defending myself. Like I said, you've known me for almost 10 years. That's not me. - People change. - God, it's really good to see you, Sid. - Why you always start stuff with people, babe? - If I wanna ask a question in my house I'm gonna ask a question. - We on the rooftop. You step on my Versailles. - [Sid] I'm sorry. - We're gone buddy, look ain't you. - [Bakari] What's up y'all? - What's up, bro? - What's up, BK? - So what you and Sid over there talking about? - Man, you know Sidney, grilling my ass as always. - Man, you already know she was gonna say something. - Got to know. - I'm tired, I'm tired of talking about this situation as a whole, I'm spent, I'm done. - Look man, it's gonna blow over, okay. On another note, have you checked the SoundScan numbers, bro? It is going off. Fax and Trans, they're going off right here. Look, check this out, look at that shit. - Dope, dope. - Man, where the women at? Damn, Sidney ain't got no friends coming through? I'm just saying it's looking really sausage fest in here right now. - Hey, to be completely honest, I'm cool with that right now 'cause as of late, women have been nothing but trouble for me. A second ago, me and Imani was good. In love, buying a new house, trying to have a baby. Now she gone. Tatiana got me walking on eggshells at work. And Tabitha, oh my God, woo! - What? - Tabitha popped up again and this time it kind of really got out of hand. - Got out of hand like how? - Out of hand like what, nigga? - Come on, spit it out, damn, dramatic ass boy. - Thank you! - I almost cheated. - How the hell you almost cheat, nigga? - Right? - Come on now. - I'm saying, I was literally pulling the panties down. And then Tatiana buzzed my phone talking bout she needed me in the office for something. Snapped me back into reality real quick. - Wait, wait a minute, how you let it get this far? - She came into the office stroking my ego, talking bout how much she miss me, want to get back together and the conversation just got deep. Like on some nostalgia shit. - See, see, didn't I tell you, bro? I told you she was up to something. - You did tell me. - Well why you ain't tell me? - Bro, when it comes to Tabitha, ain't one of us ever been able to tell you shit. - Facts, nigga! - Damn, I would've fucked. - Don't start, Lance. - But why? I'm just saying your wife left you like you don't have no other options. I say you might as well show her what the fuck you got. - Lance, because I'm not trying to play those games no more. Case in point, why I got married. - Your wife seems to be playing all the games right now. - I'm gonna be honest with you, bro, ain't no more advice given on this, ain't nothing I could give you. All the predictions I came up with for Imani was wrong. Okay, alright, it's bothering me now. It's up to God. - It's above him. - It's up to God, praise the Lord. - Praise the Lord. - Praise him, praise him. - Whatever. - What you looking for? - Damn. I'll be back, man, I left my damn phone in the car. [chattering] - Hey, hey, which one of y'all niggas try to get [speaker voice muffled] He drunk, he had too much to drink. He got baby thought, baby long, baby ear. Hey come on, come on! Come on over here! - Thank you for coming. Excited. What? - You look good. - Thank you. - Where we at? What's up with your boss? - That's part of the surprise. You're about to meet him, he's here. - Okay, got little hustle in you, I like that. - Tatiana, what the fuck is this? - You know this nigga? - What's happening here? - Tatiana, why are you with this nigga? - I don't think that's any of your business, Mr. King. - Hold up, hold up, this your boss? - Y'all know each other? - You don't got your little weak ass crew with you this time. - And that don't change nothing either. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, whoa. Yo, what's going on here? - Nothing, we just talking. - Just hurry up, keep it moving. - Will do, thanks officer. - Yo Tatiana, I'm not about to go to jail fucking with this nigga. He's not welcome here. - But Cyrus invited me. - Yo I say what I said. - We're going upstairs. - Don't jeopardize your position at this label for this nigga. - You should worry about your position. - Yo, what the fuck are you on right now? Let me make it clear. If you take him upstairs, you're fired. - Oh Mr. King, you might want to rethink that. - Yo, you been recording me? So what's your plan? What, blackmail me or something? - Blackmail is such an ugly word. I just want a job. When my internship is over, I want a stunning recommendation and a guaranteed job at the label. Otherwise I could just forward these videos to the heads of the label. Or oh, the blogs. They probably would pay for this. - Do it. Post it. Email it. Text whoever you want 'cause what you don't understand about me is I'm built for this shit. Don't let these little suits and button ups fool you. I'm from the swats. You think I give a fuck about some gossip and bitch ass niggas on social media? You think that can break me? Nobody can stop me. Not you and not this nigga. So send it to the label heads. They fire me, fuck it, I'll start my own fucking label. 'Cause that's just the type of nigga that I am. I'm gonna get it regardless. My reputation's in the toilet anyways. So send it to the blogs, I can handle it. But the question is do you have the heart for the backlash, little girl? So again, let me be clear. You take this nigga upstairs and you're fired. Matter of fact, you're fired anyway. So come to the office tomorrow morning and get your shit. You record that? My wife told me you was with the shit. I should've listened.
