One last drink? No, it's late. - Then I'll drop you. - Thanks, we'll grab a cab. As you wish. Ma'am. I'm glad we worked it out. Tell Mr. Agopian. I'll see him tomorrow. Very, very glad. Good bye. - Wait for me. - Hurry up, stupid. Why, you that horny all at once? You're crazy. Let go. Let me go! Let me go! It's the last time. No more! Let me see Agopian. Beat it. I did what they wanted. I didn't screw up once. Let go or you're dead! Look at me, see these rags? I want a suit, too. To eat out with girls, give orders, everything you have! Fuck off! Can I come in? Just for a minute. TV in the morning? You can't watch TV in the morning. I can. Morning, evening, any time. I'm not the only one, or they wouldn't have it. Go home if you came to bitch. - I'm too tired. I couldn't sleep. - Then keep quiet. Lower your weapons! Give it here! Turn off the chopper, I can't hear a thing. Just one thing, for the report. Was he an accomplice? Take them out of here! Out! Come on, do something! Did you hear me? I'll come closer to the store. Want to do it differently for once? Differently? Really make love. I like it this way. You can do this alone. It's not the same. What a dumb program. Not the program, the cop. A face like that, who can believe in him? Who is it? Hey, shit! Sorry, didn't know it was you. You wanted a meeting. - Now? - Right now. It's not a good time. Can't it wait? No it can't. Let's go. If it's so urgent, who am I to argue? I'll put a bullet through your skull! What's on your mind? I think I'm wasted in that job. I don't like it and I don't make enough. There. Both things: bad pay and work I don't like. So? I want to talk to Mr. Agopian. See if he'll do something. It's important. Anyway to me. It's not to bug him. His loss if he refuses. Loss? Meaning yourself? You bet. I don't look out for others. Right away. You're wasting your time. You owe me 349 francs. Too bad, I'm out of cash and my checkbook's at home. Anyway, a check wouldn't help: my account's empty. I paid for you, 349 francs: here, look. I see your point, now try to see mine. Face it, broke is broke. Keep the bottle since you paid. I don't like this brand. Hey come on, I can't go exchange it. It's good champagne. - The most expensive. - I'd rather give it to you. No way. Do I look like a thief? How about I take your address and bring you the money? Isn't this a waste of time? No problem. I'm free and no one's waiting. When can you procure this sum? Procure? Tomorrow... It'll be procured tomorrow. Will noon do? No problem. I told you, I'm free. Listen... The sales slip, can I have it? As a reminder. So tomorrow at noon? He didn't catch on? Catch on? Not him, he's a born patsy. Trusting, friendly... you know the type. Why do you want him? I know, not my business. No, not really. By the way, we made a date. Noon at his place. I have his card. Listen... got any money? I had expenses. Here, open this at home. Read the instructions. Who knows, might be useful. You can go. Don't hang out here, it's dangerous at night. It is? Could've fooled me. It doesn't look it. For the champagne, remember? Sorry, I'm out of breath. Is the elevator on the blink? I never take elevators. Exercise? No, just because. So I won't get stuck. Your money. If you've no change, it's OK. Nice place. Just what I'd like. It's true, a big place is handy. Mine is tiny, always a mess. Here you can put stuff away. Am I right? Absolutely. Crazy how neat it is. You don't like litter. - Not very much. - Yeah, you can tell. That's fantastic. Fantastic, your kitchen. Bet this stuff costs a wad. Fairly expensive, yes. The coffee-maker, it's wild! Does everything but deliver your croissants. Tour's over. You're nuts. You do this often? Not very. I rarely meet punks like you. I didn't bust anything or rob you. What is this? You're a cop, right? Just my luck. I've had it for sure. Sit down. Stop babbling. It makes me nervous. Not another word. A guy with a gun is always right. What's your game? What d'you mean? Stop faking! You stole that bottle. I saw you, so did the store detectives. Hard not to, you made sure we'd see. - Correct? - I'm clumsy. Can't kill me for it. You can? I don't believe this. Someone sent you. I want to know who and why. You should write for TV, it pays big. Enough. Didn't your folks ever shut you up? No time. Mom shot herself when I was 15 and dad... I wouldn't know him if I saw him. What little I know, I learned on my own. What's your name? Jeremie. Jeremie? Where's that from? Jeremie what? Kolaczkowski. From my dad. All he left me, some gift. All right, Jeremie, back to our talk. Fine, but question and answer. I've no more to say. - You came on me by chance? - Who are you? You should wear a label. Sorry, but to see you isn't to know you. What d'you do in life? I get by. This and that. You know. Shop-lifting, car theft, a few burglaries? Things like that? You seem to know the territory. How about guns? Hey, warn me. Here. I really don't like this brand. Why did you do it? That was yesterday, never mind. Can I go now? You can. - Thanks. - Don't mention it. - For the money, we're square. - We are. And forget the change. Very generous of you. Shall I come in? I'm not on till ten. Not tonight, I'm beat. How's work? - It's okay. - What d'you do? Not much. I talk to people. Right up your alley. Yeah, no problem. Well, good night. Right, good night. Who're you looking for? Why didn't you ring? I walked up, the elevator's broken. Broken? May I come in? Jacky Cohen, I'm a lawyer. I don't need a lawyer. May I come in anyway? I was sent by Sam Marberg. Expecting someone? No one. Coffee? Mr. Marberg would like to have lunch with you today. All these years, Marberg never asked me to lunch. He has a proposition for you. No one told him I'm retired? Everyone. That's why the lunch, to convince you. Tell him to save his breath. I've quit for good. And I never eat at midday. Dieting? No, too much work. Tell him yourself. Maybe he'll believe it from you. You aren't like the others. Others? Marberg's usual hirelings. Thank you. Is it yes? After all, an occasional lunch... Indeed. You just have to sit down. No work. Interested in art? Just noticing there's not a speck of wind. No wind? Why are you here? I was passing by and thought I'd come see you. Passing by. That's pathetic. Really pathetic. Come along. - Where to? - Lunch. I'm keeping this. Right. I'll tell them you're here. Look, Mr. Maxandre, have lunch without me. I'll take off and see you later. How's that? Relax, my boy. No one will eat you. Not while you're with me. And don't call me Mr. Maxandre. Thanks for coming, Max. Who's he? My bodyguard. Since when do you need a bodyguard? A recent acquisition. Add a place setting. I have a job for you, Max. A very nice one. I've quit, Sam. I'm retired. What does that mean? You raise rabbits? Or collect stamps? It means you have to find someone else. Don't be hasty. I'm offering you a job... which will net you... half a million... in one go. Did I ever talk money beforehand? First the proposition, if I accept, I set the price. Can we talk in front of him? Of course. I want you to liquidate Nick Costa. Costa? He's even older than you. Leave it to nature, save yourself some money. Don't try to understand: you're too young. The time comes... when you want old accounts settled. Very well, 750,000. Hold on... what's that again? Settling accounts, that's worth 750,000 francs. Never! Blackmailer... crook! Mr. Marberg is tired. Think it over in the other room. I've set out coffee and cognac. Never! You insult an excellent cognac. Sip it, you imbecile. Get off my case, okay? You gonna do this job? Ice this Costa guy? Never mind whether I chugalug my booze or stick it up my ass. Why the bad mood? Was the lunch too rich? Save the sarcasm, I've had it. I'm dumb but not that dumb. You conned me all along. Talk about two-faced. You beat all. Of course I'll do the job. For you. For me? Think about it. A unique opportunity. The chance to learn from a master. Me and you? You're putting me on. These things only happen to me. Is it a deal? How much'll you pay me? Why should I pay? Shit, I already can't pay my rent, I'm not working for free! Okay, I'll pay you. How much? As much as you're worth. Then I'm in. See that car? Cops. What do we do? Relax. You drink cognac like a barbarian... but they don't jail you for that. Hard to relax with cops sniffing around. This may be a blow, but they don't want you. They don't even know you. Unless you're hiding something. Are you? Of course not. Why all this aggro? Don't needle me. It's not the moment. Wait in the taxi. How's retirement, Max? Just between us, it's overrated. If you can, Almeida, I advise you to keep working. Yes, I intend to. Mind if I ask why you came to see Marberg? Naturally, you needn't answer. Naturally. But no reason not to. I came to have lunch. Why? Because he invited me. Being retired gives you time for these things, going to lunch, making friends, playing little games... And the young man with you? A young man with me? Possibly. I don't remember. I'm sorry. Good to see you. If you feel you're being watched, tell yourself it's probably me. Very reassuring. Kolacskowski? Gesundheit. I also answer to Jeremie. Kolacskowski's fine by me. Well? It stinks. I'm royally fucked. Make sense for once. Max was hired by Marberg. To do what? To kill Nick Costa. Max said that? I was there. He even wants me to help him. You exaggerate. Don't believe me? Why do I bust my ass? Say I believe you. Clue me in, I have to know what to do. Don't worry, we'll tell you exactly what to do. Stay there, I'll call back. - Move and you're dead. - I won't. Gimme your money. - Easy, okay? - Kill the bastard! Here, I'll do it. Don't be stupid, I'm getting my money. Don't shoot. You want to kill me? Try it, little prick. Beat it or I'll shoot you both! Kolacskowski? You took your time. I had interference. Okay. You do the job with Max then you rub him out. Kolacskowski? Are you with me? I kill Max? Kill him how? With the gun we gave you. Whatever. Your choice. My choice. Be careful. If you cross us you got trouble, you know that. Right. It'd do you good. Keep talking. Catch me working out. I'll drop dead first. Set your legs. Keep going. Okay, that's enough. I'm in great shape. Any greater, I'll keel over. One round and we quit. Come on, then. No joke, Max, you're too much. Come on! - Hit me. - What? Go on, hit me. Are you nuts? Fists up. Come on! You okay? Forget it. I told you to hit me, that's what boxing's about. But I didn't follow the rules. Forget it, I said. Does it hurt? Drop the subject, all right? I feel awful, you don't know. - How about something to eat? - I'm not hungry. No need to be. Just a snack. You can't say no, it's on me. Two orders of fries. It sure isn't the country. The smell, right? Doesn't bother me. My nose isn't working up to par. Sorry to come wreck your evening, but it's about Max. I can't see why you want him dead. He hasn't done a thing to you. Not to be a drag, but... I think you're making a mistake. So if Mr. Agopian could reassign me, because... this is Mission: Impossible. Trouble with Kolackowski, he's getting cold feet. Find someone more qualified. Ridiculous... all this upsetting the applecart. The boy's fine... why replace him? Remind him... remind him he asked for work and I agreed to give him... one chance. - Hear that? - Tell him yourself... Maubuisson. Repeat exactly what I said. Let me explain, Mr. Agopian... We can use persuasion if you want him. Of course I do. I made a decision... it's your job... to see it's respected. I didn't mean to cause hassle. Just to say maybe it's not necessary. To kill Max, I mean. If it has to be done... you're the boss. No need for persuasion. - Dad? - Yes? What's that? A machine to shampoo the living room rug. What's wrong with it? It needs shampooing. Impossible. Why? You can't waltz in on Sunday to shampoo my living room which anyway doesn't need it, as no one goes in there. Shit, papa, you go out of your way to be nasty. I don't go out of my way, it comes naturally. You know that by now. And I forbid you to say "shit"! Pour me some coffee. I read an article the other day. Oh? Ex-cops are in big demand at insurance companies. Don't start that or I'll kick you out. You plan for retirement, everyone knows that. I rarely act like everyone. What are you doing at Marberg's? Bad sign, Richard. Leaving hearth and home to work on Sunday. Know where being an eager beaver will get you? No. Just where it got me. Nowhere. It's gone on all morning. The clan is gathering. I'll go nose around. Inspector Almeida, to see Mr. Marberg. Mr. Marberg died at 4 a.m. My condolences. A great loss. Absolutely. For whom? What? A great loss for whom? That's the question. A bonanza for a lawyer, a day like today. I don't know what you mean and you're way out of line. - Allow me to terminate this. - I'll allow it, temporarily. Tell me... Robert Maxandre saw Marberg the other day? Indeed. A friendly lunch, no business? Not to my knowledge. The boy with him? His bodyguard? Max with a bodyguard? No way. Who knows. Maybe a companion. Mr. Maxandre isn't so young. Who says the old need companions? Who is it? Max. Open up. How come you're here? Isn't this where you live? This is a dirty trick. I'm surprised at you. What's eating you now? Ask me my address, don't go spying on me. Give a guy some privacy! You haven't always respected mine. Well, let it go. By the way, here's your ID card. Be more careful in future, if you value your privacy. How'd you get it? It fell out of your pocket at the gym. They called to tell me. Out of my pocket... So I presume. Yeah, like magic. - The pits, huh? - I've seen worse. Bet you had to travel far. Sit down, now you're here. I'll throw some water on my face. You aren't here just for my ID, are you? You forget we have a job. A job. We kill Costa tomorrow. What? So soon? When you see him, you'll understand the hurry. If we wait, time could rob us of our fee. We can at least have breakfast. It's far. How will you do it, with a bazooka? We'll be on the grounds. Right. And to get in, we yell: "yoohoo it's me"? Every morning at ten, Costa takes a dip in the pool. That's our cue. Takes a dip? In this cold? He's off his gourd. Hey... bet he comes out with his nuts shriveled to BBs. But at his age, who'd notice. What's my part in this? Good question. I've always worked solo. What do I need you for? You tell me. Everything's all set. Except one thing. How we leave the grounds once it's over. Talk about a minor detail. - Any ideas? - Me? No. Is that how you plan to earn your money? By not having ideas? To get out... off the grounds, I can organize that. How? Blow something up. A car, a wall, whatever you want. You can do that? Sure. I've done it before. I know. I want to get somewhere in life. I don't want to end up a nobody. Is that wrong? Not at all. Like it? So-so. And that? Better. I'll turn you into a TV junkie. Where'd you learn all that? The library, in books. You read books? That's so surprising? Do I look like a moron? Watch what you're doing. You'll blow up the neighborhood. I suggest you sleep here, on the couch. It'll save time in the morning. Suits me. We'll turn in very soon. Tomorrow we start out at four. Go to bed now? What else? You do your thing. I'll go hang out a bit. - Hang out? - Yeah! Take a walk, look around... Hang out. If I go to bed now, I'll never sleep. Watch TV if you're not tired yet, I'll even watch with you. Don't get all pissed off over me going out for an hour. If I'd left right away, I'd be back by now. Here. Take the key. That way at least you won't wake me up. C'mon, no need to get uptight. Trust me, why don't you? Who is it? Maubuisson. Eugene Agopian's lawyer. Using the term loosely. The old disappear, the young jockey for power. Now the maneuvering begins. I'd give a lot to know why Max is back in harness. Get off my case! I hate this Dick Tracy stuff! Turn the light out, makes me nuts. What happened... did you run into a wall? Don't be funny, you can't hack it. Go to sleep. At your age, you need it. Sit down. We better fix that or it'll hurt like hell tomorrow. Screw tomorrow. It hurts like hell now. I hate people touching me. - Raise your head. - Don't touch me, I said! Son of a bitch, it hurts! I didn't ask for this, leave me be. I'm an asshole... a real asshole. All I do is fuck up. - What happened? - Crazy guys, screwing around. You went to see them? Just guys I ran into, off to some party, and it ended in a riot. You go to bed at nine, doesn't happen to you. If you feel lousy tomorrow, stay here... and wait for me. You need me. Without me, you're in the shit. Would you really care? What kind of talk is that? I don't get you at all. Fine. If you can come, I'd prefer it. It's what we planned. When the truck goes, so do we. Right. This is a good range and angle for me. - Okay for you? - No problem. What does that mean, no problem? It means next time, bring someone to translate. The second charge? Over by that hut. You mean the rotunda? You do your own translations now? Hut, rotunda, whatever. Trust me, it'll blow their socks off. By the time they catch on, Costa's dead. Sounds workable. You bet it's workable. If I don't come back, call the cops. They should tighten up security. I have a feeling they soon will. Can I ask you something? Go ahead. Now you're a pro, but the first time? The first time you killed someone, how did it feel? The first time? I was 18 years old. It was a German officer. Sunday, October 16, 1943, in front of 2,000 people, in a cathedral. Far out! After the Liberation, I was decorated by De Gaulle. Yeah. Gives you a swelled head from the start. Well, I wouldn't put it like that, but... It means the same. No translation needed. Ever kill someone you know? Of course. It's a small world. A friend? No, never friends. For good reason. I never had friends. That's the only way. I think so. There they are. Ready? You ready? Got it all straight? - Of course. - Tell me. Don't hassle me. If you bungle it, I won't wait. I get it. Is that Nick Costa? He's the guy you have to kill? Jesus, why? He's already dead. Be quiet. Good. Very good. Another few strokes... Excellent, now go back. One more length. Very good. Get ready. Okay... now! The wall, quick! Come on! The wall! It's Almeida. Not only the poor live in slums. Your elevator's out. It often is. You actually came here? You used to summon me. Costa's dead. Thought I'd tell you. I'm touched. Classic execution. Almost perfect. Almost? Lots of damage. Whoever did it used explosives. You never touched explosives, Max. Not my style. What's your friend's style? Do you need me? No, I don't think so. How social. Amazing how retirement changes a man. Costa, Marberg... you'll be busy with all these funerals. Yes, Marberg's dead too, didn't you know? Died in bed, less messy. Think so? I don't know. I'd say it's debatable. Don't push your luck, you can slip up like anyone else. Goodbye, Mister... Mister what? Kolaczkowski. Bye, Almeida. Drop in any time. I like to see cops doing their job. Bet he's a fag, your Max. Note that name and quit talking bullshit. Kolo... ends in ski. Not "Kolo," "Kola." "Kolaski," or something. Or "Kolazevski." Shit, what a name. Drink this. I'd say you need it. Who'll pay us now? You have more important worries. Worries? I've got no worries. I thought you had. I'm glad if I'm wrong. Agopian hired me to kill you. I know. You know? Holy shit. No point telling you, then. Since when? From the beginning. If it's true, why? - I wanted to try. - What? Something not on the program. Laugh at me falling on my face. That's really sick. Do you know why Agopian wants me dead? He's not talkative. What happens now? What happens now is... I don't kill you. That's not smart. Agopian will be upset. He can fuck himself! Spoken like a man with balls. Damn right. Balls, but no brains. I hate to tell you this, you won't go far in this game. Easy to make nasty cracks. Think you can just walk away? They'll get someone else, and this one'll have two targets, me and you! It's like you want me to kill you. If you're capable. We'll never know, since I'm not going to try. Do you know what I think? Not only no brains, you have no balls. Fine, I have no balls. I'm not going to argue. I want to know what now? I don't get the question. We have to decide, right? Decide for yourself. No one can do it for you. You mean you'd dump me? If you can't kill me, what can we do together? So, I'm out? You'll leave me in this mess? You saw those cops? Both of them, how they looked at me? I saw. That's all you can say? What should I say? Go to Agopian and turn on the charm. It might work. You score big with old folks. Come on, Max, quit teasing. Don't do this to me. Get off my back, Jeremie. What the hell do you expect? You came to kill me, make money off me, now you moan? Couldn't even finish the job. You can't, Max... you can't. Out, Jeremie. I don't need you. What are you to me? Answer that. Nothing. Not a thing! Not my son or my brother or my buddy! And I'm not complaining. Far from it. Get out of here! Max! No, Max, don't! I didn't do it. Don't shoot! Max! Over here! Come on, this way. Come on. Go! I'll follow. Now! Max? My key, please. Yes, Mr. Maxandre. Thank you. Good night, sir. Thank you. André. Order me a taxi for 6 a.m. tomorrow. - How'd you get in? - Pipe down, people are asleep. You've got nerve. Are you a cop? Where's Jeremie? Jeremie. Get in. The cops are at your place. Cops? What for? Hurry up! Drive! Jeremie? You'll melt in there. About your apartment... I'm sorry. - It's all my fault. - Right. If you'd killed me, I'd have no housing problem. Anyway, I'm sorry. Quit saying sorry all the time. You're right. And quit always saying other people are right. Sorry, but what else can you say? Get dressed. I'm not spending my life here. Son of a bitch, is all that for me? - My safe-deposit box. - Right away, Mr. Maxandre. Jesus... that's a lot of money. I'm not kidding, you're loaded. I have a bit put by. In the briefcase. A bit? This is paradise. How about adopting me? Screw you. What's this? Our insurance policy. Nick Costa? He's not in the book. I haven't been paid. I write it in when I'm paid. Do you ever not get paid? Never. Can I know where we're going? South, where it's sunny. Happy? South? What for? I have a house there. Really? I didn't know. One of many things you don't know. - Know how to drive? - Sure, you think I'm a jerk? Then do so. Max? Do you know what time it is? I'm hungry. - Aren't you? - No. Eat if you want. Nothing here. I looked. Nothing I like. I could pick up some stuff. Go ahead. Can I have money? I'm cleaned out. I'll pay it back when I get my cut. Buy enough for a couple of days. Just in case. In case what? We don't get killed by then. Thank you. - Do you mind a little detour? - Not at all. Start up and go straight. You're the boss. - No need to lock up. I'll watch it. - No problem. In you go. There you are. Hand me the pick. I've almost got it. - What? - The blockage. Drain's full of leaves. Lucky I noticed. What're you doing, daydreaming? There you go! You got food? Meat? A huge steak. Good. We'll cook it outside and eat on the terrace. Outside? That's not a good idea. Sure it is. I'll even open some of my good white wine. Not for me. Gives me a head like a balloon. Wouldn't we be better inside? All warm and cozy? I'll move all this, won't take a second. Too late, the meat's done. Life is weird. Just in general or a specific thing? A specific thing, but in a general way. Max! Pascal! If you kill me now, I'll really be furious! I got the bastards. You did it. If you'd offered to help, I wouldn't've said no. You surprise me. I surprise myself. Agopian picked me up. And don't say you knew. Not a word. Scared me shitless. I decided: too bad, I had to kill you. Rotten, sure, but look at it my way. Think it's fun having them on my ass? What would you have done? The opposite... from the beginning. Hey, listen, that looks bad. You need a doctor. No doctors. I can treat it myself. How? It takes antiseptic, bandages, all that. You can go buy it, right? Max! Max? Kolaczkowski? We paid you a visit recently, you were out. Yeah, sorry. I was beat, so I came down here. Nice spot to rest up. Is Max here? You won't mind if we wait? Go ahead, it's not my place. You'll be here a long time. Why? Max took off. I doubt he's coming back. Did something happen you'd like to tell us about? The fix I'm in... Pardon? Seeing the fix I'm in, if I knew fuck all, cops or not, I'd tell you. No point hanging around here. It's up to you. As you say. Come along. Wait a sec... can you turn on the TV? Do you like the program? Sure, lots of action, no problem. I'll nose around. My pals in Nice might know something. None of my business, but it's not too legit, what you're doing. To hell with the boy, it's Max I'm after. So why lock him up? He's softhearted. He'd love to hook up with the old man again. We can give him a hand, what d'you say? Keep an eye on him. Move over. Sorry. What trash. Shall I change it? No, I like it. It's great. You do go for old folks. Cigarette? No, not between meals. Scared, huh? Don't blame you, I would be too. It's true, we... have to do things sometimes... Look at her. We turn it off, then you can concentrate. That sucks, it was getting good. It's not bad with me, either. I know a game. No problem, chief. Chief? Why chief? I'm no chief. - You will be. - Right. Where's Max? What's the question? I didn't get it, say it again. Listen this time. How come you stuck with him? He needed a pro? A guy who knows explosives? I'm hopeless. I still don't get it. Too bad, I'm out of the game. Now you'll get it. Could you do the other ear? I'm deaf in that one. Forget the medical report. What's with you and Max? Nice shirt. Got it made, haven't you? Max spoils you. You fuck him, is that it? He likes it in the ass? You lose, he fucks me. I can't. I'm missing a cylinder. Feel like charging my battery? That's it, go ahead. Work me over. I'm used to it. You think you're hot stuff? Remember, you could be in my place and me in yours. Me in your place? Not a chance. I'm not the type. It's so special? And what's my type? One who buys his shorts by the dozen from a catalog. You screwed up, pal. You're in a tough spot. Nearer the exit than a promotion. Jesus, you never stop. What does it take to shut you up? It just came in. If you want a punching bag, be my guest. I'll make a price, police special. You couldn't resist. You were itching to rough him up. Well, it doesn't matter. We're ordered back to Paris. And you don't care? You saw. They say "come back", I come back. I'm a cop, can't change your spots. It's all about discipline. Can a cop sit down in a joint like this? A cop like anyone else. A very mixed clientele, despite appearances. I'd hate to cause you one more problem. What problems would I have? Housing, for one. You heard? The gas main. A menace in those old apartments. My daughter wants me to go into insurance. I'll avoid you as a client. You have a daughter? No idea if she's my daughter. Well, she's convinced I'm her father. An old story. I'm going to arrest you, Max. Arrest you... for Nick Costa's murder. - Right now? - No, I'm not quite ready. Forty years, you haven't been quite ready. Time's running out, I'd say. For both of us. And I'm not the only one after you. Maybe. I wouldn't know. You're in for a few surprises. You should've seen, the day Marberg died. All new faces. They wouldn't have pleased you. You like television, Almeida? I loathe it. It's funny... I've had the occasion to watch it lately and everyone talks like you. Thank you. Tempted? I'm more a ham sandwich and pickles man. We found a lost friend of yours. I thought you might like him back. Did he cut his face falling out of bed? More or less. You police types haven't evolved much. What you did, that was rotten. - What did I do? - Ran out on me. I left you money and the car. I thought you were long gone. Screw the money and screw the car! You ran away. We needed an idea. That was one. A bad one. So you don't have many friends. You could've made an exception. Oh fuck it, I'm a jerk. Like you always say. You took off because it suited you. That's that. End of story. The money's where it was, I didn't touch it. Keep my cut, I don't care. Dammit. Shut up for once. Sit down. Listen. I left because I saw no other solution. I thought it was best for us both. I thought... never mind what I thought. You're here. If you want us to stay together, fine. That's what I want. Admit it, Max. You almost fouled out. My sinusitis is back. - Get an aspirin on the plane. - Aspirin burns my stomach. No, I need to have something. Save me a seat. I'll join you. Take my suitcase, I'll go faster. I'd like shaving cream, a razor and a comb. You could answer it. Why? It's not for me. You can say hello. Hello, yes, it's me. You understand Italian now? Starsky and Hutch, I'd understand in Chinese. Who was on the phone? Things are starting to move. I have a lunch date. You'll fix 'em. They'll come crawling, no problem. You're wrong. There may be big problems. Why? We have the notebook. The little black book, our insurance. You'll make 'em scream bloody murder. Don't say that word. It makes me nervous. Max! I have no clothes, they really fucked me over. Can't eat out like this. So, you're coming? What do you think? From now on, I'm your shadow. I'm sorry, but the notebook is of no use to us. You're bargaining with an empty hand, you see that? No, not very well, I'm afraid. I'm a simple man. I'm not used to this lawyer talk. You're shamming. You want to divide us and it's no go. Age doesn't excuse everything. Your belated passion for this young man doesn't give you free license. What an idea, to blackmail us. Consider the position you put us in. Agopian put out a contract on me. An old man's whim. He was sure one day we'd pay you to kill him. When all is said and done... that notebook only implicates you. Murders, sordid executions... shocking, when you think of it. It could land a man behind bars. Maybe. I never think about it. We'll help you think every minute of every day. You're unpredictable, Max. We want the notebook. Fuck 'em! It's bullshit. Shut up, Jeremie... We'll wait for your answer. No hurry. We'll drop you in town and the boy stays with us. It's best, don't you think? I won't negotiate for battered merchandise. Really, Max, you're woefully out of date. Shall I have the shirt laundered? No, I'll take care of it. It's nice sometimes just to hang out and watch TV, right? Shut up, for God's sake. It's a bitch. I have to go again. Isn't something missing? What? Kolaczkowski. Don't tell me you lost him again. I miscalculated. They kept Jeremie. You called your shot, bringing the kid back. Who is he? Where did you get him from? I didn't get him anywhere. He just showed up one day. Agopian hired him to murder me. And you didn't kill him then and there? No. I even gave him a chance to carry it out. You wanted him to kill you? No. I was curious to see how he'd handle it. I saw, all right. Totally incompetent. I was tired, Almeida. I can't explain it. And afterward? How did it go afterward? With Jeremie. Afterward? It's terrible, you get used to it. Can't make a move on your own. I'd have done better to get a dog. When do you retire? I try to ignore it. In six months. Would you like to go out in glory? Put me away for good? Got the notebook? Where's Jeremie? Put this on. What is it? You never saw a tie? Sure. But I don't know how to tie it. Christ, what a dork! You're unreal. I hate to say this, but Max'll never bring the notebook just for me. Police. Go back to your friends. We'll discuss this later. Come along, Max. Max? Hurry, I'd rather not see the kid. "The kid." You keep saying that. How old is he? I don't know, 25 or 26. Then he's not a kid. I wasn't far off base, all in all. Not much, no. Your whole life's in here. I wouldn't know. I never bothered to re-read it. March 4th, you'll think of me. I'm sorry? I joined the force March 4th, I'm leaving it March 4th. Funny thing, bureaucracy. I'll think of you, if it'll make you happy. What would make me happy is if I still wanted to nail you. What's eating you? I feel I'm locking up a man with a family. It depresses me. I don't feel like reading it, either. Go after Jeremie. Without you, he'll never find the exit. Where are you going? Almeida! Filthy cop! What did you do with Max? The kid... You shouldn't have taken Max. You can't jail him. No need to jail him. He's done for with a klutz like you. Quiet or I'll slaughter you. Be careful! Poor Max. Shut up, shut your stinking cop mouth! Kill a cop, that's the limit. What a jerk. Max... I'm a dope. Even I can't stand myself. What must it be for you? Up to now I did asshole things, but nothing major. This beats every record. Say something. It's worse when you don't talk. What would it change? Try it anyway. It might help. Maybe Almeida wanted out, in any case. He simply chose his moment. There, does that help? Maybe. I'm not sure I get it. But don't explain. I'll figure it out myself. Think those bastards will get us? Probably. Sooner or later. We won't hand it to them on a platter. We'll make them sweat, the pricks. I don't like it when you swear. You should watch it. Right. I'll be careful. Want a cup of coffee? If you can find one. No problem. Consider it done. Oh shit! Subtitles by Anne Brav
