There's an emergency in the laboratory and a serious risk of contamination. Have the emergency squad sent here right away! Repeat serious risk of contamination. Close all safety doors. Only the emergency squad is to enter the laboratory. Notify professor Adams and professor Vince at once. Apply all measures of maximum security. As president of chemi-Cal, I would say yes this report seems to be sufficient. The ministry will accept out version of the affair. And we don't have to say anything about the risk of contamination. There's no point in causing alarm. That's impossible, Mr. Milton. Don't forget the people in Newton suspect something. Yes that's very true. And I would say they are definitely against the kind of experiment we're performing. They won't find out about it. After all it was accidental. But inexplicable at least for now. Isn't it Vince? Oh yes! Jane, I think we'll make more progress in our research programs if you please leave this whole affair to me. If professor Adams agrees it's all right by us. I'm glad to hear it. The problem is simply professor Adams. Hi Betty. Hi Lucas. I nearly didn't get here. You been to your sister's? Yeah that's right. Are you coming for a - no I can't. I've got to be back at six. It's just a short ride. - You promise? Sure. -All right don't forget. Look out! Here's the data we processed. The problem isn't the disappearance of professor Adams. This isn't the first weekend he's spent fishing. The problem is the disappearance of the Guinea pig. Guinea pig? Theoretically the vaccine may have produced profound genetic alterations in the creature's body. Probably it has grown in size as well as ferocity. How big? The dimensions of a dog of a lion. For the moment this is just an hypothesis. It will take several hours to process all the data. But get ready for the worst. Professor Adams prepared us notes only about the methodology of his experiments not the results. Vince and I know almost nothing about the new vaccine. Well we must keep our heads Jane. Chemi-Cal is closed for the weekend. The personnel know nothing so there's no way they can spread damaging stories. But Mr. Milton! You're forgetting about the auxiliary squad men. Yes. You better get back to work. I'll see if I can track down professor Adams. And I'll have a word with sergeant o'brien to see if the local police can help us out. Yes? Yes I'll send him right over. Of course sir. You heart that? The colonel wants the printout right away. You better get moving. Yes. You know the town of Newton captain? I know the one near my home town in Canada. No this one's in england. However the prime minister is anxious to see the report on the plurima plan after the issue was rose last week in parliament. And chemi-Cal is acting mysteriously. How 'bout professor Adams? The professor is a scientist you know. And he likes to deal in certainties. But Milton would have no objection to getting rid of us. Officially chemi-Cal makes only asprin and antibiotics. He thinks the plurima plan is a pain in the neck. A pain he can stand. He made about 10 million didn't he from the government? A few hours ago there was a curious accident at the laboratory and professor Adams the only person who could have explained it has disappeared. He's supposed to have gone fishing. Fishing? Are you sure? Captain, if I accepted everything I was told at face value I wouldn't be running a security service; I'd be directing traffic. Well, I'd better be going. Uh colonel who was Adams' bodyguard? Henry Myles. Hm I've worked with him. Yes? Hm. Sergeant, we found the girl's body. It's in dreadful shape. It's over there. I'll show you. Just look. I never would have thought a human being could do such a thing. This is really horrible. I can't think what kind of weapon the killer used on her. But the way she's cut up it could've been a meat ax. Doctor, I want the results of the autopsy tonight! Right. This is our case! And I want this killer in jail before those London head shrinkers start excusing him! So get going! So it was one of these things that created all the mess huh? There are some things that even science cannot understand. It takes time for the mind to accept them as possible. I see. Do you mind if I call you Jane? I'd mind if you didn't. Fine. What can you tell me about this professor Adams? You fellas think that people aren't interesting until they disappear. Hm. You don't have to disappear. So, according to your story the professor is off struggling with a trout. After all, biology trout fishing is his biggest passion. Hm. Wait in the car while I look around. Not the best way to treat a lady. I told you to stay in the car, lady Jane! It's dangerous not to follow orders. I think we'd better let some light in, hm? Well it looks like his things are all here. No not everything. His old military jacket isn't there. You're observant. He always puts it on when he's fishing. I think I'll just take a look around. You recognize him? - It's Henry Myles! He was guarding the professor! Yes I used to know him. Come on. Perfect, wonderful! You've been marvelous today, boys! Now you can go, but first I have something for you. One for you. One for you. One for you, and say hello to granny for me. And be a good boy. See you tomorrow. And don't forget to study. - I won't. All right boys, time to go home. Your mommies and daddies are waiting for you. They're expecting you back for dinner. And wash your grubby little hands before you eat, eh? I say boys, haven't you forgotten something? Come and get it. Easy does it. And remember, don't stop to play along the way. This substance we found on Henry Myles' body has a completely anomalous cell structure. That isn't the point, Jane. In my opinion there's a connection between the murders, the accident in the laboratory and the disappearance of professor Adams. Perhaps. But you have to prove it. Look Jane! You have to cooperate with me if we're going to find out the truth. And that's more important than the good name of your dear professor Adams. Mr. Milton wants to see you. All right. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes come in. Captain kirk, sergeant o'brien. How do you do? I've been told the whole story, captain. I hope I can be of help. Not alone are you? I'm sorry but I only have two men under me and they're busy chasing a homicidal maniac. Then you can't be of much help can you? - Thank you sergeant for taking the suggestion I gave you. We must avoid a panic. And above all else we mustn't attract journalists looking for sensational news. Yes but I think the people should be warned. Yes but perhaps later on. And captain remember the overriding necessity: That the plurima plan remain a matter of utmost secrecy. Come in! I didn't know you were busy. No no not at all. How are you, captain? - Fine thanks. Ah sergeant o'brien. - How do you do? The computer report is finished. But perhaps it's better if I come back later. No no you can speak freely. I don't want these gentlemen to think we have anything to hide. All right. We had the computer set up to analyze all the information available concerning professor Adams' with the new vaccine. And as expected the reply was 'insufficient data'. Insufficient? If you would like you can check it yourself. If you gentlemen would excuse me, come along professor. Dreadful actors, don't you agree? What do you mean? All right. What if there's a connection between the accident in the laboratory the disappearance suddenly of the professor and the killings? Sergeant before we find it we have to find the professor. As you can see the area is quite large. We'd need volunteers for a manhunt but then we'd have to offer an explanation. And that could easily cause panic if it got the general public. Yeah, and that's not the only problem. We haven't got much time. Why not captain? When we find Adams you'll see, okay? Hello? Oh, it's you honey! What a pleasant surprise! No, no, I never go to bed this early. I was just gonna have a nice shower. You didn't phone me last night, ducky. Is that how you're feeling? I am if you are. But don't you keep me waiting. Put your skates on. See ya! As you can see she was killed in the same way as the previous case. And look at this photo. You see? There's the green stuff again. Then you think there's no doubt about it; the man who killed this girl also killed the other one? That's right, sergeant. And there was another curious feature. Did you notice that in both those cases there was hardly any blood left in the corpses? In the first case that can be explained; the ground she was lying on had soaked it all up. And this time the killer cleaned the bathroom floor? Some maniacs are like that. Although I know you don't believe the killer's insane. And do you? Who knows? The wounds resemble those caused by an animal. And then there were those strange sores. I'd say they were burns caused by that green substance. Burns, you say? Or it could even have been radiation. I've noted symptoms like those caused by heavy contamination. Apparently this killer whether it's a man or animal is a kind of mutant. And as for the blood he may very well have drunk it. Let him through. Have you seen the papers this morning? Yes, it's scandalous! But you can't stop the press. However, I did send someone to deal with it. Good morning, sir Charles! Good morning, Rutledge. Come and meet frye of civil defense. How do you do? - Pleasure. I've called you because of what's happening at Newton. We have news. Doctor, would you please explain? Gladly. One of the doctors there sent us some cultures. We've managed to isolate a virus. It's a new type of virus and we're still studying it. But one thing is certain: It's indestructible and very dangerous. Perhaps at Newton they're doing experiments in germ warfare. That'll be all, doctor. Thank you very much. You may go now. Can I offer you something to drink Rutledge? As you must have understood, colonel we've told no one that Adams was nearing the conclusion of his experiment. Naturally, sir Charles. There you are. You see colonel we were well aware of the risks the deployment plan involved but we still had to carry out the experiment. Unfortunately, something failed to function correctly and we are now faced with the possibility of an immense catastrophe. Do you think it's already reached that point, sir Charles? Three minutes ago the first part of plan q was given the go ahead. But sir Charles! The position doesn't warrant plan q! You can't be serious maintaining that point of view! It means the total destruction of the town murdering every living thing in it including women and children! That's enough colonel! Leave the responsibility to me. Sir Charles, I urge you to reconsider on the grounds of humanity. Please control yourself! This isn't the first time we've incurred certain risks. Do you expect to move ahead with the second phase? I'm forced to say yes. Fortunately, it's not up to me to choose the zero hour. That's done by our superiors. How about the press, sir Charles? I shall muzzle them! Is that possible? The arrival of troops at Newton will look very suspicious. We'll make a statement to the press say army maneuvers. You can see to the details. If you say so. All right file out! Set up a road block! On the double! Come on get the led out! So we now have the problem of quarantining the town's entire population. But colonel have you read my report? This situation is serious. Naturally, naturally. Have you learned anything about the virus and professor Adams? The professor's disappeared but the virus hasn't. Colonel, this virus is deadly! That's the main reason I told you. Any other information? Colonel, do you realize that this'll be the first time you've used plan q? What do you mean, captain? You know exactly what I mean, sir! Don't worry, and calm down. The authorities have assured me that it won't be necessary. Yes, but what if they're wrong? What if the virus spreads? This whole town could become a cemetery! Now captain you're exaggerating. And be careful of startling a panic too! I want you to remember that you're the only person who can really handle the situation. I'm no superman colonel. This is no time for modesty. You have to eliminate the source of the contagion because it endangers the whole world! No one is to enter or to leave the town. And you may use your gun if necessary. It's been authorized. You may use your gun if necessary. Do you understand captain? Yes sir. I got it. Hello? Hello? Why don't they answer? I don't know what's going on. Out of the way! You stay here. Mrs. hatcher! That one working? I was talking to my wife and the line went dead. That's funny. - So long. Let's get on with it. This place gives me the creeps. Sure does. You really think this is where we'll find professor Adams. If he's still alive. Let's look in there. Be careful it might collapse. That way. My god! Listen Tess are you sure you really want to go to a movie? If I'm not mistake it was your idea. Yeah but we could-- - come on Paul. Okay. That's just to begin with. If you want the rest you have to earn it. Now what you want? One of those huge ice cream cones from the jumbo bar. But it's too far away it'll take me ages! Don't be silly, it's just down the street. And it's worth it because I'm gonna thank you in a special way. Hm. You promise? Mm-hm. Stand aside, let us through, out of the way! I wouldn't go in there if I were you. Look! Tess! What's going on sergeant? Why is the town being cut off? The phones and the TV don't work either. What's it all about, sergeant? Calm down and stop worrying. For the moment there's no information. Let me through. No siree, you're not going anywhere till you've told us everything you know! Go back to your houses! This is an emergency! I'm unable to give out information. You're not fobbing me of with dumb excuses! Just a moment please! You can't shoot all of us! Let's not make this business worse than it is. Sergeant for goodness sake tell us what's happening! Yeah we got a right to know what's going on! Let him speak, not you! You're not giving a chance to get a word out. Sergeant, please! Excuse me. Can't you see? They do whatever they feel like! I say we can't go on like this! There's no use losing our tempers! They'll tell us sooner or later! Just be patient! Will you please all be patient?! Anyway let's not hang around here in case that thing comes back! Why can't they tell us something? I have very important information for the minister. But it's impossible that you can't get in touch! No listen! Say it concerns the plurima plan. Yes. I'll stay here. Please have him call me. Thanks. You home daddy? Hi! How are you doing kids? Did you have a good time? Oh yes, it was super. Really super? - Mm-hm. You know what? Everybody says there's some kind of maniac running around. Uh-huh everybody says so. - Ls it true?! All right girls go and get ready for dinner. All right. - Off you go. Goodnight! - Night. - Night. - Night night. Did you have a talk with the minister? No not yet. Do you think there's really any danger? I doubt it dear. Only I'd be a lot happier if you'd take the children up to London. And you? Oh I'd love to go, only I have to remain here till they find that fellow, Adams. Extra! Extra! Late night extra! Disaster in Newton! Local police helpless! Read all about it! Deadly virus at chemical plant! Panic spreading at Newton! Pm sends in troops! It's me sir. Yes, I've read them. I gave the orders. But of course sir. We sacrificed one thousand lives today to save millions. That's just the point. 12 hours, yes of course. It could be a bit long but I think the security cover will hold. Don't worry, I'll keep you informed. Gentlemen. The zero hour has been set for exactly five o'clock tomorrow morning. For god's sake Jane, face the facts! All right kirk, it's possible that that virus alters living material. I want to check. Look, there was just one man closely connected with the experiment: Your boss, professor Adams! Why won't you admit it? And he's the monster who rips his victims apart and drinks their blood! I'll explain it to you again. There's no proof. I just have to find out if this is a contagious virus that's all. Jane! Smith, call army headquarters. Yes sergeant. We'll prepare for the worst. I think they've cut the line. No no. What's happening to us? Everybody's going crazy! No, the state of emergency isn't my worry. I'm sorry. I want to get my family right out of Newton. No, I said no! I'm not interested! Then get the authorization from the prime minister from the queen for anybody you like it doesn't matter! But if you refuse I shall get in touch with the press and see that everyone learns exactly what's happening in this town because you wanted these dangerous experiments! Got that? Hello?! Hello?! Hello?! James! James! Into the sacristy quick! Run! What is it this time? Another victim? I'll explain everything along the way captain. We're in a dreadful mess. People are going around with weapons. If the soldiers try to stop them they'll start shooting. Look captain, the army undoubtedly has a radio. You could call your superiors and ask them to life the roadblock. Waste of time. Sarge, there they are! I hope we can keep it from getting out of hand. Hey sergeant! - Yeah? What's up? Turn back turn back! There's military roadblock. Nobody goes through! Take up your positions. Step on it now! It's just an army exercise. There's no danger so go back home! Plug in the megaphone. - Yes, sarge. Your attention please. Your attention please. This is colonel Rutledge of the army information service speaking. For reasons of national security this town is in quarantine for a period not exceeding 20 days. I repeat, this town is in quarantine for a period not exceeding 20 days. Attention please, attention please. If anyone attempts to force the roadblock we will be obliged to open fire. We ask for your cooperation in avoiding violence. These measures are for your own safety. Please remain calm. I repeat, these measures are for your own safety. Please remain calm. Give 'em a warning flare, will you? Get back in your cars! There's nothing to worry about! It's all right! Go on back get back in your cars! Don't try anything! Okay. Have it your own way. Go ahead. Aim 10 yards ahead of them. - Right, sergeant. Fire straight at them. Fire! Help! Help! Help! Help! Go back home I tell you! Go back home! Fire over them. - Yes, sergeant. Go on, move! Keep moving, keep moving! That way, that way! How is that fella? Nothing serious let's go! Right. Who is it? Open the door. It's us! What is it? What have you come back for? They wouldn't let us through at the road block. You'll just have to stay. They call it a cleaning up operation which means that they wipe out every living thing; humans animals everything. I can't believe it. In military logic it's the one sure way of getting rid of the virus. For them it's mathematical; better to kill a thousand people today than a million later. Isn't there a way we can stop this? If we can convince them that we have an antidote within five hours. This is all top secret. Of course captain. Don't forget it. Get in your room! Daddy! Barricade the door! Daddy! While working on the cellular tension of that substance found on the victims' bodies we can halt the spread of the virus. Then you've found the antidote. In theory yes. What does that mean? We have to wait for the Guinea pig's reaction in three or four hours. As far as we know isn't Adams the only carrier of the virus? Yes, since all his victims are dead. So if we eliminate him that stops all danger of contagion right? I suppose it must. I'm sorry for him. But we'll have to kill him. Let's go. So long. Come on. Oh what do you want?! I ain't done nothing! I think. Go on home, sleep it off. It's you, sergeant! How are you doing? Care for a quick one or are you on duty? Go on, run along! Sergeant o'brien, sergeant o'brien. You're wanted at the Milton home. Hello beautiful. Yes, this is o'brien. Yes sergeant. I'll be right there. Something's happened to the Miltons. Let's go! - Right! So long. Captain. The sergeant would like to see you downstairs. Okay. Here. Have you found anything? Not much. He must have got out this way. My men didn't see him leave the house. And there are traces of blood and that green substance. Milton fired a shotgun at him; two barrels of hunting shot. What'll it take to stop him, a missile? Hm. What are you doing? I want to follow him. I forbid you to, it's crazy! And you don't know how to kill him anyway. I know I don't, but I have no choice. Come on. Care for a drink mate? Stuck up bastard! Captain! He almost got you. Yes, sure did. You're wounded! No, the monster's bleeding. Lucky I came looking for you. O'brien, I owe you a beer. Look at this: The abandoned factory, that woman's house, the cinema and the Milton's. Now we know how he gets from one part of the city to another. Yes, you see captain this area of town is riddled with tunnels that connect with the sewer system. They're part of an ancient Roman drainage scheme. That's what they say anyway. Well whatever they were, how many exits are there from these tunnels? There are ways out all around the city. Evening captain. Evening Ross, flight plan for you. Control tower to kangaroo 297 engage manual control systems. Proceed Ross. Yes sir. All set, captain. Kangaroo 297 request permission to approach. Control tower to kangaroo 297 you may enter approach to runway. How's the cargo? Loading has been completed, captain. Okay, give it the gas. Ready, captain. We finished sealing up the exit sergeant. There's no way he can get out of here now. We can be sure of that. Now we have to flush him. The problem is the method. There's fire of course. No. Just a minute. If we filled the tunnels with some kind of gas chemi-Cal must have once. Chemi-Cal. Yeah. We should of thought of them before. They can provide the best solution, no doubt about it. Come on with me. You too. It worked with the Guinea pig. Now it can cure professor Adams. Oh no Jane. Use your head. It's impossible. We can't even get close to him in the condition he's in. I'll do it. You'll do nothing of the kind. Listen to me before you say anything. I found the antidote and I'm sure it'll work. It only took an hour to act on the Guinea pig. For a man it should only take three or for hours. You really care about professor Adams don't you? My interest is for the whole human race. But we haven't enough time. Why not? Because in one and a half hours we'll all be dead. I see. Thank you. It's all ready, sir Charles. The plane will take off at the time we agreed. Officially we're saying it's a normal training flight over the north sea. And how will you arrange the accident? At 7:50 the plane will be 30 miles from the coast and two minutes from the objective and at that point theoretically there will be an engine failure. The captain and navigator will bail out after setting the automatic pilot. How precise is it? It's as accurate as a missile sir Charles; the precision of a chronometer. Extremely clever of you. Thank you sir Charles. Kangaroo 297 to control tower. Any final instructions for our mission? Control tower to kangaroo 297 you are authorized for takeoff. The captain may now open the sealed orders. Wind is calm northwest, temperature 15 degrees. Is something wrong captain? Er no nothing the usual orders. Let's move. A nerve gas bomb. Why that's just awful! Do you think that public opinion will accept it? They know what they're doing. It's sabotage that will pass as an accident. And there won't be very many witnesses in a tomb. It's atrocious inhuman! It's the logic of power. Don't forget that. Professor take me to the strongroom. I need two units of necron. It is impossible that you people know about it. No. No way. I must refuse to oblige unless you force me. Please kirk, I know I can still save him if I go with you. There's not a hope, and you're not coming. Stay here! There. We're almost over the objective, captain. Do these tunnels lead to the sewers? Yes. Here, give me that. The old drainage network empties directly into the sewer system. I know it by heart and so does professor Adams. We're both members of the civic works commission. Right you two go that way. You come along with me. Yes sir. Come on. Captain did you hear that? I think he's up ahead. Go on. Put it on automatic. Is there something the matter sir? Not a thing. Nothing we can possibly change anyway. Cigarette? No thanks. Listen do you mind if I ask you a question captain? Go ahead. Why have you stayed here with us? You could've got away easily. Adams stinks like this place. I want to see him dead. O'brien here do you read me? Yes sergeant o'brien. Have you found anything over there. No, nothing so far. Well keep in contact. I'll keep the switch open. Would that be okay? Come on. It's almost impossible to breathe captain. Yeah you're right, but we've got to go on. Give me the radio. Here. O'brien! What is it captain? Have you found anything. No we haven't seen a thing. But brown can't go on. We have to find him! We've only got half an hour! These fumes are gonna poison us. Look sergeant, we can't stop now! Don't worry I'm with you. Brown you'd better get out of here before you collapse. I'll go on. Come on this is it! Professor? Professor? Look out! It's broken. I'll go on ahead okay? And you call o'brien all right? No captain I want to be in on the kill with you. Hello kirk? Captain? Sergeant o'brien come in, I'm not reading you. Come in please. Can anyone hear me? Professor Adams? Professor? I know you're here professor. Come out please so I can see you. I'm Jane, your assistant. Don't you recognize me now? Trust me professor. I've come here to help you believe me. I don't want to hurt you. There are men who want to kill you professor. I can help you. Help me. Look. This is the antidote. Help me. I don't want to die. Let me try. Come over here, professor. Help me Jane. You understand me, don't you? Jane Jane where are you?! No! No! No! Kirk! Help me help me! Come on Jane hurry! We have only a few minutes to notify London. Kangaroo 297 here come in. This is kangaroo 297, please answer. Please answer! I might have known it! Prepare to abandon the aircraft. Abandon it?! We're abandoning the plane; Those are orders. What about the cargo? Shut up will you? And make sure we leave it on automatic. Yes sir. In two minutes we bail out. Captain listen! Ross it's all over!
