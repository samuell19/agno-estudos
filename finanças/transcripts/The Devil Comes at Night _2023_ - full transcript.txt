Come on its okay. Okay, go on through. Sober up, lock everything. I don't think we were followed. Focus-focus, I got to go back, try to unfuck this mess. You stay in, keep the lights off. Shit, just find the damn safe; be ready to go when I get back. Jack? What-what? No-no-no-no-no-no-no. Hey big fella, hey, come on, snap out of it. Come on, wake up, wakey wake. You got this, come on. Uh, shit. Okay, buddy, you'll find this when you wake up. Oh, good-good. I'll be back. Oh, uh, Jack? Hello? What the? "Ah!" Hello? Jack? Uh, uh, ah, uh. What happened? Oh. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Okay-okay What the fuck, Jack. Sorry, did I just spook you there? Just being nosey neighbors. Hi. We're so sorry. We heard yelling, we knocked, but -- We thought someone was hurt. Oh, uh, I'm sorry about that. I, um -- I hurt my hand. Uh-huh. Ben Rakes. Lisa. And this is my arm-candy, Ted. Join us on the porch for a get-to-know-you-drink, neighbor? Oh, that's -- it's really nice, and I-I don't wanna be rude. Then don't be. Moving in without meeting the neighbors doesn't fly here. I promise we aren't total hicks. Yeah, all right. All right. All right. Oh, we're sorry about all all the barking. We rescue strays, and then get pissed when mommy and daddy aren't home. Oh, that's what all the yelling was about. Rough moving day? Uh, yeah. I don't really know how that happened. Appreciate the distraction. It's been a strange night. I'm sorry if we made it any stranger, we're a few in already. Oh, don't scare him away, he just bought the place. Actually, this is my father's place. Hmm, invite him to come down and join us. Does he nurse his beers like you? He died two weeks ago, car accident. Oh, shit. Ben, I am so sorry. Uh, it's all right. Seriously, it's-it's fine, we weren't close. He traveled a lot for work, and I wasn't great at keeping in touch. I didn't know he retired up here till after he passed. Uh-huh, well, I'm sure Arthur is happy you got the place. Sorry, I didn't realize you knew him. Oh, we didn't. Uh, car accident was in the paper. Not much news in this small town, I can't believe we never met him. Yeah, it's-it's weird. I think --. Shit, you got a big one. Ted? Oh, sorry. Hey, I'm sorry for your loss. We're just happy to meet a new neighbor. This is temporary, I'm just here to sort through his things, settle his affairs. And soon as I'm done I'm heading out. Can't be that bad being back in your hometown? I grew up with my mom; it's my first time here. But your father, his family was from here. I don't know, could be. Lisa likes to play town historian. Well, why would his father retire here if he wasn't from here? Like I said, I wasn't great at keeping in touch. Well, maybe we knew your grandfather. What was his name? I never met him. Well, you know his name. Uh, Grandpa Rakes. Uh, like I said, I-I never met him. Think for a second. Too intense, sorry, I just get really excited about history. It's all good, yeah; I wish you could tell me more. Uh, we need more beer. Yes. Uh, well, my father kept some in the fridge, uh, you can help yourself. You know, come to our house, we got tons of drinks. You know, nah, it's-it's been a long night. We're just to those trees, come over for one drink. Full disclosure, I don't drink. I shouldn't have let you open this one. Uh, time to call it a night. Sorry for the beers, uh, come over for a snack, just meet the doggies. Tomorrow. What, our house isn't good enough for you? What? No-no, it's nothing like that. Hey, shut up, Ted. Ben, just come, don't leave me with this drunk. Come on, don't be a dick, Ben. It's not a big deal. You know what, and nothing personal, but, uh-uh I think we just call it goodnight now. What, you afraid of the dark, Ben? There's nothing out here. Okay. Nothing out here. He's right, there's nothing to be scared of. Goodnight, Lisa. Ben! Ben! Jack? Hey, can you hear me? Jack, what the hell's going on? Can you hear me? Jack? Did you find it? Jack, you're breaking up. God damn it, fucking phones. Jack? Yeah, hold on. Jack? Fuck. Jack, what's happening? Where are you? Listen, it's bad here. Wa-what's happening? The sheriff is helping them out search houses. I ain't see the black car. What? Why? Fuck, they're coming towards the car. Look, uh, I got to hide. Jack, are you all right, Jack? Shit. Jack-Jack, are you there? Yeah-yeah, I -- I'm good for now. You lied to me, you son of a bitch. Talk to me, Jack. I drove six hours to come here, you told me you were sober, promised me you could handle this. I am sober, I swear. Yeah. Look, I was waiting for you at the bar, I ordered dinner, and then I can't remember. Yeah, well, you were hammered when I got there. That can't be. You were outta control, fighting two racist hicks. Now, you know what happens with people like you in this kinda town. Well, you broke your hand shattering a guy's jaw. For Christ sake, I barely got you out of the bar. Shit. So, I came back, I thought I could talk to someone, calm things down, but they're acting crazy. Who? Everyone. Looks like half the town is looking for you. I've never seen anything like this before. We've gotta get out of here. We can't leave until I find the money. You haven't found the safe yet? Not yet. Look, just get back here and help me look. Look, these guys are serious about hurting you. Welcome to my world. Just get back here, please. Yeah-yeah-yeah, when I'm sure they can't follow me. Look, you stay hidden. Christ almighty -- oh, shit -- Jack... Jack? Shit. Fuck this town. All right, come on, Mr. Safe, where are you? Hello? Somebody here? You've got to be kidding me. Oh, hell no. Hey-hey, the fuck you doing? I'm talking to you. Putting a scarecrow in the field. Yeah, and who told you to do that? Arthur. Arthur is dead, man. Still paid me to do it. Well, this is my house now, and I'm telling you I don't want the scarecrow. Well, you're welcome to pay me to take it down, might have an opening next week. Who are you? Mason, people need things done around here they call me. Well, Mason, I'm gonna need you to take that scarecrow and fuck off. Arthur paid me for a scarecrow, I'm gonna put it up. Or you can come down out of that house and hit me with that bat. This fun to you, fucking with me? Just giving you options, tough guy. Is this really how you want your night to go? Come here; attack me with your bat. Okay. Okay, Mason, put up your scarecrow, I'll enjoy watching you work for me. What the hell? Jack Attack Boxing. Leave a message. Jack, where are you, man, shit is getting way too crazy out here. Hello? Hello? Well, you better believe I'm not in the mood for this shit. Who the fuck is in my house? Go away. Go away? This is my house, who the fuck are you? Arthur's friend. You're trespassing. Go away. Okay, Arthur's friend, I'm Ben Rakes, Arthur's son. Bullshit, Arthur didn't have a son. We weren't close. I'm not surprised he didn't mention me. But he did leave the house to me. Come on, how many black guys come through this town? What was your mother's name? Ellie Rakes. You're like twice Arthur's size. Ellie fed me well. Look, I'm not trying to scare you; I just wanna know what's going on here. Think of me as a skunk, I won't make it stink if you don't mess with me. I'm not gonna mess with you; I didn't even know you'd be here. Okay, all right. Let's just, uh -- Move. Well, where you going? I have to pee. Flashlight? And make sure you put the tap on. I've been hiding up here since your friend dragged you in. Who are you? Amy. Your dad was part of the seniors' club I run at the library. Seniors' club? Yeah, uh, a-a club for seniors. There's a lot of resources in town for older folks, so volunteers check up on them and take them to the library and stuff. Your dad gave me keys, by the way. I didn't break in. Yeah, but why are you hiding in his house? I thought it was empty. I'm sorry about your dad passing. He-he was a nice guy. Just tell me why you're here. You're gonna think I'm crazy. Bit late for that. Just tell me. Were you in town? Did-did you notice people acting weird? Weird? And it's been weird for about two weeks, it's always at night, screams in the woods, people are setting fires. Two people went missing today. Shit. So, I just thought I'd come out of town and hide here before it got dark. I have some bad news for you; here is the last place you wanna be. Why? I don't know about the last two weeks, but tonight, I got some folks looking for me. Looking for you, what did you do? I don't know. Jack says I won a bar fight against the wrong white guy. Oh, Jesus Christ. Who's Jack? A friend. He's the guy who brought me here after the bar, uh. Look, you should go. Well, I-I didn't drive here, and I'm not walking in the dark, so. Jesus. Oh shit, shit. Oh. That motherfucker. What is that? I think my old pal Mason is back. Wait-wait, Mason Banks is here? You know that asshole? Shit, don't make him angry, he's dangerous. Pretty sure I just knocked out his buddy. No, I'm-I'm being serious, I've seen him hurt people. He's probably on something, he's fucked up. He's probably just an asshole. He's probably just an asshole. Listen to me, don't go out there, it's what he wants. How's your buddy's jaw doing, Mason? Hold this; I don't wanna break it too. Don't. Close the door. Close the door. Oh darn. Come here, Mason. Come here. Got you. Oh, fuck, Ted, what the fuck? What the fuck is right, what is this spooky thing? And why are you here? What are you doing here? Look, we live next door. What? We heard yelling from our bedroom window. What the hell is going on? Sorry, I, uh -- You know what, I can't hear you. Come to the door. Uh-huh, okay-okay-okay. Hey, you okay? No, Mason is here, he's causing trouble. Mason is here. Shit, I hate that fucking guy. Listen; maybe you should come hang with Lisa and me until we figure this all out. Hey, get away from them. Come after me. Get away from her. Be right back. Oh-oh -- oh god. Oh fuck. You're gonna, fucking, let go. Go. Ahhh! Oh, oh my god. Oh my god... I don't know what to do. I've got my bag, my bag. What? Get my fucking gym bag. There's-there's clean wraps inside next to my boxing gloves. Okay. Okay-okay-okay. Okay, what do I do? Wrap my fucking arm. Okay-okay-okay, calm down, calm down, calm down. Calm down, just, uh -- okay. Okay, all right. All right, okay. I need you to keep going even if I pass out. No-no-no, you are not leaving me to do this alone. Stay awake, okay? Just talk to me, talk to me. There was someone else with Mason out there in the dark. What? I couldn't see properly, but he was fucking huge. All right, just-just breathe. No-no-no, shhh... just breathe in and out. Oh, fuck me. Why didn't they kill us? I think they tried their best. No-no, I mean the door was wide open. Why didn't they come inside? I don't know, maybe they're enjoying themselves. None of this makes any sense. I grew up around Ted and Lisa, they sell CBD dog biscuits, and now they're hacking people up with machetes, because some black guy got into a bar fight? Maybe you don't know them as well as you think you do. Or maybe something weird is going on, like I told you, the whole town is acting bizarre. Maybe they're not in control. Bullshit. What are you doing? I'm not gonna stay here and listen to you give excuses for your racist white supremacist friends. I'm serious; we need to figure out what's happening. We have to get the fuck out of here. Now, Jack's coming back with the car. But first, I have to find my dad's safe. Why? Who the fuck cares? I do. I need it. Are you serious? Ben? You dropped your phone. All this over a bar fight? Amy, right? Yeah, oh, that's cute. Mason. I remember you, always sitting in the corner of the bar with a fork, alone. I don't know how you ended up here, I don't care. Just stop helping him, go home. Mason, this is fucked. Amy, I promise you haven't seen anything yet. Now, are you staying or are you leaving? You don't even know him. Your call. You can't come inside, can you? What's really happening here? Why are you doing this? It's me now or half the town later, they're gonna figure out where you are. Come outside, get past me, you can make your escape. I like disappointing you, Mason. We're gonna finish what we started. You're right, there's something else going on here. Turn off the lights. They already know we're here. We don't want them knowing where. We could block out the bedroom. I found some ibuprofen in the bathroom. I'm sorry, it's not gonna do much. Thanks, I'm fine, I just -- I need to keep moving. You should still take it. Uh, I'm an addict, doesn't matter if it's sugar pills, I can't take them. I'll, um -- uh, at least have some water. Here. Thanks. Okay, I got to find that safe before Jack gets back. No-no, hold on, hold on. We have to figure out what the fuck's going on. Uh-huh, you already figured out that they can't come in, that's good enough for now. Now, you're gonna help me or you can stay here. No, uh, what, uh -- what about your friend, we can't warn him. Mason has your phone, I don't have one. What's Mason gonna do when the -- your friend comes rolling in? Oh fuck. Okay, all right, all right, all right, just-just -- all right, just listen, just calm down, okay? All right, we just have to figure out what's happening, okay. I didn't tell you everything about me and your dad. Go on. I, uh, wasn't just keeping your dad's spare keys for him. He told me that if anything weird happened in town that I was supposed to come here and hide. He said it would be safe. What? Yeah. I mean, yeah, I thought he was a bit eccentric, but I think -- I think now, I think he knew something like this was going to happen. How? I don't know, but the research he was doing at the library, it was some really creepy stuff. Now what kinda stuff? Well, he would read -- reading these old books and in these languages I didn't understand, but there were diagrams and there were images, and they looked evil, demonic. Come on, Amy. I'm not messing around, I swear. But what does this have to do with anything? I just -- I mean, uh -- you have to admit the whole not being able to come inside thing is pretty strange. Sure, we can call that strange. Yeah, and-and like I said, everything was acting weird in town before you even got here. Yeah, and you wanna blame that on demons? No -- I don't know, maybe. You gotta be kidding me, come on. Look, I just wanna know what's going on. Why aren't Ted and Lisa breaking through the windows right now? They're racist white people, they do crazy shit. And they're just probably fucking with us. I just think that if we could find some of your dad's research it could give us a clue as to what's going on. Demon research. Uh -- No. Where are you going? To find my father's safe. How can you think about money right now? I promised Jack I'd find it, and I owe him. What is he, your bookie? What kind of friend needs your money this badly? My only friend and he'd dying. What? Cancer. And I don't want him to spend his last days broke, in a rat-infested hospice, because of me. Because of you? What? Just wanna know my whole life story? Fine, got all the time in the world, right? Jack was my boxing trainer and manager ever since I was a kid he'd look out for me, in the ring and out, even when I was being a shitty kid thinking I was invincible. For a time I kinda was, I was winning fights, then I started partying hard. Jack wanted me to stop, but I didn't listen. I got out of control, ended up hurting this guy before the actual fight at the fucking weigh-ins. Boxing commission came down hard, revoked my license. Now, both me and Jack are broke, and he's got cancer. So Arthur's money is the only way I know how to make his life a little bit more comfortable. I'm sorry, I didn't know. Something here is fucked. And I don't know what I'm gonna do when Jack gets here, but it's all for nothing if I don't find that money. Come with me. I've been all over the house looking for more of your dad's research, there's no safe here. The only place I haven't gone is the cellar, but the entrance is on the side of the house, you have to go outside. Of course it is. You really think it's there? Maybe. And sometimes when I pick up Arthur he'd be down there. He said it was cooler in the summer. How far exactly? Well, it's, um -- it's from there to around there. Okay. If I go in the dark and keep quiet I think I can get inside without them noticing. Can you run in your condition? Yeah, it's not far, I'll be fine. Listen, we know they can't come in the house, but what about under it, does the cellar count? I don't know, we have to try; give me your knife. For fuck sake, I'm not staying here alone in the dark. And besides, you'll never find the door without me. I appreciate it. On three, I'm gonna turn off the light, you're gonna open the door, we're gonna keep quiet. If I get caught you run back. Fuck, Ben, I don't wanna die. We better make it. One, two, three. Amy, where are you? Be quiet. Where are you? -- Ben, it's not me, come back. Take my hand. Get off me.- Amy, run! - Get off of him! - Amy, run! Ben! Ben! Fuck. Did you see Lisa? Lisa? She was trying to pull you into the trees. Yeah, ...where's the knife? Oh my god, oh my god, I must've dropped it. -Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me. -I'm so sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so fucked. Oh my god. Oh my god, I'm gonna be sick. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. Come on. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. No, sorry, I'm sorry. You just saved me, all right; just -- I-I shouldn't have made us do that. Um, it's -- I told you something fucked was going on. Look, we're gonna figure it out. We're gonna find that fucking safe, and we get the fuck outta here. I'll be okay, just give me a second. Oh my god. What is that? Looks like an old church pulpit. Well, as one of the only Jews in town, I'm gonna take your word on that. Yeah, it's a church pulpit, Second Coming Baptist Church, 1965. Oh, look at this. What is it? It's some of your dad's research, old photocopies. "Reverend Peter Rakes and son Arthur outside of Kingsport's first integrated church, Second Coming Baptist, Ben, I think this is your father and grandpa there. Let me see that. Tragedy in Kingsport. Authorities are investigating possible arson after Second Coming Baptist Church burned, Wednesday evening. Reverend Peter Rakes is believed to have perished in the blaze. Arson? Your father must have brought your grandfather's old pulpit down here. It's probably all that was left after the fire. What the fuck? What? Look at the date of the newspaper. Friday, October 3rd, 1969. Yeah, but the actual fire, it says, was on Wednesday, the 1st. Yeah. It's the same as the code for the safe. Oh my god, October 1st. Yeah. What does it mean? I don't know. What else is there? Um, an old police report. About the fire? I don't think -- uh, no, it's dated a few days before. It's so faded, I can't read it. Let me try. Oh! Oh! Put it out. Move. Ahh! Oh god. No! I am gonna eat your flesh. Ahh!! It's me, -it's me. You're good. Hey, we're good. Well, I guess I found your fucking safe, huh. Holy shit. This had better be worth it. Did that motherfucker say he wanted to eat me? Cannibal cult? Oh, fuck me. Oh. Hey, thank you, couldn't have done this without you. No kidding. Arthur, what the fuck were you up to. Uh, let me see the police report. Can you read it? If you put the light up here maybe. Okay. Okay, I see my grandfather's name and -- no way. What? The home address is the same as the church. So? Read it. It was here. Yeah, I my dad didn't bring the pulpit downstairs. It was always there. Your dad built the house where your grandfather's church burned down. Yeah, my dad retired and moved home, literally. But why? Not for the happy memories. For protection. From what? If the house is on the same land as the church then it's on consecrated grounds. Holy shit. Exactly. That's why cannibal cult can't come inside. Maybe you're right. Something demonic is going on. And maybe my dad knew it. Uh, maybe. You've got all your dad's research. You've got cannibal guy, down in the cellar, puking blood when it comes inside, and now this. What more evidence do you need? Yeah, but why is this happening? What's the point? I don't know. And why is your dad's safe combo the same as the date of the fire? Fuck. If there's no money in there this is all for nothing. Okay, well, calm down, let's just open it. Oh, this keeps getting better. Hello? Hello, Ben Rakes, you there? Hey, your friend Jack sent me. Ben? Hey, my name is Jay Amir; I'm a nurse at Kingsport General. Your friend Jack told me what happened, said I should come look at your hand. Where's Jack? Ben? Where is Jack? He was involved in a fight, he's being held in emergency. Ben, what are we doing here, man? Hold on. Seriously? No. There we go. Don't drop that one. Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah, what the fuck? What are you doing? Uh, sorry, we're just, um -- We were attacked. Christ, everyone in this town has gone nuts. No-no, I'm out. Oh -- Wait, hey, is Jack all right? Ask him yourself, he's at the hospital. Oh please-please, we need help, please. Let me see. Show me the damage. Check her first. I can see you both, and right now you need medical attention. It's okay, Ben, I'm a big girl. Jesus, I thought it was just your hand. It was till the local lynch mob got me. Okay. If I take that wrap off the bleeding is gonna get worse. Here, best I can do right now is antibiotics. No pills, I'm a recovering addict. No, it's penicillin, not painkillers. I can't do it, man. You know I'm here to help you, right. He said no; he needs a hospital, we both do. Yeah, you're right. And Jack said that the sheriff is helping people look for me. I don't think that's safe. There's a -- there's a hospital in Elliot Lake. Could-could you drive us there? Okay. Get in the back, stay low. Let's go. Come on. Uh, wait, I forgot this safe box, I'll be right back. Uh-uh, no, there's no time. Just give me a second. No, look -- okay, you should not be walking around, just get in the car, Amy will get it. What - what are you two doing? How did you know my name? I-I don't know, Jack told me when we were, uh, when, uh -- uh, you got me. You motherfuckers. Seriously, you? Birds of a feather. Aren't you both clever. Jesus. I told you, I like disappointing you, Mason. Ben, let's go into the house. What the hell is this anyway, some sort of racist cult, with a side of brown? You guys like going out picking fights, trying to kill black folks. Well, it's not going too well this time, is it? You know, it would've been over real quick if you just passed out at the bar. Quiet. Passed out? You don't drink. No, I don't. Did you drug me with something? Yeah, don't feel bad, addict's tolerance. Come out of the house now and no one else gets hurt. You wanna eat us, Mason? The guy in the basement said that just before we bashed his brains out. So, let me ask you, do you wanna get a slice of white bread and eat us? Just you. What's fucking wrong with you? I am sorry you keep bringing other people into this, Ben. I didn't wanna do this. This? What's this? Ben, let's just go. You better come out of the house now, Ben. Oh yeah. What is this? Okay-okay-okay. The fuck. Don't. Ben, just get back in the house, fuck these guys. Like I said, Ben, come out of the house and no one else gets hurt. I'm gonna fucking kill you if you hurt him. Stay back. Fuck. What? Decision time, Ben. She's moving pretty fast. I don't know how long that fishing line is. It's around his neck. Stay back on the porch. Let him go. Come down out of the house and I'll cut the line. He'll kill you both. Jack-Jack, what do I do? Come down and take his place and he lives. Fine, I will. No, son, listen to me, you don't give these fuckers anything. Ben, I'm so sorry about your friend. It's my fault. Okay, we're not gonna go there. He came here to get me. He wouldn't have been here if it wasn't for me. You were trying to help him. No, I wasn't. I was trying to fix my own fuckup. I'm not a good person, Amy. Jack and I didn't lose our boxing careers, because of my drinking, I cheated. I hurt people. What do you mean? When I first started losing the big fights I thought it was because of the partying, all the drinking and drugs slowed me down, right. So, I sobered up, trained harder. But deep down I was afraid I just wasn't as good as I thought I was, and I didn't want that to be true. So, I made a change. Jack would've killed me if he knew, but I got one of my assistant trainers to start loading my gloves. So he put plaster of Paris in the wraps, made my fists like a concrete block; I started winning. And the inevitable happened. What? I started really hurting people. I was winning in devastating fashion. I was breaking jaws, noses, orbital bones; one guy lost his sight. I knew it was wrong, but I was winning again, and Jack was happy, I-I couldn't stop. And you got caught, and Jack took the blame too. Yeah, we both got lifetime bans. And then Jack got cancer, and then he was gonna die broke and-and I just got him killed trying to fix it. Okay, well, you fucked up the fighting thing, you did some bad shit, but you were trying to help him. You didn't get Jack killed, Mason did, blame him. I do. Good, fuck him, and fuck all those people with him. You're right. I'm gonna fucking kill Mason. No, that's not what I meant. Fucking. Fuck. Stop it; this is exactly what he wishes you'll do. Then I'm gonna be his fairy-fucking-godmother. Fuck this. Okay-okay, you go out there and you die or you get eaten or whatever, something really bad is gonna happen. What are you talking about? Ben, I don't think that you're just some random black guy they found in a bar. Look, September, 1969, your grandfather reports something to the police, okay? October 1st, 1969, he dies when somebody burns down his church. Yeah, we know that. Okay, so your dad's doing all of this creepy -- your dad's doing all of this creepy research, and then he dies suddenly in a car crash. But, Ben, your father barely drove anymore, I had to take him to and from the library. So, it's like he saw something, got spooked, and died trying to run. Like he knew he was in danger. Exactly. So, he left you combo to the safe, the same date as the fire. He needed you to know something. But the will says there was money. Well, I mean, you said so yourself, Ben, that you weren't exactly the greatest guy in the past, and you hadn't kept in touch. So, maybe he thought this was the only way to get you here, to warn you. Fair. Time to open that safe. Let's do this. Be careful. What is it? Uh, it looks like a-a recorder. Oh, and there's a -- it's a cassette. It's the same date as the police report. Put it in, let's play it. It's broken. Looks like it. This is Reverend Peter Rakes. The date is September 29th, 1969. What follows is a recording of the exorcism of Mason Banks, age 36. Present with me are Mason and his mother, Ethel Banks. Please, hurry. Untie me. Mason, your mother and I are trying to help you. An exorcism? You're not Catholic priest. I am god's servant. A lonely Baptist in a crumbling church. Let me look closer at you. Uh, how is he doing that? Don't look at it, read with me. Be strong in the lord, for we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the cosmic powers over the present darkness. Stop, wait. Why have been yourself to me. He spit and step on your Nazarenes cross, he called out to me. You lie. He wanted the power to hurt you. He hates you. What? Why? You're no church integration, Negroes praying with whites, the boys will ensure the power to destroy you. I did you a favor by taking him. Our father in heaven, hallowed be thy name -- get off her. Keep fighting My teeth are dull, but strong. You killed her -- reverend, this boy will eat your living flesh. That will not happen. If not you, then your son or his son, this is my promise, I curse. I shall reward the boy with unimaginable power once he has tasted your family's living flesh. Stay back, in the name Jesus Christ. See you soon, reverend. Mason, wait-wait. Fuck. Fuck. Ben-Ben, can you hear me? Come on out. I'll cook you in there like we did with your granddaddy. You motherfucker. What do we do now, Ben? Shit, here we go. So, you staying in or you coming out, Ben? If you come out I'll spare the girl. Go fuck yourself, you fucking fuck. Amy? What? Quiet. What? You'll let the girl go? I'll think about it. Now you can't be serious? I'm not. I have a plan. I'm not gonna fight. We're not. Jay's car is still here, I've got the keys. I'll go out there and distract them while you make a run for the car. Fuck that, I'm not leaving you alone. Well, then what, Amy, what are you gonna do? You're gonna stay here and die in a fire, screaming like my grandfather while those fuckers watch. If you go outside and get eaten alive something fucked is gonna happen, Mason is gonna have, fucking, godlike powers; you really want that? At least you might get out of here. Stop it. I know you wanna be a good guy, Ben, but this isn't how you do it. No. Wait, you're wrong. What? I'm not a good guy. We've been doing this all wrong, acting exactly the way Mason wants, like my father and my grandfather, being scared, trying to escape, asking why is this happening. Right. Well, who the fuck cares why it's happening. Mason wants us out there so he could eat us. Well, fuck him, let's not do that. Let's handle this like cheating fucks. How do we do that? Change the rules. They wanna eat us; well, they have to come in here to do it, on our turf. And we'll be ready. I mean, it's an idea, but, I mean, isn't it holy ground, they can't come inside. Then we'll make it unholy. You ready? No, but whatever. You think we can do this? No. Fuck. Look, the keys are in my gym bag if they get me first. No, that better not fucking happen. You know you swear a lot for a librarian, right? My career is not a personality trait. Yeah, okay. Here we go. What's up, Mason? Are you coming out, Ben? I got a question for you. We just listened to a exorcism podcast, heard you talking about eating my family, and that demons would bless you for it. Well, I can't help, but notice that there hasn't been much eating. My grandfather died in a house fire, and my father died in a car crash, so this cannibalism or insurance fraud? Does the rest of your little cult know what a loser you are, huh? You must really wanna eat me, Mason. I'm the last Rakes, your only chance. Last chance to come out. That won't help you. Oops. I desecrate this land, I spit and step on the cross, revoking it as god's house. They did it. Amy? Fuck. Amy! You honestly thought you could avoid this? Where are you going? You thought you could beat me. When I raise my hand I can feel the stars. I can dip my foot down into hell and feel the damned kiss my feet. Imagine what I'll be capable of once I consume you, I will be a god. It's all right, I was never gonna let her go. Do you know how long I have waited to taste your flesh? To hear you scream, to be granted my power. You gonna keep talking about it or you gonna do it? You feel good, Mason, godlike? What have you done? Bad things. See, you're so used to hurting good people you weren't ready for a bad motherfucker. Where is Ben Rakes? Spending 30 days in rehab, I'm his AA sponsor. When his dad died he fell off the wagon, so I took him to AA. On the way, he kept babbling about his dad's will and money in his safe. I was the wrong guy to tell. So, I broke into his place, stole the will, and here I am. I told you, Mason, I like disappointing you. Yeah Let's go. Fuck. Okay. Okay. So, what is your name anyway?
