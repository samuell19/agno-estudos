(Music) Mr. Teacher, allow... No, I do not allow it. Stubborn, sit down, defiant. Why more defiant? You have to fool me, Doctor. Please, I'll come up to you. - Stay here. - Let me through. Miss Bundschuh, manuscript please. Look, the thing is. The teacher challenged the student and the tension between these two is going to be dramatic. Do you understand that? So, the student sits defiant, stupid. So please, Doctor, please show me. Yes, if you allow. Of course I allow. So that's how. Pfeiffer. How far are you with your detention? Pretty ready. With you, that takes a bad turn, Pfeiffer. What should become of you? I'm at a loss, sit down. You see, that's how you sit in my opinion, if you have a rage on the teacher. Dear Doctor, that was unnatural, You have no idea. Well, you also said that you never in life were at a school. Schiller has never led an army and yet a "Wallenstein" written, no. But Schiller, to continue the example, studying the milieu. You have been taught by a tutor. While I was at school. Maybe longer than necessary. Please, I will not do that. I was a model student. Even, just. I can not imagine that you can play a secondary from the town. Why not? Your milk, doctor. Let me with your milk. (Music) Be quiet with the music. Out. Calm. I will not let you chop my piece. Mr BÃ¼rglein, I do not want music. I also do not wish for apotheosis at the end. Marion, you really look unbelievable. You can not play the fish from the small town. Back fish in the small town are still reading fairy tales. Hard to believe, that Erich Pfeiffer has such a famous brother in Berlin. I would like to get to know him. At 20, already a real poet. Yes, and at age 20, his brother Erich had failed 3 times. Erich is very different. Tell me, are you really doing so much out of Erich Pfeiffer? He is terribly unintelligent and terribly untalented. But he does gymnastics like a god. Pfeiffer, I have informed your guardian. I have to call attention, Professor, I have been of legal age for one year. The domain administrator Hitz came immediately and inquired about you. That can cost you dearly. What do you allow me, I forbid me your mumbo jumbo. The Hitz manages the assets of my brother and me. If he should keep me short, I would have to sue you unfortunately. Because of financial damage. If I may give you some advice, it's a pity about the money. Your brother is not good for studying. Now he is already 2 years in the Oberprima. Take a seat, sir. Yes, thank you. That has no value. He has to take a practical job. It was the wish of my parents for something to be right. Well, doctor, I am also something right and have not studied. Now everyone. (Music: "Prince Eugene, the noble knight") Prince Eugenius, the noble knight, Want to get the Emperor again city and fortress Belgerad. He had a bridge hit that you can not jerk over probably with the army for the city. He had a bridge hit that you can not jerk over with the army... Stop. Pfeiffer. Sing this once alone. Prinz Eugen. Prinz Eugen. Too deep, Pfeiffer. Prinz Eugen. More in the middle, Pfeiffer. I can not stand in the middle, I can only stand up. Pfeiffer, you are totally unmusical. What do you want to become? Oh, I... Singer. What should become of Erich? I have always had trouble with him. You know, Doctor, I've seen few people, that were so similar externally and so different inside. Best of all, you take him down from school. What else is he supposed to do in high school? He has to take a job. Talk to the rector. Take a look. I? Now? My dear, in a few days I have world premiere. No, that's nonsense. But, listen, it's a great idea. I drive in a small town, after Mittelsbach, and look at a school from the inside. What did you say? Huh? What did you say? You said Eva Knauer will not be my dancing classmate. Quiet. Quiet. What kind of indiscipline is that? How do you stand there? Moment. Danger. Attention. Arms bent. Arms stretched. Arms bent. Arms stretched. Knee bent. Knees stretched. Knee bent. Knees stretched. Hips tight. Fine. Well, you see, the thing looks quite different now. Why are you laughing? I just had to think of a joke by accident. So? I will prove that it is not a joke. Tell. Um, once there was a man. He had 3 sons. The first one was stupid. And further? The second, who was... medium. Next, on, and the third? The third... The third, pooh. I would like to talk to you personally about it. - Quiet. That's not a joke. Nah, I think he's not good. Put! Goodbye, Mr. Administrator. Goodbye. - Your milk, doctor. - Thank you. Apple? For the hot nurse. Do you want something? No thanks. Did you cash the check? Not yet. Novella written off? The novella is ready. I cried. Cried? What did you write off? You misfortune. How do you get to the "woman without a veil"? Take it out. The "Fidelen Balduin" you should write off. Dear Madam Rector, I am certainly not pushing in foreign family matters. Dear Professor, as far as I am concerned, I would like to count you to our family. But Eva is still a child. Certainly, certainly. But the growing virgin must be protected from harmful influences. Rumor has it that that Erich Pfeiffer approaches Eva in the dance class. Always this Pfeiffer. (Music) love, love. And right foot goes around and left goes around to whisper in the dark. And right foot and around and left foot and around. And hop and hop and hop. And right foot and around and left foot and around. And hop and hop and hop. Thank you very much, gentlemen. Please practice at home diligently. And next time the first time with ladies. Please embarrass me and not, my ass. I have to tell you. The ladies are far ahead of you in every respect. Good day. Eva, I have to speak to you. Not so noticeable. What do the others care about me? I have something important to tell you. - What important? - Yes. Just do not do stupid things again. Tomorrow the whole city will speak of me. You have said that many times. May I pour you another glass? Very connected. Where did we interrupt? By Erich Pfeiffer. Right, quite right. Your daughter, dear Rector, is not the first best. And you are the father after all. Yes certainly. I suspect nobody. A bad student does not have to be a bad person. But this Erich Pfeiffer is not on morally sound feet. Do not you want to at least tell me what are you planning to do? No, not yet, but you will be satisfied with me. You will be proud of me. You do not need to make an effort. (Music) Because of structural alteration, the gymnasium remains closed. (everyone is talking) There you go. So what's going on? The school is closed. Not possible. The left wing of the gymnasium should have collapsed. And the right one too. The whole school. Everything is a pile of rubble. Really completely collapsed? Yes, the church too. I eat brooms when you have not. Good Appetite. If that just does not break your neck. Tell me, is this Sunday? No, Thursday. So what's going on? Why is nobody coming? I am also a mystery. That must have been Pfeiffer. Naturally. No one told us about it yesterday. Maybe it's right. It's almost like a roof over your head. So in my ceiling are long cracks. With me, the lime is slowly falling down. What. That's a mumbo jumble. I bet my head that Pfeiffer is behind it again. Should I just go through it? Talk to your brother in Berlin. You never pass the exam. Why do not you leave? Have you heard, gentlemen, the school should have collapsed. Do not believe such fairy tales. Do you know something more? From where? I'll ask Frau Schmerschneider. She told me, she'll know. Eva wants me to stand by my deed. Going through is an even greater act, flee, fly. The font is misplaced. I know the font. No one else did that than Pfeiffer. Pfeiffer, Pfeiffer. We used to do stupid pranks when we were young. It just annoys me that the Pfeiffer does not admit that. He lies, he does not stand by his deeds. Misdeeds. He is a non-expert. A muscleman. We also have to have good gymnasts. Quiet. Quiet. Students of the Royal Real Gymnasium is hereby announced by public request, that today's failed lessons are based on a mistake. And at 10 o'clock begins. Any rumor about dilapidation of the Royal Real Gymnasium is thereby countered. And the top is broken off. If you continue anyway, you are liable to prosecution. (Voices) Departure, the train to Berlin 9:50 clock, high time to board. Heavy traffic today. The D-train from Berlin is also late. Here he comes. Mittelsbach, change to Halle, Leipzig, Dresden. Such an impudence, he probably wants to mislead me, the Pfeiffer. Coward. Excuse me, ma'am, can you tell me. How can I get to the grammar school? You impertinent fellow, you. Well, Pfeiffer, you have courage. How so? Nothing can happen to me. How do you want to dodge this time, that is beyond me. You still dare to the rector? Pfeiffer. Well, that's the height. I know that you are called Pfeiffer. I already hear Pfeiffer all morning. The whole school year I hear Pfeiffer, Pfeiffer. I'm sorry, but you can not help his family name. So, as I said, Pfeiffer. Just because you are suddenly wearing a pince-nez, you do not need to constantly imagine. How long have you been wearing this thing? Pfeiffer, I hope that's not a joke again. No, that's because of the eyes. That's another answer. The doctor prescribed the pince-nez to me. All right, I want to believe you. I will try to believe you from now on. That's nice. That's the basis of today's entertainment. You do not sit on the train for nothing. So it is true that you wanted to escape? Where did you actually want to go? Yes, I would like to know that too, Mr Rector. But one thing I want to emphasize I'm not the one you hold me for. I know what I have to say about you. Well, the thing is done, you have changed your mind. I can already see on your Sunday suit, that you come as a repentant sinner. Pfeiffer, not all is lost yet. Oh, that calms me a lot. Improve your performance, keep yourself neat, let the brawls. And you will one day see that another person has become of you. Yes I see that. I realize that already. Well, well, you'll be punished immediately. Before that, however, I will go with you to your Ordinary, you will ask for forgiveness. So you still stand by your deed? Of course, I take the act fully on me. Bravo, is spoken. Come. This equation will come again and again. Please remember this. Well, there we have this clean man. Erich Pfeiffer has made a comprehensive confession. He will immediately take his custody penalty. Before that, he wants to apologize to the whole class. - Does that have to... - Pfeiffer. Well, well, I mean, I have to deal with the whole thing... I am not connected... All right, sorry. As? Professor, let's have mercy before right. I seriously pleaded with the young man's conscience. He looks at things in a way through different glasses. Yes, it seems to me that way. Lead Primary Pfeiffer into the carcass. He has his 5 h immediately. Called 3 times and get no answer. Marion, you must know where he is. Leave your allusions. For your sake I met yesterday with Dr. Pfeiffer fails. I have to have him. Once it will not work without Dr. Pfeiffer. You're welcome. Please, after you. No, here you have the precedence. Thank you very much. Say, 5 h? - Do you smoke? - Passionate. Please serve your self. Thank you very much. In the carcass must not be smoked. Confiscated until release. Give me back the cigarettes. As? Pfeiffer, no stories. Listen, can I tell you something? Between us? I want to entrust something to you. I'm completely innocently imprisoned here. Everybody says that. Use, please. Do you still love me, Annemarie? Do you still love me, Annemarie? What time is it? I forbid such tastelessness. I was in such a nice mood. 4 o'clock through. A chicane, I have not eaten yet. How long should we try? You are probably so restless because Dr. Pfeiffer does not let himself be seen. For the last time: Take care of your own affairs. Children, do me a favor, do not do theater, keep playing. Do you love me, Annemarie? I love you about everything in the world, I'm going to death with you. You have to go to him and tell him something nice. - Why then? - He did it for you. For me? No. But. Go, he's sure to be happy. No, I will not go. Oh come. I would do that. So go on. - Erich? - As? Erich. - Who's there? - It's me, Eva. Please step back a bit. Come closer again. What's new? I just wanted to tell you, Erich, I think it's wonderful of you. What is wonderful about that? Well, I never thought that you would have the courage to do so. Where can we talk tonight? At 6 o'clock in the world panorama. (Steps) Are you still there? Are you still there? - The main thing is that you are still there. (Ring) Well, there you are finally. Yes, what do you look like? You play the piece on the street, huh? Where are you actually? I got so excited that you did not come. They'll ruin your piece. Now tell me something. Yes, what do you actually have? And where is your pince-nez? Huh? The director raged that you were not there. But now you are really silly. Now why not talk? I was naughty yesterday. Added. Now laugh again. Well, go. Was not I kissing? Oh Hans, how you do it. Really like between the secondary and the prime. Your own piece still makes you childish. Come on. Greetings to Mrs. Windscheidt. To whom? Well, to your landlady. Oh yes. Oh, please, what was the name? Mrs. Windscheidt? Oh, make that come out. Out. Yes, yes, Mr. Pfeiffer, that's how we'll see each other again. I've always told you, do not push it too far. I have had many tenants, but no one has ever sat in the carcass. And you've also gotten a pinch? Another joke? Mr. Pfeiffer. There is nothing you can do. Have you eaten nothing? No, I'm very hungry. That's what I thought. There you go only in your room, I have something good for you. What do you want in the kitchen? Go to your room. The pince-nez is still a bit strange. What do you want in my bedroom? Excuse me very much. I sat in the carcass for a long time, it was a bit dark there. So, Mr. Pfeiffer, now let the coffee taste good. I also had him warm. Yes, and the hood on it. No, thank you, I do not want milk. Black. Why then? Since when? You want to go, can not hold anything? Goodbye. No, no, I just want to get supper. (Telephone ringing) Sorry? Pfeiffer. A long-distance call. - Yes. - There. 18 registered letters please. (Music) N'Abend, Miss Knauer. Please here, new program. (Music) Huh? What's going on with Eva? Oh, that's a little girl. Do I love you? Very funny. Oh, from where. Say, Erich, who is the father of Eve? Who? The principal? Uh-huh. Tell me, what did I eat? Wait, I have to write. Do you also write, yes? Yes. Sign? Aha. What was written on the sign? As? Lice Jung. Are you scared now? No, no, calm down. I've been in jail for you already. Yes. 5 h. Uh-huh. And then listen, Hans, take you v.a. in front of Crey. Yes, yes, he does not like us. Uh-huh. Wat is? As? Cap? Ha, cap, yes I have. Just bought, oh... You, I have to stop, it will come back. So, good luck. So, darling, here I am again. Look, I have everything your heart desires. Apples, nuts, ground turnip, white cheese. What to eat... What are you eating? Cold cuts. Cold cuts look very nice. You as a die-hard vegetarian. N'Abend, Mr. Pfeiffer. Is it very full inside? The gentlemen are completely alone. How so? Miss Knauer is already here. A student card. (Music) Good evening. Has anyone seen you? No nobody. Me neither. (Music) I am very glad that you came. They were really gorgeous. Not worth talking about. I was afraid that they would throw you out. Nice from you. Eva... Eve, I... I know, Professor Crey bullies you only for my sake. Yes. This Crey is a dreadful guy. (Music) You did not take offense what I just said. Maybe. I find secrecy very nice. So, you find. - You not? - No. I have to go home now, please do not join me. A dog weather. We probably can not go out anymore. Or? Impossible, I have to work. Pours too much. What do you want to work for? I have to... um, seal. Darling, you can do the scene tomorrow morning too. No, that's impossible. I have to do the scene tonight... Tonight I have to have her, I still have to have her. Then I'll keep you company. No, no, do it for me no unpleasant inconveniences. You're weird. Otherwise you always say that you work best, if I am with you. Yes, of course, I say otherwise too. In dog weather, I can not possibly expect you to stay here. (clears throat) (clears throat) (clears throat) (Murmurs) (clears throat) (clears throat) I also cooked your favorite dish for you: Pork ribs with sauerkraut. N / A? - Does not look fine? - Yes. So good appetite, Mr. Pfeiffer. (clears throat) Erich, Erich. - Well, do you have her? - Whom? The scene? You should not interrupt me. Now you have ripped me completely out of the poetic mood. I almost had her. I did not say anything. If you make me a scene, I can not do the scene. So should I go? Yes, I will accompany you, er. God, how lovely of you. Do not you want to take another umbrella with you? Are you funny today? Now stop the nonsense. But, Marion, I'll take you home. Just cock up your umbrella. Yes. 1640-88, the great Elector. 1648, he acquires Pomerania. 1657, the sovereign possession of Prussia. 1675, he beats the Swedes at Fehrbellin. 1640-88, the great Elector. 1648, he acquires Pomerania. 1656, no... 1657, the sovereign possession of Prussia. 1675, he beats the Swedes at Fehrbellin. (Murmurs) Of course, again the Pfeiffer. On. Where do you have your hand, Pfeiffer? What kind of attitude is that, Pfeiffer? You probably want to make fun of me, Pfeiffer. We are not in the gym class here. Pfeiffer? Come here. What did we have last time, my dear Pfeiffer? 8 to 9: Latin. Beware of Crey. What does that mean? I wanted to prepare myself especially for the lesson. Very beautiful. Eva? What do you allow yourself, you impossible man? (Ring) Morning darling, nice that you're done, - We have to go right away. - Why? Do not you know what's going on at 10 o'clock? Today is Friday, from 10 to 11 math. Now stop your foolishness. We have to rehearse. No, no, I will not do it. It is impossible. I did not sleep the whole night. The scene is not finished yet. Then at least we meet for dinner in the "grape", yes? And at 5 o'clock we go to the "Kaiserhof". - U, a, w, g. - U, a, w, g? And in the evening there is dancing. Cheek darling. And in the evening there is dancing. 80 pfennigs. (Ring) Good morning, Doctor. (Ring) - Tomorrow, Doctor. - Tomorrow. - You recognize me, Doctor? - Yes. May I then enter? Please, come in. I think you really do not remember me. How so? We were together the other night. Ah yes, there we were. And you have given me your book: The transformations of Venus. Sun. We wanted to talk about it. Ah, did we want that? Yes, we can do that. Come closer, please. You know, Doctor, I find your escape most beautiful. My escape? Yes, Elisabeth's escape, of course. Well, of course, Elisabeth's. Yes. May I say what I think? You're welcome. Do you know, was Elisabeth Rudolf's lover or was she not? Yes, I never realized that myself. But you really ought to know. We want to be discreet in these things. Doctor, the masseuse is waiting in the bedroom. - What? Who? - The masseuse. Oh, right. Then I am disturbing. At the moment unfortunately yes. Doctor has to test later. Yes, sorry, please excuse me. Read it through the book, then you will already have different things. I have to go to the masseuse. Where is the masseuse? But there is none, Doctor. - That was our cue. - Oh. Your milk, doctor. Does it have to be that way? 100, 200... 300, 400. What is this money? From the check of the publishing house. Ah, from the check, yes, from the publishing house. Hm. Doctor, I want to ask you something. Sorry? Can I maybe go home from rehearsal earlier today? Why then? My mother has the little shop. Tomorrow begins the sale, there is always a lot to do, to reckon. We give you 10% discount. How much? - 10%. But that's enough. Yes, of course you can go, Miss... Ilse. Sit down, Miss Ilse. Listen to: If you have written so n piece, you know after some time not at all, what you wrote so. Tell me my piece, as if I had not written it. But, Doctor, I can not do that. Why not? You are a secretary. Yes, yes, but... So start shooting. No. Um. Annemarie, the daughter of the director, is swarmed by a primate. - She is weak. - How so? - At school. - Oh, yes. And the Primaner always helps her with the work. But she loves the actor of a visiting troupe. Not bad. Please continue. Annemarie's father wants to curse her. You are not my daughter anymore. It's me, father. I love Benvenuto. You are too young, Annemarie, you are too precocious. This "schmatzatz" has twisted your head. By the way, his name is not Benvenuto. His name is Julius Schimmelbeck. (shouts) That's not true. Well, well, do not scream like that, Marion. But what, I've talked it over with Mr. Pfeiffer. (shouts) That's not true. Aha, there you are. Come here. At last the doctor is here, where have you been for so long? Good morning, doctor. Good morning, Dr. Pfeiffer. So Hans, now listen, should I cry out at this point or no? At which point? The scene with the father. Oh, that. Why should not you scream? Look, little lord, I should. But then on your responsibility, Doctor. I think the thing with the name Schimmelbeck dared at all. How do you come to this, sir? As a director, I have my own opinion. Ah, you are the director. Now finally leave those silly jokes. How so? I did not say anything. I think if you scream, let them scream too. Just yell both of you. What I wanted to ask on this occasion, Doctor, How do you now think about my final pharmacy? With music and dance. Oh, just like you. Are you serious? Mhm, full of seriousness. So with Apotheosis? Yes, calm with the... pants. With music and dancing at the end, I ask you here among witnesses. Music and dance at the end. Now suddenly? Of course, now suddenly. Let's finish the little song afterwards: Left foot and around and right foot and around. Love, love. Do you know it? We take. Doctor, you have changed so much. Well, that will come as it comes straight. So let's go back the bit. Get started. You are not my daughter anymore. It's me, father, it's me. - Miss Ilse? - Yes? The income of your mother so in the store a month? They make fun of me. No, not at all, I am very interested in the shop. For the store? So, I mean for the trimmings. Maybe later for a scene like that. If you were right, Miss Ilse, I would take a look at your business tomorrow. Mold Beck. (startled) That's not... If you want to talk, At least make that you come out. You are not my daughter anymore. (Music) Attention, mesdames, care, gentlemen. Please, engage. And... (Music) I am very happy. Careful, watch us. Emil, Professor, I have to speak to you urgently. Something happened? Something terrible. Pfeiffer has pushed the Ackermann aside when engaging. And Eva dances with Pfeiffer. Please, women's election, the ladies hire the gentlemen. (Music) - Your daughter. - Yours not? (Music) It will be noticed when we dance so much together. Oh, it should be noticeable. (Music) We meet tomorrow evening in the "beautiful view". I will give you the opportunity to speak to Eve alone. I will not let this opportunity pass by unused. This Pfeiffer is to get to know me. (Music) There is a little room in my heart. I will not let anyone in, I shut it up. Come in, secret red, with us German Merzlern. This is my favorite red and that is you. You did to me. You are as tough as Perligran and sweet as marzipan. In my little room should not be another. Only you alone. Every hour. You did to me. You are as tough as Perligran and sweet as marzipan. In my little room should not be another. Only you alone. (Music) Since Adam once in Paradise with Mrs. Eva the story began. At night, beware, when it gets dark, love, love. Always 2 are in love with enthusiasm in the dark to murmur. Dear moon, good moon, who lives up in the sky, Please hide your face. Because if 2 are in love, watch, Dear moon, that will not work. (Music) Do not we want to dance, darling? It's your favorite tune. Yes, I do not want to dance right now. I'm more comfortable. - Excuse me? - As? - Excuse me? - You're welcome. Yes. - Upper, Upper. - Yes my Lord. What is it? A bottle of rum, pastries, 14.50 marks. Ah, here you are. Tell the lady when she comes back she should not wait for me. The director, you know, from the theater, The director would have called me by phone. She should not wait for me, could be very late. (Music) - Waiter. - Madam. Where is the Lord? The Lord has been called by telephone from the director. From the director? Yes, so said the Lord. And you do not want to wait for him. It would be very late tonight. It's dance time. Yes. So today the steam engine. What is a steam engine? Since we imagine ourselves quite stupid. First there is the steam boiler. What is a steam boiler? A steam boiler is a large, black room with 2 openings. Through the one opening is fired through the other opening... We'll get that later. Chalk. Then comes the valve. What is a valve? Here we are again stupid. A valve is where only something can but nothing in his life. Or the other way around. The steam acts only from one side on the piston and back. So clean and then back to the other side. Not true? (Beat) Yes, please? What is? Mr Ordinarius would like to come to the Director, please. - Yes. So diligently repeat the valve. (screams) And left foot and around and right foot and around. (all) Love, love. And left foot and around and right foot and around... What are you doing there? We do left foot and around and right foot and around. - Love, Love. - Quiet! What kind of funny movement is that? Show me how. Yes, very difficult, Mr. Ordinarius, may I ask. That's about it. And left foot and around and right foot and around. I can do that much better than you. Left foot and around and right foot and around. (all) Love, love. Love, love. Doctor, I have measured it, are still 25 m. AHA nice. But this scarf with flowers does not really work. Then put it on top of it. Yes. But our silk is great. - Cost? - Uh, 4,60. We bought her for 3.80 marks. But Frau Bundschuh, that's not possible. Give it down, the silk, right? At least we have to reach 5 marks. We do it like that: Let's draw it out with 5.50 marks less 10% discount, what do you think? Then we have at least 5 marks. Then we have a post openwork stockings from last year, I think so nice. But I think they are not modern anymore. How come? That's where we make a specialty out of it. Of course, give me that, give me a look. Let's dictate the fashion, we hang out in the shop window. But, Ilse, the doctor does not care. Mrs. Bundschuh, that interests me very much. Do you have any idea, by the way, are very pretty. That's what I've been for... Well, since I have such a small shop here... I could absolutely imagine. Purchase, sale, everything that I... Would possibly get the thing going. Ilse, do you want to come down for a moment? Do we want to decorate the shop window. - Take the doll away. - Yes. Do not we want to dress the lady again? More in the middle. The desk more in the middle. Springer, touch it. BÃ¼rglein, when is the dr. Pfeiffer left you tonight? Who? Dr. Pfeiffer? I do not know. In the middle more. Yes / Yes. More right, more right. So 6th scene, do you have the 6th scene? - Page 15, yes. - Without Marion. - Say, civic... - You can go home. I want to ask you something else. Do not you have the Dr. Pfeiffer call back after 11 o'clock yesterday evening? I have dr. Call Pfeiffer away? I did not remember. He just made it out with somebody. Doctor plays "At school", right? Use has already told me a lot about it. That will be beautiful. Yes wonderful. Tomorrow at the performance, That must be a very strange feeling for you. Yes, certainly, Mrs. Bundschuh. That's an unpleasant feeling. Do you still have safety pins? Yes of course. - Doctor? - Yes? Should you play your next piece in a white goods store? Yes, it would be nice if the next thing could be here in the store. - Doctor? - Hm? They have become so different. That's the way I am? - To me too. - To you too? I did not want that, I apologize. Did you notice that the professor secretly left with Eva? A strange coincidence. Professor Crey just had to come to the "Beautiful View". Why coincidence? That's natural. Now he explains to her. Nonsense, Eva is still a child. No, Emil, I know that better. Professor Crey is a man in a secure position. (Music) Now I'm starving you up there. Miss Eva, please drop me off. Yes, if you want to promise me one. Yes, please, everything. You have to be kinder to Pfeiffer. I treat Pfeiffer strictly, but fairly. Then just treat him just the next time. All right, but let me down. - If you promise. - Yes, please. (Music) N evening Eve. Good evening Erich. Professor Crey went on strangely. He has every reason to do so. - So? - Yes. - Did Crey talk about me? - No. What did you talk about? From you. I think we are in the last time a little bit apart. I can not find it. - No? - No. Do not you want to finally say you to me? Eva, huh? Do not you want to say a sentence with me to you? You could not have found a better sentence with you. (Music) Young lady. Young lady. What is it? When will the connection with Berlin finally come? The doctor is not there yet, wait and see. (Telephone ringing) Telephone connection Pfeiffer, Berlin. Oh, here? From Mittelsbach? Yes, please. Hello? Miss Bundschuh, is it you? Miss, the communication is very bad with Berlin. - Hello? - Hans? Where are you? In Mittelbach? - With who? - Good gracious. 2.80 marks makes the conversation. Hello? Is there anyone else there? Young lady. Yes, here telephone connection Pfeiffer, Berlin. Mounted? That's a joke. Not you, miss. And you want to be my daughter. I find the Ackermann hideous. A model student, a mother's son. Eve, if this Pfeiffer becomes your partner, you can experience something. I always like to experience something. In that tone I should have spoken to my mother. I would have got beating. I only dance with the Pfeiffer. (Music) Is a Herr Doktor Pfeiffer in the hotel? - Yes. - His room number, please. Mr. Pfeiffer does not live in the hotel, he lives privately. It just keeps getting better. (Music) Then please give me a room. But I only need it for 2 hours, I'm in transit. Marion Eisenhut, actress, Berlin. Yes, gracious miss. Please, room 1 on the 1st floor. You said the gentleman is in the house? - Yes, in harmony. - With whom? The club has every 1st Saturday of the month a meeting in our house. Completely crazy. Who is the little one with whom Doctor Pfeiffer dances? Miss Eva Knauer, the daughter of the rector Knauer of the Royal Real Gymnasium. The gentlemen belong to the dignitaries of the city. People probably have a lot of money, right? Yes, Mrs. Eva Knauer will later inherit much from her Mr. Papa. Such a dowry hunter. Tell Dr. Pfeiffer I have to speak to him immediately in my room. I'll tell the doctor right away. Yes, but immediately. Thank you very much. Well, Pfeiffer. Terpsichore is also closer to you than Pallas Athena. I'm in no closer relationship with both ladies. A lady wants to talk to you immediately on room 1. - Me? - Yes, an actress. She has just arrived from Berlin. The gentlemen apologize for a moment. Franz, who wishes to talk to Pfeiffer? A fine actress. She seems to know Mr. Pfeiffer well. I can no longer surprise with this Pfeiffer. A young lady? Young, very elegant, wonderful perfume. This discarded little guy is your dance class partner. You had to have that. - Hans, are you crazy? - How so? What in the world are you doing in this nest? In the ballroom, you run away from me, for 2 days I'm looking for you everywhere. Your piece will let you down. And who is this little sheep you jumped around with? - My bride. - As? Erich's abandoned bride had to accept her. - Who is Erich? - My brother. Hansi, I do not believe you of the nonsense. Believe what you want, but if you make me a scandal here, we are divorced people. Are you going or not? Yes, of course. Go to the train, I'll come. No, I'm waiting here. That's impossible. You do not know the little townsfolk, I have to say goodbye. Then at least take me out. Does it have to be that way? Coward. How you mean. - Erich. - Hans. Erich. Goodbye, Hans. But fast. What does that mean? Hans, Erich, Hans Erich. Who are you? The right to the question you ask has only Knauer family. May I ask? Such a lout. I ask to take a seat. Mrs. Rector. Erich, what does all this mean? Here is my passport, Mr. Rector. Here's my income tax assessment. That will interest you, right? Now allow me to introduce myself. I wanted to do it back then in the principal's room, but you did not let me speak. My name is Pfeiffer. Venus? Yes, Eva, that's me. - What can I say? - Yes and Amen. Or should I officially stop for the hand of your daughter? What's up with the actress? The actress plays the lead role in today's world premiere in Berlin. You are not my daughter anymore. It's me, father. I love Benvenuto. You are too young, Annemarie. You are too precocious. The Schmierenfatzke has twisted your head. He is not called Benvenuto, but Julius Schimmelbeck. That is not true. No, never again do I have such a theater. I do not understand why you are so restless. - It's all great. - Until now. I know that everything will work out. - Say v. A. Not Hans to me. - Why? - I am my brother. - What? I'll explain that to you later. Tell me, Ilse, whatever happens, do you think to me? - Yes. - Do you? - Fast, to Berlin. - Where? - To Berlin. - To Berlin? My horses have never been there. Well. Forget it. And forgive. And Benvenuto is my son-in-law. (Music) Copyright WDR 2014
