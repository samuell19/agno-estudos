HOW'S YOUR SHOULDER? WINDY UP THERE. YEAH. YOU CAME TOO DAMN CLOSE BEFORE YOU OPENED YOUR CHUTE! THEY CAME FOR A SHOW. LISTEN TO 'EM, KID. THEY'LL SETTLE FOR A LOT LESS THAN YOU'RE GIVING 'EM. YOU NEVER CAN TELL WHAT THEY'LL SETTLE FOR UNTIL YOU'VE TRIED IT. HEY! FEW ROOT BEERS. I REALIZE IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE TOO MUCH NOW, MIKE, BUT, UH, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A HELL OF A CROWD. WE WILL. GET PEOPLE COMING INTO THIS TOWN ON A WEEKEND FROM 25 MILES AROUND. I CHECKED ALL THAT OUT. YOU AND THE FELLAS ARE, UH, PUTTIN' UP THE STANDS FOR HER? THAT'S RIGHT. MM-HMM. HARRY TOLD ME YOU WAS COMIN'. WHO'S HARRY? FELLA PUTTIN' UP THE STANDS. NEVER SEEN NOTHIN' LIKE THAT AROUND HERE BEFORE. NO, SIR. IT'S GONNA BE SOMETHIN'. BROWDY? YEAH? WHAT ABOUT THE HIGHWAY? WHAT ABOUT IT? IT'S TOO CLOSE TO THE FIELD. WHO'S GONNA PAY 2.50 FOR A TICKET WHEN THEY CAN PARK ALONG THE HIGHWAY AND WATCH IT FOR NOTHING? ANYBODY PULL A CHEAP TRICK LIKE THAT, I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT. WHAT DO I OWE YA? 45 CENTS. YOU REALLY CHARGING $2.50, SON? YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT WE ARE, AND IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY OF IT. MM-HMM. STILL, NO, SEEMS TO ME THE YOUNG FELLOW HAS A POINT. KIND OF FOOLISH FOR SOMEONE TO PAY $2.50 TO SEE IT IF HE COULD JUST PARK HIS CAR RIGHT ALONG HERE AND WATCH. OH. DO ME A FAVOR, WILL YOU? DON'T SPREAD THAT IDEA AROUND. OH, HELL, NO. BUSINESS... I KNOW THAT. BESIDES, I HAPPEN TO OWN THE LAND FOR 150 YARDS BOTH WAYS ALONG HERE. ANYBODY WANTS TO PARK TOMORROW AND WATCH, IT'S GONNA COST 'EM A DOLLAR. THAT PILOT SHOULD BE ALONG SOON. WE OUGHT TO GET MOVING. YOU EVER DONE THIS BEFORE? NOPE. YOU TELL ME WHAT TO DO, AND I'LL DO IT. HOW'S THE ALTIMETER? ALTIMETER? YEAH. FINE. ARE YOU SURE? SURE I'M SURE. WHY? MIGHT HELP TOMORROW IF WE KNEW HOW FAR WE ARE FROM THE GROUND. I'VE SEEN SOME ALTIMETERS THAT YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE. MINE YOU CAN BELIEVE. WELL, YOU HAVE AN HONEST FACE. I WAS BORN IN THIS TOWN. IS THAT A FACT? YOU DON'T SEEM VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT. I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE IN A LONG TIME. LEFT WHEN I WAS A KID. THAT'S THE BEST TIME TO LEAVE. I MIGHT EVEN HAVE SOME FAMILY HERE. THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY FAMILY. WELL, NOT REALLY FAMILY... AN AUNT AND AN UNCLE. IT'S A LONG STORY, AND I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE LONG STORIES, SO I WON'T TELL IT. THANK YOU. HELL... I WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO 'EM IF THEY WERE STILL HERE. START BY SAYING HELLO. SEE HOW IT GOES FROM THERE. WIND'S OUT THE SOUTH. HOPE IT STAYS THAT WAY. WHY? WELL, IF IT TURNS OUT OF THE NORTH WE HAVE TO COME IN OVER THOSE PHONE WIRES TO GET ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THAT GRANDSTAND. YEAH, WE HAD A GUY WORKING WITH US ONCE, HE HIT THE WIRES. HE GET HURT? KILLED HIM, AS A MATTER OF FACT. HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT A HOME-COOKED MEAL FOR A CHANGE? I CAN HARDLY WAIT. YOU CYNICAL BASTARD. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THESE PEOPLE. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO ADOPT US, BROWDY. THEY JUST WANT TO PUT US UP FOR A NIGHT. WILL YOU DO IT HERE, MIKE? I THINK THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD SPOT FOR IT. YOU THINK? WHO DOES IT, YOU OR RETTIG? LOOK, KID, THIS IS A BUSINESS. THEY DON'T PAY TO WATCH US WALK ACROSS THE STREET. NOW WHEN YOU GONNA GET THAT THROUGH YOUR HEAD? YOU'RE SO CONCERNED ABOUT RETTIG DOING THE CAPE JUMP, I MEAN, YOU CAN LEARN IT YOURSELF. THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HIM DOING IT. I HAVE A BETTER IDEA. WHY DON'T YOU DO IT? BECAUSE I RECOGNIZE MY LIMITATIONS. THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS IN LIFE. HEH HEH HEH. LITTERING THE PUBLIC THOROUGHFARE. $50 OR 10 DAYS, TAKE YOUR CHOICE. THAT'S A CHOICE? WELL, I SUPPOSE WE COULD MAKE A CASE FOR FLYING THAT PLANE AT A DANGEROUSLY LOW ALTITUDE, BUT TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I HAVEN'T THE FAINTEST IDEA WHAT THE STATUTE IS ON THAT. IT'S JUST TOO DAMN HOT. IF WE LIVED HERE, WE'D BE HOME NOW. IT'S MALCOLM. MALCOLM! WELL, MALCOLM, LOOK AT YOU. OHH! WELL, LOOK AT YOU. WHAT ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS? AREN'T THEY COMING IN? THEY'RE A LITTLE SHY. BROWDY! MIKE! LOOKS PRETTY NICE. SURE IS A HOT ONE TODAY, ISN'T IT? YES, ISN'T IT? NICE LITTLE TOWN YOU HAVE HERE. YES. MALCOLM TELLS US THAT YOU HAVE A NICE LITTLE COLLEGE HERE, TOO. MM-HMM. WE HAVE A COLLEGE. WE HAVE A COLLEGE AND A MISSILE BASE. TYPICAL LITTLE AMERICAN TOWN. MM-HMM. YOU CONNECTED WITH THE COLLEGE, ARE YOU? NO. I ALMOST WENT TO COLLEGE ONCE. REALLY? YEAH. WHY DIDN'T YOU? HMM? YOU SAID YOU ALMOST WENT TO COLLEGE. OH, YEAH. DIDN'T WORK OUT. HEH HEH HEH! OH, NO, PLEASE, GENTLEMEN, SIT DOWN. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THIS, MRS. BRANDON. OH, WE'RE DELIGHTED TO HAVE YOU. WE'VE PLENTY OF ROOM, MORE THAN WE CAN USE. AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE TAKE IN BOARDERS AS IT IS ALL THE TIME. YOU MAKE IT SOUND AS THOUGH WE HAD A "ROOMS TO LET" SIGN ON THE FRONT LAWN, ELIZABETH. WHAT MY WIFE MEANS IS THAT WE MAKE A ROOM AVAILABLE EACH YEAR FOR A STUDENT FROM THE COLLEGE. TO BE PRECISE. WHERE IS ANNIE, BY THE WAY? AT THE LIBRARY. IT'S, UH... IT'S ONLY LEMONADE, GENTLEMEN, BUT IF YOU'D CARE FOR SOMETHING STRONGER... OH, NO, MRS. BRANDON. I HAVEN'T HAD LEMONADE FOR YEARS. OF COURSE, THE KID HERE, HE NEVER TOUCHES ANYTHING STRONGER. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, KID? HARDLY EVER. HEH HEH HEH! OF COURSE, RETTIG... RETTIG, HE'LL DRINK ANYTHING. MY, IT'S STUFFY IN HERE, DON'T YOU THINK? WITH THE WINDOWS CLOSED, THE HOUSE COOLS OFF. NO USE LETTING ALL THE WARM AIR IN NOW, IS THERE? WELL, I'D... I'D RATHER HAVE THE WARM AIR THAN NO AIR AT ALL, BUT... OHH. MALCOLM. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE. IT'S BEEN SUCH A LONG TIME. I THINK MALCOLM WAS ABOUT 10 YEARS OLD WHEN WE LAST SAW HIM. YEAH, HE SAID IT'D BEEN A PRETTY LONG TIME. THE SUMMER YOU FELL OUT THE UPSTAIRS WINDOW. HE DIDN'T HAPPEN TO FALL ON HIS HEAD, DID HE? BECAUSE THAT WOULD EXPLAIN A FEW THINGS. WE'VE SEEN MALCOLM SINCE THEN. AT THE FUNERAL THE FOLLOWING YEAR, WASN'T IT? YES, OF COURSE. YES, THAT WAS THE FOLLOWING YEAR. YOU BEAR A MARKED RESEMBLANCE TO YOUR FATHER, MALCOLM. DOESN'T HE, ELIZABETH? YES, YOU DO. HOW LONG, UH, HOW LONG ARE YOU THINKING OF STAYING? OH, JUST THROUGH TOMORROW NIGHT. WE'LL HAVE TO LEAVE FIRST THING MONDAY MORNING. OH, BUT MONDAY'S THE FOURTH. OH, WE HAVE A WONDERFUL PARADE AND A FIREWORKS DISPLAY, OF COURSE, ON THE MONDAY NIGHT. YOU SHOULD AT LEAST STAY FOR THAT. WELL, THANK YOU, MRS. BRANDON, BUT WE REALLY HAVE TO BE SHOVING OFF. YOU EXPECT A GOOD CROWD TOMORROW? YEAH, WE EXPECT TO PICK UP A NICE PIECE OF CHANGE TOMORROW. PAYS WELL THEN, THIS SORT OF THING? IF WE MAKE IT INTERESTING ENOUGH. OH? HOW DO YOU DO THAT? MAKE IT INTERESTING? MM-HMM. YES, I MEAN, I SHOULDN'T THINK YOU'D HAVE TO DO ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR TO MAKE IT MORE INTERESTING THAN IT IS TO BEGIN WITH. WHAT BROWDY MEANS IS THE CLOSER WE COME TO THE GROUND, THE MORE INTERESTING IT IS FOR THE CUSTOMERS. AND FOR US, TOO, OF COURSE. HOW TERRIFYING. ELIZABETH, IT'S 3:30. HMM? YOU'LL BE LATE FOR YOUR MEETING. OHH! OH, YES, SO IT IS. OH, YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE ME. I'M THE CHAIRMAN. I HAVE TO BE THERE. WHY DON'T YOU TAKE ONE OF THEM ALONG WITH YOU? YOU COULD TELL THE LADIES ALL ABOUT YOUR EXCITING SHOW. I'D EXPECT YOU'D SELL QUITE A FEW TICKETS THAT WAY. I LIKE IT. WHAT DO YOU THINK, MRS. BRANDON? DO YOU THINK THE LADIES MIGHT BE INTERESTED? WELL, I'M SURE THEY'D BE FASCINATED... WHY DON'T I GO ALONG WITH MRS. BRANDON, THEN? YOU? WHILE YOU PUT THE POSTERS OUT AROUND TOWN. THE POSTERS ONLY TAKE A FEW MINUTES... AM I DRESSED ALL RIGHT, OR... NO, NO, YOU'RE FINE. I'LL GET THE CAR. IT REALLY DOES SOUND VERY EXCITING. YOU SAID IT WAS TERRIFYING. YES. WELL, I SUPPOSE IN A WAY THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT EXCITING, ISN'T IT? MOST ORDINARY PEOPLE CAN'T HELP BUT RESPOND TO THE IDEA OF SOME EXCITEMENT IN THEIR LIVES, YOU KNOW. EVEN IF IT TERRIFIES THEM? YES, EXACTLY. DO YOU REMEMBER THEM VERY WELL? NO. NO, I DON'T. YOUR MOTHER WAS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, A WONDERFUL WOMAN... MALCOLM? YO! KID, IT'S CLOUDING UP OUT THERE. I DON'T WANT THOSE CHUTES LEFT OUT IF IT RAINS. WELL, WHAT SHOULD WE DO WITH THEM? YOU CAN PUT THE TRAILER IN THE GARAGE, IF YOU'D LIKE. OH, THANKS, MR. BRANDON, THAT'D BE FINE IF YOU DON'T MIND. THE RADIO DID SAY RAIN. WELL, THEY'RE WRONG 9 TIMES OUT OF 10. I GOT AN ACCURATE REPORT OUT AT THE FIELD. BROWDY... ACTUALLY, THE FORECAST WAS FOR SHOWERS IN THE MORNING. YOU SEE? SHOWERS IN THE MORNING. COULDN'T HURT US. THE CUSTOMERS'LL COME. BROWDY... FORGET ABOUT THE CUSTOMERS. IF THE CHUTES GET DAMP... LOOK, THE CHUTES'LL BE IN THE GARAGE, RIGHT? SO THEY WON'T GET DAMP, RIGHT? SO STOP WORRYING ABOUT IT, RIGHT? BROWDY... THE GARAGE, THE GARAGE. BESIDES, LIKE RETTIG SAYS, WE HAVE TO MAKE IT INTERESTING FOR OURSELVES. NOW THERE ARE SEVERAL PLACES YOU CAN WEAR A CHUTE. ON YOUR BACK. ON YOUR CHEST. OR ON YOUR... OR YOU CAN SIT ON IT. NOW, LADIES, THIS PARTICULAR PARACHUTE, THE ONE I'M WEARING, IS CALLED A PARA-COMMANDER. IT'S A VERY SOPHISTICATED CHUTE AND QUITE HEAVY, AS YOU CAN SEE. IT TAKES QUITE A BIT OF PRACTICE TO GET USED TO IT. IN FACT, IT TAKES BETWEEN 25 AND SOMETIMES 50 JUMPS WITH A TRAINING CHUTE BEFORE YOU CAN HANDLE THIS BABY. I MENTION IT JUST IN CASE SOME OF YOU LADIES THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO TRY IT ONCE. NOW THIS DEVICE HERE IS YOUR RIPCORD HANDLE. THIS, WHEN PULLED SHARPLY, OPENS YOUR PACK. NOW WATCH THIS. OOH! OHH! SORRY. THIS IS YOUR PILOT CHUTE. THIS IS WHAT PULLS YOUR CANOPY COMPLETELY OUT OF THE PACK. LIKE THIS. THESE ARE YOUR SUSPENSION LINES. AS YOU CAN SEE, THEY EXTEND SOME 25 FEET FROM THE HARNESS THERE TO THE CANOPY. WHEN THE CANOPY POPS OPEN, YOU'RE TRAVELING DOWN TOWARD THE EARTH AT A SPEED OF 125 TO 200 MILES AN HOUR, DEPENDING ON THE ANGLE OF THE BODY. YES, MA'AM? WHAT IS A CANOPY? THIS, MA'AM. THIS IS A CANOPY. NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH SOME OF THE CANAPES YOU LADIES MIGHT HAVE WITH A MARTINI BEFORE DINNER. NO, NO, NO. ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE, LET'S TRY IT AGAIN FROM "B." AND, CLARINETS... COULD WE HEAR YOU? SOME VERVE. CON BRIO. PEP! ALL RIGHT, ARE WE READY? FROM "B." OH... YOU'RE MALCOLM. I'M ANNIE BURKE. THEY TOLD ME YOU WERE COMING. I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT, I... THAT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU PLAY VERY WELL. THANK YOU. BUT YOU'RE EITHER VERY KIND OR YOU KNOW NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT PLAYING THE PIANO. NO, I DON'T KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT IT, BUT I DO KNOW WHEN IT SOUNDS GOOD. YOU LIVE HERE, HUH? I RENT A ROOM. YOU GO TO THE COLLEGE? IN THE SUMMER? I FAILED A COURSE LAST SEMESTER. I'M MAKING IT UP. THEY TOLD ME WHAT YOU DO. IT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS. I SUPPOSE IT DOES. WHY DID YOU DO THIS? DO WHAT? COME HERE. TO SELL SOME TICKETS. I DIDN'T WANT TO TURN DOWN YOUR HUSBAND'S INVITATION. YOUR FRIEND COULD'VE COME... MR. BROWDY. YOUR HUSBAND DIDN'T INVITE MR. BROWDY. YOU HAVE CONTEMPT FOR US, DON'T YOU? WHO? WELL... CERTAINLY EVERYBODY HERE THIS AFTERNOON. MAYBE EVERYONE ELSE, TOO. I DON'T KNOW. BUT CERTAINLY US. WHY ARE WE CONTEMPTIBLE TO YOU? DO YOU CARE? NO, AS A MATTER OF FACT, I HAVEN'T BEEN BACK SINCE I LEFT. ABOUT 12 YEARS AGO NOW. I WAS A KID. WHERE DOES YOUR FAMILY LIVE NOW? THEY'RE DEAD. OH. UH, THAT'S WHY I LEFT. THEY WERE KILLED IN A CAR ACCIDENT. I GUESS MY FATHER WAS DRUNK. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT AT THE TIME, OF COURSE, BUT LATER I FIGURED THAT'S WHAT IT MUST'VE BEEN. HE WAS A PRETTY RECKLESS CHARACTER ALL AROUND, I GUESS. ANYWAY, THEY PUT ME IN THIS HOME. I WAS ADOPTED OUT A COUPLE OF TIMES, AND... WELL, WHY DIDN'T THEY EVER TAKE YOU? THE BRANDONS? I NEVER ASKED. BEATS MOTELS, HUH, KID? YEAH. LISTEN, WHAT WAS THAT THIS AFTERNOON? I MEAN, UH, WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT? WHAT WAS WHAT ALL ABOUT? I CAN'T QUITE SEE YOU MAKING SPEECHES TO LADIES CLUBS, RETTIG. I MEAN, I TRY, BUT I CAN'T QUITE PICTURE IT. YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN THERE. I WAS A BIG HIT. I DON'T DOUBT THAT. WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND, KID? APPLETON. FORGET IT. DO YOU? I DON'T THINK ABOUT IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. YOU ALMOST WENT INTO THE GROUND. SAME THING AT LAWRENCEVILLE. NOW, HOW CAN YOU NOT THINK ABOUT THAT? I SAID FORGET IT. REMEMBER WHAT YOU ALWAYS SAID WHEN I FIRST STARTED WITH YOU? "BE CAREFUL." THAT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS SAID. "THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT IN THIS BUSINESS, KID. BE CAREFUL." IS THAT WHAT I ALWAYS SAID? WHY ARE YOU TAKING SO MANY CHANCES NOW? WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO PROVE? WE'LL BE JUMPING FROM A HOWARD DGA-15. DGA. THAT STANDS FOR DAMN GOOD AIRPLANE, WHICH, OF COURSE, IT IS. VERY TRICKY TO LAND, THOUGH. YOU'RE MUCH BETTER OFF JUMPING OUT OF IT THEN YOU ARE TAKING YOUR CHANCE ON LANDING IT. THIS ONE'S IN GOOD SHAPE. WITH BROWDY, A AIRPLANE'S IN GOOD SHAPE IF IT HAS WINGS AND A PROP. WE'VE HAD A LOT WORSE. YOU REMEMBER THAT TIME IN ADLER? WE HAD AN AIRPLANE IN ADLER THAT NEVER EVEN GOT OFF THE GROUND. HIT THE END OF THE RUNWAY, WENT INTO A CORNFIELD, HARVESTED ABOUT AN ACRE OF CORN BEFORE THE PILOT COULD GET IT STOPPED. ARE YOU GOING TO WATCH US JUMP TOMORROW? OH, YES. YES, WE'LL BE THERE, WON'T BE, ELIZABETH? YES, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. WHAT IS THE MOST DANGEROUS STUNT THAT YOU DO? THE CAPE STUNT. THAT'S A STUNT WE DO WITH A CAPE. AHH. DO YOU DO THAT ONE? OH, NO. RETTIG DOES THAT ONE. WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHY YOU DO THIS THING AT ALL. FOR ME, IT'S A BUSINESS. AND YOU, MR. RETTIG. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, IF YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING? I HAD A FRIEND IN THE ARMY, A SERGEANT... PARACHUTED FOR ABOUT 20 YEARS. HE USED TO SAY THAT JUMPING WAS NOT ONLY A WAY TO LIVE... BUT ALSO A WAY TO DIE. VERY FEW THINGS ARE. THAT'S VERY INTERESTING. "HE IS AT LIBERTY TO DIE WHO DOES NOT WISH TO LIVE." YOU BELIEVE THAT? THAT'S DEAD WRONG. ARE YOU A RELIGIOUS MAN, MR. BROWDY? WHAT'S RELIGION HAVE TO DO WITH IT? BROWDY GOES TO CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY. OK, OK, KID. DOES THAT EMBARRASS YOU, MR. BROWDY? NO, IT DOESN'T EMBARRASS ME. I MEAN, WHY SHOULD IT EMBARRASS ME? LISTEN, IF WE GONNA GO DOWNTOWN FOR THAT BEER, WE'D BETTER GET STARTED. IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US, MRS. BRANDON. YEAH, I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. ANYBODY KNOW OF A GOOD PLACE IN TOWN? WE'RE OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS. THE HORSE'S HEAD IS NICE. OH, I THINK THE HORSE'S HEAD IS A BIT ON THE QUAINT SIDE, DON'T YOU, ANNIE? THE PARADISE MIGHT BE MORE THE SORT OF PLACE THAT WOULD APPEAL TO YOU. WHAT SORT OF PLACE WOULD APPEAL TO US? WELL, I JUST MEANT THAT IT WAS LIVELY. I INTENDED NO OFFENSE. UH, ANNIE, WOULD YOU CARE TO COME ALONG? UH, DO YOU HAVE OTHER PLANS? THANK YOU, I HAVE. I HAVE A DATE. MM-HMM, ALL RIGHT. THAT'S THE BREAKS, KID. RETTIG, ARE YOU COMING? MRS. BRANDON, UH, A VERY NICE SUPPER. OHH, YOU'RE WELCOME. IS THAT YOURS? YOU WISH. WHAT'S IT FOR? MONEY FOR THE JUKEBOX. HEH HEH HEH. THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE SMALL-TOWN STUFF TO ME. NOTHING LOOKS LIKE SMALL-TOWN STUFF TO YOU. AND WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT? ALL RIGHT! OK, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU BOYS? WELL, UM... YEAH, RIGHT. BESIDES THAT. WHY DON'T WE START WITH 3 BEERS, AND WE'LL GO ON FROM THERE AND SEE WHAT DEVELOPS. RIGHT. WHAT DO YOU THINK, MIKE? I THINK DEFINITELY. ONE OF THESE DAYS, YOU'RE GONNA BE WRONG. I HOPE I'M THERE TO SEE IT. I WAS WRONG ONCE. ABOUT, UH, 1953, I THINK, WASN'T IT? HA HA! WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THESE PEOPLE, MIKE? WHAT PEOPLE? THE BRANDONS. I DON'T KNOW. WHAT SHOULD I MAKE OF THEM? KIND OF PECULIAR, DON'T YOU THINK? NO OFFENSE, KID. IT'S NOTHING TO ME, BROWDY. THEY'RE AS MUCH STRANGERS TO ME AS THEY ARE TO YOU. I MUST SAY, THE THREE OF YOU DON'T ACT MUCH LIKE A FAMILY. TELL YOU ONE THING, THOUGH. SHE'S ONE GOOD-LOOKING WOMAN. CLASS. IT WAS SO QUIET, I WONDERED WHERE YOU WERE. I'M HERE. SIT DOWN. TAKE A LOAD OFF. HEY! YOU GONNA COME OUT TOMORROW AND WATCH US JUMP? JUMP WHAT? HA HA HA! HERE. BE OUR GUEST. OHH! YOU'RE THEM! YEAH, WE'RE THEM! WHERE'S YOUR AIRPLANE? HEH HEH HEH! IT'S PARKED OUTSIDE. HERE. BRING A FRIEND IF YOU WANT. MY BOYFRIEND, MAYBE? THINK HE'D GET ALONG WITH MIKE? WELL, IF HE DIDN'T, I COULD. AHH, NO, NO. HE'S MARRIED AND GOT 7 KIDS. YEAH, SURE, I'LL BET. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? MARY. HEH HEH HEH! YOU'RE KIDDING. NO, AND IF YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT MY BEING CONTRARY OR HOW MY GARDEN GROWS, I SCREAM. I LOVE HER. I REALLY DO. WILL YOU MARRY ME? YEAH, RIGHT. TUESDAY. I'M TIED UP TILL THEN. OK. SEE YOU LATER. WHERE ARE YOU GOIN'? FOR A WALK. OH, HO HO HO! I THINK I'M TAKING OFF, TOO. THE MUSIC'S GIVING ME A HEADACHE. WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA LEAVE OLD BROWDY TO HIS OWN DEVICES? HEH! DON'T FORGET TOMORROW'S SUNDAY. THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIND A CHURCH? AHH, GET LOST, WILL YA? SMELL IT? LOOK... IF IT RAINS, WE DON'T JUMP. THAT'S SIMPLE ENOUGH, ISN'T IT? SIMPLE ENOUGH. DO YOU WANT SOME COMPANY? NO. YOU DON'T MIND, DO YOU, KID? RETTIG. MAYBE YOU'LL FORGET THE CAPE STUNT TOMORROW, HUH? MIGHT NOT BE A BAD DAY FOR IT. THE AIR IS DAMP, HEAVIER. SLOWER DESCENT. BY HOW MUCH? A COUPLE OF SECONDS? WHAT DOES THAT MATTER? YOU CAN ONLY STAY UP SO LONG. THEN YOU HAVE TO COME DOWN, RIGHT? THAT'S RIGHT. SOMETIMES, I THINK YOU HATE TO COME BACK TO THE GROUND AT ALL. BEAUTIFUL NIGHT. LITTLE COOLER. YOU'RE ALL BACK EARLY. NO. I'M ALONE. WE'RE A LITTLE OUT OF PLACE HERE, AREN'T WE? BROWDY AND I, ANYWAY. WHY, OF COURSE NOT. WE'RE DELIGHTED TO HAVE YOU. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. DO WHAT? BE POLITE, GRACIOUS. IT'S NOT NECESSARY. YOU'RE VERY DIRECT, AREN'T YOU? NOT VERY SUBTLE, YOU MEAN. NO. I DIDN'T SAY THAT. I THINK YOU ALL ARE VERY SUBTLE, BUT IN A DIRECT SORT OF WAY. WANT A DRINK OR SOMETHING? ARE YOU MARRIED? NO. WERE YOU, EVER? YES. WHAT ABOUT MALCOLM? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? HE MEANS A LOT TO YOU, DOESN'T HE? HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN OURS. I MEAN, WE MIGHT HAVE RAISED HIM... AFTER HIS MOTHER AND FATHER WERE KILLED. BUT YOU DIDN'T. JOHN DIDN'T WANT HIM. DID YOU? YES, I WANTED HIM. MALCOLM'S MOTHER WAS MY SISTER. I WAS IN LOVE WITH WALT, MALCOLM'S FATHER. IT WAS SORT OF TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT WE WOULD BE MARRIED. ONLY, I... I DON'T KNOW. I... I GUESS I JUST WASN'T VERY OBSERVANT. ONE DAY, WALT AND ELEANOR DISAPPEARED, AND WHEN THEY CAME BACK A FEW DAYS LATER, THEY WERE MARRIED. AND AFTER A WHILE... AFTER WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED A SUITABLE PERIOD OF MOURNING... I MARRIED JOHN. AND IT WAS ALL RIGHT, TOO, FOR A LONG TIME. I MEAN, WE LIKED EACH OTHER. WE REALLY DID. AND THEN THERE WAS THE ACCIDENT, AND... MALCOLM WAS LEFT WITH NO ONE, AND... JOHN DIDN'T WANT HIM. I COULDN'T BLAME HIM FOR THAT, REALLY. HE KNEW I WANTED MALCOLM BECAUSE HE WAS WALT'S CHILD. IT WAS HIS RIGHT NOT TO WANT HIM FOR THE SAME REASON. WHY DO YOU STAY MARRIED TO HIM? WHY NOT? I IMAGINE YOU'RE THE SORT OF MAN WHO ALWAYS MANAGES TO FIND THE BEST AND RIGHTEST REASONS FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO. DO YOU THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE FOR EVERYONE? I'M ALWAYS HOPEFUL. COME IN. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I HAVE A RIP IN THIS. IT'S, UH... PART OF MY COSTUME. BROWDY LIKES FOR US TO LOOK NEAT. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO DO IT FOR YOU? NO, THANKS. I SEW PRETTY GOOD. NO LUCK TONIGHT? WITH WHAT? WELL, USUALLY THERE ARE A LOT OF UNATTACHED GIRLS AT THE PARADISE. I GUESS I HIT AN OFF NIGHT. HOW WAS YOUR DATE? OK. SIT DOWN. HEY. TAXI! COME HERE! WHOOPSY-DAISY! HA HA HA HA! IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT, YOUNG FELLA? I'M NEW AROUND TOWN HERE, OFFICER. UH... I SAY, I JUST REMEMBERED MY CAR IS RIGHT DOWN THE STREET. HA HA HA HA! AAH! WHOOPSY-DAISY! I ONCE JUMPED OUT OF THIS WINDOW. WITH WHAT? IT WAS WHEN I WAS A KID. I WONDERED WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO JUMP FROM THIS HIGH UP. I THINK I HAD IT IN THE BACK OF MY MIND THAT I COULD FLY. LOOK ALL RIGHT? YEAH. THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. THANKS. TELL YOU WHAT I'M GONNA DO ONE OF THESE DAYS. ONE OF THESE DAYS, I'M GONNA CUT OUT, AND I'M GONNA GO OUT TO HOLLYWOOD. I'M GONNA GET ME A JOB AS ONE OF THEM STUNT MEN. THEY MAKE GOOD DOUGH. I KNOW THAT FOR A FACT. AH... YOU ASLEEP? HEY... YOU ASLEEP? I'M NOT GONNA BE DOING THIS FOREVER. I HAVE PLANS. LORD, I AM NOT WORTHY THAT YOU SHOULD COME UNDER MY ROOF. SPEAK BUT THE WORD, AND MY SOUL SHALL BE HEALED. LORD, I AM NOT WORTHY THAT YOU SHOULD COME UNDER MY ROOF. SPEAK BUT THE WORD, AND MY SOUL SHALL BE HEALED. LORD, I AM NOT WORTHY THAT YOU SHOULD COME UNDER MY ROOF. SPEAK BUT THE WORD, AND MY SOUL SHALL BE HEALED. HE KNOWS, DOESN'T HE? DOES IT HAPPEN OFTEN? NO, NOT OFTEN... BUT IT HAPPENS. ARE YOU SURPRISED? TOMORROW, WHEN WE LEAVE HERE, I WANT YOU TO COME WITH ME. COME WITH YOU? YES. YOU... DO YOU ALWAYS OFFER SO MUCH MORE THAN YOU'RE ASKED FOR? ONLY TO THOSE WHO ASK SO MUCH LESS THAN THEY WANT. IF IT WAS WHAT I WANT, DO YOU THINK I COULD ACCEPT IT? THERE'S ALWAYS ANOTHER CHOICE. DON'T YOU SEE THAT? NOT FOR EVERYONE. FOR EVERYONE. HOW DO YOU COME TO HAVE THIS WONDERFUL FREEDOM OF CHOICE? YOU TAKE IT. FROM WHOM? FROM ANYONE WHO SAYS IT ISN'T YOURS TO TAKE. OH, I ENVY YOU. DON'T ENVY ME. JOIN ME. LEAVE ME ALONE. DO IT. A MERCIFUL STRANGER COME TO SAVE ME FROM THE TERRIBLE BOREDOM AND LOVELESSNESS OF MY LIFE! IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK YOU ARE? I'M ONLY OFFERING YOU A WAY OUT. I DON'T WANT A WAY OUT! OH, WELL. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE. YOU HAVE TO WANT IT. IT'S EARLY. COULD STOP ANYTIME. GOOD, STIFF WIND OUT THERE. BLOW IT AWAY IN A COUPLE HOURS. GOT 650 TICKETS ON ME. 650 TICKETS. TERRIFIC! LOOK, KID, UH... THE BUSINESS IS MY END OF IT. YOU LET ME TAKE CARE OF ME. IT'S ALL YOURS, BROWDY. ALL RIGHT. WELL, STOP NEEDLING ME FOR WORRYING ABOUT IT, THEN, OK? I MEAN, I DON'T NOTICE YOU PASSING UP YOUR CUT WHEN IT COMES TIME TO SPLIT THE TAKE. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I THINK YOU HAVE A CASH REGISTER FOR A HEAD. YEAH, YEAH. ALL RIGHT, KID, FINE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO JUMP IF YOU THINK IT'S TOO DANGEROUS. I MEAN, RETTIG AND ME CAN MAKE OUT OURSELVES. WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN... STOP TALKING TO ME, WILL YOU? IF I "THINK IT'S TOO DANGEROUS"? JUST WHAT I SAID. YOUR CHICKEN STREAK IS SHOWING! MY CHICKEN STREAK! THAT'S WHAT I SAID, YOUR CHICKEN STREAK! LISTEN, PAL. I'VE SEEN YOUR HANDS SHAKING AND SWEATY UP THERE. I'VE SEEN YOU TRYING TO TALK TO YOURSELF INTO JUST ONE MORE JUMP, AND THE NEXT, AND THE... JUST A SLIGHT MISUNDERSTANDING, MRS. BRANDON. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY, KID. I'M A LITTLE BIT ON EDGE. WE'RE A LITTLE ON EDGE. YOUR NOSE IS BLEEDIN', KID. BROWDY. YOU EVER SEE HIM SWEAT, KID? YOU EVER SEE HIS HANDS SHAKE UP THERE? NO. I NEVER HAVE, BROWDY. WHERE'S YOUR CROWD? THEY'LL COME. WE'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. DEFINITELY. HEY! HEY! HI! GOOD MORNING! OK! HOW'S OUR AIRPLANE? WELL, I'M FINISHED. SHE'S GASSED UP, AND THE SEATS TURNED AROUND, AND THE DOOR'S OFF. BOY, THAT DOORWAY'S PRETTY NARROW, HUH? SEEIN' HOW THE THREE OF YOU ARE GONNA GET OUT OF THERE AT ONE TIME. IT'S ALL RIGHT. WE'RE USED TO IT. LISTEN, RETTIG'S GONNA TELL YOU WHAT HE WANTS YOU TO DO, BUT THE MAIN THING FOR YOU TO DO IS JUST GET BACK DOWN ON THE GROUND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER EVERY JUMP. NOW, A LONG WAIT IS VERY BAD FOR A CROWD. THEY GET RESTLESS. YOU SEE? GOT IT. OK. JUST DON'T GET DOWN BEFORE WE DO. WELL, IF I DO THAT, I'M GONNA SHORTEN THE PROGRAM CONSIDERABLY. HA HA! THAT'S VERY GOOD. UH, THERE'S A GUY UP THERE SETTIN' UP A P.A. SYSTEM. WILL YOU GIVE HIM THAT AND ASK HIM TO GIVE US AN OUTLET? RIGHT. HERE. SAY, THIS IS REALLY EXCITING, YOU KNOW? I MEAN, I NEVER DID ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. TERRIFIC. THERE'S A COUPLE KIDS AROUND, IF YOU STIR 'EM UP AND SEND 'EM IN TO MAKE A COUPLE BUCKS FOR THE AFTERNOON. THAT'S NOT GONNA BE HARD. YEAH. RIGHT. I'M READY. YOU CERTAIN THAT YOU WON'T COME ALONG? YOU'RE NOT COMING, MRS. BRANDON? OK, NOW, LOOK. WHEN WE COME DOWN IN THE PARACHUTE, WE NEED SOME HELP. I WANT TWO OF YOU TO COME OUT ON EACH PARACHUTE, AND YOU GRAB IT, AND THEN YOU HELP US COLLAPSE IT, OK? YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? YES. OK, BUT THE MAIN THING IS FOR YOU TO GET US AS MANY PARACHUTES OUT THERE ON THAT TABLE IN FRONT OF THE STANDS AS POSSIBLE. WE WANT PLENTY OF PARACHUTES, RIGHT? RIGHT. OK, IT'S TIME NOW. NOW, LISTEN, EVERYONE. DON'T LIFT ANY MORE THAN YOU CAN CARRY, OK? OK. MR. BROWDY? YEAH. I'M THE AMBULANCE SERVICE. WELL, WHERE IS IT? PARKED OUT BEHIND THE HANGAR. WELL, COME ON. LET'S GET IT OUT HERE SO THEY CAN SEE IT. WELL, I DON'T... I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. WELL, IT'S JUST PART OF THE ACT, YOU UNDERSTAND. I MEAN, WE'RE NOT GONNA NEED IT. KNOCK WOOD. WE HAVE TO LET THEM SEE THAT. YOU GOT IT? OH, I UNDERSTAND. I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN. YOU DRIVE THAT AMBULANCE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE STANDS NICE AND SLOW, ALL RIGHT? AND YOU GET THE LIGHT GOING, AND LET'S MAKE SOME NOISE, HUH? UNDERSTAND? PARK IT RIGHT OVER THERE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STANDS. YOU GOT IT? RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. GO. YOU DIG THAT CROWD? YEAH.

UH, NO. NO, I, UH, I THINK I GOT IT. WHAT'S THE MATTER? LITTLE NERVOUS. YOU'RE GONNA GET OVER IT REAL SOON, AREN'T YOU? OH, YEAH. JUST DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. ARE WE ALL SET? HEY, FELLAS, SAY HELLO TO DICK DONFORD. HE'S FROM THE LOCAL RADIO STATION. HI. I'LL BE DOING THE COMMENTARY ON ALL OF THE JUMPS. THE STUNTS THAT I GO UP ON, YOU JUST DESCRIBE WHAT YOU SEE AND, UH, ADD A LITTLE COLOR. USE YOUR IMAGINATION. RIGHT, RIGHT. I'VE DONE A LOT OF SPORTS EVENTS. YOU KNOW, BASKETBALL GAMES, THAT KIND OF STUFF. THAT'S RIGHT. JUST CALL IT LIKE A BASKETBALL GAME. ATTENTION. ATTENTION, PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON... I DON'T SEE ANNIE. ...FOR COMING OUT HERE TO WATCH US THIS AFTERNOON. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE DISAPPOINTED. I THINK I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT. WE HAVE SOME VERY FINE STUNTS LINED UP FOR YOU. WHICH ONE IS HE? THE ONE IN WHITE. I LIKE THE ONE IN THE RED BETTER. YEAH. SO DID I. OH, WHAT THE HELL? THE WAY THINGS WORKED OUT, I GOT NO COMPLAINTS. DID I INTRODUCE OURSELVES? NO, I DIDN'T. IN THE YELLOW JUMPSUIT, A LOCAL BOY MAKING GOOD, MR. MALCOLM WEBSON. LET'S HEAR IT FOR MALCOLM. IN THE RED JUMPSUIT, A GENTLEMAN WHO'S GONNA DO SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL FOR YOU LATER ON THIS AFTERNOON, MR. MIKE RETTIG. LET'S HEAR IT FOR MIKE! AND ME! MY NAME IS BROWDY! CUT. HERE HE COMES! THERE'S HIS CHUTE! OH! WHAT'S THIS?! WHAT'S THIS?! WHAT'S HAPPENING?! LOOKS LIKE HE LOST SOMETHING. I GUESS IT'S A JOKE! UH, WE HAVE A LITTLE PROBLEM HERE. THAT JUMPSUIT THAT I LOST HAPPENED TO BE THE ONLY ONE THAT I HAVE. WE HAVE PEOPLE OUT ALL OVER THE COUNTRYSIDE LOOKING FOR IT. SO, UM, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH YOU AS SOON AS WE FIND IT. HOW DO YOU FEEL? IN THE MEANTIME, I THOUGHT MAYBE I MIGHT MAKE MYSELF USEFUL AROUND HERE, BY GOING UP WITH THE FELLAS AND DESCRIBING A JUMP RIGHT FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW. YOU KNOW, KIND OF A CHANGE OF PACE. HOW'S THAT SOUND TO YOU, HUH? ARE YOU READY, FOLKS? OK! OH, UH, INCIDENTALLY, THERE'S A REWARD FOR THAT JUMPSUIT. ANYBODY FINDING THAT JUMPSUIT GETS A FREE PARACHUTE JUMP. * OFF WE GO INTO THE WILD BLUE YONDER * * CLIMBING HIGH INTO THE SUN * HEY, DOWN THERE, CAN YOU HEAR ME?! IF YOU CAN HEAR ME, LET'S HEAR IT! COME ON! LET'S HEAR IT! NO, THAT'S NOT LOUD ENOUGH. COME ON! LET'S HEAR IT! HEY! THAT'S A LOT BETTER. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT UP HERE. I WISH YOU WERE ALL UP HERE WITH ME. MIKE AND MALCOLM ARE GETTING THEMSELVES SET NOW. I THINK YOU'RE GONNA LIKE THIS STUNT. IT'S THE ONE THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW. I'M GETTING THE GO-AHEAD FROM MIKE NOW. OK. THERE THEY GO. OK, THEY'RE OFF. SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THEM ABOUT NOW. IT LOOKS GOOD. IT LOOKS REAL GOOD. YEAH, IT'S REAL GOOD. OH! I'M FALLING OUT! I FELL OUT! OH, NO! IS THERE A DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE?! I THINK I'M GONNA FAINT! OH, I WANT Y'ALL TO KNOW HOW MUCH I'VE ENJOYED BEING A PART OF THIS SHOW. I KNOW THAT MIKE RETTIG AND MALCOLM ARE GONNA CARRY ON WITHOUT ME. I'D LIKE YOU TO TELL THEM FOR ME, WILL YOU? NOW, I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO BE UPSET. NOW, THESE ARE THE CHANCES WE TAKE. WE ALL KNOW IT COULD HAPPEN ANYTIME. ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE STUPID ENOUGH TO FALL OUT OF A PLANE WITHOUT A CHUTE. HA HA HA HA. TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I'M NOT THAT STUPID. NO, I GUESS I BETTER OPEN UP THIS PARACHUTE NOW, BEFORE THIS JOKE GOES A LITTLE TOO FAR. NOW COMES THE MOST DANGEROUS AND EXCITING STUNT OF THE AFTERNOON. I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT WE ALL DREW LOTS TO SEE WHO WAS GONNA PERFORM THIS PARTICULAR STUNT, BUT THAT'D BE A LIE BECAUSE MALCOLM AND I ARE CHICKEN, UH, MIKE RETTIG. SERIOUSLY, THOUGH, AS FAR AS WE KNOW, MIKE IS THE ONLY PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY PERFORMING THIS PARTICULAR STUNT AT THE PRESENT TIME. WEARING A SPECIALLY-DESIGNED CAPE, MIKE IS GONNA JUMP AND DO SOME VERY NICE THINGS FOR YOU ON THE WAY DOWN. HE'LL BE TRAVELING IN EXCESS OF 200 MILES AN HOUR. NOW, UP TO NOW, THE FASTEST WE'VE GONE IS ABOUT 100, SO YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE. ANOTHER THING, UNLESS HE HOLDS HIS ARMS ABSOLUTELY CORRECTLY, THE WIND CAN BREAK THEM RIGHT OFF. ALSO, ATTACHED TO EACH FOOT WILL BE THIS SMOKE FLARE SO HE'LL LEAVE A TRAIL THROUGH THE SKY THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW. THAT IS, UNLESS THE FLARE MALFUNCTIONS AND BURNS HIS LEG, WHICH THEY HAVE A NASTY HABIT OF DOING. HEY, MIKE RETTIG! NOW, LET'S HEAR IT FOR MIKE! COME ON! LET'S HEAR IT! SEE YA, KID. RETTIG... DON'T BE LATE FOR SUPPER. THERE'S THE AIRCRAFT. CUT. THE FLARES ARE LIT! PULL IT. PULL IT! RETTIG! GET OUT OF HERE. GET OUT OF HERE! GET OUT OF HERE! WHAT'S THE MATTER, YOU MORBID CREEPS, YOU?! COME ON! GET OUT OF HERE! COME ON! GET OUT OF HERE! MOVE 'EM BACK, DAMN IT! WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG WITH YOU?! GET OUT OF HERE! MALCOLM? YOU ALL RIGHT? IT'S ALL SET FOR TUESDAY... HERE IN BRIDGEVILLE. LISTEN... LISTEN, KID, I DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THIS ANY MORE THAN YOU DO, BUT... WE GOTTA GET SOME DOUGH... I MEAN, FOR THE BURIAL AND EVERYTHING. TOMORROW'S THE FOURTH, AND I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD PUT ON A SHORT PROGRAM, CALL IT A MEMORIAL JUMP, SOMETHING LIKE THAT, MAYBE ONLY DO ONE JUMP. I'D GET ON TELEVISION AND RADIO TONIGHT AND NEWSPAPERS TOMORROW MORNING FOR SURE. THEN TOMORROW WE'LL JUST PASS THE HAT. WHAT DO YOU THINK? WHO'D COME TO SEE ONE JUMP? WELL, I... UNLESS... WE JUMP THE CAPE. THAT'S NOT NECESSARY. WE CAN LEND YOU THE MONEY FOR THE BURIAL. MRS. BRANDON, UH... THAT WOULDN'T BE GOOD AT ALL. I MEAN, UH... YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT, CAN'T YOU? OK. I'LL DO IT. HAS HE DONE THIS... THIS JUMP BEFORE? NO. YOU WANT ME TO DO IT? DO WHAT? THE JUMP TOMORROW. I MEAN, WE DIDN'T REALLY, REALLY TALK ABOUT IT. YOU JUST SAID YOU'D DO IT. I'LL DO IT. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH ONE OF US DOES IT, SO I'LL DO IT. I JUMPED THE CAPE ONCE, YOU KNOW. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. ONCE... A LONG TIME AGO. SOMETHING WEIRD ABOUT THAT STUNT. RETTIG ISN'T THE FIRST ONE TO GO IN THE GROUND DOING THAT ONE. I ALMOST DID MYSELF... THE ONE TIME I JUMPED THE CAPE. I MEAN, THERE WAS A COUPLE SECONDS THERE WHEN... I THINK I FELT LIKE THE CAPE WOULD ACTUALLY KEEP ME UP. LIKE I HAD WINGS OR SOMETHING. IT WAS CRAZY. ALMOST DIDN'T PULL THE RIPCORD. CLOSE... I CAME REALLY CLOSE. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF GUYS RIDE THE CAPE RIGHT INTO THE GROUND. I GUESS YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE THE KIND THAT MIGHT DO THAT UNTIL YOU'VE RIDDEN THE CAPE ONCE. AT LEAST ONCE. LET'S HOLD IT. ALL RIGHT, NOW. ONCE AGAIN FROM THE BEGINNING. AND REMEMBER, PEOPLE, TIME IS SHORT. TIME IS VERY SHORT. AND THAT CONCLUDES THE NATIONAL NEWS. COME IN. WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO ANNOUNCE THAT TOMORROW'S FOURTH OF JULY PARADE WILL START AT CITY HALL AND THEN PROCEED NORTH ON MAIN STREET. HUGE CROWDS ARE EXPECTED, SO IF YOU'RE THINKING OF TRAVELING THROUGH THE DOWNTOWN AREA, YOU'RE ADVISED TO USE OUTLYING ALTERNATE ROUTES. WE'LL KEEP YOU ADVISED, SO FOR UP-TO-THE-MINUTE TRAFFIC BULLETINS, STAY TUNED TO THIS STATION. AND HERE'S THE WEATHER REPORT. THE WEATHERMAN HAS PROMISED TEMPERATURES IN THE HIGH NINETIES, SO DRESS ACCORDINGLY. NOW FOR THE LOCAL BASEBALL SCORES. I KEEP REMEMBERING MYSELF STARING AT THE AIRPLANE THIS AFTERNOON. STANDING THERE LOOKING AT HIM... WANTING TO SAY SOMETHING. LIKE THERE WERE SOME MAGIC WORD TO SAVE HIM. I COULDN'T SAY THAT WORD... 'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. PAY ATTENTION, DAMN IT! CUT. OK, PULL IT! COME ON! PULL IT! RETTIG! TERRIFIC! TERRIFIC! YOU SCARED THE HELL OUTTA ME! WHAT'D YOU WAIT SO LONG TO PULL FOR?! BEAUTIFUL! BEAUTIFUL! WHEN YOU PULLED IT, YOU REALLY PULLED IT, DIDN'T YOU? RIGHT OUT OF THE PACK. HEY, KID, YOU READY? JUST ABOUT. IS EVERYTHING... YEAH, EVERYTHING'S ALL TAKEN CARE OF. ARE YOU LEAVING, TOO, MR. BROWDY? NO. I'LL BE STAYING THROUGH TOMORROW FOR THE FUNERAL, BUT I SEE NO POINT IN MY STAYING HERE TONIGHT. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IT WOULDN'T FEEL RIGHT IF THE KID WAS GONE. WELL, LISTEN, I... I'LL WAIT FOR YOU DOWNSTAIRS. YOU HAVE ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR BEFORE THE TRAIN. MALCOLM... YOU WON'T STAY FOR A WHILE, THOUGH? WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I DON'T KNOW. WILL YOU LET US KNOW HOW YOU ARE FROM TIME TO TIME? I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW YOU ARE. I WILL. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, BROWDY? WELL, I THOUGHT I MIGHT HEAD WEST. I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT A LOT LATELY. I THINK I MIGHT JUST HEAD WEST. BUT YOU NEVER CAN TELL WHAT MIGHT TURN UP. RIGHT? YOU DON'T MIND MY NOT STAYING, DO YOU... FOR TOMORROW? I... GET LOST, WILL YOU? HEY, KID? NEXT TIME YOU GET IN AN AIRPLANE, MAKE SURE IT'S GOT A DOOR ON IT. HEH HEH. HE WANTED ME TO GO WITH HIM. DID HE? THE THOUGHT TERRIFIED ME. AND ME.
