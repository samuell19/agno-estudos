Greetings sir Fun for the dogs..and the participants too. And I hope everyone who is waiting for this will have fun. Without wasting your time, let's get started. Our panel of judges is warmly welcomed to this year's program. His animals not only saved people from danger, It stood as a nation in war crises. Sincerely, Mr. Pradham Singh, from Amritsar. Welcome to the panel, sir. And from Kolkata, we have dog psychologist Namrita Banerjee. Founder of Animal Care Foundation and Adoption Center, Mr. Vivaan Sharma, from Delhi. Also, the animal welfare officer who has won many awards, Ms. Devika Aaradhya, from Karnataka. Hello, hi.. Today we have a very respectable panel of judges. What else can we expect? So let's turn this over to our first participant. Mr. Ashok Rathore and Sarama. Come on Ashok.. They seem to be in good faith. Let's see if they can win the trophy this time. A brisk start, wickets without a lot of bounces. Speeding along the tunnel. Speeding across the dog track. An easy jump from the ring. Passing the wave pool is still a difficult task. It seems that he is very familiar with these. High penalty for injury.. From you again.. A ride from the See -So. Moving towards the A -frame. And the final leap. Sarana's show of incredible talent. Even though he is a two and a half year old Belglane. So now let's give a big round of applause to our second contestant. Mr. who came from Lucknow. To Kashi. With their two -year -old Doberman, winner of the 24th NADC. What's up here? Participate? best wishes! Made the first jump from the hurdle. A memorable leap. Coming through the tunnel. A person who has a good handle on slopes. And a quick jump through the ring. Did a good job with the wavepool. It's great to see them performing together. Ladies and gentlemen. That is the most difficult jump any dog â€‹â€‹will ever take. And that is the last leap to jump. They finished it. So let's welcome our next contestant, Dharma and Charlie. A one and a half year old Labrador. Look at Charlie's energy and activity. Looks like he wants to finish this quickly and take the cup home. Charlie. Oh shit. That's a bit of a false start for this agility. What's going on there? Probably because of the food. Well, looks like he entertains the audience and the judges in a different way. Hello, listen.. What the hell is going on? You can't take care of your dog. Not only that, our time is also wasted. Sir, we really came here.. -Oh, really? Do you even understand why you are standing here? Are you joking? That's what they think. What was the name? Charlie. Charlie. Chaplain. A good harmony. In my 13 years of experience, I have never seen anything like this. After ruining the show. Oh, you seem to understand it more than you do. Shut up! Eats, circles, sleeps. Don't you know any other work apart from these three? Never show your face again. Stay with me..
