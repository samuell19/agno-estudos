- We thought of you with love today but that is nothing new. We thought about you yesterday and days before that too. We think of you in silence, we often speak your name. Now all we have are memories and your picture in a frame. Your memory is our keepsake with which we'll never part. God has you in his keeping, we have you in our heart. - [Voiceover] There was this boom, people just started crying and I was trying to get out the door and I had a dead person on me. - [Voiceover] Nearly 70 members of a church youth group that was heading home-- - [Voiceover] 27 were killed when their church bus was hit head on on I 71. To this day the Carol County bus wreck is the worse drunken driving accident in US history. - [Voiceover] No more trials, no more heartaches, no more tears. - [Voiceover] I want you to know that I really am sorry. I know it's not gonna make you feel any different toward me and I would probably feel the same way that you feel about it. - [Voiceover] It's really tragic, sometimes it makes you appreciate life that you still have it. Maybe have an opportunity to enjoy more with your children. - [Voiceover] The state police routine have blood sampled for alcohol whenever there's a crime. - [Voiceover] A prayer service is underway at this hour for the families who lost loved ones. - [Voiceover] They couldn't get out once the bus exploded in fire. - [Voiceover] That's the first thing my children started doing is our bible, Mama, not Bobby, not Dale, not Christy, not Amy, not any of these, they named 'em all. - I would love for people to think that time is the great healer and the pain goes away. (crashing and screaming) But you never get over the loss. - I was very happily married to my childhood sweetheart, John Pearman, and we were attending the church there in Radcliff, Radcliff First Assembly of God church, and we were very involved. John was one of the associate pastors so he wore many hats sharing that job and this was the day he was going with the youth to Kings Island and he would be driving the bus. We woke up very early that morning. He and Christy were just rushing around the house, very excited to be going on the trip. - That morning I can remember leaving with my dad in the car and I remember my brother had gotten up and he was 11, he didn't wanna go that year for some reason so my mom stayed behind. Initially she had always helped chaperone with my dad and this year she's like I'll just keep your brother at home. - And I remember rushing them out and saying you're gonna be late, you better get on over there and get the trip started, get everything ready to go. And I just remember kissing John goodbye, open the sliding glass door to tell them goodbye for the day. - Well Kristen had just turned 14 and Robin was 10. They were my only two children. Kristen was a unique little girl. She liked to draw, she liked to write, she liked music, she loved the piano, she liked band. She'd write me a letter at night and she'd put that letter in my hat before I'd go to work over at the base and she wanted me to read that letter and respond. Robin, completely different. 10 year old, wanted to play softball, sports. And just two totally different kids but they were my kids and quite honestly they were my life. - Andy was a year older than me, a grade older. But we were all tight, we all had a really close friendship. Andy in particular. I think we just had a lot in common, we were both athletes, both loved sports, into music and break dancing and stuff back then. - Patty was an incredible young girl, she was of course our first born and she was very smart, she was a straight A student, she was really the kid you hated in school, she always did her work on time, handed it in, was kinda like the teacher's pet. When Patty was born and as she grew she looked so much like my husband Jim I thought well if anything ever happens to Jim, I will always have Patty. Little did I know it would be the reverse. - Joy and I met in high school. She was in the 10th grade and I was a senior. She was really the only girl I ever was interested in and we began to date. - At the time I had a big crush on Wayne and he was my guest there that day. - Christy invited me to go on a church trip, it was gonna be a day away and kind of it became the thing to do, there was a big group obviously of kids our age going on the trip. So yeah, very excited to go on the trip, to be tagging along with Christy, and obviously a little puppy love made that even more exciting for me. - My friend Emily Thompson invited me. We weren't, I would say, super close friends, but we talked in school, that sort of thing and so I was a bit surprised when she asked me to go to Kings Island, I was excited 'cause we had never done anything outside of school before so I was really looking forward to the trip. Thought it was gonna be a lot of fun. - And I'm not quite sure how it happened but Robin was talking to her mother, my wife Joy, she thought well you know there are no ladies on board, you still have the associate pastor which was John who was driving and you had the minister of music slash youth leader which was Chuck Hytta and so Joy basically went and volunteered to go along as a chaperone. - When I saw all of the kids get on and I saw the bus was getting crowded, I was still very nervous. - We boarded the bus, Chuck Hytta said, kinda told us about the day and said a prayer, kind of blessed, just being thankful for the day and the opportunity to be together and to go up that day. - And then everybody started introducing themselves and Joy, my friend, she said oh Janie, we're gonna have a great time, you're gonna be Patty Nunnallee's more or less mother for the day and Joy was gonna be the mother for the two of her children. So the instant that I met Patty Nunnallee I fell in love with her because she was exactly had the personality of my granddaughter so we got along well. It was just a beautiful May day, that entire day, just a gorgeous day. - It was the place to be. I mean there's no question that if you weren't going to Kings Island with the First Assembly of God this day you weren't cool I guess which is why I pressed so hard for my mom to allow me to go but we were all excited. - I thought what could be safer than a bus, and so knowing Joy was gonna be there as a chaperone and she and Patty and Jill would be together as 10 year olds, my husband and I both agreed that she should go, so she was allowed to go on the trip. - I love roller coasters so we rode a lot of roller coasters, stood in line, did all the things. - I think the whole day Wayne was actually trying to win me a teddy bear or something. - The day was great. We did the typical things you do at Kings Island, the rides, the Beast, the twin racers, the funnel cakes, you know chasing little girls around. - I just remember that it was a lot of fun, I remember it was really crowded. I do remember riding one roller coaster, we rode backwards and I felt pretty sick after doing that. - You know you have money so you wanna spend it, you don't wanna go home with no money and so I got off the bus and I went and I got this humongous balloon, helium balloon. - We get to the bus and we took the seats available which on the way down we sat further toward the back. But we didn't get to get to a back seat because they were taken so it obviously didn't dawn on me at the time. Our fate that night was determined by where we sat. - And we were talking to everybody and really tired. At one point we're sitting in the seat and he leaned over and he did kiss me. Not much longer after that the lights on the bus went on. - I was scared to death of John Pearman. He was the nicest guy ever, he obviously had a great reputation but I'm an eighth grade boy and he had made it pretty clear that he was gonna protect his daughter so he kinda gave me the evil eye, I think. In a loving sort of way. - We started the journey home and I was asleep. - The windows were down and the balloon was starting to just fly in the air so I got the balloon and I put it on my legs like a pillow and I laid down on it. - We did make a stop on the way home, we stopped at a gas station. - When I went in the gas station, the first person I met was my dad and he came up to me and he kinda grabbed me, he said I'm keeping my eye on you and that little boy in the back and I was like oh Dad and so he kinda grabbed me and gave me a noogie on the head and I just kinda was jerking away from him, I went I love you Dad, and I just ran back on the bus. And that was the last time I saw my dad. - Peaceful ride home from Kings Island amusement park. The kids and their chaperones had just had a terrific day. Now on the way home some were already reminiscing, others were sleeping, but no one dreamed that they'd cross paths with a truck going the wrong way. - Eventually there's like a loud crash or a boom. (crashes) I hit the seat in front of me and I remember thinking, what in the world just happened? - And it threw me out of my seat right into the aisle so it ended up that I was sitting on the floor facing the back of the bus and I had to brace myself with my hands behind me because we were skidding and the right front of the bus was tilted downwards. (screaming) - I thought it was all a dream at first. Once I realized what was going on and was trying to get out, the aisles were already packed. I had to climb over the seats. - I did hear the burst of flames. I actually watched the skin on my left hand shrivel up, not knowing that my right hand was as bad as it was. - It all happened very very very fast. Very quickly, very chaotically. (horn sounding) (explosion) - I could see the white light towards the back of the doors and I figured that was the way out. So I just started climbing in that direction. - I turn and step on the back of the seat, see an opening at the back of the bus and the exit door. There was only about a foot or two opening by that time, kids were already piling up almost to the top of that. - If you didn't react instantly, you weren't gonna make it. - I started screaming for my mom, I mean screaming, wailing, you couldn't see in front of you. So I'm pushing everybody trying to get out. Just constantly screaming and then for some reason in my mind I thought I was gonna die. I just knew this was it. - I didn't know what I was doing, I went toward the front and that's right where the fire was, the gas tank was a few rows in front of me on the opposite side of the bus, so I turned around and I tried to get out of a window. The old style buses where you had to pull these two clasps together simultaneously to get these windows down. - My head hit the seat in front of me and I woke up and I stood up and when I stood up all I seen was. (explosion and screaming) (dramatic music) - All I could see was flames, they were getting higher and higher and I could see John Pearman, he was the driver of the bus, I could see him kind of slumped over the steering wheel and I could see the fire. He was like a silhouette in the orange and the yellow flames and the next thing I knew I was on the ground outside the bus and so I thought I've got to look back and I looked back and my seat that I came out of the window was engulfed in flames. (explosion and screaming) - It was a death trap. So if you could imagine, the only lights you had are flames. - And I remember feeling the heat and the glow of the fire and just hearing a bunch of people yell get out get out get out. - Just this huge whoosh and I knew the bus was on fire, I could feel the heat behind me. I could see sort of the orange glow and the only thing that kept running in my head was I can't believe this is happening to me and don't turn around. - I can hear people screaming for mommy, everyone's jumbled on top of each other, and I was four seats from the back so I can kinda remember being thrust down into the seat and feeling like people were just on top of me. - I was standing up so I inhaled all the smoke and eventually passed out. - It was just so hot on your throat, just really, really suffocating. - 60 plus people all going to the same opening. (screaming) - The helium of course it blew up and that was what caught me on fire was the balloon. - Something in me just started building and I just got mad and I just kept thinking no, I am not going to die on this bus, I am not. Somehow I just put my hands up on the seat back of the seat that I was crouched down in and I just used it like a pullup and I pulled my body up and I just fell over to the next seat. - I climbed seat after seat after seat. I fought people, I fought bodies, I fought everything I could to get to the back. - And the seat was literally so hot to the touch that it had literally melted the skin right off my palm. - I looked over to my right and it sort of illuminated, I happened to notice Anthony Marks. He was sort of standing with his back against the window and just looking at the front of the bus in horror. - I remembered that being so hot, getting out of the seat and finding myself in an aisleway and turning towards the front to just yell for my dad. Dad, Dad, Dad! (sirens wailing) - I feel this pull. The next thing I know I'm hitting the ground. - Before I knew it I was out on the pavement making my way over to the grassy median. And then looking back at the bus and just trying to figure out where everybody was. - And I'll never forget it the rest of my life 'cause I turned back around after everybody had gotten out it seemed like everybody was over attending to all the burn victims and I turned around I saw the back of the bus, I looked over my shoulder, I said Cheryl, somebody's just dropped out of the back of the bus on the asphalt. So me and her ran over there and I said now Cheryl, you grab this person's legs, I'll grab her hands, and we'll carry her over to the grass median with the rest of the burn victims. At the time I didn't know if it was a boy or a girl. - I see my friend David. He was crying and telling me he was falling to pieces. And I looked at him, he was holding his arms out and his skin was coming off his arms. - I don't remember any of my friends or Christy being anywhere even within sight. I just remember seeing bodies toward the back of the bus and kinda that mass of people getting off and trying to help others off. - Somebody grabs ahold of me, catches up with me and they lay me down in the median. The blades of grass in the median feeling like knives sticking me in the back of my arm, but I do remember somebody coming over to me and saying your sister's okay, Kim is okay, Kim got out. - It ended up being Carey Aurentz but her hair was gone, she was severely burned, of course she had black soot all over so I couldn't tell who it was so I said let's carry 'em over there, you grab her legs, I'll grab her hands, we'll carry her over. - The paramedics came over and was talking to me and told me exactly what was gonna happen, that they were gonna pick me up on three and they were gonna put me on the stretcher and when they slid me into the ambulance they put me beside a medicine cabinet type thing that had reflection and I remember looking to the side and all I could see was this big black circle. But I couldn't see anything else. It just looked like this big black thing of trash, and it was my face. - I bent down, grabbed Carey's arms, Cheryl bent down and grabbed her legs, and all of a sudden she dropped her because she said Jason, I can't do it. I said Cheryl, just grab her legs real quick and we'll carry her over there. She said no, you don't understand, her legs are too hot. So I cradled Carey in my arms and took her over to the grass median. So at 13 years of age, to witness something like that was really devastating to me. - [Steve] Good evening everyone, I'm Steve Bergin. - And I'm Vicki Dortch. It's the worst bus accident in Kentucky history. At first there were reports that 18 were dead, but after authorities began removing bodies from the bus, that figure was changed. It now stands at 27. - The phone rang, I believe it was somewhere around 11 or a little after 11. And when the phone rang you know to this day I don't know who called. It was somebody from the sheriff's saying Lee, the bus has been involved in an accident. - When my mom and dad came back to the house, it was sometime in the later morning. They sat us down on the couch, my brothers and I, and they told us that there had been an accident. And that my sister didn't make it. - So I was in Florida at the time of the crash. And Jim, my husband, was in charge of our two daughters and I talked to him on Saturday night and life was good. When I talked to him, I said how are things going? And he said well Patty had spent the night with the Williams the night before and that they'd gone to Kings Island and they were expected to be home late. - Well you know this is a big bus. Fender bender. Somebody ran into them at a stoplight or something. But I just said this is not right, something's not right. So I got up and got dressed and I went over to the church. And when I got over to the church I knew something was terribly wrong. - And when I walked into my home, my dad was sitting there and when I looked at his face, I thought immediately that my mother must have died. I knew something horrible had happened. And my father in law stood up and said Carolyn, there's been an accident, and I thought immediately being a military wife we are trained, we have seminars on the loss of our husbands, so immediately I thought it had to be Jim. And in the next word he said Patty. - She and I shared a room and we went to bed and said good night, I love you, and she was leaving early in the morning before I would have woken up so that was the last time that I got to talk to her. In my head I can remember thinking about all the times that we played together and how she took care of us and just being worried that she wasn't gonna be there to kinda look after me and my younger brother. - By that time parents were beginning to arrive at the church, thinking they were gonna be taking their teenagers home from the trip. But as the news reports came in from the state police and they were calling the pastor there at the church telling them that there had been a really bad crash out on the interstate. - And about that time the phone rang and it was my husband Jim and to this day he doesn't remember calling me. This phone call. But he said Carolyn, where are Patty's dental records? And I told him where they were. They were at the Fort Knox dental clinic. And I asked him why and he just hung up the phone. - There are 17 people still in area hospitals, seven of those are here at Humana Hospital U of L, nine are at Kosair Children's a few blocks away, one teenager is at St. Mary and Elizabeth Hospital. And of the 17 who are still hospitalized, more than half of those are in critical condition. - There were so many lists of children's names at the hospitals, at the church, just different list of the children's names, everywhere, and so they said just go to the hospitals and pray and hope that your child is listed on one of the lists that they would have there. - All that night that's the way it was. I would go home, nothing. I'd sit out in the parking lot and I would just say God, would you spare all three of my family? Don't let nothing happen to Joy, Kristen, or Robin. God, I'm just gonna believe that they're gonna be okay and then I began to hear who had died. Began to hear stories about 4 o'clock in the morning. If you've not heard from your family, chances are you may not. Boy I tell you what I do remember that night I quit praying and I began to bargain with God. God, will you spare at least two. And I didn't say which two. At about 6 o'clock in the morning I was so desperate, you know, it's amazing what you'll say when you're desperate. I said God I don't wanna be left alone. If I have to lose one or two, you just leave me somebody. I'm begging you. You go from prayer to bargain to begging. (helicopter chopping) - It was heartwrenching. Parents did not start arriving until about 3 or 3:30 in the morning at which point in time you see just the anguish in their eyes, their eyes diverting in every direction looking for any type of familiarity. You could just see their hearts in their hands looking for their children, giving the names of these children and we didn't know the names of these children. - Norton's was the first one that we went to and Christy Pearman's name was on the list there as a survivor. John's name I could not find anywhere, could not find him located in any of the hospitals and a chaplain came right away to me and told me that the bus driver had been killed and he knew he was my husband. - The child I hold most dear in my heart from that entire experience is the young man who first came to our emergency room. He was in such a state of shock, in such a state of despair that he could not get his sister out of his mind. He lingered and lingered and lingered and we couldn't answer his question. I need my sister. The next day in the paper as I read about the fatalities it turns out that this young man's sister passed away. - [Voiceover] No more trials, no more heartaches, no more tears. And they're there enjoying life in the fullest beyond even what you and I can really comprehend. - [Voiceover] Lord we know that the throne room of heaven is paying attention, and Lord we just ask for peace tonight for every family member, for every friend. Lord we just ask that it'll flow through our entire spirit tonight. - Remember all the signs all around town, every business had signs out expressing their sympathy and condolences and the signs seemed to stay up forever, I remember that. - Radcliff came together in unity as a community and they were unified. That's what America does, it comes together. 9/11, whenever tragedy hits, a hurricane, America comes together and I'll tell you I felt the power and the support of the community, I really did. - I knew a lot of the children because they were my children's friends, I knew some of the children because they were kids who went to North Hardin and I saw them in the cafeteria because I worked there. - One of the hardest things of my life though was being a pallbearer at my best friend's funeral, Chad's. - Chad was the manager of their basketball team and the family asked the team to be the pallbearers. - The mayor was a member of our church and I was a leader of the ministral association. And so he was the one that asked me to bring the message at the memorial service. It was a very emotional service, crying from beginning to end. The people in the stands, the people standing, the people in chairs, 5,000 plus people there. It was a very moving thing for our whole community. (sirens wailing) - Well it was so unreal, so surreal that I really didn't know what I was looking at. When I arrived I parked about 12, 1500 feet away from the crash. It was hard to see, medical helicopters still lifting off. (helicopters chopping) There was news helicopters overhead, traffic was stopped. There was many victims laying in the medians, people were getting ice from coolers in nearby cars and buses, tending to the victims, laying them out before emergency response could arrive. 11 ambulances were used, two emergency medical helicopters were utilized, four hospitals were utilized. - So I arrived in Carroltton after midnight, sought out the state police to show me to Coroner Dunn. Met Jack at the back of the bus, the back door was open. There were no living victims at that point in the scene. Had a (mumbles) light and with both hands used that to pull away as much as I could. So a scene of absolute horror. Dead kids draped over the backs of seats, their bodies either completely or partially incinerated. - We started having parents coming to the scene of the crash. I remember looking at this gentleman and he says, I said you're gonna have to get back. He said can you tell where the guy is that's driving that black pickup truck? I said I don't know, I think he's gone to the hospital. And then I remember the gentleman saying, my son was on that bus and I wanna go kill that son of a bitch. I remember going to sit on the guard rail and try and collect my thoughts and look at my notes and at that particular time it appeared to be that it was eerily quiet out there on the interstate. - I went to my car, I sat down. Thought for about five minutes as to what we should do. At that point I went back to the back of the bus, said well we have to assemble a team, we have to move the scene. - The decision was made to not remove any bodies on the interstate because we had so many bystanders, we had so many news media around that we simply didn't want to cause a parade of victims. The bus, with victims still inside, was placed on a trailer, it was trucked inside the National Guard armory where we could work in private, conduct an independent, a secure investigation. At that particular time, the families that were involved were vanned to the Holiday Inn in Carroltton which was just slightly down the road and across the street from there and we started getting as much information as you could. Red Cross was called in to assist. The families were interviewed in terms of victim data. Color hair, what kind of clothing they had on, how old. - I knew that standing in the middle of the temporary morgue that I probably couldn't do this job for the rest of my life. - [Voiceover] Even seasoned police officers were shaken by what they witnessed inside the morgue as the death toll continued to mount during the afternoon. - Well it's a horrible task for anyone who cares anything about a human life. Especially in the cases like this when so many lives are snuffed out. - The picture that they want to keep of their children is not what is in that room, but what is in their wallets and in their minds. - I've never, thank you, experienced anything similar to Carroltton before or after and I don't care to. - We know that from the time they hit til the time that the bus comes to a final rest, it took 1.94 seconds. That church bus is already on fire. Mahoney hits the right front of the bus, spins out about 80 feet to the left. He survives the crash with moderate injuries. The children, the passengers on the bus begin to start unloading out the back of the bus as quickly as they can. The matter of time for the occupants to get out was in seconds. They had burns on the palms of their hands from the polyvinyl covering on the seats melting on their hands. They had burns on the tops of their ears, backs of their ears, top of their head from the paint dripping off the ceiling. So it became very hot, very quickly, inside that bus. The ones that survived were the fortunate ones to be in the rear or the bigger, stronger males that were inside the bus. We shut the interstate down and did a replication of how the collision occurred based on the physical evidence that I gathered. Each vehicle was traveling approximately 55 miles an hour. That means they had about two and a half seconds between themselves to do something. (mumbles) Brakes, steers to the left, and the collision occurs, so we know that Mr. Pearman had about three quarters of a second to do something prior to this crash. Simply didn't have the time or the distance to avoid what occurred. (crashes) - Well he'd been drinking, you could tell that. He wasn't feeling any pain, but I wouldn't have thought he'd been drunk enough to have got on the interstate. - Larry grew up here on the peaceful banks of the Kentucky River. This is where he likes to hunt and fish. Everyone that we've talked to that knows him says that he's a quiet, likable man, the son of good, Christian parents. - He was a hard worker, he was a good person. He (mumbles), he went out of his way to help you when you asked for his help. - This afternoon a complaint has been filed in the Carol district court charging Larry Mahoney with 27 counts of capital murder. Arrest warrant has been issued, the officer is at the hospital arresting Mr. Mahoney at this time. - We could account for Larry Mahoney's whereabouts all but about 15 minutes of that time. We knew where he had been, drinking alcohol, we knew that he had the option to leave his house, leave the house where he was at and travel to his residence. The people that he was with took his keys away from him and only told him that they would give him back if he promised to drive straight home. Instead he turns left, he gets out on the two-lane roadway, we know that he stops and buys more alcohol. He then originally continued south in the southbound lanes and then all of a sudden he comes north in the southbound lanes. He was on the wrong side of the road for at least two and 3/10 miles. And in that two and 3/10 miles with him traveling north in the southbound lanes, this is a four lane highway, two going in each direction. Heavy traffic, Saturday night. We know that in that two and 3/10 miles, he passed or missed if you will, 14 vehicles, two of which were tractor trailers. Two witnesses that were extremely important to our investigation were Jack and Joan Armstrong. They're traveling north in the northbound lanes, they're at about the 37 mile marker on northbound I-71. It's that particular point that Mr. Armstrong looks over in the southbound lane and says, quote, "I see the shiny little black pickup truck "going the wrong way." Mr. Armstrong and his wife travel behind Mr. Mahoney and they described it to me. They thought he hit a gasoline tanker truck. - I was burnt about 67% of my body, all third degree. My right hand was burnt to the bone. My fingers, the tendons, everything were gone. My vocal cords sustained a lot of heat damage and I had to have a trachostomy for about a year and a half and 14 surgeries alone on my voice box and my vocal cords. - For burn victims the treatment for burns is almost as bad if not worse than the actual injury itself. The treatment was very, very painful. One of my early memories is going to the debridement process where preparing your skin to be grafted. They would take these white gauzes and they would soak them in a saline solution and they'd literally wrap them on my burns on my face and they would let these gauzes dry and then they would come and they would peel them off to peel off the debris and the dead skin and the scabs or whatever. Crying was a daily thing. Dreading anybody walking in my door that wasn't family. - They took me to surgery that very first day, I guess it would have been May 15th, trying to see what to do about my leg 'cause it was, like I said, very badly burned and it actually wasn't until 12 days later, May 26th, that they actually decided that they were gonna have to amputate. - Christy was burned from her arms down to her fingertips. She had suffered a lot of facial injuries with the burns. And she had suffered these injuries because she stayed on the bus so long, she was in the back of the bus, but she knew that her dad was up front and so she stayed on as long as she could, thinking her dad was still alive and screaming for her dad. - And I remember saying to them, well I wanna see it. You're gonna take my leg off, you're gonna take my foot, I need to see it. And they're like you really don't wanna see it. And I'm like I want to see it. And so a couple of the nurses sort of sat me up in the bed and I looked down at it and I just thought oh my God, how in the world did they think they were gonna save this? - My mom had brought a VHS tape, a video of one of the memorial services that had gone on in Radcliff and I remember sitting on the edge of my bed in the burn unit watching this video. It was just unbelievable. - I don't know, I wasn't feeling, I don't think I was feeling anything, just trying to survive, trying to be there for him and let him know that I was there. - My mom was so reluctant to tell me anything so I just knew, I just knew that something wasn't right with Andy. - I would just change the subject. The doctors had said not to tell him right away about what had happened to the 27 people. - She always had a smile on her face, always, all bandaged up as she was and as severely burned as she was. She would smile but she would say Mom, hi Mom, where is Dad? And of course she couldn't talk plain and my heart would just break every day. - When am I gonna get to see myself? 'Cause I knew, I obviously knew my face was burned, knew that. I didn't know how bad. - Harold every day would ask for a mirror or whatever and they didn't think that he was ready to see himself. So I guess all the nurses knew not to give him a mirror or whatever but I had gone for a cup of coffee one morning. - I convinced a nurse one day, give me a little handheld mirror when my mom was out of the room. - I could hear, I knew right away that he had gotten hold of a mirror. He was just devastated, he was screaming and very very very upset. - I didn't recognize the person looking back at me. (mirror breaks) - Then I was asking the nurse you know where's my mom, where's my dad, what happened, where's this person, and that's when I got the news. - I was going to her room that day and when I walked off the elevator the nurse met me when I came off the elevator and she said good morning Mrs. Pearman, Christy is very alert and very awake this morning, and she has a lot of questions for you. - And my mom walked through the door, and I said where's Dad, where's Dad? - And so I did tell her, Christy, Dad did not make it. The wreck was so bad and Dad died on the bus, along with a lot of your friends. - And then I started just going down the list. What about Cynthia? What about Kashawn? What about Shannon? What about Amy? And at that point Mom just started naming all the people that had died and it was surreal. I lost a dad, I lost a cousin, and I lost 13 friends that day. - And she started crying and we just fell into each other's arms and just sobbed and sobbed. - I had to wear this mask, I had a pressure garment called a Jobst garment. And I had two of them, I had a mask I would wear that would Velcro all the way down the back. Had holes for my eyes, nose, mouth. Supposed to wear it 24/7. And I had a jacket that I would wear for my skin grafts on my shoulder and back. - They called me Freddy Kruger. That was back when Freddy Kruger was big, Nightmare on Elm Street. And the biggest was crispy critter, I was the crispy critter. I was a nerd before the wreck and then I was a monster after the wreck. - So I got rid of the mask. Came home, told my mom I'm not wearing it. I'll try to sleep in it. She would tell me medically, bub, you need to wear it. Doctors are telling you to wear it. I was hard-headed I guess. - You'll hear people say wow, sometimes I wish that my emotional scars were visible because then people could truly understand what I've been through. Well what I would suggest is that you probably need to be careful what you wish for, that actually the visible scars do add another layer of complexity to people's lives because you don't have the opportunity to decide when and if you're going to share the story with somebody, your story's literally written on your body for other people to see. And so every time somebody sees that mark or scar on you, even if it's a look or if it is as direct as a question, you're being forced to confront the memories of what happened to you. - When we came back from Patty's funeral, there were a number of calls on our phone, and they were from a certain group of attorneys that were representing a lot of the families and there was just this urgent need to sign on the dotted line, that there was gonna be a class action suit and I didn't really understand it at that time because I was dealing with the loss of my child. - I don't know that Ford Company would be to blame. I would rather think that alcohol and the sale of it and the distribution of it would be a big factor. - As a former educator, I thought that school buses were the safest mode of transportation on the roads. We don't have an option of which bus we're gonna put our children on, so I just knew they had to be safe. What we found out after the crash was that school buses were not safe. - It's horrendous that people died from flame injury and from smoke inhalation that were not incapacitated in any other way physically. - I highly respected their wanting to really know what went on. The crash occurred, but it was a needless occurrence of a fuel-fed fire that was the defective, unsafe, terrible design of the school bus, particularly the exposed fuel tank with no protection at all that led to the fiery tragedy that occurred. - There are two issues here, and we never have been able to separate the two issues. There was the drunk driver who caused the crash. There was the unsafe bus, which if the bus had been safe, none of the children would have died in that crash. - We had no reason to believe that the location was anything except a safe location and that the ICC tank was anything except a safe tank. - This is the standard 60 gallon fuel tank and it's totally unprotected, there's no structure around it to help protect it in a crash situation, and here on the main frame rail you see the six bolt holes where Ford normally would put the steel protective cage that goes all around the tank. But because that wasn't required by law until April of 1977 and the Carroltton accident bus was built just eight days earlier, Ford elected not to put the safety protective cage around the fuel tank. - I did see the school bus where it had been punctured by the suspension system that came off, and I saw photos of the children stacked up in the bus. - I never had any intention to suing anybody. You know, I personally don't believe and still don't believe to this day it was Ford's fault. Other people made the bus. It was a drunk driver, alcohol. That was as safe a bus as was on the road at the time. - We had to fight the industry to make things safer. We chose not to go with the company that represented most of the families. And at first we were ostracized because we didn't join the group, we were I felt at times like a leper, but we made the choice that we felt was best for us. No amount of money's gonna bring my daughter back. But these burn victims are gonna have to have lifelong, you know they may have more surgeries, I just kept thinking about there's no amount of money that you can give them. - I remember my parents saying that they took the settlement because it would help me pay for medical bills, we didn't know what the outcome of my injuries long-term were going to be, how much medical care I would need in the future. - I don't blame any of the parents for settling versus not, the reality is for my family, we didn't have anything at that time, my mom didn't, she was a single mom taking care of two kids so do I blame her for settling and receiving money? No. - I've always seen it as blood money. It has helped with the surgeries that I've been through, and it has helped with the recovery process and it has helped me have a better life, but in no way does it replace what I went through and what I lost. - We just knew that when we sat down that no amount of money would bring Patty back. And so we told Ford Motor Company, rather than take the settlement offered, that we would take a dollar if they would recall all of these pre '72 buses and retrofit them with cages around the gas tanks and larger safety windows, escape routes. And they turned us down. And that's when we decided we were not settling. - This was a terrible collision accident caused by a drunk driver, but it was also a tragedy because an unsafe school bus converted what would have been a survivable crash for all of the children and adults on that bus, they all would have walked off that bus and not have perished but for the unsafe design of the school bus. - How could somebody do this? How could anybody drink and drive? But he did. He made a wrong choice that night. A lot of wrong choices. - Extreme anger. I was just so mad that one person could have caused all this devastation. - I'm trying to wake up the next day and just gain the strength to accept what happened to me and Andy and Chad and Amy and Phillip and everybody else. But the more I began to understand that they're not coming back and I'm not changing, I began to hate him. - I didn't even know this man's name at the time, but I knew I hated him. And I didn't hate him just for us, I hated him for all the children that were killed, the adults that were killed, and all of those children that lives were forever changed. I hated him. - When I got to the trial I saw this big outline of the bus, I saw where the people were sitting. And they came up to me and held up a picture, said who is this? And I said that is my wife, Joy Williams. How old is she? 34. He goes places the picture where she was sitting on the bus. Held up a picture of my 14 year old, I had to identify her, a picture of my 10 year old. - [Voiceover] I won't use the word hate, but I was angry at Mr. Mahoney. - No sir, all three of my family members were killed on that bus on May 14th. - [Voiceover] Did you have any other surviving family members? - No sir I do not. - He just was such a nice person, he would do anything in the world for anybody. And even if the person did him wrong, he didn't hold a grudge against that person, he still would help them in any way he could. If there was any way possible that he could have avoided that buss, he would've and he would've took his own life to do it. (shouting) - To me, he made a terrible choice. There is no way around that. He made a horrible, horrible choice. And no one should ever get behind the wheel of a car impaired. - I thought about my own father, I've seen my dad drink and drive, he's had couple of accidents hisself. The first thing I thought, that could have been my dad. He didn't get up that day and say I'm a go do this, and that's what stuck out with me with Larry Mahoney. - Somebody had done this and had caused this much damage and I remember during the dressing changes which were extremely painful thinking Mahoney should be burned, and he should have to come in here and have to do dressing changes and I want him to feel the pain, they should cut off his leg too and I didn't want him to die because I wanted him to suffer. - There were friends of mine that would say oh if I had a chance I would kill him because he killed our friends. - Their defense was that the bus that was provided by First Assembly of God church, they described it as a rolling tin can with a bomb under it. Mr. Mahoney's comments was I didn't mean to do it, I did not know the bus was gonna catch on fire. Had nothing to do with the fact of driving the wrong way on the interstate and those type of things. - If it had happened in Radcliff where the victims were primarily from, the trial could have been a totally different result. But it happened in a neighboring county where people realized that he wasn't the drunken wanton hellraising redneck that he'd been portrayed as, he was a quiet, hardworking guy. There's a tendency from the public to want to have a villain to blame. There was 27 people killed and 24 of them were children, and on top of that they were at a church outing. So the natural reaction of people was we need to blame somebody and somebody's gotta pay. As we soon learned, none of the victims in this case died as a result of trauma from the collision, they all died from basically breathing toxic smoke from the seats and the seat covers burning, and it became very apparent very quickly that there was a huge issue regarding the condition of the bus and what role that played in this accident. - I remember the prosecutor asked if the defense had any questions and I sort of swiveled around in my chair and looked and I saw him for the first time and Mahoney was just sort of staring down at the table and I was thinking are you listening? Are you hearing what's going on here? Like was mad like why aren't you listening to what's going on? - People from all walks of life, sadly enough, have driven while they're drunk before. I mean you have judges get convicted, police officers get convicted, doctors, politicians, so there's so many people that have done what Larry did, whether they be on a jury or if they're not on a jury everybody on a jury knows somebody that has driven drunk. - The attorney asked us, the state attorney asked us if we wanted to sentence him, what would it be? And I said well number one I wanted life in prison. I wanted him to have to go to Florida to lay asphalt in July so he could have some sense of what these children went through that night. I want him to understand heat and fire and just let him know and I wanted him to never ever be able to drive a car again. - I know that y'all been wanting me to say something and tell you I'm sorry, and that's what I've been wanting to do, but I've been told not to say anything. So I want you to know that I really am sorry. - He was given 10 years for the ones that were critically injured, the assault first cases. He was getting five years on a manslaughter charge for the ones that were killed. He was given one year each for the wanton endangerment charges and those sentences were run consecutive. Disappointing, obviously. - I wrote him a letter and it stayed on my dresser for a long time after I wrote it and then one day I mailed it. I told him how I felt towards him and how when I seen him at the trial, how my heart was torn because there's so much hatred towards him that I could not hate him. It was not in me, it's not who I am and that I forgave him. And then at the end I put PS, my name is Ciaran Madden, I was in the Carroltton bus wreck. - He wrote that he couldn't believe his eyes that he was reading this letter, that there was another person out there that didn't hate him. It was a short and sweet letter coming back. But then we just started writing back and forth. He walked up to the table and he just looked at me and I asked him if I could give him a hug and he said I was gonna ask you first and he gave me a hug and it was like he just collapsed. Someone asked me that night what was he like, and I said he was a country boy that made a mistake. - He was a model prisoner, he served his sentence. Would I like to sit down with him? I would like to sit down with him. I know he will never, ever remember the crash. He was drunk that night. He's not gonna remember, nothing I do can make him remember, but I would just like him to probably know me and know Patty as well as the others that were with her that night. - When I'm not able to wear my prosthesis and get around as I would consider normal, I get mad. Those feelings of anger return because I am reminded why I am not walking at this particular moment, and I do get mad. And I think that doesn't seem very evolved and very whatever, but I don't know, I don't care. It's being honest, I do still get mad. - I also realize that I was allowing him to kill me. And if I held this hate and animosity toward him, he would kill me just as he killed my child. And that's when in church they talk about forgiveness, and at that time I equated forgiveness with forgetting, and it's not the same. Forgiveness means holding no animosity, holding no malice. And I forgave him. - I don't hate him, 'cause I don't have time to consume myself with that. Whether I hate him or if he sat in a prison cell for 30 years instead of 10. Doesn't change anything. - I think it'd be very natural to question God and get angry at God and not understand and that's part of the accident. Not only numbness and shock but initially you begin to question and you'll get very angry at God I would think and that you would wanna tell God in your own terms what you thought about the whole situation, how unfair this would be. That was a dark time for us in Radcliff. You don't question in the dark what you've learned in the light. - I couldn't understand it, I thought he wasn't listening because we prayed and that was God's job to listen when people pray, how dare you not listen. - The nurses were like wow, angels carried you off the bus, God had a purpose for you to live and I remember thinking no, I got myself off the bus, I'm the one that did it. Nobody carried me off that bus, nobody helped pull me off that bus, I made it out of that bus. I resented that. Why would God pick me over Emily? Why would God pick me over these 27 people? Their lives were not any less important than my own. - People sort of carry some basic fundamental assumptions with them just to get through day to day life. Some of those assumptions are that the world is controllable and that things are predictable. - Oh yeah, I had plenty of nightmares. Always had one in particular that (screaming) that really bugged me for years. I remember us being on a bus, me actually getting to the aisle, aisleway, but (mumbles) and being covered with bodies, being buried in there pretty much and trapped. And not making it out. I always see this one face, it's always this girl, it's a blond-haired girl. Just falling on top of me. And like I said, she's already gone when I do see her. - I struggled with post traumatic stress disorder and some depression on and off. It wasn't actually until seven years after the crash that I was actually diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder. - I woke up one morning and I thought I was having a heart attack. I was 29 years old and I became very, very sick. I became almost bedridden. I had to move back in with my parents. And they packaged me up and sent me to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. It's an incredible place and I hope you never have to go. But at the end of the week they'd give you a diagnosis, and I said can you tell me what's wrong with me? He said sure. You need to find yourself a new job. And he diagnosed me with post traumatic stress syndrome. Finally started getting a little better. Wasn't gonna find a new job because being a state trooper is what a loved. Took me about 16 months to get over it. - I had a lot of depression just thinking that she should be alive and not me. - The just world belief is that good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people. When bad things happen to a person and they ask why, people are then trying to find an answer to what they did. - I did pray one time that I wish God would let me see Kristen, Robin, and Joy, in fact it was that night. I said God I'm just gonna close my eyes and when I open 'em I said you can do this. Can I just see Joy, Kristen, and Robin one minute? That's all I want. I said to God I just wanna tell them that I love them one more time. Just hold my little 10 year old one more time. Kiss my wife one more time, just put my arms around my 14 year old, that's all I wanted. I prayed a great prayer, when I opened my eyes, there was nothing there. I just said God, they're with you, all I want is some little time. - You never get over the loss of someone you love. And the strangest things will bring back memories of that loved one. But I also know that if I hadn't loved so deeply, it would not hurt at all. - I'm gonna make my family proud of me. My family would have wanted me to serve God. My family would have said put your life back together, no one's coming back. - I'm tired of going to the cemetery, I'm tired of looking at pictures. It was near New Year's and I thought, you know, there's gonna be a new year and there's gonna be a new Lee. - Well I had known Lee at our church, our church was a fairly large church and I knew Lee through his wife Joy. And later he told me that he mainly knew me through my husband John. And then one day he called me in late January of '89. He called and wanted to know if I would go to lunch with him. - Actually I wanted to be with somebody who knew what it was like to lose. She had lost a husband, I had lost a wife. - He just wanted to talk, really. Just to meet and talk and share and cry and just have some conversation with me. - And we went to a little place called The Whistle Stop, next to Elizabethtown. And we spent four and a half hours in this little restaurant and I gotta tell you, I tell this so many times. Four and a half hours at that restaurant and I fell in love with the second woman of my life. - Both of us removed our wedding bands the night before, so we had held onto our wedding bands and really held on to our wedding vows until we had decided to meet and be with someone else. - And we started dating a little bit more and it wasn't long after that that I asked her to marry me. I look at all that and I lost two little girls, but God gave me two more little girls, same ages, basically the same ages. Christy was into music, Kristen was into music. Tiffany was into sports, Robin was into sports. And he's a bonus. Not only did I get my little girls back, or two little girls back, but I got a son, Robby. - The biggest thing about having him enter our life and my dad not being there anymore was just the simple thing that we missed having a dad. We genuinely missed calling somebody Daddy. - The three kids had got together, and they were 15, 12, and seven, and my Christmas present that year was they decided to start calling me Dad. All the memories that I thought that I had lost, God gave 'em back. When I said I didn't get to see my little girls go on their dates, I got to see these little girls go on their dates. Teaching how to drive a car. Seeing 'em graduate. Walk 'em down the aisle and give 'em to the man of their choice. Everything that I thought I lost on May the 14 1988, God gave me back. (uplifting music) - If this incident particularly directly affects people, didn't drive people to causes then I don't know what would. But many many people have taken this tragedy and made good things out of it. - I had seen the president of Hardin County MADD on interviews on television. And I thought I can join MADD and I'm gonna stop drunk driving in this country. - I did a couple of presentations for SADD, Students Against Drunk Driving. As far as I'm an example of why you should not drink and drive because look what can happen. - Through my television interviews after the bus crash I caught the attention of MADD national and I was elected to the board, the MADD national board in 1990 and in 1998 was elected as the national president of MADD, to be the spokesperson of over three million Americans was daunting. - All of you children, your husbands, your wives go with me every where I go, and you give me the strength to do what I do. - I had a big concern myself getting back on a bus for the first time. Me being in sports, that's how we get to all our ballgames. But now of course I got two of my own now that are elementary age, so I always tell them, I've often told them if anything like this happens, you gotta promise Dad that you will fight like anything to make it out. And of course I always kiss 'em and tell 'em I love 'em. - Through our church, one of the ladies asked me, she said have you ever thought about driving a bus? I'm like no, no way. Finally one day I was like you know what? I got a daughter here to go to college, I need to make a little more money. And I tell people today if you had told me I was gonna drive a bus two years ago man I'd have said you was crazy. And now driving a school bus is the most rewarding thing I've ever done in my life. - There is a true bond that we all have and that we all have a story to be told and it needs to be told. - For many many years I thought I wanted to be a doctor and work with burn patients. Later then got a degree in nursing and I actually got a job as a nursing assistant while I was still in nursing school at Shriner's Hospital, their burn hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. And I found out that I didn't like taking care of burn patients. - There was an old riverboat cruise ship in Louisville and so we went up there and had dinner on the boat. - He gets kinda close to this light post, he said hey, stand here for a minute, and he turned me around. - I got down on one knee because I told her that she needed to be able to tell that story to our kids one day. - Tell our children, and he pulled out a ring, he goes, yeah, 'cause I'm asking you to marry me. It was so sweet and so perfect and it was just like yes. - I ended up getting a job on an oncology floor, bone marrow transplant to be specific, and I loved it and I still felt like I was giving back. As far as doing something for others that the nurses had done for me. - I have a unique situation because for Wayne and I that day holds a special memory and both of us get to where we you know, may be hitting us different each day. But we have each other and we go to each other and I can say you know I don't know why but I'm just really kinda missing my dad today. I don't know what's happened to have brought it up, and I can just fall into his embrace and he just knows how my day's playing that day. - Every May 14th gets around that area my whole demeanor, my whole attitude, everything changes. I don't even realize it's happening. It's almost like you got a sixth sense of the day. - Horrible things happen to people every day. And the experience of life is just what you get when you don't get what you thought you were getting through life, that's called an experience. And the experience that I went through with my husband, I hope that I have learned from this that what you are before a great tragedy, you're the same person after that tragedy, only it's magnified. - I've actually had several truck drivers tell me that they saw the news and they saw the sign and they said I'll tell you, I still drink, but I don't drink and drive no more. - [Voiceover] Harold Dennis, right up the middle of the field, Harold Dennis over the 35 and a quarter yard line! - Enrolled in UK, not really with the intention right away of become a football player, but ultimately walked on UK's football team and again, just another milestone. Another step in that healing process personally. - [Voiceover] Harold has been honored as the first recipient of the Johnny (mumbles) Award for courage in sports as well as the Gene Autry and Eric Kay courage in sports awards. He carried the Olympic torch during its march to Atlanta. - It helped me see that there are people out there who can see beyond the exterior. They can look past the physical and look in somebody's eyes and somebody's heart and really get to know them and see them as a human being and who they are in their personalities and their ideals and what drives them and their humor. Honestly, I didn't know that those people existed at the time. - Someone said well now that you remarried and you have all these kids, it's kinda like chapter two. No. It's not chapter two, this is a whole new book. - My daughter Patty wrote a speech destiny choice not chance and she wrote it for a contest that she was going to be competing with seniors in high school and she was only in the fourth grade and on Tuesday night, May the 10th, she gave this speech and she said, "I feel that destiny is a choice made by you, "destiny should not come by chance. "If destiny comes by chance you may not have a good life, "you may not live the way that you want to. "Your future should not be left to chance. "You have the choice to improve your destiny. "To meet your destiny, you must be careful "to make the right choices because you may only have "one chance." She delivered this three minute speech on Tuesday night, and on Saturday night her destiny was met by one man who made the wrong choice to drink and drive. When she said "to meet your destiny you must be careful "to make the right choices because you may only have "one chance." And that's a phrase I live by. Make the right choices because you may only have one chance. Little did she know. (dramatic music) (sentimental music)
