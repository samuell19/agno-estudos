Welcome to Dogedin. Well, technically, it's Dunedin, but as you can see, our town might be small, but our love for dogs is big. Of course, it's the perfect small town now, but perfect can get a little boring, and that's how this summer was starting to look. But boy, were we wrong. Everything changed when a very special dog showed up: My dog Radar. Uh, don't you mean our dog? Fine, our dog. This is Kylie. This summer we got to see Radar do all kinds of cool stuff. - Like... - Gabe, don't give away the story! Sorry. Let's just start at the beginning. I guess it all started with these two geniuses. Jeez Louise, Doc. Couldn't you take the ramp?! At last! At last, Dobbins! Glorious, delectable freedom! For over a year I was languishing in that infernal cesspool, finger painting and making popsicle stick houses whilst hoping, yearning, dreaming for this stupendous moment where my flesh can roam as free as my genius intellect. I still can't believe it worked, Doc! Broad daylight? Well, everyone escapes at night. But daytime? No one will see that coming. You must remember, Dobbins. The obvious is reserved for simpletons. Mm-hmm. Run! You must be the new chief. Yes. Joe Ramey. Sebastian Fleming, the mayor of Dunedin. - Just like the picture. - Uh, yeah. Ethel! Come on out and meet the new chief! - That's the new chief? - Mm-hmm. I have girdles older than him. Cursed with a baby face. Come on now, Ethel, be nice. He's come all the way from Miami. - We're lucky to have him. - Miami? Why on God's green Earth would you come here? Ethel is your secretary, receptionist and dispatch, all rolled into one saucy person. Wow. I have not seen one of those in a while. We got this just last month. Brand new fax machine. Huh. They escaped yesterday from the prison for the criminally insane, apparently. Ugh. They want us to put 'em up. I'm gonna go make copies. Great. I'll get one of the officers on it right away. Officers? Yes. Where is everyone else, by the way? It's just you and me, sweetheart. Look, I know this operation is probably smaller than you're used to, and you might be saying to yourself right now, "Oh, my God. What did I get myself into? My life is over, all my dreams are crushed." But Dunedin grows on you... or so they say. And you get used to the quiet, after a while. Trust me. Quiet is good. Outstanding. Okay, time to start the day. Make sure you put those up. How dangerous could these jokers be? Ah, home, sweet home! Here, within these walls, we shall commune with science itself to create that which has never been created! Cool. Your response is overwhelming. Come, let's see to fruition the brainchild which has taken me years to birth. Oh, good thinking, Doc. I'm starving. Oh, it's not food. Here, within this icy chamber, lies a one-way ticket to riches beyond our wildest dreams. Well, mine anyway. Behold, Dobbins. When I'm finished with her, she'll be the greatest thing that's ever walked the planet! How's a dead dog gonna do that? She's not dead! She's frozen... in time! I relieved her from a shelter just before they got me on tax fraud. Tax fraud? I thought it was because you went insane. - Hmm. A technicality, Dobbins. A mere technicality. Oh, they laughed at me at medical school... they laughed at me at MIT. They even laughed at me at my needlepoint class. But I will show them. I will teach them. I will teach them all! It's alive! It's alive! Whoa! She looks like a real dog! Well, of course she looks real! We don't want her to arouse any suspicion. Her mannerisms and appearance must seem natural. Oh, yes, she's my perfect creation and I am her Frankenstein. Well, wouldn't she be Frankenstein? No, you fool. I'm Frankenstein. I'm pretty sure the monster is Frankenstein. Geez, read a book, Doc. I refuse to argue Gothic literature with an imbecile. What are we going to name her? We?! I am going to name her... Dog. - That's no fun. - I didn't build her for fun. I built her to find undiscovered pirate treasure. She's a R.A.D.A.R. A Remote Activated Doubloon Acquiring Rex. What's a doubloon? Spanish gold! Beautiful Spanish gold! And the coast of Florida is littered with it! And all these gadgets on her are gonna help us find it? Correct. And not only can she understand English, she can connect to any cellular device and communicate via text. Whoa! Really? Yes. The dog can text. Hardly a stroke of inventive genius. Any five-year-old can do that. Okay, so, Dog, what do you think of the name of Lady Cecily Von Finglesworth? Dobbins, let's keep it simple. Her name is Dog. She says "Call me what you wish, Master." He is not your master. I am your master. And I make the rules, and your name is Dog! Now, Dog, are you ready to make me rich? "Yes, Master." Good girl. Mother would be so proud. Well, that's it, it's been a long day. Our training begins tomorrow. Uh, Doc... I-I-I feel bad leaving her here all alone. Oh, come on, Dobbins! She doesn't have any feelings. It's not like she's a real dog at all. Come on, it's been a long day. So, what have you got planned for the summer? - Not much. - Same. I might help my mom at the café, but there's no point, really. It's usually empty. Oh, my God. She makes the best desserts. Yeah. Too bad there's hardly anyone around to eat them. Tell me about it. This place is a ghost town, only not nearly as cool, 'cause there's no ghosts. Hm. Yeah. See ya tomorrow? Maybe we can look for sea glass or something. Yay. Now, Dog, today is your first day of training. I have hidden a doubloon somewhere within these walls. - Your job is to retrieve it. - Oooh. Like hide and seek. I love hide and seek. I used to play hide and seek with my family. They still haven't found me. Quelle surprise. Swiftly moving on. Now once her training is complete, I will instruct her to go find the largest cache of doubloons in America. - Just like that? - Yes. No fancy code word or Bat-signal? Just "Dog, go find the largest cache of doubloons in America". Whoa! She's really fast! Well done, Dobbins! Now we lost her! We'll just use the tracking device. Tracking device? Well, she's a bionic dog. I mean, surely you put one in her... Didn't you? Oh, shut up, Dobbins! Um... There's my boy. How was your last day of school? - Excited about your summer? - Totally. Well, I had another busy day at the cafe. Not just one or two customers, but three! Can you believe it? Things will pick up. What? There's something I need to talk to you about. You know hard things have been on us these past few years since... - Since Dad. - Yes. Let's face it. This town is on its last legs, and I don't know what else to do, but... You know how much I love it here, but I think it's time to sell the diner and move. Move?! This is our home! I know. I don't want to either, but we'd be moving in with grandma in a bigger town, with more opportunities and... Wait a minute. I thought you hated it here? I do, but Ky-- Maybe we can move some place close and I can bring you here once a month for a visit. - That'd be nice, right? - No! This is so unfair! This is more than unfair! This is just... ugh! I wish you were here, Dad. Gabe? Can I come in? Yeah. Please don't be mad at me. You know if there was any other way... I miss him too. Every day. Remember when he and I used to sit in here and tell you stories? Your favorite was of your great-great- grandfather Ray Bernard, who used to search for pirate treasure. They all thought he was crazy to buy that plot of land, but he was convinced that under the property was the treasure of notorious pirate Silver-Tooth Sally. Seven days a week he dug in the dirt, looking for the long-lost jewel. And then one day, he never came back. Some wondered if he'd found he sapphire and just left his old life behind him, but others wondered if he met with an accident while digging. Either way, neither he or the sapphire have ever been found. Don't you think I'm a little too old for these stories now, Mom? Maybe our family's just cursed. No, no, hey. We've just had a string of bad luck, which means we're due for some good luck soon. Kylie! Does your dad still have that metal detector? - All this land used to belong to your family? - Yeah. My great-great grandmother sold it after her husband disappeared. - All right. Let's say it is real, this Sapphire of... - Savoy? Savoy. It's been gone for, like, hundreds of years. Do you really think we're going to find it just digging around in the dirt? Look. If you don't want to do this... What I don't want is for you to have to move. If we find it, I won't have to. - What is that? - I don't know. Oh my God, I think I see something. What is it? - It's a... - What? Bottle cap. It's okay, we'll just keep... Gabe. No. You're right. This was a stupid idea. If my great-great grandfather couldn't find it after all this time, what makes me think that I can? Don't worry. We'll think of something. I just wish he could give me a sign, you know? Just a hint of where it might be. When did you get here? Aww. She doesn't like that you're sad. Good dog. Hi, girl. Hey, I recognize this hat. This is my great-great grandfather's hat. I've seen it in his picture before. Where did she get this? I think she wants us to follow her. - Let's go! - Come on! Oh, my God! This must be where my great-great grandfather used to dig. Did you happen to see any blue sapphires while you were digging in that dirt? I wonder if she has an owner. Check out her collar. It just says Radar. No address, no phone number, nothing. Radar, I wish I could keep you, but Mom would kill me. I've gotta get home. Let's try this spot tomorrow. I mean, if she found my great-great grandfather's hat, maybe there's a sapphire down there too. Well, we didn't get the sapphire today, but she's a lot cuddlier. Yeah. What happened to you? You're absolutely filthy. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. - She won't stop following me. - Oh, sure. Gabe, look, you know I love dogs, but we just can't. The last thing we need is a dog to feed and take to the vet. But look what she found! What's that? Kylie and I went digging out for the Sapphire of Savoy, and we... Well, Radar found this hat. And we think it might be your great grandfather's. And if it is his, then that means that we might be getting closer to finding the Sapphire of Savoy. Well... I doubt it's his hat, but it does look a lot like it. I'll take it to Artie today. He loves old stuff like this. Now you get upstairs and get cleaned up, young man, and say goodbye to your friend. But Mom... Oh, my God! Oh... Oh, my God! I can't believe it. What is it? I think you found the Sapphire of Savoy. Hey! Debbie! What brings you in? I'm here to see Chief. Oh, well, just a moment. I'll get him for you. Hey, Chief! I forgot we had a new police chief. I'm Chief Joe. Joe Chief. I mean, I'm Chief Ramey. He's from Miami. He got a big award there for heroism. I Google things! What can I do for you...? - Uh, Debbie. - Debbie. Well, the kids were out digging around that property that my grandma donated and they found this. I don't believe it. - It-it can't be. - Can't be what? What is it? It's the Sapphire of Savoy. - Uh... - Um... Okay... long story short, a pirate named Silver-Tooth Sally stole a famous jewel, the Sapphire of Savoy, and it was rumored that she hid it off the coast of Dunedin. But I found it! - Mm-hmm. - Well, she did. Cute dog. Now look. I don't want to burst your bubble. I mean, regardless, this looks very cool, - this Sapphire of McCoy. - Savoy. Savoy. But the odds of you finding something like this, if it even exists... I hate saying something like this, but don't you think it's a little bit more likely that someone hid some fake sapphire there just to play a mean joke? I mean... It is a famous legend here, like you guys said. Doesn't hurt to check. I mean, you're not busy. - Not in this town. - True enough. We should call Artie. He would know. - Artie? - Um... He runs the pirate museum down the block. He used to be a professor in Tampa. Or was it Tallahassee? It was somewhere. Anyway, he specializes in this kind of thing. All right, then. Let's call Artie. Just don't get your hopes up, okay? Artie... the displays haven't changed here in 30 years. I don't have anything to change them with. Artifacts, at least those worth seeing, cost money. Now, maybe if I had a benefactor - who could donate... - Oh, Artie. Nobody is going to donate any expensive artifacts to a silly pirate museum. Plastic! Oh, Artie, I'm sorry. That was out of line. But we gotta do something! This town is dying. How-- what if we just... re-labeled a few things? Re-labeled? You know, put a spin on them. A spin? Like... not lie, but... kinda lie. Mayor, I don't think I'd be very comfortable doing something like... Yarrrrr! Dunedin Pirate Museum. They found what?! Well, is it the Sapphire of Savoy or not? Well, there's no concrete evidence that the Sapphire of Savoy was hidden in Dunedin... even if it existed at all. Now legends are tricky... and I only deal in... facts. And the fact is, this here is a genuine and flawless sapphire! Really? Really? - Aww. - Good girl. I must confess, I am absolutely stunned! Oh, my God! Oh, boy, you really saved this town! We did? - Yes! - You bet! You just found pirate treasure! - We need to call the local news... - Yeah! No, no, the national news! The-- No, global! The whole world! Okay, with this sapphire, I can put Dunedin back on the map! Tourists will start coming back! We-we can do a-a-a pirate festival like we used to do! - Yeah! Yeah! - You'll love that. Oh, that's a good idea! I wonder if I still have my old corset. I was quite the saucy bar wench back in my day. Yes! A festival celebrating this discovery is exactly what we need! Don't forget about Radar. She's the real hero. She found the sapphire. That's one heck of a dog your kid has right there. Yes. - Yes, it is. - - Yeah, she's a good girl. Thank you. Thank you so very much. Thank you. Welcome to a very, very, very special afternoon. I, of course, am mayor Sebastian Fleming, but you already know that. Whatcha doin', Doc? I'm cross-referencing algorithms, statistics and odds of treasure locations throughout America to determine what route that mangy mutt may have taken. With that data, I'll input it into the circumnavigator and should be able to make an educated guess as to the location of Dog. Huh? Oh, forget it. I doubt your feeble mind can grasp the intricacies of geographical statistics and plausibility calculations. What?! I'm trying to find this stupid dog, which is more than what you're doing, you thick-witted, imbecilic addle pate! Oh... Okay. Hey, Doc? Is that the same-- is that the same-- I'm working here, Dobbins! Working! Dunedin is a town rich in history. We were once known for being one of the most notorious pirate havens in the region. Argh! And we continue that tradition today, albeit in a more family-friendly way by having one of the most toured pirate museums in all of Florida. We also used to host an annual pirate festival, which I am very pleased to say, we will be doing again very soon. Piracy was so prevalent in Dunedin back in the day that gold doubloons are still found among our beaches. But I must confess, we never thought a treasure like this would be discovered on our shores. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you... the Sapphire of Savoy! Yes... Starting today, we will be showcasing this beauty at our world-renowned pirate museum! Which one of you found the Sapphire of Savoy first? Neither, actually. - It was Radar. - Can you believe it? It was the boy's dog! The boy's dog found the sapphire! Now that is what I call a man's best friend! Uh... Doc, I really think you need to look at this. What is it, Dobbins?! What is it?! Actually, I found it... - The dog. - It's Dog! Right in front of you the whole time and you didn't even notice! - Well, I-I-- - Shh! And you mom let you keep him? Well, if no owner steps forward, you bet I'll let him keep the dog. Well, listen, after what she found, if you guys don't want her, I'll certainly take her! - Right? - She's mine, - you yappy local yokel! - Yes, yes. It must be said that these kids, and, um... - Radar. - Radar, yes. I'm sorry, Radar, of course, they have breathed new life into Dunedin! And we welcome everyone to come visit our town, see the Sapphire of Savoy, and have lunch at the Wild Iris Café, owned by our very own Debbie Iris, the mother of Gabe here. So, who knows? You might even find your own treasure on the beaches of beautiful Dunedin. Group photo! Group photo! Come, Dobbins. We must traverse to that nonentity mildewy town to retrieve that which is ours! I don't know, Doc. Seems like a really nice place, and the pirate museum seems kinda cool! Shut up, Dobbins. We have a dog to catch. And a sapphire to pilfer. Here you go, Radar. I don't care what you say, vanilla's the best flavor. Looks like Radar agrees with you. Aww... Is that your mom? - It just says "Yes." - Yes, what? "Yes, I agree with you." What? Who's sending this? Well, you did just say Radar agrees that vanilla is the best. Yeah, right. What's your problem? Did she just... No! She couldn't have... Could she? - You gonna to get it? - You get it! Heck, no! You get it! It's your phone! It says, "Yes. I did text." Nu-uh. Someone's pulling a prank. Okay. Forget the phone for now. If she can text us, then she can understand us, right? Radar, smile! What is she? - I don't know. - Ask her. Why is it always me? She says she's bionic. Bionic? What's that? Whoa! Oh, my God. My dog is a superhero! Come here, girl! And that's okay? Your dog can text and open up and this isn't weird at all? No, it's not weird! It's freakin' awesome! All right, yes, having a "super dog" is cool and all, but think about it. I doubt she was born that way. She was made that way. What's your point? My point is, if you made a bionic dog, wouldn't you want it back? Now that disobedient monster has escaped us. We need to find something, a vehicle of some sort that's large enough to contain her once we catch her. A van maybe, or a truck of some sort. - Doc... - Something large enough... - Doc. - What?! Oh... I didn't take high school shop for nothing. Act like it's yours. Doc, get in. See if there's any keys. Oh, the trusty clipean left the keys inside. You drive, Dobbins. We have a new mission now. First, we retrieve Dog, and then the sapphire. Yeah, but the kid has the dog and the town has the sapphire. Dog will always be loyal to her creator. And with her help, fetching the sapphire from these village idiots will be elementary at best. Ah, there's the museum. Find somewhere inconspicuous for us to park. Perfect place, Dobbins. It's about 7,000 square feet on the roof. - Hello, welcome to Dunedin. - Thanks! Naturally, of course, the sapphire itself will be in a-- probably be in a protective case, - and under armed guard. - Hmm. This will, no doubt, be a challenge. Hmm... My God, Dobbins! This is going to be easier than I thought. Uh, Doc? In fact, I'm feeling a bit crestfallen. Uh, Doc. I really wanted a bit of a challenge. - Doc. - What is it, Dobbins?! Oh. What are we going to do? We're going to quickly and quietly go back to the camper. Don't make any eye contact, keep your head down, and distort your face so you won't be recognized. I can feel people looking at us. Are they looking at us? - No one is looking at us. - Are you sure? If they're looking, it's because they're seeing a grown man crying. - I can't help it. - Cease your whimpering. - I'm trying! - Oh! Pull yourself together, you miserable sack! Get in! - Oooh! Look! - What?! What is it?! - Pie! - Pie?! You ingrate! Ow! What? And look who's serving it! Oh, yeah. Hey, hey, didn't we see her on TV? - She's the boy's mother. - Oh. All we have to do is follow her home and she'll lead us to Dog. Then, Dog will help us get our sapphire. Well, this is a nice surprise. How can I help you, Chief? Call me Joe, please. Joe. Well, I heard you have the best key lime pie this side of Key West, so I thought I should stop by and give it a try. Mm. Great. You prefer indoors or outdoors? Al fresco, please. Right this way. "This beautiful museum is housed..." Could you please show some initiative and help with surveillance? Dobbins? Dobbins, what are you reading?! It's a pamphlet about the pirate museum. - Oh. - Yeah, I printed it out before we left. - It's actually pretty cool. Yeah. - This is great. May I see it? This is so empowering. She has no idea we're watching her. Yeah. I mean, this is better than anything in Key West. Well, thanks, Joe. This one's on the house. Hey, do you ever get out? I-I mean, for dinner. Uh, not really. Taking care of Gabe and running the diner, it's just not a lot of time, you know. And Gabe's father is... He passed away a few years ago. Afghanistan. I'm so sorry. Yeah, it was a difficult time, especially for Gabe. I'm sorry. What were we talking about? Um, I... I was just wanting to know... I mean... I understand if you don't want to... I understand... I mean... Ahem. Would you like to go to dinner with me? Oh! Um... Sorry, that was awful timing. Never mind, I'm... Sure! - Really? - Mm. Uh, great. Uh, dinner tomorrow, Casa Tina? You can fill me in on the whose and wheres of the town. Yeah, yeah, all right. Just let me see if I can find a babysitter for Gabe. With all these wanted posters around, it just has me a little paranoid, you know? I can ask Ethel. I'm sure she'd be more than happy to help. - Really? - Sure. Come on. It'll do you good. - Meet me at seven? - Sounds like a plan. Okay. Hey, Larry. Dishes are washed. Napkins, salt and pepper re-stocked for you. Can you hold down the fort until Ruth arrives? She's running a little late. - Sure thing, Deb. Anything to help. - Thanks. - It's a cop. - Ah, yes. A provincial lawman. Looks like he walked out of a hacky movie of the week. I'm sure he's a bona fide Clint Eastwood. And, hey, be careful going home. I saw a bunch of flyers about some escaped nut jobs out there. It's just a short walk home. I'm sure I can survive that. All right, bye-bye. There she goes. Follow her. Why can't you come over? My mom says as soon as I'm done cleaning my room, I can head back. That's gonna take you hours to clean that mess. We need to form a game plan on how to hide Radar's identity. Sorry, but I haven't cleaned my room in two days. That's only two days' worth of mess? Dang, and I thought girls were clean. Shut up. Follow her closely, Dobbins. But not too closely, else we shall arouse suspicion. Ah, okay. Now what? Reconnaissance, Dobbins. Reconnaissance. What do you see through the binos, Doc? I see the thermal images of two people-- an adult, and a child... and a canine. I wonder if it's Lady Cicely Von Finklesworth? I'm so glad your mom decided not to move. Me too. Oh! Some TV show people called her and they want to do a reality show where they dig where we found the sapphire to see if there's any more treasure down there. They think since there's a sapphire, there's gotta be more treasure to find. Time is of the essence. We strike now. Broad daylight again? Oh, the prison break was a fluke. Besides, this time I have an even better trick up my sleeve. Oh, my God, you're going to be on TV?! That's so cool! Can I be on TV? Sure, if she decides to do it. They want to put a spin on it to where the treasure is cursed or haunted or something. Is it? No, but they think it'd be more interesting that way. She thinks it's weird to make up stuff. She doesn't know if she's going to do it. And it is pretty lame to make up ghosts. I'll pretend to be afraid of ghosts if I get to be on TV. I don't care. I'm worried about Radar getting too much press. The more she's on TV, the bigger the odds of her creators coming and getting her. Now, if anyone stops us, just say we're investigating a report of Japanese murder hornets in the area. Got it. What about the kids? What are we gonna do when they see us climbing through the window? Gas 'em. Oh, fear not, Dobbins. It just renders them unconscious long enough for us to get Dog back and retrieve the sapphire. Right there. Perfect. - Was that Radar growling? - Yeah. I can't do heights, Doc. I just can't! I just can't! You're literally two feet off the ground! Oh, come on, Dobbins! We don't have time for your acrophobia. Get down! There's spiders too? That's arachnophobia, you ninny! I think she hears something. Would you just get down and let me do it?! I can't move. I'm too scared. You're afraid to go up, and you're afraid to come down! Do not yell at me. You are just making it worse. What is it, Radar? She says her creators are outside, and they're bad people! Well, what do I do? Call the cops, genius! But if the cops find out she's bionic, they might take her away! Look, Doc! It's her! Excellent! She senses her master's presence. Come here, girl. That's right. You know who you belong to. Now come to your master. What are you doing? Ow! Ow! No! No! No! Hmm. Get the ladder, and let's get outta here. Gabe? Gabe! - Come on! Hurry up! - I'm coming! Radar, what happened?! Oh, my God! Radar! Come on! Are you there? Gabe! Phew! That was close. Radar ran them off. - You think they'll be back? - I don't know. But I do know... is I'm not gonna give up Radar without a fight. And I'll never let them take you. You're family now. What did she say? She says that we're her family too. Aww. Well, that didn't go well. What an astute observation, Dobbins. I had no idea you held such vast powers of perception. Maybe we can go back with some treats. Hmph. Only if they're laced with strychnine. Turn here, Dobbins. I need a moment to soothe my nerves and re-strategize. That Judas Iscariot, mangy, good-for-nothing mutt! How dare she betray me?! I told you we should've given her a real name. Shut up. Doc! Doc, someone's headed this way! Oh, my goodness. A local yokel who is taking a stroll on a public beach. Whatever shall we do, Dobbins? No, but what if he recognizes us? Here. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Dr. Vanhook, I presume? And you must be Dobbins. Run! Get out of my way! But where are we running? But-- To the sea, Dobbins! To the sea! Uh, wait-- But it's cold! I want to make a deal! What kind of deal? I'm assuming you're here for the sapphire, and seeing as how you tried to break into that kid's home-- yes, I have been following you-- I'm assuming you were planning on kidnapping the kid in exchange for the jewel. Actually, we were just try-- Who are you, and what do you want? I'm the Mayor, and what I want is out. Go on. I have a plan, a plan that could be beneficial to both parties. I'm intrigued. Please. Come into my office. - Good morning, Miami! - Good morning, Ethel. What is this? Breakfast. What did you do? What do you want? Nothing! Geez! I've raised five boys. When you do something nice, it's because you did something bad, or you want something. Now I can't imagine you doing anything bad, so I'm going to go with you want something. It's called being nice, Ethel. Mm-hmm. Okay, then. You hear anything about those escaped convicts? Nope. Hm. Okay. Oh, one more thing. Here it comes. What do you want? Nothing. I don't want anything! It's Debbie. She needs a babysitter tonight for Gabe. Why on earth would Debbie need a-- Oh, you and Debbie! So? Will you do it? Of course. That poor girl could use a night out. - Thank you, thank you, thank you! - Okay, okay, okay... - Just save that for your date! - Thank you so much! Go on. They're obviously bad guys, like Radar said, else they would've just knocked on the door and asked for her back. Well, whoever it was, they'll definitely be back. But why did they make her? Doubloons? That's it! They must have sent her here for pirate treasure, and she found the sapphire. This is getting bigger and bigger. Maybe we should call the cops. No! If they find out she's bionic, they're gonna turn her over for the CIA to do experiments and stuff. They're not going to let a kid keep a bionic dog. True, but even if we manage to keep Radar, what if they take the sapphire? Then the town is bust again, and you'll have to move! Ugh! You're right. What do we do?! - Radar! - Radar! Radar! Thank God she's bionic! You're right! Kylie! I just got an idea! But we're gonna have to wait 'til tonight. Ugh! Radar, that's totally impossible! You're using a cheat code! That's so unfair! Gabe, can I talk to you for a minute? Sure, Mom. What's up? Kylie, can you give us a moment? Sure. You look really pretty. Oh. Thank you. Radar, you want a treat? Am I doing the wrong thing? Huh? This date. I shouldn't be going on this date, should I? I don't know. I feel bad. Mom, I'll be fine tonight. I'm not a baby. No, no, it's not that. It's just I... I feel like I'm not being faithful to your father. Mom, don't. Dad would want you to be happy. And I want you to be happy too. It's kinda weird seeing my mom go on a date, but I'll get used to it. Oh, you're a trooper. And Kylie was right. You do look really pretty. Oh. She's here. - Hey! - Hi! - Wow! You look great! - Oh, thank you. - Hey, kids! - Hey! Okay, so I am headed out. Miss Ethel here is going to babysit you. Babysit? Mom, but I'm nearly 12 and Kylie is here, and-- Uh-uh-uh. No buts. It's settled. There are two escaped convicts running around here. We're not taking any chances. All right, I have my phone if you need anything, and don't answer the door for anyone that you don't know. Mama, they'll be fine. If I can handle five wild boys, - I can handle these two. - Okay. All right. So you just go on out... - Bye! - ...and have fun. Go. - Bye-bye. - Bye, bye, bye. Bye. So... Who wants to play poker? You kids today! All about computer games and God knows what else. What you need is some good old-fashioned know-how. Yeah. That's what my grandfather taught me. Hey. What have you got for me, girl? We need to get rid of Ethel for a while. And I'm talking way, way back, the old chief, and I call him old because I think he was a friend of Abe Lincoln's. That's perfect. So, he's looking at this man who has hair down to his backside, and he says, "Ma'am, I think you would probably want to shave before you go to court." - What? Did someone cut the cheese? She'll be okay. Come on. Let's go. No time to lose! Now, I want you to turn right. Uh, my right, or your right? Oh, just park somewhere! Yes! This will be sufficient. Just pull up and park by the, uh, refuse up ahead. - Where? - The dumpster, Dobbins. Oh, yes. Right here. What do you see, Radar? - All clear. Okay. Let's go! Now, the mayor said he disabled the cameras, so there should be no trail leading to us. I can't believe we're gonna split the money with him. Ha! That's what that fool thinks. There's no honor among thieves, Dobbins. No, no, no, no, no. Once we have the sapphire in our clutches, we will quickly abscond, and we'll be on our way. But he could tell everybody that it was us. - Ah, not without showing his complicity. - Oh... We just need him to keep his mouth shut long enough so that we can get the sapphire, and we'll be on our way and home free. Now the mayor told me he would leave this door unlocked. Plan B. My bag. If we had that turncoat of a dog, we wouldn't need these crude instruments. - The window? Smash it. - Oh. Doc? You okay, doc? I don't know what just happened, but I'm blaming you. Can you get us in? Ugh... "One second." - Whoa! You make keys?! - Awesome! Come on! Help me up. Forget the window. We'll find another way in. Don't tell me we're too late. - Quick! Hide! - Here. Put these on. You must be new. They make 'em better every year. That was close. They must've stored the sapphire somewhere else. She's got the scent. Come on. Did you hear something, Radar? That way. - It's them. - The safe! We gotta hurry. Can you get us in, Radar? Got it. Turn right. Stop. What happened? Batteries are out. You didn't put new batteries in it? How was I supposed to know the batteries were old? Forget it! We'll do it in the dark. In and out. Hurry up, Radar! Turn left. What?! That dust-covered ingrate must have locked it up somewhere, and that inept mayor failed to mention where the safe was. Let's go check upstairs. Turn right. Stop. Open. This way! She says grab her. At last, Dobbins! The prize is mine! - Don't you laugh at me! - I-I wasn't laughing! - Don't you laugh at me! - I-I wouldn't-- Don't you laugh at me!! Ow! That hurt! Good! That. Was. Awesome! Totally! I'm telling you, I didn't laugh, Doc. Oh, I deserve to be laughed at! This has been such a failure of epic, monumental proportion, I have half a mind to turn myself in to the authorities for incompetence. You peed yourself too? - Not incontinence! - Okay. Dobbins, shut your trap before I throttle you again. Just rotten luck is all, Doc. No such thing. I was outfoxed by that covetous mayor who took us off the trail just long enough so that he could pilfer the sapphire and blame us for it. Ugh! You don't think that's the kids, do you? Oh, yes. Some juveniles from Podunk, Nowhere outsmarted me and stole the sapphire? Not likely! Use your head, Dobbins! - I wonder what they're doing over there, then. - What? They're headed home, where they think they'll be safe and sound. This is going to be like taking candy from a baby. Well, what about Dog? Oh, I'm more than prepared for Dog this time. Once we're in range, it's night-night, doggie. Hmm... We'll wait till light. Mm-hmm. The mother will be at work, and they'll be home alone. And that's when we strike! Let's call the mayor and tell him there's been a delay. So, the plan is, Radar will make us invisible again, then we can sneak into the museum and leave the sapphire. - Got it. - - Hold it right there! I want what is mine, and I want it now! This is your last chance, kiddies, or you can say "goodbye, Lassie"! Fine. We'll give you the sapphire. But you leave Radar alone. Radar! Cool name. Be silent! It's a terrible name. - So, it's a deal? - Sure. Why not? Who needs a disloyal dog anyway? Ha ha ha! - Oh... - Oh! Oh, you poor, dimwitted, trusting children. Bye, bye, doggie! No! You forgot to put batteries in it, didn't you? Gabe! Grab the bag! Run! - Get after them! - Okay! No! To the truck! Hey, I got your text to come over. - What's going on? - I'm so sorry, Debbie, someone has stolen the sapphire. - What? - Chief, this is a disaster. A disaster! We'll never see that sapphire again, or the people who took it! I'm not so sure about that. What do you mean? Well, the cameras weren't rolling. I think it might've been an inside job. And if it was an inside job, then that means the criminal might be closer than we'd like to think. Inside job?! That's crazy talk! This is Dunedin. We're- we're a quiet little town full of law-abiding citizens. No. No. We have to accept the facts, okay? It is lost. The sapphire is lost, outsiders took it and we're never gonna see it or hear from them ever again. Oh, my God! Gabe! Idiots! - Confound it, Dobbins! - We lost them, Doc! If you weren't driving like a geriatric going to an early bird special, none of this would've happened! I can't help it! The speed limit is only 25! We don't observe speed limits. We're villains, for God's sake! Now drive! Wait, wait! Chief, Chief, Chief, hold on! Chief! Chief! Hold on. Listen. - Maybe you should wait for backup. - I'll be his backup. - What? - This could be dangerous. - Listen to him! It could be dangerous! - My son's out there! - Yeah, but backup's important for-- - Drive! Wait, you guys-- I-- I'll follow you! Onward, Dobbins! They couldn't have gone far. Thieving miscreants! Faster, Dobbins! Puttering cyclists! Out of the way! I think we lost them. Okay. Let's go. They found us! Radar! Do Something! What happened? This is intolerable! Well, you were the one who wanted to give her all these gadgets! To evade the police, not us! Let's go! Any State Troopers in the Dunedin area, 10-33. Over. 10-4. This is State Trooper Milligan. What's your emergency? 10-31, two escaped convicts, Phillipe Park. 10-24. Something's wrong with Radar. What's up, girl? Oh, no. Her battery is going dead. - You haven't been charging her? - I didn't know I had to. Radar, you've gotta get up! - Come on! - No, Radar, we won't leave you! She wants you to run! I can't! I can't leave her! You have to! Do it for Radar! Oh. Need to recharge there, you recreant perfidious corruption of science? They've gotta be somewhere! Joe! Please allow me to put you out of your misery. Dobbins, batteries. You better come back, kiddies, before your little friend here takes a walk across the Rainbow Bridge. Nighty night! - No! - Gabe! Come, Dobbins. Let's go retrieve my sapphire. Oh! Radar! Oh, what did they do to you? You're reading a text now? It's my emergency phone. I should check this. "Battery low. Please charge me." "This is Radar. Charge me!" Okay, so how do we plug you in, Radar? Well, where's the plug? Oh. Ew. - What are you doing? - Trust me! Oh, where did they go? I think they went that way. Don't be a fool. Let's go this way! Stop right there! We can do this the easy way and you can hand over the sapphire, or we can do this the hard way. Whoa, Doc! What is that? A freeze ray, Dobbins. Stereotypical? Yes. Trite? Perhaps. But I do love a classic. So, wait a second. Why didn't you use that earlier? Because I didn't want to, that's why! And now... now, I do. All right, Radar. Let's do this. With each gravitational force of the Moon upon the surface of the Earth, your fate becomes synonymous with "sleeping with the fishes." - Huh? - What? Why I'm even bothering with this kind of villainous flair is beyond me. The tide is coming in! Let's simplify this for the juvenile brain, shall we? You can drown in the ocean, or you can just give us what we want, and we'll be on our way. One, two... Just give it to him. Okay, fine! I'll give you the sapphire. Well, well, well! Do you mind, Dobbins? This is my moment in the sun! - Well, well, well! - I just said that. Just shut up and take it already! So much for my monologue. Do you mind picking that up for me, Dobbins? Now there's just one little thing left to do. We gotta tie up a few loose ends. - What are you doing?! - We gave you the sapphire! Yes, and I thank you. But one cannot have witnesses. W-whoa, wait, wait, whoa, Doc. They're just kids. I don't think I can do this. Well, lucky for you, I'm more than happy to do the honors. Ow! Radar! I rue the day I gave her a laser eye! I rue it! - Dobbins? - Yeah? Those batteries that you gave me. - Where did they come from? - I got them out of my flashlight. Hmm. The one from the museum. - Yeah. How'd you know? - Lucky guess. What happened? Gabe! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you - in a court of law. - Ow. - Good girl! - Good girl! Good girl! Good girl! Hey, kids. Would you put the backpack and the gun on the hood, please? - Sure. - Absolutely. You're gonna stay right here. Oh, ho, ho! I see you've apprehended the thieves. Good job, Chief. Where's the, uh, sapphire? - It's-- - Backpack. All right, everybody. Stay back! Stay back! - Whoa. - Well done, Mr. Mayor. Now, can you get Barney Fife to uncuff us? - Nah, nah, I'm good. - We had a deal! Oh, please! You never intended to play fair and neither do I. I've played fair my entire life, and where's that gotten me? Mayor of some Podunk little town. I should be governor by now, or at least a Senator. No. No, no. I'm stuck here. I'm through having noble dreams, okay? This is my dream now! This sapphire right here will have me living in the lap of luxury for the rest of my days, far from here. Hey. You wanna help me out here? Really? Welcome to my world. Sorry, kids. Maybe when you're a little bit older, you'll understand that when you play by the rules, you come in last. - Hey, Milligan? - Yes, Chief. Yeah. What's your location? Northbound Phillipe Park. Perfect. So, in a minute or two, you're gonna have the Mayor headed your way, and I want you to pull him over and arrest him. Wait? What? Arrest the Mayor? Like as mayor Fleming, the Mayor? - All right, I see him up ahead. I'll explain later, all right? Thanks, Milligan. Radar! You let him get away with the sapphire! No, she didn't. Radar, go fetch the sapphire. I hid it. I knew she'd be able to sniff it out later. You little liar! - Good girl! - Good girl! You're making a huge mistake, officer. Huge mistake. I was not taking the sapphire, I was holding it for safekeeping. This could be your badge. You know who I am, right? I'm the Mayor. I'm the mayor of this town! I didn't do anything wrong! Officer! Hello, everyone. I want to thank you for coming to our little town of Dunedin. It really means the world to us. Now, I know we have a lot of out of towners here, and it's people like you that keep this town and its citizens thriving, and I want you to know that we appreciate you. But enough with all the mushy stuff. Unless you've been living under a rock, I'm sure you've heard about all the craziness that's happened here recently, and among all that chaos, two kids and a dog embodied what Dunedin stands for. Bravery... honesty... and kindness. Absolutely! Gabe, Kylie, and Radar, please step forward. For saving the sapphire, and pretty much this whole town, Dunedin would like to honor you with the certificate of bravery. Uh! Uh! And the pirate's sword of Dunedin. Yes! Yeah! Radar! Radar! Radar! Radar! Radar! Radar... And that's how we became the heroes of Dunedin, and Radar was honored on the legendary wall of Dogedin. And now, wherever Radar goes, it's free spa treatments, tons of tasty treats, ice cream. His favorite is still vanilla, because it's the best flavor. But bionic or not, her favorite thing of all is love.
