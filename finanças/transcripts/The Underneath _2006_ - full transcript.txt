It's you who wanted to go! - Besides - we're no longer buddies. - And neither am I. Michal! Anyone that's normal is alseep by now. You mean Michal is normal? And maybe I'm not? Hello! I was afraid you were hurt. Can you speak? Say something. Should we take him to a doctor? No, I'm fine - just tired. Tired my foot! You banged your onion! Remember? Don't look too hot. The girls are having a good time. Have you seen my latest piece of ass? Mate - what a rocket - does anything. Does this cute piece of ass have a name? - Ania - Did a part in our ad. - The same old Michal! Mate, she's the best. What tits! And what a screw! Want to see? See? What do you mean? - You've got her on video? - Of course! - And she said yes just like that? - Mate, they all say yes... - Haven't you got a video of Iza? - I don't have a cam. - She'd be a cert. - No way, Iza's not the sort. Yeah? How do you know? And how are things? - I haven't seen you for ages. - In fact - the same. - I've read a couple of your pieces. - Yeah? Where? Iza brought some to the agency. Didn't she say? Can't recall. Maybe it slipped my mind. Do you remember Agnieszka from 4b? She had a great pair of lungs eh? When I think of her now, we were all in love with her. Remember how we used to go to the toilets for a wank? - My Piotr too? - Of course... - Come off it. - Come off it? They all did, now too ashamed to admit it. - Honey - was it Agnieszka? - If only Agnieszka. And Asia? Yes Asia. - Hang on - what Asia? - No, no it was Dorota! And Iza? - What about Iza? - Iza? That was really something! - Michal stop it, it's not funny. - Iza - you should know! Miss Popularity! We had bets who'd be the one. - What are you talking about Michal? - Bets? And who won? Only Iza knows - right? Who won? Piotr did. - Yeah - well I didn't bet. - See - lucky guy. Ah, women... Piotr - don't smoke, you said you gave up. I met Agnieszka recently. A real beauty. Her husband spent big in our agency, a very good client. And what of it? Big spender, and the wife slept around... - Well - can't buy everything. - Know what? I was in Thailand recently and you can buy anything. - Been there? - No - we haven't. Like my film? - On what? - Art - but it's finished. Going to the footbridge? Can't see - anything. Shit. - Going to the footbridge! - Where? Footbridge! There! I can see you. Beautiful - beautiful. I've got it - wait. Let's get them. - Get me! - No, both. Good, wait. Got them! Wait. Do it once more! - No! My foot! - Footbridge you mean. Foot-bridge! Decaying footbridge of love! These are our latest sketches. Not bad? Look. What do you think? Think of what? Writing a plot, copy for ads. It's not like writing novels. Here the concept counts! Mainly the concept! Understand? A simple storyline, nail polish like any other, look at the elegance, the writing, how fucking sensitive it is. Look! Do you see? Understand? Need to see the detail, finer points. Understand? Anyway - you'll see when you get into ads you'll see life anew, begin to see things, like never before - see? I see. Details, finer points... And - nail tips! Did you know they're the strongest on the market? How would you advertise them? - You mean the plot? - No, not the plot - the line, the line for the ad - well? The strongest, longest lasting nail tips. Ok. Think it over. We'll get back to this later. Shall we go and see the cormorants? Now? Shall we go for a swim? I'd like to go into the town with Michal. Into town? Town? Buy a few things, make some calls.. Buy a few things. You don't need to repeat everything. No. Only surprised, you have to go today. Didn't say I have to. Said I want to. Anyway what's the surprise? Well off you go then. Piotr dear. Let's go! Coming to see the cormorants? Piotr dear. Let's go! Michal told me a lot about you. Yeah? What? You're a good writer that maybe you'll work for him. For Michal? You don't like him do you? It shows. True - we don't like each other. An old story... - A woman? - Is it that obvious? - Iza. - Let's not talk about it. Know what I think? I think Michal thinks highly of your writing. Really? Do you think he's read them? Don't know but says they're good - only they're sad. Sad. Why does everyone think that's bad? I don't. I just adore this. The water is sky and the sky, water and you've no idea of the truth. Have a go. Piotr! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to. I'm sorry. Say sorry once more. Wait - we shouldn't... - I've done the shopping. - Good. - Everything ok? - And you? Well that's thirty. Should be enough? What's with her? I've been thinking about this job for you. - Been talking with Iza. - With Iza? - And what did you two decide? - Fuck - tomatoes are for - Salad? Need to do some work on yourself. Open up a bit, understand? Learn to talk to others, listen... But you, mate, won't open up. Won't open up - understand. All it needs is a rinse! But your writing's good. I didn't have much time, gave your stuff to the guys at the agency. And know what, they were really impressed. But why the fuck is it so sad? - Sad? That's how you read it? - Yeah. Today people need affirmation. Joy and not some... - Michal - you confuse two things. - Yeah? What two things? That you can't compare ads with what I write. Well no - how can I! Hold me... - Had a think about that line? - Yes - well in fact - no. - Meaning yes or no? - Is the line that important? No. In fact it's important for you. If you don't mind I'll decide what's important for me. Hey - why are we so touchy? Didn't Iza roll over for you last night? Sons of bitches, gorging themselves all morning! Want her - well? Take her - she's yours. And what have I done to deserve such a present? I'm not joking, really. You can give her one. I've had enough. Can't believe it, you treat her like an object. What right do you have to talk about her that way? - My rights are set by me - ok? - Know what? You're washed up. No, I'm swimmming in it, absolutely swimming. Know what? I don't give a shit about you - it's Ania I'm worried about. Ania - think she screws me because she's a good scout? Mate - fucking wake up! She's just like all the others. No, she's not the same. No, she's not, just gives better head. Didn't it ever occur to you, that it could be different? Didn't you ever feel anything else? I did but then I understood, that it's not worth it - know why? Cause the one woman I really loved, chose a no hoper. - That's sick! - That's sick? Who are you, to judge me? Talented, promising Mr. PhD. You never came to anything, understand? Haven't been anywhere, even Thailand. See, you've nothing. Think you've got a sexy babe, that loves you, is faithful? - Mate, she's just like the others. - You're going too far. And it bothers you, you'd give anything to know. But you never will, how it is. I've been showing Piotr some techniques. You need some practice and think about that line. - Did you have a row!? - Well run to him! He must need you. And here's our next party guest. Doctor! Dear Piotr! The brightest, most educated, frustrated. But his time's out, on the horizon God's gorgeous creation, what hair, what lines and - God made Weronika! I see you're having a great time. Not bad. Well? Fancy a dance? Having a good time? - Great. - Great then. You never smoked. Don't tell me what to do. Never - understand?! Let go! Don't! Don't, I tell you! Have you gone crazy? Let me go! Michal! Have you seen Piotr?! Michal! Have you seen Piotr?! Fuck me dead. Mate, you're a mess. - Can you... - Ok. Ok. I'm leaving. I was worried about you yesterday. - Think it's worth it? - Don't talk like that. Where's Ania? Where is she? Don't know - maybe sleeping. Mate - when you see this you won't believe it. Not bad - eh? See! Fuck me! You really flew the kite! - Not bad... - My God - I don't remember a thing. And I'm not surprised. - And Ania? - Ania? - Where is she? - Don't know, how should I, not here. But Weronika is. That's how it is with women. They come, they go - need to change them otherwise you'd die of boredom. The two of you can pretend if you like. You think you can keep it up? How much longer? A year? Two? Three? I feel like throwing up when I hear all that shit - Love! Bonding! There is none! Only that short moment - of pleasure. And this is Weronika... No doubt you've forgotten. Babe let's take a peep, see what you have. That's repulsive. What's repulsive? You two are repulsive! I'll copy this piece on the armchair, a souvenir for you. Arsehole! Actually why are you with me? Think you know. - Sorry. - I know. Sorry. - Something wrong? - Nothing, just to need to check something. TRANSLATION Ryszard J. Reisner FOR MONOLITH VIDEO
