Ayee! See, mangas, the thieving ones left the stream here. The tracks of my white horse. Soon we'll get all our horses back. - [ Galloping ] - [ Chattering ] - [ Whinnies ] - Good hunting, eh, compadre? [ Speaking Spanish ] Riva. Que pasa, mujer? Does it take you two hours to fetch water from the stream? So, instead of doing your work, you spend your time swimming. That's the gratitude I get for giving you food and a place to sleep. [ Water splashes ] I carry water, and I chop wood, I cook. Besides, I must also protect myself from the dirty hands of your men. I earn my keep. - [ Gasps ] - Callese la boca, mujer. Tonight, you shall earn your keep. That I promise you. Go back to your cooking. After supper, querida, go down to the stream. I will bring horses. We will go away together. Des graciada. Is it not better to have the love of one hombre - than to be the slave of many? - [ Grunts ] Answer me! [ Muttering Spanish ] [ Native Americans whooping ] - [ Speaking Spanish ] - [ Guns firing ] How are you named? - How are you named? - Riva. Riva. You live with the bad mexicanos. Why is this? A week ago, these renegadosraided my father's rancheria. My father they killed. Me, they brought here. Mexicanomaidens have many clothes and jewels. I have nothing but what you see. I think you are not without great riches. Look, fine mexicanoweapons. Aye, you can sell her to the americanos. $200, maybe $300. Riva has no love in her heart for the americanos. She wishes to remain with the bad apaches. That venison would taste better if it were cut into steaks - and pan fried. - [ Chuckles ] Now, that's where you're plum wrong, judge. There ain't nothing tastier than venison that's well pine-smoked. [ Laughs ] How long before grub's on, Arizona? Pretty soon, Luke, pretty soon. Better rush her along. My belly feels like my throat's been cut. How about you, judge Bolton? This mountain air certainly wets the appetite, Mr. Fargo. I imagine I shall do full justice to the venison, pine-smoked notwithstanding. [ Galloping ] Arizona: Company coming, Luke. Quick, get your rifle, Mr. Fargo. You won't be needing that pea-shooter, judge. That fine-looking Indian in the lead is mangas. Chief of the mimbreno apaches, and an old friend of mine. I hope he remembers your friendship. Good to see you, mangas. It warms my heart to talk to my friend Fargo. I have fine trade goods in my wagon. I see you have no elk hides to trade. Why is this? Bad mexicanosstole our horses. We bring them back. They will steal no more horses. I see you've brought back a fine-looking filly too. Her name is riva. She has much courage. She tried to shoot me. Fargo: Lucky thing for you that three layers of buffalo hide would stop a shotgun blast. To be killed by a woman would bring great shame to my family. Be dark in a little while, mangas. Better camp alongside of my outfit here, and have a little grub. They'll be over here pretty quick, Arizona. Better start carving on some of this meat. [ Chuckles ] You bet, Luke. Carving wide and plenty. Mr. Fargo, that young woman was a prisoner. Yeah, and a flaming beauty too. Do you mean that Indian's gonna take her for a wife? Well, not exactly. You see, judge, the apaches and the mexicanos have been at war for over 50 years. They don't steal each other's women. They either keep them, or else they sell them. Sell them? Sell them to whom? We Americans are their best market. These gals end up in saloons, - and dance halls, and-- - why, that's slavery. Slavery of the worst kind. I know, judge. Any kind of slavery is bad. We Americans would like to take the apaches' land, and move them on government reservations. That's slavery. And down south, there's another kind of slavery that President Lincoln wants to do something about. I know, Mr. Fargo, but for a primitive savage to take a white girl. I've known mangas for a long time. To my knowledge, he's never lied, and he's never gone back on his word. That's more than can be said about a lot of civilized whites in the territory. No, judge, I wouldn't go calling mangas no primitive savage. I think Fargo the americano will try to buy you from me. You would like that? Perhaps he will treat me with kindness. [ Laughing ] Fill up your bellies, amigos, while you can get it. Mexicanoscrave their coffee. I'll give you a bag to take along for her. Gracias, senor. Mr. Fargo, I'd like a few words with mangas. I'm not one to beat about the bush. I speak straight from the shoulder. A forked tongue is an evil thing. Mr. Fargo has told you Washington has appointed me federal judge in this territory. My headquarters will be in silver city. Therefore, I'm taking this opportunity of making the position of the United States government crystal clear, so that there will be no future misunderstanding. So long as the apaches adhere strictly to the terms of the peace treaty, I shall personally see to it that they're afforded every protection, but if the apaches break that treaty, I shall order my soldiers to punish them with the utmost severity. I want you to understand this. Hear me. The apaches will not be the first to break this peace paper, but they will keep the peace only so long as your people do not break it. My people will not break it. In the land of the apaches, your soldier coats number less than 2,000. If my war drums sound, more than 5,000 apache warriors will take the war trail against you. This is something the man from Washington should understand. Clem, hit that guitar! Make it mex, in honor of the little gal here. Judge, palaver's over. You better go sit down while you still got your hair. [ Guitar playing ] "Cielito lindo." You ought to know that. [ Hums ] [ Singing "cielito lindo ] Yahoo! Clem, "Mexican hat dance." [ "Mexican hat dance" playing ] [ Laughing ] I never knowed Luke was such a fancy stomper. [ Music stops ] First time I ever knowed you to go hog wild over a woman, Luke. First time I ever saw a woman I wanted for my wife. How the devil did that Indian know the number of soldiers I've got in the territory? [ Chuckles ] Shucks, judge. It's gotten out here so you can't cut your whiskers without them apaches knowing about it. Man from Washington make big talk. All foolish. I think he will ask Washington for more soldier coats. Here's riva's coffee, and some blankets. I figured she might get cold sleeping on the ground. This here is one of them new repeating rifles. It sells for $250 in Denver. You don't need any powder, percussion cap, or ramrod. It shoots five times faster than a muzzle-loader. Ayee, this is a very fine gun. I'll trade you this fine gun and 100 cartridges, even trade for riva here. I want her for my wife. Ooh, that is a very good trade. Take it, mangas. Your moccasins walk the long trail. A wife would be a big burden to you. No, I figure riva wouldn't bellyache for me to settle down and build her a house. Where my moccasins tread, hers would tread also. You are my friend. There are many things I would do for you, but I will not sell you riva. Soon bring your trade wagons to my village. Good luck to you, riva. Vaya con dios, senor. You are very foolish, mangas. Mexicana maidens are not hard to catch. This one has much courage. How about some more flapjacks? These are mighty tasty flapjacks, Arizona. Well, thank you, judge. [ Whooping ] Fine friend he is. Eats your food and rides off without a word. An apache never says goodbye. Just goes away. Ayee, mangas! - Ayee, mangas! - Mangas! Ayee, mangas! Ayee, ayee! Ayee! Mangas has brought back the horses. Also scalps. And a mexicanowoman. This is your home. First, you must dig yourself a bed. Like this. Among the apaches, the women do the work. Warriors, the hunting and fighting. Dig. Nona, while I was gone, did any warrior find favor in your eyes? Dalgadito, gray lobo, and yellowtail. Nona talks with false tongue. This is my cousin, yellow moon. Her child, little owl. This is my sister nona. Her name is riva. These fine blankets are for me? They belong to riva. She is only a mexicanowoman! Why should she have them? Hear me. You will treat riva with kindness. Also, you will watch to see that she does not escape. Will you keep her? Or will you sell her to the americanos? Riva is to be my wife. Mangas, an apache has never honored a mexicanowoman by making her his wife. There will be many of our people who will set their faces against this marriage. Will the face of ponce be turning against me? Ponce was once the friend of mangas. Tonight, at the council fire, I will tell my people of my decision. Hear me. This maiden of the mexicanos is without fear. Her heart is the heart of a warrior. She will bear strong sons who will grow up to become mighty warriors. Soon, she will become my wife. Many years ago, the mexicanos came into the land of the apaches. The apaches received them in friendship, and because of this, soon many apaches were dead. Many more were sold into slavery! Has the mind of mangas become sick that he has forgotten these bad things? The mexicanos are enemies. We are at war with them. When we capture their women, we sell them to the americanos, or use them to warm the blankets of our warriors. If mangas makes this woman his wife, the great spirit of the white mountain will turn his face from US. The deer and the elk will walk away. The Springs will go dry, and there will be darkness over the land of the apaches. Chino is a fool! His words bring no echo from the mountain. Mangas is a brave warrior. A mighty chief. If his heart desires this mexicanomaiden for a wife, I, ponce, shall stand at his side. I, delgadito, shall stand by the side of mangas. I say this-- on the first night of the new moon, this mexicanomaiden will become my wife. I, gray lobo, set my face against this evil thing. [ Grunts ] I, desalin, set my face against this evil thing. I have long wanted to kill gray lobo. I shall fight him for you. The heart of desalin is bad. I shall kill him for you. The quarrel is mine. My knife alone shall answer. Ponce: It is foolish to fight them both. If my spirit walks away, take riva to Fargo. Tell him she is a present from his friend mangas. Gray lobo. If my brother dies, I shall rip your belly. Ayee! Yellow moon: Mangas, mangas! Ayee, ayee! Ayee! Mangas, mangas! Mangas, ayee! - Ayee, mangas, ayee. - Ayee! Mangas! [ Speaks Spanish ] Mangas! [ Speaks Spanish ] Ayee! Desalin. Ayee, mangas, ayee. The great bear of the white mountain, hear me. I, desalin. Ayee, mangas. Gray lobo and desalin are dead. Their spirits have walked away. Their names have been spoken for the last time! Ayee, mangas! - Ayee! - [ All cheering ] Mangas. Is there no food in the village, that you must eat elk hide? I make it soft for moccasins for mangas, which you will be doing for him pretty quick. When an apache takes a wife, he must leave his old wikiup, so today, riva must commence building the new wikiup, in which she will live with mangas. First, you will go to the forest, and cut long sapling Poles for the uprights. Then, you will go to the river, for Willow branches, which you will weave closely together to make the walls. Diablo,i will do no such thing. When an apache maiden refuses to obey, the warrior she is to marry strips her naked, and beats her with his wrist whip until she has learned obedience. Ayee, ayee! This you will push in the ground, so. Little owl will help. - No no, riva must do this. - [ Laughing ] Why are you laughing? Vamos, El stupidos. Silencio, silencio. Ooh! Enough! Santa madre, I will not build your wakiup for you. I will not chew elk hide for your moccasins, or cook, or grind corn. Maldito,i will not be your squaw. I will be a wife who rides at your side like a warrior, or you can sell me to the americanos. She must be taught obedience. Strip her naked and beat her! Strip her and beat her. It is the law of the apaches. Hear me. From this day forth, riva shall do no more woman's work. She will learn to hunt the deer, the elk, and the sky eagle. She will learn the use of the bow, the Lance, and the knife. She will become a warrior wife. But mangas, who will build your new wikiup? Nona. That was too high. One hand width. These are the arrows of a squaw, but this one is the arrow of an apache warrior. Kyah! Ayee! Ayee! Whoa. It's mangas. [ Laughing ] I'll bet you 20 silver dollars mangas goes for your trade this time, Luke. I'll take that bet, Arizona. I hope I lose. That riva's all female and mighty pretty. Yesiree, mighty pretty. - Hand me my rifle. - Here you go, Luke. It warms my heart that you have come. This is a very big day. Buenos Diaz, senor Fargo. Snakes alive, mangas. What are you trying to do? Turn riva into a warrior? She's also a very fine hunter. She shot this deer herself at 100 paces, with one arrow. Big chest, long legs, strong. This is a fine horse, Fargo. He's what they call a Texas buckskin. He's fast and sure-footed. Will you trade this fine horse? Main reason for coming, mangas. Give you this rifle, 100 cartridges, and this fine buckskin, all for riva. Even trade. Tonight, riva will become my wife. My heart will be sad if my friend, Fargo, walks away from my wedding. Among the apaches, it is a custom to give the wedding present to the father of the bride. Since riva has no father, I shall give my present to her. My wedding present to you, riva. His name is El dorado. May life hold great happiness for you. Muchas gracias, senor. Fate sometimes leads our lives into different worlds. [ Chanting ] I made these for my new sister. They are very beautiful. Muchas gracias, little sister. Man: Ayee, mangas. Come, mangas is waiting. Great spirit of the white mountain! Great spirit of the blue mountain! Hear me, and bear witness the blood of this mighty warrior, and of this maiden mingles, and they become as one. All: Ayee, ayee! [ All cheering ] Ayee, ayee! Ayee, ayee, ayee! That is the way an apache maiden gives her heart. Yellow moon has taught you well. I have learned many strange things that an apache wife must do, but the husband of a mexicanohas things to learn too. Apache hut here. You go away. - You go away. - Hey, shut her up. No no, you go. You hear? You go! You heard white man. Shut up and go. No! - Well. - No, no! Don't be afraid, girlie. I'm not gonna hurt you. Pay dirt! Pay dirt! Pay dirt! Now, you just stay right there, girlie. I'll be right back. She's rich, Dutch, rich. Yeah, a real bonanza. All right, boys. We'll stay here and work the gravel bar. You waited for me, didn't you, squaw, huh? [ Yellow moon grunting ] Why you little-- you bad man! You bad white man! Man: Clay, stop fooling around with that squaw and fire that stinkin' wikiup. Now go do what I told you. Why you little-- yellow moon: Little owl, run! Oh, little owl. Oh, little owl. All right, men, come on. Let's all get to work. Clay, ike, we have company. You hurt two of my people. Burned their wikiup. Why is this? Because they didn't get when I told them to. Pan here for little gold, when there is big gold somewhere else. Like US to clear out, wouldn't you? Hell's fire, would you look at them, Dutch? - Nuggets big as peas. - Shut up, Clay. Where'd you get them? In canyon diablo. Canyon diablo. I've never heard of it. Where is it? Ride south four suns, and in the mountains, you will find canyon diablo. You're a blasted liar. I do not lie. There is much gold in canyon diablo. And I say you're a blasted liar. Now get. Buffaloed the critter. Buffaloed him good. Get two horses and spread eagle him. I'll show this Indian not to come around here lying to white men. That ought to hold him, ike. All right, Dutch, larrup him good. I do not lie. There is much gold in canyon diablo. You're doing fine, Dutch. Sign your name on his stinkin' hide. Yeah, I would if I knew how to write. [ Drums playing ] Hey, Dutch. Dutch, wake up. Huh? What's the matter? War drums. Listen. You shouldn't have let that red devil go. You should have killed him like I wanted you to. I got a hunch we better saddle up and ride. Listen, Clay, no stinkin' Indians are gonna run me off of this bonanza. We got plenty of guns and plenty of bullets. Now, you just put a couple of guards out there, and shut up and let me go to sleep. [ Drumming stops ] Hear me, warriors of the apaches. I have tried hard to keep the peace with the americanos, but this is no longer possible. Today, they have broken the peace treaty. I take the knife. I take the arrow. I take the Lance. I shall not lay these weapons down until the americanos have been driven from the land of the apaches. All: Ayee, ayee, ayee! [ Drumming continues ] [ All chanting ] Well, Clay, another day like yesterday, and we'll have about $1,000 in gold. Miner: Indian! - Indian! - [ Whooping ] [ Whooping ] Ayee! Whoa. Give the horses a breather. How about the water bag, Arizona? Yeah, here you go, Luke. Oh, I sure hope they got plenty of cold beer in silver city. [ Chuckles ] My innards feel like the big dry has set in. [ Groans ] Hey Luke, take a look at them smoke signals. - [ Drumming ] - Hey, there's another one over there. That don't look like no regular apache palaver. Fargo: It ain't. It's war talk. Some blasted lunatic must have tossed bear grease in the fire. Get these wagons back to silver city, pronto. Where in tarnation do you think you're going? Gotta go talk to mangas before it's too late. Don't be a fool, Luke! An apache ain't got no friends when he's on the warpath. You'll lose your hair for certain! Judge, there's Luke Fargo. He couldn't have arrived at a more opportune time, sheriff. Judge, sheriff cutler. Who were they? A group of miners your friend mangas had murdered this morning. We're heading into Santa ritas to burn down his villages, and teach him a lesson he won't forget. Mangas would not have attacked - without good reason. - That's a dirty lie. We never saw hide nor hair of the apaches until they jumped US this morning. It was just plain massacre, that's what it was. How long were you camped here? Oh, about two days. This apache wikiup was burned no later than yesterday. Well, you can't tie that on US. It was still smoldering when we got here. I'll get the truth from mangas. Oh no, you don't. He wants to warn the apaches. That dirty Indian lover. Is that what you intend to do, Mr. Fargo? Judge, take a look over there. Take a good long look. Those smoke signals are apache telegraph. Right now, they're ordering all the tribes to go on the warpath. In a little while, it'll be a bloodbath. Mangas is the only man that can call off the massacre. I'm heading to his village now. Not so fast, Mr. Fargo. I'm deputizing you to lead US to those apache villages, and that's a federal order, sir. We're siding with you, judge. Yeah, let's do a little massacrin' on our own for a change. If I lead these men into the apache villages, - it'll be on my own terms. - Which are? Before any attack takes place, I go ahead with a white flag to find out from mangas who really provoked the massacre here. Can't do no harm, judge, as we'll be right behind him. Besides, if anybody has influence with mangas, it's Luke Fargo. Very well, Mr. Fargo. You shall be permitted to ride ahead to talk with mangas, but I'm riding with you. Sheriff, instruct your men that until I've talked to mangas, they hold their fire, unless the apaches starts it. I'll tell them. All right, men. Mount up. Bolton: See something? Fargo: Nope. But it's quiet. It's too quiet. Mr. Fargo, if you're looking for an excuse to call off this expedition, you're barking up the wrong tree. I figure a man will live longer if he stays out of ambushes. I have a feeling we're heading into one now. Hear me. I am Fargo, friend of the apache. I bring big talk to chief mangas. It is a trick to expose our ambush. Fargo is my friend. His heart is warm towards the apaches. I will hear his big talk. Here comes mangas. Now, judge, if you'll let me do the talking, maybe peace can be patched up. Los americanos. Mangas, come back! It is a trap! [ Riva yells ] Forward, men! [ Whooping ] [ Guns firing ] Split up! Split up! Split up, men! Take the back trail! [ Yells ] [ Yells ] Riva! Fargo. Ayee! [ Chanting ] Drink. [ Coughs ] It is tizwin. Very strong, but will make the pain easier to bear. Drink. Senorfargo, you know the apache arrow is made so that when the shaft is pulled out, the barbed head remains in the wound? I know. You'll have to push it clear through, and out my back. Bite. Hard, senor. Nona. [ Chanting ] The wet horse hide. Maldito!would you poison the wound?! Mexicanodevil she lobo. Oh, vamos, vamos! Ayee, ayee. Your hands are gentle and tender. Yet, there is a strong wildness in you. A lust to kill. I find this very hard to understand. My father was a mexicano, but my mother was a full-blooded comanche. You're the most beautiful woman I've ever known. Chino is very angry. He is a fool. Estupido. He was throwing red dust in senorfargo's wound. He wouldn't quit, so riva tossed him out. She's quite a woman. You caused me much trouble. When riva told me you refused to raise your hand against her, it made me warm in here. But there is also anger in my heart, because you tried to draw me into a trap. I set no trap for my friend, mangas. And there would not have been any fighting if one of your warriors had not killed the man from Washington. Los americanos were riding in to kill mangas. - Ponce had to shoot. - It was a misunderstanding. A quick shot, and then it's too late. The damage is done. There was seven americanoskilled by the river. Why was this? They beat yellow moon. They wounded little owl. They burned their wikiup. Delgadito wanted to kill the americanos, but mangas would not break the peace. Alone I went to the americanos. I told them they would find much gold in canyon diablo. They called me a liar. They did this to mangas. Leader of the apache nation. And now mangas must hide those shameful scars from his people. The people have named him mangas coloradas. Red sleeves. These things I must endure because of your people. You should have gone to the man from Washington. Then he could have punished the bad americanos. Peace would not have been broken. Americanopunish his own people for doing bad things to the apaches? This would be a big thing to see. It will be very hard to make the americanos listen to words of peace now. Peace words of your people are written on the wind. They are not to be trusted. I close my ears to them. Soon you will be driven from the land of the apaches. See that you take good care of riva. Vaya con dios, senor. All right, teal, off and on. I'm all tired out. Don't reckon we'll ever catch that chief red sleeves. Maybe not, but the major's orders is to keep looking. You sure major Fargo wants to find him? I hear tell he used to be a very good friend of chief red sleeves. He was, and he still is. Just the same, he'd kill him if he ever caught him in his sights. All right, men, mount up. [ Yells ] [ Whooping ] I feel the wound is big. And close to your heart, mi querido. We must take him to chino. No, chino would kill him. We must take mangas to an americano medicine man. [ Sighs ] Ain't nothing doing here, Abe. So I think I'll go on back and see how Mary's coming along. Okay. [ Moaning ] Oh, Johnny, I'm frightened. Don't leave me, Johnny. Don't leave me. I'm staying, Mary, honey. I'm staying. The pains are coming closer together. It won't be much longer now, Johnny. [ Whistles ] [ Screaming ] Where is the americano medicine man? I am the one you seek. My husband has a bullet in his chest. Medicine man, heal my wound, and no harm will come to your people. But if my spirit walks away, my warriors will kill all of you. And you, senormedicine man, I shall have staked out over an ant hill. I will do what I can for your husband. Bring him to my shack. Rawhide, I'll need you. [ Mary moaning ] The breast bone is shattered. The bullet is lodged very close to the heart. I will do what I can. The result will lie in the hands of almighty god. Whisky and opium. [ Shrieks ] - To the dull the pain. - [ Sobbing ] Drink this. All of it if you can. - [ Moaning ] - Doc, you've gotta help. Rawhide, give her your arm to pull up on. [ Sobbing ] One must hold his legs, one his shoulders. Bite on this. Hold him tight. Mi querido. Mi querido. Help the woman. Press this gauze to the wound. You've got to help US all you can. [ Sobbing ] [ Slapping ] - [ Baby crying ] - It's a boy! A man child. [ Sobbing ] Troop, halt! Lieutenant, in case I run into trouble, rush the village and do your best to save the inhabitants. Yes, sir. Good luck, sir. - It is another trap. - No. It is Fargo, the friend of mangas. We will listen to the words he brings. Take me to mangas coloradas. How bad is his wound? He will live to fight again. Fargo wears the soldier coat. Why is this? There is a big war on now that divides my people. Many americanoshave become soldiers. Senorfargo will also ride away to the big war? Later, perhaps, but right now, Washington has ordered me to kill apache warriors, and bring the women and children to fort Stanton, unless the apaches throw down their weapons and move onto government reservations. On a reservation, an apache warrior will be as an eagle with broken wings. But you would be given food, blankets, sheep to raise, corn to grow. You would live in peace. It is not for Washington to tell the apache where they may live. Here is our home-- the spirit land of our fathers. We will fight or die to keep it. With me are many soldiers. They greatly outnumber your warriors. But we hold the lives of many americano prisoners. Then you propose to trade the lives of these people for safe passage for you and your warriors? I promised your medicine man that if my spirit did not walk away, no harm would come to his people. I do not break a promise. I do not lie. I have nothing to trade with your soldier coats but wounds and death. Arizona. My compliments to lieutenant Roberts. Advise him that I have arranged a temporary truce with the apaches, and that I will personally escort them through his line. Yes, sir, major. This truce will soon be finished, mangas. If you go deep into your mountains, it would be very hard for me to track you down. You are as a brother, Fargo. If someday, Washington has leaders who do not speak of reservations for the apaches, and whose eyes also see the apache as a brother, and not as a man-wolf, then bring those leaders to me. I will speak again of peace. Military etiquette calls for the troup to present sabers. Hell's fire, lieutenant. Don't draw no sabers. You'll start a bloody massacre. I think that might be good advice, sergeant. Seems I'm always saying "goodbye." Vaya con dios, amigo Mia.
