Katie: Today, on "the kitchen," grilled steak and portobello mushrooms loaded with flavor. The butter, the ginger, the soy -- I taste everything. A sweet spin on potato salad. Jeff: A classic strawberry shortcake gets a grilled twist with "the brady bunch's" eve plumb. That really adds a lot of tang. Yeah? Really just, m-ow!. Katie: Plus, it's tool takedown, summer edition. On your marks, get set, tool takedown! Jeff: And we've got tasty new mixings to up your lemonade game. Katie: We're all about trends and tricks today on "the kitchen." [ cheers and applause ] hello, and welcome to "the kitchen," everybody! Yeah! [ cheers and applause ] how's everybody doing today? Feeling good. It's hot out here! Yeah, it is hot. Whoo! Jeff or gz? Yeah, I -- it's hot, but we're coping. We have some water. Yep. We have meat. -I love this weather. I think this is what it's all about. It's adapting to each season, and cooking for each season, too. We're feeling the heat, and you will be, too, because today's show is jam-packed with sizzling, sizzling new tips and tricks to make your best dishes yet. Yeah. We are sizzling, literally. Yeah, it's hot out here. Sunny, what's your hot, hot, hot new trick? My trick is, make some umami butter, y'all! Ooh! Umami. We know about umami. You know, for a while, the word "umami" was just, like, "please, everyone, stop saying it." yeah. Yeah, maple syrup is umami, you know what I mean? But it has a place, because it's that unspoken, unflavor, un-thing that actually adds something. And that's what umami is. It's that six or seventh... Extra. It's that's extra something. I'm gonna make my grilled london broil and portobello mushrooms. Very simple. -Wow! So, you know when you go to the grocery store, in the produce section, they'll have, like, that mix? You can get, like, the oyster mushrooms, shiitake, baby bellas... -Sometimes, it's cut too, right? -...The chanterelle. Sometimes, they're even cut down for you. Get them into a pan with a little bit of oil, and you're gonna saute them down, then season with salt and pepper. And that's gonna start our umami butter. So, I'm gonna get that, here, into our food processor with some butter. That's gonna get all blitzed in there, nice and yummy. Now, in the same pan that I rendered them down, I'm gonna add in some flavor. Alright. So, this is actually what I love to put on my edamame that I get from the freezer without the mushrooms. So, if you're love with edamame, do everything and stop before you throw the mushrooms down. But in here, I've got just some ginger that you grate, some garlic, some red chili flakes. I like to add in some lemon juice, some fish sauce, which has great umami in it. Just a little goes a long way. Some lemon zest, as well. And then, I just kind of like to move it around. You know that the word "umami," in japanese, translates to "delicious." ooh, mommy! No. No, katie, deliciousness! Deliciousness? -Deliciousness. -I put a little bit of olive oil just to make it move around a little bit. -Golly. -Here, you want to take this? Yeah. So, what I'm gonna do is get half of this, so you can follow, into our food processor to provide some flavor. Wow. And then, the rest of it, gz, if you don't mind slathering my london broil with it. So, to continue making the umami butter, some cilantro and some lemon zest. Come in with a little bit of black pepper. And I mean, a good compound butter goes a long way, man. It could also just be spread on some bread, you know what I mean? -Heck, yeah! -After you toast it on the grill. Finish your pan sauce with it. Ooh, look at that. Okay. Wow. And then, just blitz away. You could put this butter on a potato. You could this butter... -Yeah. ...Just as a base for a pasta -- like, a fresh... How about a fried egg with this? -Exactly. -Oh, dude! So, right now, I'm just gonna put some of this right into a little pan, so I can melt it down, but the rest, you could store this in the freezer. Gz, one time, we were talking about making some compound butter. Compound. I still have a lot of it in the freezer -- plastic bag, just push the air out and it's good to go. Alright. Gz, you got that for me? Got that. So, just wrap that up, and then, I'm gonna get it onto the grill. And it looks like this after it's been hanging out for a minute. I mean, you know it's gonna be good when it smells so good and nothing has been thrown on the grill yet. Yeah, I'm telling you. Right? Katie: Really packing all that flavor into the meat. And the compound butter is such a great way to really add an intense flavor. It really, really truly is. This hung out in the fridge for about 4 hours, and you bring it out for 2 hours to get room temperature... -Yes. -...So it's a total of 6 hours. You can pat it dry a little bit. But it's looking really, really good. I'm just gonna get it onto the grill. Look at that big ole meaty cut. Ah! Jeff: A london broil. Right on. Deliciousness. Alright. Let me wash my hands really quick. You don't see a lot of london broils these days. -No, you don't. -No. No, you don't. Let's take it back, single-handedly, here on "the kitchen." let's bring it back. Alright. So, I've got my pan in there, gonna melt the butter down just as the actual london broil is grilling, as well. And then, I've got these big ole portobellos. Just go ahead, and take the little gills out. A little bit of olive oil. Salt and pepper. And I like to let the olive oil hit whatever I'm doing. I mean, this is maximum mushroom application. Yeah, I just got to move them around. Move them around. Don't waste that good oil on the tray. And then, right onto the grill. You know. Look at that. Ah. And, gz, if you don't mind hooking me up with a nice little quarter slice. Sure. Where do you want to put them? Right here. Oh, I'm gonna toss them with some of this -- put them right here. I'm gonna toss them with a little bit of this butter. And then, I'm gonna get my steak from the back here. Coming right here, with you. And drop the steak while I get that butter off. I love a grilled portobello mushroom. Jeff: So do I. Remember, they were, like, all the rage in the '90s... -Yeah. -Yeah! ...Then, they kind of went away. I use them all the time. Look at that, baby! Come on, london broil, baby! So, you can go ahead and cut it. Six minutes a side for medium rare. Remember, I've got the butter, here, with the mushrooms, the ginger, the red chili flake, the fish sauce, lemon zest, lemon juice, garlic. All flavor bombs, but really, what's coming in there and really doing that umami work is the fish sauce and the mushrooms. And I'm just gonna put a little bit of the mushrooms on the mushrooms to give them a nice sauce. Triple mushroom? Yeah, triple mushroom. -What! -Umami all over the place, baby! And then, stir these up. You want to get those onto the plate. Oh, look at that move. We've seen that. Give them a nice little stir. Yeah. I love to serve these kind of on the side. Everyone get a little umami in their life. And then... I mean, come on, gz. Come on. Katie: Oh, all in one move! -Yeah, all of it. -Get it, sunny. Just get it, and get it out there. [ cheers and applause ] I'm getting this piece, right here. And then, come over the top, and finish it off with a little bit more of that umami. Wow! A little mushroom fire, right there, for your life. There you go. Meat, baby! That's what I do! Thanks, gz, for making your own plate. You guys want some? Yes! Yeah! Have we met? But very, very simple, you know? If you're into a marinade that's super simple, probably pantry pulls, maybe just go get some fish sauce. Use it sparingly. Got it. A little mushroom in there. Jeff: Mushy, mushy mushrooms. Gz: You know, I don't know the last time I had this cut of steak. Yeah? Meaty, right? London broil is good, very inexpensive, and really hard to make wrong. You know? You do have to chew it... You have to chew. ...But there's so much flavor. And you're right, the umami is all -- it's all over the place. Explosion in your mouth. The heat, the butter, the ginger, the soy -- I taste everything. The lemon. This is so good. It's just so light, also. Just a remarkable job on the grill. Jeff: We'll be right back. We're gonna eat some more steak! Coming up, my sweet and smoky potato salad, a hot new burger recipe, and grilled strawberry shortcakes. Hey, there! Welcome back. We're all about new ways to help your summer cooking today, and there are a lot of new tools out there that can claim to help prep your summer produce. But do they work well enough to be worth the money? We're gonna find out in another edition of tool takedown! [ cheers and applause ] as always, we're judging these tools on if they save time, make prep easier, deliver quality results, and are worth the precious storage space in your kitchen. Let me tell you, my dms blew up about one of these tools we are so excited to test today. Katie and jeff, you'll be repping the tools, okay? That's right. And, gz, mandoline hands. Gar-bage. He's gonna be representing the og -- the knife. -Og! -Yeah, the og. The og. The first tool has been sent to me directly through social media. I'm telling you, more than 30 people all in a day. So, I introduce to you the cyclone watermelon slicer! Oh! Look at that! But wait, there's more! Okay. So, literally, this is just -- if you've seen this online, on social media, you just run it through. So, katie, what you probably want to do -- oh, we've got it already leveled off. So, you're gonna level off your melon on the bottom, so it's flat. And then, you're gonna cut off a piece right here, just so you can kind of get in there, and go into the flesh. These make about 2-inch-square cubes, so, gz, give us some 2-by-2 cubes. And both of you need to get to 2 pounds, okay? Wow. Let's go. The first person to 2 pounds, obviously, wins, but this isn't about brevity! This is about getting it right, and seeing if the tool works. Katie? -I'm ready. Gz? On your marks, get set, tool takedown! [ cheers and applause ] okay, katie has already got hers in. Good job. Katie is going in. Gz is taking the rind off, so he can get into just the flesh. And katie is already making a real good run of it with her cubes. -Oh, she's just going back and forth. -Yeah, back and forth. Gz is still getting the rind off, but once he gets it off, it's gonna be a lot faster for him to get these in. Katie is at .34 pounds. Gz, you're at 0 pounds right now. Now, gz has got the entire rind off. He's going in with his 2-by-2 cubes. Wow, that was a big pile. That was almost a pound, right there. Katie is at 1.1 pounds. Gz, .03 pounds more to go! He did it. Team traditional wins. Well done, buddy. Well, katie, how do you feel about the cyclone tool? Katie: Once you get down into the water melon, it doesn't work quite as well. I bet there's a method of going, like, just shingling. Like, kind of going -- starting at one end, and going down and then back. -Yeah. -Yeah. I think once you get deeper in, it gets more difficult, but... Pretty cool, right? It is cool. It's fun. It's a way for kids to cut watermelon. There you go. Yeah. Alright. You guys ready to move on down? Alright. One for team traditional. [ cheers and applause ] alright. So, this is the corn silk remover, for all that seasonal corn you find at the stands. Fun fact -- there's one silk per kernel. Get out of here. Yeah, that's why there's so many silks. So, this is the corn silk remover. You're just gonna take it from the tapered top, push it all the way down, and it's supposed to get all the silk off. So, we've got team tool with jeff. Team tradition, gz. Are you guys ready? I'm ready. Three ears of corn. On your marks, get set, go! Okay. Gz is doing it the old-fashioned way. Yep. Using the hands to strip it with the silk. Jeff has already got one done. Do I go back and forth or what? You got to -- I don't know. You got to figure it out. You got to get the silk off. He's -- you know -- whoa, gz. I mean, you know, I actually usually take my corn, in the summer, go onto the back deck, and shuck it, because it is a mess, like gz has made here. And he's rubbing it off with a moist towel, instead of using his dry hands. This is a good technique. Oh, this one is very silky. It's got a lot of kernels in it. ...This corn silk stripper. It's not working as well. Gz, not too hard. Don't... This is -- this is an outdoor sport. It is. I think a lot of people in the country, they do this outside on the back porch, the front porch, you know? Just like snapping peas, as well. And, gz... A lot of silks on there. ...It looks like he's done. [ cheers and applause ] team traditional. Listen, I don't like to rush with corn. I think that is -- I think the joy of shucking an ear of corn is the methodical nature of it. This is a competition. Okay, I was -- well, how do you feel about it, though? It got the silks off pretty good. It looks like it did a pretty good job. I think it did a great job. I think it works. Like, you just got to go back and forth a little bit. Jeffery's desecrated his kernels. They're actually beautiful, jeff, sorry. Come on down. I think you -- I think jeff won. So, now, this a quickpit cherry pitter. Okay, this is really, really cool, but we've already shown you a hack how to do this. Gz, remember? You put the cherry on top -- don't do it. You've got your chopstick. You push it through. The seed ends up there. You get the flesh of the cherry there. This is kind of similar. So, you're going to pull this off, put the cherry right there. Replace this. Now, this is just a lid I was showing you. You're gonna push it down, and then, the seed is gonna end up here, in this recess, and the actual cherry should end up down there. So, you have to do them one at a time? -One at a time. Correct. -You got this. -You ready? -This guy is garbage today. Look at him. On your mark. Get set. -You got this, katie. -You got this. -The first to 10 cherries pitted. Go! Right as we start, gz is down running. Oh, look at that. Katie looks like she's pushing them through. Don't worry, the cherries do eventually show up down there when you start shaking it some. You can also check the lid, and see if you get any seeds in the center, there, and then you know you're really getting -- oh! Okay, gz has already got three, but some of your flesh is coming off on the seeds in there, gz. Are you already done? What is going on? Are there no seeds in there at all? Gz, I'm paying so much attention to our tool, you have done it on team traditional! Wow! Katie, tell me how you feel? Maybe not the easiest. I think I got a little bit of cherry juice on me, as well. Well, the camouflage. It's camouflage. It works very well, you just got to finesse it a little bit. Yeah, you got to work with it. I've played with it some. But, you know, in competition, it doesn't always turn out. Congratulations, gz. Thank you. Mandoline hands, again, wins. Thank you so much, you guys, for sending all of this stuff in to us. Keep on sending them at food network, #thekitchen, and we'll keep on testing them. We'll be right back. Alright. We are back with the summer's tastiest tricks and trends, but there is no reason to set out the same old boring potato salad at your summer barbecue. Luckily for us, and you guys here today, we have geoffrey zakarian at the helm, to make us a new spin on a classic potato salad. What are you doing, there, buddy boy? Yeah, this is really good. I'm a big sweet potato fan. -So am I. -Right here. Full of vitamins, potassium, vitamin... Just name it, it's in here. What would katie eat? [ indistinct talking ] and it's just delicious. It's yummy. So, I'm making a smoky twist. It's a grilled sweet potato sa-lad -- or salad! Sa-lad, I like better. When you say it like that, you bring it back to the origins, gz, because a lot of people out there don't know potato salad started in germany. Yes, it did. Kartoffelsalat. -Are you ready? -Yes! So, we have a beautiful sweet potato. About a -- what is that, a 1/4-inch? [ indistinct talking ] olive -- [ chuckles ] -- olive oil. Jeffery, can I do something here to help? Yes, please. I see an apple and a knife... I want you to julienne that. -Julienne? -Yeah. Eighth inch. Nice julienne. Keep the skin. Okay. A good amount of salt and pepper. These need seasoning, 'cause they're dense -- a dense starch. I have my grill not too hot. A lot of sugar here, you don't want to pulverize it, and burn it. So, be very careful. So, I'm just gonna toss this a little bit. Gz, I just love all of your different types of potato salad. To use sweet potatoes is so smart 'cause you're right, a lot of people think, like, "a little bit healthier, like, why not?" you know what I mean? It really is, though. But they are. It's also colorful. You know, you forget about the curb appeal of a bright orange sweet potato in that bowl. So, this is the method I use for this. Wow, a grill. Wow, we're all impressed. Your method is just so particular. There you go. What kind of heat we at there? About a medium... -Like, a medium heat. -...Medium-high, high-medium? Yeah, you have to be very careful because you don't -- there's a lot of sugar in sweet potato, natural sugars, and they'll burn. Okay, so, let's make a nice vinaigrette. We're gonna keep this bowl, 'cause it has some seasoning in it. So, let's make a nice vinaigrette. Honey. Goes great with sweet potatoes. Great. Chardonnay and vinegar. Katie: Chardonnay. So, this is not a mayo-based potato salad. No. Mustard. Capers. [ indistinct talking ] you did capers in your last one. Yes. A good amount of salt, but not too much. The capers are salty. Watch that. And I'm just gonna put a little bit of olive oil. But, gz, doing a non-mayo-based potato salad is also bringing it right back to germany, 'cause like, a german potato salad, it's vinegary, some oil, some bacon scallions in there. [ indistinct talking ] the heat that we're in right now, thinking about a potluck, I'd much rather have a vinegar potato salad than a mayo. Mm-hmm. Okay, we're gonna get our sweet potatoes after they cooked. You can see what they look like, here. Alright. We're just gonna take them out. Wow. And we're gonna rough-chop them. They're not, like, mush, but they're fully cooked. A little bite in them, but not too much. Well, that's because you had them over that medium heat, so it was less about charring, and more about cooking. -How you doing, katie? -I'm about to steal one of those. How did I do? How is my julienne? That is perfect. Look at that julienne! Sunny: No tool. That was nice. Go, mandoline! You're the new mandoline hands. Okay, so... I just got to get in here. Get a little -- dip it in there, here. And it's dense, and it real -- this feels you up, but it makes you feel good. This with a piece of fish. -Skin on too, gz! -Skin on. -I love the char on the skin. This might be fun for, like, a friendsgiving, you know? If you don't -- if you're trying to be a little bit healthier, and not do, like, the sweet potato casserole. But it's also quick, because you cut them into those coin. So, it's not like trying to bake a whole potato, and then, come -- then, get water boiling, you know? Friendsgiving, not thanksgiving. Let's not mess with thanksgiving. Gz: So, we're gonna pour this in here. -Can I put the apples in? -Not quite yet. -Oh, okay. -Slow down there, tiger. -Slow your roll. -Slow your roll. And then, some walnuts. -Mm-hmm. -Love it. Green onions. Scallions. -I'll take it. Chives. Oh, we got a little bit of all of it. A touch of salt, and then, we're gonna bring these to the garnish. I don't like to put anything -- the reason I'm doing apples is, this is vinegary, dense, this is fresh, so I want it on top. I don't want it mixed in. I want you to have that pop of fresh green apple. [ indistinct talking ] you inspire us all on a daily basis. Well, that's why you're working out now, right, 'cause you see him working out? Stop it. I started it. Yeah, you did. You did. You did. Okay, then. Look at that! [ indistinct talking, cheers and applause ] now, can we add the apples? Let's add some apples. Yes, a few apples on -- a good amount of apples. -On top? -Yeah. Just sprinkle. Look how beautiful that looks. -Like that? -Yeah, like that. And then, some white sesame seeds. Cilantro. Sunny: I don't know what continent we're on right now. -A little parsley. -Parsley? You should throw an egg roll on there, and call it a day. Who wants to try it? Me! I'm trying it. I helped. Gz: And you're just gonna see, there is so much going on in this. That's a stunner, right there. Especially the apple. Sunny: I already like a slaw with, like, apples, and all the good cool flavors he's got here. And this with a grilled flat iron or a flank steak. -Yeah. -This is great. Look at that. Geoffrey. It's such a unique mix of flavors going on. It's a really great combination. It totally works. I love this for a hot summer barbecue. -Wow! -A piece of fish, right? I mean, this is carrying me all the way through. I love it. Don't go way. We'll be right back with more tricks and trends. -Bonkers, gz. -Bonkers. Gz: Then, jeff takes on a hot new trend in burgers, and grilled strawberry shortcake with "the brady bunch's" eve plumb. Katie, you got a hot new trick to keep your outdoor party guests cool. I sure do. Alright. So, you may have seen the trick of giving your guests frozen towels. These are actually scented, and even more refreshing. If you'd like to help yourself, here. Okay, so watch this. Oh, this is frozen. I've got some cold water, here, and I'm just soaking some cucumbers. They're very hydrating, very refreshing. And I'm gonna just take my little towel, here, give a good little soak. You could also do this with essential oils, maybe some lavender essential oil. Ring it out. Very nice. And then, I'm gonna show you a little folding technique that looks cute. So, you go like this. Fold the corners in. Then, a little bit like a burrito, you know, just fold it over. Flip it. And then, roll it right up. They go into the freezer, and then, you can just, you know. This is nice. Very cool! I love it! We'll be right back with more fun summer ideas. Welcome back. We're packing today's show with hot new trends and tricks. And now, we've brought our audience in on the fun for a little taste test -- a trending new burger, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I'm always happy to try any kind of burger, especially a trend. So, I'd like to welcome -- first, we have marlaina. Marlaina enjoys beef burgers, but prefers other types for health reasons. Do you love a turkey burger and a salmon burger? Love a salmon burger, especially in the summer. I'm with you. I love a salmon burger, too. And craig. Craig, I'm getting... [ cheers and applause ] he's a little bit of a picky eater, you might say. He's a meat and potatoes kind of guy. Keeps his burgers simple with beef, bacon, cheese, and onions. And craig, your wife is a vegetarian? She is. And she's trying, as you like to say, "bring you over to the dark side." I will never go. I'm a jedi for life! Dark side or enlightened side, I'm not sure which one it is. Okay, and we've got linda last, but not least. [ cheers and applause ] linda is an adventurous eater, and she never met a burger she didn't like. Well, I hope today stays the same. And you try to limit your red meat? Yeah. I do. I definitely do, but, I mean, I love a regular, classic hamburger, so... Me, too. All this burger talk kind of... -I know. -I'm hungry. So, we're gonna have you try this new burger, right here. Looks good to me. Mm-hmm. Alright. So, audience members, taste testers, I'd like for you to give your burger -- oh, craig has already taken the tomato off. Craig: Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm very picky. Katie: Alright. Give it a taste. Tell us what you think. -I would eat this. -Yes? -It's good. -Yeah. It's smoky. Craig, what do you think? Kind of earthy. Kind of sticky. I don't know. It doesn't have, like, greasy, you know, drip down your mouth kind of taste to it. But I don't hate it, let's say that. Okay, he doesn't hate it. Alright. I'll take that. I'll take that. Linda, what are your thoughts? I think it's really tasty. It's surprisingly moist. It's nice. -Alright. Well, for anybody who's picky. [ indistinct talking ] believe it or not, this isn't meat. It's a meat-free plant-based burger. [ cheers and applause ] ...On the market, and they're already getting more and more popular. This is something that really got me for it, is that plant burgers have a carbon footprint that is 89% smaller than that of a traditional beef burger. So, it's because it takes less energy to produce vegetables than to raise beef cattle. So, this, environmentally, is a great choice. So, what do you guys think? I mean, give it a little squeeze. Look. It's juicy. -Yeah! It's juicy. Yeah. In many of these, they use beets to give them that red color. I mean, that's -- there's some serious juice going on in here. Many restaurant chains have started serving these. And now, you know, you can buy them at the grocery store, and do it yourself. And jeff mauro is gonna show us how to make them. Alright. I am... Like you said, craig, you know, you can -- it's a good platform for flavors, so that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna impart a ton of flavor. Not just any flavor. We're gonna make an asian-style veggie burger with portobello bacon and napa slaw! [ cheers and applause ] you're gonna like this. So, this how these a lot of these come, wrapped up, right? Just like you would -- your standard grocery store ground beef pre-made patties. So, I'm gonna make a glaze for this, really quick, using some hoisin and soy, right? So, these are gonna be very -- just, you know, fun, sticky flavors that'll adhere to that burger, and give it a ton of salty umami funky flavor on it. I got my pan going on about a medium-low, here, just a nice non-stick. And we can literally just paint this up, as you would. Remember, there's no raw meat in here or protein. A little hoisin right there? A little hoisin with soy. A little salt directly on there. And now, we can take that. Katie: I always have these in my freezer, in case we're making burgers, and somebody is vegetarian that's over. I can just pop that out of freezer. That's very kind of you, katie. I'm gonna glaze these tops up. We glazed the bottom already. We can glaze the tops of the raw ones, or uncooked ones. And we got the heat, again, on a medium-low. You don't want to -- since we are doing a glaze, you don't want to, you know, overcook it or over-caramelize it. Hit it with a little salt, and let it go for a couple minutes a side. You want to retain kind of that interior redness from the beets to get that, you know, mimic that beefy juiciness. Alright, while this is going, let's do our portobello bacon. I've been doing this a lot at home. Starting with a little soy and some rice wine vinegar. Then, you take that, with the gills, you know, a big portobello -- one or two, three, whatever. I like to buy these when they're on sale. You take out the stem. Use a spoon, right, take the gills out, and cut them into about 1/4-inch slices. Okay. You want it thick enough, 'cause it will lose a lot of mass and moisture in the oven. We got our oven on 400. And we're gonna toss these with that mixture. Again, I'm just kind of going with the theme, here. So, rice wine vinegar, and a little bit of oil with that soy sauce, and we're gonna toss them. And then, I got my drys, here, ready to go. Let me get some tongs. So, we have some smoked paprika. We have some granulated garlic, and some brown sugar. And this is gonna be kind of the dry rub for this bacon. And not only is that a ton of flavor, but it's also gonna help kind of give it some great texture in the oven. We're gonna mix this up. Put a little extra salt in there. And I got a little quarter-sheet pan, here, ready to go, just to dip it in, and coat everything. I got a wire rack sheet pan good to go, here. So, this is what I like to do -- just a quick little... Almost like we're making pig candy at the restaurant, with that full bacon, but we're using portobello mushrooms instead. What's the name of that restaurant, jeff? Pork & mindy's, baby! So, that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna coat individual -- each individual piece. So, in the oven about 15, 20 minutes, till you get -- if you like crispy bacon, you're gonna like this crispier. If you like a little floppier bacon, cook it a little less, right? Goes in the oven. I have some good to go right now. Sunny: We're doing a couple mimicking things, you know, veggies... And you guys want to -- look at those. [ cheers and applause ] try that. This reminds me of the bacon at this place called chloe. They'll put it on a burger... Mm-hmm. ...Or on the mac and cheese. -Oh! -They're good, right? That's delicious. But it's not bacon. They're good. Alright. So, let's build this baby. Now, I have a couple components. We have my hot chinese mustard aioli, here, which is some bloomed ground mustard mixed with a little mayo, a little fresh garlic in there, to mimic those asian flavors. I love the hot mustard... -I do, too. -Same here. ...When I order takeout. And then, a sweet -- look at that, napa cabbage, made with shredded napa, some fresno chilies, fresh carrots. Just a real acidic sauce, there. It's all gonna play together nicely on top of steamed potato buns. Oh, potato bun! You know, asian markets, even some standard markets, have frozen bao buns, too, that you can just steam or microwave. This is a great application for that, too. So, we're gonna build this burger. Look at that beautiful. Sunny: Are you guys into alternate burgers? I am. I like, you know, salmon burger, tuna burger, anything like that. And I do really like these veggie burgers. Same here. Look at that -- beautiful napa slaw. Right on top. Not too much, we don't want to -- remember, ratios are very important. Look at that... -That's pretty! -Look at that schmear. -Mm-hmm. -Crust to crust. -Crust to crust. -Is a must. -Yep. -And then, that bacon. -Put it on there. Look at that. Not a shred of meat in sight, but all definitely big, umami, meaty flavors. [ cheers and applause ] -it's cute, jeff. -Alright. Who's first? First off, you know what I would like to do? I'd like to see a little cross section of this, okay, 'cause we spent so much time making it pretty. I want to taste this. [ sighs ] okay. Yes! [ cheers and applause ] there you go, g. Alright. I'll give you the full one, geoffrey. I get it. You want half, okay. Sunny. -Give me half, yeah. Look at this. It's juicy. You can see the juice coming out of it. Oh, it's dripping beet juice all over -- down my wrist. I'm gonna give a comment on the toppings. They are outstanding. That mushroom thing you did... -It's delicious, right? -...It's like magic. It's like magic. Crazy! It is like magic. And it's so simple. -Ah. -Coleslaw is excellent. The spicy aioli is great. You know what? Three things go together very rarely this well. This is spectacular. Way to go, jeff! [ cheers and applause ] gz: Up next, strawberry shortcake gets a makeover with "the brady bunch's" eve plumb. Welcome back. To help with a new spin on a summer dessert is the actress who starred as jan in the classic show, "the brady bunch." ladies and gentleman, eve plumb. [ cheers and applause ] alright. Eve, we all grew up with "the brady bunch," so, thank you for, you know, making us smile for all those years -- especially after school, right, for some of us. But there's a new hgtv show where you guys are renovating "the brady bunch" house, as we saw it, as viewers, and redoing the interior. Tell us all about it. It's amazing. Well, what's amazing -- it's a house that's in studio city. I never knew where it was. I never went there, because it was only a picture of the house to establish, oh, we're at "the brady bunch" house. We shot in paramount, in hollywood, on stage 5, all over the interiors. The crazy thing that hgtv has done is create that house that's in studio city -- which was not two story -- into an exact real-time, real life replica of the set. It's amazing what they've done, because there were no blueprints. So, they just watched the episodes, to get the perspectives, and the scale. And it is literally -- when I'm in that house, I think I'm on the set, and then, I remember I'm not. And it's real brick, and it's real wood, and it's real stone. It's not paper paper-mache, and it's not just plywood. I want to go visit it. How cool is that? Where did they get the shag rug? Know what I'm saying? There are a lot of stories about how they sourced that. Eve, what was your favorite part of your house to renovate. Well, we were each tasked with different parts of the house. And we were also working with a lot of the hgtv stars, "property brothers," "two chicks and a hammer," lara spencer. So, I worked with a couple of them. Chris knight and I worked on the kitchen with "restored by the fords." and I also worked on alice's bedroom with lara spencer. So, those were fun. Well, since we're all about renovation today, I thought maybe you could help me renovate a classic dessert -- grilled strawberry shortcake. [ cheers and applause ] and this is kind of a full-circle moment for me. Eve and I were in an off-broadway play together a few years ago. And she was so welcoming to me. I'm not an actress, didn't know what I was doing, and you made me feel so great and comfortable. So, I'm happy, now, we get to welcome you to our kitchen. You can help me with stuff I don't know to do. Well, trust me, anybody can make this. It's an easy one. So, I'm using angel food cake from the store -- store-bought. Don't tell my great-grandma. It's the healthiest cake you can buy. She was a champion angel food cake maker. So, we're just gonna put this on the grill. And then, I've got some strawberries that we're gonna grill, as well, on skewers. So, I've just taken the top off the strawberries, and we're just gonna thread them onto here. -Cool. -That's a very good idea, katie. Yeah, you know, just add a little kiss of heat to it, bring it out all those natural flavors in the strawberries. And the angel food cake is gonna get nice and toasty. Jeff: Mm-hmm. So, I'm just gonna put that right on the grill. Should I start the -- this? Sure. Okay, so, we're gonna do -- instead of just a traditional whipped cream, we're doing mascarpone whipped cream. -Fancy. -It holds up better in the heat. Yes. So, we've got the -- I can't ever say it -- mascarpone cheese. So, give that a good little mix. And once it starts getting whipped up, we'll add in a heavy cream and the powdered sugar. So, I'm putting my strawberries onto the hottest part of the grill, and they're just gonna take about 2 minutes per side. And then, the angel food cake I've got on the medium grill. And this only takes about 35 seconds per side, so just... Wow, that's fast. You're obviously a food lover, you know, obviously an accomplished actress, but you are also... -Thank you. -...A gifted painter, I'm told. Well, I have been painting off and on for many, many years. I'm mostly, you know, self-taught. And I just sort of kept doing it till I liked it well enough to have other people look at it. -Oh, look at that! -Oh, wow! [ indistinct talking ] yeah, that's from a series I did called "at home with." it was really interesting. And I'm just taking half of the strawberries, and giving them a good little mash. And you can see -- look how much juice comes out of those. Is that called macerating? It is. See, I know the terms, but I don't know how to do it. Macerating is when you just add a little sugar to it, and let the juices come out. I'm mash-erating. [ indistinct talking ] I like that. So, just mashing these up, to give them a little bit of texture, and then, I'm gonna have the rest of them whole. I'm big on the texture. So, I'm just gonna add these to the bowl. Can I be nosy? Where do you live now? New york city. Manhattan. -Really? -Awesome. Yeah, about 9 years. -Wow. -Yeah, it's great. I love it. You can paint my cups -- my coffee cups. Let's get plated up here. I'm gonna make eve some dessert. So, I've got this beautiful angel food cake. And, you know, it starts to get this great kind of caramelized texture to it. This is a great idea. -Yeah. -Brilliant. -I love it. Alright. So, some strawberries. Will you pick a piece of that basil -- or, the mint, and put it on there? Yeah. Basil would be good. Do we eat the mint, or do we just use it as garnish? It's garnish that you can have a bite of if you like. See, you know more about cooking? You've got the garnish down. [ applause ] and then, I've got a little balsamic glaze, here. -Fancy pants. -Do it. So, we're gonna just add a little. I think balsamic and strawberries are so good together. Please do the honors, here, and try this. Jeff: You added, like, no sugar to that. No, you really don't have to add lots of sugar. But you didn't add any sugar. Just a little bit of powdered sugar to the whipped cream. -It's so good. -Yeah? I kind of need a knife to get at this angel food. So, I'm getting a little bit of each business, here. A little bit of all of it, to get that... Tell me how my renovation is. Okay. Wow! The...That really adds a lot of tang. Really just m-ow! The balsamic? The balsamic adds a lot of tang. You've got the soft and sweet squishy strawberries, and then the fluffiness of the mascarpone, and then the -- that delicious, sweet angel food. Hey, hey! There you go. That's a good tv taste. That was good! Well, thank you so much for coming, eve. This was so much fun, to be with you. I cannot wait to keep binging on my new favorite hgtv, "a very brady renovation." be sure to watch. And we'll be right back. Welcome back. To cap off our show of hot new ideas, we're going summer lemonade some fun trending mixings. It's another edition of you put what in your what? [ cheers and applause ] I'm gonna taste test each lemonade, and try to guess what's in each one. Oh, gosh. I'm a little bit nervous about this. -Awesome. -First up, gz's lemonade. -You ready? -Mm-hmm. Okay. Right there, girl. This is it? Yeah. -Sip, sip. -Yep. Jeff: Oh, she's going in for seconds. It just tastes like lemonade. Exactly. I put lemons in my lemonade. Oh! Vanilla? Maybe some limes added in? You ready? Yeah. Vanilla it is. -I knew it! -I knew it! Vanilla paste is my new favorite thing. Maybe a little bit more. I just put it in here, and it's -- see how nice it is? It's suspended. It's actually the pulp, so you don't get the alcohol. How much vanilla paste did you put in there? 1 1/2 teaspoons. That's vanilla paste. It's called that, right? -Vanilla paste, that's right. -Mm-hmm. It does taste extra lemonade-y. Maybe it did that is an adjective. Extra lemonade-y. It is. It's in the dictionary. Lemonade-icious? It got added this year. -Alright. -Alright. I'll taste. Everybody give it a taste. You ready for this one, katie? Mm-hmm. For mine? Yep. I'm gonna give it a taste. Alright. Give it a taste. Oh, yeah. It just punches up the sweetness. It's so good. I love that. Tell me what you think is in mine. Oh, um... You taste it? It's in there. It's, like, warm spices. Ah. Like, star anise? No! Allspice? Cloves? Yes! And, and? -Orange? -No. I don't know! Pineapple! Pineapple! You know, when you go to the grocery store, and you... That's cloves. That's not allspice. ...You get that sliced pineapple, and they always have, like, that thing in the center of the core? -Yeah. -Yeah. So, just get the core, get a couple of cloves, and just kind of punch them right in. Genius. You're gonna put it into your lemonade, and let it infuse for a few hours. You could do it, like, in the fridge. I'll just drop that in there. I'm gonna show you this one, right here. It's ham-inspired lemonade. It is. It is. I mean, could you think of anything than that for me? I expect nothing less. No, you couldn't. Gz: I thought you were gonna put oj in lemonade. Sunny: No. No. But I love using up that core. You can do this in a nice old pitcher of iced tea, as well. Use that pineapple core. Let me taste this. This is silly. I'll be the judge. Yeah, it kind of makes you feel like you're in the caribbean a little bit, you know? Maybe add a little rum to it. Maybe? Of course, yeah. Oh, yeah, white rum, dark rum. Oh, that's wonderful. You like it? I like them both, yeah. Alright. I'm gonna taste jeff's. I like this. You know, lemonade, you know, hasn't had an upgrade in probably, you know three -- at least 3 millennia. Jeff, you put something salty in this. Did I? Something salty. Do you want to guess what it is I put in my lemonade? It's something salty. Yeah. Salt. -Really? -Really! Yes. Really? Chemically, it does even out the acidity in lemonade, and actually tone down that acid, and punch up the sweetness, and kind of, overall, just amplify the lemon flavor. -Oh, I love this. -And this is just, literally, adding electrolytes, so... You want to do about 3/4 of a teaspoon in your lemonade, right there. Right. A couple pinches, like that. Kosher salt, mix it and then, you'll see. It gets kind of, you know, right, 'case salt kind of gives it a basic quality to liquids and stuff, and this will kind of help even it out. Which one do you like better? I like geoffrey's, 'cause it tastes the most lemonade-y. Who was asking you? Cheers. Here, gz. Here. You guys try it. You already tried it. Sunny: There are a lot of store brands that taste salty like this. I could see a himalayan pink sea salt... -Yeah. -Yeah. ...Put that in there. We could do a little smoky salt in there. Smoky sea salt. Rim the glass. Add a little tequila. Think about that. We drink salt in our margaritas all the time, on the rim, inside. This is nothing new, folks. Alright. I want tequila, rum, vodka. Thanks for watching today. We hope you check out our fun new ideas And be sure to come right back here next week for the easiest labor day party ever. We'll see you then.
