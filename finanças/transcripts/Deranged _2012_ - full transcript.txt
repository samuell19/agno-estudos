Un minuto. Hi Girls! Let's party woohoo! Everyone have a good flight over? One of us had an exceptional flight over, thanks for asking. Yes, Silvi here decided that she was going to go and start the hen party already. What can I say I love men in uniforms. Are you going to tell me what happened? I joined the mile high club sweety. No way. Mile high club? Oh God, it's hard to explain to such an innocent mind but, I'll give it a go... I fucked on the plane. Mile High refers to... I know what it refers to thank you. When? Well when she went to the bathroom. Did you not see her face? You're so dirty. So I've been told. With who? Oh the flight attendant. Didn't you see his face? How can you do it just like that? What can I say? Men are easy. Yes, men are easy. Jealous? Oi Mary don't ignore me. You should be taking notes girl. No thanks. I'm serious, the day you start listening to me is the day you get laid and then all the Virgin Mary jokes will disappear. Fuck you. - Oh Silvia leave her be. Look I'm only saying for her own benefit she's missing out on life. Missing out, how because I'm not fucking every guy in sight. Only the ones I like sweety. Yeah but you do like to spread it about a bit though Silv. You can talk. What's that supposed to mean? Before you met your latest squeeze you weren't exactly the modern day virgin now were you. How's it going with him anyway? Fine. Just fine? Just fine. You're probably the next in line. So, what's he like between the sheets? Oh Jesus, it's all about sex with you isn't it. Not that good then. Oh it can't be that bad surely. Where are we staying again? In a nice villa that a friend of my other owns. It's wonderful. How far is it? It's a few hour drive from the airport. That far. It's ok if you miss church for one day sweety, they won't cast you out for it. Just a quick stop girls, the villa is only 20 minutes away. I need a wee. Toilet? Thanks Hola! Hello Look how beautiful you are. Come here. I still can't believe you're getting married. I mean what was it yesterday, Yesterday you was that big. So how are you? I'm fine, you? Yeah, I'm ok. So let me ask you, how's your mum. She's ok. Gabby, She's better Anthony Look, you are great, you are looking great. And how is your Spanish. No no no, please no it's terrible. But you know me I love you, the people the place. And I'm very lucky, I've got the house, the bar and above all the sun. Speaking of the house, here's the keys. Now remember Max is chained up because he doesn't know your friends. I'm gonna ask you something because somebody told me that you're leaving for England after you get married, is that true? That's right, thanks Anthony, I really appreciate it. It's not a problem. Anything for old friends. Now before you leave here you're having a drink with me first. Could murder one, girls in a swing for the weekend eh ladies. Sorry old timer you won't last with those. Yeah well you may be surprised. Listen Anthony, I'm going to get going. Well listen if you need anything, and I mean anything I can be at the house in no time. Ok, but everything will be fine. You take care. You got a fucking problem, you can leave. Gabby who the fuck was that? A friend, you are so rude Silvia. What did I do? He was the one that was leering at me. You're such a bitch. Aww, no harm done though Gab. Ok I'm sorry. He's a friend of my mother's and I don't want him thinking I'm here for a wild weekend. Oh come off it. Do you really think that nobody knows what we're doing. Look it's just a typical hen weekend for a girl that's getting married that's all. Besides if you ask me, he's dying to get his hands on you, pervert written all over him. Anna you've got shotgun. Fine, punish me for being honest. What are we stopping here for? Give it rest Silv. - What have I done? You just haven't shut up. Non stop on the plane, now in the car. Just let me take my photos. Fine, I won't say another word. Told you there was a God. Oi, what's that supposed to mean? Shut up! Whatever! Is this it? Yes, this is it. Man Could you put this in the glove compartment please. - Yeah. Course. Hardly the playboy mansion is it. Don't worry about that, my mother bought it for my safety. You know how paranoid she is. Gabby, we're in the middle of nowhere. Surely we're not partying here. Exactly. In this house? Fucks sake. Relax, it's got everything we need. How many are coming? Just the one. One! One is not enough? One what? But there's four of us! Then you need to share. Come on Silv, Anna has a boyfriend. What's that gotta do with anything? Don't worry he's all yours. Yeah, you're right one is plenty. What are you talking about? Strippers. What? You expecting clowns and fucking balloons. I've still got no signal you know. Exactly, peace and quiet. Mary you got anything? No. Shit. Come on girls. For one weekend only let's not worry about anyone else. This is the end of an era. It's not great but it's not bad I suppose. Bathroom is there. Rooms? Upstairs of course. Shotgun! Be careful remember everything you break I have to cover. Blah Blah Go up girls, don't let the bitch rule the place. Yeeha! Well I've fucked in better beds but it's not bad. Gabby, this door's locked. Shouldn't be. Doesn't matter we've all got a bed. Yeah but why's this one locked though. No idea. I really wanna get in now. Why? We all have a room... To see what he's hiding. I mean he's obviously hiding something right. Come on I'm serious he could be... I dunno chopping up backpackers for all we know. What do we really know about this guy? Booo! Fuck off! Language Mother Teresa. There's a dog outside. It's Anthony's. - What's his name? Max. I really wanna go and meet Max. Girls, keep your distance. He's fine with me as I'm here a lot. But he's a guard dog. Does he bite? Not me, I've known this dog since he was a puppy. My parents holidayed here a lot when I was younger. Did you stay here alone with the guy from the bar? He had a wife here, they were such a cute couple. He was married? He was, but she died in a car accident. Just after my parents divorced. It was horrible for him, she was pregnant at the time. But he seems much better now, doesn't he Max. Jesus, Silvi a scarecrow? You have no limits these days. What can I say ladies, it's been my fantasy since I saw the Wizard of Oz. Ok girls, let's go swim. Ahh yes please. Come Mary, let's go. Are you ok? Yeah sure. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against marriage or anything. But how can you be sure you can be with one man for the rest of your life. I mean one man! You're hopeless. Silv, when you know you just know it. Know what? When you meet the man who fits perfectly in to your life. You will know it, you have no doubts, no matter what age, no matter what? Yeah like that happened to you. Yes. You must feel so good Damn right, she's gonna be happy. The guy's gonna work for one of the world's largest companies. He's gonna be loaded. He can afford to even make me happy. Oh, don't be so materialistic Silv. He hasn't started yet. Yeah but he's got the job right. He worked so hard for it. Well, Michael's a very hard working guy. We always knew he was gonna end up doing something important. You say that because he's marrying me. Well now you have the stability too. Not kids, if that is what you mean. No, I mean the acting. Oh yeah, how's that going? Well, there is some casting for a film... Is this true? Girl you've gotta take me to the premiere. These legs are made for the red carpet baby. Michael's parents know a movie producer and he's casting actresses for his next film. Lucky girl. Reap what you sow. Fuck, sermon time is it? Well its true, if Gabriella believes in herself then she'll do it. Here's to a successful future and happiness with Michael. And to us. To a friendship through difficult years of college and friends we shall be, until the day you die. Friends forever! And may we always have the best sex possible. Mary you don't need to toast to that obviously. Ahh Silv, leave her be. Why, because she hasn't had it yet? Shut up. What the fuck is that outfit? Shh! She should be going to a Halloween party. Oh my gosh that cake. My God Gabriella, I can't eat that just looking at it is making me put on weight. You've put worse things in your mouth. Ahh maybe, but much tastier and far less calories than this. Anna. Don't make the same mistake as me, inviting these two to your wedding. You're taking the plunge next though. Yeah. Anna, what's wrong? I'm not with Peter anymore. Oh honey what happened? Oh, the same as last year, absolutely fucking nothing. What a shame. - Sorry darling. Are you ok? You will not think about him tonight. I promise. Tonight is about fun. To an unforgettable night. That's it I'm done. Me too. I'm just going to take some food out to the dog. I go to be big actress yes. I go to be a big star. You go see me in the movies and you can go kiss my big fat Brazilian arse. 3 years max. Oh come off it. Do you really think this marriage is gonna work. How do you know? Its obvious, she's obsessed with making it and he's obsessed with his career. It'll never work. And besides she's a fucking awful actress. When she flops, which she will. She will take it out on him, and he's idiot enough to accept it. Maybe, you're right You as well. Well, Gabriella lives in a fantasy world and sooner or later she's going to have to wake up to reality. She hasn't had it easy with her parents being divorced and everything. That was years ago. She was fourteen years old and her father left her mother for her best friend. Yeah yeah, and the mother hit the bottle blah blah blah, we all know a good sob story Mary. She did hit the bottle, she became an alcoholic. How would you like it if you moved from Brazil with your husband and your child, and he left you for your only best friend. Maybe, but we all know she lives in this Brazilian bubble. How the hell did you get that through customs? I'm all tits and teeth sweety. Ahh You like, Mother Teresa? What was I saying, oh don't get me started about Michael. I mean how can somebody so bright be such a fucking idiot. Well, they're perfectly suited then aren't they. He's a pushover. You're jealous! Bullshit! You have a thing for Michael Whatever... But I wouldn't mind fucking him... again. Again? Keep your fucking voice down. You're such a fucking whore. What happened? He bit me. Gabriella are you ok? Yes I'm fine! Did the dog bite you? No Mary it was the Holy Spirit! I was feeding him, I don't know what happened. He became nervous or something I don't know. Do you want to go to a hospital? No, it's miles away, just try and find me a bandage or something. Jesus Mary. This house is weird. In what way weird. - I don't know, I'm just not having a good feeling about it since we got here. Look, the dog's fine alright. He just got freaked. Stop talking shit. The dog is supposed to be ok, I just have a bad vibe. Mary, the house is fine alright. Besides, if anything does happen the virgin always survives. Slut always dies first. Are you sure you're ok? It's just strange that he bit me. It was like he felt threatened. Threatened? How? I don't know, like someone else was there. Someone else? Obviously there wasn't anyone. But I did hear something though. What did you hear? I dunno, a cat, a bird I guess. But obviously the dog got scared. Anna no-one was there, I'm just saying its weird that the dog got scared. What the fuck is that? Bitch! Give me my fucking pills back bitch. I didn't grab anything. Oh what they fucking flew away magically did they. What's going on? This fucking nun here stole my fucking pills. No way, you didn't did you Mary. - No I didn't. What, when Anna and I went out to see what was wrong with Gabriella, you were fucking left here alone. So who the fuck was it? You're so messed up you don't remember taking them. Ok, enough! She's fucking repressed! If you wanna get high sweetheart fine, but ask me first damn it don't fucking steal them. I wonder who that could be. Police open up. It's the police. Evening ladies, I've been informed of a disturbance here. That's right officer, you might need to call for some backup. Miss there's no backup, tonight I am the law. I have a feeling that you're a troublemaker You're gonna have to frisk me to find out officer. Are you carrying a concealed weapon? Check for yourself officer. You two, against the table come on! Come on, Miss you too. Do not force me to use my baton. Oh she's perfectly harmless officer Check for yourself officer. Oh, you go Mary Bitch, you did take those fucking pills. Are you ok. - Yeah. Officer... Ok, ok, ok. I want his hat. Oh handcuffs God, Gabriella what's wrong? Oh my arm hurts. What's wrong? Gabriella please wake up. Come on wake up, come on. Gabriella come on please. Gabby wake up! Come on Gabriella. What did they say? - They're coming? What? No pulse, no breathing. Gabriella please, please Oh God! Oh God! Fuck! It's inappropriate to talk about sex with God. Shouldn't you pray or something? Ahh, now you want me to pray. I couldn't think of a better moment. Our Father, who art in heaven... how's that? - Stop it Mary! Am I bothering you? She's dying! Anna, she's dying No she's not, she's not dying here ok! No-one is dying. What can I do, What can I do? Check her pulse. Let me know if it's back. Ok. Yeah? - No, nothing Shit! She's dead! You need to shut up! I'm trying to save her life here, I'm talking to God ok? Nothing? - No! Damn Oh no don't stop, please don't stop Let me know ok! Anna, there's a car outside, you can drive it we can take her to the hospital guys We won't revive her in the car. What hospital? Gabriella said it was miles away. There's fucking gotta be a doctor here somewhere Yeah but where? We can't just put her in the car hoping to find a doctor, the ambulance is on its way. Bad news, God did not want to help. 2 minutes, still haven't got a pulse. No please, don't stop. Keep going until the ambulance gets here. Where's the fucking ambulance? Shut up! Has she taken any drugs? I dunno. You sure? I dunno. This isn't funny Mary! Shut up! Well look on the bright side, at least you can fuck Michael as much as you want. You fucking horrible bitch! Shh Hey! What's wrong with her? Leave her be Mary! Well just a few minutes ago she's talking about how much she wants to fuck Michael. Now she can. You fucking prude! - Leave her be Sylv Leave her be, you heard what she just said to me. Well it's actually your fault. - Mine? Yeah, you brought the drugs I didn't put them in her fucking mouth. But you had to, you always do. What are you talking about? Being such a whore, why did you have to sleep with Michael? You fucking hypocrites, you have longed for Michael ever since the first day of college. But Gabriella beat you to him! You're mad. And you, you were shagging him in the second year, so don't give me this shit now. Don't bring me in to this. Is that true? Can't believe it. Can't believe you missed out more like. It was ages ago, before I even met Peter. But she who is without sin cast the first stone. Oh shit. Where's the fucking ambulance? Where are they? Gabriella Ten minutes. Gabriella, Gabriella wake up please. Thanks. It wasn't enough. At least you knew what to do. You've got some vomit on you. The bathroom's over there. Mary please stop laughing once and for fucking all. Come on Sylv, let's go outside. Come on. Too bad the party finished so soon right. Do you know what happened here? Me, I've seen what you've seen. I think you're a little high Maybe How could this happen? Did you give her anything? No You're sure? Anna I swear to you. The only person who's taken anything is Mary. If you want we can finish this up in my room. You're friend just died. She won't be bothering us then will she. Think I'm a virgin? It can't just be a dog bite it can't be that. What if the dog's got a disease or something. What kind of dog disease kills a person in just 15 minutes. Fucking dog. Did she have any allergies or anything? Not that I know of. Anyway, allergy to a dog bite, I doubt that. I dunno, they eat whatever's on the ground. Anna I think we need to call the landlord. Why? Because he might know something about the dog. We don't have his phone number. Gabriella must have had it. We can check her phone. It's useless anyway, she's been dead 10 minutes. And even an ambulance is too late now. Her mother is going to go crazy when she finds out. That's all she fucking needs. I think we need to call the police. What do you think the paramedics are gonna say when they see her body? I don't know but we haven't done anything wrong. But how do they know that -Well, we'll tell them. But Anne, what if they don't believe us? They'll see the wound in her arm. They'll get it tested. We haven't got anything to worry about. Tests take days, weeks Anna. Until then we're all suspects. Suspects? Of what? Of being with Gabriella when she died under mysterious circumstances. Gabriella wasn't just some girl Anna. She was a rich bitch about to marry into a rich family. The police are gonna wonder why we didn't call this in straight away. I mean you're alright Anna, you're clean but I've got a fucking history. You only got caught with some dope once. What if they find drugs in Gabriella's body Anna. Who are they gonna blame you? And why are they gonna find drugs in Gabriella's body? I dunno, I don't fucking know. I don't know Anna. Ok, calm down. We'll call the police ok. Where did those two go? I don't know What? There's no tone. Anna what's wrong? It's not connected. There's not even a phone line. But he just called the ambulance. The ambulance isn't coming. What the fuck! Shh, just wait ok, where's Mary because we need to get out of here? I dunno. Oh no! What the fuck! Anna come on let's go. - No wait we can't leave Mary here. What do we do Anna? He could be a fucking murderer. I'm gonna come. What the fuck? Did you kill him? I don't think so. What's wrong with you. He was my first ever fuck! Mary please, get dressed, we need to go. What? This bastard's a murderer Mary. He was my first ever fuck. Oh Mary come on let's go! So what now? He didn't call anyone the ambulance isn't coming ok. There isn't a phone line in the house. He didn't call anyone ok. Understand? Just please put on your clothes and let's go. Because we really need to get out of here. Come on! Fuck! He killed Gabriella? I don't know Mary but we have to get to the police as soon as possible. This is by far the most exciting night in my life. Shit! It's loose! It's gonna attack us is it? Hold on, relax, I've seen this on dog whisperers. Shit! That can't be a coincidence. What you think somebody let it go? Can't be the stripper. Let's just check the doors and windows are locked ok. Oh fuck! Anna what the fuck is going on? Who's doing this? - I don't know. Gabriella said that she heard something when the dog bit her. -What? Yeah I asked her if she'd seen anyone, she said she hadn't but there was a cat or a bird or something. Oh fuck, are you serious? - I think I know who it is. Oh shut up please Mary. The guy from the bar Anthony his name? Look he knows the dog, he could gave something to Gabriella to bite her and released it. Easy. Look we have to get out of here. - How? Look we have to get to the car Anna someone could be out there And we've got the dog. Fuck it, we've gotta get to the car. Max, here doggy doggy. Anna Go! Where did it go? No idea Don't move, I'll bring the car as close as I can. No! No look out! She's fucked Oh God! Oh Yes! Fuck Mary move, move. Shit What do we do Sylvia? - I don't know! Shit! Turn off the lights now! And now, And now! I don't know, I dunno! Right, I know what we need to do. Oh shut up Mary please. We need to open the locked door. It needs to be that guy Anthony from the bar. He's the only one who knows how to control the dog and the only one who knows we're here alone. Syl I know there's something in that room. Look the murderer came in through the window. We've got the dog at the door, the murderer in the house then yes we will be up shit creek without a paddle. Mary we need to get out of this house. Look the dog, who's bite if you remember killed Gabriella, and neither of us can drive. I can do it, I've done it before. Oh that's nice, one of your boyfriends gave you lessons in exchange for a fuck. Yes actually. Anyway he wouldn't have left the keys in the car. Well what the fuck do you suggest we do Miss Marple? Open the door! Mary! Mary! I'll let you know if he's inside. Why the fuck did I bring those pills? Mary Mary Shit! Mary! Almost got it! Mary Shit! What a psycho What a psycho Ok, nobody is coming through the window ok, so let's just get out of here. This is creepy Yes it is, so let's just go ok Didn't you lock the door? Shh, get under the bed, ok. Get out! You fucking Get out! Get out! Get out! Enough! Fucking stop! Stop! Stop! Listen to me, please there's nothing bad going on here. They're just dolls You sick bastard. Please, these are my wife's she just restored them for everybody and over time people wanted little accessories to them, there's nothing bad here. But this is a private room! And you shouldn't be in here! And you killed my friend! What'd you say? What are you talking about? You killed my fucking friends! What did you say? You're the only one who knows how to control the dog. What the fuck are you talking about? I came here to check because Gabby's mum asked me to. And when I turned and I saw the fucking car and I saw Max on the loose. It was the right thing to do to come in here to check, to see if everything was alright. Now where is Gabby? She's dead What did you say? Don't pretend. I'm not fucking pretending. Where's Gabby? She's downstairs. She's dead. What? The dog bit her, she had a seizure No, no, no, no, no, no that's fucking nonsense. Anna's dead outside as well, you didn't see her body? I didn't see no bodies I saw nothing. All I saw was a car with the doors wide open and my dog. My dog running around fucking loose. Yeah right. Anna's body was gone when we got in here. He fucking took it away. What? Let's just stop this now, what are we playing a game here or something. It's fucking joke ain't it. What you playing a role playing thing. Well if you are you should've warned me, because I'm not happy about it. This is a very very private room. And my dog is out there somewhere on the loose. Why did you come here Anthony? Look I can't keep telling you and repeating myself. I came here just to check, to check that things were in order. Why didn't you call? How could I, the phone don't work here at the moment. Look please just listen to me for one minute, Gabby's mum... Gabby's mum asked me to keep an eye on her ok. Because she's worried. She's worried about her daughter she's concerned, that she's gonna lapse in to the way that she was. Do you remember what she was like? Before her father left. Of course. She is, was getting married now she's stressed Exactly, but you know what Gabby's mum is like. Look I promise I came here to have look. I wouldn't have even gonna disturbed you. But when I turned up and I saw the car and Max loose then, everything just seemed a little bit odd. Look please, come on think about it. If I was gonna fucking kill you I would have done it already wouldn't I. What was that? Stay there. Gabby! Hello! Go in there and get me that torch. There's a murderer in here now. And you're not even gonna try and stop me are you. I should be suspicious of you too. Maybe it's not him. Gabby? Gabby you there? Should we go? Yeah Gabriella? Hello I know there is someone there, Gabriella! Is the joke over now? What joke? - Hello? Mary is that you? What are you talking about? - Mad girl, you really hit me that was way out of line. - It wasn't me. I don't care, you took it too far with that. Let me out now. Answer me, what joke? Is Gabriella with you? No! What's going on? Open the door and I'll tell you. Answer me first! It's all a joke ok. - What? She faked her death and I had to act as if I called an ambulance and then try and revive her ok. And who the hell are you? I'm the gardener of her house. The gardener? Open the door please. Find Gabriella if you don't believe me. She's not dead. If you're the gardener of her house, why the fuck are you here? It's all a trick I swear she asked me here. That's why I had to cover up the body with a blanket so she could give you the fright of your life. That's what she told me, honestly. Seriously go downstairs, check it out for yourselves. Why the fuck would Gabriella do such a thing? Because you don't take her seriously as an actress. That's why she set up all this, to show you that you're wrong. Honestly please, go downstairs check it out for yourselves. I won't move from here. But please hurry up, I've got a terrible headache. Maybe what he's saying's true. It has to be a joke. Ok, let's go downstairs. Anthony! Shit! Anthony? Fuck! Wait! Fuck! 3, 2, 1! He's lying. What about Anthony? Oh shit! We've gotta get out of here. How? Gabriella, Gabriella! Mary! She's dead for fuck's sake! Hello can you hear me! Go away! What the hell are you doing? What the fuck is going on? Mary! Mary! What the fuck is that? Latex Oh God! Hello again. Hello again. Was it you? Have you done all of this? If any of you ask me to put on a scary face. I could not do it any better than you do right now Gabby? I saw you dying. You were dead. Latex. I've learned a few things from films after all. Do you think I'm getting fat? You're fucking sick. Oh God! Did you kill Anna as well? Yeah! I did, I killed this bitch. I bet you didn't notice that I was no longer under the blanket when you came down right. I know, I am good Sylv! What is this shit? Is he your accomplice? No, he didn't know what was coming. He told me he was your gardener. Idiot! Yes he is. It wasn't hard to convince him to play the stripper. Between you and me, he's desperate to fuck me. What happens now? What you and him happily ever fucking after together? The gardener? And me Sylv? No, both of you die and he takes the blame. He's obsessed with me. You know what he keeps on his house. Some of my barbies and not the ones here. It will be a shame because he can't tell the police how those objects got there. You're a fucking lunatic. No! I wouldn't say that! No! You bitch! Fuck! Looking for this, bitch! Fuck! You are just make this a lot easier. Fuck! Hey come on, open the door what the hell is going on? - Max? Max sweety. Come on baby. Fuck! Upstairs, kill! Get in! What the hell are you doing? She's trying to kill us. - No it's all a joke. Does this look like a fucking joke to you! Look I saw her kill Mary alright. With my own fucking eyes. And she's gonna kill us both and blame everything on you. That's ridiculous! Shit, it's too fucking high. Gabriella? Yes? What's going on? Open the door and I will tell you. No. Open the fucking door! Open the fucking door! Give me the key. You're a fucking idiot! Give me the key Ok God! Quickly, help me. We have to go out the window. Tie to the sheet on the bed. It's too short. Come on, we have to jump. You first. - What about you? It's not strong enough for two. Come on there is no time! Fuck! Go to the car, run! Fuck! Shit! I think you need this! I think you need this! To be honest Syl, I did not expect you to be the last to die. Why Gabriella? Why all of this? You still don't know! To prove you're a good fucking actress is that it! No, to avoid problems! What fucking problems? You all have an obsession with my Michael! And I know you fucked him already. I could not let you ruin my life Sylv! Not now, not ever! Ruin your life, How? Men, they are unfaithful by nature and they don't need any help from sluts like you. What the fuck is that supposed to mean? You were right about Mary. She was repressed, I could see the look in her eyes, every time she saw my boyfriend. And Anna, she had a pathological jealously and now that she broke up with her boyfriend, she could not stand to see me so happy. Especially with Michael her first love. But that doesn't mean that she's gonna. Shh... Then we've got you but your case is too obvious. You are a fucking cunt! I understand. You do? You don't want to end up like your fucking mother. You're afraid of losing Michael, the way your mother lost your father. You're afraid of turning in to her. An alcoholic, and depressed but not being able to keep your fucking man! That's it isn't it. You know how much my mother suffered. You know that she attempt suicide twice! No you have no idea about that, no! But you are correct. I have no intention of ending up like her. I have the perfect husband and I will live the perfect life. You call this the perfect fucking life. My plan is perfect. You can't get out of it. Nobody is going to believe you. Oh God, you underestimate my ability as an actress again! And Anthony, was he part of your plan? No, Anthony wasn't in my plan. I didn't know he was coming. Shame. And the phone, did you make that up as well. The phone, brilliant. Go up girls, don't let the bitch rule the place. And the dog, he didn't bite you did he? Of course not. What happened? You know Sylv, I love chat with you, but... I will be right with you! Sweety, don't do that. Don't move. The gun has no bullets. I said don't move! Are you going to kill me? Seriously? I'm your friend. I'm your best friend remember. Have you killed her? Yes, come on! Fucking dog! Come on. You thought it was real didn't you. It's over Sylv! I had to kill the dog because of you. You killed my friends. Yes. And now I will kill you too.
