- Fellow seekers, I welcome you to mysterious mysteries. I'm the mystery man, Thomas werrington. And today we aren't looking at aliens, conspiracies, or bigfoot at all, but at the tiny little mysteries surrounding us all the time. Have strange noises ever ripped you from a deep sleep? Sounds like someone or something in your house creeping around. Have you ever felt absolutely certain there was somebody else in the room, even though you were all alone? Seems we all know this feeling right, though where does it originate? We need only look at fairytales and legends. In them, we find countless references to teensy mysterious creatures living alongside man. In Russia, they're called house spirits, leprechauns in Ireland, gnomes in Germany, lobbyists in america, not to mention elves, trolls, fairies and countless others. Could it be that there's something real behind these myths? You better believe it. - That is really smart. - Then you do believe in this? - I meant your tie looked smart. You look really quite dapper babbling all that silliness. - Thanks, darling. Tom Thomas. So do you believe there are little creatures living all around us? - Uh. - Just because something can't be seen doesn't mean it isn't absolutely real. Microbes. - I do believe in microbes. Chewsaga must have millions of 'em. - Might there be teensy tiny creatures living side by side here with us even as I'm talking? Maybe we just don't know how to see them yet. - Why is Tom Thomas's father suddenly this obsessed with little creatures do you think? You don't think Tom Thomas spilled the beans about us? - Told him about us, absolutely not. He'd never tell anybody about fixies, papus. - Right, not if you held him down and made him eat gallons and gallons of boiled broccoli. - I feel sorry for Tom Thomas' father. He wants so badly to see mysterious small creatures in real life and he's clueless we're here. - Simka, our classmates should really, really be seeing this. - You're right, let's go tell him, nolik. - Yeah. Verda, catch. - Think fast, toola. Digit, kablamy! - Got it. Verda. - Thanks a lot, fire. - Game over guys. You're missing Tom Thomas' dad talk about secret little creatures on TV. Race you to the office. There's a TV in there. - Fire, just keep it down. Elisa will hear. Quiet, I mean quiet. - Judging by this intriguing video footage, tiny mysterious creatures actually could be everywhere. - That's incredibly true. Look, listen, feel, sense. They could be right beside you. - I feel them. I keep telling professor eugenius that this laboratory is haunted. - If you hear anything that sounds strange. If something falls down for no reason at all. Or if an electrical appliance suddenly turns itself on. - Oh my stars and gutters. - Are you all right? Elisa, come on, don't shred it, I like that scarf. Listen to me. - But I didn't start the thing. An explainable phenomenon- - that's it, it was an unexplainable phenomenon. Or found even the slightest sliver of a trace of tiny creatures. - Tiny creatures, it could've been them. - You can't possibly believe the stuff on this show. - Please give our hotline a call. That's our show. So fellow seekers, goodnight. - Elisa we're scientists. Use your head. We don't waste time on the mystical. Oh no, could this be a tiny creature? No look, it isn't, just a screw, that's all. - So I'm just a screw, am I? - Professor, you know I'm just looking after our little conspiracy.

Talk about them. - I did what, simka? No I didn't. - Come on, just go with it. We're pretending to be your dad's show mysterious mysteries. - Uh, okay, I'll play along. - Then tell us kid, how'd you meet the little awesome beings? - Well, it all started many, many years ago, two to be exact. Those were simpler days. Bedtime was earlier, doorknobs seemed higher, life was good. I saw chewsaga barking at something a little screwy, get it, 'cause it was a couple of screws. Anyway, I ditched the dog and the two screws turned into tiny people creature things. I was like whoa, no way and I go, "uh, who are you?" And they did this adorable little dance. We're fixies. - That's not true. We didn't want to blab what we are. - Maybe not, but you did because I saved your lives. - That's not the reason we told. We were trapped in that glass and you wouldn't let us out unless we told you who we were. - Nolik, you're the camera man, get back to your post. If we made all of our guests tell the truth, there'd be no show. - That is the truth. - What, no it's not. - Is too. Simka, isn't it true? - No, it's not. Time for us fixies to hide. - Tom Thomas, you have a guest. - Katia. - Hi there. - I asked Katia to stop by and give you a little help with your math to try and bring up your grades. Okey doke, well good luck with everything. Um, why does Tom Thomas look like he's going to the bathroom? Uh, that's Katia, he wants to be her boyfriend. - Like you are with fire? I thought we could start with fractions. - Uh, we're not really gonna study, are we? - That's why I'm here. - We're kind of good friends, right? - Well yeah. Look, now she looks all weird. - And don't you think good friends should always help each other out? Don't you? Then why don't we just play and tell my mom that i'm totally the king of math now? - Yeah. Listen, I'm here to help you study not to play around. - She's just like you sis, unfun. - No, what she is is responsible and beautiful. Nolik, you just don't understand anything. - Yeah, what's to understand, except simka and fire sitting in a tree? - Just stop. We've spied long enough. It's time for school. - Ah, but it's fun to watch Tom Thomas try to do math. - Fractions. - The first question is coming your way, verda. Now then, you just take a gander up there and tell us how to fix that mechanism. - Well, would that fix it? Yeah or better, really Polish it. Ooh, I look good. - Seriously, verda? - This fix is simple. Don't overthink, it's not complicated. - I would fix it by realigning that gear. - Yes, that's right. - Hmph, yeah, so what? - Digit, what tool could realign that gear? - A crowbar, sir. It would increase the amount of applied force to the gear. - That's right. Please get a crowbar out of your pack on that, digit. Unclutter your mind. Just imagine a quality crowbar. - Grandpus, grandpus, please can I try for once? - Go for it, nolik. - Toola, help the little fella out. - A plus, right? - Toola, you must remember, look before you fix. - Professor, if you let me, I can fix this. - Better yet fire, answer this important question. - Sure thing. - Demonstrate for us, please, what a fixie should do when they see a human. - Seriously? Everybody knows that one. - Then demonstrate it. ) - That's right. You turn into a screw immediately. I thought you'd forgotten. What with that outrageous prank you pulled on eugenius' assistant yesterday. Fixies are supposed to hide from people, not try to mess with him. You got that? And now it's time for a teamwork test. Reassemble this broken mechanism. You will have nine seconds. Get ready to fix. Start fixing. And time's up. Oh, well that was awful. - Nine seconds, that just isn't long enough. - Yeah, why the big fat hurry? - We have to fix stuff fast. The fixies mission is to take care of every single machine. And the number of machines is growing and growing, which means we fixies must learn to fix things faster and faster all the time. - Grandpus, it's impossible. - No, it isn't, not if you team up and together. You ready? - Can we quickly huddle up first? - Oh, all right, kids. - Ready to go. - Then start fixing. - Time's up. There, you did it. Fantastic fixing class. - Yeah, we're a class, we're a team, we're the best, today! - Knock knock. Sorry for interrupting your lesson there, friend. - There's no need to hide kids. It's just professor eugenius. - Yeah, hi there. Hey, guess what? I've just had the greatest idea ever. - Greater than all your greatest ideas? All right, what is it? - Get ready for our new company repairz anywherez. Picture it, some poor guy's computer breaks down, he calls our lab panicked. I calm him down, get his information and assign the problem to a fixie. The fixie zippy zaps through the wires to the guy's place and fixes the computer instantly. I say, "try it again now." Guy says, "no way, it's a miracle, you rock." He tells his friends, the orders come pouring in and so does the money. Awesome, right? - So professor, then what you really want is to get rich? - Yeah, no. See I only want to upgrade my laboratory. The laboratory of my dreams with state-of-the-art equipment, fully automated, integrated smart lab technology. Once I have this lab, I'll bring to life scientific breakthroughs no one has ever dreamed of, not even me. What's more? Part of the laboratory will be a new fixie university for all the fixies right here. - Yay! Study at the fixie university? That is awesome! - Excuse me, professor, but did you say that the fixies will get into customer's houses in the wires? - Exactly right. - But is that even possible? - Hah, oh, it's possible all right. Professor, you haven't demonstrated our latest invention to your students? - It's not quite ready to show them yet. - But why? - Come on, show us professor. - It's still got a couple little bugs. - Nonsense, we just tested it yesterday and it worked just great. - Oh fine, one teensy peak. - Watch and learn. Our invention will change everything. - Um, is that it? - What? Oh no, my greatest invention is not a boot. Oh, I was looking for them. This is it. Huh, laser shoes? Ooh, at least these sneakers are stylish. - They're sneakers all right, but not for your feet. They're electro bracelets. And with them, fixies will be able to sneak through electrical wires. - So cool. - Splendid. Class! - But, it's impossible. - Oh no, it isn't. Just watch. Right, professor switch off the locking beams please. Amazement incoming. Prepare yourselves. - Beg pardon, professor, oh, this'll just take a sec. - Elisa, why are you spreading flour? Where are you? Oh, there you are. - The flower will help to detect them. - Detect who? - Why the tiny creatures of course. - Oh this again? Come on, Elisa. - But professor, you may be a genius, but you don't understand this. No, this laboratory has mystical inhabitants. - Nonsense. But I did see a cockroach in the storage room. Go and deal with it, please. - Capture or exterminate? - Oh, I don't know, just get it. - Here we go! - Yeah, here comes a big bang. - Oh, I can't look. - Amazing. - Wow. - Cool, you can go anywhere you want like that. - Yep, just as long as wires are running there. Now with this, we fixies will be able to get any place almost instantly and fix appliances even faster. Amazing, right? - Grandpus, it's like, like a revolution. - Ah, thank you, professor. - Not at all. - This thing's splendid. Is this a shower or what? - Yes, you could call that. It's a zero accumulated power purge, zapp, or the zapp for short. Just watch. It eliminates any remaining electrical charge. There. - And you have to do that? - Every time, yes. Electricity is astonishingly dangerous. It's long term effects on a fixie could be disastrous. - Can humans use the wires to travel too, like fixies? - Absolutely not. Humans should never ever play with any electrical wiring at all. They'll get electrocuted. - Yes, as I know. I know all too well. It was the night we met. You had probably been hanging around the lab watching me for quite some time, which could be considered a weensy bit rude, by the way, spying. But am I glad you were there, my friend. Hoodly ho boy, am I glad you were there. If it weren't for you and your stamp flapping skills the poor world would have lost one of its greatest minds. Yep, that's how we met. - Yeah and then we became a great team. - And thanks to professor eugenius our school can be located in an actual working laboratory. - Can we try the electro bracelet? - You cannot. Professor, please return these to the safe. They need a good deal more work yet. Well they look pretty done to me. - There, our lesson is over. Take a break. - All right, the calculators all fixed. Not sure what those parts are far though. - Stop. There's math coming out of my ears. - Maybe, but you haven't actually learned anything yet. - Then you're just not a good teacher. Fractions make even less sense to me now that you've been babbling on and on about them. So thanks a lot and bye. - Well, since you didn't even try then it isn't my fault. - What reason does anyone have to learn math? You see there's this thing called a calculator. - Motherboard quake. - Like you'd even know what buttons to push on this. - Hey, give it. - So how's it going? Looks more like karate than math. How about a cookie break? - Break time for everyone. Here's a fraction, I'll eat three-quarters of the cookies. - I wish someone would come and fix my back right now. - Living shoelaces that tie themselves, what a great idea. Must add it to the list. Don't have a space. Need to gain some weight. No, use paper. Eugenius, you genius. - Man, I sure wish that I had those bracelets. And they say that dreams don't come true. - I don't get it, how did you do that? - Guess I just deserve to get my wish. - Well then I wish for, what should I wish? I wish that I was a pixiesaurus. - We'll have to clamp the boots to the legs so the laces don't slither off with them. Man, I'm smart. - Huh? - Guess one of us isn't worthy. - Fire, shouldn't we really return those to Mr. Grandpus? - Yes, we should. And I'll deliver them right to him by wire. - Fire, you really shouldn't. - This feels so weird. So trippy and amazing. Again. Zippy zap. I'm over here. - Fire, hey! Remember grandpus said you have to use this device, the zapp or whatever. - I feel alive. Yeah fine, I'll take a silly shower. - What? - Got you. That went well. - That would've been me in there right in that jar. Phew. This means that you saved my life. - Well of course, you're my friend, aren't you? - Yeah. - Take your seats please. It's time for the next lesson. Where are fire and nolik? - Hey, am I late? - What are you doing with your electro bracelets? - Nothing. Well, I wished for them and they appeared. It looks like we're meant to be this way. - You give those back. You're putting your life at risk. Fetch the zapp, hurry. We need to remove the electrical charge from fire's body. That was very, very naughty. - All right, go for it. - You're scientists. So I must find evidence Grandma's girdle, look at that. Teeny weeny footprints. This is our laboratory, mystical creatures or roaches, you're finished, whatever you are. - Spraying us? What for? - Zippity zap. - What was that? Just leave me alone. - What the what? Yeah, aw man, I am loving this. I'm like an energy ninja now, zippity zap. - Hey, what's all the ruckus? - Fire's run off with the electro bracelets. - But I locked them in the safe. - This is impossible. - Fire, scaring Elisa again, you know better than that. Now how should a fixie behave when he sees a hum- - blah, blah, is this what you want me to be? This right here? I'm just a screw. Well, forget that.

Oops. - Professor, perhaps you could wait in your office till we have this problem under control. - I'm trying to help you out. - We can manage this. - Simka. Want to come with fire on a wild wire ride? - What? - That sounds interesting. Do you think I could try it by myself first? - Why not? I'll keep up with you on your fixie board. You can pop these on. But fair warning, you won't want to take them off again ever. - Grandpus, fire's over here! Come back here, traitor. They're mine. - Verda, catch. Get them to grandpus. Hurry, fly. Yes! Verda, what is going on? - None of your business. Fire, take me on a wild wire ride. Yeah, all right. Here's your electro thingies back. - Thanks. What are you doing? Zippity. - Oh no professor eugenius, cockroaches don't zap you with sparks. Uh uh, if you refuse to believe in teeny mythical creatures, well then it's up to me to save this laboratory. Mysterious mysteries, aha, there you are. Where is that hotline number? - Super awesome, right? - Fire, give those bracelets to me. - So bye bye. - Quick, prop her up. You'll be fine. Fire's gone mad with power, actual electrical power. - Could we use the locking beams to stop fire? - Bright idea, digit, but we'll have to aim them just right to get ahold of the bracelets. - Well, it doesn't look like the sparks are exactly good for the complexion and frizz. - A mirror in the hand will put the locking beams at our command. Oh, all right, do it. Verda, how are you feeling? - Like a lipstick in a blender. A wild wire ride. I don't think that I'll trust a single boy ever again. - Zappity zip, what a trip. Hey, they're shooting some kind of pew pew at me, weird. Yes, I'm a space energy ninja now. - Digit, you are so clever. I wouldn't have thought of this in Google plex years. Would you stand still for one second, fire? - Never! Puny pew pews are no match for fire. - Toola, just focus your beam onto his other bracelet. - Stop distracting me, shush. - Hi, bye. Zap! - Toola, are you even aiming? Toola, toola! - Stop yelling at me. - This is no time for squabbling. - Let me go. Put me down. I don't need to be part of your goodie good team anymore. - Digit, toola, keep these focused on fire. No arguing. Sitka, come with me. We'll get the zapp, quick. - Don't tread on me. I'm a ninja. - Fire, does it hurt bad? - Yes, it burns. I think that the beams are burning into my skin. Please help me, my friend. - Tell me what I can do. Come here, come here. - Sure. - Nolik, no, don't listen to him. - No fire, that isn't right. - Didn't I save your life? You got to help me. I promise I'll give the bracelets back to grandpus. - All right. - Toola, digit, want to see a magic trick? - We've had more than enough of your tricks. - Nothing up my sleeve. Watch. You watching? It's gonna be awesome. You really think you got me trapped. Think again. - Nolik, don't. - There's no containing this fire. - Fire, it's time to give the bracelets back. - All that I said was that I'd give them back, but not when I'd be giving them back, which is never. Bye bye, zap. - Well, where's fire? - Nolik cut off the beams. - Fire promised that he'd give back the bracelet things. - Toola, digit, how could you let this happen? - We would've had him if it weren't for nolik. - Toola, nolik's still little. Fire must've tricked him, that's all. Right nolik? Nolik? Where is he? - Nolik, my buddy, thank you. - You lied to me. - It was just a trick. C'mon you get it? - What it was was a dirty mean trick. - Nolik, do you want a wild wire ride? - Like verda? Not a chance, friend. - Nolik, wait. Nolik, hey, ah, hide and seek? Well, good luck hiding from a guy who can go anywhere in the whole world. - And then verda was like oh please, take me on a wire ride. - And you know it really kind of messed her up. - Thankfully her hair's fine. - What about fire? - Well, he's not acting like himself, like he isn't fire. - That's why we have to stop him. Alright then, I'll head back to the laboratory. Meanwhile, nolik just stay here, Kay, with papus and masiya? I'll be catching fire. - While I sit and do diddly squat. - Are you really just gonna sit and wait? Who are you talking to, your desk? - Um, it wasn't me. - Is someone else in here? - I was reciting the math problems. I love math. - Sure you were. And was that tiny other voice saying math problems as well? - It's my Katia impression. Pretty good, right? - Kinda, want to do it again wearing one of my dresses? Hello? What? Teeny weeny creatures in eugenius labs. Sparks, scarf shredding? You actually saw them? What's the address? 15 Violet street, this is awesome. That's near here. Don't let them know you're onto them. Hang tight, really do nothing. I'll grab my camera and be right there. - I have to warn my friends, but nolik has already left. - Nolik? What's a nolik? - I thought that you would know. It's in the book. - Right, what is going on here? Out with it. - Katia, sorry but something's come up and I have to be somewhere. - I'm coming and i'm gonna relentlessly bug you until you tell me what's going on. - Honey bear. - Oh? - I got a crazy call and I need to film something. I might be awhile. - Another one of your fans imagining stuff. I wish you'd fix that kitchen cupboard instead. I'm scared it'll fall. - Yeah. I'll do it later. - So that's the story. I was tricked by my very best friend. - did somebody called for an electrician? - He looks worse. What has happened to my friend, fire? Nolik, you here buddy? Sparkity spark. - Thank goodness he left. - Hello friend. I knew that I'd find you in here, nolik. You really should join me, buddy. It's so cool. I am wild fire. Can you feel the burn everybody? - Who's that? - What's that? - It's fire. Electricity is making him freak out. I miss the old fire. - I'm not fire. I'm wild fire. - Shhh. - Children. Why are there children here? Who are you? - Hi, I need to see professor eugenius. - The professor's busy. - Uh, could you ask him if he'll see us? Hello. - Come on. - Hi, I'm guessing you're the one who called me. - Yeah. Oh, handle in the back. This suit protects me from them. I can't believe it's really you. I've watched you on this very TV. Mysterious mysteries is one of my favorite shows ever you know? Nice camera. Does it have like a mic? Let's get down to business, okay? - If it weren't for you, I would have made it here in time. Now, I can't even warn them. - Warn who? Where, about what, why? - It's a secret. Just forget it. - You said that we're good friends. Good friends don't keep secrets from each other. - Wait, shh. So you really saw the creatures? How many nostrils do they have? - Tom Thomas, you better tell me or we're done being good friends. - Wild fire.

Fixies fix. - Well, this fixie is next generation. Before you can fix something, first you got to break it. And I think I'm just the fixie for the job. I love breaking. - Fire, you're freaking me out. - Nolik, you are thinking too hard. Before one can fix, one must break and I am off to break the world. - What? - This is all your little brothers fault, simka. Why'd he have to help fire get away? - It was you who gave the electro bracelets back to him, verda. - How dare you? I almost died and my skin is wrecked. - Please don't fight like this. We're all on the same side, right? Yeah digit? - Could someone else be on my side? - What exactly do you mean by that? - This is my fault. The world's dumbest genius. Where is he? We have to find him. - How about we look there? Electrical devices, inexplicably breaking down all over town today. Street lamps, traffic lights, atms, all shorting out for no reason. A power outage at the zoo made rush hour very interesting while random appliances and power lines began sparking and even bursting into flames. A failure in the city's wiring grid is the possible cause. - So that's where he is, huh? Stay tuned for plenty more on 24. - Hey, did you miss me, guys? I'm backity back. Wild fire. - Fire looks like some kind of monster now. - That's because he hasn't zapped away the accumulated power. - Did you see all that stuff that I broke that'll now need fixity fixing? Repairz anywherez will make so much money, money, money. You're welcome, you're welcome. Yes! - Fire, use your head. You must take off the bracelets. - Say what? My two precious arms. These sparky arm deluxes can do the most amazing thing. Watch and learn. Oh and there will be a test. - What do you think you're doing? I know it's not perfect but it's still my laboratory. And come on, you go to school here. - School's got nothing to teach me. This place is dumb and done. Let's get rid of it and build that sweet new laboratory. - My heart. Professor eugenius, a person from the TV is here to see you. - Oh, it just keeps getting better, doesn't it? - Hi there. I'm the host of TV's mysterious mysteries. Tom werrington. - Professor eugenius and why am I talking to you? - Well your laboratory is infested with tiny mystical creatures. - That's just loony. There aren't any tiny creatures or medium creatures. There's no creatures and there never ever were. But I saw them or felt them. - Great Einstein's ghost, what are you wearing? Did you dress her up like this? What kind of a weird show do you have here? - No, I made this. It's protection, protection from them. - Her ideas are pretty cooky. You can put that thing away. Well, unless we've got a show called ladies in cardboard dresses. Goodbye. - What just exploded in there? - Um, ah that, that experiment, very unstable, very dangerous. Thanks for stopping by. Please never come back. I'm sorry, I'm just really pressed for time. Bye bye. - Something is definitely happening in there. - Hey, hey, hey, why isn't anybody breaking stuff? F minus. You're all staying after school. Sorry professor. - Did you guys catch that? Fire isn't willing to hurt us. So we can shield the lab equipment with our bodies. - Careful, I don't want anybody to get hurt. - Then stop all of this already. - Never! This wild fire's gonna spread across the entire world. Fly little friends, you're free. Yeehaw, random cow fixie. - Digit, come help me. Goodness, just hang on. - Why does it always hurt when I help you? - If this is the way fire behaves when he's someone's guest, can you imagine what he must act like at home? - He must drive his parents crazy. I'm just so glad that our nolik isn't like him. - You hear that, buggy? They actually think I'm good. But this whole thing's my fault. Even that's my fault. They had fire caught in the beams and I let him go. Now they all think I'm a dumb little kid traitor. And I'm a big coward too because instead of helping I'm sitting here and feeling sorry for myself. I need to get off my butt and fix this, go out and prove I'm a real fixie. Yeah, I got to. This is my fault and it's up to me to do something to take care of fire. Well, not by myself but with everyone. Are you scared? Yeah, so am I. But I still have to do it. - Tom Thomas, I'll tell your mom that you've worked your way through this entire math book, that you're the smartest in the class, I'll tell her anything that you want me to, just tell me the secret. - I can't, no. Honestly, I'd rather study math than talk about this anymore. - What if I run and tell your father that we're here? You'd really get it then. So... - Many, many years ago when fixies still turned into nails because screws hadn't been invented yet, two brave fixies decided to reveal themselves to humans. And the humans put them in cages and experimented on them. They tortured them with fire, they froze them, they tried to cut them open and look inside. And when the fixies ran, the humans cut them, and hammered them into the wall where they could not escape. The poor fixies stayed there as bent rusty nails forever. - And that's the reason why every fixie promises to never reveal themselves to humans. - Now swear that you won't tell a soul about us, ever Tom Thomas. - Did that story actually happen? - Well kinda, maybe, but will you swear? - Will you? - Yeah. - Yeah? Tell me everything. I gotta know. - Can't. - You are so stubborn. - Really dad? Crud, this could ruin everything. - Simka, simka! - Tom Thomas, what in the led are you doing here? - With a camera. - That's what you're hiding? That's what your secret is? That there are little teeny tiny people? Don't deny it. Who are they? You gotta tell me. - Four processors, three containment units, two testing racks, and a partridge in a pear tree. Make that three testing racks. - Tom Thomas' dad is here with his camera. He'll get all of this on film. - What? Is there some kind of beehive around here? What is all of this? Well I'll just shoot it now and see what it is later. What? Hey! Giant robot arm, hey, I'm a member of the fourth estate an almost award-winning journalist. I have a duty to fulfill. Oh dizzy. The world has a right to know what you do. I'm not going anywhere, not until you, until you tell me what is happening here. - All right, all right. But can you wait in here, please? Get comfy, dust off your most penetratingest questions and I'll be right in, right in, right in. - Professor eugenius? - What is it now? - There's a bee on your, in the very middle of your forehead just here. - It'll sting my beautiful brain. There, now no more visitors, no more. - Oh Thomas, what were you kids playing? Earthquake. Hello kids? Chewsaca, where is everybody? Great, the children aren't here, Tom isn't either. I'll keep calm. Moms can handle anything. I'm ready. Stop, stop, there. Who's the chicken now? You are. Oh gross. Oh, it's just a little spider. No problem. - All things considered she did pretty well. - She is one tough mother. Whoa. Oh my gosh, oh my gosh. - What's wrong? Whew. All right, quick. Heavy, very heavy. Oh my back. - Good chewsaca, nice chewsaca, help. Didn't know she knew that trick. - We can't let my dad see anything. We've got to stop him. Dad! - Tom Thomas, what are you doing here? - We're sorry. We followed you here because we wanted to see the little creatures. - Hey, don't mention that. - Plus, we wanted somewhere new to study. - You did? - Look at all this stuff, woo. It's mine for the breaking. - Quick, there are people in here. You've got to keep your dad out of the lab. Fire's gone off the deep end. - Uh huh. �� - what was that? Mutant beetles, there are some serious mysterious mysteries in this laboratory. Whoa! - Yeehaw! Lights out. Took care of those pesky lights. They were wasting so much electricity. Smashedy smash. And if I do say so myself, I'm crushing it literally. - We're running out of time. - Don't pull it. Wait until I give the signal. It's slipping. This is better than the circus. And don't forget to say, cheese. - Hey, why are you guys always getting in my way? - Well, maybe if you looked where you are going. - Everybody be nice. Nobody was in anybody's way. - Seriously? You've been in my way all day, toola. - I'm here. I came to help. Come on, let's catch fire, all of us as a team. - Yeah, some team, we're no team at all. - But we are a team. We can be a great team, right? Right? - Nolik, what are you doing here? - Bet he thought fire might need to be rescued again. - Nolik, things have gotten just really terrible here. You'd be much safer if you went home. - Yeah, you'll just get in the way if you stay here. - Fire, don't you dare. What do you want? - I want to break your stuff and then I want to break everyone else's stuff. That's right. We're here with thousands of children who have flocked to the opening of the playdium, the world's largest and most advanced indoor amusement park. There's plenty to do under this- - oh, and it's not even my birthday. When I'm done messing with you clowns, I'm going to the playdium. Get ready kids 'cause wild fire's coming. Just look at all those smiling faces. - Oh, this is a nightmare. What can we do? - Are the doors locked? Fire must, must stay here. If you plug the outlets, he can't get to the wires. - Plug? Plug, plug, plugarooni. So much to break. - If fire does manage to escape, the kids at the playdium will be in real danger. - Goodness, those poor little kids. - All of them are guaranteed to see him. Everyone's gonna learn about fixies now. - Goodness, poor fixies. - Fire's still our friend and he needs our help. - Goodness, poor fire. - We can catch him, We can if we work together, like we're a team. Yeehaw! Peace? - We're a class, we're a team, we're the best tonisch! - What about nolik? - Guess I'm completely useless. No help at all. What did I think I could do? No use, no point nolik. - What's this, a little notebook? And he told me I was seeing things all this time. I'm a little furious. Can you hear me in their mystery guy? There's proof, sketches of the freaky little critters? Gosh, I wish you could see them. Then open the door. - I don't know where the keys are. There is a fire in here. - You do comedy too? Professor, fire! Professor eugenius, the handsome reporter that you locked in the closet is burning! - Children? Where'd the kids come from? - Not from me. - They're with me. - Can you believe this guy? Are your wife and pets here too? - I'm fine. Stop, stop. - Well, I think my workety work is finished here. Kids, here comes wild fire. Zippety, huh? All these outlets are plugged up. And here too. And so are these. Come on, there's gotta be one. One open road and I'm out of here. Ah come on, give me a break. - Verda, over there. Got to plug it up. - Yes, an open road, playdium, here I come. You're too late, team. - Stop, you're not strong enough. You can't do it alone. It took all of us working together. - Then I'll just burn it and I'll be through it in no time at all. No! Must break in. I don't want to hurt you, step aside. - Never gonna happen, fire. Don't worry, he's bluffing. - Look at the team. Oh, my heroes. - Goodness, I can't breath. - We've got to open the door. - Good, the fire's out. I'll just, ah, I lost the key, oh no. - Great. Eugenius, where'd you lose it? - Well if I knew that Oh you're being rhetorical, funny. - Where? Oh, heaven's to Betsy, I'm sorry. - Can't find the key anywhere. - You don't think I could have dropped it in the office? - The fortune teller warned me about this. She said beware of days that end with a y. - Can't get a signal. This thing's useless. - Professor eugenius, you are a genius. You have to think of something. - I'll scream. Help us, please help us! - There isn't anybody in the building, but us, right? So who are you calling? - I don't know. Why aren't you helping? - I'm a big strong man. - Dude, this isn't a movie, this the real world. And those windows, they're made of armored glass. - Swell. - Can't hold it much longer. Buggy, help. - Buggy, I appreciate the help but really? - Who's there? What happened? Chewsaca, thanks, you saved me, you little fuzzball. - Open it. Let me get into position. - There is no way you guys are gonna trap me. Maybe there's a hole in the roof. - Sitka, goodness, over there is yet another unplugged outlet. - Golly, we better plug it up before fire sees it. - Freedom, here I come. Where's the outlet? - Oh, there is no outlet. This all ends here. - Break time, fire. Aw, come on. - Mmm yes, we trapped him. - Please let me out of here. Please let me out, please let me out. Please let me out. I'll be really, really good, you guys, really. - You're not fooling anyone. - You can't get free now, it's impossible. - Impossible huh? Watch me. - Oh fire please, we want to make you all better. - Get you back to your handsome self. - But I'm already better. A billion times better than any of you. - It's time. - I mean look at me, I'm glorious. Uh... - Well, what do you know? I'm out of here. Thanks for the party, I love you all. ♪ Everybody ♪ ♪ eenie meenie miny moe ♪ ♪ catch a fixie by the toe ♪ ♪ go ahead now if you dare ♪ ♪ just beware ♪ - Is it the end? Is it time to say our final farewell? Goodbye dear professor. - Elisa. - You still won't tell me your secret, even now? Guess it doesn't Matter anymore. The creatures you saw, they're called fixies, okay? They're nice and kind to me and they've been super loyal, but I've kept another secret though. It's the way I feel about Katia. Hmm? What is going on? - We can't find the key, nolik. - Follow me, come on. This way, up ahead. The key. - You saved us, nolik, you're a real hero. - Me, a hero, really? - Is everybody happy? Whatever, I don't care. Hey, one more thing, you guys are never gonna win, not even if you do work together. We're a class, we're a team. No, I'm class, you're just itty bitty screws. Still, before I leave, I think there's time for one more big bright zoomity zam. How do you like me now? Adios amigos. Bye. - Fire, stop! - Nolik, what did you do? Nolik! - It's not complicated. It's simple, I turned the electricity off. Tidish. - Brilliant. Why didn't I think of that? - Nolik trapped fire! - Nolik, you did it, yay! - Nolik's the one! Nolik is class! Nolik's the best, yay! We're all the best. - Yep, this team is something else. - Tadisch. - Well, well, well. I got 'em. Quick film them, film them. - All right. I can't see at all through these glasses. - That's enough of them. Film me. All you fellow seekers, everybody on earth. - Huh? - You will not believe your eyes. I have just captured mystical tiny real life creatures, camera on me, I'm Elisa. I've been the assistant of professor eugenius for a while. And in case you're wondering, yes, I'm single. - Really wonderful speech, Elisa. - Maybe I should do it again in Spanish. - And what have you captured here? - Just take a look, spooky little creatures. Can't you see them in there? - I see them quite clearly, but do you? - You've got to be kidding me. - Yeah, huh? Where are the kids? They're with me. What? In our own home? Hurry, kids. - So the experiment that I was running made the table shake, the screws bounced around and so they looked alive. - But who shocked me then? - Not shocked, but stung. You're the one that pointed the bee out. - But all the sketches here, just look at these. - Look at what sketches? - I watch too much reality television. Oh there there. - Dudes, I feel like a fantastic fool. - We're just happy that you're all right, fire. - Maybe professor eugenius won't notice how you completely destroyed his dream lab. - You were so beautiful. Fiend, you destroyed my dream. You destroyed my laboratory. Sadness! Oh my beautiful laboratory is gone. Move. This is all because of those bracelets. They must be destroyed. - No, it isn't their fault. They're only an invention. The blame lies with their creator. - That's right. You're very right. I should've never pressured you to demonstrate them like I did. The bracelets, they simply weren't ready yet. I was just so excited about repairz anywherez. I deserve this all. - Calm down and put down the hammer, yeah? Good genius. All the hard stuff is behind us. - But Tom Thomas' dad still has a video with us on it. Sorry to mess up the happy ending. - While you were out there seeking our house was full of real mysterious mysteries. - Does this mean that you finally believe? - I'm not really sure. I'm just glad you're back. - Check this out. I got footage of them at that lab. This is gonna be huge, Emmy winning. The entire world will see my video of real live teeny mystical creatures. - That's it then, we're too late. - Tom Thomas, you need to distract your parents, real big, real now. - Dad, mom, yeah there's something I need to say. - Tom Thomas and me, we've decided we're getting hitched. - What did you decide? - We're getting engaged because we're in love. - Ugh, oh dear. - That's quite a distraction, you guys. Crazy. - The thing is kids, well at your age, marriage is, it's illegal. - Pretty sure it's not. I'm thinking we'll live at my place. This place is way too messy for newlyweds. - Wow, she's right. Somebody wrecked this place. - I look like a monster. Oh, I just can't believe I did all that. - We have to do something to get rid of that film. - This is my fault. It's my job. - But this is absurd. You're both still children. - How about this? Wait 30 years, then see if you both still want to do this. - Our love can't be denied. The wedding's set for next week. - That's it, I'm done. I can't take anymore. Nobody here is having a wedding. After the day I've had, you'd be wise to drop it. Okay? - Looks like you guys aren't quite mature enough to handle this, but it's possible that we're just messing with you. - Your joke almost killed us. - I kind of liked it. Well here goes. No, what? Don't tell me. I had them on tape. You saw them, tell her. - Enough mysteries for today. The only mystery I want to solve is who's going to clean up this mess? - Oh, it's sad. - Did you want the footage of us to get out? - Not that, I was excited for the wedding. Breaking news, or should I say unbreaking news? All over town, almost everything that mysteriously broke seems to have been just as mysteriously fixed. Lights are back on, burnt out appliances are working fine, our upside down city is right side up again. - Huh, fixies all over town must be working overtime. - It's time we get to work. - Yeah and you sure did make plenty for us. - We can handle it all 'cause we're a great team. - We're a class, we're a team, we're the best, tipeesh! ♪ When your TV has broken ♪ ♪ when your cell phone has croaked ♪ ♪ your laptop's barely working ♪ ♪ the kettle's had a stroke ♪ ♪ don't ask us where we're going ♪ ♪ for it's known far and wide ♪ ♪ that any kind of problem ♪ ♪ is clearer from inside ♪ ♪ one, two, three, tideesh ♪ ♪ inside we'll be, tideesh ♪ ♪ to fix what's wrong, tideesh ♪ ♪ till it runs strong ♪ ♪ one, two, three, tideesh ♪ ♪ inside we'll be, tideesh ♪ ♪ to fix what's wrong, tideesh ♪ ♪ till it runs strong ♪ ♪ in gadgets and devices ♪ ♪ our work will never end ♪ ♪ appliances are fickle ♪ ♪ they need a loyal friend ♪ ♪ at morning, noon and midnight ♪
