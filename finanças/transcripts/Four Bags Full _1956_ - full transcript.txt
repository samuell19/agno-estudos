ACROSS PARIS SHELTER BICYCLE CAB Careful. He's taking a risk. -You mean he's got courage. You wouldn't do it. But I don't ask for money. I give it. You're welcome. Do you take the subway with her? -Is that allowed? Not yet, but soon. -Are you looking for something? I'm looking for Vaugirard. -That's not here. Go straight to Denfert. You'll see a lion. Ask again there. How many ration coupons is that! Come. WINE GROCERIES Look. Can you hear it? No. He must be asleep. He doesn't know what's happening. Come. -No, I don't want to see it. Disgusting. I'll wait for you across the road. That's all I can do. Alright. There you are finally. Light the lamp. There will be a power failure, of course. There's nothing left. Go away. What do you want me to sell you? The walls? It's not my fault. She eats every day. Music. Music, music. It's not that easy. Nothing's easy at the moment. Come. I'm coming. Louder. Open it. Make room. -Ah! Don't let him escape. Get him. Music. Pull. Music, damn! Where's the knife? You do it, dad. I don't remember how. -Just try it. I did remember how. Stop. It's enough now. I'll pick it up at 8 o'clock. It's a beautiful animal, isn't it? -It was. At least a 100 kilos. -You won't have to carry it around. L?tambot will come with you. He's strong. Not stronger than me. What were you thinking? Cheers! Hello. How are you? That's all I needed. L?tambot was caught. With a suitcase... Hello Mrs. Mariette... full of soaps. Take this. I tried it. It's good. -Keep it if you like. Thank you. -In memory of L?tambot. What are you having? -The same as him. L?tambot was here, with his suitcase wide open. I said: "Close it. There's a fellow here I don't know." He closes it. The guy asks for a calvados. I tell him no alcohol today. He orders nothing else and looks at his hands. "Have you got a bit of soap, so I can wash my hands?" He didn't even have dirty hands. Not more than anybody else, anyway. So I tell him no soap today either. And then that idiot L?tambot opens his suitcase. "And I say today is soap day!" He thought he was clever. The other man arrested him right away. The police just do their job. Take it easy, D?d?. A dirty job it is. -Isn't the black market shameful? If there was no black market, how would you wash your hands? I haven't washed since France was defeated. And if nobody washed themselves, France would be a cleaner place. Don't listen to him. He's been like this since he was a prisoner. Back to work, D?d?. Do you think the police will clean up France? I mean, it's true. How can they arrest somebody for helping you out? They're provocateurs. They're worse than the cops. They're the cops' cops. Good evening, all. No light? It's not 7 o'clock yet. -I'll have a calvados in the dark. No alcohol. No light, no alcohol. Can I at least wash my hands? That way. Hey, don't you have a bit of soap? I don't sell any soap. That's not going to work twice. Hello. Two soups. It's not warm, is it? It's warmer at the police station. Nobody asked you anything. Do you want to go have a look? -I already know it. Show me your hands Is that charcoal? It's a bit of everything. We're looking for a fellow who stole charcoal from a boat. Seven o'clock. The curtains. Mrs. Jeanne. Pork kidneys. Can you prepare them for tonight? Grilled. -Of course. Here. What is it? -Soap. Cops came in. Thank you. They're looking for someone with dirty hands. Someone like me? Wait. -What? Turn around. That's it. -Thank you. Now you're clean. Well? I told Mrs. Jeanne to grill them. -Grill what? The kidneys. -Ah yes, the kidneys. Let's eat and then go to the cinema. -The cinema? You're working tonight. I want to go to the cinema, because I'm not working tonight. You're not going to Jambier's house? -No. I can't carry a 100 kilos of pork on my own. Are you looking for someone to replace L?tambot? No, I don't work with strangers. Tonight, I stay with my wife. How much is it? -I'm coming. I couldn't know, Marcel. I'm going out tonight. Out? Out? -Since you had to work... When I work, you go out... Very well organised. You're so stupid. Can I know where the lady's going tonight? Excuse me. A coffee. -Cold, no? No, very hot. -I meant outside. I was talking about the coffee. Very hot. Could I get the soap back? Now that your hands are clean? Is it yours? -Everything that belongs to her is mine. Well then... Thank you, madam. You're welcome, sir. That's enough, Mariette. Any other guy would already have smacked you. You're going too far, Marcel. -Alright, I take back the smacking. But if you go through that door without me, you won't see me again. That sounds too good to be true. Rub your arm. Nobody's looking. You can't complain. I may not take you to the cinema all the time, but we have food every day. And when it comes to feelings and all, try to find a better man. What are you thinking? As if I can't find a passionate man. I'll have plenty to choose from. -And you choose them in the bathroom? Did you think I didn't see you two? Here. Well done. Alright. Get lost. I've had enough of you. I mean, really... That settles that. Keep working, D?d?, keep working. Mariette. Mariette. Mariette. No reason to make us freeze. I don't care. Bye. -Thanks. Are you leaving? -Looks that way, yes. Where are you going? -Well... Wait a minute. I want to talk to you. I'm listening. It's rather confidential. Would you like a drink? -Yes. A white wine? A white wine. -Two white wines. Let's see. Are you doing anything tonight? Tonight, yes. -Of course. Why "of course"? -It's a shame. Why? -Why? I had something for you. What? Three hundred francs. See? You could make time. And would it last all night? -All night. Is it hard? -You're strong. Fairly strong. There's a small risk. Why do you ask me? Why did you wash your hands? What does that have to do with it? -Nothing. Do you like kidneys? I still don't see the point. -There is no point. Dinner together? Why not. The kidneys are for Mr. Martin. Let's eat. This will be bad. Pork kidneys. Yes. That gentleman brought them. Where did you get them? From a pig. Are there still pigs? Do you have a glass of wine? -Red. Five francs. Give me some water. Was it you who stole the charcoal? It's dirty and hard work. Not my thing. So what do you do for a living? I'm a painter. So you're kind of unemployed, of course. There's not a lot of work at the moment. Veal kidneys are better then pork kidneys. Two turnips. Hurry. The last time is a year ago. At my sister's, at the C?te d'Or. Prepared with red wine. -For me, it's longer ago. It was in the Halles. During my leave. Do you remember? Where are the kidneys now? -The Germans eat them, of course. They have every right. Kidneys for the victors. I feel like some human kidney, right now. A fish p?t?. Two turnips. Hurry. Look at me... Before the war, I was a cab driver. I could be unemployed too. You let yourself go. I don't. And if you let yourself go, you can forget about women. Oh... women... Don't act all innocent. I saw you with my wife. Are you insane? I had dirty hands and she gave me soap, that's all. If I was polite, I'd say your wife's attractive. But I'm not polite and I don't find her attractive. At your age and with the way you look... She's not my type. I don't mean to offend you, but... You? Offend me? That shows how wrong one can be. I thought you were going to meet her. Is that why you invited me for dinner? Yes, so you wouldn't go. You thought I liked kidneys better than your wife? You thought I looked hungry? -Yes, quite. Now that you had a good dinner, let's leave it at that. The suitcases are heavy. And dangerous. You shouldn't have told me. So we agree? -No, you shouldn't have told me. What if they arrest you and you rat on me? Anyway, what's the risk? -You don't even know my name. Your name's Martin. Isn't that correct, Marcel? Where are we going? -You don't need to know. I'm taking you. Don't you trust me? -I don't even trust myself. I'd rather not know where I'm going. That's more relaxed. Damn. I can't find a doorbell. Are you coming? Who is it? -Martin. That's not L?tambot. -No, L?tambot got arrested. That's just great. We already worked together. Grandgil... Hello. If you know him... Are you sure of him? Absolutely. Besides, I didn't tell him much. He doesn't even know where we are. Good. Are you coming? Quick. It's late. Let's not waste any time. Did you do that? -So what? Well done. Good job. That pig had a good life. Are you an expert? -I love my meats. I prefer the shoulder. -We'll talk about that later. Don't you prefer the shoulder? -Yes, yes. Did Mrs. Mariette like the kidneys? They were not bad, but a little bit too fresh. I prefer the shoulder... With a bit of wine from the Alsace. Speaking of wine from the Alsace... Isn't this rum? -Listen, we're here to work. If he wanted to offer you some, he'd have done so. Yes, but he forgot. -Serve yourself. Don't waste our time. Is the street over there? -Of course. The Rue Poliveau. -The Rue Poliveau? What? It's a quiet little street. Do you want a drop? -I told you we don't have much time. You have to go to the Rue Lepic tonight. You told me Rue du Temple. There's not a lot of difference. -Two kilometres. Quiet. I do the talking. Listen, that's in Montmartre. How much does it pay? Alright, 50 francs extra, but be quick about it. I don't ask for much. 600 francs each or forget it. You want to take advantage of the situation. Advantage? Taking a pig from the Rue Poliveau to the Rue Lepic... Going through Paris with cops and Germans everywhere... And your shoes suffer after 6 kilometres in the dark... Eight. -I didn't ask you anything. Let's say 400 francs. At that price, get some bum to do it. I'll give you a break: 450 francs. 900 francs for the two of you. Tell me... This is number 45, isn't it? Why do you ask? -For no reason. I already know. Mr. Jambier. 45 Rue Poliveau. 5th district of Paris. -Quiet. We're talking seriously. 900 francs, alright. Mr. Jambier, 45 Rue Poliveau... ...for me, it'll be 1000 francs. Ignore him. Give me 900 francs and I'll arrange it with him. Alright, I lose 1000 francs. But you get lost with your trusted friend. He doesn't know what he's saying. He's a loser. I'm not sure. He scares me. Besides, he has golden teeth. So what? -What if he's a cop? A real one or a fake? -What does it matter? You did a good job. Mr. Jambier... 45 Rue Poliveau... Now it's 2000 francs. That's it. Give me a hand. Here! Here! Thank you. Don't mention it at all. Look, top quality. Vandal! These are not times to destroy merchandise. No! Don't! My money. My money. -I was going to say 3000. Give back that money. Do you hear me? Let it go. -Sure, take his side. I do what I want with my money. -Alright, alright. Mind your own business. And hurry up with those suitcases. Damn sack. My Christmas ham! Listen, you have your 3000 francs. Now go. Without the pig? I was promised a pig. Forget the pig. -I'm not going to carry it on my own. Out of the question. Jambier was joking. I'm not letting you down. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Tell me, Mr. Jambier... Now that we're friends... If they ask me about the pig... where did we get it from? Mr. Grandgil... I trust you're an honest man. We'll have to wait and see. Here's a packet of cigarettes for you. Only two missing. Now he's giving him cigarettes. What's wrong now? -Nothing. It's heavier than I thought. I want an extra 2000 francs. Are you serious? -You bet I'm serious. Not a cent! I want 2000 francs, Jambier! 2000 francs! -Nothing. Shall I beat him up? I want 2000 francs! Jambier, 45 Rue Poliveau. Yes, we know. Not a franc! Let me get him. Jambier! Jambier! Jambier! Jambier! Jambier! Enough! Are you crazy? They can hear you everywhere. It's nothing. Mr. Jambier, I'm warning you. And me? -And now leave. Leave. Leave. What about me? -Go. What about me? -What? We agreed on 450 francs. I already gave 5000. Case closed. I won't forget this pig. Let's get going. I didn't do too bad. 5000 francs without breaking a sweat. -Don't ask how. If you were on your own... But I took you there. When it comes to work, I'm honest. -What did you say? Totally honest. Don't look so angry. -How would you know? It's dark. I have eyes and ears. -What? Nothing. Do you want a cigarette, honest man? When I'm working, I have no time for pleasure. Besides, he gave the cigarettes to you. That's why I'm offering. -And that's why I don't want one. If that's what you want... Austerlitz Station... We'll take a left. The Jardin des Plantes... the markets... We'll go straight through the Marais. The Marais is not exactly my neighbourhood. Let's go. What's that? Wolves. Wolves in Paris? Are you kidding? We're close to the Jardin des Plantes. They smell the meat. Let's get the hell out of here. A good thing that people can't smell the meat. They can smell it alright. They just don't have the guts to go for it. It's a bench. You're lucky. Have a seat. Damn. Look at that. It's not even bleeding. -It's bleeding on the inside. I hate this work. -Why are you doing it then? You could do something else. -Any suggestions? Start for yourself. I'd need money. Would you give it to me? That money... is in the suitcases. How much does a kilo of pork pay on the black market? Starting that again? It's none of your business. 150 francs a kilo? -Maybe. 50 kilos each is 100 kilos total. That's 15,000 francs between the two of us. Don't you know any buyers here? I don't know any people like that. We'll have to find them then. Do you think you can sell meat the way you look? They'd think you stole it or that it was rotten. But you look better and you'd do the talking. You're starting to understand. If I had wanted to do that, I wouldn't have gotten you involved. The idea never crossed your mind. -The cops! Where do you live? -27 Rue de l'Ascension. Your ID! Come this way. Damn. -What's happening? The handle. Give me that. You take mine. Come, hurry. The door! The light. Are you coming in or not? Give us a break. What are we drinking? -I'm closing. Warm wine? -I'm closing. We want warm wine. The light! They're still there. Good boy. -Stop that. He's a bit fearful, but charming. I'd carry your suitcases to the ocean. On foot, on my knees, anyhow and anywhere. That's twenty francs. Don't worry, madam. It's honest money, earned honestly. A hundred... Five hundred... A thousand. Do you have a maid? -No. What about her? She's a neighbour. Jambier didn't pay me. You're joking. The bastard didn't pay you? Two warm wines. -I don't want to use gas all night. Give us four of them and we'll call it a day. What reason did he give for not paying you? He said: "The register's closed". He must have thought I'd share with you. I don't know what he thought but I do know I wouldn't accept it. I'm not offering. -But if you'd offer, I'd refuse. How would you know if you'd refuse, since I don't offer? Oh, stuff it. The light! The light! And? -Still there. That's 40 francs. There's no hurry. -Yes, we have to close. What about them? -They leave whenever they want. Can't we wait for some friends? I know your friends. They're waiting outside. These people would hand us over to the cops. So what? Mr. Paul, please help my husband put these suitcases outside. Stop that. That's not for poor people. Please leave without a scene. This is a quiet place. And honest. -Honest? Employing a Jew in a public place. She's not employed. She helps me. So you're exploiting her. I feel like turning you in. What's the use of laws if people don't observe them? Scum! -Never mind. Don't listen to him. People without a conscience revolt me. What a mess. I should put you all in prison. All in prison, no mercy! Crooks, anarchists, traitors. Your names and details. Come on. Alfred Couronne, born September 23 1883 in Aubenas, Ard?che. And Lucienne Couronne, born in Grenaille, 49 years of age, no children. In permanent employment until 1937. No criminal record. Military service... Enough! Too much already. Look at that loser with his alcoholic face and grey complexion. Nothing but sawdust in his head. Are you always going to look like that? And the old woman. Built on gelatine and bacon. Three chins and her tits hang on her belly. Fifty years each. A hundred years of stupidity. Such a vivid imagination. What are you doing on this planet? Aren't you ashamed you exist? Shut up! Shut up. Go. Come on. Do it, buddy. It's allowed. They're not saying anything. Come on. Look. Do you know where they're going? They're calling the cops. But I have something better for you. Six of you and two of us. Why are you hesitating with the suitcases? Smell it and tell me if it's good. You who only have sawdust sausage and tap water. There's food for three weeks in there. Come on. We won't be disappointed. What are you waiting for? Go on. Look. They're not even moving. And then they go and criticise the black market. Bunch of paupers. You're horrible. I don't want to know you. I wipe you out of my memory. You disgust me. Horrible! They're gone. You were dreaming. -I wish. I'd be in my bed. I agree about the owners, but why did you say they were ugly? And why did you yell at the others? "Bunch of paupers!"... Is it their fault that they're poor? And what did you want to achieve? That they beat us up or take the pig? And why not? Can't you get it through your head that it's not ours? You don't want to understand. The moon. Just what we needed. Damn! A dog! Cops. Damn dog. It will give us away. Leave it up to me. That's it. Was that German? -Yes. You speak German? -As you could hear. What did you say? A poem. I don't remember by whom. I can't help you there. So who saved the pig? -I have to admit it. Bravo. That pig's giving me inspiration. What would they have done with our pig? They would have kept it. -Really? What? -Jambier doesn't have a pig anymore. The cops took it. Goodbye, pig of Jambier. Hello, pig of Grandgil. I know what you're doing. Yes, but you don't know what I'm going to do for you. No, not at all. I'm giving you half my pig. The half you're carrying. Let's say I agree and we share the pig. Everybody would find out. And who'd give me work tomorrow? Nobody. You'll make others work. You'd become the boss. That's what happens when you're not honest. You disgust me. Do what you want, but I'm delivering the meat. I was only joking. -I don't feel like laughing. I like you. -You never know with you. Excuse me. Do you have a light? Young man. A light, please. It's not enough to be German. Be polite as well French? -Yes. Good. Do you have a light? We have no hands free. Bloody occupation! There's always two or three hanging around. Do you know the neighbourhood? - Yes, I live in the Rue de Turenne. Let's go via your place. -Why? Don't you want to know whether your pussycat came home? My what? -Your wife. A bit of respect, please. Her name's Mariette. Don't you want to know if Mariette came home? Why? -After what happened. What happened? -In the bar. What? -Between you two. First of all, she came home. Furthermore, I don't want to know. Besides, it's none of your business. You're unbelievable. Always sticking your nose into other people's lives. Forget I said anything. Just a moment then. Bloody dog! What a pain! Which number is it? Number 18. There's no key. She's back. -Yes, yes. How old is she? -That's none of your business. She's no spring chicken anymore. What would she do without you? Even when you try to be nice, you're an asshole. Is that you, Pierre? Did I wake you up? Tough luck. Listen carefully. That's Heine, isn't it? I don't remember. Thanks. Goodnight. Is she upstairs? Yes. -That was quick then. I didn't want to wake her up. Marcel! Mariette! Are you leaving? -What are you doing with that guy? I won't discuss that. Are you serious about this? -Why did you bring him along? I won't discuss that. I heard him on the phone. In German. Don't go. it's dangerous. -Why do you care, since you're leaving? But, no... If it's dangerous... I'm not leaving. I don't understand. -I won't leave you if you have problems. That's nice of you. -Really? Why did you bring him? So you wouldn't be able to meet up with him. That worked well, didn't it? What are you doing? Where are you? Here. I thought you walked out on me. Are you coming? I'm coming. Now there are two. Get lost. -Come. Damnit! -Here. What are you doing? -You'll see. What about this one? Damn. Another one. That's it. What's happening? Dogs! What are they doing here? Go away. Get lost. Go away. Go away. Outside. Go away. Go away. Out! Out! You too. You too. So much for your little idea. I'll kill one, so the others can eat it. Get lost. He's capable of it. Get lost. Hey you! Stop. There he is. Let me do the talking. What do you want? Police! -All I can see is the torch. Shut up. What's in those suitcases? Sir... We were looking for someone who could show us the way to the Rue des Archives. The Rue des Archives? It's behind you. Do you hear that? It's behind us. I told you. You got it wrong. We're lucky to have met you. We'll show you how to get to the Rue des Archives. First, follow me to the station. Why's that, sir? We're late already. We'd get into trouble. What's in those suitcases? I don't want to lie to you. This morning, I went to my property in Verri?res. I was only trying to please my wife. Are you married, by any chance? -Yes, but I have no children. You're quite right. I've got five. Anyway, I went to Verri?res. My servant was waiting. Is that him? -Yes. He's stupid, but he works hard. It shows. Does he have ID? Yes. -I've got lots of ID. Oh my! What? What? Not so fast. The cop will need some time to wake up. When he comes to, all the police in the neighbourhood will be after us. I doubt that. I've got his whistle in my pocket. You wouldn't have thought of that, would you? Maybe, but I'm not in the habit of taking out police men. I would have talked our way out of it easily. Thanks to you, I'm wanted in my own neighbourhood. You don't care. You're not from here. Where are you from? What do you want from me? But you're not sure. That's enough. I know how to get rid of them. Wait. -The pork No! No! Don't! You're an asshole. Mariette warned me you're an asshole. Don't do that. Come here. I'll give you food. I'll set you straight. Careful. A patrol. Don't make any problems. Your hat. What? -Your hat. Quick. A patrol. -That was close. Between French... Stop! Are they looking for you? -Possibly. Parachutists? Excuse me. That was lucky. I can hide you. The people who live here can be trusted. Let's go to the basement. We have to make a delivery tonight. -I admire you and I envy you. Listen, They're coming tonight. -Damn! That's all we needed. Don't say that, Martin. The lady's disappointed. What is it? Black market? Yes, miss. It's pork. I'm interested too. -You are? No! It's not ours. One pork chop? -No. Let's run. I'm scared. Let's go into the subway. Such bad luck. Ten more minutes... Don't stay outside. Seek shelter. We're here. -I wonder where that is. My house. -You live here now? I always did. Hurry, Max. You can put it there. On the tiles. Come in. Do you have a painter as room mate? I am a painter. I told you. I thought you meant house painter... ...like this. No. Painter... ...like that. You're an artist. Yes. -Did you paint all this? Don't you recognize it? It's the bar where we met. I worked on it for a week. It's not bad. You're not exactly poor. I never said I was. By the way... ...give the 5000 francs back to that coward Jambier. He'll be happy. But how do you make money? By selling my paintings. Do you want a coffee? It'll do you good. You sell your paintings? Yes, and I'm starting to do well. -So you didn't join me for the money? Well, no. But why then? Out of curiosity. That's why I followed you. I admit I was a bit disappointed. I had a different expectation of the black market. What did you think it was like? More black. Jambier's an idiot. He's a push-over. And what about me? Jambier's using you. That's my business. You stay out of it, artist. You don't depend on it for a living. Tell me if this smells good. Tomorrow, you'll have forgotten about Jambier, but I... What? -I work, if you know what work is. You ruined my work. Yes! You were having fun, without worrying about the consequences. And then you assault a cop in my neighbourhood. And all without any risk. -I didn't take a risk? When you have a lot of money you risk nothing. That's what you think. I risk losing it all. Well, why then? -Why what? Why did you do it? -Why? To see how far you can go during an occupation. Did you see how far? Did you see how much we got away with? Also with the rich, like Jambier, who are afraid that we expose them to the poor. And the poor are afraid too. You have to wonder why. Being afraid must be in fashion. And you're never afraid? -No, not so far. I hope something unexpected is going to fall on your head. Something you didn't want. You wish that? I'd have a good laugh. The air-raid alarm? That's no reason. They should have been at your place before the alarm. Don't worry. They must be going slowly. Slowly? He didn't come across very slow. Who? The fellow he left with. Which fellow? What? No! And you let them leave with... ...the merchandise? No! The light! Ang?le! Jambier, I'm in this for 50%. If they don't show up, you'll pay for it. And you know how much. You're in it for 50% of the profit but also of the risk. Quiet. You shouldn't have trusted just anybody. I took who I could get. What if he gives me away? He's capable of doing that. If I go down, you go down. Don't worry. He'll give both of us away. Ang?le! The veal. Nothing. I'm talking to my wife. -What? The veal. Come down. That Martin! Never again! What's going on? The veal. -What? We have to get rid of it. Why? Another stupidity by Jambier. I'll explain later. We'll put it in the basement. -In the basement? Where? Under the charcoal. Get rags, the saw and the cleaver. We'll have to cut it up tonight. I'll get them for this. Here's the saw. -Dig a hole. Don't get pissed off. Have a coffee and then we'll go. I don't have time. -Your butcher's really close. That's not the point. I don't want your coffee. Wait for me then. -I'll go alone. You can't carry 100 kilos. -I'll do it in two steps. I want to get my 450 francs. -Don't joke about money. I'll give you your 450 francs. -No, I don't want that, buddy. I'm not your buddy, bastard. Of course... you're very strong. Don't worry. I can't get angry with you. It's just that... -No. After what you've done, I don't want to see you anymore. Go ahead of me. That way you won't see me. You don't even know where it is? -Shut up. I don't want your advice. It's here. Marchandot. Marchandot. Marchandot. Marchandot. What if he's not here? -Why wouldn't he be here? We could return the suitcases to Jambier. Shut up. I'd rather die. I won't spend my life carrying pork with you. Marchandot. Marchandot. Shut up. Marchandot. Marchandot. Marchandot. Marchandot. I'm fed up. Fed up. Get lost. Marchandot. Marchandot. Wake up. Come out, Marchandot. Marchandot. Marchandot. Get up. Wake up. Marchandot. Marchandot. Get up. Marchandot! Marchandot! Marchandot! Marchandot! Marchandot! Marchandot! Come on, Marchandot. Careful. He's escaping. He's escaping. -Get him. Shoot! Shoot! The suitcases. You too. Get in. Get in. Get in. Strange mix of people for a Louis XV hotel. A very nice hotel. Except, the uniforms don't go well with the furniture, don't you think? I don't care. A police station during a military occupation. Worth seeing. Not to me. What's the risk? -For you, nothing, maybe. But I'll be forced to join the Service of Obligatory Work. Because I'm unemployed. You're too old. There's no age for unemployment. Unemployed? Me too. With shoes like that? I'd be surprised. And Mariette? Without me... ...and without money... Without me, without money... it's the same thing. Damned occupation. Mr. Grandgil? Yes, sir. -The painter? Yes, sir. A rather strange place to meet. But in times of war... Please, come with me. If you don't mind... This gentleman's with me. Please. You're quite famous in our country as well. A cousin of mine in Cologne owns one of your works. That's nice. A lithography. Of a girl, I believe. I see that you're also interested in dead creatures. A beautiful pig, isn't it? Do you know the expression... "In every Frenchman, slumbers a pig." And maybe in every man. Maybe. And at the moment, the pig slumbers in the countryside. I had to kill my pig in its sleep. I did it this morning on my property in Barbizon. Barbizon! Of course, a painter... Do all painters still live in Barbizon? Some of them. Mr. Grandgil, I would like to ask you... That's a large quantity of pork. I've got many friends. Maybe it has too. What's the name of this gentleman? Martin. Do you have Mr. Martin's papers? Major. He likes you. -Let me do the talking. Talk to him in German. -He likes to speak French. Ah, yes? Maybe... It says here that you're a cab driver. And what's your job now? Let's see... Well... The thing is... There aren't many cabs at the moment, I think. No, there aren't many cabs, but... What I'm trying to say is... -Are you unemployed maybe? My friend Martin unemployed? He's never worked harder. He does everything. He's not just my assistant... He's my agent, my bookkeeper, my secretary. Don't be modest now. -I do what I can. And on top of that, he's my model. You love the arts, sir. Look at that beautiful face. And so French. Don't you agree? If anybody in France is not unemployed... ...it's Martin. The Commander wants to talk to the Major. Right away. Yes. Very good. Thank you, Mr. Grandgil. Major, a phone call for you. It's the Commander. Good, I'll be right there. Will you excuse me? What do you say to your friend Grandgil? Indeed, thank you. -After all... Do you think we'll get the pork back? That's asking a lot. They like it too. Of course, yes. And you've already done a lot. Especially for me. I like you, Martin. But you don't like me. Is the Major in? -Yes. Good. What's going on? -There has been an assault. An officer was killed by terrorists. I was expecting you. Make a list of all the French prisoners. Yes, major. Come with me. -Yes, sir. Did he say Rue Cherche-Midi? Shut up, I don't know. They killed a Colonel. Go out, come on. Hurry. I'm only asking where we're going. I want to know where we're going. Not the woman. Not the woman. -Why not? Not the woman. Come on, go. -Come on. They killed a Colonel. -That's not our fault. They're getting us by doing that. -What are they going to do to us? For one dead German... I heard them say "Cherche-Midi". Where are they taking us? Madam. Please inform Mrs. Mariette. 22 Rue de Turenne. Will you remember? Yes. Mariette, 22 Rue de Turenne. Tell her... What do I tell her? I don't know. This is all bullshit. What is? -You, me, them and their war. I want to know where we're going. Let go of me. Stop that. Let go of me. Let go of me. No. No. I don't want to go. I don't want to go. Murderers. Murderers. I don't want to go. What will happen to us? -I don't know. You do know. -No, I don't. Grandgil. That's me. -Come out. What is it? What about me? Martin! What about me? What about me? What about me? Stop! We're here. Do you want a porter? Yes. -Porter! Thank you. The train to Cannes. Carriage 5. Hurry up. Martin! Shit! Excuse me... Are you... Grandgil. Yes. I remember! Well, well... Grandgil... Still carrying suitcases, Martin? Yes! Other people's! Goodbye! Goodbye!
