Captioning made possible by lions gate films Let's go. Yeah, yeah. What do you say, len? Can we just get out of here and go home? Let's go home. How you doing, Lenny? Bobby. Bobby: See, here's the deal. Hand over the judges to me right now. I'll see what I can do about saving your life. Who's gonna save your ass, bro? Motherfucker! Hmm... American... Mmm. Hi there. My--shit! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just-- I'm sorry. Who are you? How did you get in here? How did you get in? The front door-- I came in. I came through the door. Are you a cop? Do I look like a cop? Answer the question. M-Max gave me a key. I'm his brother--Jack. What? It's nice to meet you. Uh... Ok, I'm sorry. I completely apologize, all right? All right? Jeez. Ooh. You guys have got a great place. It is. This place, it's great, really nice... Like this stuff here. Which one of you is the collector? Because this stuff looks like it could be in a museum. Ok, I'm cooperating. Max doesn't have a brother, asshole. We're not that close, that's all. Shut up. Uh! You know, I really wish you wouldn't do that. Shut the fuck up. Ooh. Where is your gun? I don't have a gun. But you have very soft hands. Uh! Ok, look, now you're starting to piss me off, all right? I don't want to hurt you. I didn't come here to Rob from you, steal any of your shit what did you have in mind? Nothing. I'm Max's brother. Ok, now I'm pissed off! Max's brother wouldn't be carrying a little thing like that. I don't have a complex about the size of my knife. Maybe you should. Max has a knife. He has a very big knife. I remember the size of my brother's knife. You're Jaime, huh? He met you in New Orleans, the summer he was doing long hauls. It was 5 years ago, wasn't it? 5 years ago. He said you were crazy. You know what? He was right? Max said that? Yeah, he did. When did you see him last? A long time ago. The last time I saw him was the day he left home. And that--i was 16. That was 9 years ago, a long time. And when did he give you the key? He mailed it to me. Ah. I understand he's been working the collection business the past couple years. Yeah. So? I might have a job for him. What is it? A job. Quick, easy. Make some real cash. What's real cash? I'll wait until my brother gets home. That's a good idea. We're gonna get along just fine, Jaime. I have a good feeling about this. Me, too, Jack. I have goose pimples. Ladies and gentlemen, the next item we have up for bid is lot number 54, an original 17th-century German presentation broadsword with highly polished straight double-edged 34-inch blade. I will open the bidding at 5,000. Do I hear $5,000? Let me hear 5. I want to hear 5. I want to hear 5. Let's have 5. I have 5. Now I want to hear 6... Max, that's your stuff. You need that right in your house. Why, I'd take that woman. Lord have mercy. Stud in the belly and all. Goddamn. Ha ha. Woo! Max, you know what I bought here last week, man? A moose's head, a fucking moose's head. Weighed damn near 300 pounds. Ha ha! But you know something? My wife loves it. Because they stole it from coppola's house, and coppola is her all-time favorite director. Ha ha! Shit. Love, right? That's what it is. 95 going once, twice, 3 times. To the gentleman right here, number 77--front table. Thank you. Well, 20,000 bucks and a moose's head, and she loves my ass forever. But I haven't seen you buy nothing yet today. You ain't going cheap on us or something? You used to be the fiercest one in this whole place, always down there in the front row. Now your ass is hanging back here with all these damn cheapskates. Now, I can't remember the last time I seen your hand raised. Max, you ain't going cheap on us, man? Work with me, Max. Max...you're not broke, are you, Max? Oh, goddamn. Ha ha! Oh, shit. You broke! Hey, you need a job. Hey, Mr. Tutu, come over here. Give him a size, what? Large. And the hat to go with it. That's a damn shame, Max-- a grown man ain't got a pot to piss in or one to throw it out of. Jack: I'm gonna have this thing fixed up in a jiff. Here. Thank you. He's going to kill me. I'm telling you, he's going to be very happy to see me. I haven't seen him in a long time. I'm talking about the chair. Why? This thing is not worth anything. Don't tell me. You work at sotheby's? No, I don't. But I do know fine things when I see them. You want a drink? Yes. Please. You know, I'll have whatever you're having. Good choice. Thank you. So, what do you do? I mean, do you work with Max? Yup, yup. Max and I work together. So what? You're so defensive. So what? There you go. Look at that, huh? Good as new. I am good. So this, is this your collection? That? No. That's Max's stuff. I collect other kind of shit. What other kind of shit do you collect? You know, the usual. Yeah? Barbie dolls, you know, baseball cards. Mm-hmm. Ingestible poisons. That's cute. Oh. Come on. Here. Better? That's much better. Cheers. Thank you. Ahh. Good. You don't trust me, Jack. I don't know you, Jaime. Oh, let me see it. Oops. How does it feel? Are your hands getting numb? Ok, are you feeling numb? Here, here. How many fingers am i-- how many fingers am I holding? That's all right. Don't worry. I'll just watch you. It's ok. It's ok. Relax. Enjoy. Be careful with that because you're going... Well, always next time, huh, maxie boy? Always next time. Wait. I tell you what. Hold on. If you help me load this stuff in this trunk, maybe I'll give you one of these candlesticks, huh, help light your way back home, plus $2.00 or $3.00. Because, you know, ain't no romance in a goddamned pot, man. Ha ha! Motherfucker's broke. Hey! I'm sorry, Jack. Maybe you are Max's brother. Maybe you aren't. But I can't afford to fuck around, you know. What did you do to me? Ornithogalum umbellatum-- star of Bethlehem. It's just 50 milligrams, so it shouldn't last too long. Don't do that. I feel like shit. Don't move too much, please. I would rather you didn't do that. You know, I learned this while I was doing juvie time at tryon... And I can never get enough practice, so... How do I look? You know, nothing like Max, but not too bad. Man: Max, are you in there? Don't wander off. Max! Max! Max! Max! Shut up. What? Hi, piece. Is Max not back yet? No, he's not back yet. Come on. What? You not gonna do, "piece, come in"? Piece, come in. What was that? Hi, baby. God, I hate this place. What? What is it? It gives me the creeps. It's just--i worry about you, and it's so-- it's all this shit. I'm helpless. I'm a woman. What did you want me to do? What is it? What did you come back for? Wellings--he rooked us. You mean, you screwed up. No, I didn't screw up. I went and I did a pickup for Max at wellings'. But he rooked us-- 2 grand short, 2 grand! Max sent you on a job by yourself? Yes. What? I-- I'm doing things by myself all the time. What is this? I got responsibilities. Remember last week? You remember when I went for the movie guy's face? Remember that? Whose idea was that? That was my idea, taking the face instead of the body, because, you know, he's a movie guy. That was me--face-- all me--face. And because of that, Max gives you wellings? I mean, how--what did the fucker buy anyway? He bought v.C.R.S, tvs. The same thing he always buys-- v.C.R.S and tvs could I have a--ahem-- could I have a bucket, please? Who are you? No! No! Piece! Who are you? Who are you?! He's Max's brother. I'm Max's brother. Piece, hold it. He's Max's brother. I'm Max's brother. Max's brother. Why you got Max's brother tied to a chair for? Because he probably isn't Max's brother. Whatever! What is it that you need, piece? What is it? Wellings, wellings. What are we gonna do? He rooked us. We? This is your screwup, piece. Why didn't you count the money when he gave it to you? I didn't think I had to, all right? I mean, we've been working with this guy 5, 6--i don't know how many months. I trusted him. Piece, you're a crook. What are you doing trusting anybody? You--that's it. That is it. That's-- I got in the mess because I trusted you. You know, that envelope was right on the table in front of us the whole time we were sitting there. Why--i mean, you could have counted that. You could have counted-- why didn't you count the money? I mean-- I couldn't do it. It would have been impolite, you know. Now I look like an idiot in front of Max's friend. Jaime: Brother. Whatever! God. The point is that-- I don't know what the point is. You stupid--you're stupid. You're a stupid bitch. Where are you going? To get my money. Yo, did I tell you to come with me? You stay here. You ain't coming with me. Jaime: You call him a cheat, and he'll shoot you dead. Piece: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come here, baby. Come here, hmm? Oh, that's Jack, honey, or, at least, that's what we're calling him for now. Who are you? You mean, right now? She's from another planet, Jack. Do you want to talk to her? Do you want to hear stories about meteors and comets and little green men? Of course, it doesn't make her any more full of shit than you are. Baby, why don't you go and get Angie? I'll go get Angie now. I'm from Mars. Martians know all your secrets. Psst. Get in there. What is that all about? Ask piece. She's his. He picked her up awhile ago when we were living in New Orleans. She was trying to sell magnolia blossoms to the people. Fly! What are you doing? What did I tell you? Sorry. That's ok. Anyway, you know, she was trying to sell these flowers and she had the idea all wrong, so she was actually paying people to take the things from her. When we're getting ready to leave town, piece decides to bring her along. I don't know. I guess it makes him feel important, you know, to have a human pet. I hope it makes him feel good about himself. It ain't doing shit for her. She was better off on the street. You know, being owned is better than starving to death. Bullshit. It's a pity you don't look anything alike. I always hoped Max had an identical twin, somebody with his face and someone else's head. â™ª Hands are small â™ª and she only has one head â™ª â™ª and some hair Jaime, Max is crazy. I don't know what he's going to do if he comes home and finds his only brother tied to a chair. Hmm? The shit I get talked into. Jaime! If I don't get a cashew nut, I'm gonna puke! Jaime! Jaime! Jaime, we're moving on. You close up your deals. Don't take on any more. We are no longer residents of this stinkhole city. I have not had a pleasant stay in the city of Los Angeles. I have not had a profitable stay in the city of Los Angeles. But that's ok. That's ok, because I've learned something. And when I'm learning something, nobody can say that I'm moving assways. You know what I learned? I learned you can't get back respect once you've lost it. Do you remember when we first came to this city? People would see me and they would say, "that man has had some success. "That man has success written all over him. That is a successful man." And they all treated me accordingly-- you know, nice comments about my shoes, my clothes, valet parking--yay. And now, a couple of bad-- a few weeks, a couple of lousy bad months, and what do I get?! I get 10 tuxedoless freaks with serving trays and not one goddamned nut in the whole place! Here, baby. Oh. Shh. No... No...no. Don't you give me any lip about moving again either. We're gonna have a fresh start... Maybe Chicago or Detroit, somewhere new, somewhere that I can be treated like a... Like a successful man. You want to be a successful man, Max? Where did you come from? I've been sitting right here the whole time. New boyfriend, sister Mary Agnes? He says he's your brother--Jack. My brother. Nice to see you again, bro... Particularly since we've never seen each other before, particularly since I don't have a brother, and since I never have had a brother. I could be considered brotherless. I find it very interesting. Why don't you explain it to me? Apparently, I'm not his brother, after all. I should have just shot you. Why don't you? Was it Jack? Jack. Is it Jack? Jack, if that's your real name... It's as good as any. So, what do we do now, Jack? What do you want to do? I was sent here by a friend of yours-- Bernie Nick. Bernie Nick! Yeah, I know Bernie. So, how do I know you know him? He's the one that told me the story about New Orleans and the long hauls. Right? I had it right, Jaime. Didn't I have it right? Max: So what? Bernie is a dick. I don't trust him. I know. And neither do I. If I had to, I would have used him, but instead, I want to use you. Use us for what? I have a proposition, a little business proposition, a collection tonight. It's a big take, very minimum risk. How big? How minimum? It's $1 million in cash. What do you think? And how much of the money comes our way? I was thinking about 5%. How about 10%-- $100,000 each, $100,000 a head. Oh, yeah. Yeah what? We don't even know what we're doing. You want the long version or the short version? Give me the short version. I need protection. Give me the long version. All right, all right, all right! The long version. 8 months ago in San Francisco, my friends and I were hired to obtain some merchandise-- a set of very rare antiques from the court of king Charles iv of Spain. They were known as the Spanish judges. The guy was willing to pay very well for them. No questions, all of that. He showed us the house the merchandise was in. We spent nearly 2 weeks getting our plan together. But when we finally moved in, another group of hired thieves had beaten us to the punch. The Spanish judges were gone. They disappeared earlier that night. Like I said, the pieces were in demand. My associate and I went back to our employer with the bad news. He was furious. He took it out on my best friend's skull. They beat him within an inch of his life. And once it was over, he hired us right back again. He just couldn't let go of the idea of having the judges all to himself. You follow? Max: Sure. Sure, sure. He sent you and your crooks to rub out the other crooks for a better price. 6 months and 5 cities until we finally found them. They had been holed up in this little motel right outside of Tucson. We confronted them. We didn't really know what we were doing. And then one of them just started shooting, and all hell broke loose. I watched all my companions get gunned down one by one, including my best friend. Excuse me. But when I searched the car, it almost seemed worth it... Because there in all their glory were the Spanish judges. Well, it's a crying shame. I mean, you got this bright and shiny merchandise and nobody to share it with. Max, what i'm telling you is I need your help here. See, and you can make a really smart choice and make a lot of money really quickly and really easily, or you can just let go of the damn rope and drop me off the edge. But you know what? I really wish you'd make up your mind, ok? Because I'm wet and I'm cold, and to tell you the truth... I'm not too fond of the view. Jaime, I don't know what you're thinking. I don't know what the fuck you think you're thinking. What? Huh? Blah, blah, blah. Stop whining. We're taking the offer. Why? Because you said so? Yeah. You make the decisions? No, no, no. I make the decisions. You need the money, Max. Shut the fuck up! Yes. We need the money. "We need the money." "We need the money." Well, you're sounding like a wife. We can't say no, and you know it. We can't say no. This is not what we do. We are not bodyguards. We are crooks. We don't even know if he has a decent plan yet. Jack, what's your plan? We're set to meet tonight at midnight at a warehouse over on Hartford. I got the merchandise. I've got a rented Van. All I need is backup in case they try something stupid. All I need you to do is watch my sorry ass, Max. His sorry ass. We can do that. We can watch his sorry ass. We can definitely do that. Between you and piece and me, we can definitely--ooh. What? Piece. What? Wellings may have shot him, like, 2 hours ago. Oh. When were you going to tell me that? It just didn't come up. Is he dead or alive? You know wellings. I mean-- don't even try--don't even think about doing this without piece. No, right? No. I'm not going to go deal with wellings. I'm not. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No. You're sorry what? I've done my research on both of you. You're both very capable people, right, but in all due respect, when it comes to guns, neither one of you can hit the broadside of a barn. It was very nice meeting both of you, but I'm gonna take my business elsewhere. Thank you. Sit the fuck down. Sit the fuck down! You know what? I'm going to sit down. We'll be right back. I'm sitting. What do you want to do? You want to go to wellings'. Are you crazy? No.we're going to go to wellings', smart ass. Why? Why? Because we need the fucking money, that's why. Ok, ok, ok, ok. What are we going to do about him? I don't want to him to go around to hire someone else. I'm not gonna let some stranger roam around in my stuff. I'm not coming with you, risk getting my ass shot. Jack: Aw. Come on. Man: Come on in here. Don't be shy. It's nice to see the both of you. Max: Good evening, wellings. How you doing tonight? I see you're cooking up a little dinner for yourself there. A friend of mine mixed this up for me. I don't know what it is. I don't know what it does. But I can't wait to find out. You should let me mix up something for you sometime. Oh, no. I know everything about you, spider lady. Not quite everything. Piece: Hey. How you doing, piece? Fine. And you? Good, thanks. Piece, you can do things on your own, can't you? You can handle things by yourself. Max: You guys finished? Hmm? Done? Yeah. Well, I'm glad to see you didn't rush to judgment on our little friend there. What did he say to you? He called me a cheat... Piece: That's right. Said I rooked him. Well, you did rook him. So I made a mistake. Ok... I ain't got to hear about it from the likes of you. People like you deserve whatever they get. Ok, let's talk through this, wellings. Let's talk about money. Saw you looking. Look at that-- it's 9:00. It's 9:00 on the nose. Come on. Well, didn't Max tell you to untie me at 9:00? Isn't that what he said, "9:00, untie him"? No. No? But he didn't say you couldn't untie me at 9:00, did he? Yes, he did. Max: So, what are you gonna-- what are you gonna charge us for our friend hanging from the ceiling there? 5 grand. 5 grand. That's fine. That's good. 5 grand. I'll tell you what, Jaime and I tomorrow will bring you $3,000 worth of merchandise, ok? $3,000 of equipment, whatever you need. That plus the mistaken 2 comes to 5. And we're even. Fine. Then rude boy... Piece: Twit! Can just stay here and spend the night with me. We'll have some fun. Why, you motherfucking lucky son of a bitch... Shut the fuck up! I'm gonna kick your ass in half! I know. It's funny. I have $3,000 here. I do. Here's 3,000, you see? This is a marker for you. I'm gonna give it to Jaime. And Jaime, she's gonna put it in an envelope and seal it, give it back to you... You see? You hold onto that tonight as a marker, and tomorrow, I'm gonna bring the $3,000 worth of merchandise and give it to you and, of course, you'll give me back the envelope. But he goes now. Correct. Ok, so, I assume there's a key. Right, ok. Piece, is this yours? Yeah. Bring me some tuners... I need some good tuners. I've heard a lot about you. About me? Oh, yeah, sure. Everybody's heard about the girl from Mars. It's in all the newspapers, and I can tell you my friends are gonna be very jealous when I tell them that I met you. Oh, how jealous they'll be. Really? Sure. Every man in America wants to meet a girl from Mars... Especially one with beautiful, beautiful eyes like you have. No, no. I don't want an American man. I want a man from Mars. All right. Hey, look, what's your name? Come on, really. What's your name? I can't say. I'm not gonna tell Max or Jaime or anything. Look, cross my heart and hope to die. No. Ok, I'll tell you what, how about I call you-- I'll call you, uh, Mars girl. You like that, don't you? I'll tell you what, Mars girl, you want to meet Mars boys? You got to go way back to Mars. And to get back to Mars, you're gonna need a lot of money, so why don't you come over here right now and reach into my pocket? Come here, Mars girl, reach in my pocket. What are you laughing at? Come here and reach into my pocket. No! No? I don't need money to get to Mars. Someone will come for me. They will, huh? Uh-huh. Someday, a beautiful stranger will come and take me back to where I really belong, and then I'll be truly happy. But maybe i'm the beautiful stranger. No. Men where I come from... Don't have scars. Piece: It was a goddamn good fight in there. Jaime: Very slick talking in there, brother pio. Very slick hands, sister Mary Agnes. Thank you. Merci. I knew it was coming, and I didn't even see it. What did you put in there? Coupons from radio shack, you know. Here. Where did you find $3,000 in cash? Jack's wallet. Who carries that kind of money around with them anyway, huh? Successful people, baby. Jaime, what we do back there we did well. We should stick with what we do well. What we did back there is not going to make us $100,000 each, baby. One-zero-zero- zero-zero-zero. I don't think-- what? I got a bad feeling about this guy. Something's gonna go wrong. Yeah, it's gonna be too easy, ok? Come on, piece, let's go. I'm gonna go to piece's apartment. He's gonna pick out for me, like, a nice gown for tonight. You go home. Get the mannequins ready. We'll be there in, you know... What for? A few minutes. Come on... What for? Get out. Get out. Come on. Something. Get in the car. Ah, just get going. Why?! Why?! Because you say so, huh? Because you say so? Fine, fine. I've got a hole in my wrist. You're lucky it's not around your neck. Help me out here. What are you doing? Another one of Jaime's stupid ideas-- dress the mannequins up, put them in the car, park it in front of the warehouse, and when these people see it-- then they think that you've got an army of backup. It's a genius idea. I know. Maybe I'm talking to the wrong person. I mean, I just naturally figured that you were in charge, but... Oh, I'm sorry. I am on your team. I just don't know why everyone else doesn't feel that way around here. Are you talking about Jaime? Well, the whole thing. Yeah. Well, she used to. You know, what bothers me about you people, Max? I haven't seen a single gun since I've been here, unless you're talking about...These. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Look... First of all, don't go snooping around and touching my things. Secondly, they're not guns. They're antiques... French flintlocks. It's my newest addition. Oh... That is nice. Old dueling pistols. They come in a boxed set. Yeah? Yeah? I don't have all the literature on them yet. I've only had them a month or so. But eventually-- where are they from? See the tag? It says "laroche." That's French-- laroche. What's it mean-- laroche? It doesn't mean anything. It's a town in France. Mm-hmm. Quite grim, aren't they? Yeah. Guns make me nervous. Never carried one. Us either. If you need a gun, you're doing something wrong. That's why piece has so many. He does everything wrong. Collecting is about Patience, Jack... Unless you've got a lot of money-- you can put all your collection together at once. See this burgonet here? 15th century. It's part of a complete set of armor made by the missaglia family of Milano. I only have the helmet right now, but I know a guy who has the pauldrons. When I get it all together... You know, bit by bit, that's ok. I have what I have, and what I have makes me happy. I have what I have, and what I have makes me happy. It's beautiful. It really is. I know. But so is a new caddy, so is new furniture. So, why do you have a cabinet full of antiques? Why does your guy want the Spanish judges, hmm? For the beauty? For an investment? No. Antiques are not about money, Jack. They're not even about the beauty. They're about ownership. They're about position. They're about... Success. They're about saying, "I have the power to reach back into the past and grab anything I want, make it mine." An antique can say that. A new caddy can never say that. Oh, I understand that completely. You think a lot about that, though, about being a successful man, about being treated the way you deserve to be treated. Yeah, I'll get there. You'll see. Detroit. Detroit. Detroit. Or maybe... Maybe Chicago after that. Here's to Texas the year after that, huh? We have chosen a very tough business, Max. It's hard enough to go at it alone, and then you've got all these dependents. It's just-- that's my problem. If I was an independent operator again, you know, I'd get it like that. Like that. Jaime. Jaime. What does she know about being successful? Do you know what she has in the closet back there? You're talking about the poisons, right? Unbelievable. Unbelievable. With a job like ours, a hobby like that. And don't think it makes for comfortable living arrangements. Every time we get in a fight, I have to stay up all night and listen for the closet door to open. That ain't right. It's selfish is what it is. The bitch. What? Nothing. Yeah. You said something. What did you say? Nothing. My life is such a mess. Hello, gentlemen. Hey. Is he getting funny with the mannequins again? Are you? I'm gonna be up on the roof. At 11:15, come get me. All right. You know... Yeah, this better be on the level, right? I mean, like, it better be, like, like everything you say. Don't worry about it, piece. Ha. Girl, girl. Uh-oh. Looking for you, huh? I missed you. Piece, why don't you go and get some sleep? We've got to get going in a couple of hours. I want to go over the plan again. It's all right. We'll have plenty of time when you get back. Come on. Wha... Come on. All right. Let's go. Bye. Plane for Tahiti. Vroom! That looks good on you... The gun. You know how to use it? I've used it a couple of times. But Max just won't allow it in the house. Why? Because, uh, when we fight, we fight. Oh, yeah? Did he hit you? No. You did it. You did that. Oh. It doesn't hurt, though. It doesn't hurt? No. Is this a challenge? Where you going? Hey, you know, you seem to be in a much better mood than when I first met you. You brought some excitement into my life, Jack. Glad to hear it. Um... Jamie, why'd Max go up on the roof? Uh, he goes there to think, you know? Max likes to have everything thought out in advance. That's why tonight makes him so nervous. Yeah? What, um... What makes you nervous? Max. He's a very bad boy, Jack, a very bad boy... A very jealous boy. You wouldn't want him, you know, jumping to conclusions here. Well, Max is on the roof. What Max doesn't know won't hurt him. All right. Well, what else makes you nervous? Not much. I like surprises. That's why Max and I are so unhealthy together-- because he's a control freak, and I'm just not that kind of girl. I can see that. Why do you stay? You can find better. I'm looking for something else. I can see that. But you just don't walk away from a man like Max. He's very determined. Of course, I'm at your service. Do you really know what you're getting into? Oh, yeah. No, not really. I don't. Unh! Jesus Christ. I know what you want. Oh, you do? Oh, no. Not again. Uh-huh. Ok. You're going to learn to love it. Hey. Jack, uh, wanted to wash up. How about napping with me for a few minutes? It's time to go. All right. Go on upstairs. Wait for us. We'll be back soon. No, you cannot come with us. Cannot. She'll be quiet. She will. She'll be quiet. You know, you drive really fucking slow for a bad guy. Are you sure you want to get out of the Van by yourself? No, but that's what I told them I'd do. I don't want to do something stupid and scare them into something... Really stupid. Watch me in the rearview mirror, and if you see something-- I know. I signal piece, he starts shooting. I know. Right. Hey, piece... Try to miss me, all right? Don't worry, Jack. I never miss. Oh, that's great. That's really great. Cha-chig! Hee hee hee! Shh. A gun. Uh, can I borrow a gun for this? I told you, I don't carry guns. That's great. That's great protection i'm getting for my money. How are you doing, buckaroo? If everything's ok, you signal, correct? Then you come out with the boxes. Right. Ok. Hold this. Oh, shit! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You bastard! Aah! All right, all right. Gun! He's got a gun! Aarrgghh! Unh! What? He's got a gun! It's all right, girl girl. You get on over in the corner. Go! Come on! All right. It's all right. I got him. I got him. Piece: Go into the corner. Piece! Max: Piece! Go, go, go, go, go! Goddamn you, backwards! Get the fucking money, now! That's it, that's it, that's it. Max: Well, go get it! I'm going, going! Go! Jamie: What the hell are you guys doing?! I've almost got it! Down, down, down, down! Jack! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Piece! Piece! You ok? You ok? Huh? Ok. Pow! Pow! It's ok. It's ok. She's ok. Pow! She's all right. She thought it was funny. That's great. Will you take this thing off? Take it off. People can see you. If we get pulled over, it's your fucking fault. Ah! I can't get it. It's got, uh, those-- those code things. Ok. Let's go. What are you doing? Uh, hairs in the carpet and stuff. Ok. Gloves? Everybody had their gloves on, yes? Nobody touched anything without their gloves? Is that correct? Right. Shit. I didn't even think about it. You...are a problem. What are we going to do about this? Torch the Van. Torch the Van. Right? No. We're not going to torch the Van. You and I are going to come back here tomorrow morning. We'll get rid of this. Nobody will find it before then. Good. Can we go now? Come on. You ready? Don't worry, Jack. I'll protect you. Protect me from what? Is anything else going to go wrong? Yeah. Here. You can tell me now. What happened in there? Look, what you saw is what went on. What? I didn't see anything. I didn't see a damn thing. Jack said somebody pulled a gun on him. He said hit him, so I hit him. Max, is that true? Jack: I can't get the case open! I can open it with my X-ray vision. Jamie: It doesn't make any sense. Why didn't they wait for Jack to get away from the Van first? Just shut the fuck up for a while. You make so much noise. What about you, Max? You were supposed to be the lookout. The lookout! You were supposed to be watching! Why did Jack have to see the fucking gun? You were supposed to be watching. You're really starting to piss me off. Ok. You know what we need? We need, like, a rock, ok? Or an electric drill. Does anyone have a drill? Something, anything. Oh, fine. You know what I'll do? I'll just go ask my super. You know why? Because he's probably the only one in this goddamn city that doesn't know what we did yet. Jamie: You're being a prick, Max. Mars girl: I can open it with my X-ray vision. You're always being a prick! You know, I'm thinking that I think that you're not thinking who you're talking to here! Sure I do. I'm talking to a prick. All right. That's it. Come on. Come here, you! Get back in the fucking car! You get out of the way! Aah! Ok, ok, ok. You will not hurt Jamie again. Max: What? What did I do? Jack: No, no! That's enough! Now, listen to me. We've got the case. Nobody's hurt. These are good things. We need to focus right now on getting the thing open. Does anyone have an idea on how to open the case? I can open it with my X-ray vision. Oh, girl. You shut the fuck up! Hey, enough already. I got an electric drill at home. There you go. Drill. Drill at home. Let's go. Max: I'll drop you off. You'll drop me off? Yeah. Yeah. We'll wait at the apartment. You can fucking walk. You ok, baby? Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Good. Yeah. That way, we'll walk back. There's a 7-Eleven. Maybe we could get some watermelon popsicles or something. Piece, we want to do this tonight, ok? You leave the girl with us, you go, pick up the fucking drill, and come back home. Enough already. Ok? Let's go. Come on. Piece: No. I have your solemn word that you will protect these women... Ha! If I leave them with...Whatever over there. Yes, you have my word. Yeah, yeah. I'm "whatever" now. Ok. Get in the car, please. Get in the car. Jamie: Oh, that's what you're so upset about. You wet your pants. You could have said so. Could we just all shut up for a while until piece comes back? I can open it with my X-ray vision. Get rid of her. Get her out of here. I am sorely tempted to tear her fucking tongue out. Come on. Let's go to my room, baby. Prick! Bye, Jack. Night, Mars girl. What? I didn't do anything! I didn't do anything! I am going to kill her. What? That white-faced, Lily-livered, jong-loving, hot-blooded whore talk to me like that. I can talk plenty. Did you hear the stuff that she was saying? Yeah. Were you a witness to that? I said yeah. I am not some hoodlum! I am not some lowlife scum that hangs around the street-corner store. No. What's a guy going to do, huh? I run a pretty tight ship, and that's truth under the circumstances of having more dependents than god, I might add. You'd think-- hey! I'm trying to put this kid to sleep! Then try harder! Jack, is he boring you? Do you want a break? No. No, no. There's not going to be any teaming up on me in my household, thank you! Did she tell you that she was in prison? She mentioned it, yeah. Juvenile. Yeah, but did she tell you why? No. She told you? Yeah, but she made me promise I can't tell you. I can't tell you. Yeah. Uh-huh, Jack. What'd she do? I...ok. I just think that under the circumstances, this is something you should know. Right. What'd she do? She killed her parents. Shh! All right. Stop, stop, stop. She told you that? Yeah, yeah. She said that, yeah. She's 10 years old, she gets taken out of the school play because she's not doing her homework, so little Jamie steals of jar of formaldehyde. Next thing you know, her parents are drinking it. Her own parents. It's a wretched, fucking thing. The hand that's feeding her-- chopping it the fuck off, but that's exactly what I thought! That's exactly-- fuck, I was right all along! About what? I mean, that's exactly it! She goes after the people that take care of her. Right, right. But she wants to be taken care of. I mean, that's the clincher. People that she can rely on, like me-- she... You know, she seeks us out. And the minute she's feeling, like, a little fenced in or something better comes along-- oh, I got it. Formaldehyde. Formaldehyde. Exactly. I thought you should know, Max. Max: I could wrestle her to the ground and choke her to death! I could tear her to bits! Do it, Max. Do it. Go in there and take care of business right now. Come on. Huh? No. It wouldn't work. She doesn't wrestle to the ground easy. You know, I'd have to take out my gun, shoot her... Hmm. Yeah. Wake up the neighbors. I thought you told piece you were going to protect the women. I lied. I like to lie. It makes me feel all tingly inside. It makes me really want to kick your ass. And you know what else? You know, with all this excitement, I forgot I wanted to kill you, too. Why? In the warehouse, your guy did not pull a gun, Jack. You didn't see anything. You know what I did see? What? When he got back up, he went like this. Now, you want to tell me how his gun got back in his holster? Hmm? This whole thing would have gone down clean if you hadn't bent it out of shape, Jack. You want to explain why it is you did that? I have my reasons. Yeah? They better be good. Yeah. I have reasons that don't concern you-- look, I will shoot you through the head. Ah, ah, ah, ah. You don't want to wake up the neighbors, huh? Oh, shit! Are you all right? Oh, you little shit! Is he here for me? Calm down, Max. What the hell is going on in there?! Nothing! You know, it's like having a mother in the house, you know? You know, I just want to kill so many people. This whole thing is getting... Way too complicated. Yeah. Well, you know what? Just worry about Jamie. As far as the events in the warehouse are concerned, you gave your protection. You know what, Max? You're going to get what's coming to you. Anything outside of that is my business. Leave it alone. Think so, huh? Yeah, I think so. Let me ask you a little question, Max. Why didn't we wait for piece? Why didn't we just pick up piece? You got a dead body you hadn't planned for. You got dirty prints all over an abandoned Van. You got 2 eyewitnesses. The only face they see is piece's, huh? It wouldn't be that you and Jamie are planning a little deviation of your own, would it? That's none of your business. Exactly. Piece will be here anytime now. So are we going to do this, or aren't we? Mm-hmm. So... I'm going to go and get something ready. As long as he's with you, he's leading these guys back to your front door. Leave him behind, the cops arrest him, and he's going to talk. It's the only thing you can do, Max. I know. Plus, now you get another share. Of course, you could have all 3 shares... If you wanted. Yes, I could. Yes. I'm just saying... If you think that she's going to do to you what she did to her own parents... Huh? No, she's not going to do that to me. Should I go get her? Ok. Jamie, showtime. Ok. Are you-- are you sure you want to do this? Someone has got to suffer. Yeah, but piece? He stood up for you when Max would have knocked your teeth out. What's your point, baby? Well, are you sure you're doing the right guy? Hmm? Yeah. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Just think about it, all right? Hurry. Go. Go, go, go, go, go. Shit. We were just talking about you, piece. Yeah? Jamie! Piece is here! Hey. Hey. Got the drill. Great. Wonderful. Anything strange happen on the way here? Yeah. No. Where's girl girl? Jamie: Sleeping. But, uh, anyone follow you or... No. What's going on? Max: Nothing. Try and open the case? Yeah. Where do i-- right there. Oh. Are you guys as excited as I am? Yeah? More. Jamie: Yeah. Watch my stuff! Watch my stuff! Max: No! No guns! I don't know where you live, but gunshots are reported in my neighborhood. Guys, thanks for the help. Well, we did it. All right. Let's get this body out of here till we're ready to dump it. Dead bodies. I don't like looking at them. But, uh, the girl is sleeping in the bedroom. Then we'll just-- we'll throw him in the bathtub. All right? Well, come on and grab his feet. Jack: Get the door. Jamie: Shh. You'll wake her. You know, Jack? Hmm? We were talking about that guy that you set us up to kill tonight for no reason. Remember? I remember the conversation. Yeah. I think I figured out the reason. Yeah? You want to hear it? It's probably not what you're thinking, Max. I think those boxes of yours are empty. I think... That there are no Spanish judges. I think... This was a setup from the beginning. You know, a little shooting, and, uh, you get paid for something you never even had. Oh, that's pretty-- pretty slick, Jack. We get paid, Max. As soon as you get that case open, we get paid. Funny. I'm beginning to think I'm getting rooked again. I mean, nothing has gone straight in this deal so far. He looks comfortable. Here. Let me do this. There's money in that case. The guy trusted me completely. Well, then he deserves what he got. Come on. Come on. Tell her to hurry up, Jack. Jack, will you tell him to back off? I'm trying to concentrate. What, the 2 of you can't talk to each other? Come on. You got something to say to me, just turn around and say it. Just stop pushing me, ok?! You're being such a baby about opening this thing! Maybe if you paid attention to what's been going on, you'd be worried, too. Or maybe it's just you just don't care anymore. Maybe you just want the whole case for yourself. Maybe you're thinking about formaldehyde. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about now. Mm-hmm. Please, the 2 of you-- you know what? This is just like you. You get so-- I mean, you get these paranoid fucking delusions about anything that is not under your control. And you're jealous of Jack because he's a successful man. Whoa. And he's got a big plan, and you've got a little tiny plan, and his case is going to be full of money, and if you just give me one fucking undisturbed moment to open it-- No. It-- open--uh, open it. Open the case. Ok. Um... Yes! Oh. Don't touch it. Let's just look at it for a few seconds. That's a million dollars. That is a million dollars. How much do you think is there? It's a million fucking dollars. A lot. How many of these do we get? Huh? 10...no. 15 each. Thank you, piece! Thank you. It's all there. Oh, my god, baby! I can't believe it. You stupid bitch! We finally did something! We finally did something! We finally did! We finally did! Ha ha ha! Aah! Whoo-hoo! Jack: Oh, my god. I can't even count this high. Ha ha ha! Hey. What the fuck is this? We got a lot of work still to do. Max, Jamie, come on. Get up! Max, you should let Jamie get on top... Because that's how it was when she was fucking me! Hmm. Sorry. Aah! Aah! Bastards. You... Shoot him! Oh! I told you, no shooting in the apartment! He's the one shooting! Give me my money! Max! Aah! Piece: Ah, you... Aah! See this? You see this? This is a dead body! That thing before-- that wasn't dead. This is dead. Don't blame this on me! Don't! Don't blame you? You poisoned him. Poison was not my idea. We couldn't have shots in our apartment! That was the whole idea! Your! Your apartment! I no longer have anything to do with you, with this place, or any of this! This time, it's fuck you. This is the end. The end. Jack: We have to leave right now. Right now, we have to go. What do you want to do with this, Max? Fine. Fuck you, too. Fine. Max, leave it. Forget about her. Leave it or go. What do you want to do? Hmm? We'll let the police take care of it. Let them earn their money. I'll get something. Good. Is he here for me? Go back to sleep! Why did you tell him? Why? What the hell did you do? We did. I just said it. Now, you want to spend the rest of your life with this guy or not? Make up your mind. Let's go. He's loading piece's body into the car. Are we going to do this? Uh, are you going to help me? Right? Come on. Pour 3 martinis. 3 martinis. 3. Jack: Mmm, mmm, mmm. You're a fucking liar, Jack. I don't know what about, exactly, but I know you are. Why should I trust you? Jamie, this whole thing between you and Max was set in motion way before I ever met you. I don't know if the part I like about you is even the real part. I want you to come with me to San Francisco. Why would I lie to you about that? What do I have to gain? We can introduce ourselves to each other all over again, ok? 2 very nice, very rich people that never have to get involved in crime ever again, ok? Then? Then we'll see what happens. Ok. I'm going to go and finish packing. Make sure that he gets the right one. It's this one, ok? This one. Ok? What about this, Max? Whose share is this going to come out of? It's her or me, right? Right? Never trust anything that bleeds for 5 days and doesn't die, right? Jamie, come on. We got to go. Let's go. Let's have our drinks, then, huh? All right. A toast. To 3 very clever people. May we--may we all get what we deserve. I loved you once, sister Mary Agnes. I loved you, too, brother pio. Wait. Stop. Aah! Aah! Jack, did you switch glasses? Oh, it hurts! Well, we'd better go. What did she mean about switching glasses? I don't know. Dying people say some pretty stupid shit. Huh? Drink up, Max. Let's go. We got to get out of here. I don't think so. What was this? Getting the money is not enough? Huh? Nothing is enough for people like you? Nothing?! Jack: Ow. Aww. Come on. Come on, you big fucking piece of shit, huh? Unh! Oh, you're garbage. You're fucking garbage. And you fucking smell like garbage! Come on. That's ok. That's ok. Get off my money! You piece of shit. I should have smelled you a mile away. I got played. I got played! I murdered sister Mary. Jack: Why don't you get away from her now, huh? You're not good enough for her. Get off her! Piece of shit. You killed her. And you're going to walk away with a lot of money for it, aren't you? Yeah. The money is nice... But it's nothing compared to the Spanish judges. You have them? No, Max. You did. You want to see that, huh? Huh? Want to see that? Come on. Get over here. Get over here. You see that? Made by Jean-Baptiste laroche in the galleries of the louvre. It was going to be a present for king Louis xv of France to king Charles iv of Spain. What does this say? Look at that. "Les juges"... I can't speak French. But they sure are pretty, aren't they? Huh? Circa 1760. Supposedly, Max, these are one of the finest sets of dueling pistols ever made. Now, personally, I don't like guns, but I do know fine things when I see them. Mmm, mmm, mmm. The little story I told you about-- remember the gentleman in the motel parking lot? Well, he'd sold the guns by the time we met with him, sold them on the black market, and then he'd sold them again and again and again... For a fraction of their worth. One million dollars. Oh, my god. Hidden this entire time in a graveyard of a fucking apartment. What a joke, Max. How many pretty sister Marys you have to kill for a million bucks, huh? Max: You think you know who I am, Jack? You haven't even met me yet. Max? Yes? When you were showing me the pistols... You only loaded one of them. Do you remember which one it was? No. Well... There's only one way to find out. Shit. This is a 200-year-old gun, Jack. I wonder what this gun would do to you. Think it'd kill you instantly? Or maybe it would just wound you, hmm? I could watch you bleed and squirm all night, like you've been doing to Jamie and I. You fuck. You fu-- you fucking cheap whore. Get down on your knees! Get down on your fucking knees! You beg Jamie to forgive you. Beg her! Mars girl: Fly! Fly! What's happening? Nothing, honey. Excuse me, Max. Come on. Is he here for me? No, he's not here. I got to tell you something, all right? Listen to me, honey. Come with me, all right? I can't leave you here. You know too much. As soon as we get outside of the city, I'll let you go. I'll even give you some money, all right? Go anywhere you want. Come on. No, thank you. I have to wait here for the man from Mars. I'm the man from Mars. Hey, I couldn't tell you before, because they would all have gotten very jealous, but I'm that guy. Come with me. You're not, though. Why, because I got scars? Everyone's got scars. No. They know what to do so their scars all heal up, but yours just keep on getting worse. There's no man from Mars. He's not coming. The only people that are coming are the cops, and you can't be here. You know too much. So tell me you're going to come with me, all right? No. Come on. Give me a big hug. Yeah. Please don't make me do something shitty here, ok? So tell me you'll come with me. No. I will do this, I swear. Please? Tell me you'll come with me. Let go of me. Policeman: Open up! Police! Police! Open the door! Police! Open the door now!
