Go back to the Foundling Home, you evil boy and pack your bag. TORN APART George! Wait for me! I'm going with you. We're going west on a motorcycle and will pick oranges. No, Pauline. You're too young. But I look older with my hair up. I'll lie about my age. Please, George. For the last time: you're just a baby. Stop being... a pest! All right! Then, go! Who needs you? I never loved you anyway. I never loved you at all. Pauline, look at me. Remember that day when we sneaked off and went to the park and saw the daffodils coming up? Oh, why can't you take me with you? I don't eat much. Then, when we went back they were in bloom. I won't eat anything. That's the way it'll be with you. Just grow up straight. When you're in full bloom, I'll be back. But that could take forever. No, it won't. Before you know it, you'll grow bigger and I'll grow rich. And then what, George? We'll get married and go on a honeymoon. Where? London, Paris, the whole world! Maybe even Venice. Go! I'll wait, George. I'll be a daffodil and bloom. Dry your tears, My pretty Pauline I'll be back, My pretty Pauline I'll make millions, You'll see what I mean Yes, I do promise, My darling Pauline. SEVEN YEARS LATER... FAR FROM HOME Splendid! First rate! I'm bored. Let me shoot a guard. Give me that. I'm a royal prince and you're not to touch me. Your highness, your highness! Your new tutor has arrived. Is she blonde and American? How did you find her, your highness? I saw her picture at the orphans office of employment. So I saved my allowance and sent away for her. Just a minute. What is this, boy? I'm starting my own harem. Your harem? You hired an innocent orphan to indulge in hanky panky? I should certainly inform your father about this. You do it and I'll slice your ears off. I'm Colonel Sten Martin of the Royal Blues. I wasn't hired only to teach you shooting, but also to develop your moral character. Haven't you got any morals? I'm sick of morals. Throw him over the wall and into the jungle. Take your hands off me! You can't do this to me! I gave up a commision from the British Army. I gave up a chance for a pension. I'll catch this damn child! Tell the American blonde that I'm ready to go to school. "My name is Pauline" Now, class, you might as well know that this is my first experience as a teacher. So, if I seem a little nervous, I know you'll bear with me. And if I make mistakes, I'm sure you'll forgive me. You'll be studying physical education and deportment. Let's start with deportment. -Are you engaged? -Oh, yes, your highness. Since I was about your age. His name is George. Where is he? He's looking for me. I know he is. -I mean, where is he now? -I don't know. Then you're engaged to me. Thank you, your highness, but I'm afraid my blood isn't royal enough. Be engaged to me or I'll cut your head off. It's very bad manners to threat your teacher with a scimitar. I'm a prince and you'll do as a I say. What we need is a better teacher-pupil relationship. Exactly. Doris, Boris, get her! Those are real sharks! -Now, will you? -Will what? -Kiss me? -Certainly not. All right. I'll give three. One... two... Why don't you scream? The others did. What others? My other tutors. It's more fun when they scream. Screaming was never allowed at the Baskerville Foundling Home. THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE A FOUNDLING HOME Hold it! Hold it! Stop it! What have you done? Who gave... Mrs. Carruthers! George Stedman! Back after 7 years! -What's going on here? -We're being demolished. -Where's Pauline? -I let her go with the others. -Adopted? -No. Poor girl! She was my only failure. There was a jinx on her. Just as you planned, sir. Plan? What plan? To keep her at the orphanage until he could come back and lay the riches of the world at her feet: Sable, jewels, chocolate... It was you who put the jinx on her! I should know. Don't you understand? I love her, Mrs. Carruthers. I've always loved her. He wrote her every day for seven years. -And I torn them up. -But why? I never told you this, George, you may have inherited evil tendencies. If he had, madame, he has overcome them. -He's made a fortune for her. -How big a fortune? He's rented Venice for their honeymoon. -The whole city? -Including the canals. Oh! And I thought it was only puppy love. How blind I was! Is she pretty, Mrs. Carruthers? She's beautiful. If you had come back 2 days ago before she left for Africa. Africa? Where in Africa? Basbah. To tutor a twelve-year-old prince in deportment and physical education. Not Prince Benji of Alabaris? His father and Mr. Stedman have a joint venture in oil. She was promised the protection of the royal family. Let's go, Thorpe. We'll take my jet. That kid is the worst delinquent since Ivan the Terrible. When they bite off your head it goes crunch. What are you doing playing with my sharks? He's just mischievous, your majesty. You'll have your harem when you're 18 and not before. Now go to your suite. You hurt my ear! It's really my fault, your majesty. you see, I haven't been able to establish a proper teacher-pupil relationship. He won't bother you again or I'll cut off his hand. Nothing can happen to you while I'm alive. I'll, drag you behind the racing camels. I'll have you squeezed by the royal python. All right! You can have a harem. Take mine. Oh, I don't want your old harem. I'm stuck with the teacher. Benji, Benji, I'm your sire. Doesn't it mean anything to you? A DEN OF SIN Good morning, teacher. Why was I bathed in oil? Why an I in this diaphanous knickers? Why am I a prisoner? And where's your father? He's taking a nap. I'm sorry about the sharks. I'm a bad boy. Oh, but you aren't hopeless. There's no such thing as a bad boy. A ruby carved like an apple! An apple for my teacher. Put it on. That's the apple of Arabia. As long as you wear it, we're married. This is inexcusable, your highness! Shame on you! Once and for all: I'm waiting for George. But George isn't here and Benji is! Now I have you. Yes, you have, you handsome thing. You've touched the strings of my heart. Kiss me on the cheek. I'll burn your hair! I'll paint you green! Get me out of this. Your excelency, your highness! Where did she go? To the royal garage, your highness. The royal garage. Go! Go! Hurry! Hurry! Faster! Faster! All right, New York. Over and out. Industries running fractionally. Rail steady. Utilities nervous. Thorpe, did I ever tell you that I took her to se the Statue of Liberty? Hurry, hurry! Oh, your highness! Have you seen an American girl? A beautiful square girl with diaphanous knickers? About 5.2 feet tall? No, your highness. She must be here. Search the whole place. I'll take this one. American girls bring a fortune in the Congo. The market survey we made last year disclosed a vacuum in cement industry here in Basbah. The local product is grainy and... Never mind the local cement. Where is that little monster? Mr. Stedman, greetings! Where's she? Where's Pauline? Pauline? Your new school teacher from America. Oh, that Pauline. She never got here. She fell off the boat. Then, what is this? Where's she? What have you done to her? Wall me up, your gangster? You're in house arrest. And no harem until you're 35. You hurt my nose! Mr. Stedman, greetings! How's our il company doing in Wall Street? Never mind Wall Street! Produce Pauline at once or you'll lose your oil and your country! Your majesty! News of the American tutor. She's on her way to the Congo to be sold to Bamble, the leader of the white pygmies in exchange for his horde of ivory. If I could drop a writ of plaintiff who would sign it? Forget that! We'll take the king's half track to the Zambezi River and then we'll go by canoe. Residence of Mr. William Sten Martin, notable white hunter. I'll see if he's in. Telephone, bwana. I'm having my dinner. What is my dinner? A nice zebra steak fried in monkey fat. Again? Zebra, zebra, zebra. Can't you cook anything else? Sten Martin here. This is prince Benji. Yes, your highness! I have a job for you. I will pay you a princely fortune. An American girl named Pauline is about to be sold to Bamble. Get her and bring her back to me. Yes, sir. Get my Mauser gun. I'm going up the river. Ah! Look what you're getting. She's a beautiful American Blonde. And she's a hard working orphan. And she doesn't belong to the Peace Corps. OK. I make deal. You, new queen! Sit on throne. Oh, thank you very much, but I'm afraid I'm too big for it. You see, I'm 34-22-34. You drink and you'll be little like us: 17-11-17. No wonder the prince wanted you back. You're 34-22-34. Just fine for a short safari. Benji will never see you again. Where am I? You're in the great green greasy banks of the Zambezi River. Gosh! And who are you? William Sten Martin, notable white hunter at your service, my dear. I am an American citizan looking for employment. Can you take me to civilization? White pygmies! My canoe is just over the hill. Quickly! Why go looking for a job when you could stay here with me in my hunting lodge below the high river dam. You'd love it! Every night when the sun sets over the savannah, I'll, bring you fresh meat: rhinos, zebras... I love a nice sunset, but I don't believe I know how to cook a zebra. You fry it in monkey fat. And every night afer dinner, we'll sit by the fire and laught out loud with the hyenas. We used to laugh so much at the Foundling Home. Sometimes we ran out of oatmeal and we'd just sit around and George would tell us funny stories for dinner. Poor unhappy child! You're a federal judge. What are the marriage laws among these natives? There's no divorce among the white pygmies. Dear Pauline, take the word of a man of the world. He's abandoned you. What worries me is that she must think that I've abandoned her. He'll find me no matter where I am. Sometimes I fell he's just around the corner. We've passed the island. There's a whirl ahead when the sill way of the dam is open. Everything comes to those who wait. Pauline, life is a jungle. Why go through it as a lonely school teacher? Lonely?! With so much to do in the world? I'll get into something: Urban renewal, the poverty program, maybe help the blind. I could be somebody's eyes. No, no, Pauline, listen to me. I have a confession to make. I was to be paid a princely fortune to return you to Benji, but I fell in love with you at first sight. Marry me, Pauline! Thank you very much, Mr. Sten Martin. I appreciate the offer, but I'm engaged to George. Don't move! Don't panic! Hippopotami? Yes, and with hunger. Keep still. I'll shoot past your head. Now, you listen to me: I want her back! Did you hear? Back! Go in jungle with white hunter. Wait a minute! Message coming in. White hunter and girl down river. Attacked by hippos. Should I wire the Duce and cancel Venice? Negative. Back in the canoe. I have one more shoot left. Mr. Sten Martin, your eyes are all black. I can't see, I can't see. Take over. We're approaching white waters. Aim to the hydroelectric plant on the right. I'll try to low the water level. Where are we now? On the 7th floor of the New York Mercy Hospital. Just down the hall from the chapel. Pauline, I can't let you do this: marry a blind man... Well, you saved my life, Willy. You gave up a princely fortune. It's the least I can do. -What's the matter with him? -He's almost drawn in the great green greasy banks of the Zambezi River. His lungs are full of vicious African organisms. 7th floor. CHAPEL And now, I pronounce you man and... Wait! You stepped over the soap. You can see! You tricked me. You're a fake! Well, I was blind, but unfortunately I got better. You know what I think: A man can't be out in the jungle too long. And zebra cooked in monkey fat can have something do with it too. That's right. It twisted my mind. I understand you, Willy. But I don't love you. Marry me anyway, Pauline. I'll do anything. I'll go blind. Come, my son. I'll take you to the psychiatric ward in the annex. Mrs. Carruthers! Pauline! What are doing scrubbing floors? Why aren't you at the Baskerville Foundling Home? It's a bowling alley now. I could have stayed down as a pinsetter. But i'm not as agile as I used to be. I know! The apple of Arabia. It'll buy a new foundling home. -If I can get it off my finger. -Dip it in the soaped bucket. Isn't it wonderful, Mrs. Carruthers? Something good comes out of everything. Oh, Pauline, you're a sweet girl. The orphans will praise your name. Oh, please, could we call it the George Stedman in Foundling Home? Pauline, there's something I must tell you. Two days after you left, George came back. He did? Oh, where is he? Where did he go? To find you. Just as you always hoped. He's rented Venice for your honeymoon. Venice! George! George! Oh, George! Is it really you? Pauline! -You're so pale! -You're so beautiful! Did I bloom, George? Am I a daffodil? A whole bouquet. -Now we'll be together always. -Always, Pauline! Don't touch him! He's full of vicious African organisms. -What are his chances? -One in a million. Does he know? He was told when he came though customs. It's almost spring, George. Oh, it's just a common cold, Pauline. There are wonderful drugs now. Of course, I'll be hopping around in no time. Then we'll go to Venice. Yes, and we'll get the Piazza San Marco and turn it into a playground for the children. Oh! The tragedy of it all! We waited so long, George. A few more days won't matter. Of course not, Pauline. I'll see you in a little while. Oh, Pauline, one in a million... No! He's good and kind. He'll be the one in a million. Oh, George, I'll nurse you back to health. You're kind and good, Pauline. First, we'll need some white shoes, a white dress and a... If anything happens to me, you'll be the richest woman in the world. I wonder if Gimbels is still open. Pauline! -Did you see that? -Right into the sewer. Where does it come out? Somewhere in the dark Atlantic. Stafford! Yes, sir? Break off a piece of that seaweed. It's good for my throat. Yes, Mr. Coleman. Gosh! Where am I? You're washed ashore in the impregnable state of Casper Coleman. The second richest man in the world. -Who are you? -My name is Pauline. I'm engaged to George Stedman, the richest man in the world. Get her into the house, Stafford, Yes. -And call Dr. Reinhart. -Oh, yes, sir. MEANWHILE BACK AT THE PSYCHIATRIC WARD You see I would have taken her out of the snow. -Please... -Honestly! Face it, man. You're 18 years too late. The group is right. It's impossible to get between them. Their love is, if you pardon the word, sacred. Well, if their love is sacred, mine should be profane. Oh, Martin, get hold of yourself. Out of my way! I want her, I need her and I'm going to have her! It can't be true, Thorpe. It can't be true. Try to be calm, sir. You're full of wonder drugs. How can I... How can I stay calm? I want every sewer searched, every coast line dragged. I've got to find Pauline. Where is she? Where is she? -Much better today. -Aha! Just rest and keep warm. All right! Go on my dear, what happened next? Well, then I fell into this hole. And the next thing I knew I was emptied in the dark Atlantic. What a brave girl, sir! Oh, I'm not brave. I'm just lucky. George is the brave one. May I use your telephone to call the hospital? I'll reverse charges. Yesterday, my dear, while you were under sedation, I checked his condition. He's in a coma and taking no calls and now, my dear, you need a little nap before lunch. Nurse! Take Pauline to her room. But sir, the hospital said that George Stedman had made a remarkable recovery and is convalescing at home. I couldn't tell her that, you idiot! She'd go to him. I want that courage and gallantry and I'm going to have it. But sir, you're 99 and a half years old. You subsist on cookies and mother's milk. It's not for myself. I'm going to marry her to my grandson Dwayne. -Bring my grandson! -Bring his grandson! That's my grandson! Wedding bells for you, my lad. Wedding bells. You like that, uh? Won't you? But the disparity in their ages, sir? Pauline is 19, whereas Dwayne is only one. When he's 21, she'll be 40! Reinhart? You're the head of my laboratories. Think of a solution. It's quite simple: Freeze her. Freeze her? I don't follow. The girl is 19, your grandson, one. Freeze her for 25 years and then your heir will pass her. By then, Dwayne will be 26 and Pauline will still be a blushing 19. We can use the lab. Of course, all we need is her consent. Oh, yes, yes. We'll put something in her tea. TEA TIME Drink your tea, my dear. Hum! It's delicious. Thank you. We used to drinks lots of tea at the Baskerville Foundling home. On chilly afternoons like this, George would make a big pot and we'd all have a cup before taking our naps. He said the sugar would give us sweet dreams. Gosh! I fell sleepy already. To the laboratory! My crews have cruised every sewer in New York City, sir. I've branched every inch of the Atlantic Ocean coastline and there's no trace of Pauline. Well crawl and drain some more. I want her found. Did you hear it? Yes, sir. Stedman speaking. -For you. -Thank you, sir. This is Thorpe. Oh, hello Stafford. Oh yes, we are. She is? I can't believe it! Yes. Yes, I'll tell him. Thank you, Stafford. Goodbye. Tell me what? Who was that? Casper Coleman's male secretary. Pauline was washed away in the old tycoon's private beach. He plans to marry her to his grandson. But that's ridiculous! His grandson is only one year old. He solved that problem. He's reducing Pauline to a state of torpor, then freezing her for 25 years. That monster! I don't think it's legal, but on the other hand, the estate is impregnable. If Stafford works for Coleman, why did he confess to you? There's a secret confraternity between male secretaries, sir. 25 years! I'll be 50! She'll still be sweet 19. January and June marriages are sometimes the happiest, sir. Get me the head of my laboratories. She catches a cold just so easily, Thorpe. Did you know that? She had pneumonia once. I rubbed her back with goose grease. Just the thought of her shivering in that ice... Doctor, Stedman. How soon can I be frozen up for 25 years? Almost immediately. It's a simple technique. Much like making an ice cube in your refrigerator, sir. -May I ask why you? -No, doctor. Yes you may not. Just get things ready and I'll be right along. But the risk, sir, the danger to your life. Without Pauline, life is just not worth living. Just think, Thorpe. In 25 years I'll be just like I am now. She'll be just like she is, a as fresh as beautiful as ever. It'll be a bright brand new world! Sir, I have a request to make. May I have the honor of freezing up by your side? Thank you, Thorpe, but someone must stay behind and run the empire. But sir, I don't have your razor sharp mind. We're ready, Mr. Stedman. Just step over here. If you just lie down inside and make yourself comfortable. Your certified check for a million dollars, sir. You'll need some spending money when you wake up. Any last minute instructions, sir? If Pauline wakes up before I do, keep an eye on her. Yes, sir. Proceed, doctor. Goodbye, sir. Goodbye, sir. Not goodbye, Thorpe. Just adios. What's happening to her now? She's just descending to a state of torpor. Fill the container with tap water. -Mr. Coleman. -Ah! A visitor, Mr. Otto Falsone. He says that after George Stedman and yourself, he's the third richest man in the world. Falsone? Reinhart, go on with the freezing, I'll be back. -Stafford, mother's milk for two. -Yes, sir. Well, Falsone, come, come, come. I only got a minute. If you are who you say you are, how come I've never heard of you? Well, let's say, I'm somewaht of a recluse. People annoy me. That's why I spend most of my time on my estate in furthermost Canada. And I have a little proposition for you, sir. I'm making one of my rare visits. -Furthermost Canada? -Yes. How do you get your money? Well, suffice to say that my mother was a very good friend with the late Shah of Kuwait. The Shah? Himself? Well, uh... What is your proposition? I understand you have a grandson. How would you like him to be the richest man in the world? How could he be as long as George Stedman is around? Ah, thank you. You see, my daughter in law has just presented me with a granddaughter. Now you are the second richest man in the world, I'm the third. Their betrothed would combine two fortunes. Stafford, let the little blonde go. Yes, sir. Unfreeze the blonde! Coleman's orders. It may be too late. A toast to the youngsters, uh! What is your granddaughter's name? Henrietta. To Dwayne and Henrietta, the richest young couple in the world. -What did you say this was? -That is mother's milk. -I'm 99 and a half. -Is this tea? I prefer it. Oh, well it's not tea. In fact it is... Oh, dear! Thank you. Delicious, thank you. You were saying just now something about letting a little blonde go. Well... Between you and me, it gets rather cold and lonely up there in furthermost Canada. I was wondering if you might consider passing her over to me, I... Third richest man in the world, are you? Imposter! He's well and waiting for you. Oh I knew he'd be the one in a million. Once out of the gate, turn left and catch agreen bus. Here's some money for your fare. -Thank you. -Stafford! Oh, the address is 163 Park Avenue. Go! Stafford! Guards! Guards! Stafford, where are you? Oh, it feels dazzle. A bit rude of me. And what about the blonde? Stafford! Pauline, the little blonde, where's she? Unfrozen, sir and gone. Gone? Gone? In which direction? Guards! Seize this imposter. Walk him over, then toss him over the wall. Come on, you... Pauline! I caught a green bus and got here as fast as I could. Where's George? But Casper Coleman froze you for 25 years. Yes, but I'm 96? now, besides it was just an old man's love for his grandson, Dwayne. Where's George? I can't wait to see him. He's in here. This may be a little difficult, my dear. Brace yourself. But where's George? George! But why? When he heard you were frozen, he made the decision himself. He didn't want to burden you with his declining years. I offered to freeze by his side, but someone had to run the empire. Oh, did he say anything else about me? He said: life without my Pauline is not worth living. 25 years from now, I'll be just as I am and she'll be just who she is, as fresh and beautiful as ever and it'll be a brand new bright world. Oh, George, it will be a brand new world. Only... Only in 25 years, I'll be 44 and he'll be only 25. January and June marriages are sometimes the happiest. Oh no! Get an ice pick quick, turn on the oven. No, my dear, a rapid thaw would kill him. 25 years isn't so long, George. I'll get a comfortable chair and some good books and will wait to be together. He could be defrosted slowly, a little every day, preferably by sun light. Yes, a warm climate, but where? And how? The mean temperature in the Gulf of Aden is 130?. I'll order the schooner off the moth balls. Yes, yes. Oh, George! It will be a brand new world. It's delicious. What is it? Port? -It's vanilla extract. -Sorry. So, you weren't around when she was left on the doorstep... So, I was left on a doorstep. I'm still here. STEDMAN SCHOONER DEPARTING TODAY FOR THE GULF OF ADEN And that's the end of chapter 3, George. These people have long names! Chapter 4. Lara lays feverish and half conscious in Feliciata Semiovna's bed. The Sventitskys, the servants and Dr. Zhivago were talking in whispers... And sell the coppers after Wall Street closes, merge the Detroit plant with Montreal electronics. Thorpe out. That's all for the day, my dear. He's beginning to drip. We'll finish the chapter tomorrow, George. Where are we today? Approaching the Mediterranean. Just off the coast of Brittany. Better break out to southwestern. The captain said we're running into rough weather. There's a roaring fire in the basement sallon, shall we go below? I just hope he isn't seasick. A gastric disturbance is impossible in the state of torpor. Are you sure those ropes will hold? I checket them myself, my dear. Now come below. You're getting drenched. Look! Oh, George, wait for me! -No, no! -Easy, easy. Please, let me go with George. Let go of me. Please, please, let me go. Hold on, my dear. Please, miss, do you want to wind up in Davy Jones's locker? Anywhere, as long as I'm with George. How come you don't stop the boat? In this weather? The barometer is still falling. Now come below. Please, let me go. Oh! Keep your spirit up, George. You'll wash ashore somewhere. SEARCH ABANDONED FOR GEORGE STEDMAN LOST AT SEA Closing Dow Jones average up 6.5. You made 3 million dollars before lunch. Mr. Stedman would be proud of you. Money. What is money without love? I can't go on, Thorpe. What you need is a change of scene. Somewhere where you can meet some nice young swingers. Somewhere like the Riviera. He's alive, Thorpe. I know it. He's some place... somewhere. Just floating around. Your love may be sacred, but I'm here now and you're here. And you'll never get Pauline. Never! Never! Never! Never... Uh! What am I doing? You're my life boat. I must be going crackers! This blasted sun! The French Riviera! Trash! Trash! Immature trash! How can I follow my greatest epic: "Life Equals Two and a Half" with a story like this where innocence triumphs? Innocence has never triumphed in a Frandisi film. -You know that. -Don't you know that? Wait a minute! Maybe we can switch it around. Let innocence be destroyed. It will win every festival in Europe. Naturally. But who's going to play it? Where does one find innocence? Nah! There's no more innocence in this dolce vita. Just the sound of rats and feet on broken glass. That's it! She's innocence herself. Sign her at once. Tell her that she's fallen under the far out eye of the talented Frederico Frandisi. Look! We're being signaled. If my navy days serve me correctly, you've come under the talented far out eye of Frederico Frandisi. He wants to make you an international symbol of innocence. And will you have dinner with him tonight? Oh, that's very sweet of him, but I haven't been very hungry lately. Do you think George isn't melted by now? Wait! Pauline! Where am I? Who are you? I am Colonel William Sten Martin, sir, formely with the British Army. I found you floating in ice in the coast of Britanny and I saved your life. Look, there's a cafe over there. Why don't we go and have a glass of Cinzano and talk it over? Yes? You're rather saucy, actually . And so there was nothing else for me to do but to have myself frozen for 25 years. But what was I doing off the coast of Britanny? What were you doing there? Hum? Oh, I was going to Singapore. I saw you floating by and the captain wouldn't stop. So I just dived and pushed you here. What else could I do? Dear sir, you deserve a reward. You shall have it. Oh, I don't think so. A certified check. Any bank in the world will cash that. Here you are. And thank you. A million dollars? A million dollars? What's my life worth? Quite. May I give you some advice? Please. Why don't you get frozen up again? I mean, if this girl is attractiveas you say she is, she's worthy that. The longer you wait, the older you'll get. I intend to. But first, I'd like to call New York to see if there's any news of her. Oh, I hate to ask. Would you mind lending me a few dollars? That million was all the change I had. I'm sorry, old chap. I never lend money. A wise policy. L'addition, monsieur. Oh, I'm sorry. I can't pay it. You see I've just arrived in Saint-Tropez in a keg of ice and I have no money. Il est arriv? ? Saint-Tropez dans un bloc de glace. Bloc de glace? C'est impossible! Je vais faire quelque chose. Are you a nut, monsieur? In which case I'll take you at once to the insane asylum. Or you are an American deadbeat, in which case we will consult the proprietor, who is my cousin. Of course! RUSSIAN CONSUL GENERAL ENGLISH AND CHINESE SPOKEN HERE Rent one of our space vehicles is impossible. Please, hear me out. I have a certified check for one million dollars. I would perfectly hand this over to you if you would only put a certain lady and myself in orbit for four days. That's all I ask. From the Kremlin. Urgent! RED ALERT- TO ALL CONSULATES IRMA SUICIDE RATHER THAN WALK IN SPACE WITH WOLF OF CRIMEA... NO LOCAL GIRL AVAILABLE TO FIT SUIT SIZE 34-22-34... FIND ONE! BLAST OFF AT DAWN. "K" What are the young lady's measurements? Ah, 34-22-34, five feet three. So you can understand why I'm so keen to orbit. -Sit down. -Here? Thank you. You see, apart from a short safari on the Zambezi River, we've hardly been alone. On second thought, it can be arranged. There's a space vehicle leaving tomorrow morning. We'll fly you and the lady to Moscow tonight. Bless you. -And the check? -The what? Oh yes, of course. -Where do we find this young lady? -The young lady? Oh yes. Tonight she's having dinner at the Caf? Chez Amour. We'll take care of everything. Excuse me, forgive me... Shouldn't we have tickets? -Tickets? -Of course. We'll meet you outside the Caf? tonight. Have a Cinzano while you wait. Ah, thank you. Charming. A Cinzano, please. Pardon, monsieur. You're wanted at the telephone. Thank you very much. Excuse me, my dear. Who are you? Gosh! Secret agents from Washington DC, our nation's capital! We've been watching you for days. We need you to perform a valuable service behind the Iron Curtain. I'd be glad to, but I have to go back to New York and run the George Stedman empire. What flag flies over you? Stars and stripes. Gosh! That's better! The Moscow plane leaves at 00h30. We'll pick you at precisely 00h01. We'll brief you on the way. They want me back at the hotel. Some mix over a peach umbrella. Shall we go? Oh, you go. I'll just stay here and listen to the music. Yes, yes. Have a Shirley Temple. I'll be back as soon as I get this straight out. Peach umbrella? Peach umbrella... Miss, step into the kitchen. The boss said you can take five in the alley. Gosh! You're both secret agents from Washington DC, just like the other two Americans. They are not Americans. They are Marshal Malekowsky and Colonel Nifer of the Russian secret police posing as diplomats. They are luring you to Moscow to take a walk in space. -Why me? -You fit the suit. Gosh! I'm glad you warned me. I wont' go. Yes, you will as a double agent for us. It will save millions of dollars -and thousands of lives. -How? Once you're out on space, you can photograph the instrument panel in the capsule. Here's your camera. It'll fit in your left ear. Well, raise your right hand and repeat after me. -For flag and country. -For flag and country. I promise to perform this dangerous mission. I promise to perform this dangerous mission. Behind the Iron Curtain at risk of torture and death, Behind the Iron Curtain at risk of torture and death, I will go to my grave with the secret. I will go to my grave with the secret. -So help me God. -So help me God. When we leave, go back to yur table. -Pauline! -George! -Oh, Pauline, I thought you were... -And I thought you were... Let's not talk about it now. -Later. -Yes. In the moonlight And in the morning, Venice! Oh, yes, yes, yes. -I mean, no. -No? I mean, I hope so. Oh, George, hold me. Oh, it's been a wonderful evening, George. Just like at the Baskerville Foundling Home. You washing, me drying. We'll have a lifetime of wonderful evenings, Pauline. We'll never be separated again. What time is it? -A minute to twelve. Why? -No reason. Tell me again, how is it going to be, please. Well, we'll be married in Venice and we'll take he schooner on a long honeymoon. Six times around he world. And we'll settle down and raise a family. Blondes like you and they'll grow up and have more blondes like you and we'll visit them on Sundays. Oh, George, no mater what happens, remember I'll always love you. Pauline, you're trembling. That's nothing. Just the chilly Saint-Tropez nights. We're finished here. I'll get my coat and take you back to the hotel. We're due to the airport. You have o hurry! Pauline! I LOVE YOU, PAULINE. P.S.: NO MATTER WHAT. No matter, what?! Anything else, monsieur? Ah, there you are. -Hurry! We're off to jolly old Moscow. -She is, you're not. What? Pauline! Pauline! Pauline? What about Pauline? Where is she? I gave the Russians your million to put us in orbit and now -He's taken her off to Moscow. -You idiot! Deadbeat! Mr. Stedman, you're out of your ice! I'm out of my mind! Come on! We're off to Moscow! What? Stop it! Don't you... We're in space... Hey, hey listen... I want Pauline back to the ground right now! Or I'll break your economy. I'll smash the rouble. Do you understand? I want her back now! Impossible! Yes, impossible. Her partner cut her umbilical cord. She's floating in space with all the capitalistic junk. What does that mean? She'll gradually lose altitude an burn at reentry. Mr. Stedman! Mr. Stedman! They would be married in Venice this morning. I don't know what this has done to him. Seems to be in a state of shock. The solution is simple: brainwash him. Remove her memory from his consciousness. But where would I have this done? And by whom? Take him to Dr. Gunther Blitz in Western Berlin, the neurological genius of the Kurf?rstendamm any Monday, Wednesday and Friday. On Tuesdays and thursdays, he's in his office in Eastern Berlin. Oh, he'd never consent to it. He'd rather live with his pain. Doctor Blitz's methods are very subtle. He wouldn't even know that his brain has been laundered. Introduce him as a casual friend of yours. Come, sir. I'd like you to meet a casual friend of mine who lives in Western Berlin. Any Monday, Wednesday or Friday. Commisar! What's this, Pushkin? A first in space! A triumph for Mother Russia. Pauline was snagged by a second capsule, landed in the suburb and was rushed here by a fast People's Republic automobile. Vodka for everyone! I'm a double agent for the USA. Do you have the photographs? How do I know you're a double agent? Not here! -Now, where's the photograph? -It's in my left ear. Lean your left ear towards me. If I'm a heroine of the Soviet Republic, how do I get out of Russia? Your escape from Moscow has been arranged. Go to the corner of Petruskovich St. and Melanvascovich St. where -you'll be contacted. -Petruskovich and Melanvascovich. Checked! But how do I get over the Berlin Wall? That's your problem. After the parade, they plan to kill you with injections of formaldehyde and exhibit you in a glass coffin next to Lenin. So, hurry. CHECK POINT EMIL Is this the one? Yeah! Get the formaldehyde. How do you feel tonight, sir? Still bothered by the little buzzing noise in your head? Uh? It's down to steady now. Listen to that, Thorpe! Some poor devil is trying to come in from the cold. -George! -Hello, who are you? -I'm Pauline. -How do you do? Welcome to Western Berlin and freedom. I'm going back to the hotel, Thorpe. That hum is back to a buzz. Why doesn't he know me? He's just been brainwashed by Dr. Gustaf Blitz, the neurological genius of Kurf?rstendamm. All memory of you has been erased from his consciousness. But why? When we heard you'd burn up in reentry, it seemed the kindest thing to do. Oh, George! Is this permanent? It'd better be for sake. There's one further complication: when you were washed out of his brain, so was his razor sharp acumen. His mind is clean and so is his bank account. I know! You take him to Switzerland, where they have strong psychological detergents and I'll go to Venice and star in Freddie Frandisi way out movie. I'll make a fortune for all of us. Pauline, you're one in a million. Oh, gosh no! George is one in a million. I see you in Venice. DR. RINSO'S SANITARIUM, GENEVA Now, see, as a former federal judge you understand that reversing a laundry job by Dr. Blitz is like breaking some Japanese code. What we need is an image or a key word. Something to trigger his subconscious memory. Ah, here we are. Good morning, sir. Doorstep? Baskerville Foundling Home? Zambezi River? American T&T? -Saint-Tropez? -Oh, stop, Thorpe! If I ever knew a Pauline, I don't know her now. I'm sick of this sanatorium. I'm checking out. Some flowers, sir. Daffodils. Daffodils? Daffodils! And when I come back, they'll be in bloom. And I came back. Yes... And she was like a daffodil. And she had bloomed for me. Where's Pauline, Thorpe? Aha! You see! Excuse me, please. She's in Venice, making a film under the talented far out eye of Freddie Frandisi. A WAY-OUT MOVIE Oh, wonderful, wonderful! Now the prince in the story... Sit down. Sit down. The prince in the story is a Hamlet like figure. He's a philosophical brooding, full of self doubts. He represents the modern man today with a story between bestiality and innocence. Gosh! Yes, gosh! Now, in this scene, he must make the decision. As you come down these stairs, the prince, he unlocks the handcuffs and you enter the gorilla cage, see? And with your charm, you invite him out to have dinner at that table. But your beauty arouses in him the low animal nature... as it does mine. He takes you in his arms and he embraces you and he wants to take you up the stairs... A real gorilla? He was as tame as a kitten until he saw you. You afraid, uh? She's afraid! Oh, no, there's nothing to be afraid, no, because the gorilla bedroom has two cages. Now, when the gorilla goes inside, the stuntman in a gorilla costume, he goes inside, locks up. Then the stuntman, he comes out when you call him. You think I would endanger your precious life, uh? You think so? Thank you, but I think only fair to tell you I belong to George. Check your costume with the wardrobe lady. Yes, maestro. But you didn't dig innocence, maestro. It was before I fell in love. I'm thinking of the new production now. An American classic. "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm". I love her. I love her. -Mrs. Carruthers! -Pauline! What are you doing here? Why aren't you at the George Stedman Foundling Home? When George's mind went kaput, we had to close it. So I took this job as a way-out wardrobe woman. Don't worry, Mrs. Carruthers, we'll open the Foundling Home again. Just as soon as I make a fortune. -You're a dear sweet girl, Pauline. -Frandisi is ready! Excuse me, Mrs. Carruthers. I have to go into the gorilla's cage and arouse his low animal nature. Oh no, Pauline. Must you? Yes, George needs the money. -Mr. Frandisi. -S?! My name is George Stedman. I'm here to tell you that this movie is over. George, her George! Get out, you square. -Action, please. -Insults will not make me leave. -Where's Pauline? -Shh. Quiet! Now... open the cage. And we will see which is the stronger: Sacred love... or profane love? Oh, I just locked... Just a minute! I know you. Yes, I shot you in the jungle, outside Basbah White Pigmy country, yes? We have the same reason. Obviously you're after Pauline, aren't you? You worked your way from Africa on a frighter. And then from Naples in a blue train. You're not gonna get her! I'm going to get her... Gorilla! Gorilla! Don't you like me, Gorilla? I won't hurt you, Gorilla. Come on! Don't be shy! Wouldn't you like to come along and get some dinner, Gorilla sweet? Come on! Cut! Magnificent! He... outfought me! You fool! Pauline! DANGER! EXIT TO THE CANAL Pauline, are you hurt? Oh, George! We're together and we're in Venice! Innocence! I hate innocence! Man should live by his hatred. Toto, cancel Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm. The bells, the bells! Oh George, listen to the bells. They're playing for us. And they will on this day every year for as many years as long as there are stones in Venice. Thorpe arranged it. Oh, the glory of the glory! Where are you, My pretty Pauline? I will search the world for Pauline. By jet, by steamboat or by submarine. This I do promise, My pretty Pauline. If you're in peril, Try not to scream, Hang on, I'll save you, My pretty Pauline. Transcription: Rosita McCartney Subtitling and Sync: Walter Santos
