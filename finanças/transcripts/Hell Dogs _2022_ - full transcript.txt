Mad Dog. Homemade feed? Fish meal, oyster shells, HB 101, mushrooms-- two types. Good chicken. Free-range. Akira Edogawa. Nadi… your brother. When? When what? You kill. Akira, five years ago. Nadi, last year. And the other three? Oh, you know. You know… I… out of game now. Still, though, you must atone. Shorty Jap. "The woodland lake of Nemi-- Diana's Mirror… The grove of Aricia… There prowls a priest, King of the Wood. He seeks to kill a man, and… having killed him, is soon killed himself." Officer? There's been a murder. I'm going to a movie. With Goro Idezuki on Sunday! You go, girl! -I'm jealous. -I'm nervous! -Will I be okay? -You'll be fine. Do you think so? What the…? We can't do this! Wanna die, too? POLICE Urgent! Second Street, Shinjuku! Chief. Mad Dog was killed. -Witness protection guy? -A former cop killed him. -Where is he? -We drugged him. -Any trouble? -Some, during transport. Goro Idezuki, a cop in Shinjuku ten years ago. There was a robbery at a supermarket. Three girls and a lady working there were killed. They arrested one guy five years later. He was never charged. He was found dead a month later. Goro Idezuki was AWOL from Rapid Response Unit 4. Likely been hunting them down. Killed 'em all. -I wonder why. -In love with one of the girls? Revenge? For a girl you never even held hands with? That's dysfunctional, son. We can give you a second life. Undercover agent. -Who is "we"? -Metropolitan Special Crimes-- -Who are you? -I'm Chief Anai. Undercover agent. Go into Toshokai. The fifth boss died four years ago. A war broke out over who would take over. The Ujiie family, the "Expelled" vs the Kozu family. -Remember? -I was in Mumbai. It's the biggest family in Kanto, 7000 strong. Non-expansionist yakuza. Tokyo-based. Cozy with authority. A former cop mediated the feud. Kozu became the sixth boss. He created a legitimate business as a front, like the mafia. Go on ahead. No one carried weapons in public. So, the Expelled snuffed him. The seventh boss of the family chosen to lead the revenge wasn't Toki, or the "Bear," Kumazawa, or Chuji, the consigliere. Chuji has no nose? Bitten off. He wears a sharkskin mask. Toake, the secretary, was chosen. A highly unusual selection. He follows Kozu's ways. Also supports overseas expansion. A hybrid unit of the Kozu and Mikami families. AKA Hell Dogs. That's Slick, the Mikami boss. Toake uses them to fix problems. His reach abroad has grown. The top earners are members in Brazil, Philippines, Uganda-- -Uganda? -Ivory trade. Toshokai is involved in elephant poaching. Hell Dogs is in Bangkok. That's Muro. Go pick a fight. Join the Hell Dogs. It's your test. Why him? Why not target the top guy? You and Slick are oil and water. This kid and I will get along? 98% work compatibility. With Slick, under 10%. The rest are below 50%. Potential lovebird? Muro's parents were leaders of Veda. The cult? Yes. Executed for mass murder. Muro is a yakuza psychopath. Wicked and wild. Wants to be a hero. Same as you. Fighting in the dark. Say we hit it off. What-- Destroy the Expelled. Climb the ranks. -What then? -And then? Into the darkness. Your contract and passport. You know the callers in Kabuki-cho? "Hot girls over here! Convenient girls!" No cop has fallen so low as you. You're a convenient man, Shogo Kanetaka. SHOGO KANETAKA Want some, Tak? -No. -No? -No rice balls? -No. I'm gassed. Finally! I'm gonna kill it today. I wanna go the hell home. Which one? The usual. -Is that like a ritual? -What? Everyday. Take out the toolbox. Ask me which one. I say the usual. You line up body bags. Who knows if they'll come? I guess. It's a ritual. Maybe. Ready? Damn! -And this? -Maintain this position. Keep it here, and… Why? -Elbows tight. -Elbows tight. -Make sure to control his hand. -Control it. -Squat down. -Squat. Down. I did it. I did it. You didn't. It's so hard! I'm dizzy. I wanna get this! Here. He gets me and… You're hopeless. -I'm hungry. -You had 12 rice balls. When I was a kid, I spent six months on IVs on an empty stomach. What? My parents were members of the Veda Revelation. -Veda, as in-- -Yup. The scary cult. Never knew that. 'Course not. Only the boss and the Kozu Trio know. Is that from Mr. Jaw? -They're coming. -When? -In 15 minutes. -Oh, shit! This will be useful. How's security? Airtight. My men are on guard 24-7. See the amenities? And the hot springs? -Not yet. -I see. How about golf tomorrow? Then the hot springs? But our boss doesn't like to golf. -Big bro's the only one who's good. -He's on another level. -You mean Tiger? -People call him "Tiger Woods." -What's here? -This is the great hall. Amazing! Contraband, torture… Perfect for anything. We can even have a circus. -It's like from Spartacus. -How much? There's more to see over here. How much? Just a moment-- Mr. Jaw, you understand… Stop! Please! Stop. Don't. I'm sorry, I… Please, please, don't-- Hush. Crush it… and crush it! There it is. Over here. You smokin'? That a cigarette in your mouth? -I'm going to school 'em. -Don't kill 'em. -Evenin'. -Evenin'. They killed our last boss in a smoking room. Toshokai is now… a smoke-free workplace. Hey. Get the body bags. Yes, sir. -The hole? -Over there. -Where? -There. I don't see it. That's it. It's too small. Is it? Guess a van wouldn't fit in it. You dug your own grave. Those are your graves. -I'm sorry. Please. -See? I don't wanna die. Look at that. Ain't it somethin'? Look here. Weather's bad here, isn't it? Rain, typhoons? -Right? -Yes, when it rains, it rains. You knew that and still did this? Maybe we should kill 'em. Can't trust 'em. No more than five a day. That's my rule. I killed one. Crushed one. Still have three today. What do you think? -We'll dig! -Three slots left, you know? We're sorry! Shut up. The jury's still out. We're deliberating! Okay, get in. Get in the hole! A commemorative photo. For what? I'm going to post this if you fuck up. -Get rid of the van. -Yes, sir! You're having fun. Smile. Say cheese. -I'm going to grab a bite. -Okay. Babe? It's from Tak Boy. Good timing, Emiri, hop on. Now? I was sleeping. If not now, then when? This call's about to change my life. Good news or bad, that phoenix on your back will comfort me. Okay. -Hey. -Storm's passed. -Any damage? -Three houses. Destroyed? Nothing left. Good. Go take a couple of days off. I'm back tomorrow. Fine. Good news? Yep. Now George is the only one left of the Expelled. Sing to me. KILLED KINA AND TWO OTHERS DETAILS TO FOLLOW -Ozu or Kurosawa? -Ozu. -Picasso or Van Gogh? -Picasso. Is that so? Mars or Jupiter? Mars. -Lawrence of Arabia or The Wild Bunch? -Lawrence. Lawrence? Really? I mean, it's not bad, but… Entered it wrong. No way. Let me try again. I'm not that stupid. What the hell? I did not enter the wrong number. Nas-teeth! Go get the door. Clean up! -Open the door! -Hurry up! Hey! Open up! -Go open the damn door. -Open it. You can hear us! Welcome back. Be glad it was one kick. Motherfuckers. -Nas-teeth. -Don't. -Stay outta this. -In a bad mood today? We return. The passcode's changed. We're locked out. -We risk our lives and this is our reward? -Calm down. You probably pushed wrong. You calling us stupid? No, I'm not. What's going on, Slick? -It's like MLB. -What? Major League Baseball. They dump a bucket of Gatorade on the guy who hit the walk-off grand slam. Meaning? It's your hero's welcome. -Then where's the-- -Don't. -Who do you think you are? -You little shit. We snuffed Kina, but George is alive. Maybe backed by a family in the west. -We know that. -Losing sight from your bookkeeping? Cut it out! Door's locked because of a damn prank. We could have been killed by the door, and the family mocked-- Enough, Muro. Since when are hit men so important? Just like when we met in Bangkok, Slick, you can't see danger. Tak! -Cut this out! -Enough already! Shut the fuck up! I was dozing off, feeling so relaxed. Then this noise? You know I love my barber time. That chair costs as much as a Lexus. -Sorry, sir. -Sorry, sir. You're saying "sorry" to a yakuza? What's wrong with you two? Your big brothers and uncles come out to welcome you home from the job. But you bark at them like a stray dog. Got a body like a tire. Perhaps it's time… Welcome back. Good job. Yell at me, too, Pops. Idiot. Clueless as ever. I can't go unpunished-- It's no fun punching you. Go donate some blood. Have Tak fist fuck you. Now let's go celebrate! Yes, sir! -The usual spot. -Hell yeah! Good evening. Welcome. -This way to your table. -All right. Not you. Go somewhere else. Okay. Hug each other. Tightly. A good one. Sit over there. Not there, Muro. Over there. At the end? Cheers. -Open your mouth! -Yes, ma'am. Wider! -"Va pensiero, sull'ali dorate." -Louder! Sit there. What's up, Bear? -Eatin' steak? -About to. It's a good place. Treat 'em well. I know. We won't embarrass you. And afterward? Maybe karaoke? Wanna join? I'm the secretary to the boss. Your men would freeze up. I guess. Sayo's opening a members-only club. S and M, right? Come over tonight-- a dress rehearsal. -Toki? -Hey, Sayo. I can get more girls. Really? Then maybe I should perform. This is a sweeter soy sauce, pairs well with wasabi. It's good. Welcome. How do you like your meat? He likes it very rare. I had a four-ounce poop. So, another four-ounce steak. Very well. Six months without food? A human experiment by Veda. My brain says I'm full. "I'm hungry" is your mantra. It makes me human. You? Human moments? About four, five times a day. -Pops. -What? I'm done for tonight. What about the S and M show? There'll be girls. Massage over sex. I'm so stiff. Stick that stiff in a girl, move it around. -I'll get a cab. -I'll get it myself. -Okay. -Good night. Thank you, Pops. O-Zez? Is that you? A four-ounce poop? Still the same. You could've said hi. Surrounded by all those yakuza? No. They make you do clean up? I thought you'd be back. -You did? -I did. Hi, Tak. Long time no see. -Ms. N available? -No, but I'll get you in. Your Japanese improved. It was never not good. -Thank you. -You're welcome. I can't do next week. -Next week… -Can we do the week after? Week after? Let's see. Then, how about this time? I am crossing a bridge now. I don't know what bridge it is. I think I'll give it a name. -You came out of Veda normal. -So are the others. Folks on death row, Z? -Don't call me Z. -Why? -I have a name. -O-Zez. -You forgot my name? -Who cares? Hello. -Boyfriend? -Yep! -He's not. -I'm Muro. -He's not. -I'm Nobana. -Huh? -Nobana. He's not. -What would you like? -Two coffees. -That's my seat. -Here? Yeah, switch. -Your seat? -It's my seat. Delts, glutes, legs, all stiff on the right. Most yakuza damage their liver. -Is it bad? -Really bad. Where'd you get your sixth sense? Half the masseuses have it. Bad energy crawls up our arms. Disease and demons. Yours is a demon. I need to rest five minutes for every ten. Otherwise, it'll get me too. O-Zez? It's Anna. Kids with a past, reunited. Let's hook up. Not with a yakuza. You blew me when I was a little wiener. -I did not! -You did. Stop it. -You went to town! -I did not! -All over it! -Over what? Wanna know? Sit down. No, don't. Coffee? -Ouch! -It's nothing. She was all over me. You know what that means-- -Who cares? We were young. -Hey, shut up. New password. "0402bowling." Why do you swallow it? Just rip it up and toss it. How did you end up an agent? Like I said, I can't tell you. -You know my story. -Yes. You gotta give me something. Hands up. You make home visits to Chuji? Yep. Once a week. He has 'em too? Of course he does. But… not as bad as yours. Did Chief order you to go? Oh, no. I've known him much longer. -Before he lost his nose? -Yes. I'm living by the code of the survivor. Just like you. Toshokai killed my son. Here. Upstairs. Wow. This is it. It's kinda like the Veda days. Kitchen for a large family. You even have a pyramid. Wounds heal faster in there. -Like our parents said? -We're not them. Scary. I have three other hideouts like this. Why? If I'm hurt, I want a pyramid wherever I need to hide. I don't get it. You make a lot of money. I have enough. No one knows about this place. No one's been here. It's the cleanest place I got. And it's my favorite. -Why do you have a shrine in here? -Cool, right? -Pops? -Where you at? At my massage. Can you be here in 30 minutes? Yes. The party's over? Got some curious intel. Come over. You look worried. He never asks me to come this late. As if he's considerate. It's happened once before. And it wasn't good. He asked me about killing an undercover-- a narc. A narcotics agent? He was in charge of trafficking drugs for Slick. A devil's job-- made mules swallow condoms full of drugs. He looked evil. I had no idea he was a narc. Chief told me. Toshokai works with a big IT company on facial recognition. The authorities have been stripped naked. They're vulnerable, including their families. Did you kill the narc? I asked to do it. I had to. Slick's men carried it out. I think I was tested. You'll be fine. You won't be exposed. I'm 99.99% certain. That's not 100%. There's always a hole with humans involved. -Fuckin' George surfaced in LA. -With who? Yusuf Abu Khalil. Lebanese American broker. -Deals anything from sex to hit men. -These pics? Taken by a person in my network. Been missing ever since. He was dead at home. Job of a pro. -Tantalizing. -Right? -What's my job? -Bodyguard. -For you? -Further up. -You mean-- -Yep. He has his team. -You and Muro are our family's best. -True. Too much for you? We're not business-minded. It's fighting we're good at. I can't believe you! Felt good, right? Did you have to pull out? But it felt good, didn't it? Did you cum inside? Nope. I shoot blanks. No sperm. -Always? -Yeah. Since forever. You'll make a good bum. A good bum? ASSIGNMENT FROM POPS BODYGUARD FOR MR. X USUAL PARTNER Did you pick the lock? It was easy. My dad's a locksmith. We shouldn't do this. Do this? Like this? I told you. I'm free after 3 a.m. Pops may be asleep, but the others… Don't worry. I'm careful. It's dangerous. Don't be cold. I might tell. Sex on a tightrope. I love it. -Mornin', ma'am. -Mornin', ma'am. -I'll carry it. -What's your name? -Fall. -Since when? Since I was born. And they're Spring and Summer? That's right. You can go, Mole. How are you feeling? My back is sore. -Let's have a look. -Yes. I can never get used to him. To who? Mole. He's my shadow. He watches my health. Watches your health? He analyzes my bowl every morning. -The bowl? -My poop. Go, go! -Go spar, Bear. -Too old. Good, good! Take that! Behind you. -All right! -Take a break! Chuji, this is Tak from our family. You've met him before. Hello, sir. And this kid? Muro. You forget already? Muro… Muro. Your parents were on death row. Smooth skin, college boy. Go easy on him. I want them to do security. That's no good. I want my Beasts to do it. Your Beasts? Mine are Hell Dogs. Let 'em fight. The winner gets the job. -My guys can leave. And clean up. -Yes, sir! Clean up! Selection complete. -Now lift. -Yes, sir. Teru, Baz, put a vest on those two. Put it on, get in the ring. Stand in a line facing me. You're Team Japan. You're listening to the national anthem. Hum along if you like. Pray! Start on the whistle. Now fight! You were shot shielding me. The shooting continues. Get off the floor! Fight. -Fight! -Muro. Get up. Fight. Fight! Hey, Muro. I said fight! Muro! Not me, not me. Get 'em! Good, good! I give up! How did you get up? Ouch! Key card to the penthouse and your ID. Easy days are over. Get ready. Please handle us with care. It's all out of love, Muro. Ouch! Meeting upstairs after you're done. There's more to this job than being a shield. My jewels. Balls one and two. Ladies? Boss's office is around the back. You stand by here. Sign these papers. You're centurions. There are tons of rules. -Centu-- -Roman captains. Roman…? Always carry bulletproof vests and briefcases. You are his shield. Car doors are… reinforced. No accessories that look yakuza. No gaudy ties. Unplanned funerals happen. Wear dark suits, carry prayer beads. Report anything suspicious by radio, however small. Use private SMS with Mr. Bear. Keep him updated. Be careful driving. Cops will try to bust you for anything. Wear your seat belt. Headset at all times. No heavy drinking that cause hangovers. President despises body odor. We have spare shirts here. Basically, two days on, two days off. -So, there's another team? -Right. We didn't beat the A-Team? Nope. They're still on detail. -Can we meet them? -No. -So, no shared info between teams? -None. Per the boss. We're the subs so the A-Team gets their rest. A-Team members can tell the type of gun you're carrying, just by how you move. Scary. Not the type. Oh, but they can. Let's go. We have Neo-Episteme today. At 5 p.m., with Mr. Dawson of the International Evangelical Alliance. What's illicit business for yakuza? GIRL STRANGLED MAN SENTENCED TO LIFE Seven-year old girl kidnapped, raped, killed and dismembered. No premeditation, so the court spared the man's life. "Death penalty not inevitable." Tenth case a jury's recommendation has been rejected. -Tak. -Sir? Any thoughts? Does yakuza's illicit business… include fighting for justice? Who do you judge? The killer, for sure. I'd judge the judge who said it was "not inevitable." Totally agree. Shut up, Muro. Good team. It was a good game. It was. I'm excited for a change. You might save me from boredom. I hope you do. -Prayer beads. -Prayer beads. Prayer beads. You're hogging the water supply up north, Ms. Chao. Toake is disciplined like a businessman. Except he meets people who have bodyguards. There's always pat downs. He enjoys museums. He has four cars. Not a single Tokyo plate. Ten of his men live at his house. Our day ends at his front door. Always tips us 40,000 to 50,000 yen. The ritual yesterday was strange. This place was going to be a restaurant. Chinese? Our old boss was building a resort for yakuza where he'd retire. A prayer spa. "The woodland lake of Aricia. Diana's Mirror." Bear, let's pray. Sì, Capo. Mythology Hall. Corpus Mythorum. I'll kill George, then finish this project. -Is he gay? -Don't know. -Old boss's lover. -Just worshipped him. No woman? His chauffeur told me… No women allowed in here. -He got no women? -No one regular. -Dudes? -He's not gay. You sure? Have you noticed the way he looks at Tak? See? He wants you. Please-- Sounds like you can get intel from the driver. Don't. He wants you to bite. Toake's having him talk? He's careful-- it's a test. Don't ask questions. Muro was asking the questions. He can ask. You just listen. What's the emergency? Celebrating a promotion? See ya. Stay. We'll go to the roof. Why are you so mopey? I'll come later. You gotta meet everyone. -I don't know… -Don't worry, they're cool. We're almost there. Here we are. -There's so many people. -You're fine. Hey, it's Anna! Hey! -Your boyfriend? -Who's this? This is Hideki Murooka. I'm Kyoko. Nice to meet you. Muro, remember me? -Hey! Nobana, right? -That's right. Toake has the police by the balls. How so? Incriminating files on higher-ups. Toake's computer. -Steal it. -It's fingerprint ID. "Gummy finger." It's got his index finger printed on it. Tested 100 times on an identical box. 97% success. -And the scandal? -Can't say it. It's classified. How did you get the print? There's a file on Toshokai. He has no criminal record and he always wears gloves. We had chances. I'm done as an undercover if I do this. I'll lose my income. You have 24 hours after he dies. 50% chance I'm there if he's attacked. More likely I'll die first. Protect yourself, let him die. Easy for you to say. -Ready? -Do it. Revolution! -No way. -Bummer! Success. Last one! I'm out. Last one. What group is this? -What do you think? -Guess. -You're a choir. -A choir! No? Knew it. You're behind George's actions. No comment. I'm a bodyguard. I'm going to kill anyone who comes after Toake. To an extent. Double my risk benefit. Copy that. Twelve members of the same jury. Close! Right idea. -Right idea? -But wrong. But I'm wrong. It's Tak who killed the narc. I know. If I'm exposed and they tell him to kill me, would he? I need a massage. A massage. He's a fiend about money. We pay him and he withdraws it right away. What for? Why not look into it? No manpower. It's not critical. He does his job. He's liked. Saving for retirement? There won't be one. Tak is living in medieval times. In that he's free of the law. He wants a transfigured life. He's ready to die for beauty, like in the old days. Same as Toshokai. No, it's not. Toshokai is a bond of men. His is for all genders. My arms can feel it when I work on his body. Who's been called a murderer's kid? For real? Who's related to a victim? Wait, what? A convict can be helped, but their family gets no help. Always apologizing… We want to help others in our life. It's not hypocrisy, and I've wanted a like-minded group. We've been through so much that we understand pain deeply. -So true. -Well said. Jaco was on a documentary on TV. I didn't want to be like my parents. I laid myself open on TV. Talked about creating space for people like us. Then, Anna and Duck called. -Me too. -You were later. -Yep. -I was? Then, we connected with the Victims Families Group. You'll fall low if you're not needed by someone. What? Stop, guys. No, I didn't mean to-- So hot! Yours? Want a good time? My God, you're so cute. Drink with me. Nari, look, look! Isn't that Tak? Next time. Bye. POLICE 2ND STREET, SHINJUKU Something's strange. Like what? Six months ago, I got an envelope full of cash. Inside it was 200K and a note saying, "The killers have paid." From who? Only said "G.I." Foreigner? -Bogus address. -And then? Every two months, I get another 200,000 yen. -What? -200,000 yen? -Any notes? -Not since the first. Your mom died 12, 13 years ago? Eleven. I know the date. July 30th, 9:40 p.m. Three men robbed a supermarket-- -No details! -I know, no details. They killed my mom and three high school girls. My dad killed himself. I went to the victims' families about the money. -To Mr. Mamiya? -Yes. One of the girls was his. They all got the same cash and note. Did they know who G.I. was? Mr. Mamiya remembered a cop from the 2nd Street station. Goro Idezuki. Initials are "G.I." A cop avenged them? And he's also a benefactor? No way. X-factor benefactor? Stop with the dad joke. -Okay, okay, hear me out. -Listen, guys. Suppose I was that cop. It was on my turf. Maybe I saw the men earlier. Like, "What if I'd stopped them?" -Gotta atone. -Exactly. So, he spends a decade hunting them? -Eleven years. -No way. It's possible. But, listen! How dope if it were true, right? "If." I'm saying if it were true. -He's murdering. -That's badass. Who cares? They killed, too. What a fun night. Idezuki! Hey, Goro! Goro! Here he is. Call me? Oh. No! Don't do that! -Goro? -Where? Careful. Careful. Wait, wait. What's going on? -Here he is! -Don't use my real name! Goro's right here! Careful. Stand back, please. Hey, I'm Johnny! I bet you're right. The cop on 2nd Street. Spent years hunting the bad guys and made them pay. An ideal life. The hell it is! Stop living like this! Get out and live with me. I like the way it is now. A place in Sydney wants me. I'm flying out tomorrow. Piece-of-shit alarm! You could have woken me up. You're great sleeping. Great sleeping? What's that supposed to mean? Cute? Pretty? Sorry. I brought some intel. Gotta go. I found out what Yusuf got for George. A top mercenary. Oliver Hendrickson. He's in Japan, with the Hanaokas. -Nagoya or Kobe? -Pops will call you first thing. Out of time. Bye. Tak Boy. -You're here. -Debriefing. -The fuck? -Sorry. Ears aren't for licking or chewing. You're right. So right. Hendrickson in Nagoya means George is teamed up with them. -Do you follow? -Yes, sir. The Hanaokas may be the largest family, but they're a mess. The boss is in Nagoya, but HQ is still in Kobe. The boss tried to move HQ to Nagoya, but gave up after Kobe raised hell. Opposition was led by Tawaraya, head of the Kobe family. So, the boss set up a system to squeeze the Kobe faction. Forces them to buy water, soap, TP and more sold by the Nagoya faction. Both are full of resentment. Our boss invited Tawaraya up to deepen the wedge. Isn't Tawaraya a prison buddy of Uncle Bear? Been tight for 20 years, but I don't like him. He flip-flops, he's a chameleon. The boss and Bear need to be more careful. What's my job? -If he acts oddly, kill him. -We can't carry a gun. -There's no pat down today. -Still… WILD WEST FAMILY FEUD I said, "It doesn't feel right." And they cut me out. Think of it as standing in for me. Please. -Ready? -Yes, sir. We're ready. Ho capito, due minuti. -What's that? -Bear thinks he's Italian. You ran into Tak outside a club? Yeah, Nas-teeth saw him. He was like "Look, look!" Welcome. Sorry for the trouble. No trouble at all. Anything for you, sir. Kobe requested you. -They seemed pleased on the last visit. -Welcome. They're waiting. It's been a while. -Him? -My secretary, Buzz. A pleasure, sir. Brother! My security. Tak, a capo in the Kozu family, and Muro. -So you're the guys… I see. -I'm Muro. -I'm Tak. -Heard a lot about you. Strong faces. Thank you. Is your family siding with George again? You mean Oliver in Nagoya? Sorry for the nuisance. It's just a family matter. Am I interfering? Oh, no. We just don't have time to pick fights. That foreigner's a pain for us. There are rumors… Oliver's training Nagoya men… …to send us a message. "We'll destroy you"… Recruiting foreigners… …how to shoot, use knives. They're tryin' to intimidate us any way they can. I didn't invite you here for rumors. Sorry. Nagoya's got their guard up. I'll pay for it all. Plant a bug, get transmitters-- I need reliable intel. I know Oliver is connected to George. Share our urgency, will you? Mr. Toake, you know it's impossible. We'd be traitors. So be it. It's time you make up your mind anyway. Make up our-- What's Hanaoka without Kobe? Supposing the family breaks up, Nagoya will set its target on you, no doubt. So I'll kill George, then take Nagoya. It's what I live for. The boss shared his honest thoughts. Now it's your turn. Our guests are sweating. Crank the AC. Yes, sir. How did we become so slavish? Always reacting, never acting. Buzz? You said you'd pay for it all. Three hundred million yen, already laundered. Use it for information. Please. Don't bow to us, sir, please. Buzz! He's good. -He's very good. -Amazing. -I love being tied up. -Yeah? Like that? Try it. Ouch! What else do you like? Buzz, sit down. Stop singing. You new here? I can't take anymore. Make him stop. I only started a week ago. Luca's new to the business. Scold her for me if she needs it. -Sorry. -What did you do before? An office job at a parts supplier. Full-time? Yes, but the car companies started-- Got it. Back me up. "Ring the bell"? I oughta ring your bell! Outta my way. Changing singers. I'll take another. Thanks. -Luca, another one, please. -Yes. You wanna sing again? -Sir? -Take a sip. Was I inappropriate? Surprise test. Taste it. See if you got it right. It's made for the boss. We can't-- Drink it. Had too many, Tak? I'm sober. Sorry. I'll make-- Take a fuckin' sip! Tak? What's going on? Leave the girls alone. Hey, Tak. Luca, go to the others. Don't. What's up, Tak? She has calluses on her right hand. Years of gripping a knife, but she's not a chef. New girl, you have permission. Take a sip. Learn on the job. Careful! Cover your face! -Get back! -Turn up the music. Keep her in. Louder, louder! Stop! A newcomer? Are you a part of this? Absolutely not! No one in Ginza can offend the boss! -I'd lose my business! -Slick, we need processing. Ladies, please don't worry. You're safe. I've never seen a hit woman. I'm so sorry. After all your trouble. Sounds funny, but I learned a lot. We need to rethink security. Totally. Yes. You have some good men under you. Please stand up, ma'am. Forgive me! It's our fault. We were out despite being targeted. You're a victim. Mr. Toake. We had fun, drinking and singing. Yes, sir. There was never a girl named Luca here. Outside is clear. Take our guests back. Yes, sir. And you? I'll stay out. See them out, ladies. -Don't look so serious, you hear? -Yes, ma'am. -Louder. -Yes, ma'am. -Can't hear you! -Yes, ma'am! Buck up, Chisa. Ready? We'll do the processing. Sure. But I'm going with you. That won't do. The brothers would kill me. I'm in great spirits. Both at once. -You got it? -I can carry 'em. This is fine. See ya. -Good night. -Thanks. Why did you call Slick? His entourage will come. I said come alone. Stop there. How are ya? Evening, sir. Muro, Tak, be on the lookout. Copy that. Monitors this way. You're here, too? -I was-- -Here, Slick! Pops, Sis, Uncle, what's going on? Just get in. I planted a bug with the cash. -Boss's order? -Our own decision. Tawaraya's on our side. The boss thinks so, but not us. -Uncle Bear? -Unsure. He agreed to the bug. George sent Hendrickson. They knew the boss would call Tawaraya if he found out. Tawaraya chose the meeting place. As always. Right. But, then, the hit woman… -George scripted this? -Naturally. Could he? He's half insane. He got a strategist. Either way, Tawaraya was not expecting 300 million yen. He'll go to George. Or else Nagoya would think he's a traitor. It'd be war. Sing. Sing. Watchdog? Some coffee. -Yes, Boss. -Sing. Come on, sing, will ya? -Let her down, Bear. -You sure? Yes, I'm bored. The heart of Toshokai's darkness. All contraband comes through here: drugs, knockoffs, black market animals-- everything. We killed some of the Expelled here during the feud five years ago. I smell chemicals. Gotta clean in the summer. Blood seeps in the floor. Brings maggots. Who cleans it? Our cleanup contractors. They're messy. They're thorough. They use chemicals that beat blue light. They deodorize with ozone. We'll call them tomorrow. It's easy to break a girl's fingers. Takes time and effort to break her spirit. What about her uniform? There's a beautiful girl. I bought the uniform. It cost a fortune. And then? Then? Nothing. -Why didn't you use it? -What? Your ankle gun. It was for Tawaraya, just in case. -Pop's order? -Couldn't let Tawaraya see it. Makes sense. Okay, I'm going to break that bitch's spirit now. Suppose George was smart-- -Shut up. -Huh? Just let him speak. Would it end after the first wave? I'll tell you before you snap. Tell us everything and you live. Say nothing? We hurt you more, till this hot thug gouges your eye with a screwdriver. I'll strum your optic nerves, Luca. It would be la musica of such sorrow. So true! -Hey, Muro? -Yeah? Sound of a four-ounce poop. Go! Poop? What did you think? -Wasn't it good? -Your grunt. It's a big poop. You do it. Here ya go. -Huge, 5.5 ounces. -Nine ounces. Nine ounces! Mine was bigger. Mr. Bear has the biggest. He's sick! Sick, huge turd! The boss went home. Did you check? What if he went with them? What's your point? Bear wouldn't be followed. I'd have the bitch swallow a tracker. -The boss isn't home. I can't reach Bear. -Ready? Go, go. Huh? Boss? What's up? Hold on. A tracker? They set us up. Watchdog, the electrical panel! I don't know where-- -Are there guns there? -Just bats and clubs. -Pops? -You with the boss? Yes. What is he thinking? It's about to get busy. Gotta go. Go to processing. -I'll need guns, it'd take a few hours-- -No need. It'll be over by then. Just a stack of bodies. Take the cleaners. I have to clean up? -Get in the car! -All right. I'll navigate. A-Team, get here. ASAP. -Boss! To the office! -Go! -Guns! -Ain't none here. Wait, there may be one. -Hurry, hurry! -There might be something! -Chauffeur! -I'll look for it! Uncle Bear! I'll hold them here. Watchdog, Watchdog. I found a gun. The hell? A Manville. Really loud. Ineffective. Cops used it on a union strike in '35. Old boss got it. -It's got cobwebs. -It was oiled. -Will it fire? -If this turns… Give it to me. -I'll get rounds. -Got it. One pound… Two pounds… Nine enemies. They've split. They're going up. Tak, go take 'em out. -But… -We got it here. Go help Bear. Go. -Take it. -Thanks. Give it. -Put up a wall. -Yes, sir. Uncle Bear! Watch out! -You're blocking my shot. -Sorry. They're moving. -Follow us. -Yes, sir! Grunt. Like you're pooping. Grunt for me. Now? Now's the moment. Now or never. Luca… One more. Is the boss… safe? Hello? The chauffeur? Bear. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Should we hug, too? No. Okay, stop, stop. Hurry! Start cleaning. Take pics. We have another stop. Quickly. A-Team took the boss home. I know. Pops wants you. -Got a car? -Follow me. See how we look? Shouldn't speed too much. Cops? Just shoot 'em. You know, I've never shot a cop. -Really? -I don't want to, either. Respect. A yakuza respecting cops? I heard a heartwarming story. What story? A supermarket was robbed 11 years ago. A staff lady and three teenagers were killed. I remember. It was awful. Crazy Chinese mafia. I met the lady's daughter. For six months, she's been getting an envelope of cash with a note: "The killer has paid." Signed only "G.I." So, where's the cop? There was a cop stationed nearby: Goro Idezuki. Initials are "G.I." Right. Dope story if it's him. Hunts the killers for 11 years and pays the victims. So badass. -Did the attacks work? -They didn't. He has fierce security. -We got your buddy. -Bear's dead? Is this the 300-million-yen gift? I don't understand Toake. Gotta figure out our next step. -Right. -Park the car. You said hit man. I didn't expect a girl. But I expected your song. -Which one? -Don't you know? -Where's Pops? -He left. Got impatient. -When? -Five minutes ago, Emiri? Or so. You hurt? -Not my blood. -There'll be more. -Wait for cleanup. -Copy. -Nas-teeth, lead. -I'll lead. -I'll lead-- -Nas-teeth? Which way? Yes, there. -Where? -Go straight. Nas-teeth? He's gone. He was right behind us. Get him! Who the fuck are you? What the hell is this? Big bro! Fuckers! Ouch! Found you! Big bro! Move! Out of my way. Just like you thought, Pops. We'll bury Bear in secret. -You get me? -No, sir. Bear will go AWOL and Toshokai will disown him. He sets off to the next world in dishonor. He has no savings. Never paid attention to money. Never had kids so he could die without regrets. What about his wife? The 300 million we got back. This goes to her. -Just the tables for now. No chairs yet. -Bring the chairs here. Space the bowls equally. -Mr. Slick? -Yeah? That story… 'bout Tak and the police box. In Shinjuku? -I thought Goro was the trans. -What? The cop was shouting-- -He was calling Mr. Tak, "Goro." -Goro? "Hey! Goro Idezuki!" From Muro's story. The "G.I." cop. Did you know Mr. Tak was a cop? -Did you tell others? -No, sir. -Don't tell anyone. -I won't. -Go back to work. -Back to work. -Goodbye. -You have to wait. Bear's capo, Monma, will start a new family. Koharu? -Koharu? -Yes? -Go help with the arrivals. -Yes, ma'am. -Are you free? -Yes. -Move. -Sorry, sir. Hang in there. It's hard. Koharu? Over there? Gotta change! Over here, I brought it. -Hurry. -Yes, sir! Thank you for accommodating us. I used to be a yakuza too. Lunch is from my husband's restaurant. Prepared with care just as Bear liked. I hope you enjoy it. You okay? It's totally gone-- my appetite. Boss, who'll be secretary? I wanted Toki as an interim, but he refused. Then, Slick? I still have a lot to learn-- -Tak will do it. -Toki and I agreed. From the boss. Boss? -Ready, sir? -Anytime. Tak, it's your first job as secretary. Come. Are Tak and I…? You're no longer a team. Pops! Shut up and watch. Bear died because you put yourself in danger. Do you realize what you did? I do. The boss never goes to a torture site. I'll go check. I deserve it. I need to make it right with Bear. Give me another. Pops! Shut up. Stay back! Don't interfere. Don't. Cutting off a finger's so passé. It's the price I pay for hitting you. Don't. Tak, step on it for me. I got hard bones. I'm your boss. Stop! -Step on it, now. -Stop it! -How dare-- -Quiet, Slick! Toki hit the boss. He deserves it. Now it's over. Got it? Listen to me. Toki gave me a chance to make it right. He took the risk. I'm grateful. Carry him out. Toki's stubborn. He'll try again. I know. I'll hide anything he'd try to use. The funeral's not over. Let's sing Bear's favorite song together. You should be cuttin' off your finger. You took the boss to fuckin' processing. I'm sorry. They may forgive you, but I won't, you fuck. I'll rip you a new one, stuff it with leftovers. A finger like this? You can have it anytime. But how is it that a Kozu capo lets a guy get behind him so easily? Kinda embarrassing. Fuck you, you low-life psychopath. Stop, Muro. Let's go. I'm going to take a piss first. What the…? You fuck! I'm risking everything to advise you. Just like Pops showed us. Calm down. "Son of death row inmates"? I never said that. It's our work that lets you make money without fear. Goin' too far? Nope, not at all. Who cares? Wait, Muro, wait! I need your help. It's no time for us to fight. This must be what it's like when a killer snaps. Your hero, Goro, the cop. What about it? It might be Tak! Impossible. It's true, ask Nas-teeth. We just need proof. Get a better excuse to save your life. He may be an undercover. We need to protect Toshokai. We got along before Tak. Remember? Sad. I low-key snapped. I wish I could blame it on drugs. I saw my parents. Slick looks just like my dad. Run. Run. Are you undercover? No, right? No, I'm not. I don't like that "no." I'm… a Hell Dog. The same as you. I've had nightmares all my life. But you and I… It could have been good. I'll send you to hell with Slick! -Where is Muro? -No idea. There's no way he hasn't called you. -Your phone? -Hold on. What? Think you'll get away with this? Of course. Tak! Hunt for Muro as you like, but leave me alone. Gotcha. -Language. -Yes, sir. -Can't hear. -Yes, sir! -Let me out. -Yes, sir. My head! You're very bold. Change of plans. What was with Hendrickson? An FBI decoy. Went home. The real Hendrickson died two years ago in Syria-- You can't just stroll into my place like this. One more hit. After that, you're free. Go on vacation, retire. We'll pay for it all. I won't retire. I swore to protect my families till I die. -Families? -Four families. Atoning for Goro Idezuki. Kill the boss and steal the secret file? Toake's real name is So Koreyasu. We trained him with the FBI. He was undercover in Toshokai. The files are his email and call records with us. Dumbasses. He was to split up Toshokai and cut off cash flow to far-right pols in the US. Illegal casinos? International Evangelical Alliance. "Neo-Episteme." Heard of them? He sees them a lot. The Tokyo branch has diplomatic immunity. They built a casino. Toake used his ins to raise his business reputation abroad. It's your mistake. You handle it. Then, I'll kill you. Tak Boy's undercover, too? You're lovers? You scared me! You scared me. You could have told me. Would you like milk in it? Hey, remember me? Of course. What happened? Nothing. Is Anna back from Sydney? She'll be back soon. I think this is Goro, "G.I." Can you ask Mr. Mamiya? I'll wait. Can you? Ain't got time. Here. Poachers like elephants with big tusks. Large adult males are killed first-- the ones that can mate. Then they kill the matriarch, the leader of the herd. They can't survive without her. Elephants will go extinct unless poaching ends. You've been there. I was on an anti-poaching task force in Tanzania. Fresh out of vet school. Japanese vet. Kid of a yakuza. Japan says it's not involved in ivory trafficking. Fucking liars. You know I work for the government. I'm going to end the yakuza's ivory business. Kill all three at once. I'll kill Toki. -Alone? -Of course. And Chuji? Someone who's waited eight years. The wait is over. -Morning. -Good morning. -Mornin', ma'am. -Mornin'. Babe? You should be in bed. Your fever will go up. A bit early, but wanna do up? Muro killed Slick. Yes. Who's on it? The boss said to wait and see. Why don't you make Tak do it? He's secretary to the boss. I can't make him! You're lovers. I've known it a while. Tak's important. That's why you're alive. Fuckin' bitch! You gotta be kiddin'. Neo-Episteme today? Yes, at 7 p.m. Mr. Dawson of International Evangelical Alliance. Perfect. I'll introduce you. -Have you found Muro? -Not yet. -He'll contact you. -If he does, I'll-- Don't. I want him to escape overseas. Slick was a problem anyway. Thank you. You and I… together to the grave. Why was my son killed? He touched my granddaughter. I thought she came on to him. Maybe. Same, either way. Little thug didn't know his place. I never said kill him. My men inferred it. An accident. Inferred to stab him over and over again? What's your point? The thing is, I can hear my son's screams even now. Crawling up these arms. I paid you for your loss. Yes, you did. Ms. N, you done already? He's tired today. Let him sleep an hour. Yes, ma'am. Don't got it. But he's got one already. Is it worth the 30,000 yen? Good point. Ms. N! My shoulders are sore. Your boss's warmth is still in my hands. Do you dare? Fine. Wait, where's your bag? Didn't want to wake him. I'll get it later. Okay. Okay. Five minutes, that's it. Yes! Just be back by evening. Enjoy a fancy lunch. Thank you, sir. You're respectful. You're secretary to the boss. -Pat down by sight? -No problem. He was an LAPD spotter. You see where a gun is carried? More by the gait. -How about the type? -80% of the time. -What's mine? -Not on you. I'm disappointed. Why? You and I… could have been friends. I have a gun… hidden, you see? This is a surprise. I came to apologize to Pops, and this? Vengeance is mine. Don't take it wrong. This is just a kiss. The kiss of death. Tak will never forgive you. He was a cop-- tactical unit. He's my man. Why? You want to know why? Yes. The long or short version? Long one. Eleven years ago, I was a rookie cop in Shinjuku-- on 2nd Street. Please run a check on registration number… Sarge? That guy has a gun. How the hell do you know? A Tokarev. No conjectures, rookie. I'm gun-spotting. Can you say he's 100% carrying a Tokarev-- Hey, it's all you can drink! You can't. Gotta use all your senses, not just your eyes. Yes, sir. Two hours later, they robbed the supermarket. Four killed by a Tokarev. You called? I want to share my secret. I was an undercover. When the cops came down on Toshokai, I came out to the Kozu Trio. Told them we can outsmart the cops and the FBI. Heart is won by heart. They instantly decided to anoint me leader. It's a kind of bond lacking in the deceitful authorities. Warm-blooded brothers over an icy government. Exactly. Now, you've chosen me. -Why? -To see who you really are. Anai would surely send in a man worse than me. You knew. When? Just now. As we were talking. But I've always wondered. Just like a young girl with a flower. He loves me… he loves me not. Loves me… loves me not. The A-Team's gone? Don't be a dog. Free yourself. We could take over the world together. Deep is the darkness. I think I'm a mad dog. I only know how to bite. It seems I was born that way. -Besides… -Besides? I like elephants. -Why not my head? -Why not mine? Where's Ms. N? FINISHED. I'M OUT. -N. Nothing from Emiri. Sent a man and found Toki dead. I'll go there now. You? I'll pray. Stuffin' myself to death! See ya soon. I'm at the House of Bamboo. Got a special guest here. Hurry up, okay? Video for Tak. Say something, leave a message. Come soon, or you might regret it. A murdered God. What do you want, brother? That word means a lot. What do you want, Muro? Three questions. Please answer honestly. Sure. Are you an undercover agent, Goro? Yes. Who cares? -Let's go back to the family. -It's gone. Leaders are dead. So, what was I to Goro? -You asking? -Not really. You were the King of the Wood. "A priest seeks to kill a man. Having killed him, he is soon killed himself." I don't get it, but it sounds dope. I got this far because… you were with me. Last question. -Can I avenge Pops? -It's over, Muro. Last question. That was your last. Which will it be? Me or this bitch? Started with Mad Dog, ends with Hell Dog. -We do the kiss of death. -Right? Am I right? -Should we? -Right? Do the kiss of death. -Right on the mouth. -He won't give up. Hey, you. What the hell ya doin'? We closed an hour ago. You Japanese? You're making us look bad. Look at this guy. Hold on! Let's calm down and eat our yummy dinner. Hey, stop. This guy's legit. This is wicked fun! -Havin' fun? -Lotta fun. Lotta fun.
