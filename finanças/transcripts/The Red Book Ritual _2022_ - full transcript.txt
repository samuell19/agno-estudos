The rules of the game are these. One, go into a quiet room. Two, place a candle in the middle. Light it. Use a book with a red cover and without illustrations. Three, ask for permission to enter the game and never quit the game without requesting it from the book. We're gonna need a book with a red cover. I have one in my room. Are you sure your parents aren't coming? Yeah, I'm sure. My Daddy's working all night and my brother won't wake up even if there's fireworks over his head. And your mom? It's just my dad, my younger brother and me. My mom passed away. Oh, I'm sorry. What happened? A few months ago she had an accident on her way to work. She was a doctor. I'm sorry. Well, let's continue. Bring the book. Let's freak her out. You're so evil. Oh, I love you baby. Thank you. Bea! I had a nightmare. There was a horrible woman. She is such a free. Now that is one creepy ass book. It was already here when we moved in. It's perfect. Is that your cat? No, it was already in the house too. It must have belong to the woman who was living here before. Mmmh, it must be the witch's cat. Yeah. What witch? Don't you know the story of this house? About the creepy old lady who used to live here. The whole town says she was a witch. She did satanic rituals on animals and then one day she disappeared. And that's her cat. People say that cat it's actually a demon that possesses its owners. Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie, Bonnie, hey, hey. What happened? Are you okay? Hey. I'm home. Where did you come from? Bonnie, what happened here? Bonnie? Bonnie. Let's cover, cover you up. Bonnie, what are you doing? Bonnie! You can't be out here like this, Bonnie. Argus? I missed you, Argus. Come on. Argus, come on. Come on, let's go. Don't judge me. You'll enjoy this. Picked it up on the way to Libya. I thought Bonnie would love this. That was a year ago. Alright, buddy. You've had enough. Argus, no, no. I'm sorry. It was Argus. It happened so fast. Bonnie no. You're making fun of me. Yeah, I'm sorry Bea but you see in your face though. You were freaking out, it was amazing. I don't know if it's true, a friend told me that story. But the disappearance of the old woman who used to live here, that's true. Anyway, let's get back to rules. Four, close your eyes, place the palm of your hand on the books cover and ask the following question. Red book, may I enter your game? "The sky suddenly turned dark." That's not a yes! It makes no sense. But it's pretty is scary. Oh, come on Sophie, this game is a scam. Are you frightened, babe? Are you frightened babe? He's right, we better leave it. Let's try again. Red book, may I enter your game? "She opened door, and let in the shadows of the past." Is that a yes? Did you hear that? Ahh, no. I don't wanna play this. Let's watch a movie. Is there anyone with us? "She was not alone. The shadows of the past were always with her." This is awesome! Okay, let me try. It's getting pretty good. Okay. How old am I? "They met October the 17th at the Counts mansion." That makes no sense. Wait, the people who play this game argue that the answers aren't always literal. Listen, October is month 10. So? And it says the 17th. 10 plus 17 is 27. Holy shit, it guessed it. It did. You're fucking with me again. I swear to you Bea, this is not a joke. Your turn. If you don't believe us, ask for proof. If you're really here with us, prove it. But that's not a question though, will it work? "She screams loudly, but no one can hear her." What does it mean by that? That scream came from inside the house. No, it truly came from the street. It just wants to scare us guys. Do you realize that she's in the house with us? I don't wanna play anymore. We can't quit the game without asking permission from the book. Maybe we should ask permission from the book. Red book, how can we leave the game? Sophie, that's not funny. Sophie stop joking, that's enough. Sophie stop that. Sophie... What the fuck was that? Okay, we gotta go. We gotta get the fuck outta here right now, right now. It's helping us, didn't you see? What? No I'm done with this shit. I just wanna get outta here. If we leave the game, we'll be in real danger. That's what it said. How many spirits are with us? Three. Red book, how can we get out of the game? "Read me." What? What does it mean? It's a story. I'll start. "She was sitting in the car feeling pain and sadness." Sorry. And this two, please. Here. Does it hurt? Got you water too. If you wanna take whatever they gave you- Can you just take me home? Yeah, of course. Hey, we'll try again, okay. Over there is nothing that you could have done. Hey, come on, talk to me. Do you think that this is easy? No, of course. It was a part of you too, Nick. - I know. - Yeah. Well, it doesn't seem that way. Not this time, not last time. What do you want me to say? I don't want you to say anything. Ever think that maybe- What? Nothing. No, what were you gonna say? Nothing, I wasn't gonna say, I don't know, Chloe! Maybe this is God trying to tell us something. God's trying tell us something? Yes, I don't know, I don't know... Maybe this isn't the right time for us. That we should wait to do this later on. Fuck. I'm sorry. Chloe, I'm sorry. - Pull the car over... Just pull the fucking car over Nick... We're in the middle of no where I'm not going to pull the car over right here. Well look where we are Nick stop the car we are in the middle of no where I'm not going to pull the car over- - Nick, stop the car. - Wait stop the fucking car What the fuck are you doing? Are you trying to kill us? I think I saw something. Hey, you okay? Let me see your head. Chloe, where are you going? Chloe. Chloe. Hey. It's okay. Chloe. Don't take another damn step. Leave. Just get back in your car and continue on your way. Chloe, let's go. Did you hurt him? Did he hurt you? Don't you dare touch that boy. You do not understand what that demon is capable of. You're lying. Chloe. This is non of our business. Let's go, come on. Chloe. Just listen to the man, please. Come on. Okay. Okay. Hey. Hey. You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Come on. We're done. Okay. Lets get you back in the car. Wait, Nick we can't just leave. Okay. Don't. Don't. Don't. You don't understand. You don't get it. You don't understand Hey. Hey. It's okay. You're okay. You're okay.

Fuck this, I'm out of here. No, no, no, help me. Sophie? Sophie. Where is Sophie? Who took her? Fuck! "Keep reading." Maybe if we end the game, we can help Sophie. Let's finish this. "She felt guilt and believed that she could save him." This is the last ward to be moved outta the hospital. Guys let's move. Karla. There's still more we can do. That drug is just keeping him a vegetable. That drug is keeping him alive. Judy? Doctor. We need another vial. Well, there's none left here. Maybe in the East Wing but the places is a mess and- - It's okay. Okay. Thanks. Karla, this isn't what he wanted. Keeping him alive isn't right, it's time. Let's go guys.

Somebody? No. Let me out. Please, please, let me out. What do you want? Blake? I can't. What happened? Is it over? That story was about my mama. What do you mean? We all bled on the book. On the stories. I think our blood is fitting the book. It's giving life to it. I don't care. I don't care, it's over. We're not finished. There's another story here. Mom? No, Bea. Bea that's, she's not real, Bea. Sophie? Is that you? My love, it hurts. Mom, is it you? Who are you? England, What have you become? What has happened to your daughters and sons? Are we ready, Magpie. Yes, father. For all have sinned. For all have sinned. For all have sinned, but we don't know how much we've sinned. Like a fish, doesn't understand the concept that it is swimming in the river. It surrounds us. We were born and conceived in it. Born into this fallen world. My friends, I've decided to deviate from my planned topic today because we have witnessed an abomination and we must look to God for guidance. Leviticus 20:13. If a man also lie with man, as he lies with a woman, both of them have committed and abomination. They shall surely be put to death and their blood shall be upon them. What can I say to you good people? It's right here in black and white. Do not dishonor your bodies. And above all else, guard your heart for everything you do flows from it. See the tender age at which the homosexuals prefer their conquests. We must protect your children from the lesbians, sadists, masochists and sexual deviance. And we will protect them. Mark my words. Natural. They used to say it's natural. But they learned a hard lesson. Didn't they friends. Because eventually the river of moral decay ran dry just like the black in the ground. And nature had her revenge and God spoke to us who could hear. Yet, even after all this, we love the abominations. We do not hate them. We do what is fair and right and try to help them back to the path because God cannot love them as they are. Yes. Yes, that's it. Drink from the blood of Christ. Let it purify us. Thank you, daughter. Revelations, 21:7-8, he who overcomes will inherit these things and I will be His God and he will be my people. But, for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and immoral persons and saucerers and idolaters and all liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone Which is the second death. Ethan. Sophie, wait. Bea, I'm scared. Let him go. She wants pure blood. No. Oh, she's coming now. Sophie. Go upstairs and hide in your room. No, I wanna stay with you. Go. Can I come now? Yes, you can come now.
