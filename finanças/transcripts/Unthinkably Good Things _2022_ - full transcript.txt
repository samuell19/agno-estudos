At one time, it was my um, It was my dream to be an author. I'm always learning something new about you. What happened? I focused solely on my teaching career and then there wasn't any time. It's never too late. You sound like my friend Melina. I can't wait for you to meet my friends. Me too. This girls' trip is long overdue. And I hope you have time to meet my mom. She'll be here next week for the truffle hunt. Surprise. I'm honored. But? But do you think we should be doing that since I'm leaving in a couple of months? You're right, but she asked to meet the woman behind my smile, and you're the woman. Alli, this year has been incredible for all of us. If I don't go back to my students at A&T, I might not have any. Okay, got it, so I say, we soak up the sun, enjoy the summer. Hmm... And I've got two more months to work my charm. Come on. Let's go. You haven't said anything since we left the doctors. There's nothing to say. We keep trying. If it's meant for us to have a family, it will happen. As long as you're okay. The weather is nice. We'll get a lot of planting done. Oh. Here's my list. Oh. - Good morning. - Oh, good morning. You're the first ones here. Oh. Well, you know what they say. The early bird gets the azaleas. So, what are we looking for? Well, kale, collards, onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, squash. Maybe strawberries? Definitely strawberries. A big gardener, I see. A new one. I'm recently retired. We're trying our hand at farm-to-table dinners. Let's start in aisle 8. I think this list is ambitious. Don't be scared. Hey girlie. I'm just out getting gardening supplies. What's up? Melina: I can't go to Italy. I'm on my way. We gotta go. What? But I thought we were... Sorry. Okay. This is my third batch. This one has to be good. Okay. Oh! I... Oh! Great! The smell. It's... See? My mojo is off! I told you. Everything is wrong, alright? Oh, my gosh, and I have had this headache for weeks. Okay. First just calm down. And let's just talk it all through. I still can't believe that Tapas is in the red. I know. I told you, I cannot take out another loan. If I do not boost my sales by the end of summer, I just... Don't even go down that rabbit hole. That's why I'm here to help you figure it out. I just don't know why you didn't say anything before today. Come on, you know I've always told you everything, but I was such a burden during chemo. No, no, no. Stop that. You know I wanted to be there for you. But still. I thought business would've picked up by now, and thank you so much for staying with me until closing. Of course. That's what friends are for. Yes. Listen to me, I know you're a fighter. I watched you kick cancer's butt, and I know you're gonna beat this. Is this really all you need? Yes, I told you. Every restaurant that has been featured in this magazine has doubled their clientele, okay? And with their food critic coming unannounced this month, you see why I can't leave. No, I don't. Let one of the managers handle it. It's my restaurant. It's my responsibility. We have not seen our girl Allison in three years, and what about that cooking class you wanted to take in Italy? I know. Why do you think I'm so upset, Reesa? You gotta start putting yourself first. You need to call this magazine, tell them you're gonna be gone for two weeks. Ask them if they can push it back. And then, you and I are gonna go to Italy, and visit our girl. You're gonna take that Italian cooking class and come back with new Italian recipes that are going to blow his socks off. That's the-that's what I'm looking for. That's not a bad idea. Hashtag breakthrough. Breakthrough! Breakthrough! We nailed it! And I love you.

And I was just coming out of surgery, and you leaned over and you whispered in my ear. Now do you remember what you told me? I do. I said hurry up and get well so I can buy you a sexy dress, and you can show off Both: your new girls. - Listen. - Yeah? I know I've said it time and time again but I really appreciate you calling me every day to check on me. But how are you? You still good? - I'm good. - Okay. As long as I keep the stress away, you know? And getting my regular checkups. The doctor says I will be just fine. It is so good to lay eyes on you. You look amazing. And your hair! I know. I...

Can you believe this is a university rental? Do you honestly have to leave? I mean, that's the million-dollar question, and yeah, I do. Did you marinade these olives in lemon juice because they are absolutely delicious. Yes, I did. That's a trick that Nico taught me. Both: Oh, Nico! Oh, I can't wait to meet him! Same. You got this incredible food, this breathtaking view, gorgeous house, and Nico. Sounds like someone is walking away from a perfect life. Oh, no, no, no. I've had a perfect life and one messy divorce. And years of therapy later. And I am not going back down that road. Yeah. But that was North Carolina, Allison. This is Italy! Italy!! Come on. It's no comparison. I've been at A&T for 12 years. Dr. Barnes would have a conniption. Plus, you know, I don't have a job here. So, get one, and then send him a text with this view and hashtag sorry, not sorry. Higher e ducation. I mean, it's very competitive, and uh, but who's starting over at our age? Um... I just retired. So, me? Me too. I mean, my restaurant has only been open a year. Okay, well... good for you. But that's not me. I mean, it's a nice thought, but it doesn't make sense. You know what would make sense right now? - More food. - Yes. We should go to that cafe. The one you're always talking about. Melina: I love this cafe. It's super cute. Yeah. I'm actually really feeling your whole new vibe. You're like the old Allison because you are writing again! Oh, yeah, I mean, I wasn't writing for years, but since I came here, it's just been, you know, flowing up. Italy's good for you. It's stirring up your passion. Oh. That part. Oh... Oh, you know what? Could you write some creative blurbs for my menu? Of course. You know I've got you. Um, how is the restaurant? It's great! Yeah. Reesa, she comes all the time. She'll tell you. It's great. Right, Reesa? Sure, yeah. It's one of my favorite places. Allison: Oh. And how's retirement? Oh. You know. Knocking items off the bucket list. And spending more time with Andre. Oh. You don't sound too happy about that. We just haven't been clicking lately. We needed some time apart. But I'm going to enjoy these two weeks. So, all good. Okay. Well, I'm here if you want to talk. Oh, that's alright. Oh! Dr. Di Grado just texted me to come by his office. Um... do you guys want to go by the campus before we go shopping? Allison: I'm so impressed with your Italian, Reesa. You know, I've been trying. I figure, when in Rome... What? You know like 3 words, okay? That's 3 words more than you know. That's true. And this place? Oh my god. Everywhere we go, it feels like we're in a postcard. Right? Oh, I can see why everyone falls in love here. I mean, it's so romantic. That's the library. Books floor to ceiling. Oh, the chapel, it's gorgeous. I taught creative writing in this building. Four classes every day. Whoa. Isn't that a lot? You know, it didn't seem like it. Back home I taught two English lit classes every day, and analyzing structure and grading papers is far more time consuming. Dr. Cooper, just who I've been looking for. - Buona sera. - Buona sera. I was just coming to see you. Oh. These are my friends visiting from the United States. Reesa and Melina. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. I won't take much of your time. Can we talk? Oh, sure. - We'll be over here. - Okay. My colleagues and I were so impressed with you that we'd like to offer you an opportunity to teach your creative writing class full time. We are requesting you commit for one year, although we'd love to have you longer. The official offer will be emailed. Grazie. What an honor. I understand that this is a career adjustment, but know there is lots of room for growth. That's good to know. Um... Do I have time to think about it? Sure. But the board meets at the end of the day on next Friday. If we don't have an answer by then, we will move on to another candidate. No, no. You will have an answer. - Okay. - Okay. - Thank you. - Grazie. - Buona sera. - Buona sera. So, what are you going to do about the offer? Well, I have to talk with the chancellor before I can even consider it. Hey. It's an amazing opportunity. Yeah, well, I don't want to spend all day talking about it. I want to take you guys to my favorite boutique. You know, I was wondering if we could just go look for cookbooks instead. Are you serious right now? Cookbooks instead of couture? What is going on with you? Mm, you should see the Old Macdonald overalls. You used to have the best style! Whoa whoa. I had the best style. I just didn't have the money. No. Okay, listen. It's fine. I'm just not into fashion anymore. Okay? It's okay. Yeah, but this is Italy. Home to Gucci, and Prada, and Fendi. Listen, Allison. I have other priorities right now. Not shopping. And I don't want to talk about it anymore. I'm gonna look over here. Oh, I didn't... I've already tried. Just let it go. Ooh! This is so cute! Sugar Ray would look so adorable in this. Sugar Ray. You should see the way I dress him. People stop us and give me compliments all the... I should start a doggy clothing line. I can get all different fabrics. I can make all these... You know what? I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna start a doggy clothing line, But I need to order a sewing machine. Do you sew? I do not. I'm adding that to the bucket list. - Oh. - Mm. Oh, I have missed that smell. Homemade coconut chocolate chip. Your favorite. Mm-hmm. Did you tell Nico yet? No. I do not want any pressure while making this decision. Oh, pressure. Like how you pressured me to stay in the Marines? I was looking at your big picture. You could have retired as a Marine Corps Major. Well, what about your big picture? Become a writer in Italy. I think that means... starting over, lower pay, no tenure. Well, actually, you know, starting over could be a good thing. That's a good thing. That's a pro. Yeah. And from what you've told us, Allison, you and Nico, you seem to really enjoy each other's company. Meanwhile, Nico has a teenage son who you've grown fond of. I will take that con and make it pro. Thanks. This isn't helping. That's because the answer isn't on there. It's in here. You're real corny today. It's actually here 'cause it's four pros and three cons. So that means the pros win. - Oh! - Nico: Ciao, Allison! - That's Nico. - Oh! - Hey!! There he is! - Nico: Ciao. Nico!! Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. And I am Melina! Mm. Allison would always talk about you. I could just hear her beaming through the phone. And now I know why. Ah, beaming, huh? Well... I love this wine. A wine connoisseur? No. I wish. I um, I just took some classes so I could be familiar with the wines that we sell at my restaurant. Ah yeah, you are the chef. Yes. I'd love for you to sample my cheeses. I see you say that to all the ladies. Nico: She found me out. Melina: So, how did you two meet? Allison: The second week after I arrived, I went to the food market, and I just happened to see Nico's booth. He offered me samples of his cheese. It was the best Pecorino I had ever had. I went back and bought some more. She claims she came back for more cheese, but what she really wanted was my phone number. And now she cannot stay away from my cheese. He's right. I even help out at the booth sometimes. Awwww. You're such a good girlfriend. What? Did I say something wrong? Well, we both agreed that since I'm only here for a year, we would just date. So... we're not a couple. What? Well, I can call a duck a frog, but it's still a duck. And all I'm hearing from the two of you right now is quack! Quack! Quack! Reesa! Are you okay? I'm fine, I just... I was a week late, so I thought... You thought you were pregnant? No. I just was hoping... maybe. I didn't know you were trying to have a baby. Why didn't you say anything? Because of this. People act all weird when they know you're trying. Okay. I won't act weird. I promise. I knew you couldn't help it. You're already doing it. We've been trying for a year, and Andre really wants a family, but I'm almost 40, so... Okay, Janet Jackson was 50, and she had a baby. Janet Jackson is a gazillionaire and a goddess. True. But... so are you. Thanks. You know what? If it's meant to happen, it will happen, right? Melina: Yes! At least in the meantime, I can have one of these. Reesa, I'm going to be an auntie! Oh god. Hello. Hi! Um, I'm Melina. I guess we are cooking partners. Lucas Williams. Oh! Sorry, it's what we do in London. I'm just here visiting. Me too. I live in California. Mm-hmm. Let's see what we are making today. Ooh. Ricotta and artichoke ravioli. That sounds delicious. Eh, ciao a tutti. Welcome to Cooking with Contaldo. Find your table, place on your aprons, and let's start our food adventure. Alright. You have to be a little tough with it. Okay. Here, let me help you. You want to take the dough, and you want to use your heel, the heel of your hand to push it away from you. And then, you gradually add the flour. Oh. Thanks. You must have a lot of experience with dough. Bread is one of my guilty pleasures. At my restaurant, we actually make our dough from scratch. Have you always wanted to own a restaurant? It's been a desire of mine, and a health scare a few years ago finally made me pull the trigger. So, what's your favorite dish? Well, everything's excellent. No, um, I would say, oh, the flatbread with Shrimp and Romesco Sauce. Okay. Yours? Well, my dad started me in the kitchen as soon as I was old enough for trousers so I have many. But it has to be his brisket patty melt cornbread sandwich. Okay. You put the brisket inside the cornbread? And smother it in Swiss cheese. Hmm. You know, I can't believe it, but that actually sounds pretty good. Mm-hmm. Kneading is done. Time to cover. Alright. Put it in here. Good job. I love roasting these with lemons. Yeah, but have you ever had sunflower artichoke turnovers? What? No. Well, I have to admit I'm obsessed with sunflowers. I'm googling them all the time, and one time this recipe just popped up on my browser. Uh-huh. I've been eating them ever since. Well, you have to share that recipe. Maybe over dinner? Well, um, my schedule is kind of tight. So I'm not really sure about dinner, but I will definitely give you the recipe. Fair enough. Hi, pretty. I'm going to send an email to Dr. Barnes about staying. Another year is not going to make it easier to leave. Shouldn't I just cut my losses? No. Anything can happen in a year. Just send it. Fine. Remember when I told you that Italy looks really good on you? Yeah. So, I've been thinking that maybe that's what I need. You like this place? Are you gonna move here? What does Andre say? I haven't told him. I think I need some time alone to just, just figure things out. Reesa? Are you serious? What's there to figure out? You know what? Nothing that will get solved today. Let's just, let's focus on your email. I actually have the perfect intro. It, uh... You ready? Dear Dr. Barnes. Peace out. Oh. That's Andre. You should take that. Don't tell him about the apartment until you're sure. Right. Yes, Andre. Yeah, um, I'm looking at ten or so boxes all addressed to you. Baby, what is all this stuff? I just ordered some gardening tools, and a small video camera. And some exercise equipment and canvases for our painting classes. And I also just ordered a sewing machine, but it's probably not there yet because guess what? I'm starting a doggie clothing line. A what? A clothing line for dogs. Where's Sugar Ray? You know, I haven't seen him in days. Maybe he's trapped behind all of these boxes. Okay, that's not funny, Andre. So, I'm requesting... that I extend my international teaching position another additional two semesters so that I may finish my research on the matter. Yours truly, Dr. Allison Cooper. Finished! Am I doing too much? Huh? I was just talking to Andre about my new interests. Uh-huh. And he said I was doing Ôthe most'. Well... Well, what? You do be experimenting a lot. It's called a bucket list! It's what you do when you retire. What else am I supposed to do? Okay, don't get salty with me. You asked me. This apartment is looking better and better. Send it. Just send it. Reesa: Just send it! Please don't let me lose my job. Joseph Tate, the food critic will visit Tapas next Monday. You couldn't push it back? Well, they said yes, but apparently no. I've gotta go back home. No. You can't. Eileen is still the manager, right? Let her do it. Eileen quit. She wanted a raise, and I couldn't afford to give her one. So who's the manager? This new guy, Edward, who I do not trust yet. Okay, you know what, Mr. Tate, he doesn't come until Monday, so I'll just fly back on Friday. Allison, she'll just have to understand. Buongiorno! Both: Good morning! Hi! Hey. What's going on? Oh, nothing. I was just about to leave for class. We are going to the spice market today. You know what, I'm running late. So, I'm just gonna meet you guys at the vineyard later, okay? Bye for now! Bye. Well, hi. You look great. No reply from Dr. Barnes. I hope I didn't upset him. You just sent the email. Give him some time. He's got you so shook. I'm not used to seeing you like this. He's the chancellor. He has a lot of power. And I am this close to getting tenured. Okay, you are overthinking this whole thing. You need to calm down. And we need to take your mind off it. Why don't we do one of your cool posts? You can speak, and I'll be your background dancer. We can put it on Tik Tok. Uh, no. We're not doing that. What about this? No. No. And aren't we too old for Tik Tok? We can ride Vespas. I am not getting on a Vespa. Take your life into your hands if you want to. Okay, you're just as bad as Andre. Okay. Are you ready to talk about him? Sure. He criticizes everything that I do. I planned this whole list of stuff for us, and he doesn't want to do any of it. He doesn't want to spend time with me. And that doesn't feel good. Reesa, I know Andre loves you. You need to tell him how you feel, Reesa. Yeah, it's fine. And I'm fine. No. Reesa... Seriously, why don't we just do this video. Come on. I mean, look at this fruit. It's all so fresh. Yes. Yeah. Look at this. You know, being here makes me want to try all new kinds of recipes. My dad would love this place. He's a chef too, you know. We hoped my daughter Noelle would've followed in our footsteps. But not even a chance. She wants to be a makeup artist. Oh, she's beautiful. It's been just the two of us for the last ten years since my wife passed. She's my baby even though she's turning 21. I see you. Proud papa. Mm-hmm. Well, you know, I'm really glad I came. I needed this break. And I had fun yesterday. Me too. I guess we should see what we need to buy for class. Oh, look. Spices. And here we are. Yeah, me too, but... mine are different from yours, and I haven't used half of these. Oh, wow. I used to love experimenting with different spices. But owning a restaurant gives you limited time to experiment. Okay, so what if I challenged you today? Get all the things on our cards. Mm-hmm. And buy three more spices you've never used. Challenge accepted. Okay. And you know what? I actually see sage over here which is on my list. Sage. Fresh sage. Which means one down. Five more to go. Whoa whoa whoa. Hold on. Hold on. The first one to six, to get all six spices takes the other one to dinner. Um, sorry, but is that your way of trying to ask me out on a date again? Well, only if you're saying yes. Well, I'm already one spice ahead of you, so you better hurry up. Oh, and look at that. I have two. Just what I was looking for. That is on my list. Oh, come on. I'll have this please. This region has a history of over 1000 years. This vineyard was a Etruscan and Roman settlement. And we will be having our tasting inside. You've been on your phone all day. Are you going to tell me what's going on? Oh, nothing. I just had to handle some work stuff. - I'll put it away. Sorry. - That's okay. Okay. Let's go. You know, wine tasting is really not that hard. But every little step counts. The way that I learned it was at first you swirl the wine around in your glass just like that. Yeah. Maybe a little bit more. And then you have to smell it before you taste it. Because the smell is connected to the taste. It's called old factory. Hold it up to the light, you can see the depth of the wine. It's got this crimson color. Here's how I figured it. - Alli. - Hi. This is my cousin Mario. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - Oh, hi. His lovely wife, Emilia. Hi. And this is my Allison. - Hi. Oh. - Oh! We've been traveling so much this year, but finally, we get to meet you. Nico, she's beautiful. Nico: I know. Oh, well, your vineyard is gorgeous. You have to come back in September when we do our grape stomping. Right. There's nothing more romantic than getting in a barrel of grapes and making wine together. Hopefully, she'll still be here. What? Well, I have a job. Teaching job back in the states. So I may not be able to come back. - Oh. - No. Look at you two. I have to see more of this. You can't go. You'll be at the hunt tomorrow, yeah? Yeah. Uh, yeah. Yes. And we will talk more about this leaving nonsense. - Good idea. - Alright. - Enjoy! - Ciao! - Ciao! - Ciao! My mom can't wait to meet you. Nico... I am more nervous about meeting your mother than I was about meeting Lorenzo. Oh, no. She's harmless. Invite Reesa and Melina too if you want. Everyone is welcome. Yeah, I will. Um, have you seen Melina? No. Not since she stepped out before. I'll be right back. Tell the chef to create a limited menu with the dishes that I texted you. Just please make sure we have all of the ingredients, okay? My flight lands Saturday night. Hey. I've been looking for you. Oh, um, yeah, Edward. Thanks for checking in, okay? And please call me if you need anything, alright? Okay, bye. Whew! Restaurant business. You know it's always something. What's up? You tell me. I have to leave on Friday. What? Why? The Taste of the Town critic is coming for dinner on Monday night, and I just wanna make sure everything's right. Girl, you're the boss. Delegate. Well, look, if I'm not there, I could get a bad review. And anything less than 5 stars could sink me. There you ladies are. I just bought a book on how to become a sommelier! Not right now, Reesa. The Melina I know would have already bought a frame for her 5-star review. Yeah, well, that Melina was na•ve. And this Melina has been through a lot. No, no, no. I know. I understand. No, you do not understand, Allison. Listen, Tapas is the only thing that I have, and it has to be successful. I mean, I put my blood, sweat and tears into that restaurant, okay? And if I get a bad review in that magazine, I could lose everything. Oh, my gosh. I'm changing my flight, and that's that, so just... Allison: What do you even wear to a truffle hunt anyway? You haven't mentioned Melina all morning. Melina's leaving. What is there to say? You could be more supportive. She doesn't always confide in me. It's hard to support what I don't understand. You know you should talk to her, right? She's always wanted to impress you. You know that. She doesn't have to do that. I'm her friend. A friend with high expectations. Oh. Well. What is that supposed to mean? Okay, look, you were disappointed in me when I didn't go for that promotion. I want the best for the people I care about. What's wrong with that? It just doesn't leave a lot of room for error. To be fair, Melina isn't always honest with me, so, I was blindsided when she said she was leaving. Yes. I... I know. What? - Tapas is not doing well. - What? And she doesn't want you to know. Why? Because you're... Because you're judgy. Ish. Okay, first I have high expectations, and now I'm judgy? Thanks a lot, Reesa. No... I. Look I'm just trying to clear the air. So that we can enjoy the last few days that Melina is here. And I made an appointment to see that apartment. Do not... say a word. Okay. That's what you should wear to the truffle hunt. He adores you. - How are you? - Good. Hello, Reesa. Mama. May I present Allison. Alli, mama. Oh, charmed! And her friend Reesa. Nice to meet you. Oh! Lorenzo. - Ah! - Reesa. - Nice to meet you! - Hello. Lorenzo! Would you show our guest around? Of course. - Thank you. - Okay. You make my son very happy, and that makes me very happy. Oh... Bambini venete. Andiamo. What? Uh, Melina's coming from class, so she's gonna be a little late. No worries, Alli. We're in Italy. We don't have schedules. Oh, that's right. You know, I knew I'd learn a lot in our class, but I had no idea it would be this much fun. Well, Chef is very entertaining, and you, my dear, how do we say, um, blinding. Well, I hope ÒblindingÓ means something good. How would you say? I think in America you guys say, something like uh, awesome? Yeah, you're right. I am pretty blinding. But that's only because my partner is blinding too. Hmm. So let's keep that going. Okay. And take a look over there. Sunflowers! - It is. - Oh my gosh! Look! No more excuses. I need to taste those sunflower artichokes. Oh! How can you not love these flowers? I mean, look, they stand so tall. And no matter the weather, they always find the sunlight. I love Ôem! Everybody here is so welcoming. You're making it so hard for me to leave. Nothing more from your school? Oh, Dr. Barnes replied right before I came here. He's calling me at 8:30 our time. Hoping for good news. I was thinking that we could go to Sanducci at the end of the month. Hmm. I could show you where I was born, and you could meet more of my family. I... I know there is a possibility that you are still leaving, but... So, should we keep getting closer when there's that chance? Okay, but... Yes. Of course I am. There is a saying that I hold very dear. And it's uh, Non rimpiangere mai cié che ti ha fatto sorridere. Uh... Never regret anything that made you smile. Exactly. I-oh. Ooh. Sorry. I was just, I was doing a cheese tour, and I came to tell you I tasted your Pecorino. It changed my life. Meet the ones responsible. This is Lua, Lia, Gia, and Emma. Ladies, this is Reesa. Oh, well, I won't remember your names, but nice to meet you, ladies. These are his real girlfriends. I'm going to start gathering the group so we can be ready when Melina arrives, okay? Oh, okay. - Ciao. - Ciao. Everyone here is so chill. We were supposed to start an hour ago. Yeah, they don't care about that here. Well, that would drive me crazy, but um, you seem to be adapting to the laid-back farm life pretty well. You know, months ago, I had this really stressful day, and Nico brought me here. He told me thirty minutes with the animals, and I would forget everything. And he was right. Emma is my favorite. Hi! Oh, you got a favorite sheep? Come on. - Look who I found. - I made it. So, meet Rosaria and Eve, our guide. We let them roam, and when you see them stop and start to dig, they've probably found a truffle. Hurry to the spot and grab it before they run off with it. That's so simple. Nico: You know the rules, the team with the least amount of truffles has to cook dinner. Tour guide: Good luck, everybody! Alright! Yay! Ohh! I hope you're not disappointed that we lost. I lose every year. I prefer to make dinner. Lucky me, this year both of my ladies are cooking. Truffles are very interesting. I call them the food of love. First... they take a lot of patience to really mature. Second. They require a partner. A partner? Yes. Without the tree's root nourishing the soil, the truffle will die. Hmm. This is ready to go? Uh, yes. Everything is done. Great. Dinner's ready, everybody! There's one more comparison. Uh... I've forgotten, but it will come. This chicken is amazing. Oh, yes. I remember now. Truffles are like love because they are easy to overlook. You could be standing right on top of one of nature's precious diamonds and not even realize it because you are not looking in the right place. You need anything? Yeah, I'm just enjoying... your family, and... my friends. And you. This moment is... perfecto. Oh. I gotta go do my call. Fingers crossed. Hi, Chancellor. It's good to see you. Dr. Cooper, good to see you. It's wonderful to hear things are going well there. We at North Carolina A&T want to always leave a great impression. Well, Dr. Di Grado and his team are very impressed with my creative writing class, so uh, they have asked me to stay another year. Of course, they do, you're one of our brightest. The board and I have discussed the position there, but we feel there's a greater need for you here on our campus. Okay. As Chair of the English Department. I'm sorry. What? Dr. Ghazi is retiring early for personal reasons, and he has endorsed you as a candidate for his position. You will need to have an interview with the board, but it's just a formality. You have my full recommendation, and I couldn't be more proud to give you this standing. This will also secure your tenure. Oh, wow. This is incredible. I will email you the interview time. Right afterwards, I'll need you back in the office. Uh, right afterwards? Say, three weeks? Congratulations, Dr. Cooper. See you soon. ♪ Give a little more space ♪ Come a little closer I can't believe somebody. You better slow down. Oh! Oh! Wasn't that worth the climb, guys? Not worth it. Okay. Am I the only one who's light-headed? Oh, oh! Come here, honey. Come sit down. Okay. Rest here for a minute. Come on. I'm just glad that you and Ree made up. I was not feeling that weird energy. - I wasn't mad. - It wasn't weird. Why were you up so early moving around this morning? Actually I was up late fussing with Andre. He's refusing to take the painting class, and then he had the nerve to tell me I need therapy. He knows good and well I do not do therapy. I take my problems to the altar. The altars don't have PhDs though. - You keep playing with him. - Okay. Are you good? Last night I was offered the chair of the English department at A&T. What? Congratulations! Yeah, I didn't mention it because I just wanted to enjoy our time together. Look. It's just a test. Stay. It's a big salary leap. Guarantees my job until retirement. Staying is too big of a risk. There's nothing wrong with taking risks. Risks. Like apartment hunting alone in Italy. Oh, what apartment? Okay, does Andre know? - He... - What about the baby? A baby? Okay, see, this is why I don't say anything to you. Because I knew you were gonna freak out. Yeah, of course I'm freaking out. You're leaving your husband. And you're having a baby? No! And I am not leaving Andre. An apartment in Italy sounds like you're leaving. Okay. How come you couldn't tell me you were so unhappy? This cannot be happening. I am not unhappy! I'm dispirited! Dispirited? I've been doing a lot of crosswords. Ma'am, a baby? We've been trying, it hasn't been working, and I need a break from it all. And if you'd just stay, I could live with you. Reesa. You need to talk to your husband. When did we start keeping all these secrets? I can't. Take a pretty picture! Reesa. Whoa! Reesa, look I'm not mad at you, alright? I just wish you would've told me about the apartment. That's all. It's not that. Allison is on her way to tell Dr. Digrado she's leaving. It's a mistake. I agree. But I don't want to press her on this, okay? I mean, this trip has already been a roller coaster. Allison said we've been keeping secrets, and she's right. What happened to us? We used to tell each other everything, and now we don't. Well, here's something that you don't know. Lucas asked me to dinner. Twice. And why haven't you gone? You know what? I'm texting him. - No! - Yes. Oh, come on. You know I haven't been out with anyone, you know, since before I got sick. Look, if you mess up the date, so what? After this week, you never have to see him again. Even if I did want to go, it's not like I have anything to wear. Uh, we can fix that. I'm calling Allison. No. ♪ I want the ♪ I want the ♪ Yeah, I want the What? Oh my god! Yes, girl!! You're wearing that dress! You don't think it's too much? Um, that's the one. Yeah. You gotta look amazing. Yeah. I feel like we should take a picture. On three. Remember, like this. Ooh... Ready? And I'm totally getting this outfit. Because it goes perfectly with your yellow stilettos. Thanks! Melina, you are definitely getting that dress. I don't know, I mean... No. It's on me. It's that sexy dress I promised you. Allison. I love you. I can't believe you're going on a date! I'm going on a date. - Yes, you are, honey. - I am. - With that dress. - With this dress. ♪ You got that thang ♪ Got me losing my mind ♪ I'm feeling your eyes all over me ♪ ♪ Feelin' your eyes don't miss a beat ♪ ♪ I don't want to wait for the sun to beat in, come on ♪ ♪ I don't want to talk ♪ already know you're my number one ♪ ♪ Can't take you off my brain ♪ It's like ooh na na, baby ♪ ♪ Ooh na na ♪ You make me go insane ♪ I'm gonna back it up all on you ♪ ♪ Can't take you off my brain ♪ Bring that body up my way, my way see ♪ ♪ Wind it up, it's gonna get lit ♪ ♪ Wind it up, it's gonna get lit ♪ ♪ Wind it up, oh, wind one me ♪ ♪ Take your time, go and grind on me, girl ♪ ♪ Make up your mind, come and ride with me ♪ ♪ Forget your stress, put your mind on me, yeah ♪ Two weeks? Trust me, this isn't easy for me. What do you want me to do? I want you to stay. Don't do that, Nico. You can stay here and... write and teach part time if you want or, you said that was your dream. But I had to put it aside to pay for my ex-husband Lionel's law school. When he left us, I had nothing. I had to go back to work. I had to go back to school. And I vowed I would take care of me and mine. You're not gonna understand this, Nico. But when you're a Black woman, it takes extra clawing and scratching, and many sleepless nights just to get here. And I cannot sacrifice that for anything. Or anyone. You're right. I will never understand what you have been through. But we deserve a chance, Alli. Your dream deserves a chance. I just want to enjoy the time we have left. But I'm not staying here. I can't. Okay. Thank you. I see you hot mama. I needed that makeover, okay? Thank you. How was your date? He ordered a bunch of different appetizers to help me find new recipes for Tapas. He's so sweet. I know! But did you kiss him? Well... I knew it! I knew it! I'm so sorry I was tripping about you leaving. Life happens. I get it. So, you're definitely taking that job back home? Oh, yeah. I meet with the board today. Well, as long as you are doing what you... think is best. I am. And uh... I think we should get breakfast before we go to the museum. I'm gonna tell Andre about the apartment today. And we should probably get mimosas. I can't believe you actually have a lease. It's just six months. Plus I'm signing up for painting classes, wine making, cheese making. Wow. You're going to be so busy, you won't have time to miss Dre. That's the point. No. It's not the point, okay? You are supposed to miss him, right, Allison? I'm sorry, what? Dr. Barnes is sending me department requirements. It's like I've already started working. Wait. What are you gonna do if Andre says you can't move to Italy? He wouldn't. I think he'll be relieved to have me out his hair. Well, when you do talk to him, try not to be defensive. Okay, listen more. Okay, ladies. This is my eat, pray, reset time. Okay? What did Dr. Di Grado say when you turned him down? He said that my loyalty is admirable. And um, he gave me these letters my students wrote me. They're choosing another candidate tomorrow. Oh, wow, look at this one. ÒDr. Cooper's creative writing class Òis not only analytical, but it's also Òtherapeutic. She allowed me Òto tap into parts of my psyche that I'd buried.Ó Oh. ÒI will forever be a better communicator Òand writer because of her.Ó Allison. This is so sweet. Have you looked at these? A few of them. Yeah. I'm sure Allison gets letters like this from all of her students. I don't. Actually. I just had a connection with these students and what we were doing. When you get back home, I hope that you keep writing. Finish that book you started. Reesa: Yeah. You can make time. You know, I think if I were meant to be an author, I would already have a book. So, as it stands, I am Dr. Allison Cooper. Tenured Chair of the English department. Enough said. Congratulations. Thanks. Melina: This is interesting. Reesa: You know what else is interesting? I found a meditation class. The brochure said it was life changing. Yeah. Meditation is great for mental clarity. Yeah, I... Hey. I know you've already been here with Nico, but you can pretend to want to be here with us. Sorry. Work keeps texting me. I get it. We just kind of want you to hang out with us. Yeah. Come on, Allison. You know it's my last day here. Well, you cut your trip short so... Ew, shade. No, I thought you said you weren't upset with me? I'm not. But don't make me feel guilty for working. That was Reesa. You're not going to be happy when you go back. Reesa, I have a prestigious promotion, and a corner office. So. You're only taking the job because you're scared to take a risk. Stop faking the funk. You should stay here, right, Melina? Only if she wants to. Are we doing this right now? Yes. You are scared to take a chance with Nico because of everything that happened with Lionel. I mean, come on, Nico, he's a good guy. Thank you. And you guys look great together. And he treats you with respect. Okay, so you're staging an intervention. - That is not... - No, no, no. We are not. We are not, you know, but... Okay, okay, guys, guys! Stop, stop. Listen, Allison. This isn't about Nico. Look, you're happy here. I can't follow every whim that makes me happy. Staying here does not make sense. I don't know any other way to say it to you. I just want you to be honest with yourself. Honest? Really? I think that's the pot calling the kettle black because you two have not been honest with me since you've been here. How have I not been honest? Yeah, what do you mean you two? Reesa told me that your business is crumbling. And I warned you about opening up a restaurant. I warned you, but it wasn't practical and now you're in debt. Really, Reesa? You told her? And Reesa, you're running around here doing fifty-eleven things when you need to be focused on your issues. Now are you being honest about that? Whoa whoa. What are my issues? Enlighten me, please! Hey, guys, you know what, we don't need to... No, no, no, no. You think you know it all. And it's not just me. Melina says the same thing. Right, Melina? No, no. What I said, you know was that Reesa was having a hard time focusing. Both: Same thing. Anyway, neither one of you can tell me how to run my life when your life is in chaos. Chaos? That is strong. Yeah. Yeah. I told you. This is why I said don't say anything. You do not speak to me. I need to go meditate. But it's my last day... Mmm... Mmm... Mmm... Oh m... I want to work out a long-distance relationship with you because... because I love you. And I'm gonna visit you when school's out, and you can come for the holidays. So... Oh, no. Not, not you. Grazie. Dr. Cooper. Good to see you. Oh, well, it's good to see everyone. You know everyone on here, so we can skip the formalities and jump right in. Sounds good. Why do you want to chair the English department? I want to be chair of the English department because um... Surely you know why you want this. What are you passionate about? Melina: Thanks for letting me come over. Do you mind if I hang out here a little while longer? You know, if you do, I'm going to put you to work, right? Really? I'm, hey... That's good. Thank you. It's even better than I remember it tasting. Okay. I'm sorry. I didn't offend you, did I? No, no, no. It's just been hard for me to connect with someone since I got sick. You never know when cancer might come back, and the last thing I want to be is a burden. Or worse, you know. Have someone staying with me out of pity. Hmm. You know, my mum got cancer when I was 16. And I watched my dad care for her every single day. She was only supposed to live one year after her diagnosis, but she actually lived for three, and I know it was because my dad loved her so much. If I've learned nothing at all, I know for certain that life is not guaranteed and that love should never be taken off the table. Mm. Just when I thought there was no topping this meal. Well, I've got my mojo back. Hmm. I like the sound of that. One second. Please... put that recipe in my book. You have a cookbook? Not quite. My dad made a book of my recipes when I graduated culinary. He says every great chef has a cookbook, and this is mine. Oh, wow. Oh... is that you? There I am. So cute! Wow. This is a really good idea. All my recipes are written on index cards and tucked away in an old shoebox. Hmm. You know, sometimes I get in a space where I start thinking things aren't gonna work out for me, I look back at this, and I think, Ôyou're a chef'. And I know everything is going to be alright. I'm gonna go grab a pen. I'll be back. Hey. I'm gonna need your help with something. I thought you were done talking to me. Where are you? Um... Nowhere special. Your sewing machine came. Okay. What's wrong? The girls and I got into it. Melina was talking behind my back, and Allison, well, Allison was just being Allison. She said my life was in chaos. Well, sometimes your real friends can see what we can't. So where are they now? I don't know. I needed some space. I just feel off. I don't know. It's hard to explain. Well, you used to be chill, and now you're anxious all the time. Because I feel like you don't wanna do stuff with me. Look, I have a job. I can't play with you all day. And you know, I feel like you only want me around to do your projects. And I feel like you don't want me around at all. That's not true. It feels like that. That's how I feel. I mean, I see the way you look at me and... you're frustrated. That's because you're frustrated. Andre, I'm in an apartment. I mean... I mean I'm looking at an apartment. An apartment? For what? I don't know. I thought I needed time to figure this out, but... now it just doesn't feel right. Time alone. So what are you saying, babe? What if I can't get pregnant? Will you still want me? Yes! How can you ask me that? Because I don't know. Look, Teresa, I will always want you. I just... I just wish you were here. Hey. - Hi! - Um... Thanks for returning my text. - Of course. - Yeah. Listen, I know we need to talk and... You know what, let me start. I've been doing a lot of thinking about what you said about me being scattered. - I said unfocused. - Alright. Unfocused. I haven't been the easiest person to talk to. I get it. You seem really calm right now. Um, should I be scared? No. Did you talk to Dre? - We had a long talk. - Okay. And... And I meditated in a field with a bunch of strangers. Oh, well, that's um, different. It's amazing what you can hear when you block out the noise. I miss feeling important. I haven't been feeling needed, and it's been driving me crazy. I'm sorry. That's okay. So, I guess you didn't sign that lease. No. Once I got there, it just didn't feel right. Hmm. Well, look, I'm sure when you go home, you and Andre can talk, and things will work out. Well, we have a lot to talk about, but I hope so. And you know you're very important to me, so there's that too. So what time are you heading out to the airport? About that. So I am not going. And what made you change your mind? Reesa, I have to let go, and trust my team. And have fun in the kitchen again. Look at you! And to think, you almost didn't come. Yeah. Allison is going to be really thrilled to hear this. Hey, have you talked to her? No. Because I've been calling and texting, and... I want to give her this. What? No... Yeah. Okay. Okay! Let's go! Check please! No sign of her. Okay. We gotta call Nico. Ciao. It's us! Allison's friends. Is Allison with you? No. I've been calling her, but she hasn't answered. - Okay. - She hasn't called us back either. - She's missing. - She is not missing. - She is missing! - We just don't know where she is. Do you know where she is? She posted something earlier this morning. She could still be there. It looks like Canale Monterano's church. That's that place she's always talking about. Nico, we're gonna go there. I'll meet you. Ciao. Allison! Allison? Are you here? Oh my gosh. Where... Allison!? Both: Allison!! Hey! Allison, we have been calling you. You scared us. Oh. Sorry. Reception up here is spotty. Well, are you okay? We're worried. Yeah. I'm fine. What's happening? I thought you were leaving? What? No. I'm staying. But we'll get to that. Wow. You had us worried. Listen. I'm really sorry, okay, that I lied about Tapas. It's just you always have everything together, and I was kind of embarrassed that I didn't. Okay, well, number one. I am so glad you are staying. Number two, I don't always have it together. Um... I froze on the call with the board. Melina: Really? Yeah. The more I spoke, the more I realized it isn't what I want. I, Allison Cooper, am guilty of faking the funk. Enjoy this moment, Reesa. You were right. I'm just saying, it's a magical place. You know what? I knew you were gonna say that. I, too, have a confession. I just recently learned that my chakras are not aligned. And that's the reason why I've been so, so bossy and scattered. And I'm working on it. It's not funny. I need something to do. I mean, I retired so that I could have a family. And if I can't... No. I know a lot of good fertility doctors in North Carolina. And we are going to do whatever it takes for you to have the family you want. Okay. You are going to be fine. That's right. Okay, listen. Positive thoughts only. Look! Miss Optimistic is back. Hey! Maybe somebody got her chakras aligned last night. Maybe! Nothing happened! - Stop it! Stop it! - Yeah. I'm just saying! I have to get my chakras aligned! We know you would! Okay. Listen. I'm just back to trusting the universe again. That's good. No more waiting for the other shoe to drop. - And... no more secrets. - Yeah. And no more judging. I'm sorry I haven't been the most supportive friend. Well, you know, everyone needs that best friend that's gonna push them to be great, and that is who you are. Listen. - Now it's our turn. So... - Right. Remember when you said if it was meant for you to be an author, you'd already have a book by now? What is this? ÒUnthinkably Good ThingsÓ by Dr. Allison Cooper. Oh... These are my posts. Or, as I like to call it, um... your first poetry book. And there are more blank pages in there if you should get inspired to write some more stuff. Thank you, both! And I would love to take some of the credit, but this was all Melina. Oh... Look at the last page. ÒFall in love with your fresh start.Ó Did I post that? No, but um, you used to say it to us all the time. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. I did. I can't go, can I? - No, you cannot. - No. Uh-uh. Don't you make me cry. Am I starting over? Right? Yeah? I'm starting over. Oh! Oh, Reesa. Whew! You know, it feels like we're back on that rooftop of our old building. - Oh! - Oh, yeah. And remember? But... this. This is a much better view. I'm taking my freedom. Uh-oh. What you gonna do with it?

No, no, no. I think she's got it. And I think you got it. Ciao! - Arrivederci. - Bye! - Bye bye! - Come on. - Get in the car. - Bye. Ciao Alli. Allison: Ciao. I'm surprised to see you. Reesa called me because she was worried about you and... I wanted to see you before I left. Where are you going? Sanducci, I leave tonight, and I'll be there a few weeks, so probably, when I'll be back you'll... Can you wait? So... I can join you? After my girl's leave? Are you saying you want to meet the rest of my family? - It depends. - On what? Am I still the reason behind your smile? More than ever. So... Wait, does this mean you took the offer here? Oh, the job! Dr. Di Grado meets with the board in thirty minutes. I have to-I have to go. I have to get to the school. Come on! Come on! Let's go! - Uh... - Come on! Where's your truck? Lorenzo's running errands. Come on. Um, I... If you want to stay here, we don't have a lot of time. Come on. Let's go! Let's go! Okay. My helmet. Oh... - Come on, Alli. - Okay. Ready. Hug me. Slow down! Slow down! Slow down! Slow down, Nico! Slow down! Who is that? Andre!! Reesa!! I can't believe you're here! Yeah! I'm so happy to see you. - I love you. - I love you too. Oh... excuse me. Oh! Oh! Dr. Cooper! This is a surprise. I'm sorry to burst in like this, but I, uh, I came to let you know that I really want that position. Oh? I plan to ignite my students' creativity and help them find their voices because... proper language and the richness of English literature are important, but tapping into a student's individual expression is critical to their personal growth. And more than anything, I want to stay here, because I cannot imagine myself anywhere else. Well said. Does anyone here object to Dr. Cooper continuing her position for, how long do you anticipate being here? Indefinitely. Well. Good. No? Okay. Sorry. How are you? Okay. Yay me! Oh, okay. Grazie! Grazie! Buona sera! So? Your girlfriend is staying. Are you? Singer: ♪ Ohhhhh ♪ Yeah I love you. Allison: When you're young, having girlfriends is simple. Understand her language. Support her bad decisions. Love who she loves, and dislike who she dislikes. As time passes, and life gets complicated, it's not as easy to understand her silence, embrace her insecurities, and agree to disagree. But it's a choice we make as girlfriends, and it's sacred. I always knew there was strength in friendship, but along this journey, I've learned there is pure magic in this bond we call sisterhood.
