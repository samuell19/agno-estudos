I prefer the Cardinal, I see it more... I don't know... That one is in ivory, right? Off white. I see it excessive. In white? Price, excessive price. I do not understand the difference. It's the same wood, right? Dad. White is too childish, I can't imagine a sixty year old person stuck in there. I don't know, like this, more sober, right? I personally consider Ruby the most elegant, especially for people of a certain age. But to be honest, it is not the most appropriate for cremation. For incineration the tendency is less wood noble, because really its usefulness is what it is, to look a few hours at the wake... Sorry.. I'm not going to cremate mom. Dad again? And another and another and another. I'm not going to put mom in an oven like it's pizza. I understand that it is difficult for you... But it's what mom wanted, right? You know, it wasn't right when he asked for that, who clung to delirium. Why would he want us to throw his ashes to ten a thousand kilometers from here? To be close to his sister? It was from there, it grew there. But his life was here. It's what mom wanted to. We have no right to decide for her. I have been married to your mother for over forty years, nobody knew her better than me. Please, I ask you not to tell me what she wanted. All of us who knew her can attest to her dedication, of his humility, of his generosity. She was a great mother and a better wife, always supporting herself in a discreet background, he always knew how serve others... Why will it always rain at funerals? You're good? Yes, yes... Only it is strange: the people, the flowers, the rain... They remind me that it is true, that it is a burial... really. The urea ratio is not something exclusive to architecture; actually we find it abundantly in nature, Where does this constantly repeating proportion come from? I've read out there that the slightest change in events of the Big Bang and our universe would not have been created: neither the planets nor the stars would exist, or galaxies, or anything... And there are theories that suggest that everything we see would be practically impossible if it wasn't directed for an intelligent cause. By an architect. But that sounds more like faith than anything else, doesn't it? Because I imagine that when you are talking about an Architect, he is talking about God. He seems like a good Architect, doesn't he? I suppose... But according to physics the probability that it exists God is one in I don't know how many millions. But I am an architect, I am not a physicist. So I don't know what physicists say. But a creator explains many things. If this were a church, probably. How is your name? Antonio Villa. Okay, let's talk about probabilities, since Mr. Villa likes them so much. A man produces, throughout his life, billions of sperm, all genetically distinct. And a woman produces about five hundred eggs. The probability of the sperm giving rise Mr. Villa fertilizes the ovule that gave rise to Mr. Villa, it's a ridiculously small number: the equivalent of one sperm among several billions multiplied by an ovule among five hundred. So, applying Mr. Villa's logic... Mr. Villa does not exist, so it is not worth continuing wasting time arguing with him. Bernardo, my deepest condolences. - Thank you. - How are you? Better, better. Thank you. I'm glad. "Hi, I'm Eli: I left a message." Hi Eli, it's me. I'm calling you because I ran out of dishwasher detergent, if you go through a supermarket, can you buy me one? And shower gel, cheese and sandwich bread... And also, I don't know, fruit, yogurts... What you see out there. Okay? Thank you. "The loss of purchasing power comes to wages intermediates, this is a regression level that creates a uncertainty in people who were not reflected..." Hi? Did you have a party last night? It looks like a student department. What is this? A gift from Juan, a nail gun. And why do I want a nail gun? Juan thought it might do you good to distract yourself a little. Well, thanks, but let your husband know I'm not a retired to waste time on nonsense. What is that smell? Dad, how can you live like this? I am having a little trouble with housework. Give me a bag. You have to start assuming that Mom is no longer here to take care of everything. Yes, I know I know... Did you think about hiring someone? Well... not really, no, what I thought is that maybe you you could come lend me a hand, once a week... No, I don't have time, you know. I'm going to pass the number of the girl who cleans us to us to help you. I do not know where to start. I think we could donate it to Caritas. I don't know, it's weird to imagine another woman dressed in your mother's clothes. It's a shame to throw them away, right? And why don't we leave them here? They don't bother me. No, Dad is not a good idea. It is the first thing they recommend, get rid of clothes of the deceased. Look, you know what you can use the nail gun for. Really, what is the University becoming? It's a freaks fair. Did you see the new teachers? They go seen as homeless, so they go to class. Shut up Bernardo. I'm allergic to listening to you. I am with you, Bernardo. Does it seem so strange to ask a teacher to shower every day? Ah, well, well, well, look at what comes here, very well! Come on, come on, say a few words. Please, this was not necessary... All my life I spent in the same house. It is a house that is getting too big for me. I thought about selling it, but in the end I couldn't... There I got married, there my children were born, there I divorced my wife... There I was happy and unhappy, in that order. The truth is that I never liked the changes. And neither does this one, but hey, it's time to retire... It is what it is. Does anyone know what is sung in retirement? Yes? Dad, I'm Eli... They desecrated Mom's grave. Dad? Dad? Yes, a few months ago they opened a couple of niches, but something like that This is the first time it happens. Official, seriously, at least since I work here... What happened, dad? I don't know, I was fixing the counter frame and I I woke up here, I don't know. It's hard to believe that someone could have an accident with a DIY gun... How you ended up with four nails on your head... Look dad, I know what you're going through and I understand that you're a little confused by what happened... But it's not your fault. I dreamed of mom. Well, everyone dreams of their dead... I don't know, see her there. Daddy, don't give it any more thought. Some scoundrels did a wild thing and it just happened to be us. It's just that. I'm going to crema mom. I will fulfill your wish. Hi. Well, I imagine you will wonder what brings me here... I came to fulfill Cris's last wish. Tomorrow I am going to throw his ashes into the sea. I thought maybe they would want to join me. But if my sister has already been buried. It's just that something happened... They desecrated her grave. None of this would have happened if you had cremated her as she wanted; but no, you had to decide everything until after death. Deep down it always bothered you that we were so close. That is what happens to you. I think you should have this, it's from Cris. You know I have always considered Bernardo someone very smart, honest, upright; the kind of husband that every woman wants at his side. I have been... envied, yes, why not say it. Although it has been too high a price. I'm not saying we haven't been happy, but... I've always had the feeling that I left too many things on the way. You say my last letters sound sad. It is true that I feel a little strange... Can you ever ask yourself what would have happened to his life if he had done this or that, but hey I suppose it is something that happens to all of us at some point... Lately I remember a lot about Las Marinas. I think it is the only place where I have felt truly free, plus myself. I wish they would throw my ashes there, but for Bernardo it is unthinkable that we are not buried together. You know him... he's so adamant... Sometimes I look at my life and I see everything so monotonous, so bland... Every hour of the day what should happen happens. Every day is how I know it will be. Yesterday I had a horrible thought, I'm ashamed just thinking about it. We were eating and I looked at Bernardo and I wondered why I had to die, why me and not him who is a living dead. I know it's horrible, but it's what I thought. Any problem with food, sir? No, can I have another glass of wine, please? Yes of course, excuse me. Excuse me, we are closing now. But if you want you can continue in the casino that is a few hundred meters below. Okay, bring me the bill, please. Okay, right away. It doesn't go anymore. Isn't the waiter coming? Seven, odd, red... Look how they go... The motherfuckers! Do we change the seats? Huh? It is very unlucky for me someone sitting at my left. May I? I am very well here. At... twenty-eight. It doesn't go anymore. Twenty-eight, pair, black. Do you see I told you, that's how luck works. Waiter... A Brandy, please. Oh, gambling and alcohol, what a bad mix. No, good, good. That's why I came, to drink, to eat, to lose my money at the Casino... To do all those stupid things that people like so much. ISN'T THAT WHAT THE LIVING DO? Well you went to find the ideal person because I am stupid stuff specialist. Matías, a bourbon. Didn't you say it was a bad mix? I said that? I do not remember It doesn't go anymore. How's it going, Bernardo? Huh? Where I am? You do not remember? Well, almost better, last night you screwed up a bit. We were kicked out of the casino because of you. Do you remember me? Abel Rodríguez-Cortés, sales agent and MD manager of Costa del Sol Realstates. And since last night your brother. But you can call me Abi. Here, this is going to do you good. No no no no. Here. Ok, if you don't want... I think the first thing we should do is go back to the casino to apologize. You were very pig last night, Bernardo. It was a lot of fun. Do you know a place called Las Marinas? Yes, of course, it is well known here. Although I have never been. Is it because of your wife? What is that? You don't remember either... You had a little fit of rage last night. You said very ugly things to it... But don't worry because... we vacuumed to the last speck huh? I can accompany you to the Marinas if you want, but I have to stop by the office first. But it catches us on the way, you don't mind right? You can drive? If you don't mind Bernardo, wait a moment for me here, I'm going to for the card and I'll be right away, okay? Hi! How are you? Your ex called, she is very angry, she says that if you keep it up, you'll go straight to court. - Yes Yes Yes Yes... Find me the Mirador file, please Julieta. Look, you didn't believe me, did you? Well there it is. Hey, Abel... We... We have talked among ourselves and we have decided to say enough is enough. Let's see... I'm just asking you for one last effort. Yes, but we have already made many efforts. We have to hold out until summer, as soon as it starts the season we will go back. And what do I live on until summer? I remind you that I have two children. Well... and I also have two children. What are you telling me Abel? Do you want me to lend you money on top? Let's see what happens with the unemployment? We pretend to fire you, you are collecting unemployment... But why don't you accept that proposal? And we work for you for free, right? No, you don't work for me for free, we just postpone we defer payment. As soon as summer comes, we sit down and catch up. Are you talking about what I imagine? Clear. Hey, please, let's hold on a bit, I've got the customer out there. He is a very important architect, he is a professor and comes from the hand of a group of investors. Do you really want to spoil everything now? Here it is... El Mirador. Thanks, Juliet. I don't want to throw the bells on the fly, but I think that I will place the Mirador. Only with this sale we can last until Easter, rents start to move and then summer is here. We are going to put all our energy here, I ask you please, huh? This will save our ass, you will see. Bernard. Good Morning. Good Morning. Can I help you? Yes, excuse me, I would like to ask you a question... Although I don't really know if you are the person with the one I should talk about... Tell me. It happens that my wife has passed away and we are seeing the possibility of throwing her ashes here. This was a very special place for her. I can not let you pass, sorry, it is only for partners. How do you become a partner? Yes, you need the naturopathic card issued by the International Naturist Federation and the invitation of a Club member. Hello, one question. Tell me. We have an invitation... This is not the place. If you want we can go... But with that name and your wife's description... How do you know how my wife describes it? Let's see, last night I had a hard time sleeping... Because... the truth is that I can't sleep if I don't I have nothing to read. Did you read my wife's letters? Man, read, read... Yes. Of course you spent the whole night saying that if letters that if my wife... I can not believe this. Well, you read them too. She's my wife. Precisely, she is your wife, she is not mine. I have no moral conflict here. - And going back to the matter, - I don't know any other place to be called Las Marinas. Excuse me, I need to make sure this is the resort that my wife came, her name was Cristina Vera. Do you mind waiting for me to attend to these gentlemen? I do care because I got there first, attend to me first. Was she a member? I don't know... I guess not. You said she was called, forgive me... Cristina Vera. No one with that name appears. And you don't know if there's somewhere else around here to be called Las Marinas? Bernardo, taking advantage of the fact that we are doing time I'm going to teach you one thing... Because yesterday when you told me you were an architect, uh... about your classes at the university, how your students respected you... I kept thinking. Look. What is this? You see, Bernardo, I have a group of investors... Who are going crazy looking for a building for rent luxury tourist. Well, it occurred to me that if you did a project for me... Because these people have the money, eh, but they can't see the possibilities that the building has what I'm offering you... Look, if you offered to build me an auditorium, it may be that at another time we discussed it. But no. I am an architect, this is not architecture. Sure... Because you'd have absolute freedom, I know what it is having a professional and then not letting him work... Everyone thinks, but... But hey, if you are not interested then... Because, you are not interested in it? No. Okay, we talked about it another time... Here comes Amalia. Amalia! Hello, Abel. Look, Bernardo... Amalia... Hello... A pleasure. If you want, can we talk about the conditions first? He and I have already discussed it, we think everything is fine. Well, I clarify that I am Public Relations, but... there ends everything. I don't want confusion later. There will be no confusion, I don't need anything from you. All I want is to get in there. So I don't care if you're a PR or a road prostitute. I forgot the most important thing... I can't stand assholes. Well... shall we sit down? Well, I've talked to a friend who's a member of Las Marinas and he will fax the invitations to the resort. Here... I have your naturist cards, here you go... Now I take some photos with your mobile and put them there. And most importantly: they only let in hosted clients. Yes we know, we stayed for one night. Minimum two. Well two... nights. She skates well, right? How can you have that lack of modesty? If I had that body I think I would lock myself in a basement and I would leave only at dawn, so that no one would see me. Well, I find her very sexy. We should be thinking about dinner, right? When I eat, the tension goes down. I'll stay, I'm not hungry. Yes, Eli was with her, yes. Eh... He sent me to a resort that seems to be where they came together. It is a very... happy place. But I don't know what I'm going to do yet. Well, we're leaving? Applaud the sunset... And when it goes wrong, a cloud is put in front, for example, What do they do?, boo it? How can you be so stupid? Here you go, you are a better person when you drink. Let's get out of here please. Now I understand what your wife said in the letters. Because... it is true that here one feels much freer... Can you stop talking about my wife like you know her? Come on, Bernardo, what's going on? Remember your battle cry from last night? "We are alive!". Nothing happens because we enjoy a little, right? I am not enjoying. It is not so difficult... All we have to do is let the child we have inside come out, right next to the fascist dwarf that we also carry inside. Either one leaves or the other leaves. Okay, okay, I propose something else. See that guy over there with the sardines? That's the kind of person who knows everything on these sites. We go there, eat something and see what it tells us, he still knew your wife. Do you have a picture of her? My goodness, what skill do you have How long have you been with this? Buff... I don't even remember. "Braulio". Your name is Braulio, right? Braulio, can I ask you a question? Yes. Does this woman sound familiar to you? Her name was Cristina... Vera, Cristina Vera. No... It doesn't ring a bell. But you can ask the Swedish. He has been coming here all his life and he knows everyone. The Swedish? And where can we find La Sueca? Well, a little while ago he was here, but he just left. Sleep there. But I don't think I'll be back until tomorrow. Pay the gentleman. Bernardo... Very discreetly, behind me. The one on the right for you and the one on the left for me. What? Oh, if you don't like chubby... I keep the fat one. What happened? I'm going to sleep. But did I say something that bothered you? It was just for hanging out. Did we come to hang out? Do we rent a bungalow that costs a fortune and that I pay me, to pass the time? Bernardo, look around you. I think we already know what your wife was up to, right? We have already seen everything we had to see. That can have a thousand explanations, maybe Las Marinas was not like that when she came or there was another Las Marinas somewhere else... What is for sure is that this shitty place and my woman have nothing to do. Good night. Where are your hearts? In Las Marinas! I do not hear you: Where are your hearts? In Las Marinas! Where are your hearts? I don't see them! In Las Marinas! What's up handsome? Hi? Oh excuse me, I almost put my ass in his face. Don't worry, we all have one, right? Bernardo is my name. Acke. Acke. Are you Swedish I was many times in Stockholm. It is a city that fascinates me. You are also Swedish, right? No, they tell me the Swedish here for the friend. Ah, The Swedish. What a coincidence. I heard about you. Because I believe that you were friend of a relative. Cristina Vera, does it ring a bell? By the name, I don't know... I'm not falling right now. Ah. Wait a moment. Let's see if you remember her now. Of course I remember her. She came with... What was he called? Simon... Simon I think his name was. And... Cris and Simon were... friends? Yes friends. "Friends"? Will you not be her husband? No no no. I am a cousin... distant. I was actually coming with a large group of people. He liked to talk about cooking. I really like cooking, you know? Me too. And do you have any idea where I can find this guy Simon? Look, there is our captain. Captain? We have a small boat docked here to rent. I'm going to ask, see if you know anything about this Simon. Well your boat is the one over there. I need to have a coffee, first of all. Can I? You took it from my mouth. I have a hunger that can eat a dog. I go to the bathroom. I feel sorry for Bernardo. Deep down he seems like a good man. You are good friends, right? Since when do you know each other? Since Friday. You don't know him at all? Yes, since Friday, I have already told you. Why? Because I think you will need a friend. I do not get it. What do you think is going to happen when that guy says, 'Yes, I have been with your wife for several years and you are such an dumb-ass that you didn't noticed. Nothing is going to happen. You can see that Bernardo is a very whole person. Man! How's it going? Yes, well look... just remembering you because I'm in Banús, right now... Yes, yes, I, yes... Let me speak, I have the money practically already in the bank huh? Thought it could go like this. Isn't it wrong to go in a shirt? No, what's up, it's fine. Is something wrong with you? No. Would you mind joining me? Are you waiting for me in the car? I'm leaving now. I'm here. We can't come with your wife in a tupper. Taking. We will introduce ourselves with the ashes. We will tell him that we have come to throw them into the sea and that we want him to join us. I think that will disarm him and tell us what he has to tell us. Bernardo... Look at me. It is important that you are safe. It may not be very pleasant what you're going to hear. Hi? Simon? Hi? Is there someone on the boat? Simon? Yes, it's me. We came to say goodbye to Cris. Cris? But go up, go up... Don't stop there. Sit, please. Excuse me, but with age my memory dances more and more... I don't fall... Cris? Ah... Of course I remember her... Yes, yes, of course... So nice, so modern... What good times in Las Marinas. This was not the typical siti or vacation. No neighbors who do not greet you, no conversations supermarket... Of course I remember... She was with us for many years. I think we help her on her way. Excuse me, but I don't understand... what do you mean by “her way” Was she your wife? Yes. Do you know what we did in Las Marinas? Your wife didn't tell you what she was coming for? Okay, yes... I'm not really sure actually. No, she didn't tell me, no. We had a Personal Growth group. A Personal Growth Group? Yes. Personal growth? Excuse me if I seem rude, but I never thought that my wife could be interested in that kind of thing. What do you mean See, I am very respectful of beliefs from others, but... that of surrendering to a shaman to solve his life one... I do not swallow, no... I am a psychotherapist, not a shaman. It has been a pleasure. Thank you very much anyway. You have been very kind to assist us. You have behaved like a donkey. With how polite the man has been. Polite? It is a cheek. Did you see the boat we just got off? Can you tell how he paid for it? But it's the fault of weak people, like my woman, that when feel confused instead of seeking support from people who they love her, they take refuge in this class of gurus who fill themselves with gold calling depression sadness... Please. Is that Abi? Ahead! Is this a small boat? Now in low season they are only eight thousand a day. But if you are interested I can make you a price. How has it been? We are happy? It was her psychotherapist. Was your wife hooking up with her psychotherapist? It seems rather that the guy runs out of money. Ah well, but that's normal here, isn't it? Do you want to have something? What is that? Mate? From the latest clients; Argentines like you, and lined to the eyebrows. I like this. Well then it will have to be lowered a bit. Take what you want huh, if these people don't even know what they have. No, no... I just look out of curiosity. This is Popper. And that? Abiii. Damn, but how did these Argentines ride it, right? Do you want to try it? No no thanks. Come on man, for a day nothing will happen. What effect does it have? The effect is... Absolute Happiness, Bernardo. I don't know I can think of a better way to describe it. No... I just don't know how it can hit me... It will hit you very well, I guarantee that. Drink, come on. Come on Bernardo, come on... No, no. Why is vodka prohibited at airports? According to a scientific study done here and now, before all and in the eyes of all, it is shown that vodka does not burn. Of course, now I'm not like to publish an article, huh? Abi, come on! Being an architect, you should really enjoy yourself here, right? I say this for the mansions and that... When you go to a city, what is the first thing you visit? Its monuments, right? That is Architecture. Do you think that the Alhambra and all these mansions that they seem cakes of communion have something to do? Architecture is one of the Fine Arts. This that surrounds us is closer to the confectionery. Well, I would love to live in one of those "cakes". When I return home, from the bus, I see them... and I imagine my children running around the garden... You have children? If not what was I going to put up with, old slugs... Sorry Bernardo, I didn't mean you. Do I look like a slimy old man to you? No, no, no, really not at all. I'm going to bed. Good night. For that wonderful woman, who loved you so much and who We both miss it so much. What are you going to do? What am I going to do with what? Are you going to throw the ashes at the Marinas? No, not crazy. I wouldn't throw an orc's ashes there. Why don't we take the boat and toss the ashes out to sea? This is the night: the perfect moon, the sea is calm... I'm going to eat something. To catch prey you have to master art of conjuring. The lure attracts a helpless mouse. The snake attacks. Bernardo... Bernardo... What? Hey, they ask for you. The psychotherapist, do you remember him? Ah! You're good? Don't scare me Bernardo. Ok, ok... You sure? Come, I help you. Good? Better? Hey, I'm so sorry about last night, huh? That the security of the port thought that we were stealing. I should have warned you that we would be here. Good Morning. Yesterday I had a little accident. No thanks, it will only be a minute... After you went and I was looking through my notes... There was something that didn't quite fit me... Then I discovered that my patient was called Marga, not Cris. How? I got confused. From what you see, it was not your wife. But you saw it in a photo and recognized it. Yes, the truth is that they seemed like two drops of water. But she also always came with her husband. As far as I know they had been married for several years. Who was her husband? Has it gone yet? This may not be the best time, but... I wanted to ask you for a favor. I would like you to call my office asking about me and when they tell you I'm not ask about the Mirador. I don't know if you remember, I showed you yesterday. It's... Here it is. It is a building that has come to us through an embargo that is in the area of plaza del Mar... You see, I have a little financial mess and I need to buy time... I know you're not interested, huh? but. If you could lend me a hand. It occurred to me that you might pretend commissioned a project to study the operation. You know, we... questions information, that if the catastrophe I do not know what, that if we you put homework to go to urban planning like this... the guys in the office are entertained and they think there is something. The case is that I need to hold on until summer if I want to save my company. Because... if I drop the whole thing now I I do not know what I'm going to do. I don't know if I told you that I have separated... I've been... sleeping for three months incognito in the houses we have for rent... Bernard? You're good? I'm fine. I don't know if you heard what I told you... I need to go to... Bernard! Bernard? The patient at four says he is leaving. There is no way to make him see reason. What are you doing? I'm going. I guess you know what's on your head, don't you? They look like nails. I shot myself with a nail gun. Is it porteño? I am from Parque Patricios. AHA. Look, I don't want to fool you, but... it doesn't look good. I don't know if he knows that one of the nails in his head is alive. Alive? It moves to the brain and will end up killing it; It may be in a week or maybe within a year. There is a possibility of intervention, but... it has too many risks. Do you have family here? You have five minutes. Bernard. How are you? You have to get me out of here... The psychotherapist says that she was married and that Her name was Margarita... It's crazy... But how can you worry about that now? And they lived in Casares, a town in the interior, we have to go. But where do you think you're going? My family came to pick me up, they take over. Until they bring you up to the floor you can't ask voluntary discharge. You can't keep me here. Go back to bed or we will sedate you. I'm going to tell my insurance company not to pay anything. No one is going to pay for this. Well, the visit is over. Be a little patient, Bernardo, and try to rest. Car keys. What? Car keys. Ah, what are you going to do? Good. Hey... I'm going to leave you the Mirador brochure... In case you have time... you see that you can call, if you feel like it then... By the way, drugs are free here and you feel great. Oh yeah. I know how it feels. I have been on the verge of death twice in the past year. And here I am again. They say that dying doesn't hurt, but... it's horrible. I do not recommend it to anyone. First you feel like a very big tickle, as if your whole body has fallen asleep. Suddenly you realize that you are floating in the air... Can you lower your voice please? And when you turn, you see yourself down there, lying in bed... dead! And you without being able to return to your body. And when you finally get back, it takes a long time in learning to communicate again with the real world. But then everything goes back to normal. Sometimes I feel like giving up and I look this machine and I say... Why don't you run out of light and get done with it all at once...? Give up, give up! What prevents it? Do yourself a favor and let someone turn that fucking machine off for you, that's how we all rest. But what are you doing here? You can't be here please, you have to get out. Ya... Ya, ya, ya, yes. Already. Well Luis, you look great huh? Cris is dead. Sorry? Cris. My wife asked us to throw her ashes here. I confess that at first I was wondering why. Because we were always together. We wanted each other... But now I know. Fancy a glass of wine? How did they meet? His sister introduced us. I belonged to a Gestalt group and invited her to come one day. She was very depressed... and so it began. We left him every time he left. But the following year... It became a kind of fantasy, once a month every year, she was my wife. Everyone said we fit together like two masterpieces. The only problem is that she had a husband. Filthy sea walrus... Of course she had a husband. I was her husband! I, was, me. Ahhhh... Sorry, I didn't want to hurt you. Motherfucker. Get away or I'll hit you with this. Ahhhh... Here are a hundred and fifty kilos, enough to tear you apart... You took advantage of a weak woman telling her stories, motherfucker. "Two Masterpieces". Were those the lies you said to her? Not true, huh? And she gawked at a sea walrus... You never worried about meeting the person who you had by your side... Because you were so busy looking at yourself, while Marga was fading. Not Marga. Cris, Cris, Cris... Oh, sorry, sorry. Wait take this... I don't know what happened to me, I let myself go. I apologize. Shall we taste this wine? Are you ok really? Yes, yes, yes. For... her. For her. You need to vent. You need to get all of that out of you. Hug me. What? Hug me. No, no... Thank you, but to me those things... do not suit me. Come on, nobody sees you, it's just you and me. Cry. You have to acknowledge the pain, it will set you free. Cry. Pain is not our enemy, it is our partner. Give it its place. There is something that belongs to you. This house belongs to your wife. She was planning to move here. But she never came back. She chose what anyone would have chosen, right? She stayed with the weakest... He knew that I I wouldn't have endured it. If you want something, I'm home. There he is. Here he comes boys! Hi, the truth, the truth is you didn't take me by surprise... Thanks anyways, thank you very much. We will miss you Bernardo. Do not have the slightest doubt. Thank you very much, what are you doing? Maybe I was expecting something, I don't know, bigger from all of you... Burning the classroom in my honor, for example. Overall, what will it do once I leave... You can shut your mouth, you are capable of ruining your own farewell. As Bernardo is a fan of cakes, we brought an empanada. Very good, very good, very good. I don't know whose idea it was, but it's very good. And do I have to blow out the candle? Well... ay ay ay. There is. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Bernardo, always giving us the beating and the day of your goodbye, aren't you going to say a word? No, no, no. Yes please! No, no, no, no, no. Please don't do this to me. Well, okay, okay, I have no other choice. I don't know what to say. I always thought that the world is very big and that we have very little time. Very little. That we could live a thousand lives... different. But you have to choose only one, right? And. choosing is always very difficult. What I have to say is that... Today I look back and I think that... of all lives... possible... I kept the best. I kept the good one. Didn't you say you weren't going to get cheesy? Huh? I love you.
