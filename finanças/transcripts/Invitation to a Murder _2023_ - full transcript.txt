Thank you. Miranda. - Miranda! - Mm. Oh, sorry, Annette. It's just-- it's the new Christie book. Aren't you supposed to be at work? I would not make it through the day if it were not for this book. Oh, nonsense. You have a job, you don't live in a boarding house. Well, you've done quite well for yourself. Oh, so, that's it then? At least you're surrounded by stories. I'm surrounded by plants. Flowers, Miranda. You're surrounded by flowers. I mean, you spend your days surrounded by beauty and all you can think about are your morbid little stories. Little stories? Would that we could live a life a quarter as Inspector Poirot. Solving cases, uncovering plots, finding truth in all of the lies. Creating order out of the chaos. These are not little stories. Oh, speaking of, were you able to find any more criminal-- - It's from 1907, but-- - Annette! You're so wonderful. Thank you. - Of course. - Oh. Oh. - Miranda. - Hmm? Shouldn't you be getting to work? Every contact leaves a trace. Oh. Oh, oh, dear! Oh, my! - Let me help you. - Thank you, Miranda, dear. I passed three others and you were my only tenant to offer a hand. Oh, I'm sure they just didn't notice. Well, that's what I like about you, dear. You are always paying attention. Good evening, Mrs. Cavendish. Oh, I almost forgot. A man dropped this off today. Did he say who it was from? No, but he didn't seem the courier type by the looks of his suit jacket. Perhaps, he's a gentleman caller. Oh, one would have to meet gentlemen for them to come calling. Well, good night. "Miss Green, you have been cordially invited to Abbott Island for an audience with Mr. Lewis Findley over the upcoming weekend. All will be explained onsite, please pack accordingly. You may find your travel accommodations enclosed." Where's the return trip? "Few concrete facts are known about the English textile magnate outside of his extreme wealth, estimated in the billions. The rest is hearsay and speculation." Well? I think it's a strange proposition and you should take heed. You've no sense of adventure. Adventure? I'm all for adventure. But, Miranda, I know you better than this. You're careful, pragmatic, and most of all, smart. And smart girls don't run off to islands, because they received an unmarked letter. It has Findley's seal. You said yourself the seal is different. Well, I'm currently working on a theory about that. Miranda, be reasonable. You're not Scotland Yard, you're a florist. What would your mother say? You're being robbed. What? That makes no sense. Sir, you can take the books out of your pockets now. I beg your pardon? There were 46 books on the rear bookshelf, there's currently 44. She would say it'd be safe. Ah, here for Findley, I suppose? Well, allow me to introduce everyone. This is Miss Lu Wang. Not much of a talker that one. Then these chatterboxes are Phillip Armstrong, doctor, and make no mistake, he will remind you. Well, my mother is very proud, as is my uncle, - who is one of the top-- - Yes, fascinating. And then we have-- Ah, I'm terribly sorry, dear. I've already forgotten your name. My name is Carmen Blanco. Pleased to meet you. And what about him? That is Donald Walker, an American journalist. Best to steer clear of that one. He's a bit of a-- Watch it, Kane. Yes, well... Lawrence Kane at your service. Barrister by trade, London's foremost man about town by reputation. Miranda Green. Florist. Ah, Miranda Green, florist. Welcome to our little party. They're all the same. Myself and those two already checked. Hmm. And no one's met Findley? No. No connections at all. There shouldn't be six. I beg your pardon. There should only be five people on this train. Ah, I, uh, I don't follow. There are five leaves on the seal which shouldn't be there. They don't appear on Findley's seal anywhere else. It must have something to do with the invitation, those invited, but it doesn't make sense. There are five leaves and six people. I'm sure it's just a coincidence. I suppose it could be. Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Gordon, Lord Findley's valet. If you can please make your way to one of the cars, - we're a bit behind schedule. - Could you please tell us-- All will be explained in due time, Mr. Armstrong. Now, if you'll please make haste. Weather conditions have made the trip to the island-- Precarious. It's all a bit precarious, ain't it? Right. Allow me to introduce Sean, the house butler, and Katherine, our maid. They'll be at your service for the duration of your stay. That's it? Findley couldn't afford more help? Lord Findley prefers a more intimate staffing arrangement, sir. Yeah, sure he does. Excuse me, where is Mr. Findley? - Uh, master-- - Lord Findley's plane was grounded by fog. There's an approaching storm and he will be joining us tomorrow. That doesn't leave us much time. I took off almost a week of work to be here. Forget almost. I was on a story in Valdosta. You know how long it takes to get from Georgia, to New York, to here? Of course you don't. Well, five hours by rail to Atlanta and five hours by plane to New York. Yeah, okay. Alright. You will have the appropriate audience with Lord Findley, my dear. I can assure you of that. Well, if you'll allow me to show you to your quarters. Uh, Sean and Katherine will bring your belongings shortly. Quarters. I've never stayed in quarters before. It's a room. Welcome, my dear. Lord Findley has instructed us to proceed with the weekend as planned. As such, there will be cocktails in the lounge, once you've settled in. Welcome to the east wing. If you'll follow me to your individual quarters, the east wing houses Lord Findley's guests. Mr. Walker. I think you'll find your accommodations-- Ms. Blanco, Ms. Wang, and Mr. Armstrong. I think you'll find your accommodations more than satisfactory. I think this will suffice. Follow me. Oh. Mr. Kane. Ms. Green. Oh, uh, promise me you'll keep it down, dear. I'm a bit of a light sleeper. Only if you guarantee the same. Hm. Don't fret, Miss Green, Lord Findley knows his guests value their privacy. The rooms have been soundproofed. I still find it funny. Thank you. My, my. My, my. - I had not seen that... - No, well, I think... Ah, Miss Green, what a pleasure it is to have you join us. Would you care for a refreshment? He makes a splendid Manhattan. Well, the master also has a stocked cellar from his private vineyard. That would be splendid. A vintage the master was particularly fond of. Was? Hmm? Oh, my apologies of course. No, the master simply had a... well, a change of taste. Well, it's certainly better than what I'm used to. Not much of a drinker, are you? I prefer to keep a clear head in unfamiliar surroundings. Eh, that's smart. I got this, thanks. Oh, Mr. Walker! What? The old man won't miss it. Will he? Of course not, sir. Hmm. A toast, shall we? Since we're all finally here together. What a lovely idea. Come on, come on, come on. Gather around. You too, Walker, you can brood later. Up, up, up. What shall we toast to? To our generous host? To the workers he used and discarded. - Oh. - Why don't we toast to new friends? Whatever the reason and wherever the location, we're all here together. In this world, it's a small miracle. - Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers. Oh. Terribly sorry. Oh, bloody hell. Quite bit of a fight. Why don't we all get to know each other a little better? - Ooh. - Ah. Shall we play a game? A delightful idea. I assume we all know how to play Two Truths and a Lie. - Nope. - Oh, God. Oh, stop it you two. This is going to be fun. - Mm. - I shall go first. - I am from Seville, Spain. - Mm-hmm. I am a waitress at my father's restaurant. - Hmm. - Lie. Huh. Your bag looked to be secondhand, and your coat, it was a child size, English in origin. But if your father owned a restaurant, it would stand to reason you would be able to afford at least one of the two, so... That's remarkable. Is that true? Yes. I-I never knew my father. Oh, Carmen. Dear, I'm-I'm so sorry. I didn't-- Hey, it is alright. Good guess. Yeah, but it's not a guess, is it? How did you do that? I just pay attention. I have a good memory, I suppose. No, I have a-a good memory, this is-- this is something else entirely. Now, this is getting good. You go, Doc. - I don't-- - No. No, we're doin' this. Come on, kid, two truths one lie, go. Very well. Um, I graduated from Oxford, my father also graduated from-- Lie. You don't know your father either, do you? He's dead, isn't he? Come on, how? Well, his shoes weren't properly polished, and on the train, when he spoke of his family, he skipped from mother to uncle. So, it stands to reason-- Stands to reason. My father passed, too, if it's any consolation. It appears we have our first commonality. No, my father is alive and well in Guangzhou. Um, and you, Lawrence? Buckinghamshire. Mr. Walker? - I'll play next. - No, I didn't-- One, I'm a reporter for The Daily Truth. Two, my mother's dead. And three, I've never killed a man before. Three's the lie. Game over. Asking the wrong questions can get you hurt. I would suggest you not wander too far. The house is easy to get lost in. Oh, I have an excellent sense of direction, but thank you for your concern, Gordon. The master's dog, Blunder, passed some weeks back. Then why keep the water fresh? Well, the master was very fond of his dog, and I should think he rather enjoyed the ritual of tending to him. Now, if you'll follow me, please. Dinner will be served shortly. Oh, I can make my own-- I must insist, Miss Green, hmm? This is not your house. Oh, my! This must be the old man's study. Adams. My name is Armstrong. Do not correct me, Adams, I am your boss, Lewis Findley! Yes, sir. I want you to buy me Seville. The whole city? The whole city! Very well. Done and done. And what should we do with your new city, sir? Burn it to the ground. It is a place where dreams go to die. Perhaps... there is something else to be done. Because I know of a girl who lives there, who is beautiful and kind. Maybe we can give her the city, so she can care for its people in the manner they deserve. Hmm. - Oh, my Lord. - Mm. Look at that. It's beautiful. It's, uh, it's called a "katar." - Hmm. - It's an ancient Tamil weapon. Hmm. Stunning, isn't it? Yes. Uh, right. After you, sir. Oh, why, thank you. The man shows up at his hearing with one shoe. Well, I-I take one look at him and I realize that this is an opportunity to get the case thrown out. So, I tell the judge, "Take a look at his feet." I-I-- You know, I literally hold the man's foot up-- - Shoe up and put-- - Come on, offer him water. Oh! Oh, my goodness, I'm terribly sorry, sir! Oh... It's, uh... quite all right, dear. Now, um, where was I? Uh, Katherine was it? Would you care to tell us a bit about yourself? - No... - Or your time working for Mr. Findley? Oh, thank Christ. Um... um... Oh, well, they can share, too. What a wonderful idea. Please share, Katherine. Yeah, Katherine, share. I wanna hear how he treats his people. Hopefully better than you treated this pork loin. Mister-- Lord Findley is kind to us. He treats us like family. Was it something I said? Was that you? Screaming? No. What is going on? It's probably nothing. Stay in your room while I check it out. What are you doing here? Same thing as you. Trying to figure out what's going on here. Huh, Gordon. I was setting for an explanation for the power loss. Please, follow me. Ladies and gentlemen, there is no cause for alarm. Well, why did the power go out? It appears the main switch was flipped, but there is no reason for alarm. There is no one else on the island, I assure you. It was likely an animal. Regardless, I have fixed it, so there'll be no more trouble or incidents tonight. Now, if you'll please retire to your rooms. Hm. Miss Green, if you please. Gordon, has there been any construction in this hallway recently? Not that I know of, why do you ask? When the power went out, I heard a woman scream. Well, your room is not far from Miss Blanco. I should think she had quite a start. You said the rooms were soundproof. I suppose her window was open. Now, there'll be no more questions. Would you please return to your quarters? I won't leave the hall, but I don't feel like going back in there yet. Very good, miss. - You, too. - Good morning. Good morning. Ah... I was about to go for a walk, it's a lovely day out. Oh. Oh, God, yeah. I was actually just about to go for a walk, if you'd care to join me. Or if you prefer to stay. Uh, yeah, I'm, uh, not much of a breakfast guy. More of a coffee and cigarettes for me. - Can we smoke in here? - I'm... not sure. Right. Well, shall we? Please. So, what's your deal? I'm a florist from London. No, that's what you do, or at least what you say you do. What's your deal? I've been watchin' you. You're smart. Not like that putz doctor, the real kind. I see the things other people miss. No, it's more than that. You put things together in a way I've never seen before. At least not from a civilian. And yet that's all I am. Well, why not put your detective skills to better use? Oh, it's just not a fitting profession for a lady. There's not a place at Scotland Yard for me. So, go private. You know, I knew a lady gumshoe in California. She couldn't have been more than 20 years old. Pretty little slip of a thing, too. She was the best I've ever seen. I should like to have your experiences, Mr. Walker. Trust me, you... you don't want those. Speaking of experiences, is it true you killed a man? You know, I thought you'd have gotten to that sooner. Yeah, it's true. Look, I'm not proud of it. What happened? He was a, uh... he was a hotshot boxing promoter out of Boston, and I was doin' a story on the Irish mob and their connections around the city. One night... One night, I see him, and he's with his wife... and he starts beatin' on her, somethin' fierce. And then he slipped, hit his head. Cost me a hell of a story, he would have killed her. I remember that story. Of course you do. You were let off because none of the witnesses would come forward. Yeah, well, like I said, he slipped and hit his head, ten or so times. I think you're not the terrifying brute you try to present. Still, I would like to avoid such situations. Listen, you gotta get down into the muck if you wanna find the truth. You can't have any fear or limits to what you'll do to find your answers. What I said to you yesterday, that-that wasn't a threat. Then what was it? Call it a "professional courtesy." Guys like Findley, they-they got secrets they won't hesitate to protect. You don't care for our host, do you? I've never met the man. Ah, just when I thought you were starting to show me a little respect. You know, the comments, the rants... you have an issue with Lewis Findley that doesn't even require his presence. You caught me. Then why come? Same as you. I-I've got questions. I think we may not find many answers. Maybe not. But guys like Findley, they don't do anything without an angle. Hopefully, I can at least figure that out. I know it has something to do with us, but... Yeah. Me neither. Hmm. You know, yesterday, I didn't mean to-- Look! What the hell? There's one extra rabbit. Jesus. And? Oh, no, you don't. No, you're not doin' that again. You can't dumb me up now. You know somethin', I wanna hear what it is. You're gonna tell me. Where are you going? Come on! Unbelievable. Alright, what the hell is this? I think it means there's someone here who doesn't belong. Yeah, well, I got my guess. Oh, she doesn't know anything. At least I don't think she does. Explain that. Well, she could just as easily be one of the five. All this does is confirm that there's someone here who's not who they say they are. It's games on top of games, on top of games. And we're going to have to play them all. How may I help you, Mr. Armstrong? I think you can call me "Phillip" at this point. Oh, no, I am just a poor waitress and you a successful doctor. I know my place, Mr. Armstrong. I'm hardly rich. Hmm, you belong in this house more so than I do, no? Now, chip-chop, what is it that you are bothering me for? I was just about to take a little nap before lunch. It's, um, it's "chop-chop," not "chip-chop." Ah, so you've come to insult my English. Well, if that is all, I'd like to take my siesta now. Right. I think I'll have a walk. Yes, I'll have a walk. Alright, trust me. This is a bit strange. If he shows up, I'll eat a bug. Alright, what's going on here? Last night, you couldn't get enough to eat or drink, and now you're sharing secrets and barely eating, hmm? I'm afraid I have some bad news. Lord Findley is still grounded and weather conditions have not improved as expected. As a result, he will not be joining us today. Huh! What the bloody hell are you doing? Whatever I want, Larry. Findley's not here to stop me, is he? You're mad. He's mad. Something's happened. What's goin' on? - Is that-- - It's Lawrence. Kane. Kane. - Oh, my God. - How? Well, gee, let me guess. He was stabbed. Kid, go and get the help. Why put the knife in the tree? Maybe it was a message. Who could do such a thing? Someone very determined. And someone very strong. Miranda, where are you-- Oh, hell. You gonna swim for it? You know, you don't strike me as the type of person to go sightseeing while the rest of us get hunted. This is a nightmare. The rabbits. I saw. What do we do? Use this, sweetheart. It's not enough, Donald. Yeah, well, the world's full of disappointments. Look, I've been around. One thing I've learned is you do what you gotta do with what you got. What if I can't? Well, then we probably all die. We should gather in the lounge. Is that really a good idea? Yes, and it wasn't a request. Follow. Let me try once more from the top. Phillip and Carmen were in the east wing hall, Lu was in her room, I was in the study, Donald was outside, and the staff is still all unaccounted for during the period where the late Mr. Kane was being brutally murdered. As such, I have concluded that we must treat everyone, myself included, as a suspect. - Now, hold on a second. You-- - No one has a valid alibi, it is the only logical starting point. Phillip and I already said that we were together in the hall. Did anyone else verify this encounter? I'm sorry. Is our word no good? Given the fondness you two have for one another, it is equally as plausible you would cover for each other as it is that you were together in the east wing hall. Huh, she's got you there, kiddies. And what of you and the Yank? Don't think we haven't all witnessed your conspiring? Which is why Mr. Walker is atop my list of suspects. Wait, what? You ungrateful-- You were the closest to the body. You are also the most physically able to overpower Lawrence. I barely knew the guy! Exactly. We barely know each other, and you barely knew the deceased. We must try to figure out what connects us to understand who has a true motive. Right now, this is just conjecture and baseless speculation. It would help if we knew anything about the late Mr. Kane as a start, anything at all. - Sean? - Ma'am. Can you go look at the body? Check his pockets. See if there's anything that might help us know him a little better. Yes, of course, ma'am. Wait, someone should go with him. - I'll accompany Sean. - Thank you, sir. Maybe someone not on the staff. I will go. Thank you, my dear. Well, alright. Now, sweetheart, this should be good. What's the baseless speculation about you? Ah, a delightful exercise. Well, I found the deceased boorish. And I was the last person in the study, where the dagger resided on Findley's desk. Right now, we all have conceivable opportunity and equally likely motives, which is why we can't rule anyone out. Including you. Miss Green, I hardly think that's an appropriate accusation. If we know little about each other, we know even less about them. And it was one of us killed! We mustn't resort to tribal suspicions. I am merely asserting that anyone of us can be a suspect until we can gather more information and begin ruling individuals out. - The body is gone! - What? Mr. Kane's body is missing. I think we all understood the first time, but just to reiterate, what? Bodies do not just get up and walk away. No, dear, they do not. And I know from experience. I need to see this for myself. Okay. What did you do? What's going on? Is the body there or not? - No. - That's impossible. Not if she and the old man moved it. Why and how would I accomplish that, Mr. Walker? One mystery at a time. I still think they had something to do with it. We must watch our insinuations and accusations. Oh, now, we should watch our insinuations? I'd like to know where all of you were at the time Kane was killed, and it would be in your best interest to tell us now. - Is that a threat, sir? - I don't know, Jeeves, is it? Now, hold on, this is ridiculous. We must not to let our emotions get the best of us. May I make a suggestion? You haven't needed permission thus far. Why don't we take to our rooms until dinner? It's 5:00 now, that's two and a half hours. That's plenty of time for tempers to subside and then we can start a conversation that's based on facts and provable truths. What about us? Who is supposed to prepare the meal? I don't feel safe in the kitchen alone. Why don't we take heed to travel in pairs or groups? - This is a good idea. - Fine by me. Lock your doors! I need a drink. Refreshments can be brought up, sir. - Yeah, I got it. Thanks. - Of course. My dear, shall we? Well, that was a mistake. I don't remember you asking for my loyalty. And, more importantly, I don't remember giving you mine. Yeah, well, now you got no one to watch your back, sweetheart. When the others lock their doors, please come to my room. I don't wanna be alone. Of course, but we must be careful until we get off this island. Come on. I'm so scared. Findley will be here in the morning, and we'll get to the bottom of all this. There's nothing to fear. And what of us? We can leave and be together. You can visit me in London. London is dreary. Then I shall come to Seville. I hate Seville. Then we can go anywhere in the world that you desire. And if you can't pick one place, we'll go everywhere. It doesn't matter so long as we're together. What a beautiful dream. Then let's make it real. Sometimes I forget how young you are, how simple your life has been. What does that mean? Nothing, darling. Tell me more about your beautiful dream. What's wrong? It will all be over soon. Everything is going as anticipated. Hmm. What? What? No. No! No! No! No! Where's Sean? Probably puttering about somewhere. No, he's supposed to be here. This man is dead. Take the body to the lounge. Every contact leaves a trace. - Oh, that's odd. - What? To whom does this belong? - Miss Wang, please follow me. - Where are we going? You'll be spending the rest of the night locked in your room, and in the morning you'll be turned over to the proper authorities. I did not kill this man! Miss Wang, don't make this any harder than it needs to be! This is outrageous! Why would I kill this man? How would I kill him? Sean was an old man. The killer did incapacitate him by knocking him with the door. It's not outside the realm of possibility. That's it, come along. No, wait! I'll be back in less than an hour. Do not lock this woman up yet, or I'll have you arrested for false imprisonment. Thought so. Wait! Where are you going? She's deranged. Nothing new on that front. I don't understand how this is happening. I know, my dear. It's all very shocking. How can they just be dead? It's only been one day. One day and two men are just... dead. Dying ain't hard, sweetheart. Everybody does it. Meet Blunder. Findley's dog. Findley's dead dog. - Not quite. - Miss Green, what is the meaning of all this, and what does it have to do with the dog? I think we can drop that now. Everyone, meet Lewis Findley. What? How? Show, don't tell, Mr. Armstrong. See? Now, Gordon, be a dear and open your coat. It would be improper for a textile man to dress beneath his station. Says who? Lewis Findley, before he went underground in 1897. So, that's it? That's your big reveal? A coat? No, that's just a taste. Watch your step, careful now. Alright, you got us all packed in here. Now, what? Right, well, in the hour or so before dinner-- You mean when we were supposed to be cloistered. Oh, where's the fun in that, Mr. Walker? I took the liberty of taking a tour of the house without a guide. It really is an expansive property, full of nooks and crannies. Plenty of places to hide secrets. And that's when I came upon this room. Now, I don't know if you've noticed, but there are no photographs or portraits in the house. Lewis Findley was apparently a recluse of the highest order, who abhorred having his likeness taken in any way. I'm sure that's what sparked your interest, right, Mr. Walker? Um, yeah. Yeah, 'cause the old man, he was always using an interme... intermediary. You. I knew-- I knew you from somewhere. This guy-- you were his stand in at the meeting with Carnegie in New York, weren't you? Which time? Mr. Carnegie was very fond of his little events. There was always a banquet or a dedication that we mustn't miss. This is getting a bit off topic. There'll be time enough for that later. At the moment, we must continue with the task at hand. His perceived aversion to photographs was not entirely accurate. Wow, the old man really liked the mutt. Which is why he hid Blunder in a small, though surprisingly comfortable shack on the northernmost point of the island. I saw it on my way to the cliffs. Poor Blunder, he just couldn't uphold the ruse. And that brings me to my last surprise. If you'll all follow me to the lounge. This behavior seems a bit ghoulish given the circumstances. I rather like it. Gettin' a little sick of your games, old man. Alright, all settled? This better be good, sweetheart. Miranda, please, there have been two murders. We are very afraid. No, you're right. I have been a bit glib. The truth is a man has died, and it's a somber occasion, traumatic even. But you are wrong on one count. You may come in. Hello all. Uh, terribly sorry about the morbid theatrics. - I'm gonna kill you, you no good son-- - Oh! - No, no, no, no, no, no, no! - Let go! - Mr. Walker. - No, no! What a big, twisted-- damn you-- I got it, I'm fine. I'm fine. Alright, let go. Alright. But you're gonna answer some questions if you wanna get off this island alive. That is, uh, more than fair, all being all things considered, but if you'll allow me to explain, you may find that I am not completely deserving of execution. Would anyone else care for one before we begin? Yeah. I'll have one. Right, on with the show. Many months ago I was approached by Lord Findley here with a rather strange proposition and an even stranger scheme. Lord Findley valued his privacy above nearly all else, that much is true. He never took a family, but that is not to suggest he didn't seek intimate companionship in his day. In point of fact, Mr. Findley was a bit of a lothario, and believed himself to have sired a number of children, all of whom could serve as his heirs when the time came. And the hour was approaching fast. Lord Findley was unwilling, however, to turn his immense fortune over to a complete stranger, much less so to, as he put it, an undeserving lout. The man really seemed most invested in what would happen to his holdings and his business. He made it very clear, "One heir". To the rest, well... phew. So, off I went. Five children deemed most fit to inherit the immense fortune. Five invitations. But that was only the beginning, for how was Findley to choose? Give the old man credit for creativity. He hired a pair of actors, that he used from time to time as surrogates, to play his staff alongside himself, as he would adopt the role of the venerable butler Sean. But how to provoke a person, to reveal their true nature in but a short weekend, which Findley insisted was all he needed to choose an heir? I suppose a murder was as good a way as any. The rest, the lights, and such, were all meant to invoke tension and unease. And the rabbits? Rabbits? In the woods, there's a small shack with five live rabbits, one dead. They looked to represent us. Oh, I believe they were just meant as fresh meat for the dog. Sorry it isn't a saucier reason, my dear. My employer was eccentric, not insane. Yeah, I don't see the difference. He wanted to test you. This, however, wasn't part of the plan. Lord Findley had fully intended to reveal his selection tomorrow. I'm sorry, I truly am. Where are Gordon and Katherine? Who cares? They can't leave. About that. Hurry, dear! I'm trying! We must launch! Let him up, we'll come quietly! Oh, do something! - He's going to kill him! - Donald! Where were you going, huh? Donald, let him up right now, or I'll make sure you spend the rest of your life in jail! Why run? Look, miss, it was a gig, and a bloody good one at that, huh? Findley was a bit of an odd fellow, bit cold as well, but he took care of us, paid us well. We're not exactly West End regulars. Acting gigs in London, not exactly stable work, and we're not exactly spring chickens. This isn't where we thought we would end up, playing his staff, being his emissaries. But it's been so hard. We've been married for 15 years and what do we have to show for it? No children, nary a leading role between us, but these past few years, working for Mr. Findley allowed us to buy a house and start-- You're not answering the question. Yeah, because they don't have an answer to the question, 'cause they killed the old man. Trust me, I've seen plenty of guilty people, and these two are guilty as sin. We didn't kill him! Look, let me explain. This gig was different. Findley was very clear that we should make no mistakes. He needed us to get the absolute most out of each of you. We needed to poke, and prod, and instigate as much as possible without givin' up the game. And he was always there. It was a lot of pressure. And then when the old man turned up dead-- You panicked. How were we going to keep the house without... Oh, I'm sorry. You found and lost a father today. It hardly compares. My father is Shen Wang, and he is alive and well in China. Lewis Findley may have known my mother, but he was not my father. Nor was he a father to any of us. Not a real father, anyway. Thank you. Yeah, I don't buy it. So-so, let me get this straight. The old man croaks, and the two of you decide to take off in the boat, leave us stuck here on the island, all 'cause you got panicked, huh? I don't buy it. Not one bit. I haven't forgot about you either, missy. You've been skulkin' around the house since you got here like you got somethin' to hide. And all of a sudden, out of the blue, your scarf turns up wrapped around a dead guy's neck! This is outlandish! Miss Green, talk some sense into him. It is hard to understand why you would come all the way from China on little more than an invitation. There you go. Thank you. You're not off the hook either, sweetheart. You're always walkin' around, readin' your little mystery books. Dreamin' of becomin' a real detective one day. Then your dreams come true and you get to solve a real murder. Maybe you thought the only thing better than solvin' one murder is solvin' two, huh? Maybe that meant enough for you to kill the old man yourself. Alright, this is a reasonable enough theory. But there's more connecting you to the murder. - Like what? - You despise the trappings of wealth, and we've already seen the ferocity of your rage. Oh, there it is. Soon as chips are down, you come after me every time. This is getting ridiculous. We know that someone killed Mr. Findley. The impostors are suspects, as well as Mr. Walker, Miss Green, and Miss Wang, but we are talking in circles. I'd say that list is a bit short, don't you? What are you implying, Mr. Kane? I could never harm anyone. Phillip, tell them. It's unlikely. But you would do anything to avoid returning to Seville. And what of you? Are you not above suspicion? That's outrageous! I am a doctor. My job is to help and heal. As though no doctor has ever committed nefarious deeds? What of your Jack the Ripper? Are there no theories that he is a doctor? One baseless theory implicates all doctors. Brilliant. Well done. - What about H.H. Holmes? - And Hawley Crippen. Burke and Hare sold bodies to medical schools. Bodies that they stole and murdered. Morality lessons from a lawyer, and a lawyer that took part in this charade no less. That's very rich coming from you, old boy. I suppose this was inevitable. But since we're all passing blame around tonight, humor me, why would I kill my employer, hmm? Maybe because you're the only one with access to the will. - What? - If you could add one of us, you could just as easily add yourself. You wouldn't even have to take the whole fortune. You could just carve off a little piece of the estate for yourself. Well, considering I currently don't have access to the will, I'd say that's a faulty theory. How dare you? You are the lawyer! Enough! This isn't getting us anywhere. We need to rest. We'll call the police. They will handle this in the morning. Good idea. What? I need you to come with me. I think that would be a bit daft given the circumstances. Wouldn't you agree, whatever your name is? Still Gordon. That much is true. If I wanted you dead, I could force my way in. I need to show you something. And why would I want to see it? Because I think you can find the killer. You know, you had me worried when we first met. Yeah, you seemed very skilled at detecting a lie. But I suppose we all have our parts to play. And there's only one thing left to do at this point. Where is Miranda? Where's Gordon? He left in the night. He said he had to take care of something in the study. Oh, no. Friends! Or should I say brothers and sisters? Where's my husband? He's preparing the boat for our departure. He took it a few hours ago to fetch Detective Church here. Detective Harold Church, Dartmouth constabulary. Pleasure. We have much to discuss. There's a murderer in our midst. Aren't you being a little cavalier? No reason for alarm, sir. Alright then, shall we? It is me. I can't be older than 14 here. He was watching us all this time. That's just the tip of the iceberg, I'm afraid. Gordon and Katherine weren't lying when they said they were keeping an eye on us. So, what in the hell am I lookin' at? Cameras, and expensive ones at that. Completely state-of-the-art, in every room, with this nifty little feature that logs footage - and replays it. - Impossible. Findley had connections with both the American and British military, very high up. One day the whole apparatus just showed up with some very serious-looking men in uniform. He showed me how to operate it, but he never said where he obtained such technology. I first suspected something was off when I could hear Carmen scream through the walls. Even if the claims of soundproofing were a lie meant to scare, a house as sturdy as this should dampen the sound a bit better, but Findley had a whole network of hallways behind these walls. So, you saw the killer? This is ridiculous. I'm leavin'. I'm afraid I can't let you do that, my good man. I'm sure you understand. The surveillance yielded a treasure trove of information, but I'm sure you'd all like some context. You know, working with roses, one becomes desensitized to such wounds, which I'm sure is something that you have experienced, Mr. Kane. Hazards of the job. And, Findley insisted on rehearsing multiple scenarios before choosing exactly how I was to be murdered. Your father's hands weren't terribly steady. How could he treat his friends so poorly? Men that rich don't mix with staff. I should take offense, but spot on, old boy. As I'm sure you know our father was quite the traveler, and he made sure to document his adventures, even his dalliances. Liu Chan. My mother. Esme Blanco. And mine. Please don't. Naturally, my mother was here. But one name was missing. No Walkers, no Americans, nothing of the sort. But there was one name that appears again and again: Shelby. She was the first, a maid who worked on the estate, and apparently she left quite an impact on Findley. The first few pages are documented meticulously, and with a romantic fervor that Findley seemed unable to access for anything else in his life. Shelby and her child. For you see, the maid had a child, a boy. Detective, will you check his breast pocket? Steady now, big fellow. Yes. Shelby Walker and Lewis Findley. I'm afraid this doesn't prove much. Just wait. He said he'd marry her. Over and over and over. So, she waited, and waited for him to tell his parents. She was young, she had time. But then she got pregnant... and that changed everything. Said he had no choice but to fire her. And she got-- she got nothing... because payouts raise questions. So, she had-- she had nowhere to go. Her own family wouldn't let her in, because she was unmarried and carrying a... a bastard son. So, she moved to the States. She had me on the boat. She always clung to this hope that... that one-day Findley would come for her. We would live in the lap of luxury. She refused to find any permanent work, because she was sure that any day now, her prince would come. She'd say, "Daddy will come save us." Daddy. Then she got sick. So sick that she swallowed her pride and she... she wrote Findley a letter, begging for help. Not a word. And she made sure that I knew the truth about Findley before she died. And when her day came... that was there that I vowed that... I would come after Findley and everyone like him for the rest of my life. See, the rich and powerful, they know that information can do more harm than any-any knife or pistol. So, I became a hunter of secrets. I would find their sins and I would drag 'em out into the cold light of day for everyone to see. He watched your every move. Those... those are my stories. It's all in the journal. He was terribly proud of you. He didn't care much for your politics, but your drive, your relentlessness. You were everything he wanted in an heir, 'cause you were just like him. I was nothing like him! I mean, look around. He just left us all to struggle and survive, while he watched us from his gilded towers. And at any time, he could have eased our suffering, but, nope. He has let us twist in the wind. And then when that time came in his life to do the right thing and let us in... more games. So, I did the one thing that that man, that-- that coward didn't have the decency to do. I stopped the game. By killing him? By doing what was necessary. By framing me. By blaming Gordon, then Miranda, and when that didn't work, making sure we blamed one another, so that you could slip away. You are the real coward! Well... I guess I got a bit of the old man in me after all. But y'all should be thanking me. I set you free. That money is cursed. For four of us, there is the utter degradation of being told to our face by Findley that we're just not good enough. And then for the one lucky winner... it's a worse fate to be locked in a cage and turned into a cheap facsimile of him. That's not exactly true. This was never a game of choosing. This was due diligence. It was always going to be you, Donald. This was just a test to vet you. We were never serious options. And now, it will be no one. The inheritance should be divided equally amongst his children. Is that not the law? Possibly, but the will was very specific that should an heir not be chosen, all assets would be returned to Findley Industries and a successor be appointed by the board. If an heir were chosen, however, all would be well taken care of. Though you'd be forced to relinquish your names, sworn to secrecy under threat of losing your buyouts. Games on top of games. Take him away, Detective. I'm terribly sorry. Had I known the depths of his sadism, I never would have partook. He would have found someone else. Our father does not define our worth, nor does our station. We are the masters of our own fate. - We don't need him. - Or his money. Because we have each other. What's going to happen to him? It should be an open and shut case. He'll spend the rest of his life in a cell. What a waste. Oh, you're too kind. And that's why you'll never be a detective, sweetheart. That compassion is why I caught you, and it's why I'll catch more like you. And don't call me "sweetheart." Be seein' you, sis. Miss, wait. You've got a gift for this. If you ever need a hand getting started, I have mates at Scotland Yard. Oh, thank you. But I think my services are better utilized on my own. Oh, like a private detective? Uh, the money-- Oh, I've never had much use for money, but I would like to be of service to people who truly need it. Still, I'll take this. Even a good detective needs help from time to time. Right you are, miss. And I'll make sure the world knows that the woman who found Lewis Findley's killer is open for business. Thank you, sir. I was thinking about us. As was I. Just because we can't be together, doesn't mean we can't be in each other's lives. I've never had a little brother before. I'm not that young. Darling, it's a joke. I suppose he abandoned you, too. Well, why don't you join our collection of lost things? We need to look out for each other.
