Opening 14! My name is Eve Duncan. Your lawyer told me you might be willing to talk about where the bodies are buried. Is that blood? No, it's paint, or... ...Clay, what? Don't know which. You're the artist? Please, mr Fraser, what? Can live with this if you can just help me bring my little girl home. Which one was yours? My daughter was Bonnie. She had red hair, and a beautiful smile. She was ten years old. Doesn't matter where she's buried. She's gone. Guard! Please, just tell me where she is. Tell me where she is. Tell me where she is! I'll be dead in four hours. Come ask me in hell. Buzzer Time for break! My lunch is coming. Your loss. All right. Thank you. Ron's coming over tonight for dinner, care to join US? Are you cooking, or did Ron finally learn the truth? Takeout is perfectly satisfying if it's followed by great sex! Mom! Please. I'm eating. She looks young. Yeah. Early 20s. Her skull was crushed from the anterior parietal. You mean someone beat the crap out of her? Yeah. Joe says she was found in a landfill, doesn't sound like an accident to me. Afternoon, ladies. Speak of the devil. Chicken burrito, no beans, extra green sauce. Excellent. Look at that sweet face. What? Bet she never knew what hit her. Did you bring the photos? Yeah. All right, this is her. Tracy Williams. What? Thought it might be. Her eyes are Hazel. What? What? Got a call from spiro on the way over. The FBI found bodies buried at Talladega. How fresh? Any children? There's no way to tell how long they've been there, but five adults and one young girl. On site or at the morgue? Eve, it's not going to be that easy. There's a lot of jurisdictional red tape with this. The Talladega pd is pissed off that the FBI's taken over this case. Local pd will lose that fight, and the FBI will be thrilled to see me. Site or morgue? Morgue. I'll drive. Get a load of that smell? Hello, mr grundard. Call me Mark. So, what did they find? What? Don't know. They wheeled in a small one. Look, what? Know your daughter was never found. Any chance it's a personal visit for you? What? Am not your next headline. What? Know, but if you could just fill in some blanks, that'd be great. Hey! Did you not hear what she said? I'll take that as a no comment. If you ever want to talk, give me a call. We haven't been this busy since we got Katrina's overflow. Have you determined her age? The she part is about all I've had time to determine. What? Know she was in here. Maybe somebody moved her. Gordon! What's this? "Dig deeper"? Do you know who they are? These are two of Robert Fraser's victims we never found. But Fraser's dead, we saw him die. So, who wrote this note? Someone who knows you'd come running. There are more bodies out there. What? Studied your work on the MacMillan case at Quantico. There was this mob hit in Chicago, the guy was burned to a crisp in an airport parking lot. No face, no fingerprints. Miss Duncan's reconstruction was so good, O'Hare's security facial recognition software ID'd the guy. 14 matching signifiers. What? Remember the case. Did you find any children? We were ready to call it quits until we found two more. Just over here. Young. Techs are redlining it but the rocks are really screwing US. Excuse my language, miss Duncan. It's Eve. And, you're right. The rocks are really screwing US. Joe, how the hell did you know there were more? Someone took the girl's bones. What?! Left US a note to keep digging. How the hell...? Get me rawling and dupree, now. Do you know Eve Duncan? By reputation only. It's nice to meet you, miss Duncan. Preteen males, both exhibit similar extreme brachymetatarsia, so they're probably related. I'm Robert spiro. Sorry! Agent in charge, you already met Charlie cather. You should tell me about this note. It was addressed to Eve, came with two photos of Sam and Mike joyner. We think that's who these two are. So, we may have found another one of Robert Fraser's dump sites. Well, give me one of these boys and what? Could tell you for sure. What? Heard that you had an eight month wait list for your services. What? Work for myself. Looks like you move to the top of the list. Whoever did this, I'm sorry you met him. 'This is detective Joe Quinn. Leave a message and I'll return it.' hey, Joe, it's Eve. What? Finished the reconstruction. Give me a call back when you can come take a look. Phone rings - hey. - Hello, Eve. Did the boys tell you what they know? The ones they pulled from the mud at Talladega? Who is this? You can call me dom. And did you steal the girl's bones from the morgue, dom? The girl. You're wondering if it's your body. What a free spirit she was. All that curly red hair. Chocolate ice cream stains. What? Know your sick type and you don't scare me. The man who killed my daughter is dead and you can't take me there again. Eve, the places I'm going to take you. We're going to become very close, you and what?. Look outside. Warmer. You're getting warmer. What is it? A brown paper package that's tied up with string. It's one of my favourite things. Go on, open it. God made Eve from Adam's rib. You've got the Clay and you've got the skill. Don't you wish you could make Bonnie again? Anything? No trace of him. You ok? Yeah. You know, this guy could be some nut messing with your head. Annoying, but harmless. He came to her house, that's not harmless. What about the rib bone? If someone stole the Talladega bones from the morgue... This isn't that rib bone. Look at the colouration. Even without running the mass spectrometry, what? Know that this bone has been out of the earth for months. Maybe years. So, we know he got a rib somewhere. We're not going to know anything definitive until we run the DNA. Do we have a sample from Bonnie? Of course! I'm sorry. It's in the database. Ok. Let's focus on this. There's no doubt this is Mike joyner, right? One of Fraser's victims. He knew about the ice cream. That information was never released. Fraser was on death row for three years, he liked to talk. I'll go back, I'll look at the visitor logs. Maybe he had a partner. No. We hunted him for seven months, what? Know everything there is to know about this guy. He worked alone. Maybe a sick fan, a copycat? Someone's doing this. Well, someone needs to protect me and my daughter. We will give you 24-hour protection. We'll also run a trace on the line, just in case he calls again. He'll call. What? Have a feeling this is just the beginning. You interest him. You can profile this guy all you want, but Eve is not bait. If this is my daughter's rib, if dom knows where she is... ...I'm going to catch him. \ let US do our jobs, miss Duncan. I. Dom might be all talk, we just don't know yet. She gasps Eve. What are you doing? Your tech people took photos of the young girl's bones before moving them. So, I'm using the measurements to extrapolate her approximate age. Isn't that how you caught kaelin? First of all, what? Did not catch Tom kaelin, Seattle pd did. Second of all, my work just gave them probable cause to search. Charlie, have you really read all my books? Yeah. Of course. You want to be an FBI profiler, you've got to do your homework. What? Mean, forensic tech comes easy for me, but the intuitive stuff, not so much. And that's what you think you'll learn by bird-dogging spiro? He's the best profiler in the bureau, just like you're the best forensics sculptor in the country. Ok. And what does your intuition tell you about dom? Erm, as far as we know, Fraser only killed children, right? So, why were there five adult bodies found at Talladega? Either Fraser was killing adults too, which is highly unlikely, or someone else was dumping bodies there. This morning, the FBI lab found traces of candle wax residue on the right hands of the adult bodies. A signature? It's not Fraser's calling card. So, you think dom might be the candle wax killer? What does spiro think? He told me to run with it, with that superior smile of his, which usually means it's not worth pursuing, so... You're going to pursue it anyway? Of course! Phone rings hello. She's back. What? Bonnie's back. You mean the rib bone? Eve, please, I'm not talking about creation. Well, not exactly. Do you believe in reincarnation? I'm hanging up. No, you're not. Agent spiro has told you to keep me on the line as long as you can and detective Quinn is running the trace as we speak, so I'll be brief. Your daughter's Clay may be gone, but I'm convinced her spirit is alive and well in another little ten-year-old girl. Another redhead. Can you hear how insane you sound? I've seen her. She's had a rough life this time around. Four foster homes in four years. You don't have to believe. Just know she's close. And her name is Jane. Why are you telling me this? Because I'm going to kill her. Phone beeps What happened with the phone trace? He's using the Internet to call. Probably an overseas server. He's going to change it up every time, we're not going to catch him that way. You don't think dom actually believes in this reincarnation bit, do you? No, what? Don't. Mysticism doesn't seem like part of his targeting profile. That part's for me. He wants to give me a new Bonnie to care about. We don't even know that this girl exists. She does. Somewhere in this city is a ten-year-old foster child with red hair, named Jane. Eve, this doesn't have anything to do with you. Doesn't it? He already knows how to make me jump. I'm a forensic sculptor who lives to bring lost souls home. To put ghosts to rest. And now he's giving me a lost child who's fresh and blood, not just bones. Eve, why don't you let US take it from here? Ok, fine. I'm not letting an innocent kid get hurt some dom can have his thrills. But you'll let me go to prison hacking into the child services database? Who said hacking? You're a detective with the Atlanta pd, following a lead. Wait, go back, go back. That's got to be her. Jane mcguire, ten years old. Four foster homes, red hair, Hazel eyes. She doesn't look like Bonnie. She looks kind of mean. She looks like she could kick your butt. It says she's living with a woman named fay sugarton. 2054, Luther. Whoa, that's our old neighbourhood! Let's go. No. Hold on! Charlie's going to be here for his shift in a few minutes. I'll make tea. We'll go in the morning. Look, what? Want you to try and rest, ok? Get some sleep. All right? I'm making this my top priority. I'm going to catch this guy, even if it costs me my job. You could always get a job doing this. What? Only do this for you. Hey! Goodnight. Goodnight. Charlie. Hey, Charlie. What? Found something and I'd like your feedback before what? Give it to spiro. A female body found in 1981. Never ID'd, waxy substance on the hand. Where's San Luz? It's a suburb of flagstaff, Arizona. Are you asking me to do a reconstruction? No. The body was cremated, but there may be a DNA sample on file. Do is think it's worth pursuing? What? Don't know. Maybe they're related. The medical examiner didn't test the waxy substance, it could have been candle wax. It might have been adipocere, a result of natural decomposition. Well, keep the file, just in case. What? Have copies. You're good at this. Don't give up. Thanks. Jane's had her share of problems but no-one is trying to kill her. Trust me, it's nothing she brought on himself, but the threat this man represents is very real. Then bring me a court order. Or send this FBI agent you mentioned. Agent spiro is at a crime scene in Talladega. Jane's in danger now. It's taken me a long time to build up some trust with Jane. You can't just pull her out of her home. Miss sugarton, please. Look, would it be all right if we post an agent, just to keep an eye on her? All right. She attends Crawford middle school on 13th street. Lets out at three, she walks the eight blocks home from there. Are you going to tell her she's in danger? She needs to be wary. She laughs Jane was born wary. Don't you talk to her, don't scare her, or I'll make you regret it. Hard to believe you grew up here. It wasn't so bad. When you're a kid, you don't know any better. That's her. Eve, fay does not want US talking to her. We scared her. She screams ok, ok. Calm down! Stop, stop! Why'd you do it? Child services is on the way. Is there anyone else what? Can call? Here, let me... Can what? Help you with that? You two were at the door, like you knew this was going to happen. Do you know who did this? Not exactly. Don't lie to me. Ok. He calls himself dom. And he picked you at random, sort of, but... ...l am part of the reason he did this. There's a reason? It's an insane one, but... ...l guess in his head, there is. What? Should have been here. There's nothing you could have done. What? Know you loved fay. What? Didn't love her. But she treated me decent. She didn't deserve to get killed. No. No, she didn't. How's the kid? She's pretty shaken up, but she's tough. Yeah, that's what my arm tells me! Child services and is taking her but they clearly don't understand the danger. Well, I'll make sure that they do. But what? Need you to go home and stay there, Eve. Today was too close. You promised to see this through. Yeah, me, not you. What, are you locking me up? No, I'm keeping you safe. I'm going to be here pretty late tonight. I've got Charlie coming to pick you up and take you home. Ok, fine. Do your thing. Phone rings hello. So, what do you think of our little janey? Why would you kill fay? Jane couldn't bond with you while mama bear was around, she had to go. And you have to get Jane back. What? Couldn't get to her if what? Tried. You'll do more than try. You have 24 hours. What? Know where they took her. What? Don't know what you're talking about. Look, what? Don't know why the girl's important but what? Can sense a good story when I'm standing next to it. Where did they take her? Family services holding facility, very discreet, very secure. Yeah, but they told you. What? Have my ways. So, what's the deal? You lead me there and what? Give you the story? Sounds fair to me. Do you have a car? Yeah, right over here. Let's go before my protective custody shows up. Engine revs Ls this the safe house? Yeah, this is where they're holding her. Phone rings so, what does this kid have to do with the Talladega kills? Nothing. Ok. Any idea where they've got her? Back bedroom. What? Know there's a connection somewhere. Help me get her out and I'll tell you everything what? Know. No, thanks. What? Draw the line at felony kidnapping. Well, then there goes your story. Jane, Jane! Jane! Wait! Whoa, whoa! Lose something? Hey, Jane. Wait! We want to help. We want to help. Well, you haven't been helping so far. Look, Mark is a friend. Come with US, we want to keep you safe. Well, what? Guess you have a car? Yeah. What? Was leaving anyway. Phone rings so, what is that? Like, the tenth time he's called? Maybe you should fess up. - Hello? - Eve, are you ok? Where the hell are you? I'm sorry, what? Had to meet someone. There is a psycho out there after you and you just disappear without telling me? What? Thought you were dead. What? Didn't mean to scare you. Look, dom has taken Jane from the holding facility. We're mobilising all the agencies. What? Have Jane with me. What? Dom called. And he said if what? Didn't get Jane out of there within 24 hours, he would kill her. Why didn't you tell me what you were going to do? Because you're Atlanta pd. Kidnapping's a little more serious than hacking a database. You told me what? Had to stay safe at home. That is not what what? Meant, you know it. How did you even know where she was? What? Had help. Listen, I'm sorry if I'm improvising a bit, but she was in danger. Just tell spiro and your boss that Jane is safe. Maybe we can still fix this. You bring her back tonight, you may not do any jail time. I'm sorry, what? Just... What? Can't. Eve! Is that the guy what? Hit? Yeah. His name's Joe. Is he your boyfriend? That... No. That's none of your business. If you're fighting because of me, it kind of is. We're not fighting. And I'm not the one who hit him with the bat. Whatever. Come on. Into bed. Are you serious? You're tucking me in? Where were you planning on going when Mark and what? Found you? What? Have friends. Weren't you scared? No. All right, goodnight. What? Did like her, you know. Fay? Yeah. She would sometimes buy me red velvet cupcakes. You know, fosters won't usually spend any extra on US. Yeah, she seemed real nice. Sleep tight. So, if what? Didn't get her out of there, he would have killed her. Are you serious? What? Couldn't make up a story like this. So, what are you going to do? I'm going to go after him. You're going to go after him? Ok. Are you sure the FBI can't track this phone? What? Disabled the GPS but what? Still think you should get rid of it. It's my only line to dom. He'll call me and want me to do something. You know, he thinks he's in charge. But he is so desperate for attention, for someone to listen, he'll make a mistake. You know, you're almost as confident as Jane. What? Don't know many adults that would manage as well as she has. Well, she grew up around bullets and addicts, you learn to keep your head down and not ask questions. Is that how you survived? Sorry. Reporter. What? Had a baby by the time what? Was 15. That leaves you with two options, welfare or crack whore. Ok. So, what did you do? What? Became an artist. But after Bonnie was murdered, anything what? Painted or sculpted just meant nothing to me. What? Learned about forensic sculpting while we were searching for her. What? Took a couple of classes and what?, you know, seem to have a knack for it. A knack? Come on, you're the best there is, you know that. All what? Know is that Jane needs someone on her side. Yeah. Well, her future's up to her, you just need to make sure she has one. Phone rings hello. Bravo on the jailbreak. You might as well stop. You can't get to Jane any more. But someone will get to you both. Your faces are all over the news. What? Could use a change of scenery. Maybe I'll go to flagstaff. Why would you do that? What? Think that's where you learned to kill. What? Don't like the past. But since you're going, I'll play along. What? Did kill in flagstaff a week ago. A sweet little suburban songbird. What's her name? What? Showed her the light and she sang for me. She sang for hours. The FBI will find her and then they'll find you. The FBI couldn't hold on to your daughter's bones. Those weren't her bones. What? Examined the crime scene photos. Bonnie was tall, that femur was way too small to be hers. Isn't that why you had to steal them back? You're very feisty this morning, Eve. What? Like it. Just follow the light. Find the songbird and you may just catch me. In the meantime, take care of our little girl. Make her feel safe for the first time in her life. Then I'll kill you both. Phone beeps is that him? Go back to sleep. He's not going to stop, is he? No. I'd bring you back to child services but what? Can't be sure you'd be safe. What? Heard you're going to flagstaff. Are you taking me? What? Don't know. What? Don't want to end up like fay. What? Want to take my chances with you. Ok. Welcome to flagstaff, miss Duncan. I'm herbie. Head of security for mr Wallace. Nice to meet you. You too. Can what? Go in now? Yeah, check it out. Hi! Take care, Jane. Bye. I'll grab those. Thank you. What? Don't know how to thank you for getting US here under the radar. Literally. Yeah. Pilot's licence has come in handy more than once in my line of work. Anyway, I've got to get back. If the feds are looking for you, maybe what? Can make a little smoke, point them in the wrong direction. What? Won't forget this. Yeah, what? Know. What? Won't let you. Look, just keep in touch and what? Promise what? Won't write anything until you guys catch him. Ok. Ok. So, there's two bedrooms on this level, three upstairs. There's food in the fridge or what? Can arrange for a private cook, if you like. No, what? Think we'll be fine on our own. Ok. Did mr Wallace explain my situation? Yes, he did. And he wanted to let you know that you are more than welcome to stay here as long as you want. Thank you. Now, you've got to live video feeds to the security cameras, and if you need anything, 24/7, you can get hold of me or Eric, he's the other guard. Great, thank you. Ok. So, are you rich or something? I've helped some rich people. The man who owns this house lost someone close to him and what? Was able to reunite them. What do you even do? I'm a forensic sculptor. Say someone finds a body. Just bones, though. Somewhere, someone is looking for that person. Waiting for them to come home. What? Help the authorities figure out what they looked like. That's kind of weird. So, have you always wanted to do this? Like, since you were my age? No. What? Do it because of my daughter. Thought you must have had a child, with all the tucking in and whatever. So, where is she? Phone rings sorry, got to take this. Hi, mom. What do you think you're doing? Joe says you kidnapped that little girl. Is that why you're calling, to yell at me? Joe wants to talk to you. Here he is. Don't hang up. Don't ask me where what? Am. This isn't about that. We've got the DNA results back on the rib bone. It's Bonnie's. So, even though those weren't her bones at Talladega... Dom knows where she is. Thank you for telling me. Eve, come home. We'll figure this out together. What? Can't do that. What? Am taking a lot of heat for you. Spiro thinks what? Know where you are and Sandra is driving me crazy. With me gone, mom should be safe, you all should be. Shut up, that is not helping and you know it. Tell me where you are. You ok? Ls that about your kid? What? Had a daughter, Bonnie. She was murdered many years ago. By the same guy? The man who killed her is dead, but they knew each other. Dom's using you to get to me. But what? Have nothing to do with you and neither did fay. What? Know. But he thinks that you look like Bonnie. You got a picture? Yeah. I'm sorry she's dead but I'm not your little girl. What? Know. But what? Still want to keep you safe. Where were you all ten months ago when my foster dad was whipping me? Whipping me because the falcons lost? I'm sorry that happened but I'm here now. If you really want to go back... What? Didn't say that. So, why were you up all last night? Well, dom buried something, and if what? Can find it, maybe what? Can find him. You're talking about a body, right? You know what? Watch TV. Fine. Yes, the woman we're going to meet is going to help US find it. Is she a psychic? No. Eve Duncan! So good to hear from you. This is my friend, Jane. Jane, this is Sarah. Hey! And her dog, monty. And Sarah and what? Worked a bunch of search and recovery jobs together. He's so cute. Can what? Pet him? Sure. He doesn't bite, unless what? Tell him to. This is Debbie Jordan. Come on, monty! She was married, had two little ones. Good boy! So, this dom guy killed her and then buried her near flagstaff? These woods are thick, Eve. You know, last time what? Talked to dom, he kept telling me to follow the light. Wow, cryptic and unhelpful. Well, the FBI found an old murder that might be his. The body was buried in a suburb here called San Luz. Spanish for Saint light? You want to guess what Talladega means? Fast cars? The falls of tumbling light. Every place he buried his victims has to do with light. So, parks, fields, nurseries... This is a huge haystack. What? Know you like a challenge. So, three days ago, you didn't even know this kid, and today, you're the only thing keeping her alive. Three clays ago, it was all about Bonnie. Her bones, putting the past to rest. Now, Jane... ...she's all what? Can think about. Have you turned on the news? Do you know how much trouble you're in? This kid is worth the risk. What? Don't need a gun. You don't need one until you do, and then you'll wish you had it. Do you know how to use it? Joe taught me. Of course, the joys of dating a former Navy seal. We are not dating! Are you going to help US or not? Ok. We're in. The pastor said she wore this every sunday. The field is in back of the desert light subdivision. You know that this is going to take forever? It's also close to her church. She's a very stubborn woman, monty. Up! Let's go. He could be using non-dump sites, like he did in Talladega. We should check them out. Good idea. Let's take a break. Well, it is really good to see you, Evie. Despite the circumstances. I've missed you. What? Know I'm terrible at keeping in touch. What? Consider you one of my best friends. I'm going to try harder. Yeah, right. Promises, promises. No, really. You never judge me. That's because what? Get you. Do you think anyone who's never experienced loss can really understand? No. But that doesn't mean that they can't feel for you. And if you're talking about Joe, well, what? Like him. He thinks everything's so simple. Men are simple, you have to appreciate that! You scared? No. That worries me. Me too. Herb, thanks for looking after her. No problem, miss Duncan. Goodnight. Monty. Monty! Good boy. Hey! Did you have fun here today? Yeah, it was ok but why can't what? Help you go guys search? Because its work, not play. You should be in school, but... Why do you care anyway? Because what? Know what it's like being a kid in a tough spot. What? Grew up in techwood. You so did not. Really? Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't matter where you start your life. You can go anywhere. Goodnight. Well, that was a long and unrewarding day. Until now, of course. Hey, what's wrong? It's happening. Just like he wants. What is, what are you talking about? Dom wants me to love her. To him, she's just a stand-in for my dead daughter. If he's been watching her like you said, then he knows she is more than that. She's tough. Like you. She is tough. Thanks. Yeah, it makes me think that... ...i didn't prepare Bonnie for the world. You know, she was such a sweet girl. God! She was so trusting. Maybe she needed to be wary, like Jane. So, what, now you're blaming yourself for Bonnie's murder? Come on. Jane hugged me just now. For all of her attitude, she's just this warm little girl who's completely alone. It can't be wrong to care for her, can it? Dog whines what have you got, boy? Phone rings hello? Welcome home, Eve. Dom, what do you want? Just to talk. Come on in, I'll fix you a drink. You're bluffing. You didn't see the security guard at his post, did you? That's because what? Killed him. He's off doing his rounds. The only rounds he was doing was one to the temple. What? Know you. You're still hiding under a rock somewhere. You just got a little bored tonight. It's never boring with you, Eve. He chuckles you're getting warmer. If you touch one hair on her head... It's ok, it's ok, it's me, it's me, it's me. Chuckling you ok? Just kidding. You ok? And what? Thought he was in the house and he just killed Jane. He's playing games, Eve, that's what he does. How was what? Supposed to know you'd be up there? How did you find me? How did you even get in? I'm a detective, what? Showed her my badge. And no, what? Didn't tell spiro. Sounds like you're still mad at me. What, for letting me think that a psycho had murdered you or hanging up on me twice? You disappear again, what? Will kill you myself. Jane ok? Yeah. Finding debby Jordan is the key to finding dom. It's a gut feeling. Come on, tell me I'm on a wild goose chase, tell me I'm crazy. Something. Drag me back to Atlanta or join the search, but I'm done hiding. When have you ever hidden, Eve? When what? Thought that you were dead... ...my world became very empty. What? Didn't like it. You know I'm sorry. Yeah, well, you're going to have to trust me, Eve. Ok? What? Won't keep you out of this, but you've got to stop hiding stuff from me. Deal? Deal What? Hate fighting with you. Then stop doing it. Goodnight. Goodnight. Keep going, monty, find her. What? Was wondering when you were going to show up. Our girl was trying to ditch me. That's because she doesn't know a good thing when she's got it. Mom, hello? I'm right here. He picked up a scent. Hey, what have you got, boy? Monty? He's found something. There's a body here. Are you sure? This is it? Yep. Good boy. Come here. Good boy. This was dug up recently. What do we do now? We excavate ourselves, it won't hold up in court. It's time to call spiro. So did you talk to spiro? Yeah, he's willing to work with US, but the Atlanta pd and child services is looking for you, so you need to stay low. Yes, detective. Whatever you say. What were you doing up there? Sweet. She thinks she's ugly. You care about her, don't you? Well, after everything she's been through, she still finds a reason to laugh. You know, she's pretty taken with you, too. Eve, you could still have a family if you wanted. What, are you proposing? Maybe I'm proposing...Something. Is this because you thought what? Was dead? Because that's bound to make you emotional. And confused, even. Emotional, maybe, but I'm not confused. You're my best friend. What? Hear that's a great place to start. Goodnight. Flagstaff pd dug up the body at 2.30 this morning. We told them what? Got the location from an anonymous source. We just got the positive ID an hour ago. It's debby Jordan. There was a pink candle in her right hand. Cause of death was strangulation. She had ligature marks on her ankles and her wrists. Can she lead US to him? Autopsy's still happening. Good morning. You must be Jane. You must be the FBI. Well, what? Am if you won't hold it against me. It's ok, they're here to help. We need to get her back to Atlanta. No. It's not negotiable. Excuse me? You're not in a position to negotiate anything. What? Could've sent the police here. Yeah, but you didn't. What? Led you to his freshest kill. You know he's going to call me again. I'm your best shot at catching him. You willing to bet this kid's life? Is he going to Bury me, too? She's got to be telling US something. Well, the candle confirms her connection to dom. Did you guys notice anything weird? Well, she's still wearing her rings, but... We know dom's never been a thief. Yeah, but what about this ring here? Looks like a class ring. A 33-year-old mom doesn't usually wear her class ring any more. Can you get it for me? Yeah. Girl's ring, class of 1981. Initials on it are "egh". It's definitely not debby's. It's got to be this girl's ring. Eliza grace Harding. She disappeared right here in flagstaff in 1981. You think Eliza's your San Luz body? Dom's first victim. But why would he lead US to her? It looks like he wants to get caught. This guy is highly organised. He makes the bait just tempting enough, the investigation just hard enough. Exactly. He deliberately gives US our best chance of catching him. It's part of his game. Well, what? Say we beat him at his own game. Can you get the police report on Eliza's disappearance? Yeah. And the detective who worked it. He's still alive. Nice work, Charlie. Spiro's going to be impressed. Agent spiro and what? Went to see Eliza Harding's parents. DNA matches the San Luz body. It's hers. What about her disappearance? What do they know? Well, apparently, Eliza spent most of the summer of 1980 hanging out at a coffee house with this kid Kevin Shaw and his brothers. Kevin wanted her to go to la with him and start a band, then she vanished. So, where's Kevin Shaw now? He disappeared the same time as Eliza. Maybe dom killed both of them. Yeah, but only the female body was found. Makes me think that Kevin might be dom. You know, if la was his idea. Yeah, that whole runaway angle, to keep the local police from looking too hard. Let's find Kevin Shaw. You know, mr Harding said that one of the brothers mentioned they were from Dillon. It's up in the mountains. That trail is more than 30 years cold. 30 years ago, he probably made some mistakes. Ok. Let's go to Dillon. What? Don't want to leave Jane alone. And if dom is watching, you don't want him to see that you've bonded with her. Charlie can stay here and guard Jane. What? This was my lead. And what? Will give you full credit in my report. Now you have your assignment. What else did you guys get from Eliza's parents? Mrs Harding had a photograph of Kevin. Was a little blurry. What? Sent it off to Quantico to see what they could pull out of it. I'm pretty good at photo work. I'll get you a copy. Hey, Charlie, you find any school records for the kids in Dillon? None. What about court records? Courthouse burned down six years ago. Really? Somebody covering their tracks? Small town. Welcome to Dillon, Arizona. There are no shaws in the phone book but somebody ought to remember them. We should split up to cover more ground. Yeah, good idea. I'll take the north side of the street. Why don't you take the south side? We can meet up. You got it. Bell rings hello. May what? Help you? Can what? Ask you a few questions? I'm doing some research, trying to track down a family that used to live here. The Shaw. What's this about, anyway? What? Think their son, Kevin, might have... ...grown-up to be dangerous. Wouldn't surprise me. Please, it's really important to me. Old man Shaw was an evangelist. Real fire and brimstone type. He had a big tent on the plateau north of town. What? Was a little wild when what? Was a girl, and my daddy thought what? Needed some saving. I'm sorry. What? Know this is difficult, but anything you can remember might be helpful. What? Remember reverend Shaw standing up there, waving that red candle at me. Telling me what a whore what? Was. He used candles? Yeah. Different colours for different sins, he used to say. Do you know what happened to his family? What? Don't know. They all disappeared after the big fire. Look at me, getting upset. It's funny how the things that happen to you as a kid leave the deepest scars. This place feels haunted. The fire was 30 years ago. Police blamed it on the candles and called it an accident. They investigate it? Didn't find anything. When Shaw disappeared they just figured he and the family took off. No-one searched for bodies? Not according to the report. It's no surprise. Guys like Shaw were travelling men. Talked to a bartender back in town. He remembered the boys. He said that the reverend always had a problem with Kevin. Jacob and Ezekiel, they'd say hallelujah and pass the plate, but Kevin never wanted to play the game. Maybe the reverend pushed Kevin too far and the killer was born. Or it was made. It's strange. The fire was 30 years ago. Why hasn't the grass grown back? Ground's been salted. Somebody doesn't want anything living here. Somebody died here. What? Can feel it. Let's get a forensic team up here. Hey, you. What? Found this on the dresser. It's this pretty girl what? Know. Does that mean pretty on the inside? Cos you know that means ugly. Hey. You are beautiful. And smart and funny. And you are going to rock this world. So, how did it go in Dillon? Was it him? What? Think so. Is he still coming for me? He is one sick man. And you have Joe, and Charlie, and Sarah. And monty. And monty. And you? And me. I'm not going anywhere. Ok. Phone rings You've been busy. Hello, Kevin. What? Much prefer dom. Kevin doesn't exist any more. Yeah? He burn up in a fire, perhaps? Along with the rest of your family? Of course what? Killed them. But you won't be finding any bodies in those ashes. Why did you do it? My father saw Satan in me from the time what? Was a child. He'd make me hold a black candle while he beat me. And he'd rub salt in the wounds. Maybe he was right. Do you think we're born with the seeds of evil? What? Think you were. But you didn't destroy Kevin completely. We have records. Photos. We're going to find you. Not that way. What colour candle do you want to hold? White for Jane, that's easy. Owl hoots What's up? A bad dream? Dom called. What? Wish it was a dream. You want to talk about it? Are you sure? He chuckles yes, I'm really here. You really did this. Good morning. Come on, admit it, we're good together. I'm still processing. Let me process. Hey, what better protection from a serial killer than to have a cop in your bed beside you, right? You know, you joke, but that's exactly what I'm talking about. From the moment you met me, my life has just been chaos and drama. You were my rock when Bonnie was killed. All through the trial and Fraser's execution. And a decade since. What's your point? You wouldn't recognise a normal relationship with me. You think it will really be as exciting when it's all just electric bills and car payments? ...l don't know, this feels pretty exciting. Ok, you know what, what? Admit, at the start, what? Was a little protective. Joe Friday, damsel in distress thing. That does not change how what? Feel about you. And how's that? What? Want to spend the rest of my life with you. Beep Spiro's on his way over. Saved by the bell. What? Told you it wasn't much. Mrs Harding says the kid holding the flag is Kevin Shaw. That's Jacob and Ezekiel on the left. Well, if that's Kevin, with the water damage, we can't be sure. We could check local corrections but without the negatives, it's kind of a long shot. There's a new digital imaging system out of Berkeley that works miracles. Quantico tried that. No go. Who tried at Quantico? Shipman? He probably give up after the first chromatic aberration. Let me at it. Who else has this imaging system? Local newspaper might. What? Think what? Know someone who can help. So, this Mark grundard. He flies all the way from Atlanta just to get Charlie into a photo lab. Ls that right? Well, that and what? Promised him his in-depth interview. He's been chomping at the bit for his exclusive. Yeah, it seems like he's your go-to guy these days. You know, given the facts. Ok, detective, explain these facts. Who did what? Sleep with last night? Beep beep she sighs what's wrong? Charlie said he's on his way over here. If he had something, wouldn't he just call? Maybe he's got something he needs to show US in person. Charlie should have been here by now and what? Can't reach him. Something's wrong. I'll drive. Monty! Come on. Can you tell Jane I'll be back in about an hour? She'll be fine. She'll be with monty. You guys be careful. We'll be at the photo lab in 15 minutes. What the hell is this? My god, there's spiro. What happened? What? Just got here myself, but it looks like Charlie went off the road. More like forced off the road. What's the hold-up? They're waiting for a winch so they can stabilise the SUV. Joe, wait for the winch! Joe! You shouldn't be here. Your apb photo is everywhere. What? Can smell the gas from here. The s guys know what they're doing. All it takes is one spark. Come on, Joe, get out of there. Explosion Joe! He was in there! We don't know that. He went in. Don't you get it? We don't know that. Go! Get that oxygen over here! Charlie? He was dead when what? Found him. No. Is Mark still at the photo lab? It was stuck under the front seat. What? Was trying to pry it out when what? Realised the car was going to blow. He's not answering. What? Can call the lab and see if they could e-mail me Charlie's backup files. What? Have to call Charlie's wife. God, he was such a good guy! Yeah, he was. Are you ok? Leave me alone. Eve! Come on, Eve! What the hell's going on? Talk to me. You could have died. Yeah, what? Could have, but what? Didn't. So why are you so angry? Because you kissed me. You told me you wanted to spend the rest of your life with me. And then what? Have to watch, helpless, as the rest of your life shrinks to a pinpoint. Yeah, "". It's ok. It's over. No, it's not over. Because you're a cop. You're going to continue doing stupid things and taking risks and what? Can't live like that. Are you trying to tell me that you love me? I'm not telling you anything. Idiot. Because it's a little hard to decipher through all the verbal abuse. Are you going to tell me that you love me some day? Probably not. Because you don't deserve it. Maybe. But regardless, what? Promise you, I'm not going to take any chances that what? Don't absolutely have to. What? Thought losing Bonnie was more than what? Could live with. If what? Lost you too, what? Just... It just hurts, that's all. Listen to me. I'm not going anywhere, ok? You're never going to lose me. Ever. Ok? Promise. Ever. Is that...? ...Mark? What? Don't under... what? Don't understand. How? Grundard's the right age. He talked his way into your life. What? Thought it was weird what? Couldn't reach him tonight. He always answers his phone. I'm going to send agents to his hotel. What? Sent Mark to Charlie. Eve, there's no way you could have known. What? Let Mark in! He always knew where what? Was! If he touches her, what? Swear to god, I'm going to kill him. No, nothing's going to happen. Ok? So, this is almost over, right? What? Mean, every cop in the country's out looking for him. Well, he's been doing this for 30 years, what? Wouldn't underestimate him. Phone rings it's spiro. Hello? Get out of there now. Is it dom? No. Flagstaff pd is going to be at your door any minute. Pd's on their way. They got an anonymous tip as to your whereabouts. One guess who called it in. But Mark wants me with her. Not any more. The game's almost over. If he can blast you out of hiding into jail, Jane's vulnerable. How much time? None. Eve, what? Mean it, get out of there now. Ok. Sarah, get monty and go. Joe, get Jane up. We leave in two minutes. I'm right here. Get dressed fast, sweetie. Too late. They're already here. Ok, Jane, listen. The police are here and they're going to want to take you with them. No! Tell them what? Want to go with you. No, what? Know, but what? Still need to go with them and answer questions. No, please don't go! Listen, Joe is going to keep an eye on you until what? Get out but what? Will get out and what? Will come find you. Ok? Sweetie, what? Know you're strong, but what? Still need to hear it. Police! Open the door! Atlanta child services will want her back. You have to protect her. What? Will. What? Promise. Ok. It's going to be ok. I'm trying to get you out on bail. It's kidnapping and interstate flight. What? Don't think you get bail. Child services know there are extenuating circumstances. They just wanted Jane back. They're going to send a car to pick her up, she's going to be safe. It's not enough. He always seems to know what our next move is. Mark's on the run. Why would he go after her? He'll never run. That would mean he lost. If he can't kill the both of US, he'll settle for killing her. I'm doing everything what? Can to get you out of here. But it's not going to happen before tomorrow. What? Really want to kiss you. The good news is they've dropped the charges. The bad news is you cannot go anywhere near Jane. Hey, I'm out, where's Jane? She's fine. I'm just leaving the safe house now. They put her on an earlier flight. She's got a police escort. Hurry up. I've got a bad feeling. Something is not adding up. What? Have to get to my computer. Phone rings I have her. What? Know. Tell me what you want. You're supposed to beg. You're not making this much fun. Let me talk to her. She's asleep. What? Had to give her a little something to keep her quiet. Do not hurt her. She'll hear your dying screams before her own. Unless you can save her. It's the chance you never got with Bonnie. He chuckles when? Where? The place where it all started. Dial tone she dials this is spiro. Mark has Jane. He's taking her to Dillon, to the plateau, at midnight. Meet me there. Eve, this sounds like you're considering something stupid. I'm giving you the chance you've been waiting for. Let's catch him. Spiro. Are you ready? We're in position about two miles down the road. Key your radio mic twice when you verify Mark is there. Just don't move in until what? Know Jane is alive. Did Joe give you a weapon? Sarah gave me one. What? Couldn't tell Joe what what? Was doing, he never would have let me come. It's going to be ok. Don't worry. Phone rings this is Eve. What? Left the light on for you. Let me talk to Jane. Eve! Don't do what he says! Ten minutes. Hello? Sarah? Jane is within a ten-minute walk of the plateau. Thank god she's still alive. Ok, we're on it. Just listen. If he kills me, just make sure Jane is safe. Please. What? Will, but it's not going to come to that, so just be careful. Gun cocks that's how what? Staked out my father. It's a little welcome present. You like it? It's easy playing monster-catcher when you know how they think. So there's no cavalry coming. Afraid not. Put your weapon on the ground. Now! What? Will kill you without blinking. You might kill me, but you'll never get away with it. They'll realise you tampered with the photos. By then, I'll be set up in my next life. So, what, you just keep on killing? How many over the years? I've lost count. It was a challenge, passing that psych exam, to be a profiler. But once what? Did, well, it was almost too easy. That's why what? Liked you, Eve. You made it fun. What did Fraser tell you? Where's my daughter? Bonnie is buried all alone in chattahoochee national park. You're going to be buried right here, hundreds of miles away. Maybe. You come back here! Come and get me. Eve! The game is over! Thwack he coughs now the game is over, you son of a bitch. Who...? Joe. He was a sniper in the seals. He's about 800 yards away. We just needed you to come into the light. That photo of Kevin Shaw, that was a pretty good fake. But what? Could see that it had been doctored, just like Charlie saw. What? Digitally combined your brothers' faces. After what? Did the age progression, the resemblance was unmistakable. Where's Jane? What? Put false trails down. You'll never find her. Eve, what? Knew you'd love her. He laughs, gun cocks Eve, go help Sarah find Jane. I'll be right there. What? Don't want it to be quick. Jane! Jane! Rescue 1, rescue 2, when we get to the bridge, you take the north side of the slope, and I'll take the south side. Rescue 2, Roger that. Jane! Jane! Jane? Jane! Jane! Hold up, hold up, there, buddy. Jane? Easy, monty. Easy. Jane! Jane! Jane? What have you got? What have you got, puppy? What have you got? Ok, Sarah's up ahead. She's covering the eastern and southern paths, but monty is all over the place. Spiro wasn't lying about the false trails. What else did he say? He told me where Bonnie was buried. What? Know he might be lying, but i'm never going to stop looking, Joe. Well, you're not going to have to do it alone, all right? Monty barks we're moving, let's go! Jane! Jane! Jane? Jane? Whining monty? Monty! Go! She's here! She's here! It's ok. It's ok, what? Got you. It's ok. I'm going to get you out of here. Good boy. Ls she all right? It's ok, all right, come on. Hey, good boy. She's ok. She's ok. Thank god. Jane. Good boy. Are you ok? Yeah. Is he dead? Yeah. Jane, would you like to come live with me? With US? Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that. Ok. Come here, honey. God, it's good to see you. Come on, let's go. Can we get a dog? You hear that, monty? Subtitles by ericsson
