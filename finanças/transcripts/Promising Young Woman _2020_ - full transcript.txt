- Fuck her! - Fuck her. Yeah, fuck her! This is how business is done. It's supposed to... It's just a round of fucking golf. You'd think we were taking clients out to a strip club... - which we can't even do anymore. - Exactly. We can't even do that anymore because of Christmas party last year. I think it's because the golf club doesn't let women play there. So? So... it means we're having client meetings without... Look, she should just focus on closing her own shit instead of whining about how we're doing better than her. Jesus. Look at that good God almighty. Don't you got some dignity, sweetheart? Yeah, They put themselves in danger, girls like that. If she's not careful someone's gonna take advantage specially kinda guys in this world. She's kind of hot. Hot fucking mess. Hey, let's talk to Brian, I think he might be amenable to the idea if we all present I mean that is just asking for it. Ah, look at that. I think you'd learn by that age? Right? Where are even her friends? They just ran off somewhere? Leaving her lying around for anyone to pick up. Sounds like a challenge, Paul. Yeah, maybe. I'll go over. Oh ho! Jerry. - I didn't know you had it in you! - To see if she's OK. - Yeah, no of course. - Sure. Go for it. - Yeah, I'd just go and see. - Go for it, big fella. Oh my God. Hey. You okay? What are you looking for? - Phone. - Uh-huh. It's not here. It's gotta be here, just... Uh, you think maybe you left it in the bathroom or something? No. You gonna be okay? Oh, yeah. How you gonna get home? - Ride, ride out. - Yeah, yeah. I think you might need a phone for that. Yeah. I know. OK, look, I'm headed out anyway, so I can drop you off. - No. - It's totally fine, it's not a problem. What are you gonna do? It's fine, come on. It's not a problem. Let's go. There we go. You got it? Alright, just hold on to the railing. - Yep, okay. - Oh my God. Come on, I just had my car cleaned. She's fine. No I'm not. Not going to throw up. Ma'am. You have it sir, she's not going to throw up. My apartment is a few blocks from here would you want to have a drink before hitting the hay? It's literally right here. You can have like one beer? Yes. Can you take us to 242 Raleigh Drive instead please? It's a couple of blocks. Just put the address in the app. Yeah. Kumquat liqueur, here we go my lady. Hey, sorry about my friends at the bar, they are they are assholes. There you go, you got it. Do you... live alone here? No, but my roommate's out of town, so, don't worry. Ugh. That's disgusting. You're so beautiful. You know what, do you mind if I just put down a little smudge. I need to lie down. Oh... yeah of course! Right this way. - Don't go to sleep. - What? Gosh, you're so pretty. - What are you... - It's okay, hey, you're safe. - What are you... - Hey, it's OK. You're safe. - Shh! - What are you doing? - God! Your body! - What are you doing? What are you doing? Hey. Hey. Hey! I said, what are you doing? _ ♪ The Weather Girls – It's Raining Men _ Whoa! Walk of shame! What's wrong, baby? Stop staring. The fuck you staring at? You can't take a joke? Fuck you then! _ Didn't hear you come in last night. Everything alright? I had to work late. Thought the coffee house closed at nine. We had to do inventory. You have to do a lot of inventory at that place. You should speak to the manager. I will. You know, I was talking to Graham earlier and he says there's a position opening at their head office. And don't freak out but I want you to know I recommended you for it. - Hi Cass... - Why did you do that? Because you're sneaking out your joint with your sad little face. But I like it here. No you don't. No, I don't. But I like you. - And I like... - Hello. Working in a customer-facing role. - Great! Can I get... - No. Cassie. Don't Cassie me. I'm fine, Gail. Really. Johnny said he saw you at The Fallout last week. Said you were completely hammered and on your own. He was a little worried. And I know, it's none of my business He must have seen someone else. I've never been there. Okay. I like a tease. Thank you. Hey, you want another drink? - Um, I gotta think. - Let me get you one. Vodka cranberry for the lady please. Hey! How old are you? Old enough, right? Can I get a coffee please? Uh huh. You want milk? What? Cassandra? - Yeah? - Ryan. Cooper. We were in class together at Forest med school. 2nd year neurology, Dr Hadid's class. Oh. Yeah. Brian. Hi. God. Why are you working here? Or, I didn't mean to... That was rude, I didn't mean... You didn't mean what am I doing working in a shitty coffee shop? Yeah, no, I just mean, you know given there's no getting out of this, is there? - Nu uh! - I'm gonna leave. Can I leave and then come back and I can do - I can do it again, it would be better. - You want milk? Pardon? In your coffee. No, but uh... you can spit in it if you want, I deserve that. Thank you. Do you want to go out with me? What? On a date? Seriously? I just spat in your coffee. Then I like to finish always with a little dab gloss just to give it a kind of wet texture. Just dab in the middle and on the top. And there you go. Perfect blow-job lips. So... Don't forget to like and subscribe, thank you guys for following. I love you, bye! Seriously, you gotta read it. 'Consider The Lobster' is one of the fucking greats, man. Cracked my head open... like... like a lobster claw. You know I'm actually writing a novel. Well, kinda, cause I'm such a fucking perfectionist, you know, it's just taking me forever. I just keep going over and over and over it my head is picking at it like a scab. It's about, I guess, like, what it is like to be a guy right now? Like, what it's like to be a guy in the world. Just this greedy, low life, fucked up love story. And then all takes place in New York over the course of one night. You know what... I'm gonna stop talking about it. I don't wanna jinx it. You do coke, right? Not really... Oh come on! - I got work in the morning... - Oh, whatever, so do I. Here. Put your little nose up to this. Let me just... There you go. Oh my God, you are so so, pretty. But why are you wearing all that make up? Do you mind me asking? I never understood why women wear so much make up. It's like you guys are so much more beautiful without it. It's like guys don't even like that kinda staff, you know? It's just a soul-sucking system made to oppress women. It's fucked up. I wanna see you. The real you. With all your freckles, your imperfections. I don't feel well. - Could you get me a glass of water? - Yeah sure. Are you fucking kidding me? Hey. Hey you. Hey! There you are! You fell asleep. Good girl. Feel better? No. You know, I nearly didn't come out tonight. I'm so glad that I did. I feel such a connection to you. - Can you call me a cab? - But you just got here. I need to go home. No, don't go. Stay. My God, you are so... I need to go. - You don't wanna go home. - I need to go home. Hey Neil. I said, I need to go home. Holy shit! Whoa. Whoa... what is this? You are some kind of psycho or something? - Why do you say that? - I just thought that you were... - Drunk? - Yeah. Really drunk? Fuck... yeah. Well, I'm not. But that's good, isn't it? I think you should leave. Oh now you want me to leave? No I just... I'm really high Look, I'm really fucking high right now. I don't know what I'm doing. I think you should go. But a second ago you were determined for me to stay You are pretty insistent actually. I'm a nice guy. Are you? I thought we had a connection, I guess. A connection? Okay. What do I do for a living? Sorry. Maybe that one's too hard. How old am I? How long have I lived in the city? What are my hobbies? What's my name? Alright. Alright. Fuck. I get your point. What do you want from me? To say that I'm an asshole? Fine, I'm a fucking asshole. Whoa! Why are you so freaked out, Neil? You really need to calm down. At least you didn't try to have sex with me while I was passed out. You do get points for that, few guys... well, they don't mind so much. But you, woke me up before putting your fingers inside me. That was sweet. What are you trying to say, that I'm like... predator or something? I don't know. Are you? I'm a nice guy. You keep saying that. You're not as rare as you'd think. You know how I know? How? Because every week I go to a club. And every week I act like I'm too drunk to stand. And every... fucking week... a nice guy like you comes over to see if I'm OK. You wanna fuck me still? No, thank you, ma'am. No one ever does. Careful, next time you go out now. Your novel sounds terrible by the way. Night, Nina. What's this? Mom, what's this? What do you mean? This gift! It's your birthday, Cassie. Oh... Yeah. What kind of kind of person forgets their 30th birthday? Oh, sweetheart, come on, don't... Don't, Stanley, now please. Don't. It was just a mistake, Mom. You know I'm terrible with dates. It's not a big deal. Not a big deal? Big deal? You... you just forgot your birthday! You don't wanna have a party? You don't wanna see your friends? - You know I don't have any friends, Mom. - Don't talk about it. Don't. Do you know how strange this is? You, you're still living here at home, working in that stupid coffee shop since you and Nina dropped out of med school you are out all night long doing god only knows what. You don't have any boyfriend, you don't have any friends. Mom! You should have saved all that for my birthday card! Why don't we just let the kid celebrate however she wants. OK? All my friends they ask about you and I don't know what to tell them. I don't know what happened here, I don't... Why don't you just open your present there, Cass, OK? Go ahead. Hope you'll like that. Thank you. Whoa! - Yeah. - That's direct. A real kick in the cunt. Is it a nice suitcase, at least? Oh yeah it's definitely the fanciest “get the fuck out of our house” metaphor I've received so far. So, why don't you? - What? - Get the fuck out of their house just? I don't know go on... single wife, female, some girl get a basement room in some weird guy's house, anything. I can't afford it, Gail. Not on what you pay me. Not even a weird guy's basement. So take this other job then. Take any job. Are you firing me? Maybe I should. Look. You're making the assumption that I want any of it. If I wanted a boyfriend and a yoga class and a house and kids and a job my mom could brag about I'd have done it. It would take me ten minutes. I don't want it. I don't want it. But you must want something? Hey. Oh. You. Hi. One coffee. Hold the spit. She spat on my coffee last time. I'm back because um... I think you gave me a fake number the other day. - Doesn't sound like me. - I know, so... I spent a few hours composing a like very witty, very romantic text, and then I sent that text to an oil rig worker called Red. Was he into it? Surprisingly into it. It was like immediately inappropriate, but it's not gonna work out because of the oil rig, so, I thought I'd try you again. - I just heard a phone ring in the back. - No you didn't. I most definitely heard a phone ring in the back. She has to take a few imaginary calls a day. Look, if you are not into this, I totally get it. I'm not really looking to date anyone at the moment. Right, yeah. Me neither, would you... be interested in a friendship and I'm secretly pining for you the whole time? Dating is horrible. Everyone is horrible. OK. I went on a date last month with a woman who wanted to euthanize the homeless. You went on a date with my mom? Look, I always liked you in med school. OK? I genuinely liked you, and I can't stop thinking about you spitting in my coffee so, go to lunch with me this weekend please. If you don't like it we can have a safe word and you can leave, no questions asked. Not that You mind the killings. Your Book is full of killings. But there are things you do hate, Lord: Perfume-smellin' things lacy things, things with curly hair... Hey! You are all dressed up, where are you going? I'm going out for lunch. With who? A friend. Cassie. You look very pretty honey. Thank you dad. What! Where did she get a skeleton? She got it, it was, it was her grandfather's stuff. It was, she got it from the staff room but the worst part is, she looked me in the eye, pulled it out, and then waved it at me. I am done. And I am wondering why I told that story. Hey, there is nothing more romantic than a disturbed woman pulling a skeleton's hand out of her vagina. That's true. That's very true. No one ever pulls anything out of anywhere where I work. - Right! So you didn't wanna... - What? Carry on with med school? Or... - No. - Really? Why not? I wanted to do something else. What? I don't know. You were so good though. You knew everything. You, I didn't know everything. You did! You were incredible. I was... I was awful, I, remember I removed the wrong kidney from my cadaver? And look at you now. Operating on children. Yes. I got better. Thank God, but you were, way ahead of everybody. You... You'd have been a great doctor. I just didn't want it enough, I guess. You wanna get coffee or something? We... we have some time before the movie. I can tell you about the guy who got his dick trapped in a tambourine. Oh my God! Do you think, people would think you are my daughter from behind? Because of the height, the height! I'm saying. It's like a fear I have in public, if I'm with a woman my fear is that like if I kiss her, like people will be like stop kissing that child. I shouldn't yell this part. I mean, try not being so tall. - Tall? - Yeah Yes, flashy. This is, this is a weird coincidence. What? I think, no, yep, this is my apartment. - What a weird, weird coincidence. - Yeah. Do you wanna, I mean we are here, do you wanna... - go up have a drink or... - Sure, why not? It's too soon, sorry. I wasn't... No. Let's go upstairs. I don't wanna go up if you don't... wanna... I misread things, I'll drive you home. You know what. You're at your place. I can call a cab. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. OK. I feel like I fucked this up. No, no, it's not you. Cassie! What... What are you... what are you doing here? I just came to pick up my herpes medication. You have herpes too. That saves us an awkward conversation. So, I... So, I would like to see you again. - That's cool? - Yeah. But we'd need to take it slow. - I understand. - Of course. It's alright. I... I can take it slow I can barely move if you'd like. Thank you. I could write a poem. This is awesome. What're you doing? You wanna get down or something? Are you working? Well, no, um... he has leukemia and there is really nothing I can do for him. It's... it's over. I'm kidding, my shift's over. I'll grab my stuff.OK? Don't leave. Oh my God. What? Are you seeing that guy? No. Oh... good for you. So, Ryan... - Pediatric surgeon, huh? - Yes. Yes. You ever killed any children? What? While operating on them, have you ever killed any children? No, no. - Really? - Gail! I'm, well, kids... have passed while I have been operating. - So that's a Yes? - Gail! Stop asking him is he's killed children. I will stop asking him when he stops killing children. That, that seems fair. That seems fair. I'll leave you two lovebirds to it. - Can you lock up for me honey? - Of course. Now, if you two decide to have sex on the counter the bleach is in the back room. Ain't no one gonna walk in here tomorrow morning, and see ass prints in the coffee grinds, got it? Got it lover boy? Yeah. Have fun you two, my God! She seems nice. She is, she is a good friend. Are you friends with anyone from Forest still or...? No. Really, no one, no one? Really. No one. I can't, I can't... shake them off. You still hanging out with those guys? They are not that bad, they aren't. Really. Oh my God, Madison McPhee just had twins. She's completely obsessed. I've never remembered Madison. You... I thought you were close. You guys and that other girl... No. Huh? Oh my God, Al Monroe is marrying this bikini model, he got this hideous tattoo of her named, proposed amazingly, she said yes. Classic Al, you know, landing on his feet. - Al Monroe? - You must remember Al. Yeah. I thought he moved to London. Yeah, he was there for years, but he just moved back to get married. Do you see him a lot? Uh, we are not close, but he is in the group. We actually see each other at work because he is an anesthesiologist. Good for him. He is getting married. I know, God help her. _ _ _ - Welcome to the Hotel St Germain. - Thank you. One ginger ale, and one bottle of champagne. - Don't worry. I can do that. - Oh, but it's... Cassie. - Madison! - Oh my God! You look amazing! I almost didn't recognize you. - You look exactly the same. - You are sweet. I look so old... No. That's what having twins will do to you, it's tragic. Do you have kids? No. You will get there. Champagne, what are we drinking to? To old friends. Honestly, I thought I'd be bored out of my skull watching the kids but it's been great actually. Are we out already? Can we get another bottle? Thanks. I haven't been day-drunk in for ever, so fun... So fun! TBH I know all guys say they want wives that work but it's not true. No? No, I mean, They all want a feminist in college, because it's cool to have a girlfriend who cares about something. And statistically, feminists are more likely to do anal. That's literal fact, by the way. Really? You know, when it comes down to it, all guys want the same thing. And what's that? A good girl. I don't seem to remember you were that much of a good girl at med school. Well, for things, Fred didn't know me at school. He met me when I was working at L'Oreal. Poor Fred. What he doesn't know won't kill him. Eh? I'm glad everything's worked out so well for you, Madison. - Oh yes, it really has. - Yeah. You know. I actually wanted to meet you today, to talk about something in particular. I did wonder. No one has heard from you in, like, forever. I wanted to talk to you about why I dropped out. - OK. Sure. - You remember what happened, right? - It was such a long time ago now... - I know, but you remember? I mean... vaguely. Do you ever think about it? - Why would I? - Right. Why would you. So, if a friend came to you now, into your house and told you that they thought something bad had happened to them the night before - Cassie... - Something bad... - It was years ago. - What would you say? What would you say? I'm a little weird... Would you roll your eyes behind her back and dismiss the whole thing as drama? I don't know why you're mad at me! OK! I'm not the only one who didn't believe it. In fact, if you have a reputation for sleeping around then maybe people aren't gonna believe you when you say something has happened. I mean... it's... crying wolf. You thought it was crying wolf? I don't make the rules. Look, when you get that drunk, things happen. Don't get... blackout drunk all the time and then expect people to be on your side when you have sex with someone you didn't want to! That's a shame. I was hoping you'd feel differently by now. Sorry! For your sake. I was hoping you'd feel different by now. Look... Don't be mad, just, I'll get the check. Alright? It's my treat. Hello. Are you okay Madison? My head is spinning, I just feel like... Oh. Shit! God... Sorry. It was really so great, seeing you again. You really haven't changed at all. That's great. So? She's over there. Room 25. - Your money's in the envelop. - You're sure about this? I'm sure. Cassie. Hi... wonderful to see you for lunch yesterday, blast from the past. Uh, hey, I was pretty drunk, I can't really look, did you see me talking with a guy, like our age, he seemed to know you, just trying to piece some things together Cassie, sorry, please call me back, I'm freaking out a little. I woke up in a, one of the hotel rooms I think something might have happened, I don't know. _ - Scream out bitches! - Bye. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hi... - Me? - Yeah. - Hi, I'm sorry. - What's up? I'm so sorry but my phone has died and I'm so late for work. Do you live round here? Do you know the area? I guess. Why? Would you tell me how to get to the Castle Diner? You know what! I'm actually really late - Please, I'm supposed to be shooting this music video. - Music video? Yeah. I'm a make-up artist and it's my first time working with these guys and if I'm late I may as well... Oh my God, oh my God! Are you working for Wet Dreams? - You didn't see that. - I know where the Castle Diner is! Don't worry about it, I would ask someone else. NO way, no way! Oh my God! You are working with Wet Dreams! Oh my God! - Are they in there right now? - You need to calm down. - I'll direct you. Please! - Sorry no! If I don't direct you, how are you gonna find it? I can't. If you tell anyone or you post about this I'll never work again. I swear I won't post anything, I promise. Take my phone! Seriously. Take it. Oh god. OK get in. Fine. But you have to be cool about this. Of course I will. Whoa. You really are a fan. I'm ob-sessed. I have a whole insta dedicated just to George's dog. Well, you see, coincidence. I know. You know what. This... This is fate. Sure seems like it. Yes? Dean Walker is waiting if you'd like to get one through. Daisy? - That's me. - Dean Walker, please sit. My assistant says that you're interested in resuming med school. That's right. May I ask what prompted your desire to get back to your studies. I guess... I couldn't stop thinking about my time here. Yeah, it's an extraordinary place. It's an unusual request. Yes. But I left under unusual circumstances. Oh. I left because of what happened to Nina. Nina Fisher. You don't remember her? Maybe you remember Alexander Monroe? Oh, yes. Alexander Monroe, he actually just came back and gave a talk here. Oh, he's a really nice guy, who is smart, are you friend of his? No. So, you don't remember the accusations made again Al Monroe? I don't. He took a girl Nina Fisher, the one you don't remember back to his room where he had sex with her, repeatedly and in front of his friends, while she was too drunk to have any idea of what was going on. She was covered in bruises the next day. Hand prints I guess she could say. Was it reported? Yes. Do you know who Nina spoke to? You. But you can't remember so... You felt there wasn't sufficient evidence. You said it was too much of a 'he said/she said' situation. Well, you know we get accusations like this all the time. One or two a week, I'm sorry I don't remember your friend Nina but I can assure you at that time that I looked into it thoroughly. His friends were all watching. Laughing. It's so hard But you know, so if she was drinking, and... and maybe couldn't remember everything. So she shouldn't have been drunk? I'm not saying that. I... Sorry I don't have... I don't mean to sound critical Dean Walker, I just wanna be clear None of us want to admit, when we've made ourselves vulnerable. When we've made a bad choice and those choices, those mistakes can be so damaging. And really regrettable. Regrettable? Yes, I mean, because what would you have me do? Ruin a young man's life every time we get an accusation like this? So you're happy to take the boys word for it? I have to give him the benefit of the doubt. Of course you do. Because, innocent until proven guilty. No arguing with that. No. Thank you for your time. - Is your friend OK? - No. She's not. But Al Monroe is. You'll be glad to hear he's doing really well. He's getting married, actually, so... you know, I guess you did the right thing. We have to give these boys the benefit of the doubt. That's why I know you won't mind but three hours ago I picked your daughter Amber up from school and introduced her to the boys who live in that room now. What? She is really pretty, huh? And she looks a lot older than she is. I don't believe you. I noticed they had a few bottles of Vodka in their room too. But I'm sure they'll take good care of your daughter. She seemed excited actually! Oh. Wait... I have her phone. She'll be wanting that later. You are crazy. No. Tell me what room my daughter is in right now. I told you. The same room Nina was in. I told you I don't remember that. That's a shame. What are you doing? She is a young girl. I wonder if she looked so young to those guys. You better tell me what room she's in. Tell me what fucking room she's in. Now! You sociopath, tell me where she is. Please tell me. You are right, OK? Is that what you wanna hear? You're right. You're right... Look how easy it was! I guess you just had to think about it in the right way. I guess it feels different when it's someone you love. Tell me where my daughter is please! Relax. Dean Walker, do you really think I would do something like that? Luckily I don't have as much faith in boys as you do! Amber is sitting in a diner waiting for her favorite boy band to show up for a music video. It's the Castle Diner if you want to call and check. You should probably call actually, or she may never figure out they're not coming. She's kind of an idiot, huh? Gorgeous though. Who needs brains? They never did a girl any good. Great to see you again Dean Walker. Get out of the fucking road. Hey. You're sitting in the middle of the intersection. Hello. I'm talking to you. Look at me, you stupid cunt. Where are you going? Just gonna leave your car? In the intersection? Psycho. Chill out, okay? Calm down. Whoa, OK, look, stop, stop, stop! Crazy fucking bitch! Excuse me. Fuck you. Ryan, what are you...? She lives, I'm just kidding. You weren't answering your phone. - So I was... - Oh, shit! The movie... Alright, I'm so sorry, I had to work late. Yeah, I, I went by the coffee shop, Gail said you took the day off... - Um... - Everything alright? Yeah, no, I'm fine, I'm just in the middle of something. Totally, got it. We can make a movie still... if we skip dinner. - I'm a little tired. - Yeah. - Do you mind if I call you tomorrow? - Sure. Great. Are you OK though? You seem kinda... What? Uh... off. No, um... I'm fine, just too much coffee to work in a coffee shop. OK. - Alright, night. - Goodnight. Here we go. Watch, you mis-step here. Now, when we get to the house, we gotta be quite cause My parents might be asleep or not and we need to be respectful. This fucking surge prices. One point two, that's... That's not that far, you can walk, right? - I don't know. - Let's try, let's go. Come now. You got it, that's fine. Cassie? Ryan, what are you doing here? I'm meeting friends cause my schedule cleared up last minute. - Let me explain. - Explain... Oh, my bad dude, I didn't know the woman was taken but yeah, - she's all yours man. - Oh my... Do you know her name or... Clair wow. - Pretty close. - OK. Have a good night. Don't go Ryan, wait, please. Cassie, you didn't ignore him straight. It's stupid. You just told me. That's ice cold. That was humiliating. Why don't you just fuck off now. OK? Were you sober? Oh shit. You're that psycho that Jerry took home. I don't know what you're talking about. You know what. Not interested sweetheart. Why don't you just take crazy somewhere else? You're not even that hot. You are hardly dropping panties yourself Paul. When was the last time you scored a date like... Careful. No, you be careful. I'm not the only one who does this. And some of the other girls, they really are crazy. I don't believe you. There is a woman in this city that carries a pair of scissors. You're lying. Try it out, next time you go out, see what happens. Why you guys have to ruin everything? Can I help you? I really hope so. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm no longer practicing the law, if that's what you've come for. It's not about that. I'm afraid it's your day of reckoning. I've been waiting. Come in. Your office told me you're on sabbatical. It was very easy to get your address. They just gave it to me. I told them to give it to anyone who asked. That doesn't seem safe. There's no hiding from the piper. It has to be paid. I guess so. You seem nervous Mr Green. I came here to talk to you about something that happened 7 years ago. You probably well remembered a client name Alexander Monroe. You helped so many boys like him. And you most certainly won't remember the girl who you threatened and bullied until she dropped her case. I remember her. Nina? Was that it? I'm sorry, I don't remember her full name but It was Nina though? Wasn't it? Yes. I remember her. Have you come here to hurt me? Do you want me to hurt you? I think so. I had a... what... I think was an epiphany but my doctor's called it a psychotic episode. It was at work so, so, now I'm on ”sabbatical”. You know I got a bonus for every settlement out of court. I got another bonus for every charge dropped. We all did. There was a guy his only job was to comb through all their social media accounts for any compromising information. He contacted old friends, past sexual partners. Oh, you'd be amazed how much easier it is now at the internet to dig up dirt. In the old days, we'd have to go through a girls' trash.
