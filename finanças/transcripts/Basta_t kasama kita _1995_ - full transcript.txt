[indistinct chattering] Good evening. Good to see you. Hope you enjoy the night. Hi, how are you? I haven't seen you for a while. But instead of thinking Thanksgiving, we ended up thinking-- -Excuse me. -Thank you. So I ended up thinking about it instead. [man laughing] [indistinct chatter] -Hello! -Hello! How are you? Nice to see you too, Mr. Secretary. -Nice to see you. -Excuse me, Secretary... The princess has arrived. Excuse me. The princess has arrived. Really? Let's see. [siren wailing] -Welcome, Your Royal Highness. -Thank you. Allow me to introduce you to my wife, Ana. Hello. It's so nice to meet you, Your Highness. Thank you. Our Secretary of Foreign Affairs... Welcome, Your Highness. Our Secretary of Tourism, Miguel, and his wife, Karen. Thank you. Thank you very much. [people applauding] Thank you. Thank you very much Hi. [indistinct chattering] Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Philippine government, we welcome to this country, Her Royal Highness Princess Marinella of Bavaria. We're highly honored... that you have accepted our invitation to participate in this convention in celebration of the International Year of the Child. Ladies and gentlemen, long live! Long live! Thank you. Your Highness, may I have the pleasure of this first dance? Oh, please! This is a welcome party and you are the honored guest. But I've been dancing all night. I'm tired and I'm bored now. Please, don't! Why did Margarita have to get sick? Why indeed? If she were here instead of me, that would make you very happy. Well, she is very proper. -Yes, every inch a princess. -That is correct. And she would never embarrass you. [in Spanish] Yes. And I embarrass you. [in Spanish] Yes. Let me remind you, it's the 15th of the month. So you all better pay up! Where's your payment? Hey, face me, you coward! Pay for your shirt! -Hey, who do you think you are? -You're giving me a headache! Good grief! Pay up or else! Don't you start with me! Hi, love! -Get away from me! -What a snob! You're so arrogant! Your pits stink, you know! [Minda] You're bothering people this early in the morning! Stop pestering me! And stay away from my food! I'll pay you back! Come on! Alex, you're back. -Any food left? -Yeah. -Two orders of rice. -Anything for you! Unbelievable. Alex gets store credit but I don't? Because unlike you, Alex knows how to pay. You fill up your tab then refuse to pay back. What's the use of those muscles if you don't even work? You keep relying on your wife. Get away from here, you're bringing bad luck! That's some mouth you've got! You think having an eatery makes you better than me? Whatever! Scram! -Alex, have a drink. -No, thanks. -Who's this ring bearer? -My brother. I thought Alex didn't have siblings? This is the first time I've ever seen him. [Sare] Just give me half the payment. I haven't collected any money yet. -Alex, when did you get back? -Just now. How's your mother? Is she okay? She's dead. I'll have two chicken feet and four chicken intestines. I'll cook a new batch for you. They taste better when they're still hot. Who's he? My Mom's son. Please deliver it upstairs, Sare. Okay. Sure, sure. See how chaotic this place is? So just stay inside, especially when I'm not around. The people here don't know you yet. You're an easy target. I'm sorry, Your Highness, but it's much too late for you to go out tonight. Especially without Ms. Thompson's knowledge. -But I just want to-- -Security reasons. You understand? Now, if there's anything at all that you'd like us to get you... please don't hesitate to call. Good night, Your Highness. [sighs] [Aunt Belle humming] Oh, Aunt Belle, they won't let me out. I told you so. But I hate being a princess. I'm a prisoner. Why can't I be like you? An actress? No, I want to be free. Free to see the world! Free to do anything I want. But it wasn't easy for me, Ella. You know I was disowned by the family when I married Ricardo. Oh, it was so lonely for me. And so it is only now that your father is king that I've been allowed to set foot in the palace again. And that's because he's my brother. And all because you fell in love. Yes! Yes! And because I wanted to live. How did you know Uncle Ricardo was the right man for you? I heard the music. What music? As I looked into his eyes, my heart stopped beating and the world froze! And I seemed to float. And then from out of nowhere, I heard it. Chimes and bells and... And... And, oh, at that moment, I knew. I knew I had found the man I would love forever. Oh, Aunt Belle... How romantic! [both giggling] Oh, Ella. -Aunt Belle. -Yes? -I'm going to be like you. -Like me? I'm going into the world to find my music too. Oh, my god, Marinella. Don't even entertain such a thought! Please, Aunt Belle, please! Oh, no, Ella. It's a dangerous and cruel world outside. Very different from yours. But you did it. Why can't I? -Why can't I, Aunt Belle? -But I can't. -I can't. -Please! Please, Aunt Belle. Please, I beg you. Give me just one chance. Apart from Mama, you're the only person who understands me. Please, Aunt Belle. Only you can set me free. Please. Please, Aunt Belle. Please. Please. I beg you. Please, please, Aunt Belle. Please. I'll sleep alone here? Can't you speak Tagalog? I can. Then stop speaking in English. This isn't the place for that. I'm scared of sleeping alone. How old are you? Ten? You're too old to be a coward. There's only one room here. Hurry up. What's that? Put that away. There's no place for that here. Mom wanted you to have this. Didn't you hear what I said? Put that away. Hurry up! What now? I don't eat like that. My Dad said-- [Alex grunts] First of all, don't ever mention your parents when you're in my house. Second, I'm not rich. Now that you're staying with me, learn to live with what we have. Eat. Are you crying? [sniffles] Ooh, your father is going to kill me, I'm telling you. He will never find out. I promise. Okay. Stand up. Let me look at you. Who would ever know you're our little princess? Such a spirited child! You remind me so much of me when I was young. Oh, Aunt Belle... Don't make me cry. Don't make me cry. Don't make me cry. Don't make me cry. Now, a week, that's all you have. -Then you'll be back. -I promise! I promise! -Be careful, my child. -I'm so excited. I will. -Okay. You'll call, yes? -I won't forget. Oh, my god! This is the chance I've been waiting for my whole life! Here are some dollars. Now, don't get yourself into trouble. Thank you, Aunt Belle. -I love you, child. -I love you, too. And now, the final touches. Where's Albert? He just went down to talk to Mr. Morris about the security arrangement for the day. Yes, we have a very hectic schedule. [Aunt Belle screams] [Aunt Belle gasping] [bodyguard 1] What is happening to you? [bodyguard 2] What's wrong with you? Call the doctor! Call the doctor! [squeals] [Aunt Belle] I can't breathe. [bodyguard 2] What's the matter with you, ma'am? What's the matter? Okay, okay. -[gasping] -Get some water, quick. [bodyguard 1] It's okay, madam. You'll be fine. [Aunt Belle panting] Madam! Madam! Here! Your water is here. [Aunt Belle gasping] [maid gasps] Oh, I'm sorry, Ms. Thompson. I didn't see you coming. Is there anything I can do for you? Well, if you need anything, just let me know. Good morning, Ms. Thompson. Have security arrangements been made for today? Yes, ma'am. I'll just be in the café for a breakfast meeting. Make sure you are all ready by the time the princess comes out. [Albert] Yes, ma'am. Elevator! Hold the elevator! [man] All right. Okay. See you tonight. -So what, dude? -Let's take a break. [indistinct chattering] -[guard 1] What's your schedule? -[guard 2] Graveyard shift. -[woman] Oh! -Hey! I'm on duty until tomorrow. [woman] Goodness, watch where you're going. [guard 1] Let's help her. [guard 2] Excuse me. Ms. Thompson... Can I help you? I'll be in the café. Make sure everything is ready. Okay. Good morning, Ms. Thompson. I'm glad you're a bit too... Ms. Thompson! We're supposed to meet at... -Ms. Thompson! -Mr. Garcia. Mr. Garcia. Let's get down to business. But... It's Ms. Thompson! Ma'am, excuse me! [reporters clamoring] Ms. Thompson, Ms. Thompson! She's not available. She's... Sorry, she's not available. Sorry, I'm sorry. [elevator dings] -Ms. Thompson? -Yes? Life sure is funny sometimes, right? You swore off all responsibilities in the past, yet here you are... What do you know about raising a kid? I don't know. Why did you say yes? What do you want me to do? Bring my mother back from the dead and argue with her? Come on, it's already noon. Josie, we're leaving. Alex, are you sure you don't want to eat? It's okay. Thanks. -All right. -Love, I'll get going. All right, take care. Don't forget to pick up the wedding ring we ordered. Yeah. Take care of the invitations, all right? -Yeah. -Bye. I'll go ahead. Alex, take care! Raising a kid's expensive, man. I'm almost done paying Mister Kanor for the jeep. Come to think of it, we all have problems anyway. In my case, I'm neck-deep in debt. Weddings are so expensive. Who's to blame for that? You chose to get married in the province. That's a lot of people to feed. Anyway, I just need one big scoop to break even. A reporter must be vigilant. You and Josie do nothing but sleep all day. [scoffs] You're just jealous. You know, you should get married so you'll have someone to take care of you and your brother. Get married? I don't have time for women. Stay here. Is there any news? We checked all the entrances and no one has seen her. Where could she be? I should never have left her. Oh lord, we're going to be in big trouble. What are we going to do? Call the king. Who will call? You're her chief of security. Yes. And you're her personal secretary and aide. But it's your responsibility to guard the princess. You're the one who's supposed to be keeping track of her. We do guard the princess. It's you and your men who should be with her at all times. You know where she is, you're supposed to be with her! It's not my responsibility. I can't be at every place-- If you call the king, you'll both lose your jobs. Listen. Hey! -Yes, sir? -This is what we need to do. Check the wardrobe. See if there are any clothes missing. [chief of security] Check the doors and see if anybody tried to force their way in. Make sure that no one finds out about the princess. -I'll take care of it. Manny. -Yes sir. [man] So, what really happened? [Ms. Thompson] I just attended a breakfast meeting. Hang that up! My men will take care of it. -But Ms. Thompson-- -Now! [Ms. Thompson] She disappeared like that. What are we gonna do about her one o'clock appointment? Oh, that girl! Where is she?! [squeals] How pretty! [giggling] [vendor] Miss, miss... -You buy balloons? -Yes, I like that! Alms. Please have mercy on me. [Ella giggling] Alms... Here. Wait, wait, wait! Go eat something. [in Spanish] Poor kids. [kids clamoring] Me too, miss! Me too! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Here. Here's for you. Here. Here. [Brix] You can pull over here. All right. I'll get going. Where's your payment? Oh. I thought it was a free ride. Not when I'm on duty. Besides, I always pay for your drinks. -All right, man. -Take care. Paolo, move here. [Alex] Baclaran! Plenty of room! Hurry! Baclaran! Baclaran! Plenty of room! Baclaran! Baclaran! Baclaran! Baclaran! Six seats left! Here's my payment. [gasps] Look at that woman. She keeps smiling at me. Is she nuts or what? Hey, miss! Yes? You lost? No. I have found. Found? What's this woman talking about? I'm starving. -Are you new here? -Yes. My brother Alex is hungry. You have to tell us where you want to go. Alex... Yes. It's lunch time now and we are going to eat. -Eat? Yes, I'm hungry too. -She wants to eat too. Hey, she might be expecting a restaurant. We're just going to a sidewalk eatery. We will not eat in a restaurant. Just in a sidewalk eatery. Yes. You know, turo-turo. Where you point at the food you want. Turo-turo. That would be nice. Anywhere. Let's just take her with us. She seems lost. Unbelievable. Come. Here's your order. -Mameng! -That's delicious. Alex! I cooked your favorite! -Vegetable soup! Come in! -Okay! -Who are they? -This one's my brother. This one, I don't know. Oh, come on! I bet she's your girlfriend. Just a passenger who wants to eat. Oh, a tourist. Lots of tourists eat here. Miss! Miss! Miss! Choose, choose, choose. Um... Point at what you want. Turo-turo. [Mameng] Which? Which? Which? Which? You? -I'll have this. -Adobo. You? -What? -Anything. Okay. Give her this. -Baby crabs? -Yes. Dig in. Eat. Eat. What is this? Crabs. Baby crabs. You know? Baby crabs. Specialty Filipino food. First, you open the door. -Shell. -I know. Shell. Okay? And then you dip it in vinegar. There. Vinegar. Like that. Then, divided by two... One, you eat. Like that. And then, rice. Okay? Then the other one, you eat also. Like that. Understood? I'll try. Okay. I don't think she's used to eating this sort of food. It might make her sick. Let her be. [TV announcer] Please stand by for this ABS-CBN News update. Want some more? [Kata] From the ABS-CBN News headquarters, I am Kata Inocencio. Thank you. You have great food here. Oh? I like this woman, Alex. [Mameng giggling] [Paolo] Have some crab fat. Paolo! Hurry up! Meanwhile, the princess of Bavaria, Princess Marinella dela Vega will not be able to join the activities prepared for the royalties visiting the country for the International Year of the Child. Get her payment! Pay for it first. Charge her later. Mameng, how much? [Ella] But I don't have money. -What? What do you mean? -What? What no money? Well, I don't have money because I gave it all to them. The little poor children. -You gave away your money? -What? You gave away money? Yes. My dollars. Because they're very, very poor, and hungry. -Dollars? Dollars? -Mm-hm. Dollars. This woman's pissing me off. You have no money? Then you go. But my home is with you. -What was that? -She wants to live with you. Live with me? What is she talking about? Don't you hear the music, Alex? What music? No music. You see? No radio. Is she pulling our leg? Hey, no more jokes. You have no money, then you go. Go! Scram! Or else I'll call the police. [gasps] So you've found him. But why do you sound so sad? Because he sent me away. -He did? -Yes. He doesn't believe me. I mean, he doesn't believe about the music. My dear child, be patient. It may take some time before he hears with his heart. But he will. I just hope he does before it's time for you to return. -Papa? -No, he hasn't been told yet. And I'm not sure how long we can delay this. Are you sure you're okay? Don't worry. I'll find myself a place. What if she gets kidnapped? Or raped? Or murdered? Poor woman. Don't start with me, Paolo. I'm not rich. How am I supposed to feed her? Too bad. She seemed really nice. Nice? More like crazy. Go buy sardines from Terya's store. Tell her to put it on my tab. Hurry up before the store closes. You talk too much. [man] Toast! Toast! Toast! [man 2] This one's okay. Drink the whole glass. Come on! [man 3] You can do it. [man] Bottoms up. -The whole glass? -All the way. All the way. -Okay. -Come on. [man 2] Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah! [men cheering] [man] That's good. That's good. That's good. Alex! -Okay, one more shot. -No, no, no. -No, no. -[man] You can do it! Only one more, okay? Then I'll bring you to your house, okay? But I don't have a house here. [man] Wow, man! No house here? -[man] What did she say? -[man 2] She doesn't have... I don't know. Somewhere. I have a house. I'll bring you there, okay? Oh, you people are really kind. -Okay, one more toast. -Toast! Toast! [men singing] ♪ My dear ♪ ♪ I miss you so much ♪ ♪ I wish we were together ♪ [singing continues] That's enough. Hey, let's go. -Hey! -She's with me. With you? We found her. Leave her alone. Miss Beautiful, do you know him? Oh, him? Yeah. He's my hero. He's... I wanna be with him. [men chattering] That's his girlfriend. -You all lose. -You lose! -You bastard! -Hey, I was just kidding. Don't put sugar in it. It'll worsen her buzz. Of all the jeepneys in the Philippines, why did it have to be mine? Now she's my responsibility. Hey, wake her up! Miss... Miss... She's awake. Hold on. Ms. Thompson, you cut your hair. -What was that? -She said Ms. Thompson. Thompson? What's that? What a day. You may undress me now. She wants her clothes taken off. I'll do it. Okay. -All right, I'll do it myself. -Hey! Hey! Hey! You! No burlesque shows here. No. No. What are you doing? -Getting a shirt. -No! No! That won't fit her. Get one from my room. No! No. Hurry up! No! Hurry up! Hurry! Aunt Belle, it's Alex. It's Alex. What a disgrace! This is a great shame to our country. It's worse than that. This is bad. Now, she couldn't have just disappeared. Maybe she was kidnapped. But which force? The communists, the Muslim rebels, or just plain kidnappers? That's what we need to find out. I've instructed all local and regional commanders to conduct a thorough search. I've ordered my men to put up checkpoints in all provincial exit points. The public must not know. We should not cause panic. There should be a news blackout. Ms. Thompson, we should come out with a public announcement that the princess is sick. The President is very disappointed. At all costs, we must get that princess alive. Alive?! Hey! Look here. The Philippines has many tourist spots. That's entertainment. Go to those places. No entertainment here. Nothing. You should go home. But I wanna stay here with you. I came here because of you. Me? Why me? My goodness, what is she talking about? Because with you, I heard the music. Good grief. Music again! Music! Alex, listen to your heart, please. Hey, no more jokes! Or you'll go home! But I cannot go home. I don't have my passport with me. She can't leave the Philippines without her passport. Please don't get mad at me, Alex. Okay, okay. You win again. I surrender. You stay. [giggles] Hey! Hey! No touch! You'll stay here only for a short time. Then you'll call your father, mother, brother, sister to... For your passport. You'll stay here without pay. So you'll work. Work. You know work? Uh-huh. [Ella giggling] My goodness! [Ella] This is so exciting! This is fun, Paolo. This is so much fun, Paolo. [indistinct chattering] -Oh, hi, neighbors! -[all] Hi! [Ella] How are you? [Minda] Miss! Miss! -You live with Alex? -Oh, yes, I live here. [indistinct chattering] They look good together, right? Ra-- Rag. Your Papa? No, it's Alex's father. -But I thought... -One mother, different fathers. Oh. Paolo... Let me fix this. Alex will get mad. [Minda] Hey, order some snacks, will you? At least buy snacks to go with those beers. Minda! Any food left? -Yeah. -Adobo. Okay. Alex, when will we get a sip of that hot soup? I have no plans of getting married yet. -Minda, put it on my list. -Anything for you, Alex. Come on! You're already living together. We just want to know -when the wedding will be. -Wedding? Word around here is that you're already living with her. What? Alex... Out! -I'm sorry. -Go out! Go out! -Alex let me explain! -Out! Out! Get out! -Alex, please! -Enough! I've done nothing but... You know... I work. Every day. Morning, afternoon, and evening. So I can have money. You know, money! To have money so I can buy all this! You see? I bought all this! You? You said you want to stay. I said yes. But what did you do now? Look at what you did! We're just wasting each other's time! You're so stupid! -I'm not stupid. -You understood that? You're not stupid? Then what's this? My things! You destroyed them piece by piece! They have sentimental value to me! -Please don't scream at me. -I'm mad! That's why I'm shouting at you! You disturb the peace and order in this neighborhood! And you tell people that we're... That we're living together. But they asked me if I live here and I said yes. But not like that. Never! You're crying again. Stop crying. Enough! I said... Out! Get out! Okay. I'll go. Go out. -Ella, don't leave me, Ella! -No! You stay here! [rooster crowing] This job is exhausting. When will that princess get better? Time and effort is wasted just for an interview. And the people around her treat us like we're nothing. Two noodle soups, miss. And all because we work for tabloids. When will this world change? Well, at least some things have changed. Who'd have thought you could convince Sare to teach that woman? That whale's head over heels in love with you. How'd you convince her? Hey! Hey! What's wrong with you? Dude... Never mind. [hoots] You've got it bad, huh? Stop pretending. Me? No. Of course not. Me? [Brix] Dude, just admit it. You like her, don't you? [Sare] One, two, one, two. Like that. You do it. One, two... All right. There. Press down harder. Harder. Make sure it's scrubbed well. There. Scrub it. One, two... Scrub. Scrub. One, two... One, two... [Sare] One, two... There. Move your feet like that. Just like that, until the floor is shiny. Find the spots with stains on them. There, scrub them. See? It's so easy. I bet by tomorrow you'll be the one teaching me. Ah! I'll help. No, it's okay, thank you. I can do it by myself. [groans] Alex asked me to teach you how to buy from the market. Now listen, because I have no patience. Just once, no repeat performance. Follow me, okay? Follow. These are string beans. -String beans. -String beans. -String beans. -Yes. This is an eggplant. -"Jump"? -No, not "jump". -Eggplant. -[Ella whispers] "Eggplant"... Two eggplants. A long eggplant and a short eggplant. Okay? Miss. Miss, here. You like sampaguita? -Uhm... -Good smell. -Uhm. How much? -Ten pesos only. Fabulous, right? I chose well. Come, come, come. Looks sexy, right? It goes well with her figure. Perfect, right? I bought three more of those. One hundred eighty each. I won't overcharge you. [Sare] Ella, let's go! This is a stove. -Hm... -You know, a stove. A stove. Left turn, there's fire. -Right turn, no fire. -Uh-huh... Middle, stoplight. Okay? -Okay. -Okay. Now you give me the vegetables. -Uhm... Vegetables! -Vegetables. Okay. -Now you put some here... -Uh-huh. Then, some more. And then, you put all these together. Okay? Do it. Then you wait for... Uh... What do you call that? The... Tiny bubbles! -Huh? You mean, boil? -Yes! Wait until it boils. -Okay, faster. Put them all in. -Uh-huh. -Delicious? Okay? -Delicious. [chuckles] You should smile more often, Alex. Can I play with Jackson after eating? When you're done eating, wash your plate then clean the jeepney. Okay. Why are you so rough on Paolo? It's nighttime, but he still wants to play? No. -But he has time to work? -No talking. Eat. [Alex exhales] Uhm... Passport? [sighs] Yeah, my aunt will fix it. Uh... When are you leaving? Soon. Good. Yeah, good. [people clamoring] [man] Here's another one. -Thank you. -Let me help you. -Minda. -Hey, Brix! Brix, this is Alex's friend. -This is Brix. -You must be Ella. -Hi! Nice to meet you. -Hi! I'm Brix. [Brix] By the way... I'm getting married this Saturday. You can come along with Alex. -Oh, really? -That's wonderful, thank you. Thank you very much. -[Brix] Is Alex in? [Ella] Uhm... Yeah, he's there. There you are. Dude, I invited her to my wedding. Hey, I'm going to the wedding. She's leaving soon! So grumpy. Paolo, that's enough. I'm off. Hey. Wash the dishes upstairs, okay? It's a mess. Can we go to the fair in a town across the river? You can't leave. -But-- -I said no. It's not safe there. Stay here. Besides, the collector for the electricity might come by today. [engine revving] No. Alex is nice. You know... he's a nice guy. He may be mad today, but he'll be nice again tomorrow. But, Sare, he is always mad at me and Paolo. No, Alex is a nice guy, really. He's been breaking his back working since he was a kid. You see, Alex's mother? She eloped with Paolo's father. You know... she went away with... Paolo's father. Paolo's father... Alex's mother... That's why even as a kid, Alex had to work, work, work, work, work. Lonely. Alex's father, he cried and cried and died. So, Alex is Mr. Lonely and Mr. Angry. Both. Got it? Uh... Miss Sare, are we riding the caterpillar? Yes, but we'll do it later tonight. The fair isn't open yet. And I have to collect money from Kanuto first. Don't worry, I got you. You'll enjoy tonight, birthday boy. [Paolo] Miss Sare, let's go here! Right here! [Ella] Wait for us, Paolo. [Sare] Look, Paolo! Over there! Let's go there! [Paolo] Let's go! Sir, give us coins worth five pesos. You, throw! Throw! [Ella giggles] You won! You won! -Ella! Ella, he won! -Yay! -I won! -[Ella shrieks] [Sare cheers] -I want to ride here! -That one? All right. Follow the leader! Let's go! Come on, Ella, let's go! -[Ella] Let's go! Let's go! -[man] One ticket, sir. [Sare] Here are our tickets, sir. [Paolo] Okay. [men singing] [men chattering] [woman giggling] -[man] Hey look! It's Alex! -Alex, come drink with us. -Alex, wanna toast? -Have you seen Ella and Paolo? They went to the fair, across the river. Have something to eat. What would you like? -Ice cream? Cake? -[man] Stay a while. You don't drink, right? Letter B, number ten! I have it! [giggles] -You have one? -Yes! -[man] Letter N, number 45! -[Ella giggles] -[cheers] -[Ella] I have that too! -There. -You got another one, Paolo. -Look after my card. -Okay. I'll just collect money from Kanuto. I'll be back. [Paolo] Ella, I'm winning! How about you? [man] Letter I, number 28! -[Ella giggles] -[Paolo] I'm winning! -Yes! -Paolo! Come here! Didn't I tell you not to leave the house -when I'm not around? -Alex, please. Please. -Don't talk back at me. -Enough! Enough! -You're really making me mad. -Can you just... [shouts] Shut up, I'm not talking to you! [Paolo sobbing] Alex, how could you?! I've got no patience left for you. You've given me nothing but headaches! -I don't understand! -I don't care! I'm mad! -We're going home! -Alex! Your mother and father spoiled you. I told you to be content with what we have. -[Paolo] Brother... -Why won't you listen? -You should be disciplined! -Brother, please... -Brother, don't! -[Alex grunting] -Alex, no! -Stop it! Stop it! Stay out of this. [Alex] Paolo! [Alex shouts] Paolo! -Alex. Please leave him alone! -Paolo! [Ella pants] [gasps] [grunts] This is my house. I will do whatever I want! -I don't understand you. -[shouts] I don't care! You shouted at me then pushed me. You keep butting in! What do you know? -I'm his brother! -But then, why do you hurt him? Hurt? I discipline! Because he's stubborn! He's hardheaded! I'm punishing him so he won't do it again. Then you, you keep meddling! You're nothing to me and you're nothing to Paolo! But I love him and I care for him! He's just lonely, Alex. -He needs you. -You don't know anything! Shut up! I know you blame him for your mother's mistakes. [shouts] Shut up! You don't know anything about my life. I grew up alone. No mother or father. I worked, and worked, and worked. All by myself. I have nothing! Nothing. Paolo... Paolo had everything. -I had nothing! -But you're the same now. -He has no one but you. -You don't understand! I'm mad! But you're always mad, Alex! You're such a lonely and angry person. Whenever people are happy, you just get mad because you want them to be sad like you! You want everybody to pay for your sadness, your miseries. Even Paolo! You always hurt him instead of loving him. Love? You say you love Paolo. Why, are you staying here for good? No. You'll leave tomorrow or the day after. What will happen to Paolo when you leave? What about us? You say you love Paolo, but you're leaving us? So don't you dare lecture me, because you're the ungrateful one! You put all sorts of things in Paolo's head. [stammers] You just want to enjoy. You're a bad influence! All you do is waste money. I work and work, while you? You want to spend and spend my money. We did not spend your money. Sare treated us because it's Paolo's birthday. You know... I see myself in you. I was your age when Mama left me. But it's okay... I understand her. [Paolo sniffs] You see... They kept fighting... Because of money. They were so different. My father loved helping others. But when it comes to his family... He gave nothing. He told us to be content with nothing. She said that you're a good person. That you look just like her. [Alex scoffs] I don't know. She always remembered you. During Christmas... Your birthday... Her birthday. She left me. She said she'll take me with her... But she never came back. I was alone, Paolo. My father died. You're lucky. Maybe that's why I treat you this way. Because you're lucky. Uhm... I'm sorry for the things I said.

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. [Priest] And I, by the authority of the church, pronounce you husband and wife. You may now kiss the bride. I really like it here. I like this. Every time I go to Brix's place... I always go to the beach to think. Yes, it's beautiful. Hey. Wait. Get one, for your wish. [Alex] Go get one, then make a wish. [Ella] What? This is like a wishing sea. Like a... wishing well. -Uh-huh. -You throw one at the sea... But you make a wish first. Then you keep one. And your wish is granted. -I can make a wish? -Yes! [sighs] [giggles] Why? You're my only love. I was scared before. For me, you are all the same. My mother, other girls... They all leave me. I gave my love to them, and then another man will get their heart. And I'm alone again... I will never leave you. I love you, Ella. What's taking Alex so long? Don't worry, he'll be here soon. [Alex] Ella! -Ella! Paolo! -Brother! Ella, Paolo, we own the jeepney now! -It's ours! -Really? We're rich? [Ella giggles] -Alex, we're rich? -Yes! -[Paolo laughs] -We own the jeepney now. -Really? That's wonderful! -Yeah! Bro, is Ella really leaving? Yes, we've talked about it. But once she comes back, we'll get married right away. It's that simple. You know, you've changed a lot. [Alex sighs] I guess I've really changed. Even I can barely recognize myself. I guess that's what love does to you. You know, Ella's different. She has everything I've been looking for. I thought a woman like that only exists in my dreams. But now that I've found what I've been looking for... She'll be the first and last woman I will love. Bro, you're so cheesy now! What? -[scoffs] Cheesy? -[Paolo chuckles] Who's cheesy? -Who? Who's cheesy? -[Paolo laughs] [people clamoring] [Reporter] Excuse me, sir. -When can we see the princess? -No comment. -Is she sick? -No comment. -Sorry. Sorry. No interview. -We're just asking a question. [man] What's going on? We've been waiting all morning. I'm sure there's a problem. Why would the king suddenly come here? Maybe he's just fetching his daughter. I heard the princess is in critical condition. -Maybe she's dying. -That's impossible. -[sirens wailing] -Here they come. [man] Excuse me! Excuse me! Make way! Get out of the way! Excuse me! [man] Please step back! Step back. -See what you've done? -You're responsible for this. [Ms. Thompson] Good morning, Your Highness. Your Majesty, it's so nice to see you. Your suite is all ready. [people clamoring] How could you? I don't believe you're so incompetent. -What a bunch of snobs. -Yeah. We didn't get anything. I got one. -Did we get a picture? -Just a few shots. This one's really something. -Are you sure about that? -Of course. All right. Have those photos edited right away for our report. -[man] Okay? -Leave this to me. Dude, can I borrow this? [Brix] Alex! Alex! Alex, I've been looking all over for you. Brix. Come join me. No. Dude, do you know how rich Ella is? Rich? Dude, you're living with a real-life princess. She's Princess Marinella of Bavaria. Her father came here because she's been missing. Dude, we're talking big money here. We've hit the jackpot, man! What if we pretend that we kidnapped her? Imagine how much ransom money we'll get. Or we can say that she got lost and we took her in. Of course, they'll give us a reward. Leave. -What? -Leave. You're not using Ella for money. Dude, you don't understand. This is our chance to get rich. This is a huge scoop. Dude, I need the money. This would mean a promotion for me. I have a wife now! -Find another way to earn money. -What? Dude, why? Because you're in love with that princess? Snap out of it! She's a princess and you're a jeepney driver! You're too ambitious! [Brix grunts] [gasps] You're a princess. Why did you lie? No. I did not lie, Alex. Why didn't you tell us? You would not have accepted and loved me. It's so lonely there, Alex. Please understand. I don't want to be a princess. I want to be your wife. Please, Alex, I want to marry you! Enough. [Ella sobs] Tomorrow morning... you're leaving. Alex. Thank you so much for everything. Tell Sare I said goodbye. Ella. [sobs] [sniffs] -I failed, Aunt Belle. -Oh no, you did not. You heard the music. But we did not end up together. [inhales] End? Ella it has not ended yet. It won't end until your love for each other is gone. I love him so much, that I'm willing to give up everything for him. Oh, Ella... All I want is to be happy. And now that I've found the man who can give me that happiness... I lost him. As long as Alex loves you, you will never lose him. Let's go to sleep. It's late. You've been fretting since you've been back. Forget about him. He's a commoner. Make sure you do your duties right this time. You've already shamed your country. [in Spanish] Yes, Papa. Oh, Carlos, don't be so rough on Ella. She's so different from Margarita. She's always been a disappointment to me. But you never tried to understand her. -All she wanted was to be happy. -She has everything. She's a princess. What more could she ask for? Oh, Carlos. Happiness is not living in a palace... or wearing expensive gowns, or traveling to different cities. Happiness is being able to share your life with someone you love. [Aunt Belle] Please, Carlos. I would like to thank all of you for bearing with me during the time that I was sick. In the past five days that I have been toured around, I have seen the beauty of your country. What time is it? It's time for you to follow the princess. -She's leaving today. -Brother... After an hour, we'll never see Ella again. I can also say that the Philippines is a home of beautiful, warm and smiling people. What time is it? Alex, if you want to follow Ella, then let's go. [Sare] We've got thirty minutes left. You know, you're the problem. The problem is we're from different worlds. But the one thing that I enjoyed... and the one thing that touched me the most is meeting the orphans. You see, I also lost my mother when I was young. Hey, it's Ella! Bro, it's Ella! I have learned so much from you. [Ella] You have touched my heart and you have changed my life. And for this, I sincerely thank you. I feel so sad that I have to leave. I hope and pray that someday we will see each other again. You have become part of me and I will never forget you. [in Filipino] Please don't forget me. [in Filipino] I love you all. Again, we would like to thank the King and Princess Marinella of Bavaria... for gracing this convention and generously donating $100,000 to the Children's Foundation. We wish you a safe trip and we hope you'll visit our country again. [shouts] Ella! -[Paolo] Ella! -Paolo! [Paolo] Ella! Ella! Let's go. The plane is waiting, Your Highness. Ella! No! Do not disgrace our family in front of all these people! I'm sorry, Papa. I love him.
