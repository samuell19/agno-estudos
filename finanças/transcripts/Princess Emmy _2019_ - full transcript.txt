[upbeat music] [narrator] Once upon a time in the land of Kandis, a princess named Carlotta saved a herd of horses from plunging over a cliff, but just as the horses stopped, the edge of the cliff gave way, and Carlotta fell. When she awoke, she found to her astonishment that she could understand what the horses were saying. It was a gift, a reward for her bravery and kindness. Back at her castle, Carlotta wrote a magical book and through this book, the talking gift passed to future generations, but Carlotta added a warning. The book must never be lost, for if it were, the gift itself would be lost... forever. [dramatic music] -[high tinkle] -[clock ticks] [high tinkle] [high tinkle] -[horses neigh] -[girl cheering] Come on, Caesar! Move, Johnny! Catch up, Valentine! And you, Xaver. Hurry up, Joan. -[laughs] -[horses cheer] Come on, faster, run faster. [birds tweeting] -[Emmy] You know, Caesar. -[Caesar] Mm? Whatever we do, it just feels like you always let me win... [Caesar laughs] ...it's not fair and it's boring. What are you moaning about? I thought you liked winning. But if the rest of you don't try, it doesn't count. [laughs] You're a princess, Emmy. We're supposed to let you win. You should treat me just like any other girl. Of course, a girl like any other. Who just happens to wear a crown? And lives in a huge gigantic castle? -With servants and... -So, from now on we're allowed to beat ya? [laughs] And you promise not to whine like humans usually do when they lose? I'm losing, I'm losing. That sounds absolutely nothing like-- -[screams] -[thud] Ouch. Black flip with a double twist. Very fancy. I'll double twist you. No, no tickling! [laughs] Right then, let's have a real challenge and we'll see who the whiny babies are. Super, count me in. -Last one back's a donkey. -[horses cheer] Wait, that's cheating! Come on, Caesar. Ha ha. Caesar. This isn't fair. Well, I could do it this way. Or is this any good? -[laughs] -Bad Caesar, bad horse. Whoa! -[people chattering] -[camera clicks] [woman] Real excitement and a tremendous sense of anticipation here as Professor Croupe prepares to read the parchment to the waiting crowd. For years we debated the origins of this ancient parchment. Was it really a page from Carlotta's book? Or merely some trifle from the past written in some long-forgotten strange tongue. My friends, we now have the answer, for last night, under cover of darkness, the parchment underwent a most remarkable transformation. Uh... which as you will see-- Huh? It's gone, the page is gone! -[church bells chime] -[birds chirping] [horns honk] Hmm. Huh? [gasps] Hmm. David? Gizana? Gizana! Wouldn't this be perfect for the Princess Day Ball? -It's lovely. -Now hurry up and try it on. Hmm. [grunts] [grunts] Hello, your highness, so glad you could join us. I'd have got here sooner if it wasn't for certain horses cheating. Who, us? Not you. Caesar. I may not have run my fastest, but then you did say we should treat you just like any other girl. Oh, I see. It's a conspiracy. You wanted to hear me whine. -[bell dings] -Shh. -Hi, guys. -[Emmy] David! Where've you been all day? Up in the mountains. And I'd have been first back if Caesar hadn't cheated. Wouldn't I? [blows raspberry] [laughs] They don't seem to agree. Who are you gonna believe? Me or them? Anyway, shouldn't you be at work? I would be, if this hadn't practically landed on my head. [gasps] The page from Carlotta's book? -You didn't steal it, did you? -Course not. I'm simply returning it to its rightful-- -Oh. -[gasps] Whoa, that's weird. [David] Totally. I'm glad to be rid of it. Well, I've got work to do. Oh, by the way, I just saw your cousin in town. Little Miss Perfect. [Emmy gasps] -[bell dings] -Gizana. Hmm. -[gasps] -[horses whinny] [both] Hmm. [grunting] [gasps] [Caesar] Now that really is weird. Hmm. -[gasps] -What is it? [gasps] Huh? You know, back when I was in the military-- [Ceasar] Hey, shh. Where's Emmy? Where's she gone? Hmm. -[door scrapes] -[grunts] -[water drips] -[high tinkle] [gasps] Oh! [Carlotta] Emmy, pass the test and show yourself worthy of the gift. At Carlotta's tower, you shall meet your fate. Who fails the test will lose the gift. [high swoosh] Do they mean the talking gift? I thought I could only lose it if I lost Carlotta's book. I'd go and take a look at that book if I was you. Very close look. [gasps] [upbeat music] [owl hooting] [panting] [grunts] [sighs] Huh? -[high whisper] -[high tinkle] [Carlotta] At Carlotta's tower, you shall meet your fate. [Emmy] Well, I guess this shows us how to get there, hey, horsey? I'll go tomorrow, which means we have to get up early. Very early. [alarm beeps] Ah, I slept in! [panting] -Mum wants a word with you. -Not now, Moritz. -What about? -Zip. Hmm, brothers. Mom, what's this all about? I'm in a hurry. Mom? Dad, have you seen Mom? Oh, no, Dad's been making muffins again. -[cat meows] -[muffin whizzes] [lips smack] Mom. Mom. Sweetheart, do you know what this room is? Clean? Empty? Yes, for now. But in ten days' time, this will be your stage. A stage for my little princess to finally make her debut in society. -The Princess Day Ball. -Hmm? The Council of Elders have asked us to hold it here in the castle this year. And you've been invited, Emmy. Your first ever Princess Day Ball. Oh, what? [chuckles] You'd better start preparing. Remember, you only have ten days to get ready. And we have a surprise for you. What do you think? -Whoa. -[dramatic music] It's beautiful. You're not dreaming, go on. Wow, my dress. My Princess Day dress. Oh, Mom, that's so wonderful. But, um, but please, I have to be going. Aren't you excited? I really am, but I've got ten days, right? -That's loads of time. -Oh, no. The time will just fly by with -Frau Zwickelmeier. -Frau Zwickelmeier? Moritz, stop it, it's gonna be wonderful. Oh, there she is. What a happy day! Oh, I can't wait to see you in that dress! Ah, young lady, aren't you wondering who your Master of Manners will be? You mean you? [scoffs] No, I excel at many things. Ooh, oops, not least baking. But etiquette isn't one of them. You'll receive your instruction from Vincenzo Massimo Cerimonata. -[Karl] Muffin anyone? -Maybe later. Uh, I've just brushed my teeth. Really? Can I please leave now? -I have to-- -Not so fast. You have to pass certain tests before attending the ball. [Karl] Prove you're posh enough. [laughs] Well, we wouldn't want to let the side down. No, not in front of all those la-di-das from the other kingdoms. And if I don't pass? Of course you'll pass. You're an exceptional young lady. Really? You really think so? Yes, absolutely. Now, let's celebrate with a muffin. Oh, I uh, I've got this thing I have to do, I'll be back soon. -What thing? -I'll tell ya later. -Ah, whoa. -Sorry. -Emmy. -Won't be long! Yeah! [panting] -[knocking] -Sorry! [man] Huh? Attenzione. Atten-- -Whoa! -[cat meows] [thud] [cat purrs] [speaks in foreign language] Sebastian, can I saddle up Caesar? He's all yours, Emmy! Emmy? The Principessa? [speaks in foreign language] There's something else I need to tell you. [Emmy] Tell me later. Love you, Mom! -La Mama? -[Karla] My goodness, what happened? Please, let me help you. Your majesty, Vincenzo Massimo Cerimonata. Welcome, Senor Cerimonata. I am most humbly at your service, ma'am. Please do come in and please accept my apologies. Emmy's terribly excited. Oh, I'm sure Mr. Vincenzo knows what naughty little monkeys children are. He does, and he will do his utmost to make this child a lady. Oh, your highness, you are a cook. Amateur. Advanced amateur. Uh... Please, take one. Oh, Mr. Vincenzo, let me show you to your room. Whoa. Look at that, didn't spill a crumb. Did you see that, Mr... Please, let me show this young man to his room. Thank you, Fionnuala. [Fionnuala] You'll be sleeping in our finest guest room. Madam, I expected no less. My name's Fionnuala, by the way. You think Emmy's ready for the Princess Day Ball? For the Ball, yes. For Mr. Outstanding, -I have my royal doubts. -[laughs] Karl. Shh. Don't. [Fionnuala] And if there's anything you need, you just let me know. And we have a ghost, you know. Right here in the castle. [speaks in foreign language] [Fionnuala] That lot don't believe in it, but I've seen things. [soft music] [birds squawk] [gasps] I think we've found what you're looking for. -[Caesar neighs] -Steady, boy, steady. [gasps] [bird squawks] [Caesar] This test the voices talked about... you reckon you'll discover what it is? Up there? Only one way to find out. Xaver, you're in charge while we're gone. Let's move, hop hop. -[horse neighs] -Whoa, whoa, whoa. We haven't discussed tactics yet. Plans, plan Bs. You know, when I was in the army-- -Please, Xaver. -Do give it a rest. Fine, don't blame me when the whole thing goes belly up. [dramatic music] Hmm. Whoa. -[high tinkle] -Whoa. [Caesar] Amazing. Wow. [inspirational music] Come on. [horse hooves clatter] Whoa. -[high whine] -[horses whinny] [dramatic music] -[gasps] -[Carlotta] Who are you? I'm Emmy, I've come about the test. [Carlotta] Who are you? Are you worthy of the gift? -[slow music] -[horse hooves clatter] Emmy? It's getting late. [Carlotta] Are you worthy? -[bells tinkle] -[cars rumble] -[horn blares] -[birds cry] [David] Are you worthy of the gift? I didn't know what to say. How should I know if I'm worthy? Well, we know there's gonna be some kind of test. Maybe it's the Princess Day Ball. Don't you have to pass a bunch of silly tests before they even let you go? If you do lose the talking gift-- not that you will, obviously, but if you did-- can I have it? -Ha ha, very funny. -No. [laughs] Moritz, put that skateboard away! [Karl sighs] That thing's an absolute menace. [Fionnuala] Moritz! [grunts] Horsey, if this test is the Princess Day Ball, I reckon it's in the bag. -[car rumbles] -[horn blares] [tires screech] [upbeat music] [tuts] Hello, Frau Zwickelmeier. Maurice, did I teach you nothing? Chin up, up, up. One's head is always kept high. And when you did you last have a haircut? Ask your parents to invest in one as a matter or urgency. Would you close the door behind me, please, Maurice? -It's Moritz. -Hello? Frau Zwickelmeier has arrived. Princess Emmy? Hello? Would the princess be in the ballroom perhaps? Can someone please help me find the Kleine Prinzessin? Is somebody going somewhere? -That's what I wanted to tell you. -Hmm. We're going to have a house guest. A house guest? She's up in your room as we speak. Your cousin, Gizana. [dramatic music] [growls] [gasps] Hello, Emmy, I'm just throwing out some trash. What trash? My dear cousin, as far as I can see, it's all trash, but I couldn't throw it all out, so I started with the baby trash. What? This is my room, it's none of your business. Well, it is my business if it's cluttering up my bed. -That's my bed. -It was, till I got here. Guests come first, and that's how it's gonna be until the Ball. What? We're sharing the Ball now too. If you can pass all your classes of course. Shame really. Squeezing you into this tiny room, when there's such a beautiful big one upstairs. -Show me. -If you insist. Take me there. [Emmy] Ta-da! Look, your new room. Charming, huh? And spacious. It certainly is. [Gizana] I'm surprised you haven't taken it yourself. [Emmy] Let's talk straight, shall we? Absolutely. I can't stop you being here, but you'd better keep your distance. And what distance would that be? This far? How about now? Just say when. [sighs] -So you brought me to an arena. -What? A battlefield with winners and losers. Are you testing me? [chuckles] Please, you wouldn't stand a chance. Don't bet on it. No? [screams] [gasps] Ta-da. Girls, what's wrong? What happened? And what on Earth are you doing up here anyway? Emmy just showed me my new room. [Karla] Emmy. I thought she'd enjoy the extra space. This is no time for jokes. Gizana, maybe you can explain. It was a shock to me, too, Auntie. The Princess Emmy has a point, senora. Look at it, the room is practically royal. In fact, I think Emmy should have it herself as a reward for her generosity. [Karla] I think that's a very good idea. You can move your things in after dance class. Which begins in approximately ten minutes ago. -But, Mom... -[Karla] Emmy. I'm going, I'm going. [cat meows] [groans] [panting] Emmy, what happened? [Emmy] I've got a new room. [Zwickelmeier] Ah-ha, at last. Entre, entre. What is this, a frightened rabbit? A princess strides into the room. Yes, Frau Zwickelmeier. So, down to work. All dancing starts with counting. It might seem odd, but one who cannot count, cannot dance. So, are we ready? Yes, I am. We begin with the waltz. One, two, three, one, two, three. Together, one, two, three. -One, two, three. -One, two, three. -One, two, three. -One, two, three. -One, two, three. -[Zwickelmeier] OK, stop, stop, stop. The goal, my dear Princess, is to shine on this most important day of a young lady's life. To reach that goal, we must be consistent, focused, and never, ever lose sight of it. One should sleep, breathe, and-- ah, a mouse. [screams] [screams] [cat meows, howls] -Emmy! -Emmy! -What now? -[Karla] Emmy! [screams] It's a ghost, it's coming for me! It's coming for-- Emmy, kill it! -Here, mousey, here. -[screams] Mousey, come here. Emmy, help me, Emmy. -Emmy. -No, Rockfried! [screams, gasps] That's it, end of classes. Frau Zwickelmeier goes home. So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, and good-bye. [Karla] Frau Zwickelmeier, Frau Zwickelmeier? -Please don't leave. -Frau Zwickelmeier. Could you at least tells us what happened? I have no appetite for explanations. You shall go directly to your room and reflect on your egregious behavior. You know I can rescind your invitation to the ball at anytime I choose, yes? Do you doubt I would do it? -I didn't hear you. -No, Mr. Cerimonata. Bene. You heard him, Emmy. Off to your, uh, new room. Yes, Dad. [panting] Princess Emmy, what happened? They let me out of dance class early. [sighs] David? We were wrong about the test. I don't think it is the ball. I think it's Gizana. Well, think about it. Since she arrived, everything's gone wrong. So it's a test to see if you can put up with your horrible cousin without going bananas? Exactly. And I'm not at all sure that's a test I can pass. Of course I won't do anything silly. I will, I promise. You too, bye. Hmm. Little Miss Perfect. Two for you, two for Emmy. Share and share alike. I'll make sure she gets them. -[Vincenzo] Ah, Gizana. -[gasps] We have a very busy day tomorrow. I expect you both downstairs at 6:30 on the dot. Yes, Mr. Vincenzo. And be sure to tell your cousin. Senor Vincenzo does not tolerate tardiness. Oh, I'll make sure she knows. -[sighs] -[dramatic music] [sucks] Poor Emmy. This really is too wicked. [dramatic music] [horn blares] [gasps] [panting] Princess Emmy, I made it clear -we begin at 6:30 sharp. -[yawns] You must be washed, dressed and ready to go. -But nobody told-- -Before the final note -of the bugle is played. -[chuckles] So... are you gonna stand there all day? You have three minutes to get ready, beginning now. [laughs] -Tappy toe. -The time is ticking. [panting] -Ready. -Bene. Three, two, one, we start with balance. Balance is the basis of every activity. -Every move one makes must be precise. -[meows] Next the smiling practice. Smiling, young ladies, is nothing to smile about. It is very, very important to maintain your dignity -under all circumstances. -[cat meows] No education is complete until one has mastered the piano. [upbeat piano music] -[gasps] Really? -It was him. Next, elegance. The key here is to make your every move a work of art. [whistles] Art class starts at 2:30 sharp. Anybody want a muffin? Excellent idea, Your Majesty, let us have a short break. [gasps] [gags] [Emmy] Caesar, Rose, -Xaver, Valentine, Donny. -Shh! [Emmy] What's Daphne doing here? -[horses whinny] -[Gizana] You know my dream, Emmy? To be the most perfect princess in the entire world. And I think I can be. I think I have what it takes. What about you, Emmy? Do you have what it takes? Do you even know what it takes? -Hmm. -[horses neigh] [growls] Wonder where she keeps her broomstick. [Daphne] She isn't always like that. So you're on her side, are ya? Maybe you're a little miss perfect, too. We didn't think much of little miss perfects -in the army. -[Rose] Oi, knock it off. Rose is right, guys. This isn't Daphne's fault, she's just sticking up for her mistress. I'm not being funny or anything, but did that human just talk? Uh, yes. Yes, she did. -Some kind of trick, right? -No trick. And she understands what we say? That's pretty much how it works. Hello? -Hello. -Oh, my days. -You'll get used to it. -I'm not sure I... [neighs] -Shh. -[gasps] -[horses neigh] -Hmm? [gasps] Hmm. [Emmy] Whoa. -[horses neigh] -You're up to something. What is it, Emmy? Some fabulous little secret? -[whistles] -Or maybe you're cooking up one of your pathetic-- [screams] -[horse neighs] -[duck squeaks] -[gasps] -[growls] Donny. -[horse neighs] -[grunts] You thought that was funny, did you? You and your horses... it's a joke, Emmy. Not me. Whoa, that was close. [Emmy] Very close. A little over the top there, Donny. [sniffs] What's that smell? It's like flowers. Violets. [sniffs] Huh? It's coming from the passageway. -Hmm? -Huh. Anyone there? [water drips] [hooves clatter] You were right, it does smell of violets. -[grunts] -[hooves clatter] That was seriously weird. Xaver, lift your feet. -Hello. -[all gasp] Can anybody lend me a comb? How about you? My hair got a little discombobulated. Shall I biff him one? Whoa, and mess up my curls again? Seriously though, I really do need a comb. [horse growls] Is he going to wipe his feet on my wig again? Who are you? I'm Gregorius, the castle ghost, and that's Xaver, formerly of the Queen's own Royal Dragoons, the beautiful Rose, obviously. This must be Caesar, and you are... oh, I remember, the girl with the gift, the girl with the test. The girl who isn't looking after a certain secret book. I wonder if Gizana's found it yet. [gasps] It's still in my old room! -Stop, stop, stop. -Whoa! Horses that way, panicking princesses that way. [high tinkle] Hmm. Shortcut, leads straight to the castle. Hmm. -[panting] -Whoa! Is she always like that? Poor Vincenzo. -[horses neigh] -Mama mia. [panting] Whoa. [dramatic music] [panting] Huh? [grunts] Huh? Hmm. Hmm. Bathroom's free, Gizana. [Gizana] Thanks, Mrs. Bloom. You'll need to run the water for a minute. The boiler's on the blink again. [David] Thank you, sir, would you like an orange? No, thank you, I haven't the time right now. -They're lovely and ripe. -Yes, yes, maybe later. Hmm? -[Emmy] Psst, David. -What's going on? I need you to distract him. -How? -Use your imagination. Princess? Princess Emmy? [growls] [gasps] Whoa, whoa, whoa! [groans] Hmm. [sighs] Hmm. Phew. [gasps] A visitor. How nice. Just, uh... getting a book. One of your books, or one of mine? Mine, obviously. Well, you won't mind if I take a look. I do, actually. Hmm. -[panting] -[screams] Emmy, I should have known. -And what is this? -It's just an old book. Can I have it back, please? So, a storybook is more important than Frau Zwickelmeier's dance class? Consider it confiscated. -But I... -[car horn blares] [Vincenzo] She's here. Go straight downstairs and don't keep her waiting. [sighs] I've got my eye on you. [yells] At least things can't get any worse. [yells] Get out of my way! -Attenzione. -[screams] [cat meows] Rockfried, get out of the way! Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad! Oh, no! [yells] [Zwickelmeier groans] Well, does anyone have anything to say? [grunts] Nope. [engine starts] You win, I've had enough. -[Karla] Frau Zwickelmeier! -[car screeches] Please! Please Frau Zwickelmeier! Don't leave! There must be a perfectly... [sighs] innocent explanation. This isn't some church hall disco. I know, darling. What if they withdraw her invitation? [Emmy] Ouch. Oh, my goodness, are you all right? Nothing broken, nothing broken. It's just a little sprain. [Karl] Fionnuala's ointment? Yep, looks like it. Emmy's getting the ointment, Emmy's getting -the ointment. -[Emmy] No way. [laughs] Fionnuala's ointment. [speaks in foreign language] [clears throat] [Fionnuala] The ointment has a singular aroma. No, grazie. But it's not at all unpleasant. Oh, you all think you're so smart. Mark my words, when it's fixing they need, it's Fionnuala's ointment they ask for. Hmm? [Fionnuala] There we go. Nice and thick. You'll be thanking me in the morning. -[cat screeches] -You always do. [groans] -[grunts] -Not another one. [cat meows, purrs] Right, chaps, you know the drill. [laughs] -[horses neigh] -Fionnuala's wonder cream. [Karl] One, two, hup. There we go. -Oops, watch out for the door. -[growls] Now, let's go and see about that book. [Fionnuala] Perfect, you'll be good as new in no time. Now you rest here while I go check on that silly man. -Mr. Vincenzo? -Ouch. [sighs] [cat meows] -[door creaks] -[cat purrs] [grunts] [Emmy] Oh, oh... [door creaks] Huh? [nasal voice] No, no, Rockfried, you stay here. [cat meows] [door creaks] -[cat howls] -[door squeaks] [Karl] Blinds down, blankets up. Temperature? [gasps] High. Let's hope he's forgotten all about this in the morning. Otherwise he might just cancel Emmy's invitation. [Karla] Or even the entire ball. [gasps] Listen here, Emmy! If the ball gets canceled because of you, I'm going to-- Hmm? [grunts] [normal voice] So, my sneaky little cousin does have a secret. [sniffs] [Xaver] Excellent bandage work. You know, when I was in the Queen's Own Royal Dragoons, -we used to make-- -Not now, Xaver. It's not my foot I'm worried about. Vincenzo's got Carlotta's book. I said it was a bunch of old children's stories, but what if he loses it? What if he throws it out? You know what happens if I lose that book, Caesar. I'd lose the gift. Even Gizana's after it. Oh, no! [sighs] I need to get that book back. [sniffs] [horses neigh] -[ground creaks] -Shh, listen. What? What is it? [clattering] -Somebody's coming. -[horse neigh] For a secret tunnel, it doesn't seem all that secret. -[squeaks] -Who's there? Show yourself. [gasps] -Rockfried! -[cat meows] I distinctly remember telling someone to stay put. I'm sorry, I don't speak cat, but whatever excuse you're coming up with, I don't believe it. I best go back and check the door's closed properly. -[all] Bye, Emmy. -Be careful. -See you later, guys. -[female horse] Bye, Emmy. [groaning] Um... Huh. Curiouser and curiouser. [horses neigh] Guys, guys, don't stare, act normal. Hmm. [horses neigh] What's going on here? What did she mean she doesn't speak cat? [horse neighs] I know, you'd tell me if you could. You'd tell me what that infernal girl is up to. [yells] Hmm. [horse chews] What about you, Donny? Do you have anything you'd like to tell me? Anything you want to share? Hmm? -[lips smack] -[groans] Yuck! You disgusting bucket of, of slime! [owls hoot] [gasps] [narrator] The book must never be lost. For if it was, the gift itself would be lost. [Carlotta] Who are you? [gasps] Huh? [grunting] [gasps, growls] [Karla] It's going to be a stage. A stage for my little Princess. [Karl] That's the spirit. [Karla] You will finally make your grand entrance. Your official debut in society. [sighs] [groaning] She isn't really going to lose the gift, is she? I would hate it if we couldn't talk to her. We need to do something. There's only one thing for it. We need to get Carlotta's book back. [male horse] Us? We are her friends, aren't we? -What are you suggesting? -Stealth mission. We take the tunnel, sneak quietly into the castle, find Vincenzo's room, and steal the book back. -[horses neigh] -OK, there are 26 fully grown horses here. Excuse me. [scoffs] Twenty-seven fully grown horses. Sneaking quietly isn't what we do. Exactly, it's the last thing he'd expect. [all chattering] -Xaver's right. -Fine. Great. Stealth mission it is. Can I suggest that we line up single file. [horses neigh] Does anyone know how to open the door? -Shall we? -[Caesar] Do I have a choice? -No. -Kinda makes you proud, -doesn't it? -Absolutely. Right, coast is clear. Quietly now, secret scroll. Do humans actually eat this stuff? Our job is to love them, not to understand them. [horses whinny] -[glass smashes] -[cat meows] [male horse] I love what they've done with the place. [gasps] Did you see that corner thing? You lot, keep it down. -Oh, comfortable. -Very comfortable. Do you think my nose looks big? Hey, girls, seen Vincenzo? Nope, no Vincenzo here. Bingo, the plan worked. [snoring] [Emmy sighs] [groans] Whoa, whoa! -[Caesar] Morning, sleepyhead. -[Rose] Rise and shine! Caesar, Rose, all of you? Every single one. We thought we'd give you a surprise. Well, you certainly did that. And we brought you a little present. -[gasps] -[Xaver] Real page turner apparently. Carlotta's book! How on Earth did you get it? Got Xaver to thank. Army training came in useful after all. Oh, I don't know how to thank you. Chocolate, ice cream, lollipops? Donny. Hmm, the page. It's gone. -[gasps] -[screams] -[horses neigh] -That's mom. Emmy, in here. You guys wait here. And not a sound. I don't even want to hear you breathing. -[horses gasp] -[speaks in foreign language] [panting] [Karla] Who on Earth could have done it? I've no idea, it doesn't make any sense. [David gasps] Mom, you've got to see this. -[gasps] -I've never seen such a mess. -[Karla] Me neither. -[Emmy] You, uh, think it might have been Rockfried? That's too much calamity for such a little cat. Perhaps it was burglars, thieves in the night. What kind of burglar doesn't take anything? Who did it then? When you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how unlikely, must be the truth. [gasps] Your fantasma! Exactly. The ghost. [sighs] Don't be silly. I've heard him, Your Majesty, clanking his chains. Well, whoever it was, we have to clean it up. Ready, forward march. -[jaunty music] -[cat meows] Delays, delays, simply delays. Crazy, the entire family. Completamente pazzi. What if it was a ghost? Don't you start. [grunts] Hmm? [gasps] Hmm. -[stairs creak] -[Xaver] Shh. [Sebastian] Your Majesties, Your Majesties. -Sebastian. -The horses. What? What about them? [Sebastian] They've disappeared, Your Majesty. I've looked everywhere, somebody must have taken them. -Oh, no. -Emmy, if I get my hands -on that ghost. -Oh, Emmy, I'm so sorry. [horse neighs] [all gasp] -Marie, no. -I have to go. Shh. [Karla] Do you know something about this? Emmy, why? Uh, guess what, my foot's healed. [horse neighs] I have a duty, Your Majesties. I must ask myself, is this the behavior of a princess? She didn't mean any harm. Yet the horses clearly did not enter the castle of their own volition, they are merely animals after all. Oh, couldn't you give her just one more chance? We'd be really grateful. Three conditions. -[Karla] Name them. -[Vincenzo] Number one, Emmy cleans the mess. No help, no assistance, just her. -[Karla] Agreed. -[Karl] Absolutely. [Vincenzo] Number two, Emmy takes her studies seriously from now on, maximum effort, all of the time. Dress starts at half past six on the dot. [Karl] Could be tricky. [Vincenzo] This is my condition. -[Karla] OK, OK. -[Karl] And what's number three? -[Vincenzo] No more horses. -[gasps] [Vincenzo] We have seen enough of them. If these conditions are met, Princess Day classes will continue. If not, Emmy's invitation shall be revoked. [Karla] Emmy. Emmy! Emmy, you came very close to missing the Ball. Very, very close. But he said I can't see my horses. Well, yes. Yes, he did, and you should see it as a test, a test of character. Sebastian will take care of the horses while you concentrate on Mr. Vincenzo's classes. The sooner you prove you're a proper little Princess, the sooner you get your life back. Mm-hmm. -[jaunty music] -[cat meows] [cat meows] [grunting] [cat meows] Hmm. Ah, catching up on homework? -[gasps] David. - Carlotta and the Talking Gift. I didn't know you were interested in silly old legends. -I'm not. -Oh, I see. And I always had you figured as one of the smart ones. What's that supposed to mean? Don't worry, you're not the first one she's fooled with the old talking trick. [growls] [grunts] Hmph. [grunts] [high tinkle] [gasps] Hmm. -[cat meows] -Not now, Rockfried. -[blows] -[cat meows] -[gasps] -[cat meows] [gasps] [upbeat music] [cat meows] [sips] Wait, wait, I'm coming, I'm coming! Ah. Yes, I'm first. Morning, Emmy, what kept you? [gasps] [humming] [horses whinny] -Any sign? -Nothing. It's like she's forgotten all about us. [Caesar] She's busy. She'll come as soon as she can. I'm sure she will. [snoring] [alarm blares] [gasps] Ow! No time to lose. [upbeat music] [panting] Am I first? Did I beat her? -Morning, Emmy, what kept you? -[gasps] [Emmy groans] Mr. Cerimonata. Ah ha, understood? [Emmy] Mr. Cerimonata, did I-- [sighs] [growls] [whistling] [door opens] [ Emmy] Morning! Senorita Emmy. No Gizana? Strange. Very. [grunting] Sorry, Gizana, fair is fair. [clears throat] [trumpet blares] [gasps] [grunting] You witch! [grunting] -Should we get started? -Wait, wait, I'm here! Gizana, how nice of you to join us. Thank you, Emmy. It's very nice to be here. What kept you? Enough chit chat. I have decided that today will be a free day. No classes? No classes. Instead, I will take the time to reflect on your progress, and decide if you have reached the standard required to attend the Princess Day Ball, understood? -Mm-hmm. -Mm-hmm. Good, then I will see you tomorrow with my verdict. Any idea who put those-- [gasps] Oh, no, you don't! [panting] Come on, Emmy, the longer this takes, the worse it's gonna be. Emmy! [panting] -[gasps] -Morning, Gizana. What are you doing in here? I uh, felt like a muffin. You don't get muffins out of a box. Come on, I'll show you how to make them properly. Ah, this is the life. -[horses neigh] -I'd love to have seen her face when she discovered what you'd done. [panting] Excellent tactics, Emmy, and superb deployment of resources, if I may say so. I know that girl. You shouldn't wind her up, not if she's sniffing around about your gift. David convinced her it's all a big fairy story. Carlotta, the talking gift, everything. -[horses neigh] -[Emmy] At Carlotta's tower. What could she do? And don't forget, she doesn't have the map. -[horses neigh] -Thank you, Paul. Now why don't the rest of you take his advice and stop worrying so much. She can understand horses. Gizana won't find the book, because she isn't looking for the book, she doesn't even know I have it. It's nice and safe in the attic. -[horse neighs] -Exactly, I couldn't have put it better myself. So it is true. [all gasp] Gizana! -[horses neigh] -Gizana, please! You've got to get there before her! -Whoa! -Whoa! [panting] Shortcut! -[Gizana panting] -Good morning, Gizana. Morning, Auntie. Morning, Fionnuala. [panting] [Karla] There you are, sweetheart. We need to decide on the invitations. Velum or parchment? Which do you prefer? Velum? Parchment? [grunts] [sighs] [grunting] [panting] Hmm. [groans] [panting] [growls] Where is that book? [panting] Gizana? [grunts] [grunts] Oh, thank goodness. Hmm. Aha! [Gizana] Thanks ever so much. See you tonight. [owl hoots] -[bird cries] -[gasps] -[wood creaking] -Huh? [gasps] The book! [panting] No, no, no, no! [grunting] Gizana, you witch! -[horses neigh] -[grunting] [grunting] Ready, Daphne? You'll be talking to me soon. [grunts] [horse neighs] [gasps] Gizana, come back! No! [horse neighs] [bird cries] [bird cries] -[birds squawk] -That must be it. Let's go. [horse nickers] [horse neighs] Why shouldn't I have the talking gift, too? I'm Princess Gizana! Come on. Work! [grunts] [dramatic music] -[Emmy] Gizana! -[gasps] Gizana, please! The book! [grunts] I can't lose it! Why not? It doesn't even work. You're good at tricking people, aren't you? I wasn't trying to trick anyone. You made me think I could have the talking gift. You made me believe. No, let go! [grunting] [thunder cracks] Gizana, wait! Gizana! I wanted to be special! I wanted to talk to horses, but it's all a lie! Gizana! If I can't have it, nobody will! [grunts] No! [gasps] The book! [high tinkle] -[thunder cracks] -No, please. Huh? [whimpers] No, no, no. No, no. Please, please, please. No, no, no, no. [somber music] -[thunder cracks] -[gasps] [screams] [Carlotta] Who are you? [Gizana] Oh, Emmy! -Gizana! -Emmy, please! -[yells] -I've got you! [grunts] [gasps] Help! [horse neighs] Caesar! Please, help me! [horse neighs] [screams] [grunting] [panting] [horse whinnies] [sniffles] [horse nickers] I don't understand them anymore. [horse neighs] [sobbing] I've lost the gift, Caesar, it's gone. [Emmy sobbing] [sobbing] [horse neighs] [birds twitter] [jaunty music] [Vincenzo] Ah, finally. I see, I see, I see. Old habits die hard. With Emmy's imprudent behavior in front of the Elders, she shows she is not yet ready to enter polite society. Her invitation to the Ball shall be revoked. -[gasps] -And what shall I do with you? Shall I revoke yours, too? [gasps] You're not being fair! What? You don't know anything. She saved my life out there! What on Earth have they been up to? [horses neigh] [door opens] [horse neighs] [door closes] [horses neigh] [horses snort] Emmy, I... I'm sorry. If you want me to go, I can go. No, please stay. [horse neighs] [horse hooves clatter] [high tinkle] [all gasp] [horses neigh] [horse sneezes] -Huh? -Oh. -[gasps] -Hmm? -[inspirational music] -[gasps] [Emmy] Carlotta? Princess Emmy. You have shown yourself worthy of the gift. Huh? [gasps] [grunts] [gasps] Wow. Caesar, what does that mean? I have no idea and we can't exactly ask her, can we? -[male horse gasps] Whoa. -[Rose] Have you ever seen -anything like it? -[male horse] What's happening? -Flowers. -Where did they come from? -It's like violets. -Huh? [laughs] -Guys! -Oh, my days! -I understand you! -[horses cheer] I understand every word you're saying! -[laughs] -I've got the gift back! [horses cheer] [laughs] Hey, Emmy, what did she say? That you're one of us now. Really? I really am? [Gregorius] Wait, wait, wait. I would like to congratulate this girl as well. For bravery, she receives a medal. -[high tinkle] -Oh. Oh. Well, worth a try, I suppose. Perhaps you'll save me a dance at the Princess Day Ball, my lady. Wait, you mean, they're going to let us go? [all cheer] Of course! Did you ever doubt it? Yeah! We're going! We're going to the Princess Day Ball! [upbeat music] [narrator] And so by saving Gizana, Emmy passed her test. -[lips smack] -The Princess Day Ball was a spectacular success, and Emmy danced all the way through to the wee small hours. As for the talking gift, it remained a closely guarded secret known only to Emmy's oldest friend David, and her newest one, Gizana. [high tinkle] [cat meows] -Ah. -[groans] -[screams] -[Emmy] Rockfried! -You silly cat. -[groans] -[Karl] Oh, Emmy. -[Karla] Oh, Emmy. [Vincenzo] Honestly, all of them, completamente pazzi. -[Karla] Sweetheart. -[Karl] Yes, dear? How did you make Señor Vincenzo change his mind? Well, I gave him one of my muffins. -[laughs] -Muffin, anyone? -[laughs] -[firework whines] ¶ Deep down your heart ¶ ¶ Is fueling a fire ¶ ¶ Cinders and smoke ¶ ¶ When your anger escapes ¶ ¶ Make sure this fire gets stronger ¶ ¶ Show the world who you are ¶ ¶ Who you wanna be ¶ ¶ What you need from me ¶ ¶ Turn to the sun ¶ ¶ Follow your instincts with pride ¶ ¶ Take a look and see ¶ ¶ You can always be ¶ ¶ Strong like I feel ¶ ¶ Calling on your own accord ¶ ¶ So take a hard look at your reflection ¶ ¶ It shines so bright ¶ ¶ You do not always have to wear a mask ¶ ¶ To hide your light ¶ ¶ When things get too much ¶ ¶ Then just take your time ¶ ¶ No matter how bad things get ¶ ¶ There's always a way out ¶ ¶ Just take a deep breath ¶ ¶ And head into the flames ¶ ¶ When things get too much ¶ ¶ Then just take your time ¶ ¶ Who you wanna be ¶ ¶ What you need from me ¶ ¶ Turn to the sun ¶ ¶ Follow your instincts with pride ¶ ¶ Take a look and see ¶ ¶ You can always be ¶ ¶ Shine like the sun ¶ ¶ Find out that you feel alive ¶ ¶ Who you wanna be ¶ ¶ What you need from me ¶ ¶ Turn to the sun ¶ ¶ Take a look and see ¶ ¶ You can always be ¶ ¶ Shine like the sun ¶ ¶ Who you wanna be, who you wanna be ¶ ¶ Ooh ¶ ¶ Who you wanna be, who you wanna be ¶ ¶ Take a look and see ¶ ¶ You can always be ¶ ¶ Shine like the sun ¶ ¶ Take a look and see ¶ ¶ You can always be ¶ -¶ Shine like the sun ¶ -¶ Shine like the sun ¶
