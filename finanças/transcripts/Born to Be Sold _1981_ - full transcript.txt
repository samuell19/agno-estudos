- [Hawker] Nice watch, Mama, check it out. Hey. Mama I got you a watch. Brand new, brand new. (gentle music) - Miss Carlin, I've been evicted. They're condemning my place. - When? - Two weeks, they're putting me and my babies out on the street to make condominiums. You better talk to the Housing Authority. - 300,000 bucks for that lousy neighborhood. - You should talk to Housing Authority. - I did. - And? - They gave me a bunch of forms. - Yes? - I can't read them. They don't make sense. It's all law talk. (gentle music) - This could be delayed. Now, if it takes too long, we'll find you emergency housing. - Well okay, but you know I have to- - We'll find you emergency housing. - Okay, Miss Carlin. - Good morning. - It's almost noon. (telephone ringing) - Cate Carlin. (mysterious music) - [Contestant On TV] I'll take the six. - [Host] She'll take the six, she says. - [Contestant] Come on, something double. Doubles, come on. - [Host] Trying to steal a double. She's rolled a five instead. Okay, that's it. - [Contestant On TV] Come on. Six number, six number. (Cindy groaning) - Don't worry, Cindy, it only feels like you're gonna die. (girls laughing) - [Contestant On TV] Big numbers, come on. - [Host] Biggies. Biggies. Five, with a two and three automatic. I don't like that. I don't like that at all. - Pretty good (television playing) (telephone ringing) - Hi? Who's this? - Jerry Boyd. So, a man got drunk and put his mother in the hospital. - The duty work should be right back. - He's interviewing. The child placement is someone on the way. - All right, go on. How did I get so lucky? I heard you'll take on anything in the name of Family Services. - That's a vicious lie. (telephone ringing) - Hello? Hello. - Hi there? You know how to type? You do, huh? - Cute. - He is Jerry Boyd and he's a brave boy, aren't you? - I met him. - Oh! What happened to the stock broker you supposed to be in love with this week? - Commodities. That doesn't mean I can't look. - Let's get a clean piece of paper and see just how well you can type. (gentle music) (Cindy groaning) (telephone dialing) - Marty? I need the phone. - I'm trying to call my mom. - Listen, go out back and see if Matty is still working. Susan? Susan? Are you gonna time Melanie's contractions? - I gotta talk to my mom, I really want- - Listen, your mom wouldn't just send you here if she didn't have a hospital, okay? Now, go get Matty. Admissions please. (Cindy groaning) - Joan wants you. - Joan needs you. - I called an ambulance for Ellen, this is what you got? - What's so wrong Marty? - Shut up! - Why do you have to sell to her? - Oh mom, you're so stupid, I don't pay for it. We got a little secret, your old man and me. - Shut up! (Ellen mumbling) - Go take care of Ellen, go on. - What's so funny? - Now what are we gonna do, huh? What are we gonna do? You know we don't get paid for junky babies, Marty. Shut up! Marty? (gentle music) - Make it stop, I hate it. (lady groaning) (gentle music) (lady groaning) (intense music) (lady groaning) - It's pretty good stuff. Here you go. Bye bye Jerry. Thank you. (telephone ringing) (telephone ringing) - Yes, Kate Carlin please. (telephone ringing) - Kate Carlin, hello? Hello? Hello? - [Cindy] Cate Carlin? - Yes speaking. Who's this? - [Cindy] Cindy. Cindy Carlton. - Cindy? How are you? - I'm in trouble. - [Kate] Shoplifting? - No! Real trouble. I ran away from this place. I can't go back. I just- - Okay. Now wait a minute, slow down. What place? - I can't, it hurts. Please, please help me. - Who hurt you Cindy? Where are you? Where are you? - Western or something, I don't know. I can't stay here. - [Kate] Where's your mother? - I don't know, her phone's busy. - Listen, can you get home? Can you make it home Cindy? - I can try. Yeah, I can try. - Okay, good. Good girl. Now, I'll meet you there, okay? - Okay, okay, I'll try. - [Kate] Bye bye. (intense music) - Where's mom? - Mom, she's here. Gross. - I hate that place? They don't care about anything. - But what you expect? - Go do your homework and mix them up. It'll be okay. They'll take care of you. (Cindy groaning) - Mom, they can't have my baby. - Cindy, you already promised. - Well, I changed my mind. - We've already spent some of the money. How am I supposed to pay it back? Be a good girl, okay? And when this is over, we can go away someplace special. You pick. - I want to keep the baby. - No! You're just a baby yourself. I have to take care of it. I won't go through that again. - [Cindy] I'll quit school. - No. - I'll get a job. - No! - Mom, don't make me go back to that place. I want to be with you. Don't be stupid! It's bad enough you got pregnant barely 14 years old. You're lucky somebody is willing to pay you for your mistake. (baby speaking gibberish) It's stupid to quit school and raise a kid. - Why? You did it. - You won't end up like me. - Mom, I'm so scared. - Cindy, we were worried about you. - Mom? (Cindy groaning) - How far apart are they? - She just had one. - She could have screwed everything up. - She's scared. Can't you see that? - Westfield won't pay if there's any trouble. Even Cindy doesn't even know yet, we'll see. I'm at Cindy's so call Southside Ambulance, will you? She's going into heavy labor. (Cindy groaning) - Don't hurt her! - So what? - Don't, please don't. No, please top. Mama, please mama. Mama! - What's going on here? Cindy? (Cindy crying) - Who the hell is she? - Our social worker. - Oh great! - The baby is coming. It's coming out. - Where's the phone? - I already called an ambulance. (children crying) Everything has been taken care of, right Cindy? - Get away from me, the both of you! - I'll try to make her comfortable. Lay on the bed. It's gonna be alright. - Cindy must have called her. - Can't you shut those kids up? - Wait Marty! Where are you going? - All, okay. It's okay, hang on. - I don't think I can wait. - It's okay Cindy, it will be okay. Now, let me just see what I can do to help you. - It hurts. - Just try to relax, all right? (Cindy screaming) - I can't! I can't! Please help me. - Okay. Janet! Janet! - It hurts. (Cindy groaning) - Janet! Janet! Janet, where are you? (Cindy groaning) (intense music) I'm right here. I'm right here. - Tell me what to do. - Breath. Relax. Now Cindy, You and I, we can do this together, okay? (Cindy groaning) (intense music) - One, (exhales) two, (exhales) three, bend down. - I can't. - Yes you can! Now come on. - I can't! - Yes you can! You can do it, breath. There, that's it. Good girl, good girl. You're doing just fine Cindy. It's coming. I can see the head. Good girl, good girl, you're doing just fine. It's coming. (baby crying) (Cindy groaning) Yes! (Cindy groaning) Good, good. Okay, okay. (Cindy groaning) (baby crying) - Is it okay? (baby crying) What is it? - It's a girl. - What's wrong with her? - She's beautiful. - Can I see? (Cindy sighing) - You did great kid. - Are you sure it's okay? it looks kind of weird. - I know. Isn't it wonderful? (both chuckle) - Well look here. A little patient, were we? Let's see how this little one's doing, huh? (soft music) - Mama, did you see? It's little girl. - [Janet] She's real nice honey. - We'll just tie off the cord, and then we're gonna get you and your little girl right from the hospital. (siren whirling) (horn honking) - How did you know what to do? - I didn't. I didn't know. I mean, Cindy needed help and we did it together. - I would have just fainted. I mean, I had to leave the room when my dog had puppies. Let's call it miss babies. - Excuse me. - Hey, how's it? Oh, baby, anyway. - Oh, he's fine. I think I'm gonna pay him another visit tonight. - After hours? - Isn't that just a little above and beyond the call of duty? - I suppose, but exactly an ordinary experience. What's good though? - Meat. - That's cheap? - Talk. - I'll have a chili burger and cheese. - Outstanding. - You know, I remember thinking that getting Cindy through it was all it mattered, just get it over with, and then I look down at this funny little squirming person in my hands, then I realized that nothing was over at all, it was just beginning. - Kate? Is that a maternal longing of yours? - No, not really. I just hadn't thought about babies since Michael and I split up. He always wanted a family. - You didn't? - Not then, not with him. Oh, he left me well off and he wasn't a monster or anything like that. - Oh, they never are. What's the divorce is fine. - Cute. You know, Claire? Cindy is only 14 years old. She's already a mother. - The baby got a big send off. Cindy Carlin's baby will be released as soon as the Strickland's get here. - What about the Louise couple? - Ah ah, take too long for them to get here. All this time that Cindy has to think about it, the better. St. Louis gonna have the next baby. That's Susan McCabe, isn't it? - Right. That's a good idea. - Marty, Marty don't you think you're a tester with Phil? I can handle it. - [Woman On Telephone] Dr. Cradle, 911 lease. Dr. Cradle, 91 please. - If there's something wrong with the girl, I'll find out about it sooner or later. - She's she's doing drugs, heroin. - Terrific! - What about Susan? - She is of no use to me now. - But if we cut her off, as soon as she hits the streets, everything's going to come down on us. - Marty, is there little problems you can't handle here? - Huh, I can handle it. - When you do that, the next time you relocate the home, she doesn't go. - [Woman On Telephone] Dr. Goodwill, please report to the emergency room. - They are here Mr. Westfield. - Oh! The Stricklands are here. Marty, would you do me a favor? Stop getting involved with the merchandise, it's costing me too much money. There she is. Go ahead Mrs. Strickland, she won't break. Well, what do you think? - She's lovely, isn't she Love? - Yes, but she really is tiny. - Then you should carry her downstairs, will you? - The phone call came was quite a surprise. - Well, I knew how anxious you are. Besides this baby, it's just perfect for you. - Could we meet the mother? - That's not a good idea Mrs. Strickland. If she knew who you were, she could just show up on your doorstep five or 10 years from now, could create problems. Now, Cindy is a lovely girl, A student you know? Get on this list the whole thing. Boyfriend's an athlete, one of those big strapping guys. They were talking about marriage but their parents finally convinced them that at their age, it was a pretty foolish thing. - I wanted to keep my baby. - She'll have a good home. - She got a good home with me. - Maybe you can talk some sense to her, she agreed to a month ago. - Cindy, I'm sure that your baby has found a lovely home. Adoptive parents were checked out very carefully by the county. Who was your counselor? - There wasn't one, it was done privately. What do you mean? - They bought my baby! - You make me sick! They pay for the doctor bills, hospital room, food clothes. We didn't have to go to the county and beg for money. She agreed to everything. - Cindy? - I was mixed up then. I didn't know how much I would want to keep her. - Fine! But you can't keep her in my house! Listen, why don't you get some rest, okay? Let me check it out. - Can you help me? - Cindy, I thought I find you in your room. I'm Westfield. - Kate Carlin, Family Services. I was in the hospital on some other business but I could leave without finding out how my girl's doing. Are you a doctor? - No, I'm an attorney. - He's the one that sold the my baby. - Cindy? Cindy? I know you will find this hard to understand, but right now sweetheart, your emotions are a little out of control. Now that's a physical fact of childbirth. Just give yourself a few days and you'll see how silly this is. We'll talk then, okay? - Maybe there's some place that we can talk? - Oh, sure. Call me on my office. - Mr. Westfield, why don't we just get it over with right now? - All quite legally, and that should have no effect on the carpet as welfare eligibility, if that's your concern. - It's not. My concern as the mental and emotional well being of my clients, Mr. Westfield. - Then you can't possibly believe that that infant could be better off with Cindy than with the love and the security of a two-parent home. - Well, I'm open minded. In fact, I'd like to meet them, just set Cindy's mind at ease free. - I'm afraid that's not possible. They're insisting on strict anonymity, for their sake as well as the baby. - How are they selected? - Well, I've interviewed them a number of times. Cindy was given all the background except the names of course. She never hesitated. And the Department of Adoptions goes through everything after the petition is filed. If you'll excuse me, I do have an appointment. - Sure. Thank you very much for your time. Sure that we'll be seeing each other again. - I must say, I'm disturbed Miss Carlin. Someone from your department is willing to have her tax paid, support her 14 year old girl and her illegitimate baby, unless you have a choice for them other than wellbeing. - Part of my job is to Westfield is to protect the rights of that girl and her baby against exploitation. And since she's asking for my help, it's my responsibility to investigate this and then advisor her. - Well, you're a very bright lady Miss Carlin, I'm sure you will do what's best for everyone. (intense music) - Morning. Good morning Claire? - Good morning. Hey, want some? Like a perfect paperweight, I think I'll pass. - You got a second. - Sure. - Didn't you used to go with the guy in adoptions? - Did I ever? Why? - Well, I need to find out about adopting privately where the laws are. Do you still speak to him? - Not since his wife found out. Hey, wait a minute, he had this friend- - Yeah. - perfect guy. (door knocking) - Excuse me, Sergeant Pro. - I'm at lunch. - So am I. Kate Carlin, Department of Family Services. - Kate Carlin. - The same Kate Carlin, whose phone calls you haven't returned all morning. - That's Kate Carlin? - I won't take much of your time. - Sure, why don't you have a seat? - I'm interested in finding out about private adoptions. - Are you married? - No. - Then where do you get a husband? Single parents got it rough. - One of my clients has agreed to a private adoption. And she's having some second thoughts. - Independent. - Pardon? - State of California refers them as independent adoptions. - Oh, excuse me. Independent adoptions. Anyway, I would like to give her my best advice. I just need to know what the facts are first. - Miss Carlin, I think you better speak with my partner. She loves to talk. - That's fine with me. When will she be back? - Next week. She's in Mexico, honeymoon. All right. All right. What facts? - What are her rights? The natural mother, I mean. - Depends on the agreement from the broker. - Ever heard of Robert Westfield? - Come on. Let's have some lunch. Now, you've met Westfield, so you know what? He's definitely one of the slickest. - That doesn't surprise me. - You're mind? - Oh, help yourself. Can't anything be done about him about this whole business to private, excuse me. Independent adoptions? - There are legit attorneys, who handle adoptions. Trouble is that the demand so high. It's tough for some of them to not to take advantage. - Couldn't Cindy's case be aboveboard? - Not Likely. Not with Westfields. He getting too rich off the business, he be going by the book. - What kind of money we talking about? - Hundreds of thousands. - You kidding? And he keeps coming up with the goods? - He pays girls to get pregnant, brings them in from out of state, Europe. And he caters the couples with money. He gotta have lots of money because they almost always want a nice white baby, and hat's hard to find in a public adoption. - How does he get away with it? - You know, one of the first things that really good attorney learns about the law, is how to get around it. He's vulnerable in the slavery act. It's a tough conviction. We practically have to catch him handing over the baby with one hand and taking the money when the other. Westfield is too smart to ever let that happen. We put the heat on him, but never been able to pin it on him. I've got to attend to something. - There's nothing you can do? - You got any ideas? I ran out a long time ago. Miss Carlin, a couple spends 30 to $40,000 on a baby, It's got to mean something. - Sure, it means they've got money, which has nothing to do with parenting. I mean, I have seen physically and emotionally better kids all over the city, including the affluent areas. At least Cindy should have a choice. - Forget it! Westfield's way out of your league. - If she had been raped, would just say, "Forget it?" The raper shouldn't be brought to justice? - Haven't you noticed that justice has very little to do with a law? - The law is an agreement. It's for human beings. It's human beings agreeing to protect other human beings. We're talking about a week old baby and a 14 year old girl. - My wife, we light a candle every day. (intense music) - [Carlin's Mother] It's your mother Carlin, Don't forget the birthday on Sunday. Everyone's coming in the afternoon to watch the game on TV. We're barbecue steaks after. Call me later or tomorrow. Bye bye. - [Keith] Kate Carlin, this is Keith German. I work with your uncle Eddie and I met your folks in his place last night, thing is, they asked me to throw party for him on Sunday. And your mother's going to give you a call that maybe we could go together. So call me tomorrow in my office, same number, that is, extension 36. Bye. - [Man On Telephone] By looking behind your case Carlin, you won't see me, but I'm going to be there. (intense music) Keep looking behind the case Carlin, you won't see me, but I'm gonna be there. (intense music) (telephone ringing) - I didn't know who else to call Miss Carlin. They weren't even going to tell me except Ellen, one of the other girls found out and then she told me. Then I tried calling Mr. Westfield and he wouldn't talk to me and we're not going to be here next week. - Slow down Cindy. Now you're absolutely certain that Westfield switched couples on you? - Yes. They were supposed to live in St. Louis. - Well, I honestly don't know what I can do. - Maybe I should have the baby myself. I don't know, but I gotta find out if she's okay. And I think that you were the only one that could find out for me. And you there when when she was born, you truly want find out if she was okay too? - Of course I do. I want both of you to be okay. - Oh no, listen, here comes my mom. She's gonna kill me if she finds out. I'm going to go crazy if I don't find out about my baby, okay? Bye. - Cindy? - Then what am I gonna do? - This takes time. - I realized that it's not part of the normal process Mr. Strickland, but the natural mother is my client, and I thought that for her peace of mind, you would find a shortlist? - Miss Carlin, I don't mean to be difficult but my attorney has told me that the only interview we have to be subjected to is from the Bureau of Adoptions. It will only take a few minutes, Mr. Strickland, please. Mr. Strickland? Thanks for the info Claire, but it didn't work. - Didn't know. How did you get their name? I don't know what you're talking about Kate, to Strickland's. The people who adopted Cindy's baby? You didn't leave this on my windshield? - No. - Then who did? - I don't know. I think I have a secret admirer. - Whoever broke in knew exactly what he wanted. Went straight for the adoption file. Never so much as touched the typewriter. - What about the petty cash box? - A couple of a hundred bucks. Lousy smoke screen. Is Cindy Carlton back in town? - I don't know. She hasn't been to see her social worker. - Yeah. Kate Carlin. How close you sticking to her? - I know the last time she went to the John. - Good. Keep it up. - It's very kind of you to let me in, Mr. Strickland. I drove by so many times that I finally just had to knock. I haven't seen it since we moved back East. You've done some lovely things. - Well, actually, it was mostly the decorator. I had a big house to do a lot. - Frankly, we couldn't afford it. - Well, we were very lucky. Carl, I mean, my husband, his business really picked up a lot last year. - How nice? What kind of business is he in? - He's an accountant. He's working late. - I wonder, could I see the upstairs if it's not too much trouble? - Yes, of course. (baby crying) - Aaaw, she's so sweet. You must be very happy. (baby crying) - She always seems to do this, I'm sorry. Teressa? Teressa? (baby crying) I'm sorry. I guess being an only child didn't help. I never was exposed very much to babies. Of course, Carl says it just takes a little getting used to, but that crying, well, it's the loud noises, they've always kind of bothered me. Not him though. He he has two other children. They live back east with their mother. - Oh, how old are they? - They're teenagers. Carl calls us his second chance family. It's funny, but Annie never cries when he holds her. - I really should be going. I'm terribly sorry if I've intruded on you. - Oh, no, no, that's all right, I've enjoyed it. (intense music) - Come in Kate. - Why do I feel like I'm being summoned to the principal's office? - Give me a break. - Sorry. - What's your caseload? - 38 million. 60. You already know that. - Is it too much for you? - No more than it's ever been. - Markowitz, no heat for four days, couldn't reach that guy move, arrested without proper papers. They booked him as an illegal. Snyder found an interpreter for him and found his immigration papers in the file that dated three weeks ago. The cabinet- - I get the picture Malcolm. Does it say anything in there about the Dickens or the Marquees children or Idah Pearson's new apartment with hot and cold running water? - Why the Carl's baby? - Oh, I see. - Do you? I tried to let it rest for a week or so, but it's getting more time consuming. - This one's special. - Would you explain that the guy, Markowitz? - Malcolm? Cindy Carlton's baby isn't the only one. There's a whole network out there. Baby importers, interstate adoptions for people who don't qualify. Women actually getting paid to get pregnant. It's a big business. Cash under the table for the purchase and sale of human lives. - I didn't know it had become such a cause for you. - Neither did I. - Good for you. We all have our interest. Claire works the rape hotline, Wilson's into drug we have and my baby street gangs, but we do it on our own time, precious as it is. - Got it. - One more thing, you should know about the complaints from your coworkers. - What? - You know how they get when the pressure is high? - Oh yeah, that's why they call it the pit. - Nevertheless, you have always set the highest professional standards for yourself. Some of the others resent it. - Prejudice. - Office politics. - Prejudice. - Human nature. Give us both break, Kate. If you don't do it yourself, I'll have to step in and prioritize your cases. I'd rather not do that. I have too much respect for your work. - Thanks Malcom. - Have a nice day. (intense music) - Oh, don't do that. - Sorry. - When did you get back? - Over the weekend. My mom didn't feel so good, so I take care of the kids. Oh, I brought you something from Hawaii. It's kind of wilted but still smells pretty good. - It's beautiful, thank you. - Did you find them? - Well, I only met the woman but she seemed nice, just fine. Oh, so sweet. Thank you. I'm running late, can I give you a ride? - Oh no. Joey brought me. He kind of feels bad about the baby and everything. He's 17. Miss Carlin, I gotta talk to you. - I can't, not right now. - Come on Miss Carlin, it's important. I want to see my baby again. - Cindy, that's just not possible. I've already gotten into trouble for taking so much time with you. - What about later, please? - I'll try. I'll try to call you at home tonight. - Forget it. - Cindy? - Forget it! (gentle music) (upbeat music) - Yes, indeed. - The classic thing these days. - Hey, hey, hey, were talking to you mama. How about some action? You shouldn't be walking around here by yourself, you could get hurt. (upbeat music) - How'd you find me? - Your brother told me. - Great. - Do you wanna talk? - Just really sexy. He was really relieved that I didn't keep baby. Gave him 500 bucks to sign the release. Look, can we pass it? - Oh nice, beautiful. - I love it. It doesn't mean that we're going standing or anything like that. My mom would kill me if she thought I was seeing him. He's 17, you know? - I know. - Are they rich? - They seem to be pretty comfortable. They have a beautiful big house, lots of nice furniture. - Where is it? All right. All right. Did you see it? - Cindy, don't worry about the baby. - All I ever do is think about her, about how she must look, how big she must be getting, do they love her as much as I do? I've named her Kristen. I've never wanted something so bad in my life. - Cindy, I can understand that. There are lots of reasons to keep her, but you should just stop and think about the reasons you shouldn't. - You know, all people do is treat me as if I'm stupid or something else. I mean, you know I may be 14, old enough to have a baby. Now maybe I'm just old enough to take care of one. - Here, give it to me. - Do you have a match? And don't tell me I'm too young to smoke. - The lighter is inside the glove compartment, give me the french fries. (intense music) Ready? (intense music) Miss Carlton, this is Kate Carlin. May I please speak to Cindy? I dropped her off 20 minutes ago at the house. Have you been there the whole time? I'll explain later, sorry. Bye. (baby crying) - Get away from her! (both screaming) (door knocking) (intense music) - Hello. Mrs. Strickland? (intense music) Cindy? - Shhh. - Cindy, what happened? - She was trying to kill my baby. Don't you see Kate? I just can't leave her here. - Give her to me. - April? April? - She's trying to take our baby? - What? Who the hell are you? - I'm Kate Carlin, we spoke on the phone, Family Services, remember? - They try to kill our baby - Hold on. - I think we should talk. - Get out of here! - Listen, your wife is very upset. - Of course she's upset, now you get out of here now or I will call the police. - I can explain Mr. Strickland. - You have no right being here. - I'm the mother. - How dare you say? You didn't even want it. You couldn't wait to get rid of it. Well, you gave up all rights that baby when you sign the papers. If you're not out here by the time they answer I'll have you both placed under arrest. - Mr. Strickland, please hear me. - Breaking and entering, also attempted kidnapping. - All right. All right. We're leaving. Cindy Come on. - We can't leave! - We're leaving. I'm very sorry, but this is not the end of it. (baby crying) (intense music) - I just don't get it. - Please, Cindy, I want to go home. - I just don't get it. I tell you that she almost killed Kristen. Why won't you to believe me? - Why should I? Dammit! You stole the address for my briefcase along with who knows what else? That doesn't exactly make you the most reliable witness does it? By the way, may I? - Okay, next time might be too late. You swore to me she was all right. You wouldn't even have the address if it wasn't for... - What do you know about that? Cindy? Cindy? Cindy, what do you know about that? You won't tell her anything, will you? - Well, all because I was so upset in Hawaii. Joey kind of broke into Mr. Westfield's office, left it on your car. - But why do you have to steal it from me? - Oh, Joey won't give me the address, he thinks as soon as I get Kristen and I'll be at a door asking him to get married or something. - Would you? - No, I don't think so. - If I help you, Cindy, if I help you, will you think about letting another couple adopt Kristen through the county? - I don't know. - Cindy, will you think about it? - I don't know. - Well, at least you're honest about that? (intense music) (intense music) - How the hell did she find us? - I had somebody watching her Mr. Strickland, but he got involved in something else. - That's terrific. That's just terrific. You don't realize what this has done? You promised us anonymity. We paid you well a lot of money to make sure that something like this didn't happen. You got to make sure that the social worker doesn't get my baby back. - Are you threatening me Mr. Strickland? - Call it whatever you want. I just want to make sure you earn some of that outrageous fee. - That outrageous fee Mr. Strickland, bought your wife signed statements that she was incapable of bearing children for medical reasons. It also paid to destroy adoption rejections from three or was it four different agencies because of a history of mental instability. All of which didn't seem too outrageous doing at the time. Now, if he falls apart now Mr. Strickland, that's your problem. My job is over. - Oh, is it? Well, I am not going to lose the baby. You either make sure that Miss Carlin gets off my back or I'm gonna sue you for every cent you're worth. If that doesn't work, I'm going to blow your operation wide open. - Mr. Strickland, don't be foolish. - I'm not being foolish. Don't you see? I have nothing to lose. (glass breaking) - All right. - I haven't talked to her. She would have changed your mind if you'd let her be. - When? It's been over a month and Cindy gets more determined every day. - You don't understand. - Try convince me that Cindy is completely wrong. - I don't want to fight Cindy, she's not like those turns around, just needs a lot of love. She's real, kind, artistic. showing pictures and making presents as crazy. I wanted to do something with their hands. No hairdresser, maybe? - Yeah. - You make pretty good money. You think she could take care of herself? Instead of finding some jerk pay the rent when he's sober, She's really not beat her up. She's smart. - Do you love her? - Of course I love her, I'm her mother. - Janet, Cindy's a mother too. - It was a pleasure meeting you Mr. And Mrs. Hoffman. - Thank you, Mr. Westfield, and I do hope that we can work this out. - Miss Carlin, glad you made it. - I can't stay long. - Good. I'm doing court. Melanie Brown calls again. Tell him not to waste my time anymore. This way Miss Carlin. Would you care for anything? - No. Thank you. - Excuse me. Sweetheart, you've got my persona? - Yes, sir. - Watch the Old West. Please sit down. - Thank you. - Somebody like you doesn't have to watch what you eat. Get away with anything right? - Mr. Westfield? - Melanie, remind me to call Jack coulomb at Caldwell deposition before I leave. I'm sorry. Where were we? - We weren't. - Oh, thank you. Well, but the whole oh my god except for my wife. You sure you won't have anything? - I'm sure. - So how are you? - Overworked Mr. Westfield. So if you don't mind. - Miss Carlin, I have a client who's considering pressing criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering, and attempted kidnapping. - You could probably tell me all about breaking and entering. - My client has also mentioned suing you for personal damages, starting with the invasion of privacy, harassment and the destruction of personal property. They also want me to contact your supervisors informing them of your actions, which are unprofessional, irresponsible and completely out of line. All of which will probably cost you your job. You had no right taking Cindy Carlton to the Strickland's home. - I was trying to stop her. - Oh, sure. - I don't believe this. I'm sitting here defending myself against you. Did you know that Mrs. Strickland nearly killed the baby that night? - Can you prove that? I mean, you actually saw it? - Cindy did. - Cindy did? Oh really? I'm afraid that 14 year old kid with her background, desperate to get back a child that she shouldn't have had in the first place would hardly be considered a credible witness. - Brilliant. Really brilliant. What's the deal? You didn't ask me here just to warn me about all this. You want to negotiate, right? My job, my reputation, for what? - Miss Carlin? There's only one way to stop the Strickland's from pressing charges against you. - What's that? - If Cindy Carlton doesn't petition, the court for her baby, knock her out of it before next week's hearing. - Is that all? Well I'm afraid that Cindy's already made her decision nothing will change her mind. - You could. - I don't want to. - Miss Carlin I really think you want to reconsider you're facing very serious challenges. - I'll see you at the hearing. - Hello, get me Marley. (gentle music) (intense music) (intense music) - Gentlemen, thank you very much. Why are you working so late? - Probably for the same reason as you. - I suppose you got a license number? - No. - Car color? - No, it was dark, all I could see were headlights. - Narrows it down. - I know that Westfield is involved somehow I bet my life on it. - You already have but why don't you ask your boyfriend to stay with you tonight? Kidding. - I didn't say I didn't have one. Don't start analyzing Sir, I'm not in the mood. - I just figured a good looking girl like you ought to be married or something. - I tried marriage, didn't suit me. - It's a nice picture. You're hungry? - No, go help yourself. - I'd probably like go out for something. - You go on. I'm fine really. Sergeant. Can't you even check Westfield out? - What do you want me to do? Excuse me, Mr. Westfield, but you're under arrest because Katie Common things you don't like her. And we all know social workers don't have enemies. So you've got to be the one. I can't even lift a finger without hard evidence. Don't give me that righteous look, please. When you've been through it as many times as I have establishing sleepovers. - I've already given up on sleep. - Hey, watch this. - Good idea, for real. - Yeah. - Thanks. - Okay. - So, after I had some time to think about it, I thought it would be better if... - I'm sorry, I had an emergency. Kate Carlin, I'm Cindy's social worker. - Take a seat Miss Carlin and we'll continue with the proceedings. - Thank you. - Cindy, you've had some time to think. - Yeah. And why thought it would be, the baby would be better off with the Strickland and steady with me. - You know that after today, you won't be able to change your mind again. - Cindy? - Miss Carlin? - I'm sorry, your honor, but something is wrong. This hearing is to petition to get the baby back. - Petition has been withdrawn Miss Carlin, we're continuing adoption proceedings. - Excuse me, your honor, may I speak to Cindy? Cindy, aren't you? Don't you still want the baby back? Were you threatened in any way? - Your honor, I resent the implication of any wrongdoing on the part of my clients. - Mr. Westfield. It's a valid question. You can answer Cindy, don't be afraid. - What do you mean? - Did someone say that they would hurt you or the baby? If you tried to get her back? - Your honor, this is ridiculous. - No, no one threatened me. - Your honor, I have reason to believe that the Strickland's may be unsuitable parents. - Your honor, if Miss Carlin had bothered to get here on time, my clients would have been spared the embarrassment for accusations. - Miss Carlin, we have character references, medical and psychiatric reports. Mr. and Mrs. Strickland have been interviewed twice by the Department of Adoptions and appear to be suitable parents. - What may I please speak to the interviewer from adoptions? - No. Mr. Osborn or the department reviewed the case and interviewed Cindy twice in the past 10 days. It's all here. - Well, your honor, as long as we have the approval of the department and the natural mother, I see no need to waste the court's time. - Cindy, for the record, please, you agreed to the adoption. - Yes, sir. - Mr. Osborn, you or someone from your department will conduct a follow up interview with the adoptive parents within 90 days and file the findings with this court. The adoption can proceed. This court is adjourned. Congratulations, everyone. - To get to a Westfield, - Miss Carlin, I have put together a lot of families, lonely couples, unwanted babies, as my file is full of grateful letters, family portraits, it's very rewarding. - Attaching, and it's heartwarming feeling that you have how quickly would you give it up if the profits weren't so high? - Oh, by the way, I convinced the Strickland's not to file against you. - You know what you are Westfield. You're really ticked off at me Archer. - How did you get in here? - Security building. Come on, give me a break. - A break. Give me a break. You begged me to help you. You cried and you moaned and you dragged me into this. I put my job on the line. I nearly got killed on the freeway. made a fool of myself, break the law, and you do what you did today without even warning me? Now you want to break? - Okay, I'm sorry. That smile doesn't do it anymore, kid. - Listen, I'm pregnant. - Did anyone ever explain birth control to you? - Sure. Well, Joey, isn't it was cool. Why should I believe you're 14 and you're you're 14. - You're only 14. - Now you're starting to sound like my mother. I mean, she's always getting mad at me because of Joey but she's the one that's got all the guys. I mean, I remember when we lived in this trailer park. She's come in in the middle of the night and wake me up, and I take my little pillow and my little blanket and I take it into the other room, and I lie on the floor, but I could never get to sleep because all I could do is hear her in there. Listen, Kate, maybe I just grew up a little too fast. I don't know. She always the only God ever been with like that. I wouldn't do it if I didn't love him. - Cindy, you didn't hear me? I wasn't putting you down, but you are just 14 years old. You're bright, you're beautiful. You got your whole life ahead of you. Don't settle. You don't have to. - Thanks. Oh, thank you for that. - So what are you going to do about this baby? Let me ask you something about Mrs. Strickland. You knew she had serious emotional problems, didn't you? - Yeah, but Westfield said that she's seeing a shrink until she gets used to having a baby in the house. - So, at the hearing, Westfield did know that you were pregnant? - And yeah, I guess so. I guess my mom told I mean she's scared home not though. Do I hate him? - Cindy, I hate Westfield too but I can't do anything unless you help me, will you do that? - What's your name? What everybody go to think it's right, baby. And Alex and the other girls like He's hungry at my pace for the alarm I came for supporting her for 1940 years on rock candy Hello Are you trying to get Nancy through Why didn't you call Don't yell at me, I couldn't find I should have waited, could have been hurt so I care what a team huh you okay you are getting what you needed evidence are suspended.

Tami's backstairs when you come on in, everybody, this is Kate Carlin from social services Am I told you about? Yeah. All right now they've already announced that the plane from Phoenix will be 10 minutes late. Let's review that so that we can intercept at the other end of the runaway and replace Mr. And Mrs. Bogner with Carolyn MC. He'll get everything on tape. And I get the word we get what's happening, man, it's gonna be a little late How nice to see you have a good time. Fine. Very nice. That's good. This is Mr. Mrs. Bogner mighty partners. It's gonna be touchy and feel safer with pros down there there's your little girl. I wonder if we could do this quickly. Mr. West feel a little tired. Oh, cause perhaps we should go into the coffee shop where we can do the paperwork. Okay. Want to go to the coffee shop? I'd rather not, if you don't mind. All right. How about over here? You're gonna want to sit down to sign this. She came through and let's keep our fingers crossed. They're both lovely nervous. She's older than we thought. We We expected a newborn on hell she bring that up. Bring when she doesn't like the baby. She's nine weeks. But it's a very special case Mrs. Wagner. See both parents were killed in a car accident. Grandparents on the mother's side are old friends of mine. They're the legal guardians. They felt that the child would be better off if raised by a younger couple. And frankly, I think the constant reminder of their own little girl it's too much for them. She's angry. Keep it cool. Keep it cool. Can we take her now? It's all yours. Can I speak to you hold on just a moment. This is it. I think. Don't blow it but I would like to go over the figures just so there's no misunderstanding. Mr. Wagner, it seems hardly necessary. It's just good business Mr. Westfield. Alright, if you wish. Let's see there were three payments of $5,000 each. That's total $15,000 which I've already received, right? All expenses were 5000 Plus my fee which is 10,000. So that's an additional $15,000 which you should have now. payable on delivery of the infant in cash. Here it is. Thank you Mr. Westfield. Thank you Mr. Barton. You're under arrest Mr. West, Mrs. Bog sorry attorney, Attorney presbytery question if you so desire and cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed. Do you understand these rights as I have given them to
