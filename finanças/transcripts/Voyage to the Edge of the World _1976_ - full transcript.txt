[GAS HISSING] [SPEAKING FRENCH] [GAS HISSING] [MUSIC PLAYING] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): December 5. I commit "Calypso" to the perilous Drake Passage that lies between the extreme tip of South America and the Antarctic Peninsula. For safety, we depend on space age techniques. RADIOMAN: "Calypso," "Calypso,"-- JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): Directly from three satellites, we receive pictures indicating storms and the ice situation in our area. -"Calypso." Good morning, here at sea. We read you loud and clear. Over. JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): Another satellite, at an altitude of 22,000 miles, connects us by radio to the outside world. [SPEAKING FRENCH] -Pictures from a weather satellite show that a storm is moving westward in the Drake Passage, between Cape Horn and the Antarctic Peninsula. [SPEAKING FRENCH] PHILIPPE COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): As there is usually such a storm in the Drake ever three days, and our crossing will take four, there is no way to avoid 24 hours of bad weather. I decide to go. [MUSIC PLAYING] The wind, about 20 knots, is not yet alarming. But the swell is rising and the clouds are low. The whole atmosphere is threatening. The albatrosses are at home here. But at the approach of these polar seas, I feel alien. [SPEAKING FRENCH] PHILIPPE COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): In the afternoon of December 7, the wind turns to southeast and reaches 45 knots. The sea is rough. But I am happy to feel my "Calypso," although overloaded with equipment and supplies, ride out the waves like a seagull. I have promised a traditional bottle of rum to whomever would spot the first iceberg. At dawn on the fourth day, Roger Boneau and Albert Falco win the prize. [MUSIC PLAYING] These mountains of ice may be majestic, but they are dangerous for navigation Icebergs and ice blocks drift by, one after another, endlessly. Pushed by westerly winds and currents, some of them have probably circled all around the Antarctic continent. The oldest ones, half melted, having capsized several times, present fantastic shapes in extraordinary shades of blue. I decide to drop anchor in the bay of King George Island. JACQUES COUSTEAU: [SPEAKING FRENCH] [PLAYING MUSIC] [BUZZ] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): It is snowing when we land in Leopard Seal Cove. With us is Dr. Raymond Duguy of the Paris Museum of Natural History. JACQUES COUSTEAU: [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): How long has it been since this cabin was visited last? This was obviously a meteorological station. After the explorers, came the scientists. Weather observations were essential for climate studies and to safeguard ships that ventured into this region. People have suffered here to serve mankind. But today, their work is done far better by satellites, without risking human lives. Snow has penetrated everywhere. But here are mattresses' books, once read; cans of food still unspoiled; and on a table, condiments left behind. For 13 years, the building has been unattended. Yet it is as if it were only yesterday. Antarctica preserves everything. But one feels that here life hangs only by a thread. Nearby, on a windswept promontory of ice and rocks, a line of tombs, marked by weathered, wooden crosses. JACQUES COUSTEAU: [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): Four young Englishman lost their lives here. The crosses evoke all who have died for knowledge in Antarctica. Pensive, we walk down toward the deserted shore. In spite of her modern equipment, today "Calypso" appears to me, very fragile. [RUMBLING] December 9th, weather is improving. From the helicopter pad, newly assembled on the stern of "Calypso," I take off with our pilot, Bob McKegan. 200 years ago, Captain Cook wrote that nowhere had he observed so much life as in these polar seas. That life, what has become of it today? I am happy to find that entire islands are still inhabited by immense colonies of penguins, by the hundreds of thousands. [MUSIC PLAYING] Out in the open sea, I spot a large group of seals. On my way back, I have the incredible luck to spot a couple of whales. They are humpback whales. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): Alerted by radio, the crew watches for the whales. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): Hunted without mercy, the humpbacks have become very rare. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): During our entire voyage, we will see no more. [BELL CLANGING] [SPEAKING FRENCH] [RUMBLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): It's a mother whale and her calf, that is perhaps four or five month old, but still a baby in need of protection. [MUSIC PLAYING] Before she's disappears, our whale extends on of her long pectoral flippers, as if to wave goodbye. [MUSIC PLAYING] The beach presents a vision out of Dante, an appalling ossuary. It was on land that former whalers cut up their victims. Hundreds of whale jaws, a multitude of ribs and vertebrae, are scattered on the ground. We become amateur paleontologists. Under the supervision of Dr. Duguy, we attempt to reconstruct the skeleton of a big blue whale. The skull alone weighs more than 800 pounds. The whole team is needed to move it. [SQUAWK] For Dr. Deguy, it is a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): The rostrums of the upper jaws average 15 feet in length. These animals, the largest that ever existed, are beautiful, peaceful, and intelligent. Their last survivors are still ingloriously slaughtered by butchers, to be transformed into oil and food for dogs and cats. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): This is narwhale, almost a fossil, a 90-foot monument to the folly of man. It's a big thrill on board, as Philippe, Bonnici, [INAUDIBLE] put on their new dry suits for their first Antarctic dive. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): Other mammals that return to the sea are protected from cold by a thick layer of blubber. As a substitute for fat, we inflate out outer skin with air. [HISSING] "Calypso" is the first ship ever to carry an expedition devoted exclusively to the undersea exploration of the Antarctic waters. Philippe will film all our dives and comment on them. PHILIPPE COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): To me, the mountains of ice are imposing, but somehow fixed, impassive, sterile. Could it be the same in the water? The cold that petrifies the sea, has it also killed all life within? The cold, I have been thinking of it since our departure. [SPEAKING FRENCH] PHILIPPE COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): We dive in fairly muddy water. The iceberg is stranded. Winds and waves drive the ice blocks across the shoals like huge plows, digging large furrows of destruction. I think that all the flat bottoms around Antarctica undergo that plowing to depths of at least 300 fathoms. The red algae gives us a waving, inviting welcome. Along a cliff, down to 100 feet, we discover an unexpected profusion of life. Here, beauty becomes delicate and warm. [MUSIC PLAYING] We glide among murky bouquets, amazed, filled with joy. It seems incredible that this icy water can nourish such abundance. What a contrast to the surface, so stark, so barren, so simple. JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): A group of penguins are drifting slowly on an eroded ice block. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): This raft of ice is deeply furled, indicating that it has been long used by the penguins as a hunting base. They have been traveling abroad all winter long. [SPLASH] As the mating season approaches, their breeding instinct compels them to swim back to their rookeries. [SPLASHING] They swim like porpoises. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SPLASHING] With the coming of the Antarctic summer, the ice breaks up and reveals the shore. The penguins, of an age to mate, from four to 12 old, return, in spite of the breakers, to the very location where they were born. Because of their oneness with the sea [BARK] and because their powerful wings allow them fantastic vertical leaps, they are able to make their way through the surf without being crushed. [PENGUIN SQUAWKS] There is no segregation here. The chinstrap penguins, the Gentoos with their red beaks, the Adelies in their dinner jackets live together in peaceful coexistence. [PENGUIN SQUAWKS] [MUSIC PLAYING] The males arrive before the females. Sitting on their nests of stones, they vocalize madly to attract their mates. [PENGUIN CRIES] Penguins are essentially monogamous. Most of them remain faithful to their partners from one mating season to the next. The couples part when they go to sea. Now, after an eight-month separation, the female identifies her mate by his voice. The reunions are as passionate as the courtship rituals of the new fiances. [MUSIC PLAYING] [PENGUIN CRIES] [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): Some of the eggs have already hatched. [PENGUIN CRIES] The mother feeds her chick predigested shrimp. He seems to like it. Males and females take turns, feeding their progeny and fishing at sea. Newborn penguins are cold blooded. Parents, whose temperature is 100 degrees, incubate their young as carefully as they do their eggs. To keep feeding all the hungry little ones, the adults must go to the sea. On the slopes, there is an endless coming and going. [PENGUIN CRIES] The sharp-tooth leopard seal, one of their few enemies, awaits them at the water's edge. [PENGUIN SQUAWKS] It's only along the shoreline, in turbid water, that the leopard seal has a chance to seize a penguin by surprise. [PENGUIN CRIES] Falco keeps the peace. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): There will be no hunting today. After weeks of fasting on a nest, a penguin is famished. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): A fishing penguin is difficult to follow. At times these small birds, weighing only 10 to 12 pounds, can dart up to 25 miles an hour. Their sprightliness in the water makes them practically invulnerable. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): Philippe and his companions depart in a Zodiac, to film the penguins in slow motion, under water, as they hunt for krill. [MUSIC PLAYING] PHILIPPE COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): The krill, upon which penguins feed, as do seals and whales, is a mass of innumerable pink shrimps. They move swiftly, using only their tiny abdominal fins. And I can hardly keep up with them. The Antarctic produces over 100 million tons of krill every year. We swim in what used to be a whale pasture. REPORTER 1: Thank you very much, Professor Cousteau. This is [INAUDIBLE] for BBC London. JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): By satellite on board "Calypso," I hold an international press conference. REPORTER 2: I heard you tell the BBC correspondent that-- [SPEAKING FRENCH] REPORTER 2: [INAUDIBLE] for taking over the food left by the dead whales, or the lack of whales in Antarctic. -What I was saying is that the abundance of life in the Antarctic at the level of primary protection of the vegetable production is enormous. And the first beneficiaries of this production, with only one intermediary, which was the krill, the mass of little shrimps, red shrimps, which abound in this area, were the whales. Now, these whales have been decimated. There is only 6% of them left today, about. So that a tremendous amount of unused food is now used by less interesting forms of life, like starfish, for example. So that because of the poor management of man with the whales, there is a continuous waste of biologically resources in the ocean today. Over. [MUSIC PLAYING] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): It is the time of the skua. By instinct, penguins fear anything that comes from the sky. [BIRD CRIES] With the piercing eyes of an eagle, a skua soars over the nurseries, looking for an abandoned chick or a sick one. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRD CRIES] Our Adelie penguin has protected his baby courageously. The skua, having been repelled several times, now attempts to grab another chick, one that had moved away to die. He's forced to give it up, as the penguin, with fierce eyes and his neck feathers erect, drives him from his prey. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRD CRIES] The skua is persistent. But his perseverance is no match for the penguin. [MUSIC PLAYING] Michel Laval and Dr. Duguy have gone to search for fossils on King George Island. [BIRD CRIES] Two skuas charge them. The men fear for their eyes. [SPEAKING FRENCH] [BIRD CRIES] The dive attacks were only meant to chase away the intruders and protect the eggs. [BIRD CRIES] After the failure of her intimidation maneuvers, the female skua now sits firmly on her nest to defend it. Michel is responsive to the bird's distress. With gentleness and quiet persuasion, he tries to convey his good intentions. The bird calms down, gaining some confidence. Under her breast feathers, Michel can feel her still pounding heart. Here, at the frontier of Antarctica's lonely wastes, two different species, man and skua, brought together by chance, have come to tolerate each other. [MUSIC PLAYING] Michel leaves, knowing too well that such moments are merely brief exceptions to the laws of nature. [RUMBLING] In difficult weather conditions, the helicopter delivers me to a barren hill. I have been informed by radio that Michel Laval has found fossils here. -Hello. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): It is impossible that plants and trees could ever have grown in such frozen soil. However, here are fossilized leaves. They bear a striking resemblance to those found today in the forests of Patagonia. 170 million years ago, this land was part of Gondwanaland, a supercontinent. It was connected to India and South America. When that supercontinent broke up, Antarctica drifted toward the pole, where it was covered with ice. [CRASHING WAVES] [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): Without warning, within a couple of minutes, a furious wind strike us. It now reaches 80 miles an hour. The stern anchor does not hold. The ship is drifting. We could be carried to shore and wrecked on the rocks. We must act fast. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): The anchor winch is frozen. Our only chance is to tie to use the crane. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): Obviously, Leopard Bay is not a safe anchorage. We must move out as soon as possible. With Captain [FRENCH], we decided a better shelter will be found in Whalers Bay, Deception Island. The storm abated as fast as it arose. Our helicopter escorts us to Deception Island, sinister enough. It served as a base for the whalers at the time of the big massacres. At about 30 years ago, with the advent of factory ships, big, floating slaughter houses, Deception was abandoned. "Calypso" enters a narrow passage, flanked with sheer cliffs that whalers called Neptune's Bellows, Dragon's Mouth, or Hell's Caldera, a vast volcanic crater, dug out by a tremendous explosion and invaded the sea. The volcano is still active, about to explode at any moment. Between mountains of rocks, exhaling fumes, glaciers dotted with ashes slowly float to the sea. And although the snow [INAUDIBLE], it is the improbable wedding of fire and ice. [MUSIC PLAYING] Through clouds of steam, we perceive the ruins of a Chilean research station completely destroyed in 1969 by volcanic explosions. There have been three explosive eruptions on the island during the last five years. And each time, marine charts had to be modified. A climbing team, led by Michel Laval, has been improvised. Our aim is to reach and explore the deep fracture in a glacier that was blown up during the 1969 eruption. Michel Laval is an experienced mountain climber. The others, including Philippe, are novices. PHILIPPE COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): Our progress is difficult, on granuous, red, lukewarm lava. Everywhere, snow is melting and the soil is streaming with water, that turns it into mud. Within the cracks, it is so hot that water is vaporized. The entire side of the mountain appears to be covered with volcanic vomit. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): The fog makes it difficult for Michel Laval to find the right approach to the glacier. [SPEAKING FRENCH] PHILIPPE COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): Away from the warm lava flows, it gets cold, as the mist comes down from the summits and engulfs us. Visibility is poor. The subdued light hurts our eyes. The cold is becoming intense. [SPEAKING FRENCH] PHILIPPE COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): Using our compass, we try to avoid a field of cracks on the south, that I had spotted from the helicopter. Michel, first on the rope, constantly probes the snow for hidden crevasses. Here, the glacier must be at least 100 feet thick and the pattern of the cracks is treacherously irregular. We are apprehensive, tense. One more crevasse, much wider and deeper than the others. Michel probes for a long time. Then he goes over and immediately secures me. We follow Michel, doing exactly as he tells us. The feeling of malevolent spirits around us, of imminent drama, pervades me. If only that fog would lift. We descend toward the roots of the glacier. It is satanic, an inferno that has frozen over, exhaling fumes and steams, about to explode again. The flank of the glacier, blown out during the last explosion, displays layers of volcanic ash, that alternate with the snows of successive Antarctic winters. Like the growth rings in a tree trunk, these layers allow us to date past eruptions. They also indicate all the climactic changes, as far back as 1670. It will be 2:00 AM when we return to "Calypso," exhausted. [ROARING WINDS] [SPEAKING FRENCH - SINGING] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): The next day aboard "Calypso," it is Christmas Eve. [SPEAKING FRENCH - SINGING] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): [SPEAKING FRENCH], when the poet died. When the poet died, they buried his star in a great field of wheat. All his friends, all his friends, shed their tears. Michel was [INAUDIBLE]. And this was to be his last Christmas. December 28. Michel Laval lost his life in an accident, instantly killed by the tail rotor of the helicopter, while on the ground, close to the volcanic crevasse of Deception. Nature reclaimed him on the border of the unknown. [RUMBLING] A dreadful day. Throughout his life, Michel sought new horizons. For him, the world was to marvel about and to love. "Calypso's" flag is at half mast. It is my painful task to bring Michel's body back. In my soul, I was inclined to drop everything. But Philippe, who had become Michel's friend, offered to remain on the island of fire and ice and to continue the exploration until my return. Only his decision could bring some warmth back into my heart. [MUSIC PLAYING] For nine days, a shore team, left to themselves on that accursed island, will establish camp in the ruins of a British base and make extensive exploration dives all around Deception. Michel had been captivated by Antarctica, its rich seas, its waste of ice, its transparent beauty. All that lies ahead of us will be inseparable from the memory of Michel Laval. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SNORTING] These majestic living torpedoes are orcas, nicknamed killer whales, the most powerful predators of the seas. In Antarctica, large whales have become exceedingly rare. However, packs of killer whales still thrive. Each closely knit family includes several females, offspring from two generations, and a single large male, the leader and master, identified by his huge dorsal fin. They feed on fish and squid. Occasionally, they enrich their menu with seals. But they certainly don't deserve the epithet "killer," more than any other animal. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): January 16. We proceed to the Melchior Archipelago for refueling, essential before we venture further south. [SPEAKING FRENCH] [HORN BLOWING] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): Our providential supply ship is the [INAUDIBLE] of the Argentinian navy. [RUMBLING] [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): In a disquieting fog, our "Calypso" heads for regions that are increasingly unsafe. [MUSIC PLAYING] Progressing south, we have crossed the Antarctic Circle, 200 years and two days after British explorer James Cook first passed it in 1773. [INAUDIBLE] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): January 23, NASA warns us that towards the south, the Bering Southern Sea is frozen 120 nautical miles further north than last year. Fragments of ice increasingly obstruct our course. But the weather is fine. And we all want to reach seal country and dive under the ice pack there. Now, we are about to slip into another channel, flanked by cliffs of ice. 3:00 AM, the break of day. The low sun rays play through layers of polar air and create mirages and incandescent glows. But the blocks of ice that impede our progress are not mirages. Launches are dispatched ahead in an attempt to push the largest out of our way. [MOTOR RUMBLING] [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): The observation chamber in front of our stern is made of thick steel and acts as a bumper. But I fear our props and rudders that are not protected. [ENGINE RUMBLING] [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): Unsuccessfully, we struggle against the chaos of ice that is thickening. For the first time, I become worried. What if "Calypso" became surrounded with ice, to the point of being unable to move? [ENGINE RUMBLING] I think of Shackleton, whose sturdy ship, the "Endurance," was crushed like a nut in 1915. [SPEAKING FRENCH] [ROARING ENGINE] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): I send the helicopter on a reconnaissance flight. Bob McKegan and Philippe will look for a way out of the trap. They keep radio contact with the bridge. [RUMBLING] -We'll have to double back to the left. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): Philippe has located a navigable passage. "Calypso" and the helicopter will rendezvous near a very old iceberg grounded in the channel. [RUMBLING] [SPEAKING FRENCH] [RUMBLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): At last, we have found an access to free water, sprinkled only with [INAUDIBLE] ice. We all breathe a bit easier. We have gotten off lightly, with only a few scratches the hull. [MUSIC PLAYING] This magic bay, luminous, bathed with crystalline water, is seal country. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SEAL CRIES] -Hey, up. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): "Calypso" is made fast to the pack, as to a wharf and a harbor. Yet, I am concerned. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): The sea is freezing. Our launches try to churn lose the ice freezing around "Calypso," that could lock her in within a few hours. We must depart before nightfall. These improvised sleds, loaded with diving equipment, make me feel like we're playing explorers of old. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): The ice pack is cracking. We may not come back walking. We may need boats. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): To achieve such round, smooth holes, the Weddell seals gnaw through ice six feet thick. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): We will slightly enlarge two holes. Philippe and [INAUDIBLE] will be able to dive through one of them. And in a case of trouble, come back up through the other. Weddell seals are fantastic divers. They are able to stay under water up to an hour, to reach depths of 2,000 feet, and to swim under the ice for more than five miles. It's not quite the case with us. [SPEAKING FRENCH] PHILIPPE COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): The water below is dark, frightening. A strong current could sweep us far under the pack, away forever from these openings to life. [RUMBLING] Under the pack, seal songs endlessly resound. A Weddell seal gracefully slips into the water. I wonder how the seals are able to find their breathing holes again when that come up from their 2,000 foot dive. I know they have sonar systems emitting modulated sounds that compose the songs we hear. However, I cannot imagine any creature living at ease in this forbidding ream. JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): I am eager to take down the diving saucer, to explore the deeper polar waters. It's the first time ever that a submarine has been used in Antarctica. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): Falco will pilot the saucer while I film. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): At my disposal, I have a remote-controlled exterior camera mounted on a tripod. [RUMBLING] We dive alongside an iceberg to the bottom, where it is grounded at a depth of a thousand feet. As we reach the bottom, I am struck by the abundance of life. We advance through clouds of small fish. Immense starfish, with multiple arms, litter the rocks and the sediment. Probably dazzled by our lights, small fish bump into the starfish, get ensnared, and will be devoured. A strange, thin crab, all legs, proceeds as if in slow motion. He looks like a tall, bodiless spider. Our old friend the octopus seems to be as much at ease in these cold waters as in the Mediterranean. A blue fish, with white and black spots, like enameled shell, Falco checks to see if it is alive. [SPEAKING FRENCH] This incredible creature is a [INAUDIBLE]. The strange bowl, attached to the rock by a filament, is both a mouth and a digestive tract. It's worm-like extension, which measures over six feet, is covered with venomous cells, which paralyze shrimp before our eyes. It twists and curls around its prey and contracts slowly to bring the victims to its mouth. It's terrifying. A jelly-like creature, swinging like a Christmas bell. A pink snailfish waves lazily, digging out small prey from the diatomic ooze. [MUSIC PLAYING] Looming out of the depth, the favorite diet of Weddell seals, squid. The saucer's lights are affected by pigments within their translucent bodies, which are probably fluorescent. This is the first time that live squid have been observed in the Antarctic. Another species of squid, with wings of transparent gold. And now, the icefish. The elusive and almost legendary icefish, which has no red cells in its blood. Therefore, no hemoglobin to combine with oxygen and convey it. It is dissolved oxygen only, that is carried by the colorless liquid pumped by its heart. The icefish has never been filmed before in its natural environment. When the temperature goes below 29 degrees, the icefish releases into its blood a special protein, much like a driver puts antifreeze in his radiator. The teeming world we leave below thrives at the very edge of life. In water one or two degrees colder, nothing would survive. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): Falco aims upward the jet nozzles that propel the saucer, thus indicating our location to "Calypso," so we can be hoisted out of a rapidly freezing sea. Summer is at end. And we know that the season changes here are drastic. But we want to go on with our work for as long as we can. On route to Esperanza, Hope Bay. At the entrance of the Weddell Sea, "Calypso" makes her way between islands, reefs, and icebergs. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): Like a yo-yo, a hammock of ice bobs, vacillating in resonance with a long swell. [SPEAKING FRENCH] [BIRD CRIES] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): It's snowing. The temperature, both in the sea and in the air, has dropped abruptly. Studying the charts, with regret I prepare our return. I did not suspect that this field snowfall would soon turn into a fierce blizzard. In the meantime, Philippe and Falco organize the last dives before beyond the onslaught of winter. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): Nobody on board yet realizes the urgency of our situation. [SPEAKING FRENCH] [LAUGHTER] [MOTOR RUMBLING] The Zodiac sails away on the sea blanketed by a snow that does not melt. As I see them go, I feel vaguely apprehensive. PHILIPPE COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): We land on an ice floe, already occupied by a few young ones. As children do, they play catch with the snow as it falls. [PENGUIN CRIES] [SPEAKING FRENCH] PHILIPPE COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): Equipped for our dive, we walk across the ice raft to the water. An unusual vision in the Antarctic, red penguins. [PENGUIN CRIES] The snow is falling even more heavily. It is with relief that I escape the snow and slip into the sea. It is so cold that snow sticks to the camera. Is does not even melt on contact with the water. We swim under a translucent canopy, between columns of ice, in a world with no shadows. [SPLASHING WAVES] Soon the penguins join us and offer a fantastic display of underwater agility. [MUSIC PLAYING] [PENGUIN CRIES] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): The divers are back aboard. A long, smooth swell is up now, with no wind, a bad omen. February 9, the barometer is falling and the birds are flying away. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): All of a sudden, the wind has come up. In five minutes, it reaches 65 miles per hour. The wind is pushing the icebergs towards the entrance of the deep, narrow bay. And they are all drifting toward "Calypso." A gigantic mass of ice, many times the weight of "Calypso," is on a collision course with us. And there is nothing we can do. [RINGING] [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): I know "Calypso" has been severely injured. I send Falco below to assess the damage. Meanwhile, [INAUDIBLE] continues his futile efforts against the relentless assaults. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): When Falco returns, the wind is stronger than ever. And also by now, it has driven most of the icebergs towards away from us and toward the open sea. The damage has been done. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): Falco reports that not only is the starboard propeller bent, but the shaft of the port propeller is broken. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): It is even more serious than I thought. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): The shaft cannot be repaired. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): The blizzard is just beginning and it is turning day into night. There's no visibility. In waters too deep to cast an anchor, day after day we circle helplessly in the narrow bay, on our single bent propeller. Without radar. we would be wrecked. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): On the third day, the wind goes up to 100 knots, 120 miles an hour. Already loaded with snow, "Calypso" is lashed by a freezing spray that makes her even heaving. [MUSIC PLAYING] At last, the storm abates. And I have my first opportunity to check out our poor ship. The deck is heavily loaded with snow and ice. All riggings are covered with thick frost. The winch is a mass of ice and most certainly could not operate. The diving saucer, unrecognizable, has been turned into a large, white egg. With one injured propeller and a hole in the hull our trip back seems very much in doubt. "Calypso" has a 5 degree starboard list. I estimate she's loaded with about 30 tons of snow and ice. She's dangerously top-heavy and could possibly capsize if a storm hit her again. Meanwhile, we begin digging out our ship. [SCRAPING] [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): The hole in her hull, two feet above the waterline, is temporarily sealed. The rear anchor chain is freed. If we are to proceed at all, out of this bay, the divers must perform a difficult task. They have to fasten the broken shaft so that it does not ram into the port rudder and disable us completely. From one diver to the next, signals are relayed to [INAUDIBLE], who operates the winch. And a shaft is secured by a strong tackle. [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): The depression is moving away. It is time to start the motor and leave this dismal bay. The exit of the Weddell Sea is strangely calm, an atmosphere of slumbering threat. Here, icebergs, driven by unpredictable squalls and suddenly freezing seas, have destroyed many ships. All at once, the face of a glacier collapses. The cliffs are undermined and cracked by the repeated freezings and thawings that occur at the end of summer. [RUMBLING ICE] A large section of the cliff falls near Philippe's Zodiac, raising a mountain of water. It is time we left the coast and escaped to the open sea. Along with danger and drama, Antarctica offers us magnificent days that no one on board will ever forged. [PLAYING MUSIC] [SPEAKING FRENCH] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): It is a great, white sphinx, recalling the Egyptian monster, with its human head and the body of a reclining lion. It is grounded. But if tossed by the swell, it could break up or capsize. [SPEAKING FRENCH] PHILIPPE COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): One has to come close to the sphinx to realize the enormity of its mass. It is so vast and heavy that the powerful swell breaks on it, as on a coastline. The waves charge into caves at the base of the giant. 100 feet away, from a concealed tunnel, the water spouts out. The entire structure is a labyrinth of passages and caves. I think of the thousands of years necessary to accumulate snow into such a gigantic block. Then how many years of Sun, of waves, of cold, and of storms were needed to carve out this mass and make it what it is today? [SPEAKING FRENCH] PHILIPPE COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): We will try to board the island of ice. We use the swell as a lift to attain a grasp. [SPEAKING FRENCH] PHILIPPE COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): Christian is the first to climb the slippery wall. He is followed by Dominique, and then helps Raymond and me. At any moment, under inside stresses of fantastic magnitude, the colossal sculpture could explode, disintegrating to innumerable pieces, annihilating "Calypso" and all of us. The thought obsesses me. The iceberg is alive. [ENGINE RUMBLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SPLASHING SEAWATER] I need more intimacy with the iceberg. From the Zodiac, we discover a fragile cave, an opening into the giant. At close range, one can see that the corridor reaches deep into the heart of the sphinx. At the end of the narrow passage, lies a basin of dark, therefore deep water, probably connected to the open sea. As soon as we're equipped, we slide into it. The basin extends into a vertical well, irregularly shaped, that leads us, 60 feet below, to a terrace on the flank of the iceberg. There, everywhere, the ice is corrugated by thousands of small depressions. The exact symmetry of design and embossment is incredible. The ice, filled with small air bubbles, is smooth and bright. It was the encounter of freshwater ice and salted sea water that created this improbable surface. Jutting out of the cliff, a sword of ice, the blade transparent as crystal. A little lower, an opening gapes in the wall. Within the entrails of the sphinx, dull, cracking sounds, and alarming fissures are warnings that the iceberg is under immeasurable internal stress. My curiosity is stronger than my apprehension. We are in a natural hall of mirrors. One cannot resist caressing the smooth surfaces that dazzlingly reflect our lights. We leave behind the cascading echoes of our bubbles within the palace of ice. [BUBBLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Farther down, below a ledge, we discover sheaths of frozen air bubbles, like showers of diamonds. Dominique plays with his light, like a magician. Everything here is made of air and water, water liquid, water solid, water pure and water mixed with air, air that is trapped in microscopic bubbles, shining like pearls, stars, or comets. Our light beams penetrate deep into the transparent ice, revealing the secrets of the iceberg's past. For hundreds of thousands of years, while the iceberg was still part of a glacier, every storm, every winter and summer, was engraved in its heart. Now in the sea, it is a giant crystal, melting under my eyes. We are witnesses to the vanishing of an eternity. [MUSIC PLAYING] JACQUES COUSTEAU (VOICEOVER): In spite of her wounds, "Calypso" has carried us to our greatest and most daring adventure. We were in quest of the unknown, but rediscovered what our ancestors once knew, harmony and purity on our planet. [MUSIC PLAYING] We have confirmed that the southern polar waters are the richest of the world's oceans. May this continent, the last expelled by man, be the first one to be spared by man. May, out of the errors of the past, rise a dawn of respect and love for the free-living creatures and pristine beauty of the last virgin land on Earth, Antarctica. [MUSIC PLAYING]
