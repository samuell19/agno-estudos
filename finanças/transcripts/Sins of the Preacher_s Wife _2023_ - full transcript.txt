When Ruth sees this painting at the art gallery, she is going to lose her mind. What do you think, Cass? Cassie? Cassie. Cassie! No. Cassie! You okay? Has she been fussing a long time? Barely started up. But your mom ears are in full effect. I've always been a light sleeper, Dan. True, medically, when you become a mother, your sleep cycles change. I didn't medically become a mother. I can't have kids remember. Situationally, it, it's, it's really the same thing. Just... Can we just stop diagnosing me? I'm not your patient. Okay, okay, all right. It's the force of habit. [disquieting music] Is it a nightmare? What? Well, you're making a lot of sounds in your sleep. It's, it sounded like a nightmare, but, you know, here I go again diagnosing. It wasn't a nightmare. Look, I'll be fine, don't worry. Oh, honey. Here we are. Welcome to Willowvale. God, oh, you scared me. I scared you? Yeah, I just jumped outta my skin. Didn't you see me? I gotta go to the clinic. What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing? I, I just put my hand on your shoulder, you acted like I was an ax murderer. Well, I guess you married a crazy lady then. Hon-- What? This house is a little creepy, don't you think? No, I, I happen to think it's quite nice, actually. I mean, look at it. We live eight miles away from humans. Dan, we've been here two weeks and I've seen the same squirrel twenty times. And I'm starting to imagine people outside in the bushes. Aren't you the one who wanted to get outta the city? Yeah, I wanted to leave our neighborhood, but not escape life itself. You said you wanted to go somewhere safe and be closer to nature. Well, look, there's nature and this is small-town-safe. Well, then, I guess I'm happy, huh? Ugh, I'm sorry. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm just worried about her. She never reaches for me. [Beth] I don't know. Hey, look, I'm your mom. You're supposed to reach for me. [Dan] She loves you, honey. I didn't say she didn't love me. Look, you just, you gotta get out there. Start talking to some people, you know, be a part of the community. I do talk to people, okay? The grocery store counter people, sales people. That's not what I'm talking about, you know it. -Oh, you think so. -Yeah, yeah. I love you and I just, I, I want you to be happy. That's it. I am happy. I'll see you later. Do you wanna go shopping, little girl? I know, me neither. But it won't take that long. A couple errands and then we're gonna be right back. Do you feel like we're being watched or am I losing my mind? That's what you always say. You know your mom isn't crazy, I promise. And I'm gonna do like your annoying daddy says, and try to be happy. [sighs] Alright, let's back up. Great job. Good job, ooh, you're getting so big. Yeah. Here we go. In you go. In you go, good job. [Beth sighs] Oh, God. Can I help you? Look, I, I have mace in my purse. Your purse is in the back seat. [Beth] Are you threatening me? You should leave here. Well, I'm trying, but you're in my way. I don't mean here. I mean here. Look, you need to get outta my face or I'm gonna put this key in your eye. I'm trying to tell you something important. You don't belong here. Bad things will happen to you here. Bad things will happen to her. Get away from my baby, you psychopath. [tin clattering] You're not listening. This place isn't for you. It isn't for your kid. It isn't for your husband. You don't belong here. Okay. I'm, I'm just, I'm just trying to tell you the truth. I'm just trying to tell you. -Like, really strange-- -[police siren chirps] [Beth grunts] [Police car door slams] You all right, ma'am? No, this man is threatening me, officer. I didn't want her to fall, Tim. You need to arrest this psychopath. I don't know about that, ma'am. What do you mean "you don't know about that"? This man is threatening me because, I don't know, because he's crazy. [Sheriff] Boyd, are you threatening this woman? I didn't want her to fall. Wait, why are you asking him? I'm telling you what happened. From your point of view. Because he was threatening me. Do you guys not have this word in your vocabulary? Threatening. We have that word, ma'am. You're just letting him go? Ma'am, look-- No, don't "ma'am" me, officer. Sheriff, not officer, ma'am. Excuse me, Sheriff. What is going on around here? This is a small town, ma'am. We all know each other around here. We don't jump at the least little thing. The least little thing? Oh, my God. And we don't take the Lord's name in vain. We're not like the city people moving here with their problems and drugs. We don't like problems and drugs around here. Well, that's a shame because I love problems and drugs, officer. Have yourself a nice day, ma'am. Thanks for your help. Listen to me, Dan. I had a panic attack on the way home and nearly drove off the road. Hon. No, don't "hon" me. We need to get out of this town. I am just trying to say that maybe you are overreacting. I don't overreact, Dan. We have moved three times, Beth. First the condo's bad, then the suburbs are bad. And now you, you just, you cannot fault me for thinking that maybe there is something else besides just one, admittedly very bad, confrontation. It wasn't a confrontation. He threatened me. I, I understand that, okay, I do. But we just sunk a lot of money into this clinic. You're choosing the clinic over your family. I am not choosing the clinic. If we really must move-- We must. Okay, fine. But that cannot happen this second. It can't. So in the meantime, why don't we look into getting you a therapist. A therapist? Are you kidding me? I know how you feel about therapy, but these panic attacks that you were having, they are getting worse. Fine. Okay, fine. I will go to therapy and they can pump me full of meds like my parents did when I was 13 years old if it will just get us out of this hell hole. Okay? [Dan] Okay. [door thudding] So Beth, what's going on? I hate this town. I hate the people in this town. And my husband demands I do therapy. Have you had any difficult incidents recently? Yeah. I moved here. Apart from that. Um... [sighs] I don't know, I had an altercation at the grocery store the other day, I guess. What was that? Um... Nothing, I... I-I'm sorry. Sorry for what? Beth? You alright? Um... Uh... I'm so sorry, I just, I really can't do this. Careful! Are you okay? The ice will help with the swelling. Thanks. It's okay? Yeah. Did you do the fairytale paintings? I did. Do you like paintings? Well, I'm a painter, in theory. And what are you, in practice? A jaywalker. Yeah, I've been meaning to paint some more, but who has the time? Also, the really early fairy tales had these wonderful heroines, you know? They did things. They were active. Not like those ones who fall asleep hoping that Brad Pitt knocks on their window or whatever. Yeah, I guess. Yeah, they went out and they grabbed life, right? Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty? Please. Now, Adamantina, now there's a heroine. She goes to the market to sell her sister's homespun thread, but instead she trades it for a beautiful little doll she wants bad. Bad choice? Obviously, her sister is beside herself. Adamantina just gave away everything they have in the world. But as it turns out, the doll is magical and it grants them wish after wish after wish. She even marries a prince. But that's not why she bought the doll. No, she bought it because it's what she wanted. She took what she wanted. Now there's a lesson for any little girl, don't you think? Yeah. Yeah, I guess. How's your elbow feel now? [sighs] It hurts a little, but I'll be all right. I-I'm sorry, I, I don't think I got your name. Oh, my goodness. I've been talking, talking, I didn't even tell you my name. I'm Marion. I'm the preacher's wife and I, uh, run the daycare. I'm Beth. It's nice to meet you, Beth. So do you commit suicide every day, or just on Wednesdays? No, no, that's not what I was doing. Oh, no, I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. But that is a really good way to get flattened, to walk in front of a car. It was a mistake. I was just distracted. Oh, I understand. Believe you me. But I saved your life. So now we get to be friends. Isn't that nice? Yeah. Um, look, thank you again for everything. Yeah, well small towns can be challenging. Yeah. The people can be. Well, let me tell you, I'm not from around here. And the transition was rough. Yeah. I wanted to escape into the woods more than once. Anyway, I think your elbow's gonna be fine. So you can go about your way. Thanks again. Well, take care Beth. And if you ever need to talk, I make the best poppy seed pie in the entire universe. And I'm always here, among the angels. Well, I might have to take you up on that. Thanks. Oh, is that for me? Here, ah. Ah. Mmm. Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. [laughs] No, you have some, come on, come on. This is for you, this is for you. This is for you. Oh, are we gonna start wearing this spaghetti, or we gonna eat it? Honey, if you don't eat before Mommy gets home, Daddy's gonna get in trouble. And you know what happens when Daddy gets in trouble? Oh, okay. I think we, we're missing, we're... Okay, what if I do like a little like... [imitating a plane] You don't like it? You don't like it? Look, Dad slaved away over this spaghetti for at least like five minutes, so... Hey, you must've had a lot to say. It's just, 'cause the appointment, it took forever. Oh, no, we didn't... I mean, yeah, we just mostly filled out paperwork. Oh, okay. I'm sure we'll get deeper next time. Yeah, all right, I just, I just want you to be happy. You're sweet. Yeah, and very, very late. So, sorry for the mess, right, honey? She's very sorry about the mess. I'll see you in a bit. [Anna imitating a plane] Okay. Hi. Wow, you didn't even wear a bib or anything. He just gave it straight to you. Okay. Okay, here we go. Yeah. Hi, hon. Dan? Yeah. Hon, are you there? Someone is outside. What do you mean? Someone is outside the house? I think it's that weird guy from town. You think you saw someone outside, or you did see someone outside? I saw somebody outside in the bushes looking at me through the window. Look, Dan, please come home. If you think you saw someone outside, you should call the police. No, I'm not gonna call the sheriff, that guy's crazy. He's not gonna do anything. Dan, just please come home. Honey, I am, I, I'm just about to leave. Dan, please. Okay. Okay, I'll call the sheriff. Oh, you think if you call the sheriff that's gonna change anything, well, he's probably cousins with that guy or something. You don't believe me, do you? I didn't say that. You didn't have to say anything, Dan. Everything that you're doing is showing me exactly what you think and how you feel. Look, do you know, you want me to choose how I'm feeling? That I feel unhappy all the time and scared all the time. You think I'm choosing this? Look, I, my gut is telling me that there's something wrong with this town. Okay, I, I, I understand. And I'm leaving. Oh, my God. Beth, what's wrong? Oh, my God. Beth. -[tense music continues] -[Beth panting] [suspenseful music] -[suspenseful music continues] -[Beth panting] [suspenseful music continues] [person knocking] [suspenseful music continues] [Beth quietly] Marion? [knocking] [Beth] Oh. Hi. Hi, there, honey. [Beth] Ah, what are you doing here? Well, you never came by for that pie, so I thought I'd bring it to you. Oh. How did you know where we lived? There's only so many people in this town. Are you having a very scary surprise party? I thought I saw someone outside. Well, you did, me. Oh, I doubt you were hiding in the bushes. Well, yeah, that doesn't sound like me to me, but I don't know. You worried, honey? Do you wanna go check it out? Sure. Okay. [Marion] Let's go. [disquieting music] [insects chirping] -[insects continue chirping] -[disquieting music] [Marion] You think somewhere around here? Um, yeah, I think so. Hmm, well, trust your instincts. He was here? Yeah. Are you looking for footprints? My dad used to be a hunter, yeah. Not a very good shot, but a hell of a tracker. I don't know. Maybe we should just check in the daylight. Yeah. [disquieting music] [insects chirping] [disquieting music] I mean, I am nuts. I have completely lost it. I'm starting to imagine people in my backyard. Well, maybe whoever he is is really good at covering his tracks. Would you believe me if I told you that? I would. But I'm very trusting. Maybe I should work on that. Well, you get it by giving it. [Beth laughs] What? Get it by giving it? Ooh, you dirty minded thing. [Beth] What can I say? It's good to see you laughing. Well, this pie, wow. That's what he said. Mm, I see what you did there. I keep calling you 'cause you hung up. I thought something had happened. Oh, babe, I'm so sorry. Um, this is Marion. -Hi, I'm Marion. -How are you? -Hi, nice to meet you. -We're, we're fine. It was just a misunderstanding. Okay. All right, it's good. You ladies have a pie. Sorry, I gotta go catch my breath. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. He cares. He's so sweet. [Beth] I know. I'm gonna have to get that recipe from you. -Oh, absolutely, yes. -It was so good. Nice car. Oh, please call the grandma police. I got a nice truck at home though. It's my baby. Well, one of my babies. How you feeling about your baby? What? That bad? Uh, no, not bad. I, I love her. You know how it is. How is it? She's, I don't know if you know this, but she's adopted. Oh, no. I, I didn't realize that. Whoa, well, that's wonderful. Yeah, yeah, it's, it's great. Amazing. All I ever wanted was to be pregnant and have a smashing art career. But when that didn't work out, she kind of, kind of fell right into our laps. But it is hard, I mean. Sometimes I feel like we don't connect, you know? I don't know, but talking to you makes me feel better. But maybe it was the pie. [both laughing] But seriously, thank you for everything. I really appreciate it. Oh, please, it's nothing. No, really, it means a lot. If you ever need anything or want anything, just let me know. I just want you to be happy and maybe come by the church sometime. Oh, it's a lovely community. And you can meet my husband and I run a daycare like nobody's business, which I think your precious little one would just love. We're not really religious. Neither is daycare, but it would give you some time to paint. And if you're worried about Dan's reaction, then just tell him that you're gonna take him to brunch and surprise him. That's what I would do. You're a very slick lady, Marion. You don't know the half of it. [disquieting music] [disquieting music continues] [Dan] All right, honey, this certainly doesn't look like brunch to me. I don't understand why- You said you want us to talk to people. This is the way for us to talk to people. Okay, well, if they're talking about God the entire time when we're in there-- It is church. Of course, they're gonna talk about God. Which is why I don't want to go. Oh, my gosh, are you just gonna complain the whole time? -Yeah, actually- -Sounds like somebody's first time to me. I don't know, call it a hunch. Hi, um, I'm Beth. Hi, Beth. This is my very grumpy husband, Dan. Don't worry about it, Dan. I understand completely. -And our daughter, Anna. -Yeah, nice to meet you. Well, hello there. Aren't you gorgeous? Say thank you. Why don't I walk you guys in? -Yeah, great. -That'd be great. [Jim] Don't worry, Dan. I came in kicking and screaming too. [Dan] Yeah? Man, how'd they get you to stay? [Jim] Well, why don't we just take a seat and listen and see. You're gonna be just fine. [Dan] I don't have to sing, do I? -Welcome. -Thank you very much. -Good to see you. -Good to see you too. [organ music playing] We're just not that into the whole church thing. Completely understand, Dan. -Yeah. -100%. Morning. [Anna babbling] Hello. Hey, Marion. I see you met my husband. We did, Dan's head is still spinning. Oh, she is so sweet. Come, come sit with me. [gentle music] Good morning. [Congregation] Good morning. Abby, lovely to see you here today. Joe, the beard is killing it, I see you're working on that. Chloe, glad you're feeling better. Wanna thank you guys for coming in today. You know, I just recently met somebody that said to me, "Yeah, I'm not really into the church thing." No, no. That's perfectly reasonable in my book. And I'll tell you why. If I'm being really honest. Really, really honest. I'm not always into the church thing either. And what I mean by that is I'm not always into worrying about whether or not the foyer way was vacuumed this morning. I'm not always into worrying about whether the chairs in the basement should be fixed or pitched. I'm not always interested in worrying about whether the parking crew is gonna be here on time. I'm not always interested in worrying about what I'm gonna do when the bake sale doesn't go off as we planned. But that stuff is church though. Just trying to answer everyday questions. But then there's the big questions, questions that tug on your heart. You know what I'm talking about. Questions that keep you up late at night. The questions that wake you up early in the morning. Those are the questions. Those are the questions that I'm interested in trying to answer. And I'm perfectly comfortable telling you guys that I don't have the answer to those questions. I'm searching. I'm searching just like you. But I believe that the Good Book is the pathway to the answers to those questions. I believe that I can choose to walk that pathway or not. I believe that I can choose to walk that pathway alone. And I also believe that I can choose to invite you to walk that pathway with me, and that my friends, that is the thing that I'm into about church. The togetherness, the "we", the walking hand in hand to find the answers to those big questions. So, Chloe, would you care to walk with me? How about you? Would you care to walk with me? How about you? Would you care to walk with me? You are a lady with a sleepy baby. -You wanna lay her down? -[Anna moaning] -We have a nap room. -Yes, please. Looks like they're gonna be a while. Marion, always good to see you. Good to see you too. Beth, my door is always open. -Hey. -[Anna moaning] [wine splashing] Her first nap's already wearing off. [Marion] They change fast. You gotta hang on for the ride, but not too tightly. I consider that a general rule. Yeah, I have a problem with letting things go. What things? It's okay. You can tell me. [disquieting music] I had a friend that died. She died in the- In the woods? You make no bones about hating the woods. It's like you're mad at every tree God made. It doesn't take a genius to put two and two together. It's that obvious, huh? Hmm. Not at all. You got your secrets, girl. It's okay. I got mine too. I have quite the past myself. I, uh... I came to the church. I came to Jim after, well, a little bit too much living, if I'm being honest. I had my wild child days. I still think about them. Were you a wild girl, Beth? [scoffs] No. No, but I knew one. It's hard to be there for people sometimes. Yeah, it is. [phone jingles] [Beth laughs] My husband groused the whole way here, and now he wants to have drinks with Jim. He wants a play date. He wants a play date. Let's have some play dates then. Ah, I guess we need to schedule a play date. -[glasses clinking] -[Beth chuckles] [mysterious music] [mysterious music continues] [mysterious music continues] [doorbell rings] Oh. Hey, Marion. What's wrong, hon? The art hurting you? -Yeah. -Okay, let's go. Go where? Where I'm taking you. And where's that? You'll see. Where's Anna? She's with Dan. [Marion] Okay, why don't you go change? Okay. -[birds chirping] -[mysterious music] [Beth] Ah, yeah, I just feel like I'm always pushing a boulder up a hill. Like I need to break through, but I can't. I don't know, like something needs to snap into place or snap all together, I don't know. [birds chirping] Wait, where are we going? You'll see. Look, Marion, you know I'm not comfortable. Well, why would you be? It's the woods, you hate the woods. Yeah, exactly. Beth, if you want to beat your fear, you have to face it head on. There's no other way. You can't go around it. You can't go under it. You can't just ignore it. You have to go through it. I can see what you need because I'm on the high ground. I can see the forest clear and you need to go into it. [soft music] My husband and I almost bought that place for when we wanted to escape. We'd hide out here forever. And we wanted to, when we figured out we couldn't have kids. You are so lucky to have Anna. She's so sweet and beautiful and perfect. We would've done anything for her. The Lord giveth to some blessings, and to others, well, I consider it a trial. It's all about fortitude. You gotta hang on. Can you hang on? [gentle music] [gentle music continues] [gentle music] [Beth gasps] Oh, my God. What's wrong? [tense music] [Beth panting] It's just, it looks exactly like, uh... [Marion] Like what? -Like- -Come on, Beth. Don't give up. I can't, okay? I, I can't go in there. It's just a clearing in the woods. [Beth] No, I can't. Why? What happened? What did you do, Beth? I didn't do anything. I, I didn't do anything. So what happened to your friend? What happened, Beth, just, just say it? I didn't save her, okay? I didn't save her. I didn't go after her. [intense music] Did you ever have that friend that you meant everything to them and they meant everything to you? [Beth VO] We met when we were 12. We did everything together. Went everywhere together, we were inseparable. She was beautiful and talented and smart. An amazing artist, way better than me. And a little crazy. She would disappear and reappear and it was like we had this on again, off again relationship. Everybody thought that we were dating. Hell, we even joked that we were dating. And one day she just... disappeared for good. I thought we were done with all the back and forth. And then she called me, wanted to go camping and work everything out, so we did. And when we got there, she... told me that she liked me. And I told her that I was in love with her brother. She started begging me to be with anybody else. And then she just ran away, and I promised myself I wouldn't chase after her, that I wouldn't do that to myself anymore. So I went back to camp and went to bed. And the next morning I woke up and she wasn't there. Cass? [young Beth] Cass? So I went looking for her and that's, [sighs] that's when I found her. I didn't save her, I didn't go after her. You couldn't have saved that girl, Beth. I could have gone after her. Can you stop a freight train by standing in front of it? No. Can you slow it down some? Sure. But that's a high price to pay. Your friend Cass, God bless her, was headed in one direction. Some people are just built that way. They're lovely, they're charming, they're full of life, but they're weak. And you can't stop a weak person from being weak anymore than you can a strong person from being strong. I don't know. No, because you wanna blame yourself. You wanna pretend to be weak, but you're not weak. You're strong. You're afraid of the woods. You're afraid of town. You're afraid of your past. No, you're not, Beth. Not? No, you're afraid of your power. You're afraid that someone loved you and needed you and died because they did. Well, I don't want that kind of power. Do you think that that matters? Do you think that any of us have a choice? Do you think that we get what we want, what we deserve? No. You have to grab it. You have to go for it or you lose it. And that's just not the woods, that's life. That's the jungle. The weak are food. The strong survive. I don't know about that. Do you wanna just give up? Do you wanna leave that beautiful little baby behind? Or do you want to tell Cass that you wanna live? Tell her you can't help her anymore. Tell her goodbye. [poignant music] Goodbye, Cass. Yeah. No more crying. That's for the weak. [poignant music] [intense music] [intense music continues] [intense music continues] Shh, it's okay. Mommy and Daddy are busy. But I'm here. [intense music] [intense music continues] I'll stay with you. [intense music continues] [intense music continues] [intense music continues] [Dan] I'm just gonna get some water real quick. [Beth] No, that'll take too long. [Dan] Honey, um, well, I'm already up, I'm just gonna check the baby. Okay, but hurry up. [tense music] Hurry back. [tense music] [footsteps thudding] [foreboding music] [foreboding music continues] [door closes] [Beth] Alright, here we go. Up. [foreboding music] Okay. Mommy will be right back. [window thuds] [ominous music] [ominous music continues] [ominous music continues] What? [ominous music continues] [disquieting music] [disquieting music continues] Oh. Hey, Marion. Hi, Beth. I was just in the neighborhood with another pie, for some reason. Did you hear a loud noise? [Marion] Like what? Like a window closing? I didn't hear anything, except the soft cries of, "More pie, Marion, we need more of your delicious pie." I do love your pie. Of course, hon. You know, if you, uh, want me to watch that delicious baby of yours while you paint or whatever, I'd be happy to. That's really sweet of you, but we're heading into town for a checkup. I forgot some of her insurance paperwork. Oh, okay. I'll leave the pie here. Don't mind me then. [disquieting music] [gentle music] [gentle music continues] [gentle music continues] [upbeat music] -[indistinct chatter] -[glasses clinking] I wanna say during those years I was a chef, I think. -What? -Yeah. -Well-- -You were a- Cook is more like it. Oh, it's still, you were a cook too I was a cook, I was a bartender for a minute, a motorcycle mechanic -for a while. -Oh, motorcycle. -Yes sir. -Oh, that's rich. Hey, it took the good Lord a minute to find me, Danny boy. And I wandered. Ooh, I wandered. Was, um, was pretty rough and tumble sometimes. Well, I'll tell you the craziest thing I think I ever did was, uh, fall from a rope swing into a rushing river. It was spring break medical school second year. And I thought I had broken my neck and my back. [Jim] You okay? I am perfectly fine. I walked away with a couple bruises and the knowledge to look before I swing. And there's nothing wrong with that. -No. -Nothing wrong with being cautious. You got a family to look after. I don't know. [upbeat music] I took TaeKwonDo. -Hey. -I took TaeKwonDo for seven years. I, it was mostly to get in shape. But let me tell you, I walked outta that class with a tremendous... [shouting] [Jim laughing] But listen, I got a story about a dragon I need to tell you. A story about it. -That's right. -I love stories -about dragons. -Yep, I was in China. Anyway, let me tell you about it when I get back. I gotta see a man about a horse. Yeah, see that horse. It's a horse that meets a dragon. You should not trust him. Excuse me. Don't trust him. What, what are you talking about? He took something from my friend. Jim? Is that what he's calling himself now? I, I... That, that is his name, yes. No, it's not. I don't know what his name is, but it's not Jim. He took something from a friend of mine. And whatever you do, you cannot trust him. And for God's sake, don't trust his wife. She is not who you think she is. [ominous music] Hi, there. That was weird. Is it safe in there? Gonna use the head. Okay. [upbeat music] Cliff, couple more. Got it. Thank you, sir. For a preacher, anything. Thank you. [ominous music] [upbeat music] -Hey, there he is. -Ooh. We got another one. -All right. -Good to go. So I saw you're making friends. Yeah, I don't, I, I don't know if I would call it that, -but, uh... -Sure. She seemed like she saw the martial artist in you, buddy. She looked interested. Well, you'd be surprised how often I get that. No, she said that she knew you. Do you know her? As a matter of fact, to be completely honest, I do. Really? Or I did. Yeah, she came around the church a while back after a really-- Well, she'd been through a real traumatic time. [ominous music] Lost her kid. -Oh, man. That's tough. -Yeah. She came to us and she was having trouble processing it. And she was behaving sort of erratically. Yeah, she was telling odd stories, and paranoid. It was so bad for her. Yeah. I mean, honestly, she needs our prayers, right? -Sure. -Cheers. [ominous music] [disquieting music] [disquieting music continues] [ominous music] [ominous music continues] [ominous music continues] [Dan panting] There. Honey, hi. -Dan? -Whoa, -easy. -Yeah. -Hi. -Where, where's your car? The car, oh, where's the car? -Jim, where's the car? -I drove. Oh, he drove. He drove. Where's the music? That's the question, and where's your dancing shoes, -honey. -Danny? -Yeah. -I'm so sorry. [Dan] Oh, yeah. -Danny, boy, be gentle, son. -Let's go. [Dan] I'm fine! Watch yourself, Danny boy. That's just [indistinct]. Why don't we, uh... -I'm so sorry. -What happened to him? [Jim] Oh, we had quite a night. [Dan] Oh, we did. -Yes, we did. -[Beth] Quite a night? -We did, yeah. -Yeah. Your, your boy here got a little loose -is how I'd put it. -Loose. No, I, you're loose. -You're loosey-goosey. -I'm loose, you're loose. Yeah, this guy... Why don't we dial it back a little bit. Lay you down, there he goes. Watch his head, okay. Let's relax. -Just relax. -I'm so sorry. [Beth] Serious. It's good. We didn't drink. We didn't drink, we didn't, we, we had... -Quite a couple. -Three, -four, five? -Yeah. Five? So we, no, it's two drinks twice. -Could have been. -So what? -Okay, Dan, listen. -Wait. Where are you going? There's no horse in the bathroom, and that's where you're going. Dan, hey. -Can you, please- -He owes me a dragon story. -Listen to me. -Yeah. -Listen to me. -I'm listening. [Beth] I found footprints. You found Bigfoot? No. What? No. Are you that drunk? I, no, I'm not drunk. It's something different. Believe me, there is this woman at the bar. She said not to trust him and not to trust his wife. What? Ssh. I, I am whispering. No, you're not whispering. [Dan] It's fine. [tense music] -Listen. -Uh-huh. I sprayed the dirt outside. I found a footprint in the mud in the exact same spot where I saw someone watching me. -Oh, why? -Do you not understand -what I'm saying? -I told you I do. You just, you're so smart. -Ugh. -You're so smart. Honey, this is why I, this is why I love you. This is why [kisses]. -No, I love you. -Stop, Dan! Yeah, look, she took something from someone. That's what I'm trying to tell you. With who? Who? When we...at the bar and I keep trying to tell you. Oh, my God, I am so thirsty. Oh, hurry. [panting] [Beth] Dan! Dan, stop! I'm fine. Do we have any chicken? -What? -I dunno, I just feel really in the mood -for chicken. -Just focus for a second. -Yeah, oh. -Why did you get this wasted? Ah, there is no good reason. [Beth] Well, how many drinks did you drink? Ah, hmm... Three. You had three beers and you're this drunk. Maybe. [disquieting music] [disquieting music continues] Sheriff, it's Marion. [sighs] I hate to do this, but I have to report a child in danger. No, I'm, I'm, I'm positive. Yeah, no, there's, there's drugs involved. Yeah, you need to come to Beth and Dan's house immediately. I'm sure. I'm definitely sure. [tense music] Did you get these beers yourself? Yes, I got the beers. Well, no, actually, Jim got the last one. It was very nice, he didn't have to do that. He got one of those strong ones. And they seem zingy -with the buzz on the tongue. -Zingy? Just buzzy. But I mean, I'm not buzzing. It's just my mouth talking. Does that, Jim, did he just leave? Jim. I'm never getting the dragon story. This is unbelievable. Oh. Oh, honey, I found the chicken. It's behind the baby food. Oh. Oh, yeah. Honey, do you want any of this? [ominous music] Oh, my God. Dan. Dan. [frenetic music] Dan. Dan. Dan, Dan. Look, wake up. Look, listen to me. Anna is gone. Do you hear me? Anna is gone, Jim must have-- Look, I don't know what happened, but Jim must have taken her. Do you hear what I'm saying? I don't need to go to practice anymore. -What? -[Dan mumbling] -[Dan mumbling] -Dan. Oh. [frenetic music] What do I...where did I put my phone? Where's my keys? [frenetic music] [ominous music] Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It was her. It was Marion. Oh, my God, it was Marion. Marion took Anna. My husband and I almost bought that place for when we wanted to escape. Look, Dan, look, I know you can't hear me right now, but, but Marion and Jim have Anna. Just come and find me, okay? [ominous music] [ominous music continues] [ominous music continues] [sirens wailing] I know, girl, it's okay. We'll just keep going, yeah. You're gonna take a nice nap. [Anna crying] A nice nap. Yes, you are, love. [Anna crying] [ominous music] [Anna sobbing] [Anna continues sobbing] [Anna continues sobbing] -[Anna continues sobbing] -[disquieting music] -[Anna continues sobbing] -[disquieting music continues] [Jim groaning] [door opens] I'm just getting started on my hair. The, uh, packing still needs to be done. Did you get the documents? Yeah, yeah, they're on the table right there. Where's the tithing money? Boyd's getting the tithing money. Remember you asked him to do that? Well, why isn't he here? I-i-it's just sitting in a safe in, in church. Why isn't he back yet? [ominous music] [disquieting music] [Beth panting] [disquieting music continues] [disquieting music continues] [Boyd exhales] Do it, Boyd. Don't be weak. Do it for your family. Do it for your family. Marion, are you sure that you want to go this route? [Marion] Don't finish that sentence. Don't even think about finishing that sentence. The strong take what they will. That's nature. That's God's will, you know that. I do, I do, I do. Take responsibility for yourself and no one else. And feel peace. May peace, mercy, and love be multiplied to you. We have been multiplied. [Jim] You're right. Telly, I need you with me, Chavez, around front. Caution, we don't know what his state of mind is. -So be careful. -Yes, sir. [Sheriff] Let's go. [tense music] [door opens] Son. You all right, Boyd? Did you find her? Did you take care of her? [disquieting music] I didn't see her. You didn't wait for her? You told me I had to be here. After you got rid of her. I didn't see her, Marion. Mommy. It's not Marion, it's Mommy. I'm sorry, Mommy. You said I had to hurry here with the money. I did, you're right. It's okay. We're gonna move on. The sheriff will take care of her for us because Papa did his part right. [disquieting music] [disquieting music continues] [disquieting music continues] Wake up. Hey, drug boy. Wake yourself. Sheriff? Yeah. You wanna tell me about this? I don't know what that is. Really? Oxycontin. It's brand name stuff, and it's real expensive. And you've been selling it in my town to my people? -Hmm. -That's not mine. Huh, that's what they always say, huh, Fratelli? What happened to me. You got high, son. I feel sorry for his wife and his baby. Wait, that's it. She was telling me, but I was too. I, I just, I couldn't, I couldn't think. -I couldn't think. -Calm down. But I could hear her. -Yeah. -I could hear her. She was telling me, the woman at the bar. The woman at the bar, she was trying to warn me. -Yeah, the preacher, Jim. -Really? He set me up. That's where this started. Calm down, it's alright. I didn't listen to my wife. Beth told me. She warned me, it's Marion. Marion has the baby. No, you don't understand. Marion has my baby. Marion has the baby. Okay, where's Marion? Marion, do you know where Marion is? -Calm down. -Please tell me. -[Dan] Will you-- -You need to calm down. Tell me you know where Marion is. You need to come down to the station. Does anyone know where Marion is? We need to find her. Right now! We need to find her. [Marion] Boyd. Boyd, you're a good boy. You always were. First time I saw you, beautiful little boy. Saw you with that woman, called herself a mother. She didn't know how to take care of a boy like you. She didn't know how to love you right, raise you right. I knew. And now, we're finally together, a whole family. So let's dye that scrappy head of yours. And let's start over. Boyd, sit still. My name's Tristan. No, your name is Boyd and I'm your mommy. [disquieting music] I already have a mommy. Well, I'm your mommy now. Mommy and Boyd. [disquieting music] [disquieting music continues] [disquieting music continues] Boyd. -Boyd. -Boyd. Dammit. I'll go get him. No, just stay here and finish packing. [tense music] [tense music continues] It's Boyd, I need to speak to the sheriff. No, I need the sheriff now. [tense music] I know you're out here, Boyd. I know you're scared, but you needn't be, it's just me, Mommy. Did you tell on us, Boyd. I know how you break down. I know everything about you. But if that girl comes into my woods, I'm gonna have to kill her myself because you couldn't. I'll gut anyone who gets in my way. [tense music] [tense music continues] Yeah. Boyd's where? Boyd said what? No, no, no, no, no, no. Tell him to get outta there now. No, I don't want anybody getting hurt. I'm on my way. Get in the front, we gotta go now. You guys follow, come on. Let's go. [ominous music] [ominous music continues] [ominous music] Goddammit, Beth. [Beth] What are you doing, Jim? I think you know. You don't have to do this, okay? Look, you don't have to do this for Marion. But you see, you're gonna take her from us if I don't, aren't you? Because she's mine. She is my child. Look, we can do this together, Jim. No, no. You see, you don't know her like I know her. Nobody's gonna be able to stop her. You can't stop her. I can try. We can try together. Goddammit. Dammit. I'm sorry. I gotta do this, Beth. I'm sorry. [Anna crying] I'm sorry. -[fist thudding] -[Jim grunting] -[kick thudding] -[Jim grunting] [Beth panting] -[Anna crying] -[tense music] -[Anna continues crying] -[tense music continues] [tense music continues] [tense music continues] You are a faithless mother. Look, why are you doing this, Marion? My mother was just like you. A weak, distracted, disappointed, trivial artist who cared more about herself than me, her child. It was always about Mommy. I would never do that. I would never leave my child in the hands of another unless I was thinking of giving her away. Look, I'm not listening to you, Marion. You're an evil woman. Maybe I am, but it's an evil world. My mother led me into it, bought me into it, young. Evil ways, the ways of criminals, con artists, degenerates, but I escaped. Yeah, I escaped because I was strong. Too strong. That's why they never let me have a child under the law. But they let you have one. They let you have a baby. That's madness. They don't let criminals adopt, Marion. I was meant to be a mother to a beautiful little girl. And that's what I'll be. Now, before my Daddy left, he taught me how to use a knife and I never forgot. -[Marion grunts] -[tense music] -[Beth grunts] -[tense music continues] [tense music continues] Goodbye, Mama bear. [tense music] [Marion grunting] [Boyd grunting] No. -No, no. -[sirens wailing] No, Boyd. [crying] No. -[crying] No. -[sirens wailing] He's my baby. I hurt my baby. [crying] Beth. -Beth. -[Anna crying] Beth. He's my baby. [crying] Oh, my God. [Anna crying] Oh, my God. [Marion sobbing] I, I didn't mean to. [sobbing] He's my baby. [poignant music continues] How's my baby girl doing back there? All right, co-pilot, what's our ETA? Oh, we're not outta the woods yet. Yeah, we are Dan, and we're staying out. And this time I'm picking out the house. Okay. {\3c&H00C5D2&\fnArabic Typesetting\b1\4c&H000170&\c&H000000&\fs28} {\3c&HAA9600&\4c&H00003E&\c&H000000&}|| Translation-Emperor ||
