Here's Gerrit Witkamp, the national dirt bike champion... ...with his wife Hilde, cheered on by his adoring fans! -Good morning Gerrit, hello Hilde... -Hello! We're told you're actually a dentist, is this true or just a rumor spread by your sponsor? -It's true, I graduated at Utrecht. -But you haven't practiced much lately? You don't lose a skill like that though, shall I demonstrate? This should be good guys, a demonstration by a dentist... ...who's about to become the dirt bike world champion. Do we have a volunteer?

Ah, you ride yourself? Yes, I'm only an amateur, but not for long. -He's won a few times already. -You heard it, the competition is coming... Do you know about this boy? Sure, his name is Rien Hartman. Yes! Is he talented? -Him? Yes, he is. What about me? I'm a biker too! -I wanted to ask you a question... ...I believe that champions can help advance the sport... Look, the sport has to appeal to a wider audience... -Yes... -Yes, talent will emerge eventually... Hey Gerrit, thanks for the interview... Ok guys, it's a wrap. Let's go. Hey baby! -Hey. -You're up early today? -I have to work on my bike. I need some floor cover. -Behind you. -Will I see you tonight? -For sure. My parents are going camping. We've got the place to ourselves. -I'm going to the counter... -Yes, I'm coming. Will that be all? -Some chewing gum. Allright, that will be 24,50. -Here's 25, keep the change, honey. You're so sweet. My my, aren't you clever. -Forgot about those, had you? -They're from home. -With our pricetags on them? -Yes. They're paid for. Hey guys! Watch out now, little Hans. My balls... Here, catch this. ...All of it nicked from my old man... and from Maya, she never notices anything... I need some gas. Shall I put it in there? -Fill her up? -That's what I came here for. -Is there anything else I can help you with? -A receipt, please. Ooh, a receipt... A receipt... Hey fellas! Check this out. Bastard! You bastard! Two peas on a board! Even mine are bigger! Next time, bring your older sister! Dirty faggot! Don't use that one! There's still dirt on it! There's just a little grease on it... Gerrit wouldn't use that either! You should see his mechanic. Gerrit wouldn't use that either! You should see his mechanic. But he could assemble a bike with his eyes closed! -I can do that too. -Yeah, right. -Wanna bet? -Sure -25 bucks, allright? -Ok. Go ahead. 'Swing Divider' 'Float Chamber' Ah, delicious Heineken! That will be 25 bucks. Hey Rien, check out this hot chick! She's a dirty black! -Yeah, but they fuck better, right, love? -Huh? Wanna dance? With you? As if I don't have anything better to do. He's such an asshole. -Would you like something to drink? -Yes. -Chocolate milk? -I'll have a beer. Rien! This chick is easy! -She just can't get enough of it. -Me neither... He's at it again.. -Your skin is very soft... -Don't do that! -Why not? -I don't like that. Jesus... This evening's disco-dance contest is about to start and... Guess you couldn't cut the mustard? Did you get a smelly finger, little Hans? -Here, smell it. Did you get it on? -Why don't you go dancing? -Go dance... Maybe you'll win a album... -Let go of me! Disco, disco... Wow, here's our very own dutch John Travolta! Fantastic! Fantastic. But wait, that's the Black Pearl, the competition! He's this evening's prize winner! Wow! Here is Iggy Pop pop pop pop! -Why don't you sing along? -Jesus saves! Jesus saves! Hey, hands off! Let go of me! I didn't do anything! -Jesus, Truus! -Jesus Christ!

We'll make you look beautiful? -Nice mouth to suck cocks. Thus we can recognize you better, dirty faggot. -I tied his shoelaces together. -I should have fucked him as well. Ok guys, end of the ride, let's go. -I don't want to go home yet... -Already...? Ok guys, I'm out of here. My parents are away, I have the place to myself... Eat her out! Well, he's set for the evening... I wish my parents had a trailer. The church wouldn't allow it. -Can't we come with you? -So you can end up behind the bar? No way. I'll see you tomorrow. They wanted to come inside with us. They have nowhere to go. -They'll have to use the grass somewhere. It tickles your bum... -Shall we lay down? -Upstairs? Not my room, let's take my parents' bed instead. Nice and big. Mind the bedspread! Get off it for a moment. What's that? Read it to me. "Rien, don't let Maya leave too late or her mom will get worried. Dad" -Your dad is so sweet... -My old man, what a guy. Bye girls... -Just look how high... -Not so high! -We're going home, bye! -Quit it! -You'll be fine, okay? -I'm scared, don't be an asshole! -Quit it! Go to the back of the building! Just enter there. -Where? -Back there! Watch it, this is creepy... Over there! Through that window! Lift me up! Come! Give me your hand. Here it is. -Nice. Don't just stand there! Find yourself a room. Little too much to drink, I think? -Never mind. Wait. -What is it? -I'm having my period. -Jesus. -Couldn't you have said that earlier? -It just began! That's just great. I can't get it in. It's totally limp. Damn. My arm is getting tired. It looks just like a shrimp! I had too much booze, do you mind? If they find out, I'll look like an idiot. They don't have to know, let's just pretend. -But what should I do? -Just moan, like in 'Turks Fruit.' -Moan? -Yeah. Like this? More! More! -Eef? -Yo! -Ready? Just removing the spots. -Not bad, huh? -I really nailed her good... -Hurry up. -It was great, wasn't it? -Super. -Did you find a spot last night? -Hey, I'm riding with Eef! -Can't I...? What, on his shitty bike? It won't start again and we'll be left behind. It started right up this morning! Ok guys, let's go! God...damnit! All riders in the 125cc class, come to the start please... What the hell are you waiting for? The race is about to start!! Yeah, chill out will you?! -Will you be careful? -I want to win it. -Well, I'll see you there. -What about me? If you're such a good mechanic, why can't you fix my bike? You know what's your problem? You drink too much, your hands tremble. Fuck off then! Do it yourself! -Dickhead! -Dickhead! Out of the way! Opzij, stommerik. ...coming up is the 125cc... That's number 12, it's Piet... Pieter van der Bresken, Number 8 is Rien Hartman... Very concentrated. There's a lot at stake! We have a late arrival, number 21. That's Hans Blaak. Hurry up boy, or you'll miss the start! Just a few seconds left, ladies and gentlemen... Ready... Nummer acht, dat is Rien Hartman. First out of the gate is number 8, that's Rien Hartman. Way to go Rien! Keep it up Rien, it's going fantastic! Rien! Hurry up! Hurry up! Now in first position is Robbie Meyer... Also a great rider! Now we're in the final stages of the race and it's obvious who is going to win... Number 8, I can see him coming right now and it's Rien Hartman! A wonderful performance, showing real class. Congratulations! You've won! Rien, fantastic! That was awesome, fantastic! -Good job Rien! -You did very well yourself. My bike didn't work. Better luck next time... -Let's go eat something, guys! -Wait a minute, put it on! -Yeah, ok... -Looks nice. Hey guys... Gerrit Witkamp! -Congratulations. -Thanks. -You're not getting too good, are you? -You better watch out! The other leg too. -It's still cold. -I'll heat it up for you. -If it's cold we don't cram it. -Anything else I can do for you? -Yeah, spread 'em! -You can have my "kroket" as well. It's very hot. -Shall I put it in the frying pan? -Ah that's good. I can reveal that Rien Hartman is the champion. I'd say, Japanese sponsors, pay attention! Pay attention to the slender young guy in white. That's number 8, Rien Hartman. Here's your kroket. Warm. -Wow, nice prize. Did you win it? -Don't be funny, -I found it in a ditch somewhere... -Well, the champion gets to choose, it's on the house! -No way, we'll pay for it. -Mind your own business. It happens to be my business. I'll have some fries and a salad. I'll have a kroket. One salad... What about you? I'll have two fried dicks and a bear's cock. You're so funny! What a joker! -Hey, pay up! -Pay for what? We didn't get anything. We're not going to pay for your crap. Hey fellas, don't be jackasses. Just pay up now. Just back off, or we'll do something different... ..like this! Help! Stay back! I'll throw this all over him! Now give me the money, damnit! Pay up, I'm not going to let you screw up what little I have. Let's have it. Go on, give me the money, you son of a bitch. Pay up! -Here you go. -Thanks. ...and here's the man you all came to see. Gerrit Witkamp... -Hey, Witkamp is going to race! -Let's hurry to the track guys! I'll get you. Asshole! That girl has guts, she made them pay. -She a slut. She's worthless. -Jealous? Just a few seconds left before the start of the 500 cc race... ..with our very own Gerrit Witkamp. And here they go! As you can see, Gerrit Witkamp is in the lead...! ...and holds on to it, he's first through the bend! They can't keep up, they just can't! Just fantastic! This puts Witkam at the top of the league, above 'De Havert,' above 'Strauss...' with just one race left in this season, Gerrit Witkamp will be the next world champion. -And? -I won! Everyone... the new Witkamp! -What about you? -I fell... -You fell... -Hans, help me out here. Next time, when I get a new bike.. you just wait and see. Let's rehearse, Ladies and Gentlemen. Beer! Dad... Allright, just one swig and then we start. -Rien, here's to your victory. -Cheers, guys. Cheers! I have to get going, or the front door will be locked. Bye. -Bye. -Leaving already? -He's not allowed to stay out late. -What a dick. -A limp one, as well. -I'll tell you later! -Ok! -Are you going to help me out here? -I'll have a look around... Hey! You have profaned the Lord's day again. -You sounded off your horn in front of the church. -I just wanted to say hello! Just a little joke... Come with me. Come now. Your turn. Had enough? Turn off the lights. -You can't stand here. Get out of here. -Is that so? Why not? You need a license. -What's going on? -Asshole. We don't have a license. We have to leave. But we do have one. It's inside. My brother was mistaken. But, why don't you come inside officer... I'll show you the license and make you a cup of coffee. ...MS8 reporting. Nothing to see here. Hello. You took care of it quickly... well done... Well done... -He'll be back. What, do you think I like doing it? You don't seem to mind. He was a good-looking guy. -Damnit, the tap doesn't work. -I haven't attached it yet. Fucking piece of junk... I'd get out of this mess tomorrow if I could. We're stuck here for the time being. Is that right? Move it, I want to sleep. Sleep tight. -Good night. -Night, little sister. -Jesus, I'm still so sleepy. -Snooze on then... -Look over there. -Hey, it's the guy from the race. -Stop over. -Why? -I want to see if the girl is there. -Do it tonight. We have work to do. Fucking job... Go and get some groceries! Go. -Hey babe! Coming along? -Go wash yourselves first! Hey, calm down will you? Hey, set up your business over here? -What a coincidence. -Want to grab some coffee? Maybe some other time. Where's the local supermarket? -Over there? -See you around. -Hey! I'm coming over for some fries soon! -Sure! -We've met before, right? -I wouldn't know. -You were at the race. -Oh, I don't remember. Sure, when the redheaded guy won. That will be twenty guilders and three cents. -Where does that guy live? -I don't know who you're talking about. -But he was with you, right? -Here you go. For free. -Jaap! -Yes? -Your groceries. -Thanks. Eef! Eef, where the hell are you? -We have a surprise for you... -We found something out. Yeah, me too. The chick from the snack bar showed up. Yeah! They set up business on 'The Brink.' -Have you talked to her yet? -Sure, we had some coffee. She told me she thought I was hot. -Sure... -She likes dark men. Just because she doesn't know me. Wait till she gets a taste of me... Fuck off, You already have a girlfied! -I'd like something else for a change. -I'm nailing her. All of us can't do her at the same time. -Well... -Threesome? Pretty modern. I won't be able to get it up while you're watching. You have to scratch open that little pimple of yours... ...just to take a piss. Watch out, That's dangerous! My little pimple is still a lot bigger than your limp sausage. Is that right? Show me. ...whoever has the biggest one gets to screw the chick. -Are you serious? -Of course. Seems fair, also for her. She'll be riding first class. Close the doors. -Are you for real? -Of course. Get the tape measure. Come on. I'm not doing this by myself. Let's stretch them a little. It's too cold in here. It's not gonna work. -How about I scratch your balls? -That sounds nice. Get off me, freak. -Fifteen. -Give it to me. -Thirteen. -I've never had any complaints. Right. Won by a hair, I guess. -Sorry. -Ladies first... So go ahead! -Well, cheerio... -Cheers. Goes down like the word of God in an elder. -Hello. -Hey, champion. It's you. I didn't recognize you with that silly cap on. -Drink? -I'll have some vieux. He'll be champion sometime. Famous, like Witkamp. -Give it a rest old timer. -And if he doesn't, no problem... He can take over my business anytime. Whatever. Maybe in twenty years time. Like one of those disco bars, you mean. Don't think so. For your trophy collection. A reminder of when we first met, you helped me. It's the brick... I'm glad you like it. It's not even the same brick, the other one was yellow. Is that so? Maybe it's his brother. Cheers. I have to get back to work. I'll see you around. Bye. -Shove off! -Out of the way! I'd like not one, not two... ...but three krokets. And I'll have a large fries with some of the brown goo on it! -And you? -A kroket. -Mustard? -No, it's just fine. -Well, I thought you we're going to hit on her? -Shall I do it? -First my fries. -Double fries with mayonaise! -Your fries. -Now make an effort... Sir... go ahead. Not to disturb you, but I'd like you to fix a kroket... We don't need any comedians around here! -One kroket, I'll pay right away. -Ok. 2.60 Oh, just leave it... -Do you have anything planned for tonight? -Sure. A lot of work. -What will it be, boy? A packet of chewing gum and a meatball. Here you go. -But afterwards, when you get off from work? -Then I'm going to bed. Alone. Your large kroket is of no use to you now, is it? -What's your problem, asshole?! -Watch it! -Tasty kroket. -Come on, you coward! Rien, come over here. There's someone who wants to talk to you... -Hey Guys! Guys! The guy from televison is here, on the track... -He wants you guys for his TV show. -We're going to be on TV! Guys, to the race track! -Where are you going? -To the race track! -So much for our customers. -I'm going to take a look. He's in first place and there's only one Gran Prix left. He doesn't even have to win it, second or third place is enough. Gerrit Witkamp will be world champion soon. The TV station wants to make a big event of it... ...with a parade into town. We want all of you to participate. .and of course we'll need hot chicks too. 'cause hot chicks will do well on TV. -Hey, what do you think you're doing! -You're already sold? -To him. -That's right. That's what I thought. So, everyone is in? -Four million viewers! -We'll be on television! -Ok, we're in! -Yeah we'll do it! We'll discuss the details later, alright? So Mr. Henkhof, how much will you be paying us? -Nothing. You'll get free publicity. -Once more? I said: nothing. It's free publicity for you guys. -Do you belong to this biking club? -She's not a part of it. The boys have expenses, you'll have to compensate them. -Okay, I'll pay for the gas, ok? -And the rest of it... No cash, no motorclub, Is that right guys? -How much did you have in mind? -Five grand. That's too much, half of that is enough. Okay, 2500. Do we take it?? -Do we get it now? -1500 now, the rest after the show. Yes. Here you go. Wow, 1500 guilders guys. Thanks Fien! -Hello! -What do you want? -Business. -What kind of business? -A chance for you to earn something. -Oh? -I've got something for you. -What is it? You do some work for the Japanese guys, don't you? Yeah right, everyone knows you earn a little on the side. You need to get the Japanese to sponsor Rien... -Oh? And why should I do that? -Because he'll be champion, just like Gerrit. He won again yesterday, you were there. So what if I offered him a contract, sweet stuff? -You get ten percent of his earnings. -Can you garantee this? -Hmmmm. Are you his girlfriend? -No, but I will be. -What do you say? -I think... ...we should discuss the details in the car. Maya! Come over here. And? Nice stuff, isn't it? I drive for the factory. Look. -I'm sponsored by the Japanese now. -Far out. Will you be careful? Come on. What could happen. I could break something... -That would be bad enough. -Stop whining! Come on... -Is she coming along...? -Of course Then I'm not. -Why not? -Because. Damnit Maya, both of you are coming along. Maya, I can't get rid of her. She got me the factory contract. Of course. So she could take you away from me. God damnit! At least she's helping me get ahead! All she thinks about is the money, I think about you. She's nothing but a cash register. -Screw you then. -So fuck off with your cash register with a cunt! I've never seen anything this beautiful... Keep it on, let's get the hell out of here. -It's much too expensive. -We can afford it now. -So what are we going to do now? -First, let's grab some chinese food. That's not what I meant. Where are we going from here? Let's go see a movie afterwards... -Bully! Why don't you tell me where we'll go from now on? Your deal with the Japanese was very clever... Business woman. If you're that clever how come you are still working in a snack bar? Never had a lucky break. -You've had one now. -Uh-uh. -Whatever Gerrit has done, I can do too. -What his wifey can do, I can do too. Only better. -I think we're on the right track. -Me too. With the factory backing, I'll go all over the world. -Can I go with you? -Uh-uh. -To Japan? It's beautiful over there... Maya says you screwed the television guy to get me the contract... Is it true? My father used to say: "Life is like a kroket... ...when you know what's in it, you'll lose your appetite for it." My dad was a great guy. ...I love a kroket, and I'll still be eating them. So, I'll see what this baby can do. You're looking at the new champion. Don't fall on your face. -Can we have some oranges? -Buy some, Wim. We're on holiday. -How much are they? -For free. Special offer. Thanks! -Who wants another orange? -Me, me! -Give it to me! -Be quiet now, children. Rien! -What's the matter? -I'm okay. You scared the shit out of me. What's wrong? His dad is devastated. He's crying all day. -Fien, help me! -I've never seen my dad do that. Sucks for Rien, doesn't it? Once he's allowed visitors, will you come along? I can't stand hospitals, they freak me out. -What about you? -I think you should go first, he'd like it. -Okay, whatever... -She's great, isn't she. -She's coping well. -Do you think they will be staying here for a while? -I think so. It's a good enough spot. -Hans, are you coming? Can I come along? There's nothing to do around here. -Here you go, dad. -Thanks. -Maybe I can get with her now? -Don't even think about it. I have a better chance. -She likes blondes... -Are you nuts...? She likes cash. -Don't talk crap. -It's not crap! How do you think she and Rien got together? The money. Are you coming? -How is he doing? -It has not really sunk in yet. -Are you married to him? -No. -Living together? -We were going to be... I'd consider if that will be enough to last through this. Pity won't help you, especially in the beginning. It will fade. And it will only make things worse in the end. -Here's a cup of tea. How are you doing? I'm rolling. -I'm playing handball... -Oh, really? They got me playing as a goalpost. Last week I almost scored a goal, but someone threw nails from the stand... and punctured both my tires. -Is being here helping you? -Revalidation. I'm learning to piss again. You have to punch yourself in the stomach... ...for it to come out. You have to check the clock to see if your shitting pills stopped working. What a lovely conversation. I don't want to see you again. Keep the fur coat. At least it will have been good for something. Take a walk if you feel like it. It's pretty around here... ...Much prettier than Japan. -And? -Let's go. -I guess Rien is out of the picture. -He needs a nurse, I won't be one. -You sure got over him quickly. -What's love anyway? Hand over the money. -Hello Rien. Hello. -Hello. It's great to see you! Take it easy mom, you're overreacting. -You can get right in, you see? -We had it adapted. Can you manage? At ease. Dear Rien, what happened to you can't be undone. We all know that. ...So we all chipped in and bought you a little something. Here you go, it's yours. It's motorized. -Well, why don't I give it a spin. -Sure, let's go. We'll expect you to come visit us as often as we come to see you. That's the start button. Fantastic. I might just be champion in this thing one day. Come. -You've completely rebuilt it. -It will easier for you to go inside. -It was supposed to be ready at twelve o'clock? -Yeah, yeah. -Do I have to wait for that as well? -Yes. So What? I'll be right back. -I came to get some gas. -No problem. -Fill her up. -The car? -You've been busy lately. -Yeah. I want to talk to you sometime. -Sure, when? -How about now? -How about now? -Let's take a ride. -Hey! Come back tomorrow! -Are you mental? -Where are we going? -Somewhere quiet. Okay? -I've got a nice bed back in the trailer... -What do you mean? Jesus. Dead end. -Watch it, prick! It's slipping! -Fuckin' brakes! -Jesus! I thought you could drive?! -Jesus! -Fucking car! -Calm down, damnit! There's my father! Use the horn! Hey dad, over here! -Got a towing cable? -It's in the back. -What do you smell? -It's nice... -...I don't smell any fries here. -No, just ditches and cow shit. ...I'm getting out of here. I'm off to Canada. -What's over there? -Adventure...it's not for everyone. Man, you'll need at least ten grand to even get there and to get settled. I'll get it... I'm nearly there. -I've seen that woman in the pub. -It's Fien, from the snack bar. She's no good. -What's your problem, fucking hick farmer?! -Cool it, he's my father! She paints her face, like the whores of Babylon. -So I'm a whore, god damnit? -He's not talking about you. -The old guy is a jerk. -That's why I'm getting out of here. -Are you coming along to Canada? -Man, your penniless. -Where did you get it? -There's more where that came from. -How are you doing? -Okay. That hits the spot! -How's Eef doing? -I barely see him. He's always off to somewhere. That's nice! I'm sorry I didn't come to see you... -I don't like hospitals much. -Me neither. I'll show you something. Come with me. ...Not a scratch. Those gooks were glad to get rid of me. They didn't even want them back. -That's decent of them. -You can have them. They're yours. -You're kidding? -It's allright. I talked it over with my dad. How am I going to pay for them? I'm broke. I told you, they're yours. We are buddies right? You better become the champion in my place though. -What do you want? -Just looking. -That's free. Are you practicing? -I got a new bike. Dog food? But you don't have a dog. Hey... you don't put stuff like this in a kroket, do you? If it's good enough for Barry Hulshof's dog, it's good enough for my customers. My aunt's been eating it for ten years, ever since my uncle lost his job. Nope, she lives in America, in California. She's very healthy. ...for a shiny coat and a wet nose... -Eef! Eef ate four of them. Four! You had one too. What about food inspectors? If the cops find out... Hans? My car won't start... Hey... I guess I earned a little something... Hmm. Come inside with me... Delicious kroket, huh? It's good for your nose! Well well, little Hans... -Got some practice in, kiddo? -Hey, Eef... -Beers for the both of you? -Sure. Fine -That's one powerful bike! -Think you can handle it? -If Gerrit can do it, so can I. -Yeah, but he was always the number one. Just wait and see, I'll do the same. if you become my mechanic, like you were for Rien. I can think of better ways to spend my time. I'll make better money too. Check this out... Two one-way plane tickets to Canada, they're valid for six months. -Two...? -Yeah, in case I want to bring someone. -Like who? -Not you. -This is part of the deal. -Hmmm... -And? -Not bad... Okay, I'm out of here. Wait, stay here. I'm leaving anyway... I work for a contractor, making some money on the side. I'll see you around. Bye. -How about a beer, Hans? -Yes. Is something going on between you and Eef? Tell me... -Here, do you smell anything? -Just hair. -No, it's the smell of fries and frying oil. And this? More grease, a mix of oil and horse lard. I smell of frying oil all over, I want to get rid of the fucking smell! By going to Canada, with Eef? That's where your Aunt is eating Dog Food? -That's California... -Same thing. It's the same crap everywhere. Why not stay with me? Why would I? -Because I'm going to be champion. -Do you think so? Sure... I'm training with Witkamp. -Why don't you take it off? -What about you? -Okay? -Let's try this... Well, here we go, I guess... It's my brothers body building magazine... A cock with a sense of direction... -Faster? -If you like. Look into my eyes as you come? -I'm first. -Uh-uh. -I'm getting a beer. -Nice and cold. -Yes...Just like me. Oh? I guess we'll just have to do it again. -Again? Already? -Yes. What are you looking at, stupid cunt? ...the Bible tells us to knock and the door will open... ...so knock on the door. Now! For Jesus is the door... ...Jesus will open to you! Halleluja! halleluja! halleluja! For we all know, Jesus is the son of God! ...halleluja! Halleluja! Praise the Lord! Let us be glad, the Bible tells us of Jesus of Nazareth... ...but the bible also tells us about God. Who is God? An asshole! An asshole who dealt me a shitty hand! Disease is the devil! What is the devil? Who? The doctor, the doctor who let me live. The devil makes disease. God is the healer! What are his office opening hours? Just laugh people, laugh all you want... God's office is open anytime, son... ...and I'm certain he will give you two listening ears... It will be in stereo! You keep that brave face boy... ...but if it becomes too much to bear, remember that office. I can set up an appointment. Just stop by anytime. Brothers and sisters, we are going! -Rien! Wait a moment! -Just fuck off Maya, -Rien! -There's no Rien anymore! Watch out! Damn! No, I'm fine, just fine. -Would you like some ice cream? -That's okay, give me an ice cream. -You're really into religion? -Uh-uh. -That happened very suddenly. -Not at all. God was always in me... In you? What a dirty bastard. One of the people with us is the son of a nerve surgeon. Why don't you give him a try? He's a Jew, but he's very skilled. Negroes, Chinese, a Frisian. All of them have been tampering with me. The only thing running about me is my nose. What about God? God? -Yes, god! Fetch! -He likes you. -I'm always nice to animals.. -And to people? -Sometimes... Thanks. -Real gold? -Hmm hmm. -Only gold is good enough. -I'd be careful with that stuff. Oh, I'm not worried. I may be old but... Thankfully I've never had to use it. But whoever gets hit with this... And what if I were to use it like this... ...would you like it? Well? Five hundred bucks, or I'll tell your wife you're a faggot. -I don't have any money on me. -So go get some, dirty bastard. And don't call the cops, or I tell your wife everything. The dog stays here! Come! Hurry up! -Are you in a hurry? -I'll be right back. Here you go. Get him! Yeah! I'll get you, damnit! Pants off. Spread the legs! Hold still. Shut the fuck up or I'll piss in your face! Yes, come on. You. Wider, Wider! Hurry up, hurry up, man. -Come on, next one. -Change! -Jesus, what a wet mess... -Hurry up! Ok boys, countdown. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0! Yes, move it boys! So, Eef. -Why did you get me? -Because we felt like it -Because I'm robbing gays? -Not at all. We saw you doing your thing and we thought: what a hunk. Let's get that one. -Don't touch me! -Down boy... You liked it quite a bit. -I'm no dirty fag. -But what do you know, Eef... -What did you want with my sister, anyway? -Nothing. Keep it that way. I don't give a shit that you're a thief... ...but my sister is too good for a queer. -I'm not a queer! -Come on kid, just admit it... Why the fuck would you even care about something you are. Hmm? Just be honest with yourself. Hi, We're getting started. Break the shocks with your thighs, don't stick to your saddle. I know. I've raced before today! Hey, Hey, wait for me! Come on, Hans. One more time. -Are you hurt? -Get off the track! I thought you wanted to train? Come on wimp! We're not there yet. Go on,get up! Go play somewhere! Amateur! -How did it go? -Fantastic, this will be a hoot. -Have you got enough? -Plenty, we can only take the joke so far. -What a great idea! -Here, take a look at it. I'm going to contrast it with you. That kid is a real clown! Add a funny tune and it'll go down really well. Jesus, just look at it. The kid is hopeless! He'll probably win a prize sometime... Fien! Gerrit is awesome! Will take me some time to catch up... ...but that bike is great. -My sister. -Then I'm out of here... -Hello Eef! -Hi. I thought about it a bit more and I'd like to come to Canada with you. Making big money sounds good to me. Why don't you tell her. It's about time you opened your own trap. What's with him? We nailed the guy in Rotterdam... He liked it. Jesus! It's about time we left here. This could only happen to me, three strikes, three misses. -Father? -Yes? -I'm a fairy. -What do you mean, boy. -I'm queer. -Hmmm. -A faggot! -What's that then? It's in the bible. Leviticus 20:13. 'If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman...' ...both of them have committed an abomination.' -You are the lowest of the low. -Hitting me won't hurt me. God punishes you through my hand... I will keep praying for you afterwards. You can pray until the paint falls from the walls, I am what I am. Brother and sisters! This was a fine and strong song... ...in which we gave praise to the Lord. Halleljah! -Halleluja! -Halleluja! Praise the Lord! Oh Lord, aid us in our time of need... Brothers and sisters, whoever wants something from the Lord... ...let him come to me. Come all, have joy in your hearts.. ...and come to me. Hallelujah! No, Maya, stay in your seat! Don't act like an idiot! -Dear sister... -Oh brother.. I have such pain, here... People, dear people... Let us all pray for God... ...to redeem this woman. He will do this, if we ask it. Oh Lord. We know that you can cure this woman of her pain. We know your strength, your power. Oh brother, I feel relief! God damnit Maya, god damn... Please. Will you help us? God's office is always open, son. Oh Lord ...we do not know your purpose. We face a dark mirror... ...and because of this we pray to you Lord. Because we understand this boy's desire to walk. Give him the courage. Give him the strength. Give him Lord, what he yearns for. Let him walk, oh Lord. Give him strength, we beg you! Nothing... Nothing, just like all the rest. -It was the first time... -And the last. Maya, take me. Here? -Do you want it here? -Where else? At your place, on the couch? Beneath the shaded lamp? Are you scared?! Or are you afraid God won't help me? As hard as freshly made spaghetti. Nothing, god damnit. Nothing! -I don't mind! But I do! I want it so bad. Here is what I want! Inside my head! Not so terrible, huh? When it's in your head... ...and nowhere else? What am I going to do?! What am I going to do?! Ladies and gentlemen, it's about to be decided. The riders are getting ready and Gerrit is on the far right.. ...off they go! Fantastic! Gerrit is leading straight away. -Here you go. -Thanks. -French fries for whom? -That's for me... -Can't you see me anymore? -You're standing there, aren't you? -Why aren't you in town? I didn't like the place anymore. -And the same goes for me? -That's right. Come on boy, what have you got to offer? No money, no future, come on. ...I can see them coming, at the front... Gerrit is in the lead... -I do have something to offer. -Really? Like what? I don't know. All I know is that I think you're an amazing girl. Come back when you have something to offer. Everyone! Food and drinks are free! ...Witkamp,Witkamp, Witkamp, Witkamp... ...to become the champion... -Why don't you shut up, idiot? -Shithead! Idiot! Gerrit my boy, I think you are one of the greats! -Hey everyone, it's 'Studio Sport!' -Beer, guys! Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We have a world champion... Beer! Beer, beer! -Where's Rien? -He wanted to get out for a bit. -Out of the way! -Gerrit! Come on guys, give the man some space, he has to stand in front. But before we show you, we here at Studio Sport... -Don't fuck around with that television! -Attention! -Look, it's me! See? -Quiet! And what do we know for sure? Gerrit IS world champion! -Witkamp, Witkamp, Witkamp! ...look, it's a telegram... from the Queen. -You're joking? -No, just look. -Damn, it's real... -Yes... ...boys, long live the Queen! Now drink! Hey, don't touch that! You look like an idiot now anyway. I said don't touch, or we'll redecorate this place! Are you totally fucked in the head? Don't touch him! Okay, we're going to redecorate around here! Let go! Goddamn! Cafe 'The Harmonie!' Police, police! Ooh Gerrie Gerrie! Need a dentist? -Police! Police! -Time to split! -Let's go guys! -Let's get the hell out of here! Dad! Nice of you to stop by... -Come to me... The Hartman boy has killed himself. Will you tell the father? Jos, something terrible has happened... Rien is dead. Give me a hand. -What a mess.. -Yes. -Rien's dad had a breakdown. -Of course... The pub will be sold. -Really? -Do you have money? -No. Sure you do... What if you sell the factory bikes? Shall we take a look inside? -I might have a nice little job for you. -Well, well... We can really make something out of this... Sure, just make a few changes here and there. Hey... how about we break through that wall and turn it into a snack bar? And this is a good space for dancing, during the weekends. -I think we'll be okay... -I do too. -Hey little Hans... -Little Fien... hey... -Sugar? -Yes please. Another one. Thanks. -You? -No thanks... -I'll look pregnant. -He's too fat. Wait a moment... Be right back. Coming along for the ride? To where? Wherever we want to go. What about it? I'll beat him some day...
