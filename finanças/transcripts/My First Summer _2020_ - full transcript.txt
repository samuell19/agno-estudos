I felt like I'd been under there my entire life. Wrapped in yellow blankets, like a baby, swaddled too tight. I was sinking further and further and just when I was about to run out of breath, something pulled me out. Something in the trees. A light. A glow. Is someone hungry? Huh? - Hello? - Tilly... - Hey Hello, come here. Hello. What's your name? Tilly, Tilly. Where are you off to? Hey... It's okay. Your dog's really cute. - Don't take her. - I just wanted to make sure you're okay. Are you okay? - How did you know I was here? - Well, I was there last night at the reservoir. I saw what happened. I won't tell anyone. I pinky promise. What are you doing with your finger? - Haven't you heard of a pinky promise? Well, it means more than a normal handshake. So, what's your name? - Claudia. - I'm Grace. - What colour are the other fingers? If this one is pink, what colour are the others? - It's not that it's pink. It's just called your pinky finger. And the other ones all have different names. You know them, right? - First, second, third- - Mm mm, mm mm. Pinky, ring. Rude. - What makes it rude? - No. - What? - Just, don't do that. It's like saying something really mean, but with your finger. Do you wanna come and sit with me? Can I come and visit you sometime? - No one can know I'm here. If they find out, they'll take me away. - I won't tell anyone. It can be our secret. - Purple promise? - Purple promise. It was her, Grace. The glow on the bank. The pull from the trees. She's not of this place. - Do you want me to have a nervous breakdown Grace, is that it? - No Mom. - Why the fuck are the cops here? - I don't know. - What the hell you been up to, young lady? - I've not done a fucking thing. Hey, hey listen, hey. Don't talk to her like that. We just need to ask her a few more questions. Okay, so I'm Detective Croydon. This is my partner, Detective Jones. We just wanted to clarify what you saw at the res last night. - So you saw some thrashing in the water and then you said you saw a girl running away from the res. And we are not sure who that is. - See, the deceased didn't have any kids or family. So we think that it might have been a visitor, or someone from out of town, Now, is there anything you can tell us about- - Look. - We really need you to think, okay? - It's a scorpion in a lollipop. What'd she look like? light hair, dark hair. - Yeah look, I don't really think I saw a girl. - No girl? - No, it was dark. And I was on my own and I think I got freaked. And saw things that weren't actually there. I've got a really overactive imagination. Mom says it all the time. - So wait, let me get this straight. There was no girl - But you did say- - Yeah, I know. I know. I'm saying that I think I got carried away when I was speaking to the officer last night. There was no girl. But I definitely saw a woman, an older lady walking into the water and then the thrashing. - Right... So you saw an older woman walking into the water - Yeah, that author lady who lives by the res. I recognised her from the back of one of her books. - Veronica Fox. - Yeah. That's her. She just walked into the water and didn't come out. It was fucked. - Well, sounds about right. - Cool. So... I'm good? I'm not in trouble? - No. You're not in trouble. Like I said, we just wanted to clarify a few things. - Cool. - You've been a big help. Thank you, Grace. - Hey, what you saw must've be really scary. You got someone to talk to about it if you need to? - Yeah. Lessons my darling. My darling girl, what's wrong? - I don't know. - Oh my sweet. You having bad thoughts again? Oh my darling. It's okay. It's okay my darling, it's okay. Shh, shh, shh. Sweetheart Breathing in... and out. Sweet love, you're doing so well. Just breathe in. Stay with me my darling, it's all okay. Shh, shh, shh. Sweet love, it's okay. It's okay, stay with me. Stay with me. Shh, shh, shh. My darling, it's okay. Slow it down, shh, shh, shh. It's okay. We're nearly there, my darling. We are nearly there. Breathe in. - And out. Breathe in... and out. Good. Breathe in... and out. - Where... - What? - Where did my mom go? What did I do to her? Nothing, hey Claudia, it's me. It's me, Grace. Hey. Remember? No, no, no, please. Claudia please. Come back. Wait. Claudia. Claudia! Claudia! Claudia! Claudia! Claudia! Claudia! Hey. Claudia. - I should be with her. I should be with her. - You can't be seen here. You don't want to be found do you? Hey, let's go home. Yeah? Let me take you home where it's safe. Oh, you have to look in the mirror. - Why? - Just do it. Can I do you? - I've got too much hair, it won't work. - Get in. - You like it here? - In the tub? - No, I mean, in this house. - I guess. Why don't you ever leave? - I've left before. - I don't think the res counts. - It's on the outside. - Yeah, but I mean like the real outside. - Mom said there's nothing but pain there. - She said that? - She came from there. She said that it was filled with selfish people who didn't treat each other very well. - So you've really never been past the res? - Why would I? - I don't know, to go to school, see a doctor, go to your grandparents' houses and have cups of tea and listen to the same story 10 times over. I mean, I can't believe it. - Why are you laughing? So no one knows you exist? - You do. You can look in the mirror now. - Hmm, you're quite good at this. - Yeah. - I've never read any of your mom's books. I hear they're really depressing. - Mom said I'm not allowed to read them until I turn 18. - How old are you now? - 16. - Same. Lord, how unutterably disgusting life is. What dirty tricks it plays on us. Here we are among the breadcrumbs and the stained napkins again. The knife is already con... - Congealing. - Congealing with grease. Disorder, sor... - Sordidity. Sordidity and corruption surrounds us. Call the waiter, pay the bill, we must pull ourselves up out of our chairs. We must find our coats. We must go. - Must, must, must... detestable word. - I who had thought myself immune find that the wave has tumbled me over head over heels, leaving me to summon my forces, rise and confront the enemy. Why was that page marked? - Mom was showing it to me in class. - Wow. - What? - I thought my mom was fucked. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. - Mom just felt everybody's pain. But she's free now. What's your mom like? - Mmm, she kinda sucks. - Why? - She just, she has a lot of problems and her boyfriend's a dick. It's quite nice being away from it all actually. I like spending time with you here. ♪ As late as the hour may be ♪ ♪ Gimme your love ♪ ♪ I need your love so bad ♪ ♪ Gimme your love ♪ ♪ I need your love so bad ♪ - Purple, rude, ring, pinkie. - It's a bit late. Have a seat. Want a beer? There you go, it's all right. It's okay. So where you been? What like a boyfriend? Look at you, my little girl's all grown up. - I'm not your little girl, Mike. - Okay. So do you have a boyfriend? It's okay if you do. I mean are you using protection, are you- - Oh stop. Yeah, goodnight Mike. - I'm just playing. - Goodnight. I got whatever I could before Mom woke up. There's a lot. There's lollies and chewy. These are really good. Oh and lollies with bugs in them. - Wait, what's that? Strawberry milk. Do you want some? - Strawberry milk? - It's really good. You'll like it. Purple promise. Okay no, don't choke, don't choke. All right, hang on. Guess what else I brought? My mother said the fences were the walls of her womb. Said she could only protect me if I stayed inside, away from everyone, from everything. - I made these. These ones are my favourite. Brave. Badass. I'm gonna sell them at the market or something. They're my ticket outta here. - Where do you want to go? Somewhere. Anywhere. Do you like them? They're very... colourful. - Okay. Tell me one thing that you like about yourself. Okay... I'll tell you. - You hardly know me. - I know enough. Smart? Aren't you? What else? Am I pretty? Now choose your favourite colour from here. - I think I like this one. - Turquoise. - Turquoise. Yeah. I like turquoise. - Okay, what you do, thread, hold it. You're a natural. You'll have to help me. Come on! It's 200,000 degrees. Come on. What's wrong? The best way to overcome a fear is to confront it. I'm serious. - Right. - I heard it on the TV and everything. Come on. Come on. Hey, hey. - You can't tell me that didn't feel good? - How deep is it? - It's not deep. See? You're okay. Come on, I'll help you through it. - Okay. - You ready? - Don't. Okay. Three, two. - Claudia, Claudia, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey. Okay breathe in, breathe in. And out. Breathe with me. Hey, breathe with me. In, out. Breathe in, out. Hey. Hey. Keep looking at me. Okay? - Okay. Okay. Okay. - It's okay. Three, two, one. Go ah. I'm so bad at this. Did you see that?! Oh, lucky charm. You can have it. - Can I still eat it? - Feel lucky? - Yeah. I don't really know how I'm supposed to be feeling. You make me think that all the stuff my mom taught me in class, about the world being cruel, about people being monsters, is all a lie. - How do you know I'm not a monster? - Do you think you are? - Not many people like me, though. - Because monsters only like other monsters. Welcome. I've got that poem here somewhere. Okay. 'When Day is Over' by Lesbia Harford. When day is over I climb up the stair, take off my dark dress, pull down my hair, open my window and look at the stars. Then my heart breaks through these prison bars of space and darkness and finds what is true Up past the stars where I'm one with you. - I like that image of a heart breaking through prison bars. Can I feel it? - Feel what? - Your heart. - Can you hear it? - Yeah. - Is it okay? - Yeah. - It should be broken, shouldn't it? - Shock can make you numb and... - I don't feel numb. I feel more alive than I've ever felt. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that. - Your mom would have wanted you to be happy. - Maybe you should go. What? - I need you to go. I need you to go. - Claudia- - I said go. Go! Get out! My mother said there would come a time when we would have to leave. We talked about it for months. About how we would be light again, without pain. But when the time came, I couldn't do it. I left her sinking further and further and further.

I'll give the place a bit of a once over. - Okay. Come on, come on. - "Diving into concrete". - Good girl. What's that? Signed copy of one of her books. Who's it addressed to? - Why? - 'Cause why would she keep a signed copy of her own book? - My darling, Claudia. I love you more than anything. You are my world. - Who's Claudia? That could be a lead. - So it's a murder investigation now? - We don't know! - Where are you headed? - I'm just going for a ride. Tilly?

Nah, we're always finding her in weird places. - I've never seen a dog up at your place. - Well she's an inside dog... and she's shy. Tilly, hey, hey. - Well she looks happy to see you.
