Hey, what's up? How you doing'? Hey, could you pick me up, please? Like, now? How was the movie? I'm sorry, okay? Yeah, get in. Hey. You know, when I was your age, I barfed all over Grandma's favorite shag carpet in the guest bathroom. I told her it was bad shellfish. But actually, I downed half a bottle of peppermint schnapps behind Sweetie Pie's with my friends. So, come on. No judgment. Just tell me what happened tonight. Zach and I broke up. Oh, my God. Sweetie, I'm so sorry. No, don't... Don't... Don't do any of that. It's just... He started talking about Japan and how it's too far, and that I shouldn't do the program next year. That's not cool. What? Like, Mom, you just have no idea what I'm going through, ever. - Maybe he's right. - Actually... Maybe I shouldn't go. It's not like I speak the language. I don't know anyone else who's going. Why am I even going? Listen, when I was in high school... No, Mom, this isn't the Sweetie Pie's, okay? Things are, like, a lot more stressful now. Yeah, you'd be surprised. Why don't you sit down, and I'll tell you a story. Because I'm gonna go to bed. I'm tired. Aw. Well, you're probably just gonna stare at your phone all night. So, then why can't you just text me? Sit your butt down! It was the early '80s... No, please, not the '80s. Yes, the '80s in the San Fernando Valley. And me and my friends... Were valley girls. I know, you've told me a thousand times. You guys were all like, "Oh, my God. Like, where's my brain?" Yup. And we actually used words like "tripendicular," and we wore teal eyeliner and popped collars. And we hung out at the mall every night. Wow. Deep. Okay, so we weren't exactly solving world hunger.

And, everybody, remember, no more spiking the punch. Okay? Last year, I got a DUI. Mickey, I'm not... Mickey, I'm not supposed to come in here. Okay. Mickey, we could get in trouble. We're gonna get in trouble together. - We can't... - Hey, it's just us. Okay? Now! What do you say, Jules? Me, you? That? Just say yes. Just say yes. - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah. - Yeah! Excellent! ♪ Janet Jackson Janet Jackson ♪ ♪ Just like Janet Just like Janet ♪ Hmm. I, like, totally have to practice if we're gonna be live on KROQ. KROQ is a radio station, Loryn. I need UVs, like, now. - Tell me. - What happened? I just got asked to prom by five assholes. I just can't decide who I want to take me, Mike or Danny. Danny has the bod, but his brains are bad news. I mean, he's going to Cal State Northridge. Like, we're going to Northridge? Yeah, but we're not gonna actually date the guys who go there. But, I mean, you don't have to worry. You're set for life with Mickey. Oh, my God, you guys are so getting married. - Totally. - I'm so sure. I mean, people are waiting now, you know? Some girls don't even get married until they're, like, 23 and stuff. If I'm not married by 23, I'll kill myself. But I'm not even sure what I wanna do with my life. Yeah, that's why you get married. So you don't have to do anything. Yeah, like, once the divorce is final, my mom has to, like, get a job. Well, what does she like to do? Be married. Don't bring up your mom's divorce, Stacey, it makes me really sad. Sorry. Does anyone want a Diet Coke? - Okay. - One for me. - No ice, Stacey. - Okay. But what if you got a bitchin' job? You know, like designing clothes? Or, Loryn, dancing? Why would you want to? To have a life. To, like, be independent. Ew! Bummer! But it's the 1980s, guys.

Well, if you'll let me finish... Because you were afraid of his tattoos? Ugh. You know, I'm so tired. Maybe you should just go text all your friends. No. I mean, you can keep going. If you talk more about him and not about, like, leg warmers. Okay. No leg warmers. I promise. Now, take it forward, take it, one, two, three... - Mom? - Huh? Have you ever, like, thought something was totally right that it should, like, fit just perfectly but then it just totally doesn't? Ooh, well... I guess, that kind of depends on what you're trying to fit where, you know. I mean, sometimes, things aren't meant to... - be put in certain... - Oh, my, God! Experimenting is fun. - Ew! Mom! - It's exciting. - Hello, ladies. - Oh, my God! Look at what I got. What is that? Look at this new technology. - Look at how sleek it is. - Whoa! There's a whole VCR in here.

And I was, like, ribbin' him hard sayin' he wouldn't take that thing over 90 and he was, like, "I'm so sure." So, I'm, like, "Okay, prove it, dude." So, we take this thing out to the street. He gets it to, like, 50, wimps out. So, he starts doing donuts and then he throws up. And then I was, like, "There's no way you're getting that puke out of the glove box." - You're not even listening. - What? - Are you listening to me? - Yeah. Uh... You puked in his glove box?

Not punk music. - So, why don't you tell me? - Oh. Okay, well, for starters, punk is dead. Well, I'm sure the dead band is gonna be totally bitchin', but I have curfew. But you're gonna miss your one-week anniversary. I mean, that's a big record for this guy. - Hey, shut up. - Ow! Well, we can celebrate another time, but I have to get home.

Sweetheart, come in here and tell us about it. Okay. - So? - Hey, ya. - Hi. - So what did you guys see? Return of the Jedi. Ooh. Is Darth Vader Luke's father? Tell me. Tell me. No, don't tell me. Don't tell me. Okay, tell me. - Yeah, he's... - No, don't tell me! - Okay, tell me. - Yeah, he's the dad. Wait. Who's whose dad? Well, the Jedi. Are you lying to us? I can tell you're lying 'cause your mouth is open. Close your mouth. We try to be so chill and you're lying to us? Our... Our plans changed and I didn't have a dime, and it's not like I have some kind of satellite phone device I can keep in my pocket and just transmit to outer space and call you guys whenever I want to. You're grounded, young lady. Thank you for turning me into a typical mother. I'd like you to go wash your face and go to bed. Wash it. Is that how you ground a child? I don't even know. I think you did it the best you could have done it. What are you doing here? I figured we could be grounded together. Shh. I'm sorry. Oh. Nice top hat. I may have gone through a brief magician stage in fifth grade. Yeah, that's the day that Karen got her car. Nice. Oh, yeah, that's just, like, a thing that Stacey and I do. I've been making clothes since I was, like, seven. So, what's this guy's story? - Well, this is Shaun. - Shaun? I named him after Shaun Cassidy, who was, like, my first true love. Here, I'll show you. See, I was, like, kind of obsessed. - Oh, wow. Hot. - Shut up! Wow. It's like... It's like art. The way you put clothes together. I just think it's, like, why be boring? You know? Yeah. My guidance counselor told me there's this college, Fashion Institute of Technology. Yeah, where is it? - New York City. - Ooh! Yeah. - But I mean, I don't know. - Well, let's do it. Let's go. I mean, some day. But, like, I have to finish senior year and... Oh, my God, did I tell you that, like, KROQ is throwing our prom? No, no, no. I know what you're thinking. But it's gonna be awesome. - Is it? - No. It is. I promise. Especially if I have the right date. What, you mean, like, Shaun Cassidy over here?

No. But you know what would be rad? If you, like, hung out in the valley a little bit more? Do you really want me to? No, come on, my friends, they're not, like, contagious. - I did some research. - Research? About New York. The scene there is exploding. The East Village. We could rent a railroad flat on Avenue A. We'd be so broke, we'd have to eat Chef Boyardee 24/7. And you'd be in fashion school. Mmm-hmm. I'd write you songs and play them for you on stage at CBGB. 8I don't know. I mean, I... No, I'm supposed to, like, go to Northridge in the fall and, you know, my parents would, like... I mean, what do yours think? Look, I don't have that. It's just me and you. That's all I want. ♪ I'll stop the world ♪ ♪ And melt with you ♪ ♪ You've seen the changes ♪ ♪ It's getting better All the time ♪ ♪ There's nothing You and I won't do ♪ ♪ I'll stop the world And melt with you ♪ Hey, you okay? Did I tell you guys that Randy's writing me a song? Oh, he's in a band? I didn't know that. Let me guess, a punk band. Technically speaking, punk is dead. You know, uh, honey... I was thinking that, uh... I, uh... I'm not so sure that he's the guy for you. You know? You know, Dad, you don't even know him. Well, I think that he's too old for ya. And I think he drives too fast and I think he does too many drugs. Which is any amount of drugs, in my book. And also, I... He's never once come to the front door to pick you up. He's never knocked on the door, and introduced himself... Yeah, who doesn't introduce themselves? - Like Mickey used to do? - Yes. - Sure, like Mickey. - Yes. Like Mickey. By the way, Barry said that Mickey is torn up without you. Torn up. Well, that doesn't surprise me at all. Wait, you talked to his dad? Honey, it was an investment thing, okay? Oh, my God. By the way, we're not investing in, uh, Macintosh. We're gonna go with Commodore. You're the boss. Point is, honey, Mickey, he's got a future. Mickey is the kind of person who will take care of you. He's reliable. He's going places. - He'll take care of your kids. - And he can take care of you. Oh, my God. What are you guys even talking about? I mean, honey, you know, next year, you're gonna be at Northridge and you're gonna have to make a lot of big decisions. And your mom and I wanna help prepare you. I might not even go to Northridge. There's some really rad fashion stuff happening in New York. New York City? Yeah, and Randy said that... Honey, you're not moving across the country with a guy we've never met. Dad. It's not... Especially not to New York City, okay? No. That's the crime capital of the world. Okay, the crime statistics... So, basically, it's a giant... - Oh, it's a murder capital. - ...jail! You walk down the street and it's just stabbings. - Stabbing! - Whoa, whoa, guys. Okay. What if I just invite him over? For dinner? That way, you guys could get to know him. Could we start there? What? I mean, I know I haven't seen you in a while, but pretty sure the guy I remember didn't dress like Kenny Loggins and go hang out with a bunch of old yuppies. Gimme a break. Like you haven't done some warped stuff for chicks. Remember Mad Dog Marie? Oh, yes, who went off to Marie-hab. Yeah, I mean, this is, sort of, the first phase of our plan. She wants her folks to know the guy who's taking their girl away. She's not moving in here. - That's not happening. - No, no, no. NYC, man. What do you mean, "NYC, man"? Going to New York now? So, that's just it, then? No more band. I mean... Okay. Cool. Well, thanks for letting me know. You and Sticky should come. Look, I've got some new songs. And a new scene gives us freedom... Why are you doing this? We have people here who like our music, and they actually, like, come to our shows. That's everything that we've been working for. You really wanna spend the rest of your life playing the same five songs to the same 50 people - in the same club? - Man! This girl is Nancy. You're Sid and she's Nancy! And not in a good way. What, you think that's gonna work? Those rich assholes, they're gonna hate you, man. They already hate you. She digs me and her parents are gonna dig me, too. News flash. Parents don't dig you, all right? Not even your own. Damn it, I'm late! And don't grill him about his parents. He doesn't like to talk about them. - Honey. - Or is grades or whatever. He's totally smart. Sweetheart, I am gonna keep an open mind. There's so many cul-de-sacs in the neighborhood. It's easy to drive around in circles. Hello? Julie? Julie. I'm wondering if we need to buy Randy a Timex. Ha-ha. Okay, I'm gonna start. - Dad, no. - No, I am. It's rude. Your mother made a lot of food. And I don't like someone treating you like this. We've been waiting for a long time. I bet you guys are thrilled he's not here. - Don't say that, dear. - We're not thrilled, okay? But we are validated. The truth is, it is better to just find out now what kind of a person he is. You can find someone who can take care of you. Not everybody is as needy and scared of the world as you are. Jesus, guys can suck. - Yeah. - You must've been so pissed. Yeah, pissed. Embarrassed. Mostly just sad. So, I mean, was that it? It was just over? Well, I didn't know. I called and there was no answer. I thought maybe it was. But then... I'm sorry. Well, then why didn't you show up? Parents are hard for me, okay? That's your big excuse? You know what, trigonometry is hard for me, but I still show up. What do you want me to say, Julie? You want my whole pathetic life story? How my dad bailed on me before I was even born? How my mom kicked me outta the house because she wanted to start a real family? Look, you have this life. This shiny, bright, perfect... I... I saw it. I... I don't know how to fit into this. You could start by showing up. I will. Cool. I need to work on my dance moves if I'm ever gonna be on MTV. You're so good at dancing. Who has time for that? Like, I totally was watching the "Thriller" video today... Happy birthday. Is it... Oh, my God. Oh, I love it. Oh, thank you. Hey, I'm kind of having a birthday party this Saturday. Oh. I didn't know. I mean, it was, like, totally last minute. But you're totally invited as long as you're okay with, you know... Oh, my God, stop. You're, like, totally putting me in the middle - just like my mom does. - Spaz down, Stacey. God. Mickey will be there with me. Yeah. I heard about you two. Oh, yeah, what'd you hear? Was it something like, "Oh! Mickey! Oh, my God, Mickey!" We used to say that exes were off-limits. Yeah, well, we used to say a lot of stuff. What do you care now? You have Randy. God, this is so stupid. I think you guys would actually just really like him if you got to know him. Well, why don't you bring him to my birthday party? Okay. Whoo! Keep on wheelin'! Hey, that's for you. Oh, my God, thank you so much. It's a book. Oh, my God, Karen. I have tiny cars on my feet. This is really good practice. - For what? - Prom. Oh, my God, you guys came! Oh, happy birthday. - Thanks for coming. - Yeah, totally. Hey, Randy. Right on. Happy birthday. Oh, it's a scratch-off lottery ticket that's already been scratched off. You take that to any gas station, they'll give you three bucks. Cash. Oh! Thank you. I'm here with the birthday girl, and it is time for "The Safety Dance". You know the dance. Time to grab your partner and show me what you got! But if you hear the whistle, baby, you out! Stacey. Hey, hey! Stacey. Oh! Are you okay? Yeah, I take karate sometimes. We're not liable for this. ♪ We can dance, we can dance We're doing it From wall to wall ♪ ♪ We can dance, we can dance Everybody look At your hands ♪ I think I'll take a timeout. What? You sure?

This is not where I saw my life going. ♪ S-A-F-E-T-Y ♪ And we have our winners! Whoo! - That was amazing, right? - Yep. Uh-oh! If you lost a tooth, it's over at the lost and found. That was awesome. - With so many spins. - Yeah, for sure, Karen. What're you doing here, freak? I don't want any beef, dude. Where's the beef, huh? I'm cool. Just making sure you're okay, buddy. I mean, your girl was kind of all over me. You look angry. You need to cool off a little bit? Yeah, she's really something, isn't she? Oh, my God. - Oh, my God! - Fight! Fight! Guys, stop! Stop! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Get him off me! Yeah, he's crazy, man. Get off of me! Get off of me! You think I wanna be here with these trust fund jerk-offs? I'm happy to get the hell out! - Get off me! - You're done. Come on, Julie, let's go! Wow. Classy. Stacey, I am so sorry. I think that you should probably just go. - But, Stacey... - Just go, please. Thank God. I think he's actually psychotic. What was that? What is wrong with you? You realize that everything my friends ever thought about you you just proved them right? Why do you even care what they think? Because they're my friends. What, these vapid, stupid, rich, shitty people? I am one of those people, Randy. You know what, all we ever do is hang out with your friends, listen to your band, do your stuff, but the moment I even try to show you my world, you, like, totally sabotage it. I'm sorry, okay? Wait, come here. Come on. I'm sorry. All those amazing things that we said we were gonna do, let's just go and do that. None of this stuff matters! You see, that's the problem, it's that nothing matters to you. But I have things in my life that I care about, that are important to me. Don't tell me you're gonna bring up prom again. Seriously, Julie? It's like we're from different planets. If you want a prom king, maybe I'm not your guy. You know what, maybe you're not. You don't mean that. Does this look like it's working to you? I have given up everything for you. - You don't even show up. - Oh, I'm sorry. Your fake friends aren't gonna call you back? You know what, I'm sorry that I have people in my life that care about me. Okay? Right. It's not working. You know what? Forget it. For sure. Like, totally! Those tots look awfully lonely. I know how they feel. You think, uh, one of them might like to be my date to prom? What about Karen? Mmm. No, I broke up with Karen. It's never been about her. Only us. So, what do you say? Yeah. Okay. Let's do prom. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Prom could be fun. It will be fun. But it doesn't mean we're back together. Okay? All right, sweet. Yes, ma'am.

Check out a new scene? Plus, we're getting evicted, so... What do you think? You know what, let's do it. Yeah? Let's get the hell outta town. Yeah! Yeah! Stace? Will you hear me out? Like, I don't really have a choice. Look, I am so, so sorry about your birthday party, okay? And, I'm... And I'm not with him anymore. And, I know, it's not... Are you okay? I've been, like, the worst friend recently... No, I said stuff, too. But it's just... I mean, everything at home is so... I just want everything to stay the same. Yeah, totally. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. Um... I kinda got into Dartmouth. Wait, what? - You got into Dartmouth? - Uh-huh. Stace, that's amazing! I know. But you all are going to Northridge, and Karen will, like, freak out at me... No, no, no. Screw Karen! You have to go. That's Ivy League! Oh, my God! I'm going to an Ivy League school. You got in! You're a genius! You're going to Dartmouth! Oh, my God! I really have to pee, though. Oh. Okay. Sorry. Mom's letting me get a waterbed. Whoo! Yep. Oh, my God. Wow. Four years of silent treatment. Northridge is gonna be a blast. Karen? She lied. Didn't even get into Northridge. Idiot. But I got in? Maybe that's why she went nuclear on us. Hey. Don't forget that pink dress, right? The one that goes with my cummerbund. Well, I was actually thinking it might be super rad if I did something... Don't you wanna match, babe? Right. Julie. Yeah. Not babe. I want a hotdog. Let's go. You look bitchin'. Thanks. Uh, I remember my prom. It's a lot of pressure, right? Totally. Oh, my God! I know! Oh, wait. This is gonna make it, like, mega. Oh, my God. Totally! Ah. So, like, what happened with Karen? Ugh. She called you a backstabber for hanging out with him. And I was like, "Wait, you totally did the same thing but, like, way worse." And she freaked out, totally stopped the car right in the middle of Ventura and told me to get out. Yeah, and then she told me not to get out, but I did anyway. Julie! Come quick, I want you to see this. Put our fight on hold for a second. Look, look. T-minus ten, nine... You know what that is? That's the first female astronaut. That's Sally Ride. Go for main engine start and we have ignition. There she goes. There she goes. And now, lift-off for America's first woman astronaut. The launchpad is clear and STS-7 is free... There she goes. Pretty cool. Yeah. You know, I bet... I bet her parents had some scary times. You know, a daughter like that? Always wanting to blaze her own trail, you know? But, damn, I bet they're proud today.

Not anymore. Ladies, I'm single! Yeah! Not exactly how we thought prom would go, huh? Our last hurrah. Yeah. I heard about Northridge. What are you gonna do? No clue. Maybe that's good for a change.
