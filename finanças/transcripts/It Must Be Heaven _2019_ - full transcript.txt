Subtitles by YNA Christ is risen from the dead By death, he destroyed death To those who are in the tombs He grants life God rises, His enemies disperse His adversaries flee before Him This is the day the Lord has made Let him be a subject of joy and joy Doors, raise your heads Rise up, eternal gates And the King of glory will come in Open that door. My father, even if God comes down, we will not open. Open that door, I tell you. We will not open, even if the sky falls on our heads. Open before I slaughter you. I will break your bottle on your two heads. Open up. Monseigneur does not seem to understand. Father, are you blocked or what? Listen, father, go see there if we are there. When we return, we may open. Sorry, my God. Neighbor, don't believe I'm stealing from you. I usually knock on the door to ask for permission. I did, but there was nobody. Our sister says that her dish is acidic. Acid? What do you mean acid? I don't know ... There is a slightly sour taste. Sorry that you don't like it. But the bitterness comes from the wine sauce. It's desired. How do you say? - Wine, you said? Yes, wine. White. You mean our sister is boozing without our knowledge? She's not quite your sister, but rather the chicken that got drunk. Ah yes? It's going to cost you dear, you know? My mistake. I am sorry. I should have warned you. These whiskey glasses are for me. And we will fill them for you. Neighbour! It was time for this lemon tree to be pruned. You will see, lemons will be big like that. Neighbour. Neighbour... Neighbour. The other day, I was taken with a desire to go hunting. I was watching the boars and there I look up and i see a big eagle which spread its wings, two meters each. He was spinning, like he was looking for something. I watch, to see what this motherfucker spotted. And there, what do I see? A huge serpent wound in a spiral. Suddenly the eagle folds its wings and rushes at him like a rocket. Before he grabs the snake, I shoot it and he drops dead next door. The snake looks up ... and he looks. A blow to me, a blow to the eagle, then me again. And there he looks up, he does this to me and he cuts the road. A few days later, I was bored at home. I told my wife that I was going for a ride. I took my gun to go hunting. The evening fell and the air is refreshed. I had twelve partridges hanging from my waist. I said to myself: I'm going home. I get to my Jeep, I see her leaning, like that. The flat punctured rear tire. And then I hear noise in the bushes. I point my gun, thinking of a hyena, ready to devour me. I'm going to eat you, I thought. I only had one bullet left. I point my gun and just before I press on the trigger, who I see? The snake! The same snake. He comes towards me, my rifle still pointed at him, he exceeds me and goes straight towards the flat tire. He opens his mouth and stuffs the valve. And there he breathes and blows into the tire. Inhale Exhale. The tire inflated to block, hard as wood. And then he looks at me, straightens his neck, do that to me and cut the road. Neighbour, I'm going to go home, have a barbecue with a touch of arak. Come, neighbor, Iâ€™m waiting for you. Come here! Get out. Neighbour, I've never peed so much in my life. No way to stop. Thief. - Your education. Damn. - Your shit. Dirt. - Your filth. Drunkard. - You `ve seen? Thug. - Your model. Rot. - Your stench. Mackerel. - In your mess. Scraping. - From father to son. Son of a bitch. - And from you. Hoerenzoon. - Ik ben jouw zoon. Are you Brigitte? Brigitte San?

Guess who I have in my taxi. A Palestinian. Have you ever seen a Palestinian? Karafat, does that speak to you? No, I don't drive Karafat, but a type of Nazareth. Jesus of Nazareth! First of all, welcome to New York. Our school is delighted to welcome you. To begin, I would like to you let us know from your experience as a filmmaker and you talk to us of your ways of being and feeling who allowed you, or not, to meet the conditions to become what is called a citizen of the world. Is your identity no longer linked to a past place? Your nomadic existence did she wipe out your love of a place to extend it to all places? In other words, are you a perfect stranger? And now, I will introduce you our speakers: Ali Maarabouni ... Fadwa Amine ... Widad Sharif. Dear brothers and sisters, Please listen to me. As you see it, we have many speakers. Our heroes. Our beloved compatriots. From our beloved land, Palestine. The friends! Please listen to me. Silence, you must calm down. Please Our speakers know that you support their struggle, with conviction and loyalty. But if we keep clapping like that, the session will be over before they have spoken. So, please, a little calm. An applause will suffice. It will be fine, believe me. Like that. Okay? MetaFilm. She's busy, can she call you back? It's okay? Okay. Hallo. What's up? Nothing, I'm here. I have an appointment with an American producer. Finally, not American, I don't know where she is from. It is for a project on the conquest of Mexico. For the 500 years of the conquest. On Cortes, Moctezuma and company. But they want to do it in English. In English, do you imagine? They want the Spanish to speak English. And the natives, they speak Nahuatl or whatever, they do not care. It will do something like: 'Hello, my name is Hernando Cortes and I want to conquer you. ' It's going to be downright horrible. I will not do it, I'll tell her no. I'm here with my friend Elia, Elia Suleiman. He's a Palestinian from ... Not a Palestinian from Israel. He is a Palestinian from Palestine. Yes, from Palestine. From Palestine! Look, we're talking later. Sorry, call you back, hi. Hello, Gael. How are you? - Good and you? Very good. Happy to see you, It's been a long time. You look tired. Are you sure you're okay? I am in good shape. I present to you a very good friend: Elia Suleiman. He's a Palestinian director. Nice to meet you. - But his films are funny. He is preparing a comedy on peace in the Middle East. It's funny in itself. The title is Heaven Can Wait . We're late, darling. We can go? Yes. Good luck with your movie. Delighted. Do you want a taxi? This is interesting. Will there be a Palestine? Will there be a Palestine? There will be a Palestine. Absolutely. It's sure and certain. Wait. Wait. Okay. There will be a Palestine. For sure. But... But... It won't be in your lifetime or mine. Listen, you will excuse me, but I would like to tell you something. You Palestinians are weird. The whole world drinks to forget. You are the only people who drinks to remember. Health. To Palestine In memory of John Berger, Humbert Balsan, my mother and father Subtitles by YNA
