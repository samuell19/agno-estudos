Well, let's see, he was in charge of me, my life, me. But he comes up every once in a while just in my mind. The name is very clear. Sator, it was Sator, who was in charge of everything. All upon the face of the forest, shall tremble at his presence. And the mountains shall be thrown down. For Sator's eyes are in every place on those who fear him, On those who hope for his kindness. his acceptance. Every beast of the forest, everything that moves is his. Sator has made a covenant of peace, illuminating all harmful beasts from this land. And uses their flesh to cloak his disciples, so that we may all live securely in the wilderness and sleep soundly in the woods. We find you stranded in a howling waste of a wilderness. We observe you. We learn all about your ways. And when the sun rises, we withdraw and lie down in our dens. Hmm. Hmm. What? Hmm. Get out of my head. I bet the card's messed up. Who's cam is this? Grandpa Jim's? Yeah. Hmm. You hunting deer? Mm. You know grandpa kept a lot of gear at the main house, right? Probably had another one of these. Some beer too. Wanna stop by? I would have put a shotgun in my mouth by now, if this is where I thought I'd end up. Fuckin' Deborah. She could have fought a little harder for you to be where I'm at. I'm telling ya, man, if you would have just talked about Sator, I guarantee the home would have accepted your ass. all kind of places. Well I'm not anyone who gets up to anything anymore. Not up to anything? No, I sit in this spot here. But my brain's dead. - Mine too. - Oh. Welcome to the crowd. - Yeah. - No, I don't know, I, memory is something I lose. I pick up something in the house, take it around and put it down, and then I can't find it again. - I forgot where I put it. - Yeah. Ha, I wasn't lucky when Jim died, but when he did, they still let me stay on here. I've just been here ever since then. I don't know how many years since Jim died. I miss him every day. So distracted down here. Forget to look up sometimes. I'm Evie. Can I help you look for anything? Don't drink all of these. When you summon Sator, he will turn his attention to you. Submit yourself to him, trust in him completely. And do not lean on your own understanding. You will be tested by affliction for he is a consuming fire. And after you have suffered a little while, he will refine you. He will make you pure. - Hi, Nani. - Oh, hi there. How are you? How come you my name and I don't know who you are? Oh, hello. - Hi. - Hi. Good to see you. Fred, Jack, Joe? You know, you know me. - No, I don't. - You know. I don't recognize you. Why is that? I don't know. - It'll come to you. - Oh, I don't know why. I just don't recognize you for some reason. I'm your grandson. Well I thought so, but you got a beard, you've grown considerably since I last saw you. I was just here yesterday. - Yesterday? - Mm-hmm. Yeah. We had a good talk yesterday. - Who did? - Me and you. How you've been sensing spirits. I don't remember yesterday. Oh, that's okay. What kind of things did... What kind of things happen around here that are peculiar? You sure that was yesterday? I'm pretty sure that was yesterday. Well occasionally, something happens. - Yeah. - Yeah? Things are, they'll be moved somewhere - from one place to another. - Yeah. You put something somewhere- Yeah, and you know darn well - you didn't do it yourself. - Mm-hmm. Hey, where are you? Are you in here? Come on, where are you? Oh, there you are. What are you doing? What's going on with you? You playing hide and go seek? - Who are you? - Okay. Oh, my God. I used to do automatic writing, and I was told what to write by spirit. It's implanted in your brain? - Yeah. - And you just transfer it from some other entity that's telling you what to write down Yeah, it's that sort of thing. Like my guardian I have a guardian that I, he, he's always there. I always, he's gonna just let me know something is not right. - Mm-hmm. - If it's going to be a good thing or something I... Sator is like a human being that lives around here somewhere. Somebody who manages to get into my brain and talk to me. Knew everybody, what they were saying and doing. And he was aware of everything that was done and what should be done and what has to be done, what wasn't done. How you people are this and that. Sator would help me, was teaching me, training me to be a person. Every once in a while, I just wake up in bed and he's there. He talks to me. It's interesting to have that kind of care. The talking in my head. I have nothing to do with it. It just starts, and I listen, and if I'm supposed to write it down. I write it down or whatever. I don't know. People think you're nuts if you tell them that. Well I don't think you're nuts. Oh good, I hope not. Although, when I feel like wanting something that I want to know about or think about or something, I just think about it and he comes in my brain, or he manages to make me aware of him, talks to me and do, you know, make me do some things and stuff. That was just a period of time. - Mm-hmm. - Then I went off on my own way, I'd guess you'd say. I still wrote stuff. What's that for? I would hear from him occasionally, have something written to me. When I've taken something - and tried to write on it, - Come on. He gets in there and telling me I should not be saying and doing what I was doing and saying. My dog ran off. I'm sorry. Things got so complicated and too many people involved. - Think something hurt him? - He still gets a word in every once in a while that I'm aware of. Although he did, he talked to James. Jimmy. I'll keep an eye out. I don't know any more. Time has swallowed it all up. Well that's very interesting, Nani. I had voices. I get messages, and I still do in a sense. And he comes to the house. He comes here, Sator does, often. And just not in this particular area but out there where he comes and stands around and and just watches what I'm doing or whoever else is there, you know, he watches them. And it still happens. I still get messages from Sator. Ugh, Sator can fuck off, dude! I don't know what else to do, dude, and like, he's holding Ma hostage somewhere and doesn't want her to fucking remember. Goddammit. I don't know, maybe, I think I need a cigarette right now. Seriously though, Brother. trips me the fuck out what the brain chooses to hold on to. Like helping Grandpa Jim build his cabin. I have this image really fucking clear in my mind. But then I found a photograph of this, and that's what I'm actually seeing is a damn photograph. I don't remember that day at all. It's the same shit with Evie. I have all these photographs, but I can't remember her or the accident. And that shit was recent. But we were fucked up most of the time together. So I guess that's different. This is Sator. Your path to purification will be tried with fire, only then will I make you in my image. But first, I will send a messenger to your temple. One who shall prepare the way before you. Are you fucking kidding? What the fuck? For this messenger will be like a refiner's fire, and will sit as a refiner. Are you ready to have dominion over every creeping thing that creeps? Ready to cleansed and purified. To join Sator as one of his disciples. I am now waiting for your burnt offering. I delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices just as much as you, obeying my voice. Hi, Adam. Your dog ever come back? I brought you something. It was hidden at your grandmother's. I didn't know when you would be back, so I thought you might wanna have it. It was with Pete in that accident. Glad he made it out okay. Thought that'd be a nice memory to have. Sorry about your mom. Was anybody able to find her? I was in a similar situation, and Pete was the only person I had to go to. I think you're lucky to have someone like Deborah. She really kept it together for the both of you. I hope one day the three of you can come together. Sator has searched you and he knows you. He knows when you rest and when you rise. He perceives your thoughts from afar. He observes you're going out and is familiar with all your ways. When you lay your hand upon Sator, such knowledge will be too wonderful, too high for you to attain. There is nothing covered up that will not be revealed, and secrets that will not be known. He who reveals the profound and the hidden, will know what is in the darkness. What can't be seen in the dark, can be shown in the light. Well, I don't know what to fucking tell you, Brother. Your dog's gone. Should have held it together for Deborah. So fucked, this was all put on her. Shouldn't have to put up with all our bullshit. I still think grandpa Jim sacrificed himself. So Ma could be with Sator. You know there was a lot of weird shit going on there. I don't think Mom could have fucking done that herself. Bet Nani was in on it too. Sorry we couldn't find your dog, dude What's going on with you, Brother? ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ We want cake! We want cake! We want cake! We want cake! We want cake! - What is this thing? - Ooh! Got in there, an atomic bomb? What? Shouldn't Ma be here for this? You really think you're gonna get her - to come out here? - I'm not going back there, Deborah. First I will send a messenger to your temple. One who shall prepare the way before you. Are you fucking kidding me? What the fuck? Go back there. We need to burn those fucking writings. I wanna get Adam out of this place. You wanna take him to Midground and go see Evie? Or not. Do you think that's smart? Hmm? Having him around that many people? Adam? Adam? Hey? Did I hurt you? Where do you go when you do that? Anyone talking to you? Like with Nani and Mom? Is it Sator? Uhhhahh!! Do you know what these are? It's my handwriting, but I, it, I can't read it anymore here. They're your automatic writings. Yeah. Oh. - You'd get in trances and - Yeah. - spirits would write for you. - Yeah, well somewhere along the lines there, I wanted to have something going on in my life. The next thing I found out was that in my head, I was being told about things. For a long time there, I was writing down stuff that was given to me, like people talking to me. So I would listen, just listen, and write down what was being said in my head. You know, I had access to them. Even now I can see them. The people hopping around in my head. Did you know mom was also able to hear them? Your mother you're talking about? - Mm-hmm. - No. I think she was trying to join them. - Well, it's a good possibility. - Yeah. Look at this one. "They've chosen you from the furnace of affliction. You may now present an offering by fire before purification as a soothing aroma to Sator." Hmm. Do you remember the day that Grandpa Jim died? Yes. That was sad. He seemed to be involved in it quite a lot, and we had discussed his dying somewhere before, that this is what he is intending to do. And he walked out of the house and went out laid down in the grass and and we found him, and he died there. That's all I remember at this time. - Yeah. - 'Cause he died. Mm-hmm. Um... His death caused Pete to get into - a lot of trouble with Evie. - Oh my, yeah. He's been in a home now for a while. He gets out today. - Oh. - I get to pick him up. Oh. We have to show him how proud we are of him. For all the progress he's been making to get better. Yes, yes, that's important to him. Do you think that you can help me - with that, Nani? - Sure, yeah. I can try. Thanks. Think it's genetic? What, dementia? The voices. Well if it is, I'm glad Nani never hurt anybody. Ma didn't either. If you still think Sator killed Grandpa Jim, we can send you back there right now. I have no problem with that. What about Adam? - What about him? - Can we visit him? No. I feel bad for just leaving them up there. Excuse me? You feel bad because you left him up there? Did you even see how it wasn't exactly safe for him to be around us? 'Cause I don't remember you making the decision to isolate him from everyone because you didn't. I left him out there. Give me a goddamn break, Pete. Mm. It's been nice talking to a friendly face, but I must find my brother and get home. I have a long road ahead of me, and I can't waste any more time. Mm. Right at home with the people, the beaches, the cool waves. Welcome to Midground. A perfect family vacation. Come stay in the Blaze Inn Hotel, with breathtaking views of Younglove Island. Take leisurely strolls... Mm. You want company? I'm all right. Mm. Adam? Hmm. Ehh. Ah. You going to get ready for bed, Nani? Hey, Nani? Nani? Nani? No! Doesn't anyone talk to you in your head. I don't know how to explain it. It's just, it's been given to me. Sator will send messages that land in my head. And so do the other people who if they want to will just talk to me. Right here, talking to me. Like you now... What is it that you need? What do you want to know for sure? That Sator loves you? That he cares about you? That you're being good? That you're not being good about some things, a little antagonistic, at times. Well, I don't know where this comes from. I find you quite well organized, and take good care of me and what's here. And I get this voice saying, and does what we tell you to. Okay, your turn. Any messages coming?
