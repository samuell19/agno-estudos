Oh my God. My God! You're, you're - Jane. - You're Jane. I can't deal with a Jane. Where's your, your, your thing? I'm not gay. You think I wanted to shove that cucumber up my ass? Did you think I wasn't going to see it? How did that work in your mind? Did you think I wasn't going to notice you have a large plant taped to your... Oh my God, oh my. I feel so violated. - Mr. Barney Did you ever have a dream? A most sensational inspirational celebrational dream? - Excuse me? - I just did this so I could be with Gerry. I didn't want you to get all mad and stuff. - I'm not mad, I'm just... Crap, I don't know. So, who's this Gerry guy, is that your pimp? - Pimp? No, he's just the one that told me to dress like a closet transvestite prostitute. - Oh. So he's your pimp. - No, he's my daddy. - So what else does your daddy pimp want you to do? - He's made me write love letters to a serial killer in prison. - Oh, which one? - Folsom. - No, which killer? - Kenny Kingman. - The Lollypop Killer, oh, he's bad news. So you're in love with a serial killer? - Nah, I mean he's all right, but, look, Mr. Barney, falling in love it seemed so easy, but none of the things dad wants me to do are easy. So I have a plan B. - Shove that cucumber up my ass? - No, I'm saving up. I'm saving up so I can see him in Chicago, the land of wishes, hopes and dreams. And you know what? I'm real, real, close. - Look, maybe I should head back to the wife. you know it's late and, it's just, kinda weird. - Sorry. - No, no, it's not you. It's me. You know, with the others it was a lot easier. You know it didn't seem like cheating, it was just something different, but you, you're a Jane, and we're in a motel room and that's weird. I am such a jerk. I'm not gay. Okay, maybe a little bit, but like a pinky's worth of gayness, barely noticeable, but I love my wife. Maybe I should talk to her. Maybe I should talk to her? That's the ticket. Maybe she'll understand. Maybe I'll understand, what I'm doing. I am not going to hurt my wife anymore! Do you hear me? I am not going to hurt my wife anymore! Can you give me a ride home? Make a right. No, not there! Not there, here! Turn left at the sign. Yeah, and the third house, 704 Hauser Street. This is the start of something beautiful, I can smell it. Thank you, Jane. You've helped me put some perspective back into my life. I now know that I was hurting the one that I love in a profound and meaningful way. So how much do you need to see your daddy in Chicago? - Three dollars and 42 cents. - Well, good luck. Do you have change for a five? Say hi to Gerry for me. Your pimp sounds like a really lucky guy. - He's not my pimp. Dear Kenny. I'm glad you are well. Please don't write to me again cause Mr. Barney gave me enough money to go to Chicago to be with Daddy. I don't need to fall in love with you anymore. So, um, thanks. Besides, you're a serial killer. Good luck with the lethal injection and everything. Love and kisses, Jane White. (singing) It's the Jane White Show! It's the Jane White Show.

Oh, noodle nose, you haven't been watching that idiot box, have you? Of course not. Is that? You're not wearing eye liner are you? No, I don't like it. And do you know why? - Because boys will get aroused and get me drunk - (together) at a bar and take me home and play Barry White and have sex with me. (laugh track) - And get you pregnant, and then leave you, alone, with a child. And even if that child is the most special thing in the whole world, it wouldn't matter. Because every time you look into her eyes you will be reminded of the abandonment. And hate every day you're alive because of the feelings of resentment and loneliness, and you'll end up a bitter old woman with no friends at all except the one person responsible for the whole damn mess in the first place. Your child. - [Audience] Ooo... - Oh, oh (crying). - Oh, sweetheart, sweetheart, I was talking about you, not me, you are the most precious person in my life. - [Audience] Aw! - I love... here. - [Audience] (laughing) - Our house is a very very very strong house.

Okay, no world, just a little four-knuckle love shuffle, and some kindness. - Betsy will take you. Tonight! Oh Jane, it'll be monumental. Shh.. Ever since I first laid eyes on you in the bus station I knew that we were meant to be together. And now that I've got you I'm not ever going to let you go. I'm going to handcuff you to my heart, and stab you repeatedly with my love. - Okay, just a hand job and then I'm outta here.

I ain't a particularly religious man, at least I wasn't until a couple month ago. - Yeah 12 months to the year, Gerry. - Shut up, bitch, I'm the son of God. I'll smite you. - You don't even know what that means. - Why you up in my face, don't you know who I am? - You see this, Gerry, we haven't had sex in eight months. - Yeah, that is because my dick has been blessed by God.

But because we can now take a deep breath, relax, and know that everything is going to be all right. That no matter horrors lie in our future... (snoring) This is Gerry King for The Gerry Show saying, be kind, be happy, be free. (audience applause) - [Announcer] Next on The Gerry Show, how my alien abduction gave my sex life super powers. If you've been abducted by extra-terretrals, and notice that your sexual performance has improved or your partner has been abducted with similar results, - Yes! - [Announcer] then call us at The Gerry Show today. - Gee, I forgot the soap. - This is the most greatest thing in the whole world. Better than Sweet Valley High. Better than Saved by the Bell! - Oh, that Screech is funny. - If we find aliens and get supernatural sex powers, we could have it all! There is no way Dad won't see me now. We could take home the grand prize, the final spin, three joker's secret password, final jeopardy. So, let's do it. - Right here? Right now? Or in Chicago? - No, in the desert. (dramatic music) - The desert? - Yes! Doesn't it feel so right? Doesn't it feel as fantastic as a Christmas special with Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Abominable Snowman? What's the matter? You're losing color. - I'm fine. I would travel to the ends of the earth for you, my dear, but you must tell me, why the desert? - Aliens love the desert. - Aliens love swamp gas and drunken old fishermen and moonshine. - No, silly. The X-Files, Area 51, Project Bluebook, Millennium, 3rd Rock from the Sun, duh! That is where it'll happen! That is where we'll get abducted and get, you know, those powers. - Of course. The desert. Far away from people, no phones, no human contact. Alone. Okay. I will take you to the desert and we will be abducted by aliens if that is what you wish. - Then set a course for adventure. This is going to be the most perfectest weekend of my life! (zany music) (yawning) Are we here? - Yeah. Yeah. The desert. (dramatic music) - I gotta pee. (ominous music) - There. Jane? Jane? Jane, where are you? Oh my God, she's left me. Oh my God what have I done, Jane! Jane! - I'm over here. See! - Ah ah ah - Ah ah ah - Are you cold? You're all white or something. - Ah ah ah ah - Did an alien get you already? - Ah ah ah ah - How's your sex drive? - Don't you ever ever do anything like that again Jane. You promise me, do you understand? - Pee? - You know exactly what I'm talking about Jane. You ignorant slut! I'm, I'm sorry. Could we maybe pretend that that never happened? - Whatchu talkin' 'bout, Dick? - Thanks. Let's prepare our camp, sweetness. (ominous music) (echoing voices) - [Dick] And now that I've got you I'm not ever going to... [News Anchor] Authorities are saying that Kenny Kingman, also known as the Lollypop Killer, has escaped from Folsom State Prison. - [Mom] Men are evil, men are evil, men are evil - Stay back! Back! I know all about you. You and your past. What the heck was I thinking? You were going to serial kill the aliens, weren't you? What in the world did they ever do to you? They're cute, and green, and Gerry says they can give us supernatural sex powers. Is that it? You don't like green things? - Jane, listen to me. When I was very young, I went camping with my father. - So? When I was four I went to the market with my mother. - Shortly after 2:33 A.M., Father, having indigestion from our nightly kill, you see, all of us boys knew how to hunt. Father, exited the safety of our camp to excrete the evening's fare. The scream, Jane. The scream. Such pain and horror and surprise. I jumped up thinking that it was a nightmare. But I was awake. And it was real. I tried to get out of my sleeping bag but I was caught and confused. Finally, through a clearing, I saw it. A mighty, 39-point buck was humping my father. With great speed and ferocity. My father and I locked eyes, him, unable to escape the buck's embrace, me, unable to help him. It must have gotten him when he bent over to... The buck leaned its head back, and it let loose a lustful squeal (squealing) (thudding) - I'm so sorry. - Naturally, Jane, when you said you wanted to come into the desert, all of this came flooding back to me. And then, when you, you know, when you went number one over there, I vowed that I would never again experience that type of horror, Jane. I just want to protect you. From everything. Including aliens. I'm so sorry, can you forgive me? - Is that what you wanted to tell me? That was very Party of Five of you.

And then nothing will stop me, I will see everything. - But what about the aliens? - Well, maybe it's okay if we don't see the aliens tonight. - But Jane it means so much to you. - I have you. And Betsy can still take us to Chicago. - But darling if I don't produce the aliens for you then I've failed you. However, if Gerry's next topic is the most in-love people in the entire world, then surely we will be his next guests, because anyone else who attempts to claim that mantle will be a fraud. - No, no the topic is, I'm in love with a serial killer. - Well, if you have killed me a thousand times with your loving heart then you are truly that serial killer. - No, you are. - Then I am your serial killer. - You don't have to sound like a Hallmark card. I know all about you. And it's perfect! You and me and Gerry, it's all I ever wanted. It's just us here in the middle of nowhere, alone, cut off from everyone with a serial killer. - What? Serial killer? Where? - Kenny? Kenny Kingman? The Lollypop Killer, you escaped. Oh my God. - Jane, Jane you're talking in riddles, honey, I don't understand. - Who the heck are you? - Believe it or not it's just me. Just Dick. I'm Dick, Dick Smith.

You tried to look like him, just to make me fall in love with you and bring me out to this stupid desert. - Jane, you are sounding insane. We came out here into the desert so we could abducted by aliens and get supernatural sex powers. - Oh I found the alien, it's you. - Jane? Jane! - Bite me, pig. (guitar music) - Jane! Jane!

Okay, approximately four minutes ago at the taping of his show Gerry, host and international star of The Gerry Show and former mayor of Chicago, was brutally and viciously butchered on his live show earlier today. Luckily, we have it all on tape. The topic, my daughter is a Clover Scout Nazi. Re-roll the tape, re-roll that now. Let's see that again, but can you slow it down a bit? I believe we can see the moment just when Gerry loses all consciousness and hope of living. Can we see that on camera two? There. Now can you shuttle frame that last image? And zoom it. Yes, good. Now there, you see it? You know just frame by frame until we get to the last image in one more moment, yes, there it is, there is where is life it gone, that is the moment where he is no more, right there. Could we roll that back at all? We can? Good. Wait a minute, we're going to roll the tape? - Daddy (crying) - [TV] Ah-huh. Oh, look at that, that is a moment. Tough luck. - Daddy! (crying) (dramatic music) - Damn you Clover Scouts of America. (pop music) Left. Right. No, there. Right here. - So how was Chicago? - He was my dad, you know? - Who? - Gerry. - Oh, the pimp. - And now he's dead. Dead because of that stupid idiot midget Clover Scout. Why Mr. Barney? Why did she have to kill him? - Maybe the other pimp wanted his bitches. - You think? You think maybe it was Sally or Oprah? - Sure. Oprah. That name sounds pretty evil. - That bitch. I think I'm going to throw up. - Oh, roll down the... Window. - Sorry. (pop music) - Counseling. - Huh? - My wife and I we're in counseling now. - Is it helping? - Yeah, it's pretty good. Look, I'm sorry your pimp died. - He wasn't my pimp. He was my father. - Man, that's twisted. (pop music) - He touched you didn't he? Didn't he? - The aliens? - What? What aliens? - No aliens, we didn't see any. - See any what? - Aliens. - There were Mexicans with you? - He's not Mexican. - Who, the alien? - No, Dick. - Dick, the Mexican? - No, Dick the dick, he's just Dick. He's not Dick the Mexican or Dick the Alien, or Dick the serial killer. - Look, honey, I don't care if he's Mexican, that's not the point. - He could be Mexican but I don't think so. Mom I'm really tired. - Did Dick the Mexican, or the Alien, rape you? - Mom! Dick the dick and I didn't vo-di-oh-do. What about you and Burger? - What? Don't be stupid. And don't try to change the subject. - I got to Mrs. White. Hey, Janie, how you doing? - [Jane] Hi Burger. - Burger, so did you get that order for tomorrow? You know the brushes and the things? - No, uh-huh, you want me to pick up some brushes for ya? - Okay then, goodnight, Burger. - Whatever. (dramatic music) - Goodnight, Burger. Don't forget those brushes and the things. Yeah, oh yeah I'm going to bring a brush back later and dip it in some more of that pie. Everyone wants a taste of the Burger. Nighty-night Janie. - Where were we? Oh yes, the Mexican. - I tried Mom, I tried ever since I saw Dad on TV. - What? What are you talking about? Your father's never been on TV. - Now who's stupid? - Your father sold TVs for a living, but he was never on TV. Don't you remember your father? - My father was going to have me on his show right after I fell in love with a serial killer, and he was going to take me away from you and this stupid house and this stupid city and this stupid life! - Your father is Mel Martin Benjamin White. And he sold televisions at BBW Appliance at Oak Park.... - No! Stop it! He left us when I was eight to be the mayor of Chicago and to start his TV show. - Is this what television has done to you? Booger butt! (dramatic music) - Where's my door? Where's my window? Mom? Mom? - Your boob tube's in my room, I... - My shows? - So I'm the bad person here? The freak? I'm the terrible parent? - What do you want? Who are you? - I'm your mother. I am not some god damn television show. That box doesn't need you. I need you. That tube can't give you what I can. - You're wrong. That box gives me my freedom. It takes me out of here. It takes me to Green Acres and to Central Perk, it takes me sailing across the galaxy on Voyager, and plants me on a barstool where everybody knows my name. I can buy shoes from Al Bundy, it lets me take a trip on Road Rules. On my TV I can roam the sewers with real monsters, my doctor is Mark Greene and I live at 1313 Mockingbird Lane where the kisses are hers and hers and his, and I have friends too, Mom. Frasier and Sigmund and Homer and Tutti and Elly May and Mr. Rogers and Samantha and Horshack and Roscoe P. Coltrane. - I thought I was your friend. - You took away my door. - You tried to run away with a Mexican. - So? You take away my TV? You take away my tapes? You call yourself my friend? (saxophone music) (piano music) Daddy? It's me, Jane White. I never made it to your show. I missed it by that much. But I tried. Is that okay? I don't know, just, why did you always have to pick such a hard topic? Why couldn't you do something simple? Something about my life? I'm not a lesbian grandmother and I'm not sleeping with my best friend's father. - Jane! Jane! (dramatic music) - Dick? Dick? Dick? - Jane! Jane! - Dick? Dick? (screaming) - You remembered my name! - Dick, what is this? - This is a gift, for you my darling. (screaming) If it is a serial killer you want, then a serial killer I shall be. We will be on The Gerry Show, you and I. (screaming) I love you Jane White, with all my heart and soul. But my petal, whatever is wrong? - Dick, Gerry's dead. The show's over. - Oh. (moaning) That sucks. - It sucks so much. I miss him Dick, I want him back. It is so not fair. - [Mom] Pumpkin? Darling? - Um, Dick, I've got to go. - Wait! (crunching) (screaming and moaning) - What? - Jane, if you can wait for a few life sentences, I promise you I will always be there for you. For us. Forever. - Oh, silly Dicky wicky. What's a few life sentences? I bet we've been together for a million years, and I bet we'll be together for a million more. (romantic music) - (mumbling) No, turn your head, okay - Ah! - You are frappalicious, Jane. Now go, I don't want you to see this. - You'll be okay? - I'll be fine. The only thing that can hurt me now is a meteor. Or the plague. - I love you Dick Smith. Always, I will be with you every step of the trial on Court TV. (crunching) - Ow! - Is that Mr. Peterson you're standing on there? Damn. He must workout. - Jane? - Come on. (piano music) (glass shattering) Daddy? ♪ D is for donut, D is for donut, dunk it in your milk, D! ♪ E is for elephant, E is for Elephant - [Mom] Honey, I wish you'd take those TVs back to the appliance store. ♪ E is for elephant, E is for elephant (glass crashing) ♪ F is for fireman, F is for fireman - [Gerry] Stay right there, I have a surprise for you. Ladies and gentlemen, he was convicted for 13 counts of first degree murder, 50 counts of child molestation, has over 65 felony arrests and last month just... - Daddy? Mommy? Mom? - Hello, Jane. - Burger? (dramatic music) You're not Burger. - Do you know who I am? - You're Kenny Kingman, the Lollipop Killer. Um, Beau Bridges played you in the movie of the week. - Yes. Yes, he did. - You want some milk? It does a body good. - No. - You want to watch television? It's must see TV. - No. You know what I want. - Another lollypop? - You write good letters, and you have really pretty boobies. (dramatic music) Ow! - Oh my God, you killed Mr. Kingman! You bastard! I guess TV can save lives too. - It sure can. - Oh Dick you're so silly. - Am not! - Are too! - Am not! - Are too! - Are not! Infinity not! - Pretending to kill my neighbors when really it was the serial killer Kenny Kingman. - Uh-huh. Yeah, okay. Yeah. - Why didn't you just tell me you didn't do it? I would still love you. - Well, you see Jane... Jane! Ooo, you thought he was me? Jane, he doesn't look anything like me, that guy weighs close to like 300 pounds. Jane, he's like 60 years old! - Dick, sorry. They were using old pictures on the computer. - He's a whale, Jane! That guy didn't kill his victims, he must have ate them all. Is that how you see me, Jane? Is that how you see me? Tell me the truth. - Well, you do look a little like Beau Bridges. - Beau Bridges? Ooo! Jeff Bridges is the cute one, Jane. Geez! - [Mom] Sweetheart? Honey? Did you see? Did you see me? I went outside! I saw my car and our mailbox, and a bunch of people lying in the street. - I know, I know. Life is a ball again, laughter is calling for you. - I love you, Booger Butt. - I love you too, Mom. Oh, Mom. I want you to meet Dick Smith. - You're the Mexican. (dramatic music) - Mexican? Oh great, now I'm Mexican. First I'm Shamu, and now I'm Mexican. - What do you want here? - Well, I.. - We're in love. I know that I'm not smart enough to leave you, but Dick is. - What do you mean? But? - We are going to see the world, and be the masters of our domain. - We are? - Yes, and we're going to meet interesting people and boldly go where no man has gone before. - What about me? - Mom, you have Burger. - It's not the same. - I know, you can have sex with him. Mom, it's been too long. Dad died a long time ago, you should be free and happy and have fun. - Like you, Jane White. - Like me. Come on, Dick. - Jane, wait! Where do you want to go today? - I don't know, how about Sesame Street? - Oh that's great, that's great. I always wanted to meet Big Bird. Oh, or Twin Peaks, that place is so scary. - I have an uncle in St. Olaf. - [Dick] How about the Twilight Zone? Ooo, or we could go to the Outer Limits. Or Springfield, nobody really knows how to get there, but I know we'll find a way. - Okay - [Dick] It's going to be so cool. ♪ She only watches TV ♪ That's all she wants to see ♪ When she's got her clicker ♪ She's happy as can be ♪ It's the Jane White Show ♪ It's the Jane White Show ♪ She's the girl you really ought to get to know ♪ Hey as the world turns ♪ She takes a quantum leap ♪ Having good times on road rules ♪ from Springfield to Twin Peaks ♪ Whoa!

Until a new replacement can be found, episodes of Manimal will be airing in all time zones. As you may recall, he's part animal, he's part man, he's Manimal. - Okay we have a question here, yes, you sir, what is your name? - Hi, I'm Terry. When did you know you were Jesus Christ? - Ever since I was able to walk on water. - Would it make you feel better if we had sex? - Jane you realize I can't allow aliens to take you away from me? For if I were to sit idly by and allow your abduction to occur my heart would be empty and my soul would mourn for all eternity. - Silly, they'll take both of us. - The tribe has spoken. Hey isn't that a UFO? - Well according to this we were supposed to hit the 54 freeway two inches ago. - Over there, you stay over there. - But Jane I have the knife. - Well, I said put it down. - People are basically narrow-minded bigots, and jerk wads. - I sure love this neighborhood. A lot of fine people. All lying in the road. - Who could that be? Maybe it's some of your friends from school (laughing). That's a joke!

Or at least bring me a beer. - [Burger] Hi. - Oh there's a serial killer stuck in your bedroom floor. Beau Bridges played you in the movie of the week. - Yes. Yes he did. Though I thought his portrayal of my angst against society was a little melodramatic. - How dare you speak to me that way? I was just trying to protect you. - From who? Door people? Window people? - What are you staring at, bitch? - [Audience] Ooo! - Do you know where the 54 freeway is? - Yeah, it's up my ass! - [Little girl] Ass ass ass ass ass Now get the hell out of here. - What do you say you tell me what two times four is? - 34,302. - Is that your final answer? - 94? - 68? - Eight? - 32? - Hey, you just got it! Two times four is eight! - Really? Math is easy! - [Director] And action. - Serial killer? Where? - [Jane] Here. - Here here? Where here? You there? - [Jane] No, you there here, there. - Me here? Sorry, my braces. - [Director] Cut. - It's the Jane White Show, this is the song to the Jane White Show. There's some dog poop and a used condom on the Jane White Show. And who's singing the song to the Jane White Show. Jane White, Jane White, Jane White. On the Jane White Show! That's a big bump. - Lost lost lost lost lost lost lost - [Director] Ass ass ass ass ass ass, okay? - Should I do the line after that? - [Director] Oh what's the next one? - Blowjob. - Apple take one. - You gotta wait for them, for camera to say "mark." And action! - Man, I don't know what we're doing. - Say Hi to Gerry for me. Your pimp sounds like a really lucky guy. - He's not my pimp. He's my dad. - I just locked the door. - Jane? - I love you. - I love you. - [Director] Cut! - Well Betsy will drive you, it'll be magnificent. That's not the right thing to say, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. - [Director] Cut! - Also the fight was pinpointed to the foreman of the Prendergrast Tool and Dye Company and Mr. Archibald Helmenskin Buck-hilton.
