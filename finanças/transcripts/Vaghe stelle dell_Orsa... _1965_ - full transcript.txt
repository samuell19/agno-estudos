Good evening, Anne Marie. -How are you, JQ? -Good night. -How are you, Jean? -Good night. -Is the night lively? -Yes, all over Geneva. Same? No, listen to the truth. I tell you we've seen each other before. Believe me. Not at all. Glad to. Alan, Alan, para voc . Sandra, you are an angel! Sandra, you are more beautiful every day. Don't talk nonsense. Want a drink? Don't want anything? Thanks. - You're welcome! - Fortunately I have a good character because otherwise it would annoy them. Ah, Andrew! Are you leaving tomorrow? Sim, amanh�. Honey, is everything okay? This music. Let's get closer, will you? - Thanks. - Good luck, dear Sandra. - I'll wait for you in America. - Good trip. - You promised me. -It can wait. Well, Sandra, have a good trip. - Good night. Thank you very much. - Thanks. Goodnight. Have a good trip, Andrew. Have a good trip! Goodnight. I am dead. Me too. I don't stop standing Get everything in order. We should leave early tomorrow. It seems to me that everything went well and everyone had fun. Yes. In addition, a lot of people came. All came. -Did you like it? - Yes. - Want a whiskey? - Just a little. -Drink from mine. Thanks. -Good night. -Good night. Thanks for everything. They are! Dark? Hope. Do you think we'll be here in half an hour or more? Maybe less. Matted, we'll arrive in half an hour or so. Sim. I hope he recondemns me. Sim. Well, I'll take care of it myself. Thanks. See you later. Everything is in order at home. Two telegrams arrived. From your brother? No. Gianni telephoned from London to confirm to Fosca our arrival. It must be from Florence's relatives. -Thanks. -Thanks. -Good Morning. -See you later. Then you will meet my old servant and my father's relatives. Whom I don't even know. Go to the houses? We're here. Look, it's the San Francisco Gate. Volterra. Down to the sea. Look! The Etruscan walls. That's us, Fosca! I'm coming, ma'am. -How are you, Fosca? Sounds nice. -Thanks. -Is everything in order? The house is in order. Only the garden is not prepared. Then I take care of him. This is my husband, Andrew Dawson. - Good night. - Good night. -So you're the Fosca? - Yes sir. -Need help? - It's not necessary, thanks. This way, come in. Did you have a good trip? Very good. Thanks. Madam! I don't know if I did it right. I prepared the guest room. Magn�fico! Excuse me. Can you give this to you? Surely. But first I'm going to take out the luggage. Do you want me to help you? Don't worry. I'll only bring what I need for the next few days. I put the car in the garage and go back. Are you leaving soon? In some days. Mr. Gianni also always stays a few days and leaves. Doesn't like to stay long. Says he comes to Volterra sometimes? Yes sir. Ever. Not Mrs. Sandra. But he, we always see often. Last year it stayed longer, exactly at Easter. Don't talk nonsense. Last Easter, Gianni was sick in London. You didn't come to our wedding. We called him, remember? Truth. In fact, I spoke to him on the phone. But I know it was here at Easter. It arrived on Good Friday and stayed every April. You were here when they sent you to Palagione. Have you been before other times? Before and after. You were telling your husband. Comes very often. Didn't you know? No, I didn't know. They never told me. Sandra, this house is wonderful. I didn't expect it. You have to guide me. like a museum. Forgive me. Forgot it. Tell me what bags you need and I'll get them. Okay, I'm on my way. And the lawyer Gilardini? He sent these flowers, didn't he? He said he didn't want to disturb you because he just got back from a trip. Tomorrow he will see you and report on you. I visited her several times at the clinic. But he's not happy outside the village. Said doctors don't allow it. They treat her very well. There's a private nurse. Fornari's son, who is Dr. Zanutti's assistant, will visit her almost every day. See you almost always. He told me he needed to be at the clinic. But everything is solitude... You can go now, Dark. I prepared this salon, ma'am. You don't want me to stay here to sleep? What if people from Florence arrive? No, no one is coming from Florence. Sandra! Look here! Look! Come here. He used to smile. Enough Please! Stop! Come on, come and sit down. Very well! Want to laugh, Sandra? I missed the opportunity to come here earlier. This is the strangest house I've ever seen. In a sense, it looks like you. No, stop it, please! Everything is fine. I'm not sure it was happy in comparison. But , certainly. So why don't we stay here forever? Well... Yes... Actually... Saw? He was scared. Poor Andrew. It was a comparison, wasn't it? He is sure? What you mean? No apologies. You better shut up. At least I made you laugh. Sorry, dear. Forgive me. It was these telegrams. I don't understand. Better not to talk about it. Why don't we go to the garden? That way we can see how it's arranged. I don't know what we'll see. It's dark outside. We can turn on the stairs lights. There we can see the outside. I'll wear something, okay? As you wish. Not that way. This room has been closed for years. -Why? - It's Mom's room. It's been closed since she got sick. I understand. If you want We can visit the amanh. Of course. Come on, let's go! Sandra, I think I've seen someone. Sorry to disappoint you, but we don't have ghosts here. RAPTURED FROM ITS STUDIES, FROM LIFE AND FROM THEIR LOVED ONE BY THE NAZIST FAIR Sandra... Gianni! Gianni! When did you arrive? Matte knew? Matte is always my accomplice. He knows? They won't come. Who won't come? Dad's brothers and other relatives. They sent telegram from Florence. They're old and tired and they don't want to go out. No, they don't want to come. They don't want to meet with us. It's not Mom's fault they came. Doesn't that seem strange to you? I'm Sandra's brother, Gianni. Much pleasure. Had imagined. I am very happy that you are with us. Did you see? He came! This is the monument, right? Excuse me. I'll come over to read the tombstone. If you don't mind, I'm going home to change. Gianni... I don't want to leave here until we've done everything it's our duty to do. I know you came for this. For my part, I want to clarify the situation to you soon. Here it is. -I don't understand. What are these papers? -See, read. I imagine Fosca already told you that I come here once in a while. Yes, he told me. Surprised me that I didn't know about this before. And your husband? Left him out there. What is your name? Ah yes. Andrew? Your husband is nice. I was just telling Sandra that you're nice. I heard. But it's a little early to say it, don't you think? For me it's like this: immediately or never. And Sandra, is she a good wife? Before, I didn't know how to do anything: messy, lazy. It's true, messy, lazy. Still the same. I thought marriage might have changed her. I hope he warned you about this before he married you. She told me everything. Sure everything? It seems, Gianni! What are these papers? These are the receipts for all the sales I made. I often needed money. With the little I earn and the income Gilardini gives me, I can do little. I don't know if Sandra told you that I chose a difficult and ambitious job, which is very easy to fail. Yes, Sandra tells me you are very interested. Must say I don't do anything. There was a time when it was like that. I would like to be busy with many things and, to have more authority, I have written in certain newspapers unworthy things for a serious chronicler. But I discovered something, which I love to write. So I started writing a book. My editor liked him. S�rio? That's what he said. It's a book of memories. Memories of my teenage years. Are you serious? Go, never believe me. He never trusts his brother. When I get rich and famous, believe me. But this day is no doubt still far away. So when I'm hard I come here to sell or pledge something. Didn't you notice all the silver going down? What are Rafael's paintings missing from the dining room? -But, Gianni... This is all ours, you know? From Sandra and mine. But I couldn't dispose of them before I was of age. I took everything from here, but you will be rewarded. I think you did the right thing. But does Gilardini know this? Certainly. The funny thing is, I thought you knew too. But why did you never say this in your letters? I didn't want you to worry. Tell me something, Andrew. Do you think it's fair for me to live like this? Coming to Mom's house every time I need money? Time to decide, Sandra. Starting tomorrow, the garden will be public, in memory of our father. That way, at least, someone will be able to enjoy it. But what are we going to do with the house? Wait for it to fall? We will not allow another donation. So let's sell this furniture or rent it if selling disgusts you. But do you have a concrete proposal to make? But I wouldn't make a decision without consulting you. I don't want to be busy. Sandra, wait, Sandra. You are angry. If I told you or did something you didn't like, te pe o perd o. First of all, I don't like you stripping in front of me like you're in your bathroom. Very well. Ah, you're right, ma'am! I apologize. I will finish dressing in my room. One minute. And now, lady of the house, don't you offer us anything to drink? There's nothing in the house that I know of. Naturally, Fosca didn't think about it. So let's go to the bar for a drink. Been there? No, I didn't go anywhere. He wants to lock you in a cage, but rebel. Como voc is est pido, Gianni! -You two leave. -Why? Mind if I stay home? I am tired. Why don't we all stay? No, leave. And I'm going to sleep. But how? We haven't seen each other for a century and we have a lot of things to talk about. -And you want to go to sleep! -That's right. I have so many things to say that I'd rather do it tomorrow, take it easy. Please have them send us some bottles here at home. And don't make too much noise when you get back. Are you afraid it will wake you up? N�o, n�o me despertar�. I'll sleep in my old room. Couldn't sleep in the guest room. Over the centuries, the flames razed homes, churches, convents, ancient walls and even the Etruscan cemetery. All attempts to prevent this destruction were futile. Look, that over there in San Giusto. Volterra is the only city condemned to die of an illness like most human beings. No! Be careful! It could fall down there. Look, this is Camaldoli Abbey. The monks abandoned it as it could fall apart. This is a beautiful example of 16th century architecture: the Church of San Giusto. Sorry, the city is beautiful. He's an exceptional guide, but I'm distracted. You know, I love your sister so much. Glad to hear this. Naturally, she told me about you and your family. But for me, Sandra was born the day I met her, in Geneva. She was going to work as a translator in the same place as me. And did it work well? Quite. Nothing out of the ordinary. But he showed great courage during our investigation of Auschwitz with the few survivors, his father's fellow prisoners. Before we started, I thought you knew all about your sister. but while working on this man, a stranger to me, and who hadn't even known her own daughter, I realized that I didn't understand her character and nature. Have you ever been in love? It happens to everyone. So, he must have had this sudden curiosity too, the desire to know everything about the loved one. It's a curiosity that ends quickly. You love a person for what he is, not for what was or will be. I thought so too, and maybe I think tomorrow, but not today. Now I want you to tell me something about your sister, of her life here. Want me to tell you about your first love or loves? You won't think you wanted to ask this. So? What else would it be? Nor do I know. I would like to know about her life here. Remember I'm a foreigner. A city like this is very different from my country. Life in the provinces is the same anywhere, with your unbridled passions that seem impossible when you're far away. But that reappear soon as soon as he returns, even if a hundred years pass. What will you drink? One beer. Goodnight. Welcome! Thanks. How are you? Not bad. I assume that Ms. Sandra is back too. Yes, this is your husband: Andrew Dawson. Much pleasure. Mariella, two beers and send a bottle of whiskey home. Yes sir. Andrew, I'm going to surprise you! You will see your wife's first love in Volterra. Don't look yet. It's our agent's son. A charming guy. For love Sandra studied hard and became a doctor. He is Professor Zanutti's first assistant. -Want to meet him? -Yes, why not? -Same? -Yes! -Look who's here! -Pietro! You look fine. -Come here please. -Sorry. I want to introduce you to Mr. Dawson, Sandra's husband. Good night, nice to meet you. Andrew is the happy mortal who married my sister. By the way, Gianni, and Sandra? Well, we arrived. Lets sit. Leave, leave. I close. - So, good night. -Good night. -See you tomorrow. - At 10, I think. -Yes, at 10 at City Hall. - Do you know where it is? -Yes, I remember that. - Thank you. -You're welcome. -Good night. -Good night. You don't know how happy I am that you came. -Nothing has changed. -You, yes. It's even more beautiful. Thanks. Tomorrow is my father's birthday. We've been waiting for over half an hour. a lot. I'm not promising anything, but I'm going to talk to the mayor and see what he decides. Mr. Mayor, due to your lateness, could we not perform the wedding? I've been waiting since age 10. Sorry. It will only take a few minutes. There she is! You've never seen a wife who waits so long. Mayor, may I introduce my sister. - Good Morning. - Good Morning. -Do you know the Notaviani clerk? -Yes, I know them all. Good Morning. Here is the Act of Giving. Please read it. For his part, Mr. Gilardini gave his consent. -Exactly. -I read it and everything is correct. I'm tired of warming up my husband's seat. Can you know what to plan? What do you expect from me? Why did you come here to humiliate me? Haven't seen you in four years and now you creep here like a snake. Take advantage because I'm sick. But I will tell Antonio that he came to my house to insult me ​​and he will be punished. If you want, we can sign the Act. Your brother told me it's because of you that the garden of your house and the attached land from the morning, be a public park dedicated to the memory of your illustrious father. On behalf of all citizens, I would like to express my deep gratitude for this generous doa o. Are you afraid, ? Your father. Doesn't want to know the truth about his idol. And, without a doubt, You also have Jewish blood in your veins. corrupt as he was. Right, prudent, dirty vices. Secret voids! My brother and I think the best way to express appreciation and esteem for our father It's helping that light be shed on its tragic ending. That's right. Given the circumstances... Mr. Clerk, it seems to me that everything is in order now. Have you been with Mom? We're done, Mr. Mayor. The ceremony is for tomorrow at 10. I'm a terrible speaker and I apologize in advance. But I will do my best. -Thank you. -Thank you. See you later, Mr. Clerk. Very well. I was looking for you. Can I know what's going through your head? You had an obligation to come to me and ask permission. And you know very well that you came here just to try to justify yourself. I asked the doctor to accompany me. Yes, and you've been complaining about how your mother is being treated, even saying that he took her out of the clinic, not for her own good, but for a dirty personal matter. -Nobody said that. -Said yes. Ask her. I don't want to make a scene and I never wanted to. -But now we have to be clear, don't we? - It's exactly what I want. But isn't it better to leave this discussion for later? Gianni is sure. We will speak calmly to your time and place. Let's try to calm down and avoid saying reckless things, which we may soon regret. Let's go! Maybe someone tried to explain but now for me there is no doubt. They were the ones who denounced Dad. I remember when the news of his death came, Mom refused to see Gilardini and so, tried to forget in the arms of new lovers. Here is proof of their responsibility. But he soon married Gilardini. It was after... After... Gilardini knew how to wait. I knew very well that Mom, despite all her attempts, your lovers, your trips and your unexpected returns, he would eventually capitulate. And it happened just like that. Mom got sick and they got married. Gilardini installed himself at home as if he were the owner. He said he had to discipline his family. Worrying about our education. Gianni and I had never been to school. We had an instructor who taught at home. Gilardini decided to send Gianni to a college in Florence. And me, to a college of nuns. He couldn't stand to feel judged by us. Well, it's quite understandable. Gianni soon wrote a letter to Mom saying he'd rather die than go to college. And he took some pills from Veronal. In short, a fake suicide. And I was your accomplice. It's not normal for kids to make up sentimental stories like that. But we don't grow up in a normal environment. You can't imagine how many times Gilardini worried about Gianni's feigned suicide. So far he speaks of him, as of a scandal. Anyway, Gianni got what he wanted. Mom was opposed to your going, so she went to school here in town. We find an evil pleasure in not saying a word in your presence, in never letting us be seen together. We had invented a new game. We had a lot of fun, you know? To communicate, we left messages in secret places that changed every day. Can I show you? Exhibitions. Come. We put it here, in the heater hole. And also inside here, in this Etruscan vase. Maybe it was a little morbid game, no? Why morbid? I don't think so. Where are you going? Come. other times we hide here V�? And here, in Mom's room. In this watch of Love and Psyche. What did you find? A ticket. "Important�ssimo, urgent�ssimo!" "Your faithful slave awaits you "on the tank. "Make sure they don't follow you." It's not so urgent anymore after all these years. All this years? Why? What are you thinking, Andrew? Any. Do you know who was the faithful slave waiting for me in the cistern? It was Pietro. Our agent's son. He was in love with me and Gianni was covering for us. At home, they would never accept such a thing. It would be a scandal. Yes, Gianni told me. What else did he tell you? That the stories of life in the provinces seem incredible when you live far away. But when we returned, after several years, come back to affect you. I don't want this for you, Sandra. Look, it's been 20 years. Anything your mother did, in the state she is in... Besides, I'm not sure it's true. Because what you told me proves absolutely nothing. Your hostility to Gilardini and the suspicion that every boy feels for his stepfather or stepmother It's nothing out of the ordinary. Sandra, my love, I want to get you out of this town soon. You are jealous of the ghosts that roam this house. Yes, I'm jealous, I feel like there's something strange here, a force that's trying to tear us apart and i'm scared. But I love you. You know I love you. Sandra? Matte, the lady is resting, don't bother her. - I am going out. - Allright Sir. Gianni? Gianni! Gianni. Waves est voc ? I'm here. It kept me waiting. Are you sure no one followed you? N�o. But I warn you, Gianni. Andrew found the note. Paci�ncia. Why did you make me come here? searched a test. Do you have something to tell me? Many things! I wanted to say them last night, before I went to your room. It was you! Sim. Locked the key to defend yourself against your husband? Poor thing. I thought I was happy with him. But I am happy with it. Let's go home. We can talk there. This is our home. Era. Not anymore. What do you want? Borrow me? Just for one day. N�o! You're crazy! You're crazy, crazy, crazy! Give me! Let's go! Please! Just for tonight. It's no game! It's an unconscious. If you had stayed with me this morning... Two monsters, two monsters, are my children. Yes, my children... He always hid there, behind the door. What do you want to know about me? I want to know if my kids are two monsters: my enemies. Please. Don't say that. I would hate you. Remember the first time we were down here? The wind closed the door and you started to cry with fear. I thought no one would come to set us free. So you worried about me. I still worry, Sandra, I swear it. - Check in Mom's room. - What's up? My novel. Read it and understand everything. Don't believe me? I say you will understand everything. You'll understand why I don't want you to tell me who saw it this morning. I know, but I don't want to talk about it. Sandra, these are things I got rid of forever. I don't like getting involved in subjects that don't interest you but you seem like such a serious and intelligent person. In short, Mr Dawson. I came looking for you because I would like to ask you a favor. I would like to give you all the related documents administra o do patrim nio de Gianni and Sandra. Please tell them I have no intentions of continuing to look after your interests. I don't ever want to see them again. I'm sorry, but... Mr. Gilardini, he hinted that he was coming to the Palace with the clerk. I think it's best to talk straight to Gianni and Sandra. No! I will not set foot in the Palace! You have no idea what I did for these two young men and their mother! Miracles! If not for me, the estate would have gone up in smoke. On the contrary, you are safe and sound. And what would happen to this poor woman, your mother, if I didn't take care of her? And I will continue all my life. And let it be clear, I, with my poor means and without anyone's help. I think you should talk to Sandra and Gianni. There are many misunderstandings. Misunderstood? Call it misunderstandings? You're kidding. You think I don't understand your insinuations? Please, Mr. Gilardini. It's their bad upbringing, no doubt about it. And I was wrong to give in when you shouldn't. I know what you mean. Sandra told me everything. - Oh, yeah? - Yes. He told me about Gianni's difficult adolescence. The fake suicide, to get your mother's attention; your anxieties. These are common things at that age. Not so much. I believe. Sandra also told me about her romance with the agent's son. Dr. Formari. Water under the bridge. Poor Dr. Formari! Dear Mr. Dawson, more than love for Sandra, Dr. Formari had a real veneration for her. It was understandable because Sandra at 16 was as beautiful as she is today. And from a higher social class. I understand that Sandra's mother didn't look kindly on that friendship. And small town gossip, as it always happens. Please, it wasn't these evils that upset my wife's family. There were other reasons. Which? Can tell me? And then? Nothing to say? Is it so dirty what I wrote? It doesn't look so bad to me, but I could be wrong. Did you let anyone else read this horror? My editor. When it's published... It will not be published. But why? Are you taking it personally, by any chance? Think. That's what I wrote for the novel, a work of fiction. No one will think it's a fiction. Who? You mean, these lazybones here? Are they the ones we have to worry about? According to you, we should be ashamed and hide for something we didn't do. You're a petite bourgeois, Sandra. But I don't, I don't care what anyone else thinks. Since they just want to criticize what I do, I'm going to scandalize them. I want to see your faces when they read: "My desire grew more and more instead of calming down. "I lay on my sister's compliant body "as if it were from an enemy I had to defeat, "without ever being satisfied with the feat." Well written, huh? Stop! You're worse than them! How much do you want to destroy all this? How much? This is priceless. According to you, you should sacrifice not just money but success. Judging by your reaction, makes me think my soap opera could be the start of a successful career. So how much do you want? I want you to tell me something. Why do you want to destroy my book? Your book could become a weapon in the hands of our enemies. Is that why? And also for that. Why have you avoided me all these years? you didn't even come to my wedding and I, in turn, came here. Look, Sandra. A strange thing happened when I learned of your wedding. A malaise, a kind of convulsive crisis worthy of a romantic hero. Do you know if I had it when I was a kid? Nobody here could tell me. I was afraid of this strange evil and took refuge here. It's been several years since we parted. In that period, I had rarely thought about you, in our teens. The change was so unforeseen, as to erase the past altogether. I wanted to see everything, to know everything, to travel, to fall in love. And, in fact, I fell in love a few times. So many times, it doesn't matter. This I understood the day you wrote to say you were getting married. All at once, I remembered everything. Our silences, our conversations. My anguish, my anxiety. Our walks on the terrace, the sleepless nights. And above all how happy I was when I was with you! A feeling I had experienced as a boy, at the age when you shouldn't know your passions. Only you can understand me, only you can help me even though I'm afraid of loneliness and the unforeseen return of a memory, of the sound of a voice, of a color. I wanted to save all these impressions in a fable. But the boy who felt the same passion as adults became an adult unable to find the innocence of another time. I can't help you. I ask you. Stay with me for a while longer. I can't! Sabe, Gianni, in the middle of mom's letters, I found one from when I was a kid. You were eight or nine years old. Mom had gone: a concert. You said: "Dear mom, "I'm glad you got to Vienna well. "Sandra and I did our duties. "I couldn't sail on the boat you gave me. "I'm very busy "in my little garden." When Mom got back from Vienna, brought many gifts. - Remember? - Yes. Sim. Andrew. Andrew! I wanted to say that I invited Mr. Gilardini and Dr. Formari for dinner tonight at eight. Try to behave as best you can. Basically, your husband did well to invite Gilardini. It will be a night of general peace. Sandra, be nice to him. It will be a peace of mind for everyone. Forgive me for the lighting, but I did the best I could. Sandra. Do you want something to drink? Always better than neon, damn neon. Is it also widespread in America? In offices and bars, yes. But in elegant places it is fashionable to light with candles. I understand. Did you know that light intensity has certain clinical effects? I was told that red, for example, has an aphrodisiac effect. No, I didn't know. Good night, Sandra. Sorry, I can't stay. I'm on duty at the hospital tonight and I'm late. No, wait, you should at least eat something first. Ask him, Sandra. You can't say no to Sandra. No doubt I must say no to her too. This is the end of the world! Doesn't love you anymore. - You should protest. -It seems bad not to accept your invitation. Never mind, Pietro, let him say what he wants. Goodnight. How are you? Goodnight. Honey, what is it? Any. It's my fault. You're mad at me. You think I'm the worst writer alive. I was wrong to make you read my book. However, they say it's not so bad. Tonight, I was happy because I had found what I needed. The title. "Ursa Star Vacancies". from Leopardi. Do you know him? N�o. Sure! I've been waiting. "Ursa star vacancies, "I didn't think about looking at them again "about the sparkling paternal garden to talk to you about the window of this house, "where I lived my childhood "and where, at last, all my enjoyments ended." - Mr. Gilardini is here. - It's fine. Send him in. Goodnight. - Good night, Mr. Gilardini. - Good night, Mr. Dawson. Please. I was so worried about you, Sandra, who had sworn not to step back in this house. As you see, I confess to you sincerely. But your husband was so understanding and generous, insisted so much... Let's try to make peace for the good of all, shall we? - Oh, Gianni. - Oi. I would like a drink? Yes please. Sorry Sandra, but I have to go. It's too late. You are so graceful, Pietro. It will never change. Let him go if he wants to. See? She defends you like when we were children. Sandra, I invited the doctor to come over for dinner. Today I had a long conversation with Mr... - Gilardini. - Forgive me, Mr. Gilardini. - Water? - Yes please. Mr. Gilardini is not opposed to his mother returning to the clinic if they think it will be better there. I spoke to Pietro about this this morning. We all know your opinion. You think I catechized him. Sorry, Mr. Gilardini, I prefer to explain it myself. I told you what I thought and I have nothing to disprove. I also made you note that your mother has amenities in your village which, without a doubt, in the clinic there isn't. Look, Sandra, I proposed a type of treatment, in your mother's therapy. based on my knowledge of her. It's a normal scientific theory. Mr. Gilardini agrees to do some experiments, after seeing the result achieved by visiting it this morning. Sim. Your mother did nothing but repeat to the nurse all day that I wanted to go to the ceremony tomorrow. So I got it. I know that after a few minutes, he forgot everything. - And this time, the Doctor was there. - Yes. Aren't you really thinking about taking Mom to the ceremony tomorrow? I know very well that nothing will happen because, surely, to stupid painkillers. What you mean? Speak clearly. Exactly what I said. Please, Sandra. If we are meeting here to reach an agreement, not to come and discuss. But what deal? You heard her. I know you very well. I know you're plotting in that hostile, merciless mind. What is the use of seeking an agreement? - Isn't it clear? - Yes of course. If someone tries to be clear, help you, you turn around and become evasive, intractable, aggressive! Sr. Gilardini. But what is this truth you want to discover? I only know one and that's the one you want to remain hidden. But do you realize what you want? Only now did I realize it. Please calm down. She is willing to accuse her mother, me, her stepfather, of something horrible to maintain your innocence, to hide the crap we've been trying to hide for years, like cats that bury their droppings. But no, I leave you with your garbage and stop. Mr. Gilardini, please. Please. Wait. Listen, it can't go out like this. It has to be clear, because I want to know what you mean. Yes, yes, speak!
