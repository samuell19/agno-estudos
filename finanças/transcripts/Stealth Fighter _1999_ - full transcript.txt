Come on, take him down! Take him down! You got him. Come on. Let's go. I got five bucks on this. Go. Go, go, go, go. You're mine, Mitchell. I'm going to break your arm like a twig. Careful you don't get blood all over your new shiny shoes. The word is you made it into deep sleep. The word is you didn't. I saw the scores... You know, the stats. I deserve that assignment. There's an opening at Thackett transport. You ain't worth my backwash, Mitchell. We both know who's the better pilot. Do me a favor, Turner, will you? Learn to accept defeat gracefully. Come on, Mitchell, this guy ain't shit. Bring him on down. Men on board, this is command. All men on flight deck. On-time is 0100. You're a real piece of work, you know that, Turner? No, I'm just a closer. That's your problem... You can't finish a man's job. Port evac, this is Phantom Leader... Flight's up. Roger. Have a good flight, Phantom Leader. Phantom Leader, continue vector 0-7-niner. Roger. Holding 7-0-niner, 700 knots. I don't know, Lieutenant. Seems like a waste to me. I mean, bombing cocaine fields, for what? Save a couple of addicts from killing themselves? Haven't you heard about the war on drugs? The fields are a decoy. We stray a little off course. Whoops. We lose a few bombs over his head, then it's the power plant and ammunitions depot. You're kidding, right? You're not. Don't worry about it, kid. We're just carrying out some orders that no one's ever going to admit were sanctioned. Hey, Mitchell, how's your arm? Hope it's not the one you jack off with. What do I need to jerk off for when I got you around? In your dreams. How's your girl by the way? That sexy thing. She still yelling out my name when you do it? Only when I'm doing it wrong. All right, ladies, the pajama party's over. You got a job to do. Do it. Roger, Quarterback. We're coasting. Jungle in sight. Okay, we're taking ground fire. Going into the weeds. Active on ECM. Roger. Jamming radar frequencies. Quarterback, this is Phantom Leader. I got target in sight. I'm in hot. The neighbors are knocking on the door. Drop 2-0 degrees. There you go. Easy. Easy. Fire. New vector heading 1-4-7. Secondary target ahead. Copy that, Phantom One. I'm right with you. Okay, I'm taking heavy flak. Phantom 2, we got two SAMs incoming. 1:00 low, 200 feet. I see them. Closing fast! 0-9-0, 20 miles. Hell, there's more. We got two coming on our 4:00 load! Break right. Hard right! They're closing in, 12:00. Shit, that was close. Four more coming! We're locked! I don't see them. I don't see them! Shit. Two, we coming up to six, Phantom Two. On my count, drop your flares. Hit jab and break right. Three, two, one, break! Good job, Turner. Maintain heading, I'll switch. One more has still got it. Contact, 20 left. Bug out! Bug out! Go high! What in the hell? No offense. Shit, man, I'm hit. I'm hit! Mason bought it. My instruments are fried. I'm dead in the air. Get the hell out of there, Turner. Eject. Eject. I can't, it's stuck. It won't open, man. I'm going in. What the hell are you doing, Johnny? You've dropped ordnance. Get back in formation now. Son of a bitch. Man, we've been hit. We've been hit. We're losing power, Quarterback. We're losing power! Accelerating 1,000 feet, 100 knots. Phantom One, come in. Phantom One. I repeat, Phantom One, come in, please. Come in! Come on, baby, fire up. Fire up! Come on, baby. We got restart. We got restart! Hudson, check ordnance, and Mike... Mike? Mike? Goddamn it. This is Phantom Leader. Phantom Two is splashed. Hudson's dead. Kelly, this is Peterson. Get those men out of there now. Aye, skipper. Abort the mission, Phantom One. I repeat, abort the mission. Say again, Quarterback. You're breaking up. Can't make out. I said, abort, Phantom Leader. Abort. Abort mission... Damn. Quarterback, this is Phantom Leader reporting in. Mission completed. Dirty up, Phantom One. Roger. Gear is down. Line up. Fly the needles. Roger that. Call the blow. Phantom Leader, debriefing in ten minutes. Commander Peterson's office. Good luck. Roger. What the goddamn hell were you thinking out there today, Mitchell? You disobeyed my direct order. Now, do you have anything to say for yourself? Sir, the message was garbled. Don't bullshit me, Lieutenant! You're a wild card, and I'm tired of covering for your heroic antics. Those planes belong to the taxpayers and not Ryan "Iron Man" Mitchell. Sir, I had a situation out there. I did it for... I know why you did it. I have to give this bullshit speech. It's required by law. Off the record, I'd just like to say I think you did a hell of a job out there today. I lost my team, sir. Well, casualties are the price of war. With all due respect, sir, we're not at war, are we? There something on your mind? Are we still off the record? If that's how you want it. I was just wondering if the cost outweighed the results. We lost three really good men out there today. They were friends of mine. You also eliminated an enemy power plant munitions dump, To say nothing of the cocaine plantation. Ron and Nancy are going to be very proud of you. Yes, sir. You're not having a crisis of conscience, are you, son? No, sir. That's good, because there's no room for that in one of Uncle Sam's aircraft. They're not designed for them. You fly where you're told to fly and drop what you're told to drop and leave the politicking to the wizards in Washington. Yes, sir. Good. Because I've got enough to deal with right here. Turner dropped his ordnance and played havoc with some friendly territory and I've got to explain that to the commander-in-chief, and he is not going to be pleased. Now... Why don't you move on to your official debriefing? I've got some tap dancing to do. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Shit. Crypt Keeper, this is Phantom Pharaoh. I have the bird. Repeat, I have the bird. Roger that. Good job. And what about the men? That's a negative. They didn't make it. It doesn't sound right, boss. These guys were pros, man. I trained with them in Colombia. That's not important. We have the airplane. That's what matters. Reprogram Thanatos. Acquire and activate secondary target. Let me know when it's done. Yes, sir. Slow ten knots. Left full rudder. Reduce speed ten knots. Aye, aye, sir. Left full rudder. Steady as she goes. Lieutenant Elias, let's hold to our original course, heading 2-8-0. Aye, aye, skipper. Holding 2-8-0. She's running quiet, sir. What the hell is that? Sounds like it's coming from the engine room, skipper. I'll go check it out. Captain, we're sinking fast! Dropping 5-3-5 meters, sir. Secure the ordnance. Get that man to sickbay. Passing 400 meters, sir. Engine room, damage control report. Don't have one yet, sir. Reactor damage. I'm still working on it. Everything's down. Take a coolant sample. Status! Estimate bottoming out in 2-5 meters. Captain, brace for impact! Pump all auxiliaries to sea. Contact fleet control! Issue mayday alert! You heard him, sailor! Do it! Damn it. Forward to starboard! Helm to starboard! You mean to tell me someone just walked in, took a $2.2 billion stealth right out from under our noses? Apparently so, Mr. President. The dead commandos were mercenaries, but we don't know who sent them. Authorities at the base claim their radar and surveillance systems just shut down... Everything went dark. Christ. It gets worse. We've lost track of the U.S.S. Normandy somewhere off the coast of south Africa. Lost track? It's one of our newest Los Angeles-class nuclear attack submarines, sir. There's a crew of 141 men aboard that ship. How do you lose a goddamn nuclear submarine? I have an idea, Mr. President. Let's just pray I'm wrong. Come on. He will see you now. Tell him I'll be there in a minute. Now. So aggressive. Let me ask you something, honey. You ever thought about trying a real man? I have a real man... My husband. Your boss. I got news for you, lady. Nobody owns me. I'm strictly freelance. If you say so. If Roberto saw you do that, you would be dead. Yeah, that may be true, but tell me you didn't like that just a little. I didn't. Control, I'm on approach. Roger that, Eagle one. Vector off of 1-8-0 and switch over to tower frequency. Roger. Switching to ground control. What do you say we hit the club afterwards? Celebrate that transfer of yours with a couple of brewskies? That's a big negative, tower. I'm out of here, good buddy. I've got my kid today. Roger that. Continue your descent. 3-5-0. Clear to land on runway 2-5. Roger, control. All right, gentlemen, enough. Needless to say, this meeting is not being recorded. Talk to me, Harry. And keep it simple. Satcom reports a few reconnaissance satellites went dark during the night. A few? How many? Seven. Can anyone explain this to me, gentlemen? Sir, I just got off the phone with Air Force control. My hunch was right. We have an activated war satellite, and we didn't activate it. What? Yesterday at approximately 2200 hours, the national reconnaissance office reported activity from a satellite known as "Thanatos," here, over the Philippines. That's the same time the stealth was stolen. Precisely. Now, NORAD couldn't confirm this. They had their trackers working around the clock. You see, Mr. President, Thanatos has been non-operational since 1984. Wait, wait. Are you trying to tell me that this satellite is a relic of the Star Wars project? Sir, Thanatos is the Star Wars project. It was supposed to be the ultimate weapon, our last line of defense. It fires an electromagnetic pulse which debilitates any electrical systems that the beam strikes. It was designed to knock out guidance systems on enemy ICBMs And now it's in enemy hands? It appears so, sir. She came online again at 0700 over the Atlantic. Don't tell me. At the same time the Normandy was lost. You got it, sir. All right, what we do about the sub? The Normandy's last known position was off the coast of Cape Town. We've had nothing since. Was it sunk? Well, we don't know that yet, Mr. President. There's another satellite entering orbital visual range in three hours. Okay. Suppose they're still alive. How much time do they have without power? If they're on rock bottom, assuming the bulkhead holds? Four days, sir. Maybe more, maybe less. Okay. Send out search and rescue. They're prepping for the mission now. Good. Now, what about the stealth? Mr. President, I believe if we I.D. whoever activated Thanatos, we'll find the stealth. We'll find her. Good God. I trust your bank in Paraguay received my wire. Everything was in order. I have another job for you. Good. Wire my account in Geneva. As you wish. Your next assignment, Mr. Turner. Those are the coordinates. You will do me a great service by eliminating that, inconvenience. Another arms dealer? Let's just say, to plant a fruitful garden, one must pick the weeds along the way. What about that submarine? Insurance. Anything? No, sir. Engineer said everything just shut down. The power's been spiked. How are we doing on oxygen? Well, we've got 39 hours of pure in storage. All right, wait as long as possible before you start the scrubbers. Aye, aye, skipper. The reactor? It's scrap, skipper. Carry on, Lieutenant. Aye, aye, sir. In the past, you've dealt with my competition, and they offer an inferior product. But with me, Andres Solymosi, you only get the best. I will not be undersold. Come, come, come, come. I assure you, gentlemen, you'll not be disappointed. When you do business with Andres Solymosi, you receive nothing less than perfection. Voilà. The avant-garde in modern state-of-the-art weaponry. This is the very best the market has to offer. And here. American satellite I.C. board. With encryption equipment, yes? Hello? Hello. Where's my little girl? Hiya, Daddy. Hiya, squirt. You ready? Almost. Almost? I'm on the phone with Kenny; I'll be through in a minute. Hang on, Kenny. Who's Kenny? My boyfriend, Dad. I'll be right back. Your boyfriend? Maybe if you came by more often, you'd know what's going on around here. Hi. You said you were going to call before you came over. I forgot. Things have been kind of crazy over at the base. I'm sorry. Erin, can we talk? No, I don't think so. That's really not a good idea. J.P. Will be down in a minute. Five minutes? Three? All right. Three. So how's the hospital? Exhausting, long hours. How's your apartment? Small, empty. The lease is up next week. Do you want some ice tea or something? Ryan, please don't. I miss you. I miss my family. I want to come home. Do you ever stop to think about what I want? You're right. I'm sorry. What do you want? I'll do whatever it takes. What do I want? I want to feel safe. I don't want to have to wonder every day whether you're going to come home alive or not. I put in for a transfer. Do you know that I had a meeting with J.P.'s principal last week? Your daughter is telling fairy tales about her father, that he's some big hero. And get this... Personal friends with the president. How about that? You applied for a transfer? It's already been approved. I've flown my last mission. I'll be piloting a nice, quiet desk for the next few years. Erin, I love you and J.P. more than anything else in this world. Give me another shot, please. God, I don't know. Will you at least think about it? This Thursday is Parents' Day at J.P.'s school. I'll be there. I'm ready, Dad! Okay, let's go. So where are you guys off to today? Dad's taking me flying. Flying? No, no, no. No, you're not going flying. Come on, Ma. It'll be safe. You are absolutely not getting on a plane, young lady. Do you understand me? My God! That was good, Dad. Not exactly Magic Mountain, but good. Yeah? Well, hold on. No, no. No, Dad. Don't do it! Don't do it! So, tell me about this Kenny. He's a real babe, Dad. A real babe? You going to marry the guy? Get real, Dad, please. What about your mom? She seeing anybody? Dad, you don't want to go there, really. No, seriously, is she? Okay, let's see. First, there's the mailman. The mailman, is it? And lately, she's been eyeing the pool guy. The pool guy. Really. Yep. And let's see. There's more? Yeah, lots. Lots? Dad, I was only kidding! I swear! No! Don't do it! I told you not to do it! Dad? God, God. My God! Dad, I'm going to ralph! Dad! Dad! Dad! You're not going to do it! I'm going to lose my pizza! Dad! Dad, I swear, I'm going to get you for that one! Okay, okay, that was better than Magic Mountain. Matter of fact, that was so good, I don't even want to do it again. Yeah, I couldn't think of a better compliment. Dad, can I ask you a question? Shoot. You going to work it out with Mom? I'm trying to, but I kind of blew it. I took you guys for granted, and your mom doesn't trust me anymore. I kept thinking there was always tomorrow to spend with you guys, but she got tired of waiting for tomorrow. I believe you can be rehabilitated, and I want you to come home. Believe me, sweetheart, I want to come home, too. There's a precise pattern at work here. Satellites that went dark over vital orbiting positions over China, Russia North Korea, the Middle East. Whoever spiked it is one clever son of a bitch. That would leave us openly susceptible to an attack. That's correct. How soon can we send up replacements? Within a week. The problem is placing the birds without attracting worldwide attention. We're going to mask them with two shuttle missions. Well, what can you tell us, General? Mr. President, Thanatos presents us with an interesting predicament. When activated, the beam shuts down anything electronic in its path, including radio communications, positioning systems, et cetera. Can we launch an ICBM and destroy the damn thing? Thanatos orbits 23,000 miles above the earth. She's capable of detecting and tracking thousands of missiles while simultaneously reprogramming to attack mode. Besides, you can't hit what you can't see. What do you mean by that, General? Well, sir, Thanatos was designed to be invisible to enemy radar. Her outer surfaces are smooth with curved contours, not unlike the stealth. These design strategies allow her to orbit without being detected. So what do you recommend we do, general? Well, I've got my men trying to track down the source of the computer transmission. If we can trace it we can try to download a virus into the signal, and disorient the bird. Mr. President? Yes? Communications just picked up a live transmission from Angola, sir. Transferring direct. Relay hook-up in about ten seconds. Good afternoon, Mr. President. I trust you are well. Roberto Menendez. Get to the point. I have Thanatos, and I have the stealth. I also have a list of 1,400 political prisoners being held captive around the world. Friends of mine. I want you to release the ones being held on American soil, and I want you to prevail on the various other governments of the world to do the same. A list is being faxed to you as we speak. You have 48 hours. No intrigues, no delays, no negotiations. If Thanatos receives any commands without my frequency codes, she will automatically go into attack mode and fire at preprogrammed targets. So hack away, gentlemen, at your own risk. We don't negotiate with terrorists. Yes, of course. I forgot who I was talking to. Well, then, I guess I'll just have to erase civilization as you know it... Bank records, lines of communication, missile codes. You name it, Thanatos will obliterate it. Yes, one more thing, Mr. President... You still have time to save that submarine of yours. Goodbye. Anybody want to tell me about this lunatic? He's Roberto Menendez, sir. Nicaraguan, arms dealer, currently resides in Angola. We cut him off, sir. In 1984, the congressional ban on funding prohibited all military support of the contras. So we let him out to dry, and now he's got a vendetta. We know where he is. Why don't we go in and flatten his base? It's not going to be that easy, sir. If you do a bombing run and you fail to take out the computer, there's going to be hell to pay. We don't even have current recon shots of the area. We do have a satellite over Angola, but it's been disabled. Why don't we go in using our latest recon photos? Sir, this could prove to be a political embarrassment. Menendez has funneled millions of dollars into your campaign coffers over the years. This is great. Maybe we should consider giving him what he wants. What the hell are you talking about? We can't do that and disregard our policy about negotiating with terrorists. Come on, it won't stop there. It's just the beginning. Anybody else got any ideas? Mr. President. I recommend a covert insurgency. We send in a team of rangers with a stealth pilot in tow. We either steal that plane back, or we blow it up where it sits. And disable the computer that controls the satellite, but we got to do it fast before Menendez can retaliate. No. Menendez said he'd use Thanatos if we try anything like that. With all due respect, sir, he's going to use Thanatos whether we try to do something or not. If we strike quickly enough, our teams can get in there and deactivate the satellite before he does any more damage. And I've got just the man for the job. Man. Suddenly, I don't feel so good. When can we go again, Daddy? We'll see, baby. Just let me tie her down and we'll get some chow, okay? Right on. Look, Daddy. It's the men in black. Colonel Mitchell? Yes. We need to speak with you, sir. Bye, Daddy. I love you. I love you too, sugar pie. Take care, okay? I have to go to Washington. It's important. Honest. I'll be back on Parents' Day, Thursday. I hope you're not expecting us to bake a cake in your honor. I'll be here for sure, okay? I'll light a candle in the window. Hey, Dad! Remember, Thursday's pool cleaning day, too. I'll be there. That's a promise. You want to see me? Yes, Mr. Turner. Come. I have a job for you. It's very important to me. Two million. You're getting ideas, Mr. Turner. Let's just say I've been thinking. You want me to fly, I need a raise. Be careful, my friend. Men who think too much have a tendency to disappear. Look at me, Roberto. I'm shaking in my boots. Now, do you want me to fly or should I start looking for another employer? If you can find another employer with a stolen stealth fighter in his garage, be my guest. That's not the only plane I fly. Plus, you got to find yourself another jockey. Your boy Burke couldn't find his ass with two hands and a flashlight. Yo, dog. I'll take that flashlight and shove it down your throat. Very well, Mr. Turner. $2 million. But don't get too greedy. I've grown fond of our acquaintance. I'll try to keep that in mind. Who's the mark? An associate of mine... Mr. Piatigorski. I heard he's about to do business with Pakistan. Just wire the money to my account in Argentina. Just how many accounts do you have? Not enough. Here are the coordinates. Tomorrow morning, Thailand. The missile convoy and the village by the river. I want you to take them both out. It's a done deal. Make sure you take care of business, because if you don't, I swear to God, it'll be your last job. A toast, then. Graduated Annapolis, top of his class. Seal team six, flight school. This man's a one of a kind, Mr. President. He's a bit of a renegade, but he always completes his mission. What's "Deep Sleep"? That's a code name for top secret training at Nellis. Select intrepid stealth pilots. Best sticks we've got. Come in. Mr. President. Stand down, colonel. Have you been briefed on the situation? Yes, sir. I understand you recently requested reassignment. Yes, sir. I put in for a desk job. Colonel, if you feel hesitant in any way about accepting this mission, feel free to discuss it with us. Mr. President, I'm here to do my duty to God and country. Good man. Admiral Peterson hand-picked you for this mission. You have a remarkable history. He says you're a remarkable man. Thank you, sir. We need someone who can not only fly the stealth, but who can handle himself in case things get rough on the ground. We've put together a squad of the very best operatives special forces has to offer. They're committed to getting you in, no matter what. Any questions? When do we leave? Good man. Black Raven, this is tower. Signal is go. Repeat, the signal is go. Roger that, tower. See you on the other side. All right, listen up. The second we hit the beach we go into diversion op. Just snake the compound. Hit them with the store. I'll drop a poison pill in the computer. You, make like hell for the hanger, you got that? Affirmative. Callenger and Stevens, they got your back. Take this. If you can't get that sucker off the ground, leave it there. Understood. GPS homing device, just in case you get lost. You sure you can pull this off? You just get me in. I'll either fly that baby out of there or make sure she never flies again. Game time, colonel. Let's go. Status report. The scrubbers are beginning to fail. We're starting to breathe carbon monoxide. Where's my first? Sonar. Trying communications. Carry on. Anything? Not a word, skipper. Keep trying. Elias, report. Skipper, the engine room's got pressure leakage and the valves are cracking. Get the hell out of there, Elias, right now! Aye, aye, skipper. Let's go. Evacuate. Evacuate. Get the hell out of here. This room is finished. Let's go. Sylvia, eres mas bella que la luna. Flattery will get you everywhere, Roberto. Tell me, what do you think of this Owen Turner? He's a lonely, pathetic fish who waits only for you to feed him. He cares about nothing but money, my love. I know. I like that about him. His mind isn't cluttered with politics. I know exactly what he wants. I don't trust him. How dare you. Thought you'd want to know. Getting a call on the scrambler. 777. They're calling your bluff. What? A counteroffensive has been launched. When? Commandos should be hitting your beach in approximately ten minutes. Ten minutes? Alert the men. We have some unexpected guests. I want you to make them feel unwelcome. Right. Turner. What took your man so long to call us? Maybe he's just developing a sense of humor. Mr. President, choppers are in the vicinity of the last contact with the U.S.S. Normandy, and magnetic anomaly detectors are in the water, sir. We're going to find her. What's the status of Black Raven? Incursion underway. They should be hitting the beach... Right about now. All right, everyone move out. All right, Mitchell, you know what to do. And if you got to blow it up, be out of there by 0700. Otherwise, you become a native. If anything screws up, you know where to meet us. I know. By the old mill stream. All right, let's move out. I can't make anything out down there, but your boys are going to need all the luck they can get. Bingo. Alpha One, this is Iron Man. Do you copy? This is Alpha One. Go ahead, Iron Man. I've got the birdcage in sight. It's a piece of cake. All right, give me a minute. I'll light the candles. Alpha seven, this is alpha one. C.Q. Yeah. Roger, Alpha One. This is Alpha Seven. C.Q. We're holding position. Alpha One, this is Iron Man. Do you copy? Roger that. Go ahead. We're ready to rumble. All right. All Alphas go on my signal. Alpha team, move out. You take the head. You take the tail. I'm going straight down the middle. Go. Come on! Son of a bitch. It's Mitchell. What is it? They sent an old buddy of mine up here to kill me. That's going to make this all the more interesting. I've been waiting a long time to deal that hot shot some payback. Secure the perimeter. Let's find that computer. It's too quiet. I've got a bad feeling about this. Stay down. Gotcha. You all right? That ain't too bad. Mitchell. Look at you, you fucking amateur. What happened out here? Where's the rest? They're dead. They knew we were coming. It was a setup. We didn't have a chance. Same on my end. So much for diversion ops. Well, listen, friend, these were my men. Somebody's going to pay. You can count on it. The question is who? I don't know. But I'm going to find out. They're getting closer. Can you make it to the beach? You want to race? I'm not going. What do you mean you're not going? I've got a plane to catch. See you. Good luck. Come on. No Mitchell. He's probably dead. No. He's out there. He's dangerous, and he knows his shit. I don't trust this guy. If Mitchell isn't a corpse, he's long gone. Well, then find him and kill him. Yes, sir. I was just starting to like that guy. Yes. Gentlemen, Black Raven was a disaster. Prepare the bombing run. Here are the coordinates for the sub. Excelente. It's time to show the president he can no longer betray us. Did you find Mitchell? Obviously not. He's still alive. You overestimate him, and you underestimate me. Son, I deal with death every day, and I never underestimate my opponent. Keep looking, Burke. Mr. Turner, I trust you'll be on your way soon. Hey, baby, you keep it warm for me till I get back. You know how I get after these missions. You are a pig. Torpedo ready? Good. Intercept, this is Iron Man. Do you copy? Iron Man, this is Kelly at intercept. We copy. Well, the stealth just took off. I couldn't stop her. Should I scrub the mission? Copy. That's a negative. Hold your position until further ordered. I have a positive ID on the stealth pilot. His name is Owen Turner. I repeat, Owen Turner. Copy. I thought he was dead, Iron Man. Beats the hell out of me. But he's alive and well and working for the bad guys. You better let the admiral know. Copy that. I'm out. I canceled your morning press conference and cleared your schedule, Mr. President. Tell me about Owen Turner. He was an ace pilot, perfect scores. Passed over for Deep Sleep because he failed the psych evaluations. Temperamental. The navy listed him as a risk. His plane went down not soon afterwards during operations in Nicaragua that he was flying with Mitchell. Mitchell and Turner know each other? Yes, sir. They flew together for six years. Seems they were big rivals. Turner was listed as a killed-in-action. No body was ever found. The plane practically disintegrated in mid-air. Yes. Mr. President, we've located the Normandy. The deep submersibles are on the way. Good, good. Keep me posted. They found the submarine, Harry. Skipper, the engine room is flooded. The coolant samples and radiation measures still come up negative. Good. Thank you, Phillips. Captain, we've got contact. I'll be damned. They're coming to tow us out of here. Prepare the crew, lieutenant. Let's go. Attention, all hands. This is Captain Thompson. Pack your toothbrushes, gentlemen. We are going home. Sir, at 350 feet. 340. Sir, something strange on sonar. Incoming. Yes. It's the Normandy, sir. She's been torpedoed. No survivors. The rescue divers went down with her. Any word from Mitchell? Not after his message about Turner. He'll break radio silence when he needs to. We've got a carrier within range to intercept, advise, and instruct. In 30 minutes, Thanatos will be over American airspace again, sir. With Ramsey and his team eliminated, Mitchell's going to have to disarm Thanatos himself. Listen, if Mitchell hasn't taken out that computer in 25 minutes, I want that compound vaporized. What about Menendez? I want him dead. I want the whole damn operation annihilated. Send in a complete strike force. Hit that son of a bitch with everything we got. Are you sure you want to do this, Mr. President? You damn right, I do. What about Congress? What if the press get wind that he was one of our... God damn them all, Harry! Just do it anyway. What about Mitchell? When he checks in, brief him on the plan. He's got 25 minutes before we flatten everything around him. It's the best I can do. Yes, sir. Have her refueled and ready to go. The satellite feed's ready, sir. Start programming the light transmission sequences. Yes, sir. Mr. Turner, welcome back. Well done. He's calling on the uplink, sir. Good. I want to talk to that son of a bitch myself. He'll be coming up momentarily. Good morning, Mr. President. I'm in no mood for pleasantries, Menendez. Your voice is filled with urgency. That's ironic. You were not in any rush to get me those F-16s I purchased ten years ago. In fact, the last time your country was in such a rush, you left me and my men stranded in Nicaragua. You son of a bitch. You killed 141 of my men. You're going to pay. I told you not to try anything. You invaded my compound. You caused their deaths. Menendez, you are a dead man. You got that? News flash, Mr. President. In exactly one hour, Thanatos will be over Atlanta's Hartfield International Airport. One of the busiest, as you know. Think of all those airplanes dropping like flies out of the sky. New deal. You in? Yeah. Damn! Such a waste! Okay, Mr. President, we got a new deal on the table. You will wire $10 billion to my account in the Bahamas. That's billion with a B. I'll fax you the information. You can burn that little list of psychopaths that Menendez told you to set free. Fuck them. Fuck politics. Fuck you. Just don't fuck with me. You fuck with me, I'm going to climb in that stealth bomber and start dropping bombs all over cities in the United States. Those nukes we got earmarked for Moscow will look just as pretty dropping on Los Angeles and New York. And if you get me really cranky, I just might fly over the White House and do a little fucking redecorating on that piece of shit. You're insane. Insane? No, I'm crazy. I mean, at least that's what the doctors say, and this is what crazy people do. And right now I got the power, I got the satellites, I got the stealth, I got the bombs, and please, Mr. President, don't think I won't use them. I almost forgot. Admiral Peterson. I don't need your fucking punk ass anymore. What the hell are you talking about? Go on, Admiral. Tell them how we got the access codes. Okay, fellows. You got a lot of work to do. Me? I got to go arm some nukes and program a few satellites, so you guys got about an hour to give me my goddamn money, or planes are going to start dropping on peach trees, you understand me? Ciao. Elliot, he's lying. He's crazy. Frank, when did you give him the codes? Elliot, come on. For Christ's sake. Guard! Guards! Get back! Get back! Don't shoot him. God. God, this isn't happening. Come on, now, Frank. Easy. Put down the gun. I can't. God! What have I done? I'm sorry, Harry. You ought to be. It hurts like hell. Listen, Frank. Listen to me. Put the gun down. We'll talk about it, okay? They were watching my family. They had pictures of my granddaughter's baptism. The sons of bitches said if I didn't cooperate, they would kill my family, one by one! There wasn't anything I could do! Frank. I had no choice! I had no choice! You think Mitchell can do this? I'll walk him through it. Good. Let's get this damn thing over with. Intercept, this is Iron Man. I have the bird. I'm taking her home. That's a negative, Iron Man. There's been a change in plans. Hold your position. I have clearance, intercept. That's a big negative, Iron Man. We need you to find that computer and disable it. Come again? The stealth is expendable. We have satellite complications. Find the computer, and we'll guide you through the procedure. Do you copy, sir? Roger. Out. Shit. They've gotten word to Mitchell. They're setting up a satellite relay via the carrier Coral Sea. As soon as he checks in, they'll hook us up. We've only got ten minutes. Let's hope we hear from him soon. Load her up with ABM-65s. Give me two B-83 nukes. Someone tripped the silent alarm downstairs. You want to play? Everybody wants to be like Mike. Intercept, this is Iron Man. Do you read me? Over. Roger, Iron Man. Are you in position? Affirmative, and I'm in a really big hurry. Roger that. We have your tour guide that's going to piggyback you to the trees. Open the relay to Washington. Iron Man, is the computer booted up? Yes. Good. Read to me what's on the menu. What are the modes? Search mode, targeting, diagnostic, hardware detect, reconnaissance, maintenance. Pull up maintenance. Now what? Now we're going to spoof the satellite and jam her up. I want you to type in "Perform self-test 0-0-4-7," then hit "enter." It says "If okay, perform self-check 0047." Are you sure this is right? Yes. You can initiate self-destruct with a string of three commands. I've got a flashing warning sign. It says "Exiting technical. Entering maintenance. Yes/No." Good. That's what we want. Hit yes. It doesn't seem to be responding. All right, Iron Man, steady. We need you to hold in there until the data stops processing. Otherwise, you'll go back to the old automated program. Come on. Come on. Damn right I don't. It's a done deal, sir. He did it! Yes. You weren't going to leave without saying goodbye, were you? You know I've never been big on long goodbyes. So I noticed when you ditched out in Nicaragua. Pretty nice? Take out a contra link. Fake my own death. Went down smooth as silk. Nobody figured it out. It was my first job as an independent contractor. What do they pay traitors nowadays? Pay's good. So are the benefits. Best thing is, I get to pick my own hours. I'm not connected to that bureaucratic bullshit you are. You should try it. Not interested. I don't like your retirement plan. It's too shortsighted. Yeah, well, you know, it beats social security. Don't even think about it. What's the matter, Mitchell? Want to do a little cowboy shit? No way. Just pull out the gun slowly and drop it. That's not a problem. So what are your orders now? Take me back to the States? Put me in jail? No, motherfucker. We're going to do it right here, right now. All right, Mitchell. Let's party. How'd that feel? That's all you've got? Is that all you've got? Fuck you. Come on. Get up! I ought to kill you, but I got something better for you. I'm going to let you live through it. I'm in pursuit of the stealth. Check for GPS reading. Iron Man, radar's picked up a blip. Coordinates vector 3-0-0, heading north by northeast. Roger, intercept. 3-0-0. I'm on it. You think Mitchell can catch this guy? An F-16's a hell of a lot faster. Let's say Mitchell does catch up with the stealth and blows it out of the sky. What happens to the nukes? They're not dangerous unless armed and fired. Where are you, you bastard? Iron Man, maintain course 3-0-0. Roger, intercept. This guy's good. He's heading straight for Cuba. Ten bucks says this is Mitchell. I don't take sucker bets, Turner. How does it feel to be back in the heat of battle? Pretty exciting? How does it feel to know you're about to die? We both know you're no closer. We'll see about that. Damn. Hard to lock tone on something that ain't there, good buddy? Hey, Turner, have you seen my watch lying around anywhere? What the hell are you talking about? You know, my global position watch. The one Uncle Sam gives you on bullshit missions like this. You might just check under your seat. You son of a bitch! Intercept, this is Iron Man. Mission completed. Yes! Yeah. Roger that, Iron Man. Good job. One question, intercept. Did Alpha One make the ride back? That's a big affirmative, Iron Man. All the chickens are back in the roost. Now that you've given us the all-clear, Operation Clean Sweep can commence. This is Operation Clean Sweep. We have the compound in sight. Commencing execution now. Iron Man. This is the president. Job well done. Thank you, sir. Colonel, if there's anything I can ever do for you... Well, sir, there is one thing. Here we go. Daddy! Hi, squirt. Come here, you. I want you to meet a very good friend of mine. President Westwood, J.P. Hi, J.P. Hello, Mr. President. Excuse me. Sure. How did you... You can blow out that candle now. Closed-Captioned By J.R.
