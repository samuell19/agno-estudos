Hi, my Momins! Are you enjoying my channel now? Are you saying I look pretty today? I followed Jun today. Why on earth are you looking at me? - It's scary. - Shut up! Let me introduce today's witnesses at the scene. I'm Taku of Boong Boong TV. He's just a nerd of old items. I'm Da-seul. She strips off her shirt every day. I don't strip. I change clothes. What's the difference? He always picks on me. Hey, what are you doing? - What? - Introduce yourself, you jerk. Han Jae-min. He's a ghost hunter. He'll argue with me but is just a con man. What bullshit! You chicken sexer. Look behind you. That's the place shown in Meo-teol's last video. He fabricated a video on such a terrible place. It was really hard to find it. Why do you skip me? When did you arrive? I'm speechless. You're the one who called me. She is Momo of the channel 'Strange.' She tells a scary story wearing gaudy clothes. Are you planning to say nonsense all night? What time is it now? It's midnight. I usually go to bed around this time. I'll explain quickly. Try to catch up on it. Meo-teol did a live show here two weeks ago. Then a woman wearing a black dress appeared at that time. That video must be a fabrication. Anyway, I know he always fabricates a video in the same pattern. The issue is that he quit uploading a video since then. He used to upload once every three days. He used to get many views with an edited version of a live show. However, viewers wondered whether his last video was real because... he didn't upload an edited version. It's rumored that something must have happened to him. People believe that the woman is a ghost. Damn it. They must have hypnotized. Let's cut the crap, and I'll show you that video clip. Some of you might haven't seen it yet. What is that? Huh? I know what it is. Burning something. It's on the tip of my tongue. Right. It's an incinerator. You guys always force me to enter whenever something is coming up. Huh? What is this place? I got a report that many people died here. This place looks organized. The outside looks terrible, though. It's totally absurd. What the hell! I'm shocked. I'm not going to shoot anymore. It looks terrible. Stop telling me there's something behind me, you jerk. In a mirror? In the mirror, is there a woman? Oh, no. Wait, what was it? Oh no! What the freak! Hey, something stood behind me, right? There was really someone there. Holy crap! Was someone standing in a hallway? What the heck is it? Come out! Oh, I'm so frustrated right now. I won't get scared by that crap. They say that's a ghost. Doesn't that make sense? She just put up too much makeup. Furthermore, a shaman said that she wasn't a human being. Who said that? - Myeongsin Bodhisattva. - Is that person a human? - Do you want me to call him? - She has to sleep at night. Today, I'll find the room she showed up and discover the truth. He keeps saying that she's a ghost. So I'll go inside and discover whether it's true or fabrication. End of discussion, all right? Hey, Meo-teol. You're watching us now, right? Stop pretending to be a missing person. I'll kick your ass. Streamer Wow, it's so dark. Only stars. You're right. A snake will come out. - A snake? - Yes. I hate snakes. Did he really enter here? It gives me goosebumps. Amazing! It's not a joke. Guys, can you see the voting box on the screen, right? Ghost hunter vs. Fabrication tester. Not right now. Vote after the broadcasting. You'll regret it if you get out in the middle of broadcasting. It's rare to see a fight of hunter against tester. Hey Daebangdong Cute Pig, I'm serious today. You've never given money to me. You always say bullshit, you jerk. I'll capture and barbecue you today. They're asking what we'll bet on. Bet your profits. Your profits are small. - You want to bet your month-worth profits? - I agree. Are you nuts? You don't have any profit. What's wrong with you? I've never seen you win a wager over Jun. When did I lose a wager? You lose every time. What a jerk he is! I can definitely win this time. It's less than two months since he uploaded an apology video clip. Did he repeat the same mistake after he had been in such trouble? That doesn't make sense. That video clip reached a thousand views. So what? Everyone would sell their souls for a thousand views. You keep saying that, although you have no idea what soul means. Are you picking a fight with me from the beginning? Is everyone watching them now? The war of nerves between them is severe, right? Do we see a ghost first, or will it be proven a fabrication? One of them will be damned. Me? I just want to take care of my image. - What the hell is it? - I'm shocked. What's wrong? It's a vine Holy crap! You surprised me to death, you jerk. She said she's only interested in her image. Oh, shit! I was steamed up a bit. Huh? There's a door. - Look over there. - Huh? This place is creepy. Are we entering for real? If not, why did you come here? I mean, it's really creepy. It's like experiencing fear. It's like an expedition to a haunted house. Should we do something before entering? Let's offer sacrifice, like a head of a dried pollack. What about offering you? You look like a head of a dried pollack. What's wrong? We met for the first time today. Hey, get out of my way. Get out. What is that? He's just wasting time. You idiot! You should take off your gloves. It's on fire. Wow, it's pretty. Was somebody dead? Why are you performing an ancestral rite? I've never been to this kind of place before. It's a fantastic place. Wow! What is this post? Time is life, so save even a second? If we save something, that's going to be a poop. A pig that eats poop. Wait. - Everyone, come here. - What's up? Off-limits Under investigation Oh, no. It's an old piece of a police line. Wow, look at this. - What is it? - A calendar. It's a piece of waste. There's a sign of the Olympics. The 1988 Seoul Olympics. Did an Olympics exist at that time? Right. The Olympics started that year. Wow, its history is long. It's older than me. Is she comparing her age with an Olympics? What are you eating? Apollo. - Apollo? - Yes. I picked it up a bit ago. Spit it out, you jerk. What is that? He's eating a snack produced at least 30 years ago. It's good. - You want to try it? - Do you want to die? Be quiet! It's a bat. A bat! Da-seul, be quiet. Wow, there's a bat here. Is it your first time seeing a bat? How can I see a bat in my daily life? Like you, the person who sucks others' blood can see it. - Me? - Oh my gosh. It's my first time seeing it. I can't believe it exists in real life. It's cute. - That's what I mean. - Right. It's fun. - It's like an amusement park. - A haunted house. Your house. You watch your mouth! - Hurry up and go. - Go now? - Take the lead. - Hurry up. Hurry up! You look so ugly. How did he find this kind of place? It's all blocked. Isn't it a hospital? Is it normal to block the windows with iron bars in a hospital? I mean, a mental hospital. - Aha, I see. - What is that? Oh, shocks! Why do you keep shouting? - Hey, get out. - I mean, over there. It's a church. - No, it's a chapel. - Aha, I see. Get out of my way. What is he taking out? What are you doing now? Wow, this camera looks interesting. - A heat sensor. - Sensor? This shows different colors depending on temperatures. Red for a living thing, blue for a ghost. So, if I put this button, What is this? Look here. It's blue. Really? Oh, it's deep blue. Why is it blue? It's really deep. It's stone, you idiot. A stone pillar. It's locked. - Taku, get in. - Me? Jae... min. It's scary. Taku, great park our. Oh, shit! You son of a bitch. Block the door. Open the door. Open it. Stop it. Are you a kid? He's saying he's scared. Okay. Let him get in. Hello. Okay. They are too noisy. Right. It's a mission of changing clothes. The winner gets a million won. I'll buy a bag on the Carrot Market. Right. Grab the door. What are you saying? Five thousand? Five thousand people? Oh, five thousand viewers. Wow. I see. I won't stop the live show today. Hey! Five thousand viewers are watching my show now. I saw a ghost. It's real. Is there Meo-teol? Did you see him? I saw a ghost here. Pray to God to help you. I don't have a religion. - He must be scared. - Open the door for him. Why did you guys make fun of me like this? I've got plenty of airtime. It was fun. Did you see a ghost? Don't go inside. It's scary. What's with the atmosphere here? It's so creepy. I'm scared. You jerk! What are you doing? I asked you what you are doing. - Be quiet. - All right. Hold on. It's a room for prayer. It's a chapel. It's a hospital. Why is there a chapel in a hospital? If a church operates a hospital, it makes sense. Can you see the iron bars over there? If it's not a prison, it's a mental hospital. Oh, Taku. You've got a point. You're smart. Everything is just peachy for him. This place is freaky. I would lose my mind if I was stuck in such a place. Da-seul. Come on! I'm sorry. I'm just kidding. I know it was my fan. Your fan Aoi Gesora wanted me to joke with you. Give her a piece of your mind. What is that? - What is it? - Hold on. Move over. Let's place it over there. Let's go. - Hey, Taku. - Huh? Please give me that cactus doll. - This one? - Yes. - Here it is. - Thank you. Oh, my head. I'm surprised. What is it? What's going on? It points to five steps. - It's really five steps. - Right. It's beautiful. It's scary, not beautiful. Scary, why? Why? It means that there's something over there. What do you mean? It's turned off. Shit! She's gone. Is she gone? Won't she come back? If we keep bothering her, she will come back. We're unwelcomed guests to her. Cut the crap. Did you see something up there? No, I didn't see anything. - Taku. - Huh? Do you want me to look through it? Go up. I have an acrophobia. Stop talking nonsense and go up. No. Why do you always force me to do something I don't want to do? That's enough. I'll go up. Thank you. - What is it? Is it an assignment? - You wuss. I really appreciate it. Be careful. Get away from it. Move over. It senses movements. What is this? What is it? Spiritual experience Oh, shocks! Look at it. Oh my! Jae-min. Han Jae-min. Han Jae-min! Did you see it, right? Horror mission, clear. Right? Oh, come on. What? Where is everyone? You crazy freaks. Get me the ladder. I'll take off my clothes to make this video banned from broadcasting. - She's going to take off for real. - Get it quickly. The son of bitches. Get it quickly. She's not joking. She will take off her clothes for real. Shit! He's the one who planned all of this. Do you want to die? I didn't. He persuaded all of us to do it. It's true. He's the one. Your fan forced me to do it. If you have an issue, pick a fight with your fan. You, son of a bitch! Hi, my Momins. Are you enjoying the show? Seven thousand viewers? Amazing. Why didn't you go to bed this late at night? Aren't you going to sleep? Drink stimulants and stay awake. I'll give you gifts. The viewer staying at the show's end will get a gift. You're right. This place is fun. I'm considering doing a joint show with Jae-min. Let's do a joint show next week. - No. - When will we do it again? I won't. He's just saying no because he confessed to me after being drunk. Stop saying it. Why do you tell my secret on air? So, please stop confessing to me after drinking. She's a crazy bitch. - What? - A crazy bitch. Date him? Are you kidding me? How can I date a guy who is a social misfit? Why are you staring at me, you idiot? Oh my! Goodness! You must be chicken-hearted. Oh no. What's wrong? What's wrong with you? Is it supposed to rain today? I'm asking you, idiot. Is rain expected today? The weather in Gangneung is clear. What is he talking about? Where are we now? What is this place? It's hung outside. The second dormitory room Can you see something inside? - What is place? - A dormitory. People can't live in this kind of place. It's just a prison. I feel weird. Me too. The intensity of thunder here is more substantial than in other areas. By the way, aren't you feeling a headache? All of a sudden, I got a severe headache. I feel some heaviness in my chest. Chest? Here in my chest. It's getting heavier a bit go. I can hold them up. What? - Try to hold it. - What? Try to hold my chest. No. I was just joking with you. I'm sorry. Are you serious? Stay and wait here for a while. Do you want to pee? No. I need to practice a mission of changing clothes. Right now? My fans want me to practice here. They say the place looks scary most. I'll be back after changing clothes quickly. Please wait for me. He will bawl us out if we don't follow him. So, will you leave me alone here? I'll never leave you alone. - Don't go anywhere. - Yes. It's not a joke. It's really scary. Take a look at it. There's mold. Wow. I'll change my clothes now. Aoi Gesora, it's a bet of a million won. Don't chicken out of it. - Taku. - Yes. - Stay there. - Okay. I'm scared. Huh? Wow. Thank you. Hey! What are you doing there? I'm waiting for Da-seul. Hurry up. You made me look for you everywhere again, you jerk! Da-seul, I have to now. Follow us after changing it quickly. Hey! Where are you going? Hey! I took off my clothes. Hey! I'm not going to play with him anymore. He's evil. I'm done with the mission. Hey, where are you? Why didn't you answer me? - Are we at the right place? - Yes. - Let's go inside. - Hold on. It's a sealing amulet. What is it? It seals something inside. What does it seal? We're already in a haunted house. I want to follow you. Okay, follow us. Won't you enter? Oh, no. - It's dust all over the place. - What is this? Park Chung-hee, Chun Doo-hwan. - It must have been built a long time ago. - Meo-teol, the bastard. What is he talking about? Wait! Why? - What's that? - He fabricated a video with that mirror. Really? Who did that? What's wrong with you? Meo-teol. Meo-teol? Ah, I remembered. - Hey. - What? Did you follow us without knowing the purpose? I just followed Momo. For what? I know. It's exploring a haunted house. Everyone I brought isn't normal. Is it for an expedition to a haunted house? - Tell me about it. - Da-seul, come here. - Stand behind me. - Okay. Do not stand. Can you see a chair over there? Take a seat on it. Da-seul. Please, take a seat on it. Good. Where are you going? What are you doing? What? There's no picture. Picture? Some incident must've happened here. How can you know that? Do you remember seeing a police line? Yes. That's related to this room. They sealed the room with an amulet because they couldn't appease the souls. What is the object the amulet was used for? An evil spirit. Are you here with us? When did you die? Would you tell me why did you die? What had happened here? Are you here with us? When did you die? Would you tell me why did you die? What had happened here? Everyone! Gather around. Wait a minute. Can you see Da-seul sitting behind me? Yes, I can see. All right. Let's start judging. I am reflected in the mirror, and there is a look of Da-seul behind me. Again. Da-seul is reflected in the mirror, but she disappeared when I turned the camera. I'll do it slowly this time. Da-seul is reflected in the mirror if I turn the camera slowly, - Move over. - Okay. In this state, I'm turning the camera slowly. Meo-teol acted as if he was scared to acquire time for a woman to approach his back. If I turn the camera to the mirror... Da-seul. The end of judgment. Is it real? Amazing, right? No one can figure out the trick if not in the scene. He just used a simple trick and framed our attention with a camera. Viewers believe that the scenes on the camera are authentic. Wow. You sound like a genius. Do you understand me? What? You're so conceited. Hold on. Is Meo-teol smart enough to plan all of it? It's a surprise. I've learned something about living a life today. You know, don't judge a book by its cover. Look at him. He acts the same as he looks like. He looks like a head of a dried pollack. Anyway, it ended. I'm sorry. It's done so early. It's not done yet. Don't you know that Meo-teol fabricated a video to attract viewers? He just pretended he was missing. Okay. Let's assume he fabricated a video. However, what is that amulet? That one is a real one. Why does it remain till now? Well, I don't know. Anyway, you admit that he fabricated a video. Yes. Yes. Let's vote online. - Okay. - Okay. Who is the 2% on your side? Is your family? Don't mention my family. Don't frown, and be cool, you narrow-minded. Why don't you give my Momins gifts? Gifts? Okay. Two million won. I'll give each one of the 20 people a hundred thousand won. Don't end the show on your will. I have something to do. Please, stop. Are you going to pull an all-nighter? The end of the competition. I'll say goodbye when I get out of here. 8,600 viewers? It's sad to end the show. Anyway, see you soon. Wow. It's a super surprise. Jae-min found a camera behind the mirror a bit ago. He said it might be Meo-teol's. It doesn't make sense. There was no way he left his camera here. - Play it. - What? Play it to check the owner out. Play it. Play it. Did you see it? It's Meo-teol's. - Camera... - It's his. What? What if he set the camera in advance? What are you talking about? He knows we're here. I'm 100% sure he's watching us. Cut the crap. Who would waste eight million won just for fabrication? It's a thousand views. Eight million won is small potatoes. No way. Something must've happened to him. What's wrong with you, Jae-min? It's not ethical, no matter how much you hate Meo-teol. Do you wish something happened to him? Do you wish he would have died? - What? - What's wrong? Oh, no! What's going on? - What's wrong? - Why are you shouting? What's happening? Shit! - Shit. - It's tough... You son of a bitch! Why do you hit me? Why? You pushed me before. Me? I didn't. Oh goodness! By the way, why did we run off? Oh, my! She's a crazy bitch. Da-seul, what's wrong with you? What's wrong with her? I want to get out of here. Please, get out of here. Tell me what happened. Move over. What's wrong? - Hey. - Come on. Press the auto-save list. It's a thousand views. Eight million won is small potatoes. No way. Something must've happened to him. What's wrong with you, Jae-min? It's not ethical, no matter how much you hate Meo-teol. Do you wish something happened to him? Do you wish he would have died? What is it? Is it a body? It's a dead body. It's Meo-teol. Meo-teol? The son of a bitch. Hey! - Hey! - Wait for me! Where is he? He ran away. Where is he? I said he ran away. Oh, no! What happened? - He's gone. - Right? He's playing the fool with us. I hate being fooled. He's getting worked up. If he catches Meo-teol, he'll kill him. I think so, too. Meo-teol, the bastard, is doing a ridiculous thing. The bastard. Who's there? You must be Meo-teol. You son of a bitch! What the hell? After getting through all of it, I don't hate him anymore. Yes. He deserves to be getting rich. Right. There's always a reason to become famous. By the way, is he really Meo-teol? What? We didn't see a face. What if he isn't Meo-teol? Do you think that's a ghost? You'd better shut up and sleep You always ignore me. Do you have something to eat? All sorts of snacks. Come on. Anything else? I have cup noodles. Come on! - Don't you like it? - I love it. - Let's go quickly. - Let's go. Everyone, I'll take a brief break. It's a late-night eating show. What? It's closed off. Look at that shutter. It's locked. Who locked it? It must be Meo-teol. You said there's no ghost. He must've gone crazy. A box? What is this? Shit. It's a sealing amulet. It's a sealing amulet. Am I Meo-teol? If I open it mindlessly, an evil spirit will haunt me. Are you here with us? When did you die? Would you tell me why did you die? What had happened here? Run away. Oh, no! What's it? What? You're crazy. Are you playing hide-and-seek? Come down. Come down! I'll go up and beat you up. You bastard! Where is he? I'll kick his ass. What is that? A photo? Oh goodness! Sori welfare center? What? Kidnapping, confinement, violation of human rights, and genocide? What is this? I definitely heard something. Who are you? No matter who you are, I'll kill you if I catch you. What's wrong? Why are you shouting? I'm surprised because you opened the door suddenly. Did you expect me to knock on the door? Didn't you knock on the door? - Knocking? - Yes. What are you talking about? If you didn't, what was it? - You're the one who went up there? - Where? The attic over there. Yes. I thought something came up there. What do you mean? A doll. It must've ringed due to you. It rang before I went up. What's the problem? - Meo-teol shut it down. - He shut it down. Shut down what? The entrance shutter! He's crazy. Wait. Is he shooting us now? I'll check it out. Taoist Meo-teol It's not airtime Nothing's on air. He's not doing a live show. Is he not doing it? Didn't you see something weird up there? I didn't. Some strange sound or feeling? Didn't you feel cold or weird feeling? What are you talking about? I didn't feel anything. Be straight with me. It's not a time to keep your head up. Just be honest with me! I'm not keeping my head up. It's all set by Meo-teol. What are you guys doing now? Are you fighting each other? I'm not fighting, but he keeps saying nonsense. Please listen to what I'm saying. What is it? Who's there? The bastard! - I'm coming with you. - Where are you going? Wait for me! - Wait for me. - I'll beat this guy to death. - Please stop running. - What's going on? Please. I'm exhausted. Come on. Please. I finally found him. He's sitting over there. He made fun of us. He made all of us a fool. - You only care about making money. - Hey, get up! Tickle him! Take off the plastic bag. He doesn't give up setting up a situation. Get up, you bastard. - What? - Hold on. Come on! Please save us. - Who locked the shutter? - It's Meo-teol. He's dead. How could he lock it? Hey, shut up! Do not shout at her! I'm scared... I'm asking you. Please be quiet. You're annoying me. Please be quiet to think straight. Do you think you're the only smart person here? It's okay. Da-seul, look at me. Everything is fine. Do not joke, and be honest with me. Is there anyone who locked the shutter? - No one, right? - We didn't. - Right? - Yes. Okay. Meo-teol is dead. We identified his death a bit ago. Then, who locked it? I saw a strange guy in the hallway a moment ago. Hold on. Is there someone in this building? Then, did he kill Meo-teol? Hey! It's 112, an emergency call. Hello. I want to report a criminal case. Please describe the situation. I found a body. A body? Are you sure? Yes. Please tell me the address. 14-3 Muyeon-gun, Gangneung-si. Could I have your name, please? Kang Hyun-jun. I'll send you the police on patrol nearby. How long does it take for them to arrive here? Hold on, please. It'll take about 20 minutes. Okay. Please hurry up. And I need a cutter because the entrance door is locked. Did you check out other doors? Not yet. Then, please check them out. We'll be there as soon as possible. Keep your cell phone turned on. Okay. You guys stay here for a while. Okay. Taku, come with me. Why me? Follow me. Let's check out whether there's an exit. Do not talk back to me. Oh no... A murderer is wandering in the building. Huh? There's a door. Isn't it opening? Oh shit! - Hey. - Why? Did something happen to Meo-teol that night, right? What do you mean? I mean, that woman wearing a black dress is real. What? You obviously lost the bet. We should make our fans vote again. You're uncomprehending, you jerk. It's an important issue. Jae-min must be feeling the bet result was unfair. - You want to die? - I'm sorry. By the way, Shut up your mouth! I mean, the woman, didn't she be confined here? Search the 'Sori welfare center' on the internet. - Why? - Just do it. Okay. It's a business performed before the 1988 Seoul Olympics to clean the streets. They kidnapped and confined the homeless, the disabled, and even ordinary citizens, including women and kids, then raped, assaulted, and killed them. What had happened here? - Is it true? - Keep reading. Okay. The director killed himself when the police started an investigation. While a joint investigation party was investigating, they found many remains in an incinerator. The fact that there were children's remains shocked the public. What? They burned the bodies. Did it really happen in our nation? I haven't heard of it. What is it? It makes me creepy. Did they really kill people here? It's not here, right? Please tell me it's not here. Oh, no. It's hair. Dump it. Please wait for me. By the way, why is there something related to Moran Market here? Cut the chatter and follow me. Get out of my way. Oh, come on. Every shutter is locked. - Ouch! - What's wrong? - It stings. - What happened? I got a mosquito bite. Are you kidding me? It's a mountain mosquito. You know, a striped one. Why did it only bite me? Wow... You're incorrigible. We're here! Now, we can get out of here. We can survive. - What a relief! - Here! We're here! Please hurry up and get us out of here. It's all done. Please calm down. Why do you have so many cameras? You'd better catch your breath. Who was reporting? It's me. Kang Hyun-jun. Did you say you found a body, right? Yes. Up there. Please unlock it first. How did you get in there? When we entered, it was open. Someone locked it later. Who? I'll explain it in detail, so open it, please. He's right. Why are you staring me up and down? Why are you looking at me? - Is it real? - What? I also watch this kind of video. Isn't it calling a policeman to increase views? What are you talking about? Please unlock it. Are you sure you found a body? Come on! Come in and see it with your eyes. Open it and identify the body with your eyes. If it is a false report, I can arrest you immediately. Arrest? We didn't do wrongdoings. You're ridiculous. Don't you have a brain, you pig? What? Pig? You heard me right, you pig. You doubt us without identifying a scene. - Stop it. - Come on! Getting angry can't solve a problem. We should calm down and talk slowly with me. Right. We should talk with him. Frankly, I understand him. This late at night, holding a camera, wearing a Santa Clause dress, isn't it suspicious? If I were him, I would doubt whether we would try to get attention. Do I look suspicious? I'm not a member of this party. They forced me to join them. - It's true. - Do I look suspicious? Hey, move over. Policeman, open it, please. - You surely found a body, right? - Yes. If it isn't true, it's a false report and obstruction of justice. And if this building is private property, you trespassed it. It's not a minor crime. All right? - I see. Please open it. - Come on. Wait a minute. Is he going to arrest us? You idiot! Hey, do I look weird? No, you don't. You said I look weird. I mean, wearing a Santa Clause dress in summer is normal? Then, am I abnormal? Hey, please be quiet. You always criticize me. - What's wrong? - Hold on. What's wrong with you? - Please. - I have to answer it. - It's an important call. Hold on. - Please open it! - Please open it first. - Wait a minute. Hello. I'm at the scene. Did all of you already gather? What a jerk he is. Okay. I'll join you in a minute. Don't drink too much till I come. Drink? What? A body? They're just talking nonsense. He doesn't believe us now. - He's crazy. - It'll end soon. So please wait a minute... What? What's wrong with him? - What? - Hey. What's wrong with him? What's going on? Momo, are you okay? Don't touch me. Momo, put your hand on my shoulder. Are you okay? I'm okay. What a relief. What happened to the policeman? Was he attacked by a ghost? Everything will be fine. It was on the air. - The police will come here soon. - Hey! Where is Da-seul? Da-seul? Where is Da-seul? Da-seul. What? Isn't she answering? The phone isn't working at all. Where are you going? Momo! Where are you, Da-seul? What? Where is he? Where is he? I can't believe it. The policeman disappeared. Take a look at this. What is that? The Da-seul's channel. Is it on air now? Is she being dragged? What? It's Meo-teol. Hey! Hey! Stay there. Don't go anywhere. Hey! Please wait for me! Please wait for me! What's wrong with it? Why isn't anyone here? Da-seul! Da-seul! Oh, shit! Where is the battery? It's already running down. Shit! Oh my god! What is it? Oh goodness! Shit! Where on earth is he? Hey! Come on. Wait. What? Da-seul! Da-seul! What the hell is it? Oh, no. The year 1988. Gosh! Shit! What's going on? Who are you? Lift it more. More! A little more. Hold it! Oh, no. Hold it quickly. - Cramp! Cramp! - What? I have a cramp in my arm. What the hell are you doing, you idiot? I have a cramp. It's so painful. You're incapable of doing anything nice. You do it. Don't force me to do it. Damn it! It's annoying. How can I get out of here? Ghost Jaemmin? Jae-min! Have you found Da-seul? Momo, where are you now? I'm in the lobby. You said to us to stay here. Come to the director's office now. Director's office? Come here now. Here is Da-seul, too. Really? Is she fine? She's fine. She is looking for you. Please come right away. Hey, wait for me. What's wrong with you? His voice. What's wrong with his voice? Never mind. Momo. What's wrong? What is it? I have no idea. What is it? I don't know. How should I know? A minute ago, we got a call from Jae-min, right? Ghost Jaemmin Please save us! What are you going to do with that? Everyone, are you watching us now? Please save me. Please report the situation to the police. The address is... What is the address? I don't know. You should have known it. Why should I know it? You idiot... Welfare center, Sori welfare center! What is it? I heard here is the Sori welfare center. Everyone, please search the address of the center on the internet and report it. Please call the police. Where? Incinerator? What? They say there's a door near an incinerator. A door? They say Meo-teol entered the building through that door. What is this? A blueprint. I shouldn't have followed you guys here. By the way, how did you know it? - A blueprint? - No. The welfare center. Jun made us do an online search about it. By the way, a lot of people died here. People were beaten or sick to death or killed themselves. They burned the bodies, including children. Children? You know the Moran Market, which is a cage confining people. I read they confined people in the Moran Market. - You said it's a welfare center. - Right. According to what you said, it's not a welfare center. Then, what is it? Welfare center offers welfare. Right. It should offer welfare. Why did they kill people? Killing people was welfare at that time? Please be quiet. Why? Didn't you hear a sound a bit ago? What? I think I heard something. I heard a woman laughing. What are you talking about? Is there someone here except for us? Did you see it, right? A girl! Please wait for me! Oh shit! What is this? Who did it? I don't know. Isn't it the right way? I guess it's an incinerator. You don't know anything at all. I know something. What do you know? The year 1988... - The street clean-up business. Kidnapping, confinement... - Shut up! It's an incinerator - This is... The children's bodies... Bodies... Run away. Please wait for me! You son of a bitch, I'll kill you. Why doesn't it work? Please... It's hot! Please... Hey... Hey... Momo! Taku! Jae-min! Ah, Broadcasting! Jae-min! Where is he? What? Oh goodness! Oh, no... The girl we saw... - Did he die here? - Why? She must have held a grudge because she died here. Ghost's bullying is to return the pain they suffered from people. Who said that? That's what adults normally say. They torment a living being until they're satisfied. Do they bully people, although they don't have any sin? They don't choose specific people when they bully. Do they let people go when they're satisfied? Maybe they will kill them? - Come on! - What's wrong? Whenever you open your mouth, it's all about getting killed. If you want to die, you die alone. I don't want. Then, stop saying we'll die. Okay. Whenever you open your mouth, you say shit! I'm scared... There were many places we could hide but... The church is much scary than other places. Anyway, a ghost can't enter a chapel. It's protected by Jesus Christ. Are you hungry? Yes. What is it? I packed it to keep a proper amount of sugar. You eat it. What about you? I'm fine. I have enough sugar. I need to get an insulin shot. - It's all yours. - You eat it, too. You're kind. You too. Being kind is a shortcut to hell. By the way, Does a revengeful spirit bully and kill people without reason? Yes. However, there are kind ghosts. However, she held revenge against people. Having a warm mind as a revengeful spirit is weird. You idiot! Momo, your head... What's wrong with my head? Oh my... What is it? Oh goodness! Hey, run! What happened? Were you with Jae-min? There's only a camera, not Jae-min, in the room with an amulet. Is there no Jae-min? Yes. Are you sure? What's wrong? What's wrong with you? Jae-min is dead. What nonsense! We saw it. Jae-min was... Shut up. Why is he dead? He's dead. In the room, he was strangled. Hey, the girl did it all, right? She's revenging us because she was cooped up here and died, right? She's a bitch. The son of a bitch. The crazy bitch. What's wrong? She killed everyone. She's the director of the center. She killed over 300 people. She sold people's organs and sent bodies to hospitals. She even sold children to Japan. However, she was caught up by the police. When the police put her on a wanted list and chased her, she hanged herself. Why did she commit that kind of crime? Shit! Due to money. She did all of it due to money! Jae-min was right. People blocked the room because she did bad things even after being dead. However, we entered the room, right? Will we die because we entered? I said to you, do not say we're going to die. You said you could survive. You said you have six lives. How can I survive? I can't get out of here! We'll be confined here forever like her... Hey, let's go up. - Please. - Where? Let's go to the rooftop, climbing up the ladder next to a wall. Will go really go there? Yes. You stay here. No! Oh, it's open. Do you hear it? - It's the police. - Let's go down! - Hold on! - Why? What about Da-seul? What about Da-seul? Let's get out of here first. Let's find her with the police later. Hurry up! Okay. Why don't they come here? Oh no... What's wrong with it? Please. Shit! Please come here. We're here. I'm so scared. Momo! Momo... Now... something touches... What's wrong? What's wrong? Taku... Please save me... Taku... Taku... Please stop it! Where am I? Momo! Taku! Momo! I found a way out. Can't you hear me? Oh, no. Please save me. Please help me. Jun found a way out He's entering the director's office Really? Did he find a way out? It's exciting Let's get one million views Is it fun? Is it fun for you? People are dead here. Is it fun for you? If you take off your underwear, I'll give you money. I'm giving you money now You act so well Okay. Spend money. Spend more money. I'll get out of here. I'll escape somehow.
