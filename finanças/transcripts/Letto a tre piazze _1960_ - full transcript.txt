THE TRIPLE-SIZED BED Good morning, professor. - Lot of packages, huh? - Thank you. - Look... - You always shop. Look how nice it is. - Wonderful! - I bought it for a person. - For me? - Not for you. For my wife. - Ah, for your lady. - Yes. Today we celebrate 10 years of marriage. - What? - 10 years. - They weigh a lot, huh? - What weight? - I am a happy husband. - I have no doubt. That's right, Professor Peppino Castagnano is a happy husband. Who wouldn't be with a wife like that? In fact, Amalia Castagnano, as you can see, is not just a beautiful woman, but also an angel in the house. So, almost like in fairy tales, Peppino and Amalia are happily married for 10 years. 10 years without arguments. 10 years of happiness never clouded by the usual and ordinary crisis that disturb marriages. The well-known crisis of the fifth, seventh and ninth year. Such radiant happiness shouldn't be troubled by any shadow. But, as a matter of fact, there's a shadow. Small, very tenuous, insignificant, but there's a shadow. Here it is. Represented by this portrait. The portrait of Amalia's first husband who died in the Russian campaign 20 years ago. The late Antonio Di Cosimo. What is this? Lietta dear, I bought you the watch you've been waiting for a long time. - Thanks a lot. - Now will you give me a gift? But Peppino, no need to remind me! I already bought you a sweater, dear. No, my dear. I didn't mean that. You are always nice to me... but... Let's get the dearly departed out of there. Take it off. - Ugh. - Yes, ugh. If I eat or drink or read or there are people in here, he always looks at me. I cannot stomach him. He's a sword of Damocles. But, Peppino, this is your obsession. Antonio was so good, so peaceful. It's a mania, Peppino. Okay, but he's still a dead. So, dead for dead, let's hang a still life. A beautiful picture. Look. Look. Look how nice it is. - What's this? A lobster? - Do you like it? She's dead but looks alive. Let's put this on. Dear Peppino, you don't know that I kept it to avoid bad luck. I feel like if I take it off, something happens to me. Darling, but you said that Antonio was a good man when alive. And if he was good when alive, imagine when dead. - Let's take it off. Let's take it off. - OK. Look, the cake is on the table. Put it in the fridge or it will melt. Go, go. Prassede! Prassede! Eh, now you're going away! Prassede! Great! Always on the phone! Excuse me, ma'am, my boyfriend calls me when he can. All right. Go, my husband is calling you. Hurry up. Hello?Hello? No, calm down. I was talking to the lady. - Prassede! Come a moment! - Here I am! I come! - Hello. - Who's there? Ugh. Don't start again. Yes I start again. Because you have to tell me who you were with. I heard the voice of a man next to you. Who is it? Enough with these stupid jealousies. It's the master. Should I kick him out of his house? Prassede, what are you doing? Are you sleeping? "Are you sleeping"? So are you in bed? What's the master doing in your room? What are you saying, Ninuccio? The master shouts that I'm asleep because I'm on the phone! I've to go now. I'm saying this because I love you. OK. - Do you love me? - Sure. Bye. You leave now, sweetie. - Oh! Are you done? - Excuse me, professor. - Put this somewhere. - Where? For now, put it in the cellar. Then slowly you'll move it away, once here, once there, until you'll throw it in the trash. - Ok. - Hurry up! And don't let my wife see you! Ah! I took a weight off my stomach. That jinx in my house. Long live the bride and groom. Long live the bride. Thank you. Long live the bride... Counselor, do I deserve, a "long live the bridegroom"? Sure. Long live the bridegroom! Speech. Speech, please. I am a modest professor of History, Latin, Greek, Geography. I would not find the right words to... enjoy this happy moment. Since you insist, it means that I will borrow those of our great poet Dante Alighieri. And precisely those of the twenty-sixth chapter - from the Vita nova. - Very well. - Counselor Vacchi. - Yes. - I'd like to declaim. - Please. Thank you. "So kind and so honest she looks" "my woman, when she greets others," "that every tongue becomes shaking, mute," "and eyes dare not look at her." "And eyes dare not look at her". "And eyes dare not look at her". Counselor Vacchi. They don't have to look at her. They don't have to look at it. - But Dante doesn't say that. - OK, but I do. Counselor, don't you think we're exaggerating? Why, exaggeration? Faced with this happy marriage, I am open-mouthed and I wonder if there's anything in the world that can cloud it. What? What? Counselor, no one can cloud it! Comrade, will you allow me? I'm sorry, good man, but I have no change for alms. If you return tomorrow, I'll give you the leftovers from dinner. How dare you? You big dummy! Am I a begging type? Leftovers from dinner? Watch me! But dressed like this... What does that prove? Clothes don't make the man. I did the whole Russian campaign with this dress. And I say Russia! Under this dress is a hero. I'm shabby but not a beggar. I'm a veteran! I'm a veteran, I want it known. Do me a favor, go away. I don't have time to waste. - This house is full of guests. - Oh, congratulations. You invite guests without letting me know. But what do you care? Are you the master of this house? Of course, I am. This is the Di Cosimo house and I am Di Cosimo. No, it's the Castagnano house. - Castagnaro? [chestnut merchant] - Castagnano! - Who is this Castagnano? - The master. Ah, so my wife doesn't live here anymore. Of course, 20 years have passed. Maybe she sold it. Meanwhile, the Castagnaro got rich on the black market and bought it. In fact it's all renewed, all painted. Look, do me a favor. Go away or I'll be in trouble. Yeah, I should leave like that! I want to know what happened to my wife! Let me talk to an any Castagnaro. All right. Enter here. - Here? - Yes. - Are there chestnuts? But what chestnuts! Come in! Did you shrink the doors? What have you done? Don't push! What happens? Crazy things! This is a madhouse. No, there must be a squatter here! Certain things... And this junk? These awful books? What are they for? There was a pantry here. I had put in a nice pantry! Some hams that were a masterpiece. Mountain hams that the mere smell made you drunk. Each ham cost an arm. A thousand lire each. A thousand lire each! The salary of a clerk. A thousand lire each. Not to mention other products. Caciocavalli, pasta, noodles, rice, beans, chickpeas, lentils, sausages! Each sausage was like that. Where did you put all this stuff? I want to know where did you put them! I haven't seen them! When did you put them on? What do you mean "when"? Shortly ago... in July 1940. - Ah, twenty years ago. I wasn't born yet. - No? No, stay quiet. I'm going to tell the lady. They ruined everything. It's all because of progress. I sat him in the studio. He's shabby and a little... crazy. He insisted. He wants to talk to someone. Who knows... - Maybe he's unemployed and sent by Father Ignazio. - I don't know. OK, I'm going to talk to him. Don't disturb the professor. Amalia! An... tonio! Amalia dear, my faithful bride. Antonio, is it really you? Yes, in skin and bones, as you see. A survivor. - You're back. Oh my God! - Dear Amalia... Don't faint, Amalia. Come on, darling. Oh my God, I feel faint too. Counselor, forgive my outburst of few moments ago, but besides being Italian, I'm a southerner and I'm jealous. Well, with such... with such a wife, you're more than justified. I repeat... woe if I knew that other arms touch her, that other hands caress her. I'd be capable of anything, even killing. - Well, let's not exaggerate. - Let's do it, counselor. Even killing. Amalia, my Amaliuccia. Come back, Amalia. - I'll get the smelling salts. - No. - The vinegar? - No, I don't need it. - No? - Stay here. - So you're not dead? - No. Why aren't you dead? Right! What do I know? But Amalia, you look almost sorry. Oh no, it's not that, but... I'm faced with an extraordinary fact. - I know. - It's a miracle. - You're right. You haven't given any news for 20 years. You know, the Russian mail service works badly. With all that snow, the postmen walk slowly. They're careful, as it's slippery. - A postman died over there. - Everyone thought you were dead too. Yes? But I'm alive. Very much alive, from head to toe! I've never been so alive as now. My Amalia, how long has it been? Antonio, not now. - And when? - I don't know, later. I've been waiting for this moment for 20 years. 20 very long years, you know? If you had seen me while I was in the Siberian jungle. I was always thinking of you. I said to myself, the day will come... I mean, the night will come when I warm up next to my Amaliuccia. - Ama', I'm cold. - Antonio, poor thing. I'm sorry, but you know, this isn't the time. It isn't. This house is full of people, someone might come. - Oh my God, Antonio. - Amalia! Look, a lot has changed in 20 years. In fact, I see some notable changes. By the way, the "comrade" waitress told me there's a new owner here. Exactly. That's right. - One who sells chestnuts. - What? A castagnaro? Not Castagnaro, Castagnano! Well, more or less... Castagnaro, Castagnano... - Look, Antonio. - Tell me. - Stay calm. - I am calm. - I must tell you one thing. - Say it. I must, you know? I understand, don't tell me. You want to tell me that you rented our apartment because you needed money. You did very well. All women should do this. Tell me, this Castagnaro... is he? That one? But that's Giuseppe Verdi! Oh, it's true! How silly of me. Giuseppe Verdi. He did look familiar. Antonio, this is no time for jokes. You're right. I'm sorry. Oh, my head. I'm sorry but, you know, my brain is frozen. You know, the snow in Russia is no small thing. It falls from above and goes on the head. Tic, tic, on and on. Antonio. We'll talk about this later. When we're alone. Yes, alone. That's what I want. Send everybody away. I will, but you have to stay here. - Yes. - And don't move. - I don't. - Be quiet. - Even if they kill me. Yes, I'll stay here. I'll wait. I'll wait here... But why should I? I can't understand. I've found my home. I'm dead tired. I come from Siberia on foot. Who is she? Carnera? Now I go to the bedroom and lie down. Yes. Damn this door! I have to widen it. We have to send our guests away. - What's going on? - Nothing. I'll tell you later. But now send them away, please. - We must be alone. - I get it, you wanna be alone with me. You're right. It's our party and we have to enjoy it. I'm sorry, I thank you all for coming to this little party. I thank you all, but my wife Lietta, maybe because she had a busy day, - is not feeling well and would like to go to bed. - OK, OK. - Good evening, professor. - Let's leave husband and wife alone. Thanks. Many thanks. Lots of changes, huh? Hungarian style bedroom. Very nice. Ah, the scent! Thank you. Thanks, ma'am. I understand you, dear professor, I understand you. As Dante said, "It can't be understood by one..." "... who hasn't experienced it". Good night, Counselor Vacchi. - Goodbye, counselor. - Goodbye, counselor. Again. We must not invite this counselor anymore. - He's a nuisance and a rude person! - You're right. Forget him. I need to talk to you about important things I know, I've been waiting for this moment all evening and he never left. Sure, Peppino. But please, listen to me. How can I not listen to you? I go to my room, I wear something comfortable and you'll tell me what you want, until 2 or 3... until 4 o'clock, my darling. Damn, he won't let me talk. Antonio. Antonio! Gosh, where did he go? Antonio! Antonio! What is it? Mamma Mia! - Hey, he's a beast? - Where did he get in? - He stinks! - You stink! How dare you? Who are you? Who let you in? Are you a thief? Who are you? What are you doing in my bed? Get out! I'm totally within my rights, do you understand? No, I'm within my rights. Get out! No, it's me. You must tell me who you are. Oh, am I supposed to say who I am? It's you who must tell me who you are! - It's you who... - It's you and don't raise your voice! - Get out! - Don't raise your voice! I'm an hero, inform yourself! What hero?! Please! Please, calm down! I'll explain everything! - Who is he? - Amalia, who is this intruder? Intruder? Who is this bum? He stinks! - I stink? You're the one who stink! - Peppino, calm down. - You don't know who I am! - Peppino, calm down. - Lietta! Peppino? Lietta? Ah, very good. You're using pet names. Tell me who is this Peppino! Yes, I'll tell you right away. - Well? - Speak, who is it? - I can't wait! - When you left... - Well? - Well? - When I left... - He came. - Excuse me Amalia, if I.. I'm sorry, Amalia I'm sorry if I thought wrong. You too, forgive me. - What does this want? - Come into my arms. - To who? - I'm your father. - Who? You're gross! - Gross? - Don't touch me. - Papa who comes from the war is gross? - Antonio! - This is how you raised this idiot! Antonio, please... - I'll put you in boarding school! - What?! - How can you think that? How can he be my son, Antonio? That's what I was thinking. He's an old fool. - Imagine... - Hey! - Will you tell me who is this? Peppino, please, look at him. Show yourself. - Don't you recognize him? - Wait... - The dead man! - Dead? - A Siberian man! - Siberian man? - The snow man! - What snowman? I'm alive! Very much alive! Totally alive! Tell me who is this jinx? Speak, for God's sake! Or I'll make a mess. Something that will you remind the fight at the Steppe! Antonio, everyone thought you died 20 years ago. There was your name on the headstone of the fallen. Yes? But I'll delete it tomorrow. But in the meantime I... well... In the meantime, what? Amalia, speak, for God's sake! I'm on pins and needles! This is my new husband. - No... this... husb... - Yes. Amalia, have you gone mad? Hold it. This one? So you're a bigot? - She's a bigot! - What are you saying?! - No way she's bigamist! - Shut up! You wretch. You take advantage of other people's wives... of a warrior who is in the Siberian steppe. - Warrior... - Jackal! - Who is a jackal? Jackal and hyena! You are a hyena! Take him away! Get him out or I'll eat him! I'll slaughter him! Go Savoy, attack! It's you, Antonio! Show them who you are! Oh my God! Help! Prassede! Come here. - Ma'am, what's going on? - Stay out of this. - Call Counselor Vacchi. Get him immediately. - OK. I'll show you who I am! Counselor Vacchi, leave my wife alone! I want to see you in jail! Jackal! - Me a jackal? - Bring him... Counselor, hold him down, not me. He bites, you know? - Calm down. - I'll show you if I bite. Counselor, ask him what he did in these 20 years. What did you do when you were dead? What I did? What are you doing, counselor? A dance? - That's what I'm saying too. - I've been fighting for these 20 years. Fought... Now he wants us to believe he fought. - He fought for twenty years. - Let's not exaggerate. I alternated rest and combat. I did what had to be done. Some terrible battles, counselor. An army of all kinds: horses, cannons, balls, horses, cannons, machine guns, big and small rifles, of all kinds. Men! Men! In front of me were the Cossacks lying on the ground looking at me like that. I pretended nothing happened. On the right the Mongols. Behind me were the Germans. saying, "Antonio, Jawhol!" On the left the Turks, who spoke Russian but were Turks. They said, Da da karasciò, pretending to be... Do you understand? Liar! The Turks did not fight in Russia. - You're ignorant. There were not! - They were Turks. - No, no! - They pretended to be Turks. - You dreamed them. They were Turks dressed as Russians and black, indistinguishable. So the Turks caught me. Yes, they caught me. When I was taken prisoner by the Turks, I thought I needed a ruse. I yanked them and ran away. And I started fighting. And what happened then? Who can tell? Grenades that exploded on the right, grenadines on the left, Half a soda on the other side, an ice cream cone there... You made war with sodas. With sodas and rotten lemons. - A soda? I do war with soda? - Calm down, stop it! - I'm not a soda seller. - Stop it! He scratches! - How did it end? - So in this huge fight... because it was huge... I passed out. It was chaos. I passed out and lost my memory. II got it back after 10 years. And I found myself on a snow field. And people all over the world, especially in Italy, must know that the snow in Siberia is cold! It's not average like here, where we make snowball with the hands... no. Counselor, I can't resist. It is not possible. Kill me, but I can't stand this nonsense! Counselor, he said he lost his memory for 10 years. What did he do in the other 10 years? What did you do, you beast? Don't move! What did I do? I walked from Siberia to Italy! I came on foot. Counselor, look. Did I come on foot? See, the counselor coughed. Antonio, stop it, please. Now all this belongs to the past. We must face the present. And above all the future. Counselor, try to help us. - Antonio called me a bigamist a few moments ago. - Yes. I don't know... maybe he was right. Maybe the law is against me. Wait, please. What's your name, sir? Antonio Di Cosimo, born in Tre Castagne, a Vesuvian village. - Very charming. - Yes, maybe 3 stones near Vesuvius. No, it's charming because everything is facing south. Charming my foot. That's not important. The Code is not so rigid. You just have to take and read it. Come on, show us this cod. No, there's no need. I got the code here. - Where do you have it? - Here. Here. - I can't see anything. - Let's quit kidding. Well, professor... you and your lady, - according to articles... - Counselor, would you mind sitting here? - No, that's fine. - Peppino! Well, on the basis of articles 58 and 60 of the Civil Code, did you do a declaration of presumed death? - Yes! - We wasted no time. Immediately. I myself declared him dead. - He ran there. - Very well. "Very well" my foot, counselor. I am alive! - No, it's not enough... - Shall we start over? It's not enough to be alive. You must prove it with documents. And, in our case, the presumed death sentence prove that you were dead! But that's what the presumed dead said, not me! That's right. Pursuant to Article 65, our dear, lovely, nice lady Amalia, could legitimately get married again. Not only that, but according to article 63 of the Civil Code, she could take possession of the property of the deceased. Ah, finally! So we can send this beast away! This sack of old rags. Out of this place! - I'll call the police. - One moment, professor. One moment. You may be right from a human point of view, - but you know, dear lady... - Excuse me. - Yes, dear lady... - Summum ius, summa iniuria. Excuse me, I was distracted. But this Julia... No, iniuria. It's Latin. Sorry, I thought she was Sicilian. According to articles 58, 60 and 65, you're her legitimate husband. I'm her husband! Legitimate! - But... - But... ... therefore... But therefore... according to article 68, if the dead man returns, or his existence is ascertained, the second marriage is null. Long live the counselor. Long live the 68. What a counselor! A monument should be made to him! I'll do it. - So 68 is on our side? - Of course. So we'll throw this jackal out! - Jackal, go away. - Hands down. Do not touch me. Counselor, it's not possible. There must be another article. - Do you have other articles? - Yes, in the Civil Code, but I mentioned only those that relate to our situation. Counselor, it's not possible. There must be more articles. - He brought only one item, by retail. - That's enough! Stop it! Now I speak! Counselor, the Code will settle this matter from a legal point of view, but from a human point of view, how do we do it? How can I throw it all away in five minutes ? I should take this man, my faithful and loving companion for 10 years, - and kick him out of the door? - But what do you care? The 68 entitles you to kick him. Besides, the Code declared him null. What can you do with a null? This will be decided by the court, - because we'll end up in the Supreme Court. - Anywhere you like. Oh my God, stop it! Supreme Court, courts... all these cold and inhuman laws. - But what about the law of the heart? - She's right! We must also consider the laws of the heart. I think this case is very controversial. So I have a proposition. Let's suspend the session and postpone it until tomorrow. - Yes, let's do that. - OK, the counselor is right. Let's do it tomorrow, but this beast goes away. Wherever he likes, but not im my house. Peppino, how can you say such a thing? Excuse me, but we should throw this poor fellow out in the middle of the night? Look at him. Look at him. It's a little bit his home too. No, we can't do this. Put yourself in his shoes. - Uh, for God's sake! - He'll stay here tonight. We'll manage for one night, Peppino. - OK, let him stay here, but you'll sleep with me. - No. - I'm your husband. - No, I'm her legal husband! The 68! I'm sorry, pal. I have the 68. I've been waiting for my wife for 20 years. My God, but aren't you ashamed? Gentlemen, as your legal representative, to safeguard your interests, I have a proposal. You two will stay here, and the lady, to remain neutral, will come and sleep at my house. Yeah. - Counselor! - Hey, no kidding! - Go away! - God forbid! When two fight, a third one wins! When two fight, a third one wins! Go! Go! Go. Go away. One moment. Well, as you can see, just be calm and everything falls into place. - Everything falls into place. - Antonio, you who have suffered years of deprivation - and have always slept on the ground... - Keep sleeping on the ground. - On the ground? - Sleep standing up. - Am I a horse? - Never mind. Peppino, is this your hospitality? - Antonio, you'll sleep in the bed. - In the bed. You in the bed and you'll sleep on the sofa. - Me, on the sofa? And you? - And you? - Shut up! - And you? I said it first. - And you? I'll sleep in the study, alone! - No, no, no, no. - What... No, no, no, no. I can't let you do it. God forbid. Amalia, why that? So my arrival in this house would upset your habits. - Not a chance. - So what? - I'd have an idea. - What? - I like it. - It must please all of us. - I like it, frankly. - Say it. Come with me. Amalia, what is your usual place in this marriage bed? - That. - That. - Amalia is a woman. - I know. - She's a woman? - Can't you see it? - So she takes her place. OK? I'll lie on this side. The professor will lie down horizontally. Sure, he's a foot blanket. A heating pad. - Should we put you under the bed? - Yes, I'm a slipper. Oh! So I have to change the whole idea. Amalia will move to this side. And... this sort of professor... will take Amalia's place. - And I'll sleep in the middle. - In the middle. See? I must stay in the middle. I come from Siberia. I'm like an iron curtain. I watch over my interests. Where do you get these crazy ideas? These are inadmissible filthy things. - Filthy? These things aren't practiced in Abyssinia! - Inadmissible! I have to watch over my interests because I'm the only legal husband! - Hey! - I have to watch over. I have to watch over too! No kidding! - Gentlemen... - ... Tickets, please? Are we on a tram?! But what are you talking about? "I have to watch over..." Watch over yourselves, if you like! I got annoyed with your scenes. Did you get that? - Good night! - Wait, Lietta! I'm coming too. - Leave it. - OK. - You can't get through there - And you can't either. - Yes. Get back inside! Stand over here! Look at him... He give orders. - We'll sleep together. - We will. - OK? - After Siberia, I have to sleep with you too. - I can't take it anymore. - Mamma Mia! - What is it? Oh, yes. It's the scent of the steppe. I'll sleep with my shoes on. I'm telling you in advance. There we go. - What are you doing? - I said my prayers. - That's the way you say them? - Everyone has his own way. - OK. - What are you doing now? - I'm coming to sleep. - No. - Lo Cosimo, no. - Why not? - Not under the covers. - And where do I sleep? - Above. I won't sleep under the covers with a beast. - But I have to sleep. - I'm sorry. Then I'm going to sleep with Amalia. OK. - But above. - I'll sleep above. Also because I'm a little warm. Professor, I can't sleep in the dark. - I have nightmares of the ghosts... - So what? of the dead of Siberia. Turn on the light. Thank you. Excuse me. That's life. Who'd have thought? Having to withstand all bad weather. What a man! Crossing Siberia, Russia, Germany on foot. And here I am at my house. This is the world. No, that's not the world. - What? - It's not the world. - Well, if you say so. - I say so. Professor, professor? - Are you sleeping? - Holy patience. Professor, do me a favor, please. Can you scratch my back? I should scratch your back? Lo Cosimo, are you crazy? - Then I'll have Amalia scratch it. - No. One moment. Where is the itch? Scratch hard. Don't you have nails? - I don't. - I feel soft fingers. - He took me for an octopus. - Ah, good. - Is there anything? - I guess so. - What? - I guess so. But at this hour... they're sleeping. I can't sleep. Sorry! Did I hurt you? What are you doing? Hey! - What are you doing? - Professor? What are you doing?! - Nothing, it's you who turned me upside down. - Me? I can't sleep. That's it. Alright? Alright? That's it. - Are you walking? - I am. Do you mind? - On the bed? - And where? On the ground? - What is it, the Riviera? - I'm used to walking on the beds. Rooms in Russia are small and people walk on the beds. But not on my bed. No! - Then I'll go to Amalia. Where shall I go? - No! - OK. - Ugh. Stay here. Tomorrow will come. Professor, I want to go there. - What's there? - Nothing. I wanna stay there for a while. What's there, a bar? Mamma mia, my leg! I twisted it. Where? Again! He takes this for a horse track. - Where? I'll give you a massage. - Leave me alone! Lo Cosimo, leave me alone! What a night! Hey! So what?! Two pillows are too many. - Who is it? - If you don't stop... - Professor, do you have a tranquilizer? - No. A tranquilizer... - Oh my God, right on my... - That's why I couldn't sleep. Now I get it. Did you understand why I couldn't sleep? - Who is it? - "Who is it..." Professor, excuse me. - What is this, an eviction? - Eviction... What'd you do? Am I supposed to sleep with that one? I'm used to it. We all sleep like this in Russia. If I don't feel him over my head, I can't sleep. OK, let's leave him there. It's a nervous thing. - But let's sleep. - Let's sleep. Anyway, tomorrow I'm going to court. Do my shoes bother you? Well? - But... - You know, the more I look at you, the more I'm convinced that you're not ugly at all. Go, go away! - So I'm going to Amalia. - One moment. - Let's sleep. - Let's sleep. I need a solution. The law is against me. Justice doesn't help me. I need a special judge. A righteous judge. An impartial judge. Who can it be? Only Solomon. Only Solomon... Solomon... May justice be done. Let the two contenders speak. Listen, Solomon, you who are very good in the administration of justice, free me from this mess. Do you think this is the right time to disturb Salamon? - Solomon! - Exactly, I said. That's what I said... disturb Solomon at this time. Professor, he looks like a familiar face to me. I've already seen him. - Silence! - Let the judgment begin. - Well, Solomon... - Wait. - Here I am. - Speak up. That woman is mine. - She's my wife, I swear on that flame. - It's me who decides. He's the one who has to decide, do you understand? How beautiful! Professor, this Salmon looks like a familiar face to me. Excuse me if I insist. I think I've seen him before. Amazing. Beautiful. Wonderful. - Strip her down. - No, I object! I object too! Shut up, I am Solomon. - No! - Poor girl, put a leaf on her! Don't look at my wife! She's my wife. Beautiful. - What is he doing? - I don't know. Can't you see? - Magnificent! Awesome! - I understand all. - What? - I don't know. - Amalia, speak. What did he understand? - A sword! I'll cut her in two pieces. I'll give a piece to one husband and a piece to the other. Tell me, how would you cut her? - Like this! - No! No! Not like this. It's cruel. I'd say, let's cut her like this. We'll give the top piece to the professor, who really wants it. I'll take the bottom piece. No, no! Solomon, no! I love her so much that I prefer to give her entirely to my rival, but save her life. - You've read the Bible, Castagnano. - You've read the bill of the chestnuts! - And you're trying to screw me. - See? Well, Salami, who do you give her to? - This is my righteous sentence. - Let's cut her. As king of Jerusalem and to safeguard your common interests, I won't give her to either of you. - No? So what? - I'll take her. - No! - But this is Vacchi! It's the counselor! You swine, I won't take her! I'll strangle you! Solomon, you're in my hands! Vacchi, you wretch! Come here! Solomon? Vacchi? Where are they? They're gone. Uh! He's gone too! He screwed me! He went to Lietta. Hell, now I'll fix you! Ah, I caught you both! It's over for you two! Lo Cosimo, I caught you! Out! Where is Lo Cosimo? - Where is he? - What's going on? - What goes in your head? - Many things. What were you doing hugging this pillow? - Who did it represent for you? Tell me! - Let me sleep. - Who did this pillow represent for you? - A pillow. Yes, a pillow in a woman's fantasy can represent many things. In this case, who did it represent for you? Me or Lo Cosimo? Tell me! I want the truth at all costs! - Tell me. - Peppino, let me sleep. I told you to tell me the truth! Well? - Do you want the truth? - Yes, who did it represent? Do you want to know who it represented? Marlon Brando! Oh yes? Marlon Brando? It's no time to joke. I must go to school, bloody hell! I have to find him. Where is this cursed stateless person? That veteran, that stinker! I'm gonna find you. Where are you, stinker? I'm gonna find you. What is it? Hey! Occupied! - Ah, you're here! Hurry up, I have to wash! - Wait. I have my timetable! A poor man can't be comfortable in his own house... An idiot like this comes along... Hey! And I don't have my timetable? I'd like to know who let him in there. It was probably Prassede. Prassede! How soon you'll be here? Five minutes? OK, I'll be right down. - Professor, your mail and newspaper. - Thank you. Professor! Professor. The bathroom is unoccupied. Got it? - Where do we eat? - In the kitchen. As long as we eat. Prassede! - What are you looking at? - Is he a relative? What, relative. Does he have the face of a relative? - He's a friend of my maid. - And he slept here? Yes. I let whoever I like sleep in my house, even my maid's friends. - Go, go. - OK. Walk away. Maid's friends... Oh no, my darling, you don't fool me. You must tell me who slept with you last night, because the whole building knows you have a friend. What? Are you crazy? No, I'm not. Even the doorman said so. - And he saw him too. - But who did he see? When? When? He saw your friend. The one that was with you last night. - My friend? - Yes, your friend. - But that's not my friend. - Who is he then? - He's one who... - One who...? Come on, say it! No, I swore to the lady. Let's speak plainly once and for all. Once and for all! Until a contrary and final judgment, I am her husband. So I've decided, by Jove... that my wife won't be home alone... won't be home alone... with a beast, while I'm at school! At school? You go to school? At your age? - Well? - Aren't you ashamed? You donkey, ignorant! You're donkey! You don't understand. I go to school to teach. Teach... He ate four eggs. Four! Come on, that's enough! Come to school with me. Me? What are you saying? Speak clearly! I didn't go to school as a child, and now with you... Please, go away! Stop eating. You're worse than a hungry wolf. - Come on! - Don't joke around! Lo Cosimo, stop it. I pay for the food. Professor, what did you say? - What did I say? - You said that I slept with this gentleman last night. So my boyfriend left me. How dare you make such insinuations? This is an outrageous slander! I have a perfect alibo. I slept with you last night. Is it clear? Professor, please come and tell my boyfriend that's not true. Eh! I should be a peacemaker too! Are you kidding me? I'm in a lot of trouble myself! I have to go to school. It's 8:00 and it's late! Amalia, Lietta, get ready! Come to school with me. - The lady isn't here. - Where did she go? - I should say it! I must say "where did she go". I'm her husband! - And who am I? - What do I know? - We'll see it! - We will. Well, where did she go? I don't know. She said she was going out. She's fed up with you two. Listen, please tell my boyfriend that's not true. Are you kidding? Go do the housework! Do you hear? I must go to school with him! Professor, you don't fool me. I come from Siberia. I am an adopted Siberian! How can I be sure that you didn't agree before with my wife, to send me away and screw me over? One moment. How can I be sure that you two didn't agree before to send me away and screw me over? - Come on, come to school with me! - Right away. - Hurry up. - I'll get my uniform and fur hat. Not those rags. - Rags? - Don't come to my school with those tires, foot wraps and that fur hat full of fleas. No! There are little girls there. Give me some of your clothes. Shoes, socks, garters, underwear, a shirt, two sweaters. You want a trousseau. Are you kidding? Are you getting married? OK, just one sweater. Well, girls, all your comments are useless. I understand you. I understand what you're saying. He's old, ugly, horrible and has flat feet. I understand, but he's your assistant. Ad you must respect him for that. Hey, but they didn't even talk. Yes, but they thought so. I know these girls. Well, where's Bernabei? - Bernabei! Where's Bernabei? - I'm here. - Are you Bernabei? - No, I'm a friend of the Bernabeis. - Stay here and shut up. - He was at war with me. - Well... - I'm here, professor. Bernabei. Bernabei, dear and good girl. Well, Bernabei, where did we stop yesterday in reading... in reading The Betrothed? Chapter 11, professor. - Very good! - Holy cow! - Very good, Bernabei! I'm sorry. - No problem. In this chapter Manzoni introduces the character of Don Rodrigo. May I? - Stand up! - What is it? Stay seated. - Professor, good morning. - Who is he? - The president. - Who? - Mr. president. I need to talk to you. But who is the gentleman? - Don't you know me? - I don't. - You don't remember me. - Have we met before? I never met you, but you must have seen me many times. - Where? - In the newspapers. I'm a veteran. - Veteran? - Yes, Mr. presbyopic, look... - I'm no presbyopic. - But you wear glasses. So what? I'm wearing them because I can't see well. - So you're presbyopic? - I'm no presbyopic! - Are you myopic? - Mr. president, not presbyopic. - You've mistaken my name. - He misunderstood. - I apologize for him. - Don't worry. You said you're a veteran? Yes, but he meant that he made many tours of inspection, Mr. President. He's my assistant and of course I pay him. Professor, I need to talk to you face to face. - And the pupils? - The pupils, what? - The girls. What better opportunity? Your assistant can handle this. - You mean him? - Sure. Let's go. - Will he come right back? - Of course, I'll be right back. Because I have to watch him. In the meantime, you could do it. - I don't understand. - Don't let him go away. - He meant... Let me speak. - I'd like to understand something. - He meant to watch the time. - Ah! - If you watch the time. - Of course. - I don't have to worry? - You don't. - Neither do I. - Nice meeting you, Mr... Lo Cosimo. With a small C. - Stand up! - No, stay seated, girls. Stay seated! Well? Where are we? Silence! What is this shouting? Holy cow! I'll write your names! I'll mark you! Holy cow! I'm writing the good and the bad girls. Like this. B-a-d. Hot [Good] Now walk before me one at a time. Come on. Hurry up! Who are you waiting for? Pingo? Come on, who's first? Here we go. Are you the first? You're the first? You're very good. I see it in your eyes. I'm an ophthalmic. I see in your eyes that you're good. Good... Let's not exaggerate. One should know how to treat you. And I know it. And, if treated in the right way... I mean, the right way, you're the goodness personified. What's wrong, professor? - I brought my assistant here. - I saw him. I left him alone with the girls. I'm afraid he'll get nervous and do something wrong. - No, what might happen? - You say he won't do anything? - No, those girls are so good. - Precisely. - They're so good. - What might happen? Chest out. Like this. Very good. Stomach in. - Turn around. - But professor... If I tell you to turn around, you have to turn around. Do you hear me? I'm the assistant and I have to assist. Come on. - Very good. What's your name?. - Thea. Go sit down. Thea with the "H"? Thea. Who is it?! What kind of joke is this? You don't look like a good girl! But I'm the class leader. I have a 4.0 average. - I'll show you! - But professor... I'm the assistant. Everything I say is right. OK? - But... - Go stand in the corner! - Stay here and don't say a word! - Professor... - Look at that! - Damn. You're setting a bad example. Damn, what? You're contaminating the classmates! Look at that! Are you kidding? Well, girls, given that in this classroom there are good and nice girls, let's move on. It would take a cloth to erase, but there isn't. No matter, because this is a double sided chalkboard. What?! Professor Castagnano is a cuckold. Who dared to write this obscenity?! - Who? - We don't know it. Maybe the boys did it. 10th-grade boys enter here at recess. Silence! I don't tolerate such insinuations! Not for the professor's honor, which I don't give a damn about, - but for my wife's honor! - What's your wife got to do with it? She has something to do with it because she's not the professor's wife, but she's my wife. Besides, why are you interfering? Who questioned you?! - But professor... - You're grounded! Get out! - But professor... - Do you hear me? Get out! And don't make me angry, otherwise I'll get furious! I got furious! I'm getting furious! Do you hear me? I'm locking someone in this morning! Good girls, very good! And I, fool... and I say fool, I've been deceived by your external beauty. You make me laugh. You make me laugh! But I'll find out which bosom hides the viper. Come on, get your boso... get the viper out! For God's sake! Come on, hurry up. Now, and I say now, take a drawing paper. What are you waiting for?! Come on. - You've got it? - Yes. - All of you? - Yes. - Very well. Now copy everything that's written on that blackboard. Words, drawing and horns included! After that, I'll do a handwringing analysis, and I'll find out the bosom that hides the viper. Hey! - What happened? - Your assistant, professor. Your assistant? - What did he do? - He kicked me out. How is that possible? You're top of the class. First he said that Professor Castagnano's wife is his wife and then he kicked me out. Castagnano's wife is his wife? Professor, what is this mess? Mr. president, it's not possible. Maybe she misunderstood. She has poor eyesight. - Look, she doesn't see my hand. - Yes, but she has good hearing. - Can you hear us? - Yes, professor. Well? Come on, explain it to me. Mr. president, be so kind to wait for me here. - I'm going to see what this meddler has done. - No! Some outrageous things have been said and I too want to find out the truth. - Please, walk ahead of me. - OK. Let's see... No, it doesn't match. Here his nose is shorter. It's longer there. Next. And so is this. This one has shorter horns. He has them longer. No. What's going on? I'm investigating. A handwringing analysis. You know they called you a cuckold? And if they call you a cuckold, they dishonor my wife Do you know? Look how they treated you. Professor, please. Step aside, professor! - This is you? - Yes... no. But what a mess! - Professor, please, explain it to me. - Yes. What did he say? Speak clearly, please! - It's a very sensitive matter. - I want to know it. It's not true that she's his wife, she's mine! No, Mr. presbyopic. Listen to me. You know, Mr. presbyopic... Again, presbyopic! President, please. President! Yes, but there's one point I want to clarify. Let's clarify it. The real and legitimate husband of the professor's wife, it's me! - It's his fixation. - Professor, please. I hate to say this, but here there's something not very clean. - You noticed - For a long time. - But I smell it. Yes. But we need to clarify, professor. - And let's clarify. - Not here. Let's not upset the innocence of these girls. But give me a break! - Mr. presbyterian... - Presbyterian... - Mr. presbyterian... - President! These girls know a lot about of these things. Each of them, keep it between us, in her bosom, hides a viper with a head and a tail. - I saw it. - What are you saying? What a liar! - Everything must be explained. - When? In front of the girls, otherwise I'll make a bad impression. - You already make it. - Yes, sure. The girls should know that this guy, this beast who came from Russia, arbitrarily claims rights to my wife. - Professor! - So help me God, she's my wife! - Please, shut up! - Shut up! - You're going crazy too! - You too. - Shh... silence. - Gesundheit. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Ladies, please leave the classroom. - No, one moment. - Why not? Nobody move from here. - Why? - There's an ongoing investigation. - Investigation? - Are you still here?! - Go away! - Professor! - How many times I got to tell you?! - What are you doing? Are you crazy? He puts the key in his pocket! Give me that key. - Give me that key. - No. He said no. He said no! And you're just standing there. "He said no!" - What should I do, eat him? - What kind of a man are you?! Do something! I'll handle this. Janitor! Open the door! There's a crazy man here. Get me out! Let's run away from the window! Open up! Bernabei, call the janitor immediately! - Bernabei, don't move! - But professor! - What's going on? - He said there's a madman inside. We must break the door down. Ah, finally. Take him away. - Take him away! - Where? - One moment. - Take him away! - I have to watch him. - Go to hell! I have to watch him! How can I tell you it's over? I don't care about you anymore. Got it? I don't care about you either. But I don't want you to think I'm a dirty girl. You must come and talk to the lady, do you hear me? And what should she tell me? That she has two husbands? Yes, she has two husbands. She thought one was dead. He came back from Russia last night. Is that OK? - So she has two husbands? - Yes! - And how she does it? - Eh, how.... You can't even imagine the noise at home. Consider that the professor was fired from school. And they also called a priest. - Why, is he dying? - Nah! Don Ignazio celebrated the marriage between the lady and the professor, so they hope he can find a solution. For you. No, my son, no. - It's not as easy as you think. - No? Before you two got here, Mrs Amalia told me that the facts are different from what the counselor said. - What do you mean? - Anzi, there's a small detail that will greatly affect future decisions. Amalia, what is this detail? Speak, hurry up! I'm nervous, I'm getting anzio! There's something I hadn't thought of when the counselor was here, because I didn't know it mattered that much. - Amalia, but... - Excuse me. - Amalia... - Amalia, excuse me... - Shall we talk at the same time? - Go ahead. - Yes, I will. - Go ahead, professor. - Yes, professor, and bite your tongue! - Sit down! - Give me a break. - Don't push me! - I didn't. - You did! - That's not true! - You're a liar too. - Come on, you're acting like kids! If I put my hands on him, I get them dirty. - Souls of my dead, help me. - Sit down. - And he pushed me again. - You don't know him. I do. - Well, Amalia what is... - I know him. - I'll scratch your eyes out! - Me? - Can I talk or not? - He wants to scratch my eyes out. - He's a liar. - Calm down, please. Well, what is the detail you told Father Ignazio? - Antonio, do you remember we got married in Naples? - Yes. Late, because we were waiting for the dispensation, since she was minor, very young. As soon as the dispensation arrived, we got married there. Right? Yes, we got married in Naples and after the ceremony we took the train to Rome. But what does it matter? May I finish speaking? Do you remember what happened with the railway police? Why are you telling these things? - They checked all men. - Yes. He hid in the toilet because he wasn't in compliance with military service. Ah! He wasn't in compliance with military service! In 1942. Our hero! And he tells those stories... about Savoy! Oh yes? And you were in compliance? - Yes, I was. - Go away, please! - Please! - I was a volunteer in anti-aircraft defense. - Yes? And where did you fight? - In the city, under the bombing. Hidden in an office! Did you hear, Don Ignazio? Under the bombing. In short, Antonio received many draft cards from the district. But I never answered. Don't tell me you reply to every postcard you receive. Give me a break! Of course I was pleased that the district remembered me and wrote to me, but I didn't know that... Ah! So he evaded answering to the district chief. If I didn't know him, why did I have to answer him? - And I wasn't an evader. - Peppino! I'm not an evader, for God's sake! Let this be known! - I said evaded. - You are evaded! - Can I talk? - He doesn't understand anything. - No? The important fact is another. The important fact is - that when we arrived at the Rome station... - Yes. I got off the train and from that moment I never saw my husband again. Of course, while I was hiding in the toilet, they grabbed me and brought me to the front. They dressed me in 20 days and sent to the front line where I used to shoot the enemy. And the enemy remembers me because I was a tough cookie. Don Igna', so when they married they didn't... - My son. - That's why I... - Don Igna', Don Igna'... - Don Na Na... Speak clearly! - Let me talk. - Don Ignazio. This is the classic case of a marriage rato e non consumato. Oh, are you happy? Very good. But it's you who has not consumed it. Okay, but I can consume it whenever I want. As the word itself says. Rata means that I can consume it in installments. No, rato, ratified. That means a marriage celebrated in its external forms and absolutely valid, but not perfected by that union thanks to which no one can divide spouses anymore. OK, I'll make it perfect now. Amalia, get ready! But Don Ignazio... My son, this is one of the very rare cases in which the Church, by the hand of the Sacra Rota, - can dissolve a marriage. - They can dissolve it? Ah, they can! So this sack of old rags can go away? Give me my dress and goodbye, article 68. - Should I undress in front of Don Ignazio? - My son, I said that the Sacra Rota could dissolve a marriage, but it's a matter of conscience and only the lady can decide. I can help her, but it's up to her to decide. Don Ignazio, what should I do? Blessed daughter, if your heart tells you to choose Antonio, that you've married regularly, you can make this union indissoluble... by perfecting it. Bravo, Don Ignazio. You'll make a career. They'll make you captain, I'm telling you. I told you we had to make it perfect. - Amalia, here we go! - Go where?! Antonio, stop it, please. Don Ignazio, maybe you're right, but do you think it's easy? When I think I should choose Antonio, I look around and I see many memories that bind me to Peppino. Amalia, you're right. It would bother me too. Listen to me. I have a great idea. You and I are going on a trip. Yes, so we move away from this house and these people. Do you remember that little mountain hotel where we get engaged? You know... let's go there and one thing leads to another... Yes? Yes? What do you think? Well? - Well, maybe you... - Attagirl! What, attagirl?! Is that a joke? Don Ignazio, come on! The mountain hotel, the engagement... and you nod your head. - But I'm a respectable professor. - Stay calm. If the trip to the mountains will help her to take... the big step, after all she'll be with her wedded husband and would not do it rashly. Eh, no. No, it would be really demeaning. My daughter, before making this decision, don't be afraid to tell yourself 10, 20, 100 or 1000 times what am I doing? What am I doing? What am I... Don Igna', what are you doing, excuse me? You have to give only a brief outline of things, but you bring up doubts. Why? He must do it. That's exactly why we called him. To bring doubts. To bring trouts? Who is he, a fisherman? - Doubts! - Peppino, I've made a decision. I have to take a trip with Antonio. You have to let me. Come on, will you? - He will. - I will. One moment, we're forgetting the most important thing. There are many expenses. The mountain hotel, the trip, room and board... - The tips. -The tips. - The tips are big there. - And who pays? - And who pays? - He! - Me? Why, should I? Professor... I will. My love, how romantic. Look. The same sky as twenty years ago. The same trees. The same mountains. Yes, now the mountains change. What kind of talk... Professor, don't ruin the atmosphere, please. Ours is love talk. We're cooing here. Peppino, I don't understand why you wanted this unnecessary torment. We had to, but you could stay home. Sure, I had to stay home without knowing what was going on here. Do you realize that all my happiness depends on this? Besides, you could've found a cheaper place. And, most importantly, less cold. Cold? Did he say cold. Professor, are you kidding? It's just 7 degrees below 0. I'd say this a torrid, equatorial climate. My love, I don't know if it's because I'm used to the Siberian climate, but being close to you, I'm on fire. I burn. I feel boiling. Professor, you may not believe it, but if you make me an egg and put it in my hand, I'll make it soft-boiled. Yeah, he mistaken me for a hen. Amalia, let yourself go. Oh my God, what am I doing? What am I doing? What... And what are you doing, my darling? Whenever a little mood is created, this "what am I doing" ruins everything. You're absolutely right, but remember what Don Ignazio told me. I have to ask myself 10, 20, 100, 1000 times. But you've already said it 945 times. Let yourself go. What are you doing? Take it away! - Who ordered this? - The husband of that lady. The husband of that lady... I am her husband. Excuse me, but who is that gentleman? That one? He's a family friend. Oh, mind your business. - A family friend. - Don't make any allusions! By Jove, you're making allusions! I wanna talk to the manager. - But... - I wanna talk to the manager! Where is he? I'll fix you good! Call the manager. This professor is a yokel. Where do you think you are?! - What's going on, Peppino? - Ah, finally. Professor, you're ruining the atmosphere that I'm creating in order to consume. You’re not keeping your end. He sets the mood but the waiters are starting to hint. - But who is her husband? - Who knows. They both say they are. - One moment - Stop it! - Let's go to the bar! - He'll buy me a drink. Come on. - Don't bother me. Go, go. - Who does the lady sleep with? - We don't know. How can it be? They asked for two adjoining rooms. Both "husbands" said they wanted to sleep with her, but this morning the waitress of that floor found the husbands sleeping together. Together? In the same bed! - In the same bed? - Yes. No! I'll take care of those two! - Excuse me, I'd like to talk to you. - Are you an officer? Don't you recognize me? I'm the hotel manager. Oh, yes. I sent for you. Listen, you must immediately fire a waiter who dared to make allusions about me! It's not just the waiter who makes allusions about you. - Who else? - Don't raise your voice. - No, I will. - No, you won't! - But I already did. - And you did wrong. You claim to be the husband of the lady traveling with you Of course. Well, look there. Russian style. Infallible system. Like this. Hey! Karasho! - And I pay. - He breaks and you pay. - He breaks things and I pay. - Speak softly. It's better to sit down, sir. Standing doesn't help reasoning. - It's better to clarify. - Sure. - Let's clarify. - Don't worry, sir. He's a relative of my wife. A madman. You don't believe it? - Yes. - He thinks he's my wife's husband. Imagine that! What a misfortune in my family. We had him seen by many good doctors. Nothing. He can't be cured. It's a strange but harmless disease. - Thank God. So in bed... - She sleeps alone! No, I don't mean her. I mean you. Ah, I sleep with him. - What did you understand? - Forget it. - Forget it, what? - Forget it. - I'll call the owner! - Not so loud! - It's embarrassing. I'm a professor. - Speak softly. Will you make up your mind? Time flies. What do we do? - I can't make up my mind. - Why not? - Because I'm drunk. - No. - And if you were, that would be better. Got it? - Why, better? But who are you sleeping with tonight? - Me? I'll sleep alone. - And me? With Peppino! He should die. What are you doing at night? Quarrels, noises. You two scream like mad. - Scream? He's sick! - See, you're screaming too. - It's my nerves. - I know. It's the nerves, but I can't tolerate such chaos. My clients all play sports. Do you see them? They're all climbers, dear sir. People who need to sleep peacefully at night, because in the morning they need to be relaxed and with firm muscles. There are some very difficult mountain walls to climb. The famous north-west face, sixth grade. It doesn't forgive mistakes. Just one foot wrong, or a moment of distraction... blew... it's death. That wall doesn't forgive. - Doesn't forgive? - No, it doesn't. So I... - What if it does? - But it doesn't. A tremendous wall. So I'm telling you... - Don face...? - What don? North-west face! - I understood Don Ernesto. - What, Don Ernesto? So be careful what you'll do or I... The north-west face doesn't forgive. Maybe this is the solution. The north-west face doesn't forgive. It doesn't forgive. ♪ On the mountains On the mountains that we will be on ♪ ♪ We'll pick We'll pick edelweiss ♪ - Sing, Lo Cosimo. - Sing, my foot! You should've told me before that to do the experiment we had to come to this attic at 3000 meters high. - What are you saying, Antonio? - Look there. - It's a spectacle. - What a view. It was a wonderful idea to come here. Look at the view. It's a splendor. We really have to thank Peppino. How beautiful the edelweiss are. - Look, a bunch of edelweisses. - Where? Down there. Look, my dear. How lovely! - Come on, pick them. - Pick them. - Are you crazy? - Why? Down there, at 2000 meters high. There's an abyss there. - But it's a crevice. - That's a crevasse. - It's a small crest. - Let's leave the crest where it is. Too bad, it would have been a demonstration of your love for Lietta. Guys, I'm going back to the hotel. - Wait. - No, Antonio. we have arrived. - Auf wiedersehen. - We've arrived at the cave. - Yes? - I'll wait here. - We're steps away. Keep it. We're steps away. I'll wait here. We're steps away. You lazy couch potato. Maybe I am, but I'll wait here. The guidebook says this is a very interesting cave. Antonio, come and see. This cave is wonderful. - Walk close to the wall. - Close to it? - Yes. Besides, I'm right behind you. - There's no danger? - No. Come on, go. - You know, because... Be careful. God damn it! That was close. - You almost fell? - You bet. - And you didn't fall? - No, why? - Nothing. - Are you sorry? - There's a banana peel? - How do you know that? - Maybe there was a banana peel. - Yeah. Some idiot ate a banana and threw the peel on the ground. - It's lovely. Antonio, hurry up! - Lietta is calling you. - It's slippery. - Tie yourself to the rope. - And who will tie me up? - I will. - No? Sure? - Of course. - Can you hold me? - Of course, I can. Are you kidding? - Word of honor? - We're almost related. - I mean, we have a shared interest. - Yes. - Isn't it? - Tie me up. - I'll do it. - Hold me tight. - I'll bind your hands and feet. - What? I mean around your waist. - My waist. Not hands and feet. - Hands and feet must be free. Free. The waist is important. There's even an echo! - Go. - Can you hold me? - Of course. - Tight. Go, otherwise the proof is worthless. You have to go alone. Professor, there's plenty of banana peels. - A banana vendor has been here. - Never mind. Tight. - Where are you? - I'm here. Come. - I can't run. It's slippery. - I know. - It's all snow. - You can't imagine how beautiful it's here. Professor, are you holding tight? Yes. - Hold tight. - Yes. My dear, thank you. - You really gave me a great proof of love. - Did I? I only did it for you, my love. - Ah, what a nice place. - Look, I don't know if it's the legend of this place, or your charm, but here in this cave I really feel that... I love you in this cave [grotta], in Fuorigrotta, in Piedigrotta. Everywhere! - Professor, are you holding me? - Yes! - Professor, still tight? - Yes. Do you hear the echo? - But it's Peppino's voice! - No, it's the echo. Help! I'm falling! Wha a big precipice! - What happened, Peppino? - Help me? Professor, what are you doing? This is no time to joke. Come up, don't be ridiculous. I'm not kidding, you moron! I'm on the precipice! Do something or it will all be over between us! - Professor. - Yes? - I have an idea. - Yes. Tell me if you like it. I like it. If you like it, I mean, if you agree, make me a sign with both hands, like this. - Jerk! - Can you hear me? - We're going to the hotel now. - Yes. This evening, after dinner, we'll organize an expedition to save you. We'll be here tomorrow. Make sure you're still there! Do you think we're at the playground? You beast! You murderer, damned veteran! If you're no longer there, it would be the will of the Divine Providence. Maybe because of Don Ignazio, I don't know. Don Ignazio shouldn't have done that to me. Save me! Throw a rope! Stop it. Take this rope and throw it at him. We'll bring him up. Hurry up! Move it! Now I'll throw it. Move away. Don't throw it! Tie it to a rock first. To a rock? Professor, do I have to tie it? Hurry up, I've got stomach cramps! Well... A rock? Be careful because there are wobbling rocks. Don't worry, I'll handle this. - Got it? - Yes. - I've found a great one. - Tie it tightly. - This holds your weight. - OK! This is a huge stone. Alright, so I don't have to worry. Absolutely. And neither do I, professor. Peppino, hold on. It's almost done. Done! Here's the rope. - Professor, shall I throw it to you? - Yes! Be careful. Throw it. I missed it, oh my God! - Did you grab it? - I grabb... Oh my God! Antonio! Amalia, I'm dying! Help! Call the Red Cross! - Help! - I'll say it, not you. - Help! - And what should I say? - I don't know. - Help! - I'll ask for help for myself. Help! - Lietta! - - A rescue team! - You murderer! - You wanted to kill me! - Yes, yes. - Cuckold! - Me? - Don't offend your wife. - Lietta! - Help! - Oh my God! - Saint Bernard dogs! Mountain guides! - Help me! - You damn beast! Help me! - I'll make you fall into the abyss! - Help, he's killing me! - Into the abyss! - What's going on? - Into the abyss. - Help! That's enough, gentlemen, you've crossed the line! You're ruining my hotel. Stop it! I can't stand you anymore! Come on, don't you have any manners? What's going on? What did you two do? - Castagnaro... - What you've done now? - He wanted to choke me. - What? - I'm bruised. - No! it isn't true! It was a nightmare. Nightmare or not, you must leave the hotel immediately! Yes, let's leave this hotel and go straight back to Rome. You drove me crazy! VILLA LA QUIETE CLINIC - Thank you. - Now you better go away. Don't tire the lady because she needs a lot of rest. One more minute, professor. - What are those two doing? Have they calmed down? - Yes, quite. - Do they still fight? - Yes, sometimes. No, they almost never meet. When one arrives, the other leaves. When one goes out, the other follows him. I don't understand what they're doing. Ma'am, that's why I came here. You have to go home as soon as possible. - What? - Nino, what are you saying? What are you saying? The lady is very exhausted. She needs a long rest. Yeah, so my poor girlfriend has to stay at home with two men. I can't allow it. I'm sorry, but I'll get her to change jobs Ugh, you always overreact. Ma'am, don't mind him. Yes, Nino, don't worry. My two husbands have other things to think about. Believe me. Ma'am, take it from me. When wives are away, husbands have only one thing in mind. ♪ Oh sexy ♪ ♪ Sexy dream ♪ ♪ Oh sexy ♪ ♪ Sweet and sexy ♪ ♪ It's a fever that devours, anguishes, burns ♪ ♪ Grabs and drags you ♪ This is a big thing. She's perfect. - Dear professor, when I choose, I choose well. - Yes. What a... But will she accept? I'm worried. I'm afraid my wife will leave the clinic and start over with Don Ignazio's experiment. No doubt. I've already used that girl. Separations, adultery. Always in strictly legal cases. I've already talked to Jeannette. - It's just a question of price. - I'll pay. But look, what we're doing is unorthodox. So you must give me your word as a gentleman that you won't tell anyone, especially your wife, that I helped you. Of course. You know how much I care about your wife, don't you? - Word of honor. - OK. Wow! ♪ Life is all sexy ♪ ♪ Love is just sexy ♪ She's gorgeous. Good boy. If all private detectives were like you, I'd hire you for life, believe me. But what are you looking at? - We have another target. - Well? You hired me to follow Professor Castagnano. - Well? - And I followed him here. - And where is he? - There. - Hey! He's with his counselor. I guess his counselor serves him as... I understand everything. He too is... Well, from bad to worse. Did you see? That wretched man, while his wife is in the clinic, poor thing, he's having fun with hussies. I think my work is done. Here's the bill. And what should I do? Me? God forbid. Put it in an envelope and send it to Professor Castagnaro. Excuse me, but Professor Castagnano is the guy I tailed. - Well? - It's absurd that he has to pay. I know it sounds absurd, but there it is. There's an agreement between me and the professor. Understood? OK, I'll talk to my boss. Good evening. I'll fix you good. I'll show you now. - Good evening, counselor. - Good evening, miss. Hello? Am I speaking to La Quiete clinic? Is the clinic quiet? Good evening, doctor. I'm the husband of the lady at number 18. What do you mean, who? The hero! Look, this is very urgent. I need my wife out of there. It's impossible. She must not be disturbed. It's my responsibility and I'll never allow... What? Don't be vulgar, please! And you don't make me lose my patience! I need my wife to come to the Gatto Verde immediately so she can see for herself how false and hypocritical her second husband is, the so-called Castagnano. I don't get orders from anyone, least of all from you. This is not a hotel, but a clinic. She's under my care and will only come out when I say so. Alright? Hello? Hello, doctor? Doctor? "Doctor" so to speak... Nothing works in this country, not even doctors. I need a witness. How can I do it? How can I do it? - Miss, my coat. - We can go to my place, if you like. - I'd be glad. Where do you live? - Via Fieramosca 21. Fieramosca 21. We can go with my car. - I'd love to. - Thanks. -You first. - Thanks. Via Fieramosca 21. I need a witness. What a fool I am. I have a witness: Prassede. Professor, I'll show you what it means to deal with a veteran. Well, miss, you're regularly remunerated. - What does remunerated mean? - Paid. I want to prove to my wife that he's not worthy of her. - What can we do? - There're two ways. The fragrance or the photography. It's just a question of price. Of course, it's always a question of price. A little here, a little there and the savings go away. Damn! What does photography mean? - Ah! But the counselor didn't tell you anything? - No. Either you bring your wife here and she catches me with that sucker or there is the photo system: one takes a pic and sends it to her. Oh yes? And I should pay for this? What a system! He's not dumb. He sees the photographer and gets suspicious Dumb... He looks dumb but he's smart. But where you come from? It's all organized. We stay here and the photographer in the other room. - There's a hole. - A hole? - Yes. - Look, the hole is there. - Where? - It's there but you can't see it. Look! - If you can't see it, I can't see it. It's there, but you can't see it. We have arrived. Prassede, hurry up and come. Here I am. Hurry up, come in! - How much is it? - 4.50. This is a respectable home. You can't enter here at night! I'm not your servant or Miss Jeannette's. Shut up! You darn doorman. - I told you I'll get you a tip later. - By whom? - "By whom"? From Professor Castracane! - Castracane? Now, when I catch him with that wretched woman. - Come with me. - Castracane? - Where? You'll know it later. - Come here! What are you doing? - Shut up, you damn doorman! But look at that! What do I know? She went in there and found someone waiting for her. - Who? - A man called her. If you feel like a cuckold, blame him, not me. - I'll kill him. - Good, so there will be more space. - Open up or I'm breaking in! - Miss Jeannette is busy! We'll make her unbusy! My wife must know everything. Open up! - It's him and my wife is here too. - Him who? That sucker we were supposed to frame. Already here? Why didn't you tell me before? I didn't know. Are there no other holes here? - No, just that. - That's too small. I have to hide. - Hey, what are you doing? - Not here? - My God! - Where? I'll break it down, holy hell! Will you stop? Where is that cheater? Check it out, sir. I've nothing to hide. No, you're hiding him. You're lying through your teeth. Here a man is hiding. A cheater, an adult! But my darling, what are you saying to your sweetie? Have you lost your mind? After what happened between us. It isn't true. Prassede, don't listen to her, she's stalling! She's lying through her teeth. My good...! Here is the evidence of the crime. As you all can see, this is a hat. Under a hat there must be a man. - What do you think this is, Galleria Colonna? - Worse than that! If you don't tell me where those two are, I'll strangle you! Hey, what are you doing? Are you crazy? Shut up! Come on, talk. They asked about Miss Jeannette of the Mimosa Pension. See? I was right to spy on her. I'll commit a massacre now. I'll fix them! What does he want to do? There will be a massacre! Call the police right away. - Yes. - Stop him! Here he is! Scoundrel, get out of there! - Get out, I caught you! - Ah, I caught you! - No, I did. - No, I did. - And what is this? - A hat. - And whose is it? - It's mine. And why was it here? For the betrayal. Adulterer! I was here to catch you. I have witnesses. - They're my witnesses. - He was cheating on my wife. They're eyewitnesses. He's the cheater, I have witnesses. It's me, I'm the eyewitness. Well, I caught you! - Nino, what are you doing here? - Me? What are you doing here? - You wretch! You're having an orgy with that lady's husbands! - What? But I'll kill them. I'll strangle them! Run, the pension is on the first floor! Hurry up, he's going to kill everybody! He said he'd make a massacre! Who sent us this madman tonight? I didn't expect this from you two. I didn't deserve it. I'm hospitalized in a clinic for nervous breakdown, because I have to decide which of you two deserves me, and you have fun in objectionable pensions! - No! Not me. - With hussies! If that's me, watch your language. I'm an artist. Shut up, you faker! She's the lover of the phonograph ... of the photographer... - of the adult... of the adulterer! - What? He can't even talk! I got my tongue stuck in Russia. Arrest her! Arrest her, that's an order! I am a veteran! - It's not true, darling. - Get your hands off me! He's her lover, I swear. - The counselor knows. - Me? I know nothing. Counselor, sometimes you must admit... Not at all! I know nothing. If you're a man of honor, remember to keep me out of this thing. - Filth, counselor! Say it. - You're right, ma'am. Filth! Counselor, I'm a man of honor, but you're a vermin. Approved! He's a vermin. Put this on record! - Silence! - Silence. From now on I am her lawyer. Give me a break! Lawyer... You're a vermin! Your accomplice said so too! Lietta, don't trust him. Shall I explain it to you? Don't listen to these filthy things. Ma'am, please come with me. - Yes, take me away. How disgusting! - Come on, ma'am. - Amalia, where are you going? Wait! - Stop! Get off me! I demand to speak to the inspector. But I didn't know that. What's going on there? - What a mess. - Will you please be quiet? You have to excuse me, but if I do these things it's because I love you. Imagine if you didn't love me. - But who are you? - The inspector. - You finally come! - Don't shout! - Yes, sir. - I'm not your servant. - Neither are we. You're right but we're in a hurry. Our wife is in danger. That's what I want to clarify. Get in. You know what? In five minutes my husbands became two strangers to me. You're right. Their behavior was really despicable. But you were lucky. Amalia, you're young. Life can still smile at you. You're right. I don't have to think about it. Besides, if they had fun, why shouldn't I? Sure! Let's have fun. You can't sleep at your home tonight. You'd be at the starting point. You know, you're right. - I can't go to sleep... - You can't. Do you live far away? In Parioli. Shall we go? But what are you thinking, counselor? Ehm... that you... I just asked you to drive me to a hotel. OK, but only for tonight. - What do you mean? - Amalia, I had a wonderful idea. Some friends of mine own a yacht and are going on a long cruise. There's no better occasion if you want to forget. A cruise? I've always dreamed of going on a cruise. Cannes, Saint Tropez, Costa Brava, Canaries... It's gonna be great. Inspector, it's a very complex matter. In 1940, when it started... - No, I must start from the beginning. - Professor! You're making it too long! This is a complex matter. What can this poor fellow understand? Why, do you think I'm an idiot? - I don't know. - Lo Cosimo. Sir, it's not about intelligence. You too can figure it out with some patience. - If there's an idiot here... - It's me? - No. But you openly called me an idiot! I wouldn't even dare to think that. - He did. - Me? I said that the inspector is an idiot? He's crazy! He wanted to say it but I stopped him by hitting his foot. - God forbid. I know him. - That's not true, inspector. - Stop it! - What manners! - You're insulting a public official! - Of course. - They go to jail for that! - Right! - Bring them in. - Me too? - Me too? - Should I go in? - If you like. - Bring them in. - One moment. Take them away! This is mine. And this too. 10 days after Professor, when do we get to Canaries? - We're on the route. - Then it's dangerous. - Why? - We're on the street. On the air route! Professor, I still have food in my stomach. Don't tell me these things. It's the first time I fly. A mere hint's enough for me to flood the place. - Excuse me, professor. - Are you crazy? - And where can I do it? - There's the bag. - Where is it? - Behind the seat. - Ma'am. - Yes? - Your bag. - What are you doing? - I'm throwing up, I'm sorry. - No, give it back to me, please! - He's crazy! - But where... Behind the front seat. No, don't bother. - What did he say? - That you're annoying him. All those words to say that? - Do you understand Chinese? - No. - So what! - What did you say? - I said sorry in Chinese. Professor, give me some baking soda. Mamma mia! Why are you asking me? Ask the employee, the hostess. - Bellboy! Driver! - Hostess! [the same] - Sir, may I help you? - She's the hostess. I don't know if she's the same. - It's the employee. - Yes? - The hostess. - I don't know if she's the same! Miss, this submarine goes slow. It's a train, not a plane, listen to me. It's an omnibus. - We're in a hurry. - Calm down, sir. we saw a bank of clouds and had to change course. - Ah, we're in the banks. - And what are we doing in the banks? With so much space in the sky do we go to in the banks? What are we, account holders? But sir, this is a serious company. Serious, my foot! Change jobs if you don't know how to drive! For heaven's sake, do you want to do another 10 days in prison for insulting a public official? - That's a woman! - But she's an officer on duty. Well, we must hurry, dear professor. We have to go fast. Can you drive this thing? - I'm not a pilot. - Just to speed up, understand? Every moment that passes, that lawyer friend of yours... - What's his name? - Vacchi. [cows] That bitch of a lawyer, with our wife... If we're not careful, we'll wear a nice pair of horns. Again? Oh, yeah. Professor, the canaries! Guys, the canaries have passed! - And didn't we stop? - What do I know? That way. They were flying that way. - You mean birds? - Yes, every canary was like that. Attention, fasten your seat belts. - Fasten your belt. - I wear suspenders. No, the seat belt. It's a safety equipment. - This? - Yes. It's really convenient. One just needs to fasten his safety belt and he's safe... - What is it? - The lights went out. Light! Who has a candle? Professor, we're stuck. There is no power. No power? There's a breakdown. Attention, attention. Don't panic. Easier said than done. We're in distress. - Where are we? - In distress. - Good, we've arrived in Distress. - Good, my foot! Don't panic. We're going down. - Ah, very good! - Very good, what? We're going down. And who cares? We've arrived in Distress. - We're going down. - Hello? Who's speak... I hear nothing, there's propellers noise. A PLANE DISAPPEARED flying over the Atlantic The search for the missing plane continues US command ended the search of the missing plane Upsy daisy! Long live the newlyweds! - Come. - Long live the newlyweds! My love. Help yourselves. Come on, have a drink. Look, darling, it's been seven years now. Why don't we take down those portraits? Yes, you're right. Thank you, darling. No shadow must darken our happiness. - Ah, our home. - For seven years on that desert island. I've waited for this moment. But we've got an advantage. Amalia, in this seven years, has had time to choose me or you. Press the bell. - Did you press it? - Yes.
