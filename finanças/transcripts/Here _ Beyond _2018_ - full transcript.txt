Okay, as far as we can tell, all signs point to a very serious condition in your brain. You're just in the very early stages right now, but this condition progresses at a very rapid rate, and it's just a matter of time before your memories will start to deteriorate and you'll completely lose your grasp on reality. Mac? Mac, are you listening? This is important. Would you like me to talk to your wife? She's dead. Okay, in that case, you're going to have to start what we call the purge process. The what? Photos, home videos, clothing, furniture, anything that brings your wife to mind will need to go, they'll just add to the confusion as what's going to happen begins to happen. It's much better if you just forget about her. There's no way of telling which memories will go and in what order, but it will likely be the most recent first, and progress backwards from there, as if, in your mind, you're actually going back in time. What's with the Christmas stuff? You know it's July, right? Yes, I know it's July. Where are you taking that chair? Why do you want to know? You're right, I guess I don't actually care. Then what? - You good? - Yeah. Look at all this junk. How long have you been living here? Hey. Hey, what are you doing? - What is this? - It's nothing. I said, nothing! Whatever, dude. Say, Ruth, what time is it? Time for you to get a watch, Mac. Yeah? Well, watch this. I put on this helmet, I buckle the strap, then I lift the visor just like that. It happens in that order. Time always runs the same way. It never runs backwards. Mac. Ruth? Mac, where are you? Mac, I'm on the moon. How did you get all the way over there? That's at least-- 239,000 miles away, and it's the closest object to Earth. You should be lucky I'm not on Pluto. That's 4.67 billion miles away. Now that's far. When are you coming back? There's so much more to discover. Why don't you come with me? With you? How? I'm not doing summer school! You need to catch up with the other kids your age! It's not my fault I can't finish out a year! You know why we have to keep moving! You never listen to me! Mac, thank you for coming back in. We've got the test results back, and it seems you've advanced to the final stage of the condition. I want to remind you that at any time now, the much more serious deterioration could start happening. Do you have anyone in your life to care for you? Companionship is very important at a time like this. You know you've got Saturn on your ceiling. Time always runs the same way. It never runs backwards. It keeps going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going. And going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going... What about what I want? And don't use that tone with me! - No one ever asked me! - Back in the house! You know how hard it is to make new friends every six months? I barely get my bag contacts before we up and move to some other cookie-cutter suburbs that look just like the last ones! Tess, you are grounded, young lady! I hate you! So I guess these are all pretty much dead. I got you this. Happy 4th. So, are you going to go to the fireworks show tonight down at the park? My mom told me I should go try and make some friends, but I don't like most people, including you, sort of right now, but I forgive you. What? It's a time machine. The thing in the garage. Ruth's time machine. I told her she was crazy, I told her that. But I think she had fun just dreaming about it. Everyone was convinced that the sun-- Does it work? No. So is she dead, or what? Yeah. Christmas Eve. Hence all the Christmas stuff. Time always runs the same way. It never runs backwards. Never say never, Mac. All it took was one scientist looking at it differently, and voila, now the sun doesn't rise; it's the Earth turns. Maybe one of you out there is looking at things differently right now, and that can change everything. We had an argument, I stormed out, she died. Just like that. I don't even remember what we were arguing about. So, you're just going to forget everything? Yeah, I guess. Even this? Probably. I just wanted to say goodbye. And I'll never get to. I don't know, never say never. Hi, Mac. Is it starting? Yes, it's starting now. I'm scared. Just because you don't remember doesn't mean it can't happen. What do I do? Come here. Closer. Hey, wake up, I had a great idea. - What are you doing? - Right over here, come on. Get in. What are you doing? Trust me. So each one of these is a memory, right? Just get down. Tell me which ones you want to keep, and which ones you don't. Tennis racket. What about your alarm clock? Do you want the globe? Last one. No. No? You can own him. It's yours now. Thanks. Merry Christmas. Mac?
