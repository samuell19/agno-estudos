FIVE SCOUTS Face the national flag! Present...arms! At... ease! Soldiers, thanks to your valiant efforts we were able to take this position. Despite this being the front-line, we managed to push back the enemy. The enemy could counter-attack at any time. But we will hold this position to the last man until reinforcements arrive. From 200 men, we're now down to 80. But we must faithfully fulfil our duty to the last man. I want you all to keep that in mind while we're here. That's all! At ease! Sergeant Fujimoto. A courier. -Yes, sir! Private Kimura! -Yes, sir! Order! Private Kimura, as courier, you are to report this to headquarters: The Okada company advanced along the river and captured Liqxi today at 3:50. The 500 man strong enemy force has fallen back to the south. but we don't know if it has stayed at that position, or moved toward Xiaoshan. The inhabitants of the village have all fled. In this battle, our company has lost a large number of men. We have two seriously and seven lightly wounded men. That is all! Repeating order! Private Kimura, as courier, will report this to headquarters: The Okada company advanced along the river and captured Liqxi today at 3:50. The 500 man strong enemy force has fallen back to the south, but we don't know if it has stayed... Here are your orders for now. This position will be held by the second squad of the Okada company. The enemy has been spotted falling back towards the plain you see in front of us. This squad must very attentively watch what happens on the mountain range to the right. On the right flank is the Ishiwara company. On the left, the Yamane company. At all times, you will be in touch with both of them by use of couriers. That is all! -Repeating order! This position will be held by the second squad of the Okada company. The enemy has been spotted falling back... Cease! Change! Those resting are allowed to smoke! Water... Can I have some water? -Alright! This will hurt a little. Hey, the water is surprisingly good! We can make some tasty food with this. Commander Okada, sir! Airplane on the horizon! You're doing a great job! We're counting on you! -Ready the banner! Go! Spread out! What do you think? -Where did you find these? They ran into me and from now on, they're my prisoners. We'll have a feast tonight. Hey, we'll have a feast! -We're counting on you! This is good. It smells like sukiyaki. -Sukiyaki?! I see... It does. It really does. I can smell the matsutake mushrooms. I can smell the grill. There are eggs too. What are you doing? I'm eating with my hand. You got it. Some red bean soup would also be nice. Red bean soup? Oh... I see... I want some so bad... Fool! You finally confessed. That's looking good. -Hey, look at Nagano! Hey, come eat some watermelon. Sure. Thanks a lot. Make way! Let him do it! It seems dull but it works for watermelon splitting. I know you have a fever, but it's better not to drink much. Hey! Here, eat some watermelon! Can I? -Yeah. Inoue, do you want some? Do you like it? Hey Nagano! There's a bullet hole in this one! Oh, you're right! Ah... So while picking these I heard a shot in the distance. Were they aiming for me? What is it? -What is it? Commander, sir! A courier has arrived! Urgent report! Reporting! The first scout squad has seen two enemy soldiers. One was killed. The other is on the run. We're currently in pursuit. That's all, sir! Alright! Looks like they got him. It was inevitable. Facing left... Halt! Remove bayonets! That's all! Sir, we've patrolled the area. Nothing to report. -Alright. Shall I send Nagano to scout the mountain range on the left flank? -Do that. Around 5 pm, as we advanced about 70 meters into enemy terrain, a heavy rain started coming down. As we resumed advancing toward the enemy lines... ...a little after 11 pm, we found the enemy's camp and engaged them in battle. The rain continued all night. Because of the situation, we were unable to communicate with headquarters. The battle went on until late into the night. During this battle... During this battle... ...Lieutenant Ono took a bullet to the chest and died honorably in action. And died honorably in action... The only remaining officer... ...was Lieutenant Okada. Commander, sir, you should get some rest. I've not seen you sleep these last few days. Thank you. You know, I feel uneasy unless I fill in the company log. Only this log tells the hardships our soldiers go through. I feel it would be fine for me to die at any time after filling in the log. I'm not going to let you die, sir. I still have three cigarettes left. Have one. -Thank you, sir. Whenever I have some spare time, I like to go through this log. You should try reading it too... -Yes, sir. No matter how difficult the circumstances, your courage comes surging back. The spirits of our dead seem to gather together in your body. However... ...it's very hard for me to write down the names of those who died in this battle. Your meal, sir. Thank you. Are the men eating? -Yes, sir. So I managed to get to where he'd fallen and said to him: "Get hold of yourself!", then he started saying something. Kiguchi, what do you think he said? -What did he say? "I can see Japan! I can see Japan!", that's what he said. The he started singing the national anthem, but only got the first few words out before dying. I see... I was right next to Yamaguchi when he started to write a letter. "Dear Mother"... That was all he managed to write when a stray bullet came out of nowhere. Then he fell over... ...and that was it. That's too bad. Reconnaissance squad, line up! Attention! Left...face! Shoulder...arms! March! On the double! Did you eat? How was it? -Yeah, it was delicious. Glad to hear it. Inoue. Are you in any pain? It's nothing. Don't worry about it. Kimura has returned safely from headquarters! Good job! -Great job! Did you report in? -Yeah. Did you bring anything back? -Yeah, I did. Hey, everyone come over here. What is it? -What is it? I got these while I was at headquarters. Here. There's more! -What else? These! Let's start with some Golden Bat. No, let's start with Homare since Golden Bat are better. Yeah, that's right. Let's start with Homare. -No, Golden Bat. Homare it is. -Don't be absurd! What if we see some action tonight? What's the point of keeping the Golden Bat if you're dead? You're right... -Golden Bat. Alright! -What's wrong? This is so good! How in the world is that just a "scratch"? Really, it's nothing serious. I'm fine. The day before yesterday, gazing at those walls from the other side, thinking of breaking through... I think it was good that it started to rain. But now, look at tonight's wonderful moon... That's exactly what I was thinking. Will this do? -Thank you, sir. Sergeant, the ambulance is here! Hey, Inoue... You did well enduring it for so long. They may also have wounded from other units. Yeah, wanna' take a look? We have nine wounded, two of them severely. -We'll take care of them. More, go more. That's enough! You men fought well. Are you in pain? -We're fine, sir. Endure it. What's wrong? Where'd they get you? -In the leg. They got me in the shoulder and some shrapnel in my eye. Is that so? You need anything? -Yes, any water? I'd like a cigarette. Do you have any? -Sure. Do you have one? -Yeah, I do. Hey, here's the water! -Thank you. Is it good? -It's delicious. No, I don't want to. I'm fine! There's no need to take me over this slight injury! I'm fine. It's just a scratch. I don't need to go. Please let me stay. Please! The bullet is still in you, you know. What if they have to amputate your arm because you don't have it treated? I don't mind! I don't mind losing my arm! I can still carry out my duties just fine! Masaki, don't be ridiculous. Come on now. Let's go. No, sergeant. I don't want to leave no matter what happens to me! Hey... Look at Inoue. He's resigned himself to this without complaint. Masaki, just go. You can't even hold a rifle. Give this up. But I can! See, I can! Masaki! Yes, sir. Order! Private Masaki is to leave at once and get treated. Yes, sir. I'll go. The commander and I understand how you feel. But, an injury is an injury. Go get treated then hurry back! You go that? Yes, sir! I have the latest rescript, would you like to see it? Thank you very much. Inoue, hold on a little longer. Hurry back, okay? Get well and hurry back! Masaki, we'll back for you. -See you. I'll be back. Masaki, take care. Hey, get well and hurry back. Get well. We'll wait for you. Sergeant Fujimoto! -Yes, sir! Assemble the men! -Yes, sir! Attention everyone! Assemble! Attention everyone! Assemble! Attention! Everyone has assembled, sir! At ease. Straighten your caps. Attention! Graciously, His Majesty, our Great Emperor, on the occasion of this China Incident, has issued a new Imperial Rescript. I now humbly invite you to hear it, and learn, as Imperial subjects, what it's truly like to be awe-struck. I shall now read it. Rest. Attention! Imperial Rescript: "According to the agreements of cooperation between the Empire and the Republic of China," "securing East Asia's stability, in view of achieving mutual prosperity," "is what preoccupies Our mind day and night." "But the Republic of China deeply fails to understand the Empire's real intention." "taking an unnecessary stand that led to the recent incidents, which We find regrettable." "We now urge Our military personnel to repel all obstacles with their loyalty and bravery," "solely to stimulate the Republic of China's reconsideration" "and establishing East Asia's pea..." Attention! Left...face! Shoulder...arms! March! On the double! These are brand new. You deserve them, sir! Thank you. Headquarters messenger! HQ order! HQ is preparing for a general offensive. The Okada company is to investigate and report the enemy's position! That's all, sir! Acknowledged! -I'm returning, sir! Good work. Order! Sergeant Fujimoto shall lead a scouting party of four men to scout the enemy force that was heading towards Xiaoshan and return within three hours. That's all. Repeating order! Sergeant Fujimoto will lead a scouting party of four men to scout the enemy force that was heading toward Xiaoshan and return within three hours. That's all! Alright. Load weapons! Fix bayonets! Ready, sir! Forward! Be careful! -We're counting on you! Halt! Do you hear anything? I don't. -Alright. Forward! Halt! Hide! Hold you fire! We're already in enemy territory. -Alright, let's cross over. Forward! Get down! A bunker? We can't see their camp from here. It's a little steep but we'll cross here! Halt! Forward! Here is the vanguard, and in this spot is the sentry. Here are the trenches. -I see. Got it? -Yeah. In this spot is a bunker. Got that? We've been spotted, sir! -Got it! Damn it! They've surrounded us! Alright! Return fire! Are you okay? Yes, sir. Just a scratch. Enemy on the left! -Got 'em! Can you move? -Yes, sir! Keep going! Let's go! Nakamura! Fall back! Fall back! Alright! Kiguchi, I'm ready. Come on! Nakamura, go! Kiguchi, come on! Will the sergeant be all right? -He's not someone that gets shot that easily. Do you have the correct time? Let me check, sir. It's already two hours past the designated time. Second squad! Has anyone returned? -No one has passed through here! Check with the other squads. On my way! -Alright. Oh!... Sergeant! You okay? Did anyone else return? -No, sergeant. No one. No one... Someone's coming back! It's Sergeant Fujimoto! It's Sergeant Fujimoto! Sergeant! Fujimoto scouts, reporting! The enemy lies south, about 3,000 meters from here. It's first line is on the southern bank of the river. 500 meters behind that... After 125 meters of marshes is the second line. There are trenches and bunkers. Their main force is concentrated in Xiaoshan. You'll find the details on the map. That's all, sir! Good work. What about the others? Sir... While scouting the enemy, we were surrounded on three sides... We got separated as we tried to retreat. Alright. Let's write the report right away. -Yes, sir! You must be tired, sergeant. I'm sure it was exhausting. We were really worried. -Ah, Nagano is back! Sergeant, Nagano is back! Nagano! Sergeant! Fujimoto scouts, Private Nagano, reporting! Close to the enemy lines... I ran into Toyama and Nakamura, but because I couldn't see the scout leader and scout Kiguchi I decided to make the report myself. The two of them went searching for the scout leader and scout Kiguchi. That's all, sir! Alright, go and get some rest. -Yes, sir! Good work! You had us worried. Because the enemy lines were very well camouflaged, they were impossible to see until we were almost on top of them. For that reason, we went in further than we should have... I'm extremely sorry for this outcome, sir. It was all for the sake of the mission. Everything will be fine as long as Kiguchi makes it back. -Yes, sir. Come now, let's write the report. I'm amazed you made it back. -I was just lucky. I'm still glad... -Yeah. Here you go. Kiguchi... Stay alive! Sergeant Fujimoto, ready a courier. -Sir? Yes, sir! Private Saki. -Yes, sir? Get ready as a courier! -Yes, sir! Scouts have returned! Hey, scouts have returned! We went back up to the point where we lost track of Kiguchi. The enemy soldiers has already retreated... but we still couldn't find Kiguchi. Then we finally found Kiguchi's helmet lying in a shell hole. This is...his helmet, sir! I see... "The scouting mission was successful. Private Kiguchi is missing and presumed killed in action." Combat Log Okada Company Kiguchi must be getting wet now. Kiichi... If you're alive, come back. If you're dead... That's fine too. I just want to know which one it is. However...If he's lying somewhere wounded... I just can't stand it. Third scout squad has seen an enemy patrol heading south! That's all, sir! Alright! Where are you going? I just can't stand still. I'll go ask the commander to let me look for Kiguchi. I'll come too. I can very well understand your desire to help a comrade. But this is a battlefield. I will not allow the loss of more soldiers for the sake of a single one. Just like you... Sergeant Fujimoto also suffers for the loss of one of his men. The sergeant's... and my feelings... We mustn't act according to them. We must come to terms with the fact that Private Kiguchi met a honorable death. That's exactly what I reported to headquarters. You should think the same way, and accept it. Nakamura, do you understand? Yes, sir. I understand. Alright. We will soon go back into battle. You must take good care of yourselves. Go back and get some rest. At your orders! Salute! Sergeant. -Yes, sir! You should try reading the log in moments when you feel like you do. Yes, sir. Read it out loud. Out loud. I am reading it. "Eleventh day. Starting today, Lt. Okada assumes command." "Commander Izaka was killed during yesterday's fighting." "Yesterday evening, after a short break, the enemy launched a powerful assault." "We accepted battle and after two hours, pushed the enemy back." "Notwithstanding his numerous wounds, Commander Izaka led the men to the very end." "Unrelentingly." "Only towards the end, when he was sure victory was ours..." "he yelled 'Banzai!' three times, fell down and died." "He was removed from the field and everyone wanted to honor him one last time." "What an excellent death with no regrets." "I remember our vow made last summer" "when I refused to take command of these 200 men." "But among these brave officers and men" "there was a brave private that had taken the place of a fallen squad leader and was himself shot right away." "There was one who rushed alone into the midst of the enemy, opening our path to victory." "One, mortally wounded, on the brink of death cared more for his CO, calling: 'Commander, sir! Sir!." "When someone rushed to help a wounded comrade, he said: 'Leave me! Go on! Go on!'." "One hid his serious wounds and kept fighting at the very front of our line." "Another, under artillery fire, saved his superior's life." Commander, sir! HQ order for Okada company! Our commander is right here! Orders for the Okada company from HQ. The enemy has been reinforced across the entire front. An attack seems imminent. We'll strike first though. Tomorrow at 5 am, we'll launch a general assault. Okada company will cooperate with the Ishiwara and Yamane companies, using the triangle strategy and will advance 125 meters toward the enemy camp in Xiaoshan. That's all, sir! Alright! Report back that the Okada company will be ready. -Yes, sir! I will report that the Okada company will be ready. Good job. You must be tired. Take some rest. -Sir... I still have duties to fulfill, sir. I must go back at once! I see. I'm going back now, sir! Who goes there? Who goes there? Fujimoto scouts... Ki...Private Kiguchi! He's back! Kiguchi is back! Kiguchi is back! It's really him. -It's Kiguchi. Kiguchi! -Hey, get a grip on yourselves! Calm down, man! -Hey... Kiguchi... I'm glad you made it back! -Sergeant... Kiguchi! I'm really glad you're back! We were waiting for you! Everyone... Everyone... Kiguchi, go report to the commander! Give me my rifle... Give me my rifle! I apologize for coming back so late, sir! Yesterday... surrounded by the enemy, we got separated from the scout leader and, as I was retreating together with Private Nakamura.... Before I knew it, I lost track of him. So I went looking for him. They say not to go looking for a comrade... But... I wanted... to at least... find his body. Thank you. Suddenly, I was again surrounded by the enemy. I remember killing two or three of them with my bayonet... What happened after... I can't remember. I remember that it started to rain. When I came to my senses... I was lying down in the mud. As I started walking, I found the Big Dipper... North... So I headed north, in order to return here. Commander, sir! -Yes? I'm sorry for returning without fulfilling the scouting mission. No, you've fulfilled your duty well enough. You did well to return. I'm very glad you did. Yes, sir! I fired twenty round with my rifle. And I lost my helmet. That's all, sir! Nakamura brought back your helmet, you know. Alright, go rest now. Good work. Take this off. It's soaking wet. Someone, bring an overcoat. -Got it. Kiguchi, I'm glad you're back. Thank you. Thank you... You must be starving, right? Have this while we get you a meal. Thank you. Here. I've just warmed it up. Thank you. Here's some broth! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you... Thank you... Thank you... Kiguchi. I'm so happy. May Your Reign... ...continue for thousands of years. Until the pebbles... ...grow into boulders... ...lush with moss. Third platoon, attention! -Attention! Salute our commander! -Salute! Left...face! Face...forward! First platoon, all 21 present. Awaiting your orders! Second platoon, all 19 present. Awaiting your orders! Third platoon, all 19 present.

Private Sagai, as courier, you are to report this to headquarters: One: At 5 am, the Okada company will directly launch a full offensive. Two: Private Kiguchi, thought dead, has come back and will take part in the offensive. That's all! Repeating order! Private Sagai, as courier, will report to headquarters: Private Sagai, as a courier, will report to the main force: One: At 5 am, the Okada company will directly launch a full offensive. Two: Private Kiguchi, thought dead, has come back and will take part in the offensive. That is all! Alright. I'm leaving, sir! Attention! The company shall now march forward. I have nothing more to say that you don't already know. I'm sure that you're all prepared. This is the exact time to repay His Majesty's great benevolence with our lives. If I go away to the sea, I shall be a corpse washed up. For our company's honor... For the Imperial Army's honor. I expect each and every one of you to do your duty properly. The Orient's peace... Asia's peace, is depending on you. Our parents back home... Our brothers and sisters... Our wives and children... They eagerly look upon how well we will do our duty. Thinking of them... I wouldn't want to lose any of you. But, from this moment on, I want you to entrust your lives to me. And... I want you to die together with me. Long live His Majesty the Emperor! We shall now perform a salute towards our country. Present...arms! Salute! Order...arms! Okada company, ready! First platoon... Second platoon... Third platoon... Fourth platoon...
