TETE DURING THE ARMED STRUGGLE NYAZÔNIA AUGUST 1976 WHY ARE THEY ATTACKING US? In a few words I would say that they are attacking us because they are enemies of freedom. Imperialism, imperialism... I mean the racist, the colonialist, all these are always enemies of freedom. I'd say they're attacking us because they don't want to see Mozambican people independent. They don't want to see an independent Mozambican people. Produced by National Film Institute of Maputo May 1978 THESE ARE THE WEAPONS Mozambique was dominated by Portuguese colonialism for 500 years. For 500 years, especially after the so-called "war of occupation", we learned that the true face of colonialism is aggression. The colonial armies are armies of aggression. Colonialism itself is permanent aggression. A form of aggression that aims to maintain dominance for the sake of exploitation. The compulsory cultivation of cotton was one of the many violent ways our people were exploited. We were dying of hunger while making cotton and we were forced to sell cotton for the price of hunger. Our sweat served to enrich those exploiting us. Colonialism divided us to better dominate us. But the colonialists understood each other. They arranged ways to steal from us more effectively and held meetings to figure out how best to oppress and dominate us. Let's see some of the images of these meetings. Let's see who was one of Portuguese colonialism's major allies. THE GOVERNOR GENERAL OF THE FEDERATION'S VISIT All the top dignitaries of Lourenço Marques rushed to the airport, to welcome the Governor General of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland at the beginning of his official visit to Mozambique. Next to the runway platform, a guard of honor paid appropriate homage to His Majesty's representative. During his stay in Lourenço Marques, His Excellency made a visit to the port, where large volumes of cargo are handled for the Federation. The major railway company operating centers merited his special attention because that is where the delicate and flawless work is carried out to ensure the proper functioning of vital lines of communication, which largely depend on the economic life of the Federation. One of the highlights of the visit was the banquet for the guests of honor hosted by the Governor General and Mrs. Correia de Barros. Commander Mr. Correia de Barros took to the floor referring to the Portuguese mission in Africa and how well relations have always been maintained ending with a toast in honor of the distinguished visitors. Lord Darhouse responded by uttering words of great sympathy for Portugal and referred enthusiastically to the friendly and continually expanding exchange between the Federation and Mozambique. The personal contact between the two men would surely bring benefits to the friendly countries they represented. At the meeting we just saw there was no talk of exploitation or oppression. But that's what they were dealing in. That is what was worrying the representatives of Portuguese colonialism and of British colonialism. Colonialism is an instrument of imperialism. Imperialism feeds on the blood of the people. Let's now see some more images showing the colonial governors recruiting their agents in our midst. We will see that colonialism not only used violence to oppress us, but also psychosocial means. The corrupt feudal chiefs were internal allies of colonialism. Mozambique is surely... They even called themselves Portuguese! ...a national expression. A Portuguese word that means Portugal. In it there is all the nobility that turn all words beautiful. A kind of candor with a welcome taste. Mozambique...! Such a beautiful word whenever it is said, whoever will say it. Mozambique...! It's cheerful as the cheetah, it has the grace and the timbre of a woman's smile. ...but we never surrendered. Our people have always resisted occupation and colonial domination. Our resistance to colonialism is a story of many revolts. But we were always losers because we were divided by tribalism, regionalism, racism. Down with the colonialists! Down with the colonialists! The struggle continues! The struggle continues! Independence or death, Mozambique! Independence or death, Mozambique! Here, in the Cabo Delgado province, when the war started, we only had 25 soldiers. Did you hear that? These are the weapons that began the war here in Cabo Delgado. FRELIMO will be victorious in the struggle for freedom. FRELIMO will triumph... FRELIMO rallied our people around our ideal fatherland. It was FRELIMO that taught us that our secret is unity, that our main strength is the people. Mozambican men and women, workers and peasants, workers from plantations and sawmills, mine workers, railway workers, port and factory workers, intellectuals, officers, students, Mozambican soldiers in the Portuguese army, men, women and adolescents, patriots: on your behalf, FRELIMO today proclaims the general armed insurrection of the Mozambican people against Portuguese colonialism to achieve the full and complete independence of Mozambique. We will not stop fighting until the complete and total removal of Portuguese colonialism has been attained. Since FRELIMO was established, colonialism feels very threatened. It has been preparing its forces for combat and strengthening its alliances. Who is the first to come to the rescue of Portuguese colonialism? Who is this talking to Salazar? It's Smith, of course. They have many common interests. So they are allies. The Portuguese were able to dominate us for a long time because we were unable to achieve unity. We had no understanding of how important our unity was. Long live FRELIMO! Long live the liberation movement of FRELIMO! Long live the liberation movement of FRELIMO! Long live the Mozambican people! Long live the Mozambican people! Independence or death! Independence or death! The struggle continues! The struggle continues! The struggle continues! Down with the enemy! Sometimes you need to trample... Down with Portuguese colonialism! FRELIMO did not only recruit fighters, it transformed lives. It set loose initiative and made people aware of their strength. Armed struggle was the highest form of resistance to colonial aggression. Armed struggle was the affirmation of our culture and our national identity. Within the ranks of the aggressor's army those who distinguished themselves are those who massacred defenseless people and destroyed the population's property. They are the heroes of colonialism. The bombings carried out by the enemy are to destroy the conditions created by these weapons. The people knew how to transform pain into new strength as soon as they were certain of victory. The people could draw on the depths of suffering, draw on courage for continued resistance, and engage in further tasks linked to the armed struggle. The enemy could try to destroy or burn down this indestructible certainty, but they could not conquer it. Out of the ashes, life will return anew. Life in the liberated zones forged new production conditions and led us to understand the underlying reason for our struggle. We denounced and neutralized the new explorers who appeared in our midst. That wasn't what we were fighting for. After all the sacrifices we had made and all the bloodshed, we were not about to let Black exploiters take the place of White ones. Our struggle was to expel colonialism and all forms of exploitation and domination. The target is in this direction. Attention! Fire! Fire! To fully understand how developed our war actually is and our presence here... This really means our war is highly developed. It is a decisive battle, both for the enemy and for us. That's because of the direct intervention of so many foreigners, such as those from South Africa and Southern Rhodesia who are entering our country. It's therefore crucial both for FRELIMO and the enemy. After the events on the Tete front, we experienced a large-scale incursion by the Rhodesian forces... operating to the north of the Zambezi River. They were operating throughout that part of the Zambezi River together with Portuguese forces. And at one time they were operating on their own. Portuguese colonialism could not stop the advance of the armed struggle. So they decided to take advantage of a natural barrier, the Zambezi River. They considered the North Zone to be contaminated by FRELIMO and the South, it was the area for the settlers. This area had to be defended at all costs. POPULATION MUST NOT CROSS THE RIVER. POPULATION MUST NOT WALK WITH THE OUTLAW. DO NOT CROSS THE RIVER. RUN AWAY FROM THE OUTLAWS. OTHERWISE YOU WILL DIE. For the Cahora Bassa project, imperialism came out in force to help Portuguese colonialism. The Cahora Bassa would be an insurmountable barrier to prevent the crossing of the Zambezi River. Moreover, the population would be expelled from the area and the valley would be occupied by a million white settlers to be recruited in several countries. As the Portuguese army was not powerful enough to defend the area and safeguard the construction work, the armies of South Africa and Rhodesia began to operate openly in the areas allocated to them. In December 1970, FRELIMO crossed the Zambezi. These guys in shorts are Rhodesians. This was one of many joint operations they carried out with the Portuguese colonial army. The purpose of these operations was to cut off FRELIMO's supply routes and prevent the struggle from making progress. Their tactics were to carry out massacres to intimidate the population. They were experts at murdering unarmed people. In Tete province, they used so-called Minerva tactics during this period. These tactics were carried out by Rhodesian forces, whose goal it was to destroy property and continue to terrorize the population, killing children, old men and women... Some say there is a colonial war. What colonial war? It is easy to see that none of this is occurring in the Portuguese overseas territories. The overseas provinces are at peace. At the first little jolt from savage... ...savage murderers and rapists! Should we raise our arms in surrender? Marcello Caetano is saying there is no such thing as a colonial war. He wants Portuguese soldiers to come in secret to kill in Mozambique and die in secret too. But Caetano didn't know that you can't stop the wind with your hands. People that take up guns to free themselves cannot be defeated. Our experience tells us that social justice, freedom, and peace can't be achieved just by following through on good intentions. Just yesterday, colonialism was pointing its weapons of oppression towards our legitimate desire for freedom. Today is June 21st. It's the Day of Victory for the entire Mozambican people, united from Rovuma to Maputo. This victory was achieved at the cost of innumerable sacrifices. It's against our victory, against our freedom and independence, that assaults are being committed. THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES The threat hasn't disappeared today. The ones that exploited us before have not renounced the proceeding stages of exploitation. Capitalists don't willingly accept the end of their privileges. Our fight has to be organized in the same way as it was during the armed struggle. Oppressed people must organize themselves. The aim of our struggle, the struggle of the working classes, is to build our country as a society without either exploiters or the exploited. To achieve our objectives, we must engage in a fight on several fronts, a fight for life or death against class enemies who are ready for anything. It is necessary more than ever to reinforce the social classes engaged in the continuation of the revolutionary process so they can lead the process and be capable of neutralizing the class enemy's manipulations. This will lead to the triumph of the Revolution. The party was founded based on an understanding on the part of the FRELIMO militants and those most conscious within the working classes that without a revolutionary party who can lead the working masses and peasant masses and all the other workers through social class struggle, through economic, political and ideological battles, socialism will not be possible to be built. It is from this perspective... It is from this perspective that the Central Committee proposes, at its third congress, the foundation of the Vanguard Party, the Marxist-Leninist Party. Workers of the world, unite! Let's build a new world against capitalism. THE WEAPON. THESE ARE THE WEAPONS. Let's build a new world against capitalism. Workers of the world, unite! Down with capitalism! Down with imperialism! Down with capitalism! Down with imperialism! Onward, workers! Onward, workers! Down with capitalism! Down with imperialism! Down with capitalism! Down with imperialism! I've been a glassblower since 1962. I carry the glass from the furnace to the machine. We make close to 3000 cups each day. There used to be many officers here. You could count 2 or 3 officers at every machine. Now that they've all fled to Lisbon, only servants stayed. The ones working here now were servants under the colonial regime. They are producing much more now. Back then, in 1973, the production target was between 60 and 96 million and now, after the revolution, with mass mobilization, production is increasing. In 77... In 77, we managed to produce around 126 million units. Now, in 78, we are prepared to produce around 200 million. We expect to produce even more than we are producing now. Production is important for the sake of the people and their children, and for our country too. Independence brings a new battle with it: national reconstruction. A fight to have food, to have clothes, to have schools, to build houses where workers can live. To produce is to organize this victory. THE WEAPON. THESE ARE THE WEAPONS. The third congress gave us weapons. For keeping up the fight, day-for-day. For fighting with hand tools and hoes. To turn the factory, the farm, the cooperative, the communal village into the instruments that will lead us to a new life. Here are number 7 and number 4. Let's make it into a game. We take the number of dozens and put them in their own dish. We also put the units in another dish. It's addition. So let's add: 4 units to 5 more units. How many are they now? There are 9 units. Alas, not everyone knew it. 5 fingers on one hand. C'mon... 4 on the other hand. 4 on the other hand. That's what's here, isn't it? 5 fingers... 5 cobs, that's right? When there are 4 cobs more, how many cobs are they now? Let's start counting from the hand that has 5, c'mon. One cob... two cob, three cob. - Three cobs. Four cobs, five cobs... At this point, the entire Mozambican people are free. So it should be the people themselves to make the choice. We were surprised when Comrade Sheleman was presented as a candidate to represent us. It's the people who must decide. We can't do as we did before. The kinglet can't govern before the people have decided whether he should be the one to do so. In my opinion, Comrade Sheleman does not deserve to be the representative of this popular assembly. Long live FRELIMO! Long live FRELIMO! When the people present their problems, the wrong decisions are taken, much like the kinglet used to do in colonial times. This is candidate Suha Afaneh. He is a farmer and he lives in Barbarane village. He is here and we must make a decision about him now. Whoever's in favor should raise their cards. All those in favor, cards in the air! The people choose from amongst their own ranks those who will represent them in exercising power. Here are the ones whose voices were never heard. We purify our ranks, we strengthen our unity. THESE ARE THE WEAPONS. I call the peasant Alan Olombe! Cards against Comrade Fátima Amesi! Cards against! Nobody. We all approve. Imperialists can't stand looking at these images. They don't understand how illiterate people can be capable of exercising their own power. They can't bear to see how people that were exploited can be organizing themselves against exploitation. They can't abide an end to robbing, oppression and humiliation. That's why they attack us. HOW DOES THE ENEMY ACT? Armed hostilities against our country are part of the imperialist action plan in southern Africa. These assaults aim to prevent us consolidating our independence. They aim to discredit popular power. Ian Smith is merely a local agent of imperialism. What kind of targets do the enemy choose when they invade our country? Are they defense facilities? Are they military forces? No. These images tell it better. They destroy civilian targets, they attack defenseless people like in Massangena, Mapai, Mavonde, Chioco, Nuro, Gento and Chicualacuala. This bridge is on the main road to Tete. All the Angónia production comes from there. All the Tete and Niassa agricultural machinery, fertilizers and seeds also comes from there. It's no coincidence that this bridge was destroyed. And these trucks? And these buses? These railway wagons? This is the language of imperialism in despair. These images show the damage caused in Chioco Hospital after the cowardly attack carried out by racist troops. What do they mean, all these crimes committed against the Mozambican people, against the young People's Republic of Mozambique? First of all, it means that the Ian Smith regime is openly at war with Mozambique. The intention is to carry the contradictions that oppress the people of Zimbabwe beyond its borders. This man's name is Van der Byl. He's the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ian Smith's racist, minority, and illegal government. In this interview, he was speaking as the Minister of Defense. The question was if their troops were engaged in any hostile activities against FRELIMO while they were invading Mozambique. He replies that no hostile action was mounted against FRELIMO. For Mr Van der Byl, penetrating Mozambique is not a hostile action against FRELIMO. Van der Byl's cynicism, his arrogance, is because he knows that their criminal actions have the support of imperialism. Now he's being asked if the objectives of the Rhodesians changed once they entered Mozambique. He answers that the objective has always been to eliminate the terrorists and thereby defend civilians of Rhodesia. For imperialism, the terrorists are the children, old men, and helpless women that racists will massacre in the refugee camps. The full liberation of Africa, the end of discrimination and of Apartheid, shadows of the past that still protrude into the present, are a sacred duty for all African people and all people of the world. The People's Republic of Mozambique is aware of specific responsibilities it deserves as a member of the United Nations and as a country that is confronted geographically with the last bastions of racism in Africa. The People's Republic of Mozambique will give no ground in fulfilling its internationalist duty. We don't give in to intimidation or blackmail. We don't give in to any attack, no matter how barbarous and cruel. These are the weapons that started the war, here in Cabo Delgado! The cannons you have started with these weapons. The bazookas and parts you have today started with these weapons. The production you have today, groundnut, sesame and nuts, they came from these weapons. We are grateful to all those who helped in and made possible the production of this film. This film was produced exclusively in Mozambique. I.N.C. Laboratories. THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES
