[CREAKING] [TOILET FLUSHING] [WIND HOWLING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [SIREN BLARING] REPORTER ON RADIO: It's been 24 hours since the greatest earthquake every recorded on Earth brought destruction, havoc and a cut in property taxes to the state of California. Seismologists have estimated the quake to be 9.7 on the Richter scale. Reports indicate 250 seismologists dead, as well as 24 million other fatalities, some of them serious. Damage is approximated at $900 billion, plus tax and license. The President, on vacation in Georgia, was unavailable for comment. However, the Vice President told reporters this morning that he thought the quake was, quote, "A real shame." And he went on to say that he had once lost his masseuse in a quake, so he knows how it feels. [SIREN WAILING] The Red Cross is speeding out packets of Rolaids and Alka Seltzer to bring relief to the 168 known survivors and the 18 unknown survivors who were flown to Georgia just an hour ago to attend a prayer breakfast and mock lynching with the President. Death, destruction, untold human suffering. Surely this terrible disaster is nothing to joke about, which reminds me of the story of the Jewish corpse and the body of the L.A. Police Chief who met under what was once Forest Lawn. [CHUCKLES] The corpse says... Well, I'd better not go into that now. I'll tell you later. I'm really tired of this... Oh! Hello, I'm Walter Concrete. [IN WOMAN'S VOICE] And I'm his better half, Barbie Halters. And we've got a special report for you. Can you dig it? And that's just what the folks here on the West Coast are doing, Barbie, as they dig their way out from under 20 feet of culture, the rubble of the freeways, parking centers, oh, cities, movie studios and MacDonald Supper Clubs. There's only one word to describe the scene here, messy. And you know, Barbara, they say that the earthquake only lasted three seconds. [SIRENS WAILING]Three seconds? It just goes to show you how time flies when you're having fun. [BOTH LAUGHING] I would like to explain why we're here. First, to interview any survivors, if we can find them, and to have them tell us their personal human stories... Do you have money... Would you please get away, you filthy man? Get away from here! We're filming here! Dirty, filthy man. I think he's-- he's hurt your suit a little bit there. It's all right. [BABBLING]And secondly, to make a fast buck, [LAUGHING]if you know what I mean. Well, we'll be back with more of this personal report after this important message. Hi, ladies, I'm Dr. Holcomb, your credit gynecologist. I have over 24 locations to serve you. During the grand opening of my new drive-through location in the beautiful City of Industry, I'm offering my spring-cleaning special.

ANNOUNCER: Dr. Holcomb is located everywhere. Si, yo hablo espanol. Medi-Cal accepted. Sodium Pentothol used. Not responsible for personal property left in the waiting room. Hi, I'm Nick Jackelson and I'm an actor, but I'm not acting now. As you know, many actors suffered during the Great West Coast Earthquake. These established professionals need new caps for their teeth, new toupees, and above all, new agents. If you can help, or if you have a brother in the clothing industry, please send your contribution to Western Entertainment Industry Relief Drive. That's W.E.I.R.D., Box 9.2, Los Angeles, Minnesota. Oh, excuse me. Nurse Ratshit said I had to take this pill. [GULPING] Thank you. One of the tragedies of tragedies like this tragedy are that people who have worked all their lives to make something of themselves now find themselves dead. But for those who were lucky enough to have survived the quake, there were other problems, like trying to find lost contact lenses. Hello. Sir?Huh? Oh, oh, good morning, there. Ah, beautiful morning, isn't it? Boy, it's mornings like these that really make a man feel great. You know what I mean? Great. Are--Are you all right, sir? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine, I'm fine. Nothing could be better. I'm terrific. Everything's fine. I don't know how to tell you this, sir, but you look like a nervous wreck. No, no, no, I'm in the wrecking business. That's it, the wrecking business. With all this destruction going on, somebody's got to clean it up. You know what I mean? [LAUGHING] Well, tell me, where were you when the quake happened? Well, you see, I was on my way to my office. PAUL: Mr. Willard, the head of the personnel department was interviewing a prospective employee. Excuse me.Yes? Is this where I apply for the job? You've come to the right place. Is this your resume? Yes, it is.Fine. Be seated right over there, and you'll speak to our Vice President in just a moment. Uh, no, you have to stay seated right there. He's not with us yet. [SIGHS] I'm not going to tell you again. You're gonna have to have some degree of patience. He's in a very short, but a very important meeting. I can't do anything for you personally. Do you understand that? Uh, you seem to have quite a complete resume. You should do very well with it.Thank you. Uh, would you mind if I told you something in the strictest confidence? Sure. Do you see me signaling for you to come over here? I'd rather not broadcast it to the entire office. Now in just a moment our Vice President, Mr. Mislove, will be coming in, uh, in to, uh, in to interview you. [SIGHS] He'll be coming through that door. Now, uh, there is something I have to tell you about him. He has this slight nervous twitch. You're kidding.I wouldn't kid you about such a thing. No. Is it anything like this? Like what? Uh, never mind. I don't have time to banter with you. The important thing is don't call any attention whatsoever to it. [MISLOVE CHATTERING]He's very sensitive. Oh, as a matter of fact, here he comes now. Morning, Mike. Glad to have you back.Morning, Fred. Have a nice weekend? Good to see you got a little color in your cheeks. I had a wonderful weekend. You're looking 100 percent better. This must be the young man here for... Mike, say hello to Bill Nunguesser. Hello, Bill. How are you?Hi. Bill, this is Mr. Mislove. That's Mislove.Mislove. Mislove.Mislove. I don't want to go through it again, Fred. We've been through it many, many times. Get away for a little fishing this weekend? Did I get away for a little fishing!Silly question, wasn't it? You know it, you old son of a gun. I love to fish. Do you fish, young man?Yes, I do. I want to tell you, got in the car about 4:00, beat the rush hour traffic, was up there about 7:00, in bed at 8:00, Fred. That's the way to do it.And I slept like a baby. Huh?Cried all night. Get that, Bill?Did you get that, Bill? I want to tell you, I got up at 5:00 in the morning. I was out in the boat at 6:00. By noon I had filled that boat up with fish, Fred. I want to tell you I caught a seven and a half-pound striped bass. [WHISTLES] [BANGS] [BANGS] Looks like he's got a hook caught in his mouth. Bill, I was hoping I had made myself quite clear. I don't want to repeat. But like I always say, all work and no play makes Mike a dull boy. I'll second that. And Monday morning it's back here in the office, with my nose right down there on the grindstone.Oh, yes. But you know, I hate coming back on Monday mornings. There's always so much work piled up on my desk, it takes forever to clear it off. That didn't take him long at all. Bill, I think a word to the wise should be sufficient. Where's the young man's resume? Oh, here it is, sir. It inadvertently fell on the floor. Oh, all right. Take a look here. Well, well, well, well. I like what I see, young man. But, to be perfectly frank with you, the final decision as to your employment is not up to me, nor is it up to Mr. Willard here. It's up to our President, Mr. Zegler. Who will be entering in just a moment. He'll be coming through there.Right over there, Bill. Now, uh, let me just tell you something about Mr. Zegler as a word of warning. Bill, he has a peculiar sort of a little... Yeah, yeah. I think I know. I think I know. Did you say anything to him?Not a word, no. Well, let me just tell you, uh, not to call any attention to it and, uh, please make your questions very brief. He's a very busy man and he can't stay too long. As a matter of fact, I think here he comes now. Good morning, sir, I'd like you, uh... He didn't stay long at all. Bill...Here he comes now. How about a chair for the chief?A chair for Mr... [GRUNTING] Hey, nice catch! [EXCLAIMS] Good morning, Paul.Good morning, Michael. Good morning, Fred. Morning, sir.Paul, I'd like you to say hello to Bill Nunguesser here. Hello, Bill, I'm Mr. Zegler. Zegler.Zegler. Zegler.Zegler. Zegler! Smart boy. I like him already. Let's see. Got the young man's resume? Right there. Ready to go, chief.Terrific. [ALL GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [EXCLAIMING] Well, you're about to leave on a very important business trip, aren't you? Yes, I got to take a trip to Cleveland, New York and L.A. How are you traveling? [GRUNTING] I think he's gonna fly. Bill. BILL: Well, he'll never get that load off the ground. Bill... [EXCLAIMING] Well, let's, uh, let's not rush things. Let's relax for a moment. How about a drink?Oh, I'd love it. I'm a little thirsty. Yes, siree.Why don't I get the drinks? Uh-oh.Good idea. Bill, I hope you'll join us. Uh, what's your pleasure? [BANGING] A Harvey Wallbanger. Good thinking. I... Every time, uh, have drinks... Here we go, don't mind the fingers. [LAUGHING]Oh, here we go. Well, this will go down easier than any coffee. I don't think I'm out of line proposing a toast. Here's mud in your eye. ALL: All right. I like him. I like him a lot. Paul, why don't you tell Bill here a bit about what it is we do at this office? Well, as you know, Bill, we are in the wrecking business. BILL: That's quite obvious. Bill. And most of our work does take us outdoors. BILL: You don't do too bad indoors, either. Bill. [SPUTTERING] I believe what Mr. Zegler is trying to say is we need someone to stay here in the office and more or less keep things nailed down. Why don't you start with his shoe? Bill. [EXCLAIMING] Well, uh, time is wasting. I think we should make a decision. Don't you?Yes. Well, I think I like the young man, Michael. Let me put it to him right now. Bill, do you think you can fit in here at the firm? Sure, why not. All right!Got a terrific style. That I like. Let's hire that young man. Is it settled?Yes, siree. Then why don't we go to lunch?Why don't we all go together? Terrific! [ALL GRUNTING] [BILL BANGING HEAD] [WOMAN SCREAMING] [SIREN WAILING] Hey, baby.Yeah, yeah. [CATCALLING] Whoo-hoo! [CHOIR SINGING] Only yesterday, this edifice was a magnificent church known as the Simple Shrine. Now, as you can see, it's shot to hell. The church's leader, Sister Simple, is here. Sister, how do you account for your miraculous survival? Survival? What survival? I'm dead. Yesterday was the day of reckoning. Isn't it wonderful? We made it. We're all saved! But, Sister, how do you account for all-- all the dead people? What else would you expect to find in heaven? [SISTER SIMPLE LAUGHS] Oh, the Lord works in wondrous ways. I can't believe it. Sister Simple. Reverend Billy. I thought you were dead. I am dead, Billy, and you're dead, too. Well, I knew you could heal yourself. Oh, praise be. Isn't this something, Sister?It's wonder... Excuse me, Sister, but where were you when the earthquake struck? What earthquake? It was no earthquake. It was the hand of God! Hallelujah. And I was there in my sanctuary for the downtrodden just praying away. [ORGAN PLAYING]Hallelujah. And I laid my hand upon the altar and it moved. [CONGREGATION APPLAUDING] We're going to hear the most inspirational story of one Mr. Morris Goodheight. Mr. Goodheight, if you could come and just... Welcome to our service. [ALL CHEERING] Yes, right into the studio. Yeah. You need not be frightened. Sit right down. Yes. Now tell us. [HISSING] Early in your life... Early in your life, you were afflicted, were you not? You had an affliction, did you not? Early in my life, I was afflicted. Yes. As I was a small boy growing up in Boise, Idaho, I turned from God and I was afflicted. [ALL CHEERING]My baby teeth could not come out. They would not come out and they would not come out and they would not come out. Can you imagine? Can you imagine the trauma of these tiny recalcitrant teeth? And then what did you do? And then one day they all came out on the same day. [ALL GASPING] And then the very next day, all my grown-up teeth all came in crooked! Crooked? Crooked teeth in a crooked mouth from a crooked life. Yes. And then what did you do? Then my parents took me to a dentist. A dentist? But what could a dentist do for you? He put braces on my teeth. Oh, these must be those tiny braces, a symbol of your torture and suffering. These are the very same ones. Yes, and what are these rubber bands, Mr. Goodheight? Extra suffering. Extra suffering. Extra suffering. Oh, how long did this extra suffering go on? I had them on for 25 years. [ALL CHEERING] And they did not work, and they did not work, and they did not work. And that is what brought you that night to our service at the Simple Shrine, isn't it? And you came a-running down the aisle and right up onto the stage and you said something to me that time that I will never forget. [AUDIENCE MEMBERS ENCOURAGING] What was that you said to me at that time? Share that with all of us here. Help.Help. He said, "Help."I said, "Help." He said, "Help." And I laid my hand upon your mouth and then what happened? And then only a week later I went back to the dentist and he took the braces off and my teeth were all straight. Oh, and show us. Show us the wonderful teeth. [AUDIENCE CLAMORING] It's truly amazing, is it not, Mr. Goodheight? Well, now you can go anywhere and you can eat anything. Even apples in company. ALL: Yeah! And I owe it all to you.Oh, no, no, no. You are the one who saved me. You are the one...[SCREAMS] No! Because you see, Mr. Goodheight, these hands are merely magnets in the force field of God's power. [CONGREGATION AGREEING]And that brings me back to God, back to His scripture. Job, Chapter 8, Verse 2. "Oh, how long will thou speak these things, "and how long will the words of thy mouth "be like a strong wind." Oh, yes! AUDIENCE: Praise the Lord!Because I believe. Praise the Lord!Oh, I believe! Praise the Lord!I believe in me! [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] We'll be back with more of this disaster after this commercial break. Hey, whitey, so you're prejudiced, huh? Hey, hey. I can dig it. It's all right. A lot of people are prejudiced, man. Got a goldfish that's prejudiced against house cats. [LAUGHS] You know it's a big thing, Jim. See, a lot of you jive turkeys don't want to admit when you're prejudiced. Now you walking around saying things, "Oh, yes, I love black people." Hey, look, don't give me that jive. I know you don't love black people. I don't even love all black people myself. See? So don't be giving me that jive. But look. Hey, dig this. A lot of doctors even feel that the aggression between races is pure, natural and inherited. It's like the American way. You understand? Now you can get all that pent up hostility out of you with the Nigger Boppers. Here's how it works. You see a black dude walking down the street with a white chick. [LAUGHS] Get him with the Nigger Boppers. Right there, man. Or if you see a black guy rob a liquor store, hit him with the Nigger Bopper. Hey, maybe you got a black chick that's trying to invade on a lily white classroom. Get 'em with the Nigger Bopper. Oh, hey, they love it, man. They can take the pain. It ain't no big thing. You understand? Hey, for you black brothers out there, we also have the Honky Stoppers. Yeah. [GUN FIRING] [MAN SCREAMS]Oh, I'm sorry. Hey, got one. [MAN GROANING]Is he all right? He's dead? [PEOPLE CHATTERING] MALE REPORTER: Well, the Pasadena Rose Bowl Parade is one of the few events that was not cancelled due to the earthquake. FEMALE REPORTER: And as you can see, John, the parade, it's not as spectacular as in years past. No, it's not. But it is an impressive display of civic pride. Oh, and here is Miss Joan Carson. She is this year's Rose Bowl Parade Queen. And, uh... She's lovely. Oh, yes, and she would have even been more spectacular had not her float been sunk by that tidal wave. And she is followed by the sole survivor of the Southern California Drum and Bugle Corps. Oh, yes. And who is that with her? Oh, and that is drum majorette, Chris Jones. And you know, the football game, uh, today should be very, very interesting considering the very few survivors left on both sides. Mmm-hmm. Should be fun. Well, Barbie Halters here again in the midst of the trouble and the rubble, and it's time to talk earthquake fashions. Well, hemlines are bound to tumble this season as we... Excuse me.Well, what... What have we here. Another survivor. And what's your name, sir? Uh, Peter Francis Zafranski. Huh, Zafranski. French. Francis.Ah, Polish. Polish-American, yeah.Yes, well what are you doing here? Well, this used to be my office. This was the world head quarters of the Society for Polish-American Understanding. I was the executive director. Oh, this must be a terrible tragedy for you. It looks better. Oh, really?Yeah. Well, where were you when the earthquake hit? Well, it's an interesting story. I was down at the Radio Shack trying to pick up our TV program on one of the FM sets. Our machine broke. We produce a television program that's seen in the Midwest. It's a kind of like a black journal without the blacks. [LAUGHS] Very interesting, I'm sure. Well, it's easy to shoot. ANNOUNCER: SPAM, the Society for Polish-American Understanding presents Polibus, a smart look at the many-sided world of what it means to be both Polish and American and still Polish, too. Now here's your guide throughPolibus, Alistair Kakowski. Good morning, and welcome to the Polibusshow. With me this afternoon are many human Poles who will help show you the positive side of Polarization. The act of being Polish-ed. [VOICE DRONING OFF] But first this brief Polospective. [INSTUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] When was the last time you was in New Jersey, New York? If the answer is, "Yes, I have," then maybe you've enjoyed a beautiful place called Palisades Park. ALISTAIR: But did you know that this jewel of the lower Hudson was first called Polisades Park? Yes, that's right. Are you sitting down? With me today is... With me today is Dr. Edward O'Mazuraski, a Polish person who now calls Ireland his home where he does things. Dr. O'Mazuraski...Welcome. Thank you. Being from Ireland like you are, and being Polish to boot, too...Yes. ...I guess that a guy could say about you that you are the only fellow what could get away with wearing his shamrock on top of his undershirt. [LAUGHING] Yes. That was a joke. Dr. O'Mazuraski, sitting here, is a regular Bennett Cerf type scholar. [LAUGHING] I wouldn't say that.It's true. A scholar of Polish folk humors. True Polish folk humor comes directly from the hearts, you see. From the, uh, oh, the, uh... The tits? Could you perhaps share with our audience the best of such tales? Well, certainly you mean one of the best. No, the best. [STAMMERING] The very best? All right. I'll give you my own particular favorite then. This goes back some years. I hope you don't mind that. I first heard this when I was a small boy in the Polish section of Cork. And it goes something like this. In a small Polish village, in the dead of winter, under a thick silent mantle of snow, the stars twinkling out overhead one by one, and these two Jews were stranded on a desert island. So, uh, Haime says to Shlaime, he says, uh, he says, "I've got a confession to make. "I slept with your wife." Shlaime looks him right in the eyes and says, "My wife? "Why, I thought she was your wife." [LAUGHING] Dr. O'Mazuraski, thank you for yours was truly a pleasures. And with that interview, I can see that our time, like a elevator falling to a stop, has flown, so on with the show. Until next time, this is Edward... This is Alistair Kakowski saying, remember, only you can prevent Polish people from catching on fire. Thank you and you're welcome.

Uh, Professor Ceedee, could you tell me what causes quakes? Well, that's rain. The condensation from the clouds. Well, really? I--I always thought it was a build up of gasses. No, I think you're describing the symptoms of heartburn, which I can tell you've got a little of by your breath there. I'm sorry. But, uh, Professor, rain doesn't cause quakes. Oh, quakes?Yes. Oh, I thought you said lakes. Rain causes lakes. Oh, but the quakes, you see, the quakes are caused by the pressure building up in the Earth and forming a jam-like substance. Uh-huh, I see. And what do you scientists call this jam-like substance. Jam. We call it jam. It comes in three flavors: Chicken, shrimp or clam. Now, wait a minute. Jam causes earthquakes? Well, why not? Of course, it also causes heartburn, you see. Excuse me, Professor, but I have to ask you a question. Why is it that all you scientists always speak with a German accent? Oh, well, actually I'm an American actor, but they're overdubbing my voice in German. [INAUDIBLE] I see. Well, let me ask you one more question. Uh, what causes the Earth to crack? Well, that's, uh, anxiety. A-A-Anxiety?Yes, anxiety. You see, the Earth is like us. It's very sensitive, and when the pressures are building up in the Earth sooner or later they have to crack open. [BOTH SHOUTING] Attention all red-blooded tax-paying American He-men. This is Johnny E. Pluribus Unum Johnson at Stalwart Fashions and Furniture, 116,732 East George Washington Boulevard in Helicopter. Men, don't let the queers tear our country to pieces. Come on down to Stalwart and see the beautiful made-in-USA double-knit queer bait sports coats we have special now. These are the same kind of coats Eastwood and Bronson wear when they go out queer-huntin'. With extra-wide shoulder vents so you'll be ready for action when those commie, high-heeled chorus boys accost you in the men's room. And they will, by God. Just last week I saw some watery-eyed little puke face looking over towards me. I cold-cocked him, you bet. That phony Roman collar didn't fool me. So men, come on down and get a free subscription to Guns-A-Plenty Magazine when you get one of these fine queer catcher jackets. And you, young boys, you boys between the ages of 10 and 12, any time you want to come and help Uncle Johnny clean his gun, I'll be glad to have you. So long, everybody. Keep in shape. ANNOUNCER: And now a word from the College Hygiene Society. Oh, hi, boys. Coach Bender here with another handy hygiene hint. Now, we all know that plenty of sleep, and good fresh vegetables are all we need to keep sharp up here, but what about down there? Well, let's pull it out and have a look at it. This is it. In His wisdom he gave it two functions. The second one is dirty, so daily cleaning is a must. Wash it thoroughly, especially near the beak. If it becomes excited, dry it off and leave it alone. Never play with it. Too much handling will make it vomit. When you're finished, put it back where it belongs, and concentrate on thoughts of sports or study. Remember, you control it. Don't let it control you. All right, Smith, suit up. Time for practice. [SIREN WAILING] What's happening here? Home. Hey, baby, don't worry about a thing. I know you hurt right now. You can't talk to me. Don't worry about it. Rock me all night long. [HUMMING]In startling contrast to what we've seen so far, here's a man who seems to be taking the earthquake quite well. Hello there, sir, and what is your name, please? You know my name. Hey, Mom, it's me, Bob. Wow. Your hair, it's on fire! Don't worry about it. Let me get it for you.Wait! Please...

That's District Attorney. Oh, really?Yes, yes, yes. That's the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help me, Leroy. Well, how did the earthquake affect you? Oh, the earthquake didn't affect me at all, Mom. Not at all. Well...I loved it. As a matter of fact... Well, then, how did you get into this state? Oh, see, my family moved here from Duluth. No, no, no, sir. You don't understand. Yes, you was there. You know about it. No, no, I mean what-- what was happening to you when the earthquake struck? Oh, that, well, see, I came in to the office.

We've got this narcotics case we've got to try today. Now, what's the story with this thing? Oh, it's just some smart college kid we busted. He had two lids of street dope on him. That's all. No jive? Any priors? Nah, it's his first offense. All right, let's send this kid up the river for five years. Look, look, let's make an example out of these kids. Absolutely. Let's make it 10 years.

[SIREN WAILING] One of the biggest problems in treating survivors of the earthquake has been the total destruction of hospitals, and so a makeshift medical center has been set up here, and here's one of the doctors who has been doing such an heroic job, Dr. Harvey Holcomb. [WOMAN CRYING]Uh, Dr. Holcomb, you're doing just a wonderful job here. How many patients would you say you've treated so far? Oh, I would say about 20,000. Excuse me, Doctor, they say there are only about 168 survivors in this area. Well, that's not my fault. There were complications. [WOMAN MOANING]See my attorney. Doctor, that will not be necessary. Oh, good, because, uh, 'cause I don't have any malpractice insurance. [MAN COUGHING]Doctor, they tell me that until yesterday you were a practicing gynecologist. Is that true?Yes, it is. Well, it must be quite an experience for you to be working on other parts of the body. Yes, but the examinations are nearly as interesting. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a very important operation to take care of. It looks like a very unusual case. And here he comes right now. Good heavens, I would say so. Excuse me, sir. What-- What in heaven's name happened to you? I don't know. One minute, I was going to the toilet and then the earthquake hit and the next minute I was the toilet. Well, we'll have to have this lanced.Yes, please. Nurse, nurse, come over here. Let's take... You better take care of him right now. And, uh, yes. [TOILET FLUSHING] Hey, hey, hey, pretty powerful pud you're packing there, partner. Hey, hey, hey, how's that hammer hangin', Harley? Hey, hey, hey, I bet that's the tallest tallywhacker in the Tri-State Area. Hey, hey, hey, I bet they call you King Dong. Hey, hey, hey. You peed on your leg. [STUTTERING] That's all, folks. [SIREN WAILING] I'll be with you folks in a second, I only have two hands, which is more than I can say for you. One of the incredible things about the people I've met here is that they've been able to come through this horrifying experience with a realistic and level-headed manner. And here's another survivor, right here. Hello, how many in your party? Well, it's just one of me.One for lunch. If you'd be seated, we have a nice table right here. Our earthquake special today is scrambled eggs. No, I--I don't want any, uh...Perhaps a nice tossed salad? No, I really don't care for...Perhaps a milk shake? Please, I'm not here to eat. Oh, you're not. Oh, we're gonna have to clear this table then, sir. We're expecting quite a heavy luncheon crowd. No, please. You don't understand. I'm with Channel 8, and we're interviewing the survivors of the earthquake. Oh, could I have an autographed 8 by 10. I'd love to put one up on my wall, if I can ever find it. I'll be very happy to send you one a little later. Uh, but could you tell me right now, where were you when the earthquake struck? Uh, the earthquake. As I recall, I was here in my diner. It was late at night and there weren't many people, and we were just about getting ready to close and I remember my chef said to me... Hey, Danny.Hmm? It's like a morgue in here tonight. Do you want to close up? Ah, I hate like hell to close up this early on a Saturday night. Yeah, I know what you mean. Hey, wait a second, I see some headlights coming down the highway. Maybe they'll pull in here.He's got to. I put up the barricade. Good thinking. Yeah here he comes.I'll go get him. Drag him in.Yeah. [BELL RINGING]This way, sir. Danny, customer. Good evening, sir. Can I help you? Yes, I'd like a hamburger.Fine, do you have a reservation? No, um, I'll just go down the road. Perhaps we can accommodate you. Let me check with our maitre d'. Michael? Michael?What? Customer for seating at the front station here.Oh! Oh! Excuse me. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Can I help you? Uh, I'd like a hamburger.I see, sir. Do you have a reservation? No, uh...No reservation here. How many in your party this evening, sir? Just myself. Table for one at this late notice, that's going to be rather difficult. I'd like to keep the counter area open if I could. I'd like to keep that area clear. I'd like to keep this whole section open, if possible. Could we squeeze him into table number one, just temporarily? It's up to you, Danny, you're the boss.Okay, yeah. All right, fine. Sir, would you step this way please. And, oh, please sir, one second. Before you enter our dining room, I must inform you, we have a very strict jacket-and-tie policy here at Danny's. Oh, that's all right, I'll just go down the road.

Would you allow me to choose a wine that I think might compliment that very nicely? You know, Danny, I think the Bourgeois '73 might be very nice. An excellent suggestion. Allow me to check our stock.All right, fine. All right, sir, what would you like to start with? A hamburger. La hamburger ordinaire. An excellent choice, sir. I will have to rush this order in because, as you may or may not know, there's no serving during the show.Show? [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

I want to tell you about the first two days I was there. I wasn't feeling too good, so I went to a doctor. I said "Doc, Doc, it hurts me every time I do this." He said, "So don't do that." [DRUM ROLL]He said, "You ever had it before?" I said, "Yeah." He said, "You got it again." All right. Hey, you having fun? Come on, folks, I know you're out there, I can hear you breathing. Hey, Danny, is this microphone on? Is that an audience or an oil painting? These are the jokes. I went to an another doctor the week before and I told him my problem. He said, "Sir, you don't understand, I'm an animal doctor." I said, "Doc, you don't understand, it's not me, it's my wife." [DRUM BEATING SLOWLY] I don't want to say my wife is fat, but when she sits around the house, she sits around the house! [DRUM BEATING] What's your problem, sir, you don't like comedy?

Well, we've got reports that 5,00,000 Orientals, apparently from the People's Republic of China, have surfaced in an area once known as Bakersfield. Scientists theorize that the shift in the Earth's crust has sent Shanghai to Bakersfield in what may be the biggest Chinese take-out in history. Well, Barbie Halters here, still in the midst of it. More of our special report in just a moment after these important commercial messages. [HONKING] Hi there, gear jammers. [INSTRUMENTAL COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] How's the old highway treating you, huh? Ramblin' Ralph, here. Here to tell you about something new. It's Big Didy, the modern he-man's way to take care of sanitary needs. Hey, listen up, babycakes. Who wants to go to a filthy gas station restroom, huh? Or a bus terminal john full of prying eyes and pay toilets? Oh, no. No more dime-a-dance for this baby. I answer nature's big, two-hearted call when I want, where I want, ridin' along in my semi, out in the woods, standin' in line for fight tickets. I never have to worry about the big ET, Eliminative Tension, forcing me to miss part of the action. Now, hey, I know what you're thinkin'. When I first told my huntin' buddies about it, they pooh-poohed the idea, too. But now they all wear 'em. So take it from me, Ramblin' Ralph. Wear Big Didy. Be your own man and go your own way. MALE NARRATOR: Big Didy. Just $7.98. Available at fine truck stops everywhere. Extra, Governor kills Bill, his lover. Extra. Hey, uh, Miss, can I have one of those papers, please?

I'm the only one from the paper left. Well, then, why in heaven's name are you selling newspapers? Well, the people have a right to know. It's our First Amendmental right to say what we want freely. Why if this had happened in Russia, no one would have known what happened. Of course not, they all speak Russian over there. What are you, a communist? No, I'm a columnist, and that's why I'm a television reporter because that's the way we tell people the real truth. TV news?That's right. You call that truth? What a joke. You can't compare TV news to a newspaper. Why, you can't even wrap fish in your news. Well, our news smells as bad as yours does sometimes. And you don't even have a classified, do you? No, we don't have a classified. But we don't need a classified. The truth is there for people to see. Well, before the earthquake, we had a classified. Probably the best classified in the world. [MUTTERING] Oh, God. God. I can't believe this. I... Well... No. I do not believe this, I will not believe this, I cannot believe this. Hello, Louise, yes. Did that rock and roll promoter ever arrive? How many rock and roll promoters do I know? The one who's gonna take out the full-page ad? Did he ever show up? I'll bet he didn't. Oh, he did.

What's the matter, don't you like your own? Hey, that's a little joke. "Don't you like your own?" I enjoy a joke as well as the next man, but, for business purposes, would you tell me your name? My name is Anthony Francis Fligella. Mr. Fligella, I thought so, I recognized you in a minute. Anthony Francis, huh? Do your friends kid you a lot about being named Francis? They use to.

Forget what it says on the door. Just swinging in and out there all day long, huh? A swinging Hard-On.Yes, Mr. Fligella, thank you. Now you are what we know in the business as an old friend. Is that what I am?And we have a saying which says, "Old friends mean new sales, and that's what friends are for." You said it right there.And isn't that true? You came to us 12 years ago, you had just been married, and you bought a fine honeymoon bedroom set. Yeah, that's right, you know that, huh?Yes. And I remember your lovely wife. Her name escapes me, uh... Rosemary.Rosemary! Hey, that's pretty good. Thank you.A lovely woman. Are you still married to the same...Same old bag. She's outside jumping on the furniture. The honeymoon is over, isn't it?It was over 12 years ago. We can't live with them, we can't live without them. Can we? You know, can I be frank with you?Sure, Frank. Frank Hard-On, huh? Strange name, Frank. Uh, Tony, I'm afraid you misconstrued me. Hey, I never touched you.Oh, please, I do not come down here to be made a jackass out of. No, where do you go?Mr. Fligella, I beg your pardon. I'm a business man. A very busy man. And I do not approve of your jocularity. Now, uh, what I'm trying to say... Does it show through here, I just got them last week and I, uh... I'm afraid you are very close to an idiot. Hey, I'd better move away then, huh? Do you want to carry on a conversation with me or not, Mr. Fligella? Hey, you called me in here. Sorry.All right. Now, uh, do you know where the problem starts in a marriage? Where the problem...It starts in the bedroom, Mr. Fligella. That's the place. You're right.On the wedding bed. On the connubial couch.On the old conubo. Now you've been married 12 years, I've been married about that length of time. No kidding? How's your bag?Pardon? I said, Mrs. Hardon? Mrs. Hardon, yes, a lovely woman. I'm proud of her. She stands behind me in everything I do. I bet she does.But the point I'm getting to is, um, if yours, after 12 years, is anything like mine, it's starting to lose some of its firmness, starting to slunk a little in the middle. Starting to a slump and, uh... Am I right? Slump in the middle?Yes. Starting to sag just a bit. It happens with the passage of time.You, uh... You been talking to my wife?No, no, no. Now the thing is, do you every turn yours over from time to time. Use it on both sides? Turn it over?Mmm-hmm. It keeps it from getting very lumpy. Also, does your wife ever take it out in the backyard and throw it over the clothesline and give it a good hard beating? Just whip the devil out of it!Over the clothesline? It's good for the circulation. Does your wife do that? Well, no. We have a women, comes in once every other week and does it. Yeah, well, you're a sales manager, you can afford it. Now, you know what you can do, Tony?What's that? If I can talk to you man to man. One thing you could do, you could put a little board underneath of yours. Put a little board under it?Yes, your wife doesn't even have to know it's there. I'm going to put a board under it. And she's not going to know it's there? Of course. No, no.You must know my wife. But the point is, that's going to help her, it's going to help you, it's not going to help me.I don't think so. Now, you know, forget about size. I should forget about size.Size is not important. Now, of course, you may think I'm a hypocrite. As you may or may not know, I have a super king size one. Well, you're a big man.Well, it's not so much for me. My wife gets more of a kick out of it than I do. Oh, I bet she does.Every Wednesday night her bridge club comes over. She takes the ladies upstairs and throws open the bedroom door and says, "Look at that. Isn't it a beauty?""Isn't it a beauty?" I say, "Dear, could you at least throw a sheet or a cover over it or something?" A big spread, or something.I think I have a photograph of it. Maybe you'd like...That's all right, I'd rather not see it if you don't mind.Ah, as a matter of fact, it was in our showroom window over the holidays.It was in your window, huh? Yes. Well, we had a Santa Claus and eight tiny reindeer running down the center of it. Yeah, yeah, bet you were going to hang some cookies from it, too. That's a wonderful thought. We hung a wreath with... All right, look mister, uh... I was afraid the cookies would attract mice.Ah, yeah, look... Now, the thing is, I wouldn't be a bit surprised if your wife didn't come by In the window? She...Yes, of course. I'm going to kill her.Hey, no, wait a minute, wait! Let's keep this between you and myself. Ah, you know, forget about length. That's what I'm trying to say. I should forget about length?Yes. Concentrate on width.Width. Okay. A man like yourself, I would say, would maybe need another eight, 10, 12 inches. Just another foot in width and that could solve a lot of your problems. Just another foot in width and that's going to solve all my problems? Yes, of course, yes, yes.Just another foot. I had a friend who had very, uh, two very narrow ones. Two narrow ones?Two very narrow ones, yes. And it was driving his wife crazy. Oh, I'm sure, she didn't know which way to turn. No, and funny, she said, "What's wrong with us, why don't we slide them together "at night and make one large wide one?"Yeah, sure. Now, you, uh... He was a circus performer.I bet he was. Does he work in a sideshow?I'm not sure. You know, you look more to me like the queen size. Now what's that supposed to mean? Well, I happen to know you have one of the smallest ones in the city. You been talking to my wife...No, no, it's written here in our pamphlet that goes out to 150 cities around the country. You got that written in your pamphlet? What are you putting stuff like that in the pamphlet for? Let's look ahead. How can we...Let's see. No, wait a second, now, I want to ask you something. You... Do you... Are you familiar with this Hugh Hefner? Hugh, who?He publishes Playboymagazine. Oh, the guy with the bunnies.Yeah. Oh, yeah, sure, I read that, hey, come on.Well, who doesn't? We're all guys, right?He has a round one. Does yours rotate all night long? If I want it to.Oh. Could I ask you something. Do you plug yours in or do you operate it by hand? Well, I like to start it by hand and then plug it in.Mmm-hmm. No energy shortage in your house, is there?No, sir. A lot of my friends have theirs filled with water. From time to time. Well, does it ever spring a leak in the middle of the night? Well, occasionally. That can be dangerous. You flood the floor and the apartment downstairs... Hey, not that much. Your wife can't jump up and down on it in those stack heels, can she? Well, um, you know, it's complicated, isn't it? Yeah.Remember the good old days? Were you in the Armed Forces? Sure.Who worried about those complicated things? You got up in the morning, you rolled it up into a tight little roll, you threw it on your shoulders and took off on a hike. Remember? You and I were in different armies. [LAUGHING] But we served, didn't we?Keep your hands off me. I'm going to ask you a very personal question, Tony.What's that? How many rooms in your house? Counting the bathroom?Yes. One and a half.One and a half? Yeah.Have you considered having a foldaway? A foldaway.A foldaway. What you do when you're done with it, is you just--just slam it into the wall. Just slam it in the wall?Of course, and it's out of sight. And the beautiful part about it is your friends say, "I know he's got one, but where does he keep it?" He's jamming it in the wall! That's what he's doing! Of course. One more question, then we should go out in the front and look at some stock.Oh, yeah? Urn, have you considered having a spare?A spare? Yes. I imagine at the present time you only have one. Yeah, I only got one. What do I look like? Well, a man in your position should have more than one. You have friends coming over to spend the weekend? Your wife, Rosemary, I believe she has a very lovely sister. Is that right?Yeah, you know it. She's beautiful. If your sister-in-law comes to spend the weekend, do you want her to have to use the same one your wife has been using? Why the hell not? She has been all these years. Let's go outside. I have a salesman... Both go out there? I don't want to... I think he's showing it now.Yeah, I bet you he is. He shows it to my wife, I'll kill him. Goodbye, Ramon! Don't forget to write!

Oh, you filthy man, I told you to get away from me. Keep this man off the set while we're filming here, please. You know, the real irony is that the stories I've heard are the kind of tales that the victims of the quake would've liked to have told their grandchildren if they or their grandchildren had survived. WOMAN: ...but you forgot these. Good heavens, ladies and gentlemen, another survivor! What are you doing in my bedroom? Everything is all right, please. Where is my bedroom? It's all right, you survived a terrible earthquake. My TV set's gone.That's all right. You're on television right now. Oh! Oh... Oh, uh... Gee, I must look terrible. No, you look fine. Just tell us what happened to you during the earthquake. Listen, have you seen anybody who looks like this? Well, I'm-- I'm afraid we need more of a description than that to find someone. Blond hair. He was about this tall. Oh, I don't... Was this person close to you? Oh, yes. He--He was very close to me. He'd come over to see me.Yes. Well, we were-- we were on his bed.Oh, really? Yes, we... As a matter of fact, after a while, we got on to the bed. We were just... We were just sort of having a romantic interlude. I understand. The kind between two people who are just meeting for the first time and yet have known each other for a long time. Do you know what I'm saying? That wonderful, crazy, let-go-of-yourself feeling. [MOANING] Mmm, yes, yes. [LAUGHING] Oh, yes, that's the stuff. [MOANS] Oh... Yeah... Oh... Oh... Tom Snyder. Over there. Tom Snyder. Turn it on.Where? On the television. In the background, I like it. Hmm. It's on. Cover his face with a towel. A towel?Yes, just his voice. TOM: Good morning, everybody, and welcome to...Yeah... [MOANING] [EXCLAIMING] All right. Come at me, baby. We're been joined this morning by two guests, only one of whom was originally scheduled to be with us this morning. And I think that discrepancy, if you will, deserves some explanation here at the outset. Mr. Carl Adler is a Cuban refugee and a former field operative with the Central Intelligence Agency down in Miami. He was originally scheduled to be with us a week from Thursday until he got some information from sources of his down in Florida that he was scheduled to be killed by the CIA within the next six days and he asked if he could be squeezed in here this morning and, of course, we agreed. [MOANING] What was your job at the CIA? What were you, sir, chief bottle washer or what? I... I... Uh... No, I was not a bottle washer. Just, see, there is the system inside CIA whereby all our deadly poison are sent to our agents in the field through the mail. In this whole structure, this complicated scenario, what was your specific function, sir? I was the poison tester.Okay. [TOM CONTINUES CHATTERING] Chris.Yeah? What's wrong? Uh, you don't know?No. What? Well, I'm feeling a little, um, kind of a lot, uh, sort of impotent, you know. [ALL LAUGHING] ADLER: I should live so long. I should. No big thing. Really, except once when I was in high school and I was puking then anyway, so it doesn't count. TOM: Sir, I gotta ask you, how come you are sitting here in front of 5, or if we're lucky, 6.2 million people if you're under that kind of a death threat? How come you are not home or--or in hiding or at least getting yourself a better disguise? Well, I have asked myself the same question, Tom, over and over and over and over, and I have always come up to myself with the same answer. Yes, sir.You know, Tom, I was not born in this country. I didn't know that, sir.I'm what they call a nationalized citizen. Yes, sir. And, uh, and so I feel I owe it to the people of this country to tell them what I know so they can wake up with their eyes open. All right, well, I don't think we can argue with that. I think we could all use a little waking up. Eyes open, eyes closed, at 1:00 in the morning, what's the difference? Sir, what do you know? I know the names of the key people involved in the political murders of... [INAUDIBLE] It's me, isn't it?No, it's obviously me. No, it's-- it's me. Ooh, I look terrible. Now look, it's me. It's just a simple matter of masculine will power, that's all it is, huh. ...which is really just another way of saying more open-minded. TOM: Okay.We all have our little prejudices. I--I--I don't like Negroes.Okay. Don't you worry, huh, baby. I'll take care of this. Okay.Ready? Watch this. [CHATTERING CONTINUES ON TV] [GRUNTING] What the heck was so important about being here this particular morning? What was the big deal, sir? Well, it actually is kind of a big deal, Tom, in--in my field and...How big is it, sir? [TOM LAUGHING] Pretty darn big, really, Tom. Uh... Uh...Just a second. [GRUNTING] Well, Kozitsky says, Tom, that the pyramids, uh, the Egyptian pyramids as well as Mexican and Aztec pyramids...The pyramids. The pyramids. All pyramids were constructed here by visitors from outer space so that they would always have a place to eat when they were on this planet. The first question to occur to me about this luncheonette from outer space or whatever you want to call it...Why not? Were people sitting in there ordering from menus, sir, or was it being done cafeteria style? [MOANING] What's that? [EXCLAIMS] Neighbors! The neighbors again! Those fools.Peeping Toms! He's looking for more? Come here, big boy come here. Give it to me. [BLINDS RATTLING] Oh, ignore 'em, they always want to see some action. Sit! Fools. Oh, you fool, hurry, you fool. You know you want it. You want it as much as I want it. I want it like I've never wanted it before. [LAUGHING] Oh, boy. Boing, boing, boing. [MOANING] They are all part of a plan by CIA. There is that name again. CIA to program the population of this country by the invasion by the Martians. Chris, Chris, where are you?I'm hiding! What're you doing down there?Hiding. Okay. Now listen, big boy. [EXCLAIMING] Hey, hi, there, smoky eyes. Kind of sexy down here, huh?I like it. I like it fine. Come here, you idiot. Give it to me. I mean, nowadays, everybody wants to see the smoking gun, don't they? [MOANING] Oh, yes! We got to put the lid on it right here and now, we live under the tyranny of the clock, if no other. It's been fun. We'll have you back in a couple of months, do it all over...I only got six days. Sir, I only got six seconds. Thank you both for being with us. And now for all the people who worked the late, late shift, here in the heart of New York City, thank you and good night, everybody.
