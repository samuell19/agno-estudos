THE NEW KID - So, how did your week go? - Why? You must've made friends after a week at school. Drop it. Nino has made lots of friends. How many friends have you made? 8. 8 friends! You need to go up to people. They won't come to you. That's how it is. Yeah, I go up to them. He's shy. I was shy, too. But you have to open up. Get off my back. Just one thing: Guys who get their pee-pees out in class... Hey, it happens. Well, those guys end up failures. I promise you. I know one like that. Today, he's... He's a bum. A bit like your uncle. You'll miss me when I've gone. I need to build up my thighs. Why do I have 8 friends and he has no friends? Because he's shy. Why are you shy? There's no point being shy. Can I come in? Yeah. Why don't you take some chocolates to school? - Chocolates? - Yeah. Offer one to someone, ask their name, then strike up a conversation. Think I'll take chocolates to school and say "Be my friend"? Yes, why not? Think I'm a loser? Is anyone hungry? Hungry? Want one? No. You could prepare the pollution part. You talk too quick. Me not understand. You don't understand a thing, do you? I won't pair up with you. Help yourselves. No, beat it. Go do your coloring! What the hell? Give me that. I was giving them some. You didn't dare. Can I have one? Not to a thief. Everyone had one but me. Silence, please. Wow, Charles is on time! Thank you, my friends. Oh, OK, a peck on the cheek. Go sit down. Now be quiet. Astrid! - When's your party? - Mystery! What a girl! Stop being such a girl! Get lost. Go on home. OK, new guy? Yes, thanks. I'm Constantin. I've been schooled here for 3 years. OK. You have to give me this back tomorrow, signed. What is it? It's to sign up for the school choir. Is it compulsory? No, but... lots of people want to sign up for very few places. So, there you are. I'm not really interested in it. You have to tell me now. It'll be too late tomorrow. Well, no, then. It's a year-long commitment. That's a lot of days. So, think it over. Take your time. There's no hurry. When you've made your mind up, come for a coffee. Hey, new guy! You got chocolates? Yeah. Want one? - Did your day go OK? - Yeah. Wow, luxury chocolates! - You pig! - It's for my family. - Where are you from? - Le Havre. Oh, yeah? Who cares?! Cut it out. Why did you move to Paris? - For my Dad's job. - Do you like Paris? Yeah, it's cool. OK, let's go. - Your place? - No, it's too far. - Your place? - My Mom's there. We can screw her! Don't be rude. Don't get me started on your Mom. Where, then? You can come to my place. - Where do you live? - 2 streets away. - OK? - Fine by me. Beat it, altar boy! We don't like you. You're not coming. - It's not your place. - We don't like you, buttface! He'll kill us with his camel breath! Can I come? Yeah, but there's too many of us. OK, fair enough. I'll get my stuff. So, new guy, you should make friends, don't stay on your own. - OK, see you. - Bye. This is for the choir. This way. Is this your room? Yeah, but it won't stay like this. Look at the stickers! You sure like pink, don't you? Pay no attention to it. The old tenants had a daughter. Sure. - Where'd you get 'em? - In the kitchen. - Want some? - No. Well, they're his anyway! I got a joke. You'll laugh at this. So, this guy enters a nightclub. He sits down and orders a bottle of champagne. And the barman says to him: "You didn't pay for a bottle of champagne yesterday." What does the guy say? Champagne! Hello? Why're you laughing? - He says: "Champagne!" - So? What's the joke? When he says "Champagne", it's funny. Why did you laugh? The poor thing! Poor thing! Stop it! He has us over, we make fun of him. Got a Play? This is boring. A console? I think I can find it. So, light B turns orange. What about light A? Excuse me. Hello. Sit down. Meet Aglaée. She'll be here this year. Can someone help her catch up last week's lessons? Go with Emilie. Thanks. Bye. Light B turns orange. Light A turns what? It'll turn white, like your hair! You OK? Yeah. - You're Aglaée? - Yes. So, you're new. You settling in, settling down? Yes, thanks. I'm Constantin. - Hello. - I've been here 3 years. So, basically, if you need anything, just ask. After 3 years, I know my way around. Know what I mean? OK, sure thing. Are you making fun of her? You can get out. Are you insane? Make fun of me, not her. Out! Shut up, weirdo! Can't hear you! It's OK. So, I just wanted... Bye. And also... This is important. If ever anyone does anything to you... mentally or physically, who forces you to do stuff... you tell me. I'll deal with them. What do you mean? Well, sometimes people can be immoral. They might say: "Ah, Aglaée" and spit at you. Or pull your hair. Why'd anyone spit at me? I don't understand. Some people are immoral. They don't think about their actions. But why me? Well, I don't know... 'Cause you're new here. - Don't take it badly. - No, I don't. Thanks. It's just... Enjoy your... Anyway... You too. You can't bullshit me. I possess the swag. Excuse me... Benoit loves Barbies. His room is pink. What did I say? Benoit is homosexual. Stop it. It's not funny. Get to work. Benoit... ow, ow, sodomy. What's your problem? Shut up. Stop it. OK, just stop it. Sit down. I'm going to get very annoyed. We apologize. Not found a presentation partner? I find Sandra, but she choose other girl. It doesn't matter. We'll find someone else tomorrow. OK? It's not too complicated? Can you follow the lessons? Well, it's difficult. Stick at it, Johanna, and it'll be OK. It'll be OK. Bye. Sir? If you like, you can think for other topic. And I think for other topic. OK. And tomorrow choose, you and me. - OK. - Choose other topic. Hej då. - What? - Hej då. Goodbye. Swedish. Bye. We do 3 kisses. - Here. - Thanks. Hej då. They're stupid. They're jerks. - "Jerks"? - Yeah, jerks. What's that? Jerks are mean, they're not nice. - They are jerks. - Yeah. They say... always... things about sex. It's not... I don't like. A hotspot is a point where the heat is constantly increasing. It's close to the surface and melts the rocks... Hey. Me? Want you come my house? Johanna? Yeah, OK. After. Then, the volcano is in...? Erection! Oh, grow up! The lyrics of the song... The man say tired running after the girl. He want the girl... stop... play with him. Like it? Yeah. It's not my kind of music, but I like it. You have one. Me have other. Both have one. For me? Yeah. Like it? Why give it to me? A present. Well, thanks. To Johannify 2 Johannas, you Johannify the 2 Johannas by the same number of Johannas. Result: Johanna. OK? I'm happy you with me. Me too. I don't like... I don't know... I don't like being new. I don't like being new, either. Coming to sit down? No, I wait other someone. Want to sit at our table? No, thanks. You don't want to? Are you sure? If you change your mind... See a black calculator? Uh, no. Mine was stolen a week ago. If you find a black one, tell me. I wrote "Mine" on the back. They must've taken it off. So, if you find it, tell me. I'll tell you, but I'm in a hurry. One last thing... Want to buy a dictaphone? No. This is analog. It's better than the digital ones. I'm in a hurry. I don't give a shit. I'm in a rush. I don't give a shit. I'm in a rush. The purity of the sound. It's amazing. I'm gonna keep it. Sit with us. There's no room. It's OK. I'll go over there. See you later. Sorry. Got a problem? Get lost, sonovabitch. Screw you! Hey, don't annoy my buddy. Can I? Yeah. Water? Oh, you've got some. Let's do a quick poll. Hey, shut up, you lot! Shut up. Who's standing for class rep? Me. Good for you. You're persevering. Who else? You too? Aglaée, too. Who'll vote for me? Cool! Who'll vote for Constantin? Well done, Constantin. We haven't presented our programs. What program? Tell us your program. If I say, you'll just steal my ideas. OK, I'll set up a choir. Screw your choir! What's your idea? Nothing. So, shut up! Who'll vote for Aglaée? Wow, a serious rival. Well done, Aglaée. Not many girls in these elections. Well, the new guy can stand! We go to the park with the boys. You come? With those jerks? No, I have to go home. They're nice. If you come... They not jerks. No, it's OK. I'm off. Bye. Greg! Yeah, I'll do it. I'm busy. - How were you as a little boy? - A normal boy. Benoit... Come here. - What? - Come here. - What? - Sit down. - Your parents are away this weekend. - So? - You want to be popular? - Yeah. - Know what we'll do? - What? We'll get some booze and throw a mega-party, OK? - A party? - A mega-party. A wild night of fun, OK? Go to school and tell everybody: "I'm throwing a big party at my place on Saturday. And my uncle's a DJ. He'll be there." Don't forget to tell them that. I'll get the turntables. But I don't know many people. I'm up for it, but I'm new. I don't know anyone there yet. That's good. You can say: "In my old school, I organized the parties." Yeah, but... It's risky. Tell 'em there's a DJ. - You were a DJ? - For 8 years. I want a crazy party, I want blood on the walls! I want all those kids wasted. So, make a guest list. Invite some chicks from classes above yours. Never any clean glasses. Want a drink? No, thanks. Charles is a baby. Thinking about him is a waste of time. He's so childish. If classmates say I suck my thumb, don't listen to them. They're liars. It's OK, my Mom will clean it. I've cut my own hair for the past 3 years. Want a trim? - What? - Trim the sides. No. - You need it though. Sure? - Sure. Up to you. - Want me to play a tune? - Why not? What's that? It's a list. I've done that since 5th grade. "All the people who badmouthed me, hit me, or stole my stuff." - What's the point? - To remember. - You're weird. - Why? And this? "The people I've had bad thoughts about. Hitler, Mrs. Perez, Charles, Mom..." Never mind that. I'll play you the song. Go on. Shut up, shithead! It's my sister, don't worry. She's a bit... She didn't go to school. For anyone interested... It'll be an opportunity to get acquainted. Excuse me. Excuse me! For anyone interested... I'm having a party. Silence! For anyone interested... I'm having a party on Saturday. Where? You're all invited. All of you and... In my last school, I organized a lot of parties. That was my thing. So... I'm new, nobody knows me, so it's normal. It'll be an opportunity to get acquainted, because, you know... Wait up, Aglaée. What? Why did so many people say they'd vote for you? I don't know. Don't take this the wrong way. I'm not being mean, but I think they said they would, 'cause you're disabled. Really? So? You have an advantage over us. Is that normal to choose the class representative as a good deed by voting for an autistic? Shouldn't people vote for the best candidate? It's... It's, you know... Are you coming to Benoit's party? Let me know beforehand. Coming to Benoit's party? You don't answer me? I'm crossing you off. Let go. You're not invited. There's a buffet, a huge buffet... You have to tell me right away. I need 24 hours' notice. Let's go together. OK, why not? Will you pick me up at 7? OK. Yeah, sure! Where does he live? Near the Eiffel Tower. I'll have to ask my mom. She never lets me go to parties. She's frightened I'll be kidnapped. Johanna... Got anything planned this weekend? It's my party. This weekend? No, I'm in the Loire with my family. - Pity. - I wanted you to come. It's a pity. I love parties. Me too. It's a good idea to have a party. Yeah, but you won't be there. Well, have a good weekend. Yes, you too. - Thanks. See you. - Hej då. Why invite everyone? It'll be chaos. - Yeah. - That's the point. But you've invited everyone. - You don't care? - I don't care. Is it big? Normal size. - Big enough for everyone. - OK? - See you. - On Saturday, I hope. See you Saturday. - What's that? - These are the people I asked. - But they haven't confirmed. - What? What is this? It's the list. - What list? - For the party. Who told you to do that? No-one. I'm just helping. You're showing us up in front of everyone. What's your problem with lists? - Are you bored? Why the list? - I dunno. It's nice, OK, but it's my party, not yours. I can rip it up. But we won't know who's coming. You know... I have an idea. We could invite a clown. Stop. There won't be clowns at my party or magicians. And stop trying to help. Look. Isn't this great? What's it for? Could the owner of the minivan move it? Coco Bongo, Coco Bongo... This perfume is marvelous. I don't know anyone will come now. We can start. Start what? The party. - Yeah, the first one! - Yeah! First! Who is it? A girl? It stinks. Do you stink? It's me! Oh, yeah! Hey, what's that dance? - She's disabled. - I see that. Do you want me to fix you some drinks? We can't open the bottles. - You can't open them? - We want shandy. Know any comebacks? Yeah, sure. I know a few. Go on, then. If Charles says: "Don't bust my balls", you say: "Absent friends!" "Absent friends"? As if he had no balls! Oh, absent friends! He has no balls! - Say "Don't bust my balls." - Don't bust my balls. Absent friends! Good, huh? Very good. So, a guy at school bugs you? Yeah. Charles. He's mean to you? Yeah, to him. What if he says your shoes are ugly? That they're nice. That's no good. If a guy makes fun of your shoes, don't look at them. If he does, look at his. Find something on him. Get it? - Yeah. - No, you don't. I'll give you an example. Make fun of me. Which store sells your shitty shirt? I won't go there. You buy from stores? Don't you steal 'em from dead hobos? I turned the tables. Dead hobos! I turned the spotlight on you. OK, I get it. Say something about me. Is there enough food for you or should we buy more? Same to you. Idiot! Mirror! "Same to you" - that sucks! OK, do another one. Are you always hungry? Are you ever full? When I'm with your Mom! - Yes! - A big hand! Well done! You've understood it. I like singing on my own. But singing in front of everyone in a choir is embarrassing. He's right. I sing on my own. I won't sing in front of people. Why not all sing together? It's illogical. - It's embarrassing. - Illogical! Less noise! I have to get up for 2 PM. That's not early. What's that cake? It smells synthetic. Think that's funny? Yeah, I do. OK, be serious. I'm going to bed, so keep the noise down. What's the code, Benoit? - What? - The code. Why? Who is it? Johanna, the party's over. Don't bother coming up. Are you crazy? Give me that. Bunch of jerks! You fell for it! Think that's funny? I knew. A guy in lipstick! So pretty! - Are you done? - Yes. You two kiss as boy and girl. Oh, yeah! No way. You lost the yes/no game. You're crazy! Do a forfeit. Never! Your turn. Like this game? Absolutely. Think you're good at it? Well, yes. Oh, shit! You lost on purpose. - I wasn't ready. - You did it on purpose. I wasn't ready, I said... Do you like forfeits? Trying to pick me up? Nonsense! Are you sure? You're pretty sure of yourself! Get out if you don't want to. No, I'm not your dog. Why should I get out? Admit it, then. - Admit what? - That you lost on purpose. You're so sure of yourself! Get out, then. - Admit it or get out. - Nothing to admit. - Go on. - Film me. Seriously? Seriously! Bastards! Go on, Greg! Machine-gunfire! List of people I like Ready? Vote for me. I'm a liar, a cheat, a thief. I say rumors about people, 'cause I like to lie. For example, saying a pupil sucks his thumb when it's not true. Or putting a shrimp in a pupil's bag so people think he stinks. Very clever. My name is Charles. Vote for me if you want a schmuck. Great! But if anyone ever finds out I made the video, I'm dead. So, don't say I did. Do you really think people won't know you made the video? It's obvious you did! It's well-made though. Silence, everyone. Charles's father... OK. 06... 87... 21... 72. Loudspeaker... Yo... Put me on to Charles. Who is this? Yo, it's for the delivery. What's all this? It's for the weed delivery, man. Wait, I'll do it to my Mom. I'll do it to my Mom. Be quiet. My Mom! Yeah, Mom? - You idiot! - Oh, yeah! Charles. Aglaée. Shit! Stop it. We can stop now. I've won. Charles wins. Let me tell you all I'll be a good rep. - Meaning? - Screw around... You know, classic stuff. OK. Who's your substitute? Me, me! Where's Piggy? Piggy! Let's continue the lesson. So, what is it? A throat infection. That's what they said. Oh, yeah? Remember when Charles... said: "My substitute is Piggy"? Yes, it was yesterday. So, I'm his substitute. We have to get Charles expelled. Then, I become class rep. I appoint you as my substitute. I disappear, you become class rep. Easy as pie. Yeah, but it sounds a bit complicated. Where will you go? I'll come back under a new name. Don't worry. Coming to class? No, my Mom's coming. - You? - Yeah, coming. OK, bye. You're so lucky. I so don't want to go back to class. So, get sick. Yeah. Will you contaminate me? Are you sick in the head? No, that's just it! How? Well, with saliva. You got problems. Yes or no? No. Are you scared? - Why would I be? - You tell me. You won't get sick right away. Well, we could try. Well, let's try. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - See you. - Bye. Astrid! - What? - We didn't get your invite. You didn't? - No. - What a pity! Don't pretend. We can't invite everyone. We're not invited? No, you're not. You know you're not. Wherever you go, you make a mess. Shut your mouth. We're not coming. Happy now? No way! - You're not invited. - Shut up. You're not invited. Everyone's going. Beat it, you pig. Nor are you. I never am. - Get lost, you stink! - OK, I will. You're not invited to Benoit's or Astrid's. I wouldn't invite you. No-one will. - Charles is a social leper! - Get lost. True. You're an outcast. Take a hike, pig! What a weirdo. I said, take a hike, so take a hike! You should pretend... Listen up. You listen, too. Pretend to be into another girl. - That always works. - How? Girls go crazy when they're jealous. What do I have to do? You make a date with her. She thinks it'll be a hot date. You bring another girl. - Another girl? - Yep. You act real nice to the other girl. You ignore Johanna. It'll drive her crazy. That's crap. If I ignore her, she won't talk to me again. He's got experience. Chicks are so competitive. Maybe you're right. I don't know. If a girl deliberately never speaks to me, could she be using that technique to make me jealous 'cause she loves me? No, I don't think so. Know a suitable girl? I know no girls in Paris. We could ask my sister. Are you sure? - What is she like? - She has big, firm boobs. How do you know? I touched them. - Seriously? - She's family. What a weirdo. Just take these out in the cinema. Count them ever-so-casually, and she'll be impressed. They're photocopied on both sides, so she'll think they're real. - Here. - You're insane. Put 'em away. Take them. Here's my sister. You OK? Hey. - Where's the chick? - What chick? - The one I gotta hit. - You don't hit her. - What did you tell her? - Well, I... I told you to make her jealous. Make her jealous? I told you this morning. Have you forgotten? Just be friendly to him and laugh, to make her jealous. I don't hit her? No, we just talk and laugh and you ignore her. We ignore her, see? Otherwise, it's... Chicks are so competitive. Don't you know that? - Yeah, I do. - She doesn't. What good will it do? Well, I prefer a burger and fries. - What? You said, make her jealous. - Shut up. - Hur mår du? - Hi. What's that shit? "How are you?" Hur mår du? We're in France. It's Swedish. Whatever. Screw that! - Over there. - Thanks. Here you are. They're the same. - What was that? - I blew it. Are you for real? Your face! Look what I did. No need to move. My favorite. And I know that chick. Do you know her? - Yeah. - She's so funny. - Don't shush me! - That's enough. Enough, yourself! Want some? Why did he keep shushing me? Hi there. You not wait too long? No, it's OK. - Why are you here? - Got a date. - Who with? - Johanna. It's OK. I see you at school. Yeah, sure. See you. Who's he? A guy from school. Why's he here? - Let's go. - That loser doesn't stand a chance. He didn't even bring another chick. It's like I had a real salary. What's going on? I'll call you back. What's going on? What's your problem? - What happened? - Get out! Open up. Let me in. Benoit, let me in. It's Johanna. Shut your face! My pussy's on fire, Benoit! Cut it out! Hey, new kid! Give me a bit. - What? - Give me some. You want some? You deaf? Don't argue. Here. He's so dissing you! You're an asshole, aren't you? - Gotta be nice to girls. - Depends who. You're getting too big-headed! What the hell! You free Saturday night? You free? Dunno. Wanna come to my party? Maybe. - Yes or no? - Yeah, why not? Yes or no? I just said yes. One thing, though: you gotta buy me chocolate. She won't give up! Hi. Why... Why you not speak to me? I never said I didn't want to. You are angry? Not at all. You act like you don't want to be my girlfriend. I do want to be your "girlfriend". It's just, you know... What? You hang out with me, then I see you with Charles. Then, with Arthur... I dunno. You're jealous? No. It's just, you know. You mustn't be like that. Because... I want you to be my girlfriend. It's not "girlfriend", it's "friend"! I want you to be my friend. Hi there. Wanna go to Astrid's with me? No, I'm not going. Why not? My Dad wants me to look after my brother. That's a shame. Yeah, I guess so. We'll dress up, it'll be fun. I want to go, but my Dad said no. - It's a real shame. - Yeah. - I gotta go. - Just one thing. I asked you on Facebook to be my brother. So, click on "Accept". OK, I'll see. Bye. You been to clubs? Yes, but in Le Havre. I mean real clubs. There are good clubs there. I mean Parisian clubs. No, but my uncle's a DJ. He knows lots. Know Les Planches? - Planches? - In the 6th. What's more, they let in. You just have to dress up. What're you doing here? - Isn't it Astrid's party? - You're not invited. - What? - You know you're not. You're joking? Yeah, sure, I'm joking... Even you said you weren't invited. - We were joking. - No, we weren't. Well, it's not your party or yours. It's Astrid's party, so I'm asking. What? Can I come in? Hey, you're not invited. Benoit told me to come. Hi. - Did you invite him? - No. Weren't you looking after your kid brother? I sorted it out with my Dad. Yeah, sure! You didn't want to come with me. Why do you say that? I'm gonna get a drink. See you later? You OK? You're Astrid's sister? How old are you? 12. Don't you think it smells synthetic? What's your problem? What are you laughing at? Are you stupid? What was that for? Look at her. What were you thinking of? - It was a joke. - No-one's laughing. She's crying. Happy now? It took hours to bake. - No sense of humor. - Say sorry. You weren't even invited. Get out of my home. I mean it. My Mom's not coming till 11. - Wait outside. - I can't. Yes, you can. Get out! Go on, it won't kill you. - Out. - Don't touch me. She wants you to leave. - Don't touch me. - Out. Just get out. Why? You cause a scene, you weren't invited. I'm cool, I let you in. Wait for your mother outside. He didn't mean any harm. His joke went down badly. So what? He can get out. His Mom'll be here soon. He can't wait in the street. Screw this. Now cut the crap, OK? I had pepper-spray on me, 'cause in that neighborhood, you get your stuff stolen... ...so, I pepper-sprayed 'em. I meant no harm. It was just for fun. Yeah, I know. It's them. They've got no sense of humor. Here, boy. What the...? What's he doing? OK, OK... - Put your head in. - No, gross. Go on. Oh, shit! It's a cheap one. Your hair's sticking up at the top! You've got big-headed! Pee, pee... I love it! Drink it, drink it! You know, in life, there are good guys and bad guys. Get out! Calm down, girls. I won't calm down. Look at your mess! What mess? Look at the state of the kitchen. Hey, no-one's dead! Why put a condom on a dog? Get lost. I'm drunk. It's alcohol-free beer! - Get out, you jerk. - No! You're busting my balls. Absent friends! - Get out. - No! Get out! - Stop it! - Get out! I decide when I go. So, now I'm going. - Finally. - You're so immature. Not even a clown at your party! Get out. We won't outstay our welcome. No, enough! Enough! Unbelievable! Why did I let him in? Think that's funny? Get out. - Hello. Johanna? - Yes. Who is it? I can't say, but I'm with a boy who loves you. He wants to know if you love someone in your school. What? I'll say it again. I'm with a boy. He wants to know if you love someone in your school. You friend of Charles? It's not Charles. Why ask? I won't tell you who. Gabriel? Don't insist. I can't tell you. Just answer the question. Benoit? What now? Say it's Charles. - You're busted. - Say it's Charles. Hang on, Johanna. She knows it's you. You're busted. She knows it's you. You idiot! Give me the phone. This is Benoit. Yes? I wanted to tell you something. Remember when we were at the cinema? I brought another girl to make you jealous. I never told you, 'cause I was scared to tell you. Well, I really dig you. "Dig"? What does "dig" mean? It means I like you. You my girlfriend? Well, I know we're friends, but actually, I... I'm in love with you. I love you. Benoit, you... you my girlfriend. You not my love. What? I don't want to be in love. Well, I gotta hang up now. Sorry, Benoit. Bye. Why did you tell her about the jealousy thing? You shouldn't have said. You're busted now. Shouldn't have said. You asleep? No. You know... Your Swedish girl isn't even a real blond. Maybe she lied and she isn't even Swedish. Thanks, buddy. You're welcome, buddy. Sorry, you can't join. You always sing too low or too high. OK, let's get ready. Someone's got a stinky ass!
