Cassidy, will you stop playing, please? You've touched it for a year and you can not get better. Sorry folks. I'll play softer now. Let me know if you mind, okay? Parker, Inspector. Parker, Mr. Governor. Robert Leroy Parker vulgar Butch Cassidy. "How did you get the name Butch?" - I worked at a butcher shop. - You want parole? "Yes, yes, sir." The only time he was arrested. For stealing horses. Despite being suspected of 3 round robberies - Wait... - Six? - 12 is more fitting. - Sheriff Bledsoe. You already know each other. - Yes sir. It was he who arrested me. - Hello, Ray. - Hello, Butch. "Were not you working in Utah?" - I still am. The sheriff came here to speak well of you when he heard about the conditional. He said he released you from jail for a few hours... ... on the eve of sending you here. That's right? Yes sir. "He was not afraid that he take advantage to escape? - No? "Why not?" Because I promised I would not run away. Promise me you'll stay on the side of the law, and I'll give you the parole now. "I do not think I can do that, sir." "Why not?" Why it would not be true. Ray, you know I tried to walk the line, but I could not. "If you want to be loose you need to cooperate." - I, I know, I know, but... But it would be a lie, sir, sir. I'll tell you what I can do. - I make a deal. "Butch, he's the Governor. I promise, that if I ever let go of the law in this state. That's what you want, is not it? IT IS... I swear I forget the state! Even if a train with money passes through Wyoming, I do not abide by it. Would I bump into it, Ray? - I tend to believe him. - You see? - I... = Word of Honor - I mean... - Come on. Ahh, my God! Boy, there's an ice! - HÃº, how much is this? - $ 25. I'll take this one. And a handful of bullets. No, I'll take about a dozen. Liked it. - Hi. - Hi how are you? - How about a photo? - That's what I want. Great. I have good things. I have the best collection you've ever seen. Can believe. That's exciting. Come on, look at this. On here. Will impress you - Yeah, that one. "That will be three dollars. - I only have two. "No, three. That's the price. "I only have two," I said. - Three. "I said two bucks for hell. "Good for you, it costs two dollars." Stay still. Come on, I want to show you something. Good evening. Good evening. I want a Guinness. - I was asking myself, What's up there? - Bedrooms. If you want to show your curiosity, give her $ 20. She shows you one. I'm not that curious. Now it's up to you. What do you say? I have a revolver under the table. Do not do anything stupid. Let's pretend we're just playing cards. Right. What am I going to do... It's for a hundred dollars at the table. You will see me and put another hundred dollars. Let's continue playing until all money is on the table It's ok? Right. Come on. $ 100... and I'm going to put another $ 100. I think I'm going for another $ 5oo, and we're done with it. "I think you're bluffing." - Let's see if I am. I have a pair of three, and five bullets pointed at your belly. Tone! Damn it! - Hey! This weapon is new! - Great, then it should work! Get the sheriff! - Something wrong, sir. Le Fors? "He did not cross here." "Are not the traces of him you were following?" "Yes, they did, but he did not cross here. No traces on the other side He passed this channel How do you know that? See these shiny stones? His horse kicked them. There is mud on top of the others. - He's up there. - Why do you think that? It took him a whole night and a ride to get here. "And such a place gives a great position." - Against us. We are in greater numbers. We can lose some men. Let's get him! He did not do something so bad that we need to arrest him Are you afraid to climb? He did some damage to my Saloon but many of them open it from time to time I tracked it down to 10 days and now I got it. "But I can not go up and get him by myself." "No, that would be suicide. - Depend on us. - We? Anyone want this? Let's go. It seems they do not want you as much as I do! But I'll see you again! Try to remember my face. The name is Le Fors! Hey! Listen if you're there. I'm the guy you stole the gun from yesterday! I had to buy another one. That cost me $ 12. I want to talk to you! Listen. I'll get this new gun... and put here on this stone. Did you see? - I'm here because I want to do you a favor! - I'm making you one now. - As? - Not by squeezing the trigger. Right. I think you will not, fordi... You have no reason to fear me! You also noticed that. I am also outlaw. That's why I followed you. But I suck at tracking so I followed the group. And here I am. You have to admit it's very clever. Or very stupid. - What the hell! If you kill me you will not listen to me. I bet this gets better hot. Mit navn er Butch Cassidy. You must have heard of me. - Maybe not. Do you have a name? Yes. "Boy, you shoot well. "Is that the favor you said?" I'll get there. The way you escaped yesterday was something very special. But I would not be there if I was not so dumb You need to admire my sincerity. I do not have to do anything. Trying to steal a game in a crowded casino is stupid. Okay, all right. Maybe not stupid. Maybe it's the wrong word. But who can handle a revolver like this... I should not be sitting here eating cold cereal in the middle of nowhere. Here's the favor I'm going to do to you: I'm going to teach him to steal a casino... "You're good at what you do, and so am I. "What are you good at?" In thinking .. Plan. Stuff like that. I'm as good with my mind as you are with the gun. - I work alone. "I saw that you're very successful at it. Let me tell you something. I could kill him here. So do not say I'm stupid. I'm as smart as you, understand? With that in your hand, you're a genius. How do I get out of here? - Hello, Butch. - Good morning, Harvey. - I was looking for you. - IT IS? - The train passed some weeks full of money I did not find you to help me steal it. - I was in jail for a year. "I guess that's why I did not teache you." It must have been. There is nothing much. The Lazy Eleven cows are now Circle Z. Okay, guys, let's see you try. Leave the. That black over there. Hello, O.C. Hello, O.C. Hello, O.C. Hello, what have you been doing? "I'm glad to see you!" "Nice to see you, too." You will not believe what's going on here now. Supposedly outlaws, and cattle thieves too. They are not. Just boys in the majority. But what bad luck. I thought the judge had given you two years. You left early, did not you? - I made a deal .. "What kind of deal?" Just an agreement. Hey Butch, wait a second. Listen, over your hut... Emma and I used your house while you were away. - I hope you do not mind. - No, O.C. Nice to see a feminine touch in place. She did not find the broom this morning. Butch, let her take care of it. She'll be here soon. Go make us some dinner. Is she cooking, too? You're a lucky man, O.C. What is this? We have our own saloon now. Very good. O.C., the next time you steal something, it better be women. Hey you, the music. Stop! This is my friend, Butch Cassidy. Straight from Wyoming to Laramie. Butch and I are going to leave you idiots in shape. Let's get things organized here. Who does not follow, will be fired... I'll tell you something else .. Friends? A joke! Right, we surround the whole place. Get out without your guns! And with your hands up! It's a hunt group. They surrounded us. What are we going to do? Think of something. We surrender. - Come on. Outside you. - Come on. We have a long way to go. No, not him. Hi, Butch Wait!. Why do not you arrest him? He was in prison when Lazy Pupan's cows were stolen. How do you know? "I was there when he was released. What kind of deal did you make, Butch? What? To get out of prison? It is? Did you bring them here? I... Do not be so silly, O.C. I'll kill you, Butch. I'd try to avoid him when he leaves. Congratulations on a long life. You were released a week ago and have already returned to Brown's Hole. Get yourself a job or something. Stay out of trouble. I do not want a job, Ray. This life is not for me. What about your promise to the governor? It was in Wyoming. "And that does not apply in Utah?" - No. Have the decency to think of me I do not want to arrest him again! It would be very embarrassing. Right, Ray, same deal. I'm out of your jurisdiction. "How many places can you promise to get away from?" - It's a big country. Perhaps. But there is more law than ever. Not old fools like me waiting for the pension and hoping not to be killed. Young people, full of moral passion! You will not make deals with them. My God. What are you doing out there? - Cool place you have here. - Yes We, outlaws, live well. What you want? - I thought about what you said - About what? About you and me to unite. Oh? I heard you work alone. Not long ago, you wanted to join me, am I wrong? Now I'm not so sure anymore. You are very temperamental. On the other hand, you also have good qualities. It's ok. What's your name really? Longabaugh. Harry Longabaugh. It is not an outlaw's name. You also have no outlaw face. It's better to do something about it. - IT IS! As? - I do not know. Get a scar, leave a mustache, I do not know. - I'm leaving a mustache. - At where? Right here. See? "How long have you been the cuktiva?" - Not long ago. - How much time? "Not too long. It just grows slowly at first. "Should we steal anything or not?" - Yeah, we should steal something. "How about a train?" Let's steal a train. - A train? You do not go out robbing trains. This requires practice. We have to work together for a while. To progress - Casino - All right. That casino where you failed last week. "I can not go in there." They would recognize it. - Yes you can. Oh, God, no. I listened. Stand still 'cause I'll fix it. What are you doing out here for nothing? Do you think it's funny? Do not. No one notices a tramp. Is not that what you said? Come on, let's get out of here. Is playing Did you see the money in that safe? I'm not going there. It's not so bad. You get used to the smell. - Do you get it? - Yes. Come now. You do not want? "You said it was not so bad." - I lied. I took all the steps .. You will love. Have we met before, have you? You're no stranger to me. I have a common face. "Everything in me is kind of average. - It is a pity. - Where are you from? - Canada. You look Canadian. This is ours. Dear What is that room? The red room. But you can not enter with $ 20 only. Forget the expenses. The red room looks good. Ruby, use this one. The spendthere here wants the red room. - Let's share it with you! - Share? My name is Butch Cassidy. This is Harry the possum. "I've heard of you." "Why do you want to share us?" You look good people and I do not want to kill you. But he would kill. Look at him. He's an animal! "What do you get?" About $ 20 a week? - Yeah, I get $ 22. If we divide we will be rich for the next 10 years. And no one will suspect you. They'll think I did it. "Because I'm Butch Cassidy outlaw. "And he's Harry Opossum." "Now open the safe!" "Open up, Eliah. I'm going to have to knock you out so you will not be suspicious. - Knock off? - Not to look like we're involved, idiot "Where do we leave the part of you?" - Are you going south? One kilometer from the town there is a fork leading to Steamboat Springs. Follow for 3 km until the shortcut of Yampe. There are two large marshes there. has a large cavity... ...on the right. climb halfway How about under the mattress down the hall? It is also a good place. I'm next. Butch, I've never hit a woman before. So do not hit her. Let's take it. It might be nice to have a woman on the rails with us. You may even fall in love and marry her. - It was great! What are we going to do now? "Do not get too comfortable." Hey, where the hell are you going? "Well, Butch. - Excuse me. Okay. Go get your teeth. Next. "I do not want to cut my hair." - Sit down, come on. Come on, I have not got all day. Stopped! Or cut your nose! Now slowly. Very slowly when getting up. - Now, call the guard. Call him. - Guard! Go there! Go! Who would say! Have you been to Telluride before? "No, I do not think so. You would remember if you had been. Great place. Many outlaws lurk there in the winter. Great hotelsnn elegant restaurants "Do you think we're wanted?" - Perhaps. Because? I do not know. I've never been through this before. That makes you important. Well, if you want your name on a wanted poster, it's better to be something better than Harry Longabaug... Minh mother liked. No, it's not possible, Harry. "I used Harry Alonzo for a while. - Alonzo? Because? That's my middle name. Harry Alonzo. I'll keep it a secret - Alonzo - What's wrong with Alonzo? Let me see Harry Cherokee Charlie. Buck Barton. Johnny Ringo. No, he already owns it. Lucky Wilson? Oh, come on. Can you help me. I need inspiration. Have you ever done anything interesting in life? "Well, I was in prison someday. - At where? - In Sundance, Wyoming. Okay. Kid Sundance. Sundance Kid. Yeah, I liked that one. I liked too. Actually I liked it so much, I think I do. You can be Butch Cassidy if you want. Hey, it was me who was stuck there, not you. This is my name. Sundance Kid. There's nothing like it, Sundance. You will love. It's Telluride! Hands up! - Yeah, I already loved it. - For there. That's good. Now give me everything you have. It's in here. - I can help you? - Just stay still. Do not move. I'm standing still. It's you who moves. Is this one of the outlaws that goes around here? Why are you trying to steal innocent people? I need $ 500. - $ 500 dollars? "Or what you can give." - I'll get the rest of the next one. - The next popde to kill you. "Why do you need all this?" "We have a little farm out of town. "You and your wife?" - Me and my mother. Had a bad year. The plantations did not avenge, the cattle died. We can not pay the bank, and they will come in the morning to receive. "You forgot the hungry dog." Shut up, Sundance. What are you doing? "Shall I give him the $ 500 dollars?" - All? That's it. Do not forget to tell everyone that you know me... That Butch Cassidy gave you this. Butch Cassidy? - You do not know who i am? "No, I'm sorry, sir. Well, I am a well known outlaw. Maybe not so much here but in Utah, Wyoming... "I think I heard about you, Mr. - Cassidy. Yes, that's right, that's right! Dutch Cassidy. I do not know about you, but I'm freezing. Those $ 500 will buy us a lot of good will here. Did you see the way that old man looked at me? Like I'm some hero. Is that what you want to be? A hero? Did not you ever want to be a hero? Have children admiring you? When I was a child, my hero was an outlaw. Mike Cassidy. I even got his name. He was the best, Sundance. "I could beat him." - what? "You've never seen him." - I can beat him. You think it's so good, huh? I suppose Dr Holliday's battery too? - I'll pop his head wherever he is. "Be." He is dead. You did not say he was good. 300... 400... 450... - Hi. - What? It's dangerous to be here alone. Mostly with money. We will accompany you so that no one appears pull a gun and shoot his belly. He would steal it and bleed it in the snow. Oh! Thank you Good luck! See, Sundance, we've recovered our $ 500... and the old man has his farm... and we bought a lot of good will. And it did not cost us anything. That old man is going to tell everyone how Butch Cassidy is a nice guy. Do not you mean Dutch Cassidy? Let's go "Can I get you another drink, sir?" Cassidy? "No thanks, Jack. Here it is. "What are the five dollars for, sir?" - what? "The five dollars... what are they for?" - Do not know. - Stay with them. - Thank you. I never thought I'd tire of fun after two weeks. I need action. Lily? - Not again I have to do something to keep me from boredom. I could now. Let's go I bring a message from Hoffman Mine. He says they die like diphtheria flies. "Why me?" - I'll tell him. He's the doctor. We have a load of serum in the Mail. But it's snowy. No one get there It seems that you are not getting to him either. I'm looking for volunteers but I do not think anyone is willing. Good morning Miss Daisy. "Butch, I saw an old friend of yours today. - Saw? - I was in the store and saw O.C .. - Hanks? How many do you know? "I said you were always here." - Said? "He's eager to see you." Still need someone to take the serum? - Need. - We'll take it. I and he. Come on Buck. Give me one good reason to be doing this. - Only one. Because it's perfect. "Not Butch, that's certainly not perfect. "We could have gone to the south where there are roads. "Hanks could do that, too. The good thing about this is that he will never think of following us here. That's because he's smart. You're staring the wrong way. We were bored, were not we? This is an adventure. How far is it from this place that we're going? 40 km. A 40km trip on this? Just one way. It's just a way. It does not have to follow by 40Km in this. Let's get it easily. As? I do not know. "What do you call it?" Delight in the snow. "You go through the snow like that?" - Yes. "Do you have more of these things?" - Yeah, in my cabin. I do not know, it seemed a lot easier when you did it. - I've been doing this my whole life. You will learn quickly. - Yes Everyone does this, until they get used to the skis. - You need to bend your knees. - The knees. Hey, there are no mysteries. - There are some tricks. - Yeah, like what? How to stop Sundance, are you okay? No more rest. Let's continue. I can not. Are your legs cramping? They died two hours ago. I'm freezing. Freezing? You're sweating. "Let me take a look at you." - I have a throbbing headache. - I bet you got it. - What? - Diphtheria. - Oh no! Certainly from one of the girls in Telluride. It's the 1st. they pass on diphtheria to someone. Let's go. I'll help you get up I will not be able to. Continue Sundance. Save yourself There is no reason for us both to die. You'd love that, would not you? Then you would be a real hero. Dead heroes are the best. Shut up. They could build a great monument here. "Here jazz Butch Cassidy, outlaw and hero, who died by taking serum... for sick children and dogs. " - Shut up, Sundance! To hell with that! You will not be a hero to the at my expense, Butch. - Come on, get up now! - I can not. Yes you can. Yes you can, you know why? Because we have the damn serum here in our luggage. We got the serum right here. On here. Get up Drink this. "You do not drink the whey, you donkey!" "What is to be done with him?" I saw a doctor do this once. He used a glass tube with a needle. He snapped at the guy's arm. My God. Wait a second. Here it is. You should for the serum in the glass tube. - As? - I do not know. Here it is. - Wait a minute. "You almost did it. Please try again. Oh shit! You had to get sick! You had to bring me here and get sick! - I should leave it here! "That's what I've been up to!" Just... go to hell! What... what is this? Did you hear something? Hello there! We brought the serum! We came from Telluride with the serum! Why did not you come sooner? - Amtes? - We've been asking for help a week ago! Son of a bitch! I'm with a man here who's dying! - She died here. Who died? My wife. Their mother. Well, Butch. Then you finally got your parade. Sundance, next time which I mention "hero", Shoot me. You know what. We should steal a train now, right? I'll be patient. Be patient A train requires a lot of planning. Let's get out of here. You need to know schedules. Changing routes, things like that. "And you need at least four men." "Four men?" Yes. Mike Cassidy and I stole the Denver Rio Grande in 1987. We stopped him with ease. We opened the freight car in the blink of an eye. But..., we put dinemite on top of the safe, and we lit up. We had no experience. We were very dumb. We exploded the safe on the floor of the car. He was trapped between the rails. We did not pick up or move the train. It was horrible. We tried everything. "Did you just leave it there?" We leave Maybe it's still there, as far as I know. Listen, we should... - What's it? - Nothing. Act naturally, but go behind a tree. That was for giving me, you pig! Are you you I did not deliver! It's insane. My own men shoot me. - Sundance? - What is? What happened? They did not hit you, and they made a hole in me. - Let me see. - Is nothing. I had never been hurt in the shootings I was in. You will be fine. There's a good doctor in Circleville about 50 miles from here. You can? Yes, no problem. Let's get out of here. - I just have to stop a little. - It's ok. I need to get down. Pond or bleeding. "No, it's not like that. - So how is it Take a cartridge and open it. There's a tool in my bag. - Pour into the wound. - Are you sure? Do it. - Now it lights up. - What? - Take a match and light it. - No. "Then give me a match and I'll do it." - No. Butch, that's the only way to stop the bleeding. Come now. This is going to hurt a lot and it can kill you. It hurts a lot. If it does not, it's going to go out, damn it. You look so much better. You need to wash. What's your name? Mary. - Where we are? - About 1.5 miles from Circleville. You should not talk too much. I'll tell him you're awake. Tell him in an hour. The doctor said that you will have a full recovery. How long have I been unconscious? For a long time. Hi, look. We thought it would be a good gift when he woke up. Mary shaved it. It got much better as well. Hey, Butch. - As for Mary... - Yeah, what about her? If you still can not think it can not give. Well, it's best not to .. In your state and everything. Besides, she's my wife. - What they want? "Are you really Sundance Kid?" - Who are you? "Robert Leroy Parker Junior, sir. I'm Sam. Samuel Maximilian Parker, sir. I told you to get away from here. Okay, I was sleeping a lot. "Your mother says you have homework. "I barely have it." She's very strict, Dad. Moms are like that. Take care of them. "You can not trust women." - Come on "Do you know Butch Cassidy?" - He's an outlaw here. "Yes, I know old Butch. - What's he like? He's short. A little little guy. With small, burning eyes. It looks like a mole. - Mai ugly the devil. - Let's go guys. Sundance does not feel very well. You can see that he is dekirando. Let's go. Good evening, Sundance. - You bastard! - They do not know? That's how she wants it. And I agree too. "When was the last time you saw them?" "The day before I was arrested. Do not they think it strange that you stay out so long? This is how it always was. They think it's normal. - I'm sending money. "Sooner or later they'll find out." I've been thinking about it. - Good night Good Night. "I want a dozen pork ribs." - Yes ma'am. - It's a lot of Parker paper. This is expensive. - Yes sir. "Give me 2 pounds of steak." "I'll see you in a minute, ma'am." And take off the fat. I do not pay for it. - Closer. - Right. "What are you doing, Parker?" - She asked me to take the fat off. If she does not like it from somewhere else. "There is no other place. - Aha! And stop bleeding the meat. Very slow. "Now it's my turn to be Sundance. "You're still Cassidy. I do not want to be Cassidy! He's an ugly dwarf! So you're an ugly dwarf. Mom, Bobby does not let it be Sundance. Bobby, let Sam be Sundance for a while. Be it Cassidy. "I do not want to be Cassidy. - Great. My own children. "Cassidy does not do anything good. - You heard? Cassidy does not do anything right. And then I said: Butch... if you put the dynamite on top of the safe it will not open. But Butch is stubborn as a mule and a lot uglier. I do not know how you handle it. And yet he put the dynamite on top of the safe... he lit and there was a huge explosion. When the smoke had dissipated the safe had crossed the wagon - and was caught in the railroad tracks. "What did you do then, Sundance?" "Yes, what did you do?" Being smarter than Butch. How did you get the money out of the safe? Thank you, Mary. - What I did not tell you is that we stopped the train on top of a bridge. - A bridge? Did you stop the train on a bridge to steal it? It's a perfect place, Robert. Even with the safe stuck in the rails,... was hanging on the bridge, so I just needed Butch to hold my feet... I hung up and took all the money out of the safe. It was incredible that he had not let go of his head. Boys, why do not you get the Curley from the cream separator. Why do you speak ill of me in front of my children. I speak ill of you What are you trying to do to me? I'm just telling stories. Do not say that what happened to me was with you. They think Butch Cassidy is some idiot. Maybe he is. Excuse me, Mary. Is very good. - What's the matter with you? - I do not know. Yes I know. Today I heard in the city that Mike Cassidy is stuck in Wyoming. Rob! Are not you going to try anything like take Mike out of jail or something? Do not. Mary, you know... Let his arrest, make you understand that what you do now is right. "Be glad you're not there." - Yes I stay. I know the last few weeks have been difficult. I'll be fine. As soon as Sundance has the strength to get out of here. This water rose another 5 cm. Hurry up Parker, we have to open. - Good morning, ladies. - Good Morning. It's late afternoon. Four minutes late. Where are you going, huh? - I have to leave for a while. - because? Because someone who wants to kill me is in town. "Does he know you're here?" "Not yet, but you'll know. If I leave now he will not hurt you And after he's gone? I'll stay hidden for a while. let things calm down and then I'll come back. "It's going to start all over again, right?" - No! No you will not. And why are you taking this? Because you do not leave without it. Where are the boys. I want to say goodbye to them. They're with Sundance in the creek. I'll be back. I promise you that. Mary, I could not stop O.C. from coming. I know that. It's not your fault. It's just how things are. The one you are. Something always happens. - Bye, Robert. - Mary? - How are you doing? - Do you want to try? I'd like to, Sam, but I can not. "I have to stay away for a while. - because? - Something happened. "Not that you go." I do not even want a son anymore, I have to go. So is Sundance going? Yes, Sam. I think so too. Bobby, give your father a hug. Hey, try not to fight too much in my absence, right? I kept it for your birthday, but You have to take care of it for me. Do you want to hold it for a moment? Listen well here, okay? You know how I say that Butch Cassidy, is he an ugly bass? Well, that's not true. He's a really nice guy... and a little smarter than I said. Not the worst guy I've ever met. I want you to remember that, right? What was that? Anything. Why do not you bother this guy? If I kill him, I'll go back to the starting point. And he shoots better shoot than I would probably kill me. "But then your troubles are over, right?" - Great. Who is this guy? - I do not think I heard him. - What did you say? - Hanks. What did you shoot me? Yeah, listen to Sunsance. He did not look at you, shoot me "Then it's all right." - Oh, he almost killed me. - Sundance! You're not 100 percent yet. - If you falter you can lose an arm or a leg .. "I will not hesitate. "How can you be sure?" - I've been practicing. Throwing in bottles? They do not shoot back. "Just tell him I'm here." - No. "Then I'll go there." - OK Alright. Where are you going? "Listen to O.C., I do not want any problems. - What did you say? That I want no problem. Is this your new system? Infiltrate people from behind? I'm trying to save your life. Cutting my throat? I've never killed anyone and I do not want to start now. "But there is someone out there who would kill you." Who? Sundance Kid. "I have no quarrel with anyone by that name. "Yeah, you do not?" When you tried to kill me at Ogden Orchard, you hit him and not me. And he's not the forgiving type. So if I was you, I would go out the back door and go. You're bluffing. There is no one out there. There are sim, O.C. Believe me, he's the best I've ever seen. Better than Doc Holliday. O. C. Hanks! Come on, you cowardly pig! Go O.C., disappear from here, while I distract him. He wants to fight, Butch O.C. Hanks does not pull anyone's nose. When I finish him, Butch... it's your turn I heard you have a complaint. I do not like people to make holes in my body. I can understand that. How long does About a month, maybe I wonder if you've recovered. I think not. Am I right? - I'll get the sheriff. - Call... but later. But we'll find out, will not we? It hurts, does not it? Tell me Sundance, do you like water? Want more? I bet you're a little slow, are not you? - Come on, O.C., or I'll shoot you! - I'm ready. "Get your revolver, kid. - You first. It's 17 o'clock Get out on the fifth ring! He pulled it out before! Got it before! He is dead. You shot the heart. I never knew how to count, the bastard. He did not even hear it. "I did not want to kill you..." - I know that. I just wanted to put a hole in it. - I had to shoot very fast. - I know that. I've never killed anyone before. I shook them, but I never killed them... Are you sure he's dead? "Who was this guy?" - Who? Hanks. - It was cool. - Thank you very much. - Whereby? You should say he was a pig that deserved to die. "Does he have any family?" "Only five children. - Had she? - No! Stop torturing yourself. He had no family. Just an old witch with whom he lived. If you're going to get into shootings, you can not choose just orphans for that. You have a visitor, Cassidy. - I do not know anybody. Go away. - Your lawyers. When you want to leave, shout. Lawyers? They're in the wrong room. It's me. Butch. - Butch? - Cassidy. You became somebody boy. You are now a lawyer. No, I'm not a lawyer. Are not you a lawyer? What are you doing here? We came to get you out of here. I do not want to go out. There are other methods. We're going to give you a real lawyer. The best of Wyoming. Cyrus Antoon, if necessary. Do you know how much it costs? - How much? "I do not know, but lots of money. We took the money in the bank. - Which bank? - Anyone we choose. Damn it! She shifted. - Where is the bank? - Over there. We have a deposit to make. Right. Just hand over your weapons first. We have to protect this until you're in the safe. It's the that our boss said And we have to get the guns, That's what our boss said. Damn, I have to see this. I'll be right back. What should we do? Strangle everyone. Excuse me. I did not see you. Here, boy, get 5 cents. Buy a new bag of popcorn. - It costs 10 cents. - What? Then get 20 cents. Buy two bags of popcorn. Sorry lady. Sundance, the door Come on. Thank you very much. Hands up, everyone. Keep Calm We'll be leaving in a few minutes. Keep everyone in sight. - What are you doing? - This is enough. How so, enough. For Antoons Fees. When will we have another chance like this? That's all we need. I'm trying to straighten up. - You call that straightening up? "Stealing just a little." This is enough. I'm saying! Sundance. Look that. Little children working for the damn railroad. - Hey, Butch! - Harvey! - I got your message. Carver and I worked on this train to see what we found. Apparently there is a train full of money that will leave in a few days of Frisco. - Who is he? - Oh sorry. This is Harvey Logan known as Kid Curry, Bill Carver, Harvey and Sundance Kid. You have not heard the best yet. It's a mint train! There's a cash press in Frisco. Every once in a while they take a load of money they printed... and carry it. On this train. "He leaves the day after tomorrow for Salt Lake. "No, I think I'll quit." All right, excuse me. We do not need you. I'm with you. "And who should plan the robbery?" - I. - You think you're the only one around here What do you think? - This way, yeah. And we can only steal a train if you show us how? - Right - So show us that. Why the hell! "Lords of the Jury, have you reached a verdict?" "We have arrived, Your Excellency. We awarded the defendant Mike Cassidy innocent. Court dismissed. Next case in 10 minutes. It is the best country in the world. Ray, Ray, how's it going? Are not we going in the saloon to get us drunk a little? "You will not get drunk, Mike. Not as long as you do not. - What? I have a hunch that Butch Cassidy... stole the bank in Montpelier to pay mr. Antoon. God bless you. I think you owe him something. The Governors of three states accepted... that if the Butch come back willingly... at the same time, they renounce all charges against him. It would be great Ray. The hard part is finding it. You can do it. Listen here. People tell you things, they do not tell me. Talk to him and fast. If he commits an assault, the agreement is undone. Now, get out of here. I do not have to agree to this Bledsoe plan. It's only to follow that fret that he takes us to Cassidy, and then we get him and the Kid. - I've been thinking... - It may be dangerous. What do we do with Logan and Carver? Why do not we do it at work alone? Two men just can not steal a train. Requires at least four. "And they must be on the train by now." - You believe? The damn train does not stop! He passes straight through! Nobody on board! There is no way to make the driver stop. "And the train has a detachment of cavalry." - Cavalry? A wagon full of them. The horses go in the front wagon. - That ruins everything. - Not necessarily. That train will not stop for horse guys next to the rails. You're right. We have to get rid of the horses. And after stealing the train? Are we going to run? "And how are we going to make the damn train stop?" "Why does the train stop?" "Has anyone seen Butch Cassidy?" He started off in that direction. Along with Logan and Carver. Thank you guys. This is the last time I steal a train with you, Butch. - Did you hear that? - It's about time. My legs are numb. "I feel like urinating." - I just did that. "I'm looking for Butch Cassidy. "I think he went that way." "Where's Butch Cassidy?" - I do not know him. Listen, sir, if I did, I would not tell you. Even if he killed me. The mint train. You two are thinking better, no? For starters, I thought of that, right? I just wanted to be sure. "There seem to be many." - I know. We can not deal with so many. They will not need to act right. Very well. Are you ready? So it is now. Jump, you miserable .. I can only count on you. Do you think we can do that? - Do not know. - I think we'll find out, uh. I'll get the driver and the stoker. Stay between the cattle car and the Cavalry. It's ok. Good luck. - Continues. - That's what I thought I would do. You chose the wrong train to steal, my friend. There is a whole contingent of cavalry on board. Not for long. - Butch, we got problems. - What is? Harvey said the horses were ahead of the soldiers. It's the opposite. - Damn it! "They're behind them. "That changes the plans a little." - I guess so. - Stop the train - You want to get off? What do you think if I blow your brains out? "You can keep the cavalry." in that wagon for a while? - No problem. Vilte, and make it seem like there are more people than you. "How many do you want me to have?" "I do not know, a whole brigade." Give me your revolver. Well, you're lucky not to use it. The cartridges are wet. Give me a few minutes to get in and settle, right? Right. Stop! You have wet cartridges. Wet cartridges do not fire. Want to test this theory? I've never felt so safe on board a train. With all of you soldiers on board. We will do our best to get you safely. - Why are we stopping? "I do not know. I do not see anything." Is that water? Give me that. Hello! This is a robbery. Open the door please. Do as I say and open the door. I can see one of them. - What is it? - Kerosene. What do you want with kerosene? Well, I have a match in my hand. Are you going to try to guess? - How many up there? - Do not know "How many are there?" - $ 25 thousand; Let's take two, please. There is much more there. - I just take clean two. - I can help you with that. Why are you so helpful? This is funny. You know how annoying it is to get on this wagon every day. I can imagine that. All right, come on. Climb up and enter you. They're stealing the post office car, right? Yes. Are there any wounded? - No. Will you do nothing to stop them? Not yet. I do not want to rush you. They can hurt some civilians, sir. - Let's wait... - But Captain! This is the American cavalry! When they try to escape, will we come upon them like a hawk? Let's go back! I hope they do not create courage. I only have five more bullets. "I'm not really sure. - Let's go now. We have them now. They are coming in. Get out of the way! Let's see if we can knock them down. "If you do not mind, you'd better not try that." - Play then. Excuse me. Thank you very much. - That's heavy. "Then try to run with it." Shit! No more bullets! Sundance, I can not open the door. - Your suspenders! - What? Give me your braces. I had an idea. - It's stuck. "Let's get all the ammo." Where's the machine gun? I do not know. Come on, Sundance! Men are right, horses! Let's get them! At where...? Where are the horses? "Are you in charge?" - Yes. "We need horses that are rested." "Take whatever you want." They're right there. We got it! You shot some pretty good shots, you know that? They are only sldados. I stare at them anytime. IT IS? Some day, sooner or later someone will get us. In that case Butch, I vote in the "afternoon." I said you would have the poster you wanted. Motherfucker! We're going to get famous!
