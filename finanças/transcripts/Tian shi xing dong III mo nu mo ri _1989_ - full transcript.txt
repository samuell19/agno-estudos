- All soldiers, on your mark, present arms. - Welcome. - Mr. Huan, welcome to Thailand. My assistant, Lieutenant Chu. - Nice to meet you. - And this is Chief Inspector Mr. Chang. - Hello. - Hello Mr. Huan. - And this is... - Huh? Hey, what are you doing? Let me go! Let me go! - Hold your fire! - Mr. President, our first project in Thailand was successful. The Vietnam attache was punished and killed. But I'm afraid to say that our soldiers... - Well done. Well done. Well done. Very well done. That is excellent! - Good morning. - Good morning. How can I help you? Mr. Phong, nice to see you, welcome. - How are you? - Mr. Harrison is expecting your arrival, he's waiting in the conference room. - Thank you. - Oh, excuse me, Mr. Phong. For security purposes, please put on this identity card before you enter and return it to me when you leave. - Okay, thanks. - The conference room is at the right. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Excuse me. Is Mr. Harrison in? - Yes, please go inside. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Hi, I'm Dick Harrison. Chief of Asian Affairs. You must be Alex Phong. - Yeah. - You're angel number 12, right? - Mhmm. - Huh. This is Mark. - Hi, how are you? - Hi, good to see you. - Everybody here calls him Computer. - Computer? - Please come in. - Thank you. - You want a drink? - Yeah, thanks. - What kinda drink would you like? - Some wine? - You got it. - Thanks. - Let's talk over there. Now, the reason that I called you here is we have a difficult case and we want your help. Computer, tell him. - Thanks. Well Alex, for the past few years in Southeast Asia, the rapid economic growth in Thailand has been a great success. - Yes, I know that. - As a result, some nations among the third world are jealous of all their financial achievement. To stop the expansion of the Thai economy, they've begun to apply terrorism. Last Monday, a Vietnam attache was killed at Bangkok Airport. The assassin handcuffed him and blew up the dynamite he hid in his clothes. - That's horrible. - Yes. And I know that they'll do anything in order to reach their goal, and now they want to break the new relationship between Thailand and Vietnam, who had been enemies for a long time. - According to the information, these terrorists are now planning their operation and they've already hired two assassins, one from Japan and the other from the states. We already know who the assassin from Japan is supposed to be. But we've tried everything to identify the one from the states and failed. - I've already sent most of my men to Thailand. But now, Alex, it'll be much better with your help. I appreciate it. - Oh, wait a minute. My boss sent me here supposedly just for a meeting. I'm not allowed to accept any kind of a job. - Are you sure? Didn't your boss tell you? You and Mark are off to Thailand. - Are you okay? So sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me. Please, wait for me! Oh, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. - That's okay. - This way, please. Here you are, the one on the left. - Thank you. - Right one? Hey, you again. What a coincidence, huh? Hot day. What are you staring at, jerk? Great, sitting next to a jerk. - Miss, what's the matter? - You know the answer. Aren't you ashamed of what you've done? - What's that? I did nothing wrong. What do you mean? I did nothing to her. I just screamed. - He... He touched my tummy! Help me! - Lady, what's the problem? - Oh, he, he, he... - Lady, what'd he do to you? - He... - Okay, okay. I know. I'm leaving. Do you have any other seats? I wanna get out of here. - Give me your ticket. Come with me. - Stupid bitch. - Come on, here you go. - What a sex maniac. Hey, do you live in Thailand? Are you from Hong Kong? Mmm, this is nice, wanna try? It's famous here. You should try some. Wow, that ring is beautiful. Where'd you buy it? This one's nice too. Where'd you get that? Huh? - Do you live in Thailand? - I'm here for vacation. Can I take a look? Oh! Wow, what's the problem? I just want to take a look. This is a bad trip, after that sex maniac, and an overanxious bitch. Why did I come here? Hey! - Yuki? Welcome. Please follow me. Get in. Get out. Come with me. You go inside. Take off all your clothes and throw them to me. - What do you want? - I'm sorry, it's captain's orders. You have to obey. Underwear as well. And take off everything, including the jewelry. Go on. There are some clothes in the upper left-hand corner. Put them on and come with me. What are you staring at? Start the car. - You are Yuki, that right? - Yes. - I want some proof. Now, boy, you stay cool. Well done, well done. So you are really the one. You kill without using a gun. Everybody listen to me. She's a famous killer from Japan called Yuki. She will be my assistant in the future. Whenever I'm not around, she will be in charge of everything. Her order is the same as mine. Understand? - Yes, madam. My cute little baby. There you are, home again. There. To bed. - Hey, come on, why every time I'm one flight ahead of you? I hate waiting at the airport. - That's the rule. Remember, I'm your senior, you're supposed to wait, and that is the way it is. You know that. - Hey, did you come here alone? - Of course not. The entire brigade is here. Mark. - Hi. - This is Mark. Everyone calls him the Computer. - How are you. - Hi. - And a pretty one as well. - Hmm? - Come on. Hi. This is Angel 21, you can call her Karina. - Hello. And this is Mark. - How do you do? - Hi. Your car is over there. - Good. - Who does she think she is? I'm Angel 9, she's only 21. - You're sure that Moon has handled Yuki all right? - Yes. They went away in a tuk-tuk, and I started following them. But when I reached the hut, I found nothing but Moon's clothes and the transmitter. - Wow. What a sexy scene. - What do you think, Mark? - I think that Moon was forced to change and after they were sure everything was safe, they transferred Moon to their base without letting her know the exact place, and I suspect through a container van. What do you think? - Sounds logical. - Hmm. You were there, were ya? - I agree with what Mark assumes. Don't forget he's a computer. Let's go. - It's not cyanide. It's much more deadly. It's an extract from a plant's root, which can only be found in the desert of Africa. - Africa. Ah, San Rafaele. - That's true. I think he's the one who supports all those terrorists. - Karina, let's see the segment of the killing at the airport. - Okay. - Karina, zoom in on that gold tooth. Take a close look at that. The poison is in there. - Wow. That's horrible. They're in the same death squad. - We'll have to inform headquarters right away. - Also, I can request a special unit to monitor all the messages sent out from San Rafaele. Maybe we can get something. - Right. - Tell me the reason why you want to leave this place. - The training here is too hard. - Don't you forget what you agreed. Once you join, the only way out is to die. You want to get out? Now I give you a chance. If you two can win over her, then you may leave. - If we fight her bare-handed, we don't stand a single chance. - You can fight with the knives. Once her blood is seen, that means you have won. But if she wins, you die right here! - Yes. - It's just a practice. I heard that you're good in knives. Why don't we practice it someday? We've already been warned by our government, but thanks for your information. You've been very helpful. - It's our duty. Thank you. - Goodbye. - Bye bye. - The Vietnamese Ambassador really has confidence in you. - After the attache got blown to pieces in the airport, he's afraid he'll be next. - But what if Computer's information is wrong? - He's a CIA man, you should trust what he says. - Well I hope so. But tell me, why did we have to come here to warn the Vietnamese? Will we get any return. - Sure. If the terrorists attack the consulate, and by luck they catch a few of them, and they realize that we've given them the information, logically they would hand them over to us. Am I right about that? What's up there? A highjacking? - I was expecting the gods to agree with you. Huh? - You shit asshole. - Hey, what precautions are they taking? - 40 armed men. - That few? That won't help. - Don't underestimate them. Those men were involved in the war against the Americans. - I bet they were. But they're like sitting ducks waiting for the terrorists to come in here. What if they don't come? Instead if I was a terrorist, I'd wait outside and then shoot the ambassador once he stepped out of this gate. He can't hide in the consulate forever, can he? - Kiwi, a brilliant thought. You don't look that smart. - Hey, our work's over now. How about a Coke? - Hold it. - What's wrong? - There weren't so many stalls when we came in. - Really? Then we better check it out. Two Cokes. - Okay. Huh? Hey, hey hey hey! - Hey. Here you go. - Miss? Miss? I want a pineapple Hey, wait. I want a fresh one. I want a big, big one. - Hey Kiwi. Those are too big for you. I bet you can't pick it up. - Can't you stay out of my business? Miss, what do you think of this? - That one's not fresh. This one's much better. - Kiwi, you should take the one that you just picked. - I'll take this one. Huh? Something's inside. Careful! You bitch. - Huh? - Stop it. Who sent you? Talk now or I'll kill ya. - Okay, I'm on my way there right now. - Excuse me, can you lend me your car? I'll bring it back. - Sit down. Sit properly, whoever sits in this chair must remain upright, understand? Do you know, it's not easy to sit in this chair of mine. It represents power and glory. About the Vietnamese consulate, now everything was spoiled, and yet you don't even know who our enemies are, you bastard. I'm very doubtful about you and your men's working abilities. I think you should die. In this world, fools must die. - If a computer screen can give you the answer, what's the point in us angels coming here? Use your brain. Hey, don't you know Moon's missing now? Probably she's in danger. We gotta do something to help her. Is something wrong with you? It's an advertisement. What's the point in reading that? - Computer, how many boxing gyms are there in Bangkok? - 17. - If a boxer wins a match, how much money can he get normally? - It depends on the weight. Lightweight is about 50,000 baht, and heavyweight can go up to 200,000 baht. - Can you check a gym called Chipan? See how much purse they offer. - A win gets 50,000, but if the opponent dies, an extra two million baht will be rewarded. - When did this kinda game start? - Not too long ago, about three months. - Sounds interesting. - That's not boxing. That's a killing ground. - Let's go. - Where to? - The killing ground. - Hey, hold it, hold it, hold it, break. All right. One, two, three, four. Get back. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. All right, break. - Go on, get him! - Get me a seat in the front. - Get him! Get him! - Come on, get him, get him! - Hey, the red one looks real tough. - You're doing good, just hit him at the waist, you got it? Hit him at the waist. - Hey, you wanna bet? - The uppercut, that's his weak point. - I prefer the blue one. - Okay, I trust you. Hey. - Huh? - Buddy, the blue guy. How much? - One to eight. - What? One to eight? Well, here's 5000. I get 5000 on the blue guy. - The red one looks pretty good. - Yeah, - One two eight? We'll be rich if blue wins. - Go! - Yeah! - It doesn't look good to me. I should never have trusted you. I'll lose 5000. - Hey, why'd you pull him out of the ring? It's against the rules. - The towel's been thrown in the ring, you should stop the match, you wanna kill the guy? - You son of a bitch, I don't care who you are, or where you come from. You stopped me killing him. That's an insult, I challenge you, come on! Come on! You coward! - Don't be afraid. Go on! Crowd, I'm on his side. Those who think Thai can win, I'll accept every bet. Go on, do it. Yeah? Okay? Yeah. - Come up here, shithead. I swear I'll kill you! - Finish him off! - Hey, it's up to you now. Okay. - Now you the know the rules. No hitting beneath the belt, you got that? Understand me? - You're gonna die right here. - Go! Break it up! Break it up. - Come on! - You! - Are you okay? - Yeah. His punch is fast and heavy. - Huh? My burden's heavy too. You can't lose. There's over 40,000 on this bet. You gotta win, Alex. - 2000 on the red! - Yeah, coming, coming. Please, you gotta win, huh? Come on Alex. Huh? - This guy's a bum, hit him long and hard, you can finish him off. - Go on, Alex, knock him down. Go on, do it. - Yeah! - Ready? Now go! Break it up, break it up. Come on. - Come on! Come on! I'm gonna get you! - Sit down. - Hit him low, keep away from him, short sharp blows, keep away from him, hit him low! - Hey, how do you feel? - Not so good. - Huh? You can't lose the fight. It's over 80 grand now. If you lose it, where will we get the money to pay them? - We can't afford to lose it! - Huh? Forget it! Go on, take over, go on. - Yeah. - Go on! - Not too close. - Come on! Here, I can stand your kicks! Come on! - Wait, one, two. Can you go on? Go! Hey, break it up. Come on. - We won! We won! Hey, we won, we won, we won! Hey! Hey, we won! Well done, Alex, great! Great. We did it! Hey, we won! We won! 60, 80, 100. 20, 40, 60, 80, 100. 20, 40, 60, 80, hey, we won more than 80,000! Now, since we're old partners, I'll make this a fair cut. 50/50, what do you think, okay? 10 for you, 10 for me. 10 for you, 10 for me. 10 for you, 10 for me. 10 for you, 10 for me. Five for you, five for me. Here, it's your share. - I don't want it. Keep it for yourself. - Huh? Really? It was a hard night for you. - But not as hard as for you. I hope you'll enjoy it later, hmm? - Huh? Huh? - Come on, give our money back. - I nearly died fighting that boxer, and you just used my life for gambling! Our friendship's over! It's not my business. Enjoy your winnings, old friend. - Wait, Alex! - Get him! - Okay, the money's here, take it if you can. Alex! - Come on. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Hurry up. - Ow ow ow ow. - You're all cowards! Now listen, Alex. You shouldn't make jokes like that. - That'll make you learn there's no easy money, understand? - Well done, well done. You two are good. - I don't think we've met before. Wait, do you want to get the money back you just lost? If that's the case, we're ready for you any time. We were just warming up! - Hey. What do you want? - I want to make you an offer. - An offer, huh? Let's hear it. - 200,000 U.S.. - Huh? 200 thou! Oh. - For a month's contract. - What's the job? - You don't have to know that. As soon as you say yes, you'll get 50%. When the job's done, you'll get the rest of it. - What do you think? - That's 200,000 U.S.! Of course I'll say yes. Hey, but I just want enough for tonight. We gotta celebrate first. - That's right! - Mhmm. - Okay. Then we'll meet here tomorrow. - Damn, they're gone. - What do we do now? - Let's go. Hi! I was just looking for you guys. What are you doing? Put the guns down. - Watch it, be careful of accidents. - Tell me who you are. Why did you follow us? - Well, it's a lot of money. We gotta make sure that it's true, right Kiwi? - That's right. That's right, yeah. - Don't you lie to us, or you're dead! - Hmm? Hey, I'm telling you the truth, what's wrong? We're talking about money! 200,000, am I right? If you can't afford it, you can back out anytime. Tell me who sent you! And why are you recruiting? - You better talk! Son of a bitch! Talk now! - Huh? Stop him! - What's the good news? Got something on Moon? - No, not yet. But we succeeded in decoding San Rafaele's message. - Well, you two are intelligent. - Well of course. That's why they call me Computer. - Hey, what did the messages say? - Never before have we had so many difficulties in decoding as this one, but at least we can get a brief idea what the target of their plan really is. The four chief commissioner's right here in the Thai government. - Thailand has improved a lot recently, politically and economically. But if four chief commissioners are somehow assassinated, that sure will cause problems. By then, San Rafaele can spread his power. - I have already informed the Thai Secret Service and they will start taking some precautions shortly. - So our duty's over now. - Of course not. What about Moon? - Don't worry, Moon's one of our best angels. She'll take care of herself, right? - Hello? Yes. We had everything to go one week ago. Don't worry. Everybody's in their best shape. We're sure to get the job done. Yes. I know. The words are... I understand. Have you checked the guest list? And remember one thing, don't say anything to anybody at all about the operation until we're ready to go. That includes Yuki. Maybe I'm just oversuspicious, but there's definitely something wrong with her. Something strange. Well, give me my clothes. - Stay there! What are you doing here? No one's allowed in that room. You've broken a rule. Now get her! - I don't care if these people are angels or devils. What are these Angels? Who are the Angels? Where'd they come from? Why are they my enemies? Why are you afraid of them? I don't really give a goddamn. I don't want to hear the word Angel ever again, do you understand? And nobody will be able to change my plan. I want the whole world to know I'm dangerous and powerful! - Yes! - Drink up. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Well I told you she'd return safely. I had faith in Moon, she's a perfect angel. Right? - Come here. Look what I found. - What is it? - Now look here. About these three words. They are African dialects, but it means nothing when put together. When they're translated, they are cellular, refund, and money. It doesn't make sense. - Cellular, refund, money. Hey Moon, did you hear anything besides these words? - Nothing, they only mentioned the operation and those words. - Hmm. Cellular, refund, money... Cellular. Hey, let's see what'll happen if we break down the letters and recompose them. - Okay. If we take out the first letter, it'll become C-R-M. Taking out the first two, it'll be ceremony. - Karina, go check and see if there'll be a ceremony held soon. - Okay. That's it, this afternoon. The emperor will present awards in a ceremony to some outstanding commissioners. - Which commissioners are they? - They have the commissioners of defense, country affairs, national affairs, and financial secretary-- - The place, how far is it from here? - In Pattaya, 80 kilometers from here. - 80 kilometers? We don't have much time. Mark, inform the Thai Secret Service. Kiwi and I will go there. Moon, you intercept the king. - Yes. - Congratulations. - Smile. Thank you. - Just one more. Smile. - It's a great party. - Yeah, it's the emperor's party. - Yes. - Sir. - Excuse me, I'll be back in a while, I'm sorry. - It's a wonderful party. I've seen so many people. - What? - We're informed someone may attack this place. - Tell the security in charge to get more men here. Understand? - Yes sir. - All right. Well, what are you talking about? Oh yeah. - Sir. The general's called up a red signal. - Get all the men ready. On full alert, go. - Yes sir. - Hmm. - Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated. - Oh, it's time now if you're ready. - The king should be here any minute now, it's 3:00 already. - Security's pretty good for once. - Yes, well, the king, we have to be careful, you see. - Congratulations, Commissioner. Another award. - Thank you, thank you. - Everyone stay still, don't panic. You come here. Check the situation. - Yes sir. Everyone stay still. - Report, sir. All intruders are dead. - Ah, that's good news, yeah. That was a close one. Everyone down. - Come on. - Everyone stay down, don't panic, just stay where you are. Stay where you are, everyone, stay down. - Like this we'll all be killed, now get some more men here! - Come here, come here! Hurry up, will you? Get some more men, the commissioner needs protecting. - No way, there's too many of them. - That's an order, go on! - Yes sir. - Now don't worry, more men'll be here in a minute. - Commissioner. I have bad news. They're not coming. - What do you mean? What do you mean they're not coming! We'll all be killed here! - We can't hang around here any longer. We've got to get back to the house right away! - Yeah, yeah, good idea. Move to the house, come on, move it, move it. - Stay down, stay down. - Kiwi, go help the commissioner, and hurry! - All right, cover me! - Hey, keep me covered. - Hey, we're the Angels! We're here to help you! Don't worry, now move out. Hey, hurry back to the house! - Come on, let's go back to the house! - Hurry, quick! Get in! - Come on. Upstairs! - I set a bomb downstairs. Huh? Oh! - You just missed me. Come on. Mm-mm. - Come Karina. - Oh, those hats are beautiful. - Want a boat ride? Come on, sir. Get in. Watch your step. - Wow. Hi. - Hi. - Hey, where are the girls? Tell them to hurry. - Why don't you tell them? - Well, I was just giving you a good chance. - Not with them. They're not common women, they're Angels. They'll kill you if you mess with them. Hi, hi! - Hey, you want to have a boat ride? Go on, get in there. Come on, boat rides. - Be careful, Mark. You want to drown everyone in the boat? The river stinks. Hey, what's that, your new toy? - This is my new invention, it's a mini bomb detector. - He calls that a new invention. We've had one of those for ages. - Yes, that's true, but mine is different, it's extremely sensitive. And the cost is lower too. - Come on, hurry up. - Look at them, they don't care about us. - Come on. - Hurry up. - Watch your step. - Wait a minute, trouble. - There you go. - All right, everyone. Here we go. - All right. - This is great, we're on our way. - Hey, look there. - Ladies and gentlemen, I'm your tour guide today. We're now on a trip on the famous River Kwai. - You're stupid. We're now traveling on the Mae Nan River. - Mae Non River? Are you sure? - Of course I am. What grade did you get in your geography examination? You're not qualified to be a guide. - Go on. - Hey hey hey, come here, come here. I want some pineapples. Miss. Are your pineapples fresh? - Yes. - Really? I hope you're not lying. Alex, what do you think? - Seems good. - Huh? Huh?! Hey, there's a bomb in there! - Huh?! Not again! - Just a few seconds left! It's gonna blow! - Hey, you look stupid, hey, how do you feel? - Oh, it was them. - That's right, don't mess with women or you'll be in trouble.
