Why? - How much? - About 2,800 bucks. - I'll make you a deal. If you drive me for the next three days I'll buy you that horse. - Are you serious? - It's a down payment. - That's 1,000 bucks. Where you going, Rio? - Seattle via Minneapolis. - Just out of curiosity, why don't you own a car? - I don't drive. Do we have a deal? - That's a long way from Detroit to Seattle. 5,000. That covers all expenses and hazard pay. - 4,000, no questions. Do we have a deal? Seven, eight, nine, this is $1,000! - Yeah, that's what that is.

What are you doing with that? - Ben, you're taking ne of my babies out of state. This is insurance. - How long we been together? Now I really feel that you're taking unfair advantage of me here. You should treat me better than this. - So, is she for real or what? - I'll let you know.

Fresh air. - Look, I'd like to sleep a bit, okay? - Tell you what. Let me ask you just a few questions, then I'll let you sleep. What do you say? - Three questions. - What's the story with that guy back there, the one who was after you? - He was somebody I was seeing. We broke up. He's not handling it very well. Next question. - Why Minneapolis and Seattle? - I have a friend in Minneapolis. Seattle is home. Next? - Don't rush me. What's your favorite color? - Black. - Want a lullaby? Shut up. - Our young congressman. What a waste. This could have been a good gig. I want this apartment flushed. - Shit! - I'd like to get there in one piece, if you don't mind. - Yeah, sorry.

Who are you? - Now where's 409? - I don't know. - Try again. - Some joint in a town called Riverside.

Here, pick one. - Do they work? - Only if you believe. - Oh, that must be Anna. - Help yourself. - Sorry. How did it end? - She killed herself. - I had a younger sister. She died when I was seven. I didn't know anything about death then except that it hurt. I remember my mother in the kitchen chair. I climbed into her lap and clung to her, but she wouldn't hold me. She just let me slide right off of her right onto the floor like I wasn't even there. - Why are you telling me this? - I don't know. Listen, I won't be going to Seattle. You can just drop me off at Billings. It's gonna be a much shorter trip for you. - Don't tell me, another ex-boyfriend? - I have a friend, a doctor. She's the only one who can help me. - Help you what? - I've got to get out of the country. - You mean to tell me there is nothing you can do to stop this guy? - No, there's nothing I can do.

Maybe we're looking for some of the same things. Then I was thinking how could you possibly know what you really want because you're so busy running away. Why don't you tell me what this trip is really about? - I don't know what you're talking about. - We're talking about whatever happened to your friend last night, about the guy who's chasing us, and why you have to carry a gun? - I think it's time to go. - Why the big mystery? What the hell are you running from? - Who the hell do you think you are? You have no right to know anything about me. Let me tell you something, Ben. You're just some cab driver who takes me where I want to go. That's all, and if you can't handle this I'll find somebody who can. - Good luck. - Oh, that's just great. - Your fucking royal highness. Stand out there and freeze your ass off. How the fuck did I get myself into this shit hole? Freezing my ass off, sleeping in fucking cars, this is bullshit.

Cindy. - Christina! - Dr. Kleinberg, call on line six. - Jesus Christ. Vanessa. Are you all right? - Quinn is behind me. - You've got a choice. You can tell me what's going on right now, or you can talk to the police. - Trust me, Ben. The less you know about it, the better. - No, no, no. Me or the police. - I work for the CIA. - Oh, great. You expect me to believe that? - Think about it, Ben. You've heard about a man named Eric Weaver? - Yes, I've heard of Eric Weaver. I voted for him. - He's dead. He had a hell of a career in front of him, but the people I work for like the control careers. They like to get a little something on everyone, so I was sent to get involved with Eric, only things didn't go as planned, so now they've sent Quinn to kill me. - You expect me to believe this? - It's the truth. They want me dead. Who wants you dead? - Does it matter? - Why did we go to Minneapolis? - We had to see a contact, somebody who could bring me in. - And, what happened? - He's dead. - Oh, good. And, what about your friend back here? - She was just a friend. She wasn't involved. - And, I'm just the guy who's supposed to take you wherever you want to go, is that it? Well, I got new for you. We're going to the police. - You're taking me to a train station. - I don't want the money. Not twice in the same night. Now toss that gun as far as you can. Do it. Good. Now step down. - Why are you doing this? - If I don't kill you, they'll just send somebody to kill us both. The buck stops with you. - Don't! Don't touch that gun, put it down! Come back here, come right over here. Get up, you. Stop, stop. - I'm FBI. - Bullshit. Shut up, give me the gun. - Don't fucking move! - What, do you want to see ID? I'm Agent Quinn, Washington Bureau. What's she been telling you? She's CIA, undercover, on some secret mission? - Turn around. - What? - I said turn the fuck around. Put your hands up. Reach into your pocket with your right hand, and take your ID out, pass it over your shoulder. - You want to know her real name? It's Christina Roggio, and I've been after her for a very long time. - He's lying, Ben. - Shut up. Turn around. That makes you a very busy guy, chasing her all around the country, taking shots at me, and selling upholstery. - No. I had to find out if you were involved. I'm convinced you're not. You're just being used like all her men. - If you give him the gun, he's gonna kill both of us. - Right, and I'm supposed to trust you. - Do what you have to do. - Don't move! Don't fucking move! - She's going for the gun. You. You've been a problem right from the beginning. Say goodbye. Oh, you bitch. - There you go. How you doing? Excuse me. check ? 05.04.2020
