(MultiCom Jingle) ♫ They are the radio and one in the southwest ♫ They only are the radio in south Texas is the best - [Radio Man] Heavy rain continuing through the night clearing tomorrow. And now here's an update on the car bombing in Dallas. Building contractor Larry Wayne is in critical condition at parkland hospital. The Texas Ranger organized crime unit is investigating. Good luck boys. Now, back to our music. ♫ The world I know is dying ♫ Begging for its time ♫ Some folks say I'm an outlaw ♫ To me it's just a frame ♫ You can call me what you will ♫ Changing's not my game ♫ Life don't feel the same no more ♫ Somethings just not right ♫ Men have lost the courage. - Dang is it pouring out there, TJ. How we doing tonight, anything happening? - No, no calls. - Nothing up? - Nah, big fat nadda. - Listen TJ, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about. - [TJ] Yeah? - How's the diet coming? - What are you, my mother? - No TJ, what I am is your friend. And you know you got less than three months before your next annual. - I'll make it. - Well not unless you get off your ass and get some exercise and you stop eating those damn doughnuts. ♫ You can call me what you will (tires screeching) - Keep cool. (thrilling music) Hey Hombre. (men speaking Spanish) (gun firing) - Start the car. (speaking Spanish) - Look. There's so many other buildings. - [Tony] If we get out of Texas we're safe, right? (engine stuttering) - Shit. We gotta get a car. - You know you're the most qualified deputy sheriff in the whole damn state. All them years up in Dallas and that training must be worth something. - That shit in Dallas wasn't all my fault. I didn't kill all those people all by myself. - Most of em'. - I bagged my limit that day, that's for sure. - Of course you know TJ, I think I, I might've kept the senators brother out of it. - He was doing dirty. He pays the price just like all us ordinary folk. - Yeah. So you get booted out of Dallas and I end up with the deputy sheriff in Texas. Somehow just don't seem fair. - Yeah, Mamma never said life was fair. I fucked up. I paid the price. - Listen, man, I'm gonna go see the old lady. You take care. If anything happens, give me a call. - Alright. - [Bob] Get some sleep, alright? - Yeah. Oh Bob, wait a minute. - [Bob] Yeah? - [TJ] Photos came back from the drug store. - Let me see. Look at that. Isn't that nice? - Yeah Trevor's a cute kid alright. You're a lucky man, Bob. - Yeah. - Hey. Who is it out there messing with our cars on a night like this? Hey, hold it right there you guys! (gun firing) Hold it right there! (guns firing) (grim music) - You killed a cop! - Listen. Would you rather explain to them what we are doing out here in the middle of nowhere? Come on, the border's got to be somewhere near here. Once we're out of the United States we'll be free. Then it's Europe, kiddo, it's Europe. Let's go, come on. Hey. This is it, Tony! We found it, the border. Look! - [TJ] Stop! Right there. - Relax, Tony. We've got the border here. You can do nothing to us! You're American. We across the border. - That border don't mean shit to me. Just a line in the dirt. You think you can take me? Go ahead on. It's your move. (gun firing) - You son of a bitch! Tony! Tony! Tony. - Hey! - You son of a bitch. You don't have the right to do this. - I got all the right I need. Now get off your knees you son of a bitch. Come on, you yellow belly bastard. Go for it, I want you to draw. Come on! What's the matter, shooting people from the dark more your style? You think you can take me, go ahead on. It's your move. - You'll pay for my brother, I swear, you'll pay. - This guy ain't your fuckin' brother. If he killed my brother I'd probably kill your ass. Now get up, go for your gun! - You'll see my gun when the time comes. I swear on God you're gonna pay for this, you bastard. - That guy you killed back there was my partner. I outta kill you on general principle. Instead I'm gonna take you to Texas Injustice. You got the right to remain silent. (groan) And all that other shit. - [Agent] Thomas Jefferson Geronimo the third. - Apache, it was pronounced Hiranimo. - Apache Texas Sheriff, this is real company. You'll be working with the Italian authorities on this so just do as you're told. My god this is gonna be a wonderful piece of international PR. - About my job in extradite. I'm a deputy sheriff not a border patrol agent. You can also tell me your abrasion boys on this. - Normally I would but you're still American heroes are being tight, you want to be the Texas Sheriff and all they want is a personal thank you for catching this guy. - What I get out of this? - A medal. - A medal? I'm gonna frost their ass in Dallas. - Now you see Mr. Palermo's been a major source of embarrassment to the Italian government. He's made contracts in four continents that went off. - Been a busy boy, huh? - I get around, cowboy. Hey, what makes you think you can handle a guy like me? You don't know anything. You're going to Europe. (speaking Spanish) - If I known you's was gonna be such a fuss, I'da dusted your ass back on the border when I had the chance. - Oh you'll get your chance, cowboy. You can make a book on it. - Just turn Mr. Palermo over to the Italian authorities and get them to sign him off, you go back to Texas and enjoy yourself. - Who knows, you might like Europe. (elegant upbeat music) - Darling, what is your name? - No thanks, shut up. (beeping) - I'll patch through. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your pilot speaking. We're experiencing some technical difficulties. Nothing to be alarmed about. However we will not be proceeding on to Sicily. We will be landing at the nearest island, Malta. - The hell's Malta? - [Attendant] It's a big island nearby. - So like Ellington? (upbeat instrumental music) Ma'am. When's this place gonna be ready to go on to Sicily? - We're sorry, it appears not until tomorrow. We've made the arrangements for overnight accommodations, you must be suited customers. - Oh thank you. Just great. Here you go. Thanks. - Yes, sir. - Put those bags in the back, will you pal? - Sure. Okay where to next? - Police headquarters. - Police headquarters, are you in some trouble, sir? - Just drive me to police headquarters and carry this up front will you? - I do boss, I do boss, yes sir, boss. Where do you come from Tex? - [TJ] Texas. - Oh Texas, I knew, I knew. Do you John Wayne? American's eh? - Hey pal, you're on the wrong side of the road. - No, no. I'm alright. We're on the left side, here we drive on the left. British have taught us to drive on the left. You from Sicily? (speaking Spanish) - Ah, Siliano. - Hey. Hey, did I not tell not to, hey! Didn't I tell you not to talk to him? Tell you what, how 'bout you just shut your mouth and take me to the police station, huh? - Okay Tex. Do you know Winston Churchill? Yeah he said once that brought us the unsinkable aircraft carrier. And all the German bombers come. The junkers was too constant, the Measuresmits and they come to bombard us. I don't know how we managed to survive. - [TJ] Come on, come on, get out of here. Move it. - Pull over, dammit! (gun firing) - Pull over. - [Driver] Please don't shoot. - Don't worry. It's almost too perfect. (gun firing) (thrilling music) (guns firing) (explosions) (chuckling) - Alright, fine. The balance goes in to the sum account. Of course. I am certain. Alright, fine. I hate doing business with Emetos. Not like us. Right, Joseph? - You take care of business, Don Lamanna. I just do what you want of me. In the meantime I appreciate your assistant at the airport. - And you're always welcome at my humble vacation retreat in Malta. - This is spectacular, Don Lamanna. It's really magnificent. Really. Fantastic. But I wanna go back to my home in Sicily. - Joseph. I am afraid you're not aware of your fame. You know it'll be different this time. The dalian of Sicily could make it very difficult for both of us. To be seen seen anywhere in Italy. You're just going to have to stay here awhile. But I'll get you another assignment soon. In another country. While in the meantime, enjoy my hospitality. - Anna, can you put some oil on my back, please? - I'll do it. - That's enough, Mr. Palermo. Thank you, that's enough. Oh please. You hurting me, please. - You want a nice sun tan don't you, baby? - Yes, but, but. Please. Stop it, please. It's hurting, you're very strong, please. - We don't want a pretty ol' thing like you getting burned. Do you hurt, baby? - Yes but, please. - Are you hurt? - Joseph? - Please. Oh no. My hair's all wet. - Who cares about your hair, huh? Come on I need some action out here. - Joseph, it's better you stay at the house. You know I can't control the Malta police. - But I'm bored, I got to smashing. Besides, nobody knows in Malta. - What about the police officer from America? - Well the cowboy's dead. Burned and blown to bits in a taxi. Guy's fried, fried Texas beef. - Perhaps. But you did come through customs? - Yeah. - I think it is best if you stay here. Good. - Superintendent Mifsud would like to see you. - [TJ] Alright. - Yes. - [Guard] Excuse me, Mifsud. You wanted to see the American? - Yes, I'll get to you later. Sorry if I have arrested you. Sheriff Geronimo but, you understand. But I do have few words. - Pronounced Heranimo. - Oh yes, yes, you have my personal apologies. - Not necessary. - You also see here, Mr. Wilson in Washington is on my speaker point. And he would like to talk to you. Please, do sit down. Mr. Wilson, are you there? - Yes, go ahead. - Let me apologize once again for disturbing you at your home at this late hour in America. - That's perfectly alright Superintendent Mifsud. Is Geronimo with you? - Yes sir, he's right here. - You screwed it up, cowboy, what happened? - As near as we can tell, Palermo's people in some way tempered with the airplane and force it to land before it could get to Sicily. - Now you listen to me, Geronimo. The Malties and the Italian authorities will handle this from now. I want you to catch the next plane back to the United States and file your report, you understand? - You saying I set up? - That's what the man said, cowboy. Guess you were right. I should've sent one of my boys from immigration instead of a small town Texas sheriff. Superintendent Mifsud, thank you once again for your assistance. And Geronimo, you have your orders. Thank you again, Superintendent, goodbye. - Always a pleasure to help. Goodbye Mr. Wilson. I'm very sorry that this happened here. We are a small, peaceful country, Sheriff. I assure you, nothing like this has ever happened here before. - How you gonna catch this guy? - You rest easy on that, Sheriff Geronimo. Your friend Mr. Palermo will not get of the island. The airport is carefully guarded. He'll never get passed our security. - Yeah well maybe I can help after all, I do know what the bastard looks like. - We have a full description on the attacker, and therefore it is our wiring a foot. However, I do appreciate your gesture of our systems but we will handle this. For now, we have checked in at the Corrintia Palace Hotel. The next flight to America is tomorrow morning to London. I will assign one of my best people to show you around the islands 'till then. I think you will find one of the most pleasant. - Where's my gun? - Oh, yes of course you may have your gun. However, let's be cautiousness, Sheriff. The police in Malta do not usually carry weapons. - I do. Look I can be assistance to your people. I got an idea how he thinks. - No, no, no, no, I will handle this. It would improper to use your assistance after your Superintendent Wilson ordered you back to America. Officer Maria Cassar will be happy to show you around Malta. - Yes I can show you around, it's beautiful. - You must learn to relax, Joseph. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - I have a new assignment coming up in a few weeks. - What? - The far east. - Good, I like catching cuisine, besides I haven't been there in almost a year. - Oh has it been that long? - Whose ticket? - Quebec. - I'm ready, when do I go? - I'll get you off this island in less than a week. - A week? Please, Don Lamanna, I'll get crazy without doing anything here. Come on, please. - Where goes your age, Joseph? - I sometimes have beshaded the weak away from the world. Right girls? (humming) - [Joseph] Here baby, huh? (screaming) (festive music) (knocking on door) - Come on in, it's open. Leave it on the table. - Superintendent Geronimo? - Oh I thought it was room service. It's Geronimo. Deputy Sheriff Geronimo. What you want? - Superintendent Mifsud send to me see if I can help you with anything. - Only thing I really want here, honey, is Palermo. I don't think you can help me there. - Oh certainly we'll capture him, he can't possibly get away, Superintendent Mifsud will see to that. In the meantime since you've got the rest of the day with nothing to do and it's carnival time, I thought maybe I can show you around our island. - Nah, thanks anyway, honey. Carnival? You say big carnival? This what that noise all about? Do you really think Palermo might still be on this little piece of rock you call Malta? - Positive. - How big is this place? - Well the main island's only nine miles wide by 17 miles long. - Well that's like being in Texas. Yeah. Might be pretty hard to hide in a place like this. I think I will take a look around, talk to some people. Not getting anything done in this hotel room. (thrilling music) - Hi. - Tal, Harley, who's inside? - Anna and Gina are dancing. - Good, good. - I'm telling you, this guy is rough. And he's son of a bitch from Sicily. - Then why don't you tell him to get lost? - You don't tell a guy like this anything, believe me. - How long he's staying with Master Lamanna? - Too long. And I'm not taking this abuse. - So what are you going to do? - I'm going to talk Lamanna. Maybe he'll understand me. - Girls, you're getting paid to dance. Get your asses on the stage, quick. - Alright. ♫ Run while you can ♫ Because the man has got his gun in hand ♫ You better run ♫ While you can ♫ 'Cause he won't stop 'till he gets man ♫ You better run ♫ You better hide ♫ You better run ♫ 'Cause he won't stop 'till he gets his man (festive music) - [Maria] Hey wait, where you going? Wait, wait. - Watch out, Sheriff. - Stay out of this! Halt. Right there. Joseph Palermo. Where is he? (eerie music) Think you can take me? Go ahead on. It's your move. (gun firing) Halt, wait a minute. Don't do anything stupid with that kid. - Get back, I'll blow its brains out. - Come on, let go you spineless bastard. - Come here, bitch. - Look here, I'm putting it away. Come on, let's talk. - [Man] I don't know where Palermo is, I don't what you're talking about. Stay away from me. - Come on. Don't do anything. Think you can take me? Go ahead on. It's your move. (gun firing) - [Boy] Mom! (crying) - Superintendent Mifsud would like to see you. - [TJ] Alright. How you doin'? - Really sir, you must listen to the story from the beginning then you will understand what really happened. - Excuse me sir. - Please. You want to see the American? - Ah, yes. Yes. Mr. Wilson from Washington would like to speak to you. Are you there Mr. Wilson? - God dammit Geronimo, what the hell is going on over there? We've had excellent relations with Malto for over 100 years. You trying to change all that? Now what the hell's going on? - The situation demanded action. What I did was appropriate. I recognized the bastard that helped Palermo get loose from me so I tried to arrest him. - That is correct, sir, the situation was dictated by the suspects. - They weren't suspected god dammit. - Now look, cowboy. You do exactly as Superintendent Mifsud says, do you read me Geronimo? Exactly. Then get your ass on the next plane back to Texas. Do you read me? - I read you, sir. - Superintendent Mifsud, thank you for your understanding and once again, let me apologize on behalf of the United States government for the actions of Sheriff Geronimo. - Apology accepted. - [Mr. Wilson] Thank you. And if I can be of any further assistance, please let me know. - Yes, I will. Let's hope we have no further needs for your assistance. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Where's my gun? - Your weapon? - Yeah. - Your weapon is staying locked in my desk until you leave on tomorrows plane. Understand? - It's your country. - Please try and remember that. - Really sir, I must protest Geronimo did nothing-- - It's alright, honey. Situation's all been settled hasn't it, Superintendent Mifsud? - Don Lamanna. I'm sorry. I thought the American was dead. I saw that damn taxi blew and I thought that buster was fried. - And you're obviously incorrect. Now see how my men were attacked. You have placed me in a very embarrassing position. It'll be very costly, if I'm even suspected, Palermo. - You won't be suspected. I'll get rid of that cowboy once and for all. I'll make sure that. He won't leave this island live. As long as his death will be silent. - Perhaps I better call someone in from Rome to help us. 30 hours tops for this American. - No, please. I owe this cowboy. He killed Tony. This is family. I demand the right to handle this myself. You won't be disappointed Don Lamanna. You have my word. - Alright. I'll accept your word, Joseph. Do not fail me. - Get some local boys right away. We got to take care of this, find where the cowboy is and let me know. I'll be at Smuggler's Terror. - Don Lamanna says, you should stay out the villa. - You just do what you're told. - Look, thanks for speaking up for me in there, honey. But it really wasn't necessary. - I didn't do it for you, I did it 'cause it was the truth and it's my job to tell the truth. - Oh great, is that what you think a job is? - Yeah well, partly. - Yeah well the way I see it, it's the law's job to get the lawbreakers off the street. Make the street safe for the good people, get rid of the scum. - What about the law? The police officer must obey that too. - Say pal, got any Maylocks? - Maylocks? No sir. - Then bring me a tall glass of milk, okay? - Glass of milk, yes sir. - And the check. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Look Officer Cassar, let me set you straight about the law. Now of course the lawmen must obey the law. But the law must be just. Now there's lots of bad people out there using the law for their own things. Well some of us gotta stand up for justice. - Seems awful simple to me. - It is. 'Till politicians and the lawyers get involved, you know how they are. - Your milk, sir. - Thank you. Appreciate it. - Are you sure you're okay? - Yeah sure I'm fine, thank you. Well I did get shot up a few years ago in Dallas. Sometimes it acts up a bit. - I bet you're not too small to eat food. - Oh no, food's good, thank you. Sure is a lot of it too. Honey how much is it that American money? - On the Malta Police Department. - Oh well thank you little lady. Mamma taught me never to pass up a free meal. Fancy hill. - [Cassar] Malta can be a very nice place. There's lots of good people here. - [TJ] Yeah good and bad people everywhere. Lived here all your life? - [Cassar] Yes. - You ever been off the beach and rock? - Of course. Rome's only an hour away. Have you ever been to Rome? - Nah, I've never been out of Texas before this. - Well I want you to know that we get Palermo. - Yeah but Palermo's good. He's very experienced and he is very good. The airport taxi driver paid the price. And in Texas, my partner paid the price. So you see I owe him. It's real personal. - He'll be caught. You can count on it. - Well I hope so. I'm hoping soon they'll get it done. You got to go out and find that some bitch. Come on. ♫ I get hunt ♫ When I hear that music ♫ Hot rock ♫ Rock and roll music ♫ Hear that girl ♫ I'm high, I'm higher than you ♫ Don't you keep me raging, raging too long - What can I get you? - I'll have some on the rocks. - We don't have mixed drinks. Beer, wine or street to Decai Polly? - The stripe bourbon, okay? Try. - Don Lamanna. I'm honored, what can I get you? - Nothing, thank you. I'd like to see you in the back. - Get the word to the cowboy that I'm in his park. We move on with him, K? - Hey, Joseph. I'm very disappointed in you, Joseph. Not only did you disobeyed my wishes let you in my villa. But you bring the American here. Here to an establishment owned by me. - I will not involve you or any of your business, Don Lamanna. - You may be underestimating the American. - I can handle the American. He's just stupid cat from Texas. He'll be dead in one hour. Go back to the villa and you get no troubles from me. - Do not involve me in your personal vendetta. - I'll owe you for this and I won't forget. Alice. Get out of here. - [Joseph] Alright let's go, out! - Joseph. You can have the American. But you must get us closer. - Alright. If you'll excuse me, I got some business to attend to. - Okay. - He's a peak. A brutish peak, who cause you nothing but trouble. - Must never speak like that about one of my associates. Mr. Palermo has made lots of money for me over the years. He must have our respect. Understand? - Yes, sir. - Alright. Oh Anna. You look beautiful. - Thank you Don Lamanna, how nice of you to come. - Thank you. I haven't been in, in almost a year. Gina come here. Don't cry. I guess I should come more often to check on my investments. Right, girls? - [TJ] We have to find Palermo at once. - [Cassar] My instructions are to show you around our island. - But I'm not here as a damn tourist, I'm here to get Palermo. Where do you keep the broads? - [Cassar] How do you mean? - [TJ] Hookers, hustlers, prostitutes? - [Cassar] Well years ago when sailors used to come to our island there was a place called The Gut but. - That'll be it, which way is it? If you're a pig like Palermo, you go to pig side way of wallas. Well excuse me. I hate to interrupt your business but, looking for this Italian in Joe Palermo, he's about six feet tall, 180 pounds, real sharp dresser, I wondered if you could help me find him. Take American money? - [Broad] Yeah all currencies. - Well look I'm not an expensive cat, so 20 bucks is gonna have to do, huh? - Well, you'll find him In Smuggler's Tavern. It's two blocks up from here. And then go left to game. - You know this place? Alright thank you, honey. And you better not be lying to me. - No. (eerie music) (festive singing) - That was the tavern. - We're being setup. There's a guy on the balcony up there. It's an ambush. There's two more. Palermo's men. You watch my back. (splashing) (pot shattering) (gun firing) - [Cassar] Watch out! (guns firing) - Hold it right there, Sheriff! Maria! Maria! I want every police officer in Malta to get this order, arrest Sheriff Geronimo on sight. He is armed and dangerous. Use what precaution is necessary. - Yes, sir. (thrilling music) (gun firing) (gun firing) - It's a church. (gun firing) - Thanks a lot now I only got one shot left. You see him? - No I don't know where he went. - Take a look around. (eerie music) - Father. Father, father. I want to confess. - [Joseph] I can't. - But please, father I want to confess. - [Joseph] Please. - Okay father, are you ready to go through with it? I do charity but my husband drowned me so I shout and I scream loud. - Anything you say. - What? - Anything you say. - What do you think I want? What, father? - Don't worry sister, please, please, just relax. - I'll go look behind these side doors. Do we need a priest? They locked or what? - No they won't be locked. - But father, father. I remembered something, I have more sins to confess. - Hold that, pal. Hey. Palermo. (thrilling music) (guns firing) I'm looking out of bullets. We're running blindfold. (guns clicking) - Wait, hold on. - Why? We're both out of bullets. Maria! Do you see him? - No, I don't know where he is. - Well keep looking. (fists thudding) (groaning) (wood thudding) (thrilling music) (boat engine racing) (chuckling) (fist thudding) - [Man] Sheriff Geronimo. This is Malties Police Department, you're under arrest, do not move, remain where you are. - [Joseph] Don Lamanna, let me explain. - I already know the details, Sir Joseph. You have failed. - No, no, not yet, I'll get this bastard, I swear it. - You have done many jobs for me. Many times over the years. You are the best. The best because you had no feeling or emotion and now you are trying. - He killed Tony. This is special. - You've had your chance. - Give me 24 hours, I'll kill him, I swear it. - I'm afraid not, Joseph. I called in some boys from Rome. - [Joseph] Don Lamanna, please. The heat in the forest is a gift to you for the American. Give me 24 hours, that's all I ask. - 24 hours. Him or you. - Officer Cassar told me what happened. I guess it couldn't be helped. But you are a walking disaster area, Sheriff. The last violence will have the Mordawasump kids blowing up the toilets at the airport. You come to our country and are abolishing the city. You use our country like your own private shooting range. I realized that your name is that of a great American Indian warrior. But this why this must stop. - Well I couldn't agree with you more. Palermo's men started shooting at me. I had to defend myself. - Yes, yes I see what you mean. - Well look, I still think I can help you guys. I mean I've tracked him in Texas, I've chased him all over this island of yours. I know him, I know how he thinks. I can get that bastard. - Sheriff Geronimo. If there is one more incident, just one more caused by you or not. As God as my judge I will keep you in custody until your plane leaves tomorrow. I want your word as an American police officer that you will cause no more problems. - As an American police officer? - Yes. - You got my word. Your boss is wrong, Maria. This ain't gonna stop. Look, that bastard killed my partner. I killed his brother. There ain't no way this gonna end up with both of us walking around. - But you gave your word to Superintendent Mifsud. - I gave my word as to an American police officer. Hell, I'm a Texas lawman. - Please don't do anything yet, Superintendent Mifsud will surely put you away this time, believe me. - I believe you but that ain't the problem. The problem is I gotta find Palermo before he finds me. The only lead we got's a walky talky by somebody from Smuggler's Tavern where he set me up. Im'a go talk to them good ol' boys. It's no good you being with me, I mean it's nothing personal. It's that damn uniform. Nobody's gonna talk to me when you're around. - But think of it more perspective police uniform. - Yeah sure, look, this is the only lead we got. Now your boss is kicking me off the island tomorrow and I'ma get Palermo, it's gotta be before then, okay? - I have my orders. - I under stand orders but listen. Give me five minutes, just give me a little break, I'll be right back out I guarantee it. - [Bartender] What will it be, Tex? - Got any Maylocks? - Maylocks? What the hell is that? - Just give me a tall glass of milk. - Milk? - Hey! We got a real American cowboy here. - Sorry, Tex. No milk. - Why don't you help me. Looking for this Italian guy named Joe Palermo. About six feet tall, 180 pounds. He's a nice dresser. - I just serve drinks. I don't pay attention who drinks them. - I wouldn't like it if I found out you was lying to me. - I know of the Italian. - I'm talking to this man here. Just mind your business and drink your beer. - You don't like beer, Tex? He likes milk. Here. Have some of my tea. - [Man] He likes the mother of milk. (laughing) Go back to America! Get out of here cowboy! - Tell you what shit for brains. Why don't you just get down here and clean them boots. Then we'll talk about Italian's. - Now hold it, hold it! Just a minute! (upbeat rock music) Now I don't want any trouble here. - Stop this fighting! - What's the matter you guys, huh? (men shouting) (glass shattering) (wood shattering) (whistles blowing) I just came in here for some milk, sir. Yeah, I know. Superintendent Mifsud wants to see me, I know the way. Thanks, pal. - Excuse me sir, American. - It has been a long day, Sheriff. We in Malta will tell stories of you to our great grandchildren. - No, no, I didn't start that ruckus. - Ruckus? That's what you call it? My superiors feel that you should be locked up for a very long time. How do you feel about that? - I wouldn't like it, sir. - No, I suppose you wouldn't. Our jails are not as comfortable as yours in America, are they? - Well actually I wish ours were a lot more like yours. - Flattery will not help your situation here, Sheriff. Actually I am to blame. If Officer Maria Cassar had been with you this would not have happened. I guess she was not ready for this assignment. - Wait a minute, it wasn't her fault, she didn't have a think to do with this. - Oh don't trouble yourself. Officer Cassar has been relieved of further responsibility regarding her assist. - Is she gonna be reassigned? - That is correct. - Well it's your business but let me tell you, she's one hell of a fine officer. - Thank you. - Say, how 'bout give me about 10 minutes with that bartender and I can get that information out him. - I'm not sure if you understand the positives here, Sheriff. My superiors have instructed me a clear task. You are no longer involved with this case. I have personally questioned the bartender and has no knowledge of Mr. Palermo. - Yeah well let me talk to him, I can get the information-- - [Mifsud] Your plane leaves in less than 10 hours. May I suggest you stay in your hotel and you will be escorted to the airport tomorrow. - I'm under house arrest? - [Mifsud] You could stay in your cell if you prefer. - Hey cut me some slack-- - Sheriff Geronimo. The choice is yours. Your hotel or your cell. - Well hotel but hey pal, come here, I wanna talk to you. Wait a minute, listen. Say pal, tell me something. About Malta. Was that really a falcon? - Well yes as a matter of fact it was, it's a long time. You okay? (groaning) Hey, hey. - Look. I got work to do pal. Sorry about this. - Go away, we're closed. I don't want anymore trouble. - Well that's exactly what you're gonna get unless I get some answers about that Italian. Now look at that. You know, my ancestors... they used to skin their enemies. Just peel the skin right off the bone. Take a sharp knife and just cut layer after layer of flesh. Real experts. The Apaches. You've heard of the Apaches, haven't ya? Say maybe you wanna tell me where I can find this Joe Palermo? Or maybe before I show you more about how to skin somebody. - Well alright. I know this Italian guy who's been messing with one of my dancers. That's all. - Where is she? - In there in the dressing room. - Better not be lying to me. - I don't need this job but. Why don't we speak to those soft fingers. - What you don't need, is trouble from me. Now that Italian is a pussycat compared to me. - You don't know but, I am a bad lady. If I'm even seen with you. - I'll protect you. - I hear you're looking for me. You're gonna have some fun, cowboy. Wanna fight? Come on, cowboy. Fight. - [TJ] Wait a minute. Wait, no. Wait a minute. - [Joseph] Your hours are numbered, cowboy. - What? - I'm gonna make your death real slow. You're gonna pay for my brother. You're gonna pay for him. I'm gonna have a lot of fun. - Yeah well fuck you. - What did you tell the cowboy about? - [Gina] Nothing, Mr. Palermo. I wouldn't say nothing. - Good girl. (shouting) I know you wouldn't, Gina, baby. You know what would happen to you if you did don't you? - Yes I know honey. But I wouldn't say nothing to nobody about nothing. Oh mister. - You good lass girl. A good lass, huh? (shouting) You got to learn who's the boss is you know? (humming) (eerie music) - You said you'd protect me. Did you mean it? - I know Palermo. I won't underestimate him again. You've got my word. - Okay. - [TJ] Where is he? - [Gina] Upstairs. - Surprise asshole! Shit. (groaning) (gun firing) (guns firing) - Give it up, cowboy! You've got nowhere to go. Bitch got what she deserved. Come inside. I'm going to make it easy on you. That little injection I gave you wasn't so bad now was it? Maybe you like a little more huh? (shouting) There he is, get him! (guns firing) He's heading to the boat, let's go! (boat engine revving) There he is. Come on, let's get him! Get this sucker, come on! (guns firing) (explosions) (chuckling) I got that son of a bitch! I got him. I don't see him. He is with the fishes. Goodbye, cowboy. This time I'm sure that fossil is dead, I got him. - Where is the body? - At the bottom of the Mediterranean. - How can you be so certain? - Don Lamanna, we were several miles at sea. The explosion, Lamanna, would kill anyone. - The American has proven that he is just not anyone. Well. Let's hope that this is done. - He has been missing for five days, Mr. Wilson. We have combed the island for him. If this man Palermo got him I'm afraid he must be dead. Probably buried somewhere far out at sea. We'll never find his body. - I don't think so, sir. - What makes you say that? - I'm just not convinced that Sheriff Geronimo is dead. - Me too, sir, I think he's still alive. - I feel it. (elegant music) Excuse me, sir, you wanted my final report on Cheriff Geronimo? - Yes I do. - Well I still can't believe it but, nobody's seen or heard from him on the whole island. - Well I can't stay here any longer, I gotta get back to the states. I'll be leaving tomorrow. As far as I'm concerned, Thomas Jefferson Geronimo the third is dead. (elegant music) - Well you know how to get it, a little more practice. Pull it back hard. Marie, let me try. I used to hunt squirrels and jack rabbits back in Texas. That's how we ate. Goodbye. Thanks a million! - Can I help you, sir? - [TJ] No, thanks padre. - Geronimo. - It's the American, Superintendent Mifsud. - Sheriff Geronimo. We have given you up for dead. - Well sorry about that. - Well, well, cowboy. I was about ready to wire condolences to Texas. - Well Wilson, I guess you'll have to send another cable, huh? Now that bartender knows where Palermo is. - Now just a minute, Geronimo. You've already been in enough trouble with these fine people. I want you on the next plane to Texas. Once you're there you will file a complete written report. There's a bartender here who knows where Palermo is, he's the key, now he set me up. - Superintendent when is the next flight back to Nineston? - Wilson, maybe you didn't hear me huh? 10 minutes with the bartender and I can find Palermo, now I owe that son of a bitch. - Maybe you didn't hear me, Geronimo. I have complete confidence that the superintendent will find Palermo in due time. Both he and the young lady have questioned the bartender and you're being a royal pain the ass to the Malties. I want you on the plane to Texas and that's an order, Sheriff. - I am not one of your immigration flunkies, Wilson, I do not take orders from you. - That's where you're wrong, Geronimo. You were assigned to work under my command as a courtesy from your mayor. Now if I have to call Texas to verify that to you I'll do it. As of this moment, you're on suspension, I'll take your badge. - The hell you say. - God I'm glad to get off this island. - We leave tomorrow Mr. Palermo, eh? - Yep. Our business will take to the far east. Don Lamanna sent all the details. - Teddy, can I have a beer? - Yeah, sure. - Pussycat can have mine. - No thank you, I prefer my own. - Here you go. I don't think you like me very much, hun. Maybe Gina told you something about me? Maybe she told you I was a little rough with her. - [Anna] A little. - Anyhow, Don Lamanna settled everything. He sent her to Rome for his vacation. Sort of a shocking delivery. - She's coming back tomorrow. - Is she really? - I wouldn't be surprised. She's gonna stay around a little longer. Anyhow, I'm going to the far east myself tomorrow. Would you like to come with me? - I don't think so, Gina's going to be back soon to let me run. - You like clothes huh? I can buy you beautiful furs and clothes and bikinis, anything you want. But you know, you outta be a little nicer to me. Just a little tiny bit. Can you be a little nicer to me? Just a little tiny bit, please? - If you're nice to me, Mr. Palermo, I can be really nice. - [Maria] Are you sure you're okay? - I'm fine. Well there was this nice lady, she thought she was doing me a big favor by pouring some sort of medicine down my throat. Oh thank you, pal. Appreciate it. - Just because you won't be here it's okay, I want you to know that I'll find him for you. - Well hell, probably know he's already off this island. - Oh no, I don't think. Our security and customs are very strict. - Well what if he takes a boat? - We have patrol boats around the island. - Well if you think he's still here. I've got a couple hours before my plane leaves. There's a man I want to talk to. - Now wait a minute. You're under strict orders from Superintendent Mifsud not to cause any trouble. I personally guaranteed your behavior. - I'm not gonna misbehave. I just wanna ask this bartender a few little old questions. Just sitting here, nothing to do with Palermo's shorter pick? - I told you. I swear. I just met an Italian guy who's been messing around with one of my girl. That's all. - Well I'm not convinced. I don't believe Palermo just happened to show up. - I didn't tell him! - No? I promised that little girl I'd protect her, I didn't make good on that promise and I'm getting pissed about it. - Well I don't. - Where is he? - I don't know. - Where is that bastard, huh? Where's that bastard? - Take it easy, Sheriff. I understand your frustration. Sheriff, this is not the wild west. We have laws here. You will spend the night incarcerated. And I will personally escort you to the airport tomorrow morning. - I'm sorry, I was just following orders. - Yeah I understand orders. There goes an old saying. You know you're right, go ahead on. Just right makes might. Now that bastard there knows where Palermo is and I coulda got it out of him. Can you, Maria? - Superintendent Mifsud is giving me permission to speak to the prisoner, Sheriff Geronimo. - [Guard] I'm sorry, Maria. I won't agree about it. - [Maria] I have the orders right here in my purse. Now let me see the prisoner. I'm awful nervous with this thing so don't do anything foolish, just open up the cell. Hurry up, quick, open up. - [TJ] Sorry about this pal, get in there. Anybody else around? - [Maria] No I don't think so. Here, I got your gun. - That's a good girl. Alright. - I hope this works out. 'Cause God knows I've just ruined my career. Slow down, Sheriff. If anyone sees us we must not look suspicious. - Young lady. It took a lot of guts for you to break me out of here. - Well we have a saying in Malta, like your saying in America. Only here it goes, bright is might. And I believe that getting Palermo is the right thing to do. And I wanna help get him. - Let's hope your Superintendent Mifsud agrees with ya. - I doubt it. - No need to wake the little lady. Let's have ourselves a corrective interview. Don Lamanna villa. Know where it is? - Yeah, sure, why? - Do you know where it is? - Yes it's one of the nicest houses on the island and Don Lamanna is a very respected business man from Rome. - Our friendly bartender says different. Now where's this guy live? - Well you'll never get there by yourself, I have to take you there. - Just tell me where the guy lives. - Now look, I've put my career on the line to help you get Palermo now the least you can do is let me help. - Alright. Well there's a pier leading up the backway to the villa, now if I only had a boat. - No problem. (thrilling music) Do you believe that bartender was telling the truth? - Yeah. This is the place alright. You stay here. - No way. - Don't be stupid, go back. - [Maria] I'm able to help you. - Alright, keep an ear out while I kick this door in. - [Maria] No, wait, wait. Let's try this. - [TJ] What? - [Maria] Hairpin. - [TJ] Honey I am impressed. - I've been doing this since I was a kid. - This is as far as you go. - But I've just proved that I can help you. - You don't even have a gun. The way to help is to get reinforcements with some weapons. - But I won't let you go in there alone. You'll never come out alive. - Do my best to be able to get the job done. There's nothing to worry about. Go on. Do what I told you. Go on. Be careful. (smacking) - Just finish your coffee, Palermo. - Maybe you'd like to join me, cowboy. - No thanks. I had mine in jail this evening. So we could have the news tomorrow. - So this is the American who's been causing all the trouble. I'm very impressed, the Sheriff. You seem to have more lives than a cat. You Americans... always think you know the answers. But you're always wrong. Put down the gun. (gun firing) (thrilling music) (glass shattering) (fists thudding) - Freeze! Get up. It was an accident. I didn't mean it. It was his fault. - He's mine. I owe this son of a bitch. You just do what you're told and take it all on your own. Feel like a sin cowboy? Huh? (groaning) - You sure that's still your cause, Sheriff? My brother Tony's gonna smile tonight. - All up to you. What are you looking for, bastard? - Get on the boat, cowboy. - Freeze! Don't anybody move. Saw that mess upstairs. - Wilson. - You take care of the big one. I got the little one. Let's not do anything hasty or lots of people will get hurt this way. - Palermo ain't gonna start nothing are you, you gutless son of a bitch? All Palermo does is ambush people. You're not gonna do any face to face are you, Palermo? - I have some questions and I'd like to have answers. Now that Lamanna's dead, who's gonna pay me the rest of my money? - Your money's completely safe. The family of Rome will take care of that. - I'm really sorry about this Geronimo. Nobody was suppose to get hurt. Lamanna paid me a lot of money to keep Mr. Palermo here out of Italy. I thought it would be safe using a dumb Texas sheriff like yourself. - You figured wrong. - Put the gun down, Mr. Wilson. Put your gun down. (gun firing) (screaming) - I guess I should thank you, young lady. You just saved me $250,000. You watch the cowboy, Foster. Come on then. - [Maria] Let me go! - Come on, I saved the front seat for you. (thrilling music) (gun firing) Take it easy. - Do it, throw the bastard away. - Don't be stupid, cowboy. I'll blow her brains out. Just put the gun away. - Alright, let's talk. You said something to Wilson about $250,000? - Okay. I was going to have to pay Wilson anyhow. Just give me the gun, we're gonna make a deal, huh? - You serious? - Yeah. - Alright. Putting it away. You're even dumber than I thought cowboy. You know, I can save a lot of money with one bullet. One! - And I can get rid of a scumbag like you with just one bullet. Think you can take me? Go ahead on. It's your. (gun firing) (groaning) Darling. That biggins got my badge.
