Daniel and Derek, 6 and 9 years old, upstairs, asleep in their beds. Patricia McCauley, home alone, safe, secure and completely unaware of the dangers lurking just outside that front door. Mr. McCauley, your marriage was in trouble, wasn't it? - I wouldn't say that. - What would you say? - We were seeing someone, someone to help. - And what about financial difficulties? The restaurant was in trouble. - It was a first- class restaurant in its first year. There were problems, but it was nothing that we... Patricia and I couldn't solve. - Nothing the insurance money couldn't solve. - Objection, Your Honor! - Withdrawn. Mr. McCauley... do you own a gun? - Yes. - All right... All right! Detective Lewis, were any fingerprints found at the scene of the crime? - No. - Was there any evidence of a struggle? - None that I could see, no. - Was there any witness to the murder? - None that we could find. - OK. So now, tell me, Detective, was the murder weapon recovered? - No, it was not. - And Mrs. McCauley, Detective, the body of Mrs. Patricia McCauley, you at least have that, am I right? - No. - Excuse me? - No. The body of Patricia McCauley was never recovered. - Could you explain this to me? My client is on trial for murdering his wife! You have no evidence whatsoever implicating my client at the scene of the crime, aside from the fact that he lived there, quite happily, I might add, with his family. Please, forgive me, Detective, but has anyone bothered to make sure the woman is actually dead? - Two shots. Mr. Alvarez, could you please tell us where the body of Patricia McCauley is. - East River, maybe out to sea by now. - And how do you know that? - What do you mean? That's where I dumped the... That's where I left her. - And how much were you paid to kill Patricia McCauley? - $25,000. - How did you kill her? - ... Two shots. The first one got her in the stomach... I think. Or maybe the chest. The second got her in the head. - And who hired you to kill Patricia McCauley, Mr. Alvarez? - It was him... her husband, William McCauley. - Two shots, and Patricia McCauley was dead. William McCauley paid someone, a hired killer, to end his financial troubles, to take a mother away from her children. This was not a crime of passion. This was a cold-and-calculated act of premeditated murder! William McCauley paid someone to end Patricia McCauley's life! - Madam Forewoman, in the case of The State vs. William McCauley, has the jury reached a verdict? - We have, Your Honor. - One the sole count of the indictment, murder in the second degree, how does the jury find? - We find the defendant, William McCauley... guilty. - Silence in this court! Order! Order! - I didn't kill my wife. I didn't kill my wife! - Ray! District Attorney Voss! Can you comment on the outcome of the trial? - I-- - What about the inexperience of Megan Washington? - No, State's Attorney Megan Washington is a fine prosecutor with a bright and promising future ahead of her. Now, I always said, if you can learn how to swim, you don't just wade into the water, you jump! And Miss Washington proved she's every bit as good as we expected her to be. Excuse me. - Wait! District Attorney Voss, anything else to add? - Justice was done. Excuse me. - Hello? Yeah. - Who is it? - Your wife. - Hello? Look, I'm--I'm sorry. I know how uncomfortable this must be for you. I'm the New York City district attorney, and I'm campaigning for mayor. There's something to be said about public image, you know that. It also happens to be an election year. I mean, the public doesn't wanna know their candidates have the same dysfunctional home life they do. They don't. Well, at least not until after they've elected them. Come here. I got myself a gorgeous, successful girlfriend, and I also happen to have a wife. What-- Come on. What am I supposed to do? - Get a divorce, like everyone else! Walked into that one. Look, you're right. You're right. Elizabeth is trying to be accommodating. She knows it's over. Look... Honey... After the election... Look, after the election, we'll make it Mr. and Mrs. Mayor Ray Voss. - Mr. and Mrs. Assistant District Attorney Megan Washington. - Fair enough. I have to run. Dinner tonight? - I'll see if I can pencil you in. - Hey. I love you. - You better. - Ha! Bye. Mrs. Latner's testimony? - Coming in at 4:00 to go over it. - We need to sit down with Mr. Moore this week. We got the lineup in the Lum case tomorrow. - On it. - And call Lieutenant What's-his-name over at the 2-5. - Done! Great. Um... How's everything? - Fine. Everything's fine. - No, of course everything is fine. I didn't mean that things wouldn't be fine. I mean, I just... I was just wondering, you know... Just wondering about Mr. Right. - Who? - The guy you're seeing! The one who you're deliberately avoiding telling me about, even though you obviously want to spill every single detail to me even as we speak. - Right! That Mr. Right! Well, to tell you the truth, he's starting to look a lot like Mr. Wrong. - ... Is he smart? - Brilliant. - Funny? Successful? - Yes and yes. - Is he good in... at... you know? - Lucy! Yes, he is. - So what the hell could be wrong with him? - He's married. - So is he a little bit married or a lot married? - No one's a little bit married, Lucy. Either you're married or you're not. Case closed. No one is a little bit pregnant, and no one is a little bit dead. And in the case of dating, no one, and I repeat, no one, is a little bit married. What? - I was just wondering if you love him. - You were just wondering if I love him. - So? - A little bit. - I think you better take a look at this. - Thank you. My God! Police say they were tearing up an apartment complex on Lexington, and lo and behold, Patricia McCauley's body shows up. - This is... You know how bad this is? This--this is definitely not good. - Maybe we were overreacting. I mean, we had a strong case. We didn't necessarily need Alvarez's testimony to-- - Whoa, overreacting? We convicted William McCauley on the pretty much uncorroborated testimony of a confessed killer who seems to have perjured himself in doing so! The guy says he left the body in one place, we find it somewhere else! What, am I missing something? I'm sorry, did he just forget? Should I just explain to the judge: "I'm sorry, Your Honor. "If there's one thing you can't trust about a hired killer, "it's his pesky memory." Am I overreacting now? All right, what about Alvarez? Where is he now? - That's the other problem. - Problem? - We're not sure. - You're not sure. - His paperwork was lost while he was being transferred. - So you're saying you have absolutely no idea whatsoever where the key witness in your case is? - None whatsoever. - Great. That's great. - All right. So what do we do? - This is going to hit the fan on this one. I mean, state's attorney promoted to assistant DA after getting a conviction on a big case, district attorney running for mayor... This is... This is gonna explode! - So what do we do? - We get ready. Let McCauley and his lawyers make the first move. But be ready to act instead of react, or William McCauley is going to walk out of jail a free man, and then we're both done. Man, this is gonna hurt. - Ray, I-- - Look, it's... It's not all you, I know. But this is damage control now. We're gonna have to be careful. We're gonna have to play this one close to the vest. - Meaning? - Well, meaning... we're gonna have to keep this as hush-hush as humanly possible. We're gonna have to be very, very quiet. - OK. Mr. McCauley! - Mr. McCauley, just a few questions over here. - Please. Please, one question at a time. - Does this mean that Luis Alvarez lied about being contracted by you to kill your wife? - I think we all know the answer to that. What it means, that's for the court to decide. - And what are your plans now? - I'm getting my own reality series. - Will you be defending your client in another trial, or do you expect your client to be acquitted of all charges? - The court makes that decision. Whatever the case, Mr. McCauley will soon walk out of that courtroom a free man. Now, how soon that is, how quickly the state decides to correct this egregious error, well, that's up to them. - How does it feel? - My God, is this guy for real? How the hell do you think it feels? - Mr. McCauley is happy to be safe and well. He's happy to see his children again. And he's happy to finally find vindication in the truth that he is an innocent man. That is enough. - Are you saying you have no plans to seek retribution should he be cleared of all charges? - This man just spent the last 8 years of his life incarcerated for a crime he didn't commit. What would you think? Yeah. - Just a few more questions! - No! That's it. Thank you very much. - Just a few more questions! - Mr. McCauley! - All right. Let's proceed with the hearing. - Well, first of all, Your Honor, I'd like to renew my objection to the court's decision not to dismiss the charges against my client. Furthermore-- - Save it for later. You got yourself a new trial, and I'm sure there'll be plenty of opportunity for you to renew all the objections you'd like there, maybe come up with a few new ones. - Yes, Your Honor. - How does your client plead? - My-- - Not guilty. I'm not guilty, Your Honor. - We'll see, Mr. McCauley. Bail? - Your Honor, the state feels that it would be in everyone's best interest if Mr. McCauley remained in our custody during the trial. - Everyone's interest but my client's. William McCauley has already served 8 years. - Because he is a convicted killer. - Which was the result of malicious prosecution and has been overturned. - Children, please! You want to fight, you do it outside in the schoolyard. This is my house here, and what I say goes. Bail is set at $250,000. I'll see you all at the trial. But, Your Honor... - Your Honor, Mr. McCauley is a convicted murderer. - Not anymore, he isn't. - Mr. McCauley has 2 children that he'd like to visit. He's got a life that he'd like to restart. He's not a flight risk. $250,000-- - Pay it! - William, I-- - Pay it. I've spent the last 8 years caged up in a hole. I want out now. Pay the damn money. - Well, someone in this courtroom has finally said something sensible. Bail is set at $250,000. I'll see you all later. He's out. - I heard. - And still no luck tracking down Luis. It seems the entire prison system has misplaced our infamous Mr. Alvarez. - Doesn't matter. Forget him. His testimony is useless anyway. - Don't you wanna know why he lied in the first place? - Nope. Won't change anything now. - Maybe not, but if I could get him on the stand-- - You already made that mistake once, and look where it got us. - Excuse me? Don't you put this on me now. - I'm not. I'm sorry. It's just... - Ray, we're all exhausted here. We're all feeling the heat. But I have as much at stake in this case as you do. - I know. I know. Honey... I... Come here. Look... We need to get back to where we were. - This isn't about us, Ray. This is about McCauley getting away with murder. - You're right. That's why I need you to nail this one... to put McCauley back behind bars. I need to know you can get that done. Come here. I have to go. - What? Where? - The press. - Giving a statement in the McCauley case? - Well, someone has to. - We don't have anything to say. - They're reporters, honey. I'm sure they'll make something up. - I'm sorry I'm late! Sorry! - No problem! - Hey! What is it? - It's been 8 years. I was just thinking... ...I need to walk through this case again, maybe visit the crime scene, McCauley's house. - It was in Patricia's name. Her family sold it years ago. But the restaurant hasn't been touched. - What? - It was in McCauley's name, held in trust. - Wait a minute. Here's the address. - Call me if you need me. But there won't be anyone who could let you in at this time of night. I'll get on it tomorrow morning. - See you tomorrow, Lucy. - Goodnight. - What the hell am I doing? OK... OK, here goes nothing. What the hell? OK, you can do this. Of course. Here we go. What the hell am I doing? Hello? Come on. There has to be something. Aha! My God! This is a lot of money. Come on, Meg. Who's there? This is state's property, and you're trespassing! You can leave... but leave now! Go on! Great! OK... OK, Meg, come on. Hello? Is anybody out there? Somebody! Anybody! Get me the hell out of here! Hello? Who the hell are you, and what the hell were you doing at a boarded-up restaurant in the middle of the night? - I was following you. Look, my name's Casey Gordon, OK? I work for the Times. What were you looking for in there anyway? Did you find anything? Why were you locked in a freezer? - You're a reporter? - Sort of. - Well, then I definitely don't want to talk to you. - OK... Wait, wait, wait. OK, look, I'm not really a reporter, OK? I'm a photographer. But I just... But I was just hoping, maybe with this case, you know, if I could bring my editor something, a real story... - Good luck with that. - Look, I just thought maybe we could help each other out, OK? I could do some investigating for you, and you could help me put the pieces together. - I do my own investigating, thank you very much. - Yeah, as you've clearly proven tonight. - Excuse me? - I'm just saying... Look, I really need this story, OK? - There is no story here, Mr. Gordon. - Well, I beg to differ, Miss Washington. - Taxi! Look, there is no story here, Casey. Best of luck to you. Hey, for what it's worth, thanks for letting me out of the freezer. - You're welcome. - Come! So nice of you to join us, counselor. - I apologize, Your Honor. I had an accident yesterday and-- - That's OK. I get paid by the hour. - We're all very impressed, Miss Russert. - Thank you, Your Honor. - So what can I do for the two of you? I assume this isn't a social call, because the truth of the matter is, I don't like either one of you. God only knows what you think of me. Heh! Tea, anyone? - No, thank you. We're here about the Alvarez testimony. - That! It's out. - What? - Out, all of it. - Why? - Well, the man perjured himself. Now, that may not mean much to a couple of lawyers, but I won't have his testimony repeated in my courtroom. - Thank you, Your Honor. - Not so fast. Mr. Alvarez's testimony from the first trial may be out, but I've decided the people have the right to hear what he has to say. He'll get a chance to testify at the second trial, provided he can get his story straight, Miss Washington. - Thank you, Your Honor. - But, Your Honor-- A butt is only good for sitting on, Miss Russert. Now, what I say, goes, so I'll kindly ask you and your colleague to remove yours before my tea gets cold. - Thank you, Your Honor. - Thank you, Your Honor. - Pleasure was all mine. - Well, I think that went rather well, don't you? - For the record, I think that you're a mediocre lawyer who's accomplished far less than you give yourself credit for, Christina. But don't worry, we still have a whole trial to go through. You'll have plenty of time to show us your dog-and-pony show. - Meg! You're not taking this personally, are you? - I'll see you at the trial. - Or the hearing. - What hearing? - You know, I'm sorry, I forgot about this. There you go. - "It having been stated... Statute... "Prejudice, negligence and malicious prosecution... "The plaintiff, William McCauley..." He's suing me? - And the state's attorney's office. $50 mill. You know, I think that's a fair and reasonable request, don't you? Obviously, my client is taking this personally, counselor, and I can't say that I blame him. - Megan Washington's office. - Lucy! Lu, tell me you have something for me. - A Casey Gordon keeps calling for you. He sounds sweet. - Stay focused here, Lu. About the case, tell me you have something about the case. - Nothing. - We've got nothing? - They found nothing. - You call the cops, like I asked? - Yeah. They tore the restaurant apart this morning, top to bottom. - And? - And, like I said, nothing. - No money? - Nada. - But there had to have been half a million dollars there last night. I saw it! - It gets worse. - Lucy, my key witness has vanished off the face of the earth. Any clues I seem to come up with disappear just as easily, OK? Yeah, and along with the state's attorney's office, I am personally being sued for $50 million. So please tell me, Lu, how does it possibly get worse? - Voss wants to see you in his office. Now. - Beautiful. - Got the papers this morning. - $50 million. - It'll never get that far. - I think you better take this seriously, Ray. - I take everything seriously. That's why I'm... - What? - I want you to bury it, Meg. - No. No. - Drop it, the whole thing. - No, you can't just... No! - Next... Listen, listen. Next Monday, the state's attorney's office is gonna put an offer on the table. Time served if he drops the lawsuit. Everything under wraps. - You mean under the rug. I won't do it! - Meg... - I won't offer a convicted killer a free ride because the state's afraid, because it'll stay out of the papers, because it'll make things easier. I won't offer William McCauley a pass because it's an election year, Ray. - I don't think you grasp how much is at stake here. - Ask Patricia McCauley's children what's at stake. - Come on! - No, Ray, I am not going to put this man back on the street to save face for you and the office! - Damn it, Meg! - What? - Look... We are all friends here, OK? - I don't think I'm your friend here, Ray. And I am certain I'm not your damn scapegoat. So you and your reputation can go to hell, because I'm not putting any offer on any table for William McCauley. - I'm not asking. - Well, I won't do it. - Megan! You were off this case when this landed on my desk 20 minutes ago. I was just trying to give you a second chance. - You're pathetic. - Hey! - Hey. - That kind of day? - To say the least. - You know, you weren't returning my phone calls, so I figured I'd just drop by and see if you were in your office. - I'm not even sure if I have an office anymore. - Well, then how about we go back to mine? - Excuse me? - Come on. Trust me. Casey, how old are you? - Twenty-eight. - Young. - I'd say eager to learn. - An idealist. - Now, are we talking about me, or are we talking about you? - ... Touché. - So the case isn't going well? - A fight in court, I can handle. But all the rest... The lawsuit now, my boss, photographers following me around. - All right, well, yeah, that--that's a lot to handle. But maybe I can help you out. - Talking to a reporter is not going to help me. - All right. Well, what about just talking to me as a person? I mean, come on, you're frustrated. You're upset. So tell me. - Tell you what? - What you want. I mean, what would you like to do right this minute? What would--what would make it all better? - Another drink. You're serious. - Yeah. - OK! Well, I would like to walk up to William McCauley right now and punch him in the nose for ruining my life. - Wow! The Coltman Hotel. Room 1145. - What's that? - That is where McCauley is staying now that he's out. - And how do you know that? - It's my job to know it. - Well, aren't you the clever little cub reporter. - That's me. Cheers! - Cheers! Unbelievable! "Dear Megan... "I'm sorry for the way I've been acting lately. "We can't allow our careers to come between us, right? "What we had... "I'm sorry, we need to talk... "...something I need to say to you." Blah, blah, blah... "So sorry, Ray." Thanks for nothing. ♪ Dance music Is Mr. Lewis in? - Up the stairs. - Thank you. - We're not hiring! - It's funny you should say that. I seem to have suddenly found myself looking for a change of vocation. - Guess I shouldn't be surprised seeing you. - Hello to you, too. Still spending most of your day sitting on your butt, staring at young skirts, I see. Six years from retirement. No one told you you had to leave, you know. - I was fine with the protecting part. It was the "to serve" that seemed to wear me a little thin, if you know what I mean. - So this place all yours then? - Mine and the bank's. Most guys, when they, they retire, they go into the private-eye business or security guards at Quickie Mart or something. Me, I made an investment. - May I? - Please. - Detective Lewis... Patricia McCauley. I need to know everything. - I told you everything 8 years ago. - And you know that I know that a cop never tells the DA's office everything. - Miss Washington, the wheels of justice would grind to a screeching halt in no time flat if a cop were to tell you everything. That's the way things work. Besides, you don't want to know everything. - This time, I do. And you're not a cop anymore. - True enough. - So tell me how it is that an unsuccessful restaurant owner with the bank breathing down his neck could have $500,000 squirreled away in a duffel bag hidden in the wall of his office. - What do you know about the restaurant business in this city? - Nothing. - All right. What do you know about Ivan Guergerin? - The Russian mobster? My office has 2 dozen open cases linking his name to everything from prostitution to drugs, and murder. - Bingo! Very big, and very, very bad. His finger's in a whole lot of pies, including... - Let me guess, the restaurant business. - Protection, investment capital, whatever. The bank's about to foreclose on all your hard work and dreams, and there's Ivan Guergerin with an all-purpose loan just waiting for you, as long as you're willing to pay. - Why didn't you say anything 8 years ago? - For whose benefit? Yours? The defence? You guys had a suspect. You had a motive. Who was I to rain on your parade by telling you that the victim's husband borrowed heavily from the mob and couldn't pay him back? - The money was borrowed from Guergerin? - I don't know. - Was it the money to pay him back? - I don't know. - Lewis, give me something I can work with here! - Listen. The defendant borrowing money from the Russian mob isn't as important as the fact that Ivan Guergerin also employed the services of another man William McCauley would find himself in need of. - You mean... - Your shooter. - Luis Alvarez worked for Guergerin and the Russian mob. ♪♪ Looking back on you right now ♪ ♪ I see there's nothing left ♪ ♪ I can't feel the pain ♪ When I see you sleep inside ♪ ♪ I can't feel the pain ♪ When I see you sleep inside... ♪ Come on, Lucy! - Hello? -Lucy! - Meg?

But we're not having this conversation? - Right. - Just making sure. - Look, this is a private office! What do you want?

Now I'm not sure of anything. I wanna know something. I'm curious. - Yeah, shoot. - Why didn't you run the story when you found me at the restaurant? - Why? - Yeah. - 'Cause a story about finding the assistant DA locked in a freezer isn't the kind of journalism I'm interested in. - I don't know. Sounds like a story with legs, if you ask me. - Maybe, but I'm interested in the bigger picture. - And what's that? - I wanna know why you were there in the first place. OK, I wanna know why your boss removed you from the case. And I wanna know why Alex Lewis was shot to death last night. - What? - In his club, last night. You didn't hear? - No. - Barmaid found him.

What kind of resources do you have at the paper? - I don't know. I mean, I can call in a few favours. Why? - Nothing on the record. - What do you need? - I need you to get me everything you can on Ivan Guergerin. - Ivan Guergerin? That is... That is a very dangerous man. - I need you to get me everything that you can on him.

I've been looking into the case, into McCauley's background, into the restaurants, into his ties with Ivan Guergerin. There's more here than-- - I know. - You know? - I knew about it all 8 years ago. So did the DA. - Ray Voss? - He didn't tell you? He argued it right out of the trial. - But it connects McCauley to the killer. Why would-- - Because it would give the defence a mighty fine alternative theory as to who else might have killed Patricia McCauley, one that makes a hell of a lot more sense, if you ask me. - I'm not following. - Think about it, Megan. If William McCauley did borrow money from a mobster like Guergerin to keep his restaurant in business, he would not need to kill his wife for the insurance money. No. A man with a family borrows money from a shark like that, seems to me the only person who would have an interest in killing Patricia McCauley would be someone intent on sending a message: pay, or else. - You mean Guergerin himself. But if you believe that, that William is innocent, then why did you throw it out all those years ago? Why did you let Voss' motion stand? - What I believe has absolutely no bearing on how I conduct a court of law, Megan. The decision was never mine to begin with. The DA went over my head on that one. - Over your head? - Your Ray Voss, he's got ties way up on high, that boy does. - But why wouldn't he tell me all this before I tried the case? Why wouldn't he tell me now? - I don't know. But I will tell you one thing. The honest-to-God truth is, Megan, I believe the man is innocent. And having said that, Assistant District Attorney Megan Washington, I gotta go. I'm late. Do me a favor. You take care of yourself, girl. - I will. You too. - Follow the light. - Meg! - Good. - Jeez, I came as soon as I heard. What the hell happened? - Judge Randfield. Gerry's dead. - You almost got yourself killed! First the restaurant, now this. - Wait a minute. You knew about the restaurant? - You called the police. Of course I knew about it! Damn it! You have to understand. McCauley, the restaurant, Detective Lewis, Judge Randfield... I mean, this bomb, was probably meant for the both of you! - Ray... - You... You know it's only 'cause I care. It is over, Megan. Walk away from this while you still can. - No. Listen, what if we were wrong? What-- Listen to me! What if McCauley really is innocent? - What? Are you out of your damn... You're kidding me, right? You're... - I don't know. What if he is? - Come here. Do you have any proof? Anything? - No. I'm not even sure. Look, Ray, I don't know. - Let me take you to the hospital. - No. - Well, at least let me take you home. Come tomorrow, hopefully, this nightmare will all be over and we can get back to our lives... together. McCauley will be in jail later tonight, and in a couple of weeks-- - Wait a minute. McCauley will be in jail? - I issued a warrant for his arrest for murder and attempted murder. He's not going to hurt anyone again. - You're arresting McCauley? - Yeah. - Two days ago, you were willing to let the man walk. - You were ready to see him fry. - I was wrong. - No, I was wrong. And I'm sorry. I promise you-- - No. No promises. Not from you. Now, I'm going home... alone. - What about the hospital? We should get you checked out. - Excuse me? Can I go home? - Yeah, it's just a bump. Take it easy. You'll be fine. - Thank you. Goodbye, Ray. - Come on. Megan, at least let me take you home. - Hey! - Hi! - Hi. I saw it on the news. Are you OK? - Yeah. Dizzy. - Can I come up? - Yeah, you bet. - The police are unwilling to comment on the possible connection between the murder of Judge Gerald Randfield and that of NYPD detective Alex Lewis. - Well, look, if you'd stop moving! Come on. - Like it's all somehow my fault. - I never should have let you out of the freezer. - Look, I'm sorry. It's just been one of those days, you know? - Yeah. Look, I'm sorry. Look, do you... Do you want me to go? - No, stay. Look, I'm--I'm sorry. I just... I want you to stay. Thank you for being there for me. - I'm glad I could be here for you. ♪♪ All I want is to be around you... ♪ - What? - This thing is dangerous! ♪ All my thoughts are spinning inside... ♪ - Sorry.

Time served. Is that really the best you can do, counselor? - William, I need to ask you some questions. - Where the hell am I going to go? - Tell me about Ivan Guergerin. - No, and this meeting is over. Guard! - William! I know about the $500,000. I know he was trying to help you get the restaurant out of the hole. I know you didn't use the money by the time Patricia was killed. - You know. You know. What the hell do you know? You know, the only thing more painful than wasting 8 years of your life in prison watching your kids grow up without you, is watching you idiots in the DA's office try to figure things out! - Guergerin killed Patricia. Guergerin had Alvarez kill Patricia because you didn't pay the money back to send you a message. - I did not borrow the money from Guergerin. OK, Patricia was not killed to send me a message. - Come on, William. Where did the money come from then? - I told her. Damn it! I told her... I told her that we can get out of this, that we can turn it around ourselves, that every business takes a beating in the first 5 years... But she just wouldn't listen. - Patricia borrowed the money from Guergerin. - I begged her to listen. - Why didn't you pay it back? - I never even saw a cent of that money, neither did the restaurant. Patricia told me that she changed her mind, that she didn't do it. And I guess I wanted to believe her. But then when Guergerin's men started coming around, then... - William, why didn't you say something 8 years ago? - Listen. I have 2 kids, all right? - OK, so tell me this then. Judge Randfield, Detective Lewis, why would Guergerin want them dead? - I don't know, to incriminate me, to get them out of the way. How the hell should I know? I'm not even sure that Guergerin is doing the killing. - Then who? - Who? Well, I don't know, counselor. Why don't you ask yourself, who stands to benefit most from their deaths? - Look, William, you are not safe, either. I need to get you out of here. - Well, thanks, but no thanks. You know, I post bail in 20 minutes. If you really want to help me and my family, just stay the hell away from us. Thank you for supporting me. - Ray. - Meg! Gentlemen, this is Assistant District Attorney Megan Washington. - Yeah, hi. Ray, we need to speak. - I--- Now. - Megan, I'm kind of meeting with some campaign investors here. How about tomorrow we-- Excuse us, gentlemen. Yes. - We really need to talk. Oops! - It's OK. It's OK. Excuse me. Megan, this... This is going too far. - William McCauley is innocent. - That's just the concussion talking. - I'm sure of it. - How can you be sure? - Because he told me. I'm saying we were wrong-- wrong 8 years ago and wrong now. I think I know who killed Patricia McCauley. Say something. - You're fired. - So what do you take in your coffee? - Whiskey. Lots and lots of whiskey. - Sorry? - I said sugar. Lots and lots of sugar. - Yeah, right. - Why the hell does he have a file on me? - So he just fired you? - What? Sorry? - I asked if Voss... Never mind. What are you going to do now? -Who stands to benefit the most from their deaths, counselor? - Who stands to benefit... - Guergerin, Ivan? That is a very dangerous man. One minute, you're packing up the family into the minivan, and the next, boom! Dangerous. What'd you say? - What? - What? - Nothing. I was just thinking about something Mr. McCauley asked me earlier today. - Yeah? What's that? - You know what? I gotta go! - Meg, what's wrong? - Nothing. I just forgot to do something earlier today. I'll call you later. Guergerin... Borrowed $500,000... Patricia, Guergerin, McCauley... - Meg, you still there? - Yeah. Did you get it? - Yeah. The file says it's the Russian Social Center in Little Odessa. Just be smart. - I will. Mr. Guergerin, thank you for seeing me. I'm Meg-- - Sit down, please. I know who you are. Now you tell me why should I care. - Simple. The district attorney's office is quite capable of-- - District attorney, attorney general... You want to speak to me? You get in line behind the FBI. - I'm not here to threaten you, Mr. Guergerin. - Then what is it that you want? - I want to help. - And how can you help me? - Well, as assistant district attorney-- - You are not assistant district attorney. This, I already know. So you can't help me. But you think that maybe I can help you, yes? - I just want to know if Luis Alvarez ever worked for you. Did he? - Leave, both of you! Luis... He's good worker. Strong. - Did he ever kill for you? - I am a legitimate businessman. - Well! Tell me, did you ever loan money, as a legitimate businessman, did you ever loan money to William or Patricia McCauley? - No. - Did you ever help William or Patricia McCauley, do them a favor? - I do many favors for friends. - And were they friends? - Could be. It's so hard to remember. You see, in my business, I've made so many. - This is completely off the record here, just 2 people chatting, nothing more. I just need you to... tell me, please... if William or Patricia McCauley ever-- - Your boss, Voss... he's a friend. Or, at least, he was. - What? - Mr. Soon-to-be-Mayor. He'd not be district attorney if not for his friends, friends like me. He would not be nobody. - Wait a minute. Are you admitting that you helped influence the political career of a public official? - I'm not admitting anything. Just... chatting. - I don't understand. What are you getting at with Voss? - What if I was to say to you that I knew Voss and McCauley woman? And what if I was to tell you... that maybe they knew each other? Nastrovia. - Nastrovia. Voss knows. You know. You both know who really killed Patricia McCauley. - There are many things I know, like McCauley was hard worker but a bad businessman, that killers sometimes get away with murder, and that maybe your high-and-mighty boss, he knows this, too. But in my business, Miss Washington, do you know the most important thing I've learned? - What? - It's that knowing too much can be very, very dangerous. That's something this McCauley woman, she found out, too. - So let me get this straight. You're saying that Ray Voss knows who really killed Patricia McCauley, has always known. Why are you telling me this? What's in it for you? - That's easy. I helped Voss. I helped make him what he is today. And now he says he squeeze my business to look good on TV for votes! Voss screws me. Voss screws you. There's old Russian saying: Enemies of my enemies are my friends, yes? - And why should I believe you? - Believe, no believe. That's up to you, Miss Washington. - Casey, I'm sorry about earlier. I don't know what I was thinking, but it's not important. I have to find Ray. - Meg, OK-- - I know McCauley is innocent. I'm sure of it. And I think Ray knows who killed Patricia. - Meg, listen to me, OK? I found him. I found Alvarez. - Where is he? Luis? Luis, my name is Megan Washington. - I know who you are. You're.... You're Voss' kid. - You remember Ray Voss? - I've spent 8 years of my life remembering Ray Voss. Why not remember him while I die, too? - Luis, it's very important that you tell me everything. - No, it's not. It's not important. I have stomach cancer. That's what's important to me. Ray Voss told me I would spend 4 years behind bars... not a day more. They let me out 4 years later because... they knew it was over. - Voss promised you 4 years for your testimony? - And enough cash to make it worth my while. - What? - It's been sitting in a bank for 8 years while I sat in my cell and wasted away... ...while I sit here now and wither away! - Voss... paid you for your testimony? - Not that I've ever seen a dime. Not that I ever will. - Why did you lie about disposing of the body in the river? - I didn't know it was a lie. I had no idea where they put the body. - Luis, I need you to tell me-- - She knew my boss, Guergerin, that McCauley woman. She... She borrowed money from him. She saw Voss with Guergerin, put 2 and 2 together, you know, smart girl. She went to your boss to try to get something to keep her mouth shut. Not so smart after all. - Voss dealt you on the murder charge, gave you the money... My God! Ray Voss hired you to kill Patricia McCauley. - Paid to say I did it. Paid with the last 8 years. Paying with my life! Two shots. The first one got her in the stomach, maybe the chest. Second one got her in the head. God help me, Your Honor! I killed Patricia McCauley! It ain't the truth neither. - Luis... this is your last chance to make it right. Please tell me who really killed Patricia McCauley. - Ray Voss. - Pick up, pick up, pick up! Come on! Damn it, Casey, pick up the phone! Answer the phone! Come on! - Hey, it's Casey. Leave me a message at the sound of the beep. - Casey! Casey, it's Meg! Listen, I just talked to Alvarez. He told me everything. We need to meet. Meet me where they found Patricia McCauley's body. Meet me there in a half an hour. Casey, and whatever you do, stay away from Ray Voss. - Message erased. - Come on, Casey, where are you? - Hello, Meg. I got your message. - Ray... Where's Casey? - I am so very sorry. Please don't be afraid. You have to understand how sorry I am. You weren't supposed to find out, not this way. - Ray... - I couldn't let her do it. Patricia McCauley was going to ruin me. She was going to tell the papers about my relationship with Guergerin, the whole thing. I would have lost it all, everything I have worked so hard for. Everything! I had to get rid of her. - And Detective Lewis? Judge Randfield? What about me, Ray? Am I next? - What? You think... I didn't kill them. I couldn't hurt them. I couldn't hurt you. Never. I came here... to ask you to forgive me, because I can't keep it together anymore. I can't keep it in. I just want it to end. - Ray... Ray, don't. - I'm sorry... - Don't, please... Ray! God! - Can you believe this son of a bitch killed my wife? And then pinned the murder on me. Do not touch the gun! Get up. Listen, I hope I'm not interrupting anything. I just thought that you and I should discuss my case. What do you think of that? - William, what are you doing here? - What, right now? Just having some fun, counselor. Ooh, Mr. Voss, you do not look well. So close! You know, that's one thing I'll give you, Mr. Voss: your unwillingness to accept defeat. Now, you sit tight, Mr. District Attorney. I'll be right back. Why, sure, counselor, I've always enjoyed a good game of hide and seek! Ready or not... here I come! Hey, counselor! Do you know? Do you have any idea what it does to a man to spend 8 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit? I'll tell you one thing! It really gets on your nerves! Counselor, I could go on for hours and hours about the inhumanity, the indignation... the hatred... The hatred! If you only knew, counselor, how many hundreds of thousands of hours, minutes, seconds I have spent planning, plotting, hating... Lewis... Randfield... Voss... Let me tell you something, counselor. Killing is easy! You know, when you think about it, my story is one of triumph, really! - That's great! Maybe we can get you a book deal! - No more deals, counselor. No. No, no, no. Tonight, you die. And tomorrow, your little newspaper friend can write a quaint column exposing the heinous crimes of District Attorney Voss. And I get to go back to normal life, one $50-million lawsuit richer, that is. And everybody wins! Except you. It kind of sucks for you. Now, don't get me wrong, counselor. I enjoyed killing Detective Lewis. But the judge... The judge, I thought for sure that bomb was gonna take the both of you out. But I'm happy it didn't, because now that means that I get to legitimately kill you with my own 2 hands. Maybe you haven't noticed, but I have few anger issues to work through. Let's do that together, shall we? Do you know what the very best part of this is, counselor? I had you on my side in the end. Yeah! I actually had you believing in me! Damn, I'm good! - Not that good! - OK, come on, counselor, put the gun... Just calm down, counselor. Come on. I got 2 kids, for God's sake. You're an officer of the court. You're not gonna shoot me. Besides, I'm a nice guy. You're not gonna shoot me. - I was fired, and you're a bastard. - Yeah, well, 1 out of 3 ain't bad, right? - Come on! - Safety first, counselor. We're gonna make this a fair fight. What's the matter, counselor? Are you giving up already? No, we're just getting started! I wanted so badly to do this the other day at the restaurant. But I said to myself, her time will come. Just be patient, William, because it just goes to show that there's a new surprise in store for you each day? - You got that right! - Please... No... I'm sorry... OK, I... I don't know what I was thinking. I don't... I need help! - It's over, William! - Look, I know you're not bluffing. I know that you'd shoot me. Come on, counselor. God! We can figure this out in court, all right? I can give myself up, counselor. Come on. Aren't you even a little bit curious to know what I plan to say in my own defence? - Sorry, Bill. Verdict's in. - Yeah, the crime scene's been locked up, but the EMTs are gonna be here for another little while. - Hey. - Hey. - You OK? - Yeah. I will be. - So what's gonna happen to Voss? - He'll stand trial, go to jail. - And what are you gonna do? - Guess I'll have to get a new job. - Come on, let's get you out of here. - Yeah. - Hey, well, you know, I think you got a pretty good nose for snooping there. Ever considered being a reporter? - ... I don't think so. - Why not? - Too dangerous a vocation. - Take me home. - You got it.
