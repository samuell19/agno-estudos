[English subtitles are available] The Millennial Udumbara, the Sacred Object of the Sect of Poison, has appeared in Ghost Valley. Who knows how many brave heroes have come to vie for it. This sea of clouds over Ghost Valley does live up to its name. Yes. Even with a magic paint brush that brings everything to life you couldn't draw such a breathtaking scenery. Watching such magnificent clouds on a sky-vessel, I think the clouds of Mount Wushan can't compare to this at all. It is rare to see you, the knowledgeable leader of , to be surprised. Oh, if it my senior brother wasn't seriously ill, I wouldn't come to Ghost Valley to seek the Millennial Udumbara. Ling Er congratulates Master Peng on obtaining the Golden Pill of Traversing Adversity for 500 gold. When is Gu Qi Shao going to be here? Everyone is waiting for the Millennial Udumbara. When will he be here? The Valley Master has made his arrangements. Look at the time! What comes next enjoys equal popularity with the Tian Xin Powder, the Golden Pill of Traversing Adversity, and the Nine Flowers Amber Bracelet. It's the master of all poison, the Millennial Udumbara. So that is the Millennial Udumbara? Wow! It can cure thousand kinds of poison and prolong your life by 100 years. And it has the ability to renew youth. I bid a thousand gold! I bid ten thousand! This eyeball of mine is made from a fallen meteorite! No one can vie with me! Is your eye worth half of our Mount Huashan? That's right! Go away! Excuse me, do you have our Master's invitation? Valley Master Qi Shao took away my Lady's Udumbara. I'm here to find some nutriments for her. Get out! This is no place for you! Go away! We've got no nutriments! You are all going to die. I don't mind if you make a little fuss. Stop playing tricks! You're asking for your own death! The Millennial Udumbara! Catch him! Needle Storm! [Poison Valley Bride] Why did you kill my Purple Bees? You're the admirable Princess Consort of Qin. How could you play with these poisonous insects inside the mansion? Could it be that you're plotting my murder? Only the vicious Sect of Insect practice poisonous sorcery. Also, my Purple Bees aren't poisonous at all! Before I figure out who you really are, you had better know your place. Or else... Help! Something happened to Young Master Tang! Young Master Tang! Young Master Tang! Quickly! Take him inside. Since you're an expert in poisons, don't make any mistakes! Danger! From now on, the whole mansion is in lockdown! Come on! Hurry up! Close the doors! Han Yun Xi! Be quick! Thankfully, the poisonous insect hasn't reached his heart yet. Or else, I wouldn't be able to save you. Don't think that you are cleared of all suspicion just because you cured my brother. Is it so hard for you to say thank you, King of Qin? Don't let Han Yun Xi know that you went to Ghost Valley. Princess Consort. To my surprise, only in a short time, she knocked all the people there off their feet! What a scene! It was a total chaos! I took a look at her and found that she didn't come with good intention. Then, I collected myself and yelled "Needle Storm"! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Take a guess, what happened then. I hit her right in the chest! And then she turned into so many bugs! They were black. This b... Well, this big. They ran really fast! What happened to Gu Qi Shao? Sister Princess Consort. Don't you know how to knock? You don't need to worry about Gu Qi Shao. He wasn't at the tavern last night. I'll go see for myself. Look at that impudent girl, she has no manners! And she's concerned about other men! If you ask me, you should divorce her now since you haven't performed the wedding ceremony yet. So what if the empress dowager gifted this marriage? Hey, hey, hey! Look! She took your horse! That's your horse. My horse? Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Whoa! Are you still not letting go? Even the deers outside Ghost Valley were poisoned by the insects. The situation inside the valley must be terrible. Why are all the aerial tramways for the sky-vessel broken? It's Heaven's will! Qi Shao must be self-quarantining to stop the poison. He destroyed the sky-vessel himself to cut off the roads to Ghost Valley. Yun-vessel? Which "Yun"? In that case, let's return to the mansion with His Highness. It's also what Gu Qi Shao wants. He must have forgotten this. Wow! So beautiful. This is Qi Shao's Five-Colored Bird. I imitated the sound of his flute. With this bird, we won't get lost in this sea of clouds. I used to get the medicine by drifting through the sky, I never knew that we can go there by ship. It's so new to me! There's poison, Your Highness! Are you alright? Luckily, the poison didn't penetrate the skin. It's not serious. This sea of clouds is the natural barrier of Ghost Valley. All life in it are very ferocious and highly poisonous. It's very dangerous to take a ship. That's why we use the sky-vessel. Your mother left you this? This is the the Sacred Object of the Sect of Poison. But I didn't take good care of it. Nothing is perfect in this world. The classic of poison being damaged is something meant to be. Hearing you say so, I feel much better now. Qi Shao is my close friend. Ghost Valley needs help now. I'm sorry for asking you to venture into danger with me. It's fine. Time to go. Come on. Wait for me! Looks like she not only killed the people who came for the herbs, but also the storehouse workers. These people's spirits are not yet dispersed, their blood not yet disturbed. They can still be saved. But the poisonous insects have reached their hearts, I can't get them out. I don't know how much longer they can survive. This is too scary. If I hadn't escaped bravely, I'd have turned out just like them! I once heard about a Madam Tian Can who developed a type of mysterious poisonous insect. This kind of insect reaches one's heart through the meridians, cocoons itself, feeds by sucking one's essence and blood, breaks out of the cocoon as a moth, and then flies back to its host. However, this legend is over 100 years old. It's quite dubious. Are all of you okay? Judging by their appearance, it seems that they are poisoned. Watch out! That old chaperon at the tavern turned into these things too! These insects are similar to Marionette Mites. They can turn into many things. They can form into humans and dissipate. What about the people at the tavern? Were they also...? The tavern? Let's go! [Ghost Valley Tavern] They are all masters from all corners of the country. This truly was a calamity of the martial arts world. Use this. Your Highness! I risked my life to obtain this to remove poison for you! Then you won't have to worry about Empress Dowager threatening you with poison again. They need this more than me. This Millennial Udumbara can be used to make pills, powder and ointments. Its flagrance alone can remove poison. King of Qin and everyone else can all share it. It's a fake. No way. This thing almost cost me my life! The scent of the Millennial Udumbara is refreshing, but this one is odorless. It just looks the same. That liar! Gu Qi Shao was selling fake items? If I see him, I'm gonna rip off his handsome face! The real Millennial Udumbara should still be in Qi Shao's hands. Perhaps, this was all just a trick of Gu Qi Shao. Impossible. I know what kind of person Qi Shao is. Enough. No matter what, we need to find him first. But Gu Qi Shao always does things in a weird way. How do we find him? Sister Princess Consort. Do you often look for Gu Qi Shao with this method? I wouldn't say often. The stone gate is closed. Qi Shao must have locked the door from the inside. Oh! Look, one of you is a martial arts expert, the other a poison expert, but when it comes to machinery, just leave it to me, Tang Li. Look, a door can be a "living door" or a "dead door". If this door is a "living door", in order to prevent outsiders from entering, there must be a piece of stone inside blocking the gate valve. Of course, there are many ways to open the door, such as a lever, mercury, pressure or buoyancy. So let's observe for a while first. Observe for a while first... Hey! Aren't you afraid of traps? Or those swooshing arrows? Poison Girl! Qi Shao. You're selling fake medicine! You hid yourself quite well. You shouldn't have come here. What happened? It's very dangerous here. Leave with them quickly! Ghost Valley is in trouble. I can't just watch and do nothing! My god! That impudent girl is flirting with another man right in front of you! It's proven that she has an affair! Poison Girl. You see what's going on here. Whether they can be saved or not depends on this. This is... the Millennial Udumbara? Yes. I made it into powder. It can be spread throughout Ghost Valley this way. Gu Qi Shao. This tea of yours smells quite nice. This isn't tea. It's poison! Seal your meridians! Your Highness! Your Highness! Han Yun Xi. It's all thanks to you. Without you, I couldn't find this place. Who are you? Do you know me? You are Madam Tian Xin's daughter. Of course, I know you. Are you... Madam Tian Can? Looks like someone still remembers me. You killed my chaperon. You picked my Udumbara and you even want to spoil my plan with it. What are you doing? If I can't use it, neither can you. You heedless, reckless creatures. The Amber Bracelet is quite a treasure. It can block my Miasma of Darkness. It saved your life. However, I don't deprive others of their love, except... you're willing to give it to me. Seven days ago, I picked a Millennial Udumbara at a secluded area of the valley. I wanted to sell it at a good price, but I noticed that the villagers had already been infected with poisonous insects. At that time, buyers from all over the country have come here after hearing the news. So I thought of a makeshift solution. I told Mu Ling Er to placate the people with a fake one. Since the poison spread very fast, I cut the sky-vessel tramways and sealed off Ghost Valley. I took the Millennial Udumbara to a secret room and made it into powder. I preserved its detoxifying effect to solve Ghost Valley's crisis. But I didn't expect that the crisis wasn't solved, instead, it has drawn her here. Now the Millennial Udumbara is destroyed. Without a new cure for the poison, all the people in the village will die. Not only did I involve so many heroes from all over the country, even we are now fatally poisoned. So she used the insects' poison to seal herself. Then used the Udumbara to prolong her life and fix her looks. Among the four great sacred items, this Amber Bracelet is the most different one. Though it can detect and control poison, it can't cure you of poison. Look. Tian Xin Spirit Return Pill can remove thousands of poisons. Vermin stay far away from it. Poison Girl. You have the recipe for Tian Xin Powder. Yeah. This is a method of poison removing poison left by my mother through the fight between the Sect of Poison and the Sect of Insects. It will cure you of a thousand kinds of poison and relieve people from the pain of insect poison. It's a pity that I lost part of the page. Are you talking about this? Why do you have it? I thought you were a spy back then. So I stole it and used it as an insole. This is the most complicated detoxification method I've ever seen. Medicine is the one thing my Ghost Valley doesn't lack. The Amber Bracelet can only control the poison in your body temporarily. You should go and rest inside, Your Highness. How can I help? You're helping me by wiping my sweat off? I was wrong about you. I already told you a long time ago. Even though the empress dowager gifted our marriage, I'm not a spy. Oh, right. After being poisoned by the Miasma of Darkness, I keep hallucinating about a general from Western Qin and a lady in her prime. You are the Saintess of Sect of Grain. You're beautiful beyond words. Yet you promise your heart to a lowly man like me. General, you are talented, handsome, powerful and heroic. His Majesty has now put you into an important position. You save the country from danger. Why do you lack self-confidence and self-respect? It's reminding you that you owe me a wedding ceremony. You even missed our wedding night! I had to kick the sedan chair door myself. You're really something. Tang Li! I didn't expect the poison to come into effect so quickly. Their inner force is too weak. They can't resist the Miasma of Darkness. Looks like we can't wait for the Tian Xin Powder to be finished. But the people in the tavern and the market... At any time, they'll... Let me think for awhile. Sister Princess Consort. You won't abandon us, right? I won't. What are you doing? Wear this. But... But I don't know how to use it. It's very simple, actually. When you use it, shout it out loud. It will seem even cooler. Your Highness. take good care of them. I will be back soon. Also, take good care of yourself, too. Once I return to the mansion, I will reorganize the troops and destroy her lair! There's no time. I must set out immediately. We can't wait. It is up to the doer to undo the knot. She said she's interested in my Amber Bracelet. We are both ladies of poison. This may be our only option. But Ghost Valley extends over hundreds of kilometers. There are many places where I haven't even set foot. How will you find her? The flickering lights of the poisonous insects will tell me the way. I, Han Yun Xi, will cure your insect poison. I, the Genius Consort of Poison, didn't gain my fame out of nowhere. You're waiting for me? An ugly lowly girl from the mansion of the Imperial Physician Han, weak and easily bullied. On the day of her wedding, when the bridal sedan chair was at the door, she got kicked out many times, and was given the cold shoulder everywhere. Struggling, she lives inside the King's mansion. I'm afraid your title of Princess Consort exists in name only. Why are you saying all this? You are a rare poison genius, too. Leave that place full of deception and intrigues where human are no longer what they used to be. Stay with me. Train insects and create poison. You'll live a carefree life. You want this, don't you? I want to make a deal with you. Is this how an admirable Princess Consort begs other people? I'm willing to offer this Nine Flowers Amber Bracelet. Please save my husband and friends! That's more like it. I'll take this. Needle Storm! How cunning! No one of the Sect of Poison masters is a good person. Aging is the real poison for a woman. I will make you, a beautiful Princess Consort, experience my suffering. I will take... what belongs to me. I will also... fulfill my promise to you. I will use it to check if my nutriments are ready. I'm worried I may not tell the time right. Listen! I can give that Amber Bracelet to you, but those people at the tavern and the market are innocent! You want to negotiate now? It's too late. No! Yun Xi. You're back. Have you got the cure? Yun Xi. I'll compensate you with a wedding ceremony to qualify you as the Princess Consort. You have the Amber Bracelet. Qi Shao said this is your mother's token of love. Token of love. General. After our farewell, I've been missing you, Many times, I've met you in my dreams. I've imagined countless scenarios for our reunion in those countless months. But in the end, there's nothing. Perhaps, I'm not ready yet. If one day, my hair has turned white, my face is wrinkled, will you still love me? You don't have to answer! I've already known the answer. I have a Spirit Returning Song. It can disperse the Miasma of Darkness. I will fulfill the promises I made. When you use it, shout it out loud. It will seem even cooler. Needle Storm! Looks like the insects will break out from their cocoons tonight. What should we do, then? Once the poisonous insects break out, their internal organs will be hollow and dried up. But there will still be blood left inside the heart meridian. But by tomorrow morning when the sunlight shines on them, they will crumble on touch like sand. Is there nothing we can do? Of course there is. We only need to wait for the moment the lovely insects break through their cocoons and admire their beauty. Poison Girl. Is there really no way to save them? Don't believe her! She's fake! I'm the real Han Yun Xi! Oh. You do look a bit like my Sister Princess Consort. But you are so old. What are you up to? I'm affected by her Stone-Face Poison. Don't believe her! Look. This is the Needle Storm you gave me. Then explain to us, why did you remove the Miasma of Darkness for us? Do I even need to explain? If you don't believe me, just kill me. I will! Yun Xi! Yun Xi! I'm sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. Your Highness. I'm all right. Go help them quickly. Only with this can you fight her. Sister Princess Consort. Come on, kill me. Damn. She's fake! She's fake! You can't do it, can you? Let me do it then. I'll give it back to you. It's poisonous! Yun Xi! Stop! Don't come here. I don't want you to see my face. Yun Xi. I promise you, I will find a way to restore your appearance. I knew that she wasn't you. Yun Xi. I can answer that question now. One day, when your face has become wrinkled and your hair has turned white, I will still love you. Qi Shao! Qi Shao! Sister Yun Xi may be a bit busy right now. How about you helping me get rid of the poison? Your poison doesn't need treatment, your body can self-cure. Hey. Don't be so petty. You have so many thousand-year-old ginseng, lucid ganoderma and herbs. Just give me some,. Oh, no! Do you mean if the host is dead, the poisonous insects will scatter. Unless she fell into the sea of clouds but didn't die. Oh no. We fell for her trick! The Madam Tian Can who just died was just a puppet. That's why she could make so many changes! We focused our attention on the wrong place. She diverted our attention! No way. I suffered this poison for nothing? Three times! How much time do we have? Without the Amber Bracelet, I can't really tell. She said that the insects would break out from their cocoons tonight. It's already past five o'clock. We need to hurry. This is our last chance. Look. No matter how you turn the poisoned people, they point towards the same direction. It's the host's direction! To the northeast! That's Mount Lingshan. Looks like the insects have broken out from their cocoons. We need to hurry. I haven't had the time to say it, To the north is Mount Lingshan. It is a deathtrap. Whoever goes there never returns alive. But someone has to do this sooner or later. Okay. I'll risk my life to go with you. OK. I'll go, too. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! You came after all. You killed so many people, of course we had to come! Little girl. Since you and I are both Poison Girls, leave immediately and I will spare you. Your poison harms people. My poison saves people. You truly talk big. You picked my Udumbara. and ruined my appearance, Now you try to stop me from gathering my nutriments to restore my beauty? How can I keep the appointment with my husband like this? Can you sacrifice so many people's lives just for your love? They should be thanking me! These lowly bodies are sacrificed for my great love! With such an ending, they will feel honored even after death! But you! You can't stop meddling. Then don't blame us for getting rid of the vermin that you are! Scarlet Blinding Cicada! It's poisonous! Today, none of you will leave! Your Highness! Die! All of you! Needle Storm! Sister Princess Consort! No! Today, I will make you feel the pain of losing your love, and the pain of heartache. No! No! Your Highness. If there is a next life, remember to give me a wedding ceremony. Do you want to die? It's not that simple! I'll make you feel the pain of a thousand insects piercing your heart! Alive, I will return to you safe. Alive, I will return to you safe. In death, I will forever long for you. In death, I will forever long for you. Alive, I will return to you safe. Alive, I will return to you safe. In death, I will forever long for you. I don't want to long for you forever. I want us to be together in life and death. In death, I will forever long for you. No. Where is he? If I'm not mistaken, he was clad in military attire of the last dynasty, Western Qin. He... When will he come back? That war has ended. Western Qin was destroyed long ago. The one you're waiting for won't be coming back. No. You... You... You're lying! Humans don't live past 100 years. Without the Millennial Udumbara, you would have turned into a skeleton long ago. Why do you keep lying to yourself? No! I've been studying the art of poison since I was little. I only realized in the end that the strongest poison is love. Look! Yun Xi. You're back. Make sure it isn't crooked! Come here. I've told you already, this has to be in the great hall. The scent of lavender helps people calm down and concentrate. It's perfect for crowds. Your Highness. Go change it. Okay. Be careful, don't break it. Hurry! Put this over here. I've never heard of a lady of Tianning who took care of her own wedding. What a scandal! I've never heard of a husband of Tianning who didn't kick the sedan chair's door himself on the day of his wedding either. If you can forget about that, I will let you have whatever kind of wedding ceremony you want. Speaking of which, this is your second wedding. Qi Shao. If we go by the books, we should stay low-profile. I want everyone in the world to know that Han Yun Xi is mine. so other men can stop thinking about her. You should watch her carefully then, in case she falls into my hands by accident. You know how charming I am. [Poison Valley Bride] [Tang's Unique Skill] That impudent girl, she doesn't even return my Needle Storm. Now I have to learn a new thing. Congratulation on Master Peng obtaining the Golden Pill of Traversing Adversity for 500 gold. I will keep the Pill and you!
