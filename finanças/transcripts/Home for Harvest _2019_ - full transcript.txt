[Instrumental music] [instrumental music] [man on radio] Good morning, listeners. Bad news for those of you heading into the city. Traffic is backed up from the uptown ramp all the way eastbound to the 170. Downtown, we have closures from Milton Avenue to Angel Pass. [Instrumental music] Hi. Hey. Welcome back, boss. I wish I could say it was nice to be back, but... I swear I just left Heaven. I take it your trip to Cinque Terre went well? Are you kidding me? By far, the best place in Italy. The views, the water, the hiking. Not to mention the food and the wine. I already have my first paragraph and my hook for my story: "Italy, a love letter from alpha to olive oil." I can't wait to read all about it. Miss Taylor, they want you for an editorial meeting. They must know where your next assignment is. I'm guessing Goa. No wait, Bora Bora. I hear those beaches are to die for. [Gasping] I did ask for the Maldives. I hear there's some really cool things happening in Austin. Austin? - Texas? - Yeah. My cousin went there a few months back for a music festival. She said it was super cool. - No. - No. Katie Taylor does not travel for just "super cool." The magazine only sends her to the most fabulous destinations on the planet. Have you not read her piece on Madagascar? Of course, she's read my piece. Everyone's read my piece. It was number one story for the season. You two keep guessing, I'm late for my meeting. Oh. And I've been to Austin, bigger is not always better. That's true. [Instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] I'm telling you, this issue is gonna sell out. There she is, our superstar! Katie, I've read your opening paragraph. - Really great hook! - Thank you. I had a great time, and I think it shows in the work. It does. So, I guess you're wondering where we're sending you next. Always my favorite part of the job. Don't leave me in anticipation. Where are you sending me? Greenville! Is there a Greenville in Bora Bora? - No. - In Goa? Not that I'm aware of. Oh, please tell me that there is a town called Greenville in the Maldives. If there is, I'm unaware of it. We're talking about Greenville, the small town that you grew up in! There's a harvest festival that happens around this time every year. I am familiar with the Harvest Festival. Cool! Yeah, we thought it would be great to get a real hometown look at the food, the people, the celebrations. And who better to send than our very own Katie Taylor who grew up there? Absolutely anybody other than me? That was a rhetorical question. This is the kind of personal touch that our readership has been yearning for. I don't know if my readers are really expecting that of me, but I hear there are great things in Austin. - Texas? - "Bigger the better." - I always say. - Hmm. I'll agree your readers won't expect that from you, and that's the beauty of it. - But I... - Katie. We're sending you back home. You're gonna brush off the big city, get reacquainted with your hometown roots. - It'll be fun! - Hmm. Okay, just think of it as a fish out of water story. Oh, boy! Okay, Avi, if that's what the magazine feels is the right thing, then I am a team player, and I will go. - Go, team! - Yeah. Oh! Can you just remember one thing? Fish need water to live. [Instrumental music] You know, Greenville doesn't look all that bad. It's kind of quaint. Quaint is just another word for "nothing" of any importance ever happens there. Well, then, this harvest festival seems like a big deal there. [Katie] It's a small town in the middle of nowhere, everything's a big deal. They give participation ribbons to pigs. [Sighing] I hope you can find me a decent hotel. I remember, growing up, hotels were an issue. It can't all be negative. At least, you can visit with your family. What's left of it. You must have some friends you kept in touch with. Are you kidding me? I left there so fast... I left two flaming trails and three sonic booms. Oh, they probably all hate me. Girl, I don't think a whole town could hate you. People in small towns have a lot of time on their hands to hold grudges. Well, it's your chance to reconnect. Maybe. [Sighing] My sister lives there. I haven't seen her in a long time. See? Family. Yeah, it would be nice to see her again. I haven't talked to her in a really long time. What happened? She called, and I told her I would call her back when I wasn't busy. - And? - And I never called her back. - Katie! - But I am still busy. Well, I think this is gonna be good for you. Good for both of you. Maybe. [Sighs] Okay, what exactly is the article gonna be about? Small town harvest festival, community, family, blah, blah. Okay, that sounds... fun. - Hmph! - You'll figure it out. Ugh! [Instrumental music] Well, if the train station is any indication, Greenville hasn't changed one bit. [Willa] I'm sure it's not that bad. Remember, you have friends and memories there. Friends? One friend who happens to be my sister. She's family, friend by default. Think of the memories. Can you just text me my reservation to my hotel? About that... What about that? Willa, tell me I have a reservation. The Harvest Festival, small town, no room. Where am I supposed to stay? I got your sister's number from your contacts. Oh no, I am not calling my sister to impose. You don't have to, I've already called and everything is set up and taken care of. Uh, you did not call my sister. You're welcome. Your driver should be there in five, four, three... They have that here? [Willa on phone] See? It's not that bad. [Honking] Oh, not that bad. Maybe I'll use that as the title of my article. Just try and have some fun. [Katie] Yeah, well, if you don't hear from me in the next 24 hours, just assume I've died of boredom. If that's the case, can I have your wardrobe? No. Taking it with me. [Frank] Little Katie Taylor! I haven't seen you in years! Mr. Shannon, you're my ride? Call me Frank, please. You have a career and pay taxes uh, you can drop the "Mister" nonsense. And yeah, I've retired. I had to do something or I would have died of boredom. - Right? - What? Uh, nothing. It's really nice to see you, Mr... Frank. You too, Katie. - It's been a long time. - Yeah. Your sister's gonna be very happy to see you. Yeah. [Instrumental music] [man on radio] A big heads-up, traveling northbound on Hill Road between I-7 and the Interstate, a couple of Mr. Colton's cows have escaped their pen - mooo! And are proving to be a little bit of a nuisance as neighbors try to mooove them back in. Also, a reminder, the Harvest Festival just around the corner. Tickets still available and as always, there will be dancing, food and fun for the whole family. [Instrumental music] [instrumental music] Brings back a lot of memories, doesn't it? Sure does. Wow! It's been forever. [Instrumental music] Oh, you didn't have to do that. I could have grabbed my own bag. Don't give it a second thought. Chivalry isn't dead yet. It may be on life support, but it's still kicking. Thank you, Frank. [Instrumental music] [engine cranking] [instrumental music] [honking] You know, if you missed this place so much, you could visit more often. Look at you all dressed up. Gotta dress to impress. And you look... great. I mean, purple, uh, purple's always been your color. It brings out your... skin tone. Oh, please, just happy I'm not covered in kid vomit at the moment. But those shoes are fabulous. Completely impractical, but fabulous. They're actually quite comfortable. I'll buy you a pair for Christmas. Don't you dare waste your money. Unless you think they would look really good with my scrubs and stained sweatpants? Hmm. It's so great to see you. You too. Well, come on inside. Michael won't be here for a bit, but Maggie can't wait to see you. Yes. Oh! Oh! - Oh! - Come on. [Instrumental music] [sighing] Make yourself at home. I'll go and try to find the little monster. [Instrumental music] - Aunt Katie! - Hey, kiddo! - I'm a princess. - Oh, I can see. And what a beautiful princess you are. You're like the most beautiful princess in all of the land. Are you a dragon? Aaah... roarrr! You need to protect me, dragon. - Oh no. - What? It's just a little princess-dragon bonding time. Yeah, it's just that Maggie was painting and hasn't washed her hands yet. - Oh! - Apologize to Aunt Katie. I'm sorry. It's okay. I have a great dry cleaner in the city. Don't be silly, I can clean it here. I am a pro at getting paint out of clothing. It's all part of having kids! - We'll play later? - Okay. - Roarrrr! - Dragon. - [Chuckling] - Come on, sweetheart. [Sighing] [crickets chirping] [people laughing] There's no way that's true. Well, I am all out of wine, so that means I'm done for the night. - Oh, have another. - Oh no, I'm good. I'm gonna go tuck Princess Maggie into her sleeping bag. I'll give you two some time to catch up. - Goodnight. - Night. He is a good man. Yeah. I lucked out. So... So... - Best beaches? - Um, okay. Ummm... Seychelles. Best food? Oh, that's a tough one, but it's very hard to beat Italy. Hmm... Best place for honeymoon? Okay, if I was ever in a position where a honeymoon was a possibility, I'd go Bora Bora. You mean to tell me that in all those travels, you haven't found Mr. Tall, dark and handsome? I am never anywhere long enough to meet someone, and I'm never home long enough to keep anybody, so... Well, at least, you made it out of this town doing what you love. Thank you, but... it's not exactly the kind of reporting I thought I'd be doing when I got into journalism. I mean, look at you. You're a nurse, you help people. That is a meaningful life. It's not like I dreamed of this. When mom got sick, I took care of her, and, well, it kind of just stuck, I guess. Yeah. That can't have been easy taking care of mom. Wasn't, but I don't regret the time I spent with her. I should have been here to help you. Mom would have never wanted that for you. You went out and made something of yourself. She was so proud of you. I'm gonna go to bed, but talk more tomorrow? I'd like that. Oh, I totally forgot. There's a party tomorrow night to kick off the Harvest Festival. - You should come. - Absolutely not. - No, I am not. - Come on. There's gonna be a ton of people from school there. Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of. I am hoping to keep this trip on the down low. [Laughs] Katie, this is a small town, everyone already knows you're here. Everyone? Oh yeah, everyone. So, how was your first night home? Uneventful as expected. Although I don't know if it's gonna stay that way. What do you mean? Well, Paige said that everyone knows I'm here. [Willa] So? - So, everyone meaning Chad. Chad meaning the reason why I left Greenville in the first place. I knew this was a bad idea. [Willa on phone] You're probably worrying about nothing. Focus on work. Your first meeting's with Mr. And Mrs. Carlisle, and they're expecting you in ten minutes. [Katie on phone] I'll be there. Seriously, Willa, what if I bump into him? I mean... [gasping] Oh, my... - Are you alright? - I gotta go, Willa. I just spilled coffee all over myself, no, I am not alright. Well, I can get you another cup of coffee if you want one. It's not the coffee I'm worried about, it's the $300 blouse that it spilled onto that I'm worried about. You paid $300 for that? - Uh! Yes. - For a shirt? It's a Joanna Jorn. Congratulations. Handmade in Scandinavia... Are you even gonna apologize? Well, technically, you ran into me. What? You're trying to get off on a technicality? Oh, yeah, I mean, I was just standing here and you bumped into me. - I don't have time for this. - You were walking and talking. Watch where you're walking. "Joanna Jorn." And here we are 30 years later still running the restaurant, still... madly in love. - Katie, sweetheart. - Oh, yeah, Thirty years, wow! That's a long time. You know, a little club soda will get that stain out. - I'll go get you some. - Really? Thank you. Uhhh... spill something on yourself? No, actually. I was talking on the phone and waling on the street, and I turned around and out of the blue, some guy bumps into me. Not only did he not apologize, as I was walking away, he yelled, "Watch where you're walking!" Um, sounds like you bumped into him, dear. Sounds like an accident. Thank you. So, 30 years running the same restaurant, still in love. Ah, madly in love. [Chuckling] We wouldn't have wanted it any other way. I remember coming in here with my family all the time. You had your 10th birthday here. You remember that? Oh, she remembers everything. And we've been lucky enough to watch the people in this town grow up. We've catered everything from baby showers to funerals. And everything in-between. Wow, it's a lot. Your article is about small town, right? Yeah, it's about coming home, a simpler way of life, hometown festival, hometown food. That's just it, those big city restaurants, they're all about getting customers in and out as fast as possible. Everybody's always in a rush. The hustle and bustle. [Mr. Carlisle] Just so someone can eat a meal as quickly as they can all while texting on their phone and sometimes taking a picture of it. Why? So they can remember what they ate? Okay, I have been guilty of doing that once or twice. Aaah... But don't you guys ever wish, I don't know, you had a chance to see the world? We've seen entire lifetimes, moments both big and small, heartbreaking and heartwarming, and there's beauty in all of it. [Birds chirping] [honking] Thanks, Frank! [Instrumental music] "Greenville Herald." Is that Chad's car? Because I... Okay, don't freak out. - He's not in there, is he? - Aah... You let him into your house?! What was I supposed to do? He's your ex-boyfriend, not an ex-convict. I don't know, he is the one person I am trying to avoid here. Go in there... deep breaths... [breathing deeply] And be civil. It was a long time ago, and you're both adults now. Kind of. Come on. He is waiting for you on the deck. Like an adult. Chad. Hi. Uh, what are you doing here? Uh, here, these are for you. I know they're your favorites. Thank you. I was hoping we could talk. Hmm, still at the Greenville Herald, I see? Yes. Yeah. Yeah, some things never change. Some things do. That's what I want to talk about. I owe you an apology. I've been thinking a lot about... us back when we were kids, and I know I... may have been less than honorable with some of your newspaper articles. Chad, you stole my story about corruption in the municipal election, and you took all the credit for it, and you got statewide recognition. Okay, technically, it wasn't stealing because... What is it with people in this town trying to get off on technicalities? Look, I was the junior editor of the local newspaper at the time... You were only the junior editor because your parents owned the newspaper at the time and... And that was a long time ago, Chad. And I'm sorry for it. I was young, I made bad decisions and it cost me more than I thought it would. [Sighing] Hey, everybody deserves a second chance, right? Hey, are you going to the party later tonight? I've got a lot of work to do, I wasn't planning on it. Well, I, I hope I see you there. It was really good to see you again, Katie. [Instrumental music] So? What? That seemed cordial. You should have warned me about the flowers. [Sniffing] [crickets chirping] [keys clacking] [sighing] Paige? When is this party? [Upbeat music] So you, Katie Taylor, did the interview with that coffee stain on your shirt? I didn't have a choice. [Giggling] How were Mr. And Mrs. Carlisle? Good. In love. - Aww! - The same. Well, if you see the guy you bumped into here tonight point him out. - I doubt I'm gonna see him. - Hey! It is a pretty small town, remember? Trust me, I remember. [Instrumental music] Uh-oh. Look who's coming over here. What? You said it. We're all adults, people change, and everyone deserves a second chance. Okay, but just to recap, Chad went from He-who-cannot-be-named to Mr. Not-so-bad? - Okay... - In five hours? - Yeah, but... - That's gotta be a record. Ohhh... Ugh. Have fun! Where are you going? Paige? Katie. You made it out after all. Yeah, I mean, it was either this or binge watching Zombie Cats on the Loose, so... Well, I'm really glad you're here. - Yeah. - You look great. Thank you. I guess we're gonna be judging Greenville's Best Dish contest together. - Oh, you're a judge too? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It should be fun. - Yeah. ♪ Oh oh oh ♪ ♪ With all the things ♪ ♪ I do your love will... ♪ - Do you hear that? - What? ♪ You're out there in the world ♪ I think they're playing our song. No. - No, no, no, no. - Yes. Yes. ♪ Taped up to the wall ♪ You planned this, didn't you? ♪ Ohhh ohhh ohhh ♪ I bet you don't remember the moves. - Yes, I do. - Prove it.

Yes, Blue Lagoon. What the heck. - Oh! Oh! - Boh. You again. You can't accuse me of ruining another $300 outfit because this is just water. - Mm-hmm. - I don't drink. But if you want to be sure, a little carbonated water will get that right out. Oh, very funny, I am sure that passes as charisma where you're from. How do you know I'm not from here? Because I'm from here and if you were, I would know it. Hmm... Really? You're from Greenville? You don't, uh, you don't look the part. Why? Because I'm not wearing a plaid shirt and some cowboy boots? I'm sure you could pull off a plaid shirt better than any woman in here. As a matter of fact, if I would have known that the women in this town were as beautiful as you, I would have moved here much sooner. Hey, hey... Now that... that passes for charisma where I'm from. Who the heck are you? Some good-looking guy who randomly bumps into women? Yeah. And my work is done here. But it's nice to know that you think I'm good looking. Oh, I did not say... Oh, yes, I did. [Scoffs] Hey. Is everything okay? Oh, yeah. You know what, Chad? I think I'm gonna call it a night. It's getting late, and I have a lot of work to do. Yeah, okay. Um, get home safe. - Thanks. Goodnight. - Yeah. Goodnight. [Instrumental music] [slurping] - Wait. The same guy? [Katie] Yeah, the same guy. - Twice in one day? - Yeah. Can you believe it? What are the mathematical chances of that happening? Well, apparently better than you'd think. Listen, yoga is supposed to help you relax. So stop thinking about him. - Good idea. I gotta go, Willa. Okay. Remember, 2 p.m. interview, Noah James. Got it. Okay, gotta get my sun on. Bye. [Both chanting] Hmmmmmm... Hungry and cold... Okay, this is obviously not working. Is there a place in this town I can get some avocado toast? I don't know about that, but there is a great new breakfast place up the street. Let's roll. It seems like you and Chad were hitting it off. I don't know. It was fun, nothing to write about. But then I got that drink poured all over me. Hey, it was just water. Still, two bad run-ins with one guy in one day? It's worse than being in the city. Katie: And if I ever see that guy again, I will throw a drink in his smug face. I thought you said he had a pretty face. Oh, well, a guy can be smug and pretty at the same time. - I call it "smutty." - Okay. I know that you're a writer, but you can't just smash two words together and make it a thing. "Smutty" will never catch on. "Smutty"? You mean smug and pretty? Are you talking about anybody I know? You again. You really have to stop calling me pretty. I mean, it's good for my ego, but I prefer... ruggedly handsome. It's him. He is him. From yesterday and last night. Oh, him! You're Bump-and-spill guy. - Hi, I'm Noah. - Paige. So you're new to town. Yeah, a couple of months now. And you must be Katie Taylor. And how do you know my name? Your magazine called and set up an interview with me. A woman by the name of Willa. She was really quite lovely on the phone by the way. Willa's a peach. So, this is your restaurant? Yep. Noah James. Pleasure to formally meet you. It's nice to meet you while you're not spilling beverages all over me for once. - Well, technically... - Really? - Again with the technicalities? - Okay. It seems like you two have a lot to talk about. - I'm gonna head out. - No, no, no. I gotta get cleaned up, take a shower. - I am not dressed for this. - It's just an interview. You'll be fine. I'm gonna take this. - And I'll meet you at home. - No, please don't go. I wouldn't want your friend to throw a drink at my smug, yet pretty face. You know what? Just feed her. I think she's a little "hangry." [Gasping] Hey, that one works. Huh! So... So... Come on in. So I looked you up. Greenville seems like a bit of a departure from your usual stories. Yeah, well, the paper wanted to do a story on a "small town," and they found out I was from here, so... Don't make it sound so bad being "from here." Don't get me wrong, I mean, I love this town just in very small, small doses. [Laughing] Well, you're a big city girl now. Yeah, well, nothing against black coffee and bacon and eggs for breakfast. I just prefer my half-caf, skinny soy, vanilla latte with an order of avocado toast. Does that make me a horrible person? Not in my book. There's this place in the city that makes the best avocado toast. I mean, they use super-thick bread and it is to die for. Now, is there anything else other than a trendy fruit on bread dish that drew you to the big city? Yeah, I wanted to be a journalist in a big paper, travel the world, you know, cover important stories and... It's pretty much what you do, isn't it? Not exactly. I... I take selfies in front of pretty beaches and wineries. Sounds like a great life to me. Oh, it is. I mean I love it, it's just not exactly what I set out to do. I mean... But hey, I have an amazing wardrobe, usually, a fantastic collection of shoes and more Air Miles than I can count, so, hey, what else could a girl ask for, right? I was thinking, maybe a boyfriend. I'm sorry, what? Uhh, I thought maybe you left Greenville to follow your boyfriend. Oh! But no. Actually, it's kind of the opposite. I sort of left Greenville in part because of my ex. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. But hey, I am the one that's supposed to be asking the questions. I'm an open book, fire away. Okay. So what's your story? You move to a small town, start spilling drinks on unsuspecting women? - Well... - And don't say technically. [Laughs] It's pretty funny, my story is actually the complete opposite of yours. - How so? - I grew up in the big city. I always wanted to open my own restaurant, and I did. And when things didn't work out with my fiancee, I wanted out of the rat race. I was tired of the hustle and bustle. I love the hustle and bustle. I just... I wanted to leave all of that behind. I was tired of trying to keep up with the latest restaurant trends. I just wanted to cook real food for real people. This whole farm-to-table thing was right up your alley. You miss avocado toast, right? - I do. - And you're absolutely right. It should start with thick slices of fresh bread. Follow me. Thick. Now, you don't want the toast too crispy. Are you making me avocado toast? With most places, there isn't much difference between their guacamole and their avocado smash that they put on toast, which is their first mistake. Intriguing. How so? Guacamole is usually in the supporting role for dishes like nachos with cheese, quesadillas, tacos, but with avocado toast, it's the headlining act. So? So we gotta bring out its natural flavors. - Okay. - And it's simple. Add a little more sea salt. [Grinding] A dash more lemon. Ooh! Alright. And once it's plated fresh ground pepper. Ohhh... voila. Okay. Mmm! Wow! See? That is the power of local farm to table. The bread is from the bakery down the street, and they make it fresh every morning with natural ingredients. - It's incredible! - Thanks. Maybe I'll enter that in the Harvest Festival. You totally should. I was gonna enter a hamburger and try and beat the Greenville Grill at her own game. Noah: The local paper always gives them the best reviews. Oh, Chad loves that place. He runs the local paper. You know Chad? I do. We used to date. Hah! I will not hold that against you. Hmm. I appreciate the fact that you love my avocado toast, but now I have to start making breakfast for the rest of my customers, so... Uh, but we're not done our interview. You know where to find me. Mmm... Mm! Mmm, so good! [Crickets chirping] I am sorry I'm so late. I was scouting locales. How did it go with Noah? Uh, he opened his restaurant a couple of months ago, and I tried his avocado toast. - It was amazing! - Fancy! I didn't realize anybody in town even made avocado toast. It wasn't on his menu, but he made it for me. Really? He made you something off menu. It is no big deal. Did you ask him to? I happened to mention that I like avocado toast. And...? Before I knew it, avocado toast. Huh! - It's no big deal. - Sure. I'll warm you up something for dinner. Okay, thanks. I'm working the late shift tonight. Do you mind tucking in Maggie? She's sort of been waiting for you. - Yeah, of course. - Thanks. Umm... what do I do? - [Chuckles] You give her a hug. - Yep. Pull up her blankets and tell her that there are no scary monsters waiting for her underneath the bed. Oh, so you want me to lie? - Pfff! - Okay. Hey, munchkin. I heard you were waiting up for me to tuck you in. - Can I ask you something? - Of course. Why don't you come and visit us more? You do love mom and me, right? Oh! Of course I do. It's just... Sometimes people get really busy at their jobs or busy doing something that's really important to them. They don't have as much time to visit as they'd want to. Do you understand? - I think so. - Good. I'll tell you what, tomorrow, we'll spend some time together. - Pinky swear? - Pinky swear. Okay, goodnight. You get some sleep. - And sweet dreams. - Goodnight. [Instrumental music] Are you ready? There's a lot of pumpkins here. Here to pick the best one. Whoa, look at that! Alright. You go pick out a pumpkin, okay? - Yeah. - Go on! How about this one? There is a whole field of pumpkins, you can't just pick out the first one you see. How do you know this is the best pumpkin unless you look at all of them? - Okay. I'll keep looking. - [Laughing] [instrumental music] [camera click] My editor wants me to take some pictures for my article. - Do you mind? - Sure. You've always looked great surrounded by pumpkins. - Oh, why, thank you. - [Laughs] [camera clicking] - How do I look? - Good. It looks like you're having fun. I am having fun. You know, it's really something, the life that you built with Michael and Maggie. You have a beautiful family. I do, but it's been really nice having all of my family here, even if it's just for a little bit. It's been nice having you around, Katie. I miss you too, and I promise I will come more often. Okay. I think I found one, mommy, but it's too heavy. You've got to come help. Wow! That is a big pumpkin! This is the one? - Yeah. - Alright! Do you mind? Here you go. [Paige] For the littlest girl. Perfect! [Chuckling] [camera click] Aw, thank you. Now, let's pick up this pumpkin. Ready? You ready? [All growling] [instrumental music] Looking for something? Oh, um, no. I was just, um... Watching people eat their dinner? No. I was, um... Oh, you must be here to finish the interview. Yes, the interview. That is why I'm here. Are you available by any chance? - Do you like ice cream? - Everyone loves ice cream. Great. There's a place down the street. - I'll buy you a scoop. - Okay. So, do you enjoy being back in Greenville? Yeah, you know... [moans] This ice cream might be better than your avocado toast. - No offence. - None taken. Let me guess, local cows, grass-fed? Of course. You really care about this stuff, don't you? Listen, you might have to pay a little bit extra, but isn't it so worth it? Mmm... Absolutely. So, you ended up in Greenville after things didn't work out with your fiancee? Well, technically, she wasn't my fiancee. Okay, there you go with your "technically" again. I got down on one knee and I had a ring, but she broke up with me. - Ouch. - No. No, no, no. She was the smart one. She knew we weren't meant to be together. I was looking for a change of pace, and she was... Well, she was like you. She wanted the hustle and bustle of the big city. "Hustle and bustle." I started as a chef at a downtown restaurant. We used to get over 200 people in at the lunch rush. And you can make a lot of money, but that just goes towards your big-city rent or the newest car or a vacation to the Maldives. Hey, Maldives are gorgeous. But then, you're just working to pay for those things. So eventually, the things you own just end up owning you. [Instrumental music] Okay. Maybe I can see your point. Besides, if I hadn't moved here, I wouldn't have found this great ice cream place. Hmm. Now, that would have been a crime. - Exactly. - [Chuckles] Although, you just went for a plain vanilla, and I would have thought a world traveler like you would have been a little more adventurous. Hey, I know what I like. Besides, what kind of weird combination did you get? What's so weird about raspberry and pistachio? Ummm, everything is weird about that combination. No, it's not as strange as it sounds. I mean, it combines a sweet flavor with a salty flavor. - Go ahead, try. - Um... And make sure you get the raspberry with the pistachio. You know, even you saying that sounds weird. - Hmm... - See? The chef knows a few things about mixing flavors. Not quite sure, I think I'll have to try another taste. No, no, no. Just take it easy, Big City. It's not bad. - It's actually really good. - [Chuckling] [instrumental music] So, how is everything going at home? Are you dying for a decent latte? Actually, it's not that bad. I had some incredible ice cream last night. The food here is amazing. Everything is fresh and organic and... So maybe the editors were right to send you out there. It's been interesting. Interesting? Interesting usually means a guy, so spill it! Funny choice of words. You remember Bump-and-spill guy? [Willa] Yeah. - He's actually really sweet. And your ex? He's not like I remember him. Mm-hmm, I thought you said nothing ever happens in Greenville. It's nothing to get excited about. Okay, I gotta go. I gotta give a trophy to a goat. - Wait, what?! - You booked it. [Beeping] Really is a goat. Huh! [Instrumental music] Chad: Not exactly Turks and Caicos. You read my article. I've read all your articles. I think they're amazing. And I think it's really cool that you're gonna be giving Greenville some publicity. Well, I don't know how much publicity this place needs. Besides, you have a great local paper. Thank you. We've been very lucky. Can't thank the people of this town enough for the support they've given the paper. Well, that's pretty gracious of Chad Porter. Well... this town has supported my family paper for a long time now, even after I took over officially. They've been great to me. I've been working there since I was old enough to push a broom across the floor. I remember. My parents did a great job with the paper, but I always have my own ideas and, to be honest, it's really nice to be in charge. [Laughing] I don't think I've ever actually said that to anybody before. Guess I can just really be myself with you. Do you wanna maybe hang out while you're in town? - We could grab a coffee. - I... Or tea. I hear tea's popular. - I don't see why not. - Great! - Great. - Great. [Indistinct chatter] [pig grunting] So, any predictions on who's gonna win Best Dish in Greenville? I mean, they're all great restaurants. I'm really excited at all the food that I get to taste. Yeah, that part's gonna be great. But what about that new restaurant? - Noah's place? - Yeah. He seems to be bringing something new to town. - Hmm... - Do you know much about him? I wrote a review when his restaurant first opened. I think he was hoping for a better piece. Really? 'Cause his food seems really great. Yeah, he thinks so too. We got in a fight about it. I'm sure he's a nice guy, but this town's been doing the local farm-to-table thing long before he showed up. Maybe you guys just got off on the wrong foot. Maybe. Whoa! [Instrumental music] That is one majestic goat. Yeah. [Instrumental music] So, do you have a plan for today? I'm gonna go to the farm and check out some of the pumpkins, I guess. - Should be interesting, right? - Yeah. - Hmmm, love you. - Love you. Have a good day. - Hi, Frank. - Paige, how are you doing? Have you been watching your cholesterol? Oh, just like you told me to. So, you know where this place is? - Oh, sure. - Good. So how's the homecoming? Is it as scary as you thought it'd be? It's okay actually. Just okay? Better than okay, I guess. I don't know what I was expecting. It doesn't really matter what you were expecting; it's more about what you find. Well, so far, I find that it has been great. I was worried about running into old friends, thought they'd resent me for leaving this place and going to the big city. Nobody's gonna resent you for that. If they wanted to leave for the city too, there's nothing stopping them. That's true. But I was afraid of running into Chad. - Newspaper Chad? - Yeah. But you know what? He's actually been really nice to me. Nice is... nice. Yeah. Chivalry is not dead. [Chuckles] As long as I keep my cholesterol in check. [Instrumental music] - Hey, Frank. - Noah. Thank you. - Hey. - Hey. - Thanks, Frank. - My pleasure. Just call me if you need me. [Engine cranking] [honking] - Nice boots. - Thanks. What size are they? Why? [Noah chuckling] [instrumental music] [Noah] Ah, don't you worry about it. So do you like, uh... living in Greenville so far? I do, yes. [Noah speaking indistinctly] [instrumental music] Wow! What a view! It's okay. I bet you make great pumpkin pie. Well, you could come by the restaurant again and try a slice. I just might have to do that. So is that why you brought me here? To show me the whole farm-to-table thing in person? Kind of... but I wanted to run an idea by you. Go for it. - Step into my office. - Alright. [Instrumental music] So here's the thing we already have a great pumpkin pie at the restaurant. Assumed to be great. I still have to try a slice and judge for myself. - Of course. - Mm-hmm. But listening to you talk about the big city got me to thinking about some of the things that we could bring from there to here. - Like what? - Pumpkin spice lattes. [Gasping] Intriguing! Did you know that most pumpkin spice lattes don't actually have pumpkin in them? What?! Most big chain coffee shops need to order their supplies months in advance, long before the pumpkin season. So what do they use? Mostly a combination of a few different things, nutmegs, cinnamon, a few others. [Gasps] I feel like I have been lied to my whole entire life. Right? And here in Greenville, we're sitting on a ton of pumpkins, so I figure that maybe we could try something. But what are you gonna do? So, a few different places actually put pumpkin puree in their pumpkin spice lattes. A little like having a slice of pumpkin pie in your pumpkin spice latte? - Sort of. - I love that idea. What do we need first? - Let's pick a pumpkin. - Okay. Alright. [Instrumental music] [instrumental music] Alright. One pumpkin spice latte, real pumpkin. Ah! Ooh! That is horrible! Ah! What?! Really? Oh, I must have made a mistake with the portions. - Hmmm... - Noah... I'm just kidding. It's incredible! [Both chuckling] Aaah... There's one thing that doesn't make any sense to me about you. Really, what's that? Is Chad really the reason that you left Greenville? Because I find that hard to believe. Well, he's one of the reasons. A woman of mystery. Chad hurt me, yes, but, I don't know, looking back, I don't think he was the only reason. Maybe just the easiest excuse. My dad died when we were young, and when my mom got sick, well, I just... I just couldn't take another loss. So when Chad screwed me over, I took it as an opportunity. Go the big city, chase my dreams and... my mom was so proud of me making something of myself. But I convinced myself it was the right thing to do. The only problem was that... I left Paige here alone to pick up the pieces and never came back. [Instrumental music] You're here now. I was pushed here, kicking and screaming. Well, whatever the reason, I'm glad you're here. Me too. Hey, do you want to stay for dinner? Yes, I would love to. Great! - I'll cook. - Okay. [Both laughing] I actually said that? [Laughing] Oh, wow, that was incredible. Thank you for the wonderful meal and the great company. My pleasure. It's been a long time since I've been able to open up to someone. Me too. So, other than being a great listener and an incredible chef, do you have any other hidden talents that I don't know about? [Chuckles] Well, I do have some pretty good dance moves. I mean, not as fancy as yours, but... - What? - [Laughs] Saw you on the dance floor the other night. [Gasping] You did not?! [Chuckling] I was thinking you can teach me some of those steps, and we can enter the talent competition. - I am mortified. - [Laughs] Well, if you're not gonna show me your moves, why don't you let me lead. Madame, may I have this dance? [Piano music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [leaves rustling] You know, you have been smiling all morning. I take it the interview with Noah went well. He's easy to talk to. You mean interview? Yeah. It's what I said. Okay. But you are still going on a date with Chad? - It is not a date. - Right. He is just picking you up, taking you some place romantic... - Coffee. - Coffee can be romantic. Ah, it's not like that. We are just friends. And Noah? - Just friends. - Ah! A whole lot of friendship for a girl who had no friends in Greenville. - Do not start. - [Chuckling] Come on, Maggie, come give me a hug! I gotta go to work. I'm too busy right now. [Sighing] It's just a phase. Some phases last longer than others. [Instrumental music] Hey, kiddo. What are they doing? - Playing. - They're playing? - Yeah. - What game are they playing? - Hide and seek or tag? - Tag. Tag? [Katie] Do you remember that time you got your truck stuck in the mud hole? Ahhh... How could I forget? You were pushing, but I didn't know how to drive stick, so then you're behind the wheel and I was trying to push. And then our science teacher came by and saw us. - [Gasping] Mr. Bingham! - Yeah. Ohhh, he gave you the evil eye for the rest of that semester. He would never let me explain. Never. Wow! We've got some great history here, you and I. Yeah, we do. A lot of good memories. - More than the bad ones. - Mm-hmm. You've become an amazing woman. You got out of this town, you started a career, traveled the world. I'm... I'm... I'm jealous, yeah. Yeah, well, it's not always all it's cracked up to be. Besides, I'm starting to realize that there's a lot more to this town than I gave it credit for. You want to know what the best part of this town is? What? No matter where I go, I see memories of us. [Instrumental music] The school we used to go to, the coffee shop we hung out at after school... where the old drive-in used to be. [Laughing] I remember. So, you've been back in town a few days now, is it what you expected? Not really. How so? Everybody here's been so nice to me. Present company included, I hope? Yes, Chad. [Chuckles] Did you really think that people wouldn't be? Actually, I did. I thought people would resent me for leaving. It's a small town, everybody wants to leave when they're a kid. Not Paige, I mean she's always wanted to be here. Have a family, raise her kid in Greenville. We had that dream once, remember? Maybe you just need to ask yourself why you left in the first place. It wasn't all about you, Chad. - Oh, thank goodness. - Trust me. - You were part of it, but... - But what? I don't know, I was young and I hated it here. There was only just one store where you could buy new clothes and two restaurants that you could eat at. I can see how that could be annoying. Things have changed, and the restaurants here are amazing now, and you can buy almost anything you want online, so... So... you might come back to Greenville? My life in the city isn't perfect, but I do love it. What part isn't perfect? Seeing what Paige has, I guess it made me think. So, if you found the right guy, you might come back? [Instrumental music] I might. - Katie... - Yeah? I love you. Whoa! Chad, wait. What are you doing? I love you. I'm still in love with you. - Chad, that's crazy! - No. You just said if you found the right guy, you might come back, and when you said it, you smiled like you were thinking about somebody in particular and... I... I thought you were thinking about me. Chad... But you weren't, were you? Oh. No. Ahem! It's Noah, isn't it? Chad, I... I can't do this. [Instrumental music] I see you're wearing more sensible shoes. [Katie giggling] Yeah. I picked them up in town. Is Greenville rubbing off on you? - Maybe a little. - [Chuckling] So, have you decided what you're gonna make for the Best Dish in Greenville competition tomorrow night? I don't know, everybody's telling me to go with my pumpkin pie. Well, I am a big fan of your avocado toast as you know. [Chuckles] That's not exactly on my menu. I should try to be more impartial. I mean, I'm one of the judges. Well, I am the new restaurant in town. Maybe I could use a judge on the panel who thinks I'm good-looking and charming. Right, except for this judge also has a $300 blouse with a coffee stain on it because of you. Oh, well, this should make for an interesting competition. I promise I will be impartial. It's all I can ask for. But, um... your avocado toast has been one of the highlights of my trip so far. - Just one of them? - Yeah. It's been great. You know, reconnecting with my sister, the whole town really. Meeting you. It's been so long since I've been here that coming back made everything so different, yet familiar. Hard to explain, but I feel like... - Like it's home? - Yeah. [Instrumental music] And when I'm with you, I also feel like I'm home. You make me feel like I could be me, the real me, and that I could be honest with my true feelings. What are your true feelings? I, um... [cell phone ringing] [chuckles] Um, sorry, it's my sister. Hi. Oh! Nothing I can't continue. Oh, yeah, of course. I will be there. No problem. Okay, bye. I have to go, and you need to decide what you're gonna make. Okay. Well, I'll see you at the Harvest Festival then. - I wouldn't miss it. - Okay. [Crickets chirping] We're closed! - Chad. - Noah. Are you here to write another biased unfair article about my food? Hey, I stand by that review. I'm sure you do. No, I was just in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd pop in and try this avocado toast I've been hearing about. Avocado toast... Well, it's not really on the menu, so... That's strange. I was out on a date with Katie Taylor, and she said you made it for her. A date with Katie? Yeah. We used to date in high school. More than that, first loves actually, so... Right. I guess being back in town has rekindled certain relationships. Yeah, she wouldn't stop talking about how much she misses the big city though, can't wait to get back. She hated this town when she was in high school, and she says nothing's changed her mind since. Really? She said all of that. Yeah, yeah. Same claustrophobic town, same small main street same handful of... restaurants with untalented cooks. She said all of that to you? Yeah. Sometimes, you need to know someone for a long time to get the truth about how they feel... to get the honest truth about how they feel about certain things, and that some things and some people are just there to... To what, Chad? To make a good story, Noah. I wrote an article about it for the paper. I'm doing a whole series on the Harvest Festival. Got an early edition. Why don't you give it a read. Some tasty bits in there. Ooh, look at the time, I gotta go. Oh! We'll do your crunchy toasty thing another day. - Take care of yourself, Chad. - Yeah. You too. [Instrumental music] [door closing] [instrumental music] Tonight is the last night of the Harvest Festival, and we have one more restaurant to interview. Did you get plenty of photos to go with the story? Yeah, more than enough. Any of you wearing coveralls or cowboy boots? [Laughs] Not a chance. I bet you can't wait to get home to the lights of the city. Actually, it was a lot more fun than I thought it would be. Well, now, I really can't wait to read your article. Can't wait to finish writing it. Okay, gotta go, Willa. [Katie] Talk soon. - Bye. [Piano music] - Hey! - Hey. Good morning! Yeah. Is there something that I can get you? Noah, what's going on? I'm just surprised to see you is all. What are you talking about? I thought that this town would have gotten a little too claustrophobic for you by now. What?! Shouldn't you be back on a train to the big city? Well, you know what? I gotta go pick up some silly local ingredients, so... Noah, what are you talking about? ♪ Ghosts don't die ♪ There it is. Your words printed for everyone to read. ♪ Ghosts don't die ♪ Chad dropped it off last night. Chad? Yeah, he told me about your little date, and how you could open up to him about all the things that you couldn't tell the rest of us 'cause you didn't want to hurt our feelings. Noah, this is a work of fiction! I thought we really had something, Katie. ♪ You think you put it in the ground ♪ I think we do, too. ♪ Secrets talk at night ♪ I hope that makes a great addition to your article. ♪ You'll try to run away ♪ - I'll see you. - Noah... ♪ Ghosts don't die ♪♪ I mean, yeah. It's always been a family paper, but I've been running it for years. - Chad! - Ah! What?! I thought you had grown up, I thought you had changed... I'm sorry, Mr. Mason, I will buy you another one... But you are the same jealous jerk you were in high school! I take it you have some issues with some of the quotes I attributed to you in my article. "Quotes"? You mean lies. Katie, you hated this town, you always have. And you've only come back to look down on us. Katie, you're the one who hasn't changed. I'm a respectful member of this community, always have been; you're just the girl who left. You want a quote, Chad? - Sure. - I'll give you a quote. Cover your ears, Mr. Mason. [Inaudible] Hey, I can't print that, so... Yeah. [Door closing] Have you read it yet? Just finishing it now. It's all lies, all of it. "Boring. Never changing." Okay, that is not how I use those words. "Unsophisticated." I didn't even use that word! Well, this is a disaster. I'm sure you can fix this with Chad. Not that, this is gonna ruin my article in my paper if this gets out. And that's all you care about? - Well... - What about Noah? Aren't you at all concerned how this is going to make him feel? You need to tell him that this isn't true, that Chad lied. What's it matter? Some guy that I met a week ago by the way isn't gonna get me to change the way I live my life. Soon, I will be gone, back in the big city and I will never have to come back here again. Yep. Just like you to do that. - Paige, I... - Don't! This is what I've come to expect from you. When the going gets tough, Katie is nowhere to be found. - Paige... - Let me ask you something. And be honest. Did you want to come here for this story to come back to Greenville? I... - No. - "No." - I didn't think so. - Paige, I'm sorry. I just... Do you have any idea what I had to go through when mom got sick? When I had to take care of her alone? - I know, but I... - I needed my big sister... But she was too busy. Too busy to care. Paige, I cared. I just didn't... I swear, if you tell me that you cared too much... - I'm sorry. - "Sorry." [Sighing] Sometimes, the important stuff, it requires the most effort. - I know, I... [Paige] And sometimes... The most effort, it means the most hurt. When something is meaningful to you, it hurts when it's gone. I get why you want to leave, but I just wish that you wanted to stay more. Hey... One year at the festival, I ate so much pumpkin pie, I had to lie down in the back of my truck. I fell asleep. Nobody could find me for hours. You really should watch your cholesterol. It's a shame you have to go before the festival. One more interview and I'm off. What about who wins? I really gotta get back home. That's funny. I thought you were home. You know what I mean. Still... it's a shame to see you go. [Instrumental music] So, I take it you guys read the article about me in the paper. Came out this morning. Whole town knows what you think about Greenville. - You're from here. - Born and raised. I guess you got a little too big for a little town. We just thought that being from Greenville, you would have been raised a little better than that. Ouch. I guess it wouldn't help if I told you guys that it was all a lie. Is it? -Of course! I love this town. Why should we believe you and not the local paper? Because I didn't... I don't know. It's what we thought. So to end the interview, for the Harvest Festival, we'll be making our vegan mac and cheese. It's gonna knock this town's socks off, and we are finally gonna beat the Greenville Grill and their hamburger. Good luck. Hmmm... can I try this mac and cheese? [Both] No. [Instrumental music] Okay. [Man on radio] The Harvest Festival is tonight. The Best Dish in Greenville will be awarded, and we will see if a new champion is crowned. Tickets available at the door. We hope to see you all there. - Here you go. - Thank you. Next stop, the big city. You know, I'm leaving this place for the second time for almost the exact same reason. What's that? Heading to the big city to leave a mess that Chad made. It's funny, in life, people make a big decision because either they're being pushed away from something or they're being pulled into something. And the older you get, the more you realize that those things that push you away should never have been given that level of power. And what about the things that pull you in? Those are the important ones. Push and pull. Push and pull. Leaving your job because you hate your boss? Big deal, most people hate their bosses. Following a career path because you love what you do and you can't picture doing anything else. That's important at the end of the day. Leaving Greenville because you want to get away from Chad is something that's pushing you away. Ignore it and ignore Chad. And what about heading to the big city? If your job is something that you love, that's a pull, that's a good thing. You need to listen to the pull. If your job is where your heart is, then go to it. And if it's not? Well, I'm just an old man. [Instrumental music] - Hey, Frank. - Yeah, kiddo? Change of plans. I'm gonna follow my pull. Where to? Home. [Instrumental music] Katie? Paige. What are you doing here? I thought you'd left. I did, and I never should have left. Is this another one of your classic Katie apologies? It's not, Paige. You've always been the best little sister, and I should have been a better big sister. I'm sorry for always running away when things get tough. I am done running. From now on, I will be here, I will be here for birthdays and Christmases and maybe even Halloween. I'll be here for the good times and the bad ones. That sounds nice. Really, really nice. I love you. I love you too, Katie, and I knew you'd come back home. Me too. Just took me a little while to figure it out. Now please, tell me that your promise includes not running away from a certain smug yet pretty man. - I don't know. I... - I told you. It's the things that are hardest to do that... Are the most important. I remember. I have such a smart little sister. Now, go get Mr. Smutty. [Indistinct chattering] Oh, you're right, Smutty doesn't work. Mnm-mnm. [Indistinct speaking] Go get him. [Man on PA] I need your help in welcoming to the stage this year's contestants for the Best Dish in Greenville contest. Here they are, ladies and gentlemen! Let's welcome on up! And, ladies and gentlemen, I am so pleased to be able to announce this year's winner. Of the Best Dish in... Excuse me? - One sec. - Yes? Oh, Miss Taylor, is it? Should I continue or did you maybe, I don't know, want to come on up here and share some more negative thoughts about our town? - Yes, I would. Yes. - Excuse me? I really would. Um, yes, I do, and... But no, nothing negative. I, uh... I just want... I think we've all heard enough, Katie. Nobody wants to hear any more of what you have to say. I'd like to hear what she has to say. Thank you, Mrs. Carlisle. Chad, you're a liar. Everything you wrote in that article was lies. I didn't lie about anything. Everyone knows that you hate this town. It's why you left. Yes, Chad, that's why I left years ago. I was young, immature, scared. I wanted to see the world. But coming back home has changed everything. And we both know I love this town. So if you don't mind... By all means. I love this town. I love the people and the waterfront and the restaurants and yoga in the park. I love my family. I know when I left, I planned on never looking back. And yes, I was not happy about coming back to Greenville to write an article, but... it wasn't about the town. It was about me. I was afraid. I was afraid of facing my mistakes. I was afraid that everyone would resent me for leaving. But I was wrong. Everyone has been so wonderful. You opened your arms which opened my eyes to everything I've been missing. To people and connections and family. And love. You all opened my heart. And I'm sorry that you had to read such a horrible article about me. It's not how I feel. I ran away from this town once before for all the wrong reasons, and I'm not running anymore. I love this town, and I love you Noah James. Do you want to maybe say something or...? No. Not really. Are you sure? Because I kind of thought since I was up here professing my love that maybe you would want... [applause and cheering] [instrumental music] Alright. Okay. Well, okay. Now that we get that over with... whatever that was [laughter] It is time to get to the moment you've all been waiting for, the Best Dish in Greenville. - Good luck. - Thank you. Put your hands together for Mr. And Mrs. Carlisle and their caramel apple crunch! Let's hear it for them! [Crowd cheering] [instrumental music] I told you you should have entered the avocado toast. You know, maybe next year. - I'll be here. - [Laughs] Oh, my gosh, Katie! I cannot believe that you just said all of that in front of, well, everybody. I can't believe it either. Guess something just pulled me up there. Noah, I'm really sorry you didn't win tonight. Thank you, Paige. I'd say that I won the real prize tonight, but I've never been a fan of cheesy lines. Still sounds pretty sweet to me. So, Katie, what are you gonna do now? I don't know. I mean, the paper wants me to go to Thailand, but I think I might take a little break from the travel game, stick around for a while if you guys don't mind. We would love that. Hey, I could always use a hand at the restaurant. I will leave the cooking to you. Well, now that you have all this free time, what are you gonna do? Maybe this town has gotten big enough for two local papers.
