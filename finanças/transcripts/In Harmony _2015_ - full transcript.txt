IN HARMONY Thanks. Mayonnaise? You bought this off the boat? No, the fishmonger. Fish only come when Marc's here. By the way, Marc... I've rigged the boat with a strap on the mast. Come by whenever you want. To finish me off? Can you pass me some bread? So, girls, your new boss? Not too mean with you? Less than you. I'm mean? No, you're nuts, not mean. So it goes. - How do you say "nuts" in German? - We don't. It's pure Brittany. There's no translation. Thanks for your support all the time I was in the hospital. Seriously, it was a great help. Seriously. Thanks to you all. To Marc. Here's to you. You're sure you don't need my help? Yeah, I'm sure. I still get calls from owners. They don't know yet? Sure. But they want you, Marc. Wisieux... The guy schooling their horse is too on edge. Put him in a wheelchair, that'll calm him down. Call me, okay? I'll call you. Hello. - The door was open. - There's nothing to steal. My name is Florence Kernel. I'm a claims adjuster for the company that handled your insurance. I came to check the modifications are as planned. Coffee? I'd love one. Get yourself a cup, on the shelf near the CDs. Your colleague, who came to the hospital, blew smoke up my ass. I know. You scared him. Now you're home, I've taken over the claim. Excuse me a second. I know you declined our offer. We reviewed all the details and it's fair to say we underestimated some aspects. In that respect, you were right. Now we can make a better offer. As I'm sure my colleague told you, it's complicated by the producer of the film being German. He contests the manner in which you and the coordinator planned the stunt. Anyway... Our two companies agreed on a figure. What figure? 30 more. That makes 250. 250,000 euros. A lot of money. I won the lottery. Lucky me! I didn't say that. Practically. You want me to take it and not think twice. I lost my legs, not my mind. Tell your company to stop playing me. We released funds to begin the house adaptations, which we had no legal obligation to do. Mr. Guermont, I advise you not to wait too long. If you drag it out, we'll take this to court. Once proceedings have started, it's hard to rewind. You'll get no money for several years. Or even longer. That's not up to code. - Yes, it is. - No, it isn't. 80 centimeters. He'll catch on it every time and fall out. I wouldn't want you to end up like Mr. Ferrand. You don't know Mr. Ferrand? The guy in jail. He made a ramp not up to code. A disabled guy snagged on the bar, fell and died. Mr. Ferrand was sentenced to 5 years. With remission for good behavior, he's looking at 2 years. I'll give him your number when he gets out. Maybe you'll have work for him. How about we widen that gap? Hello. - The door was open. - There's nothing to steal. My name is Florence Kernel. Paris sent us on-set footage. - I'll take a look. - They want to move fast. We need to get the guy to sign. Or it'll cost us a fortune. - You mentioned ill-considered risks? - Not yet. He may not take the bait. He will. Scene 17/11, take 1, 3 cameras! - Go again? - Back up a bit. - Okay, Julien? - Great. - Cut! - Great job! Watch out. Not bad. He's earning his money. Othello. Then an explosion over there. You're hit. You fall and bring down Othello. Until I give the signal, stay down. Scene 17/12, take 1! Silence on set! Action! Tell him I'll mention the torn sail in the contract. Hold on. You Okay? - And you? - Sure. - You look worried. - I do? Your worry line's showing. - No. - It is. The way he talks about the pump, I begin to smell a rat. So I call Garland to see if he's heard anything about the guy in the region. And what did he say? Grégoire, finish that chapter. He said yes, the guy had been reported. Useful, having friends in the police. Instead of a claims adjuster, why didn't you marry a lady cop? Don't be silly. Somebody whose job is more fun. - I'm very happy with my adjuster. - Is that so? Just be you, don't change a thing. Don't accelerate. Relax. Let the weight go. Watch. Like a baby's hand. At the end, keep the second finger firm. From the top? Disunited! He's falling in. Push him out! Bring him over to me. Steady! Bring him here. Give me that. His shoulders. Shoulders first, then the hips. Right there. Look at me. Come here. Q.“ m“! Demand respect or he'll dominate. Morning, sir. Once you're in, I'll explain the various modifications. - There you have... - Don't bother. Wait! Wait for me! You need to do a test first. I have a license. I have to accompany you the first time. - Is that necessary? - It's one of my duties. Thank you. You had fun? To be absolutely honest, lots. I get the feeling you did too, a bit. The other day, you said you'd think about my offer. What you're offering won't last a lifetime. You have to look at the big picture. It's a lump sum so you can start over. Otherwise, you'll pay interest on a loan. I'll have to take out a loan? Yes. Generally, that's what people do. Trouble is, finding a bank to lend to you. You're in for a long wait. I know, so you said. Let's assume it takes ten years... Ten years at the very least. The company will argue ill-considered risks. Come again? It's alleged you took ill-considered risks on the stunt. When do stuntmen take ill-considered risks? I was doing my job. The assessors will arbitrate. All I'm saying is that your chances are not 100%. Miss... You went to business school, right? YES. They never taught you tenacity can be counter-productive. Mr. Guermont, you're in a wheelchair. Your stunt career is over. The doctors say you'll never ride again. Ms. Kernel, only I get to decide if I ride again. Sorry, you're T10 paraplegic. The experts all agree that no T10 paraplegic... Our Investigations people have information suggesting the guy can't afford legal proceedings. He has no assets, except for his premises, which are under mortgage, and his horse. Do you have more information? I doubt he can hold out. Good. We could begin by stopping all advance payments. - What do you think? - We could try another approach. I told Accounts that you would call them. In the recordings, did you notice anything that would support our arguments? No, not yet. Did you look carefully? I think so. Get him to sign fast. In any case, if it's dragging on like this, there must be something wrong. Most people sign faster. Last week, Nicolas here got a client to sign at the hospital. Without forcing him? Perhaps he needed to hear certain words. Perhaps you're not taking the right line. I believe I am. I don't know... How would you handle this claim, Nicolas? Let's say, if you were Florence. If I were as pretty as Florence, I think I'd try seduction. Good. Moving on to our next case... Vaquier. Now, Vaquier, if you remember... Antoine! Come in. Grab that rope, will you? On the stool. And hook it up there, please. Don't look so worried. The bank transfer... Which one? For your work with Othello. I insist. You work, I pay you. You paid me up for the first 3 months in hospital. So I owe you 2 months. I'll call the bank to wire it into your account. When the insurance pays what I'm owed, you'll get a raise. Your folks didn't send you to me to be exploited. Now, two legs less, twice the work. It's only logical. Stop it! Stop. Steady! - But you're polite. - Exactly. And generous. What about me? Very good question. You sell faucets Monday through Friday. - Need help? - I'd appreciate it. How's work? Fine. I have a great team. And you? Me? Same old, same old. The same old song. Happy birthday! Is it that many? Make a wish! Thank you. I have all I could wish for. Thank you. It's wonderful. You baked my favorite cake. What about the present? About time! My present. Hello. I'm here to see Mr. Guermont. - I'll get him. - Thanks. Marc, a lady to see you. Don't say you came to apologize. I'd be crushed. Why should I apologize? Your tone the other day. I brought you this. You've got it, but in a different recording. This one's better. It's the one I used when I was practicing. - You play piano? - Let's just say I did. You played this? You must've been really good. I planned to turn professional. Straight up? Sure, why is that surprising? Insurance is a surprising choice if you can be a pianist. Don't laugh. Music allows people to express things they can't say. It's a gift. Maybe. If you have things to say. Maybe that wasn't true in my case. Anyway, I flunked an exam and I realized that I wasn't cut out for it. You gave up music after flunking one exam? I have a good sense of reality. You don't do what you want in life, do you? YES. No. YES. You've never shown me your horse. I work on a claim that revolves around a horse. I see videos, photos... Never the real thing. I should warn you, he's a bit... He's not any old horse. Are they coming? No news for 3 days now. I call the contractor, leave messages. No answer. No, I've no idea. - You know anything about horses? - Not a bit. - Not scared, are you? - No. Come here, boy. This is Florence. She likes animals. You can say hello. C'mon, don't be shy. Don't be scared. He won't bite, see? That's right. Behind his ears, he likes that. Just like that. It's too intimate. Touch him. There, that'll do. Just a bit more. Give me your hand. There. - He doesn't like me one bit. - He does. Put your hand out. There you go. Steady, boy. Want to get on? Yes, you want to get on. You're dying to. So you're scared? No, I just don't want to. He wants you to. Look at him. I've never ridden. Just do what I say, which is not much. Let yourself go. If you can. Antoine! Bring a saddle for Othello, please. I lied. They freak me out, these things. This thing is a horse. Othello. Anyway, I guess you're well insured. I was waiting for that one. Nice and easy. Hands a little bit higher. Good. Sit up straight, shoulders back. Don't just let him stop. Use your leg, use your right leg. Your outside leg. That's not too bad. A little left hand. Close your hands. Take up the left rein, that's right. He senses your fear. Relax or you're headed for disaster. Make the most of it. What did you say? Shitbag! Be polite with the disabled. Screw that. Cut it out. A little piaffe, that's all. Stop it, dammit! When you stop being scared. What's that you say? I didn't say a word. But you thought it. I thought, asshole! There, now it's out. Enough. Don't give in to him. That's nothing. Steady, Othello. Sit up straight. Breathe. Grow on the horse. Feels good. Let yourself go. You Okay? Fine. - Couldn't you clear away your mess? - It was Manon, not me. Make an effort. Even if it's someone else's stuff. - You practiced piano? - I was waiting for you. Take some initiative. Don't always wait for me. It's cool. She'll do it now. Sorry, I'm tired. I was expecting you. I left you a message. I needed a few details before coming by. Come and look. There's a problem with your bank. They stopped transfer of two installments. For lack of funds. You're sure? That's why I came by. You understand, I can't work for free. I try to be flexible but... I understand, of course. I brought my invoice. It needs to be paid before we can resume work. - You checked? - We called the company. - What (“d they say'? - Funds have been blocked. What? A week or ten days ago. No way. You're kidding me. I have another call. Please hold. Scram. I want to be alone. Leave me alone with him. What? Othello? Antoine works him. Every day. He hasn't dropped weight again. Guess who called me two days ago. Wisieux. I told them you wouldn't ride again. But... They said if you work the horse on foot, that's fine by them. I mean... In your chair. What are you doing? Delachaux, officer of the court. May I? That's all I need. Thanks. A real pain all this stuff about choices. First choice, second choice... As if kids know what they want to do. She doesn't know? Sure, she wants to be a dancer. With that body, she's gonna... It's cool for other people's kids, but yours? You just hope she'll land a job. You'll know what's best for her when she has to choose? If she chose dancer without the physique, I'd try to dissuade her. BY Saying what? That nobody's happy struggling to make ends meet. Harsh reality. Let's gm! Dr. Louie's ward, please. Thanks. Afternoon, miss. I was calling for news of a patient. Room 1119. Okay. Compared to yesterday? No, don't say I called. I just wanted to see how he is. Thanks, bye. Are you okay? What are you doing? Nothing. Nothing? I was just calling the hospital for news of a client. Is he okay? He's getting better. I just wanted to say, in the opening passage of the allegro, there's a moment when the bass... becomes agitated. Thank you. Our turn now. What were you thinking of playing? Liszt, Etude no. 12. Child's play. There's no point losing our temper. Several remarks. You've definitely kept your musicality. It's astonishing to feel the presence of your musical sensitivity. But there's another aspect. Your body, your fingers... When you were in my class, how many hours a day did you practice? Eight hours. And since then? None. I stopped. We can't expect a miracle. When you're making these jumps with your hands... You see, it's off. There's something off. I wonder if it's something you never get back. You have a number for the assessor in the Guermont claim? Sorry? The guy who signed off on the injuries. Why? What's going on with Guermont? - Nicolas... - I meant to call you. Paris called and we had to make a decision fast. You always say decisions are made together. What do I do with a claim going nowhere and a guy taking advantage? Advantage of what? The fact that he's dealing with someone who's too nice. Florence, your methods work wonderfully. As I always say, being nice pays twice over. But, in some cases, they don't work. So we change up. Don't say that I didn't warn you. With Guermont, I asked you to reconsider your methods. Antoine? What have you done with Othello? I see. Yeah, good work. Hold on, Marc. You knew they'd try to take my horse? Yes, I knew. Sorry, I couldn't stop them. My assistant hid him at a friend's. I'll sign your stupid protocol. I tried to stick it out but you're too strong for me. "You"? Don't try to pretend. You lied! You, your company... I'm not handling the claim anymore. My colleague, Nicolas Roubiaud, will contact you shortly. Before you make up your mind, I'd suggest you call this person. A friend from college. She was always smarter than me. Tell her I sent you. It was a pleasure to have met you. They blocked the installments for the farm's modifications. - It's up to me to pay. - On what grounds? They say I took ill-considered risks. "Ill-considered risks"? That's the term they use? Did you contravene explicit orders not to do the stunt? Of course not. Were you informed in writing or before witnesses that the stunt was contrary to the producer's wishes? Are you kidding? So I don't see how they can claim ill-considered risks. It's nonsense. Or an attempt to intimidate you. - Did you sign anything? - I refused. Good. - Here you are. - Thanks, Jean. We'll file an injunction tomorrow. The fine increases daily. Your renovation will resume very fast. We got lucky, we have jurisprudence fresh out of the oven. It's a case where the judge took into account the prejudice incurred due to lost income. Here's a copy of his ruling. It even includes the impact on pensions. Now, let's crunch some numbers. I imagine you were good at your job. You were in demand as a stuntman? And trainer. Let's calculate lost income. If I accept the money, it means I can't work again? After we win, the money's yours, none of their business. Anyway, it won't be the same work. You'll do stunts again? What do you think? You do what you want with the money. If we can prove they put pressure on you, our case is stronger. Did you write down what Florence said? Actually, they often tape their conversations with claimants. All companies do it, for their files. You mean Florence was taping us? Everybody does it, not her specifically. Clearly, Florence must like you if she gave you my card. It's against the law. Insurers cannot recommend lawyers to their clients. Didn't you know? It's better that you know. Let's keep it discreet. Yeah, of course. Our secret. No, there. You know not to call me. I told you, I'm no longer handling your claim. You've done a lot for me. Your lawyer friend's great. To celebrate, maybe we could have dinner. - Thanks, but I can't. - Why not? My husband is out on business and I'm looking after the kids. I'd better go. Your friend told me that to convince the judge it would help if we could find a trace of what you said. What do you mean, a trace of what I said? The pressure that your company puts on victims like me. She said there must be evidence. Catherine, it's crazy, what you said to Marc Guermont! Who told you I could give him a recording? Good point, who told me? I don't know. Look, I don't know the guy, but he's the first claimant you sent me. I assume there's a reason behind it. A reason behind what? Nothing. I didn't mean that. What did you mean? It's your call. If there are tapes, they'd be a great help. You want me to take it and not think twice. I lost my legs, not my mind. Tell your company to stop playing me. We released funds to begin the house adaptations, which we had no legal obligation to do. I'll have to take out a loan? Yes. Generally, that's what people do. Trouble is, finding a bank to lend to you. - You're in for a long waif. - So you said. Hey, honey. You're not in bed? I wasn't sleepy. I told you I was going out? I'm going to bed. I'm beat. - Coming? - Be right there. It'll take longer than planned. I'll be home soon. Can you look after you brother? Love you. And a liter of diesel now? It's come down a notch. Costs me 1.22 at the pump. Now the competition's Portuguese. They didn't come this way before. Now they've depleted their stocks, they're here. And you, Florence, you're in insurance? Interesting? She doesn't work in insurance. Who told you that? I did. That's not her. Florence is a pianist. Florence Kernel... She's well-known. I bet you've heard her on the radio. What did you play last week in London live on air? You know... That was Liszt's Etude No. 12. See? It's her big hit. What are your favorite cities? The cities you enjoy playing in? Beijing- In Beijing, there's a magnificent new hall. Tokyo, too. It's too bright. Too harsh. For Bach, it's good. For the Romantics... Actually, the best is in America. You bet! - Carnegie Hall. - Right. All over, in fact. They built halls that are great for piano. There's Detroit, Los Angeles, Chicago... Even Atlanta. Atlanta is perfect for her playing style. It's nuts. What's your style? What's my style? Yeah, what's her style? Her style's... It's Florence Kernel! It's something that's both powerful and very gentle. The full range. And she's a risk-taker. Here... I changed my mind. I won't use it. Keep it. Just think... I'm thinking. The risks. Ill-considered risks? Take it back. I won't use it, I said. This just arrived from Ms. Kernel. Thank you. Morning, sir. Can I help? The controls... Throttle? And brake? Exactly. Both on the handlebars. On sand, what's its stability? It's the best on sand. I'll get a brochure with the details. Okay. Mathilde, can I have an X300 brochure? Here you go. I'll let you think it over. Well now? Still torn or minds made up? Five times today! What do I do now? Just imagine the damage! It's totally unethical. There's an injunction against us. Perfect spot for a quad here. Antoine, bring Othello so he can get used to it. Turns out, you know my wife. Florence Kernel, your claims adjuster. When I described you, she said she'd handled your claim. Not anymore unfortunately. They've given me a real jerk. She'd had enough anyway. She was looking for a way out. She resigned? They fired her. Out of the blue. Tricky, these firms. He's a beauty. A real beauty. One year later We have the Ferro, the Grosser and Pierre Vallaud. That's the most recent. One copy of each upstairs. Okay, thanks. Hey there. - Let's see your thumb. - Why? Show me. A blister! Too much remote. Some folks need amputations. First passage by this paraplegic rider, so impressive in qualifying. Marc Guermont on Othello, his Andalusian thoroughbred. Put that back on. - Put it back on. - It's horseriding. And now the piaffe. Followed by the Spanish walk. The horse stays light. It's performed with slight contact on the reins. Now the collected trot. And he'll move into... A half-pass on the diagonal. Passing in front of the judges again, before the next movement. You okay, mom? Sorry. I'm just going upstairs. Hello, you've reached Marc Guermont. After the beep, leave a message. All good. Good luck. Subtitles: Simon John Subtitling: C.M.C.
