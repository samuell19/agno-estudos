IN THE MEMORY OF THE PRODUCER, MAI MESHAL "WHAT IS LIFE? AN ILLUSION, A SHADOW, A STORY, LIFE IS BUT A DREAM" SPANISH POET CALDERÓN DE LA BARCA The first thing I ask myself when I wake up, "Is this a dream? Or is this real?" I've never been able to tell the difference. - TUESDAY - MARCH 30 - TH - 2021 - SHABAN 7 - TH - 1441 Real stays real only because we don't wake up. - Mr. Naeyr Mahfouz? - Yes. Get in. Do you know the address or should I use GPS? Somebody's supposed to send me the location. Use the location I sent you until then. Yes, sir. 1 DREAM It's just a dream. Just like the dreams I've been having for a few years now. Since I've decided to isolate myself. I'm better off without people. But I'm not better. I'm afraid to sleep. And I'm terrified to wake up. Weird that I call it dreams not nightmares, huh? Dreams come when I'm asleep. Unlike nightmares that haunt me when I'm awake. Good morning. Good morning. I thought I'd have to knock harder to wake you up, but you're up. Yes, I have some stuff to do. - How are you, Hanan? - Fine, thanks. I bet you have tons to do that's why you're up early. Right. Take care. Damn my rusty memory! I stayed up all night to fix it, I know you need it for your work. I catch it while it's flying! Here. I don't know what to say. - Hold on. - Okay. I would've thought you're a wanted man! Who told you to open them? Why are you afraid of the sun? Vampire-much? Okay, here's your phone. How much did it cost to fix mine? My late mother used to say that baking makes the place nice and worm. Just like the sun. Give it time to get into your home and you'll see the great difference. You know how hard it is for me to go out in the morning. But I couldn't wait until night. A new nightmare has been added to my list. One moment. VOICE RECORDING Wednesday, March 31th, Ali Mahran. Go on. The weird thing is, I didn't kill that man, I don't even know him. Then why are you so worried? Look, I want to sleep without waking up panicking like always. Do you really have to roll a cigarette in the session? Are you taking your medications? Well, I'm trying. This is wrong. I'm not supposed to tell you what to do and what not to do. But this will get us nowhere. Avoiding people, working only at night… and messing up your medication schedule. All this is setting us back, it'll get us nowhere. All of that has nothing to do with the dreams. I told you before, Ali, the first thing I need you to do when you wake up is to remind yourself that it was only a dream. Listen, Ali, let's try something different. Try to allow new people into your life. Know more people. How long since you've last seen your son? Visit your mother, Ali. Karim! Go sit down. Don't think that I'd miss you and hug you just because you were away for six months. I honestly no longer care about you. I think you do, Foffa, since you counted the days. Ali. Don't start now. Start what, man? We're just talking. You shut up. It's not about me, it's about kid. The more he's away from you, the more abnormal he'll get. Just like you. Oh, well, that's all thanks to you. But fix that mistake while raising him. - Do you still have doubts he isn't yours? - Mom! I told you to run a DNA test so you can be free of those obsessions. Wafaa, where are you going with this? You need to go back into rehab. Oh, well, listen, I can take the boy if he's causing you trouble. Take him where? To his mother? To your wife that left you. Ali, why are you here? I'll tell you. He's filing a case, probably about his wife that ran away. He's just shy to tell us. What? I don't get it. I told you to shut up! That was crystal, you animal! You really want to talk about this now, don't you? You haven't taken your medications for a few days, you haven't slept. You don't look fine. Look at yourself. Look at your clothes, your social scale has dropped. Don't think that I don't know how you've been living. But your brought that upon yourself. You insisted on marrying her. Now you pay for it, and don't make a fuss about it. Ali? Ali, don't mind her. You know how she is. Tell your Dr. Reem that I won't be going to therapy again. This was her suggestion. I have full custody! But I should visit my daughter once a week, and I will! - Whether you like it... - Mahmoud, hasn't this been solved? This is none of your business! This is between her and I, stay out of it. If I owe you something, come and get it! - And you, don't you trigger me... - What do you want, Mahmoud? - You're killing him, Ali. - You're killing him, Ali! You're killing him! The strangest kind of dreams is the continuous kind of dreams. As if I'm watching a movie, with little breaks of waking up. And until this day, the words "it's just a dream" are what kept me sane. But what I didn't know is, those words were turning into a mystery and creating my worst nightmare. Oh, no! Isn't this your crazy friend? Reject the call. Now focus. Just focus and stop acting like a chimney! Focus, please. For water to reach your tap from the great River Nile, it has to run in pipes, huge pipes. Now if we assume that laws are the pipes and people are the water, so people have to stay within those pipes. Any hole or any scratch… A big mess. Which flavor, Mother Milk or Milkman? That's a lot of milk! - I'm proud of it! - Shut up, idiot! I regret the time I wasted teaching you. An ostrich would've learned faster! Again, forget it. Just answer him already. Oh, Ali! What do you want? He wouldn't stop. Yes, Ali? Hi, Adel. Hi, man. I'm so busy now. What do you want? - Help. - What's wrong, Ali? Come now. What, now? I can't. Just tell me. Police! Break that door! What's going on in there, Ali? Ali? What is it? Damn you! Sir, none of this is real. We found this gun, sir. Ali! Oh, my God! Ali! Where are you taking him? He didn't do anything! Moments before death… you should see your whole life. The good days and the bad. My good deeds and sins. And after the show ends, everything else ends. Life isn't planned, organized, or even fair. A question that starts with "why" doesn't have a definitive answer. They've always said that everything is meant to be. But the truth is, everything is chaotic. I finished watching my life as if it was a dream. But who knows? We could wake up one moment and realize that for all those years, we've been dreaming. A one-day long dream, or even shorter. Hey, listen. There's been an incident today. A guy called Ali, he escaped from prison. There's a big mess. Get me everything on that incident. Okay. Bye. - Dr. Ziad. - Mr. Tawfiq. Very nice to meet you. - How can I help you? - Listen. We got orders to stop the work. - May I ask why? - What do you mean? Haven't you heard? The signal here is bad and there's no internet. Dr. Naeyr is dead. You mean murdered. So you do know. Well, you know better on this. In this line of work, people don't just die. Well, our people abroad, they invest people, not buildings, so they wouldn't leave you alone. I'm only the messenger. And I have two messages to deliver. The first one? One, you'll give me all the data, so I can send it to our guys. We didn't find anything on Dr. Naeyr's body. - And the second? - Don't be hasty. All in good time. I'll say everything. "And say, "Oh, Sun, Don't you dare rise Before a year has passed "Don't you dare rise sooner" As this night is a sweet loving night… What? What's wrong? What is it? You son of a bitch! Ziad? He was here! He… Bring him to me this second! I swear to God, since I've heard the news, I've been praying that you don't make this stupid mistake by coming here. I fainted then found myself in an ambulance. I didn't plan to escape or kill anyone! But you couldn't have done that alone. Who helped you, Ali? Who could it be? Do you really believe this nonsense? This is not nonsense, man. I know better than that. Listen, Ali, if you're planning on lying to me, please, tell me know while we're friends so I can get myself out of this. Because you have no idea how bad it looks for you! What are you saying? Haven't you chosen the other way? Why do you want my legal advice? Adel, I'm not here to explain myself. I need help. Listen, Ali, we've seen this movie before, the wrongfully accused guy and the brave friend who helps him. I don't do that. I couldn't even if I wanted to. I'm sorry, Ali. I'm really sorry, but you being here is too dangerous. And not just for you. I'm sorry. Yes? Ramzy, I have a tricky job for you. Consider it done. Hanan! Hey, Hanan! - Adel! Have you heard about Ali escaping? - Shush! What are you doing? Yes, I have. He told me you have a copy of the key to his place, right? So you met him? You talked to him? Oh, Hanan, please, I can't do this right now. I'll tell you everything. Now, go up and put his clothes and everything important in one bag. Okay, but I'm coming with. Are you kidding me? Do you think it's a picnic? Come on, Mr. Adel! Please! I beg you, I want to see him. Is this the time for this, really? Okay, Hanan, sure. But hurry up, please. Okay, then you take those, put them in my place. You want me to hurry up. Damn you! I found this letter on my doorstep. I thought it was from you. Turned out it was for you. Here. What's this? That's a quarter of Naeyr's ID. Keep looking, you'll find an address on a piece of paper. 13 SAEED STREET, HELIOPOLIS What's happening? Maybe someone is drawing you out to frame you. I've already been framed. - They could've just let me get hanged. - God forbid! I always catching while it's flying! I think they're trying to help you. Ali, whether they're trying to help you or frame you, you must keep your promise to me. - What promise? - He promised to marry me! - Say something, man. - Yes, sure. - You didn't get my medications? - What medications? I didn't know what to get so I left them all. Okay, well… So, won't you leave? Where would he go… Mr. Adel? You're good friends, aren't you? Would you really let him leave while he's wanted? That's exactly why he can't stay here, because he's a wanted man. It's dangerous to him and to us as well. Ali, it's like you're hiding in a police car, man! It's possible that they search my place, since I'm your lawyer and friend. Just don't say "friend"! I have a place where you can stay. Where, smarty-pants? - Is it by any chance your place? - Give us a ride and see for yourself. What if there is a roadblock? Come on, Ali. Let's go. Welcome. Get in. Not anybody is allowed here. You being here means that you mean a lot to me. But I still can't believe it. How couldn't you feel the wound in your back? Are those that important? Yes, of course, they calm me down. Don't worry, I'm an expert, you won't feel a thing. - You said you like this place, huh? - I love it. I was born here, I got married here and I said goodbye to my parents here. You can call it my memory box. When I got divorced, I thought I shouldn't create a bad memory. - That's so deep. - Don't underestimate me. I'm a bookworm! And I always watch American movies without any subtitles. You know, I used to love him. That's why I had his baby. When a woman wants to prove that she'll be with a man forever, she has his baby. I think you still love him. At least I thought so when I nearly killed him. I was worried about you. You know, I never wanted him to say that he loved me back. I just wanted a gesture of goodwill from him. And how would you tell if his will is good? You wouldn't. That's the thing about goodwill. Only days would tell. - Didn't feel a thing, huh? - Yes, thank you. Where have you learned how to do that? I was a nurse during the war. There was this officer, we fell madly in love. It was an amazing love story. What war? You believe just about anything, huh? I'm not even doing anything. It's like fixing a torn pair of pants. Pants? Why are you helping me, Hanan? Because I can't believe you'd kill. You didn't really kill Naeyr, right? I trust you. - As a gesture of goodwill? - Well, why else? I'll leave you to rest. Take care. Everything you need is here. How couldn't I notice? The same hesitation and the mixed feelings. And the same problem of telling the difference. Happy birthday, dear Rimo. I'm sorry I can't make it today. I'm sure Ali is with you. Well, have fun. You invited Omar too? Who else sent you happy-birthday messages? Here we go again. You're starting to love this song more than you love me. It was playing the first you said you loved me. Remember? It was playing during all of our nice memories. - Yes. - I think that's enough. I'm not a child, Roro. I won't overdose. You wouldn't, but you'd hallucinate. Let's have a baby. And I'm hallucinating? What wrong with that? Nothing, but I thought you'd say, "Let's get married," first. Would you have said, "Yes"? Listen, it's been a nice day, let's keep it that way, okay? Ali, I'm alone. I'm really alone. I'm afraid I wouldn't have kids after the one miscarriage I had. What do you mean alone? I'm here. I can't count on you. Oh, can't count on me. Well, let's get married. Okay. We just need a registrar and two witnesses. Not like that. You know what? Okay, let's. Okay. We don't know who lost more in that marriage. But what I do know is that we ran to our fates. And my fate was my enemy, an enemy that I don't know how to fight. An enemy I don't know what the worst it can do. But what I found out is, some people reached new levels of dirty. At the age of pandemics, and the diseases we hear about everyday in a new part of the world, I asked myself a question, is this God's punishment, or test? And soon, I got the answer, folks. Sure we all remember how shocked we were when we heard about Ali Abu Alwafa, who caused the death of a lot of innocent people. Today, in the early hours of morning, we woke up to a tragedy. A horrible crime. A crime at the hands of Dr. Ziad Salah. He's supposed to be a man of science. He killed his wife and kidnapped his daughter and vanished. We are the true disease, folks. More details are after the break. Stay tuned, we'll be right back to a Spot of Light. - Good evening. - Who are you? Do you know Dr. Naeyr, rest his soul? I said, who are you? Relax, please. This man is accused of killing Naeyr. He found your address and... What are you doing? We have to overpower her. What are you saying? I think she's calling the police. Why... If you really killed him, they'd thank me for killing you now. How did you know my address? One, your shaking hands suggest that you aren't a killer, so put the gun down before it gets ugly. Two, if your address and a quarter of Naeyr's ID ended up on his doorstep, then we should ask you, what do you have to do with it? She has a point. I told you, I always catch it while it's flying! Come. I also received this. That's the same ID number. See that we're in the same boat? My mother is sick, she can't even take her own medicine. I'm the only one she's got. We can't be in the same boat. What does this mean? It means that there are two other people have the rest of the ID. Go find them. I haven't slept since I heard about his murder. The gun hasn't left my side and I'm living on sedatives. CLOZAPEX Believe me, I'm the last person that could help you. I believe you, dear. Could you at least tell us what's your relation to Dr. Naeyr? - The you'll leave? - We will. I'm so sorry, Doctor, I'm late... You've got the highest grades in all of the tests you've had here. Do you know what's special about clever people like you? Doctor, it's my dream to work... That they learn from their mistakes. That's why they never make the same mistake twice. And over time, they always shine among their colleagues. That's why, Hend, you haven't been accepted. I hope that you'll learn from today's lesson. I wish you all the best in another company, where you can respect appointments more. - Hello? - Hi, Hend. - Who is this? - I'm Dr. Naeyr. Well, Doctor, you could've taught me that valuable lesson over the phone. It wasn't necessary for you to send for me just to reject me. I rejected you because you're so clever that I thought they didn't deserve you. Listen, I want you to work with me on a private, very important project. I couldn't find out more details about it, he was killed soon after. How could you do this? By the way, I didn't kill him. Even if you didn't, killing him is nothing compared to hiding his body in your place. What did you want by doing that? I didn't do anything. That was the first time I ever saw him, in my apartment. I only saw him in my dreams. In your dreams? Yes. Well, I invited you in because I thought you'd be able to answer my question. Who sent me this part of his ID? But since you're asking that same question and don't have the answer… I think it's better if you'd leave. - Thank you. Let's go, Hanan. - Okay. Tickets! Your ticket, sir. - Tickets? - You left them with me. Here. - Thanks. - Tickets? Tell me about those dreams of yours. I dreamt about everything that happened to Naeyr. Wow! That's a gift! I swear, you're gifted! - Would you lower your voice? - Mind your business, sir. Okay. You know that I catch it while it's flying. Mom used to say, "If you saw a dream and it comes true, then you have a gift." I mean, you could see something now or from the future. - What's this? - What? I used this cell the night of the accident. Remember? My cell broke and you gave me yours so I can work. I do remember. That's my last link to Naeyr. Oh, my God! It's a gift, I'm telling you! - Okay. - I'm telling you, it is! Hanan? Come, quickly. That's blood. Is it Naeyr's? If this place is real, then it wasn't a dream. I was there when Naeyr was killed. But I didn't kill him. What is this? It won't work, I think it needs to be fixed. Cheer up. God doesn't do harm. You're on the right path, and I'm with you. What you're saying is old and cliche. But when you say it, I feel like I'm hearing it for the first time. Maybe because I say it in the right time? - Maybe. - No, not maybe, it's for sure. Wait. Come on, up! - What do you want me to do? - Dance! Really dance! Truth be told Let go of your sadness's hold - And don't think - And don't think It's a nice day, be happy and be free And cheer up, dear Ali Show me your lovely smile, Ali Cheer up and be free, Ali What are you doing here? We have a problem. Hanan, listen to me! I'm not judging you on the men you bring home. I want you to take the girl and get out of there now! Don't go to your mother's house or even our place. I don't get it, how did they know? Even though I'm against everything you do, but this is the only solution. You have to get out of here, now. They cornered me. They thought it was my apartment. I told them that it wasn't, and that it was yours. I told them about your new place as well. Listen, I'll send you a location so you can bring me my kid, and then you go on your way. Put it in the bag, Leila. Mommy, what's wrong? Nothing, baby. Nothing's wrong. Oh, God. No! My baby! No, please! Shut up or I'll kill her. I will, but please, let her go. My baby! Please! - Where's your dad? - He's dead. We're all alone here, I swear. I'm sorry, I had to. It's okay, baby, we'll go to Daddy. What's wrong, Mommy? I'm sorry, baby, it's my fault. I'm sorry. - Have you heard anything? - No, I haven't. There's a man running, he went into the building. It's only me and my daughter here, we haven't heard anything. Okay. Thank you. I'll miss you, baby. No! I'll get her tomorrow, understood? We'll see. Come on. You've been followed, damnit! Go! Hanan! Get in, Hanan Bond, you action queen! That's what I get for helping kids! Ali? Can't you see that your every step now is implicating somebody innocent? - Don't you think this is enough? - I do. But what can I do? Turn yourself in. Don't mock me! I know it's harder now, but you got to see my point. Listen, Adel. - Just... - Get off your high horse. - What high horse? It's only right! - Right now, there's no right or wrong. Okay, relax. But if you asked for my help in another crazy situation, don't be mad of my reaction. And don't dare to tell me I'm wrong. I'm here for two questions. And you'll answer. Why so sure? I mean, I hope I can. Dr. Naeyr Mahfouz. God rest his soul. Sure. What was the nature of your work with him? Who gave you my office address? I was visiting Dr. Ziad's house… and your number was the last number dialed on his wife's cell… God rest her soul, too. God rest her soul. Listen, sir, I was Dr. Naeyr's lawyer, he was my client. That's it. And why would Naeyr, no offense, Mito, deal with such a low-profile lawyer? It was meant to be. It was meant to be! See that man over there? This is Wael. Wael has a gas tank. If you mince words one more time, Wael, too, will mince around this office that's filled with paper. And I promise you, neither Wael or I will leave until we make sure that the paper, the furniture, and you turn to ashes. Then I'll leave safely. I can't see anything safe about that! Listen, sir, Dr. Naeyr would've been wrong to work with a high-profile lawyer. It could've harmed him. He needed a… a talented person. A good, low-profile delivery man. What do you mean, talented? And what do you deliver? Talented in contracts. And delivering some money for some people, and to sign in his place. And by the way, they were mostly doctors. And I had to deliver the money personally, away from any bank transactions. We could've been watched. See how easy I am? I said everything. Unknown people, puzzles, contracts, agreements! Who were those people? I don't know them. But I have a list with their names and phone numbers. Where is it? No, sir! I swore an oath! These are my clients' secrets! I answered your questions about Dr. Naeyr and I answered. I can't give up other people's secrets. Wael, is this octane 92 or 95? Hey, what did I say? Maybe if I showed you how valuable the list is, you could appreciate it and reward me after getting it. I didn't even open it. Well… Fantastic! The reward, sir! Call it even? Why did you come back? We aren't done with you yet. I could report you and... Since you're that brave and you even bought a gun, then go through with that attitude. Where's your mother, by the way? Are you threatening me? You know that Naeyr was killed for a reason, and you could be killed for that same reason, right? Calm down, Ali. I already told you what I know. I met Naeyr. Virus synthesis? You mean biological weapons? It will be, if our work gets into the wrong hands. But it will protect the future if it doesn't. That last crisis has taught me that we should anticipate that happening again. The next time, it will be more ruthless and it will spread faster. It could even be synthetic. Well, Doctor, I don't believe in those conspiracy... It's lazy to believe that everything is a conspiracy. But it's also stupid to totally discard conspiracy theories. Yes, I was scared. But I was also excited, so I agreed to work with him. We were supposed to meet on March 30th. Before the accident. Who killed him, Hend? I should ask you this question. But you're the only one who can do what I want. No, Ali! Not my mom, Ali! Not my mother! No! You'll do everything I say, and I'll be right here with Mom until you're done. Excuse me, may I see Dr. Naeyr Mahfouz? Dr. Naeyr passed away. Oh, my God. Well, I'd like his address please, so I can go and offer my condolences. May I know who you are? Dr. Hend was a candidate to work here. Don't you know he was killed? Why are you asking about him? - 2019-SATURDAY - MARCH 30 - TH Why are you here now? You're cheating on me with Omar, Riham? My brother, you bitch! Ali! You're killing her! Naeyr was asking skillful doctors to work with him. It was a top-secret project. Dr. Hend and I were supposed to work on that project. - It was about... - No, stop, please. Excuse me, Doctor, would you please slow down a bit? I beg your pardon? Then why am I here, Dr. Hend? Not to explain Naeyr's project, that's for sure. You have the third quarter of his ID. So you must know something we don't. Hold on. I only came to know why I received a part of his ID. Dr. Hend, hello! Is Mr. Ali here? - Who are you? - Waleed. NAEYR MOHAMED ISMAIL MAHFOUZ ZAMALIK, CAIRO Perfect! I'm here to complete the puzzle. What if I told you that you'd all, very quietly, come with me, would anybody mind? - Yes, I would... - Mom! Don't worry about her. We'll send someone to take care of her. Well, you can change your clothes and get ready, because you'll meet her. - Who's her? - Yes, who will we meet? The woman who'll be in charge of you. Who are you? I'm the magician, who took you from your cell to the ambulance. Do you know how many died because of you? But you lived, Ali. Okay. Who do you with for? For you. Follow me. How did it go with the lawyer? I got a list from him with all the project's details, and the names of all the people involved. Death and I, we'll be visiting them soon. I need you to hurry. The more time passes, the more danger we'll be in. I have to travel fast. Our men abroad would cease to help if this went on any longer. Did you say, "I have to travel," or, "We have to travel"? I said, "Hurry!" Dr. Ghada, Dr. Naeyr's wife. What do you want from us? - Put out the cigarette, please, Waleed. - Sorry! No questions are allowed here. You're all mine here, because all of you owe me your lives. Each one of you, one way or another, would've been dead by now. Even you, Hanan. Even though you have nothing to do with this. But, well, you got involved. I know that you didn't kill Naeyr. But I can't prove your innocence. What am I doing here? Saving Naeyr's project. The project that got him killed. What do I have to do with it? When Naeyr was killed, when he was next to you, he had a flash memory, and they didn't find it on his body. Bring it to me and I'll get you out of the country like I got you out of jail. Protecting his project is the only thing that will make up for his death now, and save you. So, we're being kidnapped? Hend, Mostafa, you can go home if you think your homes are safe. Ali, Hanan, you should thank Waleed for agreeing to help us and providing this place. Please, make yourselves at home. Enjoy, everybody! You're not kidnapped. You can come and go as you please. But you will come. You now know the drill. I have no idea where Ziad is, I swear. All I know is what I saw on the news. He killed his wife and kidnapped his kid. The police can't find him, how can I? As for Dr. Naeyr, I swear to you, this is the first time I hear that he uploaded his work on a flash memory. I'm not a liar. I'm not lying. Well, I think we're done here? Yeah, we are. You'll leave? Oh, boy. You will leave. No, wait, I'll tell you. Please. Well… Well, I… How would I leave? This is my home. It's a nice home. But you'll leave it. Ask me, "How?" Ask me. Out of that balcony. - The balcony? - Yes. Say goodbye to Daddy. He'll be traveling. Go. Go! Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry I scared you. I'm sorry. Daddy is just playing dumb. He's trying to live past his time. And I don't have time. I appreciate how hard it is. I know that you both have suffered a lot until… God has blessed you with her. So count your blessings. Cover her eyes. Excuse me, ma'am. Ibrahim called me. What are you doing? Oh, God! - Do you even know who that is? - Who is he? The boy that works in my store. He fixed Naeyr's cell. We need to go. Okay. Take a sip! - What? - Take a sip! Stop it! Here, you take this, dear. Come on. Watch your hands! Excuse me, miss. This phone had a problem but I fixed it. The battery is dead now. I couldn't charge it, because you said you were in a hurry. That's okay, thanks, Ibrahim. Go home now. Ibrahim! Oh, my God! Ibrahim! - God! Come, now! - Oh, my God! - Come on! - Save him! - Get in, quickly. - Oh, no! Go, now! - Go! - Oh, my God! I have to charge the battery. Where's Ghada? We need a doctor. Dr. Ghada won't come until the flash memory is here, Ali. That poor boy didn't deserve this. This is not the time. We'll just sit back here? Don't worry, I'm fine. I'll be fine. What do you mean, fine? - I don't want to hear a beep! - What the hell are you saying? That boy is left for dead! - I'll go warn his mother, Ali! - You can't, Hanan! If you leave this place, don't come back. You've been burdening me enough. I'm a burden, Ali? Yes! Yes, you are! I think now is the time I should tell you why this song is so important to me. Whoa! Hey, what are you doing here? What's wrong? What is it? Goddamn you! Answer me! Hey! What are you doing? Get back inside! Sit down over there. Go, I'll be right back. Get inside! Sit down, I'll be right back! I don't have anything to drink. In fact, it's more than just a song. It's a gate to a parallel universe. For me, this song is the only beam of light that helps me see if it's a dream, fantasy or just a memory. The one thing in common among those three things is blood. Ali, what happened to you? You had a fever and you kept hallucinating. What did you see? I saw Adel. He has the flash memory. Call Hend, tell her to meet us at his place. Why do you need her? I'm here! Call Hend! You'll stay here. Ali! Could you at least tell me what you're looking for in my place? What have you got? Well, at least introduce me to this young lady out of courtesy. - Miss… - Dr. Hend. A doctor? Oh, wow. Nice to meet you. Ali! Ali, I really want to help you, but you're not helping me. Would you listen? There's no time to listen now. Ali, all the files are locked. Let me see, it was in my place. There's one file that's unlocked. It's a list of the people involved in the project. Well, what about Mostafa and Ghada? They should be on there! Mostafa was at the same interview I had. But Naeyr still continued his little play. I'm sorry to interrupt your conversation that I don't understand a word of, and I don't want to understand, I've just got to ask, Ali, Doctor, are you going to be long here? A text's been received now on his cell, with a location from March 30th. The night of the accident. From a Ziad Salah? Ziad Salah? I think I saw his name on the list. There. Adel, I didn't come here. Give me the flash memory. Hurry, Hend. Put this one back. - What the hell, man? - Ali, where are you going? To this location. Give me your car keys and gun. "Gun"? This young lady has a gun? Wow! Whoa! Oh, my good God. Doctor, hey, calm down. Calm down and make yourself a drink until I get dressed to drive you. He's got your car. I don't get anything. Okay, listen, Doctor. So that we're… clear and direct. This is Dr. Reem El-Gebely's card. Ali's therapist. I already told her about you. Go ahead and contact her so you can understand everything. You both are doctors, you can figure it out. Why do I have to call Reem? Why can't you just tell me? Well, these aren't my secrets, I can't talk about them. So, that means you have a secret of your own? At first, I diagnosed him with one of the common disorders. But as our sessions went on, I saw that his disorder was strange. I'd never seen it before. With symptoms like schizophrenia. Hallucinations that make him see stuff that aren't real. His second victim was his wife, Riham. Who was his first victim? His mother. He alleged she had been in many relationships. That he'd seen her with more than one man as a kid. Then he hallucinated that his wife was cheating on him. His therapist before me couldn't control his condition. Ali wasn't taking his medications. So his condition progressed strangely. Specifically, on March 30th, three years ago. His hallucinations increased, and his case grew stranger. He believed that his wife was cheating on him with his brother. The next day, she vanished. - He killed her? - She just vanished. After that, I took his case. I noticed that he forgets everything that happens on March 30th. Until the surprise. On March 30th of the following year, he came to me, broken-down, and he remembered everything. He confessed that he killed his wife. He tried to kill himself, but we saved him. And as usual, he forgot all about it the next day. Even his suicide attempt. So anything that happens to him on that day he turns it into one of his dreams? Dr. Hend, why do you think I'd tell you a patient's secrets? Ali! Oh, Ali! Ali, dear Ali Ali, who honked the horn Come out, Lolo, it's over. We found the flash memory. Your part is done. Yes, attaboy... You want to kill me, Ali? Trying to kill me instead of thanking me? You would've been hanging from a noose now if it weren't for us. Kill me? Be grateful! Put it down. Drop it. Do it. You're the last one on my list. And, of course, we save the best… for last! Ali's been fighting his memories with hallucinations and dreams for years. All three are mixed together in one box. A locked box that only opens up on March 30th every year. Only then, he can set them apart. And the next day, the box locks itself again until the next year. Where's the key to that box? I still don't know. It could be a situation that reminds him of what happened, a sentence, or even a song. I noticed there's one song that affects him in a strange way. The question now is, do you want to be one of his dreams? Yeah! You worthless ignorant If you think you matter, then what am I? …You're too old and too vain I have a good heart that can maintain you …I never miss …My bullet can kill Wait. Hey, stop. Let me see who's out there. Go. Oh, my! Mr. Tawfiq? I thought we could catch the live show. They cut way too much in montage. Oh, really? - I got an exclusive piece of news for you. - What? The next episode will be my last before I travel. You don't say! You'll really leave? I should've traveled sooner. But because I'm counting on idiots, I had to finish my own business. I have no time. Where's the flash memory? And don't act like you don't know, it'd be a cliche. I agree, I, too, don't like those cliches. That's why I'll say, yes. My answer is, yes, I have the flash memory. Well, seems like we'll have a blast here. So, will you give it to me? The answer is, no. Oh, now we're back to cliches. On the contrary! If I told you anything else now, it'd be a very short, silly episode. By the way, you're not creative. I'm not creative? Too bad. Why would you say that? Because I bet you'll turn up the TV now and order those fine men to beat me up. Am I right? No, you wouldn't do that, would you? Change it a little at least. Tawfiq Suliman will do this every episode… Don't move! Stop! Who are you? - Who are you? - I'm Ziad. You were firing that gun upstairs, right? How come nobody found you hiding here? Because… - Spill it! - I will! Don't kill me. I won't kill you. I wouldn't waste my last bullet on you. But you'll talk. Corruption… No creativity whatsoever, you bastards! Give me a chance to hit you back at least! Enough! Naeyr, God rest his soul, and I started this project without support. Until Tawfiq Suliman came into the picture and he told us that… there are some civil right organizations that are interested in our work. All that turned out to be a camouflage. And Tawfiq Suliman turned out to be… representing terrorist organizations. When Naeyr knew the truth, he continued his work, but he put together a secret team of his own. Until Tawfiq Suliman found out. Freaking bastards! Do you know, young thing, that I'm a big fan of your videos that you post? How about I shoot your next video myself? It's in the office. Whoa! Why are you so easy? Yes, that's right. And to be safer, I used to, regularly, change the places where the team used to work. And Dr. Naeyr, God rest his soul, was supposed to come to the new place. That's the warehouse upstairs. But he didn't show up, he disappeared. Then Dr. Tawfiq told me that he was killed. Naeyr was one step ahead, he divided the project into two parts. One on the flash memory with his wife, and that part is useless anyway. Why? Because catching a virus is for free. Well, call Ramzy and cancel everything. Where's the flash memory that has the cure? I don't know! No one does! That's why they kidnapped my daughter and killed my wife. Sorry, Mr. Adel. I wouldn't be able to kill you and your friend today. - Why? - Some other time for sure. Soon. See? Not a cliche, huh? Hey, listen, give my regards to your mother. Let's go. Oh, if you can't beat them, enjoy them. Adel, baby! Are you worried, silly? I'm fine. What about calling an ambulance, instead of all that kissing? Listen, Ali. You killed my most valuable man. I could've killed your friend, but I didn't. Let me put my cards on the table. Ghada isn't Dr. Naeyr wife. Yes, Dr. Mostafa is Naeyr's colleague, but he isn't his loyal friend. I directed that play you've been in for a few days now. Ghada and Mostafa have finished their roles. First things first. You located Ziad before I do, well done. But I could locate Hanan. Well done me! You'll receive a video now. My baby girl, Ali, please take care of Leila. I beg you! I couldn't let Ramzy's death slide. And now, Hanan's part is also over. If I didn't get that second flash memory, the ending for your mother and son wouldn't be happy as well. Those sad plays tend to leave viewers heartbroken, but they never forget them. Hanan was killed because of you. You lied to me! Dr. Reem told me everything about your wife. What are you doing? Ali, go to your room. Why are you here now? You're cheating on me with Omar, Riham? My brother, you bitch! What are you talking about, Ali? I'm alone! Wake up! Ali! No! - Ziad… - What? Ziad… The second part. What did you see? What? You left Hanan to die and you have the other part! I left my wife and daughter to die so I can live. Did you expect I'd care about someone I don't know? You're an idiot! You're the most stupid person alive! You stay here. 1 BLOOD - Farah? - Who's Farah? Do you know her? That's Dr. Naeyr's wife. The real wife! Don't stare at me like this. This is the final act of the play. That's it, we're done. Finito! That's why Dr. Naeyr didn't want her in the team. I chose to be in Tawfiq's team. I set the trap, and you walked right into it. Next year on March 30th, you'll find out more and more. Surprises. What if Naeyr didn't ride with me? I wish! I wish Naeyr was still alive to witness my success. He would've realized than I'm smarter than his whole team combined. Nothing is ever a coincidence. It's a choice. And everyone should pay for their choices. You either live like Tawfiq, or die like Naeyr. The flash memory, please. Where's Hanan's body? She's buried now, don't worry about that. Just like you buried your missus' body. Give me the flash memory. Come on. "And say, "Oh, Sun, Don't you dare rise…" Oh, Tawfiq's told me something very important. What? - Give me the gun. - Great. What? Mariam! Bring me Hend. I know she's in the car. No. Hend wasn't part of our deal. Our deal was Naeyr's project. Hend is part of the deal. Go get her so we can get this over with. Go! Go! Don't be afraid, Mariam. Hend, get out of the car. I said, out. I was one step ahead of even this. Loser. What did you inject me with? Does this cause hallucinations? Well done. You wouldn't like what you'll find out, Ali. At first, I thought it was a coincidence. But actually, Farah made me realize something before she died. I don't want to die, Ali. I don't want to die now. Untie me! It's too tight, I can't breathe. Why was Dr. Naeyr killed on March 30th, the day you know that I think all of its events are just a dream? It's not a coincidence, is it? Of course it isn't. Did you really have to take that flash memory? Ali! They'll kill him, Ali! Take the knife from them! It wasn't his fault. There's blood everywhere. Take the knife away from them, Ali. Of course, I will. I'll take the knife away from them. But tell me, who do you work for? Untie me, Ali. - Untie me... - Who do you work for? An international organization… that mobilizes patients to work for it. Each patient according to their condition. And I was the perfect condition. How did you find me? Better yet, how did you find me? There's fire. Everything is on fire. The fire, can you see it? You can see it, right? There's fire everywhere. It's everywhere. Can you see it, Ali? That's why I came. I came to enjoy every step that brings me closer. I came knowing that if I heard that song again, I'd see the truth with nothing to fear. I tried so hard to love you. I was shutting out all of my bad thoughts about you. I kept telling myself we were brothers, maybe I was being unfair. When I asked you to run the DNA test and you agreed, I thought I was wrong. I only came to prove that you were crazy. Do you know what the results were? The DNA test confirmed that Ali and Omar are in fact brothers. But they're only half brothers. When Cain killed Abel, he spent years trying to figure out what to do with his body. Until he saw a raven burying another. And he found the answer. Want to see the two ravens that held my answer? This is Naeyr's cell, and this is Hanan's cell that I had on the day of the accident. Naeyr requested a car and I received that request. It didn't matter if he'd made 20 requests, I would've still received them. These two cells are connected by some fake application. To make sure our paths would cross. That's no coincidence. Who do you think did that, Omar? My baby girl, Ali! Please take care of Leila. I beg you! Who broke my phone and made it look like an accident a day before what happened, so that I'd be working with Hanan's cell, with your fake application that night? Who had a spare key to my apartment to dump Naeyr's body? - Thank you. Bye. - You're welcome. How did you know the police were on their way? Omar, we have a problem. Mahmoud called and said that the police were on the move. Okay, you have to get out of there. I'll help Ali. He can't get arrested. Who gave my mother Dr. Reem's number so that... Enough talking. Yes, I'm the villain at the end of a movie. Good job. But your mother had nothing to do with this. Cheating on my father wasn't her mistake. Her mistake was having you. Ali wanted to prove that Omar isn't his brother. So, he has no right to any of his inheritances. You're suing me so that I won't get Dad's inheritance. You're saying that I'm the mistake? What does that make you? By the way, you're not doing this only because I'm suing you. Riham. Now I know that she never cheated on me. It's you who wanted her. Yes, I loved her. I could've protected her from you. But you killed her. She didn't deserve to die, you did. Okay, I deserve to die. Go ahead. Come on, you still have a chance. Why were you so scared? You thought we'd kill you for real? You did kill lbrahim for real. Omar's shot in the arm wasn't part of the deal, too. Those things make it look real. Okay, now our parts are over. Anything else? Dr. Farah will call you to give you your shares. Then you disappear. If I ever see any of you, that little play we just did will be for real. Untie me, Omar. Today's virus, folks, is rumors. Rumors! And who knows? Maybe the next pandemic that will sweep over humanity will be not physical, but psychological. Stay tuned, folks. We will be back after this break. Please, Ali, don't. You love her? - Do you love her? - Yes, I do. One bullet started it all. After reaching the end of this journey, I discovered that I still can't tell. Did that bullet hit Naeyr… or did it hit me?
