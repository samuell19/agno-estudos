Mama! - Jeanne, honey! It's already 6 PM. - What? You didn't wake me up. Come on! Breakfast ready! based on a true story Come on, honey. And so. Safe and sound. One for my girl. One for me. One for your father. Mama... He helped out anyway. Not my vibrator. Unfortunately not. Hey, Jeannette! We see your panties! Honey! Don't call me that in public. Sorry. Your lunch box. Will it go? Let's go. Mommy ... Wait! Oops, sorry. - Pardon. - Do not look. Calm down, I haven't seen anything. Who are you? My name is Marc. The new operational director. And you? You weren't at the round of proposals. I was sick. I could not come. But I'm briefed. Everyone knows me. I have grew up here since childhood. What is it? Are you afraid? Many people think that women cannot work, that they are more vulnerable. But not me. Sorry. I want to pass. Thanks. Wait, I don't know your name. Is That The Move It? Yes, everyone throws up. Do you want one? That is then four euros. Don't shoot your eyes. Don't injure your eyes. Jeanne. Jeanne! That's your name, isn't it? Are you waiting for the bus? I can give you a lift. Come on. You have to wait for hours. Sorry, it's a mess. How was your first day in the park? Beep, beep, beep. This is Jeanne's voicemail. Say something. Hello, Jeanne. This is Marc. Weird, I can't talk to you. Are you there? Jeanne. Hey. Is someone there? Hello, hello, Jeanne. So you can smile. What are you early. Who gave you a ride? - Do you have a new friend yet? - I'm going to sleep. Wait, Jeanne. Say something. Jeanne. Jeanne. Jeanne. Don't say I didn't wake you. Jeanne! Yes? So you are still alive. Are you coming for breakfast? Is someone there? If it's a joke, it's not funny. Hey! You don't have to hide. I'm afraid. This is stupid, Jeanne. I have a surprise. Not necessary. Come on. I saw you walk by. Surprise. Hello. Everything good? Come on. - What is this? - What? What is Marc doing in the living room? He's my boss. Your boss? Is he your boss? Hold on, this is no fun. You can't sleep with him. You're crazy. He is for you. And those grapes? What should I say? "Nice, grapes. But go away." Shall I arrange it for you? - No, don't do anything. - I'll go. Bye. No, no, stay. It's nice to have you here. Right? You don't screw her tonight, but that doesn't matter. Calm down, just kidding. He got it. She's ... funny. You don't know her. That disco ball is probably not ordinary lighting. Do you want to eat something? Something other than your grapes? Yes. What is this? Destination happiness. One day I'm leaving here. Do not mind me. Oh, found it. So that disco ball works, huh? Marc. Yes? Ever had feelings for an object? What do you mean? I do not know. When you touch them or something. That you then feel something. Understand certain things. Things you don't understand otherwise or does not know. No not really. That makes me think about something my mother said. Don't laugh at me, huh? She said... "Inanimate objects, do you have a soul that attaches itself to ours and forces it to feel love? " Something like that. Inanimate objects, do you have a soul ... that attaches itself... to ours... and forces it to feel love? They're great, aren't they? Yeah well. Look. Did you make that yourself? Yes. I check out the attractions ... and then ... I don't know ... Then I let my imagination work. They look like machines, but ... if you look closely, changes their shape. And then they take you along. A bit like us. More complicated than you think. Very nice. Thank you. And that's Jumbo, but ... it is not finished yet. - You mean the Move It? - Yes. That is the most beautiful. I love it that the park placed it. Have you ever thought about the competition? - Which competition? - Employee of the year. I think you could win. You take good care of the machines. We are similar in that. - Yes? - We share the love for those beasts. The only place where you have freedom to scream. Up there you can do what you want. Magic. Well? Shall I sign you in? - What? - Nothing. I like you. Inanimate objects, do you have a soul who attaches itself to ours and forces it to feel love? Hey. Can I call you Jumbo? I like to name newcomers. And "Move It" doesn't suit you. How annoying she is. Leave me alone. Honey, with Mommy. Will you call me back? Mommy, help. Help! Is someone there? Was that you? Jumbo? Jumbo? Jumbo? Again. Wait. Wait. I do not get it. What should I do? Jumbo, wait. Wait. I have a proposal. I ask the questions. Red for ... No. And green for yes. Okay? Jumbo. Do you want to do something for me? I am not like my mother. No nasty surprises. Good. Can we... go for a ride? Good evening. You talk differently than we do. Where are you from? I don't remember that myself, you know. Is he saying "you" now? You're not young anymore but the best looking. What will it be? Coffee. And next to it, blond or brown? Redhead? Just kidding. Only coffee. We're having a good time, right? What does that mean? "Yes"? Can I introduce you to someone? I want to talk about someone. Someone who is different. So that you give your opinion. My opinion. Mom. Is it Marc? Hey? Is there anybody else? Do you want me to show you? Jeanne? - Jeanne. - I'm here. - Everything good? - Yes, with you too? And? Where's that yummy thing? - Here. - Where? - No, not here. - Stop it, I'm serious. He is here. Come sit down. Did you love Daddy? Unfortunately yes. And did he love you? No. He never loved us. Especially when he ... Why do you ask me that? No reason. I love you. Come over to mom. His name is Jumbo, Mom. What? Big ears? Isn't that why you dared to say it? - You don't know how ... - Mom! It's not about sex ... It is something else. It is... - How do I say that? - Where's the boy? If I don't like something, they are cowards. Come on. Normally this is not allowed, but if nobody sees it ... - I don't want this. - Come on. No, please. I do not like this. Trust me. Come on, Jumbo. Show her. Jeanne, that's enough. I think it's serious, Mom. What is this now? What am I doing here and where is this boy? No, Jeanne! Do you like it? Sky. Jeanne! It's beautiful, isn't it? Mama, do you see how it moves? Come on, Jumbo! To turn! Jumbo? - Jeanne! - This is the one. Jeanne! Show her, Jumbo! Faster! Come on! Jeanne! Show it! What the hell is this? Jeanne! This is not funny! Stop! Jeanne, stop that thing! Jeanne! Mom. Mom. You're going the wrong way. Shut up! Are you kidding me? Can we talk? Do not worry. It will all work out in the end. Stop. Hey. With Jeanne. What are you doing? Shall I wait for you? No, I took the first bus. We agreed. I'm sorry. All right then. - See you tomorrow. - Yes. And forces it to feel love. That itches, huh. It is not aggressive at all. It is simple and does not hurt. May I? What? Sit next to you. Honey? I thought you were already gone. Sorry. This is Hubert. He won't let go of me anymore. Your mom is really great. Do you hear that, honey? Sexy and sweet, that exists. Nice to meet you. Hubert. Hubert. Do not worry, she is a little bit shy. The doctors say that's normal, that she is a bit strange. But normal my daughter is not now either. Jeanne, where are you going? Jeanne. I'll be right back. Jeanne. It's just a man, though. He's giving me orgasms, that's nice. I am talking to you. What are you doing, mama? No idea. But what are you doing? - The same as you. - And that is? I also had one with Jumbo. A what? An orgasm. Mom. - It is love. - This beats everything. Let me explain. Quiet. Quiet. Let me go. It is not my fault. Okay? He just makes me happy. That's all. I didn't ask for it. It's just like that. I just want you to understand that you listen. Ok I'll try. I'm listening. Tell. Come on, explain. Do the vibrations excite you? What is it? Lubricate your parts and will you let go? Does that slide better or what? Why are you so mean? You can get a short circuit. Because if you really get wet, he can rust. Do you know? You're just like Daddy. Get out of my house. Get out of my house. I do not want to see you anymore. Get out! I do not want to see you anymore. And don't come back before you put that out of your head! Mom! What is it? Mom! Ho, are you okay? Jeanne. What is it? Sorry. Wait, damn it. - What is it? Are you avoiding me? - I said sorry anyway. We don't see each other again. Have I not been proper? I do not want to talk to you. Tell me what's up. Jeanne. Please. Are you okay? - Is my mom sending you? - No. Did she call you? Did she call? No, no. Jeanne, I ... And it doesn't rust, by the way. - Just tell my mom that. - Why that? - Where are you going? - Lubricate things. - Are you okay? - Yes. What do you want? Where are you going? Don't touch me! - Is everything alright? - Yes. Hey. Jeanne, stop there! Now! What is she doing? Backwards! Will, stop it! I will. Jeanne! Get rid of it immediately! I'm already giving it back. You don't have to get angry. - Sir! - Can we go again? Let the people out. And I would kick shit? Okay, it's fixed. We are sorry. What is it with your daughter? Is she sick? She will come back again. Always. When my wife and daughter left, the little one has come back. On her own. Do you come? Why did you break everything? Are you insane? Why did you break everything? - Let me go! - Does it hurt? - Does it hurt? - Let me go. You are insane. Why did you do that? What did he do to you? Say what he did. What did he do? Quiet! Calm down now! Say it! Nothing! What could he do? That thing doesn't exist. Yes, mama. Yes. No. He does not exist. Jeanne. I can help you get better. We find a solution together. I'm here. I'm real. I spoke to doctors. They can help us. Let me go, you hurt me. Jeanne! Here. Does this not exist? That is not the same. Isn't it real? Don't you feel it? It's cold, it's warm, it is hard, it is smooth. Whatever you want. But it does exist. And it is beautiful. I have never felt this before. For nobody. What if it isn't love? What is it? He makes me feel things, mama. The way you want me to be with boys. Don't cry, mama. Look. Hush, I don't want to. I do not want. Are you listening or not? I want to put you out of my mind. I want to listen to the radio. Isn't that allowed? Stop. Stop! You are annoying! Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Why don't you stop? No, no interest. Just talk, I don't want you anymore. Why don't you stop? I'm tired! Do you hear me? I want to put you out of my mind. I want to put you out of my mind. Stop. Is someone there? Is someone there? Jeanne. What are you doing? Come in quickly. - You will recover from this. - I do not understand. It was everywhere. Everywhere, I swear. You're lucky I was there tonight. I do not understand. Does it contain liquor? A little. Put on something else. You will catch cold. I'm going to check tomorrow. You couldn't see anything with the rain. Are you changing? You really don't want to turn around? Is it like this? Do you like it? Yes. Yes. I don't want to marry you. What did you say? I don't want to marry you. Maybe we could fuck again first. Jeanne. Jeanne. Jumbo. Jumbo. No no no... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm here. Say something. Say something. Jumbo. Please say something. Jumbo, come back. Don't leave me alone with them. Don't leave me alone with them. Jumbo. Do not leave me alone. Please. Do not leave me alone. Do not leave me. Come on, Jumbo. I love you. I don't care about him. I love you. I promise. Is someone there? Is someone there? Do you like that? You make fun of me or are you sick in your head? I'm not making fun of you. Great joke, though. Yes... Jumbo yes yes, Jumbo like that... Jumbo, I love you. Oh, I love you, Jumbo. Is it like this? And what should I have done? Accept that you are next to it doing something insane with that thing? Come on, Jeanne. Explain it. Say something, because I don't think I understand. Say something damn it! We're already friends, right? We are not. Do you fuck with your friends? Well then. I am not doing it on purpose. It's a mess. That damn thing only costs money. Damn. Have it checked. You are not sane. Maybe you should open your eyes. Hello. Hello. Who is this? Hey? Jeanne? Jeanne, is that you? I hate you. Jeanne? I hate you. Do you want to talk about it? Good evening. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our party at the end of the season. Like every year we open our doors to our family and we ensure entertainment goes hand in hand with... - Security! - Yes, exactly. Nice that you clap, but... I think most of you soon want to eat. And especially to the drinks. Hey, Fabrice? I can see it in you. Maybe you already have something on. It does not matter. But before we go to the buffet, it is of course my duty to announce the winner. Ladies and gentlemen... We don't wait any longer. Happy applause for... Jeanne Tantois! Employee of the year. Jeanne, come on stage with me. Applause, please. Cheer for her. - Just like a Christmas tree. - Look. Bravo, Jeanne. I am handing you over the diploma "Employee of the Year" and a check. What are you doing? Wait. Sorry, I want to say something else. As you know we have had for a year a new attraction. The Move It. And what an attraction. But what you don't know, is that despite all our efforts, all your efforts, too few people enjoyed it. So unfortunately I have to announce you that as soon as it is packed for the winter the Move It definitely leaves us. To a new home. But it is not my fault if you prefer sitting in front of the TV. Jeanne. It is for your good. It has to. Jeanne. Calm down. It's sold. Calm down. I suggest you ... Do you open? Destination happiness What are you doing here? - Is Jeanne at home? - You shouldn't have come. - Is it going better? - Not yet. They are going to disassemble it the day after tomorrow. Finally she understands that it is best. How would people react? But we keep it a secret. Why isn't she in a madhouse? Couldn't you leave her alone? How dare you come here after what you did to her? Get out. He's just trying to help. What does it matter that she loves him if that makes her happy? Yeah it's weird but it's her thing. She doesn't hurt anyone? Well then. Go away, you. - Piss off! - Okay okay. Calm down. What is this? You don't know what you're talking about. Don't think I'm crazy. What's next? Have her locked up like that moron said? Now I understand why everyone is leaving you. Is it my fault she's crazy? I need her to be humiliated by everyone? Do you think it'll fix that? A broken heart does heal. - That is nothing. - Oh no? Are you over your ex then? Yes. Hubert, what are you doing? Wait. No, don't leave me. I love you. You shouldn't say that to me. Come to mama, honey. I am going to him. You don't even have lipstick on. If you marry, shouldn't you do it right? Some people believe in fairytales? Hey. You are so pretty. Thanks. One for you, one for me and one for Hubert. Here we go. How do I know if he says yes? Imagine saying "no". Mom, please. I'll say it. Jeanne M. Tantois, Do you take Jumbo, present here, as your husband? Will you love him and be faithful to him for better or for worse, for health and ... Margarette ... - Is everything alright? - Continue. With health and disease. Continue. Will you love him and be faithful to him for better or for worse ... - Wait. - ... for health ... - We're not there yet. - No really. Hey, Jeannette! You are being filmed! Mom. I'll take care of that. - That's enough. - Who is that? Mom. - Stand up now. - But mama ... Jeanne! Do you want him for better or for worse until death do you part? Yes. - Do you realize he can't die? - Yes. Jumbo ... take you as a husband, wife, sorry, Jeanne Tantois, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health until death do you part? Stop! Stop it, I'm warning you! Do you want that? Margarette! - Damn it, Jeanne did he say yes! - No, wait! Say yes. Come on, Jumbo. He said yes. He said yes. Thanks, Virgin Mary. Hubert! - That hurts. - The bastard. We take him! I love you. Mommy, run! Mommy, run! Run! Run! For my father. Subtitles google translated by gentle_rage
