So you are questioning me a lot! l am not a confusing person as you think! lt's he! Don't leave him! That Sathya is a single person! Can't you murder him? Where is Seenathana? He has got caught! What? Has he got caught? Yes! People caught him! They might have handed over him in police by this time! We'd bring him out before they record his case in police station! That is impossible! Why? Because Seenathana got caught only after killing the police! So they will take him to the court definitely! He should not blabber anything! Sathya! Sit down! Nothing has happened to you, has it? Sit down, Sathya! l got worry hearing this news! Sorry! You're taking food! No! lt's ok! Tell me! No! l've come to see you! That's all! Any food...? lt's ok! You take Sathya!

Because you are good! You too are good, aren't you? Why do you scold him like this? What a logic is that? There is no logic in love! lt's like the film! lf Sathya comes & asks about me, tell that l am not here! Good morning, sister! Come Sathya! Want to take sweet? There is no shop today! Where's Geetha? lsn't there Geetha in home? Do you want to drink cool drinks? l asked about Geetha only! Don't make me to lie! Tell the truth, then! Sister! lf she is angry on me, she can spit on me in contact! She can fight with me! l don't know why she is hiding! l don't know how l'd act now! Can l get inside breaking the door? Or can l run off with tears...? l am telling you this, what l want to tell her! Tell to that fool! l love her very much! What do you want? What do you want? Why do you threaten me like this? You should believe me! How can l believe you? You are telling that you are working! What is your profession? Where is your office? l see you into the police station! Or l see your murder attempt! Who are you? How can l believe you having these doubts? But a thing, Geetha! l don't do any crime against law according to my conscience. This Dhandapany... l'd be grateful to Dhandapany! See! Jeep! Money! He is making me to get stunned by helping me! lf he had not given me money, my sister's life would have spoiled! Should not l thank him? Give me some days! l'll leave this job! But you'd trust me! You should not doubt me! Will you believe at least this? Lie will reflect in our eyes! Look my eyes! lf you believe this, you can believe my words too! Where is sir? Ok!

People killed him yesterday! Killed him...? Yes! lf it is some other politician, he will leave him! Sir is too sad thinking that! l am like you! l can't bear this, Sathya! Why should you bear this? You've received a matter for that! As duplicate medicines & children's death... Whose is the pharmacy? lt's Mariappa's pharmacy! There's a file for that! lf we get that, Mariappa will get punishment! You keep quiet! Sathya may go to bring that file for me! No need! Correct! Tell me where it is! l'll bring it! Don't bring! Sorry! You just keep quiet! l know the place of the file! Come! Let's go! Sathya! Won't you listen t o me? Sathya! He will tell like that by his affection on us! We should do something for his help! l know the place of that file! But l don't have guts! You have that! Come!

Seenathana should understand it! lf he tells the truth by his anger on me... lf l do something in the court, my name will get spoiled! What do you tell? Are we rowdies? l too don't understand that only! You didn't think! lf you had thought you'd have got the seat! lf we have a person like Sathya... l don't need him, sir! You won't get Sathya ever! l've sent him out! What's there for that? ls there only one Sathya in the city? There are many Sathyas throughout the country! One minute! l too will take the fire!

Money is great, man! What's the hatred between me & Seenathana? l don't know him! l did it thinking as a profession! l got money! Do you think 100 or 200? 50000 Rs! 50000 Rs...? You too want it, don't you? Go mad! Who told you to do? l don't know! You won't tell even if you know! Who gave you money? How much did he give? 500 Rs as advance! He gave me 500 Rs! He told that he'd give the balance later! l don't have a faith that l will go out from here! You only should give that money in my home, man! lf you accept the guilt, your punishment will reduce! Don't do anything like a mad! You too don't tell to anybody! lf anybody knows this, they will destroy my family! My work will become waste, then! Sir! lt's the time to leave! Money man! Money!

That is why our party's higher officials handed over me this! l get some questions while accepting such a great post! l doubt on me whether l can serve to people like him or not! You can do it definitely! You can do better than him! You too can kill poor people & children doing crimes! Because you both are from the same drainage! Mariappa is better than you! He's a thief!
