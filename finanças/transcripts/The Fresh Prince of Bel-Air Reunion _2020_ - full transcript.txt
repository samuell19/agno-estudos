[playing Beethoven's - Three words to describe "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air?" Um... Revolutionary. d - Power to the people! - Hilarious. - And poignant. - Here's to my wonderful family. - Yeah. - There will be no next season for "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air." - The final episode of "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" airs tonight on NBC. - What a great run for that show. - Mm-hmm, six years. - Sure was. - You know, Will, this is the last time we'll ever live together. [gentle piano version of - Five seconds, four, three, two. - The house feels so empty. - Yeah. It's kinda creepy. - Well, it's a part of us. These walls have heard our laughter and our tears. Leaving is like leaving a grand, old friend. d [upbeat instrumental d f [gentle, uplifting - Hey. - Oh, Daphne, come here. - Well, well, well. - Snazz! - Oh, man. It's, like, classic. It's perfect. - Master William! - The last time we were here, we cleared this place out. - I know. - And we cried. - How crazy is it walking in here? - The good, old days. The good, old days. - The good, old days, look at this. - We're missing our TV. - That was with the, "Hilary, will you..." - Marry me? d ["The Fresh Prince So welcome, everybody, back to the... The set where a big chunk of our lives were lived out, and when I first walked on this set, I went, "Ah." You know, you just don't... You don't realize how much life gets spent at work. - Yeah. - And it's just a beautiful thing for us that this turned into a real family and not work. - Right. - You know? - We were all from different parts of the world, and the camaraderie was just immediate. I immediately felt comfortable and at home. - It was such a fast family. You know, you have fast friendships? We had a really fast family. - We have some problems, but what family doesn't? All I know is, when I need these people, they are right there for me. - Of all the new TV shows slated for this fall, the one drawing the most favorable attention is called "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air." - I have a TV show coming out. - Uh-huh. - And it's... you know, my... Like, the Fresh Prince, that's... you know, that's my nickname, the Fresh Prince. - The Fresh Prince? Oh, I read about you somewhere. - Really? - Yeah. - What do you guys remember about the pilot? What are your memories? - I remember... - Hey, don't be looking like you about to tell my business. - I'm about to. I remember the pilot. I was beyond nervous. I was so scared. I was praying for an earthquake. - Earthquake! - Wow. - Earthquake? - I was so scared. I came out. - Were we gonna be safe in the, like... - It didn't matter. It didn't matter. - I came out, I'm saying my stuff. I'm trying to get through and do... just do my thing and keep it together, and you mouthed lines... - Ah, damn! - Back to me for the first time. All rehearsal you never did it. - I don't... okay. - All rehearsal, you never did it. The night in front of the audience, you looked up at me and went... d - And I was just going d - You did it to me too. - I did it to you. - And I was a nervous wreck, and I was like, "Oh, my God!" - All right, so wait. So my side of that was when we were on the set of the pilot, that was my first time, like, really doing dialogue. - So you did everybody's dialogue? - I learned everybody's. So it's on the episode. You can see it on the episodes. - Oh, yeah, you can see it. - I saw one episode, though, where you're standing, like, behind the couch in the living room scene. - Yeah? - And it's you and whoever else. - Was that Don Cheadle? - Tray! - Prince! Homey, homey! - They literally had to show me, and I was like. - That's the one that was like, "Okay, we need to change this." - You don't go to school, Ice Tray? - Oh, sure I do. I've been held back in the tenth grade three times in a row. - Three times? - Yeah, see, my motto is when I find a grade I like, I stick with it. I stick with it. - That's terrible. That's terrible. Oh, wow. Oh, that's painful to watch. - She was so ugly that Freddy Krueger used to have nightmares about her. - Was it the fifth episode when you finally had enough and you were like... 'cause I remember in rehears... She just looked and she said, "Stop it!" I knew everybody's lines. I would have played Uncle Phil. I could have played Aunt Viv. I was... I knew everybody's words. Does anybody remember their audition? - I mean, I remember very little of it, obviously, but, like, I do remember... - Oh, no. - Oh! Ohhh! - Alfonso Ribeiro. - You're ten, you're ten. - Whoo! - Okay. What am I wearing? What have you been doing in here? - Just maxing and relaxing. - I meant what have you been doing to this room? - Oh, I'm trying to make it a little more. Malcolm X, he's my hero. - Well, he was a great man. I don't know if I'd call him my hero exactly. - Whoa. Wow. d - All right, first, I would say... - No, no, we're gonna give that a moment of silence! - Okay, yes. I know I didn't go there wearing a sweat suit believing that I was gonna get that character. I don't know what I was thinking. I don't know how I got that job. - You know what thought... - That dude sucked! - No, no. - No. - You are so much fun to watch. - Yeah, I wanna watch you. - With everything you do. - Thank goodness. I guess somewhere along the line people were able to see the magic that I clearly couldn't see. - Do you remember your audition? - They had me audition in New York, and I remember my mom and my aunties being really excited because I was auditioning for Quincy Jones. That was my second call. - Mm-hmm. - Oh. - And they had me rap, but they had the kids, like, last-minute, make up a rap. - A rap? - Like, I can sing. I can't rap. Like, that's a whole 'nother skill set. d And I guess I was probably so corny and so bad that that's probably why... - That's perfect! - I remember thinking, like, "This is really horrible." - Do you remember your audition? No, I'm just... I'm just asking. Do you... - Ahh! - Karyn Parsons. Lord, have mercy on me, oh, my goodness. Dad, I need $300. - Hilary, your cousin Will's here. - Hi. Dad, I need $300. Like, I'm going on the Save the Ozone celebrity bus next Saturday, and it's gonna be Bruce Willis and Demi and Rob Lowe and Emilio Estevez or Charlie Sheen, I don't remember which. - Wow. That's beautiful. d - I auditioned a lot. - Did you really? - I auditioned a lot, and I remember the network one because it was down to... There were, like, you know, two Hilarys, and I was so nervous, and I caught my reflection in something, and I remember I kinda started primping and... And it was like, I started feeling her. She started, like, coming over... - They're like, "You got it. You got the role!" - No, but you could absolutely see... See the Hilary. - That was Hilary. - Come to life. Even as little as the way you held your bottom jaw. - Yeah, yeah, it's like... - Right? Like, it was so just, like, ha. - I'm in a bad mood, and somebody is going to suffer. - I didn't go to the audition in 1990 because they said, "Oh, we want you to audition for this new sitcom with a rapper." I said, "Mm, pass." I said, "Um, um, thank you, no, no." And I left, and I watched the show come on in September. I said, "Oh, damn, that's cute." - Got this whole town of Bel-Air buzzing. - Get a load of me and my rapping cousin! - Yeah, you know. So Quincy Jones basically steamrolled me through the whole process without ever really auditioning me, right? So the only kind of audition I had was the... Quincy's birthday. The show was an idea. Benny Medina had pitched me the idea, and it's like, I was making music, and they were like, "Come to Quincy's house. We have this idea for a TV show." I'm like, "Okay," you know? - "I'll go to Quincy's." So I got to Quincy's house, and Benny Medina pitched me the whole idea of the show, and he's like, you know, "We have this... this idea," 'cause it was based on Benny Medina's life. - His life, right. - He went from Watts to Beverly Hills. So I'm like, "Cool," so we go to Quincy's house, and Benny's like, "Hey, you know, this is... This is the Fresh Prince." Quincy said, "I know who that boy is. I seen his stuff," you know? "Hey, come on in. Come on in." So Quincy, it's his birthday. He had been tasting a little bit, right? So he was... he was wetting his beak. He wet his beak, right? So he... you know, he's like, "Come on in." So we go in, and he said... he said, "Where you from?" I said, "I'm from Philly." He said, "Your character's from Philly." "Oh." Like, "Okay. Give me a glass of whatever Quincy's drinking." Right? So it's like... It's Quincy's birthday, so it's like... It's a big party, so everybody's in there, you know? So it was Brandon Tartikoff, who's the head of NBC, Warren Littlefield, all of that. So everybody gets in the room, and Quincy, he says, "Hey! Clear the living room out! Clear the living room out! We gonna do an audition." - Oh, man. - You like go, "Who?" - Right, I'm saying, "Who? Who..." Yeah, "Who's gonna audition?" And he was like, "Yeah, you got it. You got it. You got it." I said, "Q, Q, no, no," and he grabs me, and he takes me in the other room, and he sits me down in his office, and there's a 48 million "Thriller" thing. There's a "Color Purple," and he sits me under this 70 Grammys, you know, this Em... and I'm sitting under all of that stuff, like... And Michael's looking down on me like... So Quincy says, "Okay, what do you need?" and I said, "Quincy, I'm the... I don't know how to... I'm not an actor. "I just... just give me two weeks, "Let me find an acting coach, and let me work on it, and then let's just set up a proper audition." He said, "Oh, so two weeks. You only need two weeks?" I said, "Yeah, yeah, just two weeks." He said, "So here's the deal. "Right now everybody "that needs to say yes for this show is sitting out in that living room right now waiting for you." - It's now. - And I was like... I was like, "Give me ten minutes." And he's like, "All right! Audition in ten minutes! Audition in ten minutes!" - Far out. - They did a deal memo that night. That's how we got to the pilot that fast. - Whoa. - How is it possible I've known you this long and never heard that story? - I know. - I know, right? - Do you remember, we were on tour? - We were in Detroit, yep. - We were on tour and had a day off. - Yep. - And Will flew and came... - To go to "The Arsenio Hall Show." - And said, "I got a TV show." Being from Philly, "I got a TV show" was a homeboy with a camcorder. No one thought anything other than that. - It was probably six weeks later, we were on the set, right? - Wow. - Okay, Will, just come downstage a little. Okay, actually, no, you're fine, and go. - I remember our first table reading. Will and Alfonso were chasing each other around the table. There were network executives and all kinds of thi... You know, really powerful people, and they were just playmates from the very beginning. - Look who's here, Will. - Hey! Who is he? - One of the things I've always been able to recognize in my life is chemistry. - Mm-hmm. - And that really came alive on the show, the comedic relationship that we were able to develop. The initial focus of the show was going to be Will, Uncle Phil collisions. - Oh, my God. - We started to see the dynamics between the other characters, and Uncle Phil, Aunt Viv were holding the base, and Will and Carlton being able to run wild. - Yo, how you playing me, Prince? - What? - Yo, you dissin' me! - C'mon, man, stop it! It became clear very quickly that that was the most powerful comedic asset of the show. [The Sugarhill Gang's - We understood that someone had to be the straight man. - Yep, absolutely. - For the other person's silliness and comedy. - Absolutely. d - It was never as crystal clear as "this is a Carlton moment," or "this is a Will moment." - Mm-hmm. - It was always the show that came first. - I saved your life! You owe me! - We knew that we could rely on each other, and there was always a respect and a trust. Is that the police? - Punch it, man. We in a Benz. - Are you crazy? I'd call this a lucky break. A policeman is our pal. We can ask him for directions. The episode where Will and Carlton get pulled over made it abundantly clear that Will came from the streets, Carlton grew up in Bel-Air. - Listen to me, Carlton. When he comes up, keep your hands on the wheel. - Good evening, officer. Carlton Banks. - Keep your hands on the wheel. - Culturally, we learned how to see other people's points of view. - Even when you make fun of me, I know you're doing it out of love. Influences change people. Will learned from Carlton. Carlton learned from Will. You can't be the same kid before Will comes into that house and be the same kid six years later. Admit it, Will. You care about me. - I do not. - You love me. Hey, my brother, you wanna take this outside? How about you do the Carlton dance real quick? Do the Carlton dance. - How about I don't and say I did? - I never, ever could do the Carlton dance. For whatever reason, I can't find the... There's an opposite thing that he does, and I can't... I just never... I never was able to get it. - The first time, all it said in the script was, "Carlton dances," and I needed to figure out how this character would dance. What would be the actual move that hit it perfect? - You got to do it. One last time for me, man. [Tom Jones' - That final moment doing it together, that was, like, Will finally making the full acceptance of Carlton, and we are in sync and as one. d - We did six seasons and, you know, 150 episodes, so it's like, finding my favorite moment is really hard. This is a job for Sherlock Homeboy. - My favorite episode is "Def Poet's Society." - Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Rafael de la Ghetto! d - The Rafael de la Ghetto was fun for Joe to break character. - Cannons to the right of them! - Cannons to the left of them. Cannons in front of them. Volleyed and thundered! Talk about ham acting, that's brilliant. - One of my most memorable moments was in the first season when you guys blackmailed Hilary. d I was really worried about how people were gonna feel about Hilary all the time, and I'm like, "They're just gonna hate her. They're gonna hate her. They're gonna hate her," which was true, and I found out just how much in that episode. - That's awful. Is he making you clean his room? - No. - Will you clean mine? - Do you remember the audience? - I do remember. - The audience, yeah. - They started stomping out there. d - Hilary! - Woof! - A lot of sitcoms just had the... You know, they had the laugh knob that they would turn up, and there were moments on the show where we had to dial the laughter back. - Hilary Banks! - Oh, yes, Trevor? - Will you marry me? d d - The Trevor moment was another one of those... - Oh. - Yes. - One of those sustained laughs. - I ain't no bungee expert or nothing, but I don't think he's supposed to be slamming into the ground like that. - I had my first kiss on the show. Like, my first actual kiss. - I think I'd feel better if I-I could kiss you. d - I was so nervous, and we're about to do the scene. Is it terrible that I want to kiss you back? And I swear to you, I see Alfonso, Will and Karyn peek out from behind a camera like, "Oh." - Can I blow in your ear? d - That was all so... Like, I was 11, having, like, breakdown... Like, "I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know how to do this," because everything... - Think of you doing that as an 11-year-old... - You gotta act like you got this tic, right? Like the Army did this experiment on you, right, that just went terribly wrong. You be like, "Back up! Back up! "Mind your business, that's all. Mind your business." Back up! Back up! Mind your business, that's all. Just mind your business. - That's good. - Me getting tossed out was written into the very first show that I did. When it aired, everybody loved it. - When do we eat here? - We eat here later. You eat here never. - Looks like you eat here often. Ahh! One day we filmed maybe about 150 takes of me getting tossed out of the house. Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! I think they didn't want to torture me anymore, so that's the reason why they started using the same shot, and then that became a thing, that every time I walked into a scene and I had that shirt on, the audience kind of knew what was coming up. - You know the drill. - Uh-oh. Ahh! Ahh! - My favorite moment, I think... I think... and there's so many things, but one that comes to mind right away of my favorite is when you lost your mind and dragged yourself across that floor. - Oh, my goodness. - That's my favorite. - Yes. - That's my favorite scene. - And into the... That was, I think... I've never laughed that hard in my life. - Oh, my gosh, he's still up there! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - I don't know what you were doing. - What got into you? - Like, what... what... - No, no, no, so... - But, like, what... How do you know how to do that? - There's a lot of things that I do that I don't know how I do, but... How could you do it? Oh, God! No, no, no! The scene was set up perfectly for it, and I was like, "Let's just break the fourth wall and go absolutely crazy." How could you do it? Never before had those moments... - Be allowed to be... - Be allowed to be on TV. d - That was a serious no-no. You don't break the fourth wall in sitcom television. - How could he do that? Oh, my God! - I'm telling you, that breaking of the fourth wall with the audience, that's a... That's a really special part of that connection that we had with the audience. - Yeah. - Look at me when I'm talking to you. d - Run! - There's something different about you. - We so rich. Why we can't afford no ceiling? - That was cute. - Like, that... That relationship with the audience, it was like they were in on the joke with us. - And I always felt like the audience appreciated... - Being brought in. - Being let in. - Yeah. - Right? Like, you're watching this, and it's written, wink, wink. - And while we're on the subject... - That's kinda fly, right? Don't you wish you lived on TV? - When we were doing the show, I have to say I always felt like it was just us and the audience that was present. I had no sense of millions of viewers beyond that. - Oh. - Let alone decades and generations after that. - Yeah. - I just want to sit here and watch a little TV. - It was three shows. It was "Monday Night Football." It was "Monday Night Movie." And "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air." - People would leave "Monday Night Football," go over to that other channel, and watch "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air." - It's like a beautiful underdog position where you're not really expected to win. You're not gonna beat "Monday Night Football," but we enjoyed the rumble. d Now it's on! - People loved watching the show, which meant a lot because they didn't have it on their phones. You had to actually watch it to see it, and then the next day you would have to read about it in the newspaper. - I realized that this show was bigger than I could have ever expected when there were 80-year-old grandmothers that would come up to me and say, "Jazz." That freaked me out because I didn't correlate that people were recognizing you from the television show. - One thing special to me about the show was we had a really unique and distinct fashion sense. - I didn't realize how much freedom we had when it came down to the clothes. - We always wanted to have the hottest stuff on. You know, we were always trying to find what was the hottest new thing. - It isn't as easy at it looks. - This was a very impactful time in pop culture, where, you know, you wanted to be fly. - Eh, it's a little something I put together. Jordan would send over the new Jordans six weeks before they were coming out. - You don't realize, you're wearing a pair of Jordans that this picture is circulated among sneakerheads for the past 30 years. - Ah. That's what's wrong. - What? - Ha ha. - You know, I think that "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" is a bigger hit now than it was ever before. - Yes, it's the cast, and the cast is fun to watch and all of that, but I think it's the idea of it as the part that, I think, translates to so many different places. - For years, I've had people come up to me and say, "This show was my favorite show, and now it's my son's favorite show." And I think "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" had a lot of impact. - The things that stuck out for me whenever I've thought of this show has always been our Tuesdays and Wednesdays run-throughs. - The way the week would work, we'd come in on Monday. Everybody's there, writers, producers, director, everybody, and we read the screenplay. - Why don't you, Mom? It's all hollow and meaningless anyway, so... Did I say it right? I'm... - We'd come in on Tuesday, and we'd kinda block it, and we'd work it, but it was our time to present our ideas and our thoughts and, "Hey, what if it was like this? What about that?" - And I just kinda stop and just watch? - Yeah, 'cause you supposed to hear the kids and turn back around. - Okay. - That Tuesday and Wednesday would be a beautifully collaborative period where the actors would find the soul and the truth of the moments for these characters. - The idea that we, as a Black show on TV, one of three at the time, right? There weren't really us in the writers room, and as an actor, you never had a voice. You never had a voice in the room. You were a puppet who was told what to do. - Take your notes. - Say this line. - Yeah. - Move over here. - At some point the producers and the writers wanted to make Hilary a strong Black woman. They wanted to, like, see that switch in her, and then I felt like, you know, there are some people who are just flawed and see things a certain way, and you can learn a lot from them too. Look, I'm a career woman. I don't have time to dust and push around that... Oh, what do you call that big, loud thing that sucks up everything? - We were able to share the experience, the real experience and gave those writers our perspective. - Yeah. - You can put your hands down, Jazz. - No way. Dude's got a gun. Next thing you know, I got six warning shots in my back. When we did the courtroom scene, there was a level of truth to it. That's the reason why they wrote it. I'm putting my hands down now. - Part of the power of what we would always do with "The Fresh Prince," there would be very powerful ideas under the jokes and under the comedy. - You can wear the T-shirts, you can put up the posters, and you can shout the slogans, but unless you know all the history behind it, you're trivializing the entire struggle. - That is one of those things that I think kinda makes people understand just how groundbreaking this show was. - It is as relevant today as it was 30 years ago, unfortunately. - Whenever we would come across moments that they wrote that was like, "This wouldn't happen..." - Right. - "Black people don't do this." - Right. - Yes. - Tuesday and Wednesday is what made this show special, because we made sure that we were authentic every episode. - I had spent a career being on shows that showed the variety of the Black culture, showing that we were not just a monolithic group of people with one idea and one lifestyle, and when I got here, we had the freedom to express to the writers the cultural aspects of what they had in the written word. I remember a table read one Monday, and there was some line that they had given Tatyana to say, and I said, "Excuse me, if Tatyana says that to her daddy, she'd lose her teeth." - Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly. - So no, culturally, we don't do that. - James used to sit where you're sitting... - Yep. - That was James's spot. - During those note sessions, and that is where I learned that what we do is not for us. It's not about us. We are here to bring dignity... - Mm-hmm. - To represent, to expand, to push forward, and I learned that here at his feet. - This one takes the cake. - James is the heart of the show. - I love you, Uncle Phil. - We knew that he knew the answers or could guide folks to the answers. - Carlton, sit. - As you wish, Father. - James had a very deep love of jazz music, and I would spend a lot of times in his dressing room, and he would give me jazz CDs. - You know, he got his Billie Holiday picture up on the wall, a little Charlie "Bird" Parker, you know? Boy, I'm telling you, this man got mad flavor. - The music that was coming out of his room was always just amazing. - Ashley, honey, this is possibly the most beautiful music ever written. - He was my teacher. I learned what it means to be an artist from him. - Learning that there's other works, there's other arts out there that would help you understand yours even better. - I was watching this Robeson documentary, and James used to bring up Paul Robeson. He, like, introduced me to Black art in ways that I wouldn't have gotten that education anywhere else, and I'm watching this documentary, and they're talking about him singing "Ol' Man River." Him changing the word from "nigger" to "darkie." - Darkie, yeah. - How hard he had to fight for that one word. - Yeah. - It wasn't that long ago. - And it wasn't that long ago. So you think about that, you think about all the shows that came before... and I'm just talking about television. - Every little step. - And now what we see, it's such a privilege to be a part of that. - Yes. - Yeah. - You know, that history, and those notes sessions, that's where I went to school, like, that's... - And that was... No, that was the thing. James, he pushed me so hard. - You think you're so wise. Look at me when I'm talking to you. Let me tell you something, son. I grew up on the streets just like you. I encountered bigotry you could not imagine. Now, you have a nice poster of Malcolm X on your wall. I heard the brother speak. I read every word he wrote. Believe me, I know where I come from. - His thing was that I am in such a unique position, and that responsibility, you must elevate your craft. You have to represent, and you are paving a way, and he just wouldn't give me an inch, and I remember in the... One of my favorite and most famous scenes from "Fresh Prince" is the father episode. Hey, what's up, man? Can I get you something? - No, I'm fine, son. - Um, if you need... - So is he a cop? - He's my father. So, you know, James Avery was this 6'4", 300-pound... - Plus. - Yeah. - Stage-trained... - Yeah. - Shakespearean beast, right? And I'm... I'm the little rapper from Philly under him, right? And I wanted him to think I was good so bad. - You wanted him to be proud of you. - I wanted him to be proud of me, so the episode comes, and, you know, we come to that scene, and I was like, I'm... you know, I wanna deliver this scene so bad, and if you remember, in front of the audience, I flubbed my line on the take. - Mm-hmm. - And I messed it up in front of the audience, and my mind snapped, and I'm like, "Aghh!" I'm like, "Ahh! Damn it!" And James says, "Hey! Right here!" and I was like... and he was like, "Use me!" And I'm like... And I'm right there, and he takes, and he's like, "Get yourself together," And I get it together, and I'm looking, and he says, "Action." - I'm sorry, I... You know, if there was something that I could do... - Hey, you know what? You ain't got to do nothing, Uncle Phil. You know, ain't like I'm still five years old, you know? Ain't like I'ma be sitting up every night asking my mom, "When is Daddy coming home?" You know? Who needs him? And the scene that we do is the scene that ended up being in the episode. I ain't need him then, and I don't need him now. - Will, Will... - Nah, you know what, Uncle Phil? I'ma get through college without him. I'm get a great job without him. I'ma marry me a beautiful honey, and I'ma have me a whole bunch of kids. I'ma be a better father than he ever was! And I sure as hell don't need him for that 'cause ain't a damn thing he could ever teach me about how to love my kids! d How come he don't want me, man? And I fall into his arms at the end of the scene, and he's holding me, and, you know, the shot pans off, and he whispered in my ear, he said, "Now, that's acting," right? - That's right. - "That's acting," and I was like, "Ahh!" You know, every single time. - I cry every time I see that. - Every single time, you know? And it's like, he just... He, um... he, uh... It's like... oh, come on. Don't do this. - I know, I'm s... I'm sorry. - Tatyana throwing me off. And it's like, when... It's like, people do... People don't even know when they're shaping you and forming you and crafting you. - He knew. - In that w... he knew. No, that's what I'm saying. - I think he knew. - He knew what he was doing. - There's some people that plant seeds. - Yep. - That's what they do. And they do it to anyone they come across. - I mean, he was... He was proud of who he was. He was proud of his race. He was proud of the history of his race. - Yes. - And, you know, he could see it, you know? And it fell upon you, you know? It fell upon you to grab the rein. - Vote for Philip Banks. Philip Banks. Break out Lucille. I've got a few questions for you. When you got this alleged confession from these two young men, did they have a lawyer present? No, so, officer, just open that damn cell and let those two boys out of there, or I'm gonna tie this place up in so much litigation that your grandchildren are gonna need lawyers! d - That's right. - Nicky, you remember in "The Lion King" when Mufasa... - Daddy, did you sit on Harry? - Yes, but... but... - That's okay, Dad. Death is a natural part of life. - All right, all right. - Oh, no. - Now, noble Geoffrey, the gods today stand beside us. - A lot of good times in this house, huh? - A lifetime's worth. Trust me, Will. I know it doesn't feel like it right now, but what they say is true. Winning really isn't everything. I'm sorry I let you down, son. - You could never let me down, Dad. - I love you. Just remember, happiness comes from inside. - I love you, Daddy. - Nobody does anything without help, Will. People opened doors for me, and I've worked hard to open doors for you. It doesn't make you any less of a man to walk through them. I have something special. - You always said that spending time with me and the family was the most important thing to you. - I'm lucky to have such a wonderful family. - Look, Uncle Phil, I just don't want you to think that I'm that same stupid kid I was when I first moved out here. I love you, Uncle Phil, and I just don't want to lose you, you know, any of you. - You're not gonna lose us. You are my son, Will. End of story. - Amen. Well, guys, give him a hand. - Yeah. - Give him a hand. - Yes. - Oh, James, I miss you. - James, man. - Whew. I think what happens on family shows like this, it's one of those things, you cannot buy or fake chemistry. It's just the way that we all came together as a group was very special. So as a family, you know, we have our things that we talk about and then we have our things that we don't talk about. - Where are you going with this? - Yeah, I know. - You know? We never really together, like, publicly talk about... um, Janet. - Hmm. - And what happened, and for me, it felt like I couldn't celebrate 30 years of "Fresh Prince" without finding a way to celebrate Janet. So she agreed to sit down and have a conversation with me, and Janet and I saw one another for the first time in 27 years yesterday. - Wow. - And I wanna show you guys some of... - Oh, my gosh. - Ooh, wow. - Take a seat here. - Okay. - Thank you very much. If you need anything at all, let me know. - Okay. - Okay, thank you. - Tell me if my eyes glow like a raccoon 'cause they sometimes do. - Your eyes look spectacular. It's so good to see you. - You too, you too. Oh, my God. Where are you sitting? Been a long time. - It's been a real long time, 20... - 30. - My name is Janet Hubert, and I played the role of Vivian Banks. I guess they call me the O.G., the original Aunt Vivian. - The night is young, baby, and so am I. My life is great. This party is gonna be great, and I look fantastic. - Janet brought such authenticity and dignity. - My name is not Mom. My name is Professor Banks. That is how I prefer to be addressed. Is that clear, class? Yes, Professor Banks. - I didn't expect to get the role because I had not seen anyone who looked like me playing those kinds of roles. - We just want to make sure that the person we get is properly qualified. - For example, a college professor with a PhD who's taught Black history and literature at the university level? - Where are we gonna find someone like that? - You're looking at her. - Janet was this beautiful, dark-skinned, talented... she could sing. She could dance. - One, two, three. Ooh. - I enjoyed it. I loved it. I loved the way they wrote. I loved that she was professional. I loved that she was intelligent, she was refined, but I also loved that she could throw down. This has got to be the biggest amateur operation I have seen since "Mayberry R.F.D." It was a rare thing to be able to say, wearing a $5,000 sweater, "What? What? Philip?" Oh, honey, we 'bout to get very busy up in here. "Hold me back. Hold me back." - There was a certain foundational element that was broken when Janet left. - Well... This has been tough. - Yeah. - Has it been tough for you? - Oh, yes, it has. - Yeah. I just wanted to know one thing. - Mm-hmm? - Why? Why so far? You guys went so far. I lost so much. - I think what would be... - How do we heal that? - Helpful for me is, like, I know... - You look good, by the way. - Oh, thank you. Thank you. You look beautiful, as always. - Older, wiser. - So I think it would be helpful for me... Like, I don't know your story. - Mm-hmm, I know. I know. - You know? - I know. - I don't know... - You have no idea. - You know, I don't know your story. - It was insane. Something I would like to clarify is during that third season when I got pregnant, there was a lot of things going on in my life and in Will's life as well. There was some friction because I was pregnant. Home life was not good at all. I was no longer laughing, smiling, joking because there were things that were going on that nobody knew about. The cast had no idea what was going on. - You know, during that time of her pregnancy, I wasn't sensitive. I wasn't perceptive, and, you know, now that I've had three kids, I learned some things that I did not know at the time, and I would do things very differently, but I can see where I made the set very difficult for Janet. - They offered me this really bad deal in the third season. They said, "You've got two months "and two weeks of work, and you cannot work anywhere else." So that meant my salary was cut. I had a new baby and a husband who was out of work, so I said no. I did not accept their offer. I was never fired. So the misconception was always put out there. I was trapped. What could I do? So they said, "Okay, then we're gonna recast your role," and I said, "What can I say?" I was hurt deeply, deeply. - So talk me through because I was having a different experience. - You were going forward and getting bigger, but we knew you were going to be huge. I mean, we all knew that. I even said that, that part of the success of the show was because of your success, but you were destined for that as well, but when I left the show, I had this new baby and no one. Family disowned me. Hollywood disowned me. My family said, "You've ruined our name," and I wasn't unprofessional on the set. I just stopped talking to everybody because I didn't know who to trust because I had been banished, and they said it was you who... who banished me because you were... You were Will. You were a kid. It was hard. - Yeah. I was, uh, 21 years old. - Yeah. - You know? - I know. I know. - Everything was a threat to me. - Why was I a threat? - Not you, the world. I was so driven by fear, and jokes and comedy and all of that was how... - Yeah, yeah, you were... You were live. - Yeah. - You were live. - But what you didn't realize either, that I was going through a lot at home. - Mm-hmm, right. - You didn't know. - Yup, yup. - You guys didn't know, very abusive marriage. - You know, I have children. - Yeah. - I've been divorced and have a second marriage. And I can see now the level of pain and the level of struggle that it was for you just to show up every day, and then... - But you took all that away from me with your words. You know, words can kill. - Mm-hmm. - I lost everything, reputation, everything, everything, and I understand you were able to move forward, but you know those words, calling a Black woman difficult in Hollywood is the kiss of death. It's the kiss of death, and it's hard enough being a dark-skinned Black woman in this business, but I felt it was necessary for us to finally move forward. - Yep. - And I'm sorry that I have blasted you to pieces. - Nah, it's... it is so... First of all, thank you for sharing that with me. Like, I didn't know that. When I've looked back now, it's... You know, it's obvious that you were having a hard time, and... I felt like you hated me. - No. - You know, I... I could not do a 30-year celebration of this show and not celebrate you, celebrate your contribution to the show, celebrate your contribution to my life, you know? And... - Come here, you. 27 years, I think... I think we were just short of 27 years that we didn't speak to one another, and I'm just... I'm glad we're talking again. The person I want to be is someone who protects you, not someone that unleashes dogs on you, and however... - I appreciate that. - You know, it's... - I appreciate that. I have to say, after 27 years, being here today and having the conversation that Will and I had together, it's healing. I was watching the dance episode the other day, and that's become one of the crazy, iconic... - Yeah. - They send me videos from all over the world. - On the TikTok right now. - Of their mamas doing it. - I know, right? - Oh, God. Their mamas... - Listen, the Aunt Viv, boy, rocking the Aunt Viv. - The Aunt Viv. I don't know if it's real. I feel like this is a dream. I didn't come here to have animosity. I came here to resolve, 'cause it's time. You still feel like... - Like I'm little? - Yeah. Yes. - You're still my Aunt Viv. You're still my Aunt Viv. - Yeah, you do. It's so weird. You know, we've said such hateful things about each other publicly. - Oh, I know. Ugh. - And I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - And I'm sorry too. We good? - We good. - We good. - We are good. One of the major things for me, it was the first time I was ever able to see how much pain she is in and was in and just... - Jesus. - What she was carrying, you know, what she was trying to hide, what she was trying to hold onto, and, you know, she set a tone, and she set a... Set a standard on this show that's an integral part of the success of "The Fresh Prince," you know? So she asked to... You know, were you guys open to speak to her, and, you know, is... - I've never met her. - You've never met her? - I have never met her. - Wow. Janet Hubert Whitten, ladies and gentlemen. - Hey. d What's up? - Seeing Daphne and Janet, my two moms, the two Aunt Vivs come together, and they've never met before. Seeing them meet for the first time and embrace was the most incredible thing. It was like... almost like something just released. It was so beautiful. - That was chilling. That was a full-circle moment. - It just... it made my heart really full. - I cannot tell you how unbelievable and wonderful it feels that I... I'm overwhelmed. - I don't wanna be that guy, you know? I go out in the world, and I, you know, talk about understanding and human relationships and then have somebody that I hadn't spoken to in 27 years. I just... I'm so happy that we were able to make that reconciliation, and I hope other people can take something from it. What was so great about this show was how we became a family. You kinda fall into your roles and... - Hey! - Oh, that's so awesome! - Good to see you. - Yes, hello. - Nicky, Nicky. - Oh, my gosh. - Hey, my man. How are you, buddy? - My baby grew up. - Great to see you. - Good to see you too. - What's up, man? - What's up? What's up? Man, it's so good to see everybody. This is so surreal. I mean, the recreation of the set is incredible. I mean, I feel like a kid again. - Oh, yeah? As I look back to this show it just captured a time in our lives that is really the golden era of my career. Come on, let's go on inside. Let's check to see what's going on on the set, you know, backstage and all that. - Ah, the Friday night ritual. What was it like? - We'd go to Will's room. He would be jamming in there. [The Sugarhill Gang's Ho! Ho! Ho! - You'd just start hearing music coming from Will's room, booming, and you'd just start following like the Pied Piper. - We would have music playing. We would dance, jam, have a great time, singing, rapping, whatever. - It was just kinda like, "Oh, my God, this is a Friday night party." - It was kind of like, I think, what you would do before a concert or something, you know? The whole band gets together and says a prayer. - I just have to say there's not another group of people that I would rather be in this kind of circle with 149-some-odd times. - Hey. - Yeah. - Yeah! - Yeah. - Yeah! - Man. - Ditto. - Oh, ditto. Even though James takes up most of the circle. - Ditto. As well I should. - Let's go out there, and let's just have some fun. Let's give 'em some! - We changed the way sitcoms were shot. - People would come to the taping like they were going to a club, and it was a full-on experience. Yo, yo, yo! - We'd have our moment together, and then we'd head out. - And we would get to our living room, and there was a little dairy basket of musical percussion instruments. - Oh, that's a good one. That's a good one, hold on. All right, I think I'ma do that. I'ma do that, all right. So this is how we would do. This is how... This is how we do. [announcer shouting, - We'd each grab one, and we would start. - Sometimes it was just sticks. It was all kinds of stuff to bang on the walls and create rhythms. - The energy that that created for a live performance is not to be believed. - All right, yeah, yeah, all right, we about to go on stage with it live. The audience is out there. - We would just get the energy up to here and then, like, surf. - Miss Tatyana M. Ali! - It felt like it was a show. It wasn't a TV show. It was a show. - Alfonso Ribeiro! There he is. Ms. Karyn Parsons! Hilary! Ms. Daphne Maxwell Reid! Vivian! James Avery, Uncle Phil! - I wanted to hit the stage like a fighter, you know, with your theme music coming and all that. - Mr. Will, Will Smith! d - Will kinda brought the energy that we had in doing music to the show, crowd participation, throw your hands in the air. - Let me hear you say, "Yeah!" Yeah! - Say, "Hell yeah!" Hell yeah! - Everybody scream. - Everyone felt like they wanted to be at a "Fresh Prince" taping on a Friday night. It was the hottest ticket in town, as they called it. - Now everybody scream! d Oh, yeah! There was nothing like that. - He walked right by. - Aw. - Get off me! Mwah! We knew at the end of season five that there would only be one more season. - Welcome to the... Welcome to the final reading. - The final. - Of "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air." All right, gang, here we go. Let's give it a read. We fade in for the last time. - It was hard to come to terms with, you know? It was six years of playing house with people I adored. - We really did become family, and it's something that is the essence of the show. - It's so strange because now, like James was saying and what Tatyana was saying, everybody, we're such a family now, and it's just so sad. This is so sad. This is so hard. You know, I was an only child, so here all of a sudden I have a... I have a brother and a sister, and I had Will, who was like a brother, and, you know, James Avery took being my father very seriously. He called me "daughter." - Alfonso was absolutely a big brother to me. Karyn is just a woman that I look up to and admire. - A lot of good times spent in this house. - A lifetime's worth. - I'm not gonna miss the house though. I'ma... I'ma miss all the people that lived in the house. You know, but I want you to call me on Sundays when you call the rest of the... Well, I want you to call me on Sundays when you call the rest of your children. I love you, Uncle Phil, and I don't wanna lose you, I mean, any of you. - They embrace. - Think about, like, people that you see every single day for six years of your life, in the... you see them more than you see your own family. - Okay, and we're out. - This has been very unique for all of us, and I can honestly say, 'cause I've been working about 15 years or so, I don't know, but this has been the best experience in terms of a TV show, in terms of people and friends and happiness, and I've got to stop now. Okay. - Thank you. - All right. - You know, it was a very difficult week for all of us, knowing that we were never gonna be together again like that ever again. - You know, we've been... We've been blessed in a way that a lot of people don't get to experience and to be able to do what we love, but to also put things out in the world that display our love. And I've done a lot of things in my life, and I just want to thank all of you for making this the most beautiful job and life experience that I've ever had. Y'all know that this the final episode of "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," right? You know, it's sad, but we had a six-year run, so we would like for y'all to sit back and enjoy the second half of what you just watched. Ladies and gentlemen, "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," for the last time, coming at you. Peace! d The final week was interesting for me. It was all... it was all... It's still... It was fuzzy in my mind. I think that's part of my emotional defense. I always live in the future. My mind is always in the next space, and I think as a child, that's how I learned to avoid the pain of a present moment. - Counting, three, two. - Oh, God. - Good start, good start, good start. I've see pictures from that week and everything, and it's like, it was such a deeply... painful goodbye. - Being pulled away from these people was really difficult. I loved being with them, and we'd also gone through something so life-changing for all of us, so we were bonded in this way. - I wasn't in the last scene. I was in one of the early scenes, and right after I did my scene, I took a deep breath, and I waited for the director to say, "Clear, and moving on," and when he said, "Moving on," I slowly walked off the set, went in the dressing room, grabbed my bag, got in the car, and drove to the airport and flew home. I couldn't... I couldn't do it. - All of my hu... I mean, 11 to 17, it's such a huge... You know, you grow so much during that time. I did it all with them, and when I saw that stage empty, it was just like... I could barely breathe. - It didn't come to a head until the last scene shooting, and we knew that this was the last time we were gonna hug these people on this set. - Leaving is like leaving a grand, old friend. - Having to walk off the set, that was hard. You know, it was like I was out of my body, watching myself walk all the way out and not stopping, and then I was out of frame, and I was done. - I remember that when it was all said and done, I couldn't stop crying. - You okay? - Yeah, yeah, no, no, I'm cool. I'm cool, Uncle Phil. You know, it's just when I first came out here, you know, I was a relative. Been here for the past six years, like, we've been family. I just don't wanna go back to being just a relative again. I mean, I lived without a father and without brothers and sisters and all of that. I like this life better. - Hey, who turned out the lights? Where is everybody? d - I am definitely gonna miss you, C. d - We've been a part of creating something that has touched millions and millions of hearts around the world, and on this set I learned how to lead my life, you know? I figured out who I wanted to be on this set with all of you making this show, so... This was family. - This is family. - This is family. - I love you guys so much. You have no idea. I think... no, you do. - I think the continuing legacy for "Fresh Prince" will simply be that we changed television in a positive way and that we will go down in history as one of the best to have ever done it. - I mean, it's... It's become legendary. It has become really, really special. - We were so fortunate. It was like no experience ever, but I had it. - We had no idea that it was gonna be the iconic show that it became. - While we were filming this, you know, Will tweeted out a picture, and I saw a lot of posts about the picture, and a lot of people responded, and people said, #BlackExcellence, right? And it made me think about what our show meant to people and why it's lasted so long, and I don't want it to be mistaken that the excellence part is the wealth. That part is the fantasy. The excellence was the way that we loved each other. - You know, the... the thing that's difficult is that, you know, we're a family, you know? Of course it's a TV show, and, you know, we're only playing a family, but you really develop family-like relationships. You know, it was such a beautiful way to have these memories and to be able to say goodbye to this show and to this section of our lives with dignity. - I think we all... You know, to an extent, we've all gone off and lived our lives, but there will always be a piece of all of us in that living room, and it was nice for all of us to share it for one more day. - Y'all ready? Let's go, let's go! Hit it, Snazz! ["The Fresh Prince - One thing that always bugged me about the show... Nothing bugged me about the show. Well, I guess the one thing that bugged me is that... [Tom Jones' - Uh-oh. - Oh! - We doing it? - What you got? What you got? What you got? - When are we doing it? - I never could do this. I never could do this. - You gotta start right here. - Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! - Now do the steps. - There it is right there, y'all. Bring it in right there. On three. One, two, three! Yes! D f - Are we done? - That's it. - That's it? - That's it. - Oh. - Thank you. - See you in ten years.
