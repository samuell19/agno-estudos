Okay? Hey, Johnny. Hey, Deke. You know, I'm sorry I missed you last night. I was on my way to the club, when these three girls pull up to me, right, asking me directions to the Omega Tunnel, right. So I say, you know, I'll show them, right. The next thing I know, they're going through the tunnel, man, with me still in the car. I ended up in a mobile home they have parked in the woods off the interstate. Uh, so how about you, you score last night, man? What the fuck was I doing, man, huh? Playing hockey? Jesus, what's the matter with you, man? What's the matter with me? I just pawned my guitar, that's what. - Why? - So I could have something else to eat besides goddamned carrots, you know? I'll tell you, man, if I had a gun right now... I'd do something. - Like what? - Like... Do you see that barber shop over there, man? I bet there's 300 dollars sitting in the register. We walk in, show him the gun, they give us the cash, right? Yeah, man. Hey, hey, that's not a bad idea, Johnny. I know. I could get my guitar out of hock... Hey, man, I could get me a new keyboard. Oh! We would start the band. So when are we gonna get the band started, man? I just told you, as soon as we get a gun. Listen. You know, I know this guy, man, needs his apartment painted, you know? So, like, you help me, I split it with you, 50-50. 50-50? No. These hands were not made to hold a goddamned paintbrush. All right, you know what's best. That I do. All right, so I'll see you later on tonight, man, - at the club. - No, I'm not going. That place is starting to bug me. No, man. Hey, hey, hey. You just need luck in rollin' the dice, man. I mean, you bound to come up seven sooner or later. Johnny? Johnny Suede? ♪ Overactive ♪ Active ♪ Active ♪ Active ♪ Active Freak! Slick. Yeah, we need to talk. Really, we need to talk. I'd like to talk to you too, Slick, but I can't right now. What do you mean, you can't talk to me? When? I don't know, man. I'm totally booked. This record company of mine, man, they are on my ass to get this album out. Yeah, well, I need my money, man. I mean, I need my money. Yeah, well, I sympathize, dude. Yeah. You know, with those shoes on, you remind me of a prince in a fairytale. Yeah? Well, with that pink dress on, you remind me of a strawberry ice cream cone. Looking for something? Yeah, I just ordered a beer, and now it's gone. I'll buy you one. May I have a beer, please? Thanks. Are you in a band? Mm-hmm. I knew it. I saw you at the Red Hammock last week. No, we haven't played there yet. You should. I go all the time, my mom's in the record business. Really? Yeah, but the real reason I go is because I write poetry. And it inspires me, and anyway a lot of people say that music and poetry are a lot alike. I've always thought so. What's the name of your band again? I'm not supposed to go to that club. Why not? It really upsets my boyfriend. Who's Flip? He's my boyfriend. Gloom and darkness Are my constant shadows Where'er I go They're sure to follow O prince of dreams On horse of white Please bring me your Blinding beams of light God, that's beautiful! Um, listen, I'd better be going. Why? Well, I don't feel right herewith your boyfriend and all. Yeah, he's pretty jealous. He'd go crazy if he found you here. Is he coming over? Oh, I hope not. I'm a little afraid of him. Why? Well, he hits me sometimes. Do you think maybe you could stay? What about her boyfriend? She's gonna dump him. Yeah, but she's gotta take it easy because... Well, he's got kind of a temper. - Uh-huh. - You know? He hits her and shit, leaves black and blue marks on her. - Jesus! - Yeah. What's this guy's problem? I don't know, he's just crazy, I guess. He's a famous photographer, Flip Doubt. Flip Doubt? That's what she said. What a fucking idiot, man. Yeah, and the fucking idiot lives right across the street. Too bad, Johnny. I mean, now you've got to start sneaking around and shit, man. Whoa. Whoa, are you finished? I don't sneak around, man, you know that. Come on. No, we worked outta schedule. He'll see her Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and I'll see her Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. - See? - What about Sunday? Well, she's leaving that for herself, you know? Hmm.Yeah. I was thinking, if you float me that 40 bucks, I'll get my guitar outta hock, we're rehearsing on Sunday. You're serious, Johnny? Said I was gonna start a band, that's what I'm gonna do. Yep. You got any songs? - No! - No? You better get on it. I mean, I got a couple, but we gotta... we gotta get it going. I didn't tell you the best part. You ready? Yeah? Darlette's mom... works for High Tone Records' producer. Oh, now, that's smooth, Johnny. That is smooth, man. But I'm not gonna push it. I mean, you know me, Mr. Easy-Going.

No, I'm not sick. Um, then what's the matter? Flip slapped me again last night. What for? No reason. That's it. I'm gonna teach that fucking scum bag about slapping women around.

Well, it's kinda boring. Well, hey, I'll just take it off then. Do you have any Freak Storm? Who? Freak Storm. He's great. Flip has all his records. Never heard of him. I thought you said this plant didn't need much attention. Well, have you been watering it? Of course I've been watering it. I think it was dead when you gave it to me. I wouldn't give you a dead plant. Hey, does this plant look dead or not? Where are you going? Deke called. Gonna go grab a beer. Can I wait upstairs until you come back? If you want. Where are you from, Johnny? Oh, nowhere in particular, Mrs. Fontaine. I assume you were born somewhere? North Dakota. But I only lived there a month. Like a Rolling Stone. You know, with the Dakotas being primarily settled by Swedish emigrants, I'm wondering if the original pronunciation of your name isn't "Swede." Jan Swede. No, it's Suede, Mr. Fontaine. Always has been, and it always will be. Uh, Dalton is not Mr. Fontaine, Johnny. - He's not? - I'm... I'm a friend, John. A mere friend. Where's your dad? - Gone. - Gone? Mr. Fontaine disappeared shortly before Darlette's fifth birthday. About a month later, the divorce papers arrived postmarked Buenos Aires, and I haven't seen or heard from him since. Well, he's probably living in a tree house somewhere surrounded by a bevy of bare breasted young... See, I was kind of a lone wolf in my day. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. I rambled wild, drank hard, loved hard. Do you know what I'm saying? Oh, I do. I know you do, you rascal. To the lone wolf. What are you toasting, Dalton? Animal behavior, my dear. Have some coffee. All righty. Mrs. Fontaine, is that Nancy Sinatra in that picture there? No, that's me. That's amazing, because I thought... Why, you look just like Nancy Sinatra. What are you doing with Frankie Lindou? Frankie gave High Tone its first gold record. "Let's Live on Love," right? Well, I'd have thought he was before your time. Well, Mrs. Fontaine, good music has no time. That's my philosophy. Darlette tells me that you're a musician yourself. What kind of music do you play? Well, I actually don't have a name for it. I just pick up my guitar and play. Whatever comes out is what it is. Kind of free-form, experimental. Is that what you're saying, John? Not exactly, Dalt. Johnny has a beautiful voice, and he writes all his own songs. How sweet. You've already got a fan. I assume you have a tape? Not on me. Well, send it to me next week, and maybe I can persuade Jazz Collins, our new talent director, to give it a listen. Thank you very much. There's only one thing I ask in return. It's that you let me try on one of those beautiful shoes. Babe, what's the matter? Darling... I told you she hates me. She always has. She's trying to take you away from me. No way, babe. Never happen. My father didn't disappear. She drove him away. Because she knew how much I loved him. When I was little, I used to lie here staring at the door, praying that it would open... and he'd be thereto take me away forever. Oh babe, I'm never gonna leave you. I thought... Will you take me home? Ahh. Babe... you look so beautiful right now Thanks. Any more crackers? Um, do you have any more tea? No? Did I ever show you this picture? No. Wow, that's a great picture. Who took it? Flip. We used to have so much fun, dressing up and taking pictures of each other. Yeah? Babe, it's a little hard for me to understand how you could be having so much fun with a guy who's supposed to be beating the shit out of you. Well, I'm sorry, Johnny. But we had fun. What do you want me to say? Well, maybe I should slap you a couple times, and we'll have some fun too. I can't believe that you said that. I was just joking. I would never. It's over, Johnny. What? I can't pretend anymore. I don't love you. I'm sorry, Johnny, but I'm not gonna be able to see you again. - No! - Goodbye, Johnny. Johnny. Johnny! So you Ina relationship yet? No, not yet, but I'm working on it. Yeah, good for you. It's just a matter of time. Oh, yeah, she's out there... somewhere. You know what? You're right, she is out there. In fact, I just saw her in the next train. She's all dressed up like Cinderella, asking everybody if they've seen a stupid fucking idiot who looks like you. Hey! What the hell are you doing? Huh? - Man, I'm gonna get you for this. - Shut up! You wait, sucker! You're gonna die! Next time, you keep your nose out of other people's business. Hey! Hey, are you all right? You okay? - I oughta kick your fucking ass! - What? You're a real big fucking man, you know, picking on a little goddamned kid! That wasn't a kid, that was a guy, and he was trying to look up your dress. - Get the fuck out of here! - He had a little antenna, and he was trying to lift up your dress. I didn't see any fucking antenna. Where? You didn't see any antenna and nothing happened here, and your underwear, excuse me for saying so, was not white with little blue rabbits on it. Hey! Hey, what? I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. I thought you pushed him down the stairs. - I'm sorry. - No, I didn't push him. He tripped over my foot. It's a good thing he didn't have a knife, you know? Oh, I'm not worried about knives. With these shoes on, I'm pretty light on my feet. What are these, bedroom slippers? No, they're not bedroom slippers. Look! They're one of a kind, black suede shoes. My name's Suede, by the way. Johnny Suede. You're kidding me, right? No, I'm not kidding. Why would I be kidding? Yvonne! Okay! That's your name, huh, Yvonne? Yeah.Yvonne. Why, what about it? Yvonne. I knew a girl named Yvonne. Yeah, she was a dancer at the Blue Kitten Lounge. Yvonne! I gotta go. Who is that guy? It's, uh... a friend. See, I was just gonna say he looks kinda like a friend. I gotta go. My band's practicing across the street. Right. Maybe you'd like to come by? I, um... I can't.I gotta go. All right. But do me a favor. Try to be a little more careful, because I hate to say it, but there are guys around here who would like to do a lot more than look up your dress. Okay. So where'd you get that suit? Man, that's nice. I was gonna check out Flip last night. - Where's she at? - She went back to London. Guys, guys, I'm sorry I'm late. You're not gonna believe what happened. I'm coming off the subway, this crazy guy, he pulls a knife on me, this long. What'd you do, man? Kicked that fucker down the stairs, that's what I did. Did you hear about that guy got pushed in front of that train? - Killed? - Cut his arm off. I've seen a cat cut half in two once. You saw it happen? No, but I've seen 'em put him in two bags, though. All right, boys, let's make some music, huh? Let's start with "Midtown." One and a-two, you... Hold it. Hold it, guys. Hi. You showed up. Hey, have a seat. Guys, this is Yvonne.

No, man, I'm gonna stick around. I'll call you later. So, what'd you think? Is there a phone around here? I really should call my friend. Come on, I can take criticism. Well, I don't... really know that much. Forget it. I know what you're trying to say, and I agree with you. These guys are terrible. I mean, Deke, he's no help. He thinks being in a band is all fun and games. I write all the songs, I set up all the rehearsals. God! I mean, the way I feel like right now, I'm ready to give the whole thing up. Oh, don't do that. Why not? I liked the song. I'm not really sure what it's about, but I liked it. I just think that you guys need a little more practice, that's all. You've got a pretty good voice. Yeah? I think so. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I am being too hard on these guys. Yeah. I just can't help it, you know? I mean, this is my life. You know what I can tell about you? You got a really good head on your shoulders. - Do I? - Mm-hmm. Yeah, I like that. Sit down, pal, I've got us some good news. Oh, yeah, so do I. Conan's brother's getting married, and he wants us to play at his wedding. Fifty bucks a piece, man. That's great, man. That's great. Uh... Did B-Bop call you? - No, why? - Uh... 'Cause he's got this gig on this cruise ship, and he's like leaving tomorrow, you know? For how long? Three months, man. Unbelievable. Just when things are starting to click, you know? Yeah, but can't we do the gig without him? No, man. I'm not playing without a goddamned bass player. Yeah. I guess, you know, I'll tell that photographer that we'll paint his studio. Oh, man, I'm sick of that shit. Well, I guess it's time we took a trip to the barber shop. What are you talking about, man? Barber shops? Thought you said you had some good news. That's what I'm trying to tell you, Johnny. Heh, heh. Is it loaded? No, he didn't have any bullets. Okay. We gotta find us some bullets... for a .38. That's the plan, okay? Yeah. Um, the brother said I should hold on to it. Oh, okay. So let's go to the club tonight, now that you're a free man again. I got plans tonight. - You're seeing Darlette? - Yvonne. Yeah, I was thinking I might go up to her place tonight for some dinner. You know, I went out with this schoolteacher once, man. She's not a schoolteacher though. She works with retarded kids and shit. I mean, that's a big difference. Yeah.Yeah. He said that he was gonna divorce his wife, but he had to wait for the right time, you know? So, two years later, he was still waiting, so I just left. I didn't even say goodbye or leave a note or anything. Did you ever live with anybody? Yeah, sure. Say, this is some good meatloaf. It's not even done. No, parts of it are.Yeah. Why don't I... I'll just put it back... I'll put it back in the oven, you know? Okay? You know what? That's okay. Because, uh... it's getting late, and I should be moving along. It's 9:30. Hard to believe, isn't it? Um, did I say something wrong? No... No, no. I have a lot on my mind, that's all. This thing with B-Bop, it's really upsetting and... Oh, well, okay. Well, thanks for coming up. Hey, thank you. And I'll call you and... we'll do it again some... How come you always have black and blue marks on you? Um, kids. They just get carried away sometimes. A kid did that to you? I hope you smacked him back. Actually, I just, you know, poked his eye out. No, you didn't. God! That's really funny, Yvonne. I guess I'm in a funny mood. Okay. So long. So long. What the hell, I might as well make it a real kiss, huh? Might as well. So I'll see you. Bye. I'm gonna help myself to some more meatloaf, - if you don't mind. - Could you... hold on a second? Mm-hmm, why? My turn. Okay. Uh, hold it. What? Um, what are you doing? What does it feel like I'm doing? It feels like you're trying to pick up a watermelon seed. Well, do it your damn self then. Don't be an idiot. Come here. What? Come here, give me your hand. Come here. Come here. Come on. Okay, you feel that? Yes. That is not it... Okay? You feel that? Mm-hmm. That's it. This is it? But this is not it. - Right. - This is it? But this is not it. Yes. See, where I made my mistake with Darlette, man, is I let her see my hand, you know? I mean, as soon as she found out that I liked her, she flew off like a damn bird. Oh, man, she'll hit the ground one day, you know? Oh, I know she will, but my point is is that I learned an extremely valuable lesson here, see? I mean, now, with Yvonne, I'm making sure she knows I can take it or leave it. That's right, man. That's the way it is, Johnny. Just let 'em come to you, man, you know? I went to her class the other day, you know, just to get a glimpse of her lifestyle, and the moment I walk in, the kids start crawling all over me, you know? Messing up my clothes, messing up my hair, and then this girl comes up, for no reason, rips the pocket off my favorite shirt, you know? I was so pissed, I just cut out of there, man, you know? I didn't even say, "Goodbye," you know? - Take it or leave it, right? - Exactly. And that's the way I'm handling this one, man. Strictly plutonic. You're not making love, man? Well, of course we're making love. God. You should have seen me the other night, man. I was like a wild man or something. I was doing all kinds of things, man. Oh, yeah? Like what? Like, well, for starters, she showed me where that little button is inside there, you know? You didn't know where that was, man? Yeah, but, yeah, I knew where it was, but now, man, I can find it in the dark if I have to, and that is a good thing for a guy to know. Mm-hmm. You know, Johnny, I'm glad we had this conversation. Anytime. Sorry, man, I didn't mean to laugh, but I really am glad we had this conversation. Me too. Phew. Deke, turn on your TV quick, man. There's this old cowboy movie on with nobody in it but midgets. You're kidding me. Yeah, man. Even the horses are midgets. Let me look. Oh, damn. You just missed it. It's over. Hmm. Mm-hmm? Mm? Yeah, I'm almost ready. Hey, is the blonde over there? Yeah, she's here, man. Yeah? You didn't tell her I wanted to meet her, did...? Good. All right. Yeah, just yell up to the window when you get here. Who is it? It's Yvonne. Oh, God. I'm coming. Hi, what a great surprise. Am I disturbing you? No, go in. - Yeah? - Yeah. I was just getting ready to go out with some friends. What, you just happened to be in the neighborhood? No, I planned this, actually. Good. It's a hairdryer. Yeah. Doesn't work though. That's too bad. Listen, are you avoiding me? Why would I be avoiding you? No. God. 'Cause I haven't heard from you in a week. Well, I've been really busy, you know, babe? Practicing and... What, are you still pissed about Ginger ripping your shirt? No. No. I mean, I was pissed, you know, for a second. It's my favorite shirt. Well, she made this for you. Oh, that's really Ni... Oh, that's real funny, you know? Kid rips my shirt, and she calls me a shit. - That's hysterical. - It's supposed to be "shirt." See. "Sorry I ripped your shirt." Oh, that's very, very nice. Mm-hmm. Oh, and this is from me and the rest of the class. Johnny! Just a sec. Johnny! Hey, Deke, I'll be down in a second. Come on, man, hurry up, the girls' legs are getting cold. Hi. What happened to your friends? I remembered I didn't like them very much. And I thought, hell, I haven't seen Yvonne in a while. Maybe I could go up there and take her out, my treat. Oh, thanks, but I've already eaten. Eating? No. I mean dancing. No, no. I got to get up in the morning, you know? We don't have to stay out late. You say the word, I'll have you home in a flash. I'll wait out here while you get dressed. What are you, a fucking choir boy? Okay. - Is that all? - What? I thought you were gonna put some of that black stuff around your eyes. Eyeliner? All the girls are wearing it at the club. Pretty sexy. Oh. Well, I don't wear eyeliner. - Really? Why not? - I don't like it. That's a pretty good reason. What shoes should I wear? Either one. Well, do you like these? Yeah, they're all right. Do you like these better? What, babe, you were dressing yourself long before I came along, so why stop now? Just asking you which shoes you like. And I'm just saying wear the ones you like best, okay? Great. Why don't you tell me what shoes you like better? 'Cause I guess I don't like either ones. Look... Hey! They're the only fucking shoes that I have, okay? This is the way I dress. And, you know, goddamn it, I don't want any shit around my eyes. Okay. What's the big deal? No big deal. Let's just stop seeing each other, all right? Why? Because it's very obvious to me that there's nothing about me that you like. Well, if it's so obvious, then what... what the hell am I doing standing here then, huh? I don't have any idea. Well, then I guess I have to spell it out for you. I'm standing here... 'cause I like you. But you sure have a funny way of showing it. Hey, hey. Shh, shh. You know, you're right. You have the kind of eyes that don't need any makeup at all. - Shut up. - No, I'm serious. Look, hey, I'm serious. You're really beautiful. I'm sorry I threw the shoe at you. It's okay. It's all right. Just please don't do it again, because I really hate it when people throw shoes at me. I won't. I just wanted to tell you. I'm sorry, you know? I know I was really wrong and everything, but I'm just really... Hey! You got a smoke? No, I'm out. You're Freak Storm, huh? That's right. I seen you somewhere before. What's your name? Johnny. Johnny Suede. What are you doing back here, Freak? I saw someone I didn't want to see. Oh. Nice little shoes you got there, Johnny. Yeah. Thanks. I like your boots. Where'd you get 'em? I found 'em when I was living out in Wyoming. What were you doing in Wyoming? I've been all over, man. - Me too. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah? I was born in a goddamn motel room. Reall...? Oh, your dad was a traveling salesman, huh? Daddy? I don't know too much about my daddy except he shot a man five minutes after I was born. What? You kidding? No, I'm not fucking kidding. Even tried to write a song about it once. I just couldn't finish it. It went sort of like this. ♪ I was born In a motel room ♪ ♪ The night Daddy lost his job ♪ ♪ Just after one ♪ He pulled a gun ♪ And blew the brains Out of some poor slob ♪ ♪ They call me mamma ♪ They call me mamma ♪ They call me Mamma's boy ♪ ♪ But I don't care ♪ I'll be a mamma ♪ I'll be a mamma ♪ I've been a mamma's boy ♪ Since daddy got the ♪ Electric chair That's a beautiful song, Freak. No, it ain't. It's an old piece of bone. No, man, you should finish it. I can't. It's just too damn personal. Did your daddy really get the chair? Well, Johnny, I don't really like talking about that. I can understand that. You really like that song, Johnny? Yeah. I do a lot. You can have it. Thanks. Thanks, Freak. You know, I'm trying to start a band myself. Oh, good for you.Yeah. High Tone was interested for a while, but that kind of fell through. Mm-hmm, yeah, I sympathize with that. It's hard, you know? I sympathize, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Sometimes I just... I feel like giving up. - Do you, Johnny? - Mm-hmm. Yeah, I do, Freak. Well, I like you. I want to turn you onto something. Check this out. What is it? This cat, Rudy, is a friend of mine. He did my first album. - You got a tape? - Uh-huh. Well, send it to him right away and make sure you send cash. Is that safe? Sure, man, you just wrap it up in tinfoil. Hey, wait a minute. I'm gonna go and see this guy, Rudy, tomorrow. If you give me the money, then I can give it to him. Hey, that's great. That's fine by me. I got it. - You give it to him, man. - Why? I don't have to bother with that. Oh, hell, I'll give it to him. I'll tell him you're a friend of mine. He'll give you special treatment. Okay. - Thanks, Freak. - Don't mention it. This is great. Don't mention it. Maybe one day you can do me a favor. Here... have some chicken. I can't, Freak, I gotta split. - You gotta split? - Uh-huh. I start your fucking career for you and you've got to split? That's why your life's going fucking nowhere, Johnny, 'cause you don't know how to show a bit of goddamn gratitude. No, I'm grateful, Freak, really. I am. I'm... Mmm, this is good chicken. Well, it should be, man, I only found it this morning.

She still loves you. Does she? She talks about you all the time. I told you I'd get you. Didn't I? Johnny. How do you feel? Terrible. Wow, what's that smell? I made some soup. Do you want some? What kind? Vegetable. What kind of vegetables? Do you want some soup or not? Hm, okay, I'll have some soup. Aren't you supposed to be at school? Yeah, I... I took the day off. I hope you know shaving your face isn't like shaving your legs. Relax, would you? Have you done this before? Once or twice. - Mm-hmm? - Mm-hmm. With that married guy? You're awful curious. Were you guys in the tub? No. We were in a Jacuzzi. Mm-hmm. Anything else you want to tell me? Just this. You keep asking me stupid questions and I'm gonna smack you. Ooh, big talk for a girl. Not if she's got a razor in one hand and your balls in the other. Not if I got a bar of soap ready to bounce off your head. God. God. Now, that's funny. I hope you know shaving a leg is not like shaving a face. Relax, will you, I've done this a million times. You're going the wrong way. Look, lady, you go your way, I'll go my way. I love you, Johnny. Thanks. All right. For moving in. Against moving in. Now, I would suggest that you start with the reasons for moving in, man, 'cause those are the hardest. Okay, let me have a couple. Okay. She's got a color TV. There you go. Color TV. All right, next? Um... Oh, she's got an extra room she says I can play my guitar in, kind of like my own private room. Hmm, now, that's nice. That's nice. Private room. Oh, yeah. Next? She's always got things lying around to eat, you know? Like, nuts and crackers and shit. Hey, man, you could eat 'em while you watch TV. - You know what I'm saying? - Oh, yeah. So we'll call that snacks, okay? Anything else? No, no. Let's proceed to the reasons against. If I moved in with her, I'd be locked up with her 24 hours a day, you know? Go to bed, there she is. Wake up, there she is again. So, what, you're saying you feel like...? I'd feel like I was in prison. Okay, prison similarities. Good. - Um... - Next? Well, I couldn't do any of the things a guy does, you know? I mean, say I wanted to walk around in my underwear. No, say I had to make a fart. I'd probably have to go into my private room just to make a fart. Yeah, you probably would, man, you know? Okay, things... things a guy does. Okay, next? She threw a shoe at me once. Oh, that's bad. That's very bad. Uh, shoe-throwing tendencies. Okay, how many is that? Well, it's tied up, three to three. Okay. Let's face it, she is probably the exact opposite type of girl I would normally date, you know? She's got a weird job, she dresses funny. She can't even put on makeup, man. Opposite types. That's us. Well, there it is, pal. Three reasons for. Four reasons against. - I guess that's it. - Hey, numbers don't lie. And hey, just because I don't move in with her, doesn't mean I can't still see her, right? Hey, hell, no, man. I mean, 'cause I do like the girl. Yeah, sometimes, you know, when I'm just sitting around, she'll start rubbing my ear real soft. I like that. Whoa, that's not a reason for, man. I don't know, man. I mean, the way you described it makes me want to meet a girl like that. It's tied up again, Johnny. I know, I know. Just, shh, I got to think. Uh... Okay, see that, color TV? - Are you sure? - Positive. Now I just got to find a way to break it to her. What are you thinking about? Well, I guess I've been thinking about a few things. What I want to say... is... Excuse me. Excuse me, painter.Painter. Be so kind as to turn that down. Where's he get off calling me "painter," man, hm? I don't know. Maybe he thought you were painting the place. Yeah, well, I'll tell you something. This is the last time I'll let you talk me into this shit. You don't like the man, why don't you just go home? Home. Right. Oh, uh... Can I help you with something? Yes sir, you can get out of the way, so I may open the door. Oh, look, I prefer that you don't use this bathroom. Okay. Which one should I use? Well, if I'm not mistaken, there's a cozy little gas station around the corner. Fine. Thanks. You know, you'll find the rear door more convenient. Scumbag won't even let me use his bathroom. Relax. Piss in a bucket, man. Right. Where? In the closet. Deke? Where's your gun? In my coat. Why? Where'd you get that? Come on. What are you doing? Oh, shut the fuck up. What? Just talking. Well, that's nice. I don't believe this. What? This wall is covered with nibs. What are nibs? This fuzzy little item is a nib. It's a hair from your cheaper than cheap bargain basement rollers which literally are falling apart on my walls. Here's one. And there's another. Hey, we just painted that, man. You're going to have to sand this down and repaint the entire surface. It's one thing I detest, it's fuzzy little nibs all over my wall. Suck on this. What did you say? He said, "Mark those nibs." He did not. He said, "Suck my dick." No, no, no. He said, "Mark those nibs." That way we can start sanding right away, sir. You bet your sweet ass I'm gonna mark these nibs. Ah, come on, man. It was just a joke. No, hey, hey, tomorrow, man, just, just, just, just don't... Don't even look at the guy, man. Just paint the walls so we can get the hell out of there. All right. Deal. Today's my birthday, man. Yeah, happy birthday. Oh, come on. Look, I might as well tell you now. I joined a band. When? Last week. I got tired of waiting around, man. You, uh... You pissed off? No. No, man. Why should I be pissed off? Well, we were gonna start one together, you know? Forget it. Hey, man, you got five bucks I can borrow? I got to pick some things up on the way home. So she's got you doing the shopping now, huh? That's... That's really funny, man. What? You know what. I'll tell you something. I'm getting a little sick of your insinuations. Look, man, I'm just trying to make conversation, all right? You don't like it, go talk to someone else. You had the beer, that's two dollars, pal. I can't believe it, man. It's my fucking birthday and some guy who's supposed to be my best friend can't even buy me a fucking beer. Uh, I know this is really gonna sound silly and I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I saw you on the train and I just wanted to tell you you had the most beautiful legs I'd ever seen. Thanks for everything. I had a lovely time. Wait a second. What? You idiot motherfucker son-of-a-bitch! - Yvonne? - Honey. - Am I glad to see you. - Where have you been? - Oh, you're not gonna believe it. - What, are you all right? Yeah, I'm okay, but this poor guy on the train, this fat guy, got shot. Right in the head. Oh, God. Oh, my God. Was he killed? No, but he was hurt pretty bad. - Oh, well, wha... - And then, of course, the cops had to keep everybody down there, asking the same questions over and over and over. Well, why didn't you call me? I tried. I tried. I said, "Cops, I got to use a phone." They wouldn't even let me make a call, can you believe it? - Those fucking assholes. - I know, I know. So I ran all the way home 'cause I knew you'd be worried. Oh, you must be starved, are you? I'm glad you're okay. I have dinner in the fridge. Yeah, actually, I need to take a shower. All right. Well, you do smell kind of ripe. You bought me a cake. Hell, baby, I made it. You made me a cake? Are you sure you're okay? Yeah, I'm okay, seeing I just saw a guy get his head blown off. Look at all the presents. What is this? Christmas? Open it. Yeah? No, I'm gonna wait till we have our cake. I can't believe you did all this, babe. This is perfect. What have you done? Me? Nothing, nothing. Deke must have put those there as some kind of birthday joke. I'll tell you, that guy's got a sick sense of humor. Stop it, Johnny, I could smell it all over you as soon as you walked in the door. Hey, I don't know what you smell, but I smell a guy who's been working his ass off all day. You fucked somebody, okay? Now cut your shit. Why? Why? You just tell me why you did it. The one thing I can say is that I know you're gonna think this is stupid. But... It felt like... something was behind me all day, you know? Pushing and shoving me. Do you know what I mean? No. Like a giant hand. Pushing me from behind and I couldn't stop. And I started following this girl. Nothing special about her, really, but every time I tried to stop, that giant hand gave me another shove, you know? And somehow I ended up in her kitchen eating dinner. She cooked you dinner? Yeah. See what I mean? The whole thing, it... It was like a dream and... and... And then we were in bed, but it's not like I enjoyed it or anything. But for the first time in my life, I felt like I was home. Well, Johnny, that's about the biggest pile of shit I've ever heard in my life. Thanks, Yvonne. I try to explain how I feel, and you don't even try to understand. Oh, no, no, no. I understand. You saw a girl. You fucked her. She made you feel at home, and then you lied to me about the whole fucking thing. I never said she made me feel at home. I said it felt like I was home. - Get out. - What? I can't even look at your fucking face. - Get out! - Fine. I am out of here, man. You think I need this shit? No. I am my own man. You are a lying piece of shit. No. You know what I am? I'm stupid for ever letting you talk me into moving into this dump in the first place. I got places I want to go. I got things I want to do. Do you think I want to be stuck here with a chick who can't even put on fucking makeup? No! Hey! Hey! Fuck you. Didn't I tell you about throwing shoes? Didn't I? Hey, has Deke been in? I want to see him. What are you gonna have? What's on the house? Shingles. Freak! Freak, how you doing, man? - Who might you be then? - It's Johnny. It's Johnny Suede. We talked. You look good. Your hair's different. No, man, no. It's the same. Well, something's changed. Maybe it's 'cause you look so strung out. Yeah, I guess I am a little. I just had this fight with my girlfriend, man. What, she stabbed you? No, no. It's just a scratch, you know? She threw a shoe at me though, man, for no reason. Hey, man, I'd rather have a girl fucking stab me than throw a shoe at me. Yeah, I know. It pissed me off so much, I, uh, you know... I did something kind of crazy, man. You hit her? Yeah. I... just once. And not that hard or anything. You know, it's crazy. I never hit a girl before, man. Oh, a guy, a girl, what's the fucking difference, man? The point is you did the right thing. You think so? She tried to fucking stab you. Right. Hey, did you give Rudy that $20 of mine? Rudy? Yeah, Rudy, the guy who did the record, who cut your first record. I said I'd give him the $20.I gave him the fucking $20. That's cool. It's just, uh, well, I never sent the tape. I sympathize with you, dude, but that ain't my problem. Right. Yeah, that's okay, you know. It's just going to make it kind of hard to get a hotel room tonight, so, you know... Johnny... You can crash at my place. Of course, me and my babe get the bedroom, but you can have the living room. Great. That'd really be great. Look at her, man. Waiting for me like a little trained poodle. Hey, babe. I'd like you to meet an old friend of mine. Johnny! Oh, you two know each other. Oh, good. 'Cause Johnny's gonna be staying with us for a couple of days. Hey, where are you going? Hey. Hi. Hi. I've been looking all over for you. Deke saw you from across the street. We've been asking everybody if they saw a guy with one suede shoe on that looks like this. Where did you find it? On the roof of a car. I looked for over 20 minutes for this thing. I can't believe you found it. What happened to you? I don't know. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. No.Yes, yes. I'm, uh, sorry.
