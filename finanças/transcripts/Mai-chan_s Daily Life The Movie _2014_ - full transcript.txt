If I could die like this, how easy would my life be? Use this as you are told. Look. Do it here. I can't do it. You're nothing but trouble. Ms. Kaede, please forgive me.

The costume is cute and... 500,000 yen a month! A live-in job with three meals provided. Wow, great. They're looking for a real maid to work for them. It's not for a maid cosplay. Wow. There are some conditions. Let's see. I meet that one. I meet that one. This might be good! Maybe I should apply for this. ONE WEEK LATER YOUR MAID INTERVIEW INFORMATION Dear Ms. Miyako, Here is your maid interview information. I hope this letter finds you well. Thank you for sending your profile and photos for our consideration. Please be advised that you have passed our first screening. Please find information below regarding the second screening, an in-person interview. We hope you will oblige us with your presence. If the date is not convenient for you, please inform the Head Maid, Kaede, so that we can make other arrangements. Below you will find a map from the nearest station to the Maruyama residence. Please use it for your reference. It's become less than a road. Is this the right way? It's still within Metropolitan Tokyo, but what a remote place. Ouch! It hurts. CHAPTER 2 PHYSICAL EXAMINATION FOR BEING A MAID Congratulations. You're hired, Miyako. Serve him well and work hard. I will. Thank you very much. STARTING A NEW LIFE AS A MAID By the way, we have another live-in maid. Mai. Mai! Yes! She's new. Her name is Miyako. Look after her well. Yes. So I'll call you Miyako-chan, right? Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. You're my senior maid. Your senior maid? Ask me if you need anything. MAI, THE SENIOR MAID We have to clean this room carefully. Yes. All the decorations on these shelves are expensive. Be careful not to break them. Yes, I will be. Carefully wipe all the art pieces on the wall. Yes, I will. Look, Miyako-chan, this picture is super cute, isn't it? What? Yes, it is cute. That's my favorite. This light bulb sometimes burns out. Please check it carefully. If it burns out, replace it. This tends to collect a lot of dust. Please wipe it carefully. Yes, I will. On to the next room. This is our master's favorite room. It's dark in here, so watch your step. Don't get lazy about cleaning here just because it's dark. Ms. Kaede checks afterwards. So don't be lazy about cleaning here. No, I won't. This is not a bench. Even if you're tired from cleaning, you mustn't sit on it to have a rest. Mr. Kaede would get angry. This room is very large. Clean it from one corner to the other. BREAKFAST FOR MAIDS Mai, your master is here. We must greet our master when he comes into the dining room. Watch me. My master. Do as I do. My master. You two may eat. Mai, the ears and tails. - Put them on now. - Yes. Miyako-chan, do as I do. Okay. On the back of your neck. - Mai! - Yes? Thank you for the meal, my master. Do as I do. Say, “Thank you for the meal, my master.” I will. Thank you for the meal, my master. Can you drink it well? - Are you all right? - Yes, all right. That's good. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Ms. Kaede. Clean up after yourself, Mai. Miyako-chan, I can see your underwear. I'm sorry. Our master doesn't like indecency, like that. - I'll be careful. - Be careful. Your fingers! Oops! We must finish cleaning quickly. Hurry up, Miyako-chan. Hurry up now. I'm thirsty. I need to get some water. Ms. Kaede. Please punish Mai the bad girl. Ms. Kaede. Please punish Mai the bad girl. Ms. Kaede. Please eat whatever part of me that pleases you. Let's see. Today I'm going to take your delicious eyeball. What a dreadful place I've found myself in. No, this can't be real. It must have been a dream. But when I saw Mai getting stabbed in the eye with a fork... for some reason, I was so... How can I put it? I was so... Maybe I'm still in a dream. What is it that I'm feeling now? MAI'S SECRET Mai? Mai? I'm sorry I'm not dressed. Mai. It was real, Mai, what happened to your eye. Don't you need to go to the hospital? I saw you getting stabbed in the eye by Ms. Kaede last night. It was so horrible I thought it was a dream. But it was real, wasn't it? I'm okay with it. Look. What? You lost that eye! I did. I have a special physical constitution. My body heals itself no matter how badly it's injured. Incredible. I can't believe it. Any injury? Yeah. That's why I'm kept here as my master's “human toy.” What do you mean “human toy,” Mai? I mean... Your body heals from any injury? Even if you're dismembered? Yes, it does. But if the damage is really serious, it doesn't heal too quickly. I'm creepy, aren't I? That's why I didn't want you to know. That's not true. You're not creepy. I mean, as I watched you last night... At first I felt so sorry for you as I watched Ms. Kaede hurt you. But that's not all. I also wanted to... - No! - Mai-chan! Wait. Stop, Miyako-chan. Wait. We have to start cleaning or we'll be scolded. Miyako-chan! We can't do this. What are you doing, Miyako-chan? Listen, Miyako-chan, what are you doing? It's okay, isn't it? Okay. When I watch you suffering, Hind you super cute. I just realized it last night. If you regenerate soon, I too want to... Not you too! No! What are you two doing? Aren't you going shopping, Mai? Yes, ma'am! Miyako, come with me. I have something to tell you. Yes, ma'am. It hurts. Wow, it's healed. It hurts. No, Miyako-chan. What is it that I'm feeling? I know. It's the first time someone's told me they loved me. It's delicious, but it hurts my tongue. Miyako. I know what you want to do. The truth is, knowing Mai's special constitution... you want to cut up her body, don't you? You want to know what's inside her body, don't you? You watched me stabbing her eye. You were excited, weren't you? Mai is your senior maid. You want to butcher her inside her body, don't you? Right? Say, “I want to slice Mai into pieces.” I... I... I want to take my senior maid Mai and... butcher her into bloody pieces. I want to torture her cute body. Of course you do. I knew it when we interviewed you. You're a pervert, aren't you? But you still want to, don't you? Yes, I want to. I want to butcher Mai. I want to stab her into pieces. Good girl. Do you want me to grant your wish? What? You can butcher Mai anyway you want. You can cut her apart and tear her into pieces. Mai will heal completely so you can do anything you want. Can you do it? Let's give it a try. Yes. I have to get going. I have to hurry. I'm home. Hello? Nobody's home? MAI, COME TO THE RED ROOM. “Mai, come to the Red Room.” What? The Red Room? What's going on? Miyako appears to be interested in your body. Come on, Miyako, say what you wish. Mai-chan. I want to eat you. What? Wait a moment. Miyako-chan. Miyako, do whatever you want. Wait, Miyako-chan. No, Miyako! “Please eat me, my lady Miyako.” Say it. My lady Miyako, please... Make yourself look more delicious. My lady Miyako, please eat me. You had an accident again. I'm sorry, Ms. Kaede. You have an accident whenever you get scared. I'm sorry. Aren't you ashamed, in front of Miyako? I'm sorry, my lady Miyako. Look at this, Miyako. Ms. Kaede. Her thighs look delicious, don't they? It hurts! Stop! No! It hurts! You're hurting my thigh, Miyako-chan. It hurts! Miyako, her clothes are in the way, aren't they? Ms. Kaede! - This will be better. - No! Go on, Miyako, eat. Use this. You're nothing but trouble. Do it like this. Then, in one breath, cut her straight down. Go on, Miyako. Do as you please. You're so lovely, Mai-chan. What are you doing, Miyako-chan? No! It hurts! No, don't put your hand inside my body. Great. Your innards, Mai-chan. Wonderful. It's nice and warm inside your tummy. Your tummy, Mai-chan. It smells so good. Your innards feel so good. Your innards smell so good, Mai-chan. You're hurting me! So lovely. Incredible. Your innards, Mai-chan. They taste so good. Mai-chan. Let's eat together. You are delicious, Mai-chan. Let's eat together, Mai-chan. You want to enjoy more of what's inside Mai's body, don't you, Miyako? Use this and cut her apart. Go on. How long do I have to hold it for you? Give me your heart, Mai-chan. I can't wait anymore. My master. Did it satisfy you? Yes, she was the right choice. Yes, sir. FINAL CHAPTER ONE WEEK LATER Are you okay, Mai-chan? Yeah, not bad. Are your injuries healing? Yeah, pretty much. I'm glad to hear it. But you're so cute when you're injured. - Am I? - Yes, so cute. Here. Have some water. Thank you. I'm sorry, Miyako-chan. It'll be some time before I'm completely healed. It must be hard doing all the cleaning yourself. No, it's all right. Don't worry. I'll just work hard until you're completely healed. Please make sure to eat your meal today. Yeah. I made rice porridge, so please eat it later. Eat well and get better soon. Thank you, Miyako-chan. You're so kind. You know I love you, Mai-chan. So when you're healed, let's... Miyako-chan? Ouch! It hurts, Miyako-chan. What are you doing, Miyako-chan? At that moment, my heart started beating.
