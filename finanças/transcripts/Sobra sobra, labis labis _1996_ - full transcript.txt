What are you doing Nilo? I fell. Wait. - Just a sec. - Let’s stay here first. - What are you doing? - Let’s stay here for a while. Nilo, stop that... Nilo, stop it. It tickles. Wait. - Let’s start it from here going up! - Stop it. Stop here. We’re on the stairs, we might fall. Come on, be quiet. Wait, we might fall. - I said be quiet. Wait a sec. - What are you doing? There. Alright, be back later okay. Don’t come home late. You know your mom. She’s like a chicken, always talking non-stop. She might scold us again. Okay. I’ll leave you my uniform. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it. Bye! Alright. Freddie? Freddie? Freddie! Freddie! Freddie? Hey! You missed me? Yeah. Your mom and I have been waiting for you. Why did you come late? Why do you care? Carol! Tell your daughter if I give a damn or not. Mom, what is the meaning of this? Andales has a punch, he's got a big punch so watch out for that. Seven knockouts and 17 wins so far. My child, Nilo and I are married. We’re husband and wife now. That’s why you should call him Uncle Nilo. Aren’t you joking? Is that true? Stop asking, Pinay. We’re telling the truth. What you heard is true. That’s why I care for you now. From now on, I’ll be your father and you are my daughter. Daughter? Are you out of your mind! Mom! You didn’t even told me that you’ll be marrying someone. Because you’re all ignoring me. Oh come on Pinay. It happened unexpectedly. It’s already done. Just accept it. Maybe you're not aware, that it was your Uncle Nilo who helped me with your school fees. If it wasn’t for your Uncle Nilo, you probably stopped going to school. Carol, don’t force it on Pinay. I care about those you care about, Carol. See? You heard that? Okay, go change now. I’ll prepare our dinner. I’m tired mom. I just want to rest. - Josephina, wait. - Carol, just let Pinay rest. She’s tired. Come here. - What? - We just got married, focus on me. Wait a sec. What? What is it? Wait. What are you doing? Nilo! Nilo! Nilo! Pinay! Pinay! Pinay. You got a mail. Here. This is from America. So you're getting married with your boyfriend. Amboy, I don’t have a boyfriend in America. Every two weeks you’re getting a mail. From whom? Be careful, I might tell Freddie. Just kidding. It’s like you’re selling me. Aren’t you ashamed? And you're planning to make money out of my wedding. What would others say if they found out about this? Especially Freddie! You knew that Freddie is my boyfriend! So that's it? What are expecting from that farmer? What? Tell me? I love Freddie and you can’t stop us! Josephina! Just relax, your heart. Josephina, my child. What I did is for your sake. For us. Don’t you want to have a great future? Remember this, parents want nothing but the best for their children. And this is the ideal way we've thought of, so we can escape poverty. But mom, I’m about to finish my study. We’ll make it through. I might not be there when that happens. I’m old. Thank you again Myrna. - Why don’t you want to spend the night here? - It’s fine. I don’t want to be the scorer here. Don't bother thanking me. Who else would help us, but each other. Okay, I’ll go ahead now. Just include us, okay? - Oh you! - Hey! Freddie! - Don't get my friend exhausted. - Bye. Yes. You really love me don’t you? Imagine, you sneak out from your mom for me. That's insanely brave. If I will be marrying someone, I might as well marry the one I truly love. Freddie, what do you prefer? Are you a beloved or the one who loves? It depends. If the person loves you, then you should love him in return. It would be awkward, if only one of you loves the other. It should be fair. That’s what good in love. That’s why I sneak out from my mom. And asked you to go away with me. Freddie, I love you so much. I don’t care if I love you more than you love me. It’s you who I want to be my husband. I want to be marry to you and not to someone I barely know. Do you believe me? Of course. I love you too Pinay. Get up! Freddie! Freddie! Pinay! Let go of him! You can get nothing out of that poor guy! Come here! - Come here! - Mom, stop it! You asshole. It's good that we scared Myrna. Shut up! Shut up! Stop it. Stop it Shut up! Shut up! I know who‘s the Chief here, so stop being a stubborn. You're marrying that American, he already sent us money. - Freddie... - And look what you're doing! You stop it! What? What? I’ll do any thing you want, just let him go, I beg you. She already agreed, Nilo. Stop it! Stop. Stop it! Get out. So you'll agree in the end. Take you daugher out. Come now. We will go home. Leave him. Let’s go home. - Come now! - Freddie, forgive me. What ever happens, I love you. - Stop it. - I love you so much, Freddie. - Let's go. - Whatever happens forgive me. Let's go. Captain, I leave him to you now. Let's go to Chief. So, have you learned your lesson now? You loved the wrong girl. You should have not messed with Nilo's niece. Don't you know that he's a thug? He's in good terms with Chief. Don't you know the punishment of kidnapping with rape? That hurt. Pinay is beautiful, so it's fair she marries that American. We should go ahead. Thank you. We will go ahead now. Thank you. - Pray for my future grandchild. - We'll go ahead. - We'll pray for that. - Thank you. Take care. Hey mate. So mate. You're leaving? Yes, we'll go ahead. Thank you mate. Thank you! Thanks to you. Mate! Thank you mate. I'll leave you there. So what now. You're leaving today. Your husband is too eager to leave. Ricky, when do we see our daughter? Why not spend the night here? We want to make you happy, mom. We’d love to spend the night but... We’ve got to fix her travelling papers so we could keep on schedule. I know what you’re thinking. When we get settled in the States, we’ll get you next. I promise. Thank you. And we want you to have this. No Ricky. That’s too much already. You’ve given us enough money. That’s it. Enough. Come on, take it. Consider it as an advance present for you. Just take it. Come on. Okay. Thank you. - Take care of my girl alright? - I promise. Thank you. Alright. We'll leave now. Be safe. Bye Uncle. Bye now. Take care. - Bye. - Bye bye. What? How much did that jerk gave you? What are you Nilo! Remember, I am the mastermind of this plan. I know. You're too loud. Someone might hear you. I'll tell you later. I still need to count it. I just reminded you. You might forget it. Honey, welcome to our honeymoon suite. I made a reservation for this place when I was in the States. This is gonna be our little paradise. While waiting for your papers. What do you think? - Welcome back, congratulations. - Congratulations, sir. Thanks a lot guys. By the way, this is my wife, Mrs. Blackwell. Hello ma'am. Come here. I’ll give you some. - This is for you - Thank you sir. - Here you go Joe. - Thank you sir. - I’ll just call you guys. - Yes sir. Okay Ma'am. That’s for the car rental. Thank you sir. That’s for you, Danny boy. - Thank you sir. - Just be around when I need you. Yes sir. Would you look at that? Those guys are incredible. Isn't this something? Look at that. Rick, Pinay. Those guys are really something. Come on, I’ll show you something over here. Look, it’s almost like LA, isn’t it? Almost like LA. Listen honey. I promise you, when we get to the States, you’ll be happy. I promise you. I’ll do anything to make you happy. I promise. Please stop, you’re hurting me. Stop. Stop. Don’t play games with me! I’m your husband, you’re my wife. I didn't marry for nothing! Where is the promise she made, that she will love no one but me? That she will kill herself if her mother forced her to marry someone. That Pinay is a liar. Right Myrna? Freddie, let's just drink. Right Myrna? Right? Our friend Pinay just fooled us! That's enough, Freddie. What are you! She disappeared just like bubbles. She's like a breeze blowing through the bay. It's already done! There is nothing you can do! Pinay is already married. You have no girlfriend to regret about! I also lost a friend. Earlier, they left after the party, they're heading to Manila. They will stay there, while waiting and processing the papers of Pinay. America? She's only after the money there. She thinks she's the only woman in the world! Will you stop that! If she can replace me, then I can do it too. Right Myrna? Right? Liar! You are a liar! Stop it! What are you doing! Enough. Liar. That's enough. That's enough. - Stop it. - Liar. Stop it. I gave her a shot of tranquilizer. Ang she has to stay here for awhile. It’s a case of vaginal laceration. You know Filipino women are very tight. Mr. Blackbell, you know you have to take it very slow. Nice and easy. Give her some time. She’ll be okay. I’m sure. She’ll be able to handle you perfectly. Thanks doc. I’ll see you. I’m sorry honey. I’m really sorry. You believe me now? It looks good. I told you. It's not only Pinay who can be happy. We are comfortable as well. By the way, where’s the money that Pinay sent us? When are you going to withdraw it? Tomorrow. Are you sure? Yes, tomorrow. Yes. Because I organized a derby on the next day. I just need to treat my friends. Don't spend the money that's for our business! Yes of course. My money is separated from the money for our business. Right? For my friends. Okay fine. You're so nice. Hello, mom? Yes? It’s not working. - She’s not a virgin. - What’s wrong? Oh my god. - She better take care of you! - It's not working. I try! Your dad wants to talk to you, okay? Hello son. Your mom and I are in trouble with the alien police. It got something to do with the insurance claim for your wife. You're not supposed to tell where I am. The insurance people are coming over and asking for you. They suspect that it's murder! Is that true? Yeah, yeah I know listen. Let the lawyers take care of it, okay? Okay. And dad listen. What ever you do, don’t call me here. I’ll be the one to call you there, okay? Okay. Take care. You guys too. Bye bye. You play games with me. Stop it. Round and round you go. Please. Hey Lita! Hey Dan! How are you? I'm okay. What do you do now? I'm kinda busy this week. Can you share some? My work is not doing good. That's not a problem. I got plenty of it. So might as well put it aside. Are these all mine? Yes. What's the catch? Go in. It’s like you’re selling me. Aren’t you ashamed? And you're planning to make money out of my wedding. What would others say if they find out about this! Especially Freddie! Josephine? I’m sorry. Listen babe. You gotta understand. You’re my wife. That’s why I married you. You understand what I’m saying? Look if it’s the money I gave your mother, Don’t worry about it. It’s really you that I wanted. I’ll be nice. I promise. Look, just forgive me, will you please? Excuse me sir. You’re not touching your food, why won't you eat something? Look, I didn’t bring you here to waste my hard earned money, you got that? You can eat your money! Nilo? Where is the ten thousand that I gave you? What ten thousand are you asking for, Carol? Don't look for it. Don't you know that we lost? And yet you kept asking for something that is gone. I haven't even invested in it yet. But still you kept asking for it. What? You're unbelievable Nilo. What chicken do I put in the cage that I asked Freddie to make? You're really stupid. You're so narrow minded. What is your daughter Pinay doing? It's Pinay again? You always ask for Pinay's help. She already gave us so much. Pinay doesn't own the money. The american guy owns it. Then ask from your imported son-in-law. Stop being annoying. I'm having a bad luck here, and yet here you are to annoy me even more. You really want to get kicked? You kept asking. Your mother said you’ll gonna be alright after this. I don't know what your problem is! I though you’ll be fine, but you screwed things up! This is bullshit. You are nothing but a stupid bitch. I’m not a bitch. My mother forced me to marry you. Do I have a choice? Bald! So that’s the way it is. Don’t you frickin move. Wait right here. I’m coming back. Hi, good evening, sir. Are you Mr. Blackwell? That’s right. Is there any problem? Oh there’s no problem really. I just picked this up at the restaurant downstairs. And I saw your identification card. And I think this belongs to you. Yes. This certainly looks like my wallet. Thank you officer. So how’s your wife doing? My wife? She’s sleeping. So what happened to your face? Is there anything wrong? My face? A local cat got in, we were playing around. It's just a cat. Okay, we won't bother you anymore. Have a good evening. Thank you. We’ll go ahead. Good evening gentlemen. Let's go. I hope your dreams come true. I know you're just being forced by your greedy mother and Uncle Nilo. i just hope that guy won't hurt you. Because no matter where he goes, I will kill him. It's because I wanted to make a complaint. I've been here in this apartelle for a long time. Yes. There's a new tenant on the upper level and I don't know what they are doing there. We are being distured. They're right there throwing stuffs. - My son and I couldn't sleep. - Good morning sir. - What's seems to be the problem here? - It's too much. - Sir, she's complaining. - Well, I don't like that. - It's annoying. - Ma'am. - What happened? - You know sir... I'm just worried, about what's happening there. There's crying, throwing, I even hear the woman crying for help! I get nervous. Can you go and check upstairs? They're there, sir. You can ask them. Where is Mr. De Guzman? The manager is on leave. He'll be back maybe two days from now. - Is that right? - So what now Sir? We can’t do anything for now, Ma’am. We can’t just go in there because it’s invasion of privacy. But no worries, since it’s my jurisdiction if that ever happens again, just let Mr. Erwin, or Mr. De Guzman know and we’ll fix it. I hope you can do something about it immediately. Barquillas. Sir. Get her statement. Yes Sir. Ma’am Carol? Where’s Ma’am Carol? She’s not here yet. You could just wait here. She’s about to arrive. Have you received a letter from Pinay? I’m not quite sure. You could just ask her mother instead. Finally, you’re here. Come, let’s drink first. Let’s finish this while waiting. Go ahead, seat there. Drink on your own. How’s life? It’s okay. I already miss my bestfriend. You knew that we’ve been together since we were a child. Well, that’s life. People are not getting younger as time flies. Well you should plan your future while you’re still young. That is how marriage is. When you're married, you won’t bother to visit anymore because you’ll be busy with your wife. Drink more. Drink. Okay. Okay. Go ahead drink. By the way Myrna. Change topic. Let’s talk about you. Don’t you have plans to have a taste of God’s creation, just like your friend? Come on. You’re drunk again. I’m not drunk Myrna. I'm just sober. I’m being serious. Drink. Drink more. We have plenty of that. Here's more. Cardo, make it sturdy, okay? Yes, Ma’am Carol. Freddie, thank god you accepted to manage our poultry. Since your family and I are friends, right? And besides, my daughter Pinay is your friend as well. Ma’am Carol, we used to be a couple. Freddie. It’s delicious! Myrna, don’t you notice something in yourself? What is it? Look at you. How can someone like you? You dress like a man. You see, you even wear a cap. Will you remove that? - Stop it Mr. Nilo. - See, you look pretty without the cap. Your beauty really stands out. Freddie, please forgive us. If we have wronged you. By the way, about the news that’s spreading, that we are earning money from Pinay being married to that American guy. Yes, that is actually right. We earned five thousand dollars. That is actually the money that we used to buy this farm. And besides, I’m pretty sure you can understand us, right? We both can’t do anything about it now. We can’t take it back. Josephine is already married. My dearest Pinay. That’s true. Okay, I still need to go the the market. I have to cook for Nilo. Take care of Nilo's roosters, okay? Thank you. Nilo? Nilo? Have pity on me! Hey come in, man! Glad to see you, man. We did it. I don’t know how they knew. God! Hey! Cool out, man. We’ll be ready for it. How pitiful. Come on, help me. Hurry up! Help him. Faster! Faster! Hold her. Hold her. Nick, hurry up! Yeah yeah, I'm done. You ain't going no where. Got everything squared away? Listen honey, I gotta go now. You be a real good girl. Come on, let’s get out of here. Will you please call Mr. Blackwell? I’ve been waiting for an hour now. My trunkline is busy and so is his. You should probably go up there. Okay, I’ll go up. Alright. I’ll go up. - Just go up there. - Okay. Mr. Blackwell? Mr. Blackwell? Mr. Blackwell? Mr. Blackwell? Sir? Sir? Mr. Blackwell? Mr. Blackwell? Ma’am! Help me! My husband will kill me. Hurry! Where the hell do you think you’re going?! Well, well... A while ago you said your name is Manolo. What is the truth? It’s Manolo Sir. He said Manolo. Sir, I found the man you’re looking for. Yes Sir. Alfredo. That’s all Sir. What? Why? I thought so. Men! Let’s move! Danny! I’ve been good to you man. I’ve been good to you and what do you do? You steal from me, man. You steal my wife! I bought her. She’s mine! She’s mine! Got that?! She’s mine! You’re trespassing. God damn it! Do it man! Do it man! Come on! Get up. Get up. Come on! Cruz, position yourselves here. Larry, Tagle. You go stay in the fire escape. Yes Sir. Here! Come on! Jim! Damn it! Drop the gun! Drop the gun or I’ll blow her brain out! Drop it! Drop it! You may now kiss the bride. Are you sure about what you are doing? Yes. Here, you need to drink this three times a day. Okay. Is that clear? Yes. I already instructed her what needs to be done. She needs to rest. Thank you. Hey? Are you doing fine? Do you feel better? Who’s the next patient? Come. Go inside. Who’s the patient? It's her. Come. You stay outside. Don’t get nervous. You can do it. That’s enough. Come now. Don’t worry Miss, she’s a good doctor. You know I like the alias of our patient. Ligaya Paraiso. What a nice alias. Ligaya Paraiso. Are you a woman? Are you stupid? Are you stupid? Hey Tisay! What am I suppose to feed you and that child? What do I care? Lord, please forgive my friend. She’s so dumb. There are a lot of guys out there. There are plenty of them, why him? He’s probably good in bed? No, I shouldn't think that! Remember this, Tisay. I’ll only accept you if you have that child aborted. Remember that! Please don't allow her to have Raspa often. Because her womb might not be able to withstand it. This idiot may never bear a child. Lord, please take care of her. Drink your milk. I don’t want it anymore. How will you be able to gain your strength back? You knew that my earnings is not enough for the two of us. I have a lot of things to pay everyday. By the way, the writer who wants to interview you just called. The 2500 honorarium that will be given to you will go to waste. You need money, right? We need to buy antibiotics for you. Okay, we’ll meet him. When is that again? In two days time. So that’s why you need to get well soon. Don’t worry, Tisay. Since I have a job now, we’ll just share on that. That's my friend! Really? Hey pal, this is Dean. We are doing the stag party tomorrow. See you. Hey. Mommy is asking. Call her number ASAP, okay? Hello? Roy, this is Leni. Anyway, we are doing the interview two days from now. Don’t worry, Tisay will be there. I’ll take care of it. Just make sure you’ll give her the 2500 honorarium. She’s broke. That’s the only reason why she said yes. Okay, bye. Wait, that's 11 PM, okay? Tisay. Good thing you came. I thought you’re going to ditch me. You know the reason why I’m here right. Come. Let’s start. - This interview is quite long. - Let's start, so I can already go home. My boyfriend Jackie might arrive. It’s a miracle, you’re in a hurry this time. You think you can get something good in interviewing me? Why are we wasting our time if we can’t get anything good out of this? What I mean is, will you be able to find something interesting from our story? Is there anything else left that’s not been told about sluts? About whores? That’s what I want to know. I hope you can give me the answer. What do you think? I don’t know. You’re the writer, right? Hey! You slut! You are shameless! You knew that Jackie is my boyfriend. You are stealing someone else's boyfriend. Hey! Have a bit of shame, Tisay. Your recruiter should be called a slut instead. Put him on a leash, just like a dog. You are in a wrong position to get jealous. Which make you look like a bitch even more. Out of the way. Move. Move. You animal! That’s enough! Hey! You’re shameless! Will you stop that! Tisay, are you okay? I’m okay. I just remembered something. I hope my guts are correct. That you possess the key to sucess that I’ve been looking for a long time. And you even said that you'll tell the truth that will put to an end to so many wrong beliefs. You're shameless! You are such a bitch! You’re really good at it. You're really good on stealing other's boyfriends! Why Tisay? Don’t tell me that until now you haven’t accepted the fact that you’re not the only woman he's sharing the bed with? Why not? If there are so many queens, then there are so many kings out there as well. But I think you’ve forgotten that the bed you’re using is mine. That’s why I will teach you how to pay! Hey! You slut! Come here! Come! Come! - Shameless bitch! - Enough. You animal! - Let go of me! - You! You! I’ve been waiting for your arrival! Because I’m ready to dump you! Brenda's the queen now! Because she provides me anything I want! And she’s better in bed than you! Get out of here! Get out! Let’s see what will you become! You think you can still find some guy like me! You are shameless, Jackie! - I did everything you want! - What is that? And this is how you repay me! It's Jackie again. You are all shameless! Tisay, that’s enough. - I hope you die soon! - Tisay! Stop it. Come. Tisay stop now. Get a glass of water please. Give her water quick. Stop now. Stop. Stop now. Stop. I don’t care. They're the ones with the problem! Such hyprocrites! But aren’t we all just the same? With shower or none. There are so many names to describe them. A lot of names. But they all mean the same. Pokpok in Tagalog, Jokard in slang term, and Pampam in Cebuano. In Batanguenio, it's Pabefer. Which means, pay before you enter. And in english, prostitute. Hey Tisay! Why are you here? Give me that. How are you? I’m good. You have a bag there. Let me guess, you have a problem right? No. Your house looks different. It’s weird. Just like the two of us. Is this how writers usually are? Okay. You see I can only answer for myself. But you can stay here for as long as you want. And if you feel sleepy, you can use the sleeping bag. This is a bachelor’s pad that’s why I don’t do formality. And if you feel hungry, you can just look in the refrigerator. Maybe you'll get full. Okay? Okay. By the way, these are my pets. This is Benito, this is Joe. Benito. Joe. This is Tisay. They’re cute. Good thing they don’t look like you. They will, soon. Let’s go. - Give me those two. - How much is this? Later. Oh gosh. This is crazy. Here, eat. Hey! So, what’s up? Mommy dearest, what exactly did the both of you saw, you and Tisay to Jackie? When he was still a newbie here, I already rejected him. And to think that I like mestizo guys. Ask him. Well, that’s why. You don’t know what you’re missing. His dick is huge. It can be used for fencing with the three musketeers. Oh really? Wow! Only if I knew. By the way, going back to our last will and testament... Where are we again? Don’t play with me! And tell Tisay, I don’t like getting fights with her. Truth is, I didn’t actually steal Jackie from her. That asshole told me, it’s been a month since their break up. How should I know if he was lying? Customers. Come, this is money! Oh there they are. I’ll have the younger one, you take the other one. Hello boys. Hi. Looking for a good time? Yes. How much should I pay? Not too expensive. This is a holdup! Remove all the jewelries. Hurry! Will you hurry! What are you waiting for! Give me that! Go down! Quickly! You Leni, you always get me in trouble. You don’t choose your customer. You see, those guys are robbers. Do I know that?! They even took my fake earrings. Good for you, it was fake! What they took from me are all real, and I worked hard to buy those. All of it are real! Okay! Let’s not argue. Where are we? Seems like we’re in... Let’s go find a cab to ride. Tisay, what were you saying a while ago? You’re so annoying, Roy. A woman who can easily be fooled is called a mistress. If they ask for payment? Whore! And if they do it for free? A wife? A sauce. Very beautiful. Thank you. Twinkle! Who is that? Excuse me. That's Twinkle, she is the one who's giving us customers whenever Leni is not around. Hello! Why are you late? I've been trying to contact you. Who is that with you? Oh yeah. This is Tis, he's Arabic who likes orgies. He has a huge dong. He likes gorgeous women. And are you okay with those other two who's wearing suits? You go there also okay? This is Roy, by the way. He's a friend. - Oh hello Roy. - She's Carmina, and this is Twinkle. Let’s go. Excuse us. Roy, let's just meet tonight. Okay. This is Tisay, the one I’m telling you a while ago. Hello. See. - Get ready, he's got a big dong. - Really? Yes. Well? Tisay, come. Drink coffee first. Tisay, aren't you really afraid of your job or get disgusted? I'm used to it. If you encounter a crazy customer, you should toughen up even if your knees are shaking. If you found a nice customer, a bit of drama, and you'll get payment immediately. Why don’t you look for a more decent job? Are you kidding? Aren't we all like that in life? We use others for our own sake. You should know that because you're a writer. You're not blind nor deaf. It's easy to say to change. But we'll get there. But when? By the time that you're old and your body is wrinkled? And there is no more customers left to pay you? That's a long way off. What's important is now. Tomorrow has no guarantee. You, you're a writer now. Maybe tomorrow, you might become a thief. Bitch of men. Are you really that desperate? This is how true it is. It's easier to see what's near you than the future. Is that right Roy? Oh it's already noon. I'm late again. I've been trying to wake you up. I'm sorry. I don't know how to cook. Make the best out of this sardines. It's okay, I'm used to this. Hurry up and you might miss your appointment. The secretary of Ms. Ibañez called twice. Alright. I'll go ahead. Ligaya Paraiso, the town's wife is also the writer's wife. Roy, Ligaya Paraiso is not a love story that you want me to believe. In fact, it is a love triangle that involves you as the third party. So you mean my characters are not enough? What I meant is you should show you heart. The colorful relationship of a writer and his inspiration. Write here, Tisay alias Ligaya Paraiso. I want to see you again. Call me when this novel is finished, Okay? Alright. See you. Jackie? That's why you didn't come home anymore. It's like a forest, it's so messy. Who is your new found Tarzan? Don't tell me you're jealous? He's a writer. It's Roy. He said he's going to make a movie about my life. I'm just on a vacation here. Just letting go of the grudges. On vacation, or you already live here? It's none of your business! Did you even care when you left me when I was pregnant? After you pushed me away! Shame on you to show up again! You're a fool! You wanted to get pregnant in a wrong time. What will I feed you and that child! Why did you look for me! What do you even care now? I got lucky that someone sympathizes me. I just heard you had an abortion, but it's too late. You obeyed me so it means you still love me. Don't you? What about Brenda? Brenda and I are done. I pushed her away. You know you're the only one that I love, right? - You're just fooling me. - Right? What are you doing? Jackie. Here Sir. Thank you. Jackie. And you're bringing customers here in my house now? Tisay, this is not a motel. Don't make this an immoral place. Sorry Roy. This is Jackie. My boyfriend. The one I'm telling you. What? Didn't you hear? I’m Jackie. Her boyfriend. Do you have problem with that? - Are you crazy? - Don't, Jackie! This is my house. You were Tisay’s boyfriend. But that was before. You asshole! Jackie! Stop fighting! Jackie! Roy! You need to stop! Jackie! That’s enough! Jackie don’t! Let’s go. Damn you! Jackie stop it! Jackie stop! That’s enough! Damn you! I don’t know if I should be grateful to you. How much did you earn from Tisay’s story?! I will now claim what is mine. Let’s go Tisay. Roy sorry. Ma'am, he's the one who doesn't want to pay. Sir, we're already closing. It's already 4:30 AM. Here's your bill. How much is that? It's 465 pesos. Here. Sorry Sir. Just go back next time. I'll just finish my beer. Okay. I don't care! It’s them who have a bigger problem. That's him, the one I'm telling you. The son of a rich Congressman. He used to be your customer. But we only talked for a short time so stop talking too much. Are you seeing a girl? There you are again. Oh Jackie. Boss. Is that her? It's her. Get inside. Thank you! Is she good? Yes boss. You sure about that. Here's more. Okay. - Okay. - Thank you. Are you saying that you have no intention of accomplishing the wonderful story of Ligaya Paraiso? Why would I? The main character is gone. Maybe it's your chance now, to show the difference between you and Jackie. Or the similarity of the writer and the pimp. There's a big difference. A lot of differences. Really? Is there is? Whatever it is, it's still zero! Maybe your dicks just taste and smell alike? Come here! You're pregnant, right? What? Pregnant? Are you pregnant? No Jackie. No. You're pregnant! I'm not! Don't fool me. I wasn't born yesterday! Who are you proud of? Your writer boyfriend? I already gave you a chance, I almost died. It's my turn now. I will give birth to this baby, whether you like it or not! And what if I kill you? Haven't you learned your lesson yet? I will kill you! You animal! Roy. This is Tisay. Come see me at our meeting place. Why Tisay? What's the problem? I'll tell you here. Please hurry. Alright. Don't leave there. Just wait for me. I'll be there. Don't worry. I know a lawyer. He'll help you. Thanks a lot, Roy. But there is another problem. What is it? I'm pregnant. Who's the father? I'm not sure. Here. Hurry up and clean. Clean it very well. Hey you! Do it faster. Hey, fix that! Tisay. Why? What happened? Quickly! Tisay is about to give birth! Is she giving birth? Let's help her! It's coming out! Push harder! Go! We're almost there! Just a bit more! Push a bit more! You're almost there Tisay! That's right! Push! You can do it! It’s there! It’s there! Just a bit more! Push a bit more! It’s almost there! There! There! There! Oh gosh! The baby is a girl! Oh god! She’s so pretty! She’s so pretty! Her skin is so white! She look just like you! She’s so pretty!
