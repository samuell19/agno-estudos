It may seem like a cold town But, man, let me tell ya, it's a soul town ( hip-hop music plays ) Go, go, go Go, go, go Go, go, go Go, go, go It may seem like a cold town Go, go, go But, man, let me tell ya, it's a soul town Go, go, go... ( police radio on ) What are you doing? What do you mean? Aren't you going in? I thought you were. I went in yesterday, Jerry. Would you mind, Ray? 'Cause my knee's killing me. Your knee? What about my back? - Anybody care about that? - I'm sorry. I care. I'll just take a Double Bun Burger! Have a Burger Bun day. - Hey, how you doin'? - Two Double Bun burgers - and a chocolate shake, please. - Is that it? No, I'll take an order of fried nose rings too. - What? - I'm kidding. It's a joke. Knock yourself out, dude. Knock myself out? - What does that mean? - ( woman screams ) Woman: Oh my God! Man: Born and raised in Brooklyn. 36 years. Went to P.S. 115. Mom and Dad wanted me to go to Catholic school. My best friend John... man, he was cool. Wish he could see me now. - Do I have your attention now? - Yes, sir. Then look at me when I talk to you! I'm trying, but it's difficult... - with my back-- - Fuck your back! I got the mayor, the commissioner, the C. of D. up my ass because you were standing right there with your weapon out, and you couldn't stop one guy from killing six people! I know, sir, I should have dropped the guy. Nobody feels worse about this than I do. Any thoughts on that comment, Dimitri? With all due respect, Lieutenant... I imagine the relatives of the victims might feel worse than Detective Pluto. Lieutenant: They just might. - Any questions for him? - Dimitri: No, it's pretty clear. - Questions about what? - Your cases. - I've reassigned them to Dimitri. - Why? Because you're a goddamn cripple! - I'm fine. - Stand up! You're on restricted duty until I get confirmation from the chief surgeon that your back's 100%. Now get out! Dimitri, get this faggot a wheelchair. - Hey, Ray. - Where have you been? - I went to get the paper. - What about your knee? I took it real slow. It was over when I got back. - What did Spigot say? - I'm on restricted duty - till I get this back fixed. - And me? I told him you were getting gas. Thanks. Oh shit! I'm sorry. Listen, I owe you. Anything you want, just name it. - How about a new back? - All right. Why don't you go see a chiropractor? I need a real doctor, not some frou-frou shit like that. Jerry: What are you talking about? Wait. Listen to me. When my back went out, I couldn't get off the floor. I had to crawl to the bathroom on my hands and knees. My brother-in-law turned me on to this chiropractor, and... it's incredible. It's crazy shit, but it works. - They do this adjustment-- - Pluto. Here's your gun. It was tough getting it back from that kid. He was afraid you wouldn't know what to do with it. - I could stick it up your ass. - You could... but there's no bad guys up there. What, no room with Spigot's dick up there? Reporter: Detective Pluto, Channel 10 News. Do you feel responsible for the death of those people? Do you feel responsible for the death of your wife and daughter? How does it feel being upstaged by an eight-year-old? Man: Look at this shit! - Mira, Maribel! - Maribel: What? Don't tell me your friend didn't do this. - He didn't do it. - Then who?! I don't see everybody who comes in this building. - So it was your friend! - It was not! Would you two shut up? I'm trying to watch the TV! Tell him to leave me alone! TV announcer: Here's Bill with the latest on this afternoon's Burger blood-bath. A brave eight-year-old boy is now a national hero for shooting a gunman who slaughtered six people in a crowded Brooklyn Burger Bun this afternoon. Ricky Lapinsky... Man: Come here! That says "Lucy," right? Lucy! It does not say "Lucy"! - You can't even read! - Ray, Ray... got a minute? What does that say? I don't know, Juan, it's all Chinese to me. Ah-ha! So it's your Chink friend, then! You're so stupid! Do you hear what she calls me?! All right... - forget the tattoo! - See you later, Juan. Take care. You said I could. When you learn to respect your father and speak to your father, then maybe I'll let you look like a whore! Mommy, he said I could get a tattoo, and I'm getting it! - Yes, I am! - No, you're not! If you don't shut up, I'll go crazy! I've been working all day and I want to watch TV, cono! Earlier today, Mayor Geminelli praised Ricky as one of New York's finest. Geminelli: This boy is a hero. And if I had 20 more like him, I could wipe out crime in this city. TV announcer #1: The mayor had less flattering remarks for New York City Detective Raymond Pluto who was in the restaurant ordering lunch at the time of the massacre. Although armed and standing merely 10 feet away, Detective Pluto apparently was unable to stop the slaughter because of a bad back. Ray: What if I hadn't been in the place? Did they think about that? Then the kid wouldn't have had the gun to shoot the guy. Hey, everybody, welcome to Fitness Cheers! We've got a really tough workout coming up... ( phone rings ) - Yeah? - Man: Detective Pluto? I'm calling from "The New York Post." - I need to verify some facts. - What facts? Are you Detective Pluto whose wife and daughter were killed in a hit-and-run accident two years ago? I'll tell ya... All right, guys, let's stretch out. Let's go down for four. And two... ( phone rings ) You motherfucking cocksucking fucking piece of shit! - Fucking press cockroach! - Ray? It's me, Jerry. Hey. Aw, man... - I'm sorry, Jerry. - Jerry: You all right? - You sound really upset. - I thought you were this scumbag reporter who's been calling. I'm sorry. How are you doing? Just checking up on you. What are you doing? I was sitting around, smoking some hash. Yeah, me too! I just did a whole bucket of crack! You're too much, man. I got the number for that chiropractor. Oh great. Go ahead You're ready? Dr. Beamer. 555-0191. All right. Good, man. - I appreciate it. - So... how are you feeling mentally? I'm doing good, man. You know? - Thinking about a few things. - Care to talk about it? Sure. Umm... Did you ever notice... women sometimes call each other "guys"? They'll say, "Let's go, guys," and it's all girls there. Yeah, I've seen them do that. Guys don't do that. You never hear guys go, "Let's go, girls." What, guys calling other guys "girls"? Ray: Yeah... - it'd be an insult. - Like calling them a fag. Exactly. But it's okay for women to say, "Hey, let's go, guys." It's fucking crazy. Ray: You know? - Yeah? - All right... thanks for calling. - I'll see you tomorrow. - All right. ( world trance music playing ) It's killer. It'll blast you like a Sandinistan guerilla. Killer. You don't know the diller. Everybody knows that I'm a killer. - Man: Who is it? - Cletis. Man: About time. - Maribel: I hate you! - No, you don't! You love me! I'm your papi! - Maribel: I hate you! - No, you don't mean that! - What you looking at? - What the fuck you looking at? You do that graffiti? Cletis, come on! We got work to do. Pendejo, cono. All right. We got the guy already tied up in the chair. We got the Chinese food already delivered. Then you signal me, just with your eye. Yeah. Then I take out a chopstick... Iike this. Put it in the guy's ear. Then I take off my shoe. - What do you think? - It's too quick. We want to inflict pain, right? Long, slow... painful pain. He's sitting in the chair... all immobilized and shit. Now, that would hurt. - Cletis: You see that? - Mmm-hmm. - Man: Good shot! - A dart in the eyeball. That is pain. And I got four more left. Maybe I should throw a couple. - You? - Just... one or two. - You're saying you like this? - Oh, man! Come on! We're totally using that! I told you. You are a great writer. Let's get this shit down. Scene 29: interior, - warehouse - day. - Dictate this for me, Duke. I want to do the darts going in with a giant close-up. We need the right sound. I want a solid "thwock!" when it sticks in the dude's head. Write that down. T-H-W-O-C-K. Thwock. Cute little guy. He's getting that award from Geminelli today. Nothing for that cop, though. I feel kind of sorry for him. Oh come on. The putz was there. He had his gun out and he couldn't do it. It's called "performance anxiety." He just couldn't get it up. Detective Pluto? This way. I think that was the guy. How long has your back been bothering you? - About three years. - You've never seen a chiropractor? - No. - Why not? I usually go to regular doctors. I've been looking at your X-rays, sent by your regular doctor and I think I've seen the problem-- in your lower back, here. Can I say something for a second? Do you know chiropractic medicine has been recognized by medical associations since 1963? - No, I didn't know that. - Well, it has. Okay? Right. Take a look at this. See? Look at your lower spine. Now... Iook at this. What do you see? Doctor: The skeleton's spine is curved... whereas yours is straight. No curve, no flexibility. No flexibility, no strength. Your muscles around the vertebrae must work overtime just to hold your spine in place. Finally, they spasm and your back goes out. Could you slip your jacket off and lie down on the table? Ray: Okay. - Can you take your gun off? - Oh... yeah. Give it to me. You'll be head up this end. Face through the gap. Do you have some kind of pillow I could-- No, just relax your head. - Okay. - Relax. Ray: Oh yeah... Oh yeah. I got it. - Your L-5s are all jammed up. - The L-5? Yeah. Okay. I'll release that. Now, just relax. It looks more frightening than it is. Just relax. It'll help release your muscles. Much better. Turn over, please. Don't cross your feet. Okay, now... - Just relax. - Mmm-hmm. I'll give you some exercises to do every day in addition to the adjustments. - Adjustments? - ( pop ) How long have you been on the police force? I don't know. Probably about-- - ( pop ) - Well done! Unbelievable. It takes most people weeks to get that kind of release. Relax. I'll do one more thing, and then you're through. I want to pop your fifth dorsal vertebra. - Where is that? - In the back of your spine. - Take a deep breath in. - Okay. And let it go. Didn't get it. Let's try again. Deep breath in. Now breathe out. You're holding back on me, Detective. Sorry. Maybe you want to try it again? I think we've done enough for today. Girl: All right. I got a tattoo. - No, you didn't! - Girl: I did! Girl #2: Let's see it then. That shit looks nice, Lucy. Yeah, this bug's mad cute! I'll look hot in my bikini this summer, right? - No doubt. We're buggin'. - I get mine, - we'll be the Buggin' Crew. - Lucy: Oh yeah... - the Three Lady Bugs. - I'm getting one too. - All in red. - You dreamin', girl. You ain't gonna get a tattoo. Lucy: Her father would kill her. Maybe you should get... one of those stick-ons. The shit that washes off. Girl #2: Let's go to my house. It's free. I need cigarettes. What's up, little one? I wanna do it. Hey, Ping Pong... she wants to do it. Let's do it. - Where did you get the money? - I found his Christmas tips from all the tenants. He's saving it for our trip to Disneyworld. He made $2,000 just from tips. Shit, I should be a super. - I want a third up front. - How much is that? Ping Pong, what's a third of 2,000? - A half would be 1,000. - I know what a half is. What the fuck is a third of 2,000?! It's 300. I want $300, then we do it. Okay. - Man: You like it? - Where did you get it? Mr. Magic's, down in the Village. What street? - Avenue C. Why? - I might get one. Maribel: How much does it cost? Man: $45. - Does it hurt bad? - No, it doesn't hurt bad. If you want, I can go with you and make sure they do it okay-- You want a tattoo? I'll give you one for free. Let me see them come back here and do this shit again, I'll kick their ass. - Shit. - Hey, Juan, que pasa? Just working, my friend. Fucking graffiti's like a fungus. You don't take care of it right away, it'll spread all over. Well... - you're taking care of it. - I know who's doing it. Those little shit friends of Maribel's. I'll catch them one day and kick them right up the ass. - How's your back? - I'm seeing this chiropractor. Ray, that shit don't work. You gotta relax. I go fishing. - That's how I relax. - Out in the ocean? Are you fucking crazy? Right there. 79th Street, on the Hudson. Good fishing there. Come out with me one day. You'll like it. - I don't know. - I got a rod. I bought a rod for Maribel, she don't use it. Knock on my door, we'll go fishing, - that'll straighten you out. - Maybe I'll do that. - Let's do that. - Okay. - Thanks, Juan. - Okay. Take care of that back. Duke: Coming. Your order. Yo, I caught you on the tube. I didn't know you were a cop. I'm Duke. This is Cletis. How you doing? Ray Pluto. What's with the suits? Going to a costume party? - No, this is how we dress. - The '70s are back. You should check it out. - Okay. Duke: Let me ask you something. You've seen a lot of crazy shit as a cop, right? - People shot, stabbed... - I guess so. Ever seen a guy with darts stuck in him? - Throwing darts? - Cletis: Yes. Perforating him in the head, the eyeballs and the chin. Have you ever seen anything like that? I don't think so. You've never seen it in a movie either, have you? No, I-- no. All right. ( hip-hop music plays ) Go, go, go Go, go, go It may seem like a cold town Go, go, go I'll tell you, Lieutenant, I've been doing these exercises every day, and my back has never felt better. "Det. Pluto has made tremendous progress this past week..." "In his doctor's opinion, Det. Pluto is fit for active duty." This is from a damn chiropractor. Yes, sir. And I don't know if you know, but chiropractic medicine has been recognized by medical associations - since 1962. - Recognize this. If I hear your fucking back goes out again, I'll put you behind a desk out on Staten Island. - How's your dictation? - Not as good as Dimitri's. What did you say? With all disrespect-- with no due respect, I don't know anything about dictation. I'd probably be terrible at it. Get out before I stick my foot up your ass. Okay. Thank you, sir. Great to be back. - You guys have seen Cubbins? - He's right behind you, Sherlock. What are you doing sneaking up on me like that? - How did it go? - Back on duty. I'll treat you to lunch. Look at them. Must be nice, huh, Chick? Sitting around, jerking off all day. Don't worry about me. I got all my cases cleared, plus the two of yours they dumped on me when your partner went on restricted duty. You must want that Detective First Grade pretty bad. - No more than anyone else. - Hey, Pluto. - They're talking about you. - ( TV show music plays ) Tell, me, Ricky, are you angry with the policeman? No, 'cause he probably feels bad he couldn't save the people. TV host: Why couldn't he save the people? Ricky: Maybe he didn't know what to do. But maybe now, after seeing what I did, - he knows what to do next time. - ( audience laughs ) - Do you think he does? - I hope he does, so another kid doesn't have to shoot a man. Let's go. We need a title that smokes. - Something that's in your face. - Right! - "Suck the Monkey"! - Cletis, I love you, man, but we tag this movie, "Suck the Monkey," we lose out on our entire middle audience. That's a lot of box office. - This shit is pissing me off! - I know, man... I know-- wait a second. We said we wanted something in your face. - Right. - There it is. "In Yo Face." - "In Yo Face"? - It's Ebonics! "In Yo Face." And it's perfect now that we're making the Uzi twins black! Whoa. Stop. Decelerate. - When did we decide that? - I thought we said that. - I never said that. - I thought it'd be cool - if they was Black. - Cool?! Duke, I told you I am not into cool. I am into reality. And in reality, a brother would not act that way. Scene 32. "The Uzi twins shoot a cop, - then run off into the night." - Right. That's bullshit! There's no way a brother will run off all mortified! - He'll be like this-- "Pow!" - Uh-huh. He'll turn... and walk off like this. Cool and slow. Oh no, man, they would run, bro'! Fine! Fine! Fine! They run. But then we make them white. You sayin' a white guy will act like that? You tell me a Black guy'll act like that? Come on, man! Cletis, you're my friend! I don't want to be arguing with you. Yeah, you're my friend. But I think you got a bit of racist in you. Whoa. Yo, bro'? - No. - Yes. I noticed it. Is it what I said about the Ebonics? No, it's not that. It's other things. But I don't take it personal, because you're white and you don't know any better. That's some mega-heavy shit, Cletis. I know. Okay... what if... we made the Uzi twins... Puerto Rican? What do you think? - All right? Bro'? - Bro'. You wanna open up to me, - you just go ahead. - Okay, I will. 'Cause I think you keep a lot of stuff inside. This whole Burger Bun thing. And that shit with Dimitri-- even Shelley's accident. You gotta let some of that stuff out. I absolutely agree with you 100%. - I'm sorry. - Yeah? But you never open up with me. I mean... I'm going through some heavy shit right now too, and I don't know if I can talk to you about it. That's not true. Come on. You know that's not true. What is it? I was walking behind you the other day in the precinct... and I realized that I was thinking... "Hey, Ray's got kind of a nice ass!" What did you say? See, I told you it was heavy! You know... I'm not gay, okay? - I'm not! - Of course. Everybody knows that. Then why am I looking at your ass? I don't know. It happens to everybody, I think. Have you ever looked at a guy's ass? I probably have... once or twice. - Have you ever looked at my ass? - No. Why not? I think you gotta talk to somebody about this. I'm talking to you. I mean a professional. - A shrink? - Yeah. To get it off your chest. If you talk to a lot of shrinks, they'll tell you that deep down inside, - everybody's gay. - I'm not fucking gay! I told you, I'm not! - I didn't-- - Why do I even-- All I'm trying to say to you is, you're my friend, okay? And that's all that matters. Okay, cowboy? Here's what we'll do. Drop me off up here. I'll go to my appointment and I'll hook up with you later and we'll figure this thing out. - It's probably just a phase. - Okay. Maybe it was just an accident. Your eyes happened to look there. - You think so? - Could be. You'll be fine. All right? Jerry: All right. Much better. Still doing the exercises? Ray: Every day. How's the pelvic area? Any tension? Roll over. So... where are you from, if you don't mind me asking? And if I do? I was wondering because of your accent. Brighton. On the English Channel. How long have you been over here? - Six years. - Married? Once. - You? - Same. Thanks for getting that recommendation out so quickly, Doc. You got it off fast, and I'm back on duty. You have an excellent recovery. I'm impressed by your discipline. Chiropractic is a lifetime commitment. Really? I didn't know that. I'll have another go at your fifth dorsal vertebra. Take a deep breath. Hold it and... Damn it. I'll get this bastard. Take a deep breath in. - ( pop ) - Oh... yeah. I got it. Yeah. No, wait just a goddamn minute! - Sorry, Dr. Beamer. - Stop calling me that! My name's Ann! And I like you, Detective. But if you think I'll screw you on this table! Of course not, Dr-- Ann! - I have no excuse. I'm sorry. - Stop apologizing! Did you hear me scream for help? I've got three patients waiting outside. Maybe I should just get out of here. I don't know what I was thinking. - Wait a second. - What? - How do I look? - Not good. - Did you want maybe-- - Sure. What? I thought you meant-- I meant, do you want to have some dinner? Oh yeah. I could do that. - What did you think I meant? - That. Dinner. Okay. Keep doing those exercises. It's important. Nora. Hi. Ed, Francine. How are you doing? Bye. Detective Pluto will be in next week, Teesha. Ed, let's get cracking. Maribel says she's getting a tattoo. - Bullshit. - Yeah? - I'll show you bullshit tomorrow. - Your father said yes? - Uh-huh. - Where you gonna get it? - Mr. Magic, down in the Village. - What street? - Avenue C. - How much does he charge? $45. All right. You can be Baby Bug. - I'm called Lady Bug. - I'm Jewel Bug. - I still don't believe you. - That's because you're Bug Spray. Fuck you, bitches. Juan: Doing good, Ray. You'll catch something. I used to come out here with Maribel. She used to take this fishing seriously. She'd say, "Papi, you gotta be quiet so the fish don't hear you." Then she'd say, "Just whisper." We'd spend the whole afternoon here, whispering to each other. Why did she stop? She's growing up. Now she hates her old man. - Everything I say is stupid. - Nah, she doesn't hate you. I know she says that shit sometimes. She gave me this for my birthday. - That's nice. - Nice, right? She still calls me "Papi," so I know she loves me. Now she thinks she can do whatever she wants. She's telling me, "I'm getting a tattoo." I said, "You're not. You live in my house." She doesn't respect me. I gotta teach her respect. It kills me to do that... but she's still my little girl. I love her. - I think it's a tough age. - You're telling me? You're lucky you don't have a daughter. - I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking. - It's okay. I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. Hey, guys. What's up? - What do you want? - Ping Pong: Do it! Ping Pong, come on. - You know those guys? - No. You okay? - Ray: Yeah. You? - Juan: I'm all right. Those fucking pendejos! Fuck! They shot the fucking fish! - Ray: I think he's alive. - No, man! Is that too symbolic? No, man. We need symbols. I'm telling you, the French bug out for that shit. - Know what I'm saying? - I've been thinking 'bout Cannes. I bet you have, bro'. I see us winning Best Picture. - Don't you? - From which arises a question. Duke: Uh-huh? When we walk up on stage... - to accept that prize... - Right. - which one of us walks first? - We go together. Side by side. Unified. What if the staircase leading to the stage is too narrow for the both of us? Who walks up first? ( intercom buzzes ) - Who is it? - Man: Chinese food. Second floor. All right, man, reality check. We're not walking on any stage until we finish this scene! - Know what I'm saying? - Okay. Both: Yeah. Let's get to work. - Duke: Let's do it. - Cletis: All right. Ann: Chiropractic is primarily manipulation of the spine in order to relieve pain. All I know is my back feels great. And I enjoy getting on that table with you. Ray, I need to talk about what happened. - I meant getting adjustments. - I don't want you to think-- - It was just one of those things. - Yeah, you're right. It was spur of the moment, - but-- - I don't. - You don't what? - What you were saying. Oh. Isn't that what you were just saying? I know myself pretty well. I know I'm not an impulsive person. Got it. I smell smoke. - Can you smell smoke? - No. What? Ann: God damn it! Those people are smoking. Excuse me. - Those people are smoking. - Is it bothering you? No, it's not bothering me, it's killing me. Do you know second-hand smoke causes lung cancer, - heart disease and emphysema? - I'll try not to breathe. It's moments like this I really wish I had a gun. You've got a gun, don't you? No, I'm off duty. I didn't bring it. Pity. - Let's not let it ruin our meal. - Right. - How's the fish? - Great. The chicken? Not bad. Do you want to taste-- They're smoking again! - What are you doing? - Enough of this frou-frou shit. - Man: Jesus Christ! - ( people gasp ) It was her! And good things continue to develop for New York's youngest hero, Ricky Lapinsky. Earlier today, Lapinsky's parents received an offer from Macaulay Culkin for the film rights... That's the kid from "Home Alone." I love that movie. ...reportedly seeking an action vehicle for himself - to write, direct... - Woman: "I see, you see, he/she/it see." - Sees. "He sees the mouse." Everybody else "see" the mouse. Why he "sees" it? This language makes no sense. I'll flunk this test. No, you'll pass. Just relax. "He sees the mouse." Okay, baby. Goodbye. There's chicken in the fridge. I told Maribel to heat it up for you. - Wish me luck. - I wish you luck. Adiosito. Ann: I am really sorry about the whole thing. Smoking is against the law. I could have arrested them. - You should have. - What did the guy say again? "If you persist on throwing food, I'll have to ask you to leave." He said, "young lady," or something. Hey. - Hi, Pluto. - What are you doing? - Nothing. - This is Maribel, - whom I've known since she was two. - Nice to meet you. Did your dad tell you we went fishing? I used your pole, which you were pretty good with. - I was never good. - Okay. - Maribel: Hasta la vista. - Hasta luego. Hasta manana. - Ann: Good Spanish. - Thanks. Sorry about that front room. I'm actually renovating. I'll just eat and run, since I have to go to work early. - Ray: What did you say? - I like candles. They'd work better if you lit them. Ice cream. You left that there so I'd think you're a good boy? I actually do the exercises every day. - All of them? - Except for 7A. - Doesn't do anything. - What? It works incredibly well. Let me see what you've been doing. Ann: Show me. I'll show you. I don't feel anything. It's called the "pelvic lift," which suggests a little elevation. Try again. - Up here. - That high? Yes. Now lower. And raise. - You feel that? - Mm-hm. - It opens you right here. - Ticklish. ( salsa music plays ) Hi, Lucy. Hi, Mirabel. I'm going to get a tattoo. - No, you're not. - Yeah, look. See, mine's in red. Told you. ( whistles ) - What's up, little one? - What are you doing here? Come see. - Is he dead? - Not yet. Get the money! Get the money! I'm sorry, but you better hurry before Mommy comes home and we have to do her ass too! - Go! Where's the money? - I'm getting it. Vamonos! Let's get outta here! Ping Pong: C'mon, let's go! No. - What? - Don't take that. Don't take it? After everything I did for you, you tell me what not to take? We should do her too. ( Juan grunts ) Fucking pendejo. Do his ass again. Let's try it again. You hear the shots. Pow! Pow! Pow! - I run to the window. - You see the Uzi twins - waste the cop. - Our friend! Gone! - Annihilated! - You want to kill them! But I can't, 'cause they're running away, scared. So you yell something at them! I see you, you goddamn Spic bastards! Cletis: I see you! - Yo, somebody saw us! - Cletis: Bastards! I see you! I told you to close the curtain! - Cletis: I see you! - Man: Shit! Go! Go, go, go! Oh my God. Ah! Now that is great exercise for my back. Shut up! I mean it. It hasn't felt this loose in 10 years. Maybe you can incorporate this into your treatment program. Fine with me. I've never had sex with a policeman before. How was it? Can we try your handcuffs next time? Yeah. Yeah. The sun is nice. Are you asleep? I'll take a Double Bun burger with a chocolate shake, please. I had a really nice time last night. Me too. It was great. It's been a while for me, so... - We should get coffee. - I agree. What's with the service in this place? Hey! Hello? Tell you what. If you can get somebody, get me scrambled eggs, - I'll grab a paper. - Okay. Let me get this paper here. Shelley! Ray! Where have you been? Oh my God! Look, Cleo, it's your daddy. Come on, Ray. Let's go home. Okay. Let me just get the paper. Want to say bye to Daddy? Say goodbye to Daddy. I don't have any change. Hey! Shelley! ( banging ) - Duke: Yo, Ray! - ( banging on door ) Mr. Pluto! Mr. Pluto! You better come down! There's some heavy shit going on! - What? - Somebody stabbed the super! - Excuse me. - Hey! Detective. Sir-- Maribel: I don't know. Dimitri: Just answer the question, sweetheart. No. I told you I never saw them before. Look at me. Come on. How did they get in? Did you buzz them in? Leave her alone. What are you doing here? - This is my case. - We got this case an hour ago. - Where were you? - Touch her again, I'll lay you out. Officer: Stop it! You can't come in here! God damn it, Pluto! This is bad, - very bad. - Lieutenant-- Just shut up, because I'm starting to get confused. Are you trying to solve murders or cause them? Why am I responsible because I live in that building? It's never your fault, is it? You never take responsibility for anything, do you? Yes, I do. Let me prove it by giving me this case. Let me have this case, please. You and Cubbins have the body art murder. The guy's a friend of mine. He's hanging by a thread. I know his wife and daughter. Give me one more shot. No. Dimitri's got it. Anything you want to tell me? - About what? - The case. - You got any leads? - You're a detective. - Detect. - Cut the fucking attitude! You got any information, give it to him now! - Sorry. I don't know anything. - Dimitri: Hey, Pluto. I hear the girl and her father were fighting a lot. Who said that? A neighbor said they were going at it pretty heavy. - Heavy? - Yeah. No, not heavy. Just typical stuff between father and daughter. Wait a minute. What are you saying? I'm not saying anything. You're trying to bring her in on this. I can't fucking believe you! That's enough! Get the hell out! That's his only daughter. She loves him. She used to fish with him! She bought him a necklace. She loves him! You son of a bitch! - Get the hell out! - She loves him! Get out of here! Have some respect for your job! Ray: What's wrong with you people? Are you blind? God! He's her father! Ping Pong: "Super... at... hospital... barely conscious." Fucking guy's still alive, Jojo! Not for long. What about us? - It don't say nothing. - Read it to me! It just says it was two guys "that nobody saw, except the daughter, who was unable to give a des-- - des--" - Description! "Police say no other res-- residents wit-- nessed the stabbing." I saw the guy in the window. - He was looking at me! - Then what's going on? I don't know. Maybe they're waiting for us to make a mistake. Maybe this guy's scared and hasn't told anybody. Look at those tears. That shit looks so real. We should have done her. She'll talk. No! She can't touch us without bringing herself down! All we have to do is say the fucking truth. She hired us! You really think that guy's seen us? He called us fucking Spics! - Let's go do him. - No. We're not going to do shit! We just have to sit here and think! We just gotta fucking think! It's a thinking man's game and you're not thinking! So think! We should just go do him! Let's go waste him right now, Jojo! Can you sit down? You're making me nervous. You should be nervous, man. The super was stabbed yesterday. How does that make you feel? I'm bummed for the guy. No, Duke! He was almost killed, right in that window. There's some weird energy coming in here. - Can you feel it? - Yeah, I feel it. It's intense, right? It's very intense, man. That's exactly what's missing from our screenplay. And my biggest problem is the guy in the chair. He doesn't move, he doesn't talk. He just sits there. What do you want him to do? We may have to "illuminate" the whole scene. No, I'm not losing that shit with the darts. That shit's fresh... dope. It's totally whacked. - Why are you talking like that? - Talking like what? "Dope," "fresh," "whacked." - Nigger, you ain't Black. - I know that! - Then talk normal, will you? - Well-- I thought I was, man! Damn! Cubbins: I know this is difficult, Mrs. Fontaine, but do you know anyone who would want to kill your husband? Have you talked to the people next door? - The tattoo parlor? - "Mr. Magic." They've always been jealous of our celebrity clientele. Mrs. Fontaine: They have a walk-in trade, mostly tourists. And you think they might have killed your husband? Doesn't it seem logical? I don't know, Mrs. Fontaine. Maybe it was someone else. - Someone who didn't get it. - Didn't get what? Maybe someone who walked in here and saw all this... stuff and could only see it as a bunch of morons poking fucking holes in themselves. Maybe some guy saw this and said, "That's it!" and shot your husband. What the hell was that about? - That woman just lost her husband! - I'm sorry. Every time I think about Dimitri getting that case... - That's my case! - It's not! It's Dimitri's! Deal with it! Listen to this. I went fishing with the super down by the river. Two Latino punks showed up with a gun. And they were gonna waste him. I gashed one of them with a fishhook that cut him in the neck. If it's the same guys, Maribel may have seen it. Jesus Christ! I hate that brown-nose prick too, but if you know something, tell him! I will, but I want to talk to the girl first. Poor kid, she's probably devastated. What am I talking about? - That's me. - That is not you... - "Loser cop." - That is not you! Only thing they left out is "loser father, loser husband." Cut this shit out right now! Shelley loved you. If she heard you, she'd kick your ass! I shouldn't have bought that paper. What paper? Shelley said to me, "Let's go." And I said, "I want to buy this paper. If you're in a hurry, go ahead." So she went ahead and... I stopped to buy the paper. If I hadn't bought the paper-- I saw the van coming-- I could have saved her. Ray, that is not your fault. That was an accident. Why don't you take off? I'll cover for you in the book. Just go home and take it easy. - All right. Maybe you're right. - You'll be all right. Thanks, man. Come on. I love you, man. Okay? I mean it. Hey, faggot, why don't you just kiss him? Why did you say, asshole? Greasy, fucking fat pig! - I didn't mean it. - What did you say?! Computer voice: You're busted! Hello. You know what, Abdul? I'll need another candle. Which one you like, Mr. Ray? I'll let you pick, this time. Here we go. This one will be good for you. Okay. Wrap it up, my friend. Maribel, do we have money? I don't even know-- Did I pack my card? You've got your card. - Mrs. Benitez. - Hi. - I'm so sorry about Juan. - Thank you. - We're gonna go see him now. - Is he conscious? No, because he lost so much blood. I promise we'll find those guys. And if you need anything, you let me know, okay? Do you mind if I ask Maribel a quick question? - Sure - Thank you. I know this is a tough time for you, but did one the men who stabbed your father have a cut on his face? - A cut? - On his cheek. Maybe it was bandaged. Do you remember? No. Okay. - Thanks. - Come on. - Ray: Hasta la vista. - Hasta luego. Hasta manana. ( phone rings ) Dr. Beamer's office. Teesha speaking. Detective Pluto for Dr. Beamer, please. - How you doing? - Hey. Ann: I've been calling. Did you get my messages? Yeah, I just got them. I just wanted to say I had a really nice time last night. If you every feel the urge to try again-- You know what? Ann... I don't think this is going to work out. - What isn't? - You and me. It'd probably be better if... we didn't see each other again. Was it something I said? Was it because I threw that roll? No. Then why are you saying this? Bad timing, I guess. I'm not feeling too good about myself right now and I guess I'm just not ready for this. Right. Well... goodbye, then. ( knocking on door ) Hang on! Just a minute! How you doing? You remember I told you we were working on a screenplay? We're kind of stuck on a scene, and we were wondering if you could help us. Sorry... I'm a little busy right now. - Is it police work? - Yeah, afraid so. That's why we need your help-- you being a real cop. We got an emergency situation and we need an expert. Yeah, like a technical advisor... which you get as film credit. You know? "Technical advisor: Ray Pluto." - Detective Ray Pluto. - Yeah, you got it. Half hour tops. So, you guys want to tie me up to the chair? Right. We're not a couple of psycho freaks. Though if you'd seen working on that scene with the dummy in the chair... You were buggin'. That's because it wasn't real. - We're mega-realists. - Ultra-mega-realists. - Ultra-mega... - If it's not real, we can't do it. Okay, let's get started. See if I can help you guys out here. All right, you got this... ultra-close. Man, you know what? Thank you. You're saving our ass big time. I got it. Thank you. You know what I'm saying? - ( intercom buzzes ) - That's my Chinese food. Ray: I got to tell you, I agree with Cletis. I don't believe half the stuff I see in the movies. Especially crime movies, and more especially with the cops. - Cops don't act that way. - Uh-huh. Professionally speaking, the stuff you see in the movies-- it's fake. Like those Clint Eastwood movies. - Jojo: Get him in! - ( Duke grunts ) Get him over there! Anybody says a fucking word, you're dead! Ping Pong: Which one was it? I don't know, there's three of them. What the fuck is going on here? Nothing, man! - Why is he tied up? - He's helping us with a screenplay. - What? - "Scrimple"? Why are you wearing them suits? Jojo, come on! Which one was it? - I think it was this one! - No, no, no! - What did I do? - You saw us. I swear I've never seen you guys in my life! - I swear to God! - Shut the fuck up! - I saw you in the window! - Called us fucking Spics! Come on, let's do them all! - Tie 'em up! - No, guys, listen! We never saw you before. We're writing a screenplay. Shut the fuck up with that scrimpe! Please. I'm begging you. Don't do this. I have a wife and a kid. Shut the fuck up! - I've seen you somewhere. - No. Ping Pong, where do I know this guy from? I don't know. Get something for their faces. - I'm sick of them looking at me! - You're turning into a girly bitch! Let's do it and get out of here! Hold the gun. I'll get the bags. Don't look at me. I got one! You guys are making a mistake... killing innocent people. Shut up! - What's going on? - Nothing. Just hurry up! I'm telling you, Ping Pong, you don't have to kill us. Nobody saw anything. You can't even see the apartment from that window. Go ahead. Take a look. Ray: Go on. I got two! Listen to me. You want three murders hanging on your head? Especially when nobody saw anything. Take a look. Take a look. Just go look. That's all I'm asking you to do. Just look out the window. You'll see what I'm talking about. Yeah. Yeah, down to the left. You see? That's right. See? ( screaming ) What was that?! Ping Pong! Jojo: Ping Pong! Ping?! Ping Pong? - Where's Ping Pong? - He went downstairs. - You're fucking dead! - No, you are. You're under arrest for attempted murder. - Jojo: I'll kill you! - Duke: Oh man! Jojo: I'll kill you! I'll kill you. ( Jojo coughs ) - Cletis: You all right? - Duke: Yeah. You? Cletis: I'm okay. Cletis: Yo, Ray. You're awesome. Duke: Straight up. That was hero shit. Totally mega, man. Ultra-mega hero shit. Cletis: I can't believe it. I think they went a little far with this headline. Fact is, this was Dimitri's case, and you deliberately withheld information. You could be facing a demotion for dereliction of duty. ( intercom buzzes ) - Yeah? - Operator: Sorry to bother you. It's the mayor on line two. Good morning, Mr. Mayor. Yes, sir, it's pronounced "Pluto." Raymond or Ray-- we call him Ray. Yes, sir, the promotion is official. Absolutely, you can announce it. Detective First Grade. Yes, sir, we're on our way. Okay, Pluto, let's get outta here. Hey, Ray. Yeah? Congratulations. Thanks, Chick. Lieutenant: Let's move it, Pluto. - I'll do the walkout with you. - I expect no less, Lieutenant. Way to go, Ray. Hero cop. - Thank you. - Good job, Pluto. Fuckin' A. Hey. - Congratulations. - Thanks, Jerry. I'm proud of you. I mean it. You were there for me. I'll never forget it. Come on, girls! Let's cut the hugs and kisses. By the way, any phone calls for me? No. Let's go, Pluto. Follow my lead. Reporter: Detective Pluto, over here! Channel 10 News. Does this... Look at him out there. Old Ray did all right, huh? Don't get too excited. You might piss all over the floor! Something's not right with this case. The punks went back to the apartment to kill a witness, and the girl positive ID'ed them. What's not right? The Medical Examiner told me one of them had a two-day old gash on his neck. So? No way the girl would have missed that on the night of the stabbing. Why didn't she mention it? I think you're all torn up inside because Pluto cleared your case. You're jealous because he got promoted and you didn't. Why didn't she mention it? What did we learn from this? Never buzz somebody in unless you know who it is. Dude, no! No! We gotta get this guy out of this chair. - How? - I'm getting sick and tired of writing this screenplay by myself! All right, my brother. Watch this. How he gets loose is... maybe we didn't tie him so good. All right? He gets loose... he picks up the darts, he starts throwing them at us! You see, there's that symbolism. I like that. I like that. We start getting hit. ( screams ) Fuck, my leg! - All right. Now what? - I pull out my knife! I just pull it out. That's a big blade. That's some Davy Crockett shit right there. He kicks it out of your hand. You go down to get it, he kicks you in the head. - Cletis: Bam! - He rocks me. I'm almost out. - He's gonna kill me. - With what? With his hands. He's strangulating my neck! - So you go get the knife. - Just as you're about to die, - I throw the knife. - Close-up knife, - spinning slow motion. - Sound effects. Knife spinning in the air. Whh! "Thwock!" It gets him in the back. He goes down. - Bam! I get up. - No, you stay down. - I stay down. - He coughs. A mouthful of blood... that hits you. Where?! In yo face. "In Yo Face." - What are you saying, bro'? - We just nailed the scene and the title at the same time! You mean that? You were right! "In Yo Face," that's the movie! Man, I was just going with the vibe. - We both did that! - No! You did it. It was your idea. When we get to Cannes, I'll buy you a six-pack of Dom Periyom! We're fucking going! You know it! Hell, we're going! Parlez-vous! Oui, monsieur! A man so outraged by a cowardly attack on his dear friend and super, Juan Benitez, he undertook a personal quest for justice. He overcame two crazed killers, one armed with a gun, one with a three-foot machete. There was a regrettable loss of life, but in the view of this administration, this man deserves, without question, to be called a hero. Ladies and gentlemen, with this promotion, the City of New York expresses its gratitude to Detective First Grade Raymond Pluto-- or, as we call him, Ray. Ray Pluto. - He'll be all right. - Thanks, Ray. Thank you so much. Teesha: Sorry, Mr. Pluto, the doctor's with a patient. - When will she be done? - Hard to say. We're very busy today. - Ray: She got my message? - Yes, I believe she did. Okay, just tell her... I called again. I'll be home if she wants to call me back. I'll give her the message. Mrs. Benitez: Ray? Do you want to come in now? Hey, Juan. How you doing, man? Look at that. Strong as a bull. You'll be okay. We got those guys. Fucking pendejos. I bet they were the ones doin' the graffiti in the building. Shh... baby, don't talk. Hey, look. You'll be all right. I gotta go. Okay? But... I thought you might... want this. All right, man. Thanks, Ray. Maribel, help him. Well, put it on. Papi. It's okay. You can cry. - Papi. - Mrs. Benitez: He'll be all right. Hasta la vista. Hasta luego. Hasta manana. Teesha: Dr. Beamer's office. Hold, please. Detective Pluto again. The doctor's not available at the moment. Would you do me a favor? - Just write this down. - All right. Tell her... I'm sorry. "Sorry." Uh-huh. - Anything else? - I screwed up. Teesha: So you screwed up. And... - I'm heading over to the river... - River... uh-huh. Ray:...to watch the sunset. - All right. I'd really love it if she'd meet me there. - Teesha: Is that all? - Yes. Are you sure? Okay, thanks. Bye. Ray: She's not coming. Why should she? After what you did? You blew it. Hero. Unbelievable. Hey! Don't try sneaking up on me! All right? You don't know who you're dealing with, do you? Okay. Okay. Huh? Don't you read the papers? Are you blind? It's me. I'm the hero cop. Yeah, Detective First Grade... Raymond Pluto. Of course, we all call him... Ray! Oh Jesus! Shithead! What's the matter? - Hey, what's the matter? - My back went out again. - Careful. - Keep breathing. Ouch! Ooh, I got it. It's the second lumbar. - Okay. - Stand up. Do you think you can walk? You know what? Do me a favor. Grab my gun. It's right behind you. Oh, Ray! Come on! Here, here. Might be a good idea to put the gun in the holster. - Here? - Yeah, right there. - Oh man. - Better? Yeah. I didn't think you'd come. - I wasn't going to. - What happened? Teesha talked me into it. She said, "Give the fucking bastard one more chance." Oh. Well... - I guess I owe her one. - Yep. I guess you do. I'm sorry. - Oh! - Ray?! Are you okay? Sure? - Can you walk? - I'd like to try. Let's go. - Here we go. - You okay? - Don't forget to breathe. - I'm breathing. You kept forgetting your exercises, didn't you? You know... I got busy. I told you, chiropractic is a lifetime commitment. I'm beginning to understand what you meant. Go, go, go Go, go, go It may seem like a cold town Go, go, go But, man, let me tell you, it's a soul town Go, go, go Go, go, go Go, go, go It may seem like a cold town Go, go, go But, man, let me tell you, it's a soul town Go, go, go Go, go, go Go, go, go Go, go, go ( bossa nova music plays )
