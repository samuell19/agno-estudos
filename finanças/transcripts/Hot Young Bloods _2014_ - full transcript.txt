Even that wasn't an obstacle for me. What did you say? I said, you were right to give up! It's already charred! I'm home! Choong Gil... your dad has came back. What did you say? After 8 years being outside, your father's finally home. Also, after this... your mother won't be back home. What did you say, Grandma? Poor kid. You still got grandma. Who's this? It's Choong Gil. Choong Gil, my baby, Let's go! Choong Gil! Go away! What's wrong? Aren't you Choong Gil girlfriend? He touched my girlfriend. I want to collect the same debt. It doesn't feel good to have a debt. What kind of movie I thought.. If the students watch, it could be a problem. Did you hear that sound? No. Did you hear that? Let's take a look! Let's go! See you again. Hey! Who are you guys?

Kang Choong Gil, I can't touch you. It's better if you go. As long as I don't touch So Hee, right? Yeah.. I got it, go. Anyway, your sister ran away wasn't because of me. What time is it?

Did I say wrong? Because you were never home, mom ran out of home. You should be the one apologizing. This punk! Why are you standing by? Hit me! Hit me more! Just beat me till I die! Crazy bastard, what do you think you're doing? Are you nuts? You still think mom ran away because of dad? Mom ran away because she cheated. Dad lied to you, because he's afraid you'll get hurt!
