Hooray for Sato! Hooray for Sanzo! Satô Sanzö will win the victory! Satō Sanzō can't lose! Satō Sanzō will win! Come on, Sato Sanzo! In principle, senators should be independent of parties. I am self-employed... Here, the Communist Party! If you don't like us, Consider this though: parliament should be a fair reflection of everyone's will. It should be composed in this sense. The Liberal Democrat Party won 35% of the vote. and it occupies more than half of the seats! Can we speak of an equitably composed parliament? The communist party is the founder of democracy. Democracy also applies to parliament... Far left demonstration against the Japanese-American security treaty . ''The International ''will be the human race ''Arise, the damned of the Earth!

Inevitably, the village of Ono, within 10 years, finally, in about ten years, will become one with Kashima. He will have to survive with Kashima in this new form. In these conditions, these are high standing residences that will grow, not the agricultural village. Despite this, agriculture could continue in his corner. That's what I'd like to think. You can't build if you don't have the money. There is money here. But the real problem is land. Without land, you cannot build a house. Today, celebrations are based on exchange. Before, when we celebrated a party, what was offered there was not given back. Now if. Well, that has changed a lot. As more and more money is given these days, we return it as a gift. And we'll give money for other people's houses. The sense of obligation is still very strong around here. It allows you to serve. May that we can make a living in Kashima. Few people have money here. It does not prevent them from living comfortably. But deep down, they suck. We don't know how agriculture will evolve in the future. Me, my desire is to see my farm grow. I will do anything for that. But we lack resources. If that doesn't happen, we can eat our crops. But I don't know what will happen under these conditions. That... it was the sum brought by a man. Everything came from the neighborhood. And that was family. It was family. This money went to the deceased. There was also rice. Those who helped shared the rest. But the value of things has increased, so today is different. Look, it 's my grandfather's funeral . And that, those of my father. Everything is recorded at the funeral. The amount offered for my grandfather and the one offered for my father are not the same. The sum offered to the deceased is completely different. The value of things kept increasing. Village firefighters Go on! Attention! Hail command! Everyone in rows! Everyone listen! Our exercise can be performed in 1 hour. I planned to finish it today. But if it doesn't go well, we'll still be there at 10:00. Dad wants a TV this year. One color station: 150,000 yen. Next year or the year after it will be a car to replace the old one. And maybe the next year or even later, he will also want air conditioning. "If you're a man... “What to do in such a situation? ''Green light, are we moving forward? ''Red light, shall we stop? ''You all ''You know it well ''And yet ''We can't stop ''The path of love ''For this pretty young girl ''I will walk through fire and water ''You won't stop me ''Maman ''If we are a man!'' I defer to you and, with all my heart, I ask for your support. People of Ono, vote for Arai Manabu. Arai Manabu! Arai Manabu! I count on you! My name is Arai Manabu. My name is Arai Manabu. Arai Manabu is counting on you! Thanks! Thank you from the heart! I count on you! We count on your advice, your support and your cooperation. We are counting on you! His name is Ogawa Genichi and he's counting on you! This Kashima election campaign will be broadcast tonight at 9:30 p.m. on the general channel of NHK. Don't miss this program! He will be the politician dedicated to the prosperity of Ono. With you he will build a new Kashima where it will be good to live. To all, we ask for your support. In Japan, parties are worth nothing in politics. Our elections are changing in donations of alcohol or money. Especially if you appeal to a sense of obligation. You don't win elections without it in Japan. Especially in regional elections, in small groups, everything is settled by a sense of obligation. This is what regulates elections and work. The sense of obligation is a tradition in Japan. But it would disappear in the event of a citizen revolution. The obligation is not a system in itself. In today's Japan, we have capitalism, appearances of a democracy, so that the political parties do not have recourse to the sense of obligation. But for the regional elections, the obligation takes precedence over the feeling of entitlement. It's the perfect example. They take advantage of it, that's all. Said like that, it's closer to reality. The obligation disappears from government business. The politics of the PS and that of the PLD are vague, but we almost understand. So we vote PLD, PS or PC. For that, it works. But it does not work at the scale of villages and small towns. Today, at the level of the prefectures, it's a big problem. We need citizens who wake up to destroy such a system. People change little by little. We still need 50 or 100 years of history. The PC makes between 200 and 300 voices. PS, between 2,300 and 2,500 votes. Always the same result. Whoever the candidate is, it's the same. In Kashima, political consciousness is very weak. We wonder on what criteria to choose. Myself, I don't really know. Bonjour. Hello. Number 436. Bonjour! Ballot boxes Bonjour! Official dance of the women of the village ''Southern the Sea of ​​Kashima ''The doors of Japan open ''With the port ''With the huge harbor ''Dreams and hopes are even greater ''Go on! ''The construction of the port ''The construction of the port makes the city agitate ''The young people of Kashima are thriving ''Go on! ''He will grow with them ''The huge port of Kashima ''Ramez, ramez ''Southern the Sea of ​​Kashima ''On its pines and its beaches ''The doors of Japan open ''With the port ''With the huge harbor ''Dreams and hopes are even greater ''Go on! ''He will grow with them ''The huge port of Kashima'' Listen, if we wait to be polluted as is the port of Tokyo, it will be too late. In the words of Prefect Iwakami, Kashima mining has been accepted. To these words, I reply that it is not so. Kashima exploitation is not accepted! Look at the situation of the fishermen. The sea is dirty by waste and oil. Fish are inedible. That's where we are in Kashima. No to pollution! Prefect Iwakami promises us that there will never be pollution. But you all know it, the sea is already polluted with oil and waste and the inhabitants of the Kamizu district live as neighbors of this oil dump. The noise it generates was measured at 75 phons. All I want is pure water. If I had pure water, it would be fine. Did you tell them what's going to happen? Did you tell them? They understand nothing. What did you tell them? You are not deaf! Do you only talk to your wife? I'm a woman, me too, I don't have a penis! Let's take off our panties. We are going to fight. Take off your panties and I take off mine. Are you ready? Two against one, sure I can win! What are you going to do if the water is polluted? What will you do? Are you responsible? Yes or no? Hey! You! What are you going to do? Are you not responsible? Are you not responsible? Poor jerk! Go home! Farmers and students in front of the agents of the public works company The Elderly Action Group, they are wealthy grandfathers and grandmothers. They could stay quietly at home. That's what they want to do, after all. But now is not the time to stand there blowing their grandchildren's nose. Among them, there are some who have already one foot in the grave. But they decided to be young. As young as student activists. Kurosawa is the leader of this action. He's young. I call him ''the young Kurosawa''. Kurosawa came to join us. We had to meet. As he approached the guards, Kurosawa took a 20-liter barrel filled with that familiar yellowish shit and threw some at them with a ladle. Voilà! What do mobile guards do? They went to find Kurosawa. They took their truncheons and hit him. They knocked him down and strangled him. Kurosawa has energy, he got up. They put a rope around his waist. They took him away in handcuffs. He said that he wouldn't speak without a lawyer. The brigade leader was annoyed. What to do with an old caker? Well, old Kurosawa came back with dignity at 9:30 a.m. on the places where we are. With a leader like him for our action, no more petty peasant conflicts. The revolution will take place in Japan! imperialism and capitalism will be overturned to their very foundations. We need to. We have to fight! The peasants will fight. They will, trust me. This is neither drivel nor a sermon for kids. I'm not talking to you to talk nonsense. Some groups of students see the workers like enemies because they are building the airport. This way of looking at the situation is widespread. But reasoning like this it is playing the game of monopoly capitalism. And they fall into the trap. Construction workers are different from each other. Some struggle while driving the machines and bulldozers. Yes, there are some like that. There are also seasonal workers. Those of subcontracting companies who, in case of conflict, stand on our side. Today, society and capitalism are full of contradictions. Seasonal workers have no means of action and they are not unionized. They are however very numerous. How to be heard? What form of action is possible? We must seek our own means of action. ''Reason thunders in its crater ''It's the eruption of the end! ''From the past, let's make a clean sweep, ''Slave crowd, stand up, stand up!'' All of you workers! We have no resentment towards you. We ask you today to refuse to work even if ordered to do so. We are counting on you. Stop contributing to the killing of peasants. We are innocent peasants, we don't ask only to continue to live in safety. We're about to to be forcibly removed from our lands. Now, we are determined until death, until they are buried. You all! Face reality and look at us. Our bodies are attached, tied to our fortress. We will protect her until the end! We will go to the end of our action. If you leave, our action cannot... Do not prevent our action from taking place. The mobile brigades no more! Be all our allies! Thanks a lot. far-right party. It's completely ridiculous! In time of war, we do not send women and children on the battlefield. Yet that is what these fools do! Send women and children is a good tactic. The police men would not touch women and children. With a strong government, the dispersal would be orderly and these guys would go to jail for 2 or 3 years. In China or in the USSR, which they admire so much, we wouldn't let them. They would be killed as counter-revolutionaries! This way! Quick! Let's prevent the raid! Let's prevent it! We will fight until victory! Mobile guards, go home! Mobile guards, get out! We will fight until the end! We will fight until victory! We will fight! ''Our world stands on a fortress ''Let's build it with perseverance ''Violent clouds cover the light ''A storm of enemies is coming ''Come, comrades, without retreating ''Let's break the chains of the enemy ''Freedom in pillars of fire ''Spark above our heads...'' No at the airport! Go home! Assassins! You despise people and you run them! Get out of there, it's too dangerous! A comrade is dead! Watch what you are doing! Stop! And you say to protect the life of the peasants! Kanegamitsu Sciences, Asahi Electricity, Kashima Ammonia, Kashima Electrolyse, Kashima Energie Nord, Kashima Energie Sud, Kashima Chimie, Kashima Melamine, Synthetic Yokka, Kanto Silicon and Glass, Kashima Sanso, Kashima Equipment Management Office and Mitsubishi Petroleum, i.e. 13 companies, are celebrating their inauguration together today. It's in loyalty and in all honesty that our partners and we, the prefecture, we were determined to move forward and to join forces in order to achieve this result. This result that we are celebrating today brought us great progress. I don't know how to tell you how much I am deeply grateful to you. In times to come, we will have to face to great difficulty. But the questions we need to think about as human beings touch directly on harmony between Nature and Man. middle classes, the small industrialist, the small merchant, the craftsman, the peasant, all fight the bourgeoisie to safeguard their existence middle classes under threat. They are therefore not revolutionary. but conservative. Moreover, they are reactionary, since they seek to demote the wheel of history. But they are revolutionary insofar as they provide that they will melt in the proletariat. So they don't defend their current interests but their future interests. They give up their own point of view to take that of the proletariat. '' Marx - Engels Communist Party Manifesto -1,848 Adaptation: Delphine Gesland Subtitling: CMC
