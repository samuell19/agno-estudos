IN MEMORY OF PEOPLE'S ARTIST BUI CUONG DEDICATED TO AUTHOR NAM CAO Geez, you scared me out of my wits! Hey Cai! I want to ask you something. I know what it is. It will be embarrassing if someone sees us together. Nothing embarrassing. We'll get married anyway. Our wedding must be fun, right? Yeah, Vang will be the groomsman. Hey Vang! Wanna come to our wedding? See! He accepts! Like it? Vang. Go playing! THE OLD MAN'S DOG You go serve them to pay my debt. Being a maid in Sir Ba's mansion is in a bed of roses, why are you crying? Stay still! Raise your head! You don't look bad. Be a maid in this house, you must be here whenever the bell rings, no matter where you are and no matter what you do. She's here to take care of the third lady. You're no better than a dog when you're poor. I mean my life. The garden is the only valuable thing we have. If we sell it… how can we earn our living… No land no life! Co… Co… Where are you going? Cai, Cai… Cai… Cai… Keep doing it! I just wanna see Cai for once. Guard! - Let me. - Cai, Cai! Cai. She's now the maid here. Nobody can see her. Get out! I just want to tell her one thing. - Stay there! - He dared to hit me. Take him! I'll mark him so you guys remember not to let him in. Wait for me, I'll come to take you back! How dare you hit Sir Ly? Gosh, they're here. I have to go. Co… Take this money, Then go south to work at a rubber plantation. You'll earn some money anyway. Where the heck are you, Co? Come, now! Break the door down! Arrest him! Yes! You want to hide! - Catch him! Moc, catch him. - There he is. Stop! Damn dog, you've bitten me! Poor him. If it hadn't been the dog I'd have put him in jail until he died. If he kicked his groin, would it end our lineage? Don't say such unlucky things. Sir! Your father has called on you! Hey! Send Third Lady this for me. Tell her it's the lotus tea from Mr. Thuong. You're now a village chief who manages hundreds of households. How could you act like that unreasonably? Those lowlives will be unruly and put their feet on our necks if we're not strict with them first. You're still inexperienced, remember that, bully the weak and fear the strong. Moreover, when those crumbs put their feet on our necks, that's time for our punishment. Ah, there is a cup of lotus tea, my mom asked me to give you. How kind! Will you thank her for me please? It's true what they say, that three ducks make up a noisy market. Should all three ducks be chubby, then which one do you want to "eat"? I used hundreds of doses of aphrodisiac, but it's bloody useless. The new bride comes to visit the first and the second lady! This family has its rules. You have to follow them. The first rule, you can't live here if you're unable to give birth. Understand? Water, water, water You call this water? Bring us a drink that we can get drunk on. It's the essence of nature. It's very nice of you not to be afraid of a long trip! Hey, let me down, let me greet Sir Ba's third wife. Oh almighty God, oh almighty God! This village is holding a dragon underneath, so it usually gets angry. This place is sacred but not good. Hey Moc, go see Mr. Hoang. Quick! Yes, here is the essence of nature. If it disappears and appears suddenly, then my visit will be worthless. If I fail to find out the "Dragon Vein". Sir, I thought you came here to do a misfortune cleansing ritual and prepare meds so that the third lady can get pregnant soon? Insolent! Your third lady is a blue-blood. Her child must be a blue-blooded son. But it can only happen if she drinks water from the Dragon Vein. - Got it? - Yes Sir! How kind! Thank you very much! Moc! Look! The Dragon Vein! You two want Mr. Hac? Ah! We were just passing by and saw the well, so we just want to ask for some water. Some people just stare at his garden, so suspicious! They just messed with Sir Ba's family, Don't get involved with them or you'll get in trouble. Mr. Hac, listen to the official's order! You must quickly come to the community house for a hearing. Hurry up! Sir, what am I guilty of? Your fault is… being the father of the one who dared oppose the village chief. My son wouldn't say boo to a goose, SirLy must have… Your son kicked Sir Ly's groin, you keep denying it, huh? Co has gone to work at a rubber plantation in the south. How can you judge him and why did you bring me here? That's it! Then we have to take you to the sub-prefecture so the officials can interrogate you. - Police commissioner Truong? - Yes. No, who will feed Vang if I'm taken to the sub-prefecture? Wait, we can reconsider because it seems you're a good person. But we have been here early for your hearing. Are you really gonna let us leave with nothing? How is it? - This is top secret, - Yes. Can't say it in public. Sir Ba's family have been living on the dragon without knowing. This brings you both good fortune and misfortune. Despite how wealthy and powerful you are, your lineage seems to be uneasy. You're right! My son is already grow-up but he hasn't got married yet. Whatever our advice he never minds. It's my own thing, mom and the second lady please don't mind. Shut up! The village chief who manages thousands of villagers that look down on nature is unacceptable. A sudden death may come to you at anytime. Everything is up to you. I Ba Kien assure a great reward for you. This old well is the "Dragon Vein". Whoever has the "Dragon Vein" will own the whole world. Should you want peace and fortune, you must move your ancestor's grave here. Mr. Hoang, how about my third wife's pregnancy? Told you. You have the "Dragon Vein", you have everything. Just use the water from that well for the making of medicines. It's not possible, ma'am. My husband feels sympathy for your situation so he offers you such a high price as this. This is my ancestor's land. I can't sell it, ma'am! Your garden looks green, doesn't it? There wasn't a drop of rain last month, but thanks to this well. So now you see! My garden is still growing well like this! Honestly, there is a fortune teller saying that my sickness can only be cured by water from your well. So I'm here to… Please just ask him to come here for water, I don't mind. What? Refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit! Let me see! Shut up, don't you know who I am? Moc. Mung! - Yes! You called me. - Help! Hey, the girls baling water By the road Why did you bale the moonlight out too? My moonlight Hey, the guy is hoeing up The ground there Don't be curious You will cut your leg Or even your c…o…ck. Sir Ly is here. Can I tell you something? Nonsense! Go to the village's communal house to tell. Sir Ly, you like the girl in pink or yellow? I can be the matchmaker! I don't like female villagers. Hey, Sir Ly! You're like the star fruit Falling into the garden I'm like the girl craving for sour things Craving for soul things Hey hey, why on earth have we a man who always runs away when he sees girls? The other day I passed by your garden with the third lady and the fortune teller. I know. He told Sir Ba that the well - Hi, Sir Ly. - Hi. He's so scary! Sir Ba's eldest son? The day I left, he was as timid as a rabbit. Now he's the chief. Recognize me? Binh Tu? FATHER - MOTHER - GRANDFATHER You guys must learn by heart the poem I've taught. Yes! Pray God for rain So we have water to drink Have fields to work on Have bowls full of rice Have brooms to clean the house - The rooster picks rice - Excuse me teacher, I want to ask if we have many rivers in the place where Co is living? Phu Rieng is located in Dong Nai province, it has lots of rivers. We have been through some harvests since he left here… but I haven't heard anything from him yet. Then… I've come to ask you to write him a letter. Do you know his address? No. Once sent, it will arrive one way or another. So wait, I'll get ink and paper. You already knew that letter couldn't be sent, why do you still lie to him? Sometimes we can't just tell the truth, but honest white lies may help. In this village, they'll call you a fool if you're gentle. Once a fool, forever a fool. Damn it! Nobody comes to see me? When were you back and why didn't you inform me? I have spent two years in prison, spent three years in the military, I didn't fear arrows or bullets though. Then I fucking fear nobody! Hey Binh Tu, watch your mouth as you're currently in the community house. You shouldn't swear like that in front of your wife and kid anyway. Wife? She told me everything. Fuck, The deputy village chief passed by after gambling late. You, village commissioner, also flirted with my wife. Even you too, police commissioner Truong. All of you! Binh Tu, do you know how defamation would be punished? You slut! Am I right? Speak! Have you all seen it? Have you all heard it clearly? I'll kill her if she lies. And I will kill anyone who dares to flirt with my wife. I wanna go to jail now! Oh dear, it's Binh Tu here. How brave! Hi Sir Ba! A brave man shouldn't let his family live in poverty like this. Go buy food and clothes for your kids. Thank you, sir. And you. Why don't we have a drink together? Co! It's been years and you have not written me any letters. Vang and I miss you so much! Hey, Vang! Catch this. Oh Vang! You're home. Why are you home so late, I was really worried! Good boy. Stay still, let me see! Oh… Why did you take it back? You… You wet my letter. If your dad doesn't get that letter he'll hate you! Got it? I'll ignore you! Ah no. No. I love you. Nobody loves you as I do! Let me write another letter to send to your dad! Stay still! Ah oi… Ah… An ant tried to shake a big tree You rejected me for being poor Who else would you marry to be rich Ah oi Where are you taking the buffalos to? This is my garden. Get out… Get out. Vang, Vang! - Go! - Quick! Get out! Vang. - Go away… - Go. Get out of my garden… ‪Get out. - Get out. - Hey, what are you doing? Why are you doing that? Call your buffaloes back. I beg you. - Don't take away my buffaloes. - Go. Sir, these people are not from our village. Call on those buffaloes to get out. Catch them all. I will leave them to rot in jail for vandalism. Yes! Go. You keep planting, they keep destroying. You can't fight against them alone. Your neighbors cannot help you in this matter. I cannot be here in time to help you because it's too far. Please go back home, leave me alone. My father still wants to buy your land. Your tax payment is due soon, by the way… have you prepared enough money yet? Good… Good boy! Tie like this to ease your pain, okay! Right…let me see… Have you heard it? Mr. Hac's garden was badly destroyed! Gosh! He's such a nice man, who would ever do that to him? I suppose… I only dare to say when Sir Ba is not home. Nothing, he'll kill me if he knows I'm blabbing. What happens here, stays here. Understand? Yes! Understood! But… I care about Mr. Hac. All the water for your medicines is from the well at Mr. Hac's place. Hey, where are you taking my books to? It's no use keeping them! Sell them to get money to help people. My god! Do you know all these books are rare? These books are rare, but can't be turned into medicines. Don't you recognize that Mr. Hac is getting skinny? Teacher, you want to cross the river? Remember the day when the levée breached, I threw all the clothes and stuff just to save these books. See, there are still lots of water stains here. We cannot sell these books. We will find another way to help Mr.Hac. - Go there to clean. - Yes. Thanks for helping me. Thank you. Thank you. Let us know if you need assistance next time. This is a gift from Sir Ba. Please! Drink to forget everything. Regarding Mr. Hac's garden, don't push him too far, my dear! I heard that a gang of buffalos came to destroy his garden and Ly Cuong was the instigator. It's none of your business. Your business is to get pregnant. You've been here for several years. Still no child. My two other wives won't let you live in peace if you're still childless. Got that? Cai. Cai… I will come back when I have enough money. I will take you out. Wait for me! Vang! Why are you here alone? Sometimes he gets here, he may miss Co. Do you have any news of Co? Please come in and have tea. I come here today… honestly, I would like to ask you to teach me to write. You should learn from childhood, now it's really hard for you to remember. I will try my best. I want to write to Co by myself. This is letter "A", round shape, with a hook. Remember? Letter "A" looks like an egg with a fishhook. Good, now…good boy, good boy. Remember? Vang! I owe you a life. Understand what I'm saying? He will get better if he is fed. Yes, thank you. If you hadn't helped, I wouldn't have been able to survive and reunite with my family. Not a big deal. We're all neighbors, so don't mention it. Yes. I'm sorry. I gotta go. Someone wants to harm you deliberately. Then please take care! Kick it! - Kick it hard! - That's right! Dismiss! Who the hell dares stop the fight? Dismiss now! I asked who the hell is rudely speaking? Your father is speaking. My apology, father, I didn't notice. Get lost! Sir Ly, you don't have anything else to care for other than these cockfights? I do deal with many important things, keep the population and land records, collect taxes, - Really? - Prevent riots, - and… - Stop. The most important thing right now is to take the "Dragon Vein." The ancestor's grave must be moved before the Tet holiday. Dog bait. Oh my god! Vang, Vang, Vang… Where are you Vang? Vang, Vang… Oh my God. Vang is here… Do you know someone is trying to harm you? Stupid. Stupid. You're stupid. You have to put it into his food to poison him. Stop! You're grown-up but not smart. I need the well, I need the land. Why do you just keep worrying about that dog? That goddamn dog. You eat. I know that you're not full yet. Here… Here… Yeah Come on. Let eat … good It is fine for me to hungry a bit. I am getting used to it. Come on…good boy. I don't know if I have anything else to feed you next? Teacher! Teacher! What happened? Someone wants to destroy your garden again? I have no choice but to sell Vang. Why do you have to do that? There's nothing left for him to eat. It will be a good deal if we sell him now. My tax payment is due soon, anyway. Just wait, perhaps we will find another solution. Why do you have to come here just to say this? I'm afraid Vang will hear this. He'll be sad. Poor him! Not sure if he heard what I just said to you guys? I must go home now. Vang! Let's go home. Ma'am! You want to take medicine right now or later? Give it to me. Ma'am… How are you? Let me see. Cai. Take her to get rest, Yes, ma'am. Give her some water. Yes, ma'am. Be careful. She acts as if she were a princess. She was still a peasant on the field few years ago. She's lucky our husband brought her as his third wife. You shut up! Why do you nag me? From the look of things, she is already pregnant. You'd better worry about yourself. Please enter the temple. I'll wait outside. Why do you want to see me, ma'am? Please don't call me ma'am. I'm just the same age as your child. I'm from the south. We were so poor I had to become Sir Ba's third wife. I and Cai are alike. I'm pregnant because of the water from your well. Will anyone get an incense burner please? Let me do it. How is it? Congratulations! It's a boy! The conception has occurred right in zodiac period. He will be born to be a person of rank. How blessed! All your prayers are answered. Great bliss… great bliss. We must open a big party to celebrate this event. The third lady's not here yet. Sir! musical instruments are ready. Do you want to start now? Hold on, I want my son to be able to hear the music from his mom's belly. Play it. Now we are men of wealth Be grateful to the creator Life is like a dream You dream of the great thing I dream of you Ma'am. - Take the third lady in. - Yes sir. Hurry up! You guys hide inside. But… please just catch him till he finishes his food. Hey… Hurry up. Nobody pays such a high price like us. Hey… Where is Vang? Vang… come here to eat. Vang… Come home to eat. Hey… Vang… Come here… This tastes good! This tastes good! Hey… Eat… Hey… This is your favorite. Just eat… Come here. Eat… Vang… Eat… No. Catch him. Catch him. The diamond, have you found the diamond to cut yet? Just wait. You're still tired, where do you want to go? I want to buy some star-fruits, been craving for sour things. - Moc. - Yes. You go with the third lady. I already called Cai. Hey you! - Oops! - I'm over here. Let's hide. Gotcha. Wrong one… Wrong one… Then I'll just try one more time! Will your parents accept a poor guy like me? My mom likes you. The problem is my dad. But my dad loves me a lot. You pestle these gingers finely, then use them for the third lady's foot soak. Yes sir. - Hi Sir Ly. - Ah… Binh Tu, I have a task for you. What is it? Have you seen if Mr. Hac's garden is growing well again? You and your dad have not given him enough trouble yet? Fine if you're not interested in money, I will easily find another one. You want to hurt him, you must kill me first. I'm Ly Cuong, not my father. So I will treat you differently. The sky is high above our heads Move the cloud And you'll see the blue sky You bring it to Mr. Hac. You treasure these books very much, don't you? You won't earn much by selling them. Books are dirt cheap in the decline of culture. You think you can escape by jumping into water? Vang. I am going to buy wine. Stop, are you gonna let me do it alone? I'll be right back. Don't be smart with me. You want to take some money for wine? Then we will go together. Wine here, wine here. Good wine. Got all the seasonings? Don't worry, the bunch of apricot leaves is enough. Ma'am, please have some porridge. Gamecock legs cooked with green peas are really healthy. Have you… Oh dear, your health is more important than this cock. I cooked it myself. The lotus tea can't compare with this. It's delicious! I can give you whatever you like. The troupe came here last time is excellent. Can you invite them again? Everyone? Yeah! Do I have to introduce myself? If not, how can we know who you are. I… I'm Teu, born in Meu Village. Good people, I give money, bad people, I give a punch. My skin is fair because I love sunlight. My voice is echoing because I love singing. Do you guys recognize my voice? Yes! I miss every single acquaintance of mine. I hope to see them again. Why are you doing this job? Because it brings me the chance to find you. I have been traveling from place to place for years. Do you hate my parents since they forced me to get married for money? I'm used to tragedies. I'm satisfied, seeing you this time. Do you have a good life as the third wife of Sir Ba? No love, no happiness, it's a marriage in name only! Hey, we see each other every once in a while. Why are you crying? Ma'am! The puppet show is done. I have to go now. Mo! I'm staying here in a few days. We'll meet again. You're home? Vang… Come here with me. Oh… Good boy… Good boy Hey… Hey… Listen to me. Days without you are really sad! You know what? The house is so empty without you. I thought you would never come back. Hey… Stay still… Ew… Where have you been? Why are you so dirty? Let me see whether you get lice or not! Stay still. I'll help you search for lice, if any. Good boy. God… How can you come back here? I already took their money. Go… Go away… You're no longer my dog. You belong to someone else now. Get out… Get out now… Go away… Please forgive me. Please don't hate me. I love you to the moon and back. Vang… Tell the truth or die. Why did you and the third lady come home late after the show? Ma'am, we came home right after the show. Liar. Someone saw you were looking for the third lady at the end of the show. Is it true? No, I swear. You swear, you swear… you swear. - I swear it was true! - Swear… Swear. Fool… where is the evidence? It's a shame if it's exposed. It's obviously adultery. There's only one way to hide this. Hurry up. Ly… Ly… I need your help, it's… - You go first. - Yes. I know what it is, but his fault is quite big. We're just old acquaintances. Please have mercy on him. I will jump into the fire, or I will even die if you tell me to do so. But what do I get in return? Tell me what you like, I can ask Sir Ba to prepare it. There are things that only you can give me. But if you're not okay with my request, I'll go now. Ly… Ly, calm down. No, I will be dead if Sir Ba finds out. Why do you have to fear my father while I'm really in charge here? No… It can't be. I thought you didn't get married because… Because I'm not into girls, right? All the girls in this village are nothing to me. You know why? Because of you. No, please…please don't I thought you wanted to trade your life for his life. It's day now. Wait for me at the granary tonight. You will have everything you want. Nobody has ever dared to break the promise with me. Remember that. Please don't forget what I asked earlier. Sir, they all hid away. Find them. - Yes sir. - Yes sir. Lucky for you that I keep my promises. Damn it. A dependant is not a real man! - Let me go! - Go. Go! Quick! Let my husband and children go. Get off me! Hey! Go with me! - You! - My child. Fuck it! - Quick! - Let me go… She deserves a head shaving, then tie her and float her down the river. But she's carrying my own son in her belly. She will be punished after giving birth. Hey. You stay home and guard her well. Sir, but if she needs… Only Cai can bring her food and water. Yes. That slut doesn't even deserve dregs. Did you see Binh Tu? Bring Pham Van Hac, Pham Van Co here. On your knees. Why is there only the father here? Where is the ungrateful son? The Judge, everyone knows that Co went to work at a rubber plantation in the south long ago. Rules are rules. Long undeclared absence now counts as presence in the area. All types of taxes must be fully paid anyway. Land tax and poll tax for two people are nine Dong in total. Nine Dong? How can I have nine Dong? Taxes are compulsory. People in this village are so stubborn indeed. Judge, according to the customs of the council of notables, one's properties will be seized and then put on sale if one cannot pay enough tax. In addition, the village chief suggests that the indictee must pay nine Dong as a penalty for age fabrication. So it's 18 Dong in total. I'm innocent, Judge! I'm over 60 this year, which means I don't need to pay taxes. That's the law. The Judge, according to the record, Pham Van Hac was born in the year of the snake, which means he's 47 now. Judge, please look at me. Does anyone believe I'm only 47 years old? There is neither witness nor birth certificate for this man. - Guards! - Yes. Wait. Okay, as per Sir Ba's advice, and that you're also an old man I give you three days to pay your taxes, otherwise you will be taken to the sub-prefecture. That land has to be mine. You're wrong, Sir. That land belongs to my son, Co. Stop, you can't fight against me. You will lose, and I will win anyway. Let's… see. Quick! Cheers! I want to see The Judge. For what? I want to sue the chief and his dad. Sue for what? For forcing Mr. Pham Van Hac and for attempted demolition. Let me see. - This dish is good. - He interrupted my meal! An ant is trying to shake a big tree. Okay, just take it and go home, I will check it tomorrow. I'll go to the county or district to sue them if it it's not possible to do so here. Keep drinking. - Catch him. - Yes sir. Teacher. Let go of my teacher. - Teacher… - What are you doing? This is evidence of an attempted anti-government riot. My husband is not guilty. Please let him go. - What the hell are you doing? - Release my husband… Let him go… Sir Ba, I want to see him. Where is Sir Ba? I need to see him. Moc. Moc, where is Mung? Ma'am, I'm guarding down here. Anybody! Sir Ba. What happened? Sir Ba, give me a bottle of wine. No wine for the son of a bitch. Get out. - Guards! - Yes! How stingy! I don't fucking need it anymore. Moc, who is guarding the granary? Why are you here? Your wound doesn't heal yet, be careful. I don't know how to thank you. Quick! Let me do that by myself. No Ly, please don't. I got pregnant with your father. So what? You have to be mine. No! Mo. We won't escape if we don't go faster. You're so kind. I'm broke now so. I don't know how to repay you? I don't do this for money. Then why did you save us? You know Vang, Mr. Hac's dog? A dog even knows how to behave kindly towards others, while people don't. - Stop! - Hurry up. Stop! Catch them! Catch them! No! Here, have some. It's not as good as the food back in the day. Now we are broke, then we don't have any choice. Please eat, Vang. Mr. Hac! Why is it so noisy? I'm going to visit my husband, so can you watch my house please? Why are they so cruel? We are all neighbors but some still treat their neighbors as wild animals. They have power. We are just lowlifes, it's like throwing eggs against rocks. Don't be pessimistic. We still don't know who is better, teacher! Co! I keep this land as a marriage portion for you. This cup of wine I drink with you, my wife. I'm seeing you soon. We can be together again. I'm so happy. Hac, who led a decent life Please rest in peace Please rest in peace… Mr. Hac, please rest in peace… Find that document at all costs. Hurry up… hurry up. Dig… Keep digging. Think you can bring the document with you? Hurry up. Hurry up. Sir, I'm scared. Useless! It's just been buried, nothing to be scared of! Hey, beat him up. Kill him. Beat them up! I have enough money to take Cai out. Sir Ba? Where's Sir Ba? The "Dragon Vein"…the "Dragon Vein"… The "Dragon's vein"… I'm not Ly Cuong, Don't bite me… You still want to go? There's nothing worth staying for here. Teacher, Teacher! Please help me keep all the money by selling Vang. Until Co comes home…
