(discordant music) (bright music) (warm music) (dog barking) - You hush. - Ain't a cow dog, that's a whore dog, Charley. - That's my dog, don't embarrass him. - See you got yourself another orphan there, huh? - Looks to me like I got myself a bunch of bankers. - What'd he mean by that? - Means get to work. (groans) (chickens clucking) (rooster crowing) - Breakfast is cold. You coulda let Brian play nursemaid. - Had to get that calf started. - Are we gonna talk about it, or not? - What am I supposed to say? - I'm your wife. - It's a hell of a place. You're never gonna get out of it alive. - [Operator] Overseas operator, may I help you? - [Adrienne] Yes, I need to talk to Paris. - [Operator] Just a moment, please. (energetic tense music) (cowboys speaking in French) (telephone ringing) - Hello? Oui. Maman! Charles is not at home right now. What is the matter? (Adrienne speaking in French) (cowboys speaking in French) Rene! (energetic tense music) - [Rene] Papa! - Hey (speaking in French). (Rene speaking in French) (cowboy speaking in French) The good guy has his problems, huh? (cowboy speaking in French) Bonsoir. - Bonsoir. - Finally, some money. Once again, they threw away my best stuff, but this is good enough for celebration, don't you think? Hmm? I've even gonna pay back your family. (Adrienne speaking in French) (people screaming) (energetic tense music) With the... (grunts) Where is the damn corkscrew? - I said your father is dying. - I heard you. - Charles, it has been 15 years. If there was ever a reason to go back, I think it is now. (Charley sighs) (airplane roaring) - Charley! - Mom? (Laura laughing) Mom, let go so I can look at you. - I thought I'd never see you again. - Yeah, well, I'm here. - Yes, you are. All right, now let's get you out to the ranch. - How's Dad? - He's waiting at home. - Is he in bed? - No, it hasn't got to that, not yet. It's just that I wanted you here, you see? They say it could be any time now, they can't be sure. He doesn't want anyone to know about this. - Okay, Ma, I understand. Brian. - Brian drove me, that long ride to town. It isn't as easy for me as it used to be. - How are ya? - Just fine, just fine. - It's been a long time. - Yes, it has. Well, that all your stuff there? - Yeah. - Excuse me. - He's been a real help to us. (sparks crackling) - You old outlaw! How'd you get back in the country? - Hello, Homer. (Homer laughing) You still got it. - Yeah. (laughs) - Hello, Dad. - Hello, Charley. - I'm glad to be back. - You look in good health. - You look just fine. - Charley, Jr., this is Abner. He's new since you left. - Heard about you. - Oh, I bet. - You want me to take his bags in? - I'll get it. - Abner had no call to be rude. - That's just his way. I'll get some more welding rods from the barn. - Charley! Now you can spare a minute to visit. I've made some fresh ice cream, your favorite. - [Charley, Sr.] I don't expect this is any easier for you than it is for me. - [Charley, Jr.] Probably not. (laughs) - [Charley, Jr.] 15 years, still ashamed. - Ashamed, of what? - FBI man comes to my house, dead of night. - Charley, that was years ago! - Was I hiding him, he asked me, hiding you! - I didn't hide. I walked away, big as day. - When you called me from Paris, I told you, "You break the law, don't come runnin' back to me." - Yeah, that's about the last place- - You cut and run! (pensive music) (knocking on door) - My, aren't you well turned out! - I can't believe you saved all this stuff. You know, this is the in thing in Paris right now. - It's the in thing here too. Here. - Here. - Aw, no, come on. (laughs) What's this? - Scotch. - If I read between the lines of Adrienne's letters, you drink too much. - Oh, Mom, I'm 38 years old. Quit acting like my mother. - I am your mother. - It's for Dad. (Laura gasps) It's his favorite brand. The whole world's getting over Vietnam. Why the hell can't he? - You need to give your father some time. - I thought that's what we were short of. That looks great, Ma. - [Laura] Try some. - See you built a new barn. - [Charley, Sr.] Yeah. - Homer's still tryin' to keep that old tractor goin', huh? - Oh, yeah. - How's beef? - Up a little. Yeah. Yup. (Charley, Jr. speaks in French) Yeah. - We're gonna eat just now. Grace, Charley. - Dear, God, we thank you for your bounty and the freedom we all enjoy, and the men who paid for it, amen. - Dear, would you please cut the roast? - Look, in World War II, I had buddies who died so we could all sit here and eat supper. - I had buddies who just died. (sighs) I didn't come 6,000 miles to talk politics. - What did he come for? - To be with you. - I am not a charity case. - Fine. - Look, I figured I'd be dead inside of six months, but before you get all choked up- - Don't worry, I've got a ticket that says I'm gone inside of three weeks. - Please, will you two stop this? You can't hate each other so much. - Hate him? I don't know you. When you were that high, I taught you if there's any quit in you, you can't reach, you can't live. I don't know what that boy grew into. - Your son. - I've got no son. (chair clatters) (woman singing indistinctly) - You mean to tell me that he's chasin' wild steer out in the back of the yard? You know, one of the big-horned monsters that had a couple of years to go crazy? Get off of there! Count on someone like Charley, Jr. to (indistinct)? - Why don't you lay off him? (indistinct) And all them boys. - Don't give me crap. A leopard don't change his spots. Brian says Charley, Jr.'s a traitor, so I figure he is. - Hold on. He got that graded Silver Star, for God's sake. - Yeah, with white feather for high-tailin' it. That's what I call a traitor. - He went AWOL, absent without leave when he was on R and R. Now, that ain't good, but that don't make him a traitor. Traitor's somebody that helps the enemy. - What does a deserter do? Hell, we're all traitors. Ain't that right, Brian? - Wanna talk to you about some extra hands for the roundup. (woman singing indistinctly) - Abner, you jabber too dang much. (Brian sighs deeply) - I'll go into town tomorrow and put my ear to the ground, see who's available. (Charley, Sr. grunts) Don't want any drugstore cowboys. - Nope. - When you wanna start? - End of the week. - [Brian] Same wage as before, 35 a day (indistinct)? - I'll be broke by summer. - You always say that, Charley. - Ever tell you about my granddad, built this place, what happened winter of aught-eight? - [Brian] Only about 100 times. - My dad, how he fought to hang on, drought in '33. - Ah, just about as many. - They gave me a gift, Brian. I always figured I'd add on to it some way. - Well, Charley, you electrified the boar holes, you put in all that fencin', brought in that fancy account last year. - (scoffs) They'd roll over in their graves. I wonder lately if it's worthwhile. - Course it is. - Man's gotta have a legacy, something he can pass on. You understand what I'm tellin' you? - Yes, sir, I think I do. (warm pensive music) (bright music) (horse whinnying) (billiard balls clacking) (Charley humming) - Nell Harris. - (squeals) Look at you! (Charley groans) Oh, look at you. - You look just fine. - Charley, Jr. Oh, come on, sit down. Just tell me what you're gonna have. - Well, how 'bout a couple of drinks? And champagne for the house, you name it. - I'm on duty here! - Well, listen, we gotta talk. What have you been up to? - Oh, I've been up to this, that. (laughs) - Did you get married again? You got more kids? - My daughter's up there at the JC. - Oh, she can't be that old. - [Nell] Charley! - Oh, I'm sorry. (Nell laughs) Well, she would be that old, wouldn't she? - I'm afraid so. - What about marriage? - Marriage, it's like divorce, huh? Just a piece of paper. How 'bout you? - Yeah. - Well, good to have you back. Now, come on and sit down, tell me what you're gonna have! - No, no, no, wait, I wanna talk to you. - I can't. - Okay, I tell you what, bring me the City Cafe's famous double chili cheeseburger, hold the onions, and a beer. I'm gonna stay right over here until your shift's over. - Bottle or can? - Well, you choose, madam. - Bottle always sounds better when you chuck it out the window. - Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah. (laughs) - I'll give him nothin'. That's what on the menu for yellow-bellies. - All right, fine, then I'm gonna walk right outta here. And in exactly 22 minutes, you're gonna be dealin' with a tour bus full of people who've been ripped off at the Gila monster farm. - Aw, hell. (billiard balls clacking) (warm upbeat music) - Couple of beers. All right with you? - [Nell] Sure. - Look at this. I've forgotten what great atmosphere this place has. - You must be kiddin'. - No, this is the real McCoy. Welcome to NRA, red-blooded Americana. - [Nell] (laughs) Is that good? - Well, it's home. - I'll drink to that. (camera clicks) Do you need a flashcube? - Mm-mm, super-fast film. (camera clicks) - I hate flashcubes, always makes my eyes look so red. (camera clicking) - Hey, Brian. How you doin'? What brings you to town? - To get us some cattle and a few more hands. - I could throw in. (Brian laughs) I might even enjoy it. Do you know Nell Harris? - Yes, I do. - [Nell] Excuse me, I'm gonna go to the ladies'. - [Captain] Hello, Nell. - [Nell] Captain. - I remember when we were about 10, rolling these in your father's tool shed. We nearly burned the place down. He almost had a coronary chasing us. - Still don't know how he caught me. - Well, Brian, you were never known for being quick. Hey, who was that scrappy tight-end we used to have? Carson- - Carter, Lester M. - Lester M. Carter. He was somethin'. Too bad he wasn't bigger, he coulda gone on to the pros. - Hell you talkin' about? - Football, I'm talkin' 'bout football. - Lester Carter got killed fightin' the gooks you was supposed to be fightin'. My daddy woulda caught you too if his leg hadn't been shot up in Iwo Jima. Shoulda never come back. - But I did. - Well, when you goin' back? - Don't push it, Brian. (shot glass clangs) - Some of us stayed, CJ, and we didn't get no damn medals for it either. But not you, good buddy, not you. - Fine, good buddy, I'm not gonna fight you on this. - You don't deserve your daddy. Honest to God, you really don't. - You're right. The atmosphere in this place stinks. - Told you. - [Charley] Want a cookie? - (indistinct) Sittin' around my cafe all afternoon. - [Brian] So? - [Cafe Owner] In my war, they'da shot a fellow like that. - What'd he ever do to you? - (laughs) Well then there now. You hear that, Winoon? Sounds to me like he thinks old Charley MacLeod's boy's the prodigal son come home. - Give me another beer. (glass shattering) - You like it over there, in France? - Yeah. - Better than America? - No. - So what took you so long to come back? - Well, you leave like I did, you don't expect a brass band to welcome you home. - Took a big chance comin' home, Charley. - They don't seem to care anymore. It's crazy. The whole damn thing was crazy. You're probably the only one in this town who could understand. - Understand what? - Why I couldn't do it anymore. - Charley, what happened over there? - I don't wanna talk about it. - Okay. You know those protestors I saw on the TV? I mean, they said that they were against the war. But then why were they cheerin' for that (indistinct) fella? - Maybe they felt they had to. - They were Americans, and they were for the other side! I don't know. I never agree with that, Charley, never. - Our lease on government range has gotta be rebid in two years. I see old Ray Alan Swanson's givin' this land his greedy eye. You know, bid prices may be up now, but take at least two years to pay off the debt we got piled up. Who knows if prices will hold. (scoffs) 1/3 of the cow and calf operations in this state are goin' belly up. (sighs) Ranching is no business at all if you want to make- - If you want to make money in this life. - Any money in this life. - (laughs) You sound just like your father. Oh, come to bed, Charley. (keyboard keys clacking) (computer beeping) - You know, Brian's got a little cash salted away. - Brian? - You could sell your share to him. He could pay you off regular every month. - The land to Brian? - This ranch is everything I stand for. I can't throw it away on Charley, Jr. - Well, you can't disown our son. - I heard the boys talkin' about him. It's starting all over again. - You can't still be that angry! You've gotta let go. - I have. You get 75% of the outfit, Brian Winoon gets the rest. (computer beeping) (keyboard keys clacking) (horse hooves clopping) (men yelling) (horse whinnying) Good mornin', glad to have you back. Thanks for helpin' out. - Yeah, I'm glad to do it, Charley. You helped me last year. (men yelling) (horse whinnying) - Mornin'. - Mornin'. (men yelling) (horse whinnying) - Eat somethin'. - Mom, I... Bye. - Charley, your dad's thinkin' of givin' part ownership of the ranch to Brian Winoon. (Charley sighs) - Well, that would just about ice the cake. - He doesn't know what else to do. - I can't help him. - You're as prideful as he is. - I'm not a rancher, so it doesn't matter. - It does matter. This land has been in the MacLeod family for three generations. It's all he has to give you. - (sighs) You asked me to come home, so I did. What else you want me to do? - You came home because I asked you to? (scoffs) I thought you came home because your father was dying. - I know, I'm sorry. You know what I mean. - No, I don't think you know what you mean. When you figure it out, go tell your father. I think he'd like to hear it. - (sighs) you know, for a peacemaker, you got a hell of a style. - Hey, stay put. I'll get you somethin' won't get you into any trouble. - Ah, that's okay, I'm not a side-saddler. You just point one out. I'm gonna catch him. - Got you. (horse grunting) Whoa! Easy. Whoa. Whoa! Settle. Whoa! Got him, easy. - You remember how to put this on? - Whoa, easy. Yeah! Whoa. Whoa! Ooh. (horse whinnying) (horse whinnying) - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. (horse whinnying) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - Whoa, whoa! - Whoa, down! Back off. (horse whinnying) Easy, easy. (Charley grunts) - Yee-haw! - Whoa! - Look out! - Hold on, hold on! (horse grunting) (horse whinnying) - [Man] All right. (indistinct) - Damn. - [Ranch Hand] Atta cowboy! (horse whinnying) - [Ranch Hand] All right! Hold on, hold on! Stay on, you got it. (horse grunting) (wood clattering) (wood clattering) (horse whinnying) - Well, nice thing about a horse, there are no metal parts when you get into a wreck. - Leave him alone, partner, and get another. (Charley panting) Come on, boys! The boss wants to know why you ain't saddled up! Come on, let's hook 'em! Oren, come on! We oughta be 10 miles from here to (indistinct). Come on! - Well, now, look like you could use some practice, partner. (Charley, Jr. groans) (horse whinnying) (Charley, Jr. grunts) - Whoa, whoa, no, no! (wood crashes) (Charley, Jr. grunting) (Charley, Jr. Groaning) - Hey, Charley, that horse won't be rode. Some day, I'm gonna have to shoot him. Go get cleaned up. We'll get started. (Charley, Jr. panting) All right (indistinct). (adventurous music) - [Abner] (laughs) Barely, all right. (tense pensive music) - Well, let's get started. - All right, come on. Go! Okay, come on. (adventurous music) - You all right? - I'll live. (man yelling) (Homer yelling) (warm music) (cattle lowing) (men yelling) (Brian yells) (camera clicks) - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! (tense music) - Get that steer down the draw there! Brian! - I got him. (adventurous music) - I'll get him, boss. (tense music) - Brian! (steer groans) Crossed my line! What the hell do you think you're doin'? - Cut him loose! It's too big for him! - Yeah, cut him loose! - Hell, I will. Look out! (steer groaning) (horse whinnying) (Charley, Jr. groans) Ho, ho, ho, ho! Ho! (horse whinnying) - Shit. (pensive music) (cattle lowing) (men yelling) - Guard! Close the gate. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - [Ranch Hand] I got his legs. (man speaks indistinctly) - Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! (calf groaning) All right. (cattle groaning) Move, move. (men chattering) (cattle lowing) (tense pensive music) - Oh, God! Get the pickup! For God's sake, drive! - Okay for tonight. Be better off going home. - I'd be better off right here. - Laura, there'll come a time when you'll need to be with him, but this isn't it. He's just lost consciousness. He's fallen off horses before. - Not very often. I want to stay with him- - Please, please. By morning, he'll be hollering for his boots. Go home. Get some sleep. - He's dying. I can't believe it. (Charley speaking in French) She's coming. - Oh. - I asked here to bring Rene. - Yes, good. Now you go home. I'm staying here. - You sure? Okay, Mom. (vital sign monitor beeping) (Charley breathing rapidly) (dog barking) - You hush! Down. (dog whimpers) (dog barks) - Dad, this is my wife, Adrienne. - I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. McLeod. - Please, you don't have to call me... - This is Rene. (Rene speaking in French) (Charley, Jr. Laughs) - What's he say? - He wants to know if you really are a cowboy. - Oh, tell him I'm his grandpa. (Adrienne speaking in French) (laughs) Little guy. - They grow out of it. - [Adrienne] Oh, maman! - Adrienne! (women laughing) - Well, don't have to tell me who this is. - Adrienne, this here is my- - Brian, just call me Brian, ma'am. And you must be- - Rene. - Oh, hold on now, not kid Rene, fastest draw in France? (laughs) I'll get your bag, ma'am. - Thank you. - [Charley, Sr.] Come say hi to your grandma. - Rene. - Sure fooled me, hoss. Never thought you had a wife on ice as pretty as that. (whistles) - That's when I was in rodeo right after the war. That's Bobby Brennan there. He was the best bulldogger on the circuit. Ended up in the movies, makin' Westerns. He knew Randolph Scott personally. Ah, there was one night I found Bobby stretched out flat on the floor in the lobby of the Pagosa Springs Hotel. He was clawin' the carpet and moanin', "I'm havin' a heart attack!" I got all excited. I was gonna run for the doctor. "No, no," he says. "I have 'em all the time!" (laughs) That's when I noticed the empty bottle of Old Overholt rolled under the settee behind him. (laughs) (Rene speaking in French) What does he say? - He said his grandfather in France was part of the resistance. - Oh, yeah, well, you tell him I was in France too. (Charley, Jr. speaking in French) (Rene speaking in French) - Ah, you are there? - Yeah, I was in tanks. Didn't see much besides iron and mud. (Rene speaks in French) Kept my head down all the way from Normandy to the Alp. Tell him I was scared the whole time. (Charley, Jr. speaking in French) - But you are hero, no? - [Charley, Sr.] No, I got a tiny little medal that didn't mean anything. - Come on, Dad, Bronze Star, World War II, the last good war. It must have meant something. - No war is good. - Really? Well, if you believe that, why you on my case about Vietnam? - Hey, why don't you take this in the dining room and look at it, little britches? Look, I know you're smarter than I am, but we're all of us ignorant, just on different subjects, and one of the subjects I am not ignorant on is war. - Then you know why I left. - No, I just know why I stayed. - My country, right or wrong, is that it? - I guess that's about it. - Well, that was your war. Mine was different. - That's what they keep sayin'. - Why don't you listen to them? - Laura, who were those people in California, when we went to that cattlemen's convention? - [Laura] There were a lot of them, dear! - Yeah, the (indistinct), yeah. We went to this Catholic church. - (sighs) What's that got to do with 55,000 dead Americans? - I'm just tryin' to tell you it wasn't all for nothing. We went in this church, there were all these Asians, little kids and old grandmas, sidin' up to the altar, all those poor boat people. They were alive because we went to Vietnam. - They were the lucky few who managed to get out. The people hated us! Our own government even backed out. - Yeah, that's the by-God truth. They never shoulda sent you if they didn't intend to finish the job. - You sent us, you were the government. - Rene, there's a book in the bottom drawer of the bureau in my bedroom, a big blue book. (Charley, Jr. speaking in French) - So that part is good. We love each other and Rene very much, and now that his photos are selling, things are much easier. - He wasn't selling his photos? You never wrote me about that. - Oh, things were very hard after Rene was born. - Yes, I felt it when I visited that winter. - That winter and several more. But now it is better, except for... - Charley, call him Charley, everybody does. - Charles calls him Dad, except when he's being serious, he calls him "my father." They're very alike, no? - The apple didn't fall too far from the tree. Charles, Jr., he talks about his father, does he? - Yes, why not? You know, he loves his father very much. - Yes, I know. - Then whose policy is it? - Look, there's something I wanna show you. Where's that damn book? Rene! - Dad, calm down, I'll get it. (Charles, Sr. sighs) (Charley, Jr. speaking in French) (Rene speaking in French) (tense pensive music) - Put it back. (horse whinnying) (men tutting) - You like that, huh? (Rene speaks in French) Riding. - Cowboys? - Yeah, that's close enough. You know how to whistle, don't you? (Rene speaks in French) Well, like this. (whistles) Go on. (Rene blows forcefully) (laughs) Well, never mind. You're the carrot man, then. - Carrot. - Muy bien, you're gettin' it, partner. Come on. Now this is a saddle. You got that? - (speaks in French) Saddle. - Yeah, that's it, that's right. See, this is a cinch, stirrup, fender, skirts, pommel, candle. (Rene speaking in French) No. - I want, want to yahoo? - Exactamente, partner. That's the whole idea. All set, go ahead. - Yahoo! - Oh, gotta do better than that. Hee-ya! Ha! - [Rene] Yahoo! (upbeat music) (warm music) - Now, this here is a hot dog. It's a wiener. It's a kinda sausage. Here, you take a bite outta that, you'll start talkin' American. How's that? (Rene speaks in French) Yeah, you bet it's bon. You look over there, you can see the Pacific Ocean. And if you look real hard, like, that way, you can just make out the Atlantic. Clear day, you can see France. - Oh? - Oh, for sure. Did you make her out? - No. (speaks in French) - You don't believe me? I declare, you must be a real McLeod. There's no foolin' you, that's for sure. Give me a bite. - Mornin', Brian. - [Brian] Kenny. - What brings you here, sober and orderly? - Kenny, what do you know about desertion? - (exhales dramatically) Charley's kid? Well, it was a long time ago, and then President Carter pardoned those draft dodgers. - CJ wasn't no draft dodger. He was in uniform. - (scoffs) So was I. I joined the National Guard unit to make sure I'd never see fire. (laughs) - Yeah. Charley, Jr. went AWOL on active duty. Now, did Jimmy Carter mean to let them boys off the hook? - [Charley, Sr.] Now, just sit up there like a passenger. You make it do what you want him to do! Keep your elbows in. - I do! - Yeah. (camera clicks) All right, now, what do you do when you finish your ride? - Make the horse not hot. - That's it. Pull off the saddle, curry him down, give him some water and a flake of hay. All right, cowboy, he's all yours. He'll do. - He's a good boy. - Yeah, I believe it. You know, I called you a quitter that time, but when I saw you up on that hammer-headed (indistinct), bulkiest piece of horseflesh I ever owned. Thought if anybody could ride him, maybe you could do it. - Disappointed you again, huh? I'm sorry, (clears throat) that was uncalled for. - Charley, tell me, please, why'd you do it? Why'd you run away? - You think I was scared, don't you? - Hell yes, I know I was. Under fire, any man who isn't scared's a damn fool, but you stay for your buddies. - For your buddies. I had a buddy, his name was Franklin. He was Big Oaky, I liked him a lot, and I stayed for him. We'd been ordered to take this village on the edge of a jungle. We'd been hammerin' away for hours. Charlie finally just picked up and left. When we got in, there was nothin'. There was no rice, there were no weapons, nothin'. And Franklin and I and the CO were in this hooch when the first rocket hit. Franklin's arm was just blown off, and the CO was hurt pretty bad. Someone was screamin' Charlie was comin' out of the trees. They called in the choppers and carried the CO out to a landing zone. And when I went back to get Franklin, there was a gook standing over him with a knife, tryin' to cut off his boots. I emptied my clip into him so fast, he started spinnin'. And when he dropped, when he dropped, I saw it was a woman. And under arm, in a sack, there was this, there was her baby. And I said to myself, "God, (sighs) "please don't tell me I've killed a baby. "There is no reason to kill a baby." And then his mouth started to open. I saw these bubbles started come out, and they were covered with blood, and they just were comin' out so fast, like that kid's toy with the plastic thing. - Sweet Jesus. - And the next day, our guys came back and took the village. And you know what? A week later, Charlie came back and he took the same damn village. I was in a hole in the middle of nowhere with my best friend dying in my arms, for what? I was killin' women and babies, for what? (sighs) The thing was absurd, the whole damn thing was absurd. - Charley, you swore an oath. - I swore an oath to my country, not to what was goin' on over there! I didn't swear an oath to that! I didn't run away scared. I walked away! And don't think it's been easy to turn my back on my country, 'cause it's been a nightmare. And don't you think it hasn't been hell for me to go against you? (horse whinnying) (boards clattering) (energetic music) - Ride him, cowboy! (indistinct) (Homer laughs) Ride him! (Homer hooting) (laughs) Firm in the belly! (laughs) Look, look! Get him. (Homer yelling indistinctly) (Homer laughs) (Homer hooting) (horse whinnies) - [Charley, Jr.] Whoa. (Charley, Jr. yells) (horse whinnying) (Charley, Jr. groans) - [Homer] Come on! (warm pensive music) - [Charley, Jr.] Damn. - His leg's broke. - Bring my rifle. My, he could run. (Charley, Jr. panting) My horse. - It's my responsibility. (gun cocks) (gun fires) - They are good, Charles. Do you think you will do anything with them? - I don't know. - Maybe one of the magazines in Paris. - Why, American in Paris down on the farm? You should get back, you know? - Okay. (speaks in French) - I don't know what I'm tryin' to prove here. - Why do you have to prove anything? Why can't you just enjoy the time you have left together? - 'Cause he's not gonna let me. He just keeps it hanging out there, like barbed wire between us. - You have endured before. You will now. Look, this bronco. He is tough like you. Come on, Charley. - Oh, no. - Oh, be my cowboy. - No, no (speaks in French). (Charley speaks in French) (Adrienne speaks in French) - (squeals) No! (Charley speaks in French) (laughs) No, no! - [Charley] Cowboy? (Adrienne speaks in French) (muffled chattering over radio) (dog barking) - You, you, quiet down. Quiet down. Ken Range, you old pole cat! Come on in. I'll fix you a drink. - No, really, I'm on duty. - Oh, to hell with that. Laura! - I've come to arrest Charles Wesley MacLeod, Jr. (Charley, Jr. speaks in French) - Okay, let's go. - Hold on. - No, not in my house. - I'm sorry, sir, it's procedure. - It's fine, it's fine, I'm okay. (tense pensive music) (handcuffs clicking) (muffled chattering over radio) - [Rene] Papa, Papa! - Rene! (Rene speaking French) Rene! Rene. (tense pensive music) (dog barking) - You got no idea what it took to go against your old man. Now, at one time- - Yeah, I know, a man might have gotten shot for arresting a MacLeod. - The FBI man in Cheyenne said they was through dealin' with deserters. U.S. Attorney's office didn't know what to do with you. Finally got this AWOL apprehension team. Took 'em a day to call back if you were in their computer. I'm not even sure it's my jurisdiction. - But you have this driving sense of civic duty, huh? (sighs) Lucky me. (ranch hand speaks indistinctly) - [Ranch Hand] Not too loud, I got a hangover. - Move! - Here's your water. - Ah. (Brian groans) - Brian. - Yeah. - You turned him in, didn't you? - He's a finch, Charley, me, to you, to Daddy, God rest his soul, to every man who carried a rifle, no matter what Godforsaken war they was in. - Don't make me choose between you two any more than I already have. - You Charles W. MacLeod, Jr., specialist four, U.S. Army? - That's right. - You might consider signing this. - What is this? - Enlisted out, chapter 10, AR 635-200. You get to choose. I can take you back to the fort, I'll put you in the stockade for a couple of weeks while you wait your court martial. You could probably fight it with a good lawyer. - Or? - You can fill out your name and your social security number, and hereby voluntarily request discharge for the good of the service. You admit that you have broken the uniform code of military justice. You circle AWOL. I take it back to the CO. That gives us an administrative way of getting you out of our hair. (drums rapping) What you get is an other-than-honorable discharge. There's no publicity, there's no trial. - You got a pen? (warm pensive music) - Are you coming in? - I believe I'll take a little walk. You get him. - Well, I could use a drink. How 'bout you? - I guess not. - We'll be at the City Cafe. - It ain't right to give that traitor a slap on his fancy French wrist. I ain't the only one in town who thinks so either. - That's right. (bright energetic music) - Hey, Charley, Jr. How you doin'? - I'd like you to meet my wife. This is Adrienne. This is Nell. - I'm pleased to meet you. - I'm pleased to meet you too. What can I get for ya? - How 'bout a red wine and a beer? - Jim. ♪ Out of a mountain ♪ ♪ Baby, don't make a molehill ♪ ♪ Out of a mountain ♪ ♪ Don't make a molehill ♪ - There ain't no tour bus today, so you tell him to drink up fast and get out. - It's on the house. - You ever feel like frog giggin'?

(tense music) - I'm not a pacifist. (Brian yells) (Charley groans) (glass shattering) (Adrienne screams) - [Man] Get him, Brian! (kick thuds) - Brian. - [Man] Hey, hold it, hold it. (men yelling) (Charley grunts) - No! No! - Hey, Charley, Jr.'s gettin' it. (men grunting) (punch thudding) - [Man] Fighter here. (punches thudding) Yeah, come on, yeah!

(tense music) (men yelling) (gun fires) - You lay another hand on him and I'll kill you. - He's a damn deserter, Charley, and you know it. (gun cocks) (dog barking) (metal clanging) - When you worked for me those summers when you were a kid, I thought, "He's a good hand." You kept it up when you were grown, I'll give you that. You're a good hand. I almost gave you part of this outfit. I was damn foolish. - Charley- - Wait. That's more than fair severance there. - I deserve better. - So did I. (Brian sighs) (rooster clucking) - Where you want this, Charley? - Just put it there. - What are you doing? - I'm takin' advantage! - You let me go, Charley MacLeod! (laughs) This isn't the time or the place. - Well, when is? - Guess there never is. (laughs) Oh. Sometimes, when you take in all this beauty, you think they're always. - Remember that first spring when you went to the roundup? - What I remember is the first winter, that blizzard. - You were just accustomed to that California weather. You got used to things pretty fast. Remember in that roundup, you said you'd do anything, (laughs) even ride drag. - I never got used to it. Barn's not 50 yards from the house, and everything was dead quiet just past the porch. And you stepped into the snow. - Oh, I knew where the barn was. - You disappeared, like you were swallowed whole. I didn't think you'd come back. - Well, I did. - (scoffs) You know, before I said "Yes, I'll marry you," I read about those ranchers who just up and disappeared into the snow. And then during the first thaw, they were found not 20 yards from the house. - What a thing for a young bride to think. - How could I not? I loved you so. Well, it was worth it. - Yeah, it was. - I'm not a bride anymore. - Oh. You'll do. - But you won't. I've never stood up to you before. - You have too. - Not about some important things, things so important that I was afraid of losing you. But it's gonna happen now anyway, so now I'm gonna stand up. If you love someone, you risk an awful lot. You risk losing them, or you risk losing your right to be proud and hurt. To love someone, you have to be able to forgive. I've been forgiving you for 15 years that I don't have my one son nearby. Now it's your turn. - I don't know what to do. - You don't do anything. You just wake up and die right, Charley MacLeod. - I wanna go home. - If that is what you want, Charles, we will go home. - Why, what do you want? - I want no more anger, no more distance. - (groans) Listen. We have to get back to our lives. We can't just camp here waiting for him to die. - Don't leave it this way, please. (knocking on door) - [Laura] May I come in? - No. - Your father wants to talk to you. - About what? - He wants to forgive you. - Okay, but I haven't done anything wrong. - Young man, unless you are the second coming of Christ, you've done something wrong, so you march out to that stable this instant! And on the way, get ready to forgive him. (warm music) - You walk him down by the corral for a minute. I'll be right with you. - Mom said you wanted to speak to me. (tense pensive music) Dad, let's just agree to disagree. - Oh, I'm tired of that. (warm music) Charley, why did you come back home? - Mom thought there was a chance of peace between us. - I know what your mother thought. Why'd you come back? - Because you're going to die, and I needed to tell you that I love you. - Never shoulda left home. (Charley, Jr. scoffs) (sighs) I guess you better help me on this fool horse, see if it'll pony. (warm music swells) Hey, Charley. - Are you okay? Let me. Are you sure you should ride? - Lord, it comes and it goes. Don't bury me yet. (warm music) (soft warm music)
