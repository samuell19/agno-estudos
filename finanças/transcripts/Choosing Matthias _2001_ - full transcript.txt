(film reel spinning) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (car engine revving) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (car engine revving) - [Maggie] So what do you wanna do when we do San Francisco? - [Jason] Baseball game. - Baseball game? Oh, that sounds great. But I don't think we're gonna have enough time this trip. - How about a movie? - Yeah, a movie. - Well, you know, we could see a couple movies, if you want. - Two movies? - Maybe one, 'cause they're really long. - Okay. - [Maggie] So why don't we play a game? Our state game, capital game. - Okay. - Ready? - [Charlie] California. - [Jason] Sacramento. - Texas. - Austin. (car engine revving) - Washington. - Olympia. - You're so smart. (gentle music) (car engine revving) (gentle music) - [Charlie] We're almost there. (gentle music) - Almost there. Are you hungry? Are you hungry? - [Charlie] All right. (gentle music) (car engines revving) (gentle music) (tram engine revving) - Okay. Look at all the neat stuff. - Wow. - Wow is right. - Oh honey, please don't touch that. - Come here, sweetie. Hi. - Hi. - I'm Maggie. - Hi Maggie. - And this is Charlie. - Hi. - Hi. - And this is our son, Jason. - Hi, Jason. - Hello. - So you made it okay? - Yeah. - Kay gave you good directions? - Oh yeah. - Great. - Good. Come on this way. As you can see, we specialize in many different kinds of art. This painting right here, it's called, "After Birth." Makes you think twice about having children. (both laughing) - Whoa. - Her last printing, "Embryo" sold for 20,000. (gentle music) - Well, if you like that, you're gonna love his things. - Okay, well, let's see what you got. - Dad says you probably won't buy anything. He says that all gallery owners are the same. - Oh, he did? - [Maggie] No, he didn't say that. - Yes, he did. - Okay, all right honey, you go look at some of the other art stuff and don't touch anything. And we'll be there in just a second. - This is nice. - [Maggie] It's great, isn't it? - It's so dynamic. Yet you feel this sense of serenity. - I know. (door bell buzzing) - Oh, will you just excuse me for one moment? - Sure. - Chase, it is so good to see you. How have you been? - I'm great. How you doing? - Good, where have you been? - Where have I been, where haven't I been? - I don't know. - I was in Milan. I found this fabulous artist in Antibes, South of France. He's wonderful. He does these sort of hieroglyphic etchings in stone. It's very earthy. I enjoy it. - What are you gonna do now? - I'm looking for, you know. What's that? - It's this kid artist I found in Brazil. What do you think? - I hate it. - Yeah, so do I. - I'm looking for something sort of dark, visceral, edgy, subversive, you know. - You know what, I think I have something for you. - You think? 'Cause everything is so trendy. What are people saying? They've been trying to make statements. - I don't know. - What are they trying to say? Why say it? Drop the piece. Move on. - You're so right. - 'Cause it's a bore. It's all been done, it's all derivative. Everything is completely, you know, passionless and boring. Are you the artist? - Yes. (gentle music) - And you are? - Charlie. (gentle music) - Charles. Charles. (gentle music) You, can say it. - Charles. - It's beautiful. (gentle music) - Dylan. - Charles Dylan. (gentle music) - Dylan. (gentle music) Drop the Charles, I can work with that. I was in Yugoslavia. It was a fabulous artist. - It's good. - No it's not. - It's is. - No, I don't think it is. No, I don't think he likes it. - He does like your name, Charles. He wouldn't have said that. You're great. You're great, he's gonna see that. Yes he is. (both laughing) (gentle music) Well, what did he say? - He wants to take it all. - Oh. Did you hear that? He wants to take all of 'em? - He hasn't. - He only saw two pieces. - He doesn't care. (Maggie laughing) - I told you you were great. Oh my goodness. (Maggie laughing) - [Jason] Come on guys. - Okay. Oh gosh. Can you believe it? You are amazing. - Okay. - Great job, Dad. - Oh, thank you, buddy. - So what are we gonna do to celebrate? - How about a movie night? - A movie, yeah. - With pizza. - Pizza. - Pizza and a movie. - Lots of pizza. - Okay. - The contract. - Oh my gosh, I left it. No, no, no, I'll go get it. You pick a movie, I'll be right back. - So how much money did you get, Dad? - $84,000. - Wow. - Yeah. And I'm gonna buy you all the pizza in the world. - No you're not. - Yes I am buddy. Let's go get a newspaper. - Okay. - Susan. (gentle music) (car horns honking) (car brakes screeching) - [Charlie] Jason. (dramatic music) - [Bystander] Don't move him. (dramatic music) (car horns honking) - Charlie. - Honey, is Jason with you? - No, he's not with me. He's not with you? - I got turned. - Oh honey, oh Charlie. Jason. (dramatic music) Jason. Have you seen a little boy? A little boy. - [Charlie] Jason. - A little boy, no? Jason, Jason. Oh God, oh my God. A little boy, have you seen little boy? (dramatic music) No, no? Oh my God. A little boy, a little boy. (dramatic music) - Yeah. - Jason. Jason. Oh my God. Oh my God. Jason. Oh my God. Jason. Jason. Oh God. Jason. Jason. (gentle music) Jason. Oh my God. Oh my God. Jason. Oh my God. Jason. (gentle music) Jason. (insects chirping) (car horns honking) (gentle music) (telephone ringing) - [Charlie] Hello. Have you found him? (gentle music) (Charlie crying) They. - No, no. (gentle music) Charlie. Charlie, don't you say anything. (gentle music) No, no, no. Everything is fine. Now we're gonna find him. We're gonna find him, we're gonna take him home. This city is huge. There are so many buildings just like this that we haven't looked through. And we're gonna find him. He is out there and he is alone, and he's scared, but we're gonna find him, we're gonna find him. And it's gonna be okay. (gentle music) - Mr. and Mrs. Dylan, thank you for getting down here so promptly. I know this isn't easy, but it's necessary procedure. We found his body in a shallow grave, not too far outside the city. He wasn't wearing the clothes you described. And there's some severe bruising and decay. When we go inside, his body will be covered with the sheet. The coroner will pull away the sheet until enough of this face is revealed in order to make a positive identification. And if at any time you feel uncomfortable, please let me know and we'll stop. (gentle music) (Charlie crying) (gentle music) (Maggie crying) - Oh no. No. No, no. (Maggie crying) - Maggie. - No. (upbeat music) (birds chirping) (upbeat music) (truck engine revving) (upbeat music) (truck engine revving) (upbeat music) (truck engine revving) (upbeat music) (birds chirping) (upbeat music) (whistling) (upbeat music) (birds chirping) (door knocking) - Hey, J&S delivery. (birds chirping) - Bring it in. - Where should I put it, Picasso? (Alex laughing) - Alex. - How you doing, boy? - Okay. (both laughing) God, it's been a long time. - Two years, three months and four days, to be exact. - See you haven't about the beer. - Yeah, you know me. (Alex laughing) - I traded 'em in for water. - Oh, well, better you than me. - Man it's good to see you. - Good to see you too. They've had me back at the warehouse shuffling paperwork for the last couple of years. Do you believe it? Oh man. How are you guys doing? - Oh, we're doing great. Yeah, everything's great. You want something to eat? - No, just time for a quick beer. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) - [Alex] It's good to see you guys doing so well. - Yeah. How long's Frank gonna be out? - Oh, a couple more weeks. His wife's due any day now. Oh man. Oh, this is gonna cost me. - Oh, don't worry about that. I'll take care of that. - But it's not your responsibility. - No, no, I'll tell you what. Look, I just add 30 bucks to the bill. That should cover everything. - You sure, Picasso? - Oh yeah. (birds chirping) There you go. - Hey, thanks man. - You're welcome. Good to see you. - Good to see you too, man. (truck engine revving) (birds chirping) (gentle music) - Hey Mags. - Charlie, I wish she wouldn't call me that. Sounds like rags, you know. - Okay. - What's that? - What? - Charlie, you been drinking? - No, that's not mine. I'll put it away. - Oh. - Yeah. That's my fault, I picked up the wrong filters. I'll pick some more up on my way back from Ms. Leonard's. - The little things Charlie, you know. - Yeah, you're right, it's the little things. - Charlie, I think that he overcharged us. - No, there were a few things missing. So I just covered it. - Charlie, we can't afford this. - I know Maggie. Ms. Leonard and I, we're talking about this. We're making progress. I wish you would come with me today. - I can't. - Please. - I can't. (birds chirping) (car engines revving) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) - Hey there. How you doing? Did you lose something? Well, you gonna catch a death of a cold standing there and getting ready to get the courage up to jump in that water. Now I admire courage, but I think you ought to get down right now and put on your pants boy, before you catch a cold. Ain't you freezing? (birds chirping) I don't know about you, but when I was a kid, going skinny dipping didn't mean wearing in the boxer shorts. Now of course, times have changed, I realize that. But when you skinny dip in water this cold, you are gonna get some awfully big bumps. - Doc. Who are you talking to? - Maggie. (Doc laughing) Oh. - Hey. - [Doc] How are you? - [Maggie] I'm good. - [Doc] Let me look at you. You look beautiful. - [Maggie] Thank you. - You're a sight for sore eyes. - When did you get here? - I got in late last night. Drove up here this morning. You know me, I'm not gonna miss a fishing tournament. Well, how's that old man here treating you? - Good. - Ain't gonna find nobody better than him, Maggie. - So, good to get outta the big city? - Oh yeah. Yeah, I like to come up here and clear my head, take stock. You know, I don't know what it is, but for some reason when I'm casting that line now, I always seem to come up with the right answers. - What's the question, Doc? (birds chirping) - The question is different for everybody, Maggie. Look up from everybody. - Gosh, I've missed you. - I missed you too. Well, listen, I see my spots clear over there, so I'm gonna go to the car and get my equipment and I'll come up and see you and Charlie later. - Okay. Glad you're back. - [Doc] Thanks Maggie. (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) - "Be silent in that solitude, "which is not loneliness. "For then the spirits of the dead "who stood in life before thee "are again in death around thee, "and the will shall overshadow thee. "Be still." (birds chirping) How is it Poe that you always seem to know my thoughts? (gentle music) (birds chirping) - Hey Maggie. (birds chirping) (cabinet banging) (birds chirping) - Hey there. Hey you guys. - How you doing? - I'm good. How are you? - Hey Maggie. - How do you feel? - Oh, I'm pregnant. (all laughing) - You look pregnant. - Yeah, I feel it. I tell you, every time I get to this point, I vow and never have another one. - Yeah, but we sure have fun making them, don't we, honey? - Yeah, you see what my problem is? - I see. (all laughing) - So are you gonna enter the fishing tournament? - No, I don't think we're gonna enter this year. - No? - That's good for us, maybe we'll have a chance at first place, for a change. - [Kay] Yeah, like I'm gonna fish this year. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey Charlie. - How you doing? - All right. - Do what's a candy? - Dad? - Dad? - [Ron] Okay. - [Kay] Don't spoil your dinner, okay. - Hey, how about some, I know you like donuts, have some donuts. You wanna roll up? - [Kid] Mom, look, Mom. - Yeah, that's fine. Just eat 'em outside, okay honey. - Can we play with your new son? - Charlie, I told you this is getting way outta hand. You know he is not gonna be able to stay. (car engines revving) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) - Hey girls, let's go after him, huh. Come on, go outside. (birds chirping) Lift you up, oh, big old door. Let's go find Matthias. Hey Charlie, wait up, bringing the posse. (birds chirping) Me too. - I'm sorry you had to see that. - See what? We didn't see anything, did with kids? Why don't you guys go find Matthias, okay. See you later. - Charlie won't give up. You know, he just won't give up. - What is going on? - I don't know, Kay. I swear, I feel like I am holding on by a tiny thread and that any minute it is just going to snap. (birds chirping) - You know, I see what you're doing. And for what it's worth, I just wanna say it takes a lot of guts. (birds chirping) You know, you and you and Maggie will be all right. You guys are gonna make it. (birds chirping) Just remember that there's a chance, good chance, it could get even worse before it gets better, you know. (birds chirping) Just hang in here. - I don't understand. I thought this whole thing with Matthias was okay with you. - No, no, it was never really okay with me to bring him here. - Well, why did you? - Because I just felt like Charlie was pressuring me. And then out of the blue, I get this phone call, you know about a kid who needs a home for a while and everybody is so sure that I have a home who needs a kid. - You know, Charlie means well. - Why is it that everybody seems to get Charlie, but nobody seems to understand me at all? - Oh, Maggie, it's just temporary. - It's been four weeks already. It is obvious that Charlie is just getting so attached and he just expects me to fall in love with this little boy. - Would that be so bad? (gentle music) Maggie, that little boy's gone through so much. And he just needs a place to stay until they find him a a permanent home. I know you, Maggie, you've got a big heart, you can do this. - Kay, you don't know what I can and can't do now. You just don't understand. You still have your family. (gentle music) (insects chirping) - Charlie. - Mags. I just wanna say, I'm sorry. I don't think I've been fair lately. (insects chirping) - It's just that there is so much that is going on inside, Charlie. (gentle music) (insects chirping) (gentle music) - Talk to me, Maggie. (gentle music) - I want to. (gentle music) - Maggie. - I can't. I just can't. (gentle music) - How long do you think this can go on? Truly, please. (gentle music) In the meantime, we've invited Matthias into our home. The least you can do is try to make him feel comfortable. He's just a child. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) - Coffee's good. Got the right filters. - Yep. (birds chirping) - Good morning, Matthias. - Hey champ. How'd you sleep? - Okay. - That's good. - [Matthias] Hey Charlie. - Yeah? - How much would something like this cost? - Oh well, some of 'em can get pretty pricey. Depends on how much a man is willing to spend, what his needs are. - What kind of fishing you planning on doing? - I don't know, just regular fishing, I guess. What other kind is there? - Oh gosh, there's fly fishing, there's deep sea fishing. - Well, what is this used for? - Well, that might be a little more than you need if say you were gonna just do some fresh water fishing around here. (birds chirping) But I have something I think will work. (car engine revving) - What's this for? - When I was a little girl, I used to fish with a paperclip, a string and a stick. - A paperclip? Did you ever catch anything? - Did she ever catch anything, are you kidding me? Look at all those trophies up on the wall. You're talking to Hidden Springs champion, six years in a row. - You won all those? - Oh, well Charlie won a few of 'em. - Just the small ones. (Matthias laughing) - And a lot of 'em are my Dad's. See, he used to run this store and people used to come from all over just to sit here and talk to him about fishing. (birds chirping) - Maggie, why don't you show Matthias how to make one of your special fishing poles? - Okay, I will. (birds chirping) Come with me. Okay, so you just tie a knot right there, okay. Pull it way back here. Put your finger there. And then you just start wrapping. (car engines revving) Wrap it 'till you get it as long as you want your line to be. - Okay. (gentle music) - Then you take your paperclip, twist it like it's a hook. (gentle music) Take the end of your string. (gentle music) Stick it right through the hole. (gentle music) And tie another knot. And, fishing pole. - Thanks. Can I go to the lake? - Okay, don't stay too long. - Okay. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle upbeat music) (birds chirping) (gentle upbeat music) Hello. Is anybody in here? (gentle music) (birds chirping) - [Doc] Hey, you gonna scare the fish away. What happened to you yesterday? - What do you mean? - Well, I mean, you were here one minute and gone the next. You weren't all shy about that lady, were you? 'Cause you don't have to worry about her. She doesn't care. - You know her? - Yeah. I've known Maggie ever since she was a little girl. In fact, she's just about your age. She's a good fisherman, even back then. Maggie's a good woman. (birds chirping) You hungry? - Sorta. - Well, ham and cheese or peanut butter and jelly? - Peanut butter and jelly. - There you go, that's the one I would've taken. Well come over here to get it, I ain't coming over there. (birds chirping) There you go. My friends call me Doc. What's yours? - Matthias. - Matthias. Oh, that's a good name. Sandwich good? (birds chirping) Well, peanut butter's not sticking to the roof of your mouth, is it? - No. - I hate that. Don't you? (birds chirping) First time fishing? - Yeah. - I remember my first fishing pole was a stick and a string. Won't find them any better. - I guess they're good for the little fish. I can't catch big fish with them though. The stick will probably break. - Well, I wouldn't worry about it if I were you. - Why not? - Big fish don't like bubble gum. (birds chirping) All right, all right. Come on over here. I'll show you how to do it. (birds chirping) All right. First thing you gotta do is get rid of this bubble gum. - Well then it's good, it's good that he? - Of course. - It just, it kind of threw me off. - Oh, it was wonderful, what you did was perfect, 'cause you just stayed there and you listened to him. - Are you saying that the anger's good? - It's great that he got mad. He let out his real feelings and probably for one of the few times in his life, somebody didn't walk away from him. It was a very, very positive. Oh, hi Maggie. - Hi, how are you? - [Mrs. Leonard] I'm fine, how are you? - Good. - I'm just telling Charlie how pleased I was with the session yesterday. I think Matthias took some big steps. - Good. Good. - Yeah, we're connecting. - Good. Good, I'm glad. - It's real good. - And I was hoping that you'd be joining us in therapy soon. - Well, I hope I can, but one of us, you know, has to be in the store. - Yeah, when I go, she has to stay here. But she wants to, she wants to. - I know, I know that you're busy, I know. - Maybe next time you can go and I'll stay. - I hope so. (birds chirping) (car engine revving) - So, is everybody getting along all right, and? - Good. - I'm glad to hear that. You know, I don't know what took me so long. When I finally thought about you two, I knew Matthias would be welcomed here and that he'd fit right in. - But you're still looking for a permanent home for him though, right? (birds chirping) - Yes. Actually, I was hoping that you'd be taking him in permanently. (birds chirping) - Well, we're talking about it, we. - We're talking. - Yeah, and in a good way, I mean. - Good, because you know, Matthias has already been with three other foster families. And I hate to see him keep getting moved from home to home, you know, he's been through so much already. - Well, they told us that his father left and his mom died in the fire. But isn't there anyone else, I mean, doesn't he have family? - No, no, there aren't. And his father abandoned him when he was six. And his mother couldn't handle it, so he got passed from foster home to foster home. And then she finally took him back in a year ago. - I don't understand. They told us that he was with a foster family when his mother died. - Oh, no, no he was in the house the night of the fire. And they got Matthias out okay. But he saw that they couldn't save his mother. (birds chirping) So I just, you know, I thought he was a perfect match for you two. And here he would have a safe, stable environment. - Yeah. (birds chirping) How about if I call you tomorrow and we can set up an appointment? - That's a great idea. Thanks Charlie. And I hope to see you soon, Maggie. - Nice to see you. - All right, be careful driving down the mountain. - Bye, bye. - Thanks, bye. - Bye. I'll call you. - Okay. (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) - Of course, now you know that fishing ain't just about fishing. Oh no. Fishing is sitting, you know, quietly and thinking. (birds chirping) Okay? - Okay. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) - I just don't see how it's all right for him to just lock himself off for hours. (insects chirping) He hasn't sold anything since Jason. And how could he keep doing the one thing that probably caused Jason to get taken? - You don't really think that, do you? - Yes, I do Kay, I do. I think that we got so caught up in the idea of Charlie's success that we just missed it somehow. (insects chirping) And I think maybe God is punishing us for being so selfish. - You can't blame yourself. And God would never harm Jason to teach you a lesson, you know that. - Then why, Kay, why? Charlie got angry, you know, he got mad, he got mad at God. But somehow he got over it. The thing that keeps haunting me, that thing that I just can't get past is the why. Why me? Why my family? Why my baby, huh? - You never gonna know why. You can ask yourself why a thousand times and there will never be a reason good enough. (insects chirping) There are just some things that we'll never understand. (insects chirping) The question that you have to ask yourself is, are you gonna start living the life that you have left? Or are you just gonna shut yourself off in this little world that you've created with your diary in your books? (insects chirping) Maggie, I know I can't begin to understand what you've gone through, but, when you go to that place that you go to on your mountain, stop reading those morbid stories and just pray. (Maggie laughing) Or meditate or just talk to God. (insects chirping) You'll find your heart again. - Don't you get it, Kay? I don't want my heart again. I buried my heart two years ago when I buried my baby and I don't want it back. I took everything, all of his stuff, I took his birth announcements, the little drawings he made for me, and I buried him up on that mountain. And I put my heart right in there with those memories. And I don't want it back. (gentle music) I can't take the responsibility of another baby. (Maggie crying) I failed already. (gentle music) - You didn't fail. And your heart isn't dead. (gentle music) It's just broken. (gentle music) But broken hearts can heal. You're gonna just have to trust me on that one. (gentle music) - You know what? I can honestly tell you that I hope that you're wrong. - Maggie, Maggie, if you don't let it go, if you don't at least try to start to heal, then you just might lose Charlie too. (gentle music) (grinder motor revving) (gentle music) (door knocking) - Hey buddy, ready for bed? Pretty big day today, you must be tired, huh? - [Matthias] Not really. - No? Well, I remember the days when I was never tired. At least I never admitted to anyone. Can I come in, just for a minute? (insects chirping) Matthias, remember what we talked to Mrs. Leonard about, stealing and trust and how it's good to let people help you? Can I ask you a question? Are you afraid that maybe Maggie and I, we can't take care of you? Because you really don't have to be afraid. - I'm not afraid. I can take care of myself. - I know you can, buddy. Well, it was nice talking to you. Why don't you get some sleep? (gentle music) (insects chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (car engines revving) - I didn't hear you come in last night. - Worked late. - Are you going fishing? - Yep. - Well, I was gonna go hiking. I mean, one of us has to watch the store. - We'll just have to close for the afternoon. - Charlie, we can't do that. - Yes we can. (car engine revving) I'm going fishing, Maggie. Remember all the dreams used to have and all this was only gonna be temporary because you said I was such a great artist, we could live off my sculptures. I loved when you talked like that. But now you do is say things that hurt me and I don't like that. I don't wanna be hurt anymore, Maggie. So I'm gonna take that little boy fishing. And I suggest you go for a walk and think about all those dreams we used to have. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (car engine revving) (gentle upbeat music) Hey, Doc. - Charlie. (all laughing) - How are you, boy? It's good to see you. You're looking great. (birds chirping) - Oh, thanks. You're up here about a month early this year, huh? - Well, I just had a feeling the fish were biting. - Oh, this is Matthias, he's staying with us. - Oh, Charlie, I already met Doc. - When? - Oh, when Maggie let me come up here yesterday. - Oh, that's right, yeah. He and I went out yesterday just chewing the fat, you know, talking men talk. Well, by the way, I had your pole from yesterday, but I see you a little more sophisticated today. - Yeah, Charlie gave it to me. - Well, are we just going to stand here or we gonna do some fishing? - I think we're gonna do some fishing. - All right then let's fish. - Okay. - First thing I'm gonna show you how to bait a hook. - [Matthias] Okay? - [Charlie] Take the worm. - [Matthias] That's fake. - Yeah, it is. I have my own secret little weapon. (birds chirping) - Oh, it stinks. - Yeah. But it smells good to the fish. It's mineral oil and anis. So take the worm, put it through the hook, once, twice, three times. Put a few drops on. It'll make the worm look nice and shiny and smell like lunch. Okay, now for casting, okay. - Okay. - All in the wrist. It's all in the wrists. Nice and easy, nice and smooth, okay. You take your pole and press this here, okay. - Okay. - And when you get to about there, you release. - Okay. - Okay, let's see. (birds chirping) - Wow, that was nice. - You like that? - Yeah. - Okay, let me reel in it and you give it a try. - Okay. - How'd you like that, Doc? - Ah, not bad. I've seen better, but not bad. - Okay. There you go. - So you press the button. - Right, now release when you're about here. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) - Looks to me like he's outcasting you already, Charlie. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) - That's pretty good. Okay, so you know what we do now? - You just sit and wait for the fish to bite. - That's right. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) - You know what, I like it here. - Well, we like having you here. - I'm not gonna be able to stay, am I? - Well, I can tell you this buddy, I'm working real hard on it. - You mean, you're working real hard on Maggie, right? - What do you mean by that? - She hates me. - No she doesn't. Why do you say that? You know Matthias, me and Maggie, we used to have a little boy. - I know. Taylor told me he got kidnapped. Isn't that right? (birds chirping) - Yeah, that's what happened. (gentle music) And it's been real hard since that happened, real hard for Maggie. And things have never really been the same around here. Not until you came. (gentle music) (birds chirping) Mathias, I want to tell you that you're a very special young man, very special. And whatever Maggie is going through and however bad she feels, it's not because of you, it isn't. So, things will work out. - No, they won't. I know the routine, it never works out. (gentle music) - I'll tell you what, you can just be yourself and I guarantee you everything is gonna be just fine. (gentle music) All right. Deal? - Okay, deal. - Okay buddy, let's go home.

(gentle music) You're okay. (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) - Charlie. - Yeah. - Have you entered the fishing tournament yet? - No, Doc, I don't have a partner. (birds chirping) - You don't have a partner and the fishing tournament's tomorrow? You don't have a partner, means you can't fish. - Yeah, I know. - Dang. - What am I gonna do? - Well, it's a last minute thing here. I mean, this is pretty important. - What about old man Perkins, he's pretty good fisherman? - Nah, old man Perkins couldn't catch a fish if it was on his plate. (all laughing) No, we gotta get you somebody that's enthusiastic, really loves fishing much as we do. - Oh, I don't know. Who could that be? (birds chirping) (gentle music) - What about Matthias here? - [Charlie] Matthias? - [Doc] Yeah. I mean I've been teaching him, he's learning. He's fast, he's athletic. - I don't know, he's pretty new at this fishing. - Well Charlie, I think I can do it. I mean, I'm doing pretty good and Doc showed me everything I need to know. He says that it's not a bad experience, but a supple wrist and a keen eye for the ripples in the water. (gentle music) - He taught you all that? (gentle music) - Yep. - I'll tell you one thing, this kid's a natural. (gentle music) - Yeah, Charlie, I think we can win. - Well, it's not about winning or losing. - He's right about that. You know what it's about? It's about having fun. - Well, I think I can do that. (all laughing) - I think you can. - So how about it, Charlie, we got a deal? - Yep, we got a deal. (gentle music) - Okay. (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (people speaking indistinctly) (upbeat music) - Hey kiddo, wait, wait, wait. Where you off to so fast? - I'm going to the fishing tournament with Charlie today. - Okay, well then you've gotta have a big breakfast. So I made you one. I made you muffins, pancakes, cereal, 'cause I know you like cereal, bacon. You like this kind stuff, huh? - Yeah. - Okay, good. Well you sit down and I'll get you some orange juice. You like orange juice? - Yeah. - Yeah. Okay. So you gonna win? - Maybe. But its okay if we don't. Charlie said it's all about having fun. - Well, Charlie's right. But you know what? I have something I think might help. I'll be right back. You go ahead and eat. (birds chirping) Well here it is. What do you think? - That's the ugliest thing I've ever seen. - You are absolutely right. But I tell you, I won like six tournaments in a row with that hat. My grandfather gave it to me when I was about your age. He told me that a really good fishing hat would make you one with the lake. - How's that? - Well, when you wear it, it's so ugly that nobody else will hang around you. So you're the only one on the lake. One with the lake. (both laughing) You get it? It's bad, I know. - Well thanks. I'll give it back after the tournament. - No. Somebody should get some use out of it. You keep it. It's yours. (birds chirping) - [Charlie] Matthias. - Go ahead, don't keep Charlie waiting. (birds chirping) Go. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (upbeat music) - Right here. - Charlie, why aren't we fishing by everybody else? - Well, this is my secret spot, nobody knows about it. This is where all the big ones swim. - So, right here? - Yeah, right here is good. (gentle music) (birds chirping) Okay. So what do we do first? - First, put on our lucky hat. (birds chirping) - Where'd you get that? - Maggie gave it to me this morning. (gentle music) Yep. (birds chirping) - Looks great. (upbeat music) - Good job, good job. What do you think of that? - Congratulations, you still got it in you, baby. - Well, it's in the genes. - I think it's the fish. - I know. - Yeah. - I don't know whether that's a tournament winner or not. But. - That's a nice size. - I'm pretty proud of it. - Yeah. - You did good. - You know the capitals of all the states? - Why do you ask that? - 'Cause I do. - You do? - Aha, ask me. (gentle music) (birds chirping) - New York. - Albany. - Colorado. - Denver. Georgia. - Atlanta. - Yeah. (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) - Mississippi. - I don't know. (both laughing) (upbeat music) (people speaking indistinctly) (upbeat music) I think I got one. - Oh yeah. (both laughing) (upbeat music) - Is this the winning fish? - Yes, this is a winning fish. (all cheering) - Good job. (all cheering) - Thank you boy. Yeah. - [Charlie] Could you hear that guy on the other side of the lake, when he was singing? - [Matthias] Yeah. - [Charlie] You can hear that? - Yeah. And then, And then he got all mad because. - I don't think he was mad. I think he was just pretending. - Really? - Yeah. How about the guy who almost fell in? - Yeah. That huge fish. God. (gentle music) - Charlie should be how many minute. Let us talk and we'll call you back, okay? Okay, thanks. (gentle music) - [Matthias] It was pretty big, huh? - [Charlie] I think it was probably about 30 pounds. - [Matthias] Yeah. - [Charlie] Hello. - Hey, you two. Did you have fun? - Yeah. - Oh yeah. - Okay, tell me, did you win? - [Matthias] No. We got 10th place. - Yeah, we could have won, but somebody let the big one go. - Hey, it's okay. We'll get 'em next year. - Yeah. - Okay. Well you run upstairs and change clothes okay. - Okay. - Okay. - Thanks. - Thanks for being my partner. - Oh, you bet. (gentle music) - Mrs. Leonard just called. She wants to come by tomorrow night and pick up Matthias and take him to San Francisco. They think they found a permanent home there for him. - No, no, no, Maggie, no, I can't let 'em do that. - Charlie, I don't want. - I know, I know you don't want Matthias. - Charlie, you don't understand. - I said I don't understand. You don't understand. I want Matthias and I don't care what you want anymore, Maggie. Don't you understand that Jason is gone. He's not coming back. There's nothing we can do about that. We lost Jason. He lost his whole family. If he'd just would've taken the time to get to know him, Maggie, you would've understood what a beautiful kid he is. We had a second chance, Maggie. And you blew it.

(birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) - [Matthias Voiceover] I thought you were my mom. - [Maggie Voiceover] I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry your mom isn't here. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) - Maggie. Maggie. (gentle music) - [Maggie Voiceover] It is so true what they say, that in the middle of tragedy life goes on, and it is merely how we choose to respond to it that makes any difference at all. I've spent the last two years focusing on me, my pain, my hurt, focusing on the problem, and it's killing me and everyone I love. If there were moments when Jason was alone or afraid, I know for certain if it were in my power, he would never want me to let another child feel that way. I know now that I'll never have the answers to all my questions until I see God, face to face. But he made me a survivor. I have been through the battle, endured the blood, sweat in tears. But I am holding on to the promise and the hope of tomorrow. (birds chirping) - Matthias. Matthias. Matthias. - What's wrong Maggie? - He's not here. He's gone. (dramatic music) (birds chirping) (dramatic music) Mathias, Matthias honey where are you? - [Charlie] Matthias. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (insects chirping) (gentle music) - Matthias. Matthias, don't move. - Okay. Give me a hand. - No. I don't wanna go back. - We won't come any closer. We'll stand right here. Can we please just talk? Why did you run away? - Because I don't wanna go to another foster home. - Why do you think that you have to go to another foster home? - I heard you and Charlie fighting. You're gonna let Mrs. Leonard take me away. (gentle music) How could you let 'em do that? I'm not Jason, you know. - I know that you're not Jason. And I know that I have not made you feel welcome here and that was so wrong. And I am so sorry. You see, when I lost my little boy, I came up here with a bunch of his things and I buried them. And I told myself that I was burying my heart too. That I was burying it so deep that I would never ever take a chance on getting hurt again. But you and Charlie, you have made me realize that I don't wanna bury my heart so deep that I miss out on all the good times that we can have together. (gentle music) I don't want you to be Jason. You are Matthias. And there is a place just for you in my heart. (gentle music) - Promise? - We are sure. (gentle music) - Give me your hand, Matthias. (dramatic music) - [Matthias] Mom. - Oh my gosh, Charlie, grab him. Honey, honey, we've got you. It's okay honey, we've got you. Hold on. Hold on. Oh my gosh, Charlie pull him up. Hang on, honey. Hang on, we've got you. Oh my gosh. (gentle music) Oh. - Wow, that was close. (gentle music) (all laughing) - Can we go home now? (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) - [Maggie Voiceover] I heard it said once that there's a season for everything. A time to be born and a time to die. A time to hurt and a time to heal. There's a time for us to weep and a time to laugh. A time to mourn and a time to dance. The time had come for me to put away Poe's stories. My season of mourning had come to an end. I finally understood that Jason was no longer in my past, but he was in my future. And Charlie and Matthias were my present. I realized that God had made everything beautiful in its time. And he had also put eternity forever in my heart. It feels so good to love again. It's so good to have my heart back.
