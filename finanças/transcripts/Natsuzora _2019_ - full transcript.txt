Yukijiro, what is love? huh? love... whattsa love? your accent slips, now!? I'll tell you Love is determination dee - ter - mih - nay - shun ? I don't simply feel love for a man's presence but, I can feel love towards his determination ok... so if that determination disappears love also disappears? exactly! to feel love for someone's presence that's absolute nonsense not sure about that... isn't that what love is? doesn't what you say sound like such rational love? to accept the concept of irrational love that is what makes women unhappy that's of the past I can't understand all of this! because it doesn't become new or become old isn't that what makes love, love? isn't love... woah! are you ok!? are you ok!? w w w what is love to you? stop jibber-jabbering!

Nacchan huh? would you mind taking a look at these base graphics that I made? umm... Mako-san, if you don't mind, as well? Of course, I will ok ♬～ it looks like it was done well yes… but, let's take a look just like this… wooooow… the sketch lines look clean even from the back come on, that's common knowledge so different compared to when Okuhara started yes… did you have to bring that up? my bad... this is good do you want to draw up the motion for this? yes! oh, Akane-chan, can you take a look after I finish? oh… uhh yea, of course th, thunx ok... thank you just a tad over-friendly... but can't really complain already adding -chan to our names? Kamiji Kouya… let us call him Kamicchi just because it's a short-film for a learning experience we still need to have the intention of this project going public that is understood so in this story there are no intentions of displaying any social satire? of course not that is not why this is being created to go out of your way to put a demon above the witch... a demon and witch... you're not trying to portray the U.S. - Japan relationship, are you? how the viewer interprets this is this not their freedom? of course they have a choice... simply, we want children to be able to enjoy it that way of thinking is that not the way of the past? ...the past? hey... Ikkyu-san... for comic movies.... to assume that it's only for children ♬～ hey, Okuhara-san yes? what happened to that girl? that girl? oh, you mean, Yumi? for now, she'll be working at Fuusha the way she thinks... I don't think she's wrong... huh? for women... marriage is a goal, right? to even think we should or shouldn't.... based on what women prioritize our lifestyle is determined by this work or marriage... we need to choose one or the other? no matter how we end up choosing we shouldn't be criticized for it ♬～ welcome back welcome back it's raining pretty hard Yumi, I'm home here... thank you Natsu, I let you meet him huh? what…!? Natsu... of course Jii-chan (grandpa) wouldn't come here but, Yumiko-chan... that's the type of guy you like, huh? I'm Takayama, Shoji Nice to meet you, I'm Natsu pretty good looking guy because Sho-chan he copied Jii-chan's style, right? huh? I showed him a photo remember, the group photo that the newspaper took? this person took a liking to Jii-chan so he started growing out his facial hair you actually took a liking to Jii-chan? he has the aura of a 1st generation pioneer now, I can listen to Jazz with a glass of whiskey in one hand snacking on some nuts doesn't it suit this look? he's usually munching on dumplings drinking tea... welcome home I'm home welcome home Yumiko-chan I heard you're working here? yep. you working hard, too, Yukijiro? yea any calls? for work? none I see... Onii-chan... ?? a guest? Yumi's... whatchamacallit...that thing!! huh? the guys she's eloping with!? you stupid!!

Yukijiro's girlfriend? huh? no way Remi-chan is Saitaro-san's girlfriend no way I'm over Sai-chan he's been too chicken oh～ thank goodness but, you guys are comrades, right? comrades? I suppose you can say that this person and I are comrades, too what does this person want to do in Tokyo? a writer writer? Jazz commentary, was it? Jazz? if you like Jazz, like... Glenn Miller? Benny Goodman? I have records Want me to play some? actually, I like modern Jazz modern...? if you have Coltrane or Garland please play that kottranej? kawland...? Shinjuku is in the process of becoming a hub of modern Jazz if you don't know that, you're outdated woah... what do you mean by outdated? yep… reeeeally outdated a survivor of the Moulin days… for each person to have their own treasures that's common practice to be called outdated for that is simply absurd you're in the movie industry with that mentality? what? music and movies to change with time is obvious to not notice this and be stuck with the mind of the past how is that wrong for me to call that outdated? however, I didn't call it wrong as you said, to each his own you know what I'll be waiting at the usual Jazz cafe oh, ok. I'll be there later I'll pay for this you should take this sorry, did we make him mad? well, it's natural for Nacchan to get angry I mean, I'mma get what he means'n all but they is other ways of sayin' it and you should watch your country accent! he's a successor of a certain rich person he even has a designated wife so that's why you two ran away before graduation? we didn't run. please say, we stepped out of all the constraints morning good morning good morning morning good morning oh, mornin' everyone's so early umm... I'll be joining you all in drawing up base graphics, from today huh? you're going to help us? why is that? we don't have much time... nonetheless, we need to complete this short film what happened? well... we need to make sure kids can enjoy this making this a fun and action-filled 'Hansel & Gretel'... it's ok, right? that's ok, right? right? yes… what exactly happened? Ikkyu-san, you know… isn't that way of thinking, something of the past? the past? hey, Ikkyu-san... to think that comic movies are just for kids going forward, we need to make comic movies for adults, as well I adon't agree the target of comic movies still need to be for kids then... what happens when these kids grow up to be adults? when watching the same comic movie on top of feeling nostalgia would there not be a new discovery of enjoyment? I think there would be... if they felt enjoyment when they were kids that same sense should still exist even after growing up to preserve those dreams and hope shouldn't that be the mission of these comic movies? if the dreams were like toys perhaps that's ok toys? things we may have not known when we were kids there are things we discover when we become adults unless such comic movies are created just as kids' toys don't you think they will eventually be disposed of? disposed of…? I believe that comic movies are not inferior to other movies not only that, more so the production quality needs to evolve or else, they will not survive the future Sakaba-kun, I understand however... regardless that there is meaning there or not you will make sure that kids can simply enjoy it, right? if you cannot achieve that no matter how much you raise up these ideals it's going to be labeled as 'boring' that... if you cannot do that you have failed yes... well, we don't want to make it boring, right? wait... is that why we need to work so hard? in order to save Ikkyu-san? that's a motivation-killer no... it's not for Ikkyusan it's for the project, itself also, I am determined that Mako-chan and Nacchan succeed on this project this short film is to achieve that good morning huh? did something happen? you're late, a little sorry... but, I stayed up all night and made all of these base graphics could you take a look and let me know if they're good? kami (God) - like timing... ...huh? why did you say such a thing to Naka-san? I got caught up in the conversation I didn't mean to say it... so you didn't really mean it? actually... I did not lie to say that Naka-san's comic movies are old how dare you... how could you say such a thing? not what he makes I said, the way he thinks is old how is that different!? well... I suppose so... what!? why do you get angry? huh? because you respect Naka-san? of course, that is the reason what Naka-san creates is wonderful it's entertaining and cute it captures children's hearts and adults can see it as cute, as well even you have a concept of cute, huh? I love cute things don't say that with a straight face... but... children don't simply feel 'cute it's not simply 'funny' either they are living, soaking in a variety of feelings from the world of course... even when I was a child, I encountered an air raid wandering the burned ruins I searched for my family fortunately, my parents survived that solitude... that feeling of despair from starvation I will never forget the cold-heartedness of adults and the powerlessness of being a child I experienced more than I can bear but on the other hand, the love of a stranger you experienced this, right? such childhood experiences is what you and I are composed of... ♬～ am I wrong? ♬～ what are you trying to say? so... to create something different from Naka-san this is our mission Naka-san please let us finish this project to the end we beg of you there seems to be a misunderstanding I don't intend on holding you guys back please let us create it as what we decide on together I understand that, too but... even you seem influenced by that Sakaba-kun, too, huh? I was skeptical at first, too Sakaba-san and Okuhara-san's enthusiasm is genuine both of them are thinking of the future the future of animation I'm surprised that you think so highly of them... not sure about Ikkyu-san... but Okuhara-san... Naka-san, you're te one who first recognized Nacchan's talents I... I want you to be a different animator than Naka-san and them what kind of animator is that? one who can portray the front and back of the world presenting reality beyond reality enabling children to experience the entirety this sort of animator I want to aim to be such a producer, myself ♬～ together, with you, I want to make this together...? even if it takes a life time I want to make this with you Natsu, as an old-time like myself I am dumbfounded together, with you, I want to make this together...? even if it takes a life time I want to make this with you uhh, yes! huh? Yumi...? what happened? what's up with you, Yumi? on a Sunday wait... are Sunday's off? oh, you didn't know? Ayami-san went out shopping Oniichan's working... but I don't think you need to take calls aww... I guess I'll go to the Jazz cafe, then what? since you're here Yumi, let's spend the day together yea? huh...?

I didn't say anything!! you didn't say because there is what!? who who who who who...? someone at work? that guy when we were all dancing? oh!! could it be, umm... Horiuchi-san!? Ikkyu-san!

Sachiko-san, perhaps, do you still...? Nacchan, I'm actually getting married soon what, married!? shh... let's sit down oh, I already sat... congratulations thanks but, in the end I couldn't wait for Sai-chan well, I'm sure my Onii-chan will be happy for you Madam actually setup the matchmaking he's very nice and has a stable life I feel bad for Sai-chan… you really shouldn't it's Sai-chan's fault always leaving me be I think so, too what would you like to order? oh, three butter curries uhh... I... it's on me three, please certainly so crazy... she was waiting this entire time and they weren't even dating but, I'm glad glad about what? Natsu, do you also think that it's best for women to receive stability through marriage? Yumi, do you not want to get married with that person? even without marriage shouldn't it be good to just simply be together? by doing so there would be no over-dependence on each other shouldn't the marriage style be different by person? isn't it because you can't get married? what? that guy already has someone arranged for him, right? it's because he left that behind it makes it all that better because it's him, trying to live from scratch even without getting married it felt good to simply be together, with him then, what the heck is marriage...? welcome oh, Madam Madam, it's been a while have you been well? yes you better be contacting your family in Obihiro yes, I am doing so Madam, this is my sister, Yumiko, from Hokkaido Oh, the one attending Hokkaido University, yes? yes thank you for always taking care of Natsu I heard you were even on the newspaper for getting into Hokkaido University you are the hope for your family Madam, I just heard about Sachiko-san getting married yes... even your brother was so worried Onii-chan was? he kept telling me to make sure Sachiko finds happiness well, even if he didn't say anything I was thinking about it, too is that so... Sai-chan I heard he started up a new company? yes it's a company for voices for dubbing foreign films he had always been pushing his limits but Sai-chan is finally working for himself, huh? Nacchan's pioneer spirit must have stimulated Sai-chan's heart no, I haven't done anything... Yumiko-san, please enjoy your stay in Tokyo yes, depending on the situation I may end up staying in Shinjuku huh? what? wha... what're you saying? I also have a pioneer spirit! Madam, I'd actually like to ask for your advice Yumi...? a Jazz cafe? yes she wants to open up a Jazz cafe in Shinjuku? then she started asking for Madam's advice I felt embarrassed does Madam know that they're eloping? nope Madam thinks this is after they graduate university so she said she'll provide support if they're serious that lady, always tells people that she'll support them Onii-chan! saying, "that lady" it's going to get back to you for saying something like that so she wants to support her writer boyfriend she's really into him this person and I are comrades if you think I'm being scammed by a guy you really don't need to worry about that I wonder if it's ok to let her be... hmm... that's a tough one Nacchan, if you were just her friend I would just say, let it be, let it be but she's family... but Nacchan, perhaps you don't need to bear this all on your own anymore, right? yes... ♬～ ☎(ringing) ☎ hello? mom? Natsu, at such an hour… did something happen? yea. mom... Yumi... Yumiko... Yumiko... she said if I say anything she won't come here anymore... so even if Yumi contacts you can you act like you didn't hear this from me? ok, no problem thanks for letting me know, Natsu ☎what should I do, mom...? regardless, I'm so glad you were there for her don't worry about me just make sure you stay by her side of course… if there's anything I can do, I'll do it… I'll think about what we should do I'll contact you again no… you shouldn't contact here I'll contact you again ok... I count on you talk to you again what happened? oh, you scared me who was that? huh? oh... it was Natsu what happened to Natsu? did something happen!? no... nothing what do you mean nothing calling here at this hour it was nothing seems she couldn't fall asleep you were saying you're counting on her huh, no... I just said, I'm counting on you to go to sleep it's disconnected already... I know... (phone rings once) Natsu… its' ok everyone is connected the production process of Natsu and everyone's short film 'Hansel & Gretel' was getting close to the homestretch err... still not satisfied...? these birds... what do they want to do? well of course, save Hansel & Gretel is that all? what else is there? these birds the fact that the witch was always in the forest were they not always carrying frustration toward this? frustration? isn't that why they save Hansel & Gretel? it's difficult to recognize this frustration I cannot see the birds, forming as one revolting against the witch I want this scene with the birds to seem... like they are picketing picketing? please re-do this as so please I can't handle being told these things on a whim if this keeps going on this project will never finish!! this is not a whim you always make these comments after someone finishes their drawings! well... that is when I realize something is not right... what!? Mako-san, let's calm down... regardless, please do this over please...

I'm so frustrated!! if you get angry, it'll feel even more frustrating... you end up focusing more on your frustrations... shut up. you don't need to add on with more cryptic statements sorry... Ikkyu-san is so severe... yes, I agree his ability to pinpoint these faults but when you calm down and think about it you actually realize that he's right... when you keep having to have to redo things this "realization" doesn't exist anymore! you were pretty similar back in the days don't put us together he actually complimented my base graphics what are you trying to say, huh? Mako-san, calmly... Natsu, in the last scene where Hansel & Gretel are saved she was struggling with the movement of the tree-monster is this how trees walk? what...? why did you feel that trees walk this way? why...? just a hunch... h... hunch...? meaning you have no reasoning? for starters... trees don't walk... how would there be reasoning? then, how old is this tree? the age of this tree? how long had this tree been in this forest? I think we need to be able to visualize this in its walk please use that as your reasoning even if you put it that way... how could I know!? just calm down if you get angry it's even more frustrating regardless, please redo this please it's impossible... how is that possible... ♬～ *sigh* Yohei-san hey, Nacchan could you show me the forest background? yea. look at'em all you want is something troubling you? that would be sugar-coating how I feel I can't keep up with Ikkyu-san's demands oh, this... I'm drawing up the tree-monster he's saying that he can't visualize the trees age in how it walks haha... seems like something he'd say he's even nit-picky to us in the art department just because he can't draw he doesn't understand our struggles I don't think that's it for how much he hounds others he, himself. is very studious of drawings? not just drawings oh, Ikkyu-san even knew about Tenyo's paintings really!? yep when it was awarded in Obihiro it was publicized in a small art magazine it seems he saw that and he asked if we were brothers he really appreciated that painting reeeeally Ikkyu-san felt for Tenyo's painting...! I don't know much about his producing abilities but his hunger towards drawings may be even more than an artist don't lose hope and keep at it I'll be working hard over here, too let's make this a great project I'll work hard thank you for your hard work ♬～(｢moonlight serenade ｣) Glenn Miller is so nice... uh ohhhhhhhh... if you say such things won't your modern jazz boyfriend get mad? pish posh, that's fine I have no intentions of adjusting my likes and dislikes to someone else by the way, what does he do every day? writing up drafts and he's taking them to a magazine called "Swing Journal" but it doesn't seem to be swinging his way well... you can't expect success from the beginning yea, that's common sense but it still seems to bring him down we've been getting into a lot of arguments lately oh really well, he does come from a rich and pampered lifestyle it may take some more time to get stronger and be more independent Yumiko-chan, you're pretty cool-headed we got attracted to each other if both of us don't get stronger it'd be unfair to the other person that's why we came out to Tokyo I see, I see ☎ oh, maybe it's a call for Saitaro-san's work? it's ok, it's ok this is Fuusha ☎｢this is from Hokkaido, area code 4141｣ oh… ☎｢please wait｣ oh, wrong number! sorry!! wha...? what happened? seems like it was a wrong number wait... we claim that from our side? oh hello? Mom? oh, Natsu ☎hey, Mom you called here earlier, didn't you? I did as we thought… oh... I wanted to properly say hello to Ayami-san it got cut off because she was there, huh...? hold on, I'll switch to Ayami-san oh... really? hold on hold on, just a sec (clearing throat) this is Ayami Ayami-san? Nice to meet you, this is Fujiko ohhhh, nice to meet you we're so grateful of you taking such great care of Yumiko we don't know how to thank you... it's no problem… she's helping out with the shop already getting plenty of help oh, and about Natsu I've been meaning to thank you so very sorry no, it goes both ways I think we can go past all of the formalities, yes? yes, I agree. excuse me for that so... Yumiko how are things? we are thinking of going to pick her up soon things seem to have cooled down quite a bit Mother, I think right now is a good chance chance? ok, understood. will go right away see you soon what's up with Yumiko ah!! so... what sort of chance is it now? of course, for Yumiko if she'll continue to move forward or make a stop this is a chance for Yumiko-chan, herself, to think it through ok... why would you keep such a secret!! shh... you're going to wake everybody to hide such information what's wrong with you? I needed some time time for what? for Yumiko's feelings to calm down… if we went right away it would be adding fuel to the fire knowing Yumiko's personality... well, you didn't need to keep it from me fathers, before thinking about their daughters' feelings they think of how to assassinate the other guy assassinate... we're not ninjas or anything assassinate... maybe that is the case... that's why I kept it to myself darnit, who the heck is this guy!? Takayama Shoji the eldest son of a renown department store in Sapporo you did research? of course I researched both of them submitted a notice of leave of absence to their university intentions of getting married? that, I can't research but according to Natsu, not as of now Ayami-san said that things have calmed down so if we were to go, right now would be the chance he's probably regretting it now unforgiveable, this guy!! who knows who brought up this idea in the first place it has to be the guy it's always the guy!! if Yumiko heard that... she'll say that's such a stereo type regardless, he's wrong. the guy is wrong! ok ok just like this, your usual reaction brings no progress you're going? I could go... but if one of her parents goes... her calming heart may get triggered and set her off again... what are you saying? no matter what Yumiko says her parents need to bring her back! and the one who will be hurt even more is Yumiko! as Natsu once said... the one who's not used to such situations should go... someone not used to this...? perhaps if Jii-chan approached this nicely this may lead to Yumiko becoming a tad more honest with her feelings... spoil Yumiko a bit, will you? err... that's impossible... and a few days later... Yumi, what happened? Natsu... you told our family, didn't you? huh... you betrayed me!! Natsu... what are you going to do? Yumi... Natsu, you told our family, didn't you? huh... you betrayed me!! Week 16 Natsu, the season of love has come ep. 95 ♬｢when the heavy door was opened a dark road continued on｣ ♬｢I kept walking forward beyond that was a whole new world｣ ♬｢even the winds that scatter the ice it will become my friend｣ ♬｢the colors of the big, round sky cannot be cut away｣ ♬｢I want to share with that nice girl｣ ♬｢lu lu lu…｣ his family found out about us what? our parents contacted the univserity and dormitory and asked around… even calling his home asking if they knew where we were I suppose that was predictable... so we decided to leave Tokyo where are you going? I don't know but even when we do, I'm not telling you anymore so I came here to get my wages up til' yesterday oh, ok ok sounds about right... wait, Yumi why are you running? running? what else is it that you're doing? if you like him so much, why are you running? Takayama-san, if you like Yumi why are you running? why can't you tell your parents? instead of the arranged marriage why can't you tell them that you want to be with Yumi? I told you... this is what we hate dealing with I can't think that you would be happy running away from such things, Yumi does an approved marriage equate to happiness? so does that mean, happiness needs to be provided from someone else? let's just call it quits who cares now... don't force it... what do you mean, 'force'? even if you're with me... I'm not forcing anything while you were with me nothing good came out of it, right? what are you talking about? the good stuff is going to start now we're going to make it good together ok! for the time being, let's eat yea? you haven't eaten breakfast yet, right? I wasn't serious to begin with... hey... you better watch what you say if you speak on impulse you're going to regret it it's not impulse I never thought this eloping would ever work oh that's what you meant what do you mean? how could you even think it would work? Takayama-san, don't you think it's because things didn't work out for you? huh? Ayami-san, what do you mean? even when you brought in drafts to the Jazz magazine it didn't work out, right? you found out your limits and thought, it wasn't supposed to be like this strictly speaking... Jazz is just a hobby Sho-chan... it's unrealistic to not succeed the family business it's impossible why? Yumi, you thought this way too, right? that's why you came here with me what do you mean? you were hoping that my parents found out, right? what? even you... because I'm the successor of the Marutaka Department store that's what you were attracted to, right? are you being serious? ♬～ you don't even like me anyways, right? always so calculating and so condescending I never felt your kindness towards me!! I couldn't be nice because you would be dependent on that then you should have depended on me more you're lacking charm! what do you mean, charm? ahh, you're a girl who lacks understanding are you saying that a girl who lacks understanding simply needs to understand the guy? that's what I'm so sick of woah, Natsu, why are you crying? Yumi, even from childhood she never relied on other people because of me... what? when we were 9 years old I popped out of nowhere the time when Yumi wanted to rely on her parents the most because I was there... Yumi couldn't rely on anyone even with that, Yumi accepted me... that's why, when it comes to 'family' or 'marriage' she has this dry approach it's all my fault... Natsu... but you know what...? Yumi, not even once she never lied not to me, not to anyone she never lied she always remained the truthful Yumi oh how I was saved by that for how long I've lived I've never met anyone as honest as Yumi I've never met someone so wonderful To think that Yumi is calculative and condescending you don't know Yumi at all! I'm not giving you Yumi! never in your life time! a marriage betwen you and Yumi I will never approve!! Natsu, calm down... I don't even have intetions of getting married I don't have intentions of getting married either You... you're unable to become free, huh? even if I became free and got married with a girl like you who can't even cook, what good is that!? hey you!! just let it be!! it's over the discussion is over it's you... assissinate... and shave that beard thank you for your hard work Jii-chan! Jii-chan! Taiju-san nice to meet you thank you for taking care of Yumiko Yumiko, I'm here to pick you up let's go home...yea? ♬～ Jii-chan, you're really going home already? my job is done places where there are more people than cows doesn't feel right do you want me to show you around Sapporo, Jii-chan? moreso, go home for everyone if you leave your father be we don't know what he'll do but, Jii-chan I'm surprised you came out to Tokyo what are you talking about it's because Mom didn't know what to do with me and told him to do so something Mom would think up actually, that came from Natsu... ?? uhh... I want to try out this parfait that they have in Tokyo parfait?? the Setsugetsu master told me about it let's go!! let's eat parfait and go home, Jii-chan how about you, Natsu? oh...

Ikkyu-san isn't just a condescending person, huh? I've never thought him as condescending huh? is that what you were thinking? of course not! no... I've never thought that way in a nut shell, he just really loves comic movies... yes. that's exactly so. and he's looking at the possibilities so wonderful the facial expressions are good, but... the movement of the body... those two... kind of frightening... yes... let's work as hard as them let's get to work yes yes Natsu, move forward, further and further forward and... ♬｢Everybody Loves Somebody Sometime｣ the short film that Natsu and everybody is working on was getting close to completion the time for voice-overs has come ok, thank you for all of your support Week 16 Natsu, the season of love has come ep. 96 ♬｢when the heavy door was opened a dark road continued on｣ ♬｢I kept walking forward beyond that was a whole new world｣ ♬｢even the winds that scatter the ice it will become my friend｣ ♬｢the colors of the big, round sky cannot be cut away｣ ♬｢I want to share with that nice girl｣ ♬｢lu lu lu…｣ you think I'm going to eat you guys?

Ahhh～～ well, uhhh... it's ok, it's ok it's ok!! I should back out it's ok～～ no! you need to do it until you can!! that's impossible hey you... you made all of us redo drawings over and over and you give up, just like that? you don't need to be so serious... with anything, unless you take it seriously nothing will stick regardless, let's do this!! hai!! Mako-chan!! hai!! ahhh～～!! Ikkyu-san!! hai!! nice!! Ikkyu-san, would you like an onigiri (rice ball)? thank you very much then shall I give you my bread? thank you very much oh... please don't drop the onigiri Momocchi!! it's just a joke does he look like he has a sense of humor? oh yea I do have a sense of humor. I love jokes oh is that so? even Nacchan your humor & serious border is unclear, too Mako-san! what, you have a problem? did you just call me Nacchan? huh? Mako-san, this is the first time that you called me Nacchan!! first time? are you sure? I'm so happy you don't need to cry about it that's great this means that through this short film we were able to bond and build a stronger relationship oh... Akane-chan, can I take one? woah... hey! you were too friendly from the beginning you are so insolent ok then... but I didn't say I won't give you any what? here thank you!! would've been nice if we came here before we started the project yea, if we had the extra time next time we have a project let's make sure to do something like this yes ♬～ Mako-san, what's wrong? did you find something? I found something oh... what did you find? I'm... I'm getting married finally... I found prince charming Mako-san... I'm not sure I understand… we were dating when we were students he was striving to become a skillful architect and he's planning to move to Italy soon... then he proposed to me... and I was contemplating on breaking up or not and with this project I was finally able to make a decision does that mean... you're going to quit being an animator? that's right how could you, Mako-san! that's why I wanted to make sure that this project succeeds make it succeed and be able to tell myself this is all I have then maybe, I would be able to make up my mind and break up but, it ended up being the opposite because I was satisfied with my work I thought that I could get married Mako-san... if I were to create something, going forward I saw the importance of right now being a breaking point and take a pause comparing myself to Nacchan and Ikkyu-san I felt that I was missing something I was so disappointed in myself that's not true! I cannot draw like you, Mako-san I cannot enjoy it all as much as you, yet I think about what it is is it talent? is it just that I'm wavering? I wanted to stop for a moment and think about it you are a great animator at least, in Japan there are not many animators at your level thank you... when you say it so cool-headed it makes me even happier Mako-san please come back again!! make me want to come back make me jealous going forward, make even a better comic movie, Nacchan I will I'll work hard, too! you don't need to why? when you say it it sounds sarcastic sarcastic...? but everyone, don't misunderstand me I'm going to be even happier I can say goodbye to this low-paying animator lifestyle so jealous!! Momocchi... right? yes... Shimoyama-san? what are you drawing? this happy moment with Mako-chan and everyone so we don't forget then we should all gather together and have him draw that in this peaceful forest with the sunlight beaming through the trees Natsu made a new vow to be an animator for life smile everyone smile ♬～ Natsu... continue to live life as you want with your mates that you love hey! you can't let it end yet will continue, next week Ikkyu-san, great job!
