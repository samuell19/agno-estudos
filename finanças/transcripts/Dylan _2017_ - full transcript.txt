- No you're the one who said we had to stop eating meat because of the fucking environment. And so I said okay and I've been eating vegetarian for two days while you post pictures of hamburgers that you eat for lunch, you hypocrite. Hold on. Hi. - Hi. All day right? - Yes. -Ten bucks. - Here you go. Just keep it, it's Friday, and you guys see enough of me as it is. - Thanks. Have a good weekend. - You too. - Mari, I said we'd taper off. - Yeah we'll I am just protein deficient from all like the fucking kale fumes I've been inhaling. - I told you when we started that you don't need to go full out. And I know you sneaking beef jerky at work. You think I don't notice your Instagram posts. It's a little weird that you complain so much. - Well I love to have my little surprises whenever the shoot wraps, and anyway I wanted to share my day with my man. - Um Well, everyone has their secrets I guess even you. - How do you know? - I can smell the smoke. - My God. - Busted. - Yes. - Hey you okay? You smoke more when you're overwhelmed. - Yeah I'm fine. I'm gonna taper off. What are those? - I think these are flowers. I just wanted to be boyfriend of the year, and drop these off to you and not harp on you for smoking right in front of me. - Well, you know what's not boyfriend of the year material? Inviting your college buddy to spend our anniversary weekend with us. - Listen, I know I'm an idiot, okay? But it's only for the night. And he's a great guy, and he's a big smoker, so you two can just kill yourselves together, alright? You're gonna love him. - Now I'mma fuck him. I have to. - Alright alright. I'll see you later. - See ya. - Bye. - Okay, well now you're just sucking up.

It was just hard to time it because I wasn't sure when you were gonna get home. Um..but I just want to thank you for letting me visit tonight. - Wow. I mean, that's really nice. You really didn't have to. - Honestly it's my pleasure.

He told me you're an over sharer. - Really. I would say authentic. - Authentic, I like that. I feel like I know you already. - Yeah well. I'mma put him on blast for having such a big mouth. He should be here any minute. - So try this Bruschetta before he eats it all. - Okay, thank you. Wanna wash your hands there chef? - Humans are inherently dirty. - Yeah, well I guess that's true. Wow, that's really good. - Thanks. It's a little honey on the Burrata. My mother always said you catch more flies with honey. - I've heard that. She must be really proud of you. - Who? - Your mom, your folks. For you running your own kitchen. - They're pretty disappointed, you know, they wanted me to be a lawyer. - Well, you gotta do you though. - That's absolutely right. I dropped out and now I'm doing what I want. - Good for you man. - Well you can't be scared of how other people see you. Can't hide what you are. - Yeah sometimes I worry in the office I'm too hard on people but you gotta get shit done you know. - I'll drink to that. - Thank you. None for you? - No, I don't drink. - What? - This is kind of a meet cute? - Um, well, isn't that kind of a romantic thing? - Right.

What, I'm sorry, did Nick tell you that? - Yes, Nick told me that. I guess he's an over sharer too. Anyway I've prepared a really nice- - Actually he's gonna be home any minute. - No I made him something else, we can start with the first course. - Dylan, I'd really like to wait for him if that's okay. Sets dish on table - Right. Of course. How rude. I never was good at first dates. - Well luckily, this ain't a date. - I just meant a meeting, a meeting of humans. - Right.

I'm glad I did something right. - Um, hey listen, I'm gonna come help you in a minute but first I'm just gonna- - Go smoke. - Well I was gonna say try Nick, but yeah I'm probably gonna steal one before he yells at me. Would you like one? - No, I don't smoke. - That's weird, Nick said that you did- - Anymore. He really loves you. He told me he wants to marry you. - Yes, he's asked me in the past, and it's one of the reasons I smoke. - How come? You're worth it. - Well you don't really know me that well, but I said that I would think about it, if we made it to five years. - And here you are. In your own home. - I'm gonna go grab that smoke. - I'll be here. - It's Nick, leave a message. - It's Nick leave a message. - Dylan? - You weren't supposed to see that. I have a confession to make. I'm not much of a chef. - That's okay. - Yeah, I'm sorry I lied. I just, I really wanted us to work. - You know, a friend of Nick's is a friend of mine. - Yeah, no, I know, but this isn't really working out the way I imagined it. It looks like I'm not boyfriend of the year. - I'm gonna go use the ladies room. Nick? Nick. You bastard. No, no no no. Please please please. No - What the fuck? - It's Nick, leave a message. - Hey man, it's Dylan. I'm here, we said eight right? Where are you guys? Give me a call. Jesus Christ.
