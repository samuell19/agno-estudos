I'm taking my first steps in this foreign place. I walked carrying my love. My feet walked without hesitation to meet my prince. I do not want to be late again. And I don't want to lose him again. And this blue envelope will be my guide here. By the way, I'm Niki and this is my story. My story with him. We've done things together since childhood. And I think almost all of the first things in my life I did with Nata. From the first time I went to school, first time riding a bike, first time fighting, and all of my other firsts. Miss. Gosh! Nata! Nata. Good morning! Let's go, boss! Wait a second! You're being bossy instead of apologizing. We're late. - There was an emergency. - What kind of emergency? Even though he is unfriendly, tartly, and likes to upset me, Nata is still my best friend. He was always there and is irreplaceable. Sir, the fare. Please keep the change. Who's that? - What? - There is a new student, they said. They said she's the daughter of a model. Wow, she's the daughter of my favorite actress. - Nata. - What? Vidya Rosa's daughter. So? Ta... Where are your parents? Why are you alone? They are working, ma'am. Oh, I see. I've read that you've changed schools six times already. From elementary to high school. Why is that? Please answer when you're being asked. I want to know your background, where you are from. There are many schools. Why did you chose this school? Answer me. Ma'am, may I have some aspirin? My head suddenly hurts. You have a headache? Sure, please go to the infirmary. Two halls from here, turn left. Mr. Hasan, where's her uniform? - Thank you, ma'am. - You're welcome. All right, guys. Let's have a break. Nata... Wait for me 'til I finish. - I'll be at the usual place. - Okay, bye. Bye. Want to listen with me? - Why are you here? - My migraine came back. Are you sick? No, I'm not sick. I'm just... waiting for Niki. - Nata! - Who is Niki? Take this. You're the new kid, right? My name is Niki. - My name is Annalise. Just call me Anna. - Anna. Okay. Are you really Vidya Rosa's daughter? My God, I'm a big fan of her. - I have her poster in my room. Right, Nat? - Yes. - I watch her shows till he's bored. Right? - Yeah. Are you two... Huh? No... We're just childhood friends. - My parents... - Let's go. - I'm talking to her. - Look at the time. - Okay. Bye. - Hurry up! Bye. Antiparasitic medicine? Hey... Have a taste. I hope it's not too sweet. Is it good? Yes, it's good. It's good. By the way, what did you say to Vidya Rosa's daughter'? I didn't say anything. Did you fall in love at first sight? Nonsense. You're not fun. - Nat. - Yeah? - Nat. - Yeah? What is it like to fall in love? I'm serious. Who between us will fall in love first? You, of course. - An attention seeker. - Hey! It's not that. But promise, whoever falls in love first, they'll have to say it. Okay? Pinky promise. - No, I don't like that. - Promise... I'm serious. Now smile... I was really curious. I wanted to know the feeling of falling in love. Who do you think will fall in love first between me and Nata? - Nata. - What? Lend me your homework. - You can't. - Don't be stingy. Anna, are we in the same class? Here. Sit here. I really want to take pictures with your mom and an autograph. May I? - Please forgive her, she is a bit dorky. - Okay? My mom is still in Paris. I'll tell you when she's back. Hey, Anna. I'm inviting you to join our cheerleading team. Usually someone who wants to join our team... must pass our rigorous vetting process. - But for you... - Thank you for your invite, Helen. But I'm joining the photographic club. - Huh? - We can join two clubs here. That club is only for nerds. Don't join... Wait, sir. You better join our cheerleader team. It's exciting, Na. Your body is very suitable for cheerleading. Like us, right? Want to think it first? This kid is too cocky! Enough. Let's go. Anna, don't listen to them. Don't be noisy, we're in a library. Don't want anybody throwing us a pen. I'm sorry. Why are there so many books? Just doing some catching up. I must catch up with some of the lessons I missed. Oh, yeah. Let's study with me and Nata at home instead of studying alone. Listen, studying with Nata is very exciting. First, we play on his trampoline, after that we study at his terrace. But now we must be serious because we have the state exams. Anna, we'll go out first. Do you have a brother, yeah? - You saw Dani? - Yes. And he isn't wearing any clothes. I wanna see him too. I really like seeing him. Very attentive... Kind... Totally different to Nata. Don't be too serious. Can you study if you're not serious? You always joke around. The teacher always scolds you, right? Your grades are bad. Do you remember? - Do you? - Yes, I do. That you're perfect and I'm not. Nik. What is that? According to Niki, that's our palace. My dad bought that when we were six. Why don't I see your parents? Oh, coincidentally, my parents and her parents are working in Papua. Niki and I live in the same residential. Stop peeking around, you'll get stye in your eyes. It seems Niki has grown up. She is blossoming. I'm sure many guys like her. We were often like this. Nata is always grumpy, not attentive, too serious. But I actually know... Nata can't hold a grudge with me. You're so cute, Nata. Nik! Stop being mad at me. I'll do anything if you'll stop being mad. Anything? Yeah, anything. Let's go. Miss, are you new? Let me introduce myself, I'm Jaka. The most pious and friendly cafeteria PIC here. From the 80's, this cafeteria is bestselling and legendary. So here it is. Because I think you have met the requirements to be one of the seven wonders of the world, in my opinion, you have to be in my sacred album. See? I have saved photos of pretty girls since long ago. Look, there is Miss lcha, Miss Patricia, almost all of them. You see this empty slot? This is for you, okay? Wait, I'll get my camera. Why are you so agitated? I must go to the airport now, my mom's back. Your mom's back? Nat. Can I ask for her autograph? Let's go to the airport now! You're kidding. Our class is starting. That's not important. Nata! Too late. - Taxi! - Nik! That's dangerous! Why he didn't stop? That's our taxi. The airport, please. Why are you so afraid to skip class? Just relax, my brother. - Only this time, right? - Yeah. We have arrived. Call her. - Wait. - What terminal? - I'll call my aunty. - Okay. Hello, Aunty? Which terminal is my mom at? Which plane? I'm here already. I'm already at the airport. What do you mean? Which terminal? She canceled her trip home. Seriously? You still have me and Nata. Yes. Sometimes, reality is doesn't fit with our expectation. Sometimes, we must wait a little longer to meet our loved ones. Whose idea was it to skip school yesterday? Yours? Yours? Anna... Anna. It hasn't been a month, yet you dare to skip school? I'm sorry, sir. I promise not to skip school again. Me too, sir. I can't promise you, sir. But I'll do my best for you. Niki! You don't even wear the correct socks to school. You three are punished. Come on. It's your fault. Hurry up! Pick that chair up. Huh, the car is very dirty... I'm sorry. Because of me, both of you got punishment. - It's okay. Right, Nat? - Yeah. -Let's wash it -Okay. SCHOOL BUS Is the event open? - How about this? - Yes, it's nice. This is nice. What magazine are you reading? Hey, let's study. Nata! Why did you stop? Nat! The music is already good. - Don't quip on me. - I'm serious. Nat... Show your skills at the art event. Go on stage instead of only in your room. I'm not interested. Come on, Nat. You must show your skill to the world. I'll sit in the front. I promise. - Can you do that? - Yes, I can. Your basketball game is at the same time, right? I'll make it there. If I've already sung on the stage and you're not there yet, what then? Then the world must be at its end. Empty promises. I'm serious. I'll sign you up. You said that you'd do anything. You're bringing your guitar. Are you performing? Yeah. - Are you serious? - Don't joke around. Cip, what are you doing? We're ready! Okay. Let's defeat them. They don't know who we are. Niki! Anna? She's still on the field, but the game is almost over. Now let's welcome a twelfth grader who's going to sing in our event. Let's welcome Nata! - I'm going over there. - Yeah, okay. - Hi, uh... - Hi. I'm Helena, the cheerleader captain. I'm Oliver. Who is that? Okay, bye... What's wrong, Hel? Get off the stage! Get off the stage! Get off the stage! Nata, come on. You can do it. Nata! Nata! Nata! Nata, Nata, Nata, Nata... Like he has said before, he'll do anything. And today, he isn't singing in his room again. Today he sings in front of many people. Showing his talent to the world. And on stage, he shines brightly. I'm sure he will be a great musician. I'm sure of it. Who are you? A basketball player. You're the captain of Pelita High, right? Yes. I'm Oliver. - Niki. - Hello. Nat, we better wait for her at the canteen. Let's go. I want to see my friend. - They're waiting for me. - Wait, Niki. Can I have your number? I'll give it when we meet again. - Bye. - Bye. You sing very good. - Oh, yeah? - I'm serious. Thank you. You know what? There was a guy who introduced himself to me. - Seriously? Who? - His name is Oliver. He is the captain of Pelita High. Then he asked for my number. - Did you give it? - No, but... Thank God. Why is that? - Should I have given it? - You should be careful to a guy who simply introduces himself like that. You think every guy is good? That's his negativity. You don't believe in love at first sight. There is no such thing as that. But there is infatuation at first sight, which is a love misconception. Because you haven't felt it. - Have you experienced it yet? - I haven't. But... It's hard to talk to someone unromantic. I'm realistic. Unlike you, I don't like to daydream. Hey, Nata. What's the title of that song? What song? Don't be shy. Don't make any more excuses. Hey, if you like Niki, just confess to her. Don't wait until you finish that song. It's too long. If you have the courage to love her, tell her. Don't hesitate. Hi. You're Oliver, right? I'm Helena. We met yesterday at the basketball competition. I'm the cheerleading captain here. Who are you looking for? -Niki, -Hey. - What are you doing here? - I'm looking for you. Oh, yeah. This is Nata, and this is Anna. - Nata. - I'm Oliver. - Anna. - Oliver. Remember your promise? What promise? You said to give me your number if we meet again. Did you forget? If you don't mind, I want to treat you to some ice cream. Then I'll take you home, okay? - What if I mind? - I'll come again tomorrow. Every day, until you say yes. I have to say bye to Nata and Anna first. I'll take your bag. Oliver's taking me home. Why with him? He'll do something to you. No. Don't overthink it, Nata. Nat, I think he isn't a bad guy. Anyways, she can protect herself. Listen to her. Come on, Nat. Don't worry. Bye. - So, you're cheerleading? - Yeah. - How long? - It's been three years. - Three years? - Yup. - Jumping, it's exciting. - Is that you hobby? Is Nata your boyfriend? - Nata? - Yes. - Best friend. - Oh... I don't think he likes me. His is like that to any new person. But he'll ease up. Then, do you like him? - We've been friends since we were small. - Oh... That's impossible. Who knows. This is Nata's house. Beside mine. Oh... That's normal then. Thanks for taking me home and treating me to x ice cream. - Bye. - Niki. - Okay, bye. Thank you. - Bye. This day is very happy. So much fun. For the first time, I went out with another guy. Oh, my God, this is not a normal moment. It must be put in the Guinness World of Records as the best moment of Nicole Ciputra's life. What is that? It's so cute. That's our school tradition. So, before Valentine's Day, all students can give a letter to anyone. On Valentine's Day, the letters are distributed. - Cute, right? - Yes, cute. One more thing. The envelope must be pink. Hello? Oliver asked me out. Hello, An? What're you up to? - Hello, good evening. - Good evening. This is the menu. Sorry. What do you want? - Up to you. - All right. Is the French from course? No, I'm half French. - So you've lived there? - I was born there. - How about you? - Me? I'm Javanese. - Oh, you're Javanese? - Yup. What is the meaning of "Aku kandung trisno"? That means... I have fallen in love already. Oh, thank you. You're unbelievable. Don't be cocky. What's wrong with you, Nat? Why the long face? I've always been with Niki since we were small. Suddenly she has a new world. A world that I don't know. But I don't want Niki to change. Nat, Niki's grown up. You should be happy she found her Prince Charming. Niki has found her first love. How about you? Maybe this is the best time to find your first love. If you find her, you must tell your feelings to her. Don't delay it. Niki! Why did you play in the rain? The exams are coming. - What is it, Nat? - What if you're behind on your studies? These are the sample papers. Why are you asking a sick person to study? Are you still sick? Have you eaten? - Have you eaten? - You're too noisy. This is your boyfriend's fault. Why did you date under the rain? Nat, you know what? He took me to the doctor. He is so attentive. And he gave me medicine. He isn't like you. Can you not compare me to him? He's different from me. Of course, he is so attentive. And you always lecture me. Don't talk about him again. I'll read the question. One. In studying Geography there is a formal object... which consists of the analysis... What's the answer? Nik! -Thanks -You're welcome. - I'll go in. - Okay, bye. Bye. Bye. - Nata! - Nik... - I want talk to you. - Me too. Oliver confessed, we're dating now. Nat, my feeling is mixed up. I'm feeling lightheaded. Why is your expression so flat? Congratulate me. I won't bother you again, because I have Oliver. You are the first one to know. Because you are the most kind and annoying best friend. You'll always be my best friend, right? Forever? Do you remember the promise we made? About who's the first to fall in love? Nat, you're right. That feeling is making me happy. You'll understand it once you feel it. It's okay, I'll clean it in the toilet. - Wait for a bit. - Okay. Hello? Am I late for Nata's last moment? Last moment? Niki, you better calm down. He is all right. - Are you that scared that I'll die? - Nata! Huh. It hurts. So this is real? Does it hurt? At least I don't suffer amnesia like in the movies. Hello? I'm sorry, Oliver, for leaving without telling you. Because Nata got into an accident. I think I'll stay with him tonight. I'm sorry. So tell me, how did this happen? I fell. - From? - My bike. - Don't press my wound. That hurts. - Sorry. - You're so weird, Nik. - Nata... I love you, Nik. Peace be upon you. Hello. Peace be upon you too. Anna. - Why didn't you come to school? - Are you sick? What's this? You have worms? - I'm okay. - Sure? An... Can you explain the photos? I like you, Nat. An... Thank you for liking me. But... But I like Niki. Nik! Niki! I want to say something. Oliver is here, Nat. It'll only take five minutes. Yesterday I wasn't joking. I'm serious. I also don't know when my feelings changed. I'm sorry, Nat. I only see you as a friend. Nata loves me? He loves me as more than just a friend? Why a girl and a boy can't just be friends in this world? Why does he love me? Love changes everything. Everything's changed from that day. Me and Nata couldn't be like we used to be. Things couldn't be the same anymore. Suddenly there was something off. Suddenly, something was different. The school was different too. It doesn't make me happy anymore. The end of high school felt dark. Give her more time, Nat. Niki needs time to adapt. Congrats, Nik. See you at Prom Night. - I know who you'll be with. - Yes! It's not like what you think. - An, how about you? - I passed. Congratulation, Nik. It's time to pick our costume for prom? Niki, Oliver will be your date, right? - Niki... - Yes, she will. I'm sure Oliver will be your couple. Guys, I'll go ahead. Slow down! Niki! Miss, you've come back. What's wrong, miss? I need to be alone. Okay, I'll leave you alone. I'm going to prepare your meal. Can I have this? No, you can't. Please. All right. - But take good care of that. - Yes. I'll do that till the end. Nik, there is a beautiful country. It is France. I was born there. I stayed in France till I as five. I went to Eiffel Tower for the first time, with my mom and dad. Then I went to its top floor. On the top floor, I wanted to see the scenery. I approached its fence, Suddenly there was a strong wind. I screamed... Then I was rescued. I'll take you there some day. Nik, what's wrong with you? I'm okay, Nata. I'm sorry, I said something in error. Forget it, Nik. I don't want to hear your explanation. But I want to explain it. Okay, please pick me up at 7:00. We'll go together to prom, right? I'm Soleh Solihun. Enjoy the 2008 Prom Night. High school will soon be over. The prom night that I've been waiting for is finally here. Tonight, everything must be perfect. Yeah, I'm almost finished. Are you sick? What's with your voice? Oh, my. You'd better rest at home. You could get worse. It's okay, I'm not alone. Get some rest, okay? Don't take a picture of me. It's okay. Oh, my God, Miss Niki. You're so pretty. You are the most beautiful girl in 2008, in my opinion. May I? For the picture album memories. Miss Helen. You're so pretty. Who's this? So handsome. I think it's my first time seeing him. Nik, you don't have a date? What's your illness? Mentally ill? Stop being dramatic. This is nothing... compared to everything you did to me. First, you took the spotlight in this school. From tenth grade, everyone in this school likes you more than me. Second, Oliver. You went out with him. In fact, I knew him first. And the last thing is... I don't want to lose to you. We are friends, Helen. And you, how could you do this? Nat, I want to talk. I want to say something too. You first. I'll leave for Austria tomorrow. To continue my music studies. How come I don't know? I didn't expect to be accepted. Take care, Nik. You take care too. I'll go pack. - Niki! - Nata! Nata! Nata! 5 YEARS LATER I joined the fashion industry around two years ago. But I've been into it since I was small. My inspiration is the 80's, Japan... My target market is teens and young adults. I will send you my design and the models I've dealt with, and then... Niki... Nata told me to give you this. I have known you since we were small. I have known you since our nerdy phase. You've always made my life more colorful. You've always made my life more exciting. With you, I'm alive. With you, I don't feel like I need anyone else. I want us to always be together. And I want to be the most special guy in your life. And for a long time... I've always loved you. Niki. I know. You and Nata have always been together since childhood. This is the first time you two haven been separated. Niki, if you love Nata, don't think too much. Love is a feeling, it's about our hearts. Love should not be half-hearted. Nata! Goodbye, ma'am. If you have any problems, please contact the Police. Hey. Stop! Oh, my God. My bags. Oh, right, it's impossible. Let's go, the time has come. - Okay. - Let's go. Nik? Why are you here? I just want to make sure that you're doing well. - Where are your things? - I left it in the cab. But, are you okay? You... disappeared without any news. Are you that angry with me? I'm only angry with myself. Just forget it. Anyway, you're here already. Who is your boyfriend now? What? How about you? Don't ask me. From then to now, you always beat me in that. I've been staying single. Turns out you're right. Life isn't like a fairy tale. By the way, your song was beautiful. Thanks. That song was for you. I also have something for you. FOR NATA
