(triumphant orchestra music) (upbeat, lively music) (boat's motor humming) - Monsieur Nolan, please. (knock at the door) - Yes. (door opens) - Monsieur Nolan? - Yes? (door closes) - Inspector Gerard. - Police, well, what's all this about? - Do you recognize this? - Sure. That's my wife's, where'd you get it? - It was found in a taxi about an hour ago. - Oh, I see. (sighs) That girl, she, she must have dropped it on the way to the casino. (laughs) You know what that's worth, don't ya? $200,000, I can't thank you enough. Hey, what are you doing? - There's no need to worry, monsieur. It will be quite safe. - What do ya mean, where ya going? - Your wife may collect it anytime tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Say, 10:00 at headquarters. - But we're pulling out at midnight. - I'm sorry, monsieur, there are certain formalities. - Such as? - Recovery fee, reward, fixed by the government at five percent. - Five percent? You're kidding. If you think I'm gonna, - I'm sorry, monsieur, I cannot argue. Now, if you'll excuse me. - Look, look, look, hold it, hold it, okay. Gotta pay, gotta pay, will you take a check? - Monsieur? - Then cash, will ya take cash? (sigh) Five percent, that's $10,000. Daylight robbery. (waves splashing) - Please, Monsieur, I cannot accept. - Can't you? Well, we'll see. - It would be breaking the law. - 10,000 we said. Two. Four. Six. Eight. 10. - Monsieur, I require a signature. - Signature. - A passport. - Passport. Does that take care of the formalities? - What formalities, monsieur. (laughing) - That's the kind of a cop I like. (buzzer beeping) Take it, Harry. Ah, monsieur. - Ah, pardon monsieur. - Your wife's calling Mr. Nolan from the casino. - To tell me that she's lost her bracelet. Stay and have a drink - Not on duty, monsieur. Bon soir. (roulette wheel spinning) - George, could you send Harry over with some cash? I've had a bad run. - Not on your life Merle. You just cost me 12 grand. - 12 grand? What are you talking about? - Where's your bracelet, honey? - My bracelet? It's here, I'm wearing it. - You sure. - Sure, I'm looking at it. - Harry, quick, get 'em. (upbeat music) (boat's motor humming) (gunshot) Stop them. (gunshots) (boat's motor humming) (gunshot) (gunshot) (gunshot) (boat clanking) (airplane engine revving) (champagne pouring) - Thank you. Wally? - Oh, Dud - To us. - To us. Boy, this is what I call living. First class, champagne. (chuckling) Beautiful girls, and a great big bankroll. Which reminds me. (snapping fingers) My, - Hm? - The green stuff, where's my money? - Didn't I tell you? - Didn't you tell me what? - I invested it for you. - You what? Oh no. - I've been looking forward to this for a long time. It's just the stake I needed. Do you play cricket? - Who wants to know about cricket?

(fingers snap) Suite eight. - [Bellhop] Thank you, this way. (suitcases collapse) - Double four seven five. (bright music) - Look at it. The place is full of tourists. There must be some sucker who'd love to buy a goldmine. - Mr. Jericho? Phone call for you, Mr. Jericho. - Yes? - Dudley. My dear friend. I was so delighted to hear of your arrival. - Russo, hello. - Russo? - [Russo] Are you staying long? - Oh, you know me, Russo, I'm never sure. Here today, - Well, before you go, come up to the villa. - Well, that's very civil of you, Russo, you just say when. - Would 2:00 suit you? - Well, not really, it's just a bit, - Well, it does suit me. - [Dudley] Now, look here, Russo. - 2:00 my friend. (receiver clicks) (suspenseful music) - Wire from Zurich. The franc's 11.6, the Deutsche mark's nine point five. - Call Grunwald. - I have. He's selling francs, buying sterling. - Very good, Miss Gray. Oh, Miss Gray, I'm expecting a visitor, a Mr. Jericho. - Jericho? - Yes. No friend of mine, but I find him amusing. You may, too. - Really, why? - He could have been a millionaire by now, but he has scruples. Like you. - What's he doing here? - If I know Jericho, he's looking for a sucker. (pants) - Take a look. That cost $2,000 of our money. It's paste, it's a fake. - You expect the real thing or that price? It's a genuine copy of the famous Gemini diamond. - Gemini? - Yeah, there used to be two of them. One of them got lost and has never been found again. - So, what's your bright idea? - Simple. We exchange this one for the real one, and that's the one we sell. (upbeat music) It's not just the money. I want to take Russo. - Why him? - Secret ambition. - Dud, Russo's a smart operator. - Every man has a weakness, stands to reason that every man can be conned. Now, Russo's weakness is that he wants that other diamond. (chuckles) He wants it very badly. - I've got a secret longing, too. - What's that? - To get the heck outta here. (mysterious music) Oh great, he's built himself a fortress. - The name is Jericho. I'm expected. - Hey, why don't we get out of here, huh? (lock clanging) - We're in, aren't we? (engine humming) You stay here. - Who's arguing? (door opens) (door shuts) - Mr. Jericho. - If we're being formal. If we're not, it's Dudley. If we're being really intimate, it's - We're not. (buttons clicking) Mr. Jericho's here. - [Russo] I'll be straight out. - You're Russo's secretary. - Well, now, who did you imagine I was? You know, Mr. Jericho, I merely work here. - Dudley. (laughing) My dear boy. It's good to see you. - Hello, Russo. - What's wrong, you look worried. - You're smiling, that's enough to worry anyone. - You haven't changed. Come in there. Let's have a drink and tell me how you are. - Quire a place. - You like it, my taste? - Mmm. In everything. - I'm glad you approve. Sit down. - I suppose you can buy anything. - Mmm. But not you, eh. You know, there is something lacking in you, my boy. A real dishonesty. (laughter) - I do alright. - Of course you do. What are you up to these days? - A little business here and there. Holiday, following the sun. (chuckling) - The sun. - I was hoping to do a little business with you, Russo. - Oh really? What kind of business? - That other Gemini. - What do you mean that other Gemini? - Well, you have one. And you once said you'd give half a million for the other. - Ah, oh yes. It was lost centuries ago. - It's been found. - It's a trick. I know coming from you, it's a trick. (chuckles) Let me give you a drink. (chuckling) - Alright, it's a trick. - Jericho. What are you trying to pull? - If you want it, I know who's got it. If you don't, say so. Would I lie to you? - Yes. Where did you hear about it? - [Jericho] In Paris. But I can arrange shipment. - How much? - Well, you put a price on it, half a million. Cash deal, in dollars. - That would take a couple of days. - No hurry. I'm on holiday. (safe combination clicking) - What is it, Miss Gray? - Your bonds have arrived, I'm just putting them away. (safe door clanging) - Jericho. Don't stand there, come and sit down. - Thank you. - Tell me. You've seen it, the other stone? - Oh yes. It's beautiful. - Hm. As beautiful as this? No, leave it, Miss Gray. (mysterious music) - (machine whirring) (cymbal roll) - You keep it here? - Why not? It's well protected. - And nobody's ever tried to steal it? - Oh yes, they tried. - And? - Come. I'll show you. Show you my guards. All expert marksmen. Open the door. (alarm) (chuckles) Special contact point, see? (doors open) It's alright, Phillip. Then, there is still the combination. And if someone should break that, the trouble really starts. I'll show you. I'm not boring you, am I? I'm rather proud of this. It's simple. If you life the diamond, - And it beams a radio signal which seals the room. - Exactly. And the room can only be opened from the outside. Watch me. (shields humming) (chuckling) Break the circuit, Miss Gray. (shields humming) - You mean to say with all that, somebody actually tried to steal it? - Yes. South American and his girl friend. - What happened? - It's funny, I'm not sure. When I heard the alarm, I took a trip abroad and was away for three months. Want to know what I found when I got back? (suspenseful chord) (chuckles) I think you'll need that drink now. (bright music) (door shuts) - Is that it? - Yeah, but expensive. - You know the old phrase, to make a buck, you've got to risk a buck. - Mmhmm. Dud. - Yeah? - I love you like a brother. You want me to be left an orphan? So we're poor, who cares. When I met you, I had 10 bucks, you had nothing. - But not for long. - True, five minutes later, you had 10 bucks and I had nothing. Look, do me a favor, forget Russo, it's too risky. - Gimme that, will you? - I'll do anything you want, anything you say. - Turn the radio on. Have some music. - Music he wants at a time like this. (upbeat music) (beeping) (upbeat music) (beeping) (upbeat music) Hey, what is that? - Simple jamming device. Blocks the radio signals. - And if it doesn't? - Tell my friends, (chokes) no flowers. (radio clicking) One. Two. So far, so good. That's just the window. Thanks. You're a genius. - Why? - This is just the job. (snaps fingers) Get the stone. Double four seven five. (phone ringing) - Yes. - Oh, Russo, it's Jericho. - Ah. What is it? - I've got a problem, you might call it running expenses. I need an advance, say, $10,000? - 10,000. Alright. When can you come up? - Shall we say, 11:00, okay? - Yes. (phone clicks) (kiss) - Here we go. (motor humming) (suspenseful music) (beeping) - Good luck, Dud. - There is no other kind. (motor humming) (suspenseful music) - Come in, Jericho. Now, you want an advance, I want your passport. - Passport? - Call it security. - Do you really think I'd do you out of a measly $10,000? - Oh, heaven forbid. I'm just being careful. - Where would I go? I'm doing business with you. Anyway, as you said. - Angelo. Sorry about this. (hand slaps) - Ah. Here we are. Funny I should have it with me. Where's the cash? - Right here. Alright, Angelo. (mysterious music) About face. I know you can read a combination at 20 yards. (chuckling) - Thank you. (money rustling) - You think I'd chisel you out of a few measly dollars? - Heaven forbid, I'm just being careful.

What is left, is right. (door creaking) (mysterious music) (case opening) (ominous music) (beeping) (beeping) (footsteps) (phone ringing) - Yes? Yes, Miss Gray? What is it? From Paris? What kind of business? Oh yes. Extraordinary. Good night. (receiver clicking) (suspenseful music) (car engine revving) (panting) - Well, did you get it? - Thanks, Pal. (car engine revving) (bright music) (suspenseful music) (sheets crumple) (clothes collapsing) (door shuts) (car engine revving) (brakes squealing) (gate opens) (car halts) - What the devil's going on? - My very question. You came here last night, did you not? - Huh? - And you persuaded me to part with $10,000. - I told you what that was for. - Transportation. - Transportation. - From Paris to here. - Right, it's on it's way. - Extraordinary. You see, I had a phone call from Paris early this morning, a Mademoiselle Claudine Lisette, and she told me she had the diamond I want. - If you ask me, someone's trying to con you. - I think I know who it is. - I promise you I have the genuine article. - Then what's she got? - Ask her, not me. (buzzer) - Yes? - Miss Lisette is calling you from the airport. - Put her on. (receiver clicking) Yes? - Oh, Monsieur Russo, it's Claudine Lisette. (speaking in a foreign language) - Will you reserve a suite at the Phoenicia for Mademoiselle Lisette right away, please? - [Miss Gray] Yes, Mr. Russo. (receiver clicks) - She has arrived. Now we shall see. I hope you can make dinner tonight. - Of course. - Angelo, open the door for Mr. Jericho. - Don't be too hard on her, will you? (door shuts) - Mr. Jericho? Can I offer you a lift? - No, thank you, I'll get a cab. - You won't find one up here. - Oh, well then I'll walk. - It's a six mile walk. - Ah. As much as that, eh? - What do you say? (bright music) (car engine revving) You know, you don't seem the type to be mixed up with Russo. - Neither do you. I admit I'm no angel, but I must say, some of Russo's business, ooo. - He was right, you do have scruples. - Haven't you? - They're a luxury I can't afford right now. - I don't believe that. - What could you know about me? We've only just met. (car squealing) (horn honking) (sighs) (laid back music) - Here she is. - Listen, who is this French dame? - I'm going to find out. - Claudine Lisette. - Oh yes. Sign here, please. - Have you a safe? - A safe, madame? - For my jewels. - Oh, yes, yes. We have a special vault for all our guests. This way, please. (door slides open) Suite seven. (safe clanking) (safe door shuts) (safe combination clicking) (mysterious music) - This way, madame. (door lock clicking) (drawers opening and closing) (luggage rattles) (luggage case snapping) (door creaks) (suspenseful music) (drawer open and shuts) (purse rattling) (door shuts) (door shuts) (door opens) (door shuts) (ominous music) - Well, what did you find? - Her name's Claudine Lisette. She did fly in from Paris. - Think her diamond's genuine? - Not a chance. - Then what's she up to, like? - I dunno. It could be fun finding out. (door opens) (door shuts) Well, what are you doing here? - Well, for one thing, I happen to live here. - No. - Mmhmm. Way up top. The poor quarter. - I thought Russo was generous. - Well, he is about some things. Now, don't forget, you're invited to dinner tonight. - Yeah. Wish I had the choice. - Well, he's sending a car for you and Miss Lisette. - That's very cozy, I was just going to try and break the ice with her. - She's having a bath, don't bother. - Oh. Well, perhaps I could persuade you to have a drink. - Well, you don't know until you try, do you? - I suppose Russo's told you about me. - Yes, he has. He told me you were a conman. True? - True. - Isn't that some sort of a crook? - Crook? No, I'm just someone who's learned to live by his wits. I've never robbed a bank or anything like that. It's hardly necessary. People will fall for anything nowadays, won't they? - I've fallen for a few lines myself. - I promise I won't throw you one. (acoustic guitar) - I really must go. - Mmm. - Now, you won't forget about Russo expecting you tonight. - No. - Car will pick you up at 7:00. - Right, I'll be ready. - Buh-Bye. - Buh-Bye. (cork pops) - Mademoiselle, that's astonishing. Your accuracy is remarkable. (giggling) - You'll never name this one. - Oh no? - [Russo] Well, the district? - Ah, this is far to easy. I went to school a few miles from there. It is Epernay, south of France. - Right. Ah, but now the vineyard. - Ah, the vineyard. Ah. It is far too sweet for Avis. And a little too dry for Martouche. So, I think this is, of course. This is from the vineyard on the banks of the Marnes. Chateau Vine, huh? - Correct. (chuckles) - And the year? - Well, it's an excellent one. It was bottled when I was so high. A little monster, with white stockings and pigtails. 1952. - Correct. Bravo. - Bravo - Jericho, we are in the presence of that rare combination: beauty and intelligence. - I'll second that. - Now, Claudine. I have deliberately avoided the subject of business. It ruins the appetite. But now, I'd like to hear about the other Gemini. Wouldn't you, Jericho? - I would, indeed. - You know the story of course. - Vaguely. - Well, it is rumored that they were a gift from Phillipe II to Isabella. She was so beautiful. You know, there is a picture of her in the Louvre. And it seems that, during some war, one of the stones was lost, and it turned up in Paris about a week ago. And I represent the dealer. (chuckles) - It's extraordinary. Don't you think so, Jericho? - I'm absolutely flabbergasted. - Mmm, why so? - Well, you see, - Allow me. You see, Claudine, I think the time has come for you to know that our friend, Mr. Jericho here, has also offered me the diamond. - The other Gemini? - Yes. - But it's impossible. I brought it with me from Paris, it's in my hotel safe. - But is it genuine? - Absolutely. - Well, one thing I know, there aren't three. (chuckles) I have one, and. Well, let me show you. - Yes. (door opening) - My Gemini's in here. And I can promise you that no one could sell me a fake. - And I can assure you that mine is real. - I mean, it's so simple to tell, isn't it? - I agree. - Of course. - One drop of acid, and if it's glass paste, you'll see what happens. - Well, there's no need to demonstrate. - No, no, I'd like to show you. (suspenseful music) - Ugh. (sniffing) - Mmm. (case shuts) - Oh, it's magnifique. It's exactly the same. - There, see. Nothing can affect the real diamond. - Imagine. (car engine revving) - Claudine? - Yes, darling. - You'll never pawn Russo off with a fake. - I agree. So, don't you try. You are so very attractive. It would be a pity. Would you drop me off at the next corner, please? - But the hotel's further on. - I have some business to attend to. (lively music) - Now, back up. You heard what I said. (car engine humming) (car engine roaring) (horse hooves clopping) - Hotel Phoenicia, as quick as you can. - What's up, something go wrong? (compartments slamming) - Cast your expert eye on that. Don't tell me, it's paste. - Yeah. I don't get it, you swapped, didn't you? - Yeah. - You don't seem too sure. - I could have sworn I did, but I was interrupted. I goofed and I returned the wrong one. I'm going back. - Yeah, but how will you get in? (mysterious music) (door shuts) (lock clicking) (beeping) (combination lock clicking) (mysterious music) (case shutting) (safe clicking) (footsteps) (door shuts) (light switch clicks) (beeping) (compartments shutting) (paper rustling) (door shuts) (papers rustling) (gasp) (suspenseful music) - Miss Gray? Miss Gray? I was calling you, Miss Gray. - Yes, I'm sorry. - You left this. - Oh, thank you. - Something wrong? - No, I just find it a trifle warm tonight. - Yes. It is rather warm. We'll open these. (curtains drawn) (windows open) 'Tis rather late. I shan't need you again. You can go home. - Thank you. Good night. - Good night. (ominous music) (car engine revving) - Your drink, sir. - Same again. - Make that two, please. (acoustic guitar) - Alright, ask me. What was I doing at Russo's? He got my passport, I was hoping I'd get it back. - And did you? - No, his drawer was locked. And, of course, you arrived. - How did you get in? - I got in. I'll ask you a question. Why didn't you tell Russo? - I don't know. Is that part of your overall plan? - I'm flying out of here in a day or two. Can I buy an extra ticket? - A trip with a conman doesn't sound very promising. - When I've done this deal, I'm through. - Your passport, maybe I can get it for you. - No, it's too risky. I've enough problems. - If you're trying to con Russo, please don't. He's very dangerous. Now, promise me, please. - I'll promise you one thing. When I get out of here, you're coming with me. (door opens) (door closes) - Did you get it? (laughter) - Alright, let's have it. - I shouldn't bother. - What? - How's your blood pressure? Fake. - But I promise you, I swapped it. - I promise you, it's paste. - Hold it. I think I've got it. Now, Claudine got out of that car in a town. - What about it? - This is just guessing, but supposing she went back there before me. She had the time. - But how'd she get in? - If I could find a way, so could she. - That girl? - This is a crazy thought. Have you heard of Georgina? - Georgina, sure, a great con girl. Do you think, - Now, look, I'm only just guessing. But who else could have brought this off. (mysterious music) (case opens) (door opens) (case shuts) (door creaking) (windows shutting) (case opens) (case shuts) (door opens) (door shuts) (lock clicking) (safe door shuts) (bright music) (door opens) (door closes) (knocking at door) (door creaking) (purse opening) - Ah, can you tell me where Mademoiselle Lisette is, please? - She has gone to the beach of the hotel. - And where's that? - It's over here, sir. Down on the left. - I see, thank you. (relaxing music) You're up early. - Ah. Well, you know what they say about the early bird. - Catching the worm. - Oui. You like it? My costume, that is. - You don't really need it. - Oh. - I meant the costume is incidental to your beauty. - Ah, a compliment. That is nice. - Not the first one, I'm sure. - It is the first from you. - You left so early last night. - And? - I was planning to lure you in the moonlight. - Must you have this moonlight, hm? - Not at this time of day. - Well. (slow music) (suspenseful music) (grunts) - Something wrong? - No, nothing. The time, what is the time? - Oh, I must go. - Oh, no. - Yes. I have booked a call to Paris. - Oh. - You will wait? I will not be very long. - Of course I'll wait. You make your call, I'll hang on. - Au revoir. - Au revoir (bright chord) - My bag. - Ah. (mysterious music) (car engine revving) - What happened? You're not usually late. - I just went to pick up the mail. - You don't seem yourself, Miss Gray. Am I, am I working you too hard? - No, no. - Perhaps you ought to relax more. - Please. (chuckling) - You and Jericho would make a fine pair. He has scruples and you have principles. Forget those letters. Take a couple of hours off, go and study yourself on the beach. - I might do that. (bright music) (relaxing music) - I am so sorry, darling. I was cut off, and then I had to wait for hours. - Don't worry. - No, I must apologize. - Don't apologize. (relaxing music) (suspenseful chord) (door opens) - Excuse me, have you got a light? - Oh, yes. One moment, signore. Your key. Suite eight. - Thank you. - I really appreciate it, because I have these things, and I just started smoking these kinds of cigars. They're hard to get, you know. - Are they? - [Wally] Really hard. - [Clerk] Here we have the light. - [Wally] Oh yes. You ever try anything like this? - [Clerk] No, I don't smoke. - [Wally] They're marvelous. Ah, that's too bad. Hard to get. - Oh yeah? - [Wally] Hard to get 'em through. Genuine. - [Clerk] From Havana, too? - No, no, just skin I picked up. I say, have you seen leather like this? - [Clerk] No, I haven't - [Wally] Thought you might like to see some of it. - [Clerk] It's very pretty, Oh yes. - [Wally] And I just started smoking these cigars. Are you in the hotel business a long time? - Yeah, two years now. - Oh yes, you got a marvelous chance. - Thank you very much. Sue. Sue! (ominous music) Get this back, but careful. (upbeat chase music) (car engine revving) (car engine roaring) - Susan! Susan! (horn blaring) Why stop, why not just run me down? - I was asking myself the same question. - What's all this about? - Well, I got the afternoon off. So, I thought I'd see you. And I went down to the beach. And I saw you with that girl, what's her name, Claudine? - Let me explain. - No, don't bother. I'm sure Mr. Jericho can talk himself out of anything. (car engine roaring) (door opens) (door shuts) - You return the key? - Yeah. - Fine. - You seem upset. Is it the girl who works for Russo? - Mmhmm. She spotted me at the beach. - Aw, that's too bad. Well, at least we've got the stone, that's all that matters. (phone ringing) - Hello? - Jericho? The money's here. Come over as soon as you like. Be sure to bring the stone. (luggage snaps) (knock at door) - Ah. - All packed? - Yes. Russo's just called. The money has arrived. I'm going up to the Villa. - I wouldn't if I were you. - Oh? - That stone you've got, that's just paste. - It's a funny thing. I was just coming to tell you the same thing about your stone. - That's very thoughtful of you. You take my word for it, yours is just a fake. - Oh, no. - Oh, yes, I promise you. - Huh. Well, shall we put it to the test? - Why not? (suspenseful music) - Have you got your stone? - Yes. - Mmm. Ah. (giggling) (comedic music) - Oh no. Georgina. The great Georgina. Well, how did you do it? - Oh, that would be telling. But in our game, all is fair, huh? - Well. We shall say that I'm not a good loser. - No hard feelings? - No. (chuckling) - I'm going to Paris. There's still time to buy another ticket. - No thanks. - We'd make a great team, you and I. - What time does your plane leave? - At six. - Hmm. - Half a million dollars. And no one I'd rather spend it with. - I'll think about it. (lively music) - That's obviously the case for the money. - [Wally] Do we follow her to Russo's? - No, we go ahead to the airport. - Signor Jericho. (paper crinkling) - It's your passport. - And the tickets. What's Miss Gray's number, please? - 104. - With that car of ours, we better move. (phone clicking) (ominous music) (case snaps) - I have it, I have it at last. Thank you, Claudine, you've made me a very happy man. - And now, I have a plane to catch. (case snapping) - This is fantastic. Absolutely identical. Every cut, every facet is the same. - Oui. Au revoir, Monsieur Russo. - Won't you stay for a drink to help me celebrate? - Oh, I would love to, but there is not time. Au revoir. (commotion) (ominous music) - Angelo, a bottle of champagne. (combination lock clicking) (case slides open) (suspenseful music) - Angelo. (bright music) - So, you did it. - Yes. Darling, are you coming? - No, but I couldn't let you go without saying goodbye. - You are so sweet. - You too. (kiss) - Darling, you don't need that moonlight. (laughter) Darling, you come with me. - No, not a chance. - Aw, is there someone else? She must be very beautiful. - She is. - And you can say no to all this? - You can have whatever's in that suitcase with my blessings. - Au revoir. - Au revoir. - Dud. - Okay? - Okay, the plane for Mexico leaves in two hours. - Good, book another ticket. - Who for? - Who do you think? Susan. - Oh, Susan. Susan? (car engine roaring) (bright music) - Allow me. (suspenseful music) (door shuts) (car engine roaring) (upbeat music) (door shuts) - Miss Gray, 104. - [Clerk] Yes. (door opens) (door shuts) (ominous music) (purse thuds) (lively music) - Boy, were we nearly taken. - The girl was. - Eh? - Russo's men were just here. I saw them leave. They took Claudine. - Claudine? Susan, they're the same girl. - The great Georgina. (screaming) (laughter) I knew it. It had to be. Of course. Who else had access to the vault? (gasping) Let he go. Such an actress. Such versatility. I like that in a woman. It appeals to me very much. However, this appeals to me more. (case snaps) (suspenseful chord) What's this? Well? - I don't understand, it was there at the airport this morning. - You fool, why didn't you check it? - How could I, Russo? - Where is it? - I have no idea. - Well, we have an excellent cure for a bad memory. (ominous music) (car horn honking) - Guard. - Guard. Guard. I've got a very urgent note for Mr. Russo. (scuffling) (keys rattling) Do you want him higher? - Yeah. - [Dudley] Got it? - Got it. - [Dudley] Lay him forward. Whoops. - [Wally] Whoops. (car engine revving) (body thuds) (groaning) - Come on, don't be foolish, where is it? Where is the money? - I told you, I don't know. (shrieks) - Wait. I have another idea. Not very large, the air may last an hour. Maybe two. Suffocation can be extremely painful, my dear. (doors open) - Russo, let her go. (case opening) It's all here. No. Let her go first. - What's she to you? - What's she to me? I planted her here. I planned the whole thing from start to finish. Now, let her go. Now, Russo. You can do anything you like to me, but let her go. - I have no intention of letting either of you go. Angelo. - The case. - The case? (gunshots) (body crashes) (dramatic music) (gunshots) (phone ringing) (car engine roaring) - Stop that car. Do you hear me? Stop them! (phone clicks) Angelo. Angelo. Angelo! Angelo, do you hear me? Idiot, answer me. Angelo, Angelo. - Si, si, Russo. - I'm locked in, open up, you fool. (kicks case) Get the car. What's this? The car! (car engine roaring) - The great, great Georgina. - And the superb Mr. Jericho. - I was there too, ya know. (laughter) - Now, to go back, when I first swapped, - I'd already swapped. - Well, when we were invited up by Russo? - No, I took no chances, I swapped back. - What about the second time? - Well, as Susan, I was there ahead of you. - What about when I filched your key? - I saw you. And I made another switch. - You really are the greatest. - No, I had an unfair advantage, I was there in the inside. - Does it matter? - No. You know, actually, Mr. Jericho, we make a fantastic team. And I'll be yours for a lifetime. - Let's hope it's not a short one. (dramatic music) - Put your foot down, Wally. - Down? It's on the ground already. (car squealing) (car engine roaring) - Come on. (gunshot) (gunshot) (gunshot) (brakes squealing) (gunshots) - Where's that smoke coming from? - We've got trouble. Dud. - Yeah? - Either we slow up or we blow up. (glass shatters) - Get the tires. (gunshots) - What are you doing? - Hey, that's my money. - I know Russo, it's the only way. - Oh. Alright. - It's money. It's my money. (brakes squealing) (gunshots) - Forget them, the money! - Half a million dollars. - I'm not complaining. - Open the boot. (car horn honking) (bright music) (slap) (jet engine roaring) - Thank you. - Paste. - I like it. There, hm? - I prefer it there. - Hm. Are you trying to make an honest woman of me? - That's the only way I see it. - Well, in that case. - Oh, Georgina. - Well, we couldn't throw it all to the wind, could we? Dud. - No, indeed. A girl must have a true ceremony. - Thank you. - Here's to Mr. and Mrs. Jericho. (suspenseful chord) Dud. (mysterious music) Well, if we're all going straight. (upbeat music) ♫ A little bit won't satisfy him ♫ That's why he takes from everyone ♫ As they pass by him ♫ Yes, they're pleased that they know ♫ Mr. Jericho ♫ Beware my friends ♫ I'm warning you ♫ Behind that smile is a devil ♫ You can't tell ♫ He hides it will ♫ But deep inside him he revels in the game he plays (triumphant music)
