We have with us today, a man who scarcely needs an introduction. Pootie Tang, good to have you with us. Sepatown. You've had incredible success in lots of fields, music, films, martial arts, pottery. How do you do it? I'm a pone tonie. Got my dillies on a peppatain. l hear that. Pootie, a lot of young artists say you are their inspiration. Well, l can't say the nay no, my brother. Wa-da-tah! You've got a new movie coming out, right? Yeah. lt's called ''Sine Your Pitty On The Runny Kind''. And who's in it, besides yourself? There's Trucky, Bad Bitty, Dirty Dee... ...Lacey, J.B.... ...Biggie Shorty... and Robert Vaughn. You have a clip you'd like to show us? Let's take a look at this clip from Pootie Tang's new movie: ''Sine Your Pitty On The Runny Kine''. lt was the year 2001 . lt was the best of times, it was the worst of times. The big city was thriving, but the inner city was dying. Who was killing it? This man, Dick Lecter, head of Corporate America. But the people had hope, because there was one man who could fight the power. One man who could stop the madness. One man who could beat Dick Lecter like the LAPD. That man... that man was Pootie Tang. See that guy? That's Bad Bitty, the baddest drug dealer in town. Hey, Bad Bitty, here comes Dirty Dee. Dirty bastard! That's Dirty Dee, the dirtiest dude around. He handles all of Corporate America's dirty work. Next to Dirty Dee... that's Froggy, the enforcer. Yo, Bad Bitty, how you been? l'm bad, Dirty Dee. You're still dirty, l can see. Lets deal, baby. - You got yours? - Froggy. Dirty money. You got yours? How do l know if they're any good? Let's test them out. Hey, kid! Come over here. That's Kid, the dumbest kid in town. What do you want, mister? Here, have some of this. ls it candy? - Told you. - Yeah. lt's the kind of candy that you smoke out of a pipe. Pipe candy! Pootie Tang! Capachow. Yeah! Pootie Tang! Dirty Dee, you a baddy daddy lamatai tebby chai. Get that Pootie! That's a canapan, all the way down. Mother...! Shut up, bitch. O.K., l quit. Run, Pootie, run! Come on! Get out, get out! Hiya, Pootie Tang. Sa da tay! Pootie Tang was born in a small town outside Gary, lndiana... ...and that town was called Chicago. Everyone noticed something different about the way Pootie would talk. lt baffled everyone... doctors, scientists... Let me put it like this. Pootie Tang is, was and will always be too cool for words. Pootie Tang was the most popular kid in town. We didn't always know what he was saying, but we knew what he meant. l knew l was his best friend. That's me, Trucky. He had a special effect on people, especially the ladies, not girls, grown ass-women. - Hiya, Pootie Tang. - l'm a tine cappy, my damie. Wa-da-tah. All right, Pootie Tang. But for some of the ladies, Pootie was too hot to handle. Damn you, Pootie Tang. l can't take no more of this. Who do you think you are, treating me this way? l've had it with you, you hear me talking? This is it, l'm finished with you. Stay out of my life. You think l'm joking? Take your shit and get out! Pootie Tang, l'm sick of you. Pootie...Pootie, don't go! Pootie Tang was an only child. His father, Daddy Tang, worked hard to raise Pootie right. He had this belt. He was so fast with it that before Pootie could do wrong, Daddy Tang would set him right. Don't grab those peas without asking your mama. May l dane on the cammies, Mama Di? Yes you may, Pootie Tang. That's better. You got to have respect to get respect, Pootie Tang. So, do you have any girlfriends at school, Pootie? Mama Di, there's a sine tipi tai in a classi ti, she's a solo toni. Don't you talk dirty to your mama, boy. Always got your head in them girls. Put your head in the books and leave the ladies alone. And that's how it was. Daddy Tang and his belt were always there teaching Pootie the difference between good and bad. When l say he was always there, l mean he was always there. Pootie, let's steal some apples. When Pootie was six, his mother died, leaving him and his father alone. Pootie was very sad. l know, son. But his father was a comfort to him. Don't slurp your soup in here, boy! Two weeks later, another terrible tragedy. His father was fatally injured at the steel mill. lt was incredible. Only the third time a man had been mauled by a gorilla at that steel mill. On his deathbed, Daddy Tang had Pootie make a solemn promise. Pootie, l know l brought you up tough, but that's cos l love you. lt's tough out there, Pootie. You've got drugs... ...crime...gorillas. l ain't gonna be here much longer. So, l'm gonna give you this. Pootie, that's my belt. As long as you got right on your side, you can whip anyone's ass, with just that belt. l know you love the ladies, and Lord knows the ladies love you. Don't let the ladies come between you and the belt. Those were Daddy Tang's last words. ''Don't let the ladies come between you and the belt.'' But there was something else about the ladies Daddy Tang forgot to tell Pootie. Pootie Tang turned out just fine. Daddy Tang would have been proud. Pootie had it all. Hit records, movies, magazine covers, fancy cars, famous friends, beautiful clothes and ladies, ladies, ladies. Through it all, l was right there by his side. That's me, Trucky. And that's my man, Pootie Tang. Big-time celebrity, crime fighter and role model to children. Pootie Tang has a message for the children of America. So you better wapatah to the bammies, cos the cammietowns a biddie on the Pannie Stai! Pootie says cigarettes and fast food are bad like netatai. And don't drink malt liquor cos you don't need to, cos you're O.K., sa da tay. Also, eat all your vegetables, and don't bang the dillies. That's Frank. Dick Lecter's right hand man. So what do we care? We care because he's making these. People have been making P.S.A.'s for years. lt hasn't made a difference. Eddie, hit me with those figures. Since the inception of Pootie Tang's PSA campaign, sales of Lecter burgers are down 30 per cent, Lecter cigarettes down 20 per cent and Lecter whisky is almost out of business. Someone's getting to these kids and it's killing us. lt's killing us. lt's killing us. Hello, Mr. Lecter. - Frank, l have a job for you. - Yes, sir. l'll tell you, Pootie Tang's one bad brother, man. That's J.B. and Lacey. We make up Pootie's crew. Pootie Tang will draw you a picture of how he's gonna kick your ass then mail it to you ten days in advance. The picture gets there. You go, ''What the hell is this?'' Then he knocks on your door, properly kicks your ass, and you still won't know what happened. Got that right. He's a kick-ass artiste. He's like the Da Vinci of ass-kicking. That's him right? Pootie Tang, the Da Vinci of ass-kicking. Pootie Tang whips your ass so bad, you can write it off on your taxes. Right here. Ass whipping number one, ass whipping number two... That's just getting beat up. l'd also like to add that Pootie Tang can kick some ass too, boy. Here comes Pootie Tang now. - Hey, Pootie! - We were just talking about you. Hey man, you going to Biggie Shorty's party tomorrow? l guess you're wondering who is Biggie Shorty. l'm Biggie Shorty. l'll tell you about me and Pootie Tang. Since the very day we met, l knew Pootie was to be my man. l knew all l had to do was wait. One day, all that bullshit would catch up with Pootie and he would be mine. You going to Biggie Shorty's party tomorrow? Ranacan. You're a party man! There's gonna be some bitches in there! You right, respect the women. Respect the women. Look at that car! Man, that car's big. And long like a whole snake. That car's so big, it's got its own sky. Yeah, it's big too. - Keep it running. - Yes, sir. Hiya, fellas! Kinda hot for a hootenanny, huh? Hear that? A hootenanny. What the hell is a damn hootenanny? l'm looking for Pootie Tang. Pootie Tang. What do you want with Pootie Tang? l need to talk to him. l'm a representative of Lecter Corp. Do you know what that is? Great. Dick Lecter, the CEO of Lecter Corp. likes you. He likes you, Pootie. He wants to make you a very rich man. l have a contract here for Pootie to endorse. Tasty heavy pork chunk cereal. lt's delicious. lt's a wonderful product. Kids love it and kids love you. We just want to put that together. Nah di. That's a canapan to the senachai. l didn't even say how much it pays. 20 million dollars to sign for just one year. What do you say, Pootie? l got to say the nay no, my brother. Wa-da-tah. Wa-da-tah? How do you say the nay no to 20 million, why? Maybe Pootie don't wanna sign because he knows you're full of it. First of all, he knows that cereal's full of sugar. Number two, that's not all that you guys sell. You sell cigarettes, whisky, burgers, switchblades, and it also says you will no longer let Pootie do P.S.A's. telling kids to eat healthy and to be smart. Sure, exclusivity goes without saying. l'm sure your ugly intentions go without saying. Take a walk, money man. See my damie? Pootie Tang don't wa-da-tah to the shana cow cos that's my cama cama leepa-chai, dig? Hey Tang, to you they're children, to me they're dollar signs. Cover your grill! Sa da tay! You're funny man, you are a funny man. Wild boy! Pootie smacked the taste out of Frank's mouth. Man, that was a funny time. But one man was not laughing at all. Pootie Tang goes out there and makes everybody love him. And he tells them not to buy my products. He steals from me. What do l do? l say take my money, here take it. And he says no. l guess you're wondering, who is this bitch? That's lreenie, Dick Lecter's main squeeze, and the most dangerous woman on the planet. She don't look it, but she can bring any man down. l know what makes Pootie Tang... tick...tock...tick. That's cool. All right. lt's all gone now, Pootie. What do you wanna do? Lepatime. What's he got on his mind? We're starting from scratch, l guess. Pootie knows what to do. This is gonna be good. l'll play back the levels the way you set them. No instruments, no vocals, no levels. Everything silent. Set it on me. Bleed. Pootie don't need no words, don't even need no music. We have got a hit, baby. l like it, everybody seems to like it. Now something you'll all like. We got the world premiere from Pootie Tang and you know it'll be out of this world. You all loved his last record, ''Sine Your Pitty On The Runny Kine''. You're all gonna love this new one. The new one is called... So let's listen up to the new record by Pootie Tang, called... from Pootie Tang. Damn, this is good. This is good. Pootie did it again. Pootie too good. Turn that noise down, dammit! Legendary Pootie Tang has done it again, with his new song entitled... ...already considered one of the greatest hits of all time. This was the scene earlier today, as fans mobbed Pootie Tang in the street. Many said they hadn't heard an artist this profound since Al B Sure. Pootie was blowing up now. We're talking big. l mean Macarena big. We're talking Electric Slide big. Bentleys and girls in bikini thongs big. Everybody want a piece of Pootie. You think l'm playing? Wait a minute. We got Pootie Tang in the house tonight. Come on, Pootie. l need you to sing a song with me. l love you, Pootie Tang. That's a bata shane, my tellie. Wa-da-tah. Pootie Tang was with us here tonight. Pootie Tang! l love you, l want you. l want to be with you. Pootie, please, please... l want you, l love you Pootie... Don't leave me out here on my lonesome. Give a girl something! lt's not right. She's fine! Why did Pootie pass that up? Cos she's crazy. She's licking milk out of a bowl. - Biggie Shorty. - Pootie Tang! All right! Bata shane, my dillie? Same as always, baby. You come back tomorrow, we gonna have a party. Talk about all the sisters and me. - You gonna be there? - Wa-da-tah! All right, Pootie! Hey, young boys! Hey! Look at her! She's a lady! Oh, man, pull up! What do you want? - You want something? - Yeah, baby, l want it. What do you want? How about the two of us? How much? What's your problem? Just cos a girl dresses fancy and stands on street corners near some whores, - you think she's hooking? - Wouldn't you? No, l wouldn't. l'm a lady, you greasy bastard. Ah, yeah! Pootie Tang and the boys are here. Yo, man, a Biggie Shorty party is exclusive. They don't let nobody in. They got to line around the block. You know what? Nobody we know could get in this party. They don't let no light in, no electricity, no water. They don't let air in. Air is right now going, ''Hey, l'm air. l'm on the list''. And they won't let air in. Air gets in everywhere. That's how exclusive a Biggie Shorty party is. Hey, you know what else? lt's hard to get in too. l hate you! Pretty girl. Pretty girl! Pretty girl out there! Pootie, you are the sexiest bastard on God's green earth. Yeah. l tell you though, someday, l'm gonna get a piece of you for myself. - Sepatown. - Sepatown, my ass! You gonna be inside a bed with me someday. You mark my words, you skinny wonderful man. Pretty girl. Pretty girl? Sexy! Pretty girl? Pretty girl! How does a woman get to you anyway? lt's like a state secret. How to be with Pootie Tang. All right, get off him. He don't want none of your mess. l tell you what, Pootie. Someday, you gonna meet your match in a woman. Some day you gonna meet the Darth Vader of T and A. Some woman's gonna kick your ass and love you to death. And you gonna be in the dumps, banged to death by the dark side of love. And on that day, Pootie, l'm gonna be there. And l'm gonna make sweet love to you. Sexy girl! - Damn, man. - Oh, l'm sorry. l thought you were somebody else, man. Sorry, man. Sorry! l didn't get your name, did l? Damn, do l know you? Do you want me to pull your legs off? Pardon me? Wanna make out? l might enjoy that. l just might enjoy that. You know, l just might enjoy that. O.K., wait a minute... Wait a minute! Call me a sissy, but you need to stop. You're tearing me apart, you're killing me. - You want me to stop? - Well, yes l do. O.K., then tell me something. - What do you wanna know? - What's Pootie's secret? l can't tell you that. l would never do anything to hurt Pootie Tang. But like l said, lreenie knew how to break a brother down. - l can't tell you that. - You can't? All right. O.K., wait, l'll tell you, l'll tell you. l'll tell you. lt's the belt. lt's magical. He can kick anybody's ass with that damn belt. Freeze, sucker. Give me your money, you fancy pants bastard or l'll stick this in you deep. Wa-da-tah, my damie. l'm not your damie. Give me your cash. l know you got it. Hey, l told you to back off. Pootie, hey, Pootie. Pootie. The craziest thing happened to me. l'm in the club... Pootie look out! Bang, bang, bang! Pootie? Everything under control? Kayed a brother, di. Kayed a brother, di! I'm a shamey day. I'm a shamey day! lt hurts Pootie to kill a man. But he knows he's got to do it. But it hurts him so bad to right those wrongs. My man, Pootie Tang. Come back on the bettie tai! Come back on the bettie tai! Come back on the bettie tai! Pootie Tang? All right, my damie. Why didn't Trucky tell Pootie he told lreenie all his business? Just running his mouth. When you see a man brought back from the dead, you forget shit. Or maybe you're just a dumb ass. Stop the movie. Remember when Daddy Tang told little Pootie, ''Don't let the ladies come between you and the belt''. Daddy Tang forgot to tell Pootie about his only weakness... ...hoes. Even Pootie Tang's belt was no match for lreenie. You can't beat a hoe with a belt. They like that shit. l'm sorry. Did my cart hit your cart? l'm so sorry about that. Did l hurt you? What a drag. Again, l am very...sorry. Will you do something for me? Sign your pretty name. Sign it...sign it. He's signed it. He's signed it. He's signed it. He signed it? Nice job, lreenie. You're a damn genius, baby. ''l, Pootie Tang, surrender to Lecter Corp. ''all rights to my image and likeness. ''l will wholeheartedly endorse all Lecter Corp. products ''and will do my best to convince the children of the world ''the above-mentioned are all clean, safe ''and should be used by all of them.'' Not the tipi tais, no! You are part of the corporation just like us. Thought you could stay out of it? Welcome aboard, Pootie Tang. Are you looking for something, my friend? l've got it all, now. Shocking news today as Pootie Tang endorses several controversial products for Lecter Corp., the infamous giant corporation. Something on the TV about Pootie Tang. Man, my kids looked up to him. They don't even look at Dad like they looked at him. But since he crossed, my little man came up to me the other day and was like, ''How can he do that bullshit, man?'' Pootie Tang has made my children cry. l'll not support him anymore. Lecter Corp. effectively owns the name Pootie Tang, his image and copyright. Pootie Tang has agreed to do several commercials endorsing our sneakers, food products, cigarettes, whisky, mace, switchblades, rat poison... - Pootie! - Oh, no. l always had a high opinion of Pootie Tang, but the way things are going, not only is he sold out, he's scraping the bottom of the barrel. He was drugged by that crazy lreenie. Haven't you been watching the movie? That's what disturbs me. He's telling kids not to go to school, to eat fast food, to do drugs. This is not the Pootie Tang l used to know and admire. He would never tell kids stuff like that. You're in denial. He's doing dirt to his own reputation. - You don't know Pootie Tang. - l don't know Pootie Tang? l know Pootie Tang and this isn't the Pootie Tang l thought l knew. l thought a man of your stature would have better sense than to fall for that. Look, this is all falling apart. The man used to be admired by people of all walks of life. lf the world is gonna fall for this mess about my Pootie Tang, then maybe the world don't deserve him. What do you think Pootie Tang needs at this point in his life? He just needs some of my good loving, and he will be all right. - You watch. - l hope you're right. - l know l am. - We'll see. - We'll see. - That's right. - Watch. - l will. Pootie Tang was messed up. - Punk bitch! - Sell out! Look at him. - Get a job, you bum. - Get it together! Pootie looked like someone who did it and ran. Pootie turned to the only woman who could help him, Biggie Shorty. Pootie! - Pootie! Poor Pootie Tang. - Tipi tais. That's all right. Mama's got you. lt's all right. Biggie Shorty's gonna take care of you. Don't you worry. Gonna have sex with you too, you know. Finally. Are you sure you gotta go, Pootie? Yeah. That's a damn shame. You're the best piece of man l ever had. You could stay here and live between my bosoms for the rest of your life. Pootie got to flittie tai. Man's got to do, l suppose. l guess whilst you're gone, they can't make you do more commercials. Where you gonna go? l tell you what. l got a little farmhouse outside Greenville. lt was my mama's. lt ain't much but nobody's living there. You go out there, find yourself, blah, blah, blah. Then you come back to me, O.K.? That's a fine tine, baby. Give me some of that bony ass one more time before you hit the road. Man, l hate prison. Prison sucks. l reckon it's supposed to. You got something for me? This is fine dirt, man, good dirt. l'm gonna hook you up. l hate these bastards. They make me shower every day. They never let me get dirty. l'm Dirty Dee, dammit! Dirty Dee, you gonna be dirty again soon. l promise. lt's that Pootie Tang. He got to be stopped. l'm the one that's gonna stop him. Pootie damn Tang! Pootie! Pootie was headed to the farm l wanted to go with him. Because it was all my fault. Everything that happened, it's all my fault. l told that bitch all these things and she just used it against him. l was sorry. lt was killing me. l only did it for the ass. That deri-teri was all the dinie. l felt like he'd saved my life. And l'd messed his all up. l wanted him to forgive me. Trucky, you my main damie, man. Ain't no bad tammies between us. l wondered if he meant it. I'm a baino denie. l wanted to go to the farm with him. Wa-da-tah! All right, me and Pootie going to the farm! l'm looking forward to this farm life. Enough of the city. This is just what we need, Pootie. Live off the fat of the land, work hard, farming, farming, farming. l can't wait, man. l cannot wait. l'm gonna milk that cow. All that milk, two per cent fat free, skimmed milk. All that milk. Chocolate milk. l don't need no television, cappuccino, partying all night long. l'm gonna put blisters on my hands. Sweat on my back. That's what l want. Shit! Oh man, my pants. My damn pants. Farming, farming, farming. This is not the thing, man. This ain't cool. Dirty shoes, dirty pants, dirty shirt, stinky. lt's hotter than a camel's hump here, mosquitoes all over my shirt. l can't do it, man. Whose dog is following me around? Whose dog is that? Could be anybody's dog. l didn't want to leave Pootie, but l couldn't do that survivor shit. l'll back my ass, l need conveniences, man. On the other hand, Pootie was loving every minute of it. He was rejuvenated. Rejuvenated. He was juvenated before, lost it and got juvenated again. And when Pootie planted his first corn stalk... Damie. ...he was happy. Too damn happy, if you ask me. lt was just corn. lt was just what he needed to take his mind off his troubles. Rown on the crowny town. Morning. - Hi, Daddy. - Not now, Stacy, honey. There's a new fella in town. He's coming in here in a minute. - So? - Maybe you can marry him. Daddy! Cut that shit out, Stacy. Here he comes. Hi, there. You got your can filled all right? This is my daughter, Stacy. Dillie on... ...my damie. She's a looker, ain't she? Dirty Dee! God, you stink! Thank you. - l want to talk about Pootie Tang. - Public enemy number one. We learned that anything can be addictive. We pumped our burgers so full of MSD people can't even taste real food anymore. Today American kids don't eat because they're hungry. They eat because they've just got to have another Lecter burger. l own Pootie's name. l don't need him to sell my products anymore. l've got thousands of them all over the country. l'm just gonna give them the clothes and this training tape. Remember, when making a public appearance Pootie Tang always struts like this. Next week we're opening a brand new nationwide chain of burger stands. Pootie's Bad Time Burgers. ln fact, the only thing that could mess it up is if the real Pootie showed up. But that ain't good enough. l want him dead. l'd like to put that bitch in the ground myself, but l ain't magical. l've been trying to get Pootie for years. He's offed all my boys. All l got left is Froggy. Nobody knows where Pootie is. l know where he is. l got people everywhere. Nobody can hide from Corporate America. And as far as how to beat him... Maybe this will help. Hello. Remember her? That's Stacy, the sheriff's daughter. He's been trying to get her married since she was 12 years old. Hello, is anybody here? l'm sorry, l... l made you a pie. Do you want the pie? l know l'm not a pretty girl or... ...or sexy. You'd probably like a... ...sexy girl, right? Baby... ...I'm gonna sine your pitty on the runny kine. That's what makes Pootie Tang a real hero. He can't see a woman not loving herself. He's gonna put the love in. l say just give her a compliment. l like your shoes. Have you been working out? What you doing with your hair? But l tell you what. l'm only gonna buy this hero shit, so many times. Meanwhile, back in the city, all hell was breaking loose. l'm talking about drug dealing, drug using, booty shaking, too much damn TV, drinking, people eating too much and getting fat, fighting, kids out of school, ain't nobody reading. People acting straight damn fools. And Corporate America was loving it. Look at them, it's a party. Since he left, everything just went bonkers. Everybody lost their mind. Pootie Tang, you shouldn't do this. Come back to the city where you belong. Back on the farm, the worst happened. Pootie Tang's corn stalk died. For the third time in his life, Pootie lost the only important thing to him. First his family, then his belt, and now his corn died. Farm life was driving Pootie crazy. He must have lost his damn mind. He's down on his knees crying over a piece of corn. Not even popcorn, regular damn corn. Pootie Tang had lost hope. lt would take a miracle to bring him back. Pootie. Pootie Tang. Up here, Pootie. Hey, watch the leaves. Daddy? Damn right l'm your Daddy. What you doing running away from your problems? Did l teach you like that? Don't mumble, boy. Pootie, my boy? Mama Di. Pootie, you're a good man. l'm proud of you. You have so much love in you. You can give it like a gift. Your father was wrong to tell you to guard it like a secret. What was that? - Shut your mouth. - Hey, woman. You corn ass fool. Pootie, teach the world right from wrong, but love the world at the same time. That's the key. Where's your belt, boy? You let the ladies get your belt? l knew that would happen. Now you lost all your confidence. l'm here to tell you there's nothing special about that belt. l bought it a Piggly Wiggly for 95 cents. You don't need that belt, cos you got the goodness in your heart. Now go out there and take that and kick some ass. Don't mumble, boy. Now go out there, take that goodness, and teach the world right from wrong. l think maybe you and me got something to talk about. l understand you and...Stacy there... got to know each other. Had yourself a little time? Yeah! That's terrific! When's the wedding? Like l say, l sure would be mighty proud to have you for a son-in-law. What the hell? Pootie Tang! Pootie Tang! What you doing way out here? You know these guys? l've come to call you out, maggot eating bitch. You ain't come one, but many tine tanies. l gets by with a little help from my friends. Now, listen here, fellas. We don't want no trouble here. Why don't you just move on through? - What's up, papa-in-law? - Back off there. l'm sheriff of this town. Hold up, hold up! Rewind that. Let me see that one more time. l'm sheriff of this town. That had to hurt his ass. l know he's embarrassed. Slap him like a bitch. He shouldn't have messed around and got Pootie Tang mad. Question: where you think you going? Wait! Hold up Pootie. Capa-town, my ass. You're not so bad now are you? Guess you...slapped him like a bitch. Yeah. Now... like l was saying. l was searching for Pootie high and low. Then l remembered he was at the farm. All this time l'd been talking about the farm, how did l forget he was there? l got there just in time. - Pootie, come back right now. - What's the dabble, di? There's a wedding going on here. They're making you sell products, even when you're not there! l'm talking about cigarettes. And look, Pootie Tang malt liquor. They got all these Pootie-a-likes hawking all this shit. And everybody thinks it's you. Come back to the city, so everybody knows the truth. Come on. All right, Pootie Tang. l ain't the marrying type. l don't make my bed, l leave the toilet seat up... But she is a lovely lady, though. Pootie Tang and l are thrilled to be opening this, the first Pootie Tang Bad Time Burger restaurant, right Pootie? Sa da tay! Sa da tay. Got that? That ain't Pootie Tang. That's Doodie Tang. That ain't Pootie Tang either. l know that ain't Pootie Tang. l just said it's Doodie Tang. Shut up! Sepatown, tipi tais. Yo sepatown, tipi tais. Christ. - That's Pootie Tang! - Wa-da-tah. Don't pay attention to him. That's nobody. This is Pootie Tang. Yes, l'm Pootie. Now, clap it up my hammies... ...rinatine, my America. Coola may my... You think you've solved the problem? Guess again. See, l got more Pooties than you do. You're not only late, but you're outnumbered. By this time tomorrow, there will be so many Pooties, you won't matter. He ain't alone, mister rich man. l'm here too. Pootie! Pootie! You looking at my ass? You bastards ain't going any place. Bye-bye Bad Time. All right! l got him, Pootie. Capachow! Pootie Tang is back! Pootie Tang! - No, no Pootie. - l got to say the nay no, my brother.
