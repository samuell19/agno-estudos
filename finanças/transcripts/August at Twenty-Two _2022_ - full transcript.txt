But, um, he has a really great job now. - Ah, is he less miserable? - No. -More, in fact. -Yikes. But so rich. So here we go. -I guess that's how that goes. -Hey! - I was about to roll a joint. - Please. -Hey, man. -Yeah. Hey. You roll the best little joints.

Yeah. - So, Cal. - Uh, yeah. What are you doing these days? Well, I graduated, um, in May. And I'm, uh, doing the acting thing, so. -Acting? -Yes. -Awesome. -Yeah. Uh, do you have anything coming up that-- like a TV show? Um, I-- yeah, I'm surprised I am a-- a star suddenly. Um, no. Um, I, um, I'm just-- I'm focusing on my craft. Awesome. Are you happy your brother's home? Yeah, both him and his ego. Anybody want a hit? Yes. -Out the window? -I mean, it's ideal, but don't need to worry about it too much. Oh, isn't it pretty cool?

S-- yeah. Oh, there you go. So I saw my ex was selling his bed on Facebook the other day, and I had, like, a complete panic attack. Emily heard me from across the hall and came running in thinking that someone had died. -It was crazy. -That's awful. -Yeah. -It is so awful. I'm so sorry that you're going through that. It's been pretty traumatic, but this bed was, like, a symbol of our relationship, you know? - Yeah. - So. I mean, it seems like a lot of-- I feel like-- I just feel like beds are like-- I mean, I feel like beds are symbols of, like, my past relationships. Like, for different reasons. -This is Cal. -I'm Cal. I'm-- uh, I'm Jacob's best friend from home. I'm Kit. I live here. Amazing. It's beautiful. Thank you. Thanks so much. Thank you. - So beautiful. - Thank you. Yeah, so do you know-- um, you know Emily and that's how you know Jacob, are you friends with Emily? Well, we all went to college together. - So. - Cool.

The apartment is, like, so cute. -Yeah. -Yeah. Yeah. I really like it. And it's like-- it's much more convenient for him. -It's really close. -Well, Long Island isn't that far out, he was like, what, 45 minutes away, right? Yeah, but I mean, this is like-- it's 15-- this is 15 minutes to Midtown, which is, I mean, it's, like, two stops or one depending on where you're going on the seven. -So for auditions and stuff. -Yeah, definitely. -Yeah. -Yeah, it's better. It's a good thing you got, um, him and Kit connected. -That's awesome. -Yeah. Yeah. It seems like a good match. It is. Yeah. It's a funny story actually. We, like, all met doing college acapella together. -Oh, my God. -Just deeply-- I love Jay's group. I saw them a few times. And when they came to Long Island, we had this, like-- well, he had them all over sleeping at his house. And, um, I've slept there too, and it was a crazy night. -It was fun. -Those boys are wild. -They're good boys. -They're good boys. -Yeah. They're rowdy. -But they're loud. - Yeah. - They're rowdy. They are. Truly, some of my most stressful period-- like, the most stressful period in my life. Mm. Collegiate a cappella. -That's it for me. -Yeah. Aside from a few very unfortunate pregnancy scares. Well, you know what they say about periods -and I don't know. -What? The most stressful period's the one you don't get. Oh, this is-- yeah, that's true. Yeah. I didn't-- I'm sorry. Do you smoke? Do you want a cigarette? Yeah. Yeah. I have my weird ear cigarette, which you are welcome to decline. -Sounds delicious. -They're menthols also. Thank you so much for offer offering. That sounds... Pretty girls never light their own cigarettes. That's what they say. Yeah, it was about trees. Um, I'm gonna head out. Oh, okay. Great to see you. - It was nice to meet you. - Yeah. Yeah. - Okay. Um, bye. - Bye. You headed out? Um, yeah. Yeah. I've been here for, like, four hours, so. -Totally. -Yeah. Well, we should-- we should catch up sometime. I mean, not, like, at one of these parties. Um, Jay, this-- - Are you going? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. -I'm heading out. -All right. - Well, I'll catch you soon. - Definitely. Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. We'll talk. - It was nice to meet you. Yeah, it was nice meeting you too. Thanks for coming. -Get home safe. -Yep. Yep. Yep. - Bye, Cal. - Bye. Have fun. That sounds bad. Uh, hey, you've reached Jacob. I'm not here right now but if you leave a message, I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks. Bye. Oh, my God, he's so hot. He looks just like Bonny Bear or-- or any of the baristas at Joe's Coffee. What does Bonny Bear look like though? I don't think anyone really knows. It's just the general essence of Bonny-- -Precisely, the aura. -The aura. - The aura. - Stop that. Holy shit! Holy shit! That's Rachel Kleinberg. Rachel. Rachel. Hi. - Oh, my God! Bobby! - Hi. Hi, baby. How are you? I'm doing so great. How are you? - I'm good. - Hi. - Hey. - How are you? I'm good. It's so good to see you guys. -How's postgrad life? -Oh, it's amazing. I'm acting. -Oh, my God. In what? -Yeah. Yeah. Anything I can get my hands on. That sounds familiar. Oh, what are you doing? I'm actually in a workshop for the new Gossip girl musical. Oh, my God, that's amazing. How-- how-- how did you get that? Um, they put out a casting call for athletically inclined belters, and I was like, "XOXO, me." - Right? - What! We don't wanna keep you from your day. - You seem really busy. - Oh, no. It was not a bother at all. I'm so happy I bumped into you. - It's great to see you. - Be well. - Have a great summer. - Yes. - Really good to see you. - Good to see you. - Bye. - Bye. -Don't be jealous of her. -I am-- I'm not jealous. Athletically inclined belter. -XOXO, me. -Me. Oh. But, like, you've never walked in on your parents having sex, right? 'Cause that-- I haven't but-- -Excuse me. Would you like to... -Jay? -...share with the class? -What's this now? I've walked in on my parents having sex thrice. -Three times? -Thrice. -Three times. -Literally. No longer an accident at that point. No, it's not an accident. Like, fool me once. -Fool me-- -Fool me once-- His parents have the healthiest sex life. Okay, okay, let's change the subject, please. -I've almost walked in on them. -Oh, my God. Jesus. I will literally never forget it. It was after Passover four years ago. To be fair, we were drinking a lot of Manischewitz. Yeah. Too much Manischewitz. Um, babe, Kit wants to know if we're going back with her tonight or no. -What should I say? -Yeah, I have to. I have to, uh, be at Schedler tomorrow at 10:00 for callbacks. - Okay. - What are you called back for? Great Comet Tour. -That's amazing! -Wow. They're doing a non-eq tour before an equity tour? - It's equity. - That's amazing! -Oh, you'll get it. 100%. -Right? -You know, we'll see. It's-- -Perfect. - Just a call back. - No. Yeah, babe. You're gonna kill it. Thank you so much for helping out. Oh, my God. Of course. Thank you. It's just the usual routine. -Uh, dinner, wash up, books. -Yes. A little massage if she needs one. -Incredible. -Bedtime. -Yes. -Okay? Um, don't forget to turn on the sound machine and the nightlight. And there's a $20 bill on the counter if you wanna get yourself something. -Thanks so much. -Okay. Love you. You be a good girl. I like my house. I like it too. Do you know my apartment only has one room in it? What? Cal! What's wrong? The light? Okay. Good night. Close your eyes. Okay. Hello. Hi. Oh, um, not much. I'm-- I'm-- I'm, uh, working on acting stuff. I'm working a-- a monologue. This is objectively the nicest, like, kids' apartment that I've seen. Thank you. I'm-- I'm-- yeah, I'm definitely very lucky. Yeah. It's amazing that you could afford it on a photographer's salary. That's incredible. Um, I'm gonna get us beer. Do you drink? - Okay. I'll get us beers. - Yes. Did the lights come with the apartment? They're very cool. Um, they actually-- the overheads, yeah, the overheads did. They're really, really nice. Um, but the-- the other ones, like, all the lamps and everything, that's Jay. -He designed it. -Yeah. That makes sense. - Yeah, he's good at it. - So good. When we were little, he had this, like, star lamp thing and we would turn it on and lay on Adrian's bed and, like, just lay and look at-- That's a star projector. - Yes. - Yeah. I literally have it in my room right now. Oh, my God. That is amazing. Yeah. It's the fucking best. I love it. I heard he took it to college. Yeah. That's super cool. I-- uh, I must tell you. I watched the web series you made in college. -Oh, okay. -And... and, uh, it's really good. I watched a few episodes. It's very funny. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Thanks. It's heady. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Very weird. Very funny. Um, my sister and I have an idea for a web series that we've been, like, kicking around for a while. -I've never done anything. -What's your idea? Um, so my sister has autism and the idea was sort of, like, a day in the life with a bunch of different people who are on the spectrum and-- and sort of following them around and seeing what it is. Yeah. That's a really good idea. Thanks. It was hers, not mine. I can't take credit. My brother is actually also on the spectrum. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah. -Yep, yep, yep. He's a genius. -Yeah. He's also, like, weirdly formal. - Really? - Yes. How so? Like, at a family dinner, if I haven't seen him for a while, I'll, like-- Oh, shit. Um, this is Jay. - Do you mind if I take it? - No. By all means. -Tell him I say hi. -I will. - Hello, baby. - Hi. That's-- yep. That's Cal. Yeah. We're having a good time. No, we're just chilling.

He's just, like, a very busy person right now. - So just scheduling. - Yeah. - What are you scheduling? - Just life. - Fair. - Nothing in particular. Cool. Um... what are you doing Friday night? Um... I'm not sure yet. -Why? -You should model for me. Oh. Yes, I always look, like, very strange in photos. Like, my eyes are just, like, really wide. - I don't believe you. - I swear. -You're an actor. -Yes. You can be in front of a camera. Hi. What's up? Um, nothing much. I am getting ready. I'm taking pictures with Em tonight. Okay. You need to chill. One, they're not new head shots. And two, if they were, it'd be fine because I look very different than I looked six months ago. Um, okay. I gotta call you back later. Okay? Uh, I'll talk to you soon. I love you. Bye. Hello. - Oh, my God. - Hi. You look incredible. I'm fully not wearing pants right now. I can see that. You look fucking incredible. Let's go. Let's do this. Okay. Okay. Can you-- did you get it? It's not really going. Let me get it. You gotta learn how to do this yourself. I can be an independent woman. Yeah. Stealing my lighter back. Okay. I'm gonna do stills, okay? Yeah. Okay. - What do I-- how do you-- - Let me see. How do you want me? Ah, just do what you're doing. Just have a little-- there we go. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on. If you just go, like, a little bit back again. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Perfect. Okay. Yeah. -You look amazing. -Thank you. Everyone's mattress is on the street. Everyone's like, "Fuck this mattress. I had no sex this summer." - It's cursed. - It's cursed. - How does-- - Yes, yes. - Yes. - Do this-- What do you-- you're not even taking a photo. I am. - Like, what do you-- should I-- - Yeah. You just caught me off guard. That's the point. Go and then come back. -Okay. -Go and then come back. Okay. I'm gonna strut in. - Yes. Strut in. - Strut. Strut. Strut. Yes. -Yes. -Okay. Where-- where are you going? Em! I think I can count on-- I think I can count on, um, one hand, maybe two hands how many times I've smoked a cigarette in my life. How many of those are with me? -Too many. -Too many. More than half, you think? -Um-- -Fuck! -I need to stop giving you-- -No. -I like your cigarettes. -Hmm. My gross menthols. I'm a bad influence. -You're a fine influence. -Stay away. -Yeah. -You're a good influence even. - We'll see. - Yes. Time will tell. -Yeah. I'm trying to quit. -Oh, you are? -I'm trying to quit. -You're doing a great job. I'm trying to reduce. I'm trying to red-- -Right, right, right. -I'm trying to reduce. I-- I-- I have since college. I used to be, like, full on, like, pack a day girl. -But I'm not anymore. -A pack a day? Yeah, of menthols with fucking fiberglass in them. I cannot see you as a smoker. What's this? I mean, I can't see you as a serious smoker. I was. I was. Like, every fucking stupid 22 year old. I was like, you know, I tried-- I started smoking to try to impress a girl. Didn't impress her. Just started getting lung cancer. You dated girls before Jay? Mm-hmm. Well, like, not, like, dated dated. But many-- uh, many a crush and many a smooch. -You know. -Yeah. I-- um, I like, um, half dated a few girls in college. None that I would have called my girlfriend 'cause it-- it wasn't quite perfect. Like, everything wasn't quite right, but, um... -Yeah. -Mm-hmm. It was a good-- good time. A good time. Yeah. I think for me it was, like, more of a timing issue because... I don't know, I didn't really, like, embrace my queerness or really, like, uh, dive into it until my senior year-- dive right in there-- until my senior year of college though. So I was like-- it was a short-lived moment 'cause second semester I started, like, casually hook up with Jacob. -Oh, okay. -So. -Yeah, well. -He-- uh, then he trapped me. -There you go. -Right. Well, RIP the lesbian you might have been. The missed opportunities. I-- truly, I would've been an amazing lesbian. Why do you say that? I-- because I'm an amazing listener. You are a good listener. That's fair. That's fair. -Women are a lot of work. -We are a lot. -Yeah. -A lot of work. Well, you know, there's still time. - Well. - Someday. Not if you're dating Jay. I mean, the two aren't necessarily mutually exclusive, so. What does that mean? Well, like, I don't know. I mean he-- last night he was, like, talking about maybe opening up the relationship. So we wanna do... How do you feel about that? Um... How do you feel about that? I don't-- I don't know. I don't know. -Hmm? -I'm okay. -I love your camera. -Yeah? It's my mom's. Yeah. It's really-- it's cool. Can I-- uh, can I see it? Can I take a picture of you? -I wanna take a picture of you. -Why? You took so many of me. I feel like it's only-- Yes, 'cause I live back here and-- fine. -Oh. You give up so easily. -Fine. -I-- you deserve it. -You just gave on-- You gave in real fast. You were making a good argument. I've been making you stand in the street all day in a-- in a-- Like a street walker. Beautiful outfit. I'm wearing nothing. -Okay. -Where should I go? Here? Yeah, right there. The light is pretty on your face. Is it on? -Because I put the green... -Yeah. ...but it's not-- turn on. -Um, hold on. Can I see? -Yeah. Yep. It died. It-- it's dead. Your opportunity must wait till tomorrow. She'll have more energy in the morning. Uh-- oh. Sorry. Oh, I'm so sorry. I forgot my lyric. Do you mind-- um, can I start over really quickly? Sure. Go-- whatever you need. Thanks so much. Thank you. I really appreciate it. Thank you. Okay. Oh, that was so fun. - That was amazing. - Thank you. Can we go right now? I have to be here for, like... one more hour. Just one more hour. I have to make rent. It-- one hour, Cal. I'm like... Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Just put this down. I don't know. I just, like, need a burger. Okay, let me just-- thank you, everyone, so much for coming. This was so sweet. I really appreciate it. Tip-- tip your waiters. Tip the bartenders. They're working tirelessly for you. And I will be here tomorrow. Thank you. They love me. Encore. They're gonna have to wait. They will. 'Cause I'm here for you, baby. Thank you, mister. - What's going on? - Nothing. - There's-- - Mi get-- Mi get drunky with Em Em. Um, and now me have no prospects, so that's where I'm at. Why were you drinking with Em? Well, okay, actually it was super cool. We had-- um, Em had this idea for, like, a video photo project and I got super dressed up and it was, like, Andy Warhol inspired and it was just a really fucking fun and cool night. Did you miss your audition this morning? No, I didn't miss it. I went. I went, I went. I just, like, wasn't feeling my A game. So I didn't-- wasn't perf. 'Cause you drank last night. But it was, like, for art, you know what I mean? Are-- are you, like, modeling now? Do you think I can? That's not what I'm trying to say, Cal. -I'm trying to get-- -No, I know. I-- okay. Let me, like, break it down. It's-- it was, like, for art, you know what I mean? Like, it was an art project that I got to be a part of and, like-- I just... You just what? You're sacrificing one thing for the other. Why are you concerned? No, I'm not. No, I'm not sacrificing anything. - It's, like, all related. - But you are. - No, I'm not. Not at all. - Yes, you are. You're just botched your audition because you were out drinking with Em. It wasn't that bad. It's just-- I don't think you understand, I feel like-- I'm not getting it. Explain it to me. It's pretty important to align yourself with successful people. Like, how else... do you know-- I don't understand why-- Oh, now I get it. No, that was clear. That was crystal clear. That-- like, that fell right in. -Yeah. -Bobby. No, you're right. If you gotta-- you got-- you should go hang out with Em more, I guess. I don't know, I'm sorry I'm not a photographer. Oh, my God. You're being so dramatic. -I'm not being dramatic. -You are! It's just-- it's really frustrating that you're coming to me and you're complaining about not having your shit together and you're not working on your shit. I am working on my shit. How are you working on your shit? Every single fucking day I'm working on it. I need to go get a burger, like, very desperately because I fucking don't feel well.

Everyone loves this one. There was one year a bunch of friends and I went to Cabo for spring break. -Oh! -And it was basically, just me and seven girls -sobbing the entire time. -Why? Well, just for various reasons. Like, the first night, I ended up eating something, and, like, was vomiting my guts out for the entire night. My roommate thought someone had died. - And, um, so then-- - What did you eat? Tacos, I guess. - Cal, hi! - Hi, baby. Hi. - This is amazing. - Oh, I know. You came! Oh, my gosh. - I ran, but I came. - Thank you. -You're a sweaty boy. -I'm a sweaty boy, babes. Honey, do you have a shirt with you? Yeah, but it's hot, I was busking all day, -and you know-- -I know. I know. And then, I ran here, and the trains were late, but I'm here, and I'm here with you. -Yes, do you want-- -I thought you'd be happy. Baby, do you wanna put your shirt on? 'Cause the AC is blaring in here. I could, yeah, you don't have to fan me. I could. Where's the bathroom? Right there, um, do you want me - to, um, carry your-- - No, it's fine. I'm good. You're an insane-- Anyway, she ended up breaking up with her boyfriend. - Really? - That was-- that was very good. She did? In a good-- like, a good way? -I missed a lot-- -Yes, you did. -Okay, you guys. -She definitely needed to do it. There's an amazing bar around-- like, around the corner-ish. -I'm gonna call us a Lyft. -Great. Do you want-- do you wanna go? Yeah, I could use a drink. I'm gonna call the-- he's a minute away! Okay, I'm gonna go stand in the street. -Let's go. -Thank you, baby. Let's go, Kit. Do you wanna come out? - I'll meet you outside. - I'm gonna flag him down. -You coming? -Yes. Um, I'll meet you out there, okay? Alrighty. I'll see you out there. See you out there. Hi. Babe? Give-- give me a second, Cal. - Jesus, I-- - Okay. - But I really have to go. - You literally just told me to change, and I'm changing. No, I know, but I really have to go. Cal, I'll be out in like, a minute. - I know. I'll fucking leave. - I'll be right there. I'll text you, okay? I love you. - I gotta go. I gotta go. - Cal? Hey, off we go. The jumpsuit was ruined? -Oh, I mean-- -No, you washed that. -You washed that. -I have seen her wear it multiple times. Every time I pee myself, I just immediately wash my pants. You do that, like, really fast. Yeah, no, she still wears it. -Oh, God. -It's a jumpsuit. I mean, I wouldn't throw it out. -Yeah, right? -Wash it. - Trauma. Yeah. - I'd wash it, but-- -Oh, my God. -I assumed she did. Can I get you another one? -Please. That'd be great. -Okay. Um, you guys, I'm gonna get us shots. Tequila. -I love that. -Great, lady. -Great. -Yes. Celebrate. - Here you go. - Thank you. Of course. -Cheers. -Cheers. Jacob, I know you're not doing another shot, but I got you another whiskey. - Wow. That's incredible. - I know. I know, but... we gotta get to "piss my pants" level. I didn't know we were doing shots. Oh, my God! -You just gotta drink. -Here is to Emily. Who gives a shit. Who gives a shit. To Emily on her big day. To you, guys. Thank you for being here. -To Emily. -I love you, guys. Cheers, cheers, cheers. Ooh. I don't-- I don't know where my drink went, but... I should have left-- I should have left - about an hour ago, I-- - Okay. Go. Oh, yeah. Don't-- please don't do this. Don't do this right here. -Please. -But like, you're not gonna-- Yeah, that happens all the time. I need you to-- can you just stay for, like, 15 minutes? - We'll all go. - Yikes. Yeah. They argue a lot. Yeah. But anyway, so... This girl's ferret was so fucking big. I'm gonna head out. Um, okay. Yeah, I just have an early morning, so, I gotta go. - But, uh, I'll see you tomorrow? - Yeah. -I'll see you at home. -Cool. -You okay? -Yeah. No, I'm fine. I just have to be up for the callback -in the morning. -Let's hang this week, okay? - Yeah, let's do it. - Okay. - All right, bye, girls. - Love you. You too. - Hi. - Hi. Are we getting drunky? Um, four shots, please. Here we go. -Four. -Four. I would, um... I would go to, like, the tea shop, and get three samples of tea. - I remember so distinctly. - Yep. Three samples of tea, drink it and be like, - "I'm full." - "I'm so full." "I don't need-- I'm good." Yeah, I mean, that's-- So fucked up. And we convince ourselves of that. - Oh, totally. - Like it's fucking-- Totally. I still-- I mean obviously, it's a-- it's a lifelong-- - it's a lifelong thing. - Yeah. - But-- - It's bullshit. - Mm-hmm. - You like, finish a meal now, -and it's like-- -You're like, "Ah." -Yeah. -'Cause they tell you you're not supposed to eat everything -on your plate or whatever. -Which is bullshit. Like, if you're hungry, just fucking eat. Right. It's crazy. -It is crazy. -And to like, not be able to, -like, trust your hunger, right? -Right. Right. Freaking insane. Um, hmm. Are you going to this party on Saturday? -Adrian's party? -The one on Long Island, yeah. Yeah. Woman, what? I don't know. I don't know. All right. Okay. -Okay. -I don't know. I was thinking of going. Who is bothering me? Oh! -Hello. -Jay? Hi. No, I'm with Cal. Yeah. Well, how long will you be, 'cause-- Yeah, if we ordered Indian, do you think you could pick it up and bring it over? Okay. Okay. Yeah. Right. I love you. Bye. -Yes? -He... well, we are going to order Indian food, and he's going to pick it up... -Amazing. -...for us. -Is he coming over? -Yeah. All right. In college, I took this class on, um, modern art and, um, like, monochromatic art. -Oh, shit. -And how, like, texture informs the piece, right? -It's very cool. -So like, it's not just, like, a red painting. -The texture of this painting. -Right, it is the texture of-- And how it reflects against the room. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. -And I-- before that, I was like, "This is not art." Yeah, like, it's creating environment, which I feel like is-- but I keep-- I keep going to these things where it's, like, it's a-- a hat, but like, here's the opinion -about it that makes it art. -Right. -And I don't know that I-- -This is not a pipe. Right, but that, I-- I understand. -I love that. -It's-- I love that. -That's just like-- -Um. Guys, if I'm being honest, I kinda thought that you might have got something for me. Well, you were just at your parents. -You ate lunch with them. -Okay, it's dinner now. I'm just-- you know, I had like, a long commute and-- Baby, you can have-- here, have this. -We have so much. -Okay. -Share-- share with me. -Yeah. Share. I'm putting so much of this. - It's so good. - I mean-- We're two. We're two people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's for two. Yeah, it's-- I'm eating all of this. I'm just gonna grab this spoon. Oh, I just licked it. That's fine, I think we're okay with that, right? -Oh, my God. -Yeah. I guess so. Um, how are your parents, by the way? -They, um-- -Haven't seen them in a minute. -They're all right. -Just all right? Yeah, you know, I think we're just, like, getting to the point where we just, like, realize that our parents, like, have these flaws. Yeah, but we're all flawed. Yeah, but they're just, like, not doing anything to change it. Like they-- they're-- they have these flaws, and they're very aware of them, but they just-- No, I get it. I get it, but like... should they? Do you know what I mean? Like, should they? But do you think that we should, like, just, like, settle for mediocrity? No, I-- but I also, don't think having flaws -makes someone mediocre. -That's not what I'm saying. -I'm just saying that-- -But you're implying it in a sense, right? No, I'm just saying, like, we should always be striving to improve ourselves, and, um-- I feel like that would be exhausting. Hi, Dad. Uh, good, I'm, uh, just, uh, home applying backstage stuff. Mm-hmm. Yeah, and then, I'm-- um, I'm gonna go to a friend's in a bit. Yes. Okay, and I know-- I know I have to call her. I told you I would. I literally said I would. And I told you I was gonna call her and I am. Oh, my God. And I will. All right? I have to go. Oh, fucking God. I'm walking the wrong direction. -Do you want more? -Mm-hmm. -Thank you. -Sure. That's probably good. It's a nice big glass of wine. Heavy pour. That's, like, right up my alley. Great. Mmm. -What? -Nothing. You are... very impressive. - I was being sincere. - Thanks. You're welcome. I don't know, especially, like... you've accomplished so much. And, like, oh, God, especially, in regards to, like-- like, obviously, I know you and Jay had very different family upbringings. And you've both accomplished, like... so much, it's-- it's super impressive. Mmm. Yeah, I love Jacob. He's a sensitive little boy. This is Bobby Cortez. Leave it here. The longest I ever drove, I actually didn't pee for 13 and a half hours. - What? - Oh, my God, I just ran a stop sign. I got excited. But I didn't pee the whole time. I was so proud of myself. Why did we decide to get 40 bottles of Margarita Mix? I don't know. That's how much we needed. I mean, fair. Hello? Ooh, can you - get this for me please, Cal? - Yes. Thank you. Hit that doorbell. - Hi. - Hello. Hi, so happy you guys made it. How are you? Thank you for having us. Of course, come on in. Your brother texted me requesting the entire - Frito-Lay aisle, so we got it. - Wow. We went on a spree. We did just go food shopping, but this is great. -You good? -Yep. Here, here. Let me take that. Oh, thank you. Is-- is he-- -Yeah, uh, right in the kitchen. -Okay, cool. -Hey. -Hi. Happy you made it. Here. Let me get the door. Oh, such chivalry. Here, tag team. -Nice. -Bam. What's he like in class? Like, what does he-- does he talk or... I don't know, he's like-- Is he, like, talking to other students, - or like, just like-- - No, he's just... Hi, babe, hi. - ...sarcastic and like-- - Oh, that-- that-- that tracks, actually. I'm-- I'm Emily. I'm Jacob's girlfriend. - Nice to meet you. - Hey, nice to meet you. -Ah. -Show me. -Four wing Three. -Ooh. -What does that mean? -Okay. Don't look. -Special? -Don't look. Don't look. -Am I special? -An individualist. -Okay. I like that. -"Uh, they want to express themselves and their individuality to create and surround themselves with beauty." Why are you saying it like that? Really funny 'cause it's really cheesy. -It checks, though. -Yeah, it does? -Yeah, I like beauty. -Okay, that fits. It's kind of a boring job, but-- - What are the perks? - Well, like-- The firm just hooked me up with this, like, -really sick apartment. -Are you kidding? - Yeah. - Really? - Where? - It's in LIC. - That's where I am. - It's pretty nice, right? Yeah, that's, like, a hidden gem. -Like, not for long, yeah? -Well... Like, you just got that amazing tour. - Right? Like, that's amazing. - Dude! -Hey. -I almost accidentally cockblocked your brother. Cool, um, that's-- that's great, Dan, uh-- "We need to take care of our emotional needs..." -Emily! -"...before attending to anything else." Oh, interesting. Come on. "...to create an identity." - Emily! - Um... I gotta go to the bathroom really quick. -Okay. -Okay. -I'll be back in a second. -All right. Emily, can we talk? Can you just give me a minute? - Jacob. - Hey, can you please just come out of the bathroom? I'm not coming out right now. Can you just fucking give me a minute, please? Thank you. Okay. Emily? Hi. Hey. I thought-- I thought you gave that to Em. Uh, no, no, I just, uh-- I just got her her own. Oh. Oh, my God, I haven't been in this room... ...in ages. Yeah. - It's been a while. - Oh, my God. Oh. Hello. - Oh, our little hands. - Mm-hmm. What does BFFR mean? -Did we mean "BFFL"? -Really? What? You-- "best friends for real"? Come on. That was our thing. - Sorry. - I forgive you. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. Um, hmm. We were very, um... - weird. - Totally weird. - Yes. Cute. - Very cute. - Adorable, in fact. - Mostly weird. More-- more cute than weird. That was cute. We were usually weird. I think the ratio can be, uh... I don't know. I... can't remember-- I can't remember the last time that we were alone. - That's weird. - Hmm. -Yeah. That is weird. -Hmm. Kinda makes me sad. Same. How is Emily? She is-- she is-- she's-- she's going to be fine, yeah. - That was very convincing. - She's-- -she's gonna be fine. -Beautiful performance. They pay to act? Do you know, surprisingly, they do. -Weird. -Very odd. How are you, my love? I am, uh... -I'm good. -Oh. I'm real good. Yeah. Crushing it. Let's talk about something else. Please. All right. I wanna talk about-- hey, babe. I wanna talk about anything with you. -Yeah? -Yeah, so you, uh, you can take the lead. -That's... -Don't fuck my brother. ...really hot. You think so? I can't even see you. I don't wanna look at that. Why do you own these? -Where did they come from? -You know... you know, I got really into Hellboy, and these reminded me. You know, I think I remember that phase. Yeah. It was a fun phase. I kinda miss those days. Let me see. I'm curious. Ooh, it's gonna be your next Halloween costume, I think. Are you into it? I kind of see you. -You look really close to me. -Yeah, do I? -Well, maybe 'cause I am. Yeah. -Yes, 'cause you are. Um. You're dumb. What do you wanna talk about? Hmm... -How about... -How about? Please, don't fuck my brother. Oh, okay. We're back on that. -Yeah. -Okay. Hmm. I'll, um, see your brother, and raise you a girlfriend. -Would that be better? -Oh, no! -Is that more preferable? -No, that's so much worse. -Less? It's worse? Oh, man. -Actually, yeah. No, it-- -Not ideal? -Not-- definitely not ideal. -Both situations. -Okay, cool. What would be... ideal? You know, I feel like I keep disappointing people. I don't think you're disappointing people. No, I am, it's fine. I think that people have really big expectations for you. -Well-- no, I just-- I-- -And-- It's-- I just should've told Emily sooner. We could have avoided this entire fucking thing. What are you talking about? What did you-- what didn't you-- what did you do? What did you do? I got the tour. -Yeah. -Wow. Mm-hmm. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! -I know. I'm excited! -That is so huge, dude! It's gonna be-- it's gonna be good. Oh, my God. That amazing. It's gonna be a good year. It's gonna be a fucking a-- amazing year. -Yeah. -That's so good. This is so good. Wow. Thanks, Cal. Everything else will figure itself out. -Yeah. -And the people that love you will be here when you get back. -Okay. -Which you'll come back. I will. I will come back. He always does. -Um-- -I miss you. Well... -I miss you a lot. -I miss you too. I miss you. I'm... um... so, here's the thing. I miss you, like... All the time. Yeah, like, every single day. -And I wanna talk to you... -All the time. Yeah, literally, all the time. I just-- I don't know. I-- I wish... I, um, haven't made eye contact with you in this long, it's, like, a bit jarring. -I-- -Why? I don't know, I just haven't, like... we haven't, like, looked into each other's eyes in a moon. Yeah, it's been kinda... it's been kinda hard to. Fair. I-- - Um... - Um... Um, I, uh-- - Wait. - I-- I-- I-- Yeah. - I-- I should-- - Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. - Jay, hold on. - I should see -what's going on with Emily. -Wait, Jay! - Can you, please, wait. - She's in the bathroom. Yeah, I understand. Can you just wait one second? I gotta check on her. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Come here. Come here. Come here. Are you okay? Are you okay? Yeah. Ew. Oh, fuck. You look great. -I love you. -I love you, too. I'm in love with you. I love you so much. I-- I have to go. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. You're back. You wanna keep, uh-- I can keep reading the thing. I know you did leave mid-sentence last time, and I was worried that I fucked something up, but... -No, it's all good. -...we can keep reading -if you want. -No, let's go get a drink. And then, you can tell me more about me. Okay. Oh! Why do we do this to ourselves? so good. - What? - I'm just gonna-- I don't know. We're going in for-- oh, my God, wait for-- - You're crazy. - Yeah, that's-- Uh, hey, you've reached Jacob. I'm not here right-- Hi, this is Emily Elizabeth Walker. I'm not here to answer the phone right now-- Could you please take your dirty feet off the dashboard? My feet aren't dirty. - Your shoes are dirty. - They're not dirty. They're new. -How could you afford new shoes? -Because I work? -I work two jobs. -Okay. I'm glad. Excuse me? All I said is, "Okay. I'm glad." I hope you have two jobs. I want you to work hard. I am working hard. How do you have time to hang out with your friends all the time? Do you want me to not have friends? You want me to just go to work, and come home, and, like... be a robot and, like, what, go to a-- what do you want from me? -Don't put words in my mouth. -I'm not putting words in your mouth, that's what you said. How do I have time to hang out with my friends? I want you to work hard and succeed. I am working hard. Dad, I literally just graduated. I-- I know. I was there. Do you know how hard it is? Yeah, I really do -understand how hard it is. -Do not patronize me, please. You just sound like you're patronizing me. -I'm not patronizing. -You are, Dad! You have no idea. -No, I really do understand. -No, Dad. But you don't, because you have this fucking-- Dad, you have this, like, 9 to 5 job. And you have this family and your house, and you get to, like, go to work and come home, and eat Panera Bread, and watch Dancing with the Stars. And like, I'm working all the time. I work literally all the time. -I'm exhausted. -You think I don't work hard? Who do you think pays for everything? Dad, it's not about you! -Okay, honey. -Can you not? Honey, just relax. I'm fucking-- Dad. I'm sad. Thank you. Call me if you need anything. - I love you. - love you too. Can I have $20? This is Bobby Cortez. Leave it here. Okay, so when you're ready, I'm going to ask everyone to stand up from their chairs. You are going to pick a partner, and go to sit somewhere in the room facing your partner. Do you wanna-- Um, yeah, sure. Just look at the person in front of you. Just look at them. This person doesn't expect anything from you. Just look. Just notice. No judgements. Take them in. Thank you so much for setting this up. - Thank you for coming. - Please let me know - when the next is. - I will, promise, 100%. -Have a good night. -You, too. You were amazing. Thank you. Um... Are those both for you, or are you gonna-- No, I'm not that selfish. -Really? -Surprisingly. I'm not too sure about that. I'm so-- I'm so sorry. I fucked up.
