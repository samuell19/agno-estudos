Every girl wanted to ride in that convertible. That Skyline was red and white, and... Except Susie, she didn't like Frankie. But, he didn't care, he knew he was gonna date her. One day, Frankie and I go into Pop's Soda Shop, and there's Susie in there, Peggy Sue sitting at a booth. We saunter up. They're looking pretty as can be. Quit daydreaming Rocky, let's go!

Someone please wake me up from this nightmare! - Sorry! Dad warned me about the voltage regulator. - Like I care! Push this heap of junk out of here now! - Rufus and the guys better get here soon. Yeah, so... - Do you have to do that? - Sorry, so I'm nervous, I would sing it but, I thought it might bother you. It's just a silly song my grandpa sang. I don't know why I sing it.

Don't let him push this here button! They've come back. - Back? - About 30 years ago, Martians came for our women. Took 10. Something about repopulating their planet, or some cockamamie story like that. I imagine they've come for 10 more. Took my Millie. I still have nightmares of them Martian freaks on top of my Millie. - If it's any consolation sir, they probably use this new scientific technique I've been reading about. - What the hell are you talking about? - It's not the birds and the bees thing, they use science.
