(LOCK BUZZES) If I'm wanted, I'll be down in the counting house. You still think I'm the sexiest beast since Errol Flynn? WOMAN: Who's Errol Flynn? "Who's Errol Flynn?" Shit. MAN 1: New batch for the branches. MAN 2: Over here, mate. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Yeah, 100 don't even look like that down here. -Thank you. -(LAUGHING) Watch your hands. (INTERCOM BUZZES) -Yes? -Conway. (LOCK BUZZES) All right, I think there's a copy of that in here. There's two of them to fix, I think. -G'day, fellas. -G'day, Robbie. -G'day, Robbie. -You happy? BOTH: Yeah. (MURMURING INDISTINCTLY) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) -DISPATCHER: Security check. -Yup, we're onto it. Righto. -DISPATCHER: Security check. -Yeah, clear, boss. VH-2DA, Car 22 to base. Come in, 22. Listen, Eric, we're leaving the Central Bank now. Arrival should be schedule minus five, okay? Right. Attention, counting house dispatch, convoy has left the Central Bank five minutes early. First van should arrive at 12:25 hours. (HORN HONKING) (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) (HORN HONKS) (RADIO CHATTER CONTINUES) (WHIRRING) (LOCK BUZZES) What's the intake? -Only about six million. -(MAN COUGHS) Relax. Lionel Darcy reckons the security here is tighter than a fish's bum. -See you. -Yeah, right. (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) Twenty-two to base. Come in, 22. Approaching counting house now, base. Roger, 22. Help me out, Gloria, will you? (BUZZES OPEN) -(LOCK BUZZING) -Hello. Morning, ladies. G'day, Cullen. Don't let any bloke see my machine guns. -G'day. -How are you? (MAN COUGHING) Okay, here's the first one. Press the hatch button. Jesus, five minutes early. -That's a bit of a change for you buggers. -BRIAN: Yeah? It's all right for you fucking armchair drivers. -Seen any bunny rabbits lately, mate? -Just the one. Watch out, mate. MAN: (ON RADIO) Halfway through the bank run. Location as usual. DISPATCH: Yeah, righty-oh. (STOPS ENGINE) (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) Jesus, hot as buggery in there, I could do with a drink. -Tell me something new. -(BELL RINGING) Thought you were chatting up the barmaid in this place. Get in her purse, you reckon? -Yeah, found out her husband's been passing the bottle about. -(LAUGHS) (CHATTING INDISTINCTLY) (RADIO CHATTER CONTINUES) -Oh, g'day, Nacker. -Hey. You still pinching meat? Come on, Dick, the job's gotta have a few perks. A nice big leg of lamb here, Dick. Just the feel of it will make any bugger randy. (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) I'm getting a bit sick of lamb, Nacker. Haven't you got any steak? I've got a nice sirloin from a two-year-old Hereford. Lovely. You could've eaten him out of the paddock. Give me 10 minutes, mate. I'm concerned, Connor, concerned about powder-puff penalties. There's far too much talk these days about the rights of criminals, stop. How about the rights of security patrolman, who are mugged after dark, semi-colon, no make that a question mark. -(KNOCKING) -Come in! And what about armored-car drivers... Sorry to interrupt, but I thought... Yes, all right. Thank you very much, Maureen. Thank you. (TAPE WHIRRING) ...security patrolman, who are mugged after dark, semi-colon, no make that a question mark. Come in! And what about the rights armored-car drivers... MAN: Did you hear about the Irish astronauts, -that decided to go to the sun instead of the moon. -No, I haven't. Well, they decided to go to the sun, you see, and this bloke said, "You can't go to the sun, you'd just burn up." -They said, "That's all right, we'll go at night." -(LAUGHING) Inside! Quick! Quick! -Okay, get inside! -Get in quick! Go on then! In the box! Inside! (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) Enough! (GRUNTS) Hurry up now, guys. -(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) -(LOCK BUZZES) WOMAN: Hello, girls! Come on, come on. (STARTING ENGINE) Hey, Dick! Hey, Dick! I've got... (TIRES SQUEALING) Stay within the speed limits. -Sure. -Take your mask off! Darcy's Control, Eric Jackson. WOMAN: Service 10, Control. MAN: (ON RADIO) Service 10, go. David, one of the vans has been hit. Tell Mr. Darcy, he's on the firing range. ERIC: Right. (SIRENS WAILING) (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) Get right back there. Right back. -Who is he, Sergeant? -No idea, I'm afraid. -Any witnesses? -I don't think so. This lot arrived as they drove off. They had a cream Holden station wagon. No one got the number. See if Darcy's got a key to this thing. Your motto has to be "eternal vigilance." Constant suspicion. That big bloke at the factory entrance, wasn't he there yesterday? That gray car. Where have I seen that before? Ask yourself these questions every... (TIRES SCREECHING) A hundred and fifty grand, eh, Ben? -Oh, 150 each! Not bad for five minutes work. -(LAUGHING) -Ten, mate! Ten! -Okay, ten! -(GUNSHOT6) -(SCREAMS) Dino! -(GUNSHOTS) -(GRUNTING) Yes, very good, Dino. Clothes, passport, first-class air ticket to Tehran. Here's some cash in US dollars to go on with. Your share of today is 40%. Mr. Henderson said it'll be forwarded to you in Iranian rials, in about a week. The cost of all this stuff will be deducted from your percentage. Good businessman, Mr. Henderson. Yes, that's right. Strictly a businessman. Jesus, Dick Martin. Give these fellas a hand. Here you go. Good. Give us a hand with it. Come on. Take it easy. Come on. You get a look on him, Dick? No. Not much of a look at all. Will you get those people back? Will you get those people back there? The driver, as you can see, there's quite a lot of blood on his head, there. Looks like they hit him. (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) CAMPBELL: Patrol to 9, 1, 2, 3. Location... Thank you, Mrs. Campbell. Gentlemen. For what we are about to receive, the Lord make us truly thankful, Amen. -Amen. -Right. Do you know what happens now? Legal and United are going to put our insurance premiums up. One more little robbery like today's and we're going to be out of business. -Come on, it's the lunch break. -He's right, Mr. Darcy. If the men are on the road after 12:00, the unions insist on a lunch break. Then ram this robbery down the union's throat. After today's little farce, they're gonna have to make a deal. Yeah, but what about this? Oh, some kid watching too much TV. Check it out as much as you can, will you? And listen, you remember that cashier we had for 10 years? Started shoving $50 bills in his boot. And that's not where the lady cashiers used to put them. Jackson, that fellow that got trussed up with a leg of lamb today. Dick Martin, you know him? Only been with the armored cars a few months, but seemed okay. Most of these old ex-coppers aren't worth feeding, frankly. Listen, why don't we get some of the younger blokes, ex-Vietnam boys? I don't know, sir, the police take the view they're trigger happy. Another problem there too. They, um, they wouldn't pass the CPI test. Huh? What the hell is that? Oh, you've authorized it, sir. The American system I instituted. You see, we grade them one to five, on the basis of 400 questions. -Now grades one and two are reject. -Oh. They're too intelligent, they get bored of the job. See, you got to fail the entry exam to be able to work here. MAN: Yes. Detective Sergeant Rose, Hold-up Squad. MAN: Look at the video monitor please, sir. It might be possible to rob a van on the road Detective Sergeant, but this area is impregnable. You reckon? Call me Sammy. The doors wouldn't be raised for any unauthorized vehicle, we're in radio contact with all our vans. Yeah, what if someone stole one of those tin cans and just drove it in here? It wouldn't make any difference. It wouldn't be on the roster, Mr. Ross. Sammy. And if it is not rostered, it doesn't get in. Yeah? I always work on the assumption though, that any bloke that wants to knock off a place like this doesn't have to break in. -He works here. -(BUZZES) This little lot would tempt Jesus Christ. -Crap. -Maybe. But what sort of security man could afford not to take it seriously. This one. I reckon you ought to check out anyone that joined Darcy's in the past couple of months. My security screening system is... Oh, come on David. Your bloody security system's not worth a crumpet if some bloke slips past and does the place over. I don't think I need you to teach me my job, Detective Sergeant Rose. Where did you get him from? Darcy dug him up somewhere. He used to be over the police force in Ulster, or London, or Cornshire, or somewhere, I don't know. You certainly gave him the shits. Yeah. All right, you got rid of him. Now what? -No fooling you, mate. -Better believe it. Couple of things I might be able to follow up on that, uh, on the job today. Glad to hear it. -This too. -Hmm? I know few people who tell me things. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Might be a bit costly. Oh... Not real orthodox though. We'll meet once a month and exchange notes. Jesus, you better be good. Can I use your phone? (PHONE RINGING) Yes? That detective again, wants to know about the Darcy job. Tell him. Hmm. We heard a rumor that Tony Duggan and a man called Ben Lancer were involved. Darcy's have had a note threatening the counting house. We have no knowledge of that. A counting house, Ernest, we should find out about that. If someone's planning to take it, they might need our help. There you are. You don't get contacts like that hanging around Sunday school. See you in church. (MAN COUGHING) (DOOR OPENS) Leave us alone, will you? Security business. -You know anything? -(TURNS ON RADIO) -Of course. Someone's on to us. -Oh, what? Security's got a note saying the counting house is going off. -Any names? -No. Well, what are you worrying about? Fuck me, it's probably just some ratbags, they get them all the time. But what if there is someone else? I've been planning this job for five years, five! And I don't want it fouled up by some half-wit getting in before us. Or any 18-year-old tart who's been listening to you talk in your sleep. You're not the only one that's been sitting around for five years, you know. By the time you're ready, we'll be rushing into the bloody counting house in wheelchairs. We go when I say, could be another six months. Gear's not ready and I still haven't worked out how to fix the van rosters. Oh, Jesus Christ. If you think it's such a pushover, why don't you ring Lionel Darcy and ask him to drop the 20 million dollars around here, save us a lot of travel! What's this lot, Ed? (SIGHS) Group of new recruits. Security wants me to run a field check. (CHUCKLES) They reckon one of this mob might be planning it. Anything in it? I doubt it. This bloke's a bit of a weirdo, Leo Bassett. * (CHUCKLES) Looks like he couldn't fight his way out of a light fog. What are you gonna do about him? Push him a bit. See how he shapes up. What if you reckon he's planning something? Tell security, and they can get rid of him for us. Hmm. What if he comes up clean? Still tell them to keep an eye on him. Better him than us. Mmm-hmm. -You know him? -I've seen him round, he's on night patrols. Bugger comes to work in a Jag. Apart from the fact that he looks like a poofter, what made you pick on him? Look under interests. Music, poetry? -He is a poofter. -Mmm-mmm, got the address. Kathmandu Towers. (CHUCKLES) Bit flash. -(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) -(DOG BARKING) (CLANGING) -See when I... -(SCREAM) You know what you do in a situation like this? You swing the stiff arm around like this, knock the gun aside, then hit him with the other fist. -Didn't you read your instruction manual. -Yes, sir. Security officers are to seal gates and doors behind them. Sealed means locked. -Yeah, I'm sorry sir. (STUTTERS) -What else? -Else? -Else! (STUTTERING) What else did I do wrong? You called me "sir" and you don't even know who the hell I am. I could have killed senior supervisor Eric Jackson ten minutes ago and taken his uniform. -Yes, I'm sorry. -Well? Well, may I see your identification please. Better. (PANTING) -What's your mother's middle name? -Why? -Quick, quick! -(INDISTINCT SHOUTING) Like the job, Leo? Oh, it's okay. Bit early to tell. Pay's a bit lousy. Listen, you slave your guts out for five years, they make you a supervisor. Yeah. You like driving Leo? -I hear you've got a Jag. -Yes. -Well, I've seen you drive. -Have you? I thought I'd been forgotten, where was that? Oh, at the Liverpool Raceway. -I was there the night that Peter Romano got killed. -Peter? Oh, yeah. I told him it was dodgy, cutting in on me on the top corner. (BEEPS) Control to Car 16. -Car 16. -Attend your code 180. I have a break at this time. Roger. Here's your big chance, Leo. Well, it's probably just another false alarm, I hope. -For Christ's sake! -MAN: Will you get this fucking thing started! (ENGINE CRANKING) ERIC: There they are. (HORN HONKS) LEO: Shit! (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (ALARM RINGING) (GRUNTING) I'm out of here, fuck this! You bastard! (POLICE SIREN WAILING) I measure our success by a low profile. And what do you do, huh? You get yourself on the front page. Well, what have you got to say for yourself. It's a hell of an old photo. Why couldn't you wait for the police, huh? You're supposed to protect property, not destroy it. If I had of waited, sir, those kids would have got away. Besides, David asked me to check out a new recruit. Leo Bassett. That's right, Mr. Darcy, over the counting house note. Bassett? What's supposed to be wrong with him? Oh, he's a sort of intellectual type, sir. Keeps to himself, but I don't think he's as naive as he makes out. You're a good security man, Jackson. But you over-played your hand last night. I don't favor the James Bond tactics. (SIGHS) Oh, take a couple of weeks off until this thing blows over. Don't talk to the media! You were 24 years with the police force. You were awarded commendation for bravery and you were the captain of the police pistol team. Why were you dismissed? I resigned. It's all in the file. Come on, Mr. Martin. It was your career and career policemen do not resign. Well, the branch had SP blokes in a whole lot of pubs paying them behind the door. Bribes? You were a policeman, Mr. Griffiths, you know how the system works. Well, they sent me around one Saturday to check one out. Someone had tipped off Internal Affairs. As soon as this bookie came up to me and gave me the envelope, they had me on toast. And you had been sharing in the bribes from the bookmakers? Well, I guess the odd 50 bucks came my way. Sort of an unofficial license. Very public spirited. But why did your colleagues inform on you? Well, it wasn't all of them. Just one. He was planning a couple of little deals I wouldn't go along with, so he set me up. And you mentioned all this at the enquiry. Nah, no point. I just drifted into the security business, like a lot of rejects. Discipline is the name of the game, Bobby. Some of our men get around with their shirts hanging out, buttons undone. In fact they're getting so damned careless... -Okay, okay. -...they forget to zip up their flies. You've got Buckley's chance of getting all this passed by the union. You tell them, if there is another robbery around here they'll all finish up bouncing drunks out of pubs. What about Martin, Mr. Darcy? Who the hell is Martin? Thanks, John. -The driver in that leg of lamb job. -(BUZZES) You're in charge of security, what do you suggest? I think he should be dismissed. Who, Martin? He failed to survey the area properly and his heroics were childish. Look, Lionel, Martin's all right. I knew him when he was with the division. DAVID: I still say he ought to go. At least, he had a go at those blokes. And the final analysis, we still need men. Get rid of the other two, and put him on night patrol for a while. He won't be the first ex-cop that's had a second chance at Darcy's. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (COMMENTATOR CHATTING ON PA) (ENGINE REVVING) How about that patrolman you gave a ride through the window? Bassett? Huh! Scared him to death. He's harmless. Yeah, well, Lionel Darcy isn't. They've got the wind up over that van job. There'll be that many regulations, you'll need a passport and six keys to get into the shithouse. Can't you stop them through the union? Oh, some of it. We're gonna have to make a move. It's not getting any easier. (ENGINES REVVING) Need cash, that's the problem. Few things to buy. I've got a couple of thousand. Not enough, Ed. I got some leave. I'll sort it out. -Good bye, darling. -(DOG WHIMPERS) Be a good boy. Mummy won't be long. Mrs. Hawkins is going to feed you. -Oh, Eric, couldn't we take him? -(STARTS ENGINE) We will be back Thursday, Mrs. Hawkins. RADIO DJ: Time to take another caller on the boogey line. Hello, are you there? Hello, are you there? I know you're there, I can hear you sneezing. WOMAN: Hello. DJ: Hello, who's that? WOMAN: Judy here, Tony. DJ: Hi, Judy... (DUCKS QUACKING) Eric, do you remember before we were married, that weekend we went up to the beach house that you borrowed? Mummy found out about it, was so shocked. Yes, she wasn't one of my greatest fans. You didn't make much of an effort. She didn't understand about racing cars and all that sort of thing. No, but that didn't stop her nagging me into giving it all up. You used to think it was worth it. MAN: Leo Bassett! Richard Martin. O'Neil. (CLOSES DOOR) (STARTS ENGINE) (DOG BARKING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) I've been waiting for you for an hour. -What? -I work here. I was on late shift and I left my purse inside and it's got my money and my keys and everything. -Can I see your Velva permit card, miss? -Ah, yes. Sorry. Oh, here it is. -Mindel? -Seagers. Well, I'm sorry, Miss Seagers, I still can't let you in. I only patrol this factory, I don't have the keys. -Oh, could you give me a lift? -No, not possible. I'm sorry, it's the patrol company rules... Oh, go on. It's only mile away. Yeah, okay. Well, I guess I'll be by this way, at least four times tonight, anyway. Great job. You could just go home and go to sleep and nobody would ever know. Yeah. Doesn't quite work that way. Well, some places we have to punch in time... (CLATTERING) (WOMAN MOANING) (MAN GRUNTING) (OPENS DOOR) -Hey! -(SCREAMS) -(INDISTINCT SHOUTING) -Shut up! -(GRUNTS) -Open the safe. There's no safe in here. Touch that alarm and I'll blow your head off. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (CLATTERING) (GRUNTING) I don't know what you're so worried about. You're only giving me lift home. Well, I've only been there a little while, they're always checking up on me. How long have you been there? -A month. -Oh. Bloody thing. -Is there a caretaker? -(CHUCKLES) No, not here. Have you got a hair pin or a nail file in your bag? (SIGHS) Look, go to the flat downstairs and see if you can borrow their keys. -Well, sometimes they work. -Okay. There isn't anybody... You're a genius. How did you do it? Well, I just... -What's your name? -Leo Bassett. Well, Leo. Come in and have a drink. Oh! No, thanks. I've got to finish the rounds. Maybe some other night. Yeah. Look, call in. I'm usually home after 6:00. -Okay, I will. -Bye, Leo. -Thanks again. -Bye. Okay. (CHATTER ON POLICE RADIOS) MAN: I'm sorry, sir. I'm so sorry... -Sorry, sir, no one allowed inside. -It's all right, mate. -I'm from Darcy's. -No. No one at all. -Do you want to patrol or be a taxi driver? -(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Sammy, tell this bloke, for Christ's sake, who I am. It's all right. It's the sales man from Darcy's. I suppose this girl that Mr. Bassett escorted does work here? Miss Seagers? Oh, yes, for a few weeks, I've seen her around. Somebody tell me something. -Your base sent out a supervisor. -John Dolan. After this bloke shot through with a bit of crumpet, someone hit Dolan over the head. Excuse me. And tied these two up, while they were... -Working late. -Yeah. And did the safe, $50,000. Well, where's Dolan? Did you get a doctor? It's a bit late for that. -(SIRENS WAILING) -(CAMERA CLICKING) Jesus Christ. The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want * He makes me down to lie * In pastures green, He leadeth me... * Police, now believe, that the killer of patrol man, John Dolan, is or was an employee of Darcy's Security Services. As he actually had information about payroll deliveries to Velva Cosmetics. Darcy's executives, not surprisingly, won't comment. But my information is that... * Shall surely follow me * And in God's house forevermore * My dwelling place shall be (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Okay, let's get Darcy if we can, up this way. -Hope you got what you need. -Eh? -The job. -What do you mean? -Dolan. -Yeah. It was an accident. Yeah, when you're in the shit up to here, it doesn't matter how you got there, does it? Dick. -How's it going? -Oh, real good, Sammy. Always wanted to spend the nights running around factories. You still winning a lot of money off horses you didn't back? I've told you before, Dick, it wasn't me who set you up in that pub. Geez! -I always thought you were the best bloke in the squad. -Yeah. You just couldn't help yourself, could you, Sammy? Even when your mates got in the way. Leo Bassett, It was one of your patrols that John Dolan was covering. What's your personal reaction to his death? Look, I don't wanna... I have no comment. Hang on. There's Darcy. Well, looking at the brighter side, I did manage to sell that randy manager $10,000 worth of security alarm. Mr. Darcy, Stuart Littlemore, National News. Two killings, involving your organization, in the last few days. Isn't it all these uniforms and weapons, breeding violence? No, the violence is already there. We're hoping to combat it. We're just a symptom of the disease. Not the cause. Excuse me. (WHIRRING) (DOG BARKING) Hey. -Eric Jackson? -That's right. Detective Sergeant Sammy Rose, Hold-up Squad. -Who's this? -My brother, Brian. -You're Darcy's too? -Yeah, that's right. With the armored vans. -That's you. -Yeah. 'Course, I remember, Eric Jackson, who would've thought of it. -You were doing all right. Why'd you get out? -Got married. Wife wasn't too keen on someone bringing him home in a bucket. SAMMY: Yeah? You wanna go back to it? Drop out of that game for a few years and you're 1000 years old. -What's this? -It's gonna be a camper van. Cost much, this sort of thing? You reckon I knocked off that cosmetic factory to pay for it? Maybe he can pay some of the build it, then. Stop getting me over. SAMMY: Not really. Where were you last Tuesday night, Eric? I went up to the mountains. Had a few days off. Senior supervisor, you were in a position to tell from the patrol reports, -about that manager staying late. -Wasn't much of a secret. Patrol blokes used to watch them through the office door till they had the glass frosted. That manager went through secretaries like turds out of a canary's ass. (CHUCKLES) -Wife go with you to the mountains, Eric? -Yes. You can talk to her. She's in the house. What's your theory on all this? You've been at Darcy's a long time, must know everyone. Just about. I don't know. There's that bloke, Bassett, meant to be patrolling the place when Dolan got killed. Seen the place he lives in? His car? (CHUCKLES) -On a patrolman's wages. -Darcy's own enquiry cleared him. -Seemed pretty ordinary... -Well, it's an act. He's too ordinary. Tries too hard. (LOUD MUSIC PLAYING) Mr. Henderson? (SHOUTING) Mr. Henderson? Mr. Henderson? Ah. Hello, Sammy. Sit down. You met my mother. Mum, Detective Sergeant Rose. -(MUSIC STOPS) -Good afternoon, missus. Solved a lot of baffling cases lately, Sammy? Working on one at Darcy's. Might be worth keeping an eye on a Mr. Leo Bassett. Kathmandu Towers. Bassett? What's wrong? Police given up watching people? (CHUCKLES) Department works on a shoestring, costs a lot to watch a guy full-time. All right, Sammy. What'll you do for us? Darcy's is now a client of mine. You help me nail whoever is planning to take the counting house, I'll close the file on the armored van hold-up. I've never liked guns. I wouldn't come here if it wasn't compulsory. Well, why join a security company then? Well, I like driving. I'm gonna get transferred to the armored vans. -Here, let me show you. -You want? (GUNSHOTS) MAN: Righto, that's it for you blokes, Union meeting now. If anyone's coming at you, empty your gun in them. You can't rely on one or two stopping them these days. -Why is that? -Well, most of the crims are on drugs, stimulates them. They'll just get up again, if you don't hit them right in the heart. Don't worry about it, son. -You, uh, staying for the meeting? -Yeah. -Dick Martin. -Leo Bassett. -Yeah, I know, the night, um... -Dolan got killed. Yeah. Bad news. Remember, anyone asks a curly one, check if they're financial. If they're not, question's out of order. -Righto. Let's get on with it. Come on. -Give us a song then. Come on. Come on. This is serious. Come up here, Danny. Give us your wrist, son. Now you know the management reckons that chaining us to the catch is going to be an effective deterrent against hold-ups. (ALL MUTTERING) Crap! MAN 1: Right. MAN 2: Rubbish. I believe it'll be like tying a calf up alongside a river full of crocodiles. We'll have a frigging ball and chain around our feet next. Yeah. Correct. It's a matter of principle. A chain, is an infringement of personal liberty. MAN 3: We're not bloody convicts. -You ought to be, mate. -(ALL LAUGHING) MAN 3: Ahh, get stuffed! I tell you then, that we're unanimous, in telling the management they can shove their chains. (ALL AGREEING) MARTIN: No! -Martin. Richard Martin. -He's okay. Financial. Yeah, fine. (CHUCKLES) So, we have one dissenting voice. -(ALL CHUCKLING) -That's right. Listen, if we're chained to the money, it'll make it impossible for anyone to steal it. They wouldn't even try. And if Darcy's is robbed again, they'll never get insurance. And all of us poor bastards will be out of work. (ALL MUTTERING) Perhaps, you didn't know, Mr. Martin, that this idea was tried in Italy. They manacled two guards to a cash box. Mowed them down with a machine gun, sawed their bloody arms off and took the cashbox, with their arms still dangling by the wrists. Bullshit! They're chained up, Mr. Martin. -You'll be like a lamb being led to the slaughter. -(ALL AGREEING) A big leg of lamb. (ALL LAUGHING) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) Come on, son. Righto, righto. Calm down. Calm down. Meetings over. Mark down unanimous decision, no handcuffs. -Is it true what happened in Italy. -Oh, fucked if I know. -Feeling better? -Yeah. Tell me something that's been worrying me. If someone put a gun on your back, what would you do? I get my hands up real fast. You just wouldn't swing around with a stiff arm and knock it aside? Not me, Leo. (CHUCKLES) That's real hairy stuff. -Who told you that? -Eric Jackson. -Oh, that senior supervisor bloke. -Yup. -What else did he tell you? -Oh, nothing in particular. -He just seemed to want to provoke me. -Yeah? (KEYS JINGLING) (KEYS JINGLING) (KEYS JINGLING) Get your hands up, mister. (GRUNTS) Come on. -All right. Where's the body? -What body? The Darcy supervisor you clobbered. Bloke called Eric Jackson. What you do to him? Do to him? Don't put that act on with me. I am him. Come on. Come on. Look at all this, eh? You're just a bloody burglar. What Darcy's man would have all that stuff? Look at the photograph, you half-wit. Well. There is a passing resemblance. But then again, I'm always being told that I'm a dead ringer for Clint Eastwood. Patrol area C4 to C3. Come in. -C4 to C3. Come in. -C3. Oh, Leo, would you recognize a senior supervisor named Eric Jackson. Yes. Why? MARTIN: Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Face the bloody wire. I'm under orders from Darcy Security to run a field check on you, -Mr. Tricky Dickey Martin. -A field check? As I remember, senior supervisors are meant to field check patrolmen by accompanying them from their depot, right? This is the joker that claims to be Eric Jackson. But he's got a whole mess of bloody burglar tools with him. He even forced the gate. Take a look at this. More like an ass, than a face, isn't it? Dick, it is senior supervisor, Eric Jackson. -No. Really? -Now take off these handcuffs. In future, don't go sneaking up on people, huh? You're liable to get hurt. Come on, Leo. (KNOCKING LOUDLY) -Eric! -Great job that was. -Who told Martin I was coming? -Just hold it. What do you mean? It was just to field test him, that's all, you were the best man for the job. Who asked? Darcy? Conway? -Conway? -That's it then. -He's an old mate of Martin's! -Now, hang on, Eric. Just tell me what happened. -(SIGHS) I followed him into a container yard. -How'd you get in? -Had a kit. Hmm. -Burglars' kit? -Oh, Christ, man. You know... -You asked me to check him out, David. What do you expect me to do? Walk in there strumming a guitar? -Did Martin see the stuff? -Yes, he was waiting for me. Seemed to know what I was going to do. Smashed me over the head with a pistol. Darcy will read about it in the report. There's nothing I can do. -Oh, that's real gratitude. -I'm sorry. I try to pin down the bloke that did over poor old Dolan, and I get lumbered. -Dolan? You think Martin was in on it? -Of course. Got kicked out of the police force, didn't he? Probably all of them in it. Martin, Conway and Bassett. Conway? That's impossible. He's a branch manager. You told me yourself you thought he was paying some sort of graft to that copper that was always hanging around. -It could be hush money. -(CLOCK CHIMES) Hmm. And Bassett. Now, there's a strange one. Yeah, he turned up at the container yard tonight. Did he? I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll keep an eye on Conway. You get into Bassett's place. Have a good look around, see what you can find. Plant a microphone. All right. What about Martin's report? I'll think of something. But I'll try and get Darcy to put you in an office job for a while. Office job? What about putting me in the counting house? Sure as hell you need a better roster clerk than old Jameson. All right. I'll see what I can do. -I'd better be going. -No. Just... Stay for a while, Eric. Have another drink. See you, David. (DOOR CLOSES) -(STARTS ENGINE) -(TIRES SQUEALING) -(PHONE RINGING) -Yeah? Fairy bloke went out and a boxer-looking type turned up. -Seen him before. -Ernest. I think he's going up to the fairy's place. Okay. Try and keep him talking if he comes out. Bassett's. (KNOCKING) Right, 4th floor, room 48. -Want me to come with you? -No. All right. No worries. (ELEVATOR STOPS) -MAN: Door's locked. -Ah, if anyone was here, they'd be gone by now. Bugger! (GROANS) (SCREAMS) -Divorce cases, eh? -That's right. Ah, I can always tell. Meet a lot of bad people in my job. BASSETT: I don't like it, you shouldn't have called me at the office. SEAGERS: Yeah, but if I hadn't called you... Oh. Must be some money in this private detective business. -Security. -Security, whatever you call it. -In a hurry to go to the loo, were you? -Eh? Shit. -What are you looking for? -Nothing. Looking awfully hard for nothing. You know, somebody gets killed at the factory, and then your flat gets all smashed up. And you say this security work is boring. Mostly it is, Mindel. Do you think I look like Faye Dunaway? Some of the girls at work think I do. So having your flat broken into is all just part of the job, eh? No, it depends. -What's it depend on? -What? -Having your flat broken into? -Well, it depends on what you're doing. Do you think I have a good figure, Leo? Sure. -Are you doing something awful? -No. Why did somebody break into your place? You've got a secret, haven't you? What is it? Look, I haven't got a secret. Well, maybe it's a secret of Darcy's. Well, what is it? Go on, I love secrets. Well, I now work for an insurance company. Oh, that's nothing. So does my brother. Do you know he sold more insurance last year than anybody else in the state? -Yeah but this is different. -SEAGERS: Why? BASSETT: Well, I get put into places like Darcy's to check on people. You played right into his hands, Eric. SEAGERS: You're an undercover man. BASSETT: Oh, come on Mindel. That's a bit off. SEAGERS: Oh, Leo. This is so exciting. It's just like James Bond. They've gone into the bedroom. Any mic in there, Eric? You should've put it in there. Not in the living room. You'll have to use your imagination, Ernest. And in future, ignore people like Mr. Bassett. Keep a low profile, and you can get away with murder. But what do you actually do. Are you looking for someone in particular in this Darcy place? Darcy's. (CLEARS THROAT) -No, this apartment, the car, and me, are all just bait. -Bait. Well, no one believes I'm for real. So, if someone's got something to hide, they just come sniffing around. (LAUGHS) You mean you investigate by doing absolutely nothing. Mindel, you are an inquisitive girl. -I am not, I'm just very, very friendly, that's all. -Inquisitive. -Mmm. -(GIGGLING) (DOG WHINING) -Morning, Mrs. Jackson. We're from Darcy's. -Eric's not here. -Someone phoned. He's away on special duty. -Yes. I know. He left some stuff here, asked us to drop over for it. Gave us this key, stuff's in there. Oh, that's the garage key. He doesn't allow anybody in there. Oh, he's a good security man, Mrs. Jackson, don't you worry about it. Very ingenious, Eric. That replica van is evidently a real work of art. Do you know what, Eric? We found almost $40,000 under the floorboards. That must have been to finance its completion. Right? No. I've got a little proposal, Eric. You cut me in for a modest percentage, and I'll let the whole plan go ahead and give you some back up. How about that, Eric? (GRUNTS AND COUGHS) Get up, you idiot. He hardly touched you. (SCREAMS) ERNEST: Kick him. (BOTH GRUNTING) ERNEST: Catch him, you poofters! THUG: Take his legs! Well, Eric, back to my proposal. The plan goes ahead with my help and I take a modest percentage. -What percentage? -Oh... Sixty-six and two-thirds. Not modest enough. I do the work. I plan the job. And yet, some would say, I have the upper hand. All right. You can keep 40%, Eric. I'm being very generous. * Bring in the nail clippers. (MUFFLED GRUNTS) (MUFFLED SCREAMS) I genuinely find these methods distasteful these days, Eric. I'm a businessman, a collector, not a hoodlum. -Isn't that right, Ernest? -That's right, Mr. Henderson. Now, we can move along your foot toe by toe, and I wouldn't like that, you wouldn't like it either, or we could do a deal. Now what do you say, Eric? All right. Cut it, partner. Not a partner, Eric, I don't enter into partnerships. An employee. Do something about that blood, Ernest, it'll run all over the carpet in a minute. SAINSBURY: I still don't trust him. -He's too smart. -He doesn't trust us either. But I think he realizes he needs us. Not as much as we need him. We should've stuck to what we know. We're no good at business. HENDERSON: Defeatist talk, Ernest. We were beaten when those import restrictions were lifted. -After this, we'll re-equip and be able to compete with... -(ERIC COUGHING) Hello, Eric. How did my little idea go over? Like a Chinese brick balloon. This is an aggressive young man, Eric. He speaks in a very cheeky way, it's oddly familiar. My brother, Brian. Ed. This is Jack Henderson. I'd rather you all call me Mr. Henderson. I think a little respect... Respect? You just tortured poor bloody Eric. I think it makes for greater efficiency, don't you? Eric's just told me all about your little plan, Brian. Brilliant! That's the only word for it. But... There are flaws. One. You're going to have to finish building that van somewhere safer. Leave that to me. Two. You'll need more help inside the counting house itself. With three of my men along, you can halve the time it takes to load and get out. All right. But no one except, Brian, Ed and myself need know the details of the operation. Agreed. You're in charge... ...until you arrive at a tire place I own 10 minutes from Darcy's, Ernest here takes over then. We'll have you out of the country on separate flights, faster than anyone could credit. -Out of the country? -Were you thinking of booking into the Hilton? Throwing a big party, inviting a few girls around. And what about the money? That will be converted by us into appropriate currencies, and forwarded to you. Oh, I see. We steal 20 million bucks, give it to you, put on a false mustache and piss off to, I don't know where. -Trust is the name of the game, Brian. -Trust? If one of your mob said good morning to me, I'd put on my pajamas and go to bed. That's how much I trust you. You steal 20 million dollars, son, and every police force in the world will be looking for you. With my organization, you'll be able to keep the money. -Half of it. -40 percent. All right, whatever. For a couple of airline tickets and a bit of false hair? It's not much, I reckon, for 12 million bucks. -It's what you do for your share -Tell him, Eric. Without my help you'll be caught within a week. (SIGHS) MAN: Mind the water. (RADIO PLAYING INDISTINCTLY) Eric! How's the gout, Eric? -Oh, it's clearing up, thanks. -CONWAY: Get all that muck off the bonnet. That should teach you to lay off the pops, mate. (CHUCKLES) -Well, uh, look after yourself, all right? -Yeah, see you. How'd you get onside with that Welsh poofter? Listen to his boring stories about his marriage breaking up. Poor bastard got blackmailed by some little queen. Got chucked out of the police force, that's why he came out here. We still go on Wednesday? Yeah. Wednesday. All right, Brian, it's all over, mate. We know all about you. (BOTH LAUGHING) -All right, what's the joke? -Lie detector, mate. Darcy's got some yank in town going through the whole staff. You're on Tuesday, same as me. Graham's already done it. GRAHAM: Yeah, got all sorts of funny questions. They ask you if you toss yourself off, and when you say "no", -the bloody needle goes right through the ceiling. -(BOTH LAUGHING) There's one they keep asking over and over though. "You killed Dolan?", "You know who killed Dolan?", that sort of thing. Yeah? HENDERSON: All okay. DINO: Sure. HENDERSON: Just keep an eye on them, in the counting house. You should reach the tire depot by 1:30 p.m. Okay. Here's Ernest. They must have complete confidence in us, my reputation is built on it. Good morning, this is Dino, one of my men, he'll be helping you in the counting house. Not very big is he, wouldn't look too convincing in a uniform. Darcy's don't hire too many dwarfs. I can vouch for Dino's expertise. A lot of my jobs would never have been concluded successfully without him. Everything needed for your exit for the country is here, care to check it? Passports, traveler's checks, visas. One for France, one for Brazil, and one for Korea. Can't imagine why anyone would want to go to Korea? All this will be useless if we don't stop that lie-detector bloke. Maybe Dino should pay him a visit. -Dino? -Not necessary. I thought he was auditioning for Snow White this afternoon. I have a friend who's a fearless crusader for the underdog. Detective Sergeant Sammy Rose, please. Is your middle name Woodrow? Yes. Do you live in Sydney? Yes. Do you know who killed John Dolan? -No. -Can you keep still please? Did you have something to eat today? -Yes. -Did you ever smoke? Yes. -Were you present when John Dolan was killed? -No. -Do you wear glasses? -No. -Did you kill John Dolan? -Mr. Harris? -Yes. -We're from the licensing branch. Are you aware, you need an investigator's license... Look, I was advised that one of those wasn't required. -I'm a qualified... -We've had complaints concerning your activities. G'day, Sid. How you going? Still carrying out the odd bit of dirty work for Sammy Rose? (MAN COUGHING) All we need is for one of these to fall off and we're really in the shit. Ed, you right? Now listen. The money is to be stacked here. Right near the loading bay. There'll be four clerks, maybe five. Ed will get them into the union meeting by 1300 hrs. -Yeah, then I'll find an excuse to leave at 1310. -Right. -Now when you return to the counting house... -ED: Mmm. -We don't allow anyone through the security lock. -Right. I'll take care of the Chief Clerk. Brian, your truck, our truck, will be the second last one in. It's due at 1305. It's got to be accurate within two minutes. BRIAN: What about the gate guard? Oh, don't worry, they only check roster numbers, not number plates. And I'll be making up the roster. You'll just be listed as Van 26. They'll be arriving all morning, no one is going to notice an addition, providing it's not on the end. Smart, real smart. Yeah, but you're still gonna need number plates. Got a cast from one of the other trucks. Any you reckon this thing will fool them in daylight? -Of course. -It'd better. Don't run into anything. It'll break up like a matchbox. And sit there, for Christ's sake, when the last van comes in. Just let them park behind you. Who's in the last van? Dick Martin and Leo Bassett. Hmm. (ED COUGHING) I can't believe you don't reckon Jack Henderson isn't going to double cross us. He might. I'll grab that little dwarf, Dino, when we get to the tire place and blow his head off if they start anything. Look, Brian, if you're thinking about meeting that sort of yours sometime after all this is over, forget it. Cops will be watching her until she's a granny. I might not be around for a while. But I want you to sit tight, all right? I'll be in touch. No teenagers hanging around you, are they, Ed? (CHUCKLES) No way. Had a little sheila up in Korea, though. Soft and warm she was, just like a mouse's ear. (COUGHING) Listen, what about Dawn? I mean, are you just going to go off and leave her like that? ERIC: Her? Sure. She'll be free to marry that mongrel dog of hers. G'day, fellas, you happy? -Yeah, all right? -Hi, Rob. MAN: Simmons. Jenkins and Walsh. Truck 25, due 12:55. Martin, Bassett. Cross the number, van keys, pistols. Van 27, 1310 hours. -That's 10 past one? -1310. All okay, Mr. Jackson? Yeah. How about you? Lot of runs, eh? Yeah. When this business started, poor old Mr. Darcy had two men on motorbikes. Used to be able to organize the drives themselves. -There's been a lot of changes. -I'll say. Used to have a Wednesday turnover of about, uh... Oh, 300,000 dollars. -Today in here I'd say that... -20 million. That's right. About 20 million. DISPATCHER: Security check. What's up? -Nothing. -(BELL RINGING) You know, it's funny how we both got that transfer from the night patrols. BASSETT: Well, I've had my application in for a long time. (GATE WHIRRING) (CHATTING INAUDIBLY) (HORN HONKING) (INTERCOM BUZZES) Speak to me. WOMAN: Mr. Rose is on his way in to see you, Mr. Conway. How're they treating you, Robbie. Chugging along on one cylinder. Not enough here to cover expenses. Look, you're standing on us pretty heavy, Sammy, but you're not coming up with very much. No? Here's a name for you. Leo Bassett. (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) (CHATTING INDISTINCTLY) -Sorry to keep you waiting. -Lionel. -Yeah? -Sammy reckons we ought to keep an eye on young Leo Bassett. Leo Bassett is an insurance investigator for Legal and United. -Oh, Mindel. -That bloke wouldn't know his ass from a hole in the ground. -I thought you said we had to keep an eye on him. -Robbie. Robbie, you remember Mindel Seagers? She used to be a secretary here a few years ago. Yeah, best typist we ever had. She's been doing some field work for me. She's the one who discovered all about Mr. Leo Bassett. -Oh, Jesus, Lionel, you could've told me. -I'll bet she did. -After all, I'm only bloody branch manager. -Forget about it, darling. Your trouble is, you don't trust anybody not even people who work for you. I work on the "need to know". Okay, don't forget, union meeting at 1300. Roger 20. -Okay. -We need some more space. Let's clean this shelf up, I'll give you a hand. -What about the lie-detector bloke? -Not my doing Lionel. Jesus, look, monitors are out. Bloody video gear is useless. I'll ring them and see if I can get someone over. I think I better alert Mr. Darcy. No, no. I'll put a rocket up these blokes. (PHONE RINGING) Eric Jackson here, Senior Supervisor at Darcy's. Look, sport, your expensive video gear is on the blink. Could you send someone over straight away? It's our big day. Okay, so far. They're coming. Did you find out how those girls were getting the lipsticks out of the factory? -Of course I did. -How? I'm not going to tell you. What's wrong with your video? Oh, I don't know, the bloody things are always going out. -Hang on. -(BUZZES) -Yes, Mr. Darcy. -The video is out. A technical fault or something, Mr. Darcy, they're coming over to fix it. Is it all right to take this back to the union meeting? -It's not all right... -Look it's not that important -until the rest of the money comes. -Let him go, Barry. There's only a couple of vans to come, you're all set up to count. -Okay. -Righto. DH2 - DH27... Van 27. Your ETA, over. Should be at the counting house, at about 1310. -Righto, mate. -(BUZZES) All right, come on, it's really important. There's no way the force would ever take you back? -Not a chance. -Why is that? Ah, it's a long story. -Yeah. -Oh, I'm not complaining, Leo. (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) ROSE: Yeah, well, the talented Mr. Bassett, hasn't come up with anything. SEAGERS: He's got suspicions about someone. He hasn't proven anything yet. Yeah? Who? -Eric Jackson. -(SCOFFS) -Jackson? -Jackson? I checked him out, he's caught more suspects than Bassett's had fuck... Breakfasts. Well, he's a bit too flamboyant for my taste. Never liked the man, but he does his job well. Knows as much about the business as I do. You've always said you were the one person who could rob the place. That's true. These are the lie-detector reports. He hasn't done the test. Well, when's he scheduled to do it? Yesterday afternoon. We know why that fell through. -Look, I told you, you need a license for that. -David. -Don't blame me. David! Have Mr. Griffiths come to my office straight away. -Where's Jackson now? -Oh, he's off sick. Something to do with his feet. David will know. (INTERCOM BUZZES) (MUTTERS) -Yeah. -Conway. Right. (BUZZES IN) Where's Ray and everybody else? At the union meeting. Oh, yeah. Of all bloody days, they have to have a union meeting. -Hi, Barry. -G'day, Rob. -Everything all right? -Yeah, she's right. Good. Well, I don't like it, some of them should be here. We've got 20 million dollars coming in here today. I think I'll talk to Darcy about it. -Well, something's worrying me too, Robbie. -What? Well, you know I don't like to... Well, you ought to be a bit flexible about regulations around here. But half the blokes are stacking their beer in the vault. -Beer? -You can't move half the time, the beer cans. (CONWAY GRUNTS) The issue today is lie-detectors. Another infringement of our personal liberty! -(ALL AGREEING) -Yeah! (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) Your ETA, over. ETA schedule, plus two. BRIAN: Roger. Who's voice was that? Brian Jackson's, I think. I didn't see him at assignments this morning. Oh, there were about 100 blokes there, he must've been there. Yeah. (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) -New bloke? -Yeah, that's right. You're all right, off you go. Okay, the hatch. You can go to the union meeting, Barry. Second to last one in, I'll be right. You're a bit short on staff here, I think, Mr. Jackson. -You see, security regulations demand... -Oh, come on. Three guys had just arrived there'll be another three in a few minutes. (COCKS GUN) All right, if you say so. No. I better stay till the last one. (GRUNTS) All right, come on, load up! Hurry up! Get all those cages! Come on! Move it! Here! Come on you mug, get over. Come on! Get all that stuff out of here! Come on, move! -Move it! -This one! Shit! Jesus Christ! Pick that stuff up! Come on! Move! Move! Come on, let's go! Get him in! For Christ's sake, Eric, forget Martin and Bassett. We can load up and be out of here in three minutes. Delay them. They got two million dollars in that van! Two million bucks, what's it matter? You've been around money too long. You're out of your head! Van 27 to base. Twenty-seven. MARTIN: We'll be arriving in the counting house in about a minute. Get on with it. -Get out of sight! -Clear out, you blokes. -The last van! -Take these! -Take this one, quick! -Come on, move! Get inside! Get inside! I'm just going to round up a couple of late arrivals. Hold the fort a tick, will you? -I'm not gonna knock off Darcy's. -(ALL LAUGHING) I wouldn't know how. But I'd like to know for sure that some other blokes aren't... -(MEN AGREEING) -MAN: Yeah, too right. -Okay? -Yeah, okay. -Put yourself in the situation will you, half the staff... -Come in. David, how well do you know Eric Jackson? Jackson? -I suppose... -Well, I mean, are you friends? -I supposed you could say... -What's your opinion of him, professionally? He's a first-class security man. He's been of invaluable assistance since I've been here. Well, there you are. What did I say? All right, when will he be back, he has to do these detector tests. Back? Mr. Darcy, he is back, he started yesterday. (BEEPING) -Oh, fuck! -Shit! (BUZZING) Don't let anyone in! Tell then we're unloading the money! Yes. Oh, Lionel Darcy here, let me in, will you? I'm sorry Mr. Darcy but regulations state that no one is allowed in when a van's being unloaded. Is that right? Sounds okay. Yeah, probably, he knows the rule book by heart. I don't know, look, I'll go up and the round into the loading dock. No, no, no. It'll take you more than four minutes, we'll hang on here. -Last run! -That's right. See you at the union meeting! That bugger should've gone by now. Might have engine trouble. -Yeah. -Not worth a bloody bumper. Okay, okay. That's it, that's it. G'day. All right, now come on you jokers. Damn union meeting's been going for quarter of an hour. Come on! Come on! You too! What about the union meeting? All right, all right, what about this? Listen, your bloody union is more important than this. -I'll park it for you. -ED: Get a move on. What'd you say? I said, I'll park it for you. Why aren't you at the union meeting? Seemed pretty keen at the last one. -BASSETT: You coming? -(ED COUGHING) I'll catch up with you. (DOOR BUZZING) ERIC: That's right. Come on, come on. We better get to this damn union meeting, you never know what sort of regulations -(GRUNTS) -Jesus, what the bloody... Hey! Hey! (GUN FIRES) Inside, quick. Come on, over here! Eric! Eric, there behind you! (SCREAMS) (GROANING) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) Come here, you... Finish the loading! The loading! Over there, man! -(SHOUTS) -(GRUNTS) Let's go! Come on, Brian! Get up! Hey! Get the exit gate! I don't know how to work the fucking thing! You take the wheel! Come on! Move! Move! Get that money out of here! Move that crate! I'll hold it, just... Come on, come on! Move! Come on, take the fucking crate! -(INTERCOM BUZZING) -(GROANING) Get Martin! -(GUN FIRES) -(SCREAMING) Get over there! Get Martin! Come on! Eric! Come on, fuck you! Kill him! (GASPS) Get the roller door! Get the bloody roller door! Ed! Ed! Jesus Christ. (INTERCOM BUZZING) (LOCK BUZZING) (SCREAMING) Brian? Brian! Ahh! Fuck! (GRUNTING) (GASPING) (CLICKS) -(GUNSHOTS) -(SHOUTS) Captain Rose at Darcy's counting house wants to know ETA... Dumb. Get over this and they'll stick a medal on you and put you back on award wages. Any idea who they were? Never seen any of them before, except for your blokes. Dickey Martin did such a good job none of them will be talking either. Okay, what's your story? Why was your gun unloaded? I've never liked guns, Mr. Rose. I always take the shells out and put them in my pocket. Christ! Suppose your lot put you in here when they heard about the anonymous note. That's close. -I sent the note. -What? You what? You knew about all this? It was just bait. My company always assumes that there's someone that'll try and knock over a place like this. The note was just sort of to flush them out. You might've at least had the courtesy to have told me. You were one of the chief suspects, Mr. Darcy. Come on, mate, sit down. (SIRENS WAILING) Thanks mate. My. Darcy! Looks like the time lock was set. If Mr. Conway is in there, he's in there for 18 hours. Serves him right, he might lose a bit of weight. (TELEPHONE RINGING) -Yes. -I thought we had a deal, Mr. Henderson. There's been a lot of trouble up here at Darcy's. What's that got to do with me, Sammy? Some of them were friends of yours. But no one is going to talk anymore. It seems some guy didn't trust you too far. Left a little note. -Named a name. -Where is it, Sammy? Oh, I've got it. For safekeeping. Listen Sammy, I don't always pick winners but I hate to back losers. -Now I have a horse that's going to win... -Ten. Ten. Twenty grand for you this afternoon. I know I'm sensitive, but I don't like people to gossip. Jack, no one will breathe a word.
