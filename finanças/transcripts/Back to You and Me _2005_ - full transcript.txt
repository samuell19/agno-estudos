His room's available. I'll be in the doctor's lounge. - Yes, doctor. - Brenda, may I have Mrs. Mcgruder's chart, please? - Sure. - Thank you. She doesn't have much time left. So it's important that we try and keep her as comfortable as possible. Okay? - Yes, doctor. We need more doctors like that one. - Satellite pharmacy pick up 2245. - Hi. - Oh... - How are you doing? - Hi, Dr. Syd. The beeping is getting a little annoying. I suppose I'd really get annoyed when it stops. - I'm so sorry I couldn't do more. - Oh, are you kidding? You've already done so much for me. All the other doctors said I could just have four months, and you found a way to find me four years. Because of you I was able to see my son graduate from college, and I'll never be able to thank you enough for that. - I'll check on you a little later. If you need anything, you let us know, okay? - Okay. - Hey. - Hey. - You feel like going out to dinner tonight? - I think I'm going to stay here a few extra hours. What's up? You covering for someone? - Mrs. Mcgruder's slipping away. It happens, Syd. You've been doing this long enough to know it's all a part of life. - I know. It's just so hard to let go. - Your problem is you care too much. The less involved you get the easier it is to let nature take its course. Let me take you out to dinner, get your mind off it. - I don't think so. - Well, if you head home early, call me, I'll come over. My first surgery's not until 10:00 tomorrow. - Not tonight. - Okay. - Thanks, though. - Thanks for coming over. I really didn't want to be alone tonight. - Hey, what are friends for? - I know it's just a matter of time, but I still hold out hope that... That she's going to get to go home again. - Well, you've done everything you and modern medicine could, Syd. You know what Gretchen told me? - Hmm? - She didn't think I was happy. - Smart woman. - Oh, come on. I'm happy. I'm successful. I have a good practice. I'm in a decent relationship. - Dr. Personality? If that's a decent relationship, I'd rather die alone maybe with a house full of cats, but definitely alone. Balloon stationery? You going to a party at Chuck E. Cheese? - No. That's an invitation to my high school reunion. - And you're going, right? - Ah, you know, I can't see any reason why I should go. - Well, you haven't been home since your dad's funeral. Aren't you at all curious to see how things may have changed? - No, because I know they haven't changed at all. I've spent my whole life trying to distance myself from that place. - You could see your mother. - I don't think that's going to make me any happier than being right here with Mr. Personality. - Fine. All I'm saying is that it might be fun to see who got fat or bald. You'd be returning as a successful doctor who still wears the same size clothes as you did in high school. - It would be strictly on your own terms. And if you didn't have a good time, you'll always have this life to run back to. - Bloomfield is a little town where you're born, raised, work, marry and die. - Sounds like a simple life. - Yeah, but it's too simple for this girl. I had more world to see. - Are you going or not? - Anesthesiologist on call 7302. Anesthesiologist on call 7302, ♪ Country fiddle music - Morning, Helen. - Ruben, really? Exactly how is smoking going to help bloomfield become the healthiest town in america? - I'm doing my part. It isn't lit. Yeah, I hear Syd's coming back for the reunion. - What? - Well, how about that? I know something that's going on in this town before you do. That's got to be a first for anybody. - Cute. So how'd you find out? - Well, she faxed her rsvp to Nelson yesterday. Nelson told dusty when he stopped by the tavern for a beer after work. And dusty went home, told Cheryl who told me this morning when she came in to confirm the meat order for the reunion buffet. - Okay. Sounds like you got your own little gossip chain going there. - No, see, it's not gossip because we're all on the committee. We leave gossip to the professionals like yourself. - You know, it's the 21st century, Ruben. Get with it! Yeah, and meat is back, baby! - Hey, Helen! Helen! Wait a minute, wait a minute! - What? What? What? - Why didn't you tell us that Syd was coming back for the reunion? - Oh, well... - I always felt that Syd was the one that got away. - Me, too. - Helen. Helen! Helen, tell her to call me when she gets here! Ooh. Phew! Well, look who's here! - Hey, guys, stopping by for a cup of coffee and a hot chocolate. - Jake, aren't you a little young for coffee? - Mine's the hot chocolate. - Oh, my bad. I taught her that. - You trying to hip her up a little bit? - As if I needed hipping up. How you doing? How's your tummy? - It's doing pretty good. I'm having a good day. - Ha, so am I. - Hi there. - Until now. - Hey, handsome. - Hey. - You know, Helen, I'm glad I ran into you. I wanted to ask you something. - Yes, it's true. Sydney is coming back for the reunion, but I didn't say anything because I only found out myself. - Actually, I was wondering what would be a good time for me to stop by and fix that swing. - Oh. - So Syd's coming back for the reunion? - Yeah, apparently so. - Well, I think it's going to be great to see her again, won't it, honey? - Yep. - If she's like you, I can't wait to meet her. Oh, well. Don't hold your breath. She's nothing like me. - You know what? I got a cup of coffee and a hot chocolate waiting inside for the two special guys in my life. - Cool! - Swing, backyard? - Any time. Stop by. I've been chasing after that guy since high school. - Then you were just taking a break from chasing Gus during your first two marriages? - Well, I had to have something to do while he was unavailable. And I am going to wear him down and get him to commit whether he likes it or not. - I just can't understand why her first two marriages didn't work. ♪ Country music - ♪ when I think about the times ♪ ♪ that I sat crying in my beer ♪ jukebox pounding misery from ear to ear ♪ ♪ I know I tell myself i'm better off without you here ♪ ♪ but I'm looking for beginnings ♪ ♪ when the end is always near ♪ she's leaving in the morning ♪ sing a sad song for me ♪ keeping me in the dark don't know how long it will be ♪ ♪ but I've heard that tune before ♪ ♪ she said she's got to be free ♪ ♪ but I know that's not true ♪ and that's what's bothering me ♪ ♪ Anywhere you look ♪ it's everywhere and all around ♪ ♪ it's the blues they keep singing, lord ♪ ♪ it's bound to get you down ♪ but the melody can move you ♪ in a way to ease the pain ♪ and it won't be long before you're on your feet again ♪ ♪ song continues - Sydney ludwick! - Nelson, hey! Oh, whoo! - Hey, hey! I knew it was you. You don't have too many cars that look like that in this town. - You look great. - Thanks. You look pretty great yourself. - Oh, I do. I dropped 12 pounds. You know, we're all trying to get healthy around here. - Yeah, so I noticed. What's going on with that? - Well, this magazine's sponsoring this contest. So, we decided to be the healthiest town in america. Eating right, no smoking and a ton of exercise. - Now, this can't be good for Dr. Sheldon's practice. - Doc Sheldon, he died a couple of months ago. - Oh. - The town ain't been healthier. Hey, while you're here, maybe you could give us some pointers on how to get in shape. We're woefully lacking medical expertise. - I'll be happy to do what I can while I'm in town. - That's great. Say, maybe we can talk about it at, well... At dinner tonight? - Oh, I don't know. - Oh, come on. We'll go to Barney's. We'll have a lot of fun. That place is still there? - Yes! - Sure, why not. - Great! Um, I'll pick you up. - Okay... oh, no wait. I don't know where I'm staying yet. - Really? - Yeah. Why don't I just meet you there? Okay. Say, 8:00? We'll beat the early bird rush. - Wouldn't want to miss that stampede. 8:00! Okay. - Syd? - Ruben? - One in the same. -Hey, Ruben! - Hey. Still following in your father's footsteps, huh? - Yeah, well, bloody though they may be. Boy, it is good to see you, Syd. - Oh, thanks, you too. - You... you haven't changed at all. - Oh. - No, you look great. - Thank you. So do you. - Yeah, right. Got to be a few hold-outs from the health craze everybody's on in this town. And I am proudly leading the pack. We're a small but mighty group. - Well, you were never one to follow the crowd. - Well, your mom was surprised when I told her you were coming back. - She knows, huh? - I hope I didn't spoil the surprise. Well, I've got to get back to my shop. You know what they say... meat waits for no man. Okay. - Well, I say it anyway. See you around. - Okay, bye. - Well, look-ee here. If it isn't Syd ludwick. - Connie jergens. - Yep. But I haven't been jergens since high school. It's Murray now. It was Connie Bradford for a while there, but that didn't quite work out. Then I became Connie Murray. Kept the name, just not the husband. But you're still ludwick, right? - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I guess I just haven't been as lucky as you. So, what can I get you? - How about a latte? - Okay. Non-fat? - Nah, bring on the real stuff. - Whoa. I haven't sold too much of the real stuff lately. Seems like this whole town's gone health crazy. - Yeah, so I hear. - Would you like something to go along with this? To eat, maybe a muffin? I got non-fat blueberry, non-fat banana and my special non-fat zucchini. No, I'm fine. Thanks. - I also got some caramel sticky buns, but they're a day old. Can't seem to move the stuff that's really bad for you. - I'm good. - Okay. - Thank you. What do I owe you? - Forget it. Consider it my little welcome home gift. - You got a nice little place here. - Yeah. I was able to swing it with my divorce settlement, the second one. - But between you and me, I don't how much longer I am going to keep it. Connie Martin. As in Gus. Well, you remember Gus, don't you? - I believe I do. - I thought you would. You two were quite the item in high school, as I remember. All through college too, right? - Yes. Mm-hmm. - Gee, must have been really hard when he ran off like that and got married. - We hadn't been together for quite some time. - Yeah. I've been taking really good care of them. I know that boy of his can sure use a mom. - Gus has a son? - Yeah... Jake. He's a sweet kid. But he's not well. - What's wrong with him? - Not sure. He's been to a lot of doctors. Nobody can seem to figure it out. Hey! Maybe you can figure it out while you're here. - I'm sure his doctors are doing all they can. - Yeah. I suppose. - You know what, I think I will have one of those sticky buns. - Right. - Yeah, the big one. - To go? - To go. - On the house. - Thank you. See you around. - I'm sure I will. It's got to be a warning. Okay, I can do this. Quick hello, and I'm gone. Hi. - Hi. Come on in. Oh, it is good to see you. Oh, come. Come. Oh... Well, let me... let me look at you. Oh, you haven't changed a bit. - Oh... - Hey, why don't we sit down? - Okay. Wow, new furniture. - Yeah. Well, the... the old stuff was getting to look old. So, I decided to change things. - Looks nice. - I wish you'd let me know you were coming. The only news I like to get from my butcher is that tri-tip is on sale. - I probably should have let you know, but i... I just wanted to get settled in first. - How exactly did you expect to get settled in without my knowing it? - I thought I'd just get a room at the inn. - Ah! To quote the Bible, there is no room at the inn. In fact, there is no inn. - Really? - Nope. You really should have phoned ahead. You know, that placed closed years ago. - Where do people stay? - There is a very charming little bed and breakfast spot that's opened up since you've been away. - Oh, maybe I'll try there. - Hi, folks. You settled in okay? - We sure did. - Well, everything all right? - Oh, just wonderful, as usual. - Come on in here, and there's someone I want you to meet. This is my daughter, Sydney. - This is Sydney. Well, it is a pleasure to meet you. We have heard so much about you. - You have? - Sure. Every time we stay here, your mom talks about her daughter, the doctor. - It's nice to finally put a face to the name. - Well, it's nice meeting you, too. - Wine and cheese at five? - As always. See you later. - Okay. Nice meeting you. Bye-bye. - Yeah. Yeah. - You've turned this place into a b&b? - Didn't you see the sign outside? - Well, the sign says ludwick's. It doesn't say anything about a b&b. - Oh, well, it's subtle. - Subtlety has never been one of your strong suits. I know. Ah, it's such a big house, and it was just sitting empty. And so i... I thought I'd put it to use. Besides, it's nice having people around to talk to. - It's a shame you didn't think of that when you had someone around to talk to. - Excuse me? - Daddy was very ill sitting around this house, this big house all by himself. - That's not how it was. - It's not? - You really have no idea of what went on here before your dad passed away. - Passed away? Is that what you call it? - I prefer to put it that way. And now you're lonely, or you're guilty or whatever you are, and you decided to open our home to... to anyone who can pay the nightly rate? - "Our home"? This place stopped being your home after your dad died. My gosh, you even stayed at the inn when you came back for his funeral. - You know, I wish I still had the option. I... i... i... I guess you'll just never understand. - I guess I won't. This was a bad idea. Bad idea! I'm going to find someplace else to stay. - Sydney, please, please don't go. Besides, there's no place else in town to stay. Now, please...For me. Your old room is still available. - Okay, but... I'm a guest in this house. So I want to pay for the room. - Oh, no, don't be... - I insist. Okay. I guess you remember where your old room is. - Yes. - And there's wine and cheese at five. - So I've heard. - So, do you want some help with your... - no, thank you. I'm fine. - Hey, stranger! - Hi! - Hi. I heard you were coming back for the reunion. - Well, it seems to be the talk of the town. - Well, it's big news. The prodigal doctor returns. - If you're the welcoming committee, it's a pretty weak turnout. - Well, thanks. - No, I just came to fix your mom's swing. - Oh. You've got your own construction company, and it looks like a helper, huh? - That's my son. Hey, Jake! Why don't you come on over and meet the lady. Syd ludwick, this is my son Jake. - Hi, it's nice to meet you. - Pleasure to meet you. Syd? Isn't that a boy's name? - It's short for Sydney. My dad always wanted to go to Australia. - Huh? I'll explain it to you later. Why don't you go get the small tool bag? - Okay. Nice meeting you, Syd. - Okay. - Nice meeting you too, Jake. Oh, he's so sweet. - I know. I like him. He acts a little old for his age sometimes, but he's real insightful. - Yeah. They grow up fast these days. - Yes they do. So, how's life in the big city? - Good. Busy. - Huh, sounds like to me a little dose of small-town life might do you some good. - We'll see. - So I understand you've only been in town for a couple of hours, and you've already got a date for tonight? - I do? - Nelson. - Nelson. You know, I told him I would have dinner. But it's not really a date. - Somebody better explain that to him. - Well, you know I found out that you and Connie are really hot and heavy. - What? - Yeah, I saw her today, and she couldn't stop talking about it. We... You know, go out every once in a while. But we are not hot and heavy. - Well, somebody better explain that to her. I guess I better go get settled in. - Yeah, yeah. We better tackle that swing. Syd... It's good to see you. - You, too. - I think she likes you, dad. - You think so? - Definitely. I can tell these things. - I tell you what, how about we head out back, and we tackle that swing, and you can tell me all about how you know these things. Okay? - Okay then. - I just can't believe it. She saved all my things from high school. - That's what mothers do. - Not my mother. - Maybe it just seemed like that. - This isn't going to turn into a long-distance therapy session, is it? - So, does being back home bring you back a lot of memories? - Yeah! Of what a geek I was. Apparently, I won the science fair four years in a row. - And retired undefeated. But you couldn't have been that much of a geek. You did get the captain of the football team. - Who I ran into today. - Oh, yeah? And how does he look? - Pretty good, actually. - Who'd he end up with? - He's been involved with somebody in town since his wife died. - So he's single? - No, he's involved with someone, which that someone was sure to point out to me today when I saw her. - Excellent. She senses a little competition. - I'll call you soon, okay? - You're the doctor. Catch you later. Bye. - Bye. - So, Matilda, I'm going to have the surf and turf, charred on the outside, medium rare on the inside. The steak, not the lobster. And the salad bar. That's included, right? - Mm-hmm. - Is a baked potato bad for you? - Oh, no, just what you put on it. - Ah, phooey! I'll tell you what... give me a side order of sliced lemons. Thank you very much, Matilda. - Sure. - You know, I read in this health magazine that if you squeeze lemon juice all over a baked potato, it tastes just like butter. - Does it? No. - Hey, Marie. How you doing? - Um, how about that nice, quiet table in the corner? That okay with you, honey? - Sure. Right this way. - Who would ever think that those two would be dating? - Connie. - Enjoy your meal. - Hey, you want to get a salad? - Yeah, sure. - ♪ All I need is everything I want ♪ ♪ that makes you everything I need ♪ ♪ fiddle solo ♪ everything I need is on my one-track mind ♪ - So then, after law school, I decided to move back to bloomfield. There wasn't a lawyer in the town. So it seemed like a natural thing to do. And, you know, it's not the most exciting practice in the world, but it serves a purpose. And I really think that i'm serving a purpose for this town. - Would you excuse me a minute? - Sure. - Mm. Come here. Come on. Open up. - No, no. - Hey, good-lookin'. You come here often? - Not too often. - Pity. You definitely class the place up. - How about you? You spend a lot of time hitting on women in bars? - Only the strange ones. As this is the only real restaurant in town, you never know who you're going to run into. Ed Jenkins, how are you? Oh, I'm good, Syd. It's been a long time. - Yeah. - Your father's funeral, i... - right. I never really got to properly thank you. It was a nice service. - My pleasure. - But I guess I was caught a little off-guard. I mean, the wildest guy in my high school was now a minister! Weren't you voted class clown? - I... Syd, meet the class clown's wife, Pam. I present Pam. - Hi, Pam. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. - Why don't you just sit down for just a second, Syd? - Okay. I'm sure you know your husband was a bit of a wild man. - Oh, I've heard all the stories, and I've read most of the police reports. - Did you see Gus walk in? - Yeah. - He looks as good as he did in high school, doesn't he? - I hadn't noticed. - You know, we have nothing going tomorrow afternoon. Would you like to come over for an early supper? Ed will barbecue. - What a great idea, unless, of course, you and Nelson have plans. - You are still a troublemaker. I'm going to help the reunion committee in the morning for a little while, and then I'm free. What time is good? - Why don't I pick you up around 3:00? - I've got my own car. - But I could be your designated driver. Things tend to get a little wild around my house. - Oh, I could imagine. It was nice meeting you, and I'll see you tomorrow. - Mm-hmm. That was great. Good call. - Looks great, Bob! Keep it level! - All righty. - Careful with the balloons. They're expensive. Oh my gosh. My favorite colors. - This looks marvelous. - Oh, good. What about the chairs? - Uh, the chairs. We'll do those last. You guys need me for anything? I'm going to go set the bar up. - No. - No, I think we're good. - You're doing a great job. Thanks for helping. Oh... We're all so excited that you decided to come back to the reunion. - Oh, thanks. - To be honest, we're a little surprised. In a good way. - No one's more surprised than me. - I bet this place brings back memories for you. - No, not really. - Now, come on. Don't you remember standing up on that stage in the school assembly and giving that winning speech? - I... you know, I'd forgotten all about that. - Are you kidding me? "Respect for law... cornerstone of citizenship." - The newspaper even printed it. That was a good year for us. You won the state speech competition, and the football team won the state championship. - You know, i... I just must have been off in my own little world. - Newspaper did that story with your mother about how proud she was. You know, I always find it a bit odd that they interviewed her and not you. - That's my mother, a little bit odd. - She is whipping this town into shape. She's even helping us pick out a healthy menu for the dinner reunion. I've got the centerpieces! - All right! Go, bulldogs! - They look great. - I know. The rest are in my car, please. - I will get them. I need a hand. - Connie, you really did a great job. - Thanks, but I can't take all the credit. Gus did help me some. - Okay, we'll... we'll take these. - Thank you! - I hate to admit it, but she really did a good job. - Yeah, she did. - Seems Connie's trying to Mark her territory with you. - Apparently. - Well, she still hasn't forgotten senior prom when you and Gus disappeared. - You know, he got a new truck, and we just went for a ride. - Right! - That's ancient history. We had our chance. It didn't work out. - But if you're curious, he happens to have a new truck. - Hey, honey! - Is that what I think it is? - You got it. - Could be. - Oh, boy. - Open, open. - Party time! - Whoo! - Let's get this puppy up. - It's perfect! Oh, Gus, honey. It's going to be so romantic. Too bad you have to be alone tomorrow night, Syd. You're going to miss out on all the romance. - Connie. - What? I was just feeling sorry for her. - She's not going to be alone. She's going to be with me. Aren't you, Syd? - That's right. - How sweet. - I'll take this. We've got $500 invested in it. - It's so hard to picture you as a father. - Oh, believe me, it surprises me sometimes. - We're sure glad you could come over. - Oh, thanks. Well, luckily my social calendar was wide open. - You've been pretty popular since you got back to town. - Yeah, much more so than when I actually lived here. - That's not what I hear. Ed says you were very popular. - Well, your husband stretches the truth a little. - Have you had any time to spend with your mom? - No, not really. - Hey, guys. - Hey - sorry I'm late. I've just been... - Hi. - Hello. - Hey, where's Jake? - Oh, uh, I dropped him off at a friend's. Promised to teach him how to play a video game. I'm going to pick him up later. - I hope you two don't mind. We've been trying to get Gus over here for quite a while now, and Syd's only in town for a few days. So... I hope it's okay. - It's fine. - I don't know. It's... No, it's... it's good. It's good. I could use something cold to drink though. - Oh, I got to tell you, Pam, these two were inseparable during high school. Mm-hmm. - Then when Syd went off to college, every vacation or summer she would come home, Gus would drop everything and spend every minute with her. Is that true? - Well, I'm afraid it is. - Yeah. - After medical school, the whole town thought Syd would end up back here with Gus, open her practice right here in bloomfield. After your father passed away, I thought you might come back to be near your mother. - You have no idea how hard it was losing him and seeing how she treated him. She was the life of the party when he needed her most. - It wasn't like that, Syd. - No? No. I was your dad's pastor near the end, and we talked a lot during that most difficult time. I think your perception of what was going on is different than the reality of the situation. - She abandoned my father. That's the reality. - You might think you know what was going on, but I'm sure you don't. - Why don't you tell me then. - I wish I could. But I can't betray the trust they put in me as their pastor. The only person who can tell you what you really need to know is your mom. - And to find that out I would have to have a meaningful conversation with her. And that's not going to happen. - Ed, you should put the steaks on. - That's a good idea. Come on, Gus, give me a hand. - All right. Ladies. So how do you like your steak? - I shouldn't... - You voiced your feelings in front of friends. Sometimes we need to do that. - Thanks. - You sure you don't mind letting Gus take you home? - Isn't that the way you had it planned? I wouldn't want to disappoint you. Huh. - Thanks for coming, Syd. We had a great time. - Oh, great, after I went off on my mother... - Part of my pastoral duties is to listen. - You know, you havechanged. - We all change, one way or another. - Not all. - You know, Syd, I've learned an awful lot since high school, but I think the most important thing that I've learned is that... To be truly happy, you need two things... love and forgiveness. And you can't have one without the other. - Tell Pam I said thanks again, okay? - I will. - Okay. - Well, Eddie sure barbecues a good steak, doesn't he? - Yeah, he does. But you know what? - Mm. The last time I rode in a truck was with you. Oh! - We used to spend an awful lot of time in my old one, didn't we? - Yes, we did. Yes, we did. And we always seemed to end up at the same spot. - Yes, we did. - Do you remember? - Yes, I do. - Well, I'm thinking it would be a shame to take you straight home, if it's been that long since you've enjoyed the exquisite ride - of an American-made... - Truck. - It would be a shame. - Yeah? Yeah. - You want to get in? Yes. - Hey, cupid, you have dishes to do. - Oh, so many memories at this lake. My dad taught me to swim right there. I fell in love the first time. - With who? With you. - Oh! It's just as beautiful as I remember. - I still come up here every once in a while when I need to get away. - I bet Connie likes it. - I wouldn't know. - Really? - I've never brought her up here. Other than you, the only woman I ever brought here was Julie. - You must miss her terribly. - Every day. - It must have been so hard for Jake. - It was. And no matter how many different times I tried to explain it to him, all he knows is that his mom is gone forever. To top it all off, he's still sick all the time. - What's wrong with him? - Nobody can figure it out. I mean, the doctors over at mount bedford say he's just a kid who's susceptible to getting sick all the time, but I think there's more. But they're the doctors. - Do you want me to take a look at him? - I'd love for you to do that. Well, I guess, uh... Things worked out for both of us. I mean, you got to be a big, successful doctor, and I got to be the father of the greatest kid on earth. - If he's anything like his dad, he's a pretty great kid. He is. - Oh. - So, what do you think? Do you want to come and hang out with us tomorrow? - Don't you have to work? - Only when I want to. - Yeah. I would love to hang out with you guys. Well, you were gone a long time. I guess. - Where were you? Mother, I stopped having to answer to you a long time ago. - I wasn't asking to check up on you, I was asking to see if you had a good time. - I did. I went to Ed's, and then Gus and I went for a drive. - Oh. - Now I'm going to bed. - Sydney... We have to talk. - There's really nothing to say. - Yes, there is. There is a lot to say. - Like what? - To begin with... I'm sorry. I'm...i'm... I'm just so sorry, for whatever I did that's made you hate me. I admit, I made a lot of mistakes. All parents do. But... Was I really that bad a mother, to make you want to leave, to run away from me? - You ran away from me. - Oh, Sydney, that's so not true. Honey, I was always proud of you. - When I won the speech contest, why did they interview you at the newspaper instead of me? - You wouldn't talk to them, remember? You were very shy, honey. You always felt uncomfortable when anybody made a fuss over you. A lot like your father in that respect. Certainly a lot more like him than like me. - He always took a backseat to you. - Yes, because that's just... that's who he was. He was a wonderful man. He was the most incredible man I've ever met. Everybody loved your father. But... he was very shy, just like you. - I thought you would have changed when daddy got sick, but you didn't. You just kept socializing and leaving him at home. You left him... all by himself to just waste away. - Is that what you think? - Yes. - Oh, Sydney. Sydney... I loved your father... More than I've ever loved anyone in my entire life, except you. When he first got sick, i...i wouldn't even go out of the house, except to go get groceries or something we needed. I...i never left his side. And, you know what? He hated it. But towards the end, every time I called, you were gone. And...and he would put on his happy voice, But I knew he was hurting. - Yeah, that was him. Sick as he was, he was always more concerned about me than about himself. Always insisted that my life not change just because he was so sick. I guess maybe to some people, it... it looked like I was always out in town and leaving him alone here in the house by himself. But I only did that because... He asked me to. When I'd come home, you know, we'd sit around and talk, and i'd...I'd tell him everything that was going on in town, and... make him laugh. Make him happy. He put up with a great deal of pain, probably more than you or I could endure... Until he was absolutely certain that we would be all right without him. He knew I was doing research into his condition. He knew that. If he could have just held on, maybe I could have done something. - Sydney, listen. There was nothing anyone could do. - But he didn't even give me a chance. - Honey, just let it go. - Oh! Why did he leave us? - That's... That's one I can't answer. Ah, you feel so good! Oh, I'm just sorry... I'm so sorry we didn't have this talk sooner. Good night. I'll leave you. - Hey, Jake! Don't forget your soccer ball! And hurry it up, ok? I don't want to keep the lady waiting. What lady? Hi. - Hi. What's up? - Well, I bought my new dress, which you're gonna love. - A new dress? - For the reunion. - Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, sure. - So, um... Keep what lady waiting? - Syd, uh, is going to go to the park with Jake and I. We're going to, you know, catch up on our lives. - Oh. How sweet. - Hi, Connie. You want to go to the park with us? - You know, I'd love to, big guy, but I've got to do my nails. You guys have fun, huh? - Ok. - Bye. Mm. See you later. - Okay. Hop in. So, what do you think, huh? - Yeah, the park looks great. Nothing's changed. Oh, come on. We've got new playground equipment. - That stuff's been around as long as I can remember. That long, huh? - Yeah. Hey, dad, can I go play? - Sure. Just be careful. - You know, if you want to come play with me, it's okay. - Okay. I'll be over in just a minute. - Okay. - Oh, he's so cute. - He's just like his mother. You would have liked her. - I'm sure I would have. - We used to come here all the time. - Well, I'm glad we're here today. - I am too. Have a seat. Let's see what we've got here today. We got your peanut butter and jelly, your roast beef and Swiss, and your tuna on organic whole wheat, with sprouts and cucumbers. - I'll have roast beef. - Are you sure? - Yeah, why? - I thought you'd take the healthy one, the tuna, being a doctor and all. - I'll take the tuna. Are you sure? - Yes. - Don't let the fact that Jake and I despise tuna influence your opinion here. Give me the tuna. Are you sure? - Yes. - Okay. - How long has he had that tic he does th his head? - Ever since he was little. Doctor said it was just a habit that he'd grow out of. - Hi, Nelson. Earth to Nelson. - Oh, Connie, I'm sorry. Hi. - Hi. - Can I have a lemonade and a low-Cal sweet roll? - Sure. Thanks. - So, you ready for the big night tonight, the big date with Syd and all? - We're just going to the reunion together. It's not a date. - Hey, it's your chance to work your charms on her. Yeah, right. If I tell you something, you promise you won't laugh at me? - No. Ah! I'm kidding. Go ahead. Tell me whatever it is you want to say. - Well, despite all my efforts and charms, I firmly believe that Sydney is definitely not interested in me. Oh. I'm sorry, Nelson. - Why? I mean, that's my luck. It seems like I'm always chasing someone that's not interested in me. - Well, it's not always going to be that way. You are going to find someone who appreciates you for you. You're a great catch. - Well, the town's only so big, Connie. - I know. Except for you, I've married about every eligible man in it. - But you're going to be fine. You're smart, hard-working, and heaven knows, you're very, very pretty. - Well, thank you, Nelson. That's very sweet. - Hey, dad, can I jump off? - I don't think so, son. - But I'm having a good day. - I know you are, but not today. - How about the slide? - Okay. Quick, stop me, Syd. Stop him, Syd. - Okay. Okay. Okay! Ah! Gotcha! - There you go. Easy up now, hear? All right, show us what you got. Go. - Whoo! - Good. - Come on, Syd! Get back up there. - I'm going. - Come on, let's go again. Ready? - Ok. - Come on, big girl! Okay. - That looks like it's going to hold pretty good, I think. - I think. - Yeah. Yeah. Hold on a sec... - This is for the party, am I right? - Yeah. Coming through, y'all. Here is a list of several volunteers who are going to be designated drivers. - Oh, that's good. That's very good. - Well, who knows, I might end up needing one myself. - Aren't you losing a little weight? - Well, yes, I am. Thanks for noticing. - Good going. Good going. Keep it up, girl. - It's nice of you to help set up, Helen. - Well, contrary to some people's opinion, I can be of help. - And how are you and Syd getting along? Why don't you just cut right to it, ed? - Directness is my best suit. - You know how they say sometimes when you haven't seen someone for a long time, you just pick right up where you left off? - Let's head home. - That was fun. My mom used to do those kinds of things with me. I like her, dad. She's a keeper. I can tell these things. - ♪ It's never felt so real ♪ nothing else really matters ♪ ooh, yeah, yeah - it was nice meeting you, Randy. - Nice to meet you. - Hey, uh, honey, did you want to go mingle? - I do.

I love to dance. - As I recall, Gus, you were never much of a dancer either. - No, not really. - You know what? I've got a great idea. Why don't we let these two dancing machines go for it, and you and I will sit this one out? - That sounds good. Would you just excuse us for a second? - thanks. W... Uh! - Thank you so much.

But that, uh, same someone is still in my way. So, honey, don't wait. Don't walk. Run. Get out of here.

Okay. - So what did you... - you look... Go ahead, you first. - You want to go back in? Yeah? Okay. - You think you should have done that? Hey, who's the football hero around here, huh? - I've got a lot of fond memories of this place. - You should... state championship, all-state starting quarterback. It was a pretty good year for you. - Hey, do you know what my favorite memory was? - What? You... Sitting right over there at every one of those games. I always knew where you were. You know why I used to sit over there, don't you? - No. That's the first place you ever kissed me. - I remember. I was always hoping that that kiss would go on forever. You wanted to stay in bloomfield. I had to get out of here. - Was it that simple? - You know it wasn't. - I know. - But, look, you... You've got a great son. - Yeah. And you seem happy. You seem cold. Why don't you put this on? So, what about you? Do you have, uh, anybody that makes you happy? My friend Brenda calls him my "settle for." - Settle for? I'll have to remember that. - So, it's not too serious, huh? - Hardly. I've only loved two women in my life... you... And I honestly never thought that I would find love again. And then something happened. - What? You came back into my life. - are you sure we should be doing this? - I've never been more sure about anything in my life. Sorry. That's my, uh... Phone. It's Jake's sitter. Hey, Lisa. Lisa. Slow down. All right. No, I'll be right there. We've got to go. It's Jake. Something's wrong with him. - I am so sorry. He threw up a couple of times, then he started to grab his stomach and cry and said that it hurt. I didn't know what else to do but call you. - It's all right, Lisa. You did the right thing. How you doing, pal? - Daddy, my tummy hurts. It hurts so bad. - Hey, can I take a look? - Hi, Jake. - Hi, can you make the hurt go away? - I'm sure gonna try. How long has he had these abdominal pains? - Ever since he was a baby. The doctor said he had a sensitive stomach. We try to watch what he eats, but these stomach aches just coming back. But never this bad. - Okay, Jake. Does this hurt? - Ow! Yes! - The closest hospital is mount bedford, right? - Right. - You know what? We're gonna make these tummy aches go away. - Okay. Come on, let's go. - Come here, buddy. Here we go. What's wrong? - I'll explain on the way. Let's go. - Go ahead. - He's asleep. How long has it been since he's seen a doctor about this? - About a year. They all said it's just something he's going to have to learn to live with. - I think he has a mass in his abdomen. There's...there's a disease that affects children usually a lot younger than Jake. But if it wasn't caught, he could have had it for some time. It's a form of cancer called neuroblastoma. - Cancer? - Its symptoms are abdominal pain, lethargy, weakness. Irregular eye movements are also one of its manifestations, along with a facial tic. And sometimes, loss of muscle control. - I can't believe not one of those doctors found it. - Well, if you're not looking for it specifically, it's easy to miss. - Is he going to be okay? - We need the attending out here, stat. I said stat. - Excuse me. What's going on here? - Are you the attending? Who are you? - Doctor Sydney ludwick, Fairview memorial. I've got a six-year-old with acute abdominal pain. The situation has been recurring since infancy. He's possibly developed a mass in his abdomen. There's pain in the upper left quadrant accompanied by acute myoclonic encephalopathy. Now, you need to do a cat scan and a blood count series, and if there's a surgeon on call, I suggest you notify him. - Let's get him in examining one. I need a cat scan, blood count workup, and electrolyte panel. - You might want to do a spot urine test for vma and hbc. That will tell us everything we need to know. - Right. All right, you heard the doctor. Let's go, hey, get the gurney over here. Come on, nurse. - Right away. - Get Dr. Schmidt in here stat. - Oh, you're going to be fine. - Dr. Schmidt to E.R., stat. Dr. Shmidt, E.R., stat. - Let's put him in one. Dr. Sharpe to E.R., Dr. Sharpe to E.R., please. Wheelchair to admitting. Wheelchair to admitting, pleas. Orthopedics, line three. Orthopedics, line three. Knock, knock. - Who's there? - How's our patient? - I think he's feeling better, but he hasn't gotten his sense of humor back yet. - Trust me, dad, if it was funny, I'd laugh. Sounds to me like his sense of humor is just fine. How you doin'? - Pretty good, I guess. - Pretty good? Well, you know what? It says right here that you're doing really good, except not getting enough ice cream. - Does it really say that? - It does now. Cool. Are you going back to the city? - Yes, I have to. - Are you ever going to come back to see me? - Of course! And we'll go to the park again. - You sure are the prettiest doctor I've ever seen. - Thank you. - She sure is. This is the Adams chart. Please file it for me. Hey, stranger, this is a surprise. How are you? - I'm okay. - How is, uh, small-town life agreeing with you? - I diagnosed a case of neuroblastoma last night in a very young boy. They operated and saved his life. - That's nice, Syd. When are you coming home? Soon, Tom. - Give me a heads-up. We'll have a romantic evening and celebrate your coming back. - I wish you'd stay a little longer. - Oh, I've got patients waiting for me. - Well, what about Jake? - He's in good hands. - I'm so proud of you. You know, I've always been so proud of you. - I almost missed it. All the signs were there when I first met Jake, and I almost didn't see it. - Yeah, but you did see it. You know, you saved that little boy's life. Hmm? After all, you can only help those that can be saved. - I know. Oh! I'm so sorry I wasted so much time between us. - Oh! That's okay, I still love ya. We have ourselves a brand-new beginning. - Yeah, we do. I love you too. - Oh. Oh! It would be so nice if this old town had someone like you taking care of us. - I'm going to stop by the hospital and see little Jake before I hit the road. - You haven't even had your coffee yet. - I'll drop by Connie's and get a latte, give her one last shot at me. Drive carefully. - Mother. What? Bye. Bye. Bye. Oh. Bye bye. - Hey, the gang's all here. - Large latte, whole milk, just the way you like it, on the house. - Thanks. - Helen called to say you were going to stop by, so I decided to give you curb service. Sort of a little truce offering? - Truce? - I, uh, think that's Connie's way of saying that she's been a little snippy with you. - That's a sweet way to put it. - Truce. My mother really called, huh? - Yeah, well, you know Helen. She's always on top of things. - Come here. You know, that little boy really likes you. - Thank you. - Hey, Nelson, would you like to learn how to make a smooth, sweet latte? - Sure. Come on. - Oh. - I'll see you, Syd. - Okay. - Thanks. - How's the town hero today? - Oh, hey. Hero? - Well, I just came from visiting Jake. He's looking pretty fine, thanks to you. - I'm a doctor, not a hero. - You're a hero to Gus, and this town. I stopped by Helen's. She said you were here. She was in a very good mood. Yeah. I'm glad you two talked. - Me too. - You and your mom are a lot alike. - You think so? - Yes, I do. You both care a great deal about other people. That's a very good trait. - I know you, uh... I...i know you were hoping that Gus and I would end up together. - I'm always here, if you ever need someone to talk to. - Oh, do you really think I'm going to open up to the guy who flew the principal's pants up the flagpole? I don't think so. - I'm still trying to figure out how you pulled that one off. - Let's just say you had to know the right time to break into his office. Troublemaker. Thank you for everything. - My pleasure. Hope to see you soon. - You know, Syd's the one that finally figured out what was making you so sick. - Thank you, Syd. - You're welcome. You're going to have a lot of follow-up appointments, but you've got to trust me, they're all going to make you completely well. - Okay. - Well, I guess I better hit the road. - Syd... - Yeah. I just... I want to thank you, for everything. - I'm glad I could help. - Okay. - Well, you guys, I'll see you soon, okay? - Okay. - I know you like her too, dad. I can tell these things. You think so? - I think you might be right. Syd. Syd? The doctor said that he... he got all the tumor. - Jake's going to have some chemo sessions for a while, but that's just a precautionary move. He shouldn't have any complications. - I don't think I could have handled losing Jake. - I know. - But last night, at the football field, you know, before the phone call... - Yeah. - It was... - special. - Yes. - For me too. - I don't think I can ever repay you, you know? For all you've done for Jake and me. - There is one way. - That love of your life that you never thought you'd get another chance with? - Yeah. Maybe if you ask her to stay, she will. Really? - But only if you really want her to. - Syd, I want her to stay. I want her to stay. - I see congratulations are in order. - Yep, I haven't smoked for a year. - Now, if we could just do something about this cholesterol level. We do have a title to defend, you know. - Yeah, I'm working on it, Helen. I'm working on it. - Okay. Nelson! - Yes. - Um... Are you taking those pills that Sydney prescribed? - Oh, yeah, Helen. And they work great. - We need to see you guys back in two weeks. - In two weeks. Okay, thanks. - Hey, sweetheart. - Hey. Everything all right? - It's perfect. - Everything's fine. Are you ok? - Oh, yeah, thanks. And those pills? They really work. - Oh, good. Yeah, if you're feeling any anxiety, just go ahead and take them. In fact, you can't take too many. - My husband the lawyer, always so worried about me. And the baby. Come on, big daddy. - Thanks, doc. - Uh-huh. - Thanks, Syd. - See you in two weeks. - What do you mean? He can't take too many what? - Sugar pills. - Oh! - Hi, hon. - Hey! There are my guys. - Hi there. - So, you ready for some lunch, mom? - Yes, I am. What are you hungry for? - Chili cheeseburger with fries. - Oh, my goodness. You think your tummy can handle that? - I think so. - You know what? So do I. - Well, that's just great. The town doctor and her family. How are we going to defend our title if you all go out and eat junk food? - Moderation, grandma. Everything in moderation. - Oh. Oh, I see. Well, in that case, bring me back a chili dog. - You got it. Come on. I'll see you for my 3:00. - And don't forget the onions!
