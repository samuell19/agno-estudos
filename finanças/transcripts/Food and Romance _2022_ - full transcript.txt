["Mes emmerdes" plays] [music in French] How's it going? I wanted to remind myself how I used to look. You're better looking now. No, I'm not, but at least my suit size is the same. -And I'm just as charming. -Stop it, Sten! -What can I do to help? -Put glasses out for the starter. Alright, I'll do that. -Oops. -There. Oops. Karin! 40 years and you still put them in that way. They don't get clean when you put them in point down. The points should be down or you'll hurt yourself. -No. -When will you learn that? I'll deal with the rest. Just go out there and make sure everything is in order. Okay, can I have some of this? I'm a bit peckish. -No, not that one. -Not that one? -Have some of this. -Okay, I'll have this one. I don't want this, or this… Oh no, is this blue cheese? -Yeah. -Yuck. Mm! Delicious! -Here you go. -Oh! -You're early. -Yeah I thought I'd come and help. Well, everything is already done, but thanks anyway. Mm-hmm. Do you think I look like Mum in this? No, Gunnel was a lot bigger. Pia… Gunnel was fat! You know that. But she was good looking. So good looking! -Fat and good looking! - [snickers] Karin, they're coming. The guests are coming. Why doesn't he just open the door? Pia… -They're coming! -We'll be right there! -Mm, that's nice. -Wow! Congratulations. Not many have stayed together for as long as you. And us of course. Sometimes you wonder whether it's really worth celebrating. There's always something to celebrate. Don't forget that. Here we are! -Pia wants some. -No, I'll wait. Let's go outside. Let's move down the garden. Please, enjoy some more nibbles. Bring the blankets. I'll be along with the starter soon. Hello? -Hello? -Hello, finally. Yeah, practice went late. They're struggling with canter strike offs. -I didn't have time to wrap it. -Oh, you're wearing a dress, you look lovely. That's a ruby flower. Oh… You know, ruby anniversary flower. Ah, I see, thank you. Wow. Thank you. I get such anxiety from parties. -I don't like it. -But parties are fun. Parties are fun when you're seven but not when you're turning 40. But you don't look 40. It's small comfort, I know. But you know, from now on, you're only getting uglier. That applies to all of us. You should celebrate when you have the chance to have a party. -And we have space for the party. -No. And I can sort out the food. No, Mum. I don't want a party. I thought I had made that clear. I'm going out to Dad. Today I've created a menu that means a lot to Sten and me. Oh? Okay. I'm just kidding. I've cooked the same menu we had at our wedding, 40 years ago. -Oh, wow. -A classic shrimp cocktail for starters. And then a baked salmon. And for dessert we have a cake, a surprise cake. It really is, cause I don't remember. But I remember the midnight snack! -We're having hot dogs! -Yes! -That's your favorite. -Yeah. It doesn't get better than that. There, help yourselves to some '80s nostalgia. Thank you. Can you pass the bread around? I'll just remove this. I'll be brief. I won't say too much. Thank you. Only kidding. -Cheers to our ruby anniversary. -Cheers. Now, dig in! -Here's to all of us. -Cheers. -Cheers! -Cheers! ♪ It's too late to turn back ♪ ♪ There's something I want to tell you ♪ You can even do rock climbing on some of the islands, they say it's amazing. I've climbed quite a lot actually. 90 degree walls. You were younger then. A lot younger. Sten, go get the digestif and I'll bring the cake. Cake! It's a matter of technique, it's in the fingers. I'll show you. I'll just show you some things. Just give me a minute. A LITTLE TASTE OF THINGS TO COME, NAUGHTY BOY. Here is perfect. Janne, hold my glasses. Alright, Fredrika, check out your dad. Alright, what the hell! This doesn't feel good. Go, Dad! -Home stretch, Dad! -You can do it! No, Sten, that's enough. Oh, Sten. Climb up the roof, Sten. Get down now, Sten. -Sten? -Dad? Call the ambulance. He's stable now. So go home and get some sleep. -Okay. -You need it. Let's do that. Everything will be fine. There you go, Naughty Boy. -Karin… -40 years. 40 fucking years! Don't you think I'm worth more than this? -Huh? -Karin, please. So who is it? How long has this been going on? I've been an idiot, I… Karin, I'll tell you who it is. Actually, don't. I don't want to know. I don't want to know who it is. I can't even look at you. Karin? Karin? Monika? Holy hotcakes, it's been a while! -You still live here? -Yeah. Mum doesn't have long left. She's over 90, so I do what I can to cheer her up. -So you've moved home again then? -No, no, it's just temporary. I have to mind Mum's house and then get it sold as quickly as possible. Small towns can be so incestuous. Just kidding. But hey, how long has it been? High school? My God we had so much fun together! Do you remember? We went straight from the party to our summer job at the hotel. My God we were hungover! We couldn't do that nowadays. I still work at the hotel. Oh. I don't know anyone here anymore and I'm dying of boredom in the evenings. Won't you come to mine for dinner tonight? And we'll catch up. I've got a lot going on right now so I don't think so, unfortunately. But thank you. I understand. You don't need to make up your mind now. You know where Mum's house is. Mm. Bye. See you tonight. Spray tan, huh? Yeah, the new one down on the High Street. They had opening deals, free sample. Isn't it a bit much? It'll settle. -Hey? -Yeah. -Do you remember Monika from school? -Who? -You know, the talkative one. -Oh yeah, the one who was a bit… Always had to be seen and heard. Stole all the oxygen. -A bit proggy. -Yes, exactly, her. Didn't she move away 100 years ago? I ran into her. She wanted me to come over for dinner. Why would you want to do that? I don't know. Oh sweetheart, it's you. How's Sten doing? We've been so worried, I tried to call you… He's still in hospital with a damaged vertebrate and a concussion. -Oh my God. -He's going to have an operation. -But he'll be okay? -Yeah, but it'll take time. He'll be there for a long time. -Poor Sten, say hi to him from us. -I'll do that. See you. Poor Sten. -Hi. -Yes, you came, great! -Here you go. -Oh… Homemade jam, that's not something I see a lot of. Thank you! I've made a reservation at a place in town that I've read about. Oh? And you're coming. Me? No. -Yes, you are. -No, no, no. -It'll be fun. Here's the taxi. -No, I… -No, I can't… -Yes! -Here? -Yes, come on. What? Come on. -Welcome, reservation for…? -Thank you, Monika and Karin. Hi Monika, hi Karin. Come on, let's go. Fantastic. Come with me. And then we have a nice, crispy gyoza. with toasted chilli, ginger sauce and gari ku, and fermented pak choi. That's delicious, we'll have that, we'll have those. I would recommend two to three dishes each, to share. Yes, three at least. -Three? -Yes, of course. Can we eat three? We'll find something. Karin, let's see what wine we're having. Oh, they have Gewürztraminer from France, 2014. It's a bit more pricey but that's what we're having, it's worth it. -Cheers, Karin. -Cheers. -It's so great to be here with you! -Cheers. We're having some trouble deciding because everything looks great, but we can start with the wine. If I say Gewürztraminer, France, 2014, what do you say?

No, I wouldn't say that. But I've worked in bars a lot. It's been very… It's been very all over the place, really. I've lived in Vietnam, I've lived in New Zealand. -No? -Yeah. But you know… you know… it's also some sort of restlessness. I feel some security in being able to move on whenever. Start a new life somewhere else. -Two more of these, please. -No! -Yes! -No! -Yes, of course! -No, I'm working tomorrow. Oh, it'll just do you good. -You know, I'm gonna tell you something. -You're dangerous. No, I'm not dangerous! You know what? I admired you when we were in school. Mm-hmm. -No. -Yes! -You admired me? -Yes! You were so popular, you knew what you wanted, you were really hot. -You still are. -No… Didn't you want to work with food? Yeah… I really liked cooking and I… -It was my dream to work with food… -Thanks. -Thanks. -You're welcome. Then I got pregnant really young and… -I couldn't combine those two things. -No… Karin.

Karin, come on, let's sign up. -Yes. -No, on Tuesdays I swim with Pia. That Pia? Come on, you could swim any day. No, we can't because the pool isn't open any other day. -And also… -I'm going to this, I don't want to miss this. It's bloody Henrik Moliner, Karin! Taxi! Taxi! The prognosis is looking very good, Sten. In a week, we'll move you to rehabilitation. Wow, that's great, then you'll be home soon. And when you're discharged you'll get a walker and a wheelchair. For longer excursions. A walker and a wheelchair, that's perfect. What part of this is perfect? It'll be great, you'll get to come home. I'll get you an ice-cream. What course? Advanced pan-Asian cooking. Advanced? Pan? Yeah. What? There's something fishy going on here. Sten is in hospital and suddenly you're taking some course… What the hell. Taking a course in "pan". I haven't said I'm taking a course. I've said that there is a course on Tuesdays when we usually swim. Right, so you just want to generally inform me about a course on Tuesdays when we usually swim. In that case I'd like to inform you that on Wednesdays I usually do the washing and Ystad college has a course on bobbin lace. Hey there! -Hi. -Karin told me you swim on Tuesdays, but there's a course next week so we'll have to do a different day. -We? -Yes, you're coming. To be in a crowd of strangers and cooking fumes? Thanks, but no thanks. Hey there, by the way, it's been a while. -You haven't changed. -Neither have you. This is going to be fun!

I'll tell you right away that I can't even boil an egg. Last time I tried it went moss green. Do you think you'll learn that here? [in English] I hope so. -[all laugh] -[in Swedish] I actually applied for this course because I thought I might meet a girl or two. -But… that might have been a bad idea. -[laughs] [in English] No offence, [in Swedish] but I'm a little age conservative. Holy hotcakes, here he is. For fuck's sake, get it into your head, I can't do it! I can't bloody well turn down an offer like that at my age. In Tokyo! That's right. You can't force me to give these damn courses. Hell no. I'm a chef! I'll speak to you later. Bye. -Have you introduced yourselves? -Yes. Good. There are four stations, so take your places. Can we work together? -Karin? -She's with me. Yeah, so… -[whispering] -Okay. [whispering] My name is Henrik Moliner but you'll call me Chef. -Yes, Chef. -Thank you. I've worked internationally for years, I've run Michelin restaurants, I've received a number of awards and distinctions. But I started my career doing dishes. I was 19 years old, worked my way up pretty quickly. You can do that if you can put in a thousand hours a week and decide that you're going to achieve your dreams. -Yes. -Passion is the driving force of every art form. -Yes. -And to me cooking is just that, art. [Tomas] Yes. [Henrik] These are the rules that apply in my kitchen. First up, hygiene. Hygiene and hygiene. I want things in order, no unnecessary talking and no phones, please. -Okay. -I demand focus and discipline and I want you to respect the ingredients. The end result will never be better -than your ingredients. -Mm-hmm, true. [Henrik] Alright, let's get our recipes for tonight. We will be making nigiri with avocado, shiso and ponzu. Then we have gyoza with tofu, ginger, smoked soy and go chu jang. -Finally, we'll have s… -Gyoza, what's that? It's those steamed and fried dumplings. -Why doesn't he just say that? -Shh! Excuse me, may I continue? Sple.. shple.. Please, go ahead. All necessary ingredients are in the cool-room behind you there. Further down is the dry storage but I don't want any running around. And read the recipes first and ask questions after. Got it? -Yes, Chef. -Absolutely. -[in English] Yes, sir. -Thank you. -Let's get started. -I'll start on the sake marinade. -Pia, what do you think? -That'll be great. -Does he think we're in preschool? -Shh! Yeah, but don't reveal our secret. Our tactics. Hey, the competition starts… Now! ["Mal ô mains" plays] Be inspired by Asian food culture. Visual presentation and flavor in exquisite balance. Every detail has exquisite and absolute importance. -Just like in life. -Yes, Chef. And don't forget, nigiri should be small and delicate. If you want to eat rice you can go to the Thai joint down the street. Mise en place! A tom kha gai soup is elevated with fish sauce but too much can ruin the whole thing. What does he mean, elevate? Fuck! -What? -Sorry. Yes. Archive. -Pardon? -Throw that shit out! And start over. -Tempo, tempo! -Yeah, okay. -No, I couldn't. -Yes, take them. Oh, can I try? Can I try? Shit. What did I say about phones? Oh come on… No chatting. Focus. Mise en place! Everybody, tempo, tempo, tempo! Yes, Chef. Have you thought about what tone -you're using when you talk to people? -Excuse me? Of course. You're excused. -It looks fantastic! -Beautiful! -Did you do that? -I'll try it, then. With an old, well preserved Chevy, you can get across the continent in a couple of weeks. First New York, then along the east coast to Philly, then down to DC and after that Miami, New Orleans, Houston, it's a hell of an experience, I'll tell you that. -It sounds lovely. -Yeah. When did you do that? I've never been there. But one day. [in English] I'm going there. -How do you eat these? -But it'd be good to have someone with me. Have you been to Ibiza? Have I been to Ibiza? -I've been there many times. -It's the best place. -Name a place she hasn't been. -You've been to Ibiza, Monika? -Yes. -I want details. -This one is amazing. -Mm-hmm… No, you've heard enough of my life now, you'll hear more another time. You didn't follow the recipe. No. I experimented a bit and I usually just go by feel. Right, well here you follow my instructions. Don't forget that. That's it for tonight, let's hope for a better result next week. He was so strict! No, there needs to be discipline. -Bye. -Bye. There has to be discipline in a restaurant kitchen. Discipline? What about having fun? -Hang on, I'll be right back. -Okay. I'm just here to tell you that I quit. Oh? You can transfer the course fee to this account. And why are you quitting? Because cooking should be fun, not a punishment. If you want to have fun I suggest you go to the amusement park. Good, I like roller coasters. Bye. Wait, wait. It's possible I sounded a bit too irritated tonight but that's largely because of the level of this group… You were grumpy, unpleasant and aggressive. We've paid way too much money to be shouted at. And why are you running a cookery course when you don't like cooking? Or people, apparently. Occupational hazard I guess. Clearly. Alright, I guess we'll send this money back. You can hold off on that. I'll give you one more chance. -What… -Good luck. You two need to understand how restaurant culture works. There is no democracy in a restaurant kitchen. I know that, but this is a course, I'm not his employee. You disrespect him when you improvise and when you two giggle. Honestly, just relax. If you're taking an advanced course like this you should take it seriously, that's all I'm saying. I think the mood is getting a bit weird in the pool, Monika. I take food seriously. And I've worked restaurants a fair bit so I know what I'm talking about. What's going on with you? I'm sorry. I'm so bloody stupid and rude. You're not stupid. Mum died last night. Oh, Monika. Oh, dear. She's all I had. And now she's gone. I am… I am so bloody stupid. I didn't think I would miss her. You should have called us and we would have come over. She was over 90 so it's not a surprise. No, you probably don't need to write the cause of death in the obituary. No. You're so lucky to have your families, that's real love and companionship. Not some bloody make-believe. We're not all that bloody happy. What's wrong, Karin? I know you. Something's happened that you're not telling us. What do you mean? It feels like it anyway. Sten is in hospital and you never talk about it. What are you saying? Has something else happened in your family? -What? What's up with my family? -Yeah. Should I apologize for having a family? I know it bothers you. Okay… If it bothers me it's because I think you work as a service for Sten and Fredrika. -Okay. -Hmm. What about Bosse? He left for Stockholm with his colleague, she was 15 years younger. What the hell does that have to do with this? I'm just telling it like it is. -But now your kids live there too. -That's right, they do. With functional families and excellent careers. How is Fredrika doing these days? -In the stable. -She's doing well. At least we don't fight like you and your kids every time you're on the phone. Come on, stop this. Life is what it is. Nobody's life is perfect. Yes. My life is completely bloody perfect. Sten… Sten is cheating on me. -What? -What? I accidentally saw a text and a photo on his phone. A lovely photo where the secret sender was… Oh, Karin… Why haven't you said anything? Who the hell would want to sleep with Sten? I'm sorry for saying that. [all laugh] We should form the association of failures. But we do already have a little club. The Tuesday Club. You guys… we'll look after each other. The Tuesday Club. Tuesday Club. Maybe you can start the club by pouring some water on the aggregate, please. Holy hotcakes, you scared me! Once again. -What do you call thinly sliced raw fish? -Sashimi! -To marinate in rice vinegar and sugar? -Pickle. -How do you spell salt? -S-O-Y. -Japanese spice mix? -Togarashi. What do we call a microwave? -Chernobyl. -Barsebäck. Alright, today's dishes: We're making bao buns with pork belly and hoisin, as well as a salad and tuna tartar. And then Indonesian spring rolls, it's pretty easy so hopefully one of you can manage it tonight. -Get to it! -Yes, Chef! Let's see here, get the sugar and sesame seeds if you can find that over there. -Are you having fun now? -Mm. I just can't find the barbecue spice mix, do you have that? Sorry, I was joking, I forgot that's not allowed. You're excused, but work on the humor. What? No balance at all, read the recipe and start again. Okay. Oh, you… Fuck! It's cool, it's cool! -We're done, we're first! -Yes! -Have you hurt yourself? -No. No, I've had my nails done. The new salon on the High Street. It looks a bit complicated. You just have to use the whole hand. It's not that difficult. -Fuck! -[spits] [grunts] Fuck! For the archive… Calm down. I'll teach you some tricks. Two ladles of this and let it set. Okay? Gold star for stubbornness and patience. And then it's like hey, ho… Nice one, Pia. [women scream] [Grizzly] Hold that door! Hold that… With Sashimi… I angle the knife… and slice with a long sweeping motion. That's why I said, "Now I'm in America". I'm just ranting. I haven't actually got anything to say. -Don't cheat! -One, two, three, hey! -Wow, looks great. -We've done so well. -I hope it tastes as good as it looks. -Now we're talking. -So nice. -Darling, you've done this so well. -So where did you meet? -It was at Mykonos. I'd rented a place in the mountains to finish my dissertation. Or that was the idea. And suddenly one day, there he was. I was supposed to be running a tantra yoga course, but it turned out a bit more like the Kama Sutra. Let's put it this way, we didn't sleep a wink that week. [all laugh] Henrik, have you got a wife? -Or a husband? -No. Oh no. Sorry. [horse neighs] We're learning pan-Asian food. It's a bunch of little dishes, the next more complicated than the last. And it's such a fun mix of people. One guy is called Grizzly and he's completely obsessed with the US. And then there's a professor, Clarence and his partner, Tomas who's a yoga instructor. And then there's the three of us. The Tuesday Club, we call ourselves. Monika, Pia and I. -The Tuesday Club? -Mm. -What are you, twelve? -[horse neighs] I'm sorry Mum, I'm not really that interested in your new pastime. Dad is in hospital. He needs your support and your time. Hey, you're awake, great. Hi… you finally came. So… soon I'll be home again. This is no five star hotel. The food is disgusting… I wish I could order in luxury catering. Or your food. Yeah. Good lord, she was such a hoarder, my mum. I'll sell and head off when the course is finished. Oh. There you go. I, myself, plan to retreat into normal everyday life. Just being and enjoying life. Yeah, life goes on. Or we start a catering business. Tuesday Club Catering. That's a fantastic idea! So, wait… We'll be cooking? Yes, we will. But we'll only cook good food, stuff we like to eat and make. Colorful and inspiring food. Well, good food. Okay, I'll be a bit negative now but do you know how competitive the catering business is? Do you think the three of us could handle that? Yes. I think we could do it. Tuesday Club Catering. [message tone] This is what I'm thinking the website might look like. -Can you see the pictures now, Karin? -Yes, it looks great. -But it's not our food. -We just need to practice. Panko? What's that? -Mum doesn't have that. -Use something else then. -You've got to have something. -Bread crumbs, will that work? I want to be CEO. We should probably ask Clarence to go over the finances first. That shouldn't be a problem. -[cheering] -[laughter] [knocking] Karin, can you help me with a booking? We provide fresh, aromatic food. Genuinely Swedish with a touch of Asian here and there. [Pia] Where is that Asian store? -I think we need to go in there. -Let's go right here. -Are you sure about this? -Oh, stop. We could've just gone to the supermarket at home, they have great stuff. [Karin] This will be great. I think Grandma had some fun herring recipe. -Here it is. -We're not making granny food, are we? No but we're getting inspiration, genuinely Swedish, and then we add our own touch. What do you think we should cook? Sausage and mash? No, but not everything has to be so fancy. Karin says it does. Yeah, but that's just to impress Henrik. What? We're so bloody good! Can I put this here? Just put them there. Where did you learn to cook? No, I… I did dream of becoming a chef when I was younger. But then I had children really young and life got in the way. It usually does. I did submit an idea for a cookbook once. -No… -It was turned down. My recipes were probably very strange. I experimented a lot. You should try again. Don't you think? No, I think I might be afraid of failing. We all are. But for someone who's afraid of failure… you're brave in the kitchen. -Welcome to Sweden's Master Cock… Cook! -[Karin laughs] [men laugh] -Chef. -Did you really… [all laugh] Oh no, I forgot my scarf… Can you order something for me? -You forgot this. -Yeah, I was just… -Thank you. -You're welcome. This course, I… I've really learnt a lot. Me too. Yes… I can't believe there's only one more session left. Will you run more courses? No, I… I think it was a mistake to move home again after all these years. Everything has changed, I've changed. I don't belong here. I'm sorry. I'm married. I'm sorry. And there I am, with kids and everything that needs looking after. Here you go. -Pia is telling me about her divorce. -Right. But have you met someone else? No, I'm done with all that. Not much passion towards the end, -with your ex? -No… -Hello? -Where are you? Oh God, yeah, I've overslept. -No, I don't need a wheelchair. -Yes. Let's sit you down. -You can put your feet here. -Hi. Hi Karin, here you go. -Oh. -It's the same as your bridal bouquet. -I haven't forgotten. -Thanks, they're nice. Thanks. Have you rearranged the furniture? Yes. What have you done? -Why did you move this here? -Just leave it. It's fine there. It's so nice and airy now. I was lucky, Karin. -It could have been much worse. -I know. Thank you. I'll get the coffee. -Damn. -You can borrow this. You might not have as much time as usual. Chernobyl. -What did you say? -Fredrika? -I need help to… -Mum's coming, I have to go to the stables, Dad. Okay. You'll love this. -Bye, Dad. -Bye. That looks delicious. It's so lovely to be home again. With you. You haven't seen my book, have you? -Which one? -It's usually here, on my table. What's it called? I don't remember, but it's a crime novel. -Who wrote it? -One of those famous ones, -I don't really remember. -Mm. -This one? -No, that's not it. But it doesn't matter. All my golf magazines are gone too, but that doesn't matter either. But it would be nice if you knew where my reading glasses are. -Tada. -Ah, that's great. -There. -Thanks, Karin. Ow, it hurts so much. Hey… Karin, I… I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband. I know that, but… maybe I haven't been the absolute worst? 40 years. Hey? You don't just throw that away. No… Exactly. [sighs] I need you. I need you, Karin, I know that now. I believe you need me, too. Can we try? We can look at this as a fresh start. We'll try to… Together. Who knows, maybe we can emerge stronger from this, on the other side. What do you say to that? Karin, please. I'll get the milk. Oh. [sighs] -Good morning. -Morning. [in English] The castle is over here but the bus station is to the right and then left -and then you'll see the bus station. -Can I get to the fortress first? -Oh, you want to go to the fortress? -I want to visit it. I want to look at it. Um… Sofie. [in Swedish] I've got to dash. -[in English] Right. -Oh, okay. Hi, Sir, can I help you? -Hey! -Hi! -Hey, Karin, I've done the sums on this. -Oh. Take it for what it is. In the end it's all about your idea, okay? -Mm-hmm. -Here you go. -Thank you. -What's that? Karin asked me to look over your business idea so I ran some numbers. A budget. But this is all negative. Are you okay? I'm fine. It's nothing. Or… We've been talking about starting a catering business. Monika, Pia and I. -Wow. -But it'll never work. Clarence did the budget and it was very clear. I just really wanted it to work. Listen, if you've made me have fun in the kitchen again, if you've succeeded in that, you can do anything, Karin. Clarence's budget… to hell with it… [laughs] I don't know. I… And now the course is finished too. Don't give up, not now. If you really want something, you can do it. Okay? And if you need my help, or just want to talk, you know where to find me. [Pia] It's just not pretty. [Clarence] Yes! -It looks great. -You must have learnt something. [Tomas] Careful with the mango, it goes mushy. [indistinct chattering] Listen up everyone. I was thinking, since this is the last time we're together… [Grizzly] Yes! [all applaud] -Grizzly! -Grizzly! -Woo-hoo! -[cheering] Holy hotcakes, it's the last time, who's coming out to celebrate? -Me! -You, you, you, you… [lively music plays] -Really? -What, did you… -Yeah… -Cheers. First New York, then along the east coast to Philadelphia, then to Miami… -Me neither. -Oh. -Oh, not for me. -Thanks. -No, one more song! -No, I really have to go. -We'll have this, then we'll dance. -Cheers! -["All Night Long (All Night)" plays] -♪ All night long ♪ ♪ yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ -♪ All night long ♪ -♪ All night, all night ♪ -♪ All night long ♪ -♪ All night, all night ♪ ♪ Oh, no ♪ ♪ All night long ♪ ♪ All night, all night yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Everyone's dancing their troubles away ♪ ♪ All night, all night all night, all night ♪ ♪ Come join our party and see how we play ♪ ♪ All night long, all night, all night yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ All night long, all night, all night ♪ ♪ All night long, all night, all night oh, no ♪ ♪ All night long, all night, all night yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ [metal clanging] Karin, are you coming?

Always something going on. -Karin helps me. -Yeah. -But you're on painkillers now? -Oh yeah, absolutely. So… you can't walk at all? Yes, I can walk. I've got this lovely thing, it works.

Holy hotcakes, we went with your suggestion. Tuesday Club Catering. What about the finances? You saw it, it was all negative. -Yeah, but we… -Karin? We'll worry about that later, for now we'll just brain storm and have fun. I think we should meet up every Tuesday and try recipes and plan and… Karin, HP sauce, please. HP. -HP sauce, there. -Are you still there? -I'm sorry, Monika, I can't do Tuesday. -HP sauce. What? Is it Sten? Can't Fredrika be with him? Fredrika trains kids in dressage so she can't. -Thank you. -Listen to me now. Let's meet up on Tuesday, 6:30. I've found the perfect place. I don't think I can do Tuesday, I don't think so, I'm sorry. Hey, Karin… could I bother you for some napkins too? Monika, I can't. I have to focus on my family now. -Hey, Karin. -Talk to you later. -Thank you. -Mm-hmm. -Hey, Karin. -Yeah? Thank you. Really, thank you. For the food and everything. -Hey, Daddy -Hey, Sweetheart. -Hello. -Hi. These ready meals were on special offer, isn't that good? I know you're a big snob about processed foods but it's for your own good. Dad wouldn't dare tell you but he loves those. -Hey… -Mm. You haven't changed your mind about your birthday? I could make a little buffet or something simple. No, I'm not doing anything. But you're turning 40, that's worth celebrating. Don't you remember Camilla's birthday? Ingela threw a party for her and it was very simple and very nice. Yes, but they have a very different mother-daughter relationship than we do. What do you mean? I mean, they're friends. They have common interests. You have your interests, you're here, fiddling in the kitchen. It's not like with me and Dad. I guess. Okay… -Oh, come on… -Yep… Well then… then… It works out well that I'm going out tonight. We're planning our catering business. Tonight? Yes, exactly, I forgot. So you can look after Dad. You've got plenty of food, or you can just let this stew simmer for 30 minutes. Otherwise the microwave's there. Okay… -Where are you going? What's going on? -She's going off to start some business. Right, that catering thing. But Karin, you need to have a business plan. Yeah, and permits and equipment and stuff. Yeah and a startup capital, we don't have that kind of money. -Exactly. -I might be back late. -Hey! You came, welcome! -Hey! -Hi! -Come in! -What is this? -Come. -Come on. -I don't understand… Look, we've already bought everything. A lot of carrying. No… What is this? Where are… -I don't understand, what is this? -Hi. What are you doing here? -I live here. -We forgot to tell you that part. Henrik will be our mentor. Not bad, hey? -Okay. -Yes. Take your coat off and let's get started. Karin. -How does it taste? -Hmm, a little bit more honey. But how much did you just put in? I have to write it down. So, this idiot, he said, "All those curves, and here I am without any brakes." -No… -Yes, I promise. That's what I'm saying, they're all idiots, can we stop talking about men now? -Yes. -Yes, please. The flavors are everything. -Yeah, they have to be right! -Exactly! Oh, that smells good. Listen, I have… I made something. What is it? -Oh, Pia. -Are you kidding? -Oh, Pia. -Karin, here you go. -Pia, they're perfect! -Did you make these? Yes, I did! -Oh my God. -And for "Yes, Chef". But you can only borrow yours. Can we take a picture? -Cheese! -Hey! What? And you're meant to be the pro. -[laughs] -[indistinct] -Ooh wee, wee, wee -[all laugh] [Pia] Go on, put it in. This tastes like dishwater. No! It actually works. Yeah, maybe it gets you high. Does it? -Hey there. -Hey. [Pia] Oh God, I'm dying! You should have started a catering business a long time ago. But you have to have a business plan and do a budget and… And why wouldn't you be able to do that? Huh? Huh? So many idiots own their own businesses these days. Thanks for that. That's not what I meant, I'm sorry. I meant idiots like me. When I am… nervous like I am now. I'm sorry, but I've tried to reach you so many times. I've called you… And I know I shouldn't have. You're married. I just don't know how this works. I have somehow forgotten how it works. It's been a long time. -Thank you for a wonderful evening. -Thank you. I should be thanking you. I am… I'm glad you came. -Me too. -Mm. Don't go. -No. -I want a life with you. This can't happen, I can't do this. I can't do this, you can't just… You can't just leave someone you've been with for 40 years. I understand. -I can't do that. -I know, I'm sorry. Forgive me. Forgive me. [door closes] [sentimental music plays] Sten? Sten? -Mm? -Sten, I'm home. -I'm home. -Mm. -Hey there. -Hi. -Down here. Do you see? -Yes. Careful. I was thinking we could take a scythe down and… -Help, are you okay? -Yes, I'm fine. -I have an idea about this area. -Yeah. -In the alcove over here. -Yes, I'm coming. Fredrika? -Aren't you Karin's daughter? -[coughs] Yes. Hi. -Hi. -I'm Monika. Yeah… -Has something happened? -[sobs] -I turn 40 on Saturday. -Oh. And all other 40-year-olds… are busy with their families and their kids. -Kids! I don't even want kids! -No. -Why do you have to have kids? -No. I'm just a serial dater and the last guy I was seeing dumped me. A bloody civil engineer who couldn't even reverse a horse trailer. No… -Yes… -[church bells chime] I give up. Oh… Couples' dinners and kids all over the place. Don't bother with that. You're lucky to miss it. -Yeah. -Yeah. Oh, dear. May I guess what he was like in bed, that civil engineer? A bit, you know, standard Swedish car service, right? -Exactly. -Mm. -Check, check, check. -[imitates a male orgasm] [laughs] -I can't do this anymore. -Yes, you can. -It'll be alright. -40 years old. We'll sort that out. [laughs] -What is this? -[both laugh] [indistinct dialogue] What? -Oh my God. -You have stuff everywhere! Yeah… Oh God, look at this. Aw. Look at me here. -What? -Yeah. -Is this you? -Yes. -No, stop, so hot! -Yes. And here I am. -Wow, look. -Little girl. You've travelled so much. Well I… You know, that picture is from Buenos Aires. I was working at a cocktail bar with my fiancé at the time. -You're joking. -Oh no, did I say "my fiancé at the time"? -What am I, a hundred years old? -[both laugh] And look at this. -I made this when I went to preschool. -It's so ugly! You're a slow drinker, oh dear. -You've met so many people. -Mm-hmm. That I have. [laughs] And I can't even put together a guest list for my 40th birthday party. No, let's not start crying again. No, no… Yes. -Yes, yes. -If I'm even having a party. Of course you're having a party. Hey. Of course you're having a party, we'll sort it out. Come on, it'll be hard to make it work but we'll take in extra staff and it'll be fine. -Okay? -No, I don't want to. Of course you do! It'll be so much fun! Hey! Come on, here you go. Here you are. There you go. Not a word to Karin about this. There you go. [sighs] Meh. The butter knife is in the marmalade. -I'll get a new one. -No, you don't need to do that. -Yes, I will. -Just leave it! -Don't use that tone with me. -What tone? [knocking on the window] Hello. -Hi. -Hey. I'm having a 40th birthday party. We'll do it after all. -Oh! -Yes, on Saturday, in the barn behind the stables, you're invited. You don't have to do anything, you can come as guests. -Fun, right? -That's great. And I've invited your boring friends so that'll be lots of fun. -[both laugh] -Um. -I'm so excited! -Yeah. Um. Great. I'm going to work now but… -I'll talk to you later, bye. -Bye. -Don't you want a coffee or something? -No thanks! Wow. [country music plays] Alright, quickly now! -Here comes the party! -Let's go! [in English] Wait for me. Oh, wow. -Look! -Look at all this! Wow! Look, a saloon! [Fredrika] Dad! Dad! Honey! -40 years old! -40 years old! -Happy birthday. -Put that there. What is my cooking group doing here? Monika sorted it out. Come! We're line dancing. You can put your coats there. Yeah! [in English] Howdy! Howdy. [in Swedish] Eyelash extensions. Down on the High Street. They overdid it a bit but it was a trainee so it was free. Come on! So, what about you? How… Are you interested in stocks, do you own stocks? -Stocks? -Yeah. No, I don't know… [indistinct chatter] Three, four! -My sister has two kids, -Yeah… they get both a weekly allowance and a monthly allowance. So the weekly allowance they can spend how they want, but the monthly allowance is long term savings. The point is… -It's damn clever, really. -Yeah… She's clever there, cause they get both a weekly and a monthly allowance. The weekly allowance they can spend how they want, the idea with the monthly one is that it will grow. But I think that's good, it's good to think like that. -Cause then they can… -Line dance! Come! -No, I can't. -Yes! Mum, let's dance! -No, I can't. -Yes! Go on. -Yes, come on! -No, I can't. -Stand here. -No. -Hey. -Hi. -Stand there, and just watch her feet. -Her? Okay. -Are you interested in stocks? -In what? Come on, aren't you dancing? No. What is it? Well, how are you? I'm good. It's a lovely party. Mm-hmm. Are you happy? I'm happy for Fredrika. Aren't you going to talk to Henrik? Why would I talk to Henrik? Huh? No, let's go inside and dance some more. -Come. -Karin, are you happy? Please, Pia, can you drop it? Drop it. -What do you want? -Well, what do you really want? We have to resist, Ingela. Karin has done everything for me. She keeps the family together, -she does everything. -I know. And I think of Karin, I think of Karin and I think of Janne. I think of them all the time. Ingela, I love you but I can't do that to Karin. I know. I know. What we have… Sten… Don't go. Thank you, Monika for sorting this out. -Fredrika is so happy! -Mm-hmm. -She is. -What are you thinking, are you selling the house? Who wants to live in a battered old house in a small town? Other than me that is. I'm staying. Because I like it here. -You're staying? -Yes! And we have the catering business. But we don't have any startup capital. We have to be realistic, Monika. But guys, what can you get for a kidney? Because I'll consider getting sedated just to solve the problem. It turns out, Mum had a talent for investing. And what do I need an inheritance for?

Where are you going? No, I'm just… finding Dad because then we have to call it a night. It's been a wonderful evening. I saw you coming out of the stable with that chef. Oh, right… That's right. -That's right? -That's right. Are you cheating on Dad? Are you cheating on Dad? -[sighs] -That's fucking disgusting! You're 60 years old, how horny can you be? Go off to the stable to fuck at my birthday party! Fucking disgusting, you've ruined everything! Calm down. Karin hasn't ruined anything. You can go home. Go home. -I… -Go home! -Fredrika. -You don't know her! Go home! I don't want to see you here. You've ruined our entire family! -Get out of here! -Okay. Hey… You've had someone your whole life who's been there for you. How do you think this feels? Now I know why you didn't come to the hospital, you were fucking that bloody chef! That's enough! I've taken care of you and Dad, but it's always him you see. None of what I do is seen. Dad drove you to the stable, that's what he did. Then I did the rest, even though I also worked full time! Not only are you cheating on Dad, you're slagging him off, too. Dad didn't do anything! I'm the one who's dedicated my life to washing your riding clothes, polishing your riding boots. Every weekend, I watched your competitions in the cold, getting UTIs I've made coffee and sold those rubbery hot dogs to the point of insanity. Do you think that was always fun? Do you? I could've done what I dreamt of doing. But I couldn't. Why, do you think? Because I had to take care of you and Dad. Grow up, you're 40! This is my life and I do whatever the fuck I want.

[Sten] Fredrika? [song ends] [piano music] [dial tone] [Henrik] Hi Karin, it's me. I just wanted to see if everything is okay. I'm on my way to the airport. I'm going to Japan again. It's probably best for both of us if I leave. I wish you all the best. Bye. [phone hangs up] [man on the radio] I say this without really knowing, but I think they're very popular. [woman on the radio] Yes, in a way. In sweet dishes. But we're still quite restrictive in how we use them. They're starting to crop up in other things. We used a lot of cardamom, cinnamon, sugar saffron. To us it became sweet buns, a luxury. Sugar was luxurious, the spices were luxurious. -We made a luxurious bun. -[man] Mm-hmm And we have it in cooking, but maybe not that much. With cinnamon, I'm still pretty conservative, I haven't discovered cinnamon, I haven't explored it in the same way… Trot! Trot! Good, nice. Eyes forward. Chest up. You can all keep that in mind. Good. [horse neighs] [Karin] Hi. I thought we could have a coffee. I've baked. Oh? Does it have coconut in? Of course. Come. I didn't mean to hurt you. Nothing is your fault. It's very important that you know that. When you have a choice… This cookery course came along… It was really great, that it came along. Without your course I wouldn't have met Monika and without Monika there wouldn't have been a party. It's good. Suddenly you grew up. And I was just stuck there. With Dad. Mm. You know what, I get that. I get it. I'm 40 now, you know. [both laugh] It must be some kind of torture to be with someone from when you're 20 and for the rest of your life. I guess that depends. [coughs] Why do people congratulate you on your ruby anniversary? People should be comforting you. -And offer their condolences. -Mm. Dress in black. [both laugh] I'm sorry, Mum. I'm sorry. For what? For not seeing everything you've done and for taking you for granted. That's how it is with mums sometimes. Oh God, I have to tell you something, but I don't know what to say. Mm… I'll just say it. I saw Dad and Ingela making out at the party. Ingela and Dad? When I think about it they've probably been together for a while. [exhales] Mm. [lively music plays] Wait, what? Karin, what's going on? Help! You have to tell me now, where are we going? Karin, stop! Karin, stop now! This isn't fun anymore. No, no, no. No. You can have him. Here you go. He loves you and you love him, and I… I like you both. Bye. [soft piano music] [Karin] Cheers to us. Cheers. [all] Mm. -Mm. -Mm. -Good. -Mm, mm. There you go… Yeah… -It felt good. -Mm? [engine accelerates] [lively music] Holy hotcakes, we are very late. For the protocol, it wasn't me that double booked us this time. I know, it's a bit of a mess. It's good to be working again and we got a bit of time off from each other. Yes, and that's lucky because we are booked up until Christmas. So I have to put up with you two every day. -You really love us. -[all laugh] Admit it! TUESDAY CLUB CATERING -Oh. -Ready. Oh my God. We've only got two hours to go. We will make it. I'll have time to chill the Champagne before you can say holy hotcakes. I almost can't walk. I'll show you pictures later. -It was totally crazy. -I also had a crazy time. -Oh, I can't imagine. -Totally insane. Come on Karin we have to hurry. Oh, holy hotcakes. Listen guys, you know what? I have talked to both my son and daughter and my grandchildren. -That's lovely! -Good. I'm going to visit them in Stockholm and I won't be angry. We're having lunch, all of us. Bosse will be there too. -My ex, you know. -Yeah. And we'll be like one big lovely family, which apparently is so popular these days. My, we've laughed. I haven't ridden since '87. I've had a daughter. [laughs] -Or well, pretend daughter, but still. -Mm. Cute. Becoming a mother at 60+, everyone's dream. You can't have too many mums. -No. -Yes. -There, get this out there. -Yes. And this. There, I'll get the rest later. -Hurry up. -Let's go. Are the flavors right? It's very salty. What are you doing here? I couldn't sit on the other side of the globe, knowing you were still here, so… I tried to forget you. I tried to not think about you but I couldn't help it. -Day and night. -Mm. So I'm back. To be with the most beautiful, the warmest, funniest… …and the most talented person I have ever met. I'm not going to give you up, Karin.
