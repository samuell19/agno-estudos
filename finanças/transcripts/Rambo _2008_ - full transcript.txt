Which was something they had never seen... which liberated a yellow, very pungent and acrid vapor. The actions of the hard line military regime are the cause... of increasing international concern. The regime crushes all dissent. Ethnic groups are being oppressed in the East of the country... and foreign journalists are rarely... Tonight that some form of chemical weapon has been used in Burma... -by military rule... -...Has led the national uprising. Thousands took the streets and thousands were killed in Burma. Many peaceful protesting monks have been killed, some burned alive... and others drowned. Foreign journalists have been shot and killed. As thousands of villages have been destroyed. Rape and torture are a daily occurrence. In Burma, there are more landmines than anywhere in the world. Young men are beaten and forced into the Army. Many as young as 12 years old. Beheadings and mutilations are commonplace. The Karen people, comprised mostly of poor Christian farmers... have been singled out for extermination. Military government wants the abundant natural resources on Karen land. The bloody Burmese military campaign against the Karen people... has been going on for almost sixty years. The longest running civil war in the world. Okay, the first man here is the number one in Thailand. He is very, very dangerous, number one. Two snake that you see... that are snake cobra or common cobra. It is not Kin Cobra and not Spittin Cobra. Hey, he!!- Where have you been? Give him the ba. We need another Python. See what you can do. We have enough Cobras, okay'? Fuck off, okay? The next one, number two... still have venom and still have poison. He is Thailand's number one. King Cobra, number two. They're called Spitting Cobra because they spit poison to your eye. One hour. He is very, very dangerous. Number one in Thailand. Careful, my friend. Looks like danerous work. I'm Michael Burnett. Do you have some time to talk? It won't take Ion, I promise. I was told it miht be possible to rent your boat. We'd like to do that. Is that possible? We need to et upriver. - Where you oin? -lnto Burma. Burma's a war zone. Well, that's what people call it, but it's more like enocide than war. Anyway, this will be my fifth trip in, so, we are aware of all the risks. I don't o that far North. Let me explain our situation. Our church is part of a Pan-Asian Ministry, located in Colorado. We're all volunteers, who around this time of year... brin in medical supplies, medical attention... prayer books and support for the Karen tribes people. People say you know the river better than anyone. - Well they lied. -So what I'm askin... is that we compensate you for a few hours of your time... that will help chane people's lives. - Are you brinin in any weapons? -Of course not. You're not chanin anythin. Well... It's... it's thinkin like that, that keeps the world the way it is. Fuck the world. - Let's o. -Why? He's not interested. Let's... let's just o. - Let me try. -Look, Sarah. I don't... Didn't you say it's the only way up there? - I know I did. But I've already told... -No, wait, then what do we have to lose? - I talked to the man and... -Just let me try, Michael. - Sarah? -Please. Hello? I'm Sarah Miller. I hope you don't mind me comin back here. - Uh, the man that you were talkin to... -I wasn't talkin to anybody. All riht, the man that was talkin to you... asked if we could hire you to take us up the river. - You said no. Why? -Can't help you out. Well, if you have ood reasons, would you mind if I heard them? Go home. Please, not my son! These boys are now our soldiers! They belon to me now! If you try to et them back, your whole villae will burn! If you ask the Karen Rebels for help, I will cut out your tonues! If you o aainst me I will feed you... your intestines! Hear me, believe me and fear me! Why'd you come back? Waiting for you. I told you before, I can't help you. We need to o and help these people. We're here to make a difference. We believe all lives are special. - Some lives, some no. -Really? If everyone thouht like you, nothin would ever chane. - Nothin does chane. -Of course it does! Nothin stays the same. Live your life, because you ot a ood one. It's what I'm tryin to do. No, what you're tryin to do is chane what is. And what is? Go home. Really. Go home. Maybe, maybe you've lost your faith in people. But you must still be faithful to somethin. You must still care about somethin. Maybe we can't chane what is. But tryin to save a life isn't wastin your life, is it? As bad as these people are, they will eventually lose. They can't keep it up aainst a united front. They can't. I mean, time alone will only tell, but... in the meantime, we just have to help hold it toether. I mean, just the other day I read... Excuse me. Sarah? Where are you going'? - To talk to him. -Well, he probably wants his privacy. Michael, you shouldn't inore him. He's helpin us. - He's been paid. -He didn't take anythin. Thank you, aain, for doin this. Really, from all of us. You know, you never told us your name. John. Where are you from? Bowie, Arizona. Why'd you leave? I ot drafted in Nam. And you just stayed? It's complicated. Do you have family back home? Father maybe, I don't know. Aren't you curious to see how thins miht have chaned back home? Got to have a reason for that. Sarah? Because of you, we're oin upriver. Any time you want to turn around, it's done. Okay. What is it? Who are they? Burmese pirates. Tell everyone to stay down. Don't make a sound. - Who are they? -it's all riht, it's all riht, just keep... Don't talk! - Any more of them? -Maybe. What do you want to do? We should keep oin. We made a commitment. I ain't talkin to you. What do you wanna do? We're a roup here. If they wanna vote, we'll vote. - Sit down! -If it's money they want, we'll can... Nobody talks. Heads down. Keep your heads down and nobody look them in the eye or they'll kill you. You have Iihts! Turn them on! I want to see you fuckin fools. Do it! This part of the river belons to us. You try to o past? We could kill you riht now. - Why didn't you respect us? -I respect you. We want what you have on the shit boat! Where are you white fools oin? - To brin medicine to the sick. -Look here. Is that a woman? Brin her here! Brin her! Take what you want and leave her alone! You shut up! You brin her! We'll pay you. I know you will. Brin her here! - We'll pay you all we have. -Fuck you! Get up! Get up, whore! No! What did you do? We came here to help stop the killin! - Who are you to take... -Who are you? - Let him o! -They would've raped her fifty times... and cut your fucking heads oâ€œ. Who are you? Who are any of you? We're oin back! No! No, we shouldn't o back. - Let o. -What are you doin? We are so close! What would happen here... it's horrible. But the people in there are bein killed like this everyday. Michael! This was your idea! We made a commitment. I know you don't believe in what we're doin... but it's our life. Our choice. You're not gonna change anythmg. Please. Please, John. Please. Go sit down. It's alriht. We'll be takin the overland route on the way back... so there's no need to wait around. I have to report this. I know you think what you did was riht... but takin a life is never riht. I don't know what to say. Maybe you shouldn't say anythin, should you? Good luck. Hey! Open. With power, throuh his spirit, in your inner bein... so Christ may dwell in your hearts with faith. And I pray. You may have power toether with all of us. Well, let me see if I can fix this little problem, okay? Hey you. Hand me one of those bandages'? Okay. Thank you. Okay. - Get outta here! -What about them? Go on, I'll take them! No! Come in here, calling Raven. Come on, Raven. What am I? You made me this way? A full-blooded combat soldier. You just don't turn it off. Talk to me, Johnny. You just don't turn it off! - It's over. -Nothing is over! When are you gonna come full circle? - I know the reasons you're here, John. -No! Aren't you curious to see how thins miht have chaned back home? Haven't you done enough damage'? You're always gonna be tearing away at yourself... until you come to terms with what you are. Until you come full-circle. - So you're just gonna stay here forever? -John! I wanna go home, I wanna go home. John Rambo! John? John Rambo? My name is Arthur Marsh... pastor of the Christchurch in Colorado. I need to talk with you. It's very important. I wouldn't have come here like this if it wasn't. The monfmg oi the day the group Mt... Michael Burnett notified me that they were travelin from this location. - What happened? -No one knows, exactly. They were supposed to return ten days ago, but they never came back. I requested help from the Embassy, but they can't help. Not in Burma. And not in time. How do you know they're alive? Because we've been in contact with the Karen Freedom Fihters... who say they think they know where they were taken. And I was iven the name of an ex-military American local... from the Embassy who put me in touch with men who say they have experience in this part of the world. Mercenaries. Yes. I don't have any other choice. You know the exact spot. We need you to take these men... to where you let our people off. When are they ready to leave? When you are. You know what you are. What you're made of. War is in your blood. Don't fight it. You didn't kill for your country. You killed for yourself. God's never gonna make that go away. When you're pushed... killing's as easy as breathing. My head was mangled And my words were torn Covered in blood Like a newly born Hey, the wishing well Sing it soft and low I stayed for a while In the hollow sound The only water came up From the ground Look at this fuckin place. Only a fuckin ape would live here. What the fuck am I doin here? HEY- Knock that shit off! - And you don't like the arts. -And you don't like shit. I like your sister, Diaz. She got a thing for retards. Hey, boat man. How much loner on this ancient piece of shit? So what did the Reverend say to you? Some shit about folks oin missin. I said to him, "Look, mate. That's what you et when you o trespassin into fuckin Burma. That's what you et when you o sniffin around other people's arbae. You know those enerals in there make millions crankin out meth... more than any other place on the fuckin planet. - Bullshit. -Millions, moron. How do you think they pay for that shit army? Yeah, try readin the paper, redneck, instead of sleepin under it. Fuckin enerals, biest junkies of all of them. -It's noble, Lewis. -You what? Those people oin in there with no weapons. Just books and meds. -It's noble. -Hey. Schoolboy. You stick your noble nose into other people's business, you et fucked up... or you get dead. The only reason I'm doin this is for an ex-wife and three kids. And after this shit is over, you can shove that soldierin riht up your ass. - Try the decaf, mate. -Fuck off. And you.
